Okay, so I have this economics question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question is about which policy will create the most inflation in the short run when the economy is operating at full employment.

First, I remember that when an economy is at full employment, it means it's already producing at its maximum potential. So any increase in aggregate demand beyond that can't be met by increasing production, which leads to inflation because there's more money chasing the same amount of goods.

Now, the question is about fiscal policiesâ€”government spending and taxes. I think I should recall how these policies affect aggregate demand. Expansionary fiscal policies increase AD, and contractionary policies decrease it.

Looking at the options, each one describes changes in government spending and taxes. I'll go through them one by one.

Option A: Increase in taxes, no change in spending. Higher taxes would reduce people's disposable income, so they spend less. That's contractionary, so it would decrease AD. Not inflationary.

Option B: No change in either. So AD remains the same; nothing happens. No inflation from this.

Option C: Spending increases but matched by equal tax increases. Hmm, so the government spends more, which should increase AD. But higher taxes take money out of people's pockets. The net effect depends on which effect is stronger. I think if they're equal, the impact might be small or neutral. Maybe not the biggest inflationary effect.

Option D: Decrease spending and increase taxes. Both are contractionary. So AD would decrease, leading to less inflation, maybe even deflation.

Option E: Increase spending, no change in taxes. Oh, this sounds like expansionary fiscal policy. The government is spending more, adding to AD. Since taxes aren't increased, people's disposable income isn't reduced. So this should increase AD a lot, leading to inflation when the economy can't produce more.

Option F: Decrease taxes and increase spending. That's like a double whammy. Lower taxes mean people have more money to spend, increasing consumption. Higher government spending directly adds to AD. So this should increase AD by a lot, more than just E. Since the economy is at full employment, this would cause significant inflation.

Option G: Decrease spending, no tax change. That's contractionary. AD goes down, so less inflation.

Option H: Increase taxes and decrease spending. Both contractionary. AD drops, so deflationary.

Option I: Decrease taxes, no spending change. Lower taxes increase disposable income, so people spend more, increasing AD. That's expansionary, leading to inflation. But perhaps not as much as when both spending and taxes are changed.

Option J: Decrease taxes and increase spending. Wait, this is the same as option F. Oh wait, no, let's see. The options are about which policies, so maybe F and J are similar. Wait, looking back: Option F says decrease taxes and increase spending. Option J is the same. Wait, no, maybe I mixed up. Let me check again. Oh, no, I think I wrote that right. So F and J are same, but looking at the options, maybe they are different. Let me check again. Wait, the options are labeled F and J. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in reading earlier.

Wait, let me re-clarify the options:

Option F: A decrease in taxes with an increase in government spending. So both are expansionary. So this would increase AD a lot, causing inflation.

Option J: A decrease in taxes and an increase in government spending. Wait, that's the same as F. Oh no, perhaps I'm getting confused because the options are a bit jumbled. Wait, no, maybe I wrote it wrong earlier. Let me look again.

Wait, looking back: The options are as follows:

Option F: Decrease in taxes with increase in spending.

Option J: Decrease in taxes and increase in spending. Wait, no, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial list. Let me read again.

Wait, the user wrote the options as:

F: A decrease in taxes with an increase in government spending

J: A decrease in taxes and an increase in government spending

Wait, that's the same as F and J. Oh, that can't be. Did I misread? Let me check again.

Looking at the user's list:

Options F and J are:

F: A decrease in taxes with an increase in government spending

J: A decrease in taxes and an increase in government spending.

Wait, that's the same thing. So perhaps it's a typo and J is different. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe I'm misremembering. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed.

Well, regardless, the point is to determine which policy would cause the largest increase in aggregate demand, thereby causing the most inflation.

So, when the economy is at full employment, any increase in AD will lead to inflation. The question is which policy increases AD the most.

Option E is increasing government spending without changing taxes. That would increase AD because G goes up. But since taxes aren't increased, the government is probably borrowing more, which could have other effects, but in terms of AD, it's a direct increase.

Option I is decreasing taxes without changing spending. That would increase disposable income, so consumption (C) would go up, increasing AD.

Options F and J (if they're the same) involve both decreasing taxes and increasing government spending. So both G and C would increase, leading to a larger increase in AD than either E or I alone.

So between E, F, I, and J, F and J would have the largest effect. But wait, perhaps in the options, only one of them is correct.

Wait, in the options, perhaps F and J are same, but looking back, perhaps J is different. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I got the options wrong. Let me recheck:

The options are:

A: Increase taxes, no change G

B: No change

C: G up, taxes up equally

D: G down, taxes up

E: G up, taxes same

F: Taxes down, G up

G: G down, taxes same

H: Taxes up, G down

I: Taxes down, G same

J: Taxes down, G up

So F and J are same? No, wait, wait: Option F is "A decrease in taxes with an increase in government spending." Option J is "A decrease in taxes and an increase in government spending." Oh, that's the same. So perhaps it's a duplication, but in reality, in the options, perhaps F and J are same. Wait, but that can't be. Unless I'm misreading.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me read the options again as given:

Option F: A decrease in taxes with an increase in government spending

Option J: A decrease in taxes and an increase in government spending.

So they're the same. That can't be right, so perhaps I misread. Alternatively, perhaps J is something else. Wait, perhaps in the initial setup, J is different. Let me recheck:

Looking back, the options are as follows:

E: An increase in government spending with no change in taxes

F: A decrease in taxes with an increase in government spending

J: A decrease in taxes and an increase in government spending.

Wait, that's odd. Unless it's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps J is 'A decrease in taxes and an increase in government spending' which is same as F. Maybe it's a mistake, but perhaps in the actual question, F and J are different.

Alternatively, perhaps in the initial setup, J is 'A decrease in taxes and an increase in government spending' which is same as F. But that would mean two same options, which is unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me read carefully.

Looking again:

The options are:

A: Increase in taxes with no change in G.

B: No change in G or taxes.

C: Increase G and increase taxes equally.

D: Decrease G and increase taxes.

E: Increase G, no change in taxes.

F: Decrease taxes with increase in G.

G: Decrease G, no change in taxes.

H: Increase taxes, decrease G.

I: Decrease taxes, no change in G.

J: Decrease taxes and increase in G.

Wait, so F is 'a decrease in taxes with an increase in G' and J is 'a decrease in taxes and an increase in G.' So they are the same. That can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake, but perhaps in reality, the options are different.

Wait, perhaps the correct options are:

Option F: Decrease taxes, increase G.

Option J: Decrease taxes, increase G. So same as F. But that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps J is 'a decrease in taxes with no change in G' but that's option I.

Wait, perhaps it's a typo, but I'll proceed.

Assuming that the correct options are as listed, and that F and J are same, but perhaps in reality, J is different, maybe 'a decrease in taxes and an increase in G' is correct.

But regardless, the effect of both decreasing taxes and increasing G is a larger increase in AD than either alone. So this would cause more inflation.

So among the options, the best answer would be either F or J, depending on how the options are set up. But given that, perhaps the correct answer is J, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but looking at the options again, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me list all options:

A: â†‘taxes, G same

B: G same, taxes same

C: G â†‘, taxes â†‘ same

D: G â†“, taxes â†‘

E: G â†‘, taxes same

F: taxes â†“, G â†‘

G: G â†“, taxes same

H: taxes â†‘, G â†“

I: taxes â†“, G same

J: taxes â†“, G â†‘

So F and J are same? No, because F says 'a decrease in taxes with an increase in G' and J says 'a decrease in taxes and an increase in G.' So same thing. That can't be, so perhaps I have a mistake in the initial setup.

Wait, perhaps in the actual options, F is 'a decrease in taxes and an increase in G' and J is 'a decrease in taxes and an increase in G.' So same. But that's impossible, so perhaps F is 'a decrease in taxes and an increase in G' and J is 'a decrease in taxes and an increase in transfer payments' or something else. But I think I must have made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps F is 'a decrease in taxes with an increase in G' and J is 'a decrease in taxes with an increase in G and an increase in something else.' But that's not what the options say.

Well, perhaps the answer is that F and J are same, but in the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key is to find which option leads to the largest increase in aggregate demand. So the options that expand AD the most are E, F, I, and J (if they're different).

Option E: G â†‘, taxes same. So G increases, which directly adds to AD.

Option F: taxes â†“, G â†‘. So both effects: lower taxes increase disposable income (C increases), and higher G directly adds. So this is a larger expansion than E.

Option I: taxes â†“, G same. So only C increases.

So F (and J, if same) would cause the largest increase in AD, leading to the most inflation.

So the correct answer would be F or J. But since in the options, F is 'a decrease in taxes with an increase in G' and J is 'a decrease in taxes and an increase in G,' perhaps they're same. But that's impossible, so maybe I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F. Or maybe J, but perhaps the intended answer is E.

Wait, another approach: when the economy is at full employment, any increase in AD leads to inflation. So which policy would increase AD the most.

Expansionary fiscal policies are when G increases or taxes decrease, or both.

So the most expansionary would be both G increases and taxes decrease, as that adds more to AD.

So the correct answer would be the option where both G increases and taxes decrease.

Looking back, that's option F: taxes decrease and G increases.

So the answer is F.

Wait, but if J is same as F, then perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the options are misnumbered.

Wait, looking back: the options are A-J, with F and J as different. So perhaps I need to recheck.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the letters. Let me look again.

Wait, the options are:

E: increase G, no change in taxes.

F: decrease taxes and increase G.

I: decrease taxes, no change in G.

J: decrease taxes and increase G.

Wait, that can't be. So perhaps J is same as F, but that's impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps J is 'a decrease in taxes and an increase in G' which is same as F, but that can't be.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake here. Let me try to list all the options properly.

Given the initial setup, the options are:

A: Increase in taxes, no change G.

B: No change.

C: G up, taxes up same.

D: G down, taxes up.

E: G up, taxes same.

F: Taxes down, G up.

G: G down, taxes same.

H: Taxes up, G down.

I: Taxes down, G same.

J: Taxes down, G up.

Wait, so F and J are same. That can't be, so perhaps I misread. Let me check again.

Wait, the user wrote:

F: A decrease in taxes with an increase in government spending

J: A decrease in taxes and an increase in government spending

So same thing. So perhaps in reality, the correct answer is F or J, but since both are same, perhaps the intended answer is F or E.

Wait, perhaps the intended answer is F, as it's the first occurrence.

But in any case, the policy that increases G and decreases taxes would have the largest effect on AD, leading to more inflation.

So the correct answer is option F: A decrease in taxes with an increase in government spending.

Wait, but looking at the options again, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

When the economy is at full employment, any increase in AD beyond that causes inflation.

So which of these options would cause the largest increase in AD?

- Increasing G (E) would increase AD.

- Decreasing taxes (I) would increase AD.

- Doing both (F and J) would increase AD more than either alone.

So the most inflationary would be F or J. But since F and J are same, perhaps the correct answer is F.

Wait, but maybe I'm confusing the letters.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E, but that doesn't make sense because E is only increasing G, while F is both increasing G and cutting taxes.

So F is better.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E, but no, because F has a bigger effect.

So I think the answer is F.
</think>

When the economy is operating at full employment, any increase in aggregate demand (AD) beyond the economy's productive capacity will lead to inflation. Fiscal policies that increase AD include expansionary measures such as increasing government spending (G) or cutting taxes (T). The question asks which policy would create the most inflation in the short run.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A**: Increase in taxes with no change in government spending  
   - Higher taxes reduce disposable income, leading to lower consumption and a contraction in AD. This is deflationary, not inflationary.

2. **Option B**: No change in government spending or taxes  
   - AD remains unchanged, so no inflationary effect.

3. **Option C**: Increase in government spending matched by an equal increase in taxes  
   - The increase in G directly adds to AD, but the equal increase in taxes reduces disposable income, offsetting some of the expansionary effect. The net impact is smaller compared to policies with no offsetting tax changes.

4. **Option D**: Decrease in government spending and a matching increase in taxes  
   - Both actions are contractionary, reducing AD and leading to deflation rather than inflation.

5. **Option E**: Increase in government spending with no change in taxes  
   - Increasing G directly adds to AD, leading to inflation. However, this effect is smaller than if taxes were also cut, as higher taxes or no tax change limits the expansion.

6. **Option F**: Decrease in taxes with an increase in government spending  
   - Cutting taxes increases disposable income, boosting consumption, while increasing G directly adds to AD. This combination of lower taxes and higher G creates the largest increase in AD and the most inflation.

7. **Option G**: Decrease in government spending with no change in taxes  
   - Lower G reduces AD, leading to deflation.

8. **Option H**: Increase in taxes and a decrease in government spending  
   - Both actions are contractionary, reducing AD and leading to deflation.

9. **Option I**: Decrease in taxes with no change in government spending  
   - Lower taxes increase disposable income and consumption, boosting AD. However, this effect is smaller than if G were also increased.

10. **Option J**: Decrease in taxes and an increase in government spending  
    - This is identical to Option F, as it combines lower taxes and higher G, leading to the largest increase in AD and the most inflation.

### Conclusion:
The policy that creates the most inflation in the short run is the one that combines a decrease in taxes and an increase in government spending, as this leads to the largest increase in AD. Both Options F and J describe the same policy, but since only one answer can be selected, the correct choice is:

**F: A decrease in taxes with an increase in government spending.**
