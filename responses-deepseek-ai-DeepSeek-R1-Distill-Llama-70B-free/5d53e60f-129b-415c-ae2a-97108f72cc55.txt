Okay, so I've got this probability problem to solve. Let me read it carefully.

So, the question is about two cities with different income distributions. Both are Pareto-type distributions. The first city's income is modeled by f(x) = 2/x³, where x is between 1 and infinity. The second city's income is modeled by g(y) = 3/y⁴, same range for y. And one unit is $20,000, but I think the actual dollar amount won't matter for the calculation since we're dealing with probabilities.

The problem is to find P(X < Y), where X and Y are the incomes of randomly selected people from each city. So, we need the probability that a person from the first city has a lower income than someone from the second city.

Hmm, because X and Y are independent, right? Since we're selecting one person from each city, their incomes are independent events.

So, P(X < Y) is like the probability that one random variable is less than another. I remember that when dealing with two independent continuous random variables, the probability P(X < Y) can be found by integrating the joint probability over the region where X is less than Y.

Since X and Y are independent, their joint pdf is just the product of their individual pdfs. So, the joint pdf is f(x) * g(y) = (2/x³) * (3/y⁴) = 6/(x³ y⁴).

So, the probability P(X < Y) is the double integral over all x < y of this joint pdf. But since x and y are both greater than 1, I need to set up the limits correctly.

Wait, let me think. The condition is x < y, with x >1 and y >1. So, for each possible x, y can range from x to infinity. Or alternatively, for each possible y, x can go from 1 to y.

Which approach is easier? Well, integrating over x first might be easier. So, fix y, then x ranges from 1 to y. So, the integral would be:

P(X < Y) = ∫ (from y=1 to ∞) [ ∫ (from x=1 to x=y) f(x)g(y) dx ] dy

Wait, no, because f(x) and g(y) are separate functions. So, substituting, it's:

= ∫ (y=1 to ∞) [ ∫ (x=1 to y) (2/x³) * (3/y⁴) dx ] dy

Wait, but wait, the joint pdf is f(x)g(y), which is (2/x³)(3/y⁴) = 6/(x³ y⁴). So, the inner integral is over x from 1 to y of 6/(x³ y⁴) dx.

Let me compute the inner integral first. Since y is treated as a constant when integrating over x, I can take 6/(y⁴) outside the integral.

So, inner integral becomes (6/y⁴) ∫ (x=1 to y) (1/x³) dx.

The integral of 1/x³ is ∫ x^(-3) dx = [x^(-2)/(-2)] + C = -1/(2x²) + C.

Evaluated from x=1 to x=y:

At y: -1/(2y²)
At 1: -1/(2*1²) = -1/2

So, the integral is [ -1/(2y²) - (-1/2) ) ] = (1/2 - 1/(2y²) )

Multiply this by 6/y⁴:

(6/y⁴) * (1/2 - 1/(2y²)) = (6/y⁴)*( (y² -1)/(2y²) ) )  [because 1/2 is (y²)/(2y²) and 1/(2y²) is 1/(2y²), so when subtracted, (y²-1)/(2y²) ) ]

So, this becomes 6*(y²-1)/(2 y⁶) )

Simplify numerator and denominator: 6/2 is 3, so 3(y²-1)/y⁶.

Which can be written as 3(y² -1)/y⁶ = 3(1/y⁴ - 1/y⁶ )

Wait, let me check:

(y²-1) is y²(1 - 1/y²) → but perhaps just leave it as is for now.

So, the outer integral becomes the integral from y=1 to ∞ of [3(y² -1)/y⁶ ] dy.

Let me write this as 3 ∫ (from 1 to ∞) (y² -1)/y⁶ dy = 3 ∫ (y^{-4} - y^{-6}) dy.

Integrate term by term.

The integral of y^{-4} is [ y^{-3} / (-3) ) ] + C = -1/(3y³) + C.

Similarly, integral of y^{-6} is [ y^{-5} / (-5) ) ] + C = -1/(5 y^5 ) + C.

So, putting it together, the integral from 1 to ∞ is:

3 [ ( -1/(3y³) + 1/(5 y^5) ) evaluated from y=1 to y=∞ ]

Let's compute the limits. As y approaches infinity, both terms go to zero because the denominators are getting large.

At y=1:

-1/(3*1³) = -1/3

1/(5 *1^5 ) = 1/5

So, substituting, the expression becomes:

3 [ (0 - 0 ) - ( (-1/3) + (1/5) ) ) ]

Wait, wait. No, the integral is evaluated as [ upper limit (inf) minus lower limit (1) ].

So, the expression is:

3 [ (0 + 0 ) - ( (-1/3) + (1/5) ) ) ]

Wait, no. Let me clarify.

The integral from 1 to ∞ of (y^{-4} - y^{-6}) dy is [ (-1/(3y³) ) - ( -1/(5 y^5) )) ] evaluated from 1 to ∞.

Wait, no: Wait, the integral of (y^{-4} - y^{-6}) is [ (-1/(3 y³)) + (1/(5 y^5)) ) ] from 1 to ∞.

So when y approaches ∞, the terms become zero.

At y=1, it's [ (-1/3) + (1/5) ) ].

So, the whole integral is [ (0) - ( (-1/3 + 1/5) ) ] = (1/3 - 1/5) = (5/15 -3/15 )= 2/15.

But wait, the integral is multiplied by 3, so 3*(2/15) )= 6/15 = 2/5.

Wait, that can't be right. Because 3 times (2/15) is 6/15=2/5, which is 0.4.

Looking at the options, 2/5 is option G.

But let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake.

Let me go back step by step.

Inner integral: ∫ (x=1 to y) (2/x³) dx.

Integral of 2/x³ is 2*(x^(-2)/(-2)) ) + C = -1/x² + C.

Evaluated from 1 to y: [ -1/y² - ( -1/1² ) ] = (-1/y² +1) = (1 -1/y²).

So, the inner integral is (1 -1/y²).

Then, the joint part is (2/x³)*(3/y⁴ dx dy) → Wait no, I think I messed up earlier.

Wait, I think I made a mistake in the setup. Let me start over.

The correct approach is:

P(X < Y) = ∫ (y=1 to ∞) ∫ (x=1 to y) f(x)g(y) dx dy.

Which is:

∫_{y=1}^∞ [ ∫_{x=1}^y (2/x³)(3/y⁴) dx ] dy.

Wait, f(x) is 2/x³, and g(y) is 3/y⁴. Since they're independent, the joint pdf is f(x)g(y) = 6/(x³ y⁴).

So, the inner integral is ∫_{x=1}^y (6/(x³ y⁴)) dx.

Factor out 6/y⁴, since it's independent of x:

6/y⁴ ∫_{x=1}^y x^{-3} dx.

Compute the integral of x^{-3} from 1 to y:

Integral x^{-3} dx is [x^{-2}/(-2)] from 1 to y → [ (-1/(2x²) ) ] from 1 to y.

At y: (-1/(2y²)).

At 1: (-1/(2*(1)^2))= -1/2.

So, the integral is [ (-1/(2y²)) - (-1/2) ) ] = (1/2 - 1/(2y²)).

Multiply by 6/y⁴:

6/y⁴ * (1/2 - 1/(2y²)) = 6/(y⁴) * [ (y² -1)/(2y²) ) ]

Wait, because 1/2 is (y²)/(2y²) and 1/(2y²) is 1/(2y²), so when subtracted, (y² -1)/(2y²).

So,

6/(y⁴) * (y² -1)/(2 y²) ) = [6 (y² -1) ] / (2 y^6 ) = [3 (y² -1) ] / y^6.

Which simplifies to 3(y² -1)/y^6 = 3(1/y^4 - 1/y^6).

Now, integrate this from y=1 to y=∞:

P(X < Y) = ∫_{1}^{∞} 3(1/y⁴ - 1/y^6 ) dy.

Factor out the 3:

3 ∫_{1}^{∞} ( y^{-4} - y^{-6} ) dy.

Compute the integral term by term.

Integral of y^{-4} is y^{-3}/(-3) = -1/(3y³).

Integral of y^{-6} is y^{-5}/(-5) = -1/(5 y^5).

So, the integral becomes:

3 [ (-1/(3 y³)) - (-1/(5 y^5)) ) ] evaluated from 1 to ∞.

Which is:

3 [ ( -1/(3 y³) + 1/(5 y^5) ) ] from 1 to ∞.

Evaluate the limits.

As y approaches ∞, both terms go to zero.

At y=1: 

-1/(3*(1)^3) + 1/(5*(1)^5) = -1/3 + 1/5 = (-5 +3)/15 = (-2)/15.

So putting it together:

At upper limit (y=∞): 0.

At lower limit (y=1): (-2/15).

So, the integral is [ 0 - (-2/15) ] = 2/15.

Multiply by 3: 3*(2/15) = 6/15 = 2/5.

Wait, but 2/5 is 0.4, which is one of the options. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A: 1/2

B: 3/5

C:4/5

D:3/4

E:2/3

F:1/4

G:2/5 → 0.4

H:1/5

I:5/6

J:1/3

So, 2/5 is option G.

But wait a second, I'm getting 2/5, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again about the approach.

Another approach to compute P(X < Y) is to realize that since X and Y are independent, the probability can be written as E[ P(X < Y | Y) ].

Which is the expectation over Y of the probability that X is less than Y.

So, for a given Y=y, P(X < y) is the CDF of X evaluated at y.

The CDF of X, F_X(y), is the integral from 1 to y of f(x) dx.

f(x)=2/x³, so integral is 2 ∫ x^{-3} dx from 1 to y.

Which is 2 [ (-1/(2x²)) ] from 1 to y → 2 [ (-1/(2 y²)) + 1/(2 *1²) ) ] = 2 [ (1/2 - 1/(2 y²) ) ] = (1 - 1/y²).

So, F_X(y) = 1 - 1/y².

Then, P(X < Y) = E[ F_X(Y) ] = integral from y=1 to ∞ of F_X(y) * g(y) dy.

Which is ∫_{1}^∞ (1 - 1/y²) * (3/y⁴) dy.

Let me compute this:

= ∫ (3/y⁴ - 3/y^6 ) dy from 1 to ∞.

Which is 3 ∫ y^{-4} dy - 3 ∫ y^{-6} dy.

Integrate:

= 3 [ y^{-3}/(-3) ) ] - 3 [ y^{-5}/(-5) ) ] + C.

= [ - y^{-3} + (3/(5)) y^{-5} ) ] evaluated from 1 to ∞.

At y=∞, both terms are zero.

At y=1:

-1^{-3} + (3/5)(1^{-5}) = -1 + 3/5 = (-5/5 + 3/5) = (-2/5).

So, the integral is [0 - (-2/5)] = 2/5.

So, P(X < Y) = 2/5, which is option G.

Wait, but earlier when I did it the first way, I got the same result. So that's consistent.

But wait, when I first did the double integral, I got 2/5, and using expectation, I also got 2/5. So seems correct.

But wait, wait another thing. Let me think about symmetry or another approach to verify.

Alternatively, since X and Y are independent, P(X < Y) + P(Y < X) = 1 - P(X=Y). But since they are continuous, P(X=Y)=0, so P(X < Y) = 1 - P(Y < X).

But maybe computing P(Y < X) is easier, and then subtract from 1.

Alternatively, perhaps compute P(Y < X) and see if it's 3/5, so that 1 - 3/5 = 2/5.

Wait, let me think about that.

Compute P(Y < X) = ∫ (x=1 to ∞) ∫ (y=1 to x) g(y) f(x) dy dx.

Which would be similar steps, but switching x and y.

But perhaps let me compute P(Y < X) using the same method as before.

P(Y < X) = E[ P(Y < X | X=x) ].

The CDF of Y is G(x) = ∫ from 1 to x of 3/y⁴ dy.

Compute that: integral of 3 y^{-4} dy is 3 * (y^{-3}/(-3)) ) + C = - y^{-3} + C.

Evaluated from 1 to x: [ -1/x³ - ( -1/1³ ) ] = (1 -1/x³).

So, G(x) = 1 - 1/x³.

Then, P(Y < X) is ∫ from x=1 to ∞ of G(x) f(x) dx.

Which is ∫ (1 -1/x³) * (2/x³) dx from 1 to ∞.

= ∫ (2/x³ - 2/x^6 ) dx from 1 to ∞.

Integrate term by term:

Integral of 2/x³ is 2 * (x^{-2}/(-2)) ) = -1/x².

Integral of 2/x^6 is 2 * (x^{-5}/(-5)) ) = -2/(5 x^5).

So, the integral becomes [ -1/x² + 2/(5 x^5) ] evaluated from 1 to ∞.

At x=∞: both terms are zero.

At x=1: [ -1/1 + 2/(5*1) ) ] = (-1 + 2/5 )= (-3/5).

So, the integral is [0 - (-3/5)] = 3/5.

Therefore, P(Y < X) = 3/5.

So, since P(X < Y) + P(Y < X) =1, then P(X < Y) = 1 - 3/5 = 2/5.

Which matches our previous result. So, I'm confident now that the correct answer is 2/5, which is option G.

To compute \( P(X < Y) \), we start by noting that \( X \) and \( Y \) are independent continuous random variables with Pareto-type distributions:

\[
f(x) = \frac{2}{x^3}, \quad 1 < x < \infty, \quad \text{and} \quad g(y) = \frac{3}{y^4}, \quad 1 < y < \infty.
\]

The joint probability density function (pdf) is:

\[
f(x)g(y) = \frac{6}{x^3 y^4}.
\]

The probability \( P(X < Y) \) is given by the double integral over the region \( x < y \):

\[
P(X < Y) = \int_{y=1}^\infty \int_{x=1}^y \frac{6}{x^3 y^4} \, dx \, dy.
\]

### Step 1: Inner Integral
First, compute the inner integral over \( x \) for a fixed \( y \):

\[
\int_{x=1}^y \frac{6}{x^3 y^4}
