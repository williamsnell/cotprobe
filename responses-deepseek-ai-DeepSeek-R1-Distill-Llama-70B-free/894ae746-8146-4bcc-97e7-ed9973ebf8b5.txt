Okay, so I've got this property law question here about future interests in real property. Hmm, I remember future interests can be a bit tricky, but let's try to break it down.

The question is about a grantor who conveyed his apartment building with a deed that has several conditions. The conveyance goes like this: "to my son for life, then to my uncle for life, but if my uncle moves to another state, to my brother for the life of my uncle, then to the heirs of my uncle if my uncle does not move to another state, and to the heirs of my brother if my uncle does move to another state."

The question asks about the brother's interest during the son's lifetime. The options are various types of remainders and executory interests.

Wait, so the son gets a life estate. Then after the son dies, it goes to the uncle for life. But if the uncle moves, then during the uncle's life, it goes to the brother. After that, depending on whether the uncle moved, it goes to either the uncle's heirs or the brother's heirs.

But during the son's lifetime, what's the brother's interest?

Let's think about the structure. The son has a life estate. After the son dies, the uncle gets a life estate, but there's a condition: if the uncle moves, the brother gets a life estate measured by the uncle's life. Then, after that, the property goes to either the uncle's heirs or the brother's heirs, depending on whether the uncle moved.

So, the brother's interest is a future interest that might take effect only if the uncle moves. So it's contingent upon the uncle moving. Also, the brother's interest is for the life of the uncle, which is a life estate pur autre vie.

But wait, the brother's interest is not a remainder because a remainder follows a life estate and takes effect immediately upon the termination of the prior estate. Here, after the son's life estate, the uncle gets a life estate. So the brother's interest is an executory interest because it's cutting short the uncle's estate upon a condition (moving).

So, the brother's interest is an executory interest. Since it's measured by the uncle's life, it would be a life estate pur autre vie, but it's subject to a condition precedent (the uncle moving). So it's a contingent executory interest pur autre vie.

Wait, but let me think again. The initial conveyance is to the son for life, then to the uncle for life. But if the uncle moves, then during the uncle's life, it goes to the brother for the uncle's life. So the brother's interest is an executory interest because it's taking effect upon a condition (the uncle moving) and it's replacing the uncle's interest.

So the brother's interest is a shifting executory interest because it's shifting from the uncle to the brother upon the condition. And it's pur autre vie because it's measured by the uncle's life.

But I'm a bit confused about the contingent vs. vested aspect. Since the condition hasn't happened yet (the uncle hasn't moved), the brother's interest is contingent upon that condition. So it's a contingent shifting executory interest pur autre vie.

Looking at the options:

Option D: shifting executory interest pur autre vie.

But does it say contingent? Hmm, option G is contingent executory interest pur autre vie. Option D might just be shifting without the contingent part.

Wait, the initial grant is to the uncle for life, but if he moves, then to the brother for the uncle's life. So the brother's interest is contingent on the uncle moving. So it's a contingent executory interest.

So the correct classification is a contingent executory interest pur autre vie. So option G.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option D: shifting executory interest pur autre vie.

Option G: contingent executory interest pur autre vie.

So which one applies here?

Because the brother's interest is contingent on the uncle moving, so it's a contingent executory interest. So G is the right answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes shifting executory interests can also be contingent. Let me make sure.

In this case, the executory interest is shifting from the uncle to the brother upon a contingency (the uncle moving). So the brother's interest is a shifting executory interest that is contingent on the uncle moving. So it's a contingent shifting executory interest.

So looking at the options, G says "contingent executory interest pur autre vie" and D is "shifting executory interest pur autre vie."

Wait, does the option include "shifting"? Because I think it's both shifting and contingent.

But the options don't have both. So which is more accurate?

I think the primary description would be that it's contingent because it's subject to a condition precedent. So G would be the answer.

Alternatively, maybe it's a shifting executory interest regardless of whether it's contingent.

Wait, the brother's interest is a shifting executory interest because it's shifting the interest from the uncle's estate to the brother upon the condition. But whether it's contingent depends on whether the condition has occurred.

Since the condition (moving) hasn't happened yet, the executory interest is contingent. So the brother's interest is a contingent shifting executory interest pur autre vie.

Looking at the options, G is "contingent executory interest pur autre vie." D is "shifting executory interest pur autre vie." So which one is correct?

Hmm, perhaps "shifting" describes the type of executory interest, whereas "contingent" describes its nature. So the correct answer would include both aspects. But the options don't combine them.

Wait, maybe the question is only testing on whether it's contingent or vested. So, since the brother's interest is subject to a condition (the uncle moving), it's a contingent executory interest. So G would be the correct answer.

Alternatively, since the brother's interest is an executory interest that shifts, it's option D. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Another approach: Let's outline the interests.

The son has a life estate.

After the son's death, the uncle has a life estate, but if the uncle moves, then during the uncle's life, it goes to the brother for the uncle's life. Then, after that life estate, it goes to either the uncle's or the brother's heirs.

So, the brother's interest is an executory interest because it's taking effect after the prior estate (the uncle's) is divested due to a condition (moving). So it's an executory interest, not a remainder.

The brother's interest is also pur autre vie because it's measured by the uncle's life.

Since the condition (uncle moving) hasn't occurred yet, the brother's interest is contingent. So it's a contingent executory interest pur autre vie, which is option G.

Yes, I think that's correct. So the answer should be G.

The grantor conveyed his apartment building with the following language: "to my son for life, then to my uncle for life, but if my uncle moves to another state, to my brother for the life of my uncle, then to the heirs of my uncle if my uncle does not move to another state, and to the heirs of my brother if my uncle does move to another state." The question asks about the brother's interest during the son's lifetime.

The son has a life estate, and the uncle has a life estate following the son's death. However, the uncle's life estate is subject to a condition: if the uncle moves to another state, the property will instead go to the brother for the life of the uncle. After the uncle's life estate (or the brother's life estate, if the condition is triggered), the property will pass to either the uncle's heirs or the brother's heirs, depending on whether the uncle moved.

The brother's interest is not a remainder because it does not follow a life estate and take effect immediately upon the termination of the prior estate. Instead, it is an executory interest because it takes effect upon a condition (the uncle moving) and replaces the uncle's interest. Since the condition (the uncle moving) has not yet occurred, the brother's interest is contingent. Additionally, the brother's interest is measured by the uncle's life, making it pur autre vie.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Contingent remainder pur autre vie — Incorrect, as the brother's interest is not a remainder but an executory interest.
- **Option B**: Vested remainder absolute — Incorrect, as the brother's interest is contingent and not vested.
- **Option C**: Estate pur autre vie — Incorrect, as this describes a present interest, not a future interest.
- **Option D**: Shifting executory interest pur autre vie — Incorrect, as this option does not account for the contingent nature of the brother's interest.
- **Option E**: Vested remainder pur autre vie — Incorrect, as the brother's interest is contingent, not vested.
- **Option F**: Contingent remainder in fee simple — Incorrect, as the brother's interest is not a remainder and is pur autre vie.
- **Option G**: Contingent executory interest pur autre vie — Correct, as the brother's interest is contingent on the uncle moving and is an executory interest measured by the uncle's life.
- **Option H**: Vested remainder in fee simple — Incorrect, as the brother's interest is contingent and not vested.
- **Option I**: Vested executory interest pur autre vie — Incorrect, as the brother's interest is contingent, not vested.
- **Option J**: Contingent remainder absolute — Incorrect, as the brother's interest is not a remainder and is pur autre vie.

The brother's interest is best described as a **contingent executory interest pur autre vie**.
