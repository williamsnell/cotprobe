Question:

During the study of the reaction A → 2B, a chemist constructs several graphs. The graph of [A] versus time and the graph of ln [A] versus time both give a curved line; however, the graph of 1/[A] versus time and gives a straight line. This implies the rate law is

Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about reaction kinetics. The reaction is A turning into 2B, and the chemist made several graphs. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that when they plot [A] vs. time, it's a curved line. Same with ln[A] vs. time. But when they graph 1/[A] vs. time, it's a straight line. Hmm, I need to figure out the rate law.

I remember that different rate laws produce different kinds of graphs. Let's see... For a zero-order reaction, the rate is independent of the concentration. The rate law is Rate = k. The integrated rate law for zero-order is [A] = -kt + [A]_0. So if you plot [A] against time, it's a straight line with a negative slope. But wait, the question says that [A] vs time is curved. So that can't be zero-order. Or can it? Oh wait, no, because a straight line would mean zero-order. So since it's curved, not zero.

First-order reactions have a rate law Rate = k[A]. The integrated rate law is ln[A] = -kt + ln[A]_0. So a plot of ln[A] vs time is a straight line. But the question says that ln[A] vs time is curved. So that's not first-order either.

Hmm, so what about second-order reactions? The rate law is Rate = k[A]^2. The integrated rate law for second-order is 1/[A] = kt + 1/[A]_0. So a plot of 1/[A] vs time gives a straight line. Oh! That's exactly what the question says. So that would mean the reaction is second-order.

Wait, but wait a second. The reaction is A → 2B. The stoichiometry doesn't affect the rate law, right? The rate law depends on the mechanism, not the balanced equation. So the rate is based on how the concentration of A changes, regardless of the coefficients in the balanced equation.

So according to the given graphs, since 1/[A] vs time is straight, it's a second-order reaction. So the rate law should be Rate = k[A]^2.

Looking at the options, option C is Rate = k[A]^2.

Wait, but let me check the other possibilities. For a third-order reaction, the integrated rate law would involve 1/[A]^2, I think. Because for third-order, the equation is 1/(2[A]^2) = kt + 1/(2[A]_0^2). So a plot of 1/[A]^2 vs t would be linear. But the question says 1/[A] is linear, which fits second-order.

So yeah, I think the correct answer is option C.

The reaction under study is A → 2B, and the chemist observes the following: 

1. A plot of [A] vs. time is curved.
2. A plot of ln[A] vs. time is also curved.
3. A plot of 1/[A] vs. time is a straight line.

These observations provide critical clues about the rate law. 

- For a **zero-order reaction**, the integrated rate law is [A] = -kt + [A]₀, which would produce a straight line for [A] vs. time. Since the [A] vs. time graph is curved, the reaction is not zero-order.
- For a **first-order reaction**, the integrated rate law is ln[A] = -kt + ln[A]₀, which would produce a straight line for ln[A] vs. time. Since the ln[A] vs. time graph is curved, the reaction is not first-order.
- For a **second-order reaction**, the integrated rate law is 1/[A] = kt + 1/[A]₀, which would produce a straight line for 1/[A] vs. time. The fact that the 1/[A] vs. time graph is straight confirms that the reaction is second-order.

The stoichiometry of the reaction (A → 2B) does not influence the rate law, as the rate law depends on the mechanism rather than the coefficients in the balanced equation. Therefore, the rate law for this reaction is **Rate = k[A]²**, corresponding to a second-order reaction.

From the given options, the correct choice is:

**C: Rate = k[A]²**

Answer: C
