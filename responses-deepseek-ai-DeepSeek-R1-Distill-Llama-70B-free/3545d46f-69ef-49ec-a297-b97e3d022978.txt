Okay, so I've got this statistics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll give it a try. Let me read the question again. It says that we have a set of eight ordered values: 3, 5, 6, 6, 7, 9, 16, 20. The question is about how adding two relatively high values affects the measures of central tendency, which are the mean, median, and mode.

Wait, wait, wait. Oh, no, the question says "the distribution of the previous problem." But since I don't have that, I'll focus on the given data. So, the original data is eight numbers: 3,5,6,6,7,9,16,20. Then, we're adding two relatively high values. But wait, the question seems to present those eight numbers as the new set after adding two high values. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently. Oh, maybe the previous problem had some data, and now we've added two high values to it, resulting in these eight numbers. Or perhaps the question is about adding two high values to this existing set. Wait, the way the question is phrased is a bit confusing.

Wait, the question says: "Use the following eight ordered values: 3,5,6,6,7,9,16,20." So those are the data points after adding two high values. So, the original data might have been without the 16 and 20, but I'm not sure. But the question is about the effect on the measures when two high values are added. So, I think the correct approach is to compute the mean, median, and mode before and after adding the two high values, but since the given data is after adding, perhaps I need to think about how adding those two affects each measure.

Alternatively, maybe the question is just using these eight numbers, and the point is to see how each measure is affected by the presence of high values. Let me proceed.

So, the measures of central tendency are mean (average), median (middle value), and mode (most frequent value). 

Let's compute each for the given data:

Mean: sum of all values divided by the number of values.

The values are 3,5,6,6,7,9,16,20. That's eight numbers.

Sum = 3 +5 =8; 8+6=14; 14+6=20; 20+7=27; 27+9=36; 36+16=52; 52+20=72.

Mean = 72 / 8 = 9.

Median: Since there are even numbers (8), the median is the average of the 4th and 5th values.

Looking at the ordered list: positions 1:3,2:5,3:6,4:6,5:7,6:9,7:16,8:20.

So 4th is 6, 5th is 7. Median = (6+7)/2 = 6.5.

Mode is the most frequent value. Looking at the data: 3 occurs once, 5 once, 6 twice, 7 once, 9 once, 16 once, 20 once. So the mode is 6.

Now, the question is about how adding two high values affects these. Wait, but the given data already includes 16 and 20 as the high values. So perhaps the original data didn't have those, and adding them caused changes. So to find the effect, I should compare the original data (without 16 and 20) to the new data (with them added). 

Original data (before adding 16 and 20) would have been: 3,5,6,6,7,9. That's six numbers.

Compute measures for original:

Mean_original = (3+5+6+6+7+9) /6. Sum is 3+5=8, +6=14, +6=20, +7=27, +9=36. So 36/6=6.

Median_original: With six numbers, the median is average of 3rd and 4th values. The ordered list is 3,5,6,6,7,9. So 3rd is 6, 4th is6. Median=6.

Mode_original: same as before; 6 appears twice. So mode is 6.

Now, after adding 16 and 20: new data is 3,5,6,6,7,9,16,20.

As calculated earlier, new mean is 9, new median is 6.5, mode remains 6.

So, what's the effect on each measure?

Mean increased from 6 to 9. That's a significant change.

Median was 6, now 6.5. A small increase.

Mode remained 6; no change.

So, adding two high values affects the mean the most, the median somewhat, and the mode not at all.

Wait, but wait. The original data had a mode of 6, same as the new data. So mode is unaffected.

Mean went from 6 to 9: that's a big change, up by 3.

Median went from 6 to 6.5: a change of 0.5.

So, the mean is most affected, the median is somewhat affected, and the mode is unaffected.

Looking at the options:

Option F: Mean is most affected, median is somewhat affected, mode is unaffected.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Options:

A: Mean unaffected, median somewhat, mode most.

No, opposite here.

B: Median most, mean somewhat, mode unaffected.

No, in our case, mean is most.

C: All unaffected. No.

D: Mean and median equally, mode most.

No, mode is same.

E: All equally. No.

F: Mean most, median somewhat, mode unaffected.

Yes.

G: Median unaffected? No, median went up.

H: Mode and median equally. No, mode didn't change.

I: Mode unaffected, mean somewhat, median most. No, mean is most.

J: Mode most. No.

So the correct answer is F.

To analyze the effect of adding two relatively high values (16 and 20) on the measures of central tendency (mean, median, and mode), we compare the original dataset (3, 5, 6, 6, 7, 9) with the new dataset (3, 5, 6, 6, 7, 9, 16, 20).

### Original Dataset (3, 5, 6, 6, 7, 9):
1. **Mean**:  
   \[
   \text{Mean} = \frac{3 + 5 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 9}{6} = \frac{36}{6} = 6
   \]
2. **Median**:  
   Since there are 6 values, the median is the average of the 3rd and 4th values:  
   \[
   \text{Median} = \frac{6 + 6}{2} = 6
   \]
3. **Mode**:  
   The mode is the most frequent value. Here, 6 appears twice, so:  
   \[
   \text{Mode} = 6
   \]

### New Dataset (3, 5, 6, 6, 7, 9, 16, 20):
1. **Mean**:  
   \[
   \text{Mean} = \frac{3 + 5 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 9 + 16 + 20}{8} = \frac{72}{8} = 9
   \]
   The mean increases significantly from 6 to 9.
2. **Median**:  
   Since there are 8 values, the median is the average of the 4th and 5th values:  
   \[
   \text{Median} = \frac{6 + 7}{2} = 6.5
   \]
   The median increases slightly from 6 to 6.5.
3. **Mode**:  
   The mode remains 6, as it is still the most frequent value.  
   \[
   \text{Mode} = 6
   \]

### Conclusion:
- The **mean** is most affected, increasing significantly from 6 to 9.  
- The **median** is somewhat affected, increasing slightly from 6 to 6.5.  
- The **mode** is unaffected, remaining 6.  

Thus, the correct answer is:

**F: Mean is most affected, median is somewhat affected, mode is unaffected.**
