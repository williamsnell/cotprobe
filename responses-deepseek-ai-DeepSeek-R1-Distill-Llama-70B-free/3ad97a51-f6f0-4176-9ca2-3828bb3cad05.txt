Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about COSO and internal control monitoring. I need to figure out which option is the exception, meaning it's not a step in their approach. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that COSO stands for the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations, and they have a framework for internal control. They probably outline specific steps for monitoring internal controls effectively. So the question is asking which of these options is NOT one of those steps.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Increasing the reliability of financial reporting and compliance with laws. That sounds like a goal rather than a specific step in the monitoring process. But wait, COSO does talk about achieving objectives, so maybe this is part of it.

Option B: Regularly updating procedures as business changes. That makes sense because businesses evolve, so monitoring should adapt. So this is likely a step they include.

Option C: Conducting surprise audits regularly. Surprise audits can be a way to monitor effectively, so probably yes, COSO would include this.

Option D: Implementing a whistle-blowing system. Whistleblower policies are part of internal control, allowing employees to report issues. So this is probably a step.

Option E: Designing procedures based on risks to achieve objectives. Yes, COSO emphasizes risk assessment, so this fits.

Option F: Establishing a foundation for monitoring. That sounds like a starting point, so definitely a step.

Option G: Ensuring all employees understand monitoring procedures. This might be more about training or awareness, but is it a monitoring step? Or is it part of the foundation? I'm not sure.

Option H: Assessing and reporting results, including follow-up. Absolutely, monitoring would involve evaluating results and taking corrective actions.

Option I: Automating procedures as much as possible. Automation can make monitoring more efficient and reliable, so this is probably a step.

Now, the question is which one is NOT part of the approach. Let me think about each option again.

The question is about the "steps" involved in the monitoring approach. So each option is a step except one.

Option A says increasing reliability and compliance. That sounds more like an objective rather than a specific step. The other options are actions taken (like designing, implementing, assessing), whereas A is more of an outcome or goal.

Wait, but COSO's monitoring approach is about how to monitor, not the goals. So the steps would include things like establishing a foundation, designing procedures, assessing results, etc.

So option A is about the outcome of effective monitoring, not a step in the process itself. So the answer would be A.

But wait, let me double-check. COSO's monitoring components include:

1. Establishing a foundation (F).
2. Designing procedures based on risk (E).
3. Conducting ongoing and/or separate evaluations (which might include surprise audits, C).
4. Assessing and reporting (H).
5. Updating procedures as needed (B).
6. Automating (I) could be part of efficient procedures.
7. Whistleblower system (D) supports monitoring by allowing issues to be reported.

Option G says ensuring all employees understand the procedures. I'm not sure if that's a separate step or part of the foundation. Maybe it's part of training but not a specific step in the monitoring approach.

Wait, the question is which is NOT a step. So if G is about understanding, which is more about communication rather than a step in monitoring, perhaps it's the exception. Alternatively, if the steps include ensuring understanding, then G is part of it.

Alternatively, maybe option A is the correct answer because it's about the purpose, not a step. So I'm a bit torn between A and G.

Wait, COSO's monitoring approach includes the following key elements:

- Ongoing monitoring activities built into business processes.
- Separate evaluations (like audits).
- Reporting and follow-up.

The steps would involve designing these activities, assessing, reporting, etc.

Increasing reliability is the objective, not a step. So option A is not a step but a goal.

So the correct answer is A.

According to COSO, an effective approach to monitoring internal control involves specific steps to ensure the system operates effectively. The question asks which option is NOT one of these steps. 

- **Option A**: Increasing the reliability of financial reporting and compliance with laws is more of an objective or outcome of effective monitoring rather than a specific step in the process. 
- **Option B**: Regularly updating monitoring procedures as business changes is a necessary step to adapt to evolving conditions.
- **Option C**: Conducting surprise audits is a common method to ensure compliance and effectiveness.
- **Option D**: Implementing a whistle-blowing system supports monitoring by allowing issues to be reported.
- **Option E**: Designing procedures based on risks aligns with COSO's emphasis on risk assessment.
- **Option F**: Establishing a foundation for monitoring is a fundamental starting point.
- **Option G**: Ensuring all employees understand monitoring procedures could be part of training or communication but may not be a specific step in the monitoring process itself.
- **Option H**: Assessing and reporting results, including follow-up, is a critical step.
- **Option I**: Automating procedures improves efficiency and reliability, making it a likely step.

While Option G could be debated, Option A clearly represents an outcome rather than a specific step in the monitoring process. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A**
