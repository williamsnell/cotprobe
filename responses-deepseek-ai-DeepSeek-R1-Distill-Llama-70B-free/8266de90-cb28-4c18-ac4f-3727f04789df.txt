Okay, so I've got this question about Robertsonian translocation, and I need to figure it out. Hmm, I remember that Robertsonian translocation has something to do with chromosomes fusing together. Let me think.

Robertsonian translocation is a type of chromosomal abnormality where two chromosomes join at a specific point. I think it's when the ends of two acrocentric chromosomes fuse. Wait, acrocentric chromosomes have their centromeres near the ends, right? So the short arms are very small.

So in a Robertsonian translocation, two of these acrocentric chromosomes lose their short arms and fuse at the centromere. Oh wait, no, maybe they fuse somewhere else. Or wait, no, I think the fusion happens at the point where the breaks occur. Since acrocentric chromosomes have their centromeres near the end, the break must be near the centromere.

Wait, the question is asking where the fusion occurs. I remember that in Robertsonian translocation, the long arms are the parts that are retained. So the two long arms from each chromosome are joined together, and the short arms are lost or discarded. That means the fusion point must be at the ends of the long arms. Or wait, no, maybe it's the other way around.

Wait, the ends of the short arms? Because the short arms are the parts that are near the centromere. If two chromosomes break near their centromeres (on the short arms), then the long arms would be the parts that are saved. So the fusion would occur where the breaks happened, which is near the short arms' ends. So the fusion is at the ends of the short arms.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Acrocentric chromosomes have their centromere near the end. So the short arm is tiny. If a break occurs just below the centromere, the part beyond is the short arm, right? So when two such chromosomes break, the broken ends (the short arms) are lost, and the remaining parts (the long arms and the centromere regions) fuse together. So the fusion must occur at the point where the breaks were, which is at the ends of the short arms.

So the options are A: ends of long arms, B: ends of short arms. I think it's B.

Alternatively, I've heard that Robertsonian translocation involves the loss of the short arms and the joining of the long arms. So the fusion is at the point where the short arms were connected, which would be near the centromere. Wait, no, because the centromere is in the middle of the chromosome. Or wait, in acrocentric chromosomes, the centromere is near the top, so the short arm is very small. So the break must be in the short arm, near the centromere. So the fusion is at the ends of the short arms.

So the correct answer should be B: ends of the short arms.

In a Robertsonian translocation, two acrocentric chromosomes fuse together, resulting in the loss of their short arms. Acrocentric chromosomes have their centromeres located near the ends, making the short arms very small. The fusion occurs at the breaks near the ends of the short arms, as these are the regions that are lost. The long arms of the chromosomes are retained and joined together. Therefore, the fusion takes place at the ends of the short arms.

Answer: B
