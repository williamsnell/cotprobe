Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem here about a block of copper undergoing a process. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll take it slow.

The problem says: A block of copper is initially at 1 atm and 520°R. Then the pressure is increased to 1000 atm in a reversible isothermal process. I need to find four things: change in internal energy, change in entropy, heat absorbed, and work done, all per unit mass.

Wait, the process is isothermal, so the temperature remains constant. Oh right, for an isothermal process, the internal energy change for an ideal gas is zero because ΔU depends only on temperature. But wait, copper is a solid, not a gas. Hmm, solids can be approximated as incompressible sometimes, or maybe they use something else.

But wait, the problem mentions it's a reversible isothermal process. I'm trying to remember if for solids, the internal energy change is significant when pressure changes, but I'm not sure. Let's think about the properties of solids. Solids have a small compressibility, so when pressure increases, the volume changes a little. But for a solid like copper, I might approximate it as having a constant specific volume. Alternatively, maybe the problem treats copper as a constant volume substance, but I'm not certain.

Wait, but the process is isothermal. For an ideal gas, isothermal means ΔU=0 and ΔH=0 because H is a function of temperature. But for solids, maybe it's different. Alternatively, maybe the problem assumes that copper behaves like an ideal gas, but that doesn't make much sense because gases and solids are different.

Wait, but the problem gives pressures in atm, which is more of a gas unit. Maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about each part.

a) Change in internal energy (Δu): For an isothermal process, if the substance is an ideal gas, ΔU would be zero because internal energy depends only on temperature. But copper isn't a gas. However, for solids, internal energy is primarily a function of temperature, not pressure. So if temperature doesn't change, maybe Δu is zero. That would make sense. So part (a) should be zero.

b) Change in entropy (Δs): Entropy change for an isothermal process is given by Δs = nR ln(V2/V1) for an ideal gas. But again, copper isn't a gas. Alternatively, entropy change for a solid under pressure at constant temperature... Hmm, the formula might be Δs = - (∂V/∂P)_T * (P2 - P1) / T, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the entropy change is considered zero because the process is isothermal and the volume change is negligible. Or perhaps the process is considered reversible, so the entropy change is calculated using heat transfer. Since it's isothermal, Q = W, and ΔS = Q_rev/T.

Wait, but for a solid, maybe entropy change is negligible because the volume change is small. Alternatively, since T is constant, maybe the entropy change is calculated using the relation ΔS = nCv ln(T2/T1) + nR ln(V2/V1), but since T doesn't change, the first term is zero. So ΔS would be nR ln(V2/V1). But without knowing how V changes with pressure, maybe we can't compute it.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that for a solid, the entropy change is negligible, so Δs is zero. Or maybe they model it as an incompressible substance, so V doesn't change, so Δs = 0. But I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Hmm, maybe I should think about the given options. Looking at the options, option D has all zeros, but let me check the others. Option A has non-zero values. For part (a), if Δu is zero, then looking at the options, option D and maybe others have (a) as zero. Wait, looking at the options:

Option D: a) 0, b) 0, c)0, d)0.

Wait, but the process is isothermal, so for an ideal gas, work done would be PΔV, but for a solid, maybe work is PΔV, but if the volume change is small, the work might be negligible. Alternatively, if the volume is considered constant, then work done is zero (since W = PΔV, ΔV=0). But the process is reversible and isothermal, so for an ideal gas, W = nRT ln(V1/V2). But if copper's volume doesn't change much, maybe W is approximately zero. So for part (d), the work done would be zero. Then, since Q = W (for isothermal ideal gas), Q would be zero. And since ΔU is zero, that would make sense.

But wait, the problem is about copper, so perhaps the process is considered as constant volume. Because for a solid, the volume change with pressure is minimal. So if the process is isothermal and at constant volume, then:

ΔU = 0 (since temperature doesn't change, and U is a function of T only for solids)

Work done W = PΔV. But ΔV is zero, so W=0.

Heat transfer Q would be equal to W, so Q=0.

Entropy change ΔS = Q_rev / T = 0/T = 0.

So all four parts would be zero. Looking at the options, option D is (a)0, (b)0, (c)0, (d)0.

Wait, but let me think again. If the process is not at constant volume, but the volume change is very small, then the work would be small but not exactly zero. But if the problem assumes constant volume, then the work is zero. Is there any other consideration?

Alternatively, maybe the problem models copper as an ideal gas, which I don't think is correct, but perhaps that's what's intended.

Wait, let me think again. For a reversible isothermal process for an ideal gas:

ΔU = 0 (isothermal)

ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1)

But without knowing specific volume or mass, maybe the problem is using specific properties. Wait, the problem is per unit mass, so perhaps specific entropy change is considered.

Wait, but the problem gives initial and final pressures. For an ideal gas, since temperature is constant, P1V1 = P2V2, so V2 = V1*(P1/P2). So V decreases as pressure increases.

But for a solid, the relation between P and V is not as straightforward. Solids have a bulk modulus, K, defined as K = -V (dP)/(dV) at constant T. So dV = -V dP / K.

So, the change in volume would be ΔV = V (P2 - P1) / K.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give the bulk modulus for copper, so maybe we can't compute the exact value. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the volume change is negligible, so the work done and heat transfer are negligible, making all the changes zero.

But looking at the options, option D is all zeros. So perhaps that's the intended answer.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about each part:

a) Δu = 0 because temperature doesn't change, and for solids, U depends mainly on T.

b) Δs: Since the process is reversible and isothermal, the entropy change would be the heat transferred divided by T. But since Q = W, and if the volume change is negligible, W is small, so Q is small, leading Δs to be small.

Wait, but the problem might be considering the process as isothermal compression, so for an ideal gas, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, if we model the copper as an ideal gas, which it's not, but perhaps the problem expects that. Then:

For an ideal gas, isothermal process:

ΔU = 0 (so a) 0.

ΔS = m R ln(P1/P2) [since for ideal gas, S = mf(g(T)) + mR ln(P_ref / P) ... Wait, no, the entropy change for ideal gas in isothermal process is ΔS = m R ln(V2/V1) = m R ln(P1/P2).

Wait, but per unit mass, so specific entropy change s2 - s1 = R ln(P1/P2). Because for ideal gas, s = c_p ln(T/T_ref) - R ln(P/P_ref). So at constant T, the change is -R ln(P2/P1) = R ln(P1/P2).

But wait, if the process is compression, P increases, so P2 > P1, so ln(P1/P2) is negative. So Δs would be negative.

Looking at the options, for part (b), the values are positive in options A, B, etc. Hmm.

Wait, but if the process is isothermal and reversible, then for an ideal gas, the entropy change is positive because the system is doing work and absorbing heat. Wait, no, when you compress a gas isothermally, the entropy decreases because the volume decreases. So the system's entropy decreases.

Wait, let me think again. For an ideal gas, when compressed isothermally, the volume decreases, so the entropy change is negative because fewer microstates are available.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about each part.

If I model copper as an ideal gas for the sake of solving the problem, then:

a) Δu = 0, because isothermal.

b) Δs = (mass)(R) ln(V2/V1) = m R ln(P1/P2).

Wait, but the units here are per unit mass, so specific entropy change would be (R/MW) ln(P1/P2), where MW is molar mass.

But wait, copper's molar mass is about 63.55 g/mol, so 0.06355 kg/mol. But I'm not sure if I need that.

Wait, but without knowing specific volume or mass, perhaps the problem is intended to model the copper as an ideal gas.

Wait, but the options don't have (a) as zero except option D. So maybe the correct answer is D, with all zeros.

But wait, another approach: for a solid, the internal energy is a function of temperature only, so if T is constant, Δu=0. For entropy, the change is given by T dS = dQ_rev. Since it's isothermal and reversible, dQ = T dS. But for a solid, the heat transfer is dQ = T dS = (dU + P dV). But since dU=0, dQ = T dS = P dV.

So dS = (P dV)/T.

But to find the total entropy change, we need to integrate from initial to final states. So:

ΔS = ∫ (P dV)/T from V1 to V2.

But without knowing how V changes with P, I can't compute this. However, if the process is considered as V = constant (incompressible), then ΔV=0, so ΔS=0.

Alternatively, if we model the solid as having a constant specific volume v, then Δv=0, so work done W = PΔv = 0, and since Q=W, Q=0, and ΔU=0.

In that case, all four quantities (Δu, Δs, Q, W) would be zero per unit mass.

Looking at the options, option D has all zeros.

So perhaps the correct answer is D.

The problem involves a block of copper undergoing a reversible isothermal process where the pressure increases from 1 atm to 1000 atm at a constant temperature of 520°R. The goal is to determine the changes in internal energy, entropy, heat absorbed, and work done per unit mass.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Change in Internal Energy (Δu):**  
   For an isothermal process, the internal energy of an ideal gas depends only on temperature, so Δu = 0. For solids like copper, internal energy is also primarily a function of temperature. Since the temperature remains constant, Δu = 0.

2. **Change in Entropy (Δs):**  
   For an ideal gas, entropy change during an isothermal process is given by:  
   \[
   \Delta s = mR \ln\left(\frac{P_1}{P_2}\right)
   \]  
   However, copper is a solid, and its entropy change is negligible due to minimal volume change under pressure. If the volume is approximated as constant, Δs = 0.

3. **Heat Absorbed (Q):**  
   For an isothermal process, heat transfer (Q) is equal to the work done (W). If the volume is constant, no work is done (W = PΔV = 0), and thus Q = 0.

4. **Work Done (W):**  
   Work done is given by \( W = P\Delta V \). For a solid like copper, the volume change under pressure is negligible, so ΔV ≈ 0, and W = 0.

### Conclusion:
Since the process is isothermal and copper is treated as an incompressible solid, all four quantities—change in internal energy, entropy, heat absorbed, and work done—are zero per unit mass. This aligns with **Option D**.
