Question:

What prevents the stomach from being digested by itsown secretions?

Options:

A: The stomach has a high permeability to hydrogen ions
B: The presence of beneficial bacteria that neutralize stomach acid
C: The stomach lining is replaced every month
D: The stomach lining secretes digestive enzymes only when food is present
E: The production of bile in the stomach neutralizes the digestive acids
F: A thick layer of muscle tissue that is resistant to digestive enzymes and acids
G: The stomach is protected by a layer of fat
H: The mucus layer, the permeability of the membranes and the continual replacement of the cells comprising the lining all help protect the stomach from being digested by its own secretions.
I: The stomach secretes a special hormone that prevents digestion of its own tissues
J: The stomach contents are too acidic for the enzymes to function properly

Okay, so I've got this question about why the stomach doesn't get digested by its own secretions. Hmm, I remember learning a bit about the digestive system in biology class. Let me think through this.

The stomach is full of acids and enzymes like pepsin, right? Those help break down food, but they're pretty harsh. So why don't they eat away the stomach lining itself? I think it's something to do with the lining of the stomach being protected somehow.

Wait, I remember something about mucus. The stomach lining produces mucus to protect itself. That makes sense because mucus is a thick, protective layer. But is that the only reason? Or are there other factors too?

Oh right, I think the cells in the stomach lining are also rapidly replaced. Like, they have a high turnover rate because the environment is so harsh. So if any of the cells do get damaged, they can quickly be replaced. Also, the way the stomach lining is structured probably plays a role. Maybe the cells are tightly packed to prevent the acid from seeping through.

Looking at the options now. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: High permeability to hydrogen ions. I'm not sure. Permeability might relate, but high permeability would mean H+ ions can pass through easily, which doesn't sound protective. Maybe it's the opposite, low permeability, but I don't think that's the main factor.

Option B: Beneficial bacteria neutralizing acid. I haven't heard that. The stomach is pretty acidic, so I don't think many bacteria live there. Plus, that's more about the small intestine maybe, with gut flora.

Option C: Stomach lining replaced every month. I think the replacement is more frequent than monthly, like maybe every few days, because the stomach is such a harsh environment. So this might not be the complete answer, but it's part of it.

Option D: Enzymes secreted only when food is present. Well, I think some digestive enzymes are released in response to food, but the stomach always has some acid and maybe some enzymes present. Plus, even when food isn't there, the stomach might still have some secretions, especially when empty.

Option E: Bile neutralizes acid in the stomach. Wait, bile is produced in the liver and stored in the gallbladder. It's released into the small intestine to emulsify fats. The stomach itself doesn't produce bile, so this doesn't make sense. The stomach uses acid, and the small intestine is where bile works. So E is probably wrong.

Option F: Thick muscle layer resistant. I don't think the stomach's main protection is muscle. The stomach has muscular walls for churning food, but the lining's protection is more about mucus and cell replacement, not muscle.

Option G: Protected by a fat layer. That doesn't sound right. I don't recall any fat layer around the stomach lining. Maybe in other organs, but not the stomach.

Option H: Mucus, permeability, and cell replacement. Oh, this sounds familiar. The mucus layer would physically protect the lining. The cell membranes might have low permeability to acid, preventing it from penetrating. And the quick replacement of cells ensures that any damage is rapidly fixed. So this combines multiple factors.

Option I: Hormone that prevents digestion. I don't remember any such hormone. The stomach does produce hormones like gastrin to stimulate acid secretion, but nothing that stops self-digestion. So I doubt this is correct.

Option J: Stomach too acidic for enzymes. Wait, no. The digestive enzymes in the stomach, like pepsin, work best in acidic conditions. So if the stomach were too acidic, the enzymes wouldn't function. But actually, the stomach's acidity is just right for them. So this is the opposite of what's true, making this option incorrect.

So putting it all together, the correct answer must be H. It combines the mucus barrier, the cell membrane's selective permeability, and the rapid cell turnover. All these factors work together to prevent the stomach from being digested by its own juices.

The stomach is protected from being digested by its own secretions through a combination of mechanisms. First, a thick mucus layer acts as a physical barrier, preventing acidic digestive juices and enzymes from coming into contact with the stomach lining. Additionally, the stomach lining is composed of tightly packed epithelial cells with low permeability to hydrogen ions, further preventing acid penetration. Lastly, the stomach lining cells are continually replaced due to the harsh conditions, ensuring that any damaged cells are quickly regenerated. This multi-layered defense system effectively protects the stomach from self-digestion.

Option H correctly identifies all these factors: the mucus layer, the permeability of the cell membranes, and the continual replacement of the cells comprising the lining.

Answer: H
