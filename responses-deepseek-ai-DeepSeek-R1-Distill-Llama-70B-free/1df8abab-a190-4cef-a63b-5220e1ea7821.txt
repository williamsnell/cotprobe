Question:

A newspaper printed an article stating that a local doctor was afflicted with a venereal disease and had volunteered for a program studying the various cures for the disease. The article was false, and was printed without adequate research. The doctor sued the newspaper company, claiming damages per se. The paper defended on the basis that this was a public interest article, that the paper was not reckless or malicious in its investigation and reporting, and that the doctor could not prove any special damages. Will the court adopt the defense reasoning and dismiss the case for failure to state a claim?

Options:

A: No, this fits the requirements for slander per se and there is a valid claim of malice stated against the paper.
B: Yes, the newspaper's actions are protected by freedom of the press, and the doctor cannot prove malice.
C: No, this fits the requirements for libel per se, which is so inflammatory that the doctor does not have to prove special damages.
D: No, the newspaper's actions caused harm to the doctor's reputation, which is enough to sustain a claim, regardless of proven special damages.
E: Yes, the doctor is a professional figure in the community and he must accept the risk of false reporting, especially where he cannot prove any special damages.
F: No, the newspaper acted negligently in its reporting, which is enough to sustain a libel claim.
G: Yes, the newspaper is allowed to make mistakes as long as there is no malice, and the case must be dismissed as a matter of law.
H: Yes, the doctor is a public figure, and the newspaper had no intention of harming his reputation.
I: Yes, the newspaper's defense of public interest is valid, and the doctor cannot prove any special damages.
J: No, the doctor has a valid claim for defamation per se, and the newspaper's defense is invalid.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about defamation. Let's break it down step by step. The situation is a newspaper published a false article about a local doctor having a venereal disease and volunteering for a cure study. The doctor is suing for damages per se, and the newspaper is defending with certain arguments. I need to determine if the court will dismiss the case based on the newspaper's defense.

First, I remember that defamation can be either slander or libel. Slander is spoken, libel is written. Since it's a newspaper article, this is libel. Now, libel per se means that the statement is so obviously harmful that the plaintiff doesn't have to prove special damages; general damages are assumed. Examples usually include things like accusing someone of a crime of moral turpitude, having a loathsome disease, or affecting someone's professional reputation.

In this case, the article falsely claims the doctor has a venereal disease. Venereal diseases are typically considered loathsome, so this might qualify as libel per se. That would mean the doctor doesn't have to show special damages, like specific monetary losses.

The newspaper's defenses are that it was a public interest article, they weren't reckless or malicious, and the doctor can't prove special damages. But wait, if it's libel per se, the special damages part doesn't matter. So the lack of proof on special damages wouldn't necessarily help the newspaper.

Next, the issue of malice. In defamation cases, especially when it comes to public figures, the plaintiff usually has to prove that the defendant acted with actual malice, meaning knowing it was false or with reckless disregard for the truth. But here, the doctor is a local professional, not necessarily a public figure. Public figures are typically those in the public eye, like politicians, celebrities, etc. A local doctor might not be considered a public figure unless they're actively seeking public attention.

So if the doctor isn't a public figure, the standard might be negligence instead of malice. The newspaper's defense says they weren't reckless or malicious. If the standard is negligence, then their lack of recklessness could be a defense. But wait, if it's libel per se, sometimes the standard is different. Some jurisdictions might require at least negligence for libel per se, but I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Alternatively, some cases hold that libel per se doesn't require proof of actual damages, but the plaintiff still has to prove that the defendant was at least negligent in publishing the statement. The newspaper here claims they weren't reckless or malicious, but does that mean they were negligent?

Wait, the question states the article was printed without adequate research, which could imply negligence. So if the newspaper didn't do their due diligence, that's negligence. If the standard in this case is negligence, then the newspaper's lack of recklessness or malice might not be enough. Because negligence is a lower standard than recklessness.

Putting it together: the statement is libel per se because it's about a loathsome disease, so the doctor doesn't need to prove special damages. The newspaper's defense that they weren't reckless or malicious might not matter because if the standard is negligence, and they were negligent (by not doing adequate research), then they can be held liable. So the court might not adopt the newspaper's defense and allow the case to proceed.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option C says it's libel per se, so no need to prove special damages. Option F says the newspaper acted negligently, which is enough. Option J says the doctor has a valid claim and the defense is invalid.

Wait, but if the newspaper's defense includes that they weren't reckless or malicious, but were they negligent? The question says the article was printed without adequate research, which implies negligence. So the newspaper's defense is that they weren't reckless, but they might still be guilty of negligence, which is enough for libel per se.

So the correct answer would be that the court doesn't adopt the defense and allows the claim. So looking at the options, option C says it's libel per se and no special damages needed. Option F says negligence is enough. Option J says the claim is valid.

Wait, but the question is whether the court adopts the defense reasoning and dismisses the case. So if the defense is that they weren't reckless and the doctor can't prove special damages, but the claim is libel per se, then the defense fails because no special damages are needed, and if they were negligent, that's enough.

So the answer would be that the court does not dismiss the case. So looking at the options, option C says no, it's libel per se, so the claim is valid. Option J also says no, the doctor has a valid claim.

Wait, the options. Option C says: No, this fits libel per se, so doctor doesn't have to prove special damages. That seems correct because libel per se doesn't require special damages.

So I think the correct answer is C.

The case involves a newspaper publishing a false article about a local doctor having a venereal disease, which qualifies as libel since it is written. Venereal diseases are considered loathsome, making this libel per se. Libel per se is so inherently harmful that the plaintiff does not need to prove special damages, as general damages are assumed. 

The newspaper defends by stating the article was in the public interest, they were not reckless or malicious, and the doctor cannot prove special damages. However, since this is libel per se, the inability to prove special damages is irrelevant. The key issue is whether the newspaper acted negligently. The article was printed without adequate research, indicating negligence, which is sufficient for liability in libel per se. 

Thus, the court will not adopt the newspaper's defense and will allow the case to proceed. The correct answer is that the doctor has a valid claim for libel per se, and the newspaper's defense is invalid.
