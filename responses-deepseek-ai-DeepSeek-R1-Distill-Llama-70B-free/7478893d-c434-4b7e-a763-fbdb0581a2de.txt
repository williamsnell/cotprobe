Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about radioactive decay and electrostatic force. Hmm, let me try to work through it step by step. Alright, the question is about the decay of Uranium-238 into Thorium-234 and an alpha particle, which is a helium nucleus. The problem gives me the separation distance between them and asks for the magnitude of the electrostatic force.

Wait, so the Uranium nucleus is decaying, right? So U-238 becomes Th-234 plus He-4. Both Th and He are nuclei here, so they're just charged particles, no electrons involved. So I need to find the electrostatic force between them when they're 9.0e-15 meters apart.

I remember that the electrostatic force can be calculated using Coulomb's law. Coulomb's law is F = k * |q1*q2| / r². So I need to find the charges of Th-234 and He-4.

Let me think about the charges. Uranium-238 has a charge of +92e because its atomic number is 92. When it decays, it emits an alpha particle, which is He-4. The helium nucleus has a charge of +2e because helium's atomic number is 2. So the Thorium-234 nucleus must have a charge that's the remaining, right? Because the charges have to balance.

So U-238 (charge +92e) decays into Th-234 and He-4. The Th-234 nucleus must have a charge of +92e - (+2e) = +90e. So Th is +90e and He is +2e. So the two charges are Q1 = +90e and Q2 = +2e.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure. Because in beta decay, charges can change, but in alpha decay, the parent emits an alpha particle. So the daughter nucleus would have a charge two less than the parent. So U has charge 92, so Th (the daughter) should have 92 - 2 = 90. So yes, +90e and +2e.

So now I can plug these into Coulomb's law. Let me jot down the knowns:

q1 = 90e
q2 = 2e
r = 9e-15 m

I know Coulomb's constant k is approximately 8.988e9 N·m²/C², but sometimes rounded to 9e9 for calculations. But maybe I should use the exact value for accuracy.

Wait, what's the value of e? The elementary charge is 1.602e-19 coulombs. So each charge is multiplied by that.

So let's compute the product of the charges first. q1*q2 = (90e) * (2e) = 180 * e².

Wait, no, because 90e is 90 times the elementary charge, which is 90 * 1.6e-19 C. So let me compute 90 * 1.6e-19 and 2 * 1.6e-19.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute 90 * 2 = 180, then multiply by (e)^2. Since e is 1.6e-19, e squared is (1.6e-19)^2.

So let's calculate that. (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38 C².

So q1*q2 = 180 * 2.56e-38 = let's see, 180 * 2.56 is... 180 * 2 is 360, 180 * 0.56 is 100.8, so total 460.8. So 460.8e-38 C². Wait, no, because 180 times 2.56e-38 is 4.608e-36 C²? Wait, wait. Let me compute exponents correctly. 180 * 2.56e-38 = 180 * 2.56 * 1e-38.

180 * 2.56: 180 * 2 = 360, 180 * 0.56 = 100.8, so sum is 460.8. So 460.8e-38 C². Oh wait, 460.8e-38 is the same as 4.608e-36 C². Because 460.8 is 4.608 x 10^2, so 4.608e2 * 1e-38 = 4.608e-36.

So the product of the charges is 4.608e-36 C².

Now, Coulomb's law is F = k * (q1 q2) / r².

So k is 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

r is 9e-15 m, so r squared is (9e-15)^2 = 81e-30 m², which is 8.1e-29 m²? Wait, (9e-15)^2 = 81e-30, which is the same as 8.1e-29. Because 81e-30 is 8.1 * 10^1 * 1e-30 = 8.1e-29.

So putting it all into F: F = (8.988e9) * (4.608e-36) / (8.1e-29).

Let me compute the numerator first: 8.988e9 * 4.608e-36.

Multiplying 8.988 * 4.608. Let me approximate: 8.988 is about 9, 4.608 is about 4.6, so 9*4.6=41.4. But more accurately:

8.988 * 4.608.

Let me compute 8 * 4.608 = 36.864.

0.988 * 4.608: Let's compute 1 * 4.608 = 4.608, subtract 0.012 *4.608=0.0553. So 4.608 - 0.0553 = 4.5527.

So total is 36.864 +4.5527=41.4167.

So 8.988 *4.608 ≈ 41.4167.

So 41.4167e(9 + (-36)) = 41.4167e-27.

Wait, 8.988e9 *4.608e-36 = (8.988 *4.608) * 1e9 * 1e-36 = 41.4167 * 1e-27 = 4.14167e-26.

Wait, 9*1e9 is 1e9, 4.6e-36 is 4.6e-36. So 1e9 *4.6e-36 = 4.6e-27. But when you multiply them, 8.988e9 *4.608e-36 = (8.988 *4.608) * 1e9 * 1e-36.

Wait, 1e9 *1e-36 is 1e-27. So yes, 8.988e9 *4.608e-36 = 41.4167e-27, which is 4.14167e-26.

Then, the denominator is r² = 8.1e-29 m².

So F = (4.14167e-26) / (8.1e-29) ) 

Dividing exponents: 1e-26 /1e-29 = 1e3.

So 4.14167e-26 /8.1e-29 = (4.14167 /8.1 ) * 1e3.

Compute 4.14167 /8.1.

Well, 8.1 goes into 4.14 about 0.512 times. Let me compute:

8.1 * 0.5 =4.05. So 0.5 gives 4.05. The remainder is 4.14167 -4.05=0.09167.

So 0.09167 /8.1 = approximately 0.0113.

So total is 0.5 + 0.0113 = 0.5113.

So 0.5113 * 1e3 = 511.3 N.

Wait, but wait a second, this is giving me around 511 N. But looking at the options, I don't see that. Let me check the options again. The options are A:5.1e2 N, which is 510 N. So that's about what I got. Option A is 5.1e2 N, which is 510 N. But let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere. Let me go back.

Wait, the charges: U-238 has atomic number 92, so charge +92e. After decay, Th-234 has atomic number 90 (92-2), so charge +90e. He-4 is +2e. So that's correct.

So q1*q2 = 90 * 2 * (e)^2 = 180 e².

e is 1.6e-19 C. So e squared is (1.6e-19)^2 = 2.56e-38 C². So 180 * 2.56e-38 = 4.608e-36 C². That's correct.

k is 8.988e9 N m²/C².

r is 9e-15 m, so r² is 8.1e-29 m².

So F = k * (q1 q2) / r² = (8.988e9) * (4.608e-36) / (8.1e-29).

Compute numerator: 8.988e9 *4.608e-36 = 8.988 *4.608 = approx 41.4167, and exponents 9 + (-36) = -27. So 41.4167e-27 = 4.14167e-26.

Divide by denominator 8.1e-29: 4.14167e-26 / 8.1e-29 = (4.14167 / 8.1) * 1e3.

4.14167 /8.1 is roughly 0.511, as before. So 0.511 * 1e3 = 511 N.

Looking at the options, option A is 5.1e2 N, which is 510 N. So that's very close. But wait, let me compute the division more accurately.

4.14167 /8.1 = let's compute more precisely.

8.1 * 0.5 =4.05, as before. Subtract 4.05 from 4.14167: 0.09167.

Now, 0.09167 /8.1 = 0.09167 /8.1.

Compute 8.1 into 0.09167: 8.1 * 0.0113= approx 0.09153. So 0.09167 -0.09153= 0.00014.

So 0.09167/8.1= approx 0.0113, as before.

So total is 0.5 +0.0113= 0.5113.

So 0.5113 * 1e3 =511.3 N.

Hmm, but the options don't have exactly 511 N. Let me check the options again.

Looking back, the options are:

A:5.1e2 N → 510 N

H:6.8e2 →680

J:7.7e2→770

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate the numbers more accurately.

Wait 8.988 *4.608 → let me compute this exactly.

8.988 *4.608:

Let me compute 8 *4.608 = 36.864.

0.988 *4.608: Let me compute 1 *4.608=4.608, subtract 0.012 *4.608=0.0553.

So 4.608 -0.0553=4.5527.

So 36.864 +4.5527=41.4167. So 8.988 *4.608=41.4167.

So 41.4167e-27 kg·m/s²·C²/(C²·m²) ? Wait, no, the units will take care of themselves.

So 41.4167e-27 N·m²/C² * C² = 4.14167e-26 N·m².

Wait, no, wait. Coulomb's law gives F in newtons when using SI units.

So F = (8.988e9 N·m²/C²) * (4.608e-36 C²) / (8.1e-29 m²).

Let me compute 8.988e9 *4.608e-36 first.

Multiply 8.988e9 by 4.608e-36: 8.988 *4.608 = 41.4167, exponents 9 + (-36) = -27 → 41.4167e-27.

Now, 41.4167e-27 /8.1e-29 = 41.4167 /8.1 * 1e2.

Wait wait, because 1e-27 /1e-29 = 1e2.

So (41.4167 /8.1 ) *1e2.

Compute 41.4167 /8.1.

41.4167 divided by 8.1:

8.1 *5=40.5 → 41.4167-40.5=0.9167.

0.9167/8.1≈0.1132.

So 5.1132.

So 5.1132 *1e2=511.32 N.

So approximately 511 N, which is 5.11e2 N, which is closest to option A (5.1e2 N). But wait, let me look at the options again.

Looking back, the options are:

A:5.1e2 →510 N

H:6.8e2 →680

J:7.7e2→770

Wait, but I'm getting 511 N, which is very close to 5.1e2. So option A is that.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponents somewhere. Let me recheck the calculation.

Wait, 8.988e9 *4.608e-36 = (8.988 *4.608) * (1e9 *1e-36) )= 41.4167 *1e-27 = 4.14167e-26.

Then divide by 8.1e-29 m²:

4.14167e-26 /8.1e-29 = (4.14167 /8.1) * (1e-26 /1e-29) )

1e-26 /1e-29 = 1e3.

So 4.14167 /8.1 = 0.5113, as before.

So 0.5113e3 →511.3 N.

So yes, 511 N. So the correct answer would be A, 5.1e2 N.

Wait, but let me think about the charges again. Uranium is U-238, and when it decays, it emits an alpha particle (He-4), so the daughter is Th-234.

The charge of U-238 is +92e, so the Th-234 has +90e, and the He-4 has +2e. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, so the product is 90 * 2 =180, yes. So that part is correct.

So the calculation seems right, leading to approximately 511 N, which is option A.

Looking at the options, A is 5.1e2 N, which is 510 N. That's very close. So I think the correct answer is A.

To calculate the electrostatic force between the ${ }^{234} \mathrm{Th}$ and ${ }^4 \mathrm{He}$ nuclei after the radioactive decay of ${ }^{238} \mathrm{U}$, we use Coulomb's law:

\[
F = k \cdot \frac{|q_1 \cdot q_2|}{r^2}
\]

### Step 1: Determine the charges
- The atomic number of uranium (\(U\)) is 92, so the charge of the \({ }^{238} \mathrm{U}\) nucleus is \(+92e\), where \(e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{C}\).
- After decay, the \({ }^{234} \mathrm{Th}\) nucleus has an atomic number of 90, so its charge is \(+90e\).
- The ejected \({ }^4 \mathrm{He}\) nucleus (alpha particle) has an atomic number of 2, so its charge is \(+2e\).

Thus, the charges are:
\[
q_1 = +90e, \quad q_2 = +2e
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the product of the charges
The product of the charges is:
\[
q_1 \cdot q_2 = (90e) \cdot (2e) = 180e^2
\]
Substituting \(e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{C}\):
\[
q_1 \cdot q_2 = 180 \cdot (1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 180 \cdot 2.566 \times 10^{-38} = 4.6128 \times 10^{-36} \, \mathrm{C}^2
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the separation distance squared
The separation distance is \(r = 9.0 \times 10^{-15} \, \mathrm{m}\), so:
\[
r^2 = (9.0 \times 10^{-15})^2 = 8.1 \times 10^{-29} \, \mathrm{m}^2
\]

### Step 4: Apply Coulomb's law
Coulomb's constant is \(k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \mathrm{N \cdot m^2 / C^2}\). Substituting into Coulomb's law:
\[
F = k \cdot \frac{|q_1 \cdot q_2|}{r^2}
\]
\[
F = (8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot \frac{4.6128 \times 10^{-36}}{8
