Question:

While on vacation, two friends went scuba diving in the ocean. Each of them was equipped with a spear gun, which they planned to use to kill tuna. As they were swimming, both men saw what appeared to be a large fin entangled in a nearby coral reef. Simultaneously, they shot their spear guns at the projecting wing-like figure. Unbeknownst to either of the friends, it was not a fish but rather another scuba diver. The victim was struck and slightly wounded by one of the spears. The victim asserts a claim for damages against the two friends. At trial, the judge should instruct the jury to rule

Options:

A: against both defendants jointly unless one of them proves that he did not shoot the spear that struck the victim.
B: against each defendant for one-half of the amount of damages, because they both acted independently and not jointly.
C: in favor of both defendants if no evidence is presented showing who actually shot the spear that injured the victim.
D: against each defendant for one-half of the amount of damages, because they both shot their spear guns simultaneously.
E: in favor of the victim, as both defendants acted recklessly in a situation that required caution.
F: against the defendant who cannot prove he did not shoot the spear, while the other defendant is exempt from damages.
G: against each defendant for one-third of the amount of damages, with the remaining one-third to be determined by the jury.
H: in favor of both defendants if the victim cannot prove beyond a reasonable doubt who shot the spear that injured him.
I: against both defendants for the full amount of damages, as they were both responsible for the situation.

Okay, so I've got this question about tort law, specifically dealing with joint liability in a situation where two people caused harm. Let me try to break it down step by step.

From what I remember, when two defendants act in a way that causes harm, but it's unclear who actually caused the specific injury, the concept of joint and several liability might come into play. I think this is often the case in products liability or when both parties are negligent.

In the scenario, two friends went scuba diving and saw what they thought was a tuna fin stuck in coral. They both shot their spear guns at the same time. But it turned out to be another diver, who was hit and injured by one of the spears. The victim is suing both for damages.

The key here is that each of them acted negligently. They both saw something they thought was prey and shot without perhaps ensuring it wasn't a person. So each of their actions could be considered negligent. But only one spear actually hit the victim. The problem is, no one knows which one did it.

In such cases, under tort law, when both defendants are negligent and their actions are independent but concurrent, leading to an indivisible injury, the doctrine of joint and several liability applies. This means each defendant can be held responsible for the entire harm. So the victim can recover full damages from either or both defendants, regardless of who actually caused the injury.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the jury should rule against both unless one proves they didn't shoot. That sounds like shifting the burden of proof. But in reality, once both are found negligent, they're both liable. The plaintiff doesn't need to prove which one did it because the injury is indivisible.

Option B and D suggest each pays half, which is incorrect because joint liability means each is responsible for the whole amount.

Option C says rule in favor of defendants if no evidence shows who shot. But that's not right; both are negligent, so the victim should win regardless.

Option E says rule for the victim because both acted recklessly. Well, the question is about negligence, not recklessness, but more importantly, the instruction should reflect the joint liability aspect, not just the fact that they acted recklessly.

Option F says only one is liable if they can't prove innocence. That's not correct because both should be liable regardless.

Option G splits it into thirds, which doesn't fit the joint liability principle.

Option H talks about proof beyond a reasonable doubt, which is a criminal standard, not civil. In civil cases, it's preponderance of evidence, so this option is wrong.

Option I says both are liable for the full amount. That aligns with joint and several liability. So the correct instruction would be that both are responsible for the full damages.

So the answer should be I.

The correct answer is based on the principle of joint and several liability in tort law. When two defendants act negligently, and their actions result in an indivisible injury, each defendant can be held responsible for the entire harm. Here, both friends acted negligently by shooting without verifying their target, and only one spear caused the injury. However, since the injury is indivisible and it's impossible to determine who caused it, both are liable for the full amount of damages. This means the victim can recover the entire damages from either or both defendants. 

The best answer is I.

I
