Question:

Consider a periodic signal $x(t)$ with period $(T)$ equals to ten. Over one period (i.e., $-5 \leq t<5)$, it is defined as $$ x(t)=\left\{\begin{array}{cc} 2 & -5 \leq t<0 \\ -2 & 0 \leq t<5 \end{array}\right. $$ In Fourier series, the signal $x(t)$ is written in the form of $$ x(t)=\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty} c_k e^{\frac{j 2 \pi k t}{T}} $$ where the Fourier series coefficient $c_k$ is obtained as, $$ c_k=\frac{1}{T} \int_{-\frac{T}{2}}^{\frac{T}{2}} x(t) e^{-\frac{j 2 \pi k t}{T}} d t $$ Determine the value of $c_0$ (i.e., $\left.k=0\right)$

Okay, so I have this Fourier series problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still new to this topic. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem says that we have a periodic signal x(t) with period T equal to ten. So, T is 10. The signal is defined over one period from -5 to 5, since the period is 10, right? Because -5 to 5 is a 10-second window.

The function x(t) is piecewise defined. From -5 ≤ t < 0, x(t) is 2. And from 0 ≤ t <5, it's -2. So it's a square wave that jumps from 2 to -2 at t=0, and repeats every 10 seconds.

The question is about finding the Fourier series coefficient c0 when k=0. The formula given is c_k = (1/T) times the integral from -T/2 to T/2 of x(t) multiplied by e^(-j2πkt/T) dt.

Since we're looking for c0, k is zero. Let me plug that into the formula. So, c0 becomes (1/10) times the integral from -5 to 5 (because T=10, so T/2 is 5) of x(t) multiplied by e^0, because when k=0, the exponential term is e^0 which is 1. So the equation simplifies to c0 = (1/10) times the integral of x(t) from -5 to 5.

So, the integral of x(t) over one period is just the area under the curve for x(t) in one period. Let's think about that. From -5 to 0, x(t) is 2. So the area for that part is 2 multiplied by the length of the interval. The interval from -5 to 0 is 5 seconds. So that's 2 *5 =10.

Then from 0 to5, x(t) is -2. The interval here is also 5 seconds. So the area is (-2)*5 = -10.

Adding these together: 10 + (-10) =0. So the integral from -5 to5 is 0. Then, c0 is (1/10)*0 =0.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Because I remember that the average value of a signal is given by c0. So in this case, the average value over one period would be zero, because the positive and negative areas cancel out. That makes sense, yes.

I think I got it right. So the answer should be 0, which is option E.

To determine the value of \( c_0 \) for the given periodic signal \( x(t) \), we use the formula for the Fourier series coefficient:

\[
c_k = \frac{1}{T} \int_{-\frac{T}{2}}^{\frac{T}{2}} x(t) e^{-\frac{j 2 \pi k t}{T}} dt
\]

For \( k = 0 \), the exponential term simplifies to 1, so:

\[
c_0 = \frac{1}{T} \int_{-\frac{T}{2}}^{\frac{T}{2}} x(t) dt
\]

Here, \( T = 10 \), and the integration interval is \( -5 \leq t < 5 \). The signal \( x(t) \) is defined as:

\[
x(t) = \begin{cases} 
2 & \text{if } -5 \leq t < 0, \\
-2 & \text{if } 0 \leq t < 5.
\end{cases}
\]

The integral of \( x(t) \) over one period is the sum of the areas under the curve in each interval:

1. From \( -5 \leq t < 0 \), \( x(t) = 2 \), so the area is \( 2 \cdot 5 = 10 \).
2. From \( 0 \leq t < 5 \), \( x(t) = -2 \), so the area is \( -2 \cdot 5 = -10 \).

Adding these together:

\[
\int_{-5}^{5} x(t) dt = 10 + (-10) = 0
\]

Thus, \( c_0 = \frac{1}{10} \cdot 0 = 0 \).

The average value of the signal over one period is zero, which confirms that \( c_0 = 0 \).
