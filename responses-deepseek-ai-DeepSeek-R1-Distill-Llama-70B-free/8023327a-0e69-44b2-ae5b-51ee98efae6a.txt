Okay, so I've got this problem here about a cannonball's height over time, right? The function given is h(t) = -4.9t² +14t -0.4. The question is asking for how long the cannonball is above a height of 6 meters. And the answer needs to be an improper fraction. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

Alright, I remember that when dealing with the time an object is above a certain height, it's about solving where h(t) equals that height. So in this case, I need to find the times when h(t) = 6. Once I find those times, the duration will be the difference between the two times.

So first, I'll set h(t) equal to 6 and solve for t. Let me write that out:

-4.9t² +14t -0.4 = 6

Wait, I should probably subtract 6 from both sides to set it to zero, right? So:

-4.9t² +14t -0.4 -6 = 0
Which simplifies to:
-4.9t² +14t -6.4 = 0

Hmm, dealing with decimals might be a bit tricky. Maybe I can eliminate the decimals by multiplying the entire equation by 10 to make the numbers easier. Let's try that:

Multiply each term by 10:
-49t² +140t -64 = 0

Okay, that's better. Now I have a quadratic equation: -49t² +140t -64 = 0. Solving for t will give me the times when the cannonball is at 6 meters.

Wait, I could also multiply both sides by -1 to make the quadratic coefficient positive, but I'm not sure if that's necessary. Maybe it's easier to use the quadratic formula as it is.

The quadratic formula is t = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)]/(2a). So in this equation, a is -49, b is 140, and c is -64.

Let me compute the discriminant first: b² -4ac.

b² is 140 squared. 140 *140 is 19600. 

Then, 4ac is 4*(-49)*(-64). Let's compute that: 4*49 is 196, 196*64. Wait, 200*64 is 12800, so 196 is 4 less than 200. So 4*64=256, so 196*64 = (200-4)*64 = 12800 - 256= 12544. So 4ac is 12544.

Wait, because a is -49 and c is -64, so 4ac is 4*(-49)(-64) = positive 12544.

So the discriminant is 19600 + 12544 = 32144.

Wait, wait no. Because the formula is b² -4ac. Here, a is -49, c is -64. So 4ac is 4*(-49)*(-64) which is positive 12544. So discriminant is 140² -4ac = 19600 - (4ac). Wait, no, wait: 4ac is positive 12544, so the discriminant is 19600 - (4ac) = 19600 - 12544? Wait, no, the formula is b² -4ac. So if 4ac is positive, then it's 19600 - (positive 12544) which is 19600-12544.

Wait, 19600 minus 12544. Let me compute that: 19600 -12000=7600, then subtract 544 more: 7600-544=7056. Oh, wait 544 from 7600: 7600-500=7100, 7100-44=7056. So discriminant is 7056.

Wait, that can't be right. Because 140 squared is 19600, and 4ac was 12544, so 19600 -12544 is 7056. Yeah.

Now, sqrt(7056). Hmm, what's the square root of 7056? Let me think. 84 squared is 7056 because 80² is 6400, 85² is 7225. 84^2: 80^2=6400, 4^2=16, 2*80*4=640. So (80+4)^2= 6400 + 640 +16=7056. So sqrt(7056)=84.

So now, the solutions are t = [-b ± sqrt(D)]/(2a). So substituting the values:

a=-49, b=140.

So:

t = [-140 ±84 ]/(2*(-49)).

Let me compute numerator first.

First solution: -140 +84 = -56.

Second solution: -140 -84= -224.

Denominator is 2*(-49)= -98.

So first solution: (-56)/(-98) = 56/98.

Simplify that: both divided by 14. 56/14=4; 98/14=7. So 4/7.

Second solution: (-224)/(-98) = 224/98.

Simplify: 224 divided by 14 is 16; 98 divided by14 is7. So 16/7.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because 224 ÷14 is 16, yes. 98 ÷14 is 7, yes.

So the two times are t=4/7 and t=16/7 seconds.

Wait, but wait, time can't be negative, so both these solutions are positive, which makes sense.

So the cannonball is at 6 meters height at t=4/7 seconds and t=16/7 seconds.

The question is asking for how long it's above 6 meters, so the duration is the time between these two points.

So, the duration is (16/7 -4/7)=12/7 seconds.

Wait, but let me think again: the quadratic was -49t² +140t -64=0. So when I solved using the quadratic formula, I got t=4/7 and 16/7. So that would make the time above 6 meters from 4/7 to 16/7, a duration of 12/7 seconds.

Looking at the options, option D is 12/7. So the answer should be D.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me recheck the discriminant:

b² is 140^2=19600, 4ac is 4*(-49)*(-64)=4*49*64.

Wait, 4*49=196, 196*64= (200-4)*64=200*64=12800, minus 4*64=256, so 12800-256=12544. So 4ac=12544.

So discriminant is 19600-12544=7056, which is correct. sqrt(7056) is 84.

Then, for the numerator, -140 ±84, so that's -140+84= -56, and -140-84=-224.

Denominator is 2*(-49)= -98.

So t= (-56)/(-98)=56/98=4/7, and t= (-224)/(-98)=224/98=16/7.

So the duration is 16/7 -4/7=12/7.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be D:12/7.

To determine how long the cannonball is above a height of 6 meters, we solve for the times when \( h(t) = 6 \). The height function is given as:

\[
h(t) = -4.9t^2 + 14t - 0.4
\]

Setting \( h(t) = 6 \):

\[
-4.9t^2 + 14t - 0.4 = 6
\]

Subtract 6 from both sides:

\[
-4.9t^2 + 14t - 6.4 = 0
\]

To eliminate decimals, multiply through by 10:

\[
-49t^2 + 140t - 64 = 0
\]

This is a quadratic equation of the form \( at^2 + bt + c = 0 \), where \( a = -49 \), \( b = 140 \), and \( c = -64 \). Using the quadratic formula:

\[
t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

First, calculate the discriminant:

\[
b^2 - 4ac = 140^2 - 4(-49)(-64) = 19600 - 12544 = 7056
\]

Taking the square root of the discriminant:

\[
\sqrt{7056} = 84
\]

Now solve for \( t \):

\[
t = \frac{-140 \pm 84}{2(-49)}
\]

For the first solution (\( +84 \)):

\[
t = \frac{-140 + 84}{-98} = \frac{-56}{-98} = \frac{4}{7}
\]

For the second solution (\( -84 \)):

\[
t = \frac{-140 - 84}{-98} = \frac{-224}{-98} = \frac{16}{7}
\]

The cannonball is above 6 meters between \( t = \frac{4}{7} \) and \( t = \frac{16}{7} \). The duration is:

\[
\frac{16}{7} - \frac{4}{7} = \frac{12}{7}
\]

Thus, the cannonball is above 6 meters for \( \frac{12}{7} \) seconds.

The correct answer is:

**D: \(\frac{12}{7}\)**
