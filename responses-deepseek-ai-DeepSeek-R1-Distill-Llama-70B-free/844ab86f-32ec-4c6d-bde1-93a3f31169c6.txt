Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about AdaBoost, and I'm a bit new to this topic. Let me try to break it down.

The question has two statements, and I need to evaluate whether each is true or false. Then, based on that, choose the correct option from A to J.

Statement 1: In AdaBoost, the weights of the misclassified examples go up by the same multiplicative factor.

Hmm, I remember that AdaBoost works by adjusting the weights of training examples after each iteration. When a weak classifier makes a mistake on some examples, those examples are given higher weights so that the next classifier focuses more on them. But wait, do all misclassified examples get multiplied by the same factor?

I think the adjustment factor depends on the error rate of the current classifier. The formula I recall is something like the factor being (e_t)/(1-e_t), where e_t is the error rate. So all misclassified examples get their weights multiplied by this same factor in each iteration. So yes, Statement 1 sounds correct. So Statement 1 is True.

Statement 2: In AdaBoost, the weighted training error e_t of the tth weak classifier tends to increase as a function of t.

Wait, I thought that the weighted training error actually decreases with each iteration. Because each weak classifier is supposed to do better on the data that the previous ones got wrong. The error rate e_t is used to compute the weight alpha_t for the classifier. If e_t is low, alpha_t is higher. But I think the series of e_t's actually decreases, not increases. Because each subsequent classifier is focusing more on the harder examples. So if the first e_t is, say, 0.3, the next might be 0.25, then 0.2, etc. So the training error tends to decrease over time, not increase. So Statement 2 would be False.

Wait, but wait. I'm a bit confused. The weighted training error for each classifier at step t is e_t. But AdaBoost can sometimes have classifiers with higher e_t if they're really bad, but I think overall, the intention is that e_t is less than 0.5, and over time, the errors would decrease as each step focuses on what was misclassified before. So I think Statement 2 is False.

So Statement 1 is True, Statement 2 is False. Now, looking at the options.

Option I says Statement 1 is True and Statement 2 is False. So the correct answer would be option I.

Statement 1 is True because in AdaBoost, the weights of misclassified examples are adjusted by the same multiplicative factor, which depends on the error rate of the current classifier. Statement 2 is False because the weighted training error \( e_t \) tends to decrease over iterations as each subsequent classifier focuses on the examples misclassified by the previous one. 

The correct option is:

I: True, False

Answer: I
