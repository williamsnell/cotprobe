Okay, so Lucy is counting by 2s, starting at 2 and ending at 50. I need to figure out which number she wouldn't count. Hmm, let's think about this.

Counting by 2s means she's going through even numbers, right? So she starts at 2, then 4, 6, 8, and so on until she reaches 50. So all the numbers she counts are even.

Looking at the options, I see A is 24, which is even. B is 4, also even. C is 22, even too. D is 2, definitely counted as she starts there. E is 11, which is odd. F is 38, even. G is 50, which is the stopping point, so she counts that. H is 48, even. I is 34, even.

Wait, so all the options except E are even numbers. Since Lucy is only counting even numbers, she wouldn't count 11. So the answer must be E.

Lucy is counting by even numbers starting from 2 and ending at 50. Among the options provided, all are even except for 11. Therefore, Lucy would not count 11.

Answer: E
