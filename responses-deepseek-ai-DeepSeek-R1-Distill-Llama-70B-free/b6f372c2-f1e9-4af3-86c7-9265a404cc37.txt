Question:

If a star that is 20 light-years from Earth explodes, gravitational waves from the explosion would reach Earth in

Options:

A: 10 years, as gravitational waves travel at double the speed of light

C: 40 years, as gravitational waves travel at half the speed of light
D: Instantly, as gravitational waves travel at infinite speed
E: 20 years.
F: None of these.
G: 100 years, as gravitational waves travel at a fifth the speed of light
H: more than 20 years.
I: less than 20 years.
J: It would never reach Earth

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this question about gravitational waves and how long it would take for them to reach Earth from an exploding star 20 light-years away. Hmm, I remember that gravitational waves are a big topic in physics, especially after they were detected a few years ago. 

Wait, gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime caused by massive objects accelerating, like when a star explodes or when black holes merge. I think they travel at the speed of light, right? Because Einstein's theory of general relativity says that's the case. So if the star is 20 light-years away, and the waves travel at light speed, it should take 20 years to reach us. 

Looking at the options, option E says 20 years. But wait, let me check the other options too. Option A says 10 years because they go double the speed of light. No, that's not right because nothing can go faster than light speed according to relativity. Option B is even worse, four times the speed? No. Option C is half, so 40 years. That doesn't fit either. Option D claims they travel infinitely fast, which I don't think is correct because only things like the expansion of the universe (like in inflation) might move faster, but gravitational waves are not supposed to. 

Option F is none of these, but I think E is correct. Wait, no, wait a second. Wait, the question is about gravitational waves. Do they travel at the speed of light? Yes, I'm pretty sure. So the time would be the same as light taking to reach us, so 20 years. So option E is the answer.

But wait, some of the other options. Option I says less than 20 years. That would imply gravitational waves are faster than light, which I don't think is the case. So E is correct. Unless I'm missing something.

Wait, let me make sure. So the distance is 20 light-years. If something travels at the speed of light, it takes 20 years to reach us. So the answer is E. So looking at the options, E is 20 years. So the correct answer should be E.

Gravitational waves travel at the speed of light, as predicted by Einstein's theory of general relativity. Since the star is 20 light-years away, the gravitational waves would take 20 years to reach Earth. 

- Option A is incorrect because gravitational waves do not travel at double the speed of light.
- Option B is incorrect because they do not travel at four times the speed of light.
- Option C is incorrect because they do not travel at half the speed of light.
- Option D is incorrect because gravitational waves do not travel at infinite speed.
- Option E is correct because 20 light-years divided by the speed of light equals 20 years.
- Option F is incorrect because E is a valid answer.
- Option G is incorrect because gravitational waves do not travel at a fifth the speed of light.
- Option H is incorrect because the time required is exactly 20 years, not more.
- Option I is incorrect because gravitational waves do not travel faster than the speed of light.
- Option J is incorrect because gravitational waves do reach Earth eventually.

The correct answer is **E: 20 years.**

Answer: E
