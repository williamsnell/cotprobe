Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about evidence admissibility in a trial. The scenario is a plaintiff suing an insurance company to recover life insurance proceeds, and the issue is the insured's correct date of birth. The question is asking which of the options is inadmissible if offered to prove that date.

First, I need to think about the rules of evidence, particularly what makes a document or item admissible. I remember that hearsay is a big issue here. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, and it's generally inadmissible unless there's an exception.

Let me go through each option:

Option A: A diary entry from the insured's mother noting the day of birth. Diaries are typically considered hearsay because they're statements made out of court. However, there's an exception for personal journals or diaries if the maker had no motive to misrepresent and the entries were made at the time of the event. So if the mother wrote it down when the insured was born, it might be admissible under the diary exception.

Option B: Family bible with the birth date. I recall that entries in family bibles are admissible under a hearsay exception, I think under the records of religious organizations or family records. So this is probably admissible.

Option C: Social media post from the insured celebrating their birthday. Social media posts are statements made by the person, so they might be admissible as a statement by a party opponent, but wait, the insured is the one whose date of birth is in question. If the plaintiff is the insured, then it's their own statement. But if the insured is deceased, then it's an out-of-court statement. Hmm. Wait, the insured is the person whose birth date is in question, so the plaintiff is probably the beneficiary. So the insured's social media post would be hearsay unless an exception applies. The statement would be offered to prove the date of birth, so it's hearsay. Unless it falls under a hearsay exception, it's inadmissible. I'm not sure if there's an exception that applies here. Maybe the residual exception, but that's more for unusual cases. I'm leaning towards this being inadmissible unless it's non-hearsay, like if it's offered to show the person celebrated on that day, but the question is about proving the correct date, so it's hearsay. So maybe C is inadmissible.

Option D: The insured's hospital birth record. Birth records are admissible as official records under FRE 803(9), I think. They're kept by public entities, so they're an exception to hearsay. So D is admissible.

Option E: Copy of the insured's driver's license with the birth date. Driver's licenses are government records, so under the official records exception, they're admissible. So E is okay.

Option F: Photocopy of the insured's birth certificate. Birth certificates are classic examples of admissible records under the official records exception. So F is admissible.

Option G: Family portrait engraved with ages. So it's a portrait with engraved ages. I'm not sure how reliable that is. It's probably hearsay because someone wrote the ages, but maybe it's admissible as a family record. Family records are another exception. If it's a genuine family record kept in good faith, then it's admissible. So maybe G is admissible.

Option H: Letter from childhood friend recalling shared birthdays. That's a statement from a friend, so it's hearsay. Unless there's an exception, it's inadmissible. The friend's letter is an out-of-court statement offered for the truth, so hearsay. Unless it falls under an exception like present sense impression or something, but I don't think so. So H is inadmissible.

Option I: School record indicating the date of birth. Schools keep records, so under the business records exception, it's admissible. So I is okay.

Option J: Sworn affidavit from the insured's brother. An affidavit is a sworn statement, so it's admissible as non-hearsay if it's based on personal knowledge. Wait, but affidavits are generally used in court proceedings. However, at trial, witnesses typically testify in person. But if the brother is unavailable, the affidavit could be used. Alternatively, if the affidavit is being offered as evidence, it's hearsay unless it's a party admission or falls under another exception. Wait, the brother's statement is a statement by a witness, but in an affidavit, it's a written statement. If it's offered to prove the birth date, it's hearsay. Unless the brother is testifying, but if he's not, then the affidavit is hearsay. Alternatively, under FRE 803(6), it might fall under a business records exception if kept in the regular course, but I don't think so. So J is hearsay and inadmissible unless an exception applies. But I'm not sure about that; maybe it's admissible as a statement by a family member under another exception? Wait, no, family records are a different category, but this is a personal affidavit. So I think J is hearsay and inadmissible.

Wait, but in trial, affidavits are usually not admissible unless the declarant is unavailable and it's a prior testimony or something. So in this case, if the brother is available, then the affidavit would be inadmissible as hearsay. So J is inadmissible.

So the question is which option is inadmissible. The options that are inadmissible are C, H, and J, I think.

Wait, the question is asking which is inadmissible. Let me think again.

Option C: Social media post. If the insured is deceased, then their statement would be hearsay, unless it's a dying declaration, but that's only for causes of death. Since the issue is birth date, that exception wouldn't apply. So C is inadmissible.

Option H: Letter from friend is hearsay, inadmissible.

Option J: Brother's affidavit is hearsay unless he's unavailable. So if he's available, the affidavit is inadmissible.

So the question is which one is inadmissible. The options are C, H, J.

But wait, the answer options are A to J, and the question is which is inadmissible.

Looking back, the question is about the insured's correct date of birth. So let me consider each option again.

Option C: Social media post from the insured. If the insured is the declarant, and they're a party (but the plaintiff is suing, so maybe the insured is the decedent). If the insured is deceased, then their social media post is hearsay. Unless it's a statement against interest or another exception, but I don't think so. So C is inadmissible.

Option H: Friend's letter. Hearsay, inadmissible.

Option J: Brother's affidavit. Hearsay, inadmissible.

But the question is which is inadmissible, and I need to choose one option.

Wait, perhaps the diary entry (A) is admissible because it's a personal record. So A is okay.

Family bible (B) is admissible under the family records exception.

So the options that are inadmissible would be C, H, J.

But the question is, which of the following is inadmissible. So the correct answer is one of these.

Wait, let me think again.

The options are:

A: Diary entry - admissible under personal journal exception.

B: Family bible - admissible.

C: Social media post - inadmissible hearsay.

D: Hospital birth record - admissible.

E: Driver's license - admissible.

F: Birth certificate - admissible.

G: Family portrait with ages - maybe admissible as family record.

H: Friend's letter - inadmissible.

I: School record - admissible.

J: Brother's affidavit - inadmissible.

So the question is, which is inadmissible. The options are C, H, J.

But the question asks, which is inadmissible if offered to prove the insured's correct date of birth.

So which of these is inadmissible.

Wait, but the social media post could be non-hearsay if it's not offered for the truth. But the question says it's offered to prove the correct date of birth, so it is for the truth. So it's hearsay, and unless an exception applies, it's inadmissible.

Similarly, the friend's letter is hearsay, and the brother's affidavit is hearsay.

So the possible answers are C, H, J.

But the question gives options A through J, and the correct answer is one of them.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C, H, or J. Let me think about each.

Option C: Social media post. It's a statement by the insured, offered to prove their birthday. If the insured is unavailable (like deceased), then it's hearsay. Unless it's a statement against interest, but that's not applicable here. So it's inadmissible.

Option H: Friend's letter is hearsay. Unless the friend is unavailable and it's a statement of a then-existing mental state, but I don't think so. So H is inadmissible.

Option J: Brother's affidavit. It's a sworn statement, but if the brother is available to testify, the affidavit is hearsay. If he's unavailable, then it could be admissible under a hearsay exception, but the question doesn't say he's unavailable. So J is inadmissible.

So the question is, which one is inadmissible. The options are C, H, J.

Wait, but looking back, the options are A-J. The question asks which is inadmissible. So perhaps the answer is H.

Wait, but the options are multiple, but only one is correct. Let me think again.

Another approach: which of these is not admissible under any exception.

Option C: Social media post. It's hearsay, but if it's a statement by the party (the insured), then under FRE 801(d)(2), it's not hearsay if it's offered against the party. Wait, no, because the plaintiff is the party suing, and the insured is likely the plaintiff or the decedent. So if the insured is the plaintiff, then their own statement is admissible as a party admission. But if the insured is deceased, and the plaintiff is the beneficiary, then the insured's statement is hearsay and only admissible if an exception applies.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me clarify.

In this case, the plaintiff is suing the insurance company. So the insured is probably the plaintiff or the person on whose life the policy was issued, perhaps deceased. If the insured is deceased, then their social media post is hearsay. Unless it's a statement that qualifies as a present sense impression or something else, but that's unlikely.

So option C's social media post is inadmissible.

Option H is a statement by a friend, so that's hearsay and inadmissible.

Option J: brother's affidavit. If the brother is available to testify, then the affidavit is inadmissible as hearsay. If he's unavailable, then under FRE 804, it could be admissible, but the question doesn't specify that. So J is inadmissible.

So the possible inadmissible options are C, H, J.

But the question is about which is inadmissible. So among the options, which one is inadmissible.

Wait, another thought: Are any of these options admissible under another rule?

Option C: Could the social media post be admissible under the business records exception? Probably not, because it's a personal post, not a business record. So it's hearsay.

Option H: The friend's letter is hearsay, unless it's a statement of personal knowledge, but even then, it's hearsay.

Option J: The brother's affidavit is hearsay unless it falls under an exception like a statement against interest, but that doesn't apply here.

So the inadmissible options are C, H, J.

But the question is which one is inadmissible. So perhaps the answer is C, H, or J.

Wait, the question is from a multiple-choice exam, so I need to choose the correct option. Let me think again.

Option G: Family portrait with ages. If it's a family portrait, perhaps it's a family record. FRE 803(20) allows for statements in family histories, so maybe G is admissible.

So the inadmissible options are C, H, J.

But the question is which one is inadmissible. So the answer must be either C, H, or J.

Looking at the options, I think H and J are more clearly hearsay and inadmissible. But perhaps the correct answer is C.

Wait, another approach: which of these items is not covered by any hearsay exception.

Option C: Social media post is hearsay. Unless it's a statement by the party against interest, but it's about their birthday, which isn't against their interest. So it's inadmissible.

Option H: Letter from friend is hearsay, inadmissible.

Option J: Affidavit from brother is hearsay, inadmissible.

So which of these is an option in the given options.

The question is which is inadmissible, so all three are inadmissible. But the options are A-J, so the question must have only one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the diary entry (A) is inadmissible. No, wait, diaries are admissible under the personal records exception.

Wait, the options are A-J, and the question is which is inadmissible.

Wait, maybe the answer is C because social media posts are generally not considered reliable and more likely to be hearsay without an exception, making them inadmissible.

Alternatively, perhaps the family portrait (G) is inadmissible because it's not a reliable source. But I think family records are admissible.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me try to eliminate.

Option C: Social media post. If the insured is the one who posted, and they're a party, then under FRE 801(d)(2)(A), it's not hearsay because it's a statement offered against the party. Wait, no. The plaintiff is the party, and the insured is the person whose birth date is in question. If the insured is the plaintiff, then yes, their own statement is admissible as a party admission. But if the insured is deceased and the plaintiff is the beneficiary, then the statement is hearsay.

This is getting a bit too deep. Maybe the correct answer is C.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is H, because a letter from a friend is clearly hearsay and doesn't fall under any exception.

But I'm not entirely sure. I think the most likely inadmissible option is C, the social media post, because it's hearsay and doesn't fall under an exception.

Wait, but if the insured is alive and is the plaintiff, then their own statement would be admissible as a party admission. But the question doesn't specify that the insured is alive or deceased. So perhaps the safest assumption is that the insured is deceased, making the social media post hearsay without an exception, thus inadmissible.

So I think the answer is C.

To determine which option is inadmissible if offered to prove the insured's correct date of birth, we must analyze each option under the rules of evidence, particularly focusing on hearsay and its exceptions.

### Analysis of Each Option:

1. **Option A: A diary entry from the insured's mother noting the day of the insured's birth.**  
   Diary entries are generally admissible under the "personal journal" exception to hearsay if the entries were made at the time of the event and the maker had no motive to misrepresent. This makes Option A **admissible**.

2. **Option B: A family bible with the insured's birth date inscribed on the cover.**  
   Family bibles are admissible under the "family records" exception to hearsay. This makes Option B **admissible**.

3. **Option C: A social media post from the insured, celebrating their birthday.**  
   Social media posts are hearsay because they are out-of-court statements offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. If the insured is deceased, no exception applies (e.g., it is not a dying declaration or a statement against interest). If the insured is alive, it could be admissible as a party admission, but the question does not specify this. Assuming the insured is unavailable, this makes Option C **inadmissible**.

4. **Option D: The insured's hospital birth record.**  
   Hospital birth records are admissible as official records under FRE 803(9). This makes Option D **admissible**.

5. **Option E: A copy of the insured's driver's license with the birth date.**  
   Driver's licenses are government records and are admissible under the official records exception. This makes Option E **admissible**.

6. **Option F: A photocopy of the insured's birth certificate.**  
   Birth certificates are classic examples of admissible records under the official records exception. This makes Option F **admissible**.

7. **Option G: A family portrait engraved with the ages of the family members.**  
   Family portraits with engraved ages may qualify as family records, making them admissible under the family records exception. This makes Option G **admissible**.

8. **Option H: A letter from the insured's childhood friend, recalling their shared birthdays.**  
   This is hearsay because it is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. No exception applies, making Option H **inadmissible**.

9. **Option I: A school record indicating the insured's date of birth.**  
   School records are admissible under the business records exception. This makes Option I **admissible**.

10. **Option J: A sworn affidavit from the insured's brother verifying the insured's birth date.**  
    An affidavit is hearsay unless the declarant is unavailable and a hearsay exception applies. If the brother is available to testify, the affidavit is inadmissible. This makes Option J **inadmissible**.

### Conclusion:
The inadmissible options are **C**, **H**, and **J**. However, since the question asks for a single answer, **Option C** (the social media post) is the most likely correct answer because it is clearly hearsay without an applicable exception in the context provided.
