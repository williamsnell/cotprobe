Okay, so I've got this problem about designing a steel spindle. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I remember from my mechanics classes that when dealing with power transmission, especially with shafts, we have to consider torsion. Oh right, the spindle is under torsional stress because it's transmitting power.

The problem states that the spindle is 4 feet long and needs to transmit 10 horsepower at 600 rpm. Oh wait, the maximum allowable angular deflection is 0.1 degrees per foot. So, the total deflection for 4 feet would be 0.4 degrees. I think I need to calculate the required diameter to ensure this deflection, and then find the shear stress.

I recall the formula for angular deflection in a shaft under torsion is θ = (TL)/(GJ), where T is the torque, L is the length, G is the modulus of rigidity, and J is the polar moment of inertia. Right, and J for a solid shaft is (π d^4)/32, where d is the diameter.

So first, I need to find the torque T. Power is related to torque and angular velocity by P = T * ω. The power here is 10 hp. I should convert that into foot-pounds per minute or per second because the units need to match.

Wait, 1 horsepower is 550 foot-pounds per second. So 10 hp is 550 * 10 = 5500 ft-lb/s. But the rpm is 600 revolutions per minute. I need to convert that to radians per second because torque equations use angular velocity in radians per second.

So, 600 rpm is 600 revolutions per minute. Each revolution is 2π radians, so 600 * 2π = 1200π radians per minute. To get per second, divide by 60: 1200π /60 = 20π rad/s. So ω is 20π rad/s.

Now, torque T = P / ω. P is 5500 ft-lb/s. So T = 5500 / (20π). Let's compute that: 5500 divided by (20 * 3.1416) ≈ 5500 /62.832 ≈ about 87.5 ft-lb. Wait, let me calculate more accurately. 20 * π is approximately 62.8319. 5500 /62.8319 is approximately 87.5 ft-lb. So T ≈ 87.5 ft-lb.

Next, using the angular deflection formula θ = (T L) / (G J). We need to solve for diameter d.

Given:
- θ = 0.4 degrees. Oh wait, the formula uses radians, right? So I need to convert 0.4 degrees to radians. 0.4 * (π/180) = approximately 0.006981 radians.

- L = 4 ft.

- G = 1e7 psi. Wait, modulus of rigidity is given as 1 × 10^7 psi. So G = 1e7 psi.

J is (π d^4)/32.

Putting it all together:

θ = (T L) / (G J)

Rearranging for J:

J = (T L) / (G θ)

But J is (π d^4)/32. So,

(π d^4)/32 = (T L) / (G θ)

Solving for d:

d^4 = (32 T L) / (G θ π )

Plugging in the numbers:

T is 87.5 ft-lb. Wait, units! Oh wait, I need to make sure all units are consistent. Because G is in psi, which is pounds per square inch. So I should convert T and L into inches.

Length L is 4 ft = 48 inches.

Torque T is 87.5 ft-lb. 1 ft is 12 inches, so 87.5 ft-lb = 87.5 * 12 in-lb = 1050 in-lb.

So plugging in:

d^4 = (32 * 1050 in-lb * 48 in) / (1e7 psi * 0.006981 rad * π )

Wait, let me compute numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: 32 * 1050 * 48.

32 *1050 = 33,600.

33,600 *48 = let's see. 33,600 *40 = 1,344,000; 33,600 *8=268,800. So total is 1,612,800.

Denominator: 1e7 * 0.006981 * π.

1e7 is 10,000,000.

0.006981 * π ≈ 0.021917 (since π is about 3.1416, 0.006981*3.1416≈0.021917).

So denominator is 10,000,000 * 0.021917 ≈ 219,170.

So d^4 = 1,612,800 / 219,170 ≈ approximately 7,360. Let me compute that.

Wait, wait, 1,612,800 ÷ 219,170 → let's compute 219170 *7= 1,534,190. That's less than 1,612,800. 219170*7.35 ≈? Let's see, 0.35 *219170=76,719.5. So 1,534,190 +76,719.5=1,610,909.5. Close to 1,612,800. So 7.35 is about 1,610k, so the actual value is a bit higher. Let's say approximately 7.35.

So d^4 ≈7360. So d^4 =7360 → d≈ (7360)^(1/4).

Compute 7360^(1/4):

Let me see, 10^4 is 10,000. 9^4 is 6561. So 7360 is between 9^4 and 10^4.

Compute 9.5^4: (9.5)^2=90.25; (90.25)^2= approx 8145. So 9.5^4 is 8145, which is higher than 7360.

Hmm, let me try 9.3^4. 9.3^2 is 86.49. 86.49 squared is approximately 7480, which is a bit higher than 7360.

Wait, 9.3^4= (9.3)^2 * (9.3)^2 = 86.49 *86.49= approx 7480. But we have 7360, which is a bit less. So maybe 9.25.

Compute 9.25^4: 9.25^2=85.5625. 85.5625 squared again: 85.5625 *85.5625. Let me compute that. 85^2 is 7225. 0.5625^2 is 0.3164. The cross terms: 2*(85)*(0.5625)=95. So 7225 +95*(0.5625?) Wait, maybe it's easier to compute 85.5625 *85.5625 exactly.

Alternatively, I could compute 9.25^4 as (9.25)^2 squared. 9.25 squared is 85.5625. So 85.5625 squared is 7311.914. Oh, wait that's close to 7360. So 9.25^4 is approximately 7311.9, which is a bit less than 7360.

So d^4 is 7360, so d is about 9.27 (since 9.25^4 is 7311, and 9.3^4 is 7480, which is higher) Let me compute 9.27^4.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let me compute 9.27^4.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute d^4 as 7360, so the fourth root of 7360.

Alternatively, using logarithms:

ln(7360) = ln(7.36e3) = ln(7.36) + 3 ln(10).

ln(7.36) ≈ 2.00 (since e^2≈7.389). So ln(7360)=2.00 + 3*2.3026= 2 +6.9078=8.9078.

So ln(d) = (1/4)*8.9078≈2.22695. So d= e^2.22695 ≈ 9.27 in.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because the options don't have a 9.27 inch diameter. Wait, wait, something's wrong here.

Wait, wait, modulus of rigidity is given as 1e7 psi. Oh wait, the units. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, when I converted T to in-lb, I did 87.5 ft-lb * 12 in/ft = 1050 in-lb. That's correct.

L is 4 ft →48 inches. Correct.

θ is 0.4 degrees, which I converted to radians as 0.006981 radians. Right.

So the formula is d^4 = (32 * T * L) / (G * θ * π )

Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the formula. Let me check the formula again.

The formula for θ is θ = (T L) / (G J). J for a solid shaft is (π d^4)/32.

So θ = (T L) * 32 / (G π d^4 )

So rearranging, d^4 = (32 T L) / (G θ π )

That's correct. So plugging in the numbers again.

T=1050 in-lb.

L=48 in.

G=1e7 psi.

θ=0.006981 radians.

So numerator: 32 *1050 *48 = 32*1050=33,600; 33,600 *48=1,612,800 in^2-lbs.

Denominator: 1e7 psi * 0.006981 radians * π.

Compute denominator: 1e7 *0.006981=6.981e4. Multiply by π (≈3.1416) → 6.981e4 *3.1416≈219,170.

So d^4=1,612,800 /219,170 ≈7360.

Wait, same as before. So d^4=7360. So d= (7360)^(1/4). Let me calculate that more accurately.

Wait, 10^4=10,000. 9^4=6561. 9.5^4=8145. So 7360 is between 9^4 and 9.5^4.

Wait, 9.3^4 is 9.3*9.3*9.3*9.3. 9.3^2=86.49. Then 86.49^2= approx 7480. So 9.3^4 is 7480, which is higher than 7360.

So d is a bit less than 9.3 inches. Let's try 9.25 inches.

d=9.25 in. Compute d^4.

d^4 = (9.25)^4. Let me compute 9.25^2=85.5625. Then 85.5625^2=7311.914. So 9.25^4=7311.9, which is less than 7360.

Difference is 7360-7311.9≈48.1. So to get to 7360, how much more than 9.25?

Let me compute 9.27^4. I'll compute 9.27^2=85.9129. Then 85.9129^2= approx (85.9)^2=7373.21. Hmm, that's higher than 7360. So 9.27^4≈7373. So 7373 is higher than 7360 by 13.

So, linear approximation: between 9.25 and 9.27, the value goes from 7311.9 to 7373.2. The target is 7360. The difference between target and 7311.9 is 48.1. The total range is 7373.2-7311.9≈61.3. So 48.1 is about 78% of the way. So delta d is 0.02 in (from 9.25 to 9.27 is 0.02) for 61.3 change in d^4.

So 0.78 *0.02=0.0156 in. So d≈9.25 +0.0156≈9.2656 in.

Wait, but wait a second, that's over 9 inches, but the options are all below 3.5 inches. Oh wait, that can't be right. I must have messed up the units somewhere.

Wait, wait a minute. Oh no! I think I mixed up units for L and T. Let me double-check the units.

Because in the formula, J is in in^4, T is in in-lb, L is in inches, G is in psi (lb/in^2), and θ is in radians.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of d^4. Let me compute the denominator correctly.

Wait, G is 1e7 psi, which is lb per square inch.

So the denominator in the d^4 equation is G (lb/in²) * θ (dimensionless) * π (dimensionless). So the denominator has units of lb/in².

The numerator is 32 (dimensionless) * T (in-lb) * L (in). So 32*T*L has units of in-lb * in = in² lb.

So when we divide numerator by denominator: (in² lb) / (lb/in²) )= in^4. So the units are correct, leading to d^4 in in^4. So the calculation seems correct, but the resulting d is over 9 inches, which doesn't match any of the options. So clearly, I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the calculation of torque T. Let me recheck that.

Power P is 10 hp. 1 hp is 550 ft-lb/s, so 10 hp is 5500 ft-lb/s.

Angular velocity ω is 600 rpm. Convert that to radians per second.

600 rpm = 600 rev/min → 600 * 2π rad/rev /60 s/min = 20π rad/s ≈62.8319 rad/s.

So T= P / ω = 5500 ft-lb/s / 62.8319 rad/s ≈ 5500/62.8319 ≈87.5 ft-lb.

Wait, but that's correct.

Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the conversion of units for T from ft-lb to in-lb. Because when calculating the torque in in-lb, I multiplied by 12 (since 1 ft =12 in), so 87.5 ft-lb = 1050 in-lb. That's correct.

Wait, but wait, the problem says the spindle is 4 ft long, but I converted that to inches, so L=48 in. Correct.

G is 1e7 psi. Correct.

θ is 0.4 degrees for 4 ft, which is 0.1 per ft. So 0.4 degrees. Converted to radians: 0.4 * π/180 ≈0.006981 rad. Correct.

Wait, maybe I should compute d^4 again.

d^4 = (32 * T * L) / (G * θ * π )

T is 1050 in-lb.

So 32 * 1050 = 33,600.

33,600 * 48 = 1,612,800.

Denominator: 1e7 * 0.006981 * π ≈ 1e7 * 0.021917 ≈219,170.

So d^4=1,612,800 / 219,170 ≈7360.

So d ≈ cube root? No, fourth root.

Wait, wait a second, I think I see the mistake. Oh wait, in the formula, J is (π d^4)/32. So when we plug J into the equation, we have:

θ = (T L) / (G * (π d^4)/32 )

So θ = (32 T L) / (G π d^4 )

So when solving for d^4, it's (32 T L) / (G π θ )

Which is what I did. Hmm.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the problem expects the use of the formula for angle in degrees, but the formula I used is in radians. Did I make a mistake in the unit conversion?

Wait, no. Because the formula uses θ in radians. So the conversion to radians is correct.

But given that the answer is coming out to around 9.26 inches, but the options go up to 3.2 in (option G), I'm clearly doing something wrong.

Wait, perhaps I've messed up the formula. Let me think again. Another approach: the formula for torque is T = (G J θ)/L.

Wait, because θ = (T L)/(G J), so T= (G J θ)/L.

But J is (π d^4)/32.

So T= (G * (π d^4)/32 * θ ) / L.

Rearranged, T= (G π θ d^4 )/(32 L )

But T is also equal to P/ω.

So, setting equal:

P/ω = (G π θ d^4 )/(32 L )

So, solving for d^4:

d^4 = (32 P L ) / (G π θ ω )

Wait, let me check the units here. P is in ft-lb/s, ω is in rad/s, L is in ft.

Hmm, perhaps I should keep all units consistent. Let me try this approach.

Convert all units to inches and seconds.

P is 10 hp = 5500 ft-lb/s.

ω is 600 rpm = 20π rad/s.

L is 4 ft =48 inches.

θ is 0.4 degrees = 0.006981 rad.

So, plug into the equation d^4=(32 P L )/(G π θ ω )

Wait, wait, let me make sure I include the correct variables.

Wait, no, I think it's:

From T = P/(ω) = (G J θ ) / L

So,

P/(ω) = (G J θ ) / L

J= (π d^4)/32

So,

P/(ω) = (G * (π d
