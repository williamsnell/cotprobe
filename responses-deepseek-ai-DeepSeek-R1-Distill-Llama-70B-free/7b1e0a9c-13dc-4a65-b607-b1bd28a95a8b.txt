Okay, I need to tackle this multiple-choice question, which has two statements about PCA, Spectral Clustering, and logistic vs. linear regression. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, Statement 1 says that PCA and Spectral Clustering (like Andrew Ng's) perform eigendecomposition on two different matrices, but the sizes are the same. Wait, I remember that PCA does eigendecomposition on the covariance matrix. The covariance matrix is of size d x d, where d is the number of features. So for PCA, the matrix is square and based on the data features.

On the other hand, Spectral Clustering uses the Laplacian matrix, right? The Laplacian is constructed from the adjacency matrix of the data points, which is n x n, where n is the number of data points. So the matrix for Spectral Clustering is n x n, while PCA's is d x d. So the sizes are different unless d equals n, which isn't generally the case. So Statement 1 claims the sizes are the same, which is false. So Statement 1 is false.

Now, Statement 2: Since classification is a special case of regression, logistic regression is a special case of linear regression. Wait, classification is not exactly a special case of regression. Regression is about predicting a continuous output, while classification predicts categorical labels. However, logistic regression is used for classification, but it's based on a different model than linear regression.

Wait, but technically, I've heard that in some contexts, classification can be thought of as a form of regression where the output is a probability (like in logistic regression). So maybe there's some nuance here. But I think the statement is a bit of a stretch. Because linear regression assumes a linear relationship and uses least squares, while logistic regression uses a logistic function and maximum likelihood. So they're different approaches.

So Statement 2 is saying that because classification is a special case of regression, logistic is a special case of linear regression. I think that's false because even if classification could be seen as a type of regression, logistic regression isn't a subset of linear regression. They're both forms of regression (logistic is a type of regression for classification), but not special cases in that way.

So Statement 1 is false, and Statement 2 is also false.

Wait, but wait another thought about Statement 2. Oh, no, wait. The statement says 'since classification is a special case of regression, logistic is a special case of linear.' Wait, no, because classification isn't a subset of regression. So the premise is wrong. So the entire statement is false.

So both statements are false. Now, looking at the options, I need to find which option says both are false.

Looking at the options:

Option H: False, False. So that's the choice.

Statement 1: PCA performs eigendecomposition on the covariance matrix (size \(d \times d\), where \(d\) is the number of features), while Spectral Clustering uses the Laplacian matrix (size \(n \times n\), where \(n\) is the number of data points). These matrices are of different sizes unless \(d = n\), which is generally not the case. Therefore, Statement 1 is **False**.

Statement 2: Classification and regression are distinct tasks. While logistic regression is used for classification and linear regression for continuous outputs, logistic regression is not a special case of linear regression. They are fundamentally different methods with different objectives and assumptions. Thus, Statement 2 is also **False**.

Both statements are false.
