Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about the Euler equations and a uniform sphere's moments of inertia. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my studies.

Alright, the question says that for a uniform sphere, I₁ = I₂ = I₃. Right, I remember that for a solid sphere, the moment of inertia about any axis through its center is (2/5)MR². So all three moments here are equal. That's probably important because it simplifies the Euler equations.

Euler equations, right. Those are the ones that describe the rotation of a rigid body. The equations are something like the time derivatives of the angular momenta equal to the sum of the torques plus some terms involving the products of the other angular velocities and moments of inertia. Oh wait, the exact form is:

dL₁/dt = (I₂ - I₃)ω₂ω₃ + N₁
dL₂/dt = (I₃ - I₁)ω₃ω₁ + N₂
dL₃/dt = (I₁ - I₂)ω₁ω₂ + N₃

Wait no, I think I might have mixed up the terms. Let me get it right. Actually, the Euler equations are:

I₁ dω₁/dt = (I₂ - I₃) ω₂ ω₃ + N₁
I₂ dω₂/dt = (I₃ - I₁) ω₃ ω₁ + N₂
I₃ dω₃/dt = (I₁ - I₂) ω₁ ω₂ + N₃

But wait, in this case, I₁ = I₂ = I₃ = I. So substituting that into the equations, each equation becomes I dω_i/dt = 0 + N_i, because the terms with (I_j - I_k) become zero.

So that simplifies each equation to I dω_i/dt = N_i.

But wait, the question is about the equation of motion. So if we consider the case where there's no external torque, which is probably the scenario here since the question doesn't specify any torques. So if N₁ = N₂ = N₃ = 0, then each equation becomes I dω_i/dt = 0. Which means dω_i/dt = 0, so each ω is constant.

Wait, so the angular velocities in the body-fixed frame are constant? Or does that mean the angular velocity vector is constant in an inertial frame? Hmm, I think in the absence of external torques, the angular momentum is constant, which for a symmetric object like a sphere would mean that the angular velocity is constant in direction and magnitude.

Wait, but the Euler equations are written in the body frame, right? So if the torques are zero, then the body's angular velocities about each axis are constant. So the sphere's rotation is uniform in that case.

So looking at the options, let's see. The options are:

A: ω = const
B: N = Iω
C: Ṅ = const
D: N = const
E: I = const
F: ω = Iω̇
G: ω = 0
H: ω = I/N
I: ω̇ = 0
J: ω ∝ t

Wait, I need to translate this into the equations. So, from Euler's equations with I₁=I₂=I₃=I and no external torques (N₁=N₂=N₃=0), each equation becomes I * dω_i/dt = 0. So dω_i/dt = 0, meaning the time derivatives of the components of ω are zero. So each ω_i is constant. That is, ω̇ = 0. So the angular acceleration is zero.

So the equation of motion would be dω/dt = 0, which implies that ω is constant. So ω doesn't change over time. So the correct equation is ω = constant, which is option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option I says ω̇ = 0, which is the same as dω/dt = 0, so that would also make sense. Hmm, so maybe I should think again.

Wait, the Euler equations are in the body frame. So if the sphere is symmetric, and there's no torque, then the angular velocity vector doesn't change in the body frame. But in reality, without external torque, the angular momentum is conserved, meaning the angular velocity vector (in inertial frame) is constant in direction and magnitude. But in the body frame, that's only true if the body is not rotating, which is not the case. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Wait, no. Euler's equations describe the rotation in the body-fixed frame. So if the torques are zero, then the body's rotation rates about each axis are constant. So ω₁, ω₂, ω₃ are all constants. That would mean the angular velocity vector in the body frame is constant. But in the inertial frame, if the body is rotating, the orientation changes, so the components of angular velocity in inertial frame would change. But in the body frame, they're constant.

Wait, but the question says "equation of motion of the sphere." So perhaps it's referring to the angular velocity in the inertial frame. If there's no torque, then the angular momentum L is constant. For a sphere, since I is isotropic (I₁=I₂=I₃), L = I ω, so if L is constant, then ω must also be constant in the inertial frame. Because I is the same in all directions.

Wait, but in that case, ω would be a constant vector, meaning its magnitude and direction don't change over time. So in that case, the equation of motion is ω = const, which is option A.

Alternatively, if we're considering the body frame, then the components of ω are constant, so ω₁ = const, ω₂ = const, ω₃ = const. But the question just says "the equation of motion," without specifying the frame. But the Euler equations are in the body frame. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, the Euler equations in the case of I₁=I₂=I₃ and N=0 give dω_i/dt = 0. So each component of ω is constant. So the angular velocity vector in the body frame is constant. But in the absence of external torques, the angular momentum (which is I times the angular velocity in the inertial frame) is constant. So perhaps in the inertial frame, ω is also constant.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again. The question says to use the Euler equations. So the equations we have are I dω/dt = N, where N is the torque. But if there's no torque, then dω/dt = 0, so ω is constant in the body frame. But in the body frame, the components of ω are fixed, but physically, the sphere is rotating, so in the inertial frame, the direction of ω would change unless it's rotating about a principal axis.

Wait, maybe I should think about torque. If there's no external torque, then the Euler equations (with I's equal) give each component of angular acceleration zero. So ω is constant in the body frame. But that's only possible if the rotation is about a principal axis, which for a sphere, any axis is a principal axis. So the sphere is rotating about some axis, and since there's no torque, it continues to rotate with the same angular velocity vector in the body frame.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because if the body is rotating, the body frame is rotating, so the components of ω in the body frame might not change, but in an inertial frame, the direction of ω would change unless it's aligned with the rotation axis. Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing frames here.

Wait, maybe I should think of it this way: For a sphere with I₁=I₂=I₃, in the absence of external torques, the Euler equations reduce to dω_i/dt = 0. So each component of the angular velocity in the body frame is constant. So the angular velocity vector in the body frame is constant. But in the inertial frame, unless the angular velocity is along a principal axis, the orientation of the angular velocity vector would change, but for a sphere, any axis is a principal axis, so maybe it's okay.

Alternatively, perhaps because the torque is zero, the angular momentum is constant. Since L = I ω, and I is a scalar (because all I's are equal), then L = I ω, so ω must be constant in the inertial frame as well.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Let me think about torque. If there's no torque, then the Euler equation in vector form (when I is a scalar) would be I dω/dt = 0. So ω is constant in the inertial frame. So the angular velocity doesn't change, meaning ω = const, which is option A.

Wait, but is that correct? Because the Euler equations are in the body frame, but when I is isotropic, perhaps the equations simplify in a way that the angular velocity in the inertial frame is constant.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct equation is that the angular acceleration is zero, so ω̇ = 0, which is option I. But wait, option I says ω̇ = 0, which would mean that the rate of change of ω is zero, implying ω is constant. So both options A and I suggest that ω is constant, but I think the correct answer is either A or I.

But looking at the options:

A: ω = const

I: ω̇ = 0

Wait, these are equivalent, because if ω̇ is zero, then ω is constant. So both A and I would be correct in that sense. But looking back at the question, it's to find the equation of motion. The equation of motion would be the Euler equation, which in this case reduces to I dω/dt = 0, so dω/dt = 0, which is option I.

But wait, the Euler equation is I dω/dt = N. So when N=0, it's I dω/dt = 0, so dω/dt = 0, which is option I. So maybe the correct answer is I.

But earlier I thought the result is ω = const, which is option A. So I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation of motion is that the angular velocity is constant, which would be option A. Because the equation of motion would describe the time evolution, so dω/dt = 0 implies ω is constant.

Wait, but the actual Euler equation when N=0 is I * dω/dt = 0, so dω/dt = 0, which is option I. So the equation is dω/dt = 0, which is option I. So that's the equation of motion.

Wait, but looking at the options, option I is "ω̇ = 0", which is exactly what we have. So the correct answer is I.

But wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let me think again. The question says "use the Euler equations to find the equation of motion of the sphere." So the Euler equations would directly give something. Since I₁=I₂=I₃ and assuming no external torque, the Euler equations reduce to I * (dω₁/dt) = 0, and similarly for the other components. So each component of ω is constant, so the equation of motion is dω/dt = 0, which is option I.

So the correct answer should be I.

For a uniform sphere with equal moments of inertia \( I_1 = I_2 = I_3 = I \), the Euler equations simplify significantly. The Euler equations are:

\[
I_1 \frac{d\omega_1}{dt} = (I_2 - I_3)\omega_2\omega_3 + N_1,
\]
\[
I_2 \frac{d\omega_2}{dt} = (I_3 - I_1)\omega_3\omega_1 + N_2,
\]
\[
I_3 \frac{d\omega_3}{dt} = (I_1 - I_2)\omega_1\omega_2 + N_3.
\]

Since \( I_1 = I_2 = I_3 = I \), the terms involving \((I_2 - I_3)\), \((I_3 - I_1)\), and \((I_1 - I_2)\) vanish. This reduces the Euler equations to:

\[
I \frac{d\omega_1}{dt} = N_1,
\]
\[
I \frac{d\omega_2}{dt} = N_2,
\]
\[
I \frac{d\omega_3}{dt} = N_3.
\]

If there is no external torque (\( N_1 = N_2 = N_3 = 0 \)), these equations further simplify to:

\[
\frac{d\omega_1}{dt} = 0,
\]
\[
\frac{d\omega_2}{dt} = 0,
\]
\[
\frac{d\omega_3}{dt} = 0.
\]

This implies that the components of the angular velocity vector \(\omega\) in the body-fixed frame are constant, i.e., \(\dot{\omega} = 0\). Therefore, the equation of motion for the sphere is \(\dot{\omega} = 0\).

Analyzing the options:

- **A: \(\omega = \text{const}\)**: This is true in the inertial frame if there is no external torque, as angular momentum is conserved. However, the Euler equations directly describe the body-fixed frame, where \(\dot{\omega} = 0\) is the correct equation of motion.
- **I: \(\dot{\omega} = 0\)**: This is the direct result of the Euler equations for a sphere with no external torque and is the correct equation of motion in the body-fixed frame.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**I: \(\dot{\omega} = 0\)**.

Answer: I
