Question:

Okay, so I need to figure out the correct answer to this economics question. Let's read through it carefully.

The question is about Nancy's choice of how to spend one hour. She can either study, mow the lawn for $6, or babysit for $8. We know she chose to study, and we need to determine which option correctly describes what's true in this situation.

First, let me recall some basic economics concepts. Opportunity cost refers to the value of the next best alternative that you give up when making a decision. So, if Nancy chooses to study, her opportunity cost would be the next best thing she could have done instead. In this case, the options she gave up are mowing the lawn ($6) and babysitting ($8). Since babysitting pays more, that's the higher value alternative she gave up. So the opportunity cost should be $8.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A says the opportunity cost is $6, equal to the benefit. That doesn't seem right because the next best alternative is higher at $8. So A is wrong.

Option B states the opportunity cost is $14, which is less than the benefit. Wait, $14 isn't an option. The two options are $6 and $8. $14 would be if she considered both, but that's not how opportunity cost works. So B is incorrect.

Option C says she has no other options besides these three. But the question only presents three choices, but it's possible she might have others. However, the question doesn't specify, so I can't assume that. So C might not be necessarily true.

Option D: Nancy values studying more than earning $6 from mowing. Well, since she chose studying over both, it's true she values it more than $6. But what about $8? Because she also chose studying over the higher paying babysitting job. So D is correct in part, but doesn't address the higher opportunity cost.

Option E says she's indifferent between studying and mowing. But if she chose studying, it's more valuable to her than mowing, so she's not indifferent. E is wrong.

Option F claims her behavior is irrational because babysitting pays more. But economics doesn't judge rationality that way; she might value studying more for personal reasons. So F is incorrect.

Option G: The benefit from studying is less than the $8 opportunity cost. If that were true, she wouldn't choose studying. So G is wrong.

Option H: The benefit from studying is greater than the $8 opportunity cost. That makes sense because she chose it, implying the benefit outweighs the next best alternative. So H seems correct.

Option I: Opportunity cost is $8, but the benefit is unmeasurable. This is partially correct because the opportunity cost is indeed $8. But the benefit doesn't have to be unmeasurable; it's just that non-monetary benefits are hard to quantify. But the question is about which statement is true. So I could be a contender.

Option J: She prefers babysitting to studying but chose to study. That doesn't make sense because if she preferred babysitting, she would have chosen it. So J is wrong.

Wait, back to options H and I. H says the benefit is greater than $8. I says the opportunity cost is $8, and the benefit is unmeasurable.

In economics, the benefit from the chosen option must be at least equal to or greater than the opportunity cost. So if she chose studying, the benefit must be >= $8, otherwise she would have picked babysitting. But the exact benefit isn't known; but H states it's greater than $8, which may not necessarily be the case. It could be exactly equal, but that's not an option. However, since she chose it, the benefit must be at least as much as the opportunity cost. So H is correct in that the benefit is greater than the opportunity cost of $8.

Alternatively, option I says the opportunity cost is $8 and the benefit is unmeasurable. That's also correct. But which one is true?

Wait, the question is about what is necessarily true. So the opportunity cost is definitely $8 because that's the next best alternative. The benefit from studying is not necessarily greater than $8; it could be exactly equal. But in reality, she must value it at least as much as $8, otherwise she wouldn't choose it. So H says it's greater, which might not always hold if it's exactly equal. Hmm.

But in economics, when you choose an option, the benefit is at least equal to the opportunity cost. So the benefit >= opportunity cost. So H says it's greater than, which is one possibility, but it could also be equal.

Wait, but H says "greater than the opportunity cost of $8". So if the benefit is exactly $8, then H would be incorrect. But if she chose it, the benefit must be at least $8. So H could be true, but it's not necessarily the only possibility.

Alternatively, option I says the opportunity cost is $8, which is correct. And the benefit is unmeasurable. That's also correct because studying's benefits might be non-monetary, like better exam results leading to a better job, etc. So I is a correct statement.

So now I'm a bit confused between H and I. Let me read the question again. It says, "which of the following is true?" So both H and I could be correct, but I need to see which is among the options.

Wait, option H says the benefit is greater than the opportunity cost. But if the benefit equals the opportunity cost, she would still choose it. So H's statement isn't necessarily true. For example, if studying gave her exactly $8 in value, she would still choose it over babysitting. So H's statement that it's greater than isn't necessarily correct. So I might be the correct answer then.

Wait, but the question is about the opportunity cost and the benefit. The opportunity cost is $8, regardless of whether the benefit is higher or equal, because opportunity cost is the value of the next best alternative. So the opportunity cost is definitely $8.

So option I says the opportunity cost is $8 and the benefit is unmeasurable. That's correct because studying doesn't have a direct monetary value, but the opportunity cost is the forgone $8 from babysitting.

So option I is correct. Wait, but let me check the other options again.

Option D says she values studying more than $6. That's true because she chose it over mowing. But she also chose it over $8, so D is only partially correct.

So the correct statements would be I and H? Wait, the options are:

H: The benefit received from studying is greater than the opportunity cost of $8.

I: The opportunity cost of studying is $8, but the benefit of studying is unmeasurable.

So which is correct?

The question is about what is true. It's definitely true that the opportunity cost is $8. Whether the benefit is greater or just equal, we don't know. But in H, the statement is that the benefit is greater than $8, which may not necessarily be the case. So H could be incorrect if the benefit is exactly $8.

But I says the opportunity cost is $8, which is correct, and that the benefit is unmeasurable, which is true because studying doesn't have a direct monetary value. So I is correct.

So the correct answer would be I.

To determine the correct answer, we analyze Nancy's decision to study instead of mowing the lawn ($6) or babysitting ($8). The key concept here is **opportunity cost**, which is the value of the next best alternative foregone. Since babysitting pays $8 and is the higher-paying option, the opportunity cost of studying is $8.

### Analysis of Each Option:
- **A**: Incorrect. The opportunity cost is $8, not $6, as babysitting is the next best alternative.
- **B**: Incorrect. The opportunity cost is not $14; it is $8, as only the next best alternative (babysitting) is considered.
- **C**: Incorrect. The question does not state that Nancy has no other options besides these three.
- **D**: Partially correct but incomplete. While Nancy values studying more than $6, she also values it more than $8, as she chose studying over babysitting.
- **E**: Incorrect. Nancy is not indifferent; she chose studying over both mowing and babysitting.
- **F**: Incorrect. Nancy's choice is not irrational; she may value studying more than the monetary gain from babysitting.
- **G**: Incorrect. If the benefit of studying were less than $8, she would have chosen babysitting instead.
- **H**: Potentially correct. The benefit of studying must be at least $8 (the opportunity cost). However, it is not necessarily "greater than" $8; it could be exactly equal.
- **I**: Correct. The opportunity cost of studying is $8, and the benefit of studying is non-monetary and unmeasurable.
- **J**: Incorrect. If Nancy preferred babysitting to studying, she would have chosen babysitting.

### Conclusion:
The most accurate statement is **I**, as it correctly identifies the opportunity cost ($8) and acknowledges that the benefit of studying is unmeasurable. While **H** is close, it assumes the benefit is "greater than" $8, which is not necessarily true. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**I**
