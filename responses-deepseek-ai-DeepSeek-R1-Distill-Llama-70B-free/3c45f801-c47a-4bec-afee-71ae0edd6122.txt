Okay, so I need to figure out which option would cause the greatest decrease in real GDP. Hmm, I remember that real GDP is affected by fiscal policy, which involves government spending and taxation. Let's think about how each action influences the economy.

First, I should recall the basic concepts. When the government spends money, it injects funds into the economy, which can boost demand and production. Taxes, on the other hand, take money out of people's pockets, which can reduce their spending power and thus potentially slow down the economy.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Government decreases spending and taxes. So, less spending might reduce demand, but lower taxes mean people have more money to spend. It's a bit of a mix. The effect might be a balance between the two, but I'm not sure which effect is stronger.

Option B: Spending and taxes are constant. So no change. Unlikely to cause a big decrease in GDP.

Option C: Spending decreases, taxes decrease. Similar to A. Lower spending could slow the economy, but lower taxes might stimulate it. Maybe the net effect is small or even positive.

Option D: Taxes decrease, spending same. Lower taxes mean more disposable income for people. They might spend more, which could actually increase GDP, not decrease. So this probably isn't the right answer.

Option E: Spending constant, taxes increase. Higher taxes take money away from consumers and businesses. Less spending could lead to lower demand and production, decreasing GDP. This seems like a possibility.

Option F: Both spending and taxes increase. Higher spending adds to the economy, but higher taxes take away. The net effect depends on which is larger. If spending increases more than taxes, GDP might go up. If taxes increase more, GDP could go down. But the question is which option is the greatest decrease. Not sure yet.

Option G: Spending increases and taxes increase equally. Similar to F. If they match, maybe the effect is neutral? Or perhaps the tax increase offsets the spending, leading to a smaller impact on GDP. Not the biggest decrease.

Option H: Taxes increase, no spending change. So higher taxes could reduce consumption and investment, leading to lower GDP. This seems significant. Like option E, but in E, spending is constant, here it's the same. Wait, E is spending constant, taxes up. So same as H. Wait, no: E says "holds spending constant while increasing taxes" â€” same as H. So actually, E and H are the same? Wait, no. Let me check. Option E: holds spending, increases taxes. Option H: increases taxes, spending no change. So yes, E and H are the same. Oh wait, no, looking back: E is holding spending constant and increasing taxes. H is increasing taxes with no increase in spending. So same as E. Hmm, so E and H are same? Or is there a typo? Because that would mean both options suggest the same policy. But the options are distinct, so perhaps not.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me reread the options.

Option E: Holds spending constant while increasing taxes. So spending same, taxes up. So same as H: increases taxes, spending no change. Wait, that's the same. So perhaps the options have duplicates. But the way they're worded might be different. Maybe I should consider them as separate for now.

Option I: Increases spending, no tax increase. More spending would boost GDP, so this would increase, not decrease, so not the answer.

Option J: Decreases spending, no tax change. So lower spending could reduce demand, leading to lower GDP. So this is a possibility. But how does it compare to options E and H?

Now, to compare which action would have the largest negative effect on GDP.

In Keynesian economics, government spending has a larger multiplier effect than taxes. Because when the government spends, it directly adds to aggregate demand, whereas tax changes affect disposable income, which has a smaller multiplier. So a decrease in government spending would have a bigger negative impact than an increase in taxes.

Wait, but Option J is a decrease in spending. So that would directly lower GDP. Similarly, options E and H involve increasing taxes, which would lower disposable income and lead to less consumption, thus lower GDP.

Which one has a bigger impact? Decreasing spending (J) or increasing taxes (E/H)?

In the Keynesian model, the spending multiplier is higher than the tax multiplier. So a change in spending has a larger effect than a change in taxes. So if the government decreases spending, that would have a bigger impact than increasing taxes.

Wait, but let me think again. If the government decreases spending by X, that's a direct reduction in demand. If it increases taxes by X, that reduces disposable income, which reduces consumption but not as much as the direct spending cut.

So, for example, a $100 decrease in spending leads to a larger drop in GDP than a $100 tax increase. So a decrease in spending (like J) would have a bigger effect on lowering GDP than a tax increase (E or H).

But wait, let's see the options again. Option I is increasing spending, so that's good for GDP. Option J is decreasing spending, which is bad. So in J, the government spends less, which directly lowers GDP.

So among the options, which ones decrease GDP the most.

Option J: Decreases spending with no tax change.

Option H: Increases taxes with no spending change.

Which would cause a bigger decrease in GDP? If the spending multiplier is 1.5 and the tax multiplier is about 0.5 (just hypothetical numbers), then a $100 spending decrease would reduce GDP by 150, while a $100 tax increase would reduce it by 50.

So, in that case, J would be worse.

But wait, what about option A? It's a decrease in both spending and taxes. How would that affect things? Lower spending is bad, lower taxes are good. Depending on the amounts, it could be a net negative or positive. But the options don't specify the amounts, so I have to assume the changes are similar in magnitude.

Wait, the question is about the greatest decrease in real GDP. So the option that most likely produces the largest drop.

So if the option with a spending decrease and no tax change (J) leads to a larger drop than a tax increase with no spending change (H or E), then J is the answer.

Alternatively, another approach: consider the balanced budget theorem. A balanced budget increase (spending up, taxes up equally) has a neutral effect. But in this case, a reduction in spending without a tax cut would have a contractionary effect.

So, considering all this, the biggest decrease would be from the option that reduces government spending without a corresponding tax cut, because the multiplier effect is larger.

So looking at the options, option J is 'government decreases spending with no change in taxes.' That would lead to a significant decrease in GDP.

Alternatively, option E and H are about increasing taxes with constant spending. That would also decrease GDP but perhaps less so than J.

So the greatest decrease is most likely option J.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me think about the various fiscal policy impacts. A decrease in government spending directly reduces aggregate demand. An increase in taxes reduces disposable income, which can lead to lower consumption. So the size of the impact depends on the multipliers.

In Keynesian economics, the government spending multiplier is larger (e.g., 2 or more) than the tax multiplier (e.g., around 1.5 or lower). So a $1 decrease in spending could decrease GDP by $2, while a $1 tax increase might only decrease GDP by $1.50.

So if options J and E involve the same amount of change (let's say both are a $100 change), then J would cause a $200 decrease in GDP, while E would cause a $150 decrease. So J is worse.

But wait, the options don't specify the magnitude; they just indicate the direction. So perhaps the question expects us to think in terms of direction only.

Alternatively, some might think that increasing taxes reduces demand, but perhaps not as much as cutting spending, especially if the spending is on goods and services.

So, putting it all together, the greatest decrease in real GDP would be caused by a decrease in government spending without a tax cut, which is option J.

Alternatively, another approach is to think about the AD-AS model. A decrease in government spending shifts the AD curve to the left. An increase in taxes also shifts AD left, but perhaps not as much as a spending decrease.

So, the largest left shift (greatest decrease in AD) would be from a spending decrease. So option J.

Therefore, the correct answer is J.

To determine which option is most likely to create the greatest decrease in real GDP, we analyze the effects of government spending and taxation on aggregate demand. Government spending directly injects funds into the economy, while taxes reduce disposable income, indirectly affecting consumption. The Keynesian model suggests that government spending has a larger multiplier effect than taxes, meaning changes in spending have a more significant impact on GDP.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A**: Decreasing both spending and taxes combines a contractionary effect (lower spending) with a stimulatory effect (lower taxes). The net impact depends on the relative magnitudes of the changes, but it is unlikely to cause the greatest decrease in GDP.
2. **Option B**: Holding spending and taxes constant results in no change to GDP.
3. **Option C**: Decreasing spending while also decreasing taxes mixes a contractionary effect (lower spending) with a stimulatory effect (lower taxes). The net impact is likely small or even positive.
4. **Option D**: Decreasing taxes while keeping spending constant increases disposable income, which could stimulate the economy and increase GDP, not decrease it.
5. **Option E**: Holding spending constant while increasing taxes reduces disposable income, leading to lower consumption and a decrease in GDP. However, the tax multiplier is smaller than the spending multiplier, so the impact is less severe than a spending decrease.
6. **Option F**: Increasing both spending and taxes could have a net effect that depends on the relative magnitudes of the changes. If spending increases more than taxes, GDP might rise, but if taxes increase more, GDP could fall. This is less likely to cause the greatest decrease in GDP.
7. **Option G**: Increasing spending and taxes equally is likely to have a neutral or smaller impact on GDP, as the effects may offset each other.
8. **Option H**: Increasing taxes with no change in spending reduces disposable income and consumption, leading to a decrease in GDP. However, the tax multiplier is smaller than the spending multiplier, so the impact is less severe than a spending decrease.
9. **Option I**: Increasing spending with no tax increase directly boosts aggregate demand and increases GDP, not decrease it.
10. **Option J**: Decreasing spending with no change in taxes directly reduces aggregate demand and has the largest contractionary effect due to the higher spending multiplier. This is the most likely option to cause the greatest decrease in GDP.

### Conclusion:
The greatest decrease in real GDP is most likely caused by **Option J**, as a decrease in government spending directly reduces aggregate demand, and the spending multiplier has a larger impact than the tax multiplier.
