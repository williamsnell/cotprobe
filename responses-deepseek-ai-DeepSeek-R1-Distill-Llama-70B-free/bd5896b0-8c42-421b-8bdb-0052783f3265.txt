Alright, so I've got this question about Kubler-Ross and the five stages of grief. Hmm, I remember that she proposed these stages as a model of how people cope with their own terminal illness or the loss of a loved one. The stages are Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression, and Acceptance. 

The question is asking about the initial reaction when a terminally ill patient is told about their condition. So, the first stage is Denial. People often can't believe the news. They might feel numb or disbelieving, thinking it's not possible.

Looking at the options provided:

A: “I hate everybody and everything!” That sounds more like Anger, which is the second stage.

B: "Can we negotiate a deal, God?" That's Bargaining, the third stage.

C: “If you help me, God, I’ll reform my life!” Also Bargaining.

D: “No. it’s not possible!” This seems like Denial, the first reaction.

E: “I give up: I'm powerless!” That's more Depression, the fourth stage.

F: "I don't believe in terminal illnesses." Also Denial, but maybe not the most direct expression.

G: "I'm not scared, I'm ready." That's Acceptance, the fifth stage.

H: "I knew this was coming." Maybe some people expect it, but not the typical initial Denial.

I: "I'll fight this and win." That's more like a fighting spirit, perhaps before the stages kick in or during Denial.

J: "Why me? It's not fair!" That could be part of Anger or Bargaining.

So the initial reaction is Denial. Between options D and F. Option D is a direct refusal, like "No, it's not possible!" which is a strong denial. Option F is about not believing in terminal illnesses, which is a bit different. The classic response is "No, this can't be happening," so D seems more accurate.

The initial reaction to being informed of a terminal illness, according to Kubler-Ross's model, is Denial. This stage is characterized by disbelief and a refusal to accept the news. Among the options, D: "No, it’s not possible!" best captures this reaction.

Answer: D
