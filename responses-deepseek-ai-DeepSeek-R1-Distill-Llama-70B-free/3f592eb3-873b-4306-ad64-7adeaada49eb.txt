Okay, so I've got this Python question here: What is the output of 4*1**4 in Python? The options are A through J, with various numbers. Hmm, I need to figure this out.

Wait, I remember that in Python, the order of operations is important. Oh right, it's about operator precedence. So exponentiation comes before multiplication, right? So let's break down the expression 4*1**4.

The ** operator has higher precedence than *, so 1**4 is calculated first. What's 1 to the power of 4? Well, 1 times itself any number of times is always 1. So 1**4 equals 1.

Now the expression is 4*1. That's straightforwardâ€”4 multiplied by 1 is 4. So the output should be 4. Looking at the options, option H is 4. So the answer must be H.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not mixing up the order. Sometimes I confuse whether multiplication comes first before exponentiation, but no, exponentiation is higher. So yes, the calculation is correct.

The expression `4*1**4` is evaluated by first computing the exponentiation `1**4`, which equals 1. Then, multiplying by 4 gives 4. 

Answer: H
