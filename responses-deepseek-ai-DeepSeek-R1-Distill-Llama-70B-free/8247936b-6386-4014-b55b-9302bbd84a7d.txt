Okay, so I've got this problem about a ruby laser beam's diameter when it hits a target. Hmm, alright, let me try to figure this out. I remember that when a laser beam travels, it spreads out due to diffraction. This is called beam divergence, I think. So the initial diameter is given as 14 mm, and the target is 10,000 km away. Oh wait, that's a huge distance. 

Wait, the wavelength is given as 694.3 nm. Right, ruby lasers are red, so that makes sense. So I need to calculate the beam's diameter after traveling that distance. I think the formula involves the wavelength, the initial diameter, and the distance.

I remember something about the beam spreading due to diffraction being described by the formula for the diameter at a certain point. Oh right, the formula is something like D = (4λ L)/(π d), where D is the diameter at distance L, d is the initial diameter, and λ is the wavelength. Or wait, maybe it's D = (λ L)/(π d/2) )? Hmm, I might be mixing up the formula.

Wait, the formula I remember is θ ≈ λ/(π d), where θ is the divergence angle in radians. Oh right, because the beam spreads at a small angle. So the divergence angle is approximately the wavelength divided by the initial beam diameter times π. Wait, no, wait, θ is equal to 1.22λ/(d), but that's for circular apertures. So maybe I should use that.

Wait, actually, the formula for the beam diameter after traveling a distance L is given by D = d + (2θ L). But since θ is small, we can approximate it as D ≈ 2θ L. Because the initial diameter d is much smaller than the spreading over such a large distance.

So θ is 1.22 λ / (d), right? Because for a Gaussian beam, the divergence angle is roughly 1.22 times lambda over the waist diameter. So θ = 1.22λ/(π d) or wait, maybe θ = (2λ)/(π d) * something. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, let's think in terms of formulas. The beam divergence formula is often given as θ = (2λ) / (π d), where θ is in radians. Wait, no, I think the exact formula is θ = (1.22 λ) / (d), where d is the diameter of the aperture. Wait, no, that's for the Airy disk. Oh wait, the angular resolution is about 1.22 λ / (diameter), which is the same as θ for the first minimum. But for a Gaussian beam, I think the divergence is θ ≈ λ/(π w0), where w0 is the beam waist radius.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to find the correct formula. So for a collimated beam, the far-field divergence is given by θ ≈ (1.22 λ) / (d), where d is the beam diameter. Wait, I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, the formula I found in my notes is that the beam's diameter at a distance L is D = d + (2λ L)/(π d). But when L is very large, the second term dominates, so D ≈ (2λ L)/(π d).

Wait, let's try that. So D = (2λ L) / (π d). Let me plug in the numbers.

Given:
λ = 694.3 nm = 694.3e-9 m
d = 14 mm = 0.014 m
L = 10,000 km = 10^7 meters.

So D = (2 * 694.3e-9 m * 1e7 m) / (π * 0.014 m).

Calculating numerator: 2 * 694.3e-9 * 1e7 = 2 * 694.3e-2 = 2 * 6.943 = approx 13.886.

Denominator: π * 0.014 ≈ 3.1416 * 0.014 ≈ 0.04398.

So D ≈ 13.886 / 0.04398 ≈ let's calculate that.

13.886 / 0.04398 ≈ approximately 315.7 meters?

Wait, but looking at the options, the answers are in the 1000-2000 meters range. Hmm, that's way off. Did I make a mistake in units?

Wait, wait. Let's double-check the units.

λ is in meters, L in meters, d in meters. So all units are consistent.

Wait, let me compute the numerator again. 2 * 694.3e-9 m * 1e7 m = 2 * 694.3e-9 * 1e7 = 2 * 694.3 * 1e-2 = 2 * 6.943 = 13.886 meters. Wait, no: 694.3e-9 m is 6.943e-7 m. So 2 * 6.943e-7 m * 1e7 m = 2 * 6.943e0 = 13.886 m.

Denominator: π * 0.014 m ≈ 0.04398 m.

So 13.886 / 0.04398 ≈ 315.7 meters. But that's not matching any of the options. What did I do wrong?

Wait, maybe I used the wrong formula. Maybe the formula is D = (4 λ L) / (π d).

Let's try that. So D = (4 λ L) / (π d).

Plugging the same numbers:

4 * 694.3e-9 m * 1e7 m = 4 * 6.943e-2 = 0.2777 m.

Divide by (π * 0.014) ≈ 0.04398 m.

0.2777 / 0.04398 ≈ approx 6.31 meters. No, that's even smaller. Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, perhaps I have the formula wrong. Another approach: using the formula for the spot size after a distance z. For a Gaussian beam, the spot size w(z) is given by w(z) = w0 * sqrt(1 + (z/z_R)^2 ), where z_R is the Rayleigh range.

The Rayleigh range z_R is (π w0^2)/λ. Wait, but w0 is the beam waist (radius), so if the initial diameter is d, then w0 is d/2.

So z_R = π (d/2)^2 / λ.

Then, the spot size at distance z is w(z) = (d/2) * sqrt(1 + (z/(z_R))^2 )

At z much larger than z_R, this approximates to w(z) ≈ (d/2) * (z/(z_R)) )

Substituting z_R = π (d/2)^2 / λ,

w(z) ≈ (d/2) * [ z / (π (d/2)^2 / λ) ) ]

Simplify:

= (d/2) * [ z * λ / ( π (d^2/4) ) ) ]

= (d/2) * [ (4 z λ ) / ( π d^2 ) ) ]

= [ (d/2) * 4 z λ ) ] / ( π d^2 )

= (2 z λ ) / ( π d )

So the spot diameter D would be twice that, so D = (4 z λ ) / ( π d )

Wait, so that's the same as the formula I tried earlier. So D=(4λL)/(π d)

Wait, but when I did that earlier, I got 6.31 meters, which isn't matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's recompute.

λ = 694.3 nm = 694.3e-9 m.

z= L=1e4 km =1e7 m.

d=14 mm=0.014 m.

D=(4 * λ * z )/( π * d )

So:

4 * 694.3e-9 m * 1e7 m = 4 * 694.3e-2 m = 4 * 6.943e-0 m = 27.772 m.

Wait, 694.3e-9 * 1e7 is 694.3e-2 = 6.943 m. Because 1e7 is 1e7, and 694.3e-9 *1e7 = 694.3e-2 = 6.943 m.

So 4 * 6.943 = 27.772 m.

Divide by π * 0.014 m.

π is approx 3.1416, so 3.1416 * 0.014 = 0.04398 m.

So D=27.772 / 0.04398 ≈ let's calculate.

27.772 / 0.04398 ≈ let's see.

Calculate 27772 / 439.8 ≈ (approx) 27772 ÷ 440.

440 * 63 = 27720.

So 63 with a remainder of 52. So approximately 63.1.

Wait, so D ≈ 63.1 * 0.1 ? Because 0.04398 is 4.398e-2.

Wait, wait, the actual calculation is 27.772 / 0.04398.

Wait, 0.04398 is approximately 0.044.

27.772 / 0.044 = ?

Well, 0.044 * 630 = 27.72.

So 27.772 /0.044 ≈ 630. So D≈630 meters.

But looking at the options, the closest is option I:1310 m, or E:1410, or H:1000. None are 630. So I'm still missing something.

Wait, maybe I used the wrong formula. Maybe the formula is D= (2 λ L )/( π d )

Wait, let's try that.

(2 * 694.3e-9 m *1e7 m ) / ( π *0.014 m )

So numerator: 2 * 694.3e-9 *1e7 = 2 * 6.943e-2 = 0.13886 m.

Denominator: 3.1416 * 0.014 ≈ 0.04398.

So 0.13886 / 0.04398 ≈ approx 3.157 meters. That's way too small.

Wait, that's conflicting with the earlier approach. I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look up the correct formula.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the beam diameter at a large distance L is D = (4 λ L )/( π d )

But according to that, I'm getting 630 meters, but the options don't have that. What's wrong here?

Wait, let me double-check the numbers.

λ = 694.3 nm = 694.3e-9 m.

L = 10,000 km = 10^7 meters.

d =14 mm =0.014 m.

So 4 * 694.3e-9 *1e7 = 4 * 6.943e-2 = 0.27772 m.

Wait, wait, no: 694.3e-9 m is 6.943e-7 m. So 4 * 6.943e-7 m *1e7 m = 4 *6.943e0 m = 27.772 m.

Divide by (π * 0.014) ≈ 0.04398 m.

So 27.772 / 0.04398 ≈ 630 m. Hmm, but the options don't have this. So maybe I'm missing a factor, like the factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the formula is D = (2 λ L )/( π d ), but that gave me 3.15 m, which doesn't fit either.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the radius first and then double it. Let me check.

Wait, in the formula D = (4 λ L )/( π d ), if I get 630 m, but the options are way larger. Maybe I messed up the exponents.

Wait, 694.3e-9 m is 6.943e-7 m. So 4 * 6.943e-7 m *1e7 m = 4 *6.943e0 m = 27.772 m. That's correct.

Divide by (π * 0.014) ≈ 0.04398 m. 27.772 /0.04398 ≈ 631 m.

Hmm, but the options are all over 1000 m. So perhaps the formula is different.

Another approach: Maybe the formula uses the initial radius, not diameter.

Wait, let me think. In the formula D=4λL/(π d), d is the initial diameter. But perhaps I should use the radius? Let's see.

If d is the initial diameter, then the radius is d/2. So perhaps the formula should be D= (4 λ L )/( π (d/2) ) ) = (8 λ L )/( π d )

Wait, that would make the diameter larger. Let's compute that.

So D= (8 * 694.3e-9 m *1e7 m ) / ( π * 0.014 m )

Numerator:8 * 6.943e-7 m *1e7 =8 *6.943e0 = 55.544 m.

Denominator: 0.04398 m.

So 55.544 /0.04398 ≈ 1263 m.

Wait, that's approximately 1260 meters. Looking at the options, option B is 1210 m, option I is 1310 m, option E is 1410 m. 1263 is closest to option B:1210 or option I:1310, but perhaps more precise calculation would get closer.

Wait, let me compute more accurately.

Compute numerator:8 * 694.3e-9 *1e7 = 8 * 694.3 *1e-2 = 8 *6.943 = 55.544.

Denominator: π *0.014 = 0.0439823.

So 55.544 /0.0439823 ≈ let me compute this.

55.544 ÷ 0.0439823.

Well, 0.0439823 * 1260 ≈ 55.44.

So 55.544 / 0.0439823 ≈ 1262.5 meters.

Looking at the options, the closest is option E:1410 m, option I:1310, but none exactly. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the formula is D = (2 * 1.22 * λ * L) / (d). Because 1.22 is the factor from the Airy disk.

So 1.22 * λ * 2 L / d.

So D = (2.44 * λ * L ) / d.

Plugging in the numbers:

λ=694.3e-9 m, L=1e7 m, d=0.014 m.

2.44 * 694.3e-9 * 1e7 = 2.44 * 6.943e-2 = 0.1694 m.

Divide by 0.014 m: 0.1694 /0.014 ≈ 12.1 m. That's way too small. So that doesn't fit.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should think about this differently.

The formula I derived earlier is D = (4 λ L )/( π d ), which gives 630 m, but that's not in the options. But when I considered using radius instead of diameter, I got 1262 m, which is close to option B (1210) or I (1310).

Wait, perhaps the formula uses diameter correctly, but I miscalculated somewhere.

Wait, let me re-calculate D = (4 * 694.3e-9 m * 1e7 m ) / ( π * 0.014 m )

Wait, 4 * 694.3e-9 *1e7=4 * 694.3e-2 = 4 *6.943=27.772 m.

Divide by (π *0.014)=0.04398 m.

So 27.772 / 0.04398 = let me compute it more accurately.

0.04398 * 630 = 27.9304. But 27.772 is a little less than that.

So 630 * 0.04398 = 27.7308.

27.772 is 27.772-27.7308=0.0412 higher.

0.0412 /0.04398 ≈ ~0.938.

So 630 + (0.938) ≈ 630.938. So about 631 meters.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the initial approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses the beam's waist as radius, and the formula for the beam spread is D = 2 * (λ L )/( π r ), where r is the initial radius.

So initial radius r = 0.014 m / 2 = 0.007 m.

Then D = 2*(694.3e-9 *1e7 )/( π *0.007 )

Compute numerator: 2 * 694.3e-9 *1e7 = 2 *6.943e-2 = 0.13886 m.

Denominator: π *0.007 ≈ 0.0219911 m.

So 0.13886 /0.0219911 ≈ approx 6.315 meters. No, that's even smaller.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is D = (λ * L )/(d ). Let's try that.

So 694.3e-9 m *1e7 m = 6.943e-2 m.

Divide by d=0.014 m: 6.943e-2 / 0.014 ≈ 0.495 m. No, that's too small.

I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should find another way. Let's think about the formula again.

Wait, the formula for the divergence angle θ is θ ≈ λ/(π d), where d is the initial diameter. So θ = 694.3e-9 / (π *0.014 )

Compute θ: 694.3e-9 / (0.04398) ≈ approx 1.578e-5 radians.

Then, the diameter D after distance L is D = d + 2 θ L.

But since L is very large, D ≈ 2 θ L.

So D ≈ 2 * 1.578e-5 rad * 1e7 m.

2 *1.
