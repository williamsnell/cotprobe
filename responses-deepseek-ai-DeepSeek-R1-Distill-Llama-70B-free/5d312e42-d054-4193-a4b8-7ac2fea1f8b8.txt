Okay, so I've got this question about the electromagnetic spectrum, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is asking which part has the shortest wavelength. The options are from A to J, with each being a different type of wave.

Hmm, I remember that the electromagnetic spectrum is arranged from waves with the longest wavelengths to the shortest. Or wait, is it the other way around? Oh right, I think it starts with radio waves which have longer wavelengths and then moves to shorter ones as it goes on. So the order goes something like: radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and then gamma rays. So gamma rays must be on the very end with the shortest wavelengths.

Wait, let me think again. I remember that wavelength and frequency are inversely relatedâ€”higher frequency means shorter wavelength. So gamma rays have really high frequency, which means their wavelengths are super short. So they should be the ones with the shortest.

Looking at the options, H is Gamma rays. So the answer should be H. Let me make sure I didn't mix up any others. For example, ultraviolet is before X-rays, which are before gamma. So their wavelengths are longer than gamma but shorter than visible light.

Another way to remember is that in the visible spectrum, we have colors, but beyond that, UV is not visible but has shorter than visible. Then X-rays are used in medical imaging because they can pass through tissues, and gamma rays are even more energetic. So yeah, gamma rays have the shortest.

The electromagnetic spectrum is arranged from longer wavelengths to shorter ones. Gamma rays are at the end with the highest frequency and shortest wavelength. 

Answer: H
