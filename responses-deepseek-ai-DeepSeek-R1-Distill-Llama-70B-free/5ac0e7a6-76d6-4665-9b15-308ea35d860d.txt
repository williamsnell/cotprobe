Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and ensembles. Let me break down what each statement is saying and see if I can determine their truthfulness.

Statement 1 says that CIFAR-10 classification performance for CNNs can exceed 95%. I remember that CIFAR-10 is a common benchmark dataset with 10 classes. From what I've read before, CNNs have been really successful on image classification tasks. I think models like ResNet or maybe even some older ones like VGG have achieved high accuracies. Wait, does it really go above 95%? I recall that the state-of-the-art might be around that. For example, some papers mention models achieving over 95% accuracy on CIFAR-10. So I'm leaning towards Statement 1 being True.

Now, Statement 2 claims that ensembles of neural networks don't improve classification accuracy because the representations they learn are highly correlated. Hmm, ensembles usually combine multiple models to improve performance. But if the models are too similar, their errors might be correlated, which means ensembling might not help much. However, I remember that techniques like bagging or using different initializations can lead to more diverse models, which do improve accuracy when ensembled. So I think Statement 2 is False.

Putting it together: Statement 1 is True, Statement 2 is False. So the correct option should be the one where the first is True and the second is False. Looking at the options, that's option C: True, False.

Wait, just to double-check. Do ensembles really not improve accuracy? I think they do, especially when the models are diverse. So if the statement says they don't improve, that's wrong. So yes, I'm confident that Statement 2 is False.

The question evaluates the truthfulness of two statements about convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and ensembles. 

- **Statement 1** asserts that CIFAR-10 classification performance for CNNs can exceed 95%. This is accurate, as advanced CNN architectures like ResNet have achieved state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, surpassing 95% accuracy. Thus, Statement 1 is **True**.

- **Statement 2** claims that ensembles of neural networks do not improve classification accuracy due to highly correlated representations. This is incorrect because ensembles, especially when models are diverse (e.g., through different initializations or architectures), often enhance performance by reducing error variance. Therefore, Statement 2 is **False**.

Given that Statement 1 is True and Statement 2 is False, the correct answer is **C: True, False**.
