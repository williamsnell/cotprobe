Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem about equilibrium constants. Let me read the question again carefully.

The reaction is Br2(g) + Cl2(g) ↔ BrCl(g), and the equilibrium constant is 15.0 at a certain temperature. We start with 10.0 grams of BrCl in a 15.0-liter vessel. We need to find the concentration of BrCl at equilibrium.

Hmm, right. So the first thing I need to do is probably find the initial concentration of BrCl. Since we have the mass and the volume, that should be straightforward.

Wait, the molar mass of BrCl. Bromine is about 80 g/mol and chlorine is 35.5 g/mol. So 80 + 35.5 equals 115.5 g/mol. Right, so 10 grams divided by 115.5 g/mol gives the moles. Let me calculate that. 10 / 115.5 is approximately 0.0867 moles. Then, since the volume is 15 liters, the concentration is 0.0867 /15, which is about 0.00578 M. So that's the initial concentration of BrCl.

Wait, but wait. The reaction equation: when Br2 and Cl2 form BrCl, the stoichiometry is 1:1:2? Or 1:1:1? Let me check. The equation is Br2 + Cl2 → 2 BrCl. Oh wait, no, the question says BrCl(g) is formed, so the correct balanced equation is Br2 + Cl2 ↔ 2 BrCl. Oh wait, no, wait another look. The problem says the reaction is Br2(g) with Cl2(g) to form BrCl(g). So the equation is Br2 + Cl2 → 2 BrCl. So the stoichiometric coefficients are important here.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the equation is written as forming BrCl, so it's written as Br2 + Cl2 → BrCl. But that's not balanced. Oh wait, perhaps the given equation is actually written incorrectly. Let me think. Because Br2 plus Cl2 would give two moles of BrCl. So the correct balanced equation is Br2(g) + Cl2(g) ↔ 2 BrCl(g). So the K expression would be [BrCl]^2 / ([Br2][Cl2]) = 15.

But wait, the problem states that the equilibrium constant is 15.0. So assuming the reaction is written correctly as Br2 + Cl2 → BrCl, but that's not balanced. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction as written is Br2 + Cl2 → 2 BrCl, making K equal to [BrCl]^2/([Br2][Cl2]) =15.

But wait, the way the problem is written might not explicitly state the stoichiometry. Hmm, the problem says the reaction is Br2(g) with Cl2(g) to form BrCl(g), which I think implies the equation is Br2 + Cl2 → 2 BrCl. So I'll proceed with that.

Now, the initial concentration of BrCl is 0.00578 M (from 10g/15L). But wait, the initial conditions for Br2 and Cl2 are zero because the problem says we're starting with BrCl. No, wait, no. Wait, the problem says "the reaction" of Br2 with Cl2 to form BrCl. So if we're starting with BrCl, that's the product, and the reaction will proceed in reverse. Because at equilibrium, some BrCl will decompose into Br2 and Cl2.

Wait wait, wait. Let me think again. The reaction as written is Br2 + Cl2 → 2 BrCl, with K=15. So if we start with some BrCl and no Br2 and Cl2, the system will adjust by BrCl decomposing into Br2 and Cl2 until equilibrium is reached.

So the ICE table setup would be:

Initial:
[BrCl] = 0.00578 M
[Br2] = 0
[Cl2] = 0

Change:
Let x be the amount of BrCl that decomposes. So for every 2 moles of BrCl decomposed, you get 1 mole of Br2 and 1 mole of Cl2. Wait, no. Let me think about the stoichiometry. If the reaction is Br2 + Cl2 → 2 BrCl, then the reverse reaction is 2 BrCl → Br2 + Cl2. So for every 2 moles of BrCl that decompose, you get 1 mole of Br2 and 1 mole of Cl2.

So change would be:
[BrCl] decreases by 2x
[Br2] increases by x
[Cl2] increases by x.

So at equilibrium:
[BrCl] = 0.00578 - 2x
[Br2] = x
[Cl2] = x

Now, the equilibrium expression is K = [BrCl]^2 / ([Br2][Cl2]) = 15.

Wait, no. Because the reaction is written as Br2 + Cl2 → 2 BrCl, so K_forward is [BrCl]^2 / ([Br2][Cl2]) =15. But if the reaction is proceeding in reverse (because we have product turning into reactants), we're considering the reverse reaction, which has K_reverse = 1/K_forward = 1/15.

Wait, that's a good point. So the reverse reaction's K is 1/15. So when we set up the ICE table, the reaction is 2 BrCl → Br2 + Cl2, with K = 1/15.

So the K expression would be [Br2][Cl2]/[BrCl]^2 = 1/15.

Wait, that's correct because when you reverse the reaction, you take the reciprocal of K. So now, the setup is:

K_reverse = (x * x) / ( (0.00578 - 2x)^2 ) ) = 1/15.

So the equation becomes:

x² / (0.00578 - 2x)^2 = 1/15.

Taking square roots on both sides,

x/(0.00578 - 2x) = 1/√15.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps it's easier to write the equation without square roots. Let me think.

Wait, let me proceed:

x² / ( (0.00578 - 2x)^2 ) = 1/15 → 15 x² = (0.00578 - 2x)^2.

Taking square roots on both sides would give sqrt(15) x = 0.00578 - 2x. Alternatively, maybe I can expand the right-hand side.

Let me compute 15 x² = (0.00578 - 2x)^2.

Expand the right side: (0.00578)^2 - 2*(0.00578)*(2x) + (2x)^2.

Which is 0.0000334 (approx, since 0.00578^2 is about 0.0000334) - 0.02312 x + 4x².

So 15x² = 0.0000334 - 0.02312 x + 4x².

Bring all terms to left:

15x² -4x² +0.02312 x -0.0000334=0.

11x² + 0.02312 x - 0.0000334 =0.

Hmm, that's a quadratic equation in x. Let me write it as:

11x² + 0.02312 x - 0.0000334 = 0.

The coefficients are a=11, b=0.02312, c=-0.0000334.

We can use the quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)]/(2a).

Compute discriminant D = b² -4ac.

b² = (0.02312)^2 ≈ 0.000535.

4ac =4 * 11 * (-0.0000334) = 4 * 11 * (-3.34e-5) ≈ 4 * (-3.674e-4) ≈ -1.47e-3.

Wait, but since c is negative, 4ac is 4*11*(-3.34e-5) → 44*(-3.34e-5) = -0.00014736.

So D = 0.000535 - (4ac) → but wait, 4ac is negative, so -4ac is positive. So D = 0.000535 + 0.00014736 = 0.00068236.

Square root of D is sqrt(0.00068236) ≈ 0.02612.

So x = [ -0.02312 ± 0.02612 ] / (2*11).

Compute both possibilities.

First, the plus case:

( -0.02312 + 0.02612 ) / 22 = (0.003) /22 ≈ 0.00013636.

Second, the minus case:

( -0.02312 -0.02612 ) /22 → (-0.04924)/22 ≈ -0.002238.

But x represents a concentration, so it can't be negative. So x ≈ 0.00013636 M.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. Because when I write 15x² = (0.00578 - 2x)^2, perhaps I should take square roots to make it easier. Let me try that approach.

Take square roots of both sides: sqrt(15) x = 0.00578 - 2x.

Wait, but wait, when taking square roots, technically, both sides could be positive or negative, but since concentrations are positive, we'll consider the positive roots.

So sqrt(15) is about 3.87298.

So equation:

3.87298 x = 0.00578 - 2x.

Bring 2x to the left: (3.87298 + 2) x = 0.00578.

That's 5.87298 x = 0.00578 → x = 0.00578 /5.87298 ≈ 0.000984 M.

Wait, that's different from the earlier result. So which is correct?

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in expanding earlier. Wait, let's see. Let me recast the equation.

We have 15 x² = (0.00578 - 2x)^2.

Take square roots:

sqrt(15) x = 0.00578 - 2x.

Because both sides are positive, I can ignore the negative root.

So sqrt(15) = ~3.87298.

So 3.87298 x = 0.00578 - 2x.

Bring 2x to the left:

3.87298x + 2x = 0.00578 → 5.87298 x = 0.00578 → x ≈ 0.00578 /5.87298.

Let me compute that:

0.00578 ÷ 5.87298: Let's approximate.

5.87298 is approximately 5.873. 0.00578 ÷5.873 → Let me compute 5.78e-3 /5.873 → approximately 0.000984 M.

So x ≈ 0.000984 M.

Wait, that's about 9.84e-4 M.

But earlier, when I solved the quadratic equation, I got x ≈ 0.000136 M, which is about 1.36e-4. But that's a big discrepancy. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in expanding (0.00578 -2x)^2. Let me compute it again.

(0.00578 - 2x)^2 = (0.00578)^2 - 2*(0.00578)*(2x) + (2x)^2 → 0.0000334 - 0.02312 x +4x².

Yes, that's correct.

So 15x² = 0.0000334 -0.02312x +4x² → 15x² -4x² +0.02312x -0.0000334 =0 → 11x² +0.02312x -0.0000334=0.

Wait, so the quadratic equation approach should be correct. But why am I getting a different result when taking square roots?

Ah, because when I take square roots, I'm assuming that the equation is sqrt(15)x = 0.00578 -2x. But perhaps that's not valid because when taking square roots, the equation becomes (sqrt(15)x)^2 = (0.00578 -2x)^2, which is why it's the same as the original equation. So the square root approach should also be correct, leading to x ≈ 0.000984 M.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the quadratic approach. Let me recalculate the quadratic solution.

So with a=11, b=0.02312, c=-0.0000334.

Discriminant D = b^2 -4ac.

b^2: (0.02312)^2 = 0.000535.

4ac =4 *11*(-0.0000334) = 44 * (-0.0000334) = -0.0014736.

So D = 0.000535 - ( -0.0014736 ) = 0.000535 + 0.0014736 = 0.0020086.

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake earlier in calculating 4ac.

Because 4ac =4 *11 * (-0.0000334) = 44 * (-0.0000334) = -0.0014736.

So b² -4ac = 0.000535 - (-0.0014736) = 0.000535 +0.0014736= 0.0020086.

So sqrt(D) = sqrt(0.0020086)= approx 0.0448.

So x = [ -b ± sqrt(D) ]/(2a).

So x = [ -0.02312 ±0.0448 ]/(22).

So two solutions:

1. (-0.02312 +0.0448 ) /22 → (0.02168)/22 ≈ 0.000985.

2. (-0.02312 -0.0448)/22 → (-0.06792)/22 ≈ -0.003086.

Discard the negative solution, so x ≈ 0.000985 M.

Ah, okay, so that's the same as the square root approach. Earlier, I must have miscalculated the 4ac term as positive when it's actually negative.

So x ≈ 0.000985 M.

Now, we can find the equilibrium concentration of BrCl.

BrCl's concentration is initial minus 2x: 0.00578 - 2*(0.000985) → 0.00578 - 0.00197 = 0.00381 M.

Wait, but let me compute that accurately.

0.00578 is equal to 5.78e-3.

2x is 2 * 0.000985 = 0.00197.

Subtracting: 5.78e-3 -1.97e-3 =3.81e-3 M.

So [BrCl] at equilibrium is 0.00381 M.

Looking at the options, I see option F is 4.5e-3, which is higher than 0.00381. Option I is 3.8e-3, which is close.

Wait, let me compute more accurately.

0.00578 - 2*(0.000984) → 0.00578 - 0.001968 = 0.003812 M.

So 3.812e-3 M, which is approximately 3.8e-3 M.

Looking at the options, option I is 3.8 ×10^-3 mol/L, which is 0.0038 M. So that's the closest.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the stoichiometry.

Wait, the reaction is written as Br2 + Cl2 ↔ 2 BrCl, so K_forward is [BrCl]^2/([Br2][Cl2]) =15.

We started with BrCl, so the reaction goes in reverse, so K_reverse is 1/15.

So the ICE table is correct, and the setup is correct.

Wait, but another approach: Let me let the change be 'x', where 2x is the decrease in BrCl, and x increases in Br2 and Cl2.

So [BrCl] = 0.00578 - 2x.

[Br2] = x.

[Cl2] =x.

So K_reverse = (x^2) / (0.00578 - 2x)^2 = 1/15.

Which gives x^2 = (0.00578 -2x)^2 /15.

Taking square roots: x = (0.00578 - 2x)/sqrt(15).

Which gives x*sqrt(15) = 0.00578 - 2x.

Bring 2x to the left: x (sqrt(15) +2 ) = 0.00578.

So x = 0.00578 / (sqrt(15) +2).

Compute sqrt(15)=3.87298, so denominator is 5.87298.

x=0.00578 /5.87298 ≈ 0.000984 M.

So [BrCl] = 0.00578 - 2*(0.000984)= 0.00578 - 0.001968= 0.003812 M, which is 3.812e-3 M.

So that's approximately 3.8e-3 M.

Looking at the options, option I is 3.8 ×10^-3 mol/L, which matches.

So the correct answer should be I.
</think>

To solve the problem, we start by calculating the initial concentration of BrCl. The molar mass of BrCl is calculated as:

\[
\text{Molar mass of BrCl} = 80 \, (\text{Br}) + 35.5 \, (\text{Cl}) = 115.5 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]

Given 10.0 grams of BrCl in a 15.0-liter vessel, the number of moles of BrCl is:

\[
\text{Moles of BrCl} = \frac{10.0}{115.5} \approx 0.0867 \, \text{mol}.
\]

The initial concentration of BrCl is:

\[
[\text{BrCl}] = \frac{0.0867}{15.0} \approx 0.00578 \, \text{M}.
\]

The reaction is:

\[
\text{Br}_2(g) + \text{
