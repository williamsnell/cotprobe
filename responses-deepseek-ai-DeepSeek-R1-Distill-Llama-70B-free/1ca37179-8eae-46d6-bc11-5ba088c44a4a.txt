Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question here about a college freshman's exam scores and figuring out where his performance was best. Hmm, I need to think through this carefully.

So the student got scores in four subjects: English, math, chemistry, and history. The scores are 150, 100, 55, and 30 respectively. But wait, each of these exams has their own mean and standard deviation. I remember that to compare performance across different tests, it's better to use z-scores because they standardize the scores relative to each test's average and spread.

Let me list out the data first:

English: Score 150, mean 125, SD 20.
Math: Score 100, mean 90, SD 10.
Chemistry: Score 55, mean 45, SD 5.
History: Score 30, mean 30, SD 5.

Right, the z-score is calculated as (score - mean)/standard deviation. So for each subject, I'll calculate the z-score to see how many standard deviations away from the mean the student's score is.

Starting with English:
z = (150 - 125)/20 = 25/20 = 1.25. So that's 1.25 standard deviations above the mean. That's pretty good.

Math:
z = (100 - 90)/10 = 10/10 = 1.0. So one standard deviation above. Also good, but not as high as English.

Chemistry:
z = (55 - 45)/5 = 10/5 = 2.0. Oh, wait, that's two standard deviations above the mean. That's even higher than English.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I get that right? Because 55 is just 10 points above 45, but the standard deviation is 5, so yeah, 10/5 is 2.0. So that's a higher z-score than English's 1.25.

And History:
z = (30 - 30)/5 = 0/5 = 0. So exactly at the mean. So average performance here.

Hmm, so comparing the z-scores:

English: 1.25
Math: 1.0
Chemistry: 2.0
History: 0

So the highest z-score is Chemistry at 2.0, followed by English at 1.25, then Math at 1.0, and History at 0.

Wait, but the question is asking on which exam was his performance best. So looking at z-scores, Chemistry is the best, followed by English, then Math, then History.

Wait, but looking at the options, I need to see which exams he did best in. Let me check the options again.

Options: The options are A through J. Let me see:

The options are:

A: Math and History
B: math
C: Chemistry and History
D: English and Math
E: All of the above
F: history
G: English
H: chemistry
I: English and History
J: None of the above

So from the z-scores, his best performance is in Chemistry (z=2), then English (1.25), then Math (1.0), and History (0). So his best was Chemistry, but perhaps the question is considering which exams he did better than average or exceptionally.

Wait, but maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. It says, "Based on this information, you can conclude that the young man's test performance was best on which exam?"

So perhaps the question is asking in which subject he performed the best relative to his peers, which is where z-scores come in.

So, his highest z-score is Chemistry, which would mean he did best there. But let me double-check.

Wait, but looking at the raw scores: he scored 150 in English, which is way higher than the mean of 125. But in Chemistry, he scored 55, which is 10 above the mean of 45. But since the standard deviation is smaller (5 vs 20), the z-score ends up higher.

So, the Chemistry exam is where he performed best relative to others.

Then, looking at the options, option H is Chemistry. So the correct answer would be H. But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing any other aspect.

Wait, the options don't include Chemistry alone except for H. Let me check the options again:

Option H is 'chemistry', so that's an option.

But wait, perhaps I should consider whether any other exams also have high z-scores. English is 1.25, which is good, but lower than 2.0. So, the best is Chemistry.

Wait, unless I made a calculation mistake. Let me recalculate each z-score.

English: (150-125)=25. 25/20 = 1.25. Correct.

Math: (100-90)=10. 10/10=1.0. Correct.

Chemistry: (55-45)=10. 10/5=2.0. Correct.

History: (30-30)=0. 0/5=0. Correct.

So yes, the z-scores are correct. So the best performance is Chemistry, so the answer should be H.

But wait, the question asks, "on which exam?" So perhaps the intended answer is H. But let me check the options again.

Looking back, the options are:

A: Math and History
B: math
C: Chemistry and History
D: English and Math
E: All of the above
F: history
G: English
H: chemistry
I: English and History
J: None of the above

So the correct choice is H: chemistry.

To determine where the college freshman performed best, we compare his exam scores relative to the mean and standard deviation of each exam using z-scores. The z-score is calculated as:

\[
z = \frac{\text{score} - \text{mean}}{\text{standard deviation}}
\]

### Calculations:
1. **English**:  
   \[
   z = \frac{150 - 125}{20} = \frac{25}{20} = 1.25
   \]  
   The student scored 1.25 standard deviations above the mean.

2. **Math**:  
   \[
   z = \frac{100 - 90}{10} = \frac{10}{10} = 1.0
   \]  
   The student scored 1.0 standard deviations above the mean.

3. **Chemistry**:  
   \[
   z = \frac{55 - 45}{5} = \frac{10}{5} = 2.0
   \]  
   The student scored 2.0 standard deviations above the mean.

4. **History**:  
   \[
   z = \frac{30 - 30}{5} = \frac{0}{5} = 0
   \]  
   The student scored exactly at the mean.

### Comparison of z-scores:
- **Chemistry**: \( z = 2.0 \) (highest performance relative to the mean and standard deviation).  
- **English**: \( z = 1.25 \).  
- **Math**: \( z = 1.0 \).  
- **History**: \( z = 0 \) (average performance).

### Conclusion:
The student performed best on the **Chemistry** exam, as it has the highest z-score (\( z = 2.0 \)).

### Evaluation of Options:
- **A: Math and History** — Incorrect, as History was average, and Math was not the best.  
- **B: Math** — Incorrect, as Math was not the best.  
- **C: Chemistry and History** — Incorrect, as History was average.  
- **D: English and Math** — Incorrect, as Chemistry was better than both.  
- **E: All of the above** — Incorrect, as not all exams were the best.  
- **F: History** — Incorrect, as History was average.  
- **G: English** — Incorrect, as Chemistry was better.  
- **H: Chemistry** — Correct, as Chemistry had the highest z-score.  
- **I: English and History** — Incorrect, as History was average.  
- **J: None of the above** — Incorrect, as Chemistry was the best.

### Final Answer:
The student's performance was best on the Chemistry exam.
