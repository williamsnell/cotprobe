Okay, so I have this question about days of the week and holidays. Let me think through it step by step. The question is: If Christmas Day is on a Saturday, then the following New Year's Day falls on what day of the week?

Hmm, I remember that Christmas is on December 25th and New Year's is on January 1st. So I need to figure out how many days are between these two dates to determine the day of the week.

Wait, December 25th is a Saturday. Then I need to count the days from December 25th to January 1st. Let's see, December has 31 days, right? So from the 25th to the end of December, that's 31 minus 25, which is 6 days. So December 25th is day 1 (Saturday), then the 26th is Sunday, 27th Monday, 28th Tuesday, 29th Wednesday, 30th Thursday, and the 31st is Friday. So December 31st is a Friday.

Then January 1st comes the next day, which would be Saturday. Wait, but that can't be right because that would mean New Year's Day is on the same day as Christmas, but the options don't have Saturday as the answer except for option F. But wait, let me double-check.

Wait no, I think I made a mistake. Let me recount the days. Starting from December 25th (Saturday) as day 0. So the 26th is Sunday (1), 27th Monday (2), 28th Tuesday (3), 29th Wednesday (4), 30th Thursday (5), 31st Friday (6). So from the 25th to the 31st is 6 days. Then January 1st is the 7th day after Christmas. Since 7 days later is the same day of the week, right? Because a week has 7 days. So if Christmas is Saturday, adding 7 days brings us back to Saturday. So New Year's Day would be Saturday.

Wait, but I thought the options had F as Saturday. Let me check the options again. Oh wait, the options are A: Monday, B: Tuesday, C: Sunday, D: Thursday, E: Friday, F: Saturday, G: Wednesday. So F is Saturday.

But wait, wait a second. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake. Because sometimes when counting days, you have to be careful whether you include the starting day or not. So from December 25th (Saturday) to January 1st, how many days is that? Let's count.

25th: Saturday (Day 0)
26th: Sunday (1)
27th: Monday (2)
28th: Tuesday (3)
29th: Wednesday (4)
30th: Thursday (5)
31st: Friday (6)
January 1st: Saturday (7)

Yes, so 7 days after Saturday is Saturday again. So New Year's Day would be on a Saturday.

Wait, but I thought sometimes when moving from one year to the next, the day might change if there are leap years or something. But wait, no, the day of the week progresses normally each year unless there's a leap day in between. But between December 25th and January 1st, there's no February, so no leap day involved. So the progression is straightforward.

Another way to think about it: Each year, the same date moves one day of the week forward if it's not a leap year. But since we're moving from December to January, the next year's same date is one day ahead. Wait, but in this case, we're moving within the same year transition. So perhaps that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, using modular arithmetic. Each day advances by one each day. So from Dec 25 (Saturday) to Jan 1 is 7 days later. 7 mod 7 is 0, so same day. So Jan 1st is also Saturday.

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer should be F: Saturday.

If Christmas Day is on a Saturday, December 25th, we need to determine the day of the week for the following New Year's Day, January 1st. 

From December 25th to January 1st, there are 7 days. Since the week repeats every 7 days, adding 7 days to Saturday results in the same day of the week. Therefore, January 1st would also fall on a Saturday.

The correct answer is:

F: Saturday

Answer: F
