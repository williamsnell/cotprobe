Question:

Research has shown that people who read a job description written only with male pronouns (e.g., he, his) are more likely to think of an employee as male than people who read a description that uses gender-neutral language (e.g., he or she). This finding is most closely linked to

Options:

A: the linguistic relativity hypothesis.
B: gender schema theory.
C: the social role hypothesis.
D: modeling.

Okay, so I've got this question here about psychology, specifically related to how job descriptions with male pronouns affect people's perceptions. Let me try to break it down.

The question says that when people read a job description using only male pronouns like "he" or "his," they're more likely to imagine the employee as male. On the other hand, when the description uses gender-neutral language like "he or she," people don't have that same bias. The question is asking which psychological concept this finding is linked to, with options from A to D.

Hmm, I remember that there are several theories related to gender and perception. Let me think about each option.

Option A is the linguistic relativity hypothesis. I think that has to do with how the language we speak influences our thoughts. Like, if your language has specific words for colors, you might perceive colors differently. But this question is about pronouns affecting gender perception. I'm not sure if that's directly related to linguistic relativity, which seems more about how language structures thought rather than specific social categories like gender.

Option B is gender schema theory. I remember schema theory from cognitive psychology. A schema is like a mental framework that helps organize information. Gender schemas would be the mental models we have about what it means to be male or female. So when we read something with male pronouns, our gender schema might make us automatically think of the person as male because that's what our schema expects. That sounds relevant here because the pronouns are activating the schema, leading to the perception.

Option C is the social role hypothesis. I'm less familiar with this one, but I think it suggests that the roles people take in society (like different jobs) influence their behavior and perceptions. So maybe if a job is described with male pronouns, people associate it with traditional male roles, thus thinking the employee is male. That could make sense too. But I'm not as sure about this one as I am about gender schema.

Option D is modeling. Modeling is a concept from Bandura's social learning theory, where people learn by observing and imitating others. I don't see a direct link here because the question is about how pronouns affect perceptions, not about observing and imitating behavior.

So putting it together: the finding is about how language (male pronouns) influences gender perception. Gender schema theory explains that we have these mental frameworks (schemas) about gender, and the pronouns activate those schemas, making us think of a male employee. The social role hypothesis might also be related, but I think gender schema is a more direct fit here.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused between B and C. Let me think again. Social role hypothesis might relate more to how societal roles shape our expectations of what's appropriate for each gender. So if the job is described with male pronouns, maybe people assume it's a male-dominated field, thus imagining a male employee. But the question is more about the immediate cognitive effect of pronouns rather than the broader social roles.

Yes, so gender schema theory is about the cognitive structures that organize gender-related information. Using male pronouns would activate the male schema, leading people to think of a male employee. So the answer should be B.

The finding that job descriptions with male pronouns lead people to imagine a male employee is best explained by gender schema theory. This theory posits that people have mental frameworks (schemas) about gender, which influence how they process information. Male pronouns activate the male schema, leading to the perception of the employee as male. While the social role hypothesis could relate to societal expectations of gender roles, gender schema theory more directly addresses the cognitive process of how pronouns shape gender perception.
