Okay, so I've got this question about the managerial revolution and John Scott's argument from 1997. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that the managerial revolution is a concept related to the separation of ownership and control in businesses. It suggests that managers, rather than owners, are taking over the control of companies. I think this was discussed by people like Berle and Means in their 1932 book "The Modern Corporation and Private Property," where they argued that ownership (shareholders) and management were becoming separate. So managers were gaining more power.

Now, the question is about John Scott's argument. I don't remember exactly what he said, but I can infer based on the options. Let me look at the options provided.

Option A says managers were dissatisfied and planned to overthrow owners. That sounds more like a Marxist perspective, maybe, but I don't think that's what the managerial revolution is about. It's more about a shift in control rather than a revolution in the overthrow sense.

Option B: Owners still controlled through shareholders and interlocking directorships. So this is saying that even if managers are present, owners still have control mechanisms. I'm not sure if Scott agreed with this or opposed it. Maybe if someone else, like maybe the opposite view, says that owners are still in control, but Scott was arguing for the managerial revolution, so he might say that ownership and management are separating, which would mean owners aren't in control as much.

Option C: Ownership and management becoming separate. This aligns with what I was thinking earlier. The managerial revolution is about this separation, so Scott would argue that these functions are indeed separating.

Option D: The revolution was a myth, owners still held power. If Scott was supporting the managerial revolution, he'd disagree with this. Unless he was arguing against it, but the question says he argued, so I think he supported the revolution, meaning D is not correct.

Option E: Managers planning to unionize. Doesn't seem related. The question is about control structures, not labor movements.

Option F: Principles of scientific management are universal. Scientific management is more about Taylorism and efficiency methods, not directly about ownership vs. management control. So probably not relevant here.

Option G: Management becoming dependent on shareholders. If ownership and management are separate, maybe managers are less dependent on shareholders. Or perhaps more? I'm not sure. But I think Scott's point is about separation, not dependency.

Option H: Techniques of scientific management are inefficient. Again, not directly related to the managerial revolution's main argument about control.

Option I: Owners and managers merging into one role. That would be the opposite of the separation, so if Scott argues for separation, this is wrong.

Option J: Owners losing control due to management autonomy. This seems similar to the idea of the managerial revolution. So if Scott is arguing that managers are taking over, then J would make sense.

Wait, but the options C and J are similar. C says ownership and management are becoming separate functions, which is more about the structural separation. J is about owners losing control, which is a consequence of that separation.

So the question is, what exactly did Scott argue? I think the managerial revolution is about the shift in control from owners to managers, so both C and J could be correct. But looking at the options, perhaps C is the better fit because it directly describes the separation, which is the essence of the revolution. J is more about the result of that separation.

Alternatively, maybe Scott was pointing out that the separation is happening, so C would be the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The original theory by Berle and Means was that ownership and control were separating, leading to managers having more power. So if Scott in 1997 was arguing in line with that, he would say that ownership and management were becoming separate functions. So that would be option C.

But wait, another angle: some theorists might argue that while there's a separation, owners still maintain control through other means. For example, through shareholders or interlocking boards. So option B says owners still exercise control through groups of shareholders and interlocking directorships. If Scott was arguing against the idea that managers have taken over, he might say that owners still control. But the question says he argued in the debate about the managerial revolution, so I think he's supporting the revolution, meaning managers are gaining control, so the separation is real.

Therefore, the correct answer would be C: ownership and management were becoming increasingly separate functions.

The managerial revolution refers to the idea that ownership and control within businesses are becoming separated, with managers gaining more power at the expense of owners. John Scott's argument in 1997 aligns with this concept. Among the options provided:

- **Option A** suggests a Marxist-style overthrow, which is unrelated to the managerial revolution's focus on control shifts.
- **Option B** claims owners retain control through shareholders and interlocking directorships, which contradicts the idea of a managerial revolution.
- **Option C** states that ownership and management are becoming separate functions, directly reflecting the core idea of the managerial revolution.
- **Option D** argues the revolution is a myth, which contradicts Scott's support for the revolution.
- **Option E** discusses unionization, unrelated to the control structure debate.
- **Option F** and **Option H** focus on scientific management, which is not central to the managerial revolution.
- **Option G** suggests management dependence on shareholders, which does not align with the separation of ownership and control.
- **Option I** implies owners and managers merging, the opposite of the revolution's argument.
- **Option J** highlights owners losing control, a consequence of the separation, but not the primary structural change.

The most accurate representation of Scott's argument is **Option C**, as it directly describes the separation of ownership and management, the essence of the managerial revolution.

Answer: C
