Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to solve it. Let's read it carefully.

The problem says that a cycle and rider together weigh 186 lb. When moving at 10 mi/hr on a level road, the rider stops pedaling and comes to a stop after traveling 200 yards. The question is asking for the average frictional force resisting his motion. The options are given from A to J.

Hmm, right. So, let me break this down. I think I need to find the force of friction that's acting opposite to the motion, causing the bike to slow down and stop.

First, I remember that when an object is moving and then comes to a stop, it's decelerating, so there's acceleration involved. Since the rider stops pedaling, the only force acting (assuming no air resistance for simplicity, or maybe it's included in the frictional force) is friction, which provides the necessary force to decelerate the bike and rider.

Wait, but the problem mentions the weight as 186 lb. Oh, right, weight is mass times gravity. So, I might need to convert that weight into mass because the frictional force is mass times acceleration. Or wait, maybe I can work with the weight directly. Hmm.

I think the steps are: find the deceleration of the bike, then use Newton's second law (F=ma) to find the force, which in this case will be the frictional force.

But wait, the weight is given, which is F = mg. So mass would be weight divided by g. Let me note that down.

First, convert the speed from mi/hr to ft/s because the stopping distance is in yards, which I can convert to feet. Or maybe I should convert everything to consistent units. Yeah, let's choose the unit system.

The speed is 10 mi/hr. I know that 1 mile is 5280 feet, and 1 hour is 3600 seconds. So, 10 mi/hr is (10 * 5280 ft) / (3600 sec) = let me calculate:

10 * 5280 = 52,800 ft. 52,800 / 3600 is... let's see. 3600 goes into 52800 about 14.666... times. Because 14*3600=50,400, 15*3600=54,000. So 14.666... is 44/3. So 14.666 ft/s. Approximately 14.6667 ft/s.

Wait, let me double-check that math. 5280 *10 = 52,800. 52,800 / 3600 = (52800 ÷ 3600) = (528 ÷ 3.6) = let me compute 528 ÷ 3.6.

3.6 * 146 = 525.6. 528 - 525.6 = 2.4. 2.4 /3.6 = 0.666... So 146.666..., which is 146 and 2/3. So 146.6667 ft/s? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, 10 mi/hr is actually approximately 14.666 ft/s. Because 1 mi/hr is about 1.46667 ft/s. So 10 times that is 14.6667 ft/s. So that's the initial velocity.

Wait, no, wait a second. I think I messed up the calculation earlier. Let me redo it correctly.

10 mi/hr to ft/s: 10 * 5280 ft = 52,800 ft per hour. Divide by 3600 seconds to get ft/s: 52,800 / 3600.

Calculating 52,800 ÷ 3600: 3600 * 14 = 50,400. 52,800 -50,400 = 2,400. 2,400 / 3600 = 2/3 ≈ 0.6667. So total is 14.6667 ft/s. Yes, correct.

The bike comes to a stop, so final velocity is 0. The stopping distance is 200 yards. Wait, yards to feet: 200 yards * 3 ft/yard = 600 ft.

So initial velocity u = 14.6667 ft/s, final velocity v=0, distance s=600 ft. I need to find the acceleration (which will be negative, since it's deceleration) first.

I can use one of the kinematics equations. The one that relates initial velocity, final velocity, distance, and acceleration is:

v² = u² + 2 a s.

Since v is 0, the equation becomes 0 = u² + 2 a s. So solving for a: a = -u²/(2 s).

Plugging in the numbers: u = 14.6667 ft/s, s=600 ft.

So a = -(14.6667)^2 / (2 * 600).

Compute 14.6667 squared: 14^2 is 196; 0.6667 is 2/3, so (14 + 2/3)^2.

Alternatively, compute 14.6667 *14.6667.

14 *14=196. 14 *0.6667≈9.333. So 196 + 2*(14*0.6667) + (0.6667)^2.

Wait, maybe better to compute 14.6667^2:

14.6667 *14.6667.

I can compute this as (44/3) ft/s, since 14.6667 is 44/3. So (44/3)^2 = (44^2)/(3^2) = 1936/9.

So a = -(1936/9) / (2*600) = -(1936)/(9*1200) = -(1936)/(10800).

Simplify this fraction: 1936 ÷ 16 = 121; 10800 ÷16=675.

Wait, 1936 divided by 16 is 121? Wait, 16*121=1936 yes.

So 1936/10800 = (121)/(675) after dividing numerator and denominator by 16.

So a= -121/(675) ft/s².

Wait, let me compute 121 divided by 675. Let me see: 675 is 25*27, 121 is 11². So 121/675 ≈ 0.1793 ft/s². But since a is negative, it's approximately -0.1793 ft/s².

Wait, but wait, let me compute this more accurately.

Calculating 1936 / 10800:

1936 ÷ 10800.

Let me compute 10800 ÷ 1000 = 10.8.

1936 is about 1.936 *10^3.

So 1936 /10800 = (1.936 *10^3) / (10.8 *10^3) )= 1.936 / 10.8 ≈ 0.1793.

So a≈ -0.1793 ft/s².

Now, with the acceleration known, we can find the force using F=ma. But wait, mass is weight divided by g.

The weight is 186 lb. Wait, weight is a force, so weight = mass * g. So mass m=weight/g.

But here's a confusion point: units. In the English system, weight is in pounds (lb), which is a force. So to get mass in slugs, we divide by g (in ft/s²).

g is approximately 32 ft/s².

So m= 186 lb / 32 ft/s². But wait, mass is in slugs when using imperial units.

So, the frictional force F is m*a.

F = m*a = (186/32) * (-0.1793) lb.

Wait, let me compute this.

First, 186/32 = 5.8125 slugs.

Then, 5.8125 * (-0.1793) ≈ Let's calculate 5.8125 * 0.1793.

5 * 0.1793 = 0.8965.

0.8125 *0.1793 ≈ approximately 0.1457.

So total is 0.8965 + 0.1457 ≈ 1.0422.

So F ≈ -1.0422 lb.

Wait, but wait, the options don't have -1.0 lb, but option E is -1.0, and option J is -2.5, etc. So perhaps my approximation is a bit off. Let me do a more precise calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value without approximating early on.

Let me redo the acceleration calculation:

a = -u²/(2s) = -( (44/3)^2 ) / (2*600) )= -( (1936/9) ) / 1200 ) = -1936/(9*1200) )= -1936/(10800) )= -0.179333... ft/s².

So a is exactly -1936/10800 ft/s², which simplifies to -0.179333... ft/s².

Now, F = m * a. m is 186 lb / 32 ft/s², so m = 186/32 slugs.

So F = (186/32) * (-1936/10800).

Wait, let me compute this exactly.

First, 186 multiplied by 1936.

Wait, 186 * 1936. Hmm, that's a big number. Maybe there's a better way.

Wait, let's see if I can simplify the fractions before multiplying.

186/32 * (-1936)/10800.

Let me factor each number:

186 = 2 * 93 = 2*3*31.

32 = 2^5.

1936 = 44^2 = (4*11)^2 = 16 * 121 = 16 * 11^2.

10800 = 100 * 108 = 2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2.

So,

(186) / (32) ) * (1936)/(10800) )

= (2 *3 *31)/(2^5) ) * (16 * 11^2 )/(2^2 *3^3 *5^2) )

Combine terms:

Numerator: 2*3*31 *16*11^2.

Denominator: 2^5 * 2^2 *3^3 *5^2.

Simplify exponents:

Numerator factors:

2: 1 (from 2) +4 (from 16)=5.

3: 1.

31:1.

11:2.

Denominator factors:

2:5+2=7.

3:3.

5:2.

So,

= (2^5 *3^1 *31^1 *11^2 ) / (2^7 *3^3 *5^2) )

Simplify by subtracting exponents:

2^(5-7)=2^-2=1/4.

3^(1-3)=3^-2=1/9.

So,

= (31 *11^2) / (4 *9 *5^2 )

Compute numerator: 31 * 121 = 31*120=3720 +31=3751.

Denominator:4 *9=36; 36 *25=900.

So, 3751 / 900 = approximately 4.1667.

Wait, but wait, we have a negative sign from acceleration, so F= -3751/(900) lb.

Wait, wait, wait, I think I messed up, because the initial expression was: (186/32) * (-1936/10800) )= - (186 *1936)/(32 *10800).

So, the product is negative, so F is negative.

So, 186 *1936 = let's compute 186*1936.

Hmm, 186 * 2000= 372,000. But 1936 is 64 less than 2000, so 186*(2000-64) = 372000 - 186*64.

186*64: 180*64=11520, 6*64=384 → 11520+384=11904.

So 372000 - 11904 = 360,096.

So, 186 *1936 = 360,096.

Denominator: 32 *10800 = 345,600.

So, F = -(360,096) / (345,600 ) lb.

Simplify this fraction:

Divide numerator and denominator by 1008: Let me see. Let me compute GCD.

Alternatively, divide numerator and denominator by 48: 360096 ÷48 = 7502 (48*7502= 48*(7500)=360000 → 48*2=96; 360000+96=360096). Denominator 345600 ÷48=7200.

So, now it's -7502 /7200.

Wait, 7502 and 7200: let's see if they have a common divisor.

7502 ÷2=3751, 7200 ÷2=3600.

So now, -3751/3600.

3751 divided by 3600 is approximately 1.0414. So F≈ -1.0414 lb.

Looking at the options, option E is -1.0 lb, option A is -1.8 lb. So my calculation is approximately -1.04 lb. So the closest option is E: -1.0 lb.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. Because if I miscalculated, perhaps the correct answer is different.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute using decimals precisely.

Compute F= (186/32) * (-0.1793) lb.

186 divided by 32: 32*5=160, 186-160=26, 26/32=0.8125 → 5.8125.

So 5.8125 * (-0.1793) = ?

Let me compute 5 * 0.1793 = 0.8965.

0.8125 *0.1793: 0.8 *0.1793=0.14344; 0.0125 *0.1793≈0.002241. So total ≈0.14344 +0.002241=0.145681.

So total is 0.8965 +0.145681=1.042181.

So F≈-1.0422 lb.

So approximately -1.04 lb. The options don't have exactly that, but the closest is E: -1.0 lb. Wait, but wait, let's see the options again.

Options are:

A: -1.8 lb

B: -0.5 lb

C:2.5 lb

D:3.2 lb

E: -1.0 lb

F: -0.18 lb

G:5.8 lb

H: -3.2 lb

I:0.5 lb

J: -2.5 lb.

So the closest is E. But wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the calculation.

Wait, let me compute 5.8125 * 0.1793 exactly.

Let me write them as decimals.

5.8125 * 0.1793.

Multiply 5.8125 by 0.1793:

First, 5.8125 * 0.1 = 0.58125

5.8125 *0.07 = 0.406875

5.8125 *0.009=0.0523125

5.8125 *0.0003=0.00174375

Adding them up:

0.58125 + 0.406875 = 0.988125

+0.0523125 → 1.0404375

+0.00174375 → 1.04218125.

So exact product is 1.04218125. So F is approximately -1.0422 lb.

So the closest option is E: -1.0 lb.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units somewhere. Let me double-check all steps.

Wait, another approach: Using work-energy theorem. The work done by friction is equal to the change in kinetic energy.

Work done W = Friction force * distance = F * d.

Kinetic energy change is (1/2)mv². Since the final velocity is 0, it's (1/2)mv² -0 = (1/2)mv².

So,

F * d = (1/2) m v².

Wait, but m is mass. Hmm, but I have weight, which is mg. So m = W/g.

So,

F = ( (1/2) m v² ) / d.

Plugging in m= W/g, F becomes:

F = ( (1/2) (W/g) v² ) / d.

F = (W v²) / (2 g d).

Wait, let me try that.

Given:

W =186 lb.

v=14.6667 ft/s.

d=600 ft.

g=32 ft/s².

So,

F = (186 * (14.6667)^2 ) / (2 *32 *600).

Compute numerator: 186 * (14.6667)^2.

We know 14.6667 is 44/3. So (44/3)^2 = 1936/9.

So 186 * (1936/9) = (186 *1936)/9.

186 divided by 9 is 20.6667. So 20.6667 *1936.

Hmm, 20*1936=38,720.

0.6667 *1936≈ approx 1290. So total numerator is approximately 38,720 + 1,290 =40,010.

Denominator: 2 *32 *600= 38400.

So F≈40,010 / 38,400 ≈1.0411 lb.

So again, F≈1.041 lb, but since friction is opposing motion, F≈-1.041 lb.

Which again, the closest option is E: -1.0 lb.

Wait, but another thought: Maybe I should have kept more precise numbers earlier. Let me compute 186*1936/9.

Wait, 186 = 2 *93 = 2 *3*31.

1936=16*121.

So,

(186 *1936) = (2*3*31) * (16 * 121) )= 2*16 *3 *31 *121.

Which is 32 *3 *31*121.

Compute 32 *3=96.

96 *31= 96*30=2880 +96=2976.

2976 *121: Let's compute 2976 *120= 357,120 and 2976 *1=2,976 → total 360,096.

So numerator is 360,096 /9 = 40,012.
