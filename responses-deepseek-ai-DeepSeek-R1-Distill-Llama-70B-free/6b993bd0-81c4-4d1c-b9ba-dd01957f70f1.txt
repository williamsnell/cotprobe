Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the composition of an alcohol-water mixture that won't freeze above -10°C. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my chemistry, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question mentions something about the freezing point. Oh right, this must be related to freezing point depression. I remember that when you mix a solvent with a solute, the freezing point of the solvent decreases. The formula for that is delta T equals Kf times the molality, right? So delta T is the change in freezing point.

Wait, the problem says the mixture shouldn't freeze above -10°C. So the freezing point should be at or below -10°C. I think that means the freezing point depression is the difference between the normal freezing point of water and the new temperature. Water normally freezes at 0°C, right?

So delta T would be 0°C minus (-10°C) which is 10°C. Because the freezing point is depressed by 10 degrees.

The Kf for water is given as 1.86°C·kg/mol. So plugging into the formula: delta T = Kf * m. So m is molality, which is moles of solute per kg of solvent.

Wait wait, but wait. Let me get this straight. The formula is ΔTf = Kf * m. So m is the molality of the solution. So to find m, I divide ΔTf by Kf.

So m = ΔTf / Kf. ΔTf here is 10°C. So 10 divided by 1.86. Let me calculate that. 10 / 1.86 is approximately... let's see, 1.86 times 5 is 9.3. 10 -9.3 is 0.7, so 0.7/1.86 is about 0.376. So 5.376, roughly 5.38 molal. Hmm, but wait, looking at the options, I don't see exactly 5.38. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options given are: A:5.4, B:2.8, C:8.0, D:4.5, E:6.3, F:4.0, G:3.2, H:7.2, I:7.8, J:9.6. Oh, option A is 5.4, which is close to my calculation of 5.38. So that would make sense.

Wait, but wait. Oh wait, the solvent here is water, and the solute is alcohol. So when calculating molality, it's moles of alcohol per kg of water. So does that affect anything? I don't think so because the formula uses the solvent's Kf, which is given for water. So my approach should still be correct.

Wait another thing: is the formula correct? So delta T is the change in freezing point. Since the mixture is freezing at -10°C, the change is 10°C. So yes, that part is correct.

Wait, actually, no. Wait. Let me think again. The freezing point of pure water is 0°C. The mixture's freezing point is -10°C, so the change is -10 - 0 = -10°C. But delta T is a positive value in the formula, representing the magnitude of the depression. So delta T is 10°C, so the calculation still holds.

So m = 10 / 1.86. Let me compute that accurately. 1.86 times 5 is 9.3, as before. So 10 - 9.3 is 0.7. 0.7 divided by 1.86. Let's compute 0.7 / 1.86. 1.86 times 0.375 is 0.6975. So approximately 0.376. So 5.376 molal, which is approximately 5.4, so option A.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here. Another way to check: if the molality is 5.4, then delta T would be 1.86 *5.4. Let me compute that. 1.8 *5 is 9, 0.06 *5 is 0.3, so 9.3. 1.8 *0.4 is 0.72, 0.06 *0.4 is 0.024. So 1.86 *5.4: 5 times is 9.3, 0.4 times is 0.744. 9.3 +0.744 is 10.044. So delta T would be about 10.04, which is a bit over 10. But our calculation required a delta T of 10. Hmm, but that's okay because the question says the mixture shouldn't freeze above -10, which means it should freeze at or below that. So a delta T of 10.04 would make the freezing point -10.04°C, which is below -10. So that's acceptable.

Wait, but wait, another thought. The formula is delta T = Kf * m. So if the required freezing point is -10°C, then delta T is 10 (since it's the amount the freezing point has decreased from 0). So any m that gives a delta T of at least 10 will result in a freezing point <=-10. So the minimum m needed is 10 /1.86 = approx 5.376. So the molality must be at least that. So if the question is asking for a composition that will not freeze above -10, that means it can handle at least a 10°C depression. So the molality has to be at least around 5.38. So the closest option is A:5.4.

So I think the correct answer is A.

To calculate the composition (molality) of an alcohol-water mixture that will not freeze above -10°C, we use the freezing point depression formula:

\[
\Delta T_f = K_f \cdot m
\]

Here:
- \(\Delta T_f\) is the freezing point depression, which is the difference between the freezing point of pure water (0°C) and the desired freezing point of the mixture (-10°C). Thus, \(\Delta T_f = 0 - (-10) = 10^\circ \text{C}\).
- \(K_f\) is the freezing point constant for water, given as \(1.86^\circ \text{C·kg/mol}\).
- \(m\) is the molality of the solution, which represents the moles of solute (alcohol) per kilogram of solvent (water).

Rearranging the formula to solve for \(m\):

\[
m = \frac{\Delta T_f}{K_f}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
m = \frac{10}{1.86} \approx 5.376 \, \text{molal}
\]

This means the molality of the alcohol-water mixture must be at least approximately \(5.38 \, \text{molal}\) to ensure the freezing point is at or below \(-10^\circ \text{C}\). Among the given options, the closest value is \(5.4 \, \text{molal}\), which corresponds to option A.

To verify, if \(m = 5.4 \, \text{molal}\), the freezing point depression would be:

\[
\Delta T_f = K_f \cdot m = 1.86 \cdot 5.4 \approx 10.04^\circ \text{C}
\]

This results in a freezing point of approximately \(-10.04^\circ \text{C}\), which satisfies the condition of not freezing above \(-10^\circ \text{C}\).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**A: 5.4 molal**
