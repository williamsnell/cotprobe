Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about chemical kinetics, specifically dealing with the activation energy and the effect of temperature on reaction rates. Hmm, I need to tackle both parts of the question and match my answers to the options given. Let's take it step by step.

Starting with part (1): A reaction proceeds five times as fast at 60°C as it does at 30°C. I need to estimate the energy of activation. I remember that the Arrhenius equation relates the rate constant k to temperature and activation energy. The equation is k = A * exp(-Ea/(R T)). But when comparing two rates at two temperatures, the ratio of the rates (or rate constants) can be used.

So the ratio k2/k1 = (T2/T1) * exp( (Ea/R) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )^(-1) ) Wait, no, let me get this right. Wait, the Arrhenius equation for two temperatures is (k2/k1) = exp( [Ea/R] (1/T1 - 1/T2) ). Wait, no, the correct formula is the Arrhenius equation in the two-point form. Oh right, the correct form is ln(k2/k1) = (Ea/R) [ (1/T1) - (1/T2) ] / (1). So ln(5) = Ea/(R) [ (1/303) - (1/333) ] — wait, because 30°C is 303 K (30+273) and 60°C is 333 K.

Wait, let me calculate the temperatures first. 30°C is 303 K, 60 is 333 K. So 1/303 is approximately 0.003300, and 1/333 is about 0.003003. The difference is 0.000297. So (1/303 - 1/333) = (333 -303)/(303*333) )= 30/(303*333) → let's compute that. 303 * 333 is approximately 303*300 =90,900 and 303*33=10,000 roughly, so about 101,000. So 30 / 101,000 ≈ 0.000297. So the difference is approximately 0.000297.

So ln(5) is about 1.609. So 1.609 = Ea/(R) * 0.000297. Wait, R is the gas constant. In which units? Because activation energy is usually in cal/mol or kJ/mol. R is 1.987 cal/(mol·K) or 8.314 J/(mol·K). Since the options are in kcal, I'll use R as 1.987 cal/(mol·K).

So rearranging the equation: Ea = [ ln(5) * R ] / ( (1/303) - (1/333) )? Wait, no. The equation is ln(k2/k1) = (Ea/R)(1/T1 - 1/T2). So Ea = ln(5) * R / ( (1/T1) - (1/T2) ). Wait, wait, no, let me get the denominator right. Because 1/T1 - 1/T2 is the same as (T2 - T1)/(T1 T2). So let me compute that.

Wait, 1/303 is approx 0.0033, and 1/333 is 0.003003. So 1/303 - 1/333 = 0.000297. So the denominator is 0.000297 K^-1.

So Ea = [ ln(5) * R ] / 0.000297.

Plugging in the numbers: ln(5) is about 1.6094. R is 1.987 cal/(mol·K). So 1.6094 * 1.987 ≈ let's see: 1.6 * 2 is 3.2, so 1.6094 *1.987 is approximately 3.2 (exact calculation: 1.6094 * 1.987 → 1.6 *1.987 = 3.1792, 0.0094 *1.987≈0.0187 → total ~3.1979).

So Ea ≈ 3.198 / 0.000297 → Let's compute that. 3.198 / 0.000297. Hmm, 0.0003 is 3e-4. 3.198 / 3e-4 = 10,660. But wait, 0.000297 is a little less than 0.0003, so the result would be a bit higher. Let me compute it more accurately.

3.198 / 0.000297 = ?

Let me write 0.000297 as 2.97e-4. So 3.198 / 2.97e-4 → 3.198 / 0.000297. Let me compute 3.198 / 0.0003 = 10,660. But since 0.000297 is 0.3 * 0.99, so 3.198/(0.3 *0.99) )= (3.198/0.3 ) / 0.99 → 10.66 / 0.99 ≈ 10.77. Wait, that doesn't make sense because 0.000297 is 0.3 *0.99? Wait, no, 0.0003 is 3e-4, and 0.000297 is 3e-4 * 0.99 → because 0.3 *0.99=0.297. So 3.198 / (3e-4 * 0.99) )= (3.198/(3e-4)) ) * (1/0.99) → (3.198 / 0.0003 ) * (1/0.99). So 3.198 /0.0003 is 10,660, and 10,660 * (1/0.99)= approx 10,770.

So Ea is approximately 10,770 cal/mol. Which is 10.77 kcal/mol. Looking at the options for part (1), let's see:

Option B: 10.8 kcal/mol. Option E:11.2, Option A:12, etc. So the closest is B:10.8, which is probably the answer for part (1).

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculation. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, the formula is ln(k2/k1) = (Ea/R)[(1/T1) - (1/T2)]. So yes, Ea = [ ln(5) * R ] / [ (1/303 - 1/333) ]

Wait no, (1/T1 - 1/T2) is positive because T2 > T1. So that's correct.

Wait, but in the denominator, (1/303 - 1/333) is positive, because 1/303 >1/333. So yes.

Wait, R is 1.987 cal/mol K, correct? Yes. So the calculation seems right.

So part (1) answer is approximately 10.8 kcal/mol. So looking at the options, part (1) is 10.8 in option B and E is 11.2, etc.

So moving on to part (2): For a gas-phase reaction with Ea = 40,000 cal/mol, estimate the change in rate constant due to a temperature change from 1000°C to 2000°C.

Wait, wait, 1000°C is 1273 K (1000+273=1273), and 2000°C is 2273 K. So T1=1273, T2=2273.

We need to find the ratio k2/k1. Again, using the Arrhenius equation.

ln(k2/k1) = (Ea/R) [ (1/T1) - (1/T2) ]

Ea is given as 40,000 cal/mol. R is 1.987 cal/mol K.

Plugging in the numbers:

Compute (1/T1 -1/T2) → (1/1273 - 1/2273) → Let's calculate this.

1/1273 ≈ 0.0007855, 1/2273 ≈ 0.0004400. So the difference is approximately 0.0003455.

So (Ea/R) * (0.0003455) → (40000 / 1.987) * 0.0003455.

Compute 40000 /1.987 → approx 20,150 (because 1.987 *20,000=39,740 → 40000-39740=260 → 260/1.987≈130.8 → so 20,130.8 ≈ 20,131).

So 20,131 * 0.0003455 → Let's compute:

20,131 * 0.0003 = 6.0393

20,131 * 0.0000455 = let's see: 20,131 *0.00004=8.0524, 20,131 *0.0000055= approx 110.7205 → 8.0524 +0.1107=8.1631. So total is 6.0393 +8.1631=14.2024.

So ln(k2/k1)=14.2024 → so k2/k1 = e^14.2024.

What's e^14.2? Let's recall that e^10≈22026, e^14= e^10 * e^4 → 22026 *54.598≈ 1,200,000? Let me compute more accurately.

e^14 is approximately 1.202e6 (since e^14 ≈ 1,202,604). So e^14.2024 is higher than e^14.

Let me compute the exact value: 14.2024.

Compute e^14.2024 = e^14 * e^0.2024.

e^0.2 is about 1.2214, e^0.2024≈1.2237.

So 1.202e6 * 1.2237 ≈ 1.202e6 *1.22 → 1.202 *1.22=1.46644 → 1.46644e6, so approximately 1,466,440 times.

Wait, but looking at the options, the second part's options are in the hundreds or thousands. For example, option B says 1050 times, option F says 3000, option E is 1500, option I is 1250, option J is 2500.

Wait, wait, 1.4 million is way larger than any of these options. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me double-check the given Ea. Oh wait, the question states Ea is 40,000 cal/mol, which is 40,000 cal/mol. Oh wait, but perhaps the given options are in kilocalories, so 40,000 cal/mol is 40 kcal/mol. Wait no, 40,000 cal is 40 k cal. So that's correct.

Wait, but wait, perhaps the calculation is wrong. Let me recalculate the (1/T1 -1/T2) term.

T1=1273 K, T2=2273 K.

Compute 1/1273 = approx 0.0007855.

1/2273 = approx 0.0004400.

Difference is 0.0003455.

So (Ea/R) * (0.0003455) = (40000 cal/mol) / (1.987 cal/mol K) ) * 0.0003455 K^-1.

40000 /1.987 = approx 20,150 cal/(mol·K) * K^-1 → unit is cal/mol.

Wait, 20,150 * 0.0003455 → 20,150 * 0.0003 is 6.045, 20,150 *0.0000455= approx 0.916. So total is 6.045 +0.916=6.961.

So ln(k2/k1)=6.961 → then k2/k1 = e^6.961.

e^6 is about 403.4, e^7 is about 1096.6. So 6.961 is between 6 and7. Let's compute e^6.961.

Compute 6.961 -6=0.961. So e^0.961 → e^0.9 is 2.4596, e^0.961≈2.618.

So e^6.961= e^6 * e^0.961 ≈403.4 *2.618 ≈1055. So approximately 1055 times.

Looking at the options, part (2) is 1050 times, which is option B. So option B for part (2) would be 1050 times.

Wait, but the options list part (1) and (2) together. So looking at the options:

Option B: 10.8 kcal/mol (part1), 1050 times (part2).

So the correct answer must have part1 as 10.8 and part2 as 1050, which is option B.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the second calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, in part (2), I computed (1/1273 -1/2273) = 0.0003455.

Ea is 40,000 cal/mol, R is 1.987.

Ea/R=40000/1.987≈20,150.

Multiply by 0.0003455 → 20,150 *0.0003455=?

Let me compute 20,150 * 0.0003 =6.045.

20,150 *0.0000455= let's compute 20,150 *0.00004=8.06, 20,150 *0.0000055=0.1108. So total 8.06+0.1108=8.1708.

So 6.045+8.1708=14.2158.

Wait, wait, earlier I thought I got 6.96, but now I'm getting 14.2158. Oh no, I think I messed up the calculation earlier.

Wait, hold on. No, wait, (1/1273 -1/2273) is 0.0003455. So Ea/R is 20,150. Multiply 20,150 by 0.0003455 → 20,150 * 0.0003455.

Let me compute 20,150 * 0.0003 =6.045.

20,150 *0.0000455=?

Wait, 20,150 * 0.00004=8.06.

20,150 *0.0000055=0.110825.

Adding 8.06 + 0.110825 =8.170825.

So total is 6.045 +8.170825=14.2158.

So ln(k2/k1)=14.2158 → so k2/k1= e^14.2158.

Wait, what is e^14.2158? Let me compute.

We know that e^14 is about 1.202e6 (1,202,604). e^0.2158 is approx 1.2405 (since ln(1.24)=0.215).

So e^14.2158= e^14 * e^0.2158 ≈1,202,604 *1.2405 ≈1,489,000.

Wait that's around 1.489e6 times. But none of the options for part (2) are that high. The options for part (2) are in the hundreds or low thousands.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps the formula I used is wrong. Wait, the Arrhenius equation for the ratio is ln(k2/k1) = (Ea/R)(1/T1 - 1/T2). So with Ea in cal/mol, R in cal/mol K, and T in K.

Wait, but in part (2), the given Ea is 40,000 cal/mol. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is that the temperatures are in Kelvin, which they are. So T1=1273 K, T2=2273 K. So 1/1273 ≈0.000785, 1/2273≈0.000440. So 0.000785 -0.000440=0.000345.

So (Ea/R) * (1/T1 -1/T2) = (40000/1.987) * 0.000345.

Wait, 40000/1.987 = approx 20,150.

20,150 * 0.000345 = 20,150 * 3.45e-4.

Let me compute 20,150 *3.45e-4.

20,150 * 0.0003=6.045.

20,150 *0.000045= approx 0.90675. So 6.045 +0.90675=6.95175.

So ln(k2/k1)=6.95175 → so k2/k1= e^6.95175.

What's e^6.95? e^7≈1096, but 6.95 is 0.05 less than 7. e^(-0.05)=0.9512, so e^6.95= e^7 * e^(-0.05)=1096 *0.9512≈1042. So about 1042 times.

Looking at the options, the closest is option B, where part (2) is 1050 times. So that's a match.

So, putting it together: part (1) is 10.8 kcal/mol, part (2) is 1050 times. Which corresponds to option B.

To solve the given problem, we analyze the two parts using the Arrhenius equation and related formulas.

---

### Part (1): Estimate the energy of activation
The reaction proceeds five times as fast at 60°C as it does at 30°C. Using the Arrhenius equation in its two-point form:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{k_2}{k_1}\right) = \frac{E_a}{R} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)
\]

Where:
- \( T_1 = 30^\circ\text{C} = 303 \, \text{K} \)
- \( T_2 = 60^\circ\text{C} = 333 \, \text{K} \)
- \( \frac{k_2}{
