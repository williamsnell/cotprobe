Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electromagnetic waves and power absorption. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I remember that when a wave hits a surface, some of it might get reflected and some absorbed. But wait, in this case, the wave is hitting a copper sheet, which is a conductor. So I think that copper is a good conductor, meaning it's a good reflector but maybe absorbs a little.

The question is about the average power absorbed per square meter. The wave is a plane wave traveling at 1,000 Mc/sec. Oh wait, Mc/sec is megacycles per second, so that's 1e6 cycles per second. So the frequency f is 1e6 Hz. 

The peak electric field is 1 volt/meter. I remember that the average power of an electromagnetic wave is related to the Poynting vector. The Poynting vector's average value gives the power per unit area. The formula for average Poynting vector is (E^2)/(2*η), where η is the intrinsic impedance of the medium. Since the wave is in air, η for air is the same as the impedance of free space, which I think is about 377 ohms.

Wait, but wait. When the wave hits a conductor, like copper, which is a good conductor, I think it reflects most of the wave. But a small part is absorbed. Oh right, the absorption is related to the skin depth. But maybe there's a simpler approach here.

The peak electric field is 1 V/m, so the rms (root mean square) value would be E_rms = E_peak / sqrt(2). Because for a sinusoidal wave, the rms is peak divided by square root of 2. So E_rms is 1 / sqrt(2) ≈ 0.707 V/m.

The average power density (P_avg) is E_rms squared divided by (2 * η). So that's ( (1)^2 / 2 ) / (2 * 377 )? Wait, no. Wait, the formula is P_avg = (E_rms * H_rms), and since H_rms is E_rms / η, then P_avg = E_rms^2 / η. Alternatively, I might have the formula a bit mixed up.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the average power (intensity) of an electromagnetic wave is S_avg = (E_0^2) / (2 * η). Because E_0 is the peak electric field. So using E_0 = 1 V/m, η = 377 ohms.

So S_avg = (1^2) / (2 * 377) = 1/(754) ≈ 0.001326 W/m².

But wait, that's the intensity of the incident wave. Now, when the wave hits the copper sheet, some is reflected and some is absorbed. Copper is a good conductor, so I think it's a high reflection scenario. But what's the absorption?

I remember that for a perfect conductor, the reflection coefficient is 1, meaning all the wave is reflected, and nothing is absorbed. But real conductors like copper have some finite conductivity, so a small amount is absorbed.

The absorption can be found using the concept of the skin depth. The skin depth δ is given by δ = sqrt( (2 * η) / (ω * σ * μ) ) ), or something like that. But wait, maybe there's a simpler approach for finding the absorbed power.

Alternatively, I think the power absorbed can be calculated using the concept of the real part of the impedance. But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the reflection coefficient Γ for a wave going from air (η0 = 377) to a conductor (η = η0 + (σ/ω ε0) )? Or wait, for a good conductor, the intrinsic impedance η is approximately η = (1 + j)/sqrt(ω μ σ) ), but maybe that's more than I need.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the reflection coefficient and the transmission. The power transmitted into the conductor would then be the fraction that's not reflected. The power absorbed would be the transmitted power times the fraction absorbed inside the conductor.

The reflection coefficient Γ is (η2 - η1)/(η2 + η1). But for a perfect conductor, η2 is zero. So Γ would be (0 - η0)/(0 + η0) = -1. So all is reflected, none transmitted. But since copper isn't perfect, some is transmitted and absorbed.

Wait, but copper is a very good conductor, so σ is very large. So the intrinsic impedance η_copper would be much smaller than η0. Let me think: for a good conductor, η ≈ sqrt( (j ω μ)/(σ + j ω ε) ) ). But since σ >> ω ε, this reduces to η ≈ sqrt( (j ω μ)/σ ). Which is a small value because σ is large.

So the reflection coefficient Γ = (η_copper - η0)/(η_copper + η0). Since η_copper is small, this becomes approximately (-η0)/(η0) = -1. So again, almost all is reflected. So the transmitted power is very small.

The transmitted power is proportional to 1 - |Γ|^2. So if Γ is very close to -1, then |Γ| is nearly 1, so 1 - |Γ|^2 is very small. So the power transmitted is small, which is the power absorbed.

Wait, but perhaps there's a standard formula for the power absorbed by a conductor when an EM wave is incident on it. Let me think. I recall that the average power per unit area (P_avg) absorbed by a conductor is given by (E_0^2 * η) / (4 * η0), where η is the intrinsic impedance of the conductor. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, for a conductor, the absorption can be approximated by the real part of the impedance. But I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should think in terms of the skin depth and the power dissipated.

The skin depth δ is the depth to which the wave penetrates before the amplitude drops by 1/e. It's given by δ = 1/α, where α is the attenuation constant.

For a conductor, the intrinsic impedance η is approximately η = (1 + j)/sqrt(ω μ σ)}. But the real part of η is important for power dissipation. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the power absorbed per unit area can be calculated as the product of the intensity of the incident wave and the absorption coefficient. The intensity is S_avg = (E_0^2)/(2 η0) as I calculated before, which is approximately 1/(2*377) ≈ 0.001326 W/m².

The absorption coefficient A is 1 - |Γ|^2, which is the fraction of power that's not reflected. So if Γ is -1, A is zero. But for a real conductor, Γ is close to -1 but not exactly. So A would be a small number.

Wait, perhaps I can find σ for copper. The conductivity of copper is about 5.96 × 10^7 S/m (siemens per meter). Let me plug that into some formula.

The intrinsic impedance of a conductor is η = η0 * sqrt( (j ω ε0) / (σ + j ω ε0) ) )

But for good conductors, σ >> ω ε0, so this simplifies to η ≈ η0 * sqrt( (j ω ε0) / σ )

Which is η ≈ η0 * sqrt( (j ω ε0) ) / sqrt(σ) )

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated. Alternatively, the intrinsic impedance simplifies to η ≈ (1 + j) * η0 * sqrt( (ω ε0) / (2 σ) ) )

Wait, I think the correct approximation for η when σ is much larger than ω ε is:

η ≈ (1 + j) * sqrt( (ω μ) / (2 σ) )

Since μ for copper is approximately μ0 = 4π × 1e-7 H/m.

So let's compute this. Let me get the values:

f = 1e6 Hz → ω = 2πf ≈ 6.283e6 rad/s.

μ = 4πe-7 H/m.

σ = 5.96e7 S/m.

So η ≈ (1 + j) * sqrt( (6.283e6 * 4πe-7) / (2 * 5.96e7) ) )

Let me compute the numerator inside the square root:

6.283e6 * 4πe-7 = 6.283e6 * 4 * 3.1416e-7 ≈ 6.283e6 * 1.2566e-6 ≈ approx 7.90.

Then 7.90 / (2 *5.96e7) → 7.90 / (1.192e8) ≈ 6.62e-8.

So sqrt(6.62e-8) ≈ 8.135e-4.

So η ≈ (1 + j) * 8.135e-4 ohms.

So the magnitude of η is about 8.135e-4 ohms.

Now, the reflection coefficient Γ is (η_copper - η0)/(η_copper + η0).

η0 is 377 ohms, and η_copper is approximately 8.135e-4 ohms. So:

Γ ≈ (8.135e-4 - 377)/(8.135e-4 + 377) = (-376.992...) / (377.0008...) ≈ -0.999.

So |Γ| is about 0.999, so the power reflection coefficient is |Γ|^2 ≈ 0.998. So the absorption coefficient A is 1 - 0.998 = 0.002, or 0.2%.

So the absorbed power is the incident power multiplied by A.

The incident power is S_avg = (1^2)/(2 * 377) ≈ 0.001326 W/m².

Multiply this by A=0.002: 0.001326 * 0.002 ≈ 2.652e-6 W/m².

Wait, but looking at the options, option I is 1.16e-6, option F is 1.16e-8, etc. My calculation gives around 2.65e-6, which isn't exactly matching any of the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me recheck.

Wait, the intrinsic impedance of the conductor. Let me recompute η. Let me be precise.

η ≈ sqrt( (ω μ)/(2 σ) ) * (1 + j). Wait, no, that's not quite right. The formula for the intrinsic impedance of a conductor is η = sqrt( (j ω μ)/(σ + j ω ε) ) )

But for σ >> ω ε, this simplifies to η ≈ sqrt( (j ω μ)/σ ). Let me compute that.

So η = sqrt( (j ω μ) / σ )

= sqrt( j * (ω μ) / σ )

= sqrt( j ) * sqrt( (ω μ) / σ )

Since sqrt(j) is (1 + j)/sqrt(2), this becomes:

η = (1 + j)/sqrt(2) ) * sqrt( (ω μ)/(σ) )

So the magnitude of η is sqrt( (ω μ)/(σ) ) / sqrt(2) = sqrt( (ω μ)/(2 σ) )

Let me compute that:

ω = 2π * 1e6 ≈ 6.283e6 rad/s.

μ = 4πe-7 H/m.

σ = 5.96e7 S/m.

So,

(ω μ) = 6.283e6 * 4πe-7 ≈ 6.283e6 * 1.2566e-6 ≈ 7.90.

Divide by (2 * σ): 7.90 / (2 * 5.96e7) ≈ 7.90 / 1.192e8 ≈ 6.62e-8.

So sqrt(6.62e-8) ≈ 8.135e-4.

So the magnitude of η is 8.135e-4 ohms.

So η is approximately 8.135e-4 ohms.

Now, the reflection coefficient Γ when moving from medium 1 (η0=377) to medium 2 (η=8.135e-4) is:

Γ = (η2 - η0)/(η2 + η0) = (8.135e-4 - 377)/(8.135e-4 + 377) 

≈ ( -376.992 ) / ( 377.0008 ) ≈ -0.999 approximately.

So |Γ| is about 0.999, as before.

So the absorption A is 1 - (0.999)^2 = 1 - 0.998001 = 0.001999, or approximately 0.2%.

So the average power absorbed is S_avg * A.

S_avg is (E_peak)^2/(2 η0) = (1)^2/(2 * 377) = 1/(754) ≈ 0.001326 W/m².

Multiply by A≈0.002: 0.001326 * 0.002 ≈ 2.652e-6 W/m².

Looking at the options, option I is 1.16e-6. Hmm. But my calculation is about 2.65e-6. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should calculate the real part of the Poynting vector in the conductor. The average power per unit area into the conductor is Re(S) = |E|^2 * Re(1/η*), where η* is the complex conjugate of η.

Wait, but perhaps that approach is more accurate. Let me try it.

In the conductor, the electric field is E = E0 e^{-α z} e^{-j β z}, where α is the attenuation constant.

The average power dissipated per unit volume is given by P_vol = (1/2) σ |E|^2.

So the power per unit area (since it's per square meter) is integral from 0 to infinity of P_vol dz.

Which would be (1/2) σ E0^2 ∫ e^{-2 α z} dz from 0 to ∞.

The integral is 1/(2 α).

So P_avg = (1/2) σ E0^2 * (1/(2 α)) ) = (σ E0^2) / (4 α )

Now, we can express this in terms of η.

We know that η = sqrt( (j ω μ)/(σ + j ω ε) ) )

But for good conductors, σ >> ω ε, so η ≈ sqrt( (j ω μ)/σ ) = sqrt( (ω μ)/(σ) ) * (1 + j)/sqrt(2)

The magnitude of η is sqrt( (ω μ)/(σ) ) * 1/sqrt(2) ) = sqrt( (ω μ) / (2 σ) )

So, η_mag = sqrt( (ω μ)/(2 σ) )

The attenuation constant α is given by α = ω sqrt(μ ε) / (2 c) ) * something... Wait, for conductors, the attenuation constant is given by α = (1/δ), where δ is the skin depth.

Wait, skin depth δ = sqrt( (2)/(ω μ σ) )

So δ = sqrt( 2/(ω μ σ) )

So α = 1/δ = sqrt( ω μ σ / 2 )

Thus, α = sqrt( (ω μ σ)/2 )

So, substituting back into P_avg:

P_avg = (σ E0^2) / (4 * sqrt( (ω μ σ)/2 ) )

Simplify this expression.

Let me compute it step by step.

P_avg = σ E0^2 / (4 * [ (ω μ σ / 2 )^(1/2) ] )

= σ E0^2 / (4 * [ sqrt(ω μ σ / 2) ] )

= σ E0^2 / (4 * sqrt( (ω μ σ) / 2 ) )

Factor out sqrt(σ):

= σ E0^2 / [4 * sqrt( (ω μ σ)/2 ) ]

= σ E0^2 / [4 * sqrt( (ω μ σ) ) / sqrt(2) ) ]

= σ E0^2 * sqrt(2) / [4 * sqrt( ω μ σ ) ]

= (σ E0^2 * sqrt(2)) / (4 sqrt{ω μ σ} )

Simplify sqrt(σ) in numerator and denominator:

= ( sqrt(σ) * E0^2 * sqrt(2) ) / (4 sqrt( ω μ ) )

= ( E0^2 * sqrt(2 σ) ) / (4 sqrt( ω μ ) )

Hmm, perhaps a better approach. Let me express everything in terms of η.

We know that η_mag = sqrt( (ω μ)/(2 σ) )

So sqrt(σ) = sqrt( (ω μ) ) / (sqrt(2) η_mag )

Wait, let me solve for sqrt(σ):

η_mag = sqrt( (ω μ) / (2 σ) )

=> η_mag^2 = (ω μ) / (2 σ )

=> 2 σ η_mag^2 = ω μ

=> σ = (ω μ) / (2 η_mag^2 )

But not sure if this helps.

Wait, let's try substituting η_mag into P_avg.

From earlier, P_avg = (σ E0^2) / (4 α )

And α = sqrt( (ω μ σ ) / 2 )

So,

P_avg = (σ E0^2 ) / (4 * sqrt( (ω μ σ)/2 ) )

= (σ E0^2 ) / (4 ) * 1 / sqrt( (ω μ σ)/2 )

= (σ E0^2 ) / (4 ) * sqrt( 2 / (ω μ σ) )

= (σ E0^2 ) * sqrt(2) / (4 sqrt( ω μ σ ) )

= ( sqrt(σ) * E0^2 ) * sqrt(2) / (4 sqrt( ω μ ) )

Hmm, maybe this isn't the best approach. Let me compute P_avg numerically.

Given:

σ = 5.96e7 S/m

E0 = 1 V/m

ω = 6.283e6 rad/s

μ = 4πe-7 H/m

So let's compute σ E0^2 = 5.96e7 * (1)^2 = 5.96e7.

Compute denominator: 4 * α. Wait, I need α.

α = sqrt( (ω μ σ)/2 )

Compute ω μ σ:

6.283e6 * 4πe-7 * 5.96e
