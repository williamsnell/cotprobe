Okay, so I have this question about the origins of human aggressive behavior, and I need to figure it out. Hmm, I remember that aggression is a big topic in psychology, and there are different theories about why people act aggressively.

The question is asking about the two main theoretical points of view. I think I remember something about nature versus nurture. Oh wait, but the options might present it differently. Let me think: one theory is that aggression is something we're born with, like an instinct. That's probably the biological or instinctual view. And then another view is that aggression is learned from the environment, like through experiences and learning.

Looking at the options, option A says biological predisposition and environmental triggers. That sounds like it's combining both aspects, but I'm not sure if that's the main two theories. Option B is evolutionary psychology and learned behavior theory. Evolutionary psychology is about instincts, so that's similar to the biological view, and learned behavior is like nurture. So that might be the two main points.

Option C is classical conditioning and operant aggression. Those are both learning theories, so that's more about environmental factors, but I don't think they're the two main opposing views. Theyâ€™re both from the same side, I think.

Option D is social learning theory and innate aggression. Social learning is about learning from others, which is the nurture side, and innate is the nature side. So that could be the two main points.

Option E is hormonal imbalance and cultural aggression. I don't think hormonal imbalance is one of the main theories discussed as a major point. It's more a factor within the biological view.

Option F is nature vs nurture. That's a general concept, but the question is probably looking for more specific theories. So F might be too broad.

Option G, H, I, J are different types of aggression, not the origins or theories about why it happens.

So now I need to decide between A, B, D, and F. The question is about theoretical points of view. So maybe it's either nature (instincts, biology) vs nurture (learning, environment). So the two main theories are the instinctual (or biological) view and the learning (environmental) view.

Option D says social learning theory and innate aggression. Social learning is a type of environmental theory, and innate is the biological side. So D seems to fit.

Option B is evolutionary psychology and learned behavior. Evolutionary is about instincts, and learned is environment. So B also fits.

Wait, what's the difference between B and D? Evolutionary psychology is a specific theory that explains behavior through evolution, including aggression as an adaptive trait. Social learning theory is more about observing and imitating others. So the two main points could be evolutionary (instinct) and social learning (environment). Or it could be more general, like biological vs environmental.

The question asks for the two main theoretical points. I think the broader categories are biological (nature) and environmental (nurture). But looking at the options, F is nature vs nurture, which is the general debate. So maybe F is the answer.

Wait, no, because F is just the general terms, not specific theories. The question is about the theoretical points, which would be specific theories. So between B and D. 

Wait, another thought: the main theories are the instinct theory (like Freud's idea of Thanatos) and the learning theory. Or in another context, it's the biological (including evolutionary) view versus the environmental/learning view.

Option A is biological predisposition and environmental triggers. That's two aspects but perhaps not the two main theories. Because environmental triggers might be part of the same theory. Or maybe it's a way to present both.

Alternatively, the two main theories are the biological (instinct) and the social learning theory. So D could be the answer.

But wait, in the options, D says "social learning theory and innate aggression." So that's two specific theories. So that's one possibility.

But the question is about the two main points of view. So I think the best options are F (nature vs nurture) as the general terms, or D and B as specific theories. 

I'm a bit confused. Let me try to recall. The two main theories are the instinct theory (biological) and the learning theory (environmental). So in the options, D is social learning theory (environmental) and innate (biological). So D would be correct. But B is evolutionary psychology and learned behavior, which is similar.

Wait, another angle: the main points are whether aggression is innate or learned. So among the options, option A says biological and environmental. But that seems to combine both, which might not be the two opposing views. Option F is the nature vs nurture, which is the broader view. But the question is about theoretical points of view, so they might be looking for F.

Alternatively, in some textbooks, the two main theories are the instinct theory and the frustration-aggression hypothesis, but that's not among the options.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. But I think the intended answer is F: nature vs nurture. Because the question is phrased as the two main theoretical points of view, which are the nature and nurture perspectives.

So I'm going to go with F.

The question asks about the two main theoretical points of view on the origins of human aggressive behavior. The key is to identify the broadest and most general perspectives that encompass the debate. 

Option F, "nature vs nurture," represents the overarching theoretical divide, where "nature" refers to biological or innate factors (e.g., instincts, genetics) and "nurture" refers to environmental or learned factors (e.g., social learning, conditioning). This option captures the essence of the debate without narrowing it down to specific theories like evolutionary psychology or social learning theory, which are more detailed explanations within the broader nature-nurture framework.

Other options, such as A, B, and D, present combinations of specific theories or factors, but they do not encapsulate the fundamental theoretical perspectives as comprehensively as F. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is:

F: nature vs nurture

Answer: F
