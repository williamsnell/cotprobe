Alright, so I've got this question about media types and their purposes for advertisers. Let's break it down. The question is asking which type of media helps advertisers demonstrate the benefits of a product and brings life and energy to their message.

Hmm, okay, I remember that different media have different strengths. Let's go through the options one by one. 

Option A is Outdoor advertising. That's like billboards and stuff. Billboards are good for catching attention quickly, but I'm not sure if they're the best at demonstrating product benefits in detail. They're more for quick messages.

Option B is Print media, like newspapers and magazines. Print can provide detailed information, maybe through ads with text. But does it bring life and energy? I mean, print is static, so maybe not as dynamic as other forms.

Option C is Broadcast media. That includes TV and radio. TV can definitely show products in action, like through commercials. They can demonstrate benefits effectively because they can show moving images and sounds, which make the message more lively. Radio is auditory, so it can create energy through sound but might not show benefits as clearly as TV.

Option D is Social media. It's interactive and can have videos, images, and user interactions. Social media can definitely bring energy, especially with trends and engagement. It can show product demos through videos, so that's a possibility.

Option E is Promotional media. I think this refers to things like in-store promotions, coupons, or samples. These are more about encouraging immediate action rather than demonstrating benefits in a dynamic way.

Option F is Interactive media. This would include things like websites, apps, or video games where the user can interact. It's engaging, but I'm not sure if it's specifically about demonstrating product benefits in an energetic way. It's more about user participation.

Option G is Direct mail. That's like sending flyers or letters to people's homes. It's targeted but not really dynamic or energetic. It's more about direct information delivery.

Option H is Support media. Not too sure about this one. Maybe it's media that supports other advertising efforts, like point-of-purchase displays. Not sure how it demonstrates benefits energetically.

Option I is Public relations media. This involves things like press releases, events, and word of mouth. It's more about building reputation and trust rather than directly demonstrating product benefits in a lively way.

Option J is Digital media. That's a broad category including social media, websites, online ads. Digital can be interactive and dynamic, so it can bring energy. But the question is about demonstrating benefits, which could be done through video content, for example.

Wait, the question is about demonstrating benefits and bringing life/energy. Broadcast media, especially TV, can do this through moving images and sound, making the message more engaging. Social media and digital media can also do this, but maybe broadcast is the more traditional answer here.

So, which one is better? The question is a bit tricky because multiple options could fit. But I think the key here is that broadcast media, like TV commercials, are known for their ability to show products in action, making the benefits clear and engaging. They can tell a story, which brings energy to the message.

Alternatively, social media can do this too, especially with video content. But I'm trying to remember what each media type is typically used for. Broadcast media is more about reaching a broad audience with rich content, while social media is more about interaction and targeting.

Wait, the question is about demonstrating benefits and bringing life. So, maybe broadcast media is the answer because it's more about showing the product in action through video and audio, which is more dynamic than static print or direct mail.

So I'm leaning towards option C: Broadcast media.
