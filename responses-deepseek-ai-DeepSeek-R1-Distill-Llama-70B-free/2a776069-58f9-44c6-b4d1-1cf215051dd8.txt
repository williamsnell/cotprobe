Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about the effect of an inert gas on the equilibrium composition of a mixture. The setup is that we have an initial mixture of 0.5 moles of carbon monoxide (CO) and 2.38 moles of air. We need to calculate the composition at equilibrium when the temperature is 3,000 K and the pressure is 1 atm. The options given are from A to J, each giving a different amount of CO at equilibrium.

Hmm, wait a second. I remember that when inert gases are added to a reaction mixture, they don't participate in the chemical reaction. But their presence can affect the equilibrium if the pressure or concentration is changed. But in this case, the pressure is fixed at 1 atm, so maybe the addition of an inert gas doesn't change the partial pressures of the reacting species? Or does it?

Wait, the initial mixture is CO and air. Air is mostly nitrogen and oxygen, right? So in this context, maybe the air is acting as an inert gas because, at high temperatures, CO might react with something else. Or perhaps the air is part of a reaction. Oh wait, maybe I'm missing the reaction here. Because without knowing the reaction, it's hard to find the equilibrium.

Wait, the problem mentions the effect of inert gas. So I think the reaction is something involving CO. Maybe the CO is either being formed or consumed. Oh, perhaps the reaction is CO(g) + H2O(g) ↔ CO2(g) + H2(g), but wait, in that case, H2O isn't present here. Alternatively, maybe CO is decomposing or something else.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The initial mixture is CO and air. At high temperature, perhaps CO reacts with oxygen from the air. Oh, right! Carbon monoxide burns in oxygen to form carbon dioxide. So the reaction would be 2 CO + O2 → 2 CO2. But wait, in the air, oxygen is present. So maybe the reaction is CO + O2 → CO2, but let me get the stoichiometry right.

Wait, actually, the correct balanced equation for CO burning in O2 is 2 CO + O2 → 2 CO2. So that's the reaction. Now, the initial moles are 0.5 moles of CO and 2.38 moles of air. Wait, but what's the composition of air? Air is approximately 79% nitrogen (N2), 20% O2, and 1% other gases. So for 2.38 moles of air, the moles of O2 would be about 0.2 * 2.38 = 0.476 moles. The rest is mostly N2, which is inert.

So the initial moles of O2 are about 0.476 moles. Now, the question is, at 3000 K and 1 atm, what's the equilibrium composition? But wait, the problem says the effect of inert gas on equilibrium. So maybe the presence of N2 (which is inert) affects the total pressure but not the partial pressures of the reacting species because pressure is kept constant.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think about Le Chatelier's principle. If we add an inert gas at constant volume, the total pressure increases, but the partial pressures remain the same. So the equilibrium isn't shifted. However, if the pressure is kept constant, adding an inert gas would require the volume to increase, which would lower the partial pressures of the reacting gases, possibly shifting the equilibrium.

But wait, in this problem, the pressure is fixed at 1 atm. So the system is under constant pressure conditions. So when you add an inert gas, the volume adjusts to maintain the pressure. Therefore, the partial pressures of the reacting species (CO and O2) would decrease because the total moles increase, leading to a shift in equilibrium.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should consider whether the inert gas affects the equilibrium. Since the reaction is 2 CO + O2 → 2 CO2, the equilibrium constant Kp would depend on partial pressures. At a fixed temperature, Kp is constant. So the presence of inert gases doesn't change Kp, but it could affect the partial pressures if the system's volume changes.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the presence of air (as inert) doesn't affect the reaction, meaning the inert gas doesn't participate, so the equilibrium is determined solely by the reacting species. Wait, but the initial moles include CO and O2 from the air. So maybe the reaction proceeds as normal, with the O2 being a reactant.

Wait, but the problem is asking about the effect of inert gas. So perhaps the presence of N2 (from air) as an inert gas doesn't change the partial pressures of CO and O2 because the total pressure is fixed. Or maybe, since pressure is fixed, the presence of an inert gas doesn't affect the reaction quotient Q, so the system adjusts to reach the same Kp as without the inert gas.

I think I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to outline the steps I should follow.

1. Write down the reaction and its equilibrium expression.
2. Determine the initial moles of each reactant and product.
3. Set up the ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium).
4. Use the equilibrium constant (K) at 3000 K to find the equilibrium composition.

Wait, but I don't have the value of K for the reaction at 3000 K. Hmm, that complicates things. Because without K, I can't compute the exact changes. So maybe the problem is testing something else. Oh wait, perhaps the reaction goes to completion, but that's probably not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the inert gas doesn't affect the equilibrium because it doesn't take part in the reaction. So the equilibrium composition is determined based solely on the initial moles of CO and O2, ignoring the inert gases. But I'm not sure.

Wait, but the options given are specific amounts of CO at equilibrium. So perhaps the reaction goes to completion, but that depends on K. At high temperatures, the equilibrium might favor reactants or products based on the reaction's exothermicity or endothermicity.

Wait, the reaction 2 CO + O2 → 2 CO2 is exothermic. Because forming CO2 releases heat. So at high temperatures (3000 K is very high), the equilibrium would shift toward the reactants because Le Chatelier's principle says that increasing temperature favors endothermic reactions. So for an exothermic reaction, high T shifts to the left, favoring reactants.

So if the reaction is exothermic, at higher T, K decreases. So at 3000 K, K would be lower than at lower temperatures, meaning less product formation.

But without knowing the exact K value, I can't compute the exact mole amounts. So perhaps the problem is a trick question, implying that the inert gas's presence doesn't affect the equilibrium because we're at constant pressure. So the mole fractions of CO and O2 determine the equilibrium, and the inert gas doesn't change their partial pressures because pressure is fixed.

Wait, but when you add an inert gas at constant pressure, the volume increases, which would decrease the partial pressures of all gases, including CO and O2. According to Le Chatelier, the system would shift to counteract that. But I'm not sure how that affects the position of equilibrium.

Alternatively, perhaps because the total pressure is fixed, adding an inert gas doesn't affect the partial pressures of the reacting species. Because the partial pressure is (mole fraction) × total pressure. But if you add more moles (inert gas), the mole fractions of CO and O2 decrease, which would lower their partial pressures. So the reaction quotient Q would change, causing the system to shift to counteract that.

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach: let's consider the initial moles of CO and O2. The air is 2.38 moles, so O2 is about 0.476 moles. So initial moles:

CO: 0.5 mol
O2: 0.476 mol
CO2: 0 mol (assuming no CO2 initially)

The reaction is 2 CO + O2 → 2 CO2.

At equilibrium, let's let the change be -2x for CO, -x for O2, and +2x for CO2.

So equilibrium moles would be:

CO: 0.5 - 2x
O2: 0.476 - x
CO2: 2x

The total moles at equilibrium would be (0.5-2x) + (0.476 -x) + 2x + moles of inert gases.

Wait, but the inert gas (N2) is 2.38 - 0.476 = 1.904 moles. So total moles = (0.5 -2x) + (0.476 -x) + 2x + 1.904 = 0.5 + 0.476 + 1.904 = 2.88 moles.

Wait, but since pressure is constant, the volume adjusts to keep pressure constant. So the partial pressures would be (moles of each species) × (RT/V). But since the total pressure is fixed, the partial pressure of each species is (n_i / n_total) × P_total.

So for CO, partial pressure is (0.5 - 2x) / 2.88 * 1 atm.

Similarly for O2: (0.476 - x)/2.88 * 1 atm.

And for CO2: (2x)/2.88 * 1 atm.

The equilibrium expression for Kp would be:

Kp = (P_CO2)^2 / (P_CO^2 * P_O2)

Plugging in:

Kp = [(2x/2.88)]^2 / [ ( (0.5-2x)/2.88 )^2 * ( (0.476 -x)/2.88 ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

The denominators (2.88) will cancel out because each term in the denominator and numerator has it raised to some power.

So Kp = [ (2x)^2 ] / [ (0.5-2x)^2 * (0.476 -x) ) ]

But wait, without knowing Kp at 3000 K, I can't solve for x. So maybe this approach isn't the way to go.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is simpler. If the inert gas doesn't affect the reaction, then the equilibrium is determined solely by the initial moles of CO and O2. But then again, without knowing K, I can't compute it.

Wait, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed at all because the temperature is too high. But that doesn't make sense because CO and O2 can react at high temperatures.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the inert gas doesn't affect the reaction, so the equilibrium is the same as if the inert gas wasn't present. But again, without K, I can't compute x.

Wait, perhaps the problem is a trick question. Since the pressure is constant and the inert gas doesn't react, the presence of the inert gas doesn't change the partial pressures of the reacting species. Therefore, the equilibrium composition is the same as if the inert gas wasn't present.

But that can't be right because adding an inert gas at constant pressure would change the volume, thus changing the concentrations or partial pressures.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering that the total pressure remains at 1 atm, so the partial pressures of the reacting species adjust based on their mole fractions. But without knowing K, it's tough.

Wait, perhaps the question is expecting me to realize that the inert gas doesn't affect the reaction, so the moles of CO at equilibrium remain the same as the initial. But looking at the options, option B is 0.5 moles of CO. So that's the initial amount. But that would imply that the reaction didn't proceed at all, which might be the case if K is very small at high T.

Alternatively, since the reaction is exothermic, high T reduces K, so less CO2 is formed. So maybe the reaction doesn't proceed much, and the CO remains around 0.5 moles. So option B would be correct.

But wait, what if the reaction goes to the left? No, the reaction is 2 CO + O2 → 2 CO2. If K is small, the reverse reaction is favored, meaning more reactants. So CO and O2 would be consumed less, so the moles of CO would stay close to initial.

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps without knowing K, the only way is to assume that the inert gas doesn't affect the equilibrium, so the moles of CO remain the same. So the answer would be B: 0.5 moles.

But wait, another possibility: since the pressure is fixed, adding inert gas (N2) increases the total moles, which would lower the partial pressures of CO and O2. According to Le Chatelier, the system would shift to the right to try to increase the pressure, but since the reaction is 2 CO + O2 → 2 CO2, which has fewer moles (2 moles of CO2 vs 2 +1=3 moles of reactants), increasing pressure would shift it to the right. Wait, but if the partial pressures of CO and O2 decrease, that's equivalent to lowering the pressure, which would shift the equilibrium to the left, favoring more reactants. Hmm, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the inert gas doesn't affect the equilibrium because the partial pressures are determined by the reacting species only. So the moles of CO at equilibrium are determined as if the inert gas wasn't present. But again, without K, I can't calculate it.

Wait, maybe the reaction doesn't proceed because the activation energy is too high at 3000 K, but that doesn't make sense because higher temperatures usually increase reaction rates.

I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think about the options. The initial moles of CO are 0.5. If the reaction proceeds, CO would decrease. But if K is small, then CO wouldn't decrease much. So the moles of CO at equilibrium might be close to 0.5. Looking at the options, B is 0.5, which seems plausible if the reaction doesn't proceed much. Alternatively, if the reaction goes to completion, CO would be 0, but that's not in the options.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the total pressure is 1 atm, and the moles of inert gas (N2) are 1.904 (since air is 2.38 moles, O2 is 0.476, so N2 is 2.38 -0.476 = 1.904). So the total moles initially are 0.5 (CO) + 0.476 (O2) + 1.904 (N2) = 2.88 moles. At equilibrium, the total moles would change based on the reaction.

If reaction proceeds to form CO2, the moles would decrease because 3 moles of reactants (2 CO + 1 O2) form 2 moles of CO2, so total moles decrease by 1 per 1 O2 consumed. But without K, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is more straightforward. Since the inert gas doesn't react, the presence of air (which is mostly inert N2) doesn't affect the reaction between CO and O2. So the equilibrium is determined by the initial moles of CO and O2 only, and the N2 is just along for the ride, not affecting the partial pressures because pressure is fixed.

So, the reaction is 2 CO + O2 ↔ 2 CO2. Initial moles: CO =0.5, O2=0.476, CO2=0.

But let's set up the ICE table without considering the inert gas because it doesn't affect the reaction.

Let me define the change as:

Initial:
CO: 0.5
O2: 0.476
CO2: 0

Change:
CO: -2x
O2: -x
CO2: +2x

Equilibrium:
CO: 0.5 - 2x
O2: 0.476 -x
CO2: 2x

Total moles of reacting species: (0.5-2x) + (0.476 -x) + 2x = 0.976 -2x

Wait, but the total pressure is fixed at 1 atm. The partial pressures would be (moles of each species) divided by total moles of all species (including inert) multiplied by P_total.

Wait, the total moles including inert is (0.5-2x) + (0.476 -x) + 2x + 1.904 = 0.5 + 0.476 + 1.904 = 2.88 moles (since the x terms cancel out: -2x -x +2x = -x? Wait, no:

Wait, the initial total moles are 0.5 CO + 2.38 air.

Air is 2.38 moles, which is 0.476 O2 and 1.904 N2.

So initial total moles: 0.5 + 0.476 + 1.904 = 2.88 moles.

After reaction, the moles are:

CO: 0.5 -2x

O2: 0.476 -x

CO2: 2x

N2: 1.904

Total moles = (0.5-2x) + (0.476 -x) + 2x + 1.904 = 0.5 + 0.476 +1.904 + (-2x -x +2x) )= 2.88 -x.

So the total moles at equilibrium are 2.88 - x.

But since pressure is fixed at 1 atm, the partial pressures are:

P_CO = (0.5 -2x) / (2.88 -x) ) * 1 atm

P_O2 = (0.476 -x) / (2.88 -x) ) *1 atm

P_CO2 = (2x) / (2.88 -x) ) *1 atm

The equilibrium expression is Kp = (P_CO2)^2 / (P_CO^2 * P_O2)

So,

Kp = [ (2x/(2.88 -x))^2 ] / [ ( (0.5 -2x)/(2.88 -x) )^2 * ( (0.476 -x)/(2.88 -x) ) ) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

The denominators (2.88 -x) would cancel in a way. Let's see:

Numerator: (2x)^2 /
