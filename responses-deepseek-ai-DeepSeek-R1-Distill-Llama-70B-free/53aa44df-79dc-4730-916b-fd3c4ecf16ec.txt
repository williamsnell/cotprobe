Okay, so I've got this problem here about Coach Wu and his soccer balls. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

Alright, the problem says Coach Wu has a total of 30 soccer balls. Out of these, 9 are white. So, the first thing I should probably do is subtract those white balls from the total to find out how many are left. Let me do that math: 30 total minus 9 white equals 21 soccer balls that are other colors. 

Now, the remaining 21 balls are either blue, pink, or green. And the important thing here is that there's an equal number of each of these three colors. So, if they're all the same number, I can just divide the remaining 21 by 3 to find out how many there are of each color. 

Let me calculate that: 21 divided by 3 is 7. So that would mean there are 7 blue, 7 pink, and 7 green soccer balls. 

Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, 9 white plus 7 blue plus 7 pink plus 7 green. Adding those up: 9 plus 7 is 16, plus another 7 is 23, and then plus the last 7 makes 30. Oh wait, no, that doesn't add up correctly. Wait, 9 plus 7 is 16, plus 7 is 23, plus 7 is 30. Oh wait, no, 9 + (7*3) is 9 +21=30. Yeah, that works. So each color has 7 balls. 

So the question is asking specifically for the number of green balls, which would be 7. Let me look at the options. Option I is 7, so that must be the correct answer.

The total number of soccer balls Coach Wu has is 30, with 9 being white. Subtracting these, there are 21 soccer balls left that are either blue, pink, or green. Since these three colors are equally represented, dividing 21 by 3 gives 7. Therefore, there are 7 green soccer balls.

The correct answer is I.
