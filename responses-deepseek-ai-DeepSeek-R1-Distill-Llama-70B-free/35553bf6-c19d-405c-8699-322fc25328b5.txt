Okay, so I have this question here about decimal numbers and their binary representations. The question asks which of the given options has an exact representation in binary. Hmm, I remember that not all decimal fractions can be exactly represented in binary. Let me think about how binary fractions work.

So, in binary, fractions are represented as sums of negative powers of 2. Like, the first place after the decimal is 1/2, then 1/4, 1/8, and so on. So for a decimal to convert exactly into binary, it must be a sum of a finite number of these fractions.

Wait, wait. So for example, 0.5 in decimal is 1/2, which is exactly 0.1 in binary. That makes sense. But numbers like 0.3 or 0.1 in decimal can't be expressed exactly because they'd require an infinite series of bits. So the key is to find which of these options can be written as a finite sum of 1/(2^n) terms.

Let me look at the options one by one.

Option A: 0.8. Hmm, 0.8 is 8/10, which simplifies to 4/5. Can that be expressed as a finite binary fraction? I'm not sure. Let me try converting it.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of binary. Let's see, 0.8 in binary. Wait, 0.8 is equal to 4/5. Let me try to write 4/5 as a sum of fractions with denominators that are powers of 2. Hmm, 4/5 is 0.8, which is 0.5 + 0.25 + 0.05? Wait, no, that doesn't add up right. Maybe another approach.

Wait, I think the best way is to actually convert each decimal to binary and see which terminates. Because if the binary representation terminates, it's exact.

So, let's start with Option A: 0.8.

To convert 0.8 to binary, I multiply by 2. 0.8 * 2 = 1.6. The integer part is 1, so the first bit is 1. Subtract 1, you get 0.6. Multiply by 2 again: 1.2. Next bit is 1, subtract 1, remainder 0.2.

0.2 * 2 = 0.4. Bit is 0. Then 0.4 *2=0.8. Bit is 0. Then 0.8*2=1.6, bit 1. Subtract 1 gives 0.6 again. Wait, this is starting to loop. So the binary would be 0.1100110011..., which repeats. So it's a repeating fraction, meaning it's not exact. So A isn't the right answer.

Option B: 0.3. I think this is a non-terminating. Let me try. 0.3 *2=0.6 → 0. Next, 0.6*2=1.2 → 1, then 0.2. 0.2*2=0.4 → 0. 0.4*2=0.8 →0. 0.8*2=1.6 →1, remainder 0.6. That's the same as before, so it's going to loop. So 0.3 in binary is 0.0100110011..., repeating. So B is out.

Option C:0.9. Let's try. 0.9*2=1.8 →1, remainder 0.8. Then same as A. So the binary would be 0.11100110011..., which repeats. So C is also non-terminating.

Option D: 0.2. Let's convert. 0.2*2=0.4 →0. 0.4*2=0.8 →0. 0.8*2=1.6 →1, remainder 0.6. Then same as before. So the binary is 0.001100110..., which repeats. So D is not exact.

Option E: 0.1. That's a classic. I remember 0.1 in decimal is a repeating fraction in binary. Let me check. 0.1*2=0.2 →0. 0.2*2=0.4 →0. 0.4*2=0.8 →0. 0.8*2=1.6 →1, remainder 0.6. Then same as before. So it's 0.000110011..., repeating. So E is out.

Option F: 0.7. Let's see. 0.7*2=1.4 →1, remainder 0.4. 0.4*2=0.8 →0. 0.8*2=1.6 →1, remainder 0.6. Then same as before, so it repeats. So 0.7 is 0.101100110..., which doesn't terminate. So F is not exact.

Option G: 0.6. Hmm. Let's try. 0.6*2=1.2 →1, remainder 0.2. 0.2*2=0.4 →0. 0.4*2=0.8 →0. 0.8*2=1.6 →1, rem 0.6. So it loops. So 0.6 is 0.100110011..., repeating. So G is out.

Option H: 0.5. Oh wait, 0.5 is 1/2, which is 0.1 in binary. That's exact. So H would be the correct answer.

Option I: 0.4. Let's check. 0.4*2=0.8 →0. 0.8*2=1.6 →1, rem 0.6. Then same as before. So 0.4 is 0.01100110011..., which repeats. So I is out.

So the only option where the binary terminates is H: 0.5.

To determine which decimal number has an exact representation in binary notation, we need to understand that a decimal fraction can be exactly represented in binary if and only if it can be expressed as a finite sum of negative powers of 2. This means the binary representation must terminate after a finite number of digits.
