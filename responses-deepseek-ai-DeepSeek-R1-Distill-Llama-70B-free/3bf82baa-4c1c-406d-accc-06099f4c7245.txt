Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the theoretical speed of sound in hydrogen at 0°C. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

First, I remember that the speed of sound in a gas depends on the type of gas and some properties like its molar mass and the temperature. Oh right, there's this formula for the speed of sound in an ideal gas. I think it's something like v equals the square root of (gamma times R times T) divided by M, where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and M is the molar mass.

Wait, let me get that formula straight. I think the speed of sound (v) is given by v = sqrt(γ * R * T / M), where γ is the adiabatic index or the heat capacity ratio (Cp/Cv). Since hydrogen is a diatomic gas, I remember that γ is 1.40 for diatomic gases at room temperature. Oh, and M is the molar mass, which here is given as 2.016 g/mol. Oh wait, I need to make sure the units match. The gas constant R is usually in J/(mol·K), so the units for M should be in kg/mol. So I'll need to convert 2.016 g/mol to kg/mol. That's 2.016 grams per mole divided by 1000, which gives 0.002016 kg/mol.

The temperature is 0°C, which in Kelvin is 273.15 K. Okay, so T is 273 K. R, the universal gas constant, is 8.314 J/(mol·K) if I recall correctly.

So putting it all together, v equals the square root of (γ * R * T) divided by M. Let me plug in the numbers. γ is 1.40, R is 8.314, T is 273, and M is 0.002016.

Calculating inside the square root first: 1.40 * 8.314 = let's see, 1.4 * 8 is 11.2, and 1.4 * 0.314 is about 0.44, so total around 11.64. Then multiply by T, which is 273: 11.64 * 273. Hmm, 11 * 273 is about 3003, and 0.64 * 273 is around 174.72, so total would be approximately 3177.72.

Wait, maybe I should do it more accurately. Let me compute 1.40 * 8.314 first. 8 * 1.4 is 11.2, 0.314 * 1.4 is 0.44, so yes, 11.64. Then 11.64 * 273. Let's break that down: 273 * 10 is 2730, 273 * 1.64 is... 273 * 1 is 273, 273 * 0.64 is about 174.72. So 2730 + 273 + 174.72 = 2730 + 447.72 = 3177.72. So the numerator inside the square root is approximately 3177.72.

Now, the denominator is M, which is 0.002016 kg/mol. So 3177.72 divided by 0.002016. Let me compute that. Hmm, 3177.72 / 0.002016. Well, 3177.72 divided by 0.002 is 1,588,860, but since it's 0.002016, which is a bit larger, the result would be a bit smaller. Let me compute it more precisely.

Alternatively, since dividing by 0.002016 is the same as multiplying by 1/0.002016. Let me compute 1 / 0.002016. 0.002 is 2e-3, so 1/0.002 is 500. But 0.002016 is 2.016e-3, so 1/(2.016e-3) is approximately 496.03, because 2.016 * 496 is about 1000 (since 2 * 496 = 992, and 0.016 * 496 = ~7.936, so total 999.936, which is almost 1000). So 1/0.002016 ≈ 496.03.

So 3177.72 * 496.03. That's a big number. Let me approximate. 3177.72 * 500 is 1,588,860. But since it's 496.03, which is 3.97 less than 500, so subtract 3177.72 * 3.97. Let's compute 3177.72 * 4 = 12,710.88, so 3177.72 * 3.97 is about 12,710.88 minus 3177.72 * 0.03, which is 95.33. So 12,710.88 - 95.33 = 12,615.55. So subtracting that from 1,588,860 gives 1,588,860 - 12,615.55 = 1,576,244.45.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, I could compute 3177.72 * 496.03 by breaking it down. Maybe I should use a calculator approach, but since I'm doing this by hand, perhaps it's better to note that this product is approximately 1,576,000 or so.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation. Let me try another approach. Let's compute 3177.72 * 496.03.

Another method: 3177.72 * 496.03 = ?

Well, 3177.72 * 400 = 1,271,088.

3177.72 * 90 = 286, (wait, 3177.72 * 90 = 286,  let's compute 3177.72 * 90: 3177.72 * 9 = 28,599.48, so 28,599.48 * 10 = 285,994.8.

3177.72 * 6 = 19,066.32.

3177.72 * 0.03 = 95.3316.

So adding all these together:

1,271,088 (from 400) 
+ 285,994.8 (from 90) 
= 1,557,082.8

+ 19,066.32 (from 6) 
= 1,576,149.12

+ 95.3316 (from 0.03) 
= 1,576,244.4516.

So the product is approximately 1,576,244.45. So that's the value inside the square root: sqrt(1,576,244.45).

What's the square root of 1,576,244? Hmm, I know that 1256 squared is 1,577,536 because 1200^2 is 1,440,000, and 50^2 is 2500, but 1256^2: let's see 1250^2 is 1,562,500. Then 1256^2 is (1250 +6)^2 = 1250^2 + 2*1250*6 +6^2 = 1,562,500 +15,000 +36 = 1,577,536. So our number is 1,576,244.45, which is just a bit less than 1,577,536. So the square root is just a bit less than 1256.

Wait, 1256^2 = 1,577,536.

1,577,536 minus 1,576,244.45 equals 1,291.55.

So 1,576,244.45 is 1,291.55 less than 1,577,536. So how much less? Let me find x such that (1256 - x)^2 = 1,576,244.45.

Expanding (a - b)^2 = a² - 2ab + b². So 1256² - 2*1256*x + x² = 1,576,244.45.

We know 1256^2 is 1,577,536. So 1,577,536 - 2512 x + x² = 1,576,244.45.

Subtract 1,576,244.45 from both sides: 1,577,536 - 1,576,244.45 = 2512x - x².

Which is 1,291.55 = 2512x - x².

Assuming x is small, x² is negligible, so 2512x ≈ 1,291.55 → x ≈ 1,291.55 / 2512 ≈ 0.514.

So x is approximately 0.514. So the square root is 1256 - 0.514 ≈ 1255.486.

So the speed of sound is approximately 1255.49 m/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check them. The options are:

A: 1.00e3 → 1000 m/s

B: 1.60e3 → 1600

C:1.25e3 →1250

D:1.50e3→1500

E:2.00e3 →2000

F:1.75e3→1750

G:1.45e3→1450

H:1.10e3→1100

I:900e3→900,000, which can't be right.

J:800e3→800,000, nope.

Wait, so the calculation I did gave me around 1255 m/s, which is closest to option C, which is 1.25e3 or 1250 m/s.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake. Let me recount the steps.

The formula: v = sqrt(γ R T / M)

γ is 1.4, R is 8.314 J/mol·K, T is 273 K, M is 2.016 g/mol → 0.002016 kg/mol.

So let me compute γ*R*T/M.

Compute each part:

γ * R = 1.4 * 8.314 = let's compute 8 * 1.4 = 11.2, 0.314 *1.4=0.44, so total 11.64.

Then 11.64 * T = 11.64 * 273 = Let me compute that accurately.

11 * 273 = 3003.

0.64 * 273 = let's compute 0.6 *273=163.8, 0.04 *273=10.92 → total 174.72.

So 3003 + 174.72 = 3177.72.

Then 3177.72 divided by M, which is 0.002016 kg/mol.

3177.72 / 0.002016 → let me compute this division more accurately.

Alternatively, 3177.72 / 0.002016 = 3177720 / 2.016.

Wait, that's 3,177,720 ÷ 2.016.

Let me compute 3177720 ÷ 2.016.

2.016 * 1,576,000 = ?

Wait, 2.016 * 1,000,000 = 2,016,000.

So 2.016 * 1,576,000 = 2.016 * (1,500,000 + 76,000) = 2.016*1.5e6 + 2.016*7.6e4.

2.016 * 1.5e6 = 3,024,000.

2.016 *7.6e4 → 2.016 *76,000.

2.016 *76,000: 2*76,000=152,000; 0.016*76,000=1,216. So total 152,000 +1,216=153,216.

So 3,024,000 +153,216=3,177,216.

So 2.016 * 1,576,000 = 3,177,216, which is very close to 3,177,720.

So 3,177,720 -3,177,216=504.

So 2.016 * x =504 → x=504/2.016 ≈ 250. So 504 /2.016: 2.016 *250=504, yes. So total is 1,576,000 +250=1,576,250.

Wait, that's 3,177,720 ÷2.016=1,576,250.

So the value inside sqrt is 1,576,250.

So sqrt(1,576,250) → let's see, as before, 1256^2=1,577,536, so 1,576,250 is 1,577,536 minus 1,286.

Wait, 1,577,536 -1,576,250=1,286.

So sqrt(1,576,250) is 1256 minus some amount. Let's find x where (1256 -x)^2=1,576,250.

Expanding: 1256² - 2*1256*x +x²=1,576,250.

1256² is 1,577,536, so 1,577,536 -2512x +x²=1,576,250.

Subtract 1,576,250: 1,577,536-1,576,250=1,286=2512x -x².

Assume x is small, so x² is negligible: 2512x≈1,286 →x≈1,286/2512≈0.512.

So x≈0.512. So sqrt is 1256 -0.512 ≈1255.488 m/s.

So approximately 1255.5 m/s. Looking at the options, option C is 1.25e3 →1250 m/s, which is very close.

Wait, but I thought the speed of sound in hydrogen is higher than that. Wait, wait, I might have made a mistake in units somewhere.

Wait, let me double-check the units. The molar mass M was given as 2.016 g/mol, which I converted to kg/mol correctly as 0.002016 kg/mol. R is in J/(mol·K), which is correct. T is in Kelvin, correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using more precise numbers. Let me compute γ*R*T/M more accurately.

γ=1.4, R=8.314, T=273.15 K (more precise).

Compute numerator: 1.4 *8.314 *273.15.

Compute 1.4 *8.314 first: 8 *1.4=11.2, 0.314*1.4=0.44, so 11.64.

11.64 *273.15 → let's compute 11 *273.15= 3,004.65; 0.64 *273.15= 174.816; total 3,004.65 +174.816=3,179.466.

So numerator is 3,179.466.

Denominator is M=0.002016 kg/mol.

So 3,179.466 / 0.002016 = ?

3,179.466 ÷ 0.002016 = 3,179.466 * (1/0.002016) = 3,179.466 * 496.03 ≈ ?

Compute 3,179.466 *496.03:

Let me do this as (3,000 + 179.466) * 496.03.

3,000 *496.03 = 1,488,090.

179.466 *496.03 → let's approximate this:

179 *500 =89,500, but subtract 179*(3.97)= approx 711. So 89,500 -711=88,789.

So 1,488,090 +88,789=1,576,879.

So the product is approximately 1,576,879. So sqrt(1,576,879) is around 1255.5 m/s.

So that's 1,255.5 m/s, which rounds to 1.26e3 m/s. But the closest option is C:1.25e3.

Wait, but wait, another thought: the speed of sound in hydrogen is actually known to be higher than in other gases because of its low molar mass. Wait, I thought it's around 1300 m/s or so. Hmm, maybe I should check if the formula is correct.

Wait, I think the formula is correct, but perhaps I made an error in calculation. Let me check R again. R is 8.314 J/(mol·K). Yes.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the speed using another approach. I remember that the speed of sound can also be approximated using v = 20.05 * sqrt(γ*T/M), but that's when using certain units. Wait, maybe that's when M is in atomic mass units or something else. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula v = (1310 m/s) * sqrt( (T/273) * (1/M) ) , but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: for an ideal gas, the speed of sound is given by v = sqrt(γRT/M). So plugging in the numbers correctly, I get around 1255 m/s, which is option C.

But wait, I've heard that hydrogen has a higher speed of sound than that. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the calculation was correct, and the options have option C as 1250, which is close enough.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use M in g/mol without converting, but that would be wrong because R is in J/(mol·K), which uses kg.

Wait, let's see: M in kg is 0.002016 kg/mol.

Yes, so the calculation is correct.

So the correct answer should be option C, 1.25e3 m/s.
</think>

To determine the theoretical speed of sound in hydrogen at 0°C, we use the formula for the speed of sound in an ideal gas:

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{\gamma R T}{M}}
\]

Where:  
- \( \gamma \) is the adiabatic index (1.40 for diatomic gases like hydrogen),  
- \( R \) is the universal gas constant (\( 8.314 \, \text{J/(mol·K)} \)),  
- \( T \
