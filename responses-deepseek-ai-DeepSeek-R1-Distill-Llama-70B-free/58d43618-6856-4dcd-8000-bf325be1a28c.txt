Okay, so I'm trying to answer this philosophy question about Derek Parfit and what Taurek and Lewis assume regarding the sum of pain. Hmm, I remember that Parfit discusses these thinkers in the context of moral philosophy, particularly in relation to utilitarianism and the idea of aggregating happiness or suffering.

Wait, the question is about what both Taurek and Lewis assume for a "sum of pain" to exist. So, I think Taurek is known for his argument against the utilitarian approach in cases where you can't help everyone. Like, he says that numbers don't matter in certain situations, and we should treat each person's claims separately. But how does that relate to the sum of pain?

Lewis, on the other hand, I'm less sure about. Oh wait, maybe it's David Lewis? He's a philosopher known for his work in various areas, including ethics. But I'm not exactly recalling his stance on this particular issue. Maybe I should focus more on Taurek and what Parfit says about him.

Parfit, in his book "Reasons and Persons," discusses the "Mere Addition Paradox" and different views on aggregation. He talks about how some people, like utilitarians, believe that you can simply add up the happiness or suffering of different individuals to determine the moral good. But others, like Taurek, might have different assumptions.

Taurek's argument, as I remember, is that when you have to choose between saving a larger or smaller number of people, the utilitarian approach of maximizing the number saved isn't the right approach. He believes in a more individualistic approach, where each person's loss is significant on their own, and you shouldn't just add them up because that might lead to ignoring the individual's inherent value.

So, for a sum of pain to exist, Taurek and Lewis must assume something about how those pains are experienced. One of the options mentions that the pain must all be felt by a single person. That rings a bell. Because if you can't compare or sum the pain across different individuals, then perhaps the assumption is that the only way to have a sum is if it's all in one person. Otherwise, you can't really add them up meaningfully.

Looking at the options, option E says "all felt by a single person." That makes sense because if the pain is spread across multiple people, their individual pains can't be simply summed, according to non-utilitarian views. So, Taurek and Lewis would assume that for a sum to exist, the pain must be experienced by one person, not distributed among many.

I think that's the right approach. So the correct answer should be E.
