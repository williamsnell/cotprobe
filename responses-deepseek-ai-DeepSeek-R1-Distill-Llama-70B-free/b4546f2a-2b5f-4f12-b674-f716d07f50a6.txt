Question:

Explain how the reduced personal risk of corporate organi-zation allows for greater efficiency.

Options:

A: Personal risk is reduced because corporate efficiency is directly tied to government subsidies.
B: Investors are less likely to undertake great risk if their personal liability is limited.
C: Corporate organization allows for risk to be shared among many individuals, leading to inefficiency due to too many decision-makers.
D: The risk in corporate organization limits efficiency.
E: Corporate structures eliminate all financial risks for investors, promoting reckless investment strategies.
F: The reduced personal risk is a byproduct of corporate taxation, which is the real driver of efficiency.
G: Efficient production means small-scale production.
H: Investors face increased personal risk in corporate organizations, which deters investment and reduces efficiency.
I: Limited liability feature of corporate organization induces investors to undertake the large risks necessary for large-scale production and efficiency.
J: Reduced personal risk comes from the ability to transfer shares easily, which has no impact on efficiency.

Okay, so I have this question about corporate organization and how reduced personal risk leads to greater efficiency. Hmm, I remember from my economics class that corporations have something called limited liability. Oh right, that means if the company goes bankrupt, the investors don't lose more than what they put in. They can't be held personally liable beyond their investment.

The question is asking how this reduced risk makes the corporate structure more efficient. So, if people aren't risking their personal assets, they might be more willing to invest. More investment can lead to bigger projects and more efficient production because you can pool resources from many investors. 

Looking at the options, I need to find the one that connects limited liability with increased willingness to take on necessary risks for efficiency.

Option A says personal risk is reduced because of government subsidies. I don't think that's right. Subsidies are a different topic and not directly about personal liability.

Option B: Investors are less likely to take risks if personal liability is limited. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If liability is limited, they should be more willing to take risks, not less. So B might be the opposite of the correct answer.

Option C: Risk is shared, leading to inefficiency because too many decision-makers. Hmm, sharing risk is good, but does it lead to inefficiency? I thought that with a corporation, you have a centralized management, so maybe not too many decision-makers. Plus, the question is about efficiency, so C seems incorrect.

Option D: Risk limits efficiency. That sounds backwards. Less risk should allow for more efficiency, not limit it.

Option E: Corporations eliminate all financial risks, leading to reckless investments. Wait, no, limited liability doesn't eliminate all risks, just personal liability beyond investment. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Reduced risk is due to corporate taxation. I don't think taxes directly reduce personal risk. It's more about liability, not taxes. So F isn't right.

Option G: Efficient production is small-scale. No, efficient usually means large-scale, so G is wrong.

Option H: Investors face increased risk, which deters investment. That's the opposite of what I know. Limited liability decreases personal risk, so H is incorrect.

Option I: Limited liability induces investors to take necessary risks for large-scale production and efficiency. Yes, that sounds right. Because they're not personally liable beyond their investment, they're more likely to invest larger amounts, leading to big, efficient operations.

Option J: Reduced risk is from transferring shares easily, which doesn't affect efficiency. Transferring shares is about liquidity, not directly about risk and efficiency. So J is probably not the answer.

So the correct answer should be I.
</think>

The reduced personal risk in corporate organization is primarily due to the limited liability feature, which protects investors from losing more than their initial investment. This protection encourages investors to undertake the risks necessary for large-scale production, leading to greater efficiency. Among the options provided, option I correctly identifies this relationship, explaining that limited liability induces investors to take on the risks needed for efficient, large-scale operations.

Answer: I
