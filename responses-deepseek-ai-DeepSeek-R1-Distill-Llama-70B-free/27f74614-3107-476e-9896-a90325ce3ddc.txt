Okay, so I have this problem about a security's price, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The security has a maturity value of $100,000. The coupon rate is 4%, and the yield required is 8%. It's due in 5 years. I need to find out what a buyer would pay for this security now.

Hmm, I remember that when you buy a bond or a security like this, you receive periodic interest payments (the coupons) and get the face value back at maturity. The price you pay now depends on the present value of all those future cash flows.

So the security is like a bond. The face value is $100,000, which is what you get at the end. The coupon rate is 4%, so each year, you get 4% of the face value as interest. That would be $4,000 each year because 4% of 100,000 is 4,000.

But the required yield is 8%. I think the yield is the discount rate used to calculate the present value of those future payments. So I need to calculate the present value of each annual coupon payment and the present value of the maturity value, then sum them all up.

Wait, but how do I calculate the present value? Oh right, the present value formula is PV = FV / (1 + r)^n, where FV is the future value, r is the discount rate, and n is the number of periods.

Since this is an annual coupon, each payment is an ordinary annuity. Alternatively, since the payment is fixed each period, it's an annuity. So I can use the present value of an ordinary annuity formula.

The formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity is: PV = PMT * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n) / r]

And the present value of the maturity value (which is a single sum) would be PV = FV / (1 + r)^n.

So the total price the buyer pays is the sum of the two present values.

Let me plug in the numbers.

First, calculate the present value of the coupons:

PMT is $4,000 each year. r is 8%, or 0.08. n is 5 years.

PV_coupons = 4000 * [(1 - (1 + 0.08)^-5) / 0.08]

Let me compute that. Let's calculate the denominator first. (1 + 0.08)^5 is 1.08^5. I remember that 1.08^5 is approximately 1.469328. So 1 divided by that is about 0.6802 (since 1/1.469328 ≈ 0.6802).

Wait, no, wait. The formula is (1 - (1/(1.08)^5)) / 0.08. So 1 - (1/1.469328) is 1 - 0.6802 = 0.3198. Then divide by 0.08, which gives 0.3198 / 0.08 = 3.9975. So approximately 4.0.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right. Because 4000 * 3.9975 is about 15,990, but that doesn't make sense in this context. Because with higher discount rates, the present value should be lower.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate (1 + 0.08)^5.

Let me compute 1.08^1 = 1.08
1.08^2 = 1.1664
1.08^3 = 1.259712
1.08^4 = 1.36048896
1.08^5 = 1.4693280768

So (1.08)^-5 is 1 / 1.469328 ≈ 0.6802.

So 1 - 0.6802 = 0.3198.

Divide by 0.08: 0.3198 / 0.08 = 3.9975, which is approximately 4.

So PV_coupons = 4000 * 3.9975 ≈ $15,990.

Now, the present value of the maturity value:

FV is $100,000. So PV_maturity = 100000 / (1.08)^5.

We already know (1.08)^5 is about 1.469328, so 100000 / 1.469328 ≈ $68,063.28.

So the total present value is the sum of PV_coupons and PV_maturity.

15,990 + 68,063.28 ≈ 84,053.28.

Looking at the options, option C is $84,028.82, which is close. So that's probably the correct answer.

Wait, but why the slight difference? Maybe I approximated too much in my calculations. Let me try to compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact formula without approximating.

Let me compute (1.08)^-5 exactly:

(1.08)^5 = 1.4693280768, so (1.08)^-5 = 0.680201735.

So 1 - 0.680201735 = 0.319798265.

Divide by 0.08: 0.319798265 / 0.08 = 3.997275826.

Multiply by 4000: 3.997275826 * 4000 = 15,989.1033.

So PV_coupons is $15,989.10.

PV_maturity is 100,000 / 1.4693280768 = 68,053.285.

Adding them together: 15,989.10 + 68,053.285 = 84,042.385.

Hmm, but the option C is $84,028.82. So there's a discrepancy of about $13. Which probably comes from using more precise numbers or perhaps I made an error elsewhere.

Wait, maybe I should calculate it step by step with more precision.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the present value interest factor of an ordinary annuity (PVIFA) for 8% over 5 years.

Looking up PVIFA(8%,5):

PVIFA = [1 - (1 + 0.08)^-5] / 0.08.

Calculating it exactly:

(1.08)^-5 = 0.68020173...

So 1 - 0.68020173 = 0.31979827.

Divide by 0.08: 0.31979827 / 0.08 = 3.9972758.

So 3.9972758 * 4000 = 15,989.10.

And PV of the face value:

100,000 / (1.08)^5 = 100,000 / 1.4693280768 = 68,053.29.

Adding them gives 84,042.39.

Wait, but the option C is $84,028.82. So why are we getting a slightly different number?

Oh, perhaps because I'm using approximated values. Let me try to compute 100,000 / 1.4693280768 more accurately.

1.4693280768 is exactly (1.08)^5.

So 100,000 divided by 1.4693280768 equals:

Let me compute 100,000 ÷ 1.4693280768.

Well, 1.4693280768 * 68,000 = approximately 68,000 * 1.4693280768.

Wait, perhaps I should just calculate 100000 / 1.4693280768.

Let me do this division more accurately.

1.4693280768 * 68,000 = ?

Wait, 1.4693280768 * 68,000.

Let me compute 1.4693280768 * 68,000:

1.4693280768 * 68,000 = 1.4693280768 * 6.8e4.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me compute 100,000 ÷ 1.4693280768.

Using a calculator, 100000 ÷ 1.4693280768 = approximately 68,053.19.

So PV_maturity is 68,053.19.

Adding to PV_coupons (15,989.10) gives 68,053.19 + 15,989.10 = 84,042.29.

Hmm, but option C is 84,028.82. So there's a difference. Maybe I made a mistake in the coupon calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the present value of each coupon payment individually to see if that makes a difference.

Each coupon is $4,000 per year for 5 years, discounted at 8%.

So:

Year 1: 4000 / 1.08 = 4000 / 1.08 ≈ 3703.70

Year 2: 4000 / (1.08)^2 ≈ 4000 / 1.1664 ≈ 3429.49

Year 3: 4000 / (1.08)^3 ≈ 4000 / 1.259712 ≈ 3172.69

Year4: 4000 / (1.08)^4 ≈ 4000 / 1.36048896 ≈ 2940.00

Year5: 4000 / (1.08)^5 ≈ 4000 / 1.469328 ≈ 2724.84

Adding these up: 3703.70 + 3429.49 = 7133.19

+3172.69 = 10305.88

+2940 = 13245.88

+2724.84 = 15,970.72.

Wait, so the total PV of coupons is 15,970.72. Then the PV of the face value is 68,053.19. So total is 68,053.19 + 15,970.72 = 84,023.91.

Hmm, that's closer to option C's 84,028.82. But still a small difference. Maybe I should carry more decimal places.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is better. Let me use the exact PVIFA.

PVIFA for 8%, 5 years is [1 - 1/(1.08)^5]/0.08.

Which is [1 - 0.68020173]/0.08 = 0.31979827 / 0.08 = 3.9972758.

So 3.9972758 * 4000 = 15,989.1032.

Adding to the 68,053.285 (as calculated earlier) gives 84,042.388.

Wait, but in my individual calculation, I get 84,023.91. There's a discrepancy. Maybe because I rounded each year's value too much.

Perhaps the correct way is to use the annuity formula for the coupons and the present value formula for the face value.

So, the exact calculation would be:

PV = (4000 * [1 - (1.08)^-5]/0.08) + (100000 / (1.08)^5 )

So plugging in the numbers:

PV_coupons = 4000 * (1 - 0.680201735)/0.08 = 4000 * 0.319798265 /0.08 = 4000 * 3.9972758 ≈ 15,989.10.

PV_face = 100,000 / 1.4693280768 ≈ 68,053.285.

Total PV = 15,989.10 + 68,053.285 ≈ 84,042.385.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C: 84,028.82.

Wait, but why the discrepancy? Maybe the options use a more precise calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate it using the formula for the price of a bond, which is:

Price = (C * (1 - (1 + r)^-n) / r ) + (F / (1 + r)^n )

Where C is the coupon payment, r is the yield, F is the face value, and n is the number of periods.

Plugging the numbers:

C = 100,000 * 0.04 = 4,000.

r = 0.08.

n=5.

So,

Price = (4000*(1 - 1.08^-5)/0.08) + (100000 * 1.08^-5 )

Compute each part:

1.08^-5 = 0.68020173.

So:

First part: 4000 * (1 - 0.68020173) / 0.08 = 4000 * 0.31979827 / 0.08.

0.31979827 / 0.08 = 3.9972758.

Multiply by 4000: 4000 *3.9972758=15,989.1032.

Second part: 100000 * 0.68020173 = 68,020.173.

Wait, no. Wait: F is 100,000, and it's F/(1.08)^5, which is 100000 * (1.08)^-5.

Which is 100000 * 0.68020173 = 68,020.173.

So total price is 15,989.1032 + 68,020.173 ≈ 84,009.276.

Hmm, that's about 84,009.28, but option C is 84,028.82. Now I'm a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, no, the second part is 100,000/(1.08)^5 = 100,000 * (1.08)^-5.

Which is 100,000 * 0.68020173 = 68,020.173.

So that's correct.

So total is 15,989.1032 +68,020.173 = 84,009.276.

But the option C is 84,028.82. Now there's a difference of about $19.

Hmm, maybe I should compute (1.08)^-5 with more precision.

Wait, perhaps the exact value of (1.08)^5 is 1.4693280768.

So (1.08)^-5 is exactly 1/1.4693280768.

Let me compute 1 divided by 1.4693280768.

1.4693280768 * 0.68 = approx 1. So 0.68 is 0.68.

Wait, but to get precise, perhaps I should use a calculator.

But without a calculator, maybe it's better to accept that perhaps the correct value is approximately 84,028.82, which is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to use semi-annual payments, but the problem states it's an annual coupon, so that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check the bond pricing formula again.

Ah, wait, the coupon rate is 4%, so the annual payment is 4% of 100,000, which is 4000. That's correct.

The yield is 8%, which is the discount rate. So yes, that's correct.

Hmm, maybe the options have rounded differently. Let me see what the exact value is.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the TVM formula.

Using the formula:

PV = PMT * [1 - (1 + r)^-n ] / r + FV / (1 + r)^n

Plugging in:

PMT = 4000, r=0.08, n=5, FV=100000.

So:

PV = 4000 * [1 - (1.08)^-5 ] / 0.08 + 100000/(1.08)^5

As calculated earlier, [1 - (1.08)^-5 ] /0.08 = 3.9972758.

So 4000 *3.9972758 = 15,989.1032.

100000/(1.08)^5 = 68,020.172.

So total is 15,989.1032 + 68,020.172 = 84,009.2752.

Wait, so that's approximately 84,009.28, which isn't exactly matching any of the options. The closest is option C: 84,028.82.

But perhaps I'm missing something here. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A: 100,000

B:75,000

C:84,028.82

D:95,000

E:87,000

F:90,000

G:78,500

H:80,000

I:70,000

J:92,500

So option C is 84,028.82, which is about 19 dollars higher than my calculation. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the present value of the coupons. Let me check that part again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the formula I'm using is wrong. No, I don't think so. The formula is correct for an ordinary annuity.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the security is a zero-coupon bond, but no, because it has a coupon rate of 4%, so it's not zero-coupon.

Alternatively, perhaps the yield is 8% semi-annual, but the problem says the yield is required to be 8%, and it doesn't specify compounding. But the coupon is annual, so perhaps the yield is also annual.

Wait, perhaps I should check using the exact formula with more precise numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C, and my calculation is slightly off due to rounding.

Alternatively, maybe the question expects me to use the approximate value without precise calculation.

In any case, the closest option to my calculation is option C: 84,028.82.
</think>

To determine the price a buyer would pay for the security, we need to calculate the present value of all future cash flows, which includes the annual coupon payments and the maturity value. The security has a face value of $100,000, a coupon rate of 4%, and a required yield of 8%. The maturity is 5 years.

### Key Steps:
1. **Annual Coupon Payment**:  
   The coupon payment is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{PMT} = \text{Face Value} \times \text{Coupon Rate} = 100,000 \times 0.04 = 4,000
   \]

2. **Present Value of Coupon Payments**:  
   The coupons form an ordinary annuity. The present value of an ordinary annuity is calculated using the formula:  
   \[
   \text{PV}_{\text{coupons}} = \text{PMT} \times \left[\frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}{r}\right]
   \]  
   Where:
