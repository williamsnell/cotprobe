Okay, so I have this question about finding the gradient of a specific objective function. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my optimization class.

The function given is the sum of two terms. The first term is (1/2) times the squared L2 norm of (Xw - y), and the second term is (1/2) times lambda times the squared L2 norm of w. Wait, actually looking at the question, the first term is (1/2)||Xw - y||² and the second is (1/2)gamma||w||². Oh, but the question is actually about a similar function with lambda instead of gamma. Wait, no, the objective function in the question is with gamma, but the expression we need the gradient for is with lambda? Or wait, no, the question says: What is the gradient of (1/2)||Xw - y||² + (1/2)lambda||w||². Oh, right, so the gamma in the initial statement might be a typo or irrelevant here. So focusing on the function f(w) = (1/2)||Xw - y||² + (1/2)λ||w||².

I remember that to find the gradient, I need to compute the derivative of f with respect to each element of w. Let's break this down into the two parts.

First term: (1/2)||Xw - y||². I think the derivative of this term with respect to w is X^T (Xw - y). Because the gradient of (1/2)||a||² is a, so here a is (Xw - y), and since we're differentiating with respect to w, it's X^T times that vector.

Wait, let me think again. For f(w) = (1/2)(Xw - y)^T (Xw - y), expanding this, the derivative df/dw is (X^T X w - X^T y). Oh wait, no, because when you take the derivative of (Xw - y)^T (Xw - y), you get 2X^T (Xw - y). But since there's a 1/2 factor, it cancels out, leaving X^T (Xw - y).

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute it step by step.

Let’s compute the derivative of the first term: (1/2)(Xw - y)^T (Xw - y). Let’s let u = Xw - y. Then, f1 = (1/2)u^T u. The derivative of f1 with respect to w is derivative of (1/2)u^T u with respect to u times derivative of u with respect to w.

The derivative of (1/2)u^T u with respect to u is u. And u = Xw - y, so derivative of u with respect to w is X. So df1/dw = u^T X^T? Wait, no, because the chain rule in vector calculus can be a bit tricky. Wait, when you have a function f(u) and u is a function of w, the derivative is (df/du) * (du/dw). But in vector terms, I think it's arranged as (du/dw)^T (df/du). Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of scalar derivatives.

Alternatively, another approach: expand f1 as (1/2)(w^T X^T X w - 2 y^T X w + y^T y). Taking the derivative term by term.

The derivative of (1/2)w^T X^T X w is (1/2)(2 X^T X w) ) = X^T X w.

The derivative of (-2 y^T X w) term is -2 X^T y.

Wait, wait. Let me compute each term:

f1 = (1/2)(Xw - y)^T (Xw - y) = (1/2)(w^T X^T X w - 2 y^T X w + y^T y).

Taking the derivative with respect to w:

d(f1)/dw = (1/2)[ 2 X^T X w  - 2 X^T y ].

The 1/2 cancels with the 2, giving X^T X w - X^T y.

So the gradient of the first term is X^T (Xw - y), which is X^T X w - X^T y.

Now the second term is (1/2)lambda ||w||². Let's compute its gradient.

This is (1/2)lambda w^T w. The derivative with respect to w is (1/2)lambda * 2 w = lambda w.

So putting it all together, the gradient of f(w) is the sum of the gradients of each term.

So gradient f = (X^T X w - X^T y) + lambda w.

Wait, but wait, the second term's gradient is lambda w, right? Because (1/2)lambda ||w||² derivative is lambda w.

So combining the two, gradient f(w) = X^T X w - X^T y + lambda w.

Wait, let me check the options. Option A is X^T X w - X^T y + lambda w. So that's option A.

Alternatively, let me look at the options:

Option A: X^T X w - X^T y + lambda w.

Option F: X^T X w - X^T y - lambda w.

Wait, so in our case, the second term is +lambda w. So the correct option would be A.

Wait, but another thought: when we have a term like (1/2) gamma ||w||^2, the gradient is gamma w, because (1/2) gamma * 2 w = gamma w.

In the given problem, the second term is (1/2) lambda ||w||^2, so the gradient is lambda w.

So the total gradient is X^T (Xw - y) + lambda w, which is X^T X w - X^T y + lambda w. So option A.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is exactly that. So the correct answer should be A.

To find the gradient of the function \( f(w) = \frac{1}{2} \norm{Xw - y}^2_2 + \frac{1}{2}\lambda \norm{w}^2_2 \), we compute the derivatives of each term separately and then combine them.

1. **First term**: \( \frac{1}{2} \norm{Xw - y}^2_2 \)  
   Let \( u = Xw - y \). Then, \( f_1 = \frac{1}{2} u^T u \).  
   - The derivative of \( \frac{1}{2} u^T u \) with respect to \( u \) is \( u \).  
   - The derivative of \( u = Xw - y \) with respect to \( w \) is \( X \).  
   - Using the chain rule, the gradient of the first term is \( X^T (Xw - y) \), which simplifies to \( X^T X w - X^T y \).

2. **Second term**: \( \frac{1}{2} \lambda \norm{w}^2_2 \)  
   - The derivative of \( \frac{1}{2} \lambda w^T w \) with respect to \( w \) is \( \lambda w \).

Combining the gradients of both terms, the total gradient is:  
\[
\nabla_w f(w) = X^T X w - X^T y + \lambda w
\]

Now, comparing this result with the given options:  
- **Option A**: \( \nabla_w f(w) = X^\top X w - X^\top y + \lambda w \)  
  This matches the derived gradient exactly.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**A**
