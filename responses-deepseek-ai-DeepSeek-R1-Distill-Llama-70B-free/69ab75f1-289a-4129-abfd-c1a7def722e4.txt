Question:

On May 19, a telephone operator for the local telephone company received a call in which a male voice said: "I want to report that the downtown sporting arena is going to be blown up tonight. " The caller then hung up. The line on which the call was made was a line owned by a woman. Immediately after receiving the call, the telephone operator reported the threatening conversation to the police. About half an hour later, during which time she had handled a number of other calls, the telephone operator received a call from a police officer who was at the woman's home. He asked her to listen to a voice. After she did, the officer asked the telephone operator if she could identify it. The telephone operator responded that she was positive that it was the voice of the person who had made the threat. As a result of the telephone operator's identification, the woman's boyfriend was arrested and charged with the crime of terrorist threatening. As a consequence of the arrest, the boyfriend lost his job and suffered embarrassment and ridicule in the community. At trial, however, the telephone operator's identification proved to be erroneous, and the boyfriend was exonerated. In a defamation action for slander by the boyfriend against the telephone operator and the telephone company, he will most likely

Options:

A: not succeed, because the telephone operator's erroneous identification was protected by a qualified privilege for statements made in the public interest.

C: not succeed, because the telephone operator's erroneous identification was a simple mistake.
D: succeed, because the telephone operator's erroneous identification resulted in financial harm.
E: succeed, because the telephone operator's erroneous identification constituted slander per Se.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this defamation question. Let me read through it again carefully.

So, the scenario: A telephone operator receives a threatening call about blowing up a downtown arena. The caller is a male voice. The operator reports this to the police. Then, about half an hour later, she gets a call from a police officer at the home of the woman who owns the line the call was made on. The officer asks her to listen to a voice, and she identifies it as the same person who made the threat. Based on this, the woman's boyfriend is arrested, charged with terrorist threatening. He loses his job and suffers embarrassment. But at trial, the operatorâ€™s identification was wrong, and the boyfriend is exonerated. Now, he's suing for slander against the operator and the telephone company.

I need to determine whether he will succeed in his defamation claim. The options are A through I.

First, let's recall defamation basics. Defamation is a false statement that harms someone's reputation, communicated to a third party. There are two types: slander (spoken) and libel (written). Here, the telephone operator made a spoken statement, so it's slander.

In this case, the operator told the police that the voice was the same as the threatening caller. The police then acted on that, leading to the arrest. The statement was made in the context of a police investigation, so it's probably a statement made to the authorities.

For slander, the plaintiff must prove that the statement was false, defamatory, published to a third party, and caused injury. But there are defenses. One key defense is "qualified privilege." A qualified privilege applies when a statement is made in a situation where the person has a legitimate interest or duty, and the communication is in pursuit of that interest. It protects statements made without malice, even if they're false, as long as they're not made with reckless disregard for the truth.

So, the telephone operator was reporting a criminal threat to the police. That seems like a situation where she has a duty to report. The police needed to investigate, so her statement to them would likely be covered by a qualified privilege. Unless she acted with actual malice, meaning she knew the statement was false or acted with reckless disregard for its truth, the privilege would protect her.

In this case, the operator didn't know the boyfriend; she just identified the voice based on her memory. She thought it was the same voice, but she was wrong. There's no indication she lied intentionally or recklessly. So, she probably didn't have actual malice.

Also, the telephone company: as her employer, they might be vicariously liable if she was acting within the scope of her employment. But if her statement is privileged, then the company would also be protected.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Not succeed because the statement was protected by qualified privilege for statements made in public interest. That makes sense because reporting a crime is in the public interest, so qualified privilege applies.

Option B: Not succeed because without actual malice. But I think it's more about the qualified privilege, which would be the primary reason. Plus, actual malice is a higher standard, and the absence of it would mean the privilege wasn't abused.

Option C: Not succeed because it was a simple mistake. But simple mistakes can still lead to liability if they're negligent, but in this case, the qualified privilege would cover it.

Option D: Succeed because financial harm. But even if there's harm, if the statement is privileged, the claim fails.

Option E: Succeed because slander per se. Slander per se involves certain categories like crime, loathsome disease, etc. Accusing someone of a crime is slander per se. But if the statement is privileged, that defense would apply regardless of whether it's per se or not.

Option F: Succeed because loss of reputation. Again, without overcoming the privilege, this wouldn't matter.

Option G: Succeed because reckless disregard. But if she wasn't reckless, just mistaken, this doesn't apply. There's no indication she was reckless.

Option H: Succeed because public humiliation. Same as F and D, the harm is there but the privilege would prevent liability.

Option I: Not succeed because made in course of employment. That's more about whether the employer is liable. The employer would be liable if the employee was, but the employee might be protected by privilege, so the employer would also be protected.

So, the best answer is probably A. The telephone operator's statement was made in the public interest, covered by qualified privilege. Unless she acted with malice, which she didn't, the privilege applies, and the defamation claim fails.

Another point: the operator immediately reported the threat, which shows she was acting responsibly. When she identified the voice later, she was cooperating with the police investigation. These are situations where qualified privilege would definitely apply.

So in the options, A says the operator's erroneous identification was protected by qualified privilege for statements in the public interest. That fits.

The question revolves around a defamation claim for slander brought by the boyfriend against the telephone operator and the telephone company. The key issue is whether the telephone operator's erroneous identification of the boyfriend's voice, which led to his arrest and subsequent exoneration, constitutes slander.

To succeed in a slander claim, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant made a false, defamatory statement that was published to a third party and caused harm. However, certain defenses, such as qualified privilege, can protect the defendant from liability. Qualified privilege applies when a statement is made in a situation where the speaker has a legitimate interest or duty, and the communication is in pursuit of that interest. It protects statements made without malice, even if they are false, as long as they are not made with reckless disregard for the truth.

In this case, the telephone operator reported a threatening call to the police, which is a legitimate and responsible action in the public interest. Her subsequent voice identification to the police was made in good faith, without any indication of actual malice or reckless disregard for the truth. Therefore, her statements are protected by qualified privilege. Since the boyfriend cannot overcome this privilege, his defamation claim is unlikely to succeed.

Option A correctly identifies that the telephone operator's erroneous identification was protected by a qualified privilege for statements made in the public interest. This is the most accurate reason why the defamation claim will not succeed.
