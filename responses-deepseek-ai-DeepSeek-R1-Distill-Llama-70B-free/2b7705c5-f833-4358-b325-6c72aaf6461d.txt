Okay, so I've got this investment question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. The investment pays out $10 per annum forever, and I need to find its worth with a market discount rate of 5%. Hmm, sounds like a present value problem.

Wait, I remember something about perpetuities from my finance class. Right, a perpetuity is a stream of equal cash flows that go on indefinitely. The formula for the present value of a perpetuity is PV = C / r, where C is the annual cash flow and r is the discount rate.

So in this case, C is $10 each year, and the discount rate r is 5%, which is 0.05 in decimal. Plugging those numbers into the formula, PV = 10 / 0.05. Let me calculate that. 10 divided by 0.05 is 200. So the present value should be $200.

Looking at the options, J is $200. So I think the answer is J.

Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't mix up any formulas. Oh right, another way to think about it is that the present value is the annual payment divided by the discount rate. Yep, 10 divided by 0.05 is indeed 200. So I'm confident that J is the correct answer.

The present value of a perpetuity is calculated using the formula:

\[ PV = \frac{C}{r} \]

Where:
- \( C = \$10 \) (annual cash flow)
- \( r = 5\% = 0.05 \) (discount rate)

Plugging in the values:

\[ PV = \frac{10}{0.05} = 200 \]

Thus, the investment is worth **$200**. The correct answer is **J**.
