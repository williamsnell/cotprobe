Okay, so I've got this problem here about electrons being ejected from chlorine atoms when high-energy photons hit them. The question is asking which subshell's electrons would have the highest velocity after ejection. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

Alright, I remember that when electrons are ejected from atoms, it's called the photoelectric effect. The energy of the incoming photon has to be enough to overcome the binding energy of the electron in the atom. Oh wait, but the photon's energy also relates to the kinetic energy of the ejected electron. So the higher the energy of the photon, the more kinetic energy the electron has, right?

Wait, but wait. The problem says the photons are high-energy, so I guess they can eject electrons from any subshell. But we're looking for which electrons would have the highest velocity after being ejected. Velocity is related to kinetic energy—higher kinetic energy means higher velocity.

I think the key here is understanding the binding energies of the different subshells. Electrons in different subshells have different binding energies. The higher the binding energy, the more energy is needed to eject them. But when they are ejected, their kinetic energy is the photon's energy minus the binding energy. Oh wait, but if the photon energy is the same for all electrons, then the one with the lowest binding energy would have the highest kinetic energy. Because KE = photon energy - binding energy. So lower binding energy leaves more KE.

Wait, but in this case, the problem says the photons are high-energy. So perhaps they are providing more than enough energy to eject electrons from any subshell. So the photon energy is much higher than the binding energies of all the subshells. So then, the KE would be the same for all? No, that doesn't make sense. Because the binding energy varies, so the KE would vary too.

Wait, no. For each electron, the photon's energy is E. Each electron has a binding energy E0. So the kinetic energy is E - E0. If E is the same for all (same photons), then the electron with the lowest E0 would have the highest KE. Because subtracting a smaller number leaves a larger result.

So, which subshell has the lowest binding energy? I think binding energy increases with higher nuclear charge and also depends on the shell and subshell. Electrons in the same principal quantum number (n) have different energies based on their subshell. For example, in the same n, s electrons are lower in energy than p, which are lower than d, etc. Or wait, no, I think the energy levels are such that for a given n, the s subshell is lower in energy than p, which is lower than d, and so on. So s is more tightly bound, higher binding energy.

Wait, no. Wait, the energy levels go in the order of increasing energy: 1s < 2s < 2p < 3s < 3p < 4s < 3d < 4p < 5s < 4d < 5p, etc. Wait, that can't be right. I remember that the 4s fills before 3d, so 4s is lower in energy than 3d. So in general, the order is based on n + l, where lower n + l means lower energy. So for a given n, higher l (like d is higher than p, which is higher than s) would have higher energy. But wait, no, within the same n, s has lower energy than p, which is lower than d, etc. So for example, 2s is lower than 2p, which is lower than 2d? Wait, no, 2d doesn't exist. Oh right, for a given n, l can be from 0 to n-1. So n=2 can have l=0 (s) and l=1 (p). No d in n=2.

So in terms of binding energy, lower energy levels (more tightly bound) have higher binding energy. So if a subshell is higher in energy, its electrons are less tightly bound, so lower binding energy. So when a photon ejects an electron, the one with lower binding energy will have higher KE.

So the question is, which of the given subshells has the lowest binding energy? Because that would mean their electrons have the highest KE after ejection.

Looking at the options, the subshells are:

A: 1s
B:5p
C:4d
D:2s
E:2p
F:4s
G:5s
H:4p
I:3d
J:3p

So the order of these subshells in terms of energy (from low to high, meaning binding energy from high to low) would be:

1s (lowest energy, highest binding) → 2s → 2p → 3p → 3d →4s →4p →5s →4d →5p (highest energy, lowest binding).

Wait, does that make sense? Let me think again. The general filling order is:

1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, 4d, 5p.

So the energy increases in the order I just listed. So the higher the position in this sequence, the higher the energy of the subshell. So 5p is the highest, then 4d, then 5s, etc.

Wait, no. Because 4d comes after 5s. So 5s is lower in energy than 4d. So 5s electrons are more tightly bound than 4d.

So the order from lowest (most tightly bound, highest binding energy) to highest (least tightly bound, lowest binding energy) would be:

1s < 2s < 2p < 3s < 3p < 4s < 5s < 4p < 3d < 5p < 4d.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because the 3d is higher than 4s. So in terms of energy levels, 4s is lower than 3d. So 3d is higher in energy than 4s. So in the order, 4s comes before 3d.

So putting it all together, the subshells in order from lowest to highest energy:

1s (lowest) → 2s → 2p →3s →3p →4s →5s →3d →4p →5p →4d (highest? Or wait, 4d is higher than 5p? Or is 5p higher than 4d?)

Wait, the filling order for the subshells is as follows, based on the Madelung rule (n + l, then n):

So for each subshell, the sum n + l determines the order. Lower sum comes first. If sums are equal, the one with lower n comes first.

So let's compute n + l for each:

1s: n=1, l=0 → 1+0=1

2s: 2+0=2

2p:2+1=3

3p:3+1=4

4s:4+0=4 (same as 3p, but n is higher, so 4s comes after 3p)

Wait wait, no, Madelung says lower sum comes first. So 2p (3) comes after 2s (2). 3p (4) comes after 2p (3). 4s has sum 4, same as 3p. So 3p comes before 4s because when sums are equal, lower n comes first. So 3p (n=3) comes before 4s (n=4).

Then 3d: 3+2=5.

4p:4+1=5. So 3d (n=3) comes before 4p (n=4) because same sum, lower n first.

5s:5+0=5. So same sum as 4p, which is 5. So 4p (n=4) comes before 5s (n=5).

Wait, no. Because 4p comes after 5s? No, because 5s is filled before 4p. So the order is 5s comes before 4p.

Wait, maybe I should list all the subshells in order of increasing energy:

1s (1)

2s (2), 2p (3)

3s (3), 3p (4), 4s (4)

3d (5), 4p (5), 5s (5)

4d (6), 5p (6), etc.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the order as:

1s → 2s → 2p → 3s → 3p → 4s → 3d →4p →5s →4d →5p →...

So from lowest to highest energy.

So in this order, 1s is lowest, then 2s, then 2p, then 3s, 3p, 4s, then 3d, then 4p, 5s, 4d, 5p, etc.

Wait, that still doesn't clarify 5s vs 4p. But I think 5s comes after 4p in the filling order because 5s is filled before 4p. Wait, no. Actually, 4p comes after 5s in the filling order. Because 5s fills before 4p. Let me think. The periodic table: 4s fills before 3d, 5s before 4d, 6s before 4f, etc. So for 5s, its energy is lower than 4p. So electrons in 5s are more tightly bound (higher binding energy) than those in 4p.

So putting it all together, the subshells from lowest to highest energy (so binding energy from highest to lowest) are:

1s < 2s < 2p < 3s < 3p < 4s < 5s < 3d < 4p < 5p < 4d.

Wait, no. Because 4d is higher than 5p? Or is 5p higher than 4d?

Wait, for transition metals, electrons fill 4d after 5s. So 5s is lower in energy than 4d. But about 5p vs 4d?

Hmm, I think the order is that 4d is higher than 5p. Because after 5s comes 4d, then 5p.

Wait, let me look up the order. Alternatively, remember that the 5p subshell is filled after 4d. So 4d comes before 5p, meaning 4d is lower in energy than 5p. So electrons in 4d are more tightly bound than those in 5p. So binding energy of 4d is higher than 5p.

Wait, no. Because 5p is a higher principal quantum number. But sometimes, d subshells can be higher than s and p of higher n. For example, 3d is higher than 4s. Similarly, 4d is higher than 5s. Then 5p would be higher than 4d. Because 5p is in n=5, l=1; 4d is n=4, l=2.

So for n + l: 5p is 5+1=6, 4d is 4+2=6. So same sum. Then the one with lower n comes first. So 4d (n=4) comes before 5p (n=5). So 4d is lower in energy than 5p. So 5p has higher energy than 4d.

Wait, that's confusing because I thought 5p was higher. But according to the Madelung rule, same sum, lower n comes first. So 4d would be filled before 5p. So 4d is lower in energy than 5p.

So in terms of energy, from lowest to highest:

1s < 2s < 2p < 3s < 3p < 4s < 5s < 3d < 4p < 4d < 5p.

Wait, no. Wait, 3d has sum 5, 4p has sum 5. So 3d comes before 4p because lower n. So 3d is lower than 4p. Then 4p is followed by 5s (sum 5) but wait, 5s has sum 5 (n=5, l=0). So 4p (n=4) comes before 5s because same sum, lower n. So 4p comes before 5s, which is lower than 4d?

Wait, no. I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to make a list:

Order of filling (from lowest to highest energy):

1s (1)
2s (2), 2p (3)
3s (3), 3p (4), 4s (4)
3d (5), 4p (5), 5s (5)
4d (6), 5p (6), etc.

So within the same n + l, lower n comes first.

So in the same group of n + l = 5, we have 3d (n=3), 4p (n=4), 5s (n=5). So 3d comes before 4p, which comes before 5s.

Wait, but 5s is filled before 4p in reality. So the filling order is 5s before 4p. So that would mean 5s is lower in energy than 4p. So the order should be 5s comes before 4p.

Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the order. Let me think again. The actual filling order for the subshells is:

1s

2s 2p

3s 3p 4s

3d 4p 5s

4d 5p 6s

and so on.

Wait, no. The filling order after 4s is 3d, then 4p, then 5s, then 4d, then 5p. So 5s comes after 4p.

So the actual energy levels from low to high:

1s < 2s < 2p < 3s < 3p < 4s < 3d < 4p < 5s < 4d < 5p.

Wait, that can't be right because 3d is higher than 4s. So 4s is lower than 3d.

So putting it all together, the correct order is:

1s → 2s → 2p → 3s → 3p → 4s → 3d → 4p → 5s → 4d → 5p.

So the subshells in the question are:

A:1s → very low energy, high binding
B:5p → high energy, low binding
C:4d → higher than 5s, lower than 5p
D:2s → lower than 2p
E:2p → higher than 2s
F:4s → lower than 3d, etc.
G:5s → higher than 4p, lower than 4d
H:4p → higher than 3d, lower than 5s
I:3d → higher than 4s, lower than 4p
J:3p → lower than 4s, higher than 3s.

So looking at the options, the subshell with the highest energy (lowest binding) is 5p (option B) and 4d (option C). Wait, what's the order between 5p and 4d? Based on the order I wrote earlier, 4d comes before 5p, so 4d is lower in energy than 5p. So 5p is the highest in energy among the options given.

So the electrons in 5p subshell would have the lowest binding energy. So when a photon ejects them, the KE would be E_photon - E_binding. Since E_photon is same for all, the electron from 5p would have the highest KE, hence highest velocity.

Wait, but the options are B and C. Oh, 5p is option B, 4d is option C. So if 5p is higher in energy than 4d, then 5p electrons have lower binding energy. So they have higher KE after ejection.

So the correct answer is B:5p.

Wait, but what about 4d? Oh, because in the filling order, 4d comes before 5p. So 5p is higher in energy than 4d, meaning 5p electrons have lower binding energy. So option B is the correct choice.
</think>

To determine which subshell's electrons would have the highest velocity after being ejected by high-energy photons, we need to consider the relationship between binding energy, photon energy, and kinetic energy. The kinetic energy (KE) of an ejected electron is given by:

\[
KE = E_{\text{photon}} - E_{\text{binding}}
\]

Here, the photon energy (\(E_{\text{photon}}\)) is the same for all electrons. Therefore, the electron with the lowest binding energy (\(E_{\text{binding}}\)) will have the highest kinetic energy, and consequently, the highest velocity.

The binding energy of an electron depends on the subshell it occupies. Within an atom, subshells are filled in order of increasing energy, which follows the Madelung rule: \(n + l\), where \(n\) is the principal quantum number and \(l\) is the azimuthal quantum number. For subshells with the same \(n + l\), the one with the lower \(n\) has lower energy. The general order of subshell energies is:

\[
1s < 2s < 2p < 3s < 3p < 4s < 3d < 4p < 5s < 4d < 5p
\]

From this order, the \(5p\) subshell has the highest energy (lowest binding energy) among the options provided. Electrons in the \(5p\) subshell are the least tightly bound and will therefore have the highest kinetic energy after being ejected by the photons, resulting in the highest velocity.

Thus, the electrons originally from the \(5p\) subshell will have the highest velocity after ejection.
