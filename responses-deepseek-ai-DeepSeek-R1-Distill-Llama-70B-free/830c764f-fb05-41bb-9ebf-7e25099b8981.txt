Okay, so I've got this problem here about heat transfer in a tube with oil flowing through it. Hmm, I need to find the heat transfer coefficient and the mean exit temperature of the oil. Alright, let's break it down step by step.

First, the problem gives me a bunch of data. The tube is 15 ft long with an internal diameter of 0.0303 ft. The oil flow rate is 80 lbm/hr, and the wall temperature is 350°F. The oil enters at 150°F. The properties of the oil are specific heat Cp = 0.5 Btu/lbm-°F and thermal conductivity k = 0.083 Btu/hr-ft-°F. There's also a viscosity-temperature table, which probably matters because viscosity affects the Reynolds number.

Wait, so I think I need to calculate the heat transfer coefficient using forced convection. The formula for the heat transfer coefficient in a tube is probably something like the Dittus-Boelter equation. Let me remember that. The Dittus-Boelter equation is Nu = 0.023 * Re^0.8 * Pr^0.3, where Nu is Nusselt number, Re is Reynolds number, and Pr is Prandtl number. Once I have Nu, I can find h (the heat transfer coefficient) as h = (k/d) * Nu.

But wait, before that, I need to find Re and Pr. Re is (V*d)/µ, but wait, V is velocity, which I don't have directly. Alternatively, since I have the mass flow rate, maybe I can find the velocity from that. Alternatively, another formula for Re could be (mass flow rate)/(π*d*µ/2), or wait, more accurately, Re = (m_dot) / (π * d * µ/2), but let me think again.

Wait, mass flow rate (m_dot) is 80 lbm/hr. The cross-sectional area A is π*(d^2)/4. So velocity V would be m_dot / (A * density). Oh wait, but I don't have the density of the oil. Hmm. Alternatively, since the oil's viscosity is given at various temperatures, maybe I can assume the oil's properties at the average temperature. Or perhaps I should calculate the bulk temperature since the oil is heating up as it flows through the tube.

Wait, but I don't know the exit temperature yet. That's part of the problem. So maybe I can use the mean temperature. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the bisection method or make an initial assumption.

Wait, another approach. Since the oil's viscosity varies with temperature, maybe I should take the viscosity at the average of the inlet and outlet temperatures. But since the outlet isn't known, perhaps I can guess. Alternatively, I can use the Sieder-Tate equation, which is similar to Dittus-Boelter but includes a correction for varying viscosity when the wall temperature is different from the bulk temperature. The Sieder-Tate equation is Nu = 0.027 * Re^0.8 * Pr^0.33 * (μ/μ_wall)^0.14. Oh wait, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe Dittus-Boelter is sufficient if the temperature difference isn't too extreme. But I'm not sure.

Wait, let me first figure out the steps:

1. Calculate Reynolds number (Re)
2. Use Re to find Prandtl number (Pr)
3. Use Re and Pr to find Nusselt number (Nu)
4. Use Nu to find h = (k/d) * Nu
5. Calculate the heat transfer using Q = h * A * ΔT
6. Also, calculate the exit temperature using Q = m_dot * Cp * (T_exit - T_in)

Wait, but I need to find both h and T_exit. So perhaps I can set up an equation where I can solve for T_exit.

Let me outline the variables:

Given:
- L = 15 ft (length of tube)
- d = 0.0303 ft (diameter)
- m_dot = 80 lbm/hr
- T_wall = 350°F
- T_in = 150°F
- Cp = 0.5 Btu/lbm-°F
- k = 0.083 Btu/hr-ft-°F
- Viscosity μ at various T.

I think the approach should be:

1. Assume an exit temperature, calculate the average bulk temperature, find the properties (μ, maybe others) at that temperature, compute Re, Pr, Nu, h, calculate Q, then compute the exit temp from Q = m_dot * Cp * (T_exit - T_in). Then iterate until the assumed T_exit matches the calculated one.

Alternatively, perhaps an average temperature is sufficient.

Wait, but maybe I can make a first approximation. Let's proceed step by step.

First, I need the velocity of the oil. To find Re, I need velocity, which is m_dot / (A * density). But I don't have density. Wait, another formula for Re is (4*m_dot)/(π*d*μ). Because A = π d²/4, so m_dot = density * V * A. So V = m_dot/(density * A) = m_dot/(density * π d²/4) → m_dot = density * (π d²/4) * V → V = (4 m_dot) / (density * π d²).

Wait, but Re is (density * V * d) / μ. Substituting V from above:

Re = (density * (4 m_dot/(density * π d²)) ) * d ) / μ = (4 m_dot) / (π d μ)

Oh, right, because the density cancels out. So Re = (4 * m_dot) / (π * d * μ). That's useful because I don't need density.

So Re is (4 * m_dot) / (π * d * μ). Got it.

Now, m_dot is 80 lbm/hr. But I need to check the units because μ is given in lbm/ft-hr. Let me see: 4 * m_dot (lbm/hr) divided by π * d (ft) * μ (lbm/(ft·hr)) → so units would be (lbm/hr) / (ft*(lbm/(ft·hr)) )) → (lbm/hr) / (lbm/hr) → dimensionless, which is correct for Re.

So, I can compute Re once I have μ. But μ depends on temperature. Hmm.

I think that for the initial calculation, I can take the average of inlet and exit temperatures. But since I don't know exit temp, maybe I can guess it. Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that the oil's temperature increases linearly, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I can make an initial guess, compute, and then iterate.

Wait, perhaps using the Dittus-Boelter equation, which assumes that the fluid properties are evaluated at the bulk temperature. So I can use the average of inlet and exit temperatures. But since I don't know the exit, perhaps I can start by assuming a reasonable exit temp, calculate, and see.

Alternatively, maybe I can proceed without assuming, but it's getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the exit temp using the heat transfer equation and find h based on the properties evaluated at the mean temperature.

Wait, but let's think about the energy balance. The heat transferred Q is equal to the heat gained by the oil. So:

Q = h * A * (T_wall - T_bulk_avg)
Also, Q = m_dot * Cp * (T_exit - T_in)

So combining these:

h * A * (T_wall - T_bulk_avg) = m_dot * Cp * (T_exit - T_in)

But T_bulk_avg is (T_in + T_exit)/2, assuming a linear temperature profile, which is an approximation.

So let me write that equation.

But I also need h, which depends on Re and Pr, which in turn depend on T_bulk_avg because μ is a function of T.

Hmm, this is getting a bit circular. Maybe I can set up an iterative approach.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Assume an initial T_exit, say T1.
2. Compute T_avg = (T_in + T1)/2.
3. Find μ at T_avg from the given table.
4. Compute Re = (4 * m_dot) / (π * d * μ)
5. Compute Pr = (μ * Cp) / k
6. Compute Nu = 0.023 * Re^0.8 * Pr^0.3
7. Compute h = Nu * k / d
8. Compute Q using h: Q = h * π d L (T_wall - T_avg)
9. Compute T_exit using Q = m_dot * Cp (T_exit - T_in)
10. Compare T_exit with T1. If they are close, done. Otherwise, set T1 = T_exit and repeat.

But I'm not sure what T1 should be. Let's make an initial guess. The wall is at 350°F, inlet at 150°F. Let's say the exit is 250°F as an initial guess.

So first iteration:

T_exit_guess = 250°F

T_avg = (150 + 250)/2 = 200°F

Looking at the viscosity table:

At T=200°F, μ is 12.22 lbm/(ft·hr)

Now compute Re:

Re = (4 * 80) / (π * 0.0303 * 12.22)

Calculate denominator: π * 0.0303 * 12.22 ≈ 3.1416 * 0.0303 ≈ 0.0952. 0.0952 * 12.22 ≈ 1.164.

So Re ≈ (320) / 1.164 ≈ 274.7.

Wait, wait, 4*80=320. 320 / (π * 0.0303 * 12.22) → 320 / (0.0303 * 12.22 * π) → 0.0303 *12.22 ≈ 0.370, multiplied by π (≈3.1416) → 0.370 *3.1416≈1.161. So 320 /1.161 ≈ 275.5.

So Re ≈275.5.

Pr = (μ * Cp)/k = (12.22 lbm/(ft·hr) * 0.5 Btu/lbm-°F ) / 0.083 Btu/hr-ft-°F

Compute numerator: 12.22 * 0.5 =6.11

Denominator: 0.083

So Pr =6.11 /0.083 ≈73.6.

Now Nu=0.023 * Re^0.8 * Pr^0.3

Re^0.8: 275.5^0.8: Let me calculate that. Alternatively, I can use logarithms.

But maybe approximate: 275 is roughly 10^2.44, because 10^2.44= 275? Let me see, log10(275)=2.4393. So 275^0.8=10^(2.4393 *0.8)=10^1.9514≈ 89.7.

Pr^0.3: 73.6^0.3. Hmm, 73.6 is about 10^1.866. So 10^(1.866*0.3)=10^0.5598≈3.63.

So Nu≈0.023 *89.7 *3.63 → 0.023 * 326.35 → approx 7.506.

So h= (k/d) * Nu. k=0.083, d=0.0303.

h= (0.083 /0.0303) *7.506 → (2.738) *7.506 ≈20.53 Btu/hr-ft²-°F.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

0.083 / 0.0303 → 0.083 ÷ 0.0303 ≈ 2.738.

2.738 *7.506 → 2.738 *7 =19.166, 2.738*0.506≈1.384. Sum is 20.55.

So h≈20.55.

Now compute Q = h * A * (T_wall - T_avg). A is the surface area, which is π d L.

A= π *0.0303 *15 → π *0.4554≈1.43 ft².

So Q=20.55 *1.43*(350-200)=20.55 *1.43 *150.

20 *1.43=28.6, 0.55*1.43≈0.7865. So total 28.6+0.7865≈29.386. Multiply by 150: 29.386 *150 ≈4407.9 Btu/hr.

Now compute T_exit using Q= m_dot * Cp (T_exit - T_in).

4407.9 =80 *0.5*(T_exit -150) → 4407.9 =40*(T_exit-150) → T_exit-150=4407.9/40 ≈110.2. So T_exit≈260.2°F.

Wait, but my initial guess was T_exit=250, but the calculated T_exit is 260.2. So now I'll use 260 as the new guess.

Second iteration:

T_exit_guess =260°F.

T_avg=(150+260)/2=205°F.

Looking at the viscosity table: The temperatures given are 150,200,250,300,350. 205 is between 200 and 250. So I need to interpolate.

At 200°F, μ=12.22; at 250°F, μ=9.2. So for 205°F, which is 5°F above 200, the difference is 50°F. So 5/50=0.1. So μ=12.22 - 0.1*(12.22-9.2)=12.22-0.302=11.918 lbm/(ft·hr).

Wait, alternatively, maybe a linear interpolation.

Between 200 and 250°F, μ decreases from 12.22 to9.2. So per degree, decrease is (9.2-12.22)/50= (-3.02)/50≈-0.0604 per °F.

So at 205°F: 12.22 +5*(-0.0604)=12.22 -0.302=11.918 lbm/(ft·hr).

So μ=11.918.

Now compute Re=4*80/(π*0.0303*11.918)

Denominator: π *0.0303 *11.918≈3.1416 *0.0303≈0.0952. 0.0952 *11.918≈1.137.

So Re=320/1.137≈281.3.

Pr=(μ*Cp)/k = (11.918 *0.5)/0.083 → (5.959)/0.083≈71.8.

Now compute Nu=0.023 * Re^0.8 * Pr^0.3.

Re^0.8: 281.3^0.8.

Let me calculate this. Let's take natural logs: ln(281.3)=5.645. Multiply by 0.8: 4.516. Exponentiate: e^4.516≈ 92.3.

Pr^0.3: 71.8^0.3.

ln(71.8)=4.265. 0.3*4.265≈1.2795. e^1.2795≈3.595.

So Nu=0.023 *92.3 *3.595 → 0.023 *331.5→≈7.62.

h= (0.083 /0.0303)*7.62 → 2.738 *7.62≈20.90 Btu/hr-ft²-°F.

Now compute Q= h * A * (T_wall - T_avg).

h=20.90, A=1.43 ft², T_wall=350°F, T_avg=205°F.

ΔT=350-205=145°F.

So Q=20.90 *1.43 *145.

Calculate step by step:

20.9 *1.43 → 20 *1.43=28.6, 0.9*1.43=1.287. Total≈29.887.

29.887 *145 → 29 *145 =4205, 0.887*145≈128.7 → sum≈4333.7 Btu/hr.

Now compute T_exit: Q=80 *0.5*(T_exit-150)=40*(T_exit-150)=4333.7.

So T_exit-150=4333.7/40≈108.34 → T_exit≈258.34°F.

Hmm, the new T_exit is about 258.3, which is less than the previous guess of 260.2. So the previous estimate was 260, and now it's 258.3. Let's take the average, say 259, and do another iteration.

Third iteration:

T_exit_guess=259°F.

T_avg=(150+259)/2=204.5°F.

Interpolate μ at 204.5°F.

Between 200 and 250°F, difference of 50°F. 204.5-200=4.5°F. So fraction=4.5/50=0.09.

μ=12.22 -0.09*(12.22-9.2)=12.22 -0.09*(3.02)=12.22-0.2718≈11.948 lbm/(ft·hr).

Compute Re=4*80/(π *0.0303 *11.948).

Denominator: π *0.0303 *11.948 ≈3.1416 *0.0303 ≈0.0952. 0.0952 *11.948≈1.138.

Re=320 /1.138≈280.9.

Pr=(11.948 *0.5)/0.083 →5.974 /0.083≈71.98.

Nu=0.023 * Re^0.8 * Pr^0.3.

Re=280.9 → ln(280.9)=5.64. 0.8*5.64=4.512 → e^4.512≈92.0.

Pr=71.98 → ln(71.98)=4.265 → 0.3*4.265=1.2795 → e^1.2795≈3.595.

So Nu=0.023 *92.0 *3.595≈0.023 *331.4≈7.62.

h=(0.083/0.0303
