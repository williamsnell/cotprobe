Question:

A truck and a car collided at an intersection. Both drivers were injured, and each one filed a lawsuit against the other for negligence. At trial, the jury found each of the drivers liable for negligence. The jury found that the amount of the truck driver's injuries was $10,000, and the amount of the car driver's injuries was $8,000. The jury assigned 50 percent of the fault for the accident to the truck driver and 50 percent of the fault to the car driver. Assume that the jurisdiction has a statute in effect that provides: "Contributory negligence shall not bar recovery in an action to recover damages for negligence resulting in injury to person or property if such negligence was not as great as the negligence of the person from whom recovery is sought. Any damages allowed shall be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the person who is seeking recovery. "Which of the following is the appropriate judgment in the case?

Options:

A: The truck driver recovers $4,000, and the car driver recovers $2,000.
B: The truck driver recovers $2,000, and the car driver recovers $6,000.
C: The truck driver recovers $1,000, and the car driver recovers nothing.
D: The truck driver recovers nothing, and the car driver recovers $4,000.
E: The car driver recovers $5,000, and the truck driver recovers $5,000.
F: The truck driver recovers $5,000, and the car driver recovers $4,000.
G: The truck driver recovers $6,000, and the car driver recovers $2,000.
H: Neither party recovers anything from the other.
I: The truck driver recovers $10,000, and the car driver recovers $8,000.
J: The truck driver recovers $8,000, and the car driver recovers $10,000.

Okay, so I have this question about tort law, specifically dealing with contributory negligence and how damages are apportioned. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The scenario is that a truck and a car collided. Both drivers were injured and sued each other for negligence. The jury found each driver liable, so both were negligent. The truck driver's injuries amount to $10,000, and the car driver's are $8,000. The fault is split 50-50 between them.

The jurisdiction has a statute regarding contributory negligence. I remember that contributory negligence can bar recovery, but under some statutes, if the plaintiff's negligence isn't greater than the defendant's, they can still recover, but their damages are reduced proportionally.

So the statute says: "Contributory negligence shall not bar recovery if the plaintiff's negligence was not as great as the defendant's. Damages are diminished in proportion to the plaintiff's own negligence."

Wait, so in pure contributory negligence, if the plaintiff is even 1% at fault, they recover nothing. But this statute seems to modify that. So it's a form of comparative negligence, probably.

In this case, both are 50% at fault. So each is equally to blame. So for each plaintiff, their own negligence is equal to the defendant's.

So under the statute, the truck driver (plaintiff in his case against the car driver) can recover, but his damages are diminished by his own percentage of fault. Same for the car driver.

So let's break it down.

Truck driver's claim: His injuries are $10,000. He is 50% at fault, so his recovery is diminished by 50%. So 10,000 * 0.5 = $5,000.

Car driver's claim: His injuries are $8,000. He is 50% at fault, so his recovery is 8,000 * 0.5 = $4,000.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. When each sues the other, each is a plaintiff in their own case. So the truck driver sues the car driver, claiming the car driver was 50% at fault. The car driver sues the truck driver, same.

So in the truck driver's case against the car driver: the truck driver's damages are $10k, but he is 50% at fault. So under the statute, his recovery is reduced by 50%, so he can recover $5k from the car driver.

In the car driver's case against the truck driver: his damages are $8k, but he is 50% at fault, so he can recover $4k from the truck driver.

So the truck driver would get $5k from the car driver, and the car driver would get $4k from the truck driver.

Looking at the options:

Option F says: Truck driver recovers $5k, car driver $4k. That's exactly what I calculated.

Wait, but let me double-check the options to make sure.

Option F: Truck driver recovers $5,000, and the car driver recovers $4,000. Yes.

What about the other options? Option E is each getting $5k and $5k. But the damages are different, so that doesn't make sense. Option B has truck driver getting $2k and car $6k. Hmm, not sure why that would happen. Maybe if it were based on each other's percentage, but not in this case.

Wait, wait. Another approach: each is suing the other. So in the truck driver's lawsuit, the defendant is the car driver. The truck driver's negligence is 50%, so his recovery is 10k * (1 - 0.5) = 5k.

Similarly, the car driver's lawsuit: his damages are 8k, his own fault is 50%, so he can recover 8k * 0.5 = 4k.

So the total for each: truck driver gets 5k, car driver gets 4k. So option F is correct.

But wait another thing: are they offsetting the damages? Like, do they have to pay each other? Or are their recoveries independent?

In some cases, the court might offset the judgments. For example, if the truck driver is supposed to pay the car driver $4k, and the car driver is supposed to pay the truck driver $5k, the net result would be the truck driver pays the car driver $1k (5k -4k). But I don't think that's what the question is asking. The question asks for the appropriate judgment in each case, not the net result.

So each case is separate. So the truck driver recovers $5k from the car driver, and the car driver recovers $4k from the truck driver. So the answer is F.

The scenario involves a truck and a car collision where both drivers were found 50% at fault for the accident. The truck driver's injuries amounted to $10,000, and the car driver's injuries amounted to $8,000. The jurisdiction follows a modified contributory negligence statute, which allows recovery if the plaintiff's negligence is not greater than the defendant's, but damages are reduced proportionally to the plaintiff's fault.

Under this statute:

1. **Truck Driver's Claim**: The truck driver's damages are $10,000, but since he is 50% at fault, his recovery is reduced by 50%. Thus, he recovers $5,000 from the car driver.

2. **Car Driver's Claim**: The car driver's damages are $8,000, but since he is also 50% at fault, his recovery is reduced by 50%. Thus, he recovers $4,000 from the truck driver.

The judgments are independent of each other, meaning the truck driver recovers $5,000 from the car driver, and the car driver recovers $4,000 from the truck driver. This matches **Option F**, where the truck driver recovers $5,000 and the car driver recovers $4,000.
