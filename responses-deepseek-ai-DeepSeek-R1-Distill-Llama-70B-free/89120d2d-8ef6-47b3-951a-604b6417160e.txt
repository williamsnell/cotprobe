Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about capacitance when the length of a cable is doubled. Hmm, I remember that capacitance has to do with the ability of a capacitor to store electric charge. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact relationships here.

Wait, the question is about a cable. I think a cable here probably refers to a coaxial cable or something similar, where there are two conductors. Oh right, like a coaxial cable has an inner conductor and an outer conductor, separated by some insulating material. So the capacitance of such a cable must depend on certain factors.

I recall the formula for capacitance for a coaxial cable. Let me think... Oh yeah, the capacitance C is given by (2 * π * ε₀ * εᵣ * L) / ln(b/a), where L is the length of the cable, a is the radius of the inner conductor, and b is the radius of the outer conductor. ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity and εᵣ is the relative permittivity of the dielectric material between them.

So in this formula, C is directly proportional to L. That means if the length L is doubled, the capacitance should also double, right? Because C = k * L, where k is all the other constants.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the length being doubled. So if you double L, C becomes twice as much. So the capacitance would be doubled.

Looking at the options, option D says "doubled" which seems correct. But wait, let me double-check. Are there any cases where doubling the length doesn't double the capacitance? Well, in the formula, it's directly proportional. So unless something else changes, like the dielectric or the radii, but the question doesn't mention any of that. It only changes the length.

So yes, if you double the length, capacitance doubles. So the correct answer should be D: doubled.

The capacitance \( C \) of a coaxial cable is given by the formula:

\[
C = \frac{2 \pi \varepsilon_0 \varepsilon_r L}{\ln(b/a)}
\]

where \( L \) is the length of the cable, \( \varepsilon_0 \) is the vacuum permittivity, \( \varepsilon_r \) is the relative permittivity of the dielectric, and \( \ln(b/a) \) depends on the radii of the inner and outer conductors. From this formula, it is evident that \( C \) is directly proportional to \( L \). Therefore, if the length \( L \) is doubled, the capacitance \( C \) will also double, assuming all other parameters remain constant.

Given the options, the correct answer is:

**D: doubled.**
