Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about group performance tasks. Hmm. Let me read it again. The question says, "A group's performance on a(n) __________ task is limited by the performance of the least skilled or knowledgeable member of the group." The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one.

I remember that in group dynamics, tasks are often categorized based on how the group's performance is influenced by individual members. There are different types like additive, conjunctive, disjunctive, etc. Let me try to recall what each means.

Additive tasks are those where the group's total output is the sum of each member's contribution. Like if everyone is collecting widgets and you just add them up—so the more people, the more total output. That doesn't seem to fit this question because the question is about the group's performance being limited by the weakest member.

Conjunctive tasks, I think, are ones where the group's success depends on every member's performance. Like if you're doing a group project and each person has a critical part—if one person fails, the whole group fails. Or maybe a task where everyone needs to work together, and the weakest link holds everyone back. That sounds exactly like what the question is describing. So the group's performance can't exceed the weakest member's capability.

Then there's disjunctive tasks, which are the opposite. Here, the group's success depends on at least one member succeeding. Like in brainstorming—only one person needs to come up with a good idea. So the group's performance isn't limited by the weakest but can be boosted by the strongest.

So putting it together, the question is looking for a task type where the group's overall performance is capped by the least skilled person. That must be a conjunctive task. So the answer should be B: conjunctive.

The correct answer is B: conjunctive. In a conjunctive task, the group's performance is limited by the least skilled or knowledgeable member because success depends on every member's contribution.
