Question:

A person owned property next to a highway. After raking leaves on his property into a large pile, the landowner loaded the leaves into several large metal barrels so that he could burn the leaves. Before starting the fire, the landowner telephoned the local weather bureau to determine which direction the wind would be blowing. Because a highway was located on the southern edge of his property, he was aware that it would be unsafe to burn the leaves if the wind was blowing in that direction. The weather bureau, however, indicated that the wind would be gusting in a northerly direction. Shortly after the landowner set the leaves on fire, the wind current unexpectedly shifted and started gusting in a southerly direction. As a consequence, the smoke and ashes blew over the highway, resulting in poor visibility. Moments later, a motorist was driving his automobile on the highway in a westerly direction. The posted speed limit was 45 m. p. h. , although the driver was traveling about 55 m. p. h. The driver could not see the highway clearly and crashed his vehicle into a median strip. If the driver asserts a claim against the landowner, the most likely result is

Options:

A: the driver will prevail, if he can prove that the landowner's actions directly resulted in the accident.
B: the driver will prevail, because the landowner should have anticipated the wind change.
C: the landowner will prevail, if the driver cannot prove that the smoke caused the accident.
D: the driver will prevail, if the smoke from the burning leaves prevented him from clearly seeing the roadway.
E: the driver will prevail, because the landowner will be strictly liable for causing the accident.
F: the landowner will prevail, because burning leaves on private property is not against the law.
G: the landowner will prevail, because he called the weather bureau before starting the fire.
H: the driver will prevail, because the landowner should have placed warnings on the highway.
I: the landowner will prevail, because the driver was driving in excess of the speed limit.
J: the landowner will prevail, if his decision to burn the leaves was reasonable under the circumstances.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question here. Let me read through it carefully. 

So, the situation is that a landowner owns property next to a highway. He raked leaves into a pile and put them into metal barrels to burn them. Before burning, he called the weather bureau to check the wind direction because he knew burning towards the highway (which is on the southern edge) would be unsafe. The weather bureau said the wind would be coming from the north, so it should blow away from the highway. But then, the wind unexpectedly shifted to the south, blowing smoke and ashes over the highway, causing poor visibility. 

A motorist was driving west on the highway, going 55 in a 45 zone. He couldn't see clearly because of the smoke and crashed into the median. Now, the driver is suing the landowner. The question is about who would win.

I remember that in tort law, especially negligence, the key elements are duty, breach, causation, and damages. So, the landowner had a duty to act reasonably to prevent harm to others. He called the weather bureau, which shows he tried to be careful. But the wind changed unexpectedly. 

The driver was speeding, which is a factor. But the main issue is whether the landowner's actions were negligent. Did he breach his duty of care? If he took reasonable precautions (like checking the wind), then maybe he isn't liable, especially if the wind shift was unforeseeable. 

Looking at the options:

Option A says the driver wins if he proves the actions directly caused the accident. But causation might not be enough if the landowner wasn't negligent.

Option B says the driver wins because the landowner should have anticipated the wind change. But if the wind change was unexpected and the landowner checked the forecast, maybe he didn't breach the duty.

Option C says the landowner wins if the driver can't prove smoke caused the accident. But the question says the smoke did cause poor visibility, so maybe this isn't the right choice.

Option D says the driver wins if the smoke prevented clear view. This sounds like it's about causation but doesn't address whether the landowner was negligent.

Option E says strict liability, but burning leaves isn't an inherently dangerous activity like keeping wild animals, so probably not strict liability.

Option F says landowner wins because it's not illegal. But legality isn't the main issue—negligence is. So maybe not.

Option G says landowner wins because he called the weather bureau. This suggests he acted reasonably, so no breach.

Option H says driver wins because landowner should have put warnings. I don't think the landowner had a duty to do that; he was burning on his property, not on the highway.

Option I says landowner wins because driver was speeding. Contributory negligence or comparative fault could reduce the driver's recovery, but if the landowner was negligent, the driver's speeding might not bar the claim entirely, depending on jurisdiction.

Option J says landowner wins if his decision was reasonable. Checking the weather seems reasonable, so this makes sense.

So, thinking about it, the landowner took a reasonable precaution by checking the wind direction. The wind shift was unexpected, so he didn't breach his duty. Therefore, the driver might not prevail because the landowner wasn't negligent. 

Looking at the options again, option J seems to fit because it's about the reasonableness of the landowner's decision. So the answer is J.

The question revolves around a negligence claim where a landowner burned leaves, causing smoke to blow onto a highway due to an unexpected wind shift, leading to a motorist's accident. To determine liability, the elements of negligence—duty, breach, causation, and damages—must be analyzed. The landowner took precautions by checking the wind direction with the weather bureau, indicating reasonable care. The wind shift was unforeseen, suggesting no breach of duty. The driver's speeding complicates the claim but does not absolve the landowner of liability if negligence is proven. However, the landowner's reasonable actions likely shield him from liability.

**Option J** correctly states that the landowner will prevail if his decision to burn the leaves was reasonable under the circumstances, which aligns with the facts provided.
