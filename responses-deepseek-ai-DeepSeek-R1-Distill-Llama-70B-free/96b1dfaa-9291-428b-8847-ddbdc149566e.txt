Okay, so I've got this question about self-instructional training for impulsive children. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question is asking what self-instructional training involves. The options are A through F. I remember that self-instructional techniques are about teaching kids to manage their own behavior, right? So it's probably something related to self-control or self-monitoring.

Option A says using frequent breaks to manage energy. That might help with hyperactivity, but I'm not sure if that's the main focus of self-instructional training. It sounds more like a behavioral management strategy rather than teaching self-instruction.

Option B suggests changing self-statements to increase task-oriented behavior. Oh wait, self-instructional training often involves teaching children to use positive self-talk. Like, helping them replace impulsive thoughts with more constructive ones. This makes sense because it's about internalizing control, so B looks promising.

Option C is incorporating more physical activities. While physical activity can help with excess energy, it's more of a environmental adjustment rather than a self-instruction method. So probably not the answer.

Option D talks about using electronic devices to distract. That doesn't seem right. Distraction might not address the root issue of impulsivity and could be counterproductive.

Option E is suppressing impulses through punishment. Punishment might stop the behavior in the moment, but it doesn't teach the child how to manage their impulses themselves. Self-instruction is more about teaching skills than punishment.

Option F is increasing social interactions. Social skills are important, but again, the question is about self-instruction, which is more about the individual's internal processes rather than interactions with others.

Putting it all together, the correct answer should be B. It's about changing their self-statements to become more task-oriented, which aligns with teaching self-regulation techniques.

The correct answer is B: change their self-statements to increase their task-oriented behavior. Self-instructional training focuses on teaching children to manage their own behavior through internal strategies, such as positive self-talk, to replace impulsive reactions with more constructive ones.
