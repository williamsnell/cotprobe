Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about a block being dragged along a table, and it's experiencing a frictional force, f, opposing its movement. The question is asking about the force exerted on the block by the table. The options are from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that when objects are in contact, forces between them can come in pairs, like action-reaction pairs. But wait, friction is a force that acts between two surfaces in contact. So when the block is dragged, the table exerts a frictional force on the block opposing the motion. But the question is specifically about the force exerted by the table on the block. Wait, isn't that the frictional force itself?

Wait no, the frictional force is what's opposing the movement. So the force the table exerts on the block is the frictional force. But let me think again. When you drag the block, your hand exerts a force on the block in the direction of motion. The table's surface is moving past the block, so the friction from the table opposes that. So the frictional force f is the force the table applies on the block.

Wait, but the question is asking about the force exerted by the table on the block. So that's the normal force, right? Because the table pushes up on the block to support its weight. The normal force is perpendicular to the table's surface. Oh, wait, but wait—no, the normal force is from the table to the block, which is perpendicular. But the frictional force is also exerted by the table on the block, but in a different direction.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let's break it down. The table exerts two forces on the block: the normal force (perpendicular to the table) and the frictional force (parallel to the table, opposing the motion). So the question is asking about which force—wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again: "The force exerted on the block by the table is..." So which one? Because the table exerts two forces: normal and frictional.

Wait, the way the question is phrased is a bit tricky. Let me think. Oh, wait—no, the question says the block experiences a frictional force f that opposes movement. So the table's exerting that f as friction. So the question is about what the table's force on the block is. So that's the frictional force, which is f.

Wait, but the options are about the characteristics of that force. Let's look at the options.

Option A: parallel to the table. Well, frictional force is indeed parallel to the surface, so that's correct. But is that the only correct option? Let me check others.

Option B: equal to the frictional force. Hmm, equal to f. Wait, but the force exerted by the table is f, so this would be saying it's equal to itself. That doesn't make much sense. Wait, no—if the block is dragged with force F, then the frictional force would be f, and perhaps F is equal to f if it's moving at constant velocity. But the question doesn't specify that. So I'm not sure. But the question is about the force that the table exerts, which is f. So if the question is asking about the nature of that force, then the options are about its characteristics.

Option C: opposite direction of movement. That's correct because friction opposes motion. So the frictional force is in the opposite direction of the movement. So that's correct.

Option D: perpendicular to the table. That's the normal force, not the frictional force. So that's not correct.

Option E: in the direction of movement. No, friction is opposite, so E is wrong.

Option F: zero. No, because the block is moving, so friction exists.

Option G: equal to gravitational force. Only true if the normal force equals weight, but that's the normal force, not the frictional. So G is wrong.

Option H: neither parallel nor perpendicular. No, friction is parallel, so H is wrong.

Option I: always greater than frictional force. Wait, the force exerted by the table is the frictional force, so this would mean f is greater than f, which doesn't make sense. So I is wrong.

Option J: always less than frictional force. Similarly, no, because the force is f, so J is wrong.

So looking back, the question is about the force exerted by the table. So the frictional force is one of them, and the options are about its properties.

Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again: "The force exerted on the block by the table is..." So the table exerts both normal and frictional forces on the block. But the options are about the force's direction, etc.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the normal force. Or is it referring to the frictional force?

Wait, the question states that the block experiences a frictional force f. So the table is exerting that f on the block as friction. So the question is about that f force.

So the options are about the characteristics of this f force.

So looking at the options:

Option A: parallel to the table. Correct, because friction is along the surface.

Option B: equal to the frictional force. Well, the force is f, so this would be a tautology. It's equal to itself, which is always true, but perhaps not the intended answer.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering other forces. Let me think again. Maybe I misread the question.

Wait, the question says, the block is dragged and experiences a frictional force f opposing movement. So the force exerted by the table is the normal force, which is perpendicular, and the frictional force, which is parallel. So the question is about the force exerted by the table, but which one? Because the table applies two forces.

Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. It just says "the force". But maybe the options can help. Let's look at each option.

Option A: parallel to the table. So that's the frictional force. So if the correct answer is that the force is frictional, then A is correct.

Option D: perpendicular to the table. That would be the normal force.

But the question is about the force that the table exerts. So if the question is asking about the normal force, then D is correct. But the question mentions frictional force f, which is the force from the table opposing movement. So perhaps the question is referring to the frictional force.

Wait, the question is a bit unclear. Let me read it again.

"The force exerted on the block by the table is"

Ah, perhaps the intended answer is the normal force, which is perpendicular. Because the table's primary force is the normal force supporting the block. But the frictional force is also a force from the table. So I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, the question is from the table to the block. So the two forces are the normal (perpendicular) and friction (parallel). So the question is asking about one of these.

But the question's wording is a bit ambiguous. However, considering the options, let's think.

Option A is parallel, which would be friction.

Option D is perpendicular, which is normal.

The question is about the force that the table exerts. But in the context, the question is about the force that opposes movement, which is friction. So perhaps the question is referring to the frictional force.

Wait, but the question says, "the force exerted on the block by the table is" with options about its properties.

So if the force in question is the frictional force, then A is correct (parallel), C is correct (opposite direction), and B would be, well, equal to f, which is itself, so that's always true.

Wait, but perhaps the correct answer is A. Because the frictional force is parallel to the table.

Alternatively, option B says "equal to the frictional force." But that's a bit redundant because the force is the frictional force, so it's equal to itself. So perhaps B isn't the intended answer.

Wait, maybe the question is a trick. Because when you push the block, the table exerts friction. But the force that the table exerts is the normal force, which is perpendicular. But I don't think so, because the normal force is not related to the movement direction.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about Newton's third law. The block exerts a force on the table. The table exerts an equal and opposite force on the block. So if the block is moving, say, to the right, the frictional force from the table on the block is to the left, opposing the motion.

So the force exerted by the table on the block is this frictional force, which is parallel to the table (since the table is horizontal, and friction is horizontal).

So option A is correct: parallel to the table.

Wait, but another angle: the question might be trying to refer to the normal force. Because the table supports the block, but that's the normal force, which is perpendicular. But the question mentions the frictional force f, so the force in question is likely the frictional force.

So putting it together, the options are:

A: parallel — correct.

C: opposite direction — correct.

So which of these is an option?

Looking at the options, the question is about the force's characteristics. So the correct answer would be A, because the frictional force is parallel to the table.

But wait, let me look at the options again:

Option B says "equal to the frictional force." Well, the force is the frictional force, so yes, it's equal to itself. But that seems redundant. So perhaps the intended answer is A.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the normal force. Because the force exerted by the table is the normal force, which is perpendicular. But the question's context is about the frictional force. Hmm.

I'm a bit confused, but perhaps I should focus on the options again.

The question is: what is the force exerted by the table on the block.

That force is either the normal force (perpendicular) or the frictional force (parallel). Which one is being referred to in the question?

The question begins by stating that the block experiences a frictional force f opposing movement. So the force the table exerts is that frictional force f. So the options describe properties of this f.

So looking at the options, which describe f.

Option A: parallel to table — yes, correct.

Option C: opposite direction of movement — yes, correct.

So looking at the options given:

A is correct.

So the correct answer is A.

Wait, but option B says "equal to the frictional force." Well, the force is the frictional force, so it's equal to itself. But that's obvious, so perhaps B is not the intended answer.

So I think the correct answer is A.
</think>

The question asks about the force exerted on the block by the table, specifically in the context of a block being dragged along a table and experiencing a frictional force, \( f \), that opposes its movement. The table exerts two forces on the block: the normal force (perpendicular to the table) and the frictional force (parallel to the table). The question focuses on the frictional force, as it is explicitly mentioned as opposing the block's movement.

### Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A: Parallel to the table**  
   The frictional force exerted by the table on the block is parallel to the table's surface, as it acts horizontally when the table is horizontal. This is correct.

2. **Option B: Equal to the frictional force**  
   This option is redundant because the force exerted by the table is the frictional force itself. While technically true, it does not describe a characteristic of the force and is not the best answer.

3. **Option C: In the opposite direction of movement**  
   The frictional force opposes the motion of the block, so it acts in the opposite direction of movement. This is correct.

4. **Option D: Perpendicular to the table**  
   This describes the normal force, not the frictional force. Since the question focuses on the frictional force, this is incorrect.

5. **Option E: In the direction of movement**  
   Friction always opposes movement, so this is incorrect.

6. **Option F: Zero**  
   The block is moving, so friction is present and not zero. This is incorrect.

7. **Option G: Equal to the gravitational force**  
   This would only apply to the normal force in certain cases, not the frictional force. This is incorrect.

8. **Option H: Neither parallel nor perpendicular to the table**  
   Friction is parallel to the table, so this is incorrect.

9. **Option I: Always greater than the frictional force**  
   The force exerted by the table is the frictional force itself, so this is incorrect.

10. **Option J: Always less than the frictional force**  
    Similarly, this is incorrect because the force exerted by the table is the frictional force.

### Conclusion:
The frictional force exerted by the table on the block is parallel to the table. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: Parallel to the table**

Answer: A
