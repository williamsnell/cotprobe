Okay, so I've got this math problem here about balloons and packages. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The question says that balloons come in packages of 8, and I need 42 of them. The options given are A to J, with different numbers. So I need to find out how many packages I should buy to have at least 42 balloons.

First, I think I should divide the total number of balloons needed by the number in each package. That makes sense because each package has 8, so if I divide 42 by 8, I should get the number of packages needed.

Let me do the division: 42 divided by 8. Hmm, 8 times 5 is 40, which is less than 42. 8 times 6 is 48, which is more than 42. So 42/8 equals 5.25. Wait, but you can't buy a fraction of a package. So I can't buy 0.25 of a package; I have to round up to the next whole number.

So that means I need 6 packages. Because 5 packages would give me 40 balloons, which isn't enough. I need 42, so I have to go up to 6. 6 packages would give me 48 balloons, which is more than enough, but that's okay because you can't buy a partial package.

Looking at the options, option C is 6, so that should be the correct answer. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 8 times 5 is 40, which is less than 42, so 5 isn't enough. 8 times 6 is 48, which covers the needed 42. Yep, that makes sense. So the answer should be C.

To determine how many packages of 8 balloons are needed to have at least 42 balloons, divide 42 by 8. 

42 รท 8 = 5.25. Since you can't purchase a fraction of a package, round up to the next whole number, which is 6. 

Thus, 6 packages are required.

Answer: C
