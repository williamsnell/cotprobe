Okay, so I have this problem about a venturimeter, and I'm supposed to find the maximum discharge of water at 32°F. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

Wait, the question gives me a 3-inch venturimeter with a coefficient of velocity of 0.95. Oh right, the coefficient of velocity (Cv) is used in flow meter calculations. And the inlet pressure is 24 psia. Oh, and we need to make sure there's no cavitation. So I guess that relates to the pressure at the throat not dropping below the vapor pressure of water?

Right, cavitation happens when the pressure at a point in the flow (like the throat of the venturi) drops below the vapor pressure of the fluid. For water at 32°F, I think the vapor pressure is pretty low. Oh wait, at 32°F (which is 0°C), the vapor pressure of water is about 0.088 psia. So the pressure at the throat can't go below that.

The formula for discharge (Q) in a venturi is Q = (Cv * A * sqrt(2 * (P_inlet - P_throat) / w)) ). Wait, or is it using the pressure difference? Oh wait, the general equation comes from Bernoulli's equation. The flow rate depends on the area, the velocity, and the pressure difference.

Wait, since it's a venturi, the discharge can be calculated using the equation Q = A * V, where V is the velocity at the throat. But how to get V? Oh right, using the pressure difference. So maybe the velocity is calculated using Torricelli's law, adjusted by the coefficient of velocity.

Oh, right, the velocity V at the throat is given by V = Cv * sqrt( (2 (P_in - P_throat) ) / w ), where w is the specific weight of water. Wait, but in this case, we need to make sure that P_throat doesn't drop below the vapor pressure. So the maximum allowable pressure drop is when P_throat is equal to the vapor pressure.

So, let's put this together. The maximum discharge occurs when the pressure at the throat is at its minimum allowable, which is the vapor pressure. So P_throat = Pv = 0.088 psia.

Wait, but P_inlet is 24 psia, so the pressure difference is 24 - 0.088 = 23.912 psi. Hmm, that's a big pressure drop. But that's what we need to prevent cavitation.

Now, the specific weight (w) of water. At 32°F, which is 0°C, the specific weight is about 62.4 lb/ft³. Wait, but let me make sure. Yeah, 62.4 lb per cubic foot is correct for water at around that temperature.

The area A of the throat. The venturi is 3 inches in diameter, so the radius is 1.5 inches. Area A is πr², but wait, in feet, right? Because the units have to be consistent.

Wait, 3 inches is 0.25 feet. So radius is 0.125 feet. So area A = π*(0.125)^2 = π*(0.015625) ≈ 0.04909 ft².

Wait, no. Wait, 3 inches is 0.25 feet diameter, so radius is 0.125 ft. So area is π*(0.125)^2 = π*(0.015625) = approximately 0.0491 ft².

So now, putting it all together. The velocity V is Cv * sqrt(2*(P_in - P_throat)/w).

Wait, P_in is in psia, but when calculating, we need the units to be consistent. So, 24 psia minus 0.088 psia is about 23.912 psi. The specific weight w is 62.4 lb/ft³.

Wait, since pressure is force per area, and specific weight is force per volume, so when we take (P_in - P_throat) / w, the units would be (lb/ft²) / (lb/ft³) )= ft. So the sqrt(2*(P - Pv)/w) would have units of sqrt(ft), which is feet per second when squared.

Wait, but let me make sure of the formula. The velocity V is given by V = Cv * sqrt( (2 (P_in - P_throat)) / (w) ) * (1/factor for unit conversion?), but wait, units are in the English system here.

Wait, because in the English system, pressure in psi, specific weight in lb/ft³, and area in ft², the units should work out. Let me check the units.

The term (P_in - P_throat) is in lb/in². Oh wait, because psi is lb per square inch. So to convert to lb/ft², we multiply by 144 (since 1 ft² = 144 in²). So (P_in - P_throat) in lb/ft² is (24 - 0.088) psi * 144 lb/ft² per psi.

Wait, wait no. Let me think. 1 psi is 1 lb/in². So to convert to lb/ft², since 1 ft = 12 inches, 1 ft² = (12 in)^2 = 144 in². So 1 lb/in² = 144 lb/ft². So (24 - 0.088) psi equals (24 - 0.088) * 144 lb/ft².

So the term inside the square root is [2*(24-0.088)*144 ] / 62.4.

Calculate that step by step.

First, 24 - 0.088 = 23.912 psi.

Multiply by 144 lb/ft² per psi: 23.912 * 144 = let's calculate that.

23 * 144 = 3312, 0.912 * 144 = approx 131.3 (0.9*144=129.6, 0.012*144=1.728 → 131.328). So total is 3312 + 131.328 = 3443.328 lb/ft².

Multiply by 2: 2 * 3443.328 = 6886.656.

Now divide by 62.4: 6886.656 / 62.4 ≈ let's see, 62.4 * 110 = 6864. So 6886.656 - 6864 = 22.656. So 110 + (22.656/62.4) ≈ 110 + 0.363 = 110.363.

So sqrt(110.363) ≈ 10.51 ft/s.

But wait, V = Cv * sqrt(2 (P_in - P_throat)/w). So in this case, Cv is 0.95, so V ≈ 0.95 * 10.51 ≈ 9.984 ft/s.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation. Let me compute [2*(24 - 0.088)*144]/62.4.

Which is [2*(23.912)*144]/62.4.

Compute numerator: 2 * 23.912 = 47.824; 47.824 * 144 = let's compute 47 * 144 = 6768, 0.824 * 144 = approx 118.5. So total numerator is 6768 + 118.5 = 6886.5.

So 6886.5 / 62.4 = approximately 6886.5 ÷ 62.4 ≈ 110.36. Square root is about 10.51. Multiply by 0.95: 10.51 * 0.95 ≈ 9.984 ft/s.

So velocity is approximately 9.984 ft/s.

Then the discharge Q is A * V. So area A is 0.04909 ft².

So Q = 0.04909 ft² * 9.984 ft/s ≈ 0.04909 * 10 ≈ 0.4909, but more precisely, 0.04909 * 9.984.

Let me compute 0.04909 * 10 = 0.4909. But since it's 9.984, it's 0.4909 * (9.984/10) = 0.4909 * 0.9984 ≈ 0.4904 (approx).

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately. 0.04909 * 9.984.

0.04909 * 9 = 0.44181, 0.04909 * 0.984 = approx 0.04909 * (1 - 0.016) = 0.04909 - (0.04909 * 0.016) ≈ 0.04909 - 0.000786 ≈ 0.0483. So total is 0.44181 + 0.0483 ≈ 0.4901.

So Q ≈ 0.4901 cubic feet per second.

But wait, what's the unit of discharge here? It's in cfs. The question is asking for the maximum discharge, so the answer would be in cfs. But looking at the options, let's see: they are all numbers without units. So perhaps I need to convert cfs into another unit, maybe gallons per minute or something else? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, no, the options are just numbers, but the problem says "determine the maximum discharge of water at 32°F". So the discharge is in cfs, right? So the options are numbers, but I need to see which one matches.

Looking at the options: the closest would be 0.49, but the options given are A:0.62, B:0.5, C:0.75, D:0.7163, E:0.92, etc. So my calculation gives about 0.49 cfs, which is close to option B:0.5.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because 0.49 is just under 0.5, which is option B. But perhaps I made a mistake in the area calculation.

Wait, the diameter is 3 inches, which is 0.25 feet. So radius is 0.125 ft. Area is π*(0.125)^2 = π*(0.015625) ≈ 0.04909 ft². That seems correct. So the area is right.

Wait, maybe I messed up the pressure difference. Oh, wait, maybe the pressure at the throat can't be lower than the vapor pressure, so P_throat = Pv = 0.088 psia. So the pressure difference is 24 - 0.088 = 23.912 psi. That's correct.

Wait, maybe I should use the specific weight in lb/ft³ correctly. So 62.4 lb/ft³ for water.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate the velocity again. Let me compute [2*(24 - 0.088)*144]/62.4.

Wait, 2*(24 - 0.088) = 47.824 psi.

47.824 psi * 144 lb/ft² per psi = 47.824 * 144 = ?

Let me compute 47 * 144 = 6768, 0.824 * 144 = 118.5 (exactly 0.824 * 100 = 82.4, 0.824 *44 = 36.256 → 82.4 +36.256=118.656). So total is 6768 + 118.656 = 6886.656 lb/ft².

Divide by 62.4 lb/ft³: 6886.656 / 62.4 = ?

Let me compute 62.4 * 110 = 62.4*100=6240, 62.4*10=624 → 6864.

6886.656 - 6864 = 22.656.

22.656 / 62.4 = 0.363.

So total is 110.363.

So sqrt(110.363) is about 10.51 ft/s.

Multiply by Cv=0.95 → 10.51 * 0.95 = 9.9845 ft/s.

So Q = A * V = 0.04909 ft² * 9.9845 ft/s ≈ 0.4901 cfs.

Hmm, so 0.49 cfs. The options don't have 0.49, but option B is 0.5. So perhaps the correct answer is B:0.5.

Wait, but let me think again—maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps the formula used is different.

Wait, another approach. The maximum velocity without cavitation occurs when the pressure at the throat is at the vapor pressure. So using the Bernoulli equation, the velocity is V = sqrt( 2 (P_in - Pv) / (w) ), but adjusted by Cv.

Wait, but perhaps the formula for V is V = Cv * sqrt( 2 (P_in - Pv) / w ), but considering units.

Wait, but in that case, the calculation I did earlier should be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used different units for pressure. Oh wait, another approach: convert the pressure into head of water, which is in feet.

So pressure in psi can be converted to feet of water. Since 1 psi = 2.3066 feet of water.

So P_in =24 psia = 24 * 2.3066 ≈ 55.318 feet.

Pv =0.088 psia = 0.088 * 2.3066 ≈ 0.2029 feet.

So the head difference is 55.318 - 0.2029 ≈ 55.115 feet.

Then the velocity V = Cv * sqrt(2gh), where g is 32.2 ft/s².

So V = 0.95 * sqrt( 2 * 32.2 * 55.115 )

Calculate inside the sqrt: 2 *32.2=64.4. 64.4 *55.115 ≈ 64 *55 = 3520, 64*0.115≈7.36, 0.4*55=22, 0.4*0.115=0.046 → total ≈ 3520 +7.36=3527.36 +22=3549.36 +0.046=3549.4.

Wait, but let me compute 64.4 *55.115 properly.

Let me compute 64 *55 = 3520. 64 * 0.115 = 7.36. 0.4 *55=22, 0.4 *0.115=0.046. So total is 3520 +7.36 +22 +0.046= 3520 +29.406=3549.406.

So sqrt(3549.406) ≈ 59.58 ft/s.

Multiply by 0.95 → 59.58 *0.95 = 56.6 ft/s.

Wait, that can't be right because that's a much higher velocity. But earlier calculation gave about 10 ft/s, so I must have made a mistake in units here.

Wait, no, wait. Because when I converted to head in feet, maybe I should have used the correct approach. Hmmm, perhaps this method is confusing because I'm mixing units. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the correct formula is V = sqrt(2 (P_in - P_throat) / (w)) ) * Cv. But perhaps I need to express the pressure in consistent units.

Wait, another approach: the pressure difference in psi needs to be converted into lb/ft², then divided by w in lb/ft³ to get ft²/s², take sqrt to get ft/s.

So, (P_in - Pv) = 23.912 psi = 23.912 * 144 lb/ft² = 3443.328 lb/ft².

Then, (2 * 3443.328) / 62.4 = (6886.656) /62.4 ≈ 110.363 ft²/s².

Square root is sqrt(110.363)=10.51 ft/s. Multiply by Cv=0.95 → 9.984 ft/s.

So, Q = A * V = 0.04909 ft² * 9.984 ft/s ≈0.4901 cfs.

So again, 0.49 cfs. Closest option is B:0.5.

Wait, but wait. I'm using the formula correctly, right? Because the discharge for a venturi is based on the area at the throat and the velocity there, since that's where the flow is fastest.

Yes, that's correct. So the calculation should be correct.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option D is 0.7163, which is higher than 0.5. So perhaps I made a mistake in the area calculation. Let me check that again.

Wait, the diameter is 3 inches, which is 0.25 feet. So radius is 0.125 ft. Area is π*(0.125)^2 = π*(0.015625) = approx 0.0491 ft².

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should have used the approach considering the venturi's throat diameter and the inlet diameter. But no, the maximum velocity occurs at the throat, so the area is based on the throat diameter, which is the smallest part.

Alternatively, perhaps I forgot that the discharge can be calculated differently, considering the flow is based on the inlet area, but that's not the case. No, the venturi's discharge depends on the throat area.

Wait, but another possibility: Maybe the problem is asking for the discharge in gallons per minute (gpm) instead of cubic feet per second (cfs). Because 0.49 cfs is about 3.26 gpm, which is much lower than any of the options. So that can't be the case. So the options must be in cfs.

Wait, but looking back, the options are A:0.62, B:0.5, etc. So my calculation is 0.49, which is close to 0.5, so option B.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the Cv. Cv is the coefficient of velocity, which is 0.95. So that seems correct.

Wait, another thing. The specific weight of water at 32°F is 62.4 lb/ft³. So that's correct.

Hmm, so I think the correct answer is approximately 0.49 cfs, which matches option B:0.5.

But wait, looking at the options, option D is 0.7163. That's about 0.716, which is higher than my result. So where could I have gone wrong?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (P_in - Pv). Let me recheck
