Okay, so I've got this question about municipal accounting, specifically how a city should report its expenditures related to bond payments. Hmm, I remember that governments use different funds for different purposes. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that Poplar City paid $5,000 interest and $20,000 principal on its general obligation bonds. The payment was made from a debt service fund, but the cash was transferred from the general fund earlier in the same year.

Wait, so the debt service fund is the one that made the actual payment. But the general fund transferred the money there. I think when the general fund transfers money to another fund, it's like an interfund transfer. So for the general fund, that would probably be an expense, right? Or is it treated differently?

I recall that in governmental accounting, when a transfer is made from the general fund to another fund, the general fund records it as an expenditure, and the receiving fund records it as a transfer in. So in this case, the general fund transferred money to the debt service fund, which then used that money to pay the bonds.

So the general fund's expenditure would be the amount it transferred, which I think is the sum of the principal and interest because that's the total payment made. So that's $5,000 + $20,000 = $25,000. So the general fund would show an expenditure of $25,000.

But wait, the question is about how each fund reports the expenditures. The general fund's expenditure is the transfer out, which is $25,000. But the debt service fund actually made the payments. So the debt service fund would report an expenditure when it pays the principal and interest.

Wait, but the debt service fund's expenditures would be for the principal and interest. Or does it separate them? I think the principal payment might be considered a transfer as well because it's reducing the debt. Let me think. In a debt service fund, payments of principal and interest are both considered expenditures. So the debt service fund would report both the $5,000 interest and the $20,000 principal as expenditures, totaling $25,000.

Wait, no, maybe not. Because the principal repayment is more like a transfer back to the general fund or another fund that's handling the debt. Or maybe it's treated as a fund balance transfer. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, when the debt service fund pays the principal, that's a reduction of the long-term debt, but for the fund itself, it's an expenditure. Because the fund is set up to make those payments. So yes, both the interest and principal would be expensed by the debt service fund.

Wait, but I also remember that in the government-wide statements, the principal isn't considered an expense because it's a financial resource. But for the fund financial statements, the debt service fund would report both as expenditures. Because in the fund, they are using their resources to make the payments.

So putting it together: The general fund's expenditure is the $25,000 it transferred to the debt service fund. The debt service fund's expenditures are the $25,000 it spent on principal and interest.

Wait, but looking at the options, I need to pick the one where the general fund has $25,000, the debt service fund has $25,000, and the permanent fund has $0. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option J says $25,000 for general, $25,000 for debt service, and $0 for permanent. Option I is general $0, debt service $25k. Option A is general $25k, debt service $5k. Wait, that can't be right because the debt service fund made both payments.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing something up. The general fund's expenditure is when it transfers the money to the debt service fund. So when the general fund transfers $25k to the debt service fund, that's an expenditure for the general fund. The debt service fund then uses that money to pay the bonds, which is an expenditure of $25k for the debt service fund.

So both funds have expenditures of $25,000 each. Wait, but that seems like double-counting. Because the same money is being spent in both funds. But in fund accounting, each fund's transactions are separate.

So the general fund's expenditure is the transfer out. The debt service fund's expenditure is the payment. So both are correct in their respective funds.

Looking back at the options, let's see:

Option J: $25,000 (General), $25,000 (Debt Service), $0 (Permanent). That seems to fit.

Other options: Option I is $0, $25k, $0. That would only account for the debt service fund's expenditure, but not the general fund's. So that's not correct.

Option H: $25k, $0, $5k. No, because the debt service fund did make the payments.

Option A: $25k, $5k, $0. That would imply the debt service fund only expensed the interest, which I don't think is right because the principal should also be expensed.

Wait, does the principal payment get treated differently? Hmm. Because in the debt service fund, when you pay the principal, you're reducing the liability, but for the fund's financial statements, it's an expenditure. So yes, both are expensed.

So the answer should be both funds have $25k each. That's option J: $25,000, $25,000, $0.

Wait, wait, let me double-check. The general fund's expenditure is the transfer to the debt service fund. So yes, $25k. The debt service fund's expenditure is the total payment of $25k. So both have $25k each. So the correct reporting is general fund $25k, debt service $25k, and permanent fund $0.

So looking at the options, J is the correct one.

In municipal accounting, the general fund and debt service fund have distinct roles in reporting expenditures. The general fund transfers money to the debt service fund to cover bond payments, and this transfer is recorded as an expenditure by the general fund. The debt service fund, in turn, uses these funds to pay both the principal and interest on the bonds, which are also recorded as expenditures by the debt service fund. 

In this case, the general fund transferred $25,000 ($5,000 interest + $20,000 principal) to the debt service fund, so the general fund reports an expenditure of $25,000. The debt service fund then used the $25,000 to pay the bond obligations, so it also reports an expenditure of $25,000. The permanent fund is not involved in this transaction, so it reports $0.

Among the options provided, the correct one is:

**J: $25,000 (General fund), $25,000 (Debt service fund), $0 (Permanent fund).**

Answer: J
