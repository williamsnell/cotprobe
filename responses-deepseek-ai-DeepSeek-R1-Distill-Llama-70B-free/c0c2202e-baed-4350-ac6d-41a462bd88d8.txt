Question:

Congress has recently enacted a statute designed to prevent price gouging of gasoline by private retail sellers. To help administer the new statute Congress created a seven-member agency, four members of which were appointed by the President, two by the Senate, and one by the Speaker of the House. The agency was authorized to issue rules interpreting regulations prescribed under existing federal law. It was also authorized to issue "cease and desist" orders after hearings against private retail sellers of gasoline who "intentionally engaged in price gouging. " In this regard, violations of the cease and desist orders were made punishable by fine and/or imprisonment. Which of the following is the strongest constitutional argument against the authority of this agency?

Options:

A: Congress may not delegate to the agency power to interpret regulations without the approval of the President.
B: Congress may not delegate to the agency power to issue fines.
C: Congress may not delegate to the agency power to imprison private citizens.
D: Congress may not delegate enforcement of a federal law in any governmental body other than the U. S. Attorney General or the courts.
E: Congress may not delegate to the agency power to make "cease and desist" orders, the violation of which is punishable by imprisonment.
F: Congress may not delegate to the agency power to make interpretations of existing federal laws.
G: Congress may not create an agency to regulate private business practices.
H: Congress may not delegate to the agency power to regulate prices.
I: Congress may not retain the power to appoint even a minority of members of such an agency.
J: Congress may not delegate power to an agency without the approval of the Supreme Court.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about constitutional law, specifically dealing with the delegation of power by Congress to an agency. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question describes a scenario where Congress created a seven-member agency. Four members are appointed by the President, two by the Senate, and one by the Speaker of the House. This agency has the authority to issue rules interpreting existing federal laws and can issue "cease and desist" orders against private retail sellers who intentionally engage in price gouging. Violations of these orders can result in fines and/or imprisonment.

The question is asking which constitutional argument is the strongest against the agency's authority. The options are from A to J.

First, I need to recall the relevant constitutional principles. The main issue here seems to be the separation of powers and whether Congress can delegate certain powers to an agency without violating the Constitution.

I remember that Congress can delegate legislative power to administrative agencies as long as it provides an intelligible principle to guide the agency's discretion. That's the non-delegation doctrine. However, this isn't about delegation to the executive branch; it's about how the agency is structured.

Wait, another key point is the appointments clause. The Appointments Clause in Article II, Section 2, Clause 1 states that certain officers must be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. These are called principal officers. So, if the agency is composed of principal officers, they need to be appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.

In this case, the agency has seven members. Four are appointed by the President (so that's fine), two by the Senate, and one by the Speaker. Wait, the Senate appointing members? That doesn't fit with the usual process. The President appoints with Senate consent, not the Senate itself appointing. Also, the Speaker of the House appointing a memberâ€”that's part of the legislative branch, which isn't supposed to appoint executive officers.

So the problem is that the appointments are being made by different branches. The Appointments Clause requires that principal officers be appointed by the President with Senate confirmation. If the agency is considered part of the executive branch, then having members appointed by the Senate and the Speaker might be unconstitutional because the Senate can't appoint, and neither can the Speaker as part of the legislative branch.

Wait, but wait, the agency's structure is that it's a seven-member body. The President appoints four, the Senate two, and the Speaker one. So, the majority are appointed by the President, but others are appointed by different branches. That might be problematic because, under the Appointments Clause, only the President can appoint principal officers, with the Senate's consent. If the agency is an executive agency, then all the members should be appointed by the President, possibly with Senate confirmation.

So looking at the answer choices, which one aligns with this issue? Let's look at the options.

Option I says: Congress may not retain the power to appoint even a minority of members of such an agency. Wait, but in this case, the appointments are made by the Senate and the Speaker, not Congress as a whole. The Senate is part of Congress, but the Speaker is part of the House. So perhaps the issue is that Congress is appointing some members, which violates the separation of powers because appointment of executive officers is an executive function.

Alternatively, the issue is that the agency is a legislative or executive agency. If it's an executive agency, the President should appoint all members. If it's a legislative agency, then Congress can appoint, but that's rare.

Wait, in Buckley v. Valeo (1976), the Supreme Court held that Congress can't appoint members of an executive agency because it violates the separation of powers. So if this agency is part of the executive branch, then allowing the Senate and Speaker to appoint members is unconstitutional.

So looking back at the options, option I says Congress may not retain the power to appoint even a minority of members. But actually, it's more about Congress appointing any members, not just a minority. Because the Appointments Clause requires that principal officers be appointed by the President with Senate consent.

So the strongest argument is that the structure of the agency violates the Appointments Clause because members are appointed by the Senate and the Speaker, not just the President.

Looking at the options, option I seems to fit because it's about Congress appointing members. But let me check the other options.

Option E says Congress may not delegate to the agency power to make "cease and desist" orders, the violation of which is punishable by imprisonment. Hmm. Well, agencies can issue such orders. The issue would be if the agency is exercising judicial power, but I think that's more about whether the functions are judicial or executive. But I don't think that's the strongest argument here compared to the appointments issue.

Option C says Congress may not delegate power to imprison. But Congress can delegate enforcement powers, including imposing fines and imprisonment, as long as it's done through proper delegation. So that's probably not the strongest argument.

Option G says Congress may not create an agency to regulate private business. But Congress can regulate under the Commerce Clause, so that's not a strong argument.

So the strongest argument is about the appointments violating the Appointments Clause. So the correct answer should be option I, which states that Congress may not retain the power to appoint even a minority of the agency members.

Wait, but wait. The question says the agency was created by Congress, and the appointments are made by different branches. So the issue is that the Senate and the Speaker are making appointments, which is not allowed because the Appointments Clause requires that principal officers be appointed by the President with Senate consent. So in this case, the members appointed by the Senate and the Speaker are not following that process. So the appointments are unconstitutional because they're being made by the wrong branch.

So the argument is that the agency's structure violates the Appointments Clause because the appointments are made by the Senate and the Speaker, which is not allowed.

Looking at the options again, option I says Congress may not retain the power to appoint even a minority of the members. So yes, that's correct. Because Congress cannot appoint any members if they are principal officers; the President must appoint them with Senate consent.

Therefore, the strongest constitutional argument is option I.

The question revolves around the constitutionality of a seven-member agency created by Congress to regulate gasoline price gouging. The agency's authority includes issuing rules, "cease and desist" orders, and imposing fines and imprisonment for violations. The strongest constitutional argument against the agency's authority lies in its structure and appointments process.

Under the Appointments Clause of Article II, Section 2, Clause 1, principal officers of the executive branch must be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. However, in this case, the agency's members are appointed by multiple branches: four by the President, two by the Senate, and one by the Speaker of the House. This violates the Appointments Clause because the Senate and the Speaker, as part of the legislative branch, cannot appoint executive officers. The Supreme Court has consistently held that Congress cannot appoint members of an executive agency, as this infringes on the separation of powers.

Among the answer choices, option I directly addresses this issue: "Congress may not retain the power to appoint even a minority of members of such an agency." This is the strongest argument because the appointments by the Senate and the Speaker are unconstitutional, as they bypass the President's exclusive authority to appoint executive officers.

Other options, such as challenges to the delegation of enforcement powers or rule-making authority, are weaker because Congress can delegate such powers to agencies as long as proper oversight and guidelines are in place. The appointments issue, however, is a clear and direct violation of constitutional principles.
