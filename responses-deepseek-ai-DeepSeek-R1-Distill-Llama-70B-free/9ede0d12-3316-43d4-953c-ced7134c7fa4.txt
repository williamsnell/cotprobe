Question:

A collector owned a rare 16th-century tapestry. The collector contracted in writing to sell the tapestry to a tapestry dealer for $100,000. The contract stipulated that delivery would be "F. O. B. at the dealer's shop," with payment to be made one week after tender. When the dealer received the tapestry, he noticed that it had been damaged in transit. The dealer immediately contacted the collector and notified him that he was rejecting the tapestry because it had ripped apart and was becoming unwoven. The collector told the dealer that he would get back to him with re-shipping instructions. The collector did not make any further contact with the dealer. After four weeks, the dealer then sold the tapestry to a buyer for $120,000. If the collector sues the dealer for damages, the collector should recover

Options:

A: $20,000, which covers the difference between the contract price and the sale price.
B: $110,000, which includes a 10% penalty on the resale.
C: $100,000, which is the contract price.
D: $120,000, which is the resale price.
E: Nothing, because the dealer acted within his rights after the collector failed to respond.
F: $100,000, because the dealer is entitled to the contract price.
G: $20,000, for the loss of potential profit due to the damaged tapestry.
H: $120,000, for conversion.
I: $108,000, because the dealer is entitled to a reasonable sum not exceeding 10% on the resale.
J: $130,000, including the contract price and a penalty for unauthorized resale.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about a collector and a dealer. Let me read through it again and break it down step by step.

So, the collector owns a rare 16th-century tapestry and contracts to sell it to a dealer for $100,000. The contract says delivery is "F.O.B. at the dealer's shop," and payment is to be made one week after tender. 

Wait, F.O.B. stands for "Free on Board," right? I think that term determines where the risk of loss shifts. So, when it's F.O.B. at the dealer's shop, that would mean that the risk shifts to the dealer once the goods are delivered to the dealer's shop. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing that up. I remember that F.O.B. can be either F.O.B. shipping point or destination. If it's F.O.B. destination, the risk is on the seller until it arrives at the buyer's place. But if it's F.O.B. shipping point, the risk shifts to the buyer once it's shipped. So in this case, it's F.O.B. at the dealer's shop, which I think is the destination. So the collector bears the risk until it arrives at the dealer's shop. Hmm, but wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. If it's F.O.B. destination, the seller is responsible for the goods until they reach the destination. So if it's F.O.B. the dealer's shop, the collector (seller) is responsible for the goods until they arrive there. So any damage during transit would be the collector's responsibility.

But the tapestry was damaged in transit. So when the dealer received it, he noticed it was ripped and becoming unwoven. He immediately contacted the collector, rejecting the tapestry and explaining the damage. The collector said he'd get back with reshipping instructions but didn't contact the dealer again. After four weeks, the dealer sold the tapestry to another buyer for $120,000. Now, the collector is suing the dealer for damages. The question is, how much should the collector recover?

Let me think about the relevant laws here. This seems to be a contracts and sales law issue, probably under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) since we're dealing with goods.

Under UCC Article 2, when a buyer rejects goods, certain rules apply. If the goods are non-conforming, the buyer can reject them, and the seller has the right to cure the defect within a reasonable time. The seller can either repair the goods or offer to replace them. But in this case, the collector didn't respond after the initial contact, so the dealer didn't get any further instructions.

Wait, when the dealer rejected the goods, he notified the collector. The collector was supposed to arrange for reshipping, but didn't. So the dealer, after four weeks, sold the tapestry for a higher price. So the dealer might have resold the goods under UCC §2-706 or §2-603.

Let me think about the options available to the buyer (dealer) when the seller (collector) doesn't cure the defect. If the seller fails to cure within the time allowed, the buyer can treat the contract as avoided and pursue remedies like resale.

In this case, the dealer sold the goods for $120,000. So, perhaps the dealer conducted a resale under UCC §2-706. The dealer would be entitled to the difference between the resale price and the contract price, plus any incidental damages, minus the expenses saved. But wait, in this case, the resale price is higher than the contract price. So the dealer made a profit. But usually, if the resale is at a higher price, the seller (collector) would not owe the dealer anything because the dealer didn't suffer a loss. But wait, maybe the dealer is the one who resold, so perhaps the collector is the one suing for damages because the dealer sold the goods without authority.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is about risk of loss. Since the goods were F.O.B. the dealer's shop, the risk of loss was on the collector until the goods were delivered to the dealer. So if the goods were damaged in transit, the collector is responsible because the risk was still on them. So the dealer could reject the goods, and the collector would be in breach for non-conforming goods.

But the dealer rejected the goods, and the collector didn't respond. So perhaps the dealer, after a reasonable time, treated the contract as breached and resold the goods. Now, the dealer may have the right to recover damages, but the collector is suing the dealer. Wait, the question is, the collector is suing the dealer. So what's the dealer's liability?

Wait, maybe I'm getting this mixed up. Let me outline the facts again:

- Collector (Seller) contracts to sell to Dealer (Buyer) for $100k.
- Delivery F.O.B. dealer's shop. So risk of loss is on the collector until the goods reach the dealer.
- Goods arrive damaged. Dealer rejects and notifies collector. Collector says he'll get back, but doesn't. Dealer, after four weeks, sells to another buyer for $120k.

Now, the collector sues the dealer. What's the issue here? The collector is the plaintiff, so perhaps the issue is that the dealer sold the goods without authority, thereby converting them, or that the dealer didn't have the right to resell because the collector was still trying to fulfill the contract.

Wait, but under UCC §2-606, a buyer can reject goods if they are non-conforming. The seller has the right to cure defects within the time allowed (UCC §2-508). If the seller doesn't cure, the buyer can treat the contract as avoided. But if the seller does cure, then the buyer must accept the goods.

In this case, the collector didn't respond after the initial contact. So the dealer could treat the contract as avoided after a reasonable time. Then, the dealer would be entitled to resell the goods. If the dealer resells under §2-706, any loss on resale can be recovered from the seller. But if the resale is for a higher price, the seller doesn't have to pay the difference. Wait, no, the dealer would get to keep the higher resale price, and the seller would have no claim for additional payment beyond the contract price. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, if the dealer resold the goods and made a profit, that doesn't mean the collector is entitled to that profit. Because the dealer, as the buyer, can resell and cover their loss, but if there's no loss, the seller isn't entitled to the gain.

Wait, the collector is suing the dealer. So perhaps the collector is claiming that the dealer had no right to resell the goods, and thus the dealer is liable for conversion or for the value of the goods.

Wait, another angle: when the dealer rejected the goods, the collector still owned them because the risk of loss was on the collector until delivery. Wait, no, F.O.B. destination (dealer's shop) means that the risk shifts to the dealer upon delivery. Wait, no, I think I was wrong earlier. Let me clarify F.O.B. terms.

F.O.B. destination means that the seller bears the risk until the goods reach the destination. So if the goods were damaged in transit to the dealer's shop (the destination), the risk would be on the collector (seller). So the goods were damaged, so the dealer can rightfully reject them because they're non-conforming.

So the dealer notifies the collector of rejection. The collector has the right to cure under UCC §2-508. The collector says he'll get back, but doesn't. So after a reasonable time, the dealer can treat the contract as avoided. Then, the dealer can resell the goods. The dealer sells them for $120k, which is higher than the contract price. So the dealer made a $20k profit.

But the collector is suing the dealer. So what is the collector's claim? Maybe the collector is arguing that the dealer didn't have the right to resell, so the dealer is liable for the value of the goods. Alternatively, perhaps the collector is trying to get the contract price, or the difference between contract and resale.

Wait, but the dealer, as the buyer, had the right to reject and resell. So if the dealer resells under UCC §2-706, the dealer can recover any loss. But in this case, the resale was higher, so the dealer didn't suffer a loss. Therefore, the dealer wouldn't owe the collector anything.

Alternatively, if the collector is suing for conversion, claiming that the dealer sold the tapestry without authority, then the collector could recover the value. But if the dealer had the right to resell under the UCC, then the dealer didn't convert the goods.

Wait, but after the dealer rejected the goods, ownership may still be with the collector. Because in F.O.B. destination, the risk is on the seller until delivery, but the title might pass upon shipment or upon delivery. I'm a bit hazy on when title passes. Under UCC, title typically passes when the seller completes their performance, which is upon delivery. So if it's F.O.B. destination, title passes upon delivery to the dealer. So the dealer would own the goods upon delivery, but they were damaged. So the dealer can reject them, and title would then revert to the collector. Or does it?

Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again. Under UCC §2-509, unless otherwise agreed, title passes from the seller to the buyer at the time and place the goods are received by the carrier for shipment to the buyer. So if it's F.O.B. destination, title would pass upon delivery. So when the goods arrive at the dealer's shop, title passes to the dealer, but the risk of loss remains with the seller until then. So if the goods are damaged in transit, the seller (collector) is liable because the risk was on them. But the dealer owns the goods upon delivery. So the dealer, as the owner, can choose to accept or reject them. If the dealer rejects, they can send them back, and the seller has the right to cure.

But in this case, the dealer rejected the goods, notified the collector, but the collector didn't respond. So after a reasonable time, the dealer can consider the contract avoided and resell the goods. Since the dealer owns the goods, they have the right to sell them. So when the dealer sold them for $120k, that's a higher price than the contract, so the dealer didn't suffer any loss.

So the collector is suing the dealer. What's the claim? The collector might argue that the dealer had no right to resell the goods, but under UCC, the dealer did have the right after the collector failed to cure. Alternatively, the collector might claim that the dealer's resale was improper, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, another angle: when the dealer sold the tapestry for $120k, which is higher than the contract price, perhaps the collector is entitled to the difference. But that doesn't make sense because the collector was the seller. If the dealer made a profit, that's the dealer's gain, not the collector's. The collector's loss would be limited to the contract price if the dealer defaulted, but here the collector was the one who didn't cure the defect.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. The situation is that the dealer rejected the goods, and the collector failed to cure. So the dealer, as the buyer, has the right to treat the contract as avoided and resell. Under UCC §2-708, the measure of damages when a buyer resells is the difference between market price and contract price, but if the resale is for a higher price, the seller (collector) doesn't have to pay anything because the buyer (dealer) didn't suffer a loss.

But the question is, the collector is suing the dealer. So maybe the issue is that the dealer sold the goods without authority, thus committing conversion, and the collector is entitled to the proceeds or the value.

But if the dealer had the right to resell under UCC §2-706, then the dealer didn't convert the goods. So the collector wouldn't be able to recover anything because the dealer acted lawfully.

Wait, but if the dealer resold the goods and made a profit, the collector might argue that the dealer's resale was unauthorized and thus the dealer is liable for the value. But I think that's not the case because the dealer followed the proper procedures under UCC.

Alternatively, perhaps the dealer's resale was a conversion because the collector still owned the goods. Wait, earlier I thought that under F.O.B. destination, title passes upon delivery, so the dealer owned the goods. So the dealer had the right to sell them, and thus no conversion.

So, if the dealer owned the goods, selling them wouldn't be conversion. Therefore, the collector can't recover anything from the dealer because the dealer was within their rights to resell. So the answer would be E: Nothing, because the dealer acted within his rights after the collector failed to respond.

Wait, but let me double-check. If the dealer had the right to resell under UCC §2-706, then the dealer can resell and recover any loss. But since the resale was for a higher price, the dealer didn't lose anything. So the dealer doesn't owe the collector anything. Therefore, the collector can't recover any damages from the dealer. So the answer should be E.

Looking at the options, option E says the collector recovers nothing because the dealer acted within his rights. That makes sense.

The collector contracted to sell a rare 16th-century tapestry to a dealer for $100,000, with delivery stipulated as "F.O.B. at the dealer's shop." This means the risk of loss shifted to the collector until the tapestry was delivered to the dealer's shop. The tapestry arrived damaged, and the dealer rejected it, notifying the collector. The collector promised to provide reshipping instructions but failed to respond. After four weeks, the dealer sold the tapestry to another buyer for $120,000. The collector is now suing the dealer for damages.

Under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), when goods are rejected due to non-conformance, the seller has the right to cure the defect within a reasonable time (UCC §2-508). If the seller fails to cure, the buyer can treat the contract as avoided and resell the goods under UCC §2-706. In this case, the collector failed to respond or cure the defect, so the dealer, after a reasonable time, was entitled to resell the tapestry.

The resale price of $120,000 was higher than the contract price of $100,000, meaning the dealer did not suffer any loss. Under UCC §2-708, the seller is only liable for the buyer's losses, not for any profits the buyer makes on resale. Since the dealer acted within their rights by reselling the tapestry after the collector failed to cure the defect, the collector is not entitled to recover any damages.

Thus, the collector should recover nothing because the dealer acted lawfully under the UCC.
