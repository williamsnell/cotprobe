Question:

A 45-year-old man comes to the physician because of right shoulder pain that began after he chopped wood 2 days ago. Examination of the right upper extremity shows no obvious bone deformities or point tenderness. The pain is reproduced when the patient is asked to externally rotate the shoulder against resistance; there is no weakness. In addition to the teres minor, inflammation of which of the following tendons is most likely in this patient?

Options:

A: Deltoid
B: Infraspinatus
C: Supraspinatus
D: Triceps Brachii
E: Subscapularis
F: Coracobrachialis
G: Teres Major
H: Pectoralis
I: Brachialis
J: Biceps Brachii

Okay, so I've got this question about shoulder pain, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by reading it carefully.

The patient is a 45-year-old man who started having right shoulder pain after chopping wood two days ago. On examination, there's no obvious deformity or point tenderness. The pain happens when he externally rotates the shoulder against resistance, and there's no weakness. The question is asking which tendon is inflamed, in addition to the teres minor.

Hmm, right. So I remember that the rotator cuff is made up of four muscles: supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis. Each of these muscles has tendons that can get inflamed, leading to different kinds of shoulder pain.

When the patient has pain upon external rotation against resistance, I should think about which muscles are responsible for that movement. External rotation of the shoulder is mainly done by the infraspinatus and teres minor muscles. The supraspinatus is more involved in abduction, and the subscapularis in internal rotation.

Wait, the question says that the teres minor is already inflamed, as it's mentioned in the question. So the other tendon involved must be another one related to external rotation. That would be the infraspinatus.

So the patient's symptoms point towards inflammation of both the teres minor and infraspinatus tendons. The infraspinatus tendon would be the answer here.

Looking at the options, let's see:

A: Deltoid – that's for shoulder abduction, not really external rotation.

B: Infraspinatus – yes, that's one of the external rotators.

C: Supraspinatus – more for the first part of abduction.

D: Triceps Brachii – that's for elbow extension.

E: Subscapularis – internal rotation.

So the correct answer would be B: Infraspinatus.

The patient is a 45-year-old man with right shoulder pain after chopping wood, exacerbated by external rotation against resistance. The rotator cuff includes the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis. External rotation is primarily performed by the infraspinatus and teres minor. Since the teres minor is already implicated, the infraspinatus is the most likely additional tendon involved. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Deltoid** – involved in abduction, not external rotation.  
- **B: Infraspinatus** – a key external rotator, fits the symptoms.  
- **C: Supraspinatus** – primarily for abduction.  
- **D: Triceps Brachii** – involved in elbow extension.  
- **E: Subscapularis** – involved in internal rotation.  

The correct answer is **B: Infraspinatus**.
