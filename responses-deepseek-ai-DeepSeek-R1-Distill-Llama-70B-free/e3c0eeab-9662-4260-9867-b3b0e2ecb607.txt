The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
You are the United States,
you are the future invader
of the native America that has Indian blood,
that still prays to Jesus Christ and still speaks Spanish.
. . .
you are Alexander-Nebuchadnezzar.
You think that life is fire,
that progress is eruption,
that wherever you shoot
you hit the future.
No.
. . .
But our America, that has had poets
since the ancient times of Netzahualcoyotl,
. . .
that consulted the stars, that knew Atlantis
whose resounding name comes to us from Plato,
that since the remote times of its life
has lived on light, on fire, on perfume, on love,
America of the great Montezuma, of the Inca,
the fragrant America of Christopher Columbus,
Catholic America, Spanish America,
the America in which noble Cuauhtémoc said:
"I'm not in a bed of roses", that America
that trembles in hurricanes and lives on love,
it lives, you men of Saxon eyes and barbarous soul.
And it dreams. And it loves, and it vibrates, and it is the daughter of the sun.
Be careful. Viva Spanish America!
There are a thousand cubs loosed from the Spanish lion.
Roosevelt, one would have to be, through God himself,
the-fearful rifleman and strong hunter,
to manage to grab us in your iron claws.
And, although you count on everything, you lack one thing: God!

Okay, so I've got this question here about a poem by Rubén Darío called "To Roosevelt," written in 1904. The question is asking what events might have prompted the poet to write this piece. The options are from A to H, each referring to a different historical event involving the United States.

First, I need to understand the poem's context. From what I remember, Darío was a Nicaraguan poet, and he's known for his work in the Modernismo movement. His poetry often dealt with themes of identity, especially in the face of foreign influence, particularly from the United States.

Looking at the poem, it seems to be addressing Roosevelt, who I think was Theodore Roosevelt, the U.S. President at the time. The poem talks about the U.S. as an invader, referring to its expansion into Native America and the influence over Spanish-speaking countries. It mentions "thousand cubs loosed from the Spanish lion," which I think refers to the many Latin American countries that were once Spanish colonies but are now independent. The poem also warns that despite the U.S.'s power, they lack God's support, implying a moral or spiritual deficiency.

So, the poem is likely a response to U.S. interventionism in Latin America during that period. Now, considering the events listed in the options:

Option A: U.S. involvement in the Haitian Revolution. The Haitian Revolution ended in 1804, so that's way before 1904. So probably not this one.

Option B: U.S. involvement in Panama’s independence. Panama declared independence from Colombia in 1903, and the U.S. supported this because they wanted to build the Panama Canal. This seems close in time to the poem, written in 1904.

Option C: The U.S. involvement in the Mexican Revolution. The Mexican Revolution started in 1910, so after the poem was written. So this isn't it.

Option D: The embargo of Cuba after Castro’s revolution. Castro's revolution was in the late 1950s, way after 1904. Not relevant here.

Option E: The annexation of Texas by the U.S. That happened in 1845, leading to the Mexican-American War. Again, too early.

Option F: The establishment of the Monroe Doctrine. That was in 1823, where the U.S. stated it would oppose European colonization in the Americas. While it's part of U.S. policy in Latin America, the poem is from 1904, so maybe it's more about the active interventions of the time rather than the doctrine itself.

Option G: The discovery of the Zimmerman Telegram. That happened in 1917 during World War I, so after the poem.

Option H: The Louisiana Purchase. That was in 1803, so way too early.

So, the most likely event is Option B: U.S. involvement in Panama’s independence. The U.S. supported Panama's secession from Colombia to build the Panama Canal, which was a significant intervention in Latin America around 1903-1904. This would have been a major event prompting Darío to write the poem as a critique of U.S. imperialism.

Wait, but I also recall that the poem was written in response to the U.S.'s growing influence and interventionism, especially under Roosevelt's "big stick" diplomacy. The construction of the Panama Canal was a big part of that, and the U.S. involvement in Panama's affairs would have been a direct provocation. So yeah, Option B makes sense.

Another thought: the poem mentions "you are the future invader of the native America," which could refer to the U.S.'s expansionist policies. The Panama Canal project was a key part of that, so the U.S. taking control of the Canal Zone would fit as a prompt for this poem.

The poem "To Roosevelt" by Rubén Darío, written in 1904, critiques U.S. interventionism in Latin America, particularly under Theodore Roosevelt's presidency. The poem addresses themes of U.S. expansion and imperialism, warning against the moral and spiritual implications of such actions. Among the historical events listed, the U.S. involvement in Panama’s independence in 1903 aligns most closely with the poem's context. This event, where the U.S. supported Panama's secession from Colombia to facilitate the construction of the Panama Canal, exemplifies the U.S.'s "big stick" diplomacy and interventionist policies in the region. These actions would have prompted Darío to write the poem as a response to U.S. imperialism.
