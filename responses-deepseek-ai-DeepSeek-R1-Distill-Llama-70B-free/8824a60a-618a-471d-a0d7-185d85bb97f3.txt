Question:

A plaintiff sued a defendant for injuries that the plaintiff suffered when he was struck by the defendant's car. At trial, the plaintiff testified that he was walking across the street inside a crosswalk at the time the defendant's car hit him. This action takes place in a jurisdiction that has a statute in effect requiring all motorists to stop and permit pedestrians to cross streets at designated crosswalks. The defendant contended that the plaintiff ran into the street outside the crosswalk. Furthermore, the defendant testified that he immediately applied his brakes when he saw the plaintiff dart into the street, but couldn't stop his car in time to avoid hitting him. In support of the defendant's testimony, the defendant calls a neighbor to testify that she has observed the plaintiff frequently during the years that she has lived on that street, and that the plaintiff "always crosses the street outside the crosswalk. "The neighbor's testimony is likely to be

Options:

A: admitted, because it tends to show that the plaintiff was careless.
B: excluded, because it is based on the neighbor's personal opinion.
C: admitted, because it supports the defendant's version of events.
D: excluded, because her testimony is impermissible evidence of character to show defendant's plaintiff's conduct on a particular occasion.
E: admitted, because it challenges the plaintiff's credibility.
F: excluded, because the neighbor's testimony is hearsay.
G: admitted, because it is probative of the plaintiff's habit of crossing the street outside the crosswalk.
H: excluded, because it is irrelevant to the specific incident.
I: admitted, because it provides context to the plaintiff's behavior.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically dealing with the admissibility of testimony. Let's try to break this down step by step. 

The scenario is a trial where the plaintiff was hit by the defendant's car. The plaintiff says he was in the crosswalk, which is important because there's a statute requiring motorists to stop for pedestrians in crosswalks. The defendant claims the plaintiff ran into the street outside the crosswalk and that he couldn't stop in time. 

Now, the defendant calls a neighbor who testifies that she's seen the plaintiff frequently over the years and that he "always crosses the street outside the crosswalk." The question is about whether this testimony is admissible.

Hmm, I remember that evidence about a person's character is generally not admissible to prove they acted in a certain way on a specific occasion. But wait, there's an exception for habit, right? Habit is different from character. Habit refers to a person's regular and specific response to a particular situation, done with some frequency.

So, the neighbor's testimony is about the plaintiff's habit of crossing outside the crosswalk. That sounds like it's habit evidence, which is admissible under FRE 406. Habit is considered relevant because it shows a tendency to act in a certain way under certain conditions. 

Wait, but I should make sure. The options provided include various possibilities. Let me look at the options again:

Option A says it's admitted because it shows the plaintiff was careless. But carelessness is about character or negligence, which might not be the right approach here.

Option B says it's excluded because it's the neighbor's opinion. But the testimony is about what the neighbor observed, not just an opinion, so B might not be correct.

Option C says admitted because it supports the defendant's version. That's true, but the reason must be legally sound.

Option D says excluded because it's character evidence. Oh, right, but if it's habit, it's allowed. So D might not be correct because it's about conduct on a particular occasion, and habit is an exception.

Option E says admitted because it challenges credibility. I don't think that's the right reason. The testimony is about the plaintiff's behavior, not directly about his credibility as a witness.

Option F says excluded as hearsay. The neighbor is testifying to what she observed, so it's not hearsay. She's recounting her own perceptions, not someone else's statement. So F is incorrect.

Option G says admitted because it's probative of the plaintiff's habit. That sounds exactly right. FRE 406 allows evidence of habit to show conduct on a particular occasion.

Option H says excluded because irrelevant. But the plaintiff's habit is relevant to whether he was in the crosswalk on this occasion. So H is probably wrong.

Option I says admitted because it provides context. While that's true, the specific legal reason is about habit, so I might not be the best choice.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be G because the testimony is about the plaintiff's habit, which is admissible under the habit exception.

The question revolves around the admissibility of a neighbor's testimony regarding the plaintiff's habit of crossing the street outside the crosswalk. The plaintiff alleges he was hit while in a crosswalk, while the defendant claims the plaintiff darted into the street outside the crosswalk. The neighbor's testimony is offered to support the defendant's version of events.

Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, character evidence is generally inadmissible to prove conduct on a specific occasion. However, habit evidence is an exception. Habit refers to a person's regular and specific response to a particular situation, and it is admissible under FRE 406 to show conduct on a particular occasion. The neighbor's testimony about the plaintiff's consistent behavior of crossing outside the crosswalk fits the definition of habit evidence. It is relevant and probative to the specific incident in question, making it admissible.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The testimony is not about carelessness but about habit.
- **B**: Incorrect. The testimony is based on observation, not opinion.
- **C**: Incorrect. While it supports the defendant's version, the legal basis is habit, not just support.
- **D**: Incorrect. Habit is an exception to the character evidence rule, so it is admissible.
- **E**: Incorrect. The testimony does not directly challenge the plaintiff's credibility.
- **F**: Incorrect. The testimony is not hearsay; it is based on personal observation.
- **G**: Correct. The testimony is admissible as habit evidence under FRE 406.
- **H**: Incorrect. The testimony is relevant to the specific incident.
- **I**: Incorrect. While it provides context, the specific legal reason is habit.

The best answer is **G**.

Answer: G
