Okay, so I have this question about how we first accurately measured the diameter of Pluto. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

The question gives a bunch of options, from A to J. I remember that measuring the size of objects in space can be tricky. For something as far away as Pluto, it's probably not easy. I've heard about the New Horizons mission, which I think was a flyby. Oh wait, New Horizons flew by Pluto in 2015, right? So that's option I, but that's in the 2010s, not the 1990s. Oh wait, the options say I is a New Horizons flyby in the 1990s. That must be a typo because I'm pretty sure New Horizons was launched later. So maybe that's not the right answer.

Wait, another thought. Before New Horizons, how did we measure Pluto's size? I remember something about mutual eclipses between Pluto and its moon Charon. Because when they pass in front of each other from our perspective, we can measure the brightness changes. So when one blocks the other, the total brightness drops. By observing these events, astronomers can figure out the sizes relative to each other. So that might be option D: brightness measurements during mutual eclipses of Pluto and Charon. That sounds familiar.

But I also recall that before these eclipses, we couldn't get an accurate measurement. So when did these eclipses happen? I think the mutual events of Pluto and Charon occurred in the late 1980s to early 1990s. So by observing these, they could determine the sizes more accurately. That would make option D the correct answer.

Wait, but what about other options? Like option H: Hubble images. I'm not sure if Hubble could resolve Pluto's disk. I think Hubble has high resolution, but Pluto is so small and far away. Maybe it wasn't sufficient to get an accurate diameter. So maybe Hubble couldn't resolve it well enough until later, or perhaps not at all. Or maybe it did, but I'm not certain.

Option F is radar observations from Arecibo. Radar can measure distances and maybe sizes, but I'm not sure if that was used for Pluto's diameter. I think radar is more for asteroids or closer objects.

Option B is Voyager 2, but Voyager 2 went to the outer planets, but I don't think it went anywhere near Pluto. It went past Neptune in 1989, so that's probably too far from Pluto. So that wouldn't help measure Pluto's size.

Option A is Apollo missions. Those were on the Moon, and I don't think they were used for Pluto observations. Plus, Apollo was in the late 60s and early 70s, which is probably before the mutual eclipses.

Option E is Mars Rover's telescope. That doesn't make much sense. Mars Rovers are on Mars, and their telescopes aren't powerful enough for that, I think.

Options C, G, and J are other space telescopes. Chandra is X-ray, and Pluto isn't a strong X-ray source. Spitzer is infrared, same issue. Kepler was for exoplanets, not really for measuring sizes of distant dwarf planets.

So putting it together, the most plausible answer is D: brightness measurements during mutual eclipses. That would have allowed astronomers to calculate the sizes based on how much light was blocked during these events.

The accurate measurement of Pluto's diameter was first achieved through brightness measurements made during mutual eclipses of Pluto and Charon. These events, which occurred in the late 1980s to early 1990s, allowed astronomers to determine the sizes of Pluto and its moon by observing changes in brightness as they passed in front of each other. 

Other options, such as the New Horizons flyby (option I), occurred later in 2015, not in the 1990s as stated. Hubble Space Telescope images (option H) likely did not resolve Pluto's disk with sufficient accuracy at the time. Voyager 2 (option B) did not approach Pluto, and radar observations from Arecibo (option F) were not used for this purpose. Other space telescopes like Chandra, Spitzer, and Kepler (options C, G, J) were not suited for measuring Pluto's size. Apollo missions (option A) and Mars Rover observations (option E) were unrelated to Pluto's diameter measurement.

Thus, the correct answer is based on the mutual eclipses providing the necessary data to accurately determine Pluto's size.

Answer: D
