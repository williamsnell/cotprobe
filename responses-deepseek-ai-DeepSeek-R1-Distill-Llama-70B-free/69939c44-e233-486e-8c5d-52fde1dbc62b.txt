Okay, let's try to figure out the answer to this question. So, the question is about a letter from a Jewish trader in India to his wife in Cairo around the year 1200. The letter talks about the possibility of divorce because the waiting has been long. The husband says he can't come home with nothing, implying he might need more time or success before returning. He's giving his wife the option to end the marriage with a bill of repudiation.

Alright, the question is asking what's the most probable cause of the marital strain. The options are A through J. I need to read each option carefully and see which one fits the situation described.

Looking at the letter, the main points are the long waiting period, the husband being away, and the possibility that he can't return yet. He's giving his wife the choice to divorce, which suggests that the separation is causing problems.

Option A says the merchant is involved in illegal activities. The letter doesn't mention anything about that, so I don't think A is correct.

Option B is bankruptcy. The letter says he can't come home with nothing, which might imply financial issues, but it's not explicitly stated. He might just be waiting for success or more resources before returning, not necessarily bankrupt.

Option C is a decision to stay permanently. The letter doesn't say he wants to stay forever; he mentions waiting and possibly taking time, so maybe he's just delayed, not permanent.

Option D is social pressures from the new community. There's no indication in the letter about social pressures or issues with the community in India.

Option E suggests the merchant is unwilling to return. The letter seems more about him being unable to return yet, not that he doesn't want to. He says he can't come home with nothing, implying he's waiting for the right circumstances.

Option F is about the strain from long periods of separation. That makes sense because the letter talks about the long waiting period, which would naturally cause marital strain.

Option G is the wife's inability to join him. The letter doesn't mention her moving; he's the one away from home.

Option H is a change of profession. There's nothing in the letter about his job changing, so H doesn't seem right.

Option I is disputes over finances. While finances might be a part of it since he can't come home empty-handed, the main issue seems to be the separation itself.

Option J is religious disagreements from exposure to Hinduism. The letter is from a Jewish trader, and there's no mention of religious issues.

So, putting it all together, the main issue seems to be the long separation causing strain. The husband is away for a long time, and that's causing the marital problems. So the most probable cause is F: the strain placed on merchant families by long periods of separation.

The marital strain evident in the letter stems from the prolonged separation between the merchant and his wife. The letter highlights the husband's inability to return home immediately, likely due to waiting for circumstances to improve, which suggests that the extended time apart is the primary cause of the strain. Among the options provided, the most fitting explanation is the strain caused by long periods of separation.

Answer: F
