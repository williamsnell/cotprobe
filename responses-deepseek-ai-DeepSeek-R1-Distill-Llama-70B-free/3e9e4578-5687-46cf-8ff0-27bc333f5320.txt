Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it says. Ken and Tami are making necklaces. Ken makes 25 necklaces. Tami makes m more necklaces than Ken. The question is asking which expression represents the total number of necklaces they made together.

Hmm, right. So I think the first step is to break down what each person made and then add them together. Let's start with Ken. He made 25 necklaces. That's straightforward.

Now, Tami makes m more than Ken. So if Ken made 25, then Tami must have made 25 plus m. Because m is the extra number she made beyond what Ken did. So Tami's necklaces would be 25 + m.

Wait, but wait a second. The problem says Tami makes m more necklaces than Ken. So if Ken made 25, Tami made 25 + m. That makes sense. So the total would be the sum of Ken's and Tami's.

So the total number of necklaces is Ken's 25 plus Tami's (25 + m). So putting that together: 25 + (25 + m). Let me compute that. 25 +25 is 50, plus m, so 50 + m. Wait, but that's not one of the options as the expression. The options are given as expressions, not simplified numbers.

Looking at the options, option A is 25 + (25 + m). That's exactly what I just wrote. So that's one possibility.

Wait, but let me make sure. Another way to approach this is to think about Tami's necklaces as (Ken's number + m). So Tami = 25 + m. Then total is Ken + Tami, which is 25 + (25 + m). That's the same as option A.

But let me check if any other options could be correct. Option E is 25 + 25m. That would be if Tami made m times 25 necklaces, but that doesn't fit because the problem says she makes m more, not m times more. So E isn't right.

Option B is 25 + m. That would be if Tami made m necklaces, but the problem states she made m more than Ken, so B is incorrect.

Option C is m + 25m, which is 26m. That's way off because that's combining their counts in a multiplied way, which doesn't make sense here.

Option D is 25m +25. That would mean (25* m) plus 25, which again doesn't fit because Tami's count isn't 25m.

Option F: 25m. That's just 25 times m, which isn't right either.

Option G: 25m - m =24m. No, that doesn't make sense in this context.

Option H: 2*(25 +m). That would be doubling the sum of 25 and m. But that would be if both Ken and Tami made 25 + m each, which isn't the case. Because Ken only made 25, and Tami made 25 + m. So H is incorrect.

Option I:50 + m. Wait, that's what I got when I simplified 25 + (25 + m). So 50 + m is the total. But looking at the options, option I is 50 + m. So why is that not the answer? Because the question is asking for an expression that represents the total. So if I have 25 + (25 + m), that's the same as 50 + m, which would match option I. But wait, the options are given as expressions, so perhaps both A and I are equivalent. But looking at the options, A is 25 + (25 +m), which is exactly the expression before simplifying, whereas I is the simplified version.

But the question says, which expression represents the total. So both A and I are correct in meaning, but perhaps the question expects the unsimplified version. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, let me read again. The question asks for the total number of necklaces made by both Ken and Tami. So Ken made 25, Tami made m more than Ken, which is 25 + m. So total is 25 + (25 + m) = 50 + m. So 50 + m is the total, which would be option I.

Wait, but earlier I thought option A was correct. So I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait no, perhaps not. Let me clarify. The total necklaces = Ken's necklaces + Tami's necklaces. Ken's is 25, Tami's is 25 + m. So total is 25 + (25 + m). That's option A.

But 25 + (25 + m) simplifies to 50 + m, which is option I. So both A and I are correct mathematically, but perhaps the question expects the expression before simplification.

Looking back at the options, option A is 25 + (25 + m), which directly represents Ken's 25 plus Tami's (25 + m). Option I is 50 + m, which is the simplified form.

So the question is about which expression represents the total. Both are correct, but perhaps the answer expects the combined expression without simplifying the constants. So option A would be the correct choice because it directly adds Ken's 25 and Tami's 25 + m.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option E is 25 + 25m, which would be if Tami made 25 times m necklaces, which isn't the case here. So that's not it.

So I'm now torn between options A and I. But the problem says "expression represents the total." So in terms of expressions, both are correct. But perhaps the problem expects the expression that directly represents the sum of Ken's and Tami's necklaces without simplifying.

Wait another thought: the problem says Tami makes m more necklaces than Ken. So Tami's count is 25 + m. So total is 25 + (25 + m) = 50 + m. So 50 + m is the total, which is option I.

But earlier I thought option A is correct because it's the expression before simplification. Now I'm getting conflicting thoughts.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me model it with numbers to check.

Suppose m = 5. So Tami makes 5 more than Ken. Ken made 25, so Tami made 30. Total is 25 +30 =55.

Now, let's plug m=5 into each option.

Option A: 25 + (25 +5)=25+30=55. Correct.

Option I:50 +5=55. Also correct.

So both options would give 55 when m=5. So both are correct. But how is that possible?

Wait, perhaps the question is looking for the expression in terms of m, not the simplified number. So 25 + (25 +m) is the expression, which is option A. Alternatively, 50 + m is option I.

Wait, but the problem says "the total number of necklaces Ken and Tami made." So in terms of expressions, both A and I are correct. So how can both be correct? That can't be. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement, it says "Tami makes m more necklaces than Ken." So Tami's necklaces are 25 + m.

So total is Ken's (25) plus Tami's (25 + m), which is 25 +25 +m =50 +m. So that's the total. So the expression is 50 +m, which is option I.

But why is option A present? Because it's 25 + (25 +m), which is the same as 50 +m.

So the answer could be either A or I, but looking at the options, both are present. So perhaps the intended correct answer is A because it explicitly represents both Ken's and Tami's contributions.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E, but no, E is 25 +25m, which would be if Tami made 25 times m, which isn't the case.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The initial expression is 25 (Ken) plus (25 +m) (Tami), so that would be 25 +25 +m, which is 50 +m. So the correct expression is 50 +m, which is option I.

But another angle: the question gives options, so perhaps the answer is A. Because it's the direct sum without combining like terms. So the correct answer is A.

Wait, but I'm getting confused because both A and I give the same numerical result. But the problem is about the expression, not the numerical value. So the expression is 25 + (25 +m), which is option A.

So after thinking, I think the correct answer is option A.

To determine the total number of necklaces Ken and Tami made, we start by noting that Ken made 25 necklaces. Tami made \( m \) more necklaces than Ken, so Tami made \( 25 + m \) necklaces. The total number of necklaces is the sum of Ken's and Tami's necklaces:

\[
\text{Total} = 25 + (25 + m)
\]

This expression directly represents the total number of necklaces without simplifying the constants. While simplifying \( 25 + (25 + m) \) gives \( 50 + m \), the problem asks for the expression that represents the total, not necessarily the simplified form. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: \( 25 + (25 + m) \)**

This option explicitly accounts for Ken's 25 necklaces and Tami's \( 25 + m \) necklaces, making it the most direct representation of the total.
