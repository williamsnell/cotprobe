Okay, so I'm trying to solve this Bertrand model problem. Hmm, I remember that the Bertrand model is about firms competing on price rather than quantity. Right, so in this setup, both firms have zero production costs, which simplifies things a bit.

The demand curve is given by Q = 150 - P. Wait, I think Q here represents the total quantity demanded in the market. Since there are two identical firms, each firm's quantity would depend on their price relative to the other's.

So the firms choose prices simultaneously. In a Nash equilibrium, each firm's price is the best response to the other's price. But wait, in the Bertrand model, if both firms set the same price, then they split the market. But since they're choosing prices, each will try to undercut the other to capture more market share.

Wait, but without any costs, if one firm sets a slightly lower price, it will capture the entire market because consumers prefer the cheaper option. So each firm has an incentive to lower the price to capture the whole demand.

But wait, if both set the same price, each gets half the quantity. So the Nash equilibrium occurs when both set a price that neither wants to change unilaterally.

Let me think about the reaction functions. Each firm's best response is to undercut the other's price. But if both are doing this, where does it end? Oh, right, in the Bertrand model with homogeneous products and zero costs, the Nash equilibrium price ends up being zero. Because each firm can always undercut the other's price until the price reaches the marginal cost, which here is zero.

Wait, but let me think again. If both firms set P=0, then each would get Q=150, but since there are two firms, each would get half. But wait, the demand is Q=150 - P, so if P is zero, Q would be 150. So each firm would get Q=75. But since their marginal cost is zero, their profit is zero as well because price is zero. Hmm, that doesn't seem right for profits, but in this model, it's about the equilibrium.

Wait, but when firms set their prices, if one sets a higher price, the other can capture the entire market by setting a lower price. So the only stable point is when both set P=0, because any higher price would allow the other to undercut and take the whole market.

So in this case, the Nash equilibrium price should be zero. Looking at the options, option C is zero. So I think the answer is C.

In the Bertrand model, firms compete by setting prices simultaneously, and consumers choose the cheaper product. With two firms offering identical products and no production costs, the demand curve is given by \( Q = 150 - P \). Each firm's goal is to maximize its profit, which depends on its price relative to the competitor's price.

In this scenario, if one firm sets a higher price, the other firm can undercut it and capture the entire market. This creates an incentive for both firms to lower their prices until neither firm can benefit from further price reductions. Since the marginal cost of production is zero, the only stable Nash equilibrium occurs when both firms set their prices at zero. At this point, neither firm can increase its profit by unilaterally changing its price.

Thus, the Nash equilibrium price in this Bertrand competition is \( P = 0 \).
