Question:

A drama guild is renovating an old theater, hoping to use it for 15 years. The guild can follow one of two plans to finance the work: Plan A is to use $5,000 collected from guild members to pay for a renovation job which would be done immediately and would last 15 years. Plan B is to borrow $2,000 the year before the theater opens, and then in the 5th and 10th years of the theater's life to renovate it; each job will last five years. Interest is 6% for both plans. (a) Which plan should the guild follow? (b) If, in Plan B, the 2nd and 3rd renovation jobs will cost $3,000 each and the guild will not be able to borrow the money for any of the three jobs (i.e., the members will have to contribute), which plan should the guild follow?

Options:

A: Plan A, with the $5,000 invested first to grow at 6% interest before renovating
B: Plan B, with renovations every 7 years and borrowing at a lower interest rate
C: Plan A
D: Plan B, with the guild members contributing an additional $1,000 upfront for future renovations
E: Plan A, but with an additional loan taken out in the 10th year
F: Plan A, with a smaller renovation every 5 years using money from fundraising events
G: Plan B
H: Both plans
I: Plan B, with additional renovations every 3 years financed by ticket sales
J: Neither plans

Okay, so I've got this drama guild question about financing renovations for a theater. They have two plans, A and B, and I need to figure out which one is better. Let's see, I'm a bit rusty on my finance, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I'll try to understand each plan. 

Plan A: They use $5,000 collected from members right now to pay for a renovation that will last 15 years. So it's a one-time upfront payment.

Plan B: They borrow $2,000 the year before the theater opens. Then in the 5th and 10th years, they renovate again, each time borrowing another $2,000. Each renovation lasts five years. Wait, no, the first part says borrow $2,000 the year before, and then in 5th and 10th years. Oh wait, the initial description says Plan B is to borrow $2,000 the year before the theater opens, and then in the 5th and 10th years. So that's three renovations: at year 0 (before opening), year 5, and year 10. Each renovation is $2,000. But wait, the question says for part (a), each job will cost $2,000. Oh wait, no—the initial Plan B says: borrow $2,000 the year before, then in the 5th and 10th years, renovate again. So three renovations, each costing $2,000. But wait, no—wait, the question says "each job will last five years." Oh, so each renovation lasts five years. So the theater's life is 15 years, so they do a renovation every five years.

But wait, the way it's worded: Plan B is to borrow $2,000 the year before the theater opens (so year -1?), and then in the 5th and 10th years. So that's three renovations: the first at year -1, then 5, then 10. Each renovation is $2,000. Each lasts five years. So the first renovation (year -1) would last until year 4, then the second starts at year 5, lasts until 9, and the third at 10, lasts until 14. Then what about year 15? Oh, the theater is used for 15 years, so maybe the last renovation covers up to 15? Or maybe they don't need another one because the theater's life ends at 15.

Wait, the problem says the theater is used for 15 years, so the first renovation (at year -1) lasts until year 4, the second (year 5) until 9, the third (year 10) until 14. So year 15 is the last year, but the third renovation only covers up to 14. Hmm. So maybe after 14, they don't need another renovation because the theater is only used until 15, so that's okay.

Now, the question is about which plan is better financially, considering interest is 6% for both plans. So I guess I need to calculate the present value or the future value of each plan to compare them.

Wait, but the question is part (a) and part (b). Let's focus on part (a) first.

So for part (a), in Plan B, each renovation costs $2,000. The guild can borrow the money each time. So they're not using member contributions except for Plan A's initial $5,000.

Wait, no—Plan A uses $5,000 from members now. Plan B borrows $2,000 three times: at year -1, 5, and 10. So they're taking loans each time, and presumably paying them back with interest. But wait, the problem doesn't specify the terms of the loans beyond the interest rate. Hmm, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the question is simply looking at the present value of the costs under each plan.

Alternatively, maybe it's an investment problem where the guild is choosing to spend money now or later, and we need to compare the total cost considering the time value of money.

So let's model this. For Plan A, the cost is $5,000 at time zero (now). For Plan B, they have three expenditures: at time -1, 5, and 10, each of $2,000. But wait, time -1 is one year before now, so it's like a payment made a year ago. How do we handle that in present value terms?

Alternatively, maybe the payments are at time 0 (now), 5, and 10, each $2,000. Wait, the question says "the year before the theater opens", which would be before the theater starts being used. Let's assume that the theater opens at time 0, so the first renovation is at time -1 (a year before opening). Then the next at time 5, then time 10.

But to compute the present value (at time 0), we need to discount each of these cash flows.

Wait, the interest rate is 6%, so I'll use that to discount.

For Plan A: cost is $5,000 at time 0. So present value is $5,000.

Plan B: Three payments: $2,000 at time -1, $2,000 at 5, and $2,000 at 10.

Wait, time -1 is one year before now. So the present value of a payment at time -1 would actually be higher than its face value because it's a past payment. But that doesn't make much sense in this context because you can't really have a negative time in present value calculations when everything is relative to now.

Alternatively, maybe the first renovation is at time 0, then 5, then 10. But the question says "the year before the theater opens", implying that the first renovation occurs before the theater is operational, so perhaps at time -1 relative to the 15-year period.

Wait, perhaps the theater's 15-year life starts at year 0. So the renovation happens at year -1, 5, and 10. So the first renovation is right before the theater opens, then every five years.

So to find the present value at time 0 for Plan B:

- The first payment is at time -1: so to find its present value at time 0, we need to compound it. Because time -1 is one year before time 0. So $2,000 at time -1 would be worth $2,000 * (1 + 0.06)^1 at time 0. Because from time -1 to 0 is one year.

Similarly, the payments at time 5 and 10 would be discounted to present value at time 0.

So the present value (PV) for Plan B would be:

PV = 2000*(1.06)^1 + 2000/(1.06)^5 + 2000/(1.06)^10

Wait, no. Wait, the first term is at time -1. So when we're calculating the present value at time 0, the first payment is at time -1. So the present value of that payment as of time 0 would actually be higher than $2,000. Because it's a past payment, so its present value at time 0 is the future value from time -1 to 0.

So the formula is: PV = 2000 * (1 + 0.06)^1 + 2000/(1.06)^5 + 2000/(1.06)^10

Let me compute each term:

First term: 2000 * 1.06 = 2120.

Second term: 2000 / (1.06)^5. Let me compute (1.06)^5. 1.06^1=1.06, ^2=1.1236, ^3≈1.1910, ^4≈1.2625, ^5≈1.3382. So 2000 / 1.3382 ≈ 2000 / 1.3382 ≈ 1495.23.

Third term: 2000 / (1.06)^10. 1.06^10 is approximately 1.7908. So 2000 / 1.7908 ≈ 1116.99.

Adding them up: 2120 + 1495.23 + 1116.99 ≈ 2120 + 1495 is 3615, plus 1117 is about 4732.

So the present value of Plan B is approximately $4,732, while Plan A is $5,000. So Plan B is cheaper in terms of present value, so the guild should choose Plan B for part (a).

Wait, but wait. The question says the guild can follow one of the two plans. So in Plan A, they pay $5,000 now. In Plan B, they pay $2,000 at time -1, 5, and 10. So the total present value for Plan B is about $4,732, which is less than $5,000. So Plan B is better because it costs less in present value terms.

Wait, but does that make sense? Because Plan B requires three separate renovations, each costing $2,000. But when you factor in the time value of money, the later payments are worth less. Wait, but the first payment is at time -1, which is before now, so it's actually more expensive in present terms. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, no, time -1 is one year before time 0, so the present value at time 0 of a payment at time -1 is that payment multiplied by (1 + r). So yes, that's correct. So the first payment is more costly than if it were made at time 0.

Wait, but that's a bit confusing. Let me think again. If the renovation happens at time -1, the guild borrows $2,000 at that time. So from the guild's perspective at time 0, that $2,000 was spent a year ago. But in terms of present value, to compare the two plans, we have to bring all payments to the same point in time, which is time 0.

So the $2,000 spent at time -1 would have grown to $2,000 * 1.06 by time 0. So when considering the present value of Plan B, that first payment adds $2,120 at time 0.

Then, the payment at time 5 is $2,000, which in present value terms is $2,000 / (1.06)^5 ≈ $1,495.23.

Similarly, the payment at time 10 is $2,000 / (1.06)^10 ≈ $1,116.99.

So total PV for Plan B is approximately 2,120 + 1,495.23 + 1,116.99 ≈ $4,732.22.

Plan A is a flat $5,000 at time 0.

So Plan B's total present cost is lower than Plan A's. Therefore, the guild should choose Plan B for part (a).

Now, moving on to part (b). In Plan B, the 2nd and 3rd renovation jobs will cost $3,000 each, and the guild cannot borrow the money—so members have to contribute. So in Plan B, the first renovation is $2,000 (borrowed), but the second and third are $3,000 each, which members have to pay from their own funds.

So now, the costs are: first renovation at time -1: $2,000 (borrowed). Second at time 5: $3,000 (members' contribution). Third at time 10: $3,000 (members' contribution).

So the present value of Plan B now is:

PV = 2000*(1.06) + 3000/(1.06)^5 + 3000/(1.06)^10.

Calculating each term:

First term: 2000 * 1.06 = 2120.

Second term: 3000 / (1.06)^5. We know (1.06)^5 ≈1.3382, so 3000 /1.3382 ≈ 2242.35.

Third term: 3000 / (1.06)^10 ≈3000 /1.7908 ≈1674.99.

Adding them up: 2120 + 2242.35 = 4362.35 + 1674.99 ≈6037.34.

So the present value of Plan B in part (b) is approximately $6,037.34.

Compare this to Plan A, which is $5,000.

So Plan B now costs more in present value than Plan A. So the guild should choose Plan A in part (b).

Looking back at the options, the question asks for (a) and (b), but the options provided are individual choices. Wait, the options are for each part? Wait, the question is given as a multiple-choice question with options A through J. Each option is a statement, and the answer is the correct letter.

Looking back, the options are:

A: Plan A, with the $5,000 invested first to grow at 6% interest before renovating

B: Plan B, with renovations every 7 years and borrowing at a lower interest rate

C: Plan A

D: Plan B, with the guild members contributing an additional $1,000 upfront for future renovations

E: Plan A, but with an additional loan taken out in the 10th year

F: Plan A, with a smaller renovation every 5 years using money from fundraising events

G: Plan B

H: Both plans

I: Plan B, with additional renovations every 3 years financed by ticket sales

J: Neither plans

Wait, the question is two parts, (a) and (b), but the options don't split them. So perhaps the options are considering each part, but the way the question is presented is as a single question with two parts, but the options are separate.

Wait, the user presented the question as a single multiple-choice question, with options A-J, each being a choice for the entire scenario, I think. Because the question is phrased as "Which plan should the guild follow?" and part (b) is an alternative scenario.

Wait, perhaps the actual question is part (a) only, and part (b) is a follow-up, but the options are each possible answers, perhaps for both parts. Hmm, but the way the question is presented is as a single question with two parts, but the options are singular.

Alternatively, perhaps each option is a possible answer that could apply to either (a) or (b). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me re-examine the question.

The question is: (a) which plan? (b) if in Plan B, the 2nd and 3rd renovations cost $3,000 each, and members have to contribute, which plan?

So the options A-J are possible answers. Each option is a possible choice, perhaps answering both (a) and (b), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the options are for each part, but the user wants the answer in a specific way.

Wait, the initial question says "Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer." So it's a single question with two parts, but the options are for the entire question, perhaps indicating which plan is better in each scenario.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are for each part, but the user is only asking for part (a) and part (b) as separate, but the options are given as choices for each part.

Wait, perhaps the user is only asking for part (a). Because the way the question is presented, part (b) is a variation. But the initial problem statement includes both (a) and (b). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the options are for the overall question, and the correct answer depends on both parts. But looking at the options, they don't address both parts. Let me look again.

Option C says Plan A. Option G says Plan B. So perhaps for part (a), the correct answer is Plan B, which is option G. For part (b), the correct answer is Plan A, which is option C.

But the options are for the entire question, so perhaps the correct choice is the one that correctly answers both parts. But since the options don't combine (a) and (b), perhaps each part is a separate question, but the user is presenting it as a single problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only part (a), and part (b) is a follow-up, but in the given options, the correct answer is option G for part (a) and option C for part (b). But the user's question is phrased as having both parts, but the options are single answers.

Wait, perhaps the user is only asking about part (a), and part (b) is additional info. Alternatively, I'm getting confused. Let me try to clarify.

The original question has two parts: (a) and (b). Each part is a different scenario. So the multiple-choice options must address each part. But the options don't indicate that; each option is a standalone answer, perhaps answering (a) or (b). So perhaps the correct answer for (a) is G (Plan B) and for (b) is C (Plan A).

But looking at the options, option G is "Plan B", option C is "Plan A".

So for part (a), the answer is Plan B, which is option G. For part (b), the answer is Plan A, which is option C.

But the options are given as possible answers to the entire question, perhaps only for part (a), because part (b) is a separate scenario.

Wait, the way the question is presented: the first paragraph sets up the two plans, then part (a) asks which plan, and part (b) modifies Plan B and asks again.

But the options are A-J, each being a possible answer, perhaps for each part. Alternatively, perhaps the options are for (a) only.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only part (a), and part (b) is an alternative scenario not covered by the options. But the user provided both parts, so I'm a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are for the initial question (part a), and part (b) is a separate consideration. But I'm not sure.

Let me try to re-examine the question and the options. The user wrote:

"(a) Which plan should the guild follow? (b) If, in Plan B, the 2nd and 3rd renovation jobs will cost $3,000 each and the guild will not be able to borrow the money for any of the three jobs (i.e., the members will have to contribute), which plan should the guild follow?"

So the question has two separate parts. Each part is a separate question, but the options are provided as letters A-J, each being a possible answer, perhaps for each part. But the options don't specify which part they correspond to.

Wait, perhaps the options are for both parts together
