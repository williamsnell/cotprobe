Question:

What is behavior? Are behavior patterns solely inherited or canthey be modified?

Options:

A: Behavior patterns cannot be modified
B: Behavior is limited to the animal kingdom
C: Behavior is a random set of actions without any pattern or predictability
D: Behavior patterns are determined exclusively by environmental factors without any genetic influence
E: Behavior patterns are solely determined by immediate stimuli and are not influenced by past experiences
F: Behavior patterns are fixed at birth and remain unchanged throughout an individual's life
G: Behavior is an exclusively human trait not found in other animals
H: Behavior is only learned through imitation and cannot be innate
I: Both inheritance and learning are fundamental in the determination of behavioral patterns
J: Behavior patterns are solely inherited

Okay, so I have this question about behavior, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by breaking it down.

The question is asking two things: what is behavior, and whether behavior patterns are solely inherited or can they be modified. The options are from A to J, so I need to pick the right one.

First, I should understand what behavior means. Behavior refers to the way an organism acts in response to its environment. It can include physical actions, like running or eating, and more complex things like problem-solving or social interactions. Behavior isn't just random; it often follows patterns, which can be influenced by various factors.

Now, the second part of the question is whether behavior patterns are solely inherited or can they be modified. I remember from my biology classes that behavior is influenced by both genetics and the environment. For example, some behaviors are instincts, which are inherited. Like how a bird builds a nest without being taught. But other behaviors are learned, like a child learning to speak a language by hearing it. So, it's not just one or the other; both factors play a role.

Looking at the options:

Option I says both inheritance and learning are fundamental in determining behavior. That makes sense because it combines the two aspects. Other options seem to neglect one aspect. For example, J says solely inherited, which ignores learning. Similarly, D says only environmental, which ignores genetics. So I is looking correct.

Other options seem incorrect. B says behavior is limited to animals, but plants can have behaviors too, like phototropism. C says behavior is random, but that's not true because there are clear patterns. E says immediate stimuli only, but experiences definitely shape behavior. F says fixed at birth, but learning changes behavior. G says only humans, which is wrong because animals have behaviors. H says only through imitation, but many behaviors are innate. A says can't be modified, which is false because learning modifies behavior.

So the correct answer must be I.

The correct answer is I because behavior is shaped by both inheritance and learning.
