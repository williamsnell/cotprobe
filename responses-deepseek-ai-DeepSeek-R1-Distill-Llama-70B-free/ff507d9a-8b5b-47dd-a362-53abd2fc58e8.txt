Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the scientific characteristics of psychology. Hmm, I need to figure out which option is correct. Let me break it down.

The question is asking for the scientific characteristics, so I should think about what makes psychology a science. I remember that sciences like physics or biology are empirical, systematic, and use measurements. So psychology should be similar.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Psychology is a natural science studying inanimate objects. Wait, no, psychology studies behavior and mental processes, not inanimate objects. So A is probably wrong.

Option B: Based on intuition and opinion. That doesn't sound right. Science relies on evidence, not just opinions. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Psychology is not empirical. Empirical means based on observation and experience. Psychology uses experiments and data, so C is wrong.

Option D: Empirical, systematic, uses measurement. That fits with what I know. Psychology uses these methods to study behavior, so D seems correct.

Option E: Random observation without systematic methods. No, psychology uses systematic research and replication, so E is wrong.

Option F: Studies only group behavior, ignoring individuals. No, psychology looks at both individual differences and group behaviors, so F is incorrect.

Option G: Solely about animal behavior, not humans. No, psychology includes human behavior as well, so G is wrong.

Option H: Relies only on theory without experimentation. No, psychology does experiments, so H is wrong.

Option I: Pseudoscience that can't predict or be falsified. No, psychology can make predictions and its theories can be tested, so I is incorrect.

Option J: Doesn't use measurement techniques. No, psychology does use measurements, like surveys and tests, so J is wrong.

So the correct answer should be D.

The correct answer is D. Psychology is empirical, systematic, and employs measurement techniques.

Answer: D
