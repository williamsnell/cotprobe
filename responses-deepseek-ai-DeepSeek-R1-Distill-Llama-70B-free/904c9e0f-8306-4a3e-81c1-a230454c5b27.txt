Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the rate of interest that would produce $12 on $1,200 in 90 days. Hmm, let's see. I remember that interest calculations can be a bit tricky, but I think I can figure this out step by step.

First, I should probably recall the formula for simple interest. I think it's I = P * R * T, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest, and T is the time in years. Right, that's the basic formula.

So in this case, the interest I is $12, the principal P is $1,200, and the time T is 90 days. Wait, but time needs to be in years, not days. Oh right, so I need to convert 90 days into a fraction of a year. I remember that a year has 365 days, so 90 days would be 90/365 years. Let me calculate that: 90 divided by 365 is approximately 0.2466 years. Okay, so T is about 0.2466.

Now plugging the values into the formula: 12 = 1200 * R * 0.2466. I need to solve for R. So let me rearrange the formula. R would be equal to I divided by (P multiplied by T).

So R = 12 / (1200 * 0.2466). Let me compute the denominator first. 1200 multiplied by 0.2466 is... let's see, 1200 times 0.2 is 240, 1200 times 0.04 is 48, 1200 times 0.0066 is approximately 7.92. Adding those together: 240 + 48 is 288, plus 7.92 gives me 295.92. So the denominator is 295.92.

Now, R is 12 divided by 295.92. Let me do that division. 12 divided by 295.92. Hmm, let's approximate. 295.92 goes into 12 how many times? Well, since 295 is bigger than 12, it's less than 1. Maybe around 0.04 times? Let me check: 295.92 multiplied by 0.04 is 11.8368, which is close to 12. So R is approximately 0.04.

Wait, 0.04 as a decimal is 4%. So that would be 4% interest. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, 0.04 times 295.92 is indeed about 11.84, which is just a bit less than 12. So maybe it's a little more than 4%. Let me compute it more accurately. 12 divided by 295.92 equals approximately 0.04054, which is about 4.054%. So if we round that to the nearest option, it's 4%. Let me look at the options: J is 4%, so that's probably the correct answer.

Alternatively, I can think about it another way. If $1,200 earns $12 in 90 days, what's the annual rate? Since 90 days is a quarter of a year, I can find the quarterly interest and then multiply by 4 to get the annual rate. But wait, no, that's not quite right because the formula I used already accounts for the time in years.

Wait, another approach: The interest for 90 days is $12. So for one year, which is 4 times 90 days (approximately), the interest would be 4 * 12 = $48. So the annual interest would be $48 on $1,200. Then the rate R would be (48/1200)*100. Let me compute that: 48 divided by 1200 is 0.04, which is 4%. So that's the same answer as before.

So both methods give me 4%, which is option J. I think that's correct.

To determine the rate of interest that would produce $12 on $1,200 in 90 days, we use the simple interest formula:

\[
I = P \cdot R \cdot T
\]

Where:
- \( I = \$12 \) (interest),
- \( P = \$1,200 \) (principal),
- \( T = \frac{90}{365} \approx 0.2466 \) years (time in years).

Rearranging the formula to solve for \( R \):

\[
R = \frac{I}{P \cdot T}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
R = \frac{12}{1200 \cdot 0.2466} = \frac{12}{295.92} \approx 0.0405
\]

Converting \( R \) to a percentage:

\[
R \approx 4.05\%
\]

This rounds to 4%. Verifying with an alternative approach, the interest for 90 days is $12. For a full year (4 times 90 days), the interest would be \( 4 \cdot 12 = \$48 \). The annual rate is:

\[
R = \frac{48}{1200} \cdot 100 = 4\%
\]

Both methods confirm that the rate is 4%, which corresponds to option **J**.
