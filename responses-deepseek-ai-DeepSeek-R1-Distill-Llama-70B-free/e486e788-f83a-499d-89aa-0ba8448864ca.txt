Alright, so I've got this problem here about calculating the mass flow rate of water being pumped through a pipeline. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

The question says the horsepower required is 3 HP, and I need to find the mass flow rate. It also mentions that the flow is steady and isothermal, and there's no friction loss in the pipeline. Hmm, okay, so I think I can ignore any losses due to friction, which probably simplifies things a bit.

I remember that power is related to work done, and in this context, the power provided by the pump is used to do work on the water, specifically to increase its potential energy or to push it through the pipe. Since there's no friction loss, maybe all the power is going into moving the water, maybe giving it kinetic energy or lifting it against gravity. But the question doesn't mention any elevation change, so perhaps it's just about moving the water through the pipe.

Wait, but in fluid mechanics, power is often calculated as the product of pressure and flow rate. The formula I think is Power (P) equals pressure (P) multiplied by the volumetric flow rate (Q). But wait, P = F * A, so maybe that's another approach, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another formula I remember is P = m * g * h * w, but that's for pumps doing work against gravity. Maybe I'm mixing things up.

Hold on, I should probably look up the relevant equations. Oh wait, this is a thought process, so I'm just working through it. Let me think again. 

I recall that power can be expressed as the product of force and velocity. But in the context of fluids, perhaps it's more about the pressure and the flow rate. So the formula P = P * Q, where P is pressure in Pascals (or other units), and Q is volumetric flow rate in m³/s or similar. Wait, no, that would give units of power as (N/m²) * (m³/s) = N*m/s = Watts, which makes sense. So that's correct.

But in this problem, the units are given in horsepower, so I need to convert that to watts. I remember that 1 horsepower (HP) is approximately 745.7 watts. So 3 HP would be 3 * 745.7 = 2237 watts. So P = 2237 W.

But wait, another approach: the power required to pump a fluid can also be calculated using the formula P = (mass flow rate * g * h) / efficiency, but since there's no mention of efficiency or height, maybe that's not the case here. Alternatively, maybe it's about the work done per unit time, which would be power.

Wait, but the problem says the flow is steady and isothermal, which probably means we can treat the fluid properties as constant. Also, since there's no friction loss, the power is only used to overcome the pressure difference or to move the fluid. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the definition of horsepower. I think in the Imperial system, 1 HP is equal to 550 foot-pounds per second. So 3 HP would be 3 * 550 = 1650 foot-pounds per second.

But power is also work done over time, so in this case, the work done per second is 1650 ft·lb/s.

Now, work done on the fluid could be related to the pressure and volume flow rate. The formula I think is P = (P * Q), where P is pressure and Q is volumetric flow rate. But what units are we using here?

Wait, if I'm using horsepower in terms of foot-pounds per second, then I can write P = (pressure in psi) * (flow rate in cubic feet per second) * some conversion factor. Let me think about the units.

In the Imperial system, pressure is often in pounds per square inch (psi), and volumetric flow rate is in cubic feet per second (ft³/s). So if I have P in horsepower, which is 550 ft·lb/s per HP, then:

P (hp) = (P (psi) * Q (ft³/s)) / (some conversion factor)

I think the conversion factor comes from the fact that 1 psi is 1 lb/in², and 1 ft² is 144 in², so 1 psi is 1 lb/144 ft², but maybe I'm complicating things.

Alternatively, I remember that 1 horsepower equals 550 ft·lb/s, and 1 psi equals 1 lb/in². So to find the relation between power, pressure, and flow rate, let's see:

Power (in ft·lb/s) = pressure (in lb/ft²) * flow rate (in ft³/s). Because (lb/ft²) * (ft³/s) = (lb·ft)/s = ft·lb/s.

But pressure in psi needs to be converted to lb/ft². Since 1 psi = 144 lb/ft² (because 1 ft² = 144 in², so 1 lb/in² = 144 lb/ft²), so P_psi * 144 lb/ft².

So, Power (ft·lb/s) = (P_psi * 144) * Q_ft3/s.

But wait, in the problem, I don't have the pressure, so maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the power is being used to accelerate the fluid, but that would involve the velocity and the mass flow rate.

Wait, another approach: the power provided by the pump is equal to the mass flow rate times the specific work done on the fluid. The specific work (work per unit mass) can be expressed as (P / (ρ)) + (v²)/2 + g*h, but since there's no elevation change and no friction, perhaps only the pressure term matters. But without knowing the pressure, that might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think about the relationship between power, mass flow rate, and pressure. Since power is force times velocity, and force is pressure times area. Hmm.

Wait, power can also be expressed as the product of pressure and volumetric flow rate. So P = P * Q.

Wait, but units again. Let's make sure.

In SI units, P (watts) = P (Pa) * Q (m³/s). Because Pa is N/m², and m³/s multiplied by N/m² gives N*m/s = W.

In Imperial units, 1 horsepower is 550 ft·lb/s. So, power (hp) = (P (psi) * Q (ft³/s)) / conversion factor.

Because 1 psi is 1 lb/in², and 1 ft² is 144 in², so 1 psi = 144 lb/ft².

So P (ft·lb/s) = P (lb/ft²) * Q (ft³/s) = (P_psi * 144) * Q.

But since 1 hp = 550 ft·lb/s, then:

Power (hp) = (P_psi * Q (ft³/s)) * 144 / 550.

Wait, that might not be accurate. Let me think again.

Alternatively, P (hp) = (P (psi) * Q (gpm)) / (some conversion factor).

Wait, I might be getting confused because different sources sometimes present this formula with different units. Let me try to get it right.

I think the correct formula is:

Power (hp) = (P (psi) * Q (gpm)) / (3960).

Wait, that rings a bell. Let me check the units. If P is in psi and Q is in gallons per minute, then:

psi * gpm would be (lb/in²) * (gallon/minute).

But I need to convert this to horsepower. So, what's the conversion factor?

I think the formula is:

HP = (P * Q) / 3960, where P is in psi and Q is in gpm.

So, if I can find Q in gpm, I can find HP.

But wait, the problem gives HP as 3, so 3 = (P * Q) / 3960.

But wait, I don't know P or Q, so maybe this approach isn't helpful unless I have more information.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the definition of horsepower in terms of mass flow rate and velocity. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about the relationship between power and mass flow rate. Power is energy per unit time, and energy can be related to the work done to move the mass.

In the absence of friction and considering steady flow, perhaps the power is used to provide kinetic energy to the water. So, the kinetic energy per unit time (power) would be (1/2) * m * v² / t, so P = (1/2) * (m/t) * v².

Where m/t is the mass flow rate, let's call it m_dot. So, P = (1/2) * m_dot * v².

But wait, I don't know the velocity v, so maybe that's not helpful unless I can relate it to something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the power is used to provide the pressure energy, so P = m_dot * (P / ρ), where ρ is the density of water.

Wait, because P = pressure, and the energy per unit mass is P/(ρ), so power would be m_dot * (P / ρ).

But again, without knowing P, I can't proceed.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think about the units again.

We need to find the mass flow rate, which is in lbm/s. The power is given as 3 HP.

So, perhaps the key is to relate power to mass flow rate directly, using the density of water.

Wait, let's think in terms of energy. The power provided by the pump is doing work on the water, which could be in terms of increasing its pressure or velocity.

But without knowing either, perhaps we can consider the specific energy, but I'm stuck.

Wait, another approach: using the definition of horsepower in terms of lifting water.

I remember that 1 HP is equivalent to lifting 33,000 pounds (lb) of water per minute by one foot. That's a common definition.

Oh, that's a helpful piece of information. So, 1 HP = 33,000 lb·ft/min.

Wait, let's break that down. 33,000 lb lifted by 1 ft in one minute.

So, the work done is force times distance. Force is mass times gravity, but in this case, it's just the weight, so force would be mass in lb (since lb is a unit of force in the Imperial system).

Wait, in the Imperial system, weight is in pounds (lb), which is force. Mass is in slugs, but here, the problem uses lbm for mass.

So, the work done is 33,000 lb * 1 ft = 33,000 ft·lb.

Power is work done per unit time. So, 33,000 ft·lb per minute. But 1 HP is 550 ft·lb per second, so let me check:

33,000 ft·lb/min = 33,000 / 60 = 550 ft·lb/s. Yep, that matches the definition.

So, 1 HP = 550 ft·lb/s.

So, for 3 HP, the power is 3 * 550 = 1650 ft·lb/s.

Now, the power is being used to pump water, so the work done per second is 1650 ft·lb/s.

Assuming that the work done is to lift the water, but since the problem doesn't mention any elevation change, perhaps it's just pushing the water through the pipe, so maybe we can model it as work done against pressure.

Wait, but without knowing the pressure, perhaps we can think in terms of the mass flow rate.

Wait, another approach: The power is related to the mass flow rate and the head (which is the height lifted or the pressure). But without knowing the head, perhaps this isn't directly applicable.

Wait, but maybe the head can be considered as the pressure in the pipeline. So, perhaps the power can be expressed as P = m_dot * g * h, where h is the head (in feet). But I'm getting into more unknowns here.

Alternatively, let's think about the definition of HP in terms of mass flow rate.

Wait, since 1 HP lifts 33,000 lbm/min by 1 ft, then the mass flow rate for 1 HP would be 33,000 lbm/min.

Wait, because 33,000 lbm lifted per minute, so that's 33,000 lbm/min.

So, for 1 HP, mass flow rate is 33,000 lbm/min.

So, 3 HP would be 3 * 33,000 = 99,000 lbm/min.

But wait, the question asks for the mass flow rate in lbm/s, so we need to convert that.

99,000 lbm/min divided by 60 seconds per minute gives 1650 lbm/s.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 1500 lbm/s, which is close but not exact. Hmm. Wait, my calculation here: 3 HP * 33,000 lbm/min per HP = 99,000 lbm/min.

99,000 / 60 = 1650 lbm/s.

But none of the options exactly match 1650. Let me check the options again. The options are:

A: 1500 lbm/s

B: 816 lbm/s

C: 500 lbm/s

D: 1340 lbm/s

E: 1200 lbm/s

F: 950 lbm/s

G: 625 lbm/s

H: 1100 lbm/s

I: 1000 lbm/s

J: 700 lbm/s

Hmm, 1650 isn't listed, so maybe I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I misapplied the definition of HP. Let me double-check.

The definition I remember is 1 HP = 33,000 lb lifted one foot per minute. So, that's work done = 33,000 ft·lb per minute.

But power is work per unit time, so 33,000 ft·lb/min = 550 ft·lb/s, which is 1 HP.

Wait, but another approach: the power required to pump water can also be calculated as P = (m_dot * g * h) / (e * 550), but again, without knowing h or efficiency e, perhaps that's not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the power is equal to the mass flow rate multiplied by the specific work done. The specific work (work per unit mass) would be the pressure difference times the specific volume. Since specific volume is 1/density.

Assuming that the pump is providing the pressure to move the water, the power can be expressed as P = m_dot * (P / ρ).

But without knowing the pressure P, I can't proceed. So perhaps that's not the way.

Wait, maybe I should think about the units again. The mass flow rate is in lbm/s, and power is in HP.

I think I need to find a way to relate HP directly to mass flow rate without involving pressure or velocity.

Wait, going back to the 1 HP = 33,000 lb lifted per minute. So, the mass flow rate is 33,000 lbm/min for 1 HP. So, for 3 HP, it's 99,000 lbm/min, which is 99,000 / 60 = 1650 lbm/s.

But as I saw, 1650 isn't an option. So maybe I'm missing a factor here.

Wait, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in units. Let me make sure. The problem says "mass flow rate", so lbm/s.

Wait, 33,000 lbm/min is per HP, so 3 HP is 99,000 lbm/min. 99,000 divided by 60 is indeed 1650 lbm/s.

But none of the options match. So, perhaps I'm using the wrong approach.

Alternatively, maybe the question is referring to the power being used to provide kinetic energy, not potential. So, P = 0.5 * m_dot * v^2.

But without knowing v, I can't find m_dot. Unless perhaps I can relate it through the specific energy.

Wait, but then I don't know v either.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the power as the product of pressure and volumetric flow rate. So P = P * Q.

So, if I can find Q, the volumetric flow rate, then I can find the mass flow rate by multiplying by density.

But again, without knowing P, I can't find Q directly.

Wait, but maybe I can use the density of water. The density of water is about 62.4 lbm/ft³.

So, if I can find the volumetric flow rate Q (in ft³/s), then mass flow rate m_dot = 62.4 * Q lbm/s.

So, if I can find Q, I can find m_dot.

But how? Using the power equation.

Power P = P * Q.

We have P in HP, which is 3 HP. So, 3 HP in ft·lb/s is 3 * 550 = 1650 ft·lb/s.

So, P (ft·lb/s) = P (lb/ft²) * Q (ft³/s).

Wait, that makes sense. Because (lb/ft²) * (ft³/s) = lb*ft/s = ft·lb/s.

So, 1650 ft·lb/s = P (lb/ft²) * Q (ft³/s).

But without knowing P, I can't find Q. Hmm, this is tricky.

Wait, perhaps the pressure is related to the velocity or something else. Alternatively, maybe the problem is assuming that the power is used to provide both kinetic and potential energy, but without elevation change, perhaps it's only kinetic. But again, without velocity, I can't proceed.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think again about the definition of HP in terms of mass flow rate.

I think the key is that 1 HP is equivalent to 33,000 lb of water per minute being lifted one foot. So, that's the mass flow rate times the work done (g*h). So, the power is m_dot * g * h.

But since we're in Imperial units, let's clarify.

In Imperial units, weight W = m * g, where g is 32.174 ft/s². But in the definition, HP is based on lifting a certain weight, not mass.

So, 1 HP lifts 33,000 lb (weight, which is force) per minute to a height of 1 ft.

So, the work done per minute is 33,000 lb * 1 ft = 33,000 ft·lb.

Power is work per unit time, so per second, that's 33
