Okay, so I've got this question here about muscle contraction fuel during short-term intense activity like sprinting. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my sports science, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, I remember that when you're doing high-intensity, short-duration activities, your body uses different energy sources compared to longer, more endurance-based exercises. Let me break it down.

So, the main energy systems involved are the ATP-PC system and the glycolytic system. For something like sprinting, which is quick and intense, the ATP stored in the muscles is used up almost immediately. But that only lasts a few seconds. Then, the body starts breaking down glycogen to produce more ATP quickly.

Wait, where is glycogen stored? I think there are two main storage sites: the liver and the muscles. Liver glycogen can be broken down into glucose and released into the bloodstream, but I'm not sure if that's the primary source for muscles during intense activity. Muscle glycogen, on the other hand, is stored directly in the muscle cells. So during sprinting, the muscles probably use their own glycogen stores for energy.

Plasma glucose comes from the liver, right? So if the liver releases glucose, that's plasma glucose. But for very intense activities, the muscles might not have time to wait for glucose to be transported from the blood. They need a quicker source, so they'd rely more on their stored glycogen.

What about fatty acids? I remember that fats are a major energy source during prolonged, low to moderate intensity activities. But sprinting is short and intense, so I don't think the body has enough time to metabolize fats as the main fuel. They're more for endurance.

Protein is usually not a primary energy source unless during prolonged fasting or extreme conditions, so that's probably not it for sprinting.

So putting it all together: the main fuel should be muscle glycogen. That's option C.

The main fuel for muscle contraction during short-term intense activity, such as sprinting, is muscle glycogen. During high-intensity efforts, the body relies heavily on the ATP-PC system and the glycolytic system. While ATP is depleted quickly, glycogen stored in the muscles is rapidly broken down to produce ATP, making it the primary energy source. Other options, like plasma glucose or fatty acids, are less relevant in this context due to the intensity and duration of the activity.

Answer: C
