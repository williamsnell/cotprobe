Question:

Discuss the role of a stimulus that elicits a behavior pattern.

Options:

A: Stimuli can only elicit a response if they are intense
B: Stimuli intensity directly affects the animal's motivation
C: Stimuli have no influence on an animal's behavior
D: Stimuli serve as a universal language, eliciting the same behavior patterns across different species.
E: Stimuli, referred to as sign stimuli, elicit specific responses from an animal. The intensity of the stimuli necessary to evoke a behavior pattern is inversely proportional to the animal's motivation to perform that behavior.
F: Stimuli are only effective if they are novel and unfamiliar to the animal.
G: Stimuli that elicit behavior patterns are only visual; other sensory modalities do not trigger responses.
H: Stimuli are passive elements in the environment and require the animal to interpret them before eliciting a behavior pattern.
I: The animal's motivation to perform a behavior has no impact on how stimuli affect behavior patterns.
J: Stimuli must be paired with a reward to elicit any behavior pattern.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about the role of a stimulus in eliciting a behavior pattern. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is discussing the role of a stimulus that leads to a specific behavior. I remember from my biology class that stimuli play a big role in animal behavior, especially in things like instincts and learned behaviors. So, I need to look through the options and find the one that best describes how stimuli work in this context.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A says that stimuli can only elicit a response if they're intense. Hmm, I don't think that's right. I remember examples where even slight stimuli can cause a reaction. Like, a very specific sound might trigger a response in an animal, even if it's not very loud. So intensity might not be the only factor here.

Option B states that the intensity of the stimulus directly affects the animal's motivation. Wait, I think motivation might influence how much stimulus is needed. Like, if an animal is really motivated, maybe a weaker stimulus would suffice. So if intensity and motivation are directly related, I'm not sure. I think it might be inversely related, actually.

Option C claims that stimuli have no influence on behavior. That can't be right. Stimuli are a major factor in triggering behaviors, especially in things like reflexes and instinctive behaviors.

Option D suggests that stimuli are a universal language, causing the same behaviors across species. I don't think so. Different species react differently to the same stimulus. For example, a red belly in a stickleback fish signals aggression, but another species might not react the same way.

Option E says that stimuli, called sign stimuli, elicit specific responses, and the intensity needed is inversely proportional to the animal's motivation. Oh, that rings a bell. I remember learning about sign stimuli in the context of fixed action patterns. The idea is that a specific stimulus triggers a specific response. Also, if an animal is more motivated, a less intense stimulus might be enough to elicit the behavior. So this seems plausible.

Option F says stimuli are only effective if novel. No, that's not right. Familiar stimuli can also elicit responses. For example, a bird's song to attract a mate is a familiar stimulus to the species.

Option G claims that only visual stimuli matter. That's incorrect because animals use all sorts of stimuliâ€”like sounds, smells, touch, etc. For instance, bees use chemical pheromones, which are olfactory stimuli.

Option H states that stimuli are passive and require the animal to interpret them. Well, I think that's true to some extent because the animal's nervous system processes the stimuli. But the option doesn't directly address the relationship between stimulus intensity and behavior elicitation.

Option I says motivation doesn't affect how stimuli influence behavior. But I think motivation does play a role. A more motivated animal might respond more readily, even with a weaker stimulus.

Option J claims that stimuli must be paired with a reward. That sounds more like operant conditioning, where behavior is learned through rewards or punishments. But the question is about stimuli eliciting behavior patterns, which could be instinctive rather than learned. So this might not apply.

Putting it all together, the correct answer seems to be option E. It correctly identifies sign stimuli and explains the inverse relationship between stimulus intensity and the animal's motivation.

The correct answer is **E**. 

Stimuli referred to as sign stimuli elicit specific responses from animals, often triggering fixed action patterns. The intensity of the stimulus required to evoke a behavior is inversely proportional to the animal's motivation. This means that a more motivated animal may respond to a weaker stimulus, while a less motivated animal might require a stronger one. This explanation aligns with how stimuli influence behavior in various contexts, particularly in instinctive behaviors.

Answer: E
