Okay, so I have this problem here about calculating the target variable manufacturing cost for a new product. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my accounting terms, but let's try to break it down.

The question says the expected selling price is $19.00, and management wants a 20% contribution margin on all sales. Oh right, contribution margin is the amount left after variable costs to cover fixed costs and provide profit. So the formula I remember is Contribution Margin = Sales - Variable Costs.

Wait, but wait. Contribution margin can also be expressed as a percentage. Oh right, the contribution margin ratio is (Contribution Margin / Sales) * 100%. So here, the goal is 20% contribution margin ratio.

The product has variable selling and distribution costs of $3.00 per unit. I think those are part of the variable costs. But the question is asking about the variable manufacturing cost, which I suppose is another part of the variable costs.

So, let me structure this. The total variable costs per unit would be the sum of variable selling/distribution costs and variable manufacturing costs. Let me denote variable manufacturing cost as VMC.

So total variable costs (TVC) per unit = VMC + $3.00.

The selling price (SP) is $19.00. The contribution margin per unit is Sales minus TVC. But since the contribution margin ratio is 20%, that means:

Contribution Margin per unit = SP * Contribution Margin Ratio.

Wait, or is it (SP - TVC) / SP = 20%? So, (SP - TVC) = 0.20 * SP.

Yes, that makes sense.

So let's plug in the numbers. SP is $19.

So, $19 - TVC = 0.20 * $19.

Calculate 0.20 * 19: 0.2 * 19 is 3.8. So 19 - TVC = 3.8.

Wait, that can't be right. If 19 minus TVC is 3.8, then TVC would be 19-3.8=15.2. Hmm, but wait that's the total variable costs.

Wait, wait a second. Let me think again. Contribution margin is Sales minus variable costs. So Contribution Margin (CM) = SP - TVC.

And the contribution margin ratio is CM / SP. So (SP - TVC)/SP = 0.20.

Yes, so solving for TVC:

SP - TVC = 0.20 * SP

So TVC = SP - (0.20 * SP) = 0.80 * SP.

Wait no, that can't be right because 0.20 is the margin, so the variable costs would be 80% of SP?

Wait no, wait. Let's clarify.

If the contribution margin ratio is 20%, that means 20% of the selling price is the contribution margin. So CM = 0.20 * SP.

Then, since CM = SP - TVC, we can write:

0.20 * SP = SP - TVC

So, solving for TVC:

TVC = SP - (0.20 * SP) = 0.80 * SP.

Wait, that would make TVC 0.8 * 19 = $15.20.

But wait, earlier I thought that TVC is the sum of variable manufacturing cost and the $3.00 selling and distribution. So:

TVC = VMC + $3.00.

So, $15.20 = VMC + $3.00.

Therefore, VMC = 15.20 - 3.00 = $12.20.

Looking at the options, option H is $12.20. So the answer should be H.

But wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Contribution margin ratio is 20%, so CM = 0.2 * SP.
2. SP is $19, so CM = 3.8.
3. CM is also SP - TVC, so 3.8 = 19 - TVC.
4. Solving for TVC gives TVC = 19 - 3.8 = 15.2.
5. TVC includes both variable manufacturing and variable selling/distribution costs.
6. Variable selling is $3, so VMC = TVC - 3 = 15.2 - 3 = 12.2.

Yes, that makes sense. So the target variable manufacturing cost is $12.20, which is option H.
</think>

To determine the product's target variable manufacturing cost (VMC), we start by understanding the relationship between the selling price (SP), contribution margin (CM), and total variable costs (TVC). The contribution margin ratio is given as 20%, which means:

\[
\text{Contribution Margin Ratio} = \frac{\text{CM}}{\text{SP}} = 0.20
\]

From this, the contribution margin (CM) per unit can be calculated as:

\[
\text{CM} = \text{SP} \times 0.20 = 19 \times 0.20 = 3.80
\]

The contribution margin is also defined as:

\[
\text{CM} = \text{SP} - \text{TVC}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
3.80 = 19 - \text{TVC}
\]

Solving for TVC:

\[
\text{TVC} = 19 - 3.80 = 15.20
\]

The total variable costs (TVC) include both the variable manufacturing cost (VMC) and the variable selling and distribution costs, which are given as $3.00 per unit. Therefore:

\[
\text{TVC} = \text{VMC} + 3.00
\]

Solving for VMC:

\[
\text{VMC} = \text{TVC} - 3.00 = 15.20 - 3.00 = 12.20
\]

Thus, the product's target variable manufacturing cost is **$12.20**, which corresponds to option **H**.
