Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Sometimes these problems are a bit tricky, but I'll take it slow.

Alright, the question is about a monoatomic ideal gas undergoing an adiabatic and reversible compression. The given data are: 2 moles of the gas, initial temperature is 45°C, initial volume is 75 liters, and it's compressed to 20 liters. We need to find q, W, ΔH, and ΔE for the process, and we're told to ignore vibrational contributions.

First, I remember that in an adiabatic process, there's no heat exchange with the surroundings, so q should be zero. That's a key point. So any options where q is not zero can probably be eliminated. Let me check the options again. Wait, no, I should think through everything else too, but that's a good starting point.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Because I'm a bit confused. I thought that in an adiabatic process, q is zero because no heat is exchanged. So that would mean in the options, q must be zero. So looking at the options, any option that has a non-zero q can be ruled out. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

A: q=0 → possible

B: q=11.21kJ → not possible, because q should be zero.

C: q=0 → possible

D: q=18.68kJ → not possible.

E: q=0 → possible

F: q=11.21kJ → nope.

G: q=22.50kJ → no.

H: q=0 → possible.

I: q=18.68 → no.

J: q=18.68 → no.

So the possible options are A, C, E, H.

Now I need to find which of these is correct based on other parameters.

Next, I need to find ΔE and ΔH.

Since it's a monoatomic ideal gas, I can recall some specific heat capacities. For monoatomic gases, the molar specific heat at constant volume (Cv) is (3/2)R, and at constant pressure (Cp) is (5/2)R.

The internal energy change, ΔE, for an ideal gas depends only on temperature change. Since it's an adiabatic process, the work done will equal the change in internal energy. But wait, wait—adiabatic processes for ideal gases can be solved using the relation TV^(γ-1) = constant, or PV^γ = constant, where γ is the heat capacity ratio, Cp/Cv.

For a monoatomic gas, γ = (5/2 R)/(3/2 R) = 5/3 ≈ 1.6667.

The process is adiabatic and reversible, so we can use the formula:

T1 * V1^(γ-1) = T2 * V2^(γ-1)

We can find T2 from this.

Wait, but maybe I should use the work formula for an adiabatic process. Since q=0, ΔU = W. But wait, the first law says ΔU = q + W, right? No, wait, I think the first law is ΔU = q - W, where W is the work done by the system. But sometimes different conventions are used. Hmm, I might need to clarify this.

Wait, in physics, the first law is often written as ΔU = q + W, where W is the work done on the system. But in some contexts, especially chemistry, it's written as ΔU = q - PΔV (where PΔV is the work done by the system). So I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, when work is done by the system, it's considered positive in some conventions and negative in others.

Alternatively, perhaps I should remember that in an adiabatic process, q=0, so ΔU = -W, where W is the work done by the system.

But I think the correct approach is to calculate the change in internal energy and then find the work done, knowing that q is zero.

So, let's compute the temperatures first. The initial temperature is 45°C, which is 318.15 K (since 45 + 273.15 = 318.15).

Using the adiabatic condition:

T1 * V1^(γ-1) = T2 * V2^(γ-1)

We can solve for T2.

V1 is 75 L, V2 is 20 L. So the ratio V1/V2 is 75/20 = 3.75.

γ is 5/3, so γ -1 = 2/3.

So,

T2 = T1 * (V1 / V2)^(γ-1) 

Wait, no. Because when the volume decreases (compression), the temperature increases. So the equation is T2 = T1 * (V1/V2)^(γ-1).

Wait, actually, the correct relation is T2 = T1 * (V1/V2)^(γ-1) when the process is adiabatic. Let me confirm: for an adiabatic compression (volume decreases), the temperature increases. So yes, T2 is higher than T1.

So plugging in the numbers: T2 = 318.15 K * (75/20)^(2/3)

Compute 75/20 = 3.75.

So 3.75^(2/3) is the same as (3.75^(1/3))^2.

What's the cube root of 3.75? Let's see, 3.75 is between 3 (1.442²=?) Wait, cube root of 3.375 is 1.5 because 1.5^3 is 3.375. So 3.75 is a little larger. Let me compute it more accurately.

3.75 = 15/4.

So the cube root of 15/4 is approximately, let's see:

Let me compute 3.75^(1/3) ≈ 1.55.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute 3.75^(2/3) more accurately.

Alternatively, take natural logs.

ln(3.75) ≈ 1.3218.

Multiply by (2/3): 1.3218 * (2/3) ≈ 0.8812.

Exponentiate: e^0.8812 ≈ 2.414.

So T2 ≈ 318.15 K * 2.414 ≈ ?

Compute 318 * 2.414:

Let me compute 300*2.414 = 724.2

18 * 2.414 ≈ 43.452

Total ≈ 724.2 + 43.452 = 767.652 K.

Wait, that seems high, but let's proceed.

So T2 ≈ 767.65 K.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps using more precise exponents.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relation for work done in an adiabatic process.

Wait, another approach is to compute the work done, W, using the formula:

W = (P1 V1 - P2 V2)/(γ - 1)

But for that, we need P1 and P2. Alternatively, since it's a reversible process, we can express W as:

W = (n R / (γ - 1)) (T2 - T1 )

Wait, because for an ideal gas, the internal energy change is n Cv ΔT, and since W = -ΔE (since q=0, ΔU = -W), so W = -n Cv (T2 - T1 )

Wait, Cv is (3/2) R per mole. So:

ΔE = n Cv (T2 - T1 )

Wait, no, because in an adiabatic process, Q=0, so ΔU = W (if W is defined as work done on the system) or ΔU = -W (if W is work done by the system). I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps we should think in terms of the first law:

ΔU = Q + W.

But according to IUPAC, work done on the system is positive. So if the system does work (expansion), W is negative, and if work is done on the system (compression), W is positive.

But in any case, for an adiabatic process, Q=0, so ΔU = W (when W is work done on the system) or ΔU = -W (if W is work done by the system). I think I need to clarify the sign conventions.

Wait, I think in the first law, ΔU = Q - W, where W is the work done by the system. So when the system does work (like expansion), W is positive, and when work is done on the system (compression), W is negative. So in this case, since the gas is being compressed, work is done on the gas, so W is negative. But since the process is adiabatic (Q=0), ΔU = -W.

Wait, no, if W is the work done by the system, then during compression, the system is doing negative work (or work is done on the system, so W is negative). So in this case, since the volume decreases, the system is having work done on it, so W (work done by system) is negative. Therefore, ΔU = Q - W → 0 - W → but W is negative, so ΔU = positive value.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the change in internal energy using the temperature change.

ΔE = n Cv (T2 - T1 )

Cv = (3/2) R, R is 8.314 J/mol·K.

n is 2 moles.

So ΔE = 2 * (3/2) R (T2 - T1 )

Which simplifies to 3 R (T2 - T1 )

Similarly, the work done on the gas (W) is equal to -ΔE, because in the formula, if work is done on the gas, W is positive. Wait, no, according to the first law, if the system does work, W is positive, and if work is done on the system, W is negative. Wait, this is getting confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for work done in an adiabatic process is W = (n R / (γ - 1)) (T2 - T1 )

Wait, but I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should compute the temperatures more accurately.

Wait, let me compute T2 again.

Given that T1 = 318.15 K, V1 =75 L, V2=20 L.

The relation is T2 = T1 * (V1/V2)^(γ-1)

Compute V1/V2 = 75/20 = 3.75.

γ is 5/3, so γ-1 = 2/3.

So T2 = 318.15 * (3.75)^(2/3)

Compute 3.75^(2/3).

Let me compute ln(3.75) = approximately 1.3218.

Multiply by 2/3: 1.3218 * 2/3 ≈ 0.8812.

Exponentiate: e^0.8812 ≈ 2.414.

So T2 ≈ 318.15 * 2.414 ≈ let's compute that.

318.15 * 2 = 636.3

318.15 * 0.414 ≈ ?

Compute 318.15 * 0.4 = 127.26

318.15 * 0.014 ≈ 4.4541

So 127.26 + 4.4541 ≈ 131.7141

Total T2 ≈ 636.3 + 131.7141 ≈ 768.014 K.

So T2 ≈ 768 K.

Now, compute the change in temperature: ΔT = T2 - T1 = 768 - 318.15 = 449.85 K.

Now, compute ΔE (change in internal energy):

ΔE = n Cv ΔT

n=2, Cv = (3/2) R

So ΔE = 2 * (3/2) R * 449.85 = 3 R * 449.85

R is 8.314 J/mol·K.

3 * 8.314 = 24.942.

24.942 * 449.85 ≈ let's compute that.

24.942 * 400 = 9976.8

24.942 * 49.85 ≈ ?

Compute 24.942 * 50 = 1247.1, but since it's 49.85, which is 50 - 0.15, subtract 24.942 * 0.15 = approx 3.7413.

So 1247.1 - 3.7413 ≈ 1243.3587.

Total ΔE ≈ 9976.8 + 1243.3587 ≈ 11220.16 J, which is about 11.22 kJ.

Wait, but wait, because the work done on the system is W = -ΔE, but I'm getting a bit tangled again. Alternatively, in an adiabatic process, the work done by the system is W = (P2 V2 - P1 V1)/(γ-1), but since the system is being compressed, the work done by the system is negative, meaning work is done on the system.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the work done using the formula:

W = (n R (T2 - T1 )) / (1 - γ)

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, since we have ΔE and knowing that q=0, we can find W from the first law.

Since ΔU = q + W → W = ΔU - q. But since q=0, W=ΔU.

But wait, in the first law, ΔU = q + W, where W is the work done on the system. So if the system is compressed, W is positive, so ΔU = 0 + W → W = ΔU.

So in this case, W = ΔE = 11.22 kJ.

But wait, earlier I calculated ΔE as approximately 11.22 kJ. So W would be 11.22 kJ, but wait, no—earlier I calculated ΔE as 3 R ΔT.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate ΔE.

ΔE = n Cv (T2 - T1 )

n=2, Cv = (3/2) R.

So:

ΔE = 2 * (3/2) R * (T2 - T1 )

The 2 and 3/2 cancel out to 3.

So ΔE = 3 * R * (T2 - T1 )

R is 8.314 J/mol·K.

T2 - T1 is 768.014 - 318.15 ≈ 449.85 K.

So 3 * 8.314 = 24.942 J/K.

24.942 J/K * 449.85 K = ?

Compute 24.942 * 400 = 9976.8 J

24.942 * 49.85 ≈ ?

As before, approximately 24.942 * 50 = 1247.1 J, minus 24.942 * 0.15 = approx 3.74 J.

So 1247.1 - 3.74 ≈ 1243.36 J.

So total is 9976.8 + 1243.36 ≈ 11220.16 J → 11.22 kJ.

So ΔE is approximately 11.22 kJ.

But wait, according to the first law, since q=0, W = -ΔE. Wait, no, because if the system's internal energy increases, that means the system has done negative work (work done on the system).

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it this way: when a gas is compressed, work is done on it, so the work W is positive. And since q=0, the internal energy increases by the amount of work done on the system.

Wait, but the first law is ΔU = q + W, where W is work done on the system. So when the system is compressed, W is positive, and since q=0, ΔU = W.

But in this case, the system is being compressed, so work is done on the system (positive W), and internal energy increases by that amount.

So that would mean that W = ΔU = 11.22 kJ.

But wait, earlier I thought that for an adiabatic process, the work done by the system is W = (T2 - T1) * n Cv / (1 - γ). Hmm, maybe I should use another formula.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the work done using the formula for an adiabatic process:

W = (P1 V1 - P2 V2)/(γ - 1)

But I don't have P1 or P2, but I can compute them using the ideal gas law.

Compute P1 and P2.

We have n=2, T1=318.15 K, V1=75 L.

Using PV = nRT, but need to convert volume to m³ and pressure to Pascals.

Wait, but maybe using R in units of L·kPa/(mol·K), which is 8.314 J/mol·K = 8.314 kPa·L/(mol·K).

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to compute P1 and P2 in terms of each other.

Alternatively, perhaps using the adiabatic relation P1 V1^γ = P2 V2^γ.

But since I can express P1 in terms of T1 and V1, perhaps I can find P2.

Alternatively, let me compute P1 first.

P1 = n R T1 / V1

n=2, R=0.0821 L·atm/mol·K (if I use R in these units), T1=318.15 K, V1=75 L.

So P1 = (2) * (0.0821) * 318.15 / 75

Compute numerator: 2 * 0.0821 = 0.1642.

0.1642 * 318.15 ≈ let's compute 0.1642 * 300 = 49.26, 0.1642 * 18.15 ≈ approx 2.98.

So total ≈ 49.26 + 2.98 ≈ 52.24.

Divide by 75: 52.24 /75 ≈ 0.6965 atm.

So P1 ≈ 0.6965 atm.

Now, using the adiabatic condition:

P1 V1^γ = P2 V2^γ

So P2 = P1 * (V1 / V2)^γ

V1=75, V2=20, so V
