Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's read it again to make sure I understand.

The problem says: "If the ratio of 2x - y to x + y is 2 to 3, what is the ratio of x to y? Express your answer as a common fraction." Oh, and there are multiple-choice options from A to J.

Alright, so the ratio (2x - y) : (x + y) is given as 2:3. I need to find x:y. Hmm. I remember that ratios can be converted into fractions, so maybe I can set up an equation.

Let me think. So if the ratio of (2x - y) to (x + y) is 2 to 3, that means (2x - y)/(x + y) = 2/3. Yeah, that sounds right.

So I can write the equation: (2x - y) divided by (x + y) equals 2/3. Now, I'll cross-multiply to solve for x and y. That should help me find the ratio x/y.

Cross-multiplying gives 3*(2x - y) = 2*(x + y). Let's compute both sides. On the left, 3*(2x) is 6x and 3*(-y) is -3y. So the left side is 6x -3y. On the right, 2*(x) is 2x and 2*(y) is 2y. So right side is 2x + 2y.

Putting it together: 6x -3y = 2x + 2y. Now, I'll get all the x terms on one side and y terms on the other. Let's subtract 2x from both sides: 6x - 2x is 4x, so 4x -3y = 2y. Then, add 3y to both sides: 4x = 5y.

Oh, wait, so 4x equals 5y. So to find the ratio x/y, I can divide both sides by y. That gives 4x/y =5. Then, dividing both sides by 4, x/y =5/4.

Hmm, so x/y is 5/4. Let me check the options. Option D is 5/4, so that should be the answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my steps.

Let me go through the steps again. Starting with (2x - y)/(x + y) = 2/3. Cross-multiplying: 3(2x - y) = 2(x + y). Expanding: 6x -3y = 2x +2y. Subtract 2x: 4x -3y = 2y. Add 3y: 4x =5y. Divide both sides by y: 4x/y=5 â†’ x/y=5/4. Yep, that seems correct.

So the ratio of x to y is 5/4, which is option D.

The problem states that the ratio of \(2x - y\) to \(x + y\) is \(2:3\). Converting this ratio into a fraction gives:

\[
\frac{2x - y}{x + y} = \frac{2}{3}
\]

Cross-multiplying to eliminate the fraction:

\[
3(2x - y) = 2(x + y)
\]

Expanding both sides:

\[
6x - 3y = 2x + 2y
\]

Rearranging terms to isolate \(x\) and \(y\):

\[
6x - 2x = 2y + 3y
\]

Simplifying:

\[
4x = 5y
\]

Dividing both sides by \(y\) to find the ratio \(x:y\):

\[
\frac{x}{y} = \frac{5}{4}
\]

Thus, the ratio of \(x\) to \(y\) is \(\frac{5}{4}\), which corresponds to option D.
