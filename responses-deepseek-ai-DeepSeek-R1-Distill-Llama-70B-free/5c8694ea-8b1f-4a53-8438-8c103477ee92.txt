Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Doppler width of the hydrogen H-alpha line in a discharge tube. Hmm, I remember that the Doppler width has to do with the broadening of spectral lines due to the motion of atoms or molecules emitting the light. The temperature of the gas affects this because hotter gases have more kinetic energy, so the atoms move faster, leading to a broader range of wavelengths (or frequencies) observed.

The question gives me the H-alpha line at 6563 Angstroms and a temperature of 200 degrees Celsius. I need to find the Doppler width in both frequency and wavelength units. The options are A through J, each with different values.

Wait, what's the formula for Doppler width again? I think it's something like delta lambda over lambda is proportional to the velocity over the speed of light. Oh right, delta lambda / lambda = v / c, where v is the root mean square velocity of the emitting atoms.

But wait, another approach. I remember the formula for the Doppler width (Δλ) is given by the Doppler effect equation related to thermal motion. The formula is Δλ = (λ0 / c) * sqrt((3 k T)/(M)), where λ0 is the central wavelength, c is speed of light, k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature in Kelvin, and M is the molar mass. Alternatively, sometimes it's expressed using the formula involving the velocity. Oh wait, the velocity here would be the root mean square (rms) speed of the atoms.

Wait, let's get the exact formula right. The Doppler width in wavelength is given by Δλ = (λ^2 / c) * Δν, where Δν is the Doppler shift in frequency. But how do I get Δν? Alternatively, I think the formula using the temperature is:

Δν = (ν0 / c) * sqrt( (3 k T) / (M) )

Since ν0 = c / λ0, substituting that in gives Δν = (c / λ0) / c * sqrt( (3kT)/M ) = sqrt( (3kT)/(M λ0²) ) * c / c? Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the steps here. Let me think again. The standard formula for the Doppler width in frequency is Δν = ν0 * sqrt( (3kT)/(Mc²) ), because ν = c/λ, so Δν/ν0 would be v/c, where v is the thermal velocity.

Wait, the Doppler shift formula is Δλ/λ = v/c, so Δλ = λ * v/c. And the root mean square velocity v for a gas is sqrt(3kT/M), where M is the molar mass. So putting it together, Δλ = λ * sqrt(3kT/M) / c.

But wait, let me double-check the units. M is molar mass in kg/mol, k is J/K, T is in Kelvin. So let me see: the units inside the sqrt would be (J/K * K) / (kg/mol) ) → J/(kg/mol). J is kg m²/s², so that becomes (kg m²/s²) / (kg/mol ) = (m²/s²) * mol. Then sqrt of that would have units of m/s * sqrt(mol). Wait, that doesn't make sense. Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake here. Oh wait, no, M should be in kg per molecule, not per mole. Oh right, because M in the formula is molar mass times Avogadro's number, or perhaps the formula uses atomic mass in kg. Let me clarify.

Wait, the formula for the rms velocity is v = sqrt( (3kT) / m ), where m is the mass of a single molecule. So m = M/(N_A), where M is molar mass in kg/mol and N_A is Avogadro's number. So substituting back, v = sqrt( (3kT N_A) / (M) ). So in the expression for Δλ, we have:

Δλ = λ * v / c = λ * sqrt( (3kT N_A) / (M) ) / c.

Wait, but I think the formula I saw elsewhere is Δλ = (λ / c) * sqrt( (3kT) / (M) ) * something. Maybe I'm mixing up the terms. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula for the Doppler width in terms of frequency and then convert to wavelength.

Another approach: The Doppler width in frequency is given by Δν = (ν / c) * sqrt(3kT/(M)) ), because ν = c/λ, so (1/λ) = ν/c. Wait, but then for Δν, it's (ν / c) * v, where v is the rms speed.

Let me write down all the constants and values.

Given:
λ = 6563 Angstroms = 6563e-10 meters (since 1 Angstrom = 1e-10 m)
Temperature T = 200°C = 473.15 K
M for hydrogen is approximately 1 g/mol. Since M is in kg/mol, that's 0.001 kg/mol. But wait, wait, the mass m per atom is M/(N_A), so m = 0.001 kg/mol / (6.022e23 atoms/mol) ≈ 1.67e-27 kg.

But perhaps it's easier to just plug the numbers into the formula.

Wait, I think the standard formula for Doppler width (Δν) is:

Δν = (ν0 / c) * sqrt( (3 k T) / (M) ) )

But M here is the molar mass in kg·mol⁻¹. So for hydrogen, M = 0.001 kg/mol.

Wait, but let's get the formula correct. Alternatively, I remember that the Doppler width can be calculated using the formula:

Δλ = (λ^2 / c) * sqrt( (3 k T) / (M) ) * (1 / (c)) )

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, using the relation between wavelength and frequency, since c = λ ν, so ν = c/λ. The Doppler shift in frequency is Δν = (ν) * (v/c), where v is the rms velocity.

So let's compute v first. The rms velocity v is sqrt(3kT/m), where m is the mass of a hydrogen atom.

m = M / N_A = (0.001 kg/mol) / (6.022e23 atoms/mol) = 1.6605e-27 kg.

So v = sqrt(3 * k * T / m )

k is Boltzmann's constant, 1.380649e-23 J/K.

Plugging in the values:

v = sqrt( 3 * 1.38e-23 J/K * 473.15 K / 1.66e-27 kg )

Let me compute that step by step.

First, compute the numerator: 3 * 1.38e-23 * 473.15

3 * 1.38e-23 = 4.14e-23

4.14e-23 * 473.15 ≈ 4.14e-23 * 4.73e2 ≈ 4.14 * 4.73 = approx 19.6, so 19.6e-21 = 1.96e-20.

Then divide by m = 1.66e-27 kg:

1.96e-20 / 1.66e-27 ≈ (1.96 / 1.66) * 1e7 ≈ approx 1.18 * 1e7 = 1.18e7.

Now take the square root: sqrt(1.18e7) ≈ 3434 m/s.

Wait, that seems high? Wait, hydrogen atoms at 200 C moving at ~3.4 km/s? Hmm, I think that's plausible.

Now, compute Δν = (ν0 / c) * v.

ν0 = c / λ. λ is 6563 Angstroms = 6563e-10 m.

So ν0 = (3e8 m/s) / (6563e-10 m) ≈ 3e8 / 6.563e-7 = approx 4.57e14 Hz.

Then Δν = (4.57e14 Hz) / (3e8 m/s) ) * 3434 m/s.

Wait, (4.57e14) / (3e8) = approx 1.523e6 Hz.

Multiply by 3434 m/s (but wait, the units would be (Hz * s/m) * m/s) → Hz.)

Wait, let me compute:

(4.57e14 Hz) * 3434 m/s / (3e8 m/s) )

So 4.57e14 * 3434 = approx 1.57e18, then divided by 3e8 gives approx 5.23e9 Hz.

Wait, wait, let me calculate more accurately:

First, 4.57e14 * 3434 ≈ 4.57e14 * 3.434e3 = 4.57 * 3.434 = approx 15.71, so 15.71e17 = 1.571e18.

Divide by 3e8: 1.571e18 / 3e8 ≈ 5.23e9 Hz.

So Δν ≈ 5.23e9 Hz.

But looking at the options, the frequency parts are:

Option A: 3.58e9 Hz

Option C:7.17e9

Option F:7.17e9

Option I:7.17e9

Hmm, my calculation got approx 5.23e9, which isn't exactly matching any of these. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact values instead of approximating.

Let me recalculate v more accurately.

v = sqrt(3kT/m)

k = 1.380649e-23 J/K

T = 473.15 K

m = (0.001 kg/mol) / (6.02214076e23 mol⁻¹) ) = 1.66053906660e-27 kg.

So 3kT = 3 * 1.380649e-23 * 473.15

3 * 1.380649e-23 = 4.141947e-23

4.141947e-23 * 473.15 = let's compute that.

473.15 * 4.141947e-23 = 

473.15 ≈ 4.7315e2.

So 4.7315e2 * 4.141947e-23 = 4.7315 * 4.141947 = approx 19.6, so 19.6e-21 = 1.96e-20.

Wait, wait, 4.7315e2 * 4.141947e-23 = (4.7315 * 4.141947) * 1e2 * 1e-23 = 19.6 * 1e-21 = 1.96e-20.

Then, 3kT = 1.96e-20 J.

Divide by m: 1.96e-20 / 1.6605e-27 = approx (1.96 / 1.6605) ) * 1e7.

1.96 / 1.6605 ≈ 1.1805.

So 1.1805e7 m²/s².

v = sqrt(1.1805e7) = approx 3434 m/s. So same as before.

Then Δν = (ν0 / c) * v.

ν0 = c / λ = 3e8 m/s / 6563e-10 m.

Compute 6563e-10 meters = 6.563e-7 meters.

So ν0 = 3e8 / 6.563e-7 = Let's compute this exactly.

3e8 / 6.563e-7 = 3 / 6.563 * 1e15 = (0.457) * 1e15 ≈ 4.57e14 Hz.

So Δν = (4.57e14 Hz) * 3434 m/s / (3e8 m/s)

Compute 4.57e14 * 3434 = 4.57 * 3434 = let's compute 4 *3434=13736, 0.57*3434≈1957. So 13736 + 1957 ≈ 15693. So 1.5693e4 * 1e14 → 1.5693e18.

Now divide by 3e8:

1.5693e18 / 3e8 = 5.231e9 Hz.

So Δν ≈ 5.23e9 Hz.

Looking at the options, none of them have 5.23e9 Hz. The closest is option F, which has 7.17e9 Hz, option C also 7.17e9, and option A 3.58e9.

Hmm, so maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula for the Doppler width is Δν = (sqrt(3) ν0) / (c) * sqrt( (k T) / (M) )

Wait, wait, perhaps I should use the formula Δν = ν0 * sqrt( (3kT)/(M c²) )

Wait, let me rederive it. The Doppler effect is Δλ/λ = v/c. So Δλ = λ v/c.

And since ν = c/λ, Δν/ν = v/c ⇒ Δν = ν v/c.

So Δν = (c/λ) * (v/c) ) = v/(λ) * (c/ c) )? Wait, no, that's confusing. Wait, v is the velocity, so:

Δν = ν * (v/c) = (c/λ) * (v/c) ) = v/(λ).

Wait, that can't be right because the units wouldn't match. Let me think in terms of units.

ν is Hz (1/s), v is m/s, c is m/s.

v/c is dimensionless. So Δν = ν * (v/c), which is in Hz.

So yes, Δν = ν * v/c.

Wait, let me compute it that way.

ν = 4.57e14 Hz.

v = 3434 m/s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

So v/c = 3434 / 3e8 ≈ 1.1447e-5.

So Δν = 4.57e14 Hz * 1.1447e-5 ≈ 5.23e9 Hz.

Same as before. So that's correct.

Now, perhaps the problem expects me to use the approximation for the Doppler width in wavelength, and then convert to frequency.

Wait, the question asks for the Doppler width in both frequency and wavelength units. So I need to compute both Δν and Δλ.

I have Δν ≈5.23e9 Hz.

Now compute Δλ.

Δλ = λ * v/c = 6563e-10 m * 3434 m/s / 3e8 m/s.

Wait, 3434 /3e8 = approx 1.1447e-5.

So Δλ = 6563e-10 m * 1.1447e-5 = 6563 * 1.1447e-15 meters.

Compute 6563 * 1.1447 ≈ 6563 * 1 ≈ 6563, 6563 * 0.1447 ≈ 950. So total approx 7513e-15 m, which is 7.513e-12 meters, or 0.007513 Angstroms. Wait, that seems really small.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because 6563 Angstroms is 6.563e-7 meters. So let me recalculate:

Δλ = (6.563e-7 m) * (3434 m/s) / (3e8 m/s)

So (6.563e-7 m) * (3434 / 3e8 )

3434 /3e8 = approx 0.0011447.

So 6.563e-7 * 0.0011447 = 6.563e-7 * 1.1447e-3 = (6.563 * 1.1447) e-10.

6.563 * 1.1447 ≈ let's compute 6 * 1.1447 = 6.868, 0.563 * 1.1447≈0.645, total ≈7.513.

So 7.513e-10 m = 0.7513 Angstroms? Wait, wait, no. Wait, 1e-10 m is 1 Angstrom, so 7.513e-10 m is 0.7513 Angstroms? That can't be right because that's a huge Doppler width. Wait, no, wait, no, wait, no. Wait, 6.563e-7 meters is 6563 Angstroms. So 6.563e-7 m is 6563 Angstroms. When I multiply by 3434 /3e8, I get the Doppler width in meters.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

6.563e-7 m * (3434 /3e8) = 6.563e-7 * (3434 / 3e8)

Compute 3434/3e8 = 3434 / 300,000,000 = 0.011446666...

So 6.563e-7 * 0.011446666 ≈ 6.563e-7 * 0.011446666.

Compute 6.563 * 0.011446666 ≈ 0.07513.

So 0.07513e-7 meters = 7.513e-9 meters = 7.513e-3 Angstroms (since 1e-10 m is 1 Angstrom). So 7.513e-3 Angstroms is 0.00751 Angstroms.

Wait, that's 0.0075 Angstroms, which is 0.0075 Å. Looking at the options, let's see which have this.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0.0515 Å and 3.58e9 Hz

Option C: 0.103 Å and 7.17e9 Hz

Option F:1.03 Å and 7.17e9 Hz

Wait, none of these match 0.0075 Å and 5.23e9 Hz. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait another approach. Maybe the formula
