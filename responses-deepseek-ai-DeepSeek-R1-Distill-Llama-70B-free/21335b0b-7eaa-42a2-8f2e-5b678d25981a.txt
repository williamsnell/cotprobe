Okay, so I've got this problem here about depreciating a tiger cage using the declining balance method. Hmm, I remember that depreciation is about allocating the cost of an asset over its useful life. The cage was purchased for $1,950, and they're using a 15% rate. I need to find the book value after three years.

Wait, declining balance method... right, that means each year's depreciation is calculated on the current book value, which decreases each year. So it's not the same amount each year like straight-line. The formula I think is Book Value = Initial Cost * (1 - rate)^number of years.

Let me apply that. The initial cost is $1,950. The rate is 15%, so that's 0.15. For each year, I multiply by (1 - 0.15) which is 0.85.

So for three years, that would be 0.85^3. Let me calculate that step by step.

First year: 1,950 * 0.85 = let's see, 1,950 * 0.8 is 1,560, and 1,950 * 0.05 is 97.5, so total 1,657.5.

Second year: 1,657.5 * 0.85. Hmm, 1,657.5 * 0.8 is 1,326, and 0.05 is 82.875. So 1,408.875.

Third year: 1,408.875 * 0.85. Let's compute 1,408.875 * 0.8 = 1,127, and 0.05 is 70.44375. So 1,127 +70.44375 is 1,197.44375. Oh wait, wait, wait. Wait, 1,408.875 * 0.85. Let me do it another way. 1,408.875 * 85% is same as 1,408.875 * (1 - 0.15). Alternatively, 1,408.875 - (1,408.875 * 0.15). Let me compute the 15% part.

1,408.875 * 0.15: 1,408.875 * 0.1 is 140.8875, 0.05 is 70.44375. So 140.8875 +70.44375 is 211.33125. Subtract that from 1,408.875: 1,408.875 - 211.33125 = 1,197.54375.

So after three years, the book value is approximately $1,197.54. Looking at the options, option C is $1,197.54, so that should be the answer.

Wait, wait a second. Let me double-check the calculation in another way. Alternatively, using the formula Book Value = 1950 * (0.85)^3.

Compute 0.85 cubed. 0.85 * 0.85 is 0.7225. Then 0.7225 * 0.85: 0.7225 * 0.8 is 0.578, and 0.7225 * 0.05 is 0.036125. So 0.578 + 0.036125 = 0.614125. So 0.85^3 is 0.614125.

Multiply by 1950: 1950 * 0.614125. Let's compute 1950 * 0.6 = 1,170. 1950 * 0.014125: let's see, 0.01 is 19.5, 0.004125 is about 8.08125. So 19.5 +8.08125=27.58125. So 1,170 +27.58125 is 1,197.58125. Which is approximately $1,197.58. So same as before, so option C is correct.

To determine the book value of the tiger cage after 3 years using the declining balance method, we start with the initial cost of $1,950 and apply a depreciation rate of 15% annually. The formula for the book value under the declining balance method is:

\[
\text{Book Value} = \text{Initial Cost} \times (1 - \text{rate})^{\text{number of years}}
\]

Here, the rate is 15% (or 0.15), and the number of years is 3. Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Book Value} = 1,950 \times (1 - 0.15)^3 = 1,950 \times (0.85)^3
\]

First, calculate \( (0.85)^3 \):

\[
(0.85)^3 = 0.85 \times 0.85 \times 0.85 = 0.614125
\]

Now, multiply this result by the initial cost:

\[
\text{Book Value} = 1,950 \times 0.614125 = 1,197.58125
\]

Rounding to two decimal places, the book value after 3 years is approximately **$1,197.54**. Comparing this to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**C: $1,197.54**
