Okay, so I've got this math problem here: I need to find the sum of all integer solutions to the inequality |n| < |n-3| < 9. Hmm, that looks a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that absolute value inequalities can often be split into different cases. So let's tackle each part separately. The inequality has two parts: |n| < |n-3| and |n-3| < 9. I'll start by solving each part and then find the intersection of the solutions.

Starting with the second part, |n-3| < 9. I know that |x| < a means that -a < x < a. So applying that here, this inequality becomes -9 < n-3 < 9. To solve for n, I'll add 3 to all parts: -9 +3 < n < 9 +3, which simplifies to -6 < n < 12. So n must be greater than -6 and less than 12.

Now for the first part: |n| < |n-3|. This is a bit more complex because it involves two absolute values. I think squaring both sides might help since the square of an absolute value is the square of the original number. So let's square both sides: (|n|)^2 < (|n-3|)^2. That simplifies to n² < (n-3)².

Expanding the right side: n² < n² -6n +9. Now, subtract n² from both sides to get 0 < -6n +9. Then, subtract 9: -9 < -6n. Divide both sides by -6, but wait, when I divide by a negative number, I have to reverse the inequality sign. So that gives me 9/6 > n, which simplifies to 3/2 > n or n < 1.5.

Putting it all together: from the first inequality, n < 1.5, and from the second inequality, n is between -6 and 12. So combining these, the solution for n is -6 < n < 1.5.

But wait, the problem asks for integer solutions. So which integers satisfy -6 < n < 1.5? Let me list them: n can be -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1. Are there any more? Let's see: 1.5 is the upper limit, so 1 is included, but 2 is above 1.5, so it's excluded. Similarly, -6 is excluded because n has to be greater than -6.

Now, I need to find the sum of all these integers. Let me add them up: (-5) + (-4) + (-3) + (-2) + (-1) + 0 + 1.

Calculating step by step:
-5 + (-4) = -9
-9 + (-3) = -12
-12 + (-2) = -14
-14 + (-1) = -15
-15 + 0 = -15
-15 +1 = -14.

So the sum is -14. Looking at the options, option F is -14. That must be the answer.

But wait, let me double-check. Did I include all the integers correctly? Let's count them: from -5 to 1 inclusive. That's 7 numbers: -5,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1. Yep, that's correct. And the sum does add up to -14. So I think I'm confident with that.

To solve the inequality \( |n| < |n-3| < 9 \), we break it into two parts and analyze each separately:

1. **Solving \( |n-3| < 9 \):**  
   This inequality can be rewritten as \( -9 < n-3 < 9 \). Adding 3 to all parts gives \( -6 < n < 12 \).

2. **Solving \( |n| < |n-3| \):**  
   Squaring both sides, we get \( n^2 < (n-3)^2 \). Expanding and simplifying:  
   \[
   n^2 < n^2 - 6n + 9 \implies 0 < -6n + 9 \implies -9 < -6n \implies n < \frac{3}{2}.
   \]

Combining the two results, we find \( -6 < n < 1.5 \). Since \( n \) must be an integer, the possible values are \( n = -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1 \).

The sum of these integers is:  
\[
(-5) + (-4) + (-3) + (-2) + (-1) + 0 + 1 = -14.
\]

Thus, the sum of all integer solutions is \(-14\), which corresponds to option **F**.
