Question:

Police officers had probable cause to believe that drug dealing was routinely taking place in a particular room at a local motel. The motel manager authorized the officers to enter the room and provided them with a passkey. Without obtaining a warrant, the officers knocked on the room's door, announced their presence, and told the occupants that they would like to speak with them. The officers then heard yelling and repeated flushing of the toilet. They then used the passkey and entered the room, where they saw the occupants dumping drugs into the toilet. The occupants of the room were charged with drug dealing and have moved to suppress the drugs. Should the court grant the motion to suppress?

Options:

A: No, because the sound of flushing toilet provided sufficient reason for immediate entry.
B: Yes, because the motel manager did not have the authority to consent to the officers' entry.
C: Yes, because the officers did not have a search warrant.
D: Yes, because the officers cannot benefit from exigent circumstances that they created.
E: No, because exigent circumstances justified the officers' entry.
F: Yes, because the officers should have waited for the occupants to open the door.
G: No, because the occupants were actively destroying evidence.
H: Yes, because exigent circumstances cannot excuse the lack of a warrant.
I: No, because the motel manager consented to the officers' entry.
J: No, because the officers had probable cause to enter the room.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this Fourth Amendment question about the exclusionary rule and whether the evidence should be suppressed. Let me start by breaking down the facts.

So, the police officers had probable cause to believe that drug dealing was happening in a specific motel room. The motel manager gave them a passkey and authorized them to enter the room. They didn't get a warrant. They knocked, announced themselves, and told the occupants they wanted to talk. Then they heard yelling and flushing toilets. That's when they used the passkey to enter. Inside, they saw drugs being dumped into the toilet, leading to charges against the occupants, who are now moving to suppress the evidence.

The question is whether the court should grant the motion to suppress. So, I need to think about the legal principles here.

First, I remember that under the Fourth Amendment, searches and seizures need a warrant unless an exception applies. One key exception is consent. If a person with authority consents to the search, it's valid. Here, the motel manager gave consent and a passkey. But wait, does the manager have authority to consent to the officers entering the room? Generally, a hotel manager can consent to searches of rooms because they retain a master key and the right to enter in case of emergencies or for maintenance. So, the manager's consent might be valid. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the case here, especially if the guests are still present and using the room.

Another exception is exigent circumstances, which allows warrantless searches when there's an emergency or the risk of evidence destruction. In this case, the officers heard the toilet flushing, which indicates the occupants were trying to get rid of evidence. That sounds like exigent circumstances because the destruction of evidence was imminent.

Wait, but did the officers create the exigent circumstances themselves? Like, they knocked and announced, which might have prompted the occupants to flush the toilet. I remember a case called Kentucky v. King, where the Supreme Court said that if the police create an exigency by their own actions (like knocking and announcing in a way that causes the occupants to panic), then they can't rely on exigent circumstances. But in this case, the officers just knocked and announced. They didn't do anything more like breaking the door or anything. So maybe they didn't create the exigency.

So, the officers had probable cause (they believed drug dealing was happening), and when they heard the flushing, that gave them an exigent circumstance to enter without a warrant. So, the entry was justified, and the evidence shouldn't be suppressed.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the sound of flushing provided sufficient reason. That's part of the exigent circumstances.

Option B says the manager didn't have authority. I think the manager did have authority, so B is incorrect.

Option C says they needed a warrant. But if exigent circumstances apply, they don't need one. So C is wrong.

Option D says officers can't benefit from exigent circumstances they created. If the court finds that the officers caused the exigency, then D would apply. But as I thought earlier, just knocking and announcing might not count as creating the exigency. So maybe D isn't the right reason here.

Option E says exigent circumstances justified the entry. That aligns with what I was thinking.

Option F says they should have waited. But if there's an emergency, waiting isn't required.

Option G says occupants were destroying evidence. That's true, but the question is whether the entry was lawful.

Option H says exigent circumstances can't excuse. That's not correct because exigent circumstances are an exception.

Option I says the manager consented. While that's a point, the main issue is whether the consent was sufficient or if exigent circumstances applied. The manager's consent might allow entry, but the officers also had probable cause and an exigency.

Option J says they had probable cause, but probable cause alone without a warrant or exception isn't enough. They need either a warrant or an exception.

So, putting it all together: the officers had probable cause, the manager's consent, and exigent circumstances (destruction of evidence). But the key issue is whether the consent was valid and whether the exigent circumstances justified the warrantless entry.

Wait, another angle: if the manager's consent was valid, then the officers didn't need a warrant. But if the manager couldn't consent, then they need another exception.

I think the manager can consent because they have the right to enter the room. So, in that case, the entry would be lawful under the consent exception, but in this scenario, the officers used the passkey only after hearing the flushing. So, maybe the initial consent is enough, but the timing is after the knocking.

Alternatively, the initial plan was to get consent, but when they heard the flushing, they used the passkey. So, the entry was based on both consent and exigent circumstances.

But the problem here is that the officers were already at the door and announced themselves. If the occupants, upon hearing the police, started flushing, the question is whether the police can then enter under exigent circumstances without a warrant.

In Kentucky v. King, the court held that police can't create their own exigency. So, if the police knock, announce, and the occupants start destroying evidence, that's not an exigency created by the police, so they can enter. So, the entry would be valid.

So, the correct answer would be E: No, because exigent circumstances justified the officers' entry.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A says the sound of flushing provided sufficient reason, which is part of exigent circumstances. So, which is better, A or E?

Option E is broader, stating that exigent circumstances justified the entry. So E is correct.

But wait, another thought: Did the officers have probable cause before entering? They had probable cause to believe drug dealing was happening, which is enough. Then, when they heard the flushing, which indicated destruction of evidence, that's exigent circumstances. So, the combination of probable cause and exigent circumstances allows the warrantless entry.

So, the court shouldn't suppress the evidence. Therefore, the answer should be E.

The question revolves around whether the court should grant the motion to suppress evidence obtained by police officers who entered a motel room without a warrant. The officers had probable cause to believe drug dealing was occurring in the room, and the motel manager provided consent and a passkey. After knocking and announcing their presence, the officers heard yelling and repeated flushing of the toilet, which indicated the destruction of evidence. They then used the passkey to enter the room and observed drugs being dumped into the toilet.

Key legal principles include the Fourth Amendment's requirement of a warrant for searches and seizures, with exceptions such as consent and exigent circumstances. The motel manager's consent is likely valid because managers generally have authority to consent to room entries. However, the officers' actions after hearing the flushing toilet implicate the exigent circumstances exception, which allows warrantless entry when there is an imminent risk of evidence destruction.

The Supreme Court's decision in *Kentucky v. King* clarifies that police may rely on exigent circumstances if they do not create the emergency themselves. Here, the officers' knocking and announcing their presence did not create the exigency; the occupants' reaction of flushing the toilet constituted an imminent destruction of evidence. Thus, the officers' entry was justified under exigent circumstances.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: While the flushing toilet provided evidence of destruction, this is part of the broader exigent circumstances justification.
- **B**: Incorrect because the motel manager likely had authority to consent.
- **C**: Incorrect because exigent circumstances excuse the need for a warrant.
- **D**: Incorrect because the officers did not create the exigency.
- **E**: Correct, as exigent circumstances justified the warrantless entry.
- **F**: Incorrect because exigent circumstances allow immediate entry without waiting.
- **G**: While true, this does not address the legality of the entry.
- **H**: Incorrect because exigent circumstances are a valid exception to the warrant requirement.
- **I**: While the manager's consent is relevant, the key issue is the applicability of exigent circumstances.
- **J**: Incorrect because probable cause alone does not justify warrantless entry without an exception.

The correct answer is **E**, as exigent circumstances justified the officers' entry. 

Answer: E
