Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the uncertainty in the energy of an excited state of an atom or molecule. Hmm, I remember from my notes that this has something to do with the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. Right, the principle relates the uncertainty in energy and the uncertainty in time. The formula, I think, is ΔE * Δt ≈ ħ/2 or maybe ħ. Wait, wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact expression.

So the problem states that the lifetime of the excited state is 10^-9 seconds. They're asking for the uncertainty in the energy of this state. I think the formula I need is ΔE Δt ≈ ħ/(2π) or maybe ħ times some factor. Oh wait, I've heard two versions: one where it's ħ and another where it's ħ/(2π). I'm a bit confused about which one applies here.

Let me think. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle says that ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. So the minimum uncertainty is ħ/(2). But sometimes people approximate it as ΔE Δt ≈ ħ. So which one do I use in this problem?

Wait, I remember that in the context of the lifetime of an excited state, the energy uncertainty ΔE is roughly on the order of ħ divided by the lifetime. So probably, the formula to use is ΔE ≈ ħ / Δt. Because Δt is the lifetime, which is the characteristic time for the state to decay.

So the Planck constant ħ is 1.0545718e-34 J·s. The lifetime Δt is 1e-9 seconds. Let me plug in the numbers.

ΔE = ħ / Δt = (1.0545718e-34 J·s) / (1e-9 s) = 1.0545718e-25 J. Oh wait, that's approximately 1e-25 J. Looking at the options, option J is 1e-25 J. But wait, the options are a bit different.

Wait, let me double-check the formula. Another source I remember says that the relation is ΔE Δt ≈ ħ. So using ΔE = ħ / Δt would give the same result as before. So 1e-34 / 1e-9 is 1e-25 J. So that's about 1e-25 J.

Looking at the options, option J is 1e-25 J. But wait, I thought maybe I should have used ħ/(2π), which would be h-bar. Let me calculate that. If I use ΔE = ħ/(2π Δt), no, that doesn't make sense. Wait, the uncertainty principle is often written as ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/(2). So the minimum uncertainty is ħ/(2), meaning ΔE ≥ ħ/(2Δt).

Wait, so perhaps the correct formula is ΔE ≈ ħ/(2Δt). Because I think the inequality is ΔE Δt ≥ ħ/2. So solving for ΔE gives ΔE ≥ ħ/(2Δt). So in that case, let's compute that.

So if Δt is 1e-9 s, then ΔE ≈ (1.05e-34 J·s) / (2 * 1e-9 s) ) = (1.05e-34) / (2e-9) = 5.25e-26 J. Wait, that's 5.25e-26 J. But none of the options have that. Hmm, perhaps I got the formula wrong again.

Wait, maybe the relation is written as ΔE = ħ * ln(2) / Δt, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the reduced Planck constant h-bar equal to h/(2π), which is about 1.05e-34 J·s as I said before. So if the formula is ΔE Δt ≈ h-bar, then ΔE is h-bar over Δt.

So h-bar is 1.0545718e-34 J·s divided by 1e-9 s gives 1.05e-25 J. Which is approximately 1e-25 J. So that's option J.

But looking back at the options, option E is 5e-25 J. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another possibility: sometimes, the relation is presented as ΔE ≈ ħ / (Δt * 2π). Because sometimes the uncertainty principle is written with a factor of 2π. So let's calculate that. So ħ is 1.05e-34, and 2π is about 6.28. So 1.05e-34 / (6.28 * 1e-9) = approx 1.67e-26 J, which is 1.67e-26, which is 0.167e-25, which is 1.67 x10^-26. None of the options have that either.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the exact formula. Let me think about the exact expression. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle states that ΔE Δt ≥ (ħ/2). So the minimum uncertainty is when ΔE equals ħ/(2Δt). So that would be (1.05e-34) / (2 *1e-9) )= 5.25e-25 J? Wait, 1.05e-34 divided by 2e-9 is (1.05 / 2 )e-25, which is 0.525e-25, which is 5.25e-26 J.

Wait, that's 5.25e-26 J. But that's not matching any of the options. Let me check the calculation again. 1e-9 is 10^-9. So 1e-34 / 1e-9 = 1e-25. So without the 2, it's 1e-25. With the 2, it's 0.5e-25 or 5e-26.

Hmm, perhaps the question is using the approximation without the factor of 2. So maybe they're just using ΔE = ħ / Δt. So 1e-34 /1e-9 = 1e-25, which is option J.

But wait, the options don't have 1e-25 except for option J (1e-25 J). So that must be the correct answer.

But wait, looking again at the options, option E is 5e-25 J. Perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate.

Wait, no, 1e-34 divided by 1e-9 is 1e-25. So that's 1e-25 J, which is option J.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the formula ΔE = h/(2π Δt), where h is Planck's constant. Because sometimes h is used, not ħ. So h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

So if that's the case, then h/(2π Δt) = (6.626e-34) / (6.283 * 1e-9) )= approx 6.626e-34 /6.283e-9 = approx 1.055e-25 J, which again brings us back to 1e-25 J.

Wait, that's the same as the previous approach. So again, the answer would be option J.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused because in some derivations, the energy-time uncertainty is written as ΔE Δt ≈ ħ. So without the 2, so the same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the use of the reduced Planck constant and the formula without any additional factors, so ΔE = ħ / Δt. That would be 1.05e-34 / 1e-9 = 1.05e-25 J, which is approximately 1e-25 J, option J.

So considering all this, I think the correct answer is J: 1e-25 J.

The problem involves calculating the uncertainty in the energy of an excited state of an atom or molecule using the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. The lifetime of the excited state is given as \( \Delta t = 10^{-9} \, \mathrm{s} \). The relevant formula from the uncertainty principle is:

\[
\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}
\]

Rearranging for \( \Delta E \), we get:

\[
\Delta E \geq \frac{\hbar}{2 \Delta t}
\]

Here, \( \hbar \) (reduced Planck constant) is approximately \( 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \mathrm{J \cdot s} \). Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-9}} = 5.27 \times 10^{-26} \, \mathrm{J}
\]

However, the problem seems to simplify the calculation by using the approximation \( \Delta E \approx \frac{\hbar}{\Delta t} \), without the factor of 2. This gives:

\[
\Delta E = \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{10^{-9}} = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-25} \, \mathrm{J}
\]

This result is approximately \( 1 \times 10^{-25} \, \mathrm{J} \), which matches option J. The other options, such as \( 5 \times 10^{-25} \, \mathrm{J} \) (option E), do not align with this calculation. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**J: \( 1 \times 10^{-25} \, \mathrm{J} \)**
