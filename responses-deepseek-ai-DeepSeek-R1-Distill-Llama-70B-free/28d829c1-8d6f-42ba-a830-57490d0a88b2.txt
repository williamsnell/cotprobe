Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about accounting for acquisition costs. Let me break it down step by step.

The question is about Bale Co. incurring $100,000 of acquisition costs related to the purchase of Dixon Co.'s net assets. I need to figure out how these costs should be treated according to accounting principles.

First, I remember that acquisition costs, sometimes called acquisition-related costs, are expenses that a company incurs when it's buying another company or assets. These costs can include things like legal fees, due diligence costs, and other expenses related to the acquisition.

I think about the different methods of accounting for acquisitions. There's the purchase method, which I believe is part of GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles), but I'm not entirely sure. Under the purchase method, the acquiring company records the assets they acquire at their fair market value. But what about the costs related to the acquisition?

Wait, I think I remember that under GAAP, acquisition costs are expensed as incurred. That means they are not capitalized as assets; instead, they are treated as expenses in the period they occur. So, for example, if a company spends money on legal fees to buy another company, those fees are written off immediately as an expense rather than being spread out over time or included in the cost of the assets purchased.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Treat as a separate asset and depreciate. No, because acquisition costs are not considered assets. They are expensed.

Option B: Capitalize as goodwill and test for impairment. Hmm, goodwill is an intangible asset that arises when the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the net assets. But acquisition costs themselves are separate and are expensed, not part of goodwill.

Option C: Capitalize as part of the cost of investment. I'm not sure about this one. If the company was purchasing an investment, like buying stocks, maybe some costs could be capitalized. But in this case, it's the purchase of net assets, so this might not apply.

Option D: Expensed as incurred in the subsequent period. Wait, the subsequent period after what? If they're incurred now, they should be expensed now, not in the next period. So maybe not D.

Option E: Allocated on a pro rata basis to monetary assets. Pro rata allocation applies to things like discounts or premiums on bonds, not acquisition costs. So E doesn't seem right.

Option F: Capitalized as part of inventory. No, that doesn't make sense. Acquisition costs aren't part of inventory; they're separate expenses.

Option G: Capitalized as other asset and amortized. No, because again, these costs are expensed, not capitalized.

Option H: Expensed over five years. That would be like deferred expense, but I think GAAP says to expense them immediately, not over time.

Option I: Expensed as incurred in the current period. This matches what I was thinking earlier. The costs are recognized as expenses when they happen, in the current period.

Option J: Allocated to nonmonetary assets. Acquisition costs aren't allocated to the assets; they're expensed. So J is out.

So the correct answer should be I: Expensed as incurred in the current period.

Wait, just to make sure. Let me recap. Acquisition costs are not part of the cost of the assets acquired. They are separate and expensed when incurred. So yes, I is correct.

The correct answer is:

I: Expensed as incurred in the current period.

Acquisition costs, such as legal fees and due diligence expenses, are expensed as incurred under GAAP and are not capitalized as assets. They are recognized as expenses in the period they are incurred.

Answer: I
