Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Ancestral Pueblo elites and how their power emerged according to one theory. Let me try to work through this step by step.

First, I remember that the Ancestral Pueblo people, also known as the Anasazi, were part of the Four Corners region in the southwestern United States. They're known for their cliff dwellings and multi-story structures. But the question is about the emergence of power among their elites.

The options are A through J. I need to think about each option and see which one fits the theory.

Option A: created intricate pottery and jewelry. Pottery and jewelry might be signs of a developed culture, but I'm not sure if that directly ties to the elites' power. It could be more about craftsmanship rather than control or authority.

Option B: discovered the use of fire. Wait, fire was discovered way back, like in the Paleolithic era. The Ancestral Pueblo people were around much later, so this doesn't make sense. They didn't discover fire; it was already known.

Option C: invented the wheel. Hmm, the wheel was invented in Mesopotamia around 4000-3500 BCE. The Ancestral Pueblo were around from about 2000 BCE to 1300 CE. But I don't think they used the wheel much. Their main transportation was without wheels, maybe using drag sleds. Plus, the wheel isn't directly linked to elite power in this context.

Option D: stored food surpluses in good years for distribution in bad years. Oh, that sounds familiar. Elites often control resources. If they stored food, they could distribute it during hard times, making people dependent on them. That would give them power. I think this is a common theory about how elites riseâ€”controlling resources and aid.

Option E: established trade routes with distant cultures. Trade can bring wealth and power, but does that directly tie to the emergence of elites? Maybe, but I'm not sure if this is the primary factor here. It could be a supporting factor but perhaps not the main one.

Option F: constructed monuments and elaborate multi-storied cliff dwellings. Building big structures might show off their power, but does that explain how they got power in the first place? I think the building comes after they have power. So maybe this isn't the cause but a result.

Option G: introduced advanced farming techniques. Better farming could lead to more food, which might support a surplus. But if the elites introduced the techniques, maybe they controlled the food production. That could tie into option D as well. So maybe storing surpluses is part of having advanced farming.

Option H: predicted astronomical events. Knowing eclipses and such could give a group religious or spiritual authority. That's plausible. Shamans or leaders who can predict events might be seen as powerful. I've heard theories about leaders using astronomical knowledge to maintain control.

Option I: incorporated other societies through conquest warfare. Conquest would definitely give power, but I'm not sure if Ancestral Pueblo elites are known for this. I think they were more about building and trade rather than conquest. But I'm not certain.

Option J: developed a written language. Written language is a big step, but I don't think the Ancestral Pueblo had a written language. They did have symbols and petroglyphs, but not a full writing system. So this might not be the case.

Now, considering all these, the options that stand out are D, E, F, G, H, and I. Let's narrow it down.

The question is about the theory where elites emerged when certain groups did something. So the key is what action caused their power.

Option D: Storing food. If they can control food distribution, they can exert power, especially in times of scarcity. This makes sense as a way to centralize authority.

Option H: Predicting astronomical events. This could also be a source of power, as people might see them as having divine knowledge or connections.

I'm a bit torn between D and H. Which one is more likely according to theories?

I remember that in many early societies, control of resources like food was a major factor in the rise of elites. For example, in Mesopotamia, the ability to manage grain surpluses and distribute them during famines gave power to certain groups.

Also, in the case of Chaco Canyon, which was a major site for Ancestral Puebloans, there's evidence of a system where food and goods were stored and redistributed. The elites might have controlled these storage sites, allowing them to influence others.

So option D seems more aligned with that theory.

Option H, predicting astronomical events, is more about religious or ideological power. While that's possible, I think the resource control is a more direct way elites emerge.

So the answer should be D.

According to one theory, the power of Ancestral Pueblo elites emerged when certain groups stored food surpluses in good years for distribution in bad years. This practice allowed them to control resources, making people dependent on them during times of scarcity, thereby centralizing authority. While other options, such as predicting astronomical events or constructing monuments, could also contribute to elite power, the storage and redistribution of food surpluses is a more direct and widely recognized factor in the rise of elites in early societies.

Answer: D
