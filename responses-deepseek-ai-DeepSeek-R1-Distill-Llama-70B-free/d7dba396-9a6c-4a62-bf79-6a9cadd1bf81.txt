Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating beta using some given equation and values. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it slow.

The given equation is β equals 2πc times the observed wavenumber (tilde omega_obs) multiplied by the square root of (mu divided by 2D). The formula looks a bit complicated, but I think I can break it down.

First, let's list out the given values. The observed wavenumber, tilde omega_obs, is 2886 cm^-1. Oh wait, and D is given as 440.2 kJ/mol for HCl. I remember that D is the dissociation energy. 

But wait, the units here are a bit tricky. D is in kJ/mol, and I think I'll need it in different units for calculations. Oh right, because when dealing with these equations, especially from spectroscopy or quantum mechanics, the units are usually in terms of ergs or joules per molecule, not per mole. So I probably need to convert that.

So, D is 440.2 kJ/mol. Let's convert that into J/mol first. Multiply by 1000, so that's 440200 J/mol. But wait, to get it per molecule, I need to use Avogadro's number. Avogadro's number is approximately 6.022e23 mol^-1. So I'll multiply 440200 J/mol by 1/mol and divide by Avogadro's number to get per molecule. 

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. So D is in kJ per mole, which is energy per mole. To convert it into energy per molecule, I should multiply by (1 mol / Avogadro's number). So D per molecule would be 440200 J/mol * (1 mol / 6.022e23 molecules) ) = 440200 / 6.022e23 J/molecule.

Wait, but wait. I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me check the units. D is in kJ·mol⁻¹, so 440.2 kJ/mol is 440,200 J/mol. To get it per molecule, divide by Avogadro's number. So yes, that makes it 440200 / 6.022e23 J per molecule.

But wait, the equation uses D in the denominator under a square root. Hmm. Also, the mu is the reduced mass. Oh wait, the equation has mu, but I don't have mu given here. Wait, did I miss that? The problem gives me tilde omega_obs and D, but not mu. Oh wait, wait—maybe mu is the reduced mass of HCl. Oh, right, I think that's correct because it's a diatomic molecule.

So I need to calculate the reduced mass mu for HCl. H is hydrogen, and Cl is chlorine-35. So the atomic masses are approximately: H is about 1 atomic mass unit (amu), and Cl-35 is about 35 amu. The reduced mass mu is (m1 * m2)/(m1 + m2). 

Wait, but wait—those are in amu, and I need to convert them into kilograms for SI units. Because the other constants like c are in m/s. So 1 amu is approximately 1.6605e-27 kg.

So for H, m1 is 1 amu, which is 1.6605e-27 kg. For Cl-35, m2 is 35 amu, so 35 * 1.6605e-27 kg. Let me calculate that:

35 * 1.6605e-27 = 58.1175e-27 kg. Wait, 35 times 1.6605 is 58.1175, so 5.81175e-26 kg? Wait, no. Wait 1.6605e-27 times 35: 35 * 1.6605 = 58.1175, so 58.1175e-27 kg = 5.81175e-26 kg.

So m1 is 1.6605e-27 kg, m2 is 5.81175e-26 kg. So the reduced mass mu is (m1*m2)/(m1 + m2). Let's compute that.

Calculating numerator: m1 * m2 = (1.6605e-27 kg) * (5.81175e-26 kg) = Let me compute that.

Multiply 1.6605e-27 * 5.81175e-26. That's (1.6605 * 5.81175) times 1e-53 (since 10^-27 * 10^-26 = 10^-53). 1.6605 * 5.81175 is approximately let's see: 1.66 * 5.8 is around 9.636, but more accurately: 1.6605 *5.81175.

Let me compute that step by step:

1.6605 * 5 = 8.3025
1.6605 *0.81175 ≈ 1.6605 *0.8 = 1.3284, and 1.6605 *0.01175≈ ~0.0195. So total is approx 8.3025 + 1.3284 + 0.0195 ≈ 9.65.

So the numerator is approximately 9.65e-53 kg².

Now the denominator is m1 + m2 = (1.6605e-27 kg) + (5.81175e-26 kg) = Let's compute that. Well, 5.81175e-26 is the same as 58.1175e-27, so sum is 1.6605e-27 + 58.1175e-27 = 59.778e-27 kg. So 5.9778e-26 kg.

So mu = numerator / denominator = (9.65e-53 kg²) / (5.9778e-26 kg) ) = (9.65 /5.9778 )e-27 kg.

Computing 9.65 /5.9778: Let's see, 5.9778 *1.6 is about 9.56, so approximately 1.62. So mu is approximately 1.62e-27 kg.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation for m1 + m2.

Wait, m1 is 1.6605e-27 kg, m2 is 5.81175e-26 kg. So m2 is 5.81175e-26 = 58.1175e-27 kg. So m1 + m2 is 1.6605e-27 +58.1175e-27 =59.778e-27 kg = 5.9778e-26 kg. Correct.

So mu = (1.6605e-27 *5.81175e-26) / (5.9778e-26) ) = Let's compute the exact value.

Alternatively, let's compute m1*m2/(m1+m2):

m1 = 1.6605e-27 kg, m2 =5.81175e-26 kg.

So m1 * m2 = 1.6605e-27 *5.81175e-26 = 1.6605 *5.81175e-53 = let's compute 1.6605 *5.81175 first.

Calculating 1.6605 *5.81175:

1.6605 *5 =8.3025
1.6605 *0.8=1.3284
1.6605 *0.01175= approx 0.01952
Adding all: 8.3025 +1.3284=9.6309 +0.01952=9.6504.

So 9.6504e-53 kg².

m1 + m2 =5.9778e-26 kg.

So mu = 9.6504e-53 /5.9778e-26 = (9.6504 /5.9778 )e-27 kg.

Calculating 9.6504 /5.9778: Let me compute this division.

5.9778 *1.6 = 9.562, which is a bit less than 9.6504. The difference is 9.6504 -9.562=0.0884.

So 0.0884 /5.9778 ≈ ~0.0148. So the total is 1.6148 approximately.

So mu ≈1.6148e-27 kg.

Wait, but let me use more precise calculations. Maybe I should compute 9.6504 /5.9778.

5.9778 × 1.615 ≈ ?

Well, 5.9778 ×1 =5.9778

5.9778 ×0.6=3.58668 → total 9.5645

5.9778 ×0.015= ~0.08967 → 9.5645+0.08967=9.65417.

Wait, our numerator is 9.6504, which is slightly less than 9.65417. So 1.615 gives 9.65417, which is a bit higher than 9.6504.

So perhaps the exact value is approximately 1.615 - (9.65417-9.6504)/(5.9778 *0.001). Let's compute the difference: 9.65417-9.6504=0.00377.

So 0.00377 /5.9778 ≈ 0.00063. So subtract 0.00063 from 1.615, giving 1.61437.

So mu≈1.61437e-27 kg. I'll just take it as approximately 1.614e-27 kg for the calculation.

Now, back to the main equation:

β = 2πc * tilde_omega_obs * sqrt( mu/(2D) )

Wait, let me make sure I have the equation correctly: it's 2πc multiplied by tilde_omega_obs multiplied by the square root of (mu/(2D)). So yes.

So I need to compute each part step by step.

First, let me note the values I have:

tilde_omega_obs =2886 cm^-1.

But wait, the units for beta will be in m^-1, so I should convert tilde_omega_obs from cm^-1 to m^-1. Because 1 cm^-1 is 100 m^-1. So 2886 cm^-1 is 2886 *100 = 288600 m^-1.

Wait, but wait—no. Wait, beta is in m^-1. So let me make sure about the units.

Wait, the wavenumber tilde_omega is in cm^-1. To convert it to m^-1, since 1 cm is 0.01 m, 1 cm^-1 is 100 m^-1. So yes, 2886 cm^-1 is 2886 * 100 = 288600 m^-1.

So that's the value for tilde_omega_obs in m^-1.

Next, compute the square root term: sqrt( mu/(2D) )

But wait, D is given in kJ/mol, which I need to convert into J/molecule, as I thought earlier.

So D is 440.2 kJ/mol → 440200 J/mol. Then, per molecule, it's 440200 J/mol divided by Avogadro's number (6.022e23 mol^-1), so D = 440200 / 6.022e23 J/molecule.

But wait, let me compute that value.

440200 J/mol = 4.402e5 J/mol.

So D per molecule is (4.402e5 J/mol) / (6.022e23 molecules/mol) ) = 4.402e5 /6.022e23 = approx 7.312e-19 J/molecule.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

4.402e5 /6.022e23 = (4.402 /6.022) *1e(5-23) )= 0.7312 *1e-18 =7.312e-19 J/molecule.

So D =7.312e-19 J/molecule.

Now, mu is 1.614e-27 kg. So mu/(2D) is (1.614e-27 kg) / (2 *7.312e-19 J/molecule).

Wait, but J is kg·m²/s². So I need to make sure the units are compatible. Hmm, actually, in this case, D is given in J per molecule, which is energy per molecule. So when we take the ratio mu/(2D), we have kg / (J/molecule * 2). Wait, but units might not be crucial here as we're taking the square root, but perhaps I should verify.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in units earlier. Let me think again. Because D is in kJ/mol, and when I convert it to per molecule, it's in J/molecule. So D is in J/molecule, mu is in kg, so mu/(2D) would have units of kg/(J/molecule * 2), but that's perhaps not the right way to look at it. Hmm, maybe I should just proceed with the numerical calculation.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the numerical value without worrying too much about the units for now, as long as all the constants are accounted for correctly.

So, mu =1.614e-27 kg.

D=7.312e-19 J/molecule.

So mu/(2D) = (1.614e-27 kg) / (2 *7.312e-19 J/molecule)

Wait, J is kg·m²/s², so the units here would be kg/(kg·m²/s² * molecule^{-1}) ) → (s² * m^-2 * molecule). Hmm, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's just compute the value.

So, compute 1.614e-27 / (2 *7.312e-19) = (1.614e-27) / (1.4624e-18) = (1.614 /1.4624 )e-9.

1.614 /1.4624 ≈ 1.104. So 1.104e-9.

So sqrt(mu/(2D)) = sqrt(1.104e-9) = approx 3.322e-5.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

sqrt(1.104e-9) = (1.104^0.5) * 1e-4.5. Wait, 1e-9 is (1e-4.5)^2. So sqrt(1e-9) is 1e-4.5 = approx 3.162e-5. But since 1.104 is a bit more than 1, the square root is a bit more than 1. So 1.104^0.5 is approx 1.051.

So sqrt(1.104e-9)=1.051 *3.162e-5 ≈ 3.322e-5.

Wait, let me compute 1.104^0.5 more accurately. Let me think: 1.0488^2 is 1.1, so 1.0488 squared is 1.1. Wait, 1.05 squared is 1.1025, which is close to 1.104. So 1.05 squared is 1.1025. 1.05^2 = 1.1025. So 1.104 is 1.1025 +0.0015. So the square root of 1.104 is approximately 1.05 + (0.0015)/(2*1.05) ) → 1.05 + 0.0015/(2.1) ≈ 1.05 + 0.000714 ≈ 1.0507.

So sqrt(1.104)≈1.0507.

Thus, sqrt(1.104e-9)=1.0507e-4.5=1.0507 * 3.162e-5 → 1.0507 *3.162 ≈ 3.323e-5.

So approximately 3.323e-5.

Now, putting it all together.

Beta = 2 * π * c * tilde_omega_obs * sqrt(mu/(2D)).

Let me list the values:

2 * π ≈ 6.2832.

c is the speed of light. In m/s, c ≈ 2.9979e8 m/s.

tilde_omega_obs is 2886 cm^-1 =288600 m^-1.

And the square root term is ~3.323e-5.

So putting it together:

Beta =6.2832 *2.9979e8 m/s * 288600 m^-1 *3.323e-5.

Wait, let me compute each multiplication step by step.

First, compute 2πc: 6.2832 *2.9979e8 = let's calculate that.

6.2832 *3e8 is approximately 1.88496e9, but let me compute accurately:

6.2832 *2.9979e8 = ?

6 *2.9979e8 =1.79874e9.

0.2832 *2.9979e8 = approx 0.2832 *3e8 =8.496e7, but more accurately:

2.9979e8 *0.2832 = (approx) 2.9979e8 *0.28=8.393e7 and 2.9979e8 *0.0032=9.595e5.

Adding: 8.393e7 +9.595e5 = approx 8.482e7.

So total 1.79874e9 +8.482e7 =1.79874e9 +0.08482e9 =1.88356e9 m^-1 s^{-1}? Wait, wait, units: c is m/s, so 2πc would have units m/s. But when multiplied by tilde_omega_obs (in m^-1), the units would be (m/s * m^-1) = s^-1, but that's okay.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed with the calculation numerically.

So 2πc is approx 6.2832 *2.9979e8 = let me compute this exactly.

6.2832 *2.9979e8:

Compute 6 *2.9979e8 =1.79874e9.

0.2832 *2.9979e8 = let's compute 0.2 *2.9979e
