Okay, so I have this problem here about a sailboat and boundary layer thickness. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to remember. 

The sailboat is 100 feet long and moving at 10 feet per second. It's acting as a flat plate, so I think this is a problem about fluid flow over a flat plate, which probably relates to boundary layer theory. The question is asking for the maximum thickness of the boundary layer. 

I remember that the boundary layer thickness depends on the Reynolds number. The formula I recall is something like delta (δ) equals 0.376 times the Reynolds number to the power of -1/2, but wait, was that for laminar flow? Oh right, because the maximum thickness would occur if the entire boundary layer is laminar, but sometimes it's turbulent. But in this case, maybe we just calculate using the formula for the maximum possible, perhaps assuming it's all laminar or just using the standard formula.

Wait, the formula I think is δ = (5 * μ * L) / (ρ * v * sqrt(Re)), or was it something else. Or maybe I should calculate the Reynolds number first. 

Reynolds number Re is (ρ * v * L) / μ. Oh wait, but wait, the units here might be tricky because the viscosity is given in lbm/hr-ft and density in lbm/ft³. I think I need to convert these units to something compatible, maybe to lbm/ft·s or something else.

Let me jot down the given values:

- Length (L) = 100 ft
- Speed (v) = 10 ft/s
- Density (ρ) = 62.4 lbm/ft³
- Viscosity (μ) = 3.0 lbm/hr-ft

Wait, wait. I think the units for viscosity are in lbm/(hr·ft), but in the Reynolds number formula, which uses the kinematic viscosity, I need to make sure the units are consistent. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate everything in consistent units.

Wait, the formula is Re = (ρ * v * L) / μ. But the units for μ are lbm/(hr ft), and the other terms are in lbm/ft³, ft/s, ft. So let's see:

ρ is in lbm/ft³, v is ft/s, L is ft, so numerator is (lbm/ft³) * (ft/s) * ft = lbm/s.

Denominator μ is lbm/(hr ft). So Re would have units (lbm/s) / (lbm/(hr ft)) )= (lbm/s) * (hr ft)/lbm )= (ft * hr)/s.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. I must have messed up the units somewhere. Let me think again.

Wait, the correct formula is Re = (v * L) / ν, where ν is the kinematic viscosity. And ν is μ/ρ. So maybe I can compute ν first.

ν = μ / ρ. But μ is given in lbm/(hr ft), and ρ is lbm/ft³. So ν would be (lbm/(hr ft)) / (lbm/ft³) ) = (ft³) / (hr ft) ) = ft²/(hr). 

Wait, wait, more accurately: (lbm/(hr·ft)) ÷ (lbm/ft³) ) = (1/(hr·ft)) * ft³ = (ft²)/(hr). So ν is in ft² per hour.

But I need ν in ft² per second because the velocity is in ft/s. So I should convert ν to ft²/s.

Since 1 hour is 3600 seconds, so ν = (ft²/hr) = (ft²) / (3600 s). So to get ν in ft²/s, I can write ν = μ/(ρ * 3600).

Wait, let me calculate it numerically first.

So, μ = 3.0 lbm/(hr·ft)
ρ =62.4 lbm/ft³

So ν = 3.0 / (62.4 * 3600) ft²/s.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, ν is μ/ρ, but μ is in lbm/(hr·ft), and ρ is lbm/ft³.

So:

ν = μ / ρ = (3.0 lbm/(hr·ft)) / (62.4 lbm/ft³) = (3.0 / 62.4) * (1/(hr·ft)) * ft³ = (3.0/62.4) * ft²/(hr).

Which is approximately (0.048096) ft²/(hr). To convert to ft²/s, divide by 3600 seconds.

So ν = 0.048096 / 3600 ≈ 0.000013358 ft²/s.

Wait, but maybe I should do this more carefully.

Let me compute ν:

ν = μ / ρ = 3.0 lbm/(hr·ft) / 62.4 lbm/ft³.

So the lbm units cancel, and 3/62.4 = 0.048096. 

The units are (1/(hr·ft)) * ft³ = ft²/(hr).

So ν = 0.048096 ft²/hr.

Now convert that to ft²/s: 0.048096 / 3600 ≈ 0.000013358 ft²/s.

So ν ≈ 1.3358e-5 ft²/s.

Now, Re = (v * L) / ν.

v is 10 ft/s, L is 100 ft.

So Re = (10 * 100) / (1.3358e-5) = 1000 / 1.3358e-5 ≈ 74,845,000? Wait, that seems really high, but maybe it's correct.

Wait, 10 * 100 = 1000. 1000 divided by 1.3358e-5 is 1000 / 0.000013358 ≈ 74,845,000. So Re ≈ 7.4845e7.

Hmm, that's a pretty large Reynolds number, which makes sense for a boat moving through water, but I think the critical Re for transition to turbulence is around 5e5, so this would be well into the turbulent regime. But the problem is asking for the maximum boundary layer thickness, which I think refers to the case where the flow is entirely laminar, because the maximum thickness would occur if the entire plate is under laminar flow. Or perhaps the formula used assumes that.

Alternatively, the formula I remember for boundary layer thickness is δ = (5 * ν * L)/(v * sqrt(Re)). Or maybe δ = (4.64 * L)/(sqrt(Re)).

Wait, I think the exact formula is δ = (5 * ν * L )/(v * sqrt(Re)), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the formula is δ= (5 * L)/(Re^{1/2}).

Wait, maybe I should get the exact formula. So for a flat plate in laminar flow, the boundary layer thickness is given by δ = (5 * L) / (Re^{1/2} ), or perhaps δ = (4.64 L) / (Re^{1/2} ), because I remember that the exact solution for the Blasius problem gives a δ of about 4.64 times (L/√Re).

Wait, let me confirm. The Blasius solution gives the boundary layer thickness δ as δ = (4.64 L) / sqrt(Re). So that's the formula I should use.

So, Re is about 7.4845e7, so sqrt(Re) is sqrt(7.4845e7) ≈ 8648.5.

So δ = (4.64 * 100 ft) / 8648.5 ≈ (464) / 8648.5 ≈ 0.0537 ft. Wait, that's about 0.0537 ft, which is 0.645 inches. But none of the options are that small. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the calculation because the options are all around 0.45 to 2.5 ft.

Wait, maybe I messed up the kinematic viscosity calculation. Let me redo that part.

Given:

μ = 3.0 lbm/(hr·ft)

ρ =62.4 lbm/ft³

So ν = μ / ρ = (3.0 / 62.4) (ft²)/(hr), since (lbm/(hr·ft)) / (lbm/ft³) )= (ft³/(hr·ft)) )= ft²/hr.

So 3/62.4 = 0.048096, so ν = 0.048096 ft²/hr.

Convert that to ft²/s: 0.048096 / 3600 = 0.000013358 ft²/s.

Wait, that's correct. So ν ≈ 1.3358e-5 ft²/s.

Then Re = (v L) / ν = (10 ft/s * 100 ft) / (1.3358e-5 ft²/s) = 1000 / 1.3358e-5 ≈ 74,844,086.

So Re ≈ 7.4844086e7.

Then sqrt(Re) = sqrt(7.4844e7) ≈ 8648.4.

Then δ = (4.64 *100) / 8648.4 ≈ 464 / 8648.4 ≈ 0.0537 ft ≈ 0.645 inches. That's way smaller than any of the options given. So that can't be right. I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong formula. Maybe the formula is different for the maximum thickness, or perhaps it's for turbulent flow. Because if Re is that high, the flow is turbulent, but the maximum thickness would perhaps be based on laminar flow up to some point and turbulent beyond. Or maybe the question is just asking for the calculation using a certain formula regardless of the actual flow regime.

Alternatively, perhaps I used the wrong units when calculating ν.

Wait, let me try an alternative approach. Maybe using the formula δ = (4.64 L) / sqrt(Re), but perhaps I should compute Re differently. Let's try to compute Re using the units correctly.

Wait, another approach: use the formula Re = (ρ v L) / μ.

But wait, the units for μ are lbm/(hr·ft). Let me make sure all units are consistent. Let's convert everything to SI units.

Wait, maybe it's easier to use the conversion factors to get everything into consistent units.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute Re using the given units without converting.

Wait, the formula is Re = (ρ * v * L) / μ.

ρ is given in lbm/ft³, v in ft/s, L in ft, and μ in lbm/(hr·ft). So the units are:

(lbm/ft³) * (ft/s) * (ft) / (lbm/(hr·ft)) )

Simplify numerator: lbm/ft³ * ft/s * ft = lbm/(s·ft³) * ft² = lbm/(s·ft).

Denominator: lbm/(hr·ft).

So overall, Re has units (lbm/(s·ft)) / (lbm/(hr·ft)) ) = (1/(s·ft)) * (hr·ft) = hr/s.

Wait, but that can't be right because Re should be dimensionless. So I must have made a mistake in the unit analysis. Maybe I should convert μ to lbm/(ft·s) instead of per hour.

Because 1 hour is 3600 seconds, so 1 lbm/(hr·ft) is (1/3600) lbm/(s·ft).

So μ = 3.0 lbm/(hr·ft) = 3.0/(3600) lbm/(s·ft) ≈ 0.000833333 lbm/(s·ft).

Now, Re = (ρ * v * L) / μ.

Plugging in the numbers:

ρ = 62.4 lbm/ft³
v =10 ft/s
L=100 ft
μ=0.000833333 lbm/(s·ft)

So Re = (62.4 * 10 * 100) / 0.000833333.

Calculate numerator: 62.4 *10 =624, 624 *100=62400.

Denominator: 0.000833333.

So Re = 62400 / 0.000833333 ≈ 62400 * 1200 ≈ 74880000.

Same as before, Re ≈ 7.488e7.

So that's correct. So then the calculation for δ is the same as before, leading to about 0.0537 ft. But the options are all much larger, so I'm clearly missing something.

Wait, maybe the formula for δ is different. I thought it was δ = (4.64 L) / sqrt(Re). But perhaps I should use a different formula, maybe δ ≈ (5 L) / (Re^{1/2}) or another coefficient.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula for the maximum boundary layer thickness, which could be at the end of the transition or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using a different approach, such as the approximate method or considering the Prandtl formula differently.

Wait, another thought: Maybe I should use the formula δ = (5 * μ * L) / (ρ * v * sqrt(Re)).

Let me try that. Let's compute δ using that formula.

But wait, let me think about the dimensions. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula δ = (5 * ν * L ) / (v * sqrt(Re)).

Wait, let me try that.

ν is 1.3358e-5 ft²/s.

So 5 * ν * L = 5 * 1.3358e-5 * 100 = 5 * 1.3358e-3 = 0.006679 ft²/s.

v is 10 ft/s. So (5 * ν * L) / (v * sqrt(Re)) ) = 0.006679 / (10 * 8648.4) )

Wait, 10 *8648.4 is 86484.

So 0.006679 / 86484 ≈ 7.73e-8 ft. That's even smaller. That can't be right. So I must have the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the formula. Maybe δ = (5 * L) / (Re^(1/2)).

So Re is 7.488e7, so sqrt(Re) is 8648.4.

So δ = (5 * 100) / 8648.4 ≈ 500 / 8648.4 ≈ 0.0578 ft. Still around 0.05 ft, which is not matching any options.

Hmm, this suggests I'm doing something wrong, because the options are much larger.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong formula. Maybe the formula for maximum boundary layer thickness is different. Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps I should use the formula for the thickness when the flow is turbulent. For turbulent flow over a flat plate, the boundary layer thickness can be approximated by δ ≈ (0.376 * L) / (Re^{1/5}).

Wait, let me try that.

Re is 7.488e7, so Re^{1/5} is the fifth root of Re. Let me compute that.

The fifth root of 7.488e7. Let me compute:

7.488e7 = 74,880,000.

What's the fifth root of 74,880,000?

Well, 10^5 is 100,000.

So (10^5)^5 = 1e25, which is way bigger. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of exponents.

Take log10(74880000) ≈ log10(7.488e7) ≈ 7.874.

So the fifth root is 10^(7.874/5) ≈ 10^(1.5748) ≈ 37.4.

So Re^{1/5} ≈ 37.4.

So δ ≈ (0.376 * 100) / 37.4 ≈ 37.6 / 37.4 ≈ 1.005 ft.

That's about 1.005 ft, which would correspond to option C: 1.05 ft, or option I:1.2ft, or option J:1.5ft. Hmm, close to 1 ft.

But wait, option C is 1.05, which is close. But perhaps my approximation is off.

Wait, maybe the fifth root was miscalculated. Let me compute it more accurately.

Re = 74,880,000 = 7.488e7.

Compute ln(7.488e7) = ln(7.488) + ln(1e7) ≈ 2.014 + 16.118 = 18.132.

Then (1/5)*ln(Re) ≈ 3.626, so exp(3.626) ≈ 37.7.

So Re^{1/5} ≈ 37.7.

So δ ≈ (0.376 * 100) / 37.7 ≈ 37.6 / 37.7 ≈ 0.997 ft, approximately 1.0 ft.

Looking back at the options, option C is 1.05 ft, which is close. But let me check if the coefficient is correct.

Wait, for turbulent flow, δ ≈ (0.376 * x) / (Re_x)^{1/5}.

Yes, that's the formula I remember. So in our case, x is 100 ft.

So that gives us about 0.997 ft, which is approximately 1.0 ft. But the closest option is C:1.05ft.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact fifth root would give a slightly different value. Let me compute Re^{1/5} more accurately.

Compute Re=74,880,000.

Find n where n^5 =74,880,000.

Let me try 38^5: 38^2=1444, 38^3=1444*38=54,  38^3=54,  38^4=54*38=2052, 38^5=2052*38=78,  so 38^5=78,096,000. That's higher than 74,880,000.

What about 37^5: 37^2=1369, 37^3=1369*37=50,  37^3=50,653, 37^4=50,653*37=1,874,  37^4=1,874,161, 37^5=1,874,161*37=69,343
