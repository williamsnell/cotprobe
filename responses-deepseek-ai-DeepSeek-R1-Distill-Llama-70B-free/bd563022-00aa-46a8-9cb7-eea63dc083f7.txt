Okay, so I've got this problem about vapor pressures of benzene and toluene. Let me try to figure this out. Hmm, the question gives me the vapor pressures of pure benzene and toluene at 60°C as 385 and 139 Torr respectively. I need to calculate the partial pressures, total vapor pressure, and the mole fraction of toluene in the vapor. The solution has a mole fraction of toluene of 0.60.

Wait, right, this is a problem about Raoult's Law, I think. Raoult's Law states that the partial pressure of a component in a solution is equal to the mole fraction of that component in the solution multiplied by its pure vapor pressure. So, for each component, P = X_solvent * P_pure.

So part (a) is about finding the partial pressures of benzene and toluene in the solution. Let me jot that down. 

The mole fraction of toluene in the solution is given as 0.60. Since the solution is benzene and toluene, the mole fraction of benzene must be 1 - 0.60 = 0.40.

So for benzene: P_benzene = X_benzene * P_pure_benzene. That would be 0.40 * 385 Torr. Let me calculate that. 0.4*385 is 154 Torr. Wait, 0.4 * 300 is 120, 0.4*85 is 34, so 120+34=154. So P_benzene is 154 Torr.

And for toluene: P_toluene = X_toluene * P_pure_toluene. That's 0.60 * 139 Torr. Let me compute that. 0.6 * 100 is 60, 0.6 *39 is 23.4, so total 83.4 Torr.

Wait wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 154 and 83.4 as an option. Let me check the options again. Oh wait, option I has P_benzene=154 and P_toluene=83.4. Let me check the other parts.

Part (b) is the total vapor pressure. That's the sum of the partial pressures. So 154 + 83.4 = 237.4 Torr. Option I's total is 237.4, which matches. So that's a good sign.

Part (c) is the mole fraction of toluene in the vapor. The mole fraction in the vapor is calculated as the partial pressure of toluene divided by the total pressure. So X_toluene_vapor = P_toluene / P_total.

P_toluene is 83.4, P_total is 237.4. So 83.4 / 237.4. Let me compute that. Let's see, 83.4 divided by 237.4. Hmm. Let me approximate. 237.4 is about 237.4. Let's see, 83.4 divided by 237.4.

Wait, 237.4 * 0.35 is about 83. So 0.35? Wait, 0.35 *237.4= 83. So yes, approximately 0.351, maybe.

Looking at option I, X_toluene_vap is 0.351. So that's exactly what I get. So option I matches all three parts.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Let me double-check the partial pressures.

Benzene: 0.4 * 385 = 154. Correct.

Toluene: 0.6 *139 = 83.4. Correct.

Total: 154 +83.4=237.4. Correct.

Mole fraction in vapor: 83.4 / 237.4. Let me compute that more accurately.

83.4 ÷ 237.4. Let's do it step by step.

237.4 * 0.35 = 237.4 *0.3=71.22, 237.4 *0.05=11.87. So 71.22+11.87=83.09. So 0.35 gives 83.09, which is just a little less than 83.4. So the actual value is just a bit higher than 0.35. Let me compute 83.4 /237.4.

Compute 83.4 divided by 237.4.

237.4 * x =83.4.

Let me compute 83.4 /237.4. Let me write it as (approx):

237.4 × 0.35 = 83.09, as before.

The difference is 83.4 -83.09 = 0.31.

So 0.31 /237.4 = approximately 0.0013. So x is approximately 0.35 + 0.0013= 0.3513. So about 0.351. So option I gives 0.351, which matches.

Looking back at the options, option I is:

P_benzene=154.0, P_toluene=83.4, P_total=237.4, X_toluene_vap=0.351.

So that's the correct choice.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't miss any steps. Oh wait, wait. No, the mole fraction in the vapor is toluene's partial pressure over total pressure. So yes, correct.

So the correct answer should be option I.

To solve the problem, we use Raoult's Law, which states that the partial pressure of a component in a solution is given by:

\[
P_i = X_i \cdot P_i^\text{pure}
\]

where \(P_i\) is the partial pressure, \(X_i\) is the mole fraction of the component in the solution, and \(P_i^\text{pure}\) is the vapor pressure of the pure component.

### Part (a): Partial Pressures
1. **Benzene**:  
   The mole fraction of benzene in the solution is \(X_{\text{benzene}} = 1 - X_{\text{toluene}} = 1 - 0.60 = 0.40\).  
   Using Raoult's Law:  
   \[
   P_{\text{benzene}} = X_{\text{benzene}} \cdot P_{\text{benzene}}^\text{pure} = 0.40 \cdot 385 = 154.0 \, \text{Torr}.
   \]

2. **Toluene**:  
   The mole fraction of toluene in the solution is \(X_{\text{toluene}} = 0.60\).  
   Using Raoult's Law:  
   \[
   P_{\text{toluene}} = X_{\text{toluene}} \cdot P_{\text{toluene}}^\text{pure} = 0.60 \cdot 139 = 83.4 \, \text{Torr}.
   \]

### Part (b): Total Vapor Pressure
The total vapor pressure is the sum of the partial pressures:  
\[
P_{\text{total}} = P_{\text{benzene}} + P_{\text{toluene}} = 154.0 + 83.4 = 237.4 \, \text{Torr}.
\]

### Part (c): Mole Fraction of Toluene in the Vapor
The mole fraction of toluene in the vapor is given by:  
\[
X_{\text{toluene, vapor}} = \frac{P_{\text{toluene}}}{P_{\text{total}}} = \frac{83.4}{237.4}.
\]

Performing the division:  
\[
X_{\text{toluene, vapor}} \approx 0.351.
\]

### Matching with Options
From the calculations:  
- \(P_{\text{benzene}} = 154.0 \, \text{Torr}\),  
- \(P_{\text{toluene}} = 83.4 \, \text{Torr}\),  
- \(P_{\text{total}} = 237.4 \, \text{Torr}\),  
- \(X_{\text{toluene, vapor}} = 0.351\).  

These values match **Option I**.
