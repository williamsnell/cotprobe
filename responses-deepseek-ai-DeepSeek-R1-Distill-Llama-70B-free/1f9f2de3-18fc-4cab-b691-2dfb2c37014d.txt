Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see... The question is about a bullet being stopped by a steel plate and calculating the heat generated. I remember that when objects stop, their kinetic energy is converted into other forms, like heat in this case.

The problem gives me the mass of the bullet and its velocity. The bullet's mass is 50 grams, and it's moving at 40,000 cm per second. Hmm, wait, I should probably convert these units into something more standard for physics calculations. Typically, mass is in kilograms and velocity in meters per second.

So, 50 grams is 0.05 kilograms because 1 kg is 1000 grams. And 40,000 cm per second... since 1 meter is 100 cm, that would be 40,000 divided by 100, which is 400 meters per second. Oh wait, 40,000 cm/s is 400 m/s. That's pretty fast, like a bullet speed.

Now, kinetic energy is given by the formula KE = ½ mv². Right, so I'll plug in the values here. Let's compute that.

First, m is 0.05 kg, v is 400 m/s. So v squared is 400 squared. 400 times 400 is 160,000. Then, m times v squared is 0.05 * 160,000. Let me calculate that: 0.05 times 160,000. 0.05 is like 5%, so 5% of 160,000 is 8,000. So 8,000. Then, KE is half of that, so 8,000 divided by 2 is 4,000. So the kinetic energy is 4,000 joules?

Wait, but the answer options are in ergs. Oh right, I need to convert joules to ergs. Because 1 joule is 10^7 ergs. So 4,000 joules multiplied by 10^7 ergs per joule. Let's see: 4,000 * 1e7 = 4e10 ergs. So 4 times 10 to the 10th power ergs.

Looking at the options, option F is 4e10 ergs. So that should be the correct answer. But wait, let me double-check my calculations to avoid any mistakes.

Wait another thing: Did I correctly convert the units? Let me recheck. Mass: 50 g = 0.05 kg, correct. Velocity: 40,000 cm/s is 400 m/s because 40,000 / 100 = 400. Yes. Then v squared is 400^2 is 160,000. Then 0.05 * 160,000 is 8,000. Half of that is 4,000 J. Then multiply by 1e7 to get ergs: 4e10. Yes.

So that's F. Option F.

To determine the heat generated when a 50 g bullet traveling at 40,000 cm/sec is stopped by a steel plate, we calculate the kinetic energy of the bullet using the formula:

\[
KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2
\]

### Step 1: Convert units
- Mass: \( 50 \, \text{g} = 0.05 \, \text{kg} \)
- Velocity: \( 40,000 \, \text{cm/sec} = 400 \, \text{m/sec} \)

### Step 2: Calculate kinetic energy
\[
KE = \frac{1}{2} (0.05) (400)^2
\]
\[
KE = \frac{1}{2} (0.05) (160,000) = \frac{1}{2} (8,000) = 4,000 \, \text{J}
\]

### Step 3: Convert joules to ergs
Since \( 1 \, \text{J} = 10^7 \, \text{ergs} \):
\[
4,000 \, \text{J} \times 10^7 \, \text{ergs/J} = 4 \times 10^{10} \, \text{ergs}
\]

### Final Answer
The heat generated is \( 4 \times 10^{10} \, \text{ergs} \), which corresponds to **option F**.
