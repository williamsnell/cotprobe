Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about vertical integration forwards. Hmm, I remember that vertical integration involves a company expanding its operations along the supply chain. But wait, what's the difference between forward and backward integration?

So, backward integration would be when a company moves towards the source of raw materials or inputs. Like, if a company owns its suppliers, that's backward. So forward integration must be the opposite direction.

Forward integration is when a company moves towards the end consumer. So they might acquire distribution channels, retail stores, or other businesses that are closer to the consumer. For example, a manufacturer buying a retail chain.

The question is asking about vertical integration forwards, which is when a firm merges or acquires another. The options are A to I. Let me look through them.

Option A: Towards the consumer. That makes sense because forward integration is moving towards the consumer end.

Option B: With a competitor. That sounds more like horizontal integration, where companies in the same industry merge.

Option C: At the same stage of the supply chain. Again, that's horizontal, same stage.

Option D: In a different country. That's more about globalization, not vertical.

Option E: Towards the manufacturer. Wait, if a company is moving towards the manufacturer, isn't that backward? Because manufacturer is the next step from supplier.

Option F: Towards the source of supply. That's backward integration, so not forward.

Option G: In another industry. That's probably diversification, not vertical.

Option H: At a different stage of the supply chain. Vertical integration involves moving to a different stage, but the direction matters here. So if it's forward, it's towards the consumer.

Option I: Towards the supplier of raw materials. That's definitely backward.

So the correct answer should be A: Towards the consumer.
