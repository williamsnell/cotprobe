Okay, let's try to figure out this question. So, the question is about why rising prices are a problem. The options are from A to J. Hmm, I remember that this has to do with economics, specifically inflation. 

So, when prices rise, that means inflation is happening. I think inflation is when things cost more money, so the same amount of money buys you less than before. That must affect people's savings because the money they've saved won't go as far. 

Looking at the options, let's go through each one. Option A says people will stop spending money altogether. I don't think that's right because people still need to buy things like food and clothes, even if they cost more. They might spend less, but not stop entirely.

Option B is about businesses paying more taxes. I'm not sure how that's directly a problem of rising prices. Taxes might depend on profits, but I don't think that's the main issue here.

Option C says it leads to a decrease in national GDP. Wait, GDP is the total of all goods and services. If prices are higher, does that mean GDP goes up or down? Because GDP can be nominal or real. Nominal GDP would increase with prices, but real GDP (adjusted for inflation) might not. So I'm not sure if this is the right answer.

Option D suggests the government will print more money. Well, sometimes governments do that, but that's more of a cause of inflation, not a problem caused by it. So probably not D.

Option E is about the stock market decreasing. I'm not certain about this. Sometimes inflation can affect stocks, but it's not the direct problem of rising prices for individuals. Plus, stocks might go up or down based on various factors.

Option F states that money in savings can buy fewer goods and services. That makes sense because if prices rise, the same amount of money doesn't go as far. So this seems like a strong candidate.

Option G says household incomes don't rise with prices. That's another good point. If wages don't keep up with inflation, people effectively earn less. But the question is asking for a problem, and F is more about savings, while G is about income not matching. Both are issues, but which is more directly the problem of rising prices?

Option H claims the economy could run out of money. That doesn't make much sense. The economy isn't likely to run out of money just because prices rise; it's more about the value of money decreasing.

Option I is about borrowers repaying loans with more dollars. Wait, if prices rise, the value of money decreases, so the real value of the loan decreases. Borrowers might actually benefit because they're paying back in less valuable money. So I don't think I is correct.

Option J says it leads to higher unemployment. I'm not sure about that. Sometimes inflation can lead to higher wages which might cause unemployment if businesses can't afford it, but that's more indirect. The question is about the direct problem.

So, narrowing it down, the main issues are F and G. The question is why rising prices are a problem. F talks about savings buying less, which directly affects people's purchasing power. G is about incomes not keeping up, which also reduces purchasing power. But which one is more directly the problem?

I think both are correct in a way, but the question is phrased as "rising prices are a problem because..." So all else equal, the problem is that the money people have saved (like in savings accounts) can't buy as much. So F would be the correct answer.

Wait, but another thought: when prices rise, the real income decreases if wages don't rise. So maybe both F and G are correct, but the options are single choice. So which one is more directly the reason?

I think F is more about the effect on savings, while G is about earnings. The question might be pointing towards the general problem that people's money doesn't go as far, which is F. Alternatively, G is about income not rising, which is a different issue.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is G. Because if incomes don't rise with prices, then people have less purchasing power. So when prices rise, but their income stays the same, they can't buy as much. That's a problem. But F is about savings, which is also a problem but maybe more specific.

I'm a bit confused now. Let me think again. The question is why rising prices are a problem. So the primary issue is that the same amount of money buys fewer goods and services. So F directly addresses that. G is about income not rising, which is another problem but not the direct effect of prices rising on existing money.

So I think F is the correct answer.

The question asks why rising prices are a problem, focusing on the effects of inflation. Rising prices reduce the purchasing power of money, meaning the same amount of money buys fewer goods and services. This directly impacts household savings, as the money saved loses value over time. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, D, H, I, J**: These options are incorrect because they either misrepresent the effects of inflation or are unrelated to the direct problem of rising prices.
- **C**: While inflation can affect GDP, it is not the primary issue here.
- **E**: Stock market values may be influenced by inflation, but this is not the main problem of rising prices.
- **F**: This option correctly identifies that money in savings accounts can buy fewer goods and services, directly addressing the reduced purchasing power due to inflation.
- **G**: While household incomes not rising with prices is a related issue, it is not as directly tied to the problem of rising prices as F.

The most accurate answer is **F**, as it directly addresses the reduced purchasing power of money due to rising prices.

Answer: F
