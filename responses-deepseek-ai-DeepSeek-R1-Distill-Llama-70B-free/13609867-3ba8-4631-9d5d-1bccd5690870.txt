Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I'm supposed to find the ones digit of the product of numbers from 1 to 9. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the ones digit of a product depends only on the ones digits of the numbers being multiplied. So I don't need to calculate the entire product, which is good because 9 factorial is a pretty big number.

Wait, 9 factorial is 1×2×3×4×5×6×7×8×9. But since I only care about the ones digit, I can track how the ones digit changes as I multiply each number step by step.

Let me start multiplying step by step, keeping track of just the ones digit each time.

Start with 1. The ones digit is 1.

Multiply by 2: 1×2=2. Ones digit is 2.

Multiply by 3: 2×3=6. Ones digit is 6.

Multiply by 4: 6×4=24. Ones digit is 4.

Multiply by 5: 4×5=20. Ones digit is 0.

Wait a minute, when I multiply by 5, the ones digit becomes 0. And once there's a 0 in the ones place, any further multiplication won't change that. Because anything multiplied by 0 is 0.

So after multiplying by 5, the product is ...0, and multiplying by 6, 7, 8, or 9 won't affect the ones digit anymore. So the ones digit will stay 0.

Therefore, the answer should be option C: 0.

I think that's right. No need to calculate the entire product. Just track step by step until the ones digit becomes zero, which happens early on when multiplying by 5.

To determine the ones digit of \(1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 \cdot 7 \cdot 8 \cdot 9\), we only need to track the ones digit at each step of the multiplication:

1. Start with 1.  
   Ones digit: **1**

2. Multiply by 2: \(1 \cdot 2 = 2\).  
   Ones digit: **2**

3. Multiply by 3: \(2 \cdot 3 = 6\).  
   Ones digit: **6**

4. Multiply by 4: \(6 \cdot 4 = 24\).  
   Ones digit: **4**

5. Multiply by 5: \(4 \cdot 5 = 20\).  
   Ones digit: **0**

Once the ones digit becomes 0, further multiplications will not change it. Therefore, the ones digit of the entire product is **0**.

**Answer: C**
