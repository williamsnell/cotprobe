Okay, so I've got this problem here about profit maximization. Hmm, let's see. The question has two parts, (a) and (b). I need to find the profit function and then determine the value of x where the profit is maximized.

Alright, starting with part (a). I remember that profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost. The price of the product is given as $50. So, the revenue R(x) would be the price per unit multiplied by the number of units sold, which is x. So R(x) = 50x.

The cost function is provided as C(x) = 1000 + 0.01x². So, the profit function P(x) should be R(x) minus C(x). Let me write that down: P(x) = 50x - (1000 + 0.01x²). Simplifying that, it's P(x) = -0.01x² + 50x - 1000. Okay, that seems straightforward.

Now, moving on to part (b), finding the value of x that maximizes profit. Since the profit function is a quadratic equation, and the coefficient of x² is negative (-0.01), the parabola opens downward. That means the vertex is the maximum point.

The vertex of a parabola given by P(x) = ax² + bx + c is at x = -b/(2a). In this case, a is -0.01 and b is 50. So plugging in the values, x = -50/(2*(-0.01)) = -50 / (-0.02) = 2500. So x is 2500 units.

Wait, let me double-check that. The formula is correct, right? Vertex at -b/(2a). So yes, that's right. So x equals 2500.

Looking at the options, let's find which one matches. The profit function I found is P(x) = -0.01x² +50x -1000. Looking through the options:

Option C matches this profit function and x=2500. Option C says P(x) = -0.01x² +50x -1000, x=2500. So that must be the answer.

Wait, let me check the other options just to make sure I'm not missing something. Option A has x=1500 with a different P(x). Option B has x=5000, which seems too high. Option D's P(x) is different. Option E's P(x) has positive 0.01x², which can't be right because the profit function should have a negative x² term. Similarly, others have different coefficients. So yes, option C is correct.

To determine the profit function and the value of \( x \) that maximizes profit, we start by calculating the profit as total revenue minus total cost. The revenue \( R(x) \) is the price per unit ($50) multiplied by the number of units sold (\( x \)), so \( R(x) = 50x \). The cost function is given as \( C(x) = 1000 + 0.01x^2 \). Therefore, the profit function is:

\[
P(x) = R(x) - C(x) = 50x - (1000 + 0.01x^2) = -0.01x^2 + 50x - 1000.
\]

Next, to find the value of \( x \) that maximizes profit, we note that the profit function is a quadratic equation of the form \( P(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \), where \( a = -0.01 \), \( b = 50 \), and \( c = -1000 \). Since \( a < 0 \), the parabola opens downward, and the maximum profit occurs at the vertex. The vertex of a parabola is located at:

\[
x = -\frac{b}{2a}.
\]

Substituting the values of \( a \) and \( b \):

\[
x = -\frac{50}{2(-0.01)} = -\frac{50}{-0.02} = 2500.
\]

Thus, the profit is maximized when \( x = 2500 \).

Examining the options, the profit function \( P(x) = -0.01x^2 + 50x - 1000 \) and the maximizing value \( x = 2500 \) match **Option C**.
