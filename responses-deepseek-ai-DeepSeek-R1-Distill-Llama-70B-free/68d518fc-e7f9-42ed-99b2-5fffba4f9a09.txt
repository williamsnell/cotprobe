Okay, so I have this genetics problem here about Salmonella typhimurium and mutation rates. Hmm, let me try to break this down. So, the strain they're talking about is His^- because of a base pair substitution. His^- means they can't synthesize histidine, right? So they require histidine to grow. 

The problem says the spontaneous reversion rate is 5e-8, which is pretty low. Spontaneous reversion is when the bacteria mutate back to His^+, meaning they can grow without histidine. So without any treatment, the rate is low.

Now, they added Chemical X to the growth medium. Then they diluted the solutions and plated them onto two types of media: minimal medium and nutrient-rich medium. They used a 10^-2 dilution for minimal and 10^-3 for rich. After incubation, they counted the colonies.

Minimal medium probably lacks histidine because it's minimal. So for a His^- strain, they can't grow on minimal medium unless they revert to His^+. So the colonies on minimal medium must be revertants. On the other hand, nutrient-rich medium likely has all the nutrients, including histidine, so both His^- and His^+ can grow there.

So the data: 50 colonies on minimal (so 50 revertants) and 1000 on rich. Wait, but what about the dilution factors? The minimal was 10^-2, so the number of revertants would be 50 * 100 (since 10^-2 dilution, multiply by 100 to get per mL original). Wait, no, actually, when you plate 10^-2 dilution, each plate's count is number per 0.1 mL (assuming standard plating). So the total colonies would be 50 * 100 (if they plated 0.1 mL of 10^-2). Wait, maybe I'm confusing the dilutions. Let me think again: if you have a 10^-2 dilution, you're taking 1/100th of the culture. So if you plate 0.1 mL, you're plating 0.001 mL of the original culture. Wait, perhaps the exact calculation isn't needed, as the question is about relative numbers.

But let's think about what the data shows. Without any treatment, the spontaneous mutation rate is 5e-8. So in a culture, the number of revertants would be low. When they add Chemical X, they're seeing more revertants on the minimal medium?

Wait, wait. Wait the setup: The bacteria are His^-. Without treatment, the spontaneous reversion rate is 5e-8. So when you plate on minimal medium, only His^+ revertants will grow. Let's say without treatment, they would get a certain number of colonies on minimal. But with Chemical X, they get 50 colonies on minimal. But wait, the question is, what's the comparison here? Because the problem doesn't give the numbers without Chemical X, so I have to infer based on the data given.

But the data is 50 on minimal (10^-2 dilution) and 1000 on rich (10^-3). So the total number of bacteria in the culture can be estimated from the rich medium. Rich medium supports growth of all bacteria, so the number is higher. Let's see: 1000 colonies from a 10^-3 dilution. So the original culture must have 1000 * 1000 (since 10^-3 is 1e-3, so multiply by 1e3 to get per mL) = 1e6 per mL. Wait, no, wait. If they diluted by 1e-3 and got 1000 colonies, then the concentration is 1000 / (1e-3 * volume plated). If they plated 0.1 mL, then 1000 colonies = 1e6 per mL (because 0.1 mL * 1e3 dilution factor * 1000 colonies = 1e6). So the culture has about 1e6 bacteria per mL.

So on minimal medium, they plated 1e-2 dilution, which is 1e4 bacteria (since 1e6 * 1e-2 = 1e4). So plating 1e4 bacteria and getting 50 colonies. That means the mutation rate is 50 / 1e4 = 5e-3. But wait, spontaneous is 5e-8. So that's a higher rate, meaning the chemical increased the mutation rate.

Wait, but wait. So without treatment, the number of revertants would be 5e-8 per cell. So in 1e6 cells, you would expect 5e-2, which is 0.05 colonies on minimal medium. But here, they have 50. So that's way higher. So the chemical increased the mutation rate.

But let me make sure I'm thinking correctly. When you have a mutation rate of 5e-8, that's per cell per generation. But the actual number of revertants depends on the number of cell divisions and the size of the culture. Alternatively, maybe the calculation is done based on the number of cells plated.

Wait, the minimal medium plates only allow His^+ to grow. So the number of colonies on minimal is the number of revertants. The rich medium allows all to grow, so it's the total viable count.

So the number of revertants is 50, and the total is 1000 (from rich medium at 1e-3). Wait, no, wait. Wait 1000 comes from 1e-3 dilution. So the total number of cells is 1000 * 1e3 (since 1e-3 dilution, to get the original concentration, multiply by 1e3). So 1e6 cells in the culture.

Wait, but the 50 colonies on minimal are from 1e-2 dilution. So 1e-2 dilution means that the number of cells plated is 1e6 * 1e-2 = 1e4. So 50 colonies from 1e4 cells is 5e-3. Which is a much higher mutation rate than 5e-8.

So this suggests that the mutation rate has increased. So the chemical is causing more mutations, i.e., it's mutagenic.

So looking at the options, option J says Chemical X is highly mutagenic. That seems to fit.

But wait, let me check the other options in case I'm missing something.

Option A: No effect on mutation rate. But the data shows higher than spontaneous, so A is wrong.

Option B: Repairs the substitution. If it repaired, His^- would revert, but that's a repair, not mutation. Wait, but no, because the number of revertants is higher, but repair would not increase mutation rate. Or perhaps it's causing reversion. But the question is about mutation rate. So B doesn't seem right.

Option C: Allows growth of His^- on minimal. But minimal medium doesn't provide histidine, so His^- can't grow. So C is incorrect.

Option D: Inhibits growth on minimal. But they have 50 colonies on minimal, so growth is possible, meaning His^+ revertants are there. D is wrong.

Option E: Beneficial for bacteria. But the data doesn't directly say that. It depends on other factors, but the question is about mutation.

Option F: Promotes growth on rich only. The rich medium had more colonies, but that's because more cells were there. So F is not the main point; the question is about mutation.

Option G: Selectively kills non-mutant. If that were the case, the non-mutants (His^-) would die, but the mutants (His^+) would survive. But on rich medium, both can grow. So if X kills non-mutants, then on rich medium, only His^+ would grow, but the data shows 1000 colonies on rich, which is more than minimal. So G is unlikely.

Option H: Increases mutation rate for other genes, not His. But the revertants are His^+, so the mutation is in the His gene. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Decreases mutation rate. No, the rate is higher than spontaneous. So I is wrong.

So the correct answer should be J: Chemical X is highly mutagenic.

The experiment involves a strain of Salmonella typhimurium that is His^- due to a base pair substitution, with a spontaneous reversion rate to His^+ of 5 × 10^-8. Chemical X was added to the growth medium, and the bacteria were plated onto minimal medium (10^-2 dilution) and nutrient-rich medium (10^-3 dilution). After incubation, 50 colonies were observed on minimal medium, and 1,000 colonies on nutrient-rich medium.

Key analysis:
1. **Minimal medium**: Only His^+ revertants can grow. The 50 colonies on minimal medium indicate that the mutation rate increased significantly compared to the spontaneous rate of 5 × 10^-8. This suggests that Chemical X increased the mutation rate.
2. **Nutrient-rich medium**: Both His^- and His^+ cells can grow. The 1,000 colonies indicate a total viable cell count of approximately 1 × 10^6 cells/mL, confirming that the culture grew normally.
3. **Comparison of mutation rates**: Without Chemical X, the expected number of revertants on minimal medium would be negligible (based on the spontaneous mutation rate). The observed 50 colonies on minimal medium, combined with the total cell count, indicate a much higher mutation rate when Chemical X is present.

Evaluation of options:
- **A**: Incorrect. The data shows a clear increase in mutation rate due to Chemical X.
- **B**: Incorrect. Chemical X does not repair the base pair substitution; it increases the mutation rate.
- **C**: Incorrect. His^- cells cannot grow on minimal medium, as it lacks histidine.
- **D**: Incorrect. The presence of 50 colonies on minimal medium indicates that growth is possible for revertants.
- **E**: Incorrect. The data does not directly indicate whether Chemical X is beneficial for the bacteria.
- **F**: Incorrect. The higher number of colonies on nutrient-rich medium is due to the total cell count, not selective growth promotion.
- **G**: Incorrect. Chemical X does not selectively kill non-mutant bacteria, as both His^- and His^+ cells grow on nutrient-rich medium.
- **H**: Incorrect. The increased mutation rate is specific to the His gene, as evidenced by the revertants on minimal medium.
- **I**: Incorrect. The mutation rate increased, not decreased.
- **J**: Correct. The data shows that Chemical X significantly increases the mutation rate, making it highly mutagenic.
