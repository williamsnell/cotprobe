Okay, so I've got this question about biomes. Hmm, let me think. The question says that the biome has plants with roots that can't go deep because of permafrost. I remember that permafrost is a layer of soil and rock that stays frozen all year. So which biome is that?

Wait, I think the tundra is the one with permafrost. Right, because the tundra is in really cold regions like Arctic areas. The soil is frozen, so plants can't have deep roots. They probably have shallow roots because the ground doesn't thaw much. 

Let me go through the options to make sure. Option C is Tundra, which fits. What about the others? Taiga is the coniferous forest, and I think trees there have deeper roots. Savanna has grasses and some trees, but no permafrost there. Alpine biome is mountainous, but I'm not sure if permafrost is the main issue. Oh wait, alpine regions can have permafrost too, but the question is about roots not going deep, and I think tundra is the primary one associated with permafrost limiting root growth.

So the answer should be C: Tundra.

The biome described is the Tundra, where permafrost prevents plant roots from growing deep.
