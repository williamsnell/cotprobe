Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about reducing hostility between groups of junior high students. Hmm, I need to figure out the best approach. Let me think about what I remember from psychology and group dynamics.

The question is asking what's the best way to decrease hostility between different student groups. The options are A through J. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A suggests individual counseling sessions. That might help individual students with their issues, but the problem here is between groups, so maybe it's not the most effective approach for group hostility.

Option B says assign goals that require intergroup cooperation. Oh, that sounds familiar. I think this relates to the concept of superordinate goals. When groups have to work together towards a common goal, it can reduce tensions because they have to collaborate. So this could be a good option.

Option C is about a community speaker. While having someone talk about cooperation might raise awareness, it might not lead to actual behavior change. People might listen but not necessarily change their actions, especially if the hostility is deep-rooted.

Option D involves teaching about the negative impacts using videos and presentations. Educational content can inform, but similar to option C, it might not directly reduce hostility between groups. It's more passive and might not engage the students to change their behavior.

Option E proposes group representatives discussing ways to reduce hostility. That could help, but it might not involve all members and could lead to more division if the representatives don't effectively communicate back to their groups.

Option F is a reward system for low hostility. Rewards can motivate, but they might only temporarily change behavior. Also, it could lead to superficial changes rather than genuine cooperation.

Option G suggests competitive games. Wait, competition might actually increase hostility, not decrease it. If groups are competing, especially in a school setting, it could exacerbate rivalries rather than reduce them.

Option H is increasing opportunities for contact under pleasant conditions. Oh, right! This reminds me of the contact hypothesis, which states that positive interactions between different groups can reduce prejudice and hostility. If students from different groups interact in a friendly environment, they might develop better relationships and reduce conflict.

Option I says each group should develop their own rules. That might actually create more division because each group is focusing on their own norms without interacting with others, which doesn't address the intergroup hostility.

Option J is about strict rules and penalties. While rules are important, just punishing hostile behavior might not address the underlying issues. It could suppress the behavior but not necessarily change the attitudes or reduce the hostility between groups.

So, considering all these, the two strongest options seem to be B and H. Assigning cooperative goals and increasing positive contact both sound effective. But which one is better? The contact hypothesis (option H) is a well-supported theory for reducing intergroup conflict. It suggests that simply bringing groups together in positive settings can diminish hostility because people get to know each other and break down stereotypes.

On the other hand, option B, with superordinate goals, also works by making groups cooperate. But it might require more structured activities and specific goal-setting, which could be more involved. Option H seems more straightforwardâ€”increasing positive interactions can naturally lead to reduced hostility.

Wait, but sometimes just increasing contact isn't enough. The contact needs to be under the right conditions, like equal status and cooperation. So if the contact is pleasant and cooperative, it would be effective. So option H is about increasing contact under pleasant conditions, which aligns with that.

So I think the best answer is H. It directly applies the contact hypothesis, which is a well-known method to reduce intergroup hostility.

To decrease hostility between groups of junior high school students, the best approach is to **increase opportunities for contact under pleasant conditions**. This method aligns with the contact hypothesis, which suggests that positive interactions between groups can reduce prejudice and hostility by allowing students to break down stereotypes and develop better relationships. While other options, such as assigning cooperative goals (option B), may also be effective, option H is more straightforward and directly addresses the need for positive intergroup interaction, which is a well-supported approach for reducing conflict.

Answer: H
