Okay, so I have this question here asking what's the loudest animal on Earth, and I need to choose the correct answer from options A to J. Let me think about this step by step.

First, I remember hearing that whales are really loud, but I'm not exactly sure which species. I think sperm whales might be one of the contenders. Oh wait, there's also the blue whale and the humpback whale. I've heard humpbacks make beautiful songs, but are they the loudest?

Then there's the other options like African elephant, lion, peacock, etc. I know that elephants can make rumbling sounds, especially low-frequency ones, but I'm not sure if they're the loudest in terms of decibels. Lions roar, but again, I don't think they reach the highest levels.

Wait, I think the sperm whale is known for making very loud clicks, especially when they echolocate. I remember reading somewhere that their clicks can reach up to 230 decibels. That's way louder than most other animals. For comparison, a jet engine is around 140 dB, so 230 is insanely loud. So that would make the sperm whale the loudest.

Looking at the options, F is sperm whale. So the answer should be F.

Another thought: the blue whale's calls are also loud, but I think sperm whales are louder. Humpback whales are known for their songs which are more melodic but not as loud as the sperm whale's clicks. So yeah, F makes sense.

The sperm whale is recognized as the loudest animal on Earth, with its clicks reaching up to 230 decibels. This surpasses other contenders like the blue whale and African elephant. 

Answer: F
