Okay, so I've got this probability problem here. Hmm, let's try to break it down. The question is about drawing two cards consecutively without replacement from a standard deck. I need to find the probability that the first card is a face card and the second is an ace.

Wait, what's a face card again? Oh right, those are Jack, Queen, King. So each suit has three face cards, making a total of 12 in the deck because there are four suits. Got it.

So the deck has 52 cards in total. The first draw is a face card, which has 12 possibilities. After drawing one face card without replacement, the deck now has 51 cards left.

Now, the second draw needs to be an ace. How many aces are there? Four, one for each suit. But wait, I need to make sure the first card drawn wasn't an ace because we don't replace it. Oh wait, no, face cards are Jack, Queen, King—so none of them are aces. So the number of aces remains four in the second draw.

So the probability for the first event (face card) is 12 out of 52. For the second event, given the first was a face card, it's 4 out of 51. So the combined probability is (12/52) multiplied by (4/51).

Let me compute that. 12 divided by 52 simplifies. Both are divisible by 4: 12/52 = 3/13. And 4/51 is already simplified. So 3/13 * 4/51 = (3*4)/(13*51) = 12/(663). Let me see if that can be reduced. 12 and 663: 3 is a common factor. 12 ÷3 is 4, 663 ÷3 is 221. So 4/221.

Looking at the options, option J is 4/221. So that should be the answer.

To determine the probability that a face card is drawn first and an ace second in two consecutive draws without replacement from a standard deck:

1. **Face Cards**: There are 12 face cards (Jack, Queen, King) in a 52-card deck. The probability of drawing a face card first is \( \frac{12}{52} \), which simplifies to \( \frac{3}{13} \).

2. **Aces**: After drawing a face card, the deck has 51 cards left. There are 4 aces in the deck, and since face cards are not aces, all 4 aces remain. The probability of drawing an ace second is \( \frac{4}{51} \).

3. **Combined Probability**: Multiply the probabilities of the two independent events:
   \[
   P(\text{face card then ace}) = \frac{12}{52} \times \frac{4}{51} = \frac{3}{13} \times \frac{4}{51} = \frac{12}{663}.
   \]
   Simplify \( \frac{12}{663} \) by dividing numerator and denominator by 3:
   \[
   \frac{12}{663} = \frac{4}{221}.
   \]

Thus, the probability is \( \frac{4}{221} \), which corresponds to option **J**.
