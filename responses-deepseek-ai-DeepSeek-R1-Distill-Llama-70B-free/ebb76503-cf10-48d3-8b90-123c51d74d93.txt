Okay, so I've got this aerodynamics problem here, and I need to solve part (a) first. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The airplane's wings have a total plan area of 320 square feet. The plane weighs 18,000 pounds-force (lbf). The speed in level flight is 230 feet per second, and the air density is 0.076 slugs per cubic foot. Wait, actually, wait, no—wait, the units here are a bit confusing. Oh, right, in the problem statement, the atmospheric density is given as 0.076 lbm/ft³. But wait, in aerodynamics, the usual unit is slugs per cubic foot for density because the equations involve pounds-force and seconds. Let me think about this. Oh, right, 1 slug is 32.174 lbm·s⁻² ft⁻¹, so to convert lbm/ft³ to slugs/ft³, I divide by 32.174. Because 1 slug = 32.174 lbm, so 1 lbm/ft³ equals 1/(32.174) slugs per cubic foot.

Wait, the problem gives density as 0.076 lbm/ft³. So converting that to slugs/ft³, it's 0.076 / 32.174 ≈ 0.00236 slugs/ft³. Hmm, that seems low. But maybe I should double-check that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different unit for density. Wait, perhaps the problem is using lbm/ft³ as the unit, but in reality, in aerodynamic equations, we use slugs/ft³. So I need to convert 0.076 lbm/ft³ to slugs/ft³ by dividing by 32.174. Let me calculate that: 0.076 divided by 32.174 is approximately 0.00236 slugs per cubic foot.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because 0.076 lbm/ft³ seems a bit high for air density. Wait, no, because at sea level, air density is about 0.0765 lbm/ft³, which is approximately 0.00237 slugs/ft³ (since 0.0765 /32.174 ≈ 0.00237). So that makes sense. So I'll proceed with that.

The first part (a) asks: If the tailplane contributes 5% of the total lift force, what must be the lift coefficient of the wings at this operating condition?

So, the total lift force must balance the weight of the airplane in level flight. So the weight is 18,000 lbf. The tailplane contributes 5% of the total lift, so the wings must contribute 95% of the total lift.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. If the tailplane contributes 5% of the total lift, then the wings contribute 95% of the total lift, right? Because 100% minus 5% is 95%.

So the total lift is the weight, which is 18,000 lbf. So the lift from the wings is 95% of 18,000, which is 0.95 * 18,000 = 17,100 lbf.

Now, the lift equation is: Lift = (1/2) * density * velocity² * wing area * lift coefficient.

So, we can solve for the lift coefficient (Cl) of the wings.

Given:
- Lift (L) = 17,100 lbf
- Density (ρ) = 0.076 lbm/ft³ → which is 0.076 / 32.174 ≈ 0.00236 slugs/ft³
- Velocity (V) = 230 ft/s
- Wing area (S) = 320 ft²

So, plugging into the equation:

Cl = (2 * L) / (ρ * V² * S)

Wait, but let me make sure about the units. Since L is in lbf, and the other terms are in imperial units, this should work out.

Calculating each part:

First, compute the denominator: ρ * V² * S.

ρ is approximately 0.00236 slugs/ft³.

V squared is 230^2 = 52,900 ft²/s².

So ρ * V² = 0.00236 * 52,900 ≈ let's compute that.

0.00236 * 52,900.

Hmm, let's calculate 52,900 * 0.002 = 105.8, and 52,900 * 0.00036 is approximately 52,900 * 0.0003 = 15.87 and 52,900 * 0.00006=3.174. So 15.87 + 3.174 = 19.044. So total is 105.8 + 19.044 = 124.844.

Then multiply by the wing area S=320 ft²: 124.844 * 320.

Let me compute 124.844 * 300 = 37,453.2, and 124.844 * 20 = 2,496.88. So total is 37,453.2 + 2,496.88 = 39,950.08.

So denominator is approximately 39,950.08.

Then, 2 * L = 2 * 17,100 = 34,200.

So Cl = 34,200 / 39,950.08 ≈ let's compute that.

34,200 ÷ 39,950 ≈ let me see, 34,200 is about 0.856 of 39,950. Because 0.85 * 39,950 = approx 34, 0.85*40,000=34,000, so 34,200 would be 0.855.

Wait, more accurately: 39,950.08 * 0.856 ≈ 34,200. So Cl ≈ 0.856.

Looking at the options, let's check the first part of each option. Option A is 0.85, option B is 0.80, C is 0.95, D is 0.70, E is 0.78, F is 1.00, G is 0.90, H is 0.75, I is 0.60, J is 0.65.

So 0.856 is closest to 0.85, which is option A, or perhaps 0.86 isn't present. Wait, let me check if I made any calculation errors.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the denominator more accurately.

Let me recompute ρ * V² * S.

ρ = 0.076 lbm/ft³ = 0.076 / 32.174 slugs/ft³ ≈ 0.00236 slugs/ft³.

V = 230 ft/s, so V² = 230^2 = 52,900 ft²/s².

So ρ*V² = 0.00236 * 52,900 = let's compute this.

0.00236 * 52,900 = ?

Calculating:

52,900 * 0.002 = 105.8.

52,900 * 0.0003 = 15.87.

52,900 * 0.00006 = 3.174.

Wait, but wait, 0.00236 is 0.002 + 0.0003 + 0.00006.

Wait, wait, 0.00236 is 0.002 + 0.00036.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 52,900 * 0.00236 as 52,900 * (0.002 + 0.0003 + 0.00006) = 52,900 * 0.00236.

Alternatively, 52,900 * 0.00236.

Let me compute 52,900 * 0.002 = 105.8.

52,900 * 0.0003 = 15.87.

52,900 * 0.00006 = 3.174.

So adding up: 105.8 +15.87=121.67 +3.174=124.844.

So that's correct.

Then multiply by 320: 124.844 * 320.

Let me compute 124.844 * 300 = 37,453.2.

124.844 * 20 = 2,496.88.

37,453.2 + 2,496.88 = 39,950.08.

So denominator is 39,950.08.

Lift from wings is 17,100 lbf.

So Cl = (2 * 17,100) / 39,950.08.

2 *17,100 = 34,200.

34,200 / 39,950.08 ≈ let's compute it more accurately.

39,950.08 goes into 34,200 how many times?

Well, 39,950.08 * 0.857 ≈ 34,200.

Because 0.8 * 39,950.08 = 31,960.064.

0.05 * 39,950.08 = 1,997.504.

0.007 * 39,950.08 ≈ 279.65056.

Adding those: 31,960.064 + 1,997.504 = 33,957.568 + 279.65056 ≈ 34,237.22, which is a bit over 34,200. So 0.857 is a bit too high. So perhaps approximately 0.856.

So Cl ≈ 0.856, which is approximately 0.86, but the options have 0.85 (A) and 0.90 (G), 0.80 (B), etc.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check the lift equation.

Wait, the lift equation is L = 0.5 * rho * V^2 * S * Cl.

So rearranged, Cl = (2L) / (rho * V^2 * S).

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the density conversion. Let me recheck that.

Wait, 1 slug is 32.174 lbm·s⁻²·ft⁻¹, so to convert from lbm/ft³ to slugs/ft³, we divide by 32.174 lbm/slug.

So 0.076 lbm/ft³ = 0.076 / 32.174 ≈ 0.00236 slugs/ft³. Yes, that's correct.

Wait another thought: maybe the problem is using lbm/ft³ directly without converting, but that would be incorrect because the unit for density in the lift equation must be in slugs/ft³. So I think I did that correctly.

So Cl ≈ 0.856, which is approximately 0.86. The closest option is A: 0.85.

But wait, perhaps I should carry more precise numbers.

Wait, let me compute 34,200 / 39,950.08 more accurately.

Compute 39,950.08 * 0.856:

0.8 * 39,950.08 = 31,960.064.

0.05 * 39,950.08 = 1,997.504.

0.006 * 39,950.08 = 239.7005.

Adding those: 31,960.064 + 1,997.504 = 33,957.568 + 239.7005 = 34,197.2685.

Which is very close to 34,200. So 0.856 gives 34,197.27, which is just 2.73 less than 34,200. So 0.856 would give 34,197.27, so to reach 34,200, perhaps it's 0.856 + (2.73 / 39,950.08).

Wait, 2.73 divided by 39,950.08 is approximately 0.0000683.

So Cl ≈ 0.8560683, which is approximately 0.8561.

So approximately 0.856.

Looking at the options, the closest is A: 0.85, but that's 0.85, which is 0.006 less than 0.856.

Alternatively, perhaps the options rounded to two decimal places. So 0.856 would round to 0.86, but none of the options have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate with more precise numbers.

Wait, let me compute 0.076 lbm/ft³ to slugs/ft³:

0.076 ÷ 32.174 = ?

Let me compute this more accurately.

32.174 × 0.00236 = ?

Wait, 32.174 × 0.002 = 0.064348.

32.174 × 0.00036 = Let's compute 32.174 × 0.0003 = 0.0096522, and 32.174 × 0.00006=0.00193044. So total 0.0096522 + 0.00193044 = 0.01158264.

So 0.00236 slugs/ft³ would be 0.064348 + 0.01158264 = 0.07593064 lbm/ft³, which is very close to 0.076 lbm/ft³.

So the density is correct as 0.00236 slugs/ft³.

Now, let me recompute Cl with more precise numbers.

Cl = (2 * 17,100) / (0.00236 * 230^2 * 320).

Compute denominator:

0.00236 * 230^2 = 0.00236 * 52,900 = let's compute 52,900 * 0.00236.

Compute 52,900 × 0.002 = 105.8.

52,900 × 0.0003 = 15.87.

52,900 × 0.00006 = 3.174.

Wait, 0.00236 is 0.002 + 0.0003 + 0.00006.

So 105.8 + 15.87 + 3.174 = 124.844.

Then multiply by 320: 124.844 × 320.

Compute 124.844 × 300 = 37,453.2.

124.844 × 20 = 2,496.88.

Total: 37,453.2 + 2,496.88 = 39,950.08.

So denominator is 39,950.08.

Numerator: 2 × 17,100 = 34,200.

So Cl = 34,200 / 39,950.08 ≈ 0.856.

So approximately 0.856, which is closest to option A: 0.85 (0.85) or perhaps option E: 0.78 is too low, option G is 0.90, which is higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement. Let me read again.

Wait, the question says the tailplane contributes 5% of the total lift force. So total lift is 18,000 lbf.

So wings contribute 95% of 18,000 lbf, which is 17,100 lbf.

Wait, but perhaps I should double-check that. Let me think: if the tailplane provides 5% of the lift, then yes, the wings provide 95%.

Alternatively, sometimes in some contexts, the tailplane (horizontal stabilizer) might produce negative lift, but in this problem, it's stated as contributing 5% of the total lift force, implying positive lift. So that's correct.

So Cl ≈ 0.856, so the closest option is A: 0.85.

Wait, but perhaps the exact calculation gives something else. Let me try to compute 34,200 / 39,950.08 precisely.

Using a calculator approach: 34,200 ÷ 39,950.08.

Let me compute 39,950.08 × 0.856 = 34,197.27 as before.

So the difference between 34,200 and 34,197.27 is 2.73.

So 2.73 / 39,950.08 ≈ 0.0000683.

So Cl ≈ 0.856 + 0.0000683 ≈ 0.8560683.

So approximately 0.8561.

Looking at the options, none of them have 0.86. So the closest is option A: 0.85, but perhaps I should check if any of the options have a Cl near 0.856. Let me see:

Option A: 0.85,

Option E: 0.78,

Option G: 0.90,

Option C: 0.95,

Hmm, so option A is 0.85, which is the closest to 0.856.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the assumption. Let me think again: perhaps the tailplane is contributing 5% of the total lift, but the lift from the wings is 95%, but maybe I should consider that the total lift is 18,000 lbf, so the wings' lift is 0.95 * 18,000 = 17,100 lbf.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should try using more precise numbers for the density.

Wait, 0.076 lbm/ft³ is exactly 0.076 / 32.174 = approximately 0.0023598 slugs/ft³.

Let me compute 0.0023598 * 230^2 * 320.

Compute 230^2 = 52,900.

0.0023598 * 52,900 = let's compute this.

0.0023598 * 52,900.

0.002 * 52,900 = 105.8.

0.0003598 * 52,900.

Compute 0.0003 *52,900=15.87.

0.0000598 *52,900≈ 3.165.

So 15.87 +3.165=19.035.

So total is 105.8 +19.035=124.835.

Then multiply by 320: 124.835 *320.

124.835 *300=37,450.5,

124.835 *20=2,496.7,

Total=37,450.5+2,496.7=39,947.2.

So denominator is 39,947.2.

Cl=(2*17,100)/39,947.2=34,200/39,947.2≈0.856.

Same result.

So Cl≈0.856. So the closest option is A:0.85.

Wait, but perhaps I should check whether the problem expects Cl to be higher. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I missed that the tailplane also produces lift, so maybe the total
