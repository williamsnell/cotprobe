Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the net price of a pinball machine after a discount. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The list price is $900, and there's a 25% discount. Hmm, I remember discounts are subtracted from the original price to get the net price. So first, I think I need to find out what 25% of $900 is and then subtract that from $900.

Wait, percentages can sometimes trip me up. Let me make sure. 25% is like a quarter, right? So a quarter of 900... let me calculate that. 900 divided by 4. Hmm, 900 divided by 4 is 225. So the discount amount is $225.

So then, the net price would be the original price minus the discount. That's 900 minus 225. Let me do that subtraction. 900 minus 200 is 700, and then minus another 25 is 675. So 675 dollars.

Looking at the options, I see option I is $675. So I think that's the correct answer. But wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Another way to calculate the net price is to find the percentage of the original price that you pay after the discount. Since it's a 25% discount, you're paying 75% of the original price. So 75% of 900 is 0.75 times 900.

Let me compute 0.75 * 900. 900 times 0.75 is the same as 900 * (3/4), which is (900/4)*3. 900 divided by 4 is 225, and 225 times 3 is 675. Yep, same result.

So both methods give me $675. I'm pretty confident that's the right answer. Looking at the options again, option I is $675, so that must be it.

The net price is calculated by subtracting the discount from the list price. The discount is 25% of $900, which equals $225. Subtracting this from $900 gives $675. 

Option I is $675, so the correct answer is:

I: $675

Answer: I
