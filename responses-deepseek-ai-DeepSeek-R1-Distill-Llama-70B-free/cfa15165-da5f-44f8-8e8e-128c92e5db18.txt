Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the heat required to change ice at -10°C to steam at 100°C. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with phase changes and temperature changes, there are a few steps involved. Let me try to break this down.

First, I think the process has three main parts. The first part is warming up the ice from -10°C to 0°C. Then, melting the ice into water at 0°C. And finally, heating that water up to 100°C to make steam. Oh wait, but wait, no—steam is at 100°C, but when water turns to steam, that's a phase change at 100°C, right? So actually, after heating the water to 100°C, we also need to vaporize it.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. The problem says changing ice at -10°C to steam at 100°C. So the steps are: 

1. Raise the temperature of ice from -10°C to 0°C.
2. Melt the ice into water at 0°C.
3. Raise the temperature of the water from 0°C to 100°C.
4. Vaporize the water into steam at 100°C.

So four steps in total, each requiring some heat. Each of these steps has a specific formula to calculate the heat involved.

I remember that the formula for heat when changing temperature is Q = m * c * ΔT. And for phase changes, it's Q = m * L, where L is the latent heat.

Now, I need to know the specific heat capacities and the latent heats for water and ice. Let me try to recall those values.

The specific heat capacity of ice (c_ice) is about 2100 J/(kg·°C), but wait, I think in some contexts it's 2100 J/kg°C. Then the specific heat of water (c_water) is 4186 J/(kg·°C) or sometimes approximated as 4200. Oh, but wait, sometimes I've seen it as 4.186 kJ/kg°C, which is the same as 4186 J.

Latent heat of fusion (L_fusion) is the amount of heat needed to melt ice into water without changing temperature. I think that's about 334,000 J/kg or 334 kJ/kg.

And the latent heat of vaporization (L_vapor) is the heat needed to turn water into steam at 100°C. That's a much larger number. I remember it's around 2260 kJ/kg or 2,260,000 J/kg.

But wait, the problem gives the options in Calories (Cal), so I need to convert from Joules to Calories. I remember that 1 Calorie (with a capital C, as in food Calorie) is equal to 1 kilocalorie (kcal), which is 4184 Joules. So 1 kcal = 4184 J.

But wait, sometimes in physics, the lowercase 'cal' is used where 1 cal = 4.184 J, and 1 Cal (food Calorie) is 1000 of those, so 4184 J. So I need to make sure I'm using the right conversion here.

The problem says "Cal" with a capital C, which I think refers to kilocalories, so 1 Cal = 4184 J.

So, the mass given is 25 kg. Let me jot down all the steps and calculate each Q.

Step 1: Heating ice from -10°C to 0°C.
Q1 = m * c_ice * ΔT
ΔT here is 0 - (-10) = 10°C
So Q1 = 25 kg * 2100 J/kg°C * 10°C = 25 * 2100 * 10 = let's calculate that.

25 * 2100 = 52,500. Multiply by 10 gives 525,000 J.

Wait, wait, 25 * 2100 is actually 25 * 2000 =50,000 and 25*100=2,500, so total 52,500. Multiply by 10: 525,000 J, which is 525 kJ.

Step 2: Melting ice at 0°C to water at 0°C.
Q2 = m * L_fusion
L_fusion is 334,000 J/kg
So Q2 = 25 kg * 334,000 J/kg = 25 * 334,000.

Let me compute that: 334,000 * 25. 334 *25=8,350, so 8,350,000 J, which is 8,350 kJ.

Step 3: Heating water from 0°C to 100°C.
Q3 = m * c_water * ΔT
ΔT is 100 - 0 = 100°C
c_water is 4186 J/kg°C
So Q3 = 25 kg * 4186 J/kg°C * 100°C
Calculate that:

25 * 4186 = let's see. 4000 *25 =100,000, 186*25=4,650. So total 104,650. Multiply by 100 gives 10,465,000 J, which is 10,465 kJ.

Step 4: Vaporizing water at 100°C to steam at 100°C.
Q4 = m * L_vapor
L_vapor is 2,260,000 J/kg (since 1 kJ is 1000 J, so 2260 kJ/kg is 2,260,000 J/kg)
So Q4 = 25 kg * 2,260,000 J/kg = 25 * 2,260,000.

25 * 2,260,000: 2,260,000 *25 = 56,500,000 J, which is 56,500 kJ.

Now, summing all the Qs.

Q1: 525 kJ
Q2: 8,350 kJ
Q3: 10,465 kJ
Q4: 56,500 kJ

Total Q = 525 + 8,350 = 8,875; plus 10,465 gives 19,340; plus 56,500 gives 75,840 kJ.

Wait, wait, let me add step by step.

525 + 8,350 = 8,875 kJ
8,875 + 10,465 = 19,340 kJ
19,340 +56,500 = 75,840 kJ.

Wait, 75,840 kJ is the total heat in kilojoules. Now, since 1 Cal (kilocalorie) is 4.184 kJ, I think. Wait, no: 1 kcal = 4184 J, which is 4.184 kJ.

So to convert kJ to kcal, we divide by 4.184, right?

Wait, no, wait. 1 kcal = 4184 J = 4.184 kJ. So 1 kJ = 1/4.184 kcal ≈ 0.239 kcal.

So to convert 75,840 kJ to kcal, divide by 4.184.

So 75,840 kJ / 4.184 kJ per kcal ≈ ?

Let me compute that.

75,840 / 4.184 ≈ let's approximate.

First, 75,840 /4 =18,960

But 4.184 is a bit more than 4, so the result will be a bit less than 18,960.

Compute 4.184 * 18,000 = ?

4 * 18,000 =72,000

0.184 *18,000=3,312 → total 75,312.

So 4.184 *18,000 =75,312.

But we have 75,840. The difference is 75,840 -75,312 =528.

So 528 /4.184 ≈ about 126. So total is 18,000 + 126 = 18,126 kcal.

Wait, but let me double-check that division.

Alternatively, 75,840 /4.184 ≈ ?

Let me compute 75,840 ÷4.184.

Well, 4.184 × 18,000 = 75,312 (as before).

Subtract: 75,840 -75,312 =528.

So 528 ÷4.184 = approx 528 /4.184 ≈ 126.16

So total is 18,000 + 126.16 ≈ 18,126.16 kcal, which is approximately 18,126 Cal.

But looking at the options:

Options are:

A:21,000 Cal

B:15,000

C:23,000

D:16,000

E:18,000

F:25,000

G:22,500

H:17,500

I:20,000

J:19,000

Hmm, so my calculation gives approximately 18,126 Cal, which is about 18,100. The closest option is E:18,000 Cal.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations in case I made a mistake somewhere.

Let me re-calculate each step's Q.

Step 1: 25 kg * 2100 J/kg°C *10°C =25 *21000=525,000 J (525 kJ). Correct.

Step 2:25 *334,000=8,350,000 J (8,350 kJ). Correct.

Step3:25*4186 *100=25 *4186=104,650 → *100=10,465,000 J (10,465 kJ). Correct.

Step4:25 *2,260,000=56,500,000 J (56,500 kJ). Correct.

Total: 525 +8,350=8,875 → +10,465=19,340 → +56,500=75,840 kJ.

Convert to Cal: 75,840 kJ ÷4.184 kJ/Cal ≈.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Let me compute 75,840 ÷4.184.

I can write it as:

4.184 × x =75,840.

x=75,840 /4.184.

Let me compute 75840 ÷4.184.

First, let's see how many times 4.184 fits into 75840.

Well, 4.184 ×18,000 =75,312 as before.

75,840 -75,312=528.

So 528 ÷4.184: Let's compute this.

4.184 *126 = ?

4 *126=504

0.184 *126 = approx 23.184 → 504 +23.184=527.184.

So 4.184 *126=527.184.

So 528 is 0.816 more than 527.184.

So 126 + (0.816/4.184) → 0.816 /4.184 ≈0.195.

So total x=18,000 +126 +0.195≈18,126.195 Cal.

Approximately 18,126 Cal.

Looking at the options, E is 18,000. That's the closest. But wait, let me check if perhaps I made an error in the specific heat or latent heat values.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the specific heat of ice. Because sometimes I see it as 2100 J/kg°C, but maybe it's 2100 J/kg°C. Or was it 2000?

Wait, another source says the specific heat capacity of ice is approximately 2.09×10³ J/kg·°C, which is 2090 J/kg°C. But I used 2100, which is close enough.

Similarly, latent heat of fusion is about 334 kJ/kg. That's standard.

Latent heat of vaporization is 2260 kJ/kg. Also correct.

Specific heat of water is 4.186×10³ J/kg°C, which is what I used.

So perhaps the calculation is correct. But the options don't have 18,126. So the closest is E:18,000.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is 18,000. So that's the answer.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier. Let me recheck the numbers.

Wait, another approach: calculate each step in Calories directly.

Since 1 Cal =4184 J, so 1 J =1/4184 Cal.

So let's compute each step in Calories.

Step1: Q1 =525,000 J → 525,000 /4184 ≈?

Well, 4184 ×125 = 4184*100=418,400; 4184*25=104,600 → total 522,900 + (4184*25)= 4184*125=522,  wait, 4184 *125: 4184 *100 =418,400; 4184 *25=104,600. So 418,400 +104,600=522,  522,  418,400+104,600=522, that can't be right. Wait, 4184 ×125: 4184 *100=418,400, 4184 *25=104,600. So total 522,  418,400 +104,600=522,000? No, 418,400 + 104,600 is 523,000.

So 4184 ×125 = 523,000 J.

So 525,000 J is 125 ×4184 + (525,000-523,000)=2000 J.

So 2000 J /4184 J/Cal ≈0.478 Cal.

So Q1≈125.478 Cal.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no: 4184 J =1 Cal.

So 525,000 J =525,000 /4184 ≈125.6 Cal.

Wait, 4184 ×125 =523,000 → 525,000-523,000=2,000.

So 2,000 /4184 ≈0.478 → 125.478 Cal.

Wait, but that's way different than before. Wait, no, no, no. I think I messed up my units.

Wait, no: 1 Cal =4184 J, so 1 J =1/4184 Cal.

So, 525,000 J is 525,000 /4184 = approx 125.5 Cal.

Wait, but earlier I had 525,000 J for Q1, which is 525 kJ, and when converted to Cal, it's about 125.5 Cal.

Wait, but earlier, when I summed all the Qs in kJ and converted to Cal, I got around 18,126 Cal. But when converting each step to Cal, that's way smaller.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused between kJ and J.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute each step in Calories, using the correct conversion.

Because 1 Cal =4184 J.

So step 1: 525,000 J =525,000 /4184 ≈125.5 Cal.

Step2:8,350,000 J →8,350,000 /4184 ≈1992.5 Cal.

Step3:10,465,000 J →10,465,000 /4184 ≈2500 Cal?

Wait, let me compute each step:

Step1: 525,000 J → 525,000 /4184 ≈125.5 Cal.

Step2:8,350,000 J →8,350,000 /4184 → let's calculate 8,350,000 ÷4184.

Well, 4184 ×2000=8,368,000, which is higher than 8,350,000. So 8,350,000 ÷4184 ≈1992.5 Cal.

Wait, 4184 ×1990= ?

Well, 4184 ×2000=8,368,000 → subtract 4184 ×10=41,840 → 8,368,000-41,840=8,326,160.

But wait, 8,350,000 is higher than 8,326,160.

So 8,350,000 -8,326,160=23,840.

So 23,840 /4184≈5.695 → so total is 1990 +5.695 ≈1995.695, approx 1995.7 Cal.

Step3:10,465,000 J →10,465,000 /4184 → let's compute.

4184 ×2500=4184*2000=8,368,000 +4184*500=2,092,000 → total 10,460,000.

So 10,465,000 -10,460,000=5,000.

5,000 /4184≈1.195 → so total 2500 +1.195≈2501.195 Cal.

Step4:56,500,000 J →56,500,000 /4184 → compute.

4184 ×13,500 = ?

Well, 4184 ×10,000=41,840,000.

4184 ×3,500= let's compute 4184×3000=12,552,000 and 4184×500=2,092,000 → total 12,552,000 +2,092,000=14,644,000.

So 10,000+3,500=13,500 → 41,840,000 +14,644,000=56,484,000.

So 56,500,000 -56,484,000=16,000.

16,000 /4184≈3.823 → so total is 13,500 +3.823≈13,503.823 Cal.

Now adding all four steps:

Step1: ~125.5 Cal

Step2: ~1995.7 → total 125.5+1995.7=2121.2

Step3: ~2501.2 → 2121.2 +2501.2=4622.4

Step4: ~13,503.8 → 4622.4 +13,503.8=18,126.2 Cal.

So about 18,126.2 Cal, which aligns with the previous calculation.

So the closest option is E:18,000 Cal. But wait, none of the options exactly match, but E is 18,000, which is the closest.

Looking back at the options:

E:18,000 Cal.

Yes, so the answer should be E.

To calculate the heat required to change 25 kg of ice at -10°C to steam at 100°C, the process involves four steps:

1. **Heating the ice from -10°C to 0°C**:  
   Using the formula \( Q = m \cdot c \cdot \Delta T \), where \( c_{\text{ice}} = 2100 \, \text{J/(kg·°C)} \):  
   \[
   Q_1 = 25 \cdot 2100 \cdot 10 =
