Okay, so I have this question about barriers to the diffusion of cultural traits. Hmm, I need to figure out which option is NOT considered a barrier. Let me think about each option one by one.

The question gives options A through G. Barriers to diffusion can be both physical and cultural. Physical barriers are like natural features that make it hard for people to move or communicate. Cultural barriers are things like different languages or beliefs that might prevent the spread of traits.

Option A is mountain ranges. I remember that mountains can definitely act as barriers because they're hard to cross. Like, the Himalayas between India and Tibet. So that's a physical barrier.

Option B is oceans. Oceans are big bodies of water that can separate land masses. Before modern transportation, crossing oceans was really difficult, so they definitely act as barriers. So B is a barrier.

Option C is religion. Religion is a cultural aspect. If two groups have different religions, it might be harder for cultural traits to spread between them because they might not interact as much or might resist each other's practices. So religion is a barrier.

Option D is tolerant complaisant citizens. Wait, what does that mean? Tolerant means open-minded, and complaisant is like being willing to please or agree. So if people are tolerant and complaisant, they might be more accepting of new cultural traits. That would actually help diffusion, not hinder it. So this wouldn't be a barrier.

Option E is distance. Distance is definitely a barrier. The farther apart people are, the less likely they are to interact and share cultural traits. So E is a barrier.

Option F is dense forests. Dense forests can be physical barriers because they're hard to traverse, limiting movement and thus diffusion. So F is a barrier.

Option G is language. Language differences can be a big barrier. If people can't communicate easily, cultural exchange is harder. So G is a barrier.

So the question is asking which is NOT a barrier. All the options except D are barriers. So the answer must be D.

The question asks which option is NOT a barrier to the diffusion of cultural traits. Barriers can be physical (e.g., natural features) or cultural (e.g., language, religion). 

- **A: Mountain ranges** are physical barriers that hinder movement and diffusion.  
- **B: Oceans** are physical barriers that separate land masses and impede interaction.  
- **C: Religion** is a cultural barrier that can inhibit the spread of traits between groups with differing beliefs.  
- **D: Tolerant complaisant citizens** are open-minded and accepting, which facilitates diffusion rather than hindering it.  
- **E: Distance** is a barrier because it reduces interaction and cultural exchange.  
- **F: Dense forests** are physical barriers that limit movement and diffusion.  
- **G: Language** is a cultural barrier that makes communication and cultural exchange difficult.  

The only option that is not a barrier is **D: Tolerant complaisant citizens**, as their openness promotes diffusion rather than restricting it.  

Answer: D
