Okay, so I have this physics problem here about gratings and the intensity ratio between a primary maximum and the first secondary maximum. Hmm, I remember that gratings are related to diffraction, and the number of lines affects the intensity of the maxima. Let me think.

The question says the grating has 100 lines. I'm trying to recall the formula for the intensity in a diffraction grating. Oh right, the intensity of a maximum is given by I = I_0 * (sin(N * β) / sin(β))^2, where N is the number of lines, and β is the phase difference for each slit.

Wait, the primary maximum occurs when β is zero. But for the secondary maxima, β is not zero. So the primary maximum's intensity is when sin(Nβ) is the maximum because sin(0) is zero, but the limit as β approaches zero gives us N^2 I_0. Because, let me think, when β approaches zero, sin(Nβ) ≈ Nβ, and sin(β) ≈ β. So (sin(Nβ)/sinβ) ≈ N. Squared, it's N². So the primary intensity I_p is proportional to N².

For the secondary maxima, the first one occurs near β = π/N or something like that. Wait, actually, the secondary maxima are approximately halfway between the zeros, which are at β = π/(N) * m, where m is an integer. So the first secondary maximum is between the primary and the first zero.

Wait, let me get this straight. The intensity for any maximum (including secondary) is given by that formula. So for a secondary maximum, the denominator sinβ is roughly a value, and the numerator is sin(Nβ). But for secondary maxima, Nβ is approximately (n + ½)π, perhaps? I'm a bit hazy on that.

Wait, maybe I should think about the amplitude first. The amplitude is proportional to sin(Nβ)/sinβ. The intensity is the square of that. So for the primary maximum, when β is 0, the amplitude is N, so intensity is N².

For the secondary maximum, the amplitude is much smaller. So we need to find the maximum value of sin(Nβ)/sinβ when β isn't zero. Let's take the first secondary maximum, which is the first peak after the primary. So when Nβ is around π. Wait, the first zero occurs at β = π/N, so the first secondary maximum is between β=0 and β= π/N? No, wait no, the first zero is at β = π/N, so the first secondary is between β= π/N and β=2π/N? Or the other way around.

Wait, no. The primary maximum is at β=0. The first zero is at β= π/N. So the first secondary would be between β=π/(2N) and β=π/N. Wait, I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps the first secondary maximum occurs at β= 3π/(2N), but I'm not sure. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I can approximate the intensity at the first secondary maximum. Let's say β is small but not zero. Let me model the first secondary maximum as when Nβ is approximately π. Because, the zeros in the diffraction pattern occur when Nβ = mπ, where m is an integer. So the first zero is at m=1, which is β= π/N. The next zero is at β= 2π/N, and so on.

The secondary maxima occur between these zeros. So between m=1 and m=2, so β between π/N and 2π/N. But wait, that can't be because the primary is at β=0. So perhaps the first secondary is between β=0 and β=π/N, but that would be before the first zero, which can't be right because the first zero is at β= π/N. So the first secondary maximum must be right after the first zero, between m=1 and m=2.

Wait, no, the primary maximum is a very sharp peak at β=0. The first minimum is at β= π/N. So the first secondary maximum would be at β= (3π)/(2N), perhaps? Because that's midway between the first and second zeros.

Wait, perhaps I should model this with calculus. The intensity I is proportional to (sin(Nβ)/sinβ)^2. To find the maxima, take the derivative of I with respect to β and set it to zero.

But that's a bit complicated. Alternatively, I've heard that the secondary maxima have an intensity of approximately 1/(N^2) times the primary maximum. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right because the primary is N^2 times the single slit intensity. So the secondary maxima would be much smaller.

Wait, I remember that the ratio of the primary maximum to the first secondary maximum is roughly (N/(π))^2, but I'm not sure.

Wait another approach. Let's consider the formula I = I_0 (sin(Nβ)/sinβ)^2.

At the primary maximum, β=0, so sin(Nβ) ~ Nβ, sinβ ~ β. So ratio squared is N². So I_p ~ N².

At the first secondary maximum, which is the first peak after the primary. Let's approximate where this occurs. Let me think, the first secondary maximum occurs when Nβ is approximately π. Because between the first zero (β=π/N) and the second zero (β=2π/N), the maximum occurs at β= (3π)/(2N). Wait, because the secondary maxima are approximately at β = (m + ½) π / N for integer m. So the first secondary would be m=1, so β= (3π)/(2N).

Putting that into the amplitude formula: sin(Nβ) = sin(3π/2) = -1.

sin(beta) = sin(3π/(2N)) ≈ 3π/(2N), since 3π/(2N) is small when N is large (like 100).

So the amplitude is (-1) / (3π/(2N)) ) = (-2N)/(3π).

So the intensity is ( (2N)/(3π) )^2.

So the ratio of primary to secondary is (N^2) / ( (4N^2)/(9 π^2) ) ) = (9 π^2)/(4) ≈ (9 * 9.8696)/4 ≈ (88.826)/4 ≈ 22.206.

Wait, that can't be, because the ratio would be about 22. So the primary is 22 times more intense than the first secondary.

But wait, the options are all less than 1. So perhaps I've misunderstood the question. Oh wait, the question is the ratio of the primary maximum to the first secondary. So I_p / I_s = (N^2) / ( (4 N^2)/(9 π^2) ) ) = (9 π^2)/(4) ≈ 22.2. So the primary is about 22 times more intense than the first secondary. But the options are in the range of 0.005 to 0.095. So 1/22 is about 0.0455. So maybe the question is asking for the inverse, the ratio of the first secondary to the primary? Because 0.045 is one of the options (option B:0.045).

Wait, the question says: ratio of the intensity of a primary maximum to that of the first secondary maximum. So I_p / I_s = 22. So the answer is 22, but that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe the first secondary maximum isn't where I thought. Let me think again. Perhaps the first secondary maximum occurs when Nβ = π/2. So when Nβ = π/2, β= π/(2N). Then:

sin(Nβ) = sin(π/2) = 1.

sin(beta) = sin(π/(2N)) ≈ π/(2N).

So the amplitude is 1 / (π/(2N)) )= 2N/π.

Intensity is (2N/π)^2 = (4 N²)/(π²).

Wait, but that would make the intensity of first secondary much higher than primary. Because primary is N², and this is (4/π²) N², which is approximately 0.405 N², which is 40% of primary. So that would make the primary about 2.46 times the first secondary. But that doesn't fit with the options either.

Wait, perhaps I should instead think about the exact formula for the secondary maxima. The maxima occur where the derivative of (sin(Nβ)/sinβ)^2 is zero. Let me compute that.

Let me set f(β) = [sin(Nβ)/sinβ]^2.

Compute derivative f’(β) and set to zero.

But maybe instead, I can look for the maximum points, which I think occur near (m + ½) π / N for m=1,2,... So let's take m=1, so β ≈ (3π/2)/N.

So Nβ ≈ 3π/2.

So:

sin(Nβ) = sin(3π/2) = -1.

sin(β) = sin(3π/(2N)) ≈ 3π/(2N), since N is 100, so 3π/(200) is small.

So sin(Nβ)/sinβ ≈ (-1) / (3π/(2N)) ) = (-2N)/(3π).

So the amplitude is (2N)/(3π), so intensity is (4 N²)/(9 π²).

Thus, I_p is N², I_s is (4 N²)/(9 π²).

So the ratio I_p/I_s = (N²) / (4 N²/(9 π²) ) ) = 9 π² /4.

Calculate 9 * (π squared) divided by 4.

π squared is about 9.8696. So 9 * 9.8696 = 88.8264. Divided by 4 gives approx 22.2066.

So the ratio is about 22.2:1. So the primary is 22 times more intense than the first secondary.

But the question asks for the ratio of primary maximum to first secondary, which is 22.2. But none of the options are that. The options are all fractions. So perhaps I have this inverted.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should instead have the ratio of the first secondary to the primary. That would be 1/22.2, which is approximately 0.045, which is option B.

So that would make sense. Because the question is phrased as primary to secondary, but if I got the reciprocal, that would fit. Hmm, but I'm a bit confused. Let me recheck.

Wait, the problem says, "the ratio of the intensity of a primary maximum to that of the first secondary maximum." So I_p / I_s = 22.2, so the ratio is 22.2. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps in the problem, the intensity ratio is I_s/I_p, which would be 1/22.2≈0.045, which is option B.

But that contradicts the question's wording. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I confused the numerator and denominator in the formula. Let me recalculate the I_s and I_p.

I_p = (sin(N*0)/sin(0))^2, but that's undefined, but in the limit, it's N^2.

I_s is when Nβ is 3π/2, as I took earlier. So I_s = [sin(3π/2)/sin(3π/(2N))]^2.

Which is [ (-1) / (3π/(2N)) ]^2 = (2N/(3π))^2.

So I_s = (4 N²)/(9 π²).

So I_p is N², so I_p/I_s = (N²) / (4 N²/(9 π²)) ) = (9 π²)/(4) ≈ 22.2.

But the options are all decimal fractions less than 1, so perhaps the question actually asks for the inverse, or perhaps I have a mistake.

Wait, maybe the first secondary maximum isn't where I thought. Let me think again. Perhaps the first secondary maximum occurs when Nβ = π/2. So when Nβ = π/2, β= π/(2N). Then:

sin(Nβ) = 1, sin(β)= sin(π/(2N))≈ π/(2N).

So amplitude is 1/(π/(2N))= 2N/π.

Intensity: (2N/π)^2 = 4 N²/π².

Then, I_p = N², I_s = 4 N²/π².

So I_p/I_s = (N²) / (4 N²/π²) ) = π²/4 ≈ (9.8696)/4 ≈ 2.467.

So the ratio is about 2.467:1. So the primary is about 2.467 times the first secondary maximum. So I_p/I_s is ~2.467. The inverse would be ~0.405.

But the options don't include that either.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Another method I recall is that for multiple-slit interference, the intensity of the secondary maxima is approximately 1/(N^2) times the primary maximum. Wait, but that can't be right because when N is large, the secondary maxima become negligible.

Wait, another approach: the maximum intensity of the secondary maxima is (2/(3π))^2 times the primary intensity.

Wait, that would mean I_s = (4/(9 π²)) I_p.

So the ratio I_p/I_s is (9 π²)/4 ≈ 22.2. So same as before.

But how does that translate into the options given?

Wait, the options are all fractions, so perhaps the question is actually asking for the inverse, perhaps the secondary over primary, which would be 1/22.2 ≈ 0.045, which is option B.

But the question says, "the ratio of the intensity of a primary maximum to that of the first secondary maximum," which is I_p/I_s, which is 22.2. So 22.2 isn't an option. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the grating equation is different. Maybe I should think in terms of the single slit versus multiple slits.

Wait, another thought: the formula for the intensity of secondary maxima in a grating is given by I = I_0 (sin α / (N sin β))^2, where α is the phase difference per slit, and β is the phase difference for each slit.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the variables here. Let me get this straight.

In a diffraction grating, the condition for maxima is d sinθ = m λ, where m is the order. But the intensity is given by I = I_0 (sin(N β) / sin β )^2, where β = (π d sinθ)/λ.

So, for the primary maxima, β=0 (or m=0). The first secondary maximum would be the next peak after the primary, which is not at m=1 because that's a zero.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the first secondary maximum when m=1/2, but that's not possible because m must be an integer. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the first secondary maximum occurs near β=π/(N). But that's where the first zero is. So perhaps the first secondary maximum is just before the first zero, at β= (π/(N)) (1 - δ), where δ is a small number.

Wait, perhaps using an approximation for the first secondary maximum, where Nβ is approx (π/2), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs at Nβ = (m + ½) π, which for m=1 would be 3π/2, as I thought earlier.

Wait, given that I'm not making progress, perhaps I should look up the standard formula for the ratio of primary to secondary maxima in a grating.

Wait, I think the standard result is that the ratio is (N^2) compared to (4/( (3)^2 π^2 )) N^2, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the first secondary maximum's intensity is about (1/22.2) of the primary, so the ratio I_p/I_s is 22.2:1, but since the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is 0.045, which is option B.

Wait, but wait the options are:

A:0.075, B:0.045, C:0.015, D:0.065, E:0.035, F:0.085, G:0.025, H:0.055, I:0.095, J:0.005.

So 0.045 is option B. Therefore, if the ratio is 1/22.2, then 0.045 would be the correct ratio, but that would be if the question was secondary/primary. Since the question is primary/secondary, which is 22.2, but since 22.2 is not an option, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the maximum of the secondary is when Nβ= (m + ½) π, but for m=0, that would be β= π/(2N), which is the first secondary maximum after the primary. So let's compute that.

So Nβ=π/2 → β= π/(2N).

So, sin(Nβ)=sin(π/2)=1.

sin(β)=sin(π/(2N))≈ π/(2N), since N=100 → π/(200)≈0.0157 radians.

So, the amplitude is 1/(π/(2N))= 2N/π.

So the intensity is (2N/π)^2 =4N²/π².

So the intensity of the primary maximum is N², so the ratio I_p/I_s = N²/(4 N²/π²) )= π²/4 ≈ (9.8696)/4≈2.467.

So the primary is about 2.467 times the first secondary. So the ratio I_p/I_s is approximately 2.467:1, which is about 2.47.

But none of the options match that. So maybe I'm missing something else.

Alternatively, perhaps the first secondary maximum occurs at Nβ= (3π/2), which is m=1 in the formula (m + ½)π.

So for m=1, Nβ=3π/2 → β=3π/(2N).

Then, sin(Nβ)=sin(3π/2)= -1.

sin(β)=sin(3π/(2N))≈ 3
