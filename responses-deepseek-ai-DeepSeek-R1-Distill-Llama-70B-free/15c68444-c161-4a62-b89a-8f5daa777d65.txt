Okay, so I've got this problem about a barium titanate capacitor. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on capacitors, but let's see. I remember that the capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor is given by C equals epsilon times area divided by distance. But wait, this isn't a regular parallel plate setup, it's a hollow cylinder that's been cut in half and has electrodes on the two rectangular faces. 

So the material is BaTiO3, which has a high dielectric constant, epsilon_R is 5000. The dimensions are inner radius 1 cm, outer radius 2 cm, and length 3 cm. Oh wait, because it's a cylinder, the area involved here might be the area of the rectangular face after cutting.

Wait, when the cylinder is cut along a diameter, each half would have a rectangular face. The dimensions of that rectangle would be the length of the cylinder and the diameter of the circular cross-section. Oh wait, no, the rectangular face when you split a cylinder along its diameter would have a width equal to the length of the cylinder, and a height equal to the diameter of the circular cross-section. But wait, the cylinder is hollow. So maybe the area is the area of the curved surface?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The capacitor is made by cutting the cylinder in half along a diameter. So each half is a semicircular cylinder. Then, electrodes are deposited on the two rectangular faces of one half. Oh, wait, the two rectangular faces would be the flat surfaces where the cylinder was cut. So each face is a rectangle. The dimensions of these rectangles would be the length of the cylinder (3 cm) and the diameter of the circular cross-section. Wait, because the cylinder's circular cross-section has a diameter of (outer radius - inner radius) times 2? No, wait, the cylinder is hollow with inner radius 1 cm and outer radius 2 cm. So the diameter is 2*(outer radius) = 4 cm. Wait, no, the diameter is from one side to the other, so for the outer edge, it's 4 cm, but the inner is 2 cm. But wait, the cutting is along a diameter, so the rectangle's height (the cut part) would be the length of the cylinder, which is 3 cm, and the width would be the length of the diameter, which is the outer diameter, 4 cm. No, wait, because it's a hollow cylinder, maybe the electrode is placed on the flat face which is a rectangle with length 3 cm and width equal to the difference between outer and inner radii times 2? Or perhaps the width is the diameter of the outer circle.

Wait no, when you cut a cylinder along a diameter, the flat face is a rectangle. The dimensions of that rectangle would be the length of the cylinder (3 cm) and the diameter of the outer circle (4 cm, since radius is 2 cm). But wait, wait, the inner radius is 1 cm and outer is 2 cm, so the diameter at the outer edge is 4 cm, but the inner is 2 cm. So when you split the cylinder, the flat face is a rectangle that's 3 cm long (the length of the cylinder) and 4 cm wide (the diameter). But wait, the actual flat face is across the circular cross-section, so the width is the diameter of the circular face, which for the outer part is 4 cm, but the inner part is 2 cm. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the area of the electrode is the area of the rectangle formed by the length of the cylinder and the length of the diameter of the circular face (so 3 cm by 4 cm).

Wait, but the capacitor is made by cutting the cylinder into two halves. So each half would have a flat face that's a rectangle. So the area of each electrode would be the length times the diameter of the circular cross-section. So diameter is 4 cm (since radius is 2 cm), and length is 3 cm, so area A is 3 cm * 4 cm = 12 cm². But wait, the dielectric is the BaTiO3 material. The distance between the plates would be the separation between the two electrodes, which in this case is the distance across the diameter? No, no. Wait, the electrodes are on the two flat rectangular faces of the same half. Oh wait, no. Wait, the problem says that the capacitor is made by cutting the cylinder in half along a diameter and depositing silver electrodes on the two rectangular faces of one half. So each half has two flat rectangular faces where it was cut. So the two electrodes are on these two faces. So the separation between the plates would be the distance between these two faces, but wait, because each face is on opposite ends of the half-cylinder. Wait, that seems a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the capacitor is formed by the two electrodes on the same half, so the two rectangular faces are on the same piece. So the area of each electrode is the area of one rectangular face. The distance between the plates would then be the length of the other dimension, perhaps. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let's think of the cylinder as a circular cylinder. When you cut it along a diameter, you get two half-cylinders. Each half-cylinder has a rectangular face where it was cut. The two rectangular faces would be on the same half-cylinder? No, each half would have one rectangular face. So if you deposit electrodes on both rectangular faces of one half, meaning the same half, so the two faces are at the two ends of the half-cylinder. So the separation between the two plates would be the length of the cylinder, which is 3 cm. Hmm, but that doesn't sound right because that would make the plates separated by 3 cm, but the dielectric is the material in between, which is the BaTiO3. Wait, but the dielectric is the material of the capacitor, which is the BaTiO3. So the area of the plates is the area of each electrode, which is the rectangular face.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting this mixed up. Let me try to visualize it. The original cylinder has inner radius a=1 cm, outer radius b=2 cm, and length L=3 cm. When cut along a diameter, each half becomes a half-cylinder. The flat face where it was cut is a rectangle with dimensions L (3 cm) by (b - a) * 2? No, wait, the diameter is 2b, which is 4 cm, so the length of the diameter is 4 cm. So the flat face is a rectangle of length L=3 cm and width equal to the diameter of the circular face, which is 4 cm. So the area A of each electrode is 3 cm * 4 cm = 12 cm².

Wait, but the separation between the plates (d) would be the distance across the diameter, which is 4 cm? No, that can't be because the plates are on opposite ends of the same half-cylinder. So the distance between the plates (d) would be the length L, which is 3 cm. Because the two electrodes are on the two ends of the half-cylinder, so their separation is the length of the cylinder.

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because if the plates are on the two ends, then the separation would be the length, but in that case, the dielectric material (BaTiO3) is in between. So the capacitance would be C = (epsilon * epsilon_0 * A) / d.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused because the geometry is a bit unusual. Maybe it's better to model this as a parallel plate capacitor, where the plates are the two rectangular faces of the half-cylinder. So the area A is the area of each face, which is L * (2b), since the diameter is 2b. So A = L * 2b. Substituting, L is 3 cm, and 2b is 4 cm, so A=12 cm². The separation d between the plates is the distance between the two faces, which is the length of the cylinder, 3 cm. Wait no, because the two electrodes are on the same half-cylinder, so the separation would not be the entire length but perhaps something else. Wait, no, if the half-cylinder is 3 cm long, and the electrodes are on the two ends, the plates are separated by 3 cm. But that seems like a very large separation, which would result in a small capacitance, which might not match the options given.

Alternatively, perhaps the separation isn't the length, but the thickness of the dielectric. Wait, the dielectric is the BaTiO3, which is the material of the half-cylinder. So the dielectric thickness would be the distance across the cylinder's wall, which is (outer radius - inner radius) = 1 cm. So d is 1 cm.

Wait, that makes more sense. Because the dielectric is the material between the two plates. So if the plates are on the two flat ends of the half-cylinder, the separation between them (d) would be the distance across the dielectric, which is the radial thickness of the cylinder's wall, which is (outer radius - inner radius) = 1 cm.

So putting it together, the area A is the area of one plate, which is length times the diameter of the circular face (since the flat face is a rectangle of length L and width equal to the diameter). So A = L * (2b) = 3 cm * 4 cm = 12 cm². The separation d is the radial thickness, 1 cm. The relative permittivity epsilon_R is 5000.

So the capacitance C is (epsilon_R * epsilon_0 * A) / d. But wait, I think I might have mixed up the area and the separation. Let me make sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the capacitor is formed between the inner and outer surfaces of the cylinder, but that doesn't seem to fit the problem description, which says electrodes are on the two rectangular faces.

Wait, maybe another approach. When the cylinder is cut in half, the two rectangular faces are each a rectangle of length L (3 cm) and width equal to the length of the diameter of the circular face, which is 4 cm. So each electrode is 3 cm by 4 cm, area 12 cm². The dielectric between them is the BaTiO3 material, and the separation is the distance between the two electrodes, which would be the same as the length of the cylinder because the electrodes are on opposite ends. Wait, but then d would be 3 cm, which seems long.

Alternatively, perhaps the separation is the width of the rectangular face, which is 4 cm. But that would imply d=4 cm, which also seems long. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to model it as a parallel plate capacitor where the area is the area of the rectangular face (3 cm * 4 cm =12 cm²), and the separation is the distance between the two plates, which is the length of the cylinder (3 cm). So then, C = (epsilon_R * epsilon_0 * A) / d.

But wait, the standard formula for a parallel plate capacitor is C = (epsilon * A) / d, where epsilon is the permittivity of the dielectric. Since epsilon = epsilon_R * epsilon_0, that would make C = (epsilon_R * epsilon_0 * A) / d.

So plugging in the numbers:

epsilon_R = 5000,

A = 12 cm² = 12e-4 m² (since 1 cm² = 1e-4 m²),

d = 3 cm = 0.03 m.

Epsilon_0 is 8.85e-12 F/m.

So C = (5000 * 8.85e-12 F/m * 12e-4 m²) / 0.03 m.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, compute numerator:

5000 * 8.85e-12 = let's see, 5000 is 5e3.

5e3 * 8.85e-12 = 5 *8.85 =44.25, so 44.25e-9, which is 4.425e-8.

Multiply by 12e-4 m²: 4.425e-8 * 12e-4 = (4.425 * 12) * 1e-12.

4.425 *12 = let's compute 4 *12=48, 0.425*12=5.1, so total 53.1.

So 53.1e-12 F*m.

Now, divide by d=0.03 m: 53.1e-12 / 0.03 = 53.1 /0.03 = 1770, so 1770e-12 F, which is 1.77e-9 F or 1770 nF. But looking at the options, the highest is 700e-12 F, which is 700 nF. So 1770 is way higher than any option. Hmm, that suggests I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the area or the separation. Maybe the area isn't 12 cm². Let me think again: the electrodes are on the two rectangular faces of the half-cylinder. Each face is a rectangle with dimensions length L=3 cm and width equal to the diameter of the circular face, which is 4 cm. So yes, area is 12 cm². But maybe the separation isn't the length of the cylinder but the thickness of the dielectric, which is the radial difference, 1 cm. So d=1 cm=0.01 m.

Let me recalculate with d=0.01 m.

So C = (5000 * 8.85e-12 * 12e-4) / 0.01.

Compute numerator: 5000 *8.85e-12 = 4.425e-8 as before.

Multiply by 12e-4: 4.425e-8 *12e-4=53.1e-12.

Divide by 0.01: 53.1e-12 /0.01 = 5.31e-9 F, which is 5310 nF. Still way higher than any option. Hmm, something is definitely wrong here.

Wait, maybe the area isn't 12 cm². Let me think again. The area of the rectangular face when you cut a cylinder along a diameter is actually the length times the circumference. Wait, no, that's for the curved surface area. The flat face after cutting is a rectangle whose area is L * (2*r), where r is the radius. Wait, no, when you cut a cylinder of radius r along a diameter, the flat face is a rectangle of length L and width 2r. So in this case, the outer radius is 2 cm, so 2r is 4 cm. So area A = L * 2r = 3 cm *4 cm =12 cm², same as before.

Wait, but maybe the actual area is the area of the annulus, but no, the electrodes are on the flat faces, not on the curved surfaces. So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the capacitor's plates are on the inner and outer surfaces of the cylinder. But the problem states that the electrodes are on the two rectangular faces of one half, so that's not the case.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the half-cylinder's flat face is not 3 cm by 4 cm. Maybe I'm getting the dimensions wrong. Let me think: when you have a hollow cylinder, cutting it along a diameter would give a flat face that's a rectangle with length equal to the length of the cylinder (3 cm) and width equal to the difference in circumference between the outer and inner circles. No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, the width of the flat face would be the diameter of the outer circle, which is 4 cm. So I think A=12 cm² is correct.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the dielectric thickness. If the dielectric is the material between the plates, and the plates are on the two flat ends of the half-cylinder, then the dielectric thickness would be the length of the cylinder, 3 cm. But that gives a very small capacitance. Alternatively, perhaps the dielectric is arranged differently. Maybe the two electrodes are on the same face, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the capacitance is calculated as if it's a cylindrical capacitor, where the inner and outer radii are involved. But the problem doesn't describe that; it's about a half-cylinder with electrodes on the flat faces.

Wait, another thought: maybe the capacitor is formed between the two flat faces, with the dielectric being the BaTiO3 in between. So the area is 12 cm², the separation is the length of the cylinder, 3 cm. Then C = (5000 * 8.85e-12 * 12e-4) / 0.03.

Wait, let me compute that again.

5000 *8.85e-12 = 44,250e-12 = 4.425e-8 F/m.

Multiply by 12e-4 m²: 4.425e-8 * 12e-4 = 5.31e-11 F·m.

Divide by 0.03 m: 5.31e-11 /0.03 = 1.77e-9 F = 1770 nF. But the options are much lower, like 700e-12 is 0.7 nF, so 1770 is much bigger.

Hmm, this suggests I'm using the wrong model. Maybe the problem is that the capacitor isn't a parallel plate but something else, like a coaxial or cylindrical capacitor. Let's think about that.

Wait, wait, the original cylinder is a hollow BaTiO3 cylinder, and when cut in half, the half has inner radius a=1 cm, outer radius b=2 cm, length L=3 cm. The electrodes are on the two flat rectangular faces. So maybe the capacitance is calculated as the capacitance between the inner and outer surfaces of the half-cylinder. But that would be a cylindrical capacitor, where C = (2*pi*epsilon*epsilon_0 * L) / ln(b/a).

Wait, but in that case, the electrodes would be on the inner and outer curved surfaces, not the flat faces. But the problem says electrodes are on the flat rectangular faces. So perhaps that's not the case.

Alternatively, perhaps the flat faces are considered as the plates of a parallel plate capacitor, with the separation being the radial thickness of the cylinder's wall. So the separation d is (b - a) =1 cm. The area A is the area of the flat face, which is L * (2b) =3 cm *4 cm=12 cm².

So then C = (epsilon_R * epsilon_0 * A) / d.
