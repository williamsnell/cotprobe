Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says that there are two copper blocks, each with a mass of 10.0 kg. One is at 100 degrees Celsius, and the other is at 0 degrees Celsius. They're placed in contact in an isolated container, so no heat is exchanged with the surroundings. I'm supposed to calculate the change in enthalpy (ΔH) for this process. The specific heat capacity of copper is given as 0.385 J/(K·g), and we can assume it's constant over the temperature range involved.

Hmm, wait. The problem asks for ΔH, which is the enthalpy change. But wait, enthalpy is usually a function that applies at constant pressure. In this scenario, the system is isolated, so it's more of an adiabatic process, and I think the first law of thermodynamics would apply here, which is about internal energy change (ΔU) when there's no heat exchange. But why is the question asking for ΔH then? That's a bit confusing.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's think about what happens when the two blocks are placed in contact. The hotter block will lose heat, and the colder block will gain heat until they reach thermal equilibrium. The heat lost by the hot block should equal the heat gained by the cold block, assuming no heat is lost to the surroundings because the container is isolated.

Right, but wait, the system as a whole is isolated, so the total internal energy change (ΔU) of the combined system should be zero because no work is done and no heat is exchanged with the surroundings. So the heat lost by the hot block equals the heat gained by the cold block.

But the question is about ΔH, the change in enthalpy, not ΔU. Hmm. Enthalpy (H) is defined as H = U + PV. The change in enthalpy ΔH would be ΔU + Δ(PV). But in this case, since it's a solid (copper blocks), the volume change might be negligible, especially since copper is a solid and doesn't expand much with temperature. So maybe Δ(PV) is approximately zero. If that's the case, then ΔH ≈ ΔU. But wait, if the process occurs at constant pressure, then ΔH would be equal to the heat at constant pressure. But in this case, since the container is isolated, I'm not sure if the pressure is constant for each block.

Wait, maybe I should focus on the fact that the problem is asking for ΔH, but perhaps it's a trick question. Because for an isolated system where no work is done, the internal energy change is zero. But what about enthalpy? Because enthalpy is a state function, but it's not necessarily zero unless certain conditions apply.

Wait, no, wait. Because the system as a whole is isolated, the internal energy change of the system (both blocks together) is zero. So ΔU_total = 0. But ΔH is for the entire system as well. So let me think: H is a state function, and for the combined system, the initial and final states are different in terms of temperature, but what about the sum?

Wait, another approach. Enthalpy is H = U + PV. The change in H for the system (both blocks) would be ΔH = ΔU + Δ(PV). But since the system is isolated, ΔU for the system is zero. So ΔH = Δ(PV). If the volume doesn't change significantly, then PV is roughly constant, so ΔH would be zero.

Wait, but wait. The system is the two copper blocks. Copper is a solid, so its volume doesn't change much with temperature. So when the hot block cools down and the cold block warms up, the volume changes would be minimal. So the change in PV for each block would be negligible. Hence, ΔH would be approximately zero.

But wait, another angle. For an isolated system where no work is done and no heat is exchanged, the internal energy change is zero. But if we're calculating the enthalpy change of the whole system, then since H = U + PV, and U doesn't change (ΔU = 0), then ΔH would be Δ(PV). If the volume doesn't change, then PV doesn't change, so ΔH = 0.

So the answer would be zero, which is option J.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes people get confused between heat transfer at constant pressure (which is enthalpy) and other scenarios. But in this case, the system is isolated, so no heat is exchanged with the surroundings. But the question is about the change in enthalpy of the system as a whole.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating and the correct answer is zero. Because in an isolated system, the enthalpy change would be zero if no work is done and the volume is constant. But I'm not entirely sure, but I think that's the case here.

The problem involves two copper blocks, each of mass \(10.0 \, \mathrm{kg}\), one at \(100^\circ \mathrm{C}\) and the other at \(0^\circ \mathrm{C}\), placed in contact in an isolated container. The goal is to calculate the change in enthalpy (\(\Delta H\)) for this process. The specific heat capacity of copper is given as \(0.385 \, \mathrm{J} \, \mathrm{K}^{-1} \, \mathrm{g}^{-1}\), and it is assumed constant over the temperature range.

In an isolated system, no heat is exchanged with the surroundings, and the total internal energy (\(\Delta U\)) of the system remains constant. Enthalpy (\(H\)) is defined as \(H = U + PV\), where \(P\) is pressure and \(V\) is volume. For solids like copper, the volume change with temperature is negligible, meaning \(\Delta (PV)\) is approximately zero. Therefore, \(\Delta H \approx \Delta U\). Since the system is isolated and no work is done, \(\Delta U = 0\), which implies \(\Delta H = 0\).

Thus, the change in enthalpy for the system as a whole is zero. The correct answer is:

**J: 0**
