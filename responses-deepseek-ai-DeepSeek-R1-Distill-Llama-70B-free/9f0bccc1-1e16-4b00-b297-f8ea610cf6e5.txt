Question:

Ricardo's theory of distribution assumed that the supply of land was fixed, while the country's population and cap-ital stock were constantly increasing. On the basis of these assumptions, he predicted eventual stagnation of the economy. How would this happen according to Ricardo?

Options:

A: The increasing population results in a surplus of land.
B: Landlords decrease rent prices to encourage more farming, leading to an economic boom.
C: The increasing population leads to increased demand for land, which eventually leads to a decline in profits, resulting in economic stagnation and decline.
D: The fixed supply of land has no impact on the economy, as technological advancements ensure sustained productivity.
E: Capital stock diminishes over time, leading to a reduction in the workforce and a stagnant economy.
F: The constant increase in capital stock leads to a technological revolution that offsets any negative effects of a fixed supply of land.
G: Landlords invest their incomes leading to economic growth.
H: The fixed supply of land leads to increased innovation in agriculture, which results in perpetual economic expansion.
I: The fixed supply of land leads to a decrease in demand.
J: The increasing population leads to a decrease in wages, which in turn increases the overall savings and investment, resulting in economic growth.

Okay, so I've got this question about Ricardo's theory of distribution. Hmm, I remember that Ricardo was a classical economist. His theories probably relate to how income is distributed among different classes like landlords, workers, and capitalists.

The question says that Ricardo assumed the supply of land was fixed. So, land can't increase because it's fixed. But the population and capital stock are increasing. So population grows, more people, and more capital means more investment or machines or something.

Ricardo predicted eventual stagnation of the economy. Stagnation means the economy stops growing. So I need to figure out why that would happen based on his assumptions.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Increasing population causes a surplus of land. Wait, if land is fixed and population increases, wouldn't there be less land per person? So surplus doesn't make sense. Probably wrong.

Option B: Landlords decrease rent to encourage farming, leading to a boom. But if land is scarce, maybe rents go up, not down. Plus, Ricardo was talking about stagnation, not a boom. So B might not be right.

Option C: Increasing population leads to higher demand for land, which causes profits to decline, leading to stagnation. That sounds plausible. More people would need more food, so more demand for land. But since land is fixed, maybe the cost of producing food increases. Ricardo talked about diminishing returns in agriculture. As more labor and capital are applied to fixed land, each additional unit produces less. So profits for capitalists would fall because their costs (like wages and rents) go up. If profits decline, investment might decrease, leading to economic stagnation.

Option D: Fixed land doesn't impact the economy because tech advancements sustain productivity. I don't think Ricardo counted on continuous technological progress. Classical economists like him focused more on diminishing returns. So D might not be right.

Option E: Capital stock diminishes, reducing workforce. But the question says capital stock is increasing, so E contradicts the premise. So E is wrong.

Option F: Increasing capital leads to tech revolution offsetting fixed land. Again, I thought Ricardo didn't see tech as a savior here. His model was more about diminishing returns, so F might not be correct.

Option G: Landlords invest, leading to growth. Well, in Ricardo's model, landlords get rent, but if profits fall, maybe capitalists can't invest as much. So G might not explain stagnation.

Option H: Fixed land leads to innovation. I'm not sure. Maybe in the short term, but if Ricardo's model is about diminishing returns, innovation might not be enough to prevent stagnation. So H could be possible, but I'm not certain.

Option I: Fixed land decreases demand. I don't see how that directly leads to stagnation. Maybe less demand for goods? Not sure, but I think it's less likely.

Option J: Population increases lead to lower wages, which increase savings and investment. Wait, lower wages mean workers have less, but if savings increase, maybe more investment. Ricardo's model, I think, focused more on profits. If wages are forced down, maybe that affects demand for goods, but the main issue was about land and diminishing returns. So J might not be the right path.

Putting it all together, Ricardo's theory was about the diminishing returns from land. As population grows, more demand for food requires more intensive use of land. But since land is fixed, each additional unit of labor and capital adds less output. This would cause the marginal productivity to drop, leading to lower profits for capitalists. Lower profits mean less investment and hence economic stagnation.

So the correct option should be the one that talks about increasing demand for land leading to decline in profits and stagnation. Looking back, option C says exactly that. So the answer should be C.

Ricardo's theory of distribution, based on the assumptions of a fixed supply of land and increasing population and capital stock, predicts economic stagnation due to diminishing returns in agriculture. As the population grows, the demand for land increases to produce more food. However, since the supply of land is fixed, additional labor and capital applied to the land yield progressively smaller returns. This leads to rising costs and declining profits for capitalists. With profits falling, investment decreases, resulting in economic stagnation and decline.

Option C correctly captures this mechanism, explaining that the increasing population leads to higher demand for land, which eventually causes a decline in profits and stagnation. Other options either contradict Ricardo's assumptions (e.g., A, B, E, F) or misrepresent the underlying causes of stagnation (e.g., D, G, H, I, J).
