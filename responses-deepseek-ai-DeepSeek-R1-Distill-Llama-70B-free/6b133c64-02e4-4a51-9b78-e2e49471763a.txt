Okay, so I've got this problem about a stove purchase and figuring out the financing charge. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

Alright, the stove costs $250. Instead of paying it all at once, there's an installment plan. The plan says a $25 down payment and then 12 monthly payments of $20 each. I need to find out what the financing charge is.

Wait, what's a financing charge? I think that's the extra cost you pay for not paying the full amount upfront. So it's like the interest or fees added when you take the installment option.

First, let me figure out the total amount paid under the installment plan. There's a down payment and then the monthly payments. The down payment is $25. Then there are 12 payments of $20 each. So the total would be the down payment plus (number of payments multiplied by each payment).

Calculating that: 25 + (12 * 20). Let's see, 12 times 20 is 240. Adding the 25, that's 265. So total paid is $265.

But the stove's original price is $250. The financing charge would be the difference between what I paid in total and the original price. So that's 265 minus 250. That gives me 15. Wait, that's $15. So the financing charge is $15.

Wait wait, let me check again. Let's make sure I didn't make a mistake. The down payment is 25, and each month is 20 for 12 months. 12*20 is 240, plus 25 is 265. The price is 250, so 265-250=15. That seems right.

Looking at the options, I see option I is $15. So the answer must be I.

But wait, let me think again. Is there any other way the financing charge is calculated? Like maybe they charge interest each month or something. Oh, but the problem doesn't mention any interest rates or fees beyond the payments. So it's just the total amount paid minus the original price.

So yes, I think I'm correct. The financing charge is $15, which is option I.

The stove costs $250, and the installment plan requires a $25 down payment plus 12 monthly payments of $20 each. To calculate the total amount paid under the plan:

- Down payment: $25  
- Monthly payments: \( 12 \times 20 = 240 \)  
- Total paid: \( 25 + 240 = 265 \)

The financing charge is the difference between the total paid and the original price of the stove:  
\( 265 - 250 = 15 \).

Thus, the financing charge is $15, which corresponds to option I.
