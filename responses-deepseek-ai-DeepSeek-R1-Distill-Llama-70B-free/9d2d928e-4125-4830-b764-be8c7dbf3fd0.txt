Okay, so I've got this question here: "Who was on the $500 bill?" And there are options from A to J. I need to figure out which one is correct. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I know that the United States has had various denominations of currency over the years, but I'm more familiar with the ones in circulation today. I'm pretty sure that currently, the highest bill is $100, featuring Benjamin Franklin. But I've heard that in the past, there were larger denominations, like $500, $1000, etc. So the question is about a $500 bill, which I think is no longer printed anymore.

Now, I need to recall which historical figure was on the $500 bill. I remember that each bill usually features a prominent figure, often a president or a significant founding father. Let's go through the options one by one.

Option A is Calvin Coolidge. He was the 30th President, I think. I don't recall seeing his face on a $500 bill. Maybe he's on a different denomination? Not sure.

Option B is Abraham Lincoln. He's on the $5 bill and the penny. So definitely not the $500.

Option C is George Washington. He's on the $1 bill. So that's not it.

Option D is Benjamin Franklin. He's on the $100 bill. So again, not the $500.

Option E is Andrew Jackson. He used to be on the $20 bill, but I think they're changing that to Harriet Tubman. So he's not on the $500.

Option F is William McKinley. He was the 25th President, I believe. I'm not sure which bill he's on. Maybe a larger denomination? I'm not certain.

Option G is Thomas Jefferson. He's on the $2 bill, which is less common. So not the $500.

Option H is John Adams. I don't think he's on any of the current bills, but maybe he was on a larger one in the past.

Option I is Ulysses S. Grant. I remember that Grant is on the $50 bill. So that can't be right.

Option J is Aaron Burr. He was a Vice President, known for the duel with Alexander Hamilton. I don't think he's on any major currency.

Wait, I'm trying to remember. I think the $500 bill had William McKinley on it. McKinley was the 25th President, and I believe his portrait was used on the $500 bill, which was last printed in 1945 and was officially discontinued in 1969. So that would make option F the correct answer.

I'm a bit shaky on this, but putting it all together, I think it's William McKinley.
