Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about lenses, and I'm a bit nervous because optics can be a little tricky for me. But let's take it step by step.

Alright, the problem says that a point light source is on the axis of a convergent lens. Hmm, convergent lens, so that's a convex lens, right? Because convex lenses are converging. So the light source is on the axis, meaning it's along the principal axis of the lens. 

An image is formed 25 cm from the lens on the other side. So the image is real because it's formed on the opposite side of the object when using a convex lens. Wait, but wait, if the object is on the axis and the lens is convergent, then the image formation depends on where the object is placed relative to the focal point.

Wait, the object is at a point on the axis. Oh, but wait, the object distance is probably important here. Wait, the problem doesn't give the object distance directly. Hmm.

Then the second part: when a second lens is placed in contact with the first, the image is formed 40 cm from the combination on the side opposite the source. So the second lens is placed in contact, making it a compound lens system. The image is formed 40 cm from this combination, on the opposite side from the source. So the object is on one side, and the image is on the other side after the lenses.

The question is to find the focal length of the second lens.

Let me try to model this.

First, let's consider the first lens alone. The image is formed at 25 cm on the other side. So that's the image distance, v1. The object is a point source, so it's at some object distance u1 from the first lens. But wait, the object is on the axis, but is it at infinity? Or is it a finite distance?

Wait, the initial setup: the point source is on the axis, and the image is formed 25 cm away. So for a single convex lens, the image distance v1 is 25 cm. So using the lens formula: 1/f1 = 1/u1 + 1/v1.

But wait, u1 would be the object distance. If the object is a point source, that usually implies it's at a very large distance, but in this case, it's placed somewhere finite because the image is at 25 cm. Hmm, but maybe the object is at a specific position. Wait, actually, the problem doesn't specify whether the object is at a particular point, like between f and 2f or beyond 2f.

Wait, but maybe the initial setup is that the image is formed at 25 cm, so for the first lens, let's denote the object distance as u1, image distance as v1 = 25 cm. Since the lens is convergent (convex), and the image is real, the object must be beyond the focal length. Wait, but if u1 is greater than f1, then the image is between f1 and 2f1. Or wait, if u1 is greater than 2f1, the image is between f1 and 2f1. Wait, no, if the object is beyond 2f1, the image is between f1 and 2f1. If the object is between f1 and 2f1, the image is beyond 2f1. Hmm, but I'm getting a bit stuck here because I don't know the object distance.

Wait a minute, perhaps the object is at infinity. Because point sources are often considered at infinity, but in that case, the image would be formed at the focal point. But here, the image is at 25 cm, so f1 would be 25 cm. But wait, that would be if the object is at infinity. But the problem doesn't say that. So maybe the object is at a finite distance.

Wait, perhaps I need to proceed differently. Let's consider the first lens. Let me denote the focal length as f1. Then, using the lens formula: 1/f1 = 1/u1 + 1/v1. We know that v1 is positive because it's a real image on the opposite side. But without knowing u1, I can't find f1 directly. Hmm.

Ah, but when the second lens is placed in contact, the combination's focal length is different. Wait, but perhaps I can model the two-lens system and find the relations.

When two lenses are in contact, the equivalent focal length (f_eq) is given by 1/f_eq = 1/f1 + 1/f2.

Wait, but when the second lens is placed in contact, the image is formed 40 cm from the combination on the opposite side. So the image distance for the combination is v2 = 40 cm. Now, the object is the same point source, but since the lenses are in contact, the object distance for the combination would be u. Wait, no, the object is placed at some point in front of the first lens, so the object distance for the combination is the same as the object distance for the first lens, perhaps?

Wait, maybe I should model the system step by step. Let me think.

In the first case, with only the first lens:

Object is at u1, image is at v1 = 25 cm. So,

1/f1 = 1/u1 + 1/25. --- (1)

In the second case, when the second lens is placed in contact, the combination forms an image at v2 = 40 cm. So for the combination, the object is at u, and the image is at v2 = 40 cm. So using the lens formula for the combination:

1/f_eq = 1/u + 1/40. --- (2)

But f_eq is the equivalent focal length of the two lenses in contact, so 1/f_eq = 1/f1 + 1/f2. So,

1/f1 + 1/f2 = 1/u + 1/40. --- (3)

But I don't know u yet. Wait, but in equation (1), u1 is the object distance for the first lens alone. When the second lens is placed in contact, the object is at u1 from the first lens, but the second lens is right after the first, so the object distance for the second lens would be the image distance of the first lens. Wait, no, when two lenses are in contact, the image formed by the first lens becomes the object for the second lens. But wait, the object is placed at u1 from the first lens, and when the second lens is placed in contact, the object for the second lens would be the image formed by the first lens, which is at v1 = 25 cm behind the first lens.

Wait, so the object distance for the second lens would be the image distance from the first lens, which is 25 cm. But since the second lens is in contact, the object for the second lens would be at 25 cm from it. So the object distance for the second lens is u2 = -25 cm (negative because it's a real object on the same side as the lens, or is it? Wait, no. Wait, in lens formula, the object distance is positive if it's on the same side as the incoming light. So for the second lens, the object is the image from the first lens, which is on the opposite side. So u2 would be positive 25 cm.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again.

When two lenses are used together, the first lens forms an image which becomes the object for the second lens. The distance between the lenses is the sum of the image distance from the first and the object distance for the second. But when the lenses are in contact, the separation is zero, so the image distance from the first lens becomes the object distance for the second lens. But wait, the image from the first lens is formed at v1 = 25 cm. So the object for the second lens is at u2 = v1 = 25 cm. Wait, but if the image is on the opposite side, then for the second lens, the object is at u2 = 25 cm, but since it's a real image, the object distance for the second lens would be positive. So the second lens sees an object at 25 cm in front of it.

So applying the lens formula for the second lens: 1/f2 = 1/u2 + 1/v2', where v2' is the image distance for the second lens alone. But wait, no, because the two lenses are in contact, so the image formed by the second lens is the final image. So the image distance for the combination is 40 cm. Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the combined system.

Wait, but perhaps the key is to model the two cases: first, the single lens, then the combination.

Wait, let me think of the two-lens system. The object is at u, and the image is at v = 40 cm. But the equivalent focal length for the combination is f_eq = (f1 * f2)/(f1 + f2).

Wait, no, the formula for two lenses in contact is 1/f_eq = 1/f1 + 1/f2. So f_eq is the equivalent focal length.

So, for the combination, the lens formula is 1/f_eq = 1/u + 1/v. Here, v is 40 cm. But what is u? u is the object distance for the combination, which is the same as the object distance for the first lens in the original setup, which is u1. Because the object hasn't moved; it's just that now two lenses are in contact. So u is the same as u1.

But wait, do I know u1? No, because I only have v1 for the first case.

Wait, perhaps I can set up equations. From the first case, equation (1): 1/f1 = 1/u1 + 1/25.

From the second case, the combination equation:

1/f_eq = 1/u1 + 1/40.

But since f_eq is given by 1/f1 + 1/f2, substituting:

1/f1 + 1/f2 = 1/u1 + 1/40.

Now, from equation (1), I can express 1/u1 as (1/f1) - 1/25.

Substituting into the combination equation:

1/f1 + 1/f2 = (1/f1 - 1/25) + 1/40.

Wait, let's compute the right-hand side.

(1/f1 - 1/25) + 1/40 = 1/f1 - (1/25 - 1/40).

Wait, because 1/25 is positive, and subtracting 1/25, adding 1/40.

Wait, let me compute 1/25 - 1/40.

The common denominator is 200. So 8/200 - 5/200 = 3/200. So 1/25 - 1/40 = 3/200. Therefore,

1/f1 - (3/200) + 1/40?

Wait, no, no. Wait, the equation is:

1/f1 + 1/f2 = [1/f1 - 1/25] + 1/40.

Let me reorganize it:

1/f1 + 1/f2 = 1/f1 + (-1/25 + 1/40).

So the 1/f1 terms cancel out on both sides, leaving:

1/f2 = (-1/25 + 1/40).

Compute that:

-1/25 is -0.04, and 1/40 is 0.025. So -0.04 + 0.025 = -0.015.

So 1/f2 = -0.015.

Therefore, f2 = 1 / (-0.015) ≈ -66.666... cm.

So that's approximately -66.67 cm. Let me check the options. Option A is 66.67 cm, option I is -66.67 cm. So the answer would be I.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps because signs are tricky in optics.

Wait, in the combination case, the image is formed on the opposite side from the source, which is the same as before. So the image distance is positive 40 cm. The object distance for the combination is u1, which for the single lens case was u1. So when I substituted, I used u1 as the object distance for the combination, which is correct.

Wait, let's re-express the combination equation correctly. The combination's object is at u1, and image at 40 cm. So 1/f_eq = 1/u1 + 1/40.

But f_eq is 1/f1 + 1/f2, so:

1/f1 + 1/f2 = 1/u1 + 1/40.

From equation (1), 1/f1 = 1/u1 + 1/25.

Substituting 1/u1 from equation (1) into the combination equation:

1/f1 + 1/f2 = (1/f1 - 1/25) + 1/40.

Wait, that would give 1/f2 = (-1/25 + 1/40).

Calculating that: 1/40 is 0.025, 1/25 is 0.04. So 0.025 - 0.04 = -0.015. So 1/f2 = -0.015 → f2 = -66.666 cm.

So that's negative, which would mean it's a diverging lens. So option I: -66.67 cm.

Wait, but let me think again: when the second lens is placed in contact, the image moves further away. So the combination is making the image farther than the original 25 cm. So the combination must have a longer focal length than the original lens, or perhaps a negative focal length.

Wait, but the original focal length f1 can be found from equation (1). Because from the single lens case, I can write 1/f1 = 1/u1 + 1/25. But without knowing u1, perhaps I can't find f1, but in this problem, I don't need f1, only f2.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the signs. Let me re-express the equations.

In the single lens case:

Object distance u1 is positive because it's on the same side as the incoming light. Image distance v1 is positive because it's real and on the opposite side.

So equation (1): 1/f1 = 1/u1 + 1/25.

In the combination case:

The object is the same, at u1 (so positive), and image at v=40 cm (positive). So equation (2):

1/f_eq = 1/u1 + 1/40.

And f_eq is 1/f1 + 1/f2.

Substituting equation (1) into equation (2):

1/f1 + 1/f2 = (1/f1 - 1/25) + 1/40.

Wait, no, equation (1) rearranged is 1/u1 = 1/f1 - 1/25.

So substituting into equation (2):

1/f1 + 1/f2 = (1/f1 - 1/25) + 1/40.

So that gives:

1/f1 + 1/f2 = 1/f1 - (1/25 - 1/40).

Wait, 1/25 is 0.04, 1/40 is 0.025. So 1/25 - 1/40 is 0.015. So:

1/f1 + 1/f2 = 1/f1 - 0.015.

Subtracting 1/f1 from both sides:

1/f2 = -0.015 → f2 = -66.666... cm.

Yes, that seems right. So the second lens must be diverging, with f = -66.67 cm. So option I.
</think>

To solve the problem, we analyze the two cases: the single lens and the lens combination.

### Case 1: Single Lens
The first lens is a convergent (convex) lens. The image is formed at a distance \( v_1 = 25 \, \text{cm} \) on the opposite side of the lens. Using the lens formula:

\[
\frac{1}{f_1} = \frac{1}{u_1} + \frac{1}{v_1},
\]

where \( u_1 \) is the object distance and \( f_1 \) is the focal length of the first lens. Since the object distance \( u_1 \) is not directly provided, we proceed to the second case.

### Case 2: Lens Combination
When a second lens is placed in contact with the first, the image is formed at \( v_2 = 40 \, \text{cm} \) on the opposite side of the combination. For the lens combination, the equivalent focal length \( f_{\text{eq}} \) is given by:

\[
\frac{1}{f_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{1}{f_1} + \frac{1}{f_2},
\]

where \( f_2 \) is the focal length of the second lens. Using the lens formula for the combination:

\[
\frac{1}{f_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{1}{u_1} + \frac{1}{v_2}.
\]

Substituting \( f_{\text{eq}} \) into the equation:

\[
\frac{1}{f_1} + \frac{1}{f_2} = \frac{1}{u_1} + \frac{1}{40}.
\]

From Case 1, we know:

\[
\frac{1}{f_1} = \frac{1}{u_1} + \frac{1}{25}.
\]

Rearranging for \( \frac{1}{u_1} \):

\[
\frac{1}{u_1} = \frac{1}{f_1} - \frac{1}{25}.
\]

Substituting \( \frac{1}{u_1} \) into the combination equation:

\[
\frac{1}{f_1} + \frac{1}{f_2} = \left( \frac{1}{f_1} - \frac{1}{25} \right) + \frac{1}{40}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\frac{1}{f_2} = -\frac{1}{25} + \frac{1}{40}.
\]

Calculating the right-hand side:

\[
-\frac{1}{25} + \frac{1}{40} = -\frac{8}{200} + \frac{5}{200} = -\frac{3}{200}.
\]

Thus:

\[
\frac{1}{f_2} = -\
