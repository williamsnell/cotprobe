Okay, I need to find the convolution of two functions f1(t) and f2(t). Both are given in time domain, so I'll have to remember how convolution works. Convolution is denoted by the asterisk symbol *, and the result is another function which is the integral of the product of one function and the time-reversed, shifted version of the other.

The functions are f1(t) = 2e^(-4t) u(t) and f2(t) = 5 cos(3t) u(t). Both are zero for t < 0 because of the unit step function u(t).

Convolution formula is (f1 * f2)(t) = integral from -infinity to infinity of f1(τ) f2(t-τ) dτ. But since both functions are zero for τ < 0 and t-τ < 0, the integral limits change. For τ, it goes from 0 to t. Because for τ beyond t, t-τ becomes negative, and f2 becomes zero.

So the integral becomes ∫ from 0 to t of f1(τ) f2(t-τ) dτ.

Substituting the given functions into the convolution integral:

f1(τ) = 2e^(-4τ) u(τ) → but since τ is from 0 to t, u(τ) is 1, so f1(τ) = 2e^(-4τ).

f2(t-τ) =5 cos[3(t-τ)] u(t-τ). But since τ is between 0 and t, t-τ is positive, so u(t-τ) is 1. So f2(t-τ) =5 cos(3t -3τ).

Putting it all together, the integral becomes 2 *5 ∫ from 0 to t e^(-4τ) cos(3t -3τ) dτ.

Wait, 2*5 is 10, so 10∫ e^(-4τ) cos(3(t-τ)) dτ from 0 to t.

Hmm, perhaps I can make a substitution to simplify this. Let me let θ = t-τ. But I'm not sure if that's the best approach. Alternatively, I can express the cosine term using the cosine of difference identity.

Wait, cos(A - B) = cos A cos B + sin A sin B. So cos(3t - 3τ) = cos(3t) cos(3τ) + sin(3t) sin(3τ).

So substituting that back in, the integral becomes:

10 [ cos(3t) ∫ e^(-4τ) cos(3τ) dτ from 0 to t + sin(3t) ∫ e^(-4τ) sin(3τ) dτ from 0 to t ]

So now I have to compute two integrals: ∫ e^(-4τ) cos(3τ) dτ and ∫ e^(-4τ) sin(3τ) dτ, each from 0 to t.

I remember that the integral of e^(at) cos(bt) dt is e^(at) [ a cos(bt) + b sin(bt) ] / (a² + b²) + C. Similarly for the sine integral, it's e^(at) [ a sin(bt) - b cos(bt) ] / (a² + b²) + C.

Wait, let me make sure I get the signs right. Let me rederive it quickly. Let’s consider I = ∫ e^{aτ} cos(bτ) dτ.

Integration by parts: Let u = e^{aτ}, dv = cos(bτ) dτ.
Then du = a e^{aτ} dτ, v = (1/b) sin(bτ).

So I = u v - ∫ v du = e^{aτ} (1/b) sin(bτ) - (a/b) ∫ e^{aτ} sin(bτ) dτ.

Now let’s compute the remaining integral: ∫ e^{aτ} sin(bτ) dτ.

Again, let u = e^{aτ}, dv = sin(bτ) dτ. Then du = a e^{aτ} dτ, v = (-1/b) cos(bτ).

So this integral becomes -e^{aτ} (1/b) cos(bτ) + (a/b) ∫ e^{aτ} cos(bτ) dτ.

Putting it back into the expression for I:

I = (e^{aτ} sin(bτ))/b - (a/b) [ -e^{aτ} cos(bτ)/(b) + (a/b) I ]

Simplify:

I = [e^{aτ} sin(bτ)]/b + (a e^{aτ} cos(bτ))/b² - (a²)/(b²) I.

Bring the (a²/b²) I term to the left:

I + (a²/b²) I = [e^{aτ} sin(bτ)]/b + (a e^{aτ} cos(bτ))/b².

Factor I:

I (1 + a²/b²) ) = e^{aτ} [ sin(bτ)/b + a cos(bτ)/b² ].

Multiply both sides by (1 + a²/b²) inverse:

I = e^{aτ} [ sin(bτ)/b + (a cos(bτ))/b² ] / (1 + a²/b² )

Multiply numerator and denominator by b²:

I = e^{aτ} [ b sin(bτ) + a cos(bτ) ] / (b² + a² )

So for our case, the integral ∫ e^{-4τ} cos(3τ) dτ would have a = -4 and b=3.

So I1 = ∫ e^{-4τ} cos(3τ) dτ from 0 to t.

Wait, but in our case, the integral is from 0 to t, so evaluating from 0 to t:

I1 = [ e^{-4t} (3 sin(3t) + (-4) cos(3t)) ) / ( (3)^2 + (-4)^2 ) ) ] - [ e^{0} (3 sin(0) + (-4) cos(0) ) / (9 +16) ) ]

Simplify denominator 25.

So I1 = [ e^{-4t} (3 sin3t -4 cos3t) /25 ] - [ (0 + (-4)(1) ) /25 ]

I1 = [e^{-4t} (3 sin3t -4 cos3t) - (-4) ] /25

Wait, let me compute the second term when τ=0:

At τ=0, the expression inside the brackets is [0 + (-4)*1] = -4.

So the entire expression at τ=0 is (-4)/25.

So when we subtract, it becomes [ (expression at t) ] - [ (-4/25) ].

Wait, the integral from 0 to t is [F(t) - F(0)].

So F(t) is [e^{-4t} (3 sin3t -4 cos3t)] /25.

F(0) is [e^0 (0 -4 *1)] /25 = (-4)/25.

So I1 = [e^{-4t} (3 sin3t -4 cos3t) - (-4)] /25

Wait no: F(t) = [e^{-4t} (3 sin3t -4 cos3t)] /25

So I1 = F(t) - F(0) = [e^{-4t}(3 sin3t -4 cos3t)/25] - [ (-4)/25 ]

= [e^{-4t}(3 sin3t -4 cos3t) +4 ] /25

Similarly, let's calculate I2 = ∫ e^{-4τ} sin(3τ) dτ from 0 to t.

Using the same method. For ∫ e^{aτ} sin(bτ) dτ, the formula I think is:

I = e^{aτ} [ a sin(bτ) - b cos(bτ) ] / (a² + b² )

Wait, let me double-check. Let's rederive it.

Let’s compute I = ∫ e^{aτ} sin(bτ) dτ.

Let u = e^{aτ}, dv = sin(bτ) dτ.

Then du = a e^{aτ} dτ, v = (-1/b) cos(bτ).

So I = -e^{aτ} cos(bτ)/(b) + (a/b) ∫ e^{aτ} cos(bτ) dτ.

We already have the integral of e^{aτ} cos(bτ) dτ as (e^{aτ} [a cos(bτ) + b sin(bτ) ]) / (a² + b²).

So substituting back:

I = -e^{aτ} cos(bτ)/(b) + (a/b) * [ e^{aτ} (a cos(bτ) + b sin(bτ)) / (a² + b²) ) ]

Simplify:

I = -e^{aτ} cos(bτ)/b + (a e^{aτ} (a cos(bτ) + b sin(bτ)) ) / [ b (a² + b²) ) ]

Factor e^{aτ}:

I = e^{aτ} [ -cos(bτ)/b + (a (a cos(bτ) + b sin(bτ)) ) / (b (a² + b²)) ) ]

Combine terms:

Let me get a common denominator. Let me write the first term as (- (a² + b²) cos(bτ) ) / [ b (a² + b²) ) ]

So:

I = e^{aτ} [ ( - (a² + b²) cos(bτ) + a² cos(bτ) + a b sin(bτ) ) ) / ( b (a² + b²) ) ) ]

Simplify numerator:

- (a² + b²) cos(bτ) + a² cos(bτ) = -b² cos(bτ)

So numerator becomes ( -b² cos(bτ) + a b sin(bτ) ) )

Factor out b:

= b ( -b cos(bτ) + a sin(bτ) )

So I = e^{aτ} * [ b ( -b cos(bτ) + a sin(bτ) ) ) ] / [ b (a² + b²) ) ]

Cancel b:

I = e^{aτ} ( -b cos(bτ) + a sin(bτ) ) ) / (a² + b² )

So for our case, a = -4 and b=3.

So I2 = ∫ e^{-4τ} sin(3τ) dτ from 0 to t.

The integral is [ e^{-4τ} ( -3 cos(3τ) + (-4) sin(3τ) ) ) ] / ( (-4)^2 + 3^2 ) evaluated from 0 to t.

Denominator is 16 +9=25.

So I2 = [ e^{-4τ} ( -3 cos3τ -4 sin3τ ) /25 ] evaluated from 0 to t.

At τ = t: [ e^{-4t} ( -3 cos3t -4 sin3t ) /25 ]

At τ=0: [ e^0 ( -3 cos0 -4 sin0 ) /25 ] = [ 1*( -3*1 -0 ) ] /25 = (-3)/25

So I2 = [ e^{-4t} (-3 cos3t -4 sin3t) ]/25 - [ (-3/25) ]

= [ e^{-4t} (-3 cos3t -4 sin3t) +3 ] /25

Now, going back to the original convolution integral.

We have:

convolution = 10 [ cos(3t) * I1 + sin(3t) * I2 ]

Wait, no, wait. Wait the convolution was:

10 [ cos(3t) ∫ e^{-4τ} cos(3τ) dτ + sin(3t) ∫ e^{-4τ} sin(3τ) dτ ]

Which is 10 [ cos(3t) * I1 + sin(3t) * I2 ]

Substituting I1 and I2:

I1 = [e^{-4t}(3 sin3t -4 cos3t) +4 ] /25

I2 = [e^{-4t}(-3 cos3t -4 sin3t) +3 ] /25

So:

cos(3t) * I1 = cos(3t) * [ e^{-4t} (3 sin3t -4 cos3t ) +4 ] /25

Similarly, sin(3t) * I2 = sin(3t) * [ e^{-4t} ( -3 cos3t -4 sin3t ) +3 ] /25

Let me compute each term.

First term: cos(3t) * I1:

= [ cos3t ( e^{-4t} (3 sin3t -4 cos3t ) ) + 4 cos3t ] /25

= [ e^{-4t} (3 sin3t cos3t -4 cos^2 3t ) +4 cos3t ] /25

Second term: sin(3t) * I2:

= [ sin3t ( e^{-4t} ( -3 cos3t -4 sin3t ) ) +3 sin3t ] /25

= [ e^{-4t} ( -3 sin3t cos3t -4 sin^2 3t ) +3 sin3t ] /25

Now, adding these two terms together:

[First term] + [Second term] = 

[ e^{-4t} (3 sin3t cos3t -4 cos^2 3t ) +4 cos3t + e^{-4t} (-3 sin3t cos3t -4 sin^2 3t ) +3 sin3t ] all over 25.

Let me compute the numerator:

The e^{-4t} terms:

3 sin3t cos3t -4 cos^2 3t -3 sin3t cos3t -4 sin^2 3t

The 3 sin3t cos3t and -3 sin3t cos3t cancel each other out.

So remaining: -4 cos^2 3t -4 sin^2 3t = -4 (cos^2 3t + sin^2 3t ) = -4 (1) = -4.

So the e^{-4t} terms sum to -4 e^{-4t}.

The non-e terms:

4 cos3t +3 sin3t.

So overall:

[ -4 e^{-4t} +4 cos3t +3 sin3t ] /25

Multiply this by 10 (from the convolution's factor of 10 outside the integral):

10 * [ (-4 e^{-4t} +4 cos3t +3 sin3t ) /25 ] 

Simplify 10/25 = 2/5 = 0.4.

So 10 * numerator /25 = ( -4 e^{-4t} +4 cos3t +3 sin3t ) * (2/5 )

Which is:

( (4 cos3t +3 sin3t -4 e^{-4t} )) * 2/5 )

Wait wait, let me compute that:

Wait: 10 * [ (-4 e^{-4t} +4 cos3t +3 sin3t ) ] /25

= (10 * (-4 e^{-4t} ) ) /25 + (10 *4 cos3t )/25 + (10*3 sin3t)/25

= (-40 e^{-4t} ) /25 + (40 cos3t)/25 + (30 sin3t)/25

Simplify each term:

-40/25 = -8/5 = -1.6

40/25 = 8/5 = 1.6

30/25 = 6/5 = 1.2

So the expression becomes:

-1.6 e^{-4t} +1.6 cos3t +1.2 sin3t

So putting it all together, the convolution result is:

[1.6 cos3t + 1.2 sin3t -1.6 e^{-4t} ] u(t)

Because the original functions are multiplied by u(t), so the convolution will also have a u(t) multiplied because the integral from 0 to t would ensure that for t <0, the result is zero.

Looking at the options, option D is (1.6 cos3t +1.0 sin3t -1.6 e^{-4t}) u(t). No, that's not matching. Wait, wait the option A is (1.6 cos3t +1.2 sin3t -1.6 e^{-4t}) u(t). Yes, that matches.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option A says 1.6 cos3t +1.2 sin3t -1.6e^{-4t}.

Yes, that's what I have. So the correct answer should be option A.

To find the convolution \( f_1(t) * f_2(t) \), we start with the given functions:

\[
f_1(t) = 2e^{-4t}u(t), \quad f_2(t) = 5\cos(3t)u(t).
\]

The convolution formula is:

\[
(f_1 * f_2)(t) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty f_1(\tau)f_2(t-\tau)d\tau.
\]

Since both functions are causal (zero for \( t < 0 \)), the integral simplifies to:

\[
(f_1 * f_2)(t) = \int_0^t f_1(\tau)f_2(t-\tau)d\tau.
\]

Substituting \( f_1(\tau) = 2e^{-4\tau} \) and \( f_2(t-\tau) = 5\cos(3(t-\tau)) \), we have:

\[
(f_1 * f_2)(t) = 10 \int_0^t e^{-4\tau} \cos(3t - 3\tau)d\tau.
\]

Using the trigonometric identity \( \cos(A-B) = \cos A \cos B + \sin A \sin B \), we expand \( \cos(3t - 3\tau) \):

\[
\cos(3t - 3\tau) = \cos(3t)\cos(3\tau) + \sin(3t)\sin(3\tau).
\]

Substituting this into the integral:

\
