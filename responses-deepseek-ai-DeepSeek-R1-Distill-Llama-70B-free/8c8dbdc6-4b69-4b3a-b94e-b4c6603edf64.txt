Okay, so I've got this question about afterimages, and I need to figure it out. Let me think. I remember that afterimages have something to do with how our eyes work, specifically the retina and the cones. When you stare at a color for a while, the cones get fatigued, right?

So, the question says Curtis is staring at a yellow star for a full minute. Then he looks at a white paper. The afterimage he sees will be some color. I think afterimages are in complementary colors. Wait, what's complementary again? Oh right, the color opposite on the color wheel. So yellow's complement is... purple? Because I remember red and green are complements, blue and orange, and yellow and purple.

Wait, no, wait. Another way to think about it is in terms of the RGB color model. Yellow is made up of red and green light. When those cones get tired, the brain doesn't perceive red and green as strongly. So when he looks at white, which has all colors, the red and green parts are not perceived, leaving blue? Hmm, no that doesn't sound right. Or maybe I'm mixing something up.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try again. The cones in the retina are responsible for color vision. There are three types: sensitive to red, green, and blue light. When you stare at a yellow color, which is a combination of red and green light, the red and green cones get fatigued. So when you look at a white background, which has all wavelengths, the red and green cones can't respond as much, so the blue cones are working normally. But the afterimage color is the complement, which would be blue? Wait no, wait. Wait, the afterimage is the color that's opposite to what you were looking at. So if you looked at yellow, the afterimage should be blue or purple.

Wait, I'm getting myself mixed up. Let me think about real-life examples. When I look at a bright red color for a while and then look at white, I see green. Because red and green are complementary. So if I look at yellow, which is red + green, would the afterimage be... the opposite of yellow. So the complement of yellow is blue. Because if you mix red, green, and blue, the opposite would be... Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the color wheel. On the color wheel, yellow is opposite to purple, right? So the afterimage should be purple.

Wait, that makes sense. Because when the red and green cones are tired, the blue cones are fresh, so when white light comes in, the red and green don't fire as much. So the brain perceives the opposite, which is blue's complement? No, I'm getting this tangled.

Alternatively, I've heard that when you look at a color, the afterimage is the complementary color. So yellow's complement is purple. So the afterimage is purple. So the answer would be F: purple.

Wait, but wait another moment. Some sources say that afterimages can vary, but the general rule is that the afterimage is the complement. So if the original is yellow, the afterimage is purple. So the answer is F.

But wait, sometimes I've heard that if you look at yellow, the afterimage is blue. Because yellow is red plus green, and their absence would leave blue. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing additive and subtractive color models here.

Wait, in the additive model (like RGB), yellow is red + green. If those cones are fatigued, the remaining blue would be more active, so the afterimage might be blue. But in the subtractive model (like paint), it's different. But the eyes work on the additive model because it's about light.

So when you stare at yellow (red + green), the red and green cones get tired. So when you look at white (which is all colors), the red and green parts are less active, so the blue is perceived more. Wait, but that would mean the afterimage is blue. But earlier thought said the complement is purple.

Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me look up the color wheel. On the color wheel, the primary colors are red, yellow, blue. The secondary colors are green (blue+yellow), orange (red+yellow), and purple (red+blue). So the complementary of yellow is purple. So the afterimage should be purple. Because the color wheel shows that.

So I'm getting conflicting possibilities here. On one hand, the red and green cones are tired, so the afterimage should be blue. But the color wheel suggests the complement is purple.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing additive and subtractive. Let me think: in terms of light, the primary colors are red, green, blue. So when you have a yellow light (which is red + green), the red and green cones are active. After staring, those cones are fatigued, so when you look at white (all colors), the red and green light don't stimulate those cones as much. The blue light is unaffected, so the afterimage would appear as blue. Because the brain is expecting the red and green, but not getting the signals, so it perceives the absence as blue. Or perhaps it's the opposite.

Wait, no, I'm getting this wrong. The afterimage is the color that, when added to the original, gives white. So if you have yellow (red + green), the afterimage would be blue, because red + green + blue = white. So the afterimage is blue.

Wait, but wait. I'm getting conflicting information. I've heard before that the afterimage is the complementary color on the color wheel. So that would make it purple for yellow. But according to the cone fatigue, it's blue.

Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to remember. The classic example is looking at red and seeing green, which is the complement. Because red and green are opposite on the color wheel. So maybe that's the case. So yellow's opposite is purple, so the afterimage is purple.

So the answer should be F: purple.

When Curtis stares at a yellow star for a full minute, the red and green cones in his retina, which are responsible for perceiving yellow light (a combination of red and green), become fatigued. When he then looks at a blank white piece of paper, the red and green cones are less responsive, while the blue cones remain unaffected. This imbalance in cone activity creates the perception of an afterimage.

The afterimage typically appears as the complementary color of the original stimulus. On the color wheel, yellow and purple are complementary, meaning they are directly opposite each other. Therefore, the afterimage Curtis sees will be purple.

The answer is F: purple.
