Question:

The average concentration of particulate lead in a city with highly polluted air is 5\mug/m^3. If an adult respires 8500 liters of air daily and if 50 per cent of the particles below 1\mumin size are retained in the lungs, calculate how much lead is absorbed in the lungs each day. Of the particu-late lead in urban air, 75 per cent is less than 1\mumin size.

Options:

A: 6.4 μg
B: 25.0 μg
C: 30.0 μg
D: 8.5\mug
E: 10.6 μg
F: 21.3 μg
G: 42.5\mug
H: 15.9\mug
I: 37.5\mug
J: 12.7 μg

Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the amount of lead absorbed in the lungs each day. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step. 

First, the problem states that the average concentration of particulate lead in the city is 5 micrograms per cubic meter. I remember that they probably expect me to convert that into something else or use it directly in the calculations. 

Next, it says an adult respires 8500 liters of air daily. Oh wait, I should probably convert liters to cubic meters because the concentration is given in micrograms per cubic meter. I think 1 cubic meter is 1000 liters, right? So 8500 liters would be 8.5 cubic meters because 8500 divided by 1000 is 8.5. Yeah, that makes sense.

Now, of the particulate lead, 75% is less than 1 micrometer in size. So the concentration of these fine particles must be a portion of the total. Let me calculate that. 75% of 5 micrograms/m³ is 0.75 * 5, which equals 3.75 micrograms per cubic meter. So that's the concentration of the particles that can actually be inhaled deep into the lungs.

Wait, but then it says that 50% of these particles below 1 micrometer are retained in the lungs. So I need to calculate how much of that 3.75 micrograms is actually retained. So that's 50% of 3.75, which is 1.875 micrograms per cubic meter. 

Now, to find the total amount absorbed each day, I need to multiply this concentration by the volume of air inhaled. Oh wait, but I already converted the 8500 liters to 8.5 cubic meters. So the calculation would be 1.875 μg/m³ multiplied by 8.5 m³. Let's do that math. 

1.875 times 8 is 15, and 1.875 times 0.5 is 0.9375. Adding those together gives me 15.9375 micrograms. Hmm, but let me check that multiplication again. 1.875 * 8.5. Wait, 8.5 is the same as 8 + 0.5. So 1.875 *8 = 15 and 1.875 *0.5 = 0.9375. So adding them gives 15.9375 μg. 

Wait a second, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Because 1.875 is 3/1.6 approximately, but maybe I'll just do it step by step. 8.5 times 1.875: 8 times 1 is 8, 8 times 0.875 is 7, so 8*1.875 is 15. Then 0.5 times 1.875 is 0.9375. So 15 +0.9375 is 15.9375. So about 15.9375 micrograms. 

Looking at the options, option H is 15.9 μg. That's really close to my calculation. But wait, let me see if I missed anything. Oh wait, the options are:

A:6.4, B:25, C:30, D:8.5, E:10.6, F:21.3, G:42.5, H:15.9, I:37.5, J:12.7.

So option H is 15.9 which matches my calculation. But wait, let me double-check all the steps because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake.

Starting again:

Total concentration = 5 μg/m³.

75% is <1 μm, so 5 * 0.75 = 3.75 μg/m³.

Of that, 50% is retained, so 3.75 *0.5 =1.875 μg/m³.

Volume inhaled is 8500 L =8.5 m³.

Total absorbed =1.875 *8.5 =15.9375 μg, which rounds to 15.9 μg. So yeah, that's correct. So the answer should be H.

To calculate the amount of lead absorbed in the lungs each day, we start with the given data:

1. **Concentration of particulate lead in the air**: \( 5 \, \mu\text{g/m}^3 \).
2. **Daily respiration volume**: \( 8500 \, \text{L} \), which is equivalent to \( 8.5 \, \text{m}^3 \) (since \( 1 \, \text{m}^3 = 1000 \, \text{L} \)).
3. **Fraction of particles smaller than \( 1 \, \mu\text{m} \)**: \( 75\% \), so the concentration of these particles is:
   \[
   5 \, \mu\text{g/m}^3 \times 0.75 = 3.75 \, \mu\text{g/m}^3.
   \]
4. **Fraction of particles retained in the lungs**: \( 50\% \), so the concentration of particles retained is:
   \[
   3.75 \, \mu\text{g/m}^3 \times 0.5 = 1.875 \, \mu\text{g/m}^3.
   \]
5. **Total lead absorbed daily**: Multiply the retained concentration by the volume of air inhaled:
   \[
   1.875 \, \mu\text{g/m}^3 \times 8.5 \, \text{m}^3 = 15.9375 \, \mu\text{g}.
   \]

The closest option to \( 15.9375 \, \mu\text{g} \) is **15.9 μg**, which corresponds to **Option H**.
