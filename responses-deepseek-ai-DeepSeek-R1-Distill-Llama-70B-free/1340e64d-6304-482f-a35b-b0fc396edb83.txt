Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Within a few weeks of treatment with the drug 3TC, a patient's HIV population consists entirely of 3TC-resistant viruses. How can this result best be explained?

Options:

A: The patient was initially infected with a 3TC-resistant strain of the virus.
B: The patient's immune system developed a resistance to 3TC, causing the drug to become ineffective.
C: The 3TC drug triggered a mutation in the HIV virus, causing it to become resistant.
D: The patient's body started producing 3TC-resistant viruses in response to the drug treatment.
E: A few drug-resistant viruses were present at the start of treatment, and natural selection increased their frequency.
F: The HIV virus can naturally resist any form of drug treatment.
G: The patient must have become reinfected with 3TC-resistant viruses.
H: HIV began making drug-resistant versions of reverse transcriptase in response to the drug.
I: The 3TC drug led to an increase in the production of HIV viruses.
J: HIV can change its surface proteins and resist vaccines.

Alright, so I've got this question about HIV and drug resistance, specifically with the drug 3TC. Hmm, okay, let's break it down. I remember that HIV is a virus that attacks the immune system, and antiretroviral drugs like 3TC are used to treat it. But sometimes, the virus becomes resistant to the drug, which is what's happening here. The question says that within a few weeks, all the HIV in the patient are resistant to 3TC. I need to figure out why that happened.

So the options are A through J. Let's go through them.

Option A: The patient was initially infected with a 3TC-resistant strain. Wait, but the question implies that the resistance developed after treatment started, not that the initial infection was resistant. So maybe not A.

Option B: The patient's immune system developed resistance. Wait, no. The immune system doesn't become resistant to drugs; it's the virus that does. So B doesn't make sense.

Option C: 3TC triggered a mutation making HIV resistant. I thought that mutations in viruses are random and occur naturally. The drug doesn't cause the mutation but selects for existing ones. So maybe C isn't right.

Option D: Patient's body started producing resistant viruses. No, the body doesn't produce the virus; the virus replicates on its own. So D is incorrect.

Option E: A few resistant viruses were present, and selection increased their frequency. Oh right, I remember something about this. HIV has a high mutation rate, so there are many variants. When you start treatment, the drug kills the susceptible ones, but any that are resistant (even if rare) survive and multiply. So E sounds plausible.

Option F: HIV can naturally resist any drug. That's not correct because not all drugs are ineffective; it's just that resistance can develop over time. So F is wrong.

Option G: Patient got reinfected with resistant viruses. The question doesn't mention anything about reinfection, so G is probably not the right answer.

Option H: HIV makes resistant reverse transcriptase in response to the drug. Hmm, that sounds a bit off. It's not a response but rather selection for pre-existing mutations. Plus, reverse transcriptase is the target, so mutations there would confer resistance, but the drug doesn't cause the mutations. So H might not be correct.

Option I: 3TC increases HIV production. I don't think so. Antiretroviral drugs are supposed to reduce viral load, not increase it. So I is probably wrong.

Option J: HIV changes surface proteins to resist vaccines. That's about vaccines, not drug treatment. Plus, surface proteins are more relevant for things like antibodies, not necessarily reverse transcriptase inhibitors like 3TC. So J isn't the right answer.

So putting it all together, the best explanation is that a few resistant viruses were present at the start. When the drug is administered, it kills the non-resistant ones, and the resistant ones replicate more, making the population entirely resistant over time. That's natural selection in action. So the correct answer should be E.

The best explanation is that a few drug-resistant viruses were present at the start of treatment, and natural selection increased their frequency as the drug killed the susceptible viruses, allowing the resistant ones to dominate.

Answer: E
