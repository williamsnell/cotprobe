Question:

When the population of a country consumes 90% of its income, and its technology is such that, at the margin, a $100 billion increase in its capital stock increases its output by $25 billion, what would you expect the growth rate of this society to be?

A: 4% per year
B: 7% per year
C: 5% per year
D: 1% per year
E: 3% per year
F: 0.5% per year

Okay, so I've got this economics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about the growth rate of a country's economy based on some given parameters.

So, the setup is that the population consumes 90% of its income. Hmm, right, consumption as a percentage of income. That leaves 10% for savings, I guess. Because if you consume 90%, you save 10% of your income.

Then, the technology part: for every $100 billion increase in capital stock, output increases by $25 billion. Wait, so the marginal product of capital is $25 billion per $100 billion. So that's like a 25% return on capital, right? Because 25/100 is 0.25, which is 25%.

Now, the question is about the growth rate. I'm trying to remember which model this relates to. Oh wait, this sounds like the Solow growth model. In the Solow model, the growth rate is determined by factors like savings rate, depreciation, population growth, and technological progress.

Wait, but in this question, I don't see any mention of population growth or technological progress. So maybe we're assuming those are zero or not relevant here. Or perhaps it's a simplified version.

In the Solow model, the steady-state growth rate is driven by the rate of technological progress and population growth. But if those are zero, then the growth rate would be zero in the long run. However, this question is probably referring to the growth rate during the transition towards the steady state.

Wait, no, maybe it's about the golden rule savings rate or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's using the Harrod-Domar model. Let me think.

The Harrod-Dor model says that the growth rate is equal to the savings rate divided by the capital-output ratio. Oh wait! Because in Harrod-Domar, g = s/(v), where s is the savings rate and v is the capital-output ratio.

So in this case, s is 10% because they consume 90%, so they save 10% of income. So s = 0.1.

Then, the capital-output ratio is the inverse of the marginal product of capital. Because, the marginal product of capital is the additional output per unit of capital. So if $100 billion in capital gives $25 billion in output, then each dollar of capital gives $0.25 output. So the marginal product of capital is 0.25.

Wait, but wait. The capital-output ratio (v) is capital divided by output. So if for every $100 billion of capital, output is $25 billion, then the capital-output ratio is 100/25 = 4. So v = 4.

Wait, let's double-check that. The marginal product of capital is dY/dK = 25/100 = 0.25. So the inverse of that is 1/0.25 = 4. So yes, capital-output ratio is 4.

So putting it into the Harrod-Domar formula, g = s / v = 0.1 / 4 = 0.025, which is 2.5% per year.

Looking at the options, option G is 2.5% per year. So that would be the answer.

But wait, am I confusing models here? Because in Solow, the growth rate in steady state is from technological progress. But if we're not considering that, perhaps for the transition phase, the growth rate is determined by the rate of capital accumulation.

Alternatively, maybe the question is using the idea of the "warranted growth rate" from Harrod-Domar, which is when the actual growth rate equals the warranted rate, which is g = s/(v). So that's why I think the answer is G, 2.5%.

The question involves determining the growth rate of a society based on its consumption and savings behavior, as well as its production technology. The population consumes 90% of its income, implying a savings rate \( s = 0.1 \). Additionally, the marginal product of capital is given as $25 billion of output per $100 billion increase in capital stock, which translates to a capital-output ratio \( v = \frac{100}{25} = 4 \).

Using the Harrod-Domar model, the growth rate \( g \) is calculated as:

\[
g = \frac{s}{v} = \frac{0.1}{4} = 0.025 \, \text{or} \, 2.5\% \, \text{per year}.
\]

Thus, the expected growth rate of this society is **2.5% per year**, corresponding to option G.
