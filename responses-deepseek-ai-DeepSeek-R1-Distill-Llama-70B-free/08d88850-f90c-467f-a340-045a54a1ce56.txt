Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I'm supposed to find the greatest odd integer that's a factor of 5!. Alright, let's break this down.

First, I remember that the exclamation mark in math stands for factorial. So 5! means 5 factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to 5. So 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1. Let me calculate that real quick. 5 times 4 is 20, multiplied by 3 is 60, times 2 is 120, and then 1 doesn't change anything. So 5! equals 120.

Now the question is asking for the greatest odd integer that is a factor of 120. Hmm, okay. So I need to find the largest odd number that divides 120 without leaving a remainder.

Wait, but 120 is an even number because it ends with a zero, which is even. So any factor of 120 that's even would be a multiple of 2. But we're looking for an odd factor, so I should ignore the even parts.

Let me think about the prime factors of 120. Breaking it down, 120 can be factored into primes. Let's do that. 120 divided by 2 is 60, divided by 2 again is 30, and again by 2 is 15. Now 15 is 3 times 5. So the prime factors are 2^3 × 3 × 5.

The odd part of this number would be the product of the odd prime factors. So that's 3 × 5, which is 15. So the greatest odd factor should be 15.

Wait, but let me make sure. Are there any larger odd factors? Let's list the factors of 120 and pick out the odd ones. The factors of 120 are:

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120.

Now the odd ones from this list are 1, 3, 5, 15. Oh, wait, 15 is the largest one. So yes, 15 is the answer.

Looking at the options, option I is 15. So I think the correct answer is I.

To determine the greatest odd integer that is a factor of \(5!\), we first calculate \(5!\):

\[
5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120.
\]

Next, we identify the prime factorization of 120:

\[
120 = 2^3 \times 3 \times 5.
\]

The odd factors of 120 are the product of its odd prime factors. Therefore, the greatest odd factor is:

\[
3 \times 5 = 15.
\]

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**I: 15**
