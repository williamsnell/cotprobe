Okay, so I have this question about Hume's view on morality. I'm a bit rusty on my philosophy, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what I know about David Hume. I remember he was a Scottish philosopher from the 18th century, associated with empiricism and skepticism.

The question is asking about the basis of morality according to Hume. The options are A through J, each representing different possibilities like cultural norms, reason, sympathy, etc. 

I think Hume was critical of the idea that reason alone can determine morality. Wait, wasn't there something about how reason is the slave of the passions? Oh right, he argued that reason by itself can't lead to moral conclusions. So reason isn't the basis of morality for him. That would eliminate option C.

Then, what about the role of emotions? I remember Hume talking about moral sentiments. He believed that morality arises from feelings rather than pure reason. So maybe it's something related to emotions. But let me think more precisely. 

In his Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morality, Hume discusses the role of sympathy. Sympathy is the ability to share the feelings of others, and he thought this was crucial for developing moral concepts. For example, when we see someone in distress, our sympathetic response leads us to approve of actions that alleviate their suffering as morally good. So sympathy is a key component here.

Looking at the options, I see option I is sympathy, and J is emotional responses. I need to decide between these two. Hume does emphasize emotions, but more specifically, he talks about sympathy as a mechanism. Emotional responses in general might be broader than what Hume intended. Sympathy is a particular kind of emotional response related to others' feelings.

So I think the answer is I: sympathy. 

Wait, let me double-check. Hume's moral theory is often contrasted with Kant's. Kant believed morality comes from reason and duty, while Hume said it's from sentiment. Hume's key idea is that moral distinctions are derived from a moral sense, which is rooted in our emotional makeup, particularly through sympathy. So yes, I'm confident that the answer is I.

Hume argued that morality is not based on reason alone, as he believed reason is subordinate to emotions. Instead, he emphasized the role of moral sentiments, particularly sympathy, which allows us to share and understand others' feelings. This sympathetic response is central to his theory of morality, making it the foundation of moral judgments.

Answer: I
