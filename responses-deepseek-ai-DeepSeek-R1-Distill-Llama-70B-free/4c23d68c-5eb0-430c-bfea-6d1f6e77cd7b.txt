Okay, so I have this question about how to declare an array in PL/I. I'm a bit rusty on my PL/I syntax, but I'll try to think it through.

From what I remember, PL/I is a procedural language developed by IBM, and it's known for its strong typing and structured programming features. Arrays in PL/I are declared with specific syntax, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact structure.

I think the general structure involves using the DCL keyword, which stands for DECLARE. So the declaration probably starts with DCL. Then, I believe you specify the data attributes, which would be the type, like INTEGER or CHARACTER, and any other attributes such as initial values or areas.

Next comes the array part. In PL/I, when you declare an array, you specify the dimensions. So I think after the data attributes, you have the name of the array, followed by the dimensions in parentheses. The dimensions are usually specified as fixed numbers or variables, but for declaration, it's probably fixed.

Wait, no. Wait. Let me think. The DCL statement in PL/I is used to declare variables, including arrays. The syntax for an array would involve the data type, the name, and then the dimensions.

So the order might be: DCL [data attributes] ARRAY name (dimension attributes);

Alternatively, I think the data attributes come first, then the array declaration. For example, something like DCL 1-dimensional array: DCL x(10) FLOAT; or DCL y(5,5) INT; 

Wait, but looking at the options, some have ARRAY as a keyword. Oh right, in PL/I, when declaring an array, you specify the ARRAY keyword. So the structure is: DCL [data attributes] ARRAY name (dimension) [attributes...];

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact order. Let's try to reconstruct. The basic declaration would start with DCL, then the data type and other attributes, then the word ARRAY, then the name and the dimensions in parentheses.

So putting it together: DCL data_attributes ARRAY name(dimensions);

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches this structure.

Option C says: DCL DATA ATTRIBUTES ARRAY NAME (DIMENSION ATTRIBUTES); 

Wait, that would be DCL followed by data attributes, then ARRAY, then name, then dimension attributes in parentheses. That seems to fit.

Alternatively, looking at option J: DCL ARRAY NAME (DIMENSION ATTRIBUTES) DATA ATTRIBUTES; No, that's not right because data attributes come before the array name.

Option G: NAME DCL DATA ATTRIBUTES ARRAY (DIMENSION ATTRIBUTES); No, because DCL should come first.

Option C: DCL DATA ATTRIBUTES ARRAY NAME (DIMENSION ATTRIBUTES); Wait, that would be DCL [data] ARRAY [name] (dimensions). Hmm, but in PL/I, the dimensions are part of the array declaration, so that seems correct.

Wait, but in some versions, the order is DCL name (dims) type. But I think in PL/I, the type comes before the array keyword.

Wait, perhaps the correct order is DCL data attributes, then the array name and dimensions.

Wait, maybe the correct syntax is: DCL name (dims) type; But no, that doesn't include the ARRAY keyword.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing it up with other languages. Let me think again.

In PL/I, the array declaration uses the ARRAY keyword. The syntax is: DCL [data attributes] ARRAY [name] (dimension attributes); 

So for example: DCL A(10) INT; would declare an array A of 10 integers. But how does that fit into the options?

Looking at the options, option J is: DCL ARRAY NAME (DIMENSION ATTRIBUTES) DATA ATTRIBUTES; No, that has data attributes after the dimensions. That's not right.

Option C: DCL DATA ATTRIBUTES ARRAY NAME (DIMENSION ATTRIBUTES); So that would be DCL [data] ARRAY [name] ([dims]); which matches what I was thinking. For example, DCL (10) ARRAY A(5); No, wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the data attributes include the type and initial values, etc.

Wait, perhaps the correct syntax is DCL followed by the data attributes, then the name, then the dimensions in parentheses. But with the ARRAY keyword.

Wait, another example: DCL 1-D ARRAY X(10) FIXED; This would declare a one-dimensional array X with 10 elements of type FIXED. So the structure is DCL [data attributes] ARRAY [name] (dimensions). 

So the general format would be: DCL data_attributes ARRAY name (dimension_attributes);

Looking back at the options:

Option C: DCL DATA ATTRIBUTES ARRAY NAME (DIMENSION ATTRIBUTES); That matches. So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but let me check another option. Option J says: DCL ARRAY NAME (DIMENSION ATTRIBUTES) DATA ATTRIBUTES; That would have data attributes after the dimensions, which doesn't fit.

So the correct answer is option C.
</think>

To declare an array in PL/I, the correct syntax involves using the `DCL` keyword followed by data attributes, the `ARRAY` keyword, the array name, and dimension attributes in parentheses. The general format is:

```
DCL DATA ATTRIBUTES ARRAY NAME (DIMENSION ATTRIBUTES);
```

This structure ensures that the data type and other attributes are specified first, followed by the array name and its dimensions. Among the given options, the one that matches this syntax is:

**C: DCL DATA ATTRIBUTES ARRAY NAME (DIMENSION ATTRIBUTES);**

This option correctly places the data attributes before the array name and dimensions, aligning with the proper PL/I array declaration syntax.
