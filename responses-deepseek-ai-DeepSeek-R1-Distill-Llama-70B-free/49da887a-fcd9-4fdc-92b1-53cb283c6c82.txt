Okay, so I've got this question about Milgram's obedience experiments. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking what percentage of participants thought they delivered the maximum shock possible. The options are A to J, each with different percentages.

First, I remember that Milgram's experiments were about obedience to authority figures. The setup was that participants were told to administer electric shocks to another person (who was actually an actor) every time they answered a question wrong. The shocks increased in voltage each time. The key point was seeing how far the participants would go, obeying the orders despite any moral reservations.

Wait, but the question is specifically about how many thought they delivered the maximum shock. So, I think the maximum shock was like 450 volts or something. In the experiment, a lot of people went all the way to that maximum. But how many believed they actually administered that shock?

I recall that in the original study, about 65% of participants went to the maximum shock. But the question is about their perceptionâ€”did they think they delivered it? Or maybe it's about how many thought they used the maximum, regardless of whether they actually did.

Wait, no, the question is phrased as "thought they delivered the maximum amount of shock possible." So, perhaps some participants didn't go all the way but thought they did. Or maybe the question is about the percentage who actually delivered it and whether they were aware.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. In Milgram's results, 65% of the participants administered the maximum 450-volt shock. But the question is about their belief. Did they think they gave the maximum? Or perhaps it's a trick question because the maximum was the last on the board, so those who went all the way would have known they delivered it.

Wait, but maybe some stopped earlier but thought they delivered the maximum. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is simpler. Since about 65% went to the maximum, perhaps around 65% thought they delivered it. But looking at the options, the closest would be 60% (option B) or 70% (option I).

Wait, I'm not sure. Another angle: I've read that when participants were debriefed, some expressed reluctance but obeyed. So, those who went to the maximum probably knew they delivered it. So if 65% went to the max, approximately 65% thought they delivered it. But the options don't have 65. The closest are 60 and 70.

Alternatively, maybe the exact figure is not 65 but something else. Wait, I think in the initial study, it was 26 out of 40, which is 65%. But maybe the question is referring to a different aspect. Wait, another thought: some participants might have thought they delivered a higher shock than they actually did because the actor would stop responding beyond a certain point. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to a follow-up study or variation. Or maybe the question is about how many believed they were administering lethal shocks. Wait, but lethal would be beyond 450. No, the maximum was 450. So perhaps the participants who went all the way believed they delivered 450 volts, which they thought was the maximum possible.

Wait, but the options don't have 65. So the closest lower would be 60%, option B, or higher 70%, option I.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is 100%, but that can't be right because only 65% went all the way. So 100% isn't correct. So which is it, 60 or 70?

Wait, I think I might have misremembered. Another approach: the question asks what percentage "thought" they delivered the maximum. So maybe some participants didn't go all the way but thought they did. Alternatively, the question might be referring to how many were certain they had delivered it.

Wait, no, the question is about delivering the maximum, so perhaps it's only those who went all the way would have thought they did. So if 65% went all the way, the percentage would be approximately 65%. So the closest option is 60 or 70. The options given are B:60, I:70.

Wait, but perhaps I'm mixing up. Let me think again. In the original Milgram experiment, about 65% of participants administered all the shocks up to 450 volts. So that's 65%. But the options don't have 65, so I have to choose between 60 and 70.

Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to a different statistic. Maybe in a variation of the experiment, or perhaps a different question. Wait, another thought: sometimes people report that 100% of participants went up to a certain point, but only 65% went all the way.

Wait, but the question is about the percentage who thought they delivered the maximum. So if 65% actually delivered it, then 65% would think they did. So perhaps the intended answer is 60% (option B), as it's the closest to 65.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of what I remember as the correct answer. I think the answer is around 65%, but since the options don't have that, maybe the intended answer is 60%, which is option B.

Wait, but I'm not completely sure. Another angle: perhaps the question is a bit different. For example, after the experiment, participants were asked if they thought they would administer the highest shock. But no, that's a different question.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum shock was not the last one. Wait, no, the maximum was the last one, labeled as 450 volts. So participants who reached that would know they delivered the maximum.

I think I'm going to go with 65%, but since it's not an option, the closest would be 60% (option B) or 70% (option I). I'm a bit torn. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is 100%, but that doesn't make sense because not all participants went that far.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question is about the percentage who thought they delivered a fatal shock. But in the experiment, the maximum was 450 volts, and the actor would stop responding before that. So perhaps participants thought they might have killed the other person. But I'm not sure how that relates to the question.

Wait, the question says "the maximum amount of shock possible." So if the machine only went up to 450, then delivering that would be the maximum. So the percentage would be those who went all the way, which is about 65%, so again, the closest option would be 60 or 70.

I think I'll have to make a choice. Between B (60) and I (70). Since 65 is closer to 60 than 70? Wait, 65 is 5 away from 60 and 5 away from 70. Hmm. Or perhaps the actual answer is 100%, but I can't see why.

Wait, perhaps another angle: in the initial experiment, all participants went up to 300 volts, but only 65% went to 450. So the percentage who delivered the maximum (450) is 65%. So the answer would be about 65%, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is 60% (option B) or 70% (option I). I'm not sure. But I think the correct answer is 65%, but since it's not present, perhaps the intended option is B:60.

Wait, but maybe the answer is 100% because all participants were deceived into thinking they delivered the maximum. No, that doesn't make sense because only 65% went all the way. So the rest wouldn't have thought they delivered the maximum.

Wait, maybe the question is phrased differently. Perhaps it's about how many participants thought they had delivered a lethal shock, which was beyond the maximum. But that's a different question.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to a different study or variation. But I think the original question refers to the maximum possible in the experiment, which was 450 volts. So I think the answer is approximately 65%, but since that's not an option, perhaps the closest is 60% (option B) or 70% (option I). Hmm.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question refers to a follow-up study where they asked participants what they thought. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's a trick, and the answer is 100% because the maximum was 450, so those who delivered 450 thought they gave the maximum. So 65% of participants thought they delivered the maximum. So the answer would be 65%, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is 60% or 70%.

I'm a bit stuck. I think the correct answer is approximately 65%, but among the options, 60% is option B and 70% is I. I'm not sure which one is intended. Wait, perhaps the correct answer is 100%, but that can't be right because not all participants went to 450.

Wait, another angle: maybe the question is asking how many thought they delivered the maximum, not necessarily how many actually did. So perhaps some participants who didn't go all the way thought they did. I'm not sure about that. But I don't think that's the case. I think the participants who went to 450 would know they delivered the maximum, and those who stopped earlier would know they didn't.

So, the percentage would be the same as those who delivered the maximum, which is about 65%. So again, between 60 and 70.

I think I'll go with 60%, option B, as the closest answer.

The question asks what percentage of participants in Milgram's obedience experiments thought they delivered the maximum amount of shock possible. Milgram's experiments involved participants administering electric shocks to an actor, with the maximum shock being 450 volts. Approximately 65% of participants administered this maximum shock. Since the options do not include 65%, the closest available choices are 60% (option B) and 70% (option I). Considering the context, the answer aligns with the percentage of participants who actually delivered the maximum shock, which is approximately 65%. Therefore, the closest option is 60%.

Answer: B
