Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about electromagnetic waves in a cavity and melting ice. Hmm.

Alright, the setup is that the energy from these electromagnetic waves is used to melt ice. The cavity's temperature in Kelvin is increased by a factor of two, and we need to find out by what factor the mass of ice that can be melted in a fixed time increases.

Wait, I remember something about blackbody radiation and the energy inside a cavity. Oh right, the Stefan-Boltzmann law! That's the one where the power radiated by a black body is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature. So the formula is P = εσA T^4, where P is the power, ε is emissivity, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, A is the area, and T is the temperature.

So the problem says the temperature is doubled. Let's call the initial temperature T and the new temperature 2T. The power emitted is proportional to T^4, so initially, it's P1 = σ T^4 multiplied by some constants. When the temperature is doubled, the new power P2 would be σ (2T)^4. Let's compute that: (2T)^4 is 16 T^4. So P2 is 16 times P1.

Wait, but how does this relate to the mass of ice melted? Oh right, the energy used to melt ice is the heat required. The heat Q needed to melt mass m of ice is Q = mL, where L is the latent heat of fusion. But the energy comes from the power over time. Since power is energy per unit time, the energy available in a fixed time Δt is P * Δt.

So the energy available from the cavity is E = P * Δt. Initially, E1 = P1 * Δt, and after temperature change, E2 = P2 * Δt. Since P2 is 16 P1, E2 =16 E1.

Now, the energy used to melt ice is E = m L. So initial energy E1 = m1 L → m1 = E1 / L. New energy E2 = m2 L → m2 = E2 / L = (16 E1) / L. So m2 =16 m1. That means the mass increases by a factor of 16.

Wait, but let me double-check. Oh wait, no. Because the question specifies that the time is fixed, so the energy is P multiplied by the same time. So when P increases by 16 times, the energy available increases by 16 times, which allows 16 times more ice to be melted, since the energy per mass is fixed (same L). 

So the factor is 16. Looking at the options, option I is 64, J is 16, so the correct answer would be J. No, wait, option J is 16, so yes, that's the factor by which the mass increases.
</think>

The problem involves the energy from electromagnetic waves in a cavity, which is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature according to the Stefan-Boltzmann law: \( P \propto T^4 \). When the temperature of the cavity is doubled, the power becomes \( P_2 = (2T)^4 / T^4 \cdot P_1 = 16P_1 \). 

The energy available to melt ice in a fixed amount of time is proportional to the power, so the energy increases by a factor of 16. Since the energy required to melt ice is \( Q = mL \) (where \( m \) is the mass and \( L \) is the latent heat of fusion), the mass of ice that can be melted also increases by a factor of 16. 

Thus, the correct answer is:

J: 16

Answer: J
