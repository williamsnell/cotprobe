Okay, so I've got this economics question here. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about exchange rates and the value of the dollar when certain economic changes happen. 

The scenario is that the demand for our exports rises while our taste for foreign goods falls off. Hmm. I remember that exchange rates are influenced by trade balances and other factors. Let me think about what each part does.

First, if the demand for our exports increases, that means other countries are buying more of our goods. So, our exports are going up. When people in other countries buy our exports, they need dollars to do so. So the demand for dollars should increase because foreigners need dollars to buy our stuff. More demand for dollars would make the dollar appreciate, right? Because if more people want dollars, the value goes up.

On the other hand, if our taste for foreign goods falls, that means we're buying fewer imports. So, we're not demanding as much of other countries' goods. That would mean we need less of their currencies, like euros or yen. Let me see. If we're buying less from them, the demand for their currencies decreases. But wait, how does that affect the dollar? Well, if the dollar is in higher demand (from exports) and less of it is being used to buy imports, the overall effect would be an increase in the value of the dollar.

So both factors are pointing towards the dollar appreciating. Because more exports mean higher dollar demand, and fewer imports mean less supply of dollars flowing out. So the dollar should go up in value.

Looking at the options, option E says the value of the dollar will tend to appreciate. That makes sense. Let me check the other options to be sure. 

Option A says exchange rates are affected but not the dollar's value. That doesn't make sense because exchange rates are directly tied to the dollar's value. Option C suggests initial depreciation then appreciation, but I don't see why it would depreciate first. Option D talks about exchange rates appreciating but not the dollar, which seems contradictory. 

Options B, F, G, H, I, J don't fit. So I think E is the correct answer.

The scenario involves two key factors: an increase in the demand for exports and a decrease in the taste for foreign goods. When demand for exports rises, foreigners need more dollars to purchase these goods, increasing the demand for dollars and tending to appreciate its value. Simultaneously, a fall in the taste for foreign goods reduces the demand for foreign currencies, as fewer dollars are used to purchase imports. This reduction in the supply of dollars flowing out further contributes to an appreciation of the dollar's value. Both factors collectively point toward the dollar appreciating.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect because exchange rates and the dollar's value are directly related; both are affected.
- **Option B**: Incorrect because the demand for foreign goods is falling, not rising.
- **Option C**: Incorrect because there is no indication of initial depreciation before appreciation.
- **Option D**: Incorrect because exchange rate appreciation implies dollar appreciation.
- **Option E**: Correct, as explained above.
- **Options F, G, H, I, J**: Incorrect because they do not align with the economic reasoning.

Thus, the correct answer is that the value of the dollar will tend to appreciate.

Answer: E
