Okay, so I've got this problem here about depreciation. Hmm, let me read it again. The Century Shoe Company bought a machine for $1200. They're depreciating it at 20% of the declining balance. I need to find the book value after 3 years. The options are A through J, and I have to pick the right one.

Alright, I remember that depreciation is the process of allocating the cost of an asset over its useful life. There are different methods, like straight-line and reducing balance. Oh right, this one is the declining balance method, which means the depreciation is calculated on the book value of the asset, which decreases each year.

So the formula for declining balance depreciation is: Depreciation each year = (Rate) × (Book Value at the beginning of the year). And the book value at the end of each year is just the starting book value minus that year's depreciation.

The machine was bought for $1200. The rate is 20%, so 0.20 as a decimal. Let's break it down year by year.

Year 1:
Depreciation = 20% of $1200. 0.20 * 1200 = $240.
So the book value at the end of Year 1 is 1200 - 240 = $960.

Year 2:
Depreciation is 20% of the new book value, which is $960.
0.20 * 960 = $192.
Book value after Year 2 is 960 - 192 = $768.

Year 3:
Depreciation is 20% of $768. Let's calculate that: 0.20 * 768 = $153.60.
So subtract that from last year's book value: 768 - 153.60 = $614.40.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see option I is $614.40. But wait, let me double-check because sometimes I might make a calculation mistake.

Let me recalculate each step.

Year 1: 1200 * 0.20 = 240. 1200 - 240 = 960. Correct.

Year 2: 960 * 0.20 = 192. 960 - 192 = 768. Correct.

Year 3: 768 * 0.20 = 153.6. 768 - 153.6 = 614.4. Yep, that's right.

Looking back at the options, option I is $614.40, which matches.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or misunderstand the method. Another way to compute this is using the formula for the declining balance method:

Book Value after n years = Initial Cost × (1 - rate)^n.

So plugging in the numbers: 1200 × (1 - 0.20)^3 = 1200 × (0.80)^3.

0.8 cubed is 0.512. 1200 * 0.512 = 614.4. So that matches what I got earlier.

So the correct answer should be I: $614.40.

To determine the book value of the machine after 3 years using the declining balance method, we calculate depreciation each year based on 20% of the current book value and subtract it to find the new book value.

**Year 1:**
- Initial book value: $1200
- Depreciation: \( 1200 \times 0.20 = 240 \)
- Book value after Year 1: \( 1200 - 240 = 960 \)

**Year 2:**
- Book value at start: $960
- Depreciation: \( 960 \times 0.20 = 192 \)
- Book value after Year 2: \( 960 - 192 = 768 \)

**Year 3:**
- Book value at start: $768
- Depreciation: \( 768 \times 0.20 = 153.60 \)
- Book value after Year 3: \( 768 - 153.60 = 614.40 \)

The book value after 3 years is $614.40, which corresponds to option I.
