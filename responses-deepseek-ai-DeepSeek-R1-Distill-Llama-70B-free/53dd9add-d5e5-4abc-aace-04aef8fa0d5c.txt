Okay, so I have this physics problem here about work done when stretching a steel wire. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think through it step by step.

Alright, the question says a force of 100 N is applied to a steel wire. The wire has a cross-sectional area of 2.0 mm² and is 2.0 meters long. It's stretched by 0.50 mm. They're asking how much work is done.

Wait, work done... I remember that work is force multiplied by distance. So W = F * d. But wait, in this case, the wire is stretched, so maybe it's not that straightforward. Oh right, because the force here might be related to Hooke's Law, where F = kx, but I'm not sure if that's necessary for calculating the work done.

Wait, the problem gives the force directly as 100 N, so maybe I don't need to worry about the elasticity or the stress calculations. Because if the force is given, the work done would just be force times the distance it's applied over, right?

So the force F is 100 N, and the distance stretched, d, is 0.50 mm. Oh wait, units! 0.50 mm is 0.50e-3 meters. So 0.0005 meters.

So work W = F * d = 100 N * 0.0005 m. Let me calculate that. 100 times 0.0005 is 0.05. So W = 0.05 N·m. Wait, but looking at the options, option F is 0.05 nt-m, which matches.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I oversimplified. Because sometimes in these problems, especially with springs or wires, they might involve potential energy. The work done should equal the elastic potential energy stored, which is (1/2) F * d, right?

Oh wait, wait! Oh yeah, because when you stretch something, the work done isn't just F*d. Because the force isn't constant throughout the stretching if it's elastic. So for a spring, F = kx, and the force varies as you stretch it. So the work done is the area under the force vs displacement graph, which is a triangle, so (1/2) F * d.

Wait, but does this apply here? The problem gives a force of 100 N required to stretch the wire by 0.50 mm. Does that mean that the force is constant? Or is that the maximum force at that point?

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. If the wire is being stretched beyond its proportional limit, then the force might not be constant. But in this problem, maybe we're meant to take it as a constant force, so the work is simply F*d.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a linear elastic case, and the 100 N is the force applied to cause the 0.50 mm extension. So in that case, the work done would be (1/2)*F*d, because the force increases from 0 to 100 N as you stretch it.

Wait, the problem says "a force of 100 N is required to stretch a steel wire... a distance of 0.50 mm." So that implies that 100 N is the force applied, and it results in a stretch of 0.50 mm. So maybe the force is constant? Or is it that 100 N is the force when the stretch is 0.50 mm, implying that the force varies as the stretch increases.

I'm a bit stuck here. Let's think. In Hooke's Law, F = kx, where k is the spring constant, and x is the stretch. The work done in stretching it from 0 to x is (1/2)kx². Since F = kx, then k = F/x. So substituting, work W = (1/2) F x.

So in that case, the work would be half of F times the distance stretched.

Wait, in the problem, F is 100 N, x is 0.0005 m. So W = 0.5 * 100 * 0.0005 = 0.5 * 0.05 = 0.025 J. Which is 0.025 N·m. Looking at the options, option G is 0.025 nt-m.

But wait, I'm getting conflicting possibilities. If the force is constant, W = F*d = 0.05 N·m (option F). If it's elastic (spring-like), then W= 0.5*F*d = 0.025 N·m (option G).

Which approach do I take? The question is about a steel wire under tension. For small strains, steel behaves elastically, so the force needed increases with extension. So the correct approach would be to use the elastic potential energy formula, which is (1/2) F * x.

Wait, but wait another thing. The problem states that the force is 100 N, which is applied to cause the extension. So that would be the force at maximum extension, not the average force. So the work done by the force would be the area under the F-x curve, which is a triangle, so (1/2)*F*x.

So then, work done is 0.5 * 100 N * 0.0005 m = 0.025 J.

Looking at the options, option G is 0.025 nt-m.

But wait, another approach: some problems, especially when the force is given as the necessary to produce a certain extension, might consider the work as F times the extension. Because perhaps they are assuming that the wire is being stretched at a constant force, which isn't physically accurate for a real wire but perhaps is how the problem is set up.

Hmm, but I think in reality, for a wire, the force varies with extension, so the correct approach is the (1/2) F x.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me try to think about units.

The options are in nt-m, which is N·m, same as joules.

So using F=100 N, x=0.5 mm = 0.0005 m.

If it's W=F*x, then 100 * 0.0005 = 0.05 J, which is option F.

But if it's (1/2) F x, then 0.5 * 100 * 0.0005 = 0.025 J, option G.

So which one is correct?

Wait, the problem says "a force of 100 N is required to stretch...". That suggests that 100 N is the force applied to achieve that stretch. So in reality, as you stretch the wire, the force increases from 0 to 100 N as the extension goes from 0 to 0.5 mm. So the work done is the average force times the distance, which is (0 + 100)/2 = 50 N average. So 50 N * 0.0005 m = 0.025 J. So that would be option G.

But wait, another way to think: sometimes, when the problem gives a specific force and the distance it's applied over, they just want you to multiply them, without considering the varying force. So for example, if you push with 100 N and move something 0.0005 m, the work is 0.05 J.

I'm a bit torn here. Let me think about the context of the problem. It's a steel wire; for small extensions, the behavior is approximately linear (Hookean), so the force increases linearly with extension. Therefore, the work done would be the area under the F-x graph, which is (1/2)*F*x.

So that would lead me to 0.025 J, which is option G.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option F is 0.05, which is twice that. So which is it?

Alternatively, perhaps the question is treating the force as constant. Like, perhaps they're simplifying and just want F*d without considering the varying force.

In that case, the answer would be F=100 N, d=0.0005 m, so W=0.05 J, option F.

But I thought in elastic cases, it's (1/2) F d.

Wait, perhaps I should check the formula for work done in stretching a wire. The elastic potential energy U is (1/2) F d, where F is the force applied and d is the extension. So the work done by the external force equals the potential energy stored, which is (1/2) F d.

So the answer would be 0.025 J, option G.

Wait, but another thought: if the wire is stretched by 0.5 mm, and the force is 100 N, is that the force at that extension (so F=100 N when x=0.5 mm), meaning that the work done is (1/2) * 100 * 0.0005 = 0.025 J.

Yes, that makes sense.

So the correct answer should be option G: 0.025 nt-m.
</think>

To determine the work done in stretching the steel wire, we analyze the problem as follows:

The force applied to the wire is given as 100 N, and the wire is stretched by a distance of 0.50 mm, which is equivalent to \( 0.0005 \, \text{m} \). The work done in stretching the wire can be calculated using the formula for elastic potential energy, which is:

\[
W = \frac{1}{2} F \cdot d
\]

Here, \( F = 100 \, \text{N} \) is the force required to stretch the wire, and \( d = 0.0005 \, \text{m} \) is the distance of stretching. Substituting these values:

\[
W = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 100 \cdot 0.0005 = 0.025 \, \text{N·m}
\]

This calculation assumes that the force varies linearly with the extension of the wire, which is consistent with Hooke's Law for small elastic deformations. The work done corresponds to the elastic potential energy stored in the wire.

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**G: 0.025 nt-m**
