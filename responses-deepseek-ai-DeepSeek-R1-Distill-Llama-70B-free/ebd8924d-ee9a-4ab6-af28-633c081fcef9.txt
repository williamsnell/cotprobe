Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here. It's about fluid flow and energy transfer. Hmm, let me see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question says a fluid has a flow rate of 5 lbm/sec. It passes through a pipe where heat is transferred at 50 Btu/sec. I need to find out how much work can be done by the system. Oh, and also find the inlet area given the specific volume.

Wait, the data given includes the velocity, enthalpy, and height at both entrance and exit. Oh right, this sounds like the steady flow energy equation, maybe the first law for a control volume. Yeah, the general form is something like Q - W = m*(h2 + (v2²)/2 + gz2) - m*(h1 + (v1²)/2 + gz1), or something like that. Because it's steady flow, the energy equation should apply.

Let me jot down the given data:

Flow rate (m_dot) = 5 lbm/s.

Heat transfer rate (Q_dot) = 50 Btu/s, but I think it's positive if heat is added. Wait, wait, in the problem statement, it's "heat is transferred at the rate of 50 Btu/sec." So I think that's Q_dot = 50 Btu/s. But wait, in thermodynamics, Q is positive when heat is added to the system. So if the system is the pipe, then if heat is being transferred into the system, Q would be positive. Or wait, the problem says "heat is transferred" but doesn't specify the direction. Hmm, but the answer options have negative work done. So maybe the heat is being lost by the system. Wait, no, wait, the work done by the system would be positive if it's doing work on the surroundings. But I need to be careful with the signs.

Wait, the problem says "how much work can be done by this system," so W would be positive if the system is doing work. But the options have negative values. Hmm, that could mean that the system is actually doing negative work, i.e., work is done on the system. Or maybe I have the sign conventions wrong.

Let me think again. The first law for a control volume (steady flow process) is:

Q_dot - W_dot = m_dot * [ (h2 - h1) + (v2² - v1²)/2 + g(z2 - z1) ]

Wait, but in some conventions, the work done by the system is positive, so it would be W_dot. So the equation would be:

Q_dot - W_dot = m_dot * [ (h2 - h1) + (v2² - v1²)/2 + g(z2 - z1) ]

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let's get the equation right.

The general form is:

Energy in = Energy out + accumulation. But since it's steady flow, accumulation is zero. So:

Q_dot - W_dot = m_dot [ (h2 + (v2²)/2 + gz2) - (h1 + (v1²)/2 + gz1) ) ]

So Q is heat added to the system, W is work done by the system. So if the system is doing work, W is positive.

Wait, but in the problem, the heat is being transferred to or from the system? The problem says "heat is transferred at the rate of 50 Btu/sec." Hmm, but the direction isn't specified. Wait, maybe I should proceed and see.

Given data:

At entrance (1):

Velocity (v1) = 100 ft/s

Enthalpy (h1) = 1000 Btu/lbm

Height (z1) = 100 ft

At exit (2):

v2 =50 ft/s

h2=1020 Btu/lbm

z2=0 ft

Specific volume (v) = 15 ft³/lbm. So at inlet, specific volume is 15. So inlet area A1 = m_dot * v / v1.

Wait, flow rate m_dot = 5 lbm/s. So A1 = (5 lbm/s) * (15 ft³/lbm) / (100 ft/s) = (75 ft³/s) / (100 ft/s) ) = 0.75 ft². Wait, but looking at the options, option J has 0.75 ft², and option E is 0.9, etc. But let me not get ahead of myself.

But first, I need to compute the work done. So the equation is:

Q_dot - W_dot = m_dot [ (h2 - h1) + (v2² - v1²)/(2*gc) + g*(z2 - z1) ]

Wait, but what are the units here? Because in the English system, sometimes we need to include the conversion factor for the kinetic and potential energy terms. Let me think about units.

In the English system, the specific energy terms are in Btu/lbm. So, we need to convert the velocity terms and height terms into Btu/lbm.

The kinetic energy per unit mass is (v^2)/(2*gc), where gc is the conversion factor 32.174 lbm·ft/(lbf·s²). But for energy in Btu, let's calculate.

1 Btu is approximately 778 ft·lbf. So let me compute the units.

So, for each term:

h is in Btu/lbm.

Kinetic energy: (v^2)/(2*gc) → (ft²/s²) / (lbm·ft/(lbf·s²)) ) → (ft·lbf)/(lbm) → which is (ft·lbf)/(lbm). Since 1 Btu = 778 ft·lbf, so (ft·lbf/lbm) = (1/778) Btu/lbm.

Similarly, the potential energy term is g*z, where g is in ft/s², z in ft, so g*z is ft²/s². Then, (g*z)/gc → (ft/s² * ft) / (lbm·ft/(lbf·s²)) → (ft²/s²) * (lbf·s²)/(lbm·ft)) ) → (ft·lbf)/(lbm), same as before, so again (1/778) Btu/lbm.

So to convert velocities and heights into Btu/lbm terms, we can calculate each term as follows:

( v² )/(2*gc) → (v²)/(2 * 32.174 * 778 ) Btu/lbm, because 1 ft·lbf = 1/778 Btu.

Similarly, the height term: g(z) = 32.174 ft/s² * z ft → (32.174 * z) ft²/s². Then divided by (gc * 778) gives it in Btu/lbm.

Wait, maybe another approach. Let me think of each term in consistent units.

Alternatively, compute each term in Btu/lbm by considering the conversion factors.

So, let me compute each term:

Change in enthalpy: h2 - h1 = 1020 - 1000 = 20 Btu/lbm.

Change in kinetic energy: (v2² - v1²)/(2*gc) → (50^2 -100^2)/(2 * 32.174) ft·lbf/lbm.

Wait, 50^2 is 2500, 100^2 is 10000, so difference is -7500 ft²/s².

Divide by (2 * 32.174) → -7500/(64.348) ≈ -116.47 ft·lbf/lbm.

Convert this to Btu/lbm: 1 Btu = 778 ft·lbf, so -116.47 / 778 ≈ -0.15 Btu/lbm.

Change in potential energy: g(z2 - z1) → 32.174 * (0 - 100) → 32.174*(-100) = -3217.4 ft²/s².

But wait, per unit mass, so (g*(z2 - z1))/gc → (32.174 * (-100)) / 32.174 = -100 ft·lbf/lbm ?

Wait, because (g*(Δz))/gc = Δz in ft, because the units would be (ft/s² * ft) / (lbm·ft/(lbf·s²)) ) = (ft²/s² * lbf s²)/(lbm ft) ) → (ft·lbf)/lbm.

So, (g*(z2 - z1))/gc = (32.174*(0-100))/32.174 = -100 ft·lbf/lbm.

Convert that to Btu: -100 /778 ≈ -0.1286 Btu/lbm.

So now, putting it all together.

The total specific energy change is:

Δh + ΔKE + ΔPE = 20 + (-0.15) + (-0.1286) ≈ 20 - 0.2786 ≈ 19.7214 Btu/lbm.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have messed up the signs. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, the kinetic energy change is (v2² - v1²)/(2*gc) → (50² -100²)/(2*32.174) → (2500 - 10000)= -7500 → -7500/(64.348) ≈ -116.47 ft·lbf/lbm → -116.47 /778 ≈ -0.15 Btu/lbm.

Potential energy change: (g(z2 - z1))/gc → (32.174*(0-100))/32.174 → (0-100) → -100 ft·lbf/lbm → -100/778 ≈ -0.1286 Btu/lbm.

So the sum is 20 (from h) + (-0.15) + (-0.1286) = 19.7214 Btu/lbm.

So the specific energy change is about 19.7214 Btu/lbm.

So the energy equation is Q_dot - W_dot = m_dot * (Δenergy) → 50 - W_dot =5 * 19.7214 → 5 * 19.7214 is about 98.607 Btu/s.

Wait, that would give 50 - W_dot ≈98.607 → W_dot ≈50 -98.607 → W_dot ≈-48.607 Btu/s.

Wait, but that doesn't match any of the options exactly. Let me check the calculations again because maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me recompute the kinetic and potential energy changes.

Compute (v2² - v1²) = 50² -100² = 2500 -10000 = -7500 ft²/s².

Divide by (2 * 32.174) → 64.348 → -7500 /64.348 ≈-116.47 ft·lbf/lbm.

Convert to Btu: -116.47 /778 ≈-0.1497 Btu/lbm.

Potential energy: z2 - z1 = 0 -100 = -100 ft.

(g*(z2 - z1))/gc → (32.174 * (-100)) /32.174 = -100 ft·lbf/lbm.

Convert to Btu: -100 /778 ≈-0.1286 Btu/lbm.

So Δh =20, ΔKE= -0.1497, ΔPE= -0.1286.

Total Δ= 20 -0.1497 -0.1286 =19.7217 Btu/lbm.

m_dot is 5 lbm/s → 5 *19.7217 ≈98.6085 Btu/s.

So, Q_dot is 50 Btu/s, and equation is Q - W = mΔ → 50 - W =98.6085 → W =50-98.6085 → W≈-48.6085 Btu/s.

So the work done by the system is approximately -48.6 Btu/s, meaning the system is having work done on it. So the work is negative.

Looking at the answer options, option J is -48.5 Btu/s and area 0.75 ft². Option A is -50 and 0.5, etc.

Wait, but let me check my calculations again because perhaps I made a mistake in the signs.

Wait, the equation is Q_dot - W_dot = m_dot*(Δh + ΔKE + ΔPE). So rearranged, W_dot = Q_dot - m_dot*(Δh +ΔKE + ΔPE).

So, W_dot =50 -5*(19.7217) →50 -98.6085 = -48.6085 Btu/s.

So approximately -48.6, which is closest to option J (-48.5) and option F (-49). Hmm, but the exact value is about -48.6, so which option is closer? Let's see the options.

Wait, the options are A to J. Looking at the options:

A: -50, 0.5

B: -50, 1

C: -45, 0.8

D: -42, 0.65

E: -43.5, 0.9

F: -49, 0.6

G: -45, 1.2

H: -40, 0.7

I: -47, 0.85

J: -48.5, 0.75.

So my calculation is -48.6085, which is close to option J (-48.5) and option F (-49).

Wait, but let me see if I made a mistake in the calculation of the energy terms. Let me do a more precise calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise conversion factors.

Let me compute the kinetic energy change again.

v1=100 ft/s, v2=50 ft/s.

v1² =10000, v2²=2500. So v2² -v1² = -7500 ft²/s².

Divide by 2*32.174 lbm-ft/(lbf-s²) → 64.348.

So, -7500 /64.348 ≈-116.47 ft·lbf/lbm.

Convert to Btu: 1 ft·lbf =1/778.169 Btu.

So, -116.47 * (1/778.169) ≈-0.1497 Btu/lbm.

Similarly, the potential energy change:

z1=100 ft, z2=0 ft. So Δz= -100 ft.

So, gΔz =32.174 * (-100) = -3217.4 ft²/s².

But in terms of energy per unit mass, it's (gΔz)/gc.

Wait, because energy per unit mass is (gΔz)/gc → (32.174 * (-100)) /32.174 → -100 ft·lbf/lbm.

So, -100 /778.169 ≈-0.1286 Btu/lbm.

So the sum is:

Δh =1020 -1000=20 Btu/lbm.

ΔKE =-0.1497 Btu/lbm.

ΔPE= -0.1286 Btu/lbm.

Total =20 -0.1497 -0.1286=19.7217 Btu/lbm.

Now, m_dot=5 lbm/s →5 *19.7217=98.6085 Btu/s.

So, Q_dot =50 Btu/s.

So, from the equation:

Q_dot - W_dot = m_dot * Δenergy → 50 - W =98.6085 → W=50-98.6085= -48.6085 Btu/s.

So approximately -48.61 Btu/s.

Looking back at the options, option J has W=-48.5, which is very close. Option F is -49, which is a bit further. So perhaps the correct answer is J.

But wait, let me check the calculation once more because perhaps I forgot something, like the sign of the work. Wait, the equation as I used it is W_dot = Q_dot - m_dot*(Δh + ...). Which comes from Q - W = mΔ → W = Q - mΔ.

So, if W comes out negative, that means the system is doing negative work, i.e., work is being done on the system. So, that's correct.

Now, the other part of the question: what is the area of the inlet?

Given specific volume v1=15 ft³/lbm, and m_dot=5 lbm/s, inlet velocity v1=100 ft/s.

The volumetric flow rate at inlet is m_dot * v1 =5 lbm/s *15 ft³/lbm=75 ft³/s.

Volumetric flow rate is also A * v → A = (75 ft³/s) / (100 ft/s) )=0.75 ft².

Which matches option J's area of 0.75 ft².

So, the work is approximately -48.6 Btu/s, and the area is 0.75 ft². So the correct option is J.
</think>

To solve the problem, we apply the steady flow energy equation:

\[
Q_{\dot} - W_{\dot} = \dot{m} \left[ (h_2 - h_1) + \frac{v_2^2 - v_1^2}{2} + g(z_2 - z_1) \right]
\]

### Given Data:
- Flow rate: \(\dot{m} = 5 \, \text{lbm/s}\)
- Heat transfer rate: \(Q_{\dot} = 50 \, \text{Btu/s}\)
- Entrance conditions: \(v_1 = 100 \, \text{ft/s}, h_1 = 1000 \, \text{Btu/lbm}, z_1 = 100 \, \text{ft}\)
- Exit conditions: \(v_2 = 50 \, \text{ft/s}, h_2 = 1020 \, \text{Btu/lbm}, z_2 = 0 \, \text{ft}\)
- Specific volume: \(v = 15 \, \text{ft}^3/\text{lbm}\)

### Step 1: Calculate the specific energy change
1. **Change in enthalpy**:
   \[
   \Delta h = h_2 - h_1 = 1020 - 1000 = 20 \, \text{Btu/lbm}
   \]

2. **Change in kinetic energy**:
   \[
   \Delta KE = \frac{v_2^2 - v_1^2}{2} = \frac{50^2 - 100^2}{2} = \frac{2500 - 10000}{2} = -3750 \, \text{
