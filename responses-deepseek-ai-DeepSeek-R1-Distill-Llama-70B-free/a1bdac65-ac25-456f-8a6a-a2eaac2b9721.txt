Okay, so I've got this question about the law of treaties and when a reservation is considered invalid. Hmm, I remember from my international law class that reservations are like exceptions that a state makes when they ratify a treaty. But not all reservations are allowed, right?

The question gives four options: A, B, C, D. Let me think about each one.

Option A says a reservation is invalid if the majority of state parties object. Wait, I think that's not necessarily the case. I recall that the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) has something about this. If a state makes a reservation, other states can object, but the reservation isn't automatically invalid just because some object. Each state decides for itself whether the reservation is acceptable. So it's possible for a reservation to stand even if some states object, unless it's about the human rights treaties maybe? Or wait, no, I think the general rule is that objections don't invalidate a reservation, they just mean that the treaty doesn't apply between the objecting and reserving states regarding that provision. So A might not be correct.

Option B states that a reservation is invalid only when an international tribunal says so. That doesn't sound right. I think the validity can be determined without a tribunal. Like, if a reservation violates jus cogens or the object and purpose, it's invalid regardless of a tribunal's ruling. Tribunals can decide, but it's not the only way. So B is probably incorrect.

Option C says a reservation is invalid only if it's incompatible with jus cogens. Jus cogens are peremptory norms that can't be derogated from. So if a reservation goes against them, it's invalid. But wait, is that the only scenario? I think there's another case where a reservation is invalid if it's contrary to the object and purpose of the treaty. So C says "only" which might make it incorrect because there's another condition.

Option D states that a reservation is invalid when incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty. That rings a bell. Yes, under the VCLT, a reservation is invalid if it's contrary to the object and purpose of the treaty. So D is definitely a correct scenario for invalidity.

Wait, but what about the case when it's against jus cogens? So both C and D could be correct situations for invalidity, but the options present them as separate choices. The question is asking when a reservation is considered invalid under the law of treaties.

Looking back, the VCLT (Article 19(c)) says a reservation is invalid if it's incompatible with the object and purpose. Additionally, if a reservation is against jus cogens, it's invalid, but that's a separate matter. However, the question is phrased as "when is a reservation invalid," so it's possible that both D and C are correct in different contexts. But the options are presented as A to D, so I have to choose the correct answer from the options.

Wait, the question is phrased as "when a reservation is considered as invalid under the law of treaties." So the VCLT specifically mentions the object and purpose. Jus cogens is a broader principle, but perhaps isn't directly in the VCLT's provisions on reservations.

Wait, let me think again. The VCLT's Article 19(c) says a reservation is invalid if it's incompatible with the object and purpose. So D is a correct scenario. As for C, jus cogens is a higher level; a reservation that violates jus cogens is invalid, but I'm not sure if the VCLT explicitly states that as a ground. Or maybe it's implied because jus cogens is a fundamental principle.

Wait, perhaps both C and D are correct, but looking at the options, the correct answer is either C or D. The question is a bit ambiguous. But in the VCLT, the explicit ground is the object and purpose. Jus cogens is more about the validity of treaties themselves, not specifically about reservations. So perhaps the correct answer is D.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be D: a reservation is invalid when it's incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty.

Under the law of treaties, a reservation is considered invalid if it is incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty. This principle is explicitly stated in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT), specifically under Article 19(c). While jus cogens (peremptory norms of international law) also plays a role in invalidating certain provisions, the VCLT specifically addresses reservations in relation to the object and purpose of the treaty. Therefore, the correct answer is:

D: A reservation is invalid when it is incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty.

Answer: D
