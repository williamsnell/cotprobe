Okay, so I've got this question about ethical guidelines in psychology, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me break it down step by step.

The question is about Alice A., who has a master's degree in clinical psychology but isn't licensed. She's been hired by a community mental health clinic to administer psychological tests to adults. The options are about whether this is acceptable or not under ethical guidelines.

First, I remember that in psychology, licensing is a big deal. Licensed psychologists typically have doctoral degrees (like a PhD or PsyD) and have completed certain requirements, including supervised experience. But wait, Alice only has a master's. But the question is about administering tests, not necessarily diagnosing or treating clients.

I think about the different roles in psychology. For example, in some places, individuals with master's degrees can work under supervision. They might not be licensed psychologists, but they can perform certain tasks like test administration under the supervision of a licensed professional.

Looking at the options, option D says it's unacceptable because she's not licensed. But I'm not sure if administering tests requires a license. I think the key here is whether she's practicing psychology, which usually requires a license. Administering tests might fall under the scope of practice, but if she's supervised, it might be acceptable.

Option E says it's acceptable as long as a professional clinical psychologist supervises her activities. That sounds plausible because having a supervisor who is licensed could make it okay for her to administer the tests, as she's not acting independently.

Option A says it's acceptable if a licensed psychologist co-signs her evaluations. Co-signing might be part of the process, but the question is about administering tests, not about the evaluations themselves. So maybe supervision during the administration is more important.

Option B points out she doesn't have a doctoral degree, but I don't think a doctoral degree is always required for test administration. It's more about the licensing and supervision.

Option F is similar to B, focusing on the PhD, which again, I think isn't the main issue here.

Option C talks about a professional counselor supervising her. That might not be sufficient because the supervisor should be a licensed psychologist, not just any counselor, especially when it comes to psychological testing.

Option G says it's acceptable if she's pursuing licensure. I don't think that's necessarily a factor. It's more about current qualifications and supervision.

Option H says it's unacceptable because she doesn't have specialization in testing. But the question states that the clinic is having her administer standard tests, which I assume she's trained for as part of her master's. Specialization might not be required as long as she's competent and supervised.

Option I mentions liability insurance. While important, it doesn't directly address the ethical issue of whether she's allowed to do the job without a license. Insurance is more about coverage in case of issues rather than the permission to perform tasks.

Option J says it's acceptable if she gets additional training and certification. But if she's already trained through her master's and is supervised, maybe that's not necessary. Unless the guidelines require specific certifications beyond the degree.

So putting it all together, the main issue is whether someone without a license can administer psychological tests. From what I recall, as long as they are under the supervision of a licensed psychologist, it's acceptable. So the answer would involve supervision by a licensed professional.

Looking back at the options, E says it's acceptable with a professional clinical psychologist supervising her activities. That fits with what I was thinking. So the correct answer should be E.

The question revolves around whether Alice A., who holds a master's degree in clinical psychology but is not licensed, can ethically administer psychological tests at a clinic. Ethical guidelines typically require that unlicensed individuals, even with advanced degrees, work under the supervision of a licensed professional when performing tasks within the scope of psychology. 

Option E states that this is acceptable as long as a professional clinical psychologist supervises Alice’s activities. This aligns with the understanding that supervision by a licensed psychologist ensures compliance with ethical standards, allowing Alice to administer tests without violating licensing requirements.

Other options are less accurate. For example, options B and F incorrectly emphasize the need for a doctoral degree, which is not necessarily required for test administration under supervision. Option C suggests supervision by a professional counselor, which may not be sufficient for psychological testing. Option D focuses on licensing, but supervision can mitigate this issue. Other options either introduce irrelevant factors or fail to address the key requirement of supervision by a licensed psychologist.

Thus, the most appropriate answer is:

E: acceptable as long as a professional clinical psychologist supervises Alice’s activities.
