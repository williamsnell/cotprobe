Question:

Given 2 colors whose HSI representations are given as follows: (a) $(pi, 0.3,0.5)$, (b) $(0.5 pi, 0.8,0.3)$, which color is brighter?

Options:

A: Brightness cannot be compared without additional information about the viewing conditions
B: (b) is brighter due to higher hue value
C: Cannot be determined from the given data
D: Brightness is subjective and cannot be determined from HSI values alone
E: (b) is brighter because it has a higher saturation and lower hue value
F: (a)
G: Both are equally bright
H: (b)

Okay, so I've got this question about colors in HSI representation, and I need to figure out which one is brighter. Hmm, let's start by recalling what HSI stands for. I think HSI stands for Hue, Saturation, Intensity. Oh wait, or is it Hue, Saturation, Brightness? Sometimes people use different terms, but I believe in this context, the third component is intensity, which relates to brightness.

The two colors given are (a) (π, 0.3, 0.5) and (b) (0.5π, 0.8, 0.3). So, each has three values. The first is hue, the second saturation, and the third must be intensity or brightness.

Wait, the question is about brightness. So the third value in each tuple should be the brightness. Let me double-check that. Yeah, I'm pretty sure in HSI, the third component is the intensity, which is a measure of brightness. So higher value means brighter.

Looking at color (a), the intensity is 0.5, and color (b) has an intensity of 0.3. So 0.5 is higher than 0.3. That would mean color (a) is brighter than color (b). 

But wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing this up with other color models. In HSV, which is similar, the third component is value, which is like brightness. So yes, that's the same idea. So if HSI is Hue, Saturation, Intensity, then the third is the brightness. 

So comparing the two, (a) has higher intensity (0.5 vs 0.3). So (a) is brighter. So the answer should be (a), which I think is option F since the options are labeled A to J, and looking at the options, F is labeled as (a). 

Wait, let me check the options again. Option F is labeled as (a), so that would be the correct choice. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The question is about brightness, not about lightness or anything else. So yes, the third value is the deciding factor here. So (a) is brighter.

The HSI color model represents colors using three components: Hue, Saturation, and Intensity. In this context, the third value in each tuple corresponds to the intensity, which directly relates to brightness. A higher intensity value indicates a brighter color.

For the given colors:
- Color (a) has an intensity of **0.5**.
- Color (b) has an intensity of **0.3**.

Since **0.5 > 0.3**, color (a) is brighter than color (b). Among the provided options, the correct answer is **F**, which corresponds to color (a).

F
