Okay, so I've got this matrix A, and I'm supposed to find f(99), where f is the minimal polynomial of A. Hmm, minimal polynomial, right. I remember that the minimal polynomial is the smallest degree monic polynomial that A satisfies. So, f(A) = 0.

First, I think I need to find the minimal polynomial of matrix A. To do that, I probably need to find the eigenvalues of A or look at its characteristic polynomial. Because the minimal polynomial divides the characteristic polynomial, right?

So, the characteristic polynomial is found by det(A - λI) = 0. Let me write down matrix A again to make sure I have it right.

Matrix A is:
[-2 -1 -1 -1]
[2  1  3  2]
[1  1  0  1]
[-1 -1 -2 -2]

Wait, the way it's written in the question, each row is separated by a backslash. So, the first row is [-2, -1, -1, -1], second [2,1,3,2], third [1,1,0,1], fourth [-1,-1,-2,-2]. Okay.

Now, to find the characteristic equation, I need to compute the determinant of (A - λI), where I is the identity matrix. That's a 4x4 determinant, which can be a bit tedious, but manageable.

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way. Let me see if I can compute the determinant step by step. So, the matrix (A - λI) would be:

[-2 - λ, -1,    -1,    -1     ]
[ 2,     1 - λ, 3,     2      ]
[1,     1,     -λ,    1      ]
[-1,   -1,    -2,    -2 - λ ]

Calculating the determinant of this 4x4 matrix... Hmm, perhaps I can perform row operations to simplify it. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, expand along the first row.

Wait, but maybe I can look for patterns or possible eigenvalues. For example, if I can find that A satisfies a certain equation, that might give me the minimal polynomial directly.

Another thought: perhaps A has some properties that make the minimal polynomial easy to find. Like, maybe it's a special kind of matrix, such as diagonalizable or nilpotent. But I don't think A is nilpotent because the trace isn't zero. Let me check the trace: the diagonal elements are -2, 1, 0, -2. So trace is -2 +1 +0 + (-2) = -3. So not nilpotent since trace isn't zero.

Wait, perhaps A is idempotent? That would mean A squared equals A. Let me check that. Hmm, computing A squared might take some time. Maybe that's not the quickest approach.

Alternatively, let's compute the characteristic polynomial. Let me proceed step by step.

The determinant of (A - λI) is:

| -2-λ   -1      -1      -1    |
|  2     1-λ     3       2     |
|  1     1      -λ       1     |
| -1    -1     -2      -2-λ   |

To compute this, I can expand along the first row.

So, the determinant would be:

(-2 - λ) * det of the minor matrix:
[1-λ   3     2    ]
[1     -λ    1    ]
[-1   -2   -2-λ ]

Minus (-1) times the determinant of the minor for the second element (but wait, the first row is [-2-λ, -1, -1, -1], so the elements are a, b, c, d = (-2-λ), -1, -1, -1.

Wait, the determinant expansion for the first row would be:

a*M11 - b*M12 + c*M13 - d*M14

Where M1j are the minors.

So, it's (-2 - λ) * M11 - (-1) * M12 + (-1)*M13 - (-1)*M14.

Wait, let me correct that. The general formula is:

det = sum_{j=1 to n} [ (-1)^{i+j} a_ij * M_ij ]

Since we're expanding along the first row (i=1), the signs will be (+ - + -) for j=1 to 4.

So:

det = (-2 - λ) * M11 - (-1) * M12 + (-1) * M13 - (-1) * M14

Wait, no: because for each element a_ij, the cofactor is (-1)^{i+j} a_ij * M_ij.

So for the first row (i=1), the cofactors are:

j=1: (+1) * a11 * M11
j=2: (-1) * a12 * M12
j=3: (+1) * a13 * M13
j=4: (-1) * a14 * M14

So the determinant is:

a11*M11 - a12*M12 + a13*M13 - a14*M14

Given that a11 = (-2 - λ), a12 = -1, a13=-1, a14=-1.

So, det = (-2 - λ) * M11 - (-1)*M12 + (-1)*M13 - (-1)*M14

Which simplifies to:

(-2 - λ) * M11 + M12 - M13 + M14

Now, each M1j is the determinant of the minor matrix when row 1 and column j are removed.

Let me compute each minor:

M11: the minor for element (1,1) is the determinant of the 3x3 matrix:

[1-λ   3     2    ]
[1     -λ    1    ]
[-1   -2   -2-λ ]

M12: remove first row and second column, so the minor is:

[2     3     2     ]
[1    -λ     1    ]
[-1  -2   -2-λ ]

Wait, no. Wait, M12 is the minor when we remove row 1 and column 2. So the matrix becomes:

Row 2: [2, 1-λ, 3, 2] → without column 2 → [2, 3, 2]
Row 3: [1, 1, 0, 1] → wait no, original matrix is (A - λI), so row 3 is [1, 1, -λ, 1], without column 2 → [1, -λ, 1]
Row 4: [-1, -1, -2, -2-λ] → without column 2 → [-1, -2, -2-λ]

Wait, no, (A - λI) for row 3 is [1, 1, -λ, 1], so removing column 2 gives [1, -λ, 1].

Similarly, row 4 is [-1, -1, -2, -2-λ], so removing column 2 gives [-1, -2, -2-λ].

So M12 is the determinant of:

[2   3   2]
[1  -λ   1]
[-1 -2 -2-λ]

Similarly, M13: remove column 3, so the minor matrix is:

[2   1-λ   2]
[1    1    1]
[-1  -1  -2-λ ]

And M14: remove column 4, so the minor is:

[2   1-λ   3 ]
[1    1    0 ]
[-1  -1   -2 ]

Wait, no, because in (A - λI), row 3's last element is 1, so when we remove column 4, row 3 becomes [1, 1, -λ]?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

The original (A - λI) matrix is:

Row 1: (-2-λ, -1, -1, -1)
Row 2: (2, 1-λ, 3, 2)
Row 3: (1, 1, -λ, 1)
Row 4: (-1, -1, -2, -2-λ)

So when we remove row 1 and column j to get M1j:

For M11 (j=1), the minor matrix is:

Row 2: [1-λ, 3, 2]
Row 3: [1, -λ, 1]
Row 4: [-1, -2, -2-λ]

Similarly, M12 (j=2) is:

Row 2: [2, 3, 2]
Row 3: [1, -λ, 1]
Row 4: [-1, -2, -2-λ]

Wait, no, because when removing column 2, row 2 becomes [2, 3, 2], row 3 becomes [1, -λ, 1], row 4 becomes [-1, -2, -2-λ].

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake earlier. When you remove row 1 and column j, each minor M1j is the determinant of the submatrix formed by removing row 1 and column j.

So for M11, remove row 1 and column 1, so the submatrix is:

Row 2: columns 2,3,4 → [1-λ, 3, 2]
Row 3: [1, -λ, 1]
Row 4: [-1, -2, -2-λ]

Similarly, M12: remove row 1 and column 2 → submatrix is:

Row 2: columns 1,3,4 → [2, 3, 2]
Row 3: columns 1,3,4 → [1, -λ, 1]
Row 4: columns 1,3,4 → [-1, -2, -2-λ]

Wait, no. Wait, row 2's columns when column 2 is removed would be [2,3,2], row 3 would be [1, -λ, 1], and row 4 would be [-1, -2, -2-λ].

Wait, but (A - λI) row 4 is [-1, -1, -2, -2-λ]. So when column 2 is removed, it's [-1, -2, -2-λ].

So M12 is the determinant of:

[2   3    2]
[1  -λ    1]
[-1 -2 -2-λ]

Similarly, M13 is the determinant when we remove column 3:

Row 2: [2, 1-λ, 2]
Row 3: [1, 1, 1]
Row 4: [-1, -1, -2-λ]

Wait, no: (A - λI) row 2 is [2,1-λ,3,2], so removing column 3 gives [2,1-λ,2].

Row 3 is [1,1,-λ,1], removing column 3 → [1,1,1].

Row 4 is [-1,-1,-2,-2-λ], removing column 3 → [-1,-1,-2-λ].

So M13 is determinant of:

[2   1-λ   2]
[1    1    1]
[-1  -1  -2-λ]

Similarly, M14 is the determinant when column 4 is removed, so the submatrix is:

Row 2: [2,1-λ,3]
Row 3: [1,1,-λ]
Row 4: [-1,-1,-2]

Wait, (A - λI) row 2 is [2,1-λ,3,2], so removing column 4 gives [2,1-λ,3].

Row 3: [1,1,-λ,1] → [1,1,-λ].

Row 4: [-1,-1,-2,-2-λ] → [-1,-1,-2].

So M14 is the determinant of:

[2   1-λ   3]
[1    1   -λ]
[-1  -1   -2]

Now, calculating each minor M11, M12, M13, M14.

Let me compute each one step by step.

First, M11:

M11 = |1-λ   3     2    |
       |1    -λ    1    |
       |-1   -2  -2-λ |

Let me compute this determinant.

Using the rule for 3x3 determinants:

= (1-λ)[(-λ)(-2-λ) - (1)(-2)] - 3[(1)(-2-λ) - (1)(-1)] + 2[(1)(-2) - (-λ)(-1)]

Compute each term:

First term: (1-λ)[ (λ(2 + λ)) + 2 ]
Wait, because (-λ)(-2 - λ) = λ(2 + λ), and (1)(-2) is -2, but since it's subtracted, it becomes +2.

So first term: (1-λ)[λ(2 + λ) + 2]

Let me expand that:

λ(2 + λ) = 2λ + λ²
So inside the brackets: 2λ + λ² + 2.

So first term: (1-λ)(λ² + 2λ + 2)

Second term: -3 [ (1)(-2 - λ) - (1)(-1) ]

Compute inside:

( -2 - λ + 1 ) = (-1 - λ)
So second term: -3*(-1 - λ) = 3(1 + λ)

Third term: 2 [ (1)(-2) - (-λ)(-1) ]

Compute inside:

-2 - (λ)(1) = -2 - λ

So third term: 2*(-2 - λ) = -4 - 2λ

Now, putting it all together:

M11 = (1-λ)(λ² + 2λ + 2) + 3(1 + λ) -4 -2λ

Let me expand (1-λ)(λ² + 2λ + 2):

= 1*(λ² + 2λ + 2) - λ*(λ² + 2λ + 2)
= λ² + 2λ + 2 - λ³ - 2λ² -2λ
= -λ³ - λ² + 0λ + 2

So M11 becomes:

(-λ³ - λ² + 2) + 3 + 3λ -4 -2λ

Combine like terms:

-λ³ - λ² + 2 + 3 + 3λ -4 -2λ
= -λ³ - λ² + (2+3-4) + (3λ -2λ)
= -λ³ - λ² + 1 + λ

So M11 = -λ³ - λ² + λ + 1

Now, moving on to M12.

M12 is determinant of:

[2   3    2]
[1  -λ    1]
[-1 -2 -2-λ]

Compute this determinant.

Again, using the 3x3 rule:

= 2[(-λ)(-2-λ) - (1)(-2)] -3[(1)(-2-λ) - (1)(-1)] +2[(1)(-2) - (-λ)(-1)]

Compute each term:

First term: 2 [ λ(2 + λ) + 2 ]

= 2 [ 2λ + λ² + 2 ]

= 2λ² +4λ +4

Second term: -3 [ (-2 - λ +1) ]

= -3 [ (-1 - λ) ]

= 3(1 + λ)

Third term: 2 [ -2 - (λ)(1) ]

= 2*(-2 - λ) = -4 - 2λ

Putting it all together:

M12 = (2λ² +4λ +4) + 3(1 + λ) -4 -2λ

Expand:

2λ² +4λ +4 +3 +3λ -4 -2λ

Combine terms:

2λ² + (4λ +3λ -2λ) + (4 +3 -4)
= 2λ² +5λ +3

So M12 = 2λ² +5λ +3

Next, M13:

M13 is the determinant of:

[2   1-λ   2]
[1    1    1]
[-1  -1  -2-λ]

Compute this:

= 2*(1*(-2 -λ) - 1*(-1)) - (1-λ)*(1*(-2 -λ) - 1*(-1)) +2*(1*(-1) -1*(-1))

Let me compute each component:

First term: 2*[ (1*(-2 -λ)) - (1*(-1)) ] = 2*[ (-2 -λ) +1 ] = 2*(-1 -λ) = -2 -2λ

Second term: - (1-λ) * [ (1*(-2 -λ)) - (1*(-1)) ] 
= - (1-λ) * [ (-2 -λ) +1 ]
= - (1-λ) * (-1 -λ)
= - [ (1)(-1 -λ) - λ*(-1 -λ) ]
= - [ (-1 -λ) + λ + λ² ]
= - [ (-1) + 0λ + λ² ]
= - [ λ² -1 ]
= -λ² +1

Wait, perhaps an alternative way:

Alternatively, compute each minor step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps expanding the determinant directly:

= 2*(1*(-2 -λ) -1*(-1)) - (1-λ)*(1*(-2 -λ) -1*(-1)) +2*(1*(-1) -1*(-1))

Compute each part:

First term (from 2):

1*(-2 -λ) = -2 -λ; 1*(-1) = -1. So -2 -λ - (-1) = -2 -λ +1 = -1 -λ. Multiply by 2: 2*(-1 -λ) = -2 -2λ.

Second term (from -(1-λ)):

Inside: 1*(-2 -λ) = -2 -λ; 1*(-1) = -1.
