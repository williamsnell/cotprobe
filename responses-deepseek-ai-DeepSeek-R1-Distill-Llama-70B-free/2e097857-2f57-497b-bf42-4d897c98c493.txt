Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about gas effusion. Hmm, I remember that effusion has to do with how fast gases escape through a small hole. Oh right, Graham's Law! It says that the rate of effusion is inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass. So the lighter the gas, the faster it effuses.

The question says helium effuses 5.33 times faster than an unknown gas. Wait, so helium is the faster one. That means the unknown gas must have a higher molar mass than helium. Because since He is lighter, it goes out quicker.

Helium's molar mass is about 4 g/mol. Let me think about the formula. Graham's Law is Rate1/Rate2 = sqrt(M2/M1). Here, Rate1 is helium's rate, Rate2 is the unknown. So Rate1 is 5.33 times Rate2. So plugging in, 5.33 = sqrt(M2/4). To find M2, I can square both sides.

5.33 squared is... let me calculate that. 5 squared is 25, 0.33 squared is about 0.1089, but wait, wait, (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b². So (5 + 0.33)^2 = 5² + 2*5*0.33 + 0.33² = 25 + 3.3 + 0.1089 ≈ 28.4089. So M2 = 4 * 28.4089 ≈ 113.6356 g/mol.

Wait, that's a bit high. Let me double-check the calculation. Oh wait, no, wait. Because 5.33 is Rate1/Rate2, which equals sqrt(M2/M1). So rearranging, M2 = (Rate1^2) * M1. So yes, (5.33)^2 *4.

Wait, let me compute 5.33 squared again more accurately. 5 *5 is 25, 5*0.33 is 1.65, so (5 + 0.33)^2 = 25 + 2*(5 * 0.33) + (0.33)^2. So 2*(5*0.33)=3.3, and 0.33^2 is 0.1089. So 25 +3.3 =28.3 +0.1089=28.4089. So 28.4089 *4=113.6356 g/mol. So the unknown gas has a molar mass around 114 g/mol.

Looking at the options, let's see. The options are:

A: Ne (20.18)
B: CO2 (44)
C: Ar (about 40)
D: CH4 (16)
E: O2 (32)
F: C5H12 (72)
G: SO2 (64)
H: N2 (28)
I: H2O (18)
J: C8H18 (114 g/mol? Let me check. Carbon is 12, hydrogen 1. So 8*12=96, 18*1=18. 96+18=114. Yes.)

So option J is C8H18, which has a molar mass of 114 g/mol. That matches the M2 we calculated. So the unknown gas is most likely octane (C8H18), option J.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure all other options don't have similar molar masses. For example, option F is C5H12: 5*12=60 +12=72. Not close. Option G is SO2: 32+32=64. No. Option J is the only one near 114.

To determine which gas is most likely to effuse 5.33 times slower than helium, we use Graham's Law of Effusion, which states:

\[
\frac{\text{Rate}_1}{\text{Rate}_2} = \sqrt{\frac{M_2}{M_1}}
\]

Here:
- \( \text{Rate}_1 \) is the rate of helium (\( \text{He} \)), and \( \text{Rate}_2 \) is the rate of the unknown gas.
- \( M_1 \) is the molar mass of helium (\( 4 \, \text{g/mol} \)), and \( M_2 \) is the molar mass of the unknown gas.

Given that \( \frac{\text{Rate}_1}{\text{Rate}_2} = 5.33 \), we can solve for \( M_2 \):

\[
5.33 = \sqrt{\frac{M_2}{4}}
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
M_2 = 5.33^2 \cdot 4
\]

Calculating \( 5.33^2 \):

\[
5.33^2 = 28.4089
\]

Thus:

\[
M_2 = 28.4089 \cdot 4 = 113.6356 \, \text{g/mol}
\]

The unknown gas has a molar mass of approximately \( 114 \, \text{g/mol} \). Among the given options, only **C\(_8\)H\(_{18}\)** (octane) has a molar mass of \( 114 \, \text{g/mol} \) (\( 8 \cdot 12 + 18 \cdot 1 = 96 + 18 = 114 \)).

Therefore, the unknown gas is most likely **C\(_8\)H\(_{18}\)**.
