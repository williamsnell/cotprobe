Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about religions, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is asking which pair of religions are both universalizing religions. The options are from A to J, each pairing different religions. I remember that universalizing religions are ones that believe their message is for everyone, not just a specific group. They often try to convert others to their belief.

First, I need to recall which religions are classified as universalizing. From what I learned, the main universalizing religions are Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, and sometimes Sikhism. These religions typically have a proselytic mission, meaning they actively seek converts. They believe their teachings are applicable to all people, regardless of where they're from.

Looking at the options:

A: Christianity and Buddhism. Both are universalizing. Christianity definitely is, and Buddhism, especially in its missionary forms like in the West, is considered universalizing. So A could be a correct pair.

B: Taoism and Shinto. I think both of these are ethnic religions, not universalizing. Taoism is more about Chinese culture and Shinto is tied to Japanese culture. So B is probably not the answer.

C: Judaism and Buddhism. Judaism is an ethnic religion, primarily for the Jewish people. Buddhism is universalizing, so C has one universalizing and one ethnic. So C isn't correct.

D: Hinduism and Buddhism. Hinduism is an ethnic religion, mainly for people in India or of Indian descent. Buddhism, as I thought before, is universalizing. So D is one of each, not both universalizing.

E: Islam and Sikhism. Islam is definitely universalizing. Sikhism, I'm a bit fuzzy on, but I think it's also considered a universalizing religion because it seeks to spread its teachings beyond just a specific group. So E could be a correct pair.

F: Taoism and Islam. Taoism is ethnic, Islam is universalizing. So F has one of each, not both universalizing.

G: Shinto and Hinduism. Both are ethnic, so G isn't correct.

H: Sikhism and Judaism. Sikhism I'm considering as universalizing, but Judaism is ethnic. So H has one of each, not both.

I: Islam and Judaism. Islam is universalizing, Judaism is ethnic. So I isn't correct.

J: Zoroastrianism and Judaism. I think Zoroastrianism is more of an ethnic religion tied to the Parsee community, so J has both as ethnic, not universalizing.

Wait, so the options that have both as universalizing are A and E. Let me make sure I didn't miss any others.

So, looking again:

Option E: Islam and Sikhism. I think Sikhism is a universalizing religion because it's not tied to a specific ethnicity and aims to spread its message. So both are universalizing.

Option A: Christianity and Buddhism. Both are definitely universalizing.

So both A and E are possible correct answers. But I need to check the options again. The question asks which pair is both universalizing. So if both A and E are correct, but in the options, perhaps only one is present.

Wait, looking back, the options are from A to J, each with different pairs. So perhaps the correct answer is either A or E.

Wait, but the question gives only one correct answer, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, I thought that both are correct, but perhaps let me think again. Let me list the religions:

Universalizing religions: Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Sikhism.

Ethnic/tribal religions: Judaism, Hinduism, Shinto, Taoism, Zoroastrianism.

So, checking the options:

A: Christianity and Buddhism – both universalizing. So correct.

E: Islam and Sikhism – both universalizing. So E is correct as well.

Wait, but looking at the options, which one is among the choices. The question is which pair is both universalizing. So both A and E are correct pairs.

But the options are A-J, and only one of them is correct. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake about Sikhism. Wait, is Sikhism considered a universalizing religion? Or is it more of an ethnic religion?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. Sikhism was founded in India and is based on the teachings of Guru Nanak. It emphasizes spiritual growth and doing good deeds, and is open to people from all backgrounds. So I think it's considered a universalizing religion because it's not limited to a specific ethnic group. So E would indeed be correct.

But the question asks for which pair is both universalizing. So in the options, both A and E should be correct, but looking at the options, only one is present. Wait, no, looking at the options, both A and E are present as options. Wait, wait, no. The options are A to J, each with a different pair. So if both A and E are correct, but the question expects one answer, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the answer is both A and E. But the options don't have both. Or maybe the answer expects one. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: Christianity and Buddhism → both universalizing.

E: Islam and Sikhism → both universalizing.

So both A and E are correct. But the question gives only one answer. Hmm, perhaps in the answer, only one is present. Or maybe I'm mistaken about Sikhism.

Wait, perhaps Sikhism is not classified as a universalizing religion. Maybe it's considered more of a regional or ethnic religion. Hmm, but I thought it's universal because it's not tied to a specific ethnicity. 

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is A and E, but in the options, only one is given. Wait, the question is from a textbook, and perhaps it's considering only the major ones. So perhaps the intended answer is A: Christianity and Buddhism.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer includes both, but in the options, only one is given. Wait, perhaps the question expects only one correct answer. So I need to see which of A or E is correct.

Wait, the options are:

A: Christianity and Buddhism → both universalizing.

E: Islam and Sikhism → both universalizing.

So the question has two correct options, but perhaps the intended answer is A because it's more commonly recognized. Or perhaps the question expects both A and E to be correct, but that's not possible as the options are single letters.

Wait, maybe I should look for the answer that's present in the options. Let me think again about the classification.

Judaism is ethnic, so any option pairing it with a universalizing is incorrect except if the other is also universalizing.

Wait, Zoroastrianism is ethnic, so J is incorrect.

Looking back, the correct answer must be either A or E.

But the options are A and E. So I'm a bit stuck because both seem correct. However, perhaps the intended answer is A, as it's more commonly tested.

Wait, but looking up, in most textbooks, the universalizing religions are Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, and sometimes Sikhism. So both A and E are correct.

But looking at the options provided, perhaps the correct answer is A because both are definitely universalizing, and maybe E is incorrect because Sikhism is not considered universalizing in the context of the question.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E, as both are universalizing.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to think of another approach. The question is from a test, so perhaps the correct answer is A.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, in some classifications, Sikhism is considered a regional religion, but I think that's not accurate. Sikhism is meant to be for all humanity, so it's universalizing.

So both A and E are correct. But the options don't have both. Wait, looking again, the options are A: Christianity and Buddhism; E: Islam and Sikhism.

So both are correct, but perhaps the intended answer is A because it's more standard.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E because both are Abrahamic and Sikhism is universalizing.

Wait, perhaps I should look for which options are correct. Let me consider each option:

A: Christianity (universalizing) and Buddhism (universalizing) → correct.

E: Islam (universalizing) and Sikhism (universalizing) → correct.

So both A and E are correct. But that's impossible because the options are single letters.

Wait, perhaps the question expects one correct answer, so perhaps the intended answer is A, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the answer key says A. Alternatively, perhaps it's E.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Another approach: Which of the options have both as universalizing.

So:

A: Yes.

E: Yes.

So the correct answers should be both A and E, but in the options, they are separate. So perhaps the intended answer is A.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question considers only the major ones, so A is correct.

I think I'll go with A as the answer because it's more commonly recognized as a pair of universalizing religions.

To determine which pair of religions are both universalizing religions, it is important to first identify which religions fall into this category. Universalizing religions are those that believe their message is applicable to everyone, regardless of cultural or ethnic background, and often actively seek converts. The major universalizing religions include Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, and Sikhism. Ethnic religions, on the other hand, are typically tied to a specific culture or region and do not actively seek converts.

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Christianity and Buddhism**  
  Christianity is a classic example of a universalizing religion, as it actively seeks converts worldwide. Buddhism, particularly in its missionary forms, is also considered universalizing. Both religions fit the criteria, making this pair correct.

- **B: Taoism and Shinto**  
  Taoism and Shinto are both ethnic religions, closely tied to Chinese and Japanese cultures, respectively. Neither is universalizing, so this pair is incorrect.

- **C: Judaism and Buddhism**  
  Judaism is an ethnic religion, primarily for the Jewish people, while Buddhism is universalizing. This pair includes one universalizing and one ethnic religion, so it is incorrect.

- **D: Hinduism and Buddhism**  
  Hinduism is an ethnic religion, mainly for people of Indian descent, while Buddhism is universalizing. This pair also includes one universalizing and one ethnic religion, so it is incorrect.

- **E: Islam and Sikhism**  
  Islam is a universalizing religion, actively seeking converts worldwide. Sikhism is also considered universalizing, as it is open to people of all backgrounds and seeks to spread its teachings globally. Both religions fit the criteria, making this pair correct.

- **F: Taoism and Islam**  
  Taoism is an ethnic religion, while Islam is universalizing. This pair includes one universalizing and one ethnic religion, so it is incorrect.

- **G: Shinto and Hinduism**  
  Both Shinto and Hinduism are ethnic religions, so this pair is incorrect.

- **H: Sikhism and Judaism**  
  Sikhism is universalizing, but Judaism is an ethnic religion. This pair includes one universalizing and one ethnic religion, so it is incorrect.

- **I: Islam and Judaism**  
  Islam is universalizing, but Judaism is an ethnic religion. This pair includes one universalizing and one ethnic religion, so it is incorrect.

- **J: Zoroastrianism and Judaism**  
  Zoroastrianism is an ethnic religion, and Judaism is also an ethnic religion. Neither is universalizing, so this pair is incorrect.

From the analysis, both **A: Christianity and Buddhism** and **E: Islam and Sikhism** are correct pairs of universalizing religions. However, since the question requires selecting only one answer, **A: Christianity and Buddhism** is the most commonly recognized and standard pair in such contexts.

Answer: A
