Okay, so I have this linear algebra question here, and I need to figure out which of the statements I, II, III are true. Let me go through each one step by step.

First, the question states that A and B are n x n matrices with real entries. So they're square matrices, and all the entries are real numbers. That's important because sometimes properties can differ if the matrices have complex entries, but here it's real.

Now, the three statements:

I. The trace of A squared is nonnegative.
II. If A squared equals A, then the trace of A is nonnegative.
III. The trace of AB is the product of the traces of A and B.

I need to evaluate each of these.

Starting with statement I: The trace of A² is nonnegative. Hmm. Okay, trace is the sum of the diagonal elements. For A², which is A multiplied by itself. So what do I know about the trace of A squared?

I remember that for any real square matrix, the trace of A squared is equal to the sum of the squares of the eigenvalues. Because trace is invariant under similarity transformations, and the eigenvalues of A² are the squares of the eigenvalues of A.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The eigenvalues of A squared are the squares of the eigenvalues of A. So if λ is an eigenvalue of A, then λ² is an eigenvalue of A². So the trace of A² is the sum of λ_i² for all i. But squares are always nonnegative, so their sum must be nonnegative. Therefore, statement I is true.

So I is correct.

Moving on to statement II: If A² equals A, then the trace of A is nonnegative. So A² = A implies that A is idempotent. I remember that for idempotent matrices, their eigenvalues are either 0 or 1. Because if A² = A, then for any eigenvalue λ of A, λ² = λ, so λ is 0 or 1.

Therefore, the trace of A, which is the sum of eigenvalues, would be the number of 1's, since 0's don't contribute. So trace(A) is equal to the rank of A (since for idempotent matrices, trace equals rank). And the rank is a nonnegative integer, so trace(A) is nonnegative. So statement II is true.

So II is correct.

Now statement III: The trace of AB is the product of the traces of A and B. Hmm, I think this is not generally true. Let me think about the properties of trace. One key property is that trace(AB) = trace(BA) for any two matrices where the product is defined. But does it equal the product of traces?

Wait, let's take a simple example. Let A and B be 2x2 matrices. Let A be the identity matrix, so trace(A) is 2. Let B be the identity matrix as well. Then AB is identity, so trace(AB) is 2. The product of traces is 2*2=4. So 2 is not equal to 4. So in this case, statement III is false.

Alternatively, another example: let A be a zero matrix. Then trace(A) is 0. Let B be any matrix; trace(AB) is trace of the zero matrix, which is 0. The product of traces is 0 times trace(B) which is 0. So in this case, it's equal. But the first example showed it's not always true. So statement III is false.

So putting it all together: statements I and II are true, III is false. Now, looking at the options:

The options are:

A: All of them (I, II, III) → No, because III is false.

B: I, II, III → Same as A, incorrect.

C: I only → No, II is also correct.

D: I and III → No, III is wrong.

E: II, III, I → No, III is wrong.

F: III only → No.

G: II only → No, I is also correct.

H: I and II only → Yes, this is correct.

I: II and III → No, because III is wrong.

J: None → No, because I and II are correct.

So the correct answer is option H: I and II only.

To determine which of the statements I, II, and III are true, we analyze each one carefully:

1. **Statement I: The trace of \( A^2 \) is nonnegative.**  
   The trace of a matrix is the sum of its eigenvalues. For \( A^2 \), the eigenvalues are the squares of the eigenvalues of \( A \). Since squares of real numbers are always nonnegative, the sum of these squares (the trace of \( A^2 \)) is also nonnegative. Therefore, **Statement I is true**.

2. **Statement II: If \( A^2 = A \), then the trace of \( A \) is nonnegative.**  
   If \( A^2 = A \), \( A \) is idempotent. The eigenvalues of an idempotent matrix are either 0 or 1. The trace of \( A \), being the sum of its eigenvalues, is the number of 1's (which is nonnegative). Hence, **Statement II is true**.

3. **Statement III: The trace of \( AB \) is the product of the traces of \( A \) and \( B \).**  
   This is not generally true. For example, if \( A \) and \( B \) are both the \( 2 \times 2 \) identity matrix, the trace of \( AB \) is 2, but the product of the traces is \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \). Since 2 ≠ 4, **Statement III is false**.

From this analysis, Statements I and II are true, while Statement III is false. Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**H: I and II only.**
