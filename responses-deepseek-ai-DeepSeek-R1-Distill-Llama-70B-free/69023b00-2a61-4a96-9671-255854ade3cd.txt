Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the Earth's early atmosphere. The question is asking which gas was not abundant during the time when life is believed to have begun. The options are A through J, each a different gas.

Hmm, I remember that the early Earth's atmosphere was very different from today. I think it didn't have much oxygen because oxygen came later, produced by photosynthesis. So maybe F is the answer? But wait, the question is about which gas was not abundant. Let me think through each option.

Option A: Hydrogen. I think hydrogen was present, maybe as part of other compounds. Early atmospheres might have had hydrogen, especially since the solar wind brings a lot of it, but I'm not too sure.

Option B: Methane. Yes, I remember methane being a major component. It's a potent greenhouse gas and probably abundant in the early atmosphere. So this wasn't the exception.

Option C: Nitrogen. Wait, isn't nitrogen a major part of today's atmosphere? But I thought that early on, the atmosphere was more CO2 and other gases, with less N2. Or maybe not? Some sources say that nitrogen was present but maybe not as dominant as it is now. Or perhaps it was part of the atmosphere but in different forms.

Option D: Sulfur dioxide. SO2 is more associated with volcanic activity. Early Earth had a lot of volcanoes, so maybe it was present. But in abundance? I'm not certain.

Option E: Neon. Neon is a noble gas, so it's present but in very small amounts. So maybe neon wasn't abundant. But this is a trick option because noble gases are rare, so maybe E is the correct answer.

Option F: Oxygen. As I thought earlier, oxygen was scarce because it's a product of life. So F is definitely not abundant and might be the answer.

Option G: Helium. Helium is another noble gas. It's present but in small quantities. So like neon, it's not abundant.

Option H: Argon. Also a noble gas. Again, not abundant compared to other gases.

Option I: Ammonia. NH3. I think ammonia was present, maybe in the early atmosphere because it's a reducing environment. So it would have been around, making it not the exception.

Option J: Carbon dioxide. CO2 was definitely a major component, especially in the early atmosphere. So J is present.

Wait, the question is which was NOT abundant. So looking for a gas that was scarce.

Oxygen (F) is the big one because it's a product of photosynthesis, which came later with life. So during the period when life began, O2 was low. That makes F the exception.

But wait, looking back at the options, the question says "abundant amounts of all the following gases EXCEPT". So which one wasn't abundant.

So, F is oxygen and it's the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the early atmosphere composition. I remember that the early atmosphere had mostly CO2, N2 maybe, methane, ammonia, and water vapor. But oxygen was low.

So the exception is oxygen. So the correct answer is F.

During the period when life is believed to have begun, the Earth's atmosphere was very different from today. It was primarily composed of gases such as methane (B), ammonia (I), carbon dioxide (J), and possibly hydrogen (A). Noble gases like helium (G), neon (E), and argon (H) were present but in small amounts. Nitrogen (C) was also present, though it may not have been as dominant as it is today. Sulfur dioxide (D) could have been present due to volcanic activity. However, oxygen (F) was notably absent in significant amounts because it was primarily produced later through photosynthesis by early life forms. Therefore, the gas that was not abundant during this time was oxygen.

Answer: F
