Okay, so I've got this question about personnel selection and the term "adverse impact." Hmm, I remember from my studies that adverse impact has something to do with discrimination in hiring practices, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact definition. Let me think through this.

The question is asking what "adverse impact" means in the context of personnel selection. The options are A through J. Let me try to recall. Adverse impact refers to a situation where a hiring practice or selection process disproportionately affects a protected group. Like, if a certain test or requirement causes a lower hiring rate for a particular group covered by anti-discrimination laws.

I think it's about the hiring rate being lower than a certain threshold for protected groups. Oh right, there's something called the 80% rule or the four-fifths rule. If a protected group is hired at a rate less than 80% of the most successful group, that's considered adverse impact. So for example, if white applicants are hired at 100% and black applicants at 70%, that's a problem because 70 is less than 80% of 100. Wait, no, actually, the rule is that if the hiring rate for a protected group is less than 80% of the rate for the majority group, then it's adverse impact.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one states this. Let's go through the options one by one.

Option A: The total selection process results in equal results for all groups. That doesn't sound right because adverse impact is about unequal results.

Option B: A group covered by law is hired at >80% of the best group. So if the best has 100%, 80% is the cutoff. So B says more than 80. That's not adverse impact; it's the opposite.

Option C: Adverse conditions exist for selection of covered groups. That's vague and doesn't quantify anything, so probably not the right answer.

Option D: A non-covered group is hired higher. Not relevant because adverse impact is about protected groups.

Option E: A covered group is hired at <80% of the best. Yes, that fits what I was thinking about the four-fifths rule.

Option F: Non-covered group at <80%. Again, not relevant. Adverse impact is about protected groups.

Option G: Unequal results for covered groups. That's true but doesn't specify the 80% part. It's more general.

Option H: Interviews are adverse, causing differential rates. Maybe, but it's more about the process causing it, not the specific rate.

Option I: Adverse conditions for non-covered. Doesn't fit.

Option J: Interviews favorable but cause differential rates. Doesn't seem right.

So, the correct answer should be E. Because it's specifically about a protected group being hired at less than 80% of the best group's rate.

The term "adverse impact" in personnel selection refers to a situation where a hiring practice or selection process disproportionately affects a protected group, typically when the hiring rate for such a group is less than 80% of the rate for the most successful group. This is often referred to as the "four-fifths rule." Among the options provided, the one that accurately reflects this definition is:

E: a group covered by law is hired at a rate less than 80% of that of the group with the best selection.

Answer: E
