Okay, so I need to figure out how much Mr. Williams will have in his savings account after 3 months with the monthly deposits and the interest. Let me start by breaking down the problem.

First, Mr. Williams has $20 deducted each month and deposited into his savings. So over 3 months, that's 3 deposits of $20 each. Let me calculate that: 20 * 3 = $60. So without any interest, he'd have $60 after 3 months.

But wait, the savings account earns interest. The interest rate is given as 5 3/4 percent. Hmm, I should convert that mixed number to a decimal for calculations. 5 3/4 percent is the same as 5.75%, right? Because 3/4 is 0.75. So the annual interest rate is 5.75%.

Now, I'm a bit confused about how the interest is calculated. Is it simple interest or compound interest? The problem doesn't specify, but usually, savings accounts compound interest, maybe monthly or annually. But since the deposits are monthly and we're looking at just 3 months, maybe it's simpler.

Wait, the question is asking about the total added to his account in 3 months. So that includes the principal (the deposited money) plus the interest earned. But I think I need to calculate the interest on each deposit separately because each deposit is made at a different time.

Let me think: the first $20 is deposited at the beginning of the first month and earns interest for the full 3 months. The second deposit is made at the end of the first month, so it's in the account for 2 months. The third deposit is made at the end of the second month, so it's in the account for 1 month.

Wait, but how is the interest applied? Is it compounded monthly or is it simple interest? If it's simple interest, then each deposit earns interest based on the time it's in the account. If it's compounded, the interest is added each month, which might slightly change the calculation.

But since the time period is only 3 months, maybe it's easier to treat each deposit's interest separately and sum them up.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the interest for each $20 deposit based on how many months it stays in the account.
2. Sum the interests and add to the total deposits.

The interest rate is 5.75% per annum, which is 5.75/100 = 0.0575. To find the monthly interest rate, I divide by 12: 0.0575 / 12 ≈ 0.0047917 per month.

Now, for each deposit:

First deposit: $20 at month 0, stays for 3 months. So interest = 20 * (0.0575/12) * 3.

Wait, no, because each month it's getting compounded. Alternatively, for each month, the amount earns that month's interest.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to calculate each deposit's future value.

The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), but since the interest is compounded monthly and each deposit is a separate principal, I can compute each one.

Wait, but if the interest is compounded monthly, each deposit will start earning interest the next month.

Wait, alternative approach: Each $20 is added at different times and earns interest for the remaining period.

So:

Deposit 1: Made at the start of month 1. It earns interest for 3 months.

Deposit 2: Made at the end of month 1, so earns interest for 2 months.

Deposit 3: Made at the end of month 2, earns interest for 1 month.

Wait, but how is the interest calculated? For each deposit, the time in months is as follows.

So for each deposit:

Interest = Principal * rate * time.

But since the rate is annual, I need to adjust it to a monthly rate.

Wait, the annual rate is 5.75%, so the monthly rate would be 5.75% / 12 = approximately 0.47917% per month.

So for each deposit:

First deposit: $20 * 0.0575/12 * 3 months.

Second deposit: $20 * 0.0575/12 * 2 months.

Third deposit: $20 * 0.0575/12 * 1 month.

So let's compute each.

First: 20 * (0.0575/12) *3 = 20 * (0.0047917) *3 ≈ 20 * 0.014375 ≈ 0.2875.

Second: 20 * 0.0047917 * 2 ≈ 20 * 0.0095833 ≈ 0.191666.

Third: 20 * 0.0047917 * 1 ≈ 0.095834.

Adding these up: 0.2875 + 0.191666 + 0.095834 ≈ 0.575.

So total interest is approximately $0.575.

Wait, but that seems low. Because $60 in 3 months at 5.75% annually.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of future value for each deposit.

Another approach: The future value of each deposit after 3 months.

Deposit 1: At time 0, amount 20, for 3 months.

FV1 = 20 * (1 + (0.0575/12))^3.

Deposit 2: At time 1, so it's present for 2 months.

FV2 = 20 * (1 + 0.0575/12)^2.

Deposit 3: At time 2, present for 1 month.

FV3 = 20 * (1 + 0.0575/12)^1.

Then sum all FVs.

Let me compute each:

First, calculate the monthly rate: 0.0575/12 ≈ 0.0047916667.

FV1: 20 * (1.0047916667)^3.

Let me compute (1.0047916667)^3.

1.0047916667^1 = 1.0047916667

^2 = 1.0047916667 * 1.0047916667 ≈ let's compute:

1.0047916667 * 1.0047916667 = approx 1.009600 (exactly, 1.00479167^2 = (1 + 0.00479167)^2 ≈ 1 + 2*0.00479167 + (0.00479167)^2 ≈ 1.0095833 + 0.0000229 ≈ 1.0096062.

Then ^3 is 1.0096062 * 1.00479167 ≈ approx 1.014420.

So FV1 ≈ 20 * 1.014420 ≈ 20.2884.

FV2: 20 * (1.00479167)^2 ≈ 20 * 1.009606 ≈ 20.1921.

FV3: 20 * 1.00479167 ≈ 20.0958.

Now sum all three: 20.2884 + 20.1921 + 20.0958 ≈ 60.5763.

So the total amount after 3 months is approximately $60.5763.

Wait, but the principal was $60, so the interest is $0.5763. That's about 57.63 cents in interest.

Looking at the options, the closest one is D: $60.76, but that's higher than our calculation. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Alternatively, maybe the interest is simple interest on the total amount. Let's see.

If all $60 were deposited at once, the interest would be 60 * (0.0575) * (3/12) = 60 * 0.0575 * 0.25 = 60 * 0.014375 = $0.8675. So total amount would be 60.8675, which is about $60.87. But that's not matching any of the options either.

Wait, perhaps the interest is compounded quarterly or annually, but since the time is 3 months, which is a quarter, maybe the interest is simple interest for the quarter.

Alternatively, perhaps the interest rate is 5 3/4%, which is 5.75%, and the interest is calculated as simple interest on each deposit.

Wait, perhaps it's not compounded and each deposit earns simple interest for their respective periods.

So for each deposit:

First deposit: 20 * 0.0575 * (3/12) = 20 * 0.0575 * 0.25 = 20 * 0.014375 = 0.2875.

Second deposit: 20 * 0.0575 * (2/12) = 20 * 0.0575 * (1/6) ≈ 20 * 0.0095833 ≈ 0.191666.

Third deposit: 20 * 0.0575 * (1/12) ≈ 20 * 0.0047916 ≈ 0.095834.

Total interest: 0.2875 + 0.191666 + 0.095834 ≈ 0.575.

So total amount is 60 + 0.575 = $60.575, which is about $60.58. Looking at the options, none match exactly. The closest is option H: $60.56, but wait, let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are:

D: $60.76

E: $60.25

H: $60.56

Hmm, our calculation is approximately $60.575, which would round to $60.58, but the options don't have that. H is $60.56, which is slightly lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute the interest again.

Alternatively, maybe the interest is compounded monthly, so each month's deposit earns interest each subsequent month.

Wait, perhaps I should compute each deposit's interest step by step.

Let me try a different approach. Let's model each month.

Month 1:

Deposit $20. The balance is $20. Interest for the first month: 20 * (5.75%/12) = 20 * 0.0047916667 ≈ $0.09583. So balance becomes 20 + 0.09583 ≈ $20.09583.

Month 2:

Deposit another $20. Now, before interest, the balance is 20.09583 + 20 = $40.09583.

Interest for month 2: 40.09583 * 0.0047916667 ≈ let's compute 40 * 0.0047916667 ≈ 0.1916667, but more accurately: 40.09583 * 0.0047916667 ≈ 0.1925 (exact calculation: 40.09583 * 0.0047916667 ≈ 0.1925 approx).

So balance after interest: 40.09583 + 0.1925 ≈ $40.2883.

Month 3:

Deposit another $20. Balance before interest: 40.2883 + 20 = $60.2883.

Interest for month 3: 60.2883 * 0.0047916667 ≈ 60 * 0.0047916667 is 0.2875, plus 0.2883 * 0.00479 ≈ approx 0.00138. So total interest ≈ 0.2875 + 0.00138 ≈ 0.28888.

So balance after interest: 60.2883 + 0.28888 ≈ $60.5772.

So total after 3 months is approximately $60.58. But looking at the options, the closest is H: $60.56 and D: $60.76.

Wait, but in this approach, the total is around $60.58, which isn't exactly one of the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should carry more decimal places in the calculations.

Let me recalculate the interest each month more precisely.

Month 1:

Deposit $20. Interest = 20 * (0.0575/12) = 20 * 0.0047916667 = 0.0958333.

Balance after month 1: 20 + 0.0958333 = 20.0958333.

Month 2:

Deposit $20. Balance before interest: 20.0958333 + 20 = 40.0958333.

Interest: 40.0958333 * 0.0047916667.

Compute 40.0958333 * 0.0047916667:

40 * 0.0047916667 = 0.191666668.

0.0958333 * 0.0047916667 ≈ 0.00045932.

So total interest ≈ 0.191666668 + 0.00045932 ≈ 0.192125988.

Balance after interest: 40.0958333 + 0.192125988 ≈ 40.2879593.

Month 3:

Deposit $20. Balance before interest: 40.2879593 + 20 = 60.2879593.

Interest: 60.2879593 * 0.0047916667.

Compute 60 * 0.0047916667 = 0.2875.

0.2879593 * 0.0047916667 ≈ approx 0.001382.

So total interest ≈ 0.2875 + 0.001382 ≈ 0.288882.

Balance after interest: 60.2879593 + 0.288882 ≈ 60.5768413.

So approximately $60.5768, which is $60.58 when rounded to the nearest cent. But none of the options exactly match this. Wait, looking back at the options, option D is $60.76, which is higher, and H is $60.56, which is lower.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Alternatively, perhaps the interest is calculated using simple interest on the average balance or something else.

Wait, another possibility: The interest is calculated on the initial principal only, without compounding, which would be simple interest on each deposit.

Each deposit is $20, so:

Deposit 1: earns interest for 3 months.

Interest = 20 * (5.75%) * (3/12) = 20 * 0.0575 * 0.25 = 20 * 0.014375 = $0.2875.

Deposit 2: earns interest for 2 months.

Interest = 20 * 0.0575 * (2/12) = 20 * 0.0575 * (1/6) ≈ 20 * 0.0095833 ≈ $0.191666.

Deposit 3: earns for 1 month.

Interest = 20 * 0.0575 * (1/12) ≈ 20 * 0.0047916 ≈ $0.095834.

Total interest: 0.2875 + 0.191666 + 0.095834 ≈ 0.575.

Total amount: 60 + 0.575 = $60.575. So $60.58.

But the options don't have this exact amount. The closest is H: $60.56 and D: $60.76.

Wait, perhaps the interest is compounded annually instead of monthly. Let me try that.

If the interest is compounded annually, but the time is 3 months, which is a quarter of a year, then the effective rate for 3 months would be 5.75% / 4 = 1.4375% per quarter.

But that doesn't quite make sense because compounding annually would mean interest is added once per year. So in this case, since the deposits are made monthly and we're looking at only 3 months, the interest wouldn't have been compounded yet. So perhaps each deposit earns simple interest for their respective periods.

Wait, maybe the interest is calculated as 5.75% per annum, but applied on a monthly basis without compounding. So each deposit earns interest each month based on the monthly rate.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me approach it another way.

The total deposits over 3 months are $60.

The interest rate is 5.75% per year. So the interest for 3 months would be (5.75% / 4) = 1.4375% on the average balance or something. But I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: The total amount deposited is $60. If the interest is simple interest, then the interest would be 60 * (5.75%) * (3/12) = 60 * 0.0575 * 0.25 = 60 * 0.014375 = $0.8675. So total amount would be 60 + 0.8675 = $60.8675, which is about $60.87, but that's not an option either.

Hmm. The options don't include $60.58 or $60.87, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement: It says the interest is declared at 5 3/4%. It doesn't specify compounding, so perhaps it's simple interest on each deposit.

Wait, but earlier I calculated that the total interest using simple interest per deposit was $0.575, giving a total of $60.575.

Looking at the options, the closest is H: $60.56.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck the simple interest approach.

Deposit 1: 3 months.

Interest = 20 * (5.75/100) * (3/12) = 20 * 0.0575 * 0.25 = 20 * 0.014375 = 0.2875.

Deposit 2: 2 months.

Interest = 20 * 0.0575 * (2/12) = 20 * 0.0575 * 0.1666667 ≈ 20 * 0.0095833 = 0.191666.

Deposit 3: 1 month.

Interest = 20 * 0.0575 * (1/12) ≈ 20 * 0.0047916 ≈ 0.095834.

Total interest: 0.2875 + 0.191666 + 0.095834 = 0.575.

Total amount: 60 + 0.575 = 60.575, which is $60.58.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the question assumes that the interest is compounded monthly, and the total is about $60.58, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, maybe the interest is calculated on the total amount at the end of 3 months.

Wait, perhaps it's using the future value formula for the total sum.

Alternatively, maybe the total amount is $60, and the interest is calculated on that.

Wait, but that's not correct because each deposit is made at different times.

Alternatively
