Question:

Which statement about intestinal "brakes" and "accelerators" is FALSE?


Options:

A: Short-chain fatty acids which move from colon to caecum (reflux) promote ileo-caecal motility
B: The arrival of fiber in the colon causes an increase in motility and a switch from the "fasting" to the "feeding" pattern.
C: The arrival of lipid in the duodenum causes an immediate reduction in motility and a switch from the "fasting" to the "feeding" pattern.
D: Food in the stomach causes gastrin release, which stimulates acid secretion
E: Protein ingestion leads to immediate increase in intestinal motility
F: Gastric acid secretion inhibits small intestinal motility
G: The presence of bile in the intestine slows down motility
H: The presence of undigested food in the colon stimulates intestinal motility
I: Dietary starch is a potent stimulator of small intestinal motility because it causes insulin release from the pancreas
J: The presence of glucose in the duodenum accelerates intestinal motility

Okay, so I've got this question about intestinal brakes and accelerators. Hmm, I remember from my physiology class that the gut has these mechanisms to control the movement of food through the digestive system. The brakes slow things down, and the accelerators speed things up, right?

The question is asking which statement is false. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: Short-chain fatty acids moving from colon to caecum promote ileo-caecal motility. Wait, I think short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are produced in the colon by fermentation. They can stimulate motility, but I'm not sure about the direction. Do they go from colon to caecum? The caecum is the start of the large intestine, so reflux would mean moving backward. I'm not certain about this one yet.

Option B: Fiber in the colon increases motility and switches to feeding pattern. Fiber is fermented by bacteria, which produces SCFAs. This usually would increase motility, so this sounds correct. Also, switching from fasting (which is migrating motor complex) to feeding (more continuous contractions) makes sense when food is present. So B seems true.

Option C: Lipid in duodenum reduces motility and switches to feeding pattern. Wait, when fat enters the small intestine, it releases hormones like CCK, which slows gastric emptying. This is the ileal brake, right? It also would decrease motility in the small intestine to allow more time for digestion. So C says the arrival causes immediate reduction in motility and switches to feeding. Wait, the fasting pattern is the migrating motor complex, which happens when you're not eating. When you eat, the pattern becomes more continuous, so it's a feeding pattern. So C seems correct.

Option D: Food in stomach causes gastrin release, which stimulates acid. Yes, I remember that gastrin release is triggered by food entering the stomach, especially proteins. Gastrin then stimulates parietal cells to secrete acid. So D is true.

Option E: Protein ingestion increases motility immediately. I think protein does stimulate motility. Maybe through hormones or neural mechanisms. So E seems correct.

Option F: Gastric acid inhibits small intestinal motility. Wait, when the stomach is empty, the small intestine has the fasting motility (MMC). When food enters, including acid, it should switch to the fed pattern. Gastric acid in the small intestine would probably slow things down because the intestine doesn't want to move too quickly. So F says it inhibits motility, which sounds correct. Wait, not sure. Or does it actually cause the intestine to contract more? I'm a bit confused here.

Option G: Bile in the intestine slows motility. Bile is released into the small intestine during digestion. I think it's more about emulsifying fats, but does it affect motility? Maybe, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, I remember that the presence of certain substances in the duodenum, like acid or fat, slows down the stomach (via enterogastric reflex) but what about motility in the small intestine itself? Or maybe it's about the ileal brake. Hmm. Not sure about G yet.

Option H: Undigested food in the colon stimulates motility. Yes, the presence of undigested material in the colon, like fiber, usually leads to increased motility to move it along. So H is correct.

Option I: Dietary starch stimulates small intestinal motility via insulin. Wait, insulin is released when blood glucose rises, like after a meal. But how does that relate to motility? I'm not sure if dietary starch directly causes insulin release which then affects motility. Alternatively, maybe it's more about the digestion of starch into glucose, which then triggers hormones. Or perhaps it's not about insulin but other hormones like CCK or GIP. Hmm, this might be the false one. Because I don't recall insulin being a primary stimulator of intestinal motility. 

Option J: Glucose in duodenum accelerates motility. Glucose presence would likely trigger hormonal responses that could influence motility. I think glucose can increase motility because it's a sign that nutrients are present, so the gut should be active. So J seems correct.

So, going back to the options. The question is which statement is false.

Looking at option I again: Dietary starch is a potent stimulator because it causes insulin release. Wait, dietary starch is broken down into glucose in the small intestine. The presence of glucose would lead to insulin secretion. But does starch itself cause insulin release directly? Or is it the rise in blood glucose? I think starch digestion leads to glucose absorption, which triggers insulin. But does that insulin then stimulate motility? Or is it other hormones like GIP (which also stimulates insulin) that affect motility. Or maybe some other mechanism.

Alternatively, perhaps dietary starch directly causes the release of hormones that stimulate motility, not via insulin. For example, carbohydrates can release GIP, which in turn could influence motility. So if option I says it's because of insulin, that might be incorrect. Because maybe the motility is stimulated by the presence of nutrients, not directly by insulin.

So option I's reasoning might be false. Or perhaps it's the other way around. Another point: insulin is more about glucose uptake and metabolism, not directly about motility. So statement I is false because dietary starch increases motility through other mechanisms, not because of insulin release.

To determine which statement about intestinal "brakes" and "accelerators" is false, each option was analyzed as follows:

- **Option A**: Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are produced in the colon and can stimulate motility. However, the statement specifies that SCFAs move from the colon to the caecum (reflux) to promote ileo-caecal motility. This is questionable, as SCFAs typically act locally in the colon rather than refluxing to the caecum. This option may be incorrect but requires further verification.

- **Option B**: Fiber in the colon increases motility and switches from the fasting to the feeding pattern. This is accurate, as fiber fermentation produces SCFAs, which stimulate motility and transition the gut to a feeding pattern.

- **Option C**: Lipid in the duodenum reduces motility and switches to the feeding pattern. This is correct, as fat entering the duodenum triggers the release of hormones like cholecystokinin (CCK), which slows motility and transitions to a feeding pattern.

- **Option D**: Food in the stomach causes gastrin release, which stimulates acid secretion. This is true, as gastrin is a key stimulant for gastric acid secretion.

- **Option E**: Protein ingestion leads to an immediate increase in intestinal motility. This is correct, as protein stimulates motility through neural and hormonal mechanisms.

- **Option F**: Gastric acid secretion inhibits small intestinal motility. This is accurate, as gastric acid in the small intestine slows motility to allow time for digestion.

- **Option G**: The presence of bile in the intestine slows down motility. This is likely true, as bile can influence motility, particularly in the context of the ileal brake.

- **Option H**: Undigested food in the colon stimulates intestinal motility. This is correct, as undigested material in the colon promotes motility to move it along.

- **Option I**: Dietary starch is a potent stimulator of small intestinal motility because it causes insulin release from the pancreas. This is false. While dietary starch is broken down into glucose, which can stimulate insulin release, insulin itself is not a primary stimulator of intestinal motility. Motility is more directly influenced by the presence of nutrients or hormones like GIP, rather than insulin.

- **Option J**: The presence of glucose in the duodenum accelerates intestinal motility. This is true, as glucose in the duodenum triggers hormonal responses that increase motility.

The false statement is **Option I**, as dietary starch stimulates motility through mechanisms other than insulin release.
