Question:

Two years ago, a developer conveyed title to a lot to a woman by warranty deed. The woman purchased an owner's policy of title insurance before the an owner's policy of title insurance before the closing. Because of an error by the title insurance company, the title commitment and title policy failed to list a county tax lien encumbering the lot as an exception to coverage. Last year, the woman conveyed the lot for a bargain price by a quitclaim deed to a friend, who paid cash, did not conduct a title search, and did not purchase title insurance. Subsequently, the county began proceedings to foreclose the tax lien, and the friend filed a claim with the woman's title insurance company, demanding that the company reimburse her for the tax lien amount. Is the title insurance company obligated to pay the friend's claim?

Options:

A: No, because the friend did not conduct a title search before purchasing the lot.
B: No, because the friend did not purchase her own title insurance.
C: No, because the title insurance policy expired when the woman conveyed the lot to the friend.
D: Yes, because the tax lien was not listed as an exception on the title insurance policy.
E: No, because the woman no longer owns the property, and thus her title insurance is no longer valid.
F: Yes, because the woman used a quitclaim deed, which means all encumbrances should transfer to the new owner.
G: No, because the friend is not a named insured on the title insurance policy.
H: Yes, because the friend paid cash, making her eligible for claims.
I: Yes, because the woman is liable to the friend for breach of the covenant against encumbrances, and the title policy should cover the friend's potential loss.
J: Yes, because the title insurance company made an error in not listing the tax lien.

Okay, so I have this question about title insurance, and I need to figure it out. Let's try to break it down.

So, two years ago, a developer sold a lot to a woman using a warranty deed. She bought an owner's title insurance policy before closing. But the title company made a mistake and didn't list a county tax lien as an exception. So, the policy didn't cover that lien.

Then, last year, the woman sold the lot to her friend using a quitclaim deed for a bargain price. The friend paid cash, didn't do a title search, and didn't buy her own title insurance. Now, the county is trying to foreclose because of the tax lien, and the friend is asking the title insurance company to reimburse her for the lien amount.

The question is whether the title insurance company is obligated to pay the friend's claim.

First, I remember that title insurance policies are usually for the owner and their heirs or assigns. So, when the woman bought the policy, it might cover her as the owner, but what happens when she sells it?

Wait, the woman used a quitclaim deed. I think a quitclaim conveys whatever interest the grantor has, but doesn't make any warranties. So the friend gets whatever title the woman had, including any encumbrances.

But the key point is about the title insurance. The policy was in the woman's name. When she sells, does the coverage transfer to the friend? Or does it stay with the woman?

I think that owner's title insurance typically covers the owner during their ownership but doesn't automatically transfer to a new owner. So when the woman conveyed the property, her policy would not cover the friend unless there's an assignment or the policy allows it. But I don't think that's the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the friend could have some claim because she's the successor, but I'm not sure. Wait, some policies might have provisions that the coverage continues for successors, but I think that's more the case with lender's policies. Owner's policies generally protect the specific insured, not subsequent owners unless it's specified.

Looking at the options:

Option G says no because the friend isn't a named insured. That makes sense because the policy was issued to the woman. Unless the policy somehow covers grantees, but I don't think so.

Option D says yes because the tax lien wasn't listed as an exception. But that would apply if the insured (woman) had a claim, not the friend.

Option I says yes because the woman is liable for breach of covenant against encumbrances and the policy covers the friend's loss. Wait, the woman gave a quitclaim deed, which doesn't have any covenants, so she didn't breach any. So the friend can't claim against the woman for breach of covenants because there were none. So option I might not be correct.

Option E says no because the woman no longer owns the property. But the policy was for her when she owned it. If she's not the owner anymore, can she make a claim? Or does her policy terminate upon sale?

Wait, the policy insures the title as of the time she bought it. If she sells, her policy doesn't cover future events, but it covers her for losses during her ownership. But if the tax lien was already there when she bought it, and the policy didn't exclude it, then the company would have been liable to her if she had a loss. But she sold the property, so any loss would be the friend's, not hers.

So the friend isn't covered under the woman's policy because she's not the insured. So the insurance company isn't obligated to pay the friend.

Looking again at the options, the possible answers are B, C, E, G.

Option B: No because the friend didn't buy insurance. But that's not necessarily the reason. The friend might have a claim if she's covered under the woman's policy.

Option G: No because she's not a named insured. That seems correct because the policy is in the woman's name.

So the answer should be G.

Wait but wait! I remember that sometimes, when you sell property, the title insurance might have a provision that allows the coverage to continue for the new owner, but I think that's only if the policy is assigned or if it's specifically for the benefit of successors. I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the policy's coverage is for the benefit of anyone who takes title, but I don't think so. Owner's policies are usually for the named insured only.

So I think the answer is G.

The question revolves around whether the title insurance company is obligated to pay the friend's claim for a tax lien that was not listed as an exception on the woman's title insurance policy. The key issue is whether the friend, as the new owner, is covered under the woman's policy.

Title insurance policies are typically issued to protect the named insured (in this case, the woman) during their ownership of the property. When the woman conveyed the lot to the friend via a quitclaim deed, the policy did not automatically transfer to the friend unless the policy explicitly allowed for such a transfer, which is not indicated here. The friend, as a subsequent owner, is not a named insured under the woman's policy and therefore is not covered by it.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option G** correctly states that the friend is not a named insured on the title insurance policy, making the company not obligated to pay her claim. This aligns with the general principle that title insurance policies protect only the named insured unless explicitly extended to successors or assigns.

- Other options, such as **Option D**, focus on the tax lien not being listed as an exception, but this would only apply if the woman herself had a claim, not the friend. Similarly, **Option I** is incorrect because the woman used a quitclaim deed, which does not include covenants against encumbrances, so she cannot be held liable for the tax lien.

Thus, the correct answer is based on the fact that the friend is not a named insured under the policy.

**Answer: G**
