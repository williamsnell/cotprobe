Okay, so I've got this question about philosophy, specifically related to Peter Singer's views on the principle of equal consideration of interests. The question is asking which historical defender of this principle recognized that it applies to other species, not just humans. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that Peter Singer is a contemporary philosopher known for his work in ethics, particularly in animal rights. His book "Animal Liberation" is a key text here. Singer argues that the principle of equal consideration of interests should extend beyond humans to non-human animals. So the question is about who else, historically, shared this view.

The options are A through J, with various philosophers listed. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: Aristotle. I know Aristotle believed in a hierarchy of beings, with humans at the top. He didn't think animals had the same kind of souls as humans, so I don't think he supported equal consideration for other species.

Option B: Friedrich Nietzsche. Nietzsche was more about the will to power and individualism. I don't recall him focusing on animal rights or equal consideration in that way. Probably not him.

Option C: David Hume. Hume was an empiricist and did write about animals, recognizing them as sentient. He discussed animals in the context of ethics, so maybe he's a contender. But did he specifically argue for equal consideration across species?

Option D: Jeremy Bentham. Bentham is the founder of utilitarianism, which is about maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain. He's famous for saying that the question isn't whether animals can reason or talk, but whether they can suffer. So Bentham definitely considered animal interests, but the question is about the principle of equal consideration. I think Bentham's approach was more about including animals in the utilitarian calculation, but I'm not sure if he explicitly stated that their interests should be given equal consideration as humans.

Option E: John Stuart Mill. Mill was also a utilitarian, following Bentham. He expanded on Bentham's ideas, but I'm not sure if he extended the principle to animals. Mill's focus was more on human rights and individual liberties, so maybe not.

Option F: Thomas Hobbes. Hobbes was a social contract theorist who saw life as "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short." He didn't really address animal rights much, I think. His focus was on human society and the state.

Option G: Immanuel Kant. Kant believed in treating individuals as ends in themselves, but he mostly applied this to humans. He didn't think animals had moral rights in the same way, so probably not him.

Option H: Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Rousseau wrote about the social contract too and the general will. I don't recall him addressing animal rights specifically, especially in terms of equal consideration.

Option I: Socrates. Socrates is from ancient times, and his philosophy, as recorded by Plato, didn't really touch on animal rights. He was more concerned with human ethics and knowledge.

Option J: Rene Descartes. Descartes is infamous for his view that animals are machines without souls, so he wouldn't support considering their interests equally.

So, narrowing it down, the main contenders are Hume and Bentham. Singer often mentions Bentham in the context of animal rights. But the question is about the principle of equal consideration of interests. I think Hume might have discussed the moral consideration of animals, but the equal part is key.

Wait, in Singer's work, he credits Bentham with recognizing that sentience is what matters, not species. But does that mean equal consideration? Or just consideration?

Wait, the principle of equal consideration of interests, as per Singer, means that the interests of all beings are counted equally, not just humans. So who among the historical philosophers applied this principle beyond humans?

I think Jeremy Bentham is the one who is often cited as an early advocate for considering animals in moral calculations, though perhaps not exactly equal consideration. But in the context of the question, among the options given, Bentham might be the intended answer.

Alternatively, I recall that in "Animal Liberation," Singer discusses how few philosophers have taken animal interests seriously. He mentions that Bentham was one of the first to argue that animals' suffering should be considered, but perhaps not in the same way as humans.

Wait, but the question is about the principle of equal consideration applying to other species. So the defender would have to say that the interests of non-humans should be given equal weight.

Wait, another thought: John Stuart Mill expanded on Bentham's utilitarianism but focused more on human well-being. So perhaps not him.

Hume, on the other hand, in his "Treatise on Human Nature," discusses the treatment of animals and suggests that humans and animals share many qualities. He might have argued that their interests should be considered, but I'm not sure if he said they should be equal.

Wait, here's a point: Singer's principle is about equal consideration, not necessarily equal treatment. So perhaps Bentham, by considering animals' suffering in the utilitarian calculus, was applying a form of equal consideration, even if he didn't explicitly state it as such.

Alternatively, another angle: the question says "one of the few to recognize that the principle applies to members of other species as well as our own." So it's about recognizing that the principle (which they already defended for humans) extends to animals.

Looking back, I think Jeremy Bentham is the right choice because he's the one who is famous for considering animal suffering in moral calculations, thus applying the principle beyond humans.

So the answer should be D: Jeremy Bentham.

The question asks which historical defender of the principle of equal consideration of interests recognized that it applies to members of other species as well as humans. To answer this, it is important to analyze the philosophers listed and their views on animal rights and moral consideration.

- **Aristotle**: Believed in a hierarchy of beings with humans at the top and did not support equal consideration for animals.  
- **Friedrich Nietzsche**: Focused on individualism and the will to power, not animal rights or equal consideration.  
- **David Hume**: Recognized animal sentience and discussed ethics in relation to animals but did not explicitly argue for equal consideration of interests.  
- **Jeremy Bentham**: As the founder of utilitarianism, he argued that the ability to suffer is what matters, not species. He is famous for extending moral consideration to animals, which aligns with the principle of equal consideration of interests.  
- **John Stuart Mill**: Expanded on Bentham's utilitarianism but focused more on human rights and individual liberties, not explicitly extending the principle to animals.  
- **Thomas Hobbes**: Focused on human society and the state, not animal rights.  
- **Immanuel Kant**: Believed in treating individuals as ends in themselves but applied this primarily to humans, not animals.  
- **Jean-Jacques Rousseau**: Did not address animal rights specifically.  
- **Socrates**: Focused on human ethics and knowledge, not animal rights.  
- **Rene Descartes**: Viewed animals as machines without souls, so he did not support equal consideration.  

Among the options, **Jeremy Bentham** is the most likely answer because he is credited with recognizing that the principle of moral consideration extends to non-human animals based on their capacity to suffer. While he may not have explicitly stated "equal consideration," his inclusion of animals in the utilitarian calculus aligns with the principle described in the question.

Answer: D
