Okay, so I've got this question here about converting tax rates from percentages to mills per dollar of assessed valuation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it.

First, I remember that mills are a unit used in property taxation. I think one mill is equal to one-tenth of a cent, but wait, no, wait. Oh right, one mill is 1/1000 of a dollar. So, 1 mill = $0.001. Wait, no, that's not right in terms of the rate. Wait, the tax rate expressed in mills is per dollar of assessed value. So, 1 mill would be 1/10 of a cent per dollar. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Let me think. If I have a tax rate of 1%, that means I pay 1 cent per dollar. So 1% equals how many mills? Since 1% is 0.01 dollars per dollar, which is 1 cent. And since a mill is 0.1 cents, right? Because 1 cent = 10 mills. So 1% is 100 mills. Oh wait, wait, no. Wait, 1% is 1/100, which is 0.01. If 1% equals 100 mills, then each mill is 0.01% (since 1% is 100 mills). Wait, no, no. Let's get this straight.

Wait, 1 mill equals 1/1000 of a dollar. So, per dollar of assessed value, 1 mill would be $0.001. So, if I have a tax rate of X%, I need to convert that percentage into mills.

So, let's take the first tax rate given: 3.06%. So, 3.06% as a decimal is 0.0306. That means for each dollar of assessed valuation, the tax is $0.0306. Now, since 1 mill is $0.001 per dollar, we need to find how many times 0.001 goes into 0.0306.

So, 0.0306 divided by 0.001 is 30.6. So, 3.06% is equal to 30.6 mills. Similarly, for 6.85%, that's 0.0685. Divided by 0.001, that gives 68.5. So, 6.85% equals 68.5 mills.

Now, looking at the options, which option matches this? Let's see:

Option A: 3.06% = 306, 6.85=685. No, that's way too high. So not A.

Option B: 3.06 is 36.6, 6.85 is 85.5. Hmm, that's 1/10th of what I calculated. So maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, wait. Did I get the conversion right? Because sometimes, especially in different regions, the terminology can be tricky. Maybe they're using a different base. Let me double-check.

Wait another approach: 1% = 10 mills. Because 1% is 0.01 dollars per dollar, and 1 mill is 0.001, so 0.01 /0.001=10. So, 1% is 10 mills. Oh wait, so if 1% is 10 mills, then 3.06% is 3.06 *10 = 30.6 mills. Similarly, 6.85% is 6.85 *10=68.5. So my initial calculation was correct. So the first tax rate is 30.6 and the second is 68.5.

Looking back at the options, option F says 3.06% is 30.6 and 6.85% is 68.5. So option F should be the correct one.

Wait, let me just make sure I didn't miscalculate when I thought about 1 mill being 1/10 of a cent. Oh, right, because 1 cent is 10 mills, so 0.01 dollars (1%) equals 10 mills. So yeah, everything checks out. So the correct answer is option F.

To convert tax rates from percentages to mills per dollar of assessed valuation, it is important to understand the relationship between percentages and mills. One mill is equivalent to 0.1% or $0.001 per dollar of assessed valuation. Therefore, to convert a percentage to mills, the percentage is multiplied by 10.

1. For the first tax rate, **3.06%**:  
   - Convert 3.06% to mills:  
     \[
     3.06 \times 10 = 30.6 \, \text{mills}.
     \]

2. For the second tax rate, **6.85%**:  
   - Convert 6.85% to mills:  
     \[
     6.85 \times 10 = 68.5 \, \text{mills}.
     \]

Now, comparing these results to the options provided:  
- **Option F** states that **3.06% = 30.6 mills per dollar** and **6.85% = 68.5 mills per dollar**, which matches the calculations above.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**F**
