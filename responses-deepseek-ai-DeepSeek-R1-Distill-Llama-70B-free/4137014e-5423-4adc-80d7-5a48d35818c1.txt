Okay, I've got this question about holography, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it. So the setup is that both the reference source and the object are 1 meter away from the hologram plate, and they're 100 mm apart. The wavelength is 632.8 nm, which I remember is the wavelength of a red He-Ne laser, commonly used in these experiments.

The question is asking about the scale of detail in the hologram fringes. Hmm, I think the scale of detail relates to the spacing between the interference fringes on the hologram plate. Oh right, in holography, the fringes are a result of the interference between the reference wave and the object wave. The spacing of these fringes determines the resolution of the hologram.

Wait, so what formula do I use here? I recall that the fringe spacing (delta) is given by delta = λ * d / L, where lambda is the wavelength, d is the distance between the reference and object sources, and L is the distance from the sources to the hologram plate. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think. Oh wait, no, I think I might have got it mixed up.

Wait, no, wait. The formula for the spacing between interference fringes is usually delta = λ * L / d, where L is the distance from the source to the screen. Oh, wait, but in this case, the sources are both at a distance L from the hologram plate, and they're separated by d. So the formula for the fringe spacing would be delta = (lambda * L) / (d), right?

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up Young's double slit with this. In Young's experiment, the fringe spacing is delta = (lambda * D)/a, where D is the distance to the screen, and a is the slit separation. So in this holography case, it's similar—two sources (like two slits), so the fringe spacing would depend on the separation between the sources and the distance to the plate.

So in this problem, L is 1 m (distance from sources to plate) and d is 100 mm, which is 0.1 m. The wavelength lambda is 632.8 nm, which is 632.8e-9 m.

Plugging into the formula delta = (lambda * L) / d. Let me compute that.

So lambda is 632.8e-9 m, L is 1 m, d is 0.1 m.

So delta = (632.8e-9 m * 1 m) / 0.1 m. Let me compute that: 632.8e-9 divided by 0.1 is 632.8e-8, which is 6.328e-6 meters. Wait, 6.328e-6 m is 6.33 micrometers. But looking at the options, option D is 6.33e-6 m. So the answer should be D.

Wait a second, but wait. Let me double-check. Oh wait, because in some sources, the formula is delta = (lambda * L)/d. But I'm not entirely sure if L is the right term here. Alternatively, some might model it as the sources being separated by 'd' and the distance from each to the plate being L. So the formula might be correct as I applied.

Alternatively, if the formula is delta = (lambda * (distance from source to plate)) / (separation between sources), which is what I used, then the calculation is correct.

Wait, but what if I mixed up the formula? Let me think about units. The units for delta would be meters. Lambda is in meters, L in meters, d in meters. So (m * m) / m = m, which is correct.

So (632.8e-9 m * 1 m) / 0.1 m = 632.8e-9 / 0.1 = 632.8e-8 = 6.328e-6 m, which is 6.33 micrometers. So option D is 6.33e-6 m. So the answer would be D.

I think that's correct. So I'll go with D.

To estimate the scale of detail in the hologram fringes, we use the formula for fringe spacing in holography:

\[
\delta = \frac{\lambda \cdot L}{d}
\]

where:
- \( \lambda = 632.8 \, \text{nm} = 632.8 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \) (wavelength of light),
- \( L = 1 \, \text{m} \) (distance from the sources to the hologram plate),
- \( d = 100 \, \text{mm} = 0.1 \, \text{m} \) (separation between the reference and object sources).

Substituting the values:

\[
\delta = \frac{(632.8 \times 10^{-9}) \cdot 1}{0.1} = \frac{632.8 \times 10^{-9}}{0.1} = 632.8 \times 10^{-8} = 6.328 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}
\]

This simplifies to approximately \( 6.33 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m} \), which matches option D. Therefore, the scale of detail in the hologram fringes is **6.33 × 10⁻⁶ m**.
