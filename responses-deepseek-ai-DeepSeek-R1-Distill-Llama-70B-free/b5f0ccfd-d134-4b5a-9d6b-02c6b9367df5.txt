Okay, I'm trying to figure out this bond interest expense question. Let's see, the bond was issued on June 1, year 1. The interest payment dates are April 1 and October 1. I need to find out the period for which the bond interest expense is calculated for the year ended December 31, year 1.

Hmm, wait a minute. The bond was issued in June, but the interest is paid on April 1 and October 1. So the company is paying interest twice a year. But wait, the first payment after June would be October 1, because April 1 is before June. So the first interest period after issuance is from June 1 to October 1.

Let me calculate how many months that is. From June 1 to October 1 is... June has 30 days, so from June 1 to June 30 is one month. Then July, August, September, and up to October 1. So that's four months (June, July, August, September) plus the first day of October? Wait, no, because the payment is made on October 1, so the period is up to but not including October 1. So from June 1 to October 1 is exactly four months. Wait, no: June 1 to July 1 is one month, July 1 to August 1 is two, August 1 to September 1 is three, September 1 to October 1 is four. So four months.

So the first interest payment is on October 1, which would cover the period from June 1 to October 1. Then the next payment would be April 1 of the next year, but that's in year 2. So for year 1, the interest expense would cover from June 1 to October 1, which is four months. Then, from October 1 to December 31, that's another period. Wait, does the interest accrue from October 1 to December 31?

Wait, no. Because the next payment after October 1 is April 1. So the period after October 1 (year 1) would be up to December 31, which is the end of the year. Let me count the months. October has 31 days, so October 1 to November 1 is one month, November 1 to December 1 is another, and December 1 to December 31 is another partial month. Wait, but in terms of months counted as whole periods, I think we just count full months between the payment dates.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the coupon payments. The bond pays interest on April 1 and October 1 each year. So for year 1, the company will have two payment periods: the first from the issue date (June 1) to the first payment date (October 1), and then from October 1 to the next payment date (April 1 of next year). But since the financial year ends on December 31, the period after October 1 is only up to December 31, not the full six months until April 1.

Wait, but wait. For the first period, the bond was issued on June 1, so the first coupon is paid on October 1. The period from June 1 to October 1 is four months. Then, after October 1, the next coupon is April 1 of year 2. So for the year ended December 31, year 1, the company would have two interest periods: four months (June 1 to October 1) and then from October 1 to December 31, which is three months (October, November, December). Wait, no: October 1 to December 31 is three months? Let me count: October has 31 days, so October is a full month, November is a full month, and December is up to the 31st. So that's three full months.

Wait but the payment dates are April 1 and October 1. So the periods are April 1 to October 1 (6 months) and October 1 to April 1 (another 6 months). But the bond was issued on June 1, so for the first period, it's from June 1 to October 1, which is four months. Then from October 1 to the next April 1, but since the year ends on December 31, you only have from October 1 to December 31, which is three months. So the total interest expense for the year would be the sum of these two periods: four months + three months = seven months.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. The bond is issued on June 1, and the first interest payment is on October 1. So the period from June 1 to October 1 is four months. Then, from October 1 to the next payment on April 1 is six months, but since the year ends on December 31, only three months (October, November, December) are within year 1. So the total time for interest accrual in year 1 is four plus three, which is seven months.

Looking back at the options, option H is seven months. So the answer should be H.

The bond was issued on June 1, year 1, with interest payment dates on April 1 and October 1. To determine the period for which bond interest expense is calculated for the year ended December 31, year 1, we need to consider the interest accrual periods.

1. **First Period (June 1 to October 1):** The bond was issued on June 1, and the first interest payment is on October 1. This period spans four months (June, July, August, and September).

2. **Second Period (October 1 to December 31):** After the October 1 payment, the next payment is on April 1 of the following year. However, since the financial year ends on December 31, the interest accrues only up to December 31. This period spans three months (October, November, and December).

Adding these two periods together, the total interest accrual period for the year ended December 31, year 1, is **seven months**.

From the given options, the correct answer is **H: Seven months**.
