Question:

The local high school football team won the state championship. After the game the high school held a victory rally at the high school gym. As the team was being honored, the star quarterback of the football team approached one of the cheerleaders and asked her out for a date. The cheerleader, who had a crush on the quarterback, said she'd love to go out with him. The quarterback told her, "Great, I'll pick you up at eight. "Later that evening, the quarterback was getting ready to drive to the cheerleader's home when his car wouldn't start. The quarterback then called his next-door neighbor and asked him if he could borrow his car. The neighbor agreed, but told him, "Okay, but make sure you return it by 2:00 a. m. " The quarterback assented and then drove to the cheerleader's house. After picking her up, they drove to an all-night coffee shop where they spent the night talking and catching up over coffee and waffles. Losing track of time, the quarterback and the cheerleader did not leave the coffee shop until 3:00 a. m. After returning home around 4:00 a. m. , the quarterback decided that it was too late to return the car, so he parked it in his driveway. He intended to return the car to the neighbor in the morning. A short while later, a thief stole the neighbor's car from outside the quarterback's home. The police found the car three months later, undamaged. The neighbor, however, refused to accept the car and brought a claim against the quarterback for conversion. In his claim, the neighbor will

Options:

A: not succeed, because the quarterback was not responsible for the theft.
B: not succeed, because the quarterback had no control over the actions of the thief.
C: succeed, because the quarterback had an obligation to protect the car.
D: succeed, because the quarterback left the car in his driveway, and it was stolen.
E: not succeed, because the car was returned undamaged.
F: not succeed, because the criminal act of the thief was unforeseeable.
G: succeed, because the quarterback could have returned the car and failed to do so.
H: succeed, because the quarterback failed to follow the neighbor's condition to return it by 2:00 a.m.
I: not succeed, because the quarterback intended to return the identical property he borrowed in an undamaged condition.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this tort law question about conversion. Let me start by reading the scenario carefully.

So, the high school quarterback borrowed his neighbor's car to take the cheerleader out. The neighbor said he could borrow it but must return it by 2 a.m. The quarterback agreed but ended up keeping it until the next morning because he lost track of time. Then, a thief stole the car from his driveway. The police found it three months later undamaged, but the neighbor refused to take it back and is suing for conversion.

Hmm, conversion is when someone significantly interferes with someone else's personal property, to the extent that the owner is deprived of it. It's like when someone takes or uses another's property without permission, causing the owner loss.

In this case, the quarterback borrowed the car with permission, so that's a bailment. As a bailee, he has a duty of care, which depends on whether it's a gratuitous or for-profit bailment. Here, it seems like a gratuitous bailment because the neighbor didn't charge anything. So the bailee's duty is to exercise ordinary care. But if he fails to return the property, does that amount to conversion?

Wait, the quarterback had permission to use the car until 2 a.m. But he didn't return it on time. So after 2 a.m., he was still using it without permission. That might be a conversion because he exceeded the scope of the bailment. But in this case, he kept the car overnight and parked it in his driveway, intending to return it in the morning. So he wasn't intending to steal it, but he didn't return it as agreed.

The car was stolen from his driveway. The question is whether the quarterback is liable for conversion because the car was stolen while in his possession beyond the agreed time.

I remember that a bailee can be liable if they are negligent in how they handle the property, leading to loss. But here, the car was stolen. So is the quarterback responsible for the theft?

Conversion requires intentional interference. So if the bailee's actions (or inactions) cause the loss, especially if they were negligent, the bailee might be liable. But wait, the neighbor is suing for conversion, not negligence.

Alternatively, if the bailee fails to return the property, that's a conversion because they are holding onto it beyond the agreed time. So even if he intended to return it the next day, he didn't return it as per the agreement. That could be a conversion because he's depriving the owner of possession.

But let's look at the options. Option C says the neighbor will succeed because the quarterback had an obligation to protect the car. But if the car was stolen due to no fault of his, maybe he isn't liable. Unless his negligence caused the theft. But the facts don't say he was negligent in how he parked it. He just parked it in his driveway, which is a normal place. Unless the area is high crime, but we don't know that.

Option H says the neighbor will succeed because the quarterback failed to return the car by 2 a.m. So, by keeping it past the agreed time, he converted it. Because he was supposed to return it by 2 a.m., but didn't, so he was holding it without permission, which is conversion.

Another angle: in a bailment, the bailee must return the property when the bailment ends. If the bailee fails to do so, that's conversion. So even if he intended to return it the next day, not returning it when agreed could be enough. So the neighbor could sue for conversion based on the failure to return on time.

Wait, but sometimes the law allows for a reasonable time after the agreed return time. If the bailee is a little late, maybe it's not conversion yet. But here, he kept it overnight, which is a significant delay. So that might cross into conversion.

Alternatively, the thief stealing the car while the quarterback had it might make the quarterback liable for the loss. But the car was found undamaged, so the neighbor is just refusing to take it back. That seems odd. Maybe the neighbor is upset about the late return.

So, the options: option H says the neighbor will succeed because the quarterback failed to return it by 2 a.m. That makes sense because the agreement was to return it by then, and he didn't, so he's liable for conversion.

Another option is option C, about the obligation to protect the car. But I think that's more about negligence, which isn't the same as conversion. Conversion is more about the act of depriving the owner of their property, regardless of negligence.

So I think the correct answer is H.

The scenario involves a bailment where the quarterback borrowed his neighbor's car with the condition to return it by 2:00 a.m. The quarterback failed to return the car on time, keeping it overnight, and the car was later stolen from his driveway. The neighbor sued for conversion, which occurs when someone significantly interferes with another's personal property, depriving the owner of its use or possession.

Key points:

1. **Bailment and Duty of Care**: As a bailee, the quarterback had a duty to return the car by the agreed time (2:00 a.m.). His failure to do so constitutes a breach of this duty, as he held the car beyond the authorized period without permission.

2. **Conversion**: Conversion does not require negligence but rather an intentional interference with the property. By keeping the car past the agreed return time, the quarterback deprived the neighbor of possession, which aligns with the definition of conversion.

3. **Options Analysis**:
   - **Option H** is correct because the quarterback failed to return the car by the agreed time, which constitutes conversion. His actions deprived the neighbor of the property, fulfilling the elements of conversion.
   - Other options, such as those focusing on negligence or unforeseeability, are less relevant because conversion hinges on the unauthorized retention of the property, not the circumstances of the theft.

Thus, the neighbor's claim for conversion will succeed because the quarterback failed to return the car as agreed.
