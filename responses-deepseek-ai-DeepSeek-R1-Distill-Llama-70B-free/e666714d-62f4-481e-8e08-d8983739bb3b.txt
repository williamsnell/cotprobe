Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the photoelectric effect. Hmm, I remember that the photoelectric effect involves electrons being ejected from a metal surface when light shines on it. The question has two parts, (a) and (b). Let me read it again.

The problem states that for a certain metal, when blue light of wavelength 4.1e-7 meters is used, the kinetic energy of the ejected electrons is 3.2e-19 J. Part (a) asks for the work function of the metal, and part (b) asks for the longest wavelength of light that will eject electrons.

I think I should tackle part (a) first. I remember the photoelectric equation: the energy of the incoming photon minus the work function equals the kinetic energy of the electron. Oh right, the equation is KE = hν - φ, where φ is the work function. But since ν is frequency, which is c over λ (c is the speed of light and λ is wavelength), I can rewrite the equation as KE = (hc/λ) - φ.

So for part (a), I have all the values needed. Let's plug them in. The wavelength λ is 4.1e-7 meters. Let me calculate the energy of the photon first. h is Planck's constant, which I remember is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. c is the speed of light, about 3e8 m/s.

So the photon energy E = hc/λ. Let's compute that. E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (4.1e-7). Let me calculate the numerator first: 6.626e-34 *3e8 is 1.9878e-25. Then divide by 4.1e-7: 1.9878e-25 / 4.1e-7 = approximately 4.847e-19 J.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. 6.626 *3 is about 19.878, so 19.878e-26 (since 1e-34 *1e8 is 1e-26). Oh wait, no, 6.626e-34 *3e8 is (6.626 *3) * (1e-34 *1e8) = 19.878e-26, which is 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Then dividing by 4.1e-7 m: (1.9878e-25 J·m) / (4.1e-7 m) = (1.9878 /4.1) *1e-18 J. 1.9878 /4.1 is approximately 0.4847, so 0.4847e-18 J is 4.847e-19 J.

So the photon energy is about 4.847e-19 J. The kinetic energy is given as 3.2e-19 J. Using the equation KE = E - φ, we can solve for φ.

So φ = E - KE = 4.847e-19 J - 3.2e-19 J = 1.647e-19 J. Wait, that's approximately 1.65e-19 J.

Looking at the options, let's see which have a work function around 1.65e-19. Option C says 1.6e-19, option E is 1.4e-19, option G is 1.5e-19, option J is 1.7e-19. So 1.65 is closest to 1.6e-19, which is option C. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should be more precise. Let me redo the calculation with exact numbers.

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s (exact value, but for calculation purposes, 6.626e-34 is fine).

c = 299792458 m/s ≈ 3e8 m/s.

λ = 4.1e-7 m.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (4.1e-7) = compute numerator first: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m (since 6.626 *3 = 19.878, so 19.878e-26 is 1.9878e-25).

Divide by 4.1e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 4.1e-7. Let me compute 1.9878 / 4.1 = approximately 0.4847. So 0.4847e-18 J = 4.847e-19 J.

So yes, E_photon = 4.847e-19 J.

Then φ = E_photon - KE = 4.847e-19 -3.2e-19 = 1.647e-19 J. So approximately 1.65e-19 J.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C (1.6e-19) and option J (1.7e-19). Hmm, 1.65 is exactly between 1.6 and 1.7. Let me check the options again.

Option C: 1.6e-19 J, 1.25e-6 m.

Option J: 1.7e-19 J, 1.20e-6 m.

Hmm, but perhaps the exact calculation with more precise numbers would yield a slightly different value. Let me try that.

Let me compute E_photon more accurately.

E_photon = (6.626e-34 * 299792458) / (4.1e-7).

But that's a bit tedious. Alternatively, I can compute it step by step.

Wait, 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Then divided by 4.1e-7 m.

Wait, 4.1e-7 is 0.41e-6. So 1.9878e-25 / 4.1e-7 = (1.9878 /4.1) * 1e-18.

1.9878 / 4.1 = let's compute: 4.1 * 0.4847 = approx 2. So 0.4847 as before.

So 0.4847 *1e-18 is 4.847e-19 J.

So φ = 4.847e-19 -3.2e-19 = 1.647e-19 J.

So 1.65e-19 is approximately 1.6e-19 or 1.7e-19. Hmm, the options have 1.6 and 1.7. Let me see if perhaps the exact calculation gives a value closer to 1.6e-19 or 1.7e-19.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate E_photon more accurately.

Wait, 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 6.626 *3 = 19.878, so 19.878e-26 J·m. Wait, no: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = (6.626 *3) * (1e-34 *1e8) =19.878e-26 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Then 1.9878e-25 /4.1e-7 = (1.9878 /4.1) * 1e-18.

1.9878 /4.1: let's compute this more accurately.

4.1 times 0.4847 is approximately 1.98777. So 1.9878 /4.1 = 0.4847 approximately. So 0.4847e-18 is 4.847e-19 J.

So E_photon is 4.847e-19 J.

So φ = 4.847e-19 -3.2e-19 = 1.647e-19 J.

That's approximately 1.65e-19 J. So between 1.6e-19 and 1.7e-19. Looking at the options, which one is present.

Looking at the options:

Option C: 1.6e-19 J, 1.25e-6 m.

Option J: 1.7e-19 J, 1.2e-6 m.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are A to J. Let me look:

Option C: 1.6 × 10^-19 J, 1.25 ×10^-6 m.

Option J: 1.7 ×10^-19 J, 1.20 ×10^-6 m.

Hmm, so our calculation for (a) is 1.65e-19 J. So none of the options exactly match, but the closest is either C or J. But perhaps I made a miscalculation. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider more precise values.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values for h and c. Let me try that.

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s (exact as per definition).

c = 299792458 m/s.

λ = 4.1e-7 m.

Compute E_photon = (h c) / λ.

So h*c =6.62607015e-34 * 299792458.

Let me compute that.

6.62607015e-34 * 299792458 = ?

Well, 6.62607015 * 2.99792458 ≈ let's compute 6.626 *3 = 19.878, but more accurately:

6.62607015 * 2.99792458.

Let me compute 6 *3 is 18. 0.62607015 *3 is about 1.878.

So 6 *2.99792458 is 17.98754748.

0.62607015 *2.99792458: let's compute. 0.6 *3 is 1.8, 0.02607 *3 is 0.0782, so about 1.878.

So total is approximately 17.9875 +1.8782 = 19.8657.

So 6.62607015e-34 * 2.99792458e8 = approximately 19.8657e-26 J·m, which is 1.98657e-25 J·m.

Then, E_photon = 1.98657e-25 J·m / 4.1e-7 m = (1.98657 /4.1 )e-18 J.

1.98657 /4.1 = let's compute:

4.1 * 0.4844 = ?

4.1 *0.4 = 1.64.

4.1 *0.08 = 0.328.

4.1 *0.0044= approx 0.01804.

So 1.64 +0.328=1.968; 1.968 +0.01804=1.98604.

So 4.1 * 0.4844 = approximately 1.98604.

So 1.98657 /4.1 = 0.4844 (since 4.1 *0.4844=1.98604, and we have 1.98657, which is 0.00053 more than 1.98604. So how much more? 0.00053 /4.1 ≈ 0.00013. So 0.4844 + 0.00013 = 0.4845. So 1.98657/4.1 ≈0.4845.

So E_photon ≈0.4845e-18 J = 4.845e-19 J.

So E_photon is 4.845e-19 J.

Then φ = E_photon - KE = 4.845e-19 -3.2e-19 = 1.645e-19 J.

So 1.645e-19 J. Hmm, which is 1.645, so between 1.6 and 1.7. So looking at the options, the closest is either 1.6 or 1.7.

Looking back at the options, option C has 1.6e-19 J, option J 1.7e-19 J.

Wait, but perhaps the actual value is approximately 1.65e-19, so not matching exactly. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about part (b) as well, since the work function is used there.

Part (b) asks for the longest wavelength that can eject electrons, which is when the energy of the photon equals the work function. Because the longest wavelength corresponds to the lowest energy (since E=hc/λ; as λ increases, E decreases).

So for part (b), the threshold wavelength λ_0 is when KE=0, so E_photon = φ.

So λ_0 = hc / φ.

So I'll need to compute λ_0 once I have φ.

But to answer part (a), I need to get the work function, which is 1.65e-19 J. But none of the options have that exact value. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I should check the numbers again. Maybe the initial data.

Blue light with wavelength 4.1e-7 m. Kinetic energy is 3.2e-19 J.

So let me recalculate E_photon.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s.

c= 3e8 m/s.

λ=4.1e-7 m.

E_photon= (6.626e-34 *3e8) /4.1e-7.

So 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 4.1e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 /4.1e-7 = 4.847e-19 J.

Yes, same as before. Then φ=4.847e-19 -3.2e-19 =1.647e-19 J.

So about 1.65e-19 J.

Looking at the options, perhaps the closest is option C (1.6e-19) or option J (1.7e-19). Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Wait, 1.647e-19 is 1.647. So the options have 1.6 and 1.7. So perhaps the intended answer is 1.6e-19 J. So option C.

But wait, another possibility: perhaps the kinetic energy is given as exactly 3.2e-19 J, and the calculation leads to a work function of 1.6e-19 J exactly, but perhaps I made a mistake in the E_photon calculation.

Wait, let me compute E_photon again. 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Divide by 4.1e-7 m.

1.9878e-25 /4.1e-7 = (1.9878 /4.1 )e-18.

1.9878 /4.1 = let's compute exactly.

4.1 into 1.9878.

4.1 *0.484 = 4.1 *0.4 =1.64; 4.1 *0.08=0.328; 4.1 *0.004=0.0164. So 0.4+0.08+0.004=0.484.

1.64 +0.328=1.968; +0.0164=1.9844. So 4.1 *0.484=1.9844.

The numerator is 1.9878. So 1.9878 -1.9844=0.0034 left.

So 0.0034 /4.1 = 0.000829. So total is 0.484 +0.000829= 0.484829.

So 0.484829e-18 =4.84829e-19 J.

So E_photon is approximately 4.848e-19 J.

So φ=4.848e-19 -3.2e-19 =1.648e-19 J.

So 1.648e-19 J, which is 1.65e-19 J when rounded to two decimal places.

Looking at the options, I don't see an option with exactly 1.65e-19 J. So perhaps this is a miscalculation, or perhaps the options have rounded. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option C: 1.6e-19 J, 1.25e-6 m.

Option J: 1.7e-19 J, 1.20e-6 m.

Hmm. So neither is exactly 1.65e-19. But perhaps the intended answer is option C, as it's the closer one.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute part (b) to see which option gives a consistent answer. Because the work function would determine the threshold wavelength.

So for part (b), the threshold wavelength λ_0 is given by φ = hc/λ_0 → λ_0 = hc/φ.

So once I have φ, I can compute λ_0.

Let's attempt that.

Assuming φ is 1.6e-19 J.

So hc = 6.626e-34 *3e8 =1.9878e-25 J·m.

λ_0 = 1.9878e-25 /1.6e-19 = (1.9878 /1.6 )e-6 meters.

1.9878 /1.6 = approx 1.2424.

So λ_0 ≈1.2424e-6 m, which is 1.24e-6 m, or 1.24 micrometers.

Looking at option C, their part (b) answer is 1.25e-6 m. That's very close. So option C's part (b) is 1.25e-6 m, which aligns with our calculation when φ is 1.6e-19 J.

Alternatively, if φ was 1.65e-19, then λ_0 =1.9878e-25 /1.65e-19 = approx 1.205e-6 m.

But none of the options have 1.205e-6 m for (b). Let's check what each option says.

Option C: (a)1.6e-19, (b)1.25
