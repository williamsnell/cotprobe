Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about mixing ice and water. Let me read the question again. 

The problem says: 500 grams of ice at 0°C is added to 500 grams of water at 64°C. When the temperature of the mixture reaches 0°C, what weight of ice is still present? The heat of fusion of water is given as 80 cal/g. The options are A through J, with various weights.

Hmm, I remember that when ice and water mix, heat transfer occurs until thermal equilibrium is reached. Since the final temperature is 0°C, the ice isn't all melted, but some of it must have melted, right?

Wait, let me think. Ice at 0°C can absorb heat, which would cause it to melt. On the other hand, the water at 64°C would lose heat until it cools down to 0°C. So the heat lost by the water should equal the heat gained by the ice, but considering both melting and possibly warming (but in this case, since ice is at 0, and water is cooling to 0, maybe it's just melting).

Wait, no. Wait, the ice is already at 0°C, so all the heat it absorbs will go into melting it into water at 0°C. The water, which is at 64°C, will cool down to 0°C, releasing heat in the process.

So the heat lost by the water (cooling from 64°C to 0°C) will be equal to the heat gained by the ice (melting at 0°C).

But wait, the final state is all at 0°C. So the ice and water will be mixed, but some ice might remain if not all the ice has melted. So the question is, how much ice is left when the system reaches 0°C.

Wait, but in this case, the ice and water are both present. So the key is to calculate how much ice melts and how much remains.

So the formula for heat transfer is Q = mcΔT for the water cooling, and Q = m * L for the ice melting, where L is the latent heat of fusion.

Wait, but since the ice is melting, the heat comes from the water cooling. So:

Heat lost by water = Heat gained by ice.

So:

m_water * c_water * ΔT = m_ice * L

Wait, but wait. Let me get the variables right.

The mass of water is 500 g. The initial temperature is 64°C, and it cools to 0°C, so ΔT is 64°C.

The specific heat capacity of water is usually around 1 cal/g°C, but I think that's what we'll use here unless stated otherwise. Oh, the problem doesn't give it, but I think I can assume it's 1 cal/g°C because that's standard.

Wait, no, the problem doesn't give the specific heat. Hmm, maybe I missed it. Oh wait, the problem only gives the heat of fusion, which is 80 cal/g. So perhaps the specific heat is a known value to use, like 1 cal/g°C.

So assuming c = 1 cal/g°C.

So the heat released by the water is m_water * c * (T_initial - T_final) = 500 g * 1 cal/g°C * (64 - 0) = 500 * 64 = 32,000 calories.

This heat is absorbed by the ice, which is at 0°C, so it goes into melting the ice. The heat required to melt the ice is m_ice * L. So m_ice = Q / L.

Wait, but wait. The initial ice is 500 g, but some of it might melt. So the mass of ice that melts would be m_melted = Q / L.

So Q is 32,000 cal. L is 80 cal/g. So m_melted = 32,000 / 80 = 400 grams.

Wait, but wait. If 400 grams of ice melt, then the initial ice was 500 grams, so the remaining ice is 500 - 400 = 100 grams.

Wait, but wait, but that can't be right. Because the water is cooling down, and the ice is melting. But if all 500g of ice were to melt, it would require 500 * 80 = 40,000 cal. But the water can only provide 32,000 cal. So only part of the ice melts.

So 32,000 cal divided by 80 cal/g is 400 g of ice melted. So the remaining ice is 500 - 400 = 100 grams. So the answer would be 100 grams, which is option H.

But let me check my steps again.

1. Calculate heat released by water cooling to 0°C.
   Q_water = m * c * ΔT = 500g * 1 cal/g°C * 64°C = 32,000 cal.

2. This heat is used to melt ice, so Q_ice = m_ice * Lfusion.
   So m_ice = 32,000 / 80 = 400g melted.

3. So initial ice was 500g, so remaining is 100g. So the answer is 100g, option H.

To determine how much ice remains when the mixture reaches 0°C, we analyze the heat transfer between the ice and the water. The heat lost by the water as it cools to 0°C is equal to the heat gained by the ice as it melts.

1. **Heat released by the water**:  
   The water cools from 64°C to 0°C. Using the formula \( Q = mc\Delta T \), where \( m = 500 \, \text{g} \), \( c = 1 \, \text{cal/g°C} \), and \( \Delta T = 64 \, \text{°C} \):  
   \[
   Q_{\text{water}} = 500 \cdot 1 \cdot 64 = 32,000 \, \text{cal}.
   \]

2. **Heat required to melt ice**:  
   The heat of fusion of ice is \( L = 80 \, \text{cal/g} \). The mass of ice that can melt with the available heat is:  
   \[
   m_{\text{melted}} = \frac{Q_{\text{water}}}{L} = \frac{32,000}{80} = 400 \, \text{g}.
   \]

3. **Remaining ice**:  
   Initially, there was 500 g of ice. After 400 g melts, the remaining ice is:  
   \[
   m_{\text{remaining}} = 500 - 400 = 100 \, \text{g}.
   \]

Thus, when the temperature of the mixture reaches 0°C, 100 g of ice remains. The correct answer is:

H: 100 g
