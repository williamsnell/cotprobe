Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the scalar potential function of a given vector function. The vector function is A† = 2xy î + x² ĵ + 3z² k̂. Hmm, I remember that a vector field is conservative if it can be expressed as the gradient of a scalar potential. So, my goal is to find a scalar function f such that the gradient of f equals A†.

Wait, the gradient in three dimensions is (∂f/∂x, ∂f/∂y, ∂f/∂z). So each component of A† should correspond to the partial derivatives of f with respect to x, y, and z respectively.

Let me break it down component by component.

First, the x-component of A† is 2xy. That should be equal to ∂f/∂x. So, I can write:

∂f/∂x = 2xy.

To find f, I need to integrate this with respect to x. Integrating 2xy dx... the integral of 2xy is x²y, because the integral of 2x is x², and y is treated as a constant when integrating with respect to x. So integrating gives x²y plus a constant of integration, which in this case would be a function of y and z, since we're integrating with respect to x. Let me write f(x,y,z) = x²y + g(y,z), where g is a function that depends on y and z.

Next, the y-component of A† is x². So, ∂f/∂y should equal x². Let's compute ∂f/∂y from what we have so far.

f = x²y + g(y,z). So, ∂f/∂y is x² plus the partial derivative of g with respect to y. So:

x² + ∂g/∂y = x².

Wait, that means ∂g/∂y must be zero. Because x² + 0 = x². So, g doesn't depend on y. Therefore, g(y,z) is only a function of z. Let's say g(y,z)=h(z).

Now the function f becomes f(x,y,z) = x²y + h(z).

Moving on to the z-component of A†, which is 3z². So ∂f/∂z should be 3z². Let's compute it from f:

f = x²y + h(z). So, ∂f/∂z is the derivative of h(z) with respect to z. Therefore:

dh/dz = 3z².

Integrate that with respect to z. The integral of 3z² is z³ plus a constant. So h(z) = z³ + C, where C is a constant.

Putting it all together, f(x,y,z) = x²y + z³ + C.

Now I need to look at the options to see which one matches this. Let's check each option.

Option A: 2x²y + 3z^3 + C → The coefficients don't match. Our x²y term is 1x²y, so this can't be right.

Option B: x²y + z^3 + C → Yes, this matches exactly what I found. x squared y plus z cubed plus a constant.

Wait, let me double-check. Did I make a mistake anywhere? Let me go through the steps again quickly.

The x-component: 2xy → integrated to x²y, correct.

Then y-component: x² → so derivative of x²y with respect to y is x², and nothing else, so g is function of z only.

z-component: 3z² → integral is z³, yes. So f is x² y + z³ + C.

Looking back at the options, option B is x²y + z³ + C. That's correct.

To determine the scalar potential function \( f(x, y, z) \) of the vector function \( \mathbf{A}^\dagger = 2xy\,\hat{i} + x^2\,\hat{j} + 3z^2\,\hat{k} \), we need to find a function \( f \) such that \( \nabla f = \mathbf{A}^\dagger \). The gradient in three dimensions is given by:

\[
\nabla f = \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} \right).
\]

### Step 1: Integrate the \( x \)-component
The \( x \)-component of \( \mathbf{A}^\dagger \) is \( 2xy \), so:
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 2xy.
\]
Integrating \( 2xy \) with respect to \( x \), we get:
\[
f(x, y, z) = x^2y + g(y, z),
\]
where \( g(y, z) \) is a function of \( y \) and \( z \) (the constant of integration).

### Step 2: Differentiate with respect to \( y \)
The \( y \)-component of \( \mathbf{A}^\dagger \) is \( x^2 \), so:
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = x^2.
\]
From \( f(x, y, z) = x^2y + g(y, z) \), we compute:
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = x^2 + \frac{\partial g}{\partial y}.
\]
Equating this to \( x^2 \), we find:
\[
\frac{\partial g}{\partial y} = 0.
\]
This implies that \( g(y, z) \) does not depend on \( y \), so \( g(y, z) = h(z) \), where \( h(z) \) is a function of \( z \) only. Now, the function becomes:
\[
f(x, y, z) = x^2y + h(z).
\]

### Step 3: Differentiate with respect to \( z \)
The \( z \)-component of \( \mathbf{A}^\dagger \) is \( 3z^2 \), so:
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial z} = 3z^2.
\]
From \( f(x, y, z) = x^2y + h(z) \), we compute:
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial z} = \frac{dh}{dz}.
\]
Equating this to \( 3z^2 \), we find:
\[
\frac{dh}{dz} = 3z^2.
\]
Integrating \( 3z^2 \) with respect to \( z \), we get:
\[
h(z) = z^3 + C,
\]
where \( C \) is a constant.

### Final Result
Substituting \( h(z) = z^3 + C \) into \( f(x, y, z) = x^2y + h(z) \), we obtain:
\[
f(x, y, z) = x^2y + z^3 + C.
\]

### Matching with the Options
The correct option is **B: \( x^2y + z^3 + C \)**, as it matches the derived scalar potential function.
