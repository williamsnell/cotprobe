Okay, so I need to figure out this question about TV screens and the colors they display. The question is asking, when the color yellow is seen on the TV screen, which phosphors are being activated. The options are from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that TVs use a combination of colors to produce images. I think it's something to do with primary colors. Wait, primary colors for light are red, green, and blue. Right, because when you mix different combinations of these, you can create all the other colors. So the TV screen probably has tiny phosphor dots that emit red, green, or blue light when activated by electrons.

Yellow is the color we're focusing on here. So how do you get yellow from red, green, and blue? Oh, right! Yellow is made by combining red and green light. Because if you mix red and green, you get yellow. Like when you mix paint, but wait, no, wait. Wait, paint is different. Paint is subtractive, where the primary colors are magenta, cyan, and yellow. But for light, it's additive. So in additive color mixing, red + green gives yellow. Because each color adds its wavelengths.

So the TV screen must have phosphors that emit red, green, and blue. When the TV needs to display yellow, it activates the red and green phosphors. So the correct answer should be the option that says red and green phosphors are activated.

Looking at the options, option B is red and green. Option J is blue and green, which would make cyan, I think. Option C is blue and red, which makes magenta. Option I is mainly yellow, but I don't think TVs have yellow phosphors; they combine primary colors. So option B must be the right choice.

When the color yellow appears on a TV screen, it is created by activating the red and green phosphors. This is because yellow is an additive mixture of red and green light. 

The correct answer is B.
