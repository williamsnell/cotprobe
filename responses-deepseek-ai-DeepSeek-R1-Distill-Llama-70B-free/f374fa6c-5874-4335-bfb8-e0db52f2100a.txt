Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about equilibrium, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says: Four moles of PCl5 are placed in a 2-liter flask. When equilibrium is established for the reaction PCl5 ⇌ PCl3 + Cl2, the flask contains 0.8 moles of Cl2. I need to find the equilibrium constant, and choose the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, so the first thing I should probably do is write down the chemical equation and the initial changes. The reaction is the decomposition of PCl5 into PCl3 and Cl2. 

Let me jot down what I know. The initial amount of PCl5 is 4 moles in a 2-liter flask. Since it's a 2-liter flask, concentrations would be moles divided by 2 liters. So initial concentrations are [PCl5] = 4/2 = 2 M, and both [PCl3] and [Cl2] are 0 because nothing has reacted yet.

At equilibrium, they tell me that [Cl2] is 0.8 moles. Wait, no, wait, the flask contains 0.8 moles of Cl2. But wait, the flask is 2 liters, so the concentration would be 0.8 / 2 = 0.4 M. Hmm, but wait, wait a second. Let me think again. Because when the system reaches equilibrium, the amount of Cl2 is 0.8 moles. So in terms of concentration, that's 0.8 / 2 L = 0.4 M. So [Cl2] is 0.4 M at equilibrium.

Since Cl2 is a product, I can model the changes using an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium). Let me set that up.

The reaction: PCl5 ⇌ PCl3 + Cl2.

Initial concentrations:
[PCl5] = 2 M (since 4 moles in 2 L)
[PCl3] = 0
[Cl2] = 0

Change:
Let x be the amount of PCl5 that dissociates. So, for every mole of PCl5 that breaks down, it produces one mole each of PCl3 and Cl2. So the changes would be:
- PCl5: -x
- PCl3: +x
- Cl2: +x

But wait, at equilibrium, Cl2's concentration is 0.4 M. Since the change for Cl2 is +x, that means x equals 0.4 M. Because the equilibrium concentration of Cl2 is 0.4 M, so x = 0.4. 

So plugging that back into the ICE table, the equilibrium concentrations would be:

[PCl5] = 2 - x = 2 - 0.4 = 1.6 M
[PCl3] = 0 + x = 0.4 M
[Cl2] = 0 + x = 0.4 M

Wait, but wait a minute. I thought that the amount of Cl2 was 0.8 moles, which is 0.4 M in 2 liters. So that's correct. So the change x is 0.4.

Now, the equilibrium constant K for this reaction is given by the expression:

K = [PCl3][Cl2] / [PCl5]

Plugging the equilibrium concentrations into this:

K = (0.4)(0.4) / (1.6)

Calculate the numerator: 0.4 * 0.4 = 0.16
Denominator: 1.6

So K = 0.16 / 1.6 = 0.1

Wait, 0.16 divided by 1.6 is 0.1. So K is 0.1. Let me check the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, another way to think about this: If 0.8 moles of Cl2 are present in 2 liters, that's 0.4 M. So x is 0.4, so PCl3 is 0.4 M and PCl5 is 2 - 0.4 = 1.6 M.

So K = (0.4 * 0.4) / 1.6 = 0.16 / 1.6 = 0.1. So that looks correct.

Looking at the answer options, option D is 0.1 M. Wait, but wait, wait. The question asks for the equilibrium constant, which is unitless because it's based on concentrations, but the options are given with M units. So that might be a typo in the options, but I'm guessing the correct value is 0.1, which is option D.

Wait, but let me double-check the setup. I started with 4 moles of PCl5, so 2 M in a 2L flask. Then, x moles per liter reacted, giving x M of PCl3 and Cl2 each. So yes, x is 0.4. So that part is correct.

Another thing to check: the stoichiometry. The reaction is 1:1:1, so the change for each product is the same as x. So that's correct.

So the calculation for K is correct, and K is 0.1, which is option D.

To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the equilibrium reaction:

\[
\text{PCl}_5 \rightleftharpoons \text{PCl}_3 + \text{Cl}_2
\]

### Step 1: Initial Conditions
- Initial moles of PCl\(_5\): 4 moles in a 2-liter flask, so initial concentration = \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \, \text{M} \).
- Initial concentrations of PCl\(_3\) and Cl\(_2\): 0 M.

### Step 2: Changes at Equilibrium
- Let \( x \) represent the amount of PCl\(_5\) that dissociates.
- At equilibrium:
  - \([ \text{PCl}_5 ] = 2 - x\)
  - \([ \text{PCl}_3 ] = x\)
  - \([ \text{Cl}_2 ] = x\)

The problem states that the equilibrium concentration of Cl\(_2\) is 0.4 M (since 0.8 moles in 2 liters = \( \frac{0.8}{2} = 0.4 \, \text{M} \)). Therefore, \( x = 0.4 \).

### Step 3: Equilibrium Concentrations
Substituting \( x = 0.4 \):
- \([ \text{PCl}_5 ] = 2 - 0.4 = 1.6 \, \text{M}\)
- \([ \text{PCl}_3 ] = 0.4 \, \text{M}\)
- \([ \text{Cl}_2 ] = 0.4 \, \text{M}\)

### Step 4: Equilibrium Constant Expression
The equilibrium constant \( K \) is given by:

\[
K = \frac{[ \text{PCl}_3 ][ \text{Cl}_2 ]}{[ \text{PCl}_5 ]}
\]

Substituting the equilibrium concentrations:

\[
K = \frac{(0.4)(0.4)}{1.6} = \frac{0.16}{1.6} = 0.1
\]

### Step 5: Final Answer
The equilibrium constant \( K \) is 0.1. Among the options provided, the correct choice is:

**D: 0.1M**
