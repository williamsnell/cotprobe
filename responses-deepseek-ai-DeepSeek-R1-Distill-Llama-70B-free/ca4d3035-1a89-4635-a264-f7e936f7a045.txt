Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what Newton's Law of cooling is as applied to convective heat transfer. Hmm, I remember that Newton's Law has something to do with the rate of cooling, right? I think it's about how the heat transfer is proportional to the temperature difference. Let me think more.

Wait, convective heat transfer involves a coefficient called the heat transfer coefficient, h. I remember seeing an equation with h, the area A, and a temperature difference, ΔT. Oh right, Newton's Law of cooling states that the rate of heat loss of a body is directly proportional to the temperature difference between the body and its surroundings. So the formula should be q equals h times A times the delta T.

Looking at the options, option A is q = hAΔT. That fits what I was thinking. Let me double-check the other options to make sure. Option B has h squared, which doesn't seem right. Option C uses squared temperatures, which doesn't match. Option D has h times delta T over A, which inverts the area, so probably wrong. Option E has a division by T, which I don't think is part of the law. Option F has a division by k, which is thermal conductivity, but that's more related to conduction, not convection. Option G is h over A times delta T, which again seems inverted. Option H is delta T over hA, which is the reciprocal of what we want. Option I squares delta T, which doesn't fit. Option J uses k instead of h, so that's probably Fourier's law for conduction.

So yes, option A is the correct one.

Newton's Law of cooling describes the rate of convective heat transfer and states that the heat flux is proportional to the temperature difference between a body and its surroundings. The formula is:

\[
q = hA\Delta T
\]

where:
- \( q \) is the heat transfer rate,
- \( h \) is the convective heat transfer coefficient,
- \( A \) is the surface area, and
- \( \Delta T \) is the temperature difference.

Analyzing the options:
- **A**: Matches the correct formula \( q = hA\Delta T \).
- **B**: Incorrect, as it introduces \( h^2 \), which is not part of the law.
- **C**: Incorrect, as it involves squared temperatures, which is not consistent with the law.
- **D**: Incorrect, as it inverts the relationship between \( h \), \( A \), and \( \Delta T \).
- **E**: Incorrect, as it introduces a division by \( T \), which is unrelated.
- **F**: Incorrect, as it involves \( k \) (thermal conductivity), which pertains to conduction, not convection.
- **G**: Incorrect, as it inverts the relationship between \( h \) and \( A \).
- **H**: Incorrect, as it represents the reciprocal of the correct formula.
- **I**: Incorrect, as it squares \( \Delta T \), which is not part of the law.
- **J**: Incorrect, as it uses \( k \) instead of \( h \), making it relevant to conduction, not convection.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**A**
