Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the problem is about partial pressures of gases collected over water. Hmm, I remember that when you collect a gas over water, the total pressure is the sum of the gas pressure and the water vapor pressure. Oh right, because the water evaporates into the gas, adding to the pressure.

So the setup here is a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen collected by displacement of water. The temperature is 30°C, and the total pressure is 700 torrHg. The partial pressure of nitrogen is given as 550 torrHg. They're asking for the partial pressure of oxygen.

Wait, but wait. I think I should consider Dalton's Law here. Dalton's Law says that the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of each gas plus the vapor pressure of water. Because the gas is collected over water, so water vapor is present.

So the formula should be: P_total = P_N2 + P_O2 + P_H2O.

But wait, wait. No, wait. No, I think I mixed up. Actually, when you collect a gas over water, the total pressure (external) is equal to the sum of the partial pressure of the gas and the water vapor. But in this case, the mixture is of two gases, nitrogen and oxygen, so their partial pressures plus the water vapor equals the total pressure.

Wait no, wait. The total pressure is the sum of all the partial pressures. So if the gas is a mixture of N2 and O2, and the system is saturated with water vapor because it's in contact with water, then the total pressure is P_total = P_N2 + P_O2 + P_H2O.

Wait wait, but no. No, wait. Because the gas is collected over water, the pressure inside the container is the sum of the dry gas pressure (the mixture of N2 and O2) and the water vapor. So the total pressure measured is P_total = P_dry_gas + P_H2O.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. When a gas is collected over water, the total pressure is the sum of the partial pressure of the gas (the dry part) and the water vapor. So for a dry gas mixture of N2 and O2, their combined partial pressure is P_total - P_H2O. Because P_total = P_dry + P_water.

So in this case, the dry gas is the mixture of N2 and O2. So the sum of their partial pressures is 700 torr minus the vapor pressure of water, which is 32 torr. So, P_dry = 700 - 32 = 668 torr.

Wait, that makes sense. So the total pressure is 700 torr, which includes the gas mixture and the water vapor. So the gas mixture's total partial pressure is 700 - 32 = 668 torr.

Now, in that 668 torr, the partial pressure of N2 is 550 torr. So the partial pressure of O2 would be 668 - 550 = 118 torr.

Wait, let me write that down step by step.

1. Total pressure (P_total) = 700 torr.
2. Vapor pressure of water (P_H2O) = 32 torr.
3. So, the pressure of the gas mixture (N2 + O2) is P_gas = P_total - P_H2O = 700 -32 = 668 torr.
4. Partial pressure of N2 (P_N2) = 550 torr.
5. So, partial pressure of O2 (P_O2) = P_gas - P_N2 = 668 -550 = 118 torr.

So looking at the options, 118 torr is option F.

Wait, but let me double-check. Oh wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Because sometimes the way the question is phrased can be tricky. Oh, no, wait. The problem says the mixture is collected by displacement of water, which implies that the pressure includes the water vapor. So the calculation is correct.

Alternatively, another way to approach it: the sum of all partial pressures equals the total pressure.

So, P_total = P_N2 + P_O2 + P_H2O.

We have P_N2 = 550, P_H2O =32, P_total=700.

So 700 = 550 + P_O2 +32 → P_O2 =700 -550 -32 → 700-582=118. So same result.

Yes. So the answer is 118 torr, which is option F.

To determine the partial pressure of oxygen in the gas mixture, we use Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures and account for the vapor pressure of water. The total pressure is given as 700 torrHg, and the vapor pressure of water at 30°C is 32 torrHg. The partial pressure of nitrogen is 550 torrHg.

1. The total pressure is the sum of the partial pressures of nitrogen, oxygen, and water vapor:
   \[
   P_{\text{total}} = P_{\text{N}_2} + P_{\text{O}_2} + P_{\text{H}_2\text{O}}
   \]

2. Rearranging for \(P_{\text{O}_2}\):
   \[
   P_{\text{O}_2} = P_{\text{total}} - P_{\text{N}_2} - P_{\text{H}_2\text{O}}
   \]

3. Substituting the known values:
   \[
   P_{\text{O}_2} = 700 \, \text{torr} - 550 \, \text{torr} - 32 \, \text{torr} = 118 \, \text{torr}
   \]

Thus, the partial pressure of oxygen is 118 torr, which corresponds to option **F**.
