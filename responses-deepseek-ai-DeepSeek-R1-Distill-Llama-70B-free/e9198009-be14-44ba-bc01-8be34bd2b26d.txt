Question:

A student pushes a puck across a table, moving it from position x = 0 to position x = 0.2 m. After he lets go, the puck continues to travel across the table, coming to rest at position x = 1.2 m. When the puck is at position x = 1.0 m, which of the following is a correct assertion about the net force on the puck?

Options:

A: The net force is in the negative direction, because the puck is moving in the positive direction but slowing down.
B: The net force is in the negative direction, because the student’s push caused the puck to slow down in the positive direction.
C: The net force is down, because the puck is near the Earth, where gravitational acceleration is 10 m/s^2 downward.
D: The net force is in the positive direction, because the force of friction is in the negative direction.
E: The net force is up, because the puck is near the Earth, where gravitational acceleration is 10 m/s^2 upward.
F: The net force is in the positive direction, because the puck is moving in the positive direction.
G: The net force is zero, because the student’s push in the positive direction must equal the force of friction in the negative direction.
H: The net force is zero, because the puck is in motion and not accelerating.
I: The net force is in the positive direction, because the student’s push caused the puck to speed up in the positive direction.
J: The net force is zero, because the puck is at rest at position x = 1.0 m.

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a puck moving across a table. I'm a bit rusty on my mechanics, but I'll try to think through it step by step. Let's see what the question is.

The problem says a student pushes a puck from x=0 to x=0.2 m. Then the puck continues moving until it stops at x=1.2 m. The question is about the net force on the puck when it's at x=1.0 m. Hmm, I need to figure out what's happening here.

So, when the student pushes the puck from 0 to 0.2 m, I imagine that's the initial push. After that, the puck is moving on its own, right? So after the student lets go, the puck keeps going but eventually comes to a stop. So that means there's some force acting on it to slow it down. I'm thinking friction, because that's usually the opposing force when objects slide.

Wait, friction. Yeah, friction would be acting opposite to the direction of motion. So when the puck is moving in the positive x-direction (which I'll assume is to the right), the frictional force is in the negative x-direction, slowing it down. 

Now, the question is about when the puck is at x=1.0 m. That's after the student has let go. So from 0.2 m to 1.2 m, the puck is moving under the influence of friction. So between 0.2 and 1.2 m, the puck is decelerating until it stops.

At x=1.0 m, the puck is still moving, but it's slowing down. So it's in motion, but its velocity is decreasing. That means the acceleration is in the opposite direction of the velocity. Since velocity is positive (still moving to the right), acceleration must be negative. So F=ma, the net force is in the negative direction.

Looking at the options, let's go through them. 

Option A: Net force negative because puck is moving positive but slowing down. That makes sense because if it's slowing down, acceleration is negative, so net force is negative. So A could be correct.

Option B: Net force negative because the student's push caused it to slow down. Wait, no. The student's push is during the initial phase, from 0 to 0.2 m. After that, the only force is friction. So the push isn't directly causing the slowing down anymore; it's the friction. So B seems incorrect because it's attributing the slowing to the student's push, which isn't active anymore.

Option C: Net force down due to gravity. Well, gravity is acting downward, but in this scenario, the puck is on a table. So the normal force would balance the weight. The net force on the puck in the vertical direction is zero. But the question is about the net force in the x-direction. So C is talking about down, which is perpendicular. So C is incorrect.

Option D: Net force positive because friction is negative. Wait, no. The net force is the sum of all forces. If friction is the only force acting (since the push is gone), then net force is friction, which is negative. So D is wrong because it says the net is positive.

Option E: Net force up due to gravity. No, gravity is down, so E is wrong.

Option F: Net force positive because puck is moving positive. No, because the puck is slowing down, so acceleration is negative. So net force is negative. So F is wrong.

Option G: Net force zero because push equals friction. No, because the push is only during the initial 0.2 m. After that, the push stops, so the only force is friction. So G is wrong.

Option H: Net force zero because puck is moving without accelerating. But the puck is slowing down, so it's accelerating (decelerating). So H is wrong.

Option I: Net force positive because student's push caused it to speed up. Again, the push is only during the initial phase. So I is wrong.

Option J: Net force zero because puck is at rest at x=1.0 m. No, because the puck is at x=1.0 m but it hasn't stopped yet. It stops at 1.2 m. So J is wrong.

So the correct answer should be A. Because the puck is moving in positive x but slowing down, so net force is negative (same as the direction of friction).

The problem involves a puck moving across a table, initially pushed by a student from \( x = 0 \) to \( x = 0.2 \, \text{m} \), and then continuing to move under the influence of friction until it comes to rest at \( x = 1.2 \, \text{m} \). The question asks about the net force on the puck when it is at \( x = 1.0 \, \text{m} \).

After the student lets go at \( x = 0.2 \, \text{m} \), the puck moves under the sole influence of friction, which acts opposite to the direction of motion (negative \( x \)-direction). At \( x = 1.0 \, \text{m} \), the puck is still moving in the positive \( x \)-direction but is slowing down, meaning its velocity is decreasing. According to Newton's second law, this deceleration implies a net force in the negative \( x \)-direction, which is the direction of the frictional force.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Correct. The puck is moving in the positive direction but slowing down, so the net force (friction) is in the negative direction.
- **B**: Incorrect. The student's push is no longer acting on the puck after \( x = 0.2 \, \text{m} \); the slowing down is due to friction, not the push.
- **C**: Incorrect. The question asks about the net force in the \( x \)-direction, not vertical forces like gravity.
- **D**: Incorrect. The net force is not positive; it is negative because friction is the only force acting.
- **E**: Incorrect. Gravity acts downward, not upward, and the question is about horizontal forces.
- **F**: Incorrect. The net force is not positive; the puck is decelerating, so the net force is negative.
- **G**: Incorrect. The push and friction balanced only during the initial push (from \( x = 0 \) to \( x = 0.2 \, \text{m} \)), not after the student lets go.
- **H**: Incorrect. The puck is decelerating, so it is accelerating (in the negative direction), meaning the net force is not zero.
- **I**: Incorrect. The student's push is no longer acting on the puck after \( x = 0.2 \, \text{m} \).
- **J**: Incorrect. The puck is not at rest at \( x = 1.0 \, \text{m} \); it comes to rest at \( x = 1.2 \, \text{m} \).

The correct answer is **A**, as the net force on the puck at \( x = 1.0 \, \text{m} \) is in the negative direction due to friction, which causes the puck to slow down.
