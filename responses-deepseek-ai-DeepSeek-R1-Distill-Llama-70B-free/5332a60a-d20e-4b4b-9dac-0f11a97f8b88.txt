Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the OLS estimator for the standard error of the slope coefficient. Hmm, I remember that OLS stands for Ordinary Least Squares, which is a method used in regression analysis. The standard error of the slope coefficient tells us about the variability or dispersion of the slope estimate. I think the question is asking which statements about this standard error are true.

Let me go through each statement one by one.

Statement (i) says the standard error will be positively related to the residual variance. Residual variance is the variance of the error terms in the regression. I remember that the formula for the standard error of the slope (let's call it se_b) is something like se_b = (residual standard error) / (standard deviation of the explanatory variable * sqrt(n)). Wait, but residual standard error is the square root of the residual variance. So if residual variance increases, the residual standard error increases, which would make se_b larger. So yes, (i) should be true because a higher residual variance leads to a higher standard error.

Statement (ii) claims the standard error will be negatively related to the dispersion of the observations on the explanatory variable about their mean. Dispersion here probably refers to the variance or standard deviation of the x-variable. Looking back at the formula, se_b is inversely proportional to the standard deviation of x (because it's divided by it). So if the dispersion (variance or std dev) of x increases, se_b decreases. So (ii) is correct as well.

Statement (iii) says the standard error is negatively related to the sample size. From the formula, se_b is divided by sqrt(n), so as n increases, the denominator gets bigger, making se_b smaller. So yes, as sample size increases, the standard error decreases. So (iii) is true.

Statement (iv) states that the standard error gives a measure of the precision of the coefficient estimate. Precision in statistics usually refers to how consistent the estimates are across different samples. A smaller standard error means the estimate is more precise because the sampling distribution is tighter around the true value. So yes, (iv) is correct.

Now looking back at the statements, all four (i) through (iv) seem to be correct. Wait, but let me double-check. Wait, the formula is se_b = (residual standard error) / (std_x * sqrt(n)). So:

- As residual variance (and hence residual standard error) increases, se_b increases. So (i) is true.
- As std_x increases, se_b decreases. So (ii) is true.
- As n increases, se_b decreases. So (iii) is true.
- se_b measures how much the slope estimate would vary from sample to sample, so it's a measure of precision. So (iv) is correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B says all four are correct. Wait, but the options given are A to J. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: (i), (ii), and (iv) only

B: (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)

C: (i), (ii), (iii) only

D: (iii) and (iv) only

E: (ii) and (iii) only

F: (i) and (iv) only

G: (i) and (iii) only

H: (i), (iii), and (iv) only

I: (ii) and (iv) only

J: (ii), (iii), and (iv) only

Wait, so option B includes all four (i, ii, iii, iv). So according to my analysis, all four should be correct, so B would be the answer.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again about statement (iii). The standard error is inversely proportional to sqrt(n). So when n increases, se_b decreases. So (iii) is correct because it's negative relation.

Yes, I think all four are correct, so option B is correct.

To determine which statements about the OLS estimator for the standard error of the slope coefficient are true, we analyze each statement based on the formula for the standard error of the slope coefficient:

\[
\text{se}_b = \frac{\text{residual standard error}}{\text{std}_x \cdot \sqrt{n}}
\]

- **Statement (i):** The standard error will be positively related to the residual variance.  
  The residual standard error is the square root of the residual variance. As residual variance increases, the residual standard error increases, which in turn increases the standard error of the slope coefficient. Therefore, (i) is true.

- **Statement (ii):** The standard error will be negatively related to the dispersion of the observations on the explanatory variable about their mean value.  
  The standard error is inversely proportional to the standard deviation of the explanatory variable (\(\text{std}_x\)). As the dispersion (variance or standard deviation) of \(x\) increases, the standard error decreases. Thus, (ii) is true.

- **Statement (iii):** The standard error will be negatively related to the sample size.  
  The standard error is inversely proportional to \(\sqrt{n}\). As the sample size \(n\) increases, the standard error decreases. Therefore, (iii) is true.

- **Statement (iv):** The standard error gives a measure of the precision of the coefficient estimate.  
  The standard error measures the variability of the slope coefficient across different samples. A smaller standard error indicates greater precision. Hence, (iv) is true.

Since all four statements (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) are correct, the correct option is:

**B: (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)**

Answer: B
