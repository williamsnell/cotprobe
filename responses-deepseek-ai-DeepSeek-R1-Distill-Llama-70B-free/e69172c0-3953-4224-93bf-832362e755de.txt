Okay, so I have this business problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again carefully.

Four friends started a business remodeling and selling old cars. They rented a barn for $600 for the summer. They got each car from a dealer for $250, and each car takes an average of $410 in materials to remodel. They want to know how many cars they need to sell at $1,440 each to get a gross profit of $7,000.

Hmm, right. So I remember that gross profit is calculated by subtracting the cost of goods sold (COGS) from the total revenue. So, Gross Profit = Total Revenue - COGS.

Wait, but what's included in COGS here? Well, COGS would be the direct costs related to producing the goods, which in this case are the cars. So each car has a cost of $250 to buy it from the dealer and $410 in materials. So per car, the COGS is 250 + 410 = $660.

But wait, there's also the barn rental of $600. Is that a fixed cost? I think so because it's not dependent on the number of cars. So, fixed costs are usually not part of COGS but are operating expenses. But wait, in some contexts, especially for calculating contribution margin, fixed costs might be handled separately. But for gross profit, COGS is variable costs, right? So the barn rental might be an operating expense, not part of COGS.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify. In accounting, COGS typically includes direct costs: material and labor. Overhead like rent might be considered an operating expense, not part of COGS. So in this case, the barn rental is probably a fixed cost and not part of COGS. So the COGS per car is $660.

So, for each car sold, the cost is $660, and the selling price is $1,440. So the gross profit per car is 1,440 - 660 = $780 per car.

Wait, but wait a second. The total fixed cost is $600, right? So the total costs would be fixed costs plus variable costs. But when calculating gross profit, it's total revenue minus COGS, which is variable. So the fixed costs are not included in COGS, but they are part of the overall expenses. However, the question is about gross profit, so I think the fixed costs are not subtracted in the gross profit calculation.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. Gross profit is total revenue minus COGS. COGS is the sum of all direct costs. So in this case, COGS per car is $250 (purchase) + $410 (materials) = $660. The barn rental is a fixed operating expense, so it's not part of COGS. So when calculating gross profit, we subtract only the COGS from the revenue. But the problem is asking for the number of cars needed to achieve a gross profit of $7,000.

So, let's model this. Let n be the number of cars sold.

Total revenue = n * 1,440.

Total COGS = n * 660.

Gross profit = Total revenue - COGS = 1,440n - 660n = 780n.

We're told that the gross profit needs to be $7,000. So 780n = 7,000.

Wait, that can't be right. Because 780 times 9 is 7,020, which is close to 7,000. Let me check the numbers again.

Wait, 1,440 - 660 = 780 per car. So 780n = 7,000. So n would be 7,000 / 780. Let me compute that.

7,000 ÷ 780. Let's see, 780 * 9 = 7,020. That's just over 7,000. So 9 cars would give 7,020 gross profit, which is a bit more than 7,000. But wait, the question is to obtain a gross profit of exactly 7,000. So perhaps n is 9, but let me check.

Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake. Because the total costs might include the barn rental. Wait, no, because COGS doesn't include fixed costs. So the gross profit is revenue minus COGS, which doesn't include the barn. So in that case, then 780n = 7,000, so n = 7,000 / 780 ≈ 8.97, which is about 9 cars. But since you can't sell a fraction of a car, you'd need to sell 9 cars to reach at least 7,000.

Wait, but wait again. Let me recheck the problem statement. The question is asking for a gross profit of $7,000. So gross profit is calculated as total revenue minus COGS. COGS is each car's cost, which is 250 + 410 = 660. So per car, the gross profit is 1,440 - 660 = 780.

So total gross profit is 780 * n = 7,000.

So solving for n: n = 7,000 / 780.

Let me calculate that. 780 * 9 = 7,020, which is 20 more than 7,000. So 8 cars would give 780 * 8 = 6,240, which is less than 7,000. 9 cars give 7,020, which is more than 7,000. But the question is to obtain a gross profit of exactly 7,000. Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps the fixed costs are being considered in the overall profit calculation, but the question is only about gross profit. So I think I was correct to exclude the fixed cost from COGS, so the calculation remains 780n = 7,000, leading to approximately 8.97 cars. Since you can't sell a fraction, you'd need to sell 9 cars to reach at least 7,000 in gross profit.

But looking at the answer options, option H is 9. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me double-check the setup. The total revenue is n * 1,440. The total COGS is n * 660. So gross profit is 1,440n - 660n = 780n. So 780n = 7,000 → n = 7,000 / 780 ≈ 8.97. So 9 cars. So the answer is H: 9.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the fixed cost is part of the COGS? No, that doesn't seem right. COGS is variable costs. So I think H is correct.

To determine how many automobiles the students must sell to achieve a gross profit of $7,000, we start by calculating the gross profit per car. The cost of goods sold (COGS) per car includes the purchase price from the dealer ($250) and the cost of materials ($410), totaling $660. The selling price per car is $1,440, so the gross profit per car is:

\[
\text{Gross Profit per Car} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{COGS} = \$1,440 - \$660 = \$780.
\]

Let \( n \) represent the number of cars sold. The total gross profit can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Total Gross Profit} = n \times \$780.
\]

The students aim for a total gross profit of $7,000. Setting up the equation:

\[
780n = 7,000.
\]

Solving for \( n \):

\[
n = \frac{7,000}{780} \approx 8.97.
\]

Since the number of cars sold must be a whole number, the students need to sell 9 cars to achieve a gross profit of at least $7,000. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**H: 9**
