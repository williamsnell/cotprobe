Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because thermodynamics isn't my strongest suit. But I'll give it a go.

The problem says that a strip of magnesium with a mass of 15 grams is placed in a beaker of dilute hydrochloric acid. I need to calculate the work done by the system as a result of the reaction. The conditions are atmospheric pressure of 1.0 atm and a temperature of 25 degrees Celsius.

Hmm, I remember that when a metal reacts with an acid, it's usually a single displacement reaction. Magnesium reacting with hydrochloric acid should produce magnesium chloride, hydrogen gas, and water. The reaction equation would look something like Mg(s) + 2HCl(aq) → MgCl₂(aq) + H₂(g). That makes sense because Mg is more reactive than H, so it displaces it.

Now, the key here is to find the work done by the system. I recall that in thermodynamics, work done by the system is often related to expansion work, especially when gases are involved. Since this reaction produces hydrogen gas, the system might be doing work on the surroundings by expanding against the atmospheric pressure.

So, to calculate work, I think the formula w = -P_ext * ΔV is used, where P_ext is the external pressure and ΔV is the change in volume. But wait, isn't work done by the system considered negative when the system is expanding? Or is it positive? Oh right, in the formula, work done by the system is negative because the system loses energy. But sometimes I get confused with the sign conventions. Let me think again. Oh, yes, when the system does work on the surroundings, the work is negative from the system's perspective.

But wait, another thought—when a gas is produced, the system is expanding, so it's doing work on the surroundings, which means the work is negative. So if I calculate the work, it should be a negative value, right?

Next, I need to find out how much hydrogen gas is produced. For that, I should calculate the moles of magnesium that reacted. The mass of Mg is 15 grams. The molar mass of Mg is about 24.3 g/mol. So moles of Mg = mass / molar mass = 15g / 24.3 g/mol ≈ 0.617 mol.

Looking at the balanced equation, the stoichiometry is 1 mole of Mg producing 1 mole of H₂. So moles of H₂ would be the same as moles of Mg, approximately 0.617 moles.

Now, I need to find the volume of this hydrogen gas. Since the reaction occurs at 25°C, which is 298 K, and the pressure is 1 atm, I can use the ideal gas law PV = nRT.

Wait, but the problem says to assume all gases are perfect, so ideal gas law applies. So let's plug in the numbers.

R is the ideal gas constant. I think I should use R in units that match pressure in atm. So R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K).

So P is 1 atm, n is 0.617 mol, T is 298 K, R is 0.0821. Let me calculate V.

V = nRT / P = (0.617 mol)(0.0821 L·atm/mol·K)(298 K) / 1 atm.

Calculating that: 0.617 * 0.0821 = approx 0.0506, then multiply by 298: 0.0506 * 300 ≈ 15.18, but since 298 is 2 less than 300, let's adjust. 0.0506 * 2 = 0.1012, so 15.18 - 0.1012 ≈ 15.08 liters. So about 15.08 L.

Wait, let me double-check that multiplication. 0.617 * 0.0821 is more accurately 0.05066. Then 0.05066 * 298. Let me compute 0.05 * 298 = 14.9 and 0.00066 * 298 ≈ 0.196. So total is around 15.096 liters, so approximately 15.1 L. That's the volume of H2 gas produced.

Now, the change in volume ΔV is the volume of the gas, assuming that the volume of the reactants (solid Mg and aqueous HCl) is negligible compared to the gas produced. So ΔV ≈ 15.1 L.

But wait, in the formula for work, the units are in joules. So I need to convert liters to cubic meters because 1 L = 0.001 m³. So 15.1 L = 0.0151 m³.

Now, pressure is given in atm, but I think the standard unit for pressure in the formula is pascals. 1 atm is 101325 Pa. So P_ext is 1 atm = 101325 Pa.

Putting it all together: w = -P_ext * ΔV.

So w = - (101325 Pa) * (0.0151 m³).

Calculating that: 101325 * 0.0151 = Let me compute that step by step.

101325 * 0.01 = 1013.25.

101325 * 0.005 = 506.625.

So 0.015 is 0.01 + 0.005, so 1013.25 + 506.625 = 1519.875.

But wait, it's 0.0151, which is 0.015 + 0.0001. So 0.0001 * 101325 is 10.1325.

So total is 1519.875 + 10.1325 = 1530.0075 J, which is approximately 1530 J.

But wait, the formula is w = - P_ext * ΔV. So the work done by the system is negative, so w = -1530 J. Which is -1.53 kJ.

Looking at the options, option A is -1.5 kJ, option H is -1.0 kJ. But wait, my calculation came to approximately -1.53 kJ, which is close to -1.5 kJ. So option A.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes when the system does work, it's considered negative. So if the system is expanding, the work done by the system is negative, which matches with the calculation.

But wait another thought: in some conventions, the work done by the system is taken as positive. Oh wait, no—the first law of thermodynamics states that work done by the system is negative. So our calculation correctly gives a negative value, so option A.

Wait, let me just check another angle. Is the volume change really just the volume of H2? Because the reaction produces H2 gas, and initially, there's no gas, so the change in volume is the volume of H2. So yes, that part's correct.

Wait another thing: the problem says the atmospheric pressure is 1.0 atm. So when the gas is formed, it's expanding against this pressure. So the work done is PΔV, and it's negative.

Yes, so the work done by the system is -1.53 kJ, which is approximately -1.5 kJ, so option A is correct.

To calculate the work done by the system, we analyze the reaction between magnesium and hydrochloric acid. The reaction is:

\[
\text{Mg(s)} + 2\text{HCl(aq)} \rightarrow \text{MgCl}_2\text{(aq)} + \text{H}_2\text{(g)}
\]

### Step 1: Moles of Magnesium
The mass of magnesium is 15 g, and its molar mass is 24.3 g/mol. The moles of magnesium are:

\[
n_{\text{Mg}} = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{molar mass}} = \frac{15}{24.3} \approx 0.617 \, \text{mol}
\]

From the stoichiometry of the reaction, 1 mole of Mg produces 1 mole of H₂. Therefore, the moles of H₂ produced are also:

\[
n_{\text{H}_2} = 0.617 \, \text{mol}
\]

### Step 2: Volume of Hydrogen Gas
Using the ideal gas law, \( PV = nRT \), we calculate the volume of H₂ gas at \( T = 298 \, \text{K} \) and \( P = 1.0 \, \text{atm} \). The ideal gas constant \( R \) is \( 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \). Solving for \( V \):

\[
V = \frac{nRT}{P} = \frac{(0.617)(0.0821)(298)}{1.0} \approx 15.1 \, \text{L}
\]

### Step 3: Work Done by the System
The work done by the system is given by:

\[
w = -P_{\text{ext}} \Delta V
\]

Here, \( P_{\text{ext}} = 1.0 \, \text{atm} = 101325 \, \text{Pa} \), and \( \Delta V = 15.1 \, \text{L} = 0.0151 \, \text{m}^3 \). Substituting:

\[
w = -(101325)(0.0151) \approx -1530 \, \text{J} = -1.53 \, \text{kJ}
\]

### Step 4: Final Answer
The work done by the system is approximately \( -1.5 \, \text{kJ} \), which corresponds to option **A**.
