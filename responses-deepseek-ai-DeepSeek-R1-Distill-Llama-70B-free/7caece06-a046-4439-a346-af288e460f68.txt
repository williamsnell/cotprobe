Okay, so I have this physics problem here about calculating the time average of the potential energy for a particle in an elliptical orbit under an inverse-square law force. Hmm, I remember that in such a force field, like gravitational or electrostatic, the potential energy is given by U = -k/r, where k is a constant and r is the distance from the center.

The question is about finding the average potential energy over one complete period. Wait, time average. I think for that, I need to integrate U over one orbital period and then divide by the period.

So the orbit is elliptical, with a semimajor axis 'a'. I remember that in Keplerian orbits, the semi-major axis relates to the orbital period. Oh right, Kepler's third law: T^2 = (4π²/GM) a³, but since this is an inverse-square force, maybe I can use some properties from that.

But wait, the force is inverse square, so maybe the potential is similar to gravitational. So the potential U is -k/r.

I also recall that for an elliptical orbit, the virial theorem might come into play. The virial theorem states that the average kinetic energy is -½ times the average potential energy. Wait, no, the average kinetic is half the magnitude of the average potential. So if the average potential is U_avg, then K_avg = -U_avg/2.

Wait, let me think again. The virial theorem for a potential U proportional to r⁻¹ (like here) says that the average kinetic energy is -½ times the average potential energy. So 2K_avg = -U_avg. So K_avg = - U_avg / 2.

But I'm being asked about the potential energy average, not the kinetic. So maybe that's a way to find it.

Alternatively, I should think about the total mechanical energy. For an orbit in an inverse-square field, the total energy E is given by E = -k/(2a), where a is the semi-major axis. Because I remember that for an elliptical orbit, the energy is negative and depends on 'a'.

Wait, yes. The formula is E = -k/(2a), where a is the semi-major axis. And E is the sum of kinetic and potential energy. So E = K_avg + U_avg.

But from the virial theorem, K_avg = - U_avg / 2. So substituting into E:

E = (- U_avg / 2) + U_avg = (U_avg) / 2.

But E is also equal to -k/(2a). So:

U_avg / 2 = -k/(2a)
Multiply both sides by 2:
U_avg = -k/(a)

Wait, that would give U_avg as -k/a. But let me check my steps.

Wait, E = K + U, where K is kinetic and U is potential. And from virial, 2K = -U. So K = -U/2.

So E = (-U/2) + U = U/2. So E = U/2.

So U = 2E. And E is -k/(2a), so U = 2*(-k/(2a)) ) = -k/a.

So the average potential energy is -k/a.

Looking at the options, option A is -k/a, so the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me think again. Because I'm not sure if I applied the virial theorem correctly. Another approach: parametrize the orbit.

In an elliptical orbit, the distance r varies as r = (a(1-e²))/(1 + e cosθ), where e is the eccentricity. The potential U is -k/r. To find the average, I'd have to integrate U over the period and divide by T.

The period T is 2π√(a³/(k/(m)) ), but wait, actually, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact expression. Alternatively, maybe using Kepler's third law which relates T² = (4π² a³)/(k m), but maybe I'm getting the constants wrong here.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that for an inverse-square force, the average value of 1/r over the orbit is 1/(a(1-e²)) multiplied by some factor. Hmm, I'm not too confident about that approach.

Wait, but I think the virial theorem approach is more straightforward. So if I stick with that, then the potential energy average is -k/a. So the answer should be option A.

To calculate the time average of the potential energy for a particle in an elliptical orbit under a central inverse-square-law force field, we start by noting that the potential energy is given by \( U = -\frac{k}{r} \), where \( k \) is the force constant and \( r \) is the distance from the center of the force field. The orbit is characterized by a semimajor axis \( a \), and we aim to express the result in terms of \( k \) and \( a \).

Using the virial theorem for a potential \( U \propto r^{-1} \), the average kinetic energy \( K_{\text{avg}} \) is related to the average potential energy \( U_{\text{avg}} \) by:

\[
K_{\text{avg}} = -\frac{U_{\text{avg}}}{2}.
\]

The total mechanical energy \( E \) of the orbit is the sum of the average kinetic and potential energies:

\[
E = K_{\text{avg}} + U_{\text{avg}}.
\]

Substituting \( K_{\text{avg}} = -\frac{U_{\text{avg}}}{2} \) into the expression for \( E \), we get:

\[
E = -\frac{U_{\text{avg}}}{2} + U_{\text{avg}} = \frac{U_{\text{avg}}}{2}.
\]

Thus, \( U_{\text{avg}} = 2E \). For an elliptical orbit in an inverse-square-law force field, the total energy is given by:

\[
E = -\frac{k}{2a}.
\]

Substituting this into \( U_{\text{avg}} = 2E \), we find:

\[
U_{\text{avg}} = 2 \left(-\frac{k}{2a}\right) = -\frac{k}{a}.
\]

Therefore, the time average of the potential energy is \( -\frac{k}{a} \), which corresponds to option A.
