Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about capillary rise and bubble pressure. Hmm, I remember that capillary action has to do with the height a liquid rises in a tube. The formula for capillary rise is h = (2γ cosθ)/(ρg r), where γ is surface tension, ρ is density, g is gravity, and r is the radius of the tube. Oh wait, and θ is the contact angle, which I think we can assume is the same here since the problem doesn't mention it changing.

So the problem says that for liquid A, the capillary rise is 1.0 cm at 25°C. Then, part a is asking about the rise for liquid B using the same capillary. The given information is that liquid A has half the surface tension of liquid B and twice the density. So let me break that down.

Let me write the variables:

For liquid A: γ_A = γ/2 (since it's half of B’s), ρ_A = 2ρ_B.

Because the same capillary is used, the radius r is the same for both. So when calculating the ratio of h_B to h_A, the r will cancel out.

So the formula for h is proportional to γ/(ρ). Because h ∝ γ/(ρ g r), but since g and r are same for both, the ratio h_B/h_A = (γ_B/ρ_B) / (γ_A/ρ_A).

Let's plug in the values. γ_B is twice γ_A, because A is half of B. So γ_B = 2γ_A. Similarly, ρ_A is twice ρ_B, so ρ_B = ρ_A / 2.

Wait, let me think. We have h_A = (2γ_A cosθ)/(ρ_A g r). Similarly, h_B = (2γ_B cosθ)/(ρ_B g r).

So h_B / h_A = ( (γ_B / ρ_B) ) / (γ_A / ρ_A )

We know γ_B = 2 γ_A. And ρ_A = 2 ρ_B. So let's substitute:

= ( (2 γ_A) / (ρ_B) ) / ( γ_A / (2 ρ_B) ) )

Wait, let me compute that. Let me write it:

Numerator: (2 γ_A) / ρ_B

Denominator: (γ_A) / (2 ρ_B)

So the ratio is [ (2 γ_A/ρ_B) ] / [ γ_A/(2 ρ_B) ) ] = [2 γ_A/ρ_B ] * [2 ρ_B / γ_A ]

The γ_A cancels, ρ_B cancels. 2 * 2 =4. So h_B/h_A =4. So h_B=4 h_A. Oh wait, because h_A is 1 cm, h_B would be 4 cm.

But wait, no, the question says that A has half the surface tension of B, so γ_A = (1/2) γ_B. So γ_B = 2 γ_A. And A's density is twice that of B, so ρ_A=2 ρ_B → ρ_B=ρ_A/2.

So when I plug in, h_B is proportional to (γ_B / ρ_B) = (2 γ_A) / (ρ_A/2) ) = (4 γ_A) / ρ_A.

And h_A is (γ_A / ρ_A ). So the ratio is (4 γ_A/ρ_A ) / ( γ_A/ρ_A ) ) =4. So yes, h_B is four times h_A. So part a) answer is h_B=4h_A.

Now part b) asks about the maximum bubble pressure. The maximum bubble pressure is the pressure exerted when a bubble forms at the end of the capillary. I think the formula is P = 2γ/r, assuming the contact angle is 180 degrees maybe, but wait, I'm a bit fuzzy here. Alternatively, maximum bubble pressure might be when the bubble is just forming, and the pressure inside the bubble is higher than the surrounding. So the formula is P = 4γ / (r), but I'm not entirely sure. Some sources say P = 2γ / r when the bubble is hemispherical. Wait, I remember that for a soap bubble, the pressure difference is 4γ/r, but maybe in this context it's different.

Wait, the capillary rise equation is h = (2γ cosθ)/(ρ g r), but for the bubble pressure, the excess pressure inside the bubble is given by the Young-Laplace equation. For a bubble with radius r, the pressure P is P = 2γ / r. Hmm, because a bubble has two surfaces (inner and outer), so ΔP = 4γ/r? Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think: for a soap bubble, the pressure difference is 4γ/r because there are two surfaces (inside and outside). But for a bubble against a liquid, perhaps it's just a hemisphere, so only one surface, so P = 2γ/r.

Wait, but the problem says "maximum bubble pressure", which I think refers to the pressure required to blow a bubble in the tube. So when the liquid is in the tube, and you apply pressure to create a bubble. The point at which the bubble begins to form is when the pressure equals the capillary pressure. So perhaps the maximum bubble pressure is the same as the capillary pressure, which is given by P = 2γ / r.

Wait, but another thought: the capillary pressure is the pressure difference across the meniscus. So in the capillary rise, the pressure difference is ρ g h = 2γ cosθ / (r). So if h = 2γ cosθ/(r ρ g), then ρ g h = 2γ cosθ / r → P = 2γ/(r), assuming cosθ is 1 (non-wetting, like mercury), but if it's wetting, cosθ would be positive. But wait, if the liquid wets the tube, then cosθ is positive, so the pressure inside the liquid is lower, but when blowing a bubble, perhaps it's the opposite.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The maximum bubble pressure is the pressure needed to just start forming a bubble, which is when the pressure equals the capillary pressure. So P = 2γ / r.

So for each liquid, their P is 2γ / r. So the ratio P_B / P_A = (γ_B / γ_A) * (r_A / r_B). But since the same tube is used, r is same, so r_A = r_B=r. So the ratio is γ_B / γ_A.

Given that γ_A is half of γ_B, so γ_B = 2 γ_A. So P_B / P_A = 2 γ_A / γ_A =2. So P_B =2 P_A. So the pressure for B is twice that of A.

So now, looking at the options, need to find an option where part a is h_B=4h_A and part b is pressure twice as much.

Looking at the options:

Option C: h_B=4h_A, pressure four times as much for B. No, because we got 2 times.

Option F: h_B=4h_A, pressure twice as much. Yes, that's what we have.

Wait, let's check all options.

Option A: h_B=2h_A, pressure half. No.

Option B: same as A, but pressure same. No.

Option C: 4h_A, pressure four times. No.

Option D: h is 1/4, pressure 3 times. No.

Option E: h_B=0.5, pressure same. No.

Option F: h_B=4h_A, pressure twice as much for B. Yes, matches.

Option G: h=3h_A, pressure 3 times. No.

Option H: h=0.5h_A, pressure 2 times. No.

Option I: h=3h_A, pressure half. No.

Option J: h same, pressure 4 times. No.

So the correct option is F.

Wait, but let me re-verify the bubble pressure. Earlier I thought P = 2γ/r. So for P_B, it's 2γ_B / r. For P_A, 2γ_A / r. So P_B / P_A = (2γ_B/r) / (2γ_A/r )= γ_B/γ_A = 2. So yes, twice as much. So the pressure for B is twice as much as A.

To solve the problem, we analyze the capillary rise and maximum bubble pressure using the given relationships between the properties of liquids A and B.

### Part (a): Capillary Rise
The formula for capillary rise is:

\[
h = \frac{2\gamma \cos\theta}{\rho g r}
\]

where \( \gamma \) is the surface tension, \( \rho \) is the density, \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity, \( r \) is the radius of the capillary, and \( \theta \) is the contact angle. Since the same capillary is used, \( r \), \( g \), and \( \cos\theta \) are constant for both liquids. Thus, the ratio of capillary heights is:

\[
\frac{h_B}{h_A} = \frac{\gamma_B / \rho_B}{\gamma_A / \rho_A}
\]

From the problem:
- \( \gamma_A = \frac{1}{2} \gamma_B \), so \( \gamma_B = 2 \gamma_A \),
- \( \rho_A = 2 \rho_B \), so \( \rho_B = \frac{\rho_A}{2} \).

Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{h_B}{h_A} = \frac{(2\gamma_A) / (\rho_A / 2)}{\gamma_A / \rho_A} = \frac{4\gamma_A / \rho_A}{\gamma_A / \rho_A} = 4
\]

Thus, \( h_B = 4h_A \). Since \( h_A = 1.0 \, \text{cm} \), \( h_B = 4.0 \, \text{cm} \).

### Part (b): Maximum Bubble Pressure
The maximum bubble pressure is given by the Young-Laplace equation:

\[
P = \frac{2\gamma}{r}
\]

Since the same capillary is used, \( r \) is constant. Therefore, the ratio of pressures is:

\[
\frac{P_B}{P_A} = \frac{\gamma_B}{\gamma_A}
\]

From the problem, \( \gamma_B = 2\gamma_A \). Thus:

\[
\frac{P_B}{P_A} = 2
\]

This means the maximum bubble pressure for liquid B is twice that for liquid A.

---

### Final Answer
From the analysis:
- \( h_B = 4h_A \),
- The maximum bubble pressure for liquid B is twice that for liquid A.

The correct option is:

**F: \( h_B = 4h_A \), the pressure will be twice as much for liquid B as for liquid A.**

The final answer is:

**F**
