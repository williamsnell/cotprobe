Okay, so I need to answer this multiple-choice question about human evolution. The question is asking which hominid had evolved by 1.8 million years ago. The options are from A to H, each representing a different species.

Hmm, I remember that human evolution has several key species. Let me think about the timeline. Australopithecus afarensis, like "Lucy," was around much earlier, maybe 3-4 million years ago. So option A is probably not the right answer.

Then there's Homo habilis, which I think was the first to use tools, but I don't see that as an option here. Moving forward in time, Homo erectus comes next. I recall that Homo erectus lived around 1.8 million years ago and was one of the first to migrate out of Africa. That sounds like it fits the question.

Wait, let me make sure. Other options include Homo heidelbergensis, which I think was around 600,000 years ago, leading to both Neanderthals and Homo sapiens. So G is probably not the correct answer here.

Homo sapiens are modern humans, so they came much later, around 300,000 years ago. Option F is out. Neanderthals, options C and D, were around more like 400,000 to 40,000 years ago, so not 1.8 million.

Homo floresiensis is the "hobbit" found in Indonesia, and they were much later, maybe 100,000 to 60,000 years ago. So E is not right. Homo naledi is a more recent discovery, but I think they're from around 236,000 to 335,000 years ago, so B isn't correct either.

So by 1.8 million years ago, Homo erectus had evolved. That would be option H.

The correct answer is H: Homo erectus.
