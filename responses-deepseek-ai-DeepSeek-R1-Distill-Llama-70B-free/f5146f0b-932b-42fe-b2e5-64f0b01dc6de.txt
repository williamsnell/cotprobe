Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Leopold Pospisil's four elements of law. I'm a bit rusty on my legal anthropology, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that Pospisil identifies four elements: authority, universality, 'obligatio', and a fourth one which I need to find from the options. The options are A to J, with each being a different term.

First, I remember that Pospisil was a legal anthropologist who studied the structure of legal systems, especially in stateless societies. His work focused on what makes a rule part of the legal system rather than just a social norm. He proposed that for a rule to be considered legal, it must have certain characteristics.

I think the four elements he identified are: authority, universality, obligatio, and something else. Let me break them down. 

1. **Authority**: This refers to the source of the rule. Legal rules must be established by someone with the authority to make them, like a leader or institution.

2. **Universality**: The rule applies to everyone in the society or group. It's not just a personal rule but something that's intended to apply broadly.

3. **Obligatio**: This is the idea that the rule is binding. People are obligated to follow it, and there's an expectation of compliance.

Now, the fourth element... I'm a bit stuck. I think it's related to what happens when the rule is broken. Maybe enforcement or consequences?

Looking at the options provided:

A: Integrity. That doesn't ring a bell. I don't think that's one of the elements.

B: Hierarchy. Maybe, but I'm not sure. Hierarchy relates more to the structure of authority, which might be part of 'authority' already.

C: Dispute. Hmm, perhaps related to how laws are used to resolve disputes, but I don't think that's the element itself.

D: Justice. That's a broader concept, not sure if it's the fourth element.

E: Harmony. Sounds more like a goal of law rather than an element.

F: Regulation. That's a bit vague; laws do regulate, but I'm not sure if that's the term Pospisil used.

G: Punishment. This could fit because it's about the consequences of breaking the law. Sanctions often involve punishment.

H: Sanction. Oh, wait, I think this is it. Sanction refers to the enforcement partâ€”so if you don't follow the rule, there's a negative sanction (punishment), and sometimes positive sanctions (rewards) for compliance.

I: Order. Maybe, but I think that's more of an outcome of law rather than an element.

J: Equality. Not sure; equality is a principle in law, but not one of the four elements as per Pospisil.

Wait, I'm a bit confused between G and H. Punishment is a type of sanction, but the broader term is 'sanction'. So Pospisil's fourth element is probably 'sanction' because it includes both positive and negative enforcement.

So putting it all together, the four elements are authority, universality, obligatio, and sanction. Therefore, the answer should be H: Sanction.

The four elements of law identified by Leopold Pospisil are authority, universality, obligatio, and sanction. Sanction refers to the enforcement mechanism, ensuring compliance through consequences or rewards. 

Answer: H
