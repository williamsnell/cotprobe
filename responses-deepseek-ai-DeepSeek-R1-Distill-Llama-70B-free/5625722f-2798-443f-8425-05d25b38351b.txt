Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Source 1:
"Moreover, Sir, in our Kingdoms there is another great inconvenience which is of little service to God, and this is that many of our people, keenly desirous as they are of the wares and things of your Kingdoms, which are brought here by your people, and in order to satisfy their voracious appetite, seize many of our people, freed and exempt men, and very often it happens that they kidnap even noblemen and our relatives, and take them to be sold to the white men who are in our kingdoms."
Letter from King Afonso I of Kongo to King John III of Portugal, 1526
Source 2:
"This expedition has cost us much: it would be unreasonable to send it home with empty hands. Although our [principal] wish is to serve God and the pleasure of the king of Kongo, none the less you will make him understand—as though speaking in our name—what he should do to fill the ships, whether with slaves, or copper, or ivory."
Instructions from King Manuel of Portugal to his envoy in Kongo, 1512

A: Diplomatic relations between Portugal and Kongo were often cordial.

Okay, so I've got this history question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question gives me two sources, both letters from the 16th century involving the Kingdom of Kongo and Portugal. I need to read them carefully and then determine which conclusion is best supported by both.

Source 1 is a letter from King Afonso I of Kongo to King John III of Portugal in 1526. He's talking about a problem in their kingdoms. He says that many of his people are really eager to get goods from Portugal, which are brought by Portuguese traders. Because of this desire, their own people are seizing others—freed men, nobles, even relatives—and selling them to the white men (Portuguese) in Kongo. So, Afonso is complaining about his people being kidnapped and sold into slavery, which suggests that the Portuguese are involved in the slave trade here, and it's causing internal issues.

Source 2 is from earlier, 1512, and it's instructions from King Manuel of Portugal to his envoy in Kongo. He says that the expedition has cost a lot, so it's unreasonable to send the ships back empty. The main goal is to serve God and please the king of Kongo, but the envoy needs to make the king understand what he should do to fill the ships. The options are slaves, copper, or ivory. So, the Portuguese are expecting to get these goods, including slaves, from Kongo.

Now, the question is asking which conclusion is best supported by both sources. The options are A through D.

Option A: Diplomatic relations were often cordial. Hmm, looking at Source 1, Afonso is complaining about his people being seized and sold, which suggests some tension. Source 2 shows Portugal wanting to take slaves, which might not be so friendly. So maybe relations weren't that cordial. I'm not sure yet, but I'll keep this in mind.

Option B: Kongolese nobles were taken as slaves by Portuguese. Source 1 says that nobles and relatives are being taken, but does it say the Portuguese are doing it directly? Or is it Kongolese people selling their own? The letter says "seize many of our people... and take them to be sold to the white men." So, the white men are the buyers, but the seizing is done by Kongolese. So, the Portuguese are the ones buying, not necessarily the ones taking them. So, maybe B isn't the best answer because it's implying Portuguese took them, which the source doesn't exactly say.

Option C: Trade was highly regulated. Source 2 shows Portugal giving instructions to get goods, but does it say anything about regulations? Not really. Source 1 talks about unauthorized seizures, suggesting that the trade wasn't well-regulated because people were acting on their own to get goods. So maybe C isn't correct.

Option D: Trade was brisk with both parties. Source 2 mentions that the ships need to be filled, implying a lot of goods were being transported. Source 1 talks about a high demand for Portuguese goods, which led to the problem of people being taken. So, if there's a brisk trade, that means a lot of activity. So both sources suggest that trade was active, even if it had issues. So D might be the answer.

Wait, but what about the nature of the trade? Source 1 indicates that the trade in slaves was causing problems, but Source 2 shows that Portugal was actively seeking slaves. So, the trade was brisk, but perhaps not in a good way. However, the question is about what the sources best support, not whether the trade was positive or negative.

So, putting it together. Source 1 shows that the Kongolese were selling their own people to the Portuguese, which created internal issues. Source 2 shows Portugal actively seeking to get goods, including slaves. So, the trade was indeed happening, and both were participating—Portugal buying, Kongo providing goods. So, the trade was brisk, meaning active and busy, between both parties.

Looking back at the options, D says "Trade between Portugal and Kongo was brisk with both parties." That seems to fit because both sources indicate active trade, even if it's problematic.

So, I think the correct answer is D.

The two sources provide insight into the trade dynamics between Portugal and the Kingdom of Kongo in the early 16th century. Source 1, a letter from King Afonso I of Kongo, highlights the internal strife caused by the desire for Portuguese goods, leading to the seizure and sale of Kongolese people, including nobles, to Portuguese traders. This indicates that the trade was active but problematic. Source 2, from King Manuel of Portugal, explicitly states the expectation to fill ships with goods such as slaves, copper, or ivory, showing Portugal's active engagement in this trade.

Analyzing the options:

- **A** is incorrect because the letters suggest tension rather than cordial relations, as Afonso complains about the seizing of his people.
- **B** is misleading because while Kongolese nobles were taken, it was Kongolese individuals who seized them, not the Portuguese directly.
- **C** is incorrect as there is no evidence of highly regulated trade; instead, the sources imply unregulated or problematic trade practices.
- **D** is correct because both sources indicate active trade between the two kingdoms, with Portugal seeking goods and Kongo supplying them, even if the trade had negative consequences.

Thus, the best-supported conclusion is that trade between Portugal and Kongo was brisk with both parties involved.

Answer: D
