Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about attentional load theory. Hmm, I remember that attentional load theory is one of those theories in cognitive psychology that explains how we allocate attention. Let me try to recall what I learned.

Wait, attentional load theory... I think it's related to how much processing a task requires. So, the idea is that when a task requires a lot of attentional resources (high load), it affects how much we can process other stimuli. Oh right, because our attentional resources are limited.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. 

Option A says the processing of an attended stimulus depends on the ignored one. I'm not sure. I think it's the other way around. Attentional load is about the demands of the task you're attending to.

Option B talks about the number of tasks. That sounds more like task switching or divided attention, not load theory specifically. Load theory is more about the difficulty or demands of the task, not just the number.

Option C mentions the unity of actions limiting resources. Unity might relate to how we can only do one thing at a time, but I don't recall that being the main point of load theory. It's more about the capacity based on task demands.

Option D says the capacity is determined by the ignored stimulus's complexity. Wait, no. Load theory is about the attended task's complexity affecting the resources, not the ignored one.

Option E suggests selective attention delays ignored processing. I think selective attention might actually suppress the processing of ignored stimuli, not just delay it. So maybe not E.

Option F claims resources are limitless. No, that's definitely wrong. Attentional resources are limited, that's a core concept.

Option G states there's a general limit to attentional resources. That sounds right. Attentional load theory does say that when the load is high, there's less spare capacity to process other things, implying a general limit.

Option H says ignored processing depends on the attended. Oh wait, this sounds similar to option A but reversed. I think H is correct according to load theory. Because when the attended task requires more processing (high load), less attention is left for the ignored stimuli. So the extent to which ignored stimuli are processed depends on how much the attended task is using.

Option I mentions inhibition of return. I think that's a different concept, more about how attention shifts and avoids where it just was. Not directly about load theory.

Option J says ignored stimulus processing affects the attended. Wait, no, I think it's the other way around. The attended task's load affects how much ignored stuff is processed. So J is the opposite.

So now I'm a bit confused. Let's clarify. The theory says that when the attended task is high in load (requires more processing), the ignored stimuli are processed less. So the processing of ignored stimuli depends on how much the attended task is taking. That aligns with option H.

Wait, but option A says the attended depends on ignored. So H and A are opposites. I think the correct statement is that the ignored's processing depends on the attended. So H would be correct.

But wait, another point. The theory posits that if the load is high, the processing of ignored stimuli is reduced. So when the attended task requires more processing (high load), the ignored stimuli are less processed. So the extent to which ignored stimuli are processed depends on the attended task's processing load. That's H.

Yes, I think H is correct. So looking back at the options, the correct answer should be H.

Attentional load theory suggests that the processing of ignored stimuli depends on the extent of processing required by the attended stimulus. When the attended task has a high attentional load, fewer resources are available for processing ignored stimuli. This aligns with option H, which states, "The degree to which an ignored stimulus is processed depends on the extent of processing required by the attended stimulus." 

Other options were considered but found to be inconsistent with the theory. For example, option A incorrectly reverses the relationship, and option J also misrepresents the direction of influence. Option G, while partially correct about a general limit to attentional resources, does not specifically address the relationship between attended and ignored stimuli. Therefore, the correct answer is:

H

Answer: H
