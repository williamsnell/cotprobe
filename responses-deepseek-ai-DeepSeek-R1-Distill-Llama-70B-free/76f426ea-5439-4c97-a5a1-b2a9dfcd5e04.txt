Question:

A 44-year-old woman with a 10-year history of arthritis comes to the office because she has had increasing pain and stiffness in her hands, wrists, and knees during the past several months. She also has had increasing fatigue for the past month, along with a weight loss of 1.8 to 2.2 kg (4 to 5 lb). She has seen numerous physicians for her arthritis in the past and has tried various medications and devices, including copper bracelets from Mexico given to her by friends. Review of her medical records confirms that the initial diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis is correct. She says, "I had several drop attacks during the past 3 months." She characterizes these attacks as episodes of weakness and loss of feeling in her legs for several minutes. During one of these episodes, she became incontinent. She currently takes aspirin approximately four times daily and ibuprofen occasionally. Physical examination shows facial plethora and swollen and painful metacarpophalangeal and knee joints, bilaterally. There is moderate ulnar deviation of the fingers. The remainder of the examination discloses no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her "drop attacks?"

Options:

A: Side effect of the copper bracelets
B: Spinal stenosis
C: Reaction to aspirin or ibuprofen
D: Cardiac arrhythmia
E: Anxiety
F: Neurological side effects of rheumatoid arthritis
G: Transient ischemic attack
H: Adrenal insufficiency
I: Hypoglycemia
J: Atlanto-axial instability

Okay, so I've got this medical question to tackle, and I'm going to think through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The patient is a 44-year-old woman with a 10-year history of arthritis. She's having increasing pain and stiffness in her hands, wrists, and knees. Also, she's experienced fatigue and weight loss recently. She's tried various treatments, including copper bracelets, which I remember some people use thinking they help with arthritis, but I'm not sure if they actually do anything.

Her medical records confirm she has rheumatoid arthritis. Now, the key part is her "drop attacks." She describes these as episodes of weakness and loss of feeling in her legs, lasting several minutes. During one episode, she became incontinent. That's concerning. She's taking aspirin and ibuprofen. On physical exam, facial plethora, swollen joints, ulnar deviation. No other abnormalities.

The question is asking what's the most likely cause of her drop attacks. The options are A through J.

First, I need to understand what drop attacks are. I think drop attacks are sudden falls without loss of consciousness. They can be due to various reasons, like neurological issues or other systemic causes.

Looking at her history: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA). RA can have various complications beyond the joints, like affecting the spine or nerves. Also, she's on NSAIDs like aspirin and ibuprofen, but I don't recall these causing drop attacks.

Option A: Side effect of copper bracelets. I'm not aware of copper causing such symptoms. Plus, they're more of a placebo, so probably not.

Option B: Spinal stenosis. Spinal stenosis can cause pain and weakness, but does it cause sudden drop attacks? Maybe, but I'm not sure. It's usually more of a gradual issue.

Option C: Reaction to aspirin or ibuprofen. NSAIDs can cause GI issues, maybe even dizziness, but drop attacks? I don't think that's a common side effect.

Option D: Cardiac arrhythmia. Arrhythmias can cause syncope, which is a fainting spell. But she describes loss of feeling and weakness in legs, and she became incontinent once. Syncope usually doesn't cause loss of feeling or incontinence, unless it's a seizure, but that's different.

Option E: Anxiety. Anxiety can cause various symptoms, but I don't think it would cause drop attacks with loss of leg sensation and incontinence. Panic attacks might make you feel weak, but incontinence is more a sign of a neurological issue.

Option F: Neurological side effects of RA. RA can cause neurological symptoms. For example, if the cervical spine is involved, like atlanto-axial instability. That can lead to spinal cord compression, causing sudden weakness. But wait, that's more about the spine. Alternatively, RA can cause peripheral neuropathy, but drop attacks seem more central.

Option G: Transient ischemic attack (TIA). A TIA could cause sudden weakness, but TIAs usually don't cause loss of feeling in the legs specifically, and incontinence isn't a typical feature. Plus, the episodes last several minutes, which is possible for TIAs, but the incontinence makes me think of something more related to spinal issues.

Option H: Adrenal insufficiency. That usually causes fatigue, weight loss, low blood pressure. Could lead to dizziness or fainting, but again, incontinence and loss of leg feeling don't fit as well.

Option I: Hypoglycemia. Low blood sugar can cause confusion, sweating, and even loss of consciousness, but again, the specific leg symptoms and incontinence don't align perfectly.

Option J: Atlanto-axial instability. This is a condition where the joint between the atlas (C1) and axis (C2) in the neck is unstable. It's a known complication in RA because the inflammation can erode the ligaments and bones in the cervical spine. This instability can lead to compression of the spinal cord. When the neck moves in a certain way, it can cause sudden compression, leading to drop attacks. The symptoms she describes—weakness, loss of feeling, incontinence—could be due to spinal cord compression. Incontinence suggests autonomic nervous system involvement, which can happen with spinal cord issues.

So, putting it all together: the patient has RA, which can cause atlanto-axial instability. This condition can lead to episodes where the spinal cord is compressed, resulting in sudden weakness and neurological symptoms. The fact that during one episode she became incontinent supports a neurological cause affecting the spinal cord.

The patient is a 44-year-old woman with a 10-year history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), presenting with increasing pain, stiffness, fatigue, and weight loss. She reports "drop attacks" characterized by weakness, loss of feeling in her legs, and incontinence during one episode. Her medication includes aspirin and ibuprofen, and physical examination shows signs consistent with RA, such as ulnar deviation and swollen joints.

The key to determining the cause of her drop attacks lies in her history of RA, which can have systemic complications, including neurological and spinal involvement. RA can lead to atlanto-axial instability, a condition where the joint between the C1 and C2 vertebrae becomes unstable due to inflammation and erosion of ligaments and bones. This instability can compress the spinal cord, particularly during certain neck movements, resulting in sudden weakness, loss of sensation, and autonomic symptoms like incontinence. These symptoms align with the spinal cord compression caused by atlanto-axial instability.

Other options, such as spinal stenosis (B), cardiac arrhythmia (D), or transient ischemic attack (G), do not fully explain the combination of symptoms, particularly the incontinence and specific leg involvement. Side effects of medications (C), copper bracelets (A), anxiety (E), adrenal insufficiency (H), and hypoglycemia (I) are also less likely based on the presentation.

Thus, the most likely cause of her drop attacks is atlanto-axial instability secondary to RA.
