Okay, so I have this problem where I need to design a steel bar to withstand an axial load using Euler's formula, considering a factor of safety. Hmm, I remember Euler's formula is related to critical loads for columns, right? The formula is something like P = (π² E I) / (n² L²), but wait, I think I might be mixing it up. Oh wait, Euler's critical load is P_cr = (π² E I) / (L²) for a column with both ends hinged. But here, the problem says to base it on the Euler load, so I'll go with that.

The given axial load is 5500 lbs, but we have a factor of safety (FS) of 2.5. So the actual allowable load would be P_allowable = P_applied / FS. Wait, no, wait. No, actually, the factor of safety is the ratio of the critical load to the allowable load. So P_allowable = P_critical / FS. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. Factor of safety is usually the ratio of the material's strength to the allowable stress. But in Euler's case, the critical load is the maximum load before failure. So with a factor of safety, the allowable load would be P_allowable = P_critical / FS. So the applied load must be less than or equal to P_allowable.

Wait, no, wait. The question says the column needs to withstand an axial load of 5500 lbs, so that's the load it's subjected to. So using the factor of safety, the Euler load (critical load) must be higher than that. So the formula would be P_critical = FS * P_applied. Because if the critical load is the maximum before failure, then to have a safety factor, the critical load needs to be higher than the applied load. So P_critical = 2.5 * 5500 = 13750 lbs.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm mixing it up. Another approach: The allowable load is the applied load, which is 5500 lbs. So P_allowable = 5500 lbs. The critical load is P_critical = FS * P_allowable. So P_critical = 2.5 * 5500 = 13750 lbs.

So then, using Euler's formula, P_critical = (π² E I) / (L²). So we can rearrange this to solve for I, the moment of inertia. I = P_critical * L² / (π² E).

I need to find the moment of inertia for the steel bar. Assuming it's a solid circular bar, the moment of inertia I = (π d^4)/64, where d is the outer diameter.

Wait, but I think for a solid circular rod, the moment of inertia is I = (π d^4)/64. Yes, that's right.

So I can set up the equation: (π² E I) / L² = P_critical. So substituting I gives:

(π² E (π d^4 /64 )) / L² = P_critical.

Simplify that:

(π^3 E d^4 ) / (64 L²) ) = P_critical.

Wait, no, let me do that again. Euler's formula is P_cr = (π² E I) / (L²). So substituting I for a solid rod:

P_cr = (π² E (π d^4 /64 )) / L².

Wait, no, wait. Let me write it correctly. I = (π d^4)/64, so substituting into P_cr:

P_cr = (π² E) / L² * (π d^4 /64) = (π^3 E d^4) / (64 L²).

Wait, but that would make the equation P_cr = (π^3 E d^4) / (64 L²). Hmm, that seems a bit high in terms of the exponents, but maybe that's correct.

Wait, I think I might have messed up the substitution. Let me double-check. I = π d^4 /64 for a solid rod. So substituting into Euler's formula:

P_cr = (π² E I) / L².

So I is (π d^4)/64, so:

P_cr = (π² E) * (π d^4 /64) / L².

So that's (π^3 E d^4) / (64 L²).

Wait, that's correct. So solving for d:

d^4 = (P_cr *64 L²) / (π^3 E).

So d = [ (P_cr *64 L²) / (π^3 E) ]^(1/4).

Now, I need to plug in the numbers. Let's list the variables:

P_critical = 13750 lbs.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, earlier I thought P_critical is 2.5 * 5500. Let me confirm: Factor of safety is 2.5, so the critical load is 2.5 times the applied load. Because the applied load is 5500, so P_critical = 2.5 * 5500 = 13750 lb.

Yes.

Then, Length L is 222 inches.

E, the modulus of elasticity for steel. I think it's 29,000,000 psi, or 29e6 psi.

So E = 29e6 psi.

Putting it all into the equation:

d^4 = (13750 lb * 64 * (222 in)^2) / (π^3 * 29e6 psi).

Wait, but wait—the units have to be consistent. Because P is in pounds, E is in psi (lb/in²), and L is in inches. So let me check the units.

Let me compute each part step by step.

Calculate numerator:

P_cr = 13750 lb.

Multiply by 64: 13750 * 64 = let's compute that.

13750 * 60 = 825,000.

13750 *4=55,000.

Total: 880,000 lb.

Then multiply by L squared: 222^2 = 49284 in².

So numerator becomes 880,000 lb * 49284 in².

Wait, that's a huge number. Let me compute it:

880,000 * 49,284.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute in parts.

First, 880,000 * 49,284 = ?

Well, 8.8e5 * 4.9284e4 = 8.8 *4.9284 = let me compute 8*4.9284=39.4272, 0.8*4.9284=3.9427, total 43.3699. So 43.3699e9, which is 4.33699e10.

Wait, I think I messed up the exponents. Let me try again. 880,000 is 8.8e5, 49,284 is 4.9284e4.

Multiplying 8.8e5 *4.9284e4 = (8.8 *4.9284) * 1e9.

8.8 *4.9284:

8 *4.9284 = 39.4272

0.8 *4.9284 = 3.94272

Total: 39.4272 +3.94272=43.36992.

So 43.36992e9, which is 4.336992e10.

So the numerator is 4.336992e10 lb·in².

Denominator is π^3 * E = π^3 *29e6 psi.

Compute π^3: π is about 3.1416, so π^3 ≈ 31.006.

So denominator is 31.006 *29e6 = let's compute that.

31.006 *29 = 900.174.

So denominator is 900.174e6 lb/in².

Wait, because E is in psi, which is lb/in².

Wait, but the denominator is π^3 * E, so units are (lb/in²).

Wait, no, the units in the formula for d^4 are:

The entire equation is d^4 = [P_cr *64 * L² ] / [π^3 E ]

So the units are:

P_cr is in lb, L^2 is in^2, E is in lb/in².

So the units for the numerator: lb * in².

Denominator: (lb/in²).

So overall, (lb * in²) / (lb/in²) )= in^4.

Which is correct because d^4 is in^4.

So putting it together:

d^4 = (4.336992e10 lb·in²) / (900.174e6 lb/in²) )

So 4.336992e10 / 900.174e6 = let's compute that.

4.336992e10 / 9.00174e8 = (4.336992 / 9.00174) * 1e2.

4.336992 /9.00174 ≈ 0.4815.

So 0.4815 *1e2 =48.15.

So d^4 =48.15 in^4.

Take the fourth root to find d.

d = (48.15)^(1/4).

Hmm, what's the fourth root of 48.15?

I know that 2^4=16, 3^4=81. So 48.15 is between 2.7^4 and 2.8^4.

Let's compute 2.7^4: 2.7^2=7.29; 7.29^2=53.14, which is higher than 48.15.

Wait, wait, 2.7^4 is (2.7²)² =7.29²=53.14.

Wait, but 2.6^4: 2.6^2=6.76, 6.76^2=45.6976. So 45.7 is less than 48.15.

So d^4=48.15 → d is between 2.6 and 2.7.

Compute 2.65^4:

2.65^2=7.0225.

7.0225^2= approx 49.32, which is higher than 48.15.

So 2.65^4=49.32.

Hmm, but we have 48.15, so a bit less than 2.65.

Let me try 2.63:

2.63^2 = approx 6.9169.

6.9169^2 = approx 47.83.

That's close to 48.15. So 2.63^4≈47.83, which is a bit less than 48.15.

So the actual value is about 2.64 inches.

Wait, wait, let's compute more accurately.

Let me compute 2.63^4:

2.63 *2.63 = ?

2 *2=4, 2*.63=1.26, .63*2=1.26, .63*.63=0.3969.

So 4 +1.26 +1.26 +0.3969 =6.9169.

Then 6.9169^2: 6*6=36, 6*0.9169=5.5014, 0.9169*6=5.5014, 0.9169^2≈0.8407.

So 36 +5.5014 +5.5014 +0.8407 =47.8435.

So 2.63^4=47.8435.

We have d^4=48.15.

So the difference is 48.15-47.8435=0.3065.

How much more than 2.63 is needed to get to 48.15?

Assuming linear approximation:

The derivative of x^4 is 4x^3.

At x=2.63, dx= (0.3065)/(4*(2.63)^3).

Compute (2.63)^3: 2.63 *2.63=6.9169, *2.63≈6.9169*2=13.8338, 6.9169*0.63≈4.358, total≈18.1918.

So 4*(2.63)^3≈4*18.1918≈72.767.

So dx≈0.3065/72.767≈0.0042.

So x≈2.63 +0.0042≈2.6342 inches.

So d≈2.634 inches.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are in fractions. Let me see:

The options are:

A: 1 5/8" =1.625"

B:2"

C:1.5"

D:1.75"

E:2.25"

F:1.25"

G:2.5"

H:1.875"

I:1.6875" (1 11/16")

J:1.4375" (1 7/16")

Wait, none of the options are near 2.63 inches. Hmm, that's confusing. The closest would be option E:2.25", but that's less than 2.63. Or option G:2.5", which is closer.

Wait, but wait a minute. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me go back.

Euler's formula is P_cr = (π² E I) / (L²).

I used I for a solid rod, which is (π d^4)/64.

Wait, but some textbooks use I for a thin-walled tube, but in this case, it's a solid bar, so the formula is correct.

Wait, but maybe I messed up the calculation somewhere. Let's recheck.

Compute d^4 = (P_cr *64 * L²) / (π^3 E).

P_cr is 13750 lb.

64 is unitless.

L is 222 inches.

E is 29e6 psi.

So let's compute numerator: 13750 *64 * (222)^2.

Compute 222 squared: 222 *222. Let me compute 200^2=40000, 22^2=484, and cross terms: 2*200*22=8800. So (200+22)^2=40000 +8800 +484=49284. So correct.

So 13750 *64 = 880,000.

880,000 *49284 = let me compute 8.8e5 *4.9284e4.

8.8 *4.9284 = let's compute 8 *4.9284=39.4272, 0.8*4.9284=3.94272. Sum: 43.36992.

So 43.36992e9 = 4.336992e10.

Denominator: π^3 *29e6.

π^3 ≈31.006, so 31.006 *29e6= 900.174e6.

So d^4=4.336992e10 /900.174e6 = (4.336992/900.174) *1e4.

Wait, wait wait, no. Let me compute 4.336992e10 / 900.174e6.

Which is (4.336992e10) / (9.00174e8) ) = (4.336992 /9.00174) *1e2.

4.336992 /9.00174 ≈0.4815.

So 0.4815 *1e2 =48.15.

So d^4=48.15 in^4.

So d= (48.15)^(0.25)≈2.634 inches, as before.

But looking at the options, the largest is G:2.5", which is 2.5 inches.

Hmm, but 2.5" is less than 2.634", which suggests that the critical load would be less than the required. So maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the formula for I. Let me check: for a solid rod, I is (π d^4)/64. Alternatively, sometimes it's expressed as (π (d^4 - d_i^4))/64 for a hollow tube, but here it's solid, so I is correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. Did I remember Euler's formula correctly? I think for a column with both ends hinged, the formula is P_cr = (π² E I)/(L²).

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the factor of safety. The question says factor of safety is 2.5. So P_critical = P_allowable * FS.

Wait, no, the factor of safety is applied to the load. So P_allowable = P_applied / FS.

Wait, wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of stresses. The critical stress is σ_cr = P_cr / A.

And the allowable stress would be σ_allowable = σ_cr / FS.

But in this problem, perhaps we're using the applied load as P_allowable, so P_critical = FS * P_allowable.

Yes, earlier approach was correct.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake with the value of E? Maybe I used E as 29e6 psi, but perhaps it's different. Wait, for steel, E is about 29,000,000 psi, yes.

Wait, let me try a different approach. Maybe I should compute the radius of gyration and use that.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula for I. Alternatively, maybe the column is considered as a different end condition.

Wait, the problem doesn't specify the end conditions, so I assumed both ends are hinged, which gives the Euler formula I used. But if the column has fixed ends, the critical load would be higher. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify, so I have to go with the assumption of hinged ends.

Hmm, but let me think again. If I'm getting a diameter larger than any of the options, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I used P_critical = FS * P_applied, but maybe it's the other way around. Let me think about factors of safety again.

Factor of safety (FS) is defined as the ratio of the ultimate strength to the allowable strength. So if the material's ultimate strength is Su, then the allowable stress is Su / FS.

In this case, the Euler critical load is the maximum load before failure, which would correspond to the ultimate load. So the allowable load would be P_allowable = P_critical / FS.

But the problem states that the column must withstand 5500 lbs, which would be the allowable load. So:

P_allowable = 5500 lb = P_critical / FS.

So P_critical = 5500 lb * FS = 5500 *
