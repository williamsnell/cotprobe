Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

If you rub your eyes long and hard enough, you would eventuallysee some type of visual pattern. Explain this phenomenon.

Options:

A: The rubbing action generates light inside the eye
B: Pressure on the eye temporarily alters the shape of the cornea, leading to distorted visual signals.
C: The mechanical stimulation from rubbing triggers a reflex that causes the pupils to dilate and create patterned visuals.
D: Friction from rubbing generates heat, which causes the illusion of light patterns.
E: It happens due to the production of a natural hallucinogen when pressure is applied
F: The pressure causes the release of stored light energy in the eye
G: The pressure exerted on the eye stimulates the receptor nerve cells at the back of the retina, which normally respond to light, and their response to this pressure, when communicated to the visual area of the brain, produce the experience of light.
H: Rubbing the eyes causes a temporary change in blood flow to the visual cortex, resulting in visual phenomena.
I: The rubbing motion activates latent photoreceptor cells which produce the visual patterns.
J: The optic nerve is temporarily disoriented by the rubbing, resulting in random visual patterns.

Okay, so I've got this question about why you see visual patterns when you rub your eyes hard. Hmm, I remember that when I rub my eyes, especially when I'm tired, I see all these colorful spots or patterns. But why does that happen?

Let me think about how the eye works. The eye has the retina at the back, which has photoreceptor cells like rods and cones. These cells are supposed to detect light and send signals to the brain via the optic nerve. So when light hits them, they send signals, and we see things.

But when you rub your eyes, you're applying pressure. Maybe that pressure is affecting the photoreceptor cells somehow. I've heard before that pressure can cause the cells to fire without light. Oh wait, isn't that how some people can see stars when they press their eyes? Like, the mechanical pressure triggers the cells even without light entering.

Looking at the options:

A: The rubbing generates light. Wait, how? I don't think friction inside the eye creates light. Maybe like when you hit your eye and see a flash, but that's a different thing. Not sure about this one.

B: Pressure changes cornea shape, distorting signals. Changing the cornea shape would affect how light enters, but if your eyes are closed while rubbing, not much light is getting in. The patterns are more like phosphenes, which are caused by mechanical stimulation, not light distortion.

C: Triggers a reflex, pupils dilate. I don't think dilating pupils would create patterns. Plus, the question is about the patterns themselves, not the pupils.

D: Friction generates heat causing illusion. Heat doesn't directly make light patterns in the eye. The eye doesn't work that way. So probably not D.

E: Production of hallucinogen. That sounds unlikely. I don't think the eye produces drugs when pressed. Maybe some other part, but this seems off.

F: Stored light energy released. I don't recall the eye storing light energy like that. It's more about detecting light as it comes in.

G: Pressure stimulates receptor cells, which respond, and the brain sees light. That makes sense. The photoreceptor cells are usually triggered by light, but mechanical pressure might activate them too. So when you rub, you're mechanically stimulating them, sending signals to the brain, which interprets it as light patterns.

H: Changes blood flow to visual cortex. I'm not sure about the blood flow part. It could be, but I think the direct stimulation of the retina is more likely the cause.

I: Activates latent photoreceptor cells. I don't think there are 'latent' cells. They're either active or not, based on stimulus.

J: Optic nerve disoriented. The optic nerve being disoriented might cause random signals, but I think the initial cause is the receptor cells being pressed, not the nerve itself.

So putting it together, option G seems correct. The pressure from rubbing physically stimulates the photoreceptor cells, which send signals to the brain, which we perceive as light or patterns.

The phenomenon of seeing visual patterns when rubbing the eyes is due to the mechanical stimulation of photoreceptor cells in the retina. Normally, these cells respond to light by sending signals to the brain, which interprets them as visual information. When pressure is applied through rubbing, it physically stimulates these cells, causing them to activate even in the absence of light. This activation is then interpreted by the brain as light or patterns. 

Option G correctly explains this process, as it identifies that the pressure from rubbing stimulates the receptor nerve cells at the back of the retina, leading to the perception of light patterns.

Answer: G
