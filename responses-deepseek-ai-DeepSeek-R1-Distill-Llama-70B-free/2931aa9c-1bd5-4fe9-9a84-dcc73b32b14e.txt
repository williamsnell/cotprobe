Okay, so I've got this problem here about radioactive decay. Hmm, I remember that radioactive materials decay at a rate proportional to the amount present. The formula given is dQ/dt = -rQ, where r is the decay rate. I think this is a differential equation, and I should solve it to find r.

Wait, right, the solution to this differential equation is an exponential decay function. Oh yeah, the general formula is Q(t) = Q0 * e^(-rt), where Q0 is the initial amount. Or wait, sometimes I've seen it written as Q(t) = Q0 * e^(-kt), so k is the decay constant. So in this case, r is the decay constant.

The problem says that 100 mg of thorium-234 decays to 82.04 mg in 1 week. I need to find r. So I can plug these values into the formula.

Let me write down the known values. Q0 is 100 mg, Q(t) is 82.04 mg, t is 1 week. But wait, the answer options are in per day. Oh right, the time should be in days because the units are day^-1. So 1 week is 7 days.

So plugging into the formula: 82.04 = 100 * e^(-r * 7). Hmm, I need to solve for r.

Let me rearrange this. Divide both sides by 100: 82.04/100 = e^(-7r). So that's 0.8204 = e^(-7r).

To solve for r, I'll take the natural logarithm of both sides. So ln(0.8204) = ln(e^(-7r)).

The right side simplifies to -7r. So ln(0.8204) = -7r.

Wait, ln of a number less than 1 is negative. So that's okay. Let me compute ln(0.8204). I don't remember the exact value, but I can approximate it. Alternatively, maybe I should remember that ln(1 - x) is approximately -x for small x, but 0.8204 is 0.1796 less than 1. Hmm, that's about 18% decrease. So I'm not sure about approximating; better to compute it accurately.

Alternatively, maybe I can use a calculator. Oh wait, since this is a thought process, I should proceed as if I'm thinking through it without a calculator. Let me try to remember some ln values. I know that ln(0.8) is about -0.2231. Because e^(-0.2231) is about 0.8. So 0.8204 is a bit higher than 0.8, so the ln should be a bit higher (less negative) than -0.2231.

Let me think: Let's say I have ln(0.8204) ≈ ?

Wait, the exact calculation would be better. Let me denote x = 0.8204.

So ln(x) = ?

Let me recall that ln(1) is 0. ln(e) is 1, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can use the Taylor series for ln around 1. But that might take too long. Alternatively, perhaps I can just accept that I'll need to compute ln(0.8204) and proceed.

So, assuming I can compute ln(0.8204), let's say it's approximately. Let me see, 0.8204 is 82.04%, so the natural log of that. I think it's about -0.197. I'll have to check.

Wait, I think I can compute this more accurately. I'll use the formula ln(a) ≈ (a-1) - (a-1)^2/2 + (a-1)^3/3 - ... but that's for when a is near 1. Alternatively, I might just accept that I can't compute this without a calculator and proceed with the calculation.

So, ln(0.8204) ≈ let's say it's approximately -0.197. Let me check: e^(-0.197) is about e^(-0.2) is roughly 0.8187. Oh wait, 0.8187 is about 81.87%, and 0.8204 is a bit higher. So maybe the actual ln is closer to -0.20 than I thought.

Wait, let me think again. Let me compute e^(-0.197). Let me compute 0.197 *1 = 0.197.

e^(-0.197) ≈ 1 - 0.197 + (0.197)^2/2 - (0.197)^3/6 + (0.197)^4/24.

Compute each term:

1) 1 = 1

2) -0.197 → 0.803

3) (0.197)^2 ≈ 0.038809. Divided by 2 → ~0.0194045. So add that: 0.803 + 0.0194 = 0.8224.

4) (0.197)^3 ≈ 0.197 * 0.038809 ≈ 0.007651. Divided by 6 → ~0.001275. Subtract: 0.8224 - 0.001275 = 0.821125.

5) (0.197)^4 ≈ 0.007651 * 0.197 ≈ ~0.001507. Divided by 24 → ~0.0000628. Add: 0.821125 + 0.0000628 ≈ 0.8211878.

So e^(-0.197) ≈ 0.8212. But we know that e^(-r*7) = 0.8204. So 0.8204 is a bit less than 0.8212, which would imply that r is a bit higher than 0.197/7? Because a higher r would make the exponent more negative, thus e^(-7r) smaller.

Wait, because if at r=0.197/7, we have 0.8212. But we need 0.8204, which is lower. So that would mean that 7r is a bit larger than 0.197, so r is a bit larger than 0.197/7.

Wait wait, no, because in the equation, we have ln(0.8204) = -7r. So the actual value would be r = - ln(0.8204) /7.

So if I can compute ln(0.8204) more accurately, I can get a better estimate.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that ln(0.8204) = ln(1 - 0.1796). But 0.1796 is a significant portion, so maybe not the best approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator function in my mind, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can use exact computation.

Wait, perhaps I should recall that ln(2) is about 0.6931, ln(3) is about 1.0986, ln(1/2) is -0.6931. But I don't think that's helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a linear approximation between known points. For example, I know that ln(0.8) ≈ -0.2231, and ln(0.81) is a bit higher. Let me compute ln(0.81).

Hmm, e^(-0.2231) = 0.8. Then, e^(-0.21) is approximately? Let me compute e^(-0.21) → 1 -0.21 + 0.21²/2 - 0.21³/6 + ... 

Compute:

1) 1 =1

2) -0.21 → 0.79

3) 0.21² = 0.0441 → /2 → 0.02205 → 0.79 + 0.02205 = 0.81205

4) 0.21^3 = 0.009261 → /6 → ~0.0015435 → subtract → 0.81205 - 0.0015435 ≈ 0.8105.

5) 0.21^4 = 0.001944 → /24 → ~0.000081 → add → 0.8105 + 0.000081 = 0.810581.

So e^(-0.21) ≈ 0.8106. But 0.81 is 0.81, so that's close. So ln(0.81) ≈ -0.21.

Wait, but e^(-0.21) is 0.8106, very close to 0.81. So ln(0.81) is approximately -0.21. So 0.8204 is a bit higher than 0.81. So perhaps I can compute ln(0.82) as well.

Let me try e^(-0.20) → 1 -0.2 + 0.04/2 - 0.008/6 + 0.0016/24.

Compute:

1) 1 =1

2) -0.2 → 0.8

3) 0.04 → /2 → 0.02 → 0.82

4) 0.008 → /6 → ~0.001333 → subtract → 0.818667

5) 0.0016 → /24 → 0.0000667 → add → 0.8187337.

So e^(-0.2) is approximately 0.8187. So that's close to 0.82. So ln(0.8187) = -0.2.

So 0.8204 is a bit higher than 0.8187, which was e^(-0.2). So let's say that 0.8204 is e^(-x), where x is slightly less than 0.2. Let's find x such that e^(-x) = 0.8204.

We can use linear approximation. Let me set f(x) = e^(-x). Around x=0.2, f(x) = 0.8187. The derivative f’(x) = -e^(-x) → at x=0.2, it's -0.8187.

We want to find x where f(x) = 0.8204. So the difference from 0.8187 is Δf = 0.8204 - 0.8187 = 0.0017.

Using the linear approximation: Δf ≈ f’(x0) * Δx → 0.0017 ≈ (-0.8187) * Δx → Δx ≈ 0.0017 / (-0.8187) ≈ -0.002076. So x ≈ x0 + Δx = 0.2 - 0.002076 ≈ 0.197924.

So ln(0.8204) ≈ -0.197924.

Wait, but wait, because e^(-x) = 0.8204, so x = -ln(0.8204) → which would be approximately 0.1979.

So going back to the equation: ln(0.8204) = -7r → r = -ln(0.8204)/7 → r ≈ 0.1979 / 7 → let's compute that.

0.1979 divided by 7. Let's see: 7 * 0.028 = 0.196. So 0.1979 is 0.196 + 0.0019. So 0.1979 /7 = 0.028 + 0.0019/7 → which is approximately 0.028 + 0.0002714 ≈ 0.0282714.

So r ≈ 0.02827 per day. Wait, looking at the options, option F is 0.02828 day^-1. That's very close.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. Because I might have made a mistake in the approximation.

Wait, another approach: exact equation.

We have 82.04 = 100 * e^(-7r).

Divide both sides by 100: 0.8204 = e^(-7r).

Take natural log: ln(0.8204) = -7r.

So r = -ln(0.8204)/7.

Calculating ln(0.8204) using a calculator (if I had one). Let me think, perhaps using a calculator would give a more precise value.

The exact value of ln(0.8204) is approximately -0.197224.

Wait, let me check using a calculator (well, this is my mind, but perhaps I can remember that ln(0.8) is about -0.223, ln(0.81) is about -0.2107, ln(0.82) is ln(82/100) = ln(41/50) = ln(41) - ln(50). I know ln(40) is about 3.6889, ln(41) is a bit higher, perhaps 3.7136. Ln(50)=3.9120. So ln(41/50)=3.7136 - 3.9120 = -0.1984.

Wait, because 41/50 is 0.82, so ln(0.82) ≈ -0.1984.

But in our problem, it's 0.8204, which is slightly higher than 0.82, so ln(0.8204) should be slightly higher (less negative) than -0.1984.

So perhaps approximately -0.1980.

Let me compute r using that.

r = 0.1980 /7 → 0.0282857... which is approximately 0.028286 day^-1.

Looking at the options, option F is 0.02828 day^-1, which matches this.

So the correct answer should be F.

To determine the decay rate \( r \) of thorium-234, we start with the exponential decay formula:

\[
Q(t) = Q_0 e^{-rt},
\]

where \( Q_0 \) is the initial amount, \( Q(t) \) is the amount at time \( t \), and \( r \) is the decay rate. The problem states that \( Q_0 = 100 \, \text{mg} \), \( Q(t) = 82.04 \, \text{mg} \), and \( t = 1 \, \text{week} = 7 \, \text{days} \). Substituting these values into the formula:

\[
82.04 = 100 e^{-7r}.
\]

Dividing through by 100:

\[
0.8204 = e^{-7r}.
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(0.8204) = -7r.
\]

Rearranging for \( r \):

\[
r = -\frac{\ln(0.8204)}{7}.
\]

Using approximations for \( \ln(0.8204) \), we find that \( \ln(0.8204) \approx -0.197924 \). Substituting this value:

\[
r = -\frac{-0.197924}{7} = \frac{0.197924}{7} \approx 0.02828 \, \text{day}^{-1}.
\]

Comparing this result with the given options, the closest match is:

**F: 0.02828 \(\text{day}^{-1}\).**

Thus, the decay rate \( r \) is approximately \( 0.02828 \, \text{day}^{-1} \).
