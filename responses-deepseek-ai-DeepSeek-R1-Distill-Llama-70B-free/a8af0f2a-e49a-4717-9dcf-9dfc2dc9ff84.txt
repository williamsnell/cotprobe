Okay, so I have this inequality to solve: x² -6x + c < 0. And I need to find all positive values of c for which this inequality has real solutions. Hmm. Alright, let's think through this step by step.

First, I remember that a quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0 can have real solutions if its discriminant is positive. The discriminant D is b² - 4ac. But wait, in this case, the quadratic is not equal to zero but less than zero. So I'm dealing with an inequality here.

So the inequality x² -6x + c < 0 represents a quadratic function. The graph of this function is a parabola. Since the coefficient of x² is positive (1), the parabola opens upwards. That means the graph will be a U-shape, and the part of the graph below the x-axis (where y<0) will be between the two roots, if they exist.

So for the inequality x² -6x + c < 0 to have real solutions, the quadratic must have two distinct real roots. Because if it doesn't cross the x-axis, then it's always positive, and the inequality would have no solution.

Wait, right. So the first condition is that the quadratic equation x² -6x + c = 0 has two real roots. That happens when the discriminant is positive.

Let me calculate the discriminant D. Here, a is 1, b is -6, and c is c. So D = (-6)² - 4*1*c = 36 -4c. For two real roots, D must be greater than 0. So 36 -4c > 0. Solving for c: 36 > 4c → c < 9. So c must be less than 9. But since the question says positive values of c, c must be in (0,9).

Wait, but is that all? Let me think. The quadratic x² -6x + c will open upwards, so it will be below zero (negative) between its two roots. So for there to be real solutions where the quadratic is negative, there must be two real roots, which we've established requires D>0, so c<9. So c must be less than 9 and positive, so 0 < c <9.

Looking at the options, let's see. The options are A through J.

Option A is (0,0) which is just a point, not an interval. Option B is (6,0), which doesn't make sense because 6 is greater than 0. Interval from higher to lower isn't standard. Option C is (9,16), which starts at 9 and goes up, but since c must be less than 9, this is the opposite. Option D is (0,9), which matches what I found. Option E is (3,6), which is a subset of D. F is (6,6), a single point. G is (1,1), same. H is (0,6), which is a subset but perhaps too restrictive. I is (1,3), J is (4,9). Wait, wait, but earlier I thought that c must be less than 9. So the interval is (0,9), which is option D.

Wait, but let me double-check. So the quadratic is x² -6x + c. The roots are at x = [6 ± sqrt(36-4c)] / 2, which simplifies to 3 ± sqrt(9 - c). So for real roots, 9 - c must be positive, so c <9. So yes, c must be between 0 and 9. So the correct interval is (0,9), which is option D.

To determine the positive values of \( c \) for which the inequality \( x^2 - 6x + c < 0 \) has real solutions, we analyze the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 6x + c = 0 \). Since the parabola opens upwards (the coefficient of \( x^2 \) is positive), the inequality \( x^2 - 6x + c < 0 \) will have real solutions if and only if the quadratic has two distinct real roots. This requires the discriminant of the quadratic to be positive.

The discriminant \( D \) is given by:

\[
D = (-6)^2 - 4(1)(c) = 36 - 4c
\]

For two distinct real roots, \( D > 0 \), which implies:

\[
36 - 4c > 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad c < 9
\]

Since \( c \) must also be positive, the interval for \( c \) is:

\[
0 < c < 9
\]

In interval notation, this is \( (0, 9) \). Among the given options, the correct choice is:

D: \( (0, 9) \)

Answer: D
