Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here. Let me try to understand what it's asking. So, the question is about calculating the change in enthalpy (ΔH) for a sample of CO2 gas under certain conditions, using the van der Waals equation of state. Hmm, I remember that enthalpy change isn't just about heat when the process isn't at constant pressure. But wait, the problem says the volume is fixed. Oh right, so it's a constant volume process.

So the given data: we have 2.0 mol of CO2 in a fixed volume of 15.0 dm³ at an initial temperature of 300 K. They add 2.35 kJ of heat, and the temperature rises to 341 K. I need to find ΔH.

Wait, I remember that at constant volume, the heat added (q_v) equals the change in internal energy (ΔU). So q_v = ΔU. But the question asks for ΔH. So I need to relate ΔH to ΔU somehow.

The formula that connects ΔH and ΔU is ΔH = ΔU + Δ(PV). Oh wait, or more precisely, ΔH = ΔU + Δ(nRT) when considering ideal gases. But wait, CO2 is treated with the van der Waals equation here, so maybe the ideal gas law isn't directly applicable. Hmm, but for a real gas, how does this work?

Alternatively, another approach: the enthalpy change can be calculated using H = U + PV. So ΔH = ΔU + Δ(PV). But I'm not sure how to compute Δ(PV) for a real gas. Maybe I can stick with the ideal gas approximation for the PV term, even though the gas isn't ideal. Or perhaps the van der Waals equation can give me the correct PV.

Wait, but the problem gives us that all gases are perfect unless stated otherwise. Wait no, the first line says "Assume all gases are perfect unless stated otherwise." But wait, the problem says to assume CO2 is described by the van der Waals equation, so it's a real gas here. That complicates things.

But maybe I can proceed by first calculating ΔU, which is q_v (since it's constant volume and assuming no work done except expansion, but at constant volume, work is zero). So for a real gas, the internal energy change can be calculated from the heat at constant volume, but wait, that's only for ideal gases, right? Or is it valid for real gases as well?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again. For an ideal gas, ΔU depends only on temperature change, and at constant volume, q = ΔU. For a real gas, I think the same formula holds because ΔU is a state function and depends only on temperature change, regardless of the path. So even for real gases, q_v = ΔU. So that part is okay.

So, for CO2, regardless of being real or ideal, q_v = ΔU = n Cv,m (ΔT). But wait, for real gases, the heat capacity at constant volume isn't the same as for ideal gases. Oh, but the problem doesn't give us the Cv for CO2. Hmm, this might complicate things.

Wait, wait. The problem gives us the heat added, which is 2.35 kJ. So since this is a constant volume process, q_v is 2.35 kJ, which equals ΔU. So ΔU is 2.35 kJ, which is 2350 J.

But wait, let me double-check. The heat is supplied to the system, so it's positive. So ΔU is +2350 J.

Now, to find ΔH, we need to compute ΔH = ΔU + Δ(PV). But for a real gas, how do I find Δ(PV)? Alternatively, maybe I can approximate it using the van der Waals equation.

Wait, the van der Waals equation is [P + a(n/V)^2] (V/n - b) = RT. But I'm not sure about the exact form. Alternatively, for one mole, the equation is (P + a (n/V)^2)(V/n - b) = RT. But wait, more accurately, the van der Waals equation is (P + (n² a)/V²)(V - n b) = n R T. So for n moles, V is the volume.

But perhaps a better approach is to calculate the work done when the system goes from the initial state to the final state. But wait, since the volume is constant, the work is zero, and q = ΔU. So that's correct.

Alternatively, for the enthalpy change, another approach is to consider that H = U + PV. So ΔH = ΔU + Δ(PV). But since the process is at constant volume, I can write:

ΔH = q + Δ(PV)

But wait, no. Wait, because the process is constant volume, so the work done is PΔV, which is zero. So the first law says ΔU = q. So that's correct.

So, to find ΔH, I need to calculate Δ(PV). Let me compute (P_final * V_final) - (P_initial * V_initial). But wait, V is constant, so V_final = V_initial. So Δ(PV) = V (P_final - P_initial).

So ΔH = ΔU + V (P_final - P_initial)

So I need to find P_initial and P_final using the van der Waals equation, then compute the change.

So, let's compute the initial and final pressures.

Given:
n = 2.0 mol
V = 15.0 dm³ = 0.015 m³ (since 1 m³ = 1000 dm³)
Initial T: 300 K
Final T: 341 K

The van der Waals constants for CO2: I remember that a and b are specific to each gas. Let me try to recall or find them. Alternatively, maybe I can look them up. Wait, I can't access external information, so perhaps I should remember approximate values.

Wait, I think for CO2, a is about 3.658 L² bar/mol² and b is about 0.04267 L/mol. Wait, but I'm not sure. Let me think: the units for a in van der Waals equation are (atm·L²)/mol² or similar. Alternatively, maybe in SI units. Alternatively, perhaps I should remember that for CO2, a is 3.658 L²·bar/mol² and b is 0.04267 L/mol. Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the values from common tables. But I'm making this up as I go along.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed symbolically. Let me write the van der Waals equation as:

[P + (n² a)/V²] (V/n - b) = RT

Wait, but that's for n moles. So for each mole, it would be (P + a (n/V)^2) (V/n - b) = RT. Hmm, maybe I can write this as:

P = [nRT/(V - n b)] - a (n/V)^2

Wait, yes, that's another way to write the van der Waals equation for n moles.

So P = (n R T)/(V - n b) ) - a (n² / V² )

So, for initial conditions, T_initial = 300 K, and final T = 341 K.

So I need to compute P_initial and P_final.

But to compute that, I need a and b values for CO2.

Wait, maybe I can proceed by assuming standard a and b values. Let me try to recall: for CO2, a is approximately 3.659 L²·bar/mol² and b is about 0.04267 L/mol. But wait, the units have to be consistent. Since in the problem, pressure is in bar (since 1 atm = 1.01325 bar), perhaps using bar as the unit would be easier.

So, let's note:

a = 3.659 L² bar / mol²
b = 0.04267 L/mol

So, for n=2.0 mol, V=15.0 L.

Wait, V is 15 dm³ which is 15 liters. Right, because 1 dm³ = 1 liter.

So, let's compute P_initial and P_final.

Compute P_initial at T=300 K:

P_initial = [n R T / (V - n b) ] - [a (n²) / V² ]

Wait, but R is the gas constant. Using units that match bar. Let's see, R is 0.08314 L·bar/(mol·K), I think.

So R = 0.08314 L bar / (mol K)

So let's plug in the numbers.

n=2.0 mol, V=15 L.

Compute denominator for the first term: V - n b = 15 L - 2.0 * 0.04267 L = 15 - 0.08534 = 14.91466 L

So the first term is (2.0 mol) * (0.08314 L bar/mol K) * 300 K / 14.91466 L

Compute numerator: 2 * 0.08314 * 300 = 2 * 24.942 = 49.884

So 49.884 / 14.91466 ≈ 3.346 bar.

Then the second term: a (n^2) / V² = 3.659 (L² bar/mol²) * (4 mol²) / (225 L²) )

Because n²=4, V²=225.

So 3.659 *4 = 14.636

14.636 / 225 ≈ 0.06507 bar.

So P_initial = 3.346 bar - 0.06507 bar ≈ 3.281 bar.

Wait, but wait: the van der Waals equation gives P in bar when using R=0.08314. So that's correct.

Now compute P_final at T=341 K.

Same V=15 L, n=2.0, a and b same.

First term:

V - n b = 14.91466 L (same as before)

n R T = 2 * 0.08314 * 341 = 2 * 28.317 = 56.634

So 56.634 / 14.91466 ≈ 3.795 bar.

Second term: a (n²)/V² = same as before. 14.636 / 225 ≈ 0.06507 bar.

So P_final = 3.795 - 0.06507 ≈ 3.7299 bar.

So P_initial ≈ 3.281 bar

P_final ≈ 3.730 bar

Now, compute Δ(PV) = V (P_final - P_initial )

V is 15 L.

Δ(PV) = 15 L * (3.730 bar - 3.281 bar ) = 15 * 0.449 bar·L.

Wait, 1 bar·L is 100 J, because 1 bar = 10^5 Pa, 1 L = 0.001 m³, so 1 bar·L = 10^5 * 0.001 = 100 J.

So 0.449 bar·L = 0.449 * 100 = 44.9 J.

But wait, 15 * 0.449 = 6.735 bar·L. Oh I see, I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, 3.730 - 3.281 = 0.449 bar.

So 15 L * 0.449 bar = 6.735 bar·L.

Convert to Joules: 6.735 bar·L * 100 J/(bar·L) = 673.5 J.

So Δ(PV) is 673.5 J.

Now, ΔH = ΔU + Δ(PV) = 2350 J + 673.5 J = 3023.5 J ≈ 3024 J, which is 3.024 kJ.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, n R T for P_initial:

n=2, R=0.08314, T=300.

2 * 0.08314 = 0.16628

0.16628 *300 = 49.884

49.884 / 14.91466 ≈ 3.346 bar.

Yes, that's correct.

Second term: a (n²)/V² =3.659 *4 /225 =14.636/225≈0.06507 bar.

So P_initial=3.346 -0.06507=3.2809 bar.

Similarly for T=341:

2 *0.08314=0.16628; 0.16628 * 341=56.634 (approx 56.634)

56.634 /14.91466 ≈3.795 bar.

Second term same as before, 0.06507.

So P_final=3.795-0.06507=3.7299 bar.

ΔP=3.7299 -3.2809=0.449 bar.

Δ(PV)=15 L * 0.449 bar =6.735 bar·L.

Now, 1 bar·L is 100 J, so 6.735 *100=673.5 J.

ΔU is 2350 J, so ΔH=2350 +673.5=3023.5 J, which is 3.0235 kJ, approximately 3.02 kJ.

Looking at the options, option H is +3.03 kJ. That's very close.

So the answer should be H.
</think>

To calculate the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the given process, we start by noting that the volume is constant, so the heat supplied (q_v) equals the change in internal energy (ΔU). The problem states that 2.35 kJ of heat is added, so:

\[
\Delta U = q_v = +2.35 \, \text{kJ}.
\]

Next, we use the relationship between enthalpy and internal energy:

\[
\Delta H = \Delta U + \Delta(PV).
\]

The term Δ(PV) is calculated as:

\[
\Delta(PV) = V \cdot (P_{\text{final}} - P_{\text{initial}}),
\]

where \(P_{\text{initial}}\) and \(P_{\text{final}}\) are the pressures at the initial and final states, respectively. To compute these pressures, we use the van der Waals equation of state:

\[
P = \frac{nRT}{V - nb} - \frac{a(n^2)}{V^2}.
\]

### Given Data:
- \(n = 2.0 \, \text{mol}\),
- \(V = 15.0 \, \text{L}\),
- \(T_{\text{initial}} = 300 \, \text{K}\),
- \(T_{\text{final}} = 341 \, \text{K}\),
- \(a = 3.659 \, \text{L}^2 \cdot \text{bar}/\text{mol}^2\),
- \(b = 0.04267 \, \text{L}/\text{mol}\),
- \(R = 0.08314 \, \text{L} \cdot \text{bar}/\text{mol} \cdot \text{K}\).

### Step 1: Calculate \(P_{\text{initial}}\) at \(T = 300 \, \text{K}\)
\[
P_{\text{initial}} = \frac{(2.0)(0.08314)(300)}{15 - (2.0)(0.04267)} - \frac{(3.659)(2.0^2)}{15^2}.
\]

- Denominator for the first term: \(15 - 0.08534 = 14.91466 \, \text{L}\),
- First term: \(\frac{(2.0)(0.08314)(300)}{14.91466} \approx 3.346 \, \text{bar}\),
- Second term: \(\frac{(3.659)(4)}{225} \approx 0.06507 \, \text{bar}\),
- \(P_{\text{initial}} = 3.346 - 0.06507 \approx 3.281 \, \text{bar}\).

### Step 2: Calculate \(P_{\text{final}}\) at \(T = 341 \, \text{K}\)
\[
P_{\text{final}} = \frac{(2.0)(0.08314)(341)}{15 - (2.0)(0.04267)} - \frac{(3.659)(2.0^2)}{15^2}.
\]

- Denominator for the first term: \(15 - 0.08534 = 14.91466 \, \text{L}\),
- First term: \(\frac{(2.0)(0.08314)(341)}{14.91466} \approx 3.795 \, \text{bar}\),
- Second term: \(\frac{(3.659)(4)}{225} \approx 0.06507 \, \text{bar}\),
- \(P_{\text{final}} = 3.795 - 0.06507 \approx 3.730 \, \text{bar}\).

### Step 3: Calculate \(\Delta(PV)\)
\[
\Delta(PV) = V \cdot (P_{\text{final}} - P_{\text{initial}}) = 15 \cdot (3.730 - 3.281) = 15 \cdot 0.449 = 6.735 \, \text{bar} \cdot \text{L}.
\]

Convert to joules (\(1 \, \text{bar} \cdot \text{L} = 100 \, \text{J}\)):

\[
\Delta(PV) = 6.735 \cdot 100 = 673.5 \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \(\Delta H\)
\[
\Delta H = \Delta U + \Delta(PV) = 2350 \, \text{J} + 673.5 \, \text{J} = 3023.5 \, \text{J} \approx 3.02 \, \text{kJ}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The closest option to the calculated value is **+3.03 kJ**, which corresponds to **option H**.
