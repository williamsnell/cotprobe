Question:

A law bookstore entered into a written contract to purchase from the publisher 100 copies of the latest edition of a certain casebook for $10 per book. Three days after the contract was formed, but prior to delivery of the casebooks, the publisher called the owner of the law bookstore and informed him that, because of a calculation error, the price for the casebooks should have been $11 per book, and the shipment could not be delivered unless the owner promised to pay that amount. The owner reluctantly agreed. The owner's agreement to pay $11 per book is

Options:

A: unenforceable, because the original contract terms should prevail.
B: enforceable, if the publisher could prove the existence of a calculation error.
C: unenforceable, because it is violative of the statute of frauds.
D: unenforceable, because the error resulted from the publisher's computational error.
E: unenforceable, because the increase in price was not agreed upon at the time the contract was formed.
F: enforceable, because the owner agreed to the new terms.
G: enforceable, because the publisher had the right to correct his mistake.
H: enforceable, under the principle of promissory estoppel.
I: enforceable, because it was not supported by any new consideration.

Okay, so I've got this contract law question here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the scenario is about a law bookstore that entered into a written contract with a publisher to buy 100 copies of a casebook at $10 each. Three days later, the publisher calls and says there was a calculation error, so the price should actually be $11 each. They refuse to ship unless the owner agrees to the new price. The owner reluctantly agrees. The question is whether this new agreement is enforceable.

Hmm. I remember there's something about modifying contracts and consideration. So, under contract law, for a modification to be enforceable, there usually needs to be consideration. Consideration is like something of value exchanged between the parties. So in the original contract, the publisher agreed to deliver the books for $10 each, and the bookstore agreed to pay that. Now, they're trying to change the price.

Wait, but the publisher is trying to increase the price. The bookstore owner is agreeing, but I'm not sure if that's enough. There's a doctrine called the pre-existing duty rule, which says that if you're asking someone to do something they're already obligated to do, that doesn't count as new consideration. So here, the publisher was already supposed to deliver the books for $10. If they now ask for $11, and the bookstore agrees, is there consideration for that extra dollar?

I think in this case, there's no new consideration from the publisher. They're just demanding more money for the same obligation. So the modification wouldn't be enforceable because it lacks consideration. Unless some other exception applies.

Wait, what about the mistake? The publisher said there was a calculation error. So maybe they're trying to correct a mistake. But I'm not sure if that applies here. The mistake would typically allow for reformation of the contract if it was a mutual mistake or if one party knew about the mistake and the other didn't. But in this case, the publisher made a unilateral mistake in calculating the price. I think that the other party (the bookstore) isn't obligated to agree to the correction unless they choose to, especially if they've already formed the contract.

So the publisher can't just unilaterally change the terms without some consideration. The bookstore's agreement to pay more without getting anything extra might not be enforceable because there's no consideration for the modification.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: Unenforceable because original terms should prevail. Maybe, but I'm not sure if it's that straightforward.

Option B: Enforceable if calculation error is proved. I don't think the mistake alone makes it enforceable without consideration.

Option C: Unenforceable under statute of frauds. The original contract was written, so statute of frauds might not apply to the modification unless the modification itself needs to be in writing. But the question doesn't say anything about a writing for the modification, so maybe that's not the issue here.

Option D: Unenforceable because the error was the publisher's. That aligns with the pre-existing duty idea. If the publisher made a mistake, they can't enforce a higher price without consideration.

Option E: Unenforceable because the price increase wasn't agreed upon initially. That seems similar to A, but maybe more specific about consideration.

Option F: Enforceable because the owner agreed. But agreement alone without consideration might not make it enforceable.

Option G: Enforceable because the publisher can correct their mistake. I think this is wrong because a unilateral mistake doesn't automatically allow contract modification without consideration.

Option H: Enforceable under promissory estoppel. I'm not sure. Promissory estoppel applies when someone makes a promise that the other party relies on to their detriment. But here, the bookstore is the one making the new promise. I don't see a clear application here.

Option I: Enforceable because no new consideration. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. The absence of consideration should make it unenforceable, not enforceable. So I think option I is incorrect.

Wait, option D says it's unenforceable because the error was the publisher's computational error. That might be the case because the publisher can't enforce a modification without consideration, and the mistake doesn't provide a basis for enforcing the modification without consideration.

So putting it all together, the owner's agreement to pay $11 lacks consideration because the publisher is asking for more money without giving anything extra. Thus, the modification is unenforceable. So the correct answer would be option D or E.

Wait, option E says it's unenforceable because the increase wasn't agreed upon at the time of contract formation. But that's more about the original agreement. The issue here is the modification. So the better reason is that there's no consideration for the modification, which falls under the pre-existing duty rule. So which option covers that? Option D says it's unenforceable because the error was the publisher's. That might be the reason, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, the answer might be option D because the error was on the publisher's side, so they can't enforce a modification without consideration. So I think the correct answer is D.

The scenario involves a written contract between a law bookstore and a publisher for 100 casebooks at $10 each. Three days later, the publisher, citing a calculation error, demanded $11 per book and refused shipment unless the bookstore agreed. The owner reluctantly agreed, raising the question of whether this new agreement is enforceable.

Under contract law, modifications typically require consideration. The pre-existing duty rule states that performing or promising to perform an existing obligation does not constitute new consideration. Here, the publisher was already obligated to deliver the books for $10, and demanding an additional $1 without providing anything extra does not create new consideration. Therefore, the modification lacks enforceability due to the absence of consideration.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: While the original terms should prevail, the issue is more about the enforceability of the modification, not just the original terms.
- **B**: Proof of a calculation error does not automatically make the modification enforceable without consideration.
- **C**: The statute of frauds is not the main issue here, as the original contract was written.
- **D**: Correct. The modification is unenforceable because the publisher's computational error does not provide a basis for enforcing the modification without consideration.
- **E**: While the price increase was not agreed upon initially, the key issue is the lack of consideration for the modification.
- **F**: Agreement alone does not make the modification enforceable without consideration.
- **G**: A unilateral mistake does not grant the right to modify the contract without consideration.
- **H**: Promissory estoppel does not apply here, as there is no clear reliance or detriment.
- **I**: Incorrect, as the absence of consideration makes the modification unenforceable, not enforceable.

The correct answer is **D**, as the publisher's computational error does not justify enforcing the modification without consideration.
