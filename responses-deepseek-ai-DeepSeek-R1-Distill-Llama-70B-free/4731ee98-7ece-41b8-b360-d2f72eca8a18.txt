Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this statistics problem. Let's see what it's about. The question is about estimating the proportion of students in favor of showing movies biweekly instead of monthly. They want a 90 percent confidence interval with a width of at most 0.08. And the question is asking how many students should be sampled. The options are from A to J, with various numbers.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with confidence intervals for proportions, there's a formula to calculate the required sample size. I think it's something like n = (Z^2 * p * (1-p)) / E^2, where Z is the Z-score, p is the sample proportion, and E is the margin of error. 

Wait, but in this case, they're giving the width of the confidence interval, which is the total width. So the width is 2E, because the confidence interval is from the sample proportion minus E to the sample proportion plus E. So if the width is 0.08, then E is half of that, which is 0.04.

Right, so E is 0.04. Now, what's the Z-score for a 90% confidence level? I remember that for a 90% confidence interval, the Z-score is around 1.645. Wait, no, wait! Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the Z for 90% confidence is actually 1.645 for a one-sided test, but for a two-tailed test (which confidence intervals usually are), maybe it's different? Or wait, no, confidence intervals are two-tailed, so the Z-score is based on the two-tailed critical value. Let me think. For 90% confidence, the area in the tails is 5% on each side, so total 10% in the tails. So the Z-score is the value where 5% is to the right (for the upper tail). Looking at the Z-table, that's approximately 1.645, but wait, wait, no, wait another thing. Wait, for a 90% confidence interval, the alpha is 0.10 (since 1 - 0.90 = 0.10), and that's split into two tails, so each tail is 0.05. So the Z-score is indeed the value that leaves 0.05 in the upper tail, which is 1.645. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but wait, sometimes I get confused between 95% and 90%. Let me double-check. For 95%, Z is 1.96, right. So 90% should be a bit lower. Yes, 1.645 is correct because 1.645 corresponds to about 90% confidence (since 1.645 gives 90% coverage, with 5% in each tail).

So, Z is 1.645. Now, the formula is n = (Z^2 * p*(1-p)) / E^2. But wait, what's p? Because p is the proportion we're estimating, but in the formula, we usually don't know p when we're calculating the sample size needed. So what do we do? Oh right, the maximum variance occurs when p is 0.5. Because p*(1-p) is maximized when p=0.5. So to be conservative, we use p=0.5 when we don't have prior information. That way, we ensure that the sample size is sufficient regardless of the true proportion.

So p = 0.5. Then, p*(1-p) is 0.25. So plugging the numbers in: Z is 1.645, so Z squared is (1.645)^2. Let me calculate that. 1.6 squared is 2.56, and 0.045 squared is about 0.002025, but I'm just approximating. Wait, 1.645 * 1.645. Let's compute it step by step. 1.6 * 1.6 is 2.56. Then 0.045 * 1.6 is 0.072, so 1.6 * 0.045 is 0.072. Then 0.045 * 0.045 is 0.002025. Wait, but wait, actually, (a + b)^2 is a² + 2ab + b². So (1.6 + 0.045)^2 = 1.6² + 2*(1.6)*(0.045) + 0.045². So:

1.6² = 2.56
2*1.6*0.045 = 2*0.072 = 0.144
0.045² = 0.002025
Adding them up: 2.56 + 0.144 is 2.704, plus 0.002025 is 2.706025. So Z² is approximately 2.706.

So now, Z squared is about 2.706. Multiply that by p*(1-p), which is 0.25. So 2.706 * 0.25 is 0.6765. Then, E is 0.04, so E squared is 0.0016 (because 0.04 * 0.04 is 0.0016). Now, n is 0.6765 divided by 0.0016.

Let me compute that. 0.6765 / 0.0016. Let's see, 0.6765 divided by 0.0016 is the same as 676.5 divided by 1.6. Because moving the decimal four places in both numerator and denominator.

So 676.5 / 1.6. Let me compute that. 1.6 times 400 is 640. 676.5 minus 640 is 36.5. So 36.5 /1.6 is 22.8125. So 400 + 22.8125 = 422.8125. So approximately 423.

Wait, but let me double-check that division. 1.6 * 423 = ?

Let's compute 400 *1.6 is 640. 23*1.6 is 36.8. So 640 +36.8 = 676.8. So 1.6 *423=676.8. So 676.5 is just 0.3 less than 676.8. So 423 would give 676.8, but our numerator is 676.5, so 423 - (0.3/1.6) is approximately 423 - 0.1875 = 422.8125. So yeah, 423 is the correct sample size.

Looking at the options, option C is 423. So the answer should be C.

To determine the required sample size for estimating the proportion of students in favor of showing movies biweekly, we use the formula for the sample size of a proportion:

\[
n = \frac{Z^2 \cdot p \cdot (1-p)}{E^2}
\]

Where:
- \( Z \) is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level.
- \( p \) is the proportion being estimated.
- \( E \) is the margin of error.

### Step 1: Identify the parameters
- The confidence level is 90%, so the Z-score is approximately \( 1.645 \) (since the area in each tail is 5%).
- The width of the confidence interval is given as 0.08, so the margin of error \( E \) is half of this, \( E = 0.04 \).
- Since the true proportion \( p \) is unknown, we use \( p = 0.5 \) to maximize the variance \( p \cdot (1-p) \), ensuring the sample size is sufficient regardless of the true proportion.

### Step 2: Calculate the sample size
1. Compute \( Z^2 \):  
   \[
   Z^2 = (1.645)^2 \approx 2.706
   \]

2. Compute \( p \cdot (1-p) \):  
   \[
   p \cdot (1-p) = 0.5 \cdot 0.5 = 0.25
   \]

3. Compute \( E^2 \):  
   \[
   E^2 = (0.04)^2 = 0.0016
   \]

4. Substitute into the formula:  
   \[
   n = \frac{2.706 \cdot 0.25}{0.0016} = \frac{0.6765}{0.0016} \approx 422.8125
   \]

Since the sample size must be an integer, we round up to the next whole number, giving \( n = 423 \).

### Final Answer
The required sample size is **423**, which corresponds to option **C**.
