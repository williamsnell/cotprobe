Question:

Heavenly Flights charter club charges its members $200 annually. The club's director is considering reducing the annual fee by $2 for all members whenever applicants in excess of 60 members join . For example, if club membership stands at 60 and two new members are added, this will decrease everyone's fee by $4 and the new annual fee would be $196 per member. How many extra members maximize revenue?

Options:

A: 110
B: 60
C: 120
D: 50
E: 80
F: 100
G: 130
H: 40
I: 90
J: 70

Okay, so I've got this problem here about Heavenly Flights charter club. Let's see what it says. The club charges $200 annually to its members. The director is thinking about reducing the annual fee by $2 for every member whenever there are applicants beyond 60. Hmm, so if there are more than 60 new members, the fee goes down by $2 each time.

Wait, the example says if membership is at 60 and two new members are added, the fee decreases by $4. Oh, right, because each new member beyond 60 reduces the fee by $2. So two new members would mean a $4 decrease, making the fee $196.

The question is asking how many extra members would maximize the revenue. So I need to find the number of extra members that results in the highest total revenue.

Let me break this down. Revenue is the number of members multiplied by the annual fee per member. Let’s denote the number of extra members as x. But wait, the original membership is 60, and x is the number of new members beyond that. So the total number of members would be 60 + x.

The fee per member starts at $200 and decreases by $2 for each extra member. So the fee would be 200 - 2x dollars.

So the revenue R would be (60 + x) multiplied by (200 - 2x). Let me write that as a function:

R(x) = (60 + x) * (200 - 2x)

I need to find the value of x that maximizes R. To do that, I can expand this equation and then find its maximum by taking the derivative or perhaps using vertex formula since it's a quadratic.

Expanding the equation:

R(x) = (60)(200) + 60*(-2x) + x*(200) + x*(-2x)
R(x) = 12000 - 120x + 200x - 2x²
Combine like terms:
R(x) = 12000 + 80x - 2x²

So, R(x) = -2x² +80x + 12000

This is a quadratic equation in the form ax² + bx + c, where a = -2, b =80.

Since the coefficient of x² is negative, the parabola opens downward, which means the vertex is the maximum point.

The x-coordinate of the vertex is found using -b/(2a). So plugging in the values:

x = -80 / (2*(-2)) = -80 / (-4) = 20.

Wait, that gives x=20. So 20 extra members beyond 60. So the total members would be 60+20=80. But wait, the options include 80 as option E. Hmm, but wait, let me make sure I'm interpreting x correctly.

Wait, the question says "how many extra members", so x is the extra. So if x is 20, that's 20 extra beyond 60, making total 80.

But let me double-check the calculation. Because sometimes I might mix up the variables.

Let me recast the problem. Let’s say the number of extra members beyond 60 is n. So total members N =60 +n. The fee per member is 200 - 2n. So revenue R = N * fee = (60 +n)(200 -2n).

Expanding, R=60*200 +60*(-2n) +n*200 +n*(-2n) =12000 -120n +200n -2n² =12000 +80n -2n².

So R = -2n² +80n +12000.

To find the maximum, take derivative dR/dn = -4n +80. Setting to zero: -4n +80=0 →4n=80 →n=20.

So yes, n=20 extra members. So the total members would be 60+20=80.

Looking at the options, E is 80. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but let me make sure that no calculation error happened. Let me compute R when n=20.

Total members =80. Fee per member =200 -40=160. So revenue is 80*160=12,800.

If n=19: total members=79. Fee=200-38=162. R=79*162= let's see: 79*(160+2)=79*160 +79*2=12,640 +158=12,798. Less than 12,800.

n=21: total=81. Fee=200-42=158. R=81*158= let's compute 80*158=12,640 plus 1*158=158 →12,798. Again, less than 12,800.

So n=20 gives maximum revenue.

So the correct answer is E:80.

To determine how many extra members maximize revenue, we start by defining the number of extra members as \( x \). The total number of members becomes \( 60 + x \), and the annual fee per member decreases by $2 for each extra member, making the fee \( 200 - 2x \). The revenue \( R \) is then calculated as:

\[
R(x) = (60 + x)(200 - 2x)
\]

Expanding this equation:

\[
R(x) = 60 \cdot 200 + 60 \cdot (-2x) + x \cdot 200 + x \cdot (-2x)
\]
\[
R(x) = 12000 - 120x + 200x - 2x^2
\]
\[
R(x) = -2x^2 + 80x + 12000
\]

This is a quadratic equation in the form \( R(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \), where \( a = -2 \), \( b = 80 \), and \( c = 12000 \). Since \( a < 0 \), the parabola opens downward, and the vertex represents the maximum revenue. The x-coordinate of the vertex is given by:

\[
x = -\frac{b}{2a}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
x = -\frac{80}{2(-2)} = \frac{80}{4} = 20
\]

Thus, \( x = 20 \) extra members maximize the revenue. The total number of members is \( 60 + 20 = 80 \). Verifying with the options, \( 80 \) corresponds to option E.

To confirm, calculate the revenue at \( x = 20 \):  
Total members = 80, fee per member = \( 200 - 2(20) = 160 \), and revenue = \( 80 \cdot 160 = 12,800 \). Checking \( x = 19 \) and \( x = 21 \) yields lower revenues, confirming that \( x = 20 \) maximizes revenue.

The correct answer is:

**E: 80**
