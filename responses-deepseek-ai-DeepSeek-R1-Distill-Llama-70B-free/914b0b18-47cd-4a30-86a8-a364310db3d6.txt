Okay, so I have this problem here about methane gas and calculating the work done during a reversible expansion. Hmm, I remember that work done during expansion is related to pressure and volume changes, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me think.

The problem gives me that a 4.50 g sample of methane occupies 12.7 dm³ at 310 K. Wait, I need to find the work done when this same expansion happens reversibly. Oh right, for reversible processes, the work is calculated using the integral of P dV, but since it's an ideal gas, I can probably use the formula involving pressure and volume changes.

Wait, I think the formula is work (w) equals negative the integral from V_initial to V_final of P dV. And since it's reversible, the pressure changes as the system expands, so I can't just use initial or final pressure directly. That's when I remember that for an ideal gas undergoing a reversible process, the work can be calculated using w = -nRT ln(V2/V1), since PV = nRT. Or wait, sometimes it's expressed in terms of pressure: w = -nRT ln(P1/P2). Because when the gas expands, the volume increases, so the pressure decreases.

But wait, in this problem, I don't know the initial and final states except for the final volume. Oh, wait, maybe the problem assumes that the expansion is happening from the initial state to the final state, but I'm not given the initial volume. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, no, the question says that the same expansion occurs reversibly. So I think the expansion is from some initial state (maybe at a lower volume) to the given final volume of 12.7 dm³. But I don't have the initial volume. Hmm, maybe I need to find the initial volume using the ideal gas law, assuming that the expansion is against a constant external pressure, but the problem says the expansion is reversible, so it's a quasi-static process.

Wait, perhaps the initial state is at a certain pressure and volume, and the expansion is to 12.7 dm³. But I don't have the initial volume or pressure. Hmm, maybe I should check the given data again.

Wait, the problem says a sample of 4.50 g methane occupies 12.7 dm³ at 310 K. So perhaps that's the final state after expansion. Oh, wait, no, maybe that's the initial state. Wait, the question is about the work done when the same expansion occurs reversibly. So maybe the expansion is from an initial state to this state, and I need to calculate the work for that expansion.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the given state as the final state, and find the initial state using the ideal gas law. Because work done in expansion would be from the initial to the final state.

So, first, calculate moles of methane. Methane is CH4, so molar mass is 16 g/mol (12 from C, 4 from H). So 4.50 g / 16 g/mol = 0.28125 mol.

At 310 K, volume is 12.7 dm³, which is 0.0127 m³ (since 1 m³ = 1000 dm³). Using PV = nRT.

Wait, R is 8.314 J/mol·K. So P = nRT / V.

So P = (0.28125 mol) * (8.314 J/mol·K) * (310 K) / 0.0127 m³.

Let me compute that. Let's calculate numerator: 0.28125 *8.314 = approx 2.338. Then 2.338 *310 = approx 724.58. Then divide by 0.0127: 724.58 /0.0127 ≈ 57,100 Pa. Wait, 1 atm is about 101325 Pa, so this is roughly 0.56 atm? But wait, maybe I should be precise.

Wait, 0.28125 *8.314 = let's compute that accurately.

0.28125 *8 = 2.25, 0.28125 *0.314=0.0883125. So total is 2.3383125.

Multiply by 310: 2.3383125 *310 = let's see. 2 *310=620, 0.3383125 *310 ≈ 104. So total is 724.21875 J·mol⁻¹·K⁻¹ × K → J/(m³). Wait, no, because R is in J/(mol·K), so the units would be J/(m³) which is Pascals.

So 724.21875 J/(m³) → Pa.

Divided by volume 0.0127 m³ → 724.21875 / 0.0127 = let's calculate this.

0.0127 m³ is 12.7 dm³, which is 12700 cm³, but maybe better to compute 724.21875 / 0.0127.

Compute 724.21875 / 0.0127.

Same as 724218.75 / 12700 → wait, let me do it step by step.

724.21875 divided by 0.0127.

Let me write it as 724.21875 ÷ 0.0127.

0.0127 is 1.27e-2, so 724.21875 / 1.27e-2 = 724.21875 / 0.0127.

Compute 724.21875 / 0.0127. Hmm, 0.0127 * 57000 = 724. (0.0127 *57000= 57000 *127e-4 = 57000 *0.0127= 723.9). So approximately 57000 Pa. So P ≈57,000 Pa, which is about 0.56 atm.

Wait, but for the work calculation, perhaps the pressure isn't needed. Because the work done during reversible expansion is given by w = -nRT ln(V2/V1), but wait, I don't have V1. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the expansion is from some initial volume to 12.7 dm³. But without knowing the initial volume, maybe the problem is assuming that the expansion is against a constant external pressure, and that the work done is P_external times the change in volume. But the problem states that it's a reversible process, so the external pressure is almost equal to the internal pressure, and the work is calculated using the integral, which leads to the nRT ln(V2/V1) formula.

Wait, maybe the initial volume is smaller, and the expansion is to 12.7 dm³. But without the initial volume, I'm stuck. Wait, perhaps the initial state is at a different pressure, but I don't have that either. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, the question says that the work done is for the same expansion occurring reversibly. So perhaps the expansion from some initial state to the final state, which is the given state. So the only way I can think of is that the work is calculated as w = -P_ext ΔV, but in reversible process, P_ext is almost equal to P, so it's better to use the integral which gives the formula with the natural log.

Wait, but without knowing the initial volume, how can I compute V2/V1? Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Let me read it again.

The problem says: A sample of 4.50 g of methane occupies 12.7 dm³ at 310 K. Calculate the work done if the same expansion occurred reversibly.

Wait a minute, perhaps the expansion is at 310 K, and the same expansion refers to the same volume change. But wait, that doesn't make sense unless the initial volume was something else. Maybe the expansion is from a certain initial volume to 12.7 dm³.

Wait, perhaps the expansion is from the molar volume at STP or something else, but no, the data is given at 310 K. Alternatively, maybe the expansion is from a certain pressure, say, perhaps the initial pressure is higher.

Wait, maybe the way to approach this is to realize that the work done during a reversible expansion is calculated using the formula w = -nRT ln(V2/V1), but I need to find V1.

Alternatively, perhaps the expansion is against a constant external pressure, but if it's reversible, the external pressure is equal to the gas pressure at every step, so the work is the integral from V1 to V2 of P dV, which is nRT ln(V2/V1) with a negative sign.

But without knowing V1, I can't compute this. Unless V1 is the molar volume at STP, but I don't think so. Wait, maybe the expansion is from a certain initial state to the given final state, but I don't have that initial state.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the question is implying that the expansion is from a certain initial volume to 12.7 dm³, but perhaps the initial volume is zero? No, that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the expansion is free, or perhaps it's against atmospheric pressure. Wait, the problem doesn't specify, but the fact that it's a reversible process suggests that the external pressure is almost equal to the internal pressure.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is not providing enough information, but I must have missed something.

Wait, perhaps the work done is calculated using the formula w = -P_ext (V2 - V1), but for reversible process, P_ext is approximately equal to P, so we can integrate that. Wait, but without knowing V1, I can't proceed. Alternatively, perhaps the expansion is from a state where the pressure is atmospheric, but that's an assumption.

Wait, maybe the expansion is from a state where the gas was at a higher pressure, perhaps, but I don't know what that is.

Wait, perhaps another approach: Maybe the problem is considering the expansion at constant temperature, but that's not stated. The temperature is 310 K, which is the temperature during the expansion.

Wait, maybe I should think of the expansion as being isothermal. So for an isothermal reversible expansion, the work is w = -nRT ln(V2/V1).

But I don't know V1. Unless the initial volume is the volume the gas would occupy under standard conditions. But no, the temperature here is 310 K, not 298 K.

Wait, I'm stuck. Let me try to think differently. Let's see, the problem gives the mass of methane as 4.50 g, which we can convert to moles. Moles n = 4.50 g / 16.04 g/mol ≈ 0.2804 mol.

The volume is 12.7 dm³, which is 0.0127 m³. At 310 K, so using PV = nRT, we can find the pressure.

Wait, but I don't see how that helps with the work. Because work depends on the process. Since it's a reversible expansion, perhaps it's an isothermal expansion, and the work is calculated using that formula.

Wait, but I don't have V1. Oh wait, perhaps the initial volume is zero, but that's not possible. Alternatively, perhaps the expansion is against an external pressure, but then I need P_ext.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the gas is expanding from a certain volume to 12.7 dm³, and the work done is calculated for the reversible path between these two points. But without knowing V1, I can't compute it.

Wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated than it needs to be. Maybe the question is actually asking for the work done when the gas expands from its initial state (as a solid, perhaps?), but that doesn't make sense. Methane is a gas at 310 K.

Wait, perhaps the expansion is from a state where the gas was at a lower volume to 12.7 dm³, but I don't know what that lower volume is. Hmm.

Wait a minute, perhaps the problem is implying that the expansion is from the volume that the gas would occupy under standard temperature and pressure. But STP is 0°C (273 K) and 1 atm, but the problem states that data is for 298 K unless stated otherwise. Hmm, but the expansion is at 310 K. So maybe the initial state is at 310 K and a certain pressure, perhaps 1 atm.

Wait, maybe that's it. So initial state is at 310 K and 1 atm, and the gas expands to 12.7 dm³, which is the final volume. So I can compute the initial volume using the ideal gas law at 310 K and 1 atm, then find the work done during the reversible expansion from V1 to V2.

Yes, that makes sense. So first, find V1 when P = 1 atm, T =310 K, and n=0.2804 mol.

Calculating V1: V1 = nRT/P.

But need P in Pascals. 1 atm is 101325 Pa.

So V1 = (0.2804 mol) * (8.314 J/mol·K) * (310 K) / (101325 Pa).

Compute numerator: 0.2804 *8.314 ≈ 2.33, 2.33 *310 ≈ 722.3. So numerator is 722.3 J·mol⁻¹ → but wait, units: J/(m³·mol) ?

Wait, R is 8.314 J/(mol·K), so nRT has units J/(m³) when divided by P (Pa, which is J/m³). So V1 would be in m³.

So V1 = (0.2804 * 8.314 *310) /101325.

Compute numerator: 0.2804 *8.314 = let's compute it.

0.2804 *8 = 2.2432, 0.2804 *0.314 ≈ 0.0880. So total ≈ 2.3312.

2.3312 *310 = 722.472 J/(m³).

So V1 = 722.472 /101325 ≈ 0.007127 m³, which is 7.127 dm³.

So initial volume V1 is approximately 7.127 dm³, and final volume V2 is 12.7 dm³.

Now, the work done during reversible expansion is w = -nRT ln(V2/V1).

So plugging in the values:

n = 0.2804 mol, R=8.314 J/mol·K, T=310 K.

w = - (0.2804)(8.314)(310) ln(12.7/7.127)

Compute 12.7 /7.127 ≈1.782.

ln(1.782) ≈0.577.

So compute the product: 0.2804 *8.314 = approx 2.331, as before. 2.331 *310 ≈722.1.

So 722.1 *0.577 ≈ 416.6 J. But since work done by the system is negative, w ≈-416.6 J.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. The options are all around -150 J. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I shouldn't assume that the initial pressure is 1 atm. Maybe the expansion is not from 1 atm, but perhaps from a different initial pressure. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the work done when the gas expands from its initial volume (under given conditions) to a larger volume, but I'm not given the initial conditions.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming the initial state. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem states that the gas sample is 4.50 g and occupies 12.7 dm³ at 310 K. So perhaps the expansion is from a smaller volume to 12.7 dm³, but I don't know the initial volume. So without knowing V1, I can't compute the work done.

Wait, perhaps the question is that the expansion is against a constant external pressure, but then the work would be P_ext (V_final - V_initial). But without knowing P_ext or V_initial, I can't compute that either.

Wait, maybe the problem is about the work done during the expansion that led to the gas occupying 12.7 dm³ at 310 K. So perhaps the initial state is when the gas was in a container at a higher pressure and lower volume, and it expanded to 12.7 dm³. But without knowing the initial pressure or volume, I can't compute the work.

Wait, unless the expansion is from the molar volume at STP, but that doesn't fit with the temperature given.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the expansion is from the volume that the gas would occupy under standard conditions, but that's at 298 K, not 310 K.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the formula again. The work done during a reversible expansion is w = -nRT ln(V2/V1). But without knowing V1, I can't compute it. So unless V1 is the volume at a different condition.

Wait, perhaps the expansion is against atmospheric pressure, so P_ext is 1 atm. Then the work would be w = -P_ext (V2 - V1). But I don't have V1, the initial volume. So maybe V1 is the volume that the gas would occupy at 1 atm and 310 K.

Wait, that makes sense. So initial volume V1 is when P = 1 atm, T=310 K, and n=0.2804 mol. So V1 = nRT/P = (0.2804)(8.314)(310)/(101325).

Wait, I think I did this earlier, and V1 was about 7.127 dm³. Then the expansion is to V2 =12.7 dm³, so the work done would be w = -P_ext (V2 - V1) if it's against a constant external pressure. But wait, that's for irreversible expansion. For reversible, the work is the integral approach.

Wait, but if the expansion is reversible and isothermal, the work is w = -nRT ln(V2/V1). But if the expansion is against a constant external pressure and isothermal, then it's a different formula.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to compute w for the reversible expansion, which would require knowing V1 and V2, but without V1, I can't proceed. So perhaps the question is implying that the expansion is from a particular initial state, perhaps at the same temperature but different pressure.

Wait, maybe the problem is giving the volume after expansion, and the expansion is from a certain pressure to another. But without knowing the initial pressure, I can't find V1.

Wait, perhaps the initial pressure is the pressure that the gas had before expansion, but that's not given. Hmm, I'm stuck.

Wait, maybe the problem isn't about expansion but about the work done when the gas is allowed to expand reversibly
