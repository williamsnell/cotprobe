Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. The function is f(x) = ax^6 - bx^4 + x - 1. And we're told that f(2) equals 5. The question is asking for the value of f(-2). Hmm, okay.

Alright, let's break this down. I remember that for polynomials, sometimes plugging in negative numbers can have predictable patterns, especially when there are even and odd exponents involved. Let me think about each term in f(x).

So, the function is f(x) = a x^6 - b x^4 + x - 1. Let's look at each term when we substitute x = 2 and x = -2.

First, for x^6. Well, 2^6 is 64, and (-2)^6 is also 64 because any even power of a negative number is positive. So the term a x^6 will be the same whether x is 2 or -2. Same with x^4: 2^4 is 16, (-2)^4 is 16 as well. So the terms involving a and b, ax^6 and -bx^4, will evaluate to the same value at x=2 and x=-2.

Now, the other terms are x and -1. The x term is straightforward: at x=2, it's 2, and at x=-2, it's -2. The constant term, -1, stays the same in both cases.

So if I write out f(2) and f(-2), maybe I can find a relationship between them.

Let's compute f(2): a*(2)^6 - b*(2)^4 + 2 - 1. That's 64a - 16b + 2 -1, which simplifies to 64a -16b +1. And we know f(2) = 5, so 64a -16b +1 =5. Hmm, subtract 1 from both sides: 64a -16b =4. Let me write that equation as equation (1): 64a -16b =4.

Now, what about f(-2)? Let's compute that. f(-2) = a*(-2)^6 - b*(-2)^4 + (-2) -1. So that's a*64 - b*16 + (-2) -1. Which simplifies to 64a -16b -3. Wait, because (-2) is -2, and minus 1 makes it -3.

Oh wait, I see something here. Let's write f(-2) in terms of what we have. f(-2) = (64a -16b) -3. But from equation (1), 64a -16b is 4. So substituting that in, f(-2) =4 -3 =1.

So the answer should be 1, which is option B, I think. Let me double-check my steps.

So f(2) gives 64a -16b =4. f(-2) is 64a -16b minus 3. So 4 -3 is 1. Yep, that makes sense. So the answer is B.

To determine the value of \( f(-2) \) for the function \( f(x) = ax^6 - bx^4 + x - 1 \), we start by analyzing the given information and the structure of the polynomial.

1. **Given**: \( f(2) = 5 \). Substituting \( x = 2 \) into the function:
   \[
   f(2) = a(2^6) - b(2^4) + 2 - 1 = 64a - 16b + 1
   \]
   Since \( f(2) = 5 \), we have:
   \[
   64a - 16b + 1 = 5 \implies 64a - 16b = 4 \tag{1}
   \]

2. **Compute \( f(-2) \)**: Substituting \( x = -2 \) into the function:
   \[
   f(-2) = a(-2)^6 - b(-2)^4 + (-2) - 1 = 64a - 16b - 2 - 1 = 64a - 16b - 3
   \]

3. **Substitute from Equation (1)**: From \( 64a - 16b = 4 \), we substitute this into the expression for \( f(-2) \):
   \[
   f(-2) = 4 - 3 = 1
   \]

Thus, the value of \( f(-2) \) is \( 1 \).
