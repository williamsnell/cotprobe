Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this problem about the factory purchasing a machine. Let me break it down step by step. Okay, the machine costs $600,000, and it's supposed to reduce production costs by $200,000 each year. The desired rate of return is 20%. I need to find the minimum life the machine must have to meet this rate of return.

Hmm, I remember this has to do with the payback period or maybe net present value. Oh wait, since it's about the rate of return, I think I should use the discounted cash flow method, specifically the net present value (NPV) approach. Because we're looking for when the NPV becomes zero, which would indicate the minimum life needed to achieve the desired return.

Right, the formula for NPV is the sum of the present values of all cash flows. The initial investment is a cash outflow, and the annual savings are cash inflows. So the NPV would be the initial cost minus the present value of the annual savings.

The initial cost is $600,000. Each year, the saving is $200,000. The discount rate is 20%, or 0.2. So for each year t, the present value of the saving is 200,000 divided by (1 + 0.2)^t.

I think I need to calculate the NPV for different numbers of years until I find when it's zero or just turns positive. Let's see.

So the formula is:

NPV = -600,000 + 200,000/(1.2)^1 + 200,000/(1.2)^2 + ... + 200,000/(1.2)^n

We need to find the smallest n where NPV is greater than or equal to zero.

Alternatively, I can model this as the present value of an annuity. The present value (PV) of an annuity formula is PV = PMT * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n)/r]. So, in this case, the PV of the savings would be 200,000 * [(1 - (1.2)^-n)/0.2]. We set this equal to the initial cost to find the break-even point.

So, 200,000 * [(1 - (1.2)^-n)/0.2] = 600,000

Let me simplify that:

Divide both sides by 200,000: (1 - (1.2)^-n)/0.2 = 3

Multiply both sides by 0.2: 1 - (1.2)^-n = 0.6

Subtract 1: -(1.2)^-n = -0.4 → (1.2)^-n = 0.6

Take reciprocals on both sides: (1.2)^n = 1/0.6 ≈ 1.6667

Now, solve for n using logarithms. Take ln on both sides:

ln(1.2^n) = ln(1.6667)

n * ln(1.2) ≈ ln(1.6667)

Calculate ln(1.2) ≈ 0.1823, ln(1.6667) ≈ 0.5108

So n ≈ 0.5108 / 0.1823 ≈ 2.8 years.

Wait, that can't be right. Because if n is about 2.8 years, the machine would pay back in less than 3 years. But looking at the options, the choices are mostly 5 years or more. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, wait. Oh no, I think I confused the formula. Let me double-check. The present value of the annuity formula is correct, but let me re-express the equation again.

Wait, the equation was set as the PV of the annuity equals the initial cost. So:

PV = 200,000 * [ (1 - (1.2)^-n ) / 0.2 ] = 600,000

So 200,000 * [ (1 - (1.2)^-n ) / 0.2 ] = 600,000

Divide both sides by 200,000:

[ (1 - (1.2)^-n ) / 0.2 ] = 3

Multiply both sides by 0.2:

1 - (1.2)^-n = 0.6

So (1.2)^-n = 0.4 → 1/(1.2)^n = 0.4 → (1.2)^n = 1/0.4 = 2.5

Oh wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because 1 - (1.2)^-n = 0.6 → (1.2)^-n = 0.4, not 0.6. So yeah, that's where I went wrong.

So (1.2)^n = 1/0.4 = 2.5

Now, taking natural logs:

ln(1.2^n) = ln(2.5)

n * ln(1.2) ≈ ln(2.5)

ln(1.2) ≈ 0.1823, ln(2.5) ≈ 0.9163

n ≈ 0.9163 / 0.1823 ≈ 5.03 years.

Ah, that makes more sense. So n is approximately 5.03 years. Therefore, the machine must last just a bit more than 5 years to achieve the desired 20% return.

Looking back at the options:

Option H: exactly 5 years

Option D: slightly greater than 5 years.

Wait, but n is approximately 5.03, which is just a bit over 5. So the minimum life must be slightly more than 5 years. So the correct answer would be D: slightly greater than 5 years.

Alternatively, sometimes in multiple-choice questions, they might round to the nearest whole number. Let me check by calculating the NPV at exactly 5 years.

Calculate NPV when n=5:

PV of annuity = 200,000 * [(1 - (1.2)^-5)/0.2 ]

Calculate (1.2)^5: 1.2^1=1.2; 1.2^2=1.44; 1.2^3=1.728; 1.2^4=2.0736; 1.2^5=2.48832.

So (1.2)^-5 = 1/2.48832 ≈ 0.40188.

So (1 - 0.40188) = 0.59812.

Multiply by 200,000/0.2 → wait, no, the PV annuity formula is 200,000 * (0.59812 / 0.2 )? Wait, wait no. The formula is PMT * [ (1 - (1+r)^-n ) / r ]

Wait, so PMT is 200,000, r is 0.2, n is 5.

So [ (1 - (1.2)^-5 ) / 0.2 ] = (1 - 0.40188)/0.2 → 0.59812 / 0.2 ≈ 2.9906.

Multiply by 200,000 → 200,000 * 2.9906 ≈ 597,  let's calculate 200k * 2.9906 = 200,000 * 3 = 600,000. Minus 200,000 * 0.0094 = 200,000 * 0.01 is 2000, so 0.0094 is about 1880. So 600,000 - 1,880 = 598,120.

So the PV of the annuity at n=5 is approximately $598,120. The initial cost is $600,000, so the NPV is 598,120 - 600,000 = -$1,880. That's negative. So at exactly 5 years, the NPV is still slightly negative, meaning the return is just below 20%.

So we need a little more than 5 years. Let me try n=5.03 years.

Wait, perhaps I can compute more accurately. Let's see, the NPV is zero when n is approximately 5.03, which is just a bit over 5. So the machine needs to last slightly more than 5 years.

Looking back at the options, option D is "slightly greater than 5 years", and option H is exactly 5 years.

So the correct answer is D.

Wait, but let me check the options again:

Options:

A: 4-5

B: more than 7

C:5-6

D: slightly >5

E: exactly 6

H: exactly 5

So according to our calculation, it's just over 5, so D is the correct choice.
</think>

To determine the minimum life the machine must have to assure a 20% rate of return, we use the net present value (NPV) approach. The machine costs $600,000 and reduces production costs by $200,000 annually. The desired rate of return is 20%, so we calculate the present value of the annual savings and compare it to the initial cost.

The present value of an annuity formula is:

\[
PV = PMT \times \frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}{r}
\]

Here:
- \(PMT = 200,000\) (annual savings),
- \(r = 0.2\) (discount rate),
- \(n\) is the number of years.

We set the present value of the savings equal to the initial cost:

\[
200,000 \times \frac{1 - (1.2)^{-n}}{0.2} = 600,000
\]

Simplify:

\[
\frac{1 - (1.2)^{-n}}{0.2} = 3
\]

\[
1 - (1.2)^{-n} = 0.6
\]

\[
(1.2)^{-n} = 0.4
\]

Taking reciprocals:

\[
(1.2)^n = \frac{1}{0.4} = 2.5
\]

Taking natural logarithms:

\[
\ln(1.2^n) = \ln(2.5)
\]

\[
n \times \ln(1.2) = \ln(2.5)
\]

\[
n = \frac{\ln(2.5)}{\ln(1.2)} \approx \frac{0.9163}{0.1823} \approx 5.03
\]

Thus, the machine must last slightly more than 5 years to achieve the desired 20% rate of return. At exactly 5 years, the NPV is still slightly negative, indicating the minimum life must be just over 5 years.

From the options:
- **D: slightly greater than 5 years** is the correct answer.
