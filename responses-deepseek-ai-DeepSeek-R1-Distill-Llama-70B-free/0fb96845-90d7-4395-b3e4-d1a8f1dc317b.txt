Question:

Before the close of evidence in a federal negligence trial, the defendant submitted a proposed jury instruction on contributory negligence. Before instructing the jury, the judge informed the parties of the instructions she would give, which did not include the defendant's contributory negligence instruction or any instruction on contributory negligence. Neither party objected, either then or after the judge had given the instructions. The jury after the judge had given the instructions. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, and the judge entered judgment on the verdict. The defendant would like to appeal the verdict on the ground that the judge should have instructed the jury on contributory negligence. Has the defendant preserved the issue for appeal?

Options:

A: Yes, because the judge's failure to give the defendant's contributory negligence instruction amounted to a ruling on the instruction.
B: Yes, because the defendant's proposed instruction was a valid point of appeal.
C: No, because the defendant did not raise the issue of contributory negligence during the trial.
D: Yes, because the defendant submitted a proposed instruction on contributory negligence.
E: No, because the defendant did not reiterate the need for the instruction after it was not included.
F: Yes, because the judge did not give an instruction on contributory negligence.
G: Yes, because the defendant's proposed instruction was ignored by the judge.
H: No, because the defendant failed to object after the judge informed the parties of the instructions she would give.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about preserving an issue for appeal in a federal negligence trial. Hmm, I need to figure out whether the defendant has properly preserved the issue of contributory negligence for appeal. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the scenario is that before the evidence closed, the defendant submitted a proposed jury instruction on contributory negligence. Then, the judge told both parties what instructions she would give, and it didn't include the defendant's instruction or any on contributory negligence. Neither party objected at that time, nor did they object after the judge gave the instructions. The jury came back with a verdict for the plaintiff, and judgment was entered. Now the defendant wants to appeal, arguing that the judge should have instructed on contributory negligence. The question is whether the issue was preserved for appeal.

I remember that to preserve an issue for appeal, the party usually has to object at the appropriate time. For jury instructions, I think the process involves submitting proposed instructions, then if the court rejects them, the party must object on the record. In federal courts, the rules require that the party must object to the jury instructions or the omission of certain instructions before the jury is charged. If they don't, they might waive that issue on appeal.

So in this case, the defendant submitted the instruction. Then the judge told them she wasn't including it. The defendant didn't object then, nor after the instructions were given. So they didn't make a timely objection. Without that objection, the issue isn't preserved.

Looking at the options:

Option A says yes because the judge didn't give the instruction, which was a ruling. But wait, I think just submitting a proposed instruction isn't enough. You have to object when the court says it's not including it.

Option B says yes because it's a valid point, but validity isn't the issue here—preservation is. So B might not be correct.

Option C says no because the defendant didn't raise the issue during trial. But wait, they did submit a proposed instruction, which might count as raising it. But did they object at the right time? So C might not be the best.

Option D says yes because the defendant submitted the instruction. But submission alone isn't enough; they need to object after the court's decision.

Option E says no because they didn't reiterate after it wasn't included. That sounds right. If they didn't bring it up again when the judge informed them, they didn't preserve it.

Option F says yes because the judge didn't give the instruction. But again, without objection, it's not preserved.

Option G says yes because the judge ignored it. But same issue—no objection.

Option H says no because the defendant didn't object after being informed. That matches what I was thinking. If they didn't object when the judge told them the instructions, then the issue isn't preserved.

So the correct answer should be E or H. Wait, let me think again. The initial submission of the instruction is part of the process. Then, when the judge informs the parties of the instructions she'll give, that's the time to object. If they don't object then, or after the instructions are given, they've waived it.

Looking at the options, E says no because they didn't reiterate the need after it wasn't included. H says no because they didn't object after the judge informed them.

Wait, the question says neither party objected then or after the instructions were given. So the defendant didn't object at the time the judge informed them, nor after. So the issue wasn't preserved because they failed to object when the judge told them the instructions. So the correct answer would be H.

Wait, another thought: The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 51, which governs objections to jury instructions. Rule 51(b) says that a party who objects to an instruction or the failure to give an instruction must do so on the record, stating distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds for the objection. This must be done before the jury is instructed, unless the court allows it after. So the defendant here didn't object when the judge told them she wasn't including it, so they didn't preserve it under Rule 51.

So the answer should be H: No, because the defendant failed to object after the judge informed the parties of the instructions she would give.

I think that's the correct reasoning.

To preserve an issue for appeal regarding jury instructions, a party must object on the record when the court informs them of the instructions it will give, specifically stating the objections and grounds. In this case, the defendant submitted a proposed instruction on contributory negligence, but when the judge informed the parties that she would not include it, the defendant did not object. Additionally, the defendant did not object after the instructions were given. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 51, this failure to object means the issue was not preserved for appeal.

- **Option A**: Incorrect. Submitting a proposed instruction is not enough; a timely objection is required.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The validity of the issue is not the question—preservation is.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The defendant did raise the issue by submitting the instruction but failed to object afterward.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Submitting the instruction alone does not preserve the issue without a subsequent objection.
- **Option E**: Correct in substance but less precise. The key omission was the failure to object when the judge informed the parties of the instructions.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The judge's omission alone does not preserve the issue without an objection.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. Ignoring the instruction does not preserve the issue without an objection.
- **Option H**: Correct. The defendant failed to object when the judge informed the parties of the instructions, as required by Rule 51.

The best answer is **H**.

H
