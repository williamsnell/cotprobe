Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the tax rate for the city of Booksville. Hmm, let's see what I've got here. The assessed valuation of the property is $50,600,000, and they require property taxes of $4,500,000. I need to find the tax rate per $100 and per $1,000, carrying the division to five decimal places. Oh wait, wait, actually, the question asks for the tax rate as a percentage, I think. Because the options are given in percentages. So maybe I'm just calculating the overall tax rate and then expressing it per $100 or per $1,000.

Alright, let me think. The basic formula for tax rate is (Total Tax Levied / Assessed Valuation) * 100 to get the percentage. So that would be (4,500,000 / 50,600,000) * 100. Let me compute that.

Wait, let me calculate 4.5 million divided by 50.6 million first. So 4,500,000 divided by 50,600,000. Let me convert them to numbers without the commas for easier calculation. So 4,500,000 is 4.5e6, and 50,600,000 is 5.06e7. So 4.5e6 / 5.06e7 equals 4.5 / 50.6 (since 1e6/1e7 is 0.1). Wait, no, 4.5e6 divided by 5.06e7 equals (4.5 / 50.6) * (1e6 / 1e7) which is (4.5/50.6)*0.1. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute 4.5 divided by 50.6.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should do it step by step. Let's compute 4,500,000 divided by 50,600,000. Let's write this as 4.5 / 50.6 because both are in millions. So 4.5 divided by 50.6 equals approximately... Let me do the division.

So 50.6 goes into 4.5 how many times? Well, 50.6 is larger than 4.5, so it's 0. something. Let me compute 4.5 ÷ 50.6. Let me set it up as 4.5 ÷ 50.6.

Hmm, perhaps I'll do long division here. 50.6 into 4.5000.

Wait, 50.6 is bigger than 4.5, so we consider 50.6 into 45.0000 (since 4.5 is 45 when we add a decimal point and zeros). Wait, no, wait, 4.5 is 4.5000, so 50.6 into 4.5000. So that's 0.089... Let me check.

Wait, another approach: 50.6 times 0.08 is 4.048. Because 50 * 0.08 is 4, and 0.6 * 0.08 is 0.048, so 4.048. Then 4.5 minus 4.048 is 0.452. So that's after 0.08, we have 0.452 left. Now, 50.6 into 0.452. Let me compute that.

0.452 divided by 50.6. Let's move the decimal points: 452 divided by 50600. That's 452 / 50600. Let's compute that. 50600 goes into 452 how many times? It's 0.00893... Approximately 0.00893. So adding that to the 0.08 gives 0.08893. So about 0.08893, which is 8.893%.

Wait, but wait, let me check that again because I'm getting confused. So 50.6 * 0.08893 equals approximately 4.5, right? Let me check: 50.6 * 0.08 is 4.048. 50.6 * 0.008 is 0.4048. So 0.088 is 4.048 + 0.4048 = 4.4528. Then 50.6 * 0.00093 is approximately 0.047058. So adding that to 4.4528 gives about 4.4998, which is close to 4.5. So yes, 0.08893 is right.

So 4.5 /50.6 ≈ 0.08893, which is 8.893%. So that's the tax rate. So looking at the options, which one is 8.893%? Let's check the options.

Options:

A: 6.893%

B:12.893%

C:7.893%

D:9.893%

E:5.500%

F:11.893%

G:7.500%

H:9.500%

I:8.893%

J:10.893%

So option I is 8.893%. So the correct answer should be I.

Wait, but wait, the question also mentions per $100 and per $1,000. Oh, but in this calculation, I think the percentage itself is 8.893%, so per $100 would be 0.08893 per $100, which is 8.893%, and per $1,000 would be 0.8893 per $1,000, which is 88.93% of $1,000, but that seems high. Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the tax rate is a percentage applied to the assessed value. So per $100 of assessed value, the tax is a certain amount.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is asking for the tax rate, which is a percentage. So the calculated tax rate is 8.893%, which would be option I.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute 4,500,000 divided by 50,600,000 exactly.

4,500,000 ÷ 50,600,000 = 4.5 / 50.6 ≈ 0.08893. So 8.893%.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer is I.

The tax rate is calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Tax Rate} = \left( \frac{\text{Total Tax Levied}}{\text{Assessed Valuation}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\text{Tax Rate} = \left( \frac{4,500,000}{50,600,000} \right) \times 100
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\text{Tax Rate} = \left( \frac{4.5}{50.6} \right) \times 100 \approx 8.893\%
\]

Thus, the tax rate is approximately **8.893%**. Comparing this result to the provided options, the correct answer is:

**I: 8.893%**
