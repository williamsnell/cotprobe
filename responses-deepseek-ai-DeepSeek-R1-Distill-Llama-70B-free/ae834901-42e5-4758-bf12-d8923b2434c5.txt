Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about antiviral drugs and which ones target herpes viruses. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on my pharmacology, but I'll try to work through this.

The question is asking which of the options inhibit herpes viruses. The options are A through D: Amantadine, Acyclovir, Oseltamivir, and Azidothymidine.

First, I should recall what each of these drugs does. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Amantadine. I remember that Amantadine is used for influenza. It was one of the earlier antiviral drugs. I think it's used to treat and prevent flu A virus. But wait, does it have anything to do with herpes? I don't think so. Herpes is a different family of viruses, like Herpes simplex or Varicella-zoster. So probably A isn't the right answer.

Option B: Acyclovir. Oh yeah, I'm pretty sure Acyclovir is an antiviral specifically for herpes viruses. It's commonly used for treating herpes simplex virus (like cold sores or genital herpes) and also Varicella-zoster, which causes chickenpox and shingles. So B sounds like a correct choice.

Option C: Oseltamivir. That rings a bell. Oseltamivir is another antiviral, but I think it's for influenza too, like Tamiflu. It's used to treat and prevent flu, especially type A and B. So it's not for herpes. So C is probably not the right answer.

Option D: Azidothymidine. Wait, I think that's also known as AZT. I remember AZT is an antiretroviral drug used to treat HIV/AIDS. It's a nucleoside analog that inhibits the reverse transcriptase enzyme of HIV. So it targets HIV, not herpes. So D isn't the right choice either.

Putting it all together, the only drug among the options that targets herpes viruses is Acyclovir, which is option B. So the answer should be B.

The correct answer is B: Acyclovir. Acyclovir is an antiviral drug specifically used to treat infections caused by herpes viruses, such as herpes simplex virus and Varicella-zoster virus. The other options target different viruses: Amantadine and Oseltamivir are used for influenza, while Azidothymidine (AZT) is used for HIV.

Answer: B
