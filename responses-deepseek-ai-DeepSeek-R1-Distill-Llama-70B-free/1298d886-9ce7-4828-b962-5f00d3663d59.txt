Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the correct fiscal policy to remedy a recession. Hmm, I remember from my economics class that fiscal policy involves the government using its spending and taxation to influence the overall level of economic activity. 

Wait, when the economy is in a recession, that means it's not producing as much as it could, right? People are losing jobs, businesses aren't making as much money. So, the government needs to do something to stimulate the economy.

I think there are two main approaches: expansionary and contractionary fiscal policy. Expansionary is when the government wants to increase economic activity, so they would probably increase government spending or cut taxes. That makes sense because if the government spends more, it creates jobs and puts money into the economy. Cutting taxes means people have more money in their pockets to spend, which also boosts economic activity.

Looking at the options, option A says the government should run a deficit. Oh, right, because if the government spends more than it takes in through taxes, that's a deficit. So during a recession, the government might intentionally spend more to stimulate the economy. That sounds like expansionary fiscal policy.

Option B suggests running a surplus. Wait, a surplus is when the government takes in more than it spends. That's usually during good economic times when they might save money or pay off debt. But during a recession, running a surplus would take money out of the economy, which doesn't seem helpful. So I don't think B is correct.

Option C says increased taxes and government spending. Hmm, increasing taxes would take money away from people, which might reduce their spending. But increasing government spending could help. So is this a balanced approach? Not sure. But during a recession, increasing taxes might worsen the situation because people have less to spend. So maybe C isn't the right choice.

Option D suggests decreasing both government spending and taxes. Decreasing spending would reduce government outlays, which might lower demand for goods and services, which isn't good in a recession. Lower taxes would put more money in people's pockets, which is good, but if you lower spending, the overall effect might not be enough to stimulate the economy. Plus, lower spending could lead to more job losses, which isn't helpful during a recession.

Wait, let me think again. So, in a recession, the goal is to increase aggregate demand. The government can do this by spending more (which directly increases demand) or cutting taxes (which increases disposable income for households, letting them spend more). Either way, this would likely lead to a budget deficit because the government is spending more than it's taking in.

So looking back at the options, option A says the government should run a deficit. That aligns with the idea of increasing spending or cutting taxes to boost the economy. So I think A is the correct answer.

Another way to think about it is Keynesian economics, which suggests that during a recession, the government should step in and increase its spending because private investment and consumption are low. So that supports option A as well.

The correct fiscal policy to remedy a recession involves increasing aggregate demand to stimulate economic activity. During a recession, the government can achieve this by running a deficit, either through increased government spending or tax cuts. Increased spending directly boosts demand, while tax cuts provide households with more disposable income to spend. Running a surplus (Option B) would reduce demand, worsening the recession. Option C, which combines increased taxes and spending, is counterproductive because higher taxes reduce disposable income. Option D, which decreases both spending and taxes, risks lowering demand further due to reduced government outlays. Therefore, the appropriate choice is to run a deficit to stimulate the economy.
