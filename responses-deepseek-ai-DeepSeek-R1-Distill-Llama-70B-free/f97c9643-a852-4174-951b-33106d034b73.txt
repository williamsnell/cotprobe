Question:

What is the law of diminishing marginal utility?

Options:

A: This principle suggests that as more units of a good are consumed, the total utility decreases.
B: The law asserts that the marginal utility of a good increases at a decreasing rate as consumption increases.
C: The law suggests that utility does not change with consumption and remains static over time.
D: It states that each additional unit of consumption yields greater utility than the previous one, indefinitely.
E: It's a rule that says the first unit of a good or service consumed yields the least utility.
F: The Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility refers to the fact that as successive units are consumed, the utility derived from each additional unit decreases beyond some point.
G: It indicates that the utility derived from each additional unit consumed remains constant no matter how many units are consumed.
H: It's the principle that states that as the quantity of a good decreases, the utility derived from each additional unit increases.
I: The law states that utility increases with each unit consumed.
J: The law claims that consumers derive equal utility from each additional unit consumed, regardless of the quantity already consumed.

Okay, so I have this question about the law of diminishing marginal utility, and I need to figure out the correct answer from the options A to J. Let's start by recalling what I know about this topic.

From my economics classes, I remember that the law of diminishing marginal utility is a fundamental concept in consumer behavior. It's about how the satisfaction or utility a person gets from consuming a good changes as they consume more units of it. The basic idea is that as you consume more of something, each additional unit gives you less satisfaction than the previous one. Like, if you're eating pizza slices, the first slice is super satisfying, the second is good, but by the third or fourth, each additional slice doesn't taste as great and might even make you feel worse.

So the key here is that marginal utility decreases with each additional unit consumed after a certain point. Marginal utility is the additional satisfaction from one more unit. So, the law is saying that this marginal utility diminishes as you consume more.

Now let's look at the options one by one.

Option A: "This principle suggests that as more units of a good are consumed, the total utility decreases." Hmm, wait. I thought that total utility might increase up to a point but then start to decrease, but maybe not. Actually, total utility could continue to rise, but at a decreasing rate. For example, each slice of pizza adds to total utility, but each subsequent slice adds less. So total utility increases but marginal utility decreases. So A might not be correct because it says total utility decreases, which isn't necessarily true. It's the marginal utility that decreases, not the total.

Option B: "The law asserts that the marginal utility of a good increases at a decreasing rate as consumption increases." Hmm, that sounds a bit confusing. Wait, if marginal utility is increasing but at a decreasing rate, that's not diminishing. Like, if each additional unit gives more utility but the increase in utility is slowing down. That doesn't sound right because the law is about marginal utility decreasing, not increasing.

Option C: "The law suggests that utility does not change with consumption and remains static over time." No, that's the opposite. Utility does change, and it diminishes as more is consumed. So C is incorrect.

Option D: "It states that each additional unit of consumption yields greater utility than the previous one, indefinitely." That's the opposite of diminishing marginal utility. If each unit gives more utility, that's increasing, not diminishing. So D is wrong.

Option E: "It's a rule that says the first unit of a good or service consumed yields the least utility." Wait, that doesn't sound right. Actually, the first unit usually gives the highest utility, and then each subsequent unit gives less. So E is wrong because it claims the first unit yields the least.

Option F: "The Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility refers to the fact that as successive units are consumed, the utility derived from each additional unit decreases beyond some point." This sounds correct. It's saying that after a certain number of units, each additional unit gives less utility. So F aligns with what I remember.

Option G: "It indicates that the utility derived from each additional unit consumed remains constant no matter how many units are consumed." No, that's not right because utility changesâ€”it decreases as more units are consumed beyond a point.

Option H: "It's the principle that states that as the quantity of a good decreases, the utility derived from each additional unit increases." Wait, that sounds like the law of increasing marginal utility when quantity decreases. Or maybe it's about scarcity? Hmm, but the question is about diminishing marginal utility. So H is talking about decreasing quantity leading to higher utility per unit, which is different. So H is not the correct answer.

Option I: "The law states that utility increases with each unit consumed." That's the opposite of diminishing marginal utility. So I is incorrect.

Option J: "The law claims that consumers derive equal utility from each additional unit consumed, regardless of the quantity already consumed." No, because it's not about equal utility; it's about each additional unit giving less utility. So J is wrong.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be F. It correctly states that each additional unit beyond a certain point provides less utility. The other options either describe the opposite situation or confuse total and marginal utility.

The law of diminishing marginal utility explains that as consumers use more units of a good, the additional satisfaction (marginal utility) they derive from each subsequent unit decreases beyond a certain point. This concept is a cornerstone in understanding consumer behavior and utility maximization.

Analyzing the options:

- **A** is incorrect because it refers to total utility decreasing, which is not necessarily true; total utility may continue to increase, but at a decreasing rate.
- **B** is incorrect as it describes marginal utility increasing, albeit at a decreasing rate, which contradicts the law.
- **C** is incorrect because utility does change with consumption and diminishes as more units are consumed.
- **D** is incorrect as it suggests increasing utility with each additional unit, which is the opposite of diminishing marginal utility.
- **E** is incorrect because the first unit typically yields the highest utility, not the least.
- **F** is correct as it accurately describes the law: marginal utility decreases beyond a certain point as more units are consumed.
- **G** is incorrect because utility does not remain constant; it decreases with additional consumption.
- **H** is incorrect as it refers to utility increasing when quantity decreases, which is unrelated to the law.
- **I** is incorrect because it suggests utility increases with each unit, which is the opposite of the law.
- **J** is incorrect because it implies equal utility per unit, which is not the case.

The correct answer is **F**, as it aligns with the definition of the law of diminishing marginal utility.
