Okay, so I've got this problem here about direct proportionality. Hmm, let me try to remember what that means. I think when two things are directly proportional, one is a constant multiple of the other. So if x and y are directly proportional, that means x equals some constant k times y, right? Like x = k * y.

The problem says that x is 3 when y is 8. So I can plug those values in to find the constant k. Let's see, 3 equals k times 8. To find k, I divide both sides by 8. So k is 3 divided by 8, which is 0.375. Got that.

Now the question is asking for the value of x when y is 13. Using the same formula, x equals k times y. Since we know k is 0.375, we plug in y =13. So x = 0.375 * 13. Let me calculate that. 0.375 times 10 is 3.75, and 0.375 times 3 is 1.125. Adding those together, 3.75 + 1.125 equals 4.875. So x should be 4.875 when y is 13.

Wait, let me double-check just to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Another way to think about it is setting up a proportion because it's direct variation. So when x is 3, y is 8, and when y is 13, x is what? So (x1)/(y1) = (x2)/(y2). That would be 3/8 = x/13. Solving for x, cross-multiplying gives 3*13 = 8x. So 39 = 8x, which makes x 39/8. Let me compute that. 39 divided by 8 is 4.875. Yep, same result as before. So I'm confident that's the right answer.

Looking back at the options, option G is 4.875. So the answer should be G.

To solve the problem of finding the value of \( x \) when \( y = 13 \) given that \( x \) and \( y \) are directly proportional and \( x = 3 \) when \( y = 8 \), we start by using the relationship for direct proportionality:

\[
x = k \cdot y
\]

Here, \( k \) is the constant of proportionality. Substituting the given values \( x = 3 \) and \( y = 8 \), we can solve for \( k \):

\[
3 = k \cdot 8 \quad \Rightarrow \quad k = \frac{3}{8} = 0.375
\]

Now, using this constant \( k \), we calculate \( x \) when \( y = 13 \):

\[
x = k \cdot y = 0.375 \cdot 13 = 4.875
\]

To verify, we can also use the proportionality relationship:

\[
\frac{x_1}{y_1} = \frac{x_2}{y_2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{3}{8} = \frac{x}{13}
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[
3 \cdot 13 = 8 \cdot x \quad \Rightarrow \quad 39 = 8x \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \frac{39}{8} = 4.875
\]

Both methods confirm that \( x = 4.875 \) when \( y = 13 \). Comparing this result with the provided options, the correct answer is:

G: 4.875
