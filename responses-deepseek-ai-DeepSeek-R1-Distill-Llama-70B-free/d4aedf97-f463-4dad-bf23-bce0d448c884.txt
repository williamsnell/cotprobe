Okay, so I've got this question here about finding the median of a set of numbers. Hmm, I remember that the median is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in order. But wait, let me think through this step by step to make sure I don't make a mistake.

The numbers given are 5, 8, 12, 3, 9. First, I think I should sort them from smallest to largest. Let me list them out again to make sure I don't mix them up. So, the numbers are 5, 8, 12, 3, 9. When I put them in order, the smallest is 3, then 5, next is 8, followed by 9, and the largest is 12. So the sorted list is 3, 5, 8, 9, 12.

Now, since there are five numbers here, the median will be the third one because there are two numbers before it and two after. Let me count: first is 3, second is 5, third is 8. So the median should be 8.

Wait, but let me double-check. Sometimes I get confused with even and odd numbers of values. Oh right, when the count is odd, like 5 here, the median is the middle number. If it were even, we'd average the two middle ones. But here, it's definitely the middle number which is 8.

Looking at the options, option B is 8, so that must be the correct answer. I don't think I made any mistakes in sorting or counting. Yeah, I'm pretty confident now.

The numbers provided are 5, 8, 12, 3, and 9. To find the median, they must be sorted in ascending order: 3, 5, 8, 9, 12. Since there are five numbers (an odd count), the median is the middle value, which is the third number in the sorted list. Here, the third number is 8. 

From the given options, the correct answer is:

B: 8
