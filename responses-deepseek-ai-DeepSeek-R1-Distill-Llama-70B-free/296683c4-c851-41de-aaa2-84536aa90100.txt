The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

An assembly line machine is supposed to turn out ball bearings with a diameter of 1.25 centimeters. Each morning the first 30 bearings produced are pulled and measured. If their mean diameter is under 1.23 centimeters or over 1.27 centimeters, the machinery is stopped and an engineer is called to make adjustments before production is resumed. The quality control procedure may be viewed as a hypothesis test with the null hypothesis H0: μ = 1.25 and the alternative hypothesis Ha: μ ≠ 1.25. The engineer is asked to make adjustments when the null hypothesis is rejected. In test terminology, what would a Type II error result in?

Options:

A: An incorrect assumption about the machinery's calibration
B: An unnecessary stoppage of the production process
C: Continued production of wrong size ball bearings
D: An unnecessary adjustment of the machinery
E: A warranted halt in production to adjust the machinery
F: A false alarm about the size of ball bearings
G: Continued production of proper size ball bearings

Okay, so I've got this statistics question here about hypothesis testing and Type II errors. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it.

The question is about a quality control procedure in a factory that makes ball bearings. The machine is supposed to produce bearings with a diameter of 1.25 cm. Every morning, the first 30 bearings are tested. If their average diameter is under 1.23 or over 1.27 cm, the machine stops, and an engineer comes to adjust it. 

The setup is a hypothesis test where the null hypothesis H0 is that the mean μ is 1.25 cm, and the alternative hypothesis Ha is that μ is not equal to 1.25. So, if they reject H0, the engineer adjusts the machinery.

The question is asking what a Type II error would result in. Type II errors... I remember that in hypothesis testing, there are two types of errors. Type I is when you reject the null hypothesis even though it's true. Type II is when you fail to reject the null even though it's false. So, Type II is kind of a "false negative."

In this context, the null hypothesis is that the machinery is correctly calibrated (μ=1.25). So if the machinery is actually producing bearings outside the acceptable range (like under 1.23 or over 1.27), but the test doesn't detect that and fails to reject H0, that's a Type II error.

So what happens in a Type II error here? The machinery is making wrong-sized bearings, but the test doesn't catch it. So the production continues even though it's producing defective parts. That would mean the factory keeps making bad bearings without stopping the machine.

Looking at the options, let's see:

A: Incorrect assumption about calibration. Hmm, maybe, but not sure how it ties to action.

B: Unnecessary stoppage. No, Type II is failing to stop when you should. So this is the opposite; a Type I error would cause unnecessary stopping.

C: Continued production of wrong size bearings. Yes, that sounds about right. Because the test didn't catch the problem, so production goes on making defective products.

D: Unnecessary adjustment. No, that's more like a Type I error where you adjust when you shouldn't.

E: Halt production correctly. That's a correct action, not an error.

F: False alarm about size. That's Type I error, a false positive.

G: Continued correct production. That's if everything is okay, but that's not an error case.

So the correct answer should be option C: Continued production of wrong size ball bearings.

A Type II error occurs when a hypothesis test fails to reject the null hypothesis even though it is false. In this scenario, the null hypothesis \( H_0: \mu = 1.25 \) assumes the machinery is correctly calibrated. If the machinery is actually producing bearings outside the acceptable range (e.g., under 1.23 cm or over 1.27 cm), but the test does not detect this, a Type II error occurs. As a result, the production of incorrectly sized ball bearings continues unchecked. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect assumption about calibration is vague and does not directly describe the consequence of a Type II error.  
- **B**: Unnecessary stoppage refers to a Type I error, not a Type II error.  
- **C**: Continued production of wrong size ball bearings accurately describes the consequence of a Type II error, as defective products are not detected and production continues.  
- **D**: Unnecessary adjustment refers to a Type I error, where the machinery is stopped and adjusted even though it is functioning correctly.  
- **E**: A warranted halt in production is a correct action, not an error.  
- **F**: A false alarm about size is a Type I error, not a Type II error.  
- **G**: Continued production of proper size ball bearings describes a correct scenario, not an error.  

The correct answer is **C: Continued production of wrong size ball bearings**.
