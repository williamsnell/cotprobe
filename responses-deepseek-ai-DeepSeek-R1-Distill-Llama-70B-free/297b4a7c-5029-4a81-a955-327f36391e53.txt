Okay, so I have this question about a voltaic cell and calculating the standard free energy change, ΔG°. Hmm, I remember that voltaic cells involve redox reactions, and the cell potential is related to the free energy change. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the voltaic cell consists of two electrodes. One is silver in 1M silver nitrate, and the other is aluminum in 1M aluminum nitrate. The half-reactions given are:

1) Ag+ + e^- → Ag(s), E° = 0.80 V
2) Al^3+ + 3e^- → Al(s), E° = -1.66 V

Wait, I need to determine which one is the cathode and which is the anode. The cathode is where reduction happens, and the anode is where oxidation occurs. Since E° values are standard reduction potentials, the higher E° will be the cathode, and the lower (or more negative) will be the anode.

So looking at the E° values, silver has 0.80 V and aluminum is -1.66 V. Oh wait, that's the reduction potential for aluminum. Because aluminum is a metal, it's more likely to oxidize. So in the cell, the aluminum electrode will act as the anode (oxidation), and the silver as the cathode (reduction).

Wait, let me make sure. The higher E° is more likely to be reduced, right? So Ag+ will be reduced to Ag, and Al will be oxidized to Al^3+. So the two half-reactions are:

Cathode (reduction): Ag+ + e^- → Ag(s)          E° = 0.80 V
Anode (oxidation): Al → Al^3+ + 3e^-          E° = -1.66 V (but since it's oxidation, the reverse reaction, so the E for the cell is the cathode minus the anode in their reduction forms.)

Wait, no. The standard cell potential E°cell is calculated as E°cathode - E°anode. But wait, the anode is undergoing oxidation, which is the reverse of its reduction half-reaction. So the E° for the anode as written (reduction) is -1.66 V. So E°cell = 0.80 V - (-1.66 V) = 0.80 + 1.66 = 2.46 V? Or wait, no, wait.

Wait no, the anode's E° as a reduction is -1.66 V. But when it's acting as the anode, it's being oxidized, so the cell's potential is E°cathode (Ag) minus E°anode (Al as reduction). So yes, 0.80 - (-1.66) = 2.46 V.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me clarify. The overall cell reaction combines the reduction of Ag+ and the oxidation of Al. So the cell potential is the sum of the potentials, but considering the direction. So E°cell = E°cathode - E°anode (as reduction). So yes, 0.80 - (-1.66) = 2.46 V.

Now, I need to calculate the standard free energy change, ΔG°. The formula I remember is ΔG° = -nFE°, where F is Faraday's constant, n is the number of moles of electrons transferred, and E° is the cell potential in volts.

Wait, but wait. The formula is ΔG° = -n F E°, but I need to make sure the units are correct. Also, since the question asks for the answer in Kcal per mole, I'll have to convert from joules to calories.

First, let's find n, the number of moles of electrons. In the cathode reaction, Ag+ gains 1 electron. In the anode, Al loses 3 electrons (because in the given half-reaction for Al, it's Al^3+ + 3e^- → Al(s), so the reverse is Al → Al^3+ + 3e^-.

So to balance the electrons, the number of electrons from the anode and cathode must be equal. So the silver half-reaction happens 3 times to match the 3 electrons from aluminum.

So for each Al that oxidizes, it releases 3 electrons. Each Ag gains 1 electron, so 3 Ag+ would gain 3 electrons. So n, the total number of electrons transferred per mole of reaction, is 3. Because for each mole of Al, 3 moles of electrons are released.

Wait, let me write the overall reaction.

Cathode: 3 Ag+ + 3e^- → 3 Ag(s)          (multiplied by 3)
Anode: Al → Al^3+ + 3e^-                (multiplied by 1)
Overall: 3 Ag+ + Al → 3 Ag(s) + Al^3+

So the overall reaction uses 3 electrons (from the anode). So n is 3.

Now, E°cell is 2.46 V. But wait, is that correct? Let me double-check.

Wait, the standard hydrogen electrode has E° of 0 V. For the given E° values, Ag is higher than hydrogen, so it's a good oxidizing agent. Aluminum is below hydrogen, so it tends to oxidize (act as a reducing agent).

So the cell should have E°cell = E°cathode - E°anode. So 0.80 - (-1.66) = 2.46 V. That seems right.

So now, ΔG° = -n F E°.

Wait, but F is Faraday's constant, which is 96,500 coulombs per mole.

But what's n here? n is the moles of electrons per mole of reaction. In the overall reaction, each mole of Al releases 3 moles of electrons. So for each mole of Al reacted, 3 moles of electrons are transferred. So n = 3.

Putting the numbers in:

ΔG° = -n F E° = - (3 mol e^-) * (96,500 C/mol e^-) * (2.46 V)

Wait, but volts are J/C, so when you multiply F (C/mol) by volts (J/C), the C cancels, giving J/mol.

So let me compute that.

First, compute the product: 3 * 96,500 = 289,500 C/mol.

Multiply by 2.46 V: 289,500 * 2.46 = ?

Let me calculate that:

289500 * 2 = 579,000
289500 * 0.46 = let's see:

0.4 * 289500 = 115800
0.06 * 289500 = 17370
Adding those: 115800 +17370=133,170

So total is 579000 +133170 = 712,170.

So 712,170 J/mol. But wait, the negative sign: ΔG° = -712,170 J/mol.

Wait, but the question asks for Kcal per mole. Since 1 Kcal is 1000 cal, and 1 cal is 4.184 J.

So first, convert J to cal: 712,170 J * (1 cal / 4.184 J) = ?

Let me compute that:

712,170 / 4.184 ≈ Let's see, 712170 ÷ 4.184.

Well, 4.184 times 170,000 is approximately 711,  but let me compute more accurately.

Compute 712170 ÷ 4.184:

4.184 * 170,000 = 4.184 * 1.7e5 = ?

4 * 170,000 =680,000.
0.184 *170,000 = 31,280.
Total: 711,280.

That's very close to 712,170. So 170,000 cal would give 711,280 J.

The difference is 712,170 -711,280 = 890 J.

So 890 J /4.184 J/cal ≈ 212.6 cal.

So total cal is approximately 170,000 + 212.6 ≈ 170,212.6 cal, which is 170.2126 Kcal.

But wait, I had ΔG° as negative 712,170 J, which is -170,212 cal, which is -170.212 Kcal.

Wait, but wait, the formula is ΔG° = -nFE°. So n=3, F=96,500 C/mol, E°=2.46 V.

So ΔG° = -3 * 96,500 * 2.46 = -712, 170 J/mol.

Convert that to Kcal: -712170 J / (4184 J/Kcal) = ?

Wait, wait a second. Because 1 Kcal = 1000 cal, and 1 cal =4.184 J. So 1 Kcal = 4184 J.

So 712170 J / 4184 J/Kcal = ?

Compute 712170 ÷4184.

Let me approximate:

4184 * 170 = 4184 *100=418,400; 4184*70=292,880 → 418,400+292,880=711,280.

So 170 Kcal would be 711,280 J.

The difference is 712,170-711,280=890 J.

So 890 /4184 = approx 0.2128.

So total is 170.2128 Kcal.

But since ΔG° is negative, it's -170.2128 Kcal/mol.

Wait, but looking at the options, all are positive. So that's a problem.

Wait, no. Because when ΔG° is negative, the reaction is spontaneous. So the calculation gives ΔG° as negative, but all the options are positive. So I must have made a mistake in the sign somewhere.

Wait, let's recheck the formula. ΔG° = -n F E°.

Wait, so E° is 2.46 V. So ΔG° = -n F E° → negative value.

But the options are all positive. So that's confusing. What's wrong here?

Wait a minute, perhaps I got the cell potential wrong. Let me double-check the cell potential calculation.

The standard cell potential E°cell is E°cathode - E°anode.

E°cathode is for reduction (Ag+ → Ag) is 0.80 V.

E°anode is for reduction (Al^3+ → Al) is -1.66 V. But since the anode is undergoing oxidation, the reverse reaction happens, so the E for oxidation is +1.66 V.

Wait, no. The way E° is used is that E°cell is E°cathode (reduction) minus E°anode (reduction). So:

E°cell = 0.80 V - (-1.66 V) = 2.46 V, correct.

So ΔG° is negative, which makes sense because the cell is spontaneous.

But the question is asking for the standard free energy change, which should be negative as calculated. However, the options are all positive. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the anode and cathode. Wait, perhaps I should have taken the other way around. Let me think again.

The cell potential is E°cell = E°cathode - E°anode.

The cathode is Ag+ being reduced (E°=0.80), the anode is Al being oxidized (E° for its reduction is -1.66, so when it's oxidized, it's E° for the anode as written is -1.66 (because E°anode is the reduction value, and the actual reaction is oxidation), so E°cell = 0.80 - (-1.66) = 2.46.

So the calculations are correct. So ΔG° is -170 Kcal/mol, but the options are all positive. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the magnitude, but the options are given as positive values. Or perhaps I messed up the formula.

Wait, let me recheck the formula. Oh, wait! ΔG° is calculated as -nFE°, but E° here is the cell potential. So in this case, since E° is positive, ΔG° is negative.

But the options are all positive, so perhaps the question is asking for the magnitude. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the reverse cell reaction.

Wait, another approach: Maybe I should have considered the anode as the higher E°, but that doesn't make sense because E° for Al is lower.

Wait, let me think. Another possible mistake is the value of n. Let me recheck the half-reactions.

The silver reaction is Ag+ + e^- → Ag(s), E°=0.80 V.

The aluminum reaction is Al^3+ +3e^- → Al(s), E°=-1.66 V.

In the cell, Ag is reduced (cathode), Al is oxidized (anode). So the oxidation reaction is Al → Al^3+ +3e^-.

To balance the electrons, I need to multiply the silver reaction by 3 so that 3 electrons are gained.

So the overall reaction is:

3 Ag+ + Al → 3 Ag + Al^3+

So the number of moles of electrons transferred is 3 per mole of reaction.

So n=3.

So ΔG° = -n F E°.

So plugging in: n=3, F=96,500 C/mol, E=2.46 V.

ΔG° = -3 * 96,500 * 2.46 = let's compute that.

3 *96,500 =289,500.

289,500 *2.46 = ?

Let me compute 289500 *2 =579,000.

289500 *0.46: 289500 *0.4=115,800; 289500 *0.06=17,370.

Sum: 115800 +17370=133,170.

So 579,000 +133,170=712,170 J.

So 712,170 J is the value of nFE, so ΔG° = -712,170 J.

Convert that to Kcal: 712170 J ÷4184 J/Kcal ≈ 170 Kcal.

So ΔG° = -170 Kcal/mol.

But the options are all positive. So perhaps the question is asking for the magnitude, so the answer would be 170 Kcal/mol. Looking at the options, option E is +180, H is +200, etc. Wait, the closest is E: +180, but wait, my calculation is 170.2 Kcal, which is approximately 170 Kcal.

Looking at the options:

A: +170

E: +180

Wait, option A is +170 Kcal/mol. So the correct answer should be A.

Wait, but the calculated ΔG° is -170 Kcal/mol. So why is the option positive?

Ah, perhaps the question is asking for the magnitude of the free energy change, which is 170 Kcal, and since the reaction is spontaneous, ΔG is negative, but the problem might have asked for the absolute value.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of E°cell.

Wait another thought: Maybe I should have subtracted the other way. Let me think. The anode is Al, which has E°(reduction) of -1.66 V. So when calculating E°cell, it's E°cathode (Ag) - E°anode (Al as reduction), which is 0.80 - (-1.66) = 2.46 V. So that part is correct.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem considers the reverse reaction, but that doesn't make sense because the cell potential is positive, so the reaction as written is spontaneous.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the change in the opposite direction, but that would make the cell non-spontaneous, which is not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the formula and it's actually ΔG° = -nFE°, but I might have missed a negative somewhere.

Wait, let me recheck:

ΔG° (in J) = -n F E° → n=3, F=96500, E=2.46.

So 3*96500=289500.

289500 *2.46=712,170.

So ΔG°= -712,170 J/mol.

Convert to Kcal: 712170 /4184 ≈ 170.21 Kcal.

So ΔG°= -170.21 Kcal/mol.

But the options are all positive. So perhaps the question is asking for the magnitude, so the answer is 170 Kcal, which is option A.

Yes, that must be it. So the correct answer is A: +170 Kcal/mol.
</think>

To calculate the standard free energy change (ΔG°) for the given voltaic cell, we start by determining the standard cell potential (E°cell). The cell consists of a silver electrode (cathode) and an aluminum electrode (anode). The half-reactions and their standard reduction potentials are:

1. **Cathode (reduction):**  
   \[ \text{Ag}^+ + e^- \rightarrow \text{Ag(s)}, \quad E^\circ = 0.80 \, \text{V} \]

2. **Anode (oxidation):**  
   \[ \text{Al(s)} \rightarrow \text{Al}^{3+} + 3e^-, \quad E^\circ = -1.66 \, \text{V} \]

The standard cell potential is calculated as:  
\[ E^\circ_{\text{cell}} = E^\circ_{\text{cathode}} - E^\circ_{\text{anode}} \]  
Substituting the values:  
\[ E^\circ_{\text{cell}} = 0.80 \, \text{V} - (-1.66 \, \text{V}) = 2.46 \, \text{V} \]

Next, we calculate ΔG° using the formula:  
\[ \Delta G^\circ = -n F E^\circ \]  
Where:  
- \( n \) is the number of moles of electrons transferred. From the balanced reaction:  
  \[ 3 \text{Ag}^+ + \text{Al(s)} \rightarrow 3 \text{Ag(s)} + \text{Al}^{3+} \]  
  \( n = 3 \) (3 moles of electrons are transferred).  
- \( F \) is Faraday's constant (\( 96,500 \, \text{C/mol} \)).  
- \( E^\circ \) is the standard
