Okay, so I've got this question about double-bind messages, and I need to figure out which option is an example of that. Hmm, I remember that a double-bind is a concept from communication theory, right? It's when someone sends two conflicting messages, and the recipient is caught in a dilemma. The classic example I think is the "do it, but don't do it" kind of situation, where you can't really win either way.

Let me go through each option one by one. 

Option A: A brother tells his sister she can use his car but reminds her of the last accident. So he's giving permission but also pointing out a negative consequence. That's more of a warning, but I'm not sure if it's a double-bind. It's like saying you can do this, but be careful. Maybe it's just cautious permission.

Option B: Coach tells a player they can try a move but mentions it didn't work last time. Similar to A, it's offering a choice with a caution. Again, seems like advice rather than a double-bind.

Option C: Teacher says the student can do something but would appreciate if they didn't. So it's like, "You have the freedom, but I really don't want you to." That could be a double-bind because the student feels pressured to comply despite the initial permission.

Option D: Doctor says the patient can skip medication, but the pain might return. This is just stating a consequence, so it's more informative than conflicting messages.

Option E: Teacher says the student can skip homework, but grades might drop. Again, just stating a possible outcome, so it's a warning, not a double-bind.

Option F: Father says he hopes the son comes to the movies, but his tone and posture show he doesn't. Oh, this is interesting. The verbal message is positive, but the non-verbal cues are negative. So the son is getting two conflicting signals. That sounds like a double-bind because the father is sending mixed messages, making it impossible for the son to comply without some conflict.

Wait, but what defines a double-bind? It's when the person receives two contradictory messages, and they can't respond in a way that satisfies both. So in option F, the father is explicitly saying one thing but implying the opposite through non-verbal cues. That creates a conflict because the son might feel like he's being told to come, but the father's body language says he shouldn't. So it's a classic case of a double-bind.

Alternatively, option C is also a bit tricky because the teacher is giving permission but expressing a desire for the opposite. So the student feels like they have the choice, but the teacher's preference is clear. That might also be a double-bind because the student is caught between the stated permission and the implicit expectation.

Wait, so I need to decide between C and F. Let me think again. The classic example of a double-bind is when the same person gives conflicting messages, making the recipient unable to choose without displeasing the sender. In C, the teacher is giving a choice but expressing a desire, which could be seen as a double-bind because the student might feel compelled to not exercise their option. But in F, the father is explicitly saying "I hope you can come" but non-verbally indicating he doesn't want the son to. So it's conflicting messages from the same person, which is a clearer example of a double-bind.

So I think F is the correct answer because it's a direct contradiction between verbal and non-verbal messages. The son is being told to come, but the father's body language says he doesn't want him to. That creates a no-win situation, which is the essence of a double-bind.

A double-bind message occurs when conflicting messages are communicated, leaving the recipient in a dilemma where they cannot respond without causing conflict. 

- **Option A**: The brother gives permission but warns about past consequences, which is more of a cautious statement than a double-bind.
- **Option B**: The coach offers a choice with a warning, similar to A, and does not present conflicting messages.
- **Option C**: The teacher gives permission but expresses a desire for the opposite, which could create pressure but is less direct than a classic double-bind.
- **Option D**: The doctor states a consequence of skipping medication, which is informative rather than conflicting.
- **Option E**: The teacher warns about skipping homework affecting grades, again just stating a possible outcome.
- **Option F**: The father verbally expresses hope the son will come but non-verbally indicates he does not want him to. This is a clear double-bind, as the son receives contradictory messages, creating a no-win situation.

The clearest example of a double-bind is **Option F**, where verbal and non-verbal cues conflict, making it impossible for the son to comply without causing tension.
