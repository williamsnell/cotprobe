Okay, so I've got this math problem here about buying a sewing machine, and I need to figure out which one is the best buy and how much I'll save. Let me try to break this down step by step.

Alright, the problem states that there are two options. The first option is a sewing machine with a net price of $275. The second option is another machine listed at $320, but with a 12 and a half percent discount. I need to compare which one is cheaper and the savings difference between them.

Wait, 12 and a half percent... I think that's 12.5%. So the discount is 12.5% off the $320 price. Hmm, let me calculate that.

First, the first machine is straightforward—it's $275. No discount, just the net price. So I don't have to do anything with that number.

The second machine is $320 minus 12.5%. To find out the discount amount, I can calculate 12.5% of 320. I remember that 10% of a number is just moving the decimal point, and 5% is half of that. So 10% of 320 is 32. Then 2.5% would be a quarter of that 10%, which is 8. So 12.5% is 10% + 2.5%, which is 32 + 8 = 40. So the discount is $40.

Wait, wait, let me double-check that. Oh wait, no, 12.5% is actually 1/8 of the number. Because 1/8 is 0.125, which is 12.5%. So 320 divided by 8 is 40. Oh yeah, that's correct. So the discount is $40.

So the discounted price for the second machine would be 320 minus 40, which is $280. Oh, so the second machine costs $280 after the discount.

Now, comparing the two options: the first is $275, the second is $280. So the first machine is cheaper by $5. So buying the first machine would save me $5 compared to the second one.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me recalculate the discount. 12.5% of 320.

Another way to calculate 12.5% is to take the number, multiply by 0.125. So 320 * 0.125. Let's see: 320 * 0.1 is 32, 320 * 0.02 is 6.4, and 320 * 0.005 is 1.6. Adding those together: 32 + 6.4 is 38.4, plus 1.6 is 40. So yes, the discount is $40. So 320 -40 is 280.

So the first machine is $275, second is $280. So the first is cheaper by $5.

Looking at the options provided:

Option A is $275 machine, which would be the first option. Option B is the $320 machine without any discount, which would be more expensive. Option H is a $280 machine, but that's the discounted option—so the second machine becomes $280 after discount. Wait, but the question is which is the best buy. So the first machine is cheaper by $5.

So the best buy is the first machine, $275, which is option A. But wait, let me check the options again. The options are labeled from A to J, each describing a different scenario.

Wait, the question is a bit more specific. It asks which is the best buy and how much you save by buying it instead of the other. So the correct choice would be the cheaper one, which is the $275 machine, and the saving is $5.

Looking at the options, option A is the $275 machine. Option H is the $280 machine, which is the discounted one. So the best buy is option A.

But wait, let me check if any of the other options represent the $275 machine as the better deal. Let me look at the options:

Option A: $275 machine. That's the first option, correct.

Option B: $320 machine. That's the second option without discount, which is more expensive, so not the best.

Option C: $320 with 20% discount. Wait, but the problem says 12.5%, not 20%. So option C isn't relevant here.

Option D: Both same price. But they're not, so D is incorrect.

Option E: $300 machine with 10% discount.

Option F: $320 with 5% discount.

Option G: $250 with 15% discount.

Option H: $280 machine.

Option I: $310 with no discount.

Option J: $350 with 15% discount.

So the correct answer would be that the $275 machine (option A) is the best buy. So the answer is option A. But wait, the question also asks how much you save by buying it instead of the other. So the saving is $5.

Wait, but in the options, each option represents a choice of which machine to buy. The question is which machine is the best buy, so the correct option is A, because it's cheaper than the other.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are more about the possible deals, so perhaps the correct answer is that the $275 machine is better than the discounted $320 machine, which ends up at $280. So the answer is A, saving $5.

The best buy is the sewing machine priced at $275, as it is cheaper than the alternative option. The second machine, listed at $320 with a 12.5% discount, costs $280 after the discount. Comparing the two, the $275 machine saves you $5.
