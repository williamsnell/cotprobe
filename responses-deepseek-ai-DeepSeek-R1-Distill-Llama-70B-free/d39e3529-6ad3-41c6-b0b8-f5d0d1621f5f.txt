Okay, so I've got this question about why argon can be liquefied at low temperatures. Hmm, I remember that argon is a noble gas, right? Noble gases are in group 18 of the periodic table and are known for being unreactive under most conditions. But why does that matter for liquefaction?

Wait, the question is about the forces between argon atoms. I think I've heard about different types of intermolecular forces before. Like, there's ionic bonds, covalent bonds, metallic bonds, and then there's something called van der Waals forces. Oh right, van der Waals include things like dipole-dipole interactions and London dispersion forces.

Argon is monoatomic, so each atom is just by itself. Since it's a noble gas, it doesn't form covalent bonds with other argon atoms. So the bonding options like covalent (option B) or metallic (option D) probably don't apply here. Also, it doesn't have dipole-dipole forces because argon atoms are nonpolar. So dipole-dipole (option E) might not be the reason.

Wait, but then what holds the argon atoms together in a liquid or solid? Oh, right! London dispersion forces. These are temporary dipoles that occur because of electron movement. Even nonpolar molecules like argon have these instantaneous dipoles. So when the electrons move, they create a temporary dipole, and nearby atoms are attracted. These forces are usually weak, which is why noble gases have low melting and boiling points.

So the question is asking why argon can be liquefied. At low temperatures, the kinetic energy of the atoms decreases. If the atoms are moving slower, the weak London forces are enough to hold them together in a liquid state. Without those forces, the atoms would just stay as a gas because their kinetic energy would overcome any weak attractions.

Looking at the options, option C mentions instantaneous and induced dipoles, which sounds like London dispersion forces. So that's probably the right answer.

Wait, let me check the options again. Option C is the one about dipoles. So the correct answer should be C.

I don't think it's about high pressure because the question specifically mentions low temperature. So option J is about high pressure, which isn't the main factor here.

Argon can be liquefied at low temperatures due to the presence of London dispersion forces, which arise from instantaneous and induced dipoles. These weak intermolecular forces are the primary attraction between argon atoms, as argon is a noble gas and does not form ionic, covalent, or metallic bonds. At low temperatures, the kinetic energy of argon atoms decreases, allowing these weak forces to hold the atoms together in a liquid state. 

Option C correctly identifies the role of instantaneous and induced dipoles, making it the correct answer.
