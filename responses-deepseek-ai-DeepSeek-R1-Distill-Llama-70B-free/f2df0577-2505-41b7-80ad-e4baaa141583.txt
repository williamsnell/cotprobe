Okay, so I have this genetics question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about patterns of inheritance and specifically asks which pattern has male-to-male transmission as a key feature. Hmm, I remember that different inheritance patterns have distinct characteristics based on how the genes are passed down.

Let me think about each option one by one. 

Option A: Autosomal incomplete dominance. Autosomal means the gene is on a non-sex chromosome. Incomplete dominance is when the heterozygote shows a blend of the two traits, like pink flowers from red and white parents. But does this involve male-to-male transmission? Well, autosomal traits can be passed from either parent to offspring regardless of gender, but male-to-male isn't unique or a key feature here. So probably not the answer.

Option B: X-linked dominant. X-linked means the gene is on the X chromosome. Dominant means only one copy is needed. Since males get their X from their mother, if a father has an X-linked dominant trait, can he pass it to his son? Wait, no. Because the father gives his Y chromosome to sons, not the X. So sons can't get X-linked traits from their dads. So male-to-male transmission isn't a thing here. So B is unlikely.

Option C: Multifactorial inheritance. This involves multiple genes and environmental factors, like height or heart disease. It's more about the traits influenced by several factors, not really about the pattern of transmission between genders. So probably not the answer.

Option D: Mitochondrial inheritance. Mitochondria have their own DNA, and they're passed down maternally. So you get your mitochondria from your mother, not your father. So male-to-male transmission isn't a factor here. D is out.

Option E: X-linked underdominance. Underdominance is when the heterozygote is less fit than either homozygote. But again, X-linked traits can't be passed from father to son, so E isn't the right choice.

Option F: X-linked recessive. In this case, males are more affected because they have only one X. So if a father has an X-linked recessive condition, he can't pass it to his sons because he gives them the Y. So F doesn't allow male-to-male transmission either.

Option G: Y-linked inheritance. Oh wait, the Y chromosome is passed from father to son. So if a trait is on the Y, fathers can pass it to their sons. That would mean male-to-male transmission is a key feature here. That seems to fit the question. So G is a strong candidate.

Option H: Autosomal recessive. Autosomal means either parent can pass it to either child. But again, it's not specifically about male-to-male, just that two copies are needed. So H isn't specific enough.

Option I: Autosomal dominant. Similarly, this is about one copy being enough, not gender-specific transmission. So I doesn't fit.

Option J: X-linked overdominance. Overdominance is when the heterozygote has an advantage. But again, X-linked traits can't be passed from father to son, so J isn't the answer.

Putting it all together, the key here is that male-to-male transmission happens when the gene is on the Y chromosome because fathers pass the Y to their sons. So the correct answer is G: Y-linked inheritance.
</think>

Male-to-male transmission is a key feature of Y-linked inheritance because the Y chromosome is passed exclusively from father to son. This pattern of inheritance is unique to traits located on the Y chromosome, as fathers cannot pass the X chromosome to their male offspring. Other inheritance patterns, such as autosomal or X-linked, do not allow for male-to-male transmission in the same way. Therefore, the correct answer is:

G: Y-linked inheritance

Answer: G
