Okay, so I've got this problem about X-ray diffraction, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that there are two components of X-ray radiation with wavelengths 154.433 pm and 154.051 pm. They're asking for the difference in glancing angles (2θ) between the two diffraction lines. The planes have a separation of 77.8 pm.

Hmm, I remember that X-ray diffraction uses Bragg's Law. Bragg's Law is nλ = 2d sinθ, right? Where n is the order, λ is the wavelength, d is the interplanar spacing, and θ is the angle. But wait, the question is about the difference in 2θ, so I need to find θ for each wavelength and then subtract, then double the difference maybe? Or wait, no, 2θ is the angle in the diffraction pattern. So each wavelength will have its own 2θ, and I need the difference between those two 2θ angles.

Wait, but let's think about how to approach this. Since the two wavelengths are very close to each other, the difference in θ might be small, so maybe I can use some approximation. Let me outline the steps.

1. Use Bragg's Law for each wavelength to find their respective θ angles.
2. Subtract the two θ values to get the difference.
3. Multiply by 2 to get the difference in 2θ.

But wait, maybe there's a smarter way without calculating each angle individually. Let me think.

Let me denote the two wavelengths as λ1 = 154.433 pm and λ2 = 154.051 pm. The d-spacing is given as 77.8 pm. Let's assume n=1 for simplicity, since the problem doesn't specify the order.

So for each wavelength, Bragg's Law is λ = 2d sinθ. Wait, no, correction: nλ = 2d sinθ, so if n=1, then λ = 2d sinθ.

Wait, let me write this correctly. For each case:

λ₁ = 2d sinθ₁

λ₂ = 2d sinθ₂

So sinθ₁ = λ₁/(2d)

Similarly, sinθ₂ = λ₂/(2d)

Let me compute sinθ₁ and sinθ₂.

Compute d=77.8 pm.

So 2d = 155.6 pm.

λ₁ = 154.433 pm → sinθ₁ = 154.433 / 155.6 ≈ Let me calculate this.

154.433 / 155.6 → Let me compute that. 155.6 is about 155.6, so 154.433 is just slightly less than that.

Let me compute 154.433 / 155.6 = Let's see, 154.433 / 155.6 = approximately 0.9921 (since 155.6 * 0.99 is 153.9, and 0.9921 would give a bit more).

Similarly, λ₂=154.051 pm → sinθ₂ = 154.051 / 155.6 ≈ (I'll compute this too.)

154.051 / 155.6 → Let's compute:

155.6 * 0.99 is 153.9, so 154.051 is 154.051-153.9=0.151 above that, so 0.99 + (0.151/155.6) ≈ 0.99 + 0.00097 ≈ 0.99097.

Wait, let me compute this more accurately.

Wait, 154.433 / 155.6 = let's compute it as:

155.6 * x = 154.433 → x = 154.433 / 155.6.

Calculate numerator and denominator in same units. Let me write it as 154433 fm / 155600 fm = 154433/155600. Hmm, maybe I can compute this division.

Let me compute 154433 ÷ 155600.

Well, 155600 is 1556 * 100, and 154433 is 1544.33 * 100. So compute 1544.33 / 1556.

Let me do this division:

1556 ) 1544.33 (0. something.

1556 goes into 1544.33 0 times. So 0.

Wait, maybe I can write it as 1.54433e5 / 1.556e5 = approx 0.9921.

Similarly, 154.051 / 155.6: 154051 / 155600.

Same approach: 154051 ÷ 155600 → Let me compute 154051 ÷155600.

We can write it as (155600 - 1549) / 155600 = 1 - (1549 / 155600).

Wait, wait, 155600 - 1549 = 154051.

So 154051 / 155600 = 1 - 1549/155600.

Compute 1549 ÷ 155600 → approximately 0.00995.

So 1 - 0.00995 = 0.99005.

So, sinθ₁ ≈ 0.9921, sinθ₂ ≈ 0.99005.

Wait, but wait: wait, 2d is 155.6 pm, and λ₁ is 154.433 pm, which is less than 155.6, so sinθ1 would be less than 1, which is correct.

Now, I can find θ₁ and θ₂ using the inverse sine function.

But perhaps instead of calculating each θ and then subtracting, I can find the difference in sinθ and relate that to the difference in θ, then multiply by 2.

Alternatively, maybe use a small angle approximation. But let's see.

The difference in λ is small (about 0.382 pm), so the difference in θ might be small. So perhaps we can approximate the change in sinθ as the change in λ, but let me think.

Wait, since λ = 2d sinθ → sinθ = λ/(2d).

So, the difference in λ is Δλ = λ₁ - λ₂ = 154.433 - 154.051 = 0.382 pm.

But wait, since λ₁ > λ₂, then sinθ₁ would be greater than sinθ₂, so θ₁ > θ₂, so the difference in θ is θ₁ - θ₂.

But wait, let's think about the relation between the change in λ and the change in sinθ.

Δλ = 0.382 pm.

So, sinθ₁ - sinθ₂ = (λ₁ - λ₂)/(2d) = 0.382 / (155.6) ≈ 0.382 / 155.6 ≈ 0.002454.

So, sinθ₁ - sinθ₂ ≈ 0.002454.

Now, I can approximate the difference in θ using the derivative. Because for small changes, Δ(sinθ) ≈ cosθ * Δθ.

So, Δ(sinθ) ≈ cosθ * Δθ → Δθ ≈ Δ(sinθ) / cosθ.

But I can approximate cosθ as cosθ_avg, but perhaps I can take the average of the two angles.

Wait, but let's compute θ for one of the wavelengths first. Let's pick λ₂=154.051 pm.

sinθ₂ = 154.051 / 155.6 ≈ 0.99005.

So θ₂ ≈ sin⁻¹(0.99005). Let me compute that.

I know that sin(81 degrees) is about 0.9877, sin(82) is about 0.9903. So 0.99005 is between 81 and 82 degrees.

Wait, let me calculate more accurately. Let's recall that sin(81) ≈ 0.9877, sin(81.5) is about what? Let me think: using a calculator here would be best, but since I can't, I'll estimate.

Wait, the value is 0.99005. Let's see:

sin(81) = 0.9877

sin(82) = 0.9903

So, 0.99005 is just a bit less than 82 degrees. Let's say approximately 81.98 degrees.

Wait, wait, 82 degrees is 0.9903, so 0.99005 is 0.9903 - 0.00025. Hmm, maybe 81.97 degrees.

But perhaps it's better to compute using a small angle approximation. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the angles more accurately, but I'm not sure without a calculator.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximation for small differences. Since the change in sinθ is small (0.00245), and the angles are close, maybe I can approximate the difference in θ as Δθ ≈ (Δ(sinθ)) / cosθ.

But to compute this, I need cosθ. Let's take θ as approximately the average of θ₁ and θ₂. Alternatively, compute cosθ for one of them.

Let me compute θ₂ first.

sinθ₂ ≈ 0.99005 → θ₂ ≈ sin⁻¹(0.99005) ≈ 81.97 degrees. Let me take θ₂ ≈ 82 degrees.

Similarly, sinθ₁ is 0.9921, which would be a bit higher. So θ₁ is about sin⁻¹(0.9921) → that's close to 83 degrees, because sin(83) is about 0.9925. So perhaps θ₁ is about 82.8 degrees.

Wait, let me check: sin(82) is 0.9903, sin(83)=0.9925. So sinθ₁=0.9921 is between 82 and 83 degrees. Let's compute the exact value.

So, 0.9921 - 0.9903 = 0.0018, and between 82 and 83, the difference in sin is 0.9925 - 0.9903=0.0022. So 0.0018/0.0022 ≈ 0.818 of the way from 82 to 83. So θ₁ ≈ 82 + 0.818 ≈ 82.818 degrees.

Similarly, θ₂ was about 81.97 degrees.

So the difference in θ is θ₁ - θ₂ ≈ 82.818 - 81.97 ≈ 0.848 degrees.

Wait, but wait, that's the difference in θ, so the difference in 2θ would be about 1.696 degrees, approximately 1.7 degrees.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.75°, which is close. Alternatively, I might have made an approximation error.

Wait, but perhaps I should approach this more accurately, using calculus. Let me try that approach.

Given that λ = 2d sinθ → θ = sin⁻¹(λ/(2d)).

We can write the difference in θ as Δθ = θ₁ - θ₂.

Using the approximation for small Δλ, the change in θ can be approximated by the derivative.

dθ/dλ = (1/(2d)) * (1 / sqrt(1 - (λ/(2d))²)).

So, Δθ ≈ (dθ/dλ) * Δλ.

Compute this:

dθ/dλ = 1/(2d * sqrt(1 - (λ/(2d))²)).

We can compute this at some λ, perhaps the average of the two wavelengths. Let's compute at λ = average of 154.433 and 154.051, which is (154.433 + 154.051)/2 = 154.242 pm.

Compute λ/(2d) = 154.242 / 155.6 ≈ 0.9906.

So, sqrt(1 - (0.9906)^2) = sqrt(1 - 0.9812) = sqrt(0.0188) ≈ 0.137.

So, dθ/dλ = 1/(2*77.8 pm * 0.137) → Wait, but the units are in pm, which is 1e-12 m, but since we're working with ratios, the units would cancel out.

Wait, 2d is 155.6 pm, so 2d = 155.6 pm.

So, 2d = 155.6 pm.

So, dθ/dλ = (1/(2d)) * 1/sqrt(1 - (λ/(2d))^2).

Wait, 2d is 155.6 pm, so 1/(2d) is 1/155.6 ≈ 0.00643 per pm.

Wait, no, let's compute it correctly.

Wait, dθ/dλ = [1/(2d)] / sqrt(1 - (λ/(2d))^2).

So, substituting:

[1/(155.6 pm)] / sqrt(1 - (0.9906)^2) → [1/155.6] / 0.137.

Wait, 1/155.6 is approximately 0.006426 pm^-1.

So, 0.006426 / 0.137 ≈ 0.04687 radians per pm.

Wait, but the derivative is dθ/dλ in radians per pm.

So, Δθ ≈ dθ/dλ * Δλ.

Δλ is 0.382 pm.

So, Δθ ≈ 0.04687 rad/pm * 0.382 pm ≈ 0.0179 radians.

Convert radians to degrees: 0.0179 * (180/pi) ≈ 0.0179 * 57.2958 ≈ 1.026 degrees.

So, the difference in θ is approximately 1.026 degrees, so the difference in 2θ is about 2.05 degrees.

Looking at the options, option E is 2.14°, which is close. Hmm, but wait, let me check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the derivative approach. Let me go through it again.

dθ/dλ = [1/(2d)] / sqrt(1 - (λ/(2d))^2).

So, 2d = 155.6 pm.

So, 1/(2d) = 1/155.6 ≈ 0.006426 pm^-1.

sqrt(1 - (λ/(2d))^2) when λ is 154.242 pm (average), λ/(2d)=0.9906.

So, 1 - (0.9906)^2 = 1 - 0.98124 = 0.01876.

sqrt(0.01876) ≈ 0.1369.

So, dθ/dλ = (0.006426) / 0.1369 ≈ 0.0469 rad/pm.

Δλ is 0.382 pm.

So, Δθ = 0.0469 * 0.382 ≈ 0.0179 radians.

Convert to degrees: 0.0179 * (180/π) ≈ 1.026 degrees.

So, 2θ difference is 2.052 degrees, approximately 2.05 degrees.

Looking at the options, the closest is E: 2.14°, but that's a bit higher. Alternatively, perhaps my approximation using the average λ isn't perfect.

Alternatively, let me compute the θ for each wavelength using the inverse sine function more accurately.

Compute θ₁ = sin⁻¹(154.433 / 155.6) → sinθ₁ = 0.99213.

What's the angle with sinθ = 0.99213?

I know that sin(83°) ≈ 0.99255.

So, 0.99213 is a bit less than 83°, so perhaps 82.8 degrees.

Let me compute the exact value using a small angle approximation around 83 degrees.

Let me let θ = 83° - δ, where δ is small in degrees.

sin(83° - δ) = sin83 cosδ - cos83 sinδ.

Approximating for small δ (in radians), cosδ ≈ 1, sinδ ≈ δ in radians.

So, sin(83 - δ) ≈ sin83 - cos83 * δ.

We have sin(83 - δ) = 0.99213.

sin83 ≈ 0.99255.

So, 0.99255 - cos83 * δ ≈ 0.99213.

cos83 ≈ 0.12187.

So, 0.99255 - 0.12187 * δ = 0.99213.

Subtract 0.99255 from both sides: -0.12187 δ ≈ -0.00042.

Multiply both sides by -1: 0.12187 δ ≈ 0.00042.

So, δ ≈ 0.00042 / 0.12187 ≈ 0.003447 radians.

Wait, but δ is in radians? Wait, no, because when I approximated sinδ ≈ δ (in radians), but in the equation, δ is in degrees, so perhaps I should convert δ to radians when using the approximation.

Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated without a calculator. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the difference more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute θ₁ and θ₂ using a calculator, but since I can't, I'll proceed with the approximation.

Similarly, for θ₂: sinθ₂ = 154.051 / 155.6 ≈ 0.99005.

Which angle has a sine of approximately 0.99005?

I know that sin(82°) ≈ 0.99028.

So, 0.99005 is slightly less than that. Let's compute δ again.

Let θ₂ = 82° - δ.

sin(82 - δ) ≈ sin82 - cos82 * δ.

sin82 ≈ 0.99028.

Set this equal to 0.99005:

0.99028 - cos82 * δ ≈ 0.99005.

cos82 ≈ 0.13917.

So, 0.99028 - 0.13917 * δ ≈ 0.99005.

Subtract 0.99028: -0.13917 δ ≈ -0.00023.

Multiply both sides by -1: 0.13917 δ ≈ 0.00023.

δ ≈ 0.00023 / 0.13917 ≈ 0.001653 radians.

Convert radians to degrees: 0.001653 * (180/π) ≈ 0.0946 degrees.

So, θ₂ ≈ 82° - 0.0946° ≈ 81.9054 degrees.

Similarly, for θ₁, I found θ₁ ≈ 82.8 degrees.

Wait, let me double-check that. Earlier, I had θ₁ as 82.818 degrees, but let me recompute.

Wait, for θ₁: sinθ₁ = 0.99213. The closest known sine is sin(83°)=0.99255.

The difference is 0.99255 - 0.99213 = 0.000
