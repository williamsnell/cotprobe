Question:

Terri opened a fast food restaurant. The initial cost to open the restaurant is $800,000. She has to pay daily operational costs of $250 and labor costs of $400. What expression represents her total cost if she has had the restaurant open for “ D ” days?

Options:

A: 800,000 + 400 D
B: 250 + 800,000 D
C: 400 + 800,000 D
D: 800,000 − 650 D
E: 800,000 + 650 D
F: 800,000 + 150 D
G: 800,000 + 1050 D
H: 800,000 − 150 D
I: 650 + 800,000 D
J: 800,000 + 250 D

Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Terri opened a fast food restaurant and there are some costs involved. The question is asking for an expression that represents her total cost after D days of operation.

First, let me read the problem again carefully. The initial cost to open the restaurant is $800,000. So that's a one-time cost, right? She doesn't have to pay that every day. Then there are daily operational costs of $250 and labor costs of $400. Oh wait, so these are daily recurring expenses.

So, the total cost will have two parts: the initial fixed cost and the variable costs that depend on the number of days the restaurant has been open.

Let me break it down. The fixed cost is straightforward—it's $800,000, and this doesn't change no matter how many days she operates. Now, for each day she's open, she has to pay $250 in operational costs and $400 in labor. So each day, the variable cost is the sum of these two.

Calculating the daily variable cost: $250 (operational) + $400 (labor) equals $650 per day. So for each day D, the variable cost is 650*D dollars.

Now, putting it all together, the total cost after D days would be the initial cost plus the daily variable cost multiplied by the number of days. So the expression should be 800,000 + 650*D.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one matches this expression. Let me scan through them.

Option A: 800,000 + 400D. Hmm, that's only the labor cost, missing the operational part. So no.

Option B: 250 + 800,000D. Wait, that's adding a small fixed cost and a huge daily cost, which doesn't fit because the initial cost is a fixed $800k, not per day.

Option C: 400 + 800,000D. Similar issue as B, but with different numbers. Not right.

Option D: 800,000 − 650D. Oh, subtraction? That doesn't make sense. Costs should add up, not subtract. So no.

Option E: 800,000 + 650D. Yes, that matches what I calculated earlier. Initial cost plus daily variable cost times days.

Option F: 800,000 + 150D. That's much lower than the daily cost we found. So not correct.

Option G: 800,000 + 1050D. That's higher than our calculated 650 per day. Doesn't fit.

Option H: 800,000 − 150D. Again, subtraction, which is incorrect.

Option I: 650 + 800,000D. That flips the fixed and variable costs, which is wrong.

Option J: 800,000 + 250D. Only accounts for operational, missing labor. So no.

So the correct answer should be option E.

The total cost for Terri's restaurant includes a fixed initial cost of $800,000 and daily variable costs of $250 (operational) + $400 (labor) = $650 per day. Therefore, the expression for the total cost after D days is:

**800,000 + 650D**

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

E: 800,000 + 650 D

Answer: E
