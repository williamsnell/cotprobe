Answer:
    <think>


To evaluate the expression \(-2(x - 3)\) for \(x = 2\), follow these steps:

1. **Substitute \(x = 2\) into the expression**:
   \[
   -2(2 - 3)
   \]

2. **Simplify inside the parentheses**:
   \[
   2 - 3 = -1
   \]
   So the expression becomes:
   \[
   -2(-1)
   \]

3. **Multiply \(-2\) by \(-1\)**:
   \[
   -2 \times -1 = 2
   \]

Thus, the value of \(-2(x - 3)\) when \(x = 2\) is \(2\).

The correct answer is **F**.
