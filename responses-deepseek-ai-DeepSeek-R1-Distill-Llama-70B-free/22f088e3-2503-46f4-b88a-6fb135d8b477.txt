Okay, so I have this problem about electroplating copper, and I'm supposed to find out how many coulombs are needed to plate out 50 grams of copper. Hmm, I remember that electroplating involves electrochemistry, so I think I need to use Faraday's laws here.

Wait, Faraday's first law says that the amount of substance deposited is proportional to the amount of charge passed through the solution. Right, and the formula I think is something like m = (Q * M) / (n * F), where m is mass, Q is charge in coulombs, M is molar mass, n is the number of electrons transferred, and F is Faraday's constant.

So the problem gives me 50 grams of copper. The molar mass of copper is about 63.55 g/mol. Copper in the solution is Cu^2+, so each ion has a +2 charge. That means each copper ion gains 2 electrons to become metallic copper. So n is 2.

Faraday's constant is approximately 96485 C/mol. Let me make sure I remember that right—yes, around 96,485 coulombs per mole of electrons.

I need to solve for Q. So rearranging the formula, Q = (m * n * F) / M.

Plugging in the numbers: m is 50 grams. Oh wait, that's 0.05 moles because 50g / 63.55g/mol ≈ 0.787 mol? Wait, wait. Let me calculate that properly. 50 divided by 63.55 is approximately 0.787, right? No, wait, 50 divided by 63.55 is actually about 0.787, yeah.

Wait, no, wait a second. Let me compute it accurately. 63.55 times 0.787 is about 50? Let me check 63.55 * 0.787. 63 * 0.7 is 44.1, 63 * 0.08 is 5.04, 63*.007 is 0.441. So 44.1 +5.04=49.14, +0.441 is 49.581. Hmm, but wait, 50g is the mass. Oh wait, no, wait: I think I messed that up. Wait, 63.55 grams is a mole, so 50 grams is 50 / 63.55 = approx 0.7873 moles of Cu.

So m is 0.7873 moles. n is 2, because each Cu^2+ needs 2 electrons. F is 96485 C/mol.

So Q = (0.7873 mol) * 2 * 96485 C/mol.

Calculating that: 0.7873 times 2 is about 1.5746. Multiply that by 96485. Let's see, 1.5746 * 96485.

Wait, 1.5 times 96485 is about 144,727.5. Then 0.0746 times 96485. Let me compute that: 0.07 *96,485 is 6,753.95, and 0.0046*96,485 is approximate 443.33. So total is 6,753.95 +443.33=7,197.28. So total Q is 144,727.5 +7,197.28= about 151,924.78 coulombs.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check the choices. The options are:

A:1.25e5 (125,000)
B:1.45e5
C:1.67e5
D:1.8e5
E:1.4e5
F:1.75e5
G:1.3e5
H:1.6e5
I:1.52e5
J:1.5e5.

Wait, 151,924 is about 1.519e5, which is approximately 1.52e5, which is option I.

Wait but wait, did I make any calculation mistakes? Let me double-check the steps.

Wait, m is 50g of Cu. Molar mass is 63.55 g/mol. So moles = 50 /63.55 = approx 0.7873. Correct.

Each mole of Cu requires 2 moles of electrons (since Cu^2+ → Cu, two electrons). So total charge is moles * n * F.

So 0.7873 * 2 * 96485 = ?

Calculating 0.7873 * 2 = 1.5746.

1.5746 * 96485.

Well, 1 * 96485 = 96485.

0.5*96485=48242.5 → 96485 +48242.5 = 144727.5.

0.0746 *96485 = ?

Wait, 0.07 is 6753.95, 0.0046 is 443.33. So 6753.95 +443.33=7,197.28.

So total is 144727.5 +7,197.28=151,924.78 C, which is 1.519e5.

Looking at the options, option I is 1.52e5. So that seems correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Wait, exact calculation:

50g / 63.55 g/mol = 0.7873 mol.

Q = 0.7873 * 2 * 96485 = ?

Let me compute 0.7873 * 2 = 1.5746.

1.5746 * 96485 = ?

Let me compute 96485 * 1.5746.

Break it down:

96485 * 1 =96485
96485 * 0.5=48242.5
96485 * 0.07 = 6753.95
96485 *0.004=385.94
96485 *0.0006=57.891

Wait, that might not be the best way. Alternatively, think of 1.5746 as 1 + 0.5 + 0.07 + 0.004 + 0.0006.

Wait, perhaps an easier way is to compute 96485 * 1.5746.

But perhaps I can compute 96485 * 1.5746 = ?

Well, 96485 * 1.5746.

Let me compute 96485 * 1.5 = 144,727.5.

Then, 96485 * 0.0746.

Wait, 0.07 *96485= 6,753.95.

0.0046 *96485 = let's compute 0.004 *96485 = 385.94, and 0.0006 *96485 is 57.891.

So 385.94 +57.891=443.831.

So 6,753.95 +443.831=7,197.781.

So total is 144,727.5 +7,197.781=151,925.281 coulombs.

So approximately 1.5195e5, which is 151,950 C. So closest to option I:1.52e5.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of moles. Let me recheck that.

Molar mass of copper is indeed 63.55 g/mol. So 50g /63.55 g/mol = 0.7873 mol.

Yes. So that part is correct.

So the answer should be I:1.52e5 coulombs.
</think>

To determine the number of coulombs required to plate out 50 g of copper from an aqueous solution of CuSO₄, we use Faraday's laws of electrolysis. The relevant formula is:

\[
Q = \frac{m \cdot n \cdot F}{M}
\]

Where:
- \( m = 50 \, \text{g} \) (mass of copper to be deposited),
- \( M = 63.55 \, \text{g/mol} \) (molar mass of copper),
- \( n = 2 \) (number of electrons transferred, as Cu²⁺ gains 2 electrons to form Cu),
- \( F = 96485 \, \text{C/mol} \) (Faraday's constant).

### Step 1: Calculate the number of moles of copper
\[
\text{Moles of copper} = \frac{m}{M} = \frac{50}{63.55} \approx 0.7873 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total charge required
\[
Q = 0.7873 \cdot 2 \cdot 96485.
\]

First, calculate \( 0.7873 \cdot 2 \):
\[
0.7873 \cdot 2 = 1.5746.
\]

Then, multiply by \( 96485 \):
\[
1.5746 \cdot 96485 \approx 151,925.28 \, \text{C}.
\]

### Step 3: Match the result to the closest option
The calculated value of \( Q \) is approximately \( 1.52 \times 10^5 \, \text{C} \), which corresponds to option **I**.
