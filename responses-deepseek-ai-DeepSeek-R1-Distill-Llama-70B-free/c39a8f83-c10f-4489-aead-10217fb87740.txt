Okay, so I've got this chemistry question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the conjugate acid of the H2PO4- ion. Hmm, I remember that acids and bases are related through their ability to donate or accept protons, right? So the conjugate acid would be the species formed when the base gains a proton.

Wait, wait, no, actually, the conjugate acid is formed when an acid donates a proton. So if H2PO4- is acting as a base, its conjugate acid would be the result after it accepts a proton. Or wait, I think I got that mixed up. Let me think again.

In the context of Bronsted-Lowry theory, an acid donates a proton (H+), and a base accepts a proton. So the conjugate acid of a base is the species formed when that base gains a proton. So H2PO4- is the base here, and its conjugate acid would be H2PO4- plus an H+.

So adding a proton to H2PO4- would give me H3PO4. Because H2PO4- has a negative charge, so adding a proton would make it neutral. Let me write that down: H2PO4- + H+ → H3PO4.

Now, looking at the options provided, I need to see which one is H3PO4. Let me go through the options:

Option A: PO4^3- → That's the phosphate ion, which is more deprotonated than H2PO4-.

Option B: H3PO4^2- → That's a dihydrogen phosphate with a 2- charge, which seems different.

Option C: H3PO4^3- → Hmm, that's a triply charged ion. Not sure about that.

Option D: H4PO4- → Wait, that would be if H2PO4- gained two protons, but that's not the case here. We're only adding one.

Option E: H2PO4^- → That's the same as the original, so no.

Option F: H2PO4^3- → That doesn't make sense because adding a proton would reduce the charge by one, not increase it.

Option G: HPO4^2- → That's a hydrogen phosphate ion, which is more deprotonated than H2PO4-.

Option H: H4PO4+ → That's a positive charge, which seems off because adding a proton to a negative ion would make it neutral, not positive.

Option I: H3PO4 → Oh, that's neutral, which matches what I was thinking. So this is the conjugate acid.

Option J: H2PO4^2- → That's a different ion, more charged.

So the correct answer should be option I: H3PO4.

The conjugate acid of a base is formed when the base accepts a proton (H⁺). The given species is H₂PO₄⁻, which acts as a base. Adding one proton to H₂PO₄⁻ results in H₃PO₄, which is a neutral molecule. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A (PO₄³⁻):** This is the fully deprotonated phosphate ion, not the conjugate acid.
- **B (H₃PO₄²⁻):** This has an additional charge and is not the conjugate acid.
- **C (H₃PO₄³⁻):** Incorrect, as it has an extra charge.
- **D (H₄PO₄⁻):** This would require adding two protons, which is not the case here.
- **E (H₂PO₄⁻):** This is the original species, not its conjugate acid.
- **F (H₂PO₄³⁻):** Incorrect, as the charge increases instead of decreasing.
- **G (HPO₄²⁻):** This is a more deprotonated form, not the conjugate acid.
- **H (H₄PO₄⁺):** This has a positive charge, which is inconsistent with adding a proton to a negatively charged species.
- **I (H₃PO₄):** This is the correct answer, as it is the neutral species formed by adding one proton to H₂PO₄⁻.
- **J (H₂PO₄²⁻):** Incorrect, as it has a different charge.

The correct answer is **I: H₃PO₄**.
