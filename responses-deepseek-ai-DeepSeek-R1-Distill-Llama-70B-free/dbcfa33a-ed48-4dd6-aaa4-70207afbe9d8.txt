Okay, so I've got this probability problem here. Let me try to understand what it's asking. The question says that a point in space (x, y, z) is randomly selected within the ranges -1 ≤ x ≤ 1, -1 ≤ y ≤ 1, and -1 ≤ z ≤ 1. I need to find the probability that x² + y² + z² ≤ 1.

Hmm, so I remember that in probability, when dealing with uniform distributions in space, the probability is usually the volume of the region where the condition is satisfied divided by the total volume of the space where the point can be selected.

Right, so the region where the point is selected is a cube. Each side of the cube goes from -1 to 1, so each edge is 2 units long. The volume of a cube is edge length cubed. So the edge length is 2, so the volume is 2^3 = 8. That's the denominator of my probability.

Now, the numerator is the volume where x² + y² + z² ≤ 1. Wait, that's the equation of a sphere with radius 1 centered at the origin. So I'm looking for the volume of a sphere with radius 1.

The volume of a sphere is given by (4/3)πr³. Since r is 1 here, the volume is (4/3)π * 1³ = 4π/3.

Wait, but wait a second. The cube is from -1 to 1 in all axes, so the sphere of radius 1 is entirely contained within the cube, right? Because the cube has sides from -1 to 1, which is exactly the sphere's radius. So the entire sphere is inside the cube, so the volume of the sphere is all that matters for the condition x² + y² + z² ≤ 1.

So the probability should be the sphere's volume divided by the cube's volume. That would be (4π/3) divided by 8. Let's compute that.

4π/3 divided by 8 is the same as (4π/3) * (1/8) = (4π)/(24) = π/6. Oh wait, π/6 is one of the answer choices. Let me check the options again.

Looking back, option I is π/6. So that's probably the correct answer.

Wait, but did I miss anything? Let me think again. The cube has a volume of 8, correct. The sphere is entirely inside the cube since the sphere's radius is 1 and the cube extends from -1 to 1 in each axis. So the sphere's volume is 4π/3, so the probability is (4π/3) / 8 = π/6. Yep, that makes sense.

So the answer should be I: π/6.

The problem involves finding the probability that a randomly selected point \((x, y, z)\) within the cube defined by \(-1 \le x \le 1\), \(-1 \le y \le 1\), and \(-1 \le z \le 1\) satisfies the condition \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \le 1\). 

1. **Volume of the Cube**:  
   The cube has edge lengths of 2 units (from \(-1\) to \(1\) in each dimension). The volume of the cube is:  
   \[
   \text{Volume of the cube} = 2^3 = 8.
   \]

2. **Volume of the Sphere**:  
   The condition \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \le 1\) describes a sphere of radius 1 centered at the origin. The volume of a sphere is given by:  
   \[
   \text{Volume of the sphere} = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3.
   \]  
   Substituting \(r = 1\):  
   \[
   \text{Volume of the sphere} = \frac{4}{3}\pi.
   \]

3. **Probability Calculation**:  
   The probability is the ratio of the volume of the sphere to the volume of the cube:  
   \[
   \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Volume of the sphere}}{\text{Volume of the cube}} = \frac{\frac{4}{3}\pi}{8} = \frac{\pi}{6}.
   \]

4. **Answer Selection**:  
   Among the given options, \(\frac{\pi}{6}\) corresponds to option **I**.

Thus, the final answer is:

**I**
