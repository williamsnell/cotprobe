Okay, so I've got this math problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because it's a bit tricky. Let me read it carefully again.

The question is asking to find all positive integers n less than 2^250 that satisfy three conditions simultaneously:

1. n divides 2^n (so n | 2^n)
2. n-1 divides 2^n -1 (so (n-1) | (2^n -1))
3. n-2 divides 2^n -2 (so (n-2) | (2^n -2))

And I have to return all such positive integers as an ascending list. The options given are from A to J, each with a list of three numbers. My job is to figure out which option is correct.

Hmm, okay. Let's break this down. I'm going to tackle each condition one by one and see what they imply about n.

First condition: n divides 2^n. So 2^n ≡ 0 mod n. That suggests that n must be a power of 2. Because if n has any odd prime factors, then 2^n mod n wouldn't be zero. Wait, no, that's not necessarily true. Wait, if n is a composite number, it's possible. Wait, what's the condition for n dividing 2^n?

I remember that for n to divide 2^n, n must be a power of 2. Because if n is a power of 2, say n=2^k, then 2^n = 2^(2^k), which is obviously divisible by 2^k. But if n has any other prime factors, then 2^n mod n won't be zero. So the first condition tells us that n must be a power of 2. So n=2^k for some integer k.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Suppose n is 1. Does 1 divide 2^1? Yes, because 1 divides everything. So n can be 1 as well.

So possible n's are n=1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc., up to 2^250.

Now the second condition: (n-1) divides 2^n - 1. So (n-1) | (2^n -1). Let's denote m = n-1. So m divides 2^{m+1} -1.

Wait, m divides 2^{m+1} -1. That rings a bell. I remember that for m being a Mersenne prime, 2^m -1 is prime, and in that case, 2^m ≡ 1 mod (2^m -1). But here, the exponent is m+1, so perhaps m is a Mersenne prime exponent?

Alternatively, maybe m is a number such that 2^{m+1} ≡ 1 mod m. Wait, that sounds like Fermat's little theorem. But Fermat's theorem applies when m is prime, so 2^{m} ≡ 2 mod m. But here, we have 2^{m+1} ≡ 1 mod m. Hmm, perhaps m is a pseudoprime or something.

Wait, let's think of m where 2^{m+1} ≡ 1 mod m. Let me try small m's.

Let's try m=1: 2^{2}=4. 4 mod 1 is 0, but 1 divides 0, so yes. So m=1 is acceptable. So n-1=1 → n=2. So n=2 is a candidate.

m=2: 2^3=8. 8 mod 2 is 0. So 2 divides 8-1=7? Wait, wait. Wait, the condition is m divides 2^{m+1} -1. Wait, m=2: 2^3 -1=7. Does 2 divide 7? No, because 7/2 is 3.5. So m=2 doesn't satisfy the condition. So n-1=2 → n=3 is not in our list because n must be a power of 2, but 3 isn't a power of 2. So that's not a problem.

Wait, we only have n as power of 2, so n-1 would be one less than a power of 2. So for n=2^k, m=2^k -1.

So for m=2^k -1, we have that m divides 2^{2^k} -1.

Hmm, perhaps m is a Mersenne prime. Because Mersenne primes are primes of the form 2^p -1 for some prime p. But wait, in our case, m=2^k -1. So if k is prime, then m could be a Mersenne prime. But if m is a Mersenne prime, then 2^m ≡ 1 mod m. But we have 2^{m+1} ≡ 1 mod m. Let me see.

If m is prime, like m=3 (2^2 -1). Then 2^{4} =16. 16 mod 3 is 1. So yes, 3 divides 16-1=15. So 3 divides 15, which is true. So m=3, which is 2^2 -1, so n=4.

Similarly, m=7 (2^3 -1=7). Let's check: 2^{8}=256. 256 mod 7: 7*36=252, so 256-252=4. So 256 mod7=4. 256-1=255. 255 mod7: 7*36=252, 255-252=3. So 255 mod7=3, which is not zero. So 7 does not divide 255. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, so m=7 doesn't satisfy m divides 2^{m+1}-1.

Wait, so maybe m needs to be a Mersenne prime, but that doesn't seem to hold for m=7. Because 2^{7+1} = 256, 256 mod7=4, so 2^8-1=255 mod7=3, which isn't 0. So m=7 doesn't satisfy the condition. Hmm, maybe only certain exponents k will work.

Wait, let's test m=1: 2^{2} -1=3. 1 divides 3, yes. So n=2.

m=3: 2^4-1=15, 3 divides 15, yes.

What about m=15? Because 2^4 -1=15. So let's see, m=15. 2^{16}-1=65535. Does 15 divide 65535? Let's compute 65535 /15. 15 * 4369 = 65535, so yes. So m=15 works.

So n-1=15 →n=16.

Wait, but wait, n=16 is 2^4, which satisfies condition 1.

Now condition 3: n-2 divides 2^n -2.

So for n=2: n-2=0. Wait, division by zero is undefined. So n=2 is not acceptable because n-2=0 can't divide anything. So n=2 is invalid. So we can't include n=2.

Wait, but the first condition was n=2, but condition 3 would require (n-2)=0 divides 2^2 -2=2, which is undefined. So n=2 is invalid.

So let's go back. The possible n's are 1,4,8,16, etc.

Check n=1: condition 1: 1 divides 2^1=2 → yes.

Condition 2: n-1=0, which would have to divide 2^1 -1=1. But 0 can't divide anything, so condition 2 is undefined. So n=1 would not satisfy condition 2. Hmm, so n=1 is invalid as well.

Wait, that's a problem. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Because the first condition allows n=1, but condition 2 would have n-1=0, which is undefined. So perhaps n must be at least 2, but wait, for n=1: condition 2 is (n-1)=0, which would have to divide 2^1 -1=1. But division by zero is undefined, so n=1 doesn't satisfy condition 2.

Hmm, so that suggests that the only possible n's start from 4 upwards, perhaps.

Wait, but let's check n=4.

n=4: check conditions.

1. 4 divides 2^4=16 → yes, 16/4=4.

2. n-1=3 divides 2^4 -1=15 → 15/3=5 → yes.

3. n-2=2 divides 2^4 -2=14 → 14/2=7 → yes.

So n=4 satisfies all three conditions. So that's a candidate.

Next, let's try n=8.

Condition 1: 8 divides 2^8=256 → yes.

Condition 2: 7 divides 2^8-1=255. 255/7=36.428... Wait, 7*36=252, so 255-252=3 → remainder 3. So 7 does not divide 255. So condition 2 fails. So n=8 is invalid.

Hmm, so n=8 doesn't work. Let's try n=16.

Condition 1: 16 divides 2^16=65536 → yes.

Condition 2: n-1=15 divides 2^16-1=65535. 65535 ÷15=4369 → yes, because 15*4369=65535.

Condition 3: n-2=14 divides 2^16-2=65534. Let's compute 65534 divided by 14. 14*4681=65534 because 14*4000=56000, 14*600=8400 → 56000+8400=64400; 14*81=1134 → 64400+1134=65534. So yes, 14 divides 65534. So n=16 works.

So n=4 and n=16 work so far. Let's check n=32.

n=32: condition 1: 32 divides 2^32 → yes.

Condition 2: 31 divides 2^32-1. I'm not sure about that. Let me compute 2^32 mod31.

Wait, 2^5=32 ≡1 mod31, because 32-31=1. So 2^5 ≡1 mod31.

So 2^32 = (2^5)^6 * 2^2 → 1^6 *4=4 mod31. So 2^32 mod31=4. Thus, 2^32-1 mod31=3. So 31 does not divide 2^32-1. So condition 2 fails. So n=32 doesn't work.

Hmm, okay, so n=4 and n=16 work. Let's try n=64.

Condition 1: 64 divides 2^64 → yes.

Condition 2: 63 divides 2^64-1. So 63=7*9.

We can compute 2^64 mod7 and mod9.

Mod7: 2^3=8≡1 mod7. So 2^64= (2^3)^21 * 2^1 → 1^21 *2=2 mod7. So 2^64-1 ≡1 mod7. So 7 doesn't divide 2^64-1. So condition 2 fails. So n=64 is invalid.

Hmm, perhaps the next candidate is n=256. But let me see if there's a pattern. So far, n=4 and 16 work.

Wait, perhaps the exponents are such that m = n-1 is a product of Mersenne primes. Let me think. For n=4, n-1=3, which is a Mersenne prime (2^2-1). For n=16, n-1=15=3*5. Wait, 5 is 2^2 +1, which is a Fermat prime. Hmm, but 3 is a Mersenne prime.

Wait, maybe the pattern is that m = n-1 is a product of distinct Mersenne primes. Let me see: for n=4, m=3=3; for n=16, m=15=3*5. Wait, 5 is 2^4 -1 is 15, no, wait. 5 is 2^2 +1, which is a Fermat prime. Hmm, perhaps m needs to be a product of Fermat primes?

Alternatively, perhaps m is a number such that 2^{m+1} ≡1 mod m. So m must be a pseudoprime to base 2.

Wait, but perhaps m is a Carmichael number. Because Carmichael numbers satisfy Fermat's little theorem for all bases, so 2^{m} ≡2 mod m, but that's not directly helpful here.

Alternatively, maybe m must be a prime. Let's test m=3: prime, works. m=7: we saw earlier that 2^8 mod7=4, so 2^8-1=255 mod7=3≠0. So m=7, which is prime, doesn't work. So m being prime isn't sufficient.

Hmm, perhaps m must be a product of primes where each prime p satisfies that 2^{m+1}≡1 mod p. So, for each prime p dividing m, 2^{m+1} ≡1 mod p.

Wait, but that seems complicated. Let me check for n=16, m=15.

15=3*5.

Check for p=3: 2^{16} mod3. Since 2^2=4≡1 mod3, so 2^16=(2^2)^8 ≡1^8=1 mod3. So 2^16-1≡0 mod3. So yes.

For p=5: 2^{16} mod5. 2^4=16≡1 mod5, so 2^16=(2^4)^4≡1^4=1 mod5. So 2^16-1≡0 mod5. So yes, both 3 and5 divide 2^16-1, so 15 divides it. So m=15 works.

Similarly, for m=3, 2^4-1=15, which is divisible by3.

So perhaps m must be square-free and for each prime p dividing m, p-1 divides m. Because from group theory, the multiplicative order of 2 modulo p must divide p-1. So for 2^{m+1} ≡1 mod p, the order of 2 mod p must divide m+1 and also divide p-1 (by Fermat's theorem). So m+1 must be a multiple of the order of 2 modulo p. But this is getting a bit too abstract.

Alternatively, perhaps m must be such that m is a product of distinct Fermat primes. Because Fermat primes are of the form 2^{2^k}+1. The known Fermat primes are 3,5,17,257,65537. So if m is a product of these, then perhaps 2^{m} ≡1 mod m, but wait, no, because for m=15=3*5, 2^15=32768. 32768 mod3= (since 2^2=4≡1 mod3, 2^15= (2^2)^7 *2^1=1^7*2=2 mod3. So 2^15 mod3=2, which is not 1. So 2^15-1=32767 mod3=1. So 3 divides 32767, yes. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, for n=16, m=15. 2^{16}=65536. 65536 mod3=1, because 2^2=4≡1 mod3, so 2^16=(2^2)^8≡1^8=1 mod3. So 2^16-1=65535 ≡0 mod3. Similarly, 2^16 mod5=1, as 2^4=16≡1 mod5, so 2^16=(2^4)^4≡1 mod5. So 5 divides 2^16-1. So m=15 works because for each prime p in m, 2^{m+1} ≡1 mod p.

Wait, but m+1=16, and for p=3, 16 mod (p-1)=2. So 16 mod2=0, so 2^{16}≡(2^2)^8≡1^8=1 mod3.

Similarly, for p=5, p-1=4, 16 mod4=0, so 2^{16}=(2^4)^4≡1^4=1 mod5.

Ah, so for each prime p dividing m, m+1 must be a multiple of p-1. Because then 2^{m+1} ≡1 mod p, since 2^{p-1}≡1 mod p, and m+1 is a multiple of p-1.

So the condition is that for each prime p dividing m, (p-1) divides (m+1). So for m=3, p=3, p-1=2 divides m+1=4 → yes.

For m=15=3*5, check for p=3: 2 divides 16 → yes. For p=5: 4 divides 16 → yes. So m=15 works.

Similarly, check m=1: trivial, but n=2 is invalid because condition3 requires division by zero, which is undefined. So the valid m's are those where m is square-free, and for each prime p in m, (p-1) divides (m+1). Also, m must be one less than a power of 2, because n is a power of 2.

So, m must be of the form 2^k -1, and m must be square-free, and for each p|m, (p-1)|(m+1).

So let's see, possible m's:

For k=2: m=3 → 3 is prime. Check (3-1)=2 divides m+1=4 → yes.

k=4: m=15=3*5. Check (3-1)=2 divides 16 → yes. (5-1)=4 divides16 → yes.

k
