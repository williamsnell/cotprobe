Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question in front of me about behavioral psychology concepts. I'm a bit rusty on some of these terms, but let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question is asking about a behavior that's automatically elicited by an environmental stimulus. Hmm, that sounds familiar. I remember that in psychology, especially in learning theories, there are concepts like reflexes and conditioned responses. 

Wait, reflex... Reflex is an automatic response to a stimulus, right? Like when you touch something hot and you jerk your hand back without thinking. That's a reflex action. But then again, I also recall terms like conditioned response, which is part of classical conditioning. 

Conditioned response is when a neutral stimulus becomes associated with an unconditioned stimulus to elicit a response. For example, Pavlov's dogs salivating when they heard the bell ring because they associated it with food. But in that case, the salivation to the bell is a learned response, not an automatic one in the sense of being innate. 

So the question is about a behavior that's automatically elicited. That makes me think of a reflex, which is an innate, unlearned response. Reflexes are not learned; they're present from birth. Like blinking when something touches your eye or withdrawing a hand when it's pricked by a pin. These are immediate and not something you think about.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option F is reflex. That fits. But wait, let me check the other options to make sure I'm not mixing things up. 

Option A: aversive stimulus. That's something unpleasant that an organism tries to escape. Not related to automatic behavior per se. 

Option B: learned response. That would be something like a conditioned response, which is learned through experience, not automatic in the innate sense. 

Option C: conditioned response. As I thought earlier, that's a learned response. So not the automatic one the question is asking about. 

Option D: negative reinforcement. That's a concept from operant conditioning where an unpleasant stimulus is removed to increase a behavior. Not related. 

Option E: cognitive response. That involves thinking or processing information, so it's not automatic in the reflex sense. 

Option F: reflex. Yep, that's the automatic, unlearned response. 

Option G: condition. Not sure what that refers to here. Maybe a state or situation, but not relevant to the question. 

Option H: unconditioned stimulus. That's a stimulus that naturally and automatically triggers a response without any learning. Like the smell of food causing salivation. But the question is about the behavior, not the stimulus. 

Option I: reinforcement. That's about increasing the frequency of a behavior, again from operant conditioning. Not related. 

Option J: operant behavior. That's behavior that's influenced by its consequences, like rewards or punishments. Not an automatic response. 

So putting it all together, the behavior that's automatically elicited by an environmental stimulus is a reflex. So the correct answer should be option F.

The question asks about a behavior that is automatically elicited by an environmental stimulus. This concept aligns with the psychological term "reflex," which refers to an innate, unlearned response to a stimulus. Examples include withdrawing a hand from a hot object or blinking when something touches the eye. These reactions are immediate and not influenced by learning or cognition.

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Aversive stimulus** refers to an unpleasant stimulus, unrelated to automatic behavior.  
- **B: Learned response** involves behavior acquired through experience, not innate reflexes.  
- **C: Conditioned response** is a learned reaction in classical conditioning, not automatic in the innate sense.  
- **D: Negative reinforcement** pertains to operant conditioning and is unrelated.  
- **E: Cognitive response** involves thinking, not automatic reflexes.  
- **F: Reflex** is the correct term for an automatic, unlearned response.  
- **G: Condition** is vague and irrelevant here.  
- **H: Unconditioned stimulus** refers to a stimulus that naturally triggers a response, but the question focuses on the behavior, not the stimulus.  
- **I: Reinforcement** and **J: Operant behavior** relate to operant conditioning, not automatic responses.  

Thus, the behavior described is a reflex, making **F** the correct answer.

F
