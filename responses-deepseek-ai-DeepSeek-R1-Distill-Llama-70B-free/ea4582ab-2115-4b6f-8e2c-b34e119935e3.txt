Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about differential diagnosis between bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa. Hmm, I need to figure out the key feature that distinguishes them. Let me think.

I remember that both disorders are eating disorders, but they have distinct characteristics. Anorexia nervosa is typically characterized by self-starvation, leading to a very low body weight. People with anorexia often restrict their food intake and might exercise excessively. They have a fear of gaining weight and may see themselves as overweight even when they're underweight.

On the other hand, bulimia nervosa involves episodes of binge eating followed by purging. So, people with bulimia might eat a lot in a short time and then use methods like vomiting, laxatives, or excessive exercise to rid their body of the consumed calories. Their weight might be normal or even a bit overweight, but not as severely low as in anorexia.

The question asks about the key differential feature. Let's look at the options. Option A is the use of laxatives. Well, both disorders can use laxatives. Anorexics might use them to lose weight, and bulimics use them as a purging method. So that's not a distinguishing factor.

Option B is purging. Purging is more characteristic of bulimia, but I think some people with anorexia also purge. So maybe that's not the main differentiator.

Option C is fear of gaining weight. Both disorders have this fear. In fact, fear of gaining weight is a core feature of anorexia and is also present in bulimia. So this isn't the distinguishing factor.

Option D is bingeing. Binge eating is a hallmark of bulimia. Anorexia, especially the restrictive subtype, doesn't involve bingeing. So this could be a key differentiator.

Option E is excessive exercise. Both might exercise a lot. Anorexia patients often do, and bulimics might too, especially as a purging behavior. So this doesn't distinguish them.

Option F is all of the above. That can't be right because some options apply to both.

Option G is maintaining a normal body weight. Anorexia typically leads to being underweight, while bulimia might result in normal weight or even overweight. So this could be a key feature.

Option H is overeating in short periods. That's another way of describing bingeing, which is specific to bulimia.

Option I is none of the above. I don't think so, because there are distinguishing features.

Option J is self-imposed starvation, which is more anorexia.

Wait, the question is about a key feature. So, what's the main difference? Anorexia is about restrictive eating leading to low weight, while bulimia involves binging and purging, but may not be underweight.

So the key features would be the presence of bingeing (as in bulimia) versus the severe restriction and low weight (anorexia). Another key point is that anorexia has a restriction/purging subtype, but the primary behavior is restriction, while bulimia has the binge-purge cycle.

Looking back at the options, the question is about differential diagnosis. So, what's the main distinguishing factor?

I think the presence of binge eating is key for bulimia, and the very low weight is key for anorexia. So in the options, D is bingeing, and G is maintaining normal weight.

Wait, the question is about the differential diagnosis, so one of the options is the key feature. So, for example, if a patient has bingeing episodes, that points more towards bulimia. If they are severely underweight, that's anorexia.

So looking at the options, option D is bingeing, which is a key feature of bulimia. Option G is about normal weight, which might also be a differentiator.

But the question is about one of the key features. So which one is more specific?

Alternatively, another angle: the DSM-5 criteria. Anorexia nervosa is characterized by restricted eating leading to significantly low weight, fear of gaining weight, and disturbance in self-perceived weight. Bulimia nervosa involves recurrent episodes of binge eating followed by compensatory behaviors (like purging), and self-evaluation unduly influenced by body shape and weight.

So the key distinguishing feature is the presence of binge eating in bulimia versus the restriction and low weight in anorexia.

So, among the options, D (bingeing) would be a key feature for bulimia. G (maintaining normal weight) is also a differentiator because anorexia patients are typically underweight.

Wait, but the question asks for the key feature to make a differential diagnosis between the two. So perhaps the presence of bingeing (option D) is the key because anorexia doesn't have that. Or maybe maintaining normal weight (option G) is the key because anorexia is about being underweight.

I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

Bulimia patients might be normal weight or even overweight. Anorexia patients are underweight. So G could be a key feature.

But the question is about what differentiates them. So for a differential diagnosis, the presence of regular binge eating would indicate bulimia, while absence and severe restriction indicate anorexia.

So the options are D and G. Let's look at the options again.

The question is about one of the key features. So which is it?

Wait, the options are:

D: Bingeing

G: Maintaining a normal body weight.

So, for example, if a patient is bingeing, that would suggest bulimia. If they are at a normal weight, that points away from anorexia (though not exclusively, because anorexia can sometimes be at a normal weight if the patient is in a less severe state).

But I think the hallmark of bulimia is the binge-purge cycle, so D is a key feature. Anorexia is about restriction and low weight.

So the correct answer would be D: Bingeing.

Wait, but another thought: In the DSM-5, a key difference is that anorexia doesn't have regular binge-eating episodes. So when making a differential diagnosis between the two, the presence of binge eating would point to bulimia.

So the key feature is D: Bingeing.

Alternatively, maintaining a normal body weight (G) could also be a differentiator, because anorexia is associated with being underweight.

But the options are presented as 'one of the key features for making a differential diagnosis'. So both D and G could be distinguishing features. But the question is about which option is correct.

Looking back, the options are:

A: Use of laxatives

B: Purging

C: Fear of gaining weight

D: Bingeing

E: Excessive exercise

F: All of the above

G: Maintaining a normal body weight

H: Overeating in short periods

I: None of the above

J: Self-imposed starvation

Wait, option H is overeating in short periods, which is another way of saying bingeing. So D and H are similar.

Wait, no, H says 'over-eating in short periods' which is essentially the same as binging, which is option D.

So among the options, D and H are similar. But the correct answer would depend on the exact phrasing. Bingeing is a specific term used in the DSM.

So the key feature is the presence of bingeing in bulimia, which is not present in anorexia.

So the correct answer would be D: Bingeing.

Alternatively, another point: anorexia can have a binge-purge subtype, but the primary issue is restriction. So the presence of regular bingeing is more indicative of bulimia.

So I think the correct answer is D.

To differentiate between bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa, it is essential to identify key distinguishing features. Anorexia nervosa is characterized by restrictive eating, self-imposed starvation, and a significantly low body weight, driven by a fear of gaining weight. In contrast, bulimia nervosa is marked by recurrent episodes of binge eating followed by compensatory behaviors (e.g., purging, using laxatives, or excessive exercise) to prevent weight gain. While both disorders share some overlap in behaviors (e.g., purging or excessive exercise), the hallmark of bulimia nervosa is the presence of binge eating, which is absent in the restrictive subtype of anorexia nervosa.

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Use of laxatives** and **B: Purging** are not distinguishing features, as both disorders may involve these behaviors.
- **C: Fear of gaining weight** is common to both disorders and does not differentiate them.
- **D: Bingeing** is a key feature of bulimia nervosa and is absent in anorexia nervosa (except in the binge-purge subtype, which is less common and still distinct from bulimia).
- **E: Excessive exercise** is not a distinguishing feature, as it can occur in both disorders.
- **F: All of the above** is incorrect, as not all options are distinguishing features.
- **G: Maintaining a normal body weight** can be a differentiator, as anorexia nervosa typically results in significantly low weight, while bulimia nervosa may result in normal or overweight. However, this is less specific than bingeing.
- **H: Overeating in short periods** is synonymous with bingeing and thus overlaps with option D.
- **I: None of the above** is incorrect, as there are distinguishing features.
- **J: Self-imposed starvation** is more characteristic of anorexia nervosa but does not differentiate it from bulimia nervosa.

The most specific and key distinguishing feature is **D: Bingeing**, as it is a defining characteristic of bulimia nervosa and is absent in anorexia nervosa (except in the binge-purge subtype, which is distinct). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D**
