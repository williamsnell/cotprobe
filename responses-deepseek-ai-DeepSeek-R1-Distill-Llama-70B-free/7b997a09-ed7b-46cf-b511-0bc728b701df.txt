Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the energy change, ΔE, for a reaction. The reaction given is H₂(g) + (1/2)O₂(g) → H₂O(l). I remember that when dealing with such reactions, especially combustion reactions, the heat of combustion comes into play. 

The problem states that the heat of combustion of H₂(g) at 1 atm and 25°C is -68.32 kcal/mol⁻¹. Wait, heat of combustion is the energy released when a substance burns completely in oxygen. So in this case, when H₂ burns, it forms H₂O. 

But wait, the question gives the heat of combustion as -68.32 kcal per mol. Since it's negative, that means it's exothermic, which makes sense for a combustion reaction. But I need to find ΔE for the reaction as written. 

The reaction as written produces H₂O in the liquid state. Oh, right, the standard heat of combustion usually forms liquid water. So that should align with the given value. 

So the reaction equation is already balanced. Let me check: 2 H₂ would produce 2 H₂O, but here it's H₂ + ½ O₂ → H₂O. So the stoichiometry is correct. 

Wait, but the heat of combustion given is for the complete combustion of H₂. So for each mole of H₂ burned, it releases 68.32 kcal. Oh wait, but the sign is negative, so that's energy released.

But wait, the question asks for ΔE, which is the change in energy. In thermochemistry, ΔH (enthalpy change) is used, and for combustion, it's negative because it's exothermic. So the change here should match the heat of combustion.

But hold on, the problem is probably expecting the answer in kJ instead of kcal. Oh right, because the options are in kJ.

So, the given is -68.32 kcal per mole. To convert kcal to kJ, I remember that 1 kcal is approximately 4.184 kJ. So I'll multiply 68.32 by 4.184 to get the value in kJ.

Wait, no. Let me think. Since 1 kcal = 4.184 kJ, then 68.32 kcal is 68.32 * 4.184 kJ. Let me calculate that. 

68.32 * 4.184 = let's compute that. 68 *4 is 272, 0.32*4 is 1.28, so roughly 273.28, but more accurately:

Well, 68.32 *4 = 273.28, and 68.32 * 0.184 = let's compute that.

0.184 is approximately 0.18 + 0.004.

0.18 *68.32 = 12.2976
0.004 *68.32 = 0.27328
Adding them gives 12.2976 + 0.27328 = 12.57088
So total is 273.28 +12.57088 = 285.85088 kJ.

So the heat of combustion is -285.85 kJ per mole of H₂ burned. 

But wait, the reaction equation given is for the formation of one mole of H₂O. How does that relate to the heat of combustion?

Wait, the heat of combustion of H₂ is given as -68.32 kcal/mol⁻¹. So per mole of H₂ burned, that's the energy released.

The reaction as written is 1 mole of H₂ producing 1 mole of H₂O. So the ΔH for this reaction should be exactly -68.32 kcal/mol, which we converted to about -285.85 kJ/mol.

Looking at the options, option J is -285.9 kJ, which is very close to our calculation. But wait, let me double-check the calculation for any possible mistake.

Another way: 68.32 kcal * 4.184 kJ/kcal = ?

Let me compute it step by step.

68.32 * 4 = 273.28
0.184 * 68.32:

Compute 68.32 * 0.1 = 6.832
68.32 * 0.08 = 5.4656
68.32 * 0.004 = 0.27328
Adding these together: 6.832 +5.4656= 12.2976 + 0.27328=12.57088.

So total is 273.28 +12.57088=285.85088 kJ.

So approximately -285.85 kJ, which is about -285.9 kJ.

Looking at the options, option J is -285.9 kJ.

Wait, but the problem statement says "calculate the energy change, ΔE". I'm assuming ΔE is the same as ΔH in this context since it's under constant pressure, as the question states.

So the correct answer should be J: -285.9 kJ.

Wait, but why isn't it option H or something else? Let me make sure.

Wait, wait, the reaction is written as H₂ + ½ O₂ → H₂O(l). So it's the formation of one mole of H₂O. The heat of combustion of H₂ is the energy released when one mole of H₂ burns to form H₂O, which is exactly this reaction. So the ΔH is -68.32 kcal/mol, which is -285.85 kJ/mol. So the answer is J.

To calculate the energy change, ΔE, for the reaction **H₂(g) + (1/2)O₂(g) → H₂O(l)**, we use the given heat of combustion of H₂(g), which is **-68.32 kcal/mol**. This value represents the energy released when 1 mole of H₂ burns completely in oxygen to form liquid water, which aligns with the reaction provided.

Since the question asks for the energy change in **kJ**, we convert the heat of combustion from kcal to kJ using the conversion factor: **1 kcal = 4.184 kJ**. Thus:

\[
\Delta E = -68.32 \, \text{kcal/mol} \times 4.184 \, \text{kJ/kcal} = -285.85 \, \text{kJ/mol}.
\]

This matches the reaction as written, where 1 mole of H₂ reacts to form 1 mole of H₂O(l). The negative sign indicates that the reaction is exothermic.

Among the given options, the closest value to **-285.85 kJ** is **-285.9 kJ**, which corresponds to **option J**.
