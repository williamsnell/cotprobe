Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the percentage of survey respondents from China who reported paying a bribe in the last year to access public services. The question gives a list of services like education, judiciary, medical, etc., and I need to pick the correct percentage from the options A to J.

First, I'll try to remember if I've heard any statistics about bribery in China. I think China has been working on anti-corruption campaigns in recent years, so maybe the numbers have gone down, but I'm not sure about the exact figures.

I recall that organizations like Transparency International conduct surveys on corruption. They have something called the Global Corruption Barometer, which asks people about their experiences with bribery. Maybe the data comes from there.

I think that in some countries, the bribery rates can be quite high, especially in certain public sectors. But for China, I'm trying to remember if it's lower than average or not. I remember reading that while China has made progress in reducing corruption, it's still a significant issue in some areas.

Looking at the options, the percentages range from 10% to 90%. The options are A:66%, B:30%, C:70%, D:110% (which doesn't make sense because you can't have over 100% in a survey like this, so D is probably a mistake), E:86%, F:46%, G:90%, H:26%, I:50%, J:10%.

I know that 110% is impossible, so D is out. Now, considering the other options, I'm trying to think which is more plausible. If I remember correctly, in some of the Transparency International reports, countries like China have shown varying percentages. For example, in the 2017 report, I think the percentage was around 26%. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, no, maybe I'm confusing it with another country. Let me think again. I think that in China, the percentage might be lower than some other developing countries but still present. So perhaps in the range of 20-30%. Looking at the options, H is 26% and B is 30%. So between those two.

Alternatively, I might be mixing up the exact numbers. I've heard that in some regions, the bribery rate for accessing public services is around 25-30%. So maybe it's either 26% or 30%.

Another angle: sometimes the question is about paying a bribe in the last year, which might be a specific timeframe. If the data is from 2017, I should consider what the reports around that time said. Let me try to recall: I think that in 2017, China had made some strides in reducing corruption, so the percentage might have been lower. So perhaps 26% is more accurate, which is option H.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Another thought: sometimes the numbers can vary based on the specific services. For example, maybe in services like the police or judiciary, the rate might be higher, but the overall average could be lower. So if the average across all services is around 26%, that would make sense.

Alternatively, I've heard that in some countries, the percentage is higher, like around 30-40%, but I'm not sure about China specifically. If I had to guess, I'd lean towards the lower end because of the anti-corruption efforts.

So, putting it all together, I think the correct answer is H: 26%.

The correct answer is H: 26%.
