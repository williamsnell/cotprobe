Okay, so I've got this problem here: Find log 0.0364. And there are multiple-choice options from A to J. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on logarithms, but I'll try to work through it.

Wait, log usually refers to base 10 unless specified otherwise. So I'm assuming it's log base 10 here. So I need to find log₁₀(0.0364). Right.

I remember that logarithms can be negative when the number is between 0 and 1. Because log(1) is 0, and as the number decreases below 1, the log becomes negative. So 0.0364 is less than 1, so the log should be negative. That helps narrow down the options because all the options are negative except maybe none, but looking at the choices, all are negative, so that doesn't help much.

Let me think about how to compute this. Maybe I can express 0.0364 as a fraction or relate it to numbers I know the logs of. Alternatively, perhaps using logarithm properties.

Wait, 0.0364 is the same as 3.64 x 10^-2. So log(3.64 x 10^-2) equals log(3.64) + log(10^-2). Because log(a*b) = log a + log b. And log(10^-2) is -2 because 10^2 is 100, so 10^-2 is 0.01, and log(0.01) is -2.

So I have log(3.64) + (-2) = log(3.64) - 2.

Now I need to find log(3.64). I remember that log(3.162) is 0.5 because 10^0.5 is sqrt(10) which is about 3.162. And log(3.64) is a bit higher than that. Alternatively, maybe I should recall that log(3.6) is around 0.5563. Wait, let me think more accurately.

I think log(3) is approximately 0.4771, log(4) is 0.6021. So 3.64 is between 3 and 4, closer to 3.6 perhaps. Let me try to approximate.

Wait, maybe using a more precise method. Let me break 3.64 down. I know that 3.64 is 364/100, but not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps using logarithm tables in my mind.

Alternatively, I can use the fact that 3.64 is 10^x, and find x such that 10^x = 3.64. Then x is log(3.64).

Wait, I remember that 10^0.56 is about 3.63. Let me check: 10^0.56. Let's compute 10^0.5 is sqrt(10)=3.162, 10^0.55 is about 3.548 (since each 0.01 increase adds roughly 0.023 in the value, but I'm not exact here). Alternatively, perhaps better to use linear approximation.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to remember that log(3.6) is approximately 0.5563. Let me confirm that. Wait, I think log(3.6) is about 0.5563025007. So log(3.64) would be a bit higher than that. Let me see, the difference between 3.6 and 3.64 is 0.04. So from 3.6 to 3.64, it's a 1.111% increase. So the log would increase by approximately the derivative of log(x) at x=3.6 times 0.04.

The derivative of log₁₀(x) is 1/(x ln10). So at x=3.6, ln10 is about 2.302585, so 1/(3.6 * 2.302585) ≈ 1/(8.2893) ≈ 0.1206 per unit x. So the change in x is 0.04, so change in log(x) is approximately 0.04 * 0.1206 ≈ 0.0048. So log(3.64) ≈ 0.5563 + 0.0048 = 0.5611.

Wait, but maybe this is getting too precise. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the known values. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that 3.64 is 3.6 * 1.0111, so using logarithm approximation: log(3.6 * 1.0111) = log(3.6) + log(1.0111). And log(1.0111) is approximately 0.0048 (since for small x, ln(1+x) ≈ x, and log(1+x) ≈ x / ln(10)). So 0.0111 / 2.3026 ≈ 0.0048. So yes, 0.5563 + 0.0048 = 0.5611.

So log(3.64) ≈ 0.5611. So putting it back, log(0.0364) = log(3.64) -2 ≈ 0.5611 - 2 = -1.4389.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is -1.4389. So that would be the answer. But wait, let me double-check because sometimes approximations can be off.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute more accurately. Let's see, another approach: using common logs.

Another approach: express 0.0364 as 364 x 10^-4, so log(0.0364) = log(364) + log(10^-4) = log(364) -4.

But wait, 364 is 3.64 x 10^2, so log(364) = log(3.64) + 2. So log(0.0364) = log(3.64) + 2 -4 = log(3.64) -2, which brings us back to the same point.

So perhaps using a calculator-like approach in mind, but since I don't have a calculator, I have to rely on approximations.

Wait, another thought: perhaps using known squares. Let's see, 0.0364 is approximately 0.036. Let me think, 0.036 is 3.6 x 10^-2. Wait, but that's similar to before.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that 0.0364 is 364 ten-thousandths, so 364/10000. But I'm not sure if that helps.

Wait, another approach: using the logarithm of 0.0364, perhaps express it in terms of square roots or exponents.

Wait, perhaps I can think of 0.0364 as 0.19^2. Let me compute 0.19^2: 0.19 * 0.19 = 0.0361. Oh, that's very close to 0.0364. So 0.0364 = 0.19^2 + a tiny bit more. So sqrt(0.0364) is approximately 0.1907.

So, log(0.0364) = log( (0.1907)^2 ) = 2 log(0.1907).

Hmm, but now I need to find log(0.1907). Let me see, 0.1907 is approximately 0.2, and log(0.2) is log(2 x 10^-1) = log(2) -1 ≈ 0.3010 -1 = -0.6990.

But 0.1907 is 0.2 minus 0.0093, so a bit less than 0.2. So log(0.1907) would be slightly less than -0.6990. Let me compute it more accurately.

Using the approximation again: near x=0.2, the derivative of log(x) is 1/(x ln10) ≈ 1/(0.2 * 2.3026) ≈ 1/(0.4605) ≈ 2.17 per unit x. Wait, but when x decreases by Δx, the log decreases by (Δx) * (1/(x ln10)).

So here, x = 0.2, Δx = -0.0093. So the change in log(x) would be approximately (-0.0093) * (1/(0.2 * 2.3026)) ≈ (-0.0093) * (2.17) ≈ -0.0202.

So log(0.1907) ≈ log(0.2) - 0.0202 ≈ (-0.6990) - 0.0202 = -0.7192.

Then, log(0.0364) = 2 * (-0.7192) ≈ -1.4384. That's very close to option A, which is -1.4389. So that's consistent with my earlier approximation.

Another way: perhaps using more precise logarithm values.

Wait, I think the exact value of log(3.64) is approximately 0.5611, as I thought earlier. So 0.5611 - 2 = -1.4389, which matches option A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C is -1.5912, which is more negative. So why isn't that the case? Did I make a mistake in my calculation?

Wait, perhaps I should check another approach. Let's see, 0.0364 can be written as 3.64 x 10^-2, so log(0.0364) = log(3.64) + (-2). As before.

Alternatively, perhaps using more precise log values. Let me recall some exact log values.

Wait, I know that log(3.6) is approximately 0.5563. Then, for 3.64, the increase from 3.6 to 3.64 is 0.04, so using the derivative approach again.

The derivative of log(x) at x=3.6 is 1/(3.6 * ln(10)) ≈ 1/(3.6 * 2.302585) ≈ 1/8.2893 ≈ 0.1206 per unit x. So for a Δx of 0.04, the Δlog ≈ 0.04 * 0.1206 ≈ 0.0048. So log(3.64) ≈ 0.5563 + 0.0048 = 0.5611. So yes, that's correct.

So subtracting 2 gives us 0.5611 - 2 = -1.4389. So the correct answer should be option A.

But wait, let me think again. Sometimes, when dealing with logs, it's easy to make a mistake with the exponents. Let me make sure I didn't mix up the exponents.

Wait, 0.0364 is 3.64 x 10^-2? Wait no, 3.64 x 10^-2 is 0.0364? Wait, 10^-2 is 0.01, so 3.64 x 0.01 is 0.0364. Yes, correct.

So log(3.64 x 10^-2) = log(3.64) + log(10^-2) = log(3.64) - 2.

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps using the logarithm table approach. For example, looking up log(364) because 0.0364 is 364 x 10^-4, so log(364) is log(3.64 x 10^2) = log(3.64) + 2. Therefore, log(0.0364) = log(364 x 10^-4) = log(364) - 4. Which is [log(3.64) + 2] -4 = log(3.64) -2. Same result.

So I think my calculation is correct, leading to -1.4389, which is option A.

To find **log 0.0364**, we assume it refers to base 10. Since 0.0364 is less than 1, the logarithm will be negative. We can express 0.0364 as **3.64 × 10⁻²**, so:

\[
\log(0.0364) = \log(3.64 \times 10^{-2}) = \log(3.64) + \log(10^{-2})
\]

Using the property of logarithms, \(\log(10^{-2}) = -2\). Therefore:

\[
\log(0.0364) = \log(3.64) - 2
\]

Next, we approximate \(\log(3.64)\). Knowing that \(\log(3.162) = 0.5\) (since \(10^{0.5} = \sqrt{10} \approx 3.162\)) and \(\log(3.6)\) is approximately 0.5563, we estimate \(\log(3.64)\) to be slightly higher than 0.5563. Using linear approximation:

- The derivative of \(\log(x)\) at \(x = 3.6\) is \(\frac{1}{x \ln(10)} \approx \frac{1}{3.6 \times 2.3026} \approx 0.1206\).
- For a small increase of \(0.04\) in \(x\) (from 3.6 to 3.64), the change in \(\log(x)\) is approximately \(0.04 \times 0.1206 \approx 0.0048\).

Thus, \(\log(3.64) \approx 0.5563 + 0.0048 = 0.5611\). Substituting this back:

\[
\log(0.0364) = 0.5611 - 2 = -1.4389
\]

This matches **option A**. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: -1.4389**
