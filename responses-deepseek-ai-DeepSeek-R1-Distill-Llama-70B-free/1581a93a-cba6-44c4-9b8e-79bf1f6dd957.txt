Okay, so I've got this question about the Internal-External Control Scale, also known as the locus of control. Hmm, I remember that this scale measures whether people believe their outcomes are due to their own actions (internal) or due to external factors like chance or others (external). 

The question is asking about the sex and race differences found on this scale. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact findings, so I'll need to think through what I've learned before.

From what I recall, in terms of sex differences, some studies suggest that women tend to have a more external locus of control than men. Wait, no, waitâ€”maybe it's the opposite. I think that men might be more internal. Because traditional gender roles might lead men to feel more in control of their environment, so they'd score higher on internal. So women might be more external because they might feel less control, perhaps due to societal factors or discrimination.

Wait, or was it the other way around? I think I read that men usually score as more internal, so women would be more external on average. So that would mean, for example, that men believe their successes or failures are due to their own efforts, while women might attribute them more to external factors.

Now, regarding race differences, I'm not as sure. I think some research has indicated that African Americans might have a more external locus of control compared to whites. This could be due to historical and systemic factors like racism and discrimination, which might make individuals feel that their outcomes are controlled by external circumstances beyond their control.

Putting this together, the options are looking for which combination is correct. Let's look at the options again.

Option C says: Women are more external than men and blacks are more external than whites. That fits with what I was thinking. Because if women are more external and blacks are more external, that would fit.

Other options: Let's see. Option E says no sex difference but blacks more external. But I think there is a sex difference. Option I says men are more internal and blacks are more internal, which doesn't fit. Option C seems correct.

Wait, but wait, let me think again. I'm a bit confused because sometimes findings can vary based on the study. But I think the general consensus is that men are more internal than women, and African Americans may be more external than whites.

So looking again, option C says women more external than men and blacks more external than whites. Yes, that matches.

The Internal-External Control Scale measures whether individuals attribute their outcomes to internal factors (their own actions) or external factors (circumstances beyond their control). Research suggests that men tend to score higher on internal control, believing their outcomes result from their own efforts, while women often score higher on external control, attributing outcomes to external factors. This difference may stem from societal roles and expectations. Additionally, studies indicate that African Americans may have a more external locus of control compared to whites, potentially due to systemic factors like discrimination and racism. 

Given these findings, the correct answer is that women are more external than men, and blacks are more external than whites.
