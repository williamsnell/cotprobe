Okay, so I have this question about joint tenancy and what happens when one of the joint tenants transfers their interest. Hmm, I remember that joint tenancy has something called the right of survivorship. So, if two people own a property as joint tenants, when one dies, the other automatically gets the entire property, right?

The question says a sister and brother own a ranch as joint tenants. The sister transfers her interest using a quitclaim deed to her friend without the brother knowing. I need to figure out what interest the friend ends up with.

Wait, what's a quitclaim deed? From what I recall, a quitclaim deed transfers whatever interest the grantor has, but it doesn't guarantee they have good title. So if the sister didn't have a good claim, the friend gets whatever she had, which might be nothing. But in this case, the sister does own half as a joint tenant.

Now, when a joint tenant transfers their interest, what happens? I think that by transferring, the joint tenancy is severed. So the sister's share is no longer part of the joint tenancy. But what does that mean for the friend?

In joint tenancy, each has an undivided interest. So the sister had an undivided 50% interest. When she transfers it, the friend gets that 50% as a tenant in common, not joint tenant. Because joint tenancy requires four unities: time, title, interest, and possession. If one transfers their interest, the unities are broken, so the joint tenancy is severed.

So after the transfer, the brother still has his 50% as a joint tenant, and the sister's 50% is now transferred. But wait, no, actually, when the sister transfers her interest, the joint tenancy is severed, so each holds their own 50% as tenants in common. So the friend gets the sister's 50%, and the brother still has his 50%, but now it's as tenants in common, not joint tenants.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. So when a joint tenant sells their interest, does the buyer become a tenant in common with the other joint tenant? Yes, I think that's right. Because the joint tenancy can't continue with someone outside the original two. So the friend would now own 50% as a tenant in common with the brother.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option E says an undivided one-half interest without right of survivorship. That sounds correct because as a tenant in common, each owns an undivided half, and there's no right of survivorship. Option G says tenancy in common with the brother, which is correct in a way, but the question is about the friend's interest. So E is the interest type, and G is the type of tenancy.

Wait, what's the difference between E and G? Option E is describing the interest, while G is describing the type of ownership (tenancy in common). So the friend's interest is an undivided one-half without survivorship, so the correct answer would be E.

Alternatively, another thought: when the sister transfers her interest, does the friend step into her place as a joint tenant? No, because the brother wasn't part of the transfer, and the four unities are broken. So the joint tenancy is severed, and the ownership becomes a tenancy in common between the brother and the friend. So each holds a 50% undivided interest as tenants in common. Therefore, the friend's interest is an undivided one-half without survivorship.

So the correct answer should be E.

When a sister and brother own a ranch as joint tenants, they each hold an undivided 50% interest in the property with the right of survivorship. If the sister transfers her interest using a quitclaim deed to her friend, the joint tenancy is severed. This is because the "four unities" of joint tenancy (time, title, interest, and possession) are broken when one joint tenant transfers their interest to a third party.

As a result, the sister's 50% interest is transferred to the friend, and the ownership structure becomes a tenancy in common between the friend and the brother. In a tenancy in common, each party owns an undivided 50% interest in the property, but there is no right of survivorship. The friend now holds an undivided one-half interest in the ranch without the right of survivorship.

Among the options provided, the correct answer is:

E: An undivided one-half interest without right of survivorship.

Answer: E
