Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which cognitive assessment tool is best for a nonverbal adolescent. Hmm, let's break this down. The question is asking for a measure of general cognitive abilities, and the key point is that the individual is nonverbal, meaning they might not respond well to tests that rely heavily on verbal instructions or responses.

Looking at the options, I remember that some tests are more verbal while others are nonverbal. For example, the Wechsler scales like the WISC-IV (option A) and WAIS-IV (option I) have both verbal and performance sections. But if the person is nonverbal, maybe those aren't the best fit because they require a lot of verbal interaction.

Then there's the Ravens Progressive Matrices (option G). I've heard that Ravens is a nonverbal test. It uses matrices and doesn't require spoken language, so that could be a good option. It's often used to assess reasoning abilities without relying on verbal skills.

Another option is the Leiter-R (option J). I think that's also a nonverbal test. It's designed for children and adolescents and uses visual stimuli. It doesn't require reading or verbal responses, which makes it suitable for nonverbal individuals.

What about the other options? Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children-II (B), Cognitive Assessment System-II (C), Woodcock-Johnson IV (D), Differential Ability Scales-II (E), and Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence-IV (F) might have more verbal components. The Stanford-Binet (H) does have nonverbal sections, but I'm not sure if it's entirely nonverbal or just has some parts. Also, considering the age, the adolescent might need a test that's appropriate for their age group.

So between G and J, which one is better suited? The Leiter-R is specifically designed to be nonverbal and for a wide age range, including adolescents. Ravens is also nonverbal, but I think it's often used for a bit older individuals or maybe more for specific reasoning assessments. But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, maybe both G and J are possible, but looking at the options again, J is Leiter-R, which is known for being nonverbal and suitable for adolescents who can't respond verbally.

Wait, but the question is about general cognitive abilities. The Leiter-R measures nonverbal intelligence, which is part of general cognitive abilities. So it fits. The Ravens might assess more specific areas like fluid intelligence or reasoning, but perhaps isn't as comprehensive for general cognitive assessment.

So I'm leaning towards J: Leiter-R as the answer because it's designed for nonverbal assessment across various ages, including adolescents, and measures general cognitive abilities without relying on verbal communication.

The Leiter-R is the most appropriate measure for assessing general cognitive abilities in a nonverbal adolescent. It is specifically designed for nonverbal individuals, uses visual stimuli, and is suitable for adolescents, making it ideal for this scenario.

Answer: J
