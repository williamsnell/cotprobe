Okay, so I've got this banking question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The bank has made $100,000 in loans and has excess reserves of $25,000. The required reserve ratio is 10%. I need to find the demand deposit liabilities. Hmm, right. I remember that banks have reserves and loans as assets, and demand deposits (and others) as liabilities.

Wait, the question mentions that other liabilities and net worth are matched by assets other than loans and reserves. So, maybe that part of the balance sheet is balanced elsewhere, and I don't need to worry about it for this calculation. So I can focus on the parts related to loans, reserves, and demand deposits.

So, banks must hold a certain percentage of their deposits as reserves. The required reserve ratio is 10%, which means they must keep 10% of their demand deposits in reserves. But they have excess reserves of $25,000, which means they're holding more than required.

Let me think about the reserves. The total reserves would be required reserves plus excess reserves. Or wait, no, the excess is the amount they have over the required. So total reserves are required reserves plus excess reserves.

But another approach is that the bank's total reserves are equal to required reserves plus excess reserves. Wait, no. Required reserves are the minimum they must hold against deposits. Excess reserves are any additional reserves beyond that. So total reserves = required reserves + excess reserves.

But wait, the problem gives me the excess reserves as $25,000. So if I can find the required reserves, I can get total reserves. But maybe I don't need that. Let me try another angle.

The formula I remember is: Total Reserves = Required Reserves + Excess Reserves. But for the purpose of calculating required reserves, it's based on demand deposits.

So, required reserves (RR) are 10% of demand deposits (DD). So RR = 0.10 * DD.

But the bank's total reserves are equal to RR plus excess reserves. So:

Total Reserves = RR + Excess Reserves
= (0.10 * DD) + $25,000.

But wait, the total reserves the bank has is also a part of their assets. On the asset side, the bank has loans and reserves. So the total assets are loans plus reserves. Let me see.

The assets are Loans + Reserves. The problem says the bank has made $100,000 in loans. So:

Assets = $100,000 (loans) + Reserves.

Liabilities include demand deposits and other liabilities. But the question says that other liabilities and net worth are matched by assets other than loans and reserves. So, those other assets (maybe securities or something else) would cover those other liabilities and net worth. So for this problem, I can ignore those and just focus on the demand deposits and the corresponding required and excess reserves.

So, the bank's balance sheet must balance: Assets = Liabilities.

So, Assets = Loans + Reserves
Liabilities = Demand Deposits + Other Liabilities

But since Other Liabilities and Net Worth are matched by other assets, I can consider that:

Loans + Reserves = Demand Deposits + (Other Liabilities matched by other assets)

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps I should think that the total assets are loans plus reserves plus other assets. But the problem says that other liabilities and net worth are matched by other assets, so maybe other assets = other liabilities + net worth. So the main equation I can write is:

Loans + Reserves = Demand Deposits + (Other Liabilities + Net Worth)

But since other Liabilities + Net Worth = Other Assets, which are covered, perhaps I don't need to include them in this equation. Alternatively, perhaps I can model it as Loans + Reserves = Demand Deposits + (excess beyond required reserves? No, that doesn't make sense.)

Wait, maybe I should approach this from the reserve requirement perspective. The bank must hold 10% of demand deposits as reserves. So required reserves are 0.10 * DD.

The bank's total reserves are the required reserves plus any excess. So total reserves = 0.10 * DD + $25,000.

But the total reserves are part of the assets, along with the loans. So:

Loans + Reserves = Assets

But on the liability side, demand deposits plus other liabilities and net worth equal assets. But as given, other liabilities and net worth are matched by other assets, which I'm not considering here. So I can model the equation as:

Loans + Reserves = Demand Deposits + (Other Liabilities + Net Worth)

But since Other Liabilities + Net Worth = Other Assets, which are separate from Loans and Reserves, perhaps the equation simplifies to:

Loans + Reserves = Demand Deposits + (something not related). Hmm, maybe I'm complicating it.

An alternative approach is to think that the total liabilities (which include demand deposits) must equal total assets. So:

Demand Deposits + Other Liabilities + Net Worth = Loans + Reserves + Other Assets

But the problem states that Other Liabilities + Net Worth are matched by Other Assets. So:

Other Liabilities + Net Worth = Other Assets

Which means, when substituted into the equation:

Demand Deposits + (Other Liabilities + Net Worth) = Loans + Reserves + (Other Liabilities + Net Worth)

So we can cancel out the (Other Liabilities + Net Worth) terms from both sides:

Demand Deposits = Loans + Reserves

Wait, that can't be right because the right side includes reserves, which are part of the assets. Alternatively, perhaps I should think that Demand Deposits must equal the sum of required reserves and the loans, plus other things, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model the balance sheet. The bank's balance sheet must balance:

Assets = Liabilities + Net Worth

But the problem says that Other Liabilities and Net Worth are matched by Other Assets. So, let's break it down.

Total Assets = Loans + Reserves + Other Assets

Total Liabilities = Demand Deposits + Other Liabilities

Net Worth = Net Worth

Given that Other Assets = Other Liabilities + Net Worth (from the problem statement), so substituting:

Total Assets = Loans + Reserves + (Other Liabilities + Net Worth)

But the balance sheet equation is:

Loans + Reserves + Other Assets = Demand Deposits + Other Liabilities + Net Worth

Substituting Other Assets:

Loans + Reserves + (Other Liabilities + Net Worth) = Demand Deposits + Other Liabilities + Net Worth

Canceling Other Liabilities and Net Worth from both sides:

Loans + Reserves = Demand Deposits

So, Demand Deposits = Loans + Reserves

Wait, that makes sense. So the equation is:

Demand Deposits = Loans + Reserves

Because the rest of the balance sheet cancels out.

But wait, the bank's Reserves are made up of required and excess. So Reserves = Required Reserves + Excess Reserves

Required Reserves = 0.10 * Demand Deposits

So, substituting:

Demand Deposits = Loans + (0.10 * Demand Deposits + Excess Reserves)

We can plug in the values:

Loans = $100,000

Excess Reserves = $25,000

So:

DD = 100,000 + (0.10 * DD + 25,000)

Let me write that equation:

DD = 100,000 + 0.10 DD + 25,000

Simplify the right side:

100,000 +25,000 = 125,000, so:

DD = 125,000 + 0.10 DD

Subtract 0.10 DD from both sides:

DD - 0.10 DD = 125,000

0.90 DD = 125,000

So, DD = 125,000 / 0.90 = ?

Calculating that: 125,000 divided by 0.9.

Let me compute 125,000 / 0.9.

Well, 125,000 * (10/9) = 125,000 * 1.1111... â‰ˆ 138,888.89

Wait, that's approximately 138,888.89.

Looking at the options, option B is $138,889. So that would be the answer.

Wait, let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. The balance sheet equation simplifies to DD = Loans + Reserves because Other Assets = Other Liabilities + Net Worth, which cancels out those terms.

2. Reserves consist of required and excess. Required Reserves = 0.10 * DD.

3. So Reserves = 0.10 * DD + 25,000.

4. Substituting into DD = 100,000 + (0.10 DD + 25,000)

5. DD = 125,000 + 0.10 DD

6. Subtract 0.10 DD: 0.90 DD = 125,000

7. DD = 125,000 / 0.9 = approx 138,888.89.

Yes, that makes sense. So the demand deposits are approximately $138,889, which is option B.

To determine the bank's demand deposit liabilities, we start by analyzing the balance sheet and the given information:

1. **Balance Sheet Simplification**:  
   The problem states that "other liabilities and net worth are matched by assets other than loans and reserves." This means these components cancel out, simplifying the balance sheet equation to:  
   \[
   \text{Demand Deposits} = \text{Loans} + \text{Reserves}
   \]

2. **Reserves Composition**:  
   Reserves consist of required reserves and excess reserves:  
   \[
   \text{Reserves} = \text{Required Reserves} + \text{Excess Reserves}
   \]  
   Required reserves are 10% of demand deposits:  
   \[
   \text{Required Reserves} = 0.10 \times \text{Demand Deposits}
   \]  
   Excess reserves are given as $25,000. Substituting:  
   \[
   \text{Reserves} = 0.10 \times \text{Demand Deposits} + 25,000
   \]

3. **Substitute Reserves into the Balance Sheet Equation**:  
   From the simplified balance sheet:  
   \[
   \text{Demand Deposits} = \text{Loans} + \text{Reserves}
   \]  
   Substituting the expression for reserves:  
   \[
   \text{Demand Deposits} = 100,000 + (0.10 \times \text{Demand Deposits} + 25,000)
   \]  
   Simplify the equation:  
   \[
   \text{Demand Deposits} = 125,000 + 0.10 \times \text{Demand Deposits}
   \]

4. **Solve for Demand Deposits**:  
   Subtract \(0.10 \times \text{Demand Deposits}\) from both sides:  
   \[
   \text{Demand Deposits} - 0.10 \times \text{Demand Deposits} = 125,000
   \]  
   Factor out demand deposits:  
   \[
   0.90 \times \text{Demand Deposits} = 125,000
   \]  
   Divide both sides by 0.90:  
   \[
   \text{Demand Deposits} = \frac{125,000}{0.90} \approx 138,888.89
   \]

5. **Final Answer**:  
   The demand deposit liabilities are approximately $138,889, which corresponds to option **B**.
