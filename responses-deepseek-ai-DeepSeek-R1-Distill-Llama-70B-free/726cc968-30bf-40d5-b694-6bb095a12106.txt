Okay, so I need to figure out the total flight time of a soccer ball that's been kicked. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from physics class. Oh right, when you kick a ball, it follows a projectile motion. So the flight time depends on the initial velocity and the launch angle.

Wait, the initial velocity is given as 10 m/s at a 30-degree angle. So I should break this into horizontal and vertical components. Oh right, the vertical component affects the time it's in the air because gravity acts on that.

So the vertical component of the velocity is V0y = V0 * sin(theta). V0 is 10 m/s and theta is 30 degrees. Sin of 30 is 0.5, so V0y is 10 * 0.5 = 5 m/s.

Now, the time the ball stays in the air. I remember that the time to reach maximum height is when the vertical velocity becomes zero. The formula is V = V0y - g*t, where V is final velocity (0 at the peak), g is 9.8 m/s², t is time. So 0 = 5 - 9.8*t. Solving for t gives t = 5 / 9.8 ≈ 0.51 seconds. That's the time to reach the top.

But wait, the total flight time is twice that because the ball goes up and then comes back down. So total time is 2 * 0.51 ≈ 1.02 seconds. Hmm, looking at the options, option G is 1s, J is 1.5s. Maybe I should calculate it more accurately without rounding.

Let me redo the calculation without approximating. So V0y is 5 m/s. The time to reach the peak is t = (5) / (9.8) = 5/9.8. Let's compute that exactly. 5 divided by 9.8 is approximately 0.5102 seconds.

So the total time is 2 * 0.5102 ≈ 1.0204 seconds. That's about 1.02 seconds. Looking at the options, the closest is option G: 1s, but there's also option J: 1.5s which is a bit higher. Wait, wait, maybe I missed something.

Wait, maybe I should double-check the formula. Oh wait, another approach uses the equation for the time of flight: T = (2 * V0y) / g. So plugging in the numbers: 2 * 5 / 9.8. 2*5 is 10, so 10/9.8 is approximately 1.0204 seconds. Yep, same as before.

Looking at the options, the closest would be option G: 1s, but wait, is there another option closer to 1.02s? Let me check the options again. The options are A:4, B:3, C:0.75, D:2, E:1.25, F:5, G:1, H:2.5, I:0.5, J:1.5. So 1.02 is closer to 1s than to 1.5s. But wait, maybe the question expects an exact answer. Let me think about using more precise calculations.

Wait, 5 divided by 9.8 is exactly 0.510204... So times two is 1.020408... So approximately 1.02 seconds. So the correct answer should be just over 1 second. Among the options, G is 1s, which is the closest. But wait, another thought: sometimes, in these problems, does the ball's flight time include both ascending and descending, which I've considered. So yes, 1.02s is correct.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculations. Let me think: if V0y is 5 m/s, the time to reach the peak is 5/9.8 ≈ 0.5102 s. So the total time is twice that, 1.0204 s. So 1.02 seconds. So the correct answer is approximately 1 second. But wait, what if the question uses g as 10 m/s² for simplicity?

Oh, that's a possibility. Sometimes in problems, they take g as 10 to make the math easier. Let me try that. If g is 10, then V0y is 5, so time up is 5/10 = 0.5s. So total time is 1s. So in that case, the answer is exactly 1s, which is option G.

But wait, the question says to assume air resistance is negligible, which is standard, but doesn't specify the value of g. So probably, in the problem, they expect you to use g=9.8, which gives 1.02s. But the closest option is G:1s. Alternatively, perhaps the options would have a 1s or a 1.02s option, but since 1.02 is not an option, 1s is the closest.

Wait, looking again, the options are: G is 1s, E is 1.25s, J is 1.5. So 1.02 is closest to G:1s.

Therefore, the answer should be G: 1s.

To determine the total flight time of the soccer ball, we analyze its vertical motion under the influence of gravity. The ball is kicked with an initial velocity of \( V_0 = 10 \, \text{m/s} \) at a launch angle of \( \theta = 30^\circ \). The vertical component of the initial velocity is given by:

\[
V_{0y} = V_0 \sin(\theta) = 10 \cdot \sin(30^\circ) = 10 \cdot 0.5 = 5 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

The time it takes for the ball to reach its maximum height is when the vertical velocity becomes zero. Using the equation \( V_y = V_{0y} - g t \), where \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), we solve for \( t \):

\[
0 = 5 - 9.8 t \implies t = \frac{5}{9.8} \approx 0.5102 \, \text{s}.
\]

This is the time to reach the peak. Since the total flight time includes both the ascent and descent, we double this value:

\[
T = 2 \cdot t = 2 \cdot 0.5102 \approx 1.0204 \, \text{s}.
\]

Thus, the total flight time is approximately \( 1.02 \, \text{s} \). Among the given options, the closest value is \( 1 \, \text{s} \), corresponding to option G. 

If \( g \) were approximated as \( 10 \, \text{m/s}^2 \) for simplicity, the calculation would yield \( T = 1 \, \text{s} \) exactly, further supporting option G.
