Okay, so I've got this question here about the fraction of empty space in liquid nitrogen using a hard-sphere model. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think through it.

The question gives me the molecular diameter of N2 as 3.15e-8 cm, which I guess is the value from the van der Waals 'b' parameter. And the density is 0.8081 g/cm³. I need to find the fraction of the liquid volume that's empty space.

Wait, so in a hard-sphere model, the molecules are considered as solid spheres that can't compress. The packing would determine how much space is occupied. I remember that the maximum packing efficiency for spheres is about 74% for face-centered cubic or hexagonal close packing. But wait, that's for crystals. Liquids are a bit less dense, maybe around 50-70%? Hmm, but I'm not sure. Maybe in this problem, it's assuming a different approach.

Wait, no. The problem says to calculate the fraction of empty space, so I think it's based on the assumption that the molecules are packed as closely as possible, and the empty space is the rest.

I think the approach is to calculate the volume per molecule in the liquid and then compare it to the volume each molecule would occupy in a close-packed arrangement.

So the molecular diameter is given, so the radius is half of that. The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³. But wait, the question is about the volume each molecule occupies in the liquid and the volume each would take in a close-packed structure.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of molar volume and Avogadro's number. Let's see.

First, find the molar mass of N2. Nitrogen has an atomic weight of about 14 g/mol, so N2 is 28 g/mol.

The density is given as 0.8081 g/cm³. So, the molar volume would be the molar mass divided by density. So molar volume Vm = (28 g/mol) / (0.8081 g/cm³) = let me calculate that. 28 divided by 0.8081 is approximately 34.67 cm³/mol.

Wait, wait, no, because 0.8081 is the density. So 28 grams is a mole, so 28 / 0.8081 is the volume in cm³. Let me compute: 28 / 0.8081 ≈ 34.67 cm³/mol.

Now, the volume per molecule would be Vm divided by Avogadro's number. Avogadro's number is about 6.022e23 molecules/mol.

So volume per molecule, V_molecule = 34.67 cm³/mol / 6.022e23 molecules/mol = approx 5.76e-23 cm³/molecule.

Wait, but alternatively, the volume each molecule would occupy if packed in a sphere would be based on their diameter. So the volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, but again, considering the packing.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The molecular diameter is 3.15e-8 cm, so the radius is 1.575e-8 cm.

The volume of one molecule is (4/3)π*(1.575e-8 cm)^3. Let me calculate that: 1.575e-8 cubed is (approx) 3.9e-24 cm³. Multiply by 4/3 π: 4/3 * 3.1416 * 3.9e-24 ≈ 16.33e-24 cm³, so 1.633e-23 cm³ per molecule.

Wait, but wait, in a liquid, the molecules are in contact, so the volume each takes up in the liquid would be considering their close packing. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to calculate the volume each molecule occupies based on the hard-sphere model, and then compare it to the actual volume each molecule has in the liquid.

Wait, the idea is to calculate the volume each molecule "takes up" in the liquid, which would be the volume per molecule in the liquid (Vm / NA) divided by the volume per molecule in a close-packed arrangement.

Wait no, the fraction of empty space is 1 minus the packing fraction. The packing fraction is the volume occupied by the molecules divided by the total volume. So if molecules are packed in a way that each takes up their own volume, the rest is empty.

So in the hard-sphere model, the maximum packing is about 0.74 (for FCC or HCP), but in reality, liquids are less densely packed. For a liquid, the packing fraction is lower, so the empty space is higher.

Wait, but the question is, given the liquid's density, what fraction is empty space, assuming the molecules are hard spheres with the given diameter.

So the plan is:

1. Calculate the volume per molecule in the liquid (V_liq).
2. Calculate the volume each molecule would occupy in a close-packed arrangement (V_close), which is the volume of the sphere (since in close packing, each molecule touches its neighbors).
3. The packing fraction is V_close / V_liq.
4. The empty space fraction is 1 minus the packing fraction.

Wait, actually, no. Because in the close-packing, each sphere's volume is the same as the molecule's volume, but in the liquid, the molecules are more loosely packed. So the packing fraction is (molecular volume) / (volume per molecule in liquid).

Wait, I think I'm getting it backwards. Let me think again.

The volume per molecule in the liquid is V_liq = Vm / NA.

The molecular volume (V_molecule) is the volume of a sphere, which is (4/3)πr³.

So the packing fraction (the fraction of space occupied by the molecules) is V_molecule / V_liq.

So the empty space fraction is 1 - (V_molecule / V_liq).

Wait, no, wait. Wait, imagine that in the liquid, each molecule is surrounded by others, but perhaps not as tightly packed as in the solid. So the V_liq is the actual volume each molecule is taking up in the liquid (including the space between them). The V_molecule is just the volume of the molecule itself. So the ratio V_molecule / V_liq gives the packing fraction (i.e., how much of the liquid's volume is taken up by the molecules) and 1 minus that would be the empty space.

But wait, the problem is that in the liquid, the molecules are moving, so the volume per molecule is larger than the molecular volume, so the packing fraction is smaller than 1.

So, for example, if each molecule in the liquid has a volume per molecule V_liq, which includes empty space, then the packing fraction is V_molecule / V_liq. So the fraction of empty space is 1 - (V_molecule / V_liq).

Wait, that makes sense. Because if the molecules are packed closely, V_liq approaches V_molecule, so the empty space approaches zero. But in reality, V_liq is larger, so V_molecule / V_liq is less than 1, giving some empty fraction.

So let's compute that.

First, let's compute V_liq, the volume per molecule in the liquid.

Vm = 28 / 0.8081 = 34.67 cm³/mol.

Vm per molecule is 34.67 cm³/mol / 6.022e23 molecules/mol = 34.67 / 6.022e23 ≈ 5.76e-23 cm³/molecule.

Now, the volume of a single N2 molecule (as a sphere) is (4/3)πr³.

Diameter d = 3.15e-8 cm → radius r = 1.575e-8 cm.

Compute r³: (1.575e-8)^3 = (approx) let me compute 1.575^3 = approx 3.903, so 3.903e-24 cm³.

Multiply by 4/3 π: 4.1888 * 3.903e-24 ≈ 1.633e-23 cm³/molecule.

So V_molecule = 1.633e-23 cm³.

Now, the volume per molecule in the liquid is V_liq = 5.76e-23 cm³.

So the packing fraction is V_molecule / V_liq = 1.633e-23 / 5.76e-23 ≈ 0.2834.

So the fraction occupied is approx 28.34%, so the empty space is 1 - 0.2834 = 0.7166, which is about 71.66%.

Looking at the options, option F is 71.30%, which is close. But let me check my calculations for any mistakes.

Wait, let me recalculate the numbers more accurately.

Compute Vm: 28 / 0.8081.

Let me compute 28 ÷ 0.8081.

0.8081 times 34 is 27.4754 (since 0.8081 *30=24.243, 0.8081*4=3.2324; total 27.4754). 34 gives 27.4754, less than 28. 34.6 times 0.8081: 34 *0.8081=27.4754; 0.6 *0.8081=0.48486; sum to 27.96026. So 34.6 gives 27.96026, which is less than 28. So 34.64 gives 34 *0.8081=27.4754, 0.64 *0.8081=0.517. 27.4754 +0.517=27.9924. Close to 28. So 34.64 cm³/mol.

So Vm = 34.64 cm³/mol.

Vm per molecule is 34.64 / (6.022e23) = 5.759e-23 cm³/molecule.

Molecular volume: (4/3) π (1.575e-8 cm)^3.

Compute 1.575e-8 cm → 1.575^3 = let me compute 1.575 *1.575 = 2.48 approx. 2.48 *1.575 = approx 3.905.

So (1.575e-8)^3 = 3.905e-24 cm³.

Multiply by (4/3)π: 4.18879 *3.905e-24 = 

4 *3.905 = 15.62, 0.18879 *3.905 ≈ 0.736 → total 16.356 → 1.6356e-23 cm³.

So V_molecule is 1.6356e-23 cm³.

So the ratio V_molecule / V_liq = 1.6356e-23 / 5.759e-23 ≈ 0.284.

So the packing fraction is 0.284 → so the empty space is 1 - 0.284 = 0.716 → 71.6%.

Looking at the options, option F is 71.30%, which is very close. But wait, perhaps I made a rounding error. Let me check the exact calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute things more accurately.

Let me recompute Vm:

Vm = 28 / 0.8081 = ?

0.8081 * 34.64 = ?

Compute 34 * 0.8081 = 27.4754.

0.64 *0.8081 = 0.517.

So 34.64 → 27.4754 + 0.517 = 27.9924, which is less than 28 by 0.0076. So perhaps 34.64 + (0.0076 / 0.8081) ≈ 34.64 + 0.0094 = 34.6494 cm³/mol.

But the difference is small; so Vm ≈ 34.64 cm³/mol.

So Vm per molecule = 34.64 / 6.022e23 = let me compute 34.64 / 6.022e23.

34.64 / 6.022 = approximately 5.757 → 5.757e-23 cm³/molecule.

Molecular volume: (4/3)π r³.

r = 3.15e-8 cm / 2 = 1.575e-8 cm.

r³ = (1.575e-8)^3 = 1.575^3 * 1e-24.

1.575^3 = 1.575 * 1.575 = 2.4806; 2.4806 *1.575 ≈ let me compute:

2 *1.575 = 3.15.

0.4806 *1.575 → let's see, 0.4 *1.575=0.63, 0.0806 *1.575≈0.127. So total ≈0.63 +0.127= 0.757. So 2.4806 *1.575≈3.15 +0.757=3.907.

So r³ = 3.907e-24 cm³.

Multiply by (4/3)π: 4.18879 *3.907e-24 = let's calculate 3.907 *4.18879.

3 *4.18879=12.56637.

0.907 *4.18879≈ approximately 3.803.

So total ≈12.56637 +3.803=16.36937e-24 cm³.

So V_molecule = 1.63697e-23 cm³.

So V_molecule / V_liq = 1.63697e-23 /5.757e-23 ≈ 0.2845.

So packing fraction is ≈28.45%.

Thus, empty space is 1 - 0.2845 = 0.7155 → 71.55%.

Looking at the options, F is 71.30%, which is the closest. But wait, perhaps I should be more precise.

Wait, perhaps the calculation of the van der Waals diameter is intended to be used differently. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the number of molecules in a given volume and see how much space they take.

Another approach: Let's compute the volume per mole, then per molecule, and then compute how much space each molecule would occupy in a close-packed structure.

Wait, another way to think about it is to compute the packing density as (n * (molecular volume)) / (Vm), where n is Avogadro's number.

Wait, the packing density η is the ratio of the volume occupied by the molecules to the molar volume.

So η = (N_A * (4/3 π r³)) / Vm.

So η = (6.022e23 molecules/mol) * (4/3 π (1.575e-8 cm)^3) / (34.64 cm³/mol).

Let me compute the numerator: 6.022e23 * 1.63697e-23 cm³.

6.022e23 *1.63697e-23 = 6.022 *1.63697 ≈ 9.85 cm³/mol.

So η = 9.85 cm³/mol / 34.64 cm³/mol = approx 0.284.

So the packing density is 28.4%, so the empty space is 71.6%, which is about option F (71.30%).

Wait, but perhaps the exact calculation would give a more precise value. Let me compute it more accurately.

Compute r³: 1.575e-8 cm.

1.575^3 = ?

1.575 * 1.575 = 2.480625.

2.480625 * 1.575 = let me compute:

2 * 1.575 = 3.15.

0.480625 * 1.575:

Compute 0.4 *1.575=0.63.

0.080625 *1.575 = approx 0.127.

So 0.63 + 0.127 = 0.757.

So 2.480625 * 1.575 = 3.15 + 0.757 = 3.907 cm³.

So (4/3) π r³ = 4.18879 *3.907e-24 = 1.63697e-23 cm³.

Now, Vm is 28 / 0.8081 = let's compute precisely.

0.8081 *34 = 27.4754.

34 *0.8081 = 27.4754.

28 -27.4754= 0.5246.

0.5246 / 0.8081 = approx 0.5246/0.8081 ≈ 0.6494.

So Vm is 34.6494 cm³/mol.

So per molecule volume is 34.6494 /6.022e23 = 34.6494 /6.022e23 = 5.757e-23 cm³/molecule.

So η = 1.63697e-23 /5.757e-23 = approx 0.2845.

So 1 - η = 0.7155 → 71.55%. So the closest option is F:71.30%, but wait, perhaps the given options are not exact. Let me see the options again.

Options:
F:71.30%
J:60.00%

Hmm, 71.55% is closest to F, which is 71.30%. So the answer should be F.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, I got 71.55%, but option F is 71.30%. Close enough for the options given.

So I think the correct answer is F.

To determine the fraction of empty space in liquid nitrogen using the hard-sphere model, the following steps were taken:

1. **Calculate the molar volume of liquid nitrogen**:  
   The molar mass of nitrogen (N₂) is 28 g/mol, and the density of liquid nitrogen is 0.8081 g/cm³. The molar volume is given by:  
   \[
   V_m = \frac{\text{Molar Mass}}{\text{Density}} = \frac{28}{0.8081} \approx 34.64 \, \text{cm}^3/\text{mol}.
   \]

2. **Calculate the volume per molecule in the liquid**:  
   Using Avogadro's number (\(N_A = 6.022 \times 10^{23}\) molecules/mol), the volume per molecule is:  
   \[
   V_{\text{liq}} = \frac{V_m}{N_A} = \frac{34.64}{6.022 \times 10^{23}} \approx 5.757 \times 10^{-23
