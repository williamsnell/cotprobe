Okay, so I've got this question about gonorrhea, and I need to figure out which of the options are true. I'm a bit rusty on my STD knowledge, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

First, what do I remember about gonorrhea? It's a sexually transmitted infection, right? Caused by a bacterium, I think. Oh wait, Neisseria gonorrhoeae is the bacteria, if I remember correctly.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Always causes severe pain and discomfort. Hmm, I don't think so. I remember that some STIs can be asymptomatic, meaning they don't show symptoms. So maybe not everyone with gonorrhea has severe pain. So A is probably false.

Option B: Can be treated with antibiotics. Yes, since it's a bacterial infection, antibiotics should work. So B is likely true.

Option C: Can be completely prevented with condoms. I know condoms reduce the risk, but they aren't 100% effective. So maybe C is false because it says 'completely prevented' which might not be accurate.

Option D: Only affects men. No, that's wrong. Gonorrhea affects both men and women, though symptoms might differ. So D is false.

Option E: Infections limited to genital areas. Wait, no. I think gonorrhea can infect other parts like the throat or rectum, especially during oral or anal sex. So E is false.

Option F: Is a viral infection. No, it's bacterial. So F is false.

Option G: Is a form of herpes. No, herpes is a different virus (HSV). So G is false.

Option H: Is asymptomatic in only a small percentage. Wait, I thought a significant number of people, especially women, can have gonorrhea without symptoms. So H says only a small percentage, which would be incorrect. So H is false.

Option I: Can be cured with over-the-counter meds. No, I don't think so. Gonorrhea requires prescription antibiotics, so I is false.

So, reviewing the options, the only true statement is B.

The correct answer is B: can be treated with antibiotics.
