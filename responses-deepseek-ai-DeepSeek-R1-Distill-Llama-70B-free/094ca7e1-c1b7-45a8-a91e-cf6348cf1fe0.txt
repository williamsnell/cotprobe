Okay, so I need to find the pH of a 0.3 M acetic acid solution. Hmm, I remember that acetic acid is a weak acid, so it doesn't completely dissociate in water. The problem gives me the Ka value, which is 1.8 × 10^-5. Right, Ka is the acid dissociation constant.

I think the first step is to write the dissociation equation. Acetic acid (CH3COOH) dissociates into CH3COO^- and H+ ions. So the equation is:

CH3COOH ⇌ CH3COO^- + H+

Since it's a weak acid, I can use the approximation method here. Because the concentration is not super low, I might have to consider if the 5% rule applies, but maybe for this problem, the approximation works.

Let me set up the ICE table. Initial concentrations: CH3COOH is 0.3 M, and both CH3COO^- and H+ are 0.

Change: CH3COOH decreases by x, and both ions increase by x. So at equilibrium, CH3COOH is 0.3 - x, and the ions are x each.

The Ka expression is Ka = [CH3COO^-][H+] / [CH3COOH]. Plugging in the values, that's (x)(x)/(0.3 - x) = 1.8e-5.

So the equation becomes x² / (0.3 - x) = 1.8e-5. Hmm, solving for x. Since Ka is small, x should be much smaller than 0.3, so I can approximate 0.3 - x ≈ 0.3. That simplifies the equation to x² / 0.3 ≈ 1.8e-5.

Calculating x²: 1.8e-5 * 0.3 = 5.4e-6. So x is the square root of 5.4e-6. Let me compute that. Square root of 5.4 is about 2.324, so square root of 5.4e-6 is 2.324e-3. So x ≈ 0.002324 M.

So [H+] is 0.002324 M. To find pH, I take the negative log of that. Let me calculate log(0.002324).

Wait, 0.002324 is 2.324e-3. Log(2.324) is about 0.366. So log(2.324e-3) is 0.366 -3 = -2.634. So pH is the negative of that, which is 2.634.

Looking at the options, let me see. Option B is 2.63. Option F is 2.35, not close. Option C is 2.87, which is higher. So 2.63 is option B.

Wait, but wait a second. I approximated x << 0.3. Let me check if that's valid. My x was about 0.0023, which is 0.23% of 0.3. That's way less than 5%, so the approximation is valid. So my initial approach is correct.

So the pH should be approximately 2.63, which is option B.

To determine the pH of a 0.3 M acetic acid solution, we start by recognizing that acetic acid is a weak acid with a given \( K_a = 1.8 \times 10^{-5} \). The dissociation of acetic acid can be represented as:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COOH} \leftrightharpoons \text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}^+
\]

Using an ICE table, the equilibrium concentrations are:
- \([\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = 0.3 - x\),
- \([\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = x\),
- \([\text{H}^+] = x\).

The \( K_a \) expression is:

\[
K_a = \frac{[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-][\text{H}^+]}{[\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}]} = \frac{x^2}{0.3 - x}.
\]

Since \( K_a \) is small, we approximate \( 0.3 - x \approx 0.3 \), simplifying to:

\[
\frac{x^2}{0.3} = 1.8 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

Solving for \( x^2 \):

\[
x^2 = (1.8 \times 10^{-5})(0.3) = 5.4 \times 10^{-6}.
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
x = \sqrt{5.4 \times 10^{-6}} \approx 0.002324 \, \text{M}.
\]

Thus, \([\text{H}^+] = 0.002324 \, \text{M}\). The pH is calculated as:

\[
\text{pH} = -\log{[\text{H}^+]} = -\log{(0.002324)}.
\]

Breaking it down:
\[
\log{(0.002324)} = \log{(2.324 \times 10^{-3})} = \log{(2.324)} + \log{(10^{-3})} = 0.366 - 3 = -2.634.
\]

Therefore, \(\text{pH} = 2.634\), which rounds to 2.63. Among the given options, the closest match is **B: 2.63**.
