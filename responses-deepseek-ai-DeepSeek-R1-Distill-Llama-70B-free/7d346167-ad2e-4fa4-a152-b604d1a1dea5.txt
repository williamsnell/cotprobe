Okay, so I have this problem about radioactive decay, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The question says that 2.000 picograms (pg) of ^33P decay by beta emission to 0.250 pg in 75.9 days. I need to find the half-life of ^33P. The options are from A to J, all different days. 

Hmm, I remember that radioactive decay follows an exponential model, and the half-life is the time it takes for half of the substance to decay. The formula that comes to mind is the decay formula: N(t) = N0 * (1/2)^(t / t_half). Where N(t) is the remaining quantity, N0 is the initial quantity, t is time, and t_half is the half-life.

So in this problem, the initial quantity N0 is 2.000 pg, and after time t=75.9 days, the remaining quantity N(t) is 0.250 pg. I need to find t_half.

Let me plug these values into the formula. 

0.250 pg = 2.000 pg * (1/2)^(75.9 / t_half)

Wait, I can simplify this. Let me divide both sides by 2.000 pg to get:

0.250 / 2.000 = (1/2)^(75.9 / t_half)

Calculating the left side: 0.250 / 2.000 is 0.125. So,

0.125 = (1/2)^(75.9 / t_half)

Hmm, 0.125 is the same as (1/2)^3, because 1/2 cubed is 1/8 which is 0.125. So,

(1/2)^3 = (1/2)^(75.9 / t_half)

Since the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal. So,

3 = 75.9 / t_half

Now, solving for t_half: t_half = 75.9 / 3

Let me do that division. 75.9 divided by 3. Well, 3 times 25 is 75, so 75.9 divided by 3 is 25.3. 

Wait, so the half-life is 25.3 days. Let me look at the options: Option A is 25.3 days. So the answer should be A.

But wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

Starting again: N(t) = N0 * (1/2)^(t/t_half)
0.250 = 2.000 * (1/2)^(75.9 / t_half)
Divide both sides by 2: 0.125 = (1/2)^(75.9/t_half)
Take log base 1/2: log_{1/2}(0.125) = 75.9 / t_half
Since 0.125 is (1/2)^3, log is 3, so 3 = 75.9 / t_half
t_half = 75.9 /3 =25.3. 

Yes, that seems correct. So the half-life is 25.3 days, which is option A.

To determine the half-life of ^33P, we use the exponential decay formula:

\[
N(t) = N_0 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\frac{t}{t_{\text{half}}}}
\]

Here:
- \(N_0 = 2.000 \, \text{pg}\) (initial quantity),
- \(N(t) = 0.250 \, \text{pg}\) (remaining quantity after 75.9 days),
- \(t = 75.9 \, \text{days}\),
- \(t_{\text{half}}\) is the half-life (to be determined).

Substituting the values:

\[
0.250 = 2.000 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\frac{75.9}{t_{\text{half}}}}
\]

Divide both sides by 2.000:

\[
0.125 = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\frac{75.9}{t_{\text{half}}}}
\]

Recognize that \(0.125 = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3\), so:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\frac{75.9}{t_{\text{half}}}}
\]

Since the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal:

\[
3 = \frac{75.9}{t_{\text{half}}}
\]

Solve for \(t_{\text{half}}\):

\[
t_{\text{half}} = \frac{75.9}{3} = 25.3 \, \text{days}
\]

Thus, the half-life of ^33P is **25.3 days**, which corresponds to option **A**.
