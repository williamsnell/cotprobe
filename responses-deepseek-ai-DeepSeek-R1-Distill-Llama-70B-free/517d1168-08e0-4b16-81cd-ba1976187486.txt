Okay, so I've got this question here about Mary and Pam's test scores and percentiles. Hmm, I remember that percentiles are a way to compare scores relative to others. Let me think about what each percentile means.

Mary is at the 64th percentile. That means she scored better than 64% of the test-takers, right? So 64% scored lower than her, and the remaining 36% scored higher or equal. Wait, no, wait. Actually, percentile ranks can sometimes be a bit tricky. Oh right, if you're in the 64th percentile, 64% scored at or below you, and 36% scored above you. Or is it that 64% scored lower? I think it's that 64% are at or below, so 36% are above. Or wait, no, maybe it's that 64% scored lower, which would mean that 36% scored higher. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Similarly, Pam is at the 56th percentile. So that would mean 56% scored lower than her, right? So 44% scored higher than her. Or is it the other way around? I think percentiles work such that if you're in the pth percentile, p% of people scored less than or equal to you. So Mary's 64th percentile: 64% scored less than or equal, meaning 36% scored higher. Pam's 56th: 56% scored less than or equal, so 44% scored higher.

Now, looking at the options.

Option A: 36% of the test takers scored lower than Pam. Wait, Pam is at 56th percentile. So 56% scored less than or equal. So people scoring lower would be 56%, not 36. So 56% scored less than or equal, meaning 44% scored higher. So A is incorrect because it says 36% scored lower than Pam, which doesn't align.

Option B: Eight percent of those who took the test scored between Pam and Mary. Hmm, how does that work? So the percentage between them would be the difference in their percentiles. Mary is 64, Pam is 56, so the difference is 8%. So does that mean 8% scored between them? Wait, no. Because percentile ranks can be a bit tricky. Let me think: the number of people who scored between Pam and Mary would be the difference in their percentiles. So 64 minus 56 is 8. So 8% of the test takers are between them. So option B says 8% scored between Pam and Mary. That sounds correct. So B could be a possible answer.

Option C: Mary scored 64% of the total points and Pam 56%. Wait, percentiles don't directly translate to percentages of total points unless the test is scaled that way. So I don't think we can assume that. So C is incorrect.

Option D: Mary scored eight more points than Pam. Well, without knowing the total points possible, we can't say. Percentiles relate to relative standing, not the actual points. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Mary's score is 8% higher than Pam's. Again, percentiles don't directly equate to percentage points. They're about relative performance, not actual points, so E is incorrect.

Option F: Mary scored 64 points and Pam 56. But unless the test is out of 100, we can't assume this. So F is incorrect.

Option G: 56 people scored lower than Mary. Wait, the question doesn't give the total number of test takers. So we can't determine exact numbers. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Mary and Pam are in the top 64th and 56th percent of all students. Wait, the 64th percentile means Mary is better than 64% of test takers, so she's in the top 36% (since 100-64=36). Pam is in the top 44% (100-56=44). So H says they're in the top 64th and 56th percent, which is not correct. Because the top percentiles are 100 downwards, so 64th percentile is actually the 36th percentile from the top. So H is incorrect.

Option I: 36 people scored higher than both Mary and Pam. Again, without knowing the total number of test takers, we can't determine exact people. So I is incorrect.

Option J: Eight people scored higher than Mary and Pam. Again, no data on total people, so J is incorrect.

So the only correct option is B: Eight percent of those who took the test scored between Pam and Mary.

On the test, Mary scored at the 64th percentile, meaning 64% of test takers scored at or below her level, and 36% scored higher. Pam scored at the 56th percentile, meaning 56% scored at or below her level, and 44% scored higher. The difference between their percentiles is 8%, which represents the percentage of test takers who scored between Pam and Mary.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. Pam is at the 56th percentile, so 56% scored at or below her, not 36%.  
- **B**: Correct. The 8% difference between Mary's and Pam's percentiles represents the percentage of test takers who scored between them.  
- **C**: Incorrect. Percentiles do not directly translate to percentages of total points unless explicitly stated.  
- **D**: Incorrect. Percentiles reflect relative performance, not actual points, so we cannot determine the point difference.  
- **E**: Incorrect. Percentiles do not equate to percentage increases in scores.  
- **F**: Incorrect. The test's total points are unknown, so we cannot assume specific point values.  
- **G**: Incorrect. The total number of test takers is not provided, so exact numbers cannot be determined.  
- **H**: Incorrect. The 64th percentile means Mary is in the top 36%, and the 56th percentile means Pam is in the top 44%.  
- **I**: Incorrect. The total number of test takers is unknown, so exact numbers cannot be determined.  
- **J**: Incorrect. The total number of test takers is unknown, so exact numbers cannot be determined.  

The correct answer is **B**.  

B
