Okay, I need to solve this problem about a sine wave cycle. Let's start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about a 25-cycle-current sine wave. So, it's an alternating current that completes 25 cycles per second. I remember that the frequency (f) is 25 Hz here. 

The rms value is 30 amps. Oh wait, rms stands for root mean square. For a sine wave, the relationship between the peak value (Im) and the rms (Irms) is Irms = Im / sqrt(2). So if Irms is 30, then the peak current Im should be 30 * sqrt(2). Let me calculate that. Sqrt(2) is approximately 1.414, so 30 * 1.414 is about 42.42 amps. So the peak current is around 42.4 A. That helps in forming the equation.

Now, the general equation for a sine wave is i = Im sin(ωt + φ), where ω is the angular frequency, t is time, and φ is the phase shift. The problem says the wave crosses the time axis in a positive direction at t=0. For a sine function, when t=0, sin(0) is 0, but if it's starting at a positive peak, maybe it's a cosine function instead. Wait, no. Wait, the sine wave crosses zero going positive at t=0. That means it's in phase with sin(ωt), because sin(0) is 0, and the first positive slope starts there. So maybe the equation is a sine function, not cosine. Hmm, but I need to think again. Because a sine wave starts at zero, goes up, while a cosine starts at the peak. Since the wave crosses the axis in positive direction at t=0, that's like starting at zero and going up, which is sine. So the equation would be i = Im sin(ωt).

Wait, no. Wait, when t=0, sin(0) is 0. So the current is zero. But if the wave is crossing the axis in the positive direction at t=0, that makes sense for sine because it's starting to increase. So the equation starts at zero, goes up. So the correct function is sine with no phase shift.

Next, angular frequency ω is 2π times the frequency. Frequency f is 25 Hz, so ω = 2π * 25 = 50π radians per second. Wait, wait, no. Wait, 25 cycles per second. So one cycle is 1/25 seconds. So the period T is 1/25 s. So ω = 2π / T = 2π * 25 = 50π rad/s. So the equation is i = 42.4 sin(50π t). Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 50π. Let me check the options.

Looking through the options, I see options with 157, 314, 100, etc. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating ω. Let me recalculate. Oh wait, 25 Hz is 25 cycles per second, so one cycle is T=1/25 = 0.04 seconds. So angular frequency ω is 2πf, which is 2π*25 = 50π rad/s. 50π is about 157.08 rad/s. Wait, 50 * 3.1416 is approximately 157.08, right? So 50π is approximately 157, so ω is 157 rad/s.

Wait, but 50π is exactly 157.0796... So in the options, I see 157t in some. So the equation would be i = 42.4 sin(157t). 

So putting it together, the equation is i=42.4 sin(157t), and the rms is 30 A. So looking at the options, let's see.

Option D says i=42.4 sin 157t, 30 amp, 1/8 cycle.

Option E is cosine, 30 amp, etc. So our equation is sine, so E is out.

So that's the first part. Now, the next part is the value of the current when time is 0.005 seconds.

So I need to calculate i at t=0.005s.

i = 42.4 sin(157 * 0.005). Let's compute 157 *0.005. 157 *5 = 785, so 157 *0.005 is 0.785 radians.

What's the sine of 0.785 radians? 0.785 is approximately π/4 radians, which is 45 degrees. Sin(45) is sqrt(2)/2 ≈ 0.7071. So 42.4 * 0.7071 ≈ 30 A. Wait, that's the rms value. Interesting. So at t=0.005s, the current is 30 A.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. So 0.005 seconds is the time. Let me compute how much of a cycle that is. The period is T=0.04s, as T=1/f=1/25=0.04s.

So 0.005s / 0.04s per cycle = (0.005)/(0.04) = 0.125 cycles. Which is 1/8 of a cycle. So the fraction is 1/8.

Wait, but the options say for D, the fraction is 1/8 cycle. So that fits.

Wait, but I thought the current is 30 A, which is the rms value. But in the equation, the peak is 42.4 A. So at 45 degrees, sin is 0.707, so 42.4 * 0.7071 ≈30 A. So that's correct.

So the current is 30 A at t=0.005s.

Wait, but the problem states the rms is 30 A. So perhaps the options might have that as the current value? Let me look.

Option D: i=42.4 sin 157t, 30 amp, fraction 1/8 cycle.

So yes, the current is 30 A, fraction 1/8.

So putting it all together, the equation is 42.4 sin 157t, the current at 0.005s is 30 A, and the fraction is 1/8 cycle.

Looking at the options, option D matches this.

Wait, any other options? Let me check.

Option D: i=42.4 sin 157t, 30 amp, 1/8 cycle.

Yes.

Other options: option E is cos and 30, but we have sine. Option A has 314t, which would be for 50 Hz, because 2pi*50=314.

Wait, 25 Hz would be 50pi, which is around 157, as we saw. So option D has 157t, which is correct.

So the correct answer should be D.

To determine the equation of the 25-cycle-current sine wave, we start by noting that the frequency \( f \) is 25 Hz. The angular frequency \( \omega \) is calculated as:

\[
\omega = 2\pi f = 2\pi \cdot 25 = 50\pi \, \text{rad/s} \approx 157.08 \, \text{rad/s}.
\]

The root mean square (rms) value of the current is given as 30 A. For a sine wave, the relationship between the rms value (\( I_{\text{rms}} \)) and the peak value (\( I_m \)) is:

\[
I_{\text{rms}} = \frac{I_m}{\sqrt{2}} \implies I_m = I_{\text{rms}} \cdot \sqrt{2} = 30 \cdot \sqrt{2} \approx 42.4 \, \text{A}.
\]

Thus, the equation of the sine wave is:

\[
i = 42.4 \sin(157t).
\]

Next, we calculate the current at \( t = 0.005 \, \text{s} \). Substituting \( t = 0.005 \) into the equation:

\[
i = 42.4 \sin(157 \cdot 0.005) = 42.4 \sin(0.785).
\]

The angle \( 0.785 \, \text{rad} \) is approximately \( \pi/4 \), and \( \sin(\pi/4) = \sqrt{2}/2 \approx 0.7071 \). Therefore:

\[
i = 42.4 \cdot 0.7071 \approx 30 \, \text{A}.
\]

This matches the rms value, as expected.

Finally, to determine the fraction of a cycle completed in \( t = 0.005 \, \text{s} \), we calculate the period \( T \) of the wave:

\[
T = \frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{25} = 0.04 \, \text{s}.
\]

The fraction of the cycle completed is:

\[
\text{Fraction} = \frac{t}{T} = \frac{0.005}{0.04} = 0.125 = \frac{1}{8}.
\]

Thus, the wave has gone through \( \frac{1}{8} \) of a cycle in \( 0.005 \, \text{s} \).

From the given options, the correct choice is:

\[
\text{D: } i = 42.4 \sin(157t), \, 30 \, \text{A}, \, \frac{1}{8} \, \text{cycle}.
\]
