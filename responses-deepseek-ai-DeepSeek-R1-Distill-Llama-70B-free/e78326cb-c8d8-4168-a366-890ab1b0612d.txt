Okay, so I've got this question here about transforming the total number of errors on a test to percent correct, or vice versa. Hmm, I need to figure out what type of transformation that is. The options are A through J, each representing a different kind of transformation.

Let me start by understanding the question. If I have the total number of errors, and I want to convert that into percent correct, how does that work? Let's say the test has, I don't know, 20 questions. If someone got 5 wrong, then the number of correct answers would be 15. To get the percentage correct, I'd do (15/20)*100, which is 75%.

Wait, but the question is about the type of transformation when converting between the two. So, if I have the total errors, E, and the total items, N, then percent correct P would be ((N - E)/N)*100. Alternatively, E = N - (P/100)*N.

Let me think about the relationship between E and P. If I plot E against P, what does that look like? Let's say N is a constant. For every increase in E, P decreases. Specifically, since P = (N-E)/N *100, that can be rewritten as P = (100/N)(N - E) => P = 100 - (100/N)E. So it's a linear equation because it's in the form y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.

Wait, but if E is on the x-axis and P on the y-axis, then yes, the equation is linear. So the transformation from E to P is a linear transformation.

Let me think about the options. Option I is Linear. So that would be the answer. But wait, are there any other possibilities? Let's check other options.

Option G is Nonlinear. But in this case, the relationship is linear, so G isn't correct. Exponential (A) would be something like y = a^x, which isn't the case here. Sinusoidal (B) involves sine or cosine functionsâ€”nope. Polynomial (C) could be quadratic (option D is Quadratic), but our equation is first-degree, so it's linear, not quadratic. Rational (E) would involve ratios, but I'm not sure that's applicable here. Cumulative (F) doesn't quite fit. Logarithmic (H) is when the relationship is log-based, which isn't the case here. Curvilinear (J) refers to a curve that's not a straight line, but our case is a straight line.

So yes, the correct answer should be I: Linear.

When converting the total number of errors on a test to percent correct (or vice versa), the relationship can be described by a linear equation. For example, if the total number of items is \( N \), the percent correct \( P \) can be expressed as:

\[
P = 100 - \left(\frac{100}{N}\right)E
\]

where \( E \) is the total number of errors. This equation is in the form \( y = mx + b \), which is characteristic of a linear relationship. Therefore, the transformation between the total number of errors and percent correct is linear.

Among the given options, the correct answer is:

I: Linear
