Okay, so I've got this problem about an amplifier and some noise stuff. Hmm, I remember that amplifiers can affect both the signal and the noise. Let me think step by step.

The question says the amplifier has a power gain of 20 dB. Oh right, dB here is decibels, which relates to the power ratio. So 20 dB gain means the output power is 10^(20/10) times the input. Because power gain in dB is 10*log(P_out/P_in), so solving for P_out/P_in is 10^(20/10) = 10^2 = 100. So the gain is 100 times.

The input has a signal power of 100 μW and noise power of 1 μW. So the input signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) is 100/1 = 100. That makes sense because S/N is usually the signal divided by noise.

Wait, but then the amplifier adds its own noise. It contributes an additional 100 μW of noise. Oh right, so the total noise at the output will be the amplified input noise plus the amplifier's noise.

Let me break it down. The input noise is 1 μW. The amplifier's gain is 100, so the output noise from the input would be 1 μW * 100 = 100 μW. Plus the added noise from the amplifier, which is another 100 μW. So total output noise is 100 + 100 = 200 μW.

The output signal is the input signal multiplied by the gain. Input signal is 100 μW * 100 = 10,000 μW, which is 10 mW or 10^4 μW.

So the output S/N ratio is (10,000 μW) / (200 μW) = 50. So part (a) is 50. Let me double-check that. Input S/N is 100. After gain, the signal becomes 100*100=10000 μW, and the noise becomes 1*100 +100=200 μW. So 10000 /200 is 50. Yep, that makes sense.

Now part (b) is the noise factor. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. The noise factor F is defined as (S_in/N_in) / (S_out/N_out). So that's the input S/N divided by the output S/N. Input S/N is 100, output is 50. So F = 100/50 = 2. Oh wait, but sometimes noise factor is also defined as (total noise out)/(noise out from input alone). Let me think.

Alternatively, F is the ratio of (signal-to-noise ratio at input) to (signal-to-noise ratio at output). So yes, F = (S_in/N_in) / (S_out/N_out) = 100/50 = 2. So noise factor is 2.

And part (c) is the noise figure, which is just the noise factor expressed in dB. So noise figure NF = 10 * log10(F). F is 2, so log10(2) is approximately 0.3010. So 10 * 0.3010 = 3.01 dB. So about 3 dB.

Putting it all together: (a) 50, (b) 2, (c) 3 dB.

Looking at the options, option J is Output S/N 50, Noise factor 2, Noise Figure 3dB. So the answer should be J.

The amplifier has a power gain of 20 dB, which corresponds to a power ratio of \(10^{20/10} = 100\). The input signal power is \(100 \, \mu W\) and the input noise power is \(1 \, \mu W\), giving an input signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of \(100/1 = 100\).

The output signal is the input signal multiplied by the gain:  
\[
P_{\text{signal, out}} = 100 \, \mu W \times 100 = 10,000 \, \mu W = 10 \, mW.
\]

The output noise is the sum of the amplified input noise and the additional noise contributed by the amplifier. The input noise is amplified by the gain:  
\[
P_{\text{noise, amplified}} = 1 \, \mu W \times 100 = 100 \, \mu W.
\]

Adding the amplifier's contribution of \(100 \, \mu W\), the total output noise is:  
\[
P_{\text{noise, out}} = 100 \, \mu W + 100 \, \mu W = 200 \, \mu W.
\]

The output S/N ratio is then:  
\[
\text{Output S/N} = \frac{P_{\text{signal, out}}}{P_{\text{noise, out}}} = \frac{10,000 \, \mu W}{200 \, \mu W} = 50.
\]

The noise factor \(F\) is defined as the ratio of the input S/N to the output S/N:  
\[
F = \frac{\text{Input S/N}}{\text{Output S/N}} = \frac{100}{50} = 2.
\]

The noise figure (NF) is the noise factor expressed in dB:  
\[
\text{NF} = 10 \log_{10}(F) = 10 \log_{10}(2) \approx 3.01 \, \text{dB}.
\]

Thus, the results are:  
(a) Output S/N ratio: 50,  
(b) Noise factor: 2,  
(c) Noise figure: 3 dB.

From the given options, the correct choice is **J**.
