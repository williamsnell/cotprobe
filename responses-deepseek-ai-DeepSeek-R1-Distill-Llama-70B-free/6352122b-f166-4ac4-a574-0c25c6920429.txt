Question:

What is meant by the term ''hypothesis testing''?

Options:

A: Hypothesis testing is the method of confirming the truth of a theory by comparing its predictions with empirical data
B: It involves making predictions about future outcomes based on historical data
C: Hypothesis testing is the process of testing a claim or assertion about a population, based on a sample of data from the population.
D: It is the process of determining the validity of a statistical model
E: It is the process of taking a sample from a population
F: It is the process of making assumptions about a population
G: It is the act of creating a theoretical framework to explain observed phenomena in a population
H: It is the process of calculating the probability of an event occurring within a population
I: It is the process of establishing the cause and effect relationships in a population
J: It is the technique of verifying the consistency of a dataset with another dataset

Alright, so I need to figure out what the term "hypothesis testing" means. Let me think about what I remember from my studies.

Hypothesis testing is a statistical method, right? I remember it's used to make inferences about a population based on sample data. So, the basic idea is that you have a claim or a hypothesis about the population, and you test it using a sample.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's about confirming the truth of a theory by comparing predictions with data. That sounds a bit more like the scientific method in general, not specifically hypothesis testing. Plus, hypothesis testing is more about testing a claim, not necessarily a full theory.

Option B talks about making future predictions based on historical data. That sounds more like forecasting or something. Hypothesis testing isn't primarily about predicting the future, but about testing a current claim.

Option C states it's testing a claim about a population using a sample. Yeah, this rings a bell. Hypothesis testing involves taking a sample from the population to test a hypothesis. So this seems correct.

Option D is about determining the validity of a statistical model. That's more like model validation, which is a different concept, though related.

Option E is just about taking a sample. That's part of hypothesis testing, but not the whole process. It's more than just sampling.

Option F involves making assumptions about a population. That's a part of many statistical methods, including hypothesis testing, but not the definition.

Option G is creating a theoretical framework. That's more like theory development, not testing.

Option H is calculating the probability of an event. That's part of statistics but not the definition of hypothesis testing itself.

Option I is about cause and effect. That's more related to experimental design and correlation vs. causation, not hypothesis testing per se.

Option J is verifying dataset consistency. Maybe like comparing two datasets, but that's not the core of hypothesis testing.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be option C because it directly states that hypothesis testing is about testing a claim using a sample from the population.

The correct answer is C because hypothesis testing involves evaluating a claim about a population using sample data.

Answer: C
