Okay, so I've got this problem here about a spherical ball being quenched in a liquid. I'm a bit rusty on my heat transfer, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The problem states: A spherical ball with a radius of 1 inch is at 800°F. It's suddenly quenched in a pool of liquid maintained at 280°F. I need to estimate the surface temperature after one hour. The convective heat transfer coefficient h is 2 Btu/hr·ft²·°F. The material properties are k=25 Btu/hr·ft·°F, rho=492 lbm/ft³, and Cp=0.11 Btu/(lbm·°F).

Hmm, okay. So it's a transient heat transfer problem. I remember that for such problems, especially when the object is cooled or heated in a surrounding fluid, the lumped capacitance method is often used. But wait, the lumped system method has certain limitations. It's applicable when the Biot number is small, right? Let me recall: Biot number Bi = h*Lc/k, where Lc is the characteristic length.

Wait, for a sphere, the characteristic length Lc is the volume divided by the surface area. The volume of a sphere is (4/3)πr³, and the surface area is 4πr². So Lc = (3r)/2. Or wait, no, correction: Lc = V/A = (4/3 π r³) / (4 π r²) ) = r/3. Oh right, so for a sphere, Lc is r/3.

So let's compute the Biot number. First, I need to convert the radius into feet because all the other units are in feet. Wait, the radius is 1 inch, which is 1/12 feet. So r = 1/12 ft. So Lc = (1/12)/3 = 1/36 ft.

Now Bi = h * Lc / k. Plugging in the numbers: h is 2, Lc is 1/36, k is 25. So Bi = (2 * (1/36)) / 25. Let's calculate that: 2/(36*25) = 2/(900) = 0.002222... So Bi is approximately 0.0022. Since Bi is much less than 0.1, the lumped capacitance method is applicable. Great, so I can proceed with that.

The lumped system formula is (T(t) - T_surrounding)/(T_initial - T_surrounding) = exp(-t/(tau)), where tau is the time constant. The time constant tau is rho * Cp * Lc² / (k). Or wait, I think the formula is (rho * Cp * Lc) / h, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me think again.

Wait, the general formula for the lumped capacitance is T(t) = T_surr + (T_initial - T_surr) * exp(-h*A*t/(rho*V*Cp)). Since A is the surface area and V is the volume, A/V = 1/Lc. So this can be rewritten as exp(-h*t/(rho*Cp*Lc)) ). So tau is (rho * Cp * Lc) / h.

Wait, let me double-check the formula. The characteristic time is tau = (rho * V * Cp) / (h A). Since V/A = Lc, then tau = (rho * Lc * Cp) / h. Yes, that's correct.

So let's compute tau. rho is 492 lbm/ft³, Cp is 0.11 Btu/(lbm·°F), Lc is 1/36 ft, h is 2 Btu/hr·ft²·°F.

Plugging in: tau = (492 * 0.11 * (1/36)) / 2. Let's compute that step by step.

First, 492 * 0.11 = let's see, 492 * 0.1 is 49.2, 492 * 0.01 is 4.92, so total 54.12.

Then, 54.12 * (1/36) = 54.12 /36. Let's see, 36*1.5 is 54, so 54.12 /36 is approximately 1.5033.

Then divide by 2: 1.5033 / 2 ≈ 0.75165 hours. So tau is about 0.75165 hours. 

Now, the time given is one hour. So t/tau = 1 / 0.75165 ≈ 1.3309. So the exponent is -1.3309.

Compute exp(-1.3309). I remember that e^-1 is about 0.3679. e^-1.3 is about 0.2725. Let me calculate it more accurately. Let me think: 1.3309 is approximately ln(4). Because ln(4) is about 1.386. So it's a bit less than that. So e^-1.3309 ≈ 0.264.

So the temperature difference ratio is about 0.264. 

Now, the initial temperature difference is (800 - 280) = 520 °F. The surrounding temperature is 280 °F. So the temperature at time t is T = 280 + 520 * 0.264.

Calculate 520 * 0.264. Let's see: 500 * 0.264 = 132, and 20*0.264=5.28, so total 137.28. So T ≈ 280 + 137.28 = 417.28 °F. 

Looking at the options, option B is 417°F. So the answer should be B.

Wait a moment, but the question asks for the surface temperature. In lumped capacitance, the assumption is that the temperature is uniform within the object, so the surface and center are the same. So yes, that's correct.

So I think the correct answer is B: 417°F.

To estimate the surface temperature of the spherical ball after one hour, we use the lumped capacitance method. This method is valid when the Biot number \( Bi \) is small (\( Bi < 0.1 \)).

### Step 1: Calculate the Biot number
The Biot number is given by:

\[
Bi = \frac{h \cdot L_c}{k}
\]

For a sphere, the characteristic length \( L_c \) is:

\[
L_c = \frac{r}{3}
\]

The radius \( r \) is 1 inch, which is \( \frac{1}{12} \, \text{ft} \). Thus:

\[
L_c = \frac{\frac{1}{12}}{3} = \frac{1}{36} \, \text{ft}
\]

Substituting \( h = 2 \, \text{Btu/hr·ft}^2\text{·°F} \) and \( k = 25 \, \text{Btu/hr·ft·°F} \):

\[
Bi = \frac{2 \cdot \frac{1}{36}}{25} = \frac{2}{900} \approx 0.0022
\]

Since \( Bi < 0.1 \), the lumped capacitance method is applicable.

### Step 2: Calculate the time constant
The time constant \( \tau \) is given by:

\[
\tau = \frac{\rho \cdot C_p \cdot L_c}{h}
\]

Substituting \( \rho = 492 \, \text{lbm/ft}^3 \), \( C_p = 0.11 \, \text{Btu/(lbm·°F)} \), \( L_c = \frac{1}{36} \, \text{ft} \), and \( h = 2 \, \text{Btu/hr·ft}^2\text{·°F} \):

\[
\tau = \frac{492 \cdot 0.11 \cdot \frac{1}{36}}{2}
\]

First, calculate \( 492 \cdot 0.11 \):

\[
492 \cdot 0.11 = 54.12
\]

Then, divide by 36:

\[
\frac{54.12}{36} \approx 1.5033
\]

Finally, divide by 2:

\[
\tau = \frac{1.5033}{2} \approx 0.75165 \, \text{hours}
\]

---

### Step 3: Calculate the temperature
The temperature at time \( t \) is given by:

\[
T(t) = T_{\text{surrounding}} + (T_{\text{initial}} - T_{\text{surrounding}}) \cdot e^{-\frac{t}{\tau}}
\]

Substituting \( T_{\text{surrounding}} = 280 \, \text{°F} \), \( T_{\text{initial}} = 800 \, \text{°F} \), \( t = 1 \, \text{hour} \), and \( \tau = 0.75165 \, \text{hours} \):

\[
\frac{t}{\tau} = \frac{1}{0.75165} \approx 1.3309
\]

The exponential term is:

\[
e^{-1.3309} \approx 0.264
\]

The temperature difference is:

\[
T(t) = 280 + (800 - 280) \cdot 0.264
\]

First, calculate \( 800 - 280 \):

\[
800 - 280 = 520 \, \text{°F}
\]

Then, multiply by 0.264:

\[
520 \cdot 0.264 \approx 137.28 \, \text{°F}
\]

Finally, add 280:

\[
T(t) = 280 + 137.28 \approx 417.28 \, \text{°F}
\]

---

The surface temperature of the ball after one hour is approximately **417°F**, which corresponds to option **B**.
