Okay, so I've got this problem about glacial acetic acid and its melting and boiling points under different pressures. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem has two parts, a) and b). Let's start with part a). So part a) is asking for the melting point at zero atm vapor pressure. The given data is the melting point at 1 atm is 16°C. The heat of fusion is 2700 cal/mole, and molecular weight is 60. The densities of solid and liquid are 1.10 and 1.05 g/cc respectively.

Wait, I remember that when pressure changes, the melting point can change. I think the Clausius-Clapeyron equation is involved here. Right, the equation relates the change in pressure to the change in temperature during a phase transition.

The Clausius-Clapeyron equation is dP/dT = (ΔH_fus / T) * (1 / (V_liq - V_solid)) ), but wait, actually the equation is usually written for vapor-liquid equilibria, but it can be adapted for solid-liquid transitions as well.

Wait, more accurately, for solid-liquid transitions, the equation is dP/dT = (ΔH_fus) / [T (V_liq - V_solid))]. Since the molar volume change is V_liq minus V_solid, and if the density of the liquid is less than the solid, then V_liq is higher, so the denominator is positive.

But wait, in this case, the solid has a higher density than the liquid. So solid density is 1.10 g/cc, liquid is 1.05. So the solid is denser, so when it melts, the volume increases. So (V_liq - V_solid) would be positive because V is inversely related to density. So when the solid melts, it expands, so V increases.

Wait, molar volume is V = (M) / (density * 1 g/cm³ to kg/m³ conversion?), but since the densities are given in g/cm³, maybe we can compute molar volume as M/(density * 10^6 g/m³), but wait, actually, 1 g/cm³ is 1000 kg/m³. Hmm, but for the difference in molar volumes, perhaps the units will cancel out.

Wait, let me think. The molar volume is V = (molecular weight) / (density). Because density is mass/volume, so volume is mass/density. So for a mole, mass is molecular weight in grams. So V (cm³/mol) = (MW g/mol) / (density g/cm³) ) So that would give cm³ per mole. Which is useful because 1 cm³ is 1e-6 m³, but perhaps the units can be kept in cm³ for calculation.

Wait, the heat of fusion is given in cal/mol, which is a bit old-fashioned (since SI uses J now), but I'll proceed.

So for part a), we're changing pressure from 1 atm to 0 atm. Wait, 0 atm? That would be a vacuum. So the pressure drops from 1 atm to 0 (well, maybe it's the vapor pressure at a certain T, but I'm not sure). Wait, the question says the melting point at its vapor pressure of 0 atm. Hmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Oh, perhaps it's the melting point when the pressure is equal to the vapor pressure, which is zero. Wait, that might not make sense. Or perhaps it's the melting point at a pressure where the vapor pressure is zero, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's the melting point when the external pressure is zero, but that's not physically possible. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the question is about the melting point when the pressure is reduced to zero, i.e., from 1 atm to 0 atm. So we're looking for how the melting point changes when the pressure decreases by 1 atm.

So let's proceed under that assumption.

The Clausius-Clapeyron equation for solid-liquid equilibrium is:

dP/dT = (ΔH_fus) / [T (V_liq - V_solid))]

We can rearrange this to find dT when dP is applied.

Assuming that ΔH_fus and the molar volume change are constant over the temperature and pressure ranges considered, which is probably acceptable for small changes.

So, integrating both sides, we get:

ΔT = [ (T * (V_liq - V_solid)) / ΔH_fus ) ] * ΔP

Wait no, let me check the integration. Let me write it properly.

The equation is dP/dT = (ΔH_fus)/(T (V_liq - V_solid)).

Wait, wait, the equation is:

dP/dT = (ΔH_fus) / [ T (V_liq - V_solid) ) ]

So rearranging:

dP = [ΔH_fus / (T (V_liq - V_solid))] dT

Integrate both sides from P1 to P2 and T1 to T2.

So,

P2 - P1 = [ΔH_fus / (V_liq - V_solid)] ∫ (1/T) dT from T1 to T2.

The integral is ln(T2/T1). So,

ΔP = (ΔH_fus / (V_liq - V_solid)) * ln(T2 / T1)

We can solve for T2, the new melting temperature.

Wait, but the equation is:

ΔP = (ΔH_fus / (V_liq - V_solid)) * ln(T2 / T1)

Wait, but in our case, we're going from P1=1 atm to P2=0 atm. So ΔP = -1 atm.

Wait, wait, no. Because the equation is written for dP, so if the pressure decreases, then ΔP is negative. So when P decreases, what happens to T?

Let me get the sign right. The equation is:

dP/dT = (ΔH_fus) / [ T (V_liq - V_solid) ]

Since ΔH_fus is positive (heat is absorbed when melting), and V_liq > V_solid (since density of solid is higher), so (V_liq - V_solid) is positive. So dP/dT is positive. So as T increases, P increases.

Wait, but in this case, we are changing from P=1 atm to P=0 atm, so P is decreasing. So according to dP/dT being positive, T would decrease.

Wait, but let's think again. Suppose we lower the pressure. If the substance contracts upon freezing (i.e., liquid is less dense than solid, so when freezing, volume decreases), then according to Le Chatelier's principle, lowering pressure would favor the phase with larger volume, which is the liquid. So lowering pressure would lower the melting point, because you're making it easier to melt.

Wait, that makes sense. So if you lower the pressure, the melting point would decrease. So from 16°C at 1 atm, when pressure decreases to 0 atm, the melting point should be lower.

But let's proceed with the equation.

We can write:

ΔP = P2 - P1 = 0 atm - 1 atm = -1 atm.

We can rearrange the equation to solve for T2.

So,

ln(T2 / T1) = [ (V_liq - V_solid) * ΔP ) ] / ΔH_fus

Wait, no, let me check:

ΔP = (ΔH_fus / (V_liq - V_solid)) * ln(T2 / T1)

So,

ln(T2 / T1) = [ (ΔP) (V_liq - V_solid) ) ] / ΔH_fus

Wait, no, let me re-express correctly.

Wait, the integrated form is:

ΔP = (ΔH_fus / (V_liq - V_solid)) * ln(T2 / T1)

Wait, so to solve for T2:

ln(T2 / T1) = [ (ΔP) * (V_liq - V_solid) ) ] / (ΔH_fus)

Wait, no, that can't be right because the equation is:

ΔP = (ΔH_fus / (V_liq - V_solid)) * ln(T2 / T1)

So,

ln(T2/T1) = [ΔP (V_liq - V_solid) ] / ΔH_fus 

Wait, but with the correct sign.

Wait, let me make sure. When pressure decreases (ΔP is negative), and since (V_liq - V_solid) is positive, the numerator becomes negative, so ln(T2/T1) is negative, implying T2 < T1, which makes sense because lowering pressure lowers the melting point.

So T2 = T1 * exp( [ΔP (V_liq - V_solid) ] / ΔH_fus )

Now, let's compute V_liq and V_solid.

The molar volume is V = (M) / (density * 1e6 g/m³) ) Wait, no, wait. Let me think.

Density is in g/cm³, so 1 g/cm³ = 1000 kg/m³.

Wait, the molar mass is 60 g/mol. So the molar volume V = (60 g/mol) / (density in g/cm³) ) * (1 cm³/g) ) = (60 / density) cm³/mol.

Wait, because density is g/cm³, so 1/density is cm³/g. Multiply by grams per mole (60 g/mol) gives cm³/mol.

So for the solid:

V_solid = (60 g/mol) / (1.10 g/cm³) = 60 / 1.10 ≈ 54.545 cm³/mol.

For the liquid:

V_liq = 60 / 1.05 ≈ 57.143 cm³/mol.

So (V_liq - V_solid) = 57.143 - 54.545 ≈ 2.598 cm³/mol.

Now, converting cm³ to m³: 1 cm³ = 1e-6 m³, so 2.598 cm³ = 2.598e-6 m³.

But wait, the units of ΔH_fus are cal/mol. Let me check the units in the equation.

The equation is:

ΔP (in Pascals) = (ΔH_fus (in J/mol)) / [T (in K) * (V_liq - V_solid in m³/mol) ) ] * ln(T2/T1)

Wait, but in our case, we have ΔH_fus in cal/mol, so we need to convert it to J/mol. 1 cal is approximately 4.184 J, so 2700 cal/mol = 2700 * 4.184 ≈ 11276 J/mol.

But wait, in the equation, we have ΔH_fus in J/mol, V in m³/mol, T in K, and ΔP in Pascals.

But in our case, ΔP is in atm. Let's see, 1 atm is 101325 Pascals. So ΔP is -1 atm, which is -101325 Pa.

So putting it all together.

Compute (V_liq - V_solid) = 2.598 cm³/mol = 2.598e-6 m³/mol.

ΔH_fus = 2700 cal/mol = 2700 * 4.184 ≈ 11276 J/mol.

T1 is 16°C = 289.15 K.

So,

ln(T2/T1) = [ (ΔP) * (V_liq - V_solid) ) ] / (ΔH_fus)

Plugging in the numbers:

ΔP = -101325 Pa

V_liq - V_solid = 2.598e-6 m³/mol

ΔH_fus = 11276 J/mol

So,

ln(T2 / T1) = [ (-101325) * (2.598e-6) ) ] / 11276

Calculate numerator:

-101325 * 2.598e-6 = Let's compute 101325 * 2.598e-6

First, 1e-6 is 0.000001, so 101325 * 2.598e-6 = 101325 * 2.598 * 1e-6.

Compute 101325 * 2.598:

Approximate as 100000 * 2.6 = 260,000, but let's compute more accurately.

101325 * 2.598 = ?

Well, 100,000 * 2.598 = 259,800.

1,325 * 2.598: Let's compute 1,000 *2.598=2598, 325*2.598≈844.35. So total ≈2598 + 844.35 = 3442.35.

So total 259800 + 3442.35 = 263,242.35.

Multiply by 1e-6: 263242.35e-6 = 0.26324235.

But since ΔP is negative, this is -0.26324235.

So,

ln(T2/T1) ≈ (-0.26324235) / 11276 ≈ Let me compute that.

Wait, no, wait. The equation is:

ln(T2/T1) = [ (ΔP) * (V_liq - V_solid) ) ] / (ΔH_fus )

So,

ln(T2/T1) = [ (-101325) * (2.598e-6) ) ] / 11276

So,

= (-0.26324235) / 11276 ≈ let me compute that.

Wait, 0.26324235 divided by 11276.

Approximately, 0.26324235 / 11276 ≈ 2.334e-5.

But it's negative, so ln(T2/T1) ≈ -2.334e-5.

Then,

T2/T1 = exp(-2.334e-5) ≈ 1 - 2.334e-5 + (2.334e-5)^2/2 - ... which is approximately 0.99997666.

So T2 ≈ T1 * 0.99997666 ≈ 289.15 K * 0.99997666 ≈ 289.13 K.

Wait, that's only a change of about 0.02 K, which would make the melting point decrease from 16°C to about 15.99°C. But that's a very small change, like 16°C to about 16°C, which doesn't match any of the options given in part a). The options are in the 14-17°C range, so this can't be right. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the sign in the equation. Let's re-examine.

The equation is dP/dT = (ΔH_fus) / [ T (V_liq - V_solid) ]

Assuming that (V_liq - V_solid) is positive, which it is, and ΔH_fus is positive.

So when pressure decreases (ΔP is negative), the equation would cause a decrease in T, so T2 is less than T1.

But according to our calculation, T2 is about 289.13 K, which is 16.0°C (since 273.15 +16=289.15). So 289.13 is about 15.98°C, which is a drop of 0.02°C. That's a very small change, but none of the options are that close. Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation error.

Wait, let me go through the calculations again.

Compute (ΔP) * (V_liq - V_solid) = (-101325) * (2.598e-6) = ?

Let me compute it accurately.

101325 * 2.598e-6:

We can compute it as:

101325 * 2.598 = ?

Let me compute 101325 * 2 = 202,650.

101325 * 0.598 = ?

Compute 101325 * 0.5 = 50,662.5

101325 * 0.098 = Approximately 101325 * 0.1 = 10,132.5, minus 101325*0.002=202.65 → 10,132.5 - 202.65=9,929.85.

So 50,662.5 + 9,929.85 = 60,592.35.

So total 202,650 + 60,592.35 = 263,242.35.

Multiply by 1e-6 → 0.26324235.

So with the negative sign, it's -0.26324235.

Then, divide by ΔH_fus = 11276 J/mol.

So, -0.26324235 / 11276 ≈ -2.334e-5.

So ln(T2/T1) = -2.334e-5.

So T2 = T1 * e^(-2.334e-5).

Compute e^(-2.334e-5) ≈ 1 - 2.334e-5 + (2.334e-5)^2/2.

Which is approximately 0.99997666.

So T2 ≈ 289.15 * 0.99997666 ≈ 289.13 K.

Which is 15.98°C, so about 16°C. But none of the options are that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe I should consider the equation differently. Perhaps the equation is written as:

ln(T2/T1) = (V_liq - V_solid)/(ΔH_fus) * (P2 - P1) / T1

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me re-express the equation correctly.

The correct form after integration is:

ln(T2/T1) = [ (V_liq - V_solid) / ΔH_fus ) * (P2 - P1) ) ]

Wait, that's not matching the units. Let me think again.

Wait, the equation is:

dP/dT = (ΔH_fus) / [ T (V_liq - V_solid) ]

Which can be rewritten as:

dP = [ ΔH_fus / (V_liq - V_solid) ) ] * (dT / T )

Integrate from T1 to T2 and P1 to P2:

P2 - P1 = (ΔH_fus / (V_liq - V_solid)) ∫ (1/T) dT from T1 to T2.

So,

ΔP = (ΔH_fus / (V_liq - V_solid)) * ln(T2 / T1)

So,

ln(T2/T1) = [ (V_liq - V
