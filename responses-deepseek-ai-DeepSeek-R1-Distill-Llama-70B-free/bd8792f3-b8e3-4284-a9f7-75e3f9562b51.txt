Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a charged nonconducting rod. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. Alright, the rod is 2.00 meters long and has a cross-sectional area of 4.00 cm². It's lying along the positive x-axis with one end at the origin. The volume charge density rho is given as -4.00 microcoulombs per cubic meter. I need to find out how many excess electrons are on the rod.

Wait, volume charge density is charge per unit volume. Since it's negative, that means the charge is from electrons, right? Because electrons are negative. So the rod has an excess of electrons.

First, I think I should calculate the total charge on the rod. Oh right, charge is density times volume. So Q = rho * V.

But wait, what's the volume here? The rod's length is 2 meters, and cross-sectional area is 4 cm². Oh, I should convert cm² to m² because the units need to be consistent. 1 cm is 0.01 meters, so 1 cm² is (0.01 m)^2 = 1e-4 m². So 4 cm² is 4 * 1e-4 = 4e-4 m².

Volume V is area multiplied by length. So V = 4e-4 m² * 2 m = 8e-4 m³.

Now, the charge density rho is -4.00 microC/m³. Micro is 1e-6, so rho is -4e-6 C/m³.

So total charge Q = rho * V = (-4e-6 C/m³) * (8e-4 m³) = Let's compute that: 4 *8 is 32, and exponents are 1e-6 *1e-4 = 1e-10. So 32e-10 C, which is -3.2e-9 C.

Wait no, wait, 4e-6 * 8e-4 is (4*8) * 1e-6 *1e-4 = 32e-10, which is 3.2e-9. So Q is -3.2e-9 C.

Wait, but wait, 4 *8 is 32, so 32e-10 is 3.2e-9. Yeah, that's right. So Q is -3.2e-9 coulombs.

But electrons have a charge of -e, where e is 1.6e-19 C. So the number of electrons is the total charge divided by the elementary charge.

So number of electrons N = Q / e. But since Q is negative, that just tells me it's electrons, not protons.

So N = (3.2e-9 C) / (1.6e-19 C per electron) = Let me calculate that.

3.2e-9 / 1.6e-19 = (3.2 /1.6 ) * (1e-9 /1e-19 ) → 2 * 1e10 → 2e10 electrons.

Wait, but wait, wait. The problem says "excess electrons," so the negative charge is because of extra electrons. So the number is 2e10.

Looking at the options, option H is 2.00e10 electrons. So the answer should be H.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Volume: 2 m * 4 cm² → 4 cm² is 4e-4 m². So 2 *4e-4 = 8e-4 m³. Correct.

Charge Q = rho * V = (-4e-6 C/m³) * (8e-4 m³) → (-4 *8) e-10 → -32e-10 → -3.2e-9 C. Correct.

Number of electrons: 3.2e-9 / 1.6e-19 = 2e10. Yes. So the number is 2e10, option H.

To determine the number of excess electrons on the charged nonconducting rod, we start by calculating the total charge \( Q \) on the rod using the formula:

\[
Q = \rho \cdot V
\]

where \( \rho \) is the volume charge density and \( V \) is the volume of the rod. The rod has a length of \( 2.00 \, \mathrm{m} \) and a cross-sectional area of \( 4.00 \, \mathrm{cm}^2 \). Converting the area to square meters:

\[
4.00 \, \mathrm{cm}^2 = 4.00 \times (0.01 \, \mathrm{m})^2 = 4.00 \times 10^{-4} \, \mathrm{m}^2
\]

The volume of the rod is then:

\[
V = \text{length} \cdot \text{area} = 2.00 \, \mathrm{m} \cdot 4.00 \times 10^{-4} \, \mathrm{m}^2 = 8.00 \times 10^{-4} \, \mathrm{m}^3
\]

The volume charge density is given as \( \rho = -4.00 \, \mu\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{m}^3 = -4.00 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{C}/\mathrm{m}^3 \). Substituting these values into the formula for \( Q \):

\[
Q = (-4.00 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{C}/\mathrm{m}^3) \cdot (8.00 \times 10^{-4} \, \mathrm{m}^3) = -3.2 \times 10^{-9} \, \mathrm{C}
\]

The negative sign indicates that the charge is due to excess electrons. To find the number of electrons, we divide the total charge by the charge of a single electron (\( e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{C} \)):

\[
N = \frac{|Q|}{e} = \frac{3.2 \times 10^{-9} \, \mathrm{C}}{1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{C}} = 2.00 \times 10^{10} \, \text{electrons}
\]

Thus, the rod has \( 2.00 \times 10^{10} \) excess electrons. Comparing this result with the provided options, the correct answer is:

**H: \( 2.00 \times 10^{10} \, \text{electrons} \)**

H
