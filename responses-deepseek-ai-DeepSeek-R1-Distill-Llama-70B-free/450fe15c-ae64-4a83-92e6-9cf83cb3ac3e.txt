Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem to solve. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the pH of a 0.15 M H2SO4 solution, and they give K2 as 1.26 × 10^-2. Hmm, right, sulfuric acid is a diprotic acid, so it donates two protons. But wait, the first dissociation is complete, right? Like, H2SO4 is a strong acid for the first proton, so it completely dissociates into H+ and HSO4^-.

So the first step is H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? Wait no, no, wait. Wait, sulfuric acid is diprotic. The first dissociation is complete: H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? No, wait, no. Wait, I might be getting this mixed up. For the first proton, H2SO4 is a strong acid, so it completely dissociates. So H2SO4 → H+ + HSO4^-.

Oh wait, no, wait. No, wait. I think the first dissociation is H2SO4 → 2H+ + SO4^2-? Or is it that the first H+ comes off completely, and the second one is a weak acid? Oh right, right. H2SO4 is a diprotic acid. The first proton (H+) is donated completely, so H2SO4 dissociates 100% into H+ and HSO4^-.

Then, the HSO4^- ion can donate another proton, but that's a weak acid. So the second dissociation is HSO4^- ⇌ H+ + SO4^2-.

So, for the solution, the initial concentration is 0.15 M H2SO4. After the first dissociation, we get 0.15 M H+ from the first H+, and 0.15 M HSO4^-.

Now, the HSO4^- can dissociate further. So the second dissociation is the one we need to consider for the pH. The second ionization constant K2 is given as 1.26e-2.

So, the concentration of H+ from the first dissociation is 0.15 M. Let's call that [H+]1 = 0.15 M.

Then, for the second dissociation, each HSO4^- can donate another H+.

The setup for the second dissociation is:

HSO4^- ⇌ H+ + SO4^2-

The initial concentrations are:
[HSO4^-] = 0.15 M
[H+] = 0.15 M (from first dissociation)
[SO4^2-] = 0.

The change will be:
HSO4^-: -x
H+: +x
SO4^2-: +x

So, at equilibrium:
[HSO4^-] = 0.15 - x
[H+] = 0.15 + x
[SO4^2-] = x

The expression for K2 is:

K2 = [H+][SO4^2-] / [HSO4^-] 

Plugging in the values:

1.26e-2 = (0.15 + x)(x) / (0.15 - x)

Assuming that x is small compared to 0.15, can we approximate (0.15 + x) ≈ 0.15 and (0.15 - x) ≈ 0.15? Wait, let's check if x is small. If K is 1.26e-2, and the initial concentration is 0.15, which is 0.15 M.

Let me compute (0.15)(x) ≈ 0.15 x. So K = (0.15 x) / 0.15 → K = x. So x ≈ K2 = 1.26e-2. Hmm, but 0.0126 is about 8% of 0.15. Wait, that's not too small. So the approximation might not hold. Alternatively, perhaps we can't neglect x, so we need to solve the quadratic equation.

So let's write the equation without approximation:

1.26e-2 = (0.15 + x)(x) / (0.15 - x)

Multiply both sides by (0.15 - x):

1.26e-2 (0.15 - x) = x (0.15 + x)

Expand both sides:

Left side: 1.26e-2 * 0.15 - 1.26e-2 x = 0.00189 - 0.0126 x

Right side: 0.15x + x²

Bring all terms to one side:

0.00189 - 0.0126x = 0.15x + x²

Bring everything to left:

0.00189 -0.0126x -0.15x -x² = 0

Combine like terms:

0.00189 - (0.0126 + 0.15)x - x² = 0

→ 0.00189 - 0.1626 x - x² = 0

Rearranged:

x² + 0.1626 x - 0.00189 = 0

This is a quadratic equation in the form ax² + bx + c = 0, where a=1, b=0.1626, c= -0.00189.

Using the quadratic formula:

x = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)] / (2a)

Compute discriminant D = b² -4ac.

b² = (0.1626)^2 ≈ 0.02646

4ac = 4 * 1 * (-0.00189) = -0.00756

So D = 0.02646 - (-0.00756) = 0.02646 + 0.00756 = 0.03402

So sqrt(D) ≈ sqrt(0.03402) ≈ 0.1845

Then,

x = [ -0.1626 ± 0.1845 ] / 2

We can discard the negative solution because x represents concentration and can't be negative. So:

x = [ (-0.1626 + 0.1845) ] / 2 → (0.0219) / 2 → ≈ 0.01095 M

So x ≈ 0.01095 M.

So the [H+] from the second dissociation is x ≈ 0.01095 M.

But wait, the total [H+] is the sum from first and second dissociations. So initial [H+] is 0.15 M, plus x from the second, which is 0.01095.

So total [H+] = 0.15 + 0.01095 = 0.16095 M

Wait, but wait a second, in the initial setup, the first H+ is 0.15 M, and from the second dissociation, each HSO4^- gives another H+. So yes, adding that.

So [H+] total ≈ 0.16095 M.

So pH is -log(0.16095)

Let me calculate that. Log(0.16095) is the same as log(1.6095e-1) → log(1.6095) + (-1)

Log(1.6095) ≈ 0.2065. So log(0.16095) ≈ 0.2065 -1 = -0.7935. So pH is -(-0.7935) ≈ 0.7935.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 0.79. So that's very close. So would the answer be B?

Wait a minute, but wait. I think I might have made a mistake. Let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, let's recalculate the [H+] again.

We found x is approximately 0.01095 M.

So [H+] = 0.15 + 0.01095 = 0.16095 M.

Wait, but how about the HSO4^- dissociation. Alternatively, perhaps the second H+ is not as significant as I thought. Let me see.

Wait, another way to approach this is to realize that the first H+ is 0.15, and the second H+ contributes x, which is about 0.01095, so total [H+] is about 0.16095 M.

But another thought: in the second dissociation, each HSO4^- gives one H+, so the [H+] from second dissociation is x, which is 0.01095, but the initial [H+] is 0.15, which is much larger. So the total is 0.15 + 0.01095 = 0.16095.

So pH = -log(0.16095) ≈ 0.79, which matches option B.

But wait, wait. Let me think again. Oh wait, no, because when HSO4^- donates a proton, it's adding another H+ to the solution. So yeah, the first H+ is 0.15, and the second is x.

Wait, but in reality, the first H+ is 0.15 (completely dissociated), and in the second step, each HSO4^- can donate another H+.

So the total [H+] is 0.15 + x, where x is the amount of H+ from HSO4^-.

So yeah, my calculation seems correct.

But wait, wait another thing: the initial concentration of H+ is 0.15 M from the first dissociation, but when HSO4^- dissociates, it donates H+, so [H+] increases by x. So yes, 0.15 + x.

So the pH is about 0.79, which is option B.

But wait, looking at the options, option B is 0.79, which fits.

Another approach might be to approximate, but I think we did it correctly without approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption that x is not negligible could have led to a more precise calculation. But in this case, the answer comes close to option B.

Wait, wait a moment. Another thought: perhaps the first H+ is 0.15 M, and the second H+ is 0.01095 M, but in the solution, the total [H+] is 0.15 + 0.01095 = 0.16095, so pH is about 0.79.

But wait, another way to think is that the first H+ is 0.15, and the second H+ is 0.01095, but that the second H+ comes from HSO4^-.

So, perhaps the answer is B, 0.79. Let me double-check the calculation for x.

Quadratic equation: x² + 0.1626x - 0.00189 = 0.

Using the quadratic formula: x = [-0.1626 ± sqrt(0.1626² +4*0.00189)] / 2.

Wait, the discriminant D is b² - 4ac → (0.1626)^2 - 4*(1)*(-0.00189) → 0.02646 + 0.00756 = 0.03402.

sqrt(D)=0.1845.

Thus, x = [ -0.1626 + 0.1845 ] / 2 → (0.0219)/2 = 0.01095.

Yes, correct.

So [H+] = 0.15 + 0.01095 = 0.16095 M.

pH = -log(0.16095) ≈ 0.79.

So the correct answer should be option B: 0.79.

To find the pH of a 0.15 M H₂SO₄ solution, we consider the diprotic nature of sulfuric acid. The first dissociation, H₂SO₄ → H⁺ + HSO₄⁻, is complete, producing 0.15 M H⁺ and 0.15 M HSO₄⁻. The second dissociation, HSO₄⁻ ⇌ H⁺ + SO₄²⁻, is partial and governed by the equilibrium constant \( K_2 = 1.26 \times 10^{-2} \).

### Step 1: Set up the equilibrium expression
For the second dissociation:
- Initial concentrations: \([HSO₄⁻] = 0.15 \, \text{M}, [H⁺] = 0.15 \, \text{M}, [SO₄²⁻] = 0\).
- Change: \([HSO₄⁻] = 0.15 - x\), \([H⁺] = 0.15 + x\), \([SO₄²⁻] = x\).

The equilibrium constant expression is:
\[
K_2 = \frac{[H⁺][SO₄²⁻]}{[HSO₄⁻]} = \frac{(0.15 + x)(x)}{0.15 - x}.
\]

### Step 2: Solve for \(x\)
Substituting \(K_2 = 1.26 \times 10^{-2}\) into the equation:
\[
1.26 \times 10^{-2} = \frac{(0.15 + x)(x)}{0.15 - x}.
\]
Expanding and rearranging gives:
\[
x^2 + 0.1626x - 0.00189 = 0.
\]
Using the quadratic formula:
\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a},
\]
where \(a = 1\), \(b = 0.1626\), and \(c = -0.00189\). The discriminant is:
\[
b^2 - 4ac = (0.1626)^2 - 4(1)(-0.00189) = 0.02646 + 0.00756 = 0.03402.
\]
\[
\sqrt{0.03402} \approx 0.1845.
\]
Thus:
\[
x = \frac{-0.1626 \pm 0.1845}{2}.
\]
Taking the positive root:
\[
x = \frac{-0.1626 + 0.1845}{2} = \frac{0.0219}{2} \approx 0.01095 \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate total \([H⁺]\)
The total \([H⁺]\) is the sum of contributions from both dissociations:
\[
[H⁺] = 0.15 + x = 0.15 + 0.01095 = 0.16095 \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate pH
The pH is given by:
\[
\text{pH} = -\log[H⁺] = -\log(0.16095).
\]
Using \(\log(0.16095) \approx -0.7935\):
\[
\text{pH} \approx 0.7935 \approx 0.79.
\]

### Final Answer
The pH of the solution is approximately **0.79**, which corresponds to **option B**.
