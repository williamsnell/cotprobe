Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about short-term memory, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by recalling what I know about short-term memory from my psychology classes.

Short-term memory is often described as having limited capacity and duration. I remember something about George Miller's study where he said the magic number is seven, plus or minus two. That's about the capacity. But the question is about the two principal explanations for why this capacity is so limited.

Wait, explanations for limited capacity... So, maybe it's not just about how much we can hold, but why we can't hold more. I think there are two main theories or explanations here. One is about time decay, like if you don't repeat the information, it fades away after a certain time. The other is about interference, where new information comes in and pushes out the old stuff, making you forget.

So, interference is when new information disrupts the old, maybe because the brain can't handle too much at once. Time-decay is more about the passage of time causing forgetting if the information isn't rehearsed. So those two factors—interference and time decay—explain why our short-term memory capacity is limited.

Looking at the options, let's see:

A: Rehearsal and Forgetting – Rehearsal is a strategy, not an explanation for capacity limits.

B: Sensory Input and Cognitive Load – Not sure about that. Sensory input is more about where info comes from, and cognitive load is more about the amount of mental effort.

C: Interference and Time-Decay – Yep, that sounds right.

D: Capacity and Duration – Those are the characteristics, not the explanations.

E: Chunking and Associative Learning – Chunking is a way to increase capacity, so it's not an explanation for why it's limited.

F: Recall and Recognition – Those are types of memory retrieval, not explanations for capacity.

G: Attention and Distraction – Maybe related, but not the main explanations for capacity limits.

H: Encoding and Retrieval – Processes involved in memory, not the reasons for capacity.

I: Working Memory and Long-Term Storage – Working memory is part of short-term, but that's not explaining the limit.

J: Serial Position Effect – That's about order of recall, not capacity limitations.

So the correct answer should be option C.

The two principal explanations for the limited capacity of short-term memory are interference and time-decay. Interference occurs when new information disrupts the retention of older information, while time-decay refers to the forgetting of information over time if it is not rehearsed. Among the provided options, the correct answer aligns with these explanations.

Answer: C
