Okay, so I've got this question here about the history of biology and different scientists' views on species. The question is asking which group is composed entirely of individuals who thought species are fixed, meaning they don't change over time. The options are A through J, each listing three scientists. Hmm, I need to figure out which trio all believed in fixed species.

I remember from my studies that the concept of species being fixed is tied to the idea of creationism or special creation, where each species was created in its present form and doesn't change. So I need to think about which of these scientists held that belief.

Let me list out the scientists mentioned and what I remember about their views:

- Aristotle: I think he was more of a philosopher, believed in a scala naturae, or a ladder of life, where organisms are arranged in a hierarchy. But I'm not sure if he thought species change or not. Maybe he didn't consider species as fixed in the same way as others.

- Linnaeus: He's the father of taxonomy, right? He developed the binomial nomenclature. I believe he thought species were fixed because he was a creationist. He classified living things based on their traits, assuming they didn't change.

- Cuvier: He was a French biologist known for comparative anatomy and the idea of catastrophism. I think he believed in the fixity of species because he thought each species was created separately and couldn't change. So he was against evolution.

- Lamarck: Oh, wait, he's the one who proposed inheritance of acquired characteristics, right? So Lamarck believed in evolution. His theory was an early form of evolutionary thought, so he definitely didn't think species were fixed.

- Darwin: He's the big name in evolution. His theory of natural selection says species change over time through evolution. So he's definitely not in the fixed species group.

- Lyell: He was a geologist, uniformitarianism. His work influenced Darwin. I think he opposed the idea of evolution as well, or at least wasn't convinced by it. Wait, no, Lyell was actually against Lamarck's ideas and supported the fixity of species. Or did he change his mind later? Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on that. I think he was more about geological changes but didn't support biological evolution, so maybe he believed species are fixed.

Wait, let me try to clarify each scientist's stance:

- Aristotle: I'm not too confident, but I think he didn't have a clear concept of species as fixed or changing. His ideas were more about hierarchy.

- Linnaeus: Definitely fixed, as he was a creationist.

- Cuvier: Fixed species, as he was against evolution.

- Lamarck: Believed in species changing, so not fixed.

- Darwin: Opposed fixity, believed in evolution.

- Lyell: Wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Initially, Lyell opposed Lamarck's evolutionary ideas and supported fixity. But later, after Darwin's work, he might have changed. But in the context of the question, since the other options include older scientists, maybe Lyell was in the fixed camp.

So the question is to find the group where all three believed in fixed species.

Looking at the options:

Option C: Aristotle, Linnaeus, and Cuvier.

Option I: Lyell, Linnaeus, and Lamarck. But Lamarck doesn't fit, so I can eliminate I.

Option C: Do all three believe in fixed species? I'm not sure about Aristotle, but I know Linnaeus and Cuvier did.

Wait, another option: Option C is Aristotle, Linnaeus, and Cuvier. Assuming Aristotle was in the fixed camp, then this group fits.

Alternatively, let's check other options.

Option H: Lyell, Cuvier, and Darwin. No, Darwin doesn't fit.

Option F: Linnaeus, Cuvier, and Lamarck. No, Lamarck doesn't fit.

Option E: Linnaeus, Darwin, Lamarck. No, neither fit.

Option A: Aristotle, Darwin, Lamarck. No.

Option B: Aristotle, Lyell, Darwin. No.

Option D: Aristotle, Cuvier, Lamarck. No, Lamarck is wrong.

So the correct group should have Linnaeus and Cuvier, and either Aristotle or Lyell.

Wait, I'm trying to remember if Aristotle believed in fixity. I'm not too certain. Alternatively, maybe the trio is Linnaeus, Cuvier, and someone else.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the group is Linnaeus, Cuvier, and another who believed in fixity. Let me think about the options again.

Option C is Aristotle, Linnaeus, Cuvier. If that's the case, and if Aristotle believed in fixed species, then C is correct.

But I'm not entirely sure about Aristotle. Alternatively, perhaps Lyell is in the fixed group, but I'm not certain.

Wait, I think Lyell was a proponent of the idea that species were fixed. He was a contemporary of Lamarck and opposed his evolutionary ideas. So if that's the case, then maybe an option with Lyell, Cuvier, and someone else.

Looking at the options again, option H is Lyell, Cuvier, and Darwin. But Darwin doesn't fit. So that can't be.

Wait, maybe the correct trio is Linnaeus, Cuvier, and another. Let me look for an option with those two.

Option C: Yes, that includes Linnaeus and Cuvier, along with Aristotle.

So if Aristotle also believed in fixed species, then option C is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct trio is Linnaeus, Cuvier, and someone else.

Wait, another approach: Which scientists are known for believing in the fixity of species?

From what I remember, Linnaeus and Cuvier are definitely in that camp. So any option that includes both of them and a third who also believed in fixity.

Looking at the options, option C has Linnaeus and Cuvier with Aristotle. I think the question is whether Aristotle is part of that group.

But I'm not certain about Aristotle's stance. Alternatively, perhaps the group is Linnaeus, Cuvier, and another scientist not listed here, but in the options given, perhaps option C is the intended answer.

Another point: Lamarck and Darwin are definitely not in the fixed group, so any group containing them can be eliminated.

So looking at the options, C is the only one with both Linnaeus and Cuvier. So I think the answer is C.

To determine which group is composed entirely of individuals who maintained that species are fixed (i.e., unchanging), we analyze the views of the scientists listed in the options:

1. **Aristotle**: He believed in a hierarchical arrangement of life (scala naturae) but did not explicitly advocate for the fixity of species. His views on this matter are unclear.

2. **Linnaeus**: As the father of taxonomy, he classified species based on their traits and assumed they were fixed, aligning with creationist ideas.

3. **Cuvier**: A proponent of catastrophism and comparative anatomy, he believed in the fixity of species, rejecting evolutionary ideas.

4. **Lamarck**: He proposed the theory of inheritance of acquired characteristics, an early form of evolutionary thought, and thus did not believe in fixed species.

5. **Darwin**: His theory of natural selection describes species evolving over time, so he clearly opposed the fixity of species.

6. **Lyell**: While initially opposing evolutionary ideas and supporting the fixity of species, his views evolved over time. However, in the context of the question, he is often associated with the fixed species group.

Given this analysis, the group composed entirely of individuals who maintained that species are fixed must include **Linnaeus** and **Cuvier**, as they are definitively known to support fixity. The third member, **Aristotle**, is less certain but is included in the option that best fits the criteria.

Option C (**Aristotle, Linnaeus, and Cuvier**) is the most consistent with the requirement that all members believed in the fixity of species.

Answer: C
