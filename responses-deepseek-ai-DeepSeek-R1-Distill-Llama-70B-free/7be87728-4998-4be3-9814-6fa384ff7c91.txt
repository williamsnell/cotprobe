Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about motivation theories, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is: In which motivation theory are the key concepts outcome, valence, and expectancy? Then, I need to explain these three concepts in regard to this theory and the practical implications for employee motivation.

Hmm, I remember that motivation theories often have different key terms. Let me think about each option.

Option A: Two-factor theory. I think that's by Herzberg. It talks about motivators and hygiene factors. So, factors like recognition, advancement, and salary. But the terms here are outcome, valence, expectancy. Not sure if they fit.

Option B: Self-Determination Theory. This one focuses on intrinsic motivation and the needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness. The terms here might be things like intrinsic vs extrinsic rewards. Doesn't sound like the ones mentioned.

Option C: Expectancy Theory. Oh, right, this rings a bell. I think Expectancy Theory involves expectancies and valence. So the key concepts might be expectancy, valence, and maybe something else like instrumentality. Wait, the question mentions outcome, valence, and expectancy. So maybe outcome is part of it. Let me think more about this.

Expectancy Theory, as I recall, was developed by Victor Vroom. The basic idea is that a person's motivation depends on their expectation that their effort will lead to a certain outcome, and how much they value that outcome. So the three components are expectancy, instrumentality, and valence. Expectancy is the belief that effort leads to performance. Instrumentality is the belief that performance leads to outcome. Valence is the value or attractiveness of the outcome.

Wait, but the question lists outcome as a key concept. So in the theory, outcome is the result, like a reward or something. So the three terms would be expectancy (effort leads to performance), instrumentality (performance leads to outcome), and valence (value of the outcome). But the question says the key concepts are outcome, valence, and expectancy. So maybe it's considering outcome as the result, which is part of the model.

So, in Expectancy Theory, the motivation is calculated as Motivation = Expectancy × Instrumentality × Valence. Or something like that. So the concepts are these three. Wait, but the question lists outcome as a key concept. So perhaps the theory includes outcome as one of the variables. So I think option C is the correct theory.

Let me go through the other options to make sure. Option D is Equity Theory, which deals with fairness and comparing oneself to others. Terms like inputs, outputs, and equity. Not matching the question.

Option E: Herzberg's theory, as I thought earlier, is about motivators and hygiene factors. Doesn't include these terms.

Option F: Goal-Setting Theory. This is about setting specific goals to enhance performance. Terms like specific, challenging goals, feedback. Not the ones here.

Option G: Maslow's Hierarchy. It's about different levels of needs, from physiological to self-actualization. Not related.

Option H: McClelland's Theory of Needs. It's about three needs: achievement, power, and affiliation. Again, doesn't match.

Option I: Cognitive Evaluation Theory. This deals with intrinsic and extrinsic rewards affecting motivation. Terms like self-determination. Not the same.

Option J: Attribution Theory. It's about how people explain causes of events. Not related.

So, the only theory that includes expectancy and valence as key concepts is Expectancy Theory (Option C). The third term in the question is outcome, which fits because the model talks about outcomes as the results of performance.

Now, explaining the concepts:

Expectancy is the individual's belief that their effort will lead to achieving a certain level of performance. So, if I work hard, I think I'll meet my targets.

Valence refers to the value or attractiveness of the outcome. If the outcome is something the person desires, valence is high; if not, it's low.

Outcome is the actual result or reward that the person expects to receive if they perform well.

Practical implications for employee motivation: Understanding these concepts can help managers design reward systems that align with what employees value. For example, if an employee values a promotion (high valence), the manager should ensure that achieving specific performance goals (expectancy) leads to that promotion (outcome). Also, making sure employees believe their efforts will lead to the desired outcomes (high expectancy) and that the outcomes are meaningful (high valence) can boost motivation.

So, putting it all together, the answer should be C: Expectancy Theory.

The motivation theory that includes the key concepts of outcome, valence, and expectancy is **Expectancy Theory**, developed by Victor Vroom. This theory posits that motivation is determined by an individual's expectations about the likelihood of achieving a desired outcome and the value they place on that outcome.

1. **Expectancy**: This refers to an individual's belief that their effort will lead to a specific level of performance. For example, if an employee believes that working harder will result in meeting their sales targets, their expectancy is high.

2. **Valence**: This is the perceived value or attractiveness of the outcome. If the outcome (e.g., a promotion or bonus) is something the individual desires, the valence is high; if not, it is low.

3. **Outcome**: This is the actual result or reward that the individual expects to receive if they achieve the desired performance level.

**Practical Implications for Employee Motivation**:
- Managers should align reward systems with outcomes that employees value highly (high valence).
- Ensure that employees perceive a clear link between their effort and desired outcomes (high expectancy).
- Communicate effectively about how performance leads to specific rewards to enhance motivation.

Thus, the correct answer is **C: Expectancy Theory**.
