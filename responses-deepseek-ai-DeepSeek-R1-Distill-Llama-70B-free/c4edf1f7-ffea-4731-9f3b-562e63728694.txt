Okay, so I've got this physics problem about synchronizing two clocks. Hmm, I remember this has something to do with relativity, maybe Einstein's theory? Let me think.

The question is asking how to synchronize two clocks—one at the origin and another a distance d away. Right, in special relativity, synchronizing clocks that are far apart isn't as straightforward because of the speed of light and simultaneity. So what's the method?

Wait, I think the standard approach involves sending a light signal. Oh right, Einstein's synchronization method. The idea is to set the distant clock so that the time it shows accounts for the light travel time. But how exactly?

So, suppose the origin clock is at time T. We send a light signal to the distant clock. Since light takes time to travel, the distant clock can't just be set to T when the signal arrives because that would make it behind by the travel time. Or wait, maybe it's the opposite.

Wait, let me go through the process step by step. Let's say at time T, the origin sends a light signal to the distant clock. The light takes time d/c to reach it, where d is the distance and c is the speed of light. So the signal arrives at the distant clock at time T + d/c. But if the distant clock hasn't been set yet, when the signal arrives, we need to set it. But how?

Wait, no. Einstein's method is to have the distant clock set to T - d/c. Because when the origin clock is at T, the light leaves, and takes d/c time to reach the distant clock. So the distant clock would need to have started at a time that, when the light arrives, it shows the same time as the origin. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around.

Alternatively, maybe the correct approach is to have the distant clock set to T - d/c when the origin is at T. Because the light takes d/c time to reach it, so the distant clock is set that way so that when the light arrives, it's showing the same time as the origin's current time. Wait, no, I'm getting confused.

Let me think again. If I'm at the origin and I send a light signal at time T, it arrives at the distant clock at T + d/c. If I want both clocks to show the same time (synchronized), then I need to set the distant clock such that when the light arrives, it's showing the same time as the origin would at that moment.

But no, that's not possible because the origin's clock is moving forward in time. So maybe instead, the synchronization is done by ensuring that the time it takes for the light to go and return is accounted for. Wait, no, the question is about a single trip. Or perhaps it's a one-way synchronization.

Wait, another approach: The proper way to synchronize is to have the distant clock set to the origin's time minus the one-way light travel time. Because when you send a signal at T, it arrives at T + d/c. So to make the distant clock match, you set it back by d/c. So when the signal arrives, the distant clock shows T, same as the origin's current time.

Wait, that makes sense. So if the origin sends a signal at T, it arrives at T + d/c. But we want the distant clock to be set to T when the signal arrives. So the distant clock was set to T - d/c before the signal was sent. Because by the time the signal arrives, it's been d/c time, so the distant clock would have advanced to T.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me think again. Suppose the origin clock is at T. The signal leaves at T and arrives at T + d/c. So when the signal arrives, the origin clock is already at T + d/c. We want the distant clock to be synchronized with the origin's clock at that moment. So the distant clock should show T + d/c when the signal arrives.

But the distant clock was set to some initial time before the signal was sent. So let's say the distant clock was set to T0. The light takes d/c time to reach it. So when the signal arrives, the distant clock has advanced by d/c, from T0 to T0 + d/c. But this should equal the origin's current time, which is T + d/c. So:

T0 + d/c = T + d/c → T0 = T.

Wait, that can't be right because then the distant clock would just be set to T. But that doesn't account for the travel time. Hmm, I'm getting myself mixed up.

Wait, maybe the correct approach is that when the origin clock shows T, it sends a signal that takes d/c to reach the distant clock. The distant clock, upon receiving the signal, should be set to T, but since it took d/c time, the distant clock would have to be set to T - d/c at the time the signal was sent. Because when the signal arrives, it would have advanced by d/c, showing T.

Wait, that makes sense. So the distant clock needs to be set to T - d/c when the origin clock is at T. Because when the light arrives, the distant clock has advanced by d/c, so it shows T.

Looking at the options, which one matches this?

Option C: The other clock should be pre-set to current time minus d/c → That sounds correct because when the signal arrives, it's T - d/c + d/c = T.

Option H says pre-set to current time minus the time for light to travel d. That's the same as d/c. So H would be T - (d/c). So that's the same as option C.

Wait, looking back, the options:

Option C: current time minus d/c.

Option H: current time minus d/c (since d/c is the time for light to travel d).

So wait, option C and H are the same? Or did I misread?

Wait, option C says "the current time minus d/c", which I think is correct. Option H says "the current time minus the time it takes light to travel distance d", which is the same as d/c. So options C and H are the same. But looking back, that's impossible because each option is unique.

Wait, perhaps I got the options wrong. Let me check again.

The options are:

A: pre-set to current time, assuming instantaneous.

B: use sound waves.

C: pre-set to current time minus d/c.

D: 12:00 + d/c.

E: d/c past origin.

F: exactly 12:00.

G: arbitrary time.

H: current time minus time for light (d/c).

So options C and H are the same, but that's not possible in a multiple-choice question. Did I make a mistake?

Wait no, looking again, perhaps option C is "minus d/c", while H says "minus the time for light to travel d".

Which are the same. So perhaps the correct answer is both C and H, but that's not possible. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I got the reasoning wrong. Let me think again.

The correct method is to set the distant clock to the origin's current time minus the one-way light travel time. So the correct answer would be C or H, but both can't be correct.

Wait, looking at the options:

Option C: pre-set to current time minus d/c.

Option H: pre-set to current time minus time for light to travel d.

Which are the same. But that's not possible in this setup. Hmm, perhaps I'm confusing the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is H. Because the reasoning is that when you send the signal, the distant clock must account for the time it takes the signal to reach it. So you set it back by that time.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is E. No, E says d/c past the origin's time. That would make the distant clock ahead, which doesn't make sense because the signal takes time to reach it.

So going back, the correct approach is that the distant clock is set to the origin's current time minus d/c. So option C.

Wait, but I thought H is the same. Let me reread the options.

Option C: "current time minus d/c".

Option H: "current time minus the time it takes light to travel distance d".

Yes, same thing. So both C and H are correct, which can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in the reasoning.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is H. Because the way the question is phrased, you pre-set the other clock before sending the signal. So when you send the signal, the other clock is already set to T - d/c, so when the signal arrives, it's T.

Wait, but according to the options, the answer would be C or H, but both can't be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C, because it's about pre-setting to current time minus d/c.

Wait, maybe I should recall the standard synchronization procedure. The standard method is to have the distant clock set to the origin's time minus the one-way travel time. So that's option C.

Alternatively, in some methods, you might set the clock when the signal arrives, but that's not pre-setting.

Wait, the question says the other clock should be pre-set. So when the signal arrives, the distant clock has been running and shows the correct time.

So the correct pre-set is origin's current time minus d/c.

So the correct answer would be option C.

Wait, but option H says "pre-set to current time minus the time it takes light..." which is the same as C.

Hmm, perhaps the intended correct answer is H, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, let me think about it differently. Suppose the origin clock shows time T. The distant clock is at rest at a distance d. We send a light signal from the origin at T. The signal takes d/c time to reach the distant clock, arriving at T + d/c. At that moment, we set the distant clock to T. So the distant clock was started at T - d/c, so that when the signal arrives at T + d/c, the distant clock shows T.

Wait no, because if the distant clock was set to T - d/c, then when the signal arrives (after d/c time), the distant clock would have advanced by d/c, showing T.

So yes, that's correct. So the distant clock must be pre-set to T - d/c, which is option C.

But option H says the same thing, because "the time it takes light to travel d" is d/c. So both C and H are correct, which can't be.

Wait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me check again.

Option C: "current time minus d/c".

Option H: "current time minus the time it takes light to travel distance d".

Yes, they're the same. So this implies that perhaps the options are incorrect, but that's unlikely. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E, but no, E says d/c past the origin's time, which would mean the distant clock is ahead. That doesn't make sense because the light hasn't had time to reach it yet.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The correct answer is C: The other clock should be pre-set to the current time minus d/c.

So I'll go with option C.

To synchronize two clocks—one at the origin and the other a distance \( d \) away—we need to account for the finite speed of light (\( c \)) and the time it takes for a signal to travel between the clocks. In Einstein's synchronization method, the distant clock should be pre-set to the origin's current time minus the one-way light travel time, \( d/c \). This ensures that when a light signal is sent from the origin at time \( T \), it arrives at the distant clock at \( T + d/c \), and the distant clock, having been pre-set to \( T - d/c \), will show \( T \) when the signal arrives.

### Analysis of the Options:
- **A:** Incorrect. Assuming instantaneous signal travel time is not physically valid, as nothing can exceed the speed of light.
- **B:** Incorrect. Using sound waves is irrelevant, as sound travels much slower than light and is not suitable for precise synchronization.
- **C:** Correct. The distant clock should be pre-set to the current time minus \( d/c \), accounting for the one-way light travel time.
- **D:** Incorrect. Adding \( d/c \) to 12:00 does not align with the synchronization procedure.
- **E:** Incorrect. Setting the distant clock to \( d/c \) past the origin's time would make it ahead, which is inconsistent with the light travel time.
- **F:** Incorrect. Setting the distant clock to exactly 12:00 does not account for the relative positions of the clocks.
- **G:** Incorrect. Setting the distant clock to an arbitrary time unrelated to the origin clock and distance \( d \) would not achieve synchronization.
- **H:** Correct. This is equivalent to option C, as "the time it takes light to travel distance \( d \)" is \( d/c \). Thus, both C and H describe the same valid synchronization method.
- **I:** Not applicable, as this option is missing.

### Conclusion:
Both options C and H describe the correct synchronization method, but since only one answer can be selected, the choice is **C**.
