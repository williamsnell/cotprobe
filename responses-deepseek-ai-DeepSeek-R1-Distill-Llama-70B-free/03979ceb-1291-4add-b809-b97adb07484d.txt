Okay, I've got this problem here about calculating how long the world's coal and natural gas reserves will last based on current consumption rates. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

So the reserves are estimated to be 3.0 × 10^19 Kcal. And the consumption rate is given as 4.2 × 10^27 ergs per year. Wait, I need to make sure the units match before I can do any calculations because right now they're in different units—Kcal and ergs.

I remember that 1 Kcal is equal to 4.184 × 10^3 kilojoules, but wait, maybe it's easier to convert everything to the same unit, like ergs. Oh right, because the consumption is in ergs/year. So I need to convert the reserve from Kcal to ergs.

Wait, wait. Let me get the conversions right. I recall that 1 calorie (cal) is equal to 4.184 joules, and 1 Kcal is 1000 calories, so that's 4184 joules. But wait, no, wait, 1 Kcal is 4.184 × 10^3 joules. And 1 joule is 10^7 ergs because 1 joule = 10^7 ergs. So to convert Kcal to ergs, I can do this:

1 Kcal = 4184 J (since 1 Kcal = 1000 cal, and 1 cal = 4.184 J). Then, 1 J = 1e7 ergs. So 1 Kcal = 4184 * 1e7 ergs. Let me calculate that. 4184 * 1e7 is 4.184e10 ergs per Kcal.

Wait, maybe I should write that as 4.184 × 10^10 ergs per Kcal. So the total reserve is 3.0e19 Kcal. So to convert that to ergs, I multiply by 4.184e10 ergs/Kcal.

So the total in ergs is 3.0e19 * 4.184e10 = let's compute that. 3e19 * 4.184e10 = 3 *4.184 = 12.552, and the exponents add 19 +10 =29. So 12.552e29 ergs. Wait, but wait, 3e19 times 4.184e10 is 3 *4.184 =12.552, and 10^19 *10^10 is 10^(29). So total is 1.2552e30 ergs. Wait, no, wait: 12.552e29 is the same as 1.2552e30 ergs. Because 12.552e29 = 1.2552e30.

Okay, so the reserve is 1.2552e30 ergs.

Now, the consumption rate is 4.2e27 ergs per year. So to find out how many years the reserves will last, I divide the total reserves by the annual consumption.

So time in years = total ergs / (ergs per year) = (1.2552e30 ergs) / (4.2e27 ergs/year).

Let me compute that. 1.2552e30 / 4.2e27. Let's separate the exponents. 1e30 /1e27 is 1e3, so 1000. Then 1.2552 /4.2 is approximately what?

Let me calculate that division. 1.2552 divided by 4.2. Let's see: 4.2 goes into 1.2552 how many times. 4.2 * 0.3 is 1.26. Oh wait, 4.2 * 0.3 = 1.26, which is just a bit more than 1.2552. So approximately 0.2976. Because 4.2 * 0.2976 = let's see: 0.3 is 1.26, subtract 0.0024 *4.2 which is 0.01, so approximately 1.26 -0.01=1.25, which is close to 1.2552. So about 0.2976.

So 0.2976 * 1e3 is 297.6 years. So about 298 years.

Looking at the options, the choices are:

A: 200 years

B:250

C:500

D:400

E:700

F:100

G:600

H:350

I:300

J:800

Hmm, 298 is closest to 300 years, which is option I. But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, wait. Let me go through the unit conversions again. Because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake there.

Reserves: 3.0e19 Kcal.

1 Kcal = 4.184e3 J (since 1 Kcal is 1000 cal, and 1 cal is 4.184 J).

Wait no, 1 cal is 4.184 J, so 1 Kcal is 4184 J, which is 4.184e3 J. Then, 1 J is 1e7 ergs. So 1 Kcal = 4.184e3 J * 1e7 ergs/J = 4.184e10 ergs.

So 3e19 Kcal is 3e19 *4.184e10 = 3*4.184 =12.552; 1e19 *1e10 =1e29, so 12.552e29 ergs, which is 1.2552e30 ergs. That's correct.

Consumption rate: 4.2e27 ergs/year.

So time is 1.2552e30 /4.2e27 = (1.2552 /4.2 )e3.

1.2552 /4.2 = approximately 0.2985. 0.2985 *1e3 = 298.5 years. So about 299 years.

Looking at the options, the closest is I:300 years. But wait, let me see if any other options are closer. The options are in 50-year increments mostly.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation when converting units. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: instead of converting Kcal to ergs, perhaps convert the consumption rate from ergs/year to Kcal/year. Then divide the reserves by that to get the time.

Let me try that approach.

Reserves: 3.0e19 Kcal.

Consumption rate: 4.2e27 ergs/year.

I need to convert ergs/year to Kcal/year.

We know that 1 Kcal = 4.184e10 ergs.

So 4.2e27 ergs/year is equal to (4.2e27 ergs/year) / (4.184e10 ergs/Kcal) = (4.2 /4.184 )e(27-10) Kcal/year.

Calculating 4.2 /4.184 is approximately 1.0038. So about 1.0e17 Kcal/year.

Wait, 4.2 /4.184 is roughly 1.0038. So 1.0038e17 Kcal/year.

So the consumption rate is approximately 1.004e17 Kcal per year.

So the time is reserves divided by consumption: 3e19 / 1.004e17.

3e19 / 1e17 is 3e2, which is 300. But with 1.004 in the denominator, it's 3e19 / (1.004e17) = (3 /1.004 )e2.

3 /1.004 is approximately 2.988. So 2.988e2 years is 298.8 years. Again, approximately 299 years.

So same result as before. So the answer should be about 300 years, which is option I.

Wait, but when I did it the first way, I got 298.5. So it's around 300. So the correct answer is I: 300 years.

To determine how long the world's coal and natural gas reserves will last at the current consumption rate, we start by converting the units to ensure consistency. The total reserves are given as \( 3.0 \times 10^{19} \, \text{Kcal} \), and the consumption rate is \( 4.2 \times 10^{27} \, \text{ergs/year} \). 

### Step 1: Convert reserves from Kcal to ergs
1 Kcal is equivalent to \( 4.184 \times 10^{10} \, \text{ergs} \). Therefore, the total reserves in ergs are:

\[
3.0 \times 10^{19} \, \text{Kcal} \times 4.184 \times 10^{10} \, \text{ergs/Kcal} = 1.2552 \times 10^{30} \, \text{ergs}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the time in years
The consumption rate is \( 4.2 \times 10^{27} \, \text{ergs/year} \). To find the time in years, divide the total reserves by the consumption rate:

\[
\text{Time (years)} = \frac{1.2552 \times 10^{30} \, \text{ergs}}{4.2 \times 10^{27} \, \text{ergs/year}}.
\]

Separate the coefficients and exponents:

\[
\text{Time (years)} = \left( \frac{1.2552}{4.2} \right) \times 10^{3}.
\]

Perform the division of the coefficients:

\[
\frac{1.2552}{4.2} \approx 0.2985.
\]

Thus:

\[
\text{Time (years)} = 0.2985 \times 10^{3} = 298.5 \, \text{years}.
\]

### Step 3: Match the closest option
The calculated time is approximately \( 298.5 \, \text{years} \), which is closest to \( 300 \, \text{years} \).

### Final Answer:
I: 300 years.
