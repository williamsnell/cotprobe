Okay, I need to solve this logic problem. Let me read it again. The question is about constructing a complete truth table for two propositions and then determining their logical relationship. The two propositions are I ≡ ~H and ~(~I ≡ H). 

First, I think I should break down each proposition to understand what they mean. The first one is straightforward: I is equivalent to not H. The second is a bit trickier: it's the negation of (~I equivalent to H). 

Wait, let's write them out more clearly. Let me denote them as:

Proposition 1: I ≡ ~H
Proposition 2: ~(~I ≡ H)

I need to construct the truth table for these two. So, I should list all possible truth values for I and H, compute the truth values for each proposition, and then compare them.

The variables are I and H, each can be true (T) or false (F). So four possible combinations: TT, TF, FT, FF.

Let me create a table:

I | H | ~H | I ≡ ~H | ~I | ~I ≡ H | ~(~I ≡ H)
---|---|----|-------|----|--------|----------
T | T | F  | F     | F  | F      | T
T | F | T  | T     | F  | T      | F
F | T | F  | F     | T  | T      | F
F | F | T  | T     | T  | F      | T

Wait, let me compute each step carefully.

For each row:

1. I=T, H=T:
   ~H is F
   I ≡ ~H: T ≡ F → F
   ~I is F
   ~I ≡ H: F ≡ T → F
   So ~(~I ≡ H) is ~F → T

2. I=T, H=F:
   ~H is T
   I ≡ ~H: T ≡ T → T
   ~I is F
   ~I ≡ H: F ≡ F → T
   So ~(~I ≡ H) is ~T → F

Wait, wait. Wait, when I=T and H=F:

~I is F. Then ~I ≡ H: H is F, so F ≡ F is T. So the negation would be F.

3. I=F, H=T:
   ~H is F
   I ≡ ~H: F ≡ F → T
   ~I is T
   ~I ≡ H: T ≡ T → T
   So ~(~I ≡ H) is F.

Wait, no: I=F, so I ≡ ~H: H is T, so ~H is F. F ≡ F → T. So proposition 1 is T.

Proposition 2: ~I is T. So ~I ≡ H: T ≡ T → T. Then the negation is F.

Wait, no: H is T here, so ~I (which is T) ≡ H (T) → T. So ~(T) is F.

4. I=F, H=F:
   ~H is T
   I ≡ ~H: F ≡ T → F
   ~I is T
   ~I ≡ H: T ≡ F → F
   So ~(~I ≡ H) is ~F → T.

Wait, let me correct that. For the last row:

I=F, H=F.

I ≡ ~H: F vs ~H which is T. So F ≡ T is F.

~I is T. Then, ~I ≡ H is T ≡ F → F. So the negation is T.

So the truth table for proposition 1 and 2 would be:

Row 1: I=T, H=T → P1=F, P2=T
Row 2: I=T, H=F → P1=T, P2=F
Row 3: I=F, H=T → P1=T, P2=F
Row 4: I=F, H=F → P1=F, P2=T

Wait, let me make sure the calculations are correct.

Another approach: Let's recompute each step for each row.

First row: I=T, H=T.

~H = F.

I ≡ ~H: T ≡ F → F.

~I = F.

~I ≡ H: F ≡ T → F.

~(F) → T.

So P2 is T.

Second row: I=T, H=F.

~H = T.

I ≡ ~H: T ≡ T → T.

~I = F.

~I ≡ H: F ≡ F → T.

~(T) → F.

So P2 is F.

Third row: I=F, H=T.

~H = F.

I ≡ ~H: F ≡ F → T.

~I = T.

~I ≡ H: T ≡ T → T.

~(T) → F.

Fourth row: I=F, H=F.

~H = T.

I ≡ ~H: F ≡ T → F.

~I = T.

~I ≡ H: T ≡ F → F.

~(F) → T.

So the complete table is:

I | H | I ≡ ~H (P1) | ~(~I ≡ H) (P2)
---|---|------------|-------------
T | T | F          | T
T | F | T          | F
F | T | T          | F
F | F | F          | T

Now, let's list the truth values of P1 and P2:

P1: F, T, T, F

P2: T, F, F, T

Wait, looking at P1 and P2, for each row:

Row1: P1=F, P2=T

Row2: P1=T, P2=F

Row3: P1=T, P2=F

Row4: P1=F, P2=T

So when P1 is true (rows 2 and 3), P2 is false. When P1 is false (rows 1 and 4), P2 is true.

So P2 is the negation of P1. Because whenever P1 is T, P2 is F, and vice versa.

Wait, that would mean that P1 and P2 are logical negations of each other. So they are contradictory.

Wait, but let's see. Let me compare P1 and P2.

Wait, P1 is I ≡ ~H.

P2 is ~(~I ≡ H). Let me simplify P2 logically.

~( ~I ≡ H ) is equivalent to ~( (¬I) ≡ H ). 

I remember that A ≡ B is equivalent to (A → B) ∧ (B → A). The negation would be when at least one direction fails.

Alternatively, using logical equivalences, I think that A ≡ B is equivalent to (A∨B) ∧ (¬A∨¬B), but perhaps that's more complicated.

Alternatively, I can use the fact that ~(A ≡ B) is equivalent to (A ⊕ B), the exclusive OR.

Wait, but maybe I can simplify P2.

P2: ~(~I ≡ H) → which is equivalent to (¬I ≡ H) → is this equivalent to something else?

Wait, let's see. Let me think about the equivalence.

Alternatively, let's use some logical identities. I remember that A ≡ B is equivalent to (A → B) ∧ (B → A). So the negation is when either A doesn't imply B, or B doesn't imply A, but at least one.

But perhaps a simpler approach is to note that ~(~I ≡ H) is equivalent to (I ≡ ~H). Wait, is that true?

Wait, let's check with the truth table. Let me compute for P2:

P2 is ~(~I ≡ H). Let's see if that's equivalent to I ≡ ~H.

Wait, looking at the truth table for P1 (I ≡ ~H) and P2, they are opposites. Because in row 1, P1=F and P2=T. So P2 is the negation of P1.

Wait, let's see:

Is P2 equivalent to ¬P1?

Looking at the truth values:

P1: F, T, T, F

P2: T, F, F, T

Yes, P2 is the negation of P1.

Because for each row, P2 is T when P1 is F, and F when P1 is T.

So that would imply that P1 and P2 are contradictory propositions. Because they have opposite truth values in all cases.

Wait, but wait. Let me confirm. If two propositions are contradictory, does that mean they are always opposite? Yes.

So, the two propositions are contradictory.

But wait, the options mention whether they are contradictory, or logically equivalent, etc.

Looking at the options:

Option G says "Contradictory". So that's a possibility.

But wait, let me think again. The question asks whether they are logically equivalent, contradictory, consistent, or inconsistent.

Wait, another possibility: if two propositions are contradictory, that means they can never both be true at the same time. So they are always opposite. So their conjunction is always false, and their disjunction is a tautology.

But looking back at the options, I need to see what each option says.

The options are:

A: Neither logically equivalent nor contradictory, but consistent.

B: Both contradictory and inconsistent.

C: Neither logically equivalent, contradictory, consistent, nor inconsistent.

D: Both contradictory and consistent.

E: Both logically equivalent and consistent.

F: Logically equivalent.

G: Contradictory.

H: Inconsistent.

I: Neither logically equivalent nor contradictory, but inconsistent.

J: Both logically equivalent and contradictory.

Wait, but from the truth table, P1 and P2 are always opposite, so they are contradictory. So option G would apply.

But wait, the first part of the question says to construct the truth tables and then determine if the statements are logically equivalent or contradictory. If neither, then check if they're consistent or inconsistent.

Wait, but if they are contradictory, then they can't be consistent, right?

Wait, because consistency means that there's at least one scenario where both are true. But since they're contradictory, whenever one is true, the other is false. So there's no scenario where both are true. So they are inconsistent.

Wait, that's an important point. So if two statements are contradictory, that means that in every possible scenario, they have opposite truth values. So in no case are both true. Therefore, they are inconsistent.

Wait, but I thought that contradictory meant that they are always opposite, which would make them inconsistent as well. Because consistency is when there's at least one scenario where both are true.

So, in this case, P1 and P2 are contradictory and inconsistent.

Looking at the options:

Option B: Both contradictory and inconsistent.

Option G: Contradictory.

So which is correct?

Wait, the question is to determine whether the statements are logically equivalent or contradictory. If neither, determine whether they are consistent or inconsistent.

So, since they are contradictory, the answer would be G.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because if two statements are contradictory, then they are also inconsistent, since there's no model where both are true.

So perhaps the correct answer is that they are both contradictory and inconsistent.

Looking back, the options:

Option B says "Both contradictory and inconsistent."

Option G says only "Contradictory."

I think the correct answer would be option B, because the statements are both contradictory and inconsistent.

Wait, let me think again. Are contradictory statements necessarily inconsistent?

Yes, because inconsistency is defined as there being no model where both are true. Since in all models, they are opposite, there's no model where both are true, hence they are inconsistent.

So the statements are both contradictory and inconsistent.

So in the options, option B is "Both contradictory and inconsistent."

Wait, but let me double-check. Let me recall the definitions.

Two statements are:

- Logically equivalent if they have the same truth values in all possible scenarios.

- Contradictory if they have opposite truth values in all scenarios.

- Consistent if there is at least one scenario where both are true.

- Inconsistent if there is no scenario where both are true.

So, in our case, since P1 and P2 are contradictory, they are always opposite. Therefore, in no scenario are both true, so they are inconsistent.

So they are both contradictory and inconsistent.

Looking back, option B says both.

So the correct answer is option B.

Wait, but earlier I thought that option G was correct, but that's only about contradictory, not considering inconsistency.

So the correct answer is option B: Both contradictory and inconsistent.

To determine the logical relationship between the propositions \( I \equiv \neg H \) and \( \neg (\neg I \equiv H) \), we construct a truth table and analyze their truth values.

### Truth Table:

| \( I \) | \( H \) | \( \neg H \) | \( I \equiv \neg H \) (P1) | \( \neg I \) | \( \neg I \equiv H \) | \( \neg (\neg I \equiv H) \) (P2) |
|---------|---------|--------------|--------------------------|-------------|----------------------|--------------------------------|
| \( T \) | \( T \) | \( F \)      | \( F \)                   | \( F \)     | \( F \)               | \( T \)                        |
| \( T \) | \( F \) | \( T \)      | \( T \)                   | \( F \)     | \( T \)               | \( F \)                        |
| \( F \) | \( T \) | \( F \)      | \( T \)                   | \( T \)     | \( T \)               | \( F \)                        |
| \( F \) | \( F \) | \( T \)      | \( F \)                   | \( T \)     | \( F \)               | \( T \)                        |

### Analysis:

1. **Logical Equivalence**: Two propositions are logically equivalent if they have the same truth values in all possible scenarios. Comparing \( P1 \) and \( P2 \), their truth values are opposites in every row. Therefore, they are **not logically equivalent**.

2. **Contradictory**: Two propositions are contradictory if they have opposite truth values in all possible scenarios. Since \( P1 \) and \( P2 \) are opposites in every row, they are **contradictory**.

3. **Consistency**: Two propositions are consistent if there is at least one scenario where both are true. Since \( P1 \) and \( P2 \) are always opposites, there is no scenario where both are true. Therefore, they are **inconsistent**.

### Conclusion:

The propositions \( I \equiv \neg H \) and \( \neg (\neg I \equiv H) \) are both **contradictory** and **inconsistent**.
