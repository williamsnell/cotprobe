Okay, I'm trying to solve this diffraction problem. Let's see what the question is about. So, there's a circular aperture with a radius of 0.8 mm, and it's illuminated by monochromatic light. The setup is that the emerging light falls on a movable screen. As the screen moves towards the aperture, they observe alternately light and dark spots at the center. 

The question has four parts, (a) through (d). I'll focus on part (a) first. 

In part (a), a bright spot appears for the second time when the screen is 36.2 cm from the position where the first bright spot occurred. I need to find the wavelength of the light.

Hmm. I remember that in Fresnel diffraction from a circular aperture, the central bright spot is known as the Airy disk. The condition for constructive and destructive interference at the center is related to the distance from the aperture. 

Wait, when the screen is at a certain position, the path difference leads to bright or dark spots. For a bright spot, the path difference should be an integer multiple of the wavelength. And for dark spots, it's an odd multiple of half the wavelength.

Wait, the formula I remember for the bright spots (constructive interference) is mλ = D, where D is the distance from the aperture to the screen, and m is an integer (like 1, 2, 3...). Similarly, for dark spots, it's (m + 1/2)λ = D. 

Wait, no, maybe I should think in terms of the Fresnel diffraction pattern. The positions where the bright and dark fringes occur can be determined based on the distance. The formula might involve the radius of the aperture, a, and the distance D from the aperture to the screen.

Wait, the general condition for the m-th bright fringe and the m-th dark fringe in the central pattern is given by:

For bright fringe: (a² / D) = (m - 1/2)λ, but I'm not too sure. Alternatively, I think the formula is a² = (mλ D), where m is the order. No, wait, maybe it's a² = (m - ½) λ D for bright spots when m=1,2,... and a² = m λ D for dark spots when m=1,2,....

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The condition for the central maximum (first bright spot) is when the screen is at a very far distance (Fraunhofer diffraction), but here the screen is movable, so perhaps it's in the near field (Fresnel diffraction). 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the concept of the Fresnel zones and the conditions for constructive and destructive interference. The radius of each Fresnel zone is given by r_m = sqrt(m λ D), where m is the zone number. But wait, maybe that's for the radius on the aperture. 

Wait, I think the condition for a bright spot at the center is when an even number of half-wavelength zones contribute constructively, and dark when odd. So each time the screen moves a certain distance, you get an additional zone contributing, leading to a change in the central spot's brightness.

So when the screen is at a distance D, the number of Fresnel zones is given by N = (a²)/(λ D). 

If N is an integer, then the central spot is dark because an odd number of half-wavelengths would cancel out. If N is a half-integer, the central spot is bright.

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. The condition for a bright spot is when N = m + ½, where m is an integer. And for a dark spot, N = m, where m is integer.

Because when N is an integer, you have an even number of half-cycles, leading to destructive interference (dark), and when it's a half-integer, you have an odd number of half-cycles, leading to constructive interference (bright).

So for the first bright spot, N = 1 + ½ = 3/2. So,

N = a²/(λ D1) = 3/2 → D1 = (2 a²) / (3 λ)

Similarly, the second bright spot occurs when N = 5/2, so D2 = (2 a²) / (5 λ).

Wait, but in the problem, they're considering the distance between the first and second occurrence. So, D2 - D1 = 36.2 cm.

So, let me compute that.

D2 = (2 a²) / (5 λ)
D1 = (2 a²) / (3 λ)
So D2 - D1 = (2 a²) (1/(5λ) - 1/(3λ)) ) = (2 a²) ( (3 -5) / (15 λ) ) ) = (2 a²) ( (-2) / (15 λ) )

Wait, but this would give a negative difference, which doesn't make sense because D2 should be larger than D1. Wait, no, wait. Because when the screen is moved towards the aperture, the distance D decreases. Oh, wait no, the screen is moving towards the aperture, so the distance D is the distance between the aperture and the screen. So, when the screen moves closer, D decreases. 

So the first bright spot occurs at D1, and the second at D2, where D2 < D1. But in the problem, the distance from the screen to the position where the first bright spot occurred is 36.2 cm. So when moving the screen towards the aperture, the second bright spot appears at D2, which is D1 - 36.2 cm.

Wait, perhaps I should model it as D2 = D1 - 36.2 cm. Or perhaps the other way around. Wait, let's clarify:

When the screen is at D1, first bright spot occurs. Then, as the screen moves closer (D decreases), the next bright spot occurs at D2, and the distance between D1 and D2 is 36.2 cm. So D1 - D2 = 36.2 cm.

So, D1 = (2 a²) / (3 λ)
D2 = (2 a²) / (5 λ)
So D1 - D2 = (2 a²) (1/3 - 1/5) / λ = (2 a²) (2/15) / λ = (4 a²)/(15 λ)

And this equals 36.2 cm = 0.362 m.

So, (4 a²)/(15 λ) = 0.362

We can solve for λ.

Given that a = 0.8 mm = 0.8e-3 m.

So a² = (0.8e-3)^2 = 0.64e-6 m².

Plugging into the equation:

(4 * 0.64e-6) / (15 λ) ) = 0.362

Calculate numerator: 4 * 0.64e-6 = 2.56e-6

So, 2.56e-6 / (15 λ) ) = 0.362

Multiply both sides by 15 λ:

2.56e-6 = 0.362 * 15 * λ

0.362 *15 = 5.43

So,

2.56e-6 =5.43 λ → λ = 2.56e-6 /5.43 ≈ (2.56 /5.43 )e-6 m.

Calculating 2.56 /5.43: 2.56 ÷5.43 ≈ 0.471.

So λ ≈ 0.471e-6 m, which is 471 nm. Wait, but looking at the options, the wavelengths are around 400 to 500 nm. Wait, 471 nm isn't one of the exact options, but let's see.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check the setup.

Wait, the bright spots occur when N = m + 1/2, where N = (a²)/(λ D). So for the m-th bright spot, N = m + 1/2.

So for the first bright spot, m=1, N=3/2 → D1 = (2 a²)/(3 λ)
Second bright spot, m=2, N=5/2 → D2 = (2 a²)/(5 λ)
So D1 - D2 = (2 a²)/(3λ) - (2 a²)/(5λ) = (2 a²)(5 -3)/(15 λ) ) = (2 a² *2)/(15 λ) )= (4 a²)/(15 λ) ) → same as before.

So calculation is correct, leading to λ ≈ 471 nm.

Looking at the options, let's see the possible answers.

Looking for the wavelength for the bright spot being around 470 nm. The options are:

Option A: 1.25e-6 m → 1250 nm, which is infrared. Not possible.

Option B: 1.17e-6 → 1170 nm, no.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait a minute. My calculation gives λ ≈ 471e-9 meters, which is 471 nm. But looking at the options, the first parts of the options are in 1e-6 m, which is 1000 nm. So wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's recheck the calculation.

Given a = 0.8 mm = 0.8e-3 m.

a^2 = (0.8e-3)^2 = 0.64e-6 m².

Then,

4 a^2 / (15 λ) ) = 0.362 m.

So,

4 * 0.64e-6 = 2.56e-6.

So,

2.56e-6 / (15 λ) ) = 0.362 → solving for λ:

λ = (2.56e-6) / (0.362 *15 )

Calculate denominator: 0.362 *15 = 5.43 → λ ≈ 2.56e-6 /5.43 ≈ 4.71e-7 m → 471e-9 m → 471 nm.

But looking at the options, none of the first parts (wavelength for bright spot) is 471 nm. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: bright 1.25e-6 m → 1250 nm.

B:1.17e-6 → 1170 nm.

C:1.5e-6 → 1500 nm.

D:1.3e-6 →1300.

E:1.4e-6 →1400.

F:1.0e-6 →1000.

G:1.3e-6 →1300.

H:1.2e-6 →1200.

I:1.1e-6 →1100.

J:1.15e-6 →1150.

Wait, none are around 470 nm. So I must have done something wrong.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe the number of Fresnel zones isn't the approach here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem refers to the number of dark rings in the diffraction pattern, which relates to the distance.

Wait another approach: The position of the bright and dark spots in the center can be determined by the condition when moving the screen. The condition for a bright spot is when the screen is at a distance D where D = (a²)/( (m - ½ ) λ ), and for dark spots, D = (a²)/(m λ ), where m is an integer.

So for the first bright spot, m=1 → D = a²/( (1 - ½ ) λ ) = 2 a² / λ.

Wait, that's different from what I thought earlier. Hmm.

Wait, let me think again. The formula for the positions of the bright and dark spots in the central diffraction pattern can be given as:

For bright fringes: D = a²/( (m - ½ ) λ ), m = 1,2,3,...

For dark fringes: D = a²/( m λ ), m =1,2,3,...

So the first bright spot (m=1) occurs at D1 = a²/( (1 - ½ ) λ ) = 2 a² / λ.

The second bright spot (m=2) occurs at D2 = a²/( (2 - ½ ) λ ) = a²/( 1.5 λ ) = (2 a²)/(3 λ).

Wait, so the positions are D1 = 2a²/λ, D2=(2a²)/(3λ).

So the distance between D1 and D2 is D1 - D2 = (2a²/λ) - (2a²)/(3λ) ) = (4a²)/(3λ).

Wait, but according to the problem, when the screen is brought toward the aperture, the first bright spot occurs at D1, then the second bright spot occurs at D2, which is closer, so the distance between D1 and D2 is 36.2 cm.

So,

D1 - D2 = (2a²/λ) [1 - 1/3 ] = (2a²/λ) * (2/3) ) = (4 a²)/(3λ) ) 

Which equals 0.362 meters.

So,

(4 a²)/(3λ) ) = 0.362

Solving for λ:

λ = (4 a²) / (3 * 0.362 )

Given a=0.8e-3 m,

a²=0.64e-6 m²,

So,

λ = (4 * 0.64e-6) / (3 * 0.362 )

Calculate numerator:4 *0.64e-6 =2.56e-6.

Denominator:3 *0.362=1.086.

So,

λ = 2.56e-6 /1.086 ≈ approx 2.56 /1.086 → 2.36e-6 m → 2360 nm? That's in the infrared, but that's not making sense. Visible light is 400-700 nm.

Wait, this can't be right. I must have the formula wrong.

Alternative approach: Maybe using the Fresnel's approximation for the central spot. The condition for the central spot to be bright is when the phase change upon reflection causes constructive interference. Wait, perhaps a better approach is to think in terms of the number of half-period zones.

Wait, the central spot's brightness alternates as the screen moves. Each time a new half-period zone is included, the brightness flips. So the distance between two consecutive bright spots would correspond to moving a distance that brings in one more half-period.

Wait, the nth bright spot occurs when the number of half-period zones is n. So the condition is a² = (n) (λ D)/2.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused again. Let's look for another approach.

Another thought: The condition for the m-th bright spot at the center is given by D = (a²) / ( (m - 1/2) λ )

So for m=1 (first bright spot): D1 = a²/( (1- 0.5) λ )= 2 a²/λ.

For m=2: D2 = a²/(1.5 λ )= (2 a²)/(3 λ).

So the distance between D1 and D2 is D1 - D2 = (2 a²/λ) - (2 a²)/(3 λ) )= 4 a²/(3 λ).

And this equals 0.362 m (36.2 cm).

Plugging in a=0.8e-3 m,

4*(0.8e-3)^2/(3 λ) )=0.362.

Compute numerator:4*(0.64e-6)=2.56e-6.

So,

2.56e-6/(3 λ) )=0.362 → 2.56e-6 = 0.362 *3 λ → 2.56e-6=1.086 λ → λ=2.56e-6 /1.086 ≈ approx 2.36e-6 m → 2360 nm. That's way longer than visible light, which doesn't make sense.

Hmm, that's a problem. I must have the formula wrong. Let me try to find the correct condition.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the condition for dark spots. For a dark spot, the number of half-period zones should be an integer. So D = a²/(m λ ), where m is an integer.

So the first dark spot is at D = a²/λ.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing bright and dark spots. Let me think about Huygens' principle. The central spot is bright when an odd number of half-wavelength zones contribute. Each half-wavelength zone adds a phase shift of π, so an odd number would constructively interfere, while an even number would destructively interfere.

Wait, so the number of half-wavelength zones is given by N = (2 a²) / (λ D) )^(1/2) / (λ) ? No, wait, the number of half-wavelength zones in the aperture is N = (a² )/( (λ D)/2 ). So N = 2 a²/(λ D).

So when N is an integer, the contributions add up destructively (dark spot), and when N is a half-integer, they add constructively (bright spot). 

So for the m-th bright spot, N = m + ½ → 2 a²/(λ D) )= m + ½ → D = 2 a²/( (m + ½ ) λ )

So for the first bright spot, m=1: D1 = 2 a²/( (3/2 ) λ )= (4 a²)/(3 λ )

Wait, no, wait: for m=1, it's N=1 + ½= 3/2. So D1 = 2 a^2/( (3/2) λ )= (4 a^2)/(3 λ )

Similarly, for the second bright spot, m=2: N=2 + ½ =5/2 → D2= 2 a^2/( (5/2) λ )= (4 a^2)/(5 λ )

So the difference D1 - D2 = (4 a²)/(3 λ ) - (4 a²)/(5 λ )= 4 a² (5 -3)/(15 λ )= (8 a² )/(15 λ )

Set this equal to 0.362 m:

(8 a²)/(15 λ )=0.362 → λ=8 a²/(15 *0.362 )

Compute a=0.8e-3 → a²=0.64e-6.

So,

λ=8 *0.64e-6 / (15 *0.362 )

Compute denominator
