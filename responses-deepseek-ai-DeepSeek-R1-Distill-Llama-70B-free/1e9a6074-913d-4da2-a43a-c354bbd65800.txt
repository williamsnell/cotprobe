Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"I know that whenever the subject has occurred in conversation where I have been present, it has appeared to be the opinion of every one that we could not be taxed by a Parliament wherein we were not represented. But the payment of duties laid by an act of Parliament as regulations of commerce was never disputed. . . . An external tax is a duty laid on commodities imported; that duty is added to the first cost and other charges on the commodity, and, when it is offered for sale, makes a part of the price. If the people do not like it at that price, they refuse it; they are not obliged to pay it. But an internal tax is forced from the people without their consent if not laid by their own representatives. The Stamp Act says we shall have no commerce, make no exchange of property with each other, neither purchase nor grant, nor recover debts; we shall neither marry nor make our wills, unless we pay such and such sums; and thus it is intended to extort our money from us or ruin us by the consequence of refusing to pay it."

Okay, so I've got this question about Benjamin Franklin and a policy he's talking about. Let me try to break it down. The question is asking what policy Franklin described led to which event. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I'll read the passage carefully. Franklin is speaking before Parliament in 1766. He's discussing taxes and the distinctions between external and internal taxes. He mentions that external taxes, like duties on imported goods, weren't disputed because people could choose not to buy the goods if they didn't like the price. But internal taxes, which are forced without consent, are a problem. He specifically talks about the Stamp Act, which he says would prevent people from conducting normal commerce unless they pay certain sums, essentially extorting money from them.

Wait, the question is about the policy described leading to something. The options include the American Revolution, the Stamp Act itself, and other historical events. So, the passage is about the policy of the Stamp Act and how it's an internal tax that the colonies oppose.

So, what was the immediate result of the Stamp Act? Well, the Stamp Act was one of the key causes leading to the American Revolution. It was part of the taxation without representation issue that angered the colonies. So, the policy Franklin is describing (the Stamp Act) led to the American Revolution.

Looking at the options, option A is the American Revolution, which seems to fit. Option F is the introduction of the Stamp Act, but wait, the passage is explaining the policy that led to something else, not the introduction of the Stamp Act itself because the Stamp Act was already in place. So the question is about the consequence of that policy.

So the answer should be A: the American Revolution.

The policy described by Benjamin Franklin, which refers to the Stamp Act and the issue of internal taxation without representation, was a significant factor leading to the American Revolution. The passage explains how the Stamp Act imposed internal taxes that the colonies found unacceptable, contributing to the growing tensions that eventually resulted in the Revolution.

Answer: A
