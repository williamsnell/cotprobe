Okay, so I've got this problem about Mr. Golden buying three bonds. Each bond has a maturity value of $1,000. For each bond, he gets $15 semiannually for 20 years, and then the $1,000 at the end. The interest rates on the bonds are 3%, 4%, and 3.6%. I need to figure out how much he paid for each bond.

Hmm, wait. So each bond is the same in terms of payments and maturity, but different interest rates. The question is asking about the present value of each bond, right? Because the price he paid would be the present value of all the future cash flows.

So each bond makes 15 dollars every six months for 20 years. Oh wait, 20 years times 2 payments a year is 40 periods. And then a lump sum of 1000 at the end, which is at period 40.

The formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity is P = PMT * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n)/r]. And the present value of the lump sum would be 1000 / (1 + r)^40. Then both parts need to be added together.

Wait, but wait. The payment is $15 semiannually. So each period is 6 months, and the annual interest rate is given. So to get the periodic interest rate, I should divide the annual rate by 2.

Let me think. For each bond, the steps would be:

1. Calculate the present value of the annuity (the 15 payments each period).
2. Calculate the present value of the 1000 maturity value.
3. Sum the two for the total present value (bond price).

So for each bond, I'll compute both parts.

Let's go through each bond one by one.

First bond: 3% annual interest. So semiannual rate is 1.5% or 0.015.

Annuity part: PMT is 15. Number of periods n is 40.

PV annuity = 15 * [1 - (1 + 0.015)^-40 ] / 0.015

I need to compute (1.015)^-40. Let me think, what's 1.015^40? Well, let's see, but since it's raised to -40, it's 1/(1.015^40). Alternatively, maybe using the formula for present value.

Alternatively, using the formula step by step:

Calculate (1.015)^40. Let me approximate. Since 1.015^40 is approximately e^(0.015*40) = e^0.6 ≈ 1.8221, but wait wait, that's the continuous compounding approximation. But since it's semiannual, maybe a better way is to compute it step by step. Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that (1 + r)^n for small r and large n can be approximated, but perhaps it's better to think in terms of using a financial calculator approach here.

Alternatively, maybe I should just compute each step carefully.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the present value of each part.

Wait, another thought: the total payment is 15 each period, for 40 periods. So the annuity is an ordinary annuity because payments are at the end of each period.

So for the first bond, r = 0.03 annual → 0.015 semiannual.

Annuity PV = 15 * [1 - (1 + 0.015)^-40 ] / 0.015

Let me compute (1.015)^40. Let me calculate that. 1.015^40. Let's compute it step by step. Or perhaps I can use logarithms or known values.

Wait, 1.015^40 is approximately 2.2665 (since I remember that ln(2)≈0.693, and 40 * ln(1.015)=40 * 0.0148 ≈ 0.592 → e^0.592≈1.807. Hmm, maybe that's not precise enough. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it as (1.015)^40.

Alternatively, perhaps I should just accept that I need to compute this numerically, but since I'm doing this manually, maybe I'll proceed with approximate values.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate 1.015^40. Let me compute it in steps.

1.015^2 = 1.030225.

1.015^4 = (1.030225)^2 ≈ 1.06136.

1.015^8 = (1.06136)^2 ≈ 1.12618.

1.015^16 = (1.12618)^2 ≈ 1.2690.

1.015^32 = (1.2690)^2 ≈ 1.612.

Wait, but 40 is 32 + 8, so 1.015^40 = 1.612 * 1.12618 ≈ 1.612 * 1.126 ~ 1.815.

So (1.015)^40 ≈ 1.815. Therefore, (1.015)^-40 ≈ 1/1.815 ≈ 0.5513.

So the annuity factor: [1 - 0.5513 ] / 0.015 → (0.4487) / 0.015 ≈ 29.913.

Multiply by 15: 15 * 29.913 ≈ 448.7.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check that 1.015^40 is about 1.815. Maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps using a better approach. Let me try to compute 1.015^40.

I think the exact value is approximately 2.19, but I'm not sure. Wait, another approach: using the rule of 72. 72/1.5 = 48, so in 48 periods (24 years), the money doubles. So 40 periods is a bit less than that. So 1.015^40 is about 2 times (1.015)^(40-24*2)= 40-48 is negative, that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach. But since I don't have a calculator, I'll proceed with the approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps for the purposes of this problem, the exact value isn't needed, and the options will be such that the correct present value can be determined.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the present value of each part using more precise calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed with the formula for each.

So for the first bond:

r = 3%, semiannual rate is 1.5%.

Annuity:

PV = 15 * [1 - (1 + 0.015)^-40 ] / 0.015

Let me compute (1.015)^40 precisely.

Wait, perhaps I can compute it as e^(0.015 *40) but that's continuous, so not exactly correct, but perhaps a better approximation.

0.015 *40 = 0.6. e^0.6 ≈ 1.8221. So (1.015)^40 ≈ 1.8221. So (1.015)^-40 ≈ 0.5498.

Thus:

[1 - 0.5498 ] = 0.4502.

Divided by 0.015 → 0.4502 / 0.015 ≈ 30.013.

Multiply by 15: 15 * 30.013 ≈ 450.2.

So annuity PV is approximately $450.20.

Now, the present value of the $1000 at period 40:

PV = 1000 / (1.015)^40 ≈ 1000 * 0.5498 ≈ 549.8.

So total present value is 450.2 + 549.8 ≈ 1000. So approximately $1000. So for the 3% bond, the price is about $1000.

Wait, but let me check again. Because when the coupon rate equals the market rate, the bond sells at face value. Wait, but in this case, the coupon payment is $15 semiannually. So the annual coupon is $30. The face value is $1000.

So coupon rate is 30/1000 = 3%. Oh wait! So for the first bond, the coupon rate is 3%, which matches the market rate of 3%. So the bond should sell at face value, which is $1000. So that explains why the present value is $1000. So that's a good check.

So the first bond (3% interest) is priced at $1000. So looking at the options, let's see which ones have 1000 for the first bond.

Looking at the options:

Option E: 1,000.00, $860.23, $910.26

Option H: 1,000.04, $865.23, $915.26

Option B: 1,000.04, $863.23, $915.26 

Wait, Option E is 1,000.00 for the first bond. Option H and B have 1,000.04, which is very close to 1000.

Hmm, but given that when the coupon rate equals the market rate, the bond should be at face value. So perhaps the correct present value is exactly 1000, so E or perhaps H, but the numbers are very close.

Wait, but let's proceed to calculate the other bonds to see which option matches.

Now, the second bond has a 4% interest rate. So semiannual rate is 2% (0.02).

So the coupon rate is 3% (as before), so 3% < 4%, so the bond is selling at a discount.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the coupon rate is 3% (annual coupon of 30), and the market rate is 4%, so the bond is priced below face value.

So let's compute the present value.

Annuity part: 15 per period, 40 periods, r=0.02.

So the annuity factor is [1 - (1.02)^-40 ] / 0.02.

Compute (1.02)^40. Let me approximate this. 1.02^40 is approximately e^(0.02*40)=e^0.8≈2.2255. So (1.02)^40 ≈ 2.2255 → (1.02)^-40 ≈ 0.4564.

So annuity factor: [1 - 0.4564]/0.02 → 0.5436 / 0.02 = 27.18.

Multiply by 15: 15 * 27.18 = 407.7.

Present value of the $1000: 1000 / (1.02)^40 ≈ 1000 * 0.4564 ≈ 456.4.

Total present value: 407.7 + 456.4 = 864.1.

So approximately $864.10. Looking at the options, for the 4% bond, the price is around $863 or $860, etc.

Looking at the options:

Option E: 1,000.00, 860.23, 910.26

Option B: 1,000.04, $863.23, $915.26

Option C: 1,000.04, $860.23, $910.26

Option H: 1,000.04, $865.23, $915.26

So my approximation for the 4% bond is about $864.10, which is close to 863.23 in option B, or 860.23 in C and E.

Hmmm. But let's compute it more accurately.

Let me compute (1.02)^40 more precisely.

Calculating step by step:

1.02^1 = 1.02

1.02^2 = 1.0404

1.02^4 = (1.0404)^2 ≈ 1.0820.

1.02^8 ≈ (1.0820)^2 ≈ 1.1699.

1.02^16 ≈ (1.1699)^2 ≈ 1.3698.

1.02^32 ≈ (1.3698)^2 ≈ 1.8771.

1.02^40 = 1.8771 * (1.02)^8 → 1.8771 * 1.1699 ≈ approx 2.194.

So (1.02)^40 ≈ 2.194 → (1.02)^-40 ≈ 1/2.194 ≈ 0.4556.

So the annuity factor is [1 - 0.4556]/0.02 → 0.5444 / 0.02 = 27.22.

15 * 27.22 = 408.3.

PV of 1000: 1000 * 0.4556 ≈ 455.6.

Total: 408.3 + 455.6 = 863.9, so approximately $863.90.

Looking at the options, option B has 863.23 for the second bond, and option C has 860.23, option E 860.23.

Hmm, so perhaps my approximation is a bit off. Alternatively, perhaps a more accurate calculation is needed.

Wait, maybe I should use the precise formula for present value without approximating. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the TVM formula more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute each part more accurately.

Compute (1.02)^40:

Let me compute it more accurately. Let me use logarithms.

ln(1.02) ≈ 0.0198026.

40 * ln(1.02) ≈ 40 * 0.0198026 ≈ 0.7921.

e^0.7921 ≈ 2.207.

So (1.02)^40 ≈ 2.207 → so (1.02)^-40 ≈ 0.4533.

So annuity factor: (1 - 0.4533)/0.02 → 0.5467 / 0.02 = 27.335.

Multiply by 15: 15 * 27.335 ≈ 410.03.

PV of 1000: 1000 * 0.4533 ≈ 453.3.

Total PV: 410.03 + 453.3 = 863.33.

So approximately $863.33. So the closest option is B, which has $863.23.

So the second bond is approximately $863.23.

Now, the third bond has an interest rate of 3.6%, so semiannual rate is 1.8% (0.018).

So coupon rate is 3% (as before), so 3% < 3.6%, so the bond is selling at a discount.

Compute the present value.

Annuity part: 15 * [1 - (1.018)^-40 ] / 0.018.

Compute (1.018)^40.

Again, using logarithms:

ln(1.018) ≈ 0.01783.

40 * 0.01783 ≈ 0.7132.

e^0.7132 ≈ 2.041.

So (1.018)^40 ≈ 2.041 → (1.018)^-40 ≈ 0.4918.

So annuity factor: (1 - 0.4918)/0.018 → 0.5082 / 0.018 ≈ 28.233.

Multiply by 15: 15 * 28.233 ≈ 423.495 ≈ 423.50.

PV of 1000: 1000 * 0.4918 ≈ 491.8.

Total PV: 423.5 + 491.8 ≈ 915.3.

So approximately $915.30.

Looking at the options, for the third bond, option B has $915.26, which is close. Option E has 910.26, option C has 910.26.

So now, putting it all together:

Bond 1 (3%): ~$1000.00

Bond 2 (4%): ~$863.23

Bond 3 (3.6%): ~$915.26

Looking at the options, which one matches this?

Looking at option E: 1,000.00, 860.23, 910.26.

Wait, our calculation for the third bond was ~915, but option E has 910 for the third. So that's a bit off.

Option B: 1,000.04, 863.23, 915.26. This matches our calculations.

Option H: 1,000.04, 865.23, 915.26. Close but the second bond is 865, which is a bit higher than our calculation.

Option C: 1,000.04, 860.23, 910.26 → third bond is lower than our calculation.

So option B seems to fit best: 1000.04, 863.23, 915.26.

Wait, but let me double-check the third bond's calculation more accurately.

Compute (1.018)^40 again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, 1.018 is the semiannual rate. So let me compute (1.018)^40 precisely.

Alternatively, using the exact calculation:

Let me compute 1.018^40.

Hmm, perhaps a step-by-step approach.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I can compute (1.018)^40 as follows:

We can compute it as e^(40 * ln(1.018)).

ln(1.018) ≈ 0.017831.

40 * 0.017831 ≈ 0.71324.

e^0.71324 ≈ 2.041. So (1.018)^40 ≈ 2.041, so the present value factor is 1/2.041 ≈ 0.4902.

So PV of 1000 is 1000 * 0.4902 = 490.2.

Annuity part: (1 - 0.4902)/0.018 = 0.5098 / 0.018 ≈ 28.3289.

Multiply by 15: 15 * 28.3289 ≈ 424.93.

Total PV: 424.93 + 490.2 ≈ 915.13.

So approximately $915.13. So option B's third bond is 915.26, which is very close.

So the three bonds' prices are approximately:

3% → $1000.00

4% → $863.23

3.6% → $915.26

Looking at the options, option B is:

$1,000.04, $863.23, $915.26.

Which matches closely.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check whether option E could be correct. Let me see.

Option E:

$1,000.00, $860.23, $910.26.

Wait, in our calculation, the 4% bond was approximately $863.33, and the 3.6% was $915.13. So option
