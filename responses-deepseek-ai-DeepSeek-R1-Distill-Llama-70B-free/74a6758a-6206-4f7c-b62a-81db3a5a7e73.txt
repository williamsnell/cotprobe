Okay, so I've got this problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to accounting and business calculations, so I need to think carefully.

Alright, the problem states that Ms. Susan Wane and Ms. Dolly Watson invested $35,000 and $20,000 respectively in a corkscrew factory. They agreed to share the profits equally, but each will first get 8% interest on their investment. The business earned $24,200, and I need to figure out how this income is distributed between them.

Hmm, so first, I think I should calculate the interest each gets. Since the interest is 8% of their investment, I can compute that.

For Susan, her investment is $35,000. So 8% of that is 0.08 * 35,000. Let me calculate that. 0.08 * 35,000 is $2,800. So Susan gets $2,800 as interest.

Dolly's investment is $20,000. So 8% of that is 0.08 * 20,000, which is $1,600. So Dolly gets $1,600 as interest.

Wait, but the total interest paid would be $2,800 + $1,600 = $4,400. Now, the business earned $24,200. So after paying out the interest, the remaining amount is the profit to be shared equally.

Let me subtract the total interest from the total income. So $24,200 - $4,400 = $19,800. That's the profit left to be split equally between them.

Since they're sharing the profits equally, each gets half of $19,800. Half of that is $9,900. So Susan gets $9,900 and Dolly gets $9,900 from the profit.

But wait, that's just the profit. So their total payout would be the interest plus their share of the profit.

So for Susan, she gets her interest of $2,800 plus $9,900, which totals $12,700. Dolly gets her $1,600 interest plus $9,900, which totals $11,500.

Looking at the options, option D says Ms. Wane receives $12,700 and Ms. Watson receives $11,500. That matches what I calculated.

Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Sometimes I mix up percentages, but in this case, 8% of each investment seems right. 35k at 8% is indeed 2800, and 20k is 1600. Adding those gives 4400 subtracted from 24200 gives 19800, split equally is 9900 each. Adding the interest, Susan has 2800+9900=12,700 and Dolly 1600+9900=11,500. Yep, that's correct.

So the correct answer should be option D.

To determine the distribution of income between Ms. Susan Wane and Ms. Dolly Watson, we first calculate the interest each receives on their investments. 

1. **Interest Calculation**:  
   - Ms. Susan Wane invested $35,000 at 8%, so her interest is:  
     \[
     0.08 \times 35,000 = \$2,800  
     \]  
   - Ms. Dolly Watson invested $20,000 at 8%, so her interest is:  
     \[
     0.08 \times 20,000 = \$1,600  
     \]  

2. **Total Interest Paid**:  
   The total interest paid to both is:  
   \[
   \$2,800 + \$1,600 = \$4,400  
   \]  

3. **Profit After Interest**:  
   The business earned $24,200. After paying the total interest, the remaining profit to be shared equally is:  
   \[
   \$24,200 - \$4,400 = \$19,800  
   \]  

4. **Profit Sharing**:  
   Since the profit is shared equally, each partner receives:  
   \[
   \frac{\$19,800}{2} = \$9,900  
   \]  

5. **Total Distribution**:  
   - Ms. Susan Wane receives her interest plus her share of the profit:  
     \[
     \$2,800 + \$9,900 = \$12,700  
     \]  
   - Ms. Dolly Watson receives her interest plus her share of the profit:  
     \[
     \$1,600 + \$9,900 = \$11,500  
     \]  

Thus, Ms. Wane receives $12,700 and Ms. Watson receives $11,500.

**Correct Answer: D**
