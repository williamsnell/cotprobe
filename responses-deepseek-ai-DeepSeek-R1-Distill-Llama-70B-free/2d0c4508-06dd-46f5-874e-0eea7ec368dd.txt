Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about tertiary prevention in a school setting. I'm a bit rusty on my prevention levels, so I'll need to think this through carefully.

First, I remember that prevention is generally categorized into three levels: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Let me try to recall what each means.

Primary prevention is about preventing problems before they occur. It's like the "ounce of prevention" saying. So things like educating students on healthy habits, anti-bullying programs, or teaching coping skills to everyone. The goal is to stop issues from arising in the first place.

Secondary prevention focuses on early detection and intervention. It's for when a problem has just started or is at an early stage. This might include things like screening for issues, identifying at-risk students, or providing initial counseling. The idea is to catch problems early so they don't become more serious.

Tertiary prevention, then, must be about managing and treating existing, more serious problems. It's for when a problem is already present and needs intervention to prevent it from getting worse or to help manage it. So this would involve more targeted, intensive support for students who are already dealing with significant issues.

Now, looking at the question: which option is tertiary prevention in a school setting? Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: Large-group programs on self-esteem. That sounds like primary prevention because it's aimed at all students to build a positive trait.

Option B: Mandatory health screenings. This seems like secondary prevention because it's about early detection of health issues.

Option C: School-wide campaigns for healthy eating. Again, primary prevention since it's promoting general health for everyone.

Option D: Small-group counseling for students affected by divorce. Divorce can cause significant stress. If the students are in the initial stages, maybe this is secondary, helping them early on. But I'm not sure yet.

Option E: Teacher-parent meetings. That's more about monitoring and support, maybe secondary or primary depending on the context, but probably not tertiary.

Option F: Individual counseling for students returning from institutional care. That sounds more intensive and individualized, which fits tertiary since the student has already been through a serious situation.

Option G: Career guidance for unsure students. That's more of a supportive measure, perhaps primary or secondary depending on if it's preventing issues.

Option H: Seminars on drug and alcohol dangers. Primary prevention, as it's educational for all.

Option I: School-wide anti-bullying programs. Primary, as it's aimed at preventing bullying before it happens.

Option J: Physical education for all. Definitely primary, promoting physical health.

So, the key is to find the option that's dealing with existing, more severe issues. Option F is individual counseling for students who've been in institutional care. That suggests they've experienced significant challenges and need more personalized, intensive support. So that's tertiary.

Option D is small-group counseling for those affected by divorce's initial stages. That sounds like secondary because it's early intervention.

So the correct answer should be F.

The correct answer is F. Tertiary prevention focuses on managing and treating existing, severe issues. Option F involves individual counseling for students resuming from institutional care, indicating a need for intensive support, which aligns with tertiary prevention.

Answer: F
