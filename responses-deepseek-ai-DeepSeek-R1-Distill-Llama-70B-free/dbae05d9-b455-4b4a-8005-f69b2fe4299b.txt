This question refers to the following information.
"MAHATMA GANDHI'S MESSAGE.
REMAIN NON-VIOLENT
The following message was sent by Mahatma Gandhi from Waltair:—
Maulana Mohamed AH was arrested at Waltair under sections 107 and 108 to be called upon to give security, to be of good behaviour for one year. The place and date of trial is unknown.
The Begum Saheba and Mr. Hayat were permitted to see him after arrest.
He and I were going to address a meeting outside the station. He was arrested. I continued going to the meeting and addressed them. There is no cause for sorrow, but every cause for congratulation. There should be no hartal. Perfect peace and calmness should be observed. I regard the arrest as a prelude to Swaraj and the redress of the Khilafat and the Punjab wrongs, if we can remain non-violent. Retain Hindu-Muslim Unity despite the madness of some Moplahs, and fulfil the Swadeshi programme.
I hope every Indian, man or woman, will completely boycott foreign cloth and take up spinning or weaving during every spare minute.
By striving like the Maulana, be insistent on religious and national rights.
Let us earn imprisonment. I am conscious of the Maulana's innocence and I am sure the imprisonment of the innocent will enable the nation to reach the cherished goal."
Mohandas Gandhi, The Pilgrims' March, 1921

Okay, so I've got this history question to tackle, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question refers to a message from Mahatma Gandhi where he's talking about boycotting foreign cloth. Specifically, the fifth paragraph mentions boycotting foreign cloth and taking up spinning or weaving. The question is asking which historical development from 1450–1750 C.E. inspired this instruction.

First, I need to understand the context of Gandhi's message. He's promoting self-reliance and Swadeshi, which was a key part of India's independence movement. The Swadeshi movement encouraged Indians to use domestically produced goods, especially cloth, instead of relying on foreign, particularly British, goods. This was a strategy to weaken British economic control over India.

Now, the question is about the historical developments between 1450 and 1750 that inspired this. I should think about what events or movements during that period might have influenced such economic strategies.

Looking at the options:

A: The spread of the Black Death in Europe – This led to significant demographic changes in Europe, but I don't see a direct link to Gandhi's boycott.

B: The discovery of the New World by Columbus – This opened up trade routes and resources for Europe, which might relate to global trade but not directly to Gandhi's movement.

C: The conquest of India by rival Muslim empires – India was conquered by various empires, but how does this relate to boycotting foreign cloth?

D: The rise of absolute monarchies in Europe – This is more about political structures in Europe, not directly related to economic policies in India.

E: The invention of the printing press – While important for spreading ideas, not directly related to cloth boycotts.

F: The Scientific Revolution – Again, more about scientific advancements, not economic policies.

G: The importation of food crops from the New World – This affected agriculture and demographics, but not directly related to cloth.

H: The Protestant Reformation – Religious changes in Europe, not directly related to India's economic strategies.

I: The African slave trade – This was part of the triangular trade system but again not directly connected to Gandhi's boycott.

J: The development of joint-stock companies – Hmm, joint-stock companies were crucial in the establishment of European trading companies like the British East India Company. These companies played a significant role in colonizing India and controlling its economy, including the textile industry.

Wait, let me think more. The British East India Company was a joint-stock company that eventually became the ruler of India. Their exploitation of India's resources, including forcing the production of raw materials and importing finished goods, led to economic drain. So, the Swadeshi movement was a response to this economic exploitation, encouraging self-sufficiency and rejecting foreign goods, especially cloth.

So, the development of joint-stock companies (option J) would have been the inspiration because these companies were the instruments through which foreign powers exerted economic control over India, leading to movements like Swadeshi to counteract that control.

Alternatively, looking at the options, option C is about conquest by Muslim empires. While India was under Mughal rule during that period, which was a Muslim empire, I'm not sure how that directly ties to Gandhi's call for boycotting foreign cloth. The Mughals were an earlier empire, and while their rule influenced India's history, the specific economic boycott seems more tied to British colonial policies facilitated by joint-stock companies.

So, putting it together, the correct answer should be J: The development of joint-stock companies.

The question asks which historical development from 1450–1750 C.E. inspired Mahatma Gandhi's instruction to boycott foreign cloth. Gandhi's message was part of the Swadeshi movement, which aimed to promote self-reliance and reduce dependence on foreign goods, particularly British textiles. This movement was a response to the economic exploitation by British colonial powers, facilitated by joint-stock companies like the British East India Company. These companies played a crucial role in controlling India's economy, including the textile industry, leading to the Swadeshi movement's emphasis on boycotting foreign cloth and promoting domestic production.

Analyzing the options, the development of joint-stock companies (option J) is the most relevant, as these entities were instrumental in establishing and maintaining colonial economic control over India, which directly influenced Gandhi's call for economic self-reliance.

Answer: J
