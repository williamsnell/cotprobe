Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So, the question presents two statements about group homomorphisms, and I need to determine if each is true or false. Then, based on that, I'll select the correct option from A to J.

First, let's break down Statement 1: "For any two groups G and G', there exists a homomorphism of G into G'." Hmm, I remember that a homomorphism is a function between two groups that preserves the group operation. So, for any two groups, does there always exist at least one homomorphism from one to the other?

Wait, I think about the simplest case. Let's say G is any group and G' is the trivial group containing just the identity element. Then, the trivial homomorphism maps every element of G to the identity in G'. So that's one example where a homomorphism exists. But does this hold for any two groups, regardless of their structure?

What if G is a non-abelian group and G' is abelian? Well, the identity map is only possible if G is isomorphic to G', but we're talking about any two groups. Oh wait, no, the statement doesn't say it's an isomorphism. It just says a homomorphism exists. So even if G is non-abelian and G' is abelian, I can still define a trivial homomorphism. Or perhaps a non-trivial one if possible.

Wait, but can I always find a non-trivial homomorphism? Like, for example, if G is cyclic and G' has the same order, there's a homomorphism, but if G' has a different order, maybe not? But the statement is about existence, not about being non-trivial. So as long as there's at least one homomorphism, even the trivial one, then Statement 1 is true.

Wait, but if G is any group and G' is another group, then the trivial map that sends every element of G to the identity in G' is indeed a homomorphism. Because for any a, b in G, f(ab) = e_{G'}, and f(a)f(b) = e_{G'} e_{G'} = e_{G'}, so it works. So regardless of G and G', the trivial homomorphism exists. So Statement 1 must be true.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Suppose G is an infinite group and G' is finite. Then the trivial homomorphism still exists. So yes, Statement 1 is true.

Now, Statement 2: "Every homomorphism is a one-to-one map." Hmm, no, that doesn't sound right. A one-to-one map is an injective function, meaning that if f(a) = f(b), then a must equal b. But homomorphisms can have kernels, which are the elements of G mapping to the identity in G'. So if the kernel has more than one element, the homomorphism isn't injective.

For example, consider the homomorphism from Z (integers under addition) to Z_2Z (integers mod 2). This maps even numbers to 0 and odd to 1. The kernel is all even integers, which is an infinite set. So this homomorphism is not one-to-one. Therefore, Statement 2 is false.

So now evaluating the options:

Statement 1 is True, Statement 2 is False.

Looking at the options, option D says "True, False." So the answer should be D.
</think>

Statement 1: For any two groups \( G \) and \( G' \), there exists a homomorphism of \( G \) into \( G' \).  
This is true because the trivial homomorphism, which maps every element of \( G \) to the identity element of \( G' \), always exists. This satisfies the condition for a homomorphism, as \( f(ab) = f(a)f(b) \) holds for all \( a, b \in G \).

Statement 2: Every homomorphism is a one-to-one map.  
This is false. A homomorphism is not necessarily injective (one-to-one). For example, the kernel of a homomorphism can contain more than one element, meaning multiple elements in \( G \) map to the identity in \( G' \). This violates injectivity.

Given the evaluation of the statements, the correct option is **D: True, False**.

Answer: D
