Okay, so I've got this economics question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by understanding what the question is asking. The question is about Say's Law and which school of economists defended it, and also which prominent economist disputed this theory.

First, I should recall what Say's Law is. From what I remember, Say's Law is an economic principle that states "supply creates its own demand." It suggests that when a good is produced, it generates income in the economy equal to the value of that good, which then can be used to purchase other goods and services. So, in essence, Say's Law argues against the possibility of general overproduction and says that there can't be a lack of demand overall because supply and demand are inherently linked.

Now, the question is asking which school of economists defended Say's Law. I think the classical school of economics is associated with this. Classical economists like Jean-Baptiste Say (from whom the law gets its name), David Ricardo, and others supported this idea. They believed that markets naturally tend towards full employment and that there's no possibility of a general glut.

Next, the question asks which prominent economist disputed this theory. I remember that John Maynard Keynes was a major critic of Say's Law. Keynes argued that Say's Law doesn't hold true in the short run because individuals can choose to save or hoard money, leading to situations where aggregate demand is insufficient to meet aggregate supply. This was a key part of Keynesian economics, particularly in his work "The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money," where he addressed the Great Depression and how classical theories like Say's Law were inadequate in explaining such economic crises.

Looking at the answer options, I need to match the school that defended Say's Law and the economist who disputed it. Let's go through the options:

A: Chicago school, Stiglitz. Chicago school is more associated with monetarism and free-market ideas, not directly with Say's Law. Stiglitz is a modern economist known for his work on information asymmetry, but I'm not sure he's the one who primarily disputed Say's Law.

B: Marxist school, Minsky. Marxists have their own critiques of capitalism, but I don't think they're the ones who directly opposed Say's Law. Minsky is known for his financial instability hypothesis.

C: Behavioral school, Akerlof. Behavioral economics is more about how psychological factors influence decisions, not directly related to Say's Law. Akerlof is known for the concept of lemons in markets.

D: Neoclassical school, Friedman. Neoclassicals do follow some classical ideas, but Friedman was a monetarist, part of the Chicago school. Not sure if he's the main disputing figure here.

E: Neoclassical school, Coase. Coase is known for his work on the Coase theorem and transaction costs, unrelated to this.

F: Classical school, Keynes. Wait, the classical school defended Say's Law, and Keynes disputed it. So this option says Classical school defended, and Keynes disputed. That fits exactly what I was thinking.

G: Supply-side school, Krugman. Supply-side is a different school, and Krugman is a Keynesian, but he's modern, not the primary historical figure who disputed Say's Law.

H: Austrian school, Keynes. The Austrian school is different, more into free markets and different from classical in some ways. Keynes did dispute Say's Law, but the school here is wrong.

I: Keynesian school, Hayek. Hayek was an Austrian economist, and Keynesian school is the one that disputes classical ideas, but this option is reversed. The defender would be classical, not Keynesian.

J: Monetarist school, Samuelson. Monetarists are more about monetary policy, Samuelson is a Keynesian economist.

So the correct option should be F: Classical school defended Say's Law, and Keynes disputed it.

The question asks which school of economists defended Say's Law and which prominent economist disputed it. Say's Law states that "supply creates its own demand," implying that markets naturally tend toward full employment and that general overproduction is impossible. The classical school of economists, including figures like Jean-Baptiste Say and David Ricardo, defended this principle. However, John Maynard Keynes famously disputed Say's Law, arguing that aggregate demand could fall short of aggregate supply due to factors like saving and hoarding, particularly in his work "The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money."

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, C, D, E, G, H, I, J**: These options either misidentify the school defending Say's Law or the economist disputing it.
- **F**: Correctly identifies the classical school as defenders of Say's Law and Keynes as the prominent economist who disputed it.

Thus, the correct answer is **F: Classical school, Keynes**.

Answer: F
