Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about partnership taxation. Hmm, let's see. The question is about whether the partnership terminated for tax purposes when one partner sold his interest.

Alright, the setup: On January 1st, the partners' interests in Studio Partnership were Ross 15%, Stone 35%, and Taylor 50%. Then on April 9th, Stone sold his entire interest to Taylor. The question is asking which statement is correct regarding Studio's status as a partnership for tax purposes.

I remember that under the Internal Revenue Code, specifically Section 708, a partnership is treated as terminated if there's a sale or exchange of 50% or more of the total interests in the partnership within a 12-month period. So, when does this termination happen?

Wait, but in this case, Stone is selling his entire 35% interest to Taylor. So Taylor previously had 50%, and now after the sale, he's getting another 35%. So Taylor's total interest would be 85% after the sale. That's more than 50%. So does that mean the partnership is terminated?

Wait, no, wait. Because the 50% rule applies when there's a sale of 50% or more of the interests. But here, Stone is selling 35%, which is less than 50%. But wait, the sale is to Taylor, who already owned 50%. So after the sale, Taylor has 85%, which is more than 50% of the interests in the partnership.

Wait, but I think the key here is whether the sale causes a 50% change in ownership. Let me think again. The rule is that if within any 12-month period, there's a sale or exchange of 50% or more of the total interests, then the partnership is considered terminated. So in this case, Stone's 35% is being sold. So that's 35% of the interests being sold. Since 35% is less than 50%, does that mean the partnership isn't terminated?

But wait, what's the exact rule? Oh right, it's 50% or more of the total interests in the partnership. So if a partner sells 35%, that's less than 50%, so it doesn't trigger termination. So the partnership continues, and it's not terminated.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because when Taylor buys Stone's 35%, he ends up owning 85%. But the rule is about the transfer, not the resulting ownership. So the transfer is 35%, which is under 50%, so the partnership doesn't terminate. So the answer would be that the partnership did not terminate.

Looking at the options, option D says "Studio did not terminate." Option F says termination as of April 9. So if the sale is under 50%, D is correct.

But wait, what if the sale causes the new owner to have more than 50%? Does that affect anything? No, because the termination is based on the transfer of 50% or more interests, not the resulting ownership. So even if Taylor now has 85%, the sale was only 35% of the interests, so under 50%, so no termination.

Therefore, the correct answer should be D: Studio did not terminate.

Wait, but I think I might be mixing up two different concepts. One is the termination under Section 708, and the other is when a partnership continues but with a new partner. So, in this case, Stone is leaving, and Taylor is taking his place, but the partnership isn't terminated because the transfer was less than 50%. So the partnership continues without terminating.

So the correct answer is D.

The question revolves around whether Studio Partnership terminated for tax purposes when Stone sold his 35% interest to Taylor on April 9. Under Section 708 of the Internal Revenue Code, a partnership is treated as terminated if 50% or more of the total interests are sold or exchanged within a 12-month period. Here, Stone sold 35% of the interests, which is less than the 50% threshold. Therefore, the sale does not trigger a termination of the partnership. 

Although Taylor's ownership increases to 85% after the sale, the termination rule depends on the transfer itself, not the resulting ownership percentage. Since the transfer was less than 50%, the partnership continues without termination.

Among the options provided, the correct answer is:

D: Studio did not terminate.
