Okay, so I've got this question about Nathanson's views on criminals who commit murder and what right they forfeit. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it.

First, I remember that Nathanson wrote about capital punishment, right? He was a philosopher, I think. His arguments were in support of the death penalty, so I guess he had some specific reasoning about why it's justified.

Wait, the question is asking which right they forfeit. The options are privacy, respect, rehabilitation, dignity, free speech, humane treatment, personal property, freedom, fair trial, or life.

I think Nathanson's argument is based on the idea that by committing murder, the criminal gives up their right to life. Because murder is such a serious crime, the state has the right to take their life as punishment. That makes sense because capital punishment is the ultimate forfeiture of the right to life.

Let me consider the other options. Privacy? I don't think that's the main point here. Respect? Maybe, but that's more abstract. Rehabilitation programs? Well, some might argue that, but I'm not sure it's the primary right Nathanson focused on.

Dignity? Maybe, but again, the key is the right to life. Free speech doesn't seem relevant here. Humane treatment? Well, if they forfeit life, then perhaps they lose humane treatment, but I think the main point is the right to life itself.

Personal property? That doesn't seem central. Freedom? They do lose their freedom when they're imprisoned, but the question is about what they forfeit according to Nathanson. I think it's more about the right to life.

Fair trial? No, because they still get a trial; the forfeiture is after the trial. So putting it all together, the answer should be J: life.

The question asks which right criminals who commit murder forfeit according to Nathanson. Nathanson, a philosopher who supported capital punishment, argued that murderers lose their right to life as the ultimate punishment. Among the options, the most relevant is life, as it aligns with his stance on capital punishment.
