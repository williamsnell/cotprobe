Okay, so I've got this problem here about the compression factor of a gas. Hmm, I remember that the compression factor, Z, is a measure of how much a real gas deviates from ideal gas behavior. Right, the formula is Z = PV/(nRT), but wait, when comparing it to the ideal gas, maybe another approach is better.

The problem says the gas is at 250 K and 15 atm. The molar volume is 12% smaller than what the perfect gas law gives. Wait, perfect gas law is another term for ideal gas law, PV = nRT. So the ideal molar volume would be V_ideal = RT/P.

But wait, the actual molar volume is 12% smaller. So let's think: the real molar volume V_real = V_ideal - 12% of V_ideal. So that's 0.88 * V_ideal, because 100% -12% is 88%. So V_real = 0.88 V_ideal.

Wait, the compression factor Z is defined as V_real = Z * V_ideal. Oh wait no, wait. Let me think again. I might have it backwards. The compression factor is Z = V_real / V_ideal. Or is it the other way around? Hmm, I think I got that wrong before. Alternatively, sometimes it's defined as Z = (PV)/(nRT), which for ideal gas is 1. So if the gas is less voluminous than expected, Z would be less than 1.

Wait, what's the exact definition. Right, the compression factor Z is (molar volume of real gas) / (molar volume of ideal gas at same T and P). So Z = V_real / V_ideal. So if V_real is 12% smaller, that's 0.88 V_ideal. So Z = 0.88.

Wait, but let me make sure. Because another way, let's compute V_real. The ideal molar volume is (RT)/P. The real is 12% less, so V_real = 0.88 * (RT)/P.

So then, Z = V_real / V_ideal = 0.88 * (RT/P) / (RT/P) ) = 0.88. So yes, Z is 0.88.

Looking at the options, option H is 0.88. So the answer should be H.

Wait, but wait another way: sometimes I've seen the compression factor calculated as PV/(nRT), which is the same as Z. So for ideal gas, PV = nRT, so Z=1. So in this case, since the volume is lower, the pressure would be higher if the volume is lower at the same n and T? Or perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Wait, let's think about the ideal case. PV = nRT for ideal. So for real gas, PV = nRT * Z. So Z = PV/(nRT).

If the volume is lower than ideal, that would mean that at the same P and T, n is the same, but V_real is less than V_ideal. Or, for given P, V_real is less. Hmm, perhaps it's better to compute Z using the given data.

The problem states that the molar volume is 12% smaller. So V_real = 0.88 V_ideal. Since V_ideal = RT/P, then V_real = 0.88 (RT/P).

So then, Z = V_real / V_ideal = 0.88 (RT/P) / (RT/P) ) = 0.88. So that's correct.

Therefore, the compression factor is 0.88, which is option H.

The compression factor \( Z \) is defined as the ratio of the molar volume of a real gas to the molar volume of an ideal gas under the same conditions, i.e., \( Z = \frac{V_{\text{real}}}{V_{\text{ideal}}} \). For an ideal gas, \( Z = 1 \).

The problem states that the molar volume of the gas is 12% smaller than that calculated from the ideal gas law. This means:

\[
V_{\text{real}} = V_{\text{ideal}} - 0.12 \cdot V_{\text{ideal}} = 0.88 \cdot V_{\text{ideal}}
\]

Substituting this into the definition of \( Z \):

\[
Z = \frac{V_{\text{real}}}{V_{\text{ideal}}} = \frac{0.88 \cdot V_{\text{ideal}}}{V_{\text{ideal}}} = 0.88
\]

Thus, the compression factor under these conditions is \( Z = 0.88 \).

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**H: 0.88**

Answer: H
