Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the urinary system. Hmm, I need to figure out which structure collects urine in the body. Let me think about what I remember from biology class.

The question gives options A through J, each a different organ or structure. The options are Bladder, Ureter, Spleen, Urethra, Renal Vein, Renal Artery, Gallbladder, Prostate, Liver, and Kidney.

Wait, I remember that the kidneys are the organs that actually make urine. They filter blood and produce urine, right? But the question is about where urine is collected, not produced. So the kidneys produce it, but where does it go next?

Oh right, the urine flows from the kidneys through the ureters. The ureters are these tubes that carry the urine away. But they don't collect it; they transport it. So the next structure after the ureter must be where it's stored until it's expelled.

So the bladder is the organ that stores urine. It's like a sac that holds the urine until you're ready to urinate. Then, when you go to the bathroom, the urine leaves the bladder through the urethra. So the urethra is the tube that carries it out of the body.

Wait, but the question is specifically about collecting urine. So the kidneys make it, ureters move it, and bladder stores (collects) it. So the correct answer should be the bladder, which is option A.

Let me double-check the other options to make sure I'm not mixing anything up. The spleen is part of the immune system, so that's out. Gallbladder stores bile, not urine. Prostate is a gland in males, part of the reproductive system. Renal vein and artery are blood vessels related to the kidneys. Liver processes toxins and aids digestion. So none of those are related to collecting urine.

Yes, I think I'm confident. The bladder is the correct answer.

The structure responsible for collecting urine in the body is the bladder. The kidneys produce urine, which then flows through the ureters to the bladder for storage until it is expelled through the urethra. Among the given options, the bladder (Option A) is the correct answer.

Answer: A
