Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what it's asking.

The problem states that a particle is moving along the x-axis, and its position is given by the equation x equals a plus b times t squared. The given values are a is 20 cm and b is 4 cm per second squared. Then there are three parts: (a) find the displacement between t1=2 seconds and t2=5 seconds, (b) find the average velocity in this interval, and (c) find the instantaneous velocity at t1=2 seconds.

Alright, starting with part (a), displacement. I remember that displacement is the change in position, so it's the final position minus the initial position. So I need to calculate x at t2 and x at t1 and subtract them.

Let's plug in the numbers. The equation is x = a + b t². So for t1=2s, x1 = 20 + 4*(2)^2. 2 squared is 4, 4*4 is 16. So x1 is 20 +16=36 cm.

For t2=5s, x2 =20 +4*(5)^2. 5 squared is 25, 4*25 is 100. So x2 is 20 +100=120 cm.

So displacement is x2 - x1 = 120 -36 =84 cm. That's part (a) done.

Moving on to part (b), average velocity. I think average velocity is just the displacement divided by the time interval. So the time interval here is t2 - t1 =5s -2s=3 seconds.

So average velocity = displacement / time =84 cm /3s=28 cm/s. So that's part (b).

Wait, but wait a second, part (c) is about instantaneous velocity at t=2s. Instantaneous velocity is the derivative of the position with respect to time, right? Because velocity is the rate of change of position.

So the position equation is x= a + b t². Taking the derivative dx/dt gives v= 2b t. Since a is a constant, its derivative is zero. And the derivative of t squared is 2t, multiplied by b gives 2b t.

So v = 2 *4 * t. Because b is 4 cm/s². So v=8t cm/s.

At t=2s, v=8 *2=16 cm/s. So that's part (c).

Putting it all together:

(a) Displacement is 84 cm.

(b) Average velocity is 28 cm/s.

(c) Instantaneous velocity is 16 cm/s.

Now looking at the options, let's see which one matches.

Option C says displacement 84, average 28, instantaneous 16. Yes, that's exactly what I calculated.

Wait, but I should double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, x1 at t=2s: 20 +4*(4) =36. Correct. x2 at 5s: 20 +4*(25)=120. 120-36=84. Correct.

Average velocity: 84 /3=28. Correct.

Velocity function: v=2bt=8t. At t=2, 16. Correct.

So the correct answer should be option C.

To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the particle described by the equation \( x = a + bt^2 \), where \( a = 20 \, \text{cm} \) and \( b = 4 \, \text{cm/s}^2 \). The goal is to determine the displacement, average velocity, and instantaneous velocity for the given time interval \( t_1 = 2 \, \text{s} \) to \( t_2 = 5 \, \text{s} \).

### Part (a): Displacement
Displacement is the change in position, calculated as \( \Delta x = x(t_2) - x(t_1) \). Using the equation \( x = a + bt^2 \):
- At \( t_1 = 2 \, \text{s} \):  
  \[
  x(t_1) = 20 + 4(2)^2 = 20 + 16 = 36 \, \text{cm}.
  \]
- At \( t_2 = 5 \, \text{s} \):  
  \[
  x(t_2) = 20 + 4(5)^2 = 20 + 100 = 120 \, \text{cm}.
  \]
- Displacement:  
  \[
  \Delta x = x(t_2) - x(t_1) = 120 - 36 = 84 \, \text{cm}.
  \]

### Part (b): Average Velocity
Average velocity is the displacement divided by the time interval \( \Delta t = t_2 - t_1 \):  
\[
v_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = \frac{84}{5 - 2} = \frac{84}{3} = 28 \, \text{cm/s}.
\]

### Part (c): Instantaneous Velocity at \( t_1 = 2 \, \text{s} \)
Instantaneous velocity is the derivative of the position function \( x(t) \) with respect to time. Differentiating \( x = a + bt^2 \):  
\[
v(t) = \frac{dx}{dt} = 2bt.
\]
At \( t_1 = 2 \, \text{s} \):  
\[
v(t_1) = 2(4)(2) = 16 \, \text{cm/s}.
\]

### Final Results
- Displacement: \( 84 \, \text{cm} \)
- Average velocity: \( 28 \, \text{cm/s} \)
- Instantaneous velocity at \( t_1 = 2 \, \text{s} \): \( 16 \, \text{cm/s} \)

The option that matches these results is **C**.
