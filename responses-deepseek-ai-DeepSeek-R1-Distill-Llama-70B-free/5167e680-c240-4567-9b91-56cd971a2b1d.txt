Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about fruit flies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my genetics, but let's see if I can work through it.

Alright, the question is about Drosophila melanogaster, and three traits: wing length, body color, and eye color. Each is controlled by a single pair of genes with complete dominance. The genes are on different chromosomes, so they assort independently. That's important because it means I can consider each trait separately.

The parents are both heterozygous for each gene pair. So for each gene, each parent is, say, Ll for wing length, Bb for body color, and Rr for eye color. Wait, no, wait. Let me check the traits again.

Wait, the traits are:
- Long wings (L) vs short wings (l)
- Gray body (B) vs black (b)
- Dull red eyes (R) vs brown eyes (r)

Wait, actually, the notation might be different. Let me clarify: the dominant and recessive alleles. So the parents are heterozygous for each, so each has Ll, Bb, Rr.

The question is asking for the probability that the first adult fly emerging has short wings, gray body, and red eyes. Oh wait, no, wait: short wings, gray body, red eyes?

Wait, wait no, the last part: "dull red dyes"? Or is that a typo? Oh, probably eye color. So the traits are:

- Wing length: long (L) dominant over short (l)
- Body color: gray (B) dominant over black (b)
- Eye color: dull red (R) dominant over brown (r)

Wait, no, wait. The way it's written, the dominant is first. So for each trait, it's like:

- Long wings = L (dominant), short wings = l (recessive)
- Gray body = B (dominant), black body = b (recessive)
- Dull red eyes = R (dominant), brown eyes = r (recessive)

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the way the question is written is a bit confusing. It says each controlled by a single pair, with contrasting genes. The first part is the dominant trait, then the recessive. So for example, long wings = L, short wings = l. Gray body = B, black = b. Dull red eyes = R, brown eyes = r.

Wait, but the question says "dull red dyes = R" and "brown eyes = r." Oh, I'm assuming that's a typo and they mean "dull red eyes." So eye color is R (dull red) dominant, r is recessive (brown eyes).

So each gene is independent, so we can calculate each trait's probability separately and then multiply them together.

So the parents are heterozygous for all three genes, which means their genotypes are Ll Bb Rr each.

Wait, but the cross is between two flies heterozygous for each pair of genes. So each parent is Ll Bb Rr. So when they cross, each trait will segregate according to Mendelian inheritance.

The question is asking for the probability that the first fly has the phenotype: short-winged, gray-bodied, red-eyed.

Wait, but wait. Let's break down each trait.

Short wings: that's the recessive phenotype, so the genotype must be ll. For an Ll x Ll cross, the probability of ll is 25% (since Ll x Ll gives 25% LL, 50% Ll, 25% ll. So the chance for each offspring to be ll is 1/4.

Gray body: that's dominant, so the phenotype is either BB or Bb. But wait, the parents are Bb x Bb. So the possible genotypes are BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%). But the phenotype for B_ is gray. So the probability of gray is 75% (25 + 50 = 75% = 3/4).

Wait no, wait. Wait, the question is about the offspring being gray-bodied. So the parents are Bb and Bb. So the possible phenotypic ratios are 3:1. So the chance of gray (dominant) is 3/4.

Similarly for eye color, the question says red-eyed. Red is dominant, R. Parents are Rr x Rr. So the probability of Rr or RR is 3/4 (dominant), so red eyes is 3/4.

Wait, but wait. The question is asking for red eyes, which is R_. So the probability is 3/4.

But wait, the question is about the phenotype: short wings, gray body, red eyes.

So, each trait is independent. So the probabilities multiply.

So, probability of short wings: 1/4.

Probability of gray body: 3/4.

Probability of red eyes: 3/4.

So total probability is (1/4) * (3/4) * (3/4) = (1 * 3 * 3) / (4 *4 *4) ) = 9/64.

Wait, but wait. Let me recalculate that. 1/4 multiplied by 3/4 is 3/16. Then 3/16 multiplied by 3/4 is 9/64.

Yes, so 9/64.

Looking at the options, option C is 9/64. So the answer is C.

To solve the problem, we analyze the three traits (wing length, body color, and eye color) independently, as the genes controlling these traits are located on different chromosomes and assort independently. Each trait is controlled by a single pair of genes with complete dominance, and the parents are heterozygous for all three gene pairs (Ll Bb Rr).

### Step 1: Probability of each phenotype
1. **Short wings (ll):**  
   - The parents are heterozygous (Ll × Ll).  
   - The probability of the recessive phenotype (ll) is:  
     \[
     P(\text{short wings}) = \frac{1}{4}
     \]

2. **Gray body (B_):**  
   - The parents are heterozygous (Bb × Bb).  
   - The dominant phenotype (gray body) includes genotypes BB and Bb.  
   - The probability of the dominant phenotype is:  
     \[
     P(\text{gray body}) = \frac{3}{4}
     \]

3. **Red eyes (R_):**  
   - The parents are heterozygous (Rr × Rr).  
   - The dominant phenotype (red eyes) includes genotypes RR and Rr.  
   - The probability of the dominant phenotype is:  
     \[
     P(\text{red eyes}) = \frac{3}{4}
     \]

### Step 2: Combine the probabilities
Since the traits are independent, the overall probability of the desired phenotype (short-winged, gray-bodied, and red-eyed) is the product of the individual probabilities:  
\[
P(\text{short wings, gray body, red eyes}) = P(\text{short wings}) \times P(\text{gray body}) \times P(\text{red eyes})
\]  
Substituting the values:  
\[
P = \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{3}{4} \times \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{64}
\]

### Final Answer
The probability that the first adult fly emerging is short-winged, gray-bodied, and red-eyed is **9/64**.  

**C**
