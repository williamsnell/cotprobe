Question:

A construction company was doing repairs and replacing portions of a sidewalk and railing next to a lake. The construction crew started tearing out the old sidewalk and railing, but stopped work when it started to get dark. The construction crew left without putting up a warning sign or barrier around the work area. A few hours later, a jogger came along the sidewalk. Not realizing the construction work was in progress there, the jogger stumbled and fell at the spot where the construction crew had torn up the sidewalk and railing. The jogger fell into the lake. As the jogger was attempting to stay afloat, he began screaming, "Help! Help! I can't swim. I'm drowning. " His screams attracted the attention of a person who was passing on his bicycle. The cyclist immediately hurried to assist the jogger. As the cyclist was leaning over the edge of the lake, trying to help the jogger get out of the water, he lost his balance and fell into the lake. Both the jogger and cyclist suffered serious bodily injuries before they were pulled out of the water by police. In a negligence action by the cyclist to recover for his personal injuries, the construction company will most probably

Options:

A: not be held liable, because the construction company could not foresee that anyone would be hurt while trying to rescue someone from the lake.
B: not be held liable, because the cyclist assumed the risk by leaning over the edge of the lake.
C: not be held liable, because it was the jogger's responsibility to avoid the construction area.
D: be held liable, because they did not properly secure the worksite after finishing for the day.
E: be held liable, because the construction company would be strictly liable to anyone injured by the failure to put adequate warnings or barriers around the site of the sidewalk repairs.
F: be held liable, because the cyclist's attempt to rescue the jogger was foreseeable.
G: not be held liable, because the jogger should have been aware of the construction work.
H: be held liable, because they failed to provide adequate lighting for the construction site.
I: not be held liable, because the cyclist voluntarily put himself in danger.

Okay, so I've got this question about negligence, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read through it carefully.

So, the situation is that a construction company was repairing a sidewalk and railing next to a lake. They tore out the old stuff but stopped work because it got dark. They didn't put up any warning signs or barriers. Later, a jogger came by, didn't realize the construction was ongoing, stumbled, fell into the lake, and couldn't swim. He screamed for help, and a cyclist heard him. The cyclist tried to help but fell in too, and both got hurt before the police rescued them.

The question is about whether the construction company is liable for the cyclist's injuries in a negligence action.

Hmm, I remember that negligence involves four elements: duty, breach, causation, and damages. The company likely had a duty to make the site safe or at least warn people, especially since it's next to a lake, which is a dangerous spot if someone falls in.

They breached that duty by not putting up warnings or barriers when they left. Now, the issue is causation. The company's actions led to the jogger's fall, which led to the cyclist trying to rescue him, which caused the cyclist's injuries.

Wait, but in negligence, the plaintiff must show that the defendant's breach was the proximate cause of the harm. Also, under the "rescue doctrine," a rescuer's injuries are generally considered foreseeable if the initial harm was caused by the defendant's negligence. So the company could be liable not just for the jogger's injuries but also the rescuer's.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the company isn't liable because they couldn't foresee someone being hurt while rescuing. But the rescue doctrine suggests that rescuers are foreseeable. So A is probably wrong.

Option B states the cyclist assumed the risk. But assumption of risk is more of a defense when the plaintiff voluntarily takes a known risk. Here, the cyclist was trying to help someone in an emergency, so assumption of risk might not apply. Plus, the company's negligence created the emergency, so B might not be correct.

Option C says it's the jogger's fault. But the question is about the cyclist's claim, not the jogger's. So C is irrelevant here.

Option D says they didn't secure the site. That's true, but the exact reason for liability would be because their failure caused the chain of events leading to the injuries. So D is a possible answer but maybe not the most precise.

Option E claims strict liability, but strict liability usually applies to abnormally dangerous activities or products. I don't think sidewalk repair qualifies, so E is likely incorrect.

Option F says the cyclist's rescue attempt was foreseeable. That aligns with the rescue doctrine. Since the company should have anticipated that someone might try to rescue a person in distress caused by their negligence, F seems like a strong candidate.

Option G says the jogger should have been aware. Again, the question is about the cyclist, so maybe G isn't relevant. Also, the company didn't put up warnings, so the jogger might not have known.

Option H mentions lighting. The scenario says they stopped because it got dark, but the issue was the lack of barriers or warnings, not lighting. So H might not be the main issue.

Option I says the cyclist voluntarily put himself in danger. But under the rescue doctrine, rescuers aren't considered to have assumed the risk in an emergency situation caused by the defendant's negligence. So I is probably wrong.

So putting it all together, the construction company's failure to secure the site led to the jogger's fall, which necessitated a rescue attempt by the cyclist. The company should have foreseen that someone might try to rescue, making the cyclist's injuries a foreseeable result of their negligence. Therefore, the correct answer should be F.

The construction company's failure to secure the worksite by not putting up warning signs or barriers created a dangerous situation. This negligence led to the jogger's fall into the lake and the subsequent rescue attempt by the cyclist. Under the rescue doctrine, injuries sustained by a rescuer in an emergency caused by the defendant's negligence are considered foreseeable. Therefore, the construction company can be held liable for the cyclist's injuries because the rescue attempt was a foreseeable consequence of their breach of duty.

The correct answer is **F**.

Answer: F
