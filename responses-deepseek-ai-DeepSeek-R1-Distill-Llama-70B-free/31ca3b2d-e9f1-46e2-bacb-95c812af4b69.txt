Question:

A 63-year-old woman comes to the physician 1 day after the sudden onset of pain and swelling of her right knee. She has had no injury. Her medications include occasional ibuprofen for mild osteoarthritis of both knees. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 97/min, respirations are 19/min, and blood pressure is 129/79 mm Hg. Examination of the right knee shows warmth, erythema, and effusion. Exquisite tenderness is produced with minimal range-of-motion testing. Examination of synovial fluid obtained via joint aspiration shows that it is clear, with positively birefringent rhomboids observed under polarized light microscopy. Deposition of which of the following substances is the most likely cause of these findings?

Options:

A: Sodium pyrophosphate
B: Sodium urate
C: Aluminum urate
D: Magnesium pyrophosphate
E: Calcium pyrophosphate
F: Potassium oxalate
G: Calcium urate
H: Ammonium urate
I: Calcium oxalate
J: Calcium sulfate

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a patient with sudden knee pain and swelling. Let me try to think through it step by step.

The patient is a 63-year-old woman who came in a day after her symptoms started. No injury, so it's probably not traumatic. She's taking ibuprofen occasionally for mild osteoarthritis in both knees. Her vitals are pretty normal—temperature is 37°C, which is just about normal, no fever. Pulse is a bit high at 97, but not super concerning. Blood pressure looks okay too.

On exam, the right knee is warm, red, and swollen. She has a lot of tenderness when moving the knee. They did a synovial fluid aspiration, and the fluid is clear. Under polarized light microscopy, they saw positively birefringent rhomboids. Hmm, okay, so I need to think about what crystals are associated with joint effusions and what they look like under a microscope.

I remember that when joint fluid is analyzed, the presence of crystals can indicate either gout or pseudogout. Gout is caused by monosodium urate crystals, and pseudogout is caused by calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals. 

Wait, what's the difference in their appearance? Oh right, under polarized light, urate crystals (in gout) are negatively birefringent, meaning they appear dark when the polarizer is aligned. They look needle-shaped. On the other hand, calcium pyrophosphate (CPPD) crystals are usually positively birefringent and rhomboid or rod-shaped. So in the question, the crystals are positively birefringent and rhomboid. That points more towards CPPD disease, which is pseudogout.

So the substance deposited would be calcium pyrophosphate. Let me look at the options. Option E is Calcium pyrophosphate. So that's the likely answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not confusing anything. Sodium pyrophosphate is different, right? Or is it the same as calcium? No, sodium and calcium are different ions. The crystals in pseudogout are calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD), and in gout, it's monosodium urate (MSU). So the correct answer should be E.

Another thought—sometimes, other substances can mimic these conditions, but in this case, the findings are classic for pseudogout. The sudden onset without trauma, the clear fluid (as opposed to infected fluid which might be more turbid), and the specific crystal appearance. So yeah, I'm pretty confident it's E.

The patient presents with sudden onset of pain and swelling in her right knee without a history of injury. Her examination reveals warmth, erythema, effusion, and exquisite tenderness. Synovial fluid analysis shows clear fluid with positively birefringent rhomboids under polarized light microscopy. These findings are characteristic of pseudogout, a condition caused by the deposition of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals. 

In contrast to gout, where monosodium urate crystals are negatively birefringent and needle-shaped, pseudogout is distinguished by positively birefringent, rhomboid-shaped crystals. Among the options provided, calcium pyrophosphate (Option E) is the correct answer, as it is the substance deposited in pseudogout.

Answer: E
