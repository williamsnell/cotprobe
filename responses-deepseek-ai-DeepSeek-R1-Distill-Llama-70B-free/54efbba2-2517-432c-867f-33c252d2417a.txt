Okay, so I've got this statistics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that the annual earnings per share (EPS) has a mean of $8.6 and a standard deviation of $3.4. I need to find the probability that an observed EPS is less than $5.5. The options are from A to J, each with different probabilities.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with probabilities involving means and standard deviations, it's usually about the normal distribution. So I think this is a Z-score problem. Z-scores tell us how many standard deviations away from the mean our value is.

The formula for the Z-score is Z = (X - μ) / σ, where X is the value we're interested in, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation. So plugging in the numbers from the problem, X is 5.5, μ is 8.6, and σ is 3.4.

Let me calculate that. So 5.5 minus 8.6 is... that's -3.1. Then divide by 3.4. Let me do the math: -3.1 divided by 3.4. Hmm, 3.1 divided by 3.4 is approximately 0.9118. But since it's negative, the Z-score is about -0.9118.

Wait, wait, let me double-check that calculation. 3.1/3.4. Let's see, 3.4 times 0.9 is 3.06. So 3.1 is a bit more than that. So 0.9 plus (0.04/3.4). 0.04 divided by 3.4 is about 0.01176. So approximately 0.91176, which I can round to 0.9118. So yes, the Z-score is approximately -0.9118.

Now I need to find the probability that Z is less than -0.9118. In other words, P(Z < -0.9118). This is the area under the standard normal curve to the left of Z = -0.9118.

I think I should look this up in the standard normal distribution table. But wait, I don't have the table in front of me. Alternatively, I can remember that for negative Z-scores, the probabilities are the same as for positive ones but on the opposite side of the mean.

Wait, no. The standard normal table gives the area to the left of Z. So for a positive Z, say 0.91, the area is about 0.8 something, but for a negative Z like -0.91, it's the area on the left side, which would be less than 0.5.

Alternatively, I can think about the symmetry. The Z-table gives the cumulative probability up to Z. So for Z = 0.91, the area is 0.8 something, so for Z = -0.91, the area would be 1 minus that, but wait, actually no. Let me think again.

Wait no, the standard normal distribution is symmetric around zero. So P(Z < -a) is equal to P(Z > a). So the area to the left of -a is the same as the area to the right of a.

So for example, if Z is 1.28, the area to the left is about 0.8997, but wait no, that's for positive. Let me correct. Let me think: For Z = 0.91, the cumulative probability is about 0.8186. So for Z = -0.91, the cumulative probability is 1 - 0.8186 = 0.1814.

Wait, no, that can't be right because 0.8186 is the area up to 0.91, so the area up to -0.91 is 1 - 0.8186 = 0.1814. So the probability that Z is less than -0.91 is 0.1814.

Wait, but wait another second. Because the exact Z-score here is -0.9118. So that's a bit more negative than -0.91. So the area would be a little less than 0.1814. Or wait, no, because as Z becomes more negative (further from zero), the cumulative probability decreases. Wait, no, because when Z is more negative, it's going left, so the area would be smaller.

Wait, let's think again. The Z of -0.91 has a cumulative probability of 0.1814. If our Z is -0.9118, which is a bit more negative than -0.91, then the cumulative probability should be slightly less than 0.1814. So perhaps around 0.18 or lower.

Looking at the options, option F is 0.1814 and option J is 0.1587. Hmm, so which one is correct?

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a more precise calculation or interpolation. Let me try that.

Looking at the standard normal table for Z = 0.91. Let's see, for Z=0.91, the cumulative probability is 0.8186. So for Z=-0.91, it's 0.1814.

But our Z is -0.9118, which is a bit beyond -0.91. So we can look for the exact value between -0.91 and -0.92.

Wait, let me check the Z-table for more precise values. Alternatively, perhaps I can remember that for each 0.01 increase in Z beyond 0.91, the cumulative probability increases by a certain amount.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the exact value. The exact Z is approximately -0.9118. So let's see, the standard normal table for Z=0.91 gives 0.8186. For Z=0.92, it's about 0.8212. So the difference between Z=0.91 and Z=0.92 is 0.8212 - 0.8186 = 0.0026 per 0.01 Z.

Our Z is 0.9118, which is 0.0018 above 0.91. So the cumulative probability would be approximately 0.8186 + (0.0018/0.01)*0.0026.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, the cumulative probability increases as Z increases, so for a Z of 0.91, it's 0.8186. For 0.9118, which is 0.0018 above 0.91, the cumulative probability would be 0.8186 + (0.0018) * (0.0026 per 0.01), but that would be 0.8186 + (0.0018 * 0.26) because 0.0026 per 0.01 is 0.26 per 0.1. Wait, maybe I'm complicating it.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to approximate. The exact Z is -0.9118, so the area to the left is approximately 0.1814 minus a little bit more. Because from Z=-0.91 to Z=-0.92, the cumulative probability decreases from 0.1814 to 0.1788 (assuming that at Z=-0.92, the cumulative is 0.1788). Wait, no, let me get the exact values from the table.

Wait, I don't have the exact table, but I can try to recall or approximate. Let me think, for Z=0.91, it's 0.8186, so Z=0.92 is about 0.8212. So the difference between 0.91 and 0.92 is 0.0026.

So for Z=0.9118, which is 0.0018 beyond 0.91, the cumulative probability would be 0.8186 + (0.0018/0.01)*0.0026. So 0.0018 is 0.18 of 0.01, so 0.18 * 0.0026 is approximately 0.000468. So the cumulative probability at Z=0.9118 is approximately 0.8186 + 0.000468 = 0.819068. Therefore, the cumulative probability for Z=-0.9118 is 1 - 0.819068 = 0.180932, which is approximately 0.1809.

Looking at the options, option F is 0.1814, which is very close. So perhaps the exact answer is around 0.1814. Alternatively, perhaps the exact calculation would give a slightly different value.

Wait, but another approach. Another way to compute probabilities is using the empirical rule or the 68-95-99.7 rule, but that's more approximate. However, since 0.91 is close to 1, the 95% is within 2 sigma, but I don't think that's directly helpful here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator approach, but since I don't have one, I'll have to rely on the table. Wait, maybe I can recall that for Z=0.91, it's 0.8186, and for Z=0.92, it's 0.8212. So the difference is 0.0026 over 0.01 Z. So per 0.001 Z, that's 0.0026 / 10 = 0.00026 per 0.001 Z.

Wait, no, because from 0.91 to 0.92 is 0.01 Z, and the cumulative increases by 0.0026. So per 0.001 increase in Z, the cumulative increases by 0.0026 / 10 = 0.00026.

So for Z=0.9118, which is 0.91 + 0.0018, the cumulative would be 0.8186 + (0.0018)*0.00026? Wait, that doesn't make sense because 0.0018 * 0.00026 would be 0.000000468, which is negligible. That can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the way the increments work. Let me think again. If from Z=0.91 to Z=0.92, the cumulative increases by 0.0026. So for each 0.01 increase in Z, the cumulative increases by 0.0026. So for each 0.001 increase in Z, the cumulative increases by 0.0026 / 10 = 0.00026.

So for an increase of 0.0018 in Z beyond 0.91, the cumulative would increase by 0.00026 * 1.8 = approximately 0.000468. So the cumulative at Z=0.9118 would be approximately 0.8186 + 0.000468 = 0.819068.

Therefore, the cumulative for Z=-0.9118 is 1 - 0.819068 = 0.180932, which is approximately 0.1809. So about 0.181.

Looking back at the options, option F is 0.1814, which is very close to 0.1809. So that's probably the correct answer. But wait, another option is J: 0.1587, which is lower than 0.18. So why would that be?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation or the approach. Let me try another way. Maybe I can use the formula for the standard normal distribution. But without exact tables or a calculator, it's hard. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the question is multiple choice, and the options are given. So perhaps the correct answer is F: 0.1814.

Wait, but wait another thing: 5.5 is less than the mean of 8.6, so the probability should be less than 0.5, which all the options are. So that makes sense.

Wait, another approach: using the empirical rule. The mean is 8.6, standard deviation is 3.4. So 5.5 is 8.6 - 3.4*0.9118. Wait, no, that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I can think in terms of percentiles. If 5.5 is below the mean, then the probability is less than 0.5. The exact value would depend on how far it is in terms of standard deviations.

Wait, another way: perhaps I can recall that for a Z of -1, the cumulative probability is about 0.1587, which is option J. So if the Z is -0.9118, which is less negative than -1, the cumulative probability would be higher than 0.1587. So 0.1814 is higher than 0.1587, which makes sense because -0.91 is to the right of -1, so the area should be larger than 0.1587.

So yes, that makes sense. Therefore, the correct answer should be option F: 0.1814.

Wait, but wait, I thought that Z=-1 is approximately 0.1587. So for a Z of -0.91, it's 0.1814, which is higher than 0.1587. So yes, that's correct.

So the answer is F.
</think>

To determine the probability that an observed EPS is less than $5.5, we start by calculating the Z-score using the formula:

\[
Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}
\]

where \( X = 5.5 \), \( \mu = 8.6 \), and \( \sigma = 3.4 \). Plugging in the values:

\[
Z = \frac{5.5 - 8.6}{3.4} = \frac{-3.1}{3.4} \approx -0.9118
\]

The Z-score of \(-0.9118\) indicates that the value \( 5.5 \) is approximately 0.9118 standard deviations below the mean. To find the probability \( P(Z < -0.9118) \), we use the standard normal distribution table. For \( Z = 0.91 \), the cumulative probability is approximately \( 0.8186 \). Since the standard normal distribution is symmetric, the cumulative probability for \( Z = -0.91 \) is:

\[
P(Z < -0.91) = 1 - 0.8186 = 0.1814
\]

For \( Z = -0.9118 \), which is slightly more negative than \( -0.91 \), the cumulative probability is slightly less than \( 0.1814 \). However, the difference is negligible, and the closest value among the options is \( 0.1814 \).

Thus, the probability that an observed EPS is less than $5.5 is approximately \( 0.1814 \).
