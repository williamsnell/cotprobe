Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. The question is about a character that's always transmitted from the mother to the offspring but never from the father. Hmm, that's interesting. I need to determine the mode of inheritance from the given options.

Alright, let's think. So, if a trait is always passed from the mother and not the father, what does that imply? Well, I remember that traits can be autosomal (not sex-linked) or sex-linked, and also there's something about mitochondrial inheritance.

Wait, mitochondrial DNA is passed from the mother because sperm doesn't contribute mitochondria to the embryo. So if a trait is inherited from the mother only, it's probably mitochondrial, which is extrachromosomal. Because chromosomes are in the nucleus, and mitochondria have their own DNA.

Let me look at the options. Option G is "Extrachromosomal inheritance." That must be mitochondrial or perhaps chloroplast DNA, but since we're talking about animals, it's definitely mitochondria. So that fits the description.

Wait any other options to consider? Like, what about sex-linked? For example, if the father passes an X chromosome, but that's not the case here because the trait is never passed from the father. So in X-linked recessive, fathers pass the X to daughters. But if the trait is never passed from father to any offspring, maybe it's not on the X chromosome. Because fathers can pass X-linked traits to daughters.

Alternatively, if it's a Y-linked trait, fathers pass it only to sons, but the question says the trait is never passed from the father. So that doesn't fit. So it's not Y-linked.

So the only option that fits is extrachromosomal, which is G.

Let me double-check the options:

A: Mutation - No, mutation is a change in DNA, not a mode of inheritance.

B: Codominance - That's about how alleles express, not inheritance pattern.

C: Sex-linked dominant - But again, dominant X would be passed from father to all daughters, and sometimes sons if it's X. Wait, no, fathers can only give X to daughters. So if the trait is from mother but not father, it can't be X-linked because father can pass X (with the trait) to daughters. So that doesn't fit.

D: Absence of certain genes in father - Not really, because it's possible the father has the gene but doesn't pass it. But in this case, the question states that the father never transmits it, implying the gene isn't present in the father's germ cells. Hmm, maybe, but I think it's more about the type of inheritance rather than the absence.

E: Polygenic - That's multiple genes, doesn't explain maternal only.

F: Environmental influence - No, because it's about inheritance.

G: Extrachromosomal - Yes, that fits.

H: Autosomal recessive - Fathers can pass autosomes, so this doesn't explain why only mothers pass it.

I: Inheritance from father - Opposite of the case.

J: Incomplete dominance - Again, expression, not transmission.

So the correct answer should be G.

The question asks about a trait that is always transmitted from the mother to the offspring but never from the father. This pattern suggests a mode of inheritance that is not linked to the nuclear chromosomes, as fathers can pass autosomal or sex-linked traits under certain conditions. Instead, the trait is likely linked to extrachromosomal inheritance, specifically mitochondrial DNA, which is passed exclusively from the mother. This eliminates other options like sex-linked inheritance or autosomal inheritance, as fathers can transmit those under specific circumstances. Therefore, the correct answer is:

G: Extrachromosomal inheritance

Answer: G
