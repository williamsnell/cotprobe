Question:

A surgeon operated on a patient in an operating room in the Marina General Hospital. The surgeon was assisted by an intern, who was assigned to the operation by the hospital, and a nurse, who was on the staff of the hospital. During the patient's convalescence, the patient complained of pain not explicable as an ordinary post-operative symptom. On investigation, it turned out that the intern and nurse, who had worked together in bandaging him, had done so in such a way as to constrict certain blood vessels. The faulty bandaging had caused acute pain and retarded the patient's recovery. After the patient's eventual recovery, he sued the intern, claiming $20,000 in damages. Before the case went to trial, the patient and intern agreed to a settlement in which the intern paid the patient $12,000, and the patient released the intern from all further claims for liability arising out of the incident. If the intern brings suit against the nurse for contribution, the most likely result is that the intern will

Options:

A: prevail, because the nurse's liability is established under res ipsa loquitur
B: not prevail, because the intern was the one who agreed to the settlement.
C: not prevail, because the intern's proper remedy is indemnification, not contribution.
D: not prevail, because one who settles without judgment cannot recover contribution.
E: not prevail, because the nurse was just following the intern's orders.
F: not prevail, because the intern already accepted a settlement.
G: prevail, because one who settles without judgment can recover contribution.
H: prevail, because both were equally responsible for the patient's pain.
I: prevail, because the nurse was also involved in the faulty bandaging.
J: prevail, because the nurse should have known better as a staff member of the hospital.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here about tort law, specifically dealing with contribution among tortfeasors. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. 

The scenario is about a surgeon, an intern, and a nurse in a hospital. During the patient's recovery, there was faulty bandaging that caused pain and slowed healing. The patient sued the intern and settled for $12k. Now, the intern is suing the nurse for contribution. The question is whether the intern will prevail.

I remember that in tort law, when multiple parties are liable for a plaintiff's injury, each can be held jointly and severally liable. So if one pays more than their share, they can seek contribution from the others. But there are some nuances here.

First, I think about the type of liability each might have. The intern and nurse were both involved in the bandaging. So perhaps both were negligent. But the question is, can the intern get contribution from the nurse?

I recall that contribution is typically available among joint tortfeasors. But sometimes, if someone settles with the plaintiff without a judgment, does that affect their ability to seek contribution?

Wait, there's a rule about this. If a defendant settles with the plaintiff and there's no judgment entered against them, they might not be able to seek contribution from other tortfeasors. Because, without a judgment, it's not clear whether they were actually at fault. 

So in this case, the intern settled without a trial, so there's no judgment against them. They just agreed to pay the patient $12k. If they try to get contribution from the nurse, the nurse might argue that since there was no determination of the intern's liability, the intern can't seek contribution.

Looking at the options, option D says the intern can't recover because one who settles without judgment cannot recover contribution. That sounds familiar. I think that's the case because, without a judgment, the liability isn't established, so contribution isn't available.

Other options: A says res ipsa loquitur applies, but I don't think that's directly relevant here. B says because the intern settled, but the reason is more about the judgment. C talks about indemnification vs. contribution. Indemnification is when one party is held solely responsible and can shift all liability, but contribution is about sharing liability. So maybe not C.

E suggests the nurse was following orders, which might imply the intern was more responsible, but does that bar contribution? Not necessarily. If both were negligent, they could still be joint tortfeasors.

F says the intern can't because they accepted a settlement. But I think it's more about the lack of judgment. So D is more precise.

G says that settling without judgment allows contribution, which I think is the opposite of the correct rule.

H and I talk about equal responsibility and being involved, which might be true, but the legal rule about judgment is a barrier.

So I think the correct answer is D: not prevail, because one who settles without judgment cannot recover contribution.

The question revolves around whether an intern, who settled with a patient without a judgment, can seek contribution from a nurse who was also involved in the alleged negligent bandaging. In tort law, contribution allows a defendant who has paid more than their share of liability to recover from other joint tortfeasors. However, a critical legal principle applies here: generally, a defendant who settles with the plaintiff without a judgment being entered against them cannot later seek contribution from other parties. This is because, without a judgment, the settling party's liability is not formally established, which is typically a prerequisite for seeking contribution.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, H, I, J**: These options focus on the nurse's potential liability or the intern's responsibility but do not address the key legal barrier here, which is the lack of a judgment against the intern.  
- **B, F**: While these options mention the settlement, they do not accurately capture the specific legal reason why the intern cannot recover contribution.  
- **C**: This option conflates indemnification with contribution. Indemnification applies when one party is entirely responsible and can shift all liability, which is not the case here.  
- **D**: This is the correct answer because it directly addresses the legal rule that one who settles without a judgment cannot recover contribution.  
- **E, G**: These options are incorrect because they either misstate the law or fail to apply the correct legal principle.

Thus, the intern cannot prevail in seeking contribution from the nurse due to the absence of a judgment establishing liability.

**Answer: D**
