Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an infinite line of charge and its electric field. Hmm, I remember that the electric field around a line charge is calculated using a specific formula. Let me think about what I learned in class.

Wait, right! The electric field E at a distance r from an infinite line charge is given by E = (λ) / (2πε₀ r). Oh wait, or was it (λ)/(2πε₀ r)? Yeah, that sounds right. I think λ is the linear charge density, which is what we're solving for here.

So the problem gives me E as 4.5e4 N/C, and the distance r is 2.0 meters. I need to find λ. Let me write down the formula and plug in the numbers.

Wait, I should probably recall the value of ε₀, which is the permittivity of free space. I think ε₀ is approximately 8.85e-12 C²/(N·m²). Yeah, that's right.

So rearranging the formula to solve for λ, since E = λ/(2πε₀ r), that means λ = E * 2πε₀ r.

Let me plug in the numbers. E is 4.5e4 N/C, r is 2.0 m. So:

λ = (4.5e4 N/C) * 2 * π * (8.85e-12 C²/(N·m²)) * 2.0 m.

Wait, let me compute that step by step. First, compute 2πr. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the formula is E = λ/(2πε₀ r), so λ = E * 2π ε₀ r. So yeah, that's 2π multiplied by ε₀, multiplied by r, then multiplied by E.

So calculating the numbers:

First, let's compute 2π. 2π is approximately 6.2832.

Then, multiply by ε₀: 6.2832 * 8.85e-12 = let me compute that. 6 * 8.85e-12 is about 5.31e-11, and 0.2832 * 8.85e-12 is roughly 2.5e-12. So together approximately 5.31e-11 + 0.25e-11 = 5.56e-11? Wait, maybe I should just multiply them directly.

Wait, 6.2832 * 8.85e-12 = let's compute 6 * 8.85 = 53.1, 0.2832 *8.85 is approximately 2.505. So 53.1 + 2.505 = 55.605, so 55.605e-12. Wait, no, wait. Wait it's 6.2832 *8.85e-12. Oh wait, 6.2832 *8.85 is 55.605, so 55.605e-12. So that's 5.5605e-11? Hmm, perhaps I should just use a calculator approach.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute 2π * ε₀ first, then multiply by r, then E.

Alternatively, let's compute 2π * ε₀ * r first. 2π is about 6.2832, ε₀ is 8.85e-12, and r is 2.0 m.

So 6.2832 * 8.85e-12 = let me compute that. 6.2832 *8.85 = 55.605, so 55.605e-12. Multiply by 2 m: 55.605e-12 * 2 = 111.21e-12 = 1.1121e-10.

Wait, but that's 2π ε₀ r. So now, λ = E * (2π ε₀ r) = 4.5e4 N/C * 1.1121e-10 C²/(N·m²) · m. Because wait, the units: let me think. E is N/C, which is (N/C) = (N/(C·m)) * m? Hmm, perhaps I should not get stuck on units right now.

Wait, simplifying, E has units N/C, and the term 2πε₀ r has units of (C²/(N·m²)) * m = C²/(N·m). So when multiplied together, E * (2πε₀ r) would be (N/C) * (C²/(N·m)) ) = (N * C²) ) / (C * N * m) ) → C/m, which is correct for linear charge density (C/m).

So going back, λ = 4.5e4 * 1.1121e-10.

Let me compute 4.5e4 * 1.1121e-10.

4.5e4 is 45000.

So 45000 * 1.1121e-10 = (4.5e4) * (1.1121e-10) = 4.5 * 1.1121e-6 = because 1e4 * 1e-10 is 1e-6.

4.5 * 1.1121 is about 4.5 * 1.1121. Let me compute 4 *1.1121=4.4484, 0.5 *1.1121=0.55605. So total is 4.4484 + 0.55605 ≈ 5.00445. So 5.00445e-6 C/m.

Wait, 5e-6 C/m is 5 microcoulombs per meter because 1e-6 is micro. Oh wait, wait, 5e-6 is 5 μC/m. But the options don't have 5. Let me check my calculations again because maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let's double-check the numbers. Let's compute 4.5e4 * 1.1121e-10.

Wait, 4.5e4 is 45000, 1.1121e-10 is 0.00000000011121. So 45000 * 0.00000000011121.

Wait, 45000 * 1.1121e-10.

Alternatively, 4.5e4 * 1.1121e-10 = 4.5 * 1.1121e-6. Because 4.5e4 is 4.5 *1e4, and 1e4 *1e-10 is 1e-6.

So 4.5 * 1.1121 is approximately 5.0045, so 5.0045e-6 C/m → 5.0045 μC/m.

Looking at the options, option G is 5.0 μC/m. Option I is 4.0, option C is 2.5, etc. So the answer should be option G.

But wait, perhaps I made a calculation mistake. Let me recalculate the 4.5e4 *1.1121e-10.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it in exponents.

4.5e4 = 4.5 * 10^4.

1.1121e-10 = 1.1121 * 10^-10.

Multiply them: (4.5 *1.1121) * 10^(4-10) = (5.0045) * 10^-6 → 5.0045e-6 C/m.

Yes, that's 5.0045 μC/m, which is approximately 5.0 μC/m. So option G is correct.

Wait, but let me double-check the initial formula. Did I get the formula right? Because another possible formula I might confuse is for a cylinder or something else.

No, for an infinite line charge, the electric field is radial and given by E = (λ)/(2πε₀ r). So yes, that's correct. So I think the approach is right.

To determine the linear charge density \( \lambda \) for an infinite line of charge, we use the formula:

\[
E = \frac{\lambda}{2 \pi \epsilon_0 r}
\]

Rearranging for \( \lambda \):

\[
\lambda = E \cdot 2 \pi \epsilon_0 r
\]

### Given:
- \( E = 4.5 \times 10^4 \, \mathrm{N/C} \)
- \( r = 2.0 \, \mathrm{m} \)
- \( \epsilon_0 = 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \, \mathrm{C^2/(N \cdot m^2)} \)

### Calculation:
1. Compute \( 2 \pi \epsilon_0 r \):
   \[
   2 \pi \epsilon_0 r = 2 \cdot 3.1416 \cdot (8.85 \times 10^{-12}) \cdot 2.0
   \]
   \[
   2 \pi \epsilon_0 r = 6.2832 \cdot 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \cdot 2.0 = 1.1121 \times 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{C^2/(N \cdot m)}
   \]

2. Multiply by \( E \) to find \( \lambda \):
   \[
   \lambda = (4.5 \times 10^4) \cdot (1.1121 \times 10^{-10})
   \]
   \[
   \lambda = 5.0045 \times 10^{-6} \, \mathrm{C/m}
   \]

### Final Result:
The linear charge density is approximately \( 5.0 \, \mu \mathrm{C/m} \), which corresponds to option **G**.
