Question:

Suppose that the Durbin Watson test is applied to a regression containing two explanatory variables plus a constant with 50 data points. The test statistic takes a value of 1.53. What is the appropriate conclusion?

Options:

B: There is a strong linear relationship between the variables
C: The regression model is incorrectly specified
D: The residuals are heteroscedastic
E: Residuals appear not to be autocorrelated
F: The residuals are homoscedastic
G: There is no relationship between the variables
H: Residuals appear to be positively autocorrelated
I: Residuals appear to be perfectly autocorrelated
J: The test result is inconclusive

Okay, so I've got this statistics question here about the Durbin-Watson test. Hmm, I remember the Durbin-Watson test is used to detect autocorrelation in the residuals from a regression analysis. Autocorrelation means that the residuals are not randomly distributed; instead, they follow a pattern, like each residual is related to the previous one.

The question says that the test is applied to a regression with two explanatory variables plus a constant, so that's three variables in total, I think. The number of data points is 50. The test statistic is 1.53.

Wait, I need to remember what the Durbin-Watson statistic means. I recall that the DW statistic ranges from 0 to 4. A value of 2 means there's no autocorrelation. If it's below 2, there might be positive autocorrelation, and above 2, negative? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The Durbin-Watson test measures the autocorrelation of the residuals. The statistic is around 2 when there's no autocorrelation. If the value is significantly less than 2, it suggests positive autocorrelation. If it's significantly more than 2, that would indicate negative autocorrelation. But wait, some sources say that a DW less than 2 indicates positive autocorrelation because the sum is smaller when residuals are positively related. So when the statistic is close to 2, like 1.8 or 2.2, it's near the middle.

In this case, the statistic is 1.53. That's below 2, right? So that suggests positive autocorrelation. Because lower values mean the residuals are positively correlated. Wait, wait, I might be mixing this up. Another way: the DW statistic is approximately 2(1 - r), where r is the autocorrelation coefficient. So if r is positive, then the DW would be less than 2. Oh, right, that's correct. So a DW of 1.53 suggests that the residuals are positively autocorrelated.

Wait, but I should also remember the range. The test statistic ranges from 0 to 4. A value around 2 means no autocorrelation. So 1.53 is below 2, so positive autocorrelation.

Looking at the options, option H says residuals appear to be positively autocorrelated. Option E says no autocorrelation. So which is it?

Wait, but what's the cutoff for the Durbin-Watson test? I remember that there are critical values which depend on the number of explanatory variables and the sample size. Since the test can't reject the null hypothesis if the DW statistic is within a certain range around 2.

Wait, the null hypothesis for the Durbin-Watson test is that there is no autocorrelation. So if the statistic is close to 2, we fail to reject the null. But what's close? The exact critical values are needed, but without them, we have to make a general judgment.

Wait, the given DW is 1.53. How far is that from 2? 2 - 1.53 = 0.47. So it's 0.47 below 2. So that's a moderate decrease. But without exact critical values, it's hard to say if it's significant. But in the context of this question, they might be expecting us to interpret based on the value relative to 2.

So a DW of 1.53 is less than 2, which suggests positive autocorrelation. So the conclusion would be that the residuals are positively autocorrelated.

Looking at the options, option H is "Residuals appear to be positively autocorrelated." Option E is "Residuals appear not to be autocorrelated," which would be if the DW was around 2.

So the correct answer should be H.

The Durbin-Watson test is used to detect autocorrelation in the residuals of a regression model. The test statistic ranges from 0 to 4, with a value of 2 indicating no autocorrelation. Values significantly below 2 suggest positive autocorrelation, while values significantly above 2 suggest negative autocorrelation. 

In this case, the regression model includes two explanatory variables plus a constant, and the test statistic is 1.53 with 50 data points. Since 1.53 is below 2, it indicates positive autocorrelation in the residuals. This is consistent with the interpretation that a Durbin-Watson statistic less than 2 suggests that the residuals are positively correlated.

Among the options provided, the correct conclusion is that the residuals appear to be positively autocorrelated.

Answer: H
