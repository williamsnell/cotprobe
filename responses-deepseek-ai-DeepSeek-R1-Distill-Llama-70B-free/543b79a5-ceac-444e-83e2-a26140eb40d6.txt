Question:

A defendant was booked on a commercial airline flight. When the defendant arrived at the airport, two undercover police narcotics agents observed him. His appearance and actions led the police to believe that he fit the description of a predetermined profile of a drug courier. The officers approached the defendant and told him they wanted to detain him for questioning. The defendant asked what for, and the police explained that they were narcotics agents assigned to the airport and that he fit the profile of a drug courier. They then asked the defendant to hand over his overnight bag. The defendant refused. The officers then explained that he wouldn't be permitted to board the plane unless they inspected the contents of his bag. The defendant told the officers that he changed his mind and decided not to fly today after all. The officers still requested that the defendant turn his overnight bag over to them. The defendant did so, and then he was given permission to leave the airport. The next day, the police had a dog sniff the defendant's bag for narcotics. The results of this search gave police suspicion to believe that the bag contained narcotics. They opened the defendant's bag and found heroin inside. The defendant was subsequently arrested and charged with unlawful possession of narcotics. At trial, the defendant's attorney moves to prevent introduction of the heroin into evidence. This motion will most likely be

Options:

A: granted, because the police did not have probable cause to hold the bag overnight for the search.
B: granted, because the police did not have a warrant to search the bag.
C: denied, because the police had reasonable suspicion to believe that the bag contained narcotics.
D: denied, because the search was conducted with the help of a narcotics detection dog.
E: denied, because the defendant fit the predetermined profile of a narcotics courier.
F: granted, because the police coerced the defendant into handing over his bag.
G: granted, because the police did not have the right to prevent the defendant from boarding the plane.
H: denied, because the defendant voluntarily handed over his bag to the police.
I: denied, because the search resulted from a lawful airport detention.
J: granted, because the heroin was discovered as a result of an unlawful airport detention.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about whether the heroin found in the defendant's bag can be used as evidence. Let me go through the scenario step by step.

So, the defendant is at the airport, and two undercover police narcotics agents see him. They think he fits a drug courier profile, so they approach him. They tell him they want to detain him for questioning. The defendant asks why, and they explain they're narcotics agents and he fits the profile. Then they ask for his overnight bag. He refuses. The officers then say he can't board the plane unless they inspect the bag. The defendant changes his mind about flying and says he won't fly today after all. The officers still ask for the bag, and he hands it over. They let him leave. The next day, they use a dog to sniff the bag, which indicates narcotics. They open it and find heroin. Now, the defendant is charged, and his lawyer is trying to suppress the evidence.

The question is whether the motion to suppress will be granted or denied. The options are A to J.

I think this is about the Fourth Amendment, which protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. The key issues here are probable cause, reasonable suspicion, consent, and the use of a drug-sniffing dog.

So the police detained the defendant because he fit a drug courier profile. They had reasonable suspicion, I guess, because they approached him. But then they asked for his bag. He refused, then they told him he couldn't board unless they inspected it. He decided not to fly and handed over the bag. So did he consent voluntarily, or was it under duress?

In the case where police ask for consent, if it's voluntary, then it's okay. But if the police are detaining him or making him feel like he has no choice, then it's not voluntary. Here, they told him he couldn't board unless they inspect the bag. That sounds coercive. So maybe his consent was not voluntary.

Wait, but he decided not to fly. So maybe he wasn't under arrest, but they were trying to condition his right to board the plane on allowing the search. I'm trying to remember cases about airport stops and luggage.

I recall the case of Florida v. Bostick, where the Supreme Court held that police can ask for consent to search luggage in a bus without it being a seizure if the person feels free to leave. But in this case, the officers were more directive, telling him he couldn't board unless they inspect. That might make it a seizure because he's being prevented from leaving the scene (the airport) unless he complies.

So if the initial stop was based on reasonable suspicion, but then the officers went beyond that by conditioning his boarding on the search, that might be an unlawful detention. Because without probable cause, they can't detain him beyond the initial questioning.

Alternatively, if the defendant handed over the bag voluntarily, then it's a different matter. But the facts say he refused at first, then after they said he couldn't board, he decided not to fly and handed it over. So the question is whether the police's actions made him feel compelled to hand over the bag, making it an invalid consent.

If the consent was involuntary, then the search would be unconstitutional. But if it was voluntary, then the evidence would be admissible.

Another point is the use of the drug-sniffing dog on the bag the next day. A dog sniff is generally not considered a search under the Fourth Amendment, as established in United States v. Place. So if the police had the bag lawfully, the dog sniff wouldn't require a warrant. But if they unlawfully obtained the bag, then the dog sniff wouldn't cure that.

Wait, but in this case, the police had the bag because the defendant handed it over. So if that handover was voluntary, then they have the bag, and the dog sniff is okay. If not, then it's tainted.

So the main issue is whether the defendant's consent was voluntary. If the police's actions were coercive, then the consent is invalid, and the evidence should be suppressed.

Looking at the answer options:

Option F says the motion is granted because the police coerced the defendant into handing over the bag. That sounds plausible.

Option H says denied because the defendant voluntarily handed over the bag. But if the coercion made it involuntary, H would be wrong.

Option G says granted because the police didn't have the right to prevent him from boarding. That seems related to whether the detention was unlawful.

Option A says granted because no probable cause to hold the bag overnight. I'm not sure about that. Once they have the bag, maybe they can hold it if they have reasonable suspicion, but the issue is how they got the bag.

So, the key points are: Was the initial detention lawful? Did the police's actions in conditioning boarding on the search constitute an unlawful detention? Did the defendant's consent to hand over the bag under these circumstances make it involuntary?

If the police didn't have probable cause to arrest him but only reasonable suspicion, they can't detain him beyond a certain point. By preventing him from boarding unless he hands over the bag, that might be exceeding their authority, making the detention unlawful and the consent coerced.

In that case, the evidence would be suppressed because the initial seizure was unlawful. So the answer would be F.

Alternatively, maybe the initial approach was a Terry stop, which requires reasonable suspicion. But when they started conditioning his boarding on the search, they might have needed probable cause to do that, which they didn't have. So the consent was not voluntary.

So looking at the options again, option F says granted because of coercion. Option G says granted because they had no right to prevent boarding. I'm a bit torn between F and G. But the question is about the reason for the motion being granted.

The defendant's attorney is moving to suppress the evidence. The grounds would be that the police's actions were coercive, making the consent invalid. So the motion is granted because the consent was coerced (option F).

Alternatively, if the police had no authority to prevent him from boarding, that's another reason to suppress. But I think the more direct issue is the coercion leading to an involuntary consent.

So I think the correct answer is F: granted because the police coerced the defendant into handing over his bag.

The question revolves around whether the heroin found in the defendant's bag can be admitted as evidence, focusing on Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizures. The key issues are the voluntariness of the defendant's consent to hand over the bag and the legality of the police's actions.

The defendant was detained based on a drug courier profile, which may constitute reasonable suspicion. However, the police told him he couldn't board the plane unless they inspected his bag, which could be seen as coercive. This raises the question of whether the defendant's consent to hand over the bag was voluntary or coerced. If the consent was involuntary due to coercion, the search would be unconstitutional, and the evidence would be suppressed.

The use of a drug-sniffing dog the next day is not considered a search under the Fourth Amendment, but the legality of the police obtaining the bag in the first place is central. If the defendant's consent was coerced, the subsequent search is tainted, and the evidence should be excluded.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option F** correctly identifies that the motion to suppress would likely be granted because the police coerced the defendant into handing over his bag, making the consent involuntary.
- Other options, such as **Option G**, focus on the police's lack of authority to prevent boarding, but the more direct issue is the coercion leading to involuntary consent.

Thus, the motion to suppress is most likely granted because the police coerced the defendant into handing over his bag.

Answer: F
