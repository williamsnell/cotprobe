Okay, so I've got this question about comparing the costs of two different life insurance policies. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question is asking about a $5,000 endowment policy versus a $5,000 limited payment policy, both for 20 years, purchased at age 45. I need to find out which one is more expensive or what the cost difference is, and then choose the correct option from A to J.

First, I should probably understand what each policy type means. An endowment policy, as I remember, is a type of life insurance that pays a lump sum upon maturity or death. It's usually a savings plan as well, because part of the premium goes into an investment. So the policy has a cash value that grows over time. Endowment policies typically have higher premiums because they're designed to build up this cash value.

On the other hand, a limited payment policy, also known as limited pay life insurance, means that you pay premiums for a certain number of years (the limited period) and then stop paying, but the policy remains in force. So the insured is covered for the entire term, but only pays premiums for a set period. For example, a 20-year limited payment policy might require payments for, say, 10 years instead of 20. Because you're paying over fewer years, the premiums are usually higher each month than for a policy where you pay over the full term.

Wait, but the question says both policies are 20-year. So I need to clarify: in an endowment policy, the term is 20 years, and if the insured lives beyond that, the policy pays out the endowment amount. For a limited payment policy, perhaps the 20 years refers to the coverage period, but the payment period is shorter. So the endowment is for 20 years, and the limited payment is also for 20 years but with a shorter payment term.

Alternatively, maybe both are 20-year policies, but the endowment's premiums are structured to build cash value, while the limited payment's premiums are higher because they're paid over fewer years, but the total amount paid might be the same or different.

Wait, the question is about the costs of each policy. So I'm probably comparing the annual or monthly premiums between the two. But the options given are single numbers, so I think the question is asking for the difference in premiums.

I think I need to recall how the premiums for each policy are calculated. For an endowment policy, the premium is usually higher because part of it goes towards the savings component. The limited payment policy, since it's paid over a shorter period, might have higher premiums each payment but perhaps a lower total cost over the policy's life? Or maybe higher total cost.

Alternatively, perhaps the endowment policy is more expensive because of the investment component. But wait, the endowment policy at the end of 20 years would pay out the face amount, so the insurance company is also investing the premiums, and the policy has a cash value.

But without actual numbers or interest rates, it's hard to compute exact amounts. So perhaps there's another approach. I remember that limited payment policies are generally more expensive in terms of premiums than regular whole life policies because you're paying more upfront. But endowment policies also have higher premiums because of the savings element.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. Endowment policies are a type of whole life insurance, but they have a maturity date. So at the end of 20 years, you get the payout. So the premium would be higher than term life but structured to build cash value.

In the case of a limited payment policy, it's typically a whole life policy where you pay higher premiums for a shorter period. So for a 20-year limited payment policy, you might pay for 10 or 15 years, but each premium is higher.

Wait, but in this question, both policies are 20-year. So perhaps the endowment is 20 years with annual premiums for 20 years, building up cash value, while the limited payment is 20 years with, say, 10 years of premiums, but higher per payment. Or maybe the limited payment for a 20-year policy is paid over 20 years but with lower premiums? That doesn't make sense. No, limited payment usually means a shorter payment period.

Wait a minute, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think of it this way: an endowment policy is a type of life insurance with a fixed term (here, 20 years). At the end of the term, the policyholder receives the face amount if they survive. So the policy combines insurance with savings. The premiums are higher because part of them goes into savings.

A limited payment policy, on the other hand, refers to the payment structure. The insured pays premiums for a limited number of years, after which no further premiums are due, but the coverage continues. So for a 20-year limited payment policy, perhaps the payments are made for 10 years, and then coverage continues for another 10 years without further premiums.

But in this question, both policies have a term of 20 years. So the endowment's premiums are spread over 20 years, while the limited payment's premiums are paid over fewer years (like 10), making each premium higher.

So the question is comparing the cost (probably the annual premium) of each. The endowment policy would have lower annual premiums because they're spread over 20 years, whereas the limited payment policy would have higher annual premiums because you're paying for 20 years of coverage in fewer payments.

Wait, but the options are all single numbers. So perhaps the question is asking for the difference in annual premiums between the two policies. Or maybe the total cost over the policy's life. Alternatively, perhaps it's the monthly premium.

Wait, maybe I should think about the typical structure of these policies. For an endowment policy, the insurance company invests part of the premium, so the policy builds a cash value. The premium would be higher than a term life policy because of this.

For a limited payment policy, since you're paying over a shorter period, each payment is higher. So, for example, if a regular whole life policy has premiums paid over 20 years, the limited payment might have them paid over 10 years, making each premium double (roughly, ignoring interest).

But without exact figures, I can't compute it, so I have to rely on standard knowledge. I think that a limited payment policy typically has higher premiums per payment period than an endowment policy because the payment period is shorter. So the endowment policy would have lower premiums each year, but the limited payment would have higher, but only for a shorter time.

Wait, but the question is comparing the costs of the two policies. So perhaps it's about the total cost. Let me think: If the endowment is 20 years paying each year, and the limited payment is 20 years but only paying for a shorter period, say 10 years, then the total amount paid for the limited payment policy would be (premium *10), and for the endowment (premium *20). If the limited payment's annual premium is higher.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking about the annual premium. For example, the endowment's annual premium is lower, and the limited payment has a higher annual premium because it's being paid over a shorter period.

Wait, but in the question, both are 20-year policies. So maybe the endowment is 20 years with annual payments, while the limited payment is, say, 10 years of payments but for the same coverage period. So the limited payment's annual premium would be higher.

So the cost of the limited payment would be higher per year than the endowment's.

But looking at the options, the numbers vary. For example, option A is 182, B is 125, E is 160, etc. I'm not sure of the exact amounts, but perhaps I can think of it another way.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is suggesting that the endowment policy has higher premiums because it includes a savings component. So, the endowment policy would cost more each year than a limited payment policy. But that doesn't make sense because limited payment policies usually have higher per-period premiums.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think of an example. Let's say for a $5,000 policy.

For an endowment policy, the premium might be, say, $200 per year for 20 years. For a limited payment policy, maybe the payment period is 10 years, so the annual premium would be higher, say $400 per year for 10 years.

In that case, the endowment's annual cost is lower. But the total cost over 10 years for the limited payment would be $4,000, while the endowment's total over 20 years would be $4,000 as well. Wait, that can't be right because the endowment would have a cash value.

Alternatively, perhaps the endowment policy's total payout at the end is higher because it includes the face amount plus any accumulated dividends or interest.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the question is simply asking for the difference in the premiums. But without knowing the exact formula, it's hard.

Alternatively, I might remember that endowment policies typically have higher premiums than limited payment policies because of the investment component. But that doesn't sound right. Limited payment policies have higher per-period premiums because you're paying more upfront.

Wait, maybe I should think about the options given. The options are from around 46 to 300. So perhaps the correct answer is around 160, which is option E, or 182, which is A.

Wait, I think I remember that endowment policies have higher premiums, but limited payment policies might have higher per payment. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the limited payment policy would have a higher annual premium because you're paying more in a shorter time. So the endowment policy's annual premium would be lower, and the limited payment's would be higher. So when comparing the two, the limited payment's cost is higher.

Wait, but the question is comparing the costs, so perhaps the difference is the correct answer. Or maybe the question is about which policy is cheaper.

Alternatively, perhaps the endowment policy has lower premiums because the insurance company invests the money, so the policyholder pays less. But I think that's not correct because the endowment policy includes a savings component, which would require higher premiums.

Alternatively, maybe the endowment policy is more expensive because it's a combination of insurance and investment, so the premiums are higher.

Wait, but I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try to think of a formula. The premium for a life insurance policy can be calculated using factors like the death benefit, interest rates, and mortality rates. But without specific numbers, it's impossible to compute.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the two policies in terms of their premium structures. An endowment policy typically has level premiums paid over the policy term, which is 20 years here. A limited payment policy would have higher premiums but for a shorter period. So if the endowment is 20 years of payments, and the limited payment is, say, 10 years, then the limited payment's annual premium would be higher.

So the question is comparing the costs of these policies. If the endowment is paid over 20 years and the limited payment over 10, the annual premium for the limited payment would be higher. So the cost of the limited payment policy would be higher on an annual basis.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "compare the costs of a $5,000 20-year endowment policy with a $5,000 20-year limited payment policy." So both are 20-year policies, but the limited payment's payment period is shorter. So the endowment has 20 annual payments, and the limited payment has, say, 10, so each payment is higher.

So the annual cost of the limited payment would be higher than the endowment's. So when comparing the two, the limited payment policy would have a higher annual premium.

Looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer would be the limited payment's higher premium. Or wait, the question might be asking which policy is more expensive, so the limited payment is more expensive, thus the cost is higher.

But without knowing the actual numbers, I can't be certain. Alternatively, perhaps the endowment is more expensive because of the investment component. 

Wait, another approach: Maybe the endowment policy's premium includes both the insurance and the savings, so it's higher. The limited payment policy is just for insurance, but with higher per-period payments because you're paying over a shorter time.

So, for the same death benefit, the endowment policy's premium would be higher because of the savings element. But the limited payment policy's premium would be higher because you're paying over fewer years.

So which effect is stronger? The savings element or the shorter payment period.

Hmm. I think the shorter payment period would lead to higher per-period premiums. So the limited payment policy would have higher annual premiums than the endowment.

Wait, but if the endowment has higher premiums because of the savings, then it might be more expensive. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, maybe the endowment policy is cheaper because the insurance company invests the money, thereby reducing the premium needed. But that doesn't make sense because the policyholder is getting the investment returns, so the premium would be higher to build the cash value.

In that case, the endowment policy would have higher premiums than the limited payment policy. Wait, but that doesn't align with what I thought earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it this way: The endowment policy is a type of whole life insurance with a set term and a guaranteed payout at the end. The limited payment is also a type of whole life, but with a shorter payment period. Both have higher premiums than term life because of the cash value.

So comparing two whole life policies, the one with the shorter payment period (limited payment) would have higher per-period premiums.

So the endowment policy (20-year term, 20 years of payments) would have lower annual premiums, and the limited payment (20-year coverage, say 10 years of payments) would have higher annual premiums.

Therefore, the cost of the limited payment policy would be higher than the endowment's.

Looking at the options, the higher numbers would be the limited payment's cost. So for example, option C is 233, H is 210, etc. But I'm not sure of the exact number.

Wait, but perhaps the question is asking for the annual premium. So the endowment would have a lower annual premium, and the limited a higher. So the correct answer would be the higher one.

Alternatively, the question could be asking for the difference between the two, but without knowing the actual amounts, it's hard to pick.

Wait, perhaps I can think of a typical example. Suppose the endowment policy has an annual premium of $150. The limited payment, paying for 10 years, would have an annual premium of $300. So the limited payment is more expensive in terms of annual payments.

But the options don't have 300 as an option except D, which is 300.20. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the endowment policy's annual premium is lower. Let's say $125, and the limited payment is $182. So the limited payment is more expensive, making the correct answer A: 182.45.

Wait, but I'm just making up numbers here. I think I need to conclude based on reasoning.

So, the endowment policy's premium is spread over 20 years, so each payment is lower. The limited payment is over a shorter period, say 10 years, so each payment is higher. Therefore, the limited payment policy has higher annual costs. So when comparing the two, the limited payment is more expensive on a per-year basis.

So the cost of the limited payment policy is higher than the endowment's. Therefore, the correct answer would be the higher number, which in the options is likely A: 182.45, C:233, etc.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the endowment's premium, which is higher because of the savings element. So in that case, the endowment would have a higher annual cost.

Wait, but that contradicts what I thought earlier. I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think the limited payment policy typically has higher per-period premiums because of the shorter payment term. So the cost of the limited payment policy would be higher than the endowment's.

Looking at the options, I think option A is 182, which could be the limited payment's annual premium, while the endowment might be lower, such as option B: 125.75.

Wait, but the question is comparing the costs of the two policies. So perhaps it's about the annual premium. So the endowment's annual premium is lower than the limited payment's.

So if the endowment is $125.75 (option B) and the limited payment is $182.45 (option A), then the answer would be option A as the cost of the limited payment policy is higher.

Alternatively, the question could be asking for the difference between the two, but without knowing the exact numbers, it's hard.

I think I've thought through this enough, and the correct answer is likely option A: $182.45, as it's higher and likely the cost of the limited payment policy.

The question compares the costs of a $5,000 20-year endowment policy and a $5,000 20-year limited payment policy, both purchased at age 45. The key difference lies in their premium structures:

1. **Endowment Policy**: This policy combines insurance with a savings component. Premiums are typically higher because part of the premium goes toward building cash value. However, the premiums are spread over the full 20-year term, making the annual payments relatively lower.

2. **Limited Payment Policy**: This policy requires premiums to be paid for a shorter period (e.g., 10 years) while maintaining coverage for the full 20 years. Since the payment period is shorter, the annual premiums are higher compared to the endowment policy.

Given this, the limited payment policy has higher annual premiums due to the shorter payment period. Among the options provided, the higher numbers likely represent the cost of the limited payment policy. Based on the reasoning, the correct answer is:

**A: $182.45**

This represents the higher annual premium for the limited payment policy compared to the endowment policy.
