Okay, so I've got this problem about fluid mechanics, specifically dealing with boundary layers on a ship. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to think this through.

The question gives me a ship moving at 7.59 knots relative to still water. Wait, knots is a unit of speed, right? I remember that 1 knot is approximately 1.6878 feet per second. So first, I need to convert that speed into ft/s because the other units are in feet and slugs.

So, 7.59 knots multiplied by 1.6878 ft/s per knot. Let me calculate that. 7.59 * 1.6878... 7 * 1.6878 is about 11.8146, and 0.59 * 1.6878 is roughly 1.00 (because 0.5*1.6878≈0.8439 and 0.09*1.6878≈0.1519, so total about 0.9958). So adding 11.8146 + 0.9958 gives around 12.81 ft/s. Wait, wait, maybe I should do it more accurately. Let me compute 7.59 * 1.6878. Let's see: 7 * 1.6878 is 11.8146. 0.59 * 1.6878: 0.5 * 1.6878 is 0.8439, 0.09 is about 0.1519. So 0.8439 + 0.1519 = 0.9958. So total is 11.8146 + 0.9958 = 12.8104 ft/s. So the speed is approximately 12.81 ft/s.

Next, the problem says the maximum Reynolds number R_x is 5e5, beyond which the flow becomes turbulent. So we need to find the distance downstream from the bow where R_x equals 5e5. Then, using that point, determine the boundary layer thickness and the friction drag coefficient.

Reynolds number is given by Re = (u * x) / ν, where u is the velocity, x is the distance, and ν is the kinematic viscosity.

Wait, but wait, the formula for Reynolds number in boundary layer is Re_x = (u_infinity * x) / ν. So here, u_infinity is the free stream velocity, which is 12.81 ft/s. So when Re_x equals 5e5, we can solve for x.

So rearranging, x = (Re_x * ν) / u.

Given that Re_x is 5e5, ν is 1.21e-5 ft²/s.

So plugging in numbers: x = (5e5) * (1.21e-5) / 12.81.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 5e5 * 1.21e-5 = 5 * 1.21 * 1e5 * 1e-5 => 5*1.21=6.05, and 1e5 *1e-5=1e0=1. So 6.05 * 1 = 6.05.

Then, divide by 12.81: 6.05 /12.81.

Let me calculate that. 12.81 goes into 6.05 about 0.473 times. So x ≈ 0.473 ft.

Looking at the options, I see option E has 0.47 ft, which is very close. So x is approximately 0.47 ft.

Okay, so the first part is probably 0.47 ft. Now, the second part is the boundary layer thickness at this point. Hmm.

Wait, the boundary layer thickness for laminar flow is given by the Blasius solution, which is δ = (4.91 ν x) / (u). Or wait, is it δ = (4.91 x) / sqrt(Re_x)? Because I remember that for laminar flow, the boundary layer thickness δ is approximately (4.91 x) / sqrt(Re_x).

But wait, since Re_x is 5e5, sqrt(5e5) is sqrt(5)*sqrt(1e5). sqrt(1e5)=sqrt(10^5)=10^(2.5)=316.227766. So sqrt(5) is about 2.236, so 2.236 * 316.227766 ≈ 707.1.

So δ = 4.91 * x / 707.1.

Wait, x is 0.473 ft. So 4.91 * 0.473 ≈ let me calculate that.

4.91 * 0.4 is 1.964, 4.91 * 0.073 is approximately 0.358. So total ≈ 2.322.

Then, 2.322 divided by 707.1 is approximately 0.003285 ft. So about 0.003285 ft, which is 0.0102 ft when converted to 3 decimal places? Wait wait, wait. Wait, 0.003285 ft is 0.003285 *12 inches = 0.03942 inches, but the options are in feet. So 0.00328 ft is 0.00328 ft, but looking at the options, for example, option E has 0.0102 ft. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another approach: maybe the formula is δ = (5 ν x)/(u * sqrt(Re_x)) ) ? Or perhaps I should think in terms of the formula for the Blasius boundary layer.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The Blasius solution gives the boundary layer thickness as δ = (4.91 x) / sqrt(Re_x). But Re_x is (u x)/ν. So substituting:

Wait, but Re_x = u x / ν → so sqrt(Re_x) = sqrt(u x / ν).

So the formula becomes δ = (4.91 x) / sqrt( (u x)/ν ) ) = 4.91 x * sqrt(ν/(u x))) = 4.91 * sqrt( ν x / u ).

Wait, that can't be right. Alternatively, let me think of it as:

Re_x = (u x) / ν → rearranged, ν = (u x)/Re_x.

So substituting into δ:

δ = (4.91 x) / sqrt( (u x)/ν ) )

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it directly.

Given x is 0.473 ft, u is 12.81 ft/s, ν is 1.21e-5 ft²/s.

Compute Re_x: (12.81 * 0.473) / 1.21e-5.

Wait, that's (12.81 *0.473) = let's see, 12 *0.473=5.676, 0.81*0.473≈0.383, so total about 6.059. So Re_x = 6.059 / 1.21e-5 → approximately 6.059 / 0.0000121 = let me compute that. 6.059 / 0.0000121 → 6.059 /1.21e-5 → approximately 500, 000. Because 6e5 *1e-5 is 6. So 6.059 /1.21e-5 is about 5e5, which makes sense because that's the given Re_x.

So for Re_x =5e5, δ is 4.91 x / sqrt(Re_x). So x=0.473 ft, Re_x=5e5.

So sqrt(5e5)=sqrt(5)*sqrt(1e5)=2.23607 * 316.228≈707.1068.

So δ=4.91 * 0.473 /707.1068.

4.91 *0.473: Let me calculate that. 4 *0.473=1.892, 0.91*0.473≈0.430. So total ≈2.322.

2.322 /707.1068 ≈0.003284 ft. Wait, that's 0.003284 ft, which is 0.003284 ft ≈0.0394 inches. But looking at the options, the boundary layer thickness is in the options like 0.0102 ft, which is much larger. So something's wrong here.

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Perhaps the correct formula for boundary layer thickness is (5/√(Re_x)) * x? Or another approach. Wait, I think I might have confused the formulas for drag coefficient and thickness.

Wait, another approach: the formula for the boundary layer thickness in laminar flow is δ = (4.91 ν x)/(u) * sqrt(Re_x)? No, that doesn't make sense. Let me check the correct formula.

I recall that the Blasius solution gives the boundary layer thickness δ as:

δ = (4.91 x) / sqrt(Re_x)

So with Re_x =5e5, x=0.473 ft.

So δ=4.91 *0.473 / sqrt(5e5).

Wait, sqrt(5e5)=707.1068 as before.

So 4.91 * 0.473= approximately 2.321.

2.321 /707.1068≈0.00328 ft, which is 0.00328 ft.

Wait, but that's 0.00328 ft, which is 0.0394 inches. But the options give, for example, option E as 0.0102 ft, which is about 0.122 inches. Hmm, that's a big difference. So perhaps I made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that after the boundary layer becomes turbulent, the thickness is calculated differently. But no, the question is asking at the point where Re_x=5e5, which is the transition point. So perhaps at that point, it's the end of the laminar region, so the thickness would be as per the Blasius solution.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should compute the thickness using the formula for average velocity or something else. Alternatively, perhaps I'm using the wrong approach for the boundary layer thickness.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the momentum thickness, but the question just says boundary layer thickness, which is the same as the 99% thickness, the δ.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check.

The Blasius solution gives the boundary layer thickness δ as:

δ = (4.91 x) / sqrt(Re_x)

So plugging in the numbers:

x =0.473 ft,

Re_x=5e5,

so sqrt(Re_x)=707.1068.

So δ=4.91 * 0.473 /707.1068.

Let me compute 4.91 *0.473 first.

4.91 * 0.4 =1.964,

4.91 * 0.073= approx 0.358,

Total= 1.964 + 0.358=2.322.

2.322 /707.1068= approx 0.003284 ft.

Wait, that's 0.003284 ft, which is 0.00328 ft.

Looking at the options, the E option has 0.0102 ft.

Hmm, that's way off. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses a different value. Another source says that the boundary layer thickness for a flat plate in laminar flow is approximately δ = 5 x / sqrt(Re_x). Oh wait, maybe I used 4.91 instead of 5? Let me try that.

If δ =5 x / sqrt(Re_x), then it's 5 *0.473 /707.1068.

5 *0.473=2.365.

2.365 /707.1068≈0.003345 ft.

Still about 0.00334 ft, which is still not matching any of the options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Another thought: maybe the formula I'm using is for momentum thickness, not the actual boundary layer thickness. Because I've heard that the momentum thickness θ is given by θ=(0.664 x)/sqrt(Re_x). And the boundary layer thickness δ is about 3 times θ, approximately. So let's try that.

So θ=0.664 x /sqrt(Re_x).

θ=0.664 *0.473 /707.1068.

0.664 *0.473≈0.314.

0.314 /707.1068≈0.0004438 ft.

Then, δ≈3θ≈0.001331 ft. That's even smaller. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the formulas. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute Re_x, find x, then compute the boundary layer thickness using the correct formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is δ = (5 ν x)/u. Let me try that.

ν is 1.21e-5 ft²/s.

So (5 *1.21e-5 *0.473) /12.81.

Compute numerator:5 *1.21e-5=6.05e-5.

6.05e-5 *0.473= approx 2.86e-5.

Divide by 12.81: 2.86e-5 /12.81≈2.23e-6 ft. That's way too small.

No, that can't be right. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the correct formula is δ = (4.91 * ν^(1/2) * x^(1/2)) ) / u^(1/2).

Let me try that.

So ν=1.21e-5 ft²/s.

So sqrt(ν)=sqrt(1.21e-5)=0.00349 ft²^0.5/s^0.5.

x=0.473 ft.

So sqrt(x)=0.688 ft^0.5.

u=12.81 ft/s, so sqrt(u)=3.58 ft^0.5/s^0.5.

So putting it all together:

δ =4.91 * (0.00349) * (0.688) / (3.58).

Compute numerator: 4.91 *0.00349=0.017149.

0.017149 *0.688≈0.01181.

Denominator:3.58.

So δ≈0.01181 /3.58≈0.0033 ft.

Same as before. So again, about 0.0033 ft.

But none of the options have a thickness near 0.0033 ft. The options have values like 0.0102 ft, 0.0115 ft, etc.

Wait, so maybe I'm using the wrong approach. Let's try another angle.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the boundary layer as turbulent beyond Re_x=5e5, so at Re_x=5e5, perhaps the calculation is a bit different. Or maybe I should use the formula for turbulent flow after x is determined.

Wait, but no, at exactly Re_x=5e5, it's the transition point, so the flow is just becoming turbulent. So the boundary layer up to that point is laminar, and beyond that, it's turbulent. So the thickness at x=0.473 ft is still the laminar thickness.

Hmm, but in that case, why the options have a much larger thickness.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of x. Let me recheck the calculation for x.

Re_x =5e5 = (u x)/ν → x= (Re_x * ν )/u.

u=12.81 ft/s, Re_x=5e5, ν=1.21e-5.

So x=(5e5 *1.21e-5)/12.81.

Compute numerator:5e5=500,000; 500,000 *1.21e-5=500,000 *0.0000121=6.05.

Then, 6.05 /12.81= approx 0.472 ft. So that's correct.

So x is about 0.472 ft, which I approximated as 0.473 ft.

So perhaps the confusion is somewhere else. Let me think about the boundary layer thickness formula again.

Another approach: I'm using the formula for a flat plate with a laminar boundary layer. The standard formula is δ = (4.91 x) / sqrt(Re_x).

Wait, but let me compute that again.

x=0.472 ft,

Re_x=5e5.

sqrt(5e5)=707.1068.

So δ=4.91 *0.472 /707.1068.

4.91 *0.472=2.319.

2.319 /707.1068≈0.00328 ft.

Hmm. So that's 0.00328 ft, which is 0.0394 inches, but the options don't have this. So maybe I'm missing a factor of 1000 somewhere? No, because the units are in feet.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in converting knots to ft/s. Let me check.

1 knot = 1 nautical mile per hour = 1.15078 miles per hour. Wait, no, 1 knot is 1.6878 feet per second. Let me verify.

Yes, 1 knot is 1 nautical mile per hour. 1 nautical mile is 1852 meters, which is 6076.115 feet. So 6076.115 feet per hour divided by 3600 seconds is approx 1.6878 ft/s. So 7.59 knots would be 7.59 * 1.6878 = approximately 12.81 ft/s. So that part was correct.

Wait, let me check if the options have 0.47 ft for x. Option E is 0.47 ft, which matches. Then, the thickness is 0.0102 ft. But according to my calculations, it's 0.00328 ft. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula for the thickness in turbulent flow, but that doesn't make sense because up to x=0.47 ft, the flow is laminar. Oh wait, unless the question is considering that beyond this point, the flow is turbulent, but at this exact point, the flow is just transitioning.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different formula for the boundary layer thickness.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula uses (4.91 * x) / (sqrt(Re_x)), but in feet units, perhaps I should have considered something else. Alternatively, maybe I'm using the wrong value for the coefficient.

Wait, another source says that for a flat plate, the boundary layer thickness is given by δ = (5 x)/(
