Question:

Which of the following statements is incorrect regarding fatty acid ß-oxidation?


Options:

A: The rate of ß-oxidation is regulated by the availability of carbohydrates and the rate of utilisation of ß-oxidation products
B: Peroxisomes are the site for the degradation of xenobiotics and eicosanoids
C: Within the liver peroxisomes serve to oxidise very long chain fatty acids to medium chain products
D: The rate of b-oxidation is regulated by the availability of fatty acids and the rate of utilisation of b-oxidation products
E: The major site of fatty acid ß-oxidation is the peroxisomes, the mitochondria also contain enzymes for this pathway

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which statement is incorrect regarding fatty acid beta-oxidation. Hmm, beta-oxidation is the process where fatty acids are broken down to generate energy, right? I remember that it mainly happens in the mitochondria, but wait, peroxisomes are involved too, especially for very long chain fatty acids.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the rate is regulated by carbohydrate availability and the use of beta-oxidation products. I think that's true because when carbs are abundant, fatty acid oxidation might decrease. Also, if the products (like acetyl-CoA) are being used up, beta-oxidation would increase. So A might be correct.

Option B states peroxisomes handle degradation of xenobiotics and eicosanoids. I remember peroxisomes have enzymes for breaking down certain drugs (xenobiotics) and eicosanoids like prostaglandins. So B is correct.

Option C: Liver peroxisomes oxidize very long chain fatty acids to medium chains. Yes, I think that's right. Very long chain fatty acids are first broken down in peroxisomes to medium chains, which are then transported to mitochondria for further oxidation. So C is correct.

Option D: Rate is regulated by fatty acid availability and product utilization. That makes sense because if there are plenty of fatty acids, they'll be oxidized. Also, if the products are being used (like in the citric acid cycle), beta-oxidation would continue. So D is correct.

Option E says the major site is peroxisomes, and mitochondria also have enzymes. Wait, no. I'm pretty sure mitochondria are the major site for beta-oxidation, especially for medium and long chains. Peroxisomes handle very long chains but aren't the major site. So E is incorrect because it says peroxisomes are the major site, which isn't right. So the incorrect statement is E.

The incorrect statement regarding fatty acid ß-oxidation is:

**E: The major site of fatty acid ß-oxidation is the peroxisomes, the mitochondria also contain enzymes for this pathway.**

This is incorrect because the mitochondria are the major site of fatty acid ß-oxidation, particularly for medium and long-chain fatty acids. While peroxisomes play a role in oxidizing very long-chain fatty acids to medium-chain products, they are not the primary site of this process.

Answer: E
