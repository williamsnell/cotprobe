Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question says: A 60-ohm electric lamp is left connected to a 240-volt line for 3.00 minutes. How much energy is taken from the line? And there are multiple-choice options from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with electrical energy, the key concepts are probably voltage, current, resistance, power, and energy. Oh right, power is the rate at which energy is used, and energy is power multiplied by time.

First, I think I need to find the current flowing through the lamp. Ohm's Law comes into play here. Ohm's Law says V = I * R, so I can rearrange that to find current I = V / R.

The voltage V is given as 240 volts, and the resistance R is 60 ohms. So plugging those numbers in, I = 240 / 60. Let me calculate that. 240 divided by 60 is 4. So the current is 4 amperes.

Next step is to find the power. Power in an electrical context can be calculated using P = V * I. So that's 240 volts multiplied by 4 amperes. 240 * 4 is 960 watts. So the power is 960 watts.

Wait, but sometimes I also remember another formula for power when dealing with resistance: P = I² * R or P = V² / R. Maybe I should double-check using one of those. Let's try P = V squared over R. 240 squared is 57600. Divided by 60 gives 57600 / 60 = 960 watts. Yep, same result. So that's consistent. So power is definitely 960 W.

Now, energy is power multiplied by time. But wait, the time given is in minutes, and power is in watts, which is joules per second. So I need to convert the time into seconds.

3 minutes is 3 * 60 seconds, which is 180 seconds.

So energy E = power * time. That would be 960 W * 180 s. Let me calculate that. 960 * 180... Hmm, 960 * 180. Let's break it down: 960 * 100 is 96,000, 960 * 80 is 76,800. Wait, no, wait. 180 is 100 + 80, so 960*100=96,000 and 960*80=76,800. Adding them together gives 172,800. Wait, no, wait, that can't be right because 960 * 180 is the same as 960 * (2*90) = 1920 * 90. Wait, maybe I should think of it as 960 * 180 = (900 + 60) * 180. No, perhaps a better approach is to calculate 960 * 180.

Alternatively, 960 * 180 = 960 * (1.8 * 10^2) )= (960 * 1.8) * 10^2. 960 * 1.8: 960 * 1 is 960, 960 * 0.8 is 768. So 960 + 768 = 1728. Multiply by 10^2 gives 1728 * 100 = 172800. So 172,800 joules. Wait, but looking at the options, they're in 1e4 ranges. So 172800 is 1.728e5 J, which is 1.728 × 10^5 J. But looking at the options, none of them are that high. Hmm, that's confusing. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, let me go back. Oh wait, I think I messed up the time. Let me check the units again. Oh no, wait, the time was 3 minutes, which is 180 seconds. So 960 * 180 is indeed 172800 J, which is 1.728e5 J. But the options are all in the 1e4 or 2e4 range. So I must have done something wrong.

Wait, maybe I used the wrong formula for energy. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate energy using another method. Let me think. Energy can also be calculated as E = I² R t. Let's try that. I is 4 A, R is 60 ohms, t is 180 seconds.

So I squared is 16, multiplied by R (60) gives 16 *60 = 960. Then multiplied by t (180) gives 960 * 180 = 172800 J. Same result. Hmm, but none of the options match that.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake with the time? Let me check again. 3 minutes is 3 * 60 = 180 seconds. That's correct.

So why are the options so much smaller? Let me look at the options again. The options go up to J: 2.4e4 J, which is 24,000 J. But my calculation is 172,800 J. That's more than ten times larger. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I confused the resistance and voltage somewhere. Let me check the given values again. The lamp is 60 ohms connected to 240 volts. So V=240, R=60. So I=4 A, that's correct. Power is 960 W, correct.

Wait, am I sure about the time? Oh wait, perhaps the problem is that the time is in minutes but I thought it's in seconds. Wait no, I did convert 3 minutes to 180 seconds. So that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should have used a different approach. Wait, maybe the question is asking for energy in a different unit? No, it's in joules.

Hmm, perhaps I made a calculation error. Let me calculate 960 * 180 again.

960 * 180: Let me think 180 is 18 * 10. 960 * 18 = let's compute that. 960 * 10=9600, 960 *8=7680. So 9600 + 7680=17280. Then 17280 *10 = 172800. So yes, correct. So 172,800 J.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A: 1.2e4 = 12,000 J

B: 3.6e4=36,000 J

C:2.2e4=22,000

D:1.72e4=17,200

E:1.9e4=19,000

F:2.0e4=20,000

G:1.5e4=15,000

H:1.0e4=10,000

I:1.8e4=18,000

J:2.4e4=24,000.

Wait none of these are near 172,800 J. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me think again. Oh wait, maybe it's using the formula E = V^2 * t / R. Let me try that.

E = (240)^2 * 180 / 60.

240 squared is 57,600. Multiply by 180: 57,600 *180. Hmm, that's 57,600 * 180 = let's see, 57,600 * 100=5,760,000; 57,600 *80=4,608,000. So total is 5,760,000 + 4,608,000 =10,368,000. Then divide by 60: 10,368,000 /60 = 172,800 J. Same result.

So same answer again. So why doesn't any option match that?

Wait, perhaps the question is in kilojoules? No, the question says Joules.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the power. Let me check again. P=V^2/R = (240)^2 /60 =57600/60=960 W. Correct.

Wait, but 960 W is 960 Joules per second. Multiply by 180 seconds gives 172,800 J.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the current. Let me see: V=240, R=60. So I=240/60=4 A. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for power instead of energy? No, the question is about energy taken from the line.

Wait another thought: Maybe the time is in minutes but I treated it as seconds? Wait no, I converted 3 minutes to 180 seconds, which is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should have converted the time into hours instead? Because sometimes energy is calculated in watt-hours. Oh wait, 1 watt-hour is 3600 joules. So if I calculate energy in watt-hours first.

Power is 960 W. Time is 3 minutes, which is 3/60 hours = 0.05 hours. So energy is 960 *0.05 =48 watt-hours. 48 Wh * 3600 J/Wh = 172,800 J. Same result.

So I'm confident the correct answer should be 172800 J, which is 1.728e5 J. But none of the options are near that. So perhaps I've made a mistake in reading the question.

Wait, let me read the question again. Oh wait, the question says "for 3.00 min" — that's 3 minutes. And the resistance is 60 ohms. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong value for voltage. Wait, 240 volts — correct.

Wait, maybe the lamp isn't purely resistive? No, the problem states it's an electric lamp, which I assume is purely resistive.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for power, not energy? No, the question is about energy taken from the line.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents. Let me look at the options again. Oh wait, option J is 2.4e4 J, which is 24,000 J. That's much less than my result. So perhaps I made a calculation error.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the energy. Let me try again.

Power P = 960 W. Time t=180 s. So E= P*t =960 *180.

Let me compute 960 * 180 step by step.

First, 900 * 180 = 162,000.

Then 60 * 180 = 10,800.

Add them together: 162,000 +10,800 =172,800 J.

Same result. So that's correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them are anywhere near that. So perhaps the question was mistyped, or I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the time is 3 seconds instead of 3 minutes? If that were the case, then E=960 *3= 2880 J, which is 2.88e3 J, which still doesn't match any of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the resistance is 600 ohms? Let me see: If R=600, then I=240/600=0.4 A. Power P= V*I=240 *0.4=96 W. Then E=96 *180=17,280 J, which is 1.728e4 J. Looking at the options, D is 1.72e4. That would be close.

But the question says 60 ohms, not 600. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong formula. Let me think again. Another formula for power is P= I^2 R.

I is 4 A, R=60 ohms. So P= (4)^2 *60=16 *60=960 W. Correct.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the energy in kilowatt-hours? No, energy is in joules.

Hmm, I'm really stuck here. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate energy using E=V*I*t.

V=240, I=4, t=180.

So E=240 *4 *180.

240 *4=960.

960 *180= 172,800 J. Same result.

But the options don't have that. So I'm confused. Maybe the correct answer isn't among the options. But that can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, perhaps the question is using 3 minutes but I converted it to seconds correctly.

Wait, another approach: Let's find the energy in watt-hours first, then convert to joules.

Power is 960 W, which is 960 J/s. Time is 180 s. So energy is 960 *180 =172,800 J.

Alternatively, 960 W is 1 kW (since 1 kW is 1000 W, but 960 is close). So 0.96 kW.

Time is 3 minutes, which is 3/60 =0.05 hours.

Energy in kWh is 0.96 *0.05 =0.048 kWh.

Convert to joules: 1 kWh =3.6e6 J. So 0.048 *3.6e6 = 0.048 *3,600,000.

0.048 *3,600,000= 172,800 J.

Same result. So I'm confident that's correct. But the options don't match. So perhaps the correct option isn't listed? Or maybe I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with the exponent. Let me see the options again. Oh wait, the options are in terms of 1e4, which is 10,000. My result is 172,800, which is 1.728e5 J, or 17.28e4 J. None of the options are close.

Wait, perhaps the question had a typo and the resistance is 600 ohms instead of 60. Then, I would have I=240/600=0.4 A. P=240 *0.4=96 W. E=96 *180=17,280 J, which is 1.728e4 J. That matches option D, which is 1.72e4.

But the question says 60 ohms. So perhaps it's a typo, but I have to go with what's given.

Alternatively, perhaps I miscalculated the current. Wait, wait, no—oh wait, no, 240/60 is definitely 4.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the voltage is 240 Vrms, but the power calculation uses peak values. But no, for resistive loads, the average power is Vrms * Irms, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for energy in different units, like kilojoules, but the question says Joules.

Wait, perhaps the time is in milliseconds? No, the question says 3.00 min.

I'm really stuck. Unless I made a mistake in my initial calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should check if 240 V is the peak voltage, not RMS. But for a resistive load, the power depends on RMS. But since the problem doesn't specify AC, I think it's DC, so RMS and peak are same.

So, all in all, I think my calculation is correct, but the given options don't include it. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, another approach: Perhaps the question is asking for the energy in a different way. Let me see the options again.

Wait, option I is 1.8e4 J, which is 18,000 J. That's about a tenth of my result. So if I had used t=18 seconds instead of 180 seconds, which would be 0.3 minutes, that would give 960 *18=17,280 J, which is 1.7e4. Close to option D.

But the time is 3 minutes, not 0.3.

Wait, perhaps I missed a decimal point somewhere. Let me check: 240 V, yes. 60 ohms, yes. I=4 A, yes.

Wait, another thought—could the question have the voltage as 24 V instead of 240? Then, I would be 24/60=0.4 A. Power would be 24 *0.4=9.6 W. Energy would be 9.6 *180=1728 J=1.7e3 J, which still doesn't match any option except perhaps option D if it's 1.7e4. No.

Alternatively, perhaps the question has a typo and the time is 30 seconds. Then energy would be 960 *30=28,800 J=2.88e4. Closest option is J:2.4e4, but not exact.

Wait, but the question says 3 minutes, which is 180 seconds. So I'm back to square one.

Hmm. I'm really stuck. I'm confident my calculation is correct, but none of the options match. Maybe I should consider whether I'm using the correct formula.

Wait, another formula: E = V^2 * t / R.

V=240, R=60, t=180.

E=(240^2 * 180)/60.

240^2 is 57,600.

57,600 *180 =10,368,000.

Divide by 60: 10,368,000 /60= 172,800 J.

Same result.

I think I've exhausted all possibilities. Unless the question intended the energy to be 1728 J, but that's not matching any option.

Wait, perhaps I should recheck the initial data. Oh wait, the resistance is 60 ohms. Ohm's Law is correct. So I think I'm right, but the options don't include the correct answer.

Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps I misread them. Let me check again:

Options:

A: 1.2 × 1e4 =12,000

B:3.6e4=36,000

C:2.2e4=22,000

D:1.72e4=17,200

E:1.9e4=19,000

F:2.0e4=20,000

G:1.5e4=15,000

H:1.0e4=10,000

I:1.8e4=18,000

J:2.4e4=24,000.

Wait, none of these match 172,800. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options. But that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake with the exponent. Let me compute 172800 in terms of 1e4.

172800 =17.28e3 =1.728e4 *10. So 1.728e5 J. Which would be 17.28e4 J.

But the options only go up to 2.4e4.

Wait, perhaps I should check if I used the correct exponent when calculating. Oh
