Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out which expression represents "3 fewer than a number p." Hmm, let's break this down. 

First, the phrase is about something being fewer than a number. So, I think "fewer than" means subtraction. Like, if I have a number and I take away some amount, that's fewer. So in this case, it's 3 fewer than p.

Wait, so if p is the number, and I subtract 3 from it, that would give me 3 fewer than p. So the expression would be p minus 3. Let me make sure I'm not mixing this up. Sometimes these phrases can be tricky.

Let me think of an example. Suppose p is 10. Then 3 fewer than 10 would be 10 - 3, which is 7. So the expression should take 10 and give 7. Looking at the options, I need to find which one does that.

Looking at the options provided:

A: p%3 → That's the modulus, which gives the remainder when p is divided by 3. Doesn't fit because we're not talking about remainders here.

B: p+3 → That's adding 3, which would be 3 more than p, not fewer. So no.

C: 3^p → That's 3 raised to the power of p. Definitely not subtraction.

D: p-3 → Oh, that's exactly what I thought. Subtracting 3 from p gives 3 fewer than p. This seems right.

E: 3/p → That's dividing 3 by p. Not related to the phrase.

F: p^3 → p cubed. Again, exponentiation, not subtraction.

G: p*3 → Multiplying p by 3. That's three times p, not 3 fewer.

H: 3*p → Same as G, because multiplication is commutative. So 3*p is same as p*3. Not what we want.

I: 3-p → Wait, that's subtracting p from 3. So if p is 10, 3-10 is -7, which is different from 10-3 being 7. So this is the opposite of what we want.

J: p/3 → Dividing p by 3. Not relevant here.

So the correct option should be D: p-3.

The phrase "3 fewer than a number, p" indicates subtraction. Subtracting 3 from p results in the expression p - 3. Among the given options, D matches this expression.

Answer: D
