Okay, so I've got this question about Leopold and his views on the environment. Hmm, I remember Leopold wrote "A Sand County Almanac", which is a big deal in environmental ethics. Let me think about what he said.

The question asks which claim Leopold would clearly accept. The options are A through D. Let's go through each.

Option A says the problems with how we use the environment concern how humans treat each other. Wait, Leopold was more about the land ethic, right? He believed that humans should consider themselves part of the biotic community, not just focused on each other. So A might not be his main point. He might agree that human relations matter, but I'm not sure if he'd say it's the ultimate concern.

Option B suggests thinking about the balance of nature. I recall Leopold talking about the land as a community and the importance of maintaining its integrity. The balance of nature fits into that idea, so B might be something he'd accept.

Option C states that environmental problems aren't just economic issues. Oh yeah, Leopold was critical of treating land as a commodity. He argued for a land ethic that goes beyond economics, so C sounds right. He definitely didn't think it was merely an economic problem.

Option D says we should ignore all economic motives. Wait, Leopold might not go that far. He wanted to balance economic use with ecological health, not completely ignore economics. So D is probably too extreme for him.

So the options I think are between B and C. Let me think deeper. Leopold's land pyramid concept includes all components of the ecosystem. He emphasized the interconnectedness, which relates to the balance of nature. So B could be a point he'd make.

But wait, the question is which claim he would "clearly accept". His main point was about ethics beyond just economics. So C says the problems aren't merely economic, which aligns with his view that we should have a broader ethic, not just economic considerations.

Hmm, maybe I need to recall specific quotes. He said something like "We abuse land because we regard it as a commodity belonging to us. When we see land as a community to which we belong, we may begin to use it with love and respect." So he's against treating land purely as an economic resource, which supports option C.

So the answer is likely C. Wait, but what about option B? The balance of natureâ€”Leopold did talk about the land as a system where each part plays a role. So B could also fit. But I'm not sure if he used the exact term "balance of nature" as a central theme.

I think the stronger point is C. Because Leopold was reacting against the purely economic view of land use. He wanted a more holistic approach, so C would be something he clearly accepts.

The question asks which claim Leopold would clearly accept. To determine this, it's important to analyze each option in light of Leopold's views, particularly as expressed in "A Sand County Almanac."

- **Option A** suggests that environmental problems ultimately concern how humans treat each other. While Leopold emphasized ethical treatment of the land, his focus was more on humans' relationship with the biotic community rather than solely on human interactions. Thus, this is unlikely to be his primary concern.

- **Option B** proposes thinking in terms of "the balance of nature." Leopold did discuss the land as a community and the importance of maintaining its integrity, which aligns with the idea of balance. However, the phrase "balance of nature" was not a central theme in his work, making this less definitive.

- **Option C** states that environmental problems are not merely economic issues. This aligns strongly with Leopold's critique of treating land as a commodity and his advocacy for a broader land ethic that goes beyond economic considerations. This is a key point in his philosophy.

- **Option D** suggests ignoring all economic motives in land-use decisions. While Leopold criticized purely economic approaches, he did not advocate for completely disregarding economics. Instead, he sought a balanced approach that integrated ecological and economic considerations.

Given Leopold's emphasis on moving beyond economic frameworks and adopting a more holistic ethic, **Option C** is the claim he would clearly accept.

Answer: C
