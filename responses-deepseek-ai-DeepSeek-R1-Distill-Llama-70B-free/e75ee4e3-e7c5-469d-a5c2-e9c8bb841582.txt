Question:

A husband and wife were unhappily married. The husband was an alcoholic who physically abused the wife when he became drunk. After the husband beat up the wife one night, she decided to kill him. The wife, who was experienced in firearms, planned to shoot her husband while he slept. Before carrying out her plan, the wife took out a $1,000,000 life insurance policy on her husband, naming herself as beneficiary. Shortly thereafter, the husband and wife celebrated their 10th wedding anniversary. They went out to dinner and had a truly enjoyable evening together. After a great night, the wife experienced a change of heart and decided she really loved her husband and didn't want to kill him after all. The wife confessed and told her husband about her plan, begging forgiveness. The husband was outraged. He proceeded to file for divorce and notified the police about his wife's plan. If the wife is charged with attempted murder, she should be found

Options:

A: not guilty, because she did not perform a substantial step in carrying out the murder.
B: not guilty, because her husband was physically abusive.
C: guilty, because she had previous experience with firearms.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about attempted murder. Let me think through it step by step.

The scenario is about a wife who planned to kill her abusive husband. She took out a life insurance policy, planned to shoot him while he slept, but then changed her mind before doing anything. Now she's charged with attempted murder.

I remember that attempted murder requires both intent and a substantial step towards the crime. So, the key here is whether the wife took a substantial step. Let's break it down.

She planned itâ€”so she had the intent. But planning alone isn't enough; she needs to take a concrete step towards the act. She took out a life insurance policy. Is that a substantial step? Maybe, because it shows she was preparing for the act, as it would benefit her financially after his death. But wait, is buying insurance really a step towards the murder? Or is it more of a preparatory act?

Then, she confessed to her husband and didn't go through with it. So she didn't actually commit the murder, but did she attempt it?

In some jurisdictions, a "substantial step" can include things like obtaining the means to commit the crime. So buying a gun might be a substantial step, but here she already had experience with firearms, so maybe she didn't need to buy a gun. But in this case, she took out an insurance policy. I'm not sure if that's considered a substantial step. It feels a bit indirect because it's more about the financial gain after the act, not directly taking action towards the killing.

So the main issue is whether her actions went beyond mere preparation. If she only planned and bought insurance but didn't take any direct action (like pulling the trigger or even loading the gun), then maybe she didn't take a substantial step. Some might argue that the insurance policy is a step that shows her seriousness, but others might see it as preparatory.

Looking at the options, option A says she's not guilty because she didn't perform a substantial step. Option E says guilty because she intended to kill. But intent alone isn't enough. Option F says guilty because she bought the insurance, but I'm not certain that's a substantial step.

I think the key is whether her actions crossed into attempt. If she had, for example, loaded the gun and aimed it, that would be a substantial step. But buying insurance seems more like preparation. So maybe she's not guilty because she didn't take that step yet.

Wait, but some cases might consider obtaining a means to commit the crime as a substantial step. If she didn't have a gun and bought one, that would be a step. But she was already experienced, so maybe she had the means already. So the insurance might not count as a substantial step.

So, putting it all together, she had the intent but didn't take a substantial step beyond planning and getting insurance. Therefore, she might not be guilty of attempted murder.

The question revolves around whether the wife's actions constitute attempted murder, which requires both intent and a substantial step toward the crime. The wife had the intent to kill her husband, but the critical issue is whether she took a substantial step beyond mere planning. She purchased a life insurance policy, but this act is more about financial preparation and does not directly contribute to the commission of the murder itself. Since she did not take any direct action toward killing her husband, such as loading a weapon or attempting to shoot him, her actions remain in the realm of preparation rather than an attempt. Therefore, she is not guilty of attempted murder.

Answer: A
