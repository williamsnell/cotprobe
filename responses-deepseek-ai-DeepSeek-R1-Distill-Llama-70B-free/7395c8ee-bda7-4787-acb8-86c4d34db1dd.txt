Question:

On May 2, a woman mailed the following letter to a man:"May 1I have two tickets to the concert on July 1 at the auditorium in town. I'll sell them to you for $60 per ticket, which is $10 above face value. Since the concert has been sold out for months, I think that is a good deal. You have 15 days from the above date to decide whether to accept this offer. "The man received the letter on May 4, but did not read it until May 6. On May 18, the man went to the woman's home and attempted to accept the offer. The woman replied:"Too late! I sold the tickets last week for $75 each. "Assume that the woman's letter created in the man a valid power of acceptance. Was that power terminated by lapse of time before the man went to the woman's home on May 17?

Options:

A: Yes, because the letter was mailed on May 2.
B: Yes, because the letter was dated May 1.
C: No, because the man received the letter on May 4.
D: No, because the man did not read the letter until May 6.

Okay, so I've got this contracts question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand all the details.

The situation is about a woman who mailed a letter to a man on May 2. In the letter, she offers to sell him two concert tickets for $60 each, which she notes is $10 above face value. She mentions that the concert has been sold out for months, so she thinks it's a good deal. She gives him 15 days from the date of the letter (which is May 1) to decide whether to accept the offer.

The man receives the letter on May 4 but doesn't read it until May 6. Then, on May 18, he goes to her home to accept the offer, but she tells him it's too late because she sold the tickets the previous week for $75 each.

The question is asking if the power of acceptance (the ability to accept the offer) was terminated due to the lapse of time before the man went to her home on May 17. Wait, wait, actually, the man went on May 18, but the question says May 17. Hmm, maybe that's a typo in the question, but I'll proceed with the info given.

So, the key points here are about the offer and when it expires. The woman's offer was made in a letter that was mailed on May 2, but the letter itself is dated May 1. She gave him 15 days from May 1 to accept. So, if we count 15 days from May 1, when would that be?

Let's think about how time periods work in contract law. Typically, when an offer is open for a certain number of days, it's counted from the date of the offer. So the offer was made on May 1, and she gave him 15 days from that date. So day 1 would be May 2, day 2 May 3, and so on. So 15 days from May 1 would take us to May 16. Wait, wait, noâ€”because if you include May 1 as day 0, then day 1 is May 2. So 15 days would end on May 16. So the offer would expire on May 16.

Wait, but wait another thing. The man received the letter on May 4. So does the time start when the letter was mailed (May 2), when it was received (May 4), or when he read it (May 6)? That's a crucial point because the time to accept could start from when he received it or when he knew about it.

In contract law, the general rule is that an offer is effective when it's received by the offeree. So if the offer was mailed on May 2, and received on May 4, the 15-day period would start on May 4. So 15 days from May 4 would be May 19. Wait, 15 days after May 4: May 4 is day 0, so day 1 is May 5, and adding 14 more days would take us to May 18. So the offer would expire on May 18.

Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier thought. So which is it? Does the 15-day period start when the offer is made (May 1), when it's mailed (May 2), or when it's received (May 4)?

I think the key here is that the offer was made in the letter, which was dated May 1. The woman says he has 15 days from the date above (May 1) to decide. But when does that period start running?

In contract law, the time for acceptance starts when the offer is received, unless stated otherwise. So if the offer says "15 days from the above date," which is May 1, but the man didn't receive it until May 4, does the time start on May 1 or May 4?

I recall that if the offer specifies a time from a certain date, that date is when the offer is made, so May 1. But in the case of mailed offers, the effective time is when the letter is received. But this might depend on the specific rules.

Wait, there's a concept called the "mailbox rule," which says that an offer is effective upon dispatch, and acceptance is effective upon mailing. But that's for acceptances, not for the time period of the offer. So the offer's time limit would be based on when the offer was made, unless the offer specifies otherwise.

Wait, but let me think again. The offer says he has 15 days from May 1. So regardless of when he receives it, the 15 days would run from May 1, right? So May 1 plus 15 days is May 16. So the offer would expire on May 16.

But wait, if the man didn't receive the offer until May 4, he couldn't have known about it until then. So if the offer says it's open for 15 days from May 1, but he didn't get it until May 4, then by the time he gets it, only 12 days remain. That doesn't seem fair. So perhaps the time starts when he receives it.

Alternatively, perhaps the offer is considered to have been made on May 1, so the 15 days would end on May 16. But the man received it on May 4, so he can still accept up to May 16, regardless of when he received it.

But that would mean that if the offer is made on May 1, even if the offeree receives it later, the time runs from May 1. So in this case, the offer would expire on May 16, regardless of when the man received the letter.

So the man tried to accept on May 18, which is after May 16. So the offer had already lapsed, and thus the power of acceptance was terminated.

Wait, but the options given are:

Option C: No, because the man received the letter on May 4.

Option D: No, because the man did not read the letter until May 6.

So if the time runs from when the offer was made (May 1), then the offer would expire on May 16, making the man's May 18 attempt too late. So the power was terminated by lapse of time.

But wait, some sources say that when an offer is made through mail, the time for acceptance begins when the offeree receives the offer, unless the offer specifies otherwise. So if the offer says "15 days from the date above," which is May 1, then the time starts on May 1, regardless of when it's received.

But I'm a bit confused here. Let me check the rules again.

Under the UCC and common law, when an offer is sent via mail, the time for acceptance generally begins when the offer is received, not when it's sent. But if the offer specifies a different starting point, that can override this.

In this case, the offer says "You have 15 days from the above date to decide whether to accept this offer." The "above date" is May 1, so the 15 days start on May 1. So the offer would expire on May 16 (15 days later). So when the man tried to accept on May 18, it was after the expiration, so the offer was no longer valid.

But wait, that's only if the offer's time starts on May 1. If the offer's effective date is when it's received, which is May 4, then the 15 days would end on May 19. So the man tried to accept on May 18, which would be within the time.

But the offer was explicit about the 15 days starting from May 1, so perhaps the time runs from that date. So the offer would have ended on May 16, making the man's attempt on May 18 too late.

But another angle: if the offer was mailed on May 2, received May 4, and not read until May 6, when does the 15-day period begin? If it begins when he receives it, then 15 days from May 4 is May 19. So May 18 is still within time.

Wait, but the offer says the time starts from May 1. So the offeror might have intended the 15 days to begin on May 1, regardless of when the offeree receives it.

I think the correct approach is that the time starts when the offer is received, unless the offer specifies otherwise. So the offer says "15 days from the above date (May 1)", so perhaps the time starts on May 1, regardless of when it's received.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think of a case or a rule. I remember that the time for acceptance is determined by the terms of the offer. So if the offer states that it's open for 15 days from a certain date, that's when it starts, even if the offeree receives it later.

So in this case, the time would run from May 1, ending on May 16. Therefore, the man's attempt on May 18 would be after the offer lapsed.

But another thought: the man couldn't have known about the offer until he received the letter on May 4. So is it fair that the time started before he even knew about it? That might not be the case, as the offer would not be effective until received, unless the offeror specifies that the time starts earlier.

Wait, perhaps the offer is only effective upon receipt, so the 15 days would start when he received it on May 4, making the last day May 19. So his attempt on May 18 would be on time.

But the wording in the offer says "from the above date," which is May 1. So the offeror intended the 15 days to start on May 1, regardless of when it's received.

Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Let me try to look for the rules.

In contract law, when an offer is made through a medium like mail, the offer is considered made when the offeree receives it. So the time for acceptance would start when the offeree receives it, unless the offer specifies otherwise.

So in this case, the offer was received on May 4. So the 15 days would start on May 4, ending on May 19. Therefore, the man's attempt on May 18 would be within the time, so the offer was still valid.

Wait, but the offer says "from the above date," which is May 1. So does that mean the time starts on May 1, or when the offer is received?

I think that the offer's terms specify when the time starts. So if the offer says it's open for 15 days from May 1, then the time starts on May 1. Otherwise, if it's silent, the time starts upon receipt.

But I'm not certain about this. Some sources say that the time starts when the offer is received, unless the offer specifies a different start date.

So if the offer says it's open for 15 days from May 1, then the time starts on May 1, regardless of when the offeree receives it.

In that case, the offer would expire on May 16. The man tried to accept on May 18, which is after the expiration, so the power was terminated.

But if the time starts upon receipt on May 4, then the offer would expire on May 19, and the man's attempt on May 18 would be on time.

So which is it?

I think the correct rule is that the time starts when the offer is received, unless the offer specifies a different start date. So if the offer says it's open from a certain date, that date would be the start, even if the offeree receives it later.

Therefore, the offer expires on May 16. So when the man tried to accept on May 18, it's too late.

Wait, but looking at the options, the options are:

A: Yes, because the letter was mailed on May 2.

B: Yes, because the letter was dated May 1.

C: No, because the man received the letter on May 4.

D: No, because the man did not read it until May 6.

Wait, if the offer's time starts on May 1, then the answer would be yes, the power was terminated by May 17 (since May 16 is the last day). So the man went on May 18, which is after, so the power had lapsed.

So the correct answer would be that the power was terminated, meaning the answer is either A or B.

But looking at the options, option B says yes because the letter was dated May 1. Option A says yes because it was mailed May 2.

In our analysis, the time started on May 1, so the correct reason would be because the letter was dated May 1, making option B correct.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Because the letter was mailed on May 2, but the offer was dated May 1. So the 15 days started on May 1, regardless of when it was mailed or received.

So the answer would be yes, the power terminated because the 15 days ran from May 1, making option B the correct choice.

Wait, but another thought: the offer was received on May 4, and the man didn't read it until May 6. Does that affect the time? Probably not, because the time starts when the offer is received, not when it's read. So the man's failure to read it doesn't extend the time.

So the man received it on May 4, and the 15 days would start then, ending on May 19. But wait, earlier I thought the offer's terms started the time on May 1.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to approach it differently.

The offer says: "You have 15 days from the above date to decide whether to accept this offer." The above date is May 1, so the 15 days start on May 1. So the offer expires on May 16.

The man received the offer on May 4, but the offer's time started on May 1. So from May 1, 15 days later is May 16. So when the man tried to accept on May 18, it's after the expiration.

Therefore, the power of acceptance was terminated by lapse of time. So the answer would be yes, and the reason is because the letter was dated May 1, making option B the correct answer.

But wait, let me check another angle. If the offer had said "15 days from receipt," then the time would start on May 4. But since it says "from the above date," which is May 1, the time starts then.

So the man's attempt on May 18 is too late. Therefore, the answer is yes, the power was terminated, and the reason is because the letter was dated May 1, so option B is correct.
</think>

The question revolves around whether the man's power of acceptance was terminated due to the lapse of time before he attempted to accept the offer on May 18. The woman's letter, dated May 1, offered the tickets for $60 each and stated that the man had 15 days from that date to decide. The man received the letter on May 4 but did not read it until May 6. The key issue is determining when the 15-day period began.

Under contract law, the time for acceptance typically starts when the offer is received, unless the offer specifies otherwise. In this case, the offer explicitly states that the 15-day period runs "from the above date," which is May 1. Therefore, the 15-day period began on May 1, regardless of when the man received or read the letter. Counting 15 days from May 1, the offer would expire on May 16. When the man attempted to accept on May 18, the offer had already lapsed.

The man's receipt of the letter on May 4 or his reading of it on May 6 does not alter the start date of the 15-day period, as the offer clearly tied the timeframe to May 1. Thus, the power of acceptance was terminated by lapse of time before the man's attempt to accept on May 18.

The correct answer is **B: Yes, because the letter was dated May 1**.
