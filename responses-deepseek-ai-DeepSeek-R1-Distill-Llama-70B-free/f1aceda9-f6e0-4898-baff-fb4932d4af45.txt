Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to solve two linear equations using Cramer's rule. The equations are 2x + 3y = 10 and 4x + 4y = 12. Hmm, I remember that Cramer's rule uses determinants to find the variables. Let me think about how to apply it here.

First, I think I should write the system of equations in a standard form. So, the coefficients are 2 and 3 for the first equation, and 4 and 4 for the second. The constants are 10 and 12.

Wait, I remember that for Cramer's rule, the system is written as a matrix. The coefficient matrix is [[a, b], [c, d]], and the constants are on the right side. So, our coefficient matrix (let's call it A) is:

| 2  3 |
| 4  4 |

Then, the determinant of A, det(A), is calculated as (2)(4) - (3)(4) = 8 -12 = -4. Oh, right, the determinant can't be zero because then the system wouldn't have a unique solution. Since it's -4, we're good to proceed.

Now, to find x and y, I need to replace the respective columns with the constants vector. So for x, replace the first column with [10, 12], and for y, replace the second column with [10, 12].

Let's compute the determinant for x (let's call it det(A_x)). The matrix becomes:

|10  3|
|12  4|

det(A_x) is (10)(4) - (3)(12) = 40 -36 = 4. So x is det(A_x) divided by det(A), which is 4 / (-4) = -1. Wait, that seems odd. Did I do that right?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the determinant calculation. Let's double-check. For det(A_x): 10*4 is 40, 3*12 is 36. 40-36 is 4. Yeah, that's correct. So x is 4/-4 = -1.

Hmm, moving on to y. Now, the matrix for y (det(A_y)) is:

|2 10|
|4 12|

det(A_y) is (2)(12) - (10)(4) = 24 -40 = -16. So y is det(A_y)/det(A) = (-16)/(-4) = 4. Wait, that gives y=4.

So the solution is x=-1 and y=4. Let me check the options. Option B is [-1, 4], which would be x=-1 and y=4. So the answer should be B.

Wait a second, let me double-check by plugging the values back into the original equations to make sure. 

First equation: 2*(-1) + 3*(4) = -2 +12 =10. Which matches. Second equation:4*(-1)+4*(4)= -4+16=12. That also matches. So yes, the solution is correct.

To solve the system of linear equations using Cramer's rule, we start by writing the equations in standard form:

1. \( 2x + 3y = 10 \)  
2. \( 4x + 4y = 12 \)

The coefficient matrix \( A \) is:  
\[
A = \begin{bmatrix} 
2 & 3 \\ 
4 & 4 
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The determinant of \( A \), denoted as \( \det(A) \), is calculated as:  
\[
\det(A) = (2)(4) - (3)(4) = 8 - 12 = -4
\]

Next, we compute the determinants for \( x \) and \( y \) by replacing the respective columns of \( A \) with the constants \([10, 12]\).

For \( x \), the matrix \( A_x \) is:  
\[
A_x = \begin{bmatrix} 
10 & 3 \\ 
12 & 4 
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The determinant of \( A_x \) is:  
\[
\det(A_x) = (10)(4) - (3)(12) = 40 - 36 = 4
\]

Thus, \( x = \frac{\det(A_x)}{\det(A)} = \frac{4}{-4} = -1 \).

For \( y \), the matrix \( A_y \) is:  
\[
A_y = \begin{bmatrix} 
2 & 10 \\ 
4 & 12 
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The determinant of \( A_y \) is:  
\[
\det(A_y) = (2)(12) - (10)(4) = 24 - 40 = -16
\]

Thus, \( y = \frac{\det(A_y)}{\det(A)} = \frac{-16}{-4} = 4 \).

The solution to the system is \( x = -1 \) and \( y = 4 \), which corresponds to option **B**. Verifying by substituting these values into the original equations confirms the solution is correct.

Answer: B
