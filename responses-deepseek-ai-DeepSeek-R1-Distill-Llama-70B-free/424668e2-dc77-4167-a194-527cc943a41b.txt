Okay, so I've got this economics problem here, and I need to figure out how many hours the individual will work after receiving an inheritance. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the question states that there are 8,000 hours in a year. I know that's a simplification because a real year has 8,760 hours, but I guess that's just to make the math easier. So, we'll go with 8,000 hours.

The individual has a potential market wage of $5 per hour. That means if they work, they earn $5 for each hour they put in. Now, their rich uncle left them an annual income of $4,000. So, they have this unearned income coming in every year.

The key point here is that the person devotes 75 percent of their full income to leisure. Wait, wait. I need to make sure I understand what's meant by "full income." In economics, full income usually refers to the sum of their earned income (from working) and their unearned income (like from the inheritance). So, full income is the total income they have, regardless of whether it's from work or other sources.

So, the person is allocating 75% of this full income towards leisure. Leisure, in economic terms, isn't just sitting around doing nothing; it's the time not spent working. So, the amount they spend on leisure includes the income they don't earn because they're not working. No, wait, actually, spending on leisure could be a bit different, but in this context, I think it's referring to the time allocated to leisure activities. But maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, no, wait. The question says they "devote 75 percent of full income to leisure." Hmm, that could be interpreted in two ways: either 75% of their time is leisure, or 75% of their income is spent on leisure activities. But in the context of labor-leisure choice models, typically when someone devotes a percentage to leisure, it refers to the allocation of their time. So, 75% of their time is spent on leisure, and the remaining 25% on work.

But wait, the way it's phrased is "devotes 75 percent of full income to leisure." Hmm, that's confusing because income is money, not time. So perhaps it's about allocating 75% of their income towards leisure goods or services, not necessarily time. But that doesn't directly translate to hours worked because how much you spend on leisure doesn't directly tell you how many hours you work. Unless, perhaps, there's a link through the wage.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. Oh, perhaps it's the other way around. If they have full income, which is their earnings plus unearned income, and they choose to allocate their time so that 75% of their full income is the value of their leisure time. Or maybe it's that 75% of their time is leisure.

Alternatively, perhaps this is a standard labor-leisure model where the individual chooses between work and leisure to maximize their utility. The full income (sometimes called "full wealth") would be the maximum they could earn if they worked all the time, which would be 8,000 hours * $5/hour = $40,000. But wait, in this case, the individual has an unearned income of $4,000, so their full income is actually larger.

Wait, no, maybe it's better to think of full income as the sum of their wage times all possible hours (if they worked all the time) plus any unearned income. But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try a different approach.

Let me model this using the basic labor-leisure choice. The individual's total available time is 8,000 hours. Let H be the hours they work, and L the hours they spend on leisure. So, H + L = 8,000.

Their income comes from two sources: the inheritance (unearned income) and their wages. So, their total income Y = (H * wage) + unearned income. Here, the wage is $5/hour, and the unearned income is $4,000/year.

So Y = 5H + 4000.

Now, the problem states that they devote 75% of their full income to leisure. Wait, but in the labor-leisure model, the full income (sometimes called "full wealth") is the maximum amount they could have if they worked all the time, which would be 5 * 8000 = $40,000. But in this case, they have an additional $4,000 from the inheritance, making their full income 40,000 + 4,000 = $44,000. But that doesn't seem right because the inheritance is a separate income stream. Alternatively, perhaps the full income is the sum of what they earn from working plus the unearned income.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. Let me think: if the person works H hours, they earn 5H dollars, and their total income is Y = 5H + 4000. Now, they want to allocate 75% of Y to leisure. But how does that translate into hours?

Alternatively, perhaps the allocation is in terms of time. Maybe 75% of their time is leisure, meaning they work 25% of the time.

If that's the case, then the hours worked would be 25% of 8,000, which is 2,000 hours. So, H = 0.25 * 8000 = 2000. Let me check the options. Option E is 2000. But wait, let me think again because I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, the problem says they "devote 75 percent of full income to leisure." So, perhaps it's not time but money. So, 75% of their income is spent on leisure. But how does that relate to the hours worked?

In the labor-leisure model, the individual's decision is based on the trade-off between work (which gives income) and leisure (which gives utility). The budget constraint is that the income from work plus unearned income allows them to purchase goods and leisure. But in terms of time allocation, the more hours you work, the more goods you can buy, but the less time you have for leisure.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the concepts. Let me try again.

The individual's total income is Y = 5H + 4000.

They choose H and L such that H + L = 8000.

But the question says they "devote 75% of full income to leisure." I think I'm misunderstanding what "full income" refers to. Maybe full income is their potential earnings without any unearned income. So, full income would be 5 * 8000 = 40,000. So, if they allocate 75% of this to leisure, that would be 0.75 * 40,000 = 30,000. But their actual income is 5H + 4000. So, perhaps the amount they spend on leisure is 30,000, but their actual income is less than 40,000 because they don't work all the hours.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let's try another approach. Maybe the question is saying that 75% of their time is leisure. So, L = 0.75 * 8000 = 6000 hours. Then, H = 8000 - 6000 = 2000 hours. So, option E is 2000. But wait, the presence of unearned income might affect their labor supply.

Alternatively, perhaps the inheritance makes them wealthier, so they choose to work fewer hours. Because with more unearned income, their opportunity cost of leisure decreases, so they might choose more leisure and work less.

But the problem states that they are devoting 75% of their full income to leisure. So, perhaps it's about how they allocate their income between consumption and leisure. But I'm not entirely clear.

Wait, perhaps the full income is Y = 5H + 4000, and they spend 75% of Y on leisure. The value of leisure is the wage times the hours of leisure. So, the value of leisure is 5L. Because if you're not working, the opportunity cost is the wage you could have earned.

So, if they spend 75% of Y on leisure, then 0.75Y = 5L.

And since H + L = 8000, we can write L = 8000 - H.

Substituting into the equation:

0.75Y = 5(8000 - H)

But Y = 5H + 4000, so substitute Y:

0.75(5H + 4000) = 5*(8000 - H)

Let me compute that:

Left side: 0.75*(5H + 4000) = (3.75 H) + 3000

Right side: 5*(8000 - H) = 40000 - 5H

Now, set them equal:

3.75H + 3000 = 40000 -5H

Bring all terms to one side:

3.75H + 5H + 3000 -40000 = 0

8.75H - 37000 = 0

8.75H = 37000

H = 37000 / 8.75

Let me compute that:

First, let's compute 8.75 * 4000 = 35,000 (since 8*4000=32000, 0.75*4000=3000 → 35000). So 8.75 * 4228.57 ≈ 37000.

Wait, 8.75 * 4228.571 ≈ 37000.

Wait, let me compute 37000 ÷ 8.75.

8.75 is equal to 35/4, so dividing by 35/4 is the same as multiplying by 4/35.

So, 37000 * (4/35) = ?

Wait, 35 goes into 37000 1000 times because 35 * 1000 = 35,000. Then, 37000 - 35000 = 2000.

35 * 57 = 1995. So, 57 *35=1995 → 2000-1995=5 left.

So, 35*(1000 +57) = 35*1057=35*(1000+57)=35,000 + 1995=36,995.

Wait, but we're at 37,000. So, we have 37,000 - 36,995 = 5 left. So, 35 goes into 5 1/7 times.

So, 4/35 *37,000 = 4*(1057 + 1/7) = 4*1057 + 4*(1/7) = 4228 + 0.571 ≈ 4228.571 hours.

Wait, but that's way more than the total hours available (8,000). So, that can't be right. I must have made a mistake in setting up the equation.

Hmm, perhaps I misunderstood what "devote 75% of full income to leisure" means. Maybe it's the time allocation, not the income allocation. So, if they spend 75% of their time on leisure, then they work 25% of the time.

So, H = 0.25 *8000 = 2000 hours, which is option E.

But earlier, when I tried the income approach, I ended up with H=4228 hours, which is impossible because total hours are 8000. So, I must have set up that equation incorrectly.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that 75% of their income goes to leisure, but that's not the same as 75% of their time. Wait, but how would that work? Because the value of leisure is the wage times the hours not worked. So, if they're spending 75% of their income on leisure, that 75% of Y equals the value of their leisure time, which is 5*(8000 - H).

So, 0.75Y = 5*(8000 - H)

But Y is their total income, which is 5H + 4000.

So substituting:

0.75*(5H +4000) =5*(8000 - H)

Let me calculate:

Left: 0.75*(5H +4000) = 3.75 H + 3000

Right: 5*(8000 - H) = 40000 -5H

Set equal:

3.75 H +3000 =40000 -5H

Bring variables to left and constants to right:

3.75H +5H =40000 -3000

8.75H =37000

H=37000 /8.75

H=4228.571 hours.

But that's impossible because total hours are 8000. So, I must have done something wrong in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the way I defined Y is incorrect. Let me think again: Y is their total income, which is from work (5H) and the inheritance (4000). So Y=5H+4000.

If they spend 75% of Y on leisure, that would mean that 0.75Y is the amount they spend on leisure. But what exactly does spending on leisure mean in terms of hours? Because leisure is time, not a good you can buy. Unless we're assuming that the value of leisure is the opportunity cost, which is the wage they could have earned.

So, the value of leisure is 5*(8000 - H), because for each hour not worked, they lose $5 in potential earnings.

So, 0.75Y = value of leisure → 0.75*(5H+4000) =5*(8000 - H)

Which is the same equation as before, leading to H=4228.57, which is impossible.

This suggests that perhaps the assumption is wrong. Maybe the 75% is not of their Y but of their potential earnings without the inheritance.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is intended to mean that 75% of their time is leisure. So, L=0.75*8000=6000 → H=2000. So, the answer would be E:2000.

But given that the equation approach leads to an impossible number, maybe the correct interpretation is the time allocation. So, the answer is E:2000.

To determine how many hours the individual will work, we analyze the problem as follows:

1. **Key Information**:  
   - Total hours in a year: 8,000 (simplified).  
   - Market wage: $5 per hour.  
   - Annual inheritance: $4,000.  
   - The individual devotes 75% of their full income to leisure.  

2. **Interpretation of "Full Income"**:  
   Full income typically refers to the sum of earned income (from working) and unearned income (from the inheritance). Thus, total income is:  
   \[
   Y = 5H + 4000
   \]  
   where \( H \) is the hours worked.  

3. **Devoting 75% of Full Income to Leisure**:  
   The problem states that 75% of full income is devoted to leisure. Leisure, in this context, is interpreted as the value of time not spent working. The value of leisure is the opportunity cost of not working, which is the wage rate (\$5/hour) multiplied by the hours of leisure (\( L \)).  

   The relationship between work and leisure is:  
   \[
   H + L = 8000
   \]  
   where \( L \) is the hours of leisure.  

4. **Setting Up the Equation**:  
   If 75% of full income is devoted to leisure, then:  
   \[
   0.75Y = 5L
   \]  
   Substituting \( Y = 5H + 4000 \) and \( L = 8000 - H \):  
   \[
   0.75(5H + 4000) = 5(8000 - H)
   \]  

5. **Solving for \( H \)**:  
   Expand and simplify:  
   \[
   3.75H + 3000 = 40000 - 5H
   \]  
   Combine like terms:  
   \[
   8.75H = 37000
   \]  
   Solve for \( H \):  
   \[
   H = \frac{37000}{8.75} = 4228.57
   \]  

6. **Impossibility of the Result**:  
   The calculated \( H = 4228.57 \) exceeds the total available hours (8000), which is not possible. This suggests that interpreting "75% of full income to leisure" as a monetary allocation leads to an inconsistency.  

7. **Alternative Interpretation**:  
   If "75% of full income to leisure" is interpreted as allocating 75% of total time to leisure, then:  
   \[
   L = 0.75 \times 8000 = 6000
   \]  
   Since \( H + L = 8000 \), the hours worked would be:  
   \[
   H = 8000 - 6000 = 2000
   \]  

8. **Conclusion**:  
   The most reasonable interpretation is that 75% of the individual's time is devoted to leisure, leading to \( H = 2000 \) hours worked.
