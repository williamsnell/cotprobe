Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the diameter of a steel bar. Let's see what the question says. The bar needs to resist the impact of a 550 lb weight dropped through 4 inches. The bar is 14 inches long, and the design stress is 22,000 psi. Hmm, I remember that when a weight is dropped, it's an impact load problem, so energy methods might be involved here.

Wait, impact loads are related to strain energy, right? The energy absorbed by the bar when it's deformed. The formula I think is U = (W * h), where W is the weight and h is the height of the drop. Then, this energy should equal the strain energy stored in the bar.

Strain energy U for a bar under axial load is given by U = (S^2 * V) / (2E), where S is the stress, V is the volume, and E is the modulus of elasticity. But wait, that's the formula for elastic strain energy. Oh right, because the bar is steel, which is elastic under normal conditions.

So, setting the two energies equal: W * h = (S² * V) / (2E). I think that's the starting point. Now, I need to solve for the diameter of the bar, which relates to the cross-sectional area.

Wait, the volume V of the bar is the area A multiplied by the length L. So V = A * L. And since the bar is a circle, the area A is πd²/4, where d is the diameter.

Putting it all together: W*h = (S² * (A * L)) / (2E). Substituting A, it becomes W*h = (S² * (πd²/4 * L)) / (2E).

I can rearrange this to solve for d. Let's see:

d² = (8 W h E) / (S² π L)

Wait, let me check the rearrangement. Let's go step by step.

Starting from:

W h = (S² * (π d² L /4 )) / (2 E)

Simplify the denominator 2E: so numerator is S² * π d² L /4.

So, W h = (S² * π d² L) / (8 E)

So rearranged:

d² = (8 W h E) / (S² π L)

Then take the square root to get d.

Wait, but I need to make sure about the units. Because in the formula, W should be in force units, but wait, in the energy equation W h is in foot-pounds or similar. Let me think about the units.

Wait, the weight W is 550 lb, but in the formula, W is the force, which is weight (mass * g). So that's okay as long as h is in inches or converted to feet.

Wait, but in the formula, if W is in pounds (force), then h should be in feet because 1 lb·ft is a unit of energy. Hmm, but in the problem, h is 4 inches, which is 4/12 = 1/3 foot.

Wait, so W h would be in lb-ft. Let me make sure the units are consistent.

Alternatively, maybe using the metric system would be easier, but I think the standard approach is to convert everything to inches and pounds, or feet and slugs, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use the units as given, making sure that E is in psi (which is lb per square inch), so we can keep everything in inches and pounds.

Wait, modulus of elasticity E for steel is typically around 29,000,000 psi. I remember that number. So E = 29e6 psi.

So putting all these together, let's plug in the numbers.

Given:
W = 550 lb
h = 4 inches = 4/12 = 1/3 foot
But wait, in the formula, if using W in lb, h should be in feet? Or do I need to adjust units elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps I can treat everything in inches and pounds, but then area would be in square inches, which is fine because stress is in psi.

Wait, perhaps I should express h in inches. Let me think again.

In the formula, the energy from the weight is W (force in pounds) multiplied by the distance h (in inches). But in the system of units, 1 inch-pound is a unit of energy, but I'm not sure about the consistency with the other terms. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to convert h to feet.

So, h = 4 inches = 4/12 = 1/3 ft.

So let's compute W h in lb-ft:

550 lb * (1/3 ft) ≈ 183.333 lb-ft.

Now, the energy U is also equal to (S² * V) / (2E). So, U = W h.

So,

183.333 = (S² * V) / (2E)

We need to solve for V. V is the volume of the bar, which is A * L. A is π d²/4, and L is 14 inches. Wait, but in the formula, if L is in inches, and E is in psi (lb/in²), then the units should be consistent.

Wait, perhaps I should convert L to inches. Let me see:

Wait, in the formula, V would be in cubic inches, because A is in square inches and L is in inches.

So, let's recompute W h in inch-pounds instead of foot-pounds, perhaps that's better.

Because 1 ft = 12 inches, so 1 lb-ft = 12 lb-in. So, W h in lb-in would be 550 lb * 4 in = 2200 lb-in.

Wait, but that's different. So which approach is correct? I think I need to make sure that all units are consistent.

Let me clarify the units:

The energy from the weight is W (force) multiplied by the distance h. So, W is 550 lb, h is 4 inches. So, the energy is 550 lb * 4 in = 2200 lb-in.

But in the strain energy equation, U is (S² * V) / (2E). The units of U should be in energy units, which in this case, S is psi (lb/in²), V is in³, E is psi (lb/in²).

So, let's check the units:

(S² * V) / (2E) has units of (lb²/in⁴) * in³ / (lb/in²) ) = (lb² * in³) / (in⁴ * lb/in²) ) = (lb² * in³ * in²) / (in⁴ * lb) )= (lb² * in5) / (in^4 lb) )= (lb * in).

Which is lb-in, matching the energy from the weight.

So, yes, using W h in lb-in is correct.

So, U = 2200 lb-in.

Thus, 2200 = (S² * V) / (2E )

We can solve for V.

V = (2200 * 2E ) / (S² )

Now, E for steel is 29e6 psi, S is 22,000 psi.

Plugging the numbers:

V = (2200 * 2 * 29e6 ) / (22000^2 )

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute numerator: 2200 * 2 * 29e6 = 2200 * 58e6 = Let's see, 2200 * 58e6.

Wait, 2200 is 2.2e3. 58e6 is 5.8e7.

So, 2.2e3 * 5.8e7 = (2.2 *5.8) * 1e10.

2.2 *5.8 = 12.76. So, 12.76e10 = 1.276e11.

Denominator: (22,000)^2 = (2.2e4)^2 = 4.84e8.

So V = 1.276e11 / 4.84e8 ≈ Approximately 263.5 in³.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately:

1.276e11 / 4.84e8 = (1.276 / 4.84) * 1e3.

1.276 ÷ 4.84 → 4.84 × 0.263 ≈ 1.276, so 0.263.

So, V ≈ 0.263 * 1e3 = 263 in³.

But wait, V is the volume of the bar, which is A * L. A is π d²/4, L is 14 inches.

So, V = (π d²/4) * 14 = (14 π d² ) /4 = (7 π d² ) / 2.

So, 7 π d² / 2 = 263 → d² = (263 * 2) / (7 π) → 526 / (7 * 3.1416) ≈ 526 / 21.991 ≈ 23.93.

So, d² ≈23.93 → d ≈√23.93 ≈4.89 inches.

Hmm, approximately 4.89 inches. Looking at the options:

Options are A:4, B:4.5, C:2.5, D:5, E:7, F:6, G:3.5, H:3, I:6.5, J:5.5.

So, closest to 4.89 is 5 inches (option D). But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Let me double-check the calculations.

Compute V = (2200 * 2 * 29e6) / (22000^2 )

2200 * 2 = 4400, 4400 *29e6 = 4400 * 29,000,000 = 127,600,000,000.

Wait, 4,400 *29,000,000 = 127,600,000,000.

Denominator: (22,000)^2 = 484,000,000.

So V = 127.6e9 / 484e6 = let's compute that.

127.6e9 = 1.276e11, 484e6 = 4.84e8.

1.276e11 / 4.84e8 = (1.276 /4.84 ) * 1e3 = approx 0.263 *1e3 = 263 in³.

That seems correct.

Then, V = 263 = (π d² *14 ) /4 → because A = π d²/4, so V= A *14= (π d^2/4)*14 = (14 π d^2)/4 = (7 π d² )/2.

So,

7 π d² / 2 = 263 → d² = (263 * 2 ) / (7 π ) → 526 / (21.9911) ≈23.93 → d≈4.89 inches.

So approximately 4.89 inches, so the closest option is D:5 inches.

Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I missed a factor in the formula. The formula I used was U = W h = (S² V) / (2 E). Is that correct?

Wait, another thought: when a weight drops, it's a suddenly applied load. The formula I remember is that the energy stored in the bar is W h, which equals the strain energy.

But another approach is to equate elastic strain energy to the potential energy lost by the weight. So that part is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for impact where stress S = (W/A) * (1 + sqrt(1 + (2 E h)/(W L)) ). But that formula is for when the bar is struck at the end and the weight drops, causing an extension. Wait, but in that case, the stress is higher.

Wait, perhaps I confused the formula. Another method for impact is using the formula S = (W/L) * sqrt( (2 E h ) / (W) ) ). No, I'm getting a bit confused. Wait, perhaps the energy approach is the correct one.

Wait, another approach. The potential energy lost by the weight is m g h, which equals the strain energy in the bar.

But in the English system, weight W = m g. So m g h = W h.

So U = W h, which is correct. So the initial approach was correct.

So, I think my calculation is correct, leading to d≈4.89 inches, which is closest to 5 inches, option D.

Wait, but another thought: Did I use the correct modulus of elasticity? I used E=29e6 psi, which is typical for steel. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the design stress is 22,000 psi, which is higher than the usual, but that's given.

Alternatively, let me recompute the V calculation numerically.

V = (W h * 2 E ) / (S² )

W=550 lb, h=4 in, E=29e6, S=22,000.

So,

V = (550 *4 *2 *29e6) / (22,000^2 )

Calculate numerator: 550 *4 = 2200; 2200 *2 =4400; 4400 *29e6 = 4400 *29,000,000 = 127,600,000,000.

Denominator: (22,000)^2 = 484,000,000.

So V = 127,600,000,000 / 484,000,000 = 127.6e9 / 0.484e9 → 127.6 / 0.484 ≈ 263.5 in³.

Yes, same as before.

So, V=263.5 in³.

Then, V= (π d² /4 ) *14 → 14 * π d² /4 = (7 π d² )/2.

So,

7 π d² /2 =263.5 → d² = (263.5 *2 ) / (7 π ) → 527 / (21.991) ≈23.97 → d=√23.97≈4.897 in.

So approximately 4.9 inches. The options are D:5, which is the closest. So the answer should be D:5 in.

To calculate the diameter of a steel bar that resists the impact of a 550 lb weight dropped through 4 inches, we use the energy method. The energy absorbed by the bar is equal to the strain energy stored in it. The strain energy is given by:

\[
U = \frac{S^2 V}{2E}
\]

where:
- \( S \) is the design stress (22,000 psi),
- \( V \) is the volume of the bar,
- \( E \) is the modulus of elasticity of steel (29,000,000 psi).

The energy absorbed by the bar is also equal to the potential energy lost by the weight:

\[
U = W \cdot h
\]

where:
- \( W \) is the weight (550 lb),
- \( h \) is the height of the drop (4 inches).

Equating the two expressions for energy:

\[
W \cdot h = \frac{S^2 V}{2E}
\]

Rearranging for \( V \):

\[
V = \frac{2 W h E}{S^2}
\]

Substituting the given values:
- \( W = 550 \, \text{lb} \),
- \( h = 4 \, \text{in} \),
- \( E = 29,000,000 \, \text{psi} \),
- \( S = 22,000 \, \text{psi} \),

\[
V = \frac{2 \cdot 550 \cdot 4 \cdot 29,000,000}{22,000^2}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
2 \cdot 550 \cdot 4 \cdot 29,000,000 = 1.276 \times 10^{11}
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:

\[
22,000^2 = 4.84 \times 10^8
\]

Thus:

\[
V = \frac{1.276 \times 10^{11}}{4.84 \times 10^8} \approx 263.5 \, \text{in}^3
\]

The volume of the bar is related to its cross-sectional area \( A \) and length \( L \) by:

\[
V = A \cdot L
\]

For a circular bar, the cross-sectional area is:

\[
A = \frac{\pi d^2}{4}
\]

Substituting \( V = 263.5 \, \text{in}^3 \) and \( L = 14 \, \text{in} \):

\[
263.5 = \frac{\pi d^2}{4} \cdot 14
\]

Simplify:

\[
263.5 = \frac{7 \pi d^2}{2}
\]

Rearranging for \( d^2 \):

\[
d^2 = \frac{263.5 \cdot 2}{7 \pi}
\]

\[
d^2 = \frac{527}{21.991} \approx 23.97
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
d \approx \sqrt{23.97} \approx 4.89 \, \text{in}
\]

The closest option to 4.89 inches is **5 inches**.
