Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about jurisprudence schools, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me start by breaking down the question. The question is asking which school of jurisprudence believes that the law is an aggregate of social traditions and customs that have developed over centuries. 

Hmm, I remember that there are several schools, like Natural Law, Positivist, Historical, Sociological, etc. Each has a different view on what law is. Let me think about each option.

The question mentions that law is based on social traditions and customs over time. So I'm thinking which school focuses on how law develops from the past, like historical influences.

I think the Historical School might be the one. Because, as the name suggests, historical would relate to history and development over time. I remember that the Historical School, associated with people like Friedrich Carl von Savigny, emphasizes that law is rooted in the history and culture of a society. They see law as evolving gradually through customs and traditions rather than being created by a legislature.

Wait, but what about the Sociological School? I think that's more about how law interacts with society currently, looking at social structures and functions. So Sociological might be about the present social aspects, not so much the historical development.

Natural Law is about higher, universal principles, right? Like moral and ethical laws. So that's probably not it.

Positivist School, I think, is about law as it's posited, meaning law is what's written and enforced by authorities. So it's more about the current rules, not the historical evolution.

Analytical jurisprudence is more about the analysis of legal concepts, like definitions and structure, so that doesn't fit.

Interpretive might be about how law is interpreted, but I'm not too sure about that.

Realist is more about how law is applied in practice by judges and the effects on society.

So putting it together, the Historical School fits because it's about law being a collection of traditions and customs developed over time.

The correct answer is the Historical School of jurisprudence, which views law as an aggregate of social traditions and customs that have evolved over centuries. This school emphasizes the gradual development of law through history and culture, rather than focusing on current social structures or legislative enactments.
