Okay, so I've got this physics problem about organ pipes and sound waves. Hmm, I need to find the length of an open pipe based on the given information. Let me try to break this down step by step.

The problem says that the fundamental frequency of a stopped organ pipe is 220 Hz. Wait, a stopped organ pipe is a closed pipe, right? So for a closed pipe, the fundamental frequency is given by f1 = v/(4L), where v is the speed of sound, and L is the length of the pipe. Wait no, wait. Let me think again. No, wait, for a closed pipe, the first harmonic is the fundamental, and the third harmonic is the next, which is the second overtone. Oh wait, overtones are the harmonics above the fundamental. So for a closed pipe, the harmonics are the odd multiples of the fundamental. So first harmonic is f1, third is 3f1 (the first overtone), fifth is 5f1 (second overtone), etc.

Wait, the question says that the second overtone of the stopped pipe has the same wavelength as the third harmonic of an open pipe. Hmm. Let me get this straight. For the stopped (closed) pipe, the second overtone is the third harmonic, because the first overtone is the second harmonic, and the second overtone is the fourth? Wait, no. Wait, I get confused. Let me clarify. In a closed pipe:

Fundamental is f1 = v/(4L). Then the next possible frequency is 3f1, which is the first overtone (second harmonic), and then 5f1, which is the second overtone (third harmonic?), no wait. Oh wait, no. The first harmonic is the fundamental (f1), the second harmonic is 2f1, but in a closed pipe, 2f1 isn't possible because it's a node at the closed end requires an odd multiple of quarter wavelengths. So the possible harmonics are 1,3,5,... So for closed pipe, the harmonics are f1, 3f1, 5f1, etc. So the nth harmonic is (2n-1)f1. So the first overtone (which is the second harmonic) is 3f1, second overtone is 5f1 (third harmonic). So in this problem, the second overtone of the closed pipe is 5f1.

Wait, the problem says the second overtone of the stopped pipe. So for the stopped pipe, which is a closed pipe, the second overtone is the fifth harmonic? Because first overtone is 3f1 (second harmonic), second overtone would be 5f1 (third harmonic). Wait, no. Wait, the overtone numbering starts at the first overtone. So the fundamental is f1 (first harmonic), first overtone is 3f1 (second harmonic), second overtone is 5f1 (third harmonic). So yes, the second overtone is 5f1.

So the frequency of the second overtone of the closed pipe is 5f1. Since f1 is given as 220 Hz, the second overtone is 5 * 220 = 1100 Hz.

The problem states that this second overtone has the same wavelength as the third harmonic of an open pipe. So the wavelength of 1100 Hz (from closed pipe's second overtone) is equal to the wavelength of the third harmonic of the open pipe.

Wait, but the wavelength depends on the frequency and the speed of sound. Wait, but if the frequencies are different, but the wavelength is the same, that would mean that the speed of sound must be the same, which is given as such implicitly. Because the speed of sound is the same for both, as it's the same day, same medium.

So for the open pipe, the third harmonic is the frequency. Let me think about open pipes. For open pipes, all harmonics are possible because both ends are open. The fundamental is f1 = v/(2L), and the nth harmonic is n*f1. So the third harmonic is 3*f1_open, where f1_open is the fundamental frequency of the open pipe.

But wait, the problem says the third harmonic of the open pipe. So the frequency of the third harmonic of the open pipe is 3*f1_open.

Now, the wavelength of the second overtone (1100 Hz) from the closed pipe is equal to the wavelength of the third harmonic of the open pipe. So, the wavelength (lambda) is v/f. So for the closed pipe's overtone, lambda1 = v / 1100 Hz. For the open pipe's third harmonic, lambda2 = v / (3*f1_open).

Since the wavelengths are equal, lambda1 = lambda2. So:

v/1100 = v/(3*f1_open)

The v's cancel out, so 1/1100 = 1/(3 f1_open) => 3 f1_open = 1100 => f1_open = 1100 /3 ≈ 366.666... Hz.

Now, for the open pipe, f1_open = v/(2 L). Wait, but what is v? Oh wait, the speed of sound is given as the fundamental frequency of the stopped pipe. Wait, the question says "the speed of sound is the fundamental frequency of a particular stopped organ pipe is 220 Hz." Oh, I think I misread that earlier. So the speed of sound (v) is equal to the fundamental frequency (f1_closed) of the closed pipe. Because for a stopped pipe, f1 = v/(4 L_closed). But in this case, the problem says that v equals f1_closed (which is 220 Hz). Wait no, let me read that again.

The problem states: "On a day when the speed of sound is the fundamental frequency of a particular stopped organ pipe is 220 Hz." Hmm, the wording is a bit confusing. Oh, perhaps it's better phrased as "the speed of sound is such that the fundamental frequency of a particular stopped organ pipe is 220 Hz." So v is the speed of sound, and for a stopped pipe, f1_closed = v/(4 L_closed) = 220 Hz.

Wait, but I don't think we need the length of the closed pipe. Because the problem is asking about the open pipe. So perhaps the information about the closed pipe's fundamental is to find the speed of sound.

Wait, let me clarify. The problem says the speed of sound on that day makes the fundamental frequency of a stopped pipe 220 Hz. So for a stopped pipe, f1 = v/(4 L). But without knowing L, can we find v? Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, perhaps the speed of sound is equal to the fundamental frequency times 4 times the length? But without knowing L, maybe it's given differently.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the problem states that the speed of sound equals the fundamental frequency of the stopped pipe. That is, v = 220 Hz? That can't be right because the speed of sound is about 343 m/s, not 220 Hz. Oh, wait, no, maybe the problem says that the fundamental frequency of the stopped pipe is 220 Hz, which is caused by the speed of sound. So perhaps the speed of sound v is standard, but that's unclear. Wait, perhaps I need to re-examine the problem statement.

Wait, the problem says: "On a day when the speed of sound is the fundamental frequency of a particular stopped organ pipe is 220 Hz." Hmm, maybe it's a translation issue. Perhaps it's intended to mean that the speed of sound is such that the fundamental frequency of a certain stopped pipe is 220 Hz. So perhaps the stopped pipe's L is such that f1 = v/(4L) = 220 Hz.

But I don't think we need the length of the stopped pipe, because the problem is about the open pipe. So maybe we can find v from the stopped pipe's f1. Because for a stopped pipe, f1 = v/(4 L_closed) = 220 Hz. But without knowing L_closed, we can't find v unless more info is given. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the speed of sound is given as 220 Hz multiplied by some factor. Oh wait, no. Wait, perhaps the problem is implying that the speed of sound is the same as the fundamental frequency of the stopped pipe, which would be v = 220 Hz. That doesn't make sense because the units don't match. Hz is 1/s, and m/s is the unit for speed of sound. So that can't be. So perhaps the correct approach is to find v using the stopped pipe's fundamental.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed by assigning variables. Let me denote:

For the closed (stopped) pipe:

f1_closed = 220 Hz.

The formula is f1_closed = v/(4 L_closed), so v = 4 L_closed * 220.

But without knowing L_closed, I can't find v. Hmm. Wait, but perhaps the problem is structured so that v cancels out later. Let's see.

The second overtone of the closed pipe is 5*f1_closed = 5*220 = 1100 Hz.

The wavelength of this is lambda = v / 1100.

This lambda is equal to the wavelength of the third harmonic of the open pipe.

The third harmonic of the open pipe is 3*f1_open.

So for the open pipe, lambda_open = v / (3 f1_open) = v / (3 f1_open).

Setting this equal to lambda_closed_second_overtone:

v/1100 = v/(3 f1_open)

Cancel v from both sides:

1/1100 = 1/(3 f1_open) => 3 f1_open = 1100 => f1_open = 1100/3 ≈ 366.6667 Hz.

Now, for the open pipe, the fundamental frequency is f1_open = v/(2 L_open).

So we can write:

f1_open = v/(2 L_open) => L_open = v/(2 f1_open).

We have f1_open as ~366.6667 Hz, but we need v. Wait, but from the closed pipe, v = 4 L_closed * 220. But again, without knowing L_closed, how can we find v? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. The problem states that "the speed of sound is the fundamental frequency of a particular stopped organ pipe is 220 Hz." Wait, maybe the wording is that the speed of sound is such that the fundamental frequency is 220 Hz, which would mean that v = 4 L_closed * 220. But without knowing L_closed, I can't find v.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the problem assumes that the speed of sound is 220 Hz multiplied by 4 times L_closed, but perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should express v in terms of the closed pipe's parameters. So v = 4 L_closed * 220.

Then, for the open pipe:

f1_open = 1100/3 Hz.

But f1_open = v/(2 L_open) => L_open = v/(2 f1_open).

Substituting v:

L_open = (4 L_closed * 220) / (2 * (1100/3)).

Simplify:

= (4 * 220 * L_closed) / (2 * (1100/3)).

Simplify numerator: 4 * 220 = 880.

Denominator: 2 * (1100/3) = (2200/3).

So L_open = (880 L_closed) / (2200/3) ) = (880 * 3 L_closed) / 2200.

Simplify 880 /2200 = 2/5.

So: (2/5) *3 = 6/5.

So L_open = (6/5) L_closed.

Wait, that's strange because L_open is expressed in terms of L_closed, which we don't know. Hmm.

But this seems to lead me into a loop. Maybe I'm missing a key point here. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the speed of sound is given as 220 Hz times some factor. But that's not possible because 220 Hz is a frequency, not a speed.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem's first statement. Let me read it again.

"On a day when the speed of sound is the fundamental frequency of a particular stopped organ pipe is 220 Hz."

Hmm, perhaps it's a typo and should say that the fundamental frequency of the stopped pipe is 220 Hz. So v is the speed of sound, which is a given value, but perhaps in this problem, v is not given, but the f1_closed is given as 220 Hz.

Wait, but without knowing v, I can't compute the open pipe's length because L_open = v/(2 f1_open). But I have f1_open as 1100/3 Hz, so L_open = v/(2*(1100/3)) )= (3 v)/(2*1100) = (3v)/(2200).

But I don't know v yet. So perhaps I can find v from the closed pipe.

From the closed pipe: f1_closed = v/(4 L_closed) = 220.

So v = 4 L_closed * 220.

But I don't know L_closed. Hmm. So this approach leads me to a dead end.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the stopped pipe's length is such that when f1 is 220 Hz, the speed of sound is v. But without knowing L_closed, I can't find v. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, maybe the problem is saying that the speed of sound is equal to 220 Hz. But that's not possible because speed is measured in m/s, and Hz is 1/s. So that can't be right. So perhaps the problem statement is intended to mean that the fundamental frequency of the stopped pipe is 220 Hz, and the speed of sound is v.

So I think I need to proceed under the assumption that v is a known value, perhaps taken from standard conditions, but since it's not given, perhaps it's a variable that cancels out.

Wait, let me try that approach. Let's go back to the equations.

For the closed pipe, the second overtone is 5*f1_closed = 5 *220 = 1100 Hz.

The wavelength of this is lambda = v / 1100.

For the open pipe, the third harmonic is 3*f1_open. The wavelength is lambda = v/(3 f1_open).

Set equal: v/1100 = v/(3 f1_open) → 3 f1_open = 1100 → f1_open = 1100/3 ≈ 366.6667 Hz.

Now, for the open pipe, f1_open = v/(2 L_open).

Therefore, L_open = v/(2 f1_open) = v/(2*(1100/3)) )= (3 v)/(2 * 1100 )= (3v)/(2200).

But I still don't know v. Hmm.

Wait, but from the closed pipe, f1_closed = v/(4 L_closed) → v =4 L_closed *220.

So substituting into L_open:

L_open = (3 * (4 L_closed *220)) / 2200.

Simplify numerator: 3*4*220 * L_closed = 12*220 L_closed = 2640 L_closed.

Denominator: 2200.

So L_open = (2640 L_closed) / 2200 = (264 / 220) L_closed.

Simplify 264/220: both divided by 4 → 66/55 → 1.2. So L_open = 1.2 L_closed.

But again, without knowing L_closed, I can't find L_open. So perhaps I'm missing a key piece of information or making a wrong assumption.

Wait, perhaps the problem is structured so that v can be eliminated. Let me think.

Wait, from the closed pipe, v =4 L_closed *220.

From the open pipe, L_open = (3v)/(2200).

Substituting v:

L_open = 3*(4 L_closed *220) / 2200 = (12 L_closed *220) / 2200.

Simplify numerator: 12*220=2640.

Denominator: 2200.

So L_open = 2640 L_closed / 2200 = (264/220) L_closed.

Again, 264 divided by 220 is 1.2. So L_open =1.2 L_closed.

But without knowing L_closed, I can't proceed. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe I should consider that the problem expects me to find the ratio and make an assumption about the length of the closed pipe.

Wait, or perhaps the speed of sound is given as 220 Hz, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps the problem intended to say that the fundamental frequency of the closed pipe is 220 Hz, and the speed of sound is the usual 343 m/s, but that's not stated.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's the speed of sound that's linked to the fundamental frequency of the stopped pipe. So perhaps the problem is saying that v = 220 Hz. But that's impossible because Hz is not a unit of speed.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem says that the speed of sound is such that for a stopped pipe, its fundamental is 220 Hz, and from that, we can find v.

So, f1_closed = v/(4 L_closed) =220.

But without knowing L_closed, I can't find v. So perhaps L_closed is given elsewhere, but it's not in the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the stopped pipe's length is such that L_closed = v/(4*220), but without knowing v, that's not helpful.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me try to approach this differently.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to find the length of the open pipe without needing to know the speed of sound, perhaps because the v cancels out.

Wait, let me try that.

So, from the closed pipe:

Second overtone (5f1_closed) =1100 Hz.

Wavelength lambda_closed = v /1100.

From the open pipe:

Third harmonic =3f1_open.

Lambda_open = v/(3 f1_open).

Set equal: v/1100 = v/(3 f1_open) → 3 f1_open =1100 → f1_open= 1100/3 ≈ 366.6667 Hz.

For the open pipe, f1_open = v/(2 L_open) → L_open= v/(2 f1_open) = v/(2*(1100/3))= (3v)/(2200).

But I still need to find v in terms of known quantities.

From the closed pipe, f1_closed =220 Hz = v/(4 L_closed) → v= 4 L_closed *220.

Substituting into L_open:

L_open= (3 *4 L_closed *220 )/(2200 )= (12 L_closed *220 )/(2200).

Simplify 220/2200
