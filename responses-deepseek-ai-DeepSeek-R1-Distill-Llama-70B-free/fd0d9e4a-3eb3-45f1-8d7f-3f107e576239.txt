Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's read it again. The question is about the solid angle subtended by an area on the surface of a sphere. Hmm, solid angle, right. I remember that solid angle is a bit different from the regular angles we usually think about. It's measured in steradians, I think.

The problem says the area is 2400 cm², and the sphere has a diameter of 1.2 meters. Wait, I need to make sure the units are consistent. Oh yeah, centimeters and meters. Let me convert everything to the same unit. So 2400 cm² is 2400 * (1e-2 m)^2, since 1 cm is 0.01 meters. Let's calculate that. 0.01 squared is 0.0001, so 2400 * 0.0001 = 0.24 m². So the area A is 0.24 m².

The sphere's diameter is 1.2 meters, so the radius r is half of that, which is 0.6 meters. Got it. Now, solid angle Ω is related to the area and the radius. I think the formula is Ω = A / r². Wait, yeah, that's right. Because the solid angle is the area divided by the square of the radius, all in steradians.

So plugging in the numbers, A is 0.24 m², and r is 0.6 m. So r squared is 0.36 m². Then Ω = 0.24 / 0.36. Let me compute that. 0.24 divided by 0.36... Well, 0.24 is 24/100, and 0.36 is 36/100. So (24/100) / (36/100) = 24/36 = 2/3. Oh wait, that's 2/3 steradians. Hmm, looking at the options, option G is 2/3. So is that the answer?

Wait a second, let me check my steps again to be sure. The area given is on the sphere's surface, so the formula should be correct. The radius calculation is right, 0.6 m. Area converted correctly to 0.24 m². And 0.24 / 0.36 is indeed two-thirds. So yeah, the solid angle is 2/3 steradians. So the correct answer must be option G.

To determine the solid angle subtended by an area of 2400 cm² on the surface of a sphere with a diameter of 1.2 m, we start by converting the units to ensure consistency. The area in square meters is:

\[
A = 2400 \, \text{cm}^2 = 2400 \times (0.01 \, \text{m})^2 = 0.24 \, \text{m}^2.
\]

The sphere's radius is half of its diameter:

\[
r = \frac{1.2 \, \text{m}}{2} = 0.6 \, \text{m}.
\]

The formula for solid angle \( \Omega \) in steradians is:

\[
\Omega = \frac{A}{r^2}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Omega = \frac{0.24 \, \text{m}^2}{(0.6 \, \text{m})^2} = \frac{0.24}{0.36} = \frac{2}{3}.
\]

Thus, the solid angle is \( \frac{2}{3} \) steradians. Comparing this result with the provided options, the correct answer is:

**G: \( \frac{2}{3} \).**

Answer: G
