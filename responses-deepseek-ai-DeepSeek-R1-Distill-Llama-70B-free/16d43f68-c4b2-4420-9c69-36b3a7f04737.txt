Okay, so I've got this economics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about a factory owner deciding how many workers to hire to maximize profits. The wage rate is $30 per day. There's a table provided with the number of workers (I think) and their Value of Marginal Product per day. The options are from A to J, with numbers 3 to 12 as possible answers.

Wait, the table isn't shown here, but the data is given in the question. Let me parse that again. The input (Labor) is 6,7,8,9,10, and their corresponding Value of Marginal Product (VMP) per day is $50,70,35,20,10. Hmm, so for 6 workers, VMP is $50, 7 workers have VMP $70, and so on up to 10 workers with VMP $10.

Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Oh, wait, maybe the first number is the number of workers. So for 6 workers, the marginal product value is $50. For 7 workers, it's $70, then 35, 20, 10 as we go up to 10 workers.

But wait, I thought the Value of Marginal Product usually declines as more workers are added because of diminishing returns. So if that's the case, the VMP should decrease as the number of workers increases. But in the given data, when labor goes from 6 to 7, VMP increases from 50 to 70. That seems odd. Unless maybe it's not the number of workers, but the quantity of labor in some other units. Hmm, maybe I should proceed assuming that the numbers 6,7,8,9,10 are the number of workers, each contributing a VMP as listed.

So the wage rate is $30 per worker per day. The factory owner wants to maximize profits, which are total revenues minus total costs. But since we don't have total revenues, we can use the concept that profit is maximized when marginal revenue equals marginal cost. In the context of labor, the VMP is the marginal revenue product (MRP), which is the additional revenue from adding one more worker. The marginal cost of hiring an additional worker is the wage rate, which is $30.

So the rule is to hire workers up to the point where VMP equals the wage rate. So we look for the number of workers where VMP is just greater than or equal to $30. Wait, no, actually, the optimal point is where VMP equals the wage rate. But sometimes, if the VMP is higher than the wage, you hire; if lower, you don't. So you keep hiring as long as the next worker's VMP is greater than or equal to the wage.

Wait, let's think again. Profit is maximized when the marginal benefit (VMP) equals the marginal cost (wage). So you should hire workers until the VMP of the next worker is less than the wage rate. So you stop before hiring a worker whose VMP is below the wage.

So let's list out the workers and their VMP:

Number of workers: 6, VMP $50
7: 70
8:35
9:20
10:10

Wait, but that's not making sense because with each additional worker beyond 6, the VMP first increases from 6 to 7, then drops. So 6 workers: $50, 7:70, which is higher, then 8:35, which is lower than 7 but higher than 6. Wait no, 35 is lower than 50. So let me list them correctly:

Wait, no, the data is given as: for 6 workers, VMP is 50; 7 workers, VMP 70; 8:35; 9:20; 10:10.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the table. Maybe the numbers 6,7,8,9,10 are the number of workers, and each represents the marginal product of the nth worker. So for worker 6, the VMP is $50; worker 7 adds $70, etc. But that seems a bit off because typically, as you add more workers, the marginal product would decrease due to diminishing returns. But in this case, worker 7 has a higher VMP than worker 6, which is possible, perhaps due to increasing returns, but then it drops for worker 8.

So the wage rate is $30 per worker per day. So for each additional worker beyond a certain point, their VMP should be compared to $30.

Wait, maybe it's better to list each possible number of workers and calculate whether adding them increases profit.

So let's make a list:

Number of workers | VMP per additional worker

6 | $50
7 | $70
8 | $35
9 | $20
10 | $10

Wait, so each number represents the number of workers, and the VMP is the marginal product of adding that worker. So when you have 6 workers, the marginal product of the 6th worker is $50. When you add a 7th, their VMP is $70. Wait, that seems a bit confusing because the 7th worker adds more than the 6th, which would mean that productivity is increasing at that point. But perhaps that's possible.

Wait, perhaps the table is structured as the number of workers (labor) and their corresponding VMP, so 6 workers have a VMP of $50, 7 workers have $70, etc. So the VMP is the total value contributed by each worker? No, that doesn't make sense. No, the VMP is the marginal product, so it's the additional value from each additional worker.

Wait, maybe I got the table wrong. Let me read the question again.

"Input (Labor) Value of Marginal Product per day 6 7 8 9 10 $50 70 35 20 10"

Ah, perhaps the way it's written is that for each quantity of labor (number of workers), the VMP is as follows:

Labor quantity: 6, VMP is $50

Labor quantity:7, VMP is $70

And so on up to 10.

Wait, but that can't be right because when you increase labor from 6 to 7, the VMP increases from 50 to 70. So the 7th worker adds more than the 6th? That would be increasing returns, which is possible but less common than diminishing returns.

Alternatively, perhaps the table is that the first worker (1) has VMP of $50, second (2) $70, etc., but no, because the numbers listed start at 6.

Wait, perhaps the table is structured such that the first data point is for 6 workers, and their VMP is $50, then 7 workers have $70, etc. So each additional worker beyond 5 adds the VMP as per the table.

Wait, maybe the data is as follows:

If the factory hires 6 workers, the marginal product of the 6th worker is $50 per day.

If it hires 7 workers, the marginal product of the 7th worker is $70.

Wait, that can't be, because the 7th worker's VMP is higher than the 6th, which would indicate increasing marginal returns. But then for the 8th worker, it's $35, which is lower than the 7th.

So let's list the VMP for each additional worker as we go from 0 upwards, but the data starts at 6. Hmm, perhaps the data is missing for 0-5 workers. But in this case, perhaps the factory is considering whether to go beyond 5 workers, and the options are from 6 upwards.

Wait, but the options given are from 3 to 12. The possible answers are A:8, B:9, etc., but the data starts at 6 workers. So maybe the question is about how many workers beyond 5 to hire, but the options include lower numbers. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it.

Let me think differently. The factory owner wants to maximize profits by choosing the optimal number of workers. The profit is maximized when the VMP of the last worker hired equals the wage rate. So, find the number of workers where the VMP is equal to or just above $30, and the next worker's VMP is below $30.

So, the wage rate is $30. Let's list the VMP for each possible worker.

Wait, perhaps the table is structured such that for each worker (from 6 to 10), their VMP is as follows:

Worker 6: $50

Worker 7: $70

Worker 8: $35

Worker 9: $20

Worker 10: $10

Wait, but that would mean that each additional worker beyond 5 adds the VMP as shown. So worker 6 adds $50, worker 7 adds $70 (which is higher than 6, so increasing returns), worker 8 adds $35, which is lower than 7, so now diminishing returns kick in.

So the wage rate is $30. So we need to find up to which worker the VMP is greater than or equal to $30.

So:

- Hire worker 6: VMP $50 > $30 → Profitable, hire.

- Hire worker 7: VMP $70 >30 → Hire.

- Hire worker 8: VMP $35>30 → Hire.

- Hire worker 9: VMP $20 <30 → Don't hire.

- Hire worker 10: VMP $10 <30 → Don't hire.

So the optimal number of workers would be up to worker 8. So 8 workers in total.

Wait, but wait—how many workers is that? If we start counting from 6 as the first worker, but no, I think the workers are numbered starting from 1. But in the data, it's given as 6,7,8,9,10, which are the number of workers, not the worker number. So when the factory hires 6 workers, the 6th worker's VMP is $50.

Wait, maybe I should think of it as the marginal product of each additional worker beyond the previous.

So, the VMP for the 6th worker is $50, which is higher than $30, so hire.

The 7th worker has VMP $70, so hire.

The 8th worker: $35>30 → hire.

The 9th: $20 <30 → don't hire.

So maximum profit is achieved by hiring up to 8 workers.

Wait, but the options given are:

A: Eight (8)

B: Nine (9)

C: Four

D: Eleven

E: Twelve

F: Ten

G: Three

H: Five

I: Seven

J: Six

So option A is 8, which would be the correct choice.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting the table correctly. The way the table is written is: "Input (Labor) Value of Marginal Product per day 6 7 8 9 10 $50 70 35 20 10". So perhaps it's that when the input (number of workers) is 6, the VMP is $50; when input is 7, VMP is $70, etc. That would mean that the VMP is the marginal product of the last worker hired when you have that number of workers.

Wait, for example, if you have 6 workers, the 6th worker's VMP is $50. If you have 7 workers, the 7th worker's VMP is $70. So each time you add a worker, their VMP is as per the table.

So, to decide whether to hire each worker, compare their VMP to the wage.

So:

- 6 workers: 6th worker's VMP $50 > $30 → profitable, hire.

- 7 workers: 7th worker's VMP $70 >30 → hire.

- 8 workers: 8th's VMP $35>30 → hire.

- 9 workers: 9th's VMP $20<30 → don't hire.

- 10 workers: 10th's VMP $10<30 → don't hire.

So the maximum number of workers where VMP ≥ wage is 8 workers. So the answer is 8, which is option A.
</think>

To determine how many workers the factory owner should hire to maximize profits, we compare the Value of Marginal Product (VMP) of each additional worker to the wage rate of $30 per day. The optimal number of workers is the point where the VMP of the last worker hired is equal to or just above the wage rate, and the next worker's VMP is below the wage rate.

The data provided is as follows:

| Number of Workers | VMP per Additional Worker |
|--------------------|----------------------------|
| 6                  | $50                        |
| 7                  | $70                        |
| 8                  | $35                        |
| 9                  | $20                        |
| 10                 | $10                        |

Key observations:
1. For 6 workers, the VMP is $50, which is greater than $30. Hiring the 6th worker is profitable.
2. For 7 workers, the VMP is $70, which is greater than $30. Hiring the 7th worker is profitable.
3. For 8 workers, the VMP is $35, which is greater than $30. Hiring the 8th worker is profitable.
4. For 9 workers, the VMP is $20, which is less than $30. Hiring the 9th worker is not profitable.
5. For 10 workers, the VMP is $10, which is less than $30. Hiring the 10th worker is not profitable.

Thus, the factory owner should hire up to 8 workers, as this is the point where the VMP of the last worker equals or exceeds the wage rate, and hiring additional workers would reduce profits.

The correct answer is **A: Eight**.
