Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about ring homomorphisms and ideals. I'm a bit rusty on my ring theory, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

The question has two statements. Statement 1 says, "A ring homomorphism is one to one if and only if the kernel is {0}." Statement 2 says, "Q is an ideal in R." Then there are options from A to J, each pairing of true/false for the two statements.

Starting with Statement 1. I remember that in group theory, a homomorphism is injective if and only if the kernel is trivial (just the identity element). Does the same apply to ring homomorphisms? Rings are more complex because they have two operations, addition and multiplication. So a ring homomorphism has to preserve both. 

Wait, but the kernel of a ring homomorphism is defined as the set of elements that map to the additive identity in the target ring. So for rings, if the kernel only contains the zero element, does that mean the homomorphism is injective? I think so because if two elements are mapped to the same element, their difference would be in the kernel. If the kernel is just zero, that implies the elements must be the same, which is injectivity. 

So Statement 1 seems to be true. But wait, is it an 'if and only if'? So not only does a trivial kernel imply injectivity, but also injectivity implies trivial kernel. Because if the homomorphism is injective, then the kernel can't have any elements besides zero, right? Yeah, that makes sense. So Statement 1 is true.

Now Statement 2: "Q is an ideal in R." Wait, but I don't have any context about what Q and R are. The question doesn't provide any information about these rings. So without knowing what Q and R are, I can't determine whether Q is an ideal in R. So the truth value of Statement 2 is not given. 

Looking at the options, I need to find which option has Statement 1 as True and Statement 2 as Not Given. Let's review the options:

Option A: True, False → So Statement 2 is false. But I don't know that; it's not given.

Option B: Not Given, Not Given → No, because I know Statement 1 is true.

Option C: False, False → No, because Statement 1 is true.

Option D: Not Given, True → No, Statement 1 is true, so first should be true.

Option E: True, Not Given → Yes, this fits. Statement 1 is true, Statement 2 is not given.

Option F: Not Given, False → No, same as option A but first is wrong.

Option G: True, True → No, because Statement 2's status isn't given.

Option H: False, True → No, Statement 1 is true.

Option I: False, Not Given → No, Statement 1 is true.

So the correct option should be E: True, Not Given.

The question evaluates two statements about ring theory. 

**Statement 1**: "A ring homomorphism is one to one if and only if the kernel is {0}." This is true because, in ring theory, a ring homomorphism is injective if and only if its kernel contains only the zero element. This is analogous to group theory, where the kernel being trivial implies injectivity.

**Statement 2**: "Q is an ideal in R." There is no information provided about the rings Q and R, so the truth value of this statement cannot be determined. 

Analyzing the options, the correct choice is **E: True, Not Given**, as Statement 1 is true and Statement 2's status is unknown.
