Okay, so I've got this economics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about what happens when there's an unplanned decrease in inventories. Hmm, I remember that inventories are like the stock of goods that businesses have on hand. So an unplanned decrease would mean that businesses have sold more than they expected, right?

Wait, so if inventories are going down unexpectedly, that probably means that demand is higher than what businesses anticipated. Because if people are buying more, the stock goes down. But since it's unplanned, businesses might not have produced enough to meet that higher demand.

I think this relates to the production and sales cycle. When inventories fall, businesses would typically respond by increasing production to restock. So they'd likely ramp up output. But looking at the options, I need to see which ones align with that.

Option A says output begins to rise. That makes sense because if they need to rebuild inventory, they'll produce more. Option D says production slows down, which seems the opposite, so probably not D.

What about the other options? Option B is output falling, which doesn't fit. Option C and F are about saving, which I'm not sure ties directly here. Option E is demand decreasing, which doesn't make sense because higher demand would cause the inventory drop. Option G talks about a recession, but an unplanned inventory decrease might actually be a sign of strong demand, not a downturn.

Option H is inflation increasing. If demand is high and production increases, maybe prices could go up if there's strain on resources, but I'm not sure if that's the immediate effect. Option I is prices falling, which seems unlikely if demand is up.

So putting it together, when inventories drop unexpectedly, businesses will likely increase production to meet the higher demand. So the correct answer should be A: output begins to rise. Wait, but some sources I've read before might say that a decrease in inventories could lead to an increase in production. But I'm trying to remember the exact mechanism.

Another way to think about it: the inventory cycle. If actual inventory is lower than desired, firms will produce more. So yes, production should rise. So the answer should be A.

When there is an unplanned decrease in inventories, it typically indicates that businesses have sold more goods than anticipated, suggesting stronger-than-expected demand. In response, businesses are likely to increase production to replenish their inventories and meet the higher demand. This makes Option A, "output to begin to rise," the most appropriate choice.

Other options can be ruled out as follows:
- **B (output to begin to fall)** and **D (production to slow down)** are incorrect because production would increase, not decrease, to address the inventory shortfall.
- **C (saving to begin to rise)** and **F (saving to begin to fall)** are unrelated to the immediate context of inventory changes.
- **E (demand to decrease)** is incorrect because the unplanned inventory drop implies higher demand.
- **G (the economy to enter a recession)** and **H (inflation to increase)** are broader economic conditions not directly tied to this specific scenario.
- **I (prices to begin to fall)** is unlikely, as higher demand typically leads to stable or rising prices.

Thus, the correct answer is **A: output to begin to rise.**

Answer: A
