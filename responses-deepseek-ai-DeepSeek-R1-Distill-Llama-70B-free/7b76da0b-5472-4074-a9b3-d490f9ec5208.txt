Okay, so I have this question about the HOUSE’S PATH-GOAL THEORY OF LEADERSHIP and the instrumental leadership style. Hmm, I remember that Path-Goal Theory is one of the leadership theories I studied earlier. Let me think.

Path-Goal Theory suggests that a leader's role is to help subordinates achieve their goals by providing the necessary support, resources, and guidance. It's about clearing the path to the goal, right? So the theory emphasizes how leaders can help subordinates by removing obstacles and providing the tools they need to succeed.

Now, the question is about the instrumental leadership style. Wait, instrumental versus supportive leadership. I think in Path-Goal Theory, there are different types of leader behaviors, like directive, supportive, participative, and achievement-oriented. Oh wait, maybe it's directive and supportive? Or perhaps instrumental is another term.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Instrumental leadership... I think it's more about the leader giving specific instructions and ensuring tasks are done correctly. It's task-oriented. So in the context of Path-Goal Theory, the instrumental style would be about providing clear guidelines and structures to help subordinates reach their goals. That makes sense because if the leader sets clear paths, subordinates know what's expected and can perform better.

Looking at the options:

A: Positive work environment – that sounds more like supportive leadership, which focuses on employee well-being.

B: Includes in decision-making – that's more of a participative style.

C: Feedback and recognition – supportive again.

D: Work independently – maybe more of a laissez-faire style.

E: Challenging goals – that's achievement-oriented.

F: Supportive relationships – again, supportive.

G: Team building – maybe transformational leadership.

H: Employee engagement – sounds like a supportive approach.

I: Develop own goals – possibly participative or empowering.

J: Guidelines and rules – that sounds instrumental, providing clear structures.

So the question is asking how the instrumental style works. Instrumental is about being task-focused, giving clear instructions. So option J says provides specific guidelines and clear rules and procedures. That fits.
