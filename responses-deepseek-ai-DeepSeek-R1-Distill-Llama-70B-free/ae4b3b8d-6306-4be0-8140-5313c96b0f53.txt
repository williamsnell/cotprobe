Question:

A man outraged by the recent church decision to clear a famous philosopher of charges of heresy, decided to present a lecture, open to the public, disproving the philosopher's theories. A state statute provides that: "state universities can permit the use of their lecture halls to the public for worthwhile programs of public benefit, upon approval of the school board. "The appropriate school board refused to make a university lecture hall available to the man on the grounds that the proposed lecture was not of worthwhile benefit to the public. As a result, the man brought suit in a state court against the school board and requested injunctive relief requiring the board to allow him the use of the lecture hall. The trial court denied relief and dismissed the suit. The judgment was affirmed by the state appellate court, and is now before the U. S. Supreme Court. In analyzing the state statute, which of the following statements is least accurate?

Options:

A: The statute is unconstitutionally overbroad, because it may result in the exclusion of protected speech as well as unprotected speech.
B: The statute, as applied to the man, does not violate his First Amendment rights because his proposed speech is not political and, therefore, not among the classes of speech that are protected.
C: Indirect speech, regulations are only permissible if necessary to serve compelling state interests.
D: The statute is a prior restraint on speech, which unconstitutionally vests unfettered discretion in the school board to decide who may use university lecture halls.

Okay, so I have this constitutional law question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand it.

So, there's a man who's upset about a church decision, and he wants to give a public lecture to disprove a philosopher's theories that were cleared of heresy charges. The state statute says that state universities can permit the use of their lecture halls for public programs that are of public benefit, but they need approval from the school board. The school board denied his request, saying his lecture wasn't worthwhile for the public. He sued for an injunction to make them allow him, but the trial and appellate courts denied him, and now it's before the U.S. Supreme Court.

The question is about analyzing the state statute and determining which statement is least accurate. The options are A through D.

Alright, let's break this down. First, I think this is a First Amendment case, probably involving free speech and whether the government can restrict access to public facilities based on content.

Looking at the statute, it allows use of lecture halls for "worthwhile programs of public benefit" with school board approval. So the school board has discretion to decide what's worthwhile. That makes me think about content-based restrictions because they're evaluating the content of the proposed speech (the lecture) to decide whether to allow it.

In constitutional law, content-based restrictions on speech are generally subject to strict scrutiny. That means the government must show that the restriction is necessary to serve a compelling state interest and is narrowly tailored. If the statute gives too much discretion to the school board without clear guidelines, it might be unconstitutional because it could lead to arbitrary suppression of speech.

Now, looking at each option:

Option A: The statute is unconstitutionally overbroad because it may exclude protected speech. An overbroad statute is one that could potentially punish constitutionally protected speech along with unprotected speech. If the statute allows the school board to reject any program they don't deem worthwhile, without specific guidelines, it could chill protected speech. So A seems like a plausible accurate statement.

Option B: The statute doesn't violate his rights because his speech isn't political and thus not protected. Wait, the First Amendment protects more than just political speech. It also covers artistic, scientific, and educational speech, among others. The philosopher's theories being discussed could be academic or philosophical, which are protected. So B is probably inaccurate because it's incorrectly stating that non-political speech isn't protected. But I'm not sure if the court would consider his speech as not political. Maybe it's more about academic freedom.

Option C: Indirect speech regulations are permissible only if necessary for compelling state interests. Indirect regulations, like time, place, and manner restrictions, are allowed if they are content-neutral, serve a significant government interest, and leave ample alternative channels of communication. So if the statute is content-neutral, it's subject to intermediate scrutiny. But if it's content-based, then strict scrutiny applies. The option says "only if necessary to serve compelling state interests," which aligns with strict scrutiny. But if the regulation is indirect and content-neutral, then maybe a significant interest is enough. So I'm not sure if C is accurate. Wait, the statement says "indirect speech regulations are only permissible if necessary to serve compelling state interests." That would imply strict scrutiny, but indirect and content-neutral might only need significant interests. So maybe C is incorrect because it's stating a higher standard than necessary.

Option D: The statute is a prior restraint, giving unfettered discretion to the school board. Prior restraints are disfavored and subject to strict scrutiny. If the statute allows the school board to decide based on content without clear standards, it's a prior restraint with too much discretion, which is unconstitutional. So D is an accurate statement.

Now, the question is which option is least accurate, meaning incorrect.

Looking again:

Option B says his speech isn't political, so it's not protected. But that's wrong because the First Amendment protects more than just political speech. So B is inaccurate.

Option C's statement about compelling interests might be incorrect because indirect regulations might not require compelling interests if they're content-neutral. Wait, let me think. Content-neutral time, place, manner restrictions require a significant governmental interest, not compelling. So if the statute is content-neutral, then C's statement would be wrong because it's applying the higher standard. But in this case, the statute is about the content (worthwhile, public benefit), so it's content-based, meaning strict scrutiny applies. So in that case, the regulation would need to serve a compelling interest. So C might be accurate because it's talking about indirect regulations needing compelling interests. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, the statute is about the content of the speech, so it's a content-based regulation. Therefore, it's subject to strict scrutiny, which requires compelling interest and narrow tailoring. So for content-based, yes, compelling. But if the regulation was content-neutral, then it's intermediate scrutiny.

The option says "indirect speech regulations are only permissible if necessary to serve compelling..." So if the regulation is indirect (like a time/place/manner) but content-based, then yes, it needs compelling. But if it's content-neutral, it's a different standard. So perhaps the statement in C is accurate when the regulation is content-based. But the question is about whether the option is accurate in describing the statute.

Wait, the statute is content-based, so the correct standard would be strict scrutiny. So C's statement would be accurate because it says indirect regulations (which this is, as it's about access to a facility) are only permissible if serving compelling interests. So C is accurate.

So going back, the inaccurate statements are B and possibly C, but I think B is definitely wrong because it's saying non-political speech isn't protected, which is incorrect.

So the question is which is least accurate. So the least accurate would be the wrong statement.

Looking at the options, the least accurate is option B because it's incorrect about the scope of First Amendment protection. The other options may have issues, but B is clearly wrong.

To analyze the question, we must evaluate the state statute and determine which statement is least accurate under constitutional law principles, particularly the First Amendment.

### Key Analysis of Each Option:

1. **Option A**:  
   The statute is criticized as unconstitutionally overbroad because it may exclude both protected and unprotected speech. This is plausible because the statute grants the school board discretion to decide what is "worthwhile" and of "public benefit" without clear guidelines, potentially chilling protected speech. Thus, this statement is accurate.

2. **Option B**:  
   This option claims that the statute does not violate the man's First Amendment rights because his speech is not political and therefore unprotected. However, the First Amendment protects more than just political speechâ€”it also covers academic, philosophical, and educational speech. The man's lecture, which seeks to disprove a philosopher's theories, likely falls into one of these protected categories. Therefore, this statement is inaccurate.

3. **Option C**:  
   This option states that indirect speech regulations are only permissible if necessary to serve compelling state interests. Since the statute is content-based (it evaluates the "worthwhile" nature of the speech), it is subject to strict scrutiny, which requires the government to show a compelling state interest. The statement aligns with this standard, making it accurate.

4. **Option D**:  
   This option argues that the statute is a prior restraint that vests unfettered discretion in the school board. Prior restraints are indeed disfavored and subject to strict scrutiny. The statute's vague language could allow arbitrary decisions, making this statement accurate.

### Conclusion:  
The least accurate statement is **Option B**, as it incorrectly assumes that non-political speech is unprotected. The First Amendment protects a broad range of speech, including academic and philosophical expression, which this lecture likely represents.

Answer: B
