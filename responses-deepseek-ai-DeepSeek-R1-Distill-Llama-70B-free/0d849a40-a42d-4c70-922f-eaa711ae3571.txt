Okay, so I've got this problem here about discounts and finding the net price. Let me see if I can figure it out step by step. The question is about a Speedway Racing Set that's list-priced at $32. They're giving two discounts: 10% and 20%. I need to find the net price after applying both discounts.

Hmm, wait, I'm a bit confused about how to apply two discounts. Do I apply them one after the other, or do I add them up first? I remember something about this from math class. Oh right, when you have two successive discounts, you don't just add the percentages. Instead, you apply the first discount, then apply the second discount on the new price.

So first, let's calculate the 10% discount on $32. 10% of 32 is... 0.10 times 32 equals $3.20. So subtracting that from the original price: 32 - 3.20 = $28.80. So after the first discount, the price is $28.80.

Now, the second discount is 20%, but this time it's applied to the new price of $28.80. So I need to find 20% of 28.80. Let me calculate that: 0.20 * 28.80. Hmm, 0.2 times 28 is 5.6, and 0.2 times 0.80 is 0.16, so adding those together gives 5.76. So the second discount is $5.76.

Subtracting that from the $28.80 gives me the net price. So 28.80 minus 5.76... Let me do that subtraction. 28 minus 5 is 23, 0.80 minus 0.76 is 0.04. So 23 + 0.04 is $23.04. 

Wait, but let me double-check that calculation. Another way to do it: 28.80 - 5.76 = 23.04. Yeah, that seems right.

Looking at the options, I see option I is $23.04. But wait, I should make sure I didn't make a mistake in the order of discounts. Alternatively, maybe I should have applied the larger discount first? Let me try that approach to see if it changes the result.

So applying 20% discount first on $32. 20% of 32 is 6.40, so the price becomes 32 - 6.40 = $25.60. Then applying 10% discount on $25.60. 10% of 25.60 is 2.56. Subtract that: 25.60 - 2.56 = $23.04. Oh, same result. So it doesn't matter which order the discounts are applied in because the overall discount would be the same. So the net price is $23.04.

Wait, but why does the order not matter? Oh because multiplication is commutative. Applying 10% then 20% is same as 0.9 * 0.8 = 0.72. Alternatively, 0.8 * 0.9 is also 0.72. So the combined effect is 72% of the original price. Let me check that: 0.72 times 32 is 23.04. Yep, same answer.

So the correct option must be I: $23.04. Let me look at the options again. Option I is $23.04. So I think that's the right choice.

The problem involves calculating the net price of the Speedway Racing Set after applying two successive discounts of 10% and 20% to the list price of $32. 

First, the 10% discount is applied to $32:
\[
\text{Discount} = 0.10 \times 32 = 3.20 \quad \text{New Price} = 32 - 3.20 = 28.80
\]

Next, the 20% discount is applied to the new price of $28.80:
\[
\text{Discount} = 0.20 \times 28.80 = 5.76 \quad \text{Net Price} = 28.80 - 5.76 = 23.04
\]

The order of applying the discounts does not affect the final result because the combined effect of the discounts is equivalent to multiplying the original price by \( 0.9 \times 0.8 = 0.72 \):
\[
\text{Net Price} = 0.72 \times 32 = 23.04
\]

Thus, the net price of the Speedway Racing Set is **$23.04**, which corresponds to option I.
