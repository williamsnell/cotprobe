Okay, so I've got this genetics question about snapdragons. Hmm, I remember that snapdragons have different flower colors based on their genotype. Let me try to break this down.

The question says that plants homozygous for red (I guess that's RR) have red flowers. Those homozygous for white (maybe Rr? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, usually capitals are dominant. Wait, wait, in this case, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think. Oh wait, the wording is: red is homozygous red, white is homozygous white, and heterozygous are pink.

Wait, so let me get this straight. So, red is RR, white is rr? Or is it the other way around? Because in the question, when they're heterozygous, they're pink. So maybe the red is dominant and white is recessive.

Wait, but in the question, the homozygous red has red, homozygous white has white, and heterozygous is pink. So that suggests that red is dominant because the heterozygote shows a different phenotype, which isn't just a blending. So, red is dominant, white is recessive. So the alleles: let's say R is dominant (red), r is recessive (white). So RR is red, Rr is pink, rr is white.

Wait, no, wait. Because the question says that homozygous red is red, homozygous white is white, and heterozygous is pink. So that implies that when you have two different alleles, you get a different color. So, the possible genotypes are RR, Rr, rr. RR is red, Rr is pink, rr is white.

So now, the cross is between a pink flowered plant and a white flowered plant. So the pink is Rr, because heterozygous gives pink. And the white is homozygous, so rr.

So the cross is Rr (pink) x rr (white). What are the possible gametes from each parent?

Rr can produce two types of gametes: R and r, each with 50% chance. The rr plant can only produce gametes with r, 100% of the time.

So the possible offspring would get one allele from each parent. So for each parent:

Rr x rr:

The Rr parent gives either R or r.

The rr parent gives r.

So possible offspring genotypes:

If Rr gives R, then offspring is Rr (since R from one parent and r from the other).

If Rr gives r, then offspring is rr.

So the possible genotypes are 50% Rr and 50% rr.

Now, what are the phenotypes for these genotypes?

Rr is pink, and rr is white.

So 50% of the progeny will be pink, and 50% white.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's check each one.

Option A: (1/2) RʹR pink (1/2) RʹRʹ white. Wait, Rʹ is probably another allele; maybe the notation is different. Oh wait, perhaps R and R' are different? No, wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe the options are using a different notation. So in the question, the alleles are R and r, perhaps. But the options have R and R', which I'm not sure about.

Wait, maybe the options are using R and R' as the two dominant or something else. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

In the cross, the parents are Rr (pink) and rr (white). So the possible gametes are R and r from Rr, and r from rr.

So the possible offspring will be Rr (50%) and rr (50%).

Rr is pink, rr is white. So the phenotypic ratio is 1:1, pink to white.

Looking at the options, we need to find which option shows 50% pink and 50% white.

Let me check each option:

Option A: 1/2 RʹR pink, 1/2 RʹRʹ white. So that's 1/2 each. But what are the genotypes here? RʹR would be heterozygous, so pink. RʹRʹ is homozygous, so white. So yes, that gives 1/2 pink and 1/2 white. But wait, in our cross, the possible genotypes are Rr and rr, not RʹR and RʹRʹ. So maybe the notation is different. If Rʹ is a different allele, perhaps Rʹ is equivalent to r. Wait, maybe the question uses R and R' as the two possible alleles, but that would mean three alleles, which is unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps R' is the same as r, but that's confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps in the options, Rʹ is just a way to write R, but that seems odd. So perhaps option A is correct. But let me see the other options.

Option B: 1/4 RR red, 3/4 RʹRʹ white. That's 25% red, so not matching our expected 50% pink and 50% white.

Option C: 3/4 RʹRʹ white, 1/4 RʹR pink. So 75% white, 25% pink. No, that's not our case.

Option D: All RʹR pink. No, because some are rr (white).

Option E: 3/4 RʹR pink, 1/4 RʹRʹ white. That's 75% pink, 25% white. Not matching.

Option F: 1/2 RʹRʹ white, 1/2 RR red. That's 50% white and 50% red. So no, because in our case, it's pink and white.

Option G: 1/3 RʹRʹ white, 2/3 RR red. So that's not matching.

Option H: All RʹRʹ white. No, because some are pink.

Option I: 1/2 RR red, 1/2 RʹR pink. So 50% red and 50% pink. No, because we have white and pink.

Option J: 1/2 RR red, 1/2 RʹRʹ white. So 50% red and 50% white. But in our cross, the possible phenotypes are pink (Rr) and white (rr). So this option has red and white, which doesn't match.

Wait, so none of the options seem to match except option A. But in option A, the genotypes are RʹR and RʹRʹ. So if Rʹ is the recessive allele, perhaps Rʹ is same as r.

Wait, perhaps in the question, the white color is the recessive phenotype, so rr is white. So perhaps Rʹ is the same as r. So in that case, the cross Rr x rr would produce Rr (pink) and rr (white). So the phenotypic ratio is 1:1 pink to white.

Looking back at the options, option A says 1/2 RʹR pink and 1/2 RʹRʹ white. So if Rʹ is r, then RʹR is same as Rr, which is pink. So option A is correct.

Wait, but let me make sure. Because the cross is Rr x rr, so the possible offspring are Rr (pink) and rr (white). So the options that have 50% pink (Rr) and 50% white (rr) would be correct.

Looking again, the options:

Option A: 1/2 RʹR (pink) and 1/2 RʹRʹ (white). So yes, this fits.

But wait, another thought: perhaps the notation in the options is using Rʹ as the dominant allele and R as recessive? That would change things. But I don't think so because the question states that homozygous red is RR, which is red. So R is dominant, and r is recessive.

Wait, perhaps the options are using R and r, but written as Rʹ. Alternatively, maybe the question uses Rʹ as the other allele. Oh, perhaps the question is using R and Rʹ as the two possible alleles, but that's not the usual notation. Normally, it's R and r, capital and lowercase.

But in the question, the genotypes are RR, Rr, and rr. So the options are using R and Rʹ, which might be a different way of writing. So perhaps Rʹ is the same as r. If that's the case, then RʹR would be equivalent to Rr, which would be pink, and RʹRʹ would be rr, which is white.

So in that case, option A is correct.

Wait, but the expected phenotypic ratio is 1:1, pink and white. So the correct answer would be option A.

But looking back, another possibility is that the cross is Rr x rr, so the possible offspring are Rr (pink) and rr (white). So 50% each.

Looking at the options, only option A and J have 50% pink and 50% something else.

Wait, option J is 1/2 RR red and 1/2 RʹRʹ white. So that's 50% red and 50% white, which doesn't match the expected phenotypes.

Option I is 1/2 RR red and 1/2 RʹR pink. So 50% red, 50% pink. No, because our cross doesn't produce any red.

Wait, so the correct answer must be option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting confused with the notation. Let me think again.

In the cross, the parents are Rr (pink) and rr (white). The possible gametes are R and r (from Rr) and r (from rr). So the offspring are Rr (50%) and rr (50%). So phenotypically, 50% pink and 50% white.

Looking at the options, the only one that gives 50% pink and 50% white is option A: 1/2 RʹR pink and 1/2 RʹRʹ white.

So the correct answer should be option A.

In snapdragons, the flower color is determined by the genotype at a single gene locus. The alleles involved are R (dominant, associated with red) and r (recessive, associated with white). The phenotypes are as follows:

- **RR**: Red flowers (homozygous dominant)
- **Rr**: Pink flowers (heterozygous)
- **rr**: White flowers (homozygous recessive)

The question involves a cross between a pink-flowered plant (Rr) and a white-flowered plant (rr). To determine the expected phenotypic results in the progeny, we analyze the possible genotypes and phenotypes:

1. **Gametes from the parents**:
   - The Rr parent can produce two types of gametes: **R** (50%) and **r** (50%).
   - The rr parent can only produce **r** gametes (100%).

2. **Possible offspring genotypes**:
   - Combining the gametes, the offspring genotypes are:
     - **Rr** (50%, from R × r)
     - **rr** (50%, from r × r)

3. **Phenotypes of the offspring**:
   - **Rr**: Pink flowers (heterozygous)
   - **rr**: White flowers (homozygous recessive)

Thus, the expected phenotypic ratio in the progeny is **1:1** (50% pink and 50% white).

### Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A**: (1/2) RʹR pink, (1/2) RʹRʹ white  
  This matches the expected phenotypic ratio of 50% pink and 50% white. Here, Rʹ likely represents the recessive allele (equivalent to r), so RʹR corresponds to Rr (pink), and RʹRʹ corresponds to rr (white).

- **Option B**: (1/4) RR red, (3/4) RʹRʹ white  
  This suggests a phenotypic ratio of 25% red and 75% white, which does not match the expected results.

- **Option C**: (3/4) RʹRʹ white, (1/4) RʹR pink  
  This suggests a phenotypic ratio of 75% white and 25% pink, which does not match the expected results.

- **Option D**: All RʹR pink  
  This suggests 100% pink flowers, which is incorrect.

- **Option E**: (3/4) RʹR pink, (1/4) RʹRʹ white  
  This suggests a phenotypic ratio of 75% pink and 25% white, which does not match the expected results.

- **Option F**: (1/2) RʹRʹ white, (1/2) RR red  
  This suggests a phenotypic ratio of 50% white and 50% red, which does not match the expected results.

- **Option G**: (1/3) RʹRʹ white, (2/3) RR red  
  This suggests a phenotypic ratio of 33% white and 67% red, which does not match the expected results.

- **Option H**: All RʹRʹ white  
  This suggests 100% white flowers, which is incorrect.

- **Option I**: (1/2) RR red, (1/2) RʹR pink  
  This suggests a phenotypic ratio of 50% red and 50% pink, which does not match the expected results.

- **Option J**: (1/2) RR red, (1/2) RʹRʹ white  
  This suggests a phenotypic ratio of 50% red and 50% white, which does not match the expected results.

### Conclusion:
The only option that correctly reflects the expected phenotypic ratio of 50% pink and 50% white is **Option A**.
