Alright, so I'm trying to figure out this discount series problem. It's part (a) and part (b). Let me take it step by step.

Starting with part (a), we have two discount series: 30-10-2½% and 25-15-2%. I need to determine which series gives a better discount overall. I remember that when applying multiple discounts successively, each discount is applied on the reduced price after the previous discount. So it's a matter of calculating the equivalent single discount for each series and comparing them.

Let's break down the first series: 30%, then 10%, then 2.5%. The formula for successive discounts is to multiply the remaining percentages after each discount. So for each step, it's (1 - discount rate). 

For the 30-10-2.5% series:
- After 30%: 70% remains (0.7)
- After 10%: 90% of that remains (0.9)
- After 2.5%: 97.5% remains (0.975)
Multiply them together: 0.7 * 0.9 * 0.975.

Let me calculate that:
0.7 * 0.9 is 0.63. Then 0.63 * 0.975. Hmm, 0.63 times 1 is 0.63. 0.63 * 0.975 = let's see, 0.63 * (1 - 0.025) = 0.63 - (0.63 * 0.025). 0.63 * 0.025 is 0.01575. So 0.63 - 0.01575 = 0.61425. So the equivalent is 1 - 0.61425 = 0.38575, which is 38.575% discount. Wait, wait, no. Wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, no, wait. Because the equivalent is the remaining percentage, so 0.61425 is the remaining, so discount is 1 - 0.61425 = 0.38575, which is 38.575%. So that's the equivalent single discount rate for the first series.

Now the second series: 25-15-2%. Let's compute that.

After 25% discount: 75% remains (0.75)
After 15%: 85% remains (0.85)
After 2%: 98% remains (0.98)
Multiply all: 0.75 * 0.85 * 0.98.

Calculating step by step:
0.75 * 0.85 = let's see, 0.75*0.8 is 0.6, 0.75*0.05 is 0.0375, so total 0.6375. Then 0.6375 * 0.98.

0.6375 * 0.98 = (0.6375 * 1) - (0.6375 * 0.02) = 0.6375 - 0.01275 = 0.62475. So the remaining is 0.62475, which means the discount is 1 - 0.62475 = 0.37525, or 37.525%.

So comparing the two series: 38.575% vs 37.525%. So the first series (30-10-2.5%) gives a better discount because 38.575% is a bigger discount than 37.525%. So in part (a), the 30-10-2.5% series is better.

Now moving to part (b): the discount series 15-15% versus a single rate of 30%. I need to find which is better.

Again, let's compute the equivalent for the 15-15% series.

First discount 15%: remaining is 85% (0.85)
Second discount 15%: remaining is 85% of that, so 0.85 * 0.85 = 0.7225. So the total remaining is 72.25%, meaning the discount is 1 - 0.7225 = 27.5% equivalent.

The single discount is 30%. Comparing 27.5% (from the series) to 30% (single rate). So the single rate gives a bigger discount. So the single rate of 30% is better than the 15-15% series.

So putting it all together:

(a) 30-10-2.5% is better than 25-15-2%.

(b) The single 30% rate is better than 15-15%.

Now, let's look at the answer options to see which one matches.

The options are A through J.

Looking at each option:

Option A: (a) 30-10-2½ and single 25% better. Wait, no, in (a) the 30-10-2.5% is better, but in (b) the single 30% is better. So in part (b), the single rate is 30%, not 25%. So option A is incorrect.

Option B: (a) single 25% and (b) 15-15% series better. No, because in (a) the series is better, not the single 25%. So B is wrong.

Option C: (a) 30 series better, (b) 15-15 better. No, because (b) single 30% is better. So C is wrong.

Option D: (a) 25 series and (b) single 30% better. No, because (a) 30 series is better. So D is wrong.

Option E: (a) 30 series better, (b) series and single 30% same. But in (b) single is better, so E is incorrect.

Option F: Both series equally beneficial. No, because in (a) one is better than the other.

Option G: (a) 25 series better, which is not correct, so G is wrong.

Option H: (a) 25 series better, which is wrong again.

Option I: (a) 25 series better, wrong.

Option J: (a) 30 series and (b) single 30% better. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me recheck. Because I thought part (b) says that the single rate of 30% is better than the 15-15% series. So looking at the options, looking for an option where (a) 30-10-2.5% is better, and (b) single 30% is better.

Looking at the options:

Option J says: "The series 30-10-2(1/2)% and the single rate of 30% are better." So that would mean for part (a), the series is better (correct), and part (b) the single 30% is better (correct). So option J matches.

Wait, but looking again at the options, let me make sure.

Option J reads: (a) 30-10-2½ % and (b) the single 30% are better. So yes.

Wait, looking at the options, the options are structured as (a) and (b) in the question. So each option says something about (a) and (b). 

Option J says: (a) The series 30-10-2½% and (b) the single rate of 30% are better. So that's correct.

Wait, but looking back, in (a), the two series are 30-10-2½% and 25-15-2%. We found that the first is better. So in (a), the 30 series is better. In (b), the single 30% is better. So the correct answer would be where (a) 30 series is better, and (b) single 30% is better. Looking for that in the options.

Looking again, the options are:

Option E: (a) 30 series better, but (b) no difference.

Option J: (a) 30 series, (b) single 30% better.

So J says for (a) the series is better, and for (b) the single 30% is better.

So according to our earlier analysis, J is correct.

Wait, but let me double-check part (b). The 15-15% series gives a 27.5% discount, which is less than 30%. So the single 30% is better. So yes, part (b) the single 30% is better.

So the correct answer is option J.

To determine which discount series or single rate is better, we calculate the equivalent single discount for each series by multiplying the remaining percentages after each discount. Here's the analysis:

### Part (a): Comparing 30-10-2½% and 25-15-2%
1. **30-10-2½% series**:
   - After 30%: \( 1 - 0.30 = 0.70 \)
   - After 10%: \( 0.70 \times (1 - 0.10) = 0.70 \times 0.90 = 0.63 \)
   - After 2.5%: \( 0.63 \times (1 - 0.025) = 0.63 \times 0.975 = 0.61425 \)
   - Total discount: \( 1 - 0.61425 = 0.38575 \) or **38.575%**.

2. **25-15-2% series**:
   - After 25%: \( 1 - 0.25 = 0.75 \)
   - After 15%: \( 0.75 \times (1 - 0.15) = 0.75 \times 0.85 = 0.6375 \)
   - After 2%: \( 0.6375 \times (1 - 0.02) = 0.6375 \times 0.98 = 0.62475 \)
   - Total discount: \( 1 - 0.62475 = 0.37525 \) or **37.525%**.

Since **38.575% > 37.525%**, the **30-10-2½% series** is better.

---

### Part (b): Comparing 15-15% and a single rate of 30%
1. **15-15% series**:
   - After 15%: \( 1 - 0.15 = 0.85 \)
   - After another 15%: \( 0.85 \times (1 - 0.15) = 0.85 \times 0.85 = 0.7225 \)
   - Total discount: \( 1 - 0.7225 = 0.2775 \) or **27.5%**.

2. **Single rate of 30%**:
   - Total discount: \( 1 - 0.30 = 0.70 \) or **30%**.

Since **30% > 27.5%**, the **single rate of 30%** is better.

---

### Final Answer:
- For part (a), the **30-10-2½% series** is better.
- For part (b), the **single rate of 30%** is better.

The correct option is **J: The series 30-10-2(1/2)% and the single rate of 30% are better**.

**Answer: J**
