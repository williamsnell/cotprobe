Okay, so I have this problem about determining the absolute entropy of cadmium at 298 K. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it.

The question gives me a table of temperatures in Kelvin and corresponding C_p values in cal/(deg·g-atom). Wait, wait, no, looking again, the units are probably cal/(K·g-atom) since it's heat capacity. Oh, right, because C_p is the molar heat capacity at constant pressure.

The problem says to assume the T³ law is valid below 12°C. Wait, but wait, 12°C is 285.15 K. Oh wait, no, 12 degrees Celsius is 285.15 K? Wait, no, 0°C is 273.15 K, so 12°C is 273.15 +12 = 285.15 K. Oh wait, but the data goes up to 298.16 K. So the T³ law applies only below 12°C, meaning below 285.15 K, right? But wait the data includes temperatures up to 298 K, which is 25°C. So I think the approach here is that we calculate the entropy using two parts: from 0 K to 12 K (wait no, 12°C is 285 K), wait no, wait, 12°C is 285 K. Wait, no, 12°C is 285 K. So temperatures below 285 K, the T³ law is valid. So the data starts at 12 K, wait, the first entry is 12 K? No, looking at the data:

The first column is labeled as °T_K, cadmium. Wait, the data starts at 12 K, 0.392, etc. So the temperatures given are from 12 K up to 298 K. So, to find the absolute entropy at 298 K, which is 25°C, we can't use the T³ law all the way. Because the T³ law applies only below 12°C (285 K), but our data starts at 12 K. Oh wait, wait, the problem says the T³ law is valid below 12°C, which is 285 K. But our data starts at 12 K, which is much lower.

Wait, but the T³ law (Debye's law) is applicable at low temperatures, typically much lower than room temperature. So perhaps the approach is to calculate the entropy in two parts: from 0 K to 12 K (using the T³ law) and from 12 K to 298 K using the provided C_p data.

Wait, but the data doesn't go below 12 K. The lowest temperature in the table is 12 K. So perhaps the way to proceed is to compute the entropy as the sum of two contributions: from 0 to 12 K using the T³ law, and from 12 K to 298 K using the provided C_p values.

But wait, the problem statement says to assume that the T³ law is valid below 12°C, which is 285 K. So wait, that's conflicting. Because 12°C is 285 K, and the T³ law is usually applicable at much lower temperatures. Hmm, maybe the problem is saying that for temperatures below 12 K, which is about -261°C, the T³ law applies. Because 12 K is very low. But the initial data starts at 12 K, so maybe that's the cutoff. Let me reread the question.

The question says: "Assume that T^3 law is valid below 12°C and also, there is no difference between C_p and C_v at these low temperatures." Wait, 12°C is 285 K. So for temperatures below 285 K, T^3 applies? No, that can't be right because at 285 K, which is about 12°C, the material is probably in the range where the Debye model isn't valid anymore. Hmm, perhaps the question intended to say that the T³ law is valid below 12 K? Because that makes more sense, as Debye's law applies at low temperatures.

Wait, but the data starts at 12 K. So maybe the way to proceed is to calculate the entropy from 0 to 12 K using the T³ law and then from 12 K to 298 K using the provided C_p data.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is saying that the T³ law is applicable for all temperatures below 12°C, but that seems unlikely. Wait, 12°C is 285 K, which is a relatively high temperature. So perhaps that's a typo, and it's supposed to say 12 K. But without knowing, I have to go with what's given.

Wait, the problem says that the T³ law is valid below 12°C (285 K), which is a higher temperature. But that's where I'm getting confused because Debye's law is for low temperatures. So perhaps the intended approach is to use the T³ law up to 12 K (which would be -261°C), and then use the given C_p data from 12 K to 298 K.

But wait, the data starts at 12 K, so maybe the T³ law is valid from 0 to 12 K, and the data from 12 K to 298 K. So for the entropy S at 298 K, it's the integral from 0 to 298 K of (C_p/T) dT. But we split the integral into two parts: from 0 to 12 K using the T³ law, and from 12 K to 298 K using the given C_p values.

But wait, the problem says to assume that the T³ law is valid below 12°C (285 K), but that's a higher temperature. So maybe the T³ law applies up to 285 K, but the data starts at 12 K, so perhaps the data is for temperatures above 12 K up to 298 K, and for the lower part (but the data starts at 12 K). This is getting a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps the T³ law is valid below 12 K. Let me think: 12°C is 285 K, which is high, but 12 K is 12 K, which is very low. So maybe the question had a typo, and it's 12 K, not 12°C. Because otherwise, using T³ law up to 285 K doesn't make sense, as the Debye model is for low temps.

But I have to go with what the question says. So the question says T³ law is valid below 12°C (285 K), so up to 285 K, the T³ law applies, and above that, use the given C_p data. Wait, but the data starts at 12 K (0.392) and goes up to 298 K (6.224). So perhaps the approach is:

- From 0 K to 12 K: Use the T³ law to find the entropy contribution.
- From 12 K to 285 K: Use T³ law? Or use the given data? Hmm, the data is given for 12 K and up. Wait, but if T³ applies up to 285 K, maybe the data is given for higher temps. Wait, but 12 K is way below 285 K, so perhaps the data is for when T³ isn't valid anymore. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the T³ law is applicable below 12 K. So for the temperatures below 12 K, we use the T³ law, and for 12 K and above, we use the given C_p data. Because the data starts at 12 K, which is the cutoff.

Given that, the entropy S at 298 K would be:

S = S_0 (from 0 to 12 K using T³) + integral from 12 K to 298 K of (C_p / T) dT.

But wait, the problem states that the T³ law is valid below 12°C, which is 285 K. So if T³ applies up to 285 K, but the data starts at 12 K, then perhaps the data is for when T >=12 K, but T³ applies up to 285 K.

Wait, this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to approach it step by step.

The problem wants the absolute entropy at 298 K. The data goes from 12 K to 298 K. The question says to use the T³ law below 12°C (285 K), and that C_p and C_v are the same at these low temps.

Wait, but that would mean that for T < 285 K, we can use the T³ law. But the data is for T >=12 K up to 298 K. So perhaps for calculating the entropy from 0 K to 298 K, we split it into two parts:

1. From 0 K to 285 K (12°C): Use the T³ law.
2. From 285 K to 298 K: Use the C_p data.

But wait, the data given starts at 12 K, not at 285 K. So perhaps the data is for when the T³ law doesn't apply, and the T³ law is only used from 0 to 12 K.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended that the T³ law applies below 12 K, so up to 12 K, and the data applies from 12 K onwards. That would make sense. So the correct approach is:

- From 0 K to 12 K: Use the T³ law to find the entropy contribution.
- From 12 K to 298 K: Use the given C_p values to calculate the entropy.

But then, I don't have C_p data below 12 K, so I can't use it. So I need to use the T³ law for the lower part.

Wait, but the problem says the T³ law is valid below 12°C (285 K). So perhaps the data is only valid for T >= 12 K, and for T <12 K, use the T³ law.

Wait, but 12 K is way below 285 K. So perhaps the data is from 12 K upwards, and the T³ law applies for T <12 K. Thus:

S = integral from 0 to 12 K (C_v(T) / T) dT + integral from 12 K to 298 K (C_p(T) / T) dT.

But wait, the problem says that at low temperatures, C_p and C_v are the same. So maybe in the T³ region, C_p = C_v.

But to compute the entropy, I need to know the heat capacity in the T³ region. But the problem doesn't provide data for T <12 K. So perhaps, alternatively, they provide the C_p values starting at 12 K, and below that, we use the T³ law.

Wait, but the T³ law relates C_v to T. The Debye model says that at low temperatures, C_v is proportional to T³. So for T < 12 K, C_v = a*T³, where a is a constant.

But without knowing 'a', how can we compute the integral from 0 to 12 K? Unless we can find 'a' from the data provided.

Wait, maybe the data at 12 K gives C_p = 0.392 cal/(K·g-atom). Since the problem says that at low temperatures, C_p = C_v, then at T=12 K, C_v = 0.392 cal/(K·g-atom). But according to the T³ law, C_v should be proportional to T³. So if at T=12 K, C_v = a*(12)^3.

So then a = C_v / (12^3) = 0.392 / (1728) cal/(K^4·g-atom).

Then, the entropy from 0 to 12 K is the integral of C_v/T dT from 0 to12 K.

Since C_v = a*T^3, then C_v/T = a*T^2.

So integral from 0 to12 K: a*T^2 dT = a*(T^3/3) evaluated from 0 to12.

So that's (a * (12)^3)/3 = (a * 1728)/3 = a * 576.

But a is 0.392 /1728, so substituting:

Entropy from 0 to12 K = (0.392 /1728) * 576 = 0.392 * (576/1728) = 0.392 * (1/3) ≈ 0.1307 cal/K·g-atom.

Wait, 576 /1728 is 1/3, so yes.

So the first part contributes approximately 0.1307 cal/(K·g-atom).

Then, the second part is the integral from 12 K to298 K of C_p / T dT.

But wait, the data from 12 K to 298 K is provided, so I can approximate the integral using the given data points.

Looking at the data, the temperatures and C_p values are as follows:

T (K) | C_p (cal/(K·g-atom))
12 | 0.392
14 | 0.592
16 | 0.804
18 | 1.020
20 | 1.240
25 | 1.803
30 | 2.306
35 | 2.760
40 | 3.158
45 | 3.503
50 | 3.803
60 | 4.283
70 | 4.647
80 | 4.920
90 | 5.138
100 | 5.284
110 | 5.413
120 | 5.518
130 | 5.608
140 | 5.684
150 | 5.746
160 | 5.799
170 | 5.884
180 | 5.922
190 | 5.956
200 | 6.018
210 | 6.047
220 | 6.073
230 | 6.096
240 | 6.119
250 | 6.144
260 | 6.171
270 | 6.201
280 | 6.224
298.16 |6.224 (I think the last entry is 298.16 K, 6.224)

Wait, but the last entry is 298.16 K, 6.224. So the data goes from 12 K up to 298.16 K.

To compute the integral from 12 K to 298 K of C_p / T dT, I can use the trapezoidal rule or some other numerical integration method. Since the data points are at varying intervals, I'll have to calculate each segment.

Alternatively, since the problem gives the data, perhaps it's easier to approximate the integral by summing over each temperature interval with the average C_p/T for that interval.

But this could take a while. Let me list all the data points:

From 12 K to 298.16 K, the data is as follows:

12, 0.392

14, 0.592

16,0.804

18,1.020

20,1.240

25,1.803

30,2.306

35,2.760

40,3.158

45,3.503

50,3.803

60,4.283

70,4.647

80,4.920

90,5.138

100,5.284

110,5.413

120,5.518

130,5.608

140,5.684

150,5.746

160,5.799

170,5.884

180,5.922

190,5.956

200,6.018

210,6.047

220,6.073

230,6.096

240,6.119

250,6.144

260,6.171

270,6.201

280,6.224

298.16,6.224

Wait, but the last entry is at 298.16 K, which is 298 K approximately. So the upper limit is 298 K.

So the plan is to compute the integral from 12 K to 298 K by summing each interval's contribution. For each pair of consecutive points, calculate the average C_p/T and multiply by the temperature difference.

Wait, the formula for the trapezoidal rule is: for each interval from T_i to T_{i+1}, the integral is approximately (T_{i+1} - T_i) * (C_p_i/T_i + C_p_{i+1}/T_{i+1}) ) / 2.

Wait, no, because the function is C_p(T)/T, so the integral from T_i to T_{i+1} is the average of (C_p_i/T_i) and (C_p_{i+1}/T_{i+1}) ) multiplied by (T_{i+1} - T_i).

Alternatively, the integral of C_p/T dT from T_i to T_{i+1} can be approximated as the average (C_p_i + C_p_{i+1}) / 2 divided by the average T, multiplied by (T_{i+1} - T_i). Hmm, perhaps not. Maybe it's better to take each subinterval and compute average C_p/T multiplied by delta T.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute for each interval, the contribution as (C_p_i / T_i + C_p_{i+1}/T_{i+1}) ) * (T_{i+1} - T_i) / 2.

So for each pair of points, we'll calculate the average value of C_p/T over that interval, multiplied by the width of the interval.

Let me list all the intervals and calculate each contribution.

1. From 12 to14 K:
C_p1=0.392, T1=12
C_p2=0.592, T2=14
delta_T=2
avg_CpT = (0.392/12 + 0.592/14)/2
Compute 0.392/12 = 0.03267; 0.592/14 ≈0.042286
avg = (0.03267 +0.042286)/2 ≈0.037478
contribution = avg * delta_T = 0.037478 *2 ≈0.074956 cal/(g-atom)

2. 14 to16 K:
C_p1=0.592, T1=14
C_p2=0.804, T2=16
delta_T=2
0.592/14≈0.042286; 0.804/16=0.05025
avg=(0.042286+0.05025)/2≈0.046268
contribution=0.046268 *2≈0.092536

3. 16 to18 K:
C_p1=0.804, T1=16
C_p2=1.020, T2=18
delta_T=2
0.804/
