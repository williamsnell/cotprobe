Question:

A defendant was suspected of having burglarized his neighbor's apartment. The neighbor reported that his apartment had been ransacked and several items of clothing had been stolen. During the course of their investigation, two police detectives went to the defendant's place of work to interview him. After being advised of his Miranda rights, the defendant requested permission to call his attorney. Although his attorney was unavailable, the attorney's receptionist admonished him not to say anything. The defendant told the detectives he would have nothing further to say unless his attorney was present. The detectives then asked him if he would accompany them to the police station to answer some questions about an unrelated robbery. The defendant agreed. As they were driving to the police station, the defendant was asked where he had purchased the boots that he was wearing. He refused to answer. When they arrived at the police station, the detectives requested that he sign a waiver of his right to counsel. The defendant replied that he would not sign anything in the absence of his attorney. He was then placed in an interrogation room. Shortly thereafter, the defendant was told he could leave if he would be willing to say where he had purchased his boots. The defendant admitted that he had bought the boots and some shirts from a friend. From this information, the detectives obtained a search warrant and went to the defendant's home where they found the stolen clothing. The defendant is charged with burglarizing the apartment. At trial, the court should

Options:

A: admit the confession because it was voluntary, and the clothing because it was obtained pursuant to a valid search warrant.
B: suppress the confession because it was obtained in violation of his Fifth Amendment right to counsel, and the clothing because the search warrant was secured as a result of the confession.
C: suppress both the confession and the clothing because the defendant's right to counsel was violated.
D: admit the confession because the defendant voluntarily accompanied the detectives, but suppress the clothing because the search warrant was based on the confession.
E: suppress the confession because the defendant failed to sign the waiver, but admit the clothing because it was obtained pursuant to a valid search warrant.
F: admit the confession because the defendant was not under arrest when he made it, and the clothing because it was obtained pursuant to a valid search warrant.
G: admit the confession because the question about the boots was about an unrelated robbery, but suppress the clothing because the search warrant was based on the confession.
H: suppress the confession because the defendant's attorney was not present, and the clothing because it was obtained pursuant to a valid search warrant.
I: suppress the confession because the detectives continued questioning after the defendant invoked his right to counsel, but admit the clothing because it was obtained pursuant to a valid search warrant.
J: suppress the confession because it was obtained in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel, but admit the clothing because it was obtained pursuant to a valid search warrant.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this law question. Let's break it down step by step. The question is about whether certain evidence should be admitted or suppressed in a criminal trial. The defendant is charged with burglary, and there are some issues with his Miranda rights and the right to counsel.

First, let me recall the relevant legal concepts. The Fifth Amendment protects against self-incrimination and requires that Miranda warnings be given. The Sixth Amendment provides the right to an attorney during custodial interrogation. Once a suspect invokes their right to an attorney, the police must stop questioning until the attorney is present.

In this case, the defendant was at work when two detectives came to interview him. He was read his Miranda rights and then asked to call his attorney, but the attorney wasn't available. The receptionist told him not to say anything, and he told the detectives he wouldn't speak without his attorney. So he invoked his right to counsel.

Then, the detectives asked him to go to the police station for an unrelated robbery. He agreed. On the way, they asked about his boots, but he refused to answer. At the station, they asked him to sign a waiver of his right to counsel, but he refused again. He was placed in an interrogation room. Later, they told him he could leave if he told where he bought the boots. He admitted buying the boots and shirts from a friend. This info led to a search warrant, and they found stolen clothing at his home.

So, the issues are whether the confession (about the boots and shirts) and the clothing found should be admitted at trial.

The key points here are whether the defendant's statements were obtained in violation of his right to counsel under the Fifth or Sixth Amendment.

I remember that once a suspect invokes the right to counsel, any subsequent interrogation without the attorney present violates Miranda. But there's also the concept of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, which attaches at the initiation of adversary proceedings. I think the Sixth Amendment might come into play if the defendant has been charged or is in a custodial situation.

Wait, but in this case, the defendant was not under arrest when he was first interviewed at work. He agreed to go to the police station voluntarily. So he might not have been in custody initially, but when they placed him in an interrogation room, maybe that changed.

Let me think about when Miranda applies. Miranda applies when a person is in custody and being interrogated. If the defendant was in custody at the police station, then the Miranda rights would be in play. But when he was at work, he wasn't in custody, so the initial Miranda warnings might not have been required unless the questioning was custodial.

Wait, in the scenario, he was advised of his Miranda rights when the detectives came to his workplace. So the police gave him Miranda warnings, but he was at work. Then he invoked his right to counsel. So any further questioning without his attorney would be a violation, regardless of custody, because he had invoked.

Wait, no. I think the rule is that if a suspect is in custody and invokes Miranda, then questioning must stop. But if the suspect is not in custody, maybe the police can reinitiate contact later. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, the key case is Edwards v. Arizona. That case held that once a suspect invokes Miranda, the police cannot reinitiate questioning until counsel is present, whether or not the suspect is in custody. So if the defendant here invoked his right to counsel, the police couldn't question him further unless his attorney was present, regardless of custody.

In this case, the defendant invoked his right to counsel when he said he wouldn't speak without his attorney. Then, the detectives asked him to go to the police station for an unrelated matter. He agreed. So he was going voluntarily. But once at the station, even if he's not under arrest, if they question him, that would be a problem.

But wait, when they were driving, he was asked about the boots and refused. Then at the station, they asked him to sign a waiver, which he refused. Then, later, they offered to let him leave if he answered about the boots. He then made the admission.

So the issue is whether the police can ask him questions after he invoked his right to counsel. According to Edwards, once a suspect invokes Miranda, police cannot initiate further questioning without an attorney, regardless of custody. So any statements made after that would be inadmissible unless the attorney was present.

But here, the defendant was not in custody when he was first questioned at work, but he was later taken to the station. I'm not sure about the custody part. If he was in custody at the station, that complicates things. But the police can't question him after he invoked, regardless.

So the confession about the boots and shirts was obtained after he invoked his right to counsel. Therefore, that statement should be suppressed because it was obtained in violation of his Fifth Amendment right to counsel.

But wait, the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is different. The Sixth Amendment applies once adversary proceedings have begun, like when charges are filed. If the defendant hadn't been charged yet, the Sixth Amendment might not apply. So maybe it's a Fifth Amendment issue, not Sixth.

So the confession would be suppressed under the Fifth Amendment because the police continued questioning after he invoked his right to counsel.

Now, what about the clothing found via the search warrant? The warrant was based on the confession. If the confession was obtained illegally, then the evidence obtained as a result (the clothing) would be considered fruit of the poisonous tree and should also be suppressed.

Wait, but in some cases, if the warrant is based on more than just the illegal evidence, it might still be valid. But here, it seems the warrant was obtained solely based on the defendant's statement. So if the confession is suppressed, the search warrant would be invalid, and the clothing would be inadmissible.

But wait, there's an exception. If the police can show that they would have discovered the evidence anyway through a source independent of the illegal conduct, then the evidence is admissible. But in this case, I don't think there's any indication of that. So the clothing would be suppressed as well.

Now looking at the options:

Option B: Suppress confession because Fifth Amendment, and clothing because warrant based on confession. So B says both are suppressed.

Option J: Suppress confession under Sixth Amendment, but admit clothing because warrant valid. Wait, but I thought it's a Fifth Amendment issue, not Sixth. So J might not be correct.

Option I: Suppress confession because detectives continued after Miranda invocation, but admit clothing because warrant valid. Hmm, no, because the warrant was based on the confession, which was illegal. So the clothing should also be suppressed.

Option C: Both suppressed because right to counsel violated. But I think it's Fifth Amendment, not Sixth, so C says both are suppressed, but maybe the reasoning is incorrect.

Wait, wait. Let's think again. The defendant invoked his right to counsel under Miranda (Fifth Amendment), so any subsequent questioning without counsel is a violation. Therefore, the confession is inadmissible. The clothing, obtained via a warrant based on that confession, is also inadmissible as fruit of the poisonous tree.

So the correct option would be B: suppress both because the confession was obtained in violation of Fifth Amendment right to counsel, and the clothing because the warrant was based on that confession.

But let me check the options again.

Option B says: "suppress the confession because it was obtained in violation of his Fifth Amendment right to counsel, and the clothing because the search warrant was secured as a result of the confession."

Yes, that fits.

Alternatively, option J says it's a Sixth Amendment violation. But I don't think the Sixth Amendment applies here because the defendant hadn't been charged yet. So it's a Fifth Amendment issue, not Sixth.

So the correct answer should be B.

The question revolves around whether the defendant's confession and the evidence obtained from a search warrant should be admitted or suppressed at trial. The defendant invoked his right to counsel under the Fifth Amendment when he stated he would not speak without his attorney. Despite this, the detectives continued to question him, which violates the principles established in *Edwards v. Arizona*. This case held that once a suspect invokes their Miranda rights, police cannot reinitiate questioning unless the suspect's attorney is present, regardless of whether the suspect is in custody.

The defendant's subsequent confession about purchasing the boots and shirts was obtained in violation of his Fifth Amendment right to counsel. As a result, the confession is inadmissible. Furthermore, the search warrant was based solely on this illegally obtained confession, making the evidence found (the stolen clothing) "fruit of the poisonous tree." Under the exclusionary rule, this evidence must also be suppressed because it was derived from an unconstitutional source.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option B** correctly states that the confession should be suppressed due to a violation of the Fifth Amendment right to counsel and that the clothing should also be suppressed because the search warrant was based on the illegal confession.
- **Option J** incorrectly attributes the issue to the Sixth Amendment, which is not applicable here because the defendant had not yet been charged, and the Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches only after the initiation of adversary proceedings.
- Other options either fail to address the Fifth Amendment violation or incorrectly admit evidence that should be suppressed.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**B: suppress the confession because it was obtained in violation of his Fifth Amendment right to counsel, and the clothing because the search warrant was secured as a result of the confession.**

Answer: B
