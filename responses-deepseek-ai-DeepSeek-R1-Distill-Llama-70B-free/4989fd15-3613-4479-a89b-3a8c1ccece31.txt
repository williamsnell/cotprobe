Question:

A six-sided die (whose faces are numbered 1 through 6, as usual) is known to be counterfeit: The probability of rolling any even number is twice the probability of rolling any odd number. What is the probability that if this die is thrown twice, the first roll will be a 5 and the second roll will be a 6?

Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what the question is asking. 

The problem is about a counterfeit six-sided die. Normally, each face (1 through 6) has an equal chance, but this one is different. The probability of rolling an even number is twice that of rolling an odd number. So I need to calculate the probability of getting a 5 on the first roll and a 6 on the second roll when this die is thrown twice.

Hmm, okay. So first, let's understand the die's probabilities. A standard die has six faces, numbers 1 to 6. The even numbers are 2, 4, 6, and the odd are 1, 3, 5. So, three evens and three odds.

But in this counterfeit die, the probability of each even number is twice that of each odd. So I need to assign probabilities such that each even has probability 'e' and each odd has probability 'o', with e = 2o.

Since the total probability must sum to 1, let's set up the equation. There are 3 odd numbers and 3 even. So 3o + 3e = 1. But since e = 2o, substituting gives 3o + 3*(2o) = 1. That's 3o +6o = 9o =1 â†’ o =1/9. Therefore, each odd number has a 1/9 chance, and each even has 2/9.

Wait, let me check that. 3*(1/9) for odds is 3/9 =1/3. 3*(2/9) for evens is 6/9=2/3. Yep, that adds up to 1. So each odd number (like 1,3,5) has 1/9 probability, and each even (2,4,6) has 2/9 each.

Now the question asks for the probability that the first roll is a 5 and the second is a 6. Since the die rolls are independent, the combined probability is the product of the individual probabilities.

So first roll is 5: 5 is odd, so probability is 1/9.

Second roll is 6: 6 is even, so probability is 2/9.

Multiply them: (1/9) * (2/9) = 2 / 81.

Looking at the options, option B is 2/81, which matches. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, another way to think: P(5) is 1/9, P(6)=2/9. So together, 1/9 * 2/9 = 2/81. Yep, that's right. So the answer should be B.

The problem involves a counterfeit six-sided die where the probability of rolling an even number is twice that of rolling an odd number. To determine the probability of rolling a 5 first and a 6 second, we first calculate the probabilities for each face. 

There are three odd numbers (1, 3, 5) and three even numbers (2, 4, 6). Let the probability of rolling an odd number be \( o \), and the probability of rolling an even number be \( e \). Since \( e = 2o \), the total probability is:

\[
3o + 3e = 1 \implies 3o + 3(2o) = 1 \implies 9o = 1 \implies o = \frac{1}{9}.
\]

Thus, the probability of rolling an odd number is \( \frac{1}{9} \), and the probability of rolling an even number is \( \frac{2}{9} \).

Next, the probability of rolling a 5 (odd) first and a 6 (even) second is the product of the individual probabilities, as the rolls are independent:

\[
P(5 \text{ first and } 6 \text{ second}) = P(5) \cdot P(6) = \frac{1}{9} \cdot \frac{2}{9} = \frac{2}{81}.
\]

From the given options, the correct answer is **B: 2/81**.
