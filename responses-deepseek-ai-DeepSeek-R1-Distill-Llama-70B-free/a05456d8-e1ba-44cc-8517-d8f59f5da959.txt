Question:

B: Disorganized
C: Disoriented
D: Ambivalent
E: Dependent
F: Attachment disorder
G: Fearful avoidant
H: Avoidant
I: Anxious resistant
J: Secure

Okay, so I need to figure out which attachment classification fits this infant's behavior. Let me start by recalling what I know about attachment styles, especially the ones mentioned in the options.

The scenario is: A mother and her infant are alone. A stranger comes in, the mother leaves, and when she returns, the baby cries. Even when picked up, the baby keeps crying at first but eventually settles down and starts playing happily.

Hmm, right. So the key points are the baby's reaction when the mother leaves and returns. I remember that attachment styles are often determined by the Strange Situation test, which involves a similar setup. 

In the Strange Situation, a secure attachment is when the baby is upset when the mother leaves but quickly calms down when she returns. The baby might cry but is easily comforted by the mother's return and then goes back to playing.

Wait, but in this case, the baby continues crying even after being picked up. Does that mean something else? Oh, but the baby does calm down eventually and starts playing happily. So the initial crying upon the mother leaving and the stranger entering is normal. The key difference is whether the baby is comforted when the mother returns.

Let me think about the different classifications:

- Secure (J): The baby is distressed when the mother leaves but quickly comforted upon her return. They might cry but settle down quickly.

- Anxious-Resistant (I): The baby is very upset when the mother leaves and doesn't calm down easily when she returns. They might cling to the mother and not explore.

- Avoidant (H or A maybe): The baby shows little distress when the mother leaves and doesn't seek comfort when she returns. They might even avoid the mother.

- Disorganized (B): The baby's behavior is inconsistent and lacks a clear pattern. They might show confusion or fear upon the mother's return.

In the scenario, the baby starts crying when the mother returns and continues even after being picked up. But then he settles down. So, maybe it's not secure because secure babies usually calm down quickly. Or does "eventually" mean it's still secure?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the details. Let me think again. Secure babies might protest when the mother leaves but when she comes back, they go to her and are comforted. They might be upset but not for long.

In this case, the baby is initially upset and continues crying even after being picked up. But then eventually settles. So perhaps it's not the most secure behavior. Or maybe it's still secure because the baby does calm down and starts playing. The initial crying could be normal, especially if the mother is a stranger for a moment.

Wait, but in the scenario, the mother leaves, a stranger enters, then the mother comes back. The baby starts crying when she returns. So maybe the baby was stressed by the stranger, but upon mother's return, he seeks comfort. It takes some time, but he does settle down.

Alternatively, if the baby continued to be upset even after the mother's return and didn't comfort, that might indicate anxious-resistant. But here, the baby does calm down.

So I think the correct classification is secure. Because the baby does use the mother as a secure base, gets upset when she leaves, and is comforted upon her return, even if it takes a bit longer. The key is that the baby does settle down and returns to playing happily, which shows that the attachment is secure.

Wait, but another thought: if the baby continues crying even after being picked up, maybe it's ambivalent or anxious-resistant. Because in anxious-resistant, the baby is very distressed and has a hard time being comforted. But in this case, the baby does calm down eventually.

I'm a bit confused between secure and ambivalent. Let me try to recall more specific criteria.

Secure: The baby is upset when left alone, but when the mother returns, the baby is easily comforted, may stop crying, maybe even smile and play.

Ambivalent: The baby is very upset when the mother leaves and is hard to comfort upon return. They might cling but also hit or push the mother, showing a mix of anger and neediness.

In the scenario, the baby starts crying when the mother returns and continues even after being picked up, but eventually settles. So maybe it's ambivalent because the baby is resistant to comfort. Or perhaps it's just a securely attached baby who was really upset and took a bit longer to calm down.

Wait, but the baby does calm down and plays happily. So maybe it's secure. Because in ambivalent, the baby doesn't really settle down and might stay upset or act out more.

Another point: the mother leaves, the stranger comes in. When the mother returns, the baby is upset. But the baby is comforted and goes back to playing. So it sounds like secure attachment.

Therefore, I think the answer is Secure, which is option J.

The scenario describes a mother and her infant in a situation involving a stranger and the mother's temporary absence. Upon the mother's return, the infant cries initially but eventually calms down, settles, and returns to playing happily. This behavior aligns with the characteristics of a secure attachment. 

In a secure attachment, the infant is typically distressed when the caregiver leaves but is quickly comforted upon their return. While the infant in this scenario continues crying even after being picked up, the fact that they eventually settle down and resume playing happily suggests that the infant uses the mother as a secure base and is comforted by her presence. This distinguishes it from ambivalent or anxious-resistant attachment, where the infant remains distressed and has difficulty being comforted. Similarly, it does not fit avoidant or disorganized attachment patterns, as the infant does seek comfort and shows a coherent response to the mother's return.

Thus, the most appropriate classification for this infant is **Secure**.
