Okay, so I have this question about AC motors and variable frequency supplies. I'm a bit rusty on my motor knowledge, but let me think through this.

The question is asking why the motor requires variable voltage when operating on variable frequency supplies. The options are from A to J. Hmm.

First, I remember that AC motors, especially induction motors, rely on the interaction between the magnetic fields of the stator and rotor. The speed of the motor is typically determined by the frequency of the supply. So if the frequency changes, the motor's speed changes. But wait, voltage must play a role too.

Oh right, when you change the frequency, you also need to adjust the voltage to maintain a certain condition. I think it's related to the motor's magnetic flux. The flux in the motor is proportional to voltage divided by frequency, right? So flux Î¦ = V / f. If the frequency increases and the voltage isn't adjusted, the flux would drop. That might cause the motor to overheat because the current would increase due to lower impedance or something. 

Wait, but why does the flux matter? Lower flux might reduce the motor's torque. So maybe adjusting the voltage with frequency helps maintain the flux at a level that's optimal for the motor's operation. If the flux is too low, the motor might not develop enough torque, leading to poor performance or even overheating because of increased current.

So the question is about why variable voltage is needed. I think the main reason is to maintain a constant flux, which in turn helps in maintaining the motor's performance. But looking at the options, I'm not sure which one directly relates to that.

Option H says "avoid effect of saturation." Saturation in the motor's iron core could be a problem. If the voltage is too high for a given frequency, the core might saturate, leading to inefficiency and other issues. So maybe adjusting the voltage with frequency helps prevent the core from going into saturation, which would happen if voltage were too high relative to frequency.

Alternatively, option E is about improving torque. If you adjust voltage and frequency, you can control the torque. But I think that's more about controlling the motor's operation rather than the need for variable voltage.

Option I is about protecting insulation. I'm not sure how variable voltage affects insulation. Maybe high voltage spikes could stress the insulation, but the question is about varying the voltage in a controlled way, not spikes.

Option D says maintain constant speed. Wait, no, because when you change the frequency, the speed changes. So variable frequency is used to change speed, so D doesn't seem right.

Option B is about efficiency. I think running at optimal flux levels would help efficiency, but the question is more about the necessity of variable voltage when frequency varies.

Option H again comes to mind. If you don't adjust the voltage when changing the frequency, the flux would change. For example, if you increase the frequency without increasing voltage, flux decreases. Conversely, if you lower the frequency without lowering voltage, flux increases. But too much flux could cause the core to saturate. So by adjusting the voltage proportionally with frequency, you keep the flux at a desired level, avoiding saturation. That makes sense.

Wait, but isn't the initial setup about variable frequency supplies, which are usually used in variable speed drives? So in that case, the voltage is adjusted to keep V/f constant, which maintains the magnetic flux, which in turn affects the motor's characteristics.

So the reason for variable voltage is to avoid the effects of saturation in the motor. So the correct answer would be option H.

When operating on variable frequency supplies, the AC motor requires variable voltage to maintain optimal magnetic flux levels. The flux (\( \Phi \)) in the motor is proportional to the ratio of voltage to frequency (\( \Phi = \frac{V}{f} \)). If the voltage is not adjusted proportionally with frequency changes, the flux would deviate from its optimal level. Excessive flux can lead to core saturation, which reduces efficiency and causes other operational issues. Therefore, adjusting the voltage with frequency helps prevent the effects of saturation, ensuring proper motor performance.

The correct answer is **H**.
