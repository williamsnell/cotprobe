E: C = 4π
F: C = 64π
G: C = 48π
H: C = 12π
I: C = 32π
J: C = 80π

Okay, so I've got this math problem here about a tree trunk, and I'm supposed to find the equation to calculate the distance around it. Let me think through this step by step. 

The question says the tree trunk is circular and has a diameter of 8 feet. I remember that the distance around a circle is called the circumference. So they're asking for the circumference equation.

I recall that the formula for the circumference of a circle is C equals pi times the diameter, or C = πd. Alternatively, it's also 2 times pi times the radius, C = 2πr. Since the problem gives the diameter, using the first formula seems straightforward.

So the diameter d is 8 feet. Plugging that into the formula, that would make C = π * 8, which simplifies to 8π. Let me check the answer options to see which one matches that.

Looking at the options, option C says C =8π. That must be the correct answer. But wait, I should make sure I didn't mix up diameter and radius. Oh right, diameter is twice the radius. So if the diameter is 8, the radius would be 4. Let me double-check using the other formula: C = 2πr. Plugging in r=4, that gives 2*π*4 = 8π. Yep, same result. So I'm confident that option C is correct.

I don't think any other options make sense here. Option A is 16π, which would be if the diameter was 16. Option B is 20π, which is way bigger. Option E is 4π, which is much smaller. So no, option C is definitely the right choice.

The tree trunk has a diameter of 8 feet, and the formula for the circumference (distance around the circle) is \( C = \pi d \). Substituting the diameter \( d = 8 \), the equation becomes \( C = 8\pi \). This matches option C.
