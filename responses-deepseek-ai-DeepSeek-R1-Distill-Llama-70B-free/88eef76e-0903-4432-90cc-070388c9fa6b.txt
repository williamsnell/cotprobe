Okay, so I've got this problem about forced convection in a tube, and I need to calculate three things: the pressure drop, the rate of heat flow, and the heat transfer coefficient. Let's see, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, the problem gives me some parameters. The tube is 1000 feet long, and the wall temperature is 60°F. The air is flowing at 30 ft/s through an area 3 inches across. The bulk temperature of the air is 70°F, and the pressure is 29.4 psia. I need to find the pressure drop, the heat flow rate, and the convection coefficient.

Hmm, starting with the pressure drop. I remember that for fluid flow in pipes, the pressure drop can be calculated using the Darcy-Weisbach equation, which is ΔP = f * (L/D) * (ρ*v²)/2, where f is the friction factor, L is the pipe length, D is the diameter, ρ is the density, and v is the velocity. But wait, I don't have the friction factor here. Oh, wait, maybe it's a smooth pipe and we can assume f is something like 0.02 for turbulent flow, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's more accurate to use the formula for pressure drop in laminar flow, but since the velocity is 30 ft/s, which seems pretty high, maybe it's turbulent. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: maybe using the formula ΔP = (1/2) * f * (L/D) * ρ * v². But I need to know the friction factor f. Oh, but without more info on the pipe's roughness, it's hard to determine. Maybe I should look for another way, perhaps using the formula for pressure drop in terms of dynamic pressure and velocity.

Wait, the problem mentions that the airstream has a certain speed and the tube has a certain diameter. Oh, the diameter is 3 inches. So I can find the Reynolds number to determine if the flow is laminar or turbulent. Reynolds number Re = (v * D) / ν, where ν is the kinematic viscosity. But wait, I need the properties of air at the given conditions.

The air is at 70°F and 29.4 psia. Let me convert that to more usable units. 70°F is about 21.1°C. But for viscosity and density, I think I need to use absolute temperature. 70°F is 294.26 K (since (70+459.67) = 529.67 R, which is 294.26 K). Wait, wait, no: 70°F is 21.11°C, and 0°C is 273.15 K, so 21.11 + 273.15 = 294.26 K.

The pressure is 29.4 psia. Standard atmospheric pressure is about 14.7 psia, so 29.4 is roughly double that. So at 29.4 psia, the air is compressed. I can find the density using the ideal gas law. PV = nRT, so density ρ = (PM)/(RT), where M is molar mass, R is the gas constant.

M for air is about 28.97 g/mol, which is 0.02897 kg/mol. R is 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R). Wait, units can be tricky here. Let me make sure I get them right.

So, P = 29.4 psia, T = 70°F = 529.67 R, R = 10.7316 (psi·ft³)/(lbmol·R). M is 28.97 lbmol? Wait, no, M is per lbmol. So the density ρ = (P * M) / (R * T).

Calculating that: ρ = (29.4 lb/in² * 28.97 lbmol) / (10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R) * 529.67 R). Wait, in² vs ft. Oh right, 1 ft³ is 1728 in³. So I need to convert units properly.

Wait, let's do the calculation step by step. First, let's get all units consistent.

P = 29.4 psia = 29.4 lb/in²

M = 28.97 lbmol (no, wait, M is in lb/lbmol? No, M is molar mass, which is 28.97 g/mol, but in lb units, it's 28.97 lb/lbmol? I think lbmol is the unit, so M is 28.97 lb/lbmol? Not sure, but proceeding.

R is 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R). So putting it all in:

ρ = (29.4 lb/in² * 28.97 lb/lbmol) / (10.7316 psi·ft³/(lbmol·R) * 529.67 R )

Wait, the R in the denominator is in Rankine, so 529.67 R is correct.

Let me compute the numerator and denominator units:

Numerator: lb/in² * lb/lbmol = (lb²)/(in² lbmol).

Denominator: (psi·ft³)/(lbmol·R) * R → (psi·ft³)/(lbmol) because R cancels.

So overall, units of ρ would be (lb²/(in² lbmol)) ) * (lbmol * in²/(lb * ft³)) ) → Hmm, maybe I should just compute the numerical value.

Compute numerator: 29.4 * 28.97 = approx 29.4 * 29 ≈ 852.6 lb·lb/(in² lbmol) → wait, perhaps I'm making this more complicated. Let's compute the value numerically.

So,

Numerator = 29.4 * 28.97 ≈ 29.4 * 29 = 852.6 (exact: 29.4 * 28.97 = 851.05)

Denominator = 10.7316 * 529.67 ≈ 10.7316 * 500 = 5365.8, more precisely:

10.7316 * 529.67 → let's compute 10.7316 * 500 = 5365.8, 10.7316 * 29.67 ≈ 10.7316 * 30 ≈ 321.95, so total ≈ 5365.8 + 321.95 = 5687.75 (exact calculation: 10.7316 * 529.67 ≈ 5687.3 )

So ρ ≈ 851.05 / 5687.3 ≈ 0.15 lb/ft³? Wait, wait, no, because the units would be lb/ft³? Let me think.

Wait, because R is in psi·ft³/(lbmol·R), and P is in psi, so when we multiply P*M, the units become psi * lb/lbmol. Divided by R*T, which is (psi·ft³/(lbmol·R)) * R → the R cancels, so denominator is psi·ft³/lbmol. So overall, ρ would have units (psi lb/lbmol) / (psi ft³/lbmol) ) → (lb)/(ft³) → yes, lb/ft³. So 851.05 / 5687.3 ≈ 0.15 lb/ft³. Wait, but at standard conditions (14.7 psia and 70°F), air density is about 0.076 lb/ft³. Since this is double the pressure, the density should be roughly double, so about 0.15 lb/ft³, which matches our calculation. So ρ ≈ 0.15 lb/ft³.

Wait, but let me check online: at 29.4 psia (which is about 15 psig) and 70°F, air density is approximately 0.15 lb/ft³. So that seems correct.

Now, the diameter D is 3 inches, which is 0.25 feet. The velocity v is 30 ft/s. So the Reynolds number Re = (v * D) / ν.

Wait, ν is the kinematic viscosity. At 70°F, the dynamic viscosity μ for air is about 0.000018 lb/ft·s. Kinematic viscosity ν = μ/ρ. So ν = 0.000018 / 0.15 → 0.00012 ft²/s.

So Re = (30 ft/s * 0.25 ft) / 0.00012 ft²/s → (7.5) / 0.00012 ≈ 62500.

So Re is about 62,500, which is well into the turbulent flow regime (Re > 4000 is generally turbulent). So we can use turbulent flow correlations.

For a smooth tube, the friction factor f can be approximated. For Re=62,500, using the Moody diagram, f is approximately 0.02. Alternatively, using the Colebrook equation or other approximations for turbulent flow in smooth pipes. So I'll take f ≈ 0.02.

So the pressure drop ΔP is given by:

ΔP = f * (L/D) * (ρ v²)/2.

Wait, the formula I recall is ΔP = (f * L * ρ * v²) / (2 * D).

So plugging in the numbers:

f = 0.02,

L = 1000 ft,

D = 0.25 ft,

ρ = 0.15 lb/ft³,

v = 30 ft/s.

So ΔP = (0.02 * 1000 * 0.15 * 30²) / (2 * 0.25).

Let me compute this step by step.

First, numerator: 0.02 * 1000 = 20.

20 * 0.15 = 3.

3 * (30^2) = 3 * 900 = 2700.

Denominator: 2 * 0.25 = 0.5.

So ΔP = 2700 / 0.5 = 5400 lb/in²? Wait, that can't be right, because that's way too high. Wait, wait, no, because the units here might be messed up.

Wait, let's check the units. The formula uses consistent units. Let's see:

f is dimensionless,

L is in ft,

D in ft,

ρ in lb/ft³,

v in ft/s.

So the units for the numerator would be (lb/ft³) * (ft/s)^2 → lb/(ft·s²).

Then, (f * L * ρ * v²) → (ft) * lb/(ft·s²) → lb/(s²).

Wait, no, the formula is (f L ρ v²)/(2 D). So let me see:

f [dimensionless],

L [ft],

ρ [lb/ft³],

v² [ft²/s²],

D [ft].

So f L ρ v² / (2 D) → (ft * lb/ft³ * ft²/s²) / ft → (lb/(ft·s²)) * ft^2/(ft) ) → lb/(s²) * ft → Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. I think I might be making a mistake here. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is written as (f * L * v²) / (2 * D) * ρ.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is:

ΔP (in lb/ft²) = (f * L * ρ * v²) / (2 * D).

But to convert to psi (lb/in²), we need to multiply by the conversion factor. Because 1 ft² = 144 in².

So, 1 lb/ft² = 1/144 lb/in².

So, let's compute the pressure drop in lb/ft² first:

Numerator: f * L * ρ * v² = 0.02 * 1000 ft * 0.15 lb/ft³ * (30 ft/s)^2.

So 0.02 * 1000 = 20.

20 * 0.15 = 3.

3 * 900 (since 30²=900) = 2700.

Denominator: 2 * D = 2 * 0.25 ft = 0.5 ft.

So ΔP (lb/ft²) = 2700 / 0.5 = 5400 lb/ft².

Convert to psi: 5400 lb/ft² * (1 ft² / 144 in²) → 5400 / 144 ≈ 37.5 psi.

Wait, that's a huge pressure drop of 37.5 psi over 1000 ft. That seems way too high. Did I mess up the formula somewhere?

Wait, maybe I should double-check the formula. The correct formula for pressure drop in pipes is ΔP = (f * L * ρ * v²) / (2 * D), but I think I might have missed a factor somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula in terms of dynamic pressure. Or maybe I should consider the units more carefully.

Wait, another approach: using the formula ΔP = (1/2) * f * ρ * v² * (L/D). Let's try that.

So, (1/2) * 0.02 * 0.15 lb/ft³ * (30 ft/s)^2 * (1000 ft / 0.25 ft).

Compute each part:

(1/2) * 0.02 = 0.01.

0.01 * 0.15 = 0.0015.

v² = 900.

L/D = 1000 / 0.25 = 4000.

So, 0.0015 * 900 = 1.35.

1.35 * 4000 = 5400 lb/(ft·s²).

Wait, but that's the same as before. And then to get lb/in², divide by 144 in²/ft². So 5400 / 144 = 37.5 psi.

But that's a huge pressure drop. None of the answer options are anywhere near that. The options for part (a) are all less than 2 psi. So I must have made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong formula. Maybe it's ΔP = (f * ρ * v^2 * L) / (2 * D). That's the same as what I did. Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered that the velocity is given in ft/s but the tube diameter is in inches, so unit conversion might have gone wrong.

Wait, D is 3 inches, which is 0.25 feet. So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula uses the hydraulic diameter, but that's the same as D here.

Wait, maybe the problem is that I'm using lb/ft³ for density, but the formula expects kg/m³ or something else. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a different set of units, like using psi, feet, and seconds, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula ΔP = (0.5 * f * L * ρ * v²) / (D * 1000), but that doesn't seem right. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should check the units again. Let's see:

f is dimensionless.

L is in ft.

ρ is in lb/ft³.

v is in ft/s.

D is in ft.

So, the units for f * L * ρ * v² / D: (ft) * (lb/ft³) * (ft²/s²) / ft → (ft * lb * ft²) / (ft³ * s² * ft) ) → (lb * ft²) / (ft^4 * s²) → lb/(ft² s²).

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a factor. Oh wait, maybe the formula is:

ΔP = (f * L * ρ * v²) / (2 * D * g_c), where g_c is the gravitational conversion factor. Because sometimes in English units, the formula includes 32.174 lb·ft/(lbf·s²).

So, the correct formula considering units would be:

ΔP (lb/in²) = (f * L * ρ * v²) / (2 * D * 32.174) * (1/144).

Wait, let me think again. The standard formula in English units for pressure drop is:

ΔP = (f * L * ρ * v²) / (2 * D * 32.174) * (144 in²/ft²).

Wait, perhaps I should include the conversion factors properly.

Let me try to rederive the formula.

The Darcy-Weisbach equation is:

h_f = f * (L/D) * (v² / 2g),

where h_f is the head loss in feet of fluid.

Then, ΔP = h_f * ρ * g.

But in English units, g is 32.174 ft/s².

So, ΔP = (f * L/D * v²/(2g)) * ρ * g → the g cancels out.

So, ΔP = (f * L * ρ * v²) / (2 D).

But wait, this gives ΔP in lb/ft², because ρ is in lb/ft³, v in ft/s, L and D in ft.

So, to convert lb/ft² to psi (lb/in²), we multiply by 144 in²/ft².

So ΔP (psi) = (f * L * ρ * v²) / (2 D) * 144.

Wait, no. Because 1 ft² = 144 in², so 1 lb/ft² = 1/144 lb/in².

So, if the initial calculation gives ΔP in lb/ft², then to get psi, we divide by 144.

Wait, let me re-express:

h_f (in ft of fluid) = (f * L/D * v²) / (2g).

Then, ΔP = h_f * ρ * g.

So, putting it all together:

ΔP = (f * L/D * v² / (2g)) * ρ * g.

The g cancels, leaving ΔP = (f * L * ρ * v²) / (2 D).

But the units are:

f is dimensionless,

L in ft,

ρ in lb/ft³,

v in ft/s,

D in ft.

So, the numerator is (f) * ft * lb/ft³ * (ft/s)^2.

Which is ft * (lb/ft³) * ft²/s² → (lb * ft^2) / (ft^3 * s^2) ) → lb/(ft * s^2).
