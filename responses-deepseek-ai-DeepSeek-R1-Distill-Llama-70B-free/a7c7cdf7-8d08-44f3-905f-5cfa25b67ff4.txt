Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to find the mean, median, and mode of a series of numbers. The numbers given are: 500, 600, 800, 800, 900, 900, 900, 900, 900, 1000, 1100. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, the mean. Mean is the average, right? So I need to add all these numbers together and then divide by how many there are. Let me count them. There are 11 numbers in total.

Let me add them up. Let's see:

500 + 600 is 1100. Then, adding 800 makes it 1900. Another 800 brings it to 2700. Now, the 900s: there are five of them. So 900 *5 is 4500. Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, I think I messed that up. Because after the two 800s, the next number is 900, but how many 900s are there? Let me recount the list.

Looking back: 500, 600, 800, 800, 900, 900, 900, 900, 900, 1000, 1100. So that's two 800s, five 900s, and then 1000 and 1100.

So let me add them again more carefully.

500 + 600 = 1100.

Then, two 800s: 800 *2 = 1600. So 1100 + 1600 = 2700.

Now the five 900s: 900 *5 = 4500. So adding that to 2700 gives 7200.

Then 1000: 7200 +1000 = 8200.

And 1100: 8200 +1100 = 9300.

So total sum is 9300. Now, there are 11 numbers, so mean is 9300 /11. Let me compute that. 9300 divided by 11. Hmm, 11 times 845 is 9295 because 11*800=8800, 11*45=495. So 8800+495=9295. So 9300-9295 is 5, so it's 845 and 5/11. So approximately 845.45. So the mean is 845.45.

Next, the median. The median is the middle number when the data is ordered, which it already is. Since there are 11 numbers, the median is the 6th number. Let me count: 1:500, 2:600, 3:800, 4:800,5:900, 6:900. So the median is 900.

Then, the mode is the number that appears most frequently. Looking at the list: 500 once, 600 once, 800 twice, 900 five times, 1000 once, 1100 once. So 900 appears the most, five times. So mode is 900.

Now, looking at the options:

Option B says Mean:845.45, Median:900, Mode:900. That matches what I calculated.

Option C has the same mean and median, but mode 1000, which is wrong. Option B is correct.

So the correct answer should be option B.

The mean is calculated by summing all the numbers and dividing by the count. The sum is 9300, and there are 11 numbers, so the mean is 9300/11 = 845.45. The median is the middle number in the ordered list, which is the 6th number (900). The mode is the number that appears most frequently, which is 900 (appearing five times). 

The correct option is B: Mean: 845.45, Median: 900, Mode: 900.

B
