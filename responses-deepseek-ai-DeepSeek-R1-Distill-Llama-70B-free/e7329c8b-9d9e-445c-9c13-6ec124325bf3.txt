Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about amino acids and carbohydrates. The question is asking which feature amino acids have that carbohydrates don't. The options are A to D, each listing a different type of atom.

Hmm, I remember that amino acids are the building blocks of proteins. Each amino acid has an amino group and a carboxyl group attached to a central carbon. Carbohydrates, on the other hand, are made up of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Like sugars and starches.

Wait, so let me think about the components. Carbohydrates typically have the formula Cx(H2O)y, so they're mostly C, H, and O. Amino acids, though, have C, H, O, and also N because of the amino group (NH2). So the key difference is the presence of nitrogen.

Looking at the options: option C is nitrogen atoms. So that's the feature amino acids have that carbs don't. The other options, A (carbon), B (oxygen), and D (hydrogen) are all present in both, so they can't be the right answer.

Wait a second, could there be any exceptions? Like, are there any amino acids without nitrogen? No, I don't think so. Every amino acid must have at least one amino group, which contains nitrogen. Carbs never have nitrogen, right? So yeah, option C is correct.

The question asks which feature amino acids have that carbohydrates do not. Amino acids are characterized by the presence of an amino group (NH₂), which contains nitrogen, whereas carbohydrates are composed primarily of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen (e.g., sugars with the formula Cₓ(H₂O)ᵧ). Among the options:

- **A: Carbon atoms** — Both amino acids and carbohydrates contain carbon.  
- **B: Oxygen atoms** — Both contain oxygen.  
- **C: Nitrogen atoms** — Amino acids have nitrogen due to the amino group, while carbohydrates do not.  
- **D: Hydrogen atoms** — Both contain hydrogen.  

The key distinction is the presence of nitrogen in amino acids, which is absent in carbohydrates. Therefore, the correct answer is **C: nitrogen atoms**.
