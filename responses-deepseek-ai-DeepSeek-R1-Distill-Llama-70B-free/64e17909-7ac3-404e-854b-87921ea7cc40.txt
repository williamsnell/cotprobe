Okay, so I need to figure out LeroiWilson's gross revenue for the week. He sells belts and gets $2.80 for each one. The problem gives me how many belts he made each day over six days. I think I should start by adding up all the belts he made each day and then multiply that total by the price per belt.

Let me list the numbers again to make sure I have them right. Monday is 56 belts, Tuesday is 126, Wednesday 130, Thursday 110, Friday 118, and Saturday 56. Hmm. Let me add them up step by step.

So starting with Monday: 56. Then Tuesday: 56 + 126 is... wait, 56 + 126 would be 182? Wait no, wait, that's not right. Wait, wait, wait. 56 plus 126: 50+120 is 170, and 6+6 is 12, so 182. Yeah, that's correct.

Next, Wednesday is 130. So 182 plus 130. Let's see, 182 + 100 is 282, plus 30 is 312. So total after Wednesday is 312.

Thursday's 110. Adding that to 312: 312 + 100 is 412, plus 10 is 422. So Thursday's total is 422.

Then Friday: 118. So 422 + 118. Let's break it down. 422 + 100 is 522, plus 18 is 540. So after Friday, the total is 540 belts.

Saturday is another 56. So 540 + 56. Let me see, 540 + 50 is 590, plus 6 is 596. So the total belts made during the week are 596.

Wait, wait, did I add that right? Let me check again. Let me add each day one by one:

Monday:56
Tuesday:126 → 56+126=182
Wednesday:130 → 182+130=312
Thursday:110 → 312+110=422
Friday:118 → 422+118=540
Saturday:56 →540+56=596. Yes, that's correct.

Now, each belt gives him $2.80. So the total revenue is 596 belts multiplied by $2.80 per belt.

Hmm, let's calculate that. 596 * 2.80.

I can break this down. 596 * 2 = 1192. And 596 * 0.80 is... let's see, 596 * 0.8. Well, 596 * 0.8 is the same as (596 * 8) /10. 596 *8: 500*8=4000, 96*8=768, so 4000+768=4768. Divided by 10 is 476.8.

So adding 1192 and 476.8 together: 1192 + 400 is 1592, then +76.8 is 1668.8. So $1,668.80.

Now, looking at the options, option E is $1,668.80. So the answer should be E.

Wait, let me double-check my multiplication to be sure. Alternatively, maybe I can compute 596 * 2.80 in another way.

Another approach: 2.80 is equal to 2 + 0.8. So 596 *2 is 1192, and 596 *0.8 is 476.8. Adding them gives 1668.8, which is $1,668.80. Yep, same result. So that's correct.

To calculate LeroiWilson's gross revenue for the week, we first determine the total number of belts he produced by summing the belts made each day:

- Monday: 56 belts  
- Tuesday: 126 belts  
- Wednesday: 130 belts  
- Thursday: 110 belts  
- Friday: 118 belts  
- Saturday: 56 belts  

Adding these together:  
\[
56 + 126 + 130 + 110 + 118 + 56 = 596 \text{ belts}
\]

Next, we calculate the gross revenue by multiplying the total number of belts by the price per belt (\$2.80):  
\[
596 \times 2.80 = 1,668.80
\]

Thus, LeroiWilson's gross revenue for the week is **\$1,668.80**, which corresponds to option **E**.
