Okay, I've got this multiple-choice question about education and intelligence theories. Let me try to figure it out step by step. So, the question is asking what some contemporary intelligence researchers, specifically Howard Gardner and Robert Sternberg, are complaining that schools focus too much on. The options are from A to J.

First, I remember that Howard Gardner is known for his theory of multiple intelligences. He proposed that people have different types of intelligences, not just the traditional IQ. So, he argues that schools often focus too narrowly on certain subjects, like math and reading, which relate to linguistic and logical-mathematical intelligences, but ignore others like musical, bodily-kinesthetic, or interpersonal intelligences.

Then there's Robert Sternberg, who developed the triarchic theory of intelligence. He talks about three components: analytical, practical, and creative. He's critical of education systems that prioritize analytical skills, which are measured by standardized tests, over creative and practical ones. So, schools might be focusing too much on rote learning and test-taking skills rather than fostering creativity or real-world application.

The question is about what schools focus too much on, according to these researchers. So, looking at the options, I need to find which one aligns with their critiques.

Option A says nonessential subjects like art and music. Wait, but Gardner would argue that art and music are actually important because they're part of his multiple intelligences. So if schools are focusing too much on them, that doesn't fit. Or wait, no, the question is what they complain about schools focusing too much on. Wait, the question says "complain that schools focus too much on," so the correct answer is what the schools are focusing on, which Gardner and Sternberg think is wrong.

Option C is traditional subjects and methods. That makes sense because Gardner and Sternberg both argue against the traditional education system. Gardner says schools focus too much on traditional academic subjects, neglecting other intelligences. Sternberg says schools focus too much on analytical (traditional) methods, ignoring creative and practical.

Option E is cultivating social intelligence. Wait, social intelligence is part of Gardner's theory, but I don't think he's complaining that schools focus too much on it. Maybe the opposite, that they don't focus enough on it.

Option F is emotional intelligence. That's more Daniel Goleman's work, not directly related to Gardner or Sternberg's main points here.

Option H is encouraging creative thought. No, Sternberg would say schools don't encourage it enough, so that's not what they're complaining about.

Option C seems to fit because both Gardner and Sternberg are critical of traditional education systems that stick to conventional subjects and teaching methods. So the answer should be C.

The correct answer is C. Gardner and Sternberg critique schools for focusing too much on traditional subjects and methods, which neglect other intelligences and creative thinking.

C
