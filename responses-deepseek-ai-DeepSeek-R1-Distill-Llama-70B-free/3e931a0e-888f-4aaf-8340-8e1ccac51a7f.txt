Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question here about a survey or study from 2018 regarding US adults' opinions on whether computer programs will always reflect human bias. The options are from A to J, each with different percentages. I need to figure out which one is the correct answer.

Hmm, I remember that around 2018, there was a lot of discussion about bias in AI and machine learning. I think the Pew Research Center did a study on this topic. Let me try to recall the specifics. I believe the question was something like whether people think algorithms can make unbiased decisions or if they reflect the biases of their creators.

Wait, I think the exact question was about whether computer programs can make decisions based solely on data without reflecting human biases. Or maybe it was the oppositeâ€”whether they always reflect human bias. Oh right, the question here is phrased as "will always reflect human bias." So the survey probably asked if people agree that computer programs are always biased because they're created by humans.

From what I remember, a significant majority of people agreed with that statement. I think the percentage was in the high 70s or maybe around 80%. Let me think about the options again. The options are A:25%, B:73%, C:58%, D:66%, E:88%, F:90%, G:48%, H:43%, I:33%, J:78%.

So the options in the higher ranges are E (88%), F (90%), B (73%), J (78%). I think the percentage was around 73% or 78%. Now, I'm trying to recall if it was exactly 73% or 78%. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact number, but I think it was one of those.

Wait, I think the study found that about 58% of adults said that computer programs can make decisions without human bias, but that was the opposite. Or was it? No, wait, that was another question. Let me clarify. The question here is about whether programs "always" reflect human bias. So the majority would be those who think bias is always present.

I remember reading that a majority believed that algorithms reflect the biases of their creators. So if 58% said they can make unbiased decisions, then the remaining percentage would think they do reflect bias. Wait, no, that's conflicting. Alternatively, maybe the question was whether people think it's possible for algorithms to be unbiased, and a certain percentage said no, they always reflect bias.

Alternatively, I might have the exact figures mixed up. Let me try to reconstruct. If the question was whether people think that computer programs reflect human bias, the answer was a significant majority. I think it was around 72% or 73%. Looking at the options, B is 73% and J is 78%. I'm not exactly sure which one it was.

Wait, another angle: I think the exact figure from Pew Research in 2018 was 72% of adults saying that computer programs reflect the biases of the people who create them. But I don't see 72% as an option. The closest is B:73% or maybe it's rounded up to 73%.

Alternatively, I might be confusing it with another survey. Let me think again. Maybe it was 58% who thought that algorithms can sometimes reflect bias, and higher for always. No, that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the question was whether they "sometimes" reflect bias, in which case the percentage would be higher. But the question here is about "always" reflecting bias.

Wait, another possibility: I think the exact figure was 58% who said that computer programs can make decisions without human bias. So that would mean the remaining 42% think they do reflect bias. But that's not matching the high options given. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question was phrased differently. Maybe it was whether people think it's possible for AI to make decisions without bias, and the majority said no. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, I think the correct answer is B:73%. I remember that 73% of US adults believed that computer programs reflect human bias. So the answer would be B.

The question asks about the percentage of US adults in 2018 who believed that computer programs will always reflect human bias. Based on the analysis, the correct answer is B:73%, as this aligns with findings from a Pew Research Center study around that time, which indicated that a significant majority held this view.

Answer: B
