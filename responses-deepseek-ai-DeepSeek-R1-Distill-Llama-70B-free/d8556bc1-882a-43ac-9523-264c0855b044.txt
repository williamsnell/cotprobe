Question:

During spring break, a private boarding school was deserted while students and teachers were away on vacation. A guidance counselor remained on campus because he was working on a research project. After working late one night, the counselor decided to enter the room of a student from a very wealthy family. The counselor was rummaging through the student's room looking for something valuable to steal. Under the bed, he noticed an expensive suitcase. The counselor opened the suitcase and found an express mail envelope. The counselor knew that the student's father often sent money to his son in express mail envelopes. The counselor opened the envelope and saw that it contained a large quantity of white powder, which he suspected to be heroin. The counselor telephoned the police, and an officer was dispatched to the school. The counselor handed the officer the envelope, which he transported to the police station. At the station house, the officer opened the envelope and sent a sampling of the substance to the police lab. Tests confirmed the substance to be heroin. The police did not secure a search warrant before confiscating and opening the envelope. The student was thereafter arrested and charged with unlawful possession of a controlled dangerous substance. The student's attorney has filed a motion to suppress the heroin from evidence. The motion will most likely be

Options:

A: granted, because the police should have secured a warrant before seizing the envelope.
B: denied, because the counselor, as a school employee, was in loco parentis.
C: granted, because the police did not have probable cause to test the substance.
D: granted, because the police should have secured a warrant before opening the envelope.
E: granted, because the student was not present during the search.
F: granted, because the student's room is considered private property.
G: denied, because the search was conducted by a private party.
H: denied, because the discovery of the substance was incidental to the counselor's actions.
I: denied, because the school has a policy allowing searches of student rooms.
J: denied, because the counselor had a reasonable suspicion of illegal activity.

Okay, so I have this legal question about a student's room being searched and evidence being found, and the student is trying to get that evidence suppressed. I'm a bit rusty on my Fourth Amendment stuff, but let's try to think this through.

The scenario is that during spring break, a guidance counselor is working late. He decides to enter a student's room, looking for something valuable to steal. He finds an expensive suitcase under the bed, opens it, and finds an express mail envelope. He knows the student's father sends money this way, so he opens the envelope and finds a white powder he thinks is heroin. He calls the police, who come and take the envelope to the station. They open it, test it, and confirm it's heroin. No warrant was obtained.

The student's attorney is trying to suppress the evidence. The question is whether the motion will be granted or denied.

So, first, I remember that the Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures. But when a private citizen conducts a search, the Fourth Amendment doesn't apply because it's not a government actor. So if the counselor, who is a school employee, did the search, does that count as a government action?

Wait, the counselor is a school employee, but he was acting on his own, right? He was looking to steal something. So his actions might not be considered as acting under the authority of the school or the government. But I'm not entirely sure. There's the concept of state actors—people who are acting on behalf of the government. If the counselor was just trespassing and stealing, he's acting as a private individual, not as a state actor. So if he finds something illegal and turns it over to the police, the police didn't conduct an unconstitutional search because it was a private search.

In that case, the evidence might be admissible because the police didn't violate the Fourth Amendment. They didn't search the room or the envelope themselves without a warrant; they just took what the counselor gave them.

Looking at the options, option G says the motion is denied because the search was conducted by a private party. That seems plausible because the counselor was acting privately, so his search doesn't implicate the Fourth Amendment.

But wait, another angle: the counselor is a school employee. Could he be considered a state actor even if he's acting outside his duties? If he was in a position of authority, like a teacher or administrator, and he's searching a student's room, maybe that's a different situation. However, in this case, he wasn't acting in his role as a counselor but was instead trying to steal. So it's more like a private individual's trespassing and theft.

Alternatively, if the school had a policy allowing counselors to search rooms, maybe that's relevant. But the question doesn't mention any such policy. So the search was illegal under school policy, but that's not the issue here—it's about the Fourth Amendment.

So the key point is whether the counselor's actions were those of a private individual or a state actor. If private, then the police can use the evidence without a warrant because the exclusionary rule applies only to government conduct.

Therefore, the motion to suppress would be denied because the search was conducted by a private party. So the correct answer would be option G.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about the in loco parentis doctrine. Option B says the counselor was in loco parentis. In loco parentis allows school officials to search without warrants in certain situations, like searching a student's locker. But in this case, the counselor wasn't acting in his official capacity; he was acting for personal gain. So the in loco parentis doctrine wouldn't apply here because he wasn't carrying out school business.

So option B is probably not the right answer. The correct reasoning is that the counselor was a private individual, so the Fourth Amendment doesn't apply.

Another option, option G: denied because the search was by a private party. Yes, that makes sense.

So the answer should be G.

The motion to suppress the evidence will most likely be denied because the search was conducted by a private party. The guidance counselor, although a school employee, was acting outside his official duties and for personal gain when he entered the student's room and found the envelope. Since the counselor was not acting as a state actor or in loco parentis, his actions do not implicate the Fourth Amendment. The police, therefore, did not need a warrant to seize and test the evidence provided by the counselor. 

The correct answer is:

G
