Okay, so I've got this differential equation problem about finding the homogeneous solution for the voltage across a capacitor in an RLC circuit. Hmm, I remember that in RLC circuits, the behavior can be overdamped, underdamped, or critically damped, depending on the values of R, L, and C.

The problem gives me R=4Ω, L=4H, and the capacitor is (1/2)F. Oh right, the homogeneous solution is the natural response without any external inputs, so it's the transient part that dies out over time.

Wait, I think the first step is to find the characteristic equation for the circuit. The characteristic equation for a series RLC circuit is usually of the form Ls² + Rs + (1/C) = 0. Let me write that down: 4s² + 4s + 2 = 0? Wait, no, because 1/C is 2 when C is 0.5 F. Oh right, 1/(1/2) is 2. So the equation is 4s² +4s + 2 = 0.

I should simplify that equation. Maybe divide all terms by 2 to make it easier. That gives 2s² + 2s +1 =0. Now I'll compute the discriminant, D = b² -4ac. Here, a=2, b=2, c=1. So D= (2)^2 -4*2*1 =4-8= -4. Oh, the discriminant is negative, which means the roots are complex. So the system is underdamped. Right, underdamped circuits have oscillatory behavior with exponential decay.

The general solution for an underdamped case is e^{-α t} [ (C1 cos(ω t) ) + (C2 sin(ω t)) ] where α is the damping factor and ω is the damped natural frequency.

Wait, the roots of the characteristic equation are s = [-b ± sqrt(D)]/(2a). But since D is negative, sqrt(D)=sqrt(4) i? Wait no, sqrt(-4) is 2i. So s = [ -2 ± 2i ]/(2*2) ). Because a is 2. So s = (-2 ± 2i)/4 → (-1 ± i)/2. So α is the real part, which is 1/2, and the imaginary part is 1/2, which is the ω, the damped frequency.

But wait, the standard form for underdamped is s = -α ± jω. So yeah, here α is 0.5 and ω is 0.5? Wait, because the imaginary part is 1/2. So the solution will be e^(-0.5 t) [ C1 cos(0.5 t) + C2 sin(0.5 t) ].

But wait, the problem is asking specifically for the homogeneous solution for v_C(t). Oh right, in a series RLC circuit, the capacitor voltage is the same as the voltage across the capacitor, which, for the homogeneous solution, will have the same form as the current, I think. Or wait, the capacitor voltage is related to the integral of the current. Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the differential equations.

Wait, the differential equation for v_C(t) comes from the circuit. Let me think: in an RLC series circuit, the voltage across the capacitor is related to the current. The current i(t) is the same through all components. So using Kirchhoff's Voltage Law, the sum of the voltages equals zero. So L di/dt + R i + v_C = 0. Also, the current is the derivative of the capacitor charge, so i = d(q)/dt. And the capacitor voltage is v_C = q/C.

Wait, maybe it's easier to express everything in terms of v_C. Because v_C is twice the charge (since C=0.5 F, so q=C v_C = 0.5 v_C → v_C = 2 q. So di/dt = d^2 q/dt². So substituting into the KVL equation: L (d²q/dt²) + R (dq/dt) + (1/C) q =0 → L d²q/dt² + R dq/dt + (1/C) q =0 → substituting q = 0.5 v_C → L d²(0.5 v_C)/dt² + R d(0.5 v_C)/dt + (1/(0.5)) v_C =0 → 0.5 L v_C'' + 0.5 R v_C' + 2 v_C =0. Multiply through by 2 to eliminate decimals: L v_C'' + R v_C' + 4 v_C =0.

Wait wait, I think I might have messed up the substitution. Let me think again. Since v_C = q/C, and q is the charge on the capacitor. So dq/dt = i(t). So the KVL equation is L di/dt + R i + v_C =0. But v_C is q/C. So q = C v_C, so dq/dt = C dv_C/dt. Therefore, i = C dv_C/dt. So di/dt = C dv_C''/dt². Substituting back into KVL: L (C v_C'') + R (C v_C') + v_C =0 → LC v_C'' + RC v_C' + v_C =0.

So the differential equation is LC v_C'' + RC v_C' + v_C =0. Let's plug in the values. L=4 H, C=0.5 F, R=4Ω. So LC =4 *0.5=2. RC=4 *0.5=2. So the equation becomes 2 v_C'' +2 v_C' +v_C=0.

Wait, that's a second-order linear differential equation. To find the homogeneous solution, I need to find the solution to the equation 2v'' +2v' +v =0. Let me write the characteristic equation: 2r² + 2r +1=0. So r = [-2 ± sqrt(4 - 8)]/(2*2) → [-2 ± sqrt(-4)]/4 → (-2 ± 2i)/4 → (-1 ±i)/2.

So the roots are complex: α = 1/2 and ω =1/2. So the general solution is v_C(t) = e^(-1/2 t) [ C1 cos( (1/2) t ) + C2 sin( (1/2) t ) ].

Now, I need to apply the initial conditions to find C1 and C2. The problem states v_C(0)=0. So at t=0, v_C(0)=e^0 [ C1 *1 + C2 *0 ] → C1=0. So the solution simplifies to v_C(t)= C2 e^(-1/2 t) sin( (1/2) t ).

Wait, but the initial conditions given are v_C(0)=0 and i_L(0)=1/4 A. Hmm, i_L(0) is the current through the inductor at t=0. The current i(t) is C dv_C/dt. At t=0, i(0)= C v_C'(0). Let me compute v_C'(t) from the solution.

v_C(t)= C2 e^(-0.5 t) sin(0.5 t). The derivative v_C'(t) would be C2 [ (-0.5) e^(-0.5 t) sin(0.5 t) + e^(-0.5 t) * 0.5 cos(0.5 t) ].

At t=0, sin(0)=0, cos(0)=1. So v_C'(0) = C2 [ 0 + 0.5 *1 ] = 0.5 C2. Then, since i= C dv_C/dt, i(0)= C * v_C'(0) = 0.5 F * (0.5 C2) )= 0.25 C2. But i_L(0) is given as 1/4 A. So 0.25 C2 = 1/4 → C2 = (1/4) / (1/4) )=1. So v_C(t)= e^(-0.5 t) sin(0.5 t) *1 → e^(-t/2) sin(t/2).

Looking at the options, let's see. The options are all in terms of e to some power multiplied by sin or cos. Let's look:

Option E: e^(-1/2 t) sin(1/2 t) V → yes, that's what I have here.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option E says e^(-1/2) t sin(1/2 t) → yes, that's our solution.

So the correct answer is option E.

To find the homogeneous solution for the voltage \( v_C(t) \) across the capacitor in the given series RLC circuit, we start by analyzing the circuit parameters: \( R = 4 \, \Omega \), \( L = 4 \, \text{H} \), and \( C = 0.5 \, \text{F} \). The homogeneous solution corresponds to the natural response of the circuit, which is governed by the characteristic equation of the system.

The characteristic equation for the voltage across the capacitor is derived from the circuit's differential equation. Using Kirchhoff's Voltage Law and substituting \( v_C = q/C \), the equation becomes:

\[
LC v_C'' + RC v_C' + v_C = 0
\]

Substituting \( L = 4 \, \text{H} \), \( C = 0.5 \, \text{F} \), and \( R = 4 \, \Omega \), we get:

\[
2 v_C'' + 2 v_C' + v_C = 0
\]

The characteristic equation is:

\[
2r^2 + 2r + 1 = 0
\]

Solving for \( r \), we find:

\[
r = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 - 8}}{4} = \frac{-2 \pm 2i}{4} = \frac{-1 \pm i}{2}
\]

The roots are complex: \( \alpha = \frac{1}{2} \) (damping factor) and \( \omega = \frac{1}{2} \) (damped natural frequency). The general solution for \( v_C(t) \) is:

\[
v_C(t) = e^{-\alpha t} \left[ C_1 \cos(\omega t) + C_2 \sin(\omega t) \right]
\]

Substituting \( \alpha = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( \omega = \frac{1}{2} \), we have:

\[
v_C(t) = e^{-\frac{1}{2}t} \left[ C_1 \cos\left(\frac{1}{2}t\right) + C_2 \sin\left(\frac{1}{2}t\right) \right]
\]

Applying the initial conditions:
1. \( v_C(0) = 0 \): At \( t = 0 \), \( v_C(0) = C_1 = 0 \).
2. \( i_L(0) = \frac{1}{4} \, \text{A} \): The current through the inductor is related to the derivative of \( v_C(t) \). From \( v_C(t) = C_2 e^{-\frac{1}{2}t} \sin\left(\frac{1}{2}t\right) \), we compute \( v_C'(t) \) and evaluate it at \( t = 0 \) to find \( C_2 = 1 \).

Thus, the solution simplifies to:

\[
v_C(t) = e^{-\frac{1}{2}t} \sin\left(\frac{1}{2}t\right)
\]

Comparing this with the given options, the correct answer is:

**E: \( e^{-\frac{1}{2}t} \sin\left(\frac{1}{2}t\right) \, \text{V} \)**

Answer: E
