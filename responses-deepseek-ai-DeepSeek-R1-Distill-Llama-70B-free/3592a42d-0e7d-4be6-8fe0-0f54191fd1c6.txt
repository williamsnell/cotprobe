Okay, so I've got this statistics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says that X and Y are random variables. Their means are μx = 32 and μy = 44. Their standard deviations are σx = 5 and σy = 12. And they're independent. I need to find the mean and standard deviation of the random variable X + Y.

Hmm, right. I remember that for the mean of the sum of two variables, it's just the sum of their means. So μx+y should be μx + μy. Let me calculate that. 32 plus 44 is 76. Okay, so the mean is 76. That should narrow down the options.

Looking at the options, A is 72, which is too low. B is 80, too high. C is 76, D is 76, E is 76, G is 76, J is 76. So the options C, D, E, G, J have the right mean. Now I need to find the standard deviation.

Wait, standard deviation of the sum of two independent variables. Oh right, since they're independent, the variance adds up. Variance is the square of the standard deviation. So Var(X+Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y) because independence implies zero covariance.

Var(X) is σx squared, which is 5^2 = 25. Var(Y) is 12^2 = 144. Adding them together, 25 + 144 is 169. The variance of X+Y is 169, so the standard deviation is the square root of 169, which is 13.

So the standard deviation is 13. Now looking at the options again. The mean is 76, standard deviation 13. Let me check the options:

Option E says μ=76, σ=13. So that's E. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait, another thought: wait, is it the standard deviation of X+Y the square root of (σx^2 + σy^2)? Because I remember that when variables are independent, their variances add.

Yes, because Var(X + Y) = Var(X) + Var(Y) + 2Cov(X,Y). But since X and Y are independent, Cov(X,Y)=0. So Var(X+Y) = 25 + 144 = 169. Square root is 13.

So the correct answer should be E: μx+y =76, σ=13.

Wait, but the options list E as 76 and 13. So E is the right choice. But wait, looking back at the options, I might have misread. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: μ=72, σ=12

B: μ=80, σ=15

C: μ=76, σ=8.5

D: μ=76, σ=20

E: μ=76, σ=13

G: μ=76, σ=17

J: μ=76, σ=19

So yes, E is the only one with μ=76 and σ=13.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes I get confused between variance and standard deviation. Let me double-check the math. X has σx=5, so variance 25. Y has σy=12, variance 144. Sum is 169, sqrt is 13. Yep, that's correct.

So the correct answer is E.

To determine the mean and standard deviation of the random variable \( X + Y \), we start by calculating the mean. The mean of the sum of two random variables is the sum of their means:

\[
\mu_{X+Y} = \mu_X + \mu_Y = 32 + 44 = 76
\]

Next, for the standard deviation, we use the fact that \( X \) and \( Y \) are independent. The variance of the sum of two independent random variables is the sum of their variances:

\[
\text{Var}(X+Y) = \text{Var}(X) + \text{Var}(Y)
\]

The variances are calculated as:

\[
\text{Var}(X) = \sigma_X^2 = 5^2 = 25, \quad \text{Var}(Y) = \sigma_Y^2 = 12^2 = 144
\]

Thus:

\[
\text{Var}(X+Y) = 25 + 144 = 169
\]

The standard deviation is the square root of the variance:

\[
\sigma_{X+Y} = \sqrt{169} = 13
\]

Now, comparing these results to the options provided, the correct choice is:

**E: \( \mu_{X+Y} = 76, \sigma_{X+Y} = 13 \)**

Answer: E
