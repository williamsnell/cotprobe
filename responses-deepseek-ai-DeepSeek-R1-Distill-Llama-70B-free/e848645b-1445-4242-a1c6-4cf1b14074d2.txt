Question:

A ten-year-old boy, tested with a paper-and-pencil intelligence test, obtained an IQ score of 130. Two years later, he was tested with an alternate form of the same test. Most likely, the obtained score on the second testing would be

Options:

A: 130, but with a significant decrease in subtest scores
B: more than 130
C: 140, indicating significant intellectual growth
D: 130
E: 130, but with a different pare of subtest scores
F: less than 130
G: 130, but with a significant increase in subtest scores
H: 100, showing a significant drop in intelligence quotient
I: 120, indicating a decrease in intellectual capabilities
J: Unpredictable as the test used was different

Okay, so I have this question about IQ tests and a child's score over time. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is about a ten-year-old boy who took a paper-and-pencil intelligence test and got an IQ score of 130. Then, two years later, he took an alternate form of the same test. The question is asking what his score would most likely be the second time.

First, I need to remember what IQ scores mean. I recall that IQ tests are designed so that the average score is 100, and the standard deviation is typically 15. So, a score of 130 is about 130-100=30 points above average. Since the standard deviation is 15, 130 is two standard deviations above the mean, which would place him in the very superior or highly gifted range.

Now, the important thing here is that IQ tests are designed to measure general cognitive abilities, which are considered to be relatively stable across time, especially after a certain age. I think that for children, their IQ can change as they develop, but once they're a bit older, say past 10-12 years, the scores tend to stabilize more. So, this boy was 10 when he first took the test, and then took it again at 12.

Wait, but the test used the second time was an alternate form. I should remember that alternate forms are designed to be equivalent but different versions of the test. They're used to avoid practice effects, where taking the test once might help you on the second try just because you're familiar with it. So, using an alternate form should account for that. But the question is about the score itself.

So, the key point is test-retest reliability. IQ tests are generally reliable over time, meaning that if you take the test again under similar conditions, you'd get a similar score. But I also remember that for children, especially as they grow, their cognitive abilities develop, which might cause their IQ scores to change. But wait, that's more about the Flynn effect, which is about population increases over generations, not individual changes.

Alternatively, I might be confusing it with the idea that as children grow, their cognitive abilities can change, but once they reach a certain age, the variance in their scores stabilizes. So, for a 10-year-old, taking the test again two years later, the score might stay the same, assuming no significant intervening factors.

Another thing to consider is the concept of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC), which is commonly used for this age group. The WISC has good test-retest reliability, so the scores are consistent across testing occasions. Unless there have been significant life changes, education, or health issues, the IQ score remains relatively stable.

So, if the first test was at age 10 and the second at 12, and assuming the alternate form is equivalent, the IQ score should remain about the same. Therefore, the second score should also be around 130.

Looking at the options:

Option D says 130. Option E says 130 with different subtest scores, but the question doesn't mention anything about subtests, so maybe D is better. Option F suggests a lower score, which doesn't make sense unless there's a reason for decline, which the question doesn't provide. Option B and C suggest higher scores, implying improvement, but unless he's had some kind of intervention, that's not typical. The other options like A, G, H, I, J involve changes or unpredictability, but the correct assumption is that the score remains stable.

So the answer should be D: 130.

The IQ score is a measure of cognitive ability that tends to remain relatively stable over time, especially after early childhood. In this case, the boy was tested at age 10 and again at age 12 using an alternate form of the same test. Alternate forms are designed to be equivalent, minimizing practice effects. Since no significant intervening factors are mentioned, and IQ scores are generally reliable across retesting, the score is likely to remain the same. Therefore, the most plausible answer is that the second score would also be 130.

Answer: D
