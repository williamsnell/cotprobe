Okay, so I have this question here about a psychology experiment. Let me try to think through it. The question is about a class that listened to a list of words. Half the group was told to listen for sounds, and the other half was asked to gauge the emotional impact of the words. The group that focused on emotions remembered more words. The question is about what this says regarding retention and attention.

Hmm, I remember from my psychology classes that there are different levels of processing information. There's something called the levels of processing theory, right? I think it was proposed by Craik and Lockhart. So the idea is that the way information is processed affects how well it's remembered.

In this theory, there are different levelsâ€”like shallow and deep processing. Shallow processing involves processing the surface features of information, like the sound or the physical characteristics. Deep processing, on the other hand, involves semantic processing, where you think about the meaning of the information.

So in the question, one group was focusing on sounds, which would be more of a surface-level task. They're paying attention to the auditory aspects, maybe the phonetics. The other group was looking at the emotional impact, which is about the meaning of the words. Emotional impact is related to semantics because you're connecting the words to feelings or meanings.

The group that focused on emotions remembered more. That makes sense because deeper processing (semantic) leads to better retention. So the key here is that the emotional impact group engaged in deeper processing, which enhanced their memory.

Looking at the options, the question is about what kind of attention leads to better retention. The correct term here is "deep processing." So which option is that? Let me check the options again.

Option J is deep processing, which matches. Other options like surface or shallow processing would be the opposite. The other options like auditory, phonetic, acoustic might relate to the first group's task, but that's not what the experiment's result supports here.

So the answer should be J: deep processing.

The experiment described involves two groups: one focusing on sounds (surface processing) and the other on emotional impact (semantic processing). The group that focused on emotional impact, engaging in deeper processing, remembered more words. According to the levels of processing theory, deep processing, which involves semantic features, leads to better retention. Therefore, the evidence supports that better retention results from deep processing.

Answer: J
