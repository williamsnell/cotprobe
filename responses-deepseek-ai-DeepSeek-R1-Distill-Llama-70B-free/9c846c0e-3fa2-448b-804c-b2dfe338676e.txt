Okay, so I've got this question here about calculating the net cost of a tape recorder after a discount. The list price is $32, and the discount rate is 30%. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think I can figure it out.

Alright, let's break it down. The list price is the original price before any discounts, right? So that's $32. The discount rate is 30%, which means they're taking off 30% of that list price. So I need to find out how much 30% of $32 is and then subtract that from the original price to get the net cost.

Wait, how do I calculate percentages again? Oh right, to find a percentage of a number, you multiply the percentage (in decimal form) by that number. So 30% as a decimal is 0.30. So 0.30 times $32 would be the discount amount.

Let me do that math. 0.30 * 32. Hmm, 0.3 times 30 is 9, and 0.3 times 2 is 0.6, so 9 + 0.6 is $9.60. So the discount is $9.60.

Now, subtract that from the original price. $32 minus $9.60. Let me subtract: 32 minus 9 is 23, and then minus 0.60, so 23 - 0.60 is $22.40. So the net cost should be $22.40.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see option F is $22.40. So that must be the answer. But wait, let me double-check my calculations to be sure.

Another way to approach this is to think about it as taking 70% of the original price because 100% - 30% = 70%. So 70% of $32. 0.70 * 32. Let's see, 0.7 times 30 is 21, and 0.7 times 2 is 1.4, so 21 + 1.4 is $22.40. Yep, same result. So I'm confident now.

I think I might have made a mistake if I forgot to convert the percentage to decimal correctly, but I don't think so here. Also, sometimes people get confused whether to add or subtract, but since it's a discount, you subtract. So yeah, the net cost is $22.40, which is option F.

To determine the net cost of the tape recorder after a 30% discount, we start with the list price of $32. The discount amount is calculated as 30% of $32, which is:

\[
0.30 \times 32 = 9.60
\]

Subtracting the discount from the list price gives:

\[
32 - 9.60 = 22.40
\]

Thus, the net cost of the tape recorder is **$22.40**, which corresponds to option F.
