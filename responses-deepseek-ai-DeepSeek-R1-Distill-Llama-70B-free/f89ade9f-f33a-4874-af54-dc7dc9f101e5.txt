Okay, so I have this question about finance, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking about the capital of a firm given some specific numbers. Let me see what I remember about this.

Alright, the question states that the firm has total assets of $240,000, total liabilities of $100,000, and an income of $40,000 for one year. The options are multiple choice, from A to J, each with different dollar amounts.

Wait, I think I remember something about the accounting equation. It's Assets = Liabilities + Equity, right? So the basic idea is that a company's assets are financed either by liabilities (what they owe) or by equity, which includes the owner's capital. So the capital, or equity, should be assets minus liabilities.

Let me plug in the numbers. Total assets are $240,000, and total liabilities are $100,000. So if I subtract the liabilities from the assets, that should give me the equity, or capital. 240,000 minus 100,000 is 140,000. Hmm, so that would be $140,000.

Wait, but there's also an income of $40,000 for the year. Does that affect the capital? I'm a bit confused here. Because I thought the income would relate to the profit, which might then be added to the capital as retained earnings.

So let me think again. The initial capital (equity) is assets minus liabilities, which is 240k - 100k = 140k. But then, the firm made $40k income over the year. If that income is profit, then it would increase the equity. So the new capital would be 140k +40k = 180k.

Wait, but am I mixing concepts here? Because the question is asking for the capital. Is the capital just the initial equity, or does it include the changes during the year?

Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The question gives the total assets and total liabilities, so the equity is 240k -100k = 140k. So the capital should be 140,000.

Looking back at the options, option F is $140,000. So would that be the correct answer? Or am I missing something about the income?

Wait another thought: in some contexts, capital might refer to the owner's investment, but sometimes it includes retained earnings. So if the firm made a profit of $40k, that would be added to the capital. But the initial capital (owner's equity) would be 140k. But the question is about the capital after the year, perhaps.

Wait, the question doesn't specify whether the $40k income is revenue or net income. Assuming it's net income, which would add to equity. So the capital would be 140k +40k = 180k.

But wait, the question is phrased as "the capital of a firm" with those totals. The income for the year is given, so maybe the capital is the initial amount before the income, which would be 140k, or after, which would be 180k.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again about the components. The accounting equation is always Assets = Liabilities + Equity. So regardless of profits or losses, the equity is calculated as assets minus liabilities. So if during the year the firm made a profit, that would increase assets or decrease liabilities, but in this case, the total assets and liabilities are given as 240k and 100k, which presumably include any changes from the year's operations.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the timing. The question gives the firm's current totals, including the income. So perhaps the $40k income has already been factored into the assets. So the equity would be 240k -100k =140k, which is option F. But maybe that's not considering the profit.

Alternatively, if the firm's assets increased by $40k due to profit, then the assets would be 240k, which includes that profit. So the equity would still be 140k. Unless the $40k is an expense, but no, the question says income, so it's positive.

Wait, maybe I should think differently. If the firm's equity is 140k, and then they make a profit of 40k, the equity increases by 40k, becoming 180k. But is the question asking for the equity before or after the profit?

The question states that the firm has an income of $40k for the year. So presumably, the $240k in assets already includes the profit. So the equity is 240k-100k=140k. But if the profit isn't part of the assets yet, then the assets would be 240k plus 40k, making it 280k, and then equity would be 280k -100k =180k.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because the assets are given as 240k, so the profit must be included in that. So the equity is 140k, making option F correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the capital as the initial investment plus the retained earnings from the year. So the initial capital is 140k, and the 40k profit adds to it, making 180k.

But the question is phrased as the firm's capital, given those totals. So the assets and liabilities are current, and the income is for the past year. So the 40k would have been added to equity, making the capital 140k +40k=180k.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. I think I need to clarify the concepts here. The basic equation is A = L + E. So E (equity) is 240k -100k=140k. Now, the income for the year is $40k. That income would typically be part of the equity as retained earnings. So the current equity would be 140k +40k=180k.

So the capital would be $180,000, which is option H.

But wait, maybe the income is considered as revenue, not net income. Or perhaps it's the net income, which is added to equity. So if the firm's net income is $40k, then equity increases by that amount.

So in that case, the initial equity is 140k, then adding 40k gives 180k. So the capital is 180k, which is option H.

But I'm a bit confused because sometimes the term 'capital' can be a bit ambiguous. It can refer to the owner's capital account, which might not include retained earnings, or it might. But in accounting, equity includes both contributed capital and retained earnings.

So the correct approach is:

Equity (Capital) = Assets - Liabilities = 240k -100k =140k.

Then, the net income for the year is $40k, which increases equity, so equity becomes 180k.

So the capital after the year is 180k. Therefore, the correct answer would be H: $180,000.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "the capital of a firm that has..." So it's not clear whether the $40k is part of the equity already or not. If the $40k is profit that hasn't been added yet, then the equity is 140k, but if it's already included in the assets, then the equity is 140k.

I think I'm getting myself tied up. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider that the total assets include the income. So if the firm's assets are $240k, that includes any profits from the year. So the equity is 140k, which would be option F.

Alternatively, if the income is not part of the assets yet, then the assets would be 240k before the income, and after adding the 40k income, equity becomes 180k.

But the question is a bit ambiguous. It says the firm has total assets of 240k, total liabilities of 100k, and an income of 40k for the year. So the income is part of the current year's operations, which would have increased the equity.

So the equity is 240k -100k =140k, and then adding the 40k net income, making it 180k.

So the answer would be H: $180,000.

Wait, but another perspective: the income for the year is $40k, which is revenue, but not necessarily profit. Oh, but the question says "income", which could mean net income, i.e., profit after expenses. So if that's the case, then the profit is added to equity, making it 180k.

I think that's the correct approach. So the answer is H.

The question asks for the capital of a firm with total assets of $240,000, total liabilities of $100,000, and an income of $40,000 for one year. To determine the capital, we use the accounting equation:

\[
\text{Assets} = \text{Liabilities} + \text{Equity}
\]

Rearranging for equity (capital):

\[
\text{Equity} = \text{Assets} - \text{Liabilities}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\text{Equity} = \$240,000 - \$100,000 = \$140,000
\]

This represents the initial equity before considering the income for the year. The income of $40,000 is assumed to be net income, which increases equity. Therefore, the total capital (equity) after including the net income is:

\[
\text{Total Capital} = \$140,000 + \$40,000 = \$180,000
\]

Thus, the capital of the firm is **$180,000**, which corresponds to option **H**.

Answer: H
