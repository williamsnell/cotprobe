Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question in front of me, and I'm supposed to figure out the correct answer. Let's break it down step by step. The question has two statements, and I need to evaluate their truthfulness.

Starting with Statement 1: "f: X → Y is continuous and X is compact. f must be uniformly continuous." Hmm, I remember something about continuous functions on compact spaces. Oh right! In topology, I think there's a theorem that says if a function is continuous on a compact set, then it's uniformly continuous. Yeah, that rings a bell. So Statement 1 should be true.

Now, moving on to Statement 2: "If f(x), g(x): R → R are everywhere differentiable, then f(g(x)) must be everywhere differentiable." Wait, differentiable functions... Well, I know that the composition of differentiable functions isn't always differentiable everywhere. Let me think. Suppose f is differentiable, and g is differentiable, but what if g has a point where its derivative is zero? Oh, right, like if g has a stationary point. Then f(g(x)) might have issues. For example, take f(x) = x^2, which is differentiable everywhere, and g(x) = x^3, which is also differentiable everywhere. Now, the composition f(g(x)) is (x^3)^2 = x^6. That's differentiable everywhere, so that example doesn't show a problem. Hmm, maybe another example. Wait, what if f is something like f(x) = |x|, which isn't differentiable at x=0, but wait, the statement says f and g are everywhere differentiable, so f can't be |x| because that's not differentiable at 0. So maybe another angle. Oh, wait, even if f and g are differentiable everywhere, the composition's differentiability depends on the chain rule. The chain rule requires that f' is continuous? Or is it enough that g is differentiable? No, wait, the chain rule says that if g is differentiable at x, and f is differentiable at g(x), then the composition is differentiable at x. But if f is differentiable everywhere, then as long as g is differentiable everywhere, the composition should be differentiable everywhere. Wait, but does that always hold? Hmm. I'm a bit confused now. Maybe I should think about specific functions. Let's see, suppose f(x) is differentiable everywhere, and g(x) is differentiable everywhere. Then f(g(x)) would be differentiable everywhere by the chain rule. Oh, but wait, the chain rule doesn't necessarily require f' to be continuous, just that f is differentiable. So maybe Statement 2 is true? But wait, wait. Let me think of a case where f and g are differentiable, but f(g(x)) isn't. I'm trying to remember. Oh, right! If f is differentiable but its derivative is not continuous, and g has a certain behavior. Wait, no. If f is differentiable everywhere, then the composition with g differentiable everywhere should also be differentiable everywhere. So maybe Statement 2 is true. But wait, I'm not sure. Maybe I should think of Darboux's theorem or something else. Or perhaps consider functions that are differentiable but have derivatives that are not continuous. Oh, wait! Here's an example. Let f(x) be a function that's differentiable everywhere but its derivative is not continuous. For example, f(x) = x² D(x), where D(x) is Dirichlet's function (which is discontinuous everywhere). Wait, but is f differentiable? Hmm, maybe not the best example. Alternatively, take f(x) = x², which is smooth, and g(x) any differentiable function. Then f(g(x)) is differentiable. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. If f and g are everywhere differentiable, then f(g(x)) is differentiable everywhere because the chain rule applies everywhere. So Statement 2 might be true. Wait, but I remember that sometimes when the derivative inside is zero, the composition's differentiability can fail if f isn't twice differentiable. Wait, no. If f is differentiable at g(x) and g is differentiable at x, then f(g(x)) is differentiable at x, regardless of f''(x) existing. So Statement 2 should be true? No, wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Maybe I'm confusing things. Let me think again. Wait, if f and g are both differentiable everywhere, then f(g(x)) is differentiable everywhere. So Statement 2 is true. But wait, I'm not so sure. Let me try to find a counterexample. Suppose f(x) is differentiable everywhere, but its derivative f’(x) is not continuous. Let g(x) be another differentiable function. Then f(g(x))' = f’(g(x)) * g’(x). If f’(g(x)) is not continuous, then the product might not be continuous. But does that affect differentiability? Because even if f’(g(x)) is not continuous, as long as it exists, the product exists as a limit. Or does it? For example, take f(x) = x², which is smooth, and g(x) = x³. Then f(g(x)) is x^6, which is smooth. Another example: let f(x) be a function whose derivative is not continuous, but f is differentiable everywhere. Let me think of such a function. For example, f(x) = x² sin(1/x²) when x≠0, and f(0)=0. The derivative at 0 is 0, but f’(x) elsewhere is 2x sin(1/x²) - (2/x) cos(1/x²). As x approaches 0, f’(x) oscillates wildly and doesn't approach 0. So f’(x) is not continuous at 0. Now, let’s take g(x) = x. Then f(g(x)) = f(x), which is differentiable everywhere, but the derivative is discontinuous at 0. But differentiable doesn't require the derivative to be continuous. So f(g(x)) is differentiable everywhere, but its derivative is discontinuous. So in this case, Statement 2 holds because f(g(x)) is differentiable everywhere. So maybe Statement 2 is true after all.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me think if there's a case where f and g are differentiable everywhere, but f(g(x)) isn't differentiable somewhere. Suppose f(x) is differentiable everywhere, but g(x) is such that g’(x) is zero at some point, and f’(g(x)) is undefined or something. No, because f is differentiable everywhere, so f’(g(x)) exists for all x. So f(g(x)) is differentiable everywhere. So Statement 2 should be true. But wait, wait, I'm getting confused again. Let me think: the chain rule says that if f is differentiable at g(x) and g is differentiable at x, then f(g(x)) is differentiable at x. So if both f and g are differentiable everywhere, then their composition is differentiable everywhere. So Statement 2 is true. But earlier I thought maybe Statement 2 was false. Now I'm getting myself confused.

Wait, but wait, the question says "everywhere differentiable" for f and g, meaning their derivatives exist at every point. Then the composition should also be everywhere differentiable. So Statement 2 is true. But I'm not 100% sure. Let me consider another angle. Suppose f is differentiable everywhere, and g is differentiable everywhere. Then, for every x, f’(g(x)) exists and g’(x) exists, so f(g(x))’ = f’(g(x)) * g’(x) exists. Therefore, the composition is differentiable everywhere. So yes, Statement 2 is true. Wait, but I've heard that just because two functions are differentiable doesn't mean their composition is, but I can't find a counterexample. Hmm. Maybe I was wrong earlier. So Statement 2 is true.

Wait, but now I'm more confused because I thought Statement 2 was true, but maybe I'm making a mistake. Let me think again. Suppose f is differentiable everywhere, and g is differentiable everywhere. Then, for each x, f’(g(x)) exists, and g’(x) exists. So the product exists, so the composition is differentiable everywhere. So Statement 2 is true.

Wait, but this contradicts what I thought earlier. So where am I going wrong? Let me try to find a reliable source or recall a theorem. Oh right, the chain rule: if g is differentiable at x, and f is differentiable at g(x), then f∘g is differentiable at x. So if both f and g are differentiable everywhere, then f∘g is differentiable everywhere. So Statement 2 is true. But wait, I'm now confident that Statement 2 is true.

Wait, but I'm probably wrong because I remember that the composition of differentiable functions isn't necessarily differentiable everywhere. Or maybe I'm confusing with continuity. Let me think of an example. Suppose f(x) is differentiable everywhere, and g(x) is differentiable everywhere. Is f(g(x)) always differentiable everywhere? Yes, according to the chain rule. So Statement 2 is true.

Wait, but I might have made a mistake. Let me try to look for exceptions. Suppose f(x) is differentiable everywhere but its derivative is not continuous. Let’s say f'(x) is everywhere but nowhere continuous. Then, the composition would have f’(g(x)) * g’(x). If g’(x) is zero at some point, then even if f’(g(x)) is discontinuous, the product would still be zero, so the derivative exists. If g’(x) is not zero, then as long as f’(g(x)) exists, the product exists because g’(x) exists. So f(g(x)) is differentiable everywhere. Therefore, Statement 2 is true.

Wait, but I think I'm making a mistake here. Let me think of a more concrete example. Suppose f is differentiable everywhere, and g is differentiable everywhere. Let’s pick f(x) = x² and g(x) = |x|. But wait, g(x) isn’t differentiable at x=0. So that doesn't fit. Let me pick g(x) as x³, which is differentiable everywhere. Then, f(g(x)) = (x³)² = x^6, which is differentiable everywhere. Another example: f(x) = e^x, g(x) = x^2. Then f(g(x)) = e^{x²}, which is smooth. Hmm, seems like Statement 2 holds. So I think Statement 2 is true.

Wait, but I'm not sure anymore. Let me try to think differently. Suppose f is differentiable everywhere, but f’ is not continuous. Let’s say f(x) is differentiable everywhere, but f’(x) has a jump discontinuity. Then, if g’(x) passes through that point, the product f’(g(x)) * g’(x) might not be continuous, but differentiable doesn't require the derivative to be continuous. So as long as the limit exists, it's differentiable. So even if f’ is not continuous, the product would still exist as a limit. So f(g(x)) would be differentiable everywhere. So Statement 2 is true.

Wait, but I'm probably wrong because I've heard somewhere that the composition of differentiable functions isn't necessarily differentiable, but I can't find a counterexample. Maybe I'm confusing with the case where functions aren't differentiable everywhere. So perhaps Statement 2 is true. But I'm not entirely confident.

Wait another thought: If f is differentiable everywhere and g is differentiable everywhere, then f∘g is differentiable everywhere. So Statement 2 is true.

But wait, now I'm really confused because I've heard that the composition of differentiable functions can fail to be differentiable if, for example, the inner function has a critical point where the outer function isn't twice differentiable. But that's about higher-order differentiability, not first-order. So for first-order differentiability, the composition should hold as long as both are differentiable everywhere.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises in cases where the derivative of the outer function isn't continuous. But as I thought earlier, the composition's derivative exists as long as both functions are differentiable everywhere.

So, to sum up:

Statement 1: True.

Statement 2: True.

So the correct option would be J: True, True.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure about Statement 2. Let me think again. The chain rule requires that if g is differentiable at x, and f is differentiable at g(x), then f∘g is differentiable at x. If both f and g are differentiable everywhere, then for every x, f∘g is differentiable at x. So Statement 2 must be true.

So both statements are true, so the answer is J.
</think>

Statement 1: "If \( f: X \to Y \) is continuous and \( X \) is compact, then \( f \) must be uniformly continuous."  
This is true. A fundamental theorem in topology states that any continuous function on a compact space is uniformly continuous. Therefore, Statement 1 is **True**.

Statement 2: "If \( f(x), g(x): \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) are everywhere differentiable, then \( f(g(x)) \) must be everywhere differentiable."  
This is also true. By the chain rule, if \( f \) and \( g \) are differentiable everywhere, then their composition \( f(g(x)) \) is differentiable everywhere. The chain rule guarantees that the derivative of \( f(g(x)) \) exists as long as \( f \) and \( g \) are differentiable. Therefore, Statement 2 is **True**.

Both statements are true, so the correct answer is:

**J: True, True**
