Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Anscombe and what she said about "moral obligation." Alright, let me think through this step by step. 

First, I remember that Anscombe was a philosopher, and I think she wrote something about moral philosophy. Oh right, she wrote an essay called "Modern Moral Philosophy." In that essay, she talked about the concept of moral obligation and how it's used today. 

Wait, what was her main point? I think she argued that the term "moral obligation" has lost its original meaning because it's rooted in a divine law framework. Like, back in the day, when people talked about moral obligations, they were referring to something like divine commands or natural law, which was tied to religion. 

But then, with the Enlightenment and the rise of secularism, people stopped believing in a divine lawgiver. So the concept of moral obligation didn't just disappear; instead, it sort of stuck around but without its original foundation. So Anscombe is saying that when people today talk about moral obligation, they're using a term that doesn't really have a clear, objective basis anymore. 

So, looking at the options, the question is asking what "moral obligation" currently signifies according to Anscombe. Let me go through the options:

A: the beliefs of a certain culture. Hmm, that's more like cultural relativism, which isn't exactly what Anscombe was pointing out. She's more about the loss of the concept rather than it being tied to culture.

B: the laws of a country. No, laws are more about legal obligations, not moral ones.

C: the thoughts of an influential person. That doesn't seem right either. Influential people can shape opinions, but that's not what Anscombe was focusing on.

D: the commands of God. Well, that's the original basis she's talking about, but she's saying that this is no longer the case. So now, it's not about God's commands anymore.

E: the feelings of an individual. That's more like subjectivism, which might be part of it, but I don't think that's the main point she's making.

F: the desires of a community. That's closer to cultural or societal desires, but again, not exactly what she's getting at.

G: no real concept at all. Wait, that sounds familiar. She argues that without the divine framework, the term "moral obligation" doesn't have a real, substantive meaning anymore. So it's become an empty concept, a survival from a previous era.

H: the teachings of philosophy. Well, philosophers have different theories, but Anscombe is more critical of how the term is used without a clear basis.

I: the norms of a society. That's similar to cultural norms, but again, she's talking about the concept being incoherent now, not just based on society.

J: the rules of a religious institution. That's related to D, but again, she's saying that since people don't believe in that anymore, the term has lost its meaning.

So putting it all together, Anscombe's view is that "moral obligation" doesn't have a real concept now. So the answer should be G.

According to Anscombe, "moral obligation" currently signifies no real concept at all. She argued that the term has lost its original foundation in divine law and now lacks a clear, objective basis in a secular context.
