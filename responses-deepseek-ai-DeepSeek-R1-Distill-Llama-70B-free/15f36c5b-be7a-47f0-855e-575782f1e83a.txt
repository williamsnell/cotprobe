Okay, so I've got this question here about whether the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard Gaussian distribution is log-concave. Hmm, I remember that log-concave functions have some specific properties, especially related to their second derivatives. Wait, log-concave means that the logarithm of the function is concave, right? So if we take the log of F(x) and check if it's concave, that should tell us.

The given CDF is F(x) = (1/√(2π)) ∫ from -infty to x of e^(-t²/2) dt. Oh wait, that's the CDF of the standard normal distribution. So F(x) is the integral of the standard normal PDF, which is φ(t) = (1/√(2π)) e^(-t²/2). 

Log-concave in the context of probability distributions usually applies to the PDF, but wait, the question is about the CDF. Or wait, no, log-concave distributions have PDFs that are log-concave. Wait, maybe the CDF can be log-concave as well. I'm a bit confused here. Let me think.

Wait, the problem states that F(x) is the CDF, and we're to determine if it's log-concave. So I think log-concavity for a function means that the function itself is concave when you take the logarithm of it. So, for F(x), we need to compute log(F(x)) and check if that's a concave function.

But wait, I'm a bit rusty. Concave functions have the property that their second derivative is non-positive. So, for a function to be log-concave, the second derivative of log(F(x)) must be ≤ 0 everywhere.

So, let me try to compute the derivatives. Let's denote F(x) as Φ(x), the standard normal CDF. Then, log(Φ(x)) would be the function we're considering.

The first derivative of log(Φ(x)) is [Φ'(x)/Φ(x)]. Φ'(x) is φ(x) = (1/√(2π)) e^(-x²/2). So log(Φ(x))' = φ(x)/Φ(x).

The second derivative would be the derivative of this. So we have [φ'(x)Φ(x) - φ(x)^2] / [Φ(x)]^2.

Wait, let's compute this step by step. Let me write it out.

Let’s denote y = log(Φ(x)). Then dy/dx = φ(x)/Φ(x) = (e^(-x²/2)/(√(2π))) / Φ(x).

Now, to find the second derivative, d²y/dx², we can use the quotient rule. Let’s denote numerator as u = φ(x) = (1/√(2π)) e^(-x²/2), denominator as v = Φ(x).

So dy/dx = u/v.

Then, d²y/dx² = (u' v - u v') / v².

Compute u' (derivative of φ(x)): u = (1/√(2π)) e^(-x²/2).

So u' = (1/√(2π)) * (-x) e^(-x²/2) = -x φ(x).

Now, v is Φ(x), so v' is φ(x) = u.

Putting it all together:

d²y/dx² = [ (-x φ(x)) * Φ(x) - φ(x) * φ(x) ] / [Φ(x)]².

Factor out φ(x) from the numerator:

φ(x) [ -x Φ(x) - φ(x) ] / [Φ(x)]².

Wait, so d²y/dx² = [ -x Φ(x) - φ(x) ] * φ(x) / [Φ(x)]².

Hmm, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recheck the numerator:

u' is -x φ(x), and v is Φ(x). So u'v is -x φ(x) Φ(x).

Then, u v' is φ(x) * φ(x) = [φ(x)]².

So the numerator becomes (u'v - uv') = (-x φ(x) Φ(x) - [φ(x)]²).

Wait, no, because the expression is u'v - u v', so it's (-x φ(x) Φ(x)) - (φ(x) * φ(x)).

So, numerator is -x φ(x) Φ(x) - [φ(x)]².

Thus, d²y/dx² = [ -x φ(x) Φ(x) - (φ(x))^2 ] / [Φ(x)]².

We can factor out φ(x) from numerator:

φ(x) [ -x Φ(x) - φ(x) ] / [Φ(x)]².

So, we have:

d²y/dx² = [ -x Φ(x) - φ(x) ] * φ(x) / [Φ(x)]².

Wait, but I'm not sure if this helps. Maybe I should think about the sign of this second derivative.

But wait, I'm getting a bit stuck in the algebra. Maybe there's a simpler approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can recall some properties of the normal distribution's CDF.

I remember that the standard normal CDF Φ(x) is log-concave. Wait, no, log-concave is a property usually discussed for the PDF, not the CDF. Because the PDF of the normal distribution is log-concave. So perhaps the CDF is not necessarily log-concave.

Wait, but wait, the CDF is the integral of the PDF. So if the PDF is log-concave, does that imply anything about the CDF's log-concavity? I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the function F(x) and whether it's log-concave. So, to determine log-concavity, log(F(x)) must be concave in x. So a function F is log-concave if for any x, y and λ ∈ [0,1], F(λx + (1-λ)y) ≥ F(x)^λ F(y)^{1-λ}.

Alternatively, the more practical way is to check the sign of the second derivative of log(F(x)).

Wait, but perhaps I can think about the behavior of Φ(x). As x increases, Φ(x) approaches 1. For x near negative infinity, Φ(x) approaches 0. So in the middle, Φ(x) is increasing, but does it have regions where log(Φ(x)) is concave or convex?

Wait, perhaps I can compute the second derivative numerically for some x to see the sign.

Wait, let's pick x = 0. At x=0, Φ(0) = 0.5. The PDF at x=0 is φ(0) = 1/√(2π) ≈ 0.3989.

So, the first derivative of log(Φ(x)) at x=0 is φ(0)/Φ(0) = 0.3989 / 0.5 ≈ 0.7978.

Now, the second derivative at x=0: Let's compute the numerator.

At x=0, Φ(x) = 0.5, φ(x)= 0.3989.

So, numerator is [ -0 * 0.5 * 0.3989 - (0.3989)^2 ] = - (0.3989)^2 ≈ -0.159.

Denominator is (0.5)^2 = 0.25.

So, d²y/dx² at x=0 is approximately (-0.159) / 0.25 ≈ -0.636.

So the second derivative is negative at x=0. Which would imply that log(Φ(x)) is concave at x=0. But wait, to be log-concave, the function log(F(x)) must be concave everywhere. So if at some point the second derivative is negative, but what about other points?

Wait, let's pick x = 1. Φ(1) ≈ 0.8413, φ(1) ≈ 0.2420.

The numerator is [ -1 * 0.8413 * 0.2420 - (0.2420)^2 ].

Calculating:

-1 * 0.8413 * 0.2420 ≈ -0.2036.

(0.2420)^2 ≈ 0.0585.

So numerator ≈ -0.2036 - 0.0585 ≈ -0.2621.

Denominator is (0.8413)^2 ≈ 0.7081.

So d²y/dx² ≈ -0.2621 / 0.7081 ≈ -0.3701. Still negative.

What about x=2? Φ(2) ≈ 0.9772, φ(2) ≈ 0.0540.

Numerator: [ -2 * 0.9772 * 0.0540 - (0.0540)^2 ]

Calculate each term:

-2 * 0.9772 * 0.0540 ≈ -2 * 0.0528 ≈ -0.1056.

(0.0540)^2 ≈ 0.002916.

So numerator ≈ -0.1056 - 0.002916 ≈ -0.1085.

Denominator (0.9772)^2 ≈ 0.9548.

So d²y/dx² ≈ -0.1085 / 0.9548 ≈ -0.1136. Negative again.

What about x approaching infinity? As x → ∞, Φ(x) → 1, φ(x) → 0.

So, numerator becomes [ -x * 1 * 0 - 0 ] → 0, but let's see the behavior. Wait, as x increases, φ(x) decreases exponentially, so at higher x, φ(x) is negligible. So the numerator is dominated by the first term: -x Φ(x) φ(x). At high x, Φ(x) approaches 1, so numerator ≈ -x φ(x) * 1.

But wait, φ(x) at high x is (1/√(2π)) e^{-x²/2}. So for large x, φ(x) is very small, but x is large. So the product x φ(x) would be something like x e^{-x²/2} which tends to zero as x approaches infinity, because exponential decay dominates polynomial growth.

So for very large x, the numerator approaches 0 from the negative side because of the negative sign. The denominator approaches 1 squared, which is 1. So the second derivative approaches 0 from below.

So, in all the points I checked, the second derivative of log(Φ(x)) is negative. That suggests that log(Φ(x)) is concave everywhere, which would imply that Φ(x) is log-concave.

Wait, but wait. Wait, the definition I remember is that a function f is log-concave if log(f(x)) is concave. So if the second derivative of log(f(x)) is ≤ 0 everywhere, then it's log-concave.

So if in all the points I checked, the second derivative is negative, then log(Φ(x)) is concave, so Φ(x) is log-concave.

But wait, I thought that log-concave usually refers to the PDF, not the CDF. But according to this, the CDF's log is concave.

Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again: for the PDF f(x) of a normal distribution, which is f(x)= (1/√(2π)) e^{-x²/2}, log(f(x)) = C - x²/2, which is clearly concave because the second derivative is -1, which is negative. So the normal PDF is log-concave.

But for the CDF, the function Φ(x) is the integral of the PDF from -infty to x. So in this case, does Φ(x) being log-concave hold?

From my earlier calculations, the second derivative of log(Φ(x)) is negative wherever I checked. So that would imply that Φ(x) is log-concave.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the behavior near x approaching negative infinity. Because as x approaches -infty, Φ(x) approaches 0. So log(Φ(x)) approaches negative infinity. But what about the second derivative there?

At x approaching -infty, Φ(x) approaches 0, and φ(x) approaches 0 as well, but from the positive side. So let's compute the second derivative in that limit.

Wait, as x → -infty, Φ(x) approaches 0, and φ(x) approaches 0. Let's see:

The numerator is [ -x Φ(x) φ(x) - (φ(x))^2 ].

So, as x→-infty, -x is positive and large. Φ(x) approaches 0, so the first term is positive and potentially large. Because φ(x) is (1/√(2π)) e^{-x²/2}, which for x negative is same as e^{-x²/2}.

Wait, but when x is a large negative number, say x = -a where a is a large positive, then x² = a², so e^{-x²/2} is same as e^{-a²/2}, which is tiny.

So, [ -x Φ(x) φ(x) ] → positive infinity * 0 * 0? Wait, no, let me think again.

Wait, x is large and negative, so -x is large positive. Φ(x) is approaching 0, φ(x) is approaching 0.

But let's see the first term: -x Φ(x) φ(x) = (-x) * Φ(x) * φ(x).

As x → -infty, Φ(x) ≈ (1/√(2π)) ∫_{-infty}^x e^{-t²/2} dt. For x very negative, this integral is approximately zero. So Φ(x) ≈ 0, and φ(x) is approximately zero.

But perhaps the product is of the order x e^{-x²/2} multiplied by e^{-x²/2} again, but that's getting a bit messy.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use a series expansion for Φ(x) around x approaching negative infinity. Wait, perhaps using the asymptotic expansion for the error function.

But this might get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can reason that for x very negative, Φ(x) is very small, and the second derivative might be positive. Let me think.

Wait, when x is a very large negative number, like x = -10. Then Φ(-10) is approximately 0, and φ(-10) is almost zero. So let's compute the numerator:

[ -x Φ(x) φ(x) - [φ(x)]^2 ].

At x = -10, x is -10, so -x is 10. Φ(x) is almost 0, so the first term is 10 * 0 * 0, which is 0. The second term is [φ(x)]², which is (tiny)^2, so the numerator is negative. So at x = -10, the second derivative is negative.

Wait, but wait, when x approaches negative infinity, what happens? Let's see.

Another approach: perhaps take x very large in magnitude but negative. Let's say x = -a, where a is a large positive number.

So, Φ(-a) = P(Z ≤ -a) = 1 - Φ(a) ≈ (1/(√(2π) a)) e^{-a²/2} for large a (using the approximation for the CDF tails).

And φ(-a) = (1/√(2π)) e^{-a²/2}.

So, let's compute the numerator of the second derivative:

[ -x Φ(x) φ(x) - [φ(x)]^2 ] = [ a * Φ(-a) * φ(-a) - [φ(-a)]^2 ].

Plugging in the approximations:

Φ(-a) ≈ (1/(√(2π) a)) e^{-a²/2}.

So, a * Φ(-a) = a * [1/(√(2π) a)] e^{-a²/2} = (1/√(2π)) e^{-a²/2}.

Thus, a * Φ(-a) * φ(-a) = (1/√(2π)) e^{-a²/2} * (1/√(2π)) e^{-a²/2} = (1/(2π)) e^{-a²}.

And [φ(-a)]^2 = (1/(2π)) e^{-a²}.

So the numerator becomes (1/(2π)) e^{-a²} - (1/(2π)) e^{-a²} = 0.

Wait, but that's only the leading term. There might be higher-order terms. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps using a more precise approximation for Φ(-a). From the error function, Φ(-a) ≈ (1/(√(2π) a)) e^{-a²/2} [1 - 1/(a²) + ... ].

But perhaps, for the leading order, the numerator is (1/(2π)) e^{-a²} - (1/(2π)) e^{-a²} = 0.

Wait, that would suggest that the numerator approaches zero, but the denominator is [Φ(-a)]^2 ≈ [ (1/(√(2π) a)) e^{-a²/2} ]^2 = (1/(2π a²)) e^{-a²}.

So, the second derivative is approximately [0] / [ (1/(2π a²)) e^{-a²} ] = 0.

So as x approaches -infty, the second derivative approaches zero. So perhaps the second derivative remains negative everywhere.

Wait, but earlier when I checked at x = -10, the numerator was negative, leading to a negative second derivative.

So, perhaps the second derivative of log(Φ(x)) is always negative, implying that log(Φ(x)) is concave everywhere, thus making Φ(x) log-concave.

So if that's the case, then the answer is yes, F(x) is log-concave, so return 1.

Looking back at the options, the answer options are A through J, with G being 1.0. So the correct answer would be G.

The question asks whether the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard Gaussian distribution, given by:

\[
F(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}} \int_{-\infty}^x e^{-t^2/2} dt,

is log-concave. A function \( F(x) \) is log-concave if \( \log(F(x)) \) is concave, which requires that
