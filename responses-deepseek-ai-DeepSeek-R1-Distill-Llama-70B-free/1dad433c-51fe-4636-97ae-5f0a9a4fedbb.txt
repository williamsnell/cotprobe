Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about auditing procedures, and I'm trying to figure out the correct answer. Let me break it down step by step.

The question is asking which procedure an auditor would most likely perform to obtain evidence about the occurrence of subsequent events. Subsequent events are things that happen after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are issued. I remember that auditors need to check these because they can affect the financial statements, like if a company has a significant lawsuit loss after the balance sheet date.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Check compliance with laws during the subsequent period. Hmm, I'm not sure. Compliance checks are more about internal controls and might relate to different audit areas, not specifically subsequent events.

Option B: Assess financial stability of key customers and suppliers. That sounds more like a risk assessment or part of understanding the business environment. Maybe it's about going concern issues, not directly about subsequent events evidence.

Option C: Trace shipping docs to sales invoices and journals. That seems like testing for revenue transactions, maybe cutoff procedures. Not sure how it ties directly to subsequent events.

Option D: Evaluate allowance for doubtful accounts. That's about accounts receivable and estimating bad debts. Not directly a subsequent event procedure.

Option E: Physical inventory count. Wait, the physical count happens around year-end, right? So after the balance sheet date. But that's for inventory valuation, not necessarily subsequent events.

Option F: Verify inventory pledged under loans by confirming with banks. That's about using confirmations for asset verification. Maybe not directly about subsequent events unless the pledge happened after the balance sheet date.

Option G: Compare financials with prior year. That's more about trend analysis, not specifically subsequent events.

Option H: Inquire about the status of transactions based on preliminary data. Oh, right! I remember that subsequent events can include transactions that were recorded using estimates or preliminary data. The auditor would want to check if these estimates were settled or adjusted post balance sheet date. So they might inquire about the current status of these transactions.

Wait, let me think again. Subsequent events can be adjusting or non-adjusting. Adjusting events provide evidence of conditions existing at the balance sheet date, like lawsuits pending. Non-adjusting events, like a fire after year-end, may require disclosure but not adjustment.

Auditors need to perform procedures to identify these. So what procedures do they do? They might inquire of management, read minutes, check legal documents, etc. But the question is about obtaining evidence about the occurrence, so maybe procedures to confirm if events happened.

Option H says inquiring about transactions recorded on preliminary data. That makes sense because the auditor would want to confirm whether those preliminary estimates have been resolved or if there's any change. For example, if the company booked a contingent liability based on a preliminary legal case, the auditor would check if the case settled after year-end.

So I think the correct answer is H.

The correct answer is:

H: Inquire about the current status of transactions that were recorded on the basis of preliminary data.

This is because subsequent events involve occurrences after the balance sheet date that may affect the financial statements. Auditors must verify whether preliminary estimates or recorded transactions were settled or adjusted after the balance sheet date. Inquiring about their current status helps confirm if adjustments or disclosures are necessary.
