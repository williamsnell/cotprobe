Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an elevator and tension. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says the elevator is accelerating upward at 2 ft/sec², and it weighs 500 lb. I need to find the tension in the supporting cable. Oh right, tension in the cable is what's holding the elevator up and causing the acceleration.

Wait, I remember that when an object accelerates upward, the forces involved are the tension pulling up and the weight pulling down. Newton's second law applies here. F_net equals mass times acceleration. But wait, the weight is given in pounds, which is a force. Oh right, in the English system, weight (W) is mass times gravity. So W = m * g. But sometimes when working in pounds, it's easier to think in terms of force.

So the elevator's weight is 500 lb. When it's accelerating upward, the tension T must be greater than the weight because the net force is upward.

Newton's second law says T - W = m * a. But wait, I'm mixing units here. Oh wait, in the English system, mass is in slugs, which I might need to convert.

Alternatively, I think there's another way when dealing with pounds. Since weight is already a force, maybe I can use F_net = (W/g) * a, where g is the acceleration due to gravity. Oh wait, that might work.

Wait, let me think again. The net force is T - W, which equals m*a. But W is m*g, so substituting, T - m*g = m*a. So T = m*(g +a).

But here, I have W = m*g, so m = W/g. So T = (W/g) * (g + a) = W + (W*a)/g.

Yes, that makes sense. So plugging in the numbers. W is 500 lb, a is 2 ft/s², and g is 32 ft/s².

So T = 500 + (500 * 2)/32.

Let me calculate that. 500 *2 is 1000. 1000 divided by 32 is approximately 31.25. So T = 500 + 31.25 = 531.25 lb.

Looking at the options, option B is 531.2 lb. That's really close. So the correct answer should be B.

Wait, let me double-check the approach. Another way is to compute the net force. The elevator's mass is weight divided by g, so m = 500 /32 slugs. Then, F_net is m*a = (500/32)*2 = 500*2/32 = 31.25 lb. So the tension must be weight plus net force, which is 500 +31.25=531.25. Yep, same result.

So yeah, I'm confident the answer is B.

To determine the tension in the supporting cable of the elevator, we use Newton's second law of motion. The elevator has a weight \( W = 500 \, \text{lb} \) and is accelerating upward at \( a = 2 \, \text{ft/sec}^2 \). The tension \( T \) in the cable must counteract the weight and provide the additional force for acceleration.

The relationship is given by:

\[
T = W + \frac{W \cdot a}{g}
\]

where \( g = 32 \, \text{ft/sec}^2 \) is the acceleration due to gravity. Substituting the values:

\[
T = 500 + \frac{500 \cdot 2}{32}
\]

\[
T = 500 + \frac{1000}{32}
\]

\[
T = 500 + 31.25 = 531.25 \, \text{lb}
\]

From the options provided, the closest value is \( 531.2 \, \text{lb} \), which corresponds to option B.

**Answer: B**
