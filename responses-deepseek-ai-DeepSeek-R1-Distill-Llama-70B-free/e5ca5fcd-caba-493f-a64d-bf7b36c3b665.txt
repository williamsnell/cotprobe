Okay, so I have this question about Erik Erikson's theory of psychosocial development. I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, but I remember he had eight stages, each with a specific crisis or conflict. The question is about the developmental crisis for a young adult.

I think the stages go from infancy through old age. Let me try to recall them in order. The first one is trust vs. mistrust during infancy. Then, toddlerhood is autonomy vs. shame and guilt. Next, around preschool age, it's initiative vs. guilt. Then school-age children face industry vs. inferiority. Adolescents deal with identity vs. role confusion. So after that comes young adulthood. 

Wait, what's the order again? So after identity comes intimacy. Oh right, the sixth stage is young adulthood, and the crisis there is intimacy versus isolation. Yeah, that sounds right. So the question is asking about a young adult, so the correct answer should be G: intimacy vs. isolation.

Let me make sure I'm not mixing up the stages. So the eighth stage is old age with integrity vs. despair. So the options given are:

A: autonomy vs. shame... that's stage 2, toddlers.

B: integrity vs. despair, that's stage 8.

C: identity vs. role confusion, which is stage 5, adolescents.

D: empathy vs. apathy, not sure if that's one of the stages, maybe not.

E: initiative vs. guilt, that's stage 3, preschoolers.

F: generativity vs. stagnation, which is stage 7, middle adulthood.

G: intimacy vs. isolation, stage 6, young adults.

So the correct answer should be G.

The correct answer is G: intimacy vs. isolation. This is the sixth stage in Erikson's theory, corresponding to young adulthood, where the individual faces the crisis of forming intimate relationships or risking isolation.

Answer: G
