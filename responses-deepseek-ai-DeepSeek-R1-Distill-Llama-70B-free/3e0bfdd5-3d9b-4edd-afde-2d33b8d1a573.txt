Okay, so I have this question here about converting temperature from Fahrenheit to Kelvin. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my temperature conversions, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says the temperature is 77°F, which is ambient, like room temperature. I remember that to convert Fahrenheit to Kelvin, I probably have to go through Celsius first because I don't recall a direct formula from Fahrenheit to Kelvin. Right, the steps are probably: Fahrenheit to Celsius, then Celsius to Kelvin.

So first, how do I convert Fahrenheit to Celsius? Oh wait, the formula is something like subtracting 32 and then multiplying by 5/9. Let me get that straight. The formula is C = (F - 32) * (5/9). Yeah, that sounds right.

Let me plug in 77°F into that. So 77 minus 32 is... 45. Then multiply by 5/9. Wait, 45 times 5 is 225, divided by 9. So 225 ÷ 9 equals 25. Oh, so 77°F is 25°C. That makes sense because I remember that 70s in Fahrenheit are like mid 20s in Celsius.

Now, I need to convert Celsius to Kelvin. Oh right, Kelvin is just Celsius plus 273.15. So if it's 25°C, then in Kelvin it's 25 + 273.15. Let me do the math. 273 plus 25 is 298. So that would be 298.15 K, but I think sometimes we round it to a whole number.

Looking at the options given, option F is 298 Kelvin. That must be the correct answer. Let me just double-check my steps. Starting with 77°F, subtract 32 gives 45. Multiply by 5/9 gives 25°C. Then add 273.15 to get Kelvin, which is 298.15, so 298 K when rounded. Yep, that matches option F.

To convert 77°F to Kelvin, first convert it to Celsius using the formula:

\[ C = \frac{5}{9}(F - 32) \]

Substituting \( F = 77 \):

\[ C = \frac{5}{9}(77 - 32) = \frac{5}{9}(45) = 25 \, ^\circ\text{C} \]

Next, convert Celsius to Kelvin by adding 273.15:

\[ K = C + 273.15 = 25 + 273.15 = 298.15 \, \text{K} \]

Rounding to the nearest whole number gives \( 298 \, \text{K} \), which corresponds to option F.

Answer: F
