Okay, so I've got this question about cystic fibrosis complications, and I need to figure out which one isn't recognized. Hmm. Let's start by recalling what I know about cystic fibrosis (CF).

CF is a genetic disorder that primarily affects the lungs and digestive system. It causes the mucus to become thick and sticky, leading to various issues. The main complications I remember are related to the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Cancer of the oesophagus. I'm not too sure about this one. I know CF patients can have issues with their digestive tract, like malnutrition or pancreatic insufficiency, but do they have a higher risk for esophageal cancer? Maybe, but I'm not certain. I'll have to think about this more.

Option B: Liver cirrhosis. Yes, CF can cause liver problems. The thick mucus can block bile ducts, leading to liver damage and cirrhosis over time. So B is a recognized complication.

Option C: Congenital absence of the vas deferens. Oh right, CF is linked to issues with the reproductive system. A significant number of males with CF have congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD), which makes them infertile. So C is definitely a complication.

Option D: Diabetes mellitus. CF-related diabetes (CFRD) is a known complication. The thick mucus can damage the pancreas, impairing insulin production. So D is a recognized issue.

Wait, back to option A. I'm trying to remember if CF increases the risk for specific cancers. I know that CF patients can have issues like osteoporosis, CF-related diabetes, and liver disease. But esophageal cancer... I'm not sure. Maybe it's not a direct complication. Or perhaps it's related to gastroesophageal reflux, which CF patients might experience. But I don't recall esophageal cancer being a commonly listed complication. 

Alternatively, maybe it's more about the increased risk of certain cancers in general. I think CF patients might have an increased risk of some cancers, but I'm not sure about the esophagus specifically. Another angle: the question is asking which is NOT a recognized complication. So if B, C, D are all known, then A would be the correct answer as the unrecognized one.

So putting it all together, the complications are liver cirrhosis (B), absence of vas deferens (C), and diabetes (D). The one that's not recognized is esophageal cancer (A).

The question asks which of the listed options is not a recognized complication of cystic fibrosis (CF). Here's an analysis of each option:

- **Option A: Cancer of the oesophagus**  
  While CF can lead to various complications, including gastrointestinal issues, esophageal cancer is not commonly recognized as a direct complication of CF. There is no strong evidence linking CF to an increased risk of esophageal cancer.

- **Option B: Liver cirrhosis**  
  CF can cause liver complications due to thick mucus blocking bile ducts, leading to liver damage and cirrhosis. This is a well-recognized complication.

- **Option C: Congenital absence of the vas deferens**  
  This is a known complication of CF, particularly in males, leading to infertility. It is a well-documented issue.

- **Option D: Diabetes mellitus**  
  CF-related diabetes (CFRD) is a recognized complication, as the disease can damage the pancreas and impair insulin production.

Based on this analysis, the complication that is not recognized is **Option A: Cancer of the oesophagus**.

Answer: A
