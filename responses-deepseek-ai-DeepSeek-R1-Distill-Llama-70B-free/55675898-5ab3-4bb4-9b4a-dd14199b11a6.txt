Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an artificial satellite and a meteor collision. Hmm, let me try to break this down. The satellite is orbiting Earth just above the atmosphere in a circular orbit with a constant speed. Then a meteor hits it at point P, increasing its speed by 1%, but the direction of the velocity stays the same. I need to figure out what the new orbit looks like.

Alright, I remember that the orbit of a satellite is determined by its velocity and the gravitational force from Earth. For a circular orbit, the satellite's speed is just right to balance the gravitational pull, providing the necessary centripetal force. The formula for the orbital speed in a circular orbit is v = sqrt(G*M/r), where G is the gravitational constant, M is Earth's mass, and r is the radius of the orbit.

So if the satellite's speed increases by 1%, what happens? Well, when the speed increases, the satellite might no longer be in a stable circular orbit. I think this has to do with the concept of escape velocity and the different types of orbits—elliptical, parabolic, hyperbolic, etc.

Wait, the key here is that the collision changes the satellite's velocity. Since the velocity is increased at a specific point (P), the orbit will change. In a circular orbit, the velocity is precisely the circular orbital velocity for that radius. If the speed increases beyond that, the satellite might start moving in an elliptical orbit.

But wait, when you increase the speed, does it go into a higher orbit or a lower one? I remember that for orbits, a higher speed at a given point can lead to a different orbital path. Let me think about the vis-viva equation, which applies to any orbit. The equation is v² = GM*(2/r - 1/a), where a is the semi-major axis of the orbit.

In the original circular orbit, the semi-major axis a is equal to the radius r because the orbit is a circle. So initially, v_initial² = GM*(2/r - 1/r) ) because a=r. Simplifying that, v_initial² = GM*(1/r) → which matches the circular orbit formula.

After the collision, the velocity increases. Let's say the new velocity is v' = 1.01*v_initial. Let me plug this into the vis-viva equation. So (v')² = GM*(2/r - 1/a'), where a' is the new semi-major axis.

So v'^2 = (1.01)^2 * GM/r. But the right side is GM*(2/r - 1/a'). Let me set them equal:

(1.01)^2 * (GM/r) ) = GM*(2/r - 1/a').

Divide both sides by GM to cancel it out:

(1.01)^2 / r = (2/r - 1/a').

Multiply both sides by r to simplify:

(1.01)^2 = 2 - (r/a').

So 1.0201 ≈ 2 - (r/a') → r/a' ≈ 2 -1.0201 = 0.9799 → a' ≈ r / 0.9799 ≈ 1.0207 r.

Wait, that suggests that the semi-major axis a' is larger than r. So the orbit becomes elliptical with a larger semi-major axis. But wait, when the velocity increases, the satellite has more kinetic energy, so it's able to move further away. So the new orbit can't be a circle anymore.

In an elliptical orbit, the point where the satellite is when it receives the velocity boost becomes important. Since it's moving faster than the circular speed at that point, what does that imply about the shape of the new orbit?

In a circular orbit, the velocity is such that the centripetal force is provided by gravity. If the velocity increases at that point, the satellite will no longer follow the circular path. It will start to move away from Earth because the increased speed provides more than the required centripetal force, leading it to climb to a higher altitude.

Wait, but in orbital mechanics, if you increase the speed of a satellite beyond the circular velocity at that radius, the orbit becomes elliptical with a higher apogee. Because the satellite now has enough energy to reach a higher point. So the point P, where the collision occurs, would be the perigee (closest approach) of the new elliptical orbit. Because at that point, the velocity is higher than the circular speed, so the satellite is moving away from Earth, heading towards the apogee.

So the options: looking back, the options are about what the new orbit is. Option G says the new orbit is an ellipse with P as the closest approach. Option B says P is the farthest approach, which would be the apogee, but that's not the case here.

So the correct answer should be G.

Wait, wait, let me double-check. When you're in a circular orbit and you give a sudden increase in velocity, the orbit becomes elliptical. If the velocity is increased, the satellite will have a higher trajectory. The point where you apply the impulse (P) will be the perigee, the closest point, because the velocity is higher there. So the new orbit's closest point is P.

Yes, that makes sense. Because in an elliptical orbit, the perigee is where the satellite moves the fastest, and the apogee is where it moves the slowest. So if you boost speed at P, P becomes the perigee, and the satellite moves away, slows down as it goes up, reaches apogee, then comes back.

So the correct option is G: an ellipse with P as the closest approach.

When an artificial satellite orbits Earth in a circular orbit, its speed is precisely balanced to maintain that orbit via the gravitational force. If a meteor collides with the satellite, increasing its speed by 1% without changing the direction of its velocity, the satellite's orbit will change.

The orbital velocity for a circular orbit is given by \( v = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}} \), where \( G \) is the gravitational constant, \( M \) is Earth's mass, and \( r \) is the orbital radius. Increasing the satellite's speed means its velocity exceeds the circular orbital velocity at that radius, disrupting the circular orbit. The new orbit will be elliptical, as the satellite now has more energy.

Using the vis-viva equation, \( v^2 = GM \left( \frac{2}{r} - \frac{1}{a} \right) \), where \( a \) is the semi-major axis of the orbit, it can be shown that the semi-major axis increases when the velocity increases. This means the satellite will move farther from Earth, and the point of collision, \( P \), will become the perigee (closest approach) of the new elliptical orbit. At \( P \), the satellite has the highest speed in its new orbit, consistent with the characteristics of an elliptical orbit.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option G** correctly states that the satellite orbits in an ellipse with \( P \) as the closest approach (perigee).
- Other options, such as \( P \) being the farthest approach (apogee) or the orbit remaining circular, are inconsistent with the physics of the situation.

Thus, the correct answer is:

G: The satellite now orbits in an ellipse, with \( P \) as the closest approach to Earth.
