The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"The struggle against neo-colonialism is not aimed at excluding the capital of the developed world from operating in less developed countries. It is aimed at preventing the financial power of the developed countries being used in such a way as to impoverish the less developed.
Non-alignment, as practiced by Ghana and many other countries, is based on co-operation with all States whether they be capitalist, socialist or have a mixed economy. Such a policy, therefore, involves foreign investment from capitalist countries, but it must be invested in accordance with a national plan drawn up by the government of the non-aligned State with its own interests in mind. The issue is not what return the foreign investor receives on his investments…The question is one of power. A State in the grip of neo-colonialism is not master of its own destiny."
Kwame Nkrumah, Neo-Colonialism, 1965
Which of the following is referenced by the co-operation mentioned in the second paragraph?

Options:

A: The competing ideologies of World War II
B: The competing colonization companies in the Scramble for Africa
C: The competing empires of World War I
D: The competing blocs during the Korean War
E: The competing empires during the Crusades
F: The competing ideologies of the Cold War
G: The competing powers during the Industrial Revolution

I: The competing political systems during the French Revolution
J: The competing alliances during the Napoleonic Wars

Alright, let's tackle this question. So, the question is about a passage from Kwame Nkrumah's "Neo-Colonialism" from 1965. The passage talks about non-alignment and cooperation with various states regardless of their economic systems—capitalist, socialist, or mixed economies. The key point is that these countries are cooperating with all states, but the foreign investment has to align with the national plan, focusing on the state's own interests and not just the return for the investor. The question is asking which event or concept the cooperation mentioned refers to.

Hmm, okay. So the options are from A to J, each referring to different historical events or periods. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: Competing ideologies of WWII. Well, WWII was more about Axis vs Allies, but the main ideologies were fascism vs democracy and communism. But Nkrumah is talking about post-WWII, so maybe not directly related.

Option B: Competing colonization companies during the Scramble for Africa. The Scramble was in the late 19th to early 20th century. Nkrumah's Ghana was involved in independence movements post-WWII, so probably not this.

Option C: Competing empires of WWI. WWI empires were more about European powers fighting each other, but again, this is before Nkrumah's time, and the context is more about economic systems than empires fighting.

Option D: Competing blocs during the Korean War. The Korean War was part of the Cold War, a proxy conflict. But the term "blocs" sounds like the Cold War divisions, which would fit, but I'm not sure.

Option E: Competing empires during the Crusades. That's way too early, so probably not.

Option F: Competing ideologies of the Cold War. The Cold War was between capitalist and communist blocs. Non-alignment was a policy where countries didn't align with either, so this seems relevant. Nkrumah's Ghana is an example of a non-aligned state during the Cold War.

Option G: Competing powers during the Industrial Revolution. That's 18th-19th century, so not matching the 1965 context.

Option H: Competing nations during the Cuban Missile Crisis. That's a specific event in 1962, part of the Cold War. But the question is about the broader concept of cooperation with all states, which aligns more with the general Cold War context rather than a single event.

Option I: Competing political systems during the French Revolution. That's late 18th century, so not relevant here.

Option J: Competing alliances during the Napoleonic Wars. Early 19th century, so no.

Putting this together, the passage mentions cooperation with all states regardless of their economic system, which aligns with the Non-Aligned Movement. This movement was prominent during the Cold War, as countries sought to avoid taking sides between the capitalist (US-led) and communist (USSR-led) blocs. So the cooperation mentioned is about the competing ideologies of the Cold War.

Wait, but the options refer to "the competing ideologies of the Cold War" as option F and "the competing blocs during the Korean War" as D. The Korean War was part of the Cold War, but the broader concept is the Cold War's competing ideologies. So the answer should be F.

The passage by Kwame Nkrumah discusses non-alignment as a policy of cooperation with states of all economic systems—capitalist, socialist, or mixed economies. This aligns with the Non-Aligned Movement, which emerged during the Cold War as countries sought to avoid taking sides between the capitalist and communist blocs. Among the options provided, the most relevant is the competing ideologies of the Cold War, as this context directly relates to the non-alignment policy mentioned in the passage.

Answer: F
