Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about prisms and the angle of minimum deviation. Hmm, I remember that prisms are transparent optical elements with flat, polished surfaces that refract light. The angle of minimum deviation is the smallest angle at which a light beam bends when it passes through the prism. 

The problem says the prism has an apex angle of 72 degrees and a refractive index of 1.66. It's immersed in water, which has a refractive index of 1.33. I need to find the angle of minimum deviation from the given options.

Wait, I think the formula for the angle of minimum deviation (δm) for a prism is given by δm = (n_prism / n_medium - 1) * apex_angle / 2. Or was it something else? Maybe I should think more carefully.

Oh right, the formula is actually δm = ( (n2/n1) - 1 ) * (A/2), where A is the apex angle. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Because when the prism is in a medium, the formula changes a bit. Let me try to recall the correct formula.

I remember that when the prism is surrounded by a medium, the formula for minimum deviation becomes δ = (n2/n1 - 1) * (A/2). So here, n2 is the refractive index of the prism, and n1 is that of the surrounding medium, which is water in this case.

So plugging in the numbers: n2 is 1.66 and n1 is 1.33. The apex angle A is 72 degrees. 

Let me compute (n2/n1) first. 1.66 divided by 1.33. Let's see, 1.33 * 1.25 is 1.6625. Oh wait, 1.33 times 1.25 is indeed 1.6625, which is just a bit more than 1.66. So approximately, 1.66 / 1.33 ≈ 1.248. Let me calculate it more accurately. 1.66 / 1.33 = (1.66 * 100) / (1.33 * 100) )= 166/133. Let me do the division: 133 * 1.2 is 159.6. 166-159.6=6.4. So 6.4/133 is approximately 0.048. So total is approximately 1.248.

Then, (n2/n1 -1) is 1.248 - 1 = 0.248.

Now, multiply this by the apex angle divided by 2. The apex angle is 72 degrees, so 72/2 is 36 degrees. So 0.248 * 36 = ?

Calculating 0.248 * 36. Let's do 0.2 *36=7.2, 0.04*36=1.44, 0.008*36=0.288. Adding them up: 7.2+1.44=8.64 +0.288=8.928. So approximately 8.93 degrees. Wait, but wait, that's 8.93. But looking at the options, none are close to 8 degrees. The options are all in the 20s, 18, etc. So I'm definitely doing something wrong here.

Wait, maybe I got the formula wrong. Because when the prism is in a medium, the formula I'm thinking of might not be correct. Let me think again. Oh! I remember that the formula for minimum deviation when the prism is surrounded by a medium is different. The general formula is:

δm = ( (n2 - n1) / n1 ) * (A/2 )

Wait, no, that can't be right because n1 could be larger than n2, leading to negative angles, which doesn't make sense. Hmm.

Wait another approach: Snell's law. At minimum deviation, the light enters and exits the prism in a symmetrical way. So the angle of incidence at each face is equal. Let me draw a diagram mentally. The prism has an apex angle A, and when the light passes through it, it bends towards the normal upon entering, and again upon exiting.

But wait, the correct formula for the angle of minimum deviation (δm) when the prism is in a medium is:

δm = ( (n_prism / n_medium) - 1 ) * (A/2 )

Wait, that's what I did earlier, but the answer I got was 8.93 degrees, which doesn't match any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps I confused the formula. Maybe the correct formula is δm = (n2/n1 -1) * (A/2). So let's recalculate.

Wait, n2 is the prism's refractive index, 1.66, and n1 is the surrounding medium, 1.33. So n2/n1 is 1.66/1.33 ≈ 1.248. Then, 1.248 - 1 = 0.248. Multiply by A/2: 72/2=36. 0.248 *36=8.928, as before. So about 8.93 degrees. But the options don't have anything near 9 degrees. The closest is option J:20, but that's way higher. So I must have the wrong formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (n2 - n1)/n1 * (A/2) when the prism is in a medium. That would be (1.66 - 1.33)/1.33 * (72/2). Let's compute that: (0.33 /1.33) ) * 36. 0.33/1.33 is approximately 0.248, so 0.248 *36 is again 8.928. Same result.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe the formula is different. Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the deviation caused by a single surface, but for a prism, it's twice that.

Wait, the deviation for a single refraction at one face is (n2/n1)*sin(theta1) = sin(theta2). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, the formula for minimum deviation is when the light passes symmetrically through the prism, so the angle of incidence on each face is equal.

Wait, another approach: The angle of deviation for a prism is given by δ = (n2/n1 -1)*A, but that doesn't seem right. Because if A is 60 degrees, that would give a larger deviation. Hmm.

Wait, I think I'm mixing formulas. Let me get back to the basics. The formula for the angle of minimum deviation (δm) for a prism when surrounded by a medium with refractive index n1 is:

δm = 2 * ( arcsin( (n2/n1) * sin(A/2) ) - A/2 )

Wait, no, that's not right. Or perhaps, when dealing with a prism in a medium, the formula is more complex. I think I'm getting stuck because I can't recall the exact formula.

Wait, maybe I should think of it this way. The minimum deviation occurs when the incoming light is perpendicular to the plane of the prism's base. So the light strikes the prism symmetrically. So the formula for the deviation is:

δ = A + 2*(i - e)

Where i is the angle of incidence at the first face, and e is the angle of exit at the second face. But since it's symmetric, the angles of incidence at each face are the same.

Wait, no, the deviation is when the light enters and exits. So the deviation angle is the total change in direction. Let me try to model it.

When the light enters the first face, it bends towards the normal. Then, upon exiting the second face, it bends away from the normal (since it's going into a medium with lower refractive index if n2>n1). Wait, wait, the prism has a higher index than the surrounding medium (1.66 >1.33), so when light exits from the prism to water, it bends away from the normal.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to model using Snell's law for each surface.

Let me denote the apex angle as A=72 degrees. At minimum deviation, the incoming light is such that the angle of incidence on the first face is equal to the angle of exit on the second face. Wait, but I'm not sure.

Wait, when the prism is in a medium, the effective formula for minimum deviation can be derived. Let me try to derive it.

At minimum deviation, the light path is symmetrical. So the angle of incidence on the first face equals the angle of exit on the second face.

Wait, but since the prism is in a medium, the light first enters from medium to prism, then exits from prism to medium.

So for the first surface (medium to prism):

n1 * sin(theta1) = n2 * sin(theta2)

Theta1 is the angle of incidence, theta2 the angle inside the prism.

At the second surface (prism to medium):

n2 * sin(theta3) = n1 * sin(theta4)

But because of the prism's apex angle, the path inside the prism is such that the total deviation is considered.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the deviation when the prism is in a medium is:

δm = (n2/n1) * (A/2) ) 

But I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is δm = (n2 - n1) * (A/2) divided by some factor.

Wait, I think I remember now that when a prism is placed in a medium, the formula for the angle of minimum deviation is δm = (n2/n1 - 1) * (A/2). So let's test that.

n2=1.66, n1=1.33.

n2/n1 = 1.66/1.33 ≈ 1.248.

1.248 -1 = 0.248.

Multiply by (72/2)=36 degrees.

0.248 *36=8.928 degrees, approx 8.93 degrees.

But the options don't have anything close to that. The options start at 18 degrees. So I'm clearly missing something here.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up n1 and n2. What if n1 is the prism and n2 is the medium? No, that wouldn't make sense, because the prism has a higher index than the medium. So when light goes from medium to prism, it bends towards the normal.

Wait another thought: Maybe the formula is different, such as δm = (n1/n2 - 1) * (A/2) ?

Wait, n1 is 1.33, n2=1.66.

n1/n2=0.798.

0.798-1= -0.202. So that would give a negative angle, which doesn't make sense. So that can't be right.

Hmm, perhaps the formula is (n2 - n1)/n1 * (A/2). So (1.66 -1.33)/1.33=0.33/1.33≈0.248. Multiply by 36 (72/2)=8.93 degrees again.

Still same result. So maybe the formula is something else.

Wait, perhaps the angle of minimum deviation when in a medium is given by δm = ( (n2 - n1)/n1 ) * (A) ?

Wait, 0.33/1.33 *72 ≈ 0.248 *72= about 17.85 degrees. That's around 18 degrees. Oh! Option D is 18 degrees. Could that be the correct approach?

Wait, but why would the formula be (n2-n1)/n1 multiplied by the apex angle, not half? I thought the standard formula for a prism in air is δm = (n-1)*A/2, where n is the refractive index of the prism. So when it's in a medium, perhaps it's (n2-n1)/n1 * A/2. But in that case, it gives 8.93 degrees, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is (n2 - n1) * (A/2) divided by n1. So (0.33) *36 /1.33. 0.33 *36=11.88, divided by 1.33≈8.93. Again same result.

Wait, but 0.33 *72 =23.76. 23.76 divided by 1.33 is approx 17.85, which is about 18 degrees. That's option D.

But why would the formula be (n2 - n1)*A /n1 ?

Hmm, maybe I should think of it this way: The deviation when in a medium compared to in air. Because when the prism is in air, the deviation is (n2-1)*A/2. But when it's in another medium, perhaps it's (n2/n1 -1)*A/2, which is what I did earlier, getting ~8.93 degrees.

But that's not matching any options. So perhaps I'm using the wrong approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (n2 -n1) * (A/2). So 0.33 *36=11.88 degrees. Not matching any options.

Wait, but perhaps I need to consider that when the prism is in a medium, the effective apex angle changes? No, the apex angle is a physical property of the prism and doesn't change with the medium.

Another approach: Maybe the prism is made of a material with refractive index higher than the surrounding medium, so when light enters, it bends towards the normal, and when exiting, it bends away.

Wait, perhaps the minimum deviation formula for a prism in a medium is the same as when it's in air, except that n is replaced by (n2/n1). So the formula becomes δm = (n2/n1 -1) * (A/2).

Which brings me back to the 8.93 degrees. But the options don't include that. So perhaps the correct formula is different.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of relative refractive index. When the prism is in a medium, the effective refractive index is n2/n1.

So the deviation would be (n2/n1 - 1) * (A/2) = (1.66/1.33 -1) *36.

As before, 1.66/1.33 is approximately 1.248, so 0.248 *36=8.928, which is 8.93 degrees.

But again, no option matches. Maybe I'm missing a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, maybe the formula is (n2/n1 -1) * A instead of half. So 0.248 *72=17.856, which is ~17.86, close to 18 degrees (option D). But why would the formula be without the division by 2?

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me see the options again. The options are A:26, B:30, C:28, D:18, E:25, F:24.5, G:22.4, H:23, I:19.5, J:20.

If I calculate 17.85, it's close to 18, which is option D. But I thought the formula had a division by 2. So maybe the correct formula is (n2 -n1)/n1 * A, which gives 0.248 *72=17.85.

But I'm not sure why the division by 2 isn't there. Alternatively, perhaps I was mistaken about the formula, and the correct approach is indeed (n2 -n1)/n1 * A, which gives ~18 degrees.

Alternatively, perhaps I should just think about the deviation without the 2 factor. Maybe the formula is (n2 -n1) * (A/2). So 0.33 *36=11.88, which is not an option.

Hmm, but wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute delta as (n2/n1)* (A/2), but subtracting the original apex angle. No, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (n2/n1 -1) * (A/2) + something else. Or maybe it's (n2/n1) * (A/2) - (A/2), which would be (n2/n1 -1)*A/2, which brings me back again to 8.93.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is 22.4 degrees, which is option G. How would that happen?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recalculate 1.66 /1.33 exactly.

1.66 divided by 1.33.

1.33 times 1.25 is 1.6625, as I thought earlier. So 1.25 is 5/4. But 1.66 is 166/100, 1.33 is 133/100.

So 166/133 = (166 ÷ 133) = approximately 1.248.

So 1.248-1=0.248.

Multiply by 36: 0.248 *36.

Let me compute 36 *0.2=7.2, 36 *0.04=1.44, 36 *0.008=0.288. So 7.2+1.44=8.64 +0.288=8.928, which is approximately 8.93 degrees.

But that's not an option. So perhaps the formula is different.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the angle of minimum deviation when the prism is in a medium is:

δm = ( (n2 - n1)/n1 ) * (A) 

So (1.66-1.33)/1.33 *72 = 0.33/1.33 *72.

0.33/1.33 ≈ 0.248.

0.248 *72=17.856, which is approximately 17.86 degrees, so 18 degrees, option D.

So why would the formula be (n2-n1)/n1 * A? That would imply that the deviation increases with the apex angle, which makes sense. But earlier, I thought the formula was (n2/n1-1)*A/2.

Wait, perhaps I was mistaken. Maybe the correct formula is indeed (n2 -n1)/n1 * (A/2). Let me check that.

Wait, (1.66-1.33)=0.33. 0.33/(1.33) = 0.248. Multiply by (72/2)=36. 0.248 *36=8.928, as before.

So no, that doesn't give option D.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (n2/n1) * (A/2) - (A/2), which is (n2/n1 -
