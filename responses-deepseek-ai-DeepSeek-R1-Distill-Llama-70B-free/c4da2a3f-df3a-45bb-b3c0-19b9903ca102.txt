Question:

Is TNC a new phenomenon?

Options:

A: There is little evidence to substantiate the claim that there is a real and increasing threat posed by the scale and scope of transnational crime in the 1980s to 1990s beyond the consensus that concern over the levels of crime were generated by the military re-conceiving its role in light of the dissolution of the Cold War.
B: Whereas illegal markets were territorially bounded and isolated in the past, the contemporary form illicit markets tend to be interrelated and mutually supporting and more embedded in the legal economy.
C: TNC is a response by the dispossessed in response to the asymmetric economic development of nation states and the inequity of global market capitalism married with environmental constraints on development.
D: Transnational crime is no longer the exclusive domain of certain geographic areas or ethnic groups becoming globalized in operation, increasing the number of groups and countries affected and increasing the size of the illegal market ratio to licit trade.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out whether TNC (Transnational Crime) is a new phenomenon. Let me think about each of the options given and see which one makes the most sense.

First, I'll recall what I know about transnational crime. From what I remember, transnational crime refers to criminal activities that cross national borders. This includes things like drug trafficking, human trafficking, arms dealing, and cybercrime. These activities have been around for a long time, but maybe their scale or nature has changed recently.

Looking at the options:

Option A: It says there's little evidence that TNC was a real and increasing threat in the 80s and 90s beyond the military redefining its role post-Cold War. So this suggests that the perception of TNC as a growing threat might not be based on actual increases but rather on changing priorities after the Cold War ended. That's an interesting point because after the Cold War, many militaries and governments might have shifted their focus to other issues, making TNC seem more prominent even if it wasn't necessarily growing.

Option B: This option talks about illegal markets being more interconnected and embedded in the legal economy now than in the past. So historically, illegal markets were isolated and territorial, but now they're more global and integrated. This implies that TNC isn't new, but its structure and reach have evolved. If that's the case, then TNC isn't a new phenomenon but has changed in how it operates.

Option C: This suggests that TNC arises from economic inequalities and environmental constraints. It's about the dispossessed responding to unfair global markets. This is more about the causes of TNC rather than whether it's new. So while this explains why TNC exists, it doesn't directly address if it's a recent development.

Option D: This states that TNC is no longer limited to certain areas or groups and has become globalized. It's affecting more groups and countries, and the illegal market's size relative to legal trade is increasing. This would mean that while TNC might have existed before, its scope and impact have expanded, making it a more significant issue now.

Now, the question is whether TNC is a new phenomenon. So if the question is about whether TNC is new, then options that discuss its recent growth or changes would be relevant.

Option A suggests that the threat wasn't real and increasing, which would mean TNC isn't new but perhaps the perception is. Option D says TNC has become more globalized, indicating it's an old issue that's expanded. Option B talks about changes in how illegal markets operate now compared to the past, implying that the nature of TNC has evolved but isn't new.

Wait, the question is whether TNC is a new phenomenon. So if the correct answer is that it's not new, then options A, B, or D might support that.

But looking at each option again: Option D says that TNC is becoming globalized, which suggests it's not new but has spread. Similarly, B talks about changes in the structure of markets, not the emergence of TNC as a new thing.

Option A, on the other hand, is about the perception in the 80s-90s. It argues that the idea of TNC as a growing threat isn't backed by evidence beyond the military's shift. So that would mean that TNC wasn't actually new then, just that the focus changed.

Putting it together, if the question is whether TNC is new, the answer would be that it's not. So the correct option would be the one that shows TNC has been around but perhaps has changed in scope or structure.

Wait, looking again: the question is whether TNC is a new phenomenon. So which options say it's not new?

Option B: "contemporary form...tend to be interrelated", so now they are more connected than before. That suggests that the structure changed, so maybe TNC existed but is now more integrated.

Option D: says TNC is no longer exclusive to certain areas. So before, it was limited, but now it's more widespread. So TNC has been around but expanded.

Option A: says the threat wasn't increasing, so maybe TNC wasn't new but just perceived as such.

So the options that indicate TNC isn't new are B and D, and A suggests it's not new because the threat wasn't real.

The question is asking if TNC is a new phenomenon. So the correct answer would be that it's not new, but perhaps the scale or interconnectedness has changed.

Wait, the question is whether TNC is new. So if the answer is no, then which option supports that.

Option D says TNC is becoming globalized, implying it's been around but now is more widespread. So that would mean it's not a new phenomenon.

Option B says that now markets are more interconnected, but that doesn't directly say whether TNC is new. It just says the structure changed.

Option A is about the 80s-90s and says the threat wasn't real, so that would mean that TNC wasn't new even then.

But the question is general, not about a specific time.

So I think the best answer is D because it says that TNC is no longer limited geographically or ethnically and is becoming more global, which suggests it's not new but has expanded.

Wait, but the question is whether it's a new phenomenon. So if D says it's becoming globalized, that's a change, but does that mean it's new? Or that it's an expansion of an existing issue.

I think the answer is D, because it says that TNC is no longer limited, implying it's been around but now operates more globally. So TNC isn't new.

Alternatively, option B says that markets are now more integrated, which is a change from the past, so maybe TNC has evolved but isn't new.

Wait, but the options are statements about whether TNC is new. So which option indicates that it's not new.

Option A says that the idea of TNC as a growing threat in the 80s-90s isn't supported, implying that maybe the perception was new but the actuality wasn't.

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. 

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B, because it suggests that the structure has changed over time, indicating that TNC has been around but is now more integrated.

Wait, but the question is whether TNC is new. If B is talking about the current structure, then it's not about being new, but about how it's changed.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is D, because it's saying that TNC has spread and is now global, which might suggest that it's a more recent development, making it a new phenomenon in terms of its global reach.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think of it differently.

The question is whether TNC is a new phenomenon. If the answer is no, then the correct statement would indicate that TNC has existed before but perhaps has changed in scale or form.

Option D says that TNC is no longer the exclusive domain of certain areas or groups and has become globalized. So that suggests that TNC is not new but has spread, making it more widespread.

Option A suggests that the perceived threat increase wasn't real, but that doesn't directly say whether TNC is new or not.

Option B talks about markets being more interconnected now, which is a change but doesn't directly address the newness.

Option C is about the causes, not the timing.

So I think the correct answer is D because it directly addresses that TNC has become more globalized, implying that it's an existing phenomenon that has expanded.

To determine whether Transnational Crime (TNC) is a new phenomenon, it is important to analyze the options provided:

- **Option A** suggests that the perceived increase in TNC as a threat in the 1980s and 1990s was not substantiated by evidence and was instead linked to the military's redefinition of its role post-Cold War. This implies that TNC was not new during that period but was perceived as such due to shifting priorities.

- **Option B** highlights that contemporary illicit markets are more interconnected and embedded in the legal economy compared to the past, when they were territorially bounded and isolated. This indicates that while the structure and integration of TNC have evolved, it is not a new phenomenon.

- **Option C** focuses on the causes of TNC, such as economic inequality and environmental constraints, but does not directly address whether TNC is new.

- **Option D** states that TNC is no longer confined to specific geographic areas or ethnic groups and has become globalized, affecting more groups and countries. This suggests that TNC is not new but has expanded in scope and reach over time.

Given the question of whether TNC is a new phenomenon, the key is to identify the option that best indicates TNC's historical presence and evolution. **Option D** clearly shows that TNC has existed but has become more globalized, making it the most appropriate answer.
