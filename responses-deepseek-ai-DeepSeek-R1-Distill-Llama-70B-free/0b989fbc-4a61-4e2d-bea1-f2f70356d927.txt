Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Aquinas's natural law theory and intrinsic goods. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

Alright, the question is asking which of the options is a basic intrinsic good according to Aquinas. The options are A: human life, B: human procreation, C: human sociability, and D: all of the above.

From what I remember, Aquinas, being a Scholastic theologian and philosopher, developed a natural law theory that's based on the concept of human nature and the inherent inclinations that guide us towards certain goods. These goods are considered intrinsic because they're good in themselves and contribute to human flourishing.

So, I think he talks about three primary inclinations. The first is towards the preservation of life, which would relate to human life. Then, there's the inclination towards sexual intercourse, which is about procreation. The third is about the inclination to live in society, which ties into sociability. 

Wait, so each of these—life, procreation, and sociability—would be considered basic intrinsic goods. That makes sense because they're fundamental aspects of human nature. Life is essential for existence, procreation ensures the continuation of the species, and sociability allows humans to live together and form communities, which are necessary for a full life.

So if all three are basic intrinsic goods, the correct answer would be D: all of the above. But I should make sure I'm not mixing this up with other theories. I think in natural law theory, especially Aquinas's, these three are indeed the primary goods. 

Wait, another thought—sometimes people might confuse intrinsic goods with other concepts. But no, intrinsic goods are those ends which are sought for their own sake, not as a means to another end. So human life, procreation, and sociability fit because they're ends in themselves and part of what it means to be human.

I don't think Aquinas would exclude any of these. So yeah, the answer should include all three, making option D the correct choice.

According to Aquinas's natural law theory, basic intrinsic goods are those ends that are sought for their own sake and are essential for human flourishing. These include the preservation of human life, human procreation, and human sociability. Each of these is fundamental to human nature and contributes inherently to a fulfilling life. Therefore, all three—human life, human procreation, and human sociability—are considered basic intrinsic goods.

Answer: D
