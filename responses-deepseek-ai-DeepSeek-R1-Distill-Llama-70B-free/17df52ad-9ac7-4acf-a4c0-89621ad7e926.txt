Okay, so I've got this question about programmed decisions, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that in management and decision-making, decisions are often categorized into two types: programmed and non-programmed. Programmed decisions are the routine, repetitive ones that happen regularly in an organization. They're usually handled by following established procedures or rules. For example, things like handling customer complaints in a standard way or processing payroll each month would fall into this category.

On the other hand, non-programmed decisions are more complex and unusual. These are the one-off situations where there's no established procedure, so the manager has to think through each case from scratch. These are often high-stakes and require more time and analysis. An example might be deciding whether to launch a new product line or enter a new market.

So the question is asking about the characteristics of a programmed decision. Let's look at the options provided.

Option A: Uncertain and low risk. Hmm, I don't think so. Programmed decisions are usually certain because they follow known procedures. Uncertainty is more for non-programmed.

Option B: Non-routine and complex. No, that's the opposite. Programmed are routine, so B is probably non-programmed.

Option C: Low risk and certain. This sounds right. Programmed decisions are routine, so the outcomes are more certain and the risks are lower because they're based on established methods.

Option D: High risk and uncertain. Definitely not. High risk and uncertainty are for non-programmed.

Option E: Uncertain and non-routine. Again, this sounds like non-programmed.

Option F: Risky and routine. Risky doesn't fit because routine decisions are lower risk.

Option G: Complex and risky. No, that's non-programmed.

Option H: Certain and complex. Complexity is more for non-programmed, so H is incorrect.

Option I: Complex and certain. Again, complexity doesn't fit programmed.

Option J: Routine and non-complex. Routine fits, but non-complex? Well, programmed are routine and typically not complex. So J could be a possibility, but let me think.

Wait, the key points about programmed decisions are that they are routine, repetitive, and low risk with certain outcomes. So looking at the options, option C says "Low risk and certain" which matches. Option J says "Routine and non-complex," which is also correct in terms of routine but doesn't address risk and certainty.

So the question is asking what characterizes a programmed decision. Both C and J have correct aspects, but the question is about the combination of factors.

Wait, another approach: programmed decisions are made under conditions of certainty because the outcomes are known and the solution is standard. They are routine, so low risk is implied. So option C says low risk and certain, which fits.

Alternatively, option J says routine and non-complex. But the question asks for characteristics, so both aspects (routine and risk/certainty) might be covered by C and J. But I'm a bit confused because I thought programmed decisions are routine and low risk, but what about complexity? Programmed decisions are not complex because they follow known procedures.

So looking again, the options are:

C: Low risk and certain.

J: Routine and non-complex.

The question asks for characteristics, so both might be correct, but the options are given as separate choices. So which one is more accurate?

In the context of decision types, the primary distinction is between programmed (routine, repetitive, certain, low risk) and non-programmed (non-routine, complex, uncertain, high risk). So the key characteristics of programmed would include being routine (so J includes routine) and certain with low risk (so C includes that).

But the options are individual; each option is a pair. So which pair correctly describes programmed decisions?

Option C: low risk and certain. That's correct.

Option J: routine and non-complex. Also correct.

Wait, but the question might be testing on both aspects. So the correct answer would be either C or J, depending on what's expected.

Wait, another angle: in the context of the question, what's the exact definition? Programmed decisions are routine, repetitive, and typically have established procedures. So they are routine (so J's first part is right), and because they are routine, the outcomes are more certain and the risk is lower.

So looking at the options, both C and J have correct points. But each option is a pair. The question is, which pair correctly describes a programmed decision.

Hmm. Let me think again. Programmed decisions are routine and repetitive, so they are handled by standard procedures. That makes them low risk and certain in their outcomes because you know what to expect when you follow the procedure. So the characteristics are low risk and certain.

So option C is correct. Option J says routine and non-complex, which is also correct, but perhaps the key factors the question is testing are risk and certainty.

Wait, the original question is multiple choice, and only one option is correct. So I need to choose between C and J.

Wait, another thought: in management theory, programmed decisions are associated with low risk and being routine. So the primary characteristics are routine, low risk, certain.

So I think the correct answer is C: Low risk and certain.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option J says "Routine and non-complex." That's also correct because programmed decisions are routine and not complex. So why are both C and J correct? Or am I misunderstanding?

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is J. Because the question may be focusing on the routine and complexity aspects. But I'm getting a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is J, because programmed decisions are routine (so that's one point), and non-complex (so not complex, hence the second point). So J would be the correct option.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to outline:

Programmed decisions:

- Routine (so J's first part is correct)
- Repetitive
- Use established procedures
- Made under certainty
- Low risk
- Not complex

Non-programmed:

- Non-routine
- Complex
- High risk
- Uncertain
- Unique

So, the characteristics of programmed are routine, low risk, certain, and non-complex.

So looking at the options, J is Routine and non-complex. C is Low risk and certain.

The question is asking for characteristics. So both C and J are correct in their respective pairs.

Wait, but the options are separate. So which pair is correct as the answer?

I think the standard teaching is that programmed decisions are routine, repetitive, low risk, certain, non-complex. So the correct option would have both low risk and certain (option C) or routine and non-complex (option J).

But since the question asks for "characteristics," I think either could be correct, but perhaps the more directly relevant ones are low risk and certain because they pertain to the decision's nature, while routine is more about frequency.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option C: Low risk and certain.

But I'm a bit torn. Another approach: the question might be from a specific textbook or framework. For example, in Herbert Simon's work, he distinguishes between programmed and non-programmed decisions. Programmed are routine, repetitive, and can be handled by established rules. So they are low risk and certain.

So I think the answer is C: Low risk and certain.

Alternatively, if the question emphasizes routine and non-complex, then J is correct.

Wait, but the options don't combine all four aspects. So which pair is more directly associated with programmed decisions?

I think the key is that programmed decisions are made with certainty, as they follow known procedures, so the outcome is predictable. So they are certain and low risk. So option C is correct.

Programmed decisions are routine, repetitive, and follow established procedures, making them low risk and certain in their outcomes. They are handled using standard methods, and their results are predictable. In contrast, non-programmed decisions are non-routine, complex, and involve higher risk and uncertainty. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A, D, E, G**: These involve uncertainty or high risk, which are characteristics of non-programmed decisions, not programmed ones.
- **B, H, I**: These describe complexity, which is more associated with non-programmed decisions.
- **C**: "Low risk and certain" aligns with the characteristics of programmed decisions, as they are repetitive and follow established procedures, leading to predictable outcomes.
- **J**: "Routine and non-complex" is also correct, as programmed decisions are routine and not complex. However, the question emphasizes characteristics like risk and certainty, which are more directly addressed by option C.

While both C and J have correct aspects, the key characteristics of programmed decisions—low risk and certainty—are best captured by option C.
