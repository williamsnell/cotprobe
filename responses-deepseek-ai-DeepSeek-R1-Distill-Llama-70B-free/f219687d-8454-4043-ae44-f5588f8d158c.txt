Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the average atomic weight of natural sulfur. Hmm, I remember that the average atomic weight is calculated based on the natural abundance of each isotope, right? So each isotope contributes its own mass multiplied by its abundance percentage.

The question gives me four isotopes of sulfur with their respective abundances and masses. Let me list them out:

- 10S^22: 95.0% abundance, mass 31.97207 u
- 10S^23: 0.76% abundance, mass 32.97146 u
- 10S^24: 4.22% abundance, mass 33.96786 u
- 10S^26: 0.02% abundance, mass 35.96709 u

Wait, I should make sure the abundances add up to 100%. Let me check: 95 + 0.76 is 95.76, plus 4.22 is 99.98, plus 0.02 makes exactly 100%, so that's correct.

The formula for average atomic weight is the sum of (abundance fraction * atomic mass) for each isotope. So I need to convert the percentages to fractions by dividing by 100.

Let me compute each term:

First isotope: (95.0/100) * 31.97207 = 0.95 * 31.97207. Let me calculate that. 0.95 * 32 is approximately 30.4, but let's be precise. 31.97207 * 0.95. Hmm, 31.97207 * 0.95: Let me compute 31.97207 * 0.95. 31.97207 * 1 is 31.97207, so 0.95 is 31.97207 - (31.97207 * 0.05). 0.05 of 31.97207 is about 1.5986035. So 31.97207 - 1.5986035 = 30.3734565.

Wait, maybe I should just multiply directly. 31.97207 * 0.95. Let me compute 31.97207 * 95 = ?

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute each step:

31.97207 * 0.95 = (31.97207 * 1) - (31.97207 * 0.05).

31.97207 * 0.05 is 1.5986035. So 31.97207 - 1.5986035 is 30.3734565 u.

Second isotope: 0.76% is 0.0076 in fraction. Multiply by 32.97146.

So 0.0076 * 32.97146. Let me compute that. 32.97146 * 0.0076. Hmm, 32.97146 * 0.007 is approximately 0.2308, and 0.0006 *32.97146 is about 0.0198. So adding those, 0.2308 + 0.0198 = 0.2506. Wait, but wait, maybe I should do it more accurately.

Alternatively, 0.0076 * 32.97146 = ?

Let me compute 32.97146 * 76 * 1e-4.

76 * 32.97146 = let's compute 70 *32.97146 = 2308.002; 6*32.97146= 197.82876. So total 2308.002 +197.82876 =2505.83076. Now multiply by 1e-4: 2505.83076 * 1e-4 = 0.250583076 u. So approximately 0.250583 u.

Third isotope: 4.22% is 0.0422. Multiply by 33.96786.

0.0422 * 33.96786. Let's compute that.

Hmm, 33.96786 *0.04 is 1.3589144. 33.96786 *0.0022 = let's see, 33.96786 *0.002=0.06793572; 33.96786 *0.0002=0.006793572. So 0.06793572 +0.006793572=0.074729292. So total is 1.3589144 + 0.074729292 ≈ 1.43364369 u.

Wait, but wait, 0.04 is 4%, and 0.0022 is 0.22%, so 4.22% is 0.0422. So 0.0422 *33.96786 = ?

An alternative way: 33.96786 * 0.04 =1.3589144. 33.96786 * 0.0022 = 0.074729292. So sum is 1.3589144+0.074729292=1.43364369 u.

Fourth isotope: 0.02% is 0.0002. Multiply by 35.96709.

So 0.0002 *35.96709 = 0.007193418 u.

Now, sum all four contributions.

First: 30.3734565 u

Second: 0.250583076 u

Third: 1.43364369 u

Fourth: 0.007193418 u

Let me add them step by step.

30.3734565 + 0.250583076 = 30.624039576

30.624039576 +1.43364369 = 32.057683266

32.057683266 + 0.007193418 = 32.064876684 u

Wait, so the average atomic weight is approximately 32.064876684 u. Now, looking at the options, let's see:

Option B is 32.06469 u

Option H is 32.06540 u.

Wait, my calculation is approximately 32.06488, which is around 32.0649. Let me check the options again.

Option B: 32.06469 u

Option H is 32.06540 u.

Wait, so which is closer? Let me compute precisely.

Wait, perhaps I made a rounding error in the calculations. Maybe I should be more precise.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute each term with more precision.

Let me recompute each term more accurately.

First term: 0.95 *31.97207 = ?

31.97207 * 0.95

Calculate 31.97207 * 95 = ?

Wait, 31.97207 *95 = ?

Hmm, 31.97207 * 95 = 31.97207 * (100-5) = 3197.207 - (31.97207 *5).

31.97207 *5 = 159.86035.

So 3197.207 -159.86035 = 3037.34665.

Now, multiply by 1e-2 because 95 is 95/100, so 0.95.

3037.34665 * 1e-2 = 30.3734665 u.

So first term is 30.3734665.

Second term: 0.76% is 0.0076. 32.97146 *0.0076.

Compute 32.97146 * 0.0076:

0.0076 is 76e-4.

32.97146 *76 = ?

32 *76 = 2432.

0.97146 *76 = let's compute that.

0.9 *76 = 68.4

0.07146 *76 = approx 5.43096.

So 68.4 +5.43096=73.83096.

So 32.97146 *76 = (32*76) + (0.97146*76) = 2432 +73.83096 = 2505.83096.

Multiply by 1e-4: 2505.83096 *1e-4 = 0.250583096 u.

So second term is 0.250583096 u.

Third term: 4.22% is 0.0422. 33.96786 *0.0422.

Compute 33.96786 *0.0422.

Let me compute 33.96786 * 0.04 = 1.3589144.

33.96786 *0.0022 = ?

Compute 33.96786 *0.002 = 0.06793572.

33.96786 *0.0002=0.006793572.

So 0.06793572 +0.006793572 = 0.074729292.

So 0.04 *33.96786=1.3589144; 0.0022*33.96786=0.074729292.

Adding these gives 1.3589144 +0.074729292 = 1.433643692 u.

Fourth term: 0.02% is 0.0002. 35.96709 *0.0002 = 0.007193418 u.

Now sum all four terms accurately:

30.3734665 + 0.250583096 = 30.624049596.

30.624049596 +1.433643692 = 32.057693288.

32.057693288 +0.007193418 = 32.064886706 u.

So the exact calculated average is approximately 32.064886706 u.

Looking at the options:

Option B is 32.06469 u.

Option H is 32.06540 u.

Wait, let me see which is closer. 32.0648867 is approximately 32.064887.

Option B is 32.06469, which is 0.0002 less.

Option H is 32.06540, which is 0.0005 higher.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recheck the third term.

Wait, third term: 4.22% of 33.96786.

33.96786 * 0.0422.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

33.96786 * 0.0422.

Let me compute 33.96786 * 422 = ?

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 33.96786 * 0.04 = 1.3589144.

33.96786 * 0.0022 = ?

Compute 33.96786 * 0.002 = 0.06793572.

33.96786 * 0.0002 = 0.006793572.

So 0.0022 is 0.002 + 0.0002, so 0.06793572 + 0.006793572 = 0.074729292.

So 0.0422 = 0.04 + 0.0022, so 1.3589144 + 0.074729292 =1.433643692.

Yes, that's correct.

So sum is 32.0648867 u.

Looking at the options, the closest is option B:32.06469, which is 32.06469 u.

The difference between our calculated value and option B is 32.0648867 -32.06469 = 0.0001967, which is 0.0002 approximately. So perhaps the exact calculation is needed.

Alternatively, maybe the precise calculation needs to carry more decimal points.

Wait, perhaps I'll compute each multiplication without intermediate rounding.

First term: 0.95 *31.97207 = ?

31.97207 * 0.95.

Compute 31.97207 * 95 = ?

31.97207 * 95 = ?

Compute step by step:

31.97207 * 90 = 287.48623

31.97207 *5 = 159.86035

Sum: 287.48623 +159.86035 = 447.34658.

Divide by 100 (since 0.95 is 95/100) → 4.4734658? Wait no, 95 is 95/100 → 0.95.

Wait, 31.97207 *0.95 = (31.97207 *95) / 100.

So 31.97207 *95 = 31.97207 * (90 +5) = (31.97207 *90) + (31.97207 *5).

31.97207 *90: 31.97207 *9 = 287.74863 → 287.74863 *10 = 2874.7863.

Wait, no: 31.97207 *90 = 31.97207 *9 *10.

31.97207 *9: 31.97207 *9 = 287.74863. Multiply by 10 → 2874.7863.

31.97207 *5 = 159.86035.

Sum: 2874.7863 +159.86035 = 3034.64665.

Divide by 100 → 30.3464665 u.

Wait, but earlier I had 30.3734665. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Wait, let me recalculate.

Wait, 31.97207 * 95 → 31.97207 *95:

Calculate 31.97207 * 95:

Calculate 31.97207 * 100 = 3197.207.

Subtract 31.97207 *5 =159.86035.

So 3197.207 -159.86035 = 3037.34665.

Then 0.95 is 95/100 → 3037.34665 /100 =30.3734665 u.

Ah, right, I think I miscalculated earlier when I tried another approach. So the first term is 30.3734665 u.

Second term: 0.0076 *32.97146 = ?

32.97146 *0.0076 = ?

Compute 32.97146 *76 = ?

32 *76 = 2432.

0.97146 *76: 0.9 *76=68.4; 0.07146 *76=5.43096 → sum 73.83096.

Total 2432 +73.83096 =2505.83096.

Multiply by 1e-4 → 0.250583096 u.

Third term: 0.0422 *33.96786 = ?

33.96786 *0.0422 = ?

We'll compute 33.96786 *0.04 =1.3589144.

33.96786 *0.0022 = ?

33.96786 *0.002=0.06793572.

33.96786 *0.0002=0.006793572.

Sum 0.06793572 +0.006793572 =0.074729292.

So 0.04 is 1.3589144, 0.0022 is 0.074729292. Sum →1.3589144 +0.074729292 =1.433643692 u.

Fourth term: 0.0002 *35.96709 =0.007193418 u.

Now, sum all four:

30.3734665 +0.250583096 =30.624049596.

30.624049596 +1.433643692 =32.057693288.

32.057693288 +0.007193418 =32.064886706 u.

So the average is 32.064886706 u.

Looking at the options:

Option B: 32.06469 u → 32.06469

Option H: 32.06540 u → 32.06540

Which is closer?

32.0648867 is between 32.06469 and 32.06540.

Compute the differences:

32.0648867 -32.06469 = 0.0001967.

32.06540 -32.0648867 =0.0005133.

So option B is closer by 0.0001967, and option H is 0.0005133 away. So B is better.

But wait, let me check if perhaps the calculation is supposed to round to more decimal places.

Alternatively, perhaps when I added the terms, I should carry more precise numbers.

Wait, let me recheck the addition:

30.3734665 +0.250583096 =30.624049596.

Adding 1.433643692 to that gives 30.624049596 +1.433643692 =32.057693288.

Then add 0.007193418: 32.057693288 +0.007193418 =32.064886706.

So the precise sum is 32.064886706 u.

Looking at the options, the closest is option B (32.06469) and option H (32.06540).

Wait, perhaps the exact sum is 32.0648867, which is 32.064887 when rounded to six decimal places.

Looking at the options, option B is 32.06469. Let me count the decimal places:

32.06469 has five decimal places. Option B is 32.06469, which is 32.064690 when considering six decimals.

The calculated value is 32.0648867.

So the difference between option B and calculated is 32.0648867 -32.064690 = 0.0001967.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are rounded to five decimal places, so the correct average would be 32.06489, which would round to 32.06489. But none of the options have that.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option B: 32.06469 u

Option H: 32.06540 u

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck each term.

First term: 95% of 31.97207.

0.95 *31.97207 = 30.3734665 u.

Second term: 0.76% of 32.97146 → 0.0076 *32.97146 =0.250583096 u.

Third term:4.22% of 33.96786 →0.0422 *33.96786 =1.433643692 u.

Fourth term:0.02% of 35.96709 →0.0002*35.96709=0.007193418 u.

Sum: 30.3734665 +0.250583096 =30.624049596.

30.624049596 +1.433643692 =32.057693288.

32.057693288 +0.007193418 =32.064886706 u.

Yes, that's correct.

So in the options, the closest number is option B:32.06469.

Wait, but let me check if perhaps the exact sum is 32.06469 when considering rounding at each step.

Wait, perhaps the exact value is 32.0648867. So when rounded to five decimal places, it
