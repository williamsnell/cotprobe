Okay, so I've got this question about the Pleistocene era and some landmasses. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. So the question says that towards the end of the Pleistocene, between 28,000 and 18,000 years ago, sea levels were much lower, exposing a landmass east of Siberia. And then it's asking for the name of that landmass and the period it's called.

Wait, I remember that during ice ages, a lot of water gets locked up in glaciers, so sea levels drop. That exposes land bridges. The most famous one I know is the Bering Land Bridge, which connected present-day Russia and Alaska. So east of Siberia would be that area, right? So the landmass is probably Beringia.

Now, the periods. The Pleistocene epoch had several glacial periods. The last major one is often called the Last Glacial Maximum, I think. Or maybe the Late Glacial Maximum? Or was it the Last Glacial Period? I'm a bit confused. Let me try to recall. The Last Glacial Maximum refers to the time when the ice sheets were at their maximum extent, which was around 20,000 years ago. So between 28k and 18k years ago would include that period. Alternatively, the term Last Glacial Period might be the entire period of the last ice age, which would cover from about 110,000 to 10,000 years ago.

Wait, the question is about the time between 28k and 18k years ago, which is towards the end of the Pleistocene. So that's the latter part of the last ice age. The term for that specific time is the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), which occurred roughly 26.5k to 19k years ago. So that fits within the 28k to 18k window.

So putting it together, the landmass is Beringia, and the period is the Late Glacial Maximum? Wait, no. Wait, the LGM is a specific time, but I think the period is called the Last Glacial Period, or maybe Late Glacial. Hmm. Or perhaps the Beringian Period?

Wait, looking back at the options. Option B says Beringia; Late Glacial Maximum. Option G says Beringia; Last Glacial Period. Option J is Beringia; McKenzie Maximum, which I don't think is right. McKenzie Maximum sounds unfamiliar.

Wait, what are the options again? Let me recap:

A: Beringia; Late Beringian Period
B: Beringia; Late Glacial Maximum
C: Sundaland; Late Laurentide Period
D: Wallacea; McKenzie Maximum
E: Wallacea; Late Glacial Maximum
F: Wallacea; Late Laurentide Period
G: Beringia; Last Glacial Period
H: Sundaland; Late Beringian Period
I: Sundaland; McKenzie Maximum
J: Beringia; McKenzie Maximum

So the landmass is definitely Beringia, so the possible answers are A, B, G, J. Now the periods. The LGM is a part of the Last Glacial Period. So the time frame given, 28k to 18k, is during the Last Glacial Period, and includes the LGM.

Wait, no. The Last Glacial Period is the entire period, but the LGM is the peak. So the question is referring to the period when sea levels were lower, which would be the LGM. So the period's name would be the Late Glacial Maximum, I think. But wait, sometimes I've heard it called the Last Glacial Maximum.

Wait, but I think the correct term is Last Glacial Maximum, not Late Glacial Maximum. Or perhaps Late Glacial Maximum is another term. Maybe I'm mixing up the two.

Wait, the Late Glacial period would be the end of the last ice age, after the LGM. So from about 14,000 to 11,500 years ago. So the LGM is around 20,000 years ago. So the time between 28k and 18k would cover the LGM, which was around 20k. So the period is the Last Glacial Maximum.

But looking at the options, option B is Beringia; Late Glacial Maximum. Option G is Beringia; Last Glacial Period.

Wait, the Last Glacial Period is the entire period of the last ice age, while the LGM is a specific time within that. So the question is asking for the period when the sea levels were lower, which is the LGM. But none of the options for Beringia have Last Glacial Maximum except option B and G is Last Glacial Period.

Wait, the question says "this period is called the _______." So the period from 28k to 18k would be part of the Last Glacial Period, but the maximum was at the LGM within that. So possibly, the period is the Last Glacial Period, which would make the answer option G.

Wait, no. Because the Last Glacial Period is a longer time frame, from about 110,000 to 10,000 years ago. But the specific time when sea levels were at their lowest (exposing Beringia) was the LGM, which is a part of the Last Glacial Period. So the question is about the period when this occurred, which is the Last Glacial Maximum. So the period name would be the Last Glacial Maximum, but looking at the options, B says Late Glacial Maximum.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

In geological terms, the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) refers to the most recent time when ice sheets were at their maximum extent, which was approximately 26,500 to 19,000 years ago. So that fits within the 28k-18k range given. So the period is the Last Glacial Maximum, but I don't see an option that says that exactly.

Wait, the options: option B is Late Glacial Maximum, option G is Last Glacial Period.

Wait, perhaps the term used in the options is "Late Glacial Maximum" as another name for the LGM. Or perhaps the term in the options is "Last Glacial Period" which refers to the entire period, but the event in question is the LGM. But the question is a bit ambiguous.

Wait, the question says "this period is called the _______." So the period being referred to is the time when sea levels were low, so the LGM. So the correct term would be Last Glacial Maximum. But in the options, the closest is B: Late Glacial Maximum. Alternatively, perhaps the second part is the Last Glacial Period, which is the entire period, and within that is the LGM.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the terminology. The Last Glacial Period (LGP) is the most recent glacial period, part of the Pleistocene. The Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) is the point of maximum ice extent, around 20k years ago. So the period when the land was exposed (28k to 18k) includes the LGM, so the period is the LGP, but the maximum occurred during that.

But the question is about the period name. So perhaps the two blanks are the landmass and the period, which would be the Last Glacial Period, making the answer G: Beringia; Last Glacial Period.

Wait, no, because the exposure of Beringia happened during the LGM, which is within the LGP. So the period is the LGP, but the event is the LGM. But the question is asking for the period, not the event.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is B: Beringia; Late Glacial Maximum. Because the maximum exposure of land would be during the LGM.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of the options again. The landmass east of Siberia is Beringia. So options A, B, G, J. The second part is the period.

I think the correct term is the Last Glacial Maximum, but the options don't have that as an exact match. Option B says Late Glacial Maximum. So perhaps that's acceptable as a synonym.

Alternatively, option G says Last Glacial Period, which is the broader period encompassing the LGM.

Wait, the question states "toward the end of the Pleistocene, between 28,000 and 18,000 years ago". The Last Glacial Period ended around 10,000 years ago, so 18,000 is still within it. So the period is the Last Glacial Period. But the specific time when sea levels were lowest was the LGM, which is a part of that period.

So the first blank is Beringia, the second is Last Glacial Period, which is option G.

Wait, but I thought the LGM was the time when sea levels were lowest, so the period when the landmass was exposed would be the LGM. So the answer would be B: Beringia; Late Glacial Maximum.

Alternatively, maybe I'm wrong, and the period is called the Last Glacial Period. Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I should recall that the term "Late Glacial" refers to the period after the LGM, leading up to the Holocene. So the time around 28k-18k would be the LGM, and the period is called the Last Glacial Maximum. But the options don't have that exact wording. So perhaps the correct answer is B: Beringia; Late Glacial Maximum.

Alternatively, maybe the term is just Last Glacial Period, which is option G.

Wait, another approach: the Bering Land Bridge is associated with the last ice age, so the period is the Last Glacial Period. Therefore, the answer would be G.

But wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of what I learned before. The exposure of Beringia occurred during the last ice age when sea levels were low. The last ice age is known as the Pleistocene glaciation, and the specific period when the ice was at its maximum is the Last Glacial Maximum.

So the period mentioned in the question (28k-18k years ago) includes the LGM, which was around 20k. So the period is the Last Glacial Maximum. But the options for Beringia include "Late Glacial Maximum" and "Last Glacial Period".

Wait, maybe "Late Glacial Maximum" is another term for LGM. So perhaps option B is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the terms. The Last Glacial Period (LGP) is the entire period, which includes the LGM. So the time frame of 28k to 18k is part of LGP, but the maximum was during that time.

Wait, the question says the period is called the _______. So the period when sea levels were lower is the Last Glacial Period, which is option G. So the answer would be G: Beringia; Last Glacial Period.

But then why is there an option B that says Late Glacial Maximum? Did I mix up the terms?

Alternatively, perhaps the period is called the Late Glacial Maximum. But I thought the LGM is a specific time within the LGP.

Wait, perhaps the term 'Late Glacial Maximum' isn't standard. Maybe the correct term is Last Glacial Maximum. So the option B says Late Glacial Maximum, which might not be accurate. So maybe the correct answer is G.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain. Another angle: the exposure of Beringia as a landmass happened because of the low sea levels, which were caused by the glaciation. So the period is the Last Glacial Period, which is option G.

Alternatively, perhaps the second part of the question is the name of the glacial period, which is the Last Glacial Period, making option G correct.

I think I'm going to go with option B, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is G.

Wait, I think I need to make a decision. The landmass is Beringia. Now, the period when the sea levels were lower is the Last Glacial Maximum, but if the options don't have that, perhaps the period is called the Last Glacial Period, which includes the LGM.

Looking at the options, option G is Beringia; Last Glacial Period.

Yes, I think that's correct. So the answer is G.

The question asks about the landmass exposed east of Siberia during the Pleistocene, between 28,000 and 18,000 years ago, and the name of the period during which this occurred. During this time, lower sea levels due to glaciation exposed Beringia, a land bridge connecting present-day Siberia and Alaska. The period in question is associated with the last ice age.

Key considerations include:

1. **Landmass Identification**: The exposed landmass east of Siberia is Beringia, which is widely recognized in geological and paleoclimatic studies.

2. **Period Nomenclature**: The period between 28,000 and 18,000 years ago falls within the Last Glacial Period (LGP), the most recent glacial period of the Pleistocene epoch. Within this period, the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) occurred around 20,000 years ago, marking the peak of ice sheet extent and the lowest sea levels. However, the question refers to the broader period, not just the LGM.

3. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option B (Beringia; Late Glacial Maximum)**: While the LGM is a specific event within the LGP, the term "Late Glacial Maximum" is not standard, and the question seems to refer to the broader period.
   - **Option G (Beringia; Last Glacial Period)**: This correctly identifies the broader period during which Beringia was exposed, encompassing the LGM.

Given the above, the correct answer is **G: Beringia; Last Glacial Period**, as it accurately reflects the broader period during which the landmass was exposed.

Answer: G
