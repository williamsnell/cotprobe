Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit stuck, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The question is about hemoglobin, which contains 0.355 percent iron. When they hydrolyze 100 grams of hemoglobin, they get 1.48 grams of tryptophan. I'm supposed to find the minimum molecular weight of hemoglobin based on these results. The options are from A to J, but I'll focus on the calculations.

First, I remember that the minimum molecular weight is determined by considering the component with the highest mass percentage. So, I think I need to compare the iron content and the tryptophan content in hemoglobin to see which one gives a higher molecular weight when calculated.

Wait, no. Actually, the minimum molecular weight is found by taking the component that would require the largest possible molecular weight to be consistent with the data. So, I think I should calculate the molecular weight based on each element or component and then take the higher one. Because the actual molecular weight must be at least as large as each of these calculated values.

So, let's start with the iron. Hemoglobin is 0.355% iron. So, in 100 grams, that's 0.355 grams of iron. Iron's atomic weight is about 55.85 g/mol. So, the number of moles of iron would be 0.355 g divided by 55.85 g/mol. Let me calculate that.

0.355 / 55.85 ≈ 0.00636 moles. Since each hemoglobin molecule contains a certain number of iron atoms, I think each hemoglobin has four iron atoms, one in each heme group. Wait, but wait, I'm not sure. Does each hemoglobin have four? I think so because each subunit (there are four) has a heme with one iron. So, four irons per hemoglobin molecule.

So, if four iron atoms are present per molecule, then the number of moles of hemoglobin would be 0.00636 / 4 = 0.00159 moles. Then, the molecular weight would be moles multiplied by molar mass. Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that. The molecular weight (M) is calculated as mass per mole. So, if 0.355g Fe corresponds to X moles of hemoglobin, then M = 0.355g / (X) ?

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. The formula is: 

Mass of component = (moles of hemoglobin) × (moles of component per mole of hemoglobin) × (atomic weight of component).

So, for iron: 0.355 g = (n) × (4) × (55.85 g/mol), where n is the moles of hemoglobin. Solving for n: n = 0.355 / (4 × 55.85) ≈ 0.355 / 223.4 ≈ 0.001588 moles. Then, the molecular weight would be (100 g / n) = 100 / 0.001588 ≈ 63,000 g/mol. So about 63,000.

Wait, that calculation gives a molecular weight of 100 g divided by 0.001588 moles, which is approximately 63,000 g/mol. Hmm, but wait, 0.355 grams is per 100 grams of hemoglobin, so that's correct.

Now, moving on to tryptophan. When 100g of hemoglobin is hydrolyzed, it gives 1.48g of tryptophan. Tryptophan has a molecular formula of C11H12N2O2. Let me calculate its molecular weight. 

Carbon is 12 ×11 = 132, hydrogen is 12, nitrogen is 14×2=28, oxygen is 16×2=32. So 132+12=144 +28=172 +32=204 g/mol.

So, the moles of tryptophan in 100g hemoglobin are 1.48g / 204 g/mol ≈ 0.007255 moles.

Assuming that each hemoglobin molecule contains a certain number of tryptophan residues. Wait, but wait—the question doesn't specify how many tryptophan residues are in each hemoglobin. Hmm, I think the problem assumes that all the tryptophan in hemoglobin comes from the protein. But without knowing how many tryptophan residues per molecule, how can I calculate the molecular weight?

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that tryptophan is the only amino acid present, but that can't be right. No, hemoglobin is a protein made of many amino acids, including tryptophan. The question gives the amount of tryptophan in 100g of hemoglobin, so perhaps I can use that to find the minimum molecular weight.

Wait, perhaps in this calculation, tryptophan would give a lower bound for the molecular weight, and iron another, and the minimum of the two would be the answer. Or perhaps the higher one is the minimum, as the actual molecular weight must be at least as large as the higher of the two.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The minimum molecular weight is the smallest possible MW that is consistent with the data. So, if each hemoglobin has only one tryptophan, then the MW would be lower. But if there are more, the MW would be higher. Since the question asks for the minimum, I should assume the maximum number of tryptophan residues per molecule to get the smallest possible MW. Wait, no, that's the opposite. Let me clarify.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the number of tryptophan residues per molecule is as small as possible to maximize the number of hemoglobin molecules, thereby minimizing the molecular weight. Wait, that might not be the right approach. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate based on each component, and the molecular weight must be at least as large as the larger of the two.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of moles. For tryptophan, 1.48g is 0.007255 moles. If each hemoglobin molecule contains 'n' tryptophan residues, then the number of hemoglobin moles would be 0.007255 / n. The molecular weight would be (100g) / (0.007255 / n) ) = (100 × n) / 0.007255.

But without knowing 'n', how can I proceed? Maybe the problem expects me to use the assumption that each hemoglobin molecule contains only one tryptophan residue? No, that's not correct. I think I'm missing something here.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the molecular weight based on each component, and then take the higher value as the minimum MW. So, from iron, I got about 63,000 g/mol. From tryptophan, let's see: 1.48g is 0.007255 moles. But how many moles of hemoglobin is that?

Assuming that each hemoglobin molecule has, say, x tryptophan residues, then the number of hemoglobin moles would be 0.007255 / x. Then, the molecular weight would be 100g / (0.007255/x) = (100 × x) / 0.007255.

But without knowing x, I can't compute this. Hmm. Maybe the problem expects me to use the tryptophan data to find the minimum MW, assuming that each molecule contains a certain number of tryptophan residues. Alternatively, perhaps the question is only considering one of the components, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The question says that upon hydrolysis, 100g gives 1.48g tryptophan. So, tryptophan is 1.48% of hemoglobin. So, 1.48/100 = 0.0148, so 1.48% by mass is tryptophan.

So, the weight percent of tryptophan is 1.48%. So, using that, what's the molecular weight based on tryptophan?

The formula for minimum molecular weight when considering a component is:

MW = (percentage by mass × 10) / (number of such atoms per molecule × atomic weight) )

Wait, no, I think it's:

The minimum molecular weight is calculated by taking the mass percentage and dividing by the mole fraction, but perhaps I should think in terms of grams per mole.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to find how many moles of tryptophan are present in 100g, then determine how many hemoglobin molecules that would correspond to, and from that, find the molecular weight.

Wait, let's get back. The moles of tryptophan are 1.48g / 204 g/mol ≈ 0.007255 mol. 

Assuming that each hemoglobin molecule contains 'r' tryptophan residues, then the number of hemoglobin molecules is 0.007255 / r. 

The molecular weight (MW) of hemoglobin would be 100g / (0.007255 / r) ) = (100 * r) / 0.007255 ≈ (100r) / 0.007255.

To find the minimum MW, I want to maximize 'r', the number of tryptophan per hemoglobin. Because if 'r' is larger, the denominator gets bigger, making MW smaller. Wait, no, actually, if 'r' is larger, the number of hemoglobin molecules would be smaller, so 100g would correspond to fewer moles, thus a higher molecular weight. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this backwards.

Wait, no. The molecular weight is 100g divided by the number of moles. So, if 'r' is the number of tryptophan per hemoglobin, then the moles of hemoglobin would be 0.007255 / r. So, MW = 100 / (0.007255 / r) ) = (100 * r) / 0.007255. So, as 'r' increases, MW increases. Therefore, to find the minimum possible MW, I need to assume the smallest possible 'r', which is 1. Because if each hemoglobin has at least one tryptophan, then 'r' can't be less than 1. So, 'r' is 1.

Wait, that makes sense. So, if each hemoglobin has at least one tryptophan, then the minimum MW would be (100 * 1) / 0.007255 ≈ 13,790 g/mol.

So, about 13,800. Looking at the options, option C is 13,800 and F is 15,800.

Wait, earlier with iron, I calculated about 63,000. So, between 13,800 and 63,000, the higher value would be the minimum possible MW because the actual MW must be at least as high as both calculations. Therefore, the minimum MW would be 63,000, but looking at the options, option B is 66,500, which is close.

Wait, let me double-check the iron calculation. 0.355g Fe is 0.355 / 55.85 ≈ 0.00636 mol Fe. Since each hemoglobin has four Fe atoms, the moles of hemoglobin would be 0.00636 / 4 = 0.00159 mol. So, MW = 100g / 0.00159 mol ≈ 62,891 g/mol, which is approximately 62,900. So, the options don't have exactly that, but option B is 66,500, which is higher. Hmm, perhaps I made an error in the calculation.

Wait, wait. Let me recalculate the iron part precisely. 0.355 grams divided by 55.85 g/mol.

55.85 is approximately 55.85, so 0.355 / 55.85. Let me compute this accurately.

0.355 ÷ 55.85: Let's see, 55.85 × 0.006 is 0.3351. 0.355 - 0.3351 = 0.0199. So, 0.006 + (0.0199 / 55.85) ≈ 0.006 + 0.000356 = approximately 0.006356 moles of Fe.

Each hemoglobin has four Fe atoms, so moles of hemoglobin = 0.006356 / 4 ≈ 0.001589 moles.

So, MW = 100g / 0.001589 mol ≈ 62,890 g/mol, which is about 62,890. So, approx 62,900.

Looking at the options, the closest is option B: 66,500. But wait, perhaps I should calculate it more precisely.

Wait, 0.355 divided by 55.85: Let me do this with more precision.

55.85 × 0.006 = 0.3351. The difference is 0.355 - 0.3351 = 0.0199. So, 0.0199 / 55.85 ≈ 0.000356. So, total is 0.006356 moles Fe.

Divide by 4: 0.006356 /4 = 0.001589 moles hemoglobin.

So, MW = 100g / 0.001589 mol ≈ 62,890 g/mol.

Hmm, but none of the options exactly match this. Option B is 66,500, which is higher. So, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe the problem doesn't assume four Fe atoms per hemoglobin. Maybe it's a different number. Wait, I think each hemoglobin has four subunits, each with one Fe, so four Fe atoms in total. So that part seems correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation from tryptophan gives a higher value, but let me check that again.

From tryptophan, assuming each hemoglobin has at least one tryptophan residue, the calculation was 100g * 1 / 0.007255 ≈ 13,790. So, that's way lower than 62,890.

So, the minimum MW must be at least 62,890, so the correct answer would be the option closest to that. Looking at the options, option B is 66,500, which is higher than 62,890. But perhaps I should check if the tryptophan approach gives a higher value.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something in the tryptophan calculation. Let me think again. The molar mass of tryptophan is 204 g/mol, as I calculated earlier. So, 1.48g is 1.48/204 = 0.007255 mol.

If each hemoglobin molecule has 'n' tryptophan residues, then moles of hemoglobin = 0.007255 / n.

So, the molecular weight would be 100g / (0.007255 /n ) ) = (100 * n ) / 0.007255.

So, the molecular weight depends on 'n'. To get the minimum possible MW, 'n' should be as large as possible because that would give a smaller molecular weight. Wait, no. Because as 'n' increases, (100*n) increases, so MW increases. Wait, no, that's not correct. Because if 'n' is the number of tryptophan per hemoglobin, and you have more 'n', then each hemoglobin contributes more tryptophan, so fewer hemoglobins are needed to account for the 0.007255 moles of tryptophan.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it this way: The minimum possible molecular weight would be when 'n' is as small as possible. Because a smaller 'n' would require more hemoglobin molecules to make up the 0.007255 moles of tryptophan, thus a smaller molecular weight.

Wait, but if 'n' is 1, then the number of hemoglobin molecules is 0.007255 / 1 = 0.007255 mol. So, the molecular weight would be 100g / 0.007255 mol ≈ 13,790 g/mol.

If 'n' is 2, then hemoglobin moles would be 0.007255/2 ≈ 0.0036275 mol. So, MW = 100 / 0.0036275 ≈ 27,570 g/mol.

If 'n' is 3, then MW would be 41,300. And so on. So, the higher 'n' is, the higher the MW from tryptophan.

Wait, but the problem is to find the minimum possible MW, so I should take the smallest possible 'n', which is 1, leading to MW ≈13,800. But earlier, from iron, I got 62,890. So, the minimum MW must be the higher of the two, because the actual MW must satisfy both conditions. So, the minimum possible MW is 62,890, which isn't exactly an option. The closest is option B:66,500.

But wait, perhaps I'm supposed to take the higher value between the two. Because the actual MW must be at least as large as each of the calculated values. So, if from iron I get ~63,000 and from tryptophan I get ~13,800, the minimum possible MW is 63,000. Since option B is 66,500, which is higher than 63,000, so the correct answer would be B.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the initial approach. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: The minimum molecular weight is determined by the component that gives the highest required MW. So, between Fe and tryptophan.

Fe gives 62,890, tryptophan gives 13,800 when assuming one per molecule. So, the higher is 62,890. So, the minimum possible MW is 62,890, and the closest option is B:66,500. But perhaps I should recheck the exact calculation.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the number of Fe atoms per hemoglobin. Maybe it's more than four? No, I think four is correct, as each of the four subunits has one heme with one Fe.

Wait, let's recalculate using precise numbers.

Fe content: 0.355 g in 100g.

Molar mass of Fe: 55.845 g/mol.

Moles of Fe = 0.355 / 55.845 = let's compute this accurately.

55.845 × 0.006 = 0.33507 → 0.355 - 0.33507 = 0.01993.

0.01993 / 55.845 ≈ 0.0003567.

So, 0.006 + 0.0003567 ≈ 0.0063567 moles Fe.

Each hemoglobin has 4 Fe atoms, so moles of hemoglobin = 0.0063567 / 4 ≈ 0.001
