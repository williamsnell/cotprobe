Okay, I'm trying to figure out this question about the just-noticeable difference (JND) and what it depends on. So the question is asking what the detection of a JND depends on. I remember from my psychology class that JND is related to Weber's Law.

Wait, Weber's Law... right, it states that the just-noticeable difference in a stimulus is proportional to the original stimulus intensity. So if you have a certain weight, say 100 grams, the JND would be a percentage of that, like 10 grams, so you can notice the difference when it's 110 grams. So the JND depends on the intensity of the original stimulus.

Looking at the options, let me go through each one.

Option A: Presence of a "no stimulus" control and the sensitivity of the equipment. Hmm, no, JND is more about the relative change, not about whether there's a no-stimulus control. Also, the equipment's sensitivity would affect measurements, but I don't think it's what JND depends on inherently.

Option B: Initial determination of absolute threshold and variation of the difference threshold. Absolute threshold is the minimum detectable stimulus, whereas JND is about the difference. They're related but not the same. So I don't think this is correct.

Option C: Frequency of the existing stimulus and presence of other sensory modalities. Frequency might affect things, but JND is more about the intensity relative to the original, not the frequency. Also, other sensory modalities don't directly influence the JND of a specific stimulus.

Option D: Intensity of the new stimulus and that of the stimulus already present. Oh, this sounds right. Because JND is about the difference relative to the original. So the new stimulus has to be a certain percentage higher than the existing one for it to be noticeable. So it depends on the intensity of both.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because the JND is calculated as the difference between two stimuli where the difference is just noticeable. So the formula is ΔI/I = constant. So the JND (ΔI) is proportional to I, the original intensity. So the JND depends on the original stimulus's intensity. So in the question, it's about detecting the JND, which would involve comparing the new stimulus to the existing one.

So option D says it depends on the intensity of the new and the existing. That makes sense because you have to compare them to determine if the difference is noticeable.

Alternatively, option B mentions the difference threshold, which I think is another term for JND. But the option talks about the variation of the difference threshold, which I'm not sure. No, I think the correct answer is D because it's directly about comparing the two intensities.

The just-noticeable difference (JND) is a concept rooted in Weber's Law, which states that the smallest detectable difference in a stimulus is proportional to the intensity of the original stimulus. This means that to determine whether a difference is noticeable, one must compare the intensity of the new stimulus to that of the existing stimulus. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** refers to the presence of a "no stimulus" control and equipment sensitivity, which are not directly related to the inherent calculation or detection of JND.
- **Option B** mentions absolute threshold and variation of the difference threshold. While absolute threshold is the minimum detectable stimulus, JND specifically pertains to the detectable difference between two stimuli, making this option less relevant.
- **Option C** focuses on stimulus frequency and other sensory modalities, which do not directly influence the detection of JND.
- **Option D** correctly identifies that JND depends on the intensity of the new stimulus and the intensity of the existing stimulus, aligning with Weber's Law.

Thus, the detection of JND depends on comparing the intensities of the new and existing stimuli, making **Option D** the correct choice.
