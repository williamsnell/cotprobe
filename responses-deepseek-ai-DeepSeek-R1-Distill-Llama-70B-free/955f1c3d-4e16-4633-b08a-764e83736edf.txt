Okay, so I have this question about the brain at birth, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is asking which part of the brain is the least developed at birth. The options are A through J, each a different brain structure.

Hmm, I remember that the brain develops a lot after birth, especially in the first few years. I think the cerebral cortex, which is part of the cortex option, is something that's not fully developed at birth. Wait, but isn't the cortex the outer layer responsible for higher functions like thinking and sensory processing? Oh right, I think that the cortex is actually the part that's not fully developed at birth, which is why newborns can't do complex things.

Wait, other options: the thalamus is involved in relaying sensory information. I don't think that's the least developed. The brain stem controls basic functions like breathing, so that's probably well-developed because babies need to breathe right away.

The frontal lobe is part of the cortex, right? I remember the frontal lobe is involved in planning and decision-making, which are things that develop as the child grows. So maybe the frontal lobe is underdeveloped at birth, but the question is about the least developed part overall.

The cerebellum is for coordination and balance. I think it's also not fully developed, which is why infants have poor motor skills. But is it the least developed compared to others?

Looking at the options, the question is about the least developed part. I think the cortex, especially parts like the frontal lobe, are really immature. But the question is about the least, so maybe the answer is the frontal lobe (option C). Or is it the visual system (A)? Wait, newborns can see, but their vision isn't very clear. So the visual system might be underdeveloped, but I'm not sure if it's the least.

Alternatively, the brain stem (D) is pretty developed because it controls vital functions. The parietal lobe (E) handles sensory info, like touch, which a baby can feel.

Wait, the question is about the least developed. I think the higher-order areas like the frontal lobe develop later. So the least developed part at birth would be areas responsible for higher functions, which are the frontal lobes or the cortex.

Looking at the options, option C is frontal lobe, G is cortex. So which one is the correct answer?

I remember reading that at birth, the cerebral cortex is not fully developed, which allows for plasticity. So the cortex is the least developed. So option G.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "the least developed part of the brain is the..." So the options are parts of the brain. The cortex is the outer layer, and it's part of the cerebrum. So, the question is about which structure is least developed.

Alternatively, maybe the question refers to the fact that the frontal lobe is the least developed, as it's responsible for executive functions that mature much later.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. At birth, the brain is about 25% of its adult size. Most of the neurons are present, but the connections (synapses) are not fully formed. The parts that develop later are the higher-order thinking areas.

The frontal lobe is part of the cortex, and it's responsible for complex functions. So perhaps the frontal lobe is the least developed. Alternatively, the cortex as a whole is not fully developed.

Looking at the options, both C (frontal lobe) and G (cortex) are possibilities. Which one is considered the least developed?

I think the question is pointing towards the cortex in general, which is option G. Because the cortex is responsible for a lot of higher functions that develop postnatally. So the least developed at birth would be the cortex.

Wait, but another thought: the cerebellum is also not fully developed. But the cerebellum starts to develop earlier, I think. So maybe the cortex is the least developed.

So the correct answer would be G: cortex.

The question asks which part of the brain is the least developed at birth. To determine this, it's important to consider the developmental stages of different brain regions. 

- **Visual system (A):** While newborns have limited vision, the visual system is not the least developed compared to other brain regions. 
- **Thalamus (B):** The thalamus, which relays sensory information, is relatively developed at birth to handle basic sensory processing.
- **Frontal lobe (C):** The frontal lobe, responsible for higher-order functions like decision-making and planning, is indeed underdeveloped at birth. However, it is part of a larger structure, the cortex.
- **Brain stem (D):** The brain stem, controlling vital functions like breathing, is well-developed at birth to ensure survival.
- **Parietal lobe (E):** The parietal lobe, involved in sensory processing, is also functional at birth.
- **Cerebellum (F):** The cerebellum, responsible for motor coordination, is not fully developed, but it begins developing earlier than the cortex.
- **Cortex (G):** The cortex, the outer layer of the brain responsible for higher functions like thinking and sensory processing, is the least developed at birth. This allows for significant plasticity and development in the first few years of life.
- **Basal ganglia (H):** The basal ganglia, involved in movement control, are relatively developed compared to the cortex.
- **Hypothalamus (I):** The hypothalamus, regulating bodily functions, is functional at birth.
- **Limbic system (J):** The limbic system, involved in emotions and memory, develops after birth but is not the least developed.

Given this analysis, the cortex (G) is the least developed part of the brain at birth, as it is responsible for higher-order functions that mature postnatally.
