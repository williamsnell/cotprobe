Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the full-load torque of a motor and then finding some percentages. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on motor calculations, but I'll try to work through it.

Alright, the problem gives me two motors. One is a 1/50-hp motor running at 1500 rpm, and the other is a 1/20-hp motor at 1550 rpm with max torque 38 oz-in and starting torque 12 oz-in. I need to find the full-load torque for the first motor and then see what percentage the given torques are of that full-load.

Wait, wait. So the first part is to find the full-load torque of the 1/50 hp motor. I remember that torque is related to horsepower and speed. The formula I think is torque (in pound-feet) equals horsepower multiplied by 5252 divided by the speed in rpm. Or wait, is it 746? No, wait, 1 horsepower is 746 watts, but in torque calculations, I think the 5252 number comes from converting units.

Wait, right, the formula is Torque (lb-ft) = (HP * 5252) / RPM. Because 1 horsepower is 550 foot-pounds per second, so when you multiply by 5252 (which is 550 ft-lbs/sec * 60 sec/min / (2π rad) ) to get torque in lb-ft.

So for the 1/50 hp motor at 1500 rpm:

Torque = (1/50 hp * 5252) / 1500 rpm.

Let me calculate that. 5252 divided by 50 is 105.04, divided by 1500 gives approximately 0.07003 lb-ft. So roughly 0.07 lb-ft.

Then, converting that to ounce-inches. Since 1 lb-ft is 16*12 = 192 oz-in. So 0.07 lb-ft * 192 oz-in per lb-ft = 13.44 oz-in, approximately 13.4 oz-in.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see 0.07 lb-ft and 13.4 oz-in in option A. Or 12 oz-in in option J, but I think J's torque is 12 oz-in, which is for the starting. Hmm, no, wait, the 1/50 hp motor's full load torque is 0.07 lb-ft or 13.4 oz-in.

Now, the next part is about the other motor, the 1/20 hp at 1550 rpm, which has max torque 38 oz-in and starting torque 12 oz-in. I need to find what percentage these are with respect to the full-load torque of the first motor.

Wait, wait. Oh, wait, no. Wait, the question says: what percentages are these torques (38 and 12 oz-in) with respect to the full-load torque. So I think the full-load torque is that of the 1/20 hp motor, not the 1/50 hp. Or wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the first motor is the 1/50 hp, and the question is about the 1/20 hp motor's torques relative to the first's full-load torque. Or wait, no, no, the question is a bit unclear. Let me read again.

The problem states: "A 1/20-hp 1,550-rpm shaded-pole motor has a maximum torque of 38 oz-in. and a starting torque of 12 oz-in. What percentages are these torques with respect to the full-load torque?"

Wait, so the full-load torque is of which motor? Oh, the first one. Because earlier it's about calculating the full-load torque for the 1/50 hp motor. So the 38 and 12 oz-in are from the 1/20 hp, but we're comparing them to the full-load torque of the 1/50 hp motor's.

Wait, that seems a bit strange because usually you compare torques to their own full load, but maybe the problem is structured that way. Let me confirm. So the first motor is 1/50 hp, 1500 rpm. The second is 1/20 hp, 1550 rpm, and has max torque 38 oz-in and starting torque 12 oz-in. The question is, for these two torques, what percentage are they of the full-load torque. So which full-load torque? The first motor's full-load.

Wait, that doesn't make much sense because the full-load torque of the 1/50 hp motor is 0.07 lb-ft or 13.4 oz-in. So taking the 38 oz-in and 12 oz-in and expressing them as percentages of 13.4 oz-in.

Wait, but 38 is way bigger than 13.4. 38/13.4 is about 2.83, so 283%. But the options don't have anything that high. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding which motor's full-load torque we're using.

Wait, perhaps I got the question wrong. Let me read again. Oh, wait, the problem says "calculate the full-load torque of a 1/50 hp 1500 rpm motor." So that's the first part. Then, for the 1/20 hp motor, which has max torque 38 oz-in and starting torque 12 oz-in, what percentage are these torques with respect to the full-load torque of the 1/50 hp motor?

Wait, that would make sense. So the full-load torque is 13.4 oz-in (from 0.07 lb-ft). So 38 oz-in is 38/13.4 = approx 2.836, 283%. But that's not in the options. So perhaps I'm missing something. Oh wait, perhaps the full-load torque of the 1/20 hp motor is different, but that's not what the question is asking. The question is about the full-load torque of the 1/50 hp motor.

Wait, but looking at the options, the percentages are all around 110-125%, which are much lower than 283%. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the full-load torque for the 1/20 hp motor, but that's not the first part. The first part is the 1/50 hp.

Wait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me read again.

The first sentence: "Calculate the full-load torque, in pound-feet and ounce-inches, of a 1/50-hp 1,500-rpm shaded-pole motor." So that's the first part.

The second part: "A 1/20-hp 1,550-rpm shaded-pole motor has a maximum torque of 38 oz-in. and a starting torque of 12 oz-in. What percentages are these torques with respect to the full-load torque?"

Ah, wait, perhaps the full-load torque is for the 1/20 hp motor. No, the question says, "these torques with respect to the full-load torque." The full-load torque being the one we just calculated for the 1/50 hp motor.

Wait, but that can't be, because 38 oz-in is way bigger than the 13.4 oz-in full-load torque of the 1/50 hp. So 38 / 13.4 is 283%, which is way higher than any option given. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is that the 1/20 hp motor's full-load torque is being considered. But no, the first part is about the 1/50 hp.

Wait, maybe I got the formula wrong. Let me think again. The torque formula is Torque (in lb-ft) = (HP * 5252) / (RPM * 100). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Or perhaps the formula is in oz-in, so maybe I need to adjust units.

Wait, another approach: torque in oz-in can be found by (HP * 8,850) / RPM. Because 1 hp = 550 lb-ft per second. So for torque in oz-in, which is 1/16 ft and 1/12 lb.

Wait, maybe the formula is: T (oz-in) = (HP * 8,850) / RPM. Let me check the units.

Wait, 1 HP = 550 lb-ft/sec. Torque is in lb-ft, so T = HP * 5252 / (speed in rpm). Because 5252 is 550 * 60 / (2π). So that's correct for lb-ft.

Alternatively, for ounce-inches:

1 lb-ft = 12 inches *16 oz = 192 oz-in. So if T in lb-ft is (HP * 5252)/RPM, then in oz-in it's (HP * 5252 * 192) / RPM.

Wait, no, that can't be right because 1 lb-ft is 192 oz-in. So if you have torque in lb-ft, multiply by 192 to get oz-in.

So for the 1/50 hp motor:

Torque (lb-ft) = (1/50 * 5252) / 1500. Let's compute that.

1/50 is 0.02. 0.02 * 5252 = 105.04. Divide by 1500: 105.04 /1500 ≈ 0.0700 lb-ft.

Convert to oz-in: 0.07 lb-ft * 192 oz-in/lb-ft = 13.44 oz-in, approximately 13.4 oz-in.

So that's the first part: 0.07 lb-ft and 13.4 oz-in.

Now, the second part: the 1/20 hp motor's maximum torque is 38 oz-in, and starting torque is 12 oz-in. What percentage are these of the full-load torque of the 1/50 hp motor (13.4 oz-in).

So 38 /13.4 = approx 2.836, which is 283.6%. But none of the options have this. So that can't be right. Therefore, perhaps I misunderstood which motor's full-load torque we're using.

Wait, perhaps the full-load torque is for the same motor as the one being tested. So for the 1/20 hp motor, we calculate its full-load torque, and then find what percent 38 and 12 are of that.

But the question's wording is that the first calculation is for the 1/50 hp motor's full-load torque. Then, the percentages are for the 1/20 hp's torques relative to that 1/50 hp's torque.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the percentages are with respect to the 1/20 hp motor's own full-load torque. But the question doesn't mention calculating that, only the 1/50 hp's.

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is: Calculate the full-load torque of a 1/50-hp 1500 rpm motor. Then, for a 1/20-hp 1550 rpm motor which has max torque 38 oz-in and starting torque 12 oz-in, what percentages are these torques with respect to the full-load torque?

Ah, the full-load torque in question is the one we calculated for the 1/50 hp motor. So the 38 and 12 oz-in are compared to 13.4 oz-in.

But as I calculated, 38/13.4 = 283.6%, and 12/13.4 = 89.55%. But the answer options don't have anything like that. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe the question is the other way: the 1/50 hp motor's full-load torque is being compared to the 1/20 hp's torques. But that doesn't make sense since the 1/50 hp motor is smaller.

Alternatively, perhaps the full-load torque is for the 1/20 hp motor, and the percentages are of that. So let me compute the full-load torque for the 1/20 hp motor at 1550 rpm.

Torque (lb-ft) = (1/20 hp * 5252) / 1550 rpm.

1/20 is 0.05. 0.05 *5252 = 262.6. Divide by 1550: 262.6 / 1550 ≈ 0.1695 lb-ft.

Convert to oz-in: 0.1695 * 192 ≈ 32.5 oz-in.

So the full-load torque of the 1/20 hp motor is about 32.5 oz-in.

Now, the max torque is 38 oz-in, which is 38/32.5 = approx 1.169, so 116.9%. The starting torque is 12/32.5 ≈ 0.369, so 36.9%.

Looking at the options, let's see.

Option C: 0.08 lb-ft, 14 oz-in, 115%, 35%. No, the torques here are 38 and 12 compared to 32.5, which gives 116.9% and 36.9%. So looking for 116% and 37%.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 118%, 37% → no, 116.9 is closer to 117%.

Option H: 116%, 36%. That's close.

Option B: 119%, 39%. Hmm, 116.9 is 117, which isn't exact.

Option J: 119%, 38%. No.

Wait, let me recheck my calculation for the 1/20 hp's full-load torque.

Wait, wait. The first part is for the 1/50 hp motor, which gives 0.07 lb-ft and 13.4 oz-in.

The second part is for the 1/20 hp motor, but the question is about percentages relative to the 1/50 hp motor's full-load torque.

But according to this, 38/13.4 is 283%, which isn't any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the full-load torque for both motors and see.

Wait, perhaps the question is that for the 1/20 hp motor, the full-load torque is 32.5 oz-in, and the max torque is 38 oz-in, which is 116.9% of its own full load. But the question is asking with respect to the 1/50 hp's full load, which is 13.4 oz-in.

Wait, that can't be, because 38/13.4 is 283%, which isn't in the options.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the full-load torque for the 1/50 hp.

Wait, let me recalculate. 1/50 hp at 1500 rpm.

Torque (lb-ft) = (1/50 * 5252) / 1500.

1/50 is 0.02. 0.02 *5252 = 105.04.

105.04 /1500 = 0.0700266... lb-ft. So 0.07 lb-ft.

Convert to oz-in: 0.07 * 192 = 13.44 oz-in.

Yes, that's correct.

So for the 1/20 hp motor's torques (38 and 12 oz-in) relative to 13.44 oz-in:

38 /13.44 = approx 2.826 → 282.6%.

12 /13.44 = 0.892 → 89.2%.

But none of the options have percentages that high. So perhaps the question is not comparing to the 1/50 hp's torque but to the 1/20 hp's own full-load torque.

Wait, but that's conflicting with the question's wording. The question says, "with respect to the full-load torque" without specifying which motor. But the first part was about the 1/50 hp. So perhaps the intended meaning is that the 1/20 hp motor's max and starting torques are being compared to the 1/50 hp's full-load torque.

But then the percentages don't match any of the options. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the question is that both motors are shaded-pole, and perhaps their full-load torques are being compared based on horsepower and speed. Maybe I need to find the full-load torque of the 1/50 hp, then for the 1/20 hp, find the full-load torque, and then what percentage their given max and starting torques are of that.

Wait, no, the question is structured as: first calculate the 1/50 hp's full-load torque, then for the 1/20 hp, given its max and starting torques, what percentage are those of the 1/50 hp's full-load torque.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the question expects the percentages to be relative to the 1/20 hp's own full-load torque, even though the question says "the full-load torque" without specifying which motor. But that would make sense, because otherwise the percentages are way too high.

Wait, perhaps the question is that the full-load torque is the one we calculated for the 1/50 hp, and then the 1/20 hp's torques are being compared to that. But then the options don't have 283%, which is confusing.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is 0.07 lb-ft, 13.4 oz-in, 118%, 37%. Hmm, 38/13.4 is 283%, which isn't 118. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps I should find the full-load torque for both motors and then see the percentages.

Wait, the 1/50 hp motor's full-load torque is 13.4 oz-in. The 1/20 hp motor's full-load torque is what I calculated earlier as 32.5 oz-in.

Wait, but the question says that the 1/20 hp motor has a maximum torque of 38 oz-in and starting torque of 12 oz-in. So perhaps the percentages are of the 1/20 hp's full-load torque, not the 1/50 hp's.

But the question says, "these torques with respect to the full-load torque," referring to the torque we calculated earlier, which is the 1/50 hp's.

I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the full-load torque is the same for both motors because they're similar, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. Let's look at the options. The first two numbers are the full-load torque for the 1/50 hp motor in lb-ft and oz-in. So the options A through J have 0.04 to 0.10 lb-ft and 8-16 oz-in.

Our calculation is 0.07 lb-ft (approx 0.07) and 13.4 oz-in. Looking at the options, option A is 0.07 lb-ft, 13.4 oz-in. Option E is 0.09 lb-ft, 15 oz-in. So option A matches our
