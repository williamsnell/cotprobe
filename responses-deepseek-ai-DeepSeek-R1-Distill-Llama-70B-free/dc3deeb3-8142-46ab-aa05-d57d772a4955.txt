Question:

An employer and employee had an employment contract that contained an "at will" provision allowing either party to terminate the employment upon reasonable notice. One year later, the employer had the employee sign a covenant not to compete for a two-year period after termination. Two years later, the employee quit and went to work for a competitor company. The prior employer sued, asking for a preliminary injunction to enforce the covenant. The employee argued that the covenant was invalid because no consideration passed to her  she could be fired at any time and did not receive anything for signing. The employer argued that it provided her with continued employment when it did not have to do so. Does the employer have a legal right to enforce the covenant?

Options:

A: No, because there was inadequate consideration for the covenant.
B: No, because the employee didn't receive additional compensation for the covenant.
C: Yes, because the employer's providing of continued employment for a substantial period after signing the covenant is adequate consideration.
D: Yes, because the covenant was signed voluntarily by the employee.
E: No, because the "at will" provision in the initial contract negates the enforceability of the covenant.
F: Yes, because the employer has a right to protect its business interests.
G: Yes, because the courts never question the adequacy of consideration in an agreement.
H: Yes, because modification of an existing contract does not require consideration.
I: Yes, because the covenant was part of the original employment contract.
J: No, because the covenant is unreasonable and therefore unenforceable.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the employer can enforce the covenant not to compete against the employee. Let me break this down.

First, the initial employment contract was "at will," meaning either party could terminate with reasonable notice. Then, a year later, the employer had the employee sign a non-compete agreement for two years after termination. The employee claims there was no consideration, so the covenant isn't valid. The employer says continued employment was the consideration because they didn't have to keep her.

I remember that for a contract to be enforceable, there needs to be consideration. Consideration is something of value exchanged between the parties. In employment contracts, when an employer asks an employee to sign a non-compete after they've already started working, the issue is whether there's sufficient consideration.

In some states, continued employment is enough. But wait, I think in some places, if the employee is "at will," meaning they can be fired at any time, then continued employment might not count as consideration because the employer isn't making a promise they weren't already legally bound to. Like, if they can fire the employee whenever, then not firing them isn't a new promise.

So, in this case, the employer's argument is that by allowing her to continue working, that's the consideration. But since the employment was at will, the employer wasn't required to keep her. So, is the continued employment enough? I'm a bit fuzzy on this.

I think some courts say that if the employee continues to work for a substantial period after signing the covenant, that can count as consideration. But others might say that without a promise of continued employment, it's not enough. Also, some jurisdictions require new consideration beyond just keeping the job if it's at will.

So, in this scenario, the employee worked for two years after signing the covenant. That's a substantial period. So maybe the employer's argument holds because she worked for two years, which could be seen as the consideration.

Looking at the options, option C says yes because the employer provided continued employment for a substantial period. That seems to align with the idea that the time she worked after signing counts as consideration.

But option E says no because the at-will provision negates the covenant's enforceability. Hmm. I think the at-will nature affects whether the continued employment is consideration. If the employer could fire her any time, then the promise to continue employment isn't a new benefit, so no consideration. But if she actually stayed employed for a while, maybe that counts as consideration.

I'm a bit confused because different states have different rules. For example, in some places, continued at-will employment isn't enough, but in others, it is if the employee continues working for a while.

So, in this problem, since she worked two years after signing, which is a substantial time, maybe that counts as consideration. So the employer can enforce the covenant.

Looking at the options again, option C says yes because of the substantial period. So the answer would be C.

The enforceability of the covenant not to compete hinges on whether there was sufficient consideration when the employee signed it. Consideration requires a bargained-for exchange, and in this case, the employer argues that continued employment served as consideration. However, since the employment was "at will," the employer had no legal obligation to continue the employment, which could weaken the argument that continued employment alone constitutes consideration.

Nevertheless, some jurisdictions recognize that if the employee continues working for a substantial period after signing the covenant, this can constitute valid consideration. Here, the employee worked for two years after signing the agreement, which could be deemed a substantial period. Therefore, the employer's argument that continued employment for a substantial period constitutes adequate consideration is likely to prevail.

Answer: C
