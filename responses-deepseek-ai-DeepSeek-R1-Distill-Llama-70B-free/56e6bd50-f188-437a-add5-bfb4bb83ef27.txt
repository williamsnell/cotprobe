Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the three basic goals of psychology. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think carefully.

The question asks to discuss the three basic goals. I remember from my notes that psychology has some core objectives. Let me try to recall. I think they are something like describe, explain, and predict behavior, and maybe control or influence it. Or wait, was it describe, understand, and predict? Hmm.

Looking at the options:

Option C says the goals are to measure and describe behavior, predict and control behavior, and understand and explain behavior. That sounds familiar. I think that's the standard set. So measure/describe is like observing and recording behavior. Predict is about using that data to forecast what will happen. Control would be applying that knowledge to influence behavior.

Option G talks about studying the mind, understanding emotions, and promoting mental health. That seems more like applications or specific areas within psychology rather than the basic scientific goals. It's more about what psychologists might do in practice rather than the foundational goals.

Option I mentions understanding human development, studying social interactions, and promoting positive behavior. Again, these are specific areas or applications. For example, developmental psychology or social psychology focus on those, but not the overarching goals.

Option H is about diagnosing disorders, improving relationships, and promoting self-understanding. That's more clinical and applied, not the basic research goals.

Option A is about education, preventing crises, and animal behavior. That seems off-topic for the basic goals. Animal behavior is more ethology or a specific branch.

Option B is about spiritual experiences and creativity, which doesn't fit the core goals. Option D talks about cognitive performance and technology, which is more applied. Option E is about economics and art, which is unrelated. Option F is AI and genome mapping, definitely not. Option J is about medication and societal issues, which again is specific and not the foundational goals.

So, putting it together, the correct answer should be about describing, predicting, and explaining behavior. That matches option C.

The three basic goals of psychology are best captured by option C, which outlines the objectives of measuring and describing behavior, predicting and controlling behavior, and understanding and explaining behavior. These goals form the foundation of psychological study, focusing on observation, prediction, and application of knowledge. Other options either focus on specific applications or unrelated fields.
