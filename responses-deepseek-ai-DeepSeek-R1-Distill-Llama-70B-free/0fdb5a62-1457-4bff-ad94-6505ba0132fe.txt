Question:

Do third States enjoy any fishing rights within the Exclusive Economic Zone of another State?

Options:

A: Third States may never have access to fisheries within another State's EEZ
B: Third States are free to fish within another EEZ, except from certain designated areas
C: When the coastal State cannot harvest the 'total allowable catch', the coastal State is to give other State access to that surplus with priority to be given to developing and land-locked States
D: The coastal State must share all of its fish resources with all other States
E: Third States have access to fisheries within its EEZ only during a specific season
F: The coastal State is to give access to fisheries within its EEZ only to States with which it has diplomatic relations
G: Third States have unlimited fishing rights within the EEZ of any State
H: Third States can only fish within another State's EEZ with a special permit
I: The coastal State is to give access to fisheries within its EEZ only to neighbouring States
J: Third States can only fish within another State's EEZ if they have a mutual agreement

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about third states' fishing rights in another state's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). I remember from my studies that the EEZ is a zone where the coastal state has specific rights, especially regarding natural resources. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact rules about other countries' access.

The question is asking if third states can fish in another's EEZ. The options are A through J, each presenting different scenarios.

I think the key here is UNCLOS, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. I remember that within the EEZ, the coastal state has sovereign rights over the living and non-living resources. That means they can manage the fishing resources as they see fit. But does that mean other states can never fish there?

Wait, I think the coastal state is allowed to give access to other states if they can't catch the total allowable catch (TAC) themselves. So, if the coastal state's fishing capacity isn't enough to take all the available fish, they might let others take the surplus. But I also recall that there's a priority given to certain states, like developing countries or landlocked ones, maybe?

Looking at the options:

Option C says that when the coastal state can't harvest the TAC, they give access to the surplus, with priority to developing and land-locked states. That sounds familiar. I think that's correct because UNCLOS does mention giving preference to these states.

Option J says third states can only fish if they have a mutual agreement. That also sounds right because access is typically through agreements, but is it the only way? I think in some cases, like when the surplus is available, the coastal state might allow access without necessarily requiring a mutual agreement, but maybe they do. Or perhaps it's more about the coastal state's discretion.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. I think the general rule is that the coastal state has the right to manage the EEZ, and other states can only fish there with permission. So, without permission, they can't. So, in that sense, option H says third states can only fish with a special permit. That seems correct, but I'm not sure if it's the same as option C.

Option C is about when the coastal state can't harvest the TAC, they give access. So, it's a specific condition. Option H is more general, stating that access is only with a permit. So, both could be correct, but the question is asking if third states enjoy any rights. So, the right would exist under certain conditions, like when the coastal state allows it, perhaps through agreements or permits.

Wait, the question is about whether third states have any fishing rights. So, do they have any inherent right, or is it only by permission? I think it's the latter. So, they don't have automatic rights; they can only fish if the coastal state allows, which would usually be through some kind of agreement or permit.

Looking back, option J says access is only with a mutual agreement. Option C is about giving access when there's a surplus, with priority to certain states. So, both seem to describe situations where access is allowed, but under different conditions.

Wait, the question is whether third states enjoy any rights. So, the answer would be that under certain conditions, they do have rights, specifically when the coastal state can't harvest all the TAC and gives access to the surplus, especially to developing and land-locked states.

So, the correct answer would be option C. Because UNCLOS does state that the coastal state should give access to the surplus, and it gives priority to certain states.

Alternatively, option J says access is only with mutual agreement, which is also correct because access is typically through agreements. But the question is about whether any rights exist, and option C specifically addresses a scenario where rights are granted.

I think the better answer is option C because it directly addresses the scenario where third states have a right to access the surplus, which is a specific right under UNCLOS. Option J is more about the method of access (through agreement), but the existence of the right is covered in option C.

The question revolves around the fishing rights of third states within another state's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The EEZ grants the coastal state sovereign rights over living and non-living resources, including fish, under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). While the coastal state has primary authority to manage these resources, UNCLOS provides specific conditions under which third states may access the EEZ for fishing.

Option C correctly identifies that when the coastal state cannot harvest the total allowable catch (TAC), it is obligated to give other states access to the surplus. Furthermore, priority is given to developing and land-locked states in such cases. This aligns with UNCLOS provisions that emphasize equitable access to surplus resources.

Option J suggests that access is only possible through mutual agreements, which is partially correct, as agreements are a common method for granting fishing rights. However, the question specifically asks whether third states enjoy any fishing rights, and the existence of such rights is best captured by Option C, which highlights the scenario where access is granted due to surplus resources.

Thus, the correct answer is:

C: When the coastal State cannot harvest the 'total allowable catch', the coastal State is to give other State access to that surplus with priority to be given to developing and land-locked States.
