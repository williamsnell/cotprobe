Okay, so I have this Laplace transform problem to solve. The question is asking me to find the inverse Laplace transform of log[(s + 1)/(s - 1)] for s > 1. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that the Laplace transform is a powerful tool for solving differential equations, but here I need the inverse. The function given is the natural logarithm of a ratio. So, f(s) = ln[(s+1)/(s-1)]. Wait, that can probably be simplified. Oh right, ln(a/b) is ln(a) - ln(b), so f(s) = ln(s+1) - ln(s-1). That might make it easier to handle.

I think I should look for standard Laplace transforms that involve logarithms. Or maybe find a way to express this logarithm in terms of functions whose inverse transforms I know. Oh wait, I remember that the inverse Laplace transform of ln(s) is related to the gamma function, but I'm not sure if that helps here.

Alternatively, maybe I can express the logarithm as an integral or a series expansion. Let me think about another approach. Oh, the derivative of ln(s+1) with respect to s is 1/(s+1), and similarly for ln(s-1), the derivative is 1/(s-1). So maybe if I take the derivative of f(s), I can get something more manageable.

Wait, but I'm looking for the inverse Laplace transform, so perhaps differentiation in the Laplace domain could be useful. Oh right, the inverse Laplace transform of f'(s) is -t F(t), where F(t) is the inverse of f(s). But I'm not sure if that's the right path here.

Another thought: Maybe I can write the logarithm as an integral. I recall that ln(a) = ∫ from 1 to a (1/x) dx. So perhaps I can represent f(s) as an integral, then take the inverse Laplace transform term by term. But I'm not sure how to proceed with that.

Wait, another idea. Since f(s) is the logarithm of a ratio, maybe I can express it as the integral of some function. Let me think about the integral of (1/(s+1)) or similar terms. Hmm.

Wait, another approach: Partial fractions. Maybe I can break down the logarithm into something that can be expressed as a sum of terms which I can take the inverse Laplace of. Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that ln((s+1)/(s-1)) is the same as 2 * artanh(1/s) or something like that? Because artanh(x) is (1/2) ln((1+x)/(1-x)). Let me check that.

Artanh(x) is defined as ½ ln[(1+x)/(1−x)]. So if I have ln[(s+1)/(s−1)], that's like 2 * artanh(s/(1))? Wait, no, because in artanh, the argument is x. Let me think: Let me set x = s, but then artanh(s) would involve ln[(1+s)/(1-s)]. Hmm, but in our case, it's (s+1)/(s-1). Oh wait, that can be rewritten as (s+1)/(s-1) = [ (s-1) + 2 ]/(s-1) ) = 1 + 2/(s-1). Not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe I can factor it as:

ln[(s+1)/(s-1)] = ln[(s-1 + 2)/(s-1)] = ln(1 + 2/(s-1)).

Hmm, that looks like the expansion ln(1 + x) where x = 2/(s-1). But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Wait, maybe another substitution. Let u = s -1. Then s = u +1, and the expression becomes ln[(u+2)/u] = ln(1 + 2/u). So f(s) = f(u+1) = ln(1 + 2/u). But u = s-1, so u = s -1.

I'm not sure if that's helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the series expansion of the logarithm. The Taylor series for ln(1+x) is x - x²/2 + x³/3 - x⁴/4 + ... for |x| < 1. But in our case, x would be 2/(s-1), so for convergence, |2/(s-1)| < 1, which would require that |s-1| > 2. But the problem states that s >1, so maybe this isn't valid for all s in that domain. Hmm, that might complicate things, but perhaps the expansion could still be useful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the inverse Laplace transform by recognizing a known form. Let me think of the Laplace transforms I know. For example, the Laplace transform of e^(at) is 1/(s - a), so maybe if I can express f(s) in terms that involve 1/(s - a), that would help. But f(s) is a logarithm, not a rational function.

Wait, another thought: The Laplace transform of (sinh(at))/t is (1/2) ln[(s+a)/(s-a)], right? Because I think that the Laplace transform of sinh(at)/t is (1/2) ln[(s+a)/(s-a)]. So if that's the case, then maybe the inverse Laplace transform of ln[(s+a)/(s-a)] is 2 sinh(at) / t.

Wait, let's check that. Suppose L{f(t)} = F(s) = ln[(s + a)/(s - a)] / 2. Then f(t) would be (1/2) * inverse of ln[(s+a)/(s−a)], which according to the thought would be sinh(at)/t. So then the inverse of ln[(s+a)/(s−a)] would be 2 sinh(at)/t.

In our problem, the function is ln[(s+1)/(s-1)] which can be written as ln[(s +1)/(s -1)] = ln[(s - (-1))/(s - 1)]. So a would be 1, so applying that formula, the inverse Laplace transform would be 2 sinh(1 * t)/t. So f(t) = (2 sinh t)/t.

Looking at the options, option D is (2 sinh t)/t. Option B is (2 sinh t)/t². So that would be option D.

Wait, let me make sure. I'm pretty sure that L{sinh(at)/t} = (1/2) ln[(s +a)/(s -a)]. So if that's correct, then the inverse would be 2 sinh(at)/t. So for a=1, that's 2 sinh t/t, which is option D.

Alternatively, perhaps I should verify this. Let me compute the Laplace transform of (2 sinh t)/t and see if it gives ln[(s+1)/(s-1)].

The Laplace transform of sinh(t) is 1/(s² -1). But wait, the Laplace transform of sinh(at) is a/(s² - a²). So the Laplace transform of sinh(t) is 1/(s² -1). But if I have sinh(t)/t, that's different. So perhaps I can compute L{sinh(t)/t}.

I think that L{sinh(at)/t} = (1/(2a)) ln[(s +a)/(s -a)]. So for a=1, L{sinh(t)/t} = (1/2) ln[(s+1)/(s-1)]. Therefore, if I multiply by 2, I get L{2 sinh(t)/t} = ln[(s+1)/(s-1)], which matches the given function. So yes, the inverse Laplace transform of ln[(s+1)/(s-1)] is (2 sinh t)/t, which is option D.

To find the inverse Laplace transform of \( f(s) = \ln\left(\frac{s+1}{s-1}\right) \) for \( s > 1 \), we start by recognizing that the logarithmic function can be expressed in terms of hyperbolic functions. Specifically, the natural logarithm can be related to the inverse hyperbolic tangent function:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{s+1}{s-1}\right) = 2 \cdot \text{artanh}\left(\frac{1}{s}\right).
\]

However, a more direct approach is to recall the Laplace transform of the hyperbolic sine function divided by \( t \). The Laplace transform of \( \frac{\sinh(at)}{t} \) is given by:

\[
\mathcal{L}\left\{\frac{\sinh(at)}{t}\right\} = \frac{1}{2} \ln\left(\frac{s+a}{s-a}\right).
\]

For \( a = 1 \), this becomes:

\[
\mathcal{L}\left\{\frac{\sinh(t)}{t}\right\} = \frac{1}{2} \ln\left(\frac{s+1}{s-1}\right).
\]

Thus, to obtain the Laplace transform of \( \ln\left(\frac{s+1}{s-1}\right) \), we multiply by 2:

\[
\mathcal{L}\left\{\frac{2 \sinh(t)}{t}\right\} = \ln\left(\frac{s+1}{s-1}\right).
\]

This implies that the inverse Laplace transform of \( \ln\left(\frac{s+1}{s-1}\right) \) is:

\[
f(t) = \frac{2 \sinh(t)}{t}.
\]

Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

**D: \( \frac{2 \sinh t}{t} \)**.

Other options, such as \( \frac{2 \sinh t}{t^2} \) (option B), do not match the derived result. Therefore, the correct choice is:

**D**
