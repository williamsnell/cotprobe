Question:

One afternoon, a pilot was flying a small airplane when it suddenly ran out of gas. As he was coming in for an emergency landing, the plane crossed into a neighboring state at a very low altitude. At this time, a 9-year-old boy was walking to school when he was struck and injured by an object, which may have fallen from the plane. In federal court, a negligence suit was brought against the pilot by the father of the boy for his son. Accompanied by his father, the boy had visited an attorney for preliminary discussions regarding the case. However, the father did not retain the attorney to represent his son in the lawsuit. Instead, the father hired another lawyer to handle the case. At trial, the pilot's attorney calls the consulting attorney to testify what the boy had said to him regarding his physical condition during the consultation that the attorney had had with the boy and his father. The attorney's testimony is

Options:

A: admissible, because the father did not retain the consulting attorney, thus nullifying any privilege.
B: inadmissible, because it was a statement of physical condition not made for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment.
C: inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege prevents such a breach of confidential communications.
D: inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege is maintained even if a different attorney is hired.
E: admissible, because the lawsuit makes all previous communications related to the case public.
F: admissible, because the boy was not the attorney's client, only the father was.
G: admissible, because there is no privilege of confidentiality when a person other than the client is present at the attorney-client consultation.
H: admissible, because the attorney-client privilege was waived by the filing of the lawsuit.
I: inadmissible, because the consultation was preliminary and does not constitute a formal attorney-client relationship.
J: inadmissible, because the boy is a minor and cannot legally waive his rights to attorney-client privilege.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence question. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand all the details.

So, the situation is that a pilot's plane ran out of gas, and during an emergency landing, it crossed into another state. A boy was walking to school and got hit by something that might have fallen from the plane. The father is suing the pilot for negligence in federal court. 

Before the lawsuit, the boy and his father went to talk to an attorney for preliminary discussions. But the father didn't hire that attorney; instead, he got another lawyer. At the trial, the pilot's attorney calls this consulting attorney to testify about what the boy said regarding his physical condition during that initial consultation. The question is whether this testimony is admissible.

Hmm, the issue here is about attorney-client privilege. I remember that attorney-client privilege protects confidential communications between a client and their attorney made during legal consultation. But there are exceptions and certain conditions that can affect this privilege.

First, who is the client here? The father brought the boy to the attorney, but the father didn't retain the attorney. So the consulting attorney wasn't representing the boy or the father. I think that the attorney-client relationship is typically formed when the attorney agrees to represent the client. If the father didn't hire the attorney, then maybe there's no attorney-client relationship.

Wait, but the boy was present during the consultation. Does that matter? I think that if the attorney is consulting with someone about becoming a client, even if they don't end up hiring the attorney, the initial consultation might still be privileged. Because the purpose was to seek legal advice. 

But I'm a bit confused. I remember that for the privilege to apply, the communication must be made during a legal consultation, and the client must have a reasonable expectation that the communication is confidential. Here, the father was talking to the attorney about the case, but didn't hire them. So maybe the initial consultation is still privileged.

Wait, but the boy was present. So when the attorney spoke with the boy and his father, was that a confidential communication? Or does the presence of a third party (the boy) affect the privilege? No, because the boy is the one who's the potential client (since he's the victim). Or is the father the client? Because the father is the one bringing the suit on behalf of the boy.

Wait, the father is the one who's suing on behalf of his son, so maybe the father is the client. So when the father and son met with the attorney, the father was the prospective client, and the son was there as part of that. So any communications made during that meeting would be between the attorney and the prospective client (father) and the son. 

If the attorney wasn't hired, does that mean the privilege doesn't apply? I think the initial consultation is still privileged because the purpose was to seek legal advice. The fact that the attorney wasn't retained doesn't negate the confidentiality of the discussion. So the attorney can't testify about what was said during that consultation.

Wait, but the question is about the boy's statements. So the boy's statements to the attorney during the consultation. If the attorney was consulting with the father as the client, then the boy's statements might be covered under the privilege if they were made in the course of the legal consultation.

Alternatively, if the boy was the client, but the father didn't retain the attorney, but the initial discussion was confidential. So the attorney can't disclose what the boy said.

Looking at the answer options:

Option C says it's inadmissible because attorney-client privilege prevents breach. But if the attorney wasn't retained, does that matter? I think the initial consultation is still privileged.

Option D: inadmissible because the privilege remains even if another attorney is hired. That makes sense because the privilege isn't about who the attorney is, but the communication itself.

Option F: admissible because the boy wasn't the client, only the father. But if the father was the client, then the boy's statements might be part of the privileged communication.

Wait, but can the attorney disclose what the boy said if the father didn't hire him? I'm a bit stuck.

Another angle: under the Federal Rules of Evidence, statements made during an initial consultation with a lawyer can be privileged even if the lawyer isn't retained. So the fact that the father didn't hire the attorney doesn't make the communication non-privileged.

So in this case, the consulting attorney can't testify about what the boy said because it's protected by attorney-client privilege. So the testimony would be inadmissible.

Looking at the options, option C says it's inadmissible because of attorney-client privilege. Option D says it's inadmissible because the privilege remains even if another attorney is hired. So which is correct?

Wait, the question is about whether the attorney can testify about the boy's statements. The boy was present during the consultation, and the father was considering hiring the attorney. So the communication was confidential. Therefore, the attorney shouldn't be allowed to testify.

So the correct answer should be that it's inadmissible because of attorney-client privilege, regardless of whether the attorney was hired. So option C or D.

Option C is about the confidentiality of the communication. Option D says the privilege remains even if another attorney is hired. So the key is that the initial consultation is privileged, and the fact that the attorney wasn't hired doesn't affect it.

So the answer would be either C or D.

Wait, but another point: the presence of the father and the boy. Attorney-client privilege applies when the communication is made to seek legal advice. The father took the boy to consult the attorney. So the boy's statements would be part of the confidential communication.

Another thought: the attorney can't disclose what the client says during consultation, regardless of whether they're hired. So the consulting attorney is bound by privilege not to disclose the boy's statements.

So among the options, option C and D are possible.

Option C says it's inadmissible because of the attorney-client privilege preventing breach of confidential communications. Option D says it's inadmissible because the privilege is maintained even if another attorney is hired.

Wait, the question is whether the attorney can testify about the boy's statements. The privilege applies to the communications made during the consultation. So the consulting attorney can't testify about the statements, regardless of who the attorney is. So the testimony is inadmissible. So the correct answer would be either C or D.

Alternatively, maybe the father was the client, and the boy's statements were made in the father's presence, so they are protected.

Wait, let me think about the elements of the attorney-client privilege. The communication must be made in confidence, for the purpose of seeking legal advice. If the father and son went to the attorney for legal advice, and the son made statements during that meeting, those statements are protected.

Therefore, the consulting attorney cannot testify about the boy's statements because they're protected under the attorney-client privilege. So the answer is inadmissible.

Looking at the options, option C says it's inadmissible because of attorney-client privilege preventing breach. Option D is similar but focuses on even if another attorney is hired.

So the correct answer should be C or D. Which one?

The question is whether the privilege applies because the father didn't retain the attorney. The fact that the attorney was not retained doesn't affect the privilege; the initial consultation is still protected. So option C says it's inadmissible because of the attorney-client privilege preventing breach. So the answer would be C.

Wait, but another point: the presence of the boy. If the client (father) brings a third party (the boy), does that break the privilege? No, because the third party was necessary for the consultation. So the presence of the boy doesn't waive the privilege.

So, considering all that, the testimony is inadmissible due to attorney-client privilege. So the answer should be C or D.

Wait, option D says the privilege is maintained even if another attorney is hired. That's correct because the privilege isn't about which attorney is handling the case but about the communication itself. So even if the father hired another attorney, the consulting attorney can't disclose the communication.

So the answer would be D: inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege is maintained even if a different attorney is hired.

Alternatively, perhaps option F: admissible because the boy wasn't the client, only the father was. But that's not correct because the boy's statements were part of the consultation between the father and the attorney, so they're still privileged.

So I think the correct answer is D.

The question revolves around whether the consulting attorney's testimony about the boy's statements during a preliminary consultation is admissible. The key issue is the application of the attorney-client privilege, which protects confidential communications made during legal consultations. 

The father and son met with the attorney for preliminary discussions, but the father did not retain the attorney. However, the attorney-client privilege applies to confidential communications made during legal consultations, regardless of whether the attorney is ultimately hired. The boy's statements during the consultation were part of this confidential communication, and the presence of the boy does not negate the privilege, as he was there to assist in the legal discussion.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option C**: Correctly states that the testimony is inadmissible because the attorney-client privilege prevents the breach of confidential communications. This aligns with the principle that initial consultations are protected, even if the attorney is not retained.
- **Option D**: Also correct, as it emphasizes that the privilege remains even if another attorney is hired. The privilege is not dependent on which attorney handles the case but on the confidentiality of the communication itself.
- Other options, such as **Option F**, are incorrect because the boy's statements were part of the confidential communication between the father (prospective client) and the attorney, and thus are protected.

Between **C** and **D**, **D** is more precise because it highlights that the privilege is maintained regardless of whether a different attorney is hired, which directly addresses the scenario in the question.

**Answer: D**
