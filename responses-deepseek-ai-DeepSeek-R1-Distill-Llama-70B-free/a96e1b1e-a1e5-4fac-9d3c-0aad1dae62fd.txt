Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a dynamo and a steam engine. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my thermodynamics, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the question says a dynamo is driven by a steam engine. The steam engine uses 10^3 kg of coal per day. The dynamo produces a current of 200 A at an electromotive force (emf) of 240 V. We need to find the efficiency of the system. The calorific value of coal is given as 6.6 × 10^3 cal per gram. Oh wait, that's 6.6e3 cal/g. 

Wait, efficiency usually means the output energy over the input energy, right? So efficiency = (useful output) / (total input) * 100%. But I need to find both the output and the input.

The output here is the electrical energy produced by the dynamo. Dynamo's output is electrical power, so P = V * I. So V is 240 V, I is 200 A. So P = 240 * 200 = 48,000 watts. Because power is volts times amps. 

Wait, but power is in watts, and energy is power multiplied by time. So I need to find the energy per day. Since the dynamo is producing this power continuously, I guess for a day. So one day is 24 hours, which is 24 * 3600 seconds. Let me calculate that: 24 * 3600 = 86400 seconds.

So the energy output is power multiplied by time: 48,000 W * 86400 s. Let's compute that. 48,000 * 86,400. Wait, that's a big number. Let me see: 48,000 * 86,400 = 48 * 10^3 * 86.4 * 10^3 = (48 * 86.4) * 10^6. Calculating 48 * 86.4: 40*86.4=3456, 8*86.4=691.2, so total is 3456+691.2=4147.2. So 4147.2e6 joules. Since 1 watt-second is 1 joule.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the exponents. 48,000 is 4.8e4, 86,400 is 8.64e4. So 4.8e4 * 8.64e4 = (4.8 *8.64) e8. 4.8 *8 is 38.4, 4.8 *0.64=3.072. So 38.4 +3.072=41.472. So 41.472e8 joules. Which is 4.1472e9 J. Yeah, that matches the earlier figure.

So the output energy is 4.1472e9 joules per day.

Now, the input is the energy from the coal. The calorific value is the energy released per gram of coal. So they used 10^3 kg of coal per day. Oh wait, 1 kg is 1000 grams, so 10^3 kg is 1e6 grams. Because 10^3 kg = 1000 kg, and 1 kg = 1000 g, so 1000 * 1000 = 1e6 grams.

So the total energy input from coal is the mass in grams multiplied by the calorific value. So 1e6 grams * 6.6e3 cal/g. Let me compute that. 1e6 * 6.6e3 = 6.6e9 cal. Wait, but calories to joules. I remember that 1 cal is approximately 4.184 joules. So 6.6e9 cal * 4.184 J/cal = ?

Let me compute that. 6.6e9 *4.184 = Let's compute 6e9 *4.184=2.5104e10, and 0.6e9 *4.184= 2.5104e9. So total is 2.5104e10 + 2.5104e9 = 2.76128e10 joules.

Wait, let me do it more accurately. 6.6e9 cal * 4.184 J/cal = 6.6 *4.184 * 1e9 *1 = Let's compute 6 *4.184=25.104, 0.6*4.184=2.5104. So total is 25.104 + 2.5104 = 27.6144. So 27.6144e9 J, which is 2.76144e10 J.

So input energy is 2.76144e10 J.

Efficiency is (output/input)*100. So that's (4.1472e9) / (2.76144e10) ) *100.

Let me compute 4.1472e9 / 2.76144e10 = (4.1472 / 27.6144) ) * (1e9 / 1e10) ) = (approx 0.15) * 0.1 = approximately 0.015, or 1.5%. Wait, that's way too low. But that can't be right because the options are 5% up.

Wait, wait, I must have messed up the exponents somewhere. Let me check.

Wait, output is 4.1472e9 J.

Input is 2.76144e10 J.

So 4.1472e9 / 2.76144e10 = (4.1472 / 2.76144 ) * (1e9 / 1e10) ) → 4.1472/2.76144 is about 1.5, and 1e-1 → 0.15. So 0.15 → 15% efficiency. Hmm, that's an option. Option A is 15%.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me recalculate the numbers more accurately.

First, the output energy:

Power P = V * I = 240 V * 200 A = 48,000 W.

Energy per day: 48,000 W * 86400 s = ?

48,000 * 86,400.

Let me compute 48 * 86.4 first.

48 * 80 = 3840, 48 *6.4=307.2. So 3840 +307.2=4147.2.

So 48,000 *86,400 = 4147.2 *1e6 = 4.1472e9 J.

Input energy:

Coal used: 10^3 kg =1e3 kg. Wait wait wait, wait a second. Wait, 10^3 kg is 1000 kg. So 1000 kg is 1e6 grams, because 1 kg =1e3 grams. So 1e3 kg = 1e6 grams.

Calorific value is 6.6e3 cal/g.

So energy input: 1e6 g *6.6e3 cal/g =6.6e9 cal.

Convert calories to joules: 6.6e9 cal *4.184 J/cal=6.6 *4.184=27.6144, so 27.6144e9 J =2.76144e10 J.

So efficiency is (4.1472e9) / (2.76144e10) ) *100.

Compute numerator: 4.1472e9 =4.1472 *1e9.

Denominator: 2.76144e10 =2.76144 *1e10.

So 4.1472e9 /2.76144e10 = (4.1472 / 2.76144) * (1e9 /1e10 )= (1.5) * (0.1) )=0.15.

Multiply by 100, gives 15% efficiency.

So the answer should be 15%, which is option A.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. Let me recompute 4.1472e9 divided by 2.76144e10.

4.1472e9 =4.1472 *1e9.

2.76144e10=2.76144 *1e10.

So 4.1472 / 2.76144 = let me compute this division.

Let me compute 4.1472 ÷ 2.76144.

Dividing both numbers by 1e-5: 41472 ÷ 27614.4.

Wait, 27614.4 *1.5 = 41,421.6. That's a bit higher than 41,472. So 1.5 is about the value. Let me see:

27614.4 *1.5 = 41,421.6.

The numerator is 41,472, which is 50.4 higher than 41,421.6. So 50.4 /27614.4 ≈ 0.0018. So the division is approximately 1.5018. So 1.5018, approximately 1.5.

So 1.5 * 1e-1 (because 1e9 /1e10 is 0.1) → 0.15, so 15%.

Yes, that seems correct. So the efficiency is 15%, which is option A.

To determine the efficiency of the system, we calculate the ratio of the useful electrical energy output to the total energy input from the coal.

### Step 1: Electrical Energy Output
The dynamo produces a current \( I = 200 \, \text{A} \) at an emf \( V = 240 \, \text{V} \), so the power is:
\[
P = V \cdot I = 240 \, \text{W} \cdot 200 \, \text{A} = 48,000 \, \text{W}.
\]
Over a day (24 hours), the energy output is:
\[
\text{Energy Output} = P \cdot \text{time} = 48,000 \, \text{W} \cdot 86,400 \, \text{s} = 4.1472 \times 10^9 \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 2: Energy Input from Coal
The steam engine uses \( 10^3 \, \text{kg} \) of coal per day. Converting this to grams:
\[
10^3 \, \text{kg} = 10^6 \, \text{g}.
\]
The calorific value of coal is \( 6.6 \times 10^3 \, \text{cal/g} \), so the total energy input is:
\[
\text{Energy Input} = \text{mass} \cdot \text{calorific value} = 10^6 \, \text{g} \cdot 6.6 \times 10^3 \, \text{cal/g} = 6.6 \times 10^9 \, \text{cal}.
\]
Converting calories to joules (\( 1 \, \text{cal} = 4.184 \, \text{J} \)):
\[
\text{Energy Input} = 6.6 \times 10^9 \, \text{cal} \cdot 4.184 \, \text{J/cal} = 2.76144 \times 10^{10} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 3: Efficiency
The efficiency is the ratio of the output energy to the input energy:
\[
\text{Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Energy Output}}{\text{Energy Input}} \cdot 100 = \frac{4.1472 \times 10^9}{2.76144 \times 10^{10}} \cdot 100.
\]
Simplifying:
\[
\text{Efficiency} = \frac{4.1472}{2.76144} \cdot \frac{1 \times 10^9}{1 \times 10^{10}} \cdot 100 = 1.5 \cdot 0.1 \cdot 100 = 15\%.
\]

### Final Answer
The efficiency of the system is **15%**, which corresponds to option **A**.
