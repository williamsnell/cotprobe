Question:

Let X be the random variable denoting the result of the single toss of a fair coin. If the toss is heads, X = 1. If the toss results in tails, X = 0. What is the probability distribution of X?

Options:

A: f(0) = (0) and f(1) = (1)
B: f(0) = (1/2) and f(1) = (1/2)
C: f(0) = (1) and f(1) = (0)
D: f(0) = (1/6) and f(1) = (5/6)
E: f(0) = (2/5) and f(1) = (3/5)
F: f(0) = (3/7) and f(1) = (4/7)
G: f(0) = (1/5) and f(1) = (4/5)
H: f(0) = (1/4) and f(1) = (3/4)
I: f(0) = (1/3) and f(1) = (2/3)
J: f(0) = (3/8) and f(1) = (5/8)

Okay, so I've got this probability question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. The question is about a random variable X, which represents the outcome of a single toss of a fair coin. If the toss is heads, X is 1, and if it's tails, X is 0. I need to find the probability distribution of X from the given options.

Hmm, right. So a fair coin has two possible outcomes, each with equal chance. I remember that for a fair coin, the probability of heads is 0.5, and tails is also 0.5. So in this case, since X is 1 for heads and 0 for tails, the probabilities should be the same for both outcomes.

Wait, what's a probability distribution exactly? Oh, right, it's a function that gives the probabilities of each possible outcome of the random variable. So for X, which can be 0 or 1, I need to assign probabilities to each.

So, f(0) is the probability that X equals 0, which is tails. Since the coin is fair, that's 1/2. Similarly, f(1) is the probability that X is 1, which is heads, also 1/2.

Looking at the options, option B says f(0)=1/2 and f(1)=1/2. That seems to match what I just thought. Let me double-check the other options just to be sure.

Option A has f(0)=0 and f(1)=1, which would mean the coin always lands on heads, but that's not the case for a fair coin. Option C is the opposite, where f(0)=1 and f(1)=0, which would mean the coin always lands tailsâ€”again, not fair.

The other options have different fractions, like 1/6 and 5/6, but those don't add up to 1 when considering two outcomes. Wait, actually, let me think: all options have two probabilities that add to 1, except maybe some? Hmm, looking again:

Option D adds 1/6 +5/6=1, E adds 2/5 +3/5=1, same with F:3/7+4/7=1, and so on. So all the options are valid probability distributions where the two outcomes sum to 1. But the question is about a fair coin, so each outcome should have equal probability.

So the only option where both are 1/2 is option B. That's got to be the correct answer.

I think I've got it. The probability distribution of X assigns 0.5 to both 0 and 1. So the answer should be B.

The random variable \( X \) represents the outcome of a single toss of a fair coin, where \( X = 1 \) for heads and \( X = 0 \) for tails. Since the coin is fair, the probability of heads is \( \frac{1}{2} \), and the probability of tails is also \( \frac{1}{2} \). Therefore, the probability distribution of \( X \) assigns \( f(0) = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( f(1) = \frac{1}{2} \).

Among the given options, only option B satisfies this condition. All other options assign unequal probabilities to the two outcomes, which would not be valid for a fair coin. Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: B**
