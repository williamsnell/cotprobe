Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the dissociation energy for LiH. Hmm, let's see what the question says. The given data includes D0, which is the ground electronic state dissociation energy, and some spectroscopic constants. Oh right, the last two are ν_e over c and ν_e x_e over c, which I think correspond to ω_e and ω_e x_e. 

Wait, I remember that dissociation energy has two forms: D0 and De. D0 is the spectroscopic dissociation energy, which is the energy required to break the bond into atoms in their lowest energy states, but it's measured from the lowest vibrational level (v=0). De, on the other hand, is the dissociation energy from the minimum of the potential well, so it includes the zero-point energy. 

Right, the formula connecting D0 and De involves the vibrational constants. Oh yeah, the formula is D0 = De - (1/2) hbar ω_e (1 - 2 x_e) + ... Wait, no, maybe I should think in terms of the vibrational energy levels. 

Wait, I think the correct relation is that the zero-point energy (ZPE) is (1/2) ω_e. But because of anharmonicity, there's a correction factor. Oh right, the ZPE is (1/2) ω_e, but then the anharmonicity term comes into play. So the total ZPE is (1/2) ω_e - (1/2) ω_e x_e. Or wait, maybe it's (1/2) ω_e (1 - 2 x_e) ?

Let me get this straight. The vibrational energy levels of a diatomic molecule are modeled by the Morse potential, right? And the energy levels are given by G(v) = ω_e (v + 1/2) - ω_e x_e (v + 1/2)^2. So the zero-point energy (v=0) is G(0) = (ω_e / 2) - (ω_e x_e / 2)(1/4) ? No, wait, (v+1/2) for v=0 is 1/2. So (1/2)^2 is 1/4. So G(0) = (ω_e / 2)(1 - x_e (1/2)). Hmm, maybe I'm complicating myself.

Wait, I think the correct formula is D0 = De - (1/2) ω_e + (1/2) ω_e x_e. Because the ZPE is (1/2 ω_e), but with anharmonicity, it's adjusted. Or maybe it's D0 = De - (1/2 ω_e)(1 - 2 x_e). No, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, I remember that the dissociation energy from the minimum, De, is related to D0 by D0 = De - (energy of the vibrational ground state). The ground state vibrational energy is (1/2) ω_e (1 - 2 x_e). Or is it (1/2 ω_e) minus some term involving x_e?

Wait, I think the ground state vibrational energy is (1/2) ω_e minus (1/2 ω_e x_e). Because the energy levels are G(v) = ω_e (v + 1/2) - ω_e x_e (v + 1/2)^2. So for v=0, G(0) = (ω_e/2) - ω_e x_e (1/2)^2. So that's (ω_e/2) - (ω_e x_e /4). So the ZPE is (ω_e/2) (1 - x_e/2). 

Wait, but that might not be directly correct. Let me think again. The expression for G(v) is often written as G(v) = ω_e (v + 1/2) - ω_e x_e (v + 1/2)^2. So for v=0, it's (ω_e/2) - (ω_e x_e/4) * (something). Let me compute that: G(0) = (ω_e/2) - ω_e x_e * (1/2)^2 = (ω_e/2) - (ω_e x_e)/4. 

So the total vibrational energy in the ground state is (ω_e/2) (1 - x_e/2). Hmm, but I'm trying to find the relation between D0 and De. Oh right, D0 is the dissociation energy starting from the lowest vibrational level (v=0). So D0 = De - G(0). Because De is the energy from the bottom of the well, and G(0) is the energy of the ground vibrational state relative to the bottom. So if you have to go from v=0 to dissociation, you need De (the total energy needed), but you subtract the ZPE because you're starting higher than the minimum. Wait, no, wait: De is the energy required to dissociate from the minimum, so D0 is the energy to dissociate from v=0, which is De minus the vibrational energy at v=0. So D0 = De - G(0). 

So rearranged, De = D0 + G(0). 

What's G(0) again? Oh right, G(0) is (ω_e/2) - (ω_e x_e/4). So G(0) = (ω_e/2) (1 - x_e/2). 

Wait, but in some sources, I've seen that the correction is D0 = De - (1/2 ω_e)(1 - 2 x_e). Hmm, maybe I should look for the exact formula. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is D0 = De - (1/2) ω_e (1 - 2 x_e). I'm getting a bit stuck here. 

Wait, let me think of it this way: The dissociation energy from the minimum is De. The ground vibrational state is at an energy of (1/2) ω_e above the minimum, but because of the anharmonicity, this is a bit less. So the actual energy is (1/2) ω_e - (1/2) ω_e x_e (1/2). Because the anharmonicity term is (v+1/2)^2 multiplied by ω_e x_e, so for v=0, (1/2)^2 = 1/4. So G(0) = (1/2) ω_e - (1/4) ω_e x_e. 

So G(0) = (ω_e/2) (1 - x_e/2). 

So De is related to D0 by D0 = De - G(0). So De = D0 + G(0).

Plugging in the numbers:

Given D0 = 2.4287 eV.

ν_e / c is given as 1405.65 cm^-1. Oh wait, because ω_e (in cm^-1) is ν_e / c. So ω_e is 1405.65 cm^-1.

Similarly, ν_e x_e / c is 23.20 cm^-1. So ω_e x_e is 23.20 cm^-1.

Wait, but cm^-1 is a unit of energy when multiplied by c (speed of light), but here we have ω_e already in cm^-1. So to get G(0), which is in energy terms, we need to convert cm^-1 to eV.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the units. Let me think: 1 cm^-1 is approximately 0.001986 eV. Because 1 eV is about 8065.5 cm^-1. So 1 cm^-1 is 1 / 8065.5 ≈ 1.24e-4 eV, but wait, maybe I should check the exact conversion.

Wait, Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s. Speed of light c is 3e8 m/s. So E = h c / λ. Wavenumbers (cm^-1) are 1/λ, so E (in J) is h c times the wavenumber. 

But to convert from cm^-1 to eV, let's compute the conversion factor. 

h c = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. 

1 J is 1 kg·m²/s². So 1 J·m = 1 kg·m³/s². Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to compute the energy in eV for 1 cm^-1.

1 cm = 1e-2 m. So 1 cm^-1 is 100 m^-1. 

Wait, E = h c ν̃, where ν̃ is in cm^-1. 

Wait, more accurately, E (in eV) = ν̃ (cm^-1) * (h c) / (eV·cm). Let me compute that.

h is 6.626e-34 J·s.

c is 3e8 m/s = 3e10 cm/s.

So h c is 6.626e-34 * 3e10 cm/s = 1.9878e-23 J·cm.

Since 1 J = 10^7 erg, and 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J.

Wait, let's compute h c in eV·cm.

1 J = 1 kg·m²/s².

h c = 6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 J·m = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Now 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 1 J = 1 / 1.602e-19 eV ≈ 6.242e18 eV.

So 1 J·m = 6.242e18 eV·m.

So h c = 1.9878e-25 J·m = 1.9878e-25 * 6.242e18 eV·m.

Multiply those: 1.9878e-25 * 6.242e18 = (1.9878 * 6.242) x 1e-7.

1.9878 * 6.242 ≈ let's see, 2 *6=12, but precise: 1.9878*6=11.9268; 1.9878*0.242≈ 0.4808. So total ≈ 12.4076. So 12.4076e-7 eV·m.

Wait, that's 1.24076e-6 eV·m. But wait, cm is 1e-2 m. So 1 cm = 1e-2 m, so 1 m = 100 cm. So to get E in eV when given ν̃ in cm^-1, we multiply ν̃ by h c (in eV·cm).

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute the conversion factor from cm^-1 to eV.

1 cm^-1 is equivalent to h c multiplied by the wavenumber, right?

So E (eV) = ν̃ (cm^-1) * h c / (eV conversion).

Alternatively, using the known value that 1 cm^-1 ≈ 0.001986 eV.

Wait, let's compute that: 1 eV = 8065.54 cm^-1. So 1 cm^-1 = 1 / 8065.54 eV ≈ 1.24e-4 eV.

So 1 cm^-1 ≈ 0.000124 eV.

Wait, no, 1 eV = 8065.54 cm^-1. So 1 cm^-1 = 1 / 8065.54 ≈ 1.24e-4 eV. So 0.000124 eV per cm^-1.

So, ω_e is 1405.65 cm^-1. So in eV, that's 1405.65 * 1.24e-4 eV.

Wait, let me compute that. 1405.65 * 1.24e-4.

1405.65 * 1e-4 is 0.140565. Multiply by 1.24: 0.140565 * 1.24.

Calculating:

0.14 * 1.24 = 0.1736.

0.000565 * 1.24 ≈ 0.000565 * 1 = 0.000565; 0.000565 * 0.24≈0.0001356. So total≈0.0007006.

So total is approx 0.1736 + 0.0007006 ≈ 0.1743 eV.

Wait, let me compute 1.24e-4 * 1405.65.

1405.65 * 1.24e-4 = 1405.65 * 0.000124.

1405.65 * 0.0001 is 0.140565.

1405.65 * 0.000024: 1405.65 * 24e-6.

Compute 1405.65 * 24 = 33,735.6; 33,735.6e-6 = 0.0337356.

So total is 0.140565 + 0.0337356 ≈ 0.1743 eV.

So ω_e ≈ 0.1743 eV.

Similarly, ω_e x_e is 23.20 cm^-1. So in eV, that is 23.20 * 1.24e-4.

23.20 * 1.24e-4 = 23.20 * 0.000124.

23.20 * 0.0001 is 0.00232.

23.20 * 0.000024 = 0.0005568.

Summing: 0.00232 + 0.0005568 = 0.0028768 eV.

So ω_e x_e ≈ 0.0028768 eV.

Now, G(0) is (ω_e / 2) - (ω_e x_e / 4).

Wait, no: earlier I thought G(0) = (ω_e/2) - (ω_e x_e / 4). Let me recheck that.

Yes, because G(0) = (v=0) term: ω_e (0 + 1/2) - ω_e x_e (0 + 1/2)^2.

So that's (ω_e / 2) - (ω_e x_e)(1/4).

So G(0) = (ω_e / 2) - (ω_e x_e)/4.

So plugging in the values:

(0.1743 / 2) = 0.08715 eV.

(0.0028768 /4) = 0.0007192 eV.

So G(0) = 0.08715 - 0.0007192 = 0.0864308 eV.

So approximately 0.08643 eV.

Now, since D0 = De - G(0), rearranging gives De = D0 + G(0).

D0 is given as 2.4287 eV.

So De = 2.4287 eV + 0.08643 eV = 2.51513 eV.

Looking at the options, option G is 2.5151 eV. So that's the answer.

To calculate the dissociation energy in the electronic ground state, \( D_e \), for \({ }^7 \mathrm{Li}^1 \mathrm{H}\), we use the relationship:

\[
D_e = D_0 + G(0)
\]

Here, \( D_0 \) is the spectroscopic dissociation energy (given as \( 2.4287 \, \mathrm{eV} \)), and \( G(0) \) is the zero-point energy (ZPE) of the vibrational ground state. The ZPE is calculated using the vibrational constants \( \omega_e \) and \( \omega_e x_e \), which are provided as \( 1405.65 \, \mathrm{cm}^{-1} \) and \( 23.20 \, \mathrm{cm}^{-1} \), respectively. The formula for \( G(0) \) is:

\[
G(0) = \frac{\omega_e}{2} - \frac{\omega_e x_e}{4}
\]

### Step 1: Convert \( \omega_e \) and \( \omega_e x_e \) to eV
To use these constants in energy calculations, they must be converted from \( \mathrm{cm}^{-1} \) to \( \mathrm{eV} \). Using the conversion factor \( 1 \, \mathrm{cm}^{-1} \approx 0.000124 \, \mathrm{eV} \):

\[
\omega_e = 1405.65 \, \mathrm{cm}^{-1} \times 0.000124 \, \mathrm{eV} = 0.1743 \, \mathrm{eV}
\]

\[
\omega_e x_e = 23.20 \, \mathrm{cm}^{-1} \times 0.000124 \, \mathrm{eV} = 0.0028768 \, \mathrm{eV}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( G(0) \)
Substitute \( \omega_e \) and \( \omega_e x_e \) into the formula for \( G(0) \):

\[
G(0) = \frac{\omega_e}{2} - \frac{\omega_e x_e}{4}
\]

\[
G(0) = \frac{0.1743}{2} - \frac{0.0028768}{4}
\]

\[
G(0) = 0.08715 \, \mathrm{eV} - 0.0007192 \, \mathrm{eV} = 0.0864308 \, \mathrm{eV}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( D_e \)
Using \( D_e = D_0 + G(0) \):

\[
D_e = 2.4287 \, \mathrm{eV} + 0.0864308 \, \mathrm{eV} = 2.51513 \, \mathrm{eV}
\]

### Final Answer
The dissociation energy \( D_e \) for \({ }^7 \mathrm{Li}^1 \mathrm{H}\) is approximately \( 2.5151 \, \mathrm{eV} \), which corresponds to option **G**.
