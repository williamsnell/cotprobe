Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about a first-order reaction. Hmm, let's see. The question says the half-life is 34 minutes, and I need to find the rate constant. I'm a bit rusty, but I remember that for first-order reactions, the half-life is related to the rate constant.

Wait, right! The formula for the half-life of a first-order reaction is t₁/₂ = ln(2) / k. Oh yeah, ln(2) is approximately 0.693. So if I rearrange the formula to solve for k, it should be k = ln(2) / t₁/₂.

But wait, the half-life is given in minutes. Do I need to convert that to seconds because the rate constant is usually per second when the time is in seconds? Or does it depend on the units of the answer options? Let me look at the options.

Looking at the options, I see options in both minutes and seconds. For example, option D is in min^-1 and option C in s^-1. So I probably need to calculate k in both units and see which matches.

First, let me calculate k using the given half-life in minutes. So t₁/₂ is 34 minutes. Plugging into the formula: k = 0.693 / 34. Let me compute that. 0.693 divided by 34. Hmm, 34 times 0.02 is 0.68, so 0.693 is a little more. So 0.693 /34 is approximately 0.02038 min^-1. Let me check that division. 34 * 0.02 is 0.68. 0.68 + (34*0.00038) equals 0.68 + 0.01292 = 0.69292, which is about 0.693. So yeah, k ≈ 0.02038 min^-1.

Looking at the options, option E is 6.8e-2 min^-1, which is 0.068. That's bigger than my number. Option D is 2.9e-1, which is 0.29, way too big. Option G is 1.02e-1, which is 0.102, also bigger. Hmm, none of these match 0.02038. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion.

Ah, wait! Maybe the options are in per second. Let me recalculate k in per second units. Since the half-life is 34 minutes, I should convert that to seconds. 34 minutes is 34 * 60 = 2040 seconds.

So k = 0.693 / 2040. Let me compute that. 0.693 / 2040. Let's see, 2040 is about 2000, so 0.693/2000 is 0.0003465. But 2040 is 2% more than 2000, so the actual value is a bit less. Let me compute it accurately.

0.693 divided by 2040. Let me write it as 693e-3 / 2040. Hmm, 693 divided by 2040. Let me see, 2040 * 0.00034 is 0.6936? Wait, 2040 * 0.0003 is 0.612, and 0.00004 is 0.0816, so 0.6936 is 0.612 + 0.0816 = 0.6936, which is very close to 0.693. So 0.00034 is 3.4e-4 s^-1.

Looking back at the options, option C is 3.4e-4 s^-1. That matches. So the correct answer must be C.

Wait, but let me double-check. Let me compute 0.693 / 2040 more accurately. 2040 * 0.0003 is 0.612. Subtract that from 0.693, we have 0.081 left. 0.081 / 2040 is approximately 0.0000397. So total is 0.0003 + 0.0000397 = 0.0003397, which is about 3.397e-4 s^-1. So approximately 3.4e-4, which is option C.

But wait, another option is option I: 2.04e-2 s^-1. That's way bigger. So no, I think option C is correct.

To determine the rate constant \( k \) for a first-order reaction with a half-life of 34 minutes, we use the formula:

\[
t_{1/2} = \frac{\ln(2)}{k}
\]

Rearranging for \( k \):

\[
k = \frac{\ln(2)}{t_{1/2}}
\]

Here, \( \ln(2) \approx 0.693 \). The half-life is given as 34 minutes, so:

\[
k = \frac{0.693}{34} \approx 0.02038 \, \text{min}^{-1}
\]

However, the answer options include both minutes and seconds. To match the units of the options, we convert \( t_{1/2} \) to seconds:

\[
34 \, \text{minutes} = 34 \times 60 = 2040 \, \text{seconds}
\]

Now calculate \( k \) in seconds:

\[
k = \frac{0.693}{2040} \approx 0.0003397 \, \text{s}^{-1} \approx 3.4 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{s}^{-1}
\]

Comparing this result to the options:

- **Option C**: \( 3.4 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{s}^{-1} \) matches perfectly.
- Other options are either in incorrect units or have incorrect magnitudes.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**C: \( 3.4 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{s}^{-1} \)**
