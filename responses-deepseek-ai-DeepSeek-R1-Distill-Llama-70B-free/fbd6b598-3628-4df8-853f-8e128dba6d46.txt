Okay, so I have this physics problem here about neutron capture by silver. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says: The cross section for neutrons of energy 10 eV being captured by silver is 17 barns. What is the probability of a neutron being captured as it passes through a layer of silver 2 mm thick?

Wait, cross section, right. I remember that the cross section is a measure of the probability that a certain interaction will happen, like capture in this case. But I think I need to relate this to the actual probability of the neutron being captured when moving through the silver.

Oh right, the formula for the probability is P = 1 - e^(-nσx), where n is the number of target nuclei per unit volume, σ is the cross section, and x is the thickness of the material. But wait, do I have all the necessary values here?

Hmm, let's see. The problem gives me the cross section σ as 17 barns. But wait, barns are a unit of area. 1 barn is 1e-24 cm². So 17 barns would be 17e-24 cm².

But to compute nσx, I need to know n, the number density of silver atoms, and x, the thickness. Wait, the thickness is given as 2 mm, which is 0.2 cm.

Wait, but I don't have the density or the atomic mass of silver. Oh wait, I think I can get these from standard properties. Silver has an atomic number around 108, and its atomic weight is about 108 g/mol. Oh wait, but the density of silver is approximately 10.5 g/cm³, I think.

Right, so first I need to find the number of silver atoms per cm³. Number density n is (density * Avogadro's number) / molar mass. Let me calculate that.

Density ρ is 10.5 g/cm³. Molar mass M is 108 g/mol. Avogadro's number N_A is 6.022e23 atoms/mol.

So n = (ρ * N_A) / M = (10.5 g/cm³ * 6.022e23 atoms/mol) / (108 g/mol) 

Let's compute that. 10.5 / 108 is approximately 0.09722. Multiply by 6.022e23: 0.09722 * 6.022e23 ≈ 5.85e22 atoms/cm³.

Wait, but wait, maybe I should be more precise. Let me compute 10.5 divided by 108.

10.5 / 108 = (21/2) / 108 = 21/(2*108) = 21/216 = 7/72 ≈ 0.097222... So yes, 0.09722. Then 0.09722 * 6.022e23 = ?

0.09722 * 6.022 is approximately 0.5853, so 0.5853e23 = 5.853e22 atoms/cm³.

So n ≈ 5.85e22 cm⁻³.

Now, σ is 17 barns, which is 17e-24 cm².

The product nσ is 5.85e22 cm⁻³ * 17e-24 cm² = let's calculate that.

Multiply 5.85e22 by 17e-24.

5.85 *17 = let's see, 5*17=85, 0.85*17=14.45, so total 99.45. Then 1e22 * 1e-24 is 1e-2. So 99.45e-2 = 0.9945.

So nσ ≈ 0.9945 cm⁻¹.

Wait wait, no. Wait, cm² (from σ) multiplied by cm⁻³ (from n) gives cm⁻¹. Oh right, because (1/cm³)(cm²) = 1/cm.

So nσ is 0.9945 per cm.

Then, the thickness x is 0.2 cm.

So the product nσx is 0.9945 * 0.2 = 0.1989.

So the exponent in the probability formula is -nσx, which would be -0.1989.

So P = 1 - e^(-0.1989) 

Now, e^0.2 is approximately 1.2214. So e^0.1989 is about 1.2205.

So e^(-0.1989) is approximately 1/1.2205 ≈ 0.819.

Then P ≈ 1 - 0.819 = 0.181.

So the probability is approximately 18.1%.

Looking at the options, option J is 0.2, which is 20%. The closest to 18% would be option J.

Wait, but my approximation might not be precise. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of n. Let me go through that again.

Density of silver is 10.5 g/cm³. Molar mass is 107.87 g/mol (more accurately), but I'll stick with 108 for simplicity.

n = (10.5 g/cm³) * (6.022e23 atoms/mol) / (108 g/mol) 

10.5 /108 = 0.097222...

0.097222 * 6.022e23 = let's compute 0.097222 *6.022 = ?

0.09 *6.022 is 0.54198; 0.007222 *6.022≈0.0435. So total ≈ 0.54198 + 0.0435 = 0.58548.

So 0.58548e23 = 5.8548e22 cm⁻³.

nσ = 5.8548e22 cm⁻³ * 17e-24 cm² = (5.8548 *17) * 1e-2 

5.8548 *17 = 5*17=85, 0.8548*17=14.5416 → total 99.5416. So 99.5416 * 1e-2 = 0.995416 cm⁻¹.

Then x = 0.2 cm. So nσx = 0.995416 *0.2 = 0.199083.

So exponent is -0.199083.

e^-0.199083 → let's calculate this more accurately.

I know that ln(2) is about 0.6931, but perhaps I can use a Taylor expansion for e^-x around x=0.2.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator-like approach mentally.

e^0.2 is approximately 1.2214, as I thought before. Then 0.199 is close to 0.2. So e^-0.199 ≈ 1/1.2214 ≈ 0.819.

So P = 1 - 0.819 = 0.181, as before.

So P ≈ 0.18 or 18%, which is closest to option J (0.2), but wait, 0.18 is closer to 0.15 (option D) or 0.2 (option J). Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in not considering the correct formula? Wait, maybe I should check the formula again.

Wait, I used P = 1 - e^(-nσx). That's correct for the probability of at least one interaction, but wait, is that applicable here? Or is it the case that the cross-section is per nucleus, and when you have a small probability, P ≈ nσx?

Wait, because when nσx is small, e^(-nσx) ≈ 1 - nσx, so P≈nσx. But in our case, nσx is about 0.2, which isn't that small, so the approximation might not hold. Wait, no, the formula I used is correct for any nσx.

Wait, but let's think about the formula. The probability of no collision is e^(-nσx), so the probability of a collision is 1 - e^(-nσx). So that's correct.

But let me compute 1 - e^(-0.199) more accurately.

Let me compute e^-0.199:

We can compute using a Taylor series expansion around x=0:

e^x = 1 + x + x²/2! + x³/3! + x^4/4! + ...

So for x = -0.199, e^-0.199 ≈ 1 -0.199 + (0.199)^2/2 - (0.199)^3/6 + (0.199)^4/24.

Compute each term:

Term 1: 1

Term 2: -0.199 → sum is 0.801

Term 3: (0.199)^2 / 2 = (0.039601)/2 ≈ 0.0198005 → sum is 0.8208

Term 4: -(0.199)^3 /6 → (0.007880599)/6 ≈ 0.001313433 → subtract → 0.819487

Term 5: (0.199)^4 /24 → (0.001568) /24 ≈ 0.0000653 → add → 0.819552

So e^-0.199 ≈ 0.81955. So P = 1 - 0.81955 = 0.18045, approximately 18%.

Looking at the options, the closest is option J: 0.2, which is 20%. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of nσx.

Wait, another way: perhaps the cross-section is given per nucleus, and perhaps the formula uses the number of target nuclei per area? Or maybe I should have used the molar mass more accurately.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the formula P = 1 - exp(-Σ), where Σ = n σ x.

Wait, but I think I did that. Let me double-check the numbers.

n is 5.85e22 cm⁻³.

σ is 17e-24 cm².

x is 0.2 cm.

nσx = 5.85e22 * 17e-24 * 0.2 = let's calculate the exponents first.

5.85e22 * 17e-24 = 5.85 *17 * 1e-2 = 99.45 * 0.01 = 0.9945.

Multiply by 0.2: 0.9945 *0.2 = 0.1989.

So yes, same as before.

Then P ≈ 18%, but the options don't have 0.18. The closest is J (0.2) and F (0.05), but wait, other options: option J is 0.2 (20%), D is 0.15, which is 15%. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of n. Maybe I should check the density or molar mass again.

Silver's molar mass is about 107.87 g/mol. Let me recalculate using 107.87 instead of 108.

n = (10.5 g/cm³) * (6.022e23 atoms/mol) / (107.87 g/mol)

So 10.5 / 107.87 = let's compute that.

107.87 is approximately 107.87 ≈ 108, but more precisely, 10.5 /107.87 = 0.09735 (because 107.87 * 0.09735 ≈ 10.5).

So 0.09735 * 6.022e23 = ?

0.09735 *6.022 = let's compute.

0.09 *6.022=0.54198.

0.00735 *6.022 ≈ 0.04424.

Total ≈ 0.54198 + 0.04424 = 0.58622.

So n ≈ 0.58622e23 = 5.8622e22 cm⁻³.

Then, nσ =5.8622e22 *17e-24 = (5.8622 *17) *1e-2.

5 *17 =85, 0.8622*17≈14.6574 → 99.6574. So 99.6574e-2 → 0.996574 cm⁻¹.

Multiply by x=0.2 cm: 0.996574 *0.2 = 0.1993.

So Σ = 0.1993.

Then P = 1 - e^-0.1993 ≈ 1 - 0.8193 ≈ 0.1807, so 18.07%.

Still, the closest option is J (0.2), but that's 20%, which is a bit higher. Maybe I missed a factor somewhere.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the cross-section is given in barns per nucleus, and the number of nuclei is per cm³. Did I account for that correctly? I think so.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate using more precise exponentials.

Let me compute e^-0.1993 more accurately.

Using a calculator (but I don't have one here), but I can remember that e^-0.2 is approximately 0.8187.

So e^-0.1993 ≈ 0.8187 + (0.2 -0.1993)* [derivative of e^-x at x=0.2].

The derivative of e^-x is -e^-x. At x=0.2, it's -e^-0.2 ≈ -0.8187.

The difference in x is 0.2 -0.1993 = 0.0007.

So the change in e^-x is approximately (0.0007) * (-0.8187) → -0.000572.

So e^-0.1993 ≈ e^-0.2 - 0.000572 = 0.8187 - 0.000572 ≈ 0.8181.

Wait, but that can't be right because lower x (from 0.2 to 0.1993) would mean higher e^-x, because x is negative.

Wait, no, at x=0.1993, which is less than 0.2, so e^-0.1993 is greater than e^-0.2.

Wait, let me think again. Let x = 0.2, and we're looking at x' = 0.1993, which is 0.0007 less than 0.2.

So the change in x is Δx = -0.0007.

Using the expansion e^(x + Δx) ≈ e^x + e^x Δx.

But here, I'm considering e^(x - 0.0007) = e^x * e^(-0.0007) ≈ e^x (1 - 0.0007).

So e^-0.1993 = e^-(0.2 - 0.0007) = e^-0.2 * e^0.0007 ≈ 0.8187 * (1 + 0.0007) ≈ 0.8187 + 0.8187*0.0007 ≈ 0.8187 + 0.000573 ≈ 0.81927.

So P =1 - 0.81927 ≈ 0.1807, which is about 18.07%.

But the options are A:0.9, B:0.3, C:0.1, D:0.15, E:0.5, F:0.05, G:0.7, H:0.8, I:0.6, J:0.2.

So 0.18 is closest to 0.2 (option J), but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the formula uses the mass thickness (in grams per square centimeter) instead of nσx.

Wait, mass thickness would be (density * thickness), in g/cm².

Then, the formula for probability could be P = 1 - exp(- (σ * N_A * thickness * density) / (M) )

Wait, let me think: the number of target nuclei per area is n * x, where n is number per volume, and x is thickness. So n * x = (ρ N_A / M) * x.

So, Σ (the macroscopic cross-section) is σ * n = σ * (ρ N_A / M).

Then Σ * x = σ * (ρ N_A / M) * x.

So yes, the same as before.

So, perhaps it's correct, but let me compute the exact value of nσx again:

n = (ρ N_A ) / M = (10.5 g/cm³ * 6.022e23 /mol) / (107.87 g/mol) 

Compute 10.5 /107.87 = approx 0.09735.

0.09735 *6.022e23 = 5.86e22 cm⁻³.

σ =17e-24 cm².

x=0.2 cm.

So nσx =5.86e22 *17e-24 *0.2 = (5.86 *17 *0.2 ) *1e-2.

5.86 *17 = 99.62, 99.62 *0.2 =19.924, 19.924e-2 = 0.19924.

So same as before.

Hmm, maybe the cross-section is given in cm², but perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion.

Wait, 1 barn is 1e-24 cm², correct. So 17 barns is 17e-24 cm². So that's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula uses the natural logarithm, but no, the formula is exponential.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the approximation for small nσx, where P ≈ nσx. Then 0.199, which is 19.9%, so closest to 0.2 (option J). But the actual calculation gives 18%, which is closer to 0.18, but that's not an option.

Wait, looking back at the options, J is 0.2, which is 20%, the closest to 18.07%.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Maybe the cross-section is per mole, but I don't think so. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is supposed to ignore the exponential and just compute P = nσx? But that would be 0.199, so 0.2 (option J). But that's an approximation valid when P is small, but 0.2 isn't that small, so the actual probability would be a bit less.

Wait
