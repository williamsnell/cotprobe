Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about.

The question is about preparing silver bromide (AgBr) used in photography. They give me the reactants as silver nitrate (AgNO3) and sodium bromide (NaBr). I need to find out how much of each I need to produce 93.3 pounds of AgBr. And there are multiple-choice options to choose from.

Alright, first, I think I should write down the chemical equation for this reaction. Silver nitrate and sodium bromide reacting will form silver bromide and sodium nitrate. So the equation should be:

AgNO3 + NaBr → AgBr + NaNO3

I remember that this is a double displacement reaction. Both compounds swap their ions. Silver from AgNO3 pairs with bromide from NaBr to make AgBr, and sodium from NaBr pairs with nitrate from AgNO3 to make NaNO3.

Now, next step is to balance the equation. Let me check the coefficients. On the left, we have one AgNO3 and one NaBr. On the right, one AgBr and one NaNO3. So, the equation is already balanced as is. The coefficients are all 1, so the mole ratio is 1:1 for AgNO3 to NaBr to AgBr.

Wait, but I need to make sure about the stoichiometry. So for each mole of AgNO3, one mole of AgBr is produced. Same for NaBr. So the molar ratio is 1:1:1:1. So yes, balanced.

Now, the problem gives me the desired mass of AgBr as 93.3 pounds. I need to convert that into grams because the molar masses are usually in grams per mole. Oh wait, the question mentions that 1 lb is 454 grams. So 93.3 lb * 454 g/lb. Let me calculate that.

93.3 * 454. Let me break that down. 90 * 454 = 40,860? Wait, 90*454 is 90*400=36,000 and 90*54=4,860, so total 40,860. Then 3.3*454 is let's see: 3*454=1362, 0.3*454=136.2, so 1362 + 136.2 = 1498.2. So total is 40,860 + 1,498.2 = 42,358.2 grams of AgBr.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 93.3 lb *454 g/lb. 93.3 *454.

Alternatively, 93.3 * 454 = let's compute that step by step.

93 * 454 would be 93 * 400 = 37,200 and 93 *54= 5,022. So 37,200 + 5,022 = 42,222 grams. Then 0.3 lb is 0.3 *454=136.2 grams. So total 42,222 + 136.2 = 42,358.2 grams. Yep, same as before.

So molar mass of AgBr. Let me calculate that. Silver (Ag) has an atomic weight of about 107.87 g/mol. Bromine (Br) is about 79.90 g/mol. So AgBr is 107.87 +79.90 = 187.77 g/mol.

So moles of AgBr needed is mass divided by molar mass. So 42,358.2 g / 187.77 g/mol.

Let me compute that. 42358.2 / 187.77. Let me approximate. 187.77 times 225 is 42,249.75 (because 200*187.77=37,554; 25*187.77=4,694.25; total 37,554 +4,694.25 =42,248.25. Hmm, wait, 225 * 187.77 = (200 * 187.77) + (25 *187.77) = 37,554 + 4,694.25 = 42,248.25. So 225 moles would give 42,248.25 grams. But we have 42,358.2 grams, which is about 110 more grams. So 225 + (110 /187.77) ≈ 225 + 0.586 ≈ 225.586 moles of AgBr.

But wait, perhaps I should do it more accurately. Let's compute 42358.2 ÷ 187.77.

Well, 187.77 * 225 = 42,248.25 as before. The difference is 42358.2 -42,248.25 = 109.95 grams. 109.95 /187.77 ≈ 0.586 moles. So total moles ≈ 225.586.

But wait, maybe I can just use a calculator approach.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to note that since the molar ratio is 1:1, the moles of AgNO3 and NaBr needed each equal the moles of AgBr produced.

So moles of AgBr = 42,358.2 g /187.77 g/mol ≈ let me calculate that.

42,358.2 ÷187.77 ≈ let's see: 187.77 * 225 = 42,248.25. Subtract that from 42,358.2 gives 109.95. 109.95 /187.77 ≈ 0.586. So 225.586 moles.

So each of AgNO3 and NaBr is needed in 225.586 moles.

Now, I need to find the mass of each of these reactants.

First, molar masses:

AgNO3: Ag is 107.87, N is 14.01, O is 16.00 *3 =48. So total is 107.87 +14.01 +48 = 169.88 g/mol.

NaBr: Na is about 22.99, Br is 79.90, so 22.99 +79.90 = 102.89 g/mol.

So for AgNO3: moles = 225.586, so mass is 225.586 * 169.88 g.

Let me compute that. 225 * 170 is 38,250. But exact calculation:

225.586 * 169.88.

Let me break it down.

First, 200 * 169.88 =33,976 g.

25.586 * 169.88. Hmm.

Compute 25 *169.88 =4,247. Then 0.586 *169.88 ≈ (0.5 *169.88)=84.94, (0.08 *169.88)=13.59, (0.006*169.88)=1.019. So 84.94 +13.59=98.53 +1.019≈99.55. So total is 4,247 +99.55≈4,346.55.

So total AgNO3 mass is 33,976 +4,346.55 =38,322.55 grams.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 225.586 is 225 + 0.586. So 225 *169.88 = (200 *169.88) + (25 *169.88) = 33,976 +4,247=38,223 grams. Then 0.586 *169.88 is approximately 0.586 *170=≈99.62. So total AgNO3 is 38,223 +99.62≈38,322.62 grams.

Now, convert that to pounds. Since 1 lb is 454 grams, so 38,322.62 g divided by 454 g/lb.

38,322.62 ÷454 ≈ let me compute.

Well, 454 *84 = let's see, 400*84=33,600; 54*84=4,536, so total 33,600+4,536=38,136. So 84 lbs is 38,136 grams. The remainder is 38,322.62 -38,136=186.62 grams. So 186.62 /454 ≈0.411 lbs. So total is approximately 84.411 lbs of AgNO3.

Wait, but let me check 38,322.62 / 454:

454 * 84 = 38,136.

38,322.62 -38,136 = 186.62.

186.62 /454 = approximately 0.411.

So total AgNO3 needed is about 84.411 pounds.

Now, for NaBr: moles again are 225.586, so mass is 225.586 *102.89 g/mol.

Compute 225 *102.89 = ?

200*102.89=20,578 grams.

25 *102.89=2,572.25 grams.

Total 20,578 +2,572.25=23,150.25 grams.

Then 0.586 *102.89 ≈0.586*(100) =58.6, 0.586*(2.89)=≈1.69. So about 58.6+1.69=60.29 grams.

So total NaBr mass is 23,150.25 +60.29≈23,210.54 grams.

Convert to pounds: 23,210.54 g /454 g/lb.

Compute how many lbs that is.

Well, 454 *51 = 454*50=22,700, and 454*1=454. So 22,700+454=23,154.

So 51 lbs is 23,154 grams.

We have 23,210.54 grams.

23,210.54 -23,154=56.54 grams left.

56.54 /454 ≈0.1245 lbs.

So total NaBr is approximately 51.1245 lbs.

Wait, but wait, let me calculate more accurately.

23,210.54 /454.

454 *51 =23,154.

23,210.54 -23,154=56.54.

56.54 /454 = 0.1245 lbs.

So 51.1245 lbs.

Wait, but let me think. Perhaps I made a mistake in calculation earlier because the options don't have 51 and 84. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option C: 52.7 NaBr and 84.7 AgNO3.

Option H: 58 NaBr and 78 AgNO3.

Option J:55 NaBr and 80 AgNO3.

Wait, my calculations gave me NaBr as about 51.12 lbs and AgNO3 as 84.41 lbs.

Looking at the options, option C is 52.7 and 84.7. That's very close to my calculations. Hmm. So perhaps I should check my computations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the molar masses or the initial calculations.

Let me double-check the molar masses.

AgBr: Ag is 107.87, Br is 79.90. So 107.87 +79.90=187.77 g/mol. Correct.

AgNO3: Ag (107.87) + N (14.01) + 3 O (16*3=48) →107.87 +14.01=121.88 +48=169.88 g/mol. Correct.

NaBr: Na (22.99) + Br (79.90)=102.89 g/mol. Correct.

Moles of AgBr: 42358.2 g /187.77 g/mol = approximately 225.586 moles. Correct.

Mass of AgNO3: 225.586 * 169.88 = let's compute this more accurately.

225 *169.88 = ?

200*169.88=33,976.

25*169.88=4,247.

So 225 *169.88=38,223.

0.586 *169.88 = let's compute exactly.

0.5 *169.88 =84.94.

0.08 *169.88=13.5904.

0.006 *169.88=1.01928.

So total 84.94 +13.5904=98.5304 +1.01928=99.54968.

So 0.586 *169.88=99.54968.

Thus, 225.586 *169.88=38,223 +99.54968=38,322.54968 grams.

Convert to lbs: 38,322.54968 /454 ≈ let me compute again.

454 *84=38,136.

38,322.54968-38,136=186.54968 grams.

186.54968 /454 = approximately 0.4107 lbs.

So total AgNO3 is 84.4107 lbs, which is approximately 84.41 lbs.

Similarly, NaBr: 225.586 *102.89 =?

I'll compute 225 *102.89 first.

225 *100=22,500.

225 *2.89= let's compute 200*2.89=578, 25*2.89=72.25. So 578+72.25=650.25.

So 225 *102.89=22,500 + 650.25=23,150.25 grams.

0.586 *102.89= let's calculate.

0.5 *102.89=51.445.

0.08 *102.89=8.2312.

0.006 *102.89=0.61734.

Add them: 51.445 +8.2312=59.6762 +0.61734=60.29354 grams.

So total NaBr is 23,150.25 +60.29354=23,210.543 grams.

Convert to lbs: 23,210.543 /454 ≈ let's compute.

454 *51=23,154.

23,210.543 -23,154=56.543 grams.

56.543 /454= approx 0.1245 lbs.

So NaBr is 51.1245 lbs.

So AgNO3 is approx 84.41 lbs, NaBr is approx 51.12 lbs.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C: 52.7 lbs NaBr and 84.7 lbs AgNO3.

Wait, but my NaBr was 51.12 and AgNO3 84.41. So option C is 52.7 and 84.7, which is a bit higher than my calculation.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles of AgBr. Let me recompute moles.

AgBr mass is 93.3 lb = 93.3 *454 g. Let me compute that accurately.

93 *454:

Compute 90*454=40,860.

3*454=1,362.

So 40,860 +1,362=42,222 grams.

0.3 lb is 0.3*454=136.2 grams.

So total AgBr is 42,222 +136.2=42,358.2 grams.

Molar mass AgBr=187.77 g/mol.

Moles AgBr=42,358.2 /187.77.

Let me compute this division accurately.

187.77 *225 = 42,248.25. 

42,358.2 -42,248.25=109.95 g.

109.95 /187.77 ≈0.586.

So moles=225.586.

Yes, correct.

Hmm, perhaps the options are using more precise atomic weights. Let me try using more accurate atomic masses.

Silver (Ag): atomic weight 107.8682 g/mol.

Bromine (Br): 79.904 g/mol.

So AgBr=107.8682 +79.904=187.7722 g/mol.

AgNO3: Ag=107.8682, N=14.0067, O=15.999*3=47.997.

So 107.8682 +14.0067=121.8749 +47.997=169.8719 g/mol.

NaBr: Na=22.9898, Br=79.904 →102.8938 g/mol.

Let me recompute using these precise values.

Moles AgBr=42,358.2 /187.7722 → let me compute that.

42,358.2 ÷187.7722.

Let me see: 187.7722 * 225 = ?

187.7722 *200=37,554.44.

187.7722 *25=4,694.305.

Total 37,554.44 +4,694.305=42,248.745.

So 225 moles →42,248.745 grams.

Subtract from 42,358.2 →42,358.2 -42,248.745=109.455 grams.

Now, 109.455 /187.7722 ≈ 0.5828 moles.

So total moles=225.5828 ≈225.583.

So now, compute AgNO3 mass: 225.583 * 169.8719.

Let me compute 225 *169.8719 =38,223. approximately.

Wait, 225 *170=38,250. But 169.8719 is less than 170.

So 225 *169.8719 = 225*(170 - 0.1281) = 38,250 - (225 *0.1281).

225 *0.1281=28.7225.

So 38,250 -28.7225=38,221.2775.

Then 0.583 *169.8719 ≈0.5*169.8719=84.93595, 0.08*169.8719=13.58975, 0.003*169.8719=0.5096157. Adding: 84.93595 +13.58975=98.5257 +0.5096≈99.0353.

So total AgNO3 mass=38,221.2775 +99.0353≈38,320.3128 grams.

Convert to pounds: 38,320.3128 /454.

38,136 grams is 84 lbs (since 454*84=38,136).

So 38,320.3128 -38,136=184.3128 grams.

184.3128 /454≈0.4059 lbs.

So AgNO3 is 84.4059 lbs, approximately 84.406 lbs.

NaBr: 225.583 moles *102.8938 g/mol.

225 *102.8938=23,151.33 grams.

0.583 *102.8938≈0.5*102.8938=51.4469, 0.08*102.8938=8.2315, 0.003*102.8938=0.3087. Total≈51.4469+8.2315=
