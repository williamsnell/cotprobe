Okay, so I've got this problem about an isothermal compression of a perfect gas. Hmm, isothermal means the temperature stays constant, right? So I remember that for isothermal processes, the ideal gas law can be simplified to Boyle's Law. Oh wait, Boyle's Law is P1 * V1 = P2 * V2. Right, because temperature is constant, so the product of pressure and volume remains the same.

The problem says the gas undergoes isothermal compression, which reduces its volume by 2.20 dm³. So the initial volume minus 2.20 dm³ equals the final volume. Wait, let me check the numbers. The final volume is given as 4.65 dm³. So the initial volume V1 would be 4.65 + 2.20. Let me calculate that. 4.65 plus 2.20 is 6.85 dm³. Got it.

The final pressure P2 is 5.04 bar. I need to find the initial pressure P1. Using Boyle's Law: P1 * V1 = P2 * V2. Wait no, wait—wait, I should get the variables straight. V1 is initial volume, V2 is final volume. So the equation is P1 * V1 = P2 * V2. So we have P1 = (P2 * V2) / V1.

Wait no, wait again. Because during compression, the volume decreases. So V2 is the final volume, which is smaller than V1. So V2 is 4.65, and V1 is 6.85. So substituting into the equation: P1 = (P2 * V2) / V1. Wait no, wait, no, wait: Wait, let me think again. Boyle's Law states P1V1 = P2V2. So solving for P1: P1 = (P2 * V2) / V1. Right, because P1 = (P2 * V2) / V1.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure about the formula. So initial state: P1, V1. Final state: P2, V2. So if the volume decreases, the pressure increases because it's compression. So yes, P1 should be less than P2 if the volume decreases. Wait wait, no. Wait, when you compress the gas, the volume decreases, so pressure increases. So if V2 is smaller than V1, then P2 is larger than P1. Because if you go from V1 to a smaller V2, pressure goes up. So P2 is higher than P1.

Wait, but in the problem, the final pressure is 5.04 bar. So if the compression leads to higher pressure, then the initial pressure must have been lower. So P1 is less than P2.

So now, plug the numbers in. V1 is 6.85 dm³, V2 is 4.65 dm³, and P2 is 5.04 bar.

So P1 = (P2 * V2) / V1. Let me compute that.

First, calculate the numerator: 5.04 bar * 4.65 dm³. Let me do the multiplication. 5 times 4.65 is 23.25, but wait, 5.04 is 5 + 0.04. So 5*4.65 is 23.25, 0.04*4.65 is 0.186. So total is 23.25 + 0.186 = 23.436.

Then, divide by V1, which is 6.85 dm³. So 23.436 / 6.85.

Let me compute that. Let's see, 6.85 times 3 is 20.55. 23.436 minus 20.55 is 2.886. So 3 and 2.886/6.85. Hmm. 6.85 goes into 2.886 how many times? Let me compute:

6.85 * 0.42 = let's see, 6 * 0.42 is 2.52, 0.85 * 0.42 = 0.357, so total 2.52 + 0.357 = 2.877. So 0.42 *6.85=2.877, which is close to 2.886. So 3.42 approximately.

Wait, 3.42 times 6.85 should be 23.407? Let me check 3 *6.85=20.55, 0.42 *6.85 is 2.877, so total 23.427. The numerator is 23.436, so the result is approximately 3.42 + (23.436 -23.427)/6.85.

Wait, 23.436 minus 23.427 is 0.009. So 0.009 divided by 6.85 is about 0.0013. So P1 is approximately 3.4213 bar.

Looking at the options, option D is 3.42 bar. So the answer should be D.

Wait, let me double-check my calculation because sometimes I make mistakes. So P2 is 5.04, V2 is 4.65, V1 is 6.85.

Compute P1 = (5.04 *4.65)/6.85.

I'll compute 5.04 *4.65 first. Breaking it down:

5 *4.65 = 23.25
0.04 *4.65 = 0.186
Total =23.436.

Divide by 6.85.

Wait, perhaps an alternative way: 6.85 *3.42 = ?

6.85 *3 =20.55

6.85 *0.4 =2.74

6.85 *0.02=0.137

So adding 20.55 +2.74=23.29, plus 0.137=23.427, which is very close to 23.436.

So 6.85 *3.42 =23.427.

So 23.436 /6.85 is 3.42 plus (0.009/6.85) which is ~0.00131.

So approximately 3.4213 bar.

Looking back at the options, option D is 3.42 bar. So that's the correct answer.

To solve the problem, we use Boyle's Law, which states that for an isothermal process, the product of pressure and volume remains constant:  

\[
P_1 V_1 = P_2 V_2
\]

Here, the initial pressure \(P_1\) is unknown, while the final pressure \(P_2 = 5.04 \, \mathrm{bar}\), the final volume \(V_2 = 4.65 \, \mathrm{dm}^3\), and the initial volume \(V_1 = V_2 + 2.20 \, \mathrm{dm}^3 = 4.65 + 2.20 = 6.85 \, \mathrm{dm}^3\). Rearranging Boyle's Law to solve for \(P_1\):

\[
P_1 = \frac{P_2 V_2}{V_1}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
P_1 = \frac{5.04 \cdot 4.65}{6.85}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
5.04 \cdot 4.65 = 23.436
\]

Then divide by \(6.85\):

\[
P_1 = \frac{23.436}{6.85} \approx 3.42 \, \mathrm{bar}
\]

Thus, the initial pressure of the gas is approximately \(3.42 \, \mathrm{bar}\). Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

**D: 3.42 bar**
