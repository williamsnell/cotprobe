Okay, so I've got this problem here about Daniel's commission and I need to find out his sales. Hmm, let's see. The problem says Daniel receives a 6.5% commission on all his sales. He got a commission of $275.08, and I need to find out what his total sales were.

Alright, commission is like a percentage of the sales he made. So, if I remember correctly, commission is calculated by multiplying the total sales by the commission rate. So the formula should be something like Commission = Sales × Rate.

Wait, right, so the formula is Commission = Sales × (Commission Rate), which is in decimal form. So the rate here is 6.5%, which I need to convert to a decimal. To do that, I divide by 100. So 6.5 divided by 100 is 0.065.

So the equation becomes $275.08 = Sales × 0.065. I need to solve for Sales. To get Sales, I should divide both sides of the equation by 0.065.

Let me write that down. Sales = 275.08 / 0.065. Now I need to calculate that. Hmm, I'm not too confident about doing this in my head, so maybe I can approximate it or use a calculator if I had one, but since I'm just thinking, let's try to break it down.

Wait, 0.065 is the same as 6.5%, which is 65 per 1000. So maybe I can think of it as 65/1000. So Sales = 275.08 * (1000/65). Let me compute that.

First, let's see what 275.08 divided by 65 is. Let me do that division. 65 times 4 is 260, and 275.08 minus 260 is 15.08. So 15.08 divided by 65 is approximately 0.232. So 4.232. Then, I multiply that by 1000 to get the Sales. So 4.232 times 1000 is 4232.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me check that again. Because when I do 65 × 4.232, does that equal 275? Let me see: 4 ×65 is 260, 0.232×65 is about 15, so 260+15=275. Yep, that makes sense.

But wait, the options given are in whole numbers, like $3200, $4750, etc. So 4232 is approximately 4230, which is one of the options. Let me look at the options again.

Looking back, option F is $4230. So that's probably the right answer. But wait, I should make sure I didn't make a calculation error.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it as 0.065 times Sales equals 275.08. So Sales = 275.08 / 0.065. Let me compute this division.

Alternatively, I can think of it as moving the decimal. 275.08 divided by 0.065. Since 0.065 has three decimal places, I can multiply numerator and denominator by 1000 to eliminate decimals. So that becomes 275080 divided by 65.

Now, let's compute 275080 ÷ 65. Hmm, 65 × 4000 is 260,000. Subtracting that from 275,080 gives 15,080. Now, 65 × 232 is 15,080 because 65 × 200 is 13,000 and 65 ×32 is 2,080. So 200+32=232. So total is 4000+232=4232.

So Sales are $4,232. Looking at the options, the closest is F: $4230. So I think F is the correct answer.

To determine Daniel's sales, we use the commission formula:

\[
\text{Commission} = \text{Sales} \times \text{Commission Rate}
\]

Given that the commission is $275.08 and the commission rate is 6.5% (or 0.065 in decimal form), we can rearrange the formula to solve for Sales:

\[
\text{Sales} = \frac{\text{Commission}}{\text{Commission Rate}} = \frac{275.08}{0.065}
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\text{Sales} = 4,232
\]

Among the provided options, the closest value is **$4,230**, which corresponds to option **F**.
