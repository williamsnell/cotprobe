Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about the human appendix and whether it's a completely vestigial organ. I remember that a vestigial organ is one that has lost its original function through evolution. So the question is asking which statement would most go against the idea that the appendix is vestigial.

Looking at the options, I'll go through each one and see which one challenges the notion that the appendix is completely vestigial.

Option A says the size varies among individuals. Hmm, I'm not sure how size variation directly affects vestigial status. Vestigial organs might be smaller, but size alone might not mean much. Maybe it's just a variation without function.

Option B claims individuals with larger appendixes have fewer offspring. If a larger appendix is correlated with lower reproductive success, that might suggest it's not beneficial, so maybe supports vestigiality. But I'm not sure how this directly impacts the claim. It could be a neutral trait.

Option C mentions location near the large intestine. Well, that's just anatomical position, but I don't see how that directly supports or detracts from it being vestigial. Vestigial organs can be in various places.

Option D states the appendix isn't present in all mammals. Oh, that makes sense because vestigial structures may have been lost in some species. If some mammals don't have it, it suggests it's not essential, supporting vestigial status. So this might not be the answer we're looking for.

Option E says the appendix can be removed without ill effects. That's a classic argument for it being vestigial because if you can remove it without issues, it's not doing much. So this supports the vestigial claim, not detracting from it.

Option F suggests the appendix was larger in fossils. That's actually supporting the vestigial idea because it implies it had a function in the past but has since reduced, making it vestigial. So this wouldn't be the answer.

Option G says the appendix has a lot of defensive lymphatic tissue. Wait, if it has a substantial amount of lymphatic tissue, that implies it has a function in the immune system. That would mean it's not completely vestigial because it contributes to the body's defense. So this would be a statement that detracts from the claim that it's vestigial.

Option H is about inflammation in appendicitis. Well, that's a condition where the appendix is problematic, but that's more about it causing issues rather than its normal function. It doesn't directly say it has a useful function now.

Option I states many people live healthily without it. This supports the vestigial idea because they can remove it without issues. So this supports the claim, not the opposite.

Option J claims the appendix has no known function in digestion. That's a key point for vestigiality. If it doesn't help in digestion, which is a major system, then it's considered non-functional. So this supports the claim, not the opposite.

So the key point is which option shows the appendix has some function now. Option G points out that it has a substantial amount of defensive lymphatic tissue, implying it plays a role in the immune system. That would mean it's not completely vestigial because it still serves a purpose, even if it's not related to digestion.

The statement that most detracts from the claim that the human appendix is a completely vestigial organ is **G: The appendix has a substantial amount of defensive lymphatic tissue**. This is because the presence of significant lymphatic tissue suggests that the appendix has a functional role in the immune system, which contradicts the idea that it is entirely non-functional and vestigial.

Answer: G
