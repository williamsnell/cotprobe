Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about a particle in an electric field. Alright, I remember that when a charge moves through an electric field, it experiences a force. 

The problem states that a particle with mass m and charge Q is moving with velocity V towards a uniform electric field E, and it travels a distance d. Then, the question is asking how far the particle travels when the original velocity is doubled and the mass is halved. So the new velocity is 2V, and the new mass is m/2.

Wait, I think I remember that the distance a charged particle travels in an electric field before stopping (or something like that) depends on its initial kinetic energy and the work done by the electric field. Oh right, the electric force does work on the charge, which affects its motion.

Let me think about the forces involved. The electric force on the charge is F = Q * E. Since the charge is moving into the field, the force would be opposite to the direction of motion, causing deceleration. So the particle will slow down and eventually stop if it's moving against the field, right?

Wait, no. Actually, whether it stops depends on whether the electric force is opposite to the velocity. Oh yeah, because the particle is directed toward the field, the force might be in the opposite direction, causing it to decelerate.

So the work done by the electric field would change the kinetic energy of the particle. The work-energy theorem says that the work done is equal to the change in kinetic energy. So initially, the particle has kinetic energy (1/2)mv². The electric field does work on it, which will reduce this kinetic energy to zero at the stopping point.

Wait, but if the particle is moving into a region with an electric field, the force could either accelerate or decelerate it depending on the charge's sign. But the problem doesn't specify the direction, so I guess we just consider the magnitude here.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Find the work done by the electric field as the particle moves distance d.
2. Set that equal to the change in kinetic energy.
3. Solve for d in terms of the initial variables.
4. Then, adjust the variables (double V, half mass) and find the new distance.

But wait, the setup is that the particle travels a distance d when moving with velocity V and mass m. So first, I need to find d in terms of m, V, Q, and E. Then, find the new distance when m becomes m/2 and V becomes 2V.

So let's model the situation. The electric force is F = Q * E. Since the particle is moving in the direction of the field or opposite? Well, let's assume the field exerts a force opposite to the direction of motion, causing deceleration. So the particle slows down as it moves through the field.

Wait, but the problem says the particle is "directed toward" the electric field. Hmm. So maybe the particle is moving into a region where the electric field is pointing in the opposite direction, so the force is opposite to the velocity. That makes sense.

So the work done by the electric field is W = F * d * cos(theta), where theta is the angle between the force and displacement. Since the force is opposite to the displacement, theta is 180 degrees, cos(theta) is -1. So W = -F * d.

But the work done by the electric field is also equal to the change in kinetic energy. Initially, the particle has kinetic energy (1/2) m V². After moving distance d, it stops, so final KE is zero. So the change in KE is - (1/2) m V².

Wait, but the work done by the field is W = ΔKE. So,

W = KE_final - KE_initial = 0 - (1/2 m V²) = - (1/2 m V²).

But also, W = - F d = - (Q E) d.

Setting these equal:

- Q E d = - (1/2 m V²)

The negatives cancel out:

Q E d = (1/2 m V² )

So solving for d:

d = ( (1/2) m V² ) / (Q E )

Hmm, but wait, that's for the initial case. Now, in the modified case, the velocity is doubled, and the mass is halved.

So the new mass is m' = m/2, the new velocity is V' = 2 V.

Plugging into the same formula, the new distance d' would be:

d' = [ (1/2) * m' * (V')² ] / (Q E )

Substituting m' = m/2 and V' = 2 V:

d' = [ (1/2) * (m/2) * (2 V)^2 ] / (Q E )

Let me compute the numerator:

(1/2) * (m/2) = m/4.

(2 V)^2 = 4 V².

Multiply them together: (m/4) * 4 V² = m V².

So numerator is m V².

Denominator is Q E.

So d' = (m V²) / (Q E )

Wait, but in the original case, d was (1/2 m V²)/(Q E) ) = (m V²)/(2 Q E).

So d' = (m V²)/(Q E) = 2 * [ (m V²) / (2 Q E) ) ] = 2 d.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Original d: (1/2 m V²) / (Q E) = (m V²)/(2 Q E).

New scenario:

d' = [ (1/2) * (m/2) * (4 V²) ) ] / (Q E )

So (1/2) * (m/2) = m/4.

4 V² comes from (2V)^2.

So m/4 * 4 V² = m V².

So d' = (m V²) / (Q E) = 2 * [ (m V²) / (2 Q E) ) ] = 2d.

Wait, that can't be right because substituting the numbers gives d' = 2d.

So the distance would be twice as much as before.

Looking at the options, option G is 2d. So the answer should be G.

But wait, wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Because in the new case, the mass is halved and velocity doubled.

Alternatively, maybe the initial equation is different. Let me think again.

The equation I used was Q E d = (1/2) m V².

Wait, but wait. The work done by the electric field is W = F * d * cos(theta), and F is Q E. Since the force is opposite to displacement, cos(180) is -1, so W = - Q E d.

The change in kinetic energy is (0 - (1/2 m V²)) = - (1/2 m V²).

So, W = ΔKE => - Q E d = - (1/2 m V² )

Which simplifies to Q E d = (1/2 m V² )

So d = ( (1/2 m V² ) ) / (Q E )

So that's correct.

Now, when velocity is doubled (2V) and mass is halved (m/2), the new d' is:

d' = ( (1/2) * (m/2) * (2V)^2 ) / (Q E )

Compute numerator:

(1/2) * (m/2) = m/4.

(2V)^2 = 4 V².

Multiply m/4 *4 V² = m V².

So numerator is m V².

Denominator same: Q E.

So d' = (m V²) / (Q E ) = 2 * [ (1/2 m V^2) / (Q E) ) ] * 2? Wait, no.

Wait, the original d is (1/2 m V²) / (Q E) = (m V²)/(2 Q E )

So d' is (m V²)/(Q E) = 2*(d) because d was (m V²)/(2 Q E ), so 2 times that is (m V²)/(Q E ), which is exactly d'.

So yes, d' is twice the original distance.

So the answer should be G: 2d.

To determine how far the particle travels when its velocity is doubled and its mass is halved, we analyze the situation using the work-energy theorem. The electric force acting on the charge is \( F = QE \), and the work done by this force as the particle moves a distance \( d \) is \( W = -F \cdot d = -QE \cdot d \). This work changes the particle's kinetic energy, and according to the work-energy theorem:

\[
W = \Delta KE
\]

Initially, the particle's kinetic energy is \( KE_{\text{initial}} = \frac{1}{2} m V^2 \), and after traveling distance \( d \), the particle comes to rest, so \( KE_{\text{final}} = 0 \). Thus:

\[
-QE \cdot d = 0 - \frac{1}{2} m V^2
\]

Simplifying:

\[
d = \frac{\frac{1}{2} m V^2}{QE}
\]

Now, in the modified scenario, the velocity is doubled (\( V' = 2V \)) and the mass is halved (\( m' = \frac{m}{2} \)). Substituting these values into the formula for \( d' \):

\[
d' = \frac{\frac{1}{2} m' V'^2}{QE}
\]

\[
d' = \frac{\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{m}{2} \cdot (2V)^2}{QE}
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{m}{2} = \frac{m}{4}, \quad (2V)^2 = 4V^2
\]

\[
\frac{m}{4} \cdot 4V^2 = mV^2
\]

Thus:

\[
d' = \frac{mV^2}{QE}
\]

Comparing this to the original distance \( d = \frac{\frac{1}{2} m V^2}{QE} = \frac{mV^2}{2QE} \), we find:

\[
d' = 2d
\]

Therefore, the particle travels twice the original distance when the velocity is doubled and the mass is halved. The correct answer is:

**G: 2d**
