Okay, so I have this question about the Federal Reserve and money supply. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which option lists only Fed actions that will increase the money supply. The options are A to H. I remember that the Fed has three main tools: reserve requirements, discount rate, and open market operations.

Let me recall how each tool affects the money supply. Lowering reserve requirements means banks have to hold less in reserves, so they can lend more. That should increase the money supply because more loans mean more money in circulation. Raising reserve requirements would do the opposite, reducing the money supply.

Next, the discount rate. If the Fed lowers the discount rate, it's cheaper for banks to borrow money. So banks are more likely to borrow, which increases their reserves and thus their ability to lend. More lending increases the money supply. If the discount rate is raised, borrowing becomes more expensive, so banks borrow less, leading to less lending and a decrease in money supply.

Then there's open market operations. When the Fed buys bonds, they're injecting money into the economy. Banks sell bonds to the Fed, so the banks get more reserves. With more reserves, they can make more loans, increasing the money supply. If the Fed sells bonds, they're taking money out of the economy. Banks have to pay the Fed, so their reserves decrease, leading to less lending and a decrease in money supply.

Now, I need to look at each option and see which actions would all lead to an increase in the money supply.

Option A: Lower reserve requirements, lower discount rate, buy bonds. All three actions seem to increase money supply. Lowering reserve requirements frees up bank funds, lower discount rate encourages borrowing, and buying bonds injects more money. So A looks good.

Option B: Lower reserve requirements (good), lower discount rate (good), sell bonds (bad). Selling bonds decreases money supply, so B isn't all increasing.

Option C: Raise reserve requirements (bad), lowers discount (good), buys bonds (good). Since one is bad, not all right.

Option D: Both raising, which is bad, and sell bonds. Definitely not.

Option E: Lower reserve (good), raise discount rate (bad), buy bonds (good). So two goods and a bad, so no.

Option F: Lower reserve (good), raise discount (bad), sell bonds (bad). Only one good, so no.

Option G: Raise reserve (bad), raise discount (bad), buy bonds (good). Only one good, so no.

Option H: Raise reserve (bad), lower discount (good), sell bonds (bad). Again, only one good.

So the only option where all three actions lead to increasing the money supply is option A.

To determine which list contains only Federal Reserve actions that increase the money supply, we analyze the effects of each tool the Fed uses:

1. **Reserve Requirements**: Lowering reserve requirements frees up more funds for banks to lend, increasing the money supply. Raising reserve requirements reduces lending and decreases the money supply.
2. **Discount Rate**: Lowering the discount rate makes borrowing cheaper for banks, encouraging them to borrow more, which increases their ability to lend and expands the money supply. Raising the discount rate has the opposite effect.
3. **Open Market Operations**: Buying bonds injects money into the economy, increasing the money supply. Selling bonds removes money from the economy, decreasing the money supply.

Now, evaluating each option:

- **Option A**: Lower reserve requirements (increases money supply), lower discount rate (increases money supply), buy bonds (increases money supply). All actions increase the money supply.
- **Option B**: Lower reserve requirements (good), lower discount rate (good), sell bonds (bad). Not all actions increase the money supply.
- **Option C**: Raise reserve requirements (bad), lower discount rate (good), buy bonds (good). Not all actions increase the money supply.
- **Option D**: Raise reserve requirements (bad), raise discount rate (bad), sell bonds (bad). No actions increase the money supply.
- **Option E**: Lower reserve requirements (good), raise discount rate (bad), buy bonds (good). Not all actions increase the money supply.
- **Option F**: Lower reserve requirements (good), raise discount rate (bad), sell bonds (bad). Only one action increases the money supply.
- **Option G**: Raise reserve requirements (bad), raise discount rate (bad), buy bonds (good). Only one action increases the money supply.
- **Option H**: Raise reserve requirements (bad), lower discount rate (good), sell bonds (bad). Only one action increases the money supply.

The only option where all three actions increase the money supply is **Option A**.

Answer: A
