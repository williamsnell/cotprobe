Okay, so I've got this question about reinforcement schedules and their resistance to extinction. Hmm, I remember that in psychology, reinforcement schedules are used to determine how often a behavior is reinforced, and this affects how resistant the behavior is to extinction. Extinction is when the behavior stops because the reinforcement stops.

The question is asking which schedule results in behavior that's least resistant to extinction. So I need to figure out which schedule makes the behavior stop more easily when the reinforcement isn't given anymore.

Let me think about the different types of reinforcement schedules. There's continuous reinforcement, where every response is reinforced. I think that's Schedule CRF. But wait, isn't that the one where behavior is learned quickly but also extinguishes quickly because once the reinforcement stops, the behavior stops? Or is it the opposite?

Wait, no, I think continuous reinforcement actually makes the behavior very strong because it's always getting reinforced. But wait, if every response is reinforced, then the subject expects a reward every time. So if the reinforcement stops, the behavior would extinguish faster because the expectation isn't met. That makes sense. So continuous reinforcement leads to quick learning but quick extinction.

Then there are fixed ratio schedules. Fixed ratio means you get a reward after a certain number of responses. Like FR 10: every 10th response. I remember that fixed ratio schedules produce a high and steady rate of responding. But what about extinction? I think FR schedules are more resistant to extinction because the behavior is maintained by the expectation of a reward after a certain number of responses. So if you stop reinforcing, the subject might keep responding for a while, expecting the reward after the ratio is met.

Variable ratio schedules, on the other hand, are where the number of responses needed varies. Like, sometimes it's 5, sometimes 10, sometimes 3. This is supposed to create very high resistance to extinction because the subject never knows when the next reward is coming, so they keep responding persistently. Gambling is an example because the variable ratio schedule keeps people playing even when they're not winning for a while. So VR would have high resistance.

What about fixed interval? That's FI, where the reward comes after a fixed time interval. Like every 5 minutes. I think this produces a scallop-shaped response curve, where responding increases as the interval approaches. But in terms of extinction, I think FI is less resistant than FR or VR. Because if the reward doesn't come at the expected interval, the behavior might extinguish faster.

Wait, but the question is about which is least resistant. So we're looking for the schedule that leads to the quickest extinction when reinforcement stops. So which one is that?

So let me recap:

- Continuous: every response is reinforced. So if you stop reinforcing, the behavior stops quickly because each response isn't getting rewarded anymore. So maybe continuous is least resistant.

Wait, but wait, I might be getting this mixed up. I've heard that continuous reinforcement leads to quick acquisition but also quick extinction. So when the reinforcement is stopped, the behavior extinguishes faster.

On the other hand, variable ratio leads to the most resistance. So in the options, which one is continuous? Let me look at the options.

Options:

A: variable ratio → high resistance.

B: variable interval → similar to VR but with time.

C: fixed ratio with large ratio → FR with big ratio. Maybe more resistant than smaller ratios.

D: continuous with long intervals → Not sure. Wait, continuous would imply every response, but the option says "with long intervals" which doesn't make sense. Maybe that's a typo and it's fixed interval?

Wait, looking again. The options are:

A: variable ratio

B: variable interval

C: fixed ratio with large ratio

D: continuous with long intervals

E: continuous

F: fixed ratio

G: fixed interval

H: variable ratio with large ratio

I: variable ratio with small ratio

J: fixed interval with long intervals

So for continuous, the option is E: continuous.

Wait, but another option is D: continuous with long intervals. Wait, that's confusing because continuous reinforcement is every response, so long intervals wouldn't make sense. Maybe D is continuous reinforcement but with long intervals between trials? Not sure, but E is just continuous.

So if E is continuous, and D is continuous with long intervals... Hmm, perhaps D is a distractor.

So the question is which schedule results in behavior least resistant to extinction.

So the answer would be the schedule that causes the quickest extinction. From what I remember, continuous reinforcement (E) leads to quick extinction because when the reinforcement stops, each response isn't reinforced, so the behavior stops.

Alternatively, fixed interval might have a different pattern. Let me think again. In fixed interval, the reinforcement is given after a set time. For example, every 5 minutes, you get a reward. So during the interval, the subject might respond a lot towards the end but not much at the beginning. If the reinforcement stops, the next time the interval passes without a reward, the behavior might extinguish.

But in continuous reinforcement, every response is reinforced. So when reinforcement stops, every response isn't reinforced anymore. So the behavior would stop quickly.

So among the options, E is continuous, which leads to quick extinction. So the correct answer would be E.

Wait, but let me make sure. Another option is D: continuous with long intervals. But that doesn't make much sense because continuous reinforcement implies every response is reinforced, regardless of intervals.

Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing it with something else. Wait, perhaps the answer is fixed interval, because in fixed interval, the extinction occurs when the expected reward doesn't come, but in continuous, the extinction is immediate.

Wait, another way: which schedule produces the least resistance to extinction? So the one where behavior stops the fastest when reinforcement is stopped.

So, the hierarchy of resistance is: variable ratio > fixed ratio > variable interval > fixed interval > continuous.

So the least resistant would be continuous.

Yes, that's right. So the correct answer is E: continuous.

To determine which reinforcement schedule results in behavior that is least resistant to extinction, it is important to analyze how each schedule affects the persistence of behavior when reinforcement stops. Here's a breakdown of the key schedules:

1. **Variable Ratio (A, H, I):** This schedule, where the number of responses required for reinforcement varies, produces highly persistent behavior and is very resistant to extinction. This is because the uncertainty of reinforcement maintains high response rates.

2. **Fixed Ratio (C, F):** In this schedule, reinforcement is provided after a fixed number of responses. It generates steady and high response rates and is relatively resistant to extinction because the subject expects reinforcement after a predictable number of responses.

3. **Variable Interval (B):** Here, reinforcement is provided after an unpredictable time interval. This schedule also results in persistent behavior, though slightly less so than variable ratio.

4. **Fixed Interval (G, J):** Reinforcement is provided after a fixed time interval. This schedule produces a "scalloped" response pattern, with responding increasing as the interval approaches its end. It is less resistant to extinction than fixed ratio or variable schedules.

5. **Continuous Reinforcement (E):** In this schedule, every response is reinforced. While this leads to rapid learning, it also results in quick extinction when reinforcement stops because the behavior is not maintained by anticipation of future rewards.

6. **Continuous with Long Intervals (D):** This option is ambiguous and likely a distractor, as continuous reinforcement inherently implies reinforcement after every response, regardless of intervals.

Among these, **continuous reinforcement (E)** leads to the least resistance to extinction because the behavior is not sustained by expectations of future rewards. When reinforcement stops, the behavior extinguishes quickly.
