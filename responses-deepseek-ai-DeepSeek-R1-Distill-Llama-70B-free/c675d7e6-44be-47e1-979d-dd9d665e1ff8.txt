Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about business-led private regulation and why it's on the rise. Hmm, I remember from my studies that private regulation refers to rules and standards set by non-government entities, like companies or industry associations. But wait, why would businesses take on more self-regulation?

The question is asking about the factors that contribute to this rise. The sentence has three blanks. The first is about the approach from industry, the second and third are about achieving objectives. Let's break it down.

First blank: "encouragement of a _______ approach from industry." I think the options are proactive or reactive. Proactive means taking initiative, so if industry is being proactive, they might set their own standards before being forced by laws. That makes sense because companies might prefer to regulate themselves to avoid stricter government rules or to improve their reputation.

Second and third blanks: "_________ and _______ achievement of objectives." So these are two factors. The options include cost effectiveness, heightened costs, cost ineffectiveness, faster, slower. I think cost effectiveness is a likely candidate because businesses often aim to reduce costs. If private regulation is more cost-effective than government regulation, companies would prefer it. So the second blank might be cost effectiveness.

The third part is about how objectives are achieved. If it's proactive and cost-effective, then the achievement would be faster because companies can respond quickly without waiting for government actions. So the third blank would be faster.

Now looking at the options:

Option A: Proactive, Cost effectiveness, Faster. That fits what I was thinking.

Option E: Proactive, Cost effectiveness, Slower. Hmm, slower doesn't fit because proactive should mean quicker.

Other options have reactive, which I don't think is right because the rise is due to industry taking initiative, not reacting to something else. So Option A seems correct.

The rise in business-led private regulation is attributed to the encouragement of a proactive approach from industry, cost effectiveness, and faster achievement of objectives. This makes Option A the correct choice.
