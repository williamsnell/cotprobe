Okay, so I've got this question about energy intake and various energy terms. Hmm, let me think. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work it out step by step.

The question says that a healthy woman has a gross energy intake of 9279 kJ per day. Then, the energy from her faeces is 647 kJ, and her urine is 318 kJ. They're asking about her digestible energy intake and metabolizable energy intake.

Wait, I remember that in nutrition, the body doesn't absorb all the energy from the food we eat. So, first, there are different terms for the energy at each stage of digestion and metabolism.

Gross energy is the total energy in the food consumed. But then, some of that energy is lost in the faeces because not everything is digested. So the digestible energy (also called apparent digestible energy) would be the gross energy minus the energy lost in the faeces. Because whatever comes out as faeces wasn't absorbed. So that would be 9279 kJ minus 647 kJ.

Right, so digestible energy is gross intake minus faecal energy. So that's DE = 9279 - 647.

Then, what about metabolizable energy (ME)? I think ME is the energy that's actually available for the body's metabolic processes. But to get ME, you have to subtract more losses. Because even after absorption, some energy is lost in the urine. Oh wait, but wait—urine contains energy from metabolic processes, like the breakdown of proteins and other substances. So to get ME, you take the digestible energy and subtract the urinary losses. Because the energy lost in urine is part of the metabolic processes, not digestion.

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing it up. Let me think again. Maybe the metabolizable energy is the gross energy minus both faeces and urine. Because both faeces and urine are losses of energy that the body can't use. Or is that correct?

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The process goes like this: 

1. Gross Energy (GE) is the total energy consumed.

2. Digestible Energy (DE) is GE minus faecal energy (since faeces are undigested and not absorbed). So DE = GE - Faeces.

3. Then, Metabolizable Energy (ME) is DE minus the urinary losses. Because once the energy is absorbed, some is lost in urine. Or wait, is that correct? Or is it that ME is GE minus faeces and minus urine, because both faeces and urine are excreted and thus not used by the body.

Wait, no, I think the proper steps are:

The body takes in GE. Some comes out as faeces (not digested), so DE is GE - faeces.

But then, when the body metabolizes the nutrients, some energy is lost in the urine. So ME would be DE minus the energy lost in urine. So ME = DE - urine energy.

Which would make ME = (GE - faeces) - urine.

Wait, but another thought: in some contexts, faeces and urine are both excretory losses, so ME would be GE minus both. Because the body can't utilize the energy lost in either faeces or urine.

Wait, no, I think that's not correct because the energy in faeces is from undigested food, while the energy in urine is from substances that were digested but then excreted. So for ME, it's the energy that's metabolized. So ME would be the energy absorbed (which is DE) minus the urinary excretion. Or is the urinary excretion part of the metabolic process, and thus included in the ME?

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to find the correct definitions.

I remember that:

- Digestible Energy (DE) = Gross Energy (GE) - Faecal Energy Loss (FE).

Because the faeces are what's not digested, so DE is what's absorbed.

Then, Metabolizable Energy (ME) = DE - Urinary Energy Loss (UE), because the body uses the DE for metabolic processes, but some is excreted in urine, which is energy that's not used for metabolism (maybe like urea, which is a nitrogenous waste).

Wait, but another angle: sometimes, in animal nutrition, the ME is calculated as GE minus (faeces + urine + gases produced in the hindgut, like methane). But in human nutrition, I think it might be slightly different because humans don't produce as much methane as ruminants. Or wait, perhaps the question is considering only faeces and urine as the losses.

Wait, the question gives faeces and urine as the only losses. So, the woman's gross intake is GE. The faeces are the undigested part, so DE is GE - faeces. Then, from DE, the body uses some energy for metabolism, and some is lost in urine. So ME is DE - urine.

Alternatively, another approach: ME is the energy available for the body's use, including for maintenance, growth, and activity. So, ME would be the energy that the body retains after all losses.

So, the energy excreted in faeces is GE - DE. Then, the energy excreted in urine is part of the ME losses. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as:

GE → some lost in faeces (undigested)
The remaining is DE.
DE is then the energy available for metabolism, but some is lost in urine (maybe as urea or other substances).
So ME = DE - UE.

Wait, but then ME would be (GE - FE) - UE.

Alternatively, I've also heard that metabolizable energy is GE minus faeces, minus urine, minus gaseous losses (like methane). But in this problem, they only give faeces and urine. So perhaps the ME here would be GE - (FE + UE).

Wait, but then DE is GE - FE. So ME would be DE - UE.

So putting it all together:

DE = GE - FE = 9279 - 647.

ME = DE - UE = (9279 -647) - 318.

Which would be 9279 - (647 +318) = 9279 - 965 = 8314 kJ.

Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, if the ME is GE - FE - UE, that's the same as DE - UE.

So, in the options, I need to find which one matches DE = 9279 -647, and ME as 9279 -647 -318.

Looking at the options:

Option F says: 9279-647 kJ and 9279-(647+318). So DE is 9279-647, which matches. ME is 9279- (647+318) = 9279-965, which also matches.

Wait, another option is option C: 9279 - (318+647) for DE, which would be 9279-965, which is incorrect for DE. Because DE is GE - FE, not GE - (FE + UE). So C is incorrect.

Option F is DE = 9279-647, ME = 9279-647-318, which is correct.

Wait, let me double-check the options:

Option F: 9279-647 and 9279-(647+318).

Yes, that's what we have. So DE is 9279-647, ME is 9279 minus the sum of faeces and urine.

So the correct option should be F.

Looking through the options, option F is: 

9279-647 kJ and 9279-(647+318) kJ.

So the answer should be F.

To determine the average daily digestible energy (DE) and metabolizable energy (ME) intake for the healthy woman, we start with the given data:

- **Gross Energy (GE)** = 9279 kJ  
- **Faecal Energy Loss (FE)** = 647 kJ  
- **Urinary Energy Loss (UE)** = 318 kJ  

### Step 1: Calculate Digestible Energy (DE)
Digestible Energy (DE) is the portion of the gross energy that is absorbed by the body and not lost in the faeces. It is calculated as:

\[
DE = GE - FE
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
DE = 9279 - 647 = 8632 \, \text{kJ}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Metabolizable Energy (ME)
Metabolizable Energy (ME) is the energy available for metabolic processes after accounting for both faecal and urinary losses. It is calculated as:

\[
ME = DE - UE
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
ME = (9279 - 647) - 318 = 9279 - (647 + 318) = 9279 - 965 = 8314 \, \text{kJ}
\]

### Step 3: Match with the Options
From the calculations:
- **DE** = \( 9279 - 647 \, \text{kJ} \)
- **ME** = \( 9279 - (647 + 318) \, \text{kJ} \)

This matches **Option F**, which states:

\[
\text{DE} = 9279 - 647 \, \text{kJ}, \quad \text{ME} = 9279 - (647 + 318) \, \text{kJ}
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**F**
