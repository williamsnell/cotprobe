Okay, so I have this physics problem here about minimizing reflection by using a coating. Hmm, I remember that this is related to thin film interference. The goal is to find the right thickness of MgF2 to coat the glass so that the reflection is minimized for wavelengths around 550 nm. Wait, the question says wavelengths near the middle of the visible spectrum, which is about 550 nm, yeah.

I think when light hits a thin film, some of it reflects off the top surface and some goes through, reflects off the bottom, and then comes back up. These two reflected waves interfere with each other. For minimum reflection, they should destructively interfere. So their path difference must be an odd multiple of half-wavelengths, right?

Wait, the formula for the path difference is 2nt, where n is the refractive index of the film and t is its thickness. Oh wait, but I need to consider the phase changes. When light reflects off a medium with a higher refractive index, it undergoes a phase shift of 180 degrees (or pi radians). So in this case, the MgF2 is coated on glass. Glass has a higher refractive index than MgF2. Wait, MgF2's n is 1.38, and glass is usually around 1.5 or higher, right? So the first reflection (air to MgF2) is from low to high n, so it has a phase shift. The second reflection is MgF2 to glass, which is low to high again, so that also has a phase shift. Wait, but wait—when the second reflection happens, the light is going from MgF2 (lower n) to glass (higher n), so yes, that's another phase shift. 

Wait, but the two reflections both have a phase shift, so when the second reflection (the one that goes through the film) comes back, the total phase difference is from the path difference plus the phase shifts. But wait, each reflection only causes a phase shift if going from lower to higher n. So the first reflection at the air-MgF2 interface (air n=1, MgF2 n=1.38) causes a phase shift of λ/2 (pi shift). The second reflection is MgF2-glass (n=1.38 to ~1.5), which is also higher, so another λ/2 shift. So the two reflections have a total phase shift of λ between them. Wait, but wait! When you have both reflections causing a phase shift, the total is two times 180 degrees, so 360, which is the same as no phase shift. Because 360 degrees is a full cycle, so effectively no net phase change.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If both reflections have a phase shift, then the total phase difference between the two reflected waves is 2*(180 degrees) = 360 degrees. Since 360 is equivalent to 0 modulo 360, the net phase shift is zero. So the only phase difference comes from the path difference, which is 2nt. 

Wait but for destructive interference, the total phase difference should be (2m + 1) * pi, where m is an integer. Since the path difference contributes 2nt*(2pi/lambda) in phase, and the phase shifts contribute nothing because they cancel out, then 2nt = (m + 1/2) * lambda. Or wait, perhaps the condition is when the path difference plus any phase shifts equals half-integer multiples.

Alternatively, I think the condition is that the path difference should be an odd multiple of half-wavelengths. So 2nt = (m + 1/2) * lambda. But wait, when m is zero, that gives 2nt = lambda/2. So solving for t, t = lambda/(4n).

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify. The general condition for destructive interference (minimum reflection) when the two reflected waves are out of phase by a half-integer multiple of the wavelength. So the path difference is 2nt (because the wave goes down and back up, so twice the thickness). But including phase shifts.

In this scenario, both reflections have a phase shift of 180 degrees. So each reflection shifts the wave by pi. So the first reflected wave (top surface) has a phase shift of pi, and the second reflected wave (bottom surface) also has a phase shift of pi upon reflection. But wait, the second wave (transmitted into the film, then reflected) travels through the film twice (down and up), so its path is 2t. 

So the total phase difference between the two waves is:

Phase difference from path: (2t) * (2pi n / lambda) 

Plus any phase shifts. The first reflection (wave 1) has a phase shift of pi. The second reflection (wave 2) occurs at the MgF2-glass interface. If the wave is going from MgF2 to glass (higher n), it undergoes another phase shift of pi. But wait, wave 2 goes through the film (so path 2t), reflects, and then exits. So when it reflects, it's going from MgF2 (n=1.38) to glass (n=1.5), so higher n, which causes a phase shift of pi. So wave 2 has a phase shift of pi.

Wave 1: phase shift of pi.

Wave 2: phase shift of pi + path phase.

So the relative phase difference is (phase of wave 2) - (phase of wave 1) = [pi + (4 pi n t)/lambda ] - [pi] = (4 pi n t)/lambda.

Wait that can't be right, because the path difference is 2t, so the phase from the path is (2t)*(2pi n/lambda) )= 4 pi n t / lambda.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of destructive interference. For destructive interference, the two waves must be out of phase by (2m+1) pi, so the total phase difference is (2m+1) pi.

So the path difference is 2nt, and the phase difference from the path is (2 pi / lambda) * 2nt = 4 pi n t / lambda.

Additionally, the phase shifts: wave 1 has a phase shift of pi, wave 2 has a phase shift of pi as well. So the net phase shift between the two is pi (wave 1) minus pi (wave 2) = zero. Wait, no, because wave 2's phase includes the path phase plus its own phase shift.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model the total phase difference as the sum of path phase and any phase shifts. So wave 1: phase shift of pi (because reflection at air-MgF2, low to high n). Wave 2: after going through the film twice, it's phase is increased by (4 pi n t)/lambda (since each pass through t adds 2 pi n t / lambda). Then, upon reflection at MgF2-glass, it gets another phase shift of pi.

So wave 2's total phase is (4 pi n t)/lambda + pi.

Wave 1's phase is pi.

So the difference between wave 2 and wave 1 is [ (4 pi n t / lambda) + pi ] - [ pi ] = 4 pi n t / lambda.

For destructive interference, this difference should be (2m + 1) pi.

So setting 4 pi n t / lambda = (2m + 1) pi.

Divide both sides by pi: 4 n t / lambda = 2m +1

So solving for t:

t = ( (2m +1) lambda ) / (4 n )

We want the minimum thickness, so m=0.

So t = lambda/(4n)

Given lambda is 550 nm. Wait, the question says wavelengths near 550 mμ, which is the same as 550 nm.

But wait, when a film is on glass, the effective optical path is 2nt. So the condition for destructive interference is when 2nt = (m + 1/2) lambda.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it the standard way. The condition for minimum reflection is when the path difference is an odd multiple of half wavelengths.

So 2nt = (m + 1/2 ) lambda.

The minimum thickness is when m=0, so 2nt = lambda/2 → t = lambda/(4n).

Yes, that's the same as before.

So plugging in the numbers: lambda is 550 nm, n is 1.38.

t = 550 nm / (4 * 1.38) 

Calculating 4*1.38: 5.52.

So 550 /5.52 = let's compute that.

550 / 5.52 → let's see, 5.52 × 100 = 552. So 100 ×5.52 is 552. So if I take 99.8, 5.52 *99.8= approx 550. So 550 /5.52 ≈ 99.64 nm.

Wait, wait, but wait. The calculation: 550 /5.52 = ?

Let me do it more accurately.

5.52 × 100 = 552, which is 2 more than 550.

So 100 ×5.52 = 552 → 550 is 552-2= -2.

So 550 =5.52 × (100) - 2 → 550 =5.52 × (100 - (2/5.52)) )

But 2/5.52 is approximately 0.3626.

So 100 -0.3626 = 99.6374.

So 550/5.52 ≈ 99.637 nm.

Wait, but 99.637 nanometers is the thickness. 1 nm is 10^-9 meters, so 99.637 nm is 9.9637e-8 meters, which is 0.099637 micrometers (since 1 micrometer is 1e-6 m).

Wait, but the options are in micrometers (mμ). Let me convert 99.637 nm to micrometers.

1 micrometer is 1000 nm. So 99.637 nm is 0.099637 micrometers, which is approximately 0.1 micrometers.

Wait, looking at the options:

Looking at the options, which are in micrometers (mμ). Let's list them:

Option C:50 mμ → 0.05 micrometers → 50 nm.

Option G:75 mμ → 75 nm.

Option H:100 mμ → 100 nm.

Option I:125 mμ →125 nm.

Option D:175 mμ →175 nm.

Wait, my calculation got approximately 100 nm. So the closest option is H:100 mμ. But wait, my calculation is 99.6, which is just under 100. So perhaps option H is 100, which is very close.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, 550 nm is 550 nanometers. n=1.38.

t =550/(4 *1.38)=550/(5.52)≈99.64 nm.

Which is 0.09964 micrometers, or approximately 100 mμ as in option H.

But wait, looking at the options:

Option H is 100 mμ or 1.0 ×10^-5 cm.

Yes, because 1e-5 cm is 100 nm.

So the correct answer should be H.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again about the phase shifts. Did I consider them correctly?

Earlier, I thought that both reflections have a phase shift of pi. So the first wave (air-MgF2) has a phase shift of pi, and the second wave (MgF2-glass) also has a phase shift of pi.

So when the second wave comes back, its phase is path phase plus pi. The first wave's phase is pi.

So the difference is (path phase + pi) - pi = path phase.

So the path phase must be an odd multiple of pi for destructive interference.

So 2nt = (m + ½) lambda. So for m=0, 2nt = lambda/2 → t = lambda/(4n) → same as before.

So yes, the calculation is correct.

Therefore, the correct answer is option H: 100 mμ or 1.0 ×10^-5 cm.

To minimize reflection of wavelengths near the middle of the visible spectrum (550 nm), the thickness of the MgF₂ coating must be determined based on the condition for destructive interference. When light reflects off the top and bottom surfaces of the thin film, the two reflected waves interfere. For minimum reflection, the path difference between these waves must result in destructive interference.

The path difference is given by \( 2nt \), where \( n \) is the refractive index of the film and \( t \) is its thickness. Additionally, phase shifts due to reflection must be considered. Since both reflections (air-MgF₂ and MgF₂-glass) occur at interfaces where the refractive index increases, each reflection introduces a phase shift of \( \pi \). The net phase shift between the two reflected waves is therefore zero, as the two \( \pi \) shifts cancel out. Thus, the condition for destructive interference depends only on the path difference.

The condition for destructive interference is:

\[
2nt = \left( m + \frac{1}{2} \right) \lambda
\]

where \( m \) is an integer. For the minimum thickness, \( m = 0 \), so:

\[
2nt = \frac{\lambda}{2} \quad \text{or} \quad t = \frac{\lambda}{4n}
\]

Substituting \( \lambda = 550 \, \text{nm} \) and \( n = 1.38 \):

\[
t = \frac{550}{4 \times 1.38} = \frac{550}{5.52} \approx 99.64 \, \text{nm}
\]

This thickness is approximately \( 100 \, \text{nm} \), which corresponds to \( 100 \, \text{m}\mu \) or \( 1.0 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{cm} \).

From the given options, the correct choice is:

**H: 100 m\mu or 1.0 × 10⁻⁵ cm**
