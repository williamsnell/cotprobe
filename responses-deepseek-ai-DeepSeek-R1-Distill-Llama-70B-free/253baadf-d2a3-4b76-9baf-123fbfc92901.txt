Question:

An investor is looking to purchase a security for $100 with an initial margin of 50% (meaning the investor is using $50 of his money to purchase the security and borrowing the remaining $50 from a broker). In addition, the maintenance margin is 25%. At what price of the security will the investor receive a margin call?

Options:

A: 72.00
B: 55.00
C: 90.00
D: 60.00
E: 75.00
F: 70.00
G: 80.00
H: 66.67
I: 62.50
J: 85.00

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this margin call question. Hmm, let me think. I remember that margin calls happen when the value of the investment falls below a certain point, specifically related to the maintenance margin. 

So, the investor is buying a security for $100 with an initial margin of 50%. That means he's putting up $50, and the broker is lending him the other $50. The maintenance margin is 25%, which I think is the minimum amount of equity the investor must maintain in the account. 

Wait, so how does maintenance margin work? I think when the value of the security drops, the investor's equity in the account decreases. If the equity falls below the maintenance margin percentage, the broker will issue a margin call, requiring the investor to add more funds or sell the security.

Let's break it down. The initial purchase is $100. The investor uses $50, so the loan is $50. Equity is the investor's own money, which is $50 initially.

The formula I remember for determining when a margin call occurs is: 

Maintenance Margin = (Security Price * Number of Shares) * Maintenance Margin Percentage

But wait, maybe another approach is better. The maintenance margin is 25%, which is the percentage of the current value of the security that the investor's equity must be at least. So, the equity can't drop below 25% of the security's current value.

At what point does the equity equal 25% of the security's value? Let me set that up. 

The equity (E) is the value of the security (V) minus the loan amount (L). Because the loan is fixed at $50 unless more is borrowed. So, E = V - L. The maintenance margin requires that E >= 25% of V.

So, setting up the equation: V - L >= 0.25 * V.

Wait, wait. Let me plug in the numbers. The loan L is $50.

So, V - 50 >= 0.25 * V.

Let me solve for V. Subtract 0.25V from both sides:

V - 0.25V - 50 >= 0.

0.75V -50 >=0.

0.75V >=50.

V >= 50 / 0.75.

Calculating that, 50 divided by 0.75 is 66.666... So approximately $66.67.

So when the security's price drops to $66.67, the equity (which is 66.67 -50 = $16.67) equals 25% of the security's value (0.25 *66.67=16.6675). So that's the point where the maintenance margin is just met. If it drops any lower, the investor will get a margin call.

Looking at the options, option H is 66.67. So the correct answer should be H.
</think>

To determine the price at which the investor will receive a margin call, we need to calculate when the equity in the account falls below the maintenance margin of 25%. The investor initially purchases a $100 security with a 50% initial margin, meaning they contribute $50 and borrow $50 from the broker. The maintenance margin requires that the investor's equity (the value of the security minus the loan) remains at least 25% of the security's current value.

Let \( V \) represent the price of the security. The equity in the account is \( V - 50 \), and the maintenance margin condition is:

\[
V - 50 \geq 0.25V
\]

Solving for \( V \):

\[
V - 0.25V \geq 50
\]
\[
0.75V \geq 50
\]
\[
V \geq \frac{50}{0.75}
\]
\[
V \geq 66.67
\]

When the security's price drops to $66.67, the equity equals 25% of the security's value, which is the threshold for a margin call. If the price falls below this, the investor will receive a margin call.

From the options provided, the correct answer is **H: 66.67**.
