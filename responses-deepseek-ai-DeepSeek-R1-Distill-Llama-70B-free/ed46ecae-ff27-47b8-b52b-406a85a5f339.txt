Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the photoelectric effect. Hmm, I remember that the photoelectric effect involves electrons being ejected from a metal when light of a certain frequency shines on it. The key idea is that there's a minimum energy required, called the work function, which the photon must have to eject the electron.

The question says that the work function for potassium is 4.33 eV, and I need to find the wavelength of a photon with that energy. Oh right, because the photon's energy has to be at least equal to the work function to cause emission. 

I think the first step is to convert the energy from electron volts (eV) to another unit, like ergs, because the Planck constant (h) is given in erg-seconds. Wait, I remember that 1 eV is equal to 1.602 x 10^-12 ergs. So I can multiply 4.33 eV by that conversion factor to get the energy in ergs.

Let me jot that down: E = 4.33 eV * 1.602e-12 erg/eV. Calculating that gives E = approximately 6.94e-12 ergs. Hmm, wait let me check the multiplication. 4 * 1.602e-12 is 6.408e-12, and 0.33 * 1.602e-12 is about 0.528e-12, so adding them gives around 6.936e-12 ergs. Yeah, that seems right.

Now, I remember the equation E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength. I need to solve for λ, so rearranging the equation gives λ = hc/E.

Plugging in the numbers: h is 6.626e-27 erg-sec, c is 2.998e10 cm/s, and E is 6.94e-12 ergs. So λ = (6.626e-27 * 2.998e10) / 6.94e-12.

Let me compute the numerator first. 6.626e-27 multiplied by 3e10 is roughly 1.9878e-16 (since 6.626 * 3 is about 19.878, and exponents: 1e-27 * 1e10 = 1e-17, so 19.878e-17 is 1.9878e-16). But wait, 6.626 * 2.998 is a bit less than 20. Let me calculate it more accurately: 6.626 * 3 is 19.878, but since 2.998 is 0.002 less than 3, the product is 6.626*(3 - 0.002) = 19.878 - 0.013252, which is approximately 19.86475. So 19.86475e-17? Wait, no, because 6.626e-27 * 2.998e10 = (6.626 * 2.998) * 1e(-27+10) )= 19.864e-17, which is 1.9864e-16 erg·cm.

Now, divide that by E, which is 6.94e-12 erg. So λ = (1.9864e-16 erg·cm) / (6.94e-12 erg) = (1.9864 / 6.94 )e-4 cm. Let me compute 1.9864 divided by 6.94. Let's see, 6.94 times 0.286 is approximately 1.986... because 6.94 * 0.28 = 1.9432, and 6.94 * 0.286 is 1.986 (since 0.006 *6.94=0.0416, so 1.9432 +0.0416=1.9848, which is close to 1.9864). So approximately 0.286 when multiplied by 6.94 gives about 1.9864. 

So λ ≈ 0.286e-4 cm. Wait, 1e-4 cm is 1000 Angstroms (since 1 cm is 1e8 Angstroms, so 1e-4 cm is 1e4 Angstroms, wait no, wait: 1 cm = 10^8 Å, so 1e-4 cm = 10^4 Å, which is 10,000 Å. But wait, 0.286e-4 cm is 2.86e-5 cm. Wait, no, I think I mixed up the exponents.

Wait, λ is (1.9864e-16) / (6.94e-12) = (1.9864 /6.94 ) * 1e-4 cm. Because 1e-16 / 1e-12 = 1e-4. So 1.9864/6.94 is approximately 0.286. So 0.286e-4 cm. Now, 1e-4 cm is 1e-6 meters, but let's convert it to Angstroms. Since 1 cm is 1e8 Angstroms (because 1 m is 1e10 Angstroms, 1 cm is 1e8). So 0.286e-4 cm is (0.286e-4 cm) * (1e8 Å/cm) = 0.286e4 Å. Because 1 cm =1e8 Å, so 1e-4 cm is 1e4 Å. So 0.286 *1e4 Å = 2860 Å. 

Looking at the options, option C is 2864 Å, which is very close. So the correct answer should be C.

To determine the wavelength of a photon with energy equal to the photoelectric work function of potassium (4.33 eV), we start by converting the energy from electron volts (eV) to ergs. Using the conversion factor \(1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{erg}\), the energy is:

\[
E = 4.33 \, \text{eV} \times 1.602 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{erg/eV} = 6.936 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{erg}.
\]

Next, we use the relationship between energy, Planck's constant (\(h\)), and the speed of light (\(c\)):

\[
E = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \quad \text{or} \quad \lambda = \frac{hc}{E}.
\]

Substituting the given values \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-27} \, \text{erg·s}\), \(c = 2.998 \times 10^{10} \, \text{cm/s}\), and \(E = 6.936 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{erg}\):

\[
\lambda = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-27}) (2.998 \times 10^{10})}{6.936 \times 10^{-12}}.
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
6.626 \times 10^{-27} \times 2.998 \times 10^{10} = 1.986 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{erg·cm}.
\]

Now divide by \(E\):

\[
\lambda = \frac{1.986 \times 10^{-16}}{6.936 \times 10^{-12}} = 2.864 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{cm}.
\]

Convert \(\lambda\) to Ångströms (\(1 \, \text{cm} = 10^8 \, \text{Å}\)):

\[
\lambda = 2.864 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{cm} \times 10^8 \, \text{Å/cm} = 2864 \, \text{Å}.
\]

Thus, the wavelength of the photon is approximately **2864 Å**, which corresponds to option **C**.
