Okay, so I have this question about psychology theories and gender-role development. Hmm, the question says that parents play more roughly with male children and are more protective of female children. I need to figure out which theory this supports.

Let me think about the different theories. I remember that social learning theory suggests that we learn behaviors by observing and imitating others, like parents. So if parents are acting a certain way with their kids, the kids might pick up on that. Roughhousing with boys might teach them to be more aggressive or assertive, while being protective of girls might teach them to be more nurturing or cautious.

Wait, what about cognitive development? That's more about how children think and understand the world, like Piaget's stages. It doesn't directly tie into how parents' behavior shapes gender roles through observation.

Identity theory... I'm not too sure about that. Maybe it's about how individuals form their sense of self, but I don't recall it focusing on parental behavior in this way.

Cultural theory would involve broader societal influences, like media or traditions, but the question specifically mentions parents, so maybe it's more about direct interaction rather than the culture at large.

Biological theory would look at genetics and hormones. While that's important, the question is about parental behavior, which is an environmental factor, not biological.

Constructivist theory, like from Vygotsky, emphasizes how people construct their knowledge through social interactions. But I'm not certain how directly that applies here. It's more about language and collaboration.

Psychoanalytic theory, from Freud, deals with the unconscious mind and stages of development. It might talk about identification with parents, but the specific roughhousing and protectiveness seems more about learning through observation rather than unconscious drives.

Gender schema theory is about how children develop mental frameworks (schemas) about gender. They might start to understand what behaviors are expected based on their gender. So if parents treat sons and daughters differently, that reinforces certain schemas. But I'm not sure if this is the best fit compared to social learning.

Psychodynamic theory is similar to psychoanalytic, focusing on internal conflicts and past experiences. Again, not exactly about observing and imitating behaviors.

Evolutionary psychology looks at traits that have evolved because they provided a survival advantage. Like, maybe males being more aggressive because in the past it helped in hunting or protecting. But the question is about current parental behavior influencing the child, not evolutionary reasons for why the behavior exists.

So, putting it all together. The scenario describes parents modeling certain behaviorsâ€”roughhousing with boys and being protective with girls. This seems to fit with social learning theory because the children are likely observing and imitating these behaviors, learning what's expected of their gender through their parents' actions. Social learning is all about learning through observing and imitating models, so this makes sense.

Wait, but gender schema theory is also about organizing information based on gender. So when parents behave differently, the child incorporates that into their schema. So the child expects that boys behave roughly and girls are more delicate. Hmm, which theory is more about the actual behavior and learning from it?

I think social learning is more about the behavior and the reinforcement, while gender schema is more about the cognitive structures. Since the question is about the parents' actions influencing the child's gender role development, social learning theory (F) seems to fit best because it's about learning through observation and imitation of behaviors.

The question asks which theory of gender-role identity development is most consistent with parents playing more roughly with male children and being more protective of female children. 

- **Cognitive Development (A):** Focuses on how children think and understand the world, not on parental behavior shaping gender roles.
- **Identity Theory (B):** Involves how individuals form their sense of self, not specifically about parental interactions.
- **Cultural Theory (C):** Involves broader societal influences, not direct parental behavior.
- **Biological Theory (D):** Examines genetics and hormones, not environmental factors like parental behavior.
- **Constructivist Theory (E):** Emphasizes knowledge construction through social interactions, but not specifically about gender roles through observation.
- **Social Learning (F):** Suggests learning behaviors by observing and imitating others, such as parents modeling gender-specific behaviors.
- **Psychoanalytic Theory (G):** Focuses on unconscious drives, not observational learning.
- **Gender Schema (H):** Involves cognitive frameworks about gender, but less about direct behavioral imitation.
- **Psychodynamic Theory (I):** Focuses on internal conflicts, not observational learning.
- **Evolutionary Psychology (J):** Explains traits through evolution, not current parental behavior.

The scenario describes parents modeling gender-specific behaviors, which aligns with **Social Learning Theory (F)**, as it emphasizes learning through observation and imitation. While Gender Schema Theory (H) also applies, Social Learning Theory better fits the focus on parental behavior influencing gender roles through direct observation.
