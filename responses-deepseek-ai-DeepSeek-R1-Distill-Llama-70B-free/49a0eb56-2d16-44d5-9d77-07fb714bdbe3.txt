Okay, so I've got this Gibbs free energy question here, and I'm a bit nervous because thermodynamics can be a bit tricky for me. Let's see what the question is asking.

Alright, the problem says that the pressure and temperature at the center of the Earth are 3 × 10^6 atm and 4000°C respectively. I need to estimate the change in the Gibbs function, ΔG, for a reaction going from the crust to the core. The given changes in volume (ΔV) are 1 cm³ mol⁻¹ and the change in entropy (ΔS) is 2.1 J K⁻¹ mol⁻¹.

Wait, right. The Gibbs free energy change under non-standard conditions is given by the equation ΔG = ΔG° + RT ln Q, but wait, no, that's when considering reaction quotient Q. Oh wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Another formula I remember is when you're considering the effect of pressure and temperature on Gibbs free energy.

Oh right! The Gibbs equation when considering changes in pressure and temperature. I think the formula is ΔG = VΔP - SΔT. Or wait, is it ΔG = VΔP + SΔT? No, wait. Let me think carefully.

Gibbs free energy is related to the maximum reversible work done by the system at constant temperature and pressure. The general equation for the change in Gibbs free energy when both pressure and temperature change is ΔG = VΔP - SΔT, or is it the other way around? Hmm.

Wait, the correct formula is ΔG = VΔP - SΔT. Let me make sure. So, when pressure increases (ΔP is positive) and temperature increases (ΔT positive), the Gibbs free energy change would be influenced by both terms.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about the differential of G. The differential dG is given by dG = V dP - S dT. So when we have changes in P and T, the change in G would be the integral of that. So assuming V and S are constant over the changes (which might be an approximation here), then ΔG = V (P2 - P1) - S (T2 - T1).

Wait, but wait—the question mentions going from the crust to the core. So the initial state is crust (where I assume P is lower) and the final state is core (higher P and higher T).

So P increases from crust to core, so ΔP = P_core - P_crust. Similarly, T increases, so ΔT = T_core - T_crust.

But wait, what are the initial conditions? The problem doesn't specify the crust's P and T. Hmm, perhaps the problem is considering a process where the reaction is happening under the conditions of the core, so maybe we're looking at the Gibbs free energy change at those conditions relative to standard conditions (which are 1 atm and 25°C, perhaps?).

Wait, no. The question says the change in Gibbs function on going from the crust to the core. So perhaps we can model this as moving from some initial P and T (crust) to the given P and T (core). But since the problem doesn't provide the crust's P and T, perhaps it's assumed that the initial P is 1 atm and the initial T is 25°C (standard conditions). That makes sense because otherwise we wouldn't have enough information.

So, let's proceed with that assumption. So initial P is 1 atm, initial T is 25°C (which is about 298 K). The final P is 3e6 atm, final T is 4000°C (which is 4273 K, since 4000 + 273 = 4273 K).

So, now compute ΔG for this change. The formula is:

ΔG = V (P2 - P1) - S (T2 - T1)

Wait, but wait—wait, no. Because the Gibbs free energy change when moving from initial to final conditions (P1, T1) to (P2, T2) is given by:

ΔG = ΔV (P2 - P1) - ΔS (T2 - T1)

Wait, but wait! Because ΔG is for the process of the reaction under those conditions. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is ΔG = ΔV (P2 - P1) - ΔS (T2 - T1). Let me double-check.

Yes, I think that's correct. Because when you change the pressure and temperature, the Gibbs function change for the system is the sum of the work done (VΔP) and the entropy term (SΔT), but with a negative sign for the entropy term.

So, given that, let's plug in the numbers.

First, process the units:

ΔV is given as 1 cm³/mol. I need to convert that to m³/mol because the standard unit for pressure in SI is Pascals (N/m²), and 1 atm is about 101325 Pascals.

1 cm³ is 1e-6 m³ (since 1 m³ = 1e6 liters = 1e6 * 1e3 cm³ = 1e9 cm³? Wait, no. Wait, 1 m³ = 10^3 liters. 1 liter is 1000 cm³, so 1 m³ = 10^3 * 10^3 cm³ = 10^6 cm³. So 1 cm³ = 1e-6 m³.

So ΔV = 1e-6 m³/mol.

ΔP = P2 - P1 = 3e6 atm - 1 atm = 2.999e6 atm ≈ 3e6 atm (since 3e6 is much larger than 1 atm, so maybe we can approximate it as 3e6 atm).

But wait, need to convert atm to Pascals because the units for G are in J (which is m³·Pa).

So 1 atm = 101325 Pa. So 3e6 atm = 3e6 * 101325 Pa.

Let me compute that: 3e6 * 1e5 is 3e11, but precise calculation: 3e6 * 101325 = 3 * 1e6 * 101325 = 3 * 1.01325e5 = 3.03975e8 Pa? Wait, wait no:

Wait, 3e6 * 101325 = 3e6 * 1.01325e5 = (3 * 1.01325) * 1e11? Wait, 1e6 * 1e5 is 1e11. So 3 * 1.01325 = 3.03975, so 3.03975e11 Pa.

Wait, but that seems really high. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, 1 atm is 101325 Pa. So 3e6 atm is 3e6 * 101325 Pa. Let me compute 3e6 * 1e5 = 3e11, but 101325 is about 1.01325e5.

So 3e6 * 1.01325e5 = (3 * 1.01325) * (1e6 * 1e5) )= 3.03975 * 1e11 = 3.03975e11 Pa.

Wait, that's a huge pressure. But the center of the Earth does have such high pressures, so it's plausible.

Next, ΔP = 3e6 atm - 1 atm = approx 3e6 atm. But when converted to Pa, it's 3.03975e11 Pa.

Wait, but wait—since the initial P is 1 atm, the ΔP is (3e6 -1) atm ≈ 3e6 atm. So yes, using 3e6 atm is acceptable.

So, let's compute VΔP:

V is 1e-6 m³/mol.

ΔP is 3.03975e11 Pa.

So VΔP = (1e-6 m³/mol) * (3.03975e11 Pa) = (1e-6) * (3.03975e11) = 3.03975e5 J/mol.

Because Pa is N/m², and m³·Pa = N·m = J. So yes, this gives J/mol.

So VΔP ≈ 3.04e5 J/mol, which is 304,000 J/mol or about 304 kJ/mol.

Next, compute SΔT.

ΔS is given as 2.1 J/(K·mol). The temperature change is T2 - T1.

T1 is 25°C = 298 K.

T2 is 4000°C = 4273 K.

So ΔT = 4273 K - 298 K = 3975 K.

So SΔT = (2.1 J/(K·mol)) * (3975 K) = 8341.5 J/mol.

Wait, 2.1 * 3975. Let me compute that:

2 * 3975 = 7950.

0.1 * 3975 = 397.5.

Total: 7950 + 397.5 = 8347.5 J/mol.

So SΔT is 8347.5 J/mol.

Now, putting it all together:

ΔG = VΔP - SΔT.

Wait, but wait—is it VΔP - SΔT? Because the formula is ΔG = VΔP - SΔT.

So:

VΔP = 3.03975e5 J/mol ≈ 303975 J/mol.

SΔT = 8347.5 J/mol.

So ΔG = 303975 - 8347.5 = ?

Compute 303975 minus 8347.5:

303975 - 8000 = 295,975.

295,975 - 347.5 = 295,627.5 J/mol.

Wait, no, wait:

Wait, 303975 - 8347.5.

Let me compute:

303975.0

-   8347.5

= 303975 - 8347.5 = ?

Well, 303975 - 8000 = 295,975.

Then subtract 347.5: 295,975 - 347.5 = 295,627.5 J/mol.

So ΔG ≈ 295,627.5 J/mol, which is 295.6275 kJ/mol.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see a 295 kJ option. Let me check the options again.

Options are:

A: 8.3 kJ/mol⁻¹

B: 15 kJ/mol⁻¹

C: 500 kJ/mol⁻¹

D: 8347.5 J/mol⁻¹ → 8.3475 kJ/mol⁻¹

E: 300 kJ/mol⁻¹

F: 29.17 kJ/mol⁻¹

G: 3.5 kJ/mol⁻¹

H: 2.917 kJ/mol⁻¹

I: 291.7 kJ/mol⁻¹

J: 600 J/mol⁻¹ → 0.6 kJ/mol⁻¹

Hmm, none of the options are near 295 kJ. The closest is option C: 500 kJ, and option I: 291.7 kJ. Wait, option I is 291.7 kJ, which is close to 295.6.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recheck the numbers.

Wait, let's recalculate VΔP:

ΔV = 1 cm³/mol = 1e-6 m³/mol.

ΔP = 3e6 atm.

Convert atm to Pa: 1 atm = 101325 Pa.

So 3e6 atm = 3e6 * 101325 = 3.03975e11 Pa.

So VΔP = 1e-6 m³ * 3.03975e11 Pa = 3.03975e5 J/mol.

Which is 303,975 J/mol.

Now, SΔT: 2.1 J/K/mol * (4273 - 298) K = 2.1 * 3975 = 8347.5 J/mol.

So ΔG = 303975 - 8347.5 = 295,627.5 J/mol → 295.6275 kJ/mol.

Looking at the options, the closest is option I: 291.7 kJ/mol. But wait, why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of ΔT.

Wait, 4000°C is 4000 + 273 = 4273 K.

25°C is 298 K.

So ΔT = 4273 - 298 = 3975 K.

So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses Kelvin directly, but that wouldn't change much. Let me recheck the numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps I have the formula wrong. Maybe it's ΔG = VΔP + SΔT?

Wait, earlier I thought the formula was ΔG = VΔP - SΔT. But if the correct formula is ΔG = VΔP + SΔT, that would change the calculation.

Wait, let me think again about the Gibbs equation.

The differential form is dG = V dP - S dT.

So when moving from (P1, T1) to (P2, T2), the change is:

ΔG = ∫(from P1 to P2) V dP - ∫(from T1 to T2) S dT.

Assuming V and S are constant during the process, which is an approximation but perhaps acceptable here.

So yes, it's V (P2 - P1) - S (T2 - T1).

So the calculation seems correct.

So why is there no option near 295 kJ? Let's look at the options again.

Option I is 291.7 kJ. Hmm, wait—could I have made a mistake in the calculations?

Wait, perhaps I should recompute 2.1 * 3975:

2.1 * 3975.

Compute 2 * 3975 = 7950.

0.1 * 3975 = 397.5.

Total is 7950 + 397.5 = 8347.5 J.

That's correct.

VΔP is 303,975 J.

So 303,975 - 8,347.5 = 295,627.5 J → 295.6275 kJ.

No option exactly matches this. The closest is option I: 291.7 kJ.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects to ignore the initial pressure and temperature, taking P1 as 0 and T1 as 0? That wouldn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different approach, like assuming standard conditions but using just the given P and T.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the equation ΔG = ΔV * P + ΔS * T. No, that doesn't make sense dimensionally.

Alternatively, perhaps it's using the Gibbs equation at constant temperature and pressure, but that's not the case here.

Wait, another approach: the Gibbs free energy at the core conditions can be calculated as ΔG = ΔG° + RT ln Q, but without Q, that might not be the way.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. The problem states "estimate the change in the Gibbs function, ΔG of reaction on going from the crust to the core." So perhaps it's the Gibbs free energy change when the reaction occurs under the core conditions, relative to the crust conditions.

Wait, another thought—maybe the question is referring to the Gibbs free energy of the system when moved from the crust (ambient conditions) to the core (high P and T). So perhaps the formula used is ΔG = VΔP - SΔT, which is what I did.

So I end up with about 295.6 kJ/mol.

Looking at the options, option I is 291.7 kJ. The difference is about 3.9 kJ, which is noticeable. So perhaps I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, let me recompute VΔP and SΔT.

VΔP:

1 cm³ is 1e-6 m³.

ΔP = 3e6 atm → 3e6 * 101325 Pa = 3.03975e11 Pa.

So VΔP = 1e-6 m³ * 3.03975e11 Pa = 3.03975e5 J → 303,975 J.

SΔT:

2.1 J/K/mol * 3975 K = 8347.5 J.

So ΔG = 303975 - 8347.5 = 295,627.5 J → 295.6275 kJ.

Hmm, perhaps the problem uses different units for volume? Let me double-check the units.

Wait, the problem states ΔV is 1 cm³ mol⁻¹. So 1 cm³ = 1e-6 m³. Correct.

Pressure: 3e6 atm. Correct.

So I think the calculation is right, but perhaps the options are expecting a different approach.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem considers the Gibbs free energy change as ΔG = ΔV × ΔP × something, or perhaps uses a different formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the given ΔV and ΔS are for the reaction under standard conditions, and the question is asking for the Gibbs free energy change under the core's conditions.

Wait, the standard Gibbs free energy ΔG° is calculated at standard conditions (1 atm, 25°C). So perhaps the problem wants the Gibbs free energy at the core's conditions, calculated using ΔG = ΔG° + (VΔP - SΔT).

But wait, in that case, we don't know ΔG°, so perhaps the problem is assuming that ΔG under the core's conditions is just VΔP - SΔT.

Wait, but that's what I did earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula used is ΔG = VΔP + SΔT. If that's the case, the calculation would be 303975 + 8347.5 = 312,322.5 J → 312.3 kJ. The options don't have that either.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1) - SΔT, but that doesn't fit because we don't have moles or R.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something about the units. Let me recheck the calculations.

Wait, another approach: Maybe instead of using P in Pa, the problem expects the use of pressure in terms of atm and volume in cm³.

But that complicates things because the units wouldn't directly give J.

Alternatively, let me compute VΔP in J using cm³ and atm.

1 cm³·atm = 0.101325 J (since 1 L·atm =
