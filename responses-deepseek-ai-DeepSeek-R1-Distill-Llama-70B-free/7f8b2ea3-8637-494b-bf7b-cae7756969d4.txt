Question:

A woman was hit in the right eye by a shard of glass when her car was rear-ended by an industrial truck. She was hospitalized, lost her eye, and had several operations over several years. She could not return to work as an apprentice ballet dancer due to loss of coordination, constant headaches, and severe disfigurement. She is considered totally disabled. She had been training for the ballet for many years and, at the trial against the tortfeasor, she proved that she was considered a bright and uncoming student. The defendant claimed that this was still too speculative whether she would have been successful. The trial court disagreed and allowed evidence on the lost earning capacity of a ballet dancer. The jury awarded $3 million. Will the appellate court likely reverse the verdict due to the lost earning capacity issue?

Options:

A: No, the jury's award is discretionary and inviolate, and it may not be disturbed with respect to personal injury damages.
B: No, because some imprecision in the evidence regarding loss of earning capacity is to be expected and is not grounds for excluding the evidence.
C: Yes, the evidence did not guarantee or assure anyone that she really would have been a successful professional ballet dancer.
D: Yes, she can only collect for lost work that she held prior to the accident; her future lost earning capacity could be based on an apprentice ballet dancer.

Alright, so I've got this question about tort law, specifically dealing with damages for lost earning capacity. Hmm, okay, let's try to break this down.

So, the scenario is a woman who was in a car accident, lost her eye, had multiple operations, and can't return to her job as an apprentice ballet dancer. She's considered totally disabled. At trial, she presented evidence about her lost earning capacity as a ballet dancer, and the jury awarded $3 million. The defendant argues that it's too speculative whether she would have succeeded, and now we're wondering if the appellate court will reverse the verdict because of that.

The options are A through D. Let me think about each part.

First, I remember that when someone is injured, they can recover for lost earning capacity, not just actual earnings. This is especially important for people who might not be working yet but have the potential to earn in the future, like students or, in this case, an apprentice training to be a ballet dancer.

But wait, how certain does it need to be that she would have succeeded? I think the standard isn't that she definitely would have made it, but rather that there's a reasonable probability. So even if there's some uncertainty, as long as there's enough evidence to support a reasonable expectation, the damages can be awarded.

In this case, she's been training for many years and was considered a bright and upcoming student. That suggests she had a good chance, even if it's not a guarantee. The trial court allowed the evidence, so the jury considered it.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the jury's award is discretionary and can't be disturbed. I think that's not entirely accurate. While juries have discretion, appellate courts can reverse if the damages are found to be unsupported or excessive based on the evidence. So A might not be correct.

Option B states that some imprecision is okay, so evidence isn't excluded. That makes sense because exact calculation isn't always possible, especially for future earnings. Courts usually allow some leeway here as long as there's a basis for the claim. So B seems plausible.

Option C argues that the evidence didn't guarantee success, so the award should be reversed. But I thought the law doesn't require a guarantee, just a reasonable probability. So C might be incorrect because it's setting the bar too high.

Option D says she can only collect for past work, not future as an apprentice. But I think future lost earning capacity is recoverable if it's reasonably probable. As an apprentice, she's in training, so her future earnings as a professional dancer could be part of the calculation. So D doesn't seem right because it limits recovery too much.

So putting it together: since the trial court allowed the evidence based on reasonable probability, and some imprecision is acceptable, the appellate court likely won't reverse. So the answer would be B.

The appellate court is unlikely to reverse the verdict because the evidence presented met the required standard for lost earning capacity. While the defendant argued that the outcome was too speculative, the law does not require a guarantee of success but rather a reasonable probability. The plaintiff's years of training and status as a promising student provided a sufficient basis for the jury to consider her future earning potential as a ballet dancer. Some imprecision in calculating future damages is acceptable, and the trial court correctly allowed the evidence. Therefore, the appellate court will likely affirm the jury's award.

Answer: B
