Okay, so I've got this evidence law question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read through it carefully.

The situation is a robbery trial. The defendant took the stand and testified in his own defense. On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked him if he had committed false pretenses by making long-distance calls using a stolen credit card number. The defendant denied it, saying, "That's a lie, I never did." 

Then, in rebuttal, the prosecutor called a court officer who testified that the defendant admitted to committing false pretenses. But wait, the court officer also said that the defendant was granted immunity in exchange for his testimony against others. So the question is about whether the court officer's testimony is admissible.

The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm. Let me break this down. So the defendant is on trial for robbery, but during cross, the prosecutor is asking about an unrelated crime—false pretenses. The defendant denies it. Then the prosecutor brings a witness to say the defendant admitted to it, but also mentions the immunity deal.

I remember that when a defendant takes the stand, they can be impeached with prior convictions or specific instances of conduct, but there are rules about what can be used for impeachment.

Wait, but the defendant denied committing this other crime. So the prosecutor is trying to show that the defendant is lying, which would affect his credibility.

So the court officer is testifying that the defendant admitted to the crime. But wasn't that testimony given under immunity? So the defendant was granted immunity for his testimony against others. Does that affect the admissibility here?

I think about the use of prior statements. If the defendant made an admission, that's an exception to hearsay as a statement against interest, maybe? Or perhaps it's not hearsay because it's being offered for a purpose other than the truth of the matter.

Wait, no. The court officer is testifying about what the defendant said. So the statement is being offered to prove that the defendant committed the false pretenses, which would contradict his testimony. So the prosecutor is trying to show he's lying, which affects credibility.

But wait, evidence of other crimes is generally inadmissible unless it's for impeachment. So if the defendant is a witness, the prosecutor can attack his credibility with evidence of prior convictions or specific acts. But is this about a prior conviction or a specific act?

The defendant wasn't convicted of the false pretenses, but he admitted to it under immunity. So the court officer's testimony is about the defendant's admission, not a conviction.

I think that specific instances of conduct can be used to impeach a witness's credibility, even if they're not convictions. So under FRE 608(b), specific instances of a witness's conduct can be used to attack credibility, but the conduct can't be proved by extrinsic evidence if it's about a specific act that wasn't resulting in a conviction. Wait, no—FRE 608(b) says that specific instances of conduct (other than conviction) can be inquired into on cross-examination but cannot be proved by extrinsic evidence. So if the defendant is a witness, on cross, you can ask him about specific bad acts, but you can't bring in other evidence to prove those acts unless they resulted in a conviction.

Wait, but here, the defendant is the accused, testifying in his own defense. So the rules about impeachment of a witness would apply to him. So if the prosecutor asks him about the false pretenses on cross, and he denies it, can the prosecutor then bring extrinsic evidence to rebut that?

I remember that for a witness, when you attack their credibility, you usually can't use extrinsic evidence unless it's a fact that would independently be relevant. So if the defendant denies a specific bad act, can the prosecution bring someone else to testify that he did it? Or is that considered extrinsic evidence, which is not allowed under FRE 608(b)?

Wait, no, maybe that's for prior bad acts not resulting in conviction. Because under 608(b), specific instances can be asked about on cross, but extrinsic evidence isn't allowed. So the prosecution can't bring in another witness to prove the specific act unless it's a conviction.

But in this case, the court officer is testifying about the defendant's admission. So the defendant's own statement. If the statement is being offered as a prior inconsistent statement, that's different.

Wait, but prior inconsistent statements can be used as substantive evidence if they were given under oath at a prior proceeding. But here, the defendant's admission was made in exchange for immunity, so perhaps it's not under oath in a proceeding? Or maybe it was part of a plea or something else.

Alternatively, the prior statement isn't necessarily a prior inconsistent statement for impeachment, but rather an admission by a party opponent, which is an exception to hearsay.

Wait, but the defendant's statement would be an admission by a party-opponent under FRE 801(d)(2)(A), so it's not hearsay. So the court officer's testimony about the defendant's admission is admissible as non-hearsay.

But the issue is about whether the prosecution can use extrinsic evidence to impeach the defendant's credibility on a specific act. Because under FRE 608(b), if the defendant is a witness, you can ask him about specific instances of conduct on cross, but you can't bring extrinsic evidence to prove those acts unless they resulted in a conviction.

Wait, but the defendant's admission is an out-of-court statement. So if the prosecutor is trying to prove that the defendant committed the false pretenses, that's a specific act. But if the defendant is a witness, the prosecution can't bring extrinsic evidence to prove that specific act unless it's a conviction.

So in this case, the court officer's testimony is extrinsic evidence of a specific act that didn't result in a conviction. Therefore, under FRE 608(b), it's inadmissible because you can't prove specific instances by extrinsic evidence unless it's a conviction.

Wait, but isn't the defendant testifying, and the prosecutor is impeaching him with a prior bad act? So the issue is whether the court officer's testimony is admissible for that purpose.

Alternatively, perhaps the testimony is admissible to show that the defendant's in-court denial is false, thus attacking his credibility. But the rules say that extrinsic evidence of specific acts is not allowed for impeachment unless it's a conviction.

So in this case, the court officer is offering extrinsic evidence of a specific act (the admission) that didn't result in a conviction, so it's inadmissible. So the court officer's testimony would be inadmissible as extrinsic evidence under FRE 608(b).

Wait, but the question says that the defendant was granted immunity. Does that affect anything? Because if the defendant was immunized, his compelled testimony can't be used against him in a criminal case. But here, the prosecution is using the defendant's statement (the admission) against him. So maybe that's a problem under the Fifth Amendment.

Wait, but the defendant made the statement in exchange for immunity. So the prosecutor can't use that statement against him because of the grant of immunity. So perhaps the court officer's testimony is inadmissible because the statement was made under immunity, making it inadmissible as evidence against the defendant.

But wait, the prosecutor is using it to impeach the defendant's credibility, not to prove the truth of the matter asserted. Or is it being used for both? Because if the statement is an admission, it's being used for the truth, which would be hearsay unless it's an exception.

Alternatively, perhaps the statement is admissible as a prior inconsistent statement. But prior inconsistent statements can be used as substantive evidence only if they were given under oath at a prior proceeding. If the defendant's admission was made in exchange for immunity, maybe it wasn't under oath in a proceeding, so it might not qualify.

Wait, but if the statement is an admission by a party-opponent, it's not hearsay. So FRE 801(d)(2)(A) says that a statement is not hearsay if it's offered against a party and was made by the party's own statement. So the defendant's admission would qualify as an admission by a party-opponent, so it's admissible as non-hearsay.

But then, the issue is whether it's admissible for impeachment purposes, considering the rules on extrinsic evidence.

So under FRE 613, prior inconsistent statements can be used to impeach a witness. But generally, the rule is that extrinsic evidence of specific acts (other than convictions) is inadmissible to impeach a witness's credibility. So if the defendant denied committing the crime on the stand, the prosecutor can't bring in another witness to contradict him on that specific act unless it's a conviction.

Wait, no, because FRE 613 deals with prior inconsistent statements, which can be used to impeach, but the extrinsic evidence is allowed if the statement is relevant for any purpose other than contradicting the witness. So if the prior statement is relevant as substantive evidence, then it can be admitted.

Wait, but in this scenario, the defendant's statement is an admission, which is substantive evidence. So the prosecution could offer it as an admission, making it admissible. But the initial issue is whether the court officer's testimony is admissible.

Wait, but the defendant is the one who made the statement, so the court officer's testimony about it isn't hearsay because it's a party admission. So that part is okay.

But then the issue is whether the court officer's testimony is admissible to impeach the defendant's credibility. Because the defendant testified that he didn't commit the crime, and the prosecution is bringing in a witness who says he admitted to it.

But under the rules, when a witness's credibility is attacked, you can bring extrinsic evidence only if it's a conviction or if it's a prior inconsistent statement that's admissible as substantive evidence.

Wait, so if the prior statement is substantive evidence (like an admission), then the extrinsic evidence is admissible. So in this case, the court officer's testimony about the defendant's admission would be admissible as an admission by a party opponent, making it non-hearsay and thus admissible to show the defendant's guilt. But wait, the crime is robbery, and the prior act is false pretenses. So it's a different crime. But the prosecutor is using it to impeach the defendant's credibility, not necessarily to prove the robbery.

Alternatively, the prosecutor might be trying to show that the defendant has a tendency to commit crimes, but that's generally not admissible unless it's for impeachment.

Wait, but the defendant is on trial for robbery, and the prior act is false pretenses. So the two are unrelated. So the evidence is being offered to show that the defendant is lying when he denied it, thus impeaching his credibility.

So under FRE 608(b), specific instances of conduct that aren't resulting in a conviction can be used to attack credibility, but only on cross-examination, not through extrinsic evidence. So the prosecutor can ask the defendant about it on cross, but can't bring in another witness to testify about it.

In this case, the prosecutor is bringing in a witness, which is extrinsic evidence of a specific act. So that's not allowed under FRE 608(b). Therefore, the court officer's testimony is inadmissible because it's extrinsic evidence of a specific act that didn't result in a conviction.

So looking at the options, let's see:

Option J says inadmissible because it's extrinsic evidence. That seems to fit.

Option D says inadmissible because the defendant had immunity. But the immunity affects the use of the statement against him, but since it's a party admission, maybe it's still admissible. But maybe the immunity makes the statement inadmissible because it's protected under the Fifth Amendment. Hmm. Wait, if the defendant was granted immunity, his compelled testimony can't be used against him. But here, he's making a statement in exchange for immunity, which could be considered compelled. So using it against him would violate his rights because he was compelled to make it.

Wait, but the Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination would prevent the use of compelled statements against the defendant. So if he was given immunity, and then made the statement, can the prosecution use it against him? I think that's the case. Because when you're granted immunity, you're compelled to testify, and that testimony can't be used against you. So using his statement against him would be a violation.

So maybe the court officer's testimony is inadmissible because the statement was made under immunity and thus can't be used against the defendant. So that would make option D correct: inadmissible because the defendant was granted immunity.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The defendant's statement was made under a grant of immunity, so he was compelled to make it. Under Kastigar v. U.S., use immunity protects a witness from having their compelled testimony used against them. So the prosecutor can't use the defendant's statement against him because it was compelled under immunity.

So even though it's a party admission, since it was compelled, it can't be used against him. So the court officer's testimony about the defendant's admission would be inadmissible because it's based on a compelled statement granted immunity.

So option D says "inadmissible, as the defendant was granted immunity for his testimony." That sounds correct.

Alternatively, if the statement wasn't compelled but was voluntary, then it would be admissible. But here, it's in exchange for immunity, so it's compelled.

So I think the correct answer is D.

Wait, but earlier I thought it's about extrinsic evidence under FRE 608(b), but now I'm thinking it's about the Fifth Amendment and immunity. Which one applies?

I think both points could be made, but the more specific issue here is the immunity. Because even if the testimony were admissible under evidence rules, the Fifth Amendment would prohibit its use.

So the court officer's testimony is inadmissible because the defendant was granted immunity, making option D correct.
</think>

The defendant, on trial for robbery, testified in his own defense and denied committing false pretenses during cross-examination. The prosecutor then called a court officer who testified that the defendant had admitted to committing false pretenses but also revealed that the defendant was granted immunity in exchange for his testimony against others. The question is whether the court officer's testimony is admissible.

The key issue revolves around the admissibility of the defendant's statement, made under a grant of immunity. Under the Fifth Amendment, statements made under immunity are compelled and cannot be used against the defendant in a criminal prosecution. This protection applies even if the statement would otherwise qualify as an admission by a party-opponent under the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE 801(d)(2)(A)). Therefore, the court officer's testimony about the defendant's admission is inadmissible because it is based on a compelled statement made under immunity.

Additionally, while the prosecution might argue that the testimony is relevant to impeach the defendant's credibility, the rules of evidence (FRE 608(b)) prohibit the use of extrinsic evidence to prove specific instances of conduct that did not result in a conviction. However, the more critical issue here is the constitutional protection against using compelled statements, which makes the testimony inadmissible regardless of its relevance for impeachment.

Thus, the court officer's testimony is inadmissible because the defendant was granted immunity for his testimony, and the statement cannot be used against him.
