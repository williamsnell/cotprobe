Okay, so I need to figure out which constitutional provision allows Congress to enact a statute that prohibits racial discrimination in real estate transactions. Hmm, I remember that there are several amendments and clauses that deal with civil rights and equal protection. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is about a federal law that stops racial discrimination in selling, transferring, or renting real estate. So, Congress passed this law. I need to find the constitutional basis for this.

I recall that the Fourteenth Amendment is a big one here. It has the Equal Protection Clause, which says states can't deny equal protection under the law. But wait, does that apply to the federal government? No, the Fourteenth Amendment applies to states. So maybe that's not the direct authority here.

Wait, but there's Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. That gives Congress the power to enforce the amendment by legislation. So if the law is meant to prevent state violations of equal protection, Congress can use Section 5 to pass laws addressing that. But wait, in this case, the statute is about private discrimination, not just state action. So would Section 5 cover that?

I think the Supreme Court has rulings on this. Like, in Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was upheld under the Commerce Clause. But that was about public accommodations. But this real estate question might be different.

Alternatively, there's the Thirteenth Amendment, which abolished slavery and gives Congress the power to enforce it through legislation. The Thirteenth Amendment's Section 2 allows Congress to pass laws against badges and incidents of slavery, like racial discrimination. So maybe that's a possibility. The Supreme Court case Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co. held that Congress can prohibit private racial discrimination in property sales under the Thirteenth Amendment.

So if the law is about preventing racial discrimination in real estate, which is a badge of slavery, Congress can use Section 2 of the Thirteenth Amendment as the basis. That would make option G the correct answer. Let me check the options again.

Option B is Section 5 of the Fourteenth, which I thought might not cover private discrimination as broadly. Option G is the enforcement of Section 2 of the Thirteenth. Yeah, that seems right based on Jones v. Mayer. So the answer should be G.

The correct answer is based on the constitutional provision that allows Congress to enact legislation prohibiting racial discrimination in real estate transactions. The Thirteenth Amendment, Section 2, grants Congress the authority to enforce the abolition of slavery and its "badges and incidents," which includes racial discrimination. This was upheld in *Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co.*, where the Supreme Court ruled that Congress could prohibit private racial discrimination in property sales under this provision.
