Okay, so I've got this problem here about a TV manufacturing firm that lowered the price of their deluxe portable TVs. I need to figure out if their decision was a good one in terms of increasing revenues and profits. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, the original price was $350 per unit, and they sold 1,000 units a month. Then they lowered the price to $320, and sales went up to 1,080 units. The production costs didn't change, so I guess the cost per unit is the same before and after.

I think I should calculate the revenues and profits before and after the price change. Revenue is just price times quantity sold, right? And profit would be total revenue minus total costs. But wait, since the unit production costs didn't change, I can maybe focus on the change in revenue and see how it affects profits.

Let me compute the original revenue. That's $350 per TV times 1,000 units. So 350 * 1000 is $350,000. After the price change, the new revenue is $320 * 1,080. Let me calculate that: 320 * 1000 is 320,000, and 320 * 80 is 25,600. So total new revenue is 320,000 + 25,600 = $345,600. Wait, that's actually less than the original $350,000. So revenue decreased? That can't be right. Did I do that math correctly?

Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. 320 * 1,080. Let me do 1,080 * 300 = 324,000 and 1,080 * 20 = 21,600. So adding 324,000 + 21,600 gives $345,600. Oh wait, same as before. So revenue went down from 350,000 to 345,600. So the firm's revenues actually decreased a bit. Interesting.

But wait, the question says they wanted to increase both revenues and profits. So if revenues went down, does that mean the decision wasn't good? Or maybe I'm missing something because I didn't consider costs.

Ah, right. Profit is revenue minus costs. So I need to calculate the profit before and after. Let's see. The problem doesn't give the production cost, but it says unit production costs didn't change. So let me assign a variable for that. Let's say the cost per unit is C. So total cost before was 1000*C, and after it's 1080*C.

Original profit would be (350 * 1000) - (1000 * C) = 350,000 - 1000C.
New profit is (320 * 1080) - (1080 * C) = 345,600 - 1080C.

So to find if profit increased, I'll compare the two:

New Profit - Original Profit = (345600 - 1080C) - (350000 - 1000C)
= 345600 - 1080C - 350000 + 1000C
= (345600-350000) + (-80C)
= (-4,400) -80C.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me see. Let me factor it differently.

Actually, let's compute the change in profit:

New Profit = 320*1080 - 1080C = 345600 - 1080C.

Old Profit = 350*1000 - 1000C = 350000 - 1000C.

Change in profit = (345600 - 1080C) - (350000 - 1000C)
= 345600 - 1080C - 350000 + 1000C
= (345600 - 350000) + (-80C)
= (-4,400) -80C.

Hmm, so the change is negative 4,400 minus 80 times C. Wait, but without knowing the value of C, I can't directly say if the change is positive or negative. That complicates things because the problem doesn't provide the cost.

Wait, maybe there's another approach. Since the question is about whether the decision was good, maybe I should think about whether their revenues and profits increased. From the initial calculation, revenue decreased, but perhaps profit increased.

Wait, but without knowing the cost, how can I determine the change in profit? The problem must give enough information. Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another thought: Maybe instead of calculating absolute profits, I can look at the impact of the price change on total revenue and then see if the additional units sold compensate for the lower price.

Wait, the price was lowered by $30 (from 350 to 320), but the quantity sold increased by 80 units. So, the revenue change is (320 - 350) * 1080 + 350 * 80. Wait, let me think again.

Alternatively, revenue change can be calculated as the change in price times the new quantity plus the original price times the change in quantity.

Wait, Revenue = P * Q.

Change in Revenue = (New P - Old P) * New Q + Old P * (New Q - Old Q).

So that would be (-30) * 1080 + 350 * 80.

Calculating that: -30 * 1080 = -32,400. 350 *80=28,000. So total change is (-32,400) +28,000= -4,400. Which matches the earlier revenue calculation (350,000 vs 345,600, a drop of 4,400). So the revenue decreased by $4,400.

But the question is whether this was a good decision for profits. If revenue went down, but costs might have gone up because they're producing more units. Wait, no, the unit cost didn't change, but total costs increased because they made more units. So total costs before were 1000C, now 1080C.

Profit before: 350,000 - 1000C.

Profit after: 345,600 - 1080C.

So the change in profit is (345600 -1080C) - (350000 -1000C) = -4400 -80C.

So, the change is negative 4400 minus 80C. So profit decreased by (4400 +80C). So unless 80C is negative, which it's not, profit decreased.

Wait that can't be, because if the firm sells more units, maybe the per unit cost is lower? But the problem says unit production costs did not change, so each unit still costs C to make, regardless of the number produced.

So, the firm's costs went up by 80C because they made 80 more units. So, their total costs increased.

But their revenue went down by 4,400. So their profit, which is revenue minus costs, went down by 4,400 plus the additional 80C they spent. So profit definitely decreased.

Wait, but that's not considering possible economies of scale. Oh, but the problem states that unit production costs did not change, so no economies of scale here. So each unit is still costing C, so the extra units just add 80C to the total cost.

So, the overall impact is that profit decreased by (4400 + 80C). Since C is positive, profit went down. So the decision to lower the price caused a decrease in both revenues and profits. Or wait, the revenue also decreased, as we saw.

Wait, but the options don't all have both revenues and profits down. Let me look at the options.

Options:

A: Poor decision

B: No effect

C: Good decision

D: Increased profits

E: Increased profits but not revenues

F: Increased revenues but decreased profits

G: No effect on rev but increased profits

H: Decreased both rev and profits

I: No effect on profits but increased rev

J: Increased rev but not profits.

Wait, wait, from my calculations, both revenue and profit decreased. So which option says that revenues and profits decreased? Looking at the options, option H says "decreased both revenues and profits". 

But wait, looking back, the initial revenue was 350,000, new is 345,600, so revenue decreased by 4,400. Profit decreased by 4,400 + 80C. So both are down. Therefore, the decision was a poor one, because both revenues and profits went down, meaning H is correct, perhaps. 

Wait, but option H is "The decision decreased both revenues and profits." So if that's the case, then the decision was bad because they wanted to increase both. So the correct answer would be H. But wait, let me check the options again.

Wait, looking at the options, H is "the decision decreased both revenues and profits." So that would be the case here. So the decision was a bad one because both went down. So the correct answer would be H, but let me think about the initial question again.

Wait, the question is asking if the decision was a good one. And the options are about whether it was good or not. Wait, no, the options are more about what effect the decision had. So the question is phrased, "Was their decision to lower prices a good one?" So, the decision's goodness depends on whether it achieved their goals of increasing revenues and profits.

They wanted to increase both. But according to the calculations, both decreased. So the decision was a poor one (option A) or perhaps H.

Wait, but the options are about the effect, not the goodness. Wait, let me read the options correctly.

The options are:

A: The decision was a poor one.

B: The decision had no effect.

C: The decision was a good one.

D: The decision increased profits.

E: The decision increased profits but not revenues.

F: The decision increased revenues but decreased profits.

G: The decision had no effect on revenues but increased profits.

H: The decision decreased both revenues and profits.

I: The decision had no effect on profits but increased revenues.

J: The decision increased revenues but not profits.

Wait, H says both decreased. So if that's correct, then the decision was bad. So the answer would be H. But let's make sure.

But wait, I must have made a mistake. Because the firm's profit is revenue minus cost. So let me try an example with real numbers to see. Assume the unit cost is, say, $200. Let's plug in numbers.

Original situation:

Price = $350, units sold = 1000.

Revenue = 350 *1000 = 350,000.

Total cost = 1000 *200 = 200,000.

Profit = 350,000 - 200,000 = $150,000.

New situation:

Price = $320, units sold = 1080.

Revenue = 320 *1080 = 345,600.

Total cost = 1080 *200 = 216,000.

Profit = 345,600 - 216,000 = $129,600.

So profit decreased from 150,000 to 129,600, a decrease of $20,400. And revenue decreased from 350,000 to 345,600, a decrease of $4,400. So both revenue and profit are down. So the decision was bad for both. So option H is correct.

But let me try another unit cost to check. Suppose C is $250.

Original profit: 350,000 - (1000*250) = 350,000 -250,000= 100,000.

New profit: 345,600 - (1080 *250)= 345,600 - 270,000=75,600.

Again, profit decreased by 24,400. Revenue down, profit down.

Another test: C is $300.

Original profit: 350,000 - 300,000=50,000.

New: 345,600 - (1080*300)= 345,600 - 324,000=21,600. Still profit down.

Wait, but what if the unit cost is very low? Let's say C is $100.

Original profit: 350,000 - 100,000=250,000.

New: 345,600 - (1080*100)=345,600 -108,000=237,600.

Still, profit decreased.

Alternatively, what if C is $0? Unlikely, but let's see.

Original profit: 350,000.

New profit: 345,600. So profit decreased by 4,400.

So regardless of the value of C, the profit decreased because the drop in revenue outweighed the increase in units sold. Because the increase in units (80) wasn't enough to offset the lower price per unit.

So the conclusion is that both revenues and profits decreased, making the decision a bad one. So the correct answer is H, which says both decreased.

But wait, looking back at the options, option A says "the decision was a poor one." So which is correct, A or H?

The question is whether the decision was a good one. The options mix statements about being good or not, and about revenues and profits. Let me see the options again.

Option A says the decision was a poor one.

Option H says the decision decreased both revenues and profits.

So, if both revenues and profits decreased, then the decision was a poor one. So A would be correct if H is correct. But I'm a bit confused because the options don't all use the same criteria.

Wait, looking back, the question is to choose from A to J, each of which gives a statement about the effect. So the correct answer is H because it correctly states that both revenues and profits decreased.

But wait, let me read the question again. It says, "was their decision to lower prices a good one?" The options don't all state whether it's good or bad, some just state effects.

So the correct answer would be option H, because it states that both revenues and profits decreased, which means the decision was bad. So the answer is H.
</think>

To determine if the decision to lower the price was a good one, we analyze the impact on revenues and profits. The original price was $350 per unit with 1,000 units sold, resulting in a revenue of $350,000. After the price reduction to $320, sales increased to 1,080 units, yielding a new revenue of $345,600. This represents a decrease in revenue of $4,400.

Next, we calculate the profit before and after the price change. Let the unit production cost be \( C \). The original profit was:

\[
\text{Profit}_{\text{original}} = (350 \times 1000) - (1000 \times C) = 350,000 - 1000C
\]

The new profit is:

\[
\text{Profit}_{\text{new}} = (320 \times 1080) - (1080 \times C) = 345,600 - 1080C
\]

The change in profit is:

\[
\Delta \text{Profit} = (\text{Profit}_{\text{new}} - \text{Profit}_{\text{original}}) = (345,600 - 1080C) - (350,000 - 1000C) = -4,400 - 80C
\]

Since \( C > 0 \), the change in profit is negative, indicating that profits decreased. Additionally, the revenue decreased by $4,400. Therefore, both revenues and profits declined as a result of the price reduction.

Given that the firm aimed to increase both revenues and profits, the decision to lower the price was not successful. The correct answer is:

**H: The decision decreased both revenues and profits.**

H
