Question:

 In response to the argument that embryos are not persons because they lack certain rights that all persons have (such as the right to life), Lee and George argue that

Options:

A: the right to life belongs to all living creatures, human or not.
B: the right to life belongs to a human being at all times that he or she exists.
C: only beings capable of experiencing pain should be given the right to life.
D: the right to life is not a relevant concept when discussing embryos.
E: the right to life applies only to beings capable of thought and self-awareness.
F: embryos have potential personhood and therefore should be given the right to life.
G: not all persons have the right to life-for example, a murderer has given up his or her right to life through his or her actions
H: all of the above
I: the right to life does not apply to embryos because they are not independent beings.
J: the right to life is granted at birth and not before.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about a philosophical argument regarding embryos and personhood. Hmm, the question is about what Lee and George argue in response to the claim that embryos aren't persons because they lack certain rights, like the right to life.

Alright, I remember that in philosophy, especially in debates about abortion and embryo rights, the concept of personhood is a big deal. Some argue that personhood begins at a certain point, like when the fetus can feel pain or when it's viable, while others argue that it begins at conception.

The question says that someone is arguing embryos aren't persons because they lack rights that all persons have, specifically the right to life. So Lee and George must be responding to that. I think Lee and George are philosophers who argue for the personhood of embryos, so they must have a counterargument here.

Looking at the options, I need to figure out which one aligns with their stance. Let me go through each option:

Option A: The right to life belongs to all living creatures, human or not. That seems too broad. I don't think that's their argument because it would include plants and animals, which isn't the focus here.

Option B: The right to life belongs to a human being at all times that he or she exists. Oh, this sounds familiar. I think Lee and George argue that being human is enough, regardless of the stage of development. So from conception onwards, the right to life applies because it's a human being.

Option C: Only beings capable of experiencing pain should have the right to life. That doesn't sound right because embryos in early stages might not feel pain, so this would exclude them, which isn't what Lee and George would say.

Option D: Right to life isn't relevant for embryos. No, that's the opposite of their position. They do think it's relevant.

Option E: Right to life applies only to beings capable of thought and self-awareness. Again, embryos don't have that, so this would argue against their personhood, which isn't Lee and George's view.

Option F: Embryos have potential personhood and should have the right to life. Potential personhood is an argument I've heard before, but I think Lee and George argue that embryos are actual persons, not just potential. So maybe this isn't their main point.

Option G: Not all persons have the right to life, like murderers. That seems like a different argument about desert rather than the nature of personhood. Not sure if that's relevant here.

Option H: All of the above. Unlikely because the options don't all fit together cohesively.

Option I: Right to life doesn't apply because embryos aren't independent. That's another argument against embryo rights, so not what Lee and George would say.

Option J: Right to life is granted at birth. Again, that's the opposing view, so not their argument.

So, putting it all together, Lee and George's response is probably that the right to life applies to all human beings at every stage of their existence, which is option B. They argue that being human is sufficient for having the right to life, regardless of the stage of development, so embryos qualify.

The question revolves around Lee and George's response to the argument that embryos are not persons because they lack certain rights, such as the right to life. Lee and George are known for arguing that embryos are persons and should be granted the right to life. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** suggests the right to life applies to all living creatures, which is too broad and not specific to human embryos.  
- **Option B** aligns with Lee and George's stance that the right to life belongs to human beings at all stages of existence, making it the most plausible choice.  
- **Options C, E, and J** argue for criteria like pain, thought, or birth, which exclude embryos and contradict Lee and George's view.  
- **Option D** claims the right to life isn't relevant for embryos, which opposes their position.  
- **Option F** mentions potential personhood, but Lee and George argue for actual, not potential, personhood.  
- **Option G** introduces an unrelated argument about murderers and desert.  
- **Option I** focuses on independence, which is not their argument.  
- **Option H** is incorrect because not all options align with their stance.  

Thus, Lee and George argue that the right to life applies to all human beings, including embryos, at every stage of existence.
