Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. But let's take it step by step.

The question is asking me to calculate C_p minus C_v for water at 40°C. The given data includes the coefficient of thermal expansion, compressibility, and density. Hmm, I remember that there's a relation involving these terms to find the difference between heat capacities at constant pressure and constant volume.

Wait, right! I think the formula is C_p - C_v equals something involving the thermal expansion coefficient (alpha), the isothermal compressibility (kappa), and maybe the density (rho). Oh wait, and temperature T, because everything depends on T.

Let me recall the formula. I think it's derived from the thermodynamic identity for heat capacities. Oh yes, the formula is:

C_p - C_v = (T * V) * (α² / κ)

Wait, no, wait. I think I might have that mixed up. Another approach: The relation connects the two heat capacities with other thermodynamic properties. Maybe it's:

C_p - C_v = (T * V) * (alpha)^2 / beta_T

Where beta_T is the isothermal compressibility. Oh, right, beta_T is 1/kappa, where kappa is the compressibility. So substituting that:

C_p - C_v = T * V * alpha^2 * kappa

Wait, no, wait another moment. Let me think again. The correct formula is C_p - C_v = (T V) (α)^2 / beta_T.

But beta_T is the compressibility, which is defined as beta_T = - (1/V) (dV/dP)_T. So beta_T is kappa, which is given as 44.82e-6 atm^-1.

Wait, but let me get the exact formula right. I think the correct relation is:

C_p - C_v = (T * V_m) * (alpha)^2 / beta_T

Where V_m is the molar volume. Oh wait, wait! Wait, but in the formula, V is the volume, but maybe when dealing with specific heat per mole, it's better to think in terms of molar quantities.

Alternatively, another approach: the Mayer relation for an ideal gas is C_p - C_v = nR, but water isn't an ideal gas, so that doesn't apply here. So the general form must involve the other thermodynamic properties.

Wait, let me think carefully. The general thermodynamic relation comes from the identity:

C_p - C_v = T (dP/dT)_V (dV/dT)_P

Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another approach is to express it in terms of alpha and beta_T.

The formula I found in my notes is C_p - C_v = T V (alpha^2) / beta_T

Yes, that seems right. So I need to compute this.

Given that, let's note the given values:

Coefficient of thermal expansion (alpha) = 385.30e-6 K^-1

Compressibility (kappa) = 44.82e-6 atm^-1

Density (rho) = 0.9922187e3 kg/m³. Oh wait, that's 992.2187 kg/m³.

Wait, what about the molar mass of water? Because I need the molar volume. So first, I can compute the molar volume.

Molar mass of H2O is about 18.01528 g/mol, which is 0.01801528 kg/mol.

Molar volume V_m = molar mass / density.

So V_m = (0.01801528 kg/mol) / (992.2187 kg/m^3 )

Let me compute that numerically.

Wait first, 992.2187 kg/m³ is 992.2187 kg per cubic meter. So 0.01801528 kg/mol divided by 992.2187 kg/m³ equals (0.01801528 / 992.2187) m³/mol.

Let me compute that:

0.01801528 / 992.2187 ≈ approx 1.817e-5 m³/mol.

Wait, let me calculate it accurately:

992.2187 is approximately 1000, so 0.018 / 1000 is 1.8e-5. But let me compute it precisely.

0.01801528 / 992.2187 = 

Let me compute 0.01801528 divided by 992.2187.

Wait, 992.2187 is 9.922187e2. So 0.01801528 / 9.922187e2 = 0.01801528 / 992.2187.

Let me compute 0.01801528 ÷ 992.2187.

Well, let's do the division:

992.2187 goes into 0.01801528 how many times? Let's convert to scientific notation.

0.01801528 = 1.801528e-2.

So 1.801528e-2 / 9.922187e2 = (1.801528 / 9.922187) ) * 1e-4.

Computing 1.801528 / 9.922187 ≈ approx 0.1815.

So approximately 0.1815e-4 = 1.815e-5 m³/mol.

So about 1.815e-5 m³/mol.

But wait, let me double-check with a calculator approach.

Wait, 0.01801528 divided by 992.2187.

Let me compute using approximate steps:

992.2187 * 1.8e-5 = 992 * 1.8e-5 = 17.856e-3 = 0.017856.

But our numerator is 0.01801528, which is slightly larger. So 1.8e-5 times 992 is 0.017856, which is less than 0.01801528.

The difference is 0.01801528 - 0.017856 = 0.00015928.

So how much more?

992.2187 * x = 0.00015928.

x = 0.00015928 / 992.2187 ≈ approx (1.5928e-4) / 992.2187 ≈ approx 1.604e-7.

So x is about 1.604e-7.

So total is 1.8e-5 + 1.604e-7 = approximately 1.81604e-5 m³/mol.

So V_m is approximately 1.816e-5 m³/mol.

Now, the formula is C_p - C_v = T * V_m * (alpha)^2 / beta_T.

Wait, but wait. Are alpha and beta_T given per Kelvin and per atm? Because units are important here.

Let me make sure about the units.

Alpha is given as 385.30e-6 K^-1. So that's 3.853e-4 K^-1.

Beta_T is compressibility, 44.82e-6 atm^-1. So 4.482e-5 atm^-1.

Now, let's plug the numbers into the formula.

T is 40°C, which is 313.15 K.

So,

C_p - C_v = (313.15 K) * (1.816e-5 m³/mol) * (3.853e-4 K^-1)^2 / (4.482e-5 atm^-1)

Wait, but wait a second. Units might be tricky here. Let me check the units.

The term (alpha)^2 has units of (K^-1)^2.

V_m is in m³/mol.

Beta_T is in atm^-1.

So let's compute each part step by step.

First, compute (alpha)^2:

(3.853e-4 K^-1)^2 = (3.853)^2 * 1e-8 K^-2.

3.853 squared is approximately 14.847. So 14.847e-8 K^-2 = 1.4847e-7 K^-2.

Now, multiply by V_m: 1.816e-5 m³/mol.

1.816e-5 m³/mol * 1.4847e-7 K^-2 = (1.816 * 1.4847) * 1e-12.

1.816 * 1.4847 ≈ let's compute:

1.8 * 1.48 is roughly 2.664, and 0.016 *1.4847≈0.02373, so total ≈ 2.6877.

So approximately 2.6877e-12 m³ K^-2 / mol.

Now multiply by T:

313.15 K * 2.6877e-12 m³ K^-2 / mol = 313.15 * 2.6877e-12.

313 * 2.6877 is approx 313 * 2.6 is 813.8, 313 *0.0877 ≈ approx 27.5. So total about 841.3.

So 841.3e-12 → 8.413e-10 m³ / (mol K).

Now, divide by beta_T (4.482e-5 atm^-1):

So (8.413e-10 m³/(mol K)) ) / (4.482e-5 atm^-1) )

Which is (8.413e-10) / (4.482e-5) ) * (m³/(mol K atm^-1)).

Wait, units: m³/(mol K) divided by (atm^-1) → m³·atm/(mol·K).

Wait, because dividing by (atm^-1) is same as multiplying by atm.

So the units become m³·atm/(mol·K).

Wait, but wait. Let me think: 1 atm is roughly 101325 Pascals, and 1 Pa is 1 N/m². So 1 atm = 101325 N/m².

So m³·atm is m³ * 101325 N/m² = 101325 N·m = 101325 J.

So m³·atm = 101325 J.

Hmm, but perhaps that's getting ahead of myself. Let's first compute the numerical value.

Compute 8.413e-10 / 4.482e-5.

Which is approximately (8.413 /4.482) )e-5.

8.413 /4.482 ≈ approx 1.877.

So 1.877e-5 m³·atm/(mol·K).

Wait, but wait, because 8.413e-10 /4.482e-5 = (8.413 /4.482) * 1e-5.

Because 1e-10 /1e-5 = 1e-5.

So yes, 1.877e-5 m³·atm/(mol·K).

Now, 1 m³·atm is equal to 101325 J. So to convert this to J/(mol·K), we multiply by 101325.

So, 1.877e-5 m³·atm/(mol·K) * 101325 J/(m³·atm) = 1.877e-5 * 101325 J/(mol·K).

Compute 1.877e-5 * 1e5 (approximately) → 1.877e0 = 1.877 J/(mol·K).

Wait, 101325 is approximately 1.01325e5.

So 1.877e-5 * 1.01325e5 = (1.877 * 1.01325) * (1e-5 * 1e5) ) = (1.902) * 1e0 = 1.902 J/(mol·K).

Wait, that would result in approximately 1.902 J/(mol·K), which is about 1.9 J/mol·K.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.905 J/mol·K. So that's very close.

Wait, but did I make a miscalculation in the steps?

Let me double-check.

Wait, first the formula: C_p - C_v = T V (alpha^2) / beta_T.

Wait, wait a second. Oh no! Wait, wait. The formula is C_p - C_v = (T V_m) (alpha^2) / beta_T.

Wait, but wait, V_m is molar volume, which is in m³/mol. So the units of the entire expression should be (K * m³/mol) * (1/K)^2 / (1/atm).

Wait, let me clarify the units:

T is in K.

V_m is m³/mol.

alpha is 1/K.

beta_T is 1/atm.

So:

T * V_m * (alpha)^2 / beta_T → ( K * m³/mol ) * (1/K^2) ) / (1/atm) )

Simplify: K cancels with 1/K^2 → 1/K.

And 1/(1/atm) is atm.

So units become (m³ * atm) / (mol * K).

Which is (m³·atm)/(mol·K).

But 1 m³·atm is 101325 J, so when we multiply by 101325, the units become J/(mol·K), which matches the unit for C_p - C_v.

So the calculation seems correct.

Wait, but let me recheck the numbers.

Let me go through the calculation again:

Compute each part step by step.

1. Compute V_m: molar volume.

Density rho = 992.2187 kg/m³.

Molar mass M = 0.01801528 kg/mol.

V_m = M / rho = 0.01801528 / 992.2187 = approx 1.816e-5 m³/mol.

2. Compute alpha squared.

alpha = 385.3e-6 K^-1 = 3.853e-4 K^-1.

alpha^2 = (3.853e-4)^2 = (3.853)^2 * 1e-8 = 14.847 * 1e-8 = 1.4847e-7 K^-2.

3. Compute T * V_m * alpha^2.

T = 313.15 K.

So,

313.15 * 1.816e-5 = 313.15 * 1.816e-5.

Let me compute that:

313.15 * 1.816e-5 = (313 * 1.816) * 1e-5 + (0.15 * 1.816)*1e-5.

313 * 1.816 ≈ let's compute 300*1.816=544.8, 13*1.816≈23.608, total ≈544.8+23.608=568.408.

0.15 *1.816≈0.2724.

So total is 568.408 + 0.2724 = 568.6804.

So 568.6804 *1e-5 = 5.686804e-3.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, 313.15 * 1.816e-5 is 313.15 * 0.00001816.

Wait, 313 times 0.00001816 is:

313 * 1.816e-5 = (300 +13) *1.816e-5.

300 *1.816e-5 = 0.05448.

13 *1.816e-5 = 0.00023608.

So total 0.05448 + 0.00023608 ≈ 0.05471608.

Wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought it was 568e-5, which is 0.00568. Hmm, I think I made a mistake in my earlier approach. Let me correct this.

Wait, no. Wait, 313.15 * 1.816e-5 = 313.15 * 1.816 * 1e-5.

313.15 * 1.816 → Let me compute that.

313 *1.8 = 563.4

313 *0.016 = 5.008

So 563.4 +5.008 = 568.408.

0.15 *1.816 ≈ 0.2724.

So total 568.408 +0.2724 = 568.6804.

Multiply by 1e-5: 568.6804e-5 = 0.005686804.

So T * V_m = 0.005686804 m³/(mol·K).

Wait, no, because T is in K, V_m is m³/mol. So T*V_m is K·m³/mol.

Wait, no, wait:

Wait, T is 313.15 K, V_m is 1.816e-5 m³/mol.

So T * V_m = 313.15 * 1.816e-5 m³/(mol).

Which is 313.15 * 1.816e-5 = 5.6868e-3 m³/(mol).

So that's 0.0056868 m³/mol.

Then multiply by alpha squared (1.4847e-7 K^-2):

0.0056868 m³/mol * 1.4847e-7 K^-2 = ?

Computing 0.0056868 * 1.4847e-7:

0.0056868 is 5.6868e-3.

So 5.6868e-3 * 1.4847e-7 = (5.6868 *1.4847 )e-10.

5.6868 * 1.4847 ≈ let's compute:

5 *1.4847 =7.4235

0.6868*1.4847≈ approx 1.020 (since 0.6 *1.48≈0.888, 0.08*1.48≈0.118, 0.0068*1.48≈0.01 → total around 1.016).

So total ≈7.4235 +1.016≈8.4395.

So 8.4395e-10 m³/(mol·K²).

Now, divide this by beta_T (4.482e-5 atm^-1):

8.4395e-10 / 4.482e-5 = (8.4395 /4.482 )e-5.

8.4395 /4.482 ≈ 1.883.

So 1.883e-5 (m³/(mol·K²)) * (atm).

Wait, no: 8.4395e-10 /4.482e-5 = (8.4395 /4.482) * 1e
