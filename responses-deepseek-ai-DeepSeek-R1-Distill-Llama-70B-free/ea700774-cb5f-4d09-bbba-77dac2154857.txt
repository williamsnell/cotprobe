Okay, so I've got this question about the share of electricity generated from fossil fuels in the United States as of 2019. I'm a bit rusty on my energy stats, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that fossil fuels are a big part of electricity generation, but I also know that there's been a shift towards renewables in recent years. Wait, but the question is about 2019, so I'm probably thinking before the latest trends.

I think the main fossil fuels used are coal, natural gas, and maybe some oil. From what I recall, natural gas has been increasing a lot, replacing coal to some extent. Coal was the dominant one for a long time but started declining. So maybe in 2019, natural gas was a significant portion.

I've heard that around 2016 or so, natural gas surpassed coal as the top source for electricity in the US. So by 2019, natural gas must have been a major part. Adding coal's contribution, which was still substantial but less than before, plus a bit from oil, which I think is a smaller percentage.

Wait, what about the exact percentages? I think the total for fossil fuels would be in the 60s or 70s. Let me think: natural gas maybe around 35-40%, coal around 20-25%, and oil maybe 1% or so. Adding those together, that would put fossil fuels at roughly 60% or so.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option G is 63%, H is 73%. I'm trying to remember if the total was closer to two-thirds or three-fourths. I think in 2019, the EIA (Energy Information Administration) reported that fossil fuels accounted for about 63% of US electricity generation. So that would make option G the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes I confuse the total with just one source. Let me double-check my memory. Yes, I think natural gas was about 35%, coal about 27%, and the rest from oil and other fossil fuels. So 35 + 27 is 62, and with a bit more from oil, it's around 63%. So G is 63%, which matches.

So the answer should be G.

As of 2019, fossil fuels accounted for approximately 63% of electricity generation in the United States. This includes contributions from natural gas, coal, and a small amount from oil. Natural gas was the leading source, surpassing coal in recent years, but both combined with oil made up the majority of the electricity mix. The closest option to this figure is 63%.
