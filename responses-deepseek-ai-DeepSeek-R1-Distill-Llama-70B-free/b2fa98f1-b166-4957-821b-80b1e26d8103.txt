Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

IfDNAaseis added to a bacterial cell, the DNA is hydrolyzed , the cell cannot make any more proteins and eventually dies. IfDNAaseis added to RNA viruses, they continue to produce new proteins. Explain.

Options:

A: The virus uses a special type of DNA that is resistant to DNAase.
B: The RNA virus is not affected by DNAase since it contains RNA, not DNA.
C: DNAase selectively degrades only bacterial DNA, not viral DNA.
D: The virus has a protective protein coat that prevents DNAase from reaching its genetic material.
E: DNAase triggers a dormant state in the virus, during which it does not need to produce proteins.
F: The virus is immune to DNAase
G: The virus contains both DNA and RNA
H: The virus encodes for a DNAase inhibitor that protects its genetic material.
I: The virus transforms DNAase into RNAase
J: The virus quickly repairs its DNA after DNAase damage.

Okay, so I've got this question about DNAase and how it affects bacterial cells versus RNA viruses. Hmm, I need to figure out why DNAase kills the bacteria but doesn't stop the viruses from making proteins.

Alright, let me start by recalling what DNAase does. DNAase is an enzyme that breaks down DNA. So when it's added to a bacterial cell, it must be hydrolyzing the DNA inside. Without DNA, the bacteria can't make proteins because DNA is necessary for transcription and translation. So the bacteria dies because it can't produce the proteins it needs to survive.

But then why do RNA viruses continue to produce proteins even when DNAase is added? RNA viruses, as I remember, have RNA as their genetic material, not DNA. So if the enzyme is DNAase, it specifically targets DNA. Since the virus doesn't have DNA, the DNAase shouldn't affect them. That makes sense.

Wait, but wait. Some viruses do have DNA. Oh, but the question is specifically about RNA viruses. So DNAase wouldn't do anything to their RNA. So the virus can continue using its RNA to make proteins because DNAase doesn't act on RNA.

Looking at the options:

Option B says the RNA virus isn't affected because it contains RNA, not DNA. That seems right. Because DNAase only breaks down DNA, so if the virus's genetic material is RNA, it's unaffected.

Other options don't fit. Option A says the virus has special DNA resistant to DNAase, but RNA viruses don't have DNA. Option C suggests DNAase only affects bacterial DNA, but that's not necessarily true; DNAase usually breaks any DNA it encounters, regardless of source. Option D talks about a protective coat, but if the virus's genetic material is RNA, the DNAase wouldn't target it anyway. Option F says the virus is immune, but that's not specific enough. Option H suggests an inhibitor, but again, if the virus uses RNA, it doesn't need to protect DNA because there's none.

So the correct answer must be B.

DNAase is an enzyme that specifically hydrolyzes DNA. When added to a bacterial cell, it degrades the cell's DNA, preventing protein synthesis and ultimately causing the cell's death. However, RNA viruses are unaffected by DNAase because their genetic material is RNA, not DNA. DNAase does not act on RNA, so these viruses can continue to produce proteins using their RNA. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. RNA viruses do not have DNA, so this does not apply.  
- **B**: Correct. RNA viruses are unaffected because they contain RNA, not DNA, and DNAase does not act on RNA.  
- **C**: Incorrect. DNAase degrades DNA regardless of its source, but RNA viruses lack DNA.  
- **D**: Incorrect. RNA viruses do not need a protective coat because their genetic material is RNA, which DNAase cannot degrade.  
- **F**: Incorrect. The term "immune" is vague and does not explain the specific reason RNA viruses are unaffected.  
- **H**: Incorrect. RNA viruses do not need to protect DNA because they lack it.  
- **I**: Incorrect. There is no evidence that RNA viruses transform DNAase into RNAase.  
- **J**: Incorrect. RNA viruses do not have DNA to repair.  

The correct explanation is that RNA viruses are unaffected by DNAase because they contain RNA, not DNA.
