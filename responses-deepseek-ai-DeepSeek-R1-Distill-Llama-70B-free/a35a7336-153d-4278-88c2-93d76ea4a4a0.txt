They were engaged to be married when they purchased an undeveloped parcel of land on a hillside overlooking the Pacific. The deed, which was properly executed and recorded, named the student and the boyfriend as grantees, "not as tenants in common but as joint tenants with right of survivorship. "Thereafter, the boyfriend, who was experiencing financial difficulties, offered to sell the property to his co-worker. Without the student's knowledge, the boyfriend executed a deed that purported to convey the hillside property to the co-worker in fee simple. The boyfriend signed his name and forged the student's name. He then delivered the deed of conveyance to the co-worker, who paid the boyfriend $150,000, which was the fair market value of the property. The co-worker immediately recorded the deed received from the boyfriend. The common law joint tenancy is unmodified by statute. Title to the property in question is now in

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this property law question. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand all the details.

So, there's a college student and her boyfriend living together. They bought a parcel of land. The deed says they're joint tenants with right of survivorship, not tenants in common. That's important because joint tenancy has that right of survivorship, meaning if one dies, the other gets the whole property.

Then, the boyfriend is having financial trouble and wants to sell the property. He offers it to his co-worker. Here's the kicker: he forges the student's name on the deed and sells it. He delivers the deed to the co-worker, who pays $150,000, which is the fair market value. Then, the co-worker records the deed immediately.

The question is about who owns the property now. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

So, let's break it down. Initially, the couple owns the property as joint tenants. So, each has an undivided half interest, but with the right that if one dies, the other takes the whole.

Now, the boyfriend tries to sell the property without the student's knowledge. He forges her name on the deed and sells it to the co-worker. The deed is delivered, and the co-worker pays and records it.

I remember that in joint tenancy, each joint tenant has the right to dispose of their own interest, but not the entire property. So, if one joint tenant sells their interest, the buyer becomes a tenant in common with the other joint tenant. But wait, in this case, the boyfriend is trying to convey the entire property, not just his interest.

So, the key issue here is whether the boyfriend can convey the entire property by forging the student's signature. The problem is about the validity of the deed when a joint tenant's signature is forged.

In real property law, a deed requires the signature of the person conveying the property. If someone forges a signature, the deed is invalid as to that person. But here, the boyfriend is a joint tenant. So, when he signs the deed, does that mean he's conveying his own interest, or is he trying to convey both his and the student's?

Wait, the deed he executed says he's conveying the property to the co-worker in fee simple, but he forged the student's name. So, the co-worker thinks he's buying the entire property, but in reality, only the boyfriend's interest is being transferred, right?

But wait, in joint tenancy, when one joint tenant mortgages or sells their interest, it severs the joint tenancy. So, if the boyfriend sells his interest, the co-worker would get his half, and the student's half remains, but now they'd be tenants in common. But in this case, the boyfriend is trying to sell the entire property, which he can't do alone.

But the problem arises because the boyfriend forged the student's signature. So, the student didn't actually convey her interest. So, the co-worker only gets the boyfriend's interest, but the student's remains. But wait, the deed was forged, so the student's interest wasn't actually transferred. So, from the co-worker's perspective, he might think he bought the whole property, but legally, he only got the boyfriend's half.

Wait, but the co-worker is a bona fide purchaser. He paid the fair market value and recorded immediately. So, does that protect him?

I think the recording part is important. If the co-worker is a BFP (bona fide purchaser) for value without notice of any defects, he might be protected. But in this case, the problem is that the boyfriend didn't have the authority to sell the student's interest. So, the co-worker can't get the student's half because the boyfriend couldn't convey it without her consent.

So, the result is that the co-worker gets the boyfriend's half, and the student still has her half. But since joint tenancy is about the four unities, when one joint tenant transfers their interest, it severs the joint tenancy, and the two become tenants in common.

Wait, but the original deed was joint tenants with right of survivorship. So, when the boyfriend sells his interest, the joint tenancy is severed, and the co-worker and the student become tenants in common.

But wait, in this case, the boyfriend tried to sell the entire property by forging the student's name. So, the co-worker thinks he bought 100%, but in reality, he only got the boyfriend's 50%, and the student still has her 50%. So, the co-worker and the student are now tenants in common.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: co-worker, student, and boyfriend as joint tenants. No, because the boyfriend sold his interest.

Option B: co-worker as fee simple. No, because the student's interest wasn't transferred.

Option C: boyfriend and student as joint tenants. No, because the boyfriend sold his interest, severing the joint tenancy.

Option D: co-worker and boyfriend as tenants in common. No, because the student still has her share.

Option E: co-worker and student as joint tenants. No, because joint tenancy was severed.

Option F: co-worker and boyfriend as joint tenants. No, same as above.

Option G: co-worker and student as tenants in common. Yes, this seems right.

Option H: all three as tenants in common. No, because the boyfriend sold his interest, so he's out.

Option I: boyfriend as owner. No, he sold it.

Option J: student as owner. No, because co-worker bought the boyfriend's half.

So, the answer should be G. But wait, let me double-check. Because the co-worker bought the boyfriend's interest, and the student's remains. So, they are tenants in common.

Wait, but in some jurisdictions, when a joint tenant sells their interest, the sale severs the joint tenancy, and the buyer and the remaining joint tenant become tenants in common. So, that would align with option G.

Alternatively, if the student's name was forged, the deed from her is invalid. So, the co-worker only gets the boyfriend's interest, making the co-worker and student tenants in common.

Yes, that makes sense. So, the correct answer is G.
</think>

The college student and her boyfriend originally owned the property as joint tenants with the right of survivorship. In joint tenancy, each party holds an undivided half interest, and the right of survivorship ensures that if one joint tenant dies, the other inherits the entire property. However, when one joint tenant sells their interest, the joint tenancy is severed, and the parties become tenants in common.

In this case, the boyfriend, facing financial difficulties, attempted to sell the entire property to his co-worker by forging the student's name on the deed. The co-worker paid $150,000 (the fair market value) and immediately recorded the deed. However, the forged signature means the student's interest was not legally transferred. As a result, the co-worker only acquired the boyfriend's interest in the property.

Since the joint tenancy was severed when the boyfriend sold his interest, the co-worker and the student now hold the property as tenants in common. Each owns an undivided 50% share of the property, but there is no longer a right of survivorship between them.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The boyfriend no longer has an interest in the property after selling it.
- **B**: Incorrect. The co-worker did not acquire the entire property because the student's interest was not transferred.
- **C**: Incorrect. The joint tenancy was severed when the boyfriend sold his interest.
- **D**: Incorrect. The student still retains her interest, so the co-worker and boyfriend are not tenants in common.
- **E**: Incorrect. The joint tenancy was severed, so the co-worker and student are not joint tenants.
- **F**: Incorrect. The boyfriend no longer has an interest in the property.
- **G**: Correct. The co-worker and student are now tenants in common, each owning an undivided 50% share.
- **H**: Incorrect. The boyfriend no longer has an interest in the property.
- **I**: Incorrect. The boyfriend sold his interest and no longer owns the property.
- **J**: Incorrect. The student's interest was not transferred, but she still shares ownership with the co-worker.

Thus, the correct answer is **G: the co-worker and the student as tenants in common.**

Answer: G
