Okay, so I've got this logic problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about translating the English statement "All robots are artifacts" into predicate logic. The options are from A to H, each with different logical expressions. Hmm, I remember that translating such statements involves using quantifiers and predicates correctly.

First, I'll break down the sentence. "All robots are artifacts" is a universal statement. In predicate logic, that usually means using a universal quantifier, which is the ∀ symbol. So the structure will be something like ∀x (something).

Now, the subject is "robots" and the predicate is "are artifacts." So I need to represent both as predicates. Let me assign variables here. Let's say R(x) stands for "x is a robot" and A(x) stands for "x is an artifact." So the sentence is saying that for every x, if x is a robot, then x is an artifact.

In logical terms, that's an implication. So for all x, R(x) implies A(x), which is written as R(x) → A(x). So putting it all together, it's ∀x (R(x) → A(x)).

Now, looking at the options, I need to find which one matches this structure. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A: (∀x)(Rx ⊂ Ax) - Wait, ⊂ is a subset symbol, which doesn't apply here because we're dealing with predicates, not sets. So this is probably incorrect.

Option B: (∀x)(Ax ⊃ Rx) - This reads as "For all x, if x is an artifact, then x is a robot." That's the opposite of what we want. Our original statement is robots are artifacts, not the other way around. So B is incorrect.

Option C: (∀x)(Ax ⊂ Rx) - Again, using ⊂, which is for sets, not predicates. So this is wrong.

Option D: (∀x)(Ax ∨ Rx) - This translates to "For all x, x is an artifact or x is a robot." But the original statement doesn't say anything about things being either artifacts or robots; it's specifically about robots being artifacts. So D doesn't capture the correct meaning.

Option E: (∀x)(Ax • Rx) - The • symbol usually represents conjunction, meaning "and." So this would mean "x is an artifact and x is a robot" for all x, which isn't what we want. The original statement doesn't say all things are both, just that all robots are artifacts.

Option F: (∀x)(Rx ⊃ Ax) - This looks like "For all x, if x is a robot, then x is an artifact." Yes, that's exactly what we're trying to express. So F seems correct.

Option G: (∀x)(Rx • Ax) - Again, using conjunction, which isn't right. So G is out.

Option H: (∀x)(Rx ∨ Ax) - Similar to D, this would mean "x is a robot or an artifact," which isn't the same as all robots being artifacts.

Wait, but let me double-check. The original statement is a universal affirmative, so it's ∀x (R(x) → A(x)), which matches option F. Yes, I think F is the right choice.

The statement "All robots are artifacts" is a universal affirmative, which translates into predicate logic using a universal quantifier and an implication. Let R(x) represent "x is a robot" and A(x) represent "x is an artifact." The correct logical form is ∀x (R(x) → A(x)), meaning "For all x, if x is a robot, then x is an artifact."

Analyzing the options:

- **A, C**: Use ⊂, which is incorrect because it denotes set inclusion, not logical implication.
- **B**: States ∀x (A(x) → R(x)), which reverses the original statement.
- **D, H**: Use ∨, which incorrectly suggests "x is a robot or an artifact," rather than the specific relationship that all robots are artifacts.
- **E, G**: Use •, which represents conjunction ("and"), incorrectly stating that all x are both robots and artifacts.
- **F**: Correctly states ∀x (R(x) → A(x)), matching the original statement.

Thus, the best translation is **F**.

Answer: F
