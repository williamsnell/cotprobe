Okay, so I've got this question about Guru Nanak and his age when he started preaching. I'm a bit rusty on Sikh history, but I'll try to think it through. 

Guru Nanak is the founder of Sikhism, right? I remember he's known as the first Sikh Guru. I think he lived in the 15th to 16th century. But the exact details about his life... hmm.

The question is asking how old he was when he began to preach the message of the divine Name. I recall that there's a significant event in his life where he had a spiritual experience. Wasn't it when he was around 30? Oh wait, maybe 38 or 39? Or perhaps 30? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, I think there's a story about him disappearing for three days and then coming back with his message. I believe that event happened when he was 30 years old. So he would have started preaching after that. So if he was 30 when that happened, that's when he began his mission.

Looking at the options, H is 30, which seems to fit. But wait, I'm not entirely sure. I remember reading that he was at the age of 38 or 39 when he started. Or was it 30? Maybe I'm mixing up the numbers.

Let me think again. Guru Nanak was born in 1469, I think. His enlightenment experience, known as the "udasi," happened when he was around 38 or 39. So he started preaching after that. But I'm not certain about the exact age.

Alternatively, some sources say he was 30 when he received his divine calling. So perhaps the correct answer is 30, which is option H.

Wait, another thought. The number 30 comes up a lot in religious figures' significant life events. Like Jesus starting his ministry at 30. Maybe Guru Nanak is similar. So I'm leaning towards 30, option H.

But I'm not 100% sure. I think I've heard both 30 and 38 as possible ages. Maybe I should go with the more commonly cited one. I think 30 is more widely accepted as the age when he started his mission.

The question asks how old Guru Nanak was when he started to preach the message of the divine Name. Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism, is believed to have had a significant spiritual experience, often referred to as his enlightenment, which marked the beginning of his preaching. 

While there are varying accounts regarding the exact age, a widely accepted tradition suggests that Guru Nanak was 30 years old when he began his mission. This aligns with the story of his disappearance for three days and his subsequent return with the message of the divine Name. Although some sources mention ages like 38 or 39, the age of 30 is more commonly cited and accepted in historical and religious contexts.

Thus, the correct answer is:

H: 30

Answer: H
