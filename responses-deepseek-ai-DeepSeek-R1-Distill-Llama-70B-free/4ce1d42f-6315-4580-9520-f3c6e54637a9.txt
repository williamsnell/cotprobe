Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the probability that a randomly selected integer from the set {1,2,3,...,100} is divisible by 2 but not by 3. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, probability is about favorable outcomes over total possible outcomes. The total here is 100 numbers, so denominator is 100. Now, the favorable cases are numbers divisible by 2 but not by 3.

First, let's find how many numbers between 1 and 100 are divisible by 2. Well, every second number is even, right? So that's 100 divided by 2, which is 50 numbers. So there are 50 numbers divisible by 2.

But wait, some of these might also be divisible by 3. I don't want those because the problem says 'not divisible by 3'. So I need to subtract the numbers that are divisible by both 2 and 3.

Hmm, numbers divisible by both 2 and 3 are the ones divisible by their least common multiple. The LCM of 2 and 3 is 6. So I should find how many numbers between 1 and 100 are divisible by 6.

Calculating that: 100 divided by 6. Let me see, 6*16=96. So there are 16 numbers divisible by 6. Wait, because 6*16=96 and 6*17=102, which is beyond 100. So yes, 16 numbers.

So the count of numbers divisible by 2 but not by 3 is 50 (divisible by 2) minus 16 (divisible by 6) = 34 numbers.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait a minute, 50 minus 16 is 34? Let me double-check that. 16 subtracted from 50 is indeed 34. So 34 favorable numbers.

But wait, wait again. Wait, 6 times 16 is 96, which is correct. So 16 numbers up to 96. So yes.

So the probability is 34 out of 100. Now, I need to simplify that fraction. 34/100 can be reduced. Both numerator and denominator are divisible by 2. 34 divided by 2 is 17, 100 divided by 2 is 50. So 17/50.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: Numbers divisible by 2 but not by 3. So, for each number from 1 to 100, check if it's even, and then check if it's not a multiple of 3.

Another way to calculate it is using inclusion-exclusion. The count is (number divisible by 2) minus (number divisible by both 2 and 3), which is exactly what I did before. So 50-16=34.

34/100 reduces to 17/50. So the probability is 17/50.

Looking at the options, option D is 17/50. So the answer should be D.

To determine the probability that a randomly selected integer from the set \(\{1, 2, 3, \ldots, 100\}\) is divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3, we proceed as follows:

1. **Total possible outcomes**: There are 100 integers in the set, so the denominator of the probability is 100.

2. **Count of numbers divisible by 2**: Every second number is even, so there are \( \frac{100}{2} = 50 \) numbers divisible by 2.

3. **Count of numbers divisible by both 2 and 3**: These numbers are divisible by the least common multiple of 2 and 3, which is 6. There are \( \left\lfloor \frac{100}{6} \right\rfloor = 16 \) such numbers.

4. **Count of numbers divisible by 2 but not by 3**: Subtract the count of numbers divisible by 6 from the count of numbers divisible by 2: \( 50 - 16 = 34 \).

5. **Probability**: The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes: \( \frac{34}{100} \). Simplifying this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 2 gives \( \frac{17}{50} \).

Thus, the probability that a randomly selected integer from the set is divisible by 2 and not divisible by 3 is \( \frac{17}{50} \).

The correct answer is **D**.
