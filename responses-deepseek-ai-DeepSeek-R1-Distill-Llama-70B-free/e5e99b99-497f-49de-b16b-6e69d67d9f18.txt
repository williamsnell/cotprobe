Okay, so I've got this problem here about a surveyor using a steel measuring tape. Hmm, I remember that materials expand when heated and contract when cooled. Oh right, thermal expansion! So the tape is exactly 50 meters at 20°C, and the surveyor is using it at 35°C. Wait, so the temperature is higher, so the tape should expand, making it longer than 50 meters, right?

The surveyor measures a distance and reads 35.794 meters off the tape. But wait, because the tape has expanded, each meter marking is actually a bit longer than it should be. So when she measures 35.794 meters, the actual distance is going to be a bit more than that because each of her tape's meters is longer. Or wait, no, maybe I'm getting this reversed.

Let me think. If the tape is longer, then when she lays it out, each meter mark is actually more than a true meter. So when she measures, say, 1 meter with this expanded tape, the actual distance is more than a meter. So in reality, the distance she's measuring with her expanded tape is longer than what she reads. So if the tape is longer, her reading under-reports the actual distance.

Wait, no, wait a second. Let me clarify. The steel tape at 20°C is 50.000 m. When it's hotter, 35°C, it expands. So the actual length of the tape is longer. So when she uses it to measure something, the "meter" on her tape is longer than a true meter. So when she measures 35.794 m, that's using her expanded tape. So each "meter" she's reading is longer than it should be. So the actual distance would be less than that, or more?

Wait, wait. Let's make it concrete. Suppose the tape is longer, so each "meter" is longer. So, say, if the true length is 50 m, but the tape is now 50.5 m at higher temp. So each meter mark on the tape is 1.01 m (approx). So when she measures something that's actually 50 m, the tape would show 50/1.01 ≈49.5049 m. So the reading is less than the actual distance. Oh wait, no, wait. If the tape is longer, then to measure a fixed distance, the number of meters shown on the tape would be less. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.

Let me think again. The actual distance being measured is, say, L. The tape has expanded, so each meter of the tape is longer. So when the surveyor uses this longer tape, she might think she's measuring, say, 35.794 m, but in reality, because each of her tape's meters is longer than a true meter, the actual distance is more than 35.794 m. No, wait, no. Because if each tape's meter is longer, then the number of meters she reads would be less. Wait, maybe I should model this with the expansion formula.

The formula for linear expansion is L = L0 * (1 + αΔT), where α is the coefficient of linear expansion for steel. I think steel's α is about 12e-6 per degree Celsius. So let's compute the expansion.

The initial length L0 is 50.000 m at 20°C. The temperature change ΔT is 35-20 =15°C. So the new length L = 50 * (1 + 12e-6 * 15). Let me calculate that.

12e-6 is 0.000012. Multiply by 15 gives 0.00018. So 1 + 0.00018 is 1.00018. So 50 * 1.00018 = 50.009 m. So the steel tape is now 50.009 meters long at 35°C.

Wait, but that can't be right. Wait, 15 * 12e-6 is 0.00018. So the expansion is 50 * 0.00018 = 0.009 m, so 9 mm. So the tape is 50.009 m long.

Now, the surveyor is using this longer tape. She measures a distance and reads 35.794 m. But each meter on this tape is longer than a true meter. So each meter she reads is (50.009 / 50) times longer than a true meter.

Wait, because the entire tape is longer. So the scale is expanded. So the true length L_true is equal to the reading multiplied by the expansion factor.

Wait, to think about it another way, when the tape is longer, each division (like each meter) is longer. So when she measures 35.794 m using the expanded tape, each meter she's counting is longer. So the actual distance (L) is more than 35.794 m.

Wait, no. Wait, if the tape is longer, then when she lays it out, the same number of divisions would cover a longer actual distance. Hmm, perhaps I should model it as the "apparent" length versus the real length.

Wait, let's see. If the tape's actual length is 50.009 m, but she thinks it's 50 m. So when she measures a distance, the number of meters she gets (the reading) is based on the expanded tape. Let me think about how her measurement translates to the true length.

Suppose the true distance is D. She uses her expanded tape to measure D, and the reading is R. How are D and R related?

The expanded tape's length is L = L0 (1 + αΔT) = 50.009 m.

So when she measures D, the number of divisions (R) she gets is D divided by the actual length per division on the tape. Because each division (meter) is longer now.

Wait, each meter division on the tape is now longer. So the number of divisions R is equal to D divided by (L0 (1 + αΔT) / N), where N is the number of divisions (so N=50 for 50 meters).

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the actual length per meter on the expanded tape. 

The original length per meter is 1 m. After expansion, each meter is 1 + αΔT meters.

So to get R, which is the reading, R = D / (1 + αΔT). Because each of her tape's meters is longer, so she'll read fewer meters for the same actual distance.

Wait, that makes sense. So if the real distance is D, then the reading R is D divided by the expansion factor. So D = R * (1 + αΔT).

Wait, let me check. If the tape is longer, then for a fixed D, R would be less than D, because each R-meter is longer. So D = R * (1 + αΔT) would make sense.

So in this case, R is 35.794 m.

So D = 35.794 * (1 + αΔT).

We already calculated that (1 + αΔT) is 1.00018.

So D = 35.794 * 1.00018.

Let me compute that. 35.794 * 1.00018.

Hmm, 35.794 * 1 is 35.794. 35.794 * 0.00018 is approximately 0.00644292. So adding them together, 35.794 + 0.00644292 ≈35.80044292 m.

Wait, but looking at the options, E is 35.8. But wait, maybe I made a mistake with the expansion factor. Let me recalculate.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the expansion more accurately. Let's go back.

The expansion of the steel tape: L = L0 (1 + αΔT).

L0 is 50.000 m.

α for steel is approximately 12e-6 /°C.

ΔT is 35-20=15°C.

So αΔT = 12e-6 *15 = 180e-6 = 0.00018.

So L =50 * 1.00018 =50.009 m.

That's correct.

Now, when the surveyor uses this tape, each meter mark is 1.00018 m long. So when she measures R meters, the actual distance D is R * 1.00018.

So D=35.794 *1.00018.

Calculating that:

35.794 * 1.00018 = ?

Let me compute step by step.

0.00018 * 35.794 = ?

35.794 *0.0001 =0.0035794

35.794 *0.00008 = approximately 0.00286352.

Adding them together: 0.0035794 +0.00286352 =0.00644292.

So total D=35.794 + 0.00644292 = 35.80044292 m.

So approximately 35.8004 m. Looking at the options, option E is 35.8, option G is 35.9, option F is 35.7.

Wait, but maybe I should think about this differently. Because the tape is calibrated at 20°C. So when the temperature increases, the tape expands, so each meter division is longer. So when she measures something, the number of divisions she reads will be less than the actual distance.

Wait, no, because each division is longer, so for an actual distance D, the number of divisions R is D / (1 + αΔT). Because each division is 1*(1+αΔT) meters.

Wait, earlier I thought D=R*(1+...), but now I'm confused. Let me think again.

If the true length is D, and the tape's divisions are longer, then R = D / (1 + αΔT).

So to get D, D = R * (1 + αΔT).

So in this case, R is 35.794 m. So D=35.794 *1.00018=35.80044 m, which is approximately 35.800 m.

Looking at the options, E is 35.8, which is close. So the answer would be E.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the expansion.

Wait, no, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me approach it from the perspective of the measurement.

The tape is 50.000 m at 20°C. At 35°C, it's 50.000 * (1 + 12e-6 *15) = 50.009 m.

So the actual length of the tape is longer. So when the surveyor measures a distance, she's using a tape that has each meter marking at longer intervals. So the distance she measures with the tape will be less than the actual distance, because each meter is longer.

Wait, no. Wait, if the tape is longer, then when she lays it out over a fixed distance, the number of meter marks would be fewer. Because each mark represents more length.

Wait, for example, suppose I have a 50m tape. It's now 50.009 m. So each meter (each mark) is 1.00018 m apart. So if I measure a distance of 50.000 m, I would only need 50.000 / 1.00018 ≈49.991 meters on the tape. So the reading would be about 49.991 m.

But in reality, the actual distance is 50 m, but the tape only reads 49.991 m because it's longer.

Wait, so when the actual distance is D, the reading R is R = D / (1 + αΔT).

So in the problem, she reads R =35.794 m. So the actual D is R * (1 + αΔT) = 35.794 *1.00018 ≈35.8004 m.

So the actual distance is approximately 35.8004 m. So the closest option is E:35.8.

Wait, but another way to think: the tape's scale is expanded, so when she uses it, the same number of units on the tape correspond to a larger actual distance.

So, in this case, she reads 35.794, but the actual distance is a bit longer. So 35.794 *1.00018 is approx 35.800.

Wait, but some of the options are a bit tricky. Let me recompute the exact value.

35.794 * (1 + 0.00018) = 35.794 + (35.794 *0.00018).

Calculate 35.794 *0.00018.

35.794 * 0.0001 = 0.0035794.

35.794 *0.00008 = 0.00286352.

Adding them: 0.0035794 +0.00286352=0.00644292.

Adding to 35.794: 35.794 +0.00644292=35.80044292 m.

So approximately 35.8004 m, which is 35.800 m when rounded to three decimal places.

Looking at the options, E is 35.8. So the correct answer is E.

Wait, but let me make sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is whether the expansion affects the measurement in the opposite way.

Wait, another approach: the measurement made by the surveyor is with the expanded tape. So, when she measures 35.794 m, she's assuming each meter is 1 m, but each meter is actually 1.00018 m. So the actual distance is 35.794 *1.00018 =35.8004 m.

Yes, that's the same conclusion as before. So the correct answer should be E:35.8 m.

To solve the problem, we need to account for the thermal expansion of the steel measuring tape. The tape is calibrated to be 50.000 m at 20°C, but at 35°C, it expands due to the temperature increase. The coefficient of linear expansion for steel is approximately \( \alpha = 12 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{°C}^{-1} \). The temperature change is \( \Delta T = 35 - 20 = 15 \, \text{°C} \).

Using the formula for linear expansion:

\[
L = L_0 (1 + \alpha \Delta T)
\]

where \( L_0 = 50.000 \, \text{m} \), we calculate the expanded length of the tape:

\[
L = 50.000 \times (1 + 12 \times 10^{-6} \times 15) = 50.000 \times 1.00018 = 50.009 \, \text{m}.
\]

This means the tape has expanded by \( 50.009 - 50.000 = 0.009 \, \text{m} \), or 9 mm. As a result, each meter marking on the tape is now slightly longer than a true meter. Specifically, each meter on the expanded tape corresponds to:

\[
\text{Actual length per meter on the tape} = 1 \times 1.00018 = 1.00018 \, \text{m}.
\]

The surveyor reads a distance of \( R = 35.794 \, \text{m} \) using the expanded tape. However, since each meter on the tape is longer, the actual distance \( D \) being measured is given by:

\[
D = R \times (1 + \alpha \Delta T).
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
D = 35.794 \times 1.00018.
\]

Breaking this calculation into parts:

\[
35.794 \times 1.00018 = 35.794 + (35.794 \times 0.00018).
\]

First, calculate \( 35.794 \times 0.00018 \):

\[
35.794 \times 0.0001 = 0.0035794, \quad 35.794 \times 0.00008 = 0.00286352.
\]

Adding these:

\[
0.0035794 + 0.00286352 = 0.00644292.
\]

Now, add this to \( 35.794 \):

\[
D = 35.794 + 0.00644292 = 35.80044292 \, \text{m}.
\]

Thus, the actual distance is approximately \( 35.800 \, \text{m} \). Comparing this to the options provided, the closest match is:

**E: 35.8**

This is the correct answer.
