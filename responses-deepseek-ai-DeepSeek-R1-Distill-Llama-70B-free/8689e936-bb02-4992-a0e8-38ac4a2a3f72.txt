Okay, so I've got this problem here about consumer surplus, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by recalling what consumer surplus is. From what I remember in economics, consumer surplus is the difference between what consumers are willing to pay and what they actually pay. It's like the area under the demand curve but above the price they paid, up to the quantity consumed.

The demand function given is p = 2000 - 0.1x - 0.01x². I need to find the consumer surplus when sales are at 100 units. So x is 100 here.

Wait, consumer surplus is calculated by integrating the demand function from 0 to x, and then subtracting the actual price paid times the quantity. So the formula should be the integral of p(x) dx from 0 to x, minus p(x) * x.

But wait, let me make sure. The demand function p is equal to the maximum price people are willing to pay for each unit. So when x is 100, the price per unit is p(100). Then, the total revenue would be p(100) multiplied by 100. But consumer surplus is the area under the curve minus that revenue.

So first, I should find p when x=100. Let's calculate that.

p = 2000 - 0.1*(100) - 0.01*(100)^2
Breaking that down:

0.1 * 100 is 10.
0.01 * 100^2 is 0.01 * 10000, which is 100.
So p = 2000 -10 -100 = 2000 -110 = 1890.

So the price when x=100 is $1890 per unit. Therefore, total revenue is 100 * 1890 = $189,000.

But I'm looking for consumer surplus, which is the integral from 0 to 100 of the demand function minus the revenue.

So let's set up the integral. The demand function is p(x) = 2000 -0.1x -0.01x².

The integral of p(x) dx from 0 to 100 is:

∫ (2000 - 0.1x -0.01x²) dx from 0 to 100.

Let me compute this integral step by step. The integral of 2000 dx is 2000x. The integral of -0.1x dx is -0.05x². The integral of -0.01x² dx is (-0.01/3)x³, which is -0.003333... x³.

So putting it all together, the integral evaluated from 0 to 100 is:

[2000*(100) ) - 0.05*(100)^2 - (0.01/3)*(100)^3] - [0 - 0 - 0] (since at 0 all terms are zero).

Calculating each term:

2000*100 = 200,000.

0.05*(100)^2 = 0.05 * 10,000 = 500.

(0.01/3)*100^3 = (0.01/3)*1,000,000 = (0.01 * 333,333.333) = approximately 3,333.333.

So plugging in:

200,000 - 500 - 3,333.333 = 200,000 - 3,833.333 = 196,166.666... approximately.

Wait, let me check that again. 200,000 minus 500 is 199,500. Then 199,500 minus 3,333.333 gives 196,166.666.

So the integral is $196,166.67.

But wait, the total revenue was 189,000. So consumer surplus is the integral minus the revenue: 196,166.67 - 189,000 = 7,166.67.

Looking at the options, option C is 7166.67 dollars. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check all the steps because I don't want to make a mistake. Let me recalculate the integral.

The integral of 2000 is 2000x, correct. At x=100, that's 200,000.

The integral of -0.1x is -0.05x². At x=100, that's -0.05 * 10,000 = -500.

The integral of -0.01x² is (-0.01/3)x^3. So that's (-0.01/3)*1,000,000 = (-0.01/3)*1e6 = (-1e4)/3 = approximately -3,333.333.

So adding them together: 200,000 -500 -3,333.333 = 196,166.667.

Subtracting the revenue (100*1890=189,000) gives 7,166.67, which is option C.

To calculate the consumer surplus when the sales level is 100, we use the demand function:

$$
p = 2000 - 0.1x - 0.01x^2
$$

Consumer surplus is the area under the demand curve (integral of \( p(x) \)) from \( x = 0 \) to \( x = 100 \), minus the total revenue (price per unit at \( x = 100 \) multiplied by 100).

1. **Find the price at \( x = 100 \):**
   \[
   p(100) = 2000 - 0.1(100) - 0.01(100)^2 = 2000 - 10 - 100 = 1890
   \]
   Total revenue is:
   \[
   \text{Revenue} = p(100) \cdot 100 = 1890 \cdot 100 = 189,000
   \]

2. **Compute the integral of \( p(x) \) from 0 to 100:**
   \[
   \int_0^{100} \left( 2000 - 0.1x - 0.01x^2 \right) dx
   \]
   Breaking it into terms:
   - \(\int 2000 \, dx = 2000x\)
   - \(\int -0.1x \, dx = -0.05x^2\)
   - \(\int -0.01x^2 \, dx = -\frac{0.01}{3}x^3\)

   Evaluate from 0 to 100:
   \[
   \left[ 2000x - 0.05x^2 - \frac{0.01}{3}x^3 \right]_0^{100}
   \]
   At \( x = 100 \):
   \[
   2000(100) - 0.05(100)^2 - \frac{0.01}{3}(100)^3 = 200,000 - 500 - 3,333.33 = 196,166.67
   \]

3. **Calculate consumer surplus:**
   \[
   \text{Consumer Surplus} = \text{Integral} - \text{Revenue} = 196,166.67 - 189,000 = 7,166.67
   \]

Thus, the consumer surplus is **7166.67**, which corresponds to option **C**.
