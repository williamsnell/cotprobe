Okay, let's try to figure this problem out. So, we have a function f(x) whose graph passes through the origin, which means that f(0) is 0, right? Because when x is 0, y is also 0. That’s a starting point.

The problem gives a recursive relation: for every integer n, f(2n) equals n squared plus f[2(n-1)]. Hmm, so f at an even number depends on f at the previous even number and n squared. Interesting.

We need to find f(8). Let's see how we can approach this. Maybe I can compute f(2), f(4), f(6), f(8) step by step using this recursion.

Let me note down what I know:

1. f(0) = 0 because the graph passes through the origin.

2. For any integer n, f(2n) = n² + f[2(n-1)].

Wait, so if I let m = 2n, then n = m/2. But maybe it's easier to just plug in values of n and compute each step.

Let's start with n=1:

f(2*1) = 1² + f[2(1-1)] → f(2) = 1 + f(0). Since f(0) is 0, f(2) = 1. Got it.

Now n=2:

f(2*2) = 2² + f[2(2-1)] → f(4) = 4 + f(2). We know f(2) is 1, so f(4) = 4 + 1 =5.

Next, n=3:

f(6) = 3² + f[4] → f(6)=9 +5=14.

n=4:

f(8)=4² + f[6] → f(8)=16 +14=30.

Wait, that seems straightforward. So f(8)=30. Looking at the options, option B is 30.

But let me double-check in case I made a mistake. Maybe I should compute more terms or see if there's a pattern.

Let me compute f(10) to see the pattern beyond.

n=5: f(10)=5² +f(8)=25+30=55.

So the sequence goes: f(0)=0, f(2)=1, f(4)=5, f(6)=14, f(8)=30, f(10)=55.

Looking at the differences between terms:

From f(0) to f(2): +1

f(2) to f(4): +4 (from 1 to5)

f(4) to f(6): +9 (5 to14 → difference 9)

f(6) to f(8): +16 (14 to30 → difference 16)

f(8) to f(10): +25 (30 to55 → difference25)

Wait, the differences are perfect squares: 1,4,9,16,25. Which are 1², 2², 3²,4²,5².

So each step, when n increases by 1, the function adds n squared. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's directly useful. But the recursive formula does add n² each time.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a closed-form formula for f(2n). Let's think about it.

The recursion is f(2n) = n² + f(2(n-1)).

This is a linear recurrence. Let's try expanding it for a few terms to see the pattern.

f(2n) = n² + f(2n-2)
f(2n-2) = (n-1)² + f(2n-4)
...
This continues down until f(0)=0.

So f(2n) = sum from k=1 to k=n of (k)^2.

Because each step adds k² where k starts at n and goes down.

Wait, let me think again. Because for f(2n), each step adds k², where k goes from 1 to n.

Wait, for example, when n=1, f(2)=1=1².

n=2: f(4)=1+4=5 → 1² +2².

n=3: f(6)=1+4+9=14 → sum from 1^2 to 3^2.

Wait, but earlier I had f(6)=14 which is 1+4+9=14, correct.

n=4: f(8)=1+4+9+16=30.

Yes! So f(2n) is the sum of squares from 1 to n.

So, f(8)= sum of squares 1^2 + 2^2 +3^2 +4^2 =1+4+9+16=30.

So the answer is 30, which is option B.

The function \( f(x) \) passes through the origin, meaning \( f(0) = 0 \). The problem provides the recursive relation \( f(2n) = n^2 + f[2(n-1)] \) for every integer \( n \). To find \( f(8) \), we compute \( f(2n) \) for increasing values of \( n \):

1. For \( n = 1 \):  
   \[
   f(2 \cdot 1) = 1^2 + f[2(1-1)] \implies f(2) = 1 + f(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.
   \]

2. For \( n = 2 \):  
   \[
   f(2 \cdot 2) = 2^2 + f[2(2-1)] \implies f(4) = 4 + f(2) = 4 + 1 = 5.
   \]

3. For \( n = 3 \):  
   \[
   f(2 \cdot 3) = 3^2 + f[2(3-1)] \implies f(6) = 9 + f(4) = 9 + 5 = 14.
   \]

4. For \( n = 4 \):  
   \[
   f(2 \cdot 4) = 4^2 + f[2(4-1)] \implies f(8) = 16 + f(6) = 16 + 14 = 30.
   \]

Thus, \( f(8) = 30 \). The pattern shows that \( f(2n) \) is the sum of squares of integers from 1 to \( n \). For \( n = 4 \), this sum is \( 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 = 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30 \).

The correct answer is **B: 30**.
