Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this history question about ancient Egypt. The question is asking about the population during the pharaoh's rule and what percentage were farmers. Hmm, I remember that in ancient civilizations, a large portion of the population worked in agriculture because it was the primary source of food and the economy wasn't as diversified as modern times.

Wait, how big was the population of ancient Egypt? I think it wasn't as huge as today. From what I recall, during the time of the pharaohs, maybe around 2-3 million people. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think. I remember reading something about the population being around 1-2 million during the Old Kingdom, but maybe it grew a bit more in later periods.

Now, the percentage of farmers. In many ancient societies, the majority were farmers. Like, maybe 80-90%? Because without modern technology, a lot of people were needed to work the land to produce enough food. So if the population was, say, around 2 million, and 90% were farmers, that would make sense.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option D says 2,500,000 population with 90% farmers. That fits with what I was thinking. Option J is 2 million and 60%, which seems a bit low for the percentage. Option B is 3 million and 75%, which is possible, but I think the population wasn't that high. Option E is 1.5 million and 70%, but I'm not sure if that's accurate.

Wait, another thought. I remember that in ancient Egypt, the Nile River was the lifeblood, and agriculture was very productive because of the annual floods. So they might have had a relatively high percentage of farmers. Maybe around 80-90% of the population. If the population was about 2.5 million, then 90% would be farmers. That matches option D.

But I'm a bit confused because some sources say the population might have been lower, around 1 million. But I think during the New Kingdom or later periods, it might have increased. So 2.5 million could be plausible for a later period.

So putting it together: the population was around 2.5 million, and 90% were farmers. So the answer should be option D.

The question asks about the population ruled by the pharaoh and the percentage of farmers. Considering ancient Egypt's reliance on agriculture, a large portion of the population would have been farmers, likely 80-90%. The population size during the pharaoh's rule is estimated to have been around 2-3 million, with some periods possibly reaching 2.5 million. Option D aligns with this reasoning, stating a population of 2,500,000 with 90% as farmers.

Answer: D
