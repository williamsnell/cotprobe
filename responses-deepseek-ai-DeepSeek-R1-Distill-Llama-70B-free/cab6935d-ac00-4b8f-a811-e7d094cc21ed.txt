Okay, so I've got this economics question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's see what it's about. The question says, "When disposable income increases by $X," and then gives several options about what happens to saving and consumption.

Hmm, I remember from my classes that disposable income is the income left after paying taxes and receiving transfers. So when disposable income goes up, people have more money to spend or save. But how does this exactly affect consumption and saving?

I think it's related to the concepts of marginal propensity to consume (MPC) and marginal propensity to save (MPS). The MPC is the portion of additional income that a household consumes rather than saves. So if someone's MPC is, say, 0.8, then for every extra dollar they earn, they spend 80 cents and save 20 cents.

Wait, but the question is about what happens when disposable income increases. So if income goes up by $X, consumption should increase by some amount, and the rest would be saved. But by how much exactly?

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. 

Option A: Saving remains constant. That doesn't make much sense because if income goes up, saving should change unless the MPC is zero, which isn't realistic. So probably not A.

Option B: Consumption decreases by more than $X. That would mean spending goes down a lot when income increases, which seems counterintuitive. Usually, higher income leads to more spending, not less. Unless it's a weird case, but I don't think this is the case here.

Option C: Saving increases by exactly $X. That would imply that all the extra income is saved, meaning MPC is zero. But that's not realistic. People usually spend a portion of it, so saving wouldn't increase by the full $X. So C is probably wrong.

Option D: Saving increases by less than $X. That makes sense because if part of the extra income is spent (based on MPC), then the saving can't be more than the extra income. Since some is spent, saving would be less than $X. So D is a possible candidate.

Option E: Consumption decreases by less than $X. Wait, if income increases, consumption shouldn't decrease, right? It should increase. So E might not be correct unless there's some specific scenario, but I don't think that's the case here.

Option F: Saving decreases by more than $X. That would mean people are actually dissaving, which would only happen if MPC is greater than 1, which isn't possible because MPC can't exceed 1. So F is out.

Option G: Consumption increases by exactly $X. That would mean MPC is 1, so all the extra income is spent. No saving occurs. That's possible, but it's only if MPC is 1, which is an edge case. The question doesn't specify any particular value for MPC, so assuming it's a general case, G might not be the correct answer.

Option H: Saving decreases by exactly $X. That would mean saving goes down by the same amount income went up, implying negative saving from the extra income. That doesn't make sense unless MPC is more than 1, which isn't possible. So H is wrong.

Option I: Consumption remains constant. That would mean spending doesn't change with income, which would require MPC to be zero. But that's not realistic for most people. So I is probably incorrect.

Option J: Consumption increases by more than $X. Again, that would require MPC over 1, which isn't possible. So J is out.

So after going through all the options, the ones that make sense are D and G. D says saving increases by less than $X, which aligns with the idea that some portion is saved and some is spent. G says consumption increases exactly by $X, which is only true if MPC is 1.

But the question doesn't specify that all income is consumed. Typically, the MPC is less than 1, so G wouldn't be generally correct. Therefore, the correct answer should be D.

When disposable income increases by $X, the relationship between consumption and saving is governed by the marginal propensity to consume (MPC). MPC determines the portion of additional income that is spent, with the remainder saved. If MPC is less than 1, which is typically the case, saving increases by less than $X because a portion of the additional income is spent.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. Saving does not remain constant; it changes as income changes.
- **B**: Incorrect. Consumption does not decrease when income increases; it typically increases.
- **C**: Incorrect. Saving does not increase by the full $X unless MPC is 0, which is unrealistic.
- **D**: Correct. Saving increases by less than $X because a portion of the additional income is spent.
- **E**: Incorrect. Consumption does not decrease; it increases with higher income.
- **F**: Incorrect. Saving cannot decrease by more than $X as MPC cannot exceed 1.
- **G**: Incorrect. Consumption increases by exactly $X only if MPC is 1, which is an edge case.
- **H**: Incorrect. Saving does not decrease by exactly $X unless MPC exceeds 1, which is impossible.
- **I**: Incorrect. Consumption does not remain constant; it typically increases with higher income.
- **J**: Incorrect. Consumption cannot increase by more than $X as MPC cannot exceed 1.

Thus, the correct answer is **D**, as it aligns with the realistic assumption that saving increases by less than $X when disposable income rises.

Answer: D
