Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the speed of a compressional wave in an iron rod. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question gives me the specific gravity of iron as 7.7 and Young's modulus as 27.5 × 10^6 lb/in². I remember that the speed of a compressional wave in a solid is related to Young's modulus and the density of the material.

Wait, the formula I think is v = sqrt(Y / ρ), where Y is Young's modulus and ρ is the density. Right, that makes sense because the stiffer the material (higher Y) and the less dense it is (lower ρ), the faster the wave should travel.

But wait, the specific gravity is given instead of density. Oh right, specific gravity (SG) is the ratio of the density of the substance to the density of water. So SG = ρ_iron / ρ_water. Since ρ_water is 1000 kg/m³ or something like that. Oh wait, but I need to make sure about the units here because the Young's modulus is given in lb/in², which are imperial units. Ugh, unit conversions can be tricky.

Let me jot down what I know. Specific gravity of iron is 7.7. So the density of iron is 7.7 times that of water. Water's density is about 62.4 lb/ft³, right? Because I remember that water weighs 62.4 pounds per cubic foot. So ρ_iron = 7.7 * 62.4 lb/ft³. Let me calculate that.

7.7 * 62.4 = Let's see, 7 * 62.4 is 436.8, and 0.7 * 62.4 is 43.68. So 436.8 + 43.68 = 480.48 lb/ft³. So ρ is 480.48 lb/ft³.

Now, Young's modulus Y is 27.5e6 lb/in². But wait, the units for Y and density need to be compatible. Because the formula for wave speed uses consistent units. Let me check the units.

In the formula v = sqrt(Y/ρ), the units of Y are in force per area (like Pa or psi), and ρ is mass per volume. So the units for v would be sqrt( (force/area) / (mass/volume) ) = sqrt( (force * volume) / (area * mass) ) ). Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe better to convert all units to a consistent system.

Since Y is given in lb/in² and density in lb/ft³, perhaps I should convert Y to lb/ft². Because 1 ft is 12 inches, so 1 ft² is 144 in². So 1 lb/in² is 144 lb/ft². So Y in lb/ft² is 27.5e6 lb/in² * 144 lb/ft² per lb/in².

Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again. If Y is 27.5e6 lb per square inch, then to get lb per square foot, since 1 square foot is 144 square inches, I multiply by 144.

So Y = 27.5e6 lb/in² * 144 in²/ft² = 27.5e6 * 144 lb/ft².

Let me calculate that. 27.5e6 is 27,500,000. Multiply by 144:

27,500,000 * 144 = Let's break it down.

27,500,000 * 100 = 2,750,000,000

27,500,000 * 44 = ?

Wait, 27.5e6 * 40 = 1,100,000,000 (because 27.5e6 *4=110e6, times 10 is 1.1e9).

27.5e6 *4 = 110e6, so 27.5e6 *44 = 27.5e6*(40+4) = 1.1e9 + 110e6 = 1.21e9.

So 27.5e6 *144 = 2.75e9 + 1.21e9 = 3.96e9 lb/ft².

Wait, wait, wait, let me double-check that calculation. Alternatively, 27.5 *144 = let's compute 27*144 + 0.5*144.

27 * 144: 20*144=2880, 7*144=1008 → 2880+1008=3888.

0.5 *144=72. So total 3888+72=3960.

So 27.5e6 lb/in² * 144 in²/ft² = 3960e6 lb/ft² → 3.96e9 lb/ft².

Okay, so Y is 3.96e9 lb/ft².

Density ρ is 480.48 lb/ft³.

Wait, but wait. The formula is v = sqrt(Y / ρ). So Y has units of lb/ft² and ρ is lb/ft³.

Wait, Y is lb per square foot (lb/ft²), and ρ is lb per cubic foot (lb/ft³). So when I do Y/ρ, the units would be (lb/ft²) / (lb/ft³) ) = ft. So the square root of ft would be in sqrt(ft), which doesn't make sense for velocity. Hmm, I must have messed up the units somewhere.

Wait no, that can't be right. Oh wait, Y is in lb per square inch, but I converted it to lb per square foot, but perhaps I should have kept it in the same system. Maybe I should convert everything to a consistent unit system, like using SI units instead.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use the metric system. Let me think about that.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the units in the formula. Since in the formula, Y is in Pa (which is kg/(m·s²)) and density is kg/m³.

So Y has units of kg/(m·s²), density kg/m³, so Y/ρ is (kg/(m·s²)) / (kg/m³) ) = m²/s². So the square root is m/s, which is correct.

So perhaps I should convert the given values into SI units.

Let me try that approach.

Young's modulus Y = 27.5e6 lb/in². Let's convert that to Pascals.

I know that 1 lb/in² is approximately 6894.76 Pascals. So 27.5e6 lb/in² * 6894.76 Pa per lb/in².

Calculate that:

27.5e6 * 6894.76 = ?

Let me compute 27.5 * 6894.76 first.

27 * 6894.76 = 186,168.52,

0.5 *6894.76=3,447.38,

Total: 186,168.52 +3,447.38 = 189,615.9.

So 27.5 * 6894.76 = 189,615.9.

Multiply by 1e6: 189,615.9e6 Pa = 1.896159e11 Pa.

Wait, that seems way too high. Or is that correct? Let me check.

Wait, 1 lb/in² ≈ 6.89476e3 Pa, so 27.5e6 lb/in² = 27.5e6 * 6.89476e3 Pa = 27.5 *6.89476e9 = ?

27.5 *6.89476 = ?

Let me compute 27 *6.89476 = 186.168, 0.5*6.89476=3.44738, so total 189.615, so 189.615e9 Pa = 1.89615e11 Pa.

So Y = 1.89615e11 Pa.

Density: specific gravity is 7.7. Water's density is 1000 kg/m³, so iron's density is 7.7 * 1000 = 7700 kg/m³.

Now, v = sqrt(Y/ρ) = sqrt( (1.89615e11) / 7700 )

Compute the division: 1.89615e11 / 7700 = approx ?

Let me compute 1.89615e11 / 7.7e3 = (1.89615 / 7.7 )e(11-3) → (approx 0.2463) * 1e8 → 2.463e7.

So sqrt(2.463e7) = sqrt(2.463e7) m/s.

Wait, sqrt(2.463e7) = sqrt(24630000) → Let's see, 5000^2 is 25,000,000, which is 2.5e7. So sqrt(2.46e7) is a bit less than 5000 m/s. Let me compute it more accurately.

Approximate calculation: 4960^2 = ?

5000^2=25,000,000.

4960 = 5000-40.

(5000-40)^2 = 5000² - 2*5000*40 +40² → 25,000,000 - 400,000 + 1,600 = 24,601,600.

So 4960^2=24,601,600 → which is 2.46016e7. Our Y/rho is 2.463e7, which is a bit higher.

So the square root would be just a little over 4960 m/s. Let's compute 4960 + (2.463e7 -2.46016e7)/(2*4960) → using linear approximation.

Difference in Y/rho: (2.463e7 -2.46016e7)= 2840.

So delta_v ≈ 2840 / (2 *4960) )= 2840/(9920) ≈ 0.2865 m/s.

So v≈4960.2865 m/s. Approximately 4960 m/s.

But wait, the options are in ft/sec. So I need to convert this to ft/s.

I know that 1 m ≈ 3.28084 ft. So multiply by that.

4960 m/s * 3.28084 ft/m → Let's compute that.

4960 *3.28084.

Hmm, 5000 *3.28084 =16,404.2 ft/s.

But 4960 is 40 less than 5000.

40 *3.28084=131.2336.

So 16,404.2 -131.2336 = 16,272.9664 ft/s.

Wait, that's about 1.627e4 ft/s. So approximately 1.63 ×10^4 ft/s.

Looking at the options, let's see: option E is 1.6e4, option G is 1.4e4, option H is 2.0e4.

Wait, but wait a second. Maybe I made a mistake in the unit conversions earlier. Because when I converted Y to Pa, I got a really high value, leading to a high speed, but the options are more around 1.6e4 to 2.4e4 ft/s.

Wait, wait, 16,273 ft/s is about 1.627e4 ft/s, which is close to option E: 1.6e4. But let me double-check my calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the approach. Let me think again. Another approach: instead of converting to SI units, work in imperial units.

In imperial units, Y is 27.5e6 lb/in², and density is 480.48 lb/ft³.

But the formula for wave speed is v = sqrt( Y * (1/(density)) * conversion factor ), because the units might not directly cancel. Hmm, that might be more complicated.

Wait, another approach: use the formula in imperial units. Let me recall that in imperial units, the speed in ft/s can be calculated with Y in psi (lb/in²) and density in lb/ft³.

Wait, I think there's a formula that uses the modulus and density with specific conversions. Let me look it up in my mind.

I remember that in imperial units, the speed of sound v in ft/s is given by v = sqrt( (Y * 144) / (density * 32.174) ) ).

Wait, why 144 and 32.174? Hmm, because 144 square inches in a square foot, and 32.174 lb·ft/lbf·s² is the conversion factor for lb to mass ( slug is lb·s²/ft).

Wait, perhaps the formula is v = sqrt( (Y * 144 ) / (density * 32.174) ) )

Alternatively, the general formula is v = sqrt( Y / (density * conversion factor) ), where the conversion factor accounts for unit consistency.

Let me think about the units again. Y is in lb/in². So, to get Y in lb/ft², multiply by 144. So Y_ft² = Y_in² * 144.

Density is in lb/ft³.

So Y_ft² is lb/ft².

So Y_ft² / density = (lb/ft²) / (lb/ft³) ) = ft.

So the square root of ft is sqrt(ft), which isn't the unit for velocity. So I'm missing something here.

Ah, because in the imperial system, mass isn't directly in pounds; we use slugs. The density in lb/ft³ is actually mass density (lb-mass per ft³), but in imperial mechanics, F=ma uses pounds-force, so we need to convert mass to slugs.

The conversion factor is that 32.174 lb·ft/lbf·s² is the acceleration due to gravity, which relates mass in slugs to force in lbf.

So the correct formula should account for this. Let's see:

The formula in imperial units is v = sqrt( (Y * 144) / (density * 32.174) ) )

Because Y is in psi (lb/in²), so multiplying by 144 converts it to lb/ft².

Density is in lb/ft³, but we need to convert it to slugs/ft³ by dividing by 32.174 (since 1 slug = 32.174 lb·s²/ft).

So putting it together:

v = sqrt( (Y * 144) / (density / (32.174)) ) )

Wait, no, density is in lb/ft³, which is mass per volume. So to get it into slugs per ft³, we have to divide by 32.174 lb·s²/ft. So density in slugs/ft³ is (density_lb_ft3) / (32.174).

So the formula would be:

v = sqrt( (Y * 144) / (density / 32.174) ) )

= sqrt( (Y * 144 * 32.174) / density )

So plug in the numbers:

Y =27.5e6 lb/in²,

density = 480.48 lb/ft³.

So v = sqrt( (27.5e6 * 144 * 32.174) / 480.48 )

Let me compute that step by step.

First, compute numerator: 27.5e6 *144 *32.174.

Compute 27.5e6 *144 first.

27.5e6 *144 = 27.5 *1e6 *144 = 27.5 *144 = 3960 → 3960e6 = 3.96e9.

Then multiply by 32.174: 3.96e9 *32.174.

Let me compute that.

3.96e9 *32.174 = 3.96 *32.174e9.

3.96 *32.174: 3 *32.174 =96.522, 0.96 *32.174=30.827, so total 96.522 + 30.827 = 127.349.

So 127.349e9 = 1.27349e11.

So numerator is 1.27349e11.

Denominator is 480.48.

So v² = 1.27349e11 / 480.48 ≈ 2.65e8.

Wait, let me compute 1.27349e11 /480.48:

Divide 1.27349e11 by 480.48.

480.48 is approximately 4.8048e2.

So 1.27349e11 /4.8048e2 = (1.27349 /4.8048) * 1e9.

1.27349 /4.8048 ≈ 0.265.

So 0.265 *1e9 = 2.65e8.

So v² ≈2.65e8 → v= sqrt(2.65e8 ) ft/s.

What's sqrt(2.65e8)?

Well, sqrt(2.65e8) = sqrt(2.65)*1e4.

sqrt(2.65) is approximately 1.628.

So 1.628e4 ft/s → about 1.63 ×10^4 ft/s.

Looking back at the options, option E is 1.6e4 ft/s, which is 16,000 ft/s. My calculation gives approximately 16,300, which is close to 1.6e4. But perhaps I should check for any calculation errors.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation steps.

Compute Y *144 *32.174 / density.

Y=27.5e6 → 27,500,000 lb/in².

Multiply by 144: 27,500,000 *144 = 3,960,000,000 lb/ft².

Multiply by 32.174: 3,960,000,000 *32.174 = ?

3,960,000,000 *32 =126,720,000,000,

3,960,000,000 *0.174=?

0.1 *3,960,000,000 =396,000,000,

0.07 *3,960,000,000=277,200,000,

0.004 *3,960,000,000=15,840,000.

So 0.174 → 396e6 +277.2e6 +15.84e6 = (396+277.2+15.84) e6 = 689.04e6.

Wait, wait, 396 +277.2 = 673.2 +15.84=689.04.

So 689.04e6.

So
