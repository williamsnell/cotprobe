Okay, I need to figure out the main difference between Hobbes and Locke regarding their political philosophies. I remember that both of them talked about the social contract, but their views were quite different.

Hobbes, if I recall correctly, believed that life before the social contract was very harsh. He described it as "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short." People were in a state of war with each other, and there was no authority to keep order. So, to escape this chaos, people agreed to a social contract where they gave up their rights to a strong central authority, like a monarch, to maintain order and protect them. So Hobbes' state of nature was pretty negative.

Locke, on the other hand, had a more optimistic view of human nature. He thought that in the state of nature, people were generally peaceful and rational. They had inherent rights to life, liberty, and property. The main problem wasn't each other but the lack of a common authority to resolve disputes. So, when people enter into a social contract, they create a government to protect these natural rights, not to escape from a war-like situation. Locke's government was more about protection and trust, and he even allowed for the possibility of revolt if the government failed to uphold its part of the contract.

So the question is asking for the principal difference between their positions. The options are about different aspects: courts, law, contractual obligations, and their account of life before the social contract.

Option A is about courts maintaining order. I don't think that's the main point because both might agree on the role of courts, but maybe not. Not sure. Option B is about the role of law. Again, both have laws in their systems, but maybe the extent differs. Option C is about contractual obligations. Well, both use the idea of a social contract, but their views on what that contract entails differ. Like, Hobbes is more about absolute authority, while Locke allows for more rights and even revolution.

Option D is about their account of life before the social contract. That seems to fit because Hobbes saw it as a war of all against all, whereas Locke saw it as more harmonious with natural rights. So their main difference is in what life was like before the contract.

Wait, but the question is about the principal difference between their positions. So, it's not just about the state of nature, but maybe more about the purpose of the government. But the question is about which statement is closest to characterizing the principal difference.

Looking at the options again, D says they differ in their account of life before the social contract. That seems accurate because their differing views on the state of nature lead to their different conclusions about government. So the main difference starts with their views on the state of nature.

Therefore, the answer should be D.

The principal difference between Hobbes and Locke lies in their accounts of life before the social contract. Hobbes depicted the state of nature as a chaotic and violent condition, necessitating the surrender of individual rights to a strong authority. In contrast, Locke viewed the state of nature as peaceful, with individuals possessing natural rights that a government should protect. Their differing views on the state of nature shaped their distinct approaches to governance and the social contract.

Answer: D
