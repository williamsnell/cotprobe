Okay, so I have this problem about Paul and his lunch choices. He likes Twinkies and soda, and his utility is given by the square root of the product of t and s, where t is the number of Twinkies and s is the number of sodas. His mom gives him $1, and each Twinkie costs $0.10, while each soda costs $0.25. I need to figure out how many Twinkies he should buy to maximize his utility.

Hmm, right. So the utility function is U(t,s) = sqrt(ts). I remember from my economics class that to maximize utility given a budget constraint, we usually look at the marginal utilities and the prices to find the optimal bundle.

First, I think I should write down the budget constraint. Paul has $1, so the cost of Twinkies plus the cost of sodas can't exceed that. So 0.10t + 0.25s ≤ 1. But since we're looking for the optimal point, we'll assume he spends the whole dollar, so 0.10t + 0.25s = 1.

I remember that the utility maximization involves setting the ratio of marginal utilities equal to the ratio of the prices. So I'll need to find the marginal utilities of t and s.

The utility function is U = sqrt(ts) = (ts)^0.5. To find the marginal utilities, I'll take the partial derivatives with respect to t and s.

Let's compute MU_t first. The partial derivative of U with respect to t is:

MU_t = dU/dt = 0.5 * (ts)^(-0.5) * s = s / (2*sqrt(ts)).

Similarly, the partial derivative with respect to s is:

MU_s = dU/ds = 0.5 * (ts)^(-0.5) * t = t / (2*sqrt(ts)).

Wait, but sqrt(ts) is the same as (ts)^(1/2), so sqrt(ts) in the denominator would be (ts)^(1/2), so 1 over that is (ts)^(-1/2). So when I multiply by s, I get s*(ts)^(-1/2) * 0.5.

Wait, maybe I should simplify the expressions. Let's see:

MU_t = (0.5) * s / (sqrt(t)*sqrt(s)) ) = 0.5 * sqrt(s/t).

Similarly, MU_s = (0.5) * t / (sqrt(t)*sqrt(s)) ) = 0.5 * sqrt(t/s).

Wait, maybe another approach. Let me think: sqrt(ts) is t^(0.5)s^(0.5). So taking the derivative with respect to t, we get 0.5 t^(-0.5) s^(0.5). Which would be equal to (s^(0.5))/(2 t^(0.5)) ) = sqrt(s)/(2 sqrt(t)).

Similarly, the marginal utility for s would be sqrt(t)/(2 sqrt(s)).

So the ratio of MU_t to MU_s would be [sqrt(s)/(2 sqrt(t))] / [sqrt(t)/(2 sqrt(s))] ].

Simplify that: the 2s cancel out, so it's (sqrt(s) / sqrt(t)) ) / (sqrt(t)/sqrt(s)) ) = (s/t) / (t/s) ) = (s^2)/(t^2).

Wait, no, let me compute that again. The ratio is [sqrt(s)/(2 sqrt(t))] divided by [sqrt(t)/(2 sqrt(s)))].

So that's [sqrt(s)/(2 sqrt(t))] * [2 sqrt(s)/sqrt(t)].

The 2s cancel, so we have (sqrt(s) * sqrt(s)) / (sqrt(t) * sqrt(t)) ) = s/t.

So the ratio of MU_t to MU_s is s/t.

Now, the condition for utility maximization is that the ratio of marginal utilities should equal the ratio of prices. So:

MU_t / MU_s = (price of t) / (price of s).

Wait, wait. No, the correct condition is that the ratio of the marginal utilities equals the ratio of the prices. So:

MU_t / MU_s = (Pt) / (Ps).

Where Pt is the price of Twinkies and Ps is the price of soda.

So Pt is $0.10, Ps is $0.25.

So:

MU_t / MU_s = 0.10 / 0.25 = 2/5.

But earlier, we found that MU_t / MU_s = s/t.

So setting s/t = 2/5.

Which implies that s = (2/5) t.

That's the optimal condition. So s = (2/5) t.

Now, plug this into the budget constraint equation.

The budget constraint is 0.10 t + 0.25 s = 1.

Substituting s with (2/5)t:

0.10 t + 0.25*(2/5 t) = 1.

Let me compute that.

First, compute 0.25*(2/5) = (0.25)*(0.4) = 0.10.

So 0.10 t + 0.10 t = 1.

Adding them gives 0.20 t = 1.

So t = 1 / 0.20 = 5.

Wait, but 0.20 t =1 → t=5. So he should buy 5 Twinkies.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the calculations.

The budget constraint substitution:

s = (2/5)t.

So 0.10 t + 0.25*(2/5 t) = ?

Compute 0.25*(2/5): 0.25 is 1/4, 2/5 is 0.4. 1/4 * 2/5 = 2/20 = 1/10 = 0.1.

So 0.10 t + 0.1 t = 0.2 t = 1 → t = 5.

So t=5. So the number of Twinkies is 5.

Looking at the options, option G is 5.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the condition.

Wait, in the condition, I have MU_t / MU_s = Pt / Ps.

So MU_t / MU_s = 0.10 / 0.25 = 0.4.

Earlier, I found that MU_t / MU_s = s/t.

So s/t = 0.4 → s = 0.4 t.

Wait wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because 0.10/0.25 is 0.4, which is 2/5. So s/t = 0.4, so s = 0.4 t.

Wait, but when I did the substitution, I used 0.25*(2/5 t), which is 0.1 t. Let me see.

Wait, 0.25 is the price of soda, and s is (2/5) t. So 0.25 * (2/5 t) = 0.10 t. So yes, that's correct.

Wait, let me compute 0.25*(2/5) again.

2/5 is 0.4, so 0.25 * 0.4 is 0.10. So that's correct.

So when I add 0.10 t + 0.10 t, I get 0.20 t =1 → t=5.

So that's 5 Twinkies. So the answer would be G:5.

But wait, let me think again. Because sometimes when dealing with square roots, it's possible to make a mistake in the derivatives.

Alternatively, maybe I can use another approach. Since the utility function is Cobb-Douglas, I can use the formula for optimal bundles.

In a Cobb-Douglas utility function U = t^a s^b, the optimal condition is (a/(a+b)) * income for t, and (b/(a+b)) * income for s.

Wait, in this case, the utility function is sqrt(t s) = t^(0.5) s^(0.5). So a=0.5, b=0.5.

So the ratio a/(a+b) would be 0.5/(0.5+0.5) = 0.5. So each good gets half the income.

Wait, but that can't be right because the prices are different. Oh wait, no, the formula is that the expenditure on each good is (a/(a+b)) * income divided by the price.

Wait, perhaps another approach.

The general formula for optimal t and s in a Cobb-Douglas function is:

t = (a/(a + b)) * (I / Pt)

s = (b/(a + b)) * (I / Ps)

Wait, no, I think that's not correct. Alternatively, the ratio of expenditures would be a:b.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the expenditure shares. The expenditure on each good is proportional to their exponents divided by the sum of exponents.

Wait, for U = t^a s^b, the optimal expenditure on t is (a/(a + b)) * I, and similarly for s.

Wait, but I think the correct approach is that the ratio of the marginal utilities equals the price ratio.

Alternatively, perhaps the optimal t and s can be found by:

t = (a * I) / (Pt * (a + b))

s = (b * I) / (Ps * (a + b))

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try using the Cobb-Douglas approach.

In the utility function U = t^0.5 s^0.5, the exponents a and b are both 0.5.

The formula for optimal quantities is:

t = (a / (a + b)) * (I / Pt)

s = (b / (a + b)) * (I / Ps)

Wait, because the marginal utilities relate to the exponents.

So a + b = 1.0.

Thus, t = (0.5 / 1) * (1 / 0.10) = 0.5 * 10 = 5.

Similarly, s = (0.5 /1 ) * (1 / 0.25) = 0.5 *4 = 2.

So t=5 and s=2.

Which gives the same result as before. So with t=5, that's option G.

So yeah, that confirms it. So the answer is G:5.

To determine how many Twinkies Paul should buy to maximize his utility, we start with the utility function:

\[
U(t, s) = \sqrt{ts}
\]

where \( t \) is the number of Twinkies and \( s \) is the number of sodas. The budget constraint is:

\[
0.10t + 0.25s \leq 1
\]

To maximize utility, the ratio of marginal utilities must equal the ratio of prices. The marginal utilities are:

\[
MU_t = \frac{\partial U}{\partial t} = \frac{s}{2\sqrt{ts}}, \quad MU_s = \frac{\partial U}{\partial s} = \frac{t}{2\sqrt{ts}}
\]

The ratio of marginal utilities is:

\[
\frac{MU_t}{MU_s} = \frac{s}{t}
\]

Setting this equal to the price ratio:

\[
\frac{MU_t}{MU_s} = \frac{P_t}{P_s} \implies \frac{s}{t} = \frac{0.10}{0.25} = 0.4
\]

Thus, \( s = 0.4t \). Substituting \( s = 0.4t \) into the budget constraint:

\[
0.10t + 0.25(0.4t) = 1
\]

Simplify:

\[
0.10t + 0.10t = 1 \implies 0.20t = 1 \implies t = 5
\]

Therefore, Paul should buy 5 Twinkies to maximize his utility. This corresponds to option **G**.
