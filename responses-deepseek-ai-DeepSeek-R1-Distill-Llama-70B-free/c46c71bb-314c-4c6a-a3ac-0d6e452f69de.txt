Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a spring being stretched and calculating the work done. Hmm, I remember that when you stretch or compress a spring, you're dealing with elastic potential energy. Oh right, the work done is related to the potential energy stored in the spring.

Let me read the problem again. So, a force of 30 N is required to maintain the spring stretched from 12 cm to 15 cm. Wait, the natural length is 12 cm, and it's stretched to 15 cm. That means the extension is 3 cm, right? Or wait, 15 minus 12 is 3 cm. But wait, I should probably convert that to meters because the standard unit for force is Newtons and length is meters in the metric system.

So, 3 cm is 0.03 meters. Now, I think Hooke's Law applies here, which is F = kx, where F is force, k is the spring constant, and x is the displacement from the natural length.

So, they said F is 30 N when x is 0.03 m. So I can find k, the spring constant. Let me calculate that. Rearranging Hooke's Law, k = F/x. So F is 30 N, x is 0.03 m. So k = 30 / 0.03. Let me compute that. 30 divided by 0.03 is the same as 30 multiplied by (100/3), which is 1000/3. 30*100 is 3000, divided by 3 is 1000. So k is 1000 N/m. Wait, that seems a bit high, but I think it's correct.

Now, the question is asking for the work done in stretching the spring from 12 cm to 20 cm. So the initial length is 12 cm, which is the natural length, so x_initial is 0. The final length is 20 cm, so that's 8 cm beyond the natural length. So that's 0.08 meters displacement.

Wait, no. Wait, the spring is stretched from 12 cm to 20 cm, so the extension is 8 cm, which is 0.08 m.

But wait, I thought the initial point is the natural length, so x_i is 0, and x_f is 0.08 m. So the work done is the integral of F from x_i to x_f. But since F is kx, the work done is (1/2)k x_f squared, because the integral of kx dx from 0 to x_f is (1/2)k x^2.

Wait, but wait! The problem says that a force of 30 N is needed to stretch it from 12 cm to 15 cm. So that gives us k. Then, to find the work done from 12 cm (natural length) to 20 cm, which is 8 cm extension.

But wait, when the spring is stretched beyond its natural length, the force increases as per Hooke's Law, so the work done is the area under the force vs. displacement graph, which is a triangle under the curve, but wait, actually, the force is proportional to x, so the graph is a straight line starting at (0,0). So the area under F(x) from 0 to x is a triangle, hence (1/2)k x².

So, the work done (W) is (1/2)k x². We have k=1000 N/m, x=0.08 m.

Wait, but wait: Is the initial position 12 cm, which is the natural length, so x_i = 0 m, and x_f is 0.08 m. So the work done is (1/2) * 1000 * (0.08)^2.

Let me compute that. 0.08 squared is 0.0064. Then, 1000 * 0.0064 is 6.4. Multiply by 1/2, that's 3.2. So 3.2 Joules.

Looking at the options, option D is 3.2 J. So I think that's the correct answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations. Sometimes I make mistakes in the math.

So, k = 30 N / 0.03 m = 1000 N/m. Correct. Then, x_f = 0.08 m.

Work done is (1/2)*k*x² = 0.5 * 1000 * (0.08)^2.

0.08 squared is 0.0064.

1000 * 0.0064 = 6.4.

6.4 * 0.5 = 3.2.

Yep, that's correct. So the answer is D: 3.2 J.

To calculate the work done in stretching the spring from 12 cm to 20 cm, we start by determining the spring constant \( k \) using Hooke's Law: 

\[
F = kx \quad \text{or} \quad k = \frac{F}{x}
\]

Here, \( F = 30 \, \mathrm{N} \) and \( x = 15 \, \mathrm{cm} - 12 \, \mathrm{cm} = 3 \, \mathrm{cm} = 0.03 \, \mathrm{m} \). Substituting:

\[
k = \frac{30}{0.03} = 1000 \, \mathrm{N/m}
\]

Next, the work done to stretch the spring from its natural length (\( x_i = 0 \)) to \( x_f = 20 \, \mathrm{cm} - 12 \, \mathrm{cm} = 8 \, \mathrm{cm} = 0.08 \, \mathrm{m} \) is given by:

\[
W = \frac{1}{2} k x_f^2
\]

Substituting \( k = 1000 \, \mathrm{N/m} \) and \( x_f = 0.08 \, \mathrm{m} \):

\[
W = \frac{1}{2} (1000) (0.08)^2 = \frac{1}{2} (1000) (0.0064) = \frac{1}{2} (6.4) = 3.2 \, \mathrm{J}
\]

Thus, the work done in stretching the spring is \( 3.2 \, \mathrm{J} \), which corresponds to option **D**.
