Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this psychology ethics question. Let me read it carefully. 

The scenario is about a senior psychologist hiring a junior to conduct a research study. The junior runs the experiment, helps analyze the data, and assists in writing up the results. Then, when submitting for publication, the question is about what professional ethics require regarding the junior's credit.

The options are A through J. I remember that in academic publishing, authorship is a big deal and there are ethical guidelines around it. I think the key here is understanding who should be listed as an author.

So, the junior did a lot more than just helping out. They ran the experiment, analyzed data, and helped write the paper. That sounds like they contributed significantly to the research. I recall that authorship typically requires making substantial contributions, like designing the study, collecting data, analyzing it, or writing the manuscript.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Co-author with senior. That makes sense because the junior contributed. But what about the order of authors? Sometimes the first author is the one who did the most work.

Option B: Promotion. Doesn't seem right. The question is about publication credit, not job promotions.

Option C: Percentage of profits. Not really standard practice in academic publishing. Profits from research aren't usually split that way unless it's commercial.

Option D: Credit in a footnote. That seems less than co-authorship. Footnotes are more for acknowledgments rather than author contributions.

Option E: Credited as editor. No, the junior helped write, so editor doesn't fit.

Option F: Acknowledgements section. That's for people who helped but didn't contribute significantly to the research itself. Since the junior did contribute, this might not be enough.

Option G: Thanked. Similar to F, just a thanks without formal credit.

Option H: First author. That's possible if the junior did the majority of the work. But sometimes the senior might be last author as the supervisor.

Option I: Bonus or raise. Again, unrelated to publication ethics.

Option J: Listed as an author. This is broader; being an author could mean co-author or first author.

Now, considering ethical guidelines, like those from APA, authorship should reflect the actual contributions. If someone contributes to the research and writing, they should be an author. So both A and J could be correct, but J is more general. However, looking at the options, J says "listed as an author," which would include being co-author, first author, etc. So J seems correct because it's about being recognized as an author.

Wait, but option A says "co-author with the senior psychologist." That would mean both are authors, but in what order? If the junior did more work, maybe they should be first author. So perhaps H is correct? But the question is about what's required ethically. The key is that the junior must be listed as an author, not necessarily first. So J is the correct answer because it's about being an author, regardless of the order.

So the answer should be J.

The question revolves around the ethical requirements for authorship in academic publishing when a junior psychologist contributes significantly to a research study. The junior's contributions include running the experiment, analyzing data, and assisting in writing the manuscript, which are substantial and warrant formal recognition as an author. Ethical guidelines, such as those from the APA, emphasize that authorship should reflect actual contributions to the research.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Being a co-author is appropriate but does not specify the order of authorship.
- **B, C, I**: These options relate to job promotions, profit sharing, or monetary rewards, which are unrelated to publication ethics.
- **D, F, G**: These involve lesser forms of acknowledgment, such as footnotes or thanks, which do not sufficiently recognize the junior's significant contributions.
- **E**: The role of an editor is not applicable here.
- **H**: While the junior might deserve to be the first author, the question focuses on the requirement of being listed as an author, not specifically the order.
- **J**: This option correctly identifies that the junior must be listed as an author, encompassing any appropriate position in the author list based on their contributions.

Thus, the most accurate and ethical requirement is that the junior psychologist be listed as an author. 

Answer: J
