Okay, so I've got this problem here about a gas expanding and doing work on the atmosphere. Let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on thermodynamics, but I'll take it step by step.

Alright, the problem states that a cylinder initially contains 10 liters of an ideal gas. The pressure is 25 atm, and the temperature is 25°C. Then the valve is opened to the atmosphere, where the pressure is 760 torr and the same temperature, 25°C. The process is isothermal, so temperature remains constant. I need to find the work done by the gas on the atmosphere, in liter-atmospheres.

Hmm, I remember that for an isothermal process, the work done by the gas can be calculated using the formula W = nRT ln(Vf / Vi), but wait, that's when volume changes and pressure is varying. Alternatively, when expanding against a constant external pressure, maybe the formula is different.

Wait, another approach: for expansion against a constant external pressure, the work done is P_ext * (Vf - Vi). But wait, isn't that only when the volume change is at constant pressure? Or when pressure is external and the system is expanding, like pushing against atmospheric pressure.

Wait, let's think. The gas is expanding into the atmosphere, which is at 760 torr. The initial pressure inside is 25 atm. So first, I should convert units to make them compatible.

Because 1 atm is 760 torr, right? So 25 atm is 25 * 760 torr. Let me calculate that: 25 * 760. 25 times 700 is 17,500, and 25 times 60 is 1,500. So 17,500 + 1,500 = 19,000 torr. So initial pressure is 19,000 torr, and the external is 760 torr.

Wait, but when the valve is opened, the gas will expand until the pressure inside equals the atmospheric pressure. Or wait, maybe the process is that the gas expands, pushing against the atmospheric pressure, so the external pressure is 760 torr. So the work done is the external pressure multiplied by the change in volume.

But wait, the initial volume is 10 liters. What's the final volume? Hmm. Since the process is isothermal, we can use Boyle's law, which states that P1 * V1 = P2 * V2. Oh wait, because temperature is constant.

So P1 is 25 atm, V1 is 10 L. P2 is 760 torr. Wait, I need to make sure the units are consistent. Because P1 is in atm, and P2 is in torr. Let me convert P2 into atm.

Since 1 atm = 760 torr, 760 torr is 1 atm. So P2 is 1 atm. So applying Boyle's law:

P1 * V1 = P2 * V2

25 atm * 10 L = 1 atm * V2

So V2 = (25 * 10) / 1 = 250 liters.

So the final volume is 250 liters, initial is 10. So the change in volume is 240 liters. But wait, the work done is the external pressure multiplied by the change in volume. Since the gas is expanding, it's doing work on the surroundings.

External pressure is 1 atm. So work done W = P_ext * (Vf - Vi) = 1 atm * (250 L - 10 L) = 240 L·atm.

Wait, that seems straightforward. So looking at the options, option D is 240 liter-atm. So the correct answer would be D.

Wait, but wait a minute. Another thought: when a gas expands against a lower pressure, the work done is calculated using the external pressure. But I'm remembering that the formula for work when the expansion is against a constant external pressure is W = P_ext (Vf - Vi). Yes, that's correct. And since the process is isothermal, the internal pressure adjusts, but the work is done against the external pressure.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is using the ideal gas law. Since it's isothermal, the work can also be calculated as W = n R T ln(Vf / Vi). Let me try that approach to see if I get the same answer.

First, calculate n using the initial conditions. PV = nRT. Initial P is 25 atm, V is 10 L, T is 25°C which is 298 K.

So n = (PV)/(RT) = (25 atm * 10 L) / (R T). But wait, R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), right? So R = 0.0821.

n = (25 *10) / (0.0821 *298) = (250) / (24.4658) ≈ 10.21 moles.

Now, the final volume V2 is 250 L, as before. So using W = nRT ln(Vf / Vi).

Vf/Vi = 250 /10 =25. So ln(25) is about 3.2189.

W = n R T ln(25) = 10.21 * 0.0821 *298 *3.2189.

Wait, that seems more complex. Let me compute this.

First, compute nRT: 10.21 * 0.0821 *298.

10 *0.0821 is 0.821, 0.0821 * 0.21 is about 0.0172, so total nRT is approx 0.821 +0.0172 =0.8382, multiplied by 298.

0.8382 * 300 is about 251.46, but since it's 298, it's 251.46*(298/300)=approx 251.46 *0.9933≈ 249.6.

Then multiply by ln(25)=3.2189: 249.6 *3.2189≈ ?

Well, 250 *3=750, 250 *0.2189=54.725, so total approx 804.725. But wait, that's in L·atm? Because R is in L·atm/(mol·K), so nRT is in L·atm, and multiplying by ln gives dimensionless, so W is in L·atm.

Wait, but earlier approach gave me 240, this approach is giving me about 804. Hmm, which is way higher. That can't be right. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, no. Wait, no, the formula W = nRT ln(Vf/Vi) is correct for expansion when the pressure is changing, but in this problem, the work is against a constant external pressure. Oh, right, so perhaps the correct approach is the first one, using W = P_ext (Vf - Vi), because the external pressure is the one the gas is pushing against.

Alternatively, perhaps the process is considered as a reversible isothermal expansion, but in that case, the external pressure would equal the internal pressure at every step, and maximum work is done. But in this problem, the expansion is against a constant external pressure (atmospheric), so it's an irreversible process.

Wait, yes. So the correct formula for work done when expanding against a constant external pressure is W = P_ext (Vf - Vi). Hmm. So in that case, my first approach was correct, giving 240 L·atm.

But wait, why does the second approach give a different answer? Because the second approach (nRT ln(Vf/Vi)) is for reversible processes where the system's pressure is equal to the external pressure at each step. So that's the maximum work scenario. But in reality, when the external pressure is lower, the work done is less than that maximum.

Wait, but in this problem, the expansion is against atmospheric pressure, which is lower than the initial pressure. So the work done is P_ext*(Vf - Vi). So that would be 1 atm*(250-10) = 240 L·atm.

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer should be 240, which is option D.

I think I confused myself earlier by mixing up reversible and irreversible processes. The key here is that the process is isothermal and that the expansion is against a constant external pressure, so the correct formula is W = P_ext * ΔV.
</think>

To determine the work done by the gas on the atmosphere during the isothermal expansion, we use the formula for work when expanding against a constant external pressure:

\[
W = P_{\text{ext}} \cdot (V_f - V_i)
\]

### Step 1: Convert pressures to consistent units
The initial pressure of the gas is \( P_1 = 25 \, \text{atm} \), and the external atmospheric pressure is \( P_{\text{ext}} = 760 \, \text{torr} \). Since \( 1 \, \text{atm} = 760 \, \text{torr} \), the external pressure in atm is:

\[
P_{\text{ext}} = 1 \, \text{atm}
\]

### Step 2: Use Boyle's Law to find the final volume
For an isothermal process, Boyle's Law applies:

\[
P_1 \cdot V_1 = P_2 \cdot V_2
\]

Here, \( P_1 = 25 \, \text{atm} \), \( V_1 = 10 \, \text{L} \), and \( P_2 = P_{\text{ext}} = 1 \, \text{atm} \). Solving for \( V_2 \):

\[
V_2 = \frac{P_1 \cdot V_1}{P_2} = \frac{25 \cdot 10}{1} = 250 \, \text{L}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the work done
The work done by the gas is given by:

\[
W = P_{\text{ext}} \cdot (V_f - V_i)
\]

Substituting \( P_{\text{ext}} = 1 \, \text{atm} \), \( V_f = 250 \, \text{L} \), and \( V_i = 10 \, \text{L} \):

\[
W = 1 \cdot (250 - 10) = 240 \, \text{liter-atm}
\]

### Final Answer
The work done by the gas on the atmosphere is **240 liter-atm**, which corresponds to option **D**.
