Okay, so I need to find the speed of gold ions as a fraction of the speed of light when their energy is 100 GeV per nucleon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on relativistic physics, but I'll try to think this through.

Wait, I remember that the total energy of a particle includes its rest mass energy and kinetic energy. The formula for relativistic energy is E = γmc², where γ is the Lorentz factor. Oh right, γ equals 1 over the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared), so γ = 1/√(1 - v²/c²).

The problem gives the energy per nucleon as 100 GeV. I should find the rest mass energy of a gold nucleus to figure this out. Gold has an atomic number of about 79, so each gold nucleus has 79 protons and neutrons. Wait, but the problem says per nucleon, so maybe I should think per nucleon instead of the whole nucleus. Let me think: each nucleon (proton or neutron) has a rest mass of about 0.938 GeV/c². So for a gold nucleus with 197 nucleons (since gold-197 is common), but wait, the problem says per nucleon, so each has 100 GeV energy.

Wait no, the 100 GeV is the kinetic energy per nucleon, or the total energy? Oh wait, the question says "energy of the gold ions is 100 GeV per nucleon." Hmm, that's ambiguous. In particle physics, sometimes when they say energy, they mean kinetic energy. But in others, it's the total energy. So I need to clarify that.

Wait, for particles moving at relativistic speeds, the kinetic energy is (γ-1) mc². The rest mass energy is mc², so the total energy is γ mc². So if the given energy is 100 GeV per nucleon, is that the kinetic or the total? Hmm, I think in collider contexts, the beam energy is usually given as the kinetic energy. So I'll proceed under that assumption.

So each nucleon has kinetic energy K = 100 GeV. And the rest mass energy is mc² ≈ 0.938 GeV. So K = (γ - 1) mc². Let's plug in the numbers.

100 = (γ - 1) * 0.938 → γ - 1 = 100 / 0.938 ≈ 106.55. So γ ≈ 107.55.

Wait but wait, is that right? Because 0.938 GeV is per nucleon, and 100 GeV is per nucleon. So yes, the calculation holds.

Now, I need to find the speed v in terms of c. Since γ = 1 / sqrt(1 - v²/c²), I can solve for v.

Let me rearrange that equation. Let's write γ² = 1 / (1 - v²/c²). So 1 - v²/c² = 1/γ² → v²/c² = 1 - 1/γ². Then take the square root: v/c = sqrt(1 - 1/γ²).

So with γ ≈ 107.55, let's compute 1/γ². 107.55 squared is about 107.55 * 107.55. Let's approximate that. 100² is 10,000, 7.55² is around 57, and the cross terms are 2*100*7.55 = 1510. So 107.55² ≈ 10,000 + 1510 + 57 = 11567. So 1/γ² ≈ 1/11567 ≈ 8.646e-5.

So 1 - 8.646e-5 ≈ 0.99991354. Then the square root of that is sqrt(0.99991354). Hmm, I remember that for numbers very close to 1, sqrt(1 - x) ≈ 1 - x/2 when x is small. So x here is about 8.646e-5, so sqrt ≈ 1 - (8.646e-5)/2 ≈ 0.99995877.

Wait, but wait. Let me check that approximation. Because for x <<1, sqrt(1-x) ≈ 1 - x/2. So with x=8.646e-5, that gives 0.99995877, which is about 0.9999588. So v/c is approximately 0.9999588. So around 0.99996, which would be option J.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation, because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, another approach: using the relation between γ and velocity. For very high γ, the velocity approaches c. So with γ ≈ 107.55, which is pretty high, v should be very close to c.

Wait another thought: when the kinetic energy is much larger than the rest mass energy, the total energy is approximately equal to the kinetic energy plus the rest energy. So when K >> mc², γ is approximately K/(mc²) + 1. But in this case, K is 100 GeV, and mc² is ~1 GeV, so K is 100 times larger. So γ is about 100/0.938 + 1 ≈ 107. So earlier calculation holds.

So using γ ≈107.55, then 1/γ² is about 8.64e-5. So 1 - 8.64e-5 is 0.9999136. The square root of this is sqrt(0.9999136) ≈ 0.9999568. Wait, because 0.9999568 squared is (approx) 0.9999136.

Wait, wait, let me compute it more accurately. Let me compute 0.9999136. Let me think of it as 1 - 8.64e-5.

Alternatively, using a calculator for sqrt(1 - x) where x is small. So sqrt(1 - x) ≈ 1 - x/2 - x²/8. Let's compute x=8.64e-5.

So 1 - x/2 is 1 - 4.32e-5 = 0.99995868.

Then subtract x²/8: x² is (8.64e-5)^2 = 7.46e-9. Divided by 8 gives ~9.325e-10. So 0.99995868 - 9.325e-10 ≈ 0.99995867. So the square root is approximately 0.99995867.

Wait, but that would make v/c ≈ 0.99995867, which is approximately 0.99996. Looking at the options, option J is 0.99996. So the answer should be J.

But wait, another way to calculate v is using the relation involving kinetic energy. Alternatively, using the approximation for high γ, where v ≈ c (1 - (1)/(2γ²)). Because when γ is large, 1/γ² is small, so v = c (1 - (1)/(2γ²)).

So v ≈ c [1 - 1/(2γ²)].

So substituting γ=107.55, 1/(2γ²) = 1/(2*11567) ≈ 4.33e-5. So 1-4.33e-5 ≈ 0.9999587.

So v ≈ 0.9999587 c, which is approximately 0.99996 c.

So the correct answer is J: 0.99996.

To determine the speed of gold ions as a fraction of the speed of light when their energy is 100 GeV per nucleon, we use relativistic energy equations. The total energy of a particle is given by:

\[
E = \gamma mc^2
\]

where \( \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the rest mass, and \( c \) is the speed of light. The rest mass energy of a nucleon is approximately \( 0.938 \, \text{GeV} \), and the problem states that the energy per nucleon is \( 100 \, \text{GeV} \). Assuming this energy is the total energy (kinetic energy + rest energy), we calculate \( \gamma \) as:

\[
\gamma = \frac{E}{mc^2} = \frac{100}{0.938} \approx 107.55
\]

Next, we solve for \( v/c \) using the relation:

\[
\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}} \quad \Rightarrow \quad 1 - v^2/c^2 = \frac{1}{\gamma^2}
\]

\[
v^2/c^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2} \quad \Rightarrow \quad v/c = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}
\]

Substituting \( \gamma \approx 107.55 \), we find:

\[
\gamma^2 \approx 107.55^2 \approx 11567 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{1}{\gamma^2} \approx \frac{1}{11567} \approx 8.646 \times 10^{-5}
\]

\[
v/c = \sqrt{1 - 8.646 \times 10^{-5}} \approx \sqrt{0.99991354}
\]

For values close to 1, \( \sqrt{1 - x} \approx 1 - \frac{x}{2} \). Using this approximation:

\[
v/c \approx 1 - \frac{8.646 \times 10^{-5}}{2} \approx 0.99995877
\]

This corresponds to \( v/c \approx 0.99996 \), which matches option J. The speed of the gold ions as a fraction of the speed of light is therefore:

**J: 0.99996**
