Okay, so I have this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem says: 2 moles of an ideal gas are expanded reversibly and isothermally at 0°C from 1 atm. We need to find the final volume when the heat absorbed during the process is 1 = 750 cal. There are multiple-choice options, so I need to calculate the final volume and match it to the options.

Hmm, alright. I remember that for an isothermal process, especially for an ideal gas, there are some specific formulas we use. Since the process is reversible and isothermal, the work done should relate to the heat absorbed, right?

Wait, the first law of thermodynamics says that ΔU = Q - W. But for an ideal gas undergoing an isothermal process, the internal energy change ΔU is zero because the temperature is constant. So that means Q = W. So the heat absorbed by the gas equals the work done by the gas during expansion.

The problem gives Q as 1 = 750 cal. Wait, wait, the wording is a bit unclear. Oh, I think it's saying that the heat absorbed is 1 times 750 cal. Maybe that's a typo. Probably, the heat Q is 750 cal. Or perhaps it's a different unit. Well, I'll proceed assuming Q is 750 cal.

Since Q = W, the work done by the gas is 750 cal. But wait, in thermodynamics, work done by the gas is considered positive when the gas expands. So W is positive here.

Now, the formula for work done in an isothermal reversible expansion is W = nRT ln(Vf / Vi), where Vf is the final volume and Vi is the initial volume. Alternatively, since pressure is involved, it can also be expressed using pressures: W = nRT ln(Pi / Pf), because PV = nRT. Since T is constant, Vi * Pi = Vf * Pf. So, the ratio of volumes is the inverse of the ratio of pressures.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me get this straight. The formula for work done in expansion is W = nRT ln(Vf / Vi). Alternatively, since P1 V1 = P2 V2 = nRT, for isothermal processes, so V2 = V1 (P1 / P2). But in the work formula, it's also W = nRT ln(P1 / P2), because if you substitute Vf = V1 (P1/P2), then ln(Vf/Vi) = ln(P1/P2). So both expressions are equivalent.

So, moving forward, I can use either approach. Let's proceed.

Given:
n = 2 moles
T = 0°C = 273.15 K
Q = 750 cal, which is the heat absorbed, so W = +750 cal.
But wait, in the formula, work is usually expressed in joules. So I need to convert calories to joules because R is commonly used in J/(mol·K).

Wait, R is 8.314 J/(mol·K), but sometimes when using pressure in atm and volume in liters, R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). Alternatively, using calories, since 1 cal = 4.184 J. Wait, but I'm not sure if I should use R in terms of cal here. Hmm, perhaps better to convert Q into joules.

Wait, let me clarify. The work done W is equal to Q, which is 750 cal. So W = 750 cal. Let's convert that to joules.

1 cal = 4.184 J, so 750 cal = 750 * 4.184 J. Let me calculate that: 750 * 4 is 3000, 750 * 0.184 is approximately 138, so total around 3138 J. Approximately 3138 J.

Wait, but perhaps I should proceed without converting to joules. Alternatively, use R in units of cal. Let me think. R is 8.314 J/(mol·K), but in cal, R is about 1.987 cal/(mol·K). Because 8.314 J/(mol·K) is approximately 8.314 / 4.184 ≈ 1.987 cal/(mol·K). So yeah, R is about 1.987 cal/(mol·K).

So, using R = 1.987 cal/(mol·K), n = 2, T = 273.15 K.

So the formula is W = nRT ln(Vf / Vi). Wait, but wait, W is the work done by the gas, which is positive, so we can plug in the values.

But wait, I also need to know the initial volume Vi. Because the problem states the initial pressure is 1 atm. So perhaps I can calculate the initial volume using the ideal gas law.

Yes, that's right. Since initially, the gas is at 1 atm (which is 1.0 atm), at 0°C (273.15 K), and n=2 moles. So using PV = nRT, I can find Vi.

R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) when using these units. So Vi = nRT/P.

So Vi = (2 mol)(0.0821 L·atm/mol·K)(273.15 K) / (1 atm).

Let me compute that:

2 * 0.0821 = 0.1642
0.1642 * 273.15 ≈ let's see: 0.1642 * 270 = approx 44.334, but since it's 273.15, let me compute it accurately.

0.0821 * 273.15 = let's compute 0.08 * 273.15 = 21.852, 0.0021 * 273.15≈0.5736, so total ≈22.4256. Then times 2: 44.8512 liters. So approximately 44.85 liters.

So Vi ≈44.85 L.

So now, we can write the work W = nRT ln(Vf / Vi).

But wait, W is 750 cal, and R is 1.987 cal/(mol·K). So substituting:

750 cal = (2 mol)(1.987 cal/mol·K)(273.15 K) * ln(Vf / 44.85)

Let me compute the numbers:

2 * 1.987 ≈3.974
3.974 * 273.15 ≈ let's see: 3.974 * 270 = 1073. (3.974 * 273.15)

Let me compute it precisely:

3.974 * 200 = 794.8
3.974 * 73.15 = let's compute 3.974 *70=278.18, 3.974 *3.15≈12.51, so 278.18+12.51=290.69. So total is 794.8 + 290.69 ≈1085.49 cal.

So the equation becomes:

750 = 1085.49 * ln(Vf / 44.85)

So, ln(Vf/44.85) = 750 / 1085.49 ≈ 0.6908

Taking natural exponent on both sides:

Vf /44.85 = e^0.6908 ≈ 1.995

So Vf ≈44.85 * 1.995 ≈ 89.56 liters.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 84.4, E is 110, I is 92.1, H is 120. Hmm, 89.5 is not exactly among the options. Wait, did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I should double-check my calculations.

Wait, I assumed that W = Q = 750 cal. But wait, in thermodynamics, when the system does work (expands), the work is considered positive, so W is positive. But when calculating W as nRT ln(Vf/Vi), is that correct?

Wait, let me check the formula again. The work done by the gas during expansion is W = nRT ln(Vf / Vi). So that's correct. So in this problem, W is positive because the gas is expanding, so Vf > Vi.

Wait, but wait, when a gas expands, the system does work on the surroundings, so W is positive. Correct.

Wait, but in the formula, W = nRT ln(Vf/Vi). So if Vf > Vi, ln is positive, so W is positive. Correct.

Hmm, but my initial calculation gave me Vf ≈89.56 L. But looking at the options, that's not an option. Let me check the options again.

Options:
A:84.4 L
B:44.8 L
C:60 L
D:50 L
E:110 L
F:100 L
G:75 L
H:120 L
I:92.1 L
J:70 L

Hmm, 89 is closest to option I:92.1, but it's not exact. Did I miscalculate?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the conversion of units. Let me double-check.

Wait, I used R as 1.987 cal/(mol·K), which is correct. Then, n=2, T=273.15 K.

So nRT = 2 * 1.987 *273.15.

2 *1.987 is 3.974. 3.974 *273.15. Let me compute that more accurately.

3.974 * 273.15 = ?

Let me break it down:

3.974 * 200 = 794.8

3.974 *70 = 278.18

3.974 *3.15 = Let's compute 3.974 *3 =11.922, 3.974 *0.15=0.5961. So total 12.5181.

Adding all together: 794.8 + 278.18 = 1072.98; 1072.98 +12.5181=1085.4981 cal.

So 3.974 *273.15 = 1085.5 cal/mol.

So the product nRT is approximately 1085.5 cal.

Then, W = nRT ln(Vf/Vi) → 750 = 1085.5 * ln(Vf/44.85)

So ln(Vf/44.85) = 750 /1085.5 ≈ 0.6908.

e^0.6908 ≈ e^0.69 ≈ 2. So 0.69 is about 2, but more precisely, e^0.6908 is approximately 1.995, as I had before.

So Vf is 44.85 * 1.995 ≈ approx 89.5 L.

Hmm, but none of the options exactly match that. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait another thought: The problem says the heat absorbed is 1=750 cal. Maybe that's a typo, perhaps it's 1 cal? No, that can't be. Or perhaps the heat is 750 cal, which is 1 times 750 cal. Hmm, maybe the problem meant to say that the heat is 1, but that can't be, since it's 750 cal.

Wait, perhaps I'm using the wrong units for R. Because when I calculated the initial volume, I used R as 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), which is correct. But when I used R as 1.987 cal/(mol·K), perhaps that's causing a problem because the units for work would be in cal, but I'm using R in cal units.

Wait, alternatively, maybe I should work entirely in J, since the heat is given in cal but perhaps easier to convert to J.

Wait, let's try this approach again, but using R in J/(mol·K) and converting Q to J.

So Q =750 cal → 750 *4.184 J ≈3138 J.

Then, W = Q =3138 J.

So the formula becomes:

W = nRT ln(Vf/Vi)

Using R=8.314 J/(mol·K)

So, 3138 J = 2 *8.314 *273.15 * ln(Vf/44.85)

Compute 2 *8.314 =16.628

16.628 *273.15 ≈ Let me compute it.

16 *273.15 =4369.04

0.628 *273.15 ≈0.6 *273.15=163.89, 0.028*273.≈7.65; total≈163.89+7.65≈171.54

So total≈4369.04 +171.54≈4540.58 J.

So,

3138 =4540.58 * ln(Vf/44.85)

So ln(Vf/44.85) =3138 /4540.58 ≈0.6908

Same as before. So same result, Vf≈89.5 L.

Hmm, same problem. So perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that Q equals W?

Wait, let me think again. For an isothermal process, ΔU is zero, so Q=W. Yes, that's correct. So when heat is absorbed by the system (positive Q), the system does work on the surroundings (positive W). So that part seems correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the work in a different way. Let me think about pressure.

Alternatively, W = nRT ln(Pi / Pf). Since Pi is 1 atm, and we can find Pf.

Because in an isothermal process, Pi Vi = Pf Vf → Pf = Pi Vi / Vf.

But perhaps it's easier to compute using the work formula with pressures.

So W = nRT ln(Pi / Pf) → 3138 J = 2 *8.314 *273.15 * ln(1 / Pf).

Wait, but without knowing Pf, I can't proceed. Alternatively, perhaps I can relate the volumes.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using the initial volume and relate it to the work.

Wait, the initial volume Vi is 44.85 L, as I computed before.

So W = nRT ln(Vf / Vi) → 3138 J = 2 *8.314 *273.15 * ln(Vf/44.85)

Which is the same equation as before. So same result, Vf≈89.5 L.

But the options don't have this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of Vi. Let me recheck that.

Vi = nRT/P → n=2, R=0.0821 L·atm/mol·K, T=273.15 K, P=1 atm.

So Vi = 2 *0.0821 *273.15 /1 = 2 * (0.0821 *273.15).

Compute 0.0821 *273.15:

0.08 *273.15 =21.852

0.0021 *273.15≈0.5736

So total ≈22.4256 L/mol → 2 moles → 44.8512 L. So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the process is expansion, so the volume increases, so the work done is positive. But perhaps the formula requires the use of final pressure or something else.

Wait, another approach: The formula is W = nRT ln(Vf / Vi). Let me compute ln(Vf/44.85) = W/(nRT) = 3138 J / (2*8.314*273.15).

Wait, 2*8.314=16.628; 16.628*273.15= same as before, 4540.58 J.

So 3138 /4540.58 ≈0.6908 → ln(Vf/44.85)=0.6908 → Vf/44.85= e^0.6908≈1.995 → Vf≈44.85 *1.995≈89.5 L.

Still the same result. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem states that the heat absorbed is 1, which is 750 cal? Or maybe the heat is 1, which is 1 cal, and 750 is something else. Hmm, the wording is a bit confusing.

Wait, the problem says, "the heat absorbed during the process is 1 = 750 cal." I think that might mean that 1 represents 750 cal, perhaps a typo. So Q=750 cal.

Wait, perhaps the problem gave the heat as 1×750 cal, which is 750 cal, but perhaps I'm missing a factor.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate using the ideal gas law and the work done in terms of pressure. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in units when using R in cal vs J. Let me try to compute using R in cal.

So, using R =1.987 cal/(mol·K), n=2, T=273.15 K.

Work done W =750 cal = nRT ln(Vf/Vi).

So,

750 = 2 *1.987 *273.15 * ln(Vf/44.85)

Compute 2*1.987 =3.974; 3.974 *273.15 ≈1085.5 cal.

So,

ln(Vf/44.85) =750 /1085.5 ≈0.6908 → same as before.

So same result, Vf≈89.5 L.

But the options don't have this. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, maybe the work formula is different. Wait, maybe I should have used W = -nRT ln(Vf/Vi), because the system is doing work, so W is negative? No, wait, in physics, work done by the system is positive. So the formula is correct.

Wait, perhaps the heat is negative? No, the heat is absorbed by the system, so positive.

Wait, perhaps I should have used Q = W, but with a negative sign. Wait, no, when the system absorbs heat, Q is positive, and when it does work, W is positive. So for an isothermal expansion, Q = W, both positive.

Hmm. Another thought: Maybe the process is irreversible? No, the question states it's reversible.

Wait, perhaps the value of R I'm using is incorrect. Let me check R in different units.

R is 8.314 J/(mol·K), which is correct. In cal, R is 1.987 cal/(mol·K). Correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using a different value for R, like 8.31 J/(mol·K) or 2 cal/(mol·K), which could slightly change the result.

Let me try with R=8.31 J/(mol·K).

So, W=3138 J = nRT ln(Vf/Vi).

nRT =2 *8
