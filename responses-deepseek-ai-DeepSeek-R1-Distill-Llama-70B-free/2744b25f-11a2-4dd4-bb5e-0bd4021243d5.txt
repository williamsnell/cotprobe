Okay, so I have this problem here about vapor pressure of a solution, and I'm supposed to find the right answer. Let me think. Hmm, I remember something about Raoult's Law from chemistry class. Raoult's Law says that the vapor pressure of a solution is equal to the mole fraction of the solvent times the vapor pressure of the pure solvent. But wait, wait. Oh right, if there are two components, it's the sum of each component's mole fraction times their pure vapor pressures.

Wait, wait. The problem says it's a solution where the mole fraction of benzene is 0.28. Oh, so that's x_benzene = 0.28. So the other component must be hexane. Because in a solution with two volatile components, each contributes to the total vapor pressure.

So the total vapor pressure P_total is P_benzene + P_hexane. Each of these is calculated by the mole fraction of the component multiplied by their pure vapor pressures.

Wait, but wait a second. Benzene is a solvent, right? Or is hexane the solvent? Oh, no, wait. The problem says the solution has x_benzene = 0.28. So that's the mole fraction of benzene in the liquid solution. So the mole fraction of hexane would be 1 - 0.28 = 0.72.

So for benzene, its partial vapor pressure is x_benzene * P_pure_benzene. Similarly for hexane, it's x_hexane * P_pure_hexane. So P_total = (x_benzene * P_benzene) + (x_hexane * P_hexane).

Wait, the pure vapor pressures given are at 303 K. Benzene's is 120 Torr, hexane's is 189 Torr.

So let me plug in the numbers. x_benzene is 0.28. So P_benzene = 0.28 * 120 = let's calculate that. 0.28 * 120 is 33.6 Torr.

Then x_hexane is 0.72. P_hexane = 0.72 * 189. Let me compute that. 0.72 times 189. Let's see, 0.7 * 189 is 132.3, and 0.02 * 189 is 3.78. So 132.3 + 3.78 = 136.08 Torr.

So the total vapor pressure is 33.6 + 136.08 = 169.68 Torr. Hmm, which is approximately 170 Torr. Looking at the options, option A is 170 Torr, and option H is 180. So the closest is A:170.

Wait, but wait another thing. Oh, wait, no. Wait, I think I may have mixed up the components. Because the problem says "the vapor pressure of a solution for which x_benzene is 0.28". So that's correct because I used x_benzene as 0.28 and x_hexane as 0.72.

Alternatively, what if I had the other way around? Like, but no, because if the mole fraction of benzene is 0.28, then hexane is 0.72. So that calculation should be right. So 170 is the answer, which is option A.

Wait, checking the options again. Option A is 170. So I think that's the correct choice.

To calculate the vapor pressure of the solution, Raoult's Law is applied. The total vapor pressure of the solution is the sum of the partial vapor pressures of each component, which are calculated as:

\[
P_{\text{total}} = (x_{\text{benzene}} \cdot P_{\text{benzene}}^{\text{pure}}) + (x_{\text{hexane}} \cdot P_{\text{hexane}}^{\text{pure}})
\]

Given:
- \( x_{\text{benzene}} = 0.28 \)
- \( P_{\text{benzene}}^{\text{pure}} = 120 \, \text{Torr} \)
- \( P_{\text{hexane}}^{\text{pure}} = 189 \, \text{Torr} \)
- \( x_{\text{hexane}} = 1 - x_{\text{benzene}} = 0.72 \)

First, calculate the partial vapor pressure of benzene:
\[
P_{\text{benzene}} = x_{\text{benzene}} \cdot P_{\text{benzene}}^{\text{pure}} = 0.28 \cdot 120 = 33.6 \, \text{Torr}
\]

Next, calculate the partial vapor pressure of hexane:
\[
P_{\text{hexane}} = x_{\text{hexane}} \cdot P_{\text{hexane}}^{\text{pure}} = 0.72 \cdot 189 = 136.08 \, \text{Torr}
\]

Finally, add the partial pressures to find the total vapor pressure:
\[
P_{\text{total}} = P_{\text{benzene}} + P_{\text{hexane}} = 33.6 + 136.08 = 169.68 \, \text{Torr}
\]

This value is approximately \( 170 \, \text{Torr} \), which corresponds to option **A**.
