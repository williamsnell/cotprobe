Question:

Explain what is meant by an animal's ecological niche, and definecompetitive exclusion.

Options:

A: Niche refers to the specific diet of an organism, while competitive exclusion is the dominance of one species over another in acquiring food.
B: Niche is the physical area where an organism lives
C: An ecological niche is the temperature range an organism prefers, and competitive exclusion means that species with the same temperature preferences cannot live in the same area.
D: Niche is defined by the habitat of an organism
E: Competitive exclusion means two species with similar niches can coexist in the same habitat
F: Niche is the functional role and position of an organism within its ecosystem. Competitive exclusion states that unless the niches of two species differ, they cannot coexist in the same habitat.
G: Competitive exclusion refers to the idea that no two species can share the same predators, while a niche is determined by the predators of an organism.
H: Niche is the set of behaviors an organism exhibits, and competitive exclusion implies that two species will eventually merge into one if they have similar behaviors.
I: Niche is the social role of an organism in a group, and competitive exclusion dictates that two species with the same social roles cannot exist together in a social group.
J: Ecological niche is the time of day an animal is most active. Competitive exclusion suggests that two species cannot be active at the same time.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about ecological niches and competitive exclusion. Hmm, I remember from my biology class that these are important concepts in ecology. Let me try to think through each part carefully.

First, the question asks what an ecological niche is and defines competitive exclusion. So I need to understand both terms correctly.

I think an ecological niche is more than just where an organism lives. I remember it's about the role and position the organism has in its environment. Like, it includes what resources it uses, how it interacts with other species, and the conditions it needs to survive. So it's a multi-faceted concept, not just the physical space.

Wait, some options might confuse habitat with niche. Habitat is the physical area where an organism lives, like a forest or a desert. But the niche is broader, including things like what they eat, when they're active, and how they interact with predators or prey.

Now, competitive exclusion. I recall something called the competitive exclusion principle. It's about how two species can't occupy the exact same niche in the same environment. So if two species are competing for the exact same resources, one will outcompete the other, leading to exclusion. That means they can't coexist if their niches are identical.

So looking at the options, I need to find one that correctly defines both niche and competitive exclusion.

Option A says niche is the specific diet, and competitive exclusion is dominance in acquiring food. Well, diet is part of the niche, but niche is more than that. So A might be too narrow.

Option B says niche is the physical area, which is actually the habitat, so B is incorrect.

Option C talks about temperature range and same area. Again, niche is more than just temperature, so C is wrong.

Option D: Niche is habitat. Again, no, that's wrong.

Option E: Competitive exclusion allows coexistence with similar niches. Wait, no, the principle says they can't coexist if niches are too similar. So E is incorrect.

Option F: Niche is the functional role and position. Competitive exclusion states that unless niches differ, species can't coexist. That sounds right. So F looks correct.

Option G: Competitive exclusion about predators and niche determined by predators. I don't think that's right. Competitive exclusion is more about resources, not just predators.

Option H: Merging species because of behaviors. No, that's not correct. Competitive exclusion leads to one species dominating, not merging.

Option I: Social roles in a group. That's more about social structures, not ecological niches. So I is wrong.

Option J: Time of day active. That's part of the niche, like being diurnal or nocturnal, but J reduces niche to just that aspect, which is incomplete.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be F. It correctly defines the ecological niche as the functional role and position, and competitive exclusion as the principle that species with similar niches can't coexist.

The ecological niche refers to the functional role and position of an organism within its ecosystem, encompassing factors such as resource use, interactions with other species, and environmental conditions. Competitive exclusion is the principle that two species with identical or highly overlapping niches cannot coexist in the same habitat, as one will outcompete the other.

The correct answer is **F**.

F
