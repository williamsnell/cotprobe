Okay, so I have this problem about Holmes Bros accepting a draft, and I need to figure out two parts: (a) how much they paid when it was due, and (b) the proceeds if it was discounted early with a collection fee. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

First, the draft is dated July 10 and is for $326.80 at 5%, payable 90 days after date. So part (a) is about calculating the amount paid at maturity. I remember that when a note is paid at maturity, the amount is the face value plus the interest. The interest here would be simple interest, I think, because it's a short term (90 days).

The formula for simple interest is I = P * r * t. But wait, time here is in days, and the rate is annual. So I need to convert the days into a fraction of a year. Oh right, they specified a 360-day year, so that's easy.

So P is $326.80, r is 5% or 0.05, and t is 90/360. Let me compute that. 90 divided by 360 is 0.25. So I = 326.80 * 0.05 * 0.25. Let's calculate that: 326.80 * 0.05 is 16.34, and then multiplied by 0.25 is 4.085. So the interest is about $4.085. Adding that to the principal gives 326.80 + 4.085 = 330.885. Wait, but looking at the options, I see some are $330.89, so maybe rounding up gives that. So part (a) would be $330.89.

Wait wait, but looking at the options, some have $326.80 as the first answer. Did I get that wrong? Because if it's a draft, maybe it's a bill that Holmes Bros. has to pay. So when the draft is accepted, they become the drawee, and when it's due, they have to pay the face value plus interest. So yes, part (a) is the amount paid at maturity, which is 326.80 plus interest, which I calculated as $4.085. So it's $330.885, which I'll round to $330.89.

Now part (b) is trickier. The draft is discounted at 5.5% (since 5 and a half percent is 5.5%) 30 days before maturity, and there's a 0.25% collection fee. So I need to calculate the proceeds from discounting.

Wait, discounting means the bank is paying Holmes Bros. the present value now, deducting the interest and any fees. So the formula for the proceeds would be the face value minus the discounted interest and minus the collection fee.

Alternatively, I can think of it as calculating the present value of the note 30 days before maturity.

So the original note's maturity is 90 days, so if it's discounted 30 days before, the remaining time is 60 days. Wait, no. Wait, the note is due 90 days after July 10. If it's discounted 30 days before maturity, that would be on day 60 (since 90-30=60), so the time from discounting to maturity is 30 days. So the time factor is 30/360 = 1/12 of a year.

The discount rate is 5.5%, so the interest would be calculated on the face value for the remaining 30 days.

So I = 326.80 * 0.055 * (30/360). Let's compute that. 30/360 is 0.083333. So 326.80 * 0.055 is 17.974, multiplied by 0.083333 gives approximately 1.4978. So the interest is about $1.50.

Then, the collection fee is 0.25% of the face value. So that's 326.80 * 0.0025. Let's calculate that: 326.80 * 0.0025 = 0.817.

So the total amount deducted is the interest plus the fee: 1.4978 + 0.817 = approximately 2.3148. Therefore, the proceeds would be 326.80 minus 2.3148, which is 324.4852. Wait, that's about $324.49, but looking at the options, that's not matching. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I got the discounting method wrong. Another approach is to compute the present value. The present value is the amount that, when increased by the interest for the discount period, equals the face value. So the formula is PV = FV / (1 + rt).

Wait, but wait: when discounting, the interest is calculated, and that's subtracted from the face value to get the proceeds. So the discount is the interest for the remaining period. So the proceeds would be FV minus discount. Then, subtract the collection fee.

So FV is 326.80. The discount is 326.80 * (0.055) * (30/360). Let me compute that again. 30/360 is 0.083333. 0.055 * 0.083333 is approx 0.0045833. Multiply that by 326.80: 326.80 * 0.0045833 ≈ 1.497. So discount is ~1.50. Then, collection fee is 0.25% of FV, which is 0.25/100 * 326.80 = 0.817. So total deductions are 1.497 + 0.817 ≈ 2.314. So proceeds are 326.80 - 2.314 ≈ 324.486, which is ~324.49. But none of the options have this. So I must be doing something wrong.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the present value differently. Maybe using 360-day year for the discounting. Alternatively, perhaps the discount is calculated as (rate * time * principal), and then subtracted along with the collection fee.

Wait another approach: The bank discounts the note, so the proceeds are the face value minus the interest for the unexpired time (30 days) at 5.5%, minus the collection fee of 0.25%.

So, interest for 30 days: 326.80 * 5.5% * (30/360) = 1.497.

Collection fee: 326.80 * 0.25% = 0.817.

Total deductions: 1.497 + 0.817 = 2.314.

Proceeds: 326.80 - 2.314 = 324.486. That's about 324.49. But looking at the options, I don't see that. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm supposed to calculate the present value using the formula for discounting, which is FV / (1 + r*t). Let me try that.

r is 5.5% per annum, t is 30/360 = 1/12.

So PV = 326.80 / (1 + 0.055*(1/12)).

Compute denominator: 0.055/12 = 0.0045833. So denominator is 1.0045833.

326.80 / 1.0045833 ≈ let's compute that. Let's see, 326.80 / 1.0045833. Let me compute 326.80 / 1.0045833.

Well, 1.0045833 ≈ 1.004583. So 326.80 divided by 1.004583 is approximately:

Let me compute 326.80 / 1.004583.

Approximating, 1.004583 is about 1.0046. So 326.80 / 1.0046 = ?

Well, 326.80 * (1/1.0046) ≈ 326.80 * 0.9954 ≈ 326.80 * (1 - 0.0046) = 326.80 - (326.80 * 0.0046).

Compute 326.80 * 0.0046: 326.80 * 0.004 = 1.3072, 0.0006 * 326.80 = 0.19608. So total is approx 1.3072 + 0.19608 = 1.50328. So 326.80 - 1.50328 ≈ 325.2967.

Then, subtract the collection fee of 0.25% of FV, which is 0.817. So 325.2967 - 0.817 = 324.4797, which is about 324.48. Still, none of the options match.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the process. Perhaps the collection fee is applied after discounting, but maybe it's a flat fee, not a percentage. Wait, the problem says a 1/4% collection fee was charged. So it's 0.25% of... I thought of the face value. Maybe it's on the proceeds? Or perhaps on the discounted amount.

Wait, the problem says a (1/4)% collection fee was charged. So perhaps it's 0.25% of the face value. So my initial calculation was correct.

Hmm, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try to compute the interest again. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the discount and then subtract it and the fee from the face value.

Wait, maybe I should think of the discount as the interest that would accrue from the date of discounting to the due date. So the discount is 326.80 * (5.5%) * (30/360) = 1.497, as before. Then, the proceeds are FV minus discount minus fee. So 326.80 -1.497 -0.817 = 324.486. So that's 324.49. But none of the options have that. Wait, looking at the options, let's see. Option J is (a) 330.89, (b) 327.20. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the collection fee differently. Maybe the fee is applied to the amount after discounting, not the face value. So first, compute the present value after discounting, then subtract the fee on that.

Wait, let me try that approach. So the present value after discounting is 326.80 / (1 + (0.055)*(30/360)) = 326.80 / 1.0045833 ≈ 325.30. Then, subtract the collection fee of 0.25% of that. So 0.25% of 325.30 is 0.81325. So proceeds are 325.30 - 0.81325 ≈ 324.48675, still about 324.49. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the time is being considered differently. Oh wait, the discounting is done 30 days before maturity. So the time for discounting is 30 days, correct. But perhaps the interest calculation uses 360 days in another way. Let me think again.

Another approach: Calculate the discount as (face value * rate * time). So 326.80 * 0.055 * (30/360) = 1.497. Then, the collection fee is 326.80 * 0.0025 = 0.817. So total deductions are 1.497 + 0.817 = 2.314. So proceeds are 326.80 - 2.314 = 324.486, which is ~324.49. Still not matching options.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the discounting periods. Let me double-check the original problem. It says the draft is dated July 10, payable 90 days after date. So due date is October 8 (July has 31 days, so July 10 + 90 days is October 8). If it's discounted 30 days before maturity, that would be September 8. So the time from September 8 to October 8 is 30 days. So the discount period is 30 days.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the discount is calculated using 360 days, but in the formula, the time is 30 days, so 30/360 is correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that in part (a) I have $330.89, but looking at the options, some have $330.89 as part (a), others have $326.80. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in part (a). Let me re-examine part (a).

Part (a) asks, how much was paid when due. That would be the face value plus interest. The interest is 5% for 90 days on $326.80. So I = 326.80 * 0.05 * (90/360) = 326.80 * 0.05 * 0.25 = 4.085. So total is 326.80 + 4.085 = 330.885, which is $330.89. So that's correct.

But looking at the options, for example, option I is (a) 330.89, (b) 328.54. Option J is (a) 330.89, (b) 327.20.

Wait, in part (b), could I have made a miscalculation? Maybe I should try another approach, like using the simple interest formula for the discount period.

Alternatively, perhaps the collection fee is on the proceeds, so after discounting. So first, compute the discounted value, then subtract the fee on that amount.

So, discounted amount without fee: 326.80 - (326.80 * 0.055 * 30/360) = 326.80 - 1.497 = 325.303. Then, the collection fee is 0.25% of 325.303, which is 0.8132575. So proceeds are 325.303 - 0.8132575 ≈ 324.4897, still about 324.49.

But none of the options have this. So perhaps I'm using the wrong approach. Maybe the problem is that the draft is accepted by Holmes Bros, meaning they are the drawee, so when the draft is presented, they have to pay. So in part (a), when due, they pay face value plus interest, which is 330.89.

In part (b), if the draft is discounted 30 days before maturity at 5.5%, with a 0.25% fee. So the proceeds would be the present value minus the fee. Let me compute the present value again.

PV = FV / (1 + rt), where r=5.5%, t=30/360=0.083333.

So PV = 326.80 / (1 + 0.055 * 0.083333) = 326.80 / 1.0045833 ≈ 325.296.

Then, subtract the collection fee of 0.25% on the PV. So 325.296 * 0.0025 ≈ 0.81324. So proceeds are 325.296 - 0.81324 ≈ 324.48276.

Still, none of the options have 324.48. Hmm. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the fee. Perhaps the collection fee is a flat fee, like 0.25% of the face value, regardless of discounting.

Wait, the problem says a 1/4% collection fee was charged. So 0.25% of FV, which is 0.25/100 * 326.80 = 0.817. So the proceeds after discounting and fee would be 325.296 - 0.817 ≈ 324.479, which is 324.48. Still no match.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the discounting calculation. Let me try using the simple interest formula for the discount.

The discount is I = P * r * t = 326.80 * 0.055 * (30/360) = 326.80 * 0.055 * 0.083333 ≈ 1.497. So the proceeds before fee are 326.80 - 1.497 = 325.303. Then, subtract the fee: 0.25% of 326.80 is 0.817. So 325.303 - 0.817 ≈ 324.486, same as before.

Alternatively, maybe the fee is applied to the discounted proceeds, not the face value. Let me try that. So if the discounted amount is 325.303, then 0.25% of that is 0.8132575. So 325.303 - 0.8132575 ≈ 324.4897, same as before.

Hmm. I'm stuck because none of the options match this. Wait, let me look at the options again. Option J is (a) 330.89, (b) 327.20. How would part (b) be 327.20?

Wait, perhaps I should compute the interest as 5.5% on the present value for 30 days. Wait, no, that's not how discounting works. Alternatively, perhaps the time is being considered differently.

Wait, another angle: Maybe the interest is calculated using 360 days for the discounting period. So for part (b), the interest is (5.5%) * (30/360) * 326.80. So that's what I did, which gives 1.497.

Wait, perhaps the collection fee is applied to the principal only, so it's 326.80 * 0.0025 = 0.817. So total deductions are 1.497 + 0.817 = 2.314. So proceeds are 326.80 - 2.314 = 324.486.

Alternatively, maybe the collection fee is 0.25% of the discounted amount. So the discount is 1.497, so proceeds before fee are 325.303. Then, fee is 0.25% of 325.303, which is 0.8132. So 325.303 - 0.8132 = 324.4897.

Still not matching any options. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in part (a). Let me check again.

Wait, part (a) is when they pay at maturity. The amount is principal plus interest. Interest is 5% for 90 days. So 326.80 * 0.05 * 0.25 = 4.085. So 326.80 + 4.085 = 330.885, which is $330.89. So part (a) is correct.

Looking back at part (b), perhaps I should calculate the proceeds differently. Wait, maybe the formula is proceeds = face value - (face value * rate * time) - (face value * fee rate). So, 326.80 - (326.80 * 0.055 * 30/360) - (326.80 * 0.0025)
