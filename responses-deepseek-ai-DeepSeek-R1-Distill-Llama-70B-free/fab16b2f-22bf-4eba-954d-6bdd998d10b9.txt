Okay, so I have this problem about finding the minimum vertex cover of a graph. Hmm, I remember that a vertex cover is a set of vertices such that every edge in the graph is incident to at least one vertex in the set. The goal is to find the smallest possible such set.

The graph is given with edges E = { a bunch of <A,B> pairs }. Let me write them all out to visualize better. The edges are:

<0,2>, <1,4>, <9,6>, <8,12>, <2,4>, <1,3>, <1,5>, <12,1>, <8,1>, <5,9>, <0,10>, <5,2>, <0,8>, <3,4>, <3,11>, <7,1>, <2,1>, <0,12>, <1,0>, <7,8>.

Wait, let me list all edges clearly:

0-2, 1-4, 9-6, 8-12, 2-4, 1-3, 1-5, 12-1, 8-1, 5-9, 0-10, 5-2, 0-8, 3-4, 3-11, 7-1, 2-1, 0-12, 1-0, 7-8.

Wait, I see some duplicates maybe. Like, <1,0> is the same as <0,1>, but in the list I have <1,0> and <0,12> etc. Wait, no, looking again, the edges are each unique pairs.

So, the graph has nodes from 0 to 12, I think. Let me count: nodes 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12. That's 13 nodes.

Now, to find the minimum vertex cover. I remember that for bipartite graphs, Konig's theorem says that the size of the maximum matching equals the size of the minimum vertex cover. But I'm not sure if this graph is bipartite. Alternatively, another approach is to model it as an integer linear programming problem, but that's probably not the way to go here.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a maximum matching and then use Konig's theorem. But first, I need to check if the graph is bipartite. Let me see if it's bipartitionable.

Wait, bipartite graphs are two-colorable, meaning no odd-length cycles. Let me try to see if the graph has any cycles. Hmm, I'm not sure. Let me try to look for cycles.

Looking at the edges:

For example, 0-2, 2-4, 4-1, 1-0. So 0-2-4-1-0 forms a cycle. Let's see the length: that's 4 edges, so even. So that's an even cycle, which is fine for bipartition.

Another possible cycle: 1-3-4-2-5-9-6, but wait, let's see. 1-3, 3-4, 4-2, 2-5? Wait, 2-5 is not directly connected. Hmm, maybe another way.

Wait, 1 is connected to 5, which is connected to 2, which is connected to 4, connected to 3, connected back to 1. So 1-5-2-4-3-1: that's a 5-edge cycle, which is odd. So that's a problem because an odd cycle means the graph isn't bipartite. So Konig's theorem doesn't apply here.

Hmm, so I can't use that approach. Maybe I should try another method. Since the graph isn't bipartite, finding the minimum vertex cover is more complex. Maybe I can look for a maximal matching and see if it's possible to find a minimal vertex cover.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a problem and see if I can find a vertex cover by inspection. Let me try to see which nodes are connected to many others, perhaps including them would cover more edges.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the concept of maximum matching and Konig's theorem, but perhaps the graph is bipartite? Did I make a mistake earlier?

Wait, let me re-examine the cycle I thought was of length 5. Let me see:

Edges: 1-5, 5-2, 2-4, 4-3, 3-1. So that's 1-5-2-4-3-1. That's 5 edges, forming a cycle of length 5. So yes, that's an odd cycle, meaning the graph is not bipartite. So Konig's theorem doesn't apply here.

So perhaps the way to approach this is to find a way to cover all edges with as few nodes as possible.

Let me list all the edges and see which nodes are involved.

Edges:

1. 0-2
2. 1-4
3. 9-6
4. 8-12
5. 2-4
6. 1-3
7. 1-5
8. 12-1
9. 8-1
10. 5-9
11. 0-10
12. 5-2
13. 0-8
14. 3-4
15. 3-11
16. 7-1
17. 2-1
18. 0-12
19. 1-0
20. 7-8.

Wait, but 1-0 is same as 0-1. So edge 19 is 0-1, which is same as edge 20 perhaps? Or wait, let me count the edges again.

Wait, perhaps I should clarify all edges. Let me list all the edges without duplication.

Wait, the given edges are:

<0,2>, <1,4>, <9,6>, <8,12>, <2,4>, <1,3>, <1,5>, <12,1>, <8,1>, <5,9>, <0,10>, <5,2>, <0,8>, <3,4>, <3,11>, <7,1>, <2,1>, <0,12>, <1,0>, <7,8>.

Wait, that's 20 edges? Or maybe some are duplicates. For example, <1,0> is same as <0,1>, but in the list, perhaps it's listed twice? Let me check.

Wait, the edges are: 

1. <0,2>
2. <1,4>
3. <9,6>
4. <8,12>
5. <2,4>
6. <1,3>
7. <1,5>
8. <12,1>
9. <8,1>
10. <5,9>
11. <0,10>
12. <5,2>
13. <0,8>
14. <3,4>
15. <3,11>
16. <7,1>
17. <2,1>
18. <0,12>
19. <1,0>
20. <7,8>.

Wait, so edge 19 is <1,0>, which is same as 0 connected to 1. Earlier, edge 17 is <2,1>, which is 1-2, and edge 19 is 1-0. So all are unique edges.

So the graph has 20 edges.

Now, to find a vertex cover. Let's think about which nodes are connected to the most edges.

Let me count the degree of each node:

Node 0: connected to 2, 10, 8, 12, 1. So degree 5.

Node 1: connected to 4,3,5,12,8,7,2,0. So degree 8.

Node 2: connected to 0,4,5,1. Degree 4.

Node 3: connected to 1,4,11. Degree 3.

Node 4: connected to 1,2,3. Degree 3.

Node 5: connected to 1,9,2. Degree 3.

Node 6: connected to 9. Degree 1.

Node 7: connected to 1,8. Degree 2.

Node 8: connected to 12,1,0,7. Degree 4.

Node 9: connected to 6,5. Degree 2.

Node 10: connected to 0. Degree 1.

Node 11: connected to 3. Degree 1.

Node 12: connected to 8,1,0. Degree 3.

So node 1 has the highest degree, 8. So including node 1 in the vertex cover would cover 8 edges.

But perhaps that's not the most efficient way. Alternatively, perhaps nodes 1, 8, 0 would cover a lot of edges.

Wait, let's see the edges connected to node 1:

Edges: <1,4>, <1,3>, <1,5>, <12,1>, <8,1>, <7,1>, <2,1>, <1,0>.

So if I include node 1, all these edges are covered.

Similarly, node 8 is connected to 12,1,0,7. So including 8 would cover edges <8,12>, <8,1>, <0,8>, <7,8>.

Node 0 is connected to 2,10,8,12,1. So including 0 would cover edges <0,2>, <0,10>, <0,8>, <0,12>, <0,1>.

Wait, but if I include 0 and 1 and 8, that's three nodes, but let's see how many edges they cover.

Edges covered by 0: 0-2, 0-10, 0-8, 0-12, 0-1.

Edges covered by 1: 1-4, 1-3, 1-5, 12-1 (already covered by 0?), 8-1 (covered by 8), 7-1, 2-1.

Wait, so 1-4, 1-3,1-5,7-1,2-1 would be covered by 1. But 12-1 and 8-1 are already covered by 0 and 8.

Edges covered by 8: 8-12, 8-1, 0-8, 7-8.

So together, 0,1,8 cover a lot of edges. Let's see what's left.

Looking at the edges:

After including 0,1,8:

Which edges are not yet covered?

Edges:

- 9-6: neither 9 nor 6 is in the cover.

- 5-9: 5 is connected to 9, but 5 isn't in the cover.

- 3-4: 3 is connected to 4, but 3 and 4 are not in the cover.

- 3-11: 3 is not in the cover.

- 5-2: 5 is not in the cover, 2 is not in the cover.

- 2-4: 2 and 4 not covered.

Wait, but wait, 2 is connected to 0, which is in the cover, so 2-0 is covered. But 2-4 is an edge where neither 2 nor 4 is in the cover (since 0 is in cover, 2 is connected to 0, but 2-4's other end is 4, which is not in the cover. So 2-4 would not be covered.

Wait, no: if either node of the edge is in the cover, the edge is covered. So for edge 2-4, if either 2 or 4 is in the cover, it's covered. So if I have 0,1,8 in the cover, then 2 is connected to 0, which is in the cover, so edge 2-4 is covered via 2. Wait, no: 2 is not in the cover. Wait, 0 is in the cover, so edge 0-2 is covered, but 2-4 is another edge. So 2-4 is between 2 and 4, neither of which are in the cover, so it's not covered.

So that's a problem. So including 0,1,8 isn't enough because several edges remain uncovered.

So perhaps we need to include more nodes.

Let me think of another approach. Maybe find a maximal matching and then use that to find a vertex cover, but since the graph isn't bipartite, Konig's theorem doesn't apply. Alternatively, perhaps find a way to pick the minimal number of nodes.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model this as a problem where each selected node covers certain edges, and I need to select the minimal number of nodes such that all edges are covered.

Let me try to list the edges and find a minimal cover.

Let's list all edges:

1. 0-2
2. 1-4
3. 9-6
4. 8-12
5. 2-4
6. 1-3
7. 1-5
8. 12-1
9. 8-1
10. 5-9
11. 0-10
12. 5-2
13. 0-8
14. 3-4
15. 3-11
16. 7-1
17. 2-1
18. 0-12
19. 1-0
20. 7-8

Now, let's see which edges are connected to nodes that are leaves (degree 1).

Nodes 10 (degree 1, connected to 0), 6 (degree 1, connected to 9), 11 (degree 1, connected to 3).

So edges 0-10, 9-6, and 3-11 are connected to these leaves. To cover these edges, we need at least one node from each of these edges. So for edge 0-10: either 0 or 10. For 9-6: 9 or 6. For 3-11: 3 or 11.

If we include 0, 9, and 3, that would cover these edges. Alternatively, including 10,6,11 would also cover them, but including the leaves would require three nodes, whereas including 0,9,3 might cover more edges.

Let me think: including 0 would cover edges 0-2, 0-10, 0-8, 0-12, 0-1. Including 9 would cover 9-6 and 5-9. Including 3 would cover 3-4, 3-11, 1-3.

But maybe that's not the most efficient way. Let's see.

Alternatively, let's see which edges are only connected to high-degree nodes. For example, edge 9-6: if I don't include 9 or 6, that edge isn't covered. So I must include at least one of them. Similarly for 3-11 and 0-10.

So, perhaps including 0 would be better than including 10 because 0 is connected to many more edges.

Similarly, including 9 would be better than 6 because 9 is connected to more edges.

Including 3 would be better than 11 because 3 is connected to more edges.

So let's include 0, 9, 3.

Now, the edges covered by these three are:

0 covers edges 0-2, 0-10, 0-8, 0-12, 0-1.

9 covers 9-6, 5-9.

3 covers 1-3, 3-4, 3-11.

Now, let's see which edges are left:

Edges not yet covered:

1. 2-4 (edge 5) → 2 and 4 are not in cover.

2. 5-2 (edge 12) →5 and 2 not in cover.

3. 2-1 (edge 17) → but 1 is connected to 0, which is in the cover. So 2-1 is covered via 0? No, because 2-1 is an edge between 2 and 1. 1 is not in the cover (we've included 0,9,3 so far). Wait, no, 1 is connected to 0, so 0 is in the cover, so edge 0-1 is covered, but 2-1 is a different edge. So 2-1 is between 2 and 1, neither of which is in the cover (since 0 is in the cover, but 2 and 1 are not). So 2-1 is not covered.

Wait, but 1 is connected to 0, which is in the cover, so edge 1-0 is covered. But 2-1 is a separate edge. So that edge remains.

So, edge 2-1 is not yet covered.

Similarly, 1-4 (edge 2) → 1 is not in cover, 4 is not.

1-5 (edge7) → 1 not in cover, 5 not in cover.

12-1 (edge8) → 12 not in cover, 1 not.

8-1 (edge9) → 8 not in cover, 1 not.

7-1 (edge16) →7 not, 1 not.

5-2 (edge12) →5 not, 2 not.

2-4 (edge5) →2 not,4 not.

3-4 (edge14) →3 is in cover, so that's covered.

Wait, no: 3 is in the cover, so any edge connected to 3 is covered. So 3-4 is covered.

Wait, but 2-4 is edge5: 2 and 4. 4 is not in the cover, 2 is not.

Wait, but 2 is connected to 0, which is in the cover, so edge 0-2 is covered, but 2-4 is a different edge.

So after including 0,9,3, the edges that are still uncovered are:

Edges:

2-4 (5), 1-4 (2), 1-5 (7), 12-1 (8), 8-1 (9), 7-1 (16), 2-1 (17), 5-2 (12), 8-12 (4).

Wait, 8-12 is edge4. 8 is not in the cover, 12 is not.

Edge12-1: 12 not
