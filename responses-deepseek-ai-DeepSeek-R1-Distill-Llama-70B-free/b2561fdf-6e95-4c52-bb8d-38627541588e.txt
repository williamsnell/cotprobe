Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the coefficient of heat transfer for air flowing through a pipe. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my heat transfer equations, but let's see if I can work through this.

The problem states that air flows through a pipe that's 5 feet long with an internal diameter of 0.5 inches. The air is moving at a uniform speed of 80 feet per second. The pipe wall is at 210°F, and the air enters at 60°F. The pressure is atmospheric, which I think is around 14.7 psia or about 1 atm.

Wait, the question is asking for the coefficient of heat transfer, which I remember is often referred to as the convective heat transfer coefficient, h. The units are given in Btu/hr-ft²-°F, so I need to make sure my calculations result in those units.

I think the formula for convection heat transfer is Q = h * A * ΔT, where Q is the heat transferred, A is the surface area, and ΔT is the temperature difference. But wait, in this case, I don't have Q, so maybe I need another approach. Oh right, maybe I should use the concept of the Nusselt number, which relates to the convective heat transfer coefficient.

The Nusselt number (Nu) is equal to (h * D)/k, where D is the diameter and k is the thermal conductivity of the fluid. So if I can find Nu, I can solve for h.

But how do I find Nu? I remember that for forced convection in a pipe, the Nusselt number depends on the Reynolds number (Re) and the Prandtl number (Pr). The formula varies depending on whether the flow is laminar or turbulent.

First, I need to determine if the flow is laminar or turbulent. The Reynolds number Re is given by (V * D)/μ, where V is the velocity, D is the diameter, and μ is the dynamic viscosity of the air.

Wait, let's plug in the numbers. The diameter is 0.5 inches, which is 0.5/12 = 0.0416667 feet. Velocity is 80 ft/s. What about the viscosity of air? At what temperature is this measured? Oh, since the air is entering at 60°F, maybe I should use the properties at that temperature. Or perhaps use the film temperature, which is the average of the wall and fluid temperatures. The wall is 210°F, and the air is 60°F, so film temp is (210 + 60)/2 = 135°F. Maybe that's better because the properties near the wall would be at that temperature.

Wait, but I'm dealing with the viscosity. Let me check the viscosity of air at 135°F. I think the viscosity of air increases with temperature. At room temperature (around 70°F), air's viscosity is about 1.2e-5 lb/ft-s. At higher temps, it's higher. Maybe I can look up the value. Alternatively, I can approximate it.

Alternatively, I can use the viscosity at the bulk temperature (60°F), but I'm not entirely sure. Let me proceed and see.

Let me try to compute Re first. So Re = V * D / μ.

Wait, let's get all the units straight. V is 80 ft/s, D is 0.5 inches, which is 0.0416667 feet. So V*D = 80 * 0.0416667 ≈ 3.33333 ft²/s.

Now, the viscosity μ for air. At 60°F, which is about 15.5°C, the dynamic viscosity of air is approximately 1.3e-5 lb/ft-s. Wait, let me confirm that. At 20°C (68°F), μ is about 1.8e-5 lb/ft-s. Wait, maybe I have this wrong. Let me think. Oh wait, no, the dynamic viscosity of air is lower at lower temperatures. Let me double-check.

Wait, no, actually, the viscosity of gases increases with temperature. So at higher temperatures, μ is higher. So at 60°F, which is about 15.5°C, that's lower than 20°C. So perhaps around 1.3e-5 lb/ft-s? Or wait, maybe my numbers are off. Maybe at 20°C, it's 1.8e-5, so at 15°C, it's a bit lower, like 1.7e-5? Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the value at the film temperature of 135°F, which is about 57.2°C. Let me see: at about 50°C, the viscosity of air is approximately 1.95e-5 lb/ft-s. Wait, let me think—another approach: the viscosity of air can be approximated using the Sutherland formula, which is μ = 1.458e-5 * (T)^(1.5)/(T + 110.4), where T is in Kelvin. But maybe that's getting too complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look up the viscosity of air at 135°F. Let's see: 135°F is equal to 57.22°C. Let me try to find μ at that temperature. I found a source that says at 0°C, μ=1.71e-5; at 20°C, 1.80e-5; at 100°C, 2.07e-5. So at 57°C, it's somewhere between 1.9e-5 and 2.0e-5. Let's say approximately 1.94e-5 lb/ft-s. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe I should proceed with an approximate value.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use air properties at the bulk temperature, which is 60°F. So at 60°F, which is 15.5°C, the dynamic viscosity is about 1.7e-5 lb/ft-s. Let me proceed with that for now.

So Re = (80 ft/s) * (0.0416667 ft) / (1.7e-5 lb/ft-s) = (3.33333) / (1.7e-5) ≈ let's compute that.

3.33333 / 1.7e-5 = 3.33333 / 0.000017 ≈ Let's see, 3.33333 / 0.000017.

Well, 1 / 0.000017 is approximately 58823.5. So 3.33333 * 58823.5 ≈ let's compute 3 * 58823.5 = 176,470.5, plus 0.33333*58823.5 ≈ 19,608. So total around 196,078.5. So Re ≈ 196,000.

Wait, that's a very high Reynolds number. The critical Reynolds number for flow in a pipe is around 2300, so this is well into the turbulent flow regime. So I should use a turbulent flow correlation for Nusselt number.

The common Nusselt number correlations for turbulent flow in a pipe are the Dittus-Boelter equation and the Petukhov-Kirillov equation. The Dittus-Boelter equation is simpler and often used. It states:

Nu = 0.023 * Re^0.8 * Pr^n,

where n is 0.4 for heating (since the wall is hotter than the fluid, the air is being heated) and 0.3 for cooling. Wait, no, I think it's the other way around. Wait, no, the exponent depends on whether the fluid is being heated or cooled. For gases, where the temperature doesn't vary as much as with liquids, the effect is less pronounced, but I think the exponent is 0.3 when the fluid is being cooled, and 0.4 when heated. Wait, maybe I should double-check that.

Wait, the Dittus-Boelter equation is generally written as:

Nu = 0.023 * Re^0.8 * Pr^n,

where n = 0.4 when the fluid is being heated (T_wall > T_fluid), and n = 0.3 when cooled (T_wall < T_fluid). So in this case, since the wall is at 210°F and the air is entering at 60°F, the air is being heated, so n=0.4.

So I need to find Pr, the Prandtl number of air at the appropriate temperature. Again, should I use the bulk temperature or the film temperature? Since we're using the Dittus-Boelter equation, which is based on the bulk properties. Or wait, some sources say that the Prandtl number should be evaluated at the film temperature. I'm a bit confused here, but I think for this problem, since the temperature difference isn't too extreme, maybe it's acceptable to use the bulk temperature properties.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use the film temperature for evaluating all properties except for the density, which is taken at the bulk temperature. Hmm, but this might complicate things, as I'd have to compute the properties at 135°F.

Wait, perhaps I can proceed with the bulk temperature for simplicity, given that the problem doesn't specify. Alternatively, using the film temp might be more accurate.

Let me think. The film temperature T_film is (T_wall + T_bulk)/2 = (210 + 60)/2 = 135°F, which is 57.22°C. So evaluating the Prandtl number at this temperature.

The Prandtl number for air at around 57°C is approximately 0.703. I remember that for air, the Prandtl number is roughly around 0.7 across a wide temperature range, with variations. At room temperature, it's about 0.707, so maybe around 0.703 at 57°C.

Alternatively, let me think of the Prandtl number formula: Pr = μ * c_p / k, where μ is dynamic viscosity, c_p is specific heat at constant pressure, and k is thermal conductivity.

So I need the values of μ, c_p, and k for air at 135°F.

Let me try to find approximate values. Let's see:

At 135°F (57.22°C), μ (dynamic viscosity) is approximately 2.07e-5 lb/ft-s (I think I saw that earlier, but I'm not certain). Wait, wait, maybe I can use the following approach. At 60°F, which is about 15.5°C, the μ is around 1.7e-5 lb/ft-s. At higher temperatures, it increases. Wait, earlier I thought that at 57°C, μ is about 1.94e-5 lb/ft-s. So perhaps I'll take μ as 2.0e-5 lb/ft-s for simplicity.

The specific heat at constant pressure, c_p, for air is approximately 0.24 Btu/lb-°F. Wait, is that right? Let me think: specific heat of air is about 0.24 Btu/lb·°F at around room temperature, and it doesn't vary much with temperature. So I'll use 0.24.

The thermal conductivity, k, of air at 135°F. Hmm, at room temperature (70°F), k is about 0.014 Btu·hr⁻¹·ft⁻¹·°F⁻¹. At higher temperatures, it increases. Let me see: maybe around 0.016? I'm not very sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can look up a table. Wait, maybe for this problem, let's proceed with an approximate value.

Wait, let's say k is approximately 0.016 Btu·hr⁻¹·ft⁻¹·°F⁻¹ at 135°F.

So Pr = μ * c_p / k = (2.0e-5 lb/ft-s) * (0.24 Btu/lb-°F) / (0.016 Btu·hr⁻¹·ft⁻¹·°F⁻¹).

Wait, let me compute the units first:

μ is in lb/(ft·s).

c_p is in Btu/(lb·°F).

k is in Btu/(hr·ft·°F).

Wait, let me think about the units:

Pr = (lb/(ft·s)) * (Btu/(lb·°F)) / (Btu/(hr·ft·°F)).

Simplify numerator: (lb/(ft·s)) * (Btu/(lb·°F)) ) = (Btu)/(ft·s·°F).

Denominator: (Btu)/(hr·ft·°F).

So Pr has units of (Btu/(ft·s·°F)) / (Btu/(hr·ft·°F))) = (1/s) * (hr) ) = hr/s = 3600 s²? Wait, no, wait:

Wait, Btu/(ft·s·°F) divided by Btu/(hr·ft·°F) equals (1/(s)) * (hr) )= hr/s = 3600 s²? No, wait, 1/(s) * hr is (1/s) * 3600 s = 3600. So the Pr would have no units, which is correct.

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's compute the numerical value.

μ = 2.0e-5 lb/(ft·s).

c_p = 0.24 Btu/(lb·°F).

k = 0.016 Btu/(hr·ft·°F).

So Pr = (2.0e-5) * 0.24 / 0.016.

Compute numerator: 2e-5 * 0.24 = 4.8e-6.

Divide by 0.016: 4.8e-6 / 0.016 = 3e-4. So Pr ≈ 0.0003. Wait, that can't be right because I know Pr for air is around 0.7.

Wait, that's impossible. I must have made a mistake in the units somewhere. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the units for thermal conductivity. Let me confirm the units of k.

The thermal conductivity k is in Btu/(hr·ft·°F). So when I compute Pr = μ * c_p / k, the units are:

( lb/(ft·s) ) * ( Btu/(lb·°F) ) ) / ( Btu/(hr·ft·°F) ) )

So, let's break it down:

Multiply μ and c_p:

(lb/(ft·s)) * (Btu/(lb·°F)) ) = Btu/(ft·s·°F).

Divide by k, which is Btu/(hr·ft·°F):

(Btu/(ft·s·°F)) / (Btu/(hr·ft·°F)) ) = (1/(s)) * (hr/1) ) = hr/s.

Wait, that can't be, because Pr is dimensionless. So perhaps I made a mistake in the units of k. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the thermal conductivity k is in W/(m·K), but in imperial units, it's Btu/(hr·ft·°F). So perhaps I have the units correct, but the calculation is wrong.

Wait, let me re-calculate the numerical value.

Pr = (2.0e-5 lb/(ft·s)) * (0.24 Btu/(lb·°F)) ) / (0.016 Btu/(hr·ft·°F)).

Compute numerator: 2.0e-5 * 0.24 = 4.8e-6 lb·Btu/(ft·s·lb·°F) → simplifies to 4.8e-6 Btu/(ft·s·°F).

Denominator: 0.016 Btu/(hr·ft·°F).

So Pr = (4.8e-6) / (0.016) = 0.0003, but that's way too low. Because I know Pr for air is about 0.7, so I'm definitely making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the units for thermal conductivity. Maybe I should use k in different units. Alternatively, perhaps I used the wrong value for k.

Wait, let me check the units again. Thermal conductivity k is in Btu/(hr·ft·°F). Let me see if I can find a reference value for k at 135°F. Maybe I'm using the wrong value.

Alternatively, perhaps the dynamic viscosity μ is in the wrong units. Let me check that. Oh wait, dynamic viscosity μ is in lb/(ft·s) or lb-s/ft². Alternatively, sometimes it's expressed in centipoise, but that's in CGS units.

Wait, perhaps I should convert the units to something more manageable. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the specific values for air at 135°F.

Wait, maybe I can find the Prandtl number from a table. Let me think: for air at around 100°F, Pr is about 0.688. At 200°F, maybe 0.66. So perhaps at 135°F, Pr is about 0.68 or 0.70.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the properties at the bulk temperature, which is 60°F. At 60°F, the Pr is around 0.707.

Wait, perhaps it's acceptable to use Pr = 0.7 for this problem.

But then, if I use Pr = 0.7, then I can proceed.

So now, Re is about 196,000, which is turbulent flow.

So using the Dittus-Boelter equation: Nu = 0.023 * Re^0.8 * Pr^0.4.

So Re = 1.96e5.

Compute Re^0.8: Let's compute log(1.96e5) first. Log(1.96e5) = log(196000) ≈ 5.292.

So 0.8 * 5.292 = 4.2336. So 10^4.2336 ≈ 10^0.2336 * 10^4 ≈ 1.7 * 10^4 ≈ 17,000.

Wait, alternatively, 1.96e5^0.8 = (1.96^0.8) * (1e5)^0.8.

1e5^0.8 = (1e5)^(4/5) = (1e5)^(0.8) = (10^5)^(0.8) = 10^(5*0.8) = 10^4 = 10,000.

1.96^0.8: Let's compute that.

Natural log of 1.96 is about 0.672. Multiply by 0.8:
