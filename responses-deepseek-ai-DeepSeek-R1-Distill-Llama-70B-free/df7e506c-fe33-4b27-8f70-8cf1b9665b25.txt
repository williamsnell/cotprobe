Question:

A stack of 7 pennies has a height of 1 centimeter. Nick has a stack of pennies with a height of 4 centimeters. Which equation can be used to find the number of pennies, n, in Nick’s stack of pennies?

Options:

A: n = 4 ÷ 7
B: n = 4 + 7
C: n = 7^4
D: n =7÷4
E: n = 4^7
F: n =7–4
G: n =7+4
H: n = 4 - 7
I: n =7×4

Okay, so I've got this problem about pennies and their heights. Let me try to break it down. 

The question says that a stack of 7 pennies is 1 centimeter high. So, each penny must be contributing a certain height to the stack. I think I can figure out the height of one penny by dividing the total height by the number of pennies. So, 1 cm divided by 7 pennies would give me the height per penny. That makes sense because if each penny is the same thickness, then dividing by the number gives the per-unit measurement.

Now, Nick has a stack that's 4 centimeters tall. I need to find out how many pennies, n, are in his stack. Since I know the height per penny, I can probably use that to find n. 

Wait, so if each penny is 1/7 cm tall, then the number of pennies in a 4 cm stack would be the total height divided by the height per penny. That would be 4 cm divided by (1/7 cm per penny). Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so 4 * 7 equals 28. So n should be 28. 

But let me make sure. The problem gives us 7 pennies for 1 cm. So the ratio is 7 pennies per 1 cm. So for each cm, there's 7 pennies. So for 4 cm, it's 4 times 7, which is 28. Yeah, that makes sense.

Looking at the options, I need to find the equation that represents this. The equation is n equals 4 multiplied by 7, which is option I. 

Wait, let me double-check the options. Option I is n=7×4, which is the same as 4×7. So that's correct. 

Any other options that might fit? Let me glance through them again. Option A is 4 divided by 7, which would give a fraction, not a whole number, so that's probably not it. Option D is 7 divided by 4, same issue. Option E is 4^7, which is way too big. Option C is 7^4, also too big. Options B, F, G, H are all addition or subtraction, which wouldn't give the right number. So yeah, I is the correct choice.

The problem states that 7 pennies have a height of 1 cm, so the height per penny is \( \frac{1}{7} \) cm. To find the number of pennies, \( n \), in a stack with a height of 4 cm, we use the equation:

\[
n = \frac{\text{Total Height}}{\text{Height per Penny}} = \frac{4}{\frac{1}{7}} = 4 \times 7 = 28
\]

This corresponds to the equation \( n = 7 \times 4 \), which is option I.

Answer: I
