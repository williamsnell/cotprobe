Okay, so I've got this question about a legal precedent set in Larry P. v. Riles. I'm a bit rusty on my education law cases, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that Larry P. v. Riles was a case related to testing in schools, specifically about how certain tests were being used in a way that might discriminate against African American students. I think the case dealt with issues of racial bias in IQ tests or placement tests. 

Wait, so the question is about the precedent resulting from that case. The options are A through J. Let's look at each option and see which one fits.

Option A: Schools being held responsible for providing tests that don't discriminate based on race. That sounds relevant because if the case was about biased testing, the outcome might require schools to ensure their tests are non-discriminatory.

Option B: Guidelines for discipline in schools. I don't recall Larry P. being about discipline. Maybe that's another case, like Goss v. Lopez? So probably not B.

Option C: Use of race in college admissions. That sounds more like the affirmative action cases, such as Grutter v. Bollinger. So C isn't it.

Option D: Abolish corporal punishment. I think that's another case, maybe Ingraham v. Wright, which dealt with paddling but didn't outright abolish it. So D is probably not correct.

Option E: Free, appropriate public education for students with disabilities. That's the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), possibly from cases like Mills v. District of Columbia. So E isn't the result here.

Option F: Bilingual education. That might relate to Lau v. Nichols, which required schools to provide support for non-English speakers, but not sure about Larry P. So F is probably not it.

Option G: Equal funding for boys' and girls' athletics. That's Title IX related, like cases involving gender equality in sports. So G isn't right.

Option H: Standardized curriculum. I don't think Larry P. had anything to do with curriculum standardization. Maybe state laws or other cases, but not this one.

Option I: Schools providing lunch. That's more about school meal programs, perhaps not tied to a Supreme Court case I'm aware of. So I is unlikely.

Option J: Anti-bullying policies. Some cases deal with harassment, but I don't think Larry P. was about bullying. So J is probably not the answer.

So, circling back, the case was about testing and racial discrimination. The precedent would logically require schools to ensure their tests don't discriminate. That points to option A.

The precedent established in Larry P. v. Riles addressed the issue of racial discrimination in testing within schools. The case led to the requirement that schools must provide tests that do not discriminate on the basis of race. Among the options provided, the correct answer aligns with this outcome.

Answer: A
