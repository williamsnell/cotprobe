Okay, so I've got this question about Phineas Gage and his brain injury. I remember that Phineas Gage was a man involved in a pretty serious accident, right? He was working on the railroad, and an iron rod went through his head. I think this case is really famous in psychology or neuroscience because it showed how brain damage can affect behavior and personality.

The question is asking which part of his brain was damaged. The options are various brain structures: parietal lobe, occipital lobe, hypothalamus, cerebellum, hippocampus, corpus callosum, prefrontal cortex, thalamus, medulla oblongata, and temporal lobe.

Hmm. From what I remember, Phineas's accident involved an explosion causing a tamping iron to go through his skull. I think it went in one side and out the other. So it probably damaged both the left and right parts of the brain, but maybe more on one side.

Wait, the key here is that his personality changed a lot after the accident. He became more impulsive, couldn't make good decisions, and his emotional regulation was off. These functions are usually associated with the frontal lobe, particularly the prefrontal cortex. The prefrontal cortex is responsible for executive functions like decision-making, planning, impulse control, and social behavior.

So the iron rod likely damaged his prefrontal cortex. But I should double-check the details. I think the rod entered through his cheek and exited through the top of his skull, which would be near the frontal lobe area. So the prefrontal cortex would be the part affected.

Looking at the options, G is prefrontal cortex. So the answer should be G.

The accident involving Phineas Gage resulted in significant damage to his brain, particularly the prefrontal cortex. This region is crucial for executive functions such as decision-making, impulse control, and social behavior, which aligns with the personality and behavioral changes observed in Gage after the incident.

Answer: G
