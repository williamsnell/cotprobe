Okay, so I've got this question here about group behavior. The question is asking which term describes when like-minded groups take more extreme positions than the individuals in the group. Hmm, I remember from my psychology classes that there are several terms related to group dynamics. Let me think through each option to figure this out.

Option A: group polarization. I think this is when a group's decision becomes more extreme than the individual's initial positions. Like, if everyone is already leaning in a certain direction, the group's decision is even more so. That sounds familiar.

Option B: deindividuation. Wait, that's more about losing self-awareness in a group, like when people act more impulsively in a crowd. Not sure it's related to taking extreme positions.

Option C: group escalation. I'm not as familiar with this one. Maybe it's about increasing commitment to a decision, like in the escalation of conflict? Or maybe it's another term for group polarization. Not certain.

Option D: conformity pressure. Conformity is about going along with the group, but I don't think it specifically refers to becoming more extreme. It's more about aligning with the majority, not necessarily intensifying the position.

Option E: groupthink. Oh right, groupthink is when groups make irrational decisions because they value consensus too much. They might ignore alternatives and take bigger risks. But does it mean they become more extreme than individuals? I think groupthink can lead to more extreme decisions, but I'm not sure if it's the exact term for this phenomenon.

Option F: shared identity effect. This sounds like it's about group members identifying with each other, but I'm not sure how it relates to taking more extreme positions. Maybe it's a component of group polarization, but not the term itself.

Option G: group conformity. Similar to D, this is about individuals conforming to the group's norms. But again, it's more about alignment than extremity.

Option H: social facilitation. This is about performing tasks better when others are around. Not related to decision-making extremity.

Option I: social amplification. I'm not exactly sure, but it sounds like it could be related to how information spreads in a group, maybe making beliefs stronger. But I don't recall if this is the standard term for the phenomenon described.

Option J: collective bias. This seems general, like a shared tendency to make certain decisions, but not the specific term for the extremity shift.

Wait, so going back. The question is about groups becoming more extreme than individuals. I remember that group polarization is exactly that. When people with similar views discuss a topic, their views tend to become more extreme. For example, a group of conservatives might decide on even more conservative policies after discussion.

Groupthink is more about the process leading to bad decisions, not necessarily about extremity compared to individuals. So the correct answer should be group polarization, which is option A.

The term that describes the phenomenon where like-minded groups take more extreme positions than the individuals within the group is **group polarization**. This occurs when group discussions amplify initial tendencies, leading to more extreme decisions than those held by individuals beforehand. Other options, such as groupthink, refer to related but distinct concepts like irrational consensus-seeking, while terms like conformity or deindividuation describe different social phenomena.

Answer: A
