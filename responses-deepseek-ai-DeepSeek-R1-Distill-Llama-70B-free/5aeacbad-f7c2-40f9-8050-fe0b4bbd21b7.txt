Near the edge of the field, a woman was sitting in a beach chair and reading a book. The girl threw the ball too far, and it went over her friends' heads and flew toward the woman. Although the woman did not see the ball coming, it hit the straw hat that the woman was wearing, knocking it from her head. Although the woman was not touched by the ball, she was startled by the ball hitting her hat, and she fell from her chair and broke her arm. If the woman initiates a suit against the girl to recover damages for her broken arm, the woman will

Options:

Okay, so I have this question about tort law, specifically involving negligence and possibly other intentional torts. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is a girl playing catch with her friends in a park. She throws the ball too far, it goes over her friends and hits a woman's straw hat, knocking it off. The woman didn't see the ball coming, got startled, fell, and broke her arm. Now, the woman is suing the girl for damages.

I need to figure out if the woman can recover, and under what legal theory. The options are A through J, each suggesting a different outcome.

First, let's consider the elements of the possible torts involved. The main possibilities here seem to be negligence, battery, assault, or maybe both.

Negligence requires duty, breach, causation, and damages. Battery is an intentional tort that involves harmful or offensive contact with another person without consent. Assault is an intentional act that causes apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact.

In this case, the girl threw the ball, which hit the woman's hat. The woman wasn't touched by the ball, but the hat was. So, did that constitute a battery? Because the girl intended to throw the ball, but maybe not to hit the woman. If the girl didn't intend to hit the woman, then it's probably not a battery. But sometimes, even if you don't intend to hit someone, if you act in a way that's substantially certain to cause contact, it could be battery.

Wait, but the ball didn't touch the woman's person; it touched her hat, which she was wearing. So is the hat considered part of her person? I think in some cases, contact with something attached to the person (like clothing) can count as contact for battery. So if the hat was on her head, knocking it off might be considered a battery because it's contact with her person through the hat.

Alternatively, maybe it's not a battery because the ball didn't touch her body, only her hat. This is a bit tricky. I'm not entirely sure about that.

Next, let's think about negligence. The girl was playing catch, but she threw the ball too hard, causing it to go beyond her friends towards the woman. So, a duty of care exists when engaging in activities that could foreseeably harm others. Breach would be if she didn't exercise reasonable care. Throwing the ball in a way that it goes towards someone sitting nearby might be a breach. The cause here is the ball hitting the hat, which startled the woman, leading to her fall and injury. So causation seems clear. And damages are present because of the broken arm.

So for negligence, the elements seem to be met. The girl could be found negligent.

Now, could there be an assault? Assault requires an intentional act that causes apprehension of imminent harmful contact. Here, the ball was thrown and hit the hat. The woman didn't see it coming, so she didn't have apprehension before the contact. She was startled after the contact. So there's no apprehension of imminent contact before it happened. Therefore, assault might not apply here.

What about intentional infliction of emotional distress? That requires intentional or reckless conduct that's extreme and outrageous, causing severe emotional distress. I don't think this applies because the girl didn't intend to cause distress; she was just playing, and the act wasn't extreme or outrageous.

So, possible claims are negligence and possibly battery. But wait, for battery, the intent element is key. The girl didn't intend to hit the woman. She threw the ball to her friends but it went too far. So maybe it's a case of transferred intent? Transferred intent applies when the intent is directed towards one person, but affects another. But here, the intent was to throw the ball to her friend, not to hit anyone. So perhaps transferred intent doesn't apply.

Wait, but if the girl's action was negligent, leading to the contact, does that make it a battery? Or is battery only when the contact is intentional? I think battery requires intent to make contact, not just intent to perform the action that results in contact. So if she didn't intend to hit the woman, then it's not a battery. It might be negligence, though.

So putting this together, the woman could sue for negligence because the girl breached her duty of care, causing injury. But for battery, since there was no intent to hit the woman, it's not applicable. So the woman would recover for negligence only.

Looking at the options, option G says "recover for negligence only." Option J says both negligence and battery, but I don't think battery applies here. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused about whether the contact with the hat counts as contact for battery. Some sources say that contact with an item so closely connected to the person as to be part of their person (like clothing) can constitute battery. So maybe knocking the hat off her head could be considered battery. If that's the case, then both negligence and battery could apply.

In that case, the girl could be liable for both negligence and battery. So option J would be the correct answer.

But I'm a bit unsure. Let me think again. The intent for battery is intent to cause contact. If the girl didn't intend to hit the woman, but her action caused contact (through the hat), is that enough? Or is intent to hit someone required?

Ah, I think for battery, the intent is to cause contact, but it doesn't have to be intent to harm. So if the girl's throw was intended to go in a direction where it might hit someone, even if she didn't specifically aim at the woman, that could be intent to cause contact. But in this case, the girl was playing catch and threw the ball too far. She didn't intend to hit the woman; it was an accident. So maybe it's not a battery.

Alternatively, if the girl was reckless in her throw, knowing people were nearby, maybe that's enough for battery. But I'm not sure. Some courts might consider that reckless disregard as sufficient intent for battery.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. If the answer is that she can recover for both negligence and battery, then option J is correct. But if battery doesn't apply because there was no intent, then only negligence applies, making option G correct.

I think in this case, the girl didn't intend to hit the woman, so battery isn't applicable. Therefore, the woman can only recover for negligence. So the answer would be G: recover for negligence only.

The question revolves around whether the woman can recover damages from the girl under tort law, specifically considering negligence and intentional torts like battery and assault. Here's the analysis:

1. **Negligence**:  
   - The girl owed a duty of care while playing catch in a public area.  
   - She breached this duty by throwing the ball too hard, causing it to fly toward the woman.  
   - The breach caused the ball to hit the woman's hat, startling her and leading to her fall and injury.  
   - Damages are clear (broken arm).  
   - All elements of negligence (duty, breach, causation, damages) are satisfied, so the girl could be found negligent.

2. **Battery**:  
   - Battery requires an intentional act that causes harmful or offensive contact with another person.  
   - The girl did not intend to hit the woman; she was playing catch and threw the ball too far.  
   - While contact with the hat (a personal item) might be considered contact with the person, the lack of intent to cause contact makes battery unlikely.  
   - Therefore, battery does not apply in this case.

3. **Assault**:  
   - Assault requires an intentional act that causes apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact.  
   - The woman did not see the ball coming and was startled only after the hat was knocked off.  
   - Since there was no apprehension of imminent contact before the incident, assault does not apply.

4. **Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress**:  
   - This requires extreme and outrageous conduct intended to cause severe emotional distress.  
   - The girl's action was accidental and not extreme or outrageous, so this does not apply.

Given the analysis, the woman can recover for negligence only, as the elements of negligence are met, but battery, assault, and intentional infliction of emotional distress are not supported by the facts.
