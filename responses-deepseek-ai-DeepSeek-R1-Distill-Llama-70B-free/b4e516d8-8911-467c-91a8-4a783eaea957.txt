Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again.

The problem says that two equimolar solutions A and B, with equal volumes, are mixed together. The reaction is A + B → C. After 1 hour, A is 75% reacted. I need to calculate how much of A will not react after 2 hours for three different scenarios: when the reaction is first order in A and zero order in B, when it's first order in both, and when it's zero order in both.

Hmm, right. So the question is about chemical kinetics and reaction orders. I remember that the rate law depends on the order of the reaction. The rate is determined by the concentrations of the reactants raised to the power of their respective orders.

Let me break it down for each part.

Starting with part a: The reaction is first order in A and zero order in B. So the rate law for this would be rate = k[A]^1 [B]^0, which simplifies to rate = k[A]. Because anything raised to zero is 1, so [B] doesn't affect the rate here.

Since the solutions are equimolar and equal in volume, the initial concentrations of A and B should be the same. Let's say the initial concentration is [A]₀ = [B]₀ = C₀.

When they react, the stoichiometry is 1:1 for A and B. So the concentration of each will decrease by the same amount as the reaction proceeds. But wait, since the rate doesn't depend on [B], the concentration of B isn't affecting the rate. So even if B is consumed, as long as there's some left, the rate remains dependent only on [A].

Wait, but if the reaction is A + B → C, and both start at the same concentration, once one is exhausted, the reaction would stop. But in our case, after 1 hour, 75% of A has reacted. So let me think about the concentrations.

Let me denote the initial concentration as [A]₀ = [B]₀ = C₀. After time t, the concentration of A is [A] = [A]₀ - x, and [B] = [B]₀ - x.

But since the reaction is zero order in B, [B] doesn't affect the rate. So the rate is only a function of [A].

Wait a second, but if [B] is zero order, that means that as long as B is present, its concentration doesn't affect the rate. But once B is completely consumed, the reaction stops. So I'll have to check whether B is still present after 1 hour.

Let me calculate how much A and B are consumed. After 1 hour, 75% of A has reacted. So x = 0.75 [A]₀. So [A] = 0.25 [A]₀.

But since B is also consumed by x, [B] = [B]₀ - x = [A]₀ - x. Since x is 0.75 [A]₀, [B] = 0.25 [A]₀.

Wait, so [B] is 25% of its initial concentration. So it's not exhausted yet. So the reaction hasn't stopped. So the rate remains rate = k [A].

Wait, but for a first-order reaction in A, the rate depends on [A], so the kinetics would follow first-order integrated rate law.

The integrated rate law for first order is ln([A]₀/[A]) = kt.

Wait, but wait a second. Because the rate is only dependent on [A], and since B is in excess (well, not in excess, same initial concentration), but in this case, since [B] is the same as [A] initially, and the reaction is 1:1, they would be consumed at the same rate. But I'm not sure about that because the rate doesn't depend on [B].

Wait, no, because if the reaction is first order in A and zero in B, then the rate is just dependent on [A], so [B] can be anything above zero. So as long as [B] is present, the rate is determined by [A].

But in this case, the stoichiometry dictates that each mole of A reacts with a mole of B. So as A decreases, B also decreases by the same amount. Therefore, if the reaction is first-order in A, the rate is k[A], but [B] is decreasing as well because it's being consumed.

Wait, but if [B] is zero order, then even if [B] is low, as long as it's not zero, the rate remains the same. But in reality, once [B] hits zero, the reaction can't proceed further.

But in this problem, after 1 hour, [A] is 25% of initial, so [B] is also 25% of initial. So both are present. So the reaction hasn't stopped.

So for part a, the rate law is rate = k [A], and we can model it using the first-order integrated rate law.

Wait, but wait. Since the reaction is A + B → C, and both are being consumed, but the rate only depends on [A]. So the rate of disappearance of A is d[A]/dt = -k [A].

But because for every mole of A consumed, a mole of B is also consumed, but since the rate doesn't depend on B, the presence of B doesn't affect the rate. So [B] is just being used up as A is used up, but the rate is only based on [A].

So, the integrated rate law for [A] is ln([A]₀/[A]) = kt.

Given that after 1 hour, [A] is 25% of [A]₀. So [A] = 0.25 [A]₀.

Plugging into the equation:

ln(1/0.25) = k * 1 → ln(4) = k → k = ln(4) ≈ 1.386 per hour.

Now, the question is, what is the concentration after 2 hours?

Using the same equation: ln([A]₀/[A]) = k * 2 → ln([A]₀/[A]) = 2 * ln(4) → ln([A]₀/[A]) = ln(4²) → ln([A]₀/[A]) = ln(16).

So [A]₀/[A] = 16 → [A] = [A]₀ /16 → which is 6.25% of [A]₀.

Wait, so after 2 hours, 93.75% of A has reacted, so the amount not reacted is 6.25%. So that's 6.25%. Looking at the options, let's check the a) parts.

Option A has a) 6.26% which is approximately 6.25%. So that would be option A for part a.

Wait, but let me make sure. Because another way to think about it is that in first-order reactions, the half-life is constant. But wait, the half-life applies when the reaction is first-order. So the half-life t₁/₂ = ln(2)/k.

But in this case, k is ln(4), so t₁/₂ would be ln(2)/ln(4) = (0.693)/(1.386) ≈ 0.5 hours. So half-life is 30 minutes.

So after 1 hour, which is two half-lives, the concentration should be (1/2)^2 = 1/4, which is 25% left. That matches the given data. Then after 2 hours, that's four half-lives, so (1/2)^4 = 1/16 ≈ 6.25% remains. So yes, part a is 6.25%, which is approximately 6.26% when rounded, so option A for part a.

Now moving to part b: reaction is first order in both A and B. So the rate law is rate = k [A][B].

Since they start with equal concentrations and react in a 1:1 ratio, the concentrations of A and B will remain equal as the reaction proceeds. Let me denote [A] = [B] = C at any time t.

Because for every mole of A that reacts, a mole of B reacts. So [A] = [B] = [A]₀ - x.

So the rate equation becomes rate = k [A]^2.

Because [A] and [B] are equal, so rate = k [A][B] = k [A]^2.

The integrated rate law for a second-order reaction (since the overall order is 2) when the reaction is A + B → products with same initial concentrations is a bit different. Wait, I think the integrated rate law for this scenario is 1/[A] = 1/[A]₀ + kt.

Wait, wait. Let me think. For a second-order reaction where two different reactants are involved, each first-order, but same initial concentrations, the integrated rate law is 1/[A] = 1/[A]₀ + 2kt. Or is it 1/[A] = 1/[A]₀ + kt?

Wait, maybe I should derive it. The rate is d[A]/dt = -k [A][B]. But [B] = [A]₀ - ([A]₀ - [A]) ) → [B] = [A] (since [A] = [A]₀ - x, [B] = [B]₀ - x = [A]₀ - x = [A]).

So d[A]/dt = -k [A]^2.

This is a second-order differential equation in [A]. The integrated rate law for d[A]/dt = -k [A]^2 is 1/[A] = kt + 1/[A]₀.

So yes, correct.

Now, given that after 1 hour, [A] is 0.25 [A]₀. So 1/[A] = 1/(0.25 [A]₀) = 4/[A]₀.

So 4/[A]₀ = k *1 + 1/[A]₀ → 4/[A]₀ - 1/[A]₀ = k → 3/[A]₀ = k.

So k = 3/[A]₀.

Now, after 2 hours, t=2:

1/[A] = (3/[A]₀) *2 + 1/[A]₀ → 6/[A]₀ + 1/[A]₀ = 7/[A]₀ → [A] = [A]₀/7 ≈ 0.142857 [A]₀.

So about 14.2857% remains. So approximately 14.29%. Looking at the options, which option has b) around 14.3%?

Looking at the options:

Option A: b)14.3%

Option B: b)10.8%

Option C: b)15%

Option E: b)13.5%

So option A has b)14.3%, which matches.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations. After 1 hour, [A]=0.25[A0].

So 1/[A] =4/[A0]. 

At t=0, 1/[A0]. At t=1, 4/[A0]=1/[A0] + k*1 → k=3/[A0].

At t=2, 1/[A]=1/[A0] + (3/[A0]) *2 →1/[A0] +6/[A0] =7/[A0] → [A]= [A0]/7 → 1/7≈14.2857%, so yes, 14.2857%, which is approximately 14.3%. So part b is 14.3%, which is option A's part b.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A's a) is 6.26%, which matches our part a, and b) is 14.3%, which matches part b. Now, what about part c?

Part c: the reaction is zero order in both A and B. So the rate law is rate = k.

Wait, zero order in both, so rate is independent of [A] and [B]. So the rate is just k, a constant.

But wait, for zero-order reactions, the integrated rate law is [A] = [A]₀ - kt.

But wait, since it's zero order in both, but the reaction is A + B → C, with stoichiometry 1:1, we need to consider when either A or B is depleted.

Because once either A or B is completely consumed, the reaction stops.

In this case, initial concentrations are equal and same volume, so [A]₀ = [B]₀ = C₀.

As the reaction proceeds, [A] decreases as [A] = [A]₀ - kt, and [B] = [B]₀ - kt.

But when either [A] or [B] reaches zero, the reaction stops.

Wait, but in our problem, after 1 hour, 75% of A has reacted. So x=0.75[A]₀.

So [A] after 1hr is 0.25 [A]₀.

So from integrated rate law for zero order, [A] = [A]₀ - kt → 0.25 [A]₀ = [A]₀ - k(1) → k=0.75 [A]₀.

So k = 0.75 [A]₀ per hour.

Now, after 2 hours, [A] would be [A]₀ - k *2 = [A]₀ - (0.75 [A]₀)*2 = [A]₀ - 1.5 [A]₀ = -0.5 [A]₀.

Wait, that can't be, because concentration can't be negative. So that suggests that the reaction would stop when [A] reaches zero.

So when does [A] reach zero?

Set [A] = 0 → 0 = [A]₀ - kt → t = [A]₀/(k).

We have k=0.75 [A]₀ → t= [A]₀/(0.75 [A]₀) )= 1/0.75 ≈1.333 hours, which is 1 hour and 20 minutes.

So after 1.333 hours, A is completely consumed. So at t=2 hours, which is beyond that time, [A] would be zero.

Wait, but wait. Because both A and B are being consumed at the same rate (since rate is same for both, as the stoichiometry is 1:1). So when A is exhausted, B would have [B] = [B]₀ - kt = [A]₀ - (0.75 [A]₀ * t).

Wait, but wait. Let me recast it.

The rate is zero order, so the rate of consumption of A is d[A]/dt = -k, and same for B, d[B]/dt = -k.

So after time t, [A] = [A]₀ - kt, [B] = [B]₀ - kt.

The reaction stops when either [A] or [B] reaches zero.

But since [A]₀ = [B]₀, both will reach zero at the same time t = [A]₀/k.

From the given data at t=1, [A]=0.25 [A]₀ → 0.25 [A]₀ = [A]₀ - k*1 → k=0.75 [A]₀.

So t when [A] becomes zero is t = [A]₀/(k) = [A]₀/(0.75 [A]₀) )= 1.333... hours.

So at t=2 hours, which is beyond 1.333 hours, [A] would be zero.

Wait, but that can't be right because the problem states that after 1 hour, 75% of A has reacted. So in 1 hour, 75% reacted, leaving 25%.

If the reaction is zero order, the rate is constant, so in the next hour (from t=1 to t=2), another 75% would react, but that's impossible because only 25% is left. So that suggests that in the first hour, 75% reacts, but in the second hour, only the remaining 25% can react, but since the rate is constant, let me think.

Wait, no. Because the rate is zero order; the amount reacted per unit time is constant. So if in the first hour, 0.75 [A]₀ reacted, then the rate is 0.75 [A]₀ per hour. So in the second hour, another 0.75 [A]₀ would react. But [A] after 1 hour is 0.25 [A]₀. So in the next hour, reacting 0.75 [A]₀ is impossible because only 0.25 [A]₀ is left. So the maximum that can react is 0.25 [A]₀.

So from t=1 to t=1.333 hours, A would be completely consumed.

So the total time for A to be 100% reacted is 1.333 hours. So at t=2 hours, all A is consumed.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because in a zero-order reaction, the rate is constant. So if in the first hour, 75% of A is consumed, then the rate is (0.75 [A]₀)/1 hour = 0.75 [A]₀ per hour.

So after 2 hours, the amount consumed would be 0.75 [A]₀ *2 = 1.5 [A]₀, but that's more than the initial concentration [A]₀. That's impossible because you can't consume more than 100%. So that indicates that at some point before 2 hours, A is completely consumed, and the reaction stops.

So the time taken to completely consume A is t_complete = [A]₀ / rate = [A]₀ / (0.75 [A]₀) )= 1/0.75 ≈1.333 hours.

So at t=2 hours, which is 0.666 hours beyond t_complete, A is already zero. So after 2 hours, [A] = 0. So the amount not reacted is 0%.

Looking at the options, part c) in option A is 0%, which matches.

So for all three parts, a)≈6.25%, b)≈14.2857%, c)=0%. So the correct option is A: a)6.26%, b)14.3%, c)0%.

Looking at the given options, option A is: a) 6.26%, b)14.3%, c)0%.
