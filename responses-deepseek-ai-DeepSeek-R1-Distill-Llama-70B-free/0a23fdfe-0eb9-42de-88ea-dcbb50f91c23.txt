Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about snapdragons. I'm a bit rusty on my genetics, but let's see if I can work through this.

The question is about the phenotypic results when a pink flowered snapdragon is crossed with a white flowered one. So, first, I need to understand the genetics behind the flower colors.

From the problem statement: homozygous red (RR) have red flowers, homozygous white (R'R') have white, and heterozygous (Rr or maybe R'R?) have pink. Wait, wait, the notation might be a bit confusing here. Usually, uppercase letters are dominant, lowercase recessive. But in this case, the homozygous red is RR, and white is R'R'. So perhaps the alleles are R and R', where R is for red and R' is for white, with R being dominant. Because when the plant is heterozygous (R R'), it's pink. So, the dominance hierarchy must be R dominant over R', and the heterozygote is a blend, which is pink.

So the parents in this cross are a pink (R R') and a white (R' R'). Let me write their genotypes:

Pink is R R' (since heterozygous gives pink)
White is R' R' (homozygous recessive gives white)

So, when we cross them, each parent will contribute one allele. Let's think about the gametes each parent can produce.

The pink plant (R R') can produce two types of gametes: R and R'. Each with 50% chance.

The white plant (R' R') is homozygous, so it can only produce R' gametes. All their gametes are R'.

So the possible offspring will come from the combination of these gametes.

Let's list the possible combinations:

- Pink's R + White's R' → R R'
- Pink's R' + White's R' → R' R'

So each of these combinations is 50% chance.

Now, what's the phenotype for each genotype?

- R R' is heterozygous → pink
- R' R' is homozygous → white

So the possible phenotypes are pink and white, each with 50% probability.

Looking at the options, I need to find the one that gives 50% pink and 50% white.

Looking through the options:

Option J: (1/2) RR red (1/2) R' R' white → Wait, no. Because the parents are R R' and R' R'. The possible offspring are R R' (pink) and R' R' (white). So the phenotypic ratio is 50% pink and 50% white.

Wait, let's check the options again.

Option A: (1/2) R'R pink, (1/2) R' R' white → No, that's 50-50 pink and white. So this could be correct.

Option A says (1/2) R' R pink and (1/2) R' R' white. So if A is 50% pink and 50% white, that's matching our expectation.

But wait, looking at the other options. Option E is (3/4) R'R pink and (1/4) R' R' white. That's a 3:1 ratio, which doesn't fit. Option I is 50% RR red and 50% R R' pink. No, that's not the case because the other parent is R' R'.

Option F is 1/2 white and 1/2 red. No, because our cross can't produce any RR plants. Because the pink parent can only contribute R or R', and the white parent can only contribute R'. So RR can't happen unless the pink parent contributes R and the white contributes R, but the white is R' R' so can't contribute R. So RR (red) isn't possible in this cross.

Wait, wait, so the possible offspring are R R' (pink) and R' R' (white), each at 50%. So the phenotypes are 50% pink and 50% white.

Looking back at the options, which one matches that.

Option A: (1/2) R'R pink (1/2) R'R' white → So yes, 50% each.

Wait, but let me double-check the options. Maybe I misread any.

Option A says (1/2) R’R pink and (1/2) R’R’ white. That's correct for us.

Option J: (1/2) RR red and (1/2) R’R’ white. No, because as I thought, RR can't form. So J is incorrect.

So the correct option should be A.

Wait, but another thought: in the question, the white flowered plant is homozygous for white. So the genotype is R' R'. So when crossed with R R', the possible gametes are R and R' from the pink, and only R' from the white. So the possible offspring are R R' (pink) and R' R' (white), each 50%.

So yes, the phenotypic ratio is 50% pink and 50% white. So which option matches that?

Looking again, option A is 1/2 R’R pink and 1/2 R’R’ white. So that's the 50-50 split.

Alternatively, perhaps the notation in the options uses R and r instead of R and R'? Hmm, that's possible. Let me see.

Wait, in the question, the alleles for red and white are written as R and R', but perhaps in the options, they used R and r (lowercase). So R is dominant (red), r is recessive (white). Then, the genotypes for the parents would be different.

Wait, but the question says:

- Homozygous red have red flowers → so perhaps RR (homozygous dominant R)

- Homozygous white → so rr (homozygous recessive)

- Heterozygous → Rr, which is pink.

Wait, that makes more sense, perhaps. Because typically, in such cases, R is dominant, r recessive.

If that's the case, then the pink flower would be Rr. The white flower is rr.

So when you cross Rr (pink) with rr (white), the possible offspring would be:

Rr x rr

Rr can produce R and r gametes.

rr can only produce r gametes.

So the offspring:

R (from Rr) + r (from rr) → Rr

r (from Rr) + r (from rr) → rr

So each has 50% chance.

So phenotypically, Rr is pink (50%) and rr is white (50%).

So the phenotypic ratio is 50% pink and 50% white.

Looking at the options, if the notation uses R and r, which one would match.

Option A: (1/2) R’R pink (1/2) R’R’ white → Not sure about the notation. Maybe R’ is r?

Alternatively, looking for an option that gives 1/2 pink and 1/2 white.

Looking at option A, which is 1/2 R’R pink and 1/2 R’R’ white. If R’ is r, then R’R would be Rr, which is pink, and R’R’ is rr, white. So option A would be correct.

Wait, but what about option J? Option J is (1/2) RR red (1/2) R’R’ white. So in this case, if R’R’ is rr, then this would give 50% RR (red) and 50% rr (white), but our cross doesn't produce RR. So J is not correct.

Another option is option I: (1/2) RR red (1/2) R’R pink. No, because we don't get RR.

So back to option A: 1/2 R’R (pink) and 1/2 R’R’ (white). That matches our expected 50-50 split.

Wait, but looking at the options again:

Option A: (1/2) R’R pink (1/2) R’R’ white → So this would mean 50% pink and 50% white, which matches.

So the answer should be option A.

In snapdragons, the genetics of flower color is determined by two alleles: **R** (dominant, red) and **R'** (recessive, white). The phenotypes are as follows:

- **RR** or **R R'**: Pink (heterozygous)
- **R R'**: Pink (heterozygous)
- **R' R'**: White (homozygous recessive)

The question involves crossing a pink-flowered plant (**R R'**) with a white-flowered plant (**R' R'**). To determine the expected phenotypic results in the progeny, we analyze the genotypes and phenotypes of the offspring.

### Parent Genotypes and Gametes:
1. **Pink plant (R R')**: Can produce two types of gametes, **R** and **R'**, each with a 50% chance.
2. **White plant (R' R')**: Can only produce **R'** gametes (100%).

### Possible Offspring Genotypes:
- **R (from R R') + R' (from R' R') → R R'** (heterozygous, pink)
- **R' (from R R') + R' (from R' R') → R' R'** (homozygous, white)

Thus, the offspring will have a 50% chance of being **R R'** (pink) and a 50% chance of being **R' R'** (white).

### Matching with the Options:
- **Option A**: (1/2) R'R pink (1/2) R'R' white  
  This matches the expected phenotypic ratio of 50% pink and 50% white.

- **Option J**: (1/2) RR red (1/2) R'R' white  
  This is incorrect because the cross cannot produce **RR** (red) offspring, as the white parent (**R' R'**) cannot contribute an **R** allele.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option A**, as it accurately reflects the 50% pink and 50% white phenotypic ratio expected from this cross.
