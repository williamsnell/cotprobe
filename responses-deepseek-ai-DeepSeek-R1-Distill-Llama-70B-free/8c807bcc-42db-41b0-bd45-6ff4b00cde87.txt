Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question is about calculating the heat transferred when 250J of work is done on a system consisting of 1 mole of an ideal gas. Oh right, and it's at constant temperature, so ΔE is zero for the expansion of an ideal gas. Hmm.

Alright, I remember that the first law of thermodynamics is ΔE = Q - W, where ΔE is the change in internal energy, Q is the heat added to the system, and W is the work done by the system. Or wait, sometimes I've seen it written as ΔE = Q + W, depending on the sign conventions for work. Because sometimes when work is done on the system, it's positive, and when the system does work, it's negative. I think this is a point where I might get mixed up.

Wait, the problem says that work is done on the system, so the system is receiving work. In the formula, when work is done on the system, it's considered positive. So in the formula ΔE = Q + W, where W is the work done on the system. Or wait, maybe I should double-check. Another way: if the system does work on the surroundings, it's losing energy, so W would be negative. So maybe the correct formula is ΔE = Q - W, where W is the work done by the system.

In this problem, the work done on the system is 250 J. So in terms of sign conventions, if W is work done by the system, then work done on the system would be -W. So the first law becomes ΔE = Q + (work done on system) → but wait, maybe I should think in terms of ΔE = Q - W_system, but I'm getting confused. Let me clarify.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of it as: the work done on the system is positive. So if the system does 100 J of work (like expanding), then W would be -100 J. But in this case, the work is done on the system, so W is +250 J.

But wait, the question says that the system is an ideal gas expanding at constant temperature. Oh, right, for an ideal gas, the internal energy ΔE depends only on temperature. So if the temperature is constant, ΔE is zero. That's given in the question. So ΔE = 0.

So putting it into the first law: 0 = Q - W. Wait, but which sign convention are we using here? Because if W is the work done by the system, then when work is done on the system, W is negative. So let's see.

Wait, let's get this straight. The first law is often written as ΔE = Q - W, where W is the work done by the system. So, if the system does work (like expanding), W is positive. If work is done on the system, W is negative.

In this problem, work is done on the system, so W is -250 J. Because the system is having work done on it, so the system is gaining energy from the work.

So the equation becomes ΔE = Q - W. And ΔE is zero.

So 0 = Q - (-250 J), which simplifies to 0 = Q + 250 J. So Q would be -250 J.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is ΔE = Q + W, where W is the work done on the system. So if the system absorbs heat (Q positive) and work is done on it (W positive), then internal energy increases.

In that case, the equation would be 0 = Q + W → Q = -W. Since W is 250 J (work done on system), Q = -250 J. So heat is released from the system, meaning the system is losing heat.

Wait, but when a gas expands isothermally, it does work on the surroundings. Oh wait, no, in this problem, the system is the gas, and work is done on it. So perhaps the scenario is that the gas is being compressed, not expanding. Because if work is done on the system, like compressing it.

Wait, but the question says "expansion of an ideal gas" and that ΔE is zero. So perhaps I'm getting this mixed up. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the question says that the system is an ideal gas expanding at constant temperature, but in this case, the work done is on the system. Hmm, that seems contradictory. Because expansion usually means the system is doing work on the surroundings, so work done by the system is positive. But in this problem, the work is done on the system, so it's compression perhaps.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. The problem states that work is done on the system, but the setup is about the expansion of an ideal gas. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If the gas is expanding, it's doing work on the surroundings. So work done by the system is positive, which would mean work done on the system is negative. Hmm, perhaps the problem is a bit confusing.

Wait, let me read the problem again. "Calculate the heat transferred when 250J of work is done on a system consisting of 1 mole of an ideal gas. At constant temperature, ΔE = 0 for the expansion of an ideal gas."

Wait, that's a bit confusing. The system is being expanded (so work is done by the system?), but the work done on the system is +250 J, which would imply compression. Or perhaps the wording is off. Alternatively, maybe the work done on the system is 250 J, so the system is being compressed.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting that wrong. Let me clarify. When a gas expands, it does work on the surroundings, so work done by the system is positive. If the surroundings do work on the system, the system's work is negative. So if someone does 250 J of work on the system, that would mean work done by the system is -250 J.

But the problem says that the system undergoes expansion, which would mean that the system is doing work. So that's conflicting with the work done on the system.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the problem. Let me read it again.

The question says: "Calculate the heat transferred when 250J of work is done on a system consisting of 1 mole of an ideal gas. At constant temperature, ΔE = 0 for the expansion of an ideal gas."

Hmm, okay, so the system is expanding (so the system is doing work on the surroundings), and the work done on the system is 250 J? That doesn't make sense. Because if the system is expanding, the work done by the system is positive, so work done on the system would be negative. So perhaps the problem has a typo, or I'm misinterpreting.

Wait, no. Let's think again. Maybe the problem is that the system is expanding, but work is done on the system. That would be a compression. But expansion would require the system to do work. So perhaps the problem is that the system is expanding, but the work done on the system is positive. That seems impossible. Unless perhaps the work is negative.

Wait, perhaps I should set aside the confusion about expansion and just focus on the variables given. The problem says work is done on the system, so W (work done on system) is positive 250 J. And since the temperature is constant, ΔE is zero.

So using the first law, ΔE = Q - W (where W is work done by the system). Or is it W the work done on the system?

Wait, I think I need to clarify the sign conventions. Let me think of the first law as:

ΔE = Q + W,

where W is the work done on the system.

In that case, if W is positive, the system gains energy from the work.

Alternatively, another convention is:

ΔE = Q - W,

where W is the work done by the system.

I think it's the latter that's more common. So if W is the work done by the system, then when the system does work (expands), W is positive, and when work is done on the system, W is negative.

So in this problem, work is done on the system, so W = -250 J.

And ΔE is zero, so:

0 = Q - (-250 J) → 0 = Q + 250 J → Q = -250 J.

So the heat transferred is -250 J, which would mean that the system is losing heat to the surroundings. So the heat is negative, meaning the system is releasing heat.

Wait, but the system is expanding. In an isothermal expansion, the system does work, so it needs to absorb heat to keep internal energy constant (since ΔE=0). But that's when the system is doing work. So in that case, Q would be positive, heat is absorbed.

But in this problem, the work is done on the system, so the system is not expanding but being compressed. Or perhaps the problem is using a different convention.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the work sign. Let me think again.

If the system is expanding, the work done by the system is positive. So W (work done by system) is positive. So if W is 250 J, then the work done on the system is -250 J.

But the problem says that 250 J of work is done on the system, so W (work done by system) is -250 J.

So using ΔE = Q - W, and ΔE =0:

0 = Q - (-250 J) → Q = -250 J.

So the heat Q is negative 250 J, meaning heat is released from the system.

But wait, in an isothermal expansion, the system absorbs heat. But in this case, perhaps the system is being compressed, so it's releasing heat.

Wait, but the problem says the system is expanding. Or wait, no, the problem says the system is an ideal gas expanding at constant temperature, but the work done is on the system. That seems conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the system is expanding, so the work done by the system is positive, but the problem states that work is done on the system, which would be negative. So perhaps the problem is a bit confusing, but perhaps I should proceed with the given data.

Wait, perhaps the problem isn't saying that the system is expanding, but that the expansion is the process, so perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps I should just apply the first law with the given values, regardless of the process.

So, to recap:

ΔE = 0 (given, because it's an ideal gas at constant T).

Work done on the system is +250 J. So W (work done by the system) is -250 J.

So applying the first law: 0 = Q - (-250 J) → Q = -250 J.

So the heat transferred is -250 J, which would mean the system is losing heat. So the heat Q is -250 J.

Looking at the options, option C is -250 J. So the answer should be C.

To solve the problem, we use the first law of thermodynamics:

\[
\Delta E = Q - W
\]

where:
- \( \Delta E \) is the change in internal energy,
- \( Q \) is the heat transferred,
- \( W \) is the work done by the system.

### Key Information:
1. The system consists of 1 mole of an ideal gas at constant temperature. For an ideal gas, \( \Delta E = 0 \) when the temperature is constant.
2. The problem states that 250 J of work is done **on** the system. By convention, work done **on** the system is positive, while work done **by** the system is negative. Thus, \( W = -250 \, \text{J} \) (work done by the system).

### Applying the First Law:
Substituting \( \Delta E = 0 \) and \( W = -250 \, \text{J} \) into the equation:

\[
0 = Q - (-250 \, \text{J})
\]

Simplify:

\[
Q = -250 \, \text{J}
\]

The negative sign indicates that heat is **released** from the system to the surroundings.

### Final Answer:
The heat transferred is \( -250 \, \text{J} \), which corresponds to option **C**.
