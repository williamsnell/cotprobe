Question:

A resident lived in a house across the street from a small office building. One of the offices in that building was that of a criminal defense lawyer. The resident hated the idea of the lawyer's office being close to her home. She felt that it meant dangerous criminals were coming and going in her neighborhood. The resident spent a lot of time looking out her window, trying to figure out which people going in and out of the office building were criminals, and imagining what sorts of crimes they had committed. The resident eventually decided that she needed to drive the lawyer out of the neighborhood. She made a telephone call to the lawyer and said, "You are scum, and so are all of your clients. I know that you're conspiring to commit crimes with all those bad people you represent. The police should arrest you and put you in jail with your clients. " The lawyer was very upset by what he heard. If the lawyer asserts a claim for defamation against the resident based on the telephone call, he will most likely

Options:

A: succeed, because the resident's remarks were offensive and damaging to the lawyer's reputation.
B: succeed, because the lawyer found the remarks to be upsetting.
C: not succeed, because the resident's remarks were a matter of personal opinion rather than statements of fact.
D: succeed, because the resident's remarks falsely accused the lawyer of committing a crime.
E: not succeed, because the lawyer chose to continue his practice despite the resident's remarks.
F: succeed, because the resident's remarks constituted slander per Se.
G: not succeed, because the resident's remarks were made in a personal conversation, not in a public setting.
H: succeed, because the resident's remarks caused emotional distress to the lawyer.
I: not succeed, because the resident's remarks were not published or communicated to anyone but the plaintiff.
J: not succeed, because the resident has a right to express her feelings about the lawyer's profession.

Okay, so I've got this question about defamation, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's break it down step by step. 

First, the scenario: A resident lives across from a criminal defense lawyer's office. She doesn't like that the lawyer is there because she thinks criminals are coming to her neighborhood. She calls the lawyer and says some pretty harsh things. She calls him scum, says he's conspiring with criminals, and suggests he should be arrested and put in jail with his clients. The lawyer is upset and wants to sue for defamation.

So the question is whether the lawyer's claim would succeed. The options are from A to J, each giving a different reason.

I remember that defamation involves a false statement of fact that harms someone's reputation, communicated to a third party. There are two types: slander and libel. Libel is written, slander is spoken. Some statements are considered slander per se, which means they're so bad that damage is presumed.

Looking at the resident's statements: She says the lawyer is scum, that he's conspiring to commit crimes, and that the police should arrest him. These seem like they could be defamatory. But wait, are they statements of fact or opinions?

In defamation law, statements of opinion are protected, especially under the First Amendment. So if she's just expressing her opinion about him, that's not defamatory. But if she's making factual claims that are false, that's actionable.

Let's analyze each part of her statement. Calling him scum is definitely an opinion; it's a pejorative term but not a factual assertion. Saying he's conspiring with his clients to commit crimes is a factual claim. If that's false, that could be defamatory. Also, suggesting he should be arrested and jailed implies criminal activity, which is a factual assertion.

But wait, in the context of a personal phone call, does that matter? The resident is making these statements directly to the lawyer, not to anyone else. So the issue of publication arises. For a defamation claim, the statement needs to be communicated to a third party. If it's just between the two of them, there's no publication, so no defamation.

Wait, but in some jurisdictions, if the statement is made to the person themselves, it's not considered published unless it's communicated to someone else. So if the resident only told the lawyer, that might not count. But I'm not entirely sure about that. I think that for slander, the statement usually needs to be heard by someone else or communicated to a third party. So if it's just a one-on-one conversation, maybe there's no defamation.

Another angle is whether the statements are slander per se. Slander per se includes false accusations of criminal conduct, which would fall under that. But again, if the statement wasn't published to a third party, it might not matter.

Looking at the answer choices:

Option C says the remarks were a matter of personal opinion rather than fact. That could apply to parts of the statement but not all. The conspiracy part is a factual claim, so maybe C isn't the right answer.

Option D says the lawyer will succeed because the resident falsely accused him of a crime. That seems like it could be slander per se, but only if the statement was published. If it's just between them, maybe not.

Option I says the remarks weren't published or communicated to anyone but the plaintiff. That would mean no defamation because there's no third-party publication. So if the call was just to the lawyer, then no one else heard it, so no defamation.

Option F says it's slander per se. Accusing someone of a crime is slander per se, but again, it depends on publication.

So, putting it together: The key issue is whether the statement was published. If the resident only spoke to the lawyer, then there's no publication, so no defamation. Therefore, the lawyer wouldn't succeed.

Looking at the options, option I says the remarks weren't published or communicated to anyone but the plaintiff. So that would be the reason the claim fails.

Wait, but what if the statement was so severe that even without publication, it's actionable? No, I think publication is a required element. Without it, there's no claim.

So the correct answer is either I or C. But I think the main issue is publication, not whether it's opinion.

So the answer should be I: not succeed because the remarks weren't published to anyone else.

The question revolves around whether a lawyer can successfully bring a defamation claim against a resident who made derogatory statements during a telephone call. To succeed, a defamation claim requires a false statement of fact, publication to a third party, and resulting harm to reputation.

The resident's statements included calling the lawyer "scum," accusing him of conspiring with criminals, and suggesting he should be arrested. While some parts of the statement could be interpreted as factual assertions (e.g., conspiring to commit crimes), the critical issue is whether these statements were "published" to a third party. Defamation requires that the statement be communicated to someone other than the plaintiff. Since the resident's remarks were made directly to the lawyer in a private phone call, there is no evidence of publication to a third party. Without publication, the defamation claim fails, regardless of whether the statements were harmful or defamatory in nature.

Option I correctly identifies that the remarks were not published or communicated to anyone but the plaintiff, which is a fatal flaw in the lawyer's claim. Other options, such as whether the statements were opinions or constituted slander per se, are secondary to the lack of publication.

Answer: I
