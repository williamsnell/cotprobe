Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

Alright, we're mixing two solutions. One is calcium nitrate, Ca(NO3)2, and the other is sodium fluoride, NaF. Both are being mixed in equal volumes, 50ml each, to make 100ml total. The concentrations are given in molarity. The question is whether precipitation will occur, specifically if CaF2 will precipitate. The Ksp value for CaF2 is provided as 1.7 × 10^-10.

Hmm, I remember that precipitation happens when the ion product exceeds the solubility product (Ksp). So I need to calculate the ion product [Ca^2+][F^-]^2 and compare it to Ksp.

First, let's break down each solution. 

The Ca(NO3)2 solution is 5.0 × 10^-4 M. Since Ca(NO3)2 dissociates into Ca^2+ and 2 NO3^- ions, the concentration of Ca^2+ will be 5.0 × 10^-4 M. 

The NaF solution is 2.0 × 10^-4 M. NaF dissociates into Na+ and F^- ions, so the F^- concentration is 2.0 × 10^-4 M.

But wait, when you mix two solutions, the volume changes. So I need to adjust the concentrations for the total volume after mixing.

The initial volumes are 50ml each, so when mixed, it's 100ml. The concentrations will each be halved because the volume doubles.

So for Ca^2+:
Initial concentration = 5.0e-4 M in 50ml. When mixed, it becomes (5.0e-4) / 2 = 2.5e-4 M.

For F^-:
Initial concentration = 2.0e-4 M in 50ml. After mixing, it's (2.0e-4)/2 = 1.0e-4 M.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, when you mix equal volumes, the dilution factor is 2, so concentrations are halved, right. So yes, that's correct.

Now, the ion product Q is [Ca^2+][F^-]^2.

Plugging in the numbers:
[Ca^2+] = 2.5e-4 M
[F^-] = 1.0e-4 M

So Q = (2.5e-4) * (1.0e-4)^2.

Let me calculate that step by step. First, square (1.0e-4):

(1.0e-4)^2 = 1.0e-8.

Then multiply by 2.5e-4:
Q = 2.5e-4 * 1.0e-8 = 2.5e-12.

Wait, but wait, Ksp is 1.7e-10. So Q is 2.5e-12, which is less than Ksp. So the solution is unsaturated. Therefore, precipitation shouldn't occur.

Wait, but wait another thing. Oh, wait, the Ksp is 1.7e-10. Our Q is 2.5e-12, which is smaller. So Q < Ksp, which means no precipitation. So the correct answer would be that precipitation does not occur.

Looking at the options:

Option D says "Precipitation should NOT occur." That's what I think. So the answer should be D.

But wait, did I make any mistake in calculations? Let me double-check.

Concentration after mixing:

For Ca(NO3)2:
Molarity = 5.0e-4 M * 50ml / 100ml = 2.5e-4 M. Correct.

For NaF:
Molarity = 2.0e-4 M * 50ml / 100ml = 1.0e-4 M. Correct.

Ion product Q = [Ca^2+][F^-]^2 = (2.5e-4) * (1.0e-4)^2.

(1e-4)^2 is 1e-8. So 2.5e-4 * 1e-8 = 2.5e-12.

Ksp is 1.7e-10. Since 2.5e-12 < 1.7e-10, Q < Ksp, no precipitation. So yes, D is correct.

To determine whether precipitation will occur when mixing 50 mL of 5.0 × 10⁻⁴ M Ca(NO₃)₂ and 50 mL of 2.0 × 10⁻⁴ M NaF, we calculate the ion product \( Q \) for CaF₂ and compare it to the solubility product constant \( K_{sp} \). Precipitation occurs if \( Q > K_{sp} \).

1. **Determine the concentrations after mixing:**
   - The total volume after mixing is 100 mL. Since the volumes are equal, the concentrations of both solutions are halved.
   - For Ca²⁺: \( \frac{5.0 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{M}}{2} = 2.5 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{M} \).
   - For F⁻: \( \frac{2.0 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{M}}{2} = 1.0 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{M} \).

2. **Calculate the ion product \( Q \):**
   - \( Q = [\text{Ca}^{2+}][\text{F}^-]^2 \).
   - Substituting the values: \( Q = (2.5 \times 10^{-4}) \times (1.0 \times 10^{-4})^2 \).
   - \( (1.0 \times 10^{-4})^2 = 1.0 \times 10^{-8} \), so \( Q = 2.5 \times 10^{-4} \times 1.0 \times 10^{-8} = 2.5 \times 10^{-12} \).

3. **Compare \( Q \) to \( K_{sp} \):**
   - The given \( K_{sp} \) for CaF₂ is \( 1.7 \times 10^{-10} \).
   - Since \( Q = 2.5 \times 10^{-12} < K_{sp} = 1.7 \times 10^{-10} \), the solution is unsaturated, and precipitation will not occur.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**D: Precipitation should NOT occur.**
