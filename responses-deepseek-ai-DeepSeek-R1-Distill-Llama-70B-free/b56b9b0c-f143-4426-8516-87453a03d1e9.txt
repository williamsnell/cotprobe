Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the mean heat transfer coefficient for water flowing through a heated tube. Hmm, let's break it down. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The tube has an inside diameter of 1/5 inch. Wait, 1/5 inch is 0.2 inches, right? I think I should convert that to feet because the other units are in feet. Oh wait, wait, no, maybe inches to meters? Wait no, the velocity is in ft/s, so maybe I should stick with inches converted to feet. So 0.2 inches divided by 12 is 0.016666... feet. So ID is 0.0166667 ft.

The tube is at 90°F, and the water has a mean temperature of 55°F. So the temperature difference is 35°F, but maybe that's not directly needed here. The water's velocity is 1.5 ft/s. And the tube length is 4 ft.

I remember that the heat transfer coefficient (h) is calculated using some correlation, maybe the Dittus-Boelter equation. Oh right, that's for forced convection in tubes. The equation is Nu = 0.023 * Re^0.8 * Pr^0.33, where Nu is Nusselt number, Re is Reynolds number, and Pr is Prandtl number.

So I need to find the Reynolds number first. Reynolds number Re = (v * d)/ν, where v is velocity, d is diameter, and ν is kinematic viscosity. But what's ν for water at the mean temperature?

Wait, the water's mean temperature is 55°F. I need the properties of water at that temperature. Let me think, I remember that the viscosity of water varies with temperature. At around 60°F, I think the kinematic viscosity is about 0.00001 ft²/s. Wait, maybe I should look up the exact value. Alternatively, maybe I can approximate. Let's see, at 50°F, ν is around 0.000013 ft²/s, and at 60°F, maybe around 0.0000095. Since 55 is in between, maybe around 0.0000108? Or perhaps I should use a more precise approach.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the Prandtl number. For water, the Prandtl number varies with temperature. At around 50°F, Pr is about 3.5, and at 60°F, maybe around 3.0. So at 55°F, maybe Pr is around 3ish. Let's say approximately 3.05 or 3.0.

So, let's calculate Re. v is 1.5 ft/s, d is 0.0166667 ft.

Re = (1.5 * 0.0166667) / ν.

Wait, but I need the exact ν. Maybe ν for water at 55°F is about 0.0000106 ft²/s. Let me double-check that. Oh wait, perhaps it's 0.00001 ft²/s is for higher temperatures, like 60°F, and 0.000013 for 50°F. So 55°F would be in between. Maybe ν ≈ 0.000011 ft²/s. Let me think, perhaps I should use a more precise value. Maybe from a table. For example, at 50°F (about 10°C), ν is 0.00001307 ft²/s. At 60°F (15°C), it's 0.00000902 ft²/s. So for 55°F, which is about 13°C, maybe ν is around 0.0000105 ft²/s. Let's use that.

So Re = (1.5 * 0.0166667) / 0.0000105.

Calculating numerator: 1.5 * 0.0166667 ≈ 0.025. So Re ≈ 0.025 / 0.0000105 ≈ 2380.95. So around 2381. So the flow is turbulent since Re is above 2300.

Now, the Dittus-Boelter equation applies to turbulent flow. So using that:

Nu = 0.023 * Re^0.8 * Pr^0.33.

We have Re ≈ 2381, Pr ≈ 3.0 (since 55°F is around there).

So Nu = 0.023 * (2381)^0.8 * (3.0)^0.33.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute Re^0.8. 2381^0.8.

I know that 2381 is about 2.381e3. Let's use logarithms to approximate.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute using a calculator-like approach. Alternatively, I can remember that 2000^0.8 is about (2e3)^0.8 = 2^0.8 * 1e3^0.8 * (since 1e3 is 10^3, so 0.8*3=2.4, so 1e2.4 which is about 2511.886).

Wait, maybe I should compute 2381^0.8 numerically.

Wait, 2381 is 2.381 x 10^3.

Take natural log: ln(2381) = ln(2.381) + ln(1e3) ≈ 0.867 + 6.908 ≈ 7.775.

Multiply by 0.8: 7.775 * 0.8 ≈ 6.22.

Exponentiate: e^6.22 ≈ e^6 is about 403, e^0.22≈1.246, so 403 * 1.246 ≈ 502.3.

So Re^0.8 ≈ 502.3.

Now, Pr^0.33 is 3^0.33. Let's compute that.

3^0.33 is the same as e^(0.33 * ln3). ln3 is approximately 1.0986.

So 0.33 * 1.0986 ≈ 0.3627.

e^0.3627 ≈ 1.437.

So Pr^0.33 ≈ 1.437.

Now, Nu = 0.023 * 502.3 * 1.437.

Compute 502.3 * 1.437 first.

502.3 * 1.4 = 703.22.

502.3 * 0.037 ≈ 502.3 * 0.03 = 15.069, plus 502.3 * 0.007 ≈ 3.5161. So total ≈ 15.069 +3.516 = 18.585.

So 502.3 *1.437 ≈ 703.22 + 18.585 ≈ 721.805.

So Nu ≈ 0.023 * 721.805 ≈ 16.6.

Wait, 0.023 * 700 is 16.1, and 0.023*21.805≈0.501, so total ≈ 16.6.

So Nu ≈ 16.6.

Nusselt number is h * d / k, so h = (Nu * k) / d.

k is thermal conductivity of water. At 55°F, I think k is about 0.364 W/m·K. Wait, but wait, the units here are in feet, so maybe I should use k in Btu units.

Wait, thermal conductivity of water at around 55°F is about 0.364 W/m·K. Let me convert that to Btu·in/(hr·ft²·°F). Because the units for h are Btu/hr-ft²-°F.

Wait, 1 W/m·K = 0.5778 Btu·in/(hr·ft²·°F). So 0.364 W/m·K * 0.5778 ≈ 0.364 * 0.5778 ≈ 0.2099 Btu·in/(hr·ft²·°F). So k = 0.210 Btu·in/(hr·ft²·°F).

Wait, wait, maybe I got that wrong. Let me double-check the conversion.

The conversion factor for W/m·K to Btu·in/(hr·ft²·°F) is approximately 0.14422789 * 0.0000001? Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the units.

Alternatively, I think that 1 W/m·K = 0.57782 Btu·in/(hr·ft²·°F). So 0.364 W/m·K * 0.57782 = approximately 0.364 * 0.57782 ≈ 0.210 Btu·in/(hr·ft²·°F).

So k ≈ 0.210 Btu·in/(hr·ft²·°F).

But wait, the Nusselt number is h * d / k, so h = Nu * k / d.

Wait, d is in feet, and k is in Btu·in/(hr·ft²·°F). So we need to make sure the units match.

Wait, d is 0.0166667 ft = 0.2 inches. So perhaps it's easier to convert d to inches.

So d = 0.2 inches.

So h = (Nu * k) / d.

Plugging in the numbers: Nu≈16.6, k=0.210, d=0.2 inches.

So h = (16.6 * 0.210) / 0.2.

16.6 * 0.210 = 3.486.

3.486 / 0.2 = 17.43 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Wait, that can't be right because the options are all over 100. Did I make a mistake in units?

Ah, because I think I messed up the conversion of k. Let me try again.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use k in the correct units from the start.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the thermal conductivity of water at 55°F in Btu·in/(hr·ft²·°F).

Alternatively, perhaps I should find the correct value. Let me think, I remember that the thermal conductivity of water at around 60°F is about 0.38 W/m·K. But I need it in the right units.

Wait, another approach: the thermal conductivity of water at 55°F is approximately 0.364 W/m·K.

Let me convert that to Btu·in/(hr·ft²·°F).

I know that 1 W = 3.41214 Btu/hr.

1 m = 3.28084 ft.

So 1 W/m·K = 3.41214 Btu/hr / (3.28084 ft)·K.

But we're dealing with W/m·K to Btu·in/(hr·ft²·°F).

Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated. Let me try a different approach.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the formula with all the properties in consistent units.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula h = (k/d) * Nu, ensuring that the units for k are in Btu/(hr·ft²·°F·in).

Wait, because d is in inches. Alternatively, let me get the value of k in Btu/(hr·ft²·°F·in).

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck on unit conversions. Maybe I should find the correct value of k in the required units.

Let me think: 1 W/m·K = 0.57782 Btu·in/(hr·ft²·°F). So if k is 0.364 W/m·K, then in Btu·in/(hr·ft²·°F), it's 0.364 * 0.57782 ≈ 0.2103.

So k ≈ 0.2103 Btu·in/(hr·ft²·°F).

Now, h = (Nu * k) / d.

Nu is 16.6, k is 0.2103, d is 0.2 inches.

So h = (16.6 * 0.2103) / 0.2.

16.6 * 0.2103 ≈ 3.49.

3.49 / 0.2 = 17.45 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

But wait, this is way lower than any of the options given, which start at 100. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe I used the wrong formula. Oh wait, perhaps I should have used the Sieder-Tate equation instead, which is for constant wall temperature. The Dittus-Boelter is for constant heat flux.

Wait, the problem states that the tube is at a constant temperature, so the Sieder-Tate correlation is more appropriate. The Sieder-Tate equation is Nu = 0.027 Re^0.8 Pr^0.33 (μ/μ_wall)^0.14.

Wait, but wait, if the fluid properties are evaluated at the bulk temperature and the wall is at a different temperature, but in this problem, the wall is at 90°F, and the fluid is at 55°F. So I think I do need to account for the viscosity correction, which I didn't in the Dittus-Boelter approach.

Wait, so perhaps I should use Sieder-Tate, which includes the (μ/μ_wall)^0.14 factor.

Wait, but if I don't know μ_wall, the viscosity at the wall temperature, I can't compute that. Let me think. So, the wall is at 90°F, and the bulk is at 55°F.

The viscosity of water at 90°F is lower than at 55°F. So μ_wall is lower.

So, let's find μ at 90°F and at 55°F.

At 55°F, as before, μ (dynamic viscosity) is about 0.000011 poise? Wait, no, wait, kinematic viscosity ν is 0.0000105 ft²/s at 55°F, as calculated earlier. So dynamic viscosity μ = ν * density.

Wait, density of water at 55°F is about 62.0 lbm/ft³.

So μ at 55°F is ν * density = 0.0000105 ft²/s * 62 lbm/ft³.

Wait, dynamic viscosity in lbm/ft·hr. Since 1 ft²/s = (1 ft/s) * (1 ft) = (0.3048 m/s) * (0.3048 m), but perhaps better to convert ft²/s to lbm/ft·hr.

Wait, 1 lbm/ft³ * ft²/s = (lbm/ft³) * ft²/s = lbm/(ft·s). To convert to lbm/(ft·hr), multiply by 3600 s/hr.

So, μ at 55°F = 0.0000105 ft²/s * 62 lbm/ft³ * 3600 s/hr.

Wait, let me compute that:

0.0000105 * 62 = 0.000651.

0.000651 * 3600 ≈ 2.3436 lbm/(ft·hr).

So μ_bulk = 2.3436 lbm/(ft·hr).

Now, μ_wall at 90°F. The dynamic viscosity of water at 90°F is lower. Let me check, at 90°F, ν is about 0.000007 ft²/s (I think). Let me confirm. At 90°F, ν is around 0.0000074 ft²/s.

So μ_wall = ν_wall * density. Density at 90°F is about 60.0 lbm/ft³.

So μ_wall = 0.0000074 ft²/s * 60 lbm/ft³ * 3600 s/hr.

Calculating:

0.0000074 * 60 = 0.000444.

0.000444 * 3600 ≈ 1.5984 lbm/(ft·hr).

So μ_wall ≈ 1.5984 lbm/(ft·hr).

So the ratio μ/μ_wall = 2.3436 / 1.5984 ≈ 1.466.

So (μ/μ_wall)^0.14 = (1.466)^0.14.

Take natural log: ln(1.466) ≈ 0.382. Multiply by 0.14 → 0.0535.

Exponentiate: e^0.0535 ≈ 1.055.

So the correction factor is about 1.055.

Now, using Sieder-Tate equation:

Nu = 0.027 * Re^0.8 * Pr^0.33 * (μ/μ_wall)^0.14.

Wait, earlier I used Re ≈ 2381, Pr ≈ 3.0.

So Re^0.8 is same as before, which was approximately 502.3.

Pr^0.33 is 3^0.33 ≈ 1.437.

So Nu = 0.027 * 502.3 * 1.437 * 1.055.

Compute step by step:

First, 0.027 * 502.3 = approx 13.562.

Then, 13.562 * 1.437 ≈ let's see, 13 *1.437=18.681, 0.562*1.437≈0.808, total≈19.489.

Then, 19.489 * 1.055 ≈ 19.489 + (19.489 * 0.055) ≈ 19.489 + 1.070 ≈ 20.559.

So Nu ≈ 20.56.

Now, h = (Nu * k) / d.

Again, k is thermal conductivity in Btu·in/(hr·ft²·°F), which we found as 0.2103.

d is 0.2 inches.

So h = (20.56 * 0.2103) / 0.2.

20.56 * 0.2103 ≈ 4.324.

4.324 / 0.2 ≈ 21.62 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

Wait, that's still way lower than the options. So I'm definitely doing something wrong here. Let me think. Maybe I made a mistake in the Sieder-Tate equation.

Wait another thought: perhaps I should use the Dittus-Boelter equation without the viscosity correction because the problem doesn't specify the wall temperature's effect. Or perhaps I'm mixing up the equations. Wait, no, the Sieder-Tate is for constant wall temperature, which is the case here, so that's correct.

Wait, maybe my calculation of Re is incorrect. Let me double-check Re.

Re = (v * d) / ν.

v = 1.5 ft/s.

d = 0.0166667 ft.

ν at 55°F is 0.0000105 ft²
