Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an electric motor and calculating the current it requires and the electrical energy used. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The problem states: An electric motor is rated at 1 hp and operates from a 100-V line for 1 hour. I need to find the current it requires and the electrical energy expended. The options are A to J.

First, I remember that power in horsepower can be converted to watts because the formulas for electric power are in watts. Oh right, 1 horsepower is equal to 746 watts. So this motor is rated at 746 watts.

Power (P) in an electric circuit is given by P = V * I, where V is voltage and I is current. So to find the current, I can rearrange this formula: I = P / V.

So plugging in the numbers, P is 746 W, V is 100 V. Let's calculate that. 746 divided by 100 is 7.46 amperes. So the current should be approximately 7.46 A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is 7.46 A and 0.746 kW-hr. That looks promising. But let me double-check the other part about energy.

Energy expended is usually calculated in kilowatt-hours (kW-hr) because electricity bills use that unit. So first, I'll find the energy in watt-hours and then convert to kW-hr.

Power is in watts, so energy (E) is power multiplied by time. Time here is 1 hour. So E = P * t = 746 W * 1 hr = 746 Wh. Since 1 kW is 1000 W, 746 Wh is 0.746 kW-hr. So that matches the second part of option E.

But wait, is the motor 100% efficient? Because if it's not, then the input power would be higher. Oh, the problem says it's rated at 1 hp, so I think that refers to the mechanical power output. But wait, motors aren't 100% efficient; they lose some power as heat. But wait, the problem doesn't mention efficiency, so I think we're supposed to assume that the 1 hp is the input power. Or wait, noâ€”hp for motors can sometimes be the output. Hmm, that's a bit confusing.

Wait, no, when a motor is rated at a certain horsepower, that's usually the output power. So the input electrical power would be higher than that because of inefficiencies. But the problem doesn't give any efficiency, so maybe they're considering the input as 1 hp. Hmm, that's unclear.

Wait, let's think again. The problem says the motor is rated at 1 hp. I think the standard approach for such problems is to take the given power as the input unless stated otherwise. But wait, no, actually, when a motor is rated, it's usually for output. But since the problem doesn't mention efficiency, perhaps we're to assume it's 100% efficient, which isn't realistic, but maybe that's what's expected here.

Wait, but let's look at the options. Option E gives 0.746 kW-hr, which is exactly 746 Wh. Since the motor is 1 hp, which is 746 W, and it runs for 1 hour, the energy is 746 Wh, which is 0.746 kW-hr. So that would make sense.

But wait, if the motor's input power is 746 W, then the current is 746/100=7.46 A, which is what I calculated earlier. So that would point to option E.

But wait another thing: in real life, the input power would be higher than the output. For example, if a motor has, say, 80% efficiency, the input power would be higher. But since the problem doesn't give an efficiency, I guess we just proceed with the given data, assuming that the 1 hp is the power being used, perhaps the input.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of power consumption. So the motor is connected to a 100 V supply, and it's using 1 hp of power. So that 1 hp is the power being drawn from the line.

Wait, but the formula P=VI applies to the electrical input power. So if the motor is rated to consume 1 hp electrically, then that's 746 W. So current would be 746/100=7.46 A.

But if the 1 hp is the mechanical output, then the electrical input would be higher, but since no efficiency is given, perhaps the question treats 1 hp as the electrical input.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps the question is straightforward, and I'm overcomplicating.

Let me think again. The problem says the motor is rated at 1 hp and operates from a 100-V line. So the power consumed from the line would be 1 hp, which is 746 W. So the current is 746 / 100 = 7.46 A. The energy used in 1 hour is 746 Wh = 0.746 kW-hr. So the correct answer would be option E.

So looking at the options, E is 7.46 A and 0.746 kW-hr. That must be the correct choice.

To determine the current required by the motor and the electrical energy expended, we start by converting the motor's power rating from horsepower to watts. Since 1 horsepower (hp) is equivalent to 746 watts (W), the motor's power is:

\[
P = 1 \, \text{hp} = 746 \, \text{W}.
\]

The motor operates from a 100-V line, so the current it requires can be calculated using the formula:

\[
P = V \cdot I \quad \Rightarrow \quad I = \frac{P}{V}.
\]

Substituting \(P = 746 \, \text{W}\) and \(V = 100 \, \text{V}\):

\[
I = \frac{746}{100} = 7.46 \, \text{A}.
\]

Next, the electrical energy expended is calculated using the formula:

\[
E = P \cdot t,
\]

where \(t = 1 \, \text{hour}\). Substituting \(P = 746 \, \text{W}\) and \(t = 1 \, \text{hour}\):

\[
E = 746 \, \text{W} \cdot 1 \, \text{hour} = 746 \, \text{W-hr}.
\]

To convert this to kilowatt-hours (kW-hr):

\[
E = \frac{746}{1000} = 0.746 \, \text{kW-hr}.
\]

Thus, the motor requires a current of 7.46 A and expends 0.746 kW-hr of electrical energy. Comparing these values with the given options, the correct answer is:

**E: 7.46 A, 0.746 kW-hr.**
