Question:

Which of the following statements about the DNA in one of your liver cells is correct?

Options:

A: DNA in your liver cells contains genes unique to storing glycogen, while other cells do not contain those genes.
B: The DNA in your liver cells is only used for the production of liver enzymes.
C: The DNA in your liver cells is different from the DNA in your other cells.
D: Your liver cells contain the same DNA as your red blood cells, but not your white blood cells.
E: Most of the DNA in your liver cells will be transcribed but not translated.
F: The DNA in your liver cells only contains genes for liver-specific functions.
G: Your liver cells contain less DNA than your white blood cells.
H: Most of the DNA in your liver cells will be transcribed in the nucleus and translated in the cytoplasm.
I: DNA in your liver cells is primarily transcribed in the cytoplasm and translated in the nucleus.
J: Your liver cells contain the same DNA as your white blood cells.

Okay, so I've got this question about DNA in liver cells, and I'm a bit rusty on my biology, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is: Which of the following statements about the DNA in one of your liver cells is correct? The options are A through J.

Hmm. I remember that DNA is the same in all the cells of an organism, except for germ cells maybe. So liver cells, red blood cells, white blood cellsâ€”they all have the same DNA, right? Because they all come from the same zygote through mitosis. Unless there's something like gene editing or mutations, but that's not the case here.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: DNA in liver cells contains genes unique to storing glycogen, while other cells don't. Wait, that doesn't sound right. I thought that all cells have the same DNA. The difference is which genes are expressed. So liver cells would have the genes for glycogen storage, but so do other cells. They just don't use them. So A is incorrect.

Option B: DNA is only used for liver enzymes. No, that's not right. DNA contains all sorts of genes, not just enzymes. Plus, liver cells produce various proteins, not just enzymes. So B is wrong.

Option C: DNA in liver cells is different from other cells. No, I remember that's incorrect. All body cells have the same DNA. So C is wrong.

Option D: Liver cells have same DNA as red blood cells but not white. Wait, red blood cells in mammals lose their nucleus, so they don't have DNA. So liver cells have DNA, red blood cells don't. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Most DNA is transcribed but not translated. Hmm. Transcription is making RNA from DNA, and translation is making protein from RNA. But most of the DNA isn't transcribed. Like, in any cell, only a small portion of the DNA is actively being transcribed at any time. So E says most is transcribed but not translated. Wait, that might be confusing. If it's transcribed, it's made into RNA. Some of that RNA is for other purposes, like rRNA or tRNA, not mRNA. But most mRNA does get translated. So I'm not sure about E. Maybe E is incorrect.

Option F: DNA only contains liver-specific genes. No, that's wrong. DNA has all the genes, but only some are active. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Liver cells have less DNA than white blood cells. Wait, white blood cells, like all nucleated cells, have the same amount of DNA as liver cells. Unless the liver cell is undergoing something like mitosis where DNA duplicates, but normally, same. So G is wrong.

Option H: Most DNA transcribed in nucleus and translated in cytoplasm. Wait, in eukaryotic cells, transcription happens in the nucleus, and then mRNA goes to the cytoplasm for translation. But does most of the DNA get transcribed? No, only a small fraction is actively transcribed. So H might be incorrect because it says 'most' of the DNA is transcribed.

Option I: DNA transcribed in cytoplasm and translated in nucleus. No, that's backwards. Transcription is in nucleus, translation in cytoplasm. So I is wrong.

Option J: Liver cells have same DNA as white blood cells. Yes, that's what I was thinking earlier. All nucleated cells have the same DNA. So J is correct.

Wait, but what about liver cells and white blood cells? Both are somatic cells, so their DNA is identical. So J is correct.

Let me double-check. So the correct answer should be J.

The question asks which statement about the DNA in liver cells is correct. DNA is the same in all nucleated cells of an organism, as they originate from the same zygote through mitosis. This means that liver cells and white blood cells share identical DNA. Here's an analysis of the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. While liver cells express genes for glycogen storage, all cells contain these genes; the difference lies in gene expression.
- **B**: Incorrect. DNA is not limited to producing liver enzymes; it contains genes for various functions.
- **C**: Incorrect. DNA in liver cells is the same as in other nucleated cells.
- **D**: Incorrect. Red blood cells lack DNA, so liver cells do not share the same DNA with them.
- **E**: Incorrect. Only a small fraction of DNA is transcribed, not most.
- **F**: Incorrect. DNA contains all genes, not just liver-specific ones.
- **G**: Incorrect. Liver cells and white blood cells have the same amount of DNA.
- **H**: Incorrect. Only a small fraction of DNA is transcribed, not most.
- **I**: Incorrect. Transcription occurs in the nucleus, not the cytoplasm.
- **J**: Correct. Liver cells and white blood cells have the same DNA.

The correct answer is **J**.
