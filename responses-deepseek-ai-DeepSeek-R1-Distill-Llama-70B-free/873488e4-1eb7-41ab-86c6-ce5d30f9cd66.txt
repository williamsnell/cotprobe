Okay, so I've got this question here about what happens when a gas turns into a liquid. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the right one. Hmm, let me think about this.

Alright, I remember from science class that there are different processes involving phase changes. Phase changes are when a substance moves from one state of matter to anotherâ€”like solid, liquid, or gas. So, the question is about gas turning into liquid. 

Let me list out what each term means as I remember them. 

Sublimation is when a solid turns directly into a gas without going through the liquid phase. I think that's like dry ice turning into CO2 gas. So that's not gas to liquid, it's solid to gas. So option B is probably not the answer.

Condensation... wait, isn't that when a gas turns back into liquid? Like when water vapor in the air cools down and forms droplets, like on a cold window or in the fridge. Yeah, that sounds right. So condensation is gas to liquid. So option C might be the correct answer.

Deposition is another term. I'm a bit fuzzy on that. I think deposition is when a gas turns directly into a solid without going through the liquid phase. Like how frost forms on a window when water vapor freezes. So that's gas to solid. So A isn't the right answer here.

Solidification is when a liquid turns into a solid. That's freezing, right? Like water turning into ice. So D is the opposite of what we're looking for.

Fusion is the process where a solid turns into a liquid, like melting. So that's the opposite of solidification. E is not the one.

Precipitation... I'm not 100% sure. I think that's when a solid forms from a solution, like when a crystal forms or when it rains. Wait, when it rains, that's liquid falling, so maybe precipitation is when a liquid forms from vapor in the air, but I'm not certain. Or maybe it's more about solids forming in a solution, like how salt can precipitate out when the solution is concentrated. So maybe F isn't the right term here.

Evaporation is when a liquid turns into a gas. That's the opposite of what the question is asking. So G is out.

Dissolution is when a substance dissolves in a solvent, like sugar in water. It doesn't involve phase changes between solid, liquid, and gas. So H isn't relevant here.

Ionization is when a substance gains or loses electrons to form ions. That's a chemical change, not a phase change. So I is not the answer.

Vaporization is when a liquid turns into a gas. That can happen through evaporation or boiling. So J is the opposite process.

Putting it all together, the process where gas turns into liquid is condensation. So the correct answer should be option C.

The process by which a gas turns into a liquid is called condensation. This occurs when the gas cools down, causing its molecules to slow and come together to form droplets of liquid. For example, water vapor in the air condenses into water droplets on a cold surface.

Answer: C
