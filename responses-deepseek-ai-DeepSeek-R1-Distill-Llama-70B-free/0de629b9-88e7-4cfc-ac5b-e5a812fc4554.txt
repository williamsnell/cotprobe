Okay, so I have this physics problem here about the photoelectric effect. Hmm, I remember that the photoelectric effect has something to do with electrons being emitted from a metal surface when light shines on it. The question is about finding the longest wavelength of light that could produce the emission given certain energies.

The problem states that photoelectrons have a kinetic energy of 2 eV. The work function (W_f) of cesium is 1.8 eV. I need to find the longest wavelength of light that could have caused this emission.

Wait, I think the key equation here is Einstein's photoelectric equation. Let me recall it. Oh right, the equation is:

Kinetic Energy (KE) = Photon Energy (E_photon) - Work Function (W_f)

So KE = E_photon - W_f.

But wait, I think that's right. The energy of the incoming photon has to be at least equal to the work function for electrons to be emitted. And if the photon energy is higher, the excess becomes the kinetic energy of the electron.

So in this case, the KE is 2 eV. The work function is 1.8 eV. So plugging into the equation:

2 eV = E_photon - 1.8 eV.

So solving for E_photon: E_photon = 2 + 1.8 = 3.8 eV.

Wait, but wait a second. Because for the longest wavelength, that corresponds to the minimum energy photon needed. Oh wait, no, longer wavelength means lower energy. So the threshold wavelength is when the photon energy equals the work function. But in this case, the photon must have enough energy not just to eject the electron (work function) but also provide the kinetic energy. So in this scenario, the photon's energy is work function plus kinetic energy.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The photoelectric effect requires that the photon's energy is at least equal to the work function. The minimum energy (threshold) is when E_photon = W_f. But if the photon has more energy, the excess becomes KE. So in this problem, the photon's energy must be W_f + KE. So E_photon = 1.8 eV + 2 eV = 3.8 eV.

Now, I need to convert this energy into wavelength. I remember that the energy of a photon is related to wavelength by the equation E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light.

So I can rearrange that to find λ: λ = hc/E.

But wait, I need to make sure the units are correct. The energy here is in eV. So I should convert everything into compatible units.

I know that Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. The speed of light c is about 3.0 x 10^8 m/s. But since the energy is in eV, I might need to convert eV to joules or use a version of the equation that uses eV and nanometers.

Oh wait, another approach: I remember that 1 eV is equal to 1.602 x 10^-19 joules. But perhaps there's a more straightforward way. I think there's a conversion factor that relates eV directly to wavelength in nanometers.

Alternatively, I remember that hc is approximately 1240 eV·nm. So when E is in eV, λ in nm is hc/E.

So using that, λ = 1240 / E_photon.

E_photon is 3.8 eV. So λ = 1240 / 3.8 = let me calculate that.

1240 divided by 3.8. Let me compute that.

3.8 * 326 = let's see: 3.8 * 300 = 1140, 3.8*26=98.8, so 1140+98.8=1238.8. Oh wait, that's very close to 1240. So 3.8 * 326 ≈ 1238.8, which is almost 1240. So 326 nm would give approximately 3.8 eV. Wait, but since 326 *3.8 is 1238.8, which is just under 1240, so the actual wavelength would be a bit more than 326 nm. Let's compute it more accurately.

So 1240 /3.8 = ?

Let me do the division. 3.8 goes into 1240 how many times?

3.8 * 300 = 1140. Subtracting from 1240, 100 remains.

3.8 * 26 = 98.8. So 300 +26 =326, and 3.8*326= 1238.8.

So 1240 -1238.8 is 1.2. So 1.2 /3.8 = 0.315... So total is 326.315 nm. Approximately 326.3 nm.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps using calculator steps.

Compute 1240 ÷3.8.

Well, 3.8 × 325 = ?

3.8 ×300 = 1140.

3.8 ×25=95. So 1140+95=1235. So 325 *3.8=1235.

1240-1235=5. So 325 gives 1235. Then 5/3.8 is about 1.315. So 325 +1.315=326.315. So yes, approximately 326.3 nm.

Wait, but looking at the answer options, I don't see 326 nm. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: 450 nm

B: 350 nm

C: 375 nm

D: 327 nm

E: 265 nm

F: 300 nm

G: 250 nm

H:410 nm

I:290 nm

J:395 nm.

Wait, option D is 327 nm. Which is very close to our calculated 326.3 nm. So perhaps the answer is D.

But wait, the question is about the longest wavelength of light that could have produced such emission. The longest wavelength corresponds to the minimum energy required, which would be when the kinetic energy is zero. But in this problem, the kinetic energy is 2 eV, so the photon energy must be higher than just the work function.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the question says that the photoelectrons have kinetic energy 2 eV. So the photon energy is E_photon = W_f + KE = 1.8 +2=3.8 eV. So the wavelength we calculated is the threshold wavelength for this particular KE. So any longer wavelength would mean lower photon energy, which would result in lower KE.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The longest wavelength that can produce emission is when the photon has exactly enough energy to overcome the work function and provide the kinetic energy. So that's the threshold for this specific KE.

But wait, the maximum wavelength (minimum frequency) that can cause emission at all is when the photon's energy equals the work function. But when the photon has more energy, you get higher KE. So for a particular KE, the photon must have energy W_f + KE.

So the wavelength corresponding to that energy is the longest wavelength that could produce that KE. Because any longer wavelength (lower energy) would not provide enough energy to result in that KE.

So in this case, the calculation we did leads to approximately 326.3 nm, so 327 nm is the closest option, which is option D.

So the correct answer should be D:327 nm.

To solve the problem, we use Einstein's photoelectric equation:

\[
\text{Kinetic Energy (KE)} = \text{Photon Energy (E}_{\text{photon}}) - \text{Work Function (W}_f)
\]

Given:
- Kinetic Energy (KE) = 2 eV
- Work Function (W_f) = 1.8 eV

Rearranging the equation to find the photon energy:

\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \text{KE} + W_f = 2 \, \text{eV} + 1.8 \, \text{eV} = 3.8 \, \text{eV}
\]

The energy of a photon is related to its wavelength by the equation:

\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

Rearranging for wavelength:

\[
\lambda = \frac{hc}{E_{\text{photon}}}
\]

Using the convenient conversion factor \( hc \approx 1240 \, \text{eV·nm} \):

\[
\lambda = \frac{1240}{E_{\text{photon}}} = \frac{1240}{3.8} \, \text{nm}
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\lambda \approx 326.3 \, \text{nm}
\]

The longest wavelength of light that could produce the given emission corresponds to the calculated wavelength. Among the provided options, the closest value is:

**D: 327 nm**

Thus, the correct answer is:

**D**
