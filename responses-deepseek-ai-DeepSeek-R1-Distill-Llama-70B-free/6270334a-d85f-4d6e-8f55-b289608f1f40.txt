Okay, so I've got this question about interspecies interactions, and I'm supposed to figure out which option isn't one. Hmm, I remember that in ecology, there are several types of ways that different species interact. Let me think about each option.

First, the question lists four options: A is commensalism, B is succession, C is mutualism, and D is parasitism. The question is asking which one isn't a form of interspecies interaction. 

Wait, what's each term mean again? I think commensalism is where one species benefits and the other isn't really affected. Like how remora fish attach to sharks; the remora gets food, and the shark isn't really harmed or helped. So commensalism is definitely an interaction between species.

Mutualism, option C, that's when both species benefit. Like bees and flowers: bees get nectar, flowers get pollinated. So mutualism is a type of interspecies interaction too.

Parasitism, option D, is when one species benefits and the other is harmed. Like tapeworms in a host's intestines. The tapeworm gains, the host loses. So that's another interspecies interaction.

Now, what about succession, option B? Succession refers to the process of ecological change in a community over time. Like after a fire, the first plants to grow are grasses, then shrubs, then trees. It's more about how a community develops rather than interactions between different species. So succession isn't about how different species interact with each other; it's about the change in species composition in an area over time.

Wait, but can succession involve interactions? Like, maybe some species help others by changing the environment. But I don't think that's the main point. The key is that succession is a broader process, not a direct interaction between two species. So the question is about forms of interspecies interaction, which I think refers to direct relationships like mutualism, commensalism, parasitism, competition, etc. Succession isn't one of those direct interaction types; it's more about the sequence of community changes.

So the answer should be B: Succession, because it's not a form of interspecies interaction but a process of community development over time.

The question asks which of the given options is not a form of interspecies interaction. Let’s analyze each option:

- **A: Commensalism** is an interspecies interaction where one species benefits and the other is neither significantly affected nor harmed. For example, remora fish attaching to sharks. This is a direct interaction between species.

- **B: Succession** refers to the process of ecological change in a community over time, such as the development of plant species after a disturbance like a fire. While succession may involve interactions between species, it is not itself a direct form of interspecies interaction but rather a broader process of community change.

- **C: Mutualism** is an interspecies interaction where both species benefit, such as bees pollinating flowers while gathering nectar. This is a direct interaction between species.

- **D: Parasitism** is an interspecies interaction where one species benefits and the other is harmed, such as tapeworms living in a host’s intestines. This is also a direct interaction between species.

Since succession describes a process of community development rather than a direct interaction between species, it is not a form of interspecies interaction. 

Answer: B
