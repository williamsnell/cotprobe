Okay, so I've got this problem here about normal distribution. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. Alright, the question says that the mean is 50 and the standard deviation is 10. They want the probability that a randomly selected observation falls between 50 and 55. 

Wait, right, normal distribution problems usually involve z-scores. I remember that the z-score tells you how many standard deviations away from the mean a value is. The formula for z-score is (X - μ) / σ, where μ is the mean and σ is the standard deviation.

So, first, I'll calculate the z-scores for 50 and 55. Let's see, for 50, that's the mean, so z = (50 - 50)/10 = 0. Makes sense, the mean is at z=0. For 55, z = (55 - 50)/10 = 5/10 = 0.5. So the z-scores are 0 and 0.5.

Now, I need to find the probability that a value is between these two z-scores. I think I should use the standard normal distribution table for this. Wait, how does that work again? The table gives the cumulative probability from the left up to a certain z-score.

So, for z=0, the cumulative probability is 0.5 because the mean splits the distribution in half. For z=0.5, I need to look up that value. Let me try to remember the standard z-table values. Oh wait, I can think of some key points. For example, z=0.5 is somewhere around 0.6915 cumulative probability, but wait, no, that's the area to the left of z=0.5. Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up. Let me think again.

I think the z-table gives the area to the left of the z-score. So for z=0.5, the area is 0.6915? Wait, no, wait, I'm getting confused. Wait, another approach: from z=0 to z=0.5, that's the area between them. So I can subtract the cumulative at 0 from the cumulative at 0.5.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the cumulative up to 0.5 is the area from the left (negative infinity) up to 0.5. So the area between 0 and 0.5 would be the cumulative at 0.5 minus the cumulative at 0. 

So, the cumulative at 0 is 0.5. The cumulative at 0.5 is about 0.6915. So the area between 0 and 0.5 is 0.6915 - 0.5 = 0.1915. Wait, but looking at the answer options, I don't see 0.1915 exactly, but wait, option H is 0.191, which is close. So that's probably the answer.

Alternatively, maybe I should double-check the z-score for 55. Oh, yeah, that's correct, (55-50)/10=0.5. So that's right. So the area from 50 (z=0) to 55 (z=0.5) is 0.1915, which is approximately 0.191, so option H.

Wait, but let me think again. Another way to compute it is to find P(50 < X < 55) = P(X <55) - P(X<50). Since P(X<50) is 0.5, and P(X<55) is the cumulative up to z=0.5. So yeah, that's 0.6915 - 0.5 = 0.1915. So yeah, that's 0.191 approximately. So the answer should be H.

To solve the problem, we start by calculating the z-scores for the values 50 and 55 using the formula:

\[
z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}
\]

For \( X = 50 \):
\[
z = \frac{50 - 50}{10} = 0
\]

For \( X = 55 \):
\[
z = \frac{55 - 50}{10} = 0.5
\]

Next, we use the standard normal distribution table to find the cumulative probabilities corresponding to these z-scores. The table gives the area to the left of a given z-score. 

- For \( z = 0 \), the cumulative probability is \( 0.5 \).
- For \( z = 0.5 \), the cumulative probability is approximately \( 0.6915 \).

The probability that a value lies between 50 and 55 is the difference between these two cumulative probabilities:

\[
P(50 < X < 55) = P(X < 55) - P(X < 50) = 0.6915 - 0.5 = 0.1915
\]

This value rounds to \( 0.191 \), which corresponds to option H.
