Okay, let's tackle this thermodynamics problem. Hmm, the question is about a reaction that's nonspontaneous under standard conditions but becomes spontaneous at higher temperatures. I need to figure out what that means for ΔH, ΔS, and ΔG under standard conditions.

So, first, I remember that the spontaneity of a reaction is determined by the Gibbs free energy change, ΔG. When ΔG is negative, the reaction is spontaneous. If it's positive, the reaction is nonspontaneous. 

The reaction is nonspontaneous under standard conditions, so ΔG must be positive there. But when temperature increases, it becomes spontaneous, meaning ΔG becomes negative. 

I think the Gibbs equation is ΔG = ΔH - TΔS. At higher temperatures, the TΔS term must be influencing the value enough to make ΔG negative. Let's break that down.

Under standard conditions (which I assume is at a certain temperature, maybe 25°C), the reaction isn't spontaneous, so ΔG > 0.

At higher temperatures, it becomes spontaneous, so ΔG < 0. So, when T increases, the TΔS term must be significant enough to make ΔG negative. 

Wait, the equation can be rearranged as ΔG = ΔH - TΔS. For ΔG to become negative when T increases, the TΔS term must be larger and positive. Because if T increases and TΔS is positive, then subtracting a larger positive number from ΔH would make ΔG smaller. 

So, for TΔS to be positive, ΔS must be positive because temperature is positive. Because if ΔS is positive, then increasing T makes that term more positive, which makes the whole equation (since it's subtracted) ΔG = ΔH - (something larger). 

Wait, let me think again. Suppose ΔH is positive. If ΔS is positive, then at higher T, TΔS is larger. So the equation becomes ΔG = (positive value) - (larger positive value). That could make ΔG negative if TΔS is large enough. 

Alternatively, if ΔH is negative and ΔS is positive, but then the reaction would be spontaneous already at lower temps. So that can't be the case here because under standard conditions, it's nonspontaneous.

So putting it together: For the reaction to go from nonspontaneous (ΔG>0) to spontaneous (ΔG <0) when T increases, the equation implies that ΔH must be positive and ΔS must be positive. Because only then would increasing T make TΔS larger, overcoming the positive ΔH to make ΔG negative.

Wait, but let's double-check. The reaction is non-spontaneous at standard conditions (so ΔG >0). Let me write the possible cases.

Case 1: ΔH positive, ΔS positive.

At low T: ΔG = ΔH - TΔS. Since ΔH is positive, but TΔS is small (because T is low), ΔG is positive.

At high T: TΔS becomes larger, so ΔG could become negative.

Case 2: ΔH positive, ΔS negative.

Then at higher T, the TΔS term is more negative, so ΔG = ΔH - (negative) → ΔG becomes more positive. So the reaction becomes less spontaneous, which doesn't fit our scenario.

Case 3: ΔH negative, ΔS positive.

At any T, because ΔH is negative, and TΔS is positive, so ΔG would be more negative as T increases. But under standard conditions, it's non-spontaneous, so ΔG is positive. That would mean ΔH must be positive, because if ΔH is negative, even under standard conditions, ΔG might be negative. Hmm, maybe that's not the case.

Wait, let me think again. If ΔH is negative and ΔS is positive, then the reaction is spontaneous at all temperatures. Because both factors are favorable. So that can't be the case here because our reaction is non-spontaneous under standard conditions.

So back to our earlier conclusion: ΔH must be positive, and ΔS positive. Because that's the only way that when T increases, the TΔS term can make ΔG negative.

So under standard conditions, ΔG is positive, ΔH is positive, and ΔS is positive.

Looking at the options:

Option G says ΔH>0, ΔS>0, ΔG>0. That fits.

Other options: Let's see. Option B says ΔH>0, ΔS<0, ΔG>0. But in that case, increasing T would make TΔS more negative, so ΔG would be even larger positive, making the reaction more non-spontaneous. So that's not the case.

So the correct option should be G.

To determine the thermodynamic properties of the reaction under standard conditions, we analyze the given information: the reaction is nonspontaneous under standard conditions but becomes spontaneous at higher temperatures. The spontaneity of a reaction is governed by the Gibbs free energy change, ΔG, where:

\[
\Delta G = \Delta H - T\Delta S
\]

### Key Observations:
1. **Under standard conditions**, the reaction is nonspontaneous, so \(\Delta G > 0\).
2. **At higher temperatures**, the reaction becomes spontaneous, so \(\Delta G < 0\).

For the reaction to transition from nonspontaneous to spontaneous as temperature increases, the \(T\Delta S\) term must play a significant role. Specifically:
- If \(\Delta S > 0\), increasing \(T\) will make \(T\Delta S\) larger and more positive, which can overcome a positive \(\Delta H\), eventually making \(\Delta G < 0\).
- If \(\Delta S < 0\), increasing \(T\) would make \(T\Delta S\) more negative, causing \(\Delta G\) to become more positive, which contradicts the observation.

Thus, the reaction must have:
- \(\Delta H > 0\) (endothermic),
- \(\Delta S > 0\) (positive entropy change),
- \(\Delta G > 0\) under standard conditions.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: \(\Delta H = 0\), \(\Delta S > 0\), \(\Delta G > 0\). Incorrect, as \(\Delta H = 0\) does not align with the reaction becoming spontaneous at higher temperatures.
- **Option B**: \(\Delta H > 0\), \(\Delta S < 0\), \(\Delta G > 0\). Incorrect, as \(\Delta S < 0\) would make the reaction more nonspontaneous at higher temperatures.
- **Option C**: \(\Delta H > 0\), \(\Delta S = 0\), \(\Delta G > 0\). Incorrect, as \(\Delta S = 0\) implies no temperature dependence, contradicting the observation.
- **Option D**: \(\Delta H > 0\), \(\Delta S > 0\), \(\Delta G = 0\). Incorrect, as \(\Delta G = 0\) implies the reaction is at equilibrium under standard conditions, not nonspontaneous.
- **Option E**: \(\Delta H = 0\), \(\Delta S < 0\), \(\Delta G > 0\). Incorrect, as \(\Delta H = 0\) and \(\Delta S < 0\) do not match the observed behavior.
- **Option F**: \(\Delta H < 0\), \(\Delta S = 0\), \(\Delta G > 0\). Incorrect, as \(\Delta H < 0\) would make the reaction spontaneous even under standard conditions.
- **Option G**: \(\Delta H > 0\), \(\Delta S > 0\), \(\Delta G > 0\). Correct, as it aligns with the reaction being nonspontaneous under standard conditions and spontaneous at higher temperatures.
- **Option H**: \(\Delta H < 0\), \(\Delta S > 0\), \(\Delta G < 0\). Incorrect, as \(\Delta H < 0\) and \(\Delta S > 0\) would make the reaction spontaneous at all temperatures.
- **Option I**: \(\Delta H < 0\), \(\Delta S < 0\), \(\Delta G = 0\). Incorrect, as \(\Delta H < 0\) and \(\Delta S < 0\) do not match the observed behavior.
- **Option J**: \(\Delta H < 0\), \(\Delta S < 0\), \(\Delta G > 0\). Incorrect, as \(\Delta H < 0\) would make the reaction spontaneous under standard conditions.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option G**: \(\Delta H > 0\), \(\Delta S > 0\), and \(\Delta G > 0\) under standard conditions.
