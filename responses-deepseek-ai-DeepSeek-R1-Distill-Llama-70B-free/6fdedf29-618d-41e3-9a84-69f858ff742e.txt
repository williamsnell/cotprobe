Question:

A farmer owned a 40-acre tract of farmland located in a small southern town. The farmer leased the property and building thereon to a tenant for a term of seven years commencing on February 15, 2000 and terminating at 12:00 noon on February 15, 2007. The lease contained the following provision:"Lessee covenants to pay the rent of $5,000 per month on the 15th day of each month and to keep the building situated upon said leased premises in as good repair as it was at the time of said lease until the expiration thereof. " The lease also contained a provision giving the tenant the option to purchase 10 acres of the tract for $150,000 at the expiration of the lease term. Before the lease was executed, the farmer orally promised the tenant that he (the farmer) would have the 10-acre tract surveyed. During the last year of the lease, the tenant decided to exercise the option to purchase the 10 acres of the tract. Without the farmer's knowledge, the tenant began to build an irrigation ditch across the northern section of the property. When the tenant notified the farmer that he planned to exercise the option, the farmer refused to perform. The farmer also informed the tenant that he never had the 10-acre tract surveyed. If the tenant brings suit for specific performance, which of the following is the farmer's best defense?

Options:

A: The option was unenforceable because it was not included in the written lease.
B: The option agreement was unenforceable under the parol evidence rule.
C: The option to purchase was not exercised within the term of the lease.
D: The tenant failed to pay the full amount of rent as required by the lease.
E: The farmer's promise to survey the tract was an unfulfilled condition precedent to the tenant's right to purchase.
F: The farmer never consented to the tenant's exercise of the option.
G: The tenant's construction of an irrigation ditch constituted a material breach of the lease.
H: The description of the property was too indefinite to permit the remedy sought.
I: The farmer's failure to survey the 10-acre tract excused him from further obligations under the contract.
J: The option was unenforceable because it lacked separate consideration.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about contract law, specifically dealing with lease agreements and options to purchase. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question is about a farmer who leased land to a tenant with an option to buy 10 acres at the end of the lease. The tenant tried to exercise the option, but the farmer refuses. The issue is what the farmer's best defense is against the tenant's suit for specific performance.

First, I'll try to outline the facts as given:

- Lease term: 7 years, from February 15, 2000, to February 15, 2007, ending at noon.
- Rent: $5,000 per month, due on the 15th.
- Tenant must keep the building in good repair.
- Lease includes an option for tenant to buy 10 acres for $150,000 at the end of the lease.
- Before the lease was signed, the farmer orally promised to have the 10-acre tract surveyed.
- In the last year, the tenant decided to exercise the option and built an irrigation ditch without the farmer's knowledge.
- Tenant notified farmer of intent to exercise the option, but farmer refused and said he never had the tract surveyed.

The question is about the farmer's best defense against the tenant's specific performance suit.

I remember that specific performance is a remedy where the court orders a party to perform their contractual obligations, especially when monetary damages aren't sufficientâ€”like for real estate, where each property is considered unique.

So, the tenant is suing for specific performance to enforce the option. The farmer wants to avoid that. What's his best defense?

Looking at the options:

Option A: The option was unenforceable because it was not included in the written lease. Wait, but the lease did include the option provision. So this is incorrect because the option was in the written lease.

Option B: The option agreement was unenforceable under the parol evidence rule. Parol evidence rule applies when there's a written contract; prior or contemporaneous oral agreements are generally not admissible to contradict it. But the farmer's oral promise was about surveying, not the option itself. The option was in the lease, so parol evidence wouldn't apply to the option. So this option doesn't seem right.

Option C: The option to purchase was not exercised within the term of the lease. The lease ends on Feb 15, 2007. When did the tenant notify? The question says during the last year, so maybe before the lease ended. But the option is to be exercised at the expiration, so the tenant would have to exercise it by the end of the term. If the tenant tried to exercise it before the lease ended, maybe that's an issue. Alternatively, if the lease ended at noon on Feb 15, and the tenant notified on, say, Feb 16, that would be after. But the question says the tenant decided to exercise during the last year, which would be within the term. So maybe C is not the best defense.

Option D: The tenant failed to pay the full rent. The lease requires $5k/month. The question doesn't mention any failure to pay rent. So unless there's a breach on that, D might not apply. But the tenant did build a ditch without permission, which might be a breach, but that's covered in another option.

Option E: The farmer's promise to survey was an unfulfilled condition precedent. A condition precedent is something that must happen before a duty to perform arises. The lease's option doesn't mention surveying as a condition. The farmer's oral promise was before the lease was signed. But the option is part of the written lease, which doesn't include that condition. So the farmer's failure to survey might not affect the tenant's right to exercise the option. Unless the option was dependent on the survey, but the lease doesn't say that. So E might not hold.

Option F: The farmer never consented to the tenant's exercise. But the option is a unilateral right; the tenant can exercise it without the farmer's consent except as per the terms. So if the tenant properly exercised the option, the farmer's consent isn't needed beyond what's in the lease. So F doesn't seem like a strong defense.

Option G: Tenant's irrigation ditch was a material breach. The lease requires the tenant to keep the building in good repair, but doesn't say anything about alterations or improvements. Building a ditch might be a trespass or a violation, but is it a material breach? If so, the farmer could terminate the lease for breach, but does that affect the option? The option is a separate part of the lease. But if the tenant breached the lease, maybe the farmer can terminate the lease and the option along with it. But the question is about specific performance of the option, so the tenant's breach might allow the farmer to rescind the option. So G could be a possible defense.

Option H: Description too indefinite. The option is for 10 acres of a 40-acre tract. The farmer agreed to survey it, but didn't. If the description is too vague, maybe the option is unenforceable. But the lease includes the option, so maybe the description is sufficient. Also, the farmer's failure to survey doesn't necessarily make it indefinite if the lease describes it adequately. So H might not be the best choice.

Option I: Farmer's failure to survey excused him. The lease didn't make surveying a condition for the option. The farmer's oral promise isn't part of the written lease, so the tenant can't enforce that. So the farmer's failure to survey doesn't affect the option. So I doesn't work.

Option J: Option unenforceable due to lack of consideration. The option is part of the lease, which had consideration (rent). So the option doesn't need separate consideration because it's part of the same contract. So J is incorrect.

Now, reviewing, the possible options are C, G, and E.

Wait, the option was to be exercised at the expiration. If the tenant tried to exercise it before the lease ended, that might be a problem. The lease term ends on Feb 15, 2007. If the tenant exercised the option, say, on Feb 14, 2007, that might be within the term, but the option is exercisable at expiration. So maybe the tenant had to exercise it exactly at the end. If the tenant tried to exercise it before, then it's not within the term, making the exercise invalid. So option C says the option wasn't exercised within the term. If the lease ended at noon, and the tenant exercised it the next day, that's after, so C would apply. But the question says the tenant decided to exercise during the last year, which is within the term, but the option is exercisable at expiration. So maybe the tenant had to wait until the end. So perhaps C is the correct defense.

Alternatively, if the tenant breached the lease by building the ditch, option G would be the defense. But the lease's covenant is about keeping the building in repair, not about making improvements. The ditch is on the land, not the building. So maybe that's not a breach of the lease terms. So G might not be a strong defense.

So perhaps the best defense is C: the option wasn't exercised within the lease term. Because the option was exercisable only at the end, and if the tenant tried to exercise it earlier, that's a problem. Or maybe the tenant tried to exercise it after the lease ended, which would make it too late.

But the question doesn't specify exactly when the tenant notified the farmer. It just says during the last year, so perhaps before the lease ended. But the option is to be exercised at the expiration. So perhaps the tenant had to exercise it on or by the expiration date. If the tenant tried to exercise it before, then it's not yet exercisable. So the farmer can say the tenant didn't exercise it within the term because it was done before the term ended, but that might not make sense. Alternatively, if the tenant missed the deadline, that's a problem.

Alternatively, maybe the tenant did everything correctly, but the farmer can argue that the tenant's breach (the ditch) allows him to rescind the option. That would make G the correct answer.

Wait, but the lease doesn't prohibit the tenant from making improvements. The tenant's duty is to keep the building in repair. Building a ditch is an improvement to the land, which might actually be a benefit, but the farmer might argue it's a waste or trespass. But unless the lease prohibits it, the tenant might have the right as a tenant to make such improvements, especially if they're for farming purposes. So perhaps G isn't the best defense.

So going back, I think the best option is G: tenant's construction of the ditch was a material breach, allowing the farmer to terminate the lease and thus the option. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the strongest point.

Alternatively, maybe the option wasn't properly exercised within the term. If the tenant had to exercise it by the end of the lease, and he did so during the last year but before the expiration, then the exercise was premature, making it invalid. So the farmer can say the option wasn't exercised within the term, as per option C.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn between C and G. Another angle: the option is a separate agreement from the lease. If the tenant breached the lease, does that affect the option? Since the option is part of the lease, a material breach could forfeit the option. So if the tenant breached the lease, the farmer could terminate the lease and the option. So G would be the defense.

But does building a ditch without permission count as a material breach? The lease required the tenant to keep the building in good repair. The ditch is on the land, not the building. So perhaps it's not a breach of the lease terms. Unless the lease had a clause against making alterations without consent, which it doesn't mention here. So maybe the tenant didn't breach the lease, making G not applicable.

In that case, going back to option C, if the option had to be exercised exactly at the end, and the tenant tried to do it before, then the farmer can say it wasn't exercised within the term. But the question says the tenant decided to exercise during the last year, which is within the term. So maybe C isn't the right answer.

Wait, another thought: options to purchase in a lease are typically exercisable during the term or at the end. If the option is exercisable only at the end, the tenant has to exercise it by the end date. If the tenant tried to exercise it before, then it's not yet exercisable. But the lease ended on Feb 15, 2007, and the option was to be exercised at expiration. So perhaps the tenant had to exercise it on or after Feb 15, 2007. If the tenant tried to exercise it before, say in 2006, then it's invalid. But the question says the tenant notified the farmer when he decided to exercise. If that was before the lease ended, then the exercise was premature, making option C the correct defense.

So I think the best answer is C: The option to purchase was not exercised within the term of the lease.

Wait, but option C says "was not exercised within the term", but if the option was to be exercised at the expiration, then the exercise would be exactly at the end of the term. So if the tenant tried to exercise it before, it's not within the term. But if he tried to exercise it after, then it's too late. But the question says during the last year, which is within the term, but perhaps before expiration. So if the option can only be exercised at the end, then any exercise before wouldn't be valid. So the farmer can argue that the tenant didn't exercise it within the term because he tried before it was exercisable.

So option C would be the best defense.

The question revolves around a farmer's best defense against a tenant's suit for specific performance to enforce an option to purchase 10 acres of leased land. The lease included the option, which was exercisable at the expiration of the lease term. The tenant decided to exercise the option during the last year of the lease but did not notify the farmer until after the lease had ended. The farmer refused to perform, citing, among other things, that the tenant had not exercised the option within the lease term.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The option was included in the written lease, so it was enforceable.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The parol evidence rule does not apply to the option itself, as it was part of the written lease.
- **Option C**: Correct. The option was to be exercised at the expiration of the lease term. If the tenant attempted to exercise it before the lease ended, the exercise would be premature and invalid. The tenant's notification during the last year of the lease, but before its expiration, would not satisfy the requirement to exercise the option "at the expiration" of the term.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. There is no evidence in the facts that the tenant failed to pay the full rent.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The farmer's oral promise to survey the land was not a condition precedent to the tenant's right to exercise the option, as the lease did not make the survey a condition.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The tenant did not need the farmer's consent to exercise the option; it was a unilateral right under the lease.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The tenant's construction of an irrigation ditch was not a material breach of the lease, as the lease only required the tenant to keep the building in good repair, not to refrain from making improvements to the land.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The description of the property in the lease was sufficient to identify the 10-acre tract, so it was not too indefinite.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The farmer's failure to survey the land did not excuse him from performing the contract, as the lease did not make the survey a condition of the option.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The option was part of the lease, which had consideration (the rent), so separate consideration was not required.

### Conclusion:
The farmer's best defense is that the tenant did not exercise the option within the term of the lease. The option was to be exercised at the expiration of the lease, and the tenant's attempt to exercise it before the lease ended was premature and invalid.
