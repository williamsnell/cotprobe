Question:

A teenager is the star player on his high school basketball team. The high school is a public school, and the school has a policy that all student athletes are required to sign an authorization form by which they consent to undergo random drug testing. All the basketball players on the school team, except the teenager, signed the authorization. In the third game of the season, the team beat their archrival, and the teenager scored a record high 69 points. In the locker room following the game, the basketball coach approached the teenager and requested that he provide a urine sample for a random drug test. The teenager refused. He had smoked some marijuana the previous day and was afraid that a positive test result might jeopardize his being awarded a basketball scholarship to college. Thereafter, the teenager was suspended from the team for failing to comply with the coach's request. The coach later admitted that he did not have any individualized suspicion that the teenager was under the influence of drugs. The teenager has filed a motion challenging the suspension and seeking reinstatement on the basketball team. The court will most likely rule in favor of

Options:

A: the school, because drug testing is not an intrusion on his Fourth Amendment right of privacy.
B: the school, because the student is a public figure and therefore has less expectation of privacy.
C: the student, because the coach admitted that he did not have any individualized suspicion that the student was under the influence of drugs.
D: the school, because the student's drug use is a risk to his health and the safety of others.
E: the school, because a urine sample does not constitute a search under the Fourth Amendment.
F: the student, because the school's policy of random drug testing is not enforceable.
G: the student, because the school's policy of random drug testing is a violation of his civil rights.
H: the student, because the school did not have a legitimate reason to suspect him of drug use.
I: the student, because he didn't consent to the drug test.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about a high school student being suspended for refusing a drug test. Let me break it down step by step.

The scenario is about a teenager who's the star basketball player. His school has a policy where all student athletes must sign an authorization for random drug testing. Everyone on the team signed except him. Then, after a big game where he scored a lot, the coach asked him for a urine sample. He refused because he smoked marijuana the day before and is worried about losing a scholarship. The coach admitted he didn't have any suspicion about drug use. Now the student is challenging his suspension.

The question is whether the court will side with the school or the student. The options are from A to J, but focusing on the given options, I think the key here is understanding Fourth Amendment rights, especially in a school setting.

I remember that the Supreme Court has ruled on student drug testing. There's a case called Vernonia School District v. Acton (1995), where the Court upheld random drug testing for student athletes. The reasoning was that students have a reduced expectation of privacy in schools, and the testing was meant to prevent drug use that could affect safety in sports.

In this scenario, the school's policy requires all athletes to consent to random testing. The student didn't sign, which might be an issue. But when the coach asked him to take the test, he refused. The coach didn't have individual suspicion, which in some cases is required, but in the Vernonia case, random testing without suspicion was allowed for athletes.

So the policy seems to fit within the legal precedent. The student's refusal would then be a violation of school policy, leading to suspension. Even though he didn't sign the authorization form, the policy might still require compliance as a condition of participation.

Wait, but the student didn't sign the form. Does that matter? The question states that all except him signed. So maybe he's not bound by the policy. But if the policy is a school-wide rule for athletes, perhaps his participation makes him subject to it regardless of signing. Or maybe the school can enforce it as a condition of playing sports.

Another angle is the Fourth Amendment. Drug testing is considered a search, so it needs to be reasonable. The Vernonia case said that for student athletes, the privacy intrusion is minimal because they have less expectation of privacy, and the testing serves a legitimate purpose.

So even without individualized suspicion, the school can test if it's part of a random program. The student's refusal would mean he's not complying with the policy, so the suspension is justified.

Wait, but the student didn't sign the form. Does that make the testing involuntary? Or does the school's authority allow them to require it regardless? I think the court would likely say that as a condition of participating in extracurricular activities, especially sports, the student must comply with the drug testing policy, even if he didn't sign, because he's participating in the team.

So the school's policy is legal under Vernonia, and the student's refusal is a violation. Therefore, the court would rule in favor of the school.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the school wins because drug testing isn't a privacy intrusion. But that's not accurate because drug testing is a search, but it's allowed under certain conditions.

Option C says the student wins because there's no individualized suspicion. But Vernonia allows random testing without suspicion for athletes.

Option I says the student wins because he didn't consent. If the policy requires consent, but he didn't sign, does that matter? Or does participation imply consent? Maybe the school's policy is enforceable regardless of signing because it's a condition.

Wait, the school's policy requires signing an authorization. He didn't sign, but he's on the team. So does that mean the coach can't request the test? Or does the policy apply regardless?

Hmm, that's a bit confusing. If the authorization is required, and he didn't sign, maybe the school can't compel him. But the question says all the players except him signed. So perhaps he's not authorized, but the school's policy might still require testing as a condition of participation, regardless of the form.

Alternatively, maybe the form is a condition, so without signing, he's not subject to testing. But then, the school might argue that by participating, he's agreeing to the terms.

I think the key point is that the Supreme Court in Vernonia allowed random testing without individualized suspicion for athletes. So even if he didn't sign, the policy is legal. Therefore, the school can enforce it, and his refusal leads to suspension.

So the correct answer would be either A, but wait, option A says drug testing is not an intrusion, which isn't correct because it is a search but allowed. So maybe the correct answer is not A.

Looking again, option C says the student wins because no individualized suspicion. But under Vernonia, random testing is allowed without suspicion. So option C is wrong.

Option I: the student didn't consent. But under Vernonia, the school can impose drug testing as a condition for participation in sports, so even without his consent, it's allowed.

Wait, but the policy requires signing the authorization. If he didn't sign, can the school still test him? Maybe the form is part of the policy, so without signing, he's not part of the program. But he's on the team, so perhaps the form is a necessary part of participation. If he didn't sign, maybe the school can't test him, but can they suspend him for refusing to comply with the policy?

This is getting a bit tangled. Let me think about the implications. The school's policy requires the form; he didn't sign. So perhaps he's not subject to random testing. But the coach asked him anyway. So the question is whether the school can enforce the test when the student didn't sign.

Alternatively, perhaps the policy is that all athletes are subject to testing regardless of the form. But that seems unlikely because the question says they're required to sign the authorization.

So if he didn't sign, the school can't compel him to take the test. Therefore, his refusal might not be grounds for suspension, and the court would side with him.

Wait, that would mean option C or I.

Option C says the student wins because no individualized suspicion. But the issue might be more about consent than suspicion. Since he didn't sign, the school can't test him, so his refusal is valid.

So the school's policy requires signing the form. He didn't sign, so they can't make him take the test. Therefore, the suspension was improper, and the court rules for the student.

That would point to option I: the student, because he didn't consent.

Alternatively, if the policy is a condition of participation, perhaps his presence on the team implies consent. But the question says he didn't sign, so maybe he didn't consent.

So in that case, the school cannot compel him to take the test without his consent, so his refusal is justified, and the suspension is invalid.

So the court would rule in favor of the student, making option I correct.

But wait, in Vernonia, the school didn't require individual consent beyond participating in the sport. So maybe the form is just a part of the policy, but the legal basis is the school's authority. So even without the form, the testing can be done.

I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to recall: in Vernonia, the Court held that the school's policy of drug testing student athletes was constitutional without individualized suspicion because the students have a diminished expectation of privacy due to being in a school setting and participating in sports, which may involve risks. So the school can impose drug testing as a condition to play sports, regardless of whether the student signed a specific form.

In this case, if the school's policy is that all athletes must submit to random testing, and he's an athlete, then he's subject to the policy whether he signed or not. Because the form is part of the policy, but his participation makes him subject to it.

Wait, the question says all the other players signed the authorization. So perhaps the form is a standard part of the policy, but he didn't sign. So the school can't enforce the testing on him because he didn't consent. But the school might argue that by being on the team, he's subject to the policy regardless.

This is a bit tricky. If the policy requires signing the form, and he didn't, then the school can't test him. So the coach's request was invalid, and his refusal was justified. Therefore, the court would rule for the student.

So in that case, the correct answer would be option I: the student, because he didn't consent.

But I'm not entirely sure because the Vernonia case allows the school to test without individual consent as a condition of participation. So maybe the form is just a procedural step, but the underlying policy is enforceable.

Alternatively, perhaps the form is necessary for the school to have the authority to test. Without it, they can't compel the test.

So, in this case, since he didn't sign the form, the school can't make him take the test. Therefore, his suspension was wrong, and the court rules for him.

Thus, the answer should be option I.

The question revolves around whether a high school can compel a student athlete to undergo random drug testing as a condition of participating in sports, even if the student refuses to sign an authorization form. The scenario involves a star basketball player who did not sign the required authorization for random drug testing, but the coach requested a urine sample after a game. The student refused, citing concerns about a potential positive test result affecting his scholarship prospects. The coach admitted there was no individualized suspicion of drug use, and the student was subsequently suspended. The court must decide whether the suspension is lawful.

Key legal precedents, such as *Vernonia School District v. Acton (1995)*, establish that random drug testing of student athletes is constitutional under the Fourth Amendment. The Supreme Court in *Vernonia* held that student athletes have a reduced expectation of privacy and that random drug testing serves a legitimate purpose in maintaining safety and preventing drug use in sports. However, the question here also raises the issue of consent, as the student did not sign the authorization form required by the school's policy.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. Drug testing is considered a search under the Fourth Amendment, but it can be lawful under certain conditions, such as those outlined in *Vernonia*. The claim that it is "not an intrusion on his Fourth Amendment right of privacy" is inaccurate because drug testing does intrude on privacy, though it may be justified.

- **Option C**: Incorrect. While the coach admitted there was no individualized suspicion, *Vernonia* allows random drug testing of student athletes without such suspicion, as long as the testing is part of a broader policy aimed at preventing drug use.

- **Option I**: Correct. The student did not sign the authorization form, which is explicitly required by the school's policy. Without his consent, the school cannot compel him to undergo drug testing, even if he is a student athlete. While *Vernonia* allows random drug testing as a condition of participation in sports, the policy in this case requires signing the authorization form, and the student's refusal to comply with the test was justified by his lack of consent.

- Other options (B, D, E, F, G, H) are either factually incorrect or do not address the central issue of consent.

The court is most likely to rule in favor of the student because he did not consent to the drug test by signing the required authorization form, making the suspension improper.

**Answer: I**
