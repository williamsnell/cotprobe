Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this law question. Let me read it carefully. The situation is that a man and a 14-year-old girl were smoking marijuana together. The man was charged with two offenses: possession and contributing to the delinquency of a minor. The girl was charged with being an accomplice to the latter crime.

The question is about the girl's best defense at trial. The options are from A to J. Hmm, I need to think about the legal principles here.

First, contributing to the delinquency of a minor is a crime where an adult helps a minor engage in delinquent behavior. But here, the girl is being charged as an accomplice to this crime. Wait, can a minor be an accomplice to a crime that's about contributing to delinquency? That seems a bit circular.

I remember that in criminal law, an accomplice is someone who assists the principal in committing the crime. But in this case, the principal is the man, and the girl is the minor involved. So is she considered an accomplice?

I think about the policy behind the law. The purpose of the statute for contributing to the delinquency is to protect minors from harm. So if the girl is the minor being protected, can she be held responsible as an accomplice? It might be against the legislative intent to prosecute the minor she's supposed to be protected.

Looking at the options, option E says since the statute was designed to protect minors, the girl can't be prosecuted as an accomplice. That makes sense because prosecuting her would go against the protective purpose of the law. 

Other options: Option A says the man must be convicted first. I don't think that's necessarily a requirement. The prosecution can proceed against the girl regardless of the man's conviction. Option B is about duress, but the question doesn't say she was forced, so that's not the best defense. Option C talks about unawareness due to age, but she's 14, which might be old enough to know. Option D is about not knowing it was marijuana, but she was smoking it, so she probably knew. Option F is about being under the influence, but that's not a solid defense in this context.

Option G says smoking doesn't make her an accomplice. Well, if she actively participated, maybe she is. But the better defense is the policy reason in E. Option H says a minor can't be prosecuted for an adult crime, but she's being charged as an accomplice, not necessarily tried as an adult. Option I says she can't be prosecuted because she's a victim. That's an interesting point, but I think the better argument is E, the purpose of the statute.

Option J is about not supplying, but she was smoking, so she's participating. So the best defense is E.

The girl's best defense is that the statute was designed to protect minors, and prosecuting her as an accomplice would contradict this protective purpose. 

E
