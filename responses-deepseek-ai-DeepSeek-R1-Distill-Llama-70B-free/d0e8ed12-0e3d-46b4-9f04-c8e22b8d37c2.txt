Okay, so I've got this problem about finding the right inductance to resonate at a certain frequency with a given capacitance. Hmm, I remember from my physics class that resonance in circuits involves inductors and capacitors. Oh right, it's an LC circuit. 

Wait, the formula for resonance frequency is something like f equals 1 over the square root of (L times C). Right, the formula is f = 1/(2π√(LC)). Oh wait, yeah, so that's the resonance frequency for the LC circuit.

The question says the frequency is 10 MHz. Oh wait, MHz is megahertz, so that's 10^7 Hz. And the capacitance is 100 pF, which is 100e-12 farads. I need to find the inductance L.

So I should rearrange the formula to solve for L. Let me see. Starting from f = 1/(2π√(LC)), I can square both sides to get rid of the square root. So f squared equals 1 over (4π² L C). Then, taking reciprocals, 1/f² equals 4π² L C. So solving for L, I get L = 1/(4π² C f²).

Wait, let me double-check that. Let me write it out step by step.

Given:
f = 10 MHz = 10^7 Hz
C = 100 pF = 100e-12 F

We have f = 1/(2π√(LC)) → rearranged, L = 1/(4π² f² C)

Yes, that's right. So plugging in the numbers:

L = 1/(4 * π² * (10^7)^2 * 100e-12 )

Let me compute each part step by step. 

First, 10^7 squared is (10^7)^2 = 10^14.

So denominator starts as 4 * π² * 10^14 * 100e-12.

Hmm, 100e-12 is 1e-10. So 4 * π² * 10^14 * 1e-10.

Wait, 1e-10 * 1e14 is 1e4, which is 10,000. So denominator becomes 4 * π² * 10,000.

So denominator is 4 * π² * 1e4.

Wait, let me compute this more carefully.

4 * π² is approximately 4*(9.8696) ≈ 39.4784.

So 39.4784 * 1e4 = 394784.

So L = 1 / (394784) → let me calculate that.

1 / 394784 ≈ 0.000002534 → that's 2.534e-6 H, which is 2.534 microhenrys.

Wait, looking at the options, let me see: option J is 2.53 μH, which is very close. But wait, did I compute that correctly?

Wait, maybe I should compute it more accurately. Let me do the exact calculation without approximating pi.

Pi is about 3.14159265, so pi squared is approximately 9.8696044.

So 4 * pi squared is 4 * 9.8696044 ≈ 39.4784176.

Now, 10^7 is 10,000,000, so squared is 1e14, correct.

So 39.4784176 * 1e14 * 100e-12 → wait, wait, 100e-12 is 1e-10 as before.

So 1e14 * 1e-10 = 1e4 = 10,000.

So 39.4784176 * 10,000 = 394,784.176.

So L = 1 / 394784.176 ≈ 2.533e-6 H, which is 2.533 μH.

Looking at the options, option J is 2.53 μH. That's the closest. So the answer should be J.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me recalculate because sometimes these problems have exact values. Let me compute this with more precise steps.

Alternatively, let me represent it using exact terms.

L = 1/(4π² * (10^7)^2 * 100e-12 )

So 10^7 squared is 1e14, and the 100e-12 is 1e-10.

So 1e14 * 1e-10 is 1e4. So 4π² * 1e4 is 4e4 * π².

So L = 1/(4e4 * π²) → 1/(4e4 * 9.8696) → 1/( (4 * 9.8696) * 1e4 ) → 1/(39.4784 * 1e4) → 1/394784 → same as before, 2.533e-6 H.

So yeah, 2.53 μH, which matches option J.

To determine the required inductance \( L \) for resonance at \( f = 10 \, \text{MHz} \) with a capacitance \( C = 100 \, \text{pF} \), we use the resonance condition for an \( LC \) circuit:

\[
f = \frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{LC}}
\]

Rearranging for \( L \), we get:

\[
L = \frac{1}{4\pi^2 f^2 C}
\]

### Given:
- \( f = 10 \, \text{MHz} = 10^7 \, \text{Hz} \)
- \( C = 100 \, \text{pF} = 100 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{F} = 10^{-10} \, \text{F} \)

### Substitution:
\[
L = \frac{1}{4\pi^2 (10^7)^2 (10^{-10})}
\]

1. Compute \( (10^7)^2 = 10^{14} \).
2. Multiply \( 10^{14} \times 10^{-10} = 10^4 \).
3. Compute \( 4\pi^2 \), where \( \pi^2 \approx 9.8696 \), so \( 4\pi^2 \approx 39.4784 \).
4. Multiply \( 39.4784 \times 10^4 = 394784 \).

Thus:
\[
L = \frac{1}{394784} \approx 2.533 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{H} = 2.53 \, \mu\text{H}
\]

### Final Answer:
The closest option to \( 2.53 \, \mu\text{H} \) is **J: 2.53 μH**.
