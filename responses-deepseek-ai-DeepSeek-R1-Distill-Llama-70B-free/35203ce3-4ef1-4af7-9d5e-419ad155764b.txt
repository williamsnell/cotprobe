Okay, so I have this question about polynomials and interpolation. Hmm, the question is about the minimal-degree interpolating polynomial for a function f(x) at n+1 distinct real numbers x0 to xn. I need to find the maximum possible degree of p(x) from the given options.

Wait, I remember something about interpolation from my classes. Oh right, I think it's related to the idea that if you have a certain number of points, you can fit a polynomial through them. But what's the minimal degree required?

Oh wait, I think the minimal degree interpolating polynomial is usually of degree at most n, where n is the number of points minus one. Because if you have n+1 points, you can fit a unique polynomial of degree n. So, the minimal degree would be n. But wait, the question is about the maximum possible degree of p(x). Hmm, wait, no, because p(x) is the minimal-degree polynomial, so its degree can't be higher than necessary.

Wait, wait. No, wait again. The minimal-degree interpolating polynomial would have the smallest degree possible that still passes through all the points. But what's the maximum possible degree it could have? Because for some functions, maybe the minimal degree is lower, but the maximum possible would be when the minimal degree is as high as possible.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. If you have n+1 points, the unique interpolating polynomial of minimal degree is degree at most n. So the maximum possible degree is n. So the answer would be n, which is option G.

But wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing things up. Another thought: suppose f(x) is a polynomial of degree m. Then the minimal degree interpolating polynomial would be of degree m, assuming m ≤ n, because if m > n, then you can't represent it exactly with a degree n polynomial, but wait, no, because if f(x) is a polynomial of higher degree, then the interpolating polynomial would still be of degree n, but it would only match at those n+1 points, not everywhere else.

Wait, no, the question is about the minimal-degree interpolating polynomial for f(x) at those points. So if f(x) is a polynomial of degree m, then the interpolating polynomial p(x) would be equal to f(x) only if m ≤ n. Otherwise, p(x) would be a degree n polynomial that agrees with f(x) at those points but differs elsewhere.

So the minimal degree p(x) would have degree at most n. Therefore, the maximum possible degree is n.

So looking back at the options, option G is n, so the answer should be G.

The question asks for the maximum possible degree of the minimal-degree interpolating polynomial \( p(x) \) for a real-valued function \( f(x) \) at \( n+1 \) distinct real numbers \( x_0, \dots, x_n \). 

To determine this, we rely on the fundamental theorem of polynomial interpolation, which states that for \( n+1 \) distinct points, there exists a unique interpolating polynomial of degree at most \( n \). This polynomial passes through all the given points and is the minimal-degree polynomial that satisfies the interpolation condition. 

The key point is that the minimal-degree interpolating polynomial cannot have a degree higher than \( n \), as \( n \) is the maximum degree required to uniquely fit \( n+1 \) points. While \( f(x) \) could theoretically be a polynomial of higher degree, the interpolating polynomial \( p(x) \) would still be constrained to degree \( n \), as it only needs to match \( f(x) \) at the \( n+1 \) specified points.

Thus, the maximum possible degree of \( p(x) \) is \( n \).

The correct answer is:

**G: n**
