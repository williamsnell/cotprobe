Okay, so I've got this math problem here. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question says that a is 7 and b is 13, and we need to find the number of even positive integers less than the product of a and b. The options are given from A to J.

First, I'll calculate the product of a and b. So, a is 7, b is 13. Multiplying them together: 7 * 13. Let's see, 7 times 10 is 70, and 7 times 3 is 21, so 70 +21 is 91. So ab is 91.

Now, the question is about even positive integers less than ab. So, ab is 91. So we're looking for even numbers less than 91.

Wait, wait. Even numbers are numbers divisible by 2. So the sequence would be 2,4,6,... up to the largest even number less than 91.

What's the largest even number less than 91? Well, 91 is odd, so the largest even number below it is 90.

So now, I need to find how many terms are in the sequence from 2 to 90, inclusive, with a common difference of 2.

The formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d. Here, a_1 is 2, d is 2, and a_n is 90.

Plugging in the numbers: 90 = 2 + (n-1)*2.

Subtract 2 from both sides: 88 = (n-1)*2.

Divide both sides by 2: 44 = n-1.

Add 1 to both sides: n =45.

Wait, so that would suggest there are 45 even numbers. But wait, let me double-check because sometimes off-by-one errors happen.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the count of even numbers less than or equal to N is floor(N/2). But wait, in this case, the number should be less than ab, which is 91. So we're looking for even numbers less than 91, which is the same as even numbers up to 90.

So another approach: the number of even numbers less than 91 is the same as (90)/2, which is 45. Yep, that matches the earlier result.

So the answer should be 45, which is option I think. Let me look at the options again.

Options are:
A:181
B:45
C:179
D:91
E:89
F:180
G:47
H:44
I:46
J:90

Wait, no, option B is 45. So the correct answer should be B.

Wait, wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's recount the numbers. Starting from 2 up to 90, step 2.

Number of terms = ((last term - first term) / step) +1.

So (90-2)/2 +1 = (88/2)+1 =44 +1=45. Yep, that's correct.

So I think the right answer is B:45.

To solve the problem, we first calculate the product of \( a \) and \( b \), where \( a = 7 \) and \( b = 13 \). 

\[
ab = 7 \times 13 = 91
\]

Next, we need to determine the number of even positive integers less than \( ab \), which is 91. Even positive integers are numbers divisible by 2, so we are looking for the sequence \( 2, 4, 6, \dots, 90 \). 

The largest even number less than 91 is 90. To find the number of terms in this arithmetic sequence, we use the formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:

\[
a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d
\]

Here, \( a_1 = 2 \), \( d = 2 \), and \( a_n = 90 \). Substituting these values:

\[
90 = 2 + (n-1) \times 2
\]

Simplify:

\[
88 = (n-1) \times 2
\]

\[
44 = n-1
\]

\[
n = 45
\]

Thus, there are 45 even positive integers less than 91. This matches the result obtained using the alternative method of dividing 90 by 2, which also gives 45.

The correct answer is:

**B: 45**
