To solve the problem 365 + 56, I start by adding the units place: 5 + 6 equals 11. I write down 1 and carry over 1 to the tens place. Next, I add the tens place: 6 + 5 equals 11, plus the carried-over 1 makes 12. I write down 2 and carry over 1 to the hundreds place. Finally, I add the hundreds place: 3 + 0 equals 3, plus the carried-over 1 makes 4. Combining these, the total is 421.

Looking at the options provided, the correct answer is option D: 421.
