Question:

A 28-year-old man comes to the office because he would like to quit smoking cigarettes. He says, "I cannot go more than a day without cigarettes because I get so anxious and irritable. I even wake up at night to smoke." The patient began smoking cigarettes at age 12 years; he was smoking two packs of cigarettes daily by age 17 years, and he has not curtailed his use since that time. He does not drink alcoholic beverages or use illicit drugs. Medical history is remarkable for childhood febrile seizures. He takes no medications. Vital signs are normal. The patient is interested in using a nicotine patch and bupropion therapy because he says his friend found the treatments to be helpful. In combining these two therapies, this patient is at greatest risk for which of the following?

Options:

A: Hypertension
B: Heart arrhythmia
C: Increased anxiety
D: Polyuria
E: Renal insufficiency
F: Liver toxicity
G: Hypoglycemia
H: The patient is at no increased risk
I: Seizures
J: Respiratory distress

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this medical question about a patient wanting to quit smoking. Let me break it down step by step.

The patient is a 28-year-old man who's been smoking since he was 12. He's up to two packs a day now. He's tried to quit but can't go more than a day without cigarettes because he gets anxious and irritable, even waking up at night to smoke. So he's clearly nicotine-dependent, probably pretty heavily.

He doesn't drink or use other drugs, which is good because that might complicate things. His medical history includes childhood febrile seizures. No current medications, and his vitals are normal.

He wants to use a nicotine patch and bupropion. His friend found them helpful, so he's interested in combining them. The question is about the greatest risk when these two therapies are combined.

I remember that bupropion is an antidepressant, specifically a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor. It's also known to help with smoking cessation. But wait, what are the side effects or risks of bupropion?

One major thing that comes to mind is that bupropion can lower the seizure threshold. So, people with a history of seizures shouldn't take it. The patient here had febrile seizures as a child. Febrile seizures are typically benign and not associated with an increased risk of future seizures unless there are other factors. But I'm not sure if a history of any seizures, even febrile, is a contraindication.

Wait, let me think. I think the contraindication for bupropion includes a history of seizures, especially unprovoked ones. Febrile seizures are provoked by fever, usually in childhood. So maybe the risk is lower, but the question is, does combining it with a nicotine patch increase the risk further?

Wait, no, the question is about the combination of the two therapies. So the main issue is whether bupropion alone is risky, but since the patient is also using a nicotine patch, any interaction?

Alternatively, I'm trying to recall if there's a specific side effect when combining these two. I know that both can affect the central nervous system. Nicotine itself can cause some anxiety and irritability, but in this case, the patient is using the patch to manage withdrawal symptoms.

Wait, but bupropion's main side effect is the risk of seizures. The patient had febrile seizures as a child. I think that febrile seizures, especially when they're not recurrent and happened in childhood, might not be a strict contraindication, but the doctor should be cautious.

So the question asks, when combining the two, what's the greatest risk. So the options are A to J. Let's go through them.

Option A: Hypertension. Both nicotine and bupropion can potentially affect blood pressure. Nicotine can increase heart rate and blood pressure. But I don't think it's the most significant risk here.

Option B: Heart arrhythmia. Nicotine can increase heart rate, and maybe arrhythmias, but again, not the biggest risk.

Option C: Increased anxiety. Both might cause some anxiety, but that's more of a symptom of withdrawal, perhaps, not a major risk.

Option D: Polyuria. Not sure about that. Maybe related to the patch? I don't recall.

Option E: Renal insufficiency. I don't see how the combination would affect kidneys much.

Option F: Liver toxicity. Bupropion can be hepatotoxic, but it's rare. The patch delivers nicotine, which is metabolized in the liver, but again, not the main issue here.

Option G: Hypoglycemia. Doesn't seem related.

Option H: No increased risk. Unlikely because combining two medications usually has some risks.

Option I: Seizures. This seems to be the key point. Bupropion can lower the seizure threshold, and if the patient has any history of seizures, even febrile, there's a potential increased risk. So combining it with a nicotine patchâ€”maybe the patch doesn't contribute, but the bupropion is the main culprit here.

Option J: Respiratory distress. I don't think so. Unless the patient has asthma or COPD, but there's no mention.

So putting it together: the patient is on bupropion, which has a risk of seizures. His history of febrile seizures might make this risk higher than usual. So the greatest risk is seizures, which is option I.
</think>

The patient is a 28-year-old man with a history of heavy smoking since age 12 and significant nicotine dependence. He is seeking to quit smoking using a combination of a nicotine patch and bupropion. Bupropion, an antidepressant and smoking cessation aid, is known to lower the seizure threshold, which could be problematic given the patient's history of childhood febrile seizures. While febrile seizures are typically benign and not associated with a significantly increased risk of future seizures, the use of bupropion in this context warrants caution. The nicotine patch itself does not directly increase the risk of seizures, but the combination of bupropion with the patient's medical history raises the concern. Among the options provided, the greatest risk is seizures.

Answer: I
