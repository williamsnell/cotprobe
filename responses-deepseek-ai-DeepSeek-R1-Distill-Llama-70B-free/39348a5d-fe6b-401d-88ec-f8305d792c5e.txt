Okay, so I've got this question here about a sedan flipping over when it slides sideways into a curb. Hmm, I'm not super familiar with all the physics involved, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question is asking at what speed the sedan will flip. The options are from 10 mph up to 100 mph, and there's an option with mpg, which I think might be a typo because mpg is miles per gallon, not speed. So I can probably ignore option D.

I remember that when a car slides sideways into a curb, it's about the forces acting on the vehicle. The curb would apply a force that could cause the car to tip over. I think this has to do with the center of gravity and the point where the force is applied. If the force is applied outside the car's center of gravity, it creates a torque that can cause it to flip.

But wait, how does speed factor into this? Speed would relate to the momentum of the car, right? Momentum is mass times velocity. So a higher speed means more momentum, which might make it harder to flip because the car has more inertia. Or does it make it easier because the force from the curb is applied more suddenly?

I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. When a car is moving and hits a curb sideways, the curb provides a stopping force. The faster the car is moving, the more kinetic energy it has, so the impact might be more severe. But I'm not sure if that directly translates to flipping. Maybe it's more about the angle of impact and the height of the center of gravity relative to the width of the vehicle.

I remember something about rollover accidents depending on the vehicle's stability. Taller vehicles, like SUVs, are more prone to rolling over because their center of gravity is higher. Sedans are lower, so they might be less likely to flip, but if they hit something that applies a force at a certain point, it could still happen.

So, what's a typical speed where a sedan might flip when sliding into a curb? I'm trying to recall any real-life examples or studies. I think that even at lower speeds, if the impact is direct and forceful enough, it could cause a flip. But higher speeds probably increase the likelihood.

Wait, but the question is asking at what speed it will flip. So maybe it's a specific threshold. I'm not sure if there's a standard speed for this. I think it's more about the force and the vehicle's design than a specific speed. But the question is multiple-choice, so I have to pick from the options given.

Looking at the options, they range from 10 mph to 100 mph. I'm leaning towards a lower speed because higher speeds would likely cause more severe damage, but maybe the flip threshold is lower. Alternatively, maybe the force from the curb at higher speeds is enough to cause the flip regardless.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about similar scenarios. For example, when a car hydroplanes or skids, the speed determines how much distance it covers before stopping. But flipping is more about the torque applied during the collision.

I think the critical factor is the point of impact relative to the center of gravity. If the curb hits the car's side at a point far enough from the center of gravity, it can cause a rollover. The speed might influence how much force is applied during the collision. So higher speed could mean a more forceful impact, increasing the chance of flipping.

Wait, but sometimes even at lower speeds, if the angle is just right, a car can tip. So maybe the speed isn't the only factor. But since the question is specifically about the speed, perhaps it's expecting a general answer based on typical scenarios.

I'm going to take a guess here. I think that a sedan might flip over at around 30-40 mph if it slides sideways into a curb. So looking at the options, C is 30 mph, J is 40 mph. I'm not sure which one is more accurate. Another thought: police chase videos sometimes show cars flipping at higher speeds when they hit curbs or other obstacles.

Wait, maybe the speed isn't as high as 60 or 70. Lower speeds might be sufficient if the impact is direct. So perhaps 30 mph is the answer. Or maybe it's even lower, like 20 mph. But I think 30 feels more reasonable for a sedan.

Alternatively, considering that higher speeds would cause more energy upon impact, but the force required to flip depends on the vehicle's mass and center of gravity. Maybe 30 mph is the point where the force from the curb overcomes the car's stability.

I think I'll go with option C: 30 mph.

The question asks at what speed a sedan will flip over when it slides sideways into a curb. To determine this, several factors must be considered, including the forces involved, the vehicle's center of gravity, and the point of impact. The speed influences the momentum and kinetic energy, which affect the severity of the impact. However, flipping also depends on the torque generated by the force applied relative to the vehicle's center of gravity.

The options provided range from 10 mph to 100 mph, with one option (D: 80 mpg) likely being a typo and irrelevant. After considering the physics of the situation and typical scenarios, it is reasoned that a sedan might flip at a moderate speed, such as 30 mph, where the force from the curb could overcome the vehicle's stability. While higher speeds increase the force of impact, lower speeds can still cause a flip if the conditions are right.

Based on this reasoning, the most plausible answer is:

C: 30 mph
