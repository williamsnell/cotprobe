Okay, so I've got this question about why the elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen are so important in living matter. Hmm, I remember from my biology class that these elements are the main components of biomolecules. Let me think about each option to see which one makes the most sense.

The question gives options A through J. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A says these elements are the only ones that form gases at room temperature. Wait, I know that oxygen and nitrogen are gases at room temp, but carbon isn't. Carbon is a solid. Hydrogen is a gas, but I'm not sure if they're the only elements to form gases. Maybe there are others, so this might not be the right reason.

Option B states these elements are abundant in living organisms, can readily form covalent bonds, and are the lightest to do so. That rings a bell. I remember that carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen form the basis of organic molecules like proteins, fats, carbohydrates, etc. They form a lot of covalent bonds because of their valency. Plus, being light might help in forming stable molecules, so this seems plausible.

Option C suggests they're the primary energy sources. I know that's not right because the primary energy source is the sun, and in terms of elements, carbon is part of glucose which is an energy source. But oxygen and nitrogen are more about structure and other functions. So C might not be correct.

Option D says they're radioactive, which isn't true. Radioactive elements are heavier, like uranium. So D is wrong.

Option E talks about sublimation. I don't recall sublimation being a key process in living organisms. Sublimation is when a substance goes from solid to gas without melting. Not a big factor in biochemistry, I think.

Option F claims they're rare and thus valuable. But in reality, these elements are pretty abundant. For example, oxygen is a major component of the atmosphere and water. So F doesn't make sense.

Option G says they give color to organisms. That's not the main reason. While some biomolecules have color (like chlorophyll or hemoglobin), color isn't the primary reason these elements are important.

Option H says they're only found in DNA and proteins. No, that's not true. They're found in many other biomolecules too, like lipids, though in smaller amounts. So H is incorrect.

Option I says they're the heaviest elements in living organisms. No, heavier elements like iron, zinc, etc., are present, though in smaller quantities. So I is wrong.

Option J mentions magnetic properties. I don't think these elements have magnetic properties that are essential for life. So J is out.

So the correct answer seems to be option B. These elements are abundant, can form covalent bonds easily, and are the lightest to do so, which makes them perfect for forming the complex molecules needed for life.

The elements carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen are crucial in living matter because they are abundant in living organisms and can readily form covalent bonds. These bonds are essential for constructing the complex molecules, such as proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and nucleic acids, that are fundamental to life. Additionally, these elements are among the lightest that can form such bonds, which makes them ideal for creating stable and versatile biomolecules. 

The other options are incorrect because they either describe properties unrelated to the importance of these elements (e.g., being radioactive or magnetic) or misrepresent their roles (e.g., being the only elements that form gases or being rare). Therefore, the correct answer is:

B

Answer: B
