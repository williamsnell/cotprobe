Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the sum of determinants of two matrices, A and B. Let's see what I remember about determinants. 

Matrix A is a 2x2 matrix where each entry (i,j) is equal to i + j. Hmm, wait, I'm a bit confused. Are the rows and columns 1-indexed or 0-indexed? Oh right, in matrix definitions like this, i and j usually start at 1. So for a 2x2 matrix, the indices i and j go from 1 to 2.

Let me write down matrix A. The (1,1) entry is 1+1=2, (1,2) is 1+2=3, (2,1) is 2+1=3, and (2,2) is 2+2=4. So matrix A looks like:

[2 3]
[3 4]

Now, the determinant of a 2x2 matrix [a b; c d] is ad - bc. So for A, it's (2*4) - (3*3) = 8 -9 = -1. So detA is -1.

Wait, no, wait, 2*4 is 8, 3*3 is 9, so 8-9=-1. Yeah, that's right.

Now onto matrix B. It's a 3x3 matrix where each (i,j) is i + j. So i and j run from 1 to 3. Let me construct each row.

First row (i=1): when j=1, 1+1=2; j=2, 1+2=3; j=3, 1+3=4. So first row is [2,3,4].

Second row (i=2): j=1→3, j=2→4, j=3→5. So [3,4,5].

Third row (i=3): j=1→4, j=2→5, j=3→6. So [4,5,6].

So matrix B is:

[2 3 4]
[3 4 5]
[4 5 6]

I need to find the determinant of this 3x3 matrix. Oh, right, calculating determinants for 3x3 can be done by expansion. Let me recall the formula. The determinant is a(ei − fh) − b(di − fg) + c(dh − eg), where the matrix is:

[a b c]
[d e f]
[g h i]

So applying that to our B matrix:

a=2, b=3, c=4
d=3, e=4, f=5
g=4, h=5, i=6

So determinant is 2*(4*6 -5*5) -3*(3*6 -5*4) +4*(3*5 -4*4).

Let me compute each part step by step.

First term: 2*(24 -25) = 2*(-1) = -2.

Second term: -3*(18 -20) → -3*(-2) = 6.

Third term: 4*(15 -16) =4*(-1)= -4.

Now add them all together: -2 +6 -4 = 0.

Wait, that can't be right. Did I do the calculations correctly?

Wait, let me check each calculation again.

First term: (4*6)=24, (5*5)=25. 24-25=-1. Multiply by 2: -2. Correct.

Second term: (3*6)=18, (5*4)=20. 18-20=-2. Multiply by -3: (-3)*(-2)=6. Correct.

Third term: (3*5)=15, (4*4)=16. 15-16=-1. Multiply by 4: -4. Correct.

So adding: -2 +6 is 4, 4-4=0. So detB is 0.

Wait, that's interesting. So detA is -1, detB is 0. The sum is -1 +0 = -1. But looking at the options, option C is -1. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating B's determinant. Maybe I should try another method, like row operations, to see if I get the same result.

Alternatively, I can observe that in matrix B, each row is a linear sequence. Let me see:

Row 1: 2,3,4 → difference of 1 between elements.

Row 2:3,4,5 → same.

Row3:4,5,6 → same.

So each row is in an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 1. Also, each row is the previous row plus 1. Oh wait, because row 2 is row1 plus 1: 2+1=3, 3+1=4, etc. Similarly, row3 is row2 plus 1.

Wait, that means that the rows are linearly dependent. Because row2 = row1 +1, row3= row2 +1 = row1 +2. So row3 - row2 = row2 - row1 → which implies that the rows are linearly dependent. Therefore, the determinant must be zero. That makes sense. So detB is indeed zero.

So the sum detA + detB is (-1) +0 = -1. So the answer is option C.

To solve the problem, we need to compute the determinants of two matrices, \( A \) and \( B \), and then find their sum.

### Matrix \( A \) (2x2)
The matrix \( A \) is defined such that the entry in the \( i \)-th row and \( j \)-th column is \( i + j \). Since \( i \) and \( j \) are 1-indexed, the matrix is:

\[
A = \begin{bmatrix}
2 & 3 \\
3 & 4
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The determinant of a 2x2 matrix \( \begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{bmatrix} \) is given by \( ad - bc \). Applying this formula:

\[
\det(A) = (2 \cdot 4) - (3 \cdot 3) = 8 - 9 = -1
\]

Thus, \( \det(A) = -1 \).

---

### Matrix \( B \) (3x3)
The matrix \( B \) is defined such that the entry in the \( i \)-th row and \( j \)-th column is \( i + j \). The matrix is:

\[
B = \begin{bmatrix}
2 & 3 & 4 \\
3 & 4 & 5 \\
4 & 5 & 6
\end{bmatrix}
\]

The determinant of a 3x3 matrix can be computed using the rule of Sarrus or cofactor expansion. Applying the cofactor expansion:

\[
\det(B) = 2 \cdot (4 \cdot 6 - 5 \cdot 5) - 3 \cdot (3 \cdot 6 - 5 \cdot 4) + 4 \cdot (3 \cdot 5 - 4 \cdot 4)
\]

Breaking it down:

1. First term: \( 2 \cdot (24 - 25) = 2 \cdot (-1) = -2 \)
2. Second term: \( -3 \cdot (18 - 20) = -3 \cdot (-2) = 6 \)
3. Third term: \( 4 \cdot (15 - 16) = 4 \cdot (-1) = -4 \)

Adding these terms together:

\[
\det(B) = -2 + 6 - 4 = 0
\]

Thus, \( \det(B) = 0 \).

---

### Sum of Determinants
The sum of the determinants is:

\[
\det(A) + \det(B) = -1 + 0 = -1
\]

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**C: -1**
