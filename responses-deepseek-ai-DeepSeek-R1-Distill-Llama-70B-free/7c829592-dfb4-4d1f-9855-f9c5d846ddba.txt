Okay, so I have this problem about condensation polymerization of a hydroxyacid. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question says that 99% of the acid groups are used up. I need to calculate the number average molecular weight (Mn) and the weight average molecular weight (Mw). The options are from A to J, so I have to pick the correct pair.

Hmm, condensation polymerization. I remember that in these reactions, like for polyesters or polyamides, each step involves the loss of a small molecule, usually water. The degree of polymerization (Xn) depends on the extent of conversion. I think Flory's equations might come into play here.

Wait, the formula for Mn and Mw in such cases. For a condensation polymer formed from a diacid and a diol, but here it's a hydroxyacid, which means it's a monomer with both a hydroxyl and an acid group. So it can undergo self-condensation.

In such a case, each monomer unit has two functional groups. So when they react, they lose water, and the number of molecules decreases as the reaction proceeds.

I recall that for a polymerization where p is the conversion (fraction of functional groups that have reacted), the number average degree of polymerization Xn is given by Xn = 1/(1 - p), but wait, no, that's for a step-growth polymerization where the reaction is between two different functional groups, like a diacid and a diol. But in this case, since it's a hydroxyacid, the monomer has two functional groups (OH and COOH) reacting with each other. So the formula might be a bit different.

Wait, no, wait. For a hydroxyacid, each molecule has both groups, so the reaction is between the acid group of one molecule and the hydroxyl group of another. So the stoichiometry is balanced; each reaction step consumes one acid and one hydroxyl group.

So in that case, maybe the same formulas apply. So p is the extent of reaction, which is 0.99 here (99% conversion). So the number average degree of polymerization Xn is 1/(1-p) = 1/(1-0.99) = 1/0.01 = 100.

Wait, but wait another thing. For a hydroxyacid, each monomer forms a dimer, then the dimer can react further. So the average degree of polymerization would be Xn = 1/(1 - p), which at p=1 would be infinite, which makes sense for a fully converted polymer.

So Xn is 100 in this case. Now, the number average molecular weight Mn is Xn multiplied by the molar mass of the repeating unit.

Wait, what's the molar mass of the monomer? The problem states the residue weight is 200 g/mol. So each monomer contributes 200 g/mol as the repeating unit. So Mn = Xn * 200 = 100 * 200 = 20,000 g/mol. So 2.0e4.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. The residue weight is the molecular weight of the monomer without considering the condensation. So each polymerization step loses a small molecule, like water. So the formula for the polymer would be (monomer)_(n) - (water)_(n-1), but the molar mass of the polymer is n*(M) - (n-1)(18 g/mol), where M is the monomer's molar mass.

Wait, but for number average and weight average, when the degree of polymerization is high, the loss of water becomes negligible compared to the total. So perhaps for Mn, it's approximately Xn multiplied by the molar mass of the monomer.

Wait, but wait another approach. The molecular weight of the monomer (hydroxyacid) is, let's say, M_m, which includes both the acid and the hydroxyl. When it polymerizes, each condensation step releases H2O (18 g/mol). So each time two monomers combine, the total molar mass is 2*M_m - 18. So the molar mass of the polymer is n*M_m - (n-1)*18. But for a large n, this is approximately n*(M_m - 0) since (n-1)*18 is much smaller. But I'm not sure if I should include that small correction.

Wait, but looking at the answer options, they have Mn and Mw in the range of 1e4 to 5e4. Let's think: the residue weight is 200 g/mol. So each monomer contributes 200, but when it forms a polymer, each linkage removes 18 g/mol (water). So for a degree of polymerization Xn, the molecular weight would be Xn * 200 - (Xn -1)*18.

But when Xn is 100, that would be 100*200 = 20,000, minus 99*18 = 1782, giving 20,000 - 1,782 = 18,218 g/mol. But wait, that’s a small adjustment. So the Mn would be 18,218, but none of the options have that. So perhaps the problem assumes that the loss of water is negligible, so Mn is approximately Xn * 200.

Wait, but the problem says it's a condensation polymerization, so the correct approach is to account for the loss of water. Hmm. Let me think again.

Wait, let's think about the formula. The number average molecular weight Mn is calculated as the total mass divided by the number of moles. Let me model this. Suppose we have N0 moles of the monomer. Each has a molar mass of M0.

But during condensation, each time two monomers react, they form a dimer and release water. So for each reaction, the number of molecules decreases by 1, and the mass decreases by 18 g/mol.

Wait, but in the case of a hydroxyacid, each molecule has both a -COOH and a -OH group. So the reaction is between these two. Each reaction consumes one -COOH and one -OH from two different molecules.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should look up the formula. Oh wait, I can't do that. So I'll proceed logically.

In a step-growth polymerization where each monomer has two functional groups (like a diol and diacid), the degree of polymerization is given by Xn = 1/(1-p), where p is the fraction of functional groups that have reacted. So in this case, since it's a hydroxyacid, each molecule has two functional groups (OH and COOH), but each reaction consumes one of each, so maybe the same formula applies.

Wait, in this problem, the acid groups are 99% used up. So p_acid = 0.99. But since each reaction consumes one acid and one hydroxyl group, the extent of reaction for the hydroxyl groups should also be 0.99, assuming stoichiometric equivalence, which I think they are because it's the same molecule.

So p = 0.99, and Xn = 1/(1 - p) = 100. So that part is correct.

Now, the molar mass of the polymer. Each monomer contributes (M_m - H2O loss per polymerization step). Wait, wait, no. Each polymerization step (each condensation) adds one monomer unit and loses one water.

Wait, the monomer has a molecular weight of 200 g/mol. When two monomers react, they form a dimer with molecular weight 200*2 - 18 = 382 g/mol. So each time a monomer is added via condensation, the molecular weight increases by (200 - 18) = 182 g/mol.

Wait, but that might not be the right approach. Let me think differently.

The number average molecular weight Mn is given by (average degree of polymerization) * (molar mass of the repeating unit).

What's the repeating unit's molar mass?

For a hydroxyacid, the monomer is something like HOOC-R-COOH? Wait, no, wait. A hydroxyacid has both a hydroxyl and a carboxylic acid group. So perhaps it's like HO-R-COOH. So when it polymerizes, each unit connects via an ester linkage or something similar, losing water.

Wait, the structure might be like HOOC-R-OH, but I'm not entirely sure. Anyway, when it polymerizes, each linkage forms by losing H2O.

So the repeating unit in the polymer would have a molar mass of (M_monomer - H2O). Because each monomer contributes M_monomer, but each condensation step removes 18 g/mol.

So if the monomer's molecular weight is 200 g/mol, each repeating unit in the polymer would be 200 - 18 = 182 g/mol.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right because each condensation step removes 18 g/mol per linkage. So for a polymer of degree Xn, the molar mass would be Xn*M_monomer - (Xn - 1)*18.

Which can be written as Xn*(M_monomer) - 18*(Xn -1).

So for Xn=100, that's 100*200 - 99*18 = 20,000 - 1,782 = 18,218 g/mol.

But looking at the options, the Mn values are in multiples of 1e4, 2e4, etc. So 18,218 is approximately 1.8e4, but I don't see an option with exactly that. Wait, option E has Mn 1.8e4, but let's check.

Wait, but wait another thing. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Because when you form a polymer, each linkage removes one H2O, so for a degree of Xn, the number of linkages is Xn -1. So the molar mass should be:

Mn = Xn * M_monomer - (Xn -1)*18.

So in this case, with Xn=100 and M_monomer=200,

Mn = 100*200 - 99*18 = 20,000 - 1,782 = 18,218 g/mol ≈ 1.82e4.

Looking at the options:

Option E: Mn=1.8e4, Mw=2.8e4.

Option J: Mn=2.0e4, Mw=3.98e4.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I'm making this too complicated. Maybe the question is approximating that the loss of H2O is negligible, so Mn is approximately Xn * M_monomer.

In that case, Mn = 100 * 200 = 20,000 g/mol, which is 2.0e4. Looking at the options, J has Mn=2.0e4.

But wait, then the Mw would be higher. Oh, right, the weight average is always higher than the number average.

So for part a) Mn is 2.0e4, and part b) Mw is higher.

Now, how to calculate Mw. I think for a linear polymer with a given conversion, the ratio of Mw to Mn is approximately (1 + p)/(1 - p). Wait, no, I think Mw is (1 + p)/(1 - p) times Mn, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach. For a step-growth polymerization, the Mw is given by Mw = Mn * (1 + p)/(1 - p).

Wait, let me think. The polydispersity index (PDI) is Mw/Mn. For a linear step-growth polymer, PDI is (1 + p)/(1 - p).

So if Mn is 2.0e4, then Mw would be 2.0e4 * (1 + 0.99)/(1 - 0.99) = 2.0e4 * (1.99)/(0.01) = 2.0e4 * 199.

Wait, that can't be right because 199 * 2e4 is 3.98e6, which is way too high. So I must have messed up the formula.

Wait, no, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let me think again. I think the correct approach is that for a step-growth polymerization, the PDI (Mw/Mn) is (2 + p)/(1 + p). Or maybe another expression.

Wait, another formula: For a step-growth polymerization, the weight average molecular weight is given by Mw = (2 Mn)/(1 + p). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should recall that for a linear condensation polymerization, the number average Xn is 1/(1-p), and the weight average Xw is (1 + p)/(1 - p).

So then Mn = Xn * (M_monomer - (M_water)/(Xn)).

Wait, perhaps I should just find Xw.

Wait, the weight average degree of polymerization Xw is (1 + p)/(1 - p).

So for p=0.99, Xw = (1.99)/(0.01) = 199.

Then, the weight average molecular weight Mw = Xw * (M_monomer - 18) + something? Wait, no, the same as before, each Xw would imply a certain number of linkages.

Wait, maybe the same approach applies: Mw = Xw * M_monomer - (Xw -1)*18.

So Xw=199, M_monomer=200.

Mw = 199*200 - 198*18.

Calculate that: 199*200=39,800; 198*18=3,564.

So Mw = 39,800 - 3,564 = 36,236 g/mol ≈ 3.6e4.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see that. Let me check.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating again. If the loss of water is considered negligible, then Mw would be Xw * M_monomer.

Xw=199, so Mw=199*200=39,800 ≈ 4.0e4.

But looking at the options, the closest would be option J, which has Mn=2.0e4 and Mw=3.98e4.

Wait, but wait, if Xw is 199, and Mw is 199*200 = 39,800, which is 3.98e4. So option J has Mw=3.98e4. So that would fit.

Wait, but earlier I thought that Mn was 2.0e4, which comes from Xn=100 and M_monomer=200, neglecting the water loss. So in that case, Mn=2e4, Mw=3.98e4.

Looking at the options, option J is Mn=2.0e4 and Mw=3.98e4.

So that would make option J the correct answer.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, if I consider that the M_monomer is 200, but each linkage removes 18, so for Xn=100, the Mn is 100*200 - 99*18 = 20,000 - 1,782 = 18,218, which is about 1.82e4. But none of the options with Mn=1.8e4 have a Mw that's 199*200 - 198*18 = 39,800-3,564=36,236. Which is around 3.6e4, but none of the options match that.

Wait, the options are:

Option E: Mn=1.8e4, Mw=2.8e4.

Option J: Mn=2.0e4, Mw=3.98e4.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to neglect the loss of water. So Mn is 100*200=2e4, and Mw is 199*200=3.98e4.

So option J would be the answer.

But I'm a bit confused because the actual formula for Mn includes the loss of water. But perhaps in this problem, the loss is being neglected for simplicity.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the residue weight is given as the molar mass of the repeating unit, which is 200 g/mol. So each repeating unit is 200, and each polymerization doesn't lose any mass beyond that. So in that case, the formula would be Mn = Xn * 200.

If that's the case, then Mn=100*200=2e4, and Mw= Xw * 200, where Xw=(1+p)/(1-p)=199. So Mw=199*200=39,800=3.98e4.

So that would make option J correct.

To solve the problem, we analyze the condensation polymerization of a hydroxyacid with a residue weight of 200 g/mol, where 99% of the acid groups are used up. The goal is to calculate the number-average molecular weight ($M_n$) and the weight-average molecular weight ($M_w$).

### Key Concepts and Formulas:
1. **Degree of Polymerization ($X_n$):**  
   For a step-growth polymerization, the number-average degree of polymerization is given by:  
   \[
   X_n = \frac{1}{1 - p}
   \]  
   where $p$ is the fraction of functional groups that have reacted. Here, $p = 0.99$, so:  
   \[
   X_n = \frac{1}{1 - 0.99} = 100
   \]

2. **Number-Average Molecular Weight ($M_n$):**  
   The number-average molecular weight is calculated as:  
   \[
   M_n = X_n \cdot M_{\text{monomer}}
   \]  
   where $M_{\text{monomer}}$ is the molar mass of the repeating unit. Since the residue weight is 200 g/mol, we assume this is the molar mass of the repeating unit. Thus:  
   \[
   M_n = 100 \cdot 200 = 20,000 \, \text{g/mol} = 2.0 \times 10^4 \, \text{g/mol}
   \]

3. **Weight-Average Molecular Weight ($M_w$):**  
   For a linear step-growth polymerization, the weight-average degree of polymerization is given by:  
   \[
   X_w = \frac{1 + p}{1 - p}
   \]  
   Substituting $p = 0.99$:  
   \[
   X_w = \frac{1 + 0.99
