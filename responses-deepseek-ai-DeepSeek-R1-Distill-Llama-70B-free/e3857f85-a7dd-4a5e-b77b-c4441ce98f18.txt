Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the highest power of 3 that divides a large number N. N is formed by writing all the two-digit integers from 19 to 92 consecutively. So N starts with 19, then 20, 21, all the way up to 92. My task is to find the maximum k such that 3^k divides N.

Hmm, I remember that a number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. And for higher powers like 9, 27, etc., there are more specific rules. But I'm not exactly sure how to apply this for such a large number.

Wait, but maybe I can think about the sum of the digits of N. Because for divisibility by 3, it's the sum that matters. So if I can find the sum of all the digits in N, then I can determine the highest power of 3 that divides it.

So first, I need to figure out how many numbers there are from 19 to 92 inclusive. Let's see, 92 minus 19 is 73, but since both ends are inclusive, I add 1. So 74 numbers total. Each is a two-digit number, so N has 74 * 2 = 148 digits.

Now I need to calculate the sum of all these 148 digits. Breaking it down, each two-digit number contributes its tens digit and its units digit. So maybe I can compute the sum of all tens digits and the sum of all units digits separately.

Let me start with the tens digits. The numbers start at 19 and go to 92. The tens digits change from 1, then 2, 3, ..., up to 9. Let me list the ranges:

- 19: tens digit is 1
- 20-29: tens digit is 2 for 10 numbers
- 30-39: 3, 10 numbers
- ...
- 90-92: 9, but only 3 numbers (90,91,92)

Wait, let's get the exact count for each tens digit. Starting from 19:

- Tens digit 1: only 19, so 1 number.
- Then tens digits from 2 to 8: each covers 10 numbers (like 20-29 is 10 numbers).
- Tens digit 9: numbers from 90 to 92, which is 3 numbers.

So the counts are:

- 1: 1 number
- 2-8: 7 groups, each with 10 numbers
- 9: 3 numbers.

Wait no, because 19 is the first number. So the tens digits go:

- 1: 19 (only one number)
- 2: 20-29 (10 numbers)
- 3: 30-39 (10)
- 4: 40-49 (10)
- 5:50-59 (10)
- 6:60-69 (10)
- 7:70-79 (10)
- 8:80-89 (10)
- 9:90-91-92 (3 numbers)

So the number of numbers per tens digit is:

- 1: 1
- 2:10
- 3:10
- 4:10
- 5:10
- 6:10
- 7:10
- 8:10
- 9:3

Now, the sum of the tens digits would be:

For each tens digit d, multiply d by the number of times it appears.

So sum_tens = (1 * 1) + (2 *10) + (3 *10) + ... + (8 *10) + (9 *3)

Let me compute this step by step.

1*1 =1.

For d=2 to d=8, each contributes 10*d. So sum from d=2 to d=8 of 10*d:

That's 10*(2 +3+4+5+6+7+8). The sum inside is 2+3=5, +4=9, +5=14, +6=20, +7=27, +8=35. So 35. Multiply by 10: 350.

Then d=9 contributes 9*3=27.

So sum_tens = 1 + 350 +27 = 378.

Now the units digits. Each number contributes its units digit. Let's think about each group.

Starting with 19: units digit is 9.

Then 20-29: units digits 0 through 9, so sum is 0+1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9=45.

Similarly, 30-39: same, sum 45.

Same for 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, 80-89.

But 90-92: units digits 0,1,2. Sum is 0+1+2=3.

So the units digits sum is:

19:9 + sum for each group.

So:

Groups contributing 45 each: 20-29,30-39,...,80-89. That's 7 groups (from 2 to 8 in tens digit, since 20-29 is d=2, and 80-89 is d=8). Wait, 20-29 is one group, 30-39 another, up to 80-89. So how many groups? From 2 to 8 is 7 groups, each contributing 45.

Then 90-92 contributes 3.

So sum_units = 9 + 7*45 +3.

Let me compute 7*45: 7*40=280, 7*5=35 → 315.

So 9 + 315 = 324, plus 3 → 327.

So sum_units = 327.

Wait wait, but 19's units digit is 9, which is correct. The groups from 20-29 to 80-89 are 7 groups, each with sum 45. Then 90-92 adds 0,1,2 → sum 3.

So yes, 9 + 7*45 +3 = 9+315+3=327.

So total digit sum is sum_tens + sum_units = 378 + 327 = 705.

Wait, 378 + 327: 300+300=600, 78+27=105 → 705.

Now, the sum of the digits is 705. Now, to find the highest power of 3 that divides N, I think we can use the rule for 3 and 9.

Because 3^1: a number is divisible by 3 if the digit sum is divisible by 3.

3^2 (9): digit sum divisible by 9.

3^3 (27): sum of digits is divisible by 9, but we also need to look at the sum of the digits of the sum.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the digital root. Alternatively, I can compute the sum of digits, then see how many times 3 divides into it.

So the digit sum is 705. Let's find the sum of its digits: 7 +0 +5 =12. Then sum again:1+2=3.

So 705 → digital root 3, which means 705 is divisible by 3, but not by 9. Wait wait, 705 is 700 +5 → 700/3 is not whole, but 705 divided by 3 is 235, so 3^1 is a factor. But for higher powers, like 9, 27, etc., do they divide 705?

Wait, 705 divided by 3 is 235. 235 divided by 3 is about 78.333, so not an integer. So 705 is divisible by 3 once, but not more. So the sum of digits is 705, which is 3^1 * 235. So the maximum power would be 1? But wait, I thought higher powers have more conditions.

Wait, but wait, maybe I'm getting confused. The rule is that a number is divisible by 3^k if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3^k. But wait, that's not exactly correct. Let me think.

For 3^1: sum of digits divisible by 3 → yes, since 705 is divisible by 3.

For 3^2 (9): sum of digits must be divisible by 9. 705 is 7+0+5=12, 12 is not divisible by 9, so 705 isn't divisible by 9. So our digit sum is not divisible by 9, so N isn't divisible by 9, so the highest power is 3^1, so k=1.

Wait, but wait, I thought the digital root being 3 implies the number is divisible by 3 but not by higher powers.

Wait, but maybe I should compute 705 modulo 9. 705 divided by 9: 9*78=702 → 705-702=3 → remainder 3. So 705 is not divisible by 9. Hence, N is divisible by 3 once, so k=1.

But wait, the options have E as 2, which is higher. So maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the digit sum calculation. Let me double-check.

Sum_tens: 1*1 + (2+3+4+5+6+7+8)*10 +9*3.

Sum inside the () for d=2-8 is 2+3+4+5+6+7+8 = 35. So 35*10=350.

Then add 1 (from d=1) and 9*3=27. 1+350=351, +27=378. That's correct.

Sum_units: 19's units is 9, then 7 groups of 45, and 3 from 90-92.

7*45=315, +9=324, +3=327. Correct.

Total sum: 378 + 327 = 705. Correct.

So 705 is the digit sum. 705 mod 9 is 3, as I calculated. So N is divisible by 3 but not 9. So the highest power is 3^1, so k=1.

Wait, but why do I have an option E as 2? Did I do something wrong? Or maybe I'm supposed to consider something else.

Wait, another thought: perhaps N is a very large number, and maybe the sum of digits isn't sufficient for higher powers. Because for 3^3=27, the digit sum isn't enough. But since the digit sum isn't even divisible by 9, it can't be divisible by 27 or higher. So the highest k is 1.

So the answer should be B:1.

But wait, let me think again. Wait, maybe the sum of the digits of N is 705, which is divisible by 3 but not 9. So the highest power is 3^1, so k=1. So the answer is B.

Wait but looking at the options, option B is 1. So I think that's the correct answer.

To determine the highest power of 3 that divides the large integer \( N \), we start by calculating the sum of its digits. The number \( N \) is formed by concatenating all two-digit integers from 19 to 92. 

### Step 1: Count the numbers and their digits
- The range from 19 to 92 includes \( 92 - 19 + 1 = 74 \) numbers.
- Each number is two digits, so \( N \) has \( 74 \times 2 = 148 \) digits.

### Step 2: Calculate the sum of the tens digits
The tens digits range from 1 to 9, with the following counts:
- Tens digit 1: 1 number (19).
- Tens digits 2 to 8: 10 numbers each.
- Tens digit 9: 3 numbers (90, 91, 92).

The sum of the tens digits is:
\[
\text{Sum}_{\text{tens}} = (1 \times 1) + (2 \times 10) + (3 \times 10) + \dots + (8 \times 10) + (9 \times 3)
\]
Breaking it down:
- \( 1 \times 1 = 1 \)
- \( (2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8) \times 10 = 35 \times 10 = 350 \)
- \( 9 \times 3 = 27 \)

Thus:
\[
\text{Sum}_{\text{tens}} = 1 + 350 + 27 = 378
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the sum of the units digits
The units digits range from 0 to 9, with the following contributions:
- For 19: units digit is 9.
- For 20-29, 30-39, ..., 80-89: each group contributes \( 0 + 1 + 2 + \dots + 9 = 45 \).
- For 90-92: units digits are 0, 1, 2, contributing \( 0 + 1 + 2 = 3 \).

The sum of the units digits is:
\[
\text{Sum}_{\text{units}} = 9 + (7 \times 45) + 3
\]
Breaking it down:
- \( 7 \times 45 = 315 \)
- \( 9 + 315 = 324 \)
- \( 324 + 3 = 327 \)

Thus:
\[
\text{Sum}_{\text{units}} = 327
\]

### Step 4: Total sum of digits
The total sum of the digits of \( N \) is:
\[
\text{Sum}_{\text{total}} = \text{Sum}_{\text{tens}} + \text{Sum}_{\text{units}} = 378 + 327 = 705
\]

### Step 5: Determine the highest power of 3
A number is divisible by \( 3^k \) if the sum of its digits is divisible by \( 3^k \). Here:
- \( 705 \) is divisible by \( 3 \) (since \( 705 \div 3 = 235 \)).
- \( 705 \) is not divisible by \( 9 \) (since \( 705 \div 9 = 78.333 \), which is not an integer).

Thus, the highest power of 3 that divides \( N \) is \( 3^1 \), so \( k = 1 \).
