Okay, so I've got this problem here about covariance matrices and eigenvalues. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me start by understanding what's being asked.

So, the problem says that x and y are 2-dimensional random variables. Each has four data points, I think. For x, the data points are (1,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,4). And for y, they're (3,4), (1,5), (5,3), (3,3). The task is to find the covariance matrix Cov of these variables and then compute the sum of its eigenvalues.

Wait, wait. Wait a second. The covariance matrix for two variables, each with n samples, is a 2x2 matrix, right? Because each variable is a 2D random variable, so each observation is a pair. So for each variable, there are four observations. So the covariance matrix will be 2x2, because each variable has two dimensions, and we're considering the covariance between the first components and the second, etc.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Oh, wait, no, the covariance matrix here is probably the covariance between the two random variables x and y. Or wait, no, maybe each of x and y is a 2D variable, so together they form a 4D dataset, but I think that's not the case here. Let me clarify.

Wait, the problem says that x and y are both 2D random variables. So each x is a vector (x1, x2), and each y is a vector (y1, y2). Wait, no. Wait, no, looking at the data provided for x and y. For x, the data points are (1,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,4). So each x is a 2-dimensional vector, and there are four observations of x. Similarly for y.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps x is a 2D random variable with four samples, each being a pair. So each sample is a 2D vector. So for x, the four samples are (1,2), (2,3), etc. Similarly for y.

So the covariance matrix would be the covariance between the components of x and y. Wait, no, that's not clear. Maybe the problem is considering the covariance matrix of the combined variables, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: the covariance matrix for a set of variables is a matrix where each entry (i,j) is the covariance between variable i and variable j. So if we're considering x and y as two separate 2D variables, each with four observations, then the combined data would be four observations in 4D space (x1, x2, y1, y2). But that would make the covariance matrix 4x4, which seems complicated. But the problem states that the covariance matrix is Cov, which is presumably a 2x2 matrix because the options are numbers that look manageable, not too big. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the covariance matrix is for each variable, but that doesn't make sense because the sum of eigenvalues of each would be their variances summed. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the covariance between the two variables x and y. But each is 2D, so that would be a 2x2 matrix for their covariance. Oh, wait, no. Wait, if x is a 2D random variable and y is another 2D random variable, then the covariance between x and y would be a 2x2 matrix where each entry is the covariance between a component of x and a component of y. So Cov(x1, y1), Cov(x1, y2), Cov(x2, y1), Cov(x2, y2). But the problem states that the covariance matrix is Cov for x and y, so maybe that's what it is.

Wait, but in the question, it says "the covariance matrix of x=..., y=... is Cov". So maybe the data is that for each of the four observations, we have x and y as 2D vectors. So for each observation i, we have x_i = (x1_i, x2_i) and y_i = (y1_i, y2_i). Wait, but that's not how the data is presented. Looking back: x is given as ((1,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,4)), so each x is a 2D point, and y is ((3,4), (1,5), (5,3), (3,3)), same structure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that x and y are each 2D variables, and we're to compute the covariance matrix of their combined data. But that would be a 4x4 matrix, which seems complicated. Alternatively, maybe it's the covariance matrix of each variable, but then each would have a 2x2 matrix. But the question refers to the covariance matrix of x and y as Cov. So perhaps it's the cross-covariance between x and y, which would be a 2x2 matrix.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the covariance matrix is for the combined data set of x and y. But that would treat x and y as separate variables, each 2D, leading to a 4D dataset, and a 4x4 covariance matrix. But the sum of its eigenvalues would be the sum of the variances of all four variables, but that doesn't seem right given the answer options.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to read the question again carefully.

The question says: "Assuming x and y are both 2-d random variable. The covariance matrix of x=..., y=... is Cov. What is summation of the eigenvalue of Cov?"

Wait, maybe the question is that the covariance matrix is that of x and y together, meaning each data point is a 4D vector (x1, x2, y1, y2), but that's a 4x4 matrix. But perhaps the question intended to consider x as a vector and y as another vector, and the covariance is between the components of x and y. So the covariance matrix would be 2x2, where each element is the covariance between x1 and y1, x1 and y2, x2 and y1, x2 and y2. That would make sense, and the sum of eigenvalues would be the trace of the matrix, which is the sum of the diagonal elements.

Wait, no, the trace is the sum of the eigenvalues, yes. So perhaps the problem is to compute the covariance matrix between the components of x and y, sum its eigenvalues, which equals the trace. Alternatively, maybe it's the sum of the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of x and the covariance matrix of y, but that doesn't seem to fit.

Hmm, maybe I should proceed by computing the cross-covariance matrix between x and y, treating x as a 2-dimensional variable and y as another 2-dimensional variable. So for each observation, the x is a 2D vector, and y is a 2D vector. So the cross-covariance matrix would be E[(x - E[x])(y - E[y])^T], which is a 2x2 matrix.

So, to compute this, I'll need to compute the means of x and y, then compute the deviations from the mean, multiply the corresponding components, and average them.

Wait, but for cross-covariance, each element (i,j) is the covariance between x_i and y_j. So, for x1 and y1, x1 and y2, x2 and y1, x2 and y2.

Wait, but in any case, perhaps the process is as follows:

1. Compute the mean of each component of x and y.
2. For each observation, compute the deviations from the mean for x's components and y's components.
3. Multiply the corresponding deviations for each pair (x1, y1), (x1, y2), etc., and average across all observations to get the covariance matrix entries.

Once I have the Cov matrix, I can find its eigenvalues and sum them. Alternatively, the sum of eigenvalues is equal to the trace of the matrix, which is the sum of the diagonal elements.

Wait, no, the trace is the sum of the diagonal elements, and the sum of eigenvalues equals the trace. So perhaps I don't need to compute the eigenvalues explicitly; I can just add the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix.

Wait, but if the covariance matrix is 2x2, then the sum of its eigenvalues would be equal to the trace, which is Cov(x1, x1) + Cov(x2, x2) if it's the covariance matrix of x. But in this case, if it's a cross-covariance matrix between x and y, then the trace would be Cov(x1, y1) + Cov(x2, y2). But I'm not entirely sure if that's correct, because the cross-covariance matrix isn't symmetric, so its eigenvalues aren't necessarily real. Hmm, but maybe in this case, it is symmetric, depending on how it's set up.

Wait, wait, no. The cross-covariance matrix between x and y is generally not symmetric. For example, the (1,2) entry is the covariance between x1 and y2, and the (2,1) entry is the covariance between x2 and y1. These two are not necessarily the same, so the matrix could be asymmetric. Therefore, the eigenvalues could be complex, which complicates things. But that might not be the case here, depending on the data.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the covariance matrix of the combined data, treating x and y as separate variables. So each observation is a 4-dimensional vector (x1, x2, y1, y2), and the covariance matrix would be 4x4. But then the sum of eigenvalues would be the sum of variances of all four variables plus twice the covariances between x1 and x2, x1 and y1, etc. But that would be a 4x4 matrix, and calculating eigenvalues for that manually would be time-consuming, especially without a calculator.

Wait, maybe the problem is simpler. Let me read it again. It says, "the covariance matrix of x=..., y=... is Cov." So perhaps x and y are each 2D, but the covariance matrix is of the entire dataset, meaning each observation is a 2D vector, so the covariance matrix is 2x2. But then, how are x and y being used here?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that x and y are each 1D variables, but that's not what the question says. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try an alternative approach. Maybe the question is asking for the sum of the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the combined data of x and y. So each observation is a 4-dimensional vector (x1, x2, y1, y2). The covariance matrix would be 4x4, and the sum of its eigenvalues would be the sum of the variances of all four variables plus twice the covariances between each pair. But that seems a lot, and the answer options are all single numbers, so perhaps that's not the case.

Wait, maybe the problem is that x and y are each 2D, but the covariance matrix is being taken between their components. So for each observation, x is (x1, x2), y is (y1, y2). So the combined data is four variables: x1, x2, y1, y2. So the covariance matrix would be 4x4. Then, the sum of its eigenvalues would be the trace, which is the sum of the variances of each variable. But again, that seems complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps the covariance matrix is that of the concatenated data, treating x and y as separate variables. So for each observation, you have x as a 2D vector and y as a 2D vector, so the combined vector is (x1, x2, y1, y2). So the covariance matrix would be 4x4, and the sum of eigenvalues would be the sum of the diagonal elements, which are the variances of each component.

But let's proceed step by step.

First, let's compute the mean of each component.

For x:

x has four observations:
(1,2), (2,3), (3,3), (4,4).

So x1 components: 1, 2, 3, 4.

Mean of x1: (1 + 2 + 3 + 4)/4 = 10/4 = 2.5.

x2 components: 2, 3, 3, 4.

Mean of x2: (2 +3 +3 +4)/4 = 12/4 = 3.

For y:

y has four observations:
(3,4), (1,5), (5,3), (3,3).

y1 components: 3,1,5,3.

Mean of y1: (3 +1 +5 +3)/4 = 12/4 = 3.

y2 components: 4,5,3,3.

Mean of y2: (4 +5 +3 +3)/4 = 15/4 = 3.75.

Now, to compute the cross-covariance matrix between x and y. The cross-covariance matrix is 2x2, where each element (i,j) is the covariance between x_i and y_j.

The formula for covariance between two variables a and b is:

Cov(a, b) = (1/(n-1)) * sum_{k=1 to n} (a_k - mean_a)(b_k - mean_b)

Wait, but sometimes it's 1/n and sometimes 1/(n-1). The problem doesn't specify, but in many cases, the sample covariance uses 1/(n-1) to be unbiased. But I'm not entirely sure here. Let me check both possibilities, but perhaps the question expects 1/n.

Wait, the question doesn't specify, so perhaps we should proceed with 1/(n-1) as it's more common for sample covariance. But for the sake of this problem, perhaps it doesn't matter as long as we're consistent.

Wait, let me proceed with 1/(n) for simplicity, unless told otherwise. Or maybe the question expects 1/(n), given that it's a theoretical covariance matrix.

Wait, the question says "covariance matrix", which in probability theory is the expected value, so it's 1/n. But in samples, it's often 1/(n-1). Hmm. But perhaps the problem expects us to use 1/n, as it's the population covariance.

So, for each of the four data points, we'll compute (x1_i - mean_x1)(y1_i - mean_y1), sum them, and divide by n (which is 4) to get Cov(x1, y1).

Similarly for the other entries.

So let's compute each entry of the cross-covariance matrix.

First, compute the deviations for each observation.

For x1 and y1:

Observation 1:
x1 =1, dev_x1 = 1 -2.5 = -1.5
y1=3, dev_y1=3-3=0
product = (-1.5)(0)=0

Observation 2:
x1=2, dev_x1=2-2.5=-0.5
y1=1, dev_y1=1-3=-2
product = (-0.5)(-2) = 1

Observation3:
x1=3, dev_x1=3-2.5=0.5
y1=5, dev_y1=5-3=2
product=0.5*2=1

Observation4:
x1=4, dev_x1=4-2.5=1.5
y1=3, dev_y1=3-3=0
product=1.5*0=0

Sum of products for Cov(x1, y1) = 0 +1 +1 +0=2

Divide by n=4: Cov(x1, y1) = 2/4=0.5

Similarly, compute Cov(x1, y2):

For each observation, compute (x1_i - mean_x1)(y2_i - mean_y2).

Mean_y2 is 3.75.

Observation1:
x1=1, dev_x1=-1.5
y2=4, dev_y2=4-3.75=0.25
product = (-1.5)(0.25) = -0.375

Observation2:
x1=2, dev_x1=-0.5
y2=5, dev_y2=5-3.75=1.25
product = (-0.5)(1.25)=-0.625

Observation3:
x1=3, dev_x1=0.5
y2=3, dev_y2=3-3.75=-0.75
product=0.5*(-0.75)=-0.375

Observation4:
x1=4, dev_x1=1.5
y2=3, dev_y2=3-3.75=-0.75
product=1.5*(-0.75)=-1.125

Sum of products: (-0.375) + (-0.625) + (-0.375) + (-1.125) = Let's compute:

-0.375 -0.625 is -1.0

-1.0 -0.375 is -1.375

-1.375 -1.125 is -2.5

Cov(x1,y2) = (-2.5)/4 = -0.625

Next, Cov(x2, y1):

For each observation, compute (x2_i - mean_x2)(y1_i - mean_y1).

Mean_x2 is 3, mean_y1 is 3.

Observation1:
x2=2, dev_x2=2-3=-1
y1=3, dev_y1=0
product= (-1)(0)=0

Observation2:
x2=3, dev_x2=0
y1=1, dev_y1=-2
product=0*(-2)=0

Observation3:
x2=3, dev_x2=0
y1=5, dev_y1=2
product=0*2=0

Observation4:
x2=4, dev_x2=4-3=1
y1=3, dev_y1=0
product=1*0=0

Sum is 0+0+0+0=0

Cov(x2,y
