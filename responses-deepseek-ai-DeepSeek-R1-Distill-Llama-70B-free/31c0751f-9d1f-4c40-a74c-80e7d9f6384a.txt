Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says that a chemist has a foil that's about 5e4 atoms thick. An alpha particle must come within 1e-12 cm of a nucleus for deflection. We're supposed to find the probability that an alpha particle will be deflected, given the area of one atom is 4e-16 cm². And the options are given from A to J.

Hmm, alright. So I think this is related to the Rutherford gold foil experiment, where alpha particles are fired at a thin foil and their deflection is observed. The key idea here is probably about calculating the probability based on the target area each nucleus presents.

Wait, the problem says the foil is 5e4 atoms thick. So if each atom is in a layer, and the foil has that many layers, then the total number of atoms the alpha particle might encounter is this thickness multiplied by the number per area. Or maybe I'm getting it wrong. Oh wait, perhaps it's considering each atom as a target, and the probability is about the chance of passing close enough to any nucleus in the foil.

So the approach should be to calculate the effective cross-sectional area each nucleus presents for deflection. Then, find out how many such areas are present in the foil's thickness, and from that, compute the probability.

Let me think of the variables.

The critical distance for deflection is r = 1e-12 cm. So the area around each nucleus where an alpha particle would come close enough is a circle with radius r. The area of such a circle is πr². But wait, the problem statement says the area of one atom is 4e-16 cm². Oh, wait, maybe that's the cross-sectional area of each atom. So each atom has an area of 4e-16 cm². But for deflection, the alpha needs to come within 1e-12 cm. So the effective area for each nucleus is π*(1e-12)^2.

Wait, that makes sense. The area of each nucleus's effective cross-section is πr², where r is 1e-12 cm.

Calculating that: π*(1e-12)^2 = πe-24 cm².

But wait, the given area of one atom is 4e-16 cm², which is much larger than the effective area for deflection. So each atom presents a certain area, but only a smaller part of that leads to deflection.

Wait, no. Each atom's cross-section is 4e-16 cm², which is the area an atom occupies. But the deflection requires the alpha to pass within 1e-12 cm of the nucleus. So the effective area for each nucleus is a circle of radius 1e-12 around it.

So the area for deflection per nucleus is π*(1e-12)^2. Let me calculate that.

π is approximately 3.1416, so 3.1416 * (1e-24) = approx 3.14e-24 cm².

Wait, but the area per atom is 4e-16 cm². So the total number of atoms per cm² would be 1 / (4e-16 cm²) per atom. So the area density of atoms is 2.5e15 atoms/cm².

Now, the foil has a thickness of 5e4 atoms. Hmm, wait—so the thickness is in terms of the number of atoms, not in cm. So I'm thinking that the physical thickness (in cm) would be the number of atoms multiplied by the atomic diameter? Or wait, maybe it's the number of layers. Alternatively, perhaps it's the number of atoms along a line perpendicular to the foil. So the total number of atoms that an alpha particle would pass through would be the foil's thickness in atoms multiplied by the area density.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The number of atoms per unit volume? No, maybe it's easier to think in terms of the total number of atoms along the path of the alpha particle.

Wait, the alpha particle goes through the foil. The foil is 5e4 atoms thick, meaning that the alpha will pass through 5e4 layers of atoms. So the number of atoms the alpha could potentially encounter is the product of the number of atoms per cm² (area) times the number of layers (thickness).

So the number of atoms encountered would be (number per cm²) * (thickness in atoms). Wait, no, perhaps it's (number per cm²) multiplied by the physical area of the beam's path through the foil.

Wait, no, perhaps I should model the problem as follows: The probability P is the product of the number of target nuclei (each with an effective cross-section for deflection) and the effective cross-section area. But I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, another angle. The total cross-sectional area for deflection is the number of atoms along the path multiplied by the effective area per atom. So the probability that a single alpha particle is deflected is the total effective area divided by the total area it traverses.

Wait, the way I've learned it before is that the probability is approximately (N * σ), where N is the number of target nuclei per unit area, and σ is the cross-section per nucleus. But wait, no, that would be for thin targets. Because if the target is too thick, the probability would approach 1, but in reality, with thick targets, the formula would be different.

Wait, perhaps the formula is P = n * σ * d, where n is the number of atoms per volume, σ is the cross-section, and d is the thickness. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, considering that each layer contributes a certain probability.

Alternatively, considering each atom presents an effective area for deflection, and the alpha particle passes through a number of such atoms.

Wait, perhaps the formula is P = 1 - exp(-N * σ), where N is the number of atoms per cm², and σ is the cross-section. But for small probabilities, this can be approximated as P ≈ N * σ.

But given that the foil is 5e4 atoms thick, perhaps the number of atoms along the path is 5e4 times the number of atoms per cm² in a single layer. Wait, maybe not. Let me think.

Each layer has a certain number of atoms per cm². Let me calculate the number of atoms per cm². Since the area per atom is 4e-16 cm², the number per cm² is 1 / (4e-16) = 2.5e15 atoms/cm².

So each cm² has 2.5e15 atoms. The foil is 5e4 atoms thick, which I think means that the alpha particle passes through 5e4 atoms along its path. So the total number of atoms encountered is 5e4 times the number per layer. Wait, no. Wait, no, each layer is a single plane of atoms. The number of layers is 5e4, so the number of atoms along the path would be 5e4 multiplied by the number of atoms per cm² in each layer. Wait, that can't be right because that would give a huge number.

Wait, perhaps the number of atoms along the path is the thickness in atoms (5e4) multiplied by the area density (atoms per cm²). So 5e4 * 2.5e15 = 1.25e20 atoms.

Each of these atoms presents an effective cross-sectional area of π*(1e-12)^2 = 3.14e-24 cm². So the total effective area is 1.25e20 * 3.14e-24 cm².

Let me calculate that: 1.25e20 * 3.14e-24 = (1.25 * 3.14) * 1e-4 = approx 3.925 * 1e-4 = 3.925e-4 cm².

Wait, but the alpha particle is moving through the foil, so the total area it sweeps is the area of the beam, but since we're considering probability, perhaps the comparison is between the total effective area and the total area the particle could pass through.

Wait, perhaps the probability is the ratio of the effective area to the total area. But wait, the total area is the area of the foil that the alpha particle is passing through, which would be the area per atom times the number of atoms per cm². No, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, the probability that a single alpha particle is deflected is the product of the number of atoms it passes by and the probability of deflection per atom.

Wait, that makes more sense. So the number of atoms the alpha passes by is the thickness (5e4 atoms) multiplied by the number of atoms per cm² in each layer (2.5e15). Wait, no, because that would be 5e4 * 2.5e15 = 1.25e20 atoms. But each alpha particle only goes through a certain path, so maybe the number of atoms in that path is 5e4 multiplied by 1 (since each layer has one atom in the path? No, that can't be right.)

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's think differently. The problem says that the foil is 5e4 atoms thick. So, the alpha particle passes through 5e4 atoms. The chance of deflection by each atom is the ratio of the effective area (for deflection) to the area of the atom.

So for each atom, the chance of deflection is (effective area) / (atom area). Then, the probability for each atom is (π r²) / (A), where A is the area per atom.

Wait, that makes sense. Because the alpha particle approaches each atom, and the chance it comes close enough to cause deflection is the ratio of the critical area to the atom's area.

So for each atom, the probability of deflection is (π*(1e-12)^2) / (4e-16) = (π * 1e-24) / 4e-16.

Calculating that: π is about 3.1416, so 3.1416e-24 / 4e-16 = (3.1416 / 4) * 1e-8 = approx 0.7854e-8 = 7.854e-9.

So each atom has a 7.854e-9 chance of deflecting the alpha particle. Since the alpha passes through 5e4 atoms, the total probability would be 5e4 * 7.854e-9.

Wait, but wait—this assumes that the events are independent, but if each deflection is an independent event with low probability, then the total probability is the sum of each individual probability. Because if the chance is small, the probability of multiple deflections is negligible, so the total is just the sum.

So 5e4 * 7.854e-9 = 5e4 * 7.854e-9 = (5 *7.854) * 1e-5 = 39.27e-5 = 3.927e-4.

Wait, that's approximately 0.0003927, or about 3.927e-4. So the chance is roughly 0.03927%. To get the probability as a reciprocal (1 in ...), it's 1 / 0.0003927 ≈ 2546. So approximately 1 in 2546.

Looking at the options, option I is 1 in 2500, which is close. But wait, perhaps I made a calculation mistake.

Let me recalculate the per-atom probability.

Effective area per nucleus: π*(1e-12)^2 = πe-24 ≈ 3.1416e-24 cm².

Area per atom is 4e-16 cm².

So per atom probability: 3.1416e-24 / 4e-16 = (3.1416 /4) * 1e-8 = 0.7854e-8 = 7.854e-9.

Then, for 5e4 atoms: 5e4 *7.854e-9 = 5e4 *7.854e-9 = (5 *7.854) * 1e-5 = 39.27 * 1e-5 = 0.0003927.

Which is 3.927e-4. So 1 divided by 0.0003927 is approximately 2546. So about 1 in 2500.

Looking at the options, option I is 1 in 2500, which matches.

But wait, something seems off. Let me double-check the calculation steps.

Wait, the foil is 5e4 atoms thick. That's 50,000 atoms. Each atom's effective deflection area is π*(1e-12)^2.

So the area per atom for deflection is 3.14e-24 cm², and the area each atom occupies is 4e-16 cm². So the probability per atom is 3.14e-24 / 4e-16 = 0.785e-8, which is 7.85e-9.

Multiply by 5e4 atoms: 5e4 * 7.85e-9 = (5 *7.85) * 1e-5 = 39.25e-5 = 0.0003925.

So 0.0003925 is the probability. So 1/0.0003925 = approx 2548. So about 1 in 2500, which is option I.

Wait, but the options are from A to J. Option I is 1 in 2500, which matches our calculation. So the correct answer should be I, right?

But wait, another angle. The problem says the foil is 5e4 atoms thick. Does that refer to the number of atoms along a single line (like a column), or the number of atoms per unit area?

If it's 5e4 atoms thick, perhaps the number of atoms per unit area is 5e4 times the number per layer. Wait, no, the number per layer is 2.5e15 atoms/cm². So the total number of atoms along the path would be 5e4 (thickness) multiplied by 2.5e15 (atoms per cm²), which gives 1.25e20 atoms.

Wait, that's a different approach. So each alpha particle would pass through 5e4 layers, each layer having 2.5e15 atoms per cm². But the alpha's path is a straight line, so it only passes through one atom per layer on average. So the total number of atoms it interacts with along its path is 5e4.

Wait, perhaps I was correct the first time. So the number of atoms is 5e4. So the probability is 5e4 * (π*(1e-12)^2) / (4e-16).

Which is 5e4 * (3.14e-24) / (4e-16) = 5e4 * (3.14 /4 )e-8.

3.14/4 is about 0.785, so 0.785e-8 *5e4 = 0.785e-8 *5e4 = 0.785 *5 *1e-4 = 3.925e-4.

Same result. So 1/0.0003925≈2548, so 1 in 2500, which is option I.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up atoms per cm² and atoms along the path.

Alternative approach: The total number of atoms in the path is the thickness (5e4 atoms) multiplied by the number of atoms per cm² (2.5e15), but that would give 5e4 *2.5e15 = 1.25e20 atoms. Then, each has a cross-section of 3.14e-24 cm². So the total effective area is 1.25e20 *3.14e-24 = 3.925e-4 cm².

The total area that the alpha particle sweeps through is the product of the beam area (which is not given) and the physical thickness. Wait, but without knowing the beam area, maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, the probability is the total effective area divided by the total area the alpha could pass through. But without knowing the beam's area, perhaps it's better to think in terms of per atom probability.

Hmm, I think my initial approach is correct, so the answer is I: 1 in 2500.

To determine the probability that an alpha particle will be deflected by a nucleus in the foil, we start by analyzing the given data:

1. **Foil thickness**: The foil is approximately \( 5 \times 10^4 \) atoms thick. This means the alpha particle will pass through \( 5 \times 10^4 \) layers of atoms.

2. **Area per atom**: The cross-sectional area of one atom is given as \( 4 \times 10^{-16} \, \text{cm}^2 \). This allows us to calculate the number of atoms per unit area as:
   \[
   \text{Number of atoms per cm}^2 = \frac{1}{4 \times 10^{-16}} = 2.5 \times 10^{15} \, \text{atoms/cm}^2.
   \]

3. **Effective cross-sectional area for deflection**: An alpha particle must come within \( 10^{-12} \, \text{cm} \) of a nucleus for deflection to occur. The effective cross-sectional area for deflection is a circle with radius \( r = 10^{-12} \, \text{cm} \), so:
   \[
   \text{Effective area per nucleus} = \pi r^2 = \pi (10^{-12})^2 = \pi \times 10^{-24} \, \text{cm}^2 \approx 3.14 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{cm}^2.
   \]

4. **Probability of deflection per atom**: The probability that an alpha particle will be deflected by a single atom is the ratio of the effective cross-sectional area for deflection to the total cross-sectional area of the atom:
   \[
   P_{\text{single atom}} = \frac{\text{Effective area}}{\text{Atom area}} = \frac{3.14 \times 10^{-24}}{4 \times 10^{-16}} = 7.85 \times 10^{-9}.
   \]

5. **Total probability of deflection**: Since the alpha particle passes through \( 5 \times 10^4 \) atoms, the total probability of deflection is the product of the single-atom probability and
