Okay, so I need to figure out this real property law question. Let's see, the question is about mortgages, recording, and subsequent conveyances. Hmm.

Alright, let's break down the events step by step. 

First, in 1993, a woman mortgages a tract of land to a mortgage company. The mortgage is to secure a note for $25,000, due December 31, 1993, with 9.5% interest. So, that's a mortgage lien on the property.

Second, in 1996, the mortgage company records the mortgage. Wait, so the mortgage was created in 1993 but recorded in 1996. I remember that recording statutes determine priority. Since the mortgage was recorded in 1996, any subsequent purchasers would be on notice, but prior interests would have priority. But in this case, there were no other conveyances yet, I think.

Third, in 2007, the woman signs a writing delivered to her daughter, promising to convey the land via quitclaim deed and pay the mortgage debt when due. So, that's a promise to convey in the future and to pay off the mortgage. But what kind of interest does the daughter have here? It's a contract to convey, so maybe an equitable interest.

Fourth, in 2008, the woman delivers a quitclaim deed to the daughter without mentioning the mortgage. So, now the daughter has the deed, but the mortgage isn't referenced. 

Now, the woman defaults on the mortgage. What happens? The mortgage company can foreclosure, right? But how does the daughter fit into this?

Wait, the key here is the recording of the mortgage and the daughter's interest. The mortgage was recorded in 1996, which is before the 2007 promise and the 2008 conveyance. So when the daughter took the quitclaim deed in 2008, she had constructive notice of the mortgage because it was recorded. 

But what about the 2007 promise? So the woman promised to pay the mortgage debt. If she later conveys the property, does the daughter take subject to the mortgage, or does she take free and clear? Hmm. A quitclaim deed conveys whatever interest the grantor has, which in this case was subject to the mortgage. So the daughter would take the land subject to the mortgage. But wait, the woman also promised to pay the mortgage debt. So perhaps the daughter could hold the woman to that promise.

Wait, in real estate, when a grantor conveys property with a mortgage, the grantee typically takes subject to the mortgage unless there's an assumption of the mortgage. But in this case, the woman didn't assume the mortgage; she just conveyed with a quitclaim. So the daughter takes the property subject to the mortgage. But the woman had separately promised to pay the mortgage debt. So that's a contractual obligation between the woman and the daughter. If the woman defaults, the mortgage company can foreclose, and the daughter's interest is affected. But can the daughter go after the woman for breaching the promise to pay the mortgage?

Also, the mortgage was recorded before the daughter took the deed, so the daughter had notice and takes the property subject to the mortgage. But the woman also had a contractual obligation to pay the mortgage. So when the woman defaults, the mortgage company can go after the woman (the mortgagor), and perhaps the daughter as well if the mortgage allows for that. Wait, no, the mortgage is the woman's debt. The daughter isn't personally liable unless she assumed the mortgage, which she didn't. She just got a quitclaim.

Wait, the mortgage is a lien on the property. When the woman defaults, the mortgage company can foreclose on the property. The daughter now owns the property, so she could lose it in foreclosure. But she might have a claim against her mother for breach of the 2007 promise to pay the mortgage. So the daughter could sue the woman for not fulfilling that promise, which was a contractual obligation.

So, the mortgage company can go after the woman for the debt. The daughter can go after the woman for breaching the contract to pay the mortgage. So both have causes of action against the woman.

Wait, let's look at the options:

Option A: Mortgage company vs both woman and daughter. But the daughter didn't assume the mortgage, so the mortgage company can't go after her personally. They can go after the property, but the daughter isn't personally liable. So A might not be correct.

Option D: Only mortgage company has cause against woman. But the daughter might have a cause against the woman for breach of contract.

Option E: Both daughter and mortgage company have causes against the woman. That seems right.

Wait, but what about the recording? The mortgage was recorded before the conveyance to the daughter, so the daughter takes subject to the mortgage. But the woman's promise to pay the debt—so when the debt is not paid, the mortgage company can foreclose, and the daughter could lose the property. So the daughter might have a claim against the woman for the loss, based on the woman's promise. So yes, the daughter can sue the woman.

So the mortgage company can sue the woman for the debt, and the daughter can sue the woman for breach of contract (the 2007 promise). So E is the option where both have causes against the woman.

Alternatively, let me think again. The mortgage company has a cause against the woman because she's the mortgagor. The daughter has a cause against the woman because she promised to pay the debt, which she didn't. So yes, E is correct.

Wait, another angle: when the woman delivered the quitclaim deed, she didn't transfer the mortgage obligation. So the daughter isn't liable on the mortgage. But the mortgage is still a lien on the property. So when the woman defaults, the mortgage company can foreclose, and the daughter's interest is subject to that. So the daughter might lose the property, but she can sue her mother for damages based on the promise to pay the mortgage.

So both have causes of action against the woman. So the answer should be E.

In this scenario, the woman mortgaged the property in 1993, and the mortgage was recorded in 1996. This recording put subsequent purchasers on notice of the mortgage lien. In 2007, the woman promised her daughter in writing to convey the property by quitclaim deed and to pay the mortgage debt when it came due. However, in 2008, the woman delivered a quitclaim deed to the daughter without referencing the mortgage. A quitclaim deed transfers whatever interest the grantor has at the time, and since the mortgage was already recorded, the daughter took the property subject to the mortgage lien.

When the woman defaulted on the mortgage, the mortgage company, as the holder of the mortgage lien, has a cause of action against the woman to enforce the debt. The daughter, on the other hand, has a cause of action against the woman for breach of the 2007 contractual promise to pay the mortgage debt. The daughter is not personally liable for the mortgage debt because she did not assume it, but she can hold the woman accountable for failing to fulfill her promise.

Thus, both the mortgage company and the daughter have causes of action against the woman.
