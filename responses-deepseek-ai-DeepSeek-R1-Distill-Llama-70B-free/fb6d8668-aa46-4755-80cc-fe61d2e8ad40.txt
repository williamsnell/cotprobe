Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure out the valence of element X. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand all the details.

The problem says that the atomic weight of element X is 58.7. Then, 7.34 grams of X displaces 0.25 grams of hydrogen from hydrochloric acid (HCl). I need to find the valence of X from the given options.

Hmm, valence. Right, valence refers to the combining capacity of an element, basically the number of electrons it can lose, gain, or share to form a chemical bond. In this context, since we're dealing with displacement from an acid, it's probably a metal displacing hydrogen, so we're looking for a positive valence.

Alright, so the first step is probably to figure out the moles involved. Moles are essential because they relate the mass of a substance to its chemical amount, allowing us to find ratios.

So, let's start by calculating the moles of hydrogen displaced. The mass of hydrogen is 0.25 grams. The atomic weight of hydrogen is about 1 g/mol. So moles of H2 would be mass divided by molar mass. Wait, wait, but wait—hydrogen gas is H2. So perhaps I need to consider that.

Wait, but the problem says 0.25 grams of hydrogen, so that's H2 or just H? Because when metals displace hydrogen from acids, they produce hydrogen gas, which is H2. So the 0.25 grams would be H2.

So, molar mass of H2 is 2 g/mol. Therefore, moles of H2 displaced would be 0.25 g / 2 g/mol = 0.125 mol.

Wait, but let me double-check. If 0.25 g is H2, then yes, that's correct. If it were just H atoms, the mass would be 0.25 g, which would be 0.25 / 1 = 0.25 mol of H atoms, but since each molecule is H2, that's 0.125 mol of H2 molecules.

Wait, no, perhaps another approach. Let me think again. The reaction when a metal displaces hydrogen from HCl is typically: M + HCl → MCl + H2. So for each mole of M, a certain amount of H2 is produced.

So, let's find out how many moles of X and H2 we have.

First, moles of X: the mass is 7.34 grams, atomic weight is 58.7 g/mol. So moles of X = 7.34 / 58.7.

Let me calculate that. 7.34 divided by 58.7. Let's see, 58.7 times 0.125 is about 7.3375. Oh, wait, that's close to 7.34. So 7.34 /58.7 ≈ 0.125 mol. So moles of X = approximately 0.125 moles.

Moles of H2 displaced: 0.25 g H2 / 2 g/mol = 0.125 mol of H2. So moles of H2 is 0.125.

Now, the reaction between X and HCl produces XCl and H2. Let's assume X is a metal with a valence of n+. So the reaction would be:

X + HCl → XCl_n + H2↑

Wait, no. Let me write the balanced equation.

If X has a valency of +n, then XCl would be XCl_n. The reaction would be:

2 X + 2n HCl → 2 XCl_n + n H2↑

Wait, maybe better to write it for one mole of X. Let's say the reaction is:

X + n HCl → XCl_n + (n/2) H2↑

Wait, no. Let's think about it. For a metal with valency +n, each X atom would lose n electrons, and each H+ gains one electron to become H2. So the number of electrons transferred would relate to the moles of X and H2.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to use stoichiometry based on the moles we have.

We have moles of X = 0.125, moles of H2 = 0.125.

In the reaction, each mole of X would produce a certain amount of H2. Let's find the ratio.

Let me think of the general reaction where a metal displaces hydrogen from acid.

If the metal has a valency of +n, then the reaction would be:

(1/n) X + H+ → (1/n) X^n+ + (1/2) H2↑

Wait, no, perhaps better to write it as:

X + n H+ → X^n+ + (n/2) H2↑

So for each mole of X, (n/2) moles of H2 are produced.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me correct that. Let's take the example of magnesium (valency +2) displacing H2.

The reaction is Mg + 2 HCl → MgCl2 + H2↑

So 1 mole of Mg produces 1 mole of H2. But according to the equation, 1 mole of Mg gives 1 mole of H2. So for n=+2, 1 mole of X gives 0.5 moles of H2? No, that can't be right, because in the equation, 1 mole of Mg gives 1 mole of H2.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of electrons. For Mg, which has a +2 charge, each Mg atom loses 2 electrons. Each H+ gains 2 electrons (since 2 H+ → H2, each H+ gains one electron, so two electrons per H2 molecule).

So the number of electrons lost by X is n per atom. The number of electrons gained by H+ is 2 per H2 molecule.

So the mole ratio of X to H2 is n : 1, because X loses n electrons per atom, and each H2 requires 2 electrons (from two H+ ions). So for each H2 molecule, 2 electrons are needed. So for each X atom, n electrons are lost. So the ratio of X to H2 is n : (number of H2 molecules). So for each X atom, it would produce (n/2) H2 molecules.

Wait, perhaps that's a better way to think. So moles of X × n = 2 × moles of H2.

Because each X atom donates n electrons, and each H2 molecule requires 2 electrons.

So, the formula would be: moles of X × valency of X = 2 × moles of H2.

Yes, that makes sense. So:

moles_X × n = 2 × moles_H2

We have moles_X = 0.125 mol, and moles_H2 = 0.125 mol.

Plugging in:

0.125 × n = 2 × 0.125

Simplify:

0.125n = 0.25

Divide both sides by 0.125:

n = 0.25 / 0.125 = 2.

So the valency of X is +2.

Wait, but let me double-check that. If n=2, then each mole of X gives 2 moles of electrons, and each H2 requires 2 electrons, so moles of X × 2 = 2 × moles of H2.

So 0.125 × 2 = 0.25, which equals 2 × 0.125 = 0.25. So yes, that works.

So the valence is +2. Looking at the options, the option H is +2.

To determine the valence of element X, we analyze the reaction where 7.34 g of X displaces 0.25 g of hydrogen (H₂) from hydrochloric acid (HCl). The atomic weight of X is given as 58.7 g/mol, and the molar mass of H₂ is 2 g/mol.

1. **Calculate moles of X and H₂:**
   - Moles of X = mass of X / atomic weight = \( \frac{7.34}{58.7} \approx 0.125 \, \text{mol} \).
   - Moles of H₂ = mass of H₂ / molar mass = \( \frac{0.25}{2} = 0.125 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Relate moles of X and H₂ to determine valency:**
   - In the reaction, each mole of X displaces a certain amount of H₂. For a metal with valency \( n \), the relationship is:
     \[
     \text{moles of X} \times n = 2 \times \text{moles of H₂}
     \]
     This is because each H₂ molecule requires 2 electrons, and each X atom donates \( n \) electrons.

   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     0.125 \times n = 2 \times 0.125
     \]
     \[
     n = \frac{0.25}{0.125} = 2
     \]

Thus, the valence of element X is \( +2 \).

From the given options, the correct answer is **H: +2**.
