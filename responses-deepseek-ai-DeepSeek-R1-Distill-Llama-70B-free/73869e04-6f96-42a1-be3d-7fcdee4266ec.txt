Okay, so I've got this problem where Mr. Glass borrowed $250 from a finance company. He needs to repay it in five monthly installments. The interest is calculated at 3% per month on the first $150 and 2% per month on any amount over $150. I need to find the total interest he'll pay.

Hmm, wait. I'm a bit confused about how the interest is applied. Is the interest calculated each month on the remaining balance, or is it a simple interest on each portion of the loan? Let me think.

The problem states it's 3% a month on the first $150 and 2% on any part over $150. So, I think the way it works is that for each month, the interest is calculated on the outstanding balance, which might be split into two parts: the first $150 and the amount over $150.

Wait, but since he's paying in installments, the balance reduces each month. But the question is, does the split between the two interest rates apply each month based on the remaining balance, or is it only applied once at the beginning?

I think it's the latter. Because the loan is $250, which is more than $150, so each month, the interest is calculated as 3% on $150 and 2% on the remaining $100. But wait, that's only the first month. Because each month he's paying some amount, so the principal reduces each time.

Wait, no. The way the problem is phrased might be that the interest is calculated each month on the outstanding balance. So, for the first part of the loan (the initial $150), the interest is 3% per month, and for the part over $150, it's 2% per month. But the key is whether these rates apply to the original amounts or the remaining balance each month.

Alternatively, perhaps the interest is calculated each month on the current outstanding balance, but the rates are applied based on the tiers. So, every month, the interest is 3% on the first $150 of the current balance and 2% on any part over $150 of the current balance.

Wait, but in this case, the loan is being paid back in installments. So each month, part of the payment goes to interest and part to principal. But I'm not told the monthly payment amount. So perhaps I need to calculate the interest for each month based on the outstanding balance each month.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give the monthly payment amount. It just says he repays $250 in five monthly installments. So each installment is $250 /5 = $50 per month. Wait, no, that's not necessarily correct because the interest is applied each month, so the total amount paid would be more than $250. Because each month, part of the payment goes to interest, and part to principal.

Wait, but the problem says he agreed to repay the $250 in five monthly installments. So perhaps each installment is the same amount, which includes principal plus interest. But without knowing the monthly payment, how can I calculate the interest?

Alternatively, perhaps the interest is calculated upfront, and each month's payment is split into principal and interest. But without knowing the payment amount, I'm stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the interest is calculated each month on the remaining principal, and the repayment is fixed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simpler. Maybe the interest is calculated each month on the original amounts. So, the first $150 is charged 3% per month, and the remaining $100 is charged 2% per month, each month for five months.

Wait, but that would be the case if the interest was simple interest on each portion. So for the first $150, each month 3% interest is applied, so over five months, that's 15%. For the $100, 2% each month, so 10% over five months.

Let me calculate that. $150 * (3% *5) = 150 * 0.15 = $22.50. $100 * (2% *5) = 100 * 0.10 = $10. So total interest would be $32.50. But none of the options match that. So that can't be right.

Wait, but the options don't have $32.50. So perhaps that approach is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the interest is calculated each month on the outstanding balance, which decreases as he makes payments.

Wait, but since he's repaying in five installments, each payment would reduce the principal. So perhaps it's an installment loan with each payment consisting of principal and interest.

But without knowing the monthly payment amount, I can't compute the exact interest each month. Hmm, maybe I'm supposed to assume that the interest is calculated each month on the remaining balance, split into the two tiers.

Wait, but perhaps I can model it as each month's interest being 3% on the first $150 of the current balance and 2% on any amount over $150. But as he makes payments, the balance reduces.

Wait, let's try to model this. Let's say the initial loan is $250.

Each month, he makes a payment. Let's say each payment is the same amount. Let's denote each monthly payment as P.

But we don't know P. However, the total amount paid over five months is 5P, which should equal the initial principal ($250) plus total interest (I). So 5P = 250 + I. But without knowing P or I, this is tricky.

Alternatively, perhaps the interest is calculated each month as follows: For each month, the interest is 3% on the first $150 of the outstanding balance and 2% on the rest.

Wait, but the outstanding balance decreases each month. So let's try to compute the interest each month and sum it up.

Let me try to compute this step by step.

Month 1:
Outstanding balance: $250.

Interest calculation:
First $150: 3% of 150 = 4.50
Remaining $100: 2% of 100 = 2.00
Total interest for month 1: 4.50 + 2.00 = $6.50
Payment made: Let's say he pays P, which is the fixed monthly payment. But we don't know P yet. Hmm, this complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps each payment is the same, and the payment includes principal and interest.

Wait, perhaps the way to approach this is to calculate the monthly payment first. Since he's repaying the loan in five equal monthly installments with interest, we can model this as an amortizing loan.

The formula for the monthly payment (P) on a loan is:

P = [ r * PV ] / [1 - (1 + r)^-n ]

Where:
r = monthly interest rate
PV = present value (loan amount)
n = number of payments

But wait, the interest rate isn't a flat rate here; it's split into two tiers. So this complicates the calculation because each month's interest depends on the outstanding balance.

Alternatively, perhaps the interest each month is calculated as 3% on the first $150 and 2% on any over $150, but the payment is applied to reduce the principal.

Wait, but without knowing the payment structure, perhaps the interest is calculated each month on the current balance, and each payment is equal to the interest plus some principal.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to be simpler. Maybe it's a simple interest calculation where the interest each month is based on the initial tiers, regardless of the payments. But that doesn't make much sense because as he pays down the principal, the outstanding balance decreases.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the interest is applied each month on the original tiers, not the current balance. So each month, 3% is charged on the first $150, and 2% on the next $100, regardless of payments. But that would lead to the same interest each month, which doesn't account for the reducing balance.

Wait, but in the first approach, where each month's interest is based on the current balance, the interest would decrease as he pays down the principal.

But without knowing the monthly payment, it's hard to model this. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that each month, the interest is calculated on the initial amounts, not the remaining balance. So for each of the five months, the interest is 3% on $150 (which is $4.50) and 2% on $100 (which is $2), totaling $6.50 per month. Over five months, that's 5 * $6.50 = $32.50. But that's not one of the options, so that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the interest is calculated only once, at the beginning, so total interest would be 3% of 150 plus 2% of 100, which is $4.50 + $2 = $6.50 total. But that's also not an option. So that can't be correct.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let me read the question again. It says he repays $250 in five monthly installments, with interest at 3% a month on the first $150 and 2% a month on any part over $150. So perhaps the interest is calculated each month on the outstanding balance, and the interest is the sum of the two parts each month.

Wait, but without knowing the payment, how can I compute the interest each month? Alternatively, perhaps each installment is $50, since 250/5 is 50, but that would ignore the interest, which is part of each payment. So the total amount paid would be more than 250, but the question is about the interest.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that each month, the interest is calculated on the remaining principal, but the interest rates are applied to the initial tiers. So, for example, in the first month, the outstanding balance is $250, so interest is 3% on 150 and 2% on 100, total $6.50. Then, the payment would cover the interest plus some principal. But without knowing the payment amount, I can't proceed.

Unless the payment is such that each month, the payment is interest plus a fixed principal. But I'm not told that.

Alternatively, perhaps each payment is the same, and the interest is calculated each month on the remaining balance, split into the two tiers.

Wait, maybe the way to approach this is to calculate the interest for each month, considering that each payment reduces the principal, and the next month's interest is calculated on the new balance, again split into the two tiers.

But without the payment amount, how can I do that? Alternatively, perhaps the interest is calculated as simple interest each month on the initial amounts, but that's not accounting for the reducing balance.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me try another approach. Since he's paying in five equal installments, each of P dollars. Each payment includes both principal and interest.

The total amount paid is 5P, which equals 250 plus the total interest.

But to find P, I need to model the payments. Each payment P is applied to the outstanding balance, which is the principal plus the accumulated interest.

Wait, but modeling this for five months would require calculating each month's interest, subtracting the principal part of the payment, and so on. It's a bit involved.

Alternatively, perhaps the interest is calculated each month on the original $250, split into the two tiers. So each month, interest is 3% of 150 (4.50) plus 2% of 100 (2.00), totaling 6.50 per month. Over five months, that's 5 * 6.50 = 32.50. But again, that's not one of the options. So perhaps that's not the right approach.

Wait, maybe the interest is only applied once, at the beginning, but that doesn't make sense because it's a monthly rate. So perhaps the interest is calculated each month on the remaining balance, and the payment each month is applied first to interest, then to principal.

Wait, perhaps I can model this as an amortization schedule, but it's a bit time-consuming. Let's try.

Let me assume that each monthly payment is P, which is the same each month. The total amount to pay back is 250 plus interest. But without knowing P, I can't compute it directly. Alternatively, perhaps the interest is calculated each month on the remaining balance, split into the two tiers.

Let me outline the process:

Each month, the interest is calculated as follows:

- On the first $150 of the outstanding balance: 3% per month.
- On the amount over $150: 2% per month.

Then, the payment P is made, which covers the interest plus some principal.

Wait, but since the payment is fixed, I think I can model this as a series of payments where each payment first covers the interest, and the remainder reduces the principal.

But without knowing P, I can't compute the exact interest each month. Alternatively, perhaps I can find P such that after five payments, the principal is zero.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe I can make an assumption that the interest each month is based on the initial split, regardless of the payments. But that's not accurate because as the principal reduces, the split would change.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved by considering that each month, the interest is calculated on the current balance, which is split into two parts: the first $150 and the rest. But as payments are made, the balance decreases.

Wait, let me try to compute it step by step for each month.

Initial loan: $250.

Month 1:
Interest = 3% of 150 = 4.50
Plus 2% of 100 = 2.00
Total interest = 6.50
Payment made: P
So, principal paid = P - 6.50
New balance = 250 - (P - 6.50) = 250 - P +6.50 = 256.50 - P

Month 2:
Outstanding balance is 256.50 - P.

Now, this balance may be more or less than $150. Depending on P, the split into the two tiers could change.

Wait, but without knowing P, I can't proceed. So perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the problem is intended to be simpler, and the interest is calculated each month on the original $250, split into the two tiers, regardless of the payments. So each month, it's 6.50 in interest, times 5 months, totaling 32.50. But that's not an option.

Wait, the options are A: $23, B:18, C:24, etc. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait another approach: perhaps the interest is calculated only once, as simple interest on each portion. So 3% on 150 for five months is 15%, which is 22.50, and 2% on 100 for five months is 10%, which is 10. So total interest is 32.50. But again, that's not an option.

Hmm, perhaps the interest is calculated per annum instead of per month. But the question says 3% a month and 2% a month, so that's not it.

Wait, maybe the loan is for five months, and the interest is simple interest on each portion. So 3% per month on 150 for 5 months is 15%, which is 22.50. 2% per month on 100 for 5 months is 10, totaling 32.50. But again, not an option.

Wait, perhaps the interest is compound interest. Let's try that.

For the first $150:

Each month, 3% interest compounded.

After 5 months: 150*(1.03)^5 -150 = 150*(1.03)^5 -150. Let me compute that.

1.03^5 is approximately 1.15927. So 150*1.15927 = 173.89. Subtract 150 gives 23.89.

For the $100:

2% per month compounded for 5 months.

100*(1.02)^5 -100 = 100*(1.04040...) -100 ≈ 104.08. So interest is about 4.08.

Total interest: 23.89 + 4.08 ≈ 27.97, approximately $28. But the options don't have $28. The closest is option J: $27.

Wait, but maybe the interest isn't compounded. The problem says "interest at 3% a month", which could imply simple interest.

So, for simple interest:

150 * 0.03 *5 = 22.50

100 * 0.02 *5 = 10

Total: 32.50. Again, not an option.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the interest is applied each month on the remaining balance, but the tiers are based on the original loan. So for each month, the interest is 3% on the first 150 of the original 250 and 2% on the remaining 100, regardless of the payments. So each month, it's 6.50 in interest, times 5, gives 32.50. But again, not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the interest is applied only once, at the end, but that's unlikely as it's a monthly rate.

Wait, maybe the total interest is the sum of the interest on each portion, but calculated as simple interest for one month only. So 4.50 + 2 = 6.50 total interest. But that's only for one month, and the problem says five installments, so perhaps the interest is 6.50 times 5 = 32.50 again.

Wait, but the options don't include that. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the interest is calculated on the original principal only once, not each month. So 3% of 150 is 4.50, and 2% of 100 is 2.00, total 6.50, but only once, so total interest is 6.50. But that's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps the interest is calculated monthly, but on the original tiers, so each month the interest is 6.50, but the payment each month includes this interest plus principal. So over five months, the total interest would be 5 * 6.50 = 32.50. But that's not an option.

Wait, looking at the options, maybe option J is $27. Let me see if that's possible.

Wait, perhaps the interest is calculated each month on the current balance, but the tiers are based on the original loan. So for each month, the first $150 of the current balance is charged 3%, and any over $150 is charged 2%. Let me model this for each month, assuming that each payment is $50 (since 250/5=50), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps each payment is the same, and the interest is calculated on the remaining balance each month.

Let's try this:

Loan: $250

Each payment: P (unknown)

Each month, interest is calculated as:

If balance >150: 3% on first 150, 2%
