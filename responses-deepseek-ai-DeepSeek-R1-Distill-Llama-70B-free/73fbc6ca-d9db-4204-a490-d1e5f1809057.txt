Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about equilibrium constants. Hmm, I remember that the equilibrium constant K is calculated using the concentrations of the products and reactants at equilibrium, each raised to the power of their stoichiometric coefficients. Right, the formula is K = [products]^coefficients / [reactants]^coefficients. 

The reaction given is 2H2S(g) â‡Œ 2H2(g) + S2(g). So the stoichiometric coefficients are 2 for H2S, 2 for H2, and 1 for S2. Wait, no, wait. Let me look again. The reaction is written as 2 moles of H2S decomposing into 2 moles of H2 and 1 mole of S2. So the coefficients are 2, 2, and 1.

The problem states that the reaction is allowed to proceed to equilibrium in a 2-liter vessel. The analysis shows 1.0 mole of H2S, 0.20 mole of H2, and 0.80 mole of S2. I need to calculate K.

First, I think I should find the concentrations of each substance. Since concentration is moles per liter, I'll divide each by 2 liters.

So, [H2S] = 1.0 mol / 2 L = 0.5 M.
[H2] = 0.20 / 2 = 0.10 M.
[S2] = 0.80 / 2 = 0.40 M.

Wait, but I should make sure these are the equilibrium concentrations. Oh, right, because the reaction has proceeded to equilibrium, so yes, these are the values at equilibrium.

Now, the expression for K should be products over reactants. So K = ([H2]^2 [S2]^1) / [H2S]^2.

Plugging the numbers in: [H2]^2 is (0.10)^2 = 0.01. [S2] is 0.40. Multiply those together: 0.01 * 0.40 = 0.004. Then, [H2S]^2 is (0.5)^2 = 0.25. So K = 0.004 / 0.25.

Hmm, dividing 0.004 by 0.25. Let me calculate that. 0.004 divided by 0.25 is the same as 0.004 * 4, because 1/0.25 is 4. So 0.004 * 4 is 0.016. 

Wait, let me double-check the calculation. 0.25 is 1/4, so 0.004 divided by (1/4) is 0.004 *4 = 0.016. Yes, that's correct.

Looking at the options, option C is 0.016. So I think that's the right answer.

To calculate the equilibrium constant \( K \) for the reaction \( 2\text{H}_2\text{S}(g) \rightleftharpoons 2\text{H}_2(g) + \text{S}_2(g) \), we use the formula:

\[
K = \frac{[\text{H}_2]^2 [\text{S}_2]}{[\text{H}_2\text{S}]^2}
\]

The equilibrium concentrations are determined by dividing the given moles by the volume of the reaction vessel (2 liters):

\[
[\text{H}_2\text{S}] = \frac{1.0}{2} = 0.5 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{H}_2] = \frac{0.20}{2} = 0.10 \, \text{M}, \quad [\text{S}_2] = \frac{0.80}{2} = 0.40 \, \text{M}.
\]

Substituting these values into the equilibrium expression:

\[
K = \frac{(0.10)^2 (0.40)}{(0.5)^2} = \frac{(0.01)(0.40)}{0.25} = \frac{0.004}{0.25} = 0.016.
\]

Thus, the equilibrium constant \( K \) is \( 0.016 \). Comparing this result to the given options, the correct answer is:

**C: 0.016**
