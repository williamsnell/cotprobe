Question:

A shop owner domiciled in State A sued a distributor in a federal district court in State A for breach of a contract. The shop owner sought $100,000 in damages for allegedly defective goods that the distributor had provided under the contract. The distributor is incorporated in State B, with its principal place of business in State C. The distributor brought in as a third-party defendant the wholesaler that had provided the goods to the distributor, alleging that the wholesaler had a duty to indemnify the distributor for any damages recovered by the shop owner. The wholesaler is incorporated in State B, with its principal place of business in State A. The wholesaler has asserted a $60,000 counterclaim against the distributor for payment for the goods at issue, and the distributor has moved to dismiss the counterclaim for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Should the motion to dismiss be granted?

Options:

A: No, because the distributor and the wholesaler conduct business in different states.
B: Yes, because there is no diversity of citizenship between the distributor and the wholesaler.
C: Yes, because the wholesaler's counterclaim is not directly related to the distributor's claim.
D: No, because the wholesaler's and the distributor's principal places of business are diverse.
E: No, because the distributor has invoked the jurisdiction of the court.
F: Yes, because the amount in controversy does not meet the jurisdictional limit.
G: Yes, because the wholesaler's counterclaim is not a compulsory counterclaim.
H: No, because the wholesaler and distributor are incorporated in the same state.
I: No, because there is supplemental jurisdiction over the wholesaler's counterclaim.
J: Yes, because there is no diversity of citizenship between the shop owner and the wholesaler.

Okay, so I've got this question about federal jurisdiction, specifically involving diversity jurisdiction and possibly supplemental jurisdiction. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the setup: A shop owner from State A sued a distributor in federal court in State A for breach of contract, seeking $100,000. The distributor is incorporated in State B but has its principal place of business in State C. Then, the distributor brings in a third-party defendant, the wholesaler, claiming the wholesaler should indemnify them if they have to pay the shop owner. Now, the wholesaler is incorporated in State B but has its principal place of business in State A. The wholesaler has a $60,000 counterclaim against the distributor for payment on the goods. The distributor moves to dismiss this counterclaim for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.

So the question is whether the motion should be granted. The options are from A to J.

I remember that when dealing with third-party claims and counterclaims, the jurisdictional analysis can get a bit tricky. Let me think about the possible jurisdictional bases here.

The main case is based on diversity jurisdiction because the shop owner is from State A and the distributor is from State B (since it's incorporated there, but wait, for diversity, the test is citizenship, which for corporations is both the state of incorporation and the principal place of business. Wait, no, actually, for diversity jurisdiction, a corporation is a citizen of every state where it's incorporated and the state where it has its principal place of business. So the distributor is a citizen of State B and State C, and the shop owner is a citizen of State A. So the original suit meets diversity because State A vs. State B or C, and the amount is over $75,000.

Now, the distributor brings in the wholesaler as a third-party defendant. The wholesaler is incorporated in State B and has its principal place of business in State A, so its citizenship would be State B and State A. 

The wholesaler then brings a counterclaim against the distributor for $60,000. The question is whether the court has jurisdiction over this counterclaim.

Possible jurisdictional bases: diversity jurisdiction or supplemental jurisdiction.

Looking at diversity first: The wholesaler is a citizen of State B and State A. The distributor is a citizen of State B and State C. So between the wholesaler and the distributor, do they have diverse citizenship?

The wholesaler's citizenship includes State A and State B. The distributor's is State B and State C. So both are citizens of State B. That means they share a common state of citizenship—State B. So there's no diversity between them because they're both from State B. Therefore, diversity jurisdiction doesn't apply to the counterclaim.

Alternatively, could the court exercise supplemental jurisdiction? Supplemental jurisdiction applies to claims that are part of the same case or controversy. 28 U.S.C. § 1367. But, wait, the counterclaim here is being asserted by the wholesaler against the distributor. Since the main claim is between the shop owner (State A) and the distributor (State B and C), the third-party claim is the distributor vs. the wholesaler. 

But the counterclaim is a separate claim. So the issue is whether the court can exercise jurisdiction over it. Since the main claim is based on diversity, the court can exercise supplemental jurisdiction over claims that are part of the same case or controversy, but only if they don't require a separate jurisdictional basis. However, in this case, the counterclaim is between two parties (distributor and wholesaler) who are not diverse. So the court would have to determine if the counterclaim is sufficiently related to the main action.

Wait, but the counterclaim is for payment for the goods, which seems related to the main breach of contract claim. The main claim is about defective goods, and the counterclaim is about payment for those same goods. So they are part of the same transaction or occurrence. Therefore, the court could exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the counterclaim.

Wait, but I think I might be mixing up some concepts. Let me clarify. The third-party claim by the distributor against the wholesaler is for indemnification, which is part of the same case. The counterclaim by the wholesaler against the distributor is a separate claim, but it arises from the same transaction—the supply of goods. 

So if the court has original jurisdiction over the main case, it can exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the counterclaim if it's part of the same case or controversy. Since the counterclaim arises from the same set of facts, the court may have supplemental jurisdiction. 

But wait, what if the amount in controversy is less than the jurisdictional requirement? The counterclaim is $60,000, which is below the $75,000 threshold for diversity jurisdiction. However, when supplemental jurisdiction applies, the amount doesn't matter because it's not based on diversity but rather on being part of the same case. So the court can hear it regardless of the amount.

So, the distributor is moving to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. If the court has supplemental jurisdiction over the counterclaim, the motion should be denied. 

Looking at the options:

Option I says: No, because there is supplemental jurisdiction over the wholesaler's counterclaim. That seems correct.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option B: Yes, because there's no diversity between distributor and wholesaler. That's true because both are citizens of State B. So diversity jurisdiction doesn't apply. But if supplemental applies, then the court can still hear the case. So the motion to dismiss would be denied because the court has jurisdiction via supplemental. 

Wait, but does the court have the power to exercise supplemental jurisdiction here? Let me make sure. The main claim is a diversity case. The third-party claim and the counterclaim are all part of the same case. So yes, the court can exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the counterclaim.

So the motion should not be granted. So the correct answer would be either I or another option that reflects that. Looking again, option I says No because of supplemental jurisdiction. So that's the right choice.

Wait, but another point: the counterclaim is compulsory. A compulsory counterclaim is one that arises from the same transaction or occurrence. If it's compulsory, then the court must hear it under supplemental jurisdiction. If it's not, then the court has discretion. But in this case, it's a counterclaim for payment on the same goods, so it's part of the same transaction, making it compulsory. So the court must exercise jurisdiction over it under 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a). 

So the answer is that the motion should not be granted, so the correct option is I: No, because there is supplemental jurisdiction.

The question revolves around whether the federal court has subject-matter jurisdiction over the wholesaler's $60,000 counterclaim against the distributor. The court's jurisdictional analysis must consider both diversity jurisdiction and supplemental jurisdiction.

1. **Diversity Jurisdiction**:  
   - The distributor is incorporated in State B and has its principal place of business in State C, making it a citizen of both States B and C.  
   - The wholesaler is incorporated in State B and has its principal place of business in State A, making it a citizen of both States B and A.  
   - Since both the distributor and the wholesaler share citizenship in State B, there is no diversity of citizenship between them. Therefore, diversity jurisdiction does not apply to the counterclaim.

2. **Supplemental Jurisdiction**:  
   - The main case is based on diversity jurisdiction, as the shop owner (State A) and the distributor (States B and C) are diverse, and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.  
   - The wholesaler's counterclaim arises from the same transaction or occurrence as the main claim (the supply of goods and payment disputes). Under 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a), the court has the authority to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over claims that are part of the same case or controversy.  
   - The counterclaim is compulsory because it arises from the same transaction as the distributor's third-party claim for indemnification. Therefore, the court must exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the counterclaim, regardless of the amount in controversy.

3. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option I** correctly states that the motion to dismiss should not be granted because the court has supplemental jurisdiction over the wholesaler's counterclaim.  
   - Other options, such as **Option B**, incorrectly conclude that the lack of diversity jurisdiction alone is sufficient to dismiss the counterclaim, ignoring the applicability of supplemental jurisdiction.

Thus, the motion to dismiss should not be granted because the court has supplemental jurisdiction over the wholesaler's counterclaim.

**Answer: I**
