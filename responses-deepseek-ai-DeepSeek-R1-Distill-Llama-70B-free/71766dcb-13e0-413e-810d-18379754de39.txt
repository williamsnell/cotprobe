Okay, so I've got this algebra problem here, and I need to figure out how to solve it. The question is about converting a quadratic equation from standard form to vertex form. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem says: If we express \(3x^2 + x - 4\) in the form \(a(x - h)^2 + k\), then what is \(k\)? The options are given from A to J.

Hmm, right, I remember that the vertex form of a quadratic equation is \(a(x - h)^2 + k\), where \((h, k)\) is the vertex of the parabola. So, the question is asking for the value of \(k\) when the standard form \(3x^2 + x - 4\) is rewritten in vertex form.

I think the process to convert from standard form to vertex form is called "completing the square." Yeah, that's right. I've heard about completing the square before, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact steps, so I'll try to work through it.

Let me write down the equation again: \(3x^2 + x - 4\). The standard form is \(ax^2 + bx + c\), so here \(a = 3\), \(b = 1\), and \(c = -4\).

The vertex form is \(a(x - h)^2 + k\). So, I need to manipulate \(3x^2 + x - 4\) into that form.

First, I think I should factor out the coefficient of \(x^2\) from the first two terms. That would be 3 in this case. So, let's do that:

\(3(x^2 + \frac{1}{3}x) - 4\).

Wait, because 3 is factored out from \(3x^2\), so \(x^2\) becomes just \(x^2\), and the \(x\) term is divided by 3. So, yes, that step looks right.

Now, inside the parentheses, I have \(x^2 + \frac{1}{3}x\). To complete the square, I need to take half of the coefficient of \(x\), which is \(\frac{1}{3}\), so half of that is \(\frac{1}{6}\), and then square it, which gives \(\frac{1}{36}\).

So I need to add and subtract this square inside the parentheses to maintain equality. Let me write that:

\(3\left( x^2 + \frac{1}{3}x + \frac{1}{36} - \frac{1}{36} \right) - 4\).

Hmm, but wait. Since I'm adding \(\frac{1}{36}\) inside the parentheses, and the 3 is factored out, it's actually adding \(3 * \frac{1}{36}\), which is \(\frac{1}{12}\). But I can't just add that without subtracting it elsewhere to keep the equation balanced.

Wait, no, because I'm adding and subtracting inside the parentheses, the net change is zero. So, the expression becomes:

\(3\left( \left(x^2 + \frac{1}{3}x + \frac{1}{36}\right) - \frac{1}{36} \right) - 4\).

Which can be rewritten as:

\(3\left( \left(x + \frac{1}{6}\right)^2 - \frac{1}{36} \right) - 4\).

Wait, because \(x^2 + \frac{1}{3}x + \frac{1}{36}\) is a perfect square trinomial, right? Let me check that. The square of \(x + \frac{1}{6}\) is \(x^2 + \frac{1}{3}x + \frac{1}{36}\), so yes, that's correct.

So expanding that, I now have:

\(3\left( \left(x + \frac{1}{6}\right)^2 - \frac{1}{36} \right) - 4\).

Next, distribute the 3 into the terms inside the parentheses:

\(3\left(x + \frac{1}{6}\right)^2 - 3 * \frac{1}{36} - 4\).

Calculating \(3 * \frac{1}{36}\), that's \(\frac{3}{36} = \frac{1}{12}\). So the equation becomes:

\(3\left(x + \frac{1}{6}\right)^2 - \frac{1}{12} - 4\).

Now, combine the constant terms: \(-\frac{1}{12} - 4\). Hmm, 4 is the same as \(\frac{48}{12}\), so \(-\frac{1}{12} - \frac{48}{12} = -\frac{49}{12}\).

So putting it all together, the equation in vertex form is:

\(3\left(x + \frac{1}{6}\right)^2 - \frac{49}{12}\).

Wait, but the question asks for the form \(a(x - h)^2 + k\). In my expression, it's \(x + \frac{1}{6}\), which is \(x - (-\frac{1}{6})\). So, the vertex form is \(3(x - (-\frac{1}{6}))^2 + (-\frac{49}{12})\).

Therefore, \(k\) is \(-\frac{49}{12}\).

Looking back at the options, option E is \(-\frac{49}{12}\), so I think that's the correct answer.

Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Factoring out the 3 correctly, completing the square by adding and subtracting \(\frac{1}{36}\), distributing the 3, and combining the constants. Everything seems to add up, so I'm confident that \(k = -\frac{49}{12}\).

To convert the quadratic equation \(3x^2 + x - 4\) into vertex form \(a(x - h)^2 + k\), we use the method of completing the square.

1. Start with the given equation:
   \[
   3x^2 + x - 4
   \]

2. Factor out the coefficient of \(x^2\) (which is 3) from the first two terms:
   \[
   3\left(x^2 + \frac{1}{3}x\right) - 4
   \]

3. Complete the square inside the parentheses. The coefficient of \(x\) is \(\frac{1}{3}\), so take half of this value (\(\frac{1}{6}\)) and square it (\(\frac{1}{36}\)). Add and subtract \(\frac{1}{36}\) inside the parentheses:
   \[
   3\left(x^2 + \frac{1}{3}x + \frac{1}{36} - \frac{1}{36}\right) - 4
   \]

4. Rewrite the perfect square trinomial and simplify:
   \[
   3\left(\left(x + \frac{1}{6}\right)^2 - \frac{1}{36}\right) - 4
   \]

5. Distribute the 3 and combine the constant terms:
   \[
   3\left(x + \frac{1}{6}\right)^2 - \frac{1}{12} - 4
   \]
   \[
   3\left(x + \frac{1}{6}\right)^2 - \frac{49}{12}
   \]

6. The equation is now in vertex form:
   \[
   3\left(x - \left(-\frac{1}{6}\right)\right)^2 + \left(-\frac{49}{12}\right)
   \]

From this, the value of \(k\) is \(-\frac{49}{12}\).

The correct answer is **E: -\frac{49}{12}**.
