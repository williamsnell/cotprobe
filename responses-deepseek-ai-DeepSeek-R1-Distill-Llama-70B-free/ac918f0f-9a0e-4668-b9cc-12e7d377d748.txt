Question:

A developer wished to build an apartment house in a local city. He raised $1 million from various sources to fund the project. After searching for a vacant lot that would be sufficient for development, the developer concluded that there was not a suitable vacant lot available. Reluctantly, the developer concluded that he would have to purchase a developed lot, have the existing structures removed, and then build the apartment house. The developer was reluctant to do this, because he had not budgeted for the additional cost of buying a developed property and removing the development. After a search for an appropriate parcel, the developer purchased a large lot, developed with a single-story residential home, for $200,000. He then spent $50,000 having the residential home removed from the lot. Knowing that it would cost approximately $850,000 to build the apartment house, the developer realized he would need to raise another $100,000. He approached an investor about lending him $100,000. The investor was apprehensive about the project because the developer had not yet lined up a construction firm to build the apartment house. As a result, the parties signed the following written agreement:"The investor promises to lend to the developer $100,000 at 5 percent interest within 30 days, provided the developer contracts with a construction company to build the apartment house for no more than $850,000. Loan to be repaid at the rate of $1,000 per month, starting one month after the completion of the apartment house. The loan is to be secured by a mortgage on the property. "The developer then contracted with a construction company to build the apartment for $800,000. After the contract was signed and construction had begun, the developer asked the investor when he would be receiving the $100,000 the investor promised to lend him. The investor replied, "I've changed my mind. I think this is too risky an investment. I'm not going to lend you the money. "In an appropriate action to secure specific performance of the investor's promise to lend him the $100,000, the developer will

Options:

A: win, because there is a memorandum that satisfies the Statute of Frauds.
B: win, because land is unique, making the legal remedy inadequate.
C: lose, because the developer's only remedy is for damages.
D: lose, because the developer cannot show detrimental reliance.

Okay, so I have this question about contract law, specifically dealing with the Statute of Frauds and specific performance. Let me try to break it down step by step.

So the scenario is that a developer wants to build an apartment house. He raised $1 million initially but couldn't find a vacant lot, so he bought a developed lot for $200k, spent another $50k to remove the existing structure. Now, the apartment will cost $850k, so he needs another $100k and approaches an investor.

The investor agrees to lend $100k at 5% interest within 30 days, but only if the developer contracts with a construction company for no more than $850k. The loan is secured by a mortgage on the property.

Then the developer contracts a company for $800k, which is under the $850k limit. Construction starts, and then the developer asks the investor for the money, but the investor backs out.

The question is about whether the developer can get specific performance of the loan promise. The options are A to D.

First, I need to recall the requirements for specific performance. Specific performance is an equitable remedy usually granted when monetary damages are inadequate, like when the subject matter is uniqueâ€”such as land. But here, the issue is a loan, which is about money. However, the loan is secured by a mortgage on the property, which might make it a bit different.

Wait, but the agreement is for a loan, not a sale of land. So the Statute of Frauds comes into play. The Statute of Frauds requires certain contracts to be in writing to be enforceable. One of those is a promise to lend money, but I think it's more about suretyship or promises to answer for the debt of another. Alternatively, the Statute of Frauds applies to contracts involving land, but here the loan is secured by a mortgage, which is an interest in land.

Wait, the agreement here is a promise to lend money, secured by a mortgage. So is this agreement covered by the Statute of Frauds?

I think the Statute of Frauds requires that certain agreements be in writing. Specifically, under the Statute, contracts that cannot be performed within one year, contracts involving land, and suretyship contracts (promises to pay the debt of another) must be in writing. 

In this case, the investor's promise is to lend money, which is a suretyship? Or is it a direct loan. Hmm. The investor is lending directly to the developer, not paying the debt of another. So maybe it's not a suretyship. So that part of the Statute might not apply.

But the agreement is secured by a mortgage on the property. Does that bring it under the Statute of Frauds? Because a mortgage is an interest in land. So any contract that involves an interest in land must be in writing. So the loan agreement here is secured by a mortgage, which is an interest in land. So the agreement to lend, which is tied to the mortgage, might fall under the Statute of Frauds.

Wait, but the Statute of Frauds applies to contracts that transfer an interest in land. So if the contract involves an interest in land, it needs to be in writing. Here, the loan is secured by a mortgage, which is an interest in land. So is the loan agreement part of a contract that involves land, thus needing a writing?

Alternatively, the promise to lend money is separate from the mortgage. But in this case, the agreement includes the mortgage as security. So the written agreement includes both the promise to lend and the mortgage.

Wait, the question says that the parties signed a written agreement. So the agreement is in writing. So the Statute of Frauds is satisfied because it's written. So option A says that the developer will win because the memorandum satisfies the Statute of Frauds.

But then, the next issue is specific performance. Normally, specific performance is awarded when the legal remedy (damages) is inadequate. For example, in land sales, because each piece of land is unique, specific performance is often granted. But in this case, it's a loan of money. Money is considered a fungible commodity, so usually, damages (the amount lent with interest) would be adequate.

But the loan is secured by a mortgage. Does that change things? Because the developer might argue that the mortgage is unique, or that the loan is tied to the specific property, making it not just about money but about the property's interest.

Wait, but the investor is refusing to make the loan, which is about money, not transferring the property. So the developer could, in theory, get another loan from someone else, and the damages would be the difference in interest rates or any losses incurred.

But in this case, the developer might not be able to get another loan on the same terms. But that's a damages issue. The question is whether specific performance is available.

So, specific performance is more about when the thing promised is unique. Money isn't unique, unless it's tied to something unique. But the loan is secured by the mortgage, which is an interest in the land. So maybe the court would see the loan as part of a larger agreement involving the property, thus making the remedy of specific performance applicable.

Alternatively, the loan is a personal promise, and the security interest is just a collateral agreement. So the main obligation is to pay money, which is fungible.

I think in most cases, specific performance isn't granted for money loans because money is not unique. However, if the loan is part of a larger transaction involving land, maybe the court would consider specific performance.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let's look at the options.

Option A: Win, because there's a memorandum satisfying the Statute of Frauds. So that would address the writing requirement. Since the agreement is in writing, that's satisfied.

Option B: Win, because land is unique, making legal remedy inadequate. But the issue is the loan, not the land itself. Unless the loan is necessary to secure the land's development, but the developer already owns the land, having bought it for $200k. So maybe the uniqueness of the land isn't directly the issue here.

Option C: Lose, because the only remedy is damages. That would be if specific performance isn't available because money is fungible.

Option D: Lose, because no detrimental reliance. But that's more about promissory estoppel, not specific performance. The question is about an action for specific performance, which is a contract remedy, not based on reliance.

So, the developer is suing for specific performance, which requires that the contract is enforceable and that the remedy at law (damages) is inadequate.

The agreement is in writing, so the Statute of Frauds is satisfied (so A could be a reason, but the main issue is specific performance).

Since the promise is to lend money, which is fungible, specific performance is usually not granted because damages are adequate. So the developer would not get specific performance and would have to settle for damages.

But wait, in this case, the loan is secured by a mortgage. So the investor's promise isn't just to lend money; it's to have a secured interest in the property. So maybe the developer can argue that without the loan, he can't proceed, and the specific performance is necessary to get the funds, which are tied to the property's development. But I'm not sure if that makes the money unique.

Alternatively, the loan is a necessary part of the project, but that doesn't make the money unique. The court would probably say that the developer can borrow from another source and recover the difference as damages.

So the correct answer would be C or D.

Wait, D says lose because no detrimental reliance. But that's for promissory estoppel, not specific performance. The question is about specific performance based on contract, not reliance.

So the main issue is whether specific performance is available for a loan of money. Since money is fungible, specific performance is not usually available, so the developer can't get it and must seek damages. So the answer would be option C.

But wait, the agreement is for a loan with specific terms, including a mortgage on specific property. So perhaps the court would see this as a unique arrangement, especially since the developer has already begun construction. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the fact that the developer has a contract with the construction company for less than the stipulated amount might affect this. The agreement required the developer to contract for no more than $850k, and he did it for $800k. So the condition was met.

So the investor's promise was conditioned on that, which was satisfied. Therefore, the investor is in breach.

But the question is about the remedy. So even if the contract is valid and the condition is met, specific performance may not be available because it's a loan of money.

So the developer would lose the specific performance claim and have to seek damages, making option C the correct answer.

Wait, but option B says he wins because land is unique. But the loan isn't about the land itself, it's about funding the construction. So maybe that's not the case.

I think I'm going to go with option C: lose, because the developer's only remedy is for damages.

The question revolves around whether a developer can secure specific performance of an investor's promise to lend $100,000, which is part of a larger project to build an apartment house. The agreement is in writing and includes conditions, such as the developer contracting with a construction company for no more than $850,000, which was satisfied when the developer secured a contract for $800,000. The investor later backed out, prompting the developer to seek specific performance.

Key considerations include the Statute of Frauds and the availability of specific performance. The Statute of Frauds requires certain agreements to be in writing, and this agreement satisfies that requirement as it is written and involves a mortgage on the property. However, the main issue is whether specific performance is an appropriate remedy.

Specific performance is typically granted when monetary damages are inadequate, often in cases involving unique goods or property. While the loan is secured by a mortgage on the property, the promise at issue is to lend money, which is fungible. Courts generally hold that damages are an adequate remedy for breaches involving monetary loans, as money is not unique. The uniqueness of the property or the project does not change the fact that the obligation is to lend funds, which can be obtained from other sources. Therefore, specific performance is unlikely to be granted.

Option A is incorrect because while the agreement satisfies the Statute of Frauds, this does not directly resolve whether specific performance is available. Option B is incorrect because the uniqueness of land does not make the legal remedy inadequate in this context, as the issue is the loan, not the land itself. Option D is incorrect because detrimental reliance is not the standard for specific performance in this case. The correct answer is Option C: the developer will lose because damages are an adequate remedy for the breach.
