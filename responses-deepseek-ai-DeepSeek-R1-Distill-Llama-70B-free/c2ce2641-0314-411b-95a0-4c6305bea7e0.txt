Okay, so I've got this physics question here about spring scales and motion detectors. Hmm, let's see what it says. The question is about a graph where the net force is on the vertical axis and acceleration is on the horizontal. They're asking what quantity is directly measured using the slope of this graph.

Wait, I remember from my classes that when you plot force against acceleration, the slope relates to mass. Oh right, Newton's second law: F equals m times a. So F = ma. If I rearrange this, m would be F over a. So on a graph of F vs a, the slope would be m. But wait, the axes here are reversed. The question says net force is vertical, which is the y-axis, and acceleration is horizontal, the x-axis. So the graph is F on y and a on x.

In that case, if I plot y = m * x, then the slope of y vs x is m. So the slope is mass. But wait, mass is a property of an object. So the question is, which of these options relates to mass.

Looking at the options, option A is inertial mass. Newton's laws are about inertial mass, right? Because F=ma deals with how much an object resists acceleration, which is its inertia. Gravitational mass is about how it responds to gravity, but that's more related to weight.

So the slope of the graph, which is F over a, gives m, the inertial mass. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me double-check. The graph is F (y) vs a (x). So if you have y = m x + 0, the slope is m. So yes, the slope is m, the mass. So the quantity measured is inertial mass, which is option A.

To determine the quantity directly measured using the slope of a graph where the net force is on the vertical axis (y-axis) and acceleration is on the horizontal axis (x-axis), we analyze the relationship between force and acceleration. According to Newton's second law, \( F = ma \), where \( F \) is the net force, \( m \) is the inertial mass, and \( a \) is the acceleration.

Rearranging the equation, \( m = \frac{F}{a} \). On the given graph, the slope of the line is \( \frac{F}{a} \), which corresponds to the inertial mass of the object. Inertial mass represents an object's resistance to changes in its motion, as described by Newton's laws.

Among the options provided, inertial mass (Option A) is the correct answer, as it directly relates to the slope of the graph. Gravitational mass (Option B) pertains to an object's response to gravity, which is unrelated to this specific graph. The other options (kinetic energy, velocity, weight, friction, force, momentum, distance, speed) are not directly measured by the slope of this graph.

Thus, the quantity directly measured using the slope is inertial mass.

Answer: A
