Question:

The registrar’s office at a university has noticed that a large number of students fail to report a change of address. The registrar decides to take a random sample of 150 students from the current directory of students and determine the number of students with the correct addresses on record. He then uses this information to construct a 95 percent confidence interval. Which of the following statements must be true?

Options:

A: The sample proportion of students at this university with the correct address on record is within the confidence interval.
B: Ninety-five percent of the students in the sample have the correct address on record.
C: The confidence interval is accurate for all students, not just the sample.
D: The true proportion of students at this university with the correct address on record is outside the confidence interval 95 percent of the time.
E: The sample proportion of students at this university with the incorrect address on record is within the confidence interval.
F: The true proportion of students at this university with the correct address on record is within the confidence interval constructed.
G: The true proportion of students at this university with the correct addresses on record is within the confidence interval 95 percent of the time.
H: Ninety-five percent of students at this university have the correct address on record.
I: The true proportion of students at this university with incorrect addresses on record is within the confidence interval.
J: The sample size of 150 students is within the confidence interval.

Okay, so I've got this statistics question in front of me, and I'm a bit new to confidence intervals, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The scenario is about a registrar's office at a university. They noticed that a lot of students aren't updating their addresses. So they take a random sample of 150 students from the current directory to see how many have correct addresses. Then they use this info to build a 95% confidence interval. The question is asking which of the statements must be true.

Hmm, I remember that a confidence interval gives a range of values within which the true population parameter is expected to lie, with a certain level of confidence. In this case, 95%. So, for a 95% confidence interval, we're saying that if we were to take many samples and construct an interval each time, 95% of those intervals would contain the true proportion.

Wait, but the options are about what must be true based on this. Let's look at each option one by one.

Option A: The sample proportion is within the confidence interval. Hmm, wait. The confidence interval is calculated based on the sample proportion. So the sample proportion is the point estimate, and the interval is around it. So the sample proportion would definitely be inside the interval, right? Because the interval is centered around it. So A seems true. But wait, is that always the case? Like, if the sample proportion is p_hat, then the interval is p_hat ± margin of error. So yes, p_hat is in the interval. So A would be correct. But wait, let me not jump to conclusions yet. I'll check all options.

Option B: 95% of the students in the sample have correct addresses. No, that's not necessarily true. The 95% is about the confidence level, not the proportion in the sample. So B is probably false.

Option C: The confidence interval is accurate for all students, not just the sample. Hmm. Wait, a confidence interval is about the population parameter, not the sample. So the interval is an estimate for the true proportion in the entire population (all students at the university), not just the sample. So C says it's accurate for all students, meaning the population, which is correct. But wait, 'accurate' might be a tricky word here. Because the interval is an estimate, not exact. So is C correct? Or does it imply that the interval is exactly correct, which it's not. So maybe C is incorrect because 'accurate' might be misunderstood as exact, whereas the interval is a range with a probability of containing the true value.

Option D: The true proportion is outside the interval 95% of the time. No, that's the opposite of what a confidence interval means. Actually, the true proportion is inside 95% of the time, over many samples. So D is incorrect.

Option E: The sample proportion of students with incorrect addresses is within the interval. Wait, the confidence interval is about the correct addresses, right? Because the registrar is checking correct addresses. So the sample proportion for incorrect would be 1 minus the correct. But the confidence interval is built for the correct proportion. So E might not make sense. Also, the sample proportion (correct) is inside the interval, but the incorrect would be another value, perhaps outside. So E is probably incorrect.

Option F: The true proportion is within the constructed interval. Hmm, but the confidence interval is probabilistic. It doesn't mean that the true proportion is definitely inside this particular interval. It means that 95% of such intervals would contain the true proportion. So F says it's within this interval, which is a single instance. So F is not necessarily true. Because we could have one of the 5% intervals that don't include the true proportion. So F is not a must-be-true statement.

Option G: The true proportion is within the interval 95% of the time. Oh, this aligns with what I remember. The confidence level is the probability that the true parameter lies within the interval, assuming many samples. So G says that 95% of the time, the true proportion is inside the interval, which is correct. So G is a true statement.

Option H: 95% of students have correct addresses. No, that's assuming the sample proportion is 95%, but the question doesn't say that. The 95% refers to the confidence level, not the proportion in the sample. So H is incorrect.

Option I: The true proportion of incorrect addresses is within the interval. Wait, the interval is about correct addresses, not incorrect. Unless the question's interval is two-tailed, but no, the problem is about correct addresses, so the interval pertains to correct, not incorrect. So I is incorrect.

Option J: The sample size is within the interval. No, sample size is 150, which is a count. The confidence interval is a proportion (or perhaps a percentage), so 150 can't be in a proportion interval. So J is incorrect.

Now, going back to the options. So which options are correct?

A: Sample proportion is within the interval. That's true because the interval is built around the sample proportion. So yes, A is correct.

G: True proportion is within the interval 95% of the time. Also correct.

Wait, but the question is which statements 'must be true'. So I need to check if both A and G are correct, but looking back, perhaps the options are mutually exclusive.

Wait, in the options given, both A and G seem correct. But let's think again.

Wait, the sample proportion is the point estimate, so the confidence interval is constructed around it. So the sample proportion is definitely inside the interval. So A is correct.

G is also correct because that's the definition of a 95% confidence interval: 95% of such intervals would include the true proportion.

Wait, but the way the options are phrased. Let me read them carefully.

Option A says "The sample proportion... is within the confidence interval." That's correct, because the interval is centered on the sample proportion. So yes, A is correct.

Option G says "The true proportion... is within the confidence interval 95% of the time." That's correct because that's the definition of a 95% confidence interval.

Wait, but the options are multiple choice, and only one can be correct. Wait, looking back at the options, perhaps I'm mistaken. Wait, the question says "which of the following statements must be true." So possibly more than one could be correct, but the options are single choice. Or perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, the options given are A-J, but each is a separate statement. So perhaps both A and G are correct, but looking at the options again, let me check.

Wait, the question says "which of the following statements must be true." So perhaps only one is correct. Let me think again.

Wait, no, the correct statements are A and G. But in the given options, each is a separate choice. So perhaps both could be correct, but the options only allow to choose one.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, the confidence interval is based on the sample proportion. So the sample proportion is the center of the interval, so yes, it's within the interval. So A is correct.

But G is also correct in stating that the true proportion is within the interval 95% of the time, which is the definition of a 95% confidence interval.

Wait, but can both A and G be correct? Because A is about the sample proportion being inside the interval for this particular sample, which is always true.

G is about the true proportion being inside the interval over many samples, which is the probabilistic interpretation.

So in this case, both A and G are correct. But looking at the options, perhaps the intended correct answer is G, because A is about the sample proportion in the interval, which is trivially true, but the more important point is about the true proportion.

Wait, but the question is which statement must be true. So both A and G are correct, but perhaps the options don't have both as choices. Let me look again: the options are A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J.

So perhaps the intended answer is G, but I thought A was correct.

Wait, but the sample proportion is definitely in the confidence interval, because the interval is calculated as p_hat ± margin of error. So p_hat is the center, so it's within the interval. So A must be true.

G is also true because that's the definition of a confidence interval. So both A and G are correct statements. Wait, but in the options, only one can be selected. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is a bit different. Let me re-read the question to make sure.

The question says the registrar uses the sample information to construct a 95% confidence interval. So he's built the interval.

Which statements must be true.

So, A is about the sample proportion being in the interval, which is always true. G is about the true proportion being in the interval 95% of the time, which is the definition of a confidence interval.

So both A and G must be true. But looking at the options, perhaps the intended answer is G, but I'm a bit confused because the options are presented as A to J, and each is a separate option.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is G. Because A is correct as well, but perhaps the question is testing understanding of confidence intervals, which is more about G.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The confidence interval is constructed around the sample proportion. So the sample proportion is definitely inside the interval. So A is correct.

But in the options, both A and G could be correct. But perhaps the correct answer is A and G. But since the options are individual, perhaps the intended correct answer is both A and G are correct. But in the given options, only one can be chosen.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is A and G, but I have to choose from the options. Let me check the options again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me look at the options again:

Option A: Sample proportion is within the interval. Correct.

Option G: True proportion is within the interval 95% of the time. Correct.

But the question is asking which must be true. So both A and G are correct, but perhaps the options don't allow multiple selections. In the question, it's a single choice, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options. Let me read them again.

Option F: The true proportion is within the constructed interval.

Wait, no, because for a single interval, we don't know if it contains the true proportion. The confidence level is about repeated sampling. So F is not necessarily true. So F is incorrect.

Option G says the true proportion is within the interval 95% of the time, which is correct.

So in this case, both A and G are correct. Wait, but the way the options are presented, perhaps the intended answer is G, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is A and G, but the options don't allow that. So maybe the question expects only one correct answer. Let me check what each option says.

Wait, the question is a multiple-choice with options A to J, each being a separate statement. So I have to pick the correct one(s) that must be true.

So, A is correct because the sample proportion is the center of the interval, so it's within. G is correct because that's the definition of confidence intervals.

But perhaps the intended answer is G, as it's the more critical point about confidence intervals, whereas A is more of a given.

Wait, but both are correct. However, maybe the answer expects only one correct option, and in that case, perhaps I should choose both A and G, but in reality, since it's a single choice, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: the question asks which statement must be true.

So, for A: yes, the sample proportion is within the interval.

For G: yes, the true proportion is within the interval 95% of the time.

So both are correct statements. However, looking at the options, perhaps the intended answer is G, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A and G, but since the options are individual, perhaps the intended answer is G. Because A is more about the calculation, which is correct, but perhaps the question is more about the interpretation of confidence intervals.

Wait, but looking back, perhaps the correct answer is G. Because G is talking about the true proportion, which is what the confidence interval is about.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A and G, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the options again.

Looking back:

Option F says the true proportion is within the constructed interval. That's not necessarily true because it's possible that the true proportion is outside this particular interval. So F is not a must-be-true statement.

Option G says the true proportion is within the interval 95% of the time, which is correct.

So, I think both A and G are correct. But the options don't allow selecting multiple, so perhaps the intended answer is G.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is G.

But earlier I thought A is correct as well. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A and G, but since that's not possible, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the sample proportion is at the center, so it's definitely in the interval, making A correct.

G is also correct because that's the definition.

But perhaps the question is designed so that only G is correct, and A is a trick option.

Wait, no, because A is definitely correct. So perhaps both A and G are correct, but the way the options are presented, perhaps the intended answer is G.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of it another way.

The confidence interval is calculated based on the sample proportion. So the sample proportion is always in the interval. So A must be true.

G is also correct, as that's the purpose of a confidence interval.

So both A and G are correct statements. But the options don't allow for multiple selections, so perhaps the intended answer is G.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is G.

But no, I think both A and G are correct. Wait, but the options are mutually exclusive, so perhaps I made a mistake in considering A.

Wait, perhaps the confidence interval is for the population proportion, which is a parameter, so the sample proportion is a statistic. So the sample proportion is a single value, and the confidence interval is around that value, so A is correct.

But in the options, only one can be chosen. So perhaps the correct answer is A.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me try to recall: when you construct a confidence interval, the sample proportion is the midpoint, so it's definitely inside the interval. So A is correct.

G is also correct because that's the definition of confidence intervals.

But the question is which must be true, and both A and G are correct. However, since each option is separate, perhaps the intended answer is G.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is both A and G, but that's not an option. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is G.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A and G, but in the absence of that option, perhaps the intended answer is G.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is A and G. But perhaps the intended answer is only G.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is G, and A is a trick.

Wait, perhaps the sample proportion is indeed in the interval, making A correct. So I'm more confident that A is correct.

But then, why is G also correct?

Wait, perhaps I should look for the correct answer as per standard teaching.

In standard terms, the confidence interval is constructed around the sample proportion, so A is correct.

G is correct because that's the definition of a confidence interval.

So both A and G are correct. But since the options are separate, perhaps the intended answer is G.

Wait, but perhaps the question is testing a specific point. Let me think: the sample proportion is within the interval. So A is correct.

G is correct as well.

But the question is which must be true. So perhaps both A and G are correct, but the options only allow one choice.

Wait, perhaps the intended answer is G. Because A seems too obvious, but perhaps the question is more about the interpretation of the confidence interval regarding the population parameter.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is both A and G, but since that's not possible, perhaps the intended answer is G.

Wait, I'm getting stuck, but I think the correct answer is G, because that's the key point about confidence intervals, but A is also correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is A and G. But since the options don't allow that, perhaps the intended answer is G.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A and G, but in the given options, perhaps the intended answer is G.

Hmm. I'm a bit confused, but perhaps I'll go with G as the correct answer.

The question involves a registrar’s office constructing a 95% confidence interval to estimate the proportion of students with correct addresses. The task is to determine which statement must be true based on the properties of confidence intervals.

### Analysis of Options:
1. **Option A**: "The sample proportion of students at this university with the correct address on record is within the confidence interval."  
   - This is true because the confidence interval is constructed around the sample proportion. The sample proportion is the point estimate, and the interval is centered on it, so the sample proportion must lie within the interval.

2. **Option B**: "Ninety-five percent of the students in the sample have the correct address on record."  
   - This is false. The 95% refers to the confidence level, not the proportion of students in the sample.

3. **Option C**: "The confidence interval is accurate for all students, not just the sample."  
   - This is false. The confidence interval is an estimate for the population parameter (true proportion) and is not exact. It is not "accurate" in the sense of being precisely correct.

4. **Option D**: "The true proportion of students at this university with the correct address on record is outside the confidence interval 95 percent of the time."  
   - This is false. A 95% confidence interval means the true proportion is inside the interval 95% of the time, not outside.

5. **Option E**: "The sample proportion of students at this university with the incorrect address on record is within the confidence interval."  
   - This is false. The confidence interval is constructed for the proportion of students with correct addresses, not incorrect addresses.

6. **Option F**: "The true proportion of students at this university with the correct address on record is within the confidence interval constructed."  
   - This is false. While the confidence interval is designed to contain the true proportion, it is not guaranteed to do so for a single interval. It is probabilistic over many samples.

7. **Option G**: "The true proportion of students at this university with the correct addresses on record is
