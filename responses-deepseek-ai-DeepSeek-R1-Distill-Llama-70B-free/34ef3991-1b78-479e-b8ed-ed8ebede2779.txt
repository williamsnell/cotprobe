Question:

On a pipe, heat transfer is accomplished through a straight fin extending into an air stream. The fin may be idealized as a flat square plate with a 5.1 cm side. The flow is measured at 12.2m/s, and is at a temperature and pressure of 15.6°C and 1atmabs., respectively. If the plate surface temperature is 82.2°C, calculate the heat transfer coefficient assuming (a) laminar flow, and (b) a rough leading edge, making the adjacent boundary layer completely turbulent.

Options:

A: 60.67 W/m -°K for laminar flow, 77.18 W/m^2-°K for turbulent flow
B: 70.67 W/m -°K for laminar flow, 65.18 W/m^2-°K for turbulent flow
C: 50.67 W/m -°K for laminar flow, 85.18 W/m^2-°K for turbulent flow
D: 45.67 W/m -°K for laminar flow, 90.18 W/m^2-°K for turbulent flow

Okay, so I have this problem about heat transfer on a pipe with a straight fin. The fin is a flat square plate, and I need to calculate the heat transfer coefficient under two conditions: laminar flow and turbulent flow due to a rough leading edge. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the heat transfer coefficient (h) for flow over a plate depends on whether the flow is laminar or turbulent. For a flat plate, there are standard correlations used.

The problem gives me the dimensions of the plate—each side is 5.1 cm, so the length (L) is 0.051 meters. The flow velocity is 12.2 m/s. The air conditions are 15.6°C and 1 atm. The surface temperature is 82.2°C, but I think that might not be directly needed here since the question is about calculating h, which depends on the fluid properties and flow conditions.

Wait, but h is for the conditions of the air, right? So I need the properties of air at the film temperature. The film temperature is the average of the surface and the ambient air temperatures. So (82.2 + 15.6)/2 = 97.8/2 = 48.9°C. Wait, no, wait, 82.2 +15.6 is 97.8, divided by 2 is 48.9°C. So I should look up the properties of air at 48.9°C.

Air properties: at around 50°C, the density (rho) is roughly 1.095 kg/m³, the specific heat (cp) is about 1005 J/kg·K, the dynamic viscosity (mu) is around 1.95e-5 kg/m·s, and the thermal conductivity (k) is approximately 0.0278 W/m·K. I'll need these values for the calculations.

The formula for the heat transfer coefficient for a flat plate is typically the Nusselt number (Nu) multiplied by k over the length (L). The Nusselt number is determined by the Reynolds number and the Prandtl number.

For laminar flow (case a), the correlation is Nu = 0.664 * Re^0.5 * Pr^(1/3), assuming Re is less than 500,000. Wait, but wait, the Re for the plate is based on the length. So Re = (velocity * L) / kinematic viscosity. But kinematic viscosity (nu) is mu/rho.

Wait, let me compute Re. Velocity is 12.2 m/s, L is 0.051 m. So Re = (12.2 * 0.051) / (mu/rho). Let me plug in the numbers.

Wait, mu is 1.95e-5 kg/m·s, rho is 1.095 kg/m³. So nu = mu/rho = 1.95e-5 / 1.095 ≈ 1.78e-5 m²/s.

So Re = (12.2 * 0.051) / 1.78e-5. Let me calculate that:

12.2 * 0.051 = 0.6222 m²/s? Wait no, velocity is m/s, L is m, so velocity * L is m²/s. Then divided by nu, which is m²/s, so Re is unitless.

So 0.6222 / 1.78e-5 ≈ let's compute:

0.6222 / 0.0000178. Let's see: 0.6222 / 0.0000178 = 6222 / 17.8 ≈ approximately 349.438. So Re is about 349.44.

Wait, that's way below 500,000, so definitely laminar flow for part (a). So I can use the laminar correlation.

Now, for laminar flow, the average Nu is 0.664 * Re^0.5 * Pr^(1/3). I need to find the Prandtl number (Pr) for air at 48.9°C.

Pr = (mu * cp) / k. Plugging the numbers: mu is 1.95e-5, cp is 1005, and k is 0.0278.

So Pr = (1.95e-5 * 1005) / 0.0278.

Calculating numerator: 1.95e-5 * 1005 = 0.0195995.

Divide by 0.0278: 0.0195995 / 0.0278 ≈ 0.705.

So Pr is approximately 0.705.

Now, back to Nu: 0.664 * (349.44)^0.5 * (0.705)^(1/3).

Compute Re^0.5: sqrt(349.44) ≈ 18.69.

(0.705)^(1/3): Let me think. Cube root of 0.705 is approximately 0.89. Because 0.9³ is 0.729, so 0.89³ would be (0.89)^3: 0.89*0.89=0.7921, *0.89 ≈ 0.705. So yeah, about 0.89.

So Nu = 0.664 * 18.69 * 0.89.

Calculate 0.664 * 18.69: 0.664 * 18 = 11.952, 0.664 * 0.69 ≈ 0.458. So total ≈ 12.41.

Then 12.41 * 0.89 ≈ 11.06.

So Nu ≈ 11.06. Then, h = Nu * k / L.

k is 0.0278 W/m·K, L is 0.051 m.

h = (11.06 * 0.0278) / 0.051.

Calculate numerator: 11.06 * 0.0278 ≈ 0.3072.

Divide by 0.051: 0.3072 / 0.051 ≈ 6.02 W/m²·K.

Wait, that can't be right. Because the options are about 45 to 70. Hmm, I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, Re was 349.44. So sqrt(Re) is about 18.69. That's correct.

Pr^(1/3) is 0.89. Correct.

So 0.664 * 18.69 = let me compute more accurately. 18.69 * 0.664.

18 * 0.664 = 11.952. 0.69 * 0.664 = 0.45876. Sum is 12.41076.

Multiply by 0.89: 12.41076 * 0.89. Let me compute that.

12 * 0.89 = 10.68. 0.41076 * 0.89 ≈ 0.3653. So total is 11.045, say approximately 11.045.

Then h = Nu * k / L. k=0.0278, L=0.051.

11.045 * 0.0278 = let's calculate: 11 * 0.0278=0.3058, 0.045 *0.0278≈0.001251. So total is about 0.307.

Divide by 0.051: 0.307 / 0.051 ≈ 6.0196 W/m²·K.

Wait, that's way lower than any of the options. The options start at 45. So I must have made a mistake in my assumptions.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the formula. Let me think again. Oh wait, for a flat plate, the Nusselt number for laminar flow is 0.664 Re^0.5 Pr^(1/3). But that's for Re based on the length.

Wait, but let me check if I computed Re correctly. Re = (V * L) / nu.

V is 12.2 m/s, L is 0.051 m. nu at 48.9°C is 1.78e-5 m²/s.

Re = (12.2 * 0.051) / 1.78e-5 = 0.6222 / 0.0000178 = let me compute that again.

0.6222 divided by 0.0000178.

Well, 0.6222 / 0.0000178: Let's compute 0.6222 / 1.78e-5 = 6222e-4 / 1.78e-5 = (6222 / 1.78) * 1e-4 +5 → 6222 /1.78 ≈ 3494.38 → so 3494.38 *1e1 → 34943.8? Wait, no, wait, 1e-4 +5 is 1e1. So 3494.38 *10= 34943.8.

Wait, that would make Re ≈ 34943.8, not 349!

Wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation here? Let me redo it.

12.2 m/s * 0.051 m = 0.6222 m²/s.

Divide by nu, which is 1.78e-5 m²/s: 0.6222 / 0.0000178 = ?

Let me compute 0.6222 / 0.0000178.

Let me write it as 0.6222 / 1.78e-5 = (0.6222 / 1.78) * 1e5.

0.6222 / 1.78 ≈ 0.3494.

Multiply by 1e5: 0.3494e5 = 34940 ≈ 34,940.

So Re is approximately 34,940. Oh wait, that's way higher than 500,000? No, 34,940 is less than 500,000. Oh, so I think I made a mistake in the earlier calculation of Re. Because 12.2 m/s is a high velocity, and L is 5.1 cm. So the Re is about 34,940, which is in the turbulent region? Or maybe in the transition?

Wait, for flow over a flat plate, the critical Re is about 500,000. So Re of 34,940 is still laminar. So part (a) is laminar flow.

Wait, but I'm confused because the initial calculation gave me Re of 349, but that was a mistake. It's actually Re ≈ 34,940.

So I must recalculate with Re = 34,940.

So for part (a), laminar flow: Nu_lam = 0.664 * Re^0.5 * Pr^(1/3).

Re^0.5 = sqrt(34940)= about 186.8.

Pr is 0.705, so Pr^(1/3)= approx 0.89.

So Nu_lam = 0.664 * 186.8 * 0.89 = let me compute:

0.664 * 186.8 = let's compute 186 * 0.664 = 123.6, and 0.8 *0.664=0.5312, so total approximately 124.13.

Multiply by 0.89: 124.13 *0.89 ≈110.4.

So Nu ≈ 110.4.

Then h = Nu * k / L.

k=0.0278 W/m·K, L=0.051 m.

h = (110.4 * 0.0278) / 0.051.

Compute numerator: 110.4 *0.0278 ≈ 3.0683.

Divide by 0.051: 3.0683 / 0.051 ≈ 60.15 W/m²·K.

Hmm, that's around 60. So looking at the options, option A has 60.67 for laminar, option D has 45.67. So perhaps option A is part (a).

Now, part (b): turbulent flow because of a rough leading edge. So I should use the turbulent flow correlation.

The standard turbulent correlation for a flat plate is Nu = 0.037 * Re^0.8 * Pr^(1/3), but that's for Re up to 10^7 or so, and Pr between 0.6 and 10.

But wait, there's another correlation sometimes used for turbulent flow: Nu = 0.037 Re^0.8 Pr^(1/3), and sometimes a corrected version for higher accuracy.

So Re is 34,940, which is in the turbulent regime? Wait, no, Re is 34,940 which is less than 500,000. Oh wait, but the problem says that the leading edge is rough, making the boundary layer turbulent. So it's turbulent flow despite Re being in the laminar range.

So for turbulent flow, I should use the appropriate correlation. Let me think—another correlation for turbulent flow is Nu = 0.037 Re^0.8 Pr^(1/3).

Alternatively, since Re is 34,940, perhaps it's better to use the correlation applicable for Re starting from 5e5 to 5e8: but wait, 34,940 is way below that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should use the correlation for transition or for a rough surface. Alternatively, maybe the average Nusselt number is given by another formula when the flow is forced to be turbulent from the leading edge.

Wait, another approach: the general formula for turbulent flow is Nu = (0.037 Re^0.8 - 540) Pr^(1/3), but that's when Re is between 1e5 and 1e6.

Wait, no, maybe that's not correct. Alternatively, perhaps for lower Re in turbulent flow, the correlation is Nu = 0.030 Re^0.8 Pr^(1/3). Or maybe the same 0.037 factor applies.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed with the standard turbulent correlation, assuming that the rough leading edge causes the flow to be turbulent, so the applicable formula is Nu = 0.037 Re^0.8 Pr^(1/3).

So let's compute that.

Re is 34,940. So Re^0.8: let me compute that.

34,940^0.8: Let's approximate. Let me think in terms of exponents. Let me take natural logs.

ln(34940) = about ln(3e4) ≈ 10.3 (since ln(1e4)=9.21, ln(3e4)= ln(3)+9.21≈1.1+9.21=10.31). So 0.8 * ln(Re) = 0.8 *10.31≈8.248. So e^8.248 ≈ e^8 is about 2980, e^0.248≈1.28, so 2980 *1.28≈3816. So Re^0.8 ≈ 3816.

Then, Nu = 0.037 * 3816 * 0.89 (since Pr^(1/3) is 0.89).

Compute 0.037 * 3816 = approximately 141.192.

Multiply by 0.89: 141.192 * 0.89 ≈ 125.65.

So Nu ≈ 125.65.

Then h = Nu * k / L.

k=0.0278, L=0.051.

h = (125.65 * 0.0278) / 0.051.

Compute numerator: 125.65 * 0.0278 ≈ 3.492.

Divide by 0.051: 3.492 / 0.051 ≈ 68.47 W/m²·K.

Hmm, but the options for part (b) are higher. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A: (a) 60.67, (b)77.18.

Option D: (a)45.67, (b)90.18.

Wait, my calculation for (a) was ~60.15, which aligns with option A's (a) 60.67.

For (b), my calculation is ~68.47, but none of the options have exactly that. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation, perhaps using the wrong correlation.

Wait, perhaps for turbulent flow, the formula is different. Another formula I recall is Nu = 0.037 Re^0.8 Pr^(1/3), which I used. But another possibility is that for a rough surface, the Nusselt number increases, perhaps using a different correlation.

Alternatively, perhaps the flow is fully turbulent, so the correlation is Nu = 0.037*(Re^0.8 - 920)*Pr^(1/3). Wait, but I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the Reynolds number correctly, but perhaps I made a mistake in the Re calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate Re with precise numbers.

V = 12.2 m/s, L=0.051 m.

nu = mu / rho = 1.95e-5 kg/m·s / 1.095 kg/m³ = 1.95e-5 / 1.095 = 1.78e-5 m²/s (as before).

Re = (V * L) / nu = (12.2 * 0.051) / 1.78e-5.

12.2 * 0.051 = 0.6222.

0.6222 / 1.78e-5 = 0.6222 / 0.0000178 = let me compute this precisely.

Compute 0.6222 / 0.0000178.

Let me write it as 622.2e-3 / 17.8e-6 = (622.2 / 17.8) * (1e-3 / 1e-6) = 35.0 * 1e3 = 35,000.

Wait, wait, 622.2 / 17.8 = let's compute 17.8 * 35 = 622.3. So 35.0.

So Re = 35,000.

Ah, so Re is 35,000. That makes sense, I think I made a mistake earlier in the division.

So Re=35,000.

Now, for laminar flow, part (a): Nu=0.664 * sqrt(Re) * Pr^(1/3).

sqrt(35,000)= 187.08.

Pr^(1/3)=0.89.

So Nu=0.664 * 187.08 * 0.89.

Compute 0.664 *187.08: 0.6 *187=112.2, 0.064 *187≈11.968. So
