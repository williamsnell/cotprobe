Okay, so I have this question about Kohlberg's stages of moral development. I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, but I remember that Kohlberg proposed that people go through different stages when developing morally. The question is about the second stage of the preconventional level. 

Preconventional morality, if I recall correctly, is the first level where children's moral reasoning is based on external factors. The stages are divided into three levels: preconventional, conventional, and postconventional. Each level has two stages.

So the first stage in the preconventional level, I think, is about avoiding punishment. Like, kids do the right thing because they don't want to get in trouble. So they obey rules to stay out of punishment. Then comes the second stage. 

Wait, the question is about the second stage of the preconventional level. So what's that about? Oh right, the second stage is called "Individualism, instrumental exchange." Or something like that. The idea is that children start to see that there are different perspectives, but they're still pretty self-centered. They might follow rules if it's in their own interest or if they get something from it. 

So in this stage, obeying rules is more about personal gain. Like, if they follow a rule, they might get a reward or something they want. Or maybe it's about exchanging favors. Like, "I'll be good if you do something for me." 

Looking at the options:

A: They are taught rules are unbreakable. Hmm, that sounds more like the first stage, where rules are seen as absolute because of authority. 

B: Enjoy following rules. I don't think that's the main reason here. It's more about external rewards than intrinsic enjoyment.

C: Rewarded for following. That fits with the idea of doing something to get a reward, which is personal gain. 

D: Feel a personal duty. That seems more like a higher stage, maybe the conventional level where people follow rules because they feel it's their duty.

E: Helps satisfy personal needs. This sounds similar to stage two, where it's about getting what they want. But I think the key here is the exchange aspect. So maybe both C and E are possible, but C is more about rewards, which might be part of the exchange.

F: Understand fairness and justice. That's probably a later stage, maybe the conventional level where people start considering society's norms.

G: Avoid punishment. That's the first stage, so not the second.

H: Everyone else is doing it. That sounds like peer pressure, maybe the conventional level when people care about others' opinions.

I: Inherent goodness of rules. That might be later stages too, where rules are seen as inherently right.

J: Fear societal disapproval. Also, probably conventional level.

So putting it together, the second stage is about instrumental exchange and personal gain. So the correct answer would be either C or E. The question is, do they obey because they are rewarded (C) or because it helps them satisfy their personal needs (E)?

Wait, in stage two, the reasoning is more about exchanging favors and getting what they want. So maybe it's E. But I'm a bit confused because Kohlberg's stage two is sometimes described as "what's in it for me?" So it's about rewards or getting something in return.

Alternatively, the question is about why they obey. So in stage two, children might follow rules because they see it as a way to get rewards. So option C says "they are rewarded for following rules." That makes sense because it's the instrumental aspect. So the motivation is the reward, which is an external factor.

Alternatively, option E says "doing so helps them satisfy their personal needs." That's also about personal gain, but maybe in a broader sense.

Wait, the first stage is about avoiding punishment, and the second is about getting rewards or benefits. So I think C is correct, because it's the reward aspect. But I'm not entirely sure because I might be mixing up the nuances.

Another approach: looking at the stages. Stage one is obedience and punishment orientation. Stage two is individualism and exchange. So in stage two, it's about reciprocity and getting benefits. So perhaps the reasoning is "if I do this, I'll get that." So obeying because it benefits them, which would be E.

Wait, but the options are about why they obey. So in stage two, they obey because they are rewarded. Or is it because they see that following rules helps them get what they want, which is their personal needs.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer is C or E. I'm a bit torn.

Wait, another thought. The second stage is about understanding that different people have different perspectives and that actions are motivated by self-interest. So a child might think, "I'll follow the rule if it helps me get something I want," which is more about personal needs (E). Or, "I'll follow because I get a reward," which is C.

I think C is more about receiving a reward, perhaps from an authority figure, whereas E is more about satisfying their own needs through the action itself.

But I'm not entirely sure. I think the correct answer is C, because the second stage is about the exchange of favors and rewards. So they obey because they get something in return, like a reward. So the answer would be C.

During the second stage of Kohlberg’s preconventional level of moral development, children obey rules because they are motivated by personal gain or rewards. This stage, often referred to as "Individualism, instrumental exchange," involves children understanding that rules can be followed if it benefits them or allows them to receive something in return. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: This suggests rules are unbreakable, which aligns more with the first stage, where obedience is based on avoiding punishment.
- **B**: Enjoyment of following rules is not the primary motivator in this stage.
- **C**: Being rewarded for following rules fits well, as it reflects the instrumental aspect of exchanging behavior for rewards.
- **D**: A sense of personal duty is more characteristic of later stages, particularly the conventional level.
- **E**: While satisfying personal needs is related, it is broader and less specific to the reward-based motivation of this stage.
- **F**: Understanding fairness and justice is a hallmark of later stages.
- **G**: Avoiding punishment is the focus of the first stage, not the second.
- **H**: Conforming because "everyone else is doing it" pertains to the conventional level.
- **I**: Believing in the inherent goodness of rules is more relevant to postconventional stages.
- **J**: Fear of societal disapproval is also more aligned with the conventional level.

The most accurate answer is **C**, as it directly captures the idea that children obey rules in this stage because they are rewarded for doing so.

Answer: C
