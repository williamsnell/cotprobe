Okay, so I've got this problem here about Field and Co. buying dolls and selling some of them. I need to find the minimum retail price they should charge for the remaining dolls to get an average markup of 35%. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let's get the basics clear. They bought 100 dolls at $3.25 each. So the total cost for all the dolls would be 100 times 3.25. Let me calculate that: 100 * 3.25 equals $325. So the total cost is $325.

Now, they sold 25 of these dolls for $6 each. So the revenue from those sales is 25 times 6, which is $150. So they've made $150 from selling 25 dolls.

Wait, but we're looking at markup, not just profit. Markup is the amount added to the cost to get the selling price. So the markup percentage is based on the cost, right? So the average markup across all the dolls needs to be 35%.

But wait, average markup is calculated based on the total cost and the total selling price. Oh, right, because markup is cost plus some percentage of the cost. So the formula for average markup percentage would be (Total Selling Price - Total Cost) / Total Cost * 100 equals the markup percentage.

So the goal is to have an average markup of 35% across all 100 dolls. Let me think about that. The total cost is $325, as I already calculated.

Let me denote the selling price of the remaining 75 dolls as S. So the total selling price for all 100 dolls would be the $150 from the first 25 plus 75 times S. So that's 150 + 75S.

The average markup is 35%, so ((Total SP - Total Cost) / Total Cost) = 0.35.

Putting the numbers in: (150 +75S - 325) / 325 = 0.35.

Let me compute the numerator first: 150 +75S -325. That simplifies to 75S -175.

So (75S -175) / 325 = 0.35.

Multiply both sides by 325:

75S -175 = 0.35 * 325.

Calculate 0.35 * 325. Let me see: 325 times 0.3 is 97.5, and 325 times 0.05 is 16.25. So 97.5 +16.25 is 113.75. So 75S -175 = 113.75.

Now, add 175 to both sides: 75S = 113.75 +175 = 288.75.

Divide both sides by 75: S = 288.75 /75.

Let me compute that. 75 times 3 is 225. 288.75 -225 is 63.75. So 3 + (63.75/75). 63.75 divided by 75 is 0.85. So S is $3.85.

Wait, but that's not one of the options. Wait, did I do everything right?

Let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me go through it again.

Total cost is 100 *3.25 = $325. Correct.

They sold 25 dolls at $6 each, so 25*6=150. Correct.

Total selling price needed is 150 +75S.

Markup percentage is 35%, so (Total SP - Total Cost)/Total Cost = 0.35.

So (150 +75S -325) / 325 = 0.35.

Simplifying numerator: 75S -175.

So 75S -175 = 0.35 * 325.

0.35 *325 is 113.75. So 75S = 113.75 +175 = 288.75.

288.75 divided by 75.

Wait, 75 goes into 288.75 how many times? Let me compute 75 *3=225, 75*3.8=285, because 75*0.8 is 60. So 3.8 is 285, leaving 3.75, which is 0.05 of 75. So 3.8 +0.05=3.85. So S is $3.85.

But looking at the options, the closest is option J, which is $3.75. Hmm, but that's lower than 3.85. So none of the options match 3.85. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the average markup. Perhaps the average markup is calculated per item, not overall. So perhaps each item's selling price must have an average markup of 35% over cost.

Wait, but the question says the average retail markup is 35%. So maybe it's across all items.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the total markup needed and then find the required price for the remaining dolls.

Total cost is $325. 35% markup on total cost would be 0.35*325 = $113.75.

So total selling price needs to be Total Cost + Markup = 325 +113.75 = $438.75.

They've already sold 25 dolls for $150, so the remaining 75 must bring in 438.75 -150 = $288.75.

So 75 dolls need to bring $288.75 total. So per doll, that's 288.75 /75 = $3.85.

Wait, same result as before. But none of the options is 3.85. Let me look at the options again.

Options are:

A: $4.38

B: $4.99

C: $7.00

D: $6.75

E: $4.67

F: $6.25

G: $5.00

H: $5.50

I: $5.85

J: $3.75

Hmm, none of these is 3.85. Did I do something wrong?

Wait a second, maybe my initial approach is wrong. Let me think again. Maybe the markup is based on the cost per item, and the average is in terms of per item.

Wait, let's see. The average markup is 35% on cost. So per item, cost is $3.25, so markup per item is 0.35*3.25 = $1.1375. So selling price per item would be 3.25 +1.1375 = $4.3875. So approximately $4.39 per doll. But they sold 25 dolls at $6 each, which is more than that. So maybe the average is across all items, but some are above, some are below.

Wait, but the question says they want the average markup to be 35%. So perhaps the overall markup is 35% on total cost.

Wait, I think I did that correctly earlier, but the result I get isn't among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait another approach: Maybe instead of overall, the average markup per item is 35%. So for each item, the markup is 35% of cost.

So for each doll, markup is 3.25 * 0.35 = $1.1375.

So selling price per doll must be 3.25 +1.1375 = $4.3875. So approximately $4.39. So looking at the options, E is $4.67, which is higher, and option A is $4.38, which is very close.

Wait, but if they sold 25 dolls at $6, which is higher than 4.38, and the remaining need to be at 4.38, then the average markup would be higher than 35% because some items have higher markups. Hmm, but the question is about the minimum price they can charge for the rest to achieve an average of 35%. So perhaps the minimum price is the same as the required average, but I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps my initial approach is correct, but I need to see why the answer isn't among the options. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps.

Wait, let me go back to the first calculation.

Total cost is $325.

They sold 25 at $6: revenue from these is $150.

Let S be the selling price per remaining doll. So total revenue from remaining 75 dolls is 75S.

Total revenue overall is 150 +75S.

Total markup is (150 +75S -325) = 75S -175.

We need (75S -175)/325 = 0.35.

So 75S -175 = 0.35*325 = 113.75.

75S = 113.75 +175 = 288.75.

S= 288.75 /75 = 3.85.

Hmm, same result. So the minimum price per remaining doll is $3.85, but that's not an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the average retail price, not the per-item price. Wait, no, the question says "the minimum retail price that Field and Co. may charge for the rest of the dolls", so per doll.

Wait, looking at the options again: option J is $3.75, which is lower than 3.85. So that can't be, because selling at 3.75 per doll would give total revenue of 75*3.75 = 281.25, which plus 150 is 431.25.

Total cost is 325. So total markup is 431.25 -325 =106.25. 106.25 /325 = 0.3265, which is about 32.65%, less than 35%. So that's not enough.

So the correct S is 3.85, but it's not present. So perhaps there's a mistake in the setup.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the markup is calculated on selling price, not on cost. Oh wait, sometimes people get confused between markup and margin. Markup is based on cost, whereas margin is based on selling price. So maybe the question intended margin?

Wait, the question says "average retail markup is 35%". So markup is on cost. So I think my initial approach is correct.

Wait, maybe the purchase price per doll is $3.25, but when they sell some at higher, the average markup is a weighted average. So perhaps I should compute the total markup and then find the required per-unit markup for the remaining.

Let me try that.

Total desired markup is 35% of total cost: 0.35*325 = $113.75.

They've already sold 25 dolls at $6 each. So their markup on each of these is 6 -3.25 = $2.75 per doll. So total markup from these 25 is 25*2.75 = $68.75.

So the remaining 75 dolls must contribute the remaining markup: 113.75 -68.75 = $45.

So the total markup needed from the remaining 75 dolls is $45. So per doll, that's 45 /75 = $0.60.

So the selling price per remaining doll should be cost + markup: 3.25 +0.60 = $3.85.

Same result again. So I'm confident that the correct answer is $3.85, but it's not among the options provided. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question meant something else. Let me read it again.

The question says: "What is the minimum retail price that Field and Co. may charge for the rest of the dolls in order that the average retail markup is 35%?"

Wait, perhaps the average markup is per doll, not overall. So the average markup across all 100 dolls is 35% per doll.

So each doll's selling price should be such that the total markup is 35% of total cost.

Wait, but that's what I did earlier. So if each of the remaining 75 dolls is sold at S, then the total markup is 25*(6-3.25) +75*(S-3.25) = 25*(2.75) +75*(S-3.25).

This should equal 35% of total cost, which is 0.35*325=113.75.

So 25*2.75 is 68.75.

So 68.75 +75*(S-3.25) =113.75.

Subtract 68.75: 75*(S-3.25)=45.

Divide by 75: S-3.25=0.6.

So S=3.85.

Again same result. So perhaps the options are wrong, or I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the total markup to be 35% on the total selling price, but that would be margin, not markup.

Wait, if the average markup is 35%, which is on cost. So perhaps the options are incorrect, but assuming that, I have to choose the closest.

Looking at the options, the closest higher than 3.85 is option E:4.67, but that's higher, and option A:4.38 is higher than 3.85. Wait, no, 3.85 is lower than 4.38.

Wait, but I'm getting 3.85, which isn't present. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the 35% markup is on the average cost, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the markup is calculated per item, and the average of the markups is 35%, which would be a different calculation.

Wait, let me try that. The average markup per item is 35% of cost.

So each item's markup is 35% of 3.25, which is 1.1375. So each item's selling price is 4.3875.

Now, some items are sold above this, some below. But the average markup per item is 35%.

So the total markup across all 100 items should be 100 *1.1375=113.75, same as before.

So again, same result: remaining dolls need to contribute 45 in total markup, so 0.6 each, leading to 3.85 selling price.

Hmm. I'm stuck because the correct calculation leads me to 3.85, which isn't an option. So perhaps I made a mistake in initial steps.

Wait, perhaps the total cost isn't 325. Let me recheck: 100 dolls at 3.25 each. 100*3.25 is 325. Correct.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the 25 dolls were sold at a markup higher than 35%, and the rest need to be at a lower markup, but the average remains 35%.

Alternatively, perhaps the 35% is the average markup on selling price, which would be different.

Wait, if the average markup is 35% on cost, which is the usual definition. But if it's 35% on selling price, that's a margin, not markup.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using markup on selling price, not cost. Let me try that.

If the average markup is 35% of selling price, then the formula would be different.

So, average markup = 35% = (SP - Cost)/SP.

So for the total, (Total SP - Total Cost)/Total SP = 0.35.

Wait, let me compute that.

Total SP would then be 325 / (1-0.35) = 325 /0.65 ≈ 500.

Because (Total SP -325)/Total SP =0.35 → 1 - 325/Total SP =0.35 → 325/Total SP=0.65 → Total SP=325/0.65≈500.

So total SP needed is approximately $500.

They've already sold 25 dolls for $150, so remaining 75 must bring in 500 -150=350.

So 75 dolls must bring in $350. So per doll, that's 350/75≈4.6667, which is approximately $4.67.

Looking at the options, E is $4.67. So that's an option.

But wait, this approach assumes that the average markup is 35% of selling price, which is actually the margin, not the markup. Because markup is typically based on cost, whereas margin is based on selling price.

But perhaps the question is using the term incorrectly. If that's the case, then the answer would be E: $4.67.

So perhaps the intended approach is to calculate based on margin, not markup.

Given that, perhaps I should choose option E.

But I'm a bit confused because the term 'markup' usually refers to cost-based. But maybe the question is using it differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier when considering the total.

Wait, let me do this approach.

If the average markup is 35% on selling price, then:

Markup = 0.35 * SP.

And since Markup = SP - Cost,

SP - Cost = 0.35 SP → Cost = 0.65 SP.

So SP = Cost /0.65.

But for total, the total cost is 325.

So total SP would be 325 /0.65 ≈ 500.

So total SP needed is 500.

They have 150 from the first 25, so remaining 75 must bring 350.

350 /75 ≈4.6667, which is $4.67. So option E.

So perhaps the intended answer is E, $4.67.

I think that's the case because it's one of the options, and my initial approach didn't match any options, but this does.
</think>

To determine the minimum retail price Field and Co. may charge for the remaining dolls to achieve an average retail markup of 35%, we proceed as follows:

1. **Total Cost Calculation**:  
   Field and Co. purchased 100 dolls at $3.25 each.  
   Total cost = \( 100 \times 3.25 = 325 \, \text{dollars} \).

2. **Revenue from 25 Dolls Sold**:  
   They sold 25 dolls at $6 each.  
   Revenue from these sales = \( 25 \times 6 = 150 \, \text{dollars} \).

3. **Desired Total Markup**:  
   The average retail markup is 35% of the total cost.  
   Total markup = \( 0.35 \times 325 = 113.75 \, \text{dollars} \).

4. **Total Selling Price Required**:  
   Total selling price = Total cost + Total markup = \( 325 + 113.75 = 438.75 \, \text{dollars} \).

5. **Revenue Needed from Remaining 75 Dolls**:  
   Revenue from remaining 75 dolls = Total selling price - Revenue from 25 dolls  
   = \( 438.75 - 150 = 288.75 \, \text{dollars} \).

6. **Minimum Retail Price for Remaining Dolls**:  
   Let \( S \) be the selling price
