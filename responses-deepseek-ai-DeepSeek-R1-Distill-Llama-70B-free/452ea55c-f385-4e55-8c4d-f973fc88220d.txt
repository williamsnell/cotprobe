Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a flywheel in a cutting machine. Hmm, let me try to understand what's being asked. The question is about finding the average cutting force exerted by the machine during a cutting stroke. 

Alright, let's read the problem again carefully. The flywheel has a mass of 62.5 slugs and a radius of gyration of 3 feet. At the start, it's rotating at 120 revolutions per minute, and after the cut, it's at 90 rev/min. The stroke is 6 inches, and I need to find the average cutting force. 

Wait, I remember that when a flywheel does work, like cutting something, it's related to the change in its rotational kinetic energy. So the idea is that the work done by the cutting force is equal to the change in kinetic energy of the flywheel. 

Right, the formula I think is Work = Force * distance. But since it's rotational, I might need to use torque instead. Oh wait, no, the work done by a force is force times distance, but in this case, the force is applied over a linear distance as the cutting stroke happens. So the flywheel's change in rotational energy would be equal to the work done by that force.

So the work done by the cutting force is F_avg * d, where d is the distance of the stroke. And the change in kinetic energy is the final kinetic energy minus the initial. 

Kinetic energy for rotation is (1/2) I ω², where I is the moment of inertia. Since I is mass times radius of gyration squared, I = m k². So the change in KE is (1/2) m k² (ω_final² - ω_initial²).

But wait, the speeds are given in revolutions per minute. I need to convert those to radians per second because angular velocity in KE is in rad/s. Oh right, because 1 revolution is 2π radians, and 1 minute is 60 seconds. So I'll have to convert both 120 and 90 rpm to rad/s.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the initial and final angular velocities in rad/s.
2. Compute the change in rotational kinetic energy (ΔKE).
3. Set this ΔKE equal to the work done by the average force, which is F_avg multiplied by the stroke distance, d.
4. Solve for F_avg.

Okay, let's get into each step.

First, converting rpm to rad/s. The formula is ω (rad/s) = (rpm * 2π) / 60. 

So initial ω_initial = 120 rpm * 2π /60. Let me compute that: 120/60 is 2. So 2 * 2π = 4π rad/s. 

Similarly, ω_final = 90 rpm * 2π /60. 90/60 is 1.5. So 1.5 * 2π = 3π rad/s.

Wait, wait, no. Let me do the math again. 120 rpm: (120 rev/min) * (2π rad/rev) * (1 min/60 sec) → 120*2π/60 = (120/60)*2π → 2 * 2π = 4π rad/s. Yep, that's correct.

For ω_final, 90 rpm: 90 * 2π /60 = (90/60)*2π → 1.5 * 2π → 3π rad/s. Got it.

Now, ΔKE is (1/2) m k² (ω_final² - ω_initial²). Wait, wait, no, because the flywheel is slowing down, so the KE is decreasing. So the work done by the cutting force is equal to the loss in KE. So the change would be final KE minus initial KE, which is negative. But since work done by the cutting force is positive, we take the magnitude.

So, the change in KE is (1/2) m k² (ω_final² - ω_initial²).

Wait, but let me think again. The flywheel is doing work on the material being cut. So its KE decreases, so the work done by the flywheel is the loss in KE. So Work = KE_initial - KE_final = (1/2)m k² (ω_initial² - ω_final²). So that's the work done by the flywheel, which equals the average force times the distance.

So:

Work = F_avg * d = (1/2) m k² (ω_initial² - ω_final²).

Alright, so now I can plug in the numbers.

Given:

m = 62.5 slugs

k = 3 ft

d = 6 inches. Oh wait, I need to convert that to feet because the units need to be consistent. So 6 inches is 0.5 feet.

ω_initial = 4π rad/s

ω_final = 3π rad/s

So let's compute each part.

First, m k²: 62.5 * (3)^2 = 62.5 * 9 = let's see, 60*9=540, 2.5*9=22.5, so 540+22.5=562.5 slug-ft².

Then, (ω_initial² - ω_final²) = (4π)^2 - (3π)^2 = (16π²) - (9π²) = 7 π².

Putting it all together:

Work = (1/2) * 562.5 * 7 π².

Wait, let me compute that step by step.

First, (1/2) * 562.5 = 281.25.

Then multiply by 7: 281.25 *7 = 1968.75.

Then multiply by π². Hmm, π is approximately 3.1416, so π² is about 9.8696.

So 1968.75 * 9.8696 ≈ let's compute that.

Wait, but instead of approximating, maybe I should keep it symbolic first and see if it's needed. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation can be done without approximating π yet.

Wait, the formula for work is:

Work = (1/2) m k^2 (ω_i^2 - ω_f^2) 

Which is:

(1/2) * 62.5 * 3^2 * [(4π)^2 - (3π)^2]

= (1/2)*62.5*9*(16π² -9π²)

= (1/2)*562.5 *7 π²

= 281.25 *7 π²

=1968.75 * π².

Now, work is also F_avg * distance.

So F_avg = Work / d.

Work is 1968.75 * π² ft-lbs, since slug-ft is unit of momentum, but in terms of energy, the units would be in slug*ft²/s², which is equivalent to ft-lbf (foot-pound-force). Wait, because 1 slug = 1 lbf*s²/ft. So when you multiply by ft², you get ft-lbf. So yes, the work is in ft-lbf.

The distance d is 0.5 ft.

So F_avg = (1968.75 * π² ) / 0.5.

Which is 1968.75 * π² / 0.5 = 3937.5 * π².

Hmm, computing that: π² is approximately 9.8696, so 3937.5 *9.8696.

Wait, but wait, let me compute that.

3937.5 *9.8696 ≈ Let me break it down.

First, 3937.5 * 10 = 39375.

But 9.8696 is about 0.1304 less than 10. So 3937.5 * (10 - 0.1304) = 3937.5 *10 - 3937.5 *0.1304.

3937.5 *0.1304 ≈ Let's calculate.

0.1 * 3937.5 = 393.75

0.03 * 3937.5 = 118.125

0.0004 *3937.5 ≈ 1.575.

So total ≈ 393.75 +118.125 +1.575= 513.45.

Wait, wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 0.1304 is 0.1 + 0.03 + 0.0004.

So 3937.5 * 0.1 =393.75

3937.5 * 0.03 =118.125

3937.5 * 0.0004≈ 1.575

So sum is 393.75 + 118.125 =511.875 +1.575=513.45.

So 3937.5 *9.8696 ≈39375 -513.45=38861.55 lb.

Wait, so F_avg ≈ 38861.55 lb.

Looking at the options, option A is 38861.6 lb. So that's probably the correct answer.

But wait, let me cross-check my calculations. Let me recompute the steps.

Wait, another approach: Since the work done is force times distance, and the work is equal to the change in KE.

Let me compute the initial and final KE.

Initial KE: (1/2)*I*ω_i².

I is m k² =62.5 * 3^2 =562.5 slug-ft².

ω_i =4π rad/s.

So initial KE: 0.5 *562.5 * (4π)^2.

=0.5 *562.5 *16 π².

=281.25 *16 π².

=4500 π².

Similarly, final KE: 0.5 *562.5 * (3π)^2.

=0.5 *562.5 *9 π².

=281.25 *9 π².

=2531.25 π².

So ΔKE =4500 π² -2531.25 π² =1968.75 π² ft-lbf.

Work done is equal to this ΔKE, which is 1968.75 π².

Then, work = F_avg * d → F_avg = work / d.

d is 0.5 ft.

So F_avg = (1968.75 π² ) / 0.5 = 3937.5 π².

Now, π² is approximately 9.8696.

So 3937.5 *9.8696.

Let me compute 3937.5 * 9.8696.

Another way: 3937.5 *9 =35437.5

3937.5 *0.8 =3150

3937.5 *0.0696 → Let's compute 3937.5 *0.06 =236.25; 3937.5 *0.0096≈37.8.

So 236.25 +37.8=274.05.

So adding all parts:

35437.5 +3150 =38587.5

Plus 274.05 →38861.55 lb.

So yes, about 38861.55 lb. So option A is 38861.6 lb, which matches.

So the answer should be A.

To determine the average cutting force exerted by the flywheel, we equate the work done by the cutting force to the change in the flywheel's rotational kinetic energy. The rotational kinetic energy is given by:

\[
KE = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2
\]

where \( I = m k^2 \) is the moment of inertia, \( m \) is the mass, \( k \) is the radius of gyration, and \( \omega \) is the angular velocity in radians per second. The work done by the cutting force is:

\[
\text{Work} = F_{\text{avg}} \cdot d
\]

where \( d \) is the stroke distance. The change in kinetic energy is:

\[
\Delta KE = KE_{\text{initial}} - KE_{\text{final}} = \frac{1}{2} m k^2 \left( \omega_{\text{initial}}^2 - \omega_{\text{final}}^2 \right)
\]

### Step 1: Convert rotational speeds to radians per second
The initial and final angular velocities are given in revolutions per minute (rpm). Converting to radians per second:

\[
\omega_{\text{initial}} = 120 \, \text{rpm} \cdot \frac{2\pi \, \text{rad}}{1 \, \text{rev}} \cdot \frac{1 \, \text{min}}{60 \, \text{s}} = 4\pi \, \text{rad/s}
\]

\[
\omega_{\text{final}} = 90 \, \text{rpm} \cdot \frac{2\pi \, \text{rad}}{1 \, \text{rev}} \cdot \frac{1 \, \text{min}}{60 \, \text{s}} = 3\pi \, \text{rad/s}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the change in kinetic energy
The moment of inertia is:

\[
I = m k^2 = 62.5 \, \text{slugs} \cdot (3 \, \text{ft})^2 = 562.5 \, \text{slug-ft}^2
\]

The change in kinetic energy is:

\[
\Delta KE = \frac{1}{2} I \left( \omega_{\text{initial}}^2 - \omega_{\text{final}}^2 \right)
\]

Substituting values:

\[
\Delta KE = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 562.5 \cdot \left( (4\pi)^2 - (3\pi)^2 \right)
\]

\[
\Delta KE = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 562.5 \cdot \left( 16\pi^2 - 9\pi^2 \right) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 562.5 \cdot 7\pi^2 = 1968.75 \pi^2 \, \text{ft-lbf}
\]

### Step 3: Relate work to the average cutting force
The work done by the cutting force is:

\[
\text{Work} = F_{\text{avg}} \cdot d
\]

The stroke distance is \( d = 6 \, \text{inches} = 0.5 \, \text{ft} \). Substituting:

\[
F_{\text{avg}} = \frac{\text{Work}}{d} = \frac{1968.75 \pi^2}{0.5} = 3937.5 \pi^2
\]

### Step 4: Compute the numerical value
Using \( \pi^2 \approx 9.8696 \):

\[
F_{\text{avg}} = 3937.5 \cdot 9.8696 \approx 38861.6 \, \text{lb}
\]

### Final Answer:
The average cutting force exerted is approximately **38861.6 lb**, which corresponds to option **A**.
