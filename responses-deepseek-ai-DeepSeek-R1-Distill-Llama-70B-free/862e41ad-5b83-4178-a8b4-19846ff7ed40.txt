Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about jurisprudence, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's see what the question is asking.

The question is about who recognized the distinction between general and particular jurisprudence. The options are A through I, with names like Kelsen, Hart, Roscoe Pound, Dworkin, Austin, and others.

Hmm, I remember that jurisprudence is the philosophy of law, right? And there are different types or approaches within it. The terms "general" and "particular" jurisprudence aren't ringing a bell immediately, so I'll have to think about what each of these theorists is known for.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Kelsen. Hans Kelsen was a legal philosopher known for the Pure Theory of Law. He focused on the hierarchical structure of the law and the basic norm. I'm not sure if he specifically talked about general vs. particular jurisprudence. Maybe not.

Option B: Hart. H.L.A. Hart was a key figure in analytical jurisprudence. He wrote "The Concept of Law," where he discussed laws as social rules and the distinction between primary and secondary rules. I think Hart was more about the structure of legal systems rather than a split into general and particular.

Option C: Roscoe Pound. He was an American jurist who developed sociological jurisprudence. He emphasized the role of law in society and the need for law to adapt to social needs. I'm not sure about the specific terms here.

Option D: Dworkin. Ronald Dworkin is known for his theory of law as integrity and the idea that the law is a matter of interpretation, with principles playing a key role. His work is more about adjudication and legal interpretation.

Option E: Austin. John Austin is known as the father of legal positivism. He defined law as the command of a sovereign, backed by sanctions. His approach was more about the definition and sources of law.

Option F: Holland. Thomas Erskine Holland contributed to analytical jurisprudence. He wrote about the elements of jurisprudence and the structure of legal systems. I think he might have made a distinction between general and particular, but I'm not certain.

Option G: Blackstone. William Blackstone wrote the famous Commentaries on the Laws of England. His work was more about the exposition of the law as it exists rather than theoretical distinctions. So probably not him.

Option H: Holmes. Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. was a proponent of legal realism. He believed that law is what the courts decide and focused on the predictive aspects of the law. Not sure about the general vs particular here.

Option I: Salmond. John Salmond was a legal philosopher from New Zealand. He wrote on jurisprudence and legal theory. I think he made a distinction between general jurisprudence, which deals with the fundamental principles of law as a whole, and particular jurisprudence, which deals with specific legal systems or branches of law. That sounds familiar. So maybe Salmond is the right answer.

Wait, but I'm trying to remember. Did Salmond actually use those terms? I think so. General jurisprudence would be the broader theory applicable to all legal systems, while particular would be about specific areas or systems. That makes sense.

So looking back, the options are I for Salmond.

I don't think it's Holland because I don't recall him making that particular distinction. Hart, Kelsen, and others were more about different aspects. So the answer should be I.

The question asks which legal theorist recognized the distinction between general and particular jurisprudence. After analyzing each option:

- **A: Kelsen** focused on the Pure Theory of Law, not this distinction.
- **B: Hart** discussed the structure of legal systems but not this specific split.
- **C: Roscoe Pound** emphasized sociological jurisprudence, unrelated to these terms.
- **D: Dworkin** focused on legal interpretation, not this distinction.
- **E: Austin** defined law as a sovereign's command, not relevant here.
- **F: Holland** contributed to analytical jurisprudence but didn't make this distinction.
- **G: Blackstone** wrote about existing law, not theoretical distinctions.
- **H: Holmes** was a legal realist, not associated with these terms.
- **I: Salmond** is known for distinguishing between general jurisprudence (fundamental principles of law) and particular jurisprudence (specific systems or branches).

Thus, the correct answer is **I: Salmond**.

I
