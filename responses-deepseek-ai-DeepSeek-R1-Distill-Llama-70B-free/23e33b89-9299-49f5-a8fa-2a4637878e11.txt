Question:

A 16-year-old girl is brought to the office by her mother because she is concerned that she may have contracted meningitis from her soccer teammate, who was diagnosed with meningococcal meningitis and admitted to the hospital yesterday. The patient's soccer team traveled to a neighboring state to participate in a tournament 1 week ago and she shared a hotel room with the girl who was hospitalized. The patient feels well but is concerned she may have "caught the same bug." Medical history is remarkable for asthma. Medications include inhaled albuterol. Vital signs are temperature 37.2°C (98.9°F), pulse 64/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 107/58 mm Hg. Physical examination shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention for this patient at this time?

Options:

A: Administer a tetanus shot
B: Prescribe azithromycin
C: Administer the meningococcal vaccine
D: Prescribe ibuprofen
E: Prescribe penicillin
F: Administer the pneumococcal vaccine
G: Prescribe amoxicillin
H: Prescribe doxycycline
I: Prescribe rifampin
J: No intervention is needed at this time

Okay, so I've got this question about a 16-year-old girl whose teammate has meningococcal meningitis. The girl is worried she might have caught it. Let me try to break this down.

First, meningococcal meningitis is caused by the bacterium Neisseria meningitidis. It's known to spread through close contact, like sharing a room or being in close quarters, which makes sense here because they shared a hotel room.

The patient's vitals are all normal—temperature is slightly below normal, actually, so no fever. Physical exam is normal too, so she doesn't show any symptoms right now. Her history is asthma, which is probably irrelevant here unless medications interfere.

The question is about the appropriate intervention. Let me think about what's needed in such a situation. When someone is exposed to meningococcal meningitis, especially in a close setting like sharing a room, prophylaxis is usually recommended. The goal is to eliminate the bacteria from the nasopharynx to prevent infection and spread.

Common antibiotics used for prophylaxis include ciprofloxacin, rifampin, or ceftriaxone. But I'm not sure which one is typically used in different age groups. Let me recall: I think rifampin is often used, but maybe cipro as well. However, looking at the options, I don't see cipro here. Wait, looking at the options, option I is rifampin, and option E is penicillin, which I don't think is right because penicillin is more for treatment once symptoms are present, not prophylaxis.

Wait, no, wait. Penicillin is sometimes used for prophylaxis, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. For close contacts, the CDC recommends prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin, rifampin, or ceftriaxone. So in the options, I see rifampin (I), and also option E is penicillin, which I don't think is used for prophylaxis. So option I, rifampin, seems possible.

But wait, another thought: the girl is asymptomatic. So the treatment is prophylactic antibiotics, not something like meningococcal vaccine, which is a preventive measure but not immediate. The vaccine (option C) would take time to be effective, and she's already been exposed, so it's probably too late for that.

So the choices come down to antibiotics for prophylaxis. Now, which one is appropriate?

Rifampin is often used for prophylaxis in such cases. So option I is to prescribe rifampin. Alternatively, in some cases, ciprofloxacin is given as a single dose, but that's not one of the options here. So I think the answer is I.

Wait, but let me make sure. The patient is 16, so an adult dose would apply. Rifampin is typically given twice daily for two days. But does that apply here? I think yes.

Looking back at the options:

A: Tetanus shot—unrelated.

B: Azithromycin—not typically for meningococcus.

C: Meningococcal vaccine—not effective immediately.

D: Ibuprofen—no, she’s asymptomatic.

E: Penicillin—maybe for treatment, not prophylaxis.

F: Pneumococcal vaccine—unrelated.

G: Amoxicillin—probably not the first choice for meningococcus prophylaxis.

H: Doxycycline—used for other things like Lyme, maybe not here.

J: No intervention—probably not, because she was exposed.

So I'm leaning towards option I: Prescribe rifampin.

The patient is a 16-year-old girl who was exposed to a teammate diagnosed with meningococcal meningitis. She is asymptomatic with normal vital signs and no physical exam abnormalities. Meningococcal meningitis is caused by Neisseria meningitidis and can spread through close contact, such as sharing a hotel room. Prophylaxis is recommended for close contacts to prevent infection and spread.

The appropriate intervention involves antibiotics that can eliminate Neisseria meningitidis from the nasopharynx. Common options for prophylaxis include ciprofloxacin, rifampin, or ceftriaxone. Among the provided options, rifampin (option I) is suitable for prophylaxis in this scenario. The meningococcal vaccine (option C) is not effective immediately after exposure, and penicillin (option E) is typically used for treatment, not prophylaxis. Other options, such as azithromycin, ibuprofen, amoxicillin, or doxycycline, are not standard choices for meningococcal prophylaxis.

Given the exposure and the need for immediate prophylaxis, the most appropriate intervention is to prescribe rifampin.
