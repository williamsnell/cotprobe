Okay, so I've got this statistics problem here about determining the sample size for a public opinion poll. The question is about finding out how large a sample should be taken so that the maximum error of the estimate of p is 0.03 with 95% confidence. Hmm, I remember that this has to do with confidence intervals and margin of error.

Let me think. I recall the formula for the margin of error (E) when estimating a proportion is E = z * sqrt((p*(1-p))/n), where z is the z-score for the desired confidence level. Since the confidence level is 95%, I think the z-score is about 1.96. Wait, I should double-check that. Yeah, I'm pretty sure for 95% confidence, it's 1.96.

Now, the problem says the maximum error should be 0.03. So E is 0.03. But the formula has p in it, and p is the proportion of voters favoring candidate A. However, since we don't know p in advance, we need to make an assumption to maximize the sample size. Oh right, because the maximum variance occurs when p is 0.5. So I should use p = 0.5 when calculating the required sample size to ensure the error doesn't exceed 0.03 for any p.

So plugging the values into the formula: 0.03 = 1.96 * sqrt((0.5 * 0.5)/n). Let me write that down:

0.03 = 1.96 * sqrt(0.25 / n)

I need to solve for n. Let's square both sides to get rid of the square root. 

(0.03)^2 = (1.96)^2 * (0.25 / n)

0.0009 = (3.8416) * (0.25 / n)

Wait, 1.96 squared is 3.8416, right. And 0.5*0.5 is 0.25.

So substituting that, 0.0009 equals 3.8416 times 0.25 divided by n.

Let me compute 3.8416 * 0.25 first. 3.8416 * 0.25 is about 0.9604.

So 0.0009 = 0.9604 / n

I can rearrange this to solve for n: n = 0.9604 / 0.0009

Let me calculate that. 0.9604 divided by 0.0009. Hmm, 0.9604 / 0.0009 is the same as 960.4 / 0.9. Let's see, 960.4 divided by 0.9. Well, 900 / 0.9 is 1000. 60.4 / 0.9 is approximately 67.11. So total is around 1067.11.

So n should be approximately 1067.11. But since the sample size has to be a whole number, we round up to the next whole number, which is 1068.

Looking at the options, option D is 1068. So the answer should be D.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let's go through it again quickly. 

E = z * sqrt(p(1-p)/n)

E is 0.03, z is 1.96, p is 0.5.

So 0.03 = 1.96 * sqrt(0.25/n)

Square both sides: 0.0009 = (3.8416) * (0.25 / n)

Multiply 3.8416 by 0.25: 0.9604.

So 0.0009 = 0.9604 / n → n ≈ 0.9604 / 0.0009 = 1067.111. Rounded up to 1068. Yep, that checks out. So I'm confident the answer is D.

To determine the required sample size for a public opinion poll where the maximum error of the estimate of \( p \) is 0.03 with 95% confidence, we use the formula for the margin of error:

\[
E = z \cdot \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}
\]

Here:
- \( E = 0.03 \) (maximum error),
- \( z = 1.96 \) (z-score for 95% confidence),
- \( p = 0.5 \) (assumed proportion to maximize variance).

Substituting these values into the formula:

\[
0.03 = 1.96 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{0.25}{n}}
\]

Squaring both sides to eliminate the square root:

\[
0.0009 = 3.8416 \cdot \frac{0.25}{n}
\]

Simplifying further:

\[
0.0009 = \frac{0.9604}{n}
\]

Rearranging to solve for \( n \):

\[
n = \frac{0.9604}{0.0009} \approx 1067.11
\]

Since the sample size must be a whole number, we round up to the next integer, giving \( n = 1068 \).

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**D: 1068**
