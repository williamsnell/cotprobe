Okay, so I have this logic problem here, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem is about constructing a truth table for a given argument and then determining if the argument is valid or invalid. If it's invalid, I need to pick a counterexample from the options provided.

The argument is presented in two premises and a conclusion:

1. ~C ⊃ D
2. D ⊃ C
3. Therefore, C

So, I need to evaluate whether this argument is valid. To do that, I think the best approach is to build a truth table for all possible truth values of the propositions C and D. Then, I can check if there's any situation where the premises are true, but the conclusion is false. If such a situation exists, the argument is invalid, and that situation would be the counterexample.

Alright, let's start by setting up the truth table. Since there are two propositions, C and D, there will be four possible combinations of truth values: both true, both false, C true and D false, and C false and D true.

The premises are ~C → D and D → C. The conclusion is C. I'll need to evaluate the truth value of each premise and the conclusion for each possible combination.

Let me write out the columns for the truth table:

- C
- D
- ~C
- ~C → D
- D → C
- Conclusion: C

Wait, actually, since the conclusion is just C, but I need to check if whenever both premises are true, the conclusion is also true. So the structure is:

For each row (each combination of C and D), compute the truth values of the two premises. If both premises are true, then check if the conclusion is true. If in any case both premises are true and the conclusion is false, that's a counterexample, making the argument invalid.

Let me go through each possible scenario.

1. **Case 1: C is True, D is True**

   - ~C is False (since C is True)
   - ~C → D: False → True is True (because in material implication, a false premise makes the implication true regardless)
   - D → C: True → True is True
   - Conclusion C is True
   - So both premises are true, and conclusion is true. No problem here.

2. **Case 2: C is True, D is False**

   - ~C is False
   - ~C → D: False → False is True
   - D → C: False → True is True (because the antecedent is false)
   - Conclusion C is True
   - Both premises true, conclusion true. Still valid.

3. **Case 3: C is False, D is True**

   - ~C is True
   - ~C → D: True → True is True
   - D → C: True → False is False (because the antecedent is true and consequent is false)
   - Conclusion C is False
   - So here, the first premise (~C → D) is true, but the second premise (D → C) is false. Since both premises need to be true for the argument to hold, this case doesn't affect the validity because the premises aren't both true.

4. **Case 4: C is False, D is False**

   - ~C is True
   - ~C → D: True → False is False
   - D → C: False → False is True (because the antecedent is false)
   - Conclusion C is False
   - Here, the first premise is false, so again, both premises aren't true at the same time. So this doesn't provide a counterexample.

Wait, but looking at the cases, is there any scenario where both premises are true but the conclusion is false?

From the four cases:

- In case 1: Both premises true, conclusion true.
- Case 2: Both premises true, conclusion true.
- Case 3: First premise true, second premise false.
- Case 4: First premise false, second premise true.

So in none of the cases do both premises being true lead to the conclusion being false. That suggests that the argument is valid.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake in evaluating the implications.

Let me re-examine case 3: C is false, D is true.

- ~C → D: Since ~C is true (C is false), and D is true, so implication is true.
- D → C: D is true, C is false → implication is false.

So in this case, the first premise is true, the second is false. So both premises can't be true here.

Is there any case where both premises are true and the conclusion is false?

Looking again:

Only when both premises are true. Let's see:

- For both premises to be true, both implications must be true.

Case 1: C and D are both true → both premises true, conclusion true.

Case 2: C is true, D is false → first premise is true (because ~C is false), second premise is D→C which is false→true → which is true. Wait, no: D is false, so D→C is automatically true regardless of C. So in case 2, both premises are true, and conclusion is true.

Wait a second, in case 2: C is true, D is false.

- ~C is false → ~C→D is true (because false implies anything is true).
- D is false → D→C: false → true is true.

So both premises are true, and the conclusion (C) is true.

So in all cases where both premises are true, the conclusion is also true. Therefore, the argument is valid.

Wait, but this seems counterintuitive. Let me think about it differently.

The argument is:

~C → D

D → C

Therefore, C.

This seems like a classic example of contraposition and hypothetical syllogism.

From the two premises, can we derive C?

Wait, the first premise is ~C → D, which is equivalent to D∨C (contrapositive is C∨D? Wait, no: the contrapositive of ~C → D is ~D → C. So ~C → D is equivalent to C∨D.

Similarly, the second premise D→C is equivalent to ~D∨C.

So the two premises together are (C∨D) and (~D∨C). Let's write them in logical terms:

Premise1: C∨D

Premise2: ~D∨C

If we combine these, we can apply resolution:

C∨D

~D∨C

The two clauses have C and D, and ~D and C. Resolving on D and ~D, we get C∨C, which is just C. So yes, the conclusion is C.

So logically, this seems valid. So the argument is valid.

But wait, looking back at the options, option G says "Valid" and H says "Valid. No counterexample exists." Well, from the truth table analysis, there's no case where the premises are true and the conclusion is false, so the argument is valid.

So the correct answer should be G or H. But wait, the options are A to J, with G being "Valid" and H being "Valid. No counterexample exists."

Wait, the question asks to determine if the argument is valid or invalid, and if invalid, choose a counterexample. Since the argument is valid, the correct answer would be either G or H. But looking at the options, H says "Valid. No counterexample exists." Which is correct because a valid argument has no counterexamples.

So the answer should be H.

Wait, but let me make sure. The user's options are:

A: Invalid. Counterexample when C is true and D is false

B: Invalid. Counterexample when D is false and C is true

Wait, no. Let me look again.

The options are:

A: Invalid. Counterexample when C is true and D is false

B: Invalid. Counterexample when D is false and C is true

C: Invalid. Counterexample when C and D are true

D: Invalid. Counterexample when C and D are both false

E: Invalid. Counterexample when C is false and D is true

F: Invalid. Counterexample when D is true and C is false

G: Valid

H: Valid. No counterexample exists

I: Invalid. Counterexample when D and C are both true

Wait, so H says "Valid. No counterexample exists." Since our analysis shows that the argument is valid, then the correct answer is either G or H. But which one?

The question's instruction says: "Construct a complete truth table for the following argument. Then, using the truth table, determine whether the argument is valid or invalid. If the argument is invalid, choose an option which presents a counterexample."

Since the argument is valid, we don't need a counterexample. So the correct answer is either G or H.

Looking back, the options are:

G: Valid

H: Valid. No counterexample exists.

Which one is correct?

Since the argument is valid, H is more precise because it explicitly states that no counterexample exists. But both G and H are correct in stating validity. However, perhaps in the context of the question, since it's about constructing the truth table and determining validity, perhaps H is the intended correct answer.

Wait, but looking at the initial analysis, in the truth table, whenever both premises are true, the conclusion is true. So the argument is valid, and there's no counterexample. So H is correct.

But wait, let me look again. The first premise is ~C → D, the second is D → C.

Wait, if C is true, then from the second premise, D→C is automatically true because the consequent is true. If C is false, then from the first premise, ~C is true, so D must be true. But then, from the second premise, D→C would require that if D is true, then C must be true. But if D is true and C is false, that would make D→C false. Wait, that seems confusing.

Wait, let me re-examine case 3 where C is false and D is true.

In that case:

Premise1: ~C → D is true (since ~C is true, D is true, so implication holds).

Premise2: D → C is false (since D is true and C is false).

So in this case, the premises are not both true. So this doesn't count as a counterexample because both premises aren't true.

Wait, but if I have the premises as ~C→D and D→C, can I derive C?

Yes, because if D implies C, and ~C implies D, then suppose C is false. Then ~C is true, which implies D is true. But D being true implies C is true, which contradicts our assumption that C is false. Therefore, C cannot be false; hence, C must be true. So the argument is valid.

Another approach: using natural deduction.

From ~C → D (premise 1)

From D → C (premise 2)

We can use hypothetical syllogism: if ~C → D and D → C, then ~C → C.

But ~C → C is a contradiction unless C is a tautology.

Wait, ~C → C is equivalent to C∨C which is C, but wait, no. Wait, ~C → C is equivalent to C∨C, which is C. So from ~C → C, which is the same as C.

Wait, that's not exactly right. Let me think.

Wait, ~C → C is logically equivalent to C. Because in classical logic, the statement "if not C then C" is equivalent to C. Because if C is true, the implication holds. If C is false, then ~C is true, so the implication would require C to be true, which it's not, making the implication false. So ~C → C is equivalent to C.

So from the two premises, we can derive ~C → C, which is equivalent to C. Therefore, the conclusion follows, so the argument is valid.

Therefore, the correct answer is H: Valid. No counterexample exists.
</think>

To determine the validity of the argument, we construct a truth table for the propositions involved and evaluate the truth values of the premises and conclusion under all possible scenarios.

The argument is:

1. **~C → D**  
2. **D → C**  
3. **∴ C**

### Truth Table Analysis:

| **C** | **D** | **~C** | **~C → D** | **D → C** | **Conclusion (C)** |
|-------|-------|--------|------------|------------|--------------------|
| **T** | **T** | **F**  | **T**      | **T**      | **T**              |
| **T** | **F** | **F**  | **T**      | **T**      | **T**              |
| **F** | **T** | **T**  | **T**      | **F**      | **F**              |
| **F** | **F** | **T**  | **F**      | **T**      | **F**              |

### Key Observations:
1. For the argument to be valid, **whenever both premises (~C → D and D → C) are true, the conclusion (C) must also be true**.
2. Examining the truth table:
   - In rows where both premises are true (rows 1 and 2), the conclusion is also true.
   - In rows where the premises are not both true (rows 3 and 4), the conclusion does not need to be evaluated for validity.
3. There is no scenario where both premises are true, and the conclusion is false. Therefore, the argument is **valid**, and **no counterexample exists**.

### Logical Equivalence:
The premises can also be analyzed using logical equivalences:
- **~C → D** is equivalent to **C ∨ D**.
- **D → C** is equivalent to **~D ∨ C**.
- Combining these, we get **C ∨ D** and **~D ∨ C**, which simplifies to **C** through resolution. This confirms that the conclusion **C** necessarily follows from the premises.

### Conclusion:
The argument is **valid**, and **no counterexample exists**.
