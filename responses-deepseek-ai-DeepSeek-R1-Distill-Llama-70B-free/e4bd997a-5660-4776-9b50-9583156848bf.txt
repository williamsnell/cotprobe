The first nine offered to paint the house for amounts ranging from $10,000 to $12,500. The 10th bid was sent by telegram and was supposed to be for $10,000. However, the telegraph company made a mistake and transmitted the bid as $1,000. The homeowner immediately accepted the 1 0th bid, but the 1 0 painter refused to perform. The I 0th painter's best defense in an action for breach of contract by the homeowner would be

Options:

A: that the homeowner should have been aware of the mistaken transmission, because of the disparity between its bid and the others.
B: that the telegraph company should be liable as an independent contractor.
C: that the homeowner deliberately exploited the telegraph company's mistake.
D: that the telegraph company's mistake nullifies the contractual agreement.
E: that the homeowner's immediate acceptance of the bid was unreasonable.
F: that the discrepancy between the bid and the actual cost of painting is too large.
G: that the mistake made the contract unconscionable.
H: that the homeowner was under an affirmative duty to investigate all submitted bids.
I: that the bid was not legally binding as it was sent via telegram.
J: that the homeowner failed to provide accurate specifications for the job.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this contract law question. Let's see what it's about. 

The scenario is a homeowner who wants his house painted. He contacts several painters and gets 10 bids. The first nine are between $10k and $12.5k. The tenth bid was supposed to be $10k but because of a telegraph mistake, it came as $1k. The homeowner accepted the $1k bid, but the painter refused to do the work. Now, the homeowner is suing for breach of contract, and we need to find the painter's best defense.

Hmm, contract law... I remember that for a contract to be valid, there needs to be offer, acceptance, and consideration. Also, mistakes can sometimes void a contract. So, the painter probably is arguing that there was a mistake in the transmission of the bid.

Let me think about mistake in contract law. There's the concept of mutual mistake and unilateral mistake. A mutual mistake is when both parties make the same mistake, but a unilateral mistake is when only one party is mistaken. If the telegraph company made a mistake, then the painter's offer was actually $10k, but it was sent as $1k. So the painter didn't intend to offer $1k; that was an error.

In this case, the homeowner received a bid of $1k, which is way lower than the others. The first nine were between 10k and 12.5k, so $1k is an order of magnitude lower. That's a big difference. So the question is, can the painter get out of the contract by saying there was a mistake?

I think the rule is that if a unilateral mistake is so obvious that the other party should have known about it, then the contract can be voided. Like, if someone offers to sell a car for $100 instead of $10,000, and the buyer accepts, the seller can say there was a mistake, and the buyer should have realized it was a mistake.

So the painter's defense would be that the homeowner should have known the bid was a mistake because of the huge disparity. If the bid was so low compared to the others, it's reasonable to assume the homeowner should have been aware something was wrong.

Looking at the options:

Option A says that the homeowner should have been aware because of the disparity. That makes sense. 

Option G mentions unconscionability, which is when the contract is so one-sided it's unfair. But unconscionability usually requires knowledge of the unfairness, and here the issue is a mistake, not necessarily unconscionability.

Option E says the acceptance was unreasonable. Well, the homeowner accepted quickly, but the issue is more about the mistake rather than the timing.

Option D says the telegraph mistake nullifies the contract. That's a bit vague. The mistake would be a basis for rescission, but the reason is more specific.

So the best defense is probably A. The homeowner should have realized the bid was mistakenly transmitted because it was way too low compared to the others.

The best defense for the 10th painter is that the homeowner should have been aware of the mistake due to the significant disparity between the $1,000 bid and the other bids, which ranged from $10,000 to $12,500. This makes option A the correct choice.

Answer: A
