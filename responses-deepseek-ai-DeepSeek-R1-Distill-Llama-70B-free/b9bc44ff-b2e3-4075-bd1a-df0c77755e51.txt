Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Liang, a talented student from another country, received degrees from several universities in the United States and then decided to stay in the states to teach. Could a state law requiring citizenship for teachers prevent him from doing so?

Options:

A: No, there is no compelling state interest.
B: Yes, because the teacher could exert too much influence.
C: No, because the Equal Protection Clause would protect him.
D: Yes, because states can regulate aliens.
E: Yes, because the state has the right to set its own educational policies.
F: Yes, because the state has an interest in ensuring that teachers understand and can teach American values.
G: No, because the state cannot discriminate against non-citizens.
H: No, because a state cannot discriminate based on nationality.
I: No, unless they use the rationally related to a legitimate state interest standard.
J: Yes, because the state can set its own employment criteria.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about whether a state law requiring citizenship for teachers would prevent Liang, who is a non-citizen, from teaching. Hmm. I remember from my studies that there's something about equal protection and discrimination based on citizenship. Let me think this through.

I think the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is relevant here. It says that states can't deny equal protection under the law. So if a state law discriminates against non-citizens, that might be a problem. But wait, I also recall that states can sometimes impose residency requirements or other qualifications, but citizenship is a stricter condition.

There's a Supreme Court case I'm trying to remember. Oh right, I think it was the case where the Court ruled that a state couldn't require a person to be a citizen to work as a public school teacher. The case was something like In re Griffiths, but maybe I'm mixing it up. Alternatively, it might have been a case where the court struck down a law requiring citizenship for certain public jobs because it violated equal protection.

Wait, the case I'm thinking of is probably Foley v. Connelie, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's Sugarman v. Dougall. Oh yeah, Sugarman v. Dougall involved a challenge to a state law requiring citizenship for certain civil service positions. The Supreme Court held that it was unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause because it discriminated against aliens. So states can't impose citizenship requirements unless there's a compelling state interest.

So applying that to this question, a state law requiring citizenship for teachers would likely be unconstitutional because it's discriminating against non-citizens without a compelling reason. The Equal Protection Clause protects against such discrimination unless the state can show a very strong reason, which teaching American values might not be enough.

Looking at the options, option C says "No, because the Equal Protection Clause would protect him." That seems right because the state can't just exclude non-citizens without a compelling interest. Option G says "No, because the state cannot discriminate against non-citizens." That's also a possibility, but I think C is more specific about the Equal Protection Clause.

Alternatively, option F says "Yes, because the state has an interest in ensuring teachers understand and can teach American values." But I don't think that's a strong enough reason. The court has generally struck down such laws unless the job directly relates to a government function involving sovereignty, like a policymaker or something.

So the correct answer should be either C or G. Option G is a bit more general about discrimination, whereas C ties it directly to the Equal Protection Clause, which is the legal basis. So I think the answer is C.

Wait, but let me make sure. Another angle is that citizenship requirements for public employment have been struck down as violating equal protection. So the state can't do that unless there's a specific reason. So Liang would be protected by the Equal Protection Clause, making the state law unconstitutional.

The correct answer is based on the understanding that state laws requiring citizenship for certain positions, such as teaching, are generally unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This clause prohibits states from discriminating against individuals unless there is a compelling state interest. In cases like *Sugarman v. Dougall*, the Supreme Court ruled that such citizenship requirements for public employment are unconstitutional because they discriminate against non-citizens without a sufficiently strong justification. While the state might argue an interest in having teachers understand and teach American values, this is typically not deemed a compelling enough reason. Therefore, Liang would be protected by the Equal Protection Clause, making the state law unconstitutional.

The best answer is C.
