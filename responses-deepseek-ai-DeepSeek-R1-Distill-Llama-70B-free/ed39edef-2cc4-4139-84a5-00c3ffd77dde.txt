Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which statement about a monopoly is true. I remember from my economics class that a monopoly is a market structure where there's only one seller of a product. So let's go through each option one by one.

Option A says it sets a price below average variable cost to drive competitors out. Wait, I think that's predatory pricing, but isn't that usually done by a firm to eliminate competition before raising prices again? But in a monopoly, since there are no competitors, maybe that's not the case. Or perhaps it's a way to prevent new entrants.

Option B says it competes with many firms selling the same product. No, that's more like perfect competition. Monopoly is the opposite, with only one firm.

Option C claims it always sets the highest possible price. I don't think that's right. Monopolies set prices where marginal revenue equals marginal cost, but the highest price would be where the demand curve starts. They balance demand elasticity to maximize profit, so not necessarily the highest possible.

Option D says it can freely enter and exit the market. Wait, no. Monopolies often have high barriers to entry, which prevent others from entering. But the firm itself can operate freely? Or is it that because it's a single seller, exit might not be as easy? I'm a bit confused here.

Option E: It operates at a loss to prevent new firms. Hmm, that sounds like limit pricing, where a monopoly keeps prices low to deter entry. But I'm not sure if that's always true. I think some monopolies might do that, but it's not a defining characteristic.

Option F: Marginal revenue increases as output sold increases. No, in monopoly, MR is less than price because when you increase output, you have to lower the price for all units. So MR decreases as quantity increases.

Option G: Marginal revenue stays constant regardless of output. That would be the case in perfect competition where firms are price takers, so MR equals price and is constant. Monopolies have decreasing MR as output increases.

Option H: Shares the market with other dominant firms. That's more like an oligopoly, where a few firms dominate the market. Monopoly has only one firm.

Option I: Increases price on all units to maximize profits. Wait, no. Monopolies set a single price for all units (unless price discriminating). If they increase price, they might sell less, but they balance where MR=MC. So it's not about always increasing prices, but finding the optimal point.

Option J: Lowers price on all units to sell more. That sounds like the demand curveâ€”lowering price to increase quantity sold. But in monopoly, since they're the sole seller, they adjust price and quantity based on MR and MC. So this might be correct, but I'm a bit mixed up.

Wait, thinking again. In a monopoly, the firm faces a downward sloping demand curve. So when they increase output, they must lower the price for all units to sell more. So yes, as quantity increases, price decreases. So option J says it correctly: it has to lower its price on all units to sell more output. That makes sense because if they want to sell more, they have to reduce the price.

Let me check the other options again. Option E: operating at a loss. I don't think that's necessarily true. Monopolies can make profits, but sometimes they might lower prices to prevent entry, but that's not a defining feature. So the correct answer is J.

A monopoly is a market structure characterized by a single seller of a unique product with no close substitutes. Analyzing each option:

- **A**: Incorrect. Predatory pricing (setting prices below average variable cost) is not a defining feature of monopoly.
- **B**: Incorrect. Monopoly involves a single firm, not competition with many firms.
- **C**: Incorrect. Monopolies do not always set the highest possible price; they maximize profit where marginal revenue equals marginal cost.
- **D**: Incorrect. High barriers to entry prevent others from entering, but the monopoly itself does not freely enter or exit.
- **E**: Incorrect. While monopolies may sometimes lower prices to deter entry, this is not a universal truth.
- **F**: Incorrect. Marginal revenue decreases as output increases in a monopoly due to the downward-sloping demand curve.
- **G**: Incorrect. Marginal revenue does not stay constant; it decreases with output.
- **H**: Incorrect. This describes oligopoly, not monopoly.
- **I**: Incorrect. Monopolies do not always increase prices; they balance price and quantity to maximize profit.
- **J**: Correct. In a monopoly, to sell more output, the firm must lower the price on all units, as it faces a downward-sloping demand curve.

The correct answer is **J**.
