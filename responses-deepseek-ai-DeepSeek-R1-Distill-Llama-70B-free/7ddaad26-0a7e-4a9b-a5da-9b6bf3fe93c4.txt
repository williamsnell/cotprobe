C: Birds can be found on islands located farther from the mainland than the birds' maximum nonstop flight distance.
D: South American temperate plants are more similar to the tropical plants of South America than to the temperate plants of Europe.

Okay, so I need to answer this question about Darwin and his concept of descent with modification. Hmm, I remember that Darwin's theory was influenced by several observations he made during his travels, especially on the Gal√°pagos Islands. 

The question is asking which observation helped him shape that concept. The options are A through D. Let me go through each one.

Option A: Species diversity declines farther from the equator. I think this is more about biogeography and maybe the latitudinal gradient in species richness. I'm not sure how directly this ties to descent with modification. Descent with modification is about how species change over time, so maybe this isn't the main point.

Option B: Fewer species live on islands than on the nearest continents. Oh, right, Darwin noticed that islands have fewer species. But how does that relate to descent with modification? Maybe it's about the idea that species must have arrived there and then changed, but I'm not certain. I'll keep this in mind but look at the other options.

Option C: Birds can be found on islands located farther from the mainland than the birds' maximum nonstop flight distance. Wait, this seems interesting. If birds can't fly that far, how did they get there? Maybe this suggests that they evolved from ancestors that could, or that they were carried there somehow. Or perhaps it's about how species can disperse and then adapt. I think this could relate to the idea that species change and adapt to their environments, so this might support descent with modification.

Option D: South American temperate plants are more similar to the tropical plants of South America than to the temperate plants of Europe. Oh, I remember this! Darwin observed that plants in the same climate but different continents aren't as similar as those in the same continent but different climates. This would suggest that they evolved from common ancestors in the same region, which ties into descent with modification. So this observation would support the idea that species change over time based on their lineage rather than just the environment.

Wait, but I think the key here is that similar environments don't necessarily have similar species. So the fact that South American temperate plants are more like their tropical counterparts in the same continent rather than European temperate ones implies that they share a recent ancestor, hence descent with modification.

So which option is correct? The question is about which observation helped shape the concept. I think option D is the right one because it points to a pattern that suggests a common ancestry rather than environmental factors determining species similarity.

Alternatively, option C is about the distribution of birds, which might relate to how species can colonize new areas and then change. But I think D is a stronger example because it's about the similarity of species in the same region, which more directly points to evolution from common ancestors.

So I'm leaning towards option D as the correct answer.

The observation that helped Darwin shape his concept of descent with modification is that South American temperate plants are more similar to the tropical plants of South America than to the temperate plants of Europe. This suggests that species evolve from common ancestors in the same region rather than being determined by environmental factors, directly supporting the idea of descent with modification.

Answer: D
