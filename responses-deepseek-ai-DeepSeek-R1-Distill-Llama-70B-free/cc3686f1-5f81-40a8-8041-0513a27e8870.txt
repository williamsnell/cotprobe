Okay, so I have this question here: "As of 2017, what percentage of Americans live in urban areas?" And I need to choose the correct answer from options A to J. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure about the exact percentage, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that urbanization has been increasing over the years. So, probably a majority of Americans live in urban areas. Let me think about what I've heard before. I think it's somewhere around 80-85%, but I'm not certain. Wait, no, that might be too high. Maybe it's a bit lower.

I recall that in the past, like in the mid-20th century, a significant portion of the population lived in rural areas, but with urbanization trends, that number has decreased. So by 2017, I think it's more than 75%, maybe around 80% or so.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Sometimes the numbers can vary based on how "urban" is defined. The U.S. Census Bureau has specific criteria for what qualifies as an urban area, which includes cities and surrounding suburbs. So, maybe the percentage is a bit lower than I initially thought.

I remember reading that around 2010, approximately 81% of Americans lived in urban areas. If that's the case, by 2017, maybe it increased a little. But let's see the options. The options are A:75, B:52, C:42, D:72, E:62, F:95, G:70, H:82, I:92, J:85.

Wait, if the 2010 figure was around 81%, then 2017 would be a few years later, so perhaps it's similar or slightly higher. So looking at the options, H is 82%, which is close to 81%. Alternatively, J is 85%, which is a bit higher. So which one is it?

Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing this up with another country. Let me think again. I think the U.S. has a high urban population, but not as high as some other developed countries. Wait, no, the U.S. is quite urbanized. So 85% seems plausible. But I'm not 100% sure.

Another angle: I remember that in 2016, the World Bank reported that about 82% of Americans lived in urban areas. So if that's the case, by 2017, it might be around the same or a bit higher. So H is 82%, which would fit.

But wait, sometimes the sources might differ. For example, the U.S. Census Bureau's data might have slightly different numbers. Let me try to recall any specific facts. I think in the 2010 Census, the urban population was about 81%, and since urbanization is a gradual process, the number would have increased a bit by 2017. So maybe it's around 82-83%, so 82% would be the correct answer, which is option H.

Alternatively, I might be confusing the U.S. with another country where the urban population is higher, like 85%. But I think the correct figure for the U.S. is around 82%, so H is the answer.

The correct answer is H: 82%.
