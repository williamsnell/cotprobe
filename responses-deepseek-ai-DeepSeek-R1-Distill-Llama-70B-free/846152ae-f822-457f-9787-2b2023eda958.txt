Okay, so I've got this problem where I need to multiply two polynomials in Z_8[x]. The polynomials are f(x) = 4x -5 and g(x) = 2x² -4x +2. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my ring theory, but let me think this through.

First, I remember that Z_8 means the integers modulo 8. So all the coefficients in the polynomials will be considered under modulo 8 arithmetic. That means after each multiplication or addition, I should take the result modulo 8.

So the task is to compute f(x) multiplied by g(x), which is (4x -5) * (2x² -4x +2). Let me write this out step by step.

Let me distribute each term in f(x) across each term in g(x). 

Starting with the first term: 4x multiplied by each term in g(x).
4x * 2x² = 8x³. But wait, 8 mod 8 is 0, so that term becomes 0.
4x * (-4x) = -16x². Oh, but in mod 8, -16 is 0 because 16 is divisible by 8. So that's another 0.
4x * 2 = 8x. Again, 8 mod 8 is 0. So all terms from 4x multiplied into g(x) result in 0. That's unexpected. Did I do that right? Wait, let me double-check. 4x times 2x² is indeed 8x³, which is 0 mod 8. 4x times -4x is -16x², which is 0 mod 8. 4x times 2 is 8x, which is 0 mod 8. So yeah, all these terms vanish. 

Now the second part of f(x) is -5. I'll multiply -5 by each term in g(x).
-5 * 2x² = -10x². What's -10 mod 8? Let's see, 8*1=8, so 8 goes into 10 once with a remainder of 2. So -10 is -2 mod 8, but since mod 8 is positive, adding 8 gives 6. So -10x² mod8 is 6x².
-5 * (-4x) = 20x. 20 divided by 8 is 2 with remainder 4, so 20 mod8 is 4. So 20x becomes 4x.
-5 * 2 = -10. Again, -10 mod8 is 6, as above.

So putting it all together, the product is the sum of all these terms. Wait, but the terms from 4x all became zero, so the only contributions are from -5 multiplied in.

So the product is 6x² +4x +6. Let me check the coefficients again.

Wait, wait, I think I might have made a mistake. Because when I distribute, each term is added together. Let me re-examine the multiplication.

Wait, no, no. Because f(x) is 4x -5, so when multiplied by g(x), each term is multiplied by each term. So 4x times 2x² is 8x³ → 0. 4x times -4x is -16x² → 0. 4x times 2 is 8x → 0. Then -5 times 2x² is -10x² → which is 6x² mod8. -5 times -4x is 20x → which is 4x mod8. -5 times 2 is -10 → which is 6 mod8. So the product is 6x² +4x +6.

Wait, looking at the options, option F is 6x² +4x +6. So that's what I get.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me compute each term again.

Compute (4x -5)(2x² -4x +2):

Multiply each term:

4x * 2x² = 8x³ → 0 mod8
4x * (-4x) = -16x² → 0 mod8
4x * 2 = 8x → 0 mod8
-5 * 2x² = -10x² → -10 mod8 is (-10 + 16)=6 → 6x²
-5*(-4x)=20x → 20 mod8 is 4 → 4x
-5 *2 = -10 → -10 mod8 is 6.

So the product is 6x² +4x +6.

Looking at the options, that's option F.

To find the product of the polynomials \( f(x) = 4x - 5 \) and \( g(x) = 2x^2 - 4x + 2 \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_8[x] \), we perform polynomial multiplication and reduce all coefficients modulo 8.

1. **Multiply \( 4x \) by each term in \( g(x) \):**
   - \( 4x \cdot 2x^2 = 8x^3 \), and \( 8 \equiv 0 \mod 8 \), so this term is \( 0 \).
   - \( 4x \cdot (-4x) = -16x^2 \), and \( -16 \equiv 0 \mod 8 \), so this term is \( 0 \).
   - \( 4x \cdot 2 = 8x \), and \( 8 \equiv 0 \mod 8 \), so this term is \( 0 \).

2. **Multiply \( -5 \) by each term in \( g(x) \):**
   - \( -5 \cdot 2x^2 = -10x^2 \), and \( -10 \equiv 6 \mod 8 \), so this term is \( 6x^2 \).
   - \( -5 \cdot (-4x) = 20x \), and \( 20 \equiv 4 \mod 8 \), so this term is \( 4x \).
   - \( -5 \cdot 2 = -10 \), and \( -10 \equiv 6 \mod 8 \), so this term is \( 6 \).

3. **Combine all terms:**
   - The terms from \( 4x \cdot g(x) \) are all \( 0 \).
   - The terms from \( -5 \cdot g(x) \) are \( 6x^2 + 4x + 6 \).

Thus, the product is \( 6x^2 + 4x + 6 \).

From the given options, the correct answer is **F: \( 6x^2 + 4x + 6 \)**.
