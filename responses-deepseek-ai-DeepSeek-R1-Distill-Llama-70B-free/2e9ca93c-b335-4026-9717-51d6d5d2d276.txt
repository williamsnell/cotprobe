Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about CF4, which is used as a refrigerant called Freon-14. The normal boiling point is -127.8°C, and the heat of vaporization is 12.62 kJ/mol. The question is asking at what pressure we should pump liquid Freon-14 to set a temperature of -135°C. The options are from A to J, each with different pressures in atm.

Hmm, so I remember that when a substance is at its boiling point, the vapor pressure equals the atmospheric pressure. But here, we're dealing with a temperature lower than the normal boiling point, so we're below the normal boiling point. That probably means the vapor pressure will be lower than 1 atm since lower temperatures correspond to lower vapor pressures.

Wait, right, the Clausius-Clapeyron equation might be useful here. It relates the vapor pressure of a liquid to the temperature. The equation is ln(P2/P1) = (ΔHvap/R)(1/T1 - 1/T2), where P1 and P2 are the pressures at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively. ΔHvap is the heat of vaporization, R is the gas constant.

So in this case, the normal boiling point is T1 = -127.8°C, which I need to convert to Kelvin. Oh wait, to convert Celsius to Kelvin, I add 273.15. So T1 = 273.15 - 127.8 = let me calculate that. 273.15 minus 127.8 is 145.35 K. Wait, wait, no. Wait, no, wait a second. Wait, no, the normal boiling point is the temperature at which the vapor pressure is 1 atm. So at T1 = -127.8°C, P1 is 1 atm. Now, we want to find the pressure P2 when the temperature T2 is -135°C.

So first, convert both temperatures to Kelvin. T1 is -127.8 + 273.15. Let me compute that. 273.15 minus 127.8. Let's see, 273 minus 127 is 146, but more accurately, 127.8 from 273.15. So 273.15 - 127.8 = 145.35 K. And T2 is -135 + 273.15 = 138.15 K.

Wait, wait, wait, no! Wait, wait. Wait, the temperature we're setting is lower than the normal boiling point. So the new temperature T2 is -135°C, which is colder than the normal boiling point. So T2 is lower, so the vapor pressure P2 should be lower than 1 atm.

So using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:

ln(P2 / P1) = (ΔHvap / R) [ (1 / T1) - (1 / T2) ]

Wait, wait, the equation is ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH/R)(1/T1 - 1/T2) * (-1)? Or am I mixing up the order?

Wait, the correct form is ln(P2/P1) = (ΔHvap/R)(1/T1 - 1/T2) divided by something? Let me think. Oh, no, the correct equation is:

ln(P2/P1) = -(ΔHvap/R)(1/T2 - 1/T1) ) / (1), assuming ΔHvap is positive (since it's heat of vaporization). Let me make sure. The Clausius-Clapeyron equation is usually written as ln(P2/P1) = (ΔHvap/R)(1/T1 - 1/T2) / 1.

Wait, another version I've seen is ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH/R)(1/T1 - 1/T2) * (1/ΔH? No, no. Wait, the equation is ln(P2/P1) = [ -ΔHvap/R ] (1/T2 - 1/T1). Because when T2 > T1, P2 > P1, so if you increase T, P increases. Let me see, so if T2 is higher than T1, then 1/T2 is less than 1/T1, so 1/T2 - 1/T1 is negative. Multiply by -ΔHvap/R, which is negative (since ΔHvap is positive), so the product would be positive. So ln(P2/P1) would be positive, meaning P2 > P1, which makes sense because higher temperature leads to higher vapor pressure.

In our case, T2 is lower than T1, so 1/T2 is larger than 1/T1. So 1/T2 - 1/T1 is positive. Multiply by -ΔHvap/R, which is negative. So ln(P2/P1) is negative, so P2 < P1.

So the equation setup should be correct.

So let me plug in the values.

P1 is 1 atm (since at the normal boiling point, the vapor pressure equals 1 atm).

T1 is 145.35 K.

T2 is 138.15 K.

ΔHvap is 12.62 kJ/mol. Oh wait, the gas constant R is usually 8.314 J/mol·K, but since ΔH is in kJ, I can convert it to J by multiplying by 1e3. So ΔHvap = 12620 J/mol.

So plugging into the equation:

ln(P2 / 1) = (12620 J/mol) / (8.314 J/mol·K) ) * (1/145.35 - 1/138.15 )

Wait, 1/145.35 is approximately 0.00688 K^-1, and 1/138.15 is approximately 0.00724 K^-1.

Wait, wait, let me compute 1/145.35 = approx 0.00688.

1/138.15 = approx 0.00724.

So 1/T1 - 1/T2 = 0.00688 - 0.00724 = -0.00036.

Wait, no, wait: 1/145.35 is 0.00688, 1/138.15 is 0.00724. So 0.00688 minus 0.00724 = -0.00036.

So the term in the parenthesis is negative.

So the equation becomes:

ln(P2) = (12620 / 8.314) * (-0.00036) 

Let me compute 12620 / 8.314 first.

Hmm, 8.314 times 1500 is about 12471, because 8 * 1500 = 12000, 0.314 *1500=471, so 12471. So 12620 is about 149 higher than 12471. So 1500 + (149 / 8.314).

Wait, perhaps better to compute 12620 / 8.314.

Let me compute this step by step:

8.314 * 1517 = ?

Wait, perhaps I can compute 8.314 * 1517.

Wait, perhaps I can approximate 12620 divided by 8.314.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute 12620 / 8.314 = approximately 1517. Let's say approximately 1517 J/(mol·K) * K? Wait, no, the units: ΔH is in J/mol, R is J/mol·K, so ΔH/R has units K.

Wait, no, ΔH/R is (J/mol) / (J/mol·K) )= K.

So (12620 J/mol) / (8.314 J/mol·K) ) ≈ 1517 K.

Wait, no, wait, 8.314 * 1517 = let's see, 8 * 1517 = 12136, 0.314 *1517 ≈ 476, so total ≈ 12136 + 476 = 12612. That's close to 12620, so approximately 1517 K.

So (ΔH/R) is about 1517 K.

Now, multiply by (1/T1 - 1/T2) which is (0.00688 - 0.00724) = -0.00036.

So 1517 K * (-0.00036 K^-1) = 1517 * (-0.00036) = let's compute 1517 * 0.00036.

1517 * 0.00036: 1500 *0.00036 = 0.54, 17 *0.00036=0.00612, so total 0.54612. But since it's multiplied by -1, it's -0.54612.

So ln(P2) ≈ -0.54612.

So to find P2, we take e^(-0.54612) = ?

e^(-0.5) is about 0.6065, e^(-0.6) is about 0.5488. Wait, 0.546 is between 0.5 and 0.6.

Let me compute e^-0.546:

We can use a calculator-like approach. Let's see, 0.546 is approximately 0.5 + 0.046.

We know that e^-0.5 ≈ 0.6065.

Compute the Taylor expansion around 0.5:

e^(-0.5 - 0.046) = e^-0.5 * e^-0.046.

e^-0.046 can be approximated as 1 - 0.046 + (0.046^2)/2 - (0.046^3)/6.

0.046^2 = 0.002116 → 0.002116/2 = 0.001058.

0.046^3 ≈ 0.0000979 → 0.0000979/6 ≈ 0.0000163.

So e^-0.046 ≈ 1 - 0.046 + 0.001058 - 0.0000163 ≈ 0.9550417.

So e^-0.546 = e^-0.5 * e^-0.046 ≈ 0.6065 * 0.9550417 ≈ let's compute that.

0.6065 * 0.95 = 0.5762.

0.6065 * 0.0050417 ≈ approx 0.003057.

So total approx 0.5762 + 0.003057 = 0.57926.

Wait, but that's an approximation. Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use a calculator function, but since I don't have one, I'll proceed.

So P2 ≈ e^-0.546 ≈ 0.58 approximately.

Wait, wait, another approach: I remember that ln(0.58) is approximately what? Let me think. ln(0.5) is about -0.693, ln(0.6) is about -0.5108.

Wait, wait, no, wait: ln(0.6) is about -0.5108, ln(0.58) would be a bit lower than that.

Wait, let me think: e^-0.5 is 0.6065, as I said before. So if I have e^-0.546, which is lower than e^-0.5, which is 0.6065. So e^-0.546 is lower than 0.6065, so perhaps around 0.58.

Wait, let me try a better approach. Let me calculate ln(0.58):

Wait, no, I'm trying to find P2 where ln(P2) is -0.546. So P2 = e^-0.546.

Alternatively, perhaps using logarithm tables or known values.

But perhaps I should just proceed with the approximate value I got, which is around 0.58 atm.

Looking at the options, option G is 0.58 atm. Hmm, so that's one of the choices.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake in the steps.

Let me recompute the 1/T1 and 1/T2.

T1 is 145.35 K.

1/145.35 = approximately 0.00688 K^-1.

T2 is 138.15 K.

1/138.15 ≈ 0.00724 K^-1.

So (1/T1 - 1/T2) = 0.00688 - 0.00724 = -0.00036 K^-1.

ΔHvap is 12620 J/mol.

R is 8.314 J/mol·K.

So (ΔHvap/R) = 12620 / 8.314 ≈ 1517 K.

So (ΔH/R)(1/T1 -1/T2) = 1517 * (-0.00036) ≈ -0.546.

So ln(P2) = -0.546 → P2 ≈ e^-0.546 ≈ 0.58.

So the correct pressure should be approximately 0.58 atm. Looking at the options, option G is 0.58 atm.

Wait, but let me check the options again to make sure. The options are:

A: 1.20 atm

B: 0.65 atm

C: 0.45 atm

D: 0.75 atm

E: 0.85 atm

F: 0.30 atm

G: 0.58 atm

H: 1.50 atm

I: 0.90 atm

J: 1.00 atm

So yes, G is 0.58 atm. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute 1/145.35 and 1/138.15 more accurately.

Let me compute 1/145.35:

145.35 × 0.00688 = let's see, 145 × 0.00688 = approx 1 (since 0.00688 * 145 ≈ 1). So 1/145.35 = approx 0.00688.

1/138.15: 138 × 0.00724 ≈ 1. So 1/138.15 ≈ 0.00724.

So 0.00688 - 0.00724 = -0.00036. That seems correct.

Then, ΔHvap is 12.62 kJ/mol, which is 12620 J/mol. Dividing by R=8.314 gives 12620 / 8.314 ≈ 1517 K.

So 1517 * (-0.00036) = -0.54612.

So ln(P2) = -0.54612 → P2 = e^-0.54612.

I think this is correct. So the answer is G: 0.58 atm.

To determine the pressure at which liquid Freon-14 (CF₄) should be pumped to achieve a temperature of -135°C, we use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right) = \frac{\Delta H_{\text{vap}}}{R} \left(\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2}\right)
\]

### Step 1: Identify known values
- **Normal boiling point**: \( T_1 = -127.8^\circ\text{C} \), which converts to \( T_1 = 145.35 \, \text{K} \) (using \( T_{\text{K}} = T_{\text{C}} + 273.15 \)).
- **Target temperature**: \( T_2 = -135^\circ\text{C} \), which converts to \( T_2 = 138.15 \, \text{K} \).
- **Heat of vaporization**: \( \Delta H_{\text{vap}} = 12.62 \, \text{kJ/mol} = 12620 \, \text{J/mol} \).
- **Gas constant**: \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/mol·K} \).
- **Pressure at \( T_1 \)**: \( P_1 = 1 \, \text{atm} \) (normal boiling point).

### Step 2: Plug values into the equation
First, calculate \( \frac{1}{T_1} \) and \( \frac{1}{T_2} \):
\[
\frac{1}{T_1} = \frac{1}{145.35} \approx 0.00688 \, \text{K}^{-1}, \quad \frac{1}{T_2} = \frac{1}{138.15} \approx 0.00724 \, \text{K}^{-1}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{T_1} - \frac{1}{T_2} = 0.00688 - 0.00724 = -0.00036 \, \text{K}^{-1}
\]

Next, calculate \( \frac{\Delta H_{\text{vap}}}{R} \):
\[
\frac{\Delta H_{\text{vap}}}{R} = \frac{12620}{8.314} \approx 1517 \, \text{K}
\]

Now substitute into the equation:
\[
\ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right) = 1517 \cdot (-0.00036) \approx -0.546
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( P_2 \)
Since \( P_1 = 1 \, \text{atm} \), the equation simplifies to:
\[
\ln(P_2) = -0.546
\]
\[
P_2 = e^{-0.546} \approx 0.58 \, \text{atm}
\]

### Step 4: Match with options
From the given options, the closest value to \( 0.58 \, \text{atm} \) is **G: 0.58 atm**.

ANSWER: G
