Okay, so I have this question about the force with which the Earth attracts the Moon. The options are from A to J, each with different values in dynes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my physics, but let's think this through.

I remember that the gravitational force between two masses is given by Newton's law of universal gravitation. The formula is F = G * (M * m) / r², where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the Earth, m is the mass of the Moon, and r is the distance between them.

Wait, what's the gravitational constant G? I think it's 6.67 × 10^-11 N·m²/kg². Yeah, that sounds right. But wait, the question is in dynes, not newtons. Oh right, 1 newton is 10^5 dynes. So I'll have to convert units later.

Now, the mass of the Earth. I remember it's approximately 5.97 × 10^24 kg. And the Moon's mass is about 7.35 × 10^22 kg. The average distance from Earth to Moon is about 3.84 × 10^8 meters, right? But sometimes people use 4 × 10^8 for simplicity, but I'll go with the exact value if I can.

Let me plug these values into the formula. F = (6.67e-11) * (5.97e24 kg) * (7.35e22 kg) / (3.84e8 m)^2.

Wait, wait, let me calculate the numerator and denominator step by step.

First, calculate the product of the masses: 5.97e24 * 7.35e22. Let me multiply the coefficients: 5.97 * 7.35 is approximately... let's see, 5*7 is 35, 5*0.35 is 1.75, 0.97*7 is ~6.8, 0.97*0.35 is ~0.3395. Adding all together: 35 + 1.75 + 6.8 + 0.3395 ≈ 43.8895. So approximately 43.89, and then exponents: 10^24 *10^22 = 10^46. So numerator is 43.89e46 kg².

Wait, but wait, actually, when you multiply 5.97e24 by 7.35e22, you add the exponents: 24 +22 =46. So 5.97 *7.35 is about 43.8, so 43.8e46, which is 4.38e47.

Wait, 5.97 *7.35: perhaps a more accurate calculation. 5 *7 is 35, 5 *0.35 is 1.75, 0.97 *7 is 6.79, 0.97 *0.35 is 0.3395. So adding up 35 +1.75 is 36.75, plus 6.79 is 43.54, plus 0.3395 is ~43.8795. So 43.88e46, which is 4.388e47 kg².

Now, multiply by G: 6.67e-11 N·m²/kg² * 4.388e47 kg². The units kg² cancel, and we have N·m². So 6.67e-11 *4.388e47 = let's calculate that.

6.67 *4.388 is approximately... 6*4 is 24, 6*0.388 is ~2.328, 0.67*4 is 2.68, 0.67*0.388≈0.259. Adding these: 24 +2.328 =26.328 +2.68=28. +0.259≈28.259. So 28.259e( -11 +47 ) =28.259e36. But wait, 6.67e-11 *4.388e47 is 6.67*4.388 = approx 29.23, and 10^(-11+47) = 10^36. So 29.23e36 N·m².

Wait, but wait, the denominator is r squared. Oh right, I forgot that part. So the denominator is (3.84e8)^2. Let's compute that.

3.84e8 squared: (3.84)^2 is about 14.7456, and (10^8)^2 is 10^16. So denominator is 14.7456e16 m², which is 1.47456e17 m².

So now, F = (29.23e36 N·m²) / (1.47456e17 m²) = (29.23 / 1.47456) e^(36-17) N. Calculating 29.23 /1.47456 ≈ let's see: 1.47456 *20 is 29.4912, which is just a bit higher than 29.23. So 29.23 /1.47456 ≈ approx 19.8. So F ≈19.8e19 N.

Wait, 19.8e19 N. But wait, 29.23 / 1.47456= 19.8? Let me do it more accurately. 1.47456 ×19.8 = ?

1.47456 * 20 =29.4912. Subtract 1.47456 *0.2=0.294912. So 29.4912 -0.294912 =29.196288. So 1.47456 *19.8 ≈29.196, which is slightly less than 29.23. So perhaps 19.8 + (0.034/1.47456) ≈19.8 +0.023≈19.823. So F ≈19.823e19 N.

So F is approximately 1.9823e20 N. Wait, 19.823e19 is the same as 1.9823e20.

But wait, the question asks for the force in dynes. Oh right, 1 N = 10^5 dynes. So multiply by 1e5.

So 1.9823e20 N *1e5 dynes/N =1.9823e25 dynes.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A: 1.2 ×10^25, B:5e25, C:3e25, D:2e25, etc. Wait, my calculation says ~1.98e25, which is approximately 2e25. Let me check the options.

Option D is 2.0e25. Option J is 2.8e25, which is higher. Wait, so my calculation says ~1.98e25, which is very close to 2.0e25, which is option D.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Let me recalculate the numerator and denominator more accurately. Maybe I approximated too much.

Compute F = G * (M * m) / r².

Given:

G = 6.67430e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻² (exact value is 6.67430e-11)

M_earth = 5.972e24 kg

m_moon = 7.347673e22 kg

r = 3.844e8 meters (average Earth-Moon distance)

So:

M * m = 5.972e24 *7.347673e22 = let's compute this.

5.972 *7.347673 = approx 5.972 *7 =41.804, 5.972 *0.347673≈2.074. So total is about 43.878. So M*m =43.878e46 kg² (since 24+22=46).

Wait, 5.972 *7.347673: let me compute it precisely.

5.972 *7 =41.804

5.972 *0.347673: Let's compute 5.972 *0.3 =1.7916, 5.972 *0.047673≈5.972 *0.04=0.2389, 5.972 *0.007673≈0.0458. So 1.7916 +0.2389=2.0305 +0.0458≈2.0763. So total is 41.804 +2.0763≈43.8803. So M*m=43.8803e46 kg²=4.38803e47 kg².

G*(M*m) =6.6743e-11 *4.38803e47 = Let's compute 6.6743 *4.38803.

6 *4 =24, 6 *0.38803≈2.328, 0.6743 *4≈2.697, 0.6743 *0.38803≈0.2616. So total is approx 24+2.328=26.328 +2.697=29.025 +0.2616≈29.2866. So 6.6743e-11 *4.38803e47 =29.2866e36 (since -11 +47=36) =2.92866e37 N·m².

Wait, no, wait: 6.6743e-11 *4.38803e47 =6.6743 *4.38803 = ~29.286, and exponents: 10^(-11 +47)=10^36. So 29.286e36 =2.9286e37 N·m².

Now, the denominator is r² = (3.844e8)^2.

3.844^2 = approx 14.77, and (1e8)^2=1e16. So 14.77e16 m² =1.477e17 m².

So F = (2.9286e37) / (1.477e17) = (2.9286 /1.477) *1e20.

2.9286 /1.477 = let's compute that. 1.477 *2=2.954, which is just a bit higher than 2.9286. So 1.477 * 1.98 ≈?

Wait, 1.477 *1.98: 1 *1.98=1.98, 0.477 *1.98 → let's compute 0.4 *1.98=0.792, 0.077 *1.98≈0.152. So 0.792 +0.152=0.944. So total is 1.98 +0.944=2.924. Oh wait, that's 1.477 *1.98 =2.924, but our numerator is 2.9286. So 1.477 *1.98 ≈2.924, so 2.9286 is 2.924 +0.0046. So 0.0046 /1.477 ≈0.0031. So total is 1.98 +0.0031 ≈1.9831. So F≈1.9831e20 N.

Now, converting newtons to dynes: 1 N =1e5 dynes. So 1.9831e20 N *1e5 dynes/N =1.9831e25 dynes.

Looking at the options, option D is 2.0e25, which is very close to this value. So the correct answer should be D.

Wait, but another thought: maybe the average distance used in the problem is different. For example, if the question uses 384,000 km (3.84e8 m), which I did. So the calculation should be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check a reference value. I think the gravitational force between Earth and Moon is about 2e20 N, which when converted to dynes is 2e25 dynes, which matches option D. 

So the answer should be D.

To determine the force with which the Earth attracts the Moon, we use Newton's law of universal gravitation:

\[
F = G \cdot \frac{M \cdot m}{r^2}
\]

Where:
- \( G = 6.67430 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{kg}^2 \) (gravitational constant),
- \( M = 5.972 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg} \) (mass of the Earth),
- \( m = 7.347673 \times 10^{22} \, \text{kg} \) (mass of the Moon),
- \( r = 3.844 \times 10^8 \, \text{m} \) (average Earth-Moon distance).

### Step 1: Calculate \( M \cdot m \)
\[
M \cdot m = (5.972 \times 10^{24}) \cdot (7.347673 \times 10^{22}) = 4.38803 \times 10^{47} \, \text{kg}^2
\]

### Step 2: Multiply by \( G \)
\[
G \cdot (M \cdot m) = (6.67430 \times 10^{-11}) \cdot (4.38803 \times 10^{47}) = 2.92866 \times 10^{37} \, \text{N·m}^2
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( r^2 \)
\[
r^2 = (3.844 \times 10^8)^2 = 1.477 \times 10^{17} \, \text{m}^2
\]

### Step 4: Compute \( F \)
\[
F = \frac{2.92866 \times 10^{37}}{1.477 \times 10^{17}} = 1.9831 \times 10^{20} \, \text{N}
\]

### Step 5: Convert to dynes
Since \( 1 \, \text{N} = 10^5 \, \text{dynes} \):
\[
F = 1.9831 \times 10^{20} \cdot 10^5 = 1.9831 \times 10^{25} \, \text{dynes}
\]

### Final Answer
The calculated force is approximately \( 1.9831 \times 10^{25} \, \text{dynes} \), which is closest to option **D: \( 2.0 \times 10^{25} \, \text{dynes} \)**.
