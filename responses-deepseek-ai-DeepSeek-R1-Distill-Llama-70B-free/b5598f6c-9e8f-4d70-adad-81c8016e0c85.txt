Question:

A ten-year-old boy, tested with a paper-and-pencil intelligence test, obtained an IQ score of 130. Two years later, he was tested with an alternate form of the same test. Most likely, the obtained score on the second testing would be

Options:

A: 130, but with a significant decrease in subtest scores
B: more than 130
C: 140, indicating significant intellectual growth
D: 130
E: 130, but with a different pare of subtest scores
F: less than 130
G: 130, but with a significant increase in subtest scores
H: 100, showing a significant drop in intelligence quotient
I: 120, indicating a decrease in intellectual capabilities
J: Unpredictable as the test used was different

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about IQ tests, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is about a ten-year-old boy who took a paper-and-pencil intelligence test and scored an IQ of 130. Then, two years later, he took an alternate form of the same test. The question is asking what his score would most likely be on the second test.

Hmm, I remember that IQ scores are standardized, so they're supposed to reflect a person's standing relative to their peers. I think the average IQ is 100, so 130 is above average. But wait, how does taking the test again after two years affect the score? I'm trying to recall what I learned about IQ tests and their reliability.

I remember something about test-retest reliability, which refers to the consistency of scores when the same test is taken at different times. But wait, this question says they used an alternate form of the test, not the exact same one. Alternate forms are supposed to be equivalent, right? So they should give similar results, assuming the person's intelligence hasn't changed much.

Oh, but wait, the boy is two years older now. Does that affect the IQ score? Because IQ is calculated as (mental age / chronological age) * 100. So when he was 10, his mental age was higher than average. At 12, if his mental age increases proportionally, his IQ should stay about the same. For example, if at 10, his mental age was 13 (because 13/10 *100 =130), then at 12, if his mental age is 15.6 (because 12*1.3=15.6), his IQ would still be 130.

So, his actual mental abilities probably have grown, but so has his chronological age, so the ratio remains the same. Therefore, his IQ score should stay around 130.

Looking at the options, option D is 130. Option C says 140, implying a significant increase, but that's unlikely because the test is standardized, and the alternate form should account for that. Option F says less than 130, but unless something bad happened, his IQ wouldn't drop. Option E says 130 but with different subtest scores—maybe, but the question is about the overall score. Option J says it's unpredictable because the test is different, but alternate forms are designed to be equivalent, so that shouldn't matter.

Wait, but could there be any other factors? Like, the alternate form might have different questions that the boy found easier or harder. Oh, but that's why alternate forms are used—so that the scores remain comparable. Plus, the question says it's the same test, just an alternate form, so the overall reliability should be high.

So, I think the most likely answer is D: 130.

The IQ score is calculated as a ratio of mental age to chronological age, standardized to have a mean of 100. When the same individual takes an alternate form of the test two years later, the expectation is that their IQ score will remain stable, assuming no significant changes in cognitive abilities. The alternate form is designed to be equivalent to the original test, ensuring consistent measurement. Therefore, the boy's IQ score would most likely remain 130.

Answer: D
