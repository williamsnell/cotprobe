Question:

Give a list of the character set used inPL/I. Also define the term'variable', and explain what is meant by an 'assign-ment statement'.

Options:

A: 70 different characters, variable is constant, assignment statement assigns a variable to a value
B: 50 different characters, variable can't vary, assignment statement assigns a variable to a function
C: 85 different characters, variable is a label for a value, assignment statement updates the value of a variable without changing the label
D: 90 different characters, variable is a fixed point in memory, assignment statement creates a new variable
E: 65 different characters, variable holds temporary data, assignment statement links two variables
F: 55 different characters, variable can change type, assignment statement copies a function's output to a variable
G: 75 different characters, variable represents a specific type, assignment statement changes the type of a variable
H: 80 different characters, variable is a function, assignment statement assigns a function to a variable
I: 60 different characters, variable can vary, assignment statement assigns a value to a variable
J: 100 different characters, variable is a placeholder, assignment statement transfers data from one variable to another

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about PL/I programming. Hmm, I need to figure out the right answer. Let's break it down step by step.

The question has three parts: the character set used in PL/I, the definition of a variable, and what an assignment statement does. I remember PL/I is an older programming language, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details.

First, the character set. I think PL/I uses a specific number of characters. I recall that PL/I was designed to be a general-purpose language, so it probably has a decent number of characters, maybe around 60 or so? But I'm not exactly sure. I'll have to wait until I look at the options.

Next, the definition of a variable. I know that in programming, a variable is a name given to a memory location where a value can be stored. So the variable's value can change; it's not fixed. So any option that says a variable can't vary is probably wrong. Like, if a variable can't change, that's more like a constant.

Then, the assignment statement. This is a statement that assigns a value to a variable. So it's like taking a value and putting it into the variable's memory location. So the assignment statement should be something like setting the variable's value.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 70 characters, variable is constant. Wait, that can't be right because variables are supposed to vary. So A is out.

Option B: 50 chars, variable can't vary. No, same problem as A. Variables should vary, so B is wrong.

Option C: 85 chars, variable is a label for a value. Hmm, that makes sense because a variable is a name for a value. The assignment statement here says it updates the value without changing the label. That sounds right because assigning a new value doesn't change the variable's name, just what it points to.

Option D: 90 chars, variable is a fixed point in memory. Well, variables are usually at fixed memory locations, but the assignment statement creating a new variable doesn't fit. Assignment should change the value, not create a new variable.

Option E: 65 chars, holds temp data. Not sure about the 65, but assignment linking variables doesn't sound right. Assignment is about values, not links.

Option F: 55 chars, variable can change type. I'm not sure if PL/I allows variables to change type after declaration. Probably not, as most languages require declared types. So F might be incorrect.

Option G: 75 chars, variable represents a type. Not sure about this. Assignment changing the type doesn't seem right because variables usually have fixed types once declared.

Option H: 80 chars, variable is a function. No, that's not right. Variables aren't functions; they hold values.

Option I: 60 chars, variable can vary. That fits with the definition. Assignment assigns a value to a variable. So this sounds correct.

Option J: 100 chars, variable is a placeholder. That's somewhat correct, but the assignment statement transferring data between variables isn't quite right. Assignment is more about setting a variable to a value, not transferring from another variable necessarily.

Now, I'm a bit stuck between options C and I. Let's think more about the character set. From what I remember, PL/I uses a character set that includes letters, digits, and some symbols. I think it's around 60 characters. So option I says 60, which fits. Option C says 85, which seems high.

So the correct character set is probably 60, which is option I. That leaves us with I as the possible correct answer.

To recap: PL/I uses around 60 characters, variables can vary and hold different values, and assignment statements set a variable to a value. So option I matches all that.

The question asks about three aspects of PL/I: the character set, the definition of a variable, and the purpose of an assignment statement. Here's the analysis:

1. **Character Set**: PL/I uses approximately 60 different characters, which matches option I.

2. **Definition of a Variable**: A variable in programming is a name given to a memory location where a value can be stored, and its value can change. This aligns with option I, which states that a variable "can vary."

3. **Assignment Statement**: An assignment statement assigns a value to a variable, which is accurately described in option I as "assigning a value to a variable."

Other options were eliminated because they either provided incorrect character counts, misrepresented the nature of variables, or described assignment statements inaccurately.

**Answer: I**
