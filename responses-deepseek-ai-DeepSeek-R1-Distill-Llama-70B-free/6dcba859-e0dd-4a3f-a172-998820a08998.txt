Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because equilibrium problems can be tricky. But I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The reaction given is 2 SO₂(g) + O₂(g) ⇌ 2 SO₃(g). The setup is that initially, there are 0.100 moles of SO₂ and 0.100 moles of SO₃ in a 2.00-liter flask at 27°C. At equilibrium, the pressure is 2.78 atm. The questions are a) the mole fraction of O₂ at equilibrium, b) Kp, and c) the percent dissociation of SO₃ under different initial conditions.

Hmm, okay. So for part a, I need to find the mole fraction of O₂. Let's think about this.

First, I should probably set up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) to find the mole amounts at equilibrium. Since the reaction is already at equilibrium, maybe I can find the changes in moles.

Wait, but the initial moles are given as 0.100 SO₂ and 0.100 SO₃. But wait, the reaction as written has SO₂ and O₂ producing SO₃. So initially, there's no O₂. So wait, I think I should set up the ICE table in terms of the reaction.

Let me write it out:

Reaction: 2 SO₂ + O₂ ⇌ 2 SO₃

Initial moles:
SO₂: 0.100 mol
O₂: 0 mol
SO₃: 0.100 mol

But wait, wait. Actually, the reaction starts with some SO₂ and SO₃, but no O₂. So, perhaps the system will adjust to reach equilibrium. Let me think, is the reaction proceeding forward or reverse?

Wait, the reaction can go either way. Let's see. The initial situation is that we have some SO₃ and SO₂. But no O₂. So the reaction will go in the direction that produces O₂ because that's what's missing. So maybe the reaction will proceed in reverse, decomposing some SO₃ into SO₂ and O₂.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe it's better to let the change be represented as x. Let me define the change in terms of the reaction as written. Let's let the change be -x, meaning the reaction proceeds in reverse.

Wait, no, let me think again. Let's let the change be based on the forward reaction. So in the ICE table:

Initial:
SO₂: 0.100
O₂: 0
SO₃: 0.100

Change:
SO₂: -2x
O₂: +x
SO₃: +2x

Wait, no. Because if the forward reaction proceeds (producing more SO₃), that's if the system is not yet at equilibrium. But wait, initially, we have some SO₃. So perhaps the system is beyond the equilibrium point, so the reverse reaction will occur, meaning x will be negative. Hmm, maybe I should represent the change as reverse.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to assume that the system will adjust by producing some O₂. So, let's let the change be that some SO₃ decomposes into SO₂ and O₂. So, perhaps I should represent the change as:

Let x be the amount of SO₃ that decomposes. So:

SO₃: 0.100 - 2x (Wait, no. No. Wait, for each mole of reaction in reverse, 2 moles of SO₃ decompose into 2 moles of SO₂ and 1 mole of O₂. So for each x, 2x moles of SO₃ decompose. So:

Change:
SO₂: +2x
O₂: +x
SO₃: -2x

Wait, yes. So the ICE table would be:

Initial (mol):
SO₂: 0.100
O₂: 0
SO₃: 0.100

Change:
SO₂: +2x
O₂: +x
SO₃: -2x

Equilibrium (mol):
SO₂: 0.100 + 2x
O₂: x
SO₃: 0.100 - 2x

Wait, but wait, the stoichiometry is 2 mol of SO₂ consumed per 1 mol O₂ produced when going forward. So the reverse would be, for each x, 2x SO₂ are produced, 1x O₂, and 2x SO₃ consumed.

Wait, perhaps I should note that the stoichiometric coefficients are 2 for SO₂, 1 for O₂, and 2 for SO₃. So for each mole of reaction in reverse, the changes would be: +2 for SO₂, +1 for O₂, -2 for SO₃.

So the ICE table should reflect that.

Now, the total moles at equilibrium would be:

n_SO2 = 0.100 + 2x
n_O2 = x
n_SO3 = 0.100 - 2x

Wait, but wait. Wait, the initial SO3 is 0.100. If 2x moles decompose, then equilibrium is 0.100 - 2x.

Now, the total pressure can be calculated from the ideal gas law. Wait, but maybe we can calculate the total moles first.

The total moles at equilibrium would be:

n_total = (0.100 + 2x) + x + (0.100 - 2x) = 0.100 + 2x + x + 0.100 - 2x = 0.200 + x

Because 2x and -2x cancel in SO₂ and SO3, leaving x from O2.

So n_total = 0.200 + x.

But the pressure at equilibrium is given as 2.78 atm. The flask volume is 2.00 L, and temperature is 27°C, which is 300 K.

Using the ideal gas law, PV = nRT → n = PV/(RT)

So n_total at equilibrium is (2.78 atm * 2.00 L) / (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K * 300 K)

Let me calculate that.

P = 2.78 atm, V = 2.00 L. R = 0.0821, T = 300 K.

n_total = (2.78 * 2) / (0.0821 * 300) = (5.56) / (24.63) ≈ 0.226 moles.

So n_total ≈ 0.226 = 0.200 + x → x ≈ 0.226 - 0.200 = 0.026 moles.

Wait, that seems manageable. So x is approximately 0.026 mol.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately:

Calculate denominator: 0.0821 * 300 = 24.63.

Numerator: 2.78 * 2 = 5.56.

5.56 / 24.63 = let's see. 24.63 * 0.226 is 24.63 * 0.2 = 4.926. 24.63 * 0.026 = 0.64038. So total 5.56638. So 5.56 is a bit less than that. So 5.56 /24.63 ≈ 0.2258 ≈ 0.226. So yeah, x = 0.026.

So, the moles at equilibrium would be:

SO₂: 0.100 + 2*(0.026) = 0.100 + 0.052 = 0.152 mol

O₂: 0.026 mol

SO3: 0.100 - 2*(0.026) = 0.100 - 0.052 = 0.048 mol

Now, to find the mole fraction of O₂. The mole fraction is (moles of O₂) / (total moles).

Total moles is 0.226 as computed before.

Mole fraction of O₂ = 0.026 / 0.226 ≈ 0.115.

Hmm, looking at the options, option G is a) 0.115, which matches. Let me note that.

So that's part a) done, and the answer is 0.115, which is option G's a).

Now, part b) is Kp. So Kp is calculated using partial pressures.

But to find Kp, we need the partial pressures of each gas at equilibrium.

The partial pressure of each gas is (mole fraction) * total pressure.

Total pressure is 2.78 atm.

So:

P_SO2 = (0.152 / 0.226) * 2.78 atm

P_O2 = (0.026 / 0.226) * 2.78

P_SO3 = (0.048 / 0.226) * 2.78

Alternatively, since the mole fractions are (n_i / n_total), and the partial pressure is (n_i RT / V) which is (n_i / n_total) * P_total.

So let me compute each partial pressure:

P_SO2 = (0.152 / 0.226) * 2.78

= (0.672) * 2.78 ≈ 1.868 atm

Wait, 0.152 /0.226 = approximately 0.673. 0.673 * 2.78 ≈ let's compute:

2.78 * 0.6 = 1.668

2.78 * 0.073 = 0.202

So sum is ~1.87 atm.

Similarly, P_O2 is (0.026 / 0.226)*2.78 ≈ (0.115) * 2.78 ≈ 0.319 atm.

Wait, 0.026/0.226 = 0.115. 0.115 * 2.78 is approximately 0.319 atm.

P_SO3 is (0.048 / 0.226)*2.78 ≈ (0.212) * 2.78 ≈ 0.589 atm.

Wait, let me calculate more accurately:

0.048 / 0.226 = 0.2123.

0.2123 * 2.78 = 0.589 atm.

Now, the reaction is 2 SO₂ + O₂ ⇌ 2 SO₃.

So Kp = [ (P_SO3)^2 ] / [ (P_SO2)^2 * (P_O2) ]

Plugging in the values:

P_SO3^2 = (0.589)^2 ≈ 0.3468

P_SO2^2 = (1.868)^2 ≈ 3.489

P_O2 = 0.319

So Kp = 0.3468 / (3.489 * 0.319) = 0.3468 / (1.1137) ≈ 0.311.

Looking at the options, option G has b) 0.31, which matches. So Kp is approximately 0.31, so part b's answer is 0.31, which is option G.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the partial pressures. Let me recalculate each partial pressure more accurately.

n_total is 0.226.

For SO₂: 0.152 / 0.226 = 0.672.

0.672 * 2.78 atm = let's compute 2.78 * 0.672.

2.78 * 0.6 = 1.668

2.78 * 0.072 = 0.200 (approx), so total ≈ 1.868 atm.

O₂: 0.026 / 0.226 = 0.115.

0.115 * 2.78 = 0.319 atm.

SO3: 0.048 / 0.226 = 0.2123.

0.2123 * 2.78 = let's compute 2.78 * 0.2 = 0.556, 2.78 * 0.0123= 0.0342, so total 0.5902 atm.

So SO3 partial pressure is ~0.590 atm.

Now, Kp = (0.590)^2 / ( (1.868)^2 * 0.319 )

Calculate numerator: 0.590^2 = 0.3481.

Denominator: (1.868^2) * 0.319.

1.868^2: Let's compute 1.8^2 = 3.24, 0.068^2 = 0.0046, but perhaps better to compute it as 1.868 * 1.868.

1.868 * 1.8 = 3.3624, 1.868 * 0.068 = approx 0.127. So total 3.3624 + 0.127 = 3.4894.

So denominator is 3.4894 * 0.319 = let's compute 3 * 0.319 = 0.957, 0.4894 * 0.319 ≈ 0.156. So total ≈ 1.113.

So Kp = 0.3481 / 1.113 ≈ 0.3125.

Which is approximately 0.31, which is option G's b).

So part b is 0.31.

Now, part c) asks for the percent dissociation of SO3 if initially 0.100 mole of SO3 and no O2 and no SO2 are present in the flask.

Wait, so the initial moles are 0.100 mol SO3, 0 SO2, 0 O2, in the same 2.00 L flask at 27°C.

Wait, so the reaction will proceed in the reverse direction, decomposing SO3 into SO2 and O2.

Let me define the change. Let me let the extent of reaction be y, where y is the amount of SO3 that decomposes.

So the reaction is:

2 SO3 → 2 SO2 + O2 (since it's the reverse of the given reaction)

Wait, no. Wait, the original reaction is 2 SO2 + O2 → 2 SO3. So the reverse would be 2 SO3 → 2 SO2 + O2.

So for every 2 moles of SO3 that decompose, we get 2 moles of SO2 and 1 mole of O2.

So the ICE table would be:

Initial (mol):
SO3: 0.100
SO2: 0
O2: 0

Change:
SO3: -2y
SO2: +2y
O2: +y

Equilibrium (mol):
SO3: 0.100 - 2y
SO2: 0 + 2y
O2: 0 + y

So the total moles at equilibrium would be:

n_total = (0.100 - 2y) + 2y + y = 0.100 + y.

Because 2y from SO2, y from O2, and (0.100 - 2y) from SO3.

Wait, because (0.100 - 2y) + 2y + y = 0.100 + y.

But wait, I think I made a mistake here. Let me recount:

(0.100 - 2y) [SO3] + 2y [SO2] + y [O2] = 0.100 - 2y + 2y + y = 0.100 + y.

Yes, correct.

The pressure at equilibrium can be found using the ideal gas law again.

Wait, but wait. Wait, what's the pressure in this scenario? Because the initial pressure would be lower, and the system would adjust.

Wait, but in this case, we don't have the final pressure given, so perhaps we need to express Kp in terms of y and solve for y.

Wait, Kp was found in part b) as approximately 0.31. So Kp = 0.31.

Wait, the reaction for part c) is the reverse of the original reaction. So the K for the decomposition of SO3 would be 1/Kp_original.

Wait, no. Let me think. The original reaction is 2 SO2 + O2 ⇌ 2 SO3, Kp = 0.31.

The reverse reaction, which is 2 SO3 ⇌ 2 SO2 + O2, would have Kp_reverse = 1/Kp = 1/0.31 ≈ 3.2258.

So Kp for the decomposition is 3.2258.

So for the reaction 2 SO3 ⇌ 2 SO2 + O2, Kp = 3.2258.

Now, let's express the partial pressures in terms of y.

The total pressure isn't given, so maybe we can find it using the ideal gas law.

Wait, the moles at equilibrium are (0.100 + y), as we had earlier.

So the total pressure P can be calculated as n_total * R T / V.

n_total = 0.100 + y.

R is 0.0821, T is 300 K, V is 2.00 L.

So P = (0.100 + y) * (0.0821) * 300 / 2.00.

Compute that:

0.0821 * 300 = 24.63.

24.63 / 2.00 = 12.315.

So P = 12.315 * (0.100 + y).

Now, the partial pressures are:

P_SO3 = (0.100 - 2y) / (0.100 + y) * P

P_SO2 = (2y) / (0.100 + y) * P

P_O2 = (y) / (0.100 + y) * P

Wait, no. Because partial pressure is (moles of i) * R T / V. Alternatively, mole fraction is (n_i)/(n_total), so P_i = X_i * P_total.

Yes, so:

P_SO3 = (0.100 - 2y) / (0.100 + y) * P_total

Similarly for others.

Now, the Kp expression for the decomposition reaction is:

Kp = [ (P_SO2)^2 * (P_O2) ] / [ (P_SO3)^2 ]

So:

3.2258 = [ ( (2y/(0.100 + y)) * P )^2 * ( (y/(0.100 + y)) * P ) ) ] / [ ( ( (0.100 - 2y)/(0.100 + y) ) * P )^2 ]

Hmm, that's a bit complicated. Let's see if we can simplify.

But perhaps substituting P = 12.315*(0.100 + y) would help.

Wait, let's substitute P as 12.315*(0.100 + y
