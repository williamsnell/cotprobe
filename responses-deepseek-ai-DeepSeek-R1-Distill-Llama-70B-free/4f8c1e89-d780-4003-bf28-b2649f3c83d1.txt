Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Mitchell et al.'s (1997) theory on stakeholder attributes. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question has three blanks and asks about the factors that determine stakeholder something. From what I remember, Mitchell et al. proposed that stakeholders have certain attributes which determine their salience to the organization. I think the three main attributes are power, legitimacy, and urgency. 

So the question structure is: the first blank is about the stakeholder's ability to influence, which I think is power. The second blank is whether the organization sees the stakeholder's actions as desirable, which relates to legitimacy. The third is about how immediate the attention is needed, which should be urgency. 

Putting it together, the blanks would be filled as power, legitimacy, urgency. And these factors determine stakeholder salience. So the last part of the sentence is about salience.

Now, looking at the options, I need to find the one that aligns with this order. Let's look at each option:

Option A: Salience, Power, Urgency, Legitimacy. Wait, no, because the first blank is power, not salience. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Legitimacy, Urgency, Salience, Power. No, the first blank should be power, not legitimacy.

Option C: Power, Legitimacy, Urgency, Salience. This looks right. The first three blanks are power, legitimacy, urgency, and the last is salience. So the sentence would read: the perceived ability (power) whether the organization perceives (legitimacy), and the immediacy (urgency), determine stakeholder salience.

Let me double-check the other options. Option F is Salience, Urgency, Power, Legitimacy. No, that doesn't fit because the first blank is about power, not salience. Option E starts with Salience, which is wrong. Option H starts with Power, but the last term is Urgency, which doesn't fit because the last part should be salience. 

So the correct option should be C: Power, Legitimacy, Urgency, Salience.

The question refers to Mitchell et al.'s (1997) theory, which identifies three key attributes of stakeholders: power, legitimacy, and urgency. These attributes determine the salience of a stakeholder to an organization. 

1. **Power** refers to the stakeholder's ability to influence organizational actions.
2. **Legitimacy** pertains to whether the organization views the stakeholder's actions as desirable and appropriate.
3. **Urgency** relates to the immediacy of attention the stakeholder demands.

The correct sequence of these attributes, followed by the term they determine (salience), is found in Option C: Power, Legitimacy, Urgency, Salience.

Answer: C
