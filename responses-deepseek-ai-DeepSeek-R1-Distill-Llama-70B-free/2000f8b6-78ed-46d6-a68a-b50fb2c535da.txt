Okay, so I've got this question about AM signals and percentage modulation. Hmm, I remember that AM stands for Amplitude Modulation. The question is about finding the percentage modulation when the antenna current changes from unmodulated to modulated.

Wait, I think percentage modulation relates to how much the amplitude of the carrier wave varies. Right, the formula for percentage modulation is (modulation index) times 100. Oh wait, the modulation index is the ratio of the modulated component to the unmodulated. Or was it the other way around?

Wait, no, I think the formula is: percentage modulation = [(I_max - I_min)/(2*I_unmodulated)] * 100%. Or wait, perhaps it's (I_max - I_min) / (2*I_avg) or something else. I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, let me think again. In AM, when you modulate a carrier, the current (or voltage) varies. The unmodulated current is the carrier current. When modulated, the current reaches a maximum and a minimum. So the carrier current is the average, and the modulation adds and subtracts from that.

So the unmodulated current is I_c, which is 15A here. When modulated, the current goes up to I_c + I_m (maximum) and down to I_c - I_m (minimum). So the maximum current in this case is 17A.

Wait, the modulated current varies between I_c (1 + m) and I_c (1 - m), where m is the modulation index. Wait no, I think the formula is that the maximum current is I_c (1 + m), and the minimum is I_c (1 - m). So the maximum current is I_max = I_c * (1 + m), and the minimum is I_min = I_c * (1 - m). 

But wait, in the problem, the current increases to 17A when modulated. But does that mean that 17A is the maximum current, or is it the peak current during modulation? Because in AM, the current varies between I_max and I_min, centered around the carrier current I_c.

Wait, but the question says the magnitude of the antenna current is 15A when unmodulated, and increases to 17A for a modulated signal. Hmm, does that mean that 17A is the maximum current when modulated? Or is it the average? Or is the current varying, but the peak is 17A.

Wait, I think that when the signal is modulated, the current varies between 15(1 + m) and 15(1 - m). So the maximum current is 15*(1 + m) = 17A. So I can solve for m.

So 15*(1 + m) = 17 → 1 + m = 17/15 → m = (17/15) -1 → 2/15 ≈ 0.1333. So m is approximately 13.33%. But wait, the options don't have 13%, so perhaps I'm doing something wrong.

Wait, perhaps the approach is different. Another way: The percentage modulation is given by (I_max - I_min)/(I_max + I_min) * 100%. Or is it (I_max - I_min)/(2 I_unmodulated) ) * 100%?

Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me recall the correct formula.

The modulation index m is defined as m = (I_max - I_min)/(I_max + I_min). And the percentage modulation is m * 100%.

Wait, but another formula I've seen is percentage modulation = (I_max - I_min)/(2 I_c) ) * 100%, where I_c is the carrier current. Because I_max is I_c (1 + m), and I_min is I_c (1 - m). So I_max + I_min = 2 I_c.

So, I_max - I_min = 2 I_c m.

So, (I_max - I_min) / (2 I_c) ) = m.

So, the percentage modulation is m *100% = [(I_max - I_min)/(2 I_c)] *100%.

But in the problem, the unmodulated current is 15A, and the modulated current is 17A. Wait, modulated current: is that the average or the peak? Because if it's modulated, the current varies, so I think the 17A is the maximum current. So perhaps I_min is 13A and I_max is 17A, with the average being 15 (because (17+13)/2=15). But wait, the unmodulated current is 15A, so that makes sense.

Wait, so if I_max is 17, then I_min would be 13 (since 17-15=2, so I_min = 15-2=13).

So I_max = 17, I_min =13.

So, using the formula: m = (17-13)/(17+13) =4/30 ≈ 0.1333 → 13.33% modulation.

But looking at the options, I don't see 13% as an option. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the question says the current increases to 17A for a modulated signal. Does that mean that the maximum current is 17A, or is it the peak current regardless of the minimum?

Alternatively, perhaps the current when modulated is 17A, but that's the maximum. So I_min would be 17A minus twice the modulation current.

Wait, perhaps I should model it differently. Let me think: the carrier current is I_c. When modulated, the current is I_c + I_m, where I_m is the modulating current. So the maximum current is I_c + I_m, and the minimum is I_c - I_m.

So, I_max = I_c + I_m.

I_min = I_c - I_m.

So, the difference between I_max and I_min is 2 I_m.

So, the percentage modulation is m = (I_m / I_c) * 100%.

But how do I find I_m?

I know that I_max = I_c + I_m = 17A.

I_c is 15A. So 15 + I_m = 17 → I_m = 2A.

So m = (2 / 15) *100% ≈ 13.33%. But none of the options match. So perhaps I'm using the wrong approach.

Wait, maybe the question is using a different formula. Another way: when modulated, the total current is I_c multiplied by (1 + m). So I_max = I_c (1 + m). So perhaps the question is considering that when modulated, the current is 17A. So 17 = 15 (1 + m). Solving for m: 17/15 = 1.1333 → m = 0.1333 → 13.33%. Still, no option matches. So perhaps the correct approach is another method.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that the current varies between 15A and 17A, so I_max is 17, I_min is 15? But that can't be right because the carrier is 15. Oh wait, perhaps in this case, the modulation causes the current to vary above and below the carrier, but the maximum is 17, and the minimum is something else.

Wait no, the unmodulated current is 15. So when modulated, the current varies between 15*(1 + m) and 15*(1 - m). So if the maximum is 17A, then 15*(1+m) =17 → (1+m)=17/15 → m=2/15 ≈ 13.33%.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps the question is considering that the modulated current is 17A, and the unmodulated is 15. So the difference is 2A. Maybe the modulation is double that? Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another approach. The formula for percentage modulation is [ (I_max - I_min) / (2 I_c) ] * 100%. But in this problem, I_max is 17, I_min is 13 (since 17 and 13 average to 15). So (17 -13)/(2 *15) →4/30=0.1333, so 13.33%. Again, same result.

Wait, the options provided are A:100%, B:60%, C:75%, D:25%, E:50%, F:30%, G:20%, H:40%, I:80%, J:90%.

None of these match 13.33%. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the modulated current is 17A, but that's the average, not the peak. But that doesn't make sense because in AM, the average current is higher than the carrier when there's a positive modulation.

Wait, no. Wait, in AM, the average power is higher when modulated, but average current depends on how you measure it. Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the peak current as 17A, and the unmodulated as 15A, so the modulation is 2A above 15A. So the modulation index (m) is (I_max - I_c)/I_c → (17-15)/15 ≈ 13.33%. Again, same as before.

Hmm, perhaps the question is expecting a different approach. Wait, what if the maximum current is 17A, and the minimum is 13A, as before. Then, the modulation index m = (17-13)/(17+13) =4/30= 0.1333 → 13.33%. But that still doesn't match any option.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the terms. Maybe the question is using a different formula, such as (I_max - I_unmodulated) / I_unmodulated * 100%?

So that would be (17-15)/15 *100% = (2/15)*100 ≈13.33%. Again, same issue.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here. Another possibility is that the problem is asking for the ratio between the modulated current and the unmodulated, but that's not standard.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the 17A is the total current during modulation, which includes the carrier and the sidebands. Oh wait, but in AM, the total power is split between carrier and the two sidebands. The carrier is I_c, and the sidebands each have I_c*(m/2), where m is the modulation index.

Wait, so the maximum current is I_c (1 + m), and the minimum is I_c (1 - m). So the difference I_max - I_min is 2 I_c m.

But in the problem, the current when modulated is 17A. Wait, but that would be the maximum. The minimum would be 15*(1 - m) =13A as before.

So, the average current when modulated is I_avg = (I_max + I_min)/2 = (17+13)/2=15, which matches the unmodulated carrier. So that makes sense.

But again, the modulation index comes to about 13.33%, which isn't an option. So perhaps the question is phrased differently. Maybe the 17A is the RMS current when modulated, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using the formula for percentage modulation as (I_modulated - I_unmodulated)/I_unmodulated * 100%. So (17-15)/15 *100% = 13.33%. Doesn't match any option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that when modulated, the current increases by 2A, which is 17-15=2. So perhaps it's a 100% modulation because 2A is twice the carrier? No, that can't be right. Because 100% modulation would mean the carrier is doubled, which would make I_max=30A, I think. So that's not it.

Wait, another approach: The percentage modulation is sometimes defined as the ratio of the peak modulated current to the unmodulated current. So 17/15 = 1.133..., which would be 113.3%, which is more than 100%. But that's not possible because modulation can't exceed 100%.

Wait, no. Wait, the maximum modulation is 100%, where the carrier is completely modulated, meaning the current drops to zero in the minimum. So if m=1, I_min=0. So if I_min is zero, then m=1.

In our case, m is 2/15≈0.133, which is 13.33%.

So, I'm not seeing how any of the options match. Unless perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that the modulated current is varying between 15A and 17A. So I_max=17, I_min=15. Then, m = (17-15)/(17+15) = 2/32=0.0625 →6.25%. But that's not in the options either.

Wait, but that would be incorrect because if the unmodulated is 15, the modulated should swing both above and below 15. So I_min would be less than 15. So I think that approach is wrong.

I'm stuck. Let me think again. Perhaps the question is referring to the antenna current when modulated as the RMS current? But that's more complicated.

Wait, the formula for percentage modulation is (I_max - I_min)/(2 I_c) *100% = m *100%. So, if I_max is 17 and I_min is 13, then (17-13)/(2*15) →4/30= 0.1333 →13.33%, which is not an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that the average current when modulated is 17A. That doesn't make sense because in AM, the average current is higher than the carrier only if the modulation is asymmetrical, but normally the average remains the same as the carrier when symmetrically modulated.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me check the possible options again. The closest options are G:20% and F:30%. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps the formula for percentage modulation is (I_max - I_c)/I_c *100% = m*100% → (17-15)/15 *100% = 13.33%. Again, same result. So none of the options match.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the ratio of the modulated current to the unmodulated, not considering the formula. So 17/15=1.133, which is 13.3% increase. So that's the percentage increase, but that's not the modulation percentage.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering that the current increases by 2A, so the modulation is 2A, and the percentage is (2/(15+ something))... Not sure.

Wait, perhaps the formula is (I_max - I_min)/(I_max + I_min) = m. So if I_max is 17, and the unmodulated is 15, then I_min is 13. So (17-13)/(17+13)=4/30≈0.1333 →13.33%, which again is not in the options.

Hmm. Maybe the question intended to present different numbers. Or perhaps I'm missing a key point.

Wait, another approach. Maybe the question is looking for the ratio of the increase in current to the original current, expressed as a percentage. So (17-15)/15 *100 = 13.33%. But that's not the standard definition of percentage modulation.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the modulation as the ratio of the change in current to the maximum current. So (2/17)*100≈11.76%. Still not matching any options.

I'm starting to think that perhaps the intended answer is 20%, which is option G. But why?

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the increase as 2A, and the unmodulated as 15A. So 2/15 is 0.133 →13%, but perhaps the intended approach was (2/ (15+ something)).

Alternatively, perhaps the formula used is (I_max - I_min)/I_max *100%. So (17-13)/17=4/17≈23.5%. Closest to 20% or 25%. So option G is 20%, D is 25%.

But that doesn't align with the standard formula.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the problem is considering that the modulated current is 17A, which is the peak. So the unmodulated is 15A. So the modulation is (17-15)/15 *100% = 13.33%, which is approximately 13%. But again, no option.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is phrased incorrectly, and the modulated current is 17A, which is the average, but that doesn't make sense because in AM the average current during modulation is the same as the unmodulated if symmetrically modulated.

Wait, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look up the standard formula again.

Standard formula: Percentage Modulation = (I_max - I_min)/(I_max + I_min) *100%.

Given that, and assuming I_max is 17A, I_min is 13A (since 15 is the average of 17 and 13), then (17-13)/(17+13)=4/30=13.33%. So the correct answer should be approximately 13.33%, but it's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the modulated current is 17A, which is the same as the maximum. So the formula would be (I_max - I_c)/I_c *100% → 2/15=13.33%.

But again, no option matches. So perhaps the correct answer is not among the options, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the question states that the magnitude of the antenna current is 15A unmodulated and increases to 17A modulated. So perhaps the current is 15A when unmodulated, and when modulated, the current varies between 15A and 17A. So I_max is 17, I_min is 15. Then, applying the formula (17-15)/(17+15) *100% = 2/32=6.25%. Still no option.

Alternatively, perhaps the modulation is (17-15)/(2*15) *100% → (2)/(30) →6.66%. No.

Hmm. Maybe the intended answer is 20% (option G), but I'm not seeing how. Alternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the formula for AM modulation. Let me think again.

In AM, the carrier current is I_c. The modulated current is given by I = I_c (1 + m cos ω_mt), where m is the modulation index.

The maximum current is I_c (1 + m), and the minimum is I_c (1 - m).

So, I_max = I_c (
