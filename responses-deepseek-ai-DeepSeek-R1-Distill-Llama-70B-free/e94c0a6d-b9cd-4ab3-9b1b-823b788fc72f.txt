Okay, so I've got this problem about neutrons in a reactor, and I need to figure out when the number of neutrons reaches half a billion. Let me break it down.

The question says that the number of neutrons doubles every minute. So it's like exponential growth, right? At each minute, the count multiplies by two. And it reaches one billion neutrons in 10 minutes. I need to find out when it was half a billion.

Wait, one billion is 1e9, and half a billion is 5e8. But maybe I don't need to get into exact numbers. Since it's doubling each time, maybe I can work backwards.

So, at 10 minutes, it's 1e9. If I go back one minute, that would be 5e8, which is half a billion. Because each step back in time halves the number. So that's at 9 minutes. So the answer should be 9 minutes. Let me check the options. Option A is 9 minutes, so that should be the correct choice.

Wait, could I have made a mistake? Let me think again. So if each minute it doubles, then at 10 mins it's 1e9. At 9 mins, it's half that, which is 5e8, which is half a billion. Yep, that makes sense. So yes, 9 minutes is the right answer.

The number of neutrons doubles every minute. Starting from one billion neutrons at 10 minutes, working backward, the count halves each minute. Therefore, at 9 minutes, the count was half a billion. 

Answer: A.
