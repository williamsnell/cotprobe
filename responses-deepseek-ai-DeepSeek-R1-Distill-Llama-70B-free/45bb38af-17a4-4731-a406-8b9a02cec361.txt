Okay, I need to figure out the correct answer to this question about the Leiter International Performance Scale. Hmm, I remember that Leiter is a type of intelligence test, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think.

I think the Leiter scale is used for measuring non-verbal intelligence. Oh right, because it's called a performance scale. So it probably doesn't require verbal responses. That makes it suitable for people who can't speak or have speech impairments, or maybe those who are non-verbal for other reasons.

The options are about different groups. Let's go through them one by one. 

Option A: adults with speech impairments. That could make sense because if the test is non-verbal, they wouldn't need to speak. But wait, I think Leiter is primarily used with children. Or is it?

Option B: children under two. I'm not sure about the age range for Leiter. I think it's used for children as well, but maybe starting a bit older. Like maybe from 2 upwards. So perhaps B is possible.

Option C: adults who are mentally retarded. The term is outdated, but I guess they mean intellectually disabled. But if Leiter is for children, this might not be the best fit unless it's used across ages.

Option D: adults with physical disabilities. Physical disabilities wouldn't affect taking a performance test if it's non-verbal, but again, if Leiter is for kids, maybe not.

Option E: children with hearing impairments. Oh, that makes sense. If they can't hear, a non-verbal test would be appropriate. So Leiter could be used here.

Option G: children with visual impairments. Wait, Leiter uses visual materials, right? Because performance tests often involve pictures or spatial tasks. So if a child can't see, they can't take the test. So G might not be correct.

Option B and E are possibilities. I remember that Leiter is often used with children who can't speak or have hearing impairments because it doesn't require verbal responses. So children with hearing impairments (E) would benefit. Also, maybe children under two could use it, but I think Leiter starts around age 2 or 3. So B might not be the best choice if Leiter is for slightly older children.

Wait, another thought. Leiter is especially designed to be non-verbal, so it's useful for assessing individuals where verbal tests aren't suitable. That includes those with hearing impairments, speech impairments, or where language might be a barrier, like non-English speakers.

Looking at the options again, E is children with hearing impairments. That fits. Also, I think the Leiter test was originally developed for children, so the correct answer would be about children, not adults.

So the answer is E: children with hearing impairments.

The Leiter International Performance Scale is a non-verbal intelligence test designed to assess cognitive abilities without requiring verbal responses. This makes it particularly suitable for individuals who cannot speak, have hearing impairments, or face language barriers. Among the options provided, children with hearing impairments (Option E) are the most appropriate group for using this scale, as it accommodates their needs by relying on visual and performance-based tasks rather than verbal communication. Additionally, the Leiter scale is primarily used for children, making options related to adults less relevant in this context.

Answer: E
