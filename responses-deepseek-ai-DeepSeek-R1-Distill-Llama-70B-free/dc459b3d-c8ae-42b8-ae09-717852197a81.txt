Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these gas law concepts. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about expanding a liter of oxygen so that the mean free path of the molecules becomes 2 meters. Oh wait, the mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between collisions, right? So expanding the gas would make the molecules have more space and thus a longer mean free path.

The molecules have a diameter of 3 Angstroms, which is 3e-10 meters or 0.3 nanometers. I think I'll need that to calculate the effective area each molecule occupies or something like that.

The gas starts at STP, which is standard temperature and pressure. I remember STP is 0 degrees Celsius (273.15 K) and 1 atmosphere pressure (101325 Pascals). Oh wait, no, wait, STP for gases is sometimes considered as 22.4 liters per mole at 0°C and 1 atm. But sometimes in physics, STP is 273 K and 1 atm. Either way, the exact values might be important, so I'll keep that in mind.

I need to find the volume to which 1 liter of oxygen must be expanded to achieve a mean free path of 2 meters. So I think I should use the formula for mean free path. From what I remember, the mean free path (λ) is given by λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2)*π*d^2*P), where k is Boltzmann's constant, T is temperature, d is the diameter of the molecule, and P is the pressure.

Alternatively, another formula I'm recalling links the mean free path to the number of molecules per unit volume. Because if the molecules are more spread out, the mean free path increases. So maybe λ = 1/(sqrt(2) * π * d^2 * n), where n is the number density (number per volume). Hmm, that makes sense because n would be inversely proportional to volume.

So the plan is: find the number of molecules in 1 liter of O2 at STP, then determine what volume would make the mean free path 2 meters.

Wait, but wait. If I expand the gas, the number of molecules remains the same (assuming it's the same gas sample), so n changes because n = N/V, where N is the number of molecules and V is the volume. So the expansion affects V, which affects n, which affects λ.

Let me get this straight. At STP, 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 liters. So 1 liter is 1/22.4 moles. Number of molecules is (1/22.4) * Avogadro's number (6.022e23). So N = (6.022e23) / 22.4 ≈ 2.686e22 molecules.

Wait, but when I expand the gas, the number of molecules N stays the same, but the volume V increases, so n = N/V decreases. And since mean free path λ is inversely proportional to n, λ increases when n decreases.

So the setup is:

λ = 1/(sqrt(2) * π * d² * n)

But n is N/V, so substituting:

λ = V / (sqrt(2) * π * d² * N )

Wait, let me check that substitution. Since n = N/V, then 1/n = V/(N). So:

λ = 1/(sqrt(2) π d² n) ) → λ = (1/n) / (sqrt(2) π d² ) → λ = (V/(N)) / (sqrt(2) π d² )

So λ = V / (sqrt(2) π d² N )

Wait, but wait. Let me think. I've seen the formula as λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2) π d^2 P), and since PV = nRT, P = nRT/V. So n = N/V * (k*T/P) ? Hmm, maybe that's another approach.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to express n in terms of the ideal gas law. Let's see.

At any rate, I think the approach should be:

1. Find the number of molecules in 1 liter at STP. Because when we expand, the number stays the same.

2. Use the mean free path formula to find the new volume V.

So, step 1: Calculate N, the number of molecules in 1 liter at STP.

At STP, 1 mole is 22.4 liters. So 1 liter is 1/22.4 moles. Moles = n = PV/(RT). But since we're working at STP, n = (1 atm * 1 L) / (R * 273 K). Wait, but since 22.4 L is 1 mole at STP, 1 L is 1/22.4 moles. So N = (1/22.4) * 6.022e23 ≈ 2.686e22 molecules.

Step 2: Use the mean free path formula.

Mean free path λ = 1/(sqrt(2) π d² n), where n is the number density (molecules per volume).

But n = N / V, so λ = 1/(sqrt(2) π d² (N/V)) ) → λ = V / (sqrt(2) π d² N )

We can rearrange to solve for V:

V = λ * sqrt(2) π d² N

Wait, because λ = V/(sqrt(2) π d² N), so V = λ * sqrt(2) π d² N

Yes, that's correct.

Now, plugging in the numbers.

Given:

λ = 2 m

d = 3 Angstroms = 3e-10 m

N = 2.686e22 molecules

So compute V:

V = 2 * sqrt(2) * π * (3e-10)^2 * 2.686e22

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute sqrt(2) ≈ 1.4142.

Then, (3e-10)^2 = 9e-20 m².

Multiply all the constants:

2 * 1.4142 * π ≈ 2 * 1.4142 * 3.1416 ≈ let's compute that.

2 * 1.4142 = 2.8284

2.8284 * 3.1416 ≈ 8.8858 (since 3 * 2.8284 is 8.4852, 0.1416*2.8284≈0.400, so total around 8.885)

Wait wait, more accurately:

3.1416 * 2.8284:

Let me compute 3 * 2.8284 = 8.4852

0.1416 * 2.8284 ≈ 0.1416 * 2.8 = ~0.3965, and 0.1416 * 0.0284≈~0.004, so total ≈0.4005.

So total is 8.4852 + 0.4005 = 8.8857.

So that part is approximately 8.8857.

Now, multiply by 9e-20 m²:

8.8857 * 9e-20 = 79.9713e-20 = 7.99713e-19 m^3.

Wait, no, wait. The units would be (m^2) * (unitless) * (m^3)? Wait, let me think.

Wait, V is in m³, right? Because the other terms are:

lambda (m) * sqrt(2) (unitless) * pi (unitless) * d^2 (m²) * N (unitless, but count).

So the product is in m*(m²) = m³. So yes, V will be in m³.

So 8.8857 * 9e-20 = 79.971e-20 = 7.9971e-19 m³.

But wait, no: 8.8857 * (3e-10)^2 is 8.8857 * 9e-20 = (8.8857 *9) * 1e-20.

8 *9=72, 0.8857*9≈7.9713, so total is 79.9713e-20 → 7.99713e-19 m³.

Now, multiply by N:

N is 2.686e22 molecules.

So 7.99713e-19 m³ * 2.686e22 = ?

Multiply 7.99713e-19 * 2.686e22.

7.99713 * 2.686 ≈ let's compute 8 * 2.686 = 21.488, but since it's 7.997, which is 8 -0.003, so 8*2.686=21.488, minus 0.003*2.686=0.008058 → 21.488 -0.008058=21.4799.

Exponents: 1e-19 * 1e22 = 1e3.

So 21.4799e3 → 21479.9 m³.

Wait, that's a huge volume. 21,480 cubic meters? That seems way too big. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, wait. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me go back.

Wait, the formula I used was V = λ * sqrt(2) * π * d^2 * N.

But that gives a very large volume. Let me think: the mean free path is 2 meters, so if the gas is expanded, the volume must be much larger than 1 liter. But 21480 m³ seems really big. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check the formula for mean free path.

The correct formula for mean free path is λ = (k*T)/(sqrt(2) π d^2 P), where P is pressure. Alternatively, because PV = nRT → P = nRT/V → n = (N/V) = P/(RT).

Wait, but another formula for mean free path is λ = 1/(sqrt(2) π d^2 n ), where n is the number density (number per volume).

So in this case, if I know λ and d, I can solve for n, then use n = N/V to find V.

Yes, that's another approach.

So let's approach it that way.

λ = 1/(sqrt(2) π d^2 n )

We need to find V, so let's solve for n first.

n = 1/(sqrt(2) π d^2 λ )

Then, since n = N/V → V = N/(n) = N * sqrt(2) π d^2 λ

Wait, no, because n = 1/(sqrt(2) π d² λ ), so V = N / n = N * sqrt(2) π d² λ

Wait, that's the same formula as before. So V = N * sqrt(2) π d^2 λ

So plugging in the same numbers as before, I get the same result. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the units. Let me check the units again.

d is given in Angstroms, which I converted to meters: 3 Angstroms = 3e-10 meters. That's correct.

N is 2.686e22 molecules.

λ is 2 meters.

So let me recompute:

Compute sqrt(2) ≈ 1.4142

sqrt(2) * π ≈ 4.4429

d^2 = (3e-10 m)^2 = 9e-20 m²

So N * sqrt(2)*pi*d^2*lambda = 2.686e22 * 4.4429 * 9e-20 m² * 2 m.

Compute step by step:

First, 4.4429 *9e-20 = 4.4429 *9 = 40. (approx 40 if 4.4429 *9 is 39.9861) → 39.9861e-20 → 3.9986e-19 m².

Then multiply by 2 m: 3.9986e-19 * 2 = 7.9972e-19 m³.

Now multiply by N (2.686e22):

7.9972e-19 * 2.686e22 = 7.9972 * 2.686 = approx 21.48, and exponents 1e-19 *1e22 = 1e3.

So 21.48e3 m³ → 21480 m³.

But wait, 21480 cubic meters is 21,480,000 liters because 1 m³ = 1000 liters. Because 1 m³ = (10^3 cm)^3 = 1e6 cm³ = 1e3 liters.

Wait, 1 m³ equals 1000 liters. So 21480 m³ = 21,480,000 liters.

But the options are in cm³, so 1 m³ is 1e6 liters? Wait, no, wait. 1 m³ is 1e3 liters. Because 1 liter is 0.001 m³.

Wait, no, 1 m³ = 10^3 liters. Because 1 L = 1 dm³ = (0.1 m)^3 = 1e-3 m³. So 1 m³ = 1e3 L.

So 21480 m³ = 21,480 * 1e3 L = 21,480,000 L.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are in cm³. Let me convert 21480 m³ to cm³.

1 m = 100 cm → 1 m³ = (100 cm)^3 = 1e6 cm³.

So 21480 m³ = 21480 * 1e6 cm³ = 2.148e10 cm³.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.155e10 cm³, which is very close. Hmm, perhaps my approximation in the calculation led to that.

Wait, let's do the calculation more accurately.

Compute V = N * sqrt(2) * π * d² * λ

N = (6.022e23 molecules/mol) / 22.4 L/mol → 6.022e23 / 22.4 ≈ 2.688e22 molecules.

d = 3e-10 m.

λ = 2 m.

Compute each term:

sqrt(2) = 1.41421356

π = 3.14159265

So sqrt(2)*pi = 1.41421356 * 3.14159265 ≈ 4.442882908.

d squared: (3e-10)^2 =9e-20 m².

Multiply all terms:

V = 2.688e22 * 4.442882908 * 9e-20 * 2.

Let me compute step by step.

First, compute 4.44288 *9e-20 = 4.44288*9 =39.986 (so 39.986e-20) =3.9986e-19.

Multiply by 2: 3.9986e-19 *2=7.9972e-19.

Now multiply by N (2.688e22):

7.9972e-19 *2.688e22 = (7.9972 *2.688) *1e3.

7.9972 *2.688 → let's compute:

7 *2.688 =18.816

0.9972 *2.688 ≈ 2.68 (approx 2.68).

So total ≈18.816 + 2.68 =21.496.

So 21.496 *1e3 → 21496 m³.

Convert to cm³: 21496 m³ * 1e6 cm³/m³ = 2.1496e10 cm³.

Looking at the options, option B is 2.155 ×10^10 cm³, which is very close. The slight discrepancy might be due to rounding in intermediate steps. So the correct answer should be option B.

To determine the volume to which 1 liter of oxygen must be expanded to achieve a mean free path of 2 meters, we use the formula for mean free path:

\[
\lambda = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} \pi d^2 n}
\]

where:
- \( \lambda \) is the mean free path,
- \( d \) is the molecular diameter,
- \( n \) is the number density (molecules per unit volume).

Rearranging for \( n \):

\[
n = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2} \pi d^2 \lambda}
\]

Since \( n = \frac{N}{V} \), where \( N \) is the number of molecules and \( V \) is the volume, we can solve for \( V \):

\[
V = \frac{N}{n} = N \cdot \sqrt{2} \pi d^2 \lambda
\]

### Step 1: Calculate \( N \), the number of molecules in 1 liter of oxygen at STP
At STP, 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 liters, so 1 liter contains:

\[
N = \frac{1}{22.4} \cdot 6.022 \times 10^{23} \approx 2.686 \times 10^{22} \, \text{molecules}.
\]

### Step 2: Plug in the values
- \( \lambda = 2 \, \text{m} \),
- \( d = 3 \, \text{Å} = 3 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \),
- \( \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414 \),
- \( \pi \approx 3.1416 \).

First, calculate \( \sqrt{2} \pi \):

\[
\sqrt{2} \pi \approx 1.414 \cdot 3.1416 \approx 4.4429.
\]

Next, calculate \( d^2 \):

\[
d^2 = (3 \times 10^{-10})^2 = 9 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{m}^2.
\]

Now, calculate \( V \):

\[
V = N \cdot \sqrt{2} \pi d^2 \lambda = (2.686 \times 10^{22}) \cdot (4.4429) \cdot (9 \times 10^{-20}) \cdot 2.
\]

First, compute \( 4.4429 \cdot 9 \times
