Question:

The Extruded Plastics Company distributes overhead to each of its six departments according to the ratio of total overhead to the total direct labor costs. During January, the total overhead for the factory was $20,000; the total direct labor cost $140,000. Find the ratio to be applied to all departments. Then find the amount to be charged to the Quality Control Department whose direct labor costs for the month were $16,000.

Options:

A: $5,000
B: $2,285.71
C: $4,000
D: $4,285.71
E: $3,428.57
F: $1,142.86
G: $3,500
H: $1,000
I: $1,714.29
J: $2,857.14

Okay, so I have this accounting problem in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The company is called Extruded Plastics Company, and they distribute their overhead costs to each department based on the ratio of total overhead to total direct labor costs. So, in January, their total overhead was $20,000, and the total direct labor cost was $140,000. I need to find the ratio they apply and then calculate how much is charged to the Quality Control Department, which had direct labor costs of $16,000.

Hmm. I remember that overhead allocation can be based on different bases, like direct labor hours, machine hours, or direct labor costs. In this case, it's the ratio of total overhead to total direct labor costs. So the ratio would be total overhead divided by total direct labor.

Let me write that down. Ratio = Total Overhead / Total Direct Labor. So that's 20,000 divided by 140,000. Let me calculate that. 20,000 divided by 140,000... Well, 20 divided by 140 is the same as 1/7, because 140 divided by 20 is 7. So the ratio is 1/7, or approximately 0.142857.

So that's the ratio applied across all departments. Now, each department's overhead charge is this ratio multiplied by their direct labor cost. For the Quality Control Department, their direct labor was $16,000. So the overhead charged to them would be 16,000 multiplied by 1/7.

Calculating that: 16,000 divided by 7. Let me do the division. 7 goes into 16 twice, which is 14, remainder 2. Bring down a zero: 20. 7 into 20 is 2 again (14), remainder 6. Another zero: 60. 7 into 60 is 8 (56), remainder 4. Next zero: 40. 7 into 40 is 5 (35), remainder 5. Another zero: 50. 7 into 50 is 7 (49), remainder 1. One more zero: 10. 7 into 10 is 1, remainder 3. So far, I have 2, then 2, then 8, 5, 7, 1... Wait, maybe I should just do it more carefully.

Wait, 7 * 2285 is 15,995, because 7 * 2000=14000, 7*285=1995. So 14000+1995=15995. So 16,000 minus 15,995 is 5. So the division is 2285 with 5/7 left. So 5/7 is approximately 0.714285. So 2285.714285... So the amount is $2,285.71 when rounded to the nearest cent.

Looking at the options, option B is $2,285.71. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps. The ratio is 20k /140k, which is 1/7. Then 16k * 1/7 is approximately 2,285.71. Yep, that seems right. So the correct choice is B.

The ratio used to allocate overhead is calculated as total overhead divided by total direct labor costs. For January, this is:

\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{\$20,000}{\$140,000} = \frac{1}{7} \approx 0.142857
\]

The Quality Control Department's direct labor cost is $16,000. Applying the ratio:

\[
\text{Overhead Charge} = \$16,000 \times \frac{1}{7} = \$2,285.71
\]

Thus, the amount charged to the Quality Control Department is **$2,285.71**, corresponding to option **B**.

B
