Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's take it step by step. 

The question presents two statements and asks whether they are true or false, and then matches them to the given options. The options are combinations of whether each statement is correct or not, along with some context about each statement.

First, let me look at Statement 1: "For a continuous random variable x and its probability distribution function p(x), it holds that 0 ≤ p(x) ≤ 1 for all x." 

Hmm, wait a second. I remember that for continuous random variables, the probability distribution function is actually called a probability density function (pdf). And the key thing about a pdf is that the total area under the curve must equal 1. But for individual points, the value of p(x) can actually be greater than 1. For example, the uniform distribution on [0,1] has p(x) = 1 for x in that interval, which is fine. But what about something like the normal distribution? Oh wait, no, the normal distribution's peak is around 0.4, so that's less than 1. But consider a distribution where the range is smaller. Like, say, a uniform distribution between 0 and 0.5. Then the pdf would be 2, because 1/(0.5-0) = 2. So in that case, p(x) would be 2, which is greater than 1. So Statement 1 is false because p(x) can be greater than 1 for some x in a continuous distribution.

Now, moving on to Statement 2: "Decision tree is learned by minimizing information gain." 

Wait, I thought that decision trees, like in machine learning, use information gain as a criterion for splitting nodes. Information gain is the measure used to decide which feature to split on. The algorithm tries to maximize information gain, not minimize it. Oh wait, wait—could it be minimizing something else, like maybe the loss function or entropy? Let me think. The information gain is calculated as the reduction in entropy (or impurity) after a split. So the algorithm selects splits that maximize the information gain. So if the statement says it's learned by minimizing information gain, that would be incorrect. Therefore, Statement 2 is false.

Now, let me look at the options. The options are from A to J. Each option gives a pair: whether Statement 1 is correct or not, and the same for Statement 2.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I got Statement 2 right. So in decision trees, we calculate information gain as the difference in entropy before and after a split. We want to choose the split that gives the highest information gain. So the algorithm aims to maximize information gain, not minimize it. So the statement that says decision trees are learned by minimizing information gain is incorrect. So Statement 2 is false.

So now, I need to find the option where both Statements 1 and 2 are false.

Looking at the options:

Option E: False, False. That would be if Statement 1 is false and Statement 2 is false. That's what I concluded, correct?

Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't mix up any details. For Statement 1, yes, the pdf for a continuous variable doesn't have to be ≤1 everywhere. It's the integral over all x that equals 1, not each individual p(x). So Statement 1 is definitely false.

As for Statement 2, the decision tree learning process indeed maximizes information gain, so saying it minimizes is incorrect. So Statement 2 is also false.

So the correct answer would have both statements as false. Which is option E: False, False.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's check what each option says:

Option E: False, False.

Yes, that's exactly what we need. So the answer should be E.

The question evaluates the validity of two statements and matches them to the given options. 

**Statement 1**: "For a continuous random variable \( x \) and its probability distribution function \( p(x) \), it holds that \( 0 \leq p(x) \leq 1 \) for all \( x \)."  
This statement is false. For continuous random variables, \( p(x) \) represents a probability density function (pdf). While the total area under the pdf curve must equal 1, the value of \( p(x) \) at individual points can exceed 1. For example, a uniform distribution on a smaller interval can have \( p(x) > 1 \). Thus, Statement 1 is incorrect.

**Statement 2**: "Decision tree is learned by minimizing information gain."  
This statement is also false. Decision trees in machine learning are typically learned by maximizing information gain, which measures the reduction in entropy or impurity after a split. The algorithm selects splits that maximize information gain, not minimize it. Therefore, Statement 2 is incorrect.

Given that both statements are false, the correct option is **E: False, False**.
