C: 0.39^2
D: 0.85
E: 0.39
F: 0.15^2
G: 0.15

Okay, so I've got this question about correlation between GPA and study time. Hmm, I remember that correlation has something to do with how two variables relate. The question says that about 15% of the variability in GPA is explained by the study time. Wait, I think that's about the coefficient of determination or something like that.

Correlation coefficient is usually denoted as r, right? And the coefficient of determination is r squared. So if r is 0.39, then r squared would be 0.39 * 0.39, which is around 0.15 or 15%. Oh wait, because r squared tells us the proportion of variance explained. So in the question, 15% variability is accounted for, which would mean r squared is 0.15.

So the question is asking what the correlation (r) is when r squared is 0.15. Let me check the options. Option C is 0.39 squared, but wait, that's actually 0.39^2 which is 0.1521. So that would be r squared. But the question is about the correlation itself, which would be the square root of 0.15.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is 0.39. Oh, right, because 0.39 squared is approximately 0.15. So the correlation would be 0.39. So the answer is E.

Wait, but let me make sure. The question says the correlation is __, and that 15% is accounted for. So r squared is 0.15, so r is sqrt(0.15) which is approximately 0.387, which we can round to 0.39. Yeah, that makes sense.

The question asks for the correlation coefficient (r) between high school students' GPA and the amount of time they spend studying, given that about 15% of the variability in GPA is accounted for by study time. This means the coefficient of determination, \( r^2 \), is 0.15. To find \( r \), we take the square root of 0.15, which is approximately 0.39. Among the options provided, 0.39 corresponds to option E.

Answer: E
