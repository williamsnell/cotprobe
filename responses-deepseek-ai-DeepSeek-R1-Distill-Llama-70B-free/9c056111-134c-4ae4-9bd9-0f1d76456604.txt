Question:

A homeowner was injured when he slipped and fell in a puddle of water on his sunroom floor; the water had accumulated on the floor during a rainstorm because of leaks in the roof. The roof's manufacturer had supplied nondefective materials to the installer, who was a franchisee (and not an employee) of the manufacturer. The leaks resulted from the carelessness of the installer during the from the carelessness of the installer during the installation of the roof. The installer's truck, which had been parked in front of the homeowner's house during the roof installation, bore the manufacturer's logo. The manufacturer was aware that the truck and the literature supplied by the installer both displayed the manufacturer's logo. Is there any basis for a claim by the homeowner against the manufacturer?

Options:

A: Yes, because the manufacturer was aware that the installer used their logo.
B: Yes, because the installer was a franchisee of the manufacturer.
C: No, because the homeowner was responsible for choosing the installer.
D: Yes, because the installer's truck displayed the manufacturer's logo.
E: No, because the manufacturer only supplied nondefective materials.
F: No, because the leaks were due to the installer's negligence, not the manufacturer's.
G: No, because a franchisor has no duty to supervise the conduct of a franchisee.
H: Yes, under the rule of vicarious liability.
I: No, under the rule that a manufacturer is liable only for defects in a product that existed at the time the product left the hands of the manufacturer.
J: Yes, under the rule of apparent agency.

Okay, so I've got this question about tort law, specifically product liability and possibly vicarious liability. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The situation is that a homeowner was injured when he slipped on a puddle in his sunroom. The water got there because the roof was leaking during a rainstorm. The roof's manufacturer supplied materials to the installer, who was a franchisee, not an employee. The leaks were due to the installer's carelessness during installation. Also, the installer's truck had the manufacturer's logo, and the manufacturer knew about that. 

So the question is whether the homeowner can claim against the manufacturer. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the right one.

Let me think about the possible legal theories here. The main possibilities seem to be vicarious liability, strict liability for defective products, or perhaps something like negligent hiring or supervision.

First, the manufacturer supplied non-defective materials. So, if the materials weren't faulty, then under strict product liability, the manufacturer might not be liable. Because strict liability usually applies when the product is defective and causes injury. Here, the problem was with the installation, not the product itself. So the manufacturer probably isn't liable under strict product liability.

Next, could there be vicarious liability? Vicarious liability applies when an employer is liable for the actions of an employee performed within the scope of employment. But here, the installer is a franchisee, not an employee. So unless the manufacturer had control over the installer's work, which doesn't seem to be the case, vicarious liability might not apply. So options like H (vicarious liability) or J (apparent agency) might come into play here.

Wait, apparent agency. That's when a principal (like the manufacturer) is held liable for the actions of an agent because the principal held the agent out as having authority, and the plaintiff reasonably relied on that. So if the installer's truck had the manufacturer's logo, maybe the homeowner thought the installer was acting on behalf of the manufacturer. 

But does that make the manufacturer liable for the installer's negligence? Apparent agency typically applies in cases where the principal is responsible for the agent's actions because the third party reasonably believes the agent is acting on the principal's behalf. So, if the installer was using the manufacturer's logo and appeared to be the manufacturer's agent, the homeowner might have relied on that, thinking the manufacturer was responsible for the installation.

In such a case, the manufacturer could be held vicariously liable for the installer's negligence if apparent agency is established. So option J suggests that. Alternatively, option A says yes because the manufacturer was aware the installer used their logo. But awareness alone might not be enough; it's more about whether the manufacturer allowed the use and whether the homeowner reasonably believed the installer was the manufacturer's agent.

Option D says yes because the truck displayed the manufacturer's logo. But again, it's more than just displaying the logo. It's whether the manufacturer held the installer out as their agent. So if the manufacturer allowed the logo to be used, perhaps they are liable under apparent agency.

Option B is about the installer being a franchisee. But being a franchisee doesn't automatically make the franchisor liable for the franchisee's actions, especially if they're independent contractors. So B might not be correct.

Option G says no because a franchisor has no duty to supervise a franchisee. That's generally true; franchisors aren't usually liable for the actions of their franchisees unless there's some specific reason, like if they were negligent in selecting the franchisee or if they exercised control over the franchisee's work.

In this case, the manufacturer supplied materials and the installer was a franchisee. The manufacturer knew the logo was used, but that alone doesn't create a duty unless it creates an apparent agency. So the key here is whether the manufacturer is liable under apparent agency.

Option I says no because the manufacturer is only liable for defects existing when the product left them. Since the materials were non-defective, this would apply. But if the claim is based on negligence ( installer's actions) rather than product defect, then I doesn't directly answer that.

Option F says no because the leaks were due to installer's negligence, not manufacturer's. That makes sense because the manufacturer's materials were fine, but the installer messed up. So if the installer is an independent contractor, the manufacturer isn't liable. Unless there's another reason, like apparent agency.

So, putting it together: the possible bases for the manufacturer's liability are either apparent agency or vicarious liability. But vicarious liability requires an employer-employee relationship, which isn't the case here. So apparent agency is the more plausible option.

Therefore, the answer would be J: Yes, under the rule of apparent agency.

Wait, but let me think again. The installer is a franchisee, which might imply some level of control, but generally, franchisees are independent contractors. The manufacturer allowing their logo to be used might create the appearance that the installer is acting on their behalf. So the homeowner could reasonably believe that the installer was an agent of the manufacturer, making the manufacturer liable for the installer's negligence.

So yes, option J seems correct.

The question revolves around whether the homeowner can hold the manufacturer liable for injuries caused by a leaking roof due to the installer's negligence. The manufacturer supplied non-defective materials, so strict product liability does not apply. The installer, as a franchisee, is an independent contractor, and vicarious liability generally does not extend to independent contractors unless specific conditions are met, such as apparent agency.

Apparent agency applies when a principal (here, the manufacturer) is held liable for the actions of an agent (the installer) because the principal represented the agent as having authority, and the third party (the homeowner) reasonably relied on this representation. The installer's truck displayed the manufacturer's logo, and the manufacturer was aware of this. This could create the appearance that the installer was acting on behalf of the manufacturer, leading the homeowner to reasonably believe the installer was the manufacturer's agent. If this apparent agency is established, the manufacturer could be held liable for the installer's negligence.

Other options, such as vicarious liability (H) or the installer being a franchisee (B), do not apply because the installer is an independent contractor, and vicarious liability requires an employer-employee relationship. The manufacturer's awareness of the logo (A) or the logo's display (D) alone is insufficient without establishing apparent agency. The manufacturer's lack of supervision over the franchisee (G) and the non-defective materials (I, E, F) also do not support liability under other theories.

Thus, the correct basis for liability is apparent agency, as the manufacturer's actions could have led the homeowner to reasonably believe the installer was acting on the manufacturer's behalf.
