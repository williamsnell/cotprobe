Okay, so I have to find the arc length of y = (1/4)x^4 from x=1 to x=2 using the Trapezoidal Rule T5. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, I remember that the formula for the arc length of a function y = f(x) from a to b is the integral from a to b of sqrt(1 + [f'(x)]²) dx. Right, so first I need to find the derivative of y with respect to x.

So f(x) is (1/4)x^4. The derivative f'(x) would be (1/4)*4x^3, which simplifies to x^3. Got that, so f'(x) = x^3.

Now, the integrand becomes sqrt(1 + (x^3)^2) = sqrt(1 + x^6). So the integral is from 1 to 2 of sqrt(1 + x^6) dx. But wait, the question says to use the Trapezoidal Rule T5. T5 means n=5 intervals, right? Because the number of intervals is usually denoted by n, and T_n is the trapezoidal rule with n intervals.

Wait, no, wait. Actually, sometimes T_n refers to the number of trapezoids, which would mean n+1 points. So if it's T5, that's 5 intervals, which split the [1,2] into 5 parts. So each interval has a width h = (2-1)/5 = 0.2. So h is 0.2.

The trapezoidal rule for the integral is (h/2) [f(x0) + 2f(x1) + 2f(x2) + ... + 2f(xn-1) + f(xn)], where n is the number of intervals. So in this case, n=5, so h=0.2.

Wait, but wait again. The function we're integrating is sqrt(1 + x^6). So in the trapezoidal rule, each f(x_i) is the value of sqrt(1 + x_i^6) at each x_i.

So the x values will be from x=1 to x=2, in steps of 0.2. So the x_i values are 1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2.0.

Wait, let me check: n=5, so the points are x0=1, x1=1.2, x2=1.4, x3=1.6, x4=1.8, x5=2.0. So that's 6 points, which makes 5 intervals. Right.

So I need to compute f(x_i) for each i from 0 to 5, then apply the trapezoidal formula.

Let's list the x_i and calculate f(x_i) for each.

x0 = 1.0
f(x0) = sqrt(1 + (1)^6) = sqrt(1 +1) = sqrt(2) ≈ 1.4142

x1 = 1.2
f(x1) = sqrt(1 + (1.2)^6). Let me compute (1.2)^6 first.

Wait, 1.2^2 is 1.44, 1.2^3 is 1.728, 1.2^4 is 2.0736, 1.2^5 is 2.48832, 1.2^6 is approximately 2.985984. So 1 + 2.985984 is about 3.985984. So sqrt(3.985984) ≈ 1.99664.

x2 = 1.4
f(x2) = sqrt(1 + (1.4)^6). Let's compute 1.4^6.

1.4^2 = 1.96, 1.4^3 = 2.744, 1.4^4 = 3.8416, 1.4^5 = 5.37824, 1.4^6 = 7.529536. So 1 + 7.529536 = 8.529536. sqrt of that is approx 2.92106.

x3 = 1.6
f(x3) = sqrt(1 + (1.6)^6). Let's compute 1.6^6.

1.6^2=2.56, 1.6^3=4.096, 1.6^4=6.5536, 1.6^5=10.48576, 1.6^6=16.777056. So 1 +16.777056=17.777056. sqrt of that is about 4.2185.

x4 = 1.8
f(x4)=sqrt(1 + (1.8)^6). Let's compute 1.8^6.

1.8^2=3.24, 1.8^3=5.832, 1.8^4=10.4976, 1.8^5=18.89568, 1.8^6=34.012224. So 1 +34.012224=35.012224. sqrt of that is about 5.9161.

x5=2.0
f(x5)=sqrt(1 + (2)^6)=sqrt(1 +64)=sqrt(65)≈8.0623.

Now, let me list all these f(x_i) values:

f(x0) ≈1.4142
f(x1)≈1.9966
f(x2)≈2.9211
f(x3)≈4.2185
f(x4)≈5.9161
f(x5)≈8.0623

Now, the trapezoidal rule formula for the integral is:

Integral ≈ (h/2) [f(x0) + 2*(f(x1)+f(x2)+f(x3)+f(x4)) + f(x5)]

So h is 0.2, so h/2 is 0.1.

Let me compute the sum inside the brackets:

sum = f(x0) + 2*(f(x1) + f(x2) + f(x3) + f(x4)) ) + f(x5)

Compute each term:

f(x0) = 1.4142
f(x5)=8.0623
The middle terms are 2*(1.9966 + 2.9211 +4.2185 +5.9161)

Let me compute the sum inside the parentheses:

1.9966 + 2.9211 = 4.9177
4.9177 +4.2185 =9.1362
9.1362 +5.9161=15.0523

Multiply by 2: 30.1046

Now sum all terms: 1.4142 + 30.1046 +8.0623 = 1.4142 + 30.1046 is 31.5188, plus 8.0623 gives 39.5811.

So the integral is (0.1) * 39.5811 = 3.95811.

Wait, but wait, the options don't have 3.9581. Let me check the options.

Wait, looking back, the options are:

A:4.322
B:4.875
C:3.672
D:4.489
E:4.050
F:5.236
G:3.814
H:3.958
I:2.568
J:5.104

Oh, option H is 3.958. So that's the answer.

Wait, but wait, did I make a calculation mistake? Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, in the sum, I have:

sum =1.4142 + 2*(1.9966 +2.9211 +4.2185 +5.9161 ) +8.0623

Let me compute each part again.

1.9966 + 2.9211 = 4.9177
4.9177 +4.2185 =9.1362
9.1362 +5.9161 =15.0523

Multiply by 2: 30.1046.

Then sum all three parts: 1.4142 +30.1046 =31.5188, plus 8.0623 gives 39.5811.

Multiply by h/2: 0.1 *39.5811 =3.95811.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer is option H:3.958.

To find the arc length of \( y = \frac{1}{4}x^4 \) over the interval \([1, 2]\) using the Trapezoidal Rule \( T_5 \), we start by noting that the arc length formula is:

\[
\text{Arc Length} = \int_a^b \sqrt{1 + [f'(x)]^2} \, dx
\]

For \( f(x) = \frac{1}{4}x^4 \), the derivative is \( f'(x) = x^3 \). Substituting this into the arc length formula gives:

\[
\text{Arc Length} = \int_1^2 \sqrt{1 + x^6} \, dx
\]

The Trapezoidal Rule \( T_5 \) approximates the integral using \( n = 5 \) subintervals, so the step size is:

\[
h = \frac{b - a}{n} = \frac{2 - 1}{5} = 0.2
\]

The points in the interval are \( x_0 = 1.0, x_1 = 1.2, x_2 = 1.4, x_3 = 1.6, x_4 = 1.8, x_5 = 2.0 \). The function \( f(x) = \sqrt{1 + x^6} \) is evaluated at these points:

\[
\begin{aligned}
f(x_0) &= \sqrt{1 + (1.0)^6} = \sqrt{2} \approx 1.4142, \\
f(x_1) &= \sqrt{1 + (1.2)^6} \approx 1.9966, \\
f(x_2) &= \sqrt{1 + (1.4)^6} \approx 2.9211, \\
f(x_3) &= \sqrt{1 + (1.6)^6} \approx 4.2185, \\
f(x_4) &= \sqrt{1 + (1.8)^6} \approx 5.9161, \\
f(x_5) &= \sqrt{1 + (2.0)^6} = \sqrt{65} \approx 8.0623.
\end{aligned}
\]

The Trapezoidal Rule formula is:

\[
\int_a^b f(x) \, dx \approx \frac{h}{2} \left[ f(x_0) + 2 \sum_{i=1}^{4} f(x_i) + f(x_5) \right]
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\int_1^2 \sqrt{1 + x^6} \, dx \approx \frac{0.2}{2} \left[ 1.4142 + 2(1.9966 + 2.9211 + 4.2185 + 5.9161) + 8.0623 \right]
\]

First, compute the sum inside the brackets:

\[
1.9966 + 2.9211 + 4.2185 + 5.9161 = 15.0523
\]

Multiply by 2:

\[
2(15.0523) = 30.1046
\]

Now add all terms:

\[
1.4142 + 30.1046 + 8.0623 = 39.5811
\]

Finally, multiply by \( \frac{h}{2} = 0.1 \):

\[
\int_1^2 \sqrt{1 + x^6} \, dx \approx 0.1 \times 39.5811 = 3.9581
\]

Thus, the arc length is approximately \( 3.958 \), which corresponds to option **H**.
