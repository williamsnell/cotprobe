Options:

A: EPSP and IPSP are types of nerve cells.

C: EPSP and IPSP are neurotransmitters released by glial cells that do not directly affect nerve cells.
D: EPSP refers to a nerve cell's energy production surge, while IPSP refers to its energy conservation state.
E: EPSP is an inhibitory postsynaptic potential and IPSP is an excitatory postsynaptic potential.
F: An EPSP is a permanent change in nerve cell excitability, while an IPSP is a temporary change that lasts only a few seconds.
G: An EPSP is an excitatory postsynaptic potential making a nerve cell more likely to fire and an IPSP is an inhibitory post synaptic potential making it less likely to fire.
H: EPSP is a protein that enhances nerve growth, and IPSP is a molecule that prevents nerve growth.
I: EPSP increases a nerve cell's excitability by decreasing its membrane potential, while IPSP decreases excitability by increasing the membrane potential.
J: EPSP and IPSP do not affect a nerve cell's excitability.

Okay, so I've got this question about EPSP and IPSP and how they affect a nerve cell's excitability. Hmm, I remember from my biology class that these have something to do with how neurons communicate. Let me think.

I think EPSP stands for Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential and IPSP is Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potential. Right, because neurons send signals through synapses, and these potentials are the results of those signals.

So, what do they do? I remember that when a neuron fires, it releases neurotransmitters into the synapse. These chemicals then bind to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron. Depending on the type of neurotransmitter, it can either excite or inhibit the postsynaptic neuron.

EPSP must be when the neurotransmitter causes the postsynaptic neuron to become more likely to fire an action potential. That makes sense because 'excitatory' sounds like it's encouraging something to happen. So, if the membrane potential becomes less polarized, moving towards the threshold, that's depolarization. EPSPs depolarize the cell, making it more excitable.

On the flip side, IPSP would have the opposite effect. Inhibitory means it's stopping something, so the IPSP should make the neuron less likely to fire. That would involve hyperpolarization, making the membrane potential more negative than the resting state. So, the neuron's excitability decreases because it's further from the threshold needed to fire an action potential.

Wait, I should make sure I'm not mixing up the terms. Let me think again. When a neuron is at resting, it's polarized, with a negative charge inside. An EPSP brings the inside closer to zero by adding positive ions (like sodium), making it easier to reach the action potential threshold. An IPSP does the opposite, making the inside more negative (maybe by opening chloride channels), making it harder to reach threshold.

Looking at the options, let me go through them.

Option G says EPSP is excitatory, making the cell more likely to fire, and IPSP is inhibitory, making it less likely. That matches what I was thinking.

Option E has them reversed, which is incorrect. Option I is tricky—it says EPSP decreases membrane potential, which I think is correct because depolarization is a decrease in the negative potential. But IPSP increases membrane potential, making it more negative. Wait, no, option I says EPSP increases excitability by decreasing the membrane potential. Wait, does it decrease or increase the potential? Let me clarify.

Membrane potential is usually around -70mV. EPSP brings it closer to zero, so the potential becomes less negative—like from -70 to -60. So it's a decrease in the negativity, but the absolute value is lower. So the membrane potential is higher (less negative), moving towards threshold. So, yes, EPSP decreases the membrane potential's negativity, making the cell more excitable. IPSP does the opposite, making it more negative, so higher in negative value, decreasing excitability.

Option I says EPSP increases excitability by decreasing membrane potential. Wait, membrane potential is the voltage. So when it's depolarized, the membrane potential (voltage) becomes higher (less negative). So the membrane potential is increased towards zero. So option I's wording is a bit confusing. It says "EPSP increases... by decreasing its membrane potential." Wait, that's not right because if the membrane potential becomes less negative (e.g., from -70 to -60), the actual value is higher. So the wording in option I might be incorrect. Alternatively, it's phrased as "decreasing" the membrane potential, which could mean making it less negative. So maybe option I is correct in effect but perhaps the wording is confusing. 

But wait, let's look back. Option G says EPSP makes the cell more likely to fire, which is correct. So the correct answer should be G.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me check each option again.

Option G: EPSP is excitatory, making the cell more likely to fire; IPSP is inhibitory, making it less likely. That's correct.

Option I: EPSP increases excitability by decreasing membrane potential. Wait, if the membrane potential is the voltage, making it less negative (decreasing the negative value) is actually an increase in the potential. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused about whether "membrane potential" refers to the absolute value or the actual voltage. Normally, when we talk about membrane potential, a higher value is less negative. So a depolarization (EPSP) increases the membrane potential towards zero, making it more positive. So the membrane potential has increased in value.

Wait, so in terms of the actual voltage, when a neuron is at rest (-70mV), an EPSP brings it to, say, -60mV. So the membrane potential has increased from -70 to -60. So the membrane potential is higher, not lower. So option I says EPSP increases excitability by decreasing the membrane potential. That would be incorrect because EPSP increases the membrane potential (makes it less negative). So option I is wrong.

Option G is correct. So the answer is G.

An EPSP (Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential) occurs when a neurotransmitter binds to the postsynaptic neuron and causes depolarization, making the membrane potential less negative and increasing the likelihood of the neuron firing an action potential. Conversely, an IPSP (Inhibitory Postsynaptic Potential) occurs when a neurotransmitter causes hyperpolarization, making the membrane potential more negative and decreasing the likelihood of the neuron firing an action potential.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option G** correctly states that EPSP is excitatory, making the cell more likely to fire, and IPSP is inhibitory, making it less likely. This aligns with the biological functions of EPSP and IPSP.
- **Option I** incorrectly describes the effect of EPSP on membrane potential. While EPSP does increase excitability, it does so by increasing the membrane potential (making it less negative), not decreasing it. This makes Option I incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**G: An EPSP is an excitatory postsynaptic potential making a nerve cell more likely to fire and an IPSP is an inhibitory postsynaptic potential making it less likely to fire.**

Answer: G
