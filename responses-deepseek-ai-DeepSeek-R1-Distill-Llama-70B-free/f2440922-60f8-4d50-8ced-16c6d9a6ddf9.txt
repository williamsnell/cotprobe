Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the vibrational energy levels of the HCl molecule. The question says that the spacing between these energy levels is 0.36 eV, and I need to find the effective force constant in N/m. Hmm, I remember that vibrational energy levels are quantized and related to the force constant. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

I think the energy levels for a quantum harmonic oscillator are given by E_n = (n + 1/2) h f, where n is the quantum number, h is Planck's constant, and f is the frequency. But wait, the spacing between levels would be the difference between E_n and E_{n+1}, right? So the spacing ΔE is E_{n+1} - E_n, which is just h f. Oh wait, no, that's not right. Because E_n is (n + 1/2) h f, so the next level is (n+1 + 1/2) h f. So the difference is h f. So the spacing is h times the frequency.

But wait, the question gives the spacing in eV. Oh right, so I can set h f = 0.36 eV. So I need to find f, the frequency, from that equation, and then relate frequency to the force constant.

I remember that for a diatomic molecule, the vibrational frequency f is related to the force constant k and the reduced mass μ by the formula f = (1/(2π)) sqrt(k/μ). So rearranging that, k = (2π f)^2 μ.

So I need to find f first. Because h f = 0.36 eV. So f = 0.36 eV / h. But wait, I need to make sure the units work out. Let me think about the units.

Planck's constant h is in J·s. 1 eV is 1.602 x 10^-19 J. So 0.36 eV is 0.36 * 1.602e-19 J. So h is 6.626e-34 J·s. So f = (0.36 eV) / h, but I need to compute this in Hz, which is 1/s.

Wait, let me plug in the numbers. So 0.36 eV is 0.36 * 1.602e-19 J, which is approximately 5.767e-20 J. Then f = (5.767e-20 J) / (6.626e-34 J·s) ). Let me calculate that: 5.767e-20 / 6.626e-34 = approx 8.7e13 Hz. Hmm, that seems really high. Wait, but molecular vibrations are typically in the terahertz range, right? So that seems about right.

But wait, I'm not sure if I should use h or h-bar here. Oh wait, because the energy spacing is h f, not h-bar. So yes, it's h f.

Wait, but in the formula, E = (n + 1/2) h f. So the difference between levels is h f. So yes, ΔE = h f. So f = ΔE / h.

So f is 0.36 eV divided by h. But wait, the units: eV is in energy, h is in J·s. So I'll convert 0.36 eV to Joules first. 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J, so 0.36 eV is 0.36 * 1.602e-19 = 5.7672e-20 J.

Now f = 5.7672e-20 J / (6.626e-34 J·s) = (5.7672 / 6.626) * 1e14. Let me compute 5.7672 /6.626. 5.7672 ÷6.626 ≈ 0.8705. So f ≈ 0.8705e14 Hz, which is 8.705e13 Hz.

Now, I need to calculate the force constant k. The formula is k = (2π f)^2 * μ, where μ is the reduced mass.

So first, compute (2π f)^2. f is 8.705e13 Hz. 2π is about 6.2832. So 6.2832 * 8.705e13 = let's compute that. 6 * 8.7e13 is 5.22e14, 0.2832 *8.7e13≈ 2.46e13. So total ≈5.22e14 + 0.246e14 = 5.466e14 rad/s. Then (5.466e14)^2 is (5.466)^2 * 1e28. 5.466 squared is approx 29.86. So 29.86e28 (rad²/s²) = 2.986e29.

Wait, but I should do it more accurately. Let me compute 2πf first.

2π * 8.705e13 = 6.2832 * 8.705e13. Let's compute 6 * 8.705e13 = 5.223e14. 0.2832 *8.705e13: 0.2832 *8.705 = approx 2.469, so 2.469e13. So total is 5.223e14 + 2.469e13 = 5.4695e14. So squared is (5.4695e14)^2 = (5.4695)^2 * (1e14)^2. 5.4695 squared is about 29.89. So 29.89e28 = 2.989e29 (rad/s)^2.

Now, multiply by the reduced mass μ. What's the reduced mass of HCl? H is approximately 1 atomic mass unit, Cl is about 35.45 amu. Wait, more precisely, H is 1.00784 amu, Cl is 34.96885 amu.

The reduced mass μ is (m1 * m2)/(m1 + m2). So in kg, because 1 amu is 1.6605e-27 kg. So m_H = 1.00784 * 1.6605e-27 kg, m_Cl = 34.96885 *1.6605e-27 kg.

Compute μ:

μ = (m_H * m_Cl) / (m_H + m_Cl).

So m_H = 1.00784 * 1.6605e-27 ≈ let's compute 1.00784 * 1.6605e-27. 1.00784 *1.6605 ≈ 1.673 (since 1 *1.66 is 1.66, 0.00784 *1.66≈0.013, total ≈1.673). So m_H ≈1.673e-27 kg.

m_Cl = 34.96885 * 1.6605e-27. Let's compute 35 *1.66=58.1, but more accurately: 34.96885 *1.6605≈ let's see:

34 *1.6605 = 56.457, 0.96885 *1.6605 ≈1.608. So total ≈56.457 +1.608=58.065. So m_Cl ≈58.065e-27 kg? Wait, no, wait. No, 34.96885 *1.6605e-27 kg. So 34.96885 *1.6605 ≈58.065, so m_Cl=58.065e-27 kg.

So m_H =1.673e-27 kg, m_Cl=58.065e-27 kg.

μ = (1.673e-27 *58.065e-27) / (1.673e-27 +58.065e-27).

Compute numerator: 1.673 *58.065 = let's calculate. 1.673 *50=83.65, 1.673 *8.065≈13.48. So 83.65 +13.48≈97.13. So numerator≈97.13e-54 kg².

Denominator: (1.673 +58.065)e-27 =59.738e-27 kg.

So μ≈ (97.13e-54) / (59.738e-27) ) = (97.13 /59.738 ) *1e-27 kg.

97.13 /59.738 is approximately 1.626. So μ≈1.626e-27 kg.

Wait, let me double-check the math. Because 1.673 *58.065 = let's compute it more accurately.

1.673 *58.065 = 1.673*(50 +8.065) = 1.673*50=83.65, 1.673*8=13.384, 1.673*0.065≈0.1086. So 83.65 +13.384=97.034 +0.1086=97.1426. So numerator is 97.1426e-54.

Denominator: 1.673 +58.065 =59.738, so 59.738e-27.

μ=97.1426e-54 /59.738e-27 = (97.1426 /59.738) * 1e-27.

Calculate 97.1426 /59.738 ≈ 1.626.

So μ≈1.626e-27 kg.

Now, back to k = (2π f)^2 * μ.

We have (2π f)^2 ≈2.989e29 (rad/s)^2.

So k =2.989e29 *1.626e-27 = (2.989 *1.626) *1e2.

Compute 2.989 *1.626:

2 *1.626=3.252, 0.989*1.626≈1.608. So total≈3.252 +1.608=4.86.

So 4.86 *1e2 =486 N/m.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. The options are A:450, B:550, etc. The closest option is H:490.0 or J:420, but wait, 486 is near 480. Hmm, but perhaps I made a mistake in calculations somewhere.

Wait, let me check the calculations again.

First, the energy spacing: 0.36 eV is correct. Converted to J, that's 0.36 *1.602e-19 =5.7672e-20 J.

Then f = 5.7672e-20 /6.626e-34 = approx 8.705e13 Hz. Yes.

Then 2pi f is 5.4695e14 rad/s, squared is (5.4695e14)^2 = 29.89e28 => 2.989e29.

Reduced mass calculation: H is 1.00784 amu, Cl is 34.96885 amu.

m_H =1.00784 *1.6605e-27 =1.673e-27 kg.

m_Cl=34.96885 *1.6605e-27=58.065e-27 kg.

μ=(1.673e-27 *58.065e-27)/(1.673e-27 +58.065e-27) = (97.13e-54)/(59.738e-27) )=1.626e-27 kg.

So k = (2.989e29) * (1.626e-27 )= 4.86e2 N/m, which is 486 N/m.

Looking at the options, option H is 490, which is close. But wait, perhaps I made an approximation error.

Wait, let me compute (2pi f)^2 more accurately. f=8.705e13 Hz.

2pi f= 2 *3.1416 *8.705e13 =6.2832 *8.705e13 = let's compute 6 *8.705e13=5.223e14, 0.2832 *8.705e13= 2.469e13, total 5.4695e14. Square is (5.4695e14)^2= (5.4695)^2 *1e28.

5.4695^2: 5^2=25, 0.4695^2≈0.2204, cross terms 2*5*0.4695=4.695. So 25 +4.695 +0.2204≈29.915. So 2.9915e29.

So k=2.9915e29 *1.626e-27= (2.9915 *1.626 ) *1e2.

Compute 2.9915 *1.626:

Let me compute 3 *1.626=4.878, subtract 0.0085 *1.626= approx 0.0138. So 4.878 -0.0138=4.8642.

So 4.8642e2 N/m=486.42 N/m.

So approximately 486 N/m. The options don't have 486. The options are A:450, B:550, C:300, D:520, E:600, F:200, G:350, H:490, I:575, J:420.

So 486 is closest to 490, which is option H. But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check the reduced mass calculation more precisely.

Wait, m_H =1.00784 amu *1.6605e-27 kg/amu =1.00784 *1.6605e-27= let's compute 1.00784 *1.6605.

1 *1.6605=1.6605, 0.00784 *1.6605≈0.0130. So total≈1.6735e-27 kg.

m_Cl=34.96885 *1.6605e-27= let's compute 34.96885 *1.6605.

34 *1.6605=56.457, 0.96885 *1.6605≈1.608 (as before). So 56.457 +1.608=58.065. So 58.065e-27 kg.

μ= (1.6735e-27 *58.065e-27) / (1.6735e-27 +58.065e-27) = (1.6735 *58.065) e-54 / (59.738) e-27.

1.6735 *58.065 = let's compute this accurately.

Hmm, 1.6735 *58.065.

Perhaps it's better to compute 1.6735 *58.065:

1.6735 *50=83.675.

1.6735 *8=13.388.

1.6735 *0.065=0.1089.

Adding them up: 83.675 +13.388=97.063 +0.1089=97.1719.

So numerator is 97.1719e-54, denominator 59.738e-27.

So μ=97.1719e-54 /59.738e-27 = (97.1719 /59.738) *1e-27.

Compute 97.1719 /59.738.

59.738 *1.6 =95.5808. 97.1719-95.5808=1.5911.

So 1.6 + (1.5911/59.738) ≈1.6 +0.0266≈1.6266.

So μ≈1.6266e-27 kg.

So k=(2pi f)^2 * mu = (2.9915e29) *1.6266e-27.

So 2.9915 *1.6266 ≈4.865e2.

Wait, 2.9915 *1.6266:

2 *1.6266=3.2532.

0.9915 *1.6266= approx 1.612.

So total≈3.2532 +1.612=4.8652.

So 4.8652e2 N/m=486.52 N/m.

Hmm, but the options don't have 486. The closest is H:490.0. So perhaps the answer is H.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the energy spacing. Let me think again. The energy spacing is given as 0.36 eV. Oh wait, but vibrational energy levels are quantized as E_n = (n + 1/2) h f. So the spacing is h f, right? So the calculation seems correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the question uses the angular frequency ω instead of f. Because sometimes the formula is written as E = (n + 1/2) ħ ω, where ħ is h-bar. So in that case, the spacing would be ħ ω, not h f. Wait, let me make sure.

Yes, the energy levels can also be written as E_n = (n + 1/2) ħ ω, where ω is the angular frequency. And ω = 2 pi f. So if the spacing is given by ΔE = ħ ω, then ω = ΔE / ħ.

But wait, earlier I used f, not ω. So if the question gives the spacing as h f, but perhaps it's actually h-bar omega.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify.

The two approaches:

Approach 1: E_n = (n + 1/2) h f → ΔE = h f.

Approach 2: E_n = (n + 1/2) ħ ω → ΔE = ħ ω.

So in approach 1, f is the frequency, and in approach 2, ω is the angular frequency.

Which one is correct?

Well, both are correct, but the relation between f and ω is ω = 2 pi f.

So when the energy spacing is given as 0.36 eV, it's either h f or ħ ω.

Wait, but wait, in quantum mechanics, the formula is E = ħ ω (n + 1/2). So the spacing between adjacent levels is E_{n+1} - E_n = ħ ω (n+1 +1/2 - (n +1/2 )) ) = ħ ω. So the spacing is ħ ω.

So in this case, 0.36 eV = ħ ω.
