Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about a Michelson interferometer. Hmm, I remember that a Michelson interferometer splits light into two paths, one with a stationary mirror and the other with a mirror that can move, or in this case, has a gas cell. When the light from both paths recombines, it creates an interference pattern, like fringes.

The question says that the gas cell has an optical path length of 10 cm. Wait, optical path length is the product of the physical length and the refractive index, right? So optical path length (OPL) = n * L, where L is the physical length. Oh wait, but in this case, the cell is placed in one arm, so the OPL for that arm would be n * L, while the other arm is just in air, so its OPL is L0 = L (since n for air is approximately 1, but maybe for more precision, it's slightly more than 1. But maybe in this problem, we can treat air as n=1. I'll have to see.)

The light source is a laser with wavelength 632.2 nm. That's the He-Ne laser wavelength, I think. So lambda is 632.2 nm, which is 632.2e-9 meters.

They counted 100 fringes as the gas cell was evacuated. So when the gas is removed, the cell becomes empty, which I guess has a refractive index of 1 (since vacuum is 1). So the original gas had a higher refractive index than 1, but as it's evacuated, the index decreases to 1.

Wait, but wait. Let me think: the gas is being removed, so the refractive index of the gas in the cell is changing from n to 1. So initially, the OPL was n * L, and then it becomes L (since n=1 for vacuum). So the change in OPL is from n * L to L. So the difference is (n-1)*L.

But wait, the way the interferometer works is that when the OPL in one arm changes, it causes a phase shift, which leads to fringes moving. Each fringe corresponds to a change in OPL of half a wavelength, because that's how interference works: a change of lambda/2 causes a shift from constructive to destructive, etc.

So when the gas is evacuated, the OPL decreases by (n-1)*L. Because initially, OPL was n*L, and then it's 1*L. So the change delta_OPL is (n-1)*L.

The number of fringes counted is 100. Each fringe corresponds to a change of lambda/2 in OPL. So the total change in OPL is number_of_fringes * lambda / 2.

Wait, but wait: actually, in a Michelson interferometer, when you change the OPL in one arm, the number of fringes that shift is equal to the change in OPL divided by lambda/2. Because each lambda/2 change causes one fringe shift.

So the formula would be: number_of_fringes = (delta_OPL) / (lambda / 2) = 2 * delta_OPL / lambda.

So delta_OPL is (n-1) * L. Because when you evacuate, the OPL decreases by (n-1)L.

Wait, but let me double-check. Suppose the initial OPL is n*L, and after evacuation it's L, so the change is (n*L - L) = (n-1)L, but since it's being evacuated, the OPL is decreasing, which would cause the fringes to shift. But the formula for the number of fringes observed is the change in OPL divided by lambda/2. So N = delta_OPL / (lambda/2).

So substituting:

N = [ (n-1)*L ] / (lambda/2 )

We can solve for (n-1):

n-1 = (N * lambda ) / (2 L )

So n = 1 + (N * lambda ) / (2 L )

Wait, wait, let me make sure. So N is the number of fringes. Since each fringe corresponds to lambda/2 change. So for N fringes, delta_OPL is N*(lambda/2). So:

delta_OPL = N*(lambda/2 )

But delta_OPL is (n-1)*L, so:

(n-1)*L = N*(lambda/2 )

Solving for n:

n = 1 + (N * lambda )/(2 L )

Okay, that makes sense. So plugging in the numbers:

N = 100 fringes.

lambda is 632.2 nm = 632.2e-9 meters.

L is 10 cm = 0.1 meters.

So:

n = 1 + (100 * 632.2e-9 ) / (2 * 0.1 )

Let me compute the numerator and denominator.

Numerator: 100 * 632.2e-9 = 6.322e-5 meters.

Denominator: 2 * 0.1 = 0.2 meters.

So (6.322e-5) / 0.2 = 6.322e-5 / 2e-1 = 3.161e-4.

So n = 1 + 3.161e-4 = 1.0003161.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.00032, which is very close. But wait, let me compute more accurately.

Wait, 100 * 632.2e-9 = 6322e-8 = 632.2e-6 meters.

Wait, no, 100 * 632.2e-9 = 63220e-9 = 6.322e-5 meters.

Denominator: 2 * 0.1 = 0.2.

So 6.322e-5 / 0.2 = (6.322 / 0.2) * 1e-5 = 31.61 * 1e-5 = 3.161e-4.

So n = 1 + 0.0003161 = 1.0003161.

Looking at the options, option A is 1.00032, and option C is 1.00047. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the numbers.

Wait, 632.2e-9 meters is 632.2 nm. Let me write it as 632.2 x 10^-9 m.

So 100 * 632.2e-9 = 63220e-9 = 6.322e-5 m.

Divide by 0.2 m: 6.322e-5 / 0.2 = (6.322 / 0.2) * 1e-5.

6.322 / 0.2 is 31.61, so 31.61e-5, which is 3.161e-4.

So 3.161e-4 is 0.0003161, so n is 1.0003161.

Looking at the options, the closest is A: 1.00032.

But wait, perhaps I should consider that the wavelength is measured in vacuum, but the gas cell's change in OPL is in the medium. Hmm, but in the formula I used, the delta_OPL is (n-1)L, which is because when the gas is present, the OPL is nL, and when it's evacuated, it's L. So the change is (nL - L) = (n-1)L.

Wait, but wait another thing. When the gas is present, the physical length is L, but the optical path length is nL. When you evacuate the gas, it's L in a vacuum (n=1), so OPL is L. So the change in OPL is (nL - L) = (n-1)L. So that part is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think in terms of the number of wavelengths, but I don't think that affects the calculation.

Wait, maybe the formula is n=1 + (2 N lambda)/(L). Let me check.

Wait, the formula I have is N = (2 (n-1) L)/lambda.

Wait, because each fringe corresponds to half a wavelength change. So delta_OPL = N * (lambda/2), which is (n-1)L = N (lambda/2) → n-1 = (N lambda)/(2 L) → n=1 + (N lambda)/(2 L).

So that's correct.

So plugging the numbers again:

lambda = 632.2e-9 meters.

N=100.

L=0.1 meters.

n=1 + (100 * 632.2e-9 ) / (2 * 0.1 )

=1 + (63220e-9) / 0.2

Wait, 100*632.2 = 63220 → 63220e-9 = 6.322e-5 meters.

Divide by 0.2 → 6.322e-5 / 0.2 = 3.161e-4.

So n=1.0003161, which is approximately 1.00032. So option A.

But wait, the options don’t have exactly that. Option A is 1.00032, which is 3.2e-4. My calculation gives 3.161e-4, which is 0.3161% → 1.0003161.

So perhaps the intended answer is option C?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute it again.

Compute 100 * 632.2e-9 = 63220e-9 = 6.322e-5 m.

Denominator is 2 * 0.1 = 0.2 m.

So 6.322e-5 / 0.2 → 6.322e-5 divided by 2e-1 → (6.322 / 2) * 1e-4 → 3.161 * 1e-4 → 0.0003161.

So n=1 + 0.0003161 = 1.0003161.

Looking at the options, let me list them:

A: 1.00032 → 0.00032 → 3.2e-4.

B: 1.00063 → 6.3e-4.

C: 1.00047 → 4.7e-4.

D: 1.00052 → 5.2e-4.

E: 1.00001 → 1e-5.

F: 0.99957 → below 1, so if n is less than 1, which would mean the gas has lower refractive index than vacuum, which it can't be because gases have n>1 but very close to 1. So F is 0.99957, which is less than 1, so probably not the right answer.

So option A is 1.00032, which is 0.00032. My calculation was 0.0003161, which is 3.161e-4, which is very close to 3.2e-4. So option A is the closest.

Wait, but why would the options include C as 1.00047? Maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait another approach: the formula for the number of fringes when changing the refractive index is N = (2*(n-1)*L)/lambda.

Wait, that can't be right because the formula I used earlier is correct. Let me think.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the light passes through the gas cell twice? Because in a Michelson interferometer, the light goes into the cell, reflects off a mirror, and comes back. So the path length through the cell is 2L, not L.

Wait, wait a minute. Oh wait, the cell is placed in one arm. So when the light goes into the cell, it travels through the cell twice—once going in, once coming back after reflection. So the optical path difference would be 2*(n-1)*L, because the physical path is 2L (since the light goes through the cell twice), and the OPL is 2nL, while the other arm is 2L (assuming it's in air, n=1).

Wait, that changes things. So delta_OPL is 2(n-1)L.

So when the gas is evacuated, the OPL changes by 2(n-1)L. So the number of fringes would be N = delta_OPL / (lambda/2) = [2(n-1)L]/(lambda/2) ) = 4(n-1)L/lambda.

Wait, so solving for n-1:

n-1 = (N * lambda) / (4 L )

So that would change the formula.

Wait, if I made a mistake in considering the path length, that would explain the discrepancy. Let me think again.

In a Michelson interferometer, each arm reflects once. So the light in the arm with the cell goes through the cell once on the way to the mirror and once on the way back. So it's 2L in physical length, but the OPL is 2nL. The other arm is, let's say, in air, so OPL is 2L.

So the initial OPL difference is 2nL - 2L = 2(n-1)L.

When the gas is evacuated, the OPL becomes 2L in both arms, so the change in OPL is 2(n-1)L.

So the change in OPL that causes the fringes is 2(n-1)L.

Each fringe corresponds to a change in OPL of lambda/2.

So N = (change in OPL) / (lambda/2) = [2(n-1)L]/(lambda/2) ) = 4(n-1)L/(lambda )

So n-1 = (N * lambda )/(4 L )

So n = 1 + (N lambda )/(4 L )

Ah, so my initial formula missed the factor of 2 because the light passes through the cell twice. So that's why my previous calculation was off.

So let's recalculate using this corrected formula.

N=100, lambda=632.2e-9 m, L=0.1 m.

n = 1 + (100 * 632.2e-9 )/(4 * 0.1 )

Compute denominator: 4 * 0.1 = 0.4.

Numerator: 100 * 632.2e-9 = 6.322e-5.

So (6.322e-5) / 0.4 = (6.322 /0.4 )e-5.

6.322 / 0.4 = 15.805 → so 15.805e-5 = 1.5805e-4.

So n = 1 + 0.00015805 = 1.00015805.

Wait, but that would give n ≈ 1.00016. Looking at the options, option G is 1.00016.

Hmm, but earlier without considering the double pass, I got 1.00032 (option A), which was one of the choices. But now with the double pass it's 1.00016, which is option G.

Wait, but why would the light pass through the cell twice? Because in a Michelson interferometer, the beam splitter sends light to both mirrors. So each arm's light reflects once, so the path length in each arm is twice the physical length of the arm. So if the cell is placed in one arm, the light in that arm passes through the cell twice, so the OPL is 2nL. But wait, the problem says that the cell has an optical path length of 10 cm. Wait, does that mean that the OPL is 10 cm (0.1 m) regardless of n? Or is the physical length 10 cm, and the OPL is n*10 cm?

Wait, the question states: "a gas cell with an optical path length of 10 cm". Hmm, that's a bit ambiguous. Optical path length is n times physical length. So if the cell's OPL is 10 cm, then n * L = 10 cm. But without knowing L, that's not helpful. Wait, but perhaps the physical length is 10 cm, making the OPL n * 10 cm. Because the problem says the gas cell has an optical path length of 10 cm. Wait, that would mean that OPL = n * L = 10 cm. So if the cell is filled with a gas of refractive index n, then the OPL is 10 cm. But that's only for the gas-filled case. When evacuated, OPL would be 1 * L, but L is not given. Hmm, perhaps that's a different approach.

Wait, maybe the problem assumes that the physical length is 10 cm, so L=0.1 m. So when filled with gas, OPL is n * 0.1 m. When evacuated, OPL is 0.1 m.

So the change in OPL is (n-1)*0.1 m. But in the interferometer, the beam passes through the cell twice, so the total change is 2*(n-1)*0.1 m.

So delta_OPL = 2*(n-1)*0.1 m.

So number of fringes N = delta_OPL / (lambda/2) = [2*(n-1)*0.1] / (lambda/2 )

= (0.2 (n-1)) / (lambda/2 )

= (0.2 * 2 (n-1)) ) / lambda

= 0.4 (n-1) / lambda.

So N = 0.4 (n-1)/lambda.

So solving for n:

n = 1 + (N * lambda ) / 0.4.

Wait, that's different again. Let me plug in the numbers.

N=100.

lambda=632.2e-9 m.

n=1 + (100 * 632.2e-9 ) / 0.4.

Compute numerator: 100 * 632.2e-9 = 6.322e-5.

Denominator: 0.4 → 6.322e-5 / 0.4 = 1.5805e-4.

So n=1 + 0.00015805 = 1.00015805. So approximately 1.00016.

Looking at the options, option G is 1.00016. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but earlier when I considered double pass (twice through the cell), I arrived at this figure. So why the confusion?

I think the key is whether the gas cell's optical path length is given as 10 cm. If the physical length of the cell is 10 cm, then the OPL is n * 0.
