Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I need to figure out which statement is false. Let me see... The options are from A to G. Hmm, each option is a comparison between two numbers. I guess I'll need to evaluate each one to see if it's true or false.

Let me start by going through each option one by one. 

Option A: 5 > 3. Well, 5 is definitely greater than 3, so that's true. So A is not the false statement.

Option B: 10 < 20. Yeah, 10 is less than 20, so B is true. Not the one we're looking for.

Option C: −3 > −5. Hmm, negative numbers can be tricky. I remember that as numbers get more negative, they are actually smaller. So -3 is to the right of -5 on the number line, which means -3 is greater than -5. So C is true.

Option D: 3 < 5. That's obviously true since 3 is less than 5. So D is correct, not the false one.

Option E: -10 < -5. Wait, since -10 is further left on the number line than -5, it's the smaller number. So yes, -10 is less than -5. So E is true.

Option F: 0 > -1. Zero is definitely greater than -1 because it's to the right on the number line. So F is true.

Option G: −5 > −3. Now, this is the tricky one. I remember that when comparing negatives, the one with the smaller absolute value is larger. So -5 has a larger absolute value than -3. Wait, no, wait. No, actually, -5 is to the left of -3 on the number line, so -5 is less than -3. So the statement G says -5 is greater than -3, which would be false because -5 is actually smaller. 

So putting it all together, all options except G are true. So the false statement is G.

The false statement is G because -5 is less than -3.

Answer: G
