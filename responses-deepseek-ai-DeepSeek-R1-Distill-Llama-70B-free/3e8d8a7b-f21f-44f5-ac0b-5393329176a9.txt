Okay, so I've got this problem here about shipping a washing machine. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

The question says that ABC Trucking Company charges a rate of $0.084 per pound to transport equipment from New York City to Albany. I need to find out how much they would charge to ship a 275-pound washing machine. 

Hmm, okay, so the rate is 0.084 dollars per pound. That means for each pound, they charge 8.4 cents. So to find the total cost, I should multiply the rate by the weight of the washing machine. 

Wait, let's make sure I'm doing this right. The rate is per pound, so total cost = rate per pound × weight in pounds. So that would be 0.084 multiplied by 275. 

Let me do the multiplication. 275 times 0.084. Hmm, breaking it down might help. Let's think of 275 as 200 + 75. 

First, 200 × 0.084. Well, 200 × 0.08 is 16, and 200 × 0.004 is 0.8. So 16 + 0.8 equals 16.8. 

Next, 75 × 0.084. Let's break that down too. 75 × 0.08 is 6, and 75 × 0.004 is 0.3. So 6 + 0.3 is 6.3. 

Now, adding the two parts together: 16.8 + 6.3 equals 23.1. So the total cost should be $23.10. 

Wait, let me double-check that. Alternatively, I could multiply 275 × 0.084 directly. Let's see: 275 × 84 is... let me calculate that. 

275 × 80 is 22,000. 275 × 4 is 1,100. So 22,000 + 1,100 is 23,100. Oh wait, wait a second—that's in cents because the rate is in dollars per pound. So 23,100 cents. To convert that to dollars, I divide by 100, which gives me 231.00 dollars? Wait, that can't be right because earlier I got 23.10. Did I make a mistake here?

Oh, wait! I think I messed up the decimal places. Because 0.084 is 8.4 cents per pound. So when I multiply 275 × 0.084, it's 23.1 dollars. But when I did 275 × 84, that's 23,100 cents, which is 231 dollars. Oh wait, no, wait. Because 0.084 is 84 thousandths, so when I multiply 275 × 84, that's 23,100, but since 0.084 is 84/1000, I have to divide by 1000 as well. So 23,100 divided by 1000 is 23.1 dollars. Oh, okay, that makes sense. So the total is $23.10.

Looking at the options, option E is $23.10. So that should be the correct answer.

The total cost to ship a 275-pound washing machine at a rate of $0.084 per pound is calculated by multiplying the weight by the rate:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 275 \times 0.084 = 23.10
\]

Thus, the correct answer is **E: $23.10**.
