Okay, so I've got this problem to solve. Let me read it carefully. The question is about counting atoms in a water droplet. Hmm, I've heard that atoms are really small, so this might involve some big numbers. Let's see.

The problem says: At a counting rate of 5 atoms per second, how long would it take to count the atoms in a spherical droplet of water 0.1 cm in diameter? Oh wait, the question is a bit messed up because of a typo, but I think I get the gist. It's a water droplet with a diameter of 0.1 cm. So I need to find the time it takes to count all the atoms in that droplet if I can count 5 atoms each second.

Alright, step by step. First, I think I need to find the volume of the droplet because the number of atoms depends on the volume. The droplet is spherical, so the volume formula is (4/3)πr³. Oh wait, diameter is 0.1 cm, so radius is half of that, 0.05 cm. But wait, I should probably convert that into meters because standard SI units would make calculations easier. Wait, maybe centimeters are okay as long as I'm consistent with units later. Or maybe it's easier to convert to meters now. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: Since we're dealing with water, we can find the number of molecules using the density and molar mass. Oh right! Density is mass per volume, and molar mass relates mass to moles (which relates to molecules via Avogadro's number).

Let me outline the steps I need to take:

1. Calculate the volume of the droplet.
2. Find the mass of the water in the droplet using its density.
3. Convert that mass into moles.
4. Use Avogadro's number to find the number of water molecules.
5. Since each molecule is made of atoms (H and O), calculate the total number of atoms. Wait, wait, water is H2O, so each molecule has 3 atoms (2 H and 1 O). So the total atoms would be 3 times the number of molecules.
6. Finally, divide the total number of atoms by the counting rate (5 per second) to get the time in seconds. Then convert that into years.

Okay, let's go through each step.

Step 1: Volume of the droplet.

Diameter is 0.1 cm, so radius r = 0.05 cm. But I should convert cm to meters. 1 cm is 0.01 meters, so 0.05 cm is 0.005 meters? Wait, no. 0.05 cm is 0.05 * 0.01 m = 0.0005 m. Right.

Volume V = (4/3)πr³. So r is 0.0005 m.

Calculating r³: (0.0005)^3 = 1.25e-13 m³.

Multiply by 4/3 π: 4/3 is about 1.3333, π is about 3.1416, so 1.3333 *3.1416 ≈4.1888.

So V ≈4.1888 * 1.25e-13 = 5.236e-13 m³.

Wait, let me calculate that again more accurately. Let me compute 0.0005^3:

0.0005 = 5e-4. So (5e-4)^3 = 125e-12 = 1.25e-10 m³? Wait no, (5e-4)^3 is (5)^3 * (1e-4)^3) → 125 * 1e-12 → 1.25e-10 m³.

Wait wait, no. Because 1e-4 cubed is 1e-12. So 5e-4 cubed is (5^3)*(1e-4)^3) = 125e-12 = 1.25e-10 m³.

So V = (4/3)π * (0.0005)^3 = (4/3)*π*(1.25e-10) → 4/3 is approx 1.333, 1.333 * 3.1416 ≈ 4.1888.

4.1888 * 1.25e-10 = 5.236e-10 m³. Wait, wait, 1.25e-10 times 4.1888 is 5.236e-10 m³. So V≈5.236e-10 m³.

Wait, but wait a second, I think I made a mistake in the radius calculation. Oh no! Because 0.1 cm diameter is 0.1 cm, radius is 0.05 cm, which is 0.005 meters, not 0.0005. Oops! Because 1 cm is 0.01 m, so 0.05 cm is 0.05 * 0.01 = 0.0005 m. So radius is 0.0005 m. So r^3 is (0.0005)^3 = 1.25e-13 m³.

So V = (4/3)π * 1.25e-13 = approx 5.236e-13 m³.

Wait, yes, because 0.0005 is 5e-4, so cubed is 125e-12 → 1.25e-10? Wait wait, 5e-4 is 0.0005. (5e-4)^3 = 125e-12 → 1.25e-10 m³. So that's correct.

Wait no, 5e-4 is 0.0005. So (5e-4)^3 = 125e-12 → 1.25e-10 m³.

So V = (4/3) * π * 1.25e-10 ≈ 5.236e-10 m³.

Wait, but 1.25e-10 times 4.1888 is about 5.236e-10. Correct.

Step 2: Mass of the water.

Density of water is about 1000 kg/m³. So mass m = density * volume = 1000 kg/m³ * 5.236e-10 m³.

So m = 5.236e-7 kg.

Wait, 1e3 kg/m³ * 5.236e-10 m³ = 5.236e-7 kg. Yes.

Step 3: Moles of water.

Molar mass of water (H2O) is about 18.015 g/mol, which is 0.018015 kg/mol.

So moles n = mass / molar mass = 5.236e-7 kg / 0.018015 kg/mol.

Let me calculate that. 5.236e-7 / 0.018015 ≈ (5.236 / 18.015) )e-7 / 1 → Wait, 5.236e-7 divided by 0.018015 is same as 5.236e-7 / 1.8015e-2 = (5.236 / 1.8015) )e-5.

5.236 divided by about 1.8 is approximately 2.91. So n ≈ 2.91e-5 moles.

Wait, let me compute more accurately. 5.236e-7 kg divided by 0.018015 kg/mol:

5.236e-7 / 0.018015 = (5.236 / 18.015) ) * 1e-7 / 1e-2 → 0.2905 * 1e-5 → 2.905e-6 mol.

Wait, no, wait a second. 0.018015 kg/mol is 18.015 g/mol. So 5.236e-7 kg is 5.236e-4 grams. Because 1 kg is 1e3 grams, so 5.236e-7 kg = 5.236e-4 grams.

Wait, no: 1 kg = 1000 g, so 5.236e-7 kg * 1000 g/kg = 5.236e-4 grams.

So moles n = mass (g) / molar mass (g/mol) → 5.236e-4 g / 18.015 g/mol ≈ 2.905e-5 mol.

Wait, 5.236e-4 / 18.015 → let's compute 5.236e-4 / 18.015.

Well, 5e-4 / 18 is approximately (5/18) * 1e-4 → 0.2778e-4 → 2.778e-5.

So 5.236e-4 / 18.015 ≈ 2.905e-5 mol. So approximately 2.905e-5 moles.

Step 4: Number of molecules.

Avogadro's number is 6.022e23 molecules/mol. So number of molecules = n * Avogadro.

So 2.905e-5 mol * 6.022e23 molecules/mol = 2.905e-5 * 6.022e23.

Multiply 2.905 and 6.022 → approx 17.51, and exponents: 1e-5 * 1e23 = 1e18.

So 17.51e18 → 1.751e19 molecules.

Wait, let me compute more accurately: 2.905e-5 * 6.022e23 = (2.905 * 6.022) )e( -5 +23 ) = let's compute 2.905 *6.022.

2.9 *6=17.4, 0.005 *6=0.03 → 2.9*6.022= 17.4638, 0.005 *6.022=0.03011 → total 17.4939. So 17.494e18 → 1.7494e19 molecules.

So approximately 1.75e19 water molecules.

Step 5: Number of atoms.

Each water molecule has 3 atoms (2 H, 1 O). So total atoms = 3 * 1.75e19 = 5.25e19 atoms.

Wait, 1.75e19 *3 is 5.25e19.

So total atoms to count: 5.25e19.

Step 6: Time to count them.

Counting rate is 5 atoms per second. So time in seconds is total atoms / rate.

Time = 5.25e19 atoms / 5 atoms/sec = 1.05e19 seconds.

Now, convert seconds into years.

I remember that 1 year is about 3.154e7 seconds (60 sec *60 min *24 hr *365 days). Let me check that exact number.

Yes, 60 *60 = 3600 seconds per hour. 24 *3600 = 86400 seconds per day. 365 days: 86400 *365 = 31,536,000 ≈ 3.1536e7 seconds.

So 1 year ≈3.1536e7 seconds.

So time in years is 1.05e19 seconds / 3.1536e7 seconds/year.

Compute that: 1.05e19 / 3.1536e7 = (1.05 /3.1536) )e(19-7) → (approx 0.333) * 1e12 → 3.33e11 years.

Wait, wait, 1.05 /3.1536 is approximately 0.333. So 0.333e12 → 3.33e11 years.

Looking at the options, option E is 3.3e11 years. But wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, but wait, let me recompute the exact division.

1.05e19 /3.1536e7 = (1.05 /3.1536) * 1e12.

1.05 /3.1536 → let's compute 3.1536 *0.333 = 1.0503. Oh, so 0.333 *3.1536 = approx 1.05. So 1.05 /3.1536 ≈0.333, so 0.333e12 → 3.33e11 years.

But looking at the options, option E is 3.3e11 years. So that would be the answer. But wait, wait, let me go back and check all steps for possible miscalculations.

Wait, let me check the volume calculation again. The radius is 0.05 cm, which is 0.0005 meters. So r=0.0005 m.

r^3= (0.0005)^3 = 1.25e-13 m³.

Volume V=4/3 pi r³= (4/3)*pi*(1.25e-13) = 5.236e-13 m³.

Wait, no, wait: 4/3 * pi * (0.0005)^3 = (4/3)*pi*(1.25e-13) = (4.1888) *1.25e-13 = 5.236e-13 m³.

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake here earlier. Because 0.0005 m is 5e-4 m, so cubed is (5e-4)^3=125e-12=1.25e-10 m³. Oh wait, wait, no! (5e-4)^3 is 125e-12, which is 1.25e-10 m³, not 1.25e-13. Because 1e-4 cubed is 1e-12. So 5e-4 cubed is 125e-12 = 1.25e-10.

So earlier, I think I miscalculated the volume. Let me correct this.

So V = (4/3)pi * (5e-4)^3 → (4/3) pi * 1.25e-10 = approx 5.236e-10 m³.

Wait, (5e-4)^3 is 1.25e-10 m³. So 4/3 pi times that is 5.236e-10 m³.

So V=5.236e-10 m³.

Then, mass m= 1000 kg/m³ *5.236e-10 m³ = 5.236e-7 kg.

Molar mass of H2O is 18.015 g/mol → 0.018015 kg/mol.

Moles n=5.236e-7 kg / 0.018015 kg/mol ≈2.905e-5 mol.

Number of molecules: 2.905e-5 mol *6.022e23 = 1.75e19 molecules.

Atoms: 3 *1.75e19=5.25e19 atoms.

Time in seconds:5.25e19 /5 =1.05e19 seconds.

Convert to years: 1.05e19 / 3.1536e7 = (1.05/3.1536) *1e12 → approx 0.3333e12 → 3.333e11 years.

Which matches option E:3.3 ×10^11 years.

But wait, looking back at the options, option E is 3.3e11. So that's it. So the correct answer would be E.

Wait, but in my initial calculation, I thought the volume was 5.236e-13 m³, but that was a mistake. I caught it and corrected it to 5.236e-10 m³, leading to 3.3e11 years, which is option E.

But wait, looking back, the options don't have E as the first option. Let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: 9.9 ×10^22 years

B:8.8 ×10^21 years

C:6.6 ×10^20 years

D:2.5 ×10^18 years

E:3.3 ×10^11 years

F:1.05 ×10^19 years

G:1.75 ×10^19 years

H:4.1 ×10^12 years

I:7.5 ×10^17 years

J:5.25 ×10^19 years

So E is 3.3e11. Which matches what I calculated. So the correct answer is E.

But wait, wait a moment. Let me double-check the calculation of the number of atoms. Because each water molecule is H2O, so 2 H and 1 O → 3 atoms. So yes, 3 per molecule. So that part is correct.

But let me think about the volume again. If the diameter is 0.1 cm, then radius is 0.05 cm, which is 0.5 mm, which seems small. So the volume is (4/3) pi (0.05 cm)^3.

Wait, 0.05 cm is 0.5 mm. So volume is (4/3) pi (0.5 mm)^3.

Wait, 0.5 mm is 0.0005 m, so (0.0005)^3 is 1.25e-13 m³? No, wait, 0.0005 m is 5e-4 m, so (5e-4)^3 is 125e-12 m³ = 1.25e-10 m³.

So yes, V=5.236e-10 m³.

Mass is 5.236e-7 kg. Moles:5.236e-7 kg / 0.018015 kg/mol = 2.905e-5 mol.

Molecules:2.905e-5 *6.022e23=1.75e19.

Atoms:5.25e19.

Time:5.25e19 atoms /5 per second =1.05e19 seconds.

1.05e19 /3.154e7 = approx 3.33e11 years. So E is correct.

To determine how long it would take to count the atoms in a spherical droplet of water with a diameter of 0.1 cm at a counting rate of 5 atoms per second, the following steps are performed:

1. **Calculate the volume of the droplet**:  
   The droplet is spherical with a diameter of 0.1 cm, so the radius is \( r = 0.05 \, \text{cm} = 0.0005 \, \text{m} \). The volume of a sphere is given by:  
   \[
   V = \frac{4}{3} \
