Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about motivation theories, and I need to figure out the correct answer. The question is asking which theory includes the key concepts of outcome, valence, and expectancy. Then I have to explain these concepts within that theory and discuss the practical implications for employee motivation.

Hmm, let's see. I remember that motivation theories are a big part of organizational behavior. The options are A through J, each a different theory. The key terms here are outcome, valence, and expectancy. I think I've heard these terms before in the context of one specific theory.

Wait, valence... Oh right, valence refers to the attractiveness or desirability of an outcome. So if an outcome is positive, it has high valence, which means the person is more likely to be motivated towards it. Outcome itself is the result or reward someone expects to get from their actions.

Expectancy, I believe, is about the probability that a certain action will lead to a specific outcome. Like, if I study hard, I expect to get good grades. So the strength of that belief affects motivation.

Putting these together, which theory uses these concepts? I'm trying to remember. There's Vroom's Expectancy Theory, right? I think that's the one. So the theory would be Expectancy Theory, which I think is option C.

Let me double-check. The other options: Two-factor theory (A) is Herzberg's, which talks about hygiene and motivators. Self-Determination Theory (B) focuses on autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Equity Theory (D) is about fairness in outcomes compared to others. Herzberg's (E) again is two-factor. Goal-Setting (F) is about specific goals. Maslow's Hierarchy (G) is the needs pyramid. McClelland's (H) is about achievement, power, and affiliation. Cognitive Evaluation (I) deals with intrinsic vs extrinsic rewards. Attribution (J) is about how we explain causes of behavior.

So yes, Expectancy Theory (C) fits. Now, the concepts: outcome is the result, valence is its attractiveness, and expectancy is the belief in achieving it. The theory suggests that motivation is a product of these factors. So employees will be motivated if they believe their effort leads to a desired outcome (expectancy), the outcome is attractive (valence), and the effort is worth it.

Practical implications: Managers should ensure that employees see a clear link between their efforts and rewards ( expectancy). Rewards should be meaningful and desired (valence). Also, making expectations clear and achievable can boost motivation. Maybe setting clear goals and providing appropriate incentives would help.

I think that's it. So the answer should be C.

The motivation theory that includes the key concepts of outcome, valence, and expectancy is **Expectancy Theory**. 

In Expectancy Theory, **outcome** refers to the result or reward an individual anticipates receiving as a consequence of their actions. **Valence** is the perceived attractiveness or desirability of that outcome, influencing how motivated someone is to achieve it. **Expectancy** is the individual's belief in the likelihood that their effort will lead to the desired outcome. Together, these elements determine an individual's motivation, as motivation is seen as the product of expectancy and valence.

The practical implications for employee motivation are that managers should ensure a clear link between effort and outcomes (expectancy), offer rewards that are meaningful and desirable (valence), and set achievable goals to enhance motivation.

Answer: C
