Okay, so I've got this question about brain damage and its effects on a person. Let me try to work through it step by step. The question is about Mr. Gordon who suffered damage to the back of his right frontal lobe. I'm supposed to figure out what he can't do as a result.

First, I remember that the frontal lobe is involved in various functions like decision-making, planning, and motor control. But the question mentions the back of the frontal lobe, which I think is more specific. Wait, the back part of the frontal lobe is actually the precentral gyrus, right? That's the primary motor cortex. So, the motor cortex controls voluntary movements.

Now, the primary motor cortex is located in the frontal lobe, specifically in the precentral gyrus. If there's damage here, it would affect motor functions. But I also recall that the motor cortex is contralateral, meaning the right side controls the left side of the body and vice versa. So if the right frontal lobe is damaged, the left side of the body might be affected.

Looking at the options, option B is about moving his left hand. That seems relevant because damage to the right motor cortex would impair movement on the left side. But wait, I should go through all the options to make sure.

Option A: Recognize faces. That's more related to the temporal lobe, specifically the fusiform gyrus, which is part of the ventral pathway for face recognition. So probably not A.

Option C: Hear sounds correctly. Hearing is mainly handled by the temporal lobe as well. The primary auditory cortex is in the superior temporal gyrus. So C might not be the right answer unless it's a more complex hearing issue, but the frontal lobe isn't primarily for basic hearing.

Option D: Understand information he reads. That's more about language comprehension, which is typically in the left hemisphere, specifically Wernicke's area in the temporal lobe. So D might be a left hemisphere issue.

Option E: Speak intelligibly. Speaking is usually a function of Broca's area, which is in the frontal lobe, but it's the left frontal lobe for most right-handed people. Since the damage is in the right frontal lobe, maybe E isn't the right choice unless Mr. Gordon is left-handed or has atypical language areas. But the question doesn't specify, so I think E is less likely.

Option F: Taste food properly. Taste is handled by the insula and the frontal operculum, so maybe not F unless the damage is specific, but the question is about the back of the frontal lobe, which is more motor.

Option G: Understand information he hears. That circles back to Wernicke's area again, which is left hemisphere, so G is probably not it.

Option H: See clearly. Vision is handled by the occipital lobe. So H isn't related to frontal lobe damage.

Option I: Feel temperature changes. That's more about the parietal lobe, specifically the somatosensory cortex. So I isn't it.

Option J: Smell different scents. Smell is processed in the olfactory bulb and areas like the piriform cortex, which is more in the temporal lobe. So J isn't related to the frontal lobe.

Wait, so the primary motor cortex in the right frontal lobe controls the left side of the body. So damage there would affect movement on the left side. So option B, moving his left hand, makes sense. So the answer should be B.

But wait, another thought: the question says the back of the right frontal lobe. The back part of the frontal lobe is the motor cortex, yes. So yes, motor functions on the opposite side would be impacted. So yes, the correct answer is B.

The question involves damage to the back of Mr. Gordon's right frontal lobe, which corresponds to the primary motor cortex (precentral gyrus). This area is responsible for controlling voluntary movements on the contralateral side of the body. Since the damage is in the right frontal lobe, it would specifically impair motor functions on the left side of the body.

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Recognize faces** – This function is associated with the temporal lobe, not the frontal lobe.  
- **B: Move his left hand** – The primary motor cortex in the right frontal lobe controls the left hand, making this the correct choice.  
- **C: Hear sounds correctly** – Hearing is primarily managed by the temporal lobe.  
- **D: Understand information he reads** – This involves language comprehension, typically localized to the left hemisphere.  
- **E: Speak intelligibly** – Speech production is linked to Broca's area, usually in the left frontal lobe.  
- **F: Taste food properly** – Taste is processed in the insula and frontal operculum, not the back of the frontal lobe.  
- **G: Understand information he hears** – This relates to auditory comprehension, managed by the left hemisphere.  
- **H: See clearly** – Vision is handled by the occipital lobe.  
- **I: Feel temperature changes** – This is managed by the parietal lobe.  
- **J: Smell different scents** – Smell is processed in the olfactory bulb and temporal lobe.  

The most accurate answer is **B**, as damage to the right primary motor cortex would impair movement of the left hand.  

Answer: B
