Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about chi-square procedures, and I need to figure out which statements are true. Let me think through each statement step by step.

The question has three statements, I, II, and III. I need to evaluate each one.

Statement I: "In order to use a χ² procedure, the expected value for each cell of a one- or two-way table must be at least 5." Hmm. I remember that for the chi-square test, there's a rule about expected values. I think the rule is that each cell should have an expected frequency of at least 5. Or is it 5? Wait, sometimes people say at least 5, but I might be mixing it up. I think actually, the rule is that at least 80% of the cells should have expected counts of 5 or more, but maybe that's when using the approximation. Or wait, no, I'm getting confused. Oh wait, I think the more precise rule is that each expected cell count should be at least 5 for the chi-square test to be valid, otherwise, the approximation might not be good. So Statement I says that's required. So I think Statement I is true.

Statement II: "In order to use χ² procedures, you must have at least 2 degrees of freedom." Degrees of freedom for chi-square depend on the table's dimensions. For a one-way table (like a goodness-of-fit test), the df is (number of categories - 1). So for example, if you have two categories, df would be 1. But if you're doing a two-way table (like a contingency table), df is (rows-1)(columns-1). So, for a 2x2 table, df would be (2-1)(2-1)=1. So, in that case, you have only 1 df. So if that's allowed, then you don't need at least 2. So Statement II says you must have at least 2 degrees of freedom. But that's not the case because in a 2x2 table, which is valid, you have 1 df. So Statement II would be false.

Wait, but maybe the statement is about the procedure in general. Like, can you have a chi-square test with 1 df? I think yes. So Statement II is incorrect.

Statement III: "In a 4 × 2 two-way table, the number of degrees of freedom is 3." Let me calculate. For a two-way table, df is (rows-1)(columns-1). So rows are 4, columns 2. So (4-1)(2-1) = 3*1=3. So yes, df is 3. So Statement III is true.

So now, evaluating each statement: I is true, II is false, III is true.

Wait wait, earlier I thought Statement I was true, but now I'm getting a little uncertain. Because I remember that the expected counts should be at least 5, but when I've taken courses before, sometimes people say that for a 2x2 table, having 5 in each cell is okay, but sometimes the rule is more lenient. Oh wait, perhaps the expected value doesn't have to be at least 5 for each cell. Maybe the rule is different. Let me think again.

I recall that a common guideline is that no more than 20% of the cells should have expected counts less than 5. So if some are below 5 but most are 5 or more, it's okay. So Statement I says each cell must have at least 5. That's a stricter requirement than the guideline. So Statement I is actually false because you don't need every cell to meet that. So if a cell is expected to have, say, 4, but the others are okay, the chi-square can still be used as an approximation, but with caution. So Statement I is incorrect.

Wait, now I'm getting myself confused. So in textbooks, what do they say? I think the typical advice is that each expected frequency should be at least 5. So that might mean Statement I is correct. But I'm not 100% sure. Let me think: in the case of small tables, like 2x2, if each expected count is at least 5, then the approximation is better. But sometimes, when the expected counts are lower, people might use Fisher's exact test instead. So perhaps, the statement is correct in that the procedure (chi-square) requires each expected cell to be at least 5. So I'm a bit torn.

Wait, going back to the question: Statement I says "must be at least 5". So if that's a hard requirement, then Statement I is correct. Otherwise, if it's a guideline, then not. I think different sources vary on this. For example, Zar's Biostatistical Analysis says that expected values should be at least 5, but in Agresti's Categorical Data Analysis, he says that the expected counts should be at least 5 for each cell, but that in practice, it's often relaxed, and that some allow 1 or 2 cells to have expected counts as low as 3 or 4 if the total sample size is large enough. So it's a bit of a grey area.

But in the context of exams, the usual teaching is that each expected cell count should be at least 5, so Statement I would be correct. So I'm a bit confused.

Wait, but some sources say that the expected cell counts need to be at least 5 for all cells when using the chi-square test. So perhaps Statement I is correct. So if that's the case, then Statement I is true.

Wait, but what if it's a one-way table with 3 categories. If expected counts are 4,4,4, would the chi-square test be invalid? Or is it that for one-way tables, the expected counts don't need to be as high? Hmm, maybe the rules are different for one-way and two-way tables.

Wait, perhaps the expected counts for each category in a one-way table (like goodness-of-fit) should be at least 5. So in that case, Statement I would be correct, as it applies to both one- and two-way tables.

But I'm getting stuck. Let's set that aside for a moment and look at the other statements.

Statement II: Must have at least 2 degrees of freedom. As I thought earlier, a 2x2 table has 1 df, and chi-square can be used there. So Statement II is false.

Statement III: 4x2 table, df=3. Yes, (4-1)(2-1)=3. So III is correct.

So, if Statement I is correct, then statements I and III are correct, which would be option C: I and III only.

But if Statement I is incorrect, then only Statement III is correct, which is option D.

So I need to get back to Statement I.

Wait, another approach: The expected count is calculated as (row total * column total)/grand total. So for a 2x2 table, each cell's expected value would be (n/2 * n/2)/n = n/4. So if n is 10, expected is 2.5 in each cell, which is below 5, but we still can use chi-square, though perhaps with Yates' correction or switch to Fisher's exact test. So in such cases, the expected values are below 5, but chi-square is sometimes still used. So perhaps the rule is not that each cell must have at least 5, making Statement I incorrect.

Wait, but I'm recalling that when the expected counts are too low, the chi-square approximation isn't good, so alternative methods are preferred. But the question is, does the procedure require that each cell's expected value is at least 5. If the rule is a "must" for using the chi-square procedure, then when expected counts are below 5, you shouldn't use it. So Statement I would be true, but if it's a guideline, then it's false.

In academic settings, sometimes the expected counts are required to be at least 5, so Statement I would be correct. But in reality, with small tables, it's often overlooked, and chi-square is used anyway, perhaps with a note about approximation.

Hmm, I'm still a bit stuck. Let me consider the options. The options are:

A: II only → II is false, so no.

B: I and II → II is false, so no.

C: I and III only → if I is true and III is true, then yes.

D: III only → if I is false and III is true.

E: I and II only → II is false.

F: I, II, and III → II is false.

G: I only → III is true, so no.

H: I, II, and III → II is false.

I: None → Only if all are false.

J: II and III only → II is false.

So the options are either C or D, depending on whether Statement I is true.

If Statement I is correct, then the answer is C. If I is incorrect, then the answer is D.

Wait, another point: The question says "must be at least 5". So if a single cell has an expected value below 5, can you not use chi-square? Or is it that the test is approximate but can still be used?

In practice, people might still report the chi-square statistic but with a caveat. So perhaps the rule is not a hard and fast 'must' but more of a guideline.

So, if the question is about whether the procedure requires it, then Statement I is false because you can use the procedure even if some expected counts are below 5; however, the results might not be as reliable.

So, considering that, Statement I is false. Therefore, only Statement III is correct, which makes the answer D.

Wait, but earlier I thought Statement I was correct. Now I'm changing my mind.

So, to recap:

I: False (it's a guideline, not a strict requirement).

II: False (can have 1 df, like in 2x2 tables).

III: True (df =3).

So only Statement III is true. So the correct answer is D: III only.

To determine which statements are true, let's analyze each one carefully:

### Statement I:  
"In order to use a χ² procedure, the expected value for each cell of a one- or two-way table must be at least 5."  
This statement is problematic. While a common guideline is that expected cell counts should be at least 5 for the chi-square approximation to be reliable, this is not a strict requirement. Chi-square can still be used when some cells have expected counts below 5, though the results may be less reliable and alternative methods (e.g., Fisher's exact test) might be preferred. Therefore, this statement is **false** because it is not a hard and fast rule.

### Statement II:  
"In order to use χ² procedures, you must have at least 2 degrees of freedom."  
This statement is incorrect. The degrees of freedom for a two-way table are calculated as \((\text{rows} - 1)(\text{columns} - 1)\). For example, a \(2 \times 2\) table has 1 degree of freedom, and chi-square procedures can still be applied. Thus, having at least 2 degrees of freedom is not a requirement. This statement is **false**.

### Statement III:  
"In a 4 × 2 two-way table, the number of degrees of freedom is 3."  
This statement is correct. For a \(4 \times 2\) table, the degrees of freedom are calculated as \((4 - 1)(2 - 1) = 3\). Therefore, this statement is **true**.

### Conclusion:  
- Statement I: False  
- Statement II: False  
- Statement III: True  

The only true statement is III. Therefore, the correct answer is **D: III only**.

**Answer: D**
