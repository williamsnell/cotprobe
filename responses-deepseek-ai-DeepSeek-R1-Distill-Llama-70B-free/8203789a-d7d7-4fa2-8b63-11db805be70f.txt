Okay, so I've got this chemistry multiple-choice question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what the question is about. The question is about group 13 elements and their oxidation states. Specifically, it's asking which group 13 element has a more stable +1 oxidation state compared to its +3 state.

Hmm, group 13 elements... I remember that group 13 is the old IIIA group, which includes elements like boron, aluminum, gallium, indium, and thallium. So the options given are A: Al, B: Tl, D: B, H: Ga, I: In. Wait, the options given are A through J, but the choices include B (Tl), D (B), H (Ga), I (In).

Wait, the question is about when the +1 state is more stable than +3. I think that as you go down a group in the periodic table, the stability of lower oxidation states increases. Because of the inert pair effect, where the s electrons don't participate in bonding as much in heavier elements. So for group 13, elements at the bottom might prefer +1 over +3.

Let me think about each element. Boron is at the top, and I think it usually shows a +3 oxidation state. Aluminum is next, and I believe aluminum almost always uses +3; +1 is rare if it exists at all. Then comes gallium, indium, and thallium.

Wait, thallium is the last in the group. So maybe it has a more stable +1 state. I remember that thallium exhibits a +1 oxidation state quite commonly. Like in compounds such as TlNO3 (thallium nitrate) and TlCl. But I'm not as sure about the others.

Gallium and indium are before thallium. Do they show +1 states? I think they can, but maybe not as predominantly as thallium. For example, gallium can have both +1 and +3, but I think +3 is more common because gallium is relatively lighter. Indium might have some +1 compounds, but again, probably less so than thallium.

I'm trying to recall specific compounds. Thallium(I) oxide, Tl2O, is known, and thallium tends to form +1 ions in its compounds more readily than the other group 13 elements. On the other hand, elements like aluminum are pretty much stuck in +3. So the answer might be thallium.

Looking back at the options, option B is Tl. So the correct answer should be B.

The question asks which group 13 element has a more stable +1 oxidation state compared to its +3 oxidation state. Group 13 elements include boron (B), aluminum (Al), gallium (Ga), indium (In), and thallium (Tl). The stability of the +1 oxidation state increases down the group due to the inert pair effect, where the s-electrons of heavier elements do not participate in bonding as readily.

- Boron (+3 oxidation state is most common).  
- Aluminum predominantly exhibits the +3 oxidation state.  
- Gallium and indium can exhibit both +1 and +3 oxidation states, but +3 is more common.  
- Thallium, being the heaviest in the group, shows a strong preference for the +1 oxidation state in many of its compounds, such as TlNO3 and TlCl.  

Thus, thallium (Tl) is the group 13 element where the +1 oxidation state is more stable than the +3 oxidation state.  

Answer: B
