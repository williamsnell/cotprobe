Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about peace studies in the twentieth century. I need to figure out which statement isn't applicable. Let me go through each option one by one.

The question is asking which statement is not applicable. So, I'm looking for the one that's incorrect or doesn't fit with the development of peace studies.

Starting with option A: "Peace studies sought to provide a more global and non-state centric view of major issues of conflict." I remember that traditional international relations often focused on states, but peace studies probably looked beyond that, considering other factors like NGOs, economies, etc. So A sounds correct and applicable.

Option B: "At the height of the Cold War, peace studies was frequently labelled 'appeasement studies' and was bitterly opposed by critics." During the Cold War, anything that seemed too soft might have been criticized. Appeasement was a term from before WWII, but maybe they used it again. So B seems plausible.

Option C: "Peace studies in the twentieth century focused solely on the prevention of nuclear warfare." Wait, that doesn't sound right. Peace studies cover a lot more than just nuclear issues, like conflict resolution, social justice, etc. So C is probably not applicable because it's too narrow.

Option D: "The development of peace studies was largely influenced by the rise of feminism in the late twentieth century." Feminism did influence various fields, including peace studies, looking at gender roles in conflict. So D is correct.

Option E: "Within peace studies, one of the later developments was a major interest in conflict prevention, conflict resolution, and peacekeeping." That makes sense. Early on, they might have focused on causes, but later they'd develop methods to prevent and resolve conflicts. So E is applicable.

Option F: "The development of peace studies was not affected by the events of the Cold War." That seems unlikely. The Cold War was a major event, and peace studies would have been influenced by it. So F is probably incorrect, meaning it's not applicable.

Option G: "By the 1970s, prominent peace researchers were calling for a broadening in the remit of the field but were largely unsuccessful in their attempts." Wait, I'm not sure. I think in the 70s, peace studies did broaden. Maybe some tried but weren't successful then? Or maybe they were. I'm a bit fuzzy on this, but I'll come back to it.

Option H: "By the end of the twentieth century, peace studies had become a universally accepted academic discipline." I'm not sure. I think it's more established now, but 'universally accepted' might be an overstatement. Some might still see it as less rigorous than other fields, but I'm not certain. Maybe H is incorrect.

Now, the question is which is not applicable. Let's evaluate each.

Looking back, the options that seem incorrect are C, F, and possibly H and G.

Option C says peace studies focused solely on nuclear warfare. That's definitely wrong because peace studies covers a broad range of issues like economic disparities, human rights, etc. So C is not applicable.

Option F says the Cold War didn't affect peace studies. That can't be right. The Cold War influenced many academic fields, including how conflict and peace were studied. So F is incorrect as well.

Wait, but the question is which is NOT applicable. So the answer should be the incorrect statement about peace studies.

So, the question is which statement is not applicable. So the wrong statements are the ones that do not fit the development.

So looking back, let me re-examine each option.

Option C is wrong because peace studies isn't just about nuclear warfare. So C is not applicable.

Option F is wrong because Cold War definitely influenced peace studies. So F is not applicable.

Similarly, option H says it became universally accepted. I'm not sure, but I think that's an overstatement. Maybe by the end of the century, it was more established but not universally accepted.

So now, the question is, which options are not applicable. The question is about which is not applicable, so which statement is incorrect.

The options are:

C: Solely nuclear. → Not true.

F: Not affected by Cold War. → Not true.

H: Universally accepted. → Maybe not, but I'm less sure.

So the question is which of the options is not applicable. So the incorrect statements are the ones that don't fit.

The question is which is not applicable, meaning which statement is false about the development.

So the possible answers could be C and F. But we have to choose one.

Looking back at the options, the question is which is not applicable. So the wrong statement is the one that doesn't apply.

Looking at the options, C says focused solely on nuclear. That's incorrect. F says not affected by Cold War, which is also incorrect.

So which is the correct answer. The question is which is not applicable.

Wait, the options are A through H, and the question is which is not applicable. So which of these is incorrect.

Another approach: go through each option and see if it's applicable or not.

A: Global/non-state centric. Applicable. So correct, so A is applicable, not the answer.

B: Labelled appeasement. I think during Cold War, people might have been skeptical of peace studies, so B is applicable.

C: Solely nuclear. Not applicable, so C is the incorrect statement.

D: Influenced by feminism. Applicable, as feminist theories contributed.

E: Later development in conflict prevention. That happened, so E is applicable.

F: Not affected by Cold War. That's incorrect, so F is not applicable.

G: By 1970s, called for broadening but unsuccessful. I'm not sure about this. Did they broaden in the 70s? I thought they did, so maybe G is incorrect. Or maybe some tried but failed, but I'm not certain.

H: Universally accepted by end of century. Not sure, but maybe it's an overstatement, so H is not applicable.

Wait, but the question is which is not applicable. So the wrong statement is the one that's incorrect.

So the options that are incorrect are C, F, perhaps G and H.

Now, the question is asking which is not applicable, so the answer is the incorrect statement.

Looking at the options again, the question is about the development of peace studies.

Option C is incorrect because it says focused solely on nuclear, which isn't true.

Option F is incorrect because the Cold War did affect peace studies.

So both C and F are incorrect, but the options are single choice.

Wait, but the question asks which statement is not applicable. So the answer is the incorrect statement.

Wait, perhaps the answer is F because it claims no effect, which is wrong.

Alternatively, C is wrong because it's too narrow.

So the answer could be either C or F.

Wait, but in the options, the answer is one of A-J.

Looking back at the problem, perhaps I should think about each option.

Option F: "The development of peace studies was not affected by the events of the Cold War." That's not true because the Cold War, with its focus on deterrence and arms races, definitely influenced peace studies. So F is not applicable.

Option C: "Peace studies... focused solely on nuclear warfare." That's incorrect as peace studies covers more.

So both C and F are incorrect. But the question is which is not applicable, so which one is the correct answer.

Wait, looking back, perhaps option C is the one that's not applicable because it's incorrect. So the answer is C.

But I'm a bit confused because option F is also incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the other options can help. Let's go through them.

Option G: "By the 1970s, prominent peace researchers were calling for a broadening in the remit of the field but were largely unsuccessful in their attempts." I think by the 70s, peace studies did broaden, so maybe G is incorrect. But the statement says they were unsuccessful. So if they were unsuccessful, then G is correct, but perhaps the opposite is true.

Option H: "Universally accepted." Probably an overstatement, so H is not applicable.

But the question is about which is not applicable. So the options that are incorrect.

Wait, the initial question is which statement is not applicable. So which one does not describe the development of peace studies.

So, the answer should be the incorrect statement.

So, considering all, the answer is either C or F.

But let me think about real history. Peace studies in the 20th century: Early on, it was influenced by the two World Wars, then the Cold War. So the Cold War definitely had an impact, so F is incorrect.

And peace studies includes more than just nuclear issues, so C is incorrect.

So the question is which of these is not applicable.

Looking at the options, the correct answer is either C or F.

Wait, the possible answers are from A to H, with the correct answer being one of them.

Wait, the options are A to H, but the choices are A-J, but the options are only up to H. Maybe the user meant up to H.

But in any case, I'm a bit stuck between C and F.

But according to what I know, peace studies did focus on more than just nuclear, so C is incorrect.

Also, the Cold War definitely influenced peace studies, so F is incorrect.

So the question is which one is the answer.

Looking at the options, the question is which is not applicable, meaning which is false.

So the correct answer would be the incorrect statement.

But since the question asks which is not applicable, which of these is not applicable.

In the options, C says focused solely on nuclear, which is not correct, so C is not applicable.

Similarly, F says not affected by Cold War, which is false, so F is not applicable.

Wait, but the options are mutually exclusive. So which one is the correct answer.

Hmm. Let me think again.

The question is, which statement is NOT applicable.

So, which statement does NOT apply to the development.

So for example, if a statement is false about peace studies, then it's the answer.

Thus, the answer would be the incorrect statement.

So the correct answer is the incorrect statement.

So, if C is incorrect, then C is the answer.

Similarly, if F is incorrect, then F is the answer.

So which one is more incorrect?

I think the focus solely on nuclear is a bigger mistake. Because peace studies cover a lot of areas.

So I think the answer is C.

Wait, but another thought: peace studies did focus a lot on nuclear disarmament during the Cold War, but not solely. So perhaps C is the incorrect statement.

Yes, I think C is the answer.

So the statement that is not applicable is C.

To determine which statement is not applicable to the development of peace studies in the twentieth century, each option is analyzed as follows:

- **Option A**: Peace studies sought to provide a more global and non-state-centric view of conflict. This is applicable, as peace studies expanded beyond state-centric perspectives to include other actors and factors.

- **Option B**: At the height of the Cold War, peace studies was frequently labeled 'appeasement studies' and was bitterly opposed by critics. This is applicable, as peace studies faced criticism during the Cold War for being perceived as too conciliatory.

- **Option C**: Peace studies in the twentieth century focused solely on the prevention of nuclear warfare. This is not applicable, as peace studies encompassed a broad range of issues, including social justice, human rights, and economic disparities, not just nuclear warfare.

- **Option D**: The development of peace studies was largely influenced by the rise of feminism in the late twentieth century. This is applicable, as feminist theories contributed to peace studies by highlighting gender roles in conflict.

- **Option E**: Within peace studies, one of the later developments was a major interest in conflict prevention, conflict resolution, and peacekeeping. This is applicable, as these areas became central to the field over time.

- **Option F**: The development of peace studies was not affected by the events of the Cold War. This is not applicable, as the Cold War significantly influenced peace studies, particularly in areas like nuclear deterrence and arms control.

- **Option G**: By the 1970s, prominent peace researchers were calling for a broadening in the remit of the field but were largely unsuccessful in their attempts. This is debatable, as peace studies did broaden in scope during the 1970s, making this statement potentially incorrect.

- **Option H**: By the end of the twentieth century, peace studies had become a universally accepted academic discipline. This is not entirely applicable, as "universally accepted" may be an overstatement, though the field had gained significant recognition.

The question asks for the statement that is **not applicable**. Both **C** and **F** are incorrect, but **C** is the most clearly incorrect because it inaccurately claims that peace studies focused **solely** on nuclear warfare, which is a significant misrepresentation of the field's scope. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C**

Answer: C
