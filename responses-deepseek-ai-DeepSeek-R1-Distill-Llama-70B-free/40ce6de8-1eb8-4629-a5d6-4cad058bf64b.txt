Okay, so I need to figure out what "Mahavira" means. I remember that Mahavira is a significant figure in Jainism, right? He's like one of their main teachers or something. But wait, what does the name itself mean? I think it's a Sanskrit word, so I should break it down.

"Mahavira" is made up of two parts: "Maha" and "Vira". I know "Maha" means "great" because I've heard it in other contexts, like "Maharaja" which is a king, so maybe "great king". Then "Vira" I think means "hero" or "warrior". So putting it together, "Great Hero" makes sense. 

Looking at the options, option B is "Great Hero". But wait, I also recall that sometimes "Mahavira" is translated differently. Another thought: in some contexts, "Vira" might mean something else. Like, could it be more specific than just hero? Hmm, but I don't think so. Hero seems right.

Alternatively, is there another option that fits better? Let me look through the options again. Option I is "The Victorious One", which sounds similar. But I think "Victorious" might be more like "Jina", another title for Mahavira. Oh right, because "Jina" means "conqueror" or "victor", so that's a different title. So "Mahavira" as "Great Hero" is more accurate.

So the answer should be B: "Great Hero".

The name "Mahavira" is derived from the Sanskrit words "Maha" meaning "great" and "Vira" meaning "hero" or "warrior." Thus, it translates to "Great Hero." This title reflects his significance as a central figure in Jainism. While other titles like "Jina" (meaning "Victorious One") are also used for him, "Mahavira" specifically emphasizes his role as a great hero.

Answer: B
