Question:

Anton has two species of ants, Species A and Species B, in his ant farm. The two species are identical in appearance, but Anton knows that every day, there are twice as many ants of Species A than before, while there are three times as many ants of Species B. On Day 0, Anton counts that there are 30 ants in his ant farm. On Day 5, Anton counts that there are 3281 ants in his ant farm. How many of these are of Species A?

Options:

A: 608
B: 960
C: 2321
D: 211
E: 500
F: 512
G: 11
H: 1000
I: 2048
J: 150

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about Anton's ants. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

Anton has two species of ants, A and B. They look the same, but their populations grow differently. Every day, the number of Species A doubles, so it's multiplied by 2 each day. Species B triples each day, multiplied by 3. On Day 0, there are 30 ants total. On Day 5, the total is 3281. The question is asking how many of these are Species A on Day 5.

Hmm, so I think I need to set up some equations to model this situation. Let's denote the number of Species A on Day 0 as 'a' and Species B as 'b'. So on Day 0, a + b = 30.

Then, each day, A doubles, so on Day 5, the number of A would be a * (2^5), since each day it multiplies by 2. Similarly, Species B would be b * (3^5) on Day 5.

The total on Day 5 is given as 3281, so the equation would be a*(2^5) + b*(3^5) = 3281.

I can compute 2^5 and 3^5. Let me calculate that. 2^5 is 32, and 3^5 is 243. So substituting, the equation becomes 32a + 243b = 3281.

And from Day 0, we have a + b =30. So now I have a system of two equations:

1. a + b =30
2. 32a + 243b =3281

I can solve this system to find 'a' and then compute the number of Species A on Day 5.

Let me express 'a' from the first equation: a =30 -b.

Substituting into the second equation:

32*(30 -b) + 243b =3281.

Let me compute 32*30 which is 960, and 32*(-b) is -32b.

So 960 -32b +243b =3281.

Combine like terms: 960 + (243b -32b )= 960 +211b =3281.

Subtract 960 from both sides: 211b = 3281 -960.

Calculating that: 3281 minus 960 is 2321.

So 211b =2321.

Wait, but 211 * 11 is 2321. Let me check: 211 *10 is 2110, plus 211 is 2321. So b=11.

Then a =30 -b =30-11=19.

So on Day 0, there are 19 of A and 11 of B.

Now, on Day 5, the number of A is 19 *32 (because 2^5 is 32). Let's calculate that.

19 *32: 20*32=640, minus 1*32=32, so 640-32=608.

So the number of Species A on Day 5 is 608.

Looking at the options, option A is 608, so I think that's the correct answer.

Letâ€™s denote the number of Species A on Day 0 as \( a \) and Species B as \( b \). On Day 0, the total number of ants is given as:

\[
a + b = 30 \tag{1}
\]

Each day, the population of Species A doubles, and Species B triples. On Day 5, the populations are \( a \cdot 2^5 \) for Species A and \( b \cdot 3^5 \) for Species B. The total number of ants on Day 5 is given as:

\[
32a + 243b = 3281 \tag{2}
\]

From Equation (1), \( a = 30 - b \). Substituting this into Equation (2):

\[
32(30 - b) + 243b = 3281
\]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[
960 - 32b + 243b = 3281
\]

\[
960 + 211b = 3281
\]

\[
211b = 2321
\]

\[
b = 11
\]

Substituting \( b = 11 \) into \( a = 30 - b \):

\[
a = 19
\]

On Day 5, the number of Species A is:

\[
a \cdot 2^5 = 19 \cdot 32 = 608
\]

Thus, the number of Species A on Day 5 is **608**.
