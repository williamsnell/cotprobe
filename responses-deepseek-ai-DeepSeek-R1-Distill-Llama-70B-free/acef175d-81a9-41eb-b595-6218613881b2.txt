Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about reacting rubidium and bromine. We have 1.0 gram of each. I need to find out what's left in the reaction vessel in measurable amounts, more than 0.10 mg.

Hmm, I remember that when metals react with halogens, they form salts. Rubidium is a metal, right? And bromine is a halogen. So they should react to form rubidium bromide. But wait, what about stoichiometry? I think I need to calculate the limiting reagent here.

So first, I'll find the molar masses. Rubidium has an atomic weight of about 85.47 g/mol. Bromine is a diatomic molecule, Br2, so its molar mass is roughly 2 * 80 g/mol = 160 g/mol.

Wait, no, wait. Bromine as an element is Br2, so yes, 160 g/mol. So for 1.0 g of rubidium, the moles would be 1.0 g / 85.47 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 1 divided by 85.47 is approximately 0.0117 moles of Rb.

And for bromine, 1.0 g / 160 g/mol is about 0.00625 moles of Br2. 

Now, the reaction between Rb and Br2. Rubidium is in group 1, so it forms a +1 ion. Bromine is -1 each. So the formula is RbBr. The balanced equation would be 2 Rb + Br2 → 2 RbBr.

So from the equation, 2 moles of Rb react with 1 mole of Br2. So the mole ratio is 2:1 for Rb to Br2.

Now, looking at the moles I have: 0.0117 moles Rb and 0.00625 moles Br2. 

Let me see which is the limiting reactant. For the reaction, 2 moles of Rb require 1 mole of Br2. So how much Br2 is needed for the Rb? Let's calculate.

Given 0.0117 moles Rb, the required Br2 is 0.0117 / 2 = 0.00585 moles. But I have 0.00625 moles of Br2, which is more than required. So Rb is the limiting reactant here.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Wait, if I have 0.0117 moles Rb, and the reaction requires 2 Rb per 1 Br2, so the amount of Br2 needed is (0.0117 Rb moles) * (1 Br2 / 2 Rb) = 0.00585 moles Br2. Since I have 0.00625 moles Br2, which is more than 0.00585, Br2 is in excess. So Rb is the limiting reagent.

So all the Rb will react, and some Br2 will remain.

The reaction produces RbBr. Let's calculate how much.

From 0.0117 moles Rb, since 2 Rb → 2 RbBr, so it's a 1:1 ratio. So 0.0117 moles Rb produce 0.0117 moles RbBr.

What about the bromine left? The initial moles Br2 = 0.00625. Moles consumed = 0.00585 (from Rb's reaction). So remaining Br2 is 0.00625 - 0.00585 = 0.0004 moles.

Wait, 0.0004 moles Br2. Let's convert that to grams. Molar mass Br2 is 160 g/mol, so 0.0004 *160 = 0.064 grams, which is 64 mg. That's more than 0.10 mg, so it's measurable.

What about Rb? Since Rb is the limiting reagent, all of it reacts. So no Rb should be left. Unless there's a mistake in the stoichiometry.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I made a mistake.

Moles of Rb: 1.0g /85.47 ≈ 0.0117 mol. Correct.

Moles Br2: 1.0g /160 = 0.00625 mol. Correct.

Reaction ratio: 2 Rb : 1 Br2 → 2 RbBr.

So for 0.0117 Rb, needed Br2 is 0.0117 / 2 = 0.00585 mol.

Available Br2 is 0.00625. So Br2 in excess: 0.00625 - 0.00585 = 0.0004 mol. Which is 0.064g, 64 mg. So yes, Br2 remains.

But what about the products? The product is RbBr. So all the Rb is consumed, and some Br2 is left. So the products are RbBr and excess Br2.

Wait, but what about any unreacted Rb? No, because Rb is the limiting reagent, so it should all react. So the reaction vessel should have RbBr and Br2.

Wait, but wait, another thing. Could there be any other products? Let me think. Rubidium typically forms RbBr when reacting with bromine, not other bromides. So RbBr is the only product.

So the reaction goes to completion, so what's left is RbBr and excess Br2.

Wait, but let me think about the options. The options are:

A: RbBr only

B: RbBr, Rb, Br2, Rb2Br

C: RbBr and Rb2Br

D: RbBr, Rb, Br2

E: Rb and Br2 only

F: Br2 only

G: RbBr and Rb

H: Rb only

I: Nothing left

J: RbBr and Br2 only

So in our case, the remaining are RbBr and Br2. So J is the option, right?

But wait, another thought. Maybe if the reaction doesn't go to completion, but that's unlikely because Rb is a very reactive metal, and Br2 is a strong oxidizer. The reaction between them is probably vigorous and goes to completion, so all Rb reacts.

So, the products are RbBr and excess Br2.

Wait, but what if there's some unreacted Rb? No, because Rb is the limiting reagent. So all Rb is consumed, so no Rb left.

So, what about the Br2? It's left as a liquid. So, the vessel should have RbBr (which is a solid) and Br2 (liquid). But wait, bromine is a liquid at room temp, but when the reaction is done, perhaps it's in the vapor phase or dissolved?

Wait, but the reaction setup: when Rb and Br2 react, Rb is a solid, Br2 is a liquid. Upon reaction, Rb would dissolve in Br2, perhaps, and the reaction would produce RbBr. Once all Rb is consumed, excess Br2 remains. So the products would be RbBr and Br2.

Wait, but wait, let me think about the states. Rb is a solid, Br2 is a liquid. After reaction, RbBr is a solid, and any excess Br2 would remain as a liquid. So the vessel would contain solid RbBr and liquid Br2. So both are present.

So the measurable amounts left are RbBr and Br2. So option J.

But wait, what about other bromides like RbBr3 or something? No, Rb is +1, Br is -1, so RbBr is the only possible compound.

Another thought: maybe the reaction produces polyatomic ions or different stoichiometries, but I don't think so. Rb forms only RbBr.

So, the final conclusion: after the reaction, RbBr and excess Br2 are present in measurable amounts. So the correct option is J.

To determine what is left in measurable amounts (more than 0.10 mg) after reacting 1.0 g of rubidium (Rb) and 1.0 g of bromine (Br₂), we analyze the reaction and stoichiometry.

1. **Molar Masses and Moles**:
   - Rubidium (Rb): Molar mass = 85.47 g/mol. Moles of Rb = \( \frac{1.0}{85.47} \approx 0.0117 \, \text{mol} \).
   - Bromine (Br₂): Molar mass = 160 g/mol. Moles of Br₂ = \( \frac{1.0}{160} \approx 0.00625 \, \text{mol} \).

2. **Reaction and Stoichiometry**:
   - The reaction is \( 2 \, \text{Rb} + \text{Br}_2 \rightarrow 2 \, \text{RbBr} \).
   - From the stoichiometry, 2 moles of Rb react with 1 mole of Br₂. For 0.0117 moles of Rb, the required Br₂ is \( \frac{0.0117}{2} = 0.00585 \, \text{mol} \).
   - Since 0.00625 moles of Br₂ are available, Br₂ is in excess, and Rb is the limiting reagent.

3. **Products and Remaining Reactants**:
   - All 0.0117 moles of Rb react, producing \( 0.0117 \, \text{mol} \) of RbBr (1:1 ratio from the reaction equation).
   - The remaining Br₂ is \( 0.00625 - 0.00585 = 0.0004 \, \text{mol} \), which corresponds to \( 0.0004 \times 160 = 0.064 \, \text{g} \) (64 mg), a measurable amount.

4. **Analysis of the Reaction Vessel**:
   - Rubidium (Rb) is fully consumed as it is the limiting reagent.
   - The reaction produces rubidium bromide (RbBr), and excess bromine (Br₂) remains.
   - No other products, such as Rb₂Br, are formed because rubidium typically forms only RbBr with bromine.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The measurable amounts left in the reaction vessel are RbBr and Br₂.

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**J: RbBr and Br₂ only**

Answer: J
