Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about Teotihuacán. Let me start by reading the question carefully. It says that early excavators mistook ordinary housing compounds for palaces. Hmm, what does that imply?

Well, Teotihuacán was a big city, one of the largest in the ancient world. I remember that it's known for its pyramids, like the Pyramid of the Sun. But the question is about housing. So, the excavators thought regular houses were palaces. Why would they make that mistake?

Maybe because the housing was really impressive. If even the commoners' homes were built in a way that looked grand, like palaces, then the excavators wouldn't be able to tell the difference. That suggests that the standard of living was high, not just for the elite but for everyone. So the common people had good quality housing, making it hard to distinguish from what the elite would have.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it was a theocracy. I don't see how mistaking houses for palaces would directly indicate religious rule. Maybe, but not the first thought.

Option B suggests commoners took over elite homes. That could be a possibility, but the question says the excavators mistook them, implying that the structures themselves looked like palaces, not that they were taken over.

Option C talks about democracy. I don't think that's directly related to the housing structures. Democratic structures aren't necessarily indicated by housing quality.

Option D says the general standard of living was high. That makes sense because if even ordinary homes looked like palaces, then the society must have had a high standard overall.

Option E suggests elites lived in ordinary homes to blend in. That's possible, but why would they need to blend in unless there was some issue, like social unrest. I'm not sure if that's the best fit.

Option F says compounds were built with palace materials. If that's the case, then yes, they'd look like palaces. So this could be a possibility. But is it the same as a high standard of living? Maybe, but perhaps it's more about the materials used.

Option G is about wealth distribution. That ties into standard of living too, but I'm not sure if that's the direct implication.

Option I suggests an egalitarian society. If there's little stratification, then everyone's housing would be similar. But I thought Teotihuacán had some level of social hierarchy, with different districts for different classes.

Option J says the excavators were inexperienced. That's possible, but the question is about what the mistake suggests about the society, not about the excavators' skills.

So, narrowing down, the main point is that the housing was so good that it was mistaken for palaces. That points to a high standard of living overall. So D seems correct. Alternatively, F could be a contender if it's about materials, but the question is more about the overall impression of being a palace.

Wait, another angle: if the housing compounds were built with materials used for palaces, that would make them look like palaces. So F could also fit. But the question is about the fact that they were mistaken as palaces, which might imply that the quality was high, not just materials. So D is about the standard of living, which would encompass both materials and overall quality.

So I think D is the best answer. The society had a high standard of living, making ordinary homes look like palaces to the excavators.

The fact that early excavators of Teotihuacán mistook ordinary housing compounds for palaces suggests that the general standard of living in the city was high. This implies that even the homes of commoners were constructed with such quality and grandeur that they were easily mistaken for the residences of the elite. This high standard of living would have been evident in the materials, design, and overall quality of the housing compounds, making them indistinguishable from palaces to the excavators. 

While other options, such as the use of palace-like materials (Option F) or an egalitarian society (Option I), could partially explain the confusion, the most comprehensive explanation is that the society as a whole enjoyed a high standard of living, which would naturally result in impressive housing for all, including commoners.

Answer: D
