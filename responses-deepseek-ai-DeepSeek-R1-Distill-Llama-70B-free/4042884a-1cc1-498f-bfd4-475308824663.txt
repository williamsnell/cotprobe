Question:

Ann owns a tract of land. On August 1,2005, Ann sells to Hunter and Willa, a husband and wife, an undivided one-half interest in this land for $100,000 (the entire consideration being paid by Hunter). The deed to Hunter and Willa reads as follows: "To Hunger and Willa and their heirs as tenants by the entirety, and not as joint tenants, and not as tenants in common. "On August 1, 2006, Ann sells her remaining interest in the tract of land to Hunter and Brandon, his brother, for $125,000 (Hunter pays $80,000 of the purchase price, and Brandon pays the balance). The deed to Hunter and Brandon provides: "To Hunter and Brandon and their heirs as joint tenants and not as tenants in common. "On August 1, 2007, Hunter, Willa, and Brandon die in a common disaster, and as a consequence, the order of their deaths cannot be established by proof. Hunter's will and Willa's will devise whatever interest in the land in question that is subject to disposition by their wills to their son. Thus, the son owns

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this property law question. Let's see, Ann owns a tract of land and sells parts of it over time. The question is about who ends up owning what after some people die. 

First, let me break down the timeline. On August 1, 2005, Ann sells an undivided half interest to Hunter and Willa. The deed says they own it as tenants by the entirety, not joint tenants or tenants in common. I remember that tenants by the entirety is a form of co-ownership that's only for married couples. It has the right of survivorship, meaning if one dies, the other gets their share.

So in 2005, Hunter and Willa each have an interest as tenants by the entirety. But wait, since it's a half interest, together they own half the land. Ann still owns the other half at this point.

Then, on August 1, 2006, Ann sells her remaining half to Hunter and Brandon, his brother. The deed says they're joint tenants, not tenants in common. Joint tenants also have the right of survivorship, so the interest passes to the other joint tenant upon death.

So now, the entire land is owned in two halves. Let me think about how the ownership is structured.

The first sale (2005) gives Hunter and Willa an undivided 1/2 as tenants by the entirety. The second sale (2006) gives Hunter and Brandon an undivided 1/2 as joint tenants.

Wait, but each of these halves is separate. So the land is split into two 50% interests. Let me visualize this:

- 50% owned by Hunter and Willa as tenants by the entirety.
- 50% owned by Hunter and Brandon as joint tenants.

Now, on August 1, 2007, all three—Hunter, Willa, and Brandon—die in a common disaster, and we don't know the order of their deaths. Their wills both (Hunter and Willa) leave their interests to their son.

I need to figure out what happens to each of their interests upon their deaths.

First, let's handle the 50% owned by Hunter and Willa as tenants by the entirety. Because they are tenants by the entirety, when one dies, the other gets the entire share. But since both die, and we don't know the order, I think the law would apply the Uniform Simultaneous Death Act. Typically, this means that each is deemed to have predeceased the other for the purpose of property devolution. So, for the tenants by the entirety, if both spouses die simultaneously, each is treated as having died first. But wait, in this case, their interest was as tenants by the entirety, so each owned the entire 50% as a unit. If they both die, what happens?

Wait, maybe I should think of it differently. If one dies first, the survivor takes the whole. But since they died together, the law might treat each as having predeceased the other. So for the 50% they owned together, each would be treated as having died first, which would mean that their respective interests go to their respective estates. But since they both have wills devising their interest to their son, their son would get their respective shares.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's take it step by step.

Tenancy by the entirety: Upon the death of one spouse, the survivor gets the entire interest. But if both die, and the order isn't known, the Uniform Simultaneous Death Act (which most states follow) says that each person is deemed to have predeceased the other. So for the 50% they own together, each would be considered to have predeceased the other. So each spouse's interest would pass according to their will. So the 50% would go to their son, as each of their wills devises their interest to him. So the son would get the entire 50% from both parents?

Wait, that can't be right because each only owned an undivided half of the 50%? Or did they own it together as a whole?

Wait, no. As tenants by the entirety, each owns the entire 50% as a unit. So if one dies, the other gets the entire 50%. But if both die, then each is treated as having predeceased the other. So the 50% would go to their estates. But since they both have wills leaving their interest to their son, the son would get each of their interests, which together make up the 50%. So the son ends up with the entire 50% from the first sale.

Now, moving on to the other 50% owned by Hunter and Brandon as joint tenants. Joint tenancy also has the right of survivorship. So if one dies, the other gets the entire share. But again, both Hunter and Brandon die in the same disaster. So under the simultaneous death act, each is deemed to have predeceased the other. So their joint tenancy would convert into a tenancy in common because the right of survivorship can't apply if both die at the same time.

Wait, no. Wait, in a joint tenancy, if both die, the property is split. Each owns 50% of the 50% interest. So each has a 25% interest. Then, since they are deemed to have predeceased each other, each's 25% goes to their respective estates. But here, Hunter's will leaves his interest to his son. Brandon, I don't think we have information about his will. The problem doesn't mention Brandon's will, only Hunter and Willa's. So for Brandon's 25%, it would go according to his intestacy laws or his will, but since the problem doesn't say, perhaps we can assume it's irrelevant because the son only inherits from Hunter and Willa.

Wait, no, let me check. The problem says that Hunter's will and Willa's will devise whatever interest they have to their son. So Brandon's will isn't mentioned, so we don't know where his interest goes. But since the question is about what the son owns, perhaps we don't need to consider Brandon's share beyond Hunter's.

So for the joint tenancy 50%, which is owned by Hunter and Brandon as joint tenants:

- If both die, each is deemed to have predeceased the other.
- So the joint tenancy becomes a tenancy in common, each owning 25% of the entire property.
- So each has a 25% share. Hunter's 25% goes to the son via his will. Brandon's 25% goes to whoever is his heir, but the question doesn't ask about that.

So putting it all together:

From the first sale (50% as tenants by entirety):

- Both Hunter and Willa die, each's interest in this 50% goes to the son via their wills.
- So the son gets 50% of the land from this part.

From the second sale (50% as joint tenants):

- Hunter's 25% goes to the son.
- Brandon's 25% goes elsewhere (not to the son).

So the son ends up with 50% (from the first part) plus 25% (from the joint tenancy part) = 75% total.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm calculating this correctly. The first 50% is entirely to the son. The second 50% is split into two 25% shares. The son gets one of them (Hunter's 25%), so total is 50% +25% =75%.

But wait, the options don't have 75%. Let me look at the options again.

Options:

A: 1/4
B: 1/2
C: 1/3
D:5/6
E: entire
F: none
G:1/5
H:3/4
I:3/5
J:2/3

So option H is 3/4, which is 75%.

Wait, but let me double-check. Is the 50% from the first sale correct?

In the first sale, the 50% is owned by Hunter and Willa as tenants by entirety. When both die, each is deemed to have predeceased the other. So each of their interests would pass through their wills. Since each had an undivided 50% as tenants by entirety, but upon simultaneous death, each is treated as having died first. So the 50% would be split: each is deemed to have 50% of that 50%? Or does each own the entire 50% as a unit?

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. As tenants by the entirety, each spouse owns the entire undivided 50%, but upon the death of one, the other gets it all. But if both die, then each is treated as having died first. So each's interest in the 50% would go to their respective estates via their wills. But each spouse's interest is the entirety of the 50%, which is a bit confusing.

Wait, no. Let me think again. Tenancy by the entirety is a single, undivided ownership. So the 50% is owned by both as a unit. If one dies, the other gets the entire 50%. If both die, then each is deemed to have predeceased the other. So the 50% is treated as if each had a 50% interest as tenants in common, perhaps? So each would have a 25% interest in the entire property. But that doesn't make sense because as tenants by the entirety, they don't have individual shares. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that as tenants by the entirety, upon the simultaneous death, each is treated as having predeceased the other. So the 50% interest would go to their respective estates. But their wills each leave their interest to the son. So the son would take both Hunter's and Willa's interests, which together make up the entire 50% from the first sale.

So that's 50% from the first sale. Then, from the second sale, the joint tenancy 50%, which upon simultaneous death becomes two 25% shares. Hunter's 25% goes to the son, so that's another 25%.

So total is 50% +25% =75%, which is three-fourths. So the son owns three-fourths, which is option H.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not mixing up the interests.

Alternatively, perhaps the first 50% is entirely to the son, and the joint tenancy part gives another 25%, making 75% total. So the son has 75% of the entire tract.

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer should be option H: an undivided three-quarters interest.
</think>

To determine the son's ownership interest in the land, we analyze the sequence of events and the legal implications of each transaction and the simultaneous deaths.

1. **First Sale (August 1, 2005):**  
   Ann sells an undivided one-half interest in the land to Hunter and Willa as tenants by the entirety. This form of co-ownership includes the right of survivorship, meaning if one spouse dies, the other inherits the entire interest. Upon their simultaneous deaths in 2007, the Uniform Simultaneous Death Act applies, treating each as having predeceased the other. As a result, their respective interests pass according to their wills, both of which devise their interests to their son. Thus, the son inherits the entire 50% interest from this sale.

2. **Second Sale (August 1, 2006):**  
   Ann sells the remaining undivided one-half interest to Hunter and Brandon as joint tenants. Joint tenancy also includes the right of survivorship, but upon their simultaneous deaths, the Uniform Simultaneous Death Act again applies, treating each as having predeceased the other. This converts the joint tenancy into a tenancy in common, with each owning a 25% interest in the entire property. Hunter's 25% share passes to the son via his will, while Brandon's 25% share passes to Brandon's heirs (not relevant to the son's ownership).

3. **Total Ownership:**  
   - From the first sale, the son inherits the entire 50% interest.  
   - From the second sale, the son inherits an additional 25% interest (Hunter's share).  
   - Therefore, the son owns a total of 50% + 25% = 75% of the land.

The son's ownership is an undivided three-quarters interest in the land.
