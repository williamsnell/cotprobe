Question:

Dr. Sam Solo is the only psychologist in a small town, and his son is enrolled in the town's only elementary school. Dr. Solo receives a call from his son's teacher who says she would like to begin therapy with him. As an ethical psychologist, Dr. Solo should:

Options:

A: tell the teacher that he can only see her if she agrees to switch his son to a different class.
B: begin therapy with her but avoid discussing his son or any school-related matters.
C: begin therapy with her and discuss the potential for conflicts during the initial session and, if necessary, in subsequent sessions.
D: suggest that the teacher seek therapy with a different professional to avoid any potential conflict of interest.
E: refuse therapy and refer her to a psychologist in a neighboring town.
F: accept the teacher as a client, but only after discussing the situation with the school board.
G: tell the teacher that he is ethically prohibited from seeing her because to do so would constitute a multiple (dual) relationship.

Okay, so I have this question about ethics in psychology, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me start by understanding the scenario.

Dr. Sam Solo is the only psychologist in a small town. His son is in the elementary school there. The teacher, who is presumably his son's teacher, calls him to start therapy. So the question is about what Dr. Solo should do ethically.

I remember that in psychology, dual relationships are a big ethical issue. Dual relationships happen when a psychologist has another relationship with a client outside of the therapeutic one, like a family member, friend, or in this case, a teacher of their child. These can create conflicts of interest or impair the psychologist's objectivity.

Looking at the options:

Option A: He tells the teacher she can only be a client if she moves his son to another class. That seems like using his position to influence her actions, which might be unethical. It's like leveraging the therapy relationship for personal gain, which is probably wrong.

Option B: He starts therapy but avoids discussing his son or school matters. That might be tricky. If the teacher brings up issues related to the son or school, avoiding them could hinder her therapy. Plus, ignoring potential conflicts doesn't resolve the ethical issue; it just sidesteps it.

Option C: He begins therapy and discusses potential conflicts in the initial and subsequent sessions. This sounds proactive. By addressing the issue upfront, he can explore whether the dual relationship could cause problems and decide how to handle it. But I'm not sure if this fully addresses the ethical concerns. I think some relationships are so risky that they should be avoided even if discussed.

Option D: Suggest she sees another professional to avoid conflict of interest. This makes sense because if he takes her on as a client, there's a clear dual relationshipâ€”she's his son's teacher. This could lead to situations where his judgment is compromised, either in therapy or regarding his son's education. So, avoiding that by referring her elsewhere seems ethical.

Option E: He refuses therapy and refers her to another town's psychologist. This might be similar to D, but the question is whether it's necessary to go that far. If there's another psychologist in town, maybe that's better, but if he's the only one, she might have to go elsewhere. But the question says he's the only psychologist, so E is possible.

Option F: He accepts her but only after talking to the school board. That seems like involving others unnecessarily. The ethical decision is his responsibility, not the school board's. Plus, discussing it with them could breach confidentiality if they know she's seeking therapy.

Option G: He says he can't see her because of dual relationships. This is direct and clear, but I'm not sure if it's an absolute rule. Sometimes dual relationships can be navigated if they're not too harmful, but in this case, it's pretty significant because she's his son's teacher.

So, I think the main issue is the dual relationship. Ethical guidelines, like the APA's, warn against multiple relationships that could impair judgment or create exploitation risk. Here, treating the teacher could affect how he handles his son's education or vice versa.

Between options D and E: D suggests another professional, which could be in the same town if possible, but since he's the only one, maybe she has to go elsewhere. E says he refuses and refers her to a neighboring town. So if he's the only psychologist, E would make sense because there's no one else locally. But if other professionals exist, D would be better. Wait, the question says he's the only psychologist in the town, so she can't go to another local one. So E would be the correct choice.

Wait, but looking at the options again, E says he refers her to another town's psychologist. D says he suggests another professional without specifying location, but if there are none, maybe D isn't possible. Then E would be the right choice.

Alternatively, maybe D is better because it's more general. Or perhaps the question implies that there are other psychologists elsewhere, so D is possible. Hmm.

But the question is about what he should do. The ethical principle is to avoid dual relationships that could harm the therapeutic relationship or create a conflict. So the best course is to not take her on as a client and refer her to someone else.

So the options are either D or E. If there are other professionals, D is better. But if he's the only one in town, then E is necessary. Since the question says he's the only psychologist, E would be the way to go.

Wait, but looking back at the options, E says "refuse therapy and refer her to a psychologist in a neighboring town." So that makes sense because he can't refer her to another in the same town.

So the correct answer would be E?

Wait, but another thought: is it ethical to refuse therapy outright? Or should he at least assess if the dual relationship is manageable? But given the potential for conflict, especially with his son's education, it's probably better to avoid it entirely.

Alternatively, option D suggests another professional without specifying, but if there's no other in town, that's not possible. So perhaps the answer is E.

Wait, let me check the options again:

Option D: suggest she seek therapy with a different professional.

If there are no others in town, then D's suggestion can't be fulfilled, so E is the right action. But if there are others, D is better.

The question says Dr. Solo is the only psychologist in town. So if the teacher is in the same town, she can't go to another local psychologist. So Dr. Solo can't refer her to another in town; he has to refer her elsewhere.

So in that case, E is the correct choice.

Wait, but option D doesn't specify location. It just says "a different professional." So if she can go to another town, then D is possible. E is a specific case of D where the other professional is in a neighboring town.

So perhaps the correct answer is D, because it's more general, but given the context, E might be more appropriate.

But wait, the question is asking what Dr. Solo should do. If he's the only psychologist, then he can't refer her to another in the same town. So he must refer her to someone else outside, making E the correct answer.

Alternatively, some might argue that dual relationships aren't always prohibited but should be approached with caution. So discussing the potential conflict (option C) might be sufficient. But in this case, the dual relationship is significant because she's directly involved with his child, which could create a clear conflict of interest.

So perhaps the safest choice is to avoid the dual relationship entirely and refer her elsewhere, making E the correct answer.

Wait, but looking again: option D says "suggest that the teacher seek therapy with a different professional to avoid any potential conflict of interest." So that's a good approach. It doesn't matter where the other professional is; the point is to avoid the conflict.

In that case, if D is possible, then it's better because it directly addresses the conflict without necessarily requiring her to go to another town. Maybe there are other professionals nearby, even if not in the same town.

So perhaps D is the better answer.

I'm a bit confused. Let me think of the ethical guidelines. The APA's ethical principles state that psychologists should avoid multiple relationships that could impair their judgment or exploit the client. So in this case, the dual role as therapist and parent of her student could create such a conflict.

Therefore, the appropriate action is to avoid entering into the therapeutic relationship and refer her to another professional. So either D or E, depending on availability.

But since the question says he's the only psychologist in the town, he can't refer her to another in the same town. So he has to refer her to someone else, which could be in another town.

So the answer would be E.

Wait, but option D says to suggest a different professional without specifying location. So if there's another nearby, that's fine, but if not, she might have to go further. But the question doesn't specify whether other psychologists are available elsewhere. It only says he's the only one in the town.

So in that case, the correct answer is D: suggest she seek therapy with a different professional. Because that's the ethical thing to do, regardless of where that professional is.

Wait, but if he's the only one in town, then D's suggestion would require her to go elsewhere, which is exactly what E says. So E is a specific instance of D.

Hmm, but the answer options are separate. So which one aligns better with ethical standards?

According to the APA Ethics Code, when a dual relationship is anticipated, the psychologist should take steps to avoid it if it's likely to cause harm. So in this case, the potential for conflict is high, so the best action is to avoid it by referring her elsewhere.

So among the options, D and E are both about referring. But E is more specific, while D is more general.

I think the correct answer is D: suggest she seek therapy with a different professional. Because that's the appropriate ethical action, and the specifics of location are not the psychologist's responsibility beyond making the referral.

Wait, but the question is about what Dr. Solo should do. If he's the only psychologist in town, he can't refer her to another in town. So he must refer her to someone else, possibly in another town. So E is the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D because it's the general principle, regardless of the town's size.

I'm a bit stuck. Let me think of similar scenarios. If a client is a close friend, the psychologist should refer them to another professional. So in this case, the same applies.

So the answer is D or E. Since the question specifies that he's the only psychologist in town, the only option is to refer her to another town. So E is the correct answer.

Wait, but E says "refuse therapy and refer her to a neighboring town's psychologist." D says "suggest she seek a different professional." So D could include E as a possibility.

I think the point is that Dr. Solo should avoid the dual relationship. So the best action is to not take her on as a client and refer her to someone else. So the answer is D or E.

But the options are presented as separate choices. So I think the correct answer is D, because it's the general principle, but in this specific case, E would be the action. Hmm.

Wait, no. Let me check the answer options again.

Option E says he should refuse therapy and refer her to a neighboring town's psychologist. So that's a specific action.

Option D says he should suggest she seek therapy with a different professional, which could be in the same town if possible, but since he's the only one, it's not possible, so E becomes necessary.

But the question is about what he should do. So the correct answer is E.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me approach it differently.

Dual relationships can be problematic, especially when there's a power imbalance or potential for conflict of interest. Here, the teacher has influence over his son's education, and if he's her therapist, it could create an undue influence in either direction.

Therefore, the ethical decision is to avoid this dual relationship by not taking her as a client and referring her to someone else.

So the correct action is to refuse and refer her elsewhere, which is option E.

Wait, but some might argue that discussing the conflict (option C) is sufficient. But I think when the conflict is significant, like this one, the best course is to avoid it entirely.

So I think the answer is E.

Dr. Sam Solo is faced with an ethical dilemma where his son's teacher, who is in a position of influence over his child's education, seeks therapy with him. This creates a potential dual relationship, which could lead to conflicts of interest or impair Dr. Solo's objectivity. Ethical guidelines, such as those from the APA, caution against multiple relationships that could harm the therapeutic relationship or create exploitation.

**Analysis of the options:**

- **Option A:** This involves leveraging the therapeutic relationship to influence the teacher's actions, which is unethical and inappropriate.
- **Option B:** Avoiding discussions about the son or school-related matters does not resolve the ethical issue and could hinder the teacher's therapy.
- **Option C:** While discussing potential conflicts is a good practice, the dual relationship in this case is significant and likely cannot be managed effectively.
- **Option D:** Suggesting the teacher seek therapy with a different professional is a general ethical approach, but the question specifies that Dr. Solo is the only psychologist in the town, making this option less feasible.
- **Option E:** Refusing therapy and referring the teacher to a psychologist in a neighboring town directly addresses the conflict of interest and avoids the dual relationship entirely, making it the most appropriate action.
- **Option F:** Involving the school board is unnecessary and could breach confidentiality.
- **Option G:** While dual relationships are a concern, this option is overly broad and does not account for the possibility of referral.

Given that Dr. Solo is the only psychologist in the town, the most ethical course of action is to refuse therapy and refer the teacher to a psychologist in a neighboring town to avoid any potential conflict of interest.

**Answer:** E
