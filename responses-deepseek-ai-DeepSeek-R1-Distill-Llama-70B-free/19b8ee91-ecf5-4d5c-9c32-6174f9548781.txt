Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this Keynesian economics question. The question is about what happens when the money supply decreases according to Keynesian theory. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that Keynesian economics focuses on aggregate demand and the role of government intervention. The money supply is controlled by the central bank, right? So when the money supply decreases, what effects does that have?

I think the money supply affects interest rates. From what I learned, when the money supply decreases, interest rates tend to rise. Because if there's less money in the economy, it becomes more scarce, so the cost of borrowing (interest rates) goes up. That makes sense because lower money supply means banks have less to lend, so they charge more for it.

Now, how does that affect spending? In Keynesian theory, spending—especially investment and consumption—is influenced by interest rates. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive. So businesses might be less likely to take out loans to invest in new projects, and consumers might borrow less for big purchases like cars or homes.

So if interest rates are higher because the money supply decreased, then borrowing becomes more expensive, which would reduce investment and consumption. Lower spending overall would mean lower aggregate demand, which could lead to slower economic growth or even recession.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Raise interest rates which would encourage saving and therefore increase spending. Wait, higher interest rates encourage saving because you get more from your savings. But if people save more, they spend less, right? So that would decrease spending, not increase. So A might be incorrect.

Option B: Lower interest rates which would discourage borrowing and therefore reduce spending. Wait, no. If the money supply decreases, interest rates go up, not down. So B is talking about lower rates, which isn't what happens when money supply decreases.

Option C: Lower interest rates... Again, no. Money supply decrease leads to higher rates, so C is wrong.

Option D: Raise interest rates which would discourage borrowing and therefore increase spending. Hmm, higher rates discourage borrowing. If borrowing is discouraged, spending (like investment) goes down. So D says it would increase spending, which doesn't make sense. So D is probably wrong.

Option E: No impact on interest rates but increase spending. No, money supply changes should affect rates, so E is wrong.

Option F: No impact on rates, decrease spending. Again, money supply does affect rates, so F is incorrect.

Option G: Raise interest rates which would discourage borrowing and therefore reduce spending. This aligns with what I was thinking. Higher rates make borrowing expensive, so people and businesses borrow less, leading to less spending. So G looks correct.

Option H: Lower rates which encourage saving and reduce spending. No, rates go up, so H is wrong.

Option I: Raise rates encourage borrowing. Wait, no. Higher rates make borrowing more expensive, so they discourage borrowing, not encourage. So I is incorrect.

Option J: Lower rates encourage borrowing and increase spending. But again, rates don't lower when money supply decreases, so J is wrong.

So the correct answer should be G.

According to Keynesian theory, a decrease in the money supply leads to higher interest rates because money becomes scarcer. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, which discourages both businesses and consumers from borrowing. Reduced borrowing leads to decreased investment and consumption, thereby lowering overall spending and aggregate demand. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, C, D, E, F, H, I, J** are incorrect because they either misrepresent the direction of interest rate changes, the effects of interest rates on borrowing, or the impact on spending.
- **G** correctly states that a decrease in the money supply raises interest rates, discourages borrowing, and reduces spending.

**Answer: G**
