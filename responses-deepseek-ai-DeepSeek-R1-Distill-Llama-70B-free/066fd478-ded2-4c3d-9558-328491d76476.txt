Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about self-inductance. Hmm, I remember that self-inductance has to do with coils and back EMF. Let me think. Oh right, when the current in a coil changes, it induces a voltage called back EMF, and that's related to self-inductance.

The question says that a rate of change of current of 5 amperes per second produces a back EMF of 2 volts. I need to find the self-inductance. Wait, I think the formula connects these two. Oh yeah, Faraday's Law of Induction for a coil. The formula is EMF equals negative L times the rate of change of current, right? So, EMF = -L * (dI/dt). But since we're dealing with magnitudes here, I can probably ignore the negative sign for this calculation.

So the formula would be L = EMF divided by (dI/dt). Let me plug in the numbers they gave. The EMF is 2 volts, and the rate of change of current is 5 A/s. So L = 2V / 5A/s. Wait, volts divided by amperes per second. Oh yeah, because H (henry) is the unit of inductance, which is V*s/A. So 2 divided by 5 is 0.4. So 0.4 henrys.

Now I look at the options. Option A is 0.4 H. So the answer should be A. But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix anything up. Oh, right, the formula is straightforward. Back EMF is L times the rate of change, so dividing gives L. Yep, that's correct. So I'm confident it's A.

To calculate the self-inductance \( L \) of the coil, we use the relationship between back EMF (\( \mathcal{E} \)) and the rate of change of current (\( \frac{dI}{dt} \)):

\[
\mathcal{E} = L \cdot \frac{dI}{dt}
\]

Rearranging for \( L \):

\[
L = \frac{\mathcal{E}}{\frac{dI}{dt}}
\]

Given:
- \( \mathcal{E} = 2 \, \text{V} \)
- \( \frac{dI}{dt} = 5 \, \text{A/s} \)

Substituting the values:

\[
L = \frac{2}{5} = 0.4 \, \text{H}
\]

From the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A: 0.4 henry**
