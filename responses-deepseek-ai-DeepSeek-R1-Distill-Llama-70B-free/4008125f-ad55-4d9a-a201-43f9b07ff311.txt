Question:

Prior to the issuance of its December 31 financial statements Stark Co. was named as a defendant in a lawsuit arising from an event that occurred in October. Stark's legal counsel believes that it is reasonably possible that there will be an unfavorable outcome and that damages will range from $100000 to $150000. Which amount(s) should Stark accrue and/or disclose in its December 31 financial statements? Accrue contingent liability Disclose contingent liability

Options:

A: $150000 $0
B: $0 $150000

F: $100000 $0
G: $100000 $100000
H: $150000 $150000

Okay, so I have this accounting question about contingent liabilities. Hmm, I need to figure out what Stark Co. should do regarding their financial statements. Let me start by recalling what I know about contingent liabilities.

Contingent liabilities are potential obligations that depend on the outcome of some future event, like a lawsuit. The key here is to determine when a company should accrue the liability or just disclose it.

From what I remember, GAAP has specific rules for this. If the liability is probable and can be reasonably estimated, then the company should accrue it. If it's just possible, they disclose it. But wait, there's more to it. So, the levels are probable, possible, or remote.

In this question, Stark Co. is a defendant in a lawsuit. Their legal counsel thinks it's reasonably possible that the outcome will be unfavorable. So, reasonably possible means it's more than remote but less than probable. Oh, right, probable is defined as likely to occur, which is a higher threshold than possible.

The damages are estimated between $100,000 and $150,000. So the range is given. Now, since the outcome is only reasonably possible, Stark doesn't need to accrue the liability. Instead, they have to disclose the contingency in the financial statements.

Wait, but the question is about what they should accrue and/or disclose. So, since it's possible but not probable, they don't accrue anything. So the accrue part is $0. For disclosure, they should mention the range because it's a possible loss. So the disclosure would include the range of $100k to $150k.

Looking at the options, I need to find an option where the accrue amount is $0 and the disclosure includes the range. Let's see the options:

Option D: $0, $100k-$150k. That seems right. Option B is $0 accrue and $150k disclose, which doesn't include the range. So D is the correct choice.

Wait, but I should double-check. The FASB rules state that if a loss is probable and can be estimated, accrue it. If it's possible, disclose without accrual. If it's remote, no disclosure needed. Since here the outcome is reasonably possible, Stark only needs to disclose the range. So yes, the answer is D.

Under GAAP, contingent liabilities are handled based on their likelihood and the ability to estimate the potential loss. If a loss is probable (likely to occur) and can be reasonably estimated, the company must accrue the liability. If the loss is only reasonably possible, the company should disclose the contingency without accruing it. In this case, Stark Co.'s legal counsel assesses the outcome as "reasonably possible," meaning it is more than remote but less than probable. Therefore, Stark should not accrue any amount but must disclose the range of potential damages ($100,000 to $150,000) in its financial statements.

From the options provided, the correct choice is the one where the accrue amount is $0 and the disclosure includes the range of $100,000 to $150,000.

Answer: D
