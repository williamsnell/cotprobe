Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about pea plants. Let's see what it's asking. Hmm, it's about a homozygous tall pea plant crossed with a homozygous dwarf. The gene for tall is dominant. I need to find the expected F1 and F2 generations' phenotypic and genotypic results.

Alright, I remember that in Mendelian genetics, when you cross two homozygous parents, you get all the same genotype in the F1. So if one parent is homozygous tall (let's say DD) and the other is homozygous dwarf (dd), then the F1 should be all Dd, right? Because each parent can only contribute one allele. So the F1 generation's genotype would be all Dd. And since D is dominant, all of them would be tall. So phenotypically, all F1 are tall.

Now, moving on to the F2 generation. The F1 plants are Dd, so when they self-pollinate, each plant will produce gametes D and d. So the possible genotypes for F2 would be DD, Dd, and dd. The Punnett square would look like each parent can give D or d. So the combinations are DD (25%), Dd (50%), and dd (25%). 

Phenotypically, since D is dominant, both DD and Dd show the tall trait. So the ratio is 3/4 tall and 1/4 dwarf. So F2 should be 3:1 phenotypically.

Looking at the options now. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: F1 has 3/4 DD and 1/4 Dd. That doesn't seem right because if both parents are homozygous, F1 should all be Dd. So A is wrong.

Option B: F1 all DD. No, because parents are DD and dd, so F1 is Dd. So B is incorrect.

Option C: F1 is all Dd, which is correct. F2 has 1/4 DD, 1/2 Dd, 1/4 dd. Phenotype is 3/4 tall, 1/4 dwarf. Wait, that's exactly what I thought. So option C looks right.

Option D: F1 all dd? No, because the parents are tall and dwarf. F1 can't be all dd. So D is wrong.

Option E: F1 all DD. That can't be, because parents are DD and dd. So E is wrong.

Option F: F1 all dd? Again, no. Because the cross is between DD and dd, F1 is Dd, not dd. So F is wrong.

Option G: F1 has some DD and Dd, which would only be if parents weren't homozygous. So G is wrong.

Option H: F1 is all Dd. F2 has 1/2 DD, 1/4 Dd, 1/4 dd. So the genotype ratio is 1:0.5:0.25. Then the phenotype is 1/2 tall (since DD is tall, Dd is tall, and dd is dwarf). Wait, no. Because in F2, the ratio is 3:1, so phenotypically it should be 3/4 tall. So H's F2 phenotype is 1/2 tall, which is wrong. So H is incorrect.

Option I: F1 is all Dd. F2 is 1/2 DD and 1/2 Dd. So that's not the 25% DD, 50% Dd, 25% dd. So I is wrong.

Option J: F1 has some that are tall and dwarf, which can't be because F1 are all Dd and dominant tall. So J is wrong.

So the correct option is C. F1 is all Dd, all tall. F2 has genotypic ratio 1:2:1 (DD, Dd, dd), phenotypic ratio 3:1 (tall:dwarf). So option C matches.

The question involves a genetic cross between a homozygous tall pea plant (DD) and a homozygous dwarf pea plant (dd), where the tall allele (D) is dominant over the dwarf allele (d). The goal is to determine the expected phenotypic and genotypic results in the F₁ and F₂ generations.

### Analysis:
1. **F₁ Generation**:
   - When a homozygous tall plant (DD) is crossed with a homozygous dwarf plant (dd), all F₁ offspring will inherit one dominant allele (D) and one recessive allele (d), resulting in the genotype **Dd**.
   - Since the tall allele (D) is dominant, all F₁ plants will exhibit the tall phenotype.

2. **F₂ Generation**:
   - The F₁ plants (Dd) are self-pollinated. Each F₁ plant produces two types of gametes: D and d.
   - Using a Punnett square, the genotypic ratios in the F₂ generation will be **1/4 DD**, **1/2 Dd**, and **1/4 dd**.
   - Phenotypically, both DD and Dd will exhibit the tall trait (dominant), while only dd will exhibit the dwarf trait (recessive). Thus, the phenotypic ratio will be **3/4 tall** and **1/4 dwarf**.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. F₁ does not have a mix of genotypes (3/4 DD, 1/4 Dd); all F₁ are Dd.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. F₁ cannot be all DD because the cross is between DD and dd.
- **Option C**: Correct. F₁ is all Dd (tall), and F₂ has genotypic ratios of 1/4 DD, 1/2 Dd, 1/4 dd, with phenotypic ratios of 3/4 tall and 1/4 dwarf.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. F₁ cannot be all dd because the cross is between DD and dd.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. F₁ cannot be all DD because the cross is between DD and dd.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. F₁ cannot be all dd because the cross is between DD and dd.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. F₁ does not have a mix of genotypes (1/2 DD, 1/2 Dd); all F₁ are Dd.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. F₂ does not have a phenotypic ratio of 1/2 tall and 1/2 dwarf; the correct ratio is 3/4 tall and 1/4 dwarf.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. F₂ does not have a genotypic ratio of 1/2 DD and 1/2 Dd; the correct genotypic ratio is 1/4 DD, 1/2 Dd, 1/4 dd.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. F₁ does not have a mix of phenotypes (1/2 tall, 1/2 dwarf); all F₁ are tall.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **Option C**, as it accurately describes the F₁ and F₂ generations' genotypic and phenotypic results.
