Okay, I've got this question about DC machines and their windings. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

So the question is asking which winding is necessary in all DC machines. The options are A to J, each with different types of windings.

First, I remember that DC machines, like motors and generators, have different types of windings. The two main types I know are series, parallel, and something else... Oh right, maybe wave and lap windings. Wait, but what defines each?

Wave winding: In this, the armature coils are connected in a way that each coil is connected to the next one, forming a wave-like pattern. This usually results in the number of parallel paths being equal to 2, regardless of the number of poles. So if there are multiple poles, the parallel paths remain two. I think wave windings are used in certain applications, but not all.

Lap winding: This is another type where the coils are connected in a way that each pole has its own set of coils. The number of parallel paths here depends on the number of poles. So if there are P poles, there are P parallel paths. Lap windings are common in DC machines, especially when there are multiple poles.

Wait, but the question is about which winding is necessary in all DC machines. So I need to figure out which type is universally present.

Another thought: closed and open windings. Closed winding probably refers to the armature being connected in a way that the circuit is complete, whereas open might leave some ends open. But I'm not sure if that's a separate type.

Looking at the options again: A is star, which I think is another term for a Y connection, typically in three-phase systems, but not sure about DC. B is delta, same idea. C is closed winding, which might be a general term. D is parallel, which I think refers to how the armature coils are connected in parallel. E is zigzag, which I'm not familiar with. F is spiral, not sure. G is wave, H is open, I is lap, J is series.

So the question is about which is necessary in all DC machines. So maybe it's a type that's fundamental.

Wait, all DC machines have either a series, parallel, or compound winding. But the question is about the armature winding type, perhaps. Or maybe it's about the way the armature coils are connected.

Wait, I think in any DC machine, whether it's a motor or generator, the armature must have a certain type of winding. Lap and wave are types of armature windings. So which one is used in all cases?

No, that can't be because some use lap, some use wave. So the question must be about a different aspect.

Wait, maybe the question is about the type of winding configuration in terms of how the coils are arranged to form a closed loop. So closed winding (option C) would mean that the armature is a closed circuit, which is necessary for any DC machine to function because current has to flow.

Alternatively, looking at the options, option C is closed winding. So perhaps all DC machines require a closed winding because the armature needs to form a complete circuit for current to flow through the commutator and brushes.

Wait, but what's a closed winding exactly? I think in DC machines, the armature winding is closed, meaning the ends are connected to the commutator segments, forming a loop. So yes, any DC machine must have a closed winding arrangement. Otherwise, how would the current circulate?

So the answer would be C: closed winding.

But wait, what about open type winding (option H). That might refer to a situation where the winding isn't completing the circuit, which wouldn't work for a DC machine. So the necessary one is closed winding.

So the answer is C.

In DC machines, the armature winding must form a closed circuit to allow current to flow through the commutator and brushes. Among the given options, "closed winding" (option C) is the term that describes this essential feature. Without a closed winding, the DC machine would not function, as the current would not be able to circulate properly. Other types of windings, such as wave or lap, describe specific configurations but are not universally necessary for all DC machines. Therefore, the correct answer is:

C
