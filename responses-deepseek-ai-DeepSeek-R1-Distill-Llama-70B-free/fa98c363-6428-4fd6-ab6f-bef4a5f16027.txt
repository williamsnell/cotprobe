Okay, so I've got this problem about a transformer's efficiency under different load conditions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down step by step.

First, the transformer is a 10-kVA, 2300/230 volts, 60 Hz. They've given me data from two tests: open-circuit and short-circuit. Also, there's an ohmic resistance test. I think I need to use these to find the transformer's efficiency at two different scenarios: (a) rated kVA at unity power factor, and (b) half the rated kVA at a power factor of 0.6 leading.

Wait, right, the efficiency formula for a transformer is usually calculated as (output power) divided by (input power), right? But more accurately, it's (load kVA times the load voltage times the load current times the power factor) divided by (the same for input), but wait, no, efficiency is typically output over input. Alternatively, it's often calculated using the formula:

Efficiency (η) = (rated kVA * load PF) / (rated kVA * load PF + losses)

Hmm, no, wait. The losses in the transformer are made up of the core losses (which are a function of voltage) and the copper losses (which depend on the current squared). So the total losses are the sum of the iron losses (Pc) and the copper losses (I²R). 

I remember that the open-circuit test gives the core or iron losses, and the short-circuit test gives the copper losses. So the data from these tests will help me find the parameters needed for the efficiency calculation.

Let me jot down the given data:

Open-circuit test (low side input, 230 V):
- Voltage (V1) = 230 V
- Current (I0) = 0.62 A
- Power (Wc) = 69 W

Short-circuit test (high side input, 127 V):
- Voltage (Vsc) = 127 V
- Current (Isc) = 4.9 A
- Power (Psc) = 263 W

Ohmic resistance test:
- Low side: 1.89 V DC, 41.0 A DC
- High side: 23.4 V DC, so R_e1 (equivalent resistance referred to primary) is 10.9 ohms.
- Rated current on secondary side, I2' = 4.35 A.
- Pc (core losses) is given as 69 W.

Wait, but I thought the open-circuit test gives the core losses. So Pc would be the power measured in the open-circuit test. Yes, that makes sense.

Now, the equivalent resistance R_e1 is given as 10.9 ohms. Hmm, maybe that's the primary's equivalent resistance. Because in the ohmic test, they probably measured the resistance on the low side (primary) and high side (secondary), but perhaps R_e1 refers to the primary.

So, the total losses (P_loss) are Pc + P_cu, where P_cu is the copper losses. Copper losses depend on the load current, I² R. But I need to find R correctly.

Wait, the equivalent resistance is R_e1 = 10.9 ohms on the primary side. So when calculating copper losses, it's (I1)^2 * R_e1, where I1 is the primary current under load.

But wait, for the short-circuit test, the power Psc is equal to the copper losses when the transformer is shorted. So Psc = I_sc^2 * R_eq, where R_eq is the equivalent resistance as seen from the primary.

Wait, but in the short-circuit test, the voltage applied is to the high side. So maybe the R_eq is referred to the high side. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Let me think again. The short-circuit test measures the series impedance of the transformer. The power measured in the short-circuit test is the copper losses plus a little bit of core loss, but usually, the core loss is negligible because the voltage is much lower than the rated. So Psc is approximately equal to the copper losses when the transformer is under short-circuit.

So, in the short-circuit test, the voltage applied is 127 V on the high side, which is much lower than the rated 2300 V. So the magnetizing current is negligible, and the power Psc (263 W) is approximately the copper losses.

So the copper losses at full load would be higher than this because the current is higher.

Wait, no. The short-circuit test gives the losses at a particular current. So the full-load current on the high side is I2' rated = 4.35 A. Wait, what's the relationship between the short-circuit current and the rated current?

In the short-circuit test, the current was 4.9 A on the high side when 127 V was applied. So the rated current is 4.35 A, which is a bit lower. Hmm, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I'm looking at the wrong side.

Wait, the transformer is a step-down transformer. So the high voltage side is 2300 V, and the low side is 230 V.

In the short-circuit test, they applied 127 V to the high side. So the current on the high side would be 4.9 A. Let me find the equivalent resistance on the high side.

Wait, the short-circuit test gives the series impedance. So Z_eq = V_sc / I_sc. So for the high side, Z_eq_high = 127 V / 4.9 A ≈ 25.918 ohms.

But resistance is a part of impedance, so if we neglect the reactance (maybe because it's a transformer with a small series reactance), then R_eq_high ≈ 25.918 ohms.

But wait, the ohmic resistance test gives R_e1 = 10.9 ohms on the primary side. So perhaps R_e1 is the equivalent resistance referred to the primary. Wait, that would make sense because the ohmic test measures the resistance on the primary when the secondary is shorted. So R_e1 is the primary's equivalent resistance.

Alternatively, the ohmic resistance test measures the DC resistance of the primary and secondary windings. So the 1.89 V at 41 A on the low side gives a primary resistance R1 = V/I = 1.89 / 41 ≈ 0.0461 ohms. Similarly, on the high side, 23.4 V at some current gives R2 = 23.4 / (I2), but wait, the current on the high side when applying DC would be the same as the primary current because it's a DC test. Wait, no, in DC, the transformer's magnetizing inductance is shorted, so the current flows through both windings. So the total resistance would be the sum of primary and secondary resistances, but I might be complicating things.

Wait, perhaps the ohmic test is done by applying a DC voltage to one winding and measuring the current, then calculating the resistance for each winding separately. So for the low side (primary), V=1.89 V, I=41 A, so R1 = 1.89/41 ≈ 0.0461 ohms.

Similarly, on the high side, V=23.4 V, I=... but wait, the problem states aV2 = 2300 V, I2' = 4.35 A, and R_e1 = 10.9 ohms. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should proceed with the data I have.

So, the core loss Pc is 69 W, as given.

For the copper losses, I think the short-circuit test gives the copper losses at the short-circuit current. So when the transformer is under short-circuit, the copper loss is Psc = 263 W. But that's at a current of 4.9 A on the high side.

Wait, but the rated current on the high side is I2' = 4.35 A, which is less than 4.9 A. Hmm, that would imply that the short-circuit test was done at a higher current than the rated current, which makes sense because shorting the secondary would cause higher currents.

So, the copper losses under rated current would be less than Psc. So, how do I find the copper losses at rated current?

I think the copper losses are proportional to the square of the current. So if I can find the ratio of the rated current to the short-circuit current, I can scale the Psc accordingly.

Wait, but in the short-circuit test, the current was 4.9 A on the high side, while the rated current is 4.35 A. So the ratio is (4.35 / 4.9)^2.

So, P_cu_rated = Psc * (I_rated / I_sc)^2 = 263 W * (4.35 / 4.9)^2.

Let me calculate that:

4.35 / 4.9 ≈ 0.8878.

Squared is approximately 0.788.

So 263 * 0.788 ≈ 207.3 W.

Wait, but wait a minute, I'm a bit confused here. Because the short-circuit test's Psc is the copper loss when the current is I_sc. So the copper loss at any current I is P_cu = (I^2 / I_sc^2) * Psc.

So yes, that's correct. So at rated current I2' =4.35 A, the copper loss would be (4.35/4.9)^2 * 263 W.

So that's approximately 207.3 W.

Wait, but I'm not sure if this is necessary because the problem gives R_e1 as 10.9 ohms. Maybe I should calculate the copper loss using R_e1 and the rated current.

Because R_e1 is the equivalent resistance referred to the primary, so the copper loss at rated current would be I1^2 * R_e1.

Wait, but the rated current on the primary is different. Because the transformer is 10 kVA, the rated primary current I1_rated is S/(V1) = 10,000 VA / 230 V ≈ 43.48 A.

So R_e1 is 10.9 ohms, so copper loss is (43.48)^2 * 10.9. Wait that's way too high. Because 43^2 is 1849, times 10.9 would be around 20,000 watts. That can't be right.

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing up the primary and secondary here. Because R_e1 is the equivalent resistance referred to the primary, so the copper losses are the sum of the primary and secondary copper losses. But perhaps it's better to think in terms of the secondary current.

Wait, the rated secondary current is 4.35 A. So the equivalent resistance referred to the secondary would be R_e2 = (R_e1) * (a^2), where a is the turns ratio.

Wait, the turns ratio a = V1 / V2 = 230 / 2300 = 0.1.

So R_e2 = R_e1 * a² = 10.9 * (0.1)^2 = 10.9 * 0.01 = 0.109 ohms.

Then, the copper loss at rated current I2 =4.35 A is I2² * R_e2 = (4.35)^2 * 0.109 ≈ 18.92 * 0.109 ≈ 2.06 W.

Wait, that's way too low. Earlier, using the short-circuit test, I got around 207 W, which is much higher. So I'm getting conflicting results here. I must be doing something wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps R_e1 is the total equivalent resistance, including both primary and secondary. So when the current flows through both, the total copper loss is I1² R1 + I2² R2, but using the equivalent resistance referred to one side.

Hmm, maybe I should use the short-circuit test data correctly. The short-circuit test gives the total copper losses as Psc = I_sc² (R_eq), where R_eq is the equivalent resistance as seen from the side where the voltage is applied.

In the short-circuit test, voltage was applied to the high side (2300 V side), so R_eq_high = V_sc / I_sc = 127 V / 4.9 A ≈ 25.918 ohms.

So the equivalent resistance referred to the high side is about 25.918 ohms.

Then, the copper loss at rated current on the high side (I2_rated =4.35 A) is P_cu = I2² * R_eq_high = (4.35)^2 * 25.918 ≈ 18.92 *25.918 ≈ 490 W.

Wait, that's a lot higher than the earlier method. Hmm, but I'm not sure which approach is correct.

Wait, another approach is to calculate the full-load copper loss using the short-circuit test data. The formula is:

P_cu = (I2_rated / I2_sc)^2 * Psc.

Where I2_rated is 4.35 A, and I2_sc is 4.9 A.

So P_cu = (4.35/4.9)^2 * 263 W ≈ (0.8878)^2 *263 ≈ 0.788 *263 ≈ 207 W.

That seems more reasonable.

So, total losses at rated load (kVA, pf=1) would be Pc + P_cu = 69 W + 207 W = 276 W.

The output power at rated kVA and pf=1 is 10 kVA * 1 = 10,000 W.

But wait, efficiency is output over input. Input is output plus losses.

So η = output / (output + losses) = 10,000 / (10,000 + 276) ≈ 10,000/10,276 ≈ 0.973, or 97.3%.

Wait, but let me double-check. Output is 10,000 W, input is 10,000 + 276 = 10,276 W. So 10,000/10,276 ≈ 0.973 → 97.3% efficiency for part (a).

Now, moving to part (b), which is half the rated kVA (5 kVA) and pf=0.6 leading.

First, the core loss remains the same, 69 W, because it's voltage-dependent and voltage is at rated.

The copper loss will depend on the load current. Since the load is 5 kVA, the current on the secondary would be 5,000 VA / 230 V ≈ 21.74 A. Wait, wait no, the rated current on the secondary is 4.35 A at full load (10 kVA). So 5 kVA would be half the rated current, so I2 = 2.175 A.

Wait, no. The rated secondary current I2_rated = S / V2 = 10,000 / 230 ≈ 43.48 A? Wait, wait no, I'm getting confused with the sides.

Wait, the transformer is 2300 V (primary) to 230 V (secondary). So the rated secondary current is 10,000 VA / 230 V ≈ 43.48 A.

But wait, the problem says I2' rated is 4.35 A. Wait, that can't be right. Oh, wait, perhaps I2' is the current referred to the primary side. Hmm, no, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the turns ratio. The turns ratio a = V1 / V2 = 230 / 2300 = 0.1. So the current ratio is inverse, a' = V2 / V1 = 10.

So, the secondary current is 10 times the primary current. So if the primary current is I1, then I2 = I1 * a'.

Wait, but in the problem statement, I2' rated is 4.35 A. I think that's the rated current on the secondary side, because it's denoted as I2'.

So if I2' rated =4.35 A, then the primary current I1_rated would be I2' / a' = 4.35 /10 = 0.435 A.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because a 10 kVA transformer with 230 V on the secondary would draw 10,000/230 ≈ 43.48 A on the secondary. So I'm getting conflicting data here, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the given I2' is the rated current referred to the primary. Wait, that would be a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the data given in the problem is for when the transformer is operated at the low voltage side as the primary. Wait, the open-circuit test was done with input to the low side, so maybe the 230 V is primary in that case.

Wait, the problem says it's a 10 kVA, 2300/230 volts transformer. So 2300 V is the high voltage (primary) and 230 V is the secondary.

But in the open-circuit test, input was to the low side, so V1=230 V (so treating the secondary as the primary for the test). That's a bit confusing, but perhaps the test data is given with the low side as the primary in the tests.

Wait, perhaps it's better to proceed with the given data. So core loss is 69 W.

For part (a), full load, pf=1.

We calculated the copper loss as 207 W, so total loss 276 W. Output is 10,000 W. So efficiency 10,000/(10,000 + 276) ≈ 97.3%.

For part (b), half of rated kVA, so 5 kVA, and pf=0.6 leading.

First, the output power is 5,000 W * 0.6 = 3,000 W.

Wait, no, wait. Efficiency is based on output power and input power. The output is S * pf, which is 5 kVA * 0.6 = 3 kW. But the losses include core loss and copper loss.

Wait, at half load, the current is half of rated current. So copper loss would be (0.5)^2 times the full-load copper loss. Wait, but earlier we found full-load copper loss as 207 W, so half load would be (0.5)^2 * 207 = 0.25 * 207 = 51.75 W.

Wait, but wait, in part (a), copper loss was 207 W at full load. So at half load (5 kVA), the current is half, so copper loss is (0.5)^2 * 207 = 51.75 W.

So total loss is Pc + P_cu = 69 + 51.75 = 120.75 W.

But output is 5,000
