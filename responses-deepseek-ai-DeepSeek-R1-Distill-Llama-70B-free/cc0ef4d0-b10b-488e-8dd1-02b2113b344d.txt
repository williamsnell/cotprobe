Question:

The mean ionic activity coefficient of an electrolyte in a dilute solution is given approximately by ln \gamma_\pm = - A\surd(m) where m is the molality and A is a constant. Using the Gibbs-Duhem equation find the activity coefficient \gamma_1 of the solvent in this dilute solution in terms of A, m, and constants characteristic of the solvent and solute. Ob-serve that ln X_1 = ln [(n_1) / (n_1 + mv)] = ln [(1) / {(1 + mv) / n_1}] \approx - [(mv) / (n_1)] where v is the number of ions in the formula (for example v = 2 for NaCl) and n_1 is the number of moles of solvent in 1000 g of solvent. All quantities except \gamma_1 , the un-known, can thus be expressed in terms of the variable m.

Options:

A: \gamma_1 = e[{(Av^2) / (3n_1)} m^3/2]
B: \gamma_1 = e[{(Av^2) / (2n_1)} m^3/2]
C: \gamma_1 = e[{(Av) / (3n_1)} m^3/2]
D: \gamma_1 = e[{(Av) / (3n_1^2)} m^3/2]
E: \gamma_1 = [{(Av) / (3n_1)} m^3/2]
F: \gamma_1 = [{(Av^2) / (3n_1)} m^3/2]
G: \gamma_1 = [{(A) / (n_1v)} m^3/2]
H: \gamma_1 = e[{(A) / (2n_1v^2)} m^3/2]
I: \gamma_1 = e[{(A) / (3n_1v)} m^3/2]

Okay, so I've got this problem about activity coefficients and the Gibbs-Duhem equation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem states that the mean ionic activity coefficient of an electrolyte in a dilute solution is given by ln γ± = -A√m, where m is the molality and A is a constant. I need to find the activity coefficient of the solvent, γ₁, using the Gibbs-Duhem equation.

Wait, what's the Gibbs-Duhem equation again? I remember it's related to the changes in chemical potentials or activities in a solution. Oh right, it relates the chemical potentials of the components in a solution. For a binary solution (solvent and solute), the equation should link the activity coefficients of the solvent and the solute.

In a solution, the Gibbs-Duhem equation is often written in terms of the chemical potentials. But since we're dealing with activity coefficients, I think it can be expressed as:

n₁ d(ln γ₁) + n₂ d(ln γ₂) = 0

Where n₁ and n₂ are the moles of solvent and solute, respectively. But wait, for an electrolyte solution, especially when the solute dissociates into ions, things might get a bit more complicated. Oh right, because the solute dissociates into v ions, so the total number of particles increases.

Wait, in the problem statement, they mentioned that the solvent's activity can be approximated using ln X₁ ≈ - (mv)/n₁, where X₁ is the mole fraction of the solvent. Because X₁ is (n₁)/(n₁ + v n₂), assuming the solute dissociates into v ions. So when the solution is dilute, n₂ is much smaller than n₁, so we can approximate the denominator as n₁(1 + (v n₂)/n₁), and ln of that is approximately -(v n₂)/(n₁), which is where that expression comes from.

But wait, n₂ is the moles of solute. Since molality m is moles of solute per kg of solvent, and in 1000g (1kg), n₂ = m (assuming the solvent is water, which has a molar mass close to 18g/mol, but maybe it's considered in terms of kg here).

Wait, actually, the problem states that n₁ is the number of moles of solvent in 1000g of solvent. So for 1kg of solvent, n₁ is fixed, right? So n₂, the moles of solute, would be m (molality) times the kg of solvent, which is 1, so n₂ = m * 1 = m.

Wait no, no. Wait, the molality m is moles of solute per kg of solvent. So in 1 kg of solvent, you have m moles of solute. So the total number of moles of solute particles is m multiplied by v, since each formula unit dissociates into v ions. So when considering the mole fraction of the solvent, it's n₁ divided by (n₁ + v m). Because each mole of solute gives v moles of ions.

So the mole fraction of the solvent, X₁, is approximately 1 when the solution is dilute, but we can expand it. The problem gives ln X₁ ≈ - (v m) / n₁. That makes sense because if you have X₁ ≈ 1 - (v m)/n₁, then ln(1 - x) ≈ -x for small x.

So the activity of the solvent is a₁ = γ₁ X₁. Taking the natural log, ln a₁ = ln γ₁ + ln X₁. So ln γ₁ = ln a₁ - ln X₁. But wait, I'm not sure if that's the right approach. Alternatively, the activity coefficient is defined such that a₁ = γ₁ X₁, so ln a₁ = ln γ₁ + ln X₁, but I'm not sure if that's directly helpful here.

The Gibbs-Duhem equation for a two-component system (solvent and solute) is:

n₁ dμ₁ + n₂ dμ₂ = 0

But in terms of activity coefficients, since μ = μ° + RT ln a, where a is the activity. So for the solvent, a₁ = γ₁ X₁, and for the solute, considering it's an electrolyte, the activity is a_±^v? Or more accurately, the mean ionic activity is γ±^v.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to express the Gibbs-Duhem equation in terms of the activity coefficients. For a binary solution where the solute dissociates into v ions, the Gibbs-Duhem equation can be written as:

(1 + v) n₂ d ln γ_± + n₁ d ln γ₁ = 0

Wait, is that right? Let me think. Each mole of solute produces v ions, so the total number of moles of solute particles is v times n₂. So the equation would account for all particles. So the general form is Σn_i dμ_i =0. For solvent, it's n₁ dμ₁. For solute, it's n₂ dμ_solute. But the solute dissociates into v ions, so the chemical potential of the solute is related to the mean ionic activity.

Alternatively, I've seen the Gibbs-Duhem equation expressed as:

n₁ d ln γ₁ + v n₂ d ln γ_± = 0

Wait, that seems more likely. Because each mole of solute contributes v ions, each with activity γ_±, so the total for the solute is v n₂ d ln γ_±.

So the equation would be:

n₁ d ln γ₁ + v n₂ d ln γ_± = 0

But I'm not entirely sure about the exact form. Let me double-check. If the solute dissociates into v ions, the total number of particles is n₁ (solvent) + v n₂ (ions from solute). The Gibbs-Duhem equation in terms of activities would consider each component's contribution.

Wait, another approach: the Gibbs-Duhem equation in terms of the solvent and the electrolyte before dissociation. So treating the solute as a single component but considering its dissociation. Then, the equation is written as n₁ d ln γ₁ + n₂ d ln γ_solute = 0. But the activity of the solute, γ_solute, is related to the mean ionic activity coefficient, which is (γ_±)^v.

So, the activity of the solute is a_solute = (a_±)^v = (γ_±^v) (m^v), assuming it's a strong electrolyte and fully dissociates. So ln a_solute = v ln γ_± + v ln m.

But in the Gibbs-Duhem equation, we have:

n₁ d ln γ₁ + n₂ d (ln a_solute) = 0

Wait, no. The Gibbs-Duhem equation is:

n₁ dμ₁ + n₂ dμ₂ = 0

But μ₁ = μ₁° + RT ln a₁ and μ₂ = μ₂° + RT ln a₂, where a₂ is the activity of the solute. So:

n₁ RT d ln a₁ + n₂ RT d ln a₂ = 0

Dividing both sides by RT:

n₁ d ln a₁ + n₂ d ln a₂ = 0

Now, a₁ = γ₁ X₁, and a₂ = (γ_±)^v m^v. Wait, no, for the activity of the solute, if it's a 1:v electrolyte, the mean activity a_± is (γ_±) m, but the activity of the entire solute would be a_±^v. Or alternatively, perhaps a₂ = (γ_±)^v (m)^v. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating things here.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to express the Gibbs-Duhem equation for the solution considering the ions. So the solution has solvent (component 1) and v ions from the solute (component 2). But the solute is a single component before dissociation. So the Gibbs-Duhem equation in terms of the solvent and the solute (as a single component) would involve their activities.

Wait, perhaps I should stick with the initial approach. The Gibbs-Duhem equation for a binary solution (solvent and solute, considering the solute's dissociation) is:

n₁ d ln γ₁ + v n₂ d ln γ_± = 0

Because each mole of solute contributes v moles of ions, each with activity coefficient γ_±.

So, if that's the case, then:

n₁ d ln γ₁ = - v n₂ d ln γ_±

Now, we can integrate this equation to find ln γ₁.

But wait, the variables are functions of m, the molality. So integrating from m=0 (pure solvent) to some m.

So let's write it as:

d ln γ₁ = [ -v n₂ / n₁ ] d ln γ_±

We need to express n₂ in terms of m. Since n₂ is the moles of solute in 1 kg of solvent, n₂ = m (because molality m = moles of solute per kg solvent). So n₂ = m.

So substituting:

d ln γ₁ = [ -v m / n₁ ] d ln γ_±

But we know that ln γ_± is given by ln γ_± = -A sqrt(m)

So d ln γ_± = d(-A m^{1/2}) ) = -A (1/2) m^{-1/2} dm

Substituting that into the equation:

d ln γ₁ = [ -v m / n₁ ] * [ -A (1/2) m^{-1/2} dm ]

Simplify the signs and terms:

The two negatives make a positive. So:

d ln γ₁ = (v m / n₁) * (A/2) m^{-1/2} dm

Simplify m terms: m * m^{-1/2} = m^{1/2}

So:

d ln γ₁ = (v A) / (2 n₁) ) m^{1/2} dm

Now, integrate both sides from m=0 to m. At m=0, γ₁=1 (pure solvent), so ln γ₁=0.

Integrate:

ln γ₁ = ∫ (v A) / (2 n₁) ) m^{1/2} dm from 0 to m

The integral of m^{1/2} dm is (2/3) m^{3/2}

So:

ln γ₁ = (v A) / (2 n₁) ) * (2/3) m^{3/2}

The 2's cancel out:

ln γ₁ = (v A) / (3 n₁) ) m^{3/2}

Wait, but wait! What about the v in the numerator? Because the equation after substitution had v m /n₁ times A/2 m^{-1/2}.

Wait, let me recheck:

Yes, [v m /n₁ ] * [A/2 m^{-1/2}] = (v A m^{1/2}) )/( 2 n₁ )

Then integrating from 0 to m, gives (v A)/(2 n₁) * (2/3 m^{3/2}) )

The 2's cancel, leaving (v A)/(3 n₁) m^{3/2}

So, ln γ₁ = (v A m^{3/2}) )/(3 n₁ )

Wait, but looking back at the options, I don't see any option with a v multiplied in. Wait, looking at the options again.

Wait, the options have terms like Av^2, Av, etc. So perhaps I made a mistake in the treatment.

Wait, let me go back. Maybe I messed up the Gibbs-Duhem equation. Let me think again about the setup.

The Gibbs-Duhem equation can also be expressed in terms of the solvent and the solute, considering that the solute dissociates into v ions. So the equation becomes:

n₁ d ln γ₁ + v n₂ d ln γ_± = 0

Because each mole of solute contributes v ions, each with their own activity coefficient. So the total for the solute is v n₂ d ln γ_±.

So, substituting, we have:

n₁ d ln γ₁ = - v n₂ d ln γ_±

Which is the same as before.

Now, n₂ is the number of moles of solute, which is m (since m is molality, moles per kg solvent, and we're considering 1 kg solvent, so n₂ = m).

So substituting n₂ = m, the equation becomes:

d ln γ₁ = [ -v m / n₁ ] d ln γ_±

As before.

Now, ln γ_± is given as -A sqrt(m), so d ln γ_± = (-A) * (1/(2 sqrt(m))) dm

So substituting:

d ln γ₁ = [ -v m / n₁ ] * [ (-A) (1/(2 sqrt(m))) dm ]

The negatives multiply to give positive. So:

d ln γ₁ = [v m A ]/(2 n₁ sqrt(m)) ) dm

Simplify m / sqrt(m) = sqrt(m), so:

d ln γ₁ = (v A sqrt(m)) )/(2 n₁ ) dm

Now, integrate both sides from m=0 to m.

So,

ln γ₁ = ∫ (v A)/(2 n₁) ) sqrt(m) dm evaluated from 0 to m.

The integral of sqrt(m) dm is (2/3) m^{3/2}

So,

ln γ₁ = (v A)/(2 n₁) ) * (2/3) m^{3/2}

The 2's cancel, giving:

ln γ₁ = (v A) / (3 n₁) ) m^{3/2}

Hmm, but looking at the options, none of them directly match this expression. Let me look again.

Wait, the options are for γ₁, and they involve exponentials when they have an 'e' in them. So to get γ₁, I need to exponentiate both sides.

So,

γ₁ = exp( (v A m^{3/2}) / (3 n₁) )

Looking at the options, let's see which one matches this.

Option A: e^{(Av²)/(3n₁) m^{3/2}} → No, because we have v*A, not Av².

Option B: e^{(Av²)/(2n₁) m^{3/2}} → No.

Option C: e^{(Av)/(3n₁) m^{3/2}} → Yes, this matches. Because v*A/(3n₁) times m^{3/2}.

So, option C is γ₁ = e^{(Av)/(3n₁) m^{3/2}}.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the algebra because sometimes I might have mixed up v and the other variables.

Wait, in the problem statement, the approximation is given as ln X₁ ≈ - (mv)/n₁. So that's where the v comes in. But in the Gibbs-Duhem step, I correctly accounted for v in the equation.

Wait, but in the options, option C is e^{(Av)/(3n1) m^{3/2}}.

Yes, that's exactly what we have. So the correct answer should be option C.

Wait, but looking again at the options, option C is written as e^{(Av)/(3n_1)} m^{3/2}.

Wait, the way it's written in the options is as exponents with terms multiplied. So option C is e^{(Av)/(3n₁)} m^{3/2}, but that's not correct because the exponent should be (Av m^{3/2})/(3n₁).

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option C: \gamma_1 = e^{(Av)/(3n_1)} m^{3/2}

Wait, no, that would mean e raised to (Av)/(3n₁) multiplied by m^{3/2}, which is incorrect because the exponent should include the m term.

Hmm, that can't be right because units wouldn't match. So perhaps the correct option is the one where the exponent includes m^{3/2}.

Wait, looking again, perhaps I made a mistake in the options. Let me read the options carefully.

Options:

A: e^{(Av^2)/(3n_1)} m^{3/2}

Wait, no, the way the options are written uses exponents. Let me look at each option:

Option C: \gamma_1 = e^{(Av)/(3n_1)} m^{3/2} → No, because the exponent is (Av)/(3n₁), and then multiplied by m^{3/2}, which is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the options. Maybe the exponent includes the m^{3/2} term.

Looking again:

Option C: \gamma_1 = e[{(Av) / (3n_1)} m^3/2]

Ah, yes, in LaTeX, it's written as e^{...}, where the exponent is (Av m^{3/2})/(3n₁). So option C is correct.

So the correct answer is option C.

The problem involves finding the activity coefficient of the solvent, γ₁, in a dilute electrolyte solution using the Gibbs-Duhem equation. The mean ionic activity coefficient of the solute is given as ln γ_± = -A√m, where m is the molality and A is a constant. The Gibbs-Duhem equation for a binary solution, considering the dissociation of the solute into v ions, is:

\[
n₁ \, d(\ln \gamma₁) + v n₂ \, d(\ln \gamma_±) = 0
\]

Here, \(n₁\) is the number of moles of solvent, and \(n₂ = m\) is the number of moles of solute (since molality \(m\) is defined as moles of solute per kg of solvent). Substituting \(n₂ = m\) and rearranging:

\[
d(\ln \gamma₁) = -\frac{v m}{n₁} \, d(\ln \gamma_±)
\]

Given \(\ln \gamma_± = -A\sqrt{m}\), we find:

\[
d(\ln \gamma_±) = -\frac{A}{2} m^{-1/2} \, dm
\]

Substituting this into the equation for \(d(\ln \gamma₁)\):

\[
d(\ln \gamma₁) = \frac{v A}{2 n₁} m^{1/2} \, dm
