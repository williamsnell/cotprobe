Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about wave transmission and refraction. Hmm, I remember that when a wave goes from one medium to another, it changes direction based on something called Snell's Law. Let me think. Oh right, Snell's Law relates the angles of incidence and refraction with the refractive indices of the two media involved.

The problem says that polystyrene has a relative permittivity of 2.7. Wait, relative permittivity is another term for the dielectric constant, right? So, the relative permittivity ε_r is 2.7 for polystyrene. But wait, when using Snell's Law, do I need the refractive index or the permittivity? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Oh, right! The refractive index n is the square root of the relative permittivity when the wave is in a non-magnetic medium. Since polystyrene is a non-magnetic material, n = sqrt(ε_r). So for polystyrene, n = sqrt(2.7). Let me calculate that... sqrt(2.7) is approximately 1.643. Yeah, that's right.

Now, the wave is incident from air onto polystyrene. Air has a relative permittivity close to 1, so its refractive index is n_air = sqrt(1) = 1.0.

The incident angle theta_i is 30 degrees. So, using Snell's Law: n_air * sin(theta_i) = n_polystyrene * sin(theta_t). Plugging the numbers in: 1.0 * sin(30°) = 1.643 * sin(theta_t). Sin(30) is 0.5, so 0.5 = 1.643 * sin(theta_t). Solving for sin(theta_t): sin(theta_t) = 0.5 / 1.643 ≈ 0.304. Then theta_t is the arcsin of that. Let me compute that. Arcsin(0.304) is about 17.7 degrees. So the transmitted angle is approximately 17.7 degrees when going from air to polystyrene.

But wait, the question says to interchange polystyrene and air and repeat the calculation. Oh right, so now the wave is going the other way—incident from polystyrene onto air. So now, the initial medium is polystyrene (n = 1.643) and the second medium is air (n = 1.0). The incident angle in this case is the same as the previous transmitted angle? Or wait, no, the incident angle here is the same as before, which is 30 degrees. Wait, no, no. Wait, when you interchange the media, the wave is now incident from polystyrene into air. So the incident angle is theta_i = 30 degrees, but wait, in this scenario, is it the same 30 degrees? Hmm, wait. Let me think carefully. The first part is air to polystyrene, theta_i=30, theta_t=17.7. Now, the second part is polystyrene to air, but what's the incident angle? Oh, wait, the question says to calculate the angle of transmission when interchanging the media. So the setup is reversed: the wave now comes from polystyrene (n=1.643) and is incident on air (n=1.0). The incident angle is still 30 degrees, but now when it's going from higher refractive index to lower. 

So applying Snell's Law again: n_polystyrene * sin(theta_i) = n_air * sin(theta_t). So 1.643 * sin(30°) = 1.0 * sin(theta_t). Sin(30) is 0.5, so 1.643 * 0.5 = 0.8215 = sin(theta_t). So theta_t is arcsin(0.8215). What's that value? Let me think. Arcsin(0.82) is about 55 degrees. Because sin(55) is approximately 0.819, which is close to 0.8215. So theta_t is approximately 55.2 degrees.

So the two angles are approximately 17.7 degrees and 55.2 degrees. Let me look at the options.

Option F is 17.7 and 55.2. So that must be the correct answer. Wait, let me double-check. 

Wait, when you have the first case, air to polystyrene: n1=1, n2=1.643. So Snell's law: 1* sin(theta_i)=1.643*sin(theta_t). So theta_t is smaller, which makes sense because when moving to a higher refractive index, the transmitted angle is smaller. So 17.7 degrees is correct.

In the second case, going from polystyrene (n=1.643) to air (n=1). So Snell's law: 1.643 * sin(30) = 1 * sin(theta_t). So sin(theta_t)= (1.643 * 0.5)/1 = 0.8215. Arcsin(0.8215) is approximately 55.2 degrees. That's exactly what I got earlier.

So the correct answer should be F: 17.7 and 55.2.

To solve the problem, we use Snell's Law, which relates the angles of incidence and refraction to the refractive indices of the two media involved. The refractive index \( n \) is the square root of the relative permittivity \( \varepsilon_r \). For polystyrene, \( \varepsilon_r = 2.7 \), so \( n_{\text{polystyrene}} = \sqrt{2.7} \approx 1.643 \). Air has \( n_{\text{air}} = 1.0 \).

### Case 1: Wave incident from air onto polystyrene
Using Snell's Law:
\[
n_{\text{air}} \sin(\theta_i) = n_{\text{polystyrene}} \sin(\theta_t)
\]
Substituting \( n_{\text{air}} = 1.0 \), \( \theta_i = 30^\circ \), and \( n_{\text{polystyrene}} = 1.643 \):
\[
1.0 \cdot \sin(30^\circ) = 1.643 \cdot \sin(\theta_t)
\]
\[
\sin(\theta_t) = \frac{\sin(30^\circ)}{1.643} = \frac{0.5}{1.643} \approx 0.304
\]
\[
\theta_t = \arcsin(0.304) \approx 17.7^\circ
\]

### Case 2: Wave incident from polystyrene onto air
Now, the wave is traveling from polystyrene (\( n = 1.643 \)) to air (\( n = 1.0 \)). Using Snell's Law again:
\[
n_{\text{polystyrene}} \sin(\theta_i) = n_{\text{air}} \sin(\theta_t)
\]
Substituting \( n_{\text{polystyrene}} = 1.643 \), \( \theta_i = 30^\circ \), and \( n_{\text{air}} = 1.0 \):
\[
1.643 \cdot \sin(30^\circ) = 1.0 \cdot \sin(\theta_t)
\]
\[
\sin(\theta_t) = 1.643 \cdot \sin(30^\circ) = 1.643 \cdot 0.5 = 0.8215
\]
\[
\theta_t = \arcsin(0.8215) \approx 55.2^\circ
\]

### Final Answer
The angles of transmission are approximately \( 17.7^\circ \) (air to polystyrene) and \( 55.2^\circ \) (polystyrene to air). Comparing these results with the options, the correct choice is:

**F: 17.7 degrees and 55.2 degrees**
