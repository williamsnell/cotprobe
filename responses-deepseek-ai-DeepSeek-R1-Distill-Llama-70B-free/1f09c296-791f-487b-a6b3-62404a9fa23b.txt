Question:

A buyer purchased a gallon of nonfat milk from a market. The milk, which was sold in a plastic container, had been processed and packaged by a dairy. That evening, the buyer was preparing dinner and poured himself a glass of milk from the container purchased at the market. He then sat down to eat his meal and proceeded to take a mouthful of milk. As he did so, the buyer felt something furry lodge in his mouth. He immediately spat out the furry object and saw that it was a dead mouse. The buyer suffered severe emotional distress but did not suffer any physical illness or injury. If the buyer asserts a claim against the dairy based on negligent manufacturing, he will most likely

Options:

A: not recover, because the dairy's negligence only caused mental disturbance.
B: recover, under the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.
C: not recover, because the dairy cannot be proven to have been the source of the mouse.
D: recover, under the theory of strict liability.
E: recover, because he suffered severe emotional distress.
F: recover, because the dairy breached its duty of care by failing to properly package the milk.
G: not recover, because the buyer's proper cause of action is for intentional infliction of mental distress.
H: recover, because the dairy failed in its duty of care.

Okay, so I have this question here about tort law, specifically dealing with negligence and product liability. Let me try to break it down. 

The scenario is that a buyer purchased a gallon of nonfat milk in a plastic container from a market. The milk was processed and packaged by a dairy. That evening, the buyer pours himself a glass and finds a dead mouse in it. He spits it out and suffers severe emotional distress but no physical harm. The question is whether he can recover against the dairy for negligent manufacturing.

The options are from A to J, but I see the given options are A to H. So, I need to figure out which of these is the correct answer.

First, I should recall the elements of a negligence claim. Negligence requires a duty of care, breach of that duty, causation (both actual and proximate), and damages. 

In this case, the dairy has a duty to ensure their products are safe for consumption. Processing and packaging milk without any contaminants would fall under that duty. If the milk had a dead mouse, that's a breach of duty because it's a foreign object that shouldn't be there. 

Next, causation: the breach (putting a mouse in the milk) caused the buyer's harm. The buyer found the mouse, which caused emotional distress. So, actual causation seems clear. Proximate cause, though, is about foreseeability. Was it foreseeable that a mouse in the milk would cause emotional distress? I think so. People would expect their food to be free of such contaminants, and finding a mouse would naturally cause distress.

Now, damages. In tort law, damages can be physical harm or, in some cases, purely emotional distress. But for negligence, typically, you need a physical manifestation unless it's a case where the defendant's actions are considered outrageous (which would fall under intentional infliction of emotional distress). 

So, the buyer here didn't suffer physical injury, only emotional distress. The question is whether that's sufficient for a negligence claim against the dairy. 

I remember that in cases of product liability, especially under strict liability, the plaintiff can recover if the product is unreasonably dangerous. But this question is about negligent manufacturing, so strict liability isn't directly the issue here unless option D is about that.

Wait, option D says "recover under strict liability." But the question is about a negligent manufacturing claim. So, if the claim is negligence, does the plaintiff need to show physical harm? 

In some jurisdictions, a plaintiff can recover for emotional distress caused by the consumption of a contaminated product under what's sometimes called the "foreign substance" rule. This is an exception where even without physical injury, the distress is actionable because it's a direct result of the defendant's negligence in producing the product. 

So, under this rule, the buyer might recover even without physical harm. But I'm not entirely sure if this applies universally. 

Looking at the options, option E says "recover because he suffered severe emotional distress." But if the rule requires something more, like physical impact, then this might not be sufficient. Alternatively, option H says "recover because the dairy failed in its duty of care." That seems correct if the elements are met, including damages.

But wait, do courts allow recovery for emotional distress alone in product cases? I think some cases allow it, especially when the contamination could foreseeably cause such distress. For example, in cases where someone finds a dead mouse in their food, courts might recognize the emotional harm without requiring physical injury.

Option A says he can't recover because the negligence only caused mental disturbance. But if the foreign substance rule applies, that's not the case. So A might be incorrect.

Option B is about res ipsa loquitur, which means "the thing speaks for itself." That doctrine applies when the injury is of a kind that would not normally occur without negligence. But the buyer would still need to prove that the dairy was the cause, and that the negligence happened. I'm not sure if that's the main issue here.

Option C suggests the dairy can't be proven as the source of the mouse. But the question states that the milk was processed and packaged by the dairy, so it's more likely than not that the mouse was in the milk when purchased. So C is probably incorrect.

Option D is about strict liability. Strict liability doesn't require negligence but requires that the product be defective and unreasonably dangerous. If the product had a mouse, that's a defect. So under strict liability, the buyer could recover. But the question is about a negligent manufacturing claim. So if the question is about negligence, then D might not be the answer, unless the answer is considering both theories. But the question specifically asks about negligent manufacturing, so the answer should relate to negligence.

Option F says the dairy breached its duty by failing to package properly. That's true, but the question is whether the buyer can recover. So it's more about the elements being met.

Option G suggests the proper cause is intentional infliction of emotional distress. But that requires intent or reckless disregard, which isn't present here. So G is incorrect.

So, going back, the key issue is whether emotional distress alone is enough. If the foreign substance rule applies, the buyer can recover without physical injury. But if the jurisdiction requires physical harm, then he can't. 

In the Restatement (Second) of Torts §402A, which deals with strict liability, it says that a buyer can recover for physical harm but also for emotional distress in some cases. But again, that's strict liability. 

In negligence cases, some courts have allowed recovery for emotional distress when the product's defect leads to the distress, even without physical injury. So, in this scenario, the buyer might recover.

Looking at the options again:

Option E: recover because severe emotional distress.

Option H: recover because breach of duty.

So, if the breach caused the distress, and the law allows that, then the answer would be H. But wait, option E focuses on the emotional distress, while H is about the breach. Since the question is about whether he can recover under negligent manufacturing, the answer would be yes if all elements, including damages, are met.

But wait, in some cases, courts have held that for negligent infliction of emotional distress, the plaintiff usually needs to have a physical impact or manifestation. But when a foreign substance is involved, there's an exception.

So, in this case, the dairy's negligence in manufacturing (failing to package properly) led to the buyer's distress. The question is whether that's sufficient.

If the court applies the foreign substance rule, then yes, he can recover. So, the answer would be H, because the dairy failed in its duty.

Wait, but option E says he can recover because of the distress. So which is correct? The reasoning is that he can recover because the dairy breached its duty, leading to the distress. So the answer would be H.

Alternatively, option D is about strict liability. But again, the question is about negligence, so D might not be the right answer.

Wait, but the question is about negligent manufacturing. So if the dairy was negligent, leading to the mouse being in the milk, then the buyer can recover for the resulting emotional distress. So, the answer would be either E or H.

But in negligence, the key is whether the damages are recoverable. If emotional distress is considered a valid damage, then the answer is yes. So, the correct option would be E or H.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option E: recover because he suffered severe emotional distress.

Option H: recover because the dairy failed in its duty.

So, E is more about the type of damage, while H is about the breach. The correct reasoning is that all elements of negligence are met, including damages (which include emotional distress). So, H would be the correct answer because it's about the breach of duty of care.

Wait, but option F says "breach... failing to properly package". That's also correct, but F is more specific. The question is about the buyer's claim based on negligent manufacturing. So, the breach is in their manufacturing process, leading to the mouse being present. So, F might be correct.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to outline the elements again.

Duty: The dairy had a duty to provide safe products.

Breach: They failed to ensure the milk was free from contaminants, so breach is established.

Causation: The breach (mouse in milk) caused the buyer's distress.

Damages: Severe emotional distress.

In some jurisdictions, this is sufficient for a negligence claim. So, the buyer can recover. So, the correct answer would be that he can recover, but which option reflects that?

Option E says he can recover because of emotional distress, which is correct if that's a valid damage. Option H says he can recover because the dairy failed in its duty, which is correct as all elements are met.

So, perhaps the answer is E or H. Alternatively, let's look at the options again.

Option A: Not recover because only mental disturbance. But if that's not the case, A is wrong.

Option B: Res ipsa loquitur. That's a doctrine that can be used, but the question is about negligence, not whether the doctrine applies. So B might not be the best answer.

Option C: Can't prove dairy was the source. The question says the milk was processed and packaged by the dairy, so it's likely their fault. So C is incorrect.

Option D: Strict liability. That's a different theory. The question is about negligence, but D is another approach. So if the answer is about strict liability, D would be correct, but the question is about negligence.

Option E: Recover because of emotional distress. If that's allowed, E is correct.

Option F: Recover because breach of duty in packaging. That's correct, but perhaps F is a reason why he can recover, but the question is about the outcome, not the reasoning.

Option H: Recover because breach of duty. So H is correct.

Wait, but H is a reason, while E is about the damages. The question asks if he can recover, so the answer would be yes, and the option that says he can recover because the breach occurred, so H would be correct. Alternatively, E is about the damages being sufficient.

But I'm a bit confused because in some cases, without physical injury, emotional distress isn't enough. So, maybe the answer is A, that he can't recover because only mental disturbance. But earlier I thought that the foreign substance rule would allow recovery.

Wait, perhaps I should think about whether the dairy's negligence caused the emotional distress. If the dairy's breach directly caused the distress, then it's recoverable.

In the case of the mouse in the milk, courts have sometimes allowed recovery for emotional distress without physical harm because the contamination is so objectionable. So, the answer would be that he can recover.

Looking at the options, E says he can recover because of the distress, and H says because of the breach. Both seem correct, but the more precise answer is that all elements of negligence are met, including damages, so H is correct.

Wait, but the answer options don't have both. So, perhaps the correct answer is E, because it's about the emotional distress being recoverable.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D, strict liability. Because for strict liability, the plaintiff doesn't need to prove negligence, just that the product was defective and caused the injury. In this case, the milk with a mouse is defective. So, under strict liability, the buyer can recover. But the question is about negligence, so maybe D isn't the answer.

Wait, the question is about a claim based on negligent manufacturing, so the correct theory is negligence. So D (strict liability) isn't the answer here.

So, going back, the elements of negligence are met, so the buyer can recover. The options that say he can recover are B, D, E, F, H.

But which one is correct? 

Option E says he can recover because he suffered severe emotional distress. But if the law requires more than that, then E is wrong.

Alternatively, option H says he can recover because the dairy failed in its duty of care. That seems correct because all elements are met, including causation and damages.

So, I think the correct answer is H.

The question revolves around whether the buyer can recover damages from the dairy under a claim of negligent manufacturing after finding a dead mouse in the milk. To determine this, the elements of negligence—duty, breach, causation, and damages—must be analyzed.

1. **Duty**: The dairy had a duty to ensure its products were safe for consumption, free from contaminants like a mouse.
2. **Breach**: The dairy breached this duty by failing to prevent a mouse from being in the milk, which is a clear failure in manufacturing or packaging.
3. **Causation**: The breach directly caused the buyer's harm, as the mouse in the milk led to his severe emotional distress.
4. **Damages**: The buyer suffered severe emotional distress, which is a recognized form of damages in tort law under certain circumstances.

A key issue is whether emotional distress alone is sufficient to recover damages in a negligence claim. In many jurisdictions, emotional distress is recoverable without physical harm if it results from a highly objectionable or foreseeable event, such as finding a dead mouse in food. This is often referred to as the "foreign substance" rule, which allows recovery for emotional distress caused by contamination in food products.

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A** is incorrect because emotional distress can be a valid basis for recovery in this context.
- **Option B** is incorrect because res ipsa loquitur, while potentially applicable, is not the primary issue here.
- **Option C** is incorrect because the dairy, as the processor and packager, is the likely source of the contamination.
- **Option D** is incorrect because the question specifically asks about negligent manufacturing, not strict liability.
- **Option E** is plausible because it focuses on the buyer's emotional distress, which is recoverable under the foreign substance rule.
- **Option F** is partially correct but overly narrow, as it focuses on packaging without addressing the full scope of negligence.
- **Option G** is incorrect because intentional infliction of emotional distress requires intent or recklessness, which is absent here.
- **Option H** is correct because it addresses the breach of duty, which is central to the negligence claim, and implies that all elements, including damages, are satisfied.

While both **E** and **H** are strong options, **H** is the better answer because it directly ties the recovery to the dairy's breach of duty, encompassing all elements of negligence, including damages for emotional distress.
