Question:

A woman is the fee simple owner of a 1,000-acre tract of land. Half of the tract is swampland totally unfit for cultivation, though it is heavily covered with valuable hardwood timber. The other half is also covered with valuable timber, but it would be land fit for the raising of crops if it were cleared of the timber. The latter section of land is more valuable for cultivation than it is for the growing of timber and has clearings where someone could build a home and live. The woman conveyed the tract to her brother for life. At the time of the conveyance, the swampland had never been used for the production of timber. The brother took possession and cleared 40 acres of the timber on the section that was suitable for cultivation. In addition, the brother cut 60 acres of timber in the swampland, thus becoming the first person to exploit this area. The brother then proceeded to clear some timber on the tract and used it in repairing fences, buildings, equipment, and the like on the property. In an action by the woman to permanently enjoin the brother from cutting any more timber on the swampland section of the tract and to account for profits received in the sale of the timber, the woman will most likely

Options:

A: succeed, because a life tenant may not exploit natural resources where no such prior use had been made.
B: not succeed, because a life tenant has a right to make reasonable use of the land.
C: succeed, because the life tenant has not obtained explicit permission to cut timber.
D: succeed, because a life tenant may not clear timber from swampland.
E: not succeed, because the life tenant is allowed to make necessary repairs on the property.
F: not succeed, because a life tenant is not liable for permissive waste.
G: not succeed, because a life tenant is allowed to exploit natural resources for personal use.
H: not succeed, because a life tenant has the right to clear land for cultivation.
I: succeed, because a life tenant may not make changes that alter the value of the land.
J: succeed, because a life tenant must account for permissive waste to the reversioner or remainderman.

Okay, so I have this property law question here about a life tenant and waste. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let me read the question carefully.

So the situation is a woman owns 1000 acres. Half is swampland, which can't be cultivated but has valuable timber. The other half is also timbered but could be farmed if cleared, and it's more valuable for cultivation. She conveys the tract to her brother for life. At the time, the swampland had never been used for timber production. The brother starts clearing 40 acres on the cultivable half and 60 acres on the swampland. He uses some timber to repair fences and buildings on the property. Now, the woman is suing to stop him from cutting more on the swampland and to account for profits from selling the timber.

I think the issue here is about waste. Life tenants are generally not allowed to commit waste, which would impair the value of the property for the remainderman. There are different types of waste—permissive and voluntary. Permissive waste is allowing the property to deteriorate, like not making necessary repairs. Voluntary waste is actively doing something harmful, like cutting down timber without permission when it's not for the use of the property.

In this case, the brother is cutting timber. On the cultivable land, he's clearing 40 acres. Since that land is more valuable for cultivation, cutting the timber to clear it might be permissible because it's for a beneficial use—cultivation. But the swampland is different. It's never been used for timber before, and it's unfit for cultivation. So cutting 60 acres there might be a problem.

Wait, but life tenants are usually allowed to use the land in a way that's reasonable and doesn't constitute waste. Timber is a natural resource, and the rules around it can be tricky. I remember that a life tenant can use timber for necessary repairs or for use on the premises, but not for speculative purposes. Also, if the land is suitable for a particular use, like agriculture, the life tenant might be allowed to remove timber to make way for that use.

So for the swampland part: since it's not suitable for cultivation, the brother doesn't have a beneficial reason to cut the timber there. Cutting 60 acres and selling the timber would likely be considered waste because it's depleting a natural resource without an justifiable reason related to the property's use. The fact that it's the first time the swampland has been exploited for timber suggests that the woman didn't intend for that resource to be used, and the brother is diminishing the asset.

On the other half, the 40 acres he cleared for cultivation—since that's the more valuable use, that might be acceptable. It's using the land as it's meant to be used, so no waste there.

So the woman's lawsuit is about stopping further cutting on the swampland and making him account for the profits. The brother's actions on the swampland would likely be seen as waste because he's exploiting a resource that wasn't previously used, and without a justifiable reason (like improving the land for its intended use). Therefore, the woman would succeed in her claim.

Looking at the options:

A: Succeed because a life tenant may not exploit natural resources where no prior use had been made. This seems to fit because the swampland wasn't used before, and he's exploiting it without a valid reason.

B: Not succeed because reasonable use is allowed. But exploiting a new resource without justification isn't reasonable.

C: Succeed because no explicit permission. I think explicit permission isn't the standard; it's more about whether it's waste.

D: Succeed because can't clear swampland. Not necessarily; if it were for a good reason, maybe, but here it's not.

E: Not succeed because repairs are allowed. But he used some for repairs, which is okay, but selling the rest might not be.

F: Not succeed because not liable for permissive waste. But this is voluntary waste.

G: Not succeed because personal use is allowed. But the question doesn't say he's using it for personal use beyond repairs; possibly selling it, which is commercial.

H: Not succeed because he can clear for cultivation. That applies to the other half, not the swampland.

I: Succeed because changes alter value. Maybe, but the specific issue is waste.

J: Succeed because must account for permissive waste. Wait, permissive waste is about not acting, like letting the property fall into disrepair. Here, it's voluntary waste—active harm.

So the best answer is A. The woman would succeed because the brother exploited a resource that hadn't been used before, and without a valid reason, causing waste.

The question revolves around the doctrine of waste and the rights of a life tenant. A life tenant is generally prohibited from committing waste, which includes actions that diminish the value of the property for the benefit of the remainderman. There are two types of waste: permissive (failing to maintain the property) and voluntary (actively causing harm, such as cutting timber without justification).

In this case, the brother, as the life tenant, cut timber on two sections of the property: 40 acres on the land suitable for cultivation and 60 acres on the swampland, which had never been previously exploited for timber. The key issue is whether these actions constitute waste.

For the 40 acres on the cultivable land, clearing the timber to make way for cultivation is likely permissible, as it aligns with the land's most valuable use. However, the 60 acres cut on the swampland present a problem. Since the swampland is unfit for cultivation and the timber had never been previously used, the brother’s actions constitute voluntary waste. Exploiting this resource without a justifiable reason (such as improving the property) diminishes the value of the property for the remainderman.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Correct. The brother exploited a natural resource (swampland timber) that had no prior use, which constitutes waste.
- **B**: Incorrect. While reasonable use is allowed, exploiting a new resource without justification is not reasonable.
- **C**: Incorrect. The issue is not about explicit permission but whether the actions constitute waste.
- **D**: Incorrect. The prohibition is not against clearing swampland outright but against doing so without justification.
- **E**: Incorrect. While repairs are permissible, selling timber from the swampland is not justified.
- **F**: Incorrect. This pertains to permissive waste, but the brother’s actions are voluntary waste.
- **G**: Incorrect. Personal use might be allowed, but the brother’s actions appear commercial.
- **H**: Incorrect. Clearing for cultivation applies to the other section, not the swampland.
- **I**: Incorrect. While changes may alter value, the specific issue is waste.
- **J**: Incorrect. This refers to permissive waste, not the voluntary waste at play here.

The best answer is **A**, as the brother’s exploitation of the swampland timber, without prior use or justification, constitutes waste.
