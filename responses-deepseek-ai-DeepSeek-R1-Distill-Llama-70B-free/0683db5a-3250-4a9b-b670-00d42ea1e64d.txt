Okay, so I've got this probability question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me start by reading it carefully.

The question says that the distribution of Y is a binomial distribution with parameters n and p=0.25. We need to find a lower bound for P(|Y/n - 0.25| < 0.05) when n=500. The options are from A to J, each with different probabilities.

Hmm, I remember that for binomial distributions, especially when dealing with probabilities around the mean, we can use approximations like the normal distribution when n is large. Since n is 500 here, which is pretty big, the normal approximation should work well.

So, the first thing I think of is the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). The CLT says that the distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as n increases. So Y/n is the sample mean here, which would be approximately normally distributed.

Let me recall the parameters. The mean of Y is np, which is 500 * 0.25 = 125. The variance of Y is np(1-p), so that's 500 * 0.25 * 0.75 = 93.75. The standard deviation of Y would be the square root of the variance, which is sqrt(93.75) ≈ 9.68.

But wait, since we're dealing with Y/n, which is the sample mean, its variance would be p(1-p)/n. So for Y/n, the variance is (0.25 * 0.75)/500 = 0.1875 / 500 = 0.000375. The standard deviation of Y/n is sqrt(0.000375) ≈ 0.01936.

The question is about P(|Y/n - 0.25| < 0.05). That can be rewritten as P(-0.05 < Y/n - 0.25 < 0.05). Adding 0.25 to all parts, we get P(0.20 < Y/n < 0.30).

To standardize this, I'll subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation. Let me compute the Z-scores for both ends.

For the lower bound (0.20):
Z = (0.20 - 0.25) / 0.01936 ≈ (-0.05) / 0.01936 ≈ -2.583.

For the upper bound (0.30):
Z = (0.30 - 0.25) / 0.01936 ≈ 0.05 / 0.01936 ≈ 2.583.

So we're looking for P(-2.583 < Z < 2.583), where Z is the standard normal variable.

I need to find this probability. I remember that the standard normal distribution table gives the area to the left of a Z value. So P(Z < 2.583) minus P(Z < -2.583) would give me the area between them.

Looking up Z=2.58 in the table, since 2.583 is close to 2.58. The value for Z=2.58 is 0.9951. That's the probability to the left of 2.58. Similarly, the probability to the left of -2.58 is 0.0049 (since it's symmetric around 0).

So P(-2.58 < Z < 2.58) = 0.9951 - 0.0049 = 0.9902. Wait, wait, that can't be right because the total would be 0.9902, which is about 0.99. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check the Z values.

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake in the calculation. Because when I subtract, I should compute P(Z < 2.583) as approximately 0.9955 (since 2.58 is about 0.9951, 2.58 is 0.9951, 2.59 is 0.9953, so 2.583 would be roughly 0.9953 or so). Similarly, P(Z < -2.583) would be about 0.0047.

So the area between would be approximately 0.9953 - 0.0047 = 0.9906. So about 0.9906, which is about 0.99.

Wait, but the options don't have 0.99 as the highest. Looking at the options, option I is 0.99. So would that be the answer? But wait, the question is asking for a lower bound. So does that mean we can't use the normal approximation directly, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait another thought. The problem asks for a lower bound. So perhaps it's using an inequality like Chebyshev's, which provides a lower bound for such probabilities without assuming normality. But Chebyshev is usually for when you don't know the distribution's shape, and gives a very loose bound.

Wait, but when n is large, the normal approximation is better. So why would they ask for a lower bound if we can calculate the exact probability using the normal approximation?

Alternatively, maybe there's another approach. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I'm supposed to use the Law of Large Numbers. The Weak LLN states that as n increases, the sample mean converges in probability to the true mean. But that's more about convergence, not giving a specific bound for finite n.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the De Moivre-Laplace theorem, which is the normal approximation to the binomial distribution. That's what I did earlier, so that's correct.

But the question is about a lower bound. So perhaps using the normal approximation gives an approximate probability, but the question is asking for a lower bound, meaning the actual probability is at least this value.

Wait, but the normal approximation gives an approximate value, but the exact value could be higher or lower. So if I use the normal approximation to estimate the probability, perhaps the true probability is higher, making the approximation a lower bound.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the Central Limit Theorem in a different way. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: using the variance. The Chebyshev inequality states that P(|X - μ| ≥ kσ) ≤ 1/k². But here, we're dealing with |Y/n - p| < ε, which can be written as |Y/n - p| < ε. So to find P(|Y/n - p| < ε), we can use Chebyshev to find a lower bound. Because Chebyshev gives an upper bound on the probability of being outside the interval, so 1 minus that would give a lower bound on the probability inside.

So, Chebyshev's inequality says P(|Y/n - p| ≥ ε) ≤ σ² / (n ε²). Wait, no, let me get the variables right.

Wait, Y is binomial with parameters n and p. So the mean of Y is np, variance is np(1-p). So Y/n has mean p, variance p(1-p)/n.

In Chebyshev's terms, for any random variable with mean μ and variance σ², P(|X - μ| ≥ kσ) ≤ 1/k².

In this case, X is Y/n, which has mean p=0.25, variance σ² = p(1-p)/n = 0.25*0.75/500 ≈ 0.000375, as before.

We want P(|Y/n - p| < ε) where ε = 0.05. So the probability that Y/n is within ε of p.

Chebyshev gives us that P(|X - μ| ≥ kσ) ≤ 1/k². So to write this in terms of ε, we have ε = kσ.

Solving for k: k = ε / σ.

So substituting into Chebyshev:

P(|X - μ| ≥ ε) ≤ (σ / ε)^2 * σ²? Wait, no, let me correct. Wait, Chebyshev's formula is P(|X - μ| ≥ kσ) ≤ 1/k².

So if I set kσ = ε, then k = ε / σ.

So substituting into Chebyshev:

P(|X - μ| ≥ ε) ≤ 1/(k²) = (σ / ε)^2.

So the probability that |X - μ| ≥ ε is ≤ (σ/ε)^2.

Thus, the probability that |X - μ| < ε is ≥ 1 - (σ/ε)^2.

So calculating this:

σ = sqrt(p(1-p)/n) = sqrt(0.25*0.75/500) = sqrt(0.000375) ≈ 0.01936.

ε = 0.05.

So (σ/ε)^2 = (0.01936 / 0.05)^2 ≈ (0.3872)^2 ≈ 0.150.

Thus, 1 - 0.150 = 0.85.

So the lower bound is 0.85, meaning that the probability is at least 0.85.

Looking at the options, option F is 0.85.

But wait, earlier using the normal approximation, I got approximately 0.99, but that was an approximation. The question asks for a lower bound, so using Chebyshev gives a lower bound of 0.85.

But wait, the question is phrased as "give a lower bound for P(...)", so the correct answer using Chebyshev would be 0.85. But why use Chebyshev when we can get a better approximation with the normal distribution?

Ah, perhaps the question is testing the understanding that Chebyshev provides a lower bound, while the normal approximation gives an approximate value which is higher but not necessarily a guaranteed lower bound.

Wait, but when using the normal approximation, we can't be sure it's a lower bound; it's just an approximation. So perhaps the intended method here is Chebyshev, giving a lower bound of 0.85.

So looking at the options, 0.85 is option F.

But wait, wait a second. Let me recheck my Chebyshev calculation.

σ² = p(1-p)/n = 0.25*0.75/500 = 0.000375.

σ = sqrt(0.000375) ≈ 0.01936.

ε = 0.05.

So (σ/ε)^2 = (0.01936/0.05)^2 ≈ (0.3872)^2 ≈ 0.150.

So 1 - 0.150 = 0.85. So yes, the lower bound is 0.85.

But the options include 0.85 as option F. So the answer should be F.

But earlier, when I used the normal approximation, I got a probability of about 0.99, which is higher. So which one is correct?

Wait, the question asks for a lower bound. So Chebyshev gives us a guaranteed lower bound of 0.85 regardless of the distribution's shape. The normal approximation gives a higher value, but that's just an estimate. So the minimal probability we can guarantee is 0.85.

Therefore, the correct answer is F: 0.85.

To solve the problem, we start by recognizing that \( Y \) follows a binomial distribution \( b(n, 0.25) \), and we are tasked with finding a lower bound for \( P(|Y/n - 0.25| < 0.05) \) when \( n = 500 \). 

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
The binomial distribution can be approximated by the normal distribution for large \( n \) due to the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). However, the question explicitly asks for a **lower bound**, which suggests using a method like Chebyshev's inequality to guarantee the result without assuming normality.

### Step 2: Apply Chebyshev's Inequality
Chebyshev's inequality provides a lower bound for the probability that a random variable is within a specified range of its mean. For a random variable \( X \) with mean \( \mu \) and variance \( \sigma^2 \), Chebyshev's inequality states:

\[
P(|X - \mu| \geq k\sigma) \leq \frac{1}{k^2}.
\]

Rearranging, the probability that \( X \) is within \( k\sigma \) of \( \mu \) is:

\[
P(|X - \mu| < k\sigma) \geq 1 - \frac{1}{k^2}.
\]

### Step 3: Define Parameters
Here, \( X = Y/n \), which has:
- Mean \( \mu = p = 0.25 \),
- Variance \( \sigma^2 = \frac{p(1-p)}{n} = \frac{0.25 \cdot 0.75}{500} = 0.000375 \),
- Standard deviation \( \sigma = \sqrt{0.000375} \approx 0.01936 \).

The problem specifies \( \epsilon = 0.05 \), so we set \( k\sigma = \epsilon \), giving \( k = \frac{\epsilon}{\sigma} = \frac{0.05}{0.01936} \approx 2.583 \).

### Step 4: Compute the Lower Bound
Using Chebyshev's inequality:

\[
P(|Y/n - 0.25| < 0.05) \geq 1 - \frac{1}{k^2}.
\]

Substituting \( k \approx 2.583 \):

\[
P(|Y/n - 0.25| < 0.05) \geq 1 - \frac{1}{(2.583)^2} \approx 1 - \frac{1}{6.673} \approx 1 - 0.150 = 0.85.
\]

Thus, the lower bound for the probability is \( 0.85 \).

### Step 5: Compare with Options
The computed lower bound matches option \( F \), which is \( 0.85 \).

### Final Answer
The correct answer is **F: 0.85**.
