Okay, so I have this linear algebra question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me try to break it down. The question is about a linear transformation P on a finite-dimensional real vector space V, and it's given that P squared equals P. So, P^2 = P. I remember that such transformations are called idempotent. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact properties, so let me think.

The question asks which of the statements I, II, III must be true. The options are about whether P is invertible, diagonalizable, or one of the identity or zero transformations.

First, let's recall what each statement means.

Statement I: P is invertible. For a transformation to be invertible, it must be both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto). Alternatively, if the determinant of P is non-zero, it's invertible. But wait, I'm not sure if P^2 = P implies that P is invertible. Maybe I can check that.

If I suppose that P is invertible, then P^2 = P implies that multiplying both sides by P inverse gives P = I, right? Because P inverse times P^2 is P, and P inverse times P is the identity. So if P is invertible, then P must be the identity transformation. But is the identity transformation the only possibility when P^2 = P and P is invertible? Yes, because if P were invertible, then P squared equals P would imply P is identity. But wait, what if P is zero? No, because the zero transformation isn't invertible. So if P is invertible, then it must be the identity. But does P being idempotent (P^2 = P) imply it's invertible? Not necessarily. For example, the zero transformation satisfies P^2 = P (since 0 squared is 0), but it's not invertible.

So statement I says P is invertible, but that's not necessarily true. So I can't say statement I must be true. So any option that says I must be true (like options C, D, E) can be eliminated.

Now, statement II: P is diagonalizable. Diagonalizable means that P can be written in a diagonal matrix form, which requires that it has enough eigenvectors to form a basis. For that, I think the minimal polynomial must split into distinct linear factors. Another approach is to check if P is diagonalizable based on its eigenvalues.

For an idempotent transformation, the eigenvalues are either 0 or 1. Because if you have P(v) = λv, then applying P again would give P(P(v)) = P(λv) = λP(v) = λ^2 v. But P^2 = P, so λ^2 = λ, which implies λ is 0 or 1.

Now, if all eigenvalues are 0 and 1, does that mean P is diagonalizable? Well, I think so. Because the minimal polynomial would be x(x-1), which factors into distinct linear factors. So if the minimal polynomial factors into distinct linear factors, then the transformation is diagonalizable. So P should be diagonalizable. So statement II is true.

Wait, but wait a second. I remember that a matrix is diagonalizable if and only if its minimal polynomial has no repeated roots. So in this case, the minimal polynomial could be x(x-1), which is square-free, so yes, P would be diagonalizable. So statement II must be true.

Now, statement III: P is either the identity transformation or the zero transformation. Hmm, is that necessarily true? Because I can think of other idempotent transformations. For example, consider a projection onto a subspace. Let me take a simple case in R^2: projection onto the x-axis. The matrix would be [[1, 0], [0, 0]]. Applying this twice gives the same matrix, so it's idempotent. But it's neither identity nor zero. So statement III is not necessarily true. Therefore, statement III is false.

Putting it together: statement I is not necessarily true, statement II is true, and statement III is false. So the correct answer should be that only statement II is true. Looking at the options, option B is "II only."

To determine which of the statements about the linear transformation \( P \) must be true, we analyze each statement in the context of \( P^2 = P \).

### Statement I: \( P \) is invertible.
A linear transformation is invertible if it is both injective and surjective. If \( P \) were invertible, then multiplying both sides of \( P^2 = P \) by \( P^{-1} \) would yield \( P = I \), meaning \( P \) would have to be the identity transformation. However, not all idempotent transformations are invertible. For example, the zero transformation satisfies \( P^2 = P \) but is not invertible. Therefore, \( P \) is not necessarily invertible, and **Statement I is false**.

### Statement II: \( P \) is diagonalizable.
A linear transformation is diagonalizable if its minimal polynomial factors into distinct linear terms. For an idempotent transformation, the eigenvalues are restricted to \( 0 \) and \( 1 \). The minimal polynomial of \( P \) is \( x(x-1) \), which is square-free and factors into distinct linear terms. Thus, \( P \) is diagonalizable. **Statement II is true**.

### Statement III: \( P \) is either the identity transformation or the zero transformation.
While \( P^2 = P \) implies that \( P \) is idempotent, it does not restrict \( P \) to being only the identity or the zero transformation. For example, a projection onto a subspace (e.g., the projection onto the x-axis in \( \mathbb{R}^2 \)) satisfies \( P^2 = P \) but is neither the identity nor the zero transformation. Therefore, **Statement III is false**.

### Conclusion:
Only **Statement II** must be true. The correct answer is:

**B: II only**
