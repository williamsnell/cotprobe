Okay, so I've got this question about electric circuits, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about what happens to the current in a power source when more lamps are connected in a series circuit.

Hmm, I remember that in a series circuit, components are connected one after another, so there's only one path for the current to flow. Oh right, and in a series circuit, the current is the same throughout the circuit. So if you have a bunch of lamps in series, the same current flows through each lamp.

Wait, but how does adding more lamps affect the current from the power source? Oh, right, resistance plays a role here. Each lamp has some resistance, and when you add more lamps in series, the total resistance increases. Because in series, resistances add up. So total resistance R_total = R1 + R2 + R3 + ... and so on.

Now, current is related to voltage and resistance by Ohm's Law, I = V/R. So if the voltage from the power source is constant, and the total resistance R increases when adding more lamps, then the current I should decrease, because I is inversely proportional to R. So as R goes up, I goes down.

Let me think about an example. Suppose the power source is 12 volts. If the first lamp has a resistance of, say, 4 ohms, then the current would be 12V / 4Ω = 3A. Now add another lamp of the same resistance in series. Now total R is 8 ohms. Current becomes 12/8 = 1.5A. So the current is halved when two lamps are added. Wait no, actually, each lamp is 4 ohms, so adding two would make R=8Ω. So current goes from 3A to 1.5A, which is half. So each additional lamp increases R, thus decreasing I.

Wait, but what if the power source has an internal resistance? Oh, but the question says "the current in the power source", I think that refers to the total current supplied by it, which is the same as the current in the circuit. Because in series, the current everywhere is the same.

So each time you add a lamp, the total resistance increases, causing the current to decrease. So when more lamps are connected, the current decreases.

Looking back at the options, option E is "decreases". So the answer should be E.

Wait, but what about the power source's capacity? If it's an ideal source with fixed voltage, yes, the current would decrease as more lamps (resistances) are added. But in real life, power sources have internal resistances. But the question doesn't mention that, so I think we can assume it's an ideal source.

So the correct answer should be E: decreases.
</think>

When more lamps are connected to a series circuit, the total resistance increases because resistances in series add up. According to Ohm's Law (I = V/R), if the voltage (V) from the power source remains constant, the current (I) decreases as the total resistance (R) increases. Therefore, as more lamps are added, the current in the power source decreases.

The correct answer is **E: decreases**.

Answer: E
