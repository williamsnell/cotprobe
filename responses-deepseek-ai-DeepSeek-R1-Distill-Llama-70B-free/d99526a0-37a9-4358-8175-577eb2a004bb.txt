Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Aquinas's view on man's ultimate happiness. I remember that Thomas Aquinas was a Scholastic philosopher and theologian, so his ideas are probably tied into both faith and reason.

The question is asking what, according to Aquinas, constitutes man's ultimate happiness. The options are A through J, each offering a different possibility. Let me think about what I know about Aquinas's philosophy.

I recall that Aquinas was influenced by Aristotle, but he also integrated Christian theology into his work. Aristotle believed that eudaimonia, often translated as happiness, comes from living a virtuous life and achieving one's potential. But Aquinas, being a Christian, would have added a theological dimension to this.

In Aquinas's Summa Theologica, he discusses the concept of beatitudo, which is Latin for happiness or blessedness. He argues that the ultimate happiness for humans isn't something attainable in this life but is found in the next life. Specifically, he talks about the vision of God, or the beatific vision, where the soul sees God face to face.

So, according to Aquinas, man's ultimate happiness is contemplating God. That would mean the correct answer is about contemplating God. Looking at the options, F is "contemplating God." 

Let me go through the other options to make sure I'm not missing something. Option B is acts of moral virtues. While Aquinas does value virtues, he sees them as means to an end, not the end itself. The end is the beatific vision. Option C is loving God, which is important, but I think the ultimate happiness is more specific—contemplation. Option I is acquiring knowledge, which is part of it, but again, the ultimate is the vision of God.

So I think F is the right answer.

In Aquinas’s view, man’s ultimate happiness consists in contemplating God, as he believed the highest human achievement is the beatific vision—seeing God face to face in the afterlife. This surpasses earthly virtues, love, or knowledge as the ultimate end.

Answer: F
