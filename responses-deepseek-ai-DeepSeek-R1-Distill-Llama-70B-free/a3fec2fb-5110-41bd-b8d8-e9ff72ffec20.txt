Okay, so I've got this math problem in front of me, and I need to figure out which expression equals 720. The options are A through D, and each is a multiplication of two numbers. Let me take it step by step.

First, I should probably calculate each option to see which one gives me 720. Let me list them out again to make sure I don't mix them up.

Option A: 7 times 20.
Option B: 9 times 90.
Option C: 8 times 80.
Option D: 9 times 80.

Alright, let's start with Option A. 7 multiplied by 20. Hmm, 7 times 20 is 140. That's way too small because 720 is much bigger. So A is out.

Next, Option B is 9 times 90. Let's see, 9 times 90. I can break this down: 90 is 9 times 10, so 9 times 9 is 81, and then times 10 would be 810. Oh wait, that's 810, which is more than 720. So B is too big.

Now, Option C: 8 times 80. Let me calculate that. 8 times 80... Hmm, 8 times 8 is 64, and since 80 is 8 times 10, that would make it 640. Wait, no, wait. Wait a second, no, that's not right. Because 8 times 80 is actually 640. Because 8 times 8 is 64, and since there's a zero in 80, it's 640. Oh, that's less than 720. So C is 640, which isn't enough.

So that leaves me with Option D: 9 times 80. Let me calculate that. 9 times 80. Well, 9 times 8 is 72, and then add a zero because 80 is 8 times 10. So 72 times 10 is 720. Oh, there we go! That's exactly what we're looking for.

Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me go through each option again.

A: 7*20=140. No.
B: 9*90=810. No.
C: 8*80=640. No.
D:9*80=720. Yes.

Yep, D is the correct answer. I think I've got it right.

The correct answer is D.
