Question:

Explain how density dependent controls of population occur.

Options:

A: Density dependent controls occur when the population density decreases.
B: Density dependent controls occur when the population's growth is influenced by unlimited resource availability.
C: Density dependent controls are independent of the population's size and density.
D: Density dependent controls occur when a population is limited by weather changes only.
E: Density dependent controls occur when a population's habitat changes.
F: Density dependent controls are determined by the occurrence of natural disasters, regardless of population density.
G: Density dependent controls occur when regulatory factors like predation, emigration, competition, physiological and behavioral mechanisms oppose the growth of a population as its density increases.
H: Density dependent controls occur solely due to predation.
I: Density dependent controls happen exclusively due to immigration of new individuals into a population.
J: Density dependent controls occur when a population's growth rate increases without limit as its density increases.

Okay, so I've got this question about population biology, specifically about density-dependent controls. Hmm, I remember that populations can be regulated by factors that depend on their density, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me think through this.

Density-dependent controls... Right, these are factors that affect population growth based on how dense the population is. So, as the population gets denser, these factors become more significant. I think examples include things like competition for resources, predation, and diseases spreading more easily when there are more individuals in a small area.

Looking at the options, I need to pick the one that correctly describes how these controls work. Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A says it's when population density decreases. Wait, density-dependent factors don't just act when the population is decreasing; they can influence growth in either direction depending on density. So A might not be correct.

Option B mentions unlimited resources. No, that doesn't sound right. If resources are unlimited, density-dependent factors like competition wouldn't come into play as much. So B is probably wrong.

Option C claims they're independent of population size, which is the opposite of density-dependent. So C is incorrect.

Option D says it's limited by weather changes only. Weather is more of a density-independent factor because it affects populations regardless of their density. So D isn't right.

Option E is about habitat changes. While habitat changes can influence populations, they aren't specifically tied to density-dependent mechanisms. So E might not be the right choice.

Option F talks about natural disasters regardless of density. Again, natural disasters are usually density-independent factors, so F is incorrect.

Option G states that factors like predation, emigration, competition, and physiological mechanisms oppose growth as density increases. That sounds right. As a population becomes more dense, these factors become more impactful, slowing down growth. So G looks like a good candidate.

Option H says it's solely due to predation. No, because there are other factors involved too, like competition and disease. So H is too narrow.

Option I says it's due to immigration. But immigration would affect the population, but it's not the primary mechanism of density-dependent control. Plus, immigration can be influenced by density in some cases, but the option says it's exclusive, which isn't accurate.

Option J claims growth rate increases without limit as density increases. That's the opposite of what happens. High density usually limits growth, so J is incorrect.

Putting it all together, the correct answer should be G because it accurately describes the various density-dependent factors that affect population growth as density increases.

Density-dependent controls occur when regulatory factors such as predation, emigration, competition, and physiological and behavioral mechanisms oppose the growth of a population as its density increases. These factors become more significant as the population becomes denser, unlike density-independent factors, which affect populations regardless of their size. 

The correct answer is:

G

Answer: G
