Okay, so I need to figure out how much the vice president of sales spent on lunch, including the tip. Let me see. The lunch was $44, and she gave a 20% tip. Hmm, tips are usually calculated based on the pre-tip amount, right?

Wait, so the total she spent would be the cost of the lunch plus the tip. The tip is 20% of $44. Let me calculate that. 20% is the same as 0.20 in decimal form. So 44 multiplied by 0.20... Let me do that math. 44 times 0.2. Hmm, 40 times 0.2 is 8, and 4 times 0.2 is 0.8, so together that's 8.8. So the tip is $8.80.

Now, adding that to the original lunch cost. $44 plus $8.80. Let me add those together. 44 plus 8 is 52, and then plus 0.80 would make it 52.80. So the total she spent is $52.80.

Looking at the options, option C is $52.80. So that must be the correct answer. Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 20% of 44 is 8.8, adding to 44 gives 52.8. Yep, that's right.

The total amount spent on lunch, including a 20% tip, is calculated by adding the tip ($8.80) to the original lunch cost ($44), resulting in $52.80.
