Okay, so I've got this problem here about Tom buying a bicycle and then selling it later. I'm a bit rusty on accounting, but let's see if I can figure this out.

So, Tom bought the bike for $80. After four years, he sold it to a second-hand dealer for $15. The question is asking for two things: the annual depreciation using the straight-line method and the annual rate of depreciation.

Alright, straight-line depreciation. I remember that this method spreads the depreciation equally over the life of the asset. So first, I think I need to find the total depreciation over the four years.

The formula I recall is: Depreciation = (Cost - Salvage Value) / Life.

Cost is what he paid initially, which is $80. Salvage value is what he sold it for, $15. Life is the number of years he used it, so 4 years.

Let me plug in the numbers. Depreciation = (80 -15)/4 = 65/4 = 16.25 dollars per year. Wait, so the annual depreciation is $16.25? Hmm, that seems right because each year the bike loses the same amount.

Now, the next part is the annual rate of depreciation. I'm a bit confused here. I think the rate is calculated based on the original cost. So, the rate would be (Annual Depreciation / Original Cost) * 100% to get the percentage.

So, that would be (16.25 / 80) * 100. Let me compute that. 16.25 divided by 80 is 0.203125. Multiply by 100 gives 20.3125%, which is approximately 20.3%. So the rate is about 20.3% per year.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about the rate is: the annual depreciation is a fixed percentage of the original cost each year. So yes, the calculation I did should be correct.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option B says $16.25 per year and 20.3%. That matches my calculations. Option H is $16 and 20%, which is close but not exact. So B seems correct.

Wait, but wait. Another thought: Sometimes, the rate is calculated differently. Like, maybe it's based on the book value each year, but no, straight-line method uses the original cost minus salvage over the life. So the rate is based on the original cost.

So yeah, I think I'm confident that the annual depreciation is $16.25 and the rate is approximately 20.3%. So the correct option is B.

To determine the annual depreciation by the straight-line method and the annual rate of depreciation, we start with the given data:

- **Cost of the bicycle**: $80  
- **Salvage value**: $15  
- **Useful life**: 4 years  

### Step 1: Calculate Annual Depreciation  
The straight-line method formula for annual depreciation is:  
\[
\text{Annual Depreciation} = \frac{\text{Cost} - \text{Salvage Value}}{\text{Useful Life}}
\]  
Substituting the values:  
\[
\text{Annual Depreciation} = \frac{80 - 15}{4} = \frac{65}{4} = 16.25
\]  
Thus, the annual depreciation is **$16.25**.

### Step 2: Calculate Annual Rate of Depreciation  
The annual rate of depreciation is calculated as a percentage of the original cost:  
\[
\text{Annual Rate of Depreciation} = \left(\frac{\text{Annual Depreciation}}{\text{Original Cost}}\right) \times 100
\]  
Substituting the values:  
\[
\text{Annual Rate of Depreciation} = \left(\frac{16.25}{80}\right) \times 100 = 0.203125 \times 100 = 20.3125\%
\]  
This is approximately **20.3%**.

### Step 3: Match with Options  
From the calculations:  
- Annual depreciation = **$16.25**  
- Annual rate of depreciation = **20.3%**  

The correct option is **B: $16.25 per year and 20.3%**.
