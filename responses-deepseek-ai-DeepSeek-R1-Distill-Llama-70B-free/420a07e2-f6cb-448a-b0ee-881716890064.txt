Okay, so I've got this economics question here about comparative and absolute advantage. Hmm, I remember from my studies that absolute advantage is when someone can produce more of a good than another person in the same amount of time. Comparative advantage, on the other hand, is about the opportunity cost—what you give up to produce a good compared to another person.

The question is about Ray and Dorothy. Both can cook and pull weeds. The data given is about how many weeds they can pull per hour of cooking. Wait, actually, it's the other way around: for every hour of cooking, how many weeds they can pull. So, for each hour Ray spends cooking, he can pull 50 weeds. And Dorothy can pull 100 weeds in that same time.

Wait, I think I might have that backwards. Let me read it again. "For every hour of cooking, Ray can pull 50 weeds and Dorothy can pull 100 weeds." So, if they spend an hour cooking, that's their choice, but the weeds pulled is what they could do alternatively. So, maybe it's about what they give up when they choose to cook.

Wait, no, perhaps it's the other way around. Let me think: if Ray is cooking for an hour, he can pull 50 weeds. So, the number of weeds he can pull per hour of cooking. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Maybe it's saying that for each hour they spend cooking, they could have pulled that many weeds instead. So their opportunity cost of cooking is the number of weeds they could have pulled.

So, let's parse this. The opportunity cost of cooking is the weeds they give up. So, for Ray, the opportunity cost of one hour of cooking is 50 weeds. For Dorothy, it's 100 weeds.

Wait, but that seems inverted. If you choose to cook, you can't pull weeds, so the opportunity cost is what you could have done. So, when Ray cooks for an hour, he could have pulled 50 weeds instead. So his opportunity cost of cooking is 50 weeds per hour. Similarly, Dorothy's opportunity cost is 100 weeds per hour.

So, what are their absolute advantages? Let's think. The absolute advantage is who can produce more of a good. So, let's see: if they were to pull weeds, how much can each do per hour? Or perhaps the question is about their cooking versus pulling weeds.

Wait, the question says, for every hour of cooking, Ray can pull 50 weeds. Wait, that's a bit unclear. Maybe it's that in the time they spend cooking, they could have been pulling weeds. So, perhaps it's better to think of their productivity in each task.

Alternatively, maybe I should set up a table or something. Let's say:

- When Ray cooks for one hour, he could have pulled 50 weeds. So, his cooking time is 1 hour per ...? Wait, no, the data is presented as for every hour of cooking, how many weeds they can pull.

Wait, perhaps it's that when Ray spends an hour cooking, he can pull 50 weeds in that same hour. That doesn't make sense because he can't do both at the same time. So, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the number of weeds each can pull in one hour is their productivity in that task. So, if Ray spends an hour pulling weeds, he can pull 50 weeds. Similarly, Dorothy can pull 100 weeds in an hour.

Wait, that makes more sense. So, Ray's weed-pulling rate is 50 per hour, Dorothy's is 100 per hour. So, in terms of absolute advantage in pulling weeds, Dorothy has it because she can pull more weeds than Ray in the same time.

What about cooking? The problem doesn't give their cooking rates directly. It says for every hour of cooking, Ray can pull 50 weeds. Wait, maybe that's their opportunity cost. So, if Ray chooses to cook for an hour, he gives up 50 weeds. Similarly, Dorothy gives up 100 weeds for each hour she cooks.

So, for cooking, the opportunity cost is weeds. So, the opportunity cost of cooking is what you could have done instead (pulling weeds). So, for Ray, the opportunity cost of one hour of cooking is 50 weeds. For Dorothy, it's 100 weeds.

So, let's think about absolute advantage. Absolute advantage in cooking would be who can cook faster or produce more in an hour. But the question doesn't give any data on how much they can cook. It only tells us about their weed-pulling rates when not cooking.

Wait, perhaps the key is to find out who has a lower opportunity cost in each task. Because comparative advantage is determined by lower opportunity cost.

So, for cooking: the opportunity cost is the weeds you could have pulled. So, Ray's opportunity cost for cooking is 50 weeds per hour, Dorothy's is 100 weeds.

So, Ray has a lower opportunity cost in cooking. That means Ray should specialize in cooking because it's relatively cheaper for him. Conversely, Dorothy has a higher opportunity cost in cooking, so she should focus on pulling weeds where she has a lower opportunity cost compared to Ray.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure. Opportunity cost is what you give up. So, if Ray’s opportunity cost of cooking is 50 weeds, that means when he cooks, he gives up 50 weeds. For Dorothy, she gives up 100 weeds when she cooks. So, cooking is more costly for Dorothy. Thus, Ray should do cooking, Dorothy should do pulling weeds.

So, the question is about who has the comparative advantage in which task.

Looking at the options, the options are about who should do what based on absolute or comparative advantage.

The options are:

A: Ray cooks, absolute advantage in pulling weeds. But absolute advantage is about who can do more. So, Ray has an absolute advantage if he can pull more weeds than Dorothy, but in this case, Dorothy can pull more (100 vs 50). So A is incorrect.

B: Ray pulls weeds, comparative advantage. Wait, but Ray's opportunity cost for cooking is lower, so he should cook. So this would be wrong.

C: Ray cooks, comparative advantage in cooking. That makes sense because his opportunity cost is lower. So C is a possible correct answer.

D: Dorothy pulls weeds, comparative advantage. Because Dorothy's opportunity cost for pulling weeds is lower than Ray's? Wait, no. Because for pulling weeds, the opportunity cost is the cooking they give up. Wait, no, let me think again. The opportunity cost of pulling weeds is how much cooking they give up. But the data is presented in terms of weeds per hour of cooking. Hmm, perhaps I should think of it the other way around.

Wait, perhaps I should model the opportunity cost of each task. So, for each person, the opportunity cost of cooking is the weeds they could have pulled. And the opportunity cost of pulling weeds is the cooking they could have done.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give their cooking rates. It only tells us about weeds pulled when cooking. So, perhaps it's better to see that the opportunity cost of cooking is weeds.

So, for Ray: 1 hour of cooking = 50 weeds not pulled.

Dorothy: 1 hour of cooking = 100 weeds not pulled.

So, Ray's opportunity cost of cooking is 50 weeds, Dorothy's is 100 weeds. So, Ray has a lower opportunity cost in cooking. So he should specialize in cooking.

Dorothy, on the other hand, has a higher opportunity cost in cooking. So she should specialize in pulling weeds because her opportunity cost there is lower. Wait, no, because her opportunity cost for pulling weeds would be the cooking she gives up. But since we don't have their cooking rates, perhaps it's better to think about it as the weeds per hour and the implied cooking.

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let's think about the opportunity cost of each activity for each person.

For Ray:

- If he spends an hour cooking, he gives up 50 weeds.

- If he spends an hour pulling weeds, how much cooking does he give up? Since the problem doesn't give the cooking rate, perhaps we can assume that his cooking rate is 1 dish per hour or something. But without that data, it's tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the way to model it is that the opportunity cost of cooking is weeds, and the opportunity cost of pulling weeds is cooking.

So, for Ray, the opportunity cost of 1 hour of cooking is 50 weeds.

The opportunity cost of 1 hour of pulling weeds is 1 hour of cooking, which could have produced some amount of cooking. But since we don't know how much he can cook in that time, perhaps we can only compare their opportunity costs for cooking.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of comparative advantage. For each person, what's the opportunity cost of each task.

Let me try to model it as:

For Ray:

Opportunity cost of cooking (OC_cooking) = 50 weeds.

Opportunity cost of pulling weeds (OC_weeds) = ?

But without knowing how much he can cook in an hour, it's hard. Alternatively, perhaps the way the data is given is that for each hour of cooking, they can pull a certain number of weeds. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Let me consider that their opportunity costs can be represented as the weeds they can pull per hour of cooking. So, when Ray chooses to cook, he can't pull weeds, and he's giving up 50 weeds per hour. Similarly, Dorothy gives up 100 weeds per hour when she cooks.

Thus, for cooking, Ray's opportunity cost is lower (50 < 100), so he has a comparative advantage in cooking. Therefore, Ray should cook, and Dorothy should pull weeds because her opportunity cost of cooking is higher, meaning she's better off pulling weeds where she has a lower opportunity cost.

Wait, but wait—Dorothy's opportunity cost of pulling weeds would be the cooking she gives up. But we don't know how much she can cook in an hour. So, perhaps another approach is to find each person's opportunity cost for each task.

Wait, perhaps the better way is to calculate the opportunity cost for each task.

Let me define for each person:

Ray:

- If he spends 1 hour cooking, he can pull 50 weeds. So, his opportunity cost of cooking is 50 weeds.

- If he spends 1 hour pulling weeds, how much cooking does he give up? But we don't have data on his cooking rate. So perhaps we can't directly compute that.

Similarly for Dorothy:

- 1 hour cooking → 100 weeds.

- 1 hour pulling weeds → how much cooking?

Again, no data. So perhaps the key is to compare their opportunity costs of cooking.

Since Ray's opportunity cost of cooking is 50 weeds, and Dorothy's is 100 weeds, Ray should cook, Dorothy should pull weeds.

Thus, looking at the options, which one says that?

Option C says: Ray cooks, since he has comparative advantage in cooking.

Option D says: Dorothy pulls weeds, since she has comparative advantage in pulling weeds.

Wait, but how do we know Dorothy has a comparative advantage in pulling weeds?

Comparative advantage is determined by lower opportunity cost. So, for pulling weeds, what is each person's opportunity cost?

The opportunity cost of pulling weeds is the amount of cooking they have to give up. But without knowing their cooking rates, perhaps we can infer from their weed-pulling rates.

Wait, perhaps the way to see this is that since Dorothy can pull 100 weeds per hour, which is more than Ray's 50, she has an absolute advantage in pulling weeds. But Ray has a lower opportunity cost in cooking, so he should specialize in cooking, and Dorothy in pulling weeds because her opportunity cost of cooking is higher.

So, Ray should cook, Dorothy should pull weeds.

Looking at the options, option C says Ray cooks because of comparative advantage in cooking, which is correct.

Option D says Dorothy pulls weeds because of comparative advantage, which is also correct because her opportunity cost in cooking is higher, so she should pull weeds where her opportunity cost is lower.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is correct.

Looking at the options:

Option C: Ray cooks, since he has comparative advantage in cooking.

Option D: Dorothy pulls weeds, since she has comparative advantage in pulling weeds.

Wait, but Dorothy has a higher absolute advantage in pulling weeds, but does she have a comparative advantage in pulling weeds compared to Ray?

Comparative advantage is about lower opportunity cost. So, if the opportunity cost of pulling weeds for Dorothy is less than Ray's, then she has a comparative advantage.

But without knowing their opportunity costs for pulling weeds, perhaps we can't directly say. Alternatively, since Ray's opportunity cost for cooking is lower, Dorothy's must be higher, so she should do the other task.

In any case, from the options, the correct choice is that Ray should cook because he has a lower opportunity cost in cooking, and Dorothy should pull weeds.

So, looking at the options, option C and D both seem correct. But let's look carefully.

Option C: Ray cooks because of comparative advantage in cooking. That's correct.

Option D: Dorothy pulls weeds because of comparative advantage in pulling weeds. That's also correct, but does she have a comparative advantage in pulling weeds?

Wait, to determine comparative advantage in pulling weeds, we need to compare the opportunity costs. But without knowing their cooking rates, perhaps we can't directly compute that. Alternatively, perhaps the way to think about it is that the opportunity cost of pulling weeds is the cooking you give up. So, for Ray, pulling weeds costs him 1 hour of cooking, which could have allowed him to not pull 50 weeds. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the better approach is to model their production possibilities and find their opportunity costs.

Let me try to outline their opportunity costs.

Let’s assume that both can either cook or pull weeds.

For Ray:

- If he spends 1 hour cooking, he can pull 50 weeds. So, the opportunity cost of cooking is 50 weeds.

- If he spends 1 hour pulling weeds, how much cooking does he give up? Suppose that in one hour, Ray can cook X dishes. Then, the opportunity cost of pulling weeds would be X dishes. But since the problem doesn’t give X, we can’t find the exact number.

Similarly, for Dorothy, the opportunity cost of cooking is 100 weeds. The opportunity cost of pulling weeds would be Y dishes, which we don't know.

But since the question is about who should do what, we can compare their opportunity costs for cooking.

Ray's opportunity cost of cooking is lower (50 weeds) than Dorothy's (100 weeds). So Ray should specialize in cooking, Dorothy in pulling weeds.

So, the correct division is Ray cooks, Dorothy pulls weeds.

Looking at the options:

Option C: Ray cooks, since he has comparative advantage in cooking. Correct.

Option D: Dorothy pulls weeds, since she has comparative advantage in pulling weeds. But does she have a comparative advantage in pulling weeds? Let's think.

Comparative advantage in pulling weeds would mean that Dorothy's opportunity cost of pulling weeds is lower than Ray's. But without knowing their cooking rates, we can't exactly say. However, since Dorothy's opportunity cost of cooking is higher, she should specialize in the other task, where she has a comparative advantage.

Wait, perhaps another way: the one with the lower opportunity cost in a task should do that task. So Ray has lower OC in cooking, so he does that. Dorothy, having higher OC in cooking, should do the other task, which is pulling weeds.

Thus, the correct answer would be option C and D are correct? But looking at the options, the choices are individual.

Wait, the options are all separate. So the correct answer is that Ray should cook, and Dorothy should pull weeds. So the correct options would be C and D. But the options are mutually exclusive.

Looking at the options:

C: Ray cooks, comparative advantage in cooking. Correct.

D: Dorothy pulls weeds, comparative advantage in pulling weeds. Correct.

But the options are presented as separate choices. So the correct answers would be both C and D. But since the options are A to J, each being a separate choice, the correct answer must be either C or D.

Wait, no, each option is a separate choice. The options are about what each person should do. So the correct answer would be that Ray cooks (C) and Dorothy pulls weeds (D). But the given options don't combine these; each option is a statement about what they should do.

Wait, looking again:

The options are:

A: Ray cooks, since he has absolute advantage in pulling weeds. No, because he has lower weeds pulled.

B: Ray pulls weeds, comparative advantage.

C: Ray cooks, comparative advantage in cooking.

D: Dorothy pulls weeds, comparative advantage in pulling weeds.

So, the correct statements are C and D.

But the question is, which of the options is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is both C and D, but since the options are single choices, perhaps the answer is D.

Wait, no, the options are all separate. So the correct answer is that Ray should cook and Dorothy should pull weeds. So the correct options are C and D. But the options don't provide a combined choice.

Wait, perhaps the answer is C and D are correct, but the options are separate, so perhaps the answer is D because it's about Dorothy's action, but I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, the question is asking which of the options is correct. So let's look at each option.

Option C: Correct because Ray has lower OC in cooking.

Option D: Correct because Dorothy's OC in cooking is higher, so she should pull weeds where her OC is lower.

But which option correctly identifies their roles based on comparative advantage.

So, the correct answer is both C and D are correct, but since the options are separate, perhaps both are correct. But the options are given as separate letters, and you have to choose one.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the initial data. Let me re-examine the question.

The question states: For every hour of cooking, Ray can pull 50 weeds and Dorothy can pull 100 weeds.

Wait, perhaps that's the number of weeds they can pull per hour of cooking. So, if they spend an hour cooking, during that time, they can pull 50 or 100 weeds. But that doesn't make sense because you can't cook and pull weeds at the same time. So, perhaps it's better to interpret it as their opportunity cost.

So, for each hour spent cooking, Ray gives up 50 weeds he could have pulled. Similarly, Dorothy gives up 100 weeds.

Thus, the opportunity cost of cooking for Ray is 50 weeds per hour.

Opportunity cost of cooking for Dorothy is 100 weeds per hour.

So, Ray should do cooking, Dorothy should do pulling weeds.

Thus, the correct options are C and D.

But looking at the options, the only options that make sense are C and D. So, the correct answer would be both C and D are correct, but the options don't allow for multiple choices.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D because Dorothy has a comparative advantage in pulling weeds. Or C.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to structure it.

Each person's comparative advantage is determined by their opportunity costs.

Ray's OC for cooking: 50
