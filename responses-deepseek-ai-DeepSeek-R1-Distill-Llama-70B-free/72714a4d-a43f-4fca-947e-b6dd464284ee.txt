Okay, so I've got this problem here about determining the power needed to drive a pump. Hmm, let's see what the question says. Alright, the pump is moving 600 gallons per hour of water to a height of 25 feet. The pipe has an inside diameter of 2 inches, a surface roughness of 0.0007 feet, and a total length of 625 feet. There are also some valves and fittings equivalent to 300 pipe diameters. Plus, there's an additional pressure loss of 8 feet of water. The pump is 65% efficient, and I need to find the power required. The options are from A to J, each with different horsepower values.

Okay, so I remember that when calculating the power for a pump, it's all about figuring out the total head the pump needs to overcome and then using that to find the power. The formula I think is Power (hp) = (Head (ft) * Flow (gpm)) / (3960 * Efficiency). But wait, I need to make sure about the units because the flow rate is given in gallons per hour, so I might need to convert that to gallons per minute.

Wait, let's break it down step by step. First, calculate the total head. The head has two components: the static head and the friction losses, right? Oh wait, and any minor losses? Hmm. Oh, right, in pipes, the total head loss is the sum of major losses (due to friction) and minor losses (from fittings, valves, etc.), plus any other pressure losses given.

So the static head is straightforward: it's the height the water is lifted, which is 25 feet. So that's H_static = 25 ft.

Then, the friction loss (major loss) can be calculated using the Darcy-Weisbach equation, I think. The formula is h_f = (f * L * v²) / (2gD), where f is the friction factor, L is the pipe length, v is the flow velocity, g is acceleration due to gravity, and D is the pipe diameter.

Wait, but to find f, the friction factor, I need to determine if the flow is laminar, turbulent, etc. The formula for f depends on that. The relative roughness (ε/D) and Reynolds number (Re) come into play. Let me recall: for turbulent flow, which is more common in pipes, the friction factor can be approximated using the Colebrook-White equation or the Moody diagram. But I think for this problem, maybe we can use an approximate method or perhaps it's given as a certain value? Hmm, the surface roughness is given as 0.0007 ft. So, the pipe's inside diameter is 2 inches, which is 2/12 = 0.1667 feet.

So relative roughness ε/D = 0.0007 / 0.1667 ≈ 0.0042. That's a relatively smooth pipe, I think. Reynolds number Re = (v * D) / ν, where ν is kinematic viscosity. I think for water, ν is about 1e-5 ft²/s.

Wait, but to find v, the velocity, I need the flow rate. The flow rate is 600 gal/hr. Let me convert that to cubic feet per second (cfs) because the units in the formula should be consistent.

Wait, 1 gallon is approximately 0.133681 cubic feet. So 600 gal/hr = 600 * 0.133681 / 3600 seconds = since 1 hr = 3600 seconds. Let me compute that:

600 * 0.133681 = 80.2086; divided by 3600 gives 0.02228 ft³/s. So Q ≈ 0.02228 cfs.

Then, the velocity v is Q/A, where A is the cross-sectional area of the pipe. A = π*(D/2)^2. D is 0.1667 ft, so D/2 is 0.08335 ft. A = π*(0.08335)^2 ≈ 0.0218 ft².

So v = Q/A = 0.02228 / 0.0218 ≈ 1.023 ft/s.

Now calculate the Reynolds number Re = (v * D) / ν = (1.023 * 0.1667) / 1e-5. Let me compute numerator: 1.023 * 0.1667 ≈ 0.1705. Then Re ≈ 0.1705 / 1e-5 = 17,050. So Re is around 17,000. Since that's much greater than 4000, the flow is turbulent.

Now, using the Colebrook-White equation to find f. The equation is 1/sqrt(f) = log10( (ε/(3.7D) ) + (1/Re sqrt(f)) * 0.5 ). Hmm, that's a bit tricky because f appears on both sides. Maybe it's easier to use an iterative approach or an approximation.

Alternatively, the Moody diagram for f with Re around 17,000 and relative roughness of 0.0042. Let me think, for ε/D ~ 0.004 and Re ~ 1e4, the friction factor is around 0.02 or 0.022 perhaps? Let me think. I remember that for turbulent flow, in the fully rough zone, f depends only on ε/D. So let's see, for ε/D = 0.0042, which is in the transition zone maybe. Let's see, for ε/D of 0.0001 to 0.01, the Moody diagram shows that at Re=1e4, f is around 0.03, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I can use the approximation formula for turbulent flow.

Alternatively, using the equation for friction factor in the turbulent smooth region. Wait, but with ε/D=0.0042, perhaps it's in the transition or rough region. Let me try using the Colebrook equation.

Let me set up the equation:

1/sqrt(f) = log10( (ε/(3.7 D)) + (1/(Re) ) * (1/sqrt(f)) * 0.5 )

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the explicit formula for f. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the Haaland equation, which is an approximation of the Colebrook-White equation. The Haaland equation is:

1/sqrt(f) = log10( ( (ε/D)/3.7 ) + (6.8/Re) )^(-1) )

Wait, no, the Haaland equation is 1/sqrt(f) = log( ( (ε/(3.7 D) ) + (1.35/(Re) )^(3/2) )^(1/2) )? Hmm, maybe I should look it up, but I can't right now. Alternatively, perhaps using the Swamee-Jain equation, which is another explicit approximation for f.

Swamee-Jain formula is f = (1/4) * log( (ε/(3.7 D)) + (1.95 / Re^(0.9)) )^(-2). Let's try that.

So plugging in the numbers:

ε/D = 0.0007 / 0.1667 ≈ 0.0042.

Re is 17,050.

So,

f = 0.25 * [ log( (0.0042) + (1.95 / (17050)^0.9) ) ]^(-2)

Let me compute 17050^0.9. Let me compute ln(17050) first. Approximately ln(17050) ≈ around 9.75, since e^9 is about 8103, e^10 is 22026. So 17050 is between e^9.75 and e^9.8.

But perhaps it's easier to compute 17050^0.9:

17050^0.9 = e^{0.9 * ln(17050)}.

Compute ln(17050): Let me approximate. 17050 is 1.7e4. So ln(1.7e4) = ln(1.7) + ln(1e4) = 0.5306 + 9.2103 ≈ 9.7409.

So 0.9 * 9.7409 ≈ 8.7668. Then e^8.7668. e^8 is 2980, e^0.7668 is about 2.153 (since ln(2)≈0.693, 0.7668-0.693=0.0738, so e^0.0738≈1.0765, so 2*1.0765≈2.153). So e^8.7668 ≈ 2980 * 2.153 ≈ 6420.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 17050^0.9 = (1.7e4)^0.9 = 1.7^0.9 * 1e4^0.9. 1e4^0.9 is (1e4)^(9/10) = (1e4)^(0.9)= 1e3.6 ≈ 3981. So 1.7^0.9 is around 1.7^0.9. Let me compute 1.7^0.9: natural log of 1.7 is 0.5306, multiplied by 0.9 gives 0.4775. So e^0.4775 ≈ 1.612. So 1.612 * 3981 ≈ 6420. So 1.95 / 6420 ≈ 0.0003036.

So the term inside the log is 0.0042 + 0.0003036 ≈ 0.0045036.

So log10(0.0045036) = log10(4.5036e-3) ≈ -2.346. So the log of that is about -2.346. So f = 0.25 * [ (-2.346) ]^(-2) → Wait, no, the formula is [log(...)]^(-2), but wait, the Swamee-Jain equation gives f = (1/4) * [ log( (ε/(3.7 D)) + (1.95/Re^0.9) ) ]^(-2). Wait, no, perhaps I messed up the order. Let me make sure.

Wait, the Swamee-Jain formula is f = (1/4) * [ log( (ε/(3.7 D)) + (1.95 / Re^(0.9)) ) ]^(-2) ?

Wait no, the correct formula is f = (1/4) * [ log( (ε/(3.7 D)) + (1.95/(Re))^(0.9) ) ]^(-2). Wait no, that's not right. Let me get the exact formula correctly.

Upon checking, the Swamee-Jain equation is:

f = (1/4) * [ log( ( (ε/D) / 3.7 ) + ( 1.95 / (Re) )^0.9 ) ]^(-2 )

Wait, perhaps I should compute it step by step.

Compute term1 = (ε/D) / 3.7 = 0.0042 / 3.7 ≈ 0.001135.

Compute term2 = (1.95 / Re )^0.9. Re is 17050.

So 1.95 / 17050 ≈ 0.0001143. Then (0.0001143)^0.9. Let me compute that. Let's take natural logs: ln(0.0001143) ≈ -9.143. Multiply by 0.9: -8.229. Exponentiate: e^-8.229 ≈ 0.0002908.

So term2 ≈ 0.0002908.

Now sum term1 + term2: 0.001135 + 0.0002908 ≈ 0.0014258.

Take log base 10 of that: log10(0.0014258) ≈ -2.847.

So f = (1/4) * [ (-2.847) ]^(-2). Wait, no, the log is -2.847, so when you take [log(...)]^(-2), it's [ (-2.847) ]^(-2) → which is (1/ ( (-2.847)^2 )) ) → 1/(8.11) ≈ 0.1234. Then multiply by 1/4: f ≈ 0.1234 * 0.25 = 0.03085.

So f ≈ 0.03085. That's approximately 0.031.

So now, with f known, I can compute the friction loss h_f.

h_f = (f * L * v²) / (2gD)

But wait, let me double-check the formula. Darcy's equation is h_f = (f L v^2) / (2 g D).

Hmm, yes. So let's plug in the numbers.

f = 0.03085

L = 625 ft.

v = 1.023 ft/s.

g = 32.2 ft/s².

D = 0.1667 ft.

So compute numerator: 0.03085 * 625 * (1.023)^2.

First, (1.023)^2 ≈ 1.047.

So 0.03085 * 625 = 19.28125.

Multiply by 1.047: 19.28125 * 1.047 ≈ 20.20.

Denominator: 2 * 32.2 * 0.1667 ≈ 2 *32.2 = 64.4; 64.4 * 0.1667 ≈ 10.733.

So h_f = 20.20 / 10.733 ≈ 1.88 feet.

Wait, that seems a bit low, but okay, let's proceed.

Now, the minor losses. The problem says that the valves and fittings are equivalent to 300 pipe diameters. So the equivalent length for these is 300 * D.

D is 0.1667 ft, so 300 * 0.1667 ≈ 50 ft.

Then, the minor loss h_m is (K * v^2)/(2g), but often for equivalent length, it's (f * L_eq * v^2)/(2g D). Since K for each fitting can be expressed as (Le/D)*f, so the total K would be (Le/D) * f.

Wait, but since we've already calculated the major loss, the minor losses can be calculated similarly. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the equivalent length and use the same f.

Alternatively, maybe the minor losses can be added as h_m = (f * L_eq * v^2)/(2g D), where L_eq is 300 * D.

Wait, but L_eq is 300*D, so L_eq = 300 * 0.1667 ≈ 50 ft.

So h_m = (f * L_eq * v²) / (2g D) = same as h_f with L = L_eq.

So h_m = (0.03085 * 50 * (1.023)^2) / (2 *32.2 *0.1667)

Compute numerator: 0.03085 * 50 = 1.5425, multiplied by 1.047 ≈ 1.615.

Denominator same as before: ~10.733.

So h_m ≈ 1.615 / 10.733 ≈ 0.15 ft.

Wait, but wait, adding that, the total head loss would be h_f + h_m = 1.88 + 0.15 = 2.03 ft.

But wait, I think I might have made a mistake here. Because the total pipe length is 625 ft, and the equivalent length is 50 ft, so the total length for friction is 625 +50 = 675 ft. Oh wait, that's another approach: to add the equivalent length to the pipe length before calculating h_f.

Hmm, maybe that's the correct approach. Because when you have equivalent length from fittings, you can add it to the pipe length and compute the total friction loss accordingly.

So the total length L_total = 625 + 50 = 675 ft.

So then h_f = (f * L_total * v²) / (2g D).

So let me recalculate h_f with L_total = 675 ft.

h_f = (0.03085 * 675 * (1.023)^2) / (2 *32.2 *0.1667 )

Compute numerator: 0.03085 * 675 ≈ 20.79675. Multiply by 1.047 (v squared) → 20.79675 *1.047 ≈ 21.77.

Denominator: 2 *32.2 *0.1667 ≈ 10.73.

So h_f ≈21.77 /10.73 ≈ 2.028 ft.

So that's the total friction loss, including both pipe and fittings.

Wait, but in this approach, I didn't compute h_f and h_m separately because I included the equivalent length in the total length. That makes sense, so the total h_f is about 2.028 ft.

Wait, but maybe I should check if the f remains the same when the pipe length changes. But since f depends on Reynolds number and relative roughness, which are the same, f remains 0.03085.

Now, besides the friction loss, there's an additional pressure loss of 8 ft. of water. I think that's given as an extra, so we just add that to the total head.

So total head H_total = H_static + h_f + additional loss.

H_static =25 ft.

h_f =2.028 ft.

Additional loss =8 ft.

So H_total =25 + 2.028 +8 =35.028 ft.

Wait, but wait, is the additional loss considered as a head loss? I think so. So yes, adding all together.

Now, to find the power required, we can use the formula:

Power (hp) = (H_total (ft) * Q (gpm)) / (3960 * efficiency)

Wait, but I need to make sure about the units. So Q is in gpm.

Earlier, we had Q =600 gal/hr, which is 600/60 =10 gpm.

So Q =10 gpm.

H_total =35.028 ft.

Efficiency =65% =0.65.

So plug in the numbers:

Power = (35.028 *10) / (3960 *0.65 )

Compute numerator:35.028 *10 =350.28.

Denominator:3960 *0.65 ≈2574.

So Power =350.28 /2574 ≈0.136 hp.

Looking at the options, let's see: option J is 0.15, option H is 0.14
