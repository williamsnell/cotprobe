Question:

In a jurisdiction using the grantor grantee indices, the following events have occurred in the order listed below:(1) In 1993, a borrower mortgaged a ranch to a mortgage company to secure a note for $25,000, due on December 31, 1993, with 9V2 percent interest per annum. (2) In 1996, the mortgage company recorded the mortgage on the ranch. (3) In 2007, in a signed writing, which the borrower delivered to his daughter, the borrower promised to convey the ranch to the daughter by a quitclaim deed and pay the mortgage debt when it came due. (4) In 2008, the borrower delivered to the daughter a quitclaim deed that made no reference to the mortgage. If the borrower thereafter defaulted on the mortgage and the mortgage company brought an in personam action against the daughter to recover the amount due on the mortgage debt, the mortgagee will probably

Options:

A: not succeed, because the daughter was not a party to the original mortgage contract.
B: succeed, because the mortgage company has the right to seek payment from any party associated with the property.
C: succeed, because there was an implied delegation of duties to the daughter.
D: succeed, because the mortgage company is a third-party beneficiary of the agreement between the borrower and the daughter.
E: not succeed, because the daughter did not promise to pay the mortgage debt.
F: succeed, because the daughter took ownership of the property with the quitclaim deed.
G: not succeed, because the mortgage company did not record the mortgage until 1996.
H: not succeed, because the daughter was only promised the property, not the debt.
I: succeed, because the borrower defaulted on the mortgage.
J: not succeed, because the law does not permit the mortgagor to delegate duties under this type of a property transfer.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about mortgages and property law. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think through it carefully.

The question is about a jurisdiction that uses grantor-grantee indices. There are a series of events from 1993 to 2008, and then a legal action by the mortgage company against the daughter. I need to figure out if the mortgage company can succeed in their in personam action against her.

Let me first list out the events in order:

1. In 1993, a borrower mortgages a ranch to a mortgage company for $25,000, due Dec 31, 1993, with 9.5% interest annually. So the mortgage is created here, but it's not recorded yet.

2. The mortgage company records the mortgage in 1996. So, three years after the mortgage was made, they record it.

3. In 2007, the borrower (I'll assume the borrower is the same person as the mortgagor) signs a writing delivered to his daughter. The writing promises to convey the ranch via quitclaim deed and pay the mortgage debt when it comes due. So, the borrower is making a promise to his daughter to give her the ranch and pay off the mortgage.

4. In 2008, the borrower delivers a quitclaim deed to the daughter. The deed doesn't mention the mortgage. So, the daughter now owns the ranch, but the mortgage is still on it.

Now, the borrower defaults on the mortgage, and the mortgage company sues the daughter in personam (which means they're suing her personally for the debt).

The question is whether the mortgage company can succeed. The options are A to J, each giving a different reason.

I think I need to consider a few key points here. First, the concept of whether the daughter is personally liable for the mortgage debt. Typically, when you take property subject to a mortgage, you don't become personally liable for the debt unless you explicitly assume it.

So, when the borrower gave the quitclaim deed to the daughter, did she assume the mortgage? The deed didn't mention the mortgage, and the promise to pay was in a separate writing. So the daughter might have taken the property subject to the mortgage but didn't assume the debt.

Wait, but in the 2007 agreement, the borrower promised to convey the ranch and pay the mortgage debt. But when he delivered the deed in 2008, it didn't mention the mortgage. So, the daughter might have taken the property with the mortgage still attached, but without assuming the debt.

I remember that when a mortgagor (borrower) transfers property, the transferee (daughter) can either take it subject to the mortgage or assume the mortgage. If the mortgage is assumed, the transferee becomes personally liable. But if it's taken subject to the mortgage, the transferee isn't personally liable; the mortgage just remains on the title.

In this case, the quitclaim deed didn't mention the mortgage. So, by default, the daughter takes the property subject to the mortgage, but she doesn't assume the debt. Therefore, she isn't personally liable.

But wait, the borrower had a separate agreement in 2007 where he promised to pay the mortgage debt. Does that affect the daughter's liability? Probably not, because the mortgage company wasn't a party to that agreement. The daughter didn't sign any agreement with the mortgage company to take on the debt.

Additionally, the mortgage company's right to collect from the mortgagor is based on the original mortgage contract. The mortgagor (borrower) is personally liable. The daughter, unless she assumed the debt, isn't liable.

So, the mortgage company is suing the daughter in personam. That would require her to be personally liable, which she isn't unless she assumed the debt. Since the deed didn't mention it, and the agreement was just between her and her father, she didn't assume it.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the mortgage company won't succeed because the daughter wasn't a party to the original mortgage contract. That makes sense because she didn't assume the debt.

Option B says the company can seek payment from any party associated with the property. But that's not correct because liability isn't automatically transferred without assumption.

Option C suggests an implied delegation of duties, but delegation of duties doesn't necessarily make the daughter liable. The original debtor (borrower) remains liable.

Option D says the mortgage company is a third-party beneficiary of the 2007 agreement. But the agreement was between the borrower and daughter. The mortgage company wasn't a party, so I don't think they can be a third-party beneficiary unless it was specifically intended, which I don't see here.

Option E states the daughter didn't promise to pay the mortgage debt. But in the 2007 writing, the borrower promised to pay it, not the daughter. So the daughter didn't make any promise herself.

Option F says the daughter took ownership, so she's liable. But taking ownership without assuming the debt doesn't make her liable.

Option G is about the mortgage being recorded late. But recording affects priority, not liability. Since the mortgage was recorded in 1996, and the events after that, I don't think recording affects the daughter's liability here.

Option H says the daughter was only promised the property, not the debt. That aligns with what I thought earlier. The borrower's promise was to pay the debt, not the daughter's.

Option I says the company can sue because the borrower defaulted. But the issue is whether the daughter is liable, not the borrower.

Option J talks about delegation of duties not being allowed. I'm not sure about that. It's more about assumption than delegation.

So, putting it all together, the mortgage company is trying to hold the daughter personally liable. Since she didn't assume the mortgage, either through the deed or a separate agreement, she isn't liable. The correct reason would be that she wasn't a party to the original contract (Option A), or that she didn't promise to pay (Option E), or that she was only promised the property (Option H).

Wait, Option E says the daughter didn't promise to pay. But the borrower promised to pay. So the daughter didn't make any promise. So the mortgage company can't go after her based on her own promise because she didn't make one.

Alternatively, Option A says she wasn't a party to the original mortgage contract, which is true. The mortgage was between the borrower and the mortgage company. The daughter wasn't part of that.

Hmm. So which is the better option? The mortgage company is suing the daughter in personam, trying to hold her liable. If she didn't assume the debt, she's not liable. So the reason would be either A or E or H.

Wait, in the 2007 writing, the borrower promised to pay the mortgage debt. So the daughter isn't making any promise. The borrower is making a promise to her to pay it. So the mortgage company isn't a party to that. Therefore, the daughter didn't take on the debt.

Therefore, the mortgage company can't hold her liable because she didn't assume the mortgage. So the correct answer would be either A or E or H.

Looking back at the options, Option E says the daughter didn't promise to pay, which is accurate. But the mortgage company's claim is based on the mortgage, not on the 2007 agreement. So the mortgage company's rights are based on the original mortgage contract, which the daughter isn't a party to.

So Option A would be correct: the mortgage company can't succeed because the daughter wasn't a party to the original mortgage contract.

Wait, but let me think again. When the daughter took the property, she might have taken it subject to the mortgage. But unless she assumed the mortgage, she isn't personally liable. The mortgage company's recourse would be against the property, not her personally.

So in an in personam action against her, they can't succeed because she didn't assume the debt. Therefore, the reason is either A or E.

But Option E says she didn't promise to pay. She didn't, but the borrower promised her he would pay. So the mortgage company's claim isn't based on her promise, so that's a different issue.

Alternatively, since she didn't assume the mortgage, she isn't personally liable, regardless of the borrower's promise.

So the correct answer is either A or E or H.

Wait, Option H says the daughter was only promised the property, not the debt. That's also correct because she was given the property, but the debt remains with the borrower.

So, perhaps Option E is more precise. Because the mortgage company is suing her, claiming she's liable. But she didn't promise to pay the debt.

Wait, but the mortgage company isn't suing based on the 2007 agreement; they're suing based on the mortgage. But the daughter isn't a party to the mortgage.

So the correct reason is A: the daughter wasn't a party to the original mortgage contract.

Alternatively, the company's only remedy is against the borrower, who is the mortgagor, and perhaps against the property in rem, but not against the daughter in personam.

So, I think Option A is correct: not succeed because she wasn't a party to the original mortgage.

But wait, let me think about Option E again. It says she didn't promise to pay the mortgage debt. That's true, but the mortgage company's claim isn't based on her promise, but on the mortgage. But since she didn't assume the mortgage, she's not liable.

Hmm.

Wait, in the 2007 agreement, the borrower gave the daughter a writing where he promised to convey the ranch and pay the mortgage debt when due. So the daughter might have a claim against the borrower if he fails to pay, but the mortgage company isn't a party to that agreement. So the mortgage company can't enforce that promise against the daughter.

So, in the in personam action, the mortgage company is trying to hold the daughter liable for the mortgage debt. But since she didn't assume it, she's not liable. So the reason is that she wasn't a party to the original mortgage (A) or she didn't promise to pay (E).

I think the more accurate reason is A because the mortgage contract is between the borrower and the mortgage company. The daughter wasn't part of that, so she can't be held liable unless she assumed the debt, which she didn't.

So, the answer should be A.

The question revolves around whether a mortgage company can hold the daughter personally liable for the mortgage debt after the borrower defaulted. The key issue is whether the daughter assumed the mortgage debt when she took ownership of the property through a quitclaim deed. 

1. **Event Analysis**:
   - In 1993, the borrower mortgaged the ranch to the mortgage company, creating a mortgage contract between them.
   - The mortgage was recorded in 1996, which affects priority but not liability.
   - In 2007, the borrower promised the daughter in writing to convey the ranch and pay the mortgage debt when due. However, the quitclaim deed delivered in 2008 did not mention the mortgage, indicating the daughter took the property subject to the mortgage but did not assume the debt.
   - The borrower defaulted, and the mortgage company sued the daughter in personam.

2. **Key Legal Principles**:
   - A transferee of property (the daughter) can take the property either "subject to the mortgage" or "assume the mortgage." If the mortgage is assumed, the transferee becomes personally liable for the debt. If taken subject to the mortgage, the transferee is not personally liable, and the mortgage remains on the title.
   - Personal liability for the mortgage debt requires explicit assumption, which did not occur here since the quitclaim deed made no reference to the mortgage.

3. **Option Analysis**:
   - **Option A**: Correct. The daughter was not a party to the original mortgage contract, and she did not assume the debt, so she cannot be held personally liable.
   - **Option B**: Incorrect. The mortgage company cannot seek payment from the daughter simply because she is associated with the property; liability requires assumption of the debt.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. There is no implied delegation of duties; the daughter did not assume the mortgage.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. The mortgage company is not a third-party beneficiary of the 2007 agreement between the borrower and the daughter.
   - **Option E**: Correct. The daughter did not promise to pay the mortgage debt, but this is secondary to the fact that she was not a party to the original mortgage contract.
   - **Option F**: Incorrect. Taking ownership of the property does not automatically make the daughter liable for the mortgage debt unless she assumed it.
   - **Option G**: Incorrect. The late recording of the mortgage affects priority but not the daughter's liability.
   - **Option H**: Correct. The daughter was only promised the property, not the debt, and she did not assume the mortgage.
   - **Option I**: Incorrect. The borrower’s default does not extend liability to the daughter unless she assumed the debt.
   - **Option J**: Incorrect. The issue is not about delegation but whether the daughter assumed the mortgage, which she did not.

4. **Conclusion**:
   The most accurate reason is that the daughter was not a party to the original mortgage contract and did not assume the debt. Therefore, the mortgage company cannot hold her personally liable.
