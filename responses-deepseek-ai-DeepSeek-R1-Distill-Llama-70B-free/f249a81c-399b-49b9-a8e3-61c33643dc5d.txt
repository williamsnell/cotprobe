Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. It says that at a college, approximately 2 out of 5 seniors go on to attend graduate school. There are 750 seniors, and I need to find out how many are expected to attend graduate school from the options given.

Hmm, so 2 out of 5 is the ratio. That means for every 5 seniors, 2 go to grad school. So I guess I need to find what's 2/5 of 750.

Right, so mathematically, I think I should multiply 750 by 2/5. Let me write that down. 750 times 2 divided by 5. Wait, or maybe I can simplify it first. 750 divided by 5 is 150, because 5 times 150 is 750. Then, 150 times 2 is 300. So 300 seniors would be expected to attend grad school.

Let me check the options. Option J is 300 seniors. So the answer should be J.

Wait, but maybe I should double-check my calculation to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's do it another way. 2 divided by 5 is 0.4. So 750 multiplied by 0.4 equals 300. Yep, that's the same answer. So I'm confident that J is correct.

The problem requires calculating 2/5 of 750 seniors. 

2/5 of 750 is (2/5) * 750 = 300.

So the expected number of seniors attending graduate school is 300.
