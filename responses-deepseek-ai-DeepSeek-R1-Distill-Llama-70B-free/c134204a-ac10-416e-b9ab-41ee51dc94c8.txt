Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's read the question carefully.

The problem is about a gold sheet being exposed to thermal neutrons. I need to find out how many radioactive gold-198 nuclei are produced per second. The given data includes the thickness of the gold sheet, its area, density, neutron flux, capture cross-section, and the atomic weight of gold. Hmm, okay.

First, I'll list out the given values:

- Thickness of gold sheet: 0.3 mm. Oh wait, that's 0.3 millimeters. I think I should convert that to centimeters because some other units are in cm. So 0.3 mm is 0.03 cm.

- Area: 5 cm². That's straightforward.

- Density of gold: 19.3 g/cm³.

- Neutron flux: 1e7 neutrons per cm² per second. So 10^7 n/(cm²·s).

- Capture cross-section of ^197Au: 99 barns. Wait, barn is a unit of area. I remember that 1 barn is 1e-24 cm². So 99 barns would be 99e-24 cm².

- Atomic weight of gold is 197.2. So the molar mass is 197.2 g/mol.

The question is asking for the number of ^198Au nuclei produced per second. I think this involves neutron capture by ^197Au, turning it into ^198Au.

So the steps I need to take are probably:

1. Calculate the mass of the gold sheet.
2. Find out how many moles of gold are present.
3. Determine the number of ^197Au nuclei in the sheet.
4. Calculate the neutron capture rate, which depends on the flux, cross-section, and number of target nuclei.

Let's tackle each step.

Step 1: Mass of the gold sheet.

The volume of the sheet can be found by area multiplied by thickness. Volume = area * thickness.

Area is 5 cm², thickness is 0.3 mm = 0.03 cm. So volume is 5 * 0.03 = 0.15 cm³.

Density is mass/volume, so mass = density * volume = 19.3 g/cm³ * 0.15 cm³ = 2.895 grams.

Wait, let me double-check that: 19.3 * 0.15 is 2.895 grams. Yes.

Step 2: Moles of gold.

Molar mass is 197.2 g/mol. Moles = mass / molar mass = 2.895 g / 197.2 g/mol ≈ 0.01469 moles.

Let me compute that: 2.895 ÷ 197.2. Let me see, 197.2 is about 200. 2.895 / 200 is roughly 0.014475. But since 197.2 is a bit less than 200, the actual value is a bit higher. Let me compute it properly:

197.2 * 0.01469 = ?

Wait, perhaps I should just compute 2.895 / 197.2.

Let me do it step by step.

197.2 goes into 2895 (since 2.895 is 2895 x 1e-3) how many times?

197.2 * 14 = 2756.8 → 197.2 *14= 2756.8.

2895 - 2756.8 = 138.2.

Now, 197.2 * 0.7 is about 138. So approximately 14.7 times.

So 14.7 * 1e-3 → 0.0147 moles. So approximately 0.0147 moles. Let's say 0.01469 for more precision.

Step 3: Number of ^197Au nuclei.

Each mole has Avogadro's number of atoms, which is approximately 6.022e23 atoms/mol.

So number of atoms = moles * Avogadro = 0.01469 mol * 6.022e23 atoms/mol ≈ let's compute that.

0.01469 * 6.022e23 = ?

Let me compute 0.01469 * 6.022 = approx 0.0883.

So 0.0883e23 → 8.83e21 atoms.

Wait, wait, more accurately:

0.01469 * 6.022e23 = (0.01 *6.022e23) + (0.00469 *6.022e23)

0.01 *6.022e23 = 6.022e21

0.00469 *6.022e23 = 0.00469 *6.022 = let's compute that.

0.004 *6.022 = 0.024088

0.00069 *6.022 ≈ 0.004158

Total ≈ 0.024088 + 0.004158 = 0.028246

So 0.028246e23 → 2.8246e21.

So total is 6.022e21 + 2.8246e21 = 8.8466e21. So approximately 8.85e21 nuclei.

Wait, but wait, gold is mono-isotopic? Or does it have multiple isotopes? The problem says to neglect any other neutron reactions with gold. So I think we can assume that all the gold is ^197Au, which is the only isotope considered here.

So all the atoms are ^197Au, which will capture neutrons to become ^198Au.

Step 4: Neutron capture rate.

The formula for the number of captures per second is:

N_captures/s = Flux (n/cm²/s) * Cross-section (cm²) * Number of target nuclei.

Wait, no, the formula is:

The reaction rate R is given by R = Φ * N * σ, where:

- Φ is the neutron flux (neutrons per cm² per second),

- N is the number of target nuclei,

- σ is the cross-section in cm².

So R = Φ * N * σ.

So we have Φ = 1e7 n/(cm² s),

σ = 99 barns = 99e-24 cm²,

N = 8.85e21 nuclei.

So R = (1e7) * (8.85e21) * (99e-24).

Let me compute that.

First, multiply 1e7 * 8.85e21 = 8.85e28.

Then multiply by 99e-24: 8.85e28 * 99e-24 = ?

Compute 8.85 * 99 first.

8.85 * 100 = 885. So 8.85*99 = 885 - 8.85 = 876.15.

Then the exponents: 1e28 * 1e-24 = 1e4.

So 876.15e4 = 8.7615e6 approximately.

Wait, more precisely:

8.85e28 * 99e-24 = (8.85 * 99) * 1e(28-24) )= 876.15 * 1e4 → 8761500.

Which is 8.7615e6.

So approximately 8.76e6 ^198Au nuclei produced per second.

Looking at the options:

Option E is 8.02e6, which is close but not exact. Let me check my calculations again to see if I made any errors.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the number of nuclei. Let me recompute N.

Mass of gold: 5 cm² area, 0.3mm thick. So 5 * 0.03 cm = 0.15 cm³.

Density is 19.3 g/cm³. So mass is 19.3 * 0.15 = 2.895 grams.

Molar mass is 197.2 g/mol, so moles = 2.895 / 197.2 = let's compute it exactly.

197.2 * x = 2.895 → x = 2.895 / 197.2.

Let me compute 2.895 ÷ 197.2.

Hmm, 197.2 is approximately 200, but let me do exact division.

197.2 * 0.0147 = 2.895.

Wait, 197.2 * 0.01 = 1.972.

197.2 * 0.0047 = let's compute that. 0.0047 * 197.2 = 0.92564.

So 1.972 + 0.92564 = 2.89764. Hmm, that's a bit more than 2.895. So perhaps 0.01469 is more accurate, as I had earlier.

So 0.01469 mol.

Number of nuclei N is 0.01469 * 6.022e23.

Calculating 0.01469 *6.022e23:

0.01 *6.022e23 = 6.022e21,

0.00469 *6.022e23 = ?

0.004 *6.022e23 = 2.4088e21.

0.00069 *6.022e23 = approx 4.155e20.

Wait, 0.00069 is 6.9e-4.

6.9e-4 *6.022e23 = 6.9 *6.022e19 = approx 41.55e19 = 4.155e20.

So adding 2.4088e21 and 4.155e20 → 2.4088e21 + 0.4155e21 = 2.8243e21.

So total N = 6.022e21 + 2.8243e21 = 8.8463e21.

So N ≈ 8.8463e21 nuclei.

Now compute R = Φ * N * σ.

Φ = 1e7 n/cm²/s,

σ = 99e-24 cm²,

So R = 1e7 * 8.8463e21 * 99e-24.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, 1e7 * 8.8463e21 = 8.8463e28.

Then, 8.8463e28 * 99e-24 → 8.8463 * 99 = approximately 875.8227.

And 1e28 * 1e-24 = 1e4.

So 875.8227e4 → 8.758227e6.

So around 8.758e6 per second.

Looking at the options, E is 8.02e6. Hmm, but my calculation gives ~8.76e6. None of the options exactly match. Let me check if I made a mistake in the cross-section.

Wait, the cross-section is given as 99 barns. 1 barn is 1e-24 cm², right? So 99 barns = 99e-24 cm². Yes, that's correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the neutron flux is per cm², and the area of the gold sheet is 5 cm². But wait, no, because the flux is given per cm², so the total number of neutrons passing through the sheet per second would be flux * area, but the capture rate formula uses flux (per cm²) times cross-section (cm²) times nuclei (number). So perhaps my initial approach is correct.

Wait, but maybe I should have considered the flux as the total number of neutrons, but no. The flux is neutrons per cm² per second, so for each cm², 1e7 neutrons come per second.

But the area is 5 cm², so total neutrons per second passing through the sheet is 5 * 1e7 = 5e7 neutrons/s. But wait, no: the formula for reaction rate is R = Φ * N * σ. Because Φ is per cm², and when you multiply by N (number of nuclei in the entire volume), you get the total reactions in the entire volume.

Hmm, perhaps I should double-check the formula. The reaction rate R is given by the product of the neutron flux (Φ), the number of target nuclei (N), and the cross-section (σ). So yes, R = Φ * N * σ.

So in this case, Φ is 1e7 per cm² per second, N is the total number of nuclei in the entire gold sheet, and σ is 99e-24 cm².

So my calculation of R = 8.76e6 is correct, but the options don't have exactly that. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 6.02e23 → Way too big.

B: 9.15e8 → 0.915e9, which is bigger than my result.

C: 3.77e4 → Too small.

D: 2.50e9 → Also bigger than my result.

E: 8.02e6 → Close to my 8.76e6.

F: 5.89e22 → No.

G: 4.66e2 → No.

H: 1.23e5 → No.

I: 5e7 → No.

J:7.85e10 → Way too big.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Maybe the area wasn't considered correctly. Let me think again.

Wait, the gold sheet is 5 cm² in area. But the volume is 5 cm² * 0.03 cm = 0.15 cm³. That's correct.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the number of target nuclei should be per cm², but no, because the flux is already per cm², and the cross-section is per nucleus.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the number of nuclei per cm², then multiply by flux and cross-section and the area.

Let me think: N is the number of nuclei in the entire volume, which I calculated as ~8.85e21.

Flux is 1e7 n/cm²/s.

But the area is 5 cm², so does that affect anything? Wait, no, because flux is already given per cm², so the total number of neutrons is flux * area, but in the reaction rate, the formula R=Φ*N*σ already accounts for the entire volume, regardless of area. Because N is the total number of nuclei in the entire volume.

So perhaps the calculation is correct.

Wait, but let me compute 8.85e21 * 99e-24 = ?

8.85e21 * 99e-24 = 8.85 *99 * 1e-3 → 874.65 * 1e-3 = 0.87465.

Then multiply by flux 1e7: 0.87465 *1e7 = 8.7465e6, so approximately 8.75e6.

So the closest option is E:8.02e6. Wait, but that's somewhat lower. Did I miscalculate somewhere?

Wait, let me recompute the number of nuclei.

Mass is 2.895 grams.

Molar mass is 197.2 g/mol.

Moles = 2.895 / 197.2 = let's compute this more accurately.

197.2 * 0.0147 = ?

197.2 * 0.01 = 1.972.

197.2 * 0.0047 = let's compute 197.2 * 0.004 = 0.7888, and 197.2 * 0.0007 = 0.13804. So 0.7888 + 0.13804 = 0.92684.

So 1.972 + 0.92684 = 2.89884 grams.

But our mass is 2.895 grams, which is a bit less than 0.0147 moles. So perhaps 0.01469 moles is accurate.

N = 0.01469 * 6.022e23 = ?

Let me compute 0.01469 * 6.022e23.

0.01 *6.022e23 = 6.022e21.

0.00469 *6.022e23 = 0.00469 *6.022 = 0.028243, then multiplied by 1e23 → 2.8243e21.

So total N = 6.022e21 + 2.8243e21 = 8.8463e21.

So R = 1e7 * 8.8463e21 * 99e-24.

Compute 1e7 * 8.8463e21 = 8.8463e28.

8.8463e28 * 99e-24 = (8.8463 *99) * 1e4.

8.8463 *99 = let me compute that accurately.

8 *99 = 792.

0.8463 *99 = 83.8037.

So total 792 +83.8037 = 875.8037.

So 875.8037e4 = 8.758037e6.

So approximately 8.76e6.

Looking at the options, the closest is E:8.02e6, but that's a bit lower. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the cross-section unit.

Wait, 1 barn is 1e-24 cm², so 99 barns is 99e-24 cm². That's correct.

Wait, perhaps the area of the gold sheet isn't considered in the reaction rate. Because the reaction rate formula R = Φ * N * σ doesn't involve the area because Φ is per cm², and N is the total number of nuclei in the entire volume, which already accounts for the area.

Wait, but the gold sheet's thickness is thin (0.3 mm), but the area is 5 cm². But I think the way I calculated it is correct.

Wait another thought: perhaps the cross-section is per nucleus, so the total cross-section is N * σ, and then multiply by flux.

Yes, that's exactly what I did.

Wait, perhaps the question asks for the number of ^198Au nuclei produced per second. So each capture event produces one ^198Au nucleus.

So my calculation of ~8.76e6 would correspond to option E:8.02e6, but that's not exact. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps.

Wait, let me compute 8.76e6. None of the options exactly match this. So perhaps I made an error in the number of nuclei.

Wait, another approach: compute the number of moles correctly.

Mass = 19.3 g/cm³ * 0.15 cm³ = 2.895 g.

Molar mass = 197.2 g/mol.

Moles = 2.895 /
