Question:

Suppose a monopoly market has a demand function in which quantity demanded depends not only on market price (P) but also on the amount of advertising the firm does (A, measured in dollars). The specific form of this function is Q = (20 - P)(1 + 0.1A - 0.01A^2). The monopolistic firm's cost function is given by C = 10Q + 15 + A. Suppose there is no advertising (A = 0). What output will the profit-maximizing firm choose?

Options:

A: 20
B: 0
C: 12
D: 5
E: 8
F: 30
G: 15
H: 10
I: 18
J: 25

Okay, so I've got this economics problem here about a monopoly market. Hmm, I remember that in a monopoly, the firm is the sole supplier of a product, so they have a lot of price-setting power. The question is about finding the profit-maximizing output when there's no advertising. 

The problem gives me a demand function that depends on both the price (P) and advertising (A). Oh wait, but when A is zero, that simplifies things a bit. The demand function is Q = (20 - P)(1 + 0.1A - 0.01A²). So if A is zero, the second part becomes 1, right? Because 0.1*0 is zero, and 0.01*(0)^2 is also zero. So the demand simplifies to Q = 20 - P. 

Wait, no, because (1 + 0 + 0) is 1. So yeah, Q = (20 - P)*1 = 20 - P. So that makes the demand function Q = 20 - P when A=0. 

Now, the firm's cost function is C = 10Q + 15 + A. But again, since A is zero, the cost function becomes C = 10Q + 15. 

I need to find the output (Q) that maximizes profit. Profit is total revenue minus total cost. Total revenue (TR) is P times Q. But since I have Q in terms of P, maybe I should express everything in terms of Q.

Wait, let's express P in terms of Q from the demand equation. From Q = 20 - P, rearranging gives P = 20 - Q. 

So TR is P * Q = (20 - Q) * Q = 20Q - Q².

Total cost without advertising is C = 10Q + 15, so profit (π) is TR - C = (20Q - Q²) - (10Q +15). Let me calculate that:

π = 20Q - Q² -10Q -15 
Simplify that: 20Q-10Q is 10Q, so π = 10Q - Q² -15.

Hmm, that's a quadratic equation. To find the maximum, I can take the derivative with respect to Q and set it to zero, or I can complete the square. Since it's a quadratic, taking derivative is straightforward.

The derivative of π with respect to Q is dπ/dQ = 10 - 2Q. Setting this equal to zero for maximization:

10 - 2Q = 0 → 2Q = 10 → Q=5. 

Wait, so the output is 5? Let me check if that's correct. Alternatively, I could have completed the square. The profit equation is π = -Q² +10Q -15. The vertex of this parabola (which opens downward) is at Q = -b/(2a). Here, a is -1, b is 10. So Q = -10/(2*(-1)) )= 5. Same result.

So the profit-maximizing output is 5 units. Let me look at the options. Option D is 5. So the answer should be D.

To determine the profit-maximizing output for the monopolistic firm when advertising (A) is zero, we start by analyzing the given demand and cost functions. The demand function is:

\[
Q = (20 - P)(1 + 0.1A - 0.01A^2)
\]

When \( A = 0 \), the demand simplifies to:

\[
Q = 20 - P
\]

Rearranging this gives the inverse demand function:

\[
P = 20 - Q
\]

The total revenue (TR) is calculated as \( P \times Q \), which becomes:

\[
TR = (20 - Q) \cdot Q = 20Q - Q^2
\]

The cost function is given as:

\[
C = 10Q + 15 + A
\]

When \( A = 0 \), this simplifies to:

\[
C = 10Q + 15
\]

Profit (\( \pi \)) is total revenue minus total cost:

\[
\pi = TR - C = (20Q - Q^2) - (10Q + 15)
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\pi = 20Q - Q^2 - 10Q - 15 = 10Q - Q^2 - 15
\]

This is a quadratic equation in terms of \( Q \). To maximize profit, we take the derivative of \( \pi \) with respect to \( Q \) and set it to zero:

\[
\frac{d\pi}{dQ} = 10 - 2Q = 0
\]

Solving for \( Q \):

\[
10 - 2Q = 0 \implies Q = 5
\]

Thus, the profit-maximizing output is \( Q = 5 \). Comparing this result to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**D: 5**
