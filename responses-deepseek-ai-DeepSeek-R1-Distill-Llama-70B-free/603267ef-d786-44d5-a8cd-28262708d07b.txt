Okay, so I've got this field extension problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is asking for the degree of the field extension Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q. The options are given from A to J, and I need to pick the right one.

First, I remember that the degree of a field extension L over K, denoted as [L:K], is the dimension of L as a vector space over K. So I need to find the dimension of Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) over Q.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the fields here. The field is Q adjoined with sqrt(2), sqrt(3), and sqrt(18). Hmm, but maybe some of these are redundant because they can be expressed in terms of others. Like, sqrt(18) can be simplified. Let me calculate that.

So sqrt(18) is sqrt(9*2) which is 3*sqrt(2). Oh, right! So sqrt(18) is just 3 times sqrt(2). That means if I already have sqrt(2) in the field, then sqrt(18) doesn't add anything new because it's a multiple of sqrt(2), which is already present. So including sqrt(18) in the field extension doesn't change the field. So the field Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3), sqrt(18)) is the same as Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)). So that simplifies things a bit.

Now, I need to find [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) : Q]. I think this is a composite field extension. I remember that when you have multiple extensions, you can break it down into tower of extensions. Like, Q ⊂ Q(sqrt(2)) ⊂ Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)).

The degree of the composite field would be the product of the degrees of each individual extension if they are independent, I think. So first, [Q(sqrt(2)) : Q] is 2 because the minimal polynomial of sqrt(2) over Q is x² - 2, which is irreducible by Eisenstein's criterion with p=2. So that's degree 2.

Next, I need to find [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) : Q(sqrt(2))]. The minimal polynomial of sqrt(3) over Q(sqrt(2)) would be x² - 3. I should check if this is irreducible over Q(sqrt(2)). If it is, then [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) : Q(sqrt(2))] is 2, otherwise it's 1.

Wait, is x² - 3 irreducible over Q(sqrt(2))? Let me think. Suppose it factors into (x + a)(x - a) where a is in Q(sqrt(2)). Then a² = 3. But does a exist in Q(sqrt(2))? Let me see. The elements of Q(sqrt(2)) are of the form a + b*sqrt(2), where a and b are in Q. So suppose (a + b*sqrt(2))² = 3. Expanding that gives a² + 2ab*sqrt(2) + 2b² = 3. For this to be equal to 3, the coefficients of sqrt(2) must be zero, and the rational part must equal 3.

So 2ab = 0. So either a=0 or b=0. If a=0, then 2b² = 3 → b² = 3/2 → b is sqrt(3/2), which is not in Q. If b=0, then a² =3 → a is sqrt(3), which is also not in Q. Therefore, x² -3 is irreducible over Q(sqrt(2)), so [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) : Q(sqrt(2))] is 2.

Therefore, the total degree [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) : Q] is [Q(sqrt(2)) : Q] * [Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)) : Q(sqrt(2))] = 2 * 2 = 4.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Alternatively, another approach is to note that the degree of the composite field extension Q(a,b,c) over Q is the product of the degrees when each extension is of degree 2 and they're linearly disjoint. So since sqrt(2) and sqrt(3) are both degree 2 extensions and their minimal polynomials are irreducible over each other's fields, the total degree is 2*2=4.

So in the original problem, since sqrt(18) doesn't add anything, the field is just Q(sqrt(2), sqrt(3)), so the degree is 4.

Looking back at the options, option G is 4. So the answer should be G.

To determine the degree of the field extension \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{18}) \) over \( \mathbb{Q} \), we start by simplifying the field. Notice that \( \sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2} \), which is already in \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}) \). Therefore, \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{18}) = \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}) \).

Next, we compute the degree of \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}) \) over \( \mathbb{Q} \). We use the tower of extensions:

1. \( \mathbb{Q} \subset \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}) \subset \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}) \).

   - The degree \( [\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}) : \mathbb{Q}] \) is 2 because the minimal polynomial of \( \sqrt{2} \) over \( \mathbb{Q} \) is \( x^2 - 2 \), which is irreducible by Eisenstein's criterion.

   - Now, we find \( [\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}) : \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})] \). The minimal polynomial of \( \sqrt{3} \) over \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}) \) is \( x^2 - 3 \). To check if this is irreducible, assume \( x^2 - 3 \) factors as \( (x + a)(x - a) \) with \( a \in \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}) \). This would imply \( a^2 = 3 \). However, elements of \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}) \) are of the form \( a + b\sqrt{2} \), and solving \( (a + b\sqrt{2})^2 = 3 \) shows no such \( a \) and \( b \) exist in \( \mathbb{Q} \). Thus, \( x^2 - 3 \) is irreducible over \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}) \), and \( [\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}) : \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})] = 2 \).

   - The total degree is therefore \( [\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}) : \mathbb{Q}] = [\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}) : \mathbb{Q}] \cdot [\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}) : \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})] = 2 \cdot 2 = 4 \).

Thus, the degree of the field extension \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{18}) \) over \( \mathbb{Q} \) is 4.

The correct answer is **G**.
