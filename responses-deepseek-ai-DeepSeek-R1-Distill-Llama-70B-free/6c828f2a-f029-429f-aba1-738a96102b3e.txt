Question:

A nephew inherited a large parcel of unimproved land from his uncle. In need of cash, the nephew decided to sell the parcel. He contacted a real estate agent in the area about listing the parcel for sale. The nephew and the agent entered into a valid written contract whereby the agent promised to undertake best efforts to find a buyer for the parcel. The contract also provided that the agent was to be paid a commission of 5 percent on the gross sale price following the consummation of the sale and transfer of title. The agent succeeded in finding a buyer for the parcel. The agent notified the nephew that he had found a developer who wanted to purchase the parcel for $500,000. The agent handed the nephew a real estate sales contract, signed by the developer, in which the developer agreed to pay $500,000 for the purchase of the parcel. The nephew then signed the agreement himself. However, before consummation of the sale and transfer of title, the developer, without cause, repudiated the contract. Despite the agent's insistence, the nephew refused to either sue the developer to enforce the land sale contract or pay the agent his commission. If the agent sues the nephew for breach of the brokerage agreement, which of the following, if anything, is the agent's proper measure of recovery?

Options:

A: Nothing, because the nephew did not breach the brokerage agreement.
B: $25,000, or the commission equivalent of 5 percent on the sale of the property for $500,000, because all conditions precedent to the nephew's duty to pay the commission were substantially fulfilled when the nephew and the developer entered into the land sale contract.
C: $10,000, as a partial commission due to the agent's work done before the sale was cancelled.
D: $12,500, or half the commission, because the sale reached the halfway point when the nephew and the developer signed the contract.
E: Nothing, because as a third-party beneficiary of the contract between the nephew and the developer, the agent can enforce the contract only against the developer, but not against the nephew.
F: $25,000, or the commission equivalent of 5 percent on the sale of the property for$500,000, because fulfillment of the consummation condition was prevented by an event beyond the agent's control.
G: $25,000, because the agent provided a buyer and thus fulfilled his part of the contract.
H: Nothing, because the sale did not go through and hence no commission is due.
I: Nothing, because the consummation condition has not been fulfilled, and the nephew's refusal to sue the developer will not excuse that condition.
J: $25,000, because the agent upheld his end of the contract in making his best efforts to find a buyer for the parcel.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this real estate law question. Let me read it carefully.

So, the situation is that a nephew inherited some land and wants to sell it. He hires a real estate agent under a written contract. The agent's job is to use best efforts to find a buyer. The contract says the agent gets a 5% commission on the gross sale price after the sale is completed and title is transferred.

The agent finds a buyer, a developer, who offers $500,000. The developer signs the sales contract, and the nephew also signs it. But before the sale is finalized, the developer backs out without any valid reason. The nephew refuses to sue the developer to enforce the contract or pay the commission.

Now, the agent is suing the nephew for breach of their brokerage agreement. The question is about the proper measure of recovery for the agent.

The options are from A to J. I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that in real estate brokerage contracts, the agent typically gets paid when the sale is completed. That is, when title is transferred. If the sale doesn't go through, the agent usually doesn't get the commission unless certain conditions are met.

But wait, sometimes agents can get their commission even if the sale doesn't close, especially if they've found a ready, willing, and able buyer. But I think that's more when the seller does something wrong, like backs out without cause.

In this case, the developer (buyer) repudiated the contract without cause. The nephew could sue the developer for specific performance or damages, but he's refusing to do so. So the sale didn't happen because the buyer backed out, not the seller.

The agent had a best-efforts contract, not an exclusive or guaranteed sale contract. So the agent's duty was to try hard to find a buyer, which he did. But the contract probably requires that the sale actually closes for the commission to be paid.

Wait, but what about when a buyer breaches the contract? If the agent produced a buyer who was ready and willing, but the buyer then backs out, does that count as fulfilling the agent's part of the contract?

I think in that case, the agent might still be entitled to the commission because they've procured a buyer who is ready, willing, and able to purchase on the agreed terms. The failure to close is due to the buyer's breach, which is beyond the agent's control.

So the agent fulfilled his part by finding such a buyer, and the nephew's refusal to enforce the contract against the buyer might not affect the agent's right to commission.

Looking at the options, let's go through them:

Option A: Nothing, because the nephew didn't breach. But maybe the agent is suing for the commission, not breach by the nephew. So maybe A is incorrect.

Option B: $25k, 5% of 500k, because conditions precedent were substantially fulfilled when they signed the contract. So this is about whether the commission is due when the contract is signed, not when it closes. But the contract says commission is paid after consummation. So B might not be correct.

Option C: $10k as partial. I don't think partial commissions are standard unless the contract allows it, which it doesn't here.

Option D: Half commission because the sale reached halfway. Not sure about this, but again, the contract probably ties payment to closing.

Option E: Nothing because agent is a third-party beneficiary of the sale contract, can only sue the developer. Doesn't make sense because the agent's contract is with the nephew, so E is wrong.

Option F: $25k because the condition was prevented by an event beyond control. So this is about frustration or impossibility. The agent argues that the sale didn't happen because of the developer's breach, which the agent couldn't control. So under the contract, if the condition (closing) is prevented by something beyond the agent's control, the commission is still due. I'm not sure if that applies here. Typically, the risk of the buyer's breach would fall on the seller, but the agent's commission is tied to the closing.

Option G: $25k because agent found a buyer. This would be the case if the agent's duty was to procure a buyer, regardless of closing. But the contract says commission upon closing.

Option H: Nothing because sale didn't happen. This would be the case if the commission is strictly contingent on closing, which the contract states.

Option I: Nothing because consummation didn't occur, and nephew's refusal to sue doesn't change that. So the condition wasn't met, so no commission.

Option J: $25k because agent made best efforts. But making best efforts isn't enough if the sale doesn't close, unless the agent's efforts resulted in a ready, willing buyer.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

In real estate, there's the concept that if the agent finds a ready, willing, and able buyer who is ready to proceed, and the seller fails to close, the agent is entitled to the commission. So even if the sale doesn't close because the buyer breaches, the agent has done their job.

In this case, the agent found a buyer (developer) who signed the contract. The nephew also signed. Then the developer backed out. So the agent did procure a buyer, and the failure to close isn't the agent's fault.

So the agent should get the commission. The nephew is obligated to pay once the agent has found a suitable buyer, even if the sale doesn't close because of the buyer's breach.

So looking at the options, F says $25k because the condition was prevented by an event beyond the agent's control. That makes sense because the developer's breach prevented the closing, which was beyond the agent's control.

Wait, but the contract requires payment after consummation. So the condition is closing. If the closing is prevented by the buyer, does the agent still get paid?

I think in this scenario, the agent has earned the commission because they found a buyer who was ready and willing. The fact that the buyer then breached doesn't negate the agent's entitlement. So even though the condition of closing wasn't met, the agent's performance was complete when they found the buyer.

But the contract says commission is paid after consummation. So the condition precedent is the closing. If the condition isn't met, the agent might not get paid.

Wait, but some jurisdictions have a rule that if the agent has procured a buyer who is ready, willing, and able, the commission is due even if the sale doesn't close because the seller fails to perform. But in this case, the buyer failed to perform, not the seller.

So is the agent's commission due when the buyer breaches? Or is it only when the seller breaches?

The general rule is that the commission is due when the agent produces a buyer who is ready, willing, and able to buy on the seller's terms. Once that happens, the commission is earned, regardless of whether the sale actually closes. Because the agent has done their job in finding the buyer, the risk of the sale not closing (for any reason) is on the seller, not the agent.

So in this case, even though the developer (buyer) breached, the agent is still entitled to the commission because he found a buyer who was ready to go. The nephew's refusal to sue doesn't change that.

So the agent should get the $25k commission.

Looking at the options, B says $25k because all conditions were substantially fulfilled when the contract was signed. But the condition was consummation, which is closing. So that's not met.

Option F says $25k because the condition was prevented by an event beyond the agent's control. That's the developer's breach, which is beyond the agent's control. So F could apply.

Alternatively, option J says $25k because the agent upheld his best efforts. But the contract is about finding a buyer, not just best efforts.

Wait, the contract says "best efforts to find a buyer." So that might imply that the agent needs the sale to close, unless they've found a buyer who is ready.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again.

In a best efforts contract, the agent is required to use best efforts but doesn't guarantee a sale. The commission is typically due upon closing. However, if the agent finds a buyer who is ready and willing, and the seller fails to close, the agent is entitled to the commission.

In this case, the agent found a buyer, got both parties to sign, but the buyer backed out. So the agent has done his part, and the failure is on the buyer's side.

So the agent should still get the commission because he procured a buyer. Therefore, options B and F might apply, but I think F is about the condition being prevented, which would be the case here.

Wait, but the condition is the closing. If the condition is prevented by the buyer's breach, then the agent can argue that the failure wasn't their fault. So the commission is due.

So the correct answer would be F: $25k because the condition (closing) was prevented by an event beyond the agent's control.

Wait, but another thought: the contract requires that the agent's commission is due upon consummation. If the sale didn't occur, even if the agent found a buyer, the condition wasn't met. Unless the agent can argue that they're entitled to the commission once the buyer is procured, regardless of closing.

In some jurisdictions, the agent's commission becomes due when the buyer is procured, even if the sale doesn't close. But other places require the sale to close.

Given that the contract specifies payment after consummation, but the agent has procured a buyer, which is a substantial part of the contract, maybe the commission is still due.

So perhaps the answer is B or F.

Option B says that all conditions were substantially fulfilled when they entered the contract. So it's about substantial performance. But the condition is closing. So I'm not sure.

Alternatively, under the doctrine of constructive conditions, if the agent has done everything required to bring about the condition (finding a buyer), and the buyer's breach prevents the condition (closing), the agent can still recover.

So F's reasoning applies: the condition was prevented by an event beyond the agent's control.

Yes, I think F is correct. So the answer would be F: $25k because the condition was prevented by an event beyond the agent's control.

The question revolves around a real estate brokerage agreement where the agent is entitled to a 5% commission on the gross sale price after the consummation of the sale and transfer of title. The agent found a buyer, and both the nephew and the developer signed the sales contract for $500,000. However, the developer repudiated the contract without cause, and the nephew refused to enforce the contract or pay the commission. The issue is whether the agent is entitled to the commission despite the sale not closing.

### Key Analysis of the Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. The nephew did not breach the brokerage agreement, but the agent is suing for the commission, not for breach by the nephew.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. While the agent procured a buyer, the contract explicitly ties the commission to consummation of the sale. Substantial fulfillment of conditions precedent does not override the requirement for closing.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. Partial commissions are not standard unless the contract provides for them, which it does not here.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The contract does not provide for a halfway commission, and the commission is contingent on closing.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The agent's contract is with the nephew, not the developer, so the agent can sue the nephew for the commission.
- **Option F**: Correct. The agent is entitled to the commission because the condition of consummation was prevented by an event beyond the agent's control (the developer's breach). The agent fulfilled their obligation by finding a ready, willing, and able buyer.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. While the agent found a buyer, the contract ties payment to closing, not just finding a buyer.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The commission is due because the agent procured a ready, willing, and able buyer, even though the sale did not close due to the buyer's breach.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The nephew's refusal to sue the developer does not negate the agent's entitlement to the commission, as the agent fulfilled their part of the contract.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. While the agent made best efforts, the commission is tied to closing, not just effort.

### Conclusion:
The agent is entitled to the commission because they procured a ready, willing, and able buyer, and the failure to close was due to the developer's breach, which was beyond the agent's control. The proper measure of recovery is $25,000, or 5% of the $500,000 sale price.
