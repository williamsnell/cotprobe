Okay, so I've got this question here about finding the characteristic of the ring Z_3 x 3Z. Hmm, I remember that the characteristic of a ring is the smallest positive integer n such that n times any element in the ring is zero. If no such n exists, the characteristic is 0.

Wait, but first I need to understand what the ring Z_3 x 3Z is. Oh right, Z_3 is the integers modulo 3, so that's {0, 1, 2} with addition modulo 3. And 3Z is the set of multiples of 3, which is like {..., -3, 0, 3, 6, ...}. So the ring is the direct product of these two. 

But wait, the direct product of two rings is a ring where addition and multiplication are done component-wise. So each element is a pair (a, b) where a is in Z_3 and b is in 3Z. 

Now, the characteristic of a product ring is the least common multiple (LCM) of the characteristics of each component ring. So I should find the characteristic of Z_3 and the characteristic of 3Z first.

Z_3 is a ring modulo 3, so its characteristic should be 3 because 3*1 = 0 in Z_3. What about 3Z? Well, 3Z is a ring without unity (I think), and it's isomorphic to the integers. Wait no, wait. 3Z is the set of multiples of 3. So in 3Z, adding or subtracting multiples of 3. But wait, 3Z is actually a ring where every element can be written as 3k for some integer k. 

Wait, what's the characteristic of 3Z? Let me think. The characteristic is the smallest positive integer n where n*1 = 0. But in 3Z, the additive identity is 0, but there's no multiplicative identity unless you include 0, but 3Z doesn't have a 1. Wait, 3Z is a rng (a ring without identity). So in terms of characteristic, perhaps it's infinite? Because in the integers, the characteristic is 0 because there's no such n. But wait, 3Z is a subset of integers. Wait, no, in 3Z, for any element 3k, the additive order is infinite because you can add 3k to itself any number of times without getting back to 0 unless k is zero. So the characteristic of 3Z would be 0 because there's no finite n where n*(3k) = 0 for all 3k except when 3k=0. Wait, actually, 3Z is a free abelian group, so it's torsion-free, meaning the only element with finite order is 0. So the characteristic is 0.

Wait, but that doesn't sound right. Let me double-check. Because in 3Z, if you take 3*1, that's 3, which is in 3Z. But 3*(3k) = 9k, which is in 3Z. So wait, no. The characteristic is about multiplying the multiplicative identity, but since 3Z doesn't have a 1, maybe the characteristic is 0. Alternatively, maybe I'm misunderstanding the concept here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think of the characteristic as the smallest n such that n times any element is zero. Wait, but in 3Z, if you take any element, say 3k, and multiply it by n, you get n*3k. For this to be zero in 3Z, it needs to be 0. So n*3k = 0 implies 3kn = 0 in Z, which only happens when n=0 or k=0. But since we're considering the ring 3Z, for any non-zero element 3k (kâ‰ 0), n must be zero. But that's not possible because n is a positive integer. So there's no finite n where n*(3k) =0 for all elements. So the characteristic is 0.

So the characteristics are 3 (for Z_3) and 0 (for 3Z). Now, the characteristic of the product ring is the least common multiple of 3 and 0. Wait, but what's the LCM of 0 and another number? I think LCM with 0 is 0 because any number divides 0. So the characteristic of the product ring Z_3 x 3Z would be 0.

Wait, but wait. Another way: in the product ring, the characteristic is the smallest n such that n*(a,b) = (na, nb) = (0,0) for all a in Z_3 and b in 3Z. So for the first component, na =0 in Z_3. Since Z_3 has characteristic 3, n must be a multiple of 3. For the second component, nb=0 in 3Z. But in 3Z, as we thought earlier, the only way nb=0 is if n is 0, because for any n>0, if b is 3k, then nb = 3kn, which is zero only if k=0. But since b can be any element of 3Z, including non-zero ones, the only n that would satisfy nb=0 for all b in 3Z is n=0. Because for example, take b=3. Then n*3 must be 0, which only happens if n=0. So the only n that works for both components is 0. Hence, the characteristic of the product ring is 0.

So the answer must be option J: 0.

The characteristic of a ring is defined as the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that \( n \cdot a = 0 \) for all elements \( a \) in the ring. If no such \( n \) exists, the characteristic is \( 0 \).

The ring \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \times 3\mathbb{Z} \) is the direct product of two rings: \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) (the integers modulo 3) and \( 3\mathbb{Z} \) (the set of all multiples of 3). In a direct product ring, addition and multiplication are performed component-wise, so each element is a pair \( (a, b) \) where \( a \in \mathbb{Z}_3 \) and \( b \in 3\mathbb{Z} \).

To determine the characteristic of \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \times 3\mathbb{Z} \), we first analyze the characteristics of the individual components:

1. **Characteristic of \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \):**  
   \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is a ring with elements \( \{0, 1, 2\} \), where addition and multiplication are performed modulo 3. The smallest positive integer \( n \) such that \( n \cdot 1 = 0 \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is \( n = 3 \). Thus, the characteristic of \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \) is 3.

2. **Characteristic of \( 3\mathbb{Z} \):**  
   \( 3\mathbb{Z} \) consists of all multiples of 3, i.e., \( \{..., -3, 0, 3, 6, ...\} \). This is a torsion-free ring, meaning that the only element with finite order is 0. Since no finite \( n \) satisfies \( n \cdot b = 0 \) for all \( b \in 3\mathbb{Z} \), the characteristic of \( 3\mathbb{Z} \) is 0.

The characteristic of the product ring \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \times 3\mathbb{Z} \) is the least common multiple (LCM) of the characteristics of the individual rings. The LCM of 3 and 0 is 0 because any number divides 0. Therefore, the characteristic of \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \times 3\mathbb{Z} \) is 0.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**J: 0**
