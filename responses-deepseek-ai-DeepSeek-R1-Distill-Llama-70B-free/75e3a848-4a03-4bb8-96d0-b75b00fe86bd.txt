Okay, so I've got this problem here about the decay of Nitrogen-13 by beta-plus emission, and I need to find its nuclidic mass. Hmm, beta-plus emission is also known as positron emission, right? So in this process, a proton in the nucleus converts into a neutron, emitting a positron and a neutrino. The equation for that would be something like N-13 decaying into C-13 plus a positron and a neutrino. Wait, actually, more accurately, the parent nucleus emits a positron and a neutrino, turning a proton into a neutron. So the atomic number decreases by one.

The maximum kinetic energy given is 1.19 MeV. I remember that in beta decay, the maximum kinetic energy is related to the mass difference between the parent and the daughter atoms. Because in beta-plus decay, the parent must have a higher mass than the daughter.

So the formula I think is involved here is the one where the maximum kinetic energy (K_max) is equal to the mass defect multiplied by c squared, but considering the masses of the emitted particles. Wait, or is it that the Q value of the decay is equal to the total energy released, which includes the kinetic energy of the positron, the energy of the neutrino, and the rest mass of the positron?

Wait, more accurately, the Q value for beta-plus decay is given by Q = [M_parent - M_daughter - 2m_e]c², but wait, because when a proton converts to a neutron, a positron (mass m_e) and a neutrino (which has negligible mass) are emitted. So the mass difference between the parent and daughter is such that M_parent > M_daughter + 2m_e. Because the emitted positron has rest mass energy, but the neutrino's energy is negligible in this calculation, I think, or maybe it's ignored here.

Wait, no. Actually, the Q value is the total energy released. The maximum kinetic energy of the beta particle occurs when the neutrino has negligible kinetic energy. So the maximum kinetic energy (K_max) is equal to Q minus the rest mass energy of the positron. Or wait, maybe Q is the sum of the kinetic energy of the positron and the neutrino's energy. But in the maximum case, the neutrino's energy is zero, so all the Q goes into the positron's kinetic energy and its rest mass. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, let's think again. In beta-plus decay, the reaction is:

^A_ZX → ^A_{Z-1}Y + e^+ + ν.

The Q value for this reaction is given by:

Q = [M_X - M_Y - 2m_e]c².

Wait, because the parent X has mass M_X, the daughter Y has M_Y, and the positron and neutrino contribute. Since the neutrino's rest mass is almost zero, but the positron has rest mass m_e, so we account for the two m_e (because the positron has mass m_e, and the daughter has an extra neutron, so the mass difference includes the conversion of a proton into a neutron, which is (M_n - M_p)c², but I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here.

Alternatively, the Q value is the energy released, which is the mass difference between the initial and final states, considering the rest masses. So the initial state is the parent nucleus (N-13), and the final state is the daughter nucleus (C-13), a positron, and a neutrino. But the neutrino's rest mass is negligible, so we can approximate it as just considering M_parent > M_daughter + 2m_e.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The correct equation is:

M_parent c² = M_daughter c² + 2m_e c² + K_max.

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the Q value is the total energy available, which is the mass difference. So Q = (M_parent - M_daughter - 2m_e)c². And this Q equals the maximum kinetic energy of the positron (since the neutrino carries away some energy, but in the maximum case, the neutrino's energy is zero, so all Q goes into the positron's kinetic energy). Wait, but the positron's rest mass is m_e c², so when it's emitted, its total energy is K_max + m_e c². So the Q would be the sum of the kinetic energy and the rest mass energy, but Q is the energy released, so perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Let me try to recall the correct formula. In beta decay (beta-minus), the Q value is (M_parent - M_daughter - m_e)c², and the maximum kinetic energy of the electron is Q. But wait, in beta-plus decay, it's similar, but the positron's rest mass is accounted for.

Wait, more accurately, for beta-plus decay, the condition for decay to be possible is that M_parent > M_daughter + 2m_e. Because the mass of the parent must exceed the daughter's mass plus twice the electron mass (since a positron is emitted, along with a proton converting into a neutron, but the mass difference includes the 2m_e because the daughter's atomic mass includes an extra electron when considering atomic masses? Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of atomic masses versus nuclear masses.

Wait, another approach is to consider the atomic masses. Nitrogen-13 has an atomic number Z=7. When it undergoes beta-plus decay, it becomes Carbon-13, which has Z=6. So the reaction is:

^13_7N → ^13_6C + e^+ + ν.

The atomic mass of ^13_7N is M_N. The atomic mass of ^13_6C is M_C. The emitted positron has mass m_e, and the neutrino's mass is negligible.

So the Q value is the energy released, which equals the rest mass energy difference between the parent and the daughter, accounting for the emitted particles. So:

Q = (M_N - M_C - 2m_e)c².

Wait, wait. Because in the decay, the parent's atomic mass includes 7 electrons, and the daughter includes 6 electrons (since Carbon has Z=6). So when the positron is emitted, which is like adding an electron (since it's a positron), the total number of electrons is M_C would have 6 electrons, but the initial N has 7, so the emitted positron (which is +1 charge) would balance that. Hmm, I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, the mass of the parent atom is M_N, which includes 7 electrons. The daughter is Carbon-13, which has 6 electrons. So when the positron is emitted, which is a positive electron, the total number of electrons after decay is 6 (from C) plus the positron, which can be considered as 7 electrons in total. So the mass difference would be M_N = M_C + 2m_e + K_max/(c²). Because the emitted positron contributes its rest mass (m_e c²) and the maximum kinetic energy (K_max), and the neutrino's energy is zero in this case.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to write the atomic mass equation. The atomic mass of the parent (N-13) is equal to the atomic mass of the daughter (C-13) plus the mass of two electrons (because the positron and an electron annihilate?), but I'm not entirely confident.

Wait, no. Let me think. The reaction in terms of atomic masses would be:

M(^13_7N) = M(^13_6C) + m_e (for the positron) + energy (since energy is mass equivalent).

Wait, but also, the daughter Carbon has one less proton than Nitrogen, so it's like a proton turning into a neutron, emitting a positron and a neutrino. But I'm getting a bit stuck on how the atomic masses relate here.

Alternatively, considering the nuclear masses, the reaction is:

^13_7N → ^13_6C + e^+ + ν.

The atomic mass of Nitrogen includes 7 electrons, and Carbon includes 6. So the mass of Nitrogen would be the mass of its nucleus plus 7 electrons. Similarly, Carbon's atomic mass is its nucleus plus 6 electrons. The emitted positron is a +e, so when combined with an electron, they annihilate into energy.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the mass-energy equivalence. The Q value is the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted positron plus the rest mass of the positron (since the neutrino's energy is zero in the maximum case). So Q = K_max + 2m_e c². Wait, no. Because the positron's rest energy is m_e c², and the maximum kinetic energy is when all Q goes into the positron's kinetic energy and its rest mass. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, the Q value is actually the total energy available, which is the mass difference. So:

Q = (M_parent - M_daughter - 2m_e)c².

And the maximum kinetic energy of the positron is equal to Q, because in that case, the neutrino has zero energy. So:

K_max = (M_parent - M_daughter - 2m_e)c².

Wait, but that can't be, because the maximum kinetic energy is when the neutrino's energy is zero, so all the Q goes into the positron. But the Q already includes the rest mass of the positron. So perhaps the correct equation is:

K_max = Q - m_e c².

No, wait, maybe Q is the sum of the kinetic energy and the rest mass energy of the positron. So:

Q = K_max + m_e c².

But that would imply that M_parent c² = M_daughter c² + 2m_e c² + K_max.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the terms. Let me see.

Let me look up the formula for beta-plus decay. Oh wait, I can't look things up, but I have to think through. The general formula for the maximum kinetic energy in beta decay is K_max = [(M_parent - M_daughter) / c² - 2m_e] c².

Wait, that doesn't make sense dimensionally. Alternatively, K_max c² = (M_parent c² - M_daughter c² - 2m_e c²).

So, K_max = (M_parent - M_daughter - 2m_e) c².

Wait, but the units should work out: K_max is in energy (MeV), M_parent and M_daughter are in atomic mass units (amu), m_e is in amu. So, M_parent - M_daughter must be in amu, multiplied by c² to get energy.

So, rearranging:

M_parent = M_daughter + 2m_e + (K_max)/(c²).

But wait, K_max is given in MeV. So, I need to convert that to amu using the conversion factor.

I remember that 1 amu c² is approximately 931.5 MeV. So, to convert K_max from MeV to amu, I divide by 931.5.

So, M_parent = M_daughter + 2m_e + (K_max) / (931.5).

But wait, the daughter is Carbon-13. What's the atomic mass of Carbon-13?

I think the atomic mass of Carbon-12 is about 12 amu, but Carbon-13 would be a bit more. Let me try to recall. Carbon-12 has an atomic mass of about 12.000000 amu, but Carbon-13 has an atomic mass of approximately 13.003355 amu. Wait, that's one of the options, option A is 13.00335, which is close. Wait, but wait, the options are for N^13, so I'm trying to find M_parent, which is N^13.

Wait, but I don't know M_daughter, which is C^13. So I need to find M_parent (N^13) in terms of M_daughter (C^13), which I might have to look up or approximate.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write the equation in terms of known values.

Let me denote:

M_parent = M(N^13) = ?

M_daughter = M(C^13) = 13.003355 amu (I think that's correct, but I'm not 100% sure, but let's proceed.)

m_e = 0.00054858 amu (since 1 electron mass is about 0.00054858 amu).

K_max = 1.19 MeV.

So, according to the formula:

M(N^13) = M(C^13) + 2*m_e + (K_max)/(931.5 MeV/amu)

Wait, K_max is 1.19 MeV. So (K_max)/(931.5) = 1.19 / 931.5 ≈ 0.001279 amu.

So, M(N^13) = 13.003355 + 2*(0.00054858) + 0.001279.

Calculating each term:

2*m_e = 2 * 0.00054858 ≈ 0.00109716 amu.

Adding all together:

13.003355 + 0.00109716 ≈ 13.004452 amu.

Then add 0.001279: 13.004452 + 0.001279 ≈ 13.005731 amu.

Looking at the options, option J is 13.00573 amu, which seems to match.

Wait, but wait. Did I make a mistake in the formula?

Wait, the formula is K_max = (M_parent - M_daughter - 2m_e) c².

So, rearranged, M_parent = M_daughter + 2m_e + K_max/(c²).

But wait, the K_max is in MeV, so when I divide by 931.5 MeV/amu, it converts to amu.

Wait, but let me confirm the formula again. Let me think about units.

M_parent (amu) = M_daughter (amu) + 2m_e (amu) + (K_max (MeV)) / (931.5 MeV/amu).

Yes, that's correct.

So, M_parent = 13.003355 + 0.00109716 + (1.19 / 931.5).

Calculations:

1.19 / 931.5 ≈ 0.001279 amu.

So adding up:

13.003355 + 0.00109716 = 13.00445216.

Adding 0.001279 gives 13.005731 amu.

Looking at the options, option J is 13.00573, which matches.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option J is 13.00573 amu, which fits.

So the correct answer would be J.

But wait, I'm assuming the atomic mass of Carbon-13 is 13.003355 amu. Is that correct? Because Carbon-12 is exactly 12 amu, and Carbon-13 is about 13.003355 amu. Yes, that's correct.

So the calculation seems right, and the answer should be J: 13.00573 amu.
</think>

To determine the nuclidic mass of N^13, we analyze the beta-plus decay process:

\[
^13_7\text{N} \rightarrow ^13_6\text{C} + e^+ + \nu
\]

In beta-plus decay, the parent nucleus (N^13) emits a positron (\(e^+\)) and a neutrino (\(\nu\)), converting a proton into a neutron. The maximum kinetic energy of the emitted positron (\(K_{\text{max}}\)) is related to the mass difference between the parent and daughter nuclei, accounting for the rest mass energy of the positron.

The formula for the maximum kinetic energy is:

\[
K_{\text{max}} = (M_{\text{parent}} - M_{\text{daughter}} - 2m_e)c^2
\]

Rearranging to solve for the parent mass:

\[
M_{\text{parent}} = M_{\text{daughter}} + 2m_e + \frac{K_{\text{max}}}{c^2}
\]

### Known Values:
1. **Daughter mass (\(M_{\text{daughter}}\))**: The atomic mass of Carbon-13 (\(^13_6\text{C}\)) is approximately \(13.003355 \, \text{amu}\).
2. **Electron mass (\(m_e\))**: \(0.00054858 \, \text{amu}\).
3. **Maximum kinetic energy (\(K_{\text{max}}\))**: \(1.19 \, \text{MeV}\).
4. **Energy-to-mass conversion factor**: \(1 \, \text{amu} \cdot c^2 = 931.5 \, \text{MeV}\).

### Calculation:
1. Convert \(K_{\text{max}}\) to amu:
   \[
   \frac{K_{\text{max}}}{c^2} = \frac{1.19}{931.5} \approx 0.001279 \, \text{amu}
   \]

2. Calculate \(2m_e\):
   \[
   2m_e = 2 \cdot 0.00054858 \approx 0.00109716 \, \text{amu}
   \]

3. Add the terms to find \(M_{\text{parent}}\):
   \[
   M_{\text{parent}} = 13.003355 + 0.00109716 + 0.001279 \approx 13.005731 \, \text{amu}
   \]

### Final Answer:
The nuclidic mass of N^13 is approximately \(13.00573 \, \text{amu}\), which corresponds to option **J**.
