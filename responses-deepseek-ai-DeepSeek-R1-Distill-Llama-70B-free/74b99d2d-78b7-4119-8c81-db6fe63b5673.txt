Okay, so I've got this problem here: "The shortest distance from the curve xy = 8 to the origin is..." and I need to pick the correct answer from the options given. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the distance from a point to the origin can be found using the distance formula. If I have a point (x, y), the distance D from the origin (0,0) is sqrt(x² + y²). But since I'm looking for the minimum distance, maybe I can minimize this function somehow.

Wait, but the point (x, y) lies on the curve xy = 8. So I have a constraint: x times y equals 8. How do I incorporate that into finding the minimum distance?

Oh right! I think I can use calculus here, maybe Lagrange multipliers or substitution. Let me try substitution because it might be simpler.

Let me express y in terms of x from the curve equation. If xy =8, then y=8/x. So now I can substitute this into the distance formula.

So the distance squared (since the square root can complicate things, and minimizing D is the same as minimizing D squared) would be x² + (8/x)². Let's write that as D² = x² + (64)/(x²).

Now, to find the minimum, I can take the derivative of D² with respect to x and set it equal to zero.

So d(D²)/dx = 2x - (128)/(x³). Setting this equal to zero gives 2x = 128/x³. Multiply both sides by x³ to eliminate the denominator: 2x^4 = 128. Divide both sides by 2: x^4 = 64. Taking the fourth root, x = sqrt(8) or x = -sqrt(8), but since distance is positive, I'll consider x positive, so x=√8.

Wait, √8 is 2√2, right? Because 8 is 4*2, so sqrt(4*2)=2√2.

So x=2√2. Then y would be 8/(2√2) = 4/√2. Rationalizing the denominator, that's (4√2)/2 = 2√2. So y is also 2√2.

Wait, so the point on the curve closest to the origin is (2√2, 2√2). Then the distance is sqrt[(2√2)^2 + (2√2)^2] = sqrt[8 +8] = sqrt[16] =4. But wait, that's option A:4. But wait another moment, let me double-check.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Let me recalculate the distance. If x=2√2, then x squared is (2√2)^2 = 4*2=8. Similarly, y=2√2, so y squared is also 8. So x² + y² is 8+8=16. Square root is 4. So the distance is 4.

But wait, looking at the options, option A is 4. But I recall that sometimes the minimal distance for such hyperbola problems is 4, but I also thought maybe 2√2. Hmm, perhaps I should think about another approach.

Alternatively, maybe using geometry. The curve xy=8 is a hyperbola. The closest point on a hyperbola to the origin... I'm not sure about any geometric properties there. Maybe parametrizing it in terms of hyperbola parameters, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: maybe using the AM-GM inequality. Since we're dealing with products and sums. The distance squared is x² + y², and we have xy=8. Let me think if AM-GM can help here.

I know that for positive numbers, the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean. So (x² + y²)/2 >= sqrt(x² y²) = xy. Since xy=8, so (x² + y²)/2 >=8, so x² + y² >=16. Therefore, the minimal distance squared is 16, so minimal distance is 4. That matches what I got earlier.

So the minimal distance is 4, which is option A. But wait, let me look at the options again. The options are A:4, B:2√2, etc. So the correct answer should be A:4.

Wait, but earlier I thought that at x=2√2, y=2√2, the distance is 4. So that's correct. So the answer is A.

To find the shortest distance from the curve \( xy = 8 \) to the origin, we start by expressing the distance \( D \) from a point \((x, y)\) on the curve to the origin using the distance formula:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.
\]

Since the point \((x, y)\) lies on the curve \( xy = 8 \), we can substitute \( y = \frac{8}{x} \) into the distance formula. Squaring the distance to simplify the minimization process, we get:

\[
D^2 = x^2 + \left(\frac{8}{x}\right)^2 = x^2 + \frac{64}{x^2}.
\]

To minimize \( D^2 \), we take its derivative with respect to \( x \) and set it to zero:

\[
\frac{d(D^2)}{dx} = 2x - \frac{128}{x^3}.
\]

Setting \( \frac{d(D^2)}{dx} = 0 \), we solve:

\[
2x = \frac{128}{x^3} \implies 2x^4 = 128 \implies x^4 = 64 \implies x = \sqrt{8} = 2\sqrt{2}.
\]

Substituting \( x = 2\sqrt{2} \) into \( y = \frac{8}{x} \), we find:

\[
y = \frac{8}{2\sqrt{2}} = 2\sqrt{2}.
\]

Thus, the point on the curve closest to the origin is \( (2\sqrt{2}, 2\sqrt{2}) \). The distance is:

\[
D = \sqrt{(2\sqrt{2})^2 + (2\sqrt{2})^2} = \sqrt{8 + 8} = \sqrt{16} = 4.
\]

This result can also be confirmed using the AM-GM inequality, which shows that the minimum value of \( x^2 + y^2 \) under the constraint \( xy = 8 \) is 16, leading to a minimum distance of 4.

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**A: 4**
