Question:

What is validity?

Options:

A: Validity is the extent to which a test can be administered in different languages.
B: Validity is whether the test measures what the examiner wants it to measure and how well it measures it.
C: Validity is based solely on empirical evidence.
D: Validity is the degree to which a test predicts future performance.
E: Validity is the reliability of a test.
F: Validity is the level of difficulty of a test.
G: Validity is the length of time a test remains applicable.
H: Validity is the ease with which test results can be compared across different populations.
I: Validity is the consistency of test results over time.
J: Validity is the subjective interpretation of a test.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about validity. Hmm, I remember from my studies that validity has to do with testing, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact definition. Let me think through this.

The question is asking, "What is validity?" And there are options from A to J. I think validity in the context of tests or measurements refers to whether the test actually measures what it's supposed to. Like, if I create a test to measure someone's math skills, validity would be whether the test accurately reflects their actual math abilities.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Validity is the extent to which a test can be administered in different languages. Wait, that sounds more like a translation or cultural adaptation issue, not validity itself. So probably not A.

Option B: Validity is whether the test measures what the examiner wants it to measure and how well it measures it. This sounds right. I remember that validity is about the accuracy and relevance of the measurement. So B could be the correct answer.

Option C: Validity is based solely on empirical evidence. I think validity can involve empirical evidence, like through statistical tests, but I don't think it's solely based on that. There might be theoretical aspects too. So maybe C isn't correct.

Option D: Validity is the degree to which a test predicts future performance. Oh, wait, that's more like predictive validity, which is a type of validity. So D is a part of validity, not the whole definition.

Option E: Validity is the reliability of a test. No, reliability is different. Reliability is about consistency, like getting the same results each time you administer the test. Validity is about accuracy. So E is wrong.

Option F: Validity is the level of difficulty of a test. No, that's about how hard the test is, not whether it measures what it's supposed to. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Validity is the length of time a test remains applicable. Hmm, maybe that's about the test's shelf life or something, but not validity. I think that's more about the test's relevance over time, but not the core of validity.

Option H: Validity is the ease with which test results can be compared across different populations. This might relate to norms or standardization, but not validity itself.

Option I: Validity is the consistency of test results over time. Wait, that sounds like reliability again, not validity. So I isn't correct.

Option J: Validity is the subjective interpretation of a test. No, validity is more objective. It's about how well the test measures the intended construct, not personal opinions on it.

So putting it all together, the best answer seems to be option B. Validity is indeed about whether the test measures what it's supposed to and how well it does so.

The correct answer is B. Validity refers to whether a test measures what it is intended to measure and how effectively it does so.

B
