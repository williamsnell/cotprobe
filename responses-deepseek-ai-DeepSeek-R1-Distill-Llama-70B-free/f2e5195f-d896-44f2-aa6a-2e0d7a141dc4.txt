Okay, so I've got this population biology question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about the tendency of a population to keep growing even after replacement fertility has been achieved. Hmm, replacement fertility... I remember that's when the fertility rate is just enough to replace the current population, so basically a fertility rate of about 2.1 in most countries. That's when each couple has on average two kids, accounting for some mortality rates.

The options are A through I. Let me go through them one by one. 

Option A: Homeostatic plateau. I think homeostasis is about maintaining a stable state. Maybe in population terms, a plateau could mean a stable population size. But the question is about continuing to grow after replacement, so this doesn't sound right. Unless it's a plateau at a higher population, but I'm not sure.

Option B: Demographic imbalance. That sounds like when the population isn't in balance, maybe too many old or young people. But how does that relate to growth after replacement fertility? Maybe not directly.

Option C: Population inertia. Inertia is the idea that something keeps moving in a direction because of momentum. So population inertia might mean that even if fertility rates drop, the population keeps growing because of the existing age structure. That could fit, but I'm not certain if that's the exact term used.

Option D: Demographic momentum. I've heard this term before. Momentum in demographics... like, even if fertility is at replacement level, the population continues to grow because the age distribution has a lot of young people who will reproduce. So the population's growth has momentum, continuing even when fertility is low. That seems to fit the question perfectly.

Option E: Rapid growth rate. That's more about how fast the population is growing, not specifically about growth after replacement fertility. So probably not this.

Option F: Zero population growth. That's when the population stops growing, right? So when births equal deaths. But the question is about growth continuing, so this is the opposite.

Option G: Fertility transition. That's part of the demographic transition model, where fertility rates drop. But I'm not sure how that relates to the continued growth after replacement.

Option H: Fertility momentum. That's a new term for me, but it might be similar to demographic momentum. Wait, maybe it's the same concept? Or perhaps it's a distractor. I'm not sure. I'll have to think about this.

Option I: Demographic transition. That's the model describing how population grows and changes as society develops, moving through stages from high birth and death rates to low. But the question is about a specific phenomenon, not the overall transition.

So, back to the main point. The concept is that once a population has a certain age structure with many young people, even if fertility drops to replacement levels, the population continues to grow because those young people will have their own children. This is called demographic momentum or population momentum.

Wait, so options C and D are similar. Let me think. I remember that "demographic momentum" is a term used to describe this situation. Population inertia—I'm not as sure about that term. Maybe it's another way to say the same thing, but I think the more commonly used term is demographic momentum. 

So the correct answer should be D: demographic momentum. Option C might be a distractor, but I think D is the right choice.

The question asks about the tendency of a population to continue growing even after replacement fertility has been achieved. Replacement fertility is typically a fertility rate of about 2.1, where each couple replaces themselves in the population. The key concept here is that the population’s age structure, particularly a large proportion of young people, drives continued growth even when fertility rates drop to replacement levels. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as **demographic momentum**.

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Homeostatic plateau** refers to a stable state, which does not fit the context of continued growth.
- **B: Demographic imbalance** relates to an uneven age distribution but does not specifically describe the growth phenomenon.
- **C: Population inertia** suggests a continuation of trends due to existing conditions, but it is not the commonly used term for this concept.
- **D: Demographic momentum** is the correct term describing how a population continues to grow due to its age structure, even after fertility rates reach replacement levels.
- **E: Rapid growth rate** describes the speed of growth, not the specific phenomenon of growth after replacement fertility.
- **F: Zero population growth** is the opposite, where growth stops.
- **G: Fertility transition** refers to changes in fertility rates over time, not the continued growth after replacement fertility.
- **H: Fertility momentum** is not a standard term and likely a distractor.
- **I: Demographic transition** is a broader model of population change, not the specific phenomenon described.

The correct answer is **D: Demographic momentum**, as it accurately describes the continued growth of a population due to its age structure, even after replacement fertility is achieved.
