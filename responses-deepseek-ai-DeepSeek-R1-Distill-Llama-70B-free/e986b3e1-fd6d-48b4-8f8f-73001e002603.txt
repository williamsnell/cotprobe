Okay, so I need to figure out which principle defines utilitarianism. I remember that utilitarianism is a theory in ethics, and it's about outcomes. Let me think. I think it's related to the idea of the greatest good for the greatest number. So, the main idea is to maximize overall happiness or utility.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one aligns with that. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Maximising personal pleasure. Wait, that sounds more like hedonism. Utilitarianism isn't just about personal pleasure; it's about the overall good. So A is probably not correct.

Option B: Maximisation of outcomes for individuals. Hmm, not sure. It's a bit vague. I think it's more about the collective outcome, not just individual ones. So maybe not B.

Option C: The least worst outcome for everybody. That sounds more like minimizing harm, maybe like a minimax approach, but I'm not sure if that's utilitarianism. It could be another theory.

Option D: Equality of opportunity. That's more about fairness and justice, perhaps from a different ethical theory like egalitarianism. So D might not be the right choice.

Option E: Equality for everyone. Again, this is more about equal treatment rather than the utilitarian focus on outcomes. So E doesn't seem right.

Option F: The best outcome for the minority. No, utilitarianism is about the majority, not the minority. So F is the opposite of what I'm thinking.

Option G: Ensuring no harm. That sounds like the non-maleficence principle in medical ethics, not utilitarianism. So G isn't it.

Option H: The best outcome for the majority. That rings a bell. Utilitarianism is about the greatest good for the greatest number, which implies the majority. So H looks promising.

Option I: The least worst outcome for the majority. Hmm, that's a bit different. It's about minimizing the worst outcomes, which might relate more to risk management or another principle, not the maximum good.

Option J: Maximizing wealth and resources. While that might be part of some economic theories, utilitarianism is broader, focusing on overall happiness or utility, not just wealth.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be H: The best outcome for the majority of people.

The principle that defines utilitarianism is the focus on achieving the greatest good for the greatest number, which translates to maximizing overall happiness or utility. Among the options provided, Option H aligns with this definition as it emphasizes "The best outcome for the majority of people."

Answer: H
