Okay, so I've got this fiscal policy question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is asking which fiscal policy combination would most likely slowly increase real GDP without putting too much upward pressure on the price level. The options are from A to J, each with different combinations of government spending and tax changes.

Hmm, I remember that fiscal policy involves the government using spending and taxation to influence the economy. Expansionary fiscal policy, like increasing government spending or cutting taxes, tends to stimulate the economy, which would increase GDP. But it can also cause inflation if the economy is already near full employment because too much money chases too few goods.

Wait, the question wants a slow increase in GDP and minimal upward pressure on prices. So maybe a moderate expansionary policy? Or perhaps a balanced approach where the effects don't push prices too high.

Let me go through the options one by one.

Option A: Increase government spending with no change in taxes. That's expansionary because higher spending injects money into the economy. But since taxes aren't changed, the deficit might increase, which could be inflationary in the long run. But does it cause too much pressure on prices? Maybe, because more spending without offsetting taxes could boost demand a lot.

Option B: Increase government spending and decrease taxes. That's like doubling down on expansion. Both actions increase aggregate demand. This would likely cause a more significant increase in GDP but might also lead to higher inflation because there's more money in the system and more government spending. So this might put too much upward pressure on prices.

Option C: Increase taxes and decrease government spending. That's contractionary. Both actions would reduce aggregate demand, which would lower GDP and maybe combat inflation. But the question is about increasing GDP, so this seems opposite of what we want.

Option D: Decrease government spending with no change in taxes. This is also contractionary since lower spending reduces demand. So GDP would likely go down, which isn't what we want here.

Option E: Decrease taxes with no change in government spending. Cutting taxes increases disposable income, so people spend more, which boosts GDP. But since spending isn't changing, the fiscal stimulus is moderate. This might lead to a slow increase in GDP without too much inflation because it's just tax cuts without additional spending. But wait, depends on how the tax cuts are structured. If they're across the board, it could stimulate demand but maybe not overheat the economy if done gradually.

Option F: No change in taxes with a decrease in government spending. That's contractionary again, as spending is down. So GDP would drop, which isn't the goal.

Option G: Decrease government spending and increase taxes. That's highly contractionary, so GDP would fall. Not the right choice.

Option H: No change in spending with an increase in taxes. Raising taxes reduces disposable income, so people spend less. That's contractionary. Again, not what we need.

Option I: Increase taxes and increase government spending. Hmm, this is interesting. If both are increased by the same amount, it might not have a net effect on the budget deficit. The tax increase takes money out of the economy, and spending puts it back. But the effect on GDP depends on where the money is spent. If the government spends on productive areas, it could have a positive effect, but the tax increase might offset some of it. So the net effect might be a small increase in GDP without much inflation because the two actions kind of balance each other. However, this might not be as effective as just a tax cut because the tax increase could dampen consumer spending.

Option J: Decrease taxes and increase government spending. That's expansionary, like option B but in reverse. Both actions increase demand. So this would likely cause a significant increase in GDP but also more inflation. So this might put too much pressure on prices.

Wait, the question is about a slow increase in GDP without too much price pressure. So maybe a moderate expansion. Let's think about the options again.

Option E is a tax cut without spending changes. That could increase demand but maybe not as much as increasing both spending and taxes. Or maybe it's better because it doesn't add as much to the deficit. Wait, actually, cutting taxes without increasing spending would increase the deficit, right? Because the government is taking in less and spending the same. That could lead to more borrowing, which might have different effects.

Alternatively, option E's effect on GDP: lower taxes mean higher disposable income, leading to more consumption. The multiplier effect from taxes is usually smaller than government spending because people might save some of the tax cut. So the increase in GDP would be moderate, which fits the 'slow' increase. Also, the price level pressure might be lower because the stimulus isn't as strong as options B or J.

Option I, where taxes and spending both increase, might lead to a balanced approach. But if the government increases spending and taxes by the same amount, the net effect on the budget is zero. So it's like moving money from taxpayers to the government for spending. If the government spends in areas with high multipliers, it could boost GDP more than the tax increase would reduce it. But I'm not sure which effect dominates. It might result in a small increase in GDP but perhaps not as slow as option E.

Wait, the question is looking for the combination that would 'slowly' increase GDP. So perhaps a more gentle approach is better, like a tax cut without increased spending. That would provide some stimulus without overheating the economy. So option E would be the choice here.

To determine which fiscal policy combination would most likely slowly increase real GDP without putting tremendous upward pressure on the price level, we analyze the options as follows:

- **Option A**: Increasing government spending without changing taxes is expansionary, as it injects money into the economy. However, the deficit increase could lead to inflation, making this less suitable for the goal of minimal price pressure.

- **Option B**: Increasing government spending and decreasing taxes is a strongly expansionary combination, as both actions boost aggregate demand. This would likely cause a significant increase in GDP but could also lead to higher inflation, making it less ideal.

- **Option C**: Increasing taxes and decreasing government spending is contractionary, reducing aggregate demand and lowering GDP. This is the opposite of what is desired.

- **Option D**: Decreasing government spending without changing taxes is also contractionary, as it reduces demand and lowers GDP. This does not align with the goal of increasing GDP.

- **Option E**: Decreasing taxes without changing government spending increases disposable income, boosting consumption and GDP. The effect is moderate, as the tax cut provides stimulus without additional spending, leading to a slow increase in GDP with minimal inflation pressure.

- **Option F**: No change in taxes with a decrease in government spending is contractionary, reducing demand and lowering GDP. This is not suitable.

- **Option G**: Decreasing government spending and increasing taxes is highly contractionary, leading to a significant drop in GDP. This is not appropriate.

- **Option H**: No change in spending with an increase in taxes is contractionary, as higher taxes reduce disposable income and spending. This lowers GDP and is not the desired outcome.

- **Option I**: Increasing taxes and government spending by the same amount balances the budget but may have a small net effect on GDP. While it could lead to a moderate increase in GDP, the tax increase might offset some of the stimulus from spending, making it less effective than Option E.

- **Option J**: Decreasing taxes and increasing government spending is strongly expansionary, similar to Option B, and would likely cause significant inflation, making it less suitable.

Given the goal of a slow increase in GDP with minimal upward pressure on prices, **Option E**—decreasing taxes with no change in government spending—provides a moderate stimulus through higher disposable income, leading to a gradual increase in GDP without overheating the economy.
