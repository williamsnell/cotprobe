Okay, so I've got this question here about finding the median of a data set. Let me think through this step by step. The data given is 23, 13, 18, 29, 32, 25. Hmm, I remember that the median is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in order. But wait, how exactly do I do that?

First, I think I need to sort the numbers from smallest to largest. Let me list them out again: 23, 13, 18, 29, 32, 25. So, arranging them in order. Let's see, the smallest number is 13, then 18, then 23, followed by 25, then 29, and the largest is 32. So when sorted, it's 13, 18, 23, 25, 29, 32.

Now, since there are six numbers here, which is an even count, I recall that the median would be the average of the two middle numbers. Wait, how do I find the two middle numbers in an even set? Oh right, for an even number of observations, you take the average of the (n/2)th and (n/2 + 1)th terms. So here, n is 6, so 6 divided by 2 is 3. So the third and fourth numbers.

Looking at the sorted list: the third number is 23, the fourth is 25. So I need to average these two. Let me calculate that. 23 plus 25 is 48. Divided by 2 is 24. So the median should be 24.

Now looking at the options, the choices are A through J. Let me check each one. Option J is 24. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, did I do everything right? Let me double-check. The data sorted is 13, 18, 23, 25, 29, 32. Positions 3 and 4 are 23 and 25. Average is 24. Yep, that's right. So the answer must be J.

The median is found by sorting the data and averaging the middle values. Sorting 23, 13, 18, 29, 32, 25 gives 13, 18, 23, 25, 29, 32. With six numbers, the median is the average of the third and fourth numbers: (23 + 25)/2 = 24. 

The correct answer is J: 24.
