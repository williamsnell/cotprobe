Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about luminous intensity. Hmm, I remember that luminous intensity has something to do with how bright a light is in a particular direction. Let me think about what I learned in class.

The problem says there's a spotlight with a 32-candle bulb. It concentrates the beam on a vertical area of 125 square feet, and this is at a distance of 100 feet. I need to find the luminous intensity of the spot in the beam direction.

Wait, I think luminous intensity is measured in candelas, right? And it's related to how the light spreads out. Oh right, the formula! I remember something about intensity being the candlepower multiplied by the area divided by the distance squared. Or was it the other way around?

Wait, no, maybe it's the total luminous flux divided by the solid angle. Oh wait, flux is in lumens, and intensity is candelas. Oh right, the formula is I = Φ / Ω, where Φ is the luminous flux and Ω is the solid angle in steradians.

But wait, another approach. I think there's a relation involving the area. So maybe the intensity is the source's candlepower times (area)/(distance squared). Or wait, is it I = (L * A) / d²? No, that doesn't sound right.

Wait, candlepower is the same as candelas, right? So the bulb is 32 candelas. But when the light is focused into a beam, the intensity in that direction increases. Oh wait, no, wait. The bulb itself emits 32 candelas as its intensity in all directions, but when it's focused, the same total flux is concentrated into a smaller area. Or wait, no. Maybe I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach: the formula for the intensity of a spotlight is I = (L * A) / (d² * θ²), but that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, maybe I should think about the area being illuminated. The area is 125 ft² at 100 ft. So the solid angle would be the area divided by the distance squared times some factor, because solid angle is in steradians and steradians are (m²)/(m²), so unitless.

Wait, solid angle Ω is equal to the area divided by the square of the distance. So Ω = A / d². But wait, no, solid angle is in steradians, which is A/(r²), yes. So Ω = 125 / (100)^2 = 125 / 10,000 = 0.0125 steradians.

But wait, the bulb's total intensity is 32 candelas. But that's the total flux emitted in all directions, right? Because a 32-candle bulb emits 32 candelas in all directions, so the flux Φ would be I * 4π steradians, since a sphere has 4π steradians. Wait, no, that's the total flux. So flux Φ = I * 4π. So if the bulb is 32 candelas, Φ = 32 * 4π ≈ 32*12.566 ≈ 402 lumens? Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, because the bulb's intensity is 32 candelas. So the total flux emitted is 32 candelas * 4π steradians, which gives the total flux Φ in lumens. So Φ = 32 * 4π ≈ 402.123 lumens.

But in this problem, the spotlight concentrates the beam onto an area of 125 ft² at 100 ft. So the solid angle here is Ω = A/(d²) = 125/(100)^2 = 125/10000 = 0.0125 sr.

Wait, but if the bulb emits Φ_total = 32 * 4π, and the spotlight is focusing all that flux into a solid angle of 0.0125 sr, then the intensity in the direction of the beam would be I = Φ_spot / Ω. Because intensity is flux per solid angle.

Wait, no, wait. Because if the spotlight's total flux is being concentrated into Ω, then Φ_spot = I * Ω. So I = Φ_spot / Ω.

But what's Φ_spot? If the bulb emits Φ_total = 32 * 4π, but the spotlight only emits into a small solid angle Ω, then Φ_spot = Φ_total * (Ω / (4π)) )? No, wait, that would be if the light is uniformly emitted in all directions, but the spotlight is focusing it. Alternatively, perhaps all the flux is concentrated into that Ω. So Φ_spot = I * Ω. So I = Φ_spot / Ω.

But wait, Φ_spot is the total flux of the beam. So if the bulb's total flux is 32 *4π, but the spotlight only emits a beam with solid angle Ω, then the flux in that beam would be Φ_spot = 32 * (Ω / (4π)) ) * 4π? Hmm, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe the bulb's luminous intensity is 32 candelas in all directions, but when focused, the intensity in the direction of the beam becomes higher.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. The formula for the intensity of a spotlight is I = (L * A) / (d²). No, wait, perhaps that's not the right formula. Or is it I = (candlepower) * (A / d²) ? Hmm.

Alternatively, there's a formula that relates the intensity to the area and distance. The luminous intensity I is given by the formula I = (L * A) / d², where L is the luminous flux per unit area (like illuminance), A is the area, and d is the distance.

Wait, no, another approach: the total luminous flux Φ is equal to I * Ω. So if the bulb emits 32 candelas in all directions, then Φ_total = 32 * 4π. But in this problem, the spotlight is focusing all that flux into a smaller solid angle Ω. So the intensity in that direction would be I = Φ_total / Ω.

Wait, that makes sense. Because Φ_total is the total flux emitted by the bulb, which is I_bulb * 4π. So if the spotlight focuses all that flux into a solid angle Ω, then the intensity I_spot = Φ_total / Ω.

So let's compute that.

Φ_total = 32 candelas * 4π steradians ≈ 32 * 12.566 ≈ 402.1 lumens.

Ω is the solid angle of the beam, which is the area it's covering divided by the distance squared. So Ω = 125 ft² / (100 ft)^2 = 125 / 10000 = 0.0125 sr.

So I_spot = Φ_total / Ω = (32 *4π) / 0.0125.

Wait, wait, but 32 candelas is the bulb's intensity. So Φ_total is 32 *4π. So I_spot = (32 *4π) / (A/d²). Wait, no, wait, the solid angle Ω is A/d², which is 0.0125 sr. So I_spot = (32 *4π) ) / 0.0125.

Let me compute that:

32 *4 = 128.

128 * π ≈ 402.12386.

Then, 402.12386 / 0.0125 = ?

Let me compute 402.12386 / 0.0125.

Well, 0.0125 is 1/80. So dividing by 0.0125 is the same as multiplying by 80.

So 402.12386 *80 = ?

400 *80 = 32,000.

2.12386 *80 ≈ 169.90.

So total is approximately 32,000 + 169.9 ≈ 32,169.9 candelas.

Wait, but the options are multiples like 32,000 is option G, and 40,000 is option J.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

Φ_total = 32 candelas *4π = approx 32 *12.566 = 402.1.

Ω = 125 / (100^2) = 125 /10,000 = 0.0125 sr.

I_spot = Φ_total / Ω = 402.1 / 0.0125 = ?

So 402.1 /0.0125.

We can compute 402.1 / 0.0125.

Well, 0.0125 is 1/80, so 402.1 *80 = ?

400 *80 = 32,000.

2.1 *80 = 168.

Total is 32,168. So approximately 32,168 candelas. Looking at the options, option G is 32,000, which is close. So the correct answer would be G:32,000 candles.

Wait, but wait a second. Another approach: the intensity formula when a source is focused into a certain solid angle.

I think another formula is: I = (n * L) / (A), where n is the distance, A is the area. Or wait, maybe it's I = (candlepower) * (A) / (d²). No, that doesn't fit the units.

Wait, perhaps the formula is that the intensity is equal to (flux per unit area at distance d), but I'm getting confused again.

Alternatively, perhaps to find the luminous intensity, it's given by I = (L * 4π) / Ω, where L is the total flux.

Wait, in this case, L is 32 candelas, but wait, no, L is the luminous flux in lumens. Oh wait, wait, no, because I think I'm mixing terms here.

Wait, the bulb's luminous intensity is 32 candelas. So in all directions, the bulb emits 32 candelas, so the total flux is 32 *4π = 128π ≈402.1 lumens.

But when focused into a solid angle Ω=0.0125 sr, the intensity in that direction is I = Φ_total / Ω = 402.1 /0.0125≈32,168 candelas.

Ah, so the correct answer is approximately 32,000, which is option G.

So I think the answer is G.
</think>

To determine the luminous intensity of the spotlight in the beam direction, we start by noting that the bulb has a luminous intensity of 32 candelas. The total luminous flux emitted by the bulb is given by:

\[
\Phi_{\text{total}} = I \cdot 4\pi = 32 \cdot 4\pi \approx 402.1 \, \text{lumens}.
\]

The spotlight concentrates this flux into a smaller solid angle, which is calculated using the area and distance:

\[
\Omega = \frac{A}{d^2} = \frac{125}{100^2} = \frac{125}{10,000} = 0.0125 \, \text{steradians}.
\]

The luminous intensity in the beam direction is then given by:

\[
I_{\text{spot}} = \frac{\Phi_{\text{total}}}{\Omega} = \frac{402.1}{0.0125}.
\]

Performing the division:

\[
I_{\text{spot}} = 402.1 \cdot 80 = 32,168 \, \text{candelas}.
\]

This value is approximately 32,000 candelas, which corresponds to option G.
