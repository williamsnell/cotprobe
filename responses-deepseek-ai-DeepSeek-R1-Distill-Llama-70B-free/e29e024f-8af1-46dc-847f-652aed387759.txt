Okay, so I have this problem about a shunt motor, and I need to find two currents: one when the field rheostat is cut out, and another when the field current is halved. Hmm, I remember that shunt motors have the field and armature circuits connected in parallel. Right, so the supply voltage is across both.

The problem says that when the field rheostat is cut out, the motor generates a counter emf of 220 volts at no load. Wait, counter emf is the same as back emf, right? So that's 220 V when there's no load. The armature resistance is 2.3 ohms, and the field resistance is 115 ohms.

Part (a) asks for the current through the armature when the field rheostat is cut out. Oh wait, cutting out the field rheostat probably means that the field circuit is connected directly without any external resistance. So the field current would be determined by the field resistance and the supply voltage.

Wait, no. Wait, when the field rheostat is cut out, the field resistance is just the field coil's resistance, which is 115 ohms. So the field current I_f would be V / R_f. The supply voltage is 230 volts, but wait, the back emf is 220 V. Wait, no, at no load, the counter emf is 220 V. So when the motor is running at no load, the back emf is 220 V. So what's the relation between that and the supply voltage?

Wait, the supply voltage is 230 V. So, when the motor is running, the back emf plus the armature's Ia*Ra equals the supply voltage. Oh, right, E_b = V - I_a * R_a.

Wait, wait, no: For a motor, the back emf is E_b = V - I_a * R_a. So in this case, when the field rheostat is cut out, the field current is I_f = V / R_f because the field is directly connected. So V is 230 V, R_f is 115 ohms, so I_f = 230/115 = 2 amperes.

Wait, but what about the armature current? Oh, wait, at no load, the motor is running, so the counter emf is 220 V. So E_b is 220 V. So using E_b = V - I_a * R_a.

Wait, but wait, is that correct? Because the armature current I_a is the total current drawn from the supply. But in a shunt motor, the field current is separate. So the supply current is I_a + I_f, but in this case, when the field is connected directly, I_f is 2 A as calculated.

Wait, but when the field is cut out, does that mean the field is connected directly across the supply? So the field current is I_f = 230/115 = 2 A. And the armature is also connected across the same supply. But at no load, the armature current is small because the motor isn't doing any work, so I_a is probably just the no-load current, but that's where the back emf comes into play.

Wait, but the problem says that when the field rheostat is cut out, the motor generates a counter emf of 220 volts at no load. So I think I can use E_b = V - I_a * R_a. Because the back emf is 220 V, and the supply is 230 V. So 220 = 230 - I_a * 2.3. Solving for I_a: I_a = (230 - 220) / 2.3 = 10 / 2.3 ≈ 4.347 amperes. So about 4.35 A. Hmm, looking at the options, that's the first part of some options. Like option F or G or I or J.

Wait, but wait, the armature current at no load is just the current needed to keep it running, which is usually small, but I'm getting about 4.35 A. That seems a bit high. Maybe I'm making a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps the field current is calculated differently. Wait, when the field is connected directly, the field current is 230/115 = 2 A, correct. But the armature's current under no load would be I_a = (V - E_b) / R_a. So (230 - 220)/2.3 = 10/2.3 ≈4.347 A. So that's correct.

So part (a) is approximately 4.35 A. Looking at the options, options F, G, I, J have 4.35 as the first value.

Part (b) asks for the armature current when the external resistance in the field circuit makes the field current half as much. So field current would now be 1 A instead of 2 A. So I_f is 1 A.

Wait, but wait. The field current is I_f = V / (R_f + R_ext), where R_ext is the external resistance. Since I_f is now 1 A, then R_f + R_ext = 230 / 1 = 230 ohms. Since R_f is 115, R_ext would be 115 ohms. So we've added 115 ohms in series with the field.

Now, with this change, we need to find the new armature current. But wait, the field current has changed, which would change the flux, which affects the back emf. Wait, but the problem doesn't give any information about how the flux changes with field current. That complicates things because the back emf depends on the flux, which depends on the field current.

Hmm, but perhaps the problem is assuming that the counter emf is still the same, 220 V? Or wait, that doesn't make sense because the field current has changed. Or perhaps it's assuming that the speed remains the same, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe we need to approach this differently. Since the field current is halved, the flux would be proportional to I_f, assuming linearity. So if I_f is 1 A, then the flux is half of what it was before.

But back emf E_b is proportional to flux, speed, and the number of conductors (which we can assume is constant). So if the flux is halved, and assuming the speed remains the same (which might not be accurate, but perhaps the problem is making that assumption), then E_b would be half of 220 V, so 110 V.

Wait, but is that a valid approach? Alternatively, perhaps when the field current changes, the induced back emf changes. But without knowing the motor's characteristics, it's tricky. However, the problem states that when the field is cut out, the back emf is 220 V. So perhaps when the field current is halved, the back emf is also halved.

Alternatively, maybe the speed is the same because the motor is at no load. Hmm, but no, in part (b), the motor isn't necessarily at no load anymore; we're just changing the field current.

Wait, maybe I should think about the relationship between field current and back emf. Let's denote the original field current as I_f1 = 2 A, and the new as I_f2 = 1 A. The back emf E_b is proportional to the field current (since E_b ≈ k * φ * ω, and φ is proportional to I_f). Assuming that the speed ω remains the same (which might be an assumption here), then E_b2 = E_b1 * (I_f2 / I_f1) = 220 * (1/2) = 110 V.

So now, the back emf is 110 V. Then, using E_b = V - I_a * R_a.

So I_a = (V - E_b) / R_a = (230 - 110) / 2.3 = 120 / 2.3 ≈ 52.17 amperes.

Wait, that's about 52.2 A. Looking back at the options, part (a) first value is 4.35, part (b) is 52.2. Looking for an option where (a) is ~4.35 and (b) ~52.2.

Looking at the options:

Option F: 4.35 A, 52.2 A.

Option I: 4.35, 53.2.

Hmm, but wait, my calculation for (b) gives 52.17, which is 52.2 A. So option F's second value is 52.2, which matches. So (a) is 4.35, (b) is 52.2. So the correct option would be F.

But wait, let me double-check. Because when the field current is halved, maybe the speed changes. Alternatively, perhaps the speed is determined by the back emf and the armature resistance. Wait, no, speed in a motor is determined by the back emf. So back emf is E_b = V - I_a R_a.

Wait, but if the field current is halved, the flux is halved, which affects the back emf. But without knowing the speed, perhaps the problem is assuming that the speed remains the same, leading to a proportional change in E_b. Or perhaps the motor is running at no load, so the armature current is just the one needed to maintain the back emf.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem isn't considering the change in flux and assumes that the back emf remains the same? That doesn't seem right because the field current is changed, which would change the flux and hence the back emf.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's think about the generated back emf when the field current is changed.

In a shunt motor, the back emf E_b is given by E_b = V - I_a R_a.

But when the field current changes, the flux changes, which affects the generated emf. So if the field current is halved, the flux is halved, and so is the back emf (assuming speed is the same). But then, the relationship becomes E_b2 = (I_f2 / I_f1) * E_b1.

So E_b2 = (1/2)*220 = 110 V.

Now, using E_b2 = V - I_a2 * R_a → 110 = 230 - I_a2 * 2.3 → I_a2 = (230-110)/2.3 = 120/2.3 ≈52.17 A, which is 52.2 A. So that matches part (b) of option F.

But wait, let me make sure. Because the motor's speed is determined by E_b / (flux * something), but without knowing the exact parameters, perhaps the problem expects us to proceed with the given back emf when the field is cut out, and adjust the field current, but not change the back emf. That doesn't make sense, though, because the field current affects the flux, which affects the back emf.

Alternatively, perhaps when the field current is halved, the back emf remains the same? But that's not correct because the flux would be less, leading to lower back emf. But without knowing the motor's characteristics, perhaps the problem expects us to use the same E_b as before, but I don't think that's the case.

Wait, the problem gives the back emf at no load when the field is cut out. So in part (a), it's 220 V. In part (b), the field current is halved, so the flux is halved, so the back emf at the same speed would be half, 110 V.

So then, as I calculated, I_a is about 52.2 A.

Looking back at the options, option F is (4.35,52.2), which matches. But let me check other options. Option I is (4.35,53.2), which is close but not exactly.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation for part (a). So E_b is 220 V.

I_a = (230 - 220)/2.3 = 10/2.3 ≈4.3478 A, which is approximately 4.35 A. So that's correct.

Part (b): E_b is 110 V.

I_a = (230 -110)/2.3 = 120/2.3 ≈52.1739 A, which is 52.17 A, so 52.2 A when rounded.

So the combination is 4.35 A and 52.2 A, which is option F.

Looking at the options again:

Option F: 4.35 amperes, 52.2 amperes.

Yes, that's the one.

To solve the problem, we analyze the given conditions and calculate the armature current in two scenarios:

### Part (a): Current through the armature when the field rheostat is cut out
When the field rheostat is cut out, the field current is determined by the field resistance and the supply voltage:
\[
I_f = \frac{V}{R_f} = \frac{230}{115} = 2 \, \text{A}.
\]
At no load, the counter emf (back emf) is given as \( E_b = 220 \, \text{V} \). The relationship between back emf, supply voltage, and armature current is:
\[
E_b = V - I_a R_a.
\]
Rearranging for \( I_a \):
\[
I_a = \frac{V - E_b}{R_a} = \frac{230 - 220}{2.3} = \frac{10}{2.3} \approx 4.35 \, \text{A}.
\]

### Part (b): Current through the armature when the field current is halved
When the field current is halved, \( I_f = 1 \, \text{A} \), the flux is also halved (assuming linearity). Since the back emf is proportional to the flux, the new back emf is:
\[
E_b = \frac{1}{2} \times 220 = 110 \, \text{V}.
\]
Using the same relationship as before:
\[
I_a = \frac{V - E_b}{R_a} = \frac{230 - 110}{2.3} = \frac{120}{2.3} \approx 52.17 \, \text{A}.
\]

### Final Answer
From the calculations:
- Part (a): \( I_a \approx 4.35 \, \text{A} \).
- Part (b): \( I_a \approx 52.2 \, \text{A} \).

The correct option is **F: 4.35 amperes, 52.2 amperes**.
