Okay, so I've got this question about colors and what happens when you mix red and blue light. Hmm, I remember that colors can be a bit tricky because sometimes it's about pigments and other times it's about light. Wait, right, when you're dealing with light, it's additive mixing, not subtractive like with paints or inks. So when you mix pigments, like if you mix red and blue paint, you get purple, I think. But light is different because each color is a wavelength, and when they combine, they create a new color based on what our eyes perceive.

Wait, so the question is about overlapping red and blue light. So in additive mixing, red and blue together make magenta or something like that. Wait, no, wait. Let me think. The primary colors of light are red, green, and blue. So if you mix red and blue light, you're adding their wavelengths. Red is around 700 nm, blue around 450 nm. When they overlap, the eye sees the combination as magenta. Or is it purple? I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, no, wait. In the RGB color model, which is additive, mixing red and blue gives magenta. Wait, but sometimes people say purple. Are they the same? Or is there a difference? Let me think. I think in terms of additive color, red plus blue is magenta. But when I learned about mixing in school, like with paints, red and blue make purple. But that's subtractive mixing. So for light, it's magenta. But wait, I'm not entirely sure. 

Wait, let's think about the color wheel. Red and blue are opposite each other. When you mix two primary colors in light, you get a secondary color. So red (a primary) and blue (another primary) would make... I think magenta. But wait, another way to think about it: when you have a red LED and a blue LED shining on a white surface, the spot where they overlap looks magenta to us. So the answer should be magenta, which is option C. 

Wait but wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes people refer to it as purple. Maybe in different contexts? Or maybe it's the same. Hmm. But I think in the RGB model, red plus blue is magenta. So the correct answer would be C: magenta.

When red and blue light are overlapped, the color produced is magenta. This is based on the principles of additive color mixing, where red and blue are primary colors of light. Unlike subtractive mixing with pigments (where red and blue make purple), additive mixing combines the wavelengths of red and blue light, which the human eye perceives as magenta. 

Answer: C
