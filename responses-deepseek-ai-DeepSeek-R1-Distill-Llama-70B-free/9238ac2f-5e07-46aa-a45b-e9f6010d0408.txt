Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Doppler effect with a police car siren and an echo. Hmm, I remember the Doppler effect has to do with how the observed frequency changes when there's relative motion between the source and the observer. But wait, in this case, there's an echo involved, so things might get a bit more complicated.

Let me read the problem again. The police car is moving towards a wall at 3.5 m/s. The speed of sound is 350 m/s, and the siren's frequency is 600 Hz. The driver hears the echo, and I need to find the closest frequency from the options given.

So, the car is moving towards the wall, which means the source (the siren) is moving towards a stationary observer (the wall). But wait, the observer for the echo is the driver, who is moving with the source. So I think I need to consider both the emission of the sound and the reflection as it comes back as an echo.

Wait, the Doppler effect when the source is moving towards a stationary observer is f' = f * (v) / (v - vs), where vs is the source speed. But when the sound reflects off the wall, which is stationary, maybe the wall acts like a moving observer when the sound hits it? Or perhaps it's the car moving and the wall is stationary, so the reflection changes the observed frequency again.

Alternatively, there's a formula for when the source is moving towards a stationary observer and then the observer (the driver) is moving towards the reflected sound. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Let me think about this step by step. The siren is in the police car, which is moving towards the wall. So when the siren emits a sound wave, the car is moving, so the wavelength of the emitted sound is compressed in front of the car.

The formula for the observed frequency when the source is moving towards a stationary observer is f' = f * (v + vo) / (v - vs). Wait, wait, no—wait, when the source is moving towards the observer, the formula is f' = f * v / (v - vs), because the observer is stationary, so vo is zero. Or wait, maybe I should get the formulas straight.

Wait, the general Doppler effect formula is f_observed = f_source * (v + vo) / (v - vs), where vo is the observer's speed towards the source, and vs is the source's speed towards the observer. So in the case where the source is moving towards the observer, vs is positive. If the observer is moving towards the source, vo is positive.

But in this problem, the source (siren) is moving towards the wall (which is acting as a reflector). So the sound emitted toward the wall has a higher frequency due to the source moving towards it. Then, the wall reflects the sound, and the driver in the moving car hears it.

Wait, so the wall is stationary, so when the sound hits the wall, the reflection would be similar to when the source is moving. But wait, in this case, the wall is just reflecting; it's not moving. So perhaps the sound that comes back is affected by the driver moving towards it.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the frequency of the sound as it hits the wall, then calculate the frequency as it comes back to the moving observer.

But wait, when the car emits the sound, the frequency observed by the wall would be higher because the source is moving towards it. Then, when the sound reflects off the wall and comes back, the observer (driver) is moving towards the oncoming sound wave, so another Doppler shift occurs.

So, first, calculate the frequency of the sound as it reaches the wall. Then, calculate the frequency as it comes back to the driver.

Let me break it down:

1. Source (siren) moving towards a stationary observer (wall). So the frequency at the wall is f1 = f * (v) / (v - vs).

Here, v is speed of sound, 350 m/s; vs is the source speed, 3.5 m/s towards the wall.

So f1 = 600 * 350 / (350 - 3.5) = 600 * 350 / 346.5.

Calculating that denominator: 350 -3.5 = 346.5.

So 350/346.5 = approximately 1.0106.

So f1 ≈ 600 * 1.0106 ≈ 606.36 Hz.

So the sound reaching the wall is about 606.36 Hz.

Then, this sound reflects off the wall and travels back to the driver. Now, the driver is moving towards the wall at 3.5 m/s, so relative to the sound wave coming back, the driver is moving towards it.

In this case, the sound source is the wall, which is stationary. So the observer (driver) is moving towards the source (the wall), which is stationary. So the formula for the frequency observed (f2) is f2 = f1 * (v + vo) / v.

Here, vo is the observer's speed towards the source, which is 3.5 m/s.

So f2 = 606.36 Hz * (350 + 3.5) / 350.

Wait, wait: Wait, no, because when the observer is moving towards the source, the formula is f_observed = f_source * (v + vo) / v.

Wait, but wait, the source is the wall, which is stationary. So for the second part of the journey, the sound wave is coming from a stationary source (the wall) towards the moving observer (driver moving towards the wall). So the formula is f2 = f1 * (v + vo) / (v), since the source is stationary (vs=0), so denominator is v. But wait, the source is the wall, so when the sound is coming back, the source (wall) is stationary, and the observer (driver) is moving towards it.

Hmm, perhaps I should clarify the formula again.

The standard Doppler effect formula is:

f_observed = f_source * (v + vo) / (v - vs)

Where:

- v is the speed of sound in the medium (350 m/s here).
- vo is the speed of the observer towards the source (positive if moving towards, negative if moving away).
- vs is the speed of the source towards the observer (positive if moving towards, negative if moving away).

In the first case, the source (siren) is moving towards the wall (observer). So vs = +3.5 m/s, vo=0 (wall is stationary). So f1 = 600 * (350) / (350 - 3.5) ≈ 606.36 Hz.

In the second case, the wall is the source, which is stationary, so vs=0. The observer (driver) is moving towards the wall (source), so vo=+3.5 m/s. Thus:

f2 = f1 * (v + vo) / (v - vs) => since vs=0, denominator is v.

So f2 = 606.36 * (350 + 3.5) / 350.

Compute numerator: 350 + 3.5 = 353.5.

So 353.5 / 350 = 1.0100.

So f2 ≈ 606.36 * 1.0100 ≈ 612.36 Hz.

Wait, but wait a minute—that would make the observed frequency about 612 Hz, which is option F.

But looking at the options, option F is 612 Hz. So is that correct?

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake in the first step.

Wait, let me recalculate the first step more accurately.

f1 = 600 * 350 / (350 - 3.5) = 600 * 350 / 346.5.

Compute 350 / 346.5: 346.5 is 350 minus 3.5.

Let me compute 350 divided by 346.5.

346.5 = 350*(1 - 0.01) approximately. Hmm, but exact calculation:

346.5 * 1.0106 = 350? Let me check: 346.5 * 1.01 = 346.5 + 3.465= 349.965, which is close to 350. So 350/346.5 ≈ 1.0106.

So 600 * 1.0106 = 606.36 Hz.

Second step: f2 = 606.36 * (350 +3.5)/350.

Compute (350 +3.5)=353.5.

353.5/350 = 1.01.

So 606.36 * 1.01 = ?

606.36 * 1.01 = 606.36 + 6.0636 = 612.4236 Hz.

So approximately 612.42 Hz.

Looking at the options, F is 612 Hz, which is very close. So the answer should be F.

But wait, wait a minute: Another way to think about this is using the approaching and receding correctly. Because when the car is moving towards the wall, it emits higher frequency, and when the echo comes back, the car is moving towards the echo, so it perceives a higher frequency than the emitted one.

Wait, but in this calculation, the first step increases the frequency to 606 Hz, then the second step increases it further to 612 Hz.

But wait, is there a simpler way to model the Doppler effect for a moving source and moving observer in the case of an echo?

Wait, another approach is to model the total effect when the source is moving towards a stationary reflector, and then the observer is moving towards the reflected wave.

I remember that when both source and observer are moving, the combined effect can be considered. But I think the way I approached it step by step is correct.

Alternatively, I've heard that when dealing with echoes, the total Doppler shift can be approximated as the product of the two individual shifts. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the overall formula when the source is moving towards a stationary wall and the observer is moving towards the wall (and the echo) can be found as:

f_observed = f_source * (v + vo) / (v - vs) * (v + vo) / (v + vs)?

No, that doesn't sound right.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model each leg of the journey separately. So first, the source emits a wave that travels to the wall, which is moving towards it. Then, the wave bounces back, and the observer (driver) moving towards the wall receives it.

So first Doppler shift when the source moves towards the wall:

f1 = f * (v) / (v - vs) = 600 * 350/(350-3.5) ≈ 606.36 Hz.

Then, the wave comes back, and the observer is moving towards it. So the Doppler shift is:

f2 = f1 * (v + vo) / (v) because the source (wall) is stationary.

So f2 = 606.36 * (350 + 3.5) / 350 ≈ 606.36 * 353.5/350 ≈ 606.36 * 1.01 ≈ 612.42 Hz.

So this matches the previous calculation.

Looking at the options, 612 Hz is option F.

But wait, let me check the options again. The options are:

A: 594 Hz

B: 588 Hz

C: 606 Hz

D: 642 Hz

E: 636 Hz

F: 612 Hz

G: 600 Hz

H: 618 Hz

I: 630 Hz

J: 624 Hz

So F is 612 Hz, which is what I calculated. So that's the closest.

Wait, but wait another thought: Sometimes when both the source and observer are moving towards each other, the formula is f = f0 (v + vo) / (v - vs). But in this case, the source (siren) is moving towards the wall, and the observer (driver) is moving towards the echo. Wait, perhaps I should model the entire situation as the source moving and the observer moving.

Alternatively, perhaps the driver is the observer moving towards the oncoming echo, and the echo's source (the wall) is stationary.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. My initial approach seems correct: first calculate the frequency at the wall due to the moving source, then calculate the frequency heard by the moving observer from the stationary wall.

So yes, the final frequency is approximately 612 Hz.
</think>

The problem involves the Doppler effect with a police car siren and an echo. The car is moving towards a stationary wall at 3.5 m/s, the speed of sound is 350 m/s, and the siren's frequency is 600 Hz. The goal is to determine the frequency of the echo heard by the driver.

### Key Analysis:
1. **First Doppler Shift (Source moving towards the wall):**  
   The siren (source) is moving towards the wall (stationary observer). The formula for the observed frequency is:  
   \[
   f_1 = f \cdot \frac{v}{v - v_s}
   \]  
   where \(v = 350 \, \text{m/s}\), \(v_s = 3.5 \, \text{m/s}\), and \(f = 600 \, \text{Hz}\).  
   Substituting values:  
   \[
   f_1 = 600 \cdot \frac{350}{350 - 3.5} = 600 \cdot \frac{350}{346.5} \approx 606.36 \, \text{Hz}.
   \]  
   The frequency of the sound reaching the wall is approximately \(606.36 \, \text{Hz}\).

2. **Second Doppler Shift (Echo returning to the moving observer):**  
   The sound reflects off the wall and travels back to the driver, who is moving towards the wall at \(3.5 \, \text{m/s}\). The formula for the observed frequency is:  
   \[
   f_2 = f_1 \cdot \frac{v + v_o}{v}
   \]  
   where \(v_o = 3.5 \, \text{m/s}\). Substituting values:  
   \[
   f_2 = 606.36 \cdot \frac{350 + 3.5}{350} = 606.36 \cdot \frac{353.5}{350} \approx 606.36 \cdot 1.01 \approx 612.42 \, \text{Hz}.
   \]  
   The frequency of the echo heard by the driver is approximately \(612.42 \, \text{Hz}\).

3. **Comparison with Options:**  
   The closest frequency to \(612.42 \, \text{Hz}\) among the given options is \(612 \, \text{Hz}\), which corresponds to option **F**.

### Conclusion:
The frequency of the echo heard by the driver is approximately \(612 \, \text{Hz}\).
