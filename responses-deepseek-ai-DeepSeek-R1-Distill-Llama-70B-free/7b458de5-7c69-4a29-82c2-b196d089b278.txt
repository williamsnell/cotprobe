Okay, so I've got this question about the density of cell membranes. Hmm, I remember that cell membranes are mostly made of proteins and phospholipids. Oh wait, the question says 60% protein and 40% phosphoglycerides. Right, phosphoglycerides are another term for phospholipids, I think.

So part (a) asks me to calculate the average density of the membrane. I remember that density is mass per unit volume. But wait, how do I calculate the average when there are two components? Oh right, I think it's a weighted average based on their percentages.

The protein is 60% and has a density of 1.2 g/cm³. Phosphoglycerides are 40% with a density of 0.92 g/cm³. So I should calculate each component's contribution and add them up.

Wait, but wait a second. Is this by mass or by volume? Because percentages can be tricky here. Oh wait, the question doesn't specify whether it's by mass or volume. Hmm. Oh, wait, the question says "most membranes contain about 60% protein and 40% phosphoglycerides." I think in biological contexts, when they give percentages like this without specifying, it's usually by mass. Or wait, could it be by volume? No, I think it's by mass. Or wait, no, wait: wait, the composition of the membrane is given as 60% protein and 40% lipid by mass, I believe. Because proteins are more dense, but lipids occupy more volume perhaps.

But for calculating average density, I think the approach is to find the mass-weighted average or volume-weighted? Wait, no, another approach is to assume that the volumes are additive and find the total mass over total volume.

Wait, maybe I should model this. Let's say I have a certain mass of each component. Let's pick a mass for each to simplify. Let's say the total mass is 100 grams. So 60 grams protein and 40 grams phosphoglycerides.

Wait, but then their volumes would be mass divided by density. So volume of protein is 60 g / 1.2 g/cm³. Let's calculate that: 60/1.2 is 50 cm³. And the volume of phosphoglycerides is 40 / 0.92, let's see, 40 divided by 0.92. Hmm, 40 divided by 0.92 is approximately 43.48 cm³.

So the total volume would be 50 + 43.48 = 93.48 cm³, and the total mass is 100 grams. So the average density is total mass divided by total volume.

So 100 g / 93.48 cm³. Let's compute that. 100 / 93.48 is approximately 1.07 g/cm³. Wait, 93.48 is about 93.5, so 100 divided by 93.5 is roughly 1.069. So around 1.07 g/cm³.

But wait, looking at the options, I see options with 1.06, 1.08, 1.05, etc. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the volumes more accurately. For proteins: 60 g / 1.2 g/cm³. 60 / 1.2 is 50 cm³. That's correct.

Phosphoglycerides: 40 g / 0.92 g/cm³. Let's compute 40 divided by 0.92. 0.92 times 43 is 39.56, which is close to 40. So 40 / 0.92 is 43.47826... So approximately 43.48 cm³.

Total volume is 50 + 43.48 = 93.48 cm³. Total mass is 60 +40=100 grams.

Density is 100 /93.48 = approximately 1.069 g/cm³. So about 1.07. But none of the options exactly match that. Let's look at the options again.

Options for part (a):

Option A: 1.06

Option E:1.03

Option F:1.09

Option H:1.08

Option I:1.2

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe the percentages are by volume, not by mass. Let me think again. The question says "about 60% protein and 40% phosphoglycerides." I'm not sure if that's by mass or volume. In many biological contexts, percentages of components in a mixture like a membrane are given by mass. But perhaps the question assumes that the 60% and 40% are by volume, which complicates things.

Wait, that's a possibility. If the percentages are by volume, then the calculation would be different. Let me try that approach.

If 60% by volume is protein and 40% by volume is phosphoglyceride.

Let's say total volume is V. So protein volume is 0.6 V, phospho is 0.4 V.

Then mass of protein is 0.6 V * 1.2 g/cm³.

Mass of phospho is 0.4 V * 0.92 g/cm³.

Total mass is (0.6 *1.2 + 0.4 *0.92) * V.

Compute 0.6 *1.2 = 0.72, 0.4 *0.92=0.368. Sum is 1.088. So total mass is 1.088 V.

Density is mass/volume = 1.088 V / V = 1.088 g/cm³, which is around 1.09.

But that doesn't match the initial assumption of 1.07. Hmm. So the first approach gave me 1.07, the second approach 1.09.

Wait, but the question says "60% protein and 40% phosphoglycerides." If it's by mass, like 60% of the mass is protein, then my first approach is correct.

So back to the first approach, which gave me approximately 1.07. Looking at the options, the closest is option F:1.09, E:1.03, A:1.06, H:1.08.

Wait, none of the options exactly match 1.07. So maybe I need to compute more accurately.

Calculating 100 grams divided by 93.48 cm³.

Let me compute 100 / 93.48:

93.48 × 1 = 93.48 → 100-93.48=6.52 left.

Bring down a zero: 65.2. 93.48 × 0.069 → 93.48 *0.06 is 5.6088, 93.48 *0.009=0.8403. So 5.6088 +0.8403=6.4491.

So 0.069 → 93.48 *0.069 = 6.4491. Subtract from 6.52 gives 0.0709 left.

Bring down another zero: 0.709.

93.48 × 0.0007 is about 0.0654. So 0.07 would be about 0.0654, which leaves 0.709-654=55 (but wait, I'm getting a bit confused here). Alternatively, perhaps it's better to use a calculator approach.

Wait, 100 ÷ 93.48 = approximately 1.0699, which is about 1.07 g/cm³.

Looking at the options, the closest is option F:1.09, but that's higher. Option E is 1.03, which is lower. Option A is 1.06, which is 0.01 lower than 1.07. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the problem. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the calculation should be done differently. Let me try another approach: calculating the average density as the sum of the fractions multiplied by their densities.

But wait, that's only correct if the fractions are by volume. Because if the fraction is the volume, then the average density is (f1*d1 + f2*d2). But if the fractions are by mass, then you have to compute it differently, as I did earlier.

So the confusion arises from whether the 60% is by mass or by volume.

The question says the membrane contains about 60% protein and 40% phosphoglycerides. I think in biochemistry, when such percentages are given for membrane composition, it's by mass. For example, the fluid mosaic model describes the membrane as about 50% protein and 50% lipid by mass. So in this question, it's 60-40.

But to be precise, let me consider both cases.

Case 1: percentage by mass.

Compute average density as (mass_protein * density_protein + mass_phospho * density_phospho) / (volume_protein + volume_phospho).

Wait, another way: (m1 d1 + m2 d2) / (m1/d1 + m2/d2). Because m1= mass_protein = 60, m2=40.

So average density = (60*1.2 +40*0.92) / (60/1.2 +40/0.92).

Calculate numerator: 60*1.2=72, 40*0.92=36.8 → total 108.8.

Denominator: 60/1.2=50, 40/0.92=43.478 → 93.478.

So 108.8 /93.478 ≈ 1.164 g/cm³? Wait, wait, that can't be right because earlier I thought it was around 1.07.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, wait a second, that approach isn't correct. Because if I have 60% by mass protein, the total mass is 100 grams. So the average density is (total mass) / (total volume) = 100 g / 93.478 cm³ ≈ 1.069 g/cm³, as I calculated before.

So the correct approach is mass-based. So the average density is about 1.07 g/cm³.

Looking again at the options, the closest one is option E: 1.03, which is lower. Option A: 1.06, which is 0.01 less than 1.07. Hmmm, but perhaps I should check if I made an error in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value. Let's calculate the denominator more precisely.

Total volume = (60/1.2) + (40/0.92) = 50 + (40/0.92).

40 divided by 0.92: 40/0.92 = 43.47826087 cm³.

So total volume = 50 + 43.47826087 = 93.47826087 cm³.

Total mass is 100 grams.

Density = 100 /93.47826087 = let's compute this.

Well, 93.478 * 1.07 → 93.478 *1=93.478, 93.478 *0.07=6.54346 → total 100.02146. Oh wait, that's over 100.

So 93.478 * 1.07 = approx 100.02, which is just over 100. So 93.478 * 1.0699 ≈ 100.

So 100 / 93.478 is approximately 1.0699 → ~1.07.

But none of the options match exactly. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 1.06

B:0.92

C:1.05

D:0.99

E:1.03

F:1.09

G:1.15

H:1.08

I:1.2

J:1.00

Hmm, the closest is option F:1.09, but that's higher than 1.07. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Alternatively, maybe the question uses volume percentages.

Wait, if the percentages are by volume, then the average density is (0.6*1.2) + (0.4*0.92) = 0.72 + 0.368= 1.088 g/cm³, which is about 1.09. Which would correspond to option F:1.09.

Wait, so if the question's 60% and 40% are by volume, then the average density is 1.088, which is option F:1.09.

But earlier, I thought it's by mass, but perhaps the question states the composition in terms of volume? I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the question says that the membrane contains about 60% protein and 40% phosphoglycerides. If that's by mass, then the average density is ~1.07, but if it's by volume, then it's ~1.09.

Given the options, 1.09 is an option (F) but 1.07 isn't. So perhaps the question considers the percentages as by volume.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach, and the correct way is to compute the average as (0.6 *1.2) + (0.4 *0.92) = 1.088, which is 1.09.

But wait, that approach would be correct only if the 60% and 40% are by volume. Because if they're by mass, you can't just add the percentages times density.

So I'm stuck between two possibilities.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the mistake is in the assumption that the percentages are by mass. Maybe in reality, the average density is calculated as the sum of the volume contributions.

Wait, but no, that doesn't make sense. The correct way to find average density when given mass percentages is to compute (sum m_i * d_i) / sum (m_i / d_i).

Wait, perhaps I should look for the formula. The formula for average density when components are given in mass percentages is:

Average density = (mass_fraction_protein * density_protein + mass_fraction_phospho * density_phospho) / ( (mass_fraction_protein / density_protein) + (mass_fraction_phospho / density_phospho) ) 

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me think again. Suppose you have a mixture of two substances with mass fractions w1 and w2 (w1 + w2 =1), and densities d1 and d2.

The total mass is M = w1*M_total + w2*M_total.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of total mass M = m1 + m2.

m1 = w1 * M, m2 = w2 * M.

The volume V = m1/d1 + m2/d2.

So average density d_avg = M / V.

Which is d_avg = (w1 M + w2 M) / ( (w1 M /d1 ) + (w2 M /d2) ) )

The M cancels out, so:

d_avg = (w1 + w2) / ( (w1 /d1 ) + (w2 /d2) )

Since w1 +w2 =1, it's 1 / (w1/d1 + w2/d2 )

Wait, that's correct. So the formula is 1 divided by (w1/d1 + w2/d2), where w1 and w2 are mass fractions.

So in this case, w1=0.6, w2=0.4.

d1=1.2, d2=0.92.

So d_avg = 1 / (0.6/1.2 + 0.4/0.92 )

Compute denominator:

0.6 /1.2 = 0.5.

0.4 /0.92 = approx 0.4347826.

Sum = 0.5 + 0.4347826 = 0.9347826.

So d_avg = 1 / 0.9347826 ≈ 1.0697 g/cm³, which is about 1.07.

So this confirms the earlier calculation of approximately 1.07 g/cm³.

But the options don't have 1.07. So I'm a bit confused. Unless I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me compute 1 / (0.6/1.2 + 0.4/0.92) more accurately.

Compute each part:

0.6 /1.2 = 0.5 exactly.

0.4 /0.92: let's compute this.

0.92 × 0.4347826 = 0.4.

So 0.4 /0.92 = 0.4347826087.

So sum is 0.5 + 0.4347826087 = 0.9347826087.

d_avg = 1 / 0.9347826087 = ?

Let me compute this division accurately.

1 / 0.9347826087.

Compute 0.9347826087 × 1.07 = ?

0.9347826087 ×1 =0.9347826087.

0.9347826087 ×0.07= 0.0654348826.

Sum: ~0.9347826 + 0.06543488= 1.0002175. Oh, so 0.9347826 ×1.07≈1.0002175, which is just over 1. So 1/0.9347826 is approximately 1.0699, which is 1.07.

So the average density is approximately 1.07 g/cm³.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A:1.06 and option H:1.08.

Wait, none of the options match exactly. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should check if I made a mistake in the mass fractions. Oh wait, the question says 60% protein and 40% phosphoglycerides. So the mass fractions are 0.6 and 0.4, correct.

Hmm, then perhaps the intended approach in the question is to calculate a weighted average based on volume fractions, which would give a different result.

Alternatively, perhaps the question considers the percentages as volume percentages. Let me try that.

If it's 60% by volume protein and 40% by volume phosphoglycerides.

Then, the average density is (0.6 *1.2) + (0.4 *0.92) = 0.72 + 0.368=1.088 g/cm³, which is about 1.09.

Which is option F:1.09 g/cm³.

But the question says the membrane contains about 60% protein and 40% phosphoglycerides, which I think is by mass, not volume.

So this is a bit confusing. But in the absence of the exact value in the options, perhaps I should look again.

Wait
