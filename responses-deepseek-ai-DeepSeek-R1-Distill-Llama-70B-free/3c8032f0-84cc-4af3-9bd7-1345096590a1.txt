Question:

A marine research facility uses a towing basin to test models of proposed ship hull configurations. A new hull shape utilizing a bulbous underwater bow is proposed for a nuclear- powered aircraft carrier that is to be 300 m long. A 3-m model has been tested in the towing tank and found to have a maximum practical hull speed of 1.4 m/s. What is the anticipated hull speed for the prototype?

Options:

A: 18 m/s
B: 20 m/s
C: 12 m/s
D: 14 m/s
E: 10 m/s
F: 25 m/s
G: 30 m/s
H: 1.4 m/s
I: 7 m/s
J: 8.5 m/s

Okay, so I've got this problem about scaling the speed of a ship model to the actual prototype. Hmm, I remember that when models are tested, their performance is scaled up using certain laws. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details, but I think it has to do with the principle of similarity, maybe Froude scaling?

Wait, the question is about a towing tank test. Oh right, in naval architecture, when they test models, they often use Froude's law of similarity because it's about resistance and scaling in water. Froude's law relates the speed of the model and the prototype based on their lengths. Let me think about the formula.

I recall that the formula is V_p = V_m * (L_p / L_m)^(1/2), but wait is that Froude or Reynolds scaling? Oh right, Froude's law deals with the ratio of inertial forces to gravitational forces, so it's used for situations where waves are important, like in towing tanks. Reynolds number is more about viscosity, which is probably not the case here.

So the model is 3 meters long, and the prototype is 300 meters. That's a scale factor of 100. So the length ratio L_p/L_m is 100. The model speed is 1.4 m/s.

Wait, but Froude's law says that the Froude number (Fn) must be the same for both model and prototype. Fn is V / sqrt(gL). So Fn_p = Fn_m.

So V_p / sqrt(g L_p) = V_m / sqrt(g L_m). The g cancels out. So V_p = V_m * sqrt(L_p / L_m).

Ah, so if the prototype is 100 times longer, the speed should be sqrt(100) times the model speed. That's 10 times.

So V_p = 1.4 m/s * 10 = 14 m/s. Let me look at the options. Option D is 14 m/s. That's probably the answer.

Wait, but wait! Some might think it's a linear scale, but no, it's the square root because of the Froude scaling. So 3m model to 300m gives a length ratio of 100, sqrt(100) is 10. So 1.4 *10 is 14. So D is correct.

The problem involves scaling the speed of a ship model to the prototype using Froude's law of similarity. Froude's law states that the Froude number (Fn), defined as \( Fn = \frac{V}{\sqrt{gL}} \), must remain constant between the model and prototype. This leads to the relationship:

\[
V_p = V_m \cdot \sqrt{\frac{L_p}{L_m}}
\]

Here:
- \( V_p \) is the prototype speed,
- \( V_m \) is the model speed,
- \( L_p \) is the prototype length,
- \( L_m \) is the model length.

Given:
- \( V_m = 1.4 \, \text{m/s} \),
- \( L_p = 300 \, \text{m} \),
- \( L_m = 3 \, \text{m} \),

the length ratio is \( \frac{L_p}{L_m} = 100 \), and its square root is \( \sqrt{100} = 10 \). Thus:

\[
V_p = 1.4 \cdot 10 = 14 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

From the options provided, the correct answer is **D: 14 m/s**.
