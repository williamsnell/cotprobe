Okay, so I have this logic problem to solve, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. The question is about translating an English sentence into predicate logic. The sentence given is "Leo is taller than Cathy." The options provided are from A to J, each with different combinations of symbols.

First, I need to understand the components of the sentence. The subject is "Leo," the predicate is "is taller than," and the object is "Cathy." In predicate logic, we usually represent this with a predicate symbol followed by the subject and object as arguments.

The problem gives me the abbreviations: c stands for Cathy, l stands for Leo, and Txy means "x is taller than y." So, the predicate here is T, and it's a binary predicate because it takes two arguments.

Breaking it down, "Leo is taller than Cathy" translates to T(l, c). That's because Leo is the subject (x) and Cathy is the object (y). So, x is Leo, and y is Cathy.

Now, looking at the options, I need to see which one matches T(l, c). Let's go through the options one by one:

Option A: TlcL – Hmm, this looks like T followed by three letters. Maybe TlcL is T(l, c, L), but that doesn't make sense because T is a binary predicate needing only two arguments. So this might not be right.

Option B: cTL – That would translate to T(L, c), but the order here is c T L. Wait, no, the way it's written, it's c T L, which would be T(L, c), but I'm not sure if the order matters here. Wait, no, in the standard notation, it's Txy where x is the first argument and y the second. So T(l, c) is correct. Option B is cTL, which would be T(L, c) if it's T followed by L and c. But I'm not sure if the way the options are written matters in terms of order.

Option C: lTc – This looks like T(l, c), which is exactly what I'm looking for. So this might be the correct option.

Option D: Tll – This would mean T(l, l), which would be Leo is taller than himself, which doesn't make sense in this context.

Option E: cTl – This would be T(c, l), meaning Cathy is taller than Leo, which is the opposite of the original statement.

Option F: TclC – Not sure what this stands for. It might be T(c, l, C), but again, T is binary, so this would be incorrect.

Option G: Tlc – Wait, Tlc would be T(l, c), which matches what I need. So option G is Tlc, which is the same as T(l, c). So both option C and G seem to be possibilities, but wait, let me check how the options are written.

Wait, the question says the options are A through J, each being a possible expression. So option C is lTc, which is written as l followed by T followed by c. In predicate logic, the standard form is T(l, c), which would correspond to Tlc. So option G is Tlc, which is the correct notation.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because option C is lTc, which would be l T c. Does that translate to T(l, c)? Or is the order important? In predicate logic, the order is crucial because Txy is x taller than y. So T(l, c) is correct, which would be written as Tlc. So option G is Tlc, which is correct.

Wait, but let me double-check. Option C is lTc, which would mean l is the first argument, c the second, so T(l, c). So that's the same as option G. Wait, no—option G is Tlc, which is T followed by l and c. Option C is lTc, which is l followed by T followed by c. So in terms of notation, the predicate symbol comes first, followed by the arguments. So the correct form should be T(l, c), which is option G: Tcl (assuming the letters are lower case). Wait, no—the options list G as Tlc. Oh, because l and c are lower case letters representing constants.

Wait, in the problem statement, the options are given as strings, so I need to see how they're written. The question lists the options as, for example, option C: lTc. So that would be l T c, which is the same as T(l, c). But in standard predicate logic, the predicate comes first, then the arguments. So the correct answer should be T(l, c), which would be written as Tlc, which is option G.

But wait, looking back, option C is lTc, which would be T(l, c) if the order is subject-predicate-object. But in predicate logic, it's predicate(subject, object). So the correct way is T(l, c), which is option G: Tlc.

So the correct answer should be option G.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me look at the options again carefully.

The options are:

A: TlcL

B: cTL

C: lTc

D: Tll

E: cTl

F: TclC

G: Tlc

H: Tcl

I: Tcc

J: lCT

So option G is Tlc, which is T(l, c). Option C is lTc, which would be l as the first argument, then T, then c as the second. But in logic, the predicate comes first, so T(l, c) is correct, which is option G. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes in logic, the notation can vary, but typically, the predicate is first. So I think option G is correct.

The question requires translating the English sentence "Leo is taller than Cathy" into predicate logic. The given symbols are: c for Cathy, l for Leo, and Txy for "x is taller than y." In predicate logic, the standard form is to place the predicate first, followed by the arguments in order. Therefore, "Leo is taller than Cathy" translates to T(l, c), which corresponds to the option written as Tlc.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A (TlcL):** Incorrect, as it includes an extra argument (L), making it a ternary predicate, which is not applicable here.
- **Option B (cTL):** Incorrect, as it implies T(L, c), but the order of arguments does not match the standard predicate logic notation.
- **Option C (lTc):** While this represents T(l, c), it places the predicate (T) in the middle, which is non-standard in predicate logic.
- **Option D (Tll):** Incorrect, as it implies Leo is taller than himself, which is nonsensical in this context.
- **Option E (cTl):** Incorrect, as it implies Cathy is taller than Leo, which is the opposite of the original statement.
- **Option F (TclC):** Incorrect, as it includes an extra argument (C), making it a ternary predicate.
- **Option G (Tlc):** Correct, as it matches the standard predicate logic notation T(l, c), where the predicate comes first, followed by the arguments.
- **Option H (Tcl):** Incorrect, as it likely represents T(c, l), meaning Cathy is taller than Leo, which is the opposite of the original statement.
- **Option I (Tcc):** Incorrect, as it implies Cathy is taller than herself, which is nonsensical.
- **Option J (lCT):** Incorrect, as it does not follow the standard predicate logic notation.

The correct translation is T(l, c), which corresponds to **Option G: Tlc**.

Answer: G
