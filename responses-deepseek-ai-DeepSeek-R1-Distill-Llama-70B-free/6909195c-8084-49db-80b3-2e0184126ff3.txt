Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Pat Shelley's advice on retirement. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking, according to Pat Shelley's Senior View, under what condition shouldn't you retire. The options are from A to J. I need to figure out the correct answer.

First, I'll try to remember what Pat Shelley said. From what I recall, Pat Shelley is a senior who probably has some experience and insights on retirement. The key point is that she advises against retiring if a certain condition is met.

Looking at the options, I'll go through each one:

A: You haven't reached your career goals. That makes sense because if you haven't achieved what you wanted in your career, retiring might make you feel unfulfilled. But I'm not sure if that's exactly what Pat Shelley said.

B: Your health doesn't allow you to retire. Wait, if your health doesn't allow retirement, does that mean you shouldn't retire? Or maybe the opposite. Actually, if health is bad, maybe you should retire to focus on it. Hmm, not sure.

C: You have no hobbies. That seems relevant because without hobbies, retirement might lead to boredom or lack of purpose. But I'm not certain if that's the exact reason Pat gave.

D: You're younger than 65. I think 65 is a common retirement age, but maybe she thinks you shouldn't retire if you're younger than that. Or maybe it's the opposite.

E: You can't do it right. Not sure what that means. Maybe if you can't manage retirement properly, you shouldn't retire.

F: You don't have a retirement plan in place. That sounds logical. Without a plan, retiring could lead to financial issues. But I'm not sure if that was her point.

G: You're younger than 60. Similar to D, but 60 is even younger than 65. Maybe she suggests not retiring until you're at least 60 or 65.

H: You still enjoy your work. Oh, this seems likely. If you still enjoy your job, why retire? She might advise against retiring if you're happy in your career.

I: You have debt to pay off. That makes sense. Retiring with debt could be problematic, so perhaps she says not to retire in that case.

J: Your family wants you to keep working. That's a possibility, but I'm not sure if she focused on family pressure.

Wait, I think Pat Shelley's main point was about enjoying your work. She probably said not to retire if you still enjoy what you're doing because it gives you purpose and fulfillment. So the answer would be H.

The correct answer is H: You still enjoy your work. Pat Shelley likely advised against retiring if one still enjoys their job, as it provides fulfillment and purpose.

Answer: H
