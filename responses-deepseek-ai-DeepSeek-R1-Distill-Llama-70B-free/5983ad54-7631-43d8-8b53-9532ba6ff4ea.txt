Question:

A large city was interested in annexing part of the surrounding county. In a survey conducted by the local newspaper, 58 percent of respondents said they were against the annexation. During the actual vote, not all eligible voters voted, but 56 percent of the respondents voted against the annexation. Which of the following best describes the difference in the percentages obtained from the newspaper poll and the vote itself?

Options:

A: It is the difference caused by the undercoverage of certain groups in the population.
B: It is the difference between the statistic and the truth due to use of a random sample.
C: It is the systematic difference between a statistic and parameter caused by a biased question.
D: It is an example of response bias, the systematic tendency of individuals with particular characteristics to respond to a survey question in a certain way.
E: It is the difference caused by the overrepresentation of certain groups in the population.
F: It is the difference between the same statistics computed from two identical samples.
G: It is the systematic difference between a statistic and parameter caused by the nonrandom selection of surveyed persons.
H: It is the difference between the same statistics computed from two different samples.
I: It is an example of nonresponse bias, the systematic tendency of individuals with particular characteristics to refuse to answer a survey question.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about statistics and surveys. Hmm, let me read it carefully.

The question says that a city wanted to annex part of the surrounding county. A newspaper survey found that 58% of respondents were against it. But during the actual vote, 56% voted against. The question is about why there's a difference between these two percentages.

The options are from A to J, each describing a different type of statistical issue.

I remember that in statistics, there are various types of biases and errors. Like sampling error, response bias, nonresponse bias, undercoverage, etc.

So the newspaper conducted a survey, but not everyone eligible voted in the actual election. Let me think about what could cause the difference between 58% in the survey and 56% in the vote.

Wait, the survey and the vote are two different things. The survey might have asked people their opinion, but not everyone might have voted. So maybe the people who responded to the survey aren't the same as those who actually voted. Or perhaps some people didn't respond to the survey at all.

Let's look at the options. 

Option A: Undercoverage of certain groups. That means some groups weren't included in the survey. Like, if the survey didn't reach certain demographics, their opinions aren't represented. But I'm not sure if that's the main issue here.

Option B: Difference between statistic and truth due to a random sample. That sounds like sampling error, which happens when a random sample doesn't perfectly represent the population. But the vote was a census of all eligible voters who actually voted, so maybe it's more precise. But wait, the vote itself isn't a sample; it's the actual outcome. So the survey's 58% is a sample estimate, and the vote is a population parameter. The difference could be due to sampling error, but I'm not sure if that's the best fit.

Option C: Systematic difference because of a biased question. Like the question was phrased in a way that influenced responses. But the question just says they were against annexation. No indication the question was biased. So probably not C.

Option D: Response bias, where certain people tend to respond in a particular way. I'm not sure. Response bias can happen if some groups are more likely to respond. Like, maybe people against annexation were more likely to answer the survey. But wait, in the vote, they actually voted against. So perhaps the survey included people who didn't vote. Or maybe the non-respondents in the survey would have voted differently.

Option E: Overrepresentation of certain groups. Like, if the survey had too many of a particular group, their opinions are overrepresented. But I don't see how that's directly the case here.

Option F: Difference from the same statistic in two identical samples. That would be sampling variability, but the vote wasn't a sample—it was the real thing. So probably not F.

Option G: Systematic difference due to nonrandom selection of surveyed persons. Oh, nonrandom selection would cause bias. Like, if the newspaper's survey didn't randomly select people. For example, if they only surveyed in certain areas where people are against annexation. Then their sample isn't representative, leading to a higher percentage against. But wait, the vote had 56% against, which is lower than the survey. So maybe the survey overrepresented the opposition.

Option H: Same statistics from two different samples. The survey and vote are different samples. But the vote is the actual population of voters, so maybe it's a different context. Not sure.

Option I: Nonresponse bias, where certain people refuse to answer. So if, say, people who were against annexation were more likely to respond to the survey, that would inflate the percentage against. But in the vote, since everyone who voted had their say, perhaps the non-respondents in the survey (who didn't answer) might have had different opinions. Wait, but the vote's non-respondents (those who didn't vote) aren't the same as the survey's non-respondents. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

So, the survey had 58% against, but in the actual vote, 56% were against. So the survey overestimated the opposition by 2 percentage points.

Why could that be? Maybe the people who responded to the survey were not representative of those who actually voted. For example, perhaps the survey had a higher response rate among people opposed to annexation, making the 58% higher than the true voting population's 56%. 

That would imply that the survey sample was biased—maybe certain groups were undercovered or the respondents weren't a random sample. So the systematic difference between the survey statistic and the true parameter (the vote) is because the sample wasn't randomly selected. That would point towards option G.

Alternatively, think about nonresponse bias (option I). If the people who responded to the newspaper survey were different from those who didn't respond, and those nonrespondents had different opinions. But wait, the vote's data is from actual voters, not nonrespondents of the survey. So maybe it's more about the sample being nonrandom.

Wait, the question is about the difference between the newspaper poll and the vote. The newspaper's poll is a sample, the vote is the population of voters. So if the newspaper's sample wasn't randomly selected (like if they used a method that overselected certain groups), then the statistic (58%) would be systematically different from the parameter (56% in the vote). That's a systematic difference due to nonrandom selection, which is option G.

Alternatively, another angle: the survey might have suffered from nonresponse bias. Suppose that in the survey, people who were against annexation were more likely to respond. That would make the survey results higher than the true percentage. But the vote's results are based on those who actually voted. So if some people didn't vote, perhaps their absence affected the outcome. Wait, but the vote percentage is calculated only among those who voted. The survey's percentage is among respondents, which might include people who didn't vote. But that might not directly cause the difference. 

Wait, the survey was conducted by the newspaper. Maybe the people who responded to the survey are different from the voters. For instance, perhaps the newspaper's readers are more against annexation than the general population. So the survey sample isn't representative of the voting population. That would be a problem of undercoverage (option A) or nonrandom sampling (option G). 

If the survey was not randomly selected, it's option G. So the systematic difference between the statistic (58%) and the parameter (56%) is due to the nonrandom selection of the persons surveyed. That makes sense because a nonrandom sample would have a systematic bias.

So looking at the options, option G says it's the systematic difference between a statistic and parameter caused by the nonrandom selection of surveyed persons. That sounds correct.

The question involves understanding the difference between the results of a newspaper survey (58% against annexation) and the actual vote (56% against annexation). The key issue lies in the nature of the survey and the vote. The survey is a sample of respondents, while the vote represents the actual opinions of eligible voters who chose to participate. The difference between the two percentages (58% vs. 56%) suggests a systematic discrepancy rather than random variation.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** (undercoverage of certain groups) refers to some groups being excluded from the survey. However, the question does not provide evidence that specific groups were systematically excluded.
- **Option B** (difference due to random sampling error) is unlikely because the vote is not a sample but the actual outcome, making sampling error less relevant.
- **Option C** (biased question) is not supported, as there is no indication the question was phrased to influence responses.
- **Option D** (response bias) involves systematic tendencies in how individuals respond, but the difference here is more likely due to the sample's representativeness rather than how respondents answered.
- **Option E** (overrepresentation of certain groups) could apply if the survey disproportionately included opponents of annexation, but this is not explicitly stated.
- **Option F** (same statistic from two identical samples) does not apply, as the survey and vote are fundamentally different.
- **Option G** (systematic difference due to nonrandom selection) fits well, as the survey may not have been randomly selected, leading to a sample that overrepresented opponents of annexation compared to the actual voting population.
- **Option H** (same statistic from two different samples) is incorrect because the vote is not a sample but the population of voters.
- **Option I** (nonresponse bias) refers to differences between respondents and nonrespondents in the survey, but the vote data is separate and not directly affected by survey nonresponse.

The most plausible explanation is **Option G**, as the systematic difference between the survey result (58%) and the vote result (56%) is likely due to the nonrandom selection of surveyed persons, leading to a biased sample that overrepresented opposition to annexation.
