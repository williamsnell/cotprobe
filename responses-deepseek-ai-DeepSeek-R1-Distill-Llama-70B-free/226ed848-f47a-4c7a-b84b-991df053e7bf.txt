Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question in front of me about attribution theories. Hmm, I remember that attribution theories are about how people explain events or behaviors. The question is asking about a specific theory that describes how people identify explanations of personal characteristics from behavioral evidence.

Let me think. I've studied a bit about this before. There are a few key theories I remember. The first that comes to mind is the Fundamental Attribution Error, which is the tendency to overemphasize personal characteristics and underemphasize situational factors. But wait, the question is about identifying explanations from behavior, so maybe that's not it.

Another one is the Correspondent Inference Theory. I think this is about how people infer someone's personality based on their behavior. Like, if someone does something kind, we assume they are a kind person. This seems to fit because it's about drawing conclusions about personal characteristics from specific actions.

Then there's the Covariation Model, which I associate with looking for consistency across situations. People use this to determine if a behavior is due to the person or the situation. But the question is more about personal characteristics from behavior, so maybe that's not the exact fit.

Implicit Personality Theory is about how people have implicit assumptions about how different traits go together. Like, if someone is smart, they might also be quiet. But this is more about the structure of personality beliefs, not so much about explaining behavior.

Self-Perception Theory is about how people infer their own attitudes from their behavior. Not exactly about others' characteristics.

The other options don't ring a bell as much. So putting it together, the Correspondent Inference Theory seems to be the one where people explain behavior by attributing it to the person's underlying characteristics. So the answer should be F: Correspondent Inference Theory.

The question asks about an attribution theory that explains how people identify personal characteristics from behavioral evidence. Among the options, Correspondent Inference Theory fits best, as it describes how individuals infer personality traits from specific behaviors.
