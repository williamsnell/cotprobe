Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find all the zeros of a polynomial in the finite field Z_5. The polynomial is x^5 + 3x^3 + x^2 + 2x. Hmm, Z_5 means integers modulo 5, right? So the elements are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. I think I need to plug each of these into the polynomial and see which ones make the polynomial equal to zero in Z_5.

Wait, let me think about how polynomials work in finite fields. Each coefficient is taken modulo 5, right? So the polynomial as given is already in Z_5. That makes sense.

So the strategy is to evaluate P(x) for x = 0,1,2,3,4 and see which values result in P(x) ≡ 0 mod 5.

Let me write down the polynomial for clarity: P(x) = x^5 + 3x^3 + x^2 + 2x.

I can compute P(x) for each x by substituting and simplifying each term modulo 5.

Let me start with x=0:
P(0) = 0^5 + 3*0^3 + 0^2 + 2*0 = 0. So 0 is a zero.

Next, x=1:
P(1) = 1 + 3*(1) + 1 + 2*(1) = 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 7. 7 mod 5 is 2, which isn't zero. So 1 isn't a root.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, let me recalculate that. Wait, 1^5 is 1, 3*(1)^3 is 3, 1^2 is 1, 2*1 is 2. So adding them: 1+3=4, plus 1 is 5, plus 2 is 7. So yeah, 7 mod5 is 2. So P(1)=2≠0. So 1 is not a root.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me check again. Oh wait, maybe I should compute each term mod5 as I go. Let me try that again.

x=1:
1^5 mod5 =1
3*(1^3)=3*1=3 mod5
1^2=1
2*1=2
So adding them: 1+3=4, +1=5, which is 0 mod5, then +2=2 mod5. So P(1)=2 ≠0. So 1 isn't a root.

Wait, but wait another moment. Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the polynomial structure. Let me double-check the terms. The polynomial is x^5 + 3x^3 + x^2 + 2x. So that's correct. So yeah, P(1)=2. So 1 is not a root. So 0 is a root, 1 isn't.

Now x=2:

Compute each term mod5.

x=2:

2^5: 2^2=4, 2^3=8≡3, 2^4=16≡1, 2^5=2^4 *2=1*2=2 mod5.

So 2^5 ≡ 2.

3x^3: 3*(2^3)=3*(8 mod5=3) → 3*3=9≡4 mod5.

x^2: 2^2=4.

2x: 2*2=4.

So adding all terms:

2 (from x^5) + 4 (3x^3) = 6≡1 mod5.

Then add 4 (x^2): 1+4=5≡0.

Then add 4 (2x): 0+4=4 mod5. So P(2)=4≠0. So 2 isn't a root.

Hmm, maybe I did that wrong. Let me recompute:

Wait, 2^5 is 32, which mod5 is 2 because 5*6=30, 32-30=2. Correct.

3*(2^3)=3*8=24. 24 mod5 is 4 because 5*4=20, 24-20=4.

x^2 is 4. 2x is 4.

So 2 (x^5) +4 (3x^3)=6≡1 mod5. 1 +4 (x^2)=5≡0. 0 +4 (2x)=4 mod5. So P(2)=4≠0. So 2 isn't a root.

Wait, but maybe I've made a mistake here. Let me compute each term again.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should compute each term step by step.

x=2:

x^5: 2^5 = 32 → 32 mod5= 32-5*6=32-30=2. So 2.

3x^3: 3*(2^3)=3*8=24 → 24 mod5=4.

x^2: 4.

2x:4.

So adding up all terms:

2 +4 =6 → 6 mod5=1.

1 +4=5 → 5 mod5=0.

0 +4=4 → 4 mod5=4. So P(2)=4≠0. So 2 is not a root.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute P(2) again. Alternatively, maybe I should compute each term more carefully.

Wait, another approach: since in Z_5, exponents can be reduced using Fermat's little theorem. Fermat says that for a prime p, x^(p-1) ≡1 mod p if x≠0. So for p=5, x^4≡1 mod5 if x≠0. So x^5= x^(4+1)=x^4 *x ≡1*x=x mod5. So x^5 ≡x mod5 for any x≠0.

Wait, that's a useful point. So for any x≠0 in Z_5, x^5 ≡x mod5. So that can simplify calculations.

Let me apply that.

So for x=0: x^5=0.

x=1: x^5=1.

x=2: x^5=2.

x=3: x^5=3.

x=4: x^5=4.

So I can use that to compute x^5 quickly.

So let's recompute the polynomial for each x using this.

The polynomial is x^5 +3x^3 +x^2 +2x.

So for x=0:

0 +3*0 +0 +0=0 → so 0 is a root.

x=1:

1 +3*(1)^3 +1^2 +2*1 → 1 +3 +1 +2 =7 →7 mod5=2≠0.

x=2:

2 (from x^5) +3*(2^3)=3*(8 mod5=3) → 3*3=9 mod5=4. So 2 +4=6≡1 mod5.

Then add x^2=4: 1+4=5≡0 mod5. Then add 2x=4: 0+4=4 mod5. So P(2)=4≠0.

x=3:

x^5=3. 3x^3: 3*(3^3)=3*(27 mod5=27-5*5=27-25=2 →3*2=6≡1 mod5.

x^2=9 mod5=4.

2x=6 mod5=1.

So P(3)=3 +1 +4 +1 =9 mod5=4≠0. So 3 isn't a root.

Wait, let me compute again. So 3^3 is 27, which mod5 is 2. So 3x^3 is 3*2=6≡1. So 3 +1=4.

x^2 is 3^2=9≡4. So 4 +4=8≡3.

2x is 6≡1. So 3 +1 +4 +1 = 9≡4 mod5. So not zero.

x=4:

x^5=4. 3x^3: 3*(4^3). Compute 4^3=64. 64 mod5=64-5*12=64-60=4. So 4^3≡4. So 3x^3=3*4=12≡2 mod5.

x^2=16 mod5=1.

2x=8 mod5=3.

So adding all terms:

4 (x^5) +2 (3x^3)=6≡1 mod5.

Then add x^2=1: 1+1=2.

Then add 2x=3: 2+3=5≡0 mod5. So P(4)=0. So 4 is a root.

Wait, so from x=0 to x=4, P(x) is zero for x=0 and x=4. So the zeros are 0 and 4.

Wait, but let me check all calculations again to make sure.

x=0: 0^5 +3*0^3 +0^2 +2*0=0. So yes.

x=1: 1 +3*1 +1 +2*1=1+3+1+2=7≡2≠0.

x=2: x^5=2; 3x^3=3*(8)=24≡4; x^2=4; 2x=4. So 2+4=6≡1; plus 4=5≡0; plus 4=4≡4≠0.

x=3: x^5=3; 3x^3=3*(27)=81≡1 mod5; x^2=9≡4; 2x=6≡1. So 3+1=4; +4=8≡3; +1=4≠0.

x=4: x^5=4; 3x^3=3*(64)=192 mod5... Wait, 4^3=64. 64 mod5: 5*12=60, 64-60=4. So 4^3≡4 mod5. So 3x^3=3*4=12≡2 mod5. x^2=16≡1. 2x=8≡3. So 4+2=6≡1; +1=2; +3=5≡0.

So P(4)=0. So zeros are 0 and 4.

Wait, but wait, in the options given, option F is 0,4. So that would be the answer.

But wait, the options are A:1,2; B:0,1,2,3; C:1; D:3,4; E:0,1,2; F:0,4; G:0; H:0,3; I:2,3; J:0,1.

So F is 0 and 4. So the correct answer should be F.

Wait, but in my initial calculation for x=2, I thought P(2)=4. But let me just confirm again. Let me compute P(2) using the polynomial without the x^5 optimization.

Wait, P(2)=2^5 +3*(2^3) +2^2 +2*2.

2^5=32; 3*(2^3)=3*8=24; 2^2=4; 2*2=4.

Adding all together: 32+24=56; +4=60; +4=64.

64 mod5 is 64-5*12=64-60=4. So P(2)=4 mod5. So 2 is not a root.

Thus, the zeros are 0 and 4. So option F.

To find all zeros of the polynomial \( P(x) = x^5 + 3x^3 + x^2 + 2x \) in the finite field \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \), we evaluate \( P(x) \) for each element \( x \in \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4\} \) and check if \( P(x) \equiv 0 \mod 5 \).

### Calculations:

1. **For \( x = 0 \):**
   \[
   P(0) = 0^5 + 3 \cdot 0^3 + 0^2 + 2 \cdot 0 = 0
   \]
   \( P(0) = 0 \), so \( x = 0 \) is a root.

2. **For \( x = 1 \):**
   \[
   P(1) = 1^5 + 3 \cdot 1^3 + 1^2 + 2 \cdot 1 = 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 7
   \]
   \( 7 \mod 5 = 2 \), so \( P(1) \neq 0 \). \( x = 1 \) is not a root.

3. **For \( x = 2 \):**
   \[
   P(2) = 2^5 + 3 \cdot 2^3 + 2^2 + 2 \cdot 2
   \]
   Compute each term:
   - \( 2^5 = 32 \equiv 2 \mod 5 \)
   - \( 3 \cdot 2^3 = 3 \cdot 8 = 24 \equiv 4 \mod 5 \)
   - \( 2^2 = 4 \mod 5 \)
   - \( 2 \cdot 2 = 4 \mod 5 \)

   Adding these:
   \[
   2 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 14 \equiv 4 \mod 5
   \]
   \( P(2) \neq 0 \), so \( x = 2 \) is not a root.

4. **For \( x = 3 \):**
   \[
   P(3) = 3^5 + 3 \cdot 3^3 + 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3
   \]
   Compute each term:
   - \( 3^5 = 243 \equiv 3 \mod 5 \) (using \( x^5 \equiv x \mod 5 \) for \( x \neq 0 \))
   - \( 3 \cdot 3^3 = 3 \cdot 27 = 81 \equiv 1 \mod 5 \)
   - \( 3^2 = 9 \equiv 4 \mod 5 \)
   - \( 2 \cdot 3 = 6 \equiv 1 \mod 5 \)

   Adding these:
   \[
   3 + 1 + 4 + 1 = 9 \equiv 4 \mod 5
   \]
   \( P(3) \neq 0 \), so \( x = 3 \) is not a root.

5. **For \( x = 4 \):**
   \[
   P(4) = 4^5 + 3 \cdot 4^3 + 4^2 + 2 \cdot 4
   \]
   Compute each term:
   - \( 4^5 = 1024 \equiv 4 \mod 5 \) (using \( x^5 \equiv x \mod 5 \) for \( x \neq 0 \))
   - \( 3 \cdot 4^3 = 3 \cdot 64 = 192 \equiv 2 \mod 5 \)
   - \( 4^2 = 16 \equiv 1 \mod 5 \)
   - \( 2 \cdot 4 = 8 \equiv 3 \mod 5 \)

   Adding these:
   \[
   4 + 2 + 1 + 3 = 10 \equiv 0 \mod 5
   \]
   \( P(4) = 0 \), so \( x = 4 \) is a root.

### Conclusion:
The polynomial \( P(x) \) has zeros at \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 4 \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_5 \).

### Final Answer:
The correct option is **F: 0, 4**.
