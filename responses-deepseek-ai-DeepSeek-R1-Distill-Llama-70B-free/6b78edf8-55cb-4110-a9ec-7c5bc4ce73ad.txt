Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm a bit nervous because stoichiometry has always been a bit tricky for me. But I'll take it step by step.

The problem is about recovering sulfur from waste gases, specifically H2S and SO2. The reaction given is 2H2S + SO2 → 3S + 2H2O. The question is asking how much sulfur can be recovered if 650,000 kg of SO2 are deposited into the air. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Alright, first, I should probably write down the reaction to get a clear picture. The balanced equation is already given, so that's a plus. Let me see: 2 moles of H2S react with 1 mole of SO2 to produce 3 moles of S and 2 moles of H2O.

Wait, but in this case, we have 650,000 kg of SO2. So the question is about how much S we can get from that. Since the reaction uses SO2 to produce S, I need to find the mole ratio between SO2 and S, and then convert that into kilograms.

Let me outline the steps I think I should take:

1. Convert the mass of SO2 to moles. For that, I need the molar mass of SO2.
2. Use the mole ratio from the balanced equation to find out how many moles of S are produced per mole of SO2.
3. Convert the moles of S to kilograms using the molar mass of S.

Okay, let's get into the details.

First, molar masses. SO2 is sulfur dioxide. Sulfur's atomic weight is about 32.07 g/mol, and oxygen is 16.00 g/mol. So SO2 has (32.07) + 2*(16.00) = 32.07 + 32 = 64.07 g/mol.

So, mass of SO2 is 650,000 kg. Oh wait, that's in kg. I should convert that to grams because molar masses are in grams. So 650,000 kg = 650,000 * 1000 = 650,000,000 grams.

Moles of SO2 = mass / molar mass = 650,000,000 g / 64.07 g/mol ≈ let's calculate that.

Hmm, 64 times 10 million is 640 million. 650 million is 10 million more, so 10,156,250 moles approximately. Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 64.07 * x = 650,000,000. So x = 650e6 / 64.07.

Let me do the division:

64.07 * 10 million is 640,700,000. Subtract that from 650,000,000, we get 9,300,000 left.

Now, 64.07 goes into 9,300,000 approximately 145,000 times (since 64.07 * 145,000 ≈ 9,273,500). So total is about 10,145,000 moles. Let me make it precise. Alternatively, perhaps calculator-like approach:

650,000,000 ÷ 64.07 ≈ 10,146,200 moles of SO2.

Now, looking at the reaction, the mole ratio of SO2 to S is 1 mole SO2 : 3 moles S. Wait, no: the reaction is 2H2S + SO2 → 3S. So for each mole of SO2, 3 moles of S are produced. So the ratio is 1 SO2 : 3 S.

Wait, no—because in the balanced equation, 1 mole of SO2 produces 3 moles of S. So moles of S = moles of SO2 * 3.

So, moles of S = 10,146,200 mol * 3 = 30,438,600 moles of S.

Now, convert that to kilograms. The molar mass of S (sulfur) is 32.07 g/mol. So mass = moles * molar mass.

30,438,600 mol * 32.07 g/mol = ?

Let me compute that. 30,438,600 * 32.07.

Well, 30 million * 32 is 960,000,000. But let's be more precise.

30,438,600 * 32.07 = ?

Let me break it down:

30,438,600 * 30 = 913,158,000
30,438,600 * 2.07 = let's compute that.

30,438,600 * 2 = 60,877,200
30,438,600 * 0.07 = 2,130,701

So 60,877,200 + 2,130,701 = 63,007,901.

So total is 913,158,000 + 63,007,901 = 976,165,901 grams.

Convert that to kg by dividing by 1000: 976,165.901 kg.

Looking at the options, option C is 979,000 kg, which is very close. Hmm, but wait—maybe I made a calculation error.

Wait wait, let me double-check the initial moles.

SO2: 650,000 kg is 650,000,000 grams.

Molar mass of SO2: 64.07 g/mol.

Moles = 650000000 / 64.07 ≈ 10,146,200.47 mol.

Moles of S: 3 * 10,146,200.47 ≈ 30,438,601.4 mol.

Mass of S: 30,438,601.4 mol * 32.07 g/mol.

Let me compute 30,438,601.4 *32.07.

Let me try another approach.

32.07 * 30,438,601.4 = ?

30,438,601.4 * 30 = 913,158,042 g
30,438,601.4 * 2.07 = ?

30,438,601.4 * 2 = 60,877,202.8 g
30,438,601.4 * 0.07 = 2,130,702.1 g
Adding those gives 62,007,904.9 g.

So total is 913,158,042 + 62,007,904.9 = 975,165,946.9 grams. Which is 975,165.946 kg.

Hmm, that's approximately 975,166 kg. Looking at the options, option C is 979,000 kg, which is a bit higher. Option F is 1,020,000, which is higher, and option I is 800,000, which is lower.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 30,438,601.4 * 32.07 more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps using exponents:

30,438,601.4 * 32.07 = ?

Wait, 30,438,601.4 multiplied by 32 is 974,035,244.8, and then 0.07 times 30,438,601.4 is 2,130,702.098.

Adding those together: 974,035,244.8 + 2,130,702.098 = 976,165,946.898 grams, which is 976,165.95 kg.

Hmm, so around 976,166 kg. The closest option is C: 979,000 kg. But wait, option C is 979,000 which is a bit higher. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial mole calculation.

Wait, alternatively, maybe I should compute the exact value using more precise steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use exact molar masses, like S is 32.065 g/mol, but I approximated to 32.07. But that probably won't make a significant difference.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mole ratio. Let me double-check the balanced equation.

The reaction is 2 H2S + SO2 → 3 S + 2 H2O. So for every 1 mole of SO2, 3 moles of S are produced. So the mole ratio is correct.

Another thought: perhaps the problem is considering that both H2S and SO2 are available in certain amounts, but the question says that 650,000 kg of SO2 are deposited. So it's assuming that SO2 is the limiting reactant? Or perhaps H2S is in excess, so SO2 is the limiting.

Wait, the problem states that both H2S and SO2 are waste products. So the reaction uses both, but in this case, the question is about how much S can be recovered when 650,000 kg of SO2 are available. So perhaps we don't need to worry about H2S availability because the problem is giving us only the SO2 and asking what's the maximum S produced from that amount of SO2, assuming H2S is in excess.

So the approach is correct.

Wait, but in the mole ratio, for every mole of SO2, we get 3 moles of S. So if I have 10,146,200 moles of SO2, that would produce 30,438,600 moles of S, which is 30,438,600 * 32.07 = approx 976,166 kg.

So 976,166 kg. But none of the options exactly match this. The closest is option C: 979,000. However, perhaps the calculation uses more precise molar masses or rounding.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise molar masses. Let me check:

Sulfur (S) has a molar mass of 32.065 g/mol.

SO2: S is 32.065, O is 16.00 each. So 32.065 + 2*16.00 = 32.065 + 32 = 64.065 g/mol.

So moles of SO2 = 650,000,000 g / 64.065 g/mol.

Let me compute that more accurately.

650,000,000 / 64.065 ≈ let's see.

64.065 * 10,000,000 = 640,650,000.

Subtract that from 650,000,000: 9,350,000 left.

Now, how many times does 64.065 go into 9,350,000?

64.065 * 145,000 = ?

64 * 145,000 = 9,280,000.

0.065 * 145,000 = 9,425.

So 64.065 * 145,000 = 9,289,425.

But we have 9,350,000. So 9,350,000 - 9,289,425 = 60,575 remaining.

Now, 64.065 goes into 60,575 about 60,575 / 64.065 ≈ 945 times.

So total moles: 10,000,000 + 145,000 + 945 ≈ 10,145,945 moles.

So more accurately, 10,145,945 moles of SO2.

Moles of S: 3 * 10,145,945 = 30,437,835 moles.

Now, mass of S: 30,437,835 * 32.065 g/mol.

Let me compute this:

30,437,835 * 30 = 913,135,050 g

30,437,835 * 2.065 = ?

Wait, perhaps better to compute 30,437,835 * 32.065.

Alternatively, 32.065 = 32 + 0.065.

So 30,437,835 *32 = 974,  let's calculate:

30,437,835 *32:

30,437,835 *30 = 913,135,050

30,437,835 *2 = 60,875,670

Total: 913,135,050 + 60,875,670 = 974,010,720 g.

Now, 30,437,835 *0.065 g = ?

30,437,835 * 0.06 = 1,826,270.1 g

30,437,835 *0.005 = 152,189.175 g

Total: 1,826,270.1 + 152,189.175 = 1,978,459.275 g.

So total S mass: 974,010,720 + 1,978,459.275 = 975,989,179.275 grams.

Convert to kg: 975,989.179 kg. Approximately 975,989 kg.

Looking at the options:

Option C is 979,000 kg.

Hmm, I'm getting about 975,989 kg. So that's very close to 976,000 kg. The option C is 979k, which is about 3,000 kg higher.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculations again for any possible error.

Wait, let me compute 30,437,835 *32.065.

Another approach: 30,437,835 * 32.065 = ?

Well, 30,437,835 * 32 = 30,437,835 *30 + 30,437,835 *2.

Which is 913,135,050 + 60,875,670 = 974,010,720.

Then, 30,437,835 * 0.065 = ?

30,437,835 *0.06 = 1,826,270.1

30,437,835 *0.005 = 152,189.175

Adding them: 1,978,459.275 grams.

Total: 974,010,720 + 1,978,459.275 = 975,989,179.275 grams → 975,989.179 kg.

So approximately 975,989 kg, which is about 976,000 kg.

But the options don't have this exact number. The closest is option C: 979,000 kg, but that's a difference of about 3,000 kg.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial moles of SO2.

Wait, 650,000 kg is 650,000,000 grams.

Divide by 64.065 g/mol: 650,000,000 / 64.065.

Let me compute this division more accurately.

Compute 64.065 × 10,000,000 = 640,650,000.

Subtract from 650,000,000: 9,350,000 remains.

Now, 64.065 × 145,000 = 64.065 * 100,000 = 6,406,500; 64.065 *45,000 = 2,882, 925. So total 6,406,500 + 2,882,925 = 9,289,425.

Wait, 64.065 * 145,000 = 9,289,425.

But our remainder is 9,350,000. So 9,350,000 -9,289,425 = 60,575 grams.

Now, 60,575 / 64.065 ≈ 945.2.

So total moles: 10,000,000 +145,000 +945.2 ≈ 10,145,945.2 moles.

So that's correct.

So the calculation seems correct, giving around 975,989 kg. So perhaps the answer is 976,000 kg, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should check the problem again. The reaction is 2H2S + SO2 → 3S + 2H2O. So for each mole of SO2, 3 moles of S are produced. So that part is correct.

Wait another thought: maybe the question is considering that both H2S and SO2 are present, but the problem gives only the amount of SO2. So perhaps the limiting reagent is SO2, and H2S is in excess, so all the SO2 is converted.

Yes, that's what I assumed earlier.

Hmm, perhaps the options rounded the numbers. Let me compute:

975,989 kg is approximately 976,000 kg.

Looking at the options, option C is 979,000 kg. Maybe the numbers were rounded differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial SO2 is 650,000 kg, but perhaps I should consider the significant figures. The given data has 650,000 kg, which is 3 significant figures (6.5e5). So the answer should be to three significant figures.

So 975,989 kg is 976,000 kg when rounded to three significant figures: 976,000 is 9.76e5, which is three sig figs.

But in the options, option C is 979,000 kg, which is 9.79e5. Hmm, perhaps the initial calculation had some rounding steps that I didn't account for.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use approximate molar masses, like 64 for SO2 and 32 for S.

Let me try that approach.

SO2: 64 g/mol.

Moles of SO2: 650,000 kg = 650,000,000 g.

Molar mass = 64 g/mol.

Moles = 650e6 / 64 = 10,156,250 moles.

Moles of S: 3 * 10,156,250 = 30,468,750 moles.

Mass of S: 30,468,750 * 32 g/mol = 975,000,000 g = 975,000 kg.

Hmm, that's 975,000 kg. The option C is 979,000 kg. Hmm, but this is 975,000, which is not matching any option exactly, but the closest is option C: 979,000.

Wait, perhaps I should see if any of the options are exactly 975,000 kg, but looking at the options, none of them. Option C is 979,000, which is 4,000 kg higher.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different molar mass for S, like 32.065 g/mol.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using exact molar masses:

SO2: 32.065 (S) + 2*16.00 (O) = 64.065 g/mol.

650,000,000 g / 64.065 g/mol = ?

Let me compute this using precise division.

650,000,000 ÷ 64.065 ≈ let me compute.

64.065 * 10,145,000 = ?

Wait, 64 * 10,145,000 = 649,280,000.

0.065 * 10,145,000 = 659, 425.

So total is 649,280,000 + 659,425 = 649,939,425.

But 649,939,425 is less than 650,000,000. The difference is 60,575 grams
