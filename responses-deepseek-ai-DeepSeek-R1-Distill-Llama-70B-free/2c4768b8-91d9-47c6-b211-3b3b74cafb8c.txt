Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about contract law, specifically dealing with merchants and additional terms in an acceptance. Hmm, I need to figure out what's not true about these additional terms. Let me try to break it down.

From what I remember, when two merchants are dealing with each other, the rules for contracts are a bit different, especially under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). I think there's something about additional terms being included even if they weren't part of the original offer. But wait, how does that work exactly?

So the question is about what is not true regarding these additional terms. The options are A through J. Let's see each option.

Option A says the terms become part of the contract only if both parties are merchants. Wait, I think when both parties are merchants, additional terms can become part of the contract more easily. But if one isn't a merchant, maybe it's different. So A might be correct in some cases, but I'm not sure if it's the answer here.

Option B states that the terms are part of the contract unless the offeree objects within a reasonable time. I think that's correct because under UCC § 2-207, if the offeree doesn't object, the terms might stick. So B is true, meaning it's not the answer we're looking for.

Option C says the terms become part only if the offeree agrees within reasonable time. Wait, no, I don't think agreement is required; it's more about not objecting. So C might be incorrect because it's about agreement, not objection. But I'm not certain yet.

Option D claims additional terms always become part of the contract. That doesn't sound right. I remember that sometimes the terms might be considered material alterations, so they wouldn't be included. So D is probably not true, making it a possible answer.

Option E says the terms must be in writing. No, I don't think that's the case. Additional terms can be oral unless the contract requires writing. So E is false, another possible candidate.

Option F states the terms are part unless they materially alter the agreement. Wait, isn't that the case? Like, if the additional terms are material, they might not be included. So F is correct, meaning it's not the right answer.

Option G says the terms are part only if the offeror sends a written confirmation. I don't recall that being a requirement. It's more about the offeree's response, not the offeror sending anything. So G might not be true, another possible option.

Option H says they never become part of the contract. That's definitely not true because additional terms can be included under certain conditions. So H is false.

Option I says the terms are part unless the offer limits acceptance. Oh right, if the offer says something like "only these terms," then additional terms wouldn't be included. So I is correct, not the answer.

Option J states the terms are part unless the offeror objects within reasonable time. Wait, no, the offeree is the one who would object. So J might be incorrect because it's the offeree, not the offeror, who needs to object. So J could be the wrong statement.

Wait, let me clarify. Under UCC 2-207, when a merchant sends an acceptance with additional terms, those terms become part of the contract unless:

1. The offeror (the one making the offer) specifies that the acceptance must be exactly as offered, without additional terms.
2. The additional terms materially alter the contract.
3. The offeror objects to the additional terms within a reasonable time.

Wait, so in this case, if the offeror (the one who received the acceptance) doesn't object, the terms are in. So looking at option J: it says the terms are part unless the offeror objects. That would be correct, so J is true. So that's not the answer.

Wait, no, let's recheck. The question is asking which statement is NOT true. So looking at each option again.

Option C: offeree must agree within reasonable time. No, the offeree doesn't have to agree; if they don't object, it's enough. So C is incorrect because it's about agreement, not objection. So C is not a true statement, making it the answer.

Wait, but earlier I thought about D and E and G. Let me go back.

Option D: Additional terms always become part. No, because sometimes they don't if they're material. So D is false, so it's a possible answer.

The question is which option is NOT true.

So the correct answer would be the statement that is false about the additional terms.

Wait, let me think again. The question is about which is NOT true. So which of these statements is incorrect.

Option C says the terms become part only if the offeree agrees. But under 2-207, the offeree doesn't have to agree; silence can be acceptance. So C is incorrect because it's stating agreement is necessary, which isn't the case. So option C is the false statement.

But wait, option B says that the terms become part unless the offeree objects. That's correct. So B is true.

Option D says they always become part. That's false because sometimes they don't, like if they're material.

So both C and D are incorrect statements. But which one is the answer.

Looking back, the question is about the additional terms proposed in the acceptance. So when a merchant sends an acceptance with additional terms, under 2-207, those terms become part of the contract unless certain exceptions apply.

The exceptions are: (a) the offeror specifies that acceptance must be limited to the terms of the offer, (b) the additional terms would materially alter the contract, or (c) the offeror objects within a reasonable time.

So any option that says something contrary to these would be incorrect.

Option C: They become part only if the offeree agrees. That's not correct because the offeree doesn't have to agree; if they don't object, it's enough. So C is false.

Option D: They always become part. That's wrong because of the exceptions. So D is false.

The question is, which is NOT true. So both C and D are incorrect, but the options only have one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I need to look more carefully.

The question states: what is NOT true about additional terms proposed in the acceptance.

So all the options are statements about when the additional terms become part of the contract. Which statement is incorrect.

Option C: they become part only if the offeree agrees within reasonable time. That's incorrect because the offeree can remain silent, and the terms still become part.

Option B: the terms become part unless the offeree objects. That's correct.

Option D: they always become part. No, because if they're material, they don't. So D is incorrect.

So both C and D are incorrect statements. But the options may have only one correct answer.

Looking at the options, the question is which is not true. So the correct answer would be either C or D.

Wait, the question is phrased as "what is not true about additional terms proposed in the acceptance?"

So, the additional terms are proposals from the offeree, and under 2-207, they become part unless certain conditions.

Option C says that the terms become part only if the offeree (wait, wait, no, the offeree is the one who is accepting. Oh wait, no, the offeror is the one who made the offer, and the offeree is the one who is accepting. So when the offeree sends an acceptance with additional terms, the offeror can object.

So in option C, it's phrased as "the offeree agrees to them within reasonable time." Wait, the offeree is the one sending the additional terms, so the "offeree" here would be the party receiving the acceptance. No, wait, no. Let me clarify.

In the context of the question, the "additional terms proposed in the acceptance" are proposed by the offeree (the one accepting). So the options are talking about the conditions under which these terms become part of the contract.

So in option C, it says "only if the offeree agrees within reasonable time." But the offeree is the one making the acceptance with the additional terms. So the offeree can't be the one agreeing. Wait, that can't be right. So perhaps I got the terms wrong.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as the original offer is made by Party A (offeror), Party B (offeree) sends an acceptance with additional terms. The question is about when those additional terms become part of the contract.

So, the offeree (Party B) adds terms. Do those terms become part of the contract unless the offeror (Party A) objects? Yes, under 2-207.

So looking at the options:

Option C: They become part of the contract only if the offeree (Party B) agrees to them within reasonable time. Wait, that doesn't make sense because Party B is the one proposing the terms. So perhaps there's a typo in the option.

Wait, perhaps the options have a typo. Let me look again.

Option C: They become part of the contract only if the offeree agrees to them within a reasonable time.

No, that can't be right. Because the offeree is the one making the additional terms. So this option is incorrect because the offeree doesn't need to agree; it's the offeror who might object.

So option C is incorrect because it's saying the offeree must agree, which is impossible because the offeree is the one adding the terms. So C is a false statement, making it the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the terms. Let me think again.

The offeree is the one who receives the offer and sends the acceptance. So when the offeree sends an acceptance with additional terms, the offeror (the original party) can either accept those terms, remain silent, or object.

Under 2-207, if the offeror doesn't object within a reasonable time, the additional terms become part of the contract, unless they materially alter it or the offer was limited.

So, option C is saying that the terms become part only if the offeree (the party who sent the acceptance) agrees. That doesn't make sense because the offeree is the one proposing the terms. So this statement is not true, making option C the correct answer.

But wait, another angle: the offeree (Party B) sends the acceptance with terms. So the question is about when those terms become part of the contract.

Option C says that those terms become part only if the offeree (Party B) agrees. But that's impossible because Party B is the one adding them. So the statement is incorrect, meaning option C is the wrong statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the option is referring to the offeror as the offeree? No, the terminology is offeror and offeree. So the additional terms are proposed by the offeree in their acceptance.

Therefore, the correct answer should be option C, because it's incorrectly stating that the offeree must agree, which isn't the case. The offeree is the one making the proposal, so the terms become part unless the offeror objects, not the offeree agreeing.

Wait, but another thought. Maybe the options have a mix-up between offeror and offeree. Let me re-examine each option.

Option J: They become part unless the offeror objects within reasonable time. That's correct because under 2-207, if the offeror objects, the terms don't become part. So J is a correct statement, so it's not the answer.

Option C is incorrect because it's saying the offeree must agree, which isn't necessary. So C is the false statement.

So the question is asking which is not true. So the answer would be C.

To determine what is not true about additional terms proposed in the acceptance between merchants, we analyze the options under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) § 2-207. This section governs how additional terms in an acceptance become part of the contract. The key points are:

1. **Additional Terms Generally**: When a merchant-offeree (the party accepting the offer) proposes additional terms in their acceptance, those terms generally become part of the contract unless:
   - The offeror (the party making the offer) specifies that acceptance must be limited to the terms of the offer.
   - The additional terms materially alter the contract.
   - The offeror objects to the additional terms within a reasonable time.

2. **Analysis of Each Option**:
   - **Option A**: "They become part of the contract only if both parties are merchants." This is true because UCC § 2-207 applies specifically to transactions between merchants. If one party is not a merchant, the rules differ.
   - **Option B**: "They become part of the contract only if the offeree does not object within a reasonable time." This is correct because under § 2-207, the offeror (not the offeree) may object to the additional terms within a reasonable time.
   - **Option C**: "They become part of the contract only if the offeree agrees to them within a reasonable time." This is incorrect because the offeree (the party proposing the additional terms) does not need to agree to their own terms. The terms become part of the contract unless the offeror objects, not the offeree.
   - **Option D**: "Additional terms always become part of the contract." This is false because additional terms do not become part of the contract if they materially alter the agreement or if the offeror objects.
   - **Option E**: "They become part of the contract only if the additional terms are in writing." This is incorrect because additional terms do not need to be in writing unless the contract requires it.
   - **Option F**: "They become part of the contract unless they materially alter the agreement." This is correct because material alterations are one of the exceptions under § 2-207.
   - **Option G**: "They become part of the contract only if the offeror sends a written confirmation within a reasonable time." This is incorrect because no such requirement exists under § 2-207.
   - **Option H**: "They never become part of the contract." This is false because additional terms can become part of the contract under certain conditions.
   - **Option I**: "They become part of the contract unless the offer expressly limits acceptance to the terms of the offer." This is correct because an offer limiting acceptance to its terms is one of the exceptions under § 2-207.
   - **Option J**: "They become part of the contract unless the offeror objects within a reasonable time to the additional terms." This is correct because the offeror's timely objection prevents the additional terms from becoming part of the contract.

3. **Conclusion**: The statement that is not true is **Option C**, as it incorrectly claims that the offeree must agree to the additional terms within a reasonable time. In reality, the offeree does not need to agree; the terms become part of the contract unless the offeror objects.

**Answer: C**
