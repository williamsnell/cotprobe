Okay, so I have this thermodynamics question here about an isothermal expansion of an ideal gas. Hmm, I remember that in thermodynamics, isothermal processes are ones where the temperature stays the same. Right, because "iso" means same and "thermal" relates to temperature.

The question says the gas does 150 J of work against its surroundings. Wait, when a gas expands, it's doing work on the surroundings. So the work done by the gas is positive in this case. I think the formula for work done in expansion is W = PΔV, but wait, more accurately, for an ideal gas undergoing an isothermal process, the work done is calculated using W = nRT ln(V2/V1), since temperature is constant.

But wait, the first law of thermodynamics is ΔU = Q - W, right? Wait no, I think it's ΔU = Q + W when W is the work done on the system. Or maybe I have the signs mixed up. Let me think. In physics, work done by the system is considered positive, so the first law is ΔU = Q - W. Oh wait, some conventions might vary. Let me clarify.

In some conventions, W is the work done by the system. So if the system does work, W is positive. Then the first law would be ΔU = Q - W. But for an ideal gas, the internal energy depends only on temperature. So if the process is isothermal, ΔU is zero because the temperature doesn't change. So 0 = Q - W. That means Q = W.

In this problem, the gas does 150 J of work. So W is positive 150 J. Then Q equals W, so Q is +150 J. That means the system (gas) is absorbing heat from the surroundings. So heat is added to the gas.

Looking at the options, option A says 150 J of heat was added. Option F says 250, which doesn't fit. Option H is 75 added, but that's half. Option B is 300, which doesn't match either. So the correct answer should be option A.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another way: for an isothermal expansion, the work done by the gas is equal to the heat absorbed by the gas. Because the internal energy doesn't change (since temperature is same), so Q must equal W. So yes, if W is 150 J, Q is 150 J added to the gas.

During an isothermal expansion of an ideal gas, the temperature remains constant, meaning the internal energy change (ΔU) is zero. According to the first law of thermodynamics, ΔU = Q - W, where Q is the heat transfer and W is the work done by the system. Since ΔU = 0 for an isothermal process, it follows that Q = W.

In this case, the gas does 150 J of work against its surroundings, so W = +150 J. Therefore, Q must also be +150 J, indicating that 150 J of heat is added to the gas to maintain the constant temperature during the expansion.

Among the given options, the correct description of the heat transfer is that 150 J of heat was added to the gas.
