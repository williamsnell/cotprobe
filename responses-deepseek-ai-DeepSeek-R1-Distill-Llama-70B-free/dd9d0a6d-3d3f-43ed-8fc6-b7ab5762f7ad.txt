Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically regarding the scope of cross-examination in a trial. Hmm, I need to figure out which area of questioning is beyond the proper scope. Let's break it down step by step.

The scenario is a trial for personal injuries from a traffic accident. The plaintiff called the defendant as an adverse party first. Then they called a witness who was a passenger in the plaintiff's car and also the defendant's former employer. On direct, the witness testified about the accident and gave his opinion that the defendant isn't truthful. Now, the question is about the cross-examination of this witness and what's beyond the permissible scope.

So, the issue is about the scope of cross-examination. I remember that cross-examination is limited to the subjects covered in the direct examination and any other matters affecting the credibility of the witness. But it can't go into irrelevant areas unless they're relevant to credibility or the case.

The witness's testimony included his opinion on the defendant's truthfulness. So, on cross, the opposing counsel (probably the defendant's lawyer) can ask about things that challenge the witness's credibility, like prior inconsistent statements, bias, or prior dishonesty.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Defendant sued the witness for breach of contract. That's a dispute between them, which could show bias. So it's relevant for credibility, hence within scope.

Option B: Witness involved in similar accidents before. Maybe it shows he's prone to accidents, but does it relate to his credibility here? Maybe it's about his reliability as a witness, but I'm not sure. It might be allowed if it's relevant to his testimony about the accident.

Option C: Witness and defendant have a personal dispute. That's definitely relevant because it shows bias. So it's within the scope.

Option D: Letters where the witness called the defendant honest. That's a prior inconsistent statement, which directly affects credibility. So cross can bring this up. It's within scope.

Option E: Witness falsifying tax returns. This relates to his character for dishonesty, which is a credibility issue. So it's permissible.

Option F: Witness perjured himself before. Directly goes to his credibility. Allowed.

Option G: Plaintiff's injuries not as serious. Wait, that's about the plaintiff's case, not about the witness's credibility. The witness testified about the accident, but this option is about the plaintiff's injuries. So, maybe this is beyond the scope because it's not about the witness's credibility or the direct testimony unless the witness testified about the injuries. Hmm, the question said the witness testified about how the accident occurred, not about the injuries. So, questioning about the plaintiff's injuries would be beyond the scope of cross-examination of this witness.

Wait, no, the witness was a passenger but didn't testify about the plaintiff's injuries. So, cross-examining the witness about the plaintiff's injuries would be irrelevant to his testimony. Unless the witness had testified about the injuries, which he didn't. So, this would be outside the scope.

Option H: Defendant's traffic violations. That's relevant to the defendant's propensity for reckless driving, but wait, in cross-exam of the witness, that's probably not relevant unless the witness's testimony was about the defendant's driving. Maybe it's allowed as it relates to the issues, but I'm not sure if it's about the witness's credibility. Maybe it's allowed because it's about the defendant's record, which is probative on the issue of the case.

Option I: Witness under influence at the time of the accident. That affects his perception and memory, so it's relevant. So, within scope.

Option J: Defendant planning to sue for defamation. That might indicate some conflict, but if it's a future plan, not sure. It could show bias if the witness is trying to protect himself from a lawsuit, but I'm not certain. It might be a bit speculative, so maybe beyond the scope.

Wait, back to option G. The witness didn't testify about the plaintiff's injuries, so the cross couldn't go into that. Because cross is limited to the scope of direct. So, the question is, which is beyond the proper scope.

So, the correct answer is G. Because the witness's testimony was about the accident and the defendant's truthfulness, not about the plaintiff's injuries. So, cross-examining him about the plaintiff's injuries is outside the scope of his direct testimony and doesn't relate to his credibility.

In this scenario, the witness testified about the accident and the defendant's truthfulness. Cross-examination is generally limited to the subjects covered in direct examination and matters affecting the witness's credibility. 

- **Option A**: A breach of contract lawsuit between the defendant and the witness could show bias, making it relevant to credibility and within the scope.
- **Option B**: The witness's involvement in similar accidents might relate to their reliability as a witness, potentially within the scope.
- **Option C**: A personal dispute between the witness and the defendant is relevant to bias, so it is within the scope.
- **Option D**: Prior inconsistent statements about the defendant's honesty directly affect credibility, making it within the scope.
- **Option E**: Falsifying tax returns relates to the witness's character for dishonesty, which is relevant to credibility.
- **Option F**: Prior perjury directly impacts credibility, so it is within the scope.
- **Option G**: The plaintiff's injuries were not addressed in the witness's testimony, making this line of questioning irrelevant to the witness's credibility or testimony. Thus, it is beyond the proper scope.
- **Option H**: The defendant's traffic violations could be relevant to the case but may not directly relate to the witness's credibility.
- **Option I**: The witness being under the influence of alcohol at the time of the accident affects their perception and memory, making it relevant.
- **Option J**: A planned defamation lawsuit might indicate bias but is speculative and less directly relevant.

The most likely area beyond the proper scope of cross-examination is **Option G**, as it does not relate to the witness's testimony or credibility.

Answer: G
