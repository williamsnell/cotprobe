Okay, so I have this problem about a capacitor's reactance in a circuit, and I need to find its capacitance. Hmm, I remember that capacitive reactance has something to do with the formula involving capacitance and frequency. Let me think.

Wait, the formula for capacitive reactance is Xc equals 1 divided by (2 times pi times frequency times capacitance). Oh right, Xc = 1/(2πfC). So I need to solve for C.

The problem says the reactance is 25 ohms and the frequency is 400 cycles per second, which is 400 Hz. So plugging in the values, Xc is 25, so 25 equals 1 over (2π * 400 * C).

I need to solve for C. Let me rearrange that. Multiply both sides by (2π * 400 * C) to get 25*(2π*400*C) = 1. Then, divide both sides by 25*2π*400 to isolate C. 

Wait, maybe it's easier to write it as C = 1/(2πfXc). Oh yeah, that's right. So plug in the numbers: f is 400, Xc is 25.

So C equals 1 divided by (2 * π * 400 * 25). Let me calculate the denominator first. 2 times 3.1416 is about 6.2832. Multiply that by 400 gives 6.2832 *400 = 2513.28. Then multiply by 25: 2513.28 *25. Let me compute that. 25 times 2500 is 62,500, and 25 times 13.28 is 332. So total is 62,500 +332=62,832. So denominator is about 62,832.

So C equals 1 divided by 62,832. Let me compute that. 1/62,832 is approximately... Let's see, 1/60,000 is about 1.6667e-5. 62,832 is a bit more than 60,000, so the result will be a bit less than that. Let me calculate it more accurately.

Wait, perhaps use exact calculation. 62,832 is 2*π*400*25. Let me compute 2 * pi =6.283185307. Multiply by 400: 6.283185307 *400= 2513.274123. Multiply by 25: 2513.274123 *25. Well, 2500 *25 is 62,500, and 13.274123*25 is 331.853075. So 62500 + 331.853075 =62831.853075. So denominator is 62831.853.

So C is 1/62831.853. Let me compute that. Let's see, 1/62831.85 equals approximately... Let me use a calculator approach. 1e-5 is 0.00001. 62831 is about 6.2831e4. So 1/(6.2831e4) is roughly 1.5915e-5 farads. Because 1/6.283 is about 0.159, so 0.159e-4, which is 1.59e-5 F.

But wait, 1e-6 is microfarad. So 1.59e-5 F is 15.9 microfarads. Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. Let me check my calculation again.

Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Oh wait, no, Xc is 1/(2πfC), so C is 1/(2πf Xc). Let me recompute with exact numbers.

Given Xc=25, f=400. So:

C = 1/(2 * π * 400 * 25)

Compute denominator step by step:

2 * π = approx 6.2832.

6.2832 * 400 = 2513.28.

2513.28 *25 = let's compute 2513.28 *25.

2513.28 *20 = 50,265.6.

2513.28 *5 =12,566.4.

Adding them: 50,265.6 +12,566.4 =62,832.

So denominator is 62,832.

So C =1/62832 = approx 1.5915e-5 F.

Convert to microfarads: 1e-6 F is 1 microfarad, so 1.5915e-5 F is 15.915 microfarads. Hmm, but looking at the options, the closest is option D:20, E:25, or perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me double-check the formula. Oh wait, wait. Oh no, wait, the formula for capacitive reactance is Xc = 1/(2πfC), so solving for C gives C=1/(2πfXc). That's correct. So with Xc=25, f=400:

C=1/(2 * π *400 *25) =1/(2* π *10,000) =1/(62,831.85) ≈ 1.5915e-5 F, which is 15.915 microfarads.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Let me check the options again. The options are:

A:18, B:30, C:8, D:20, E:25, F:16, G:10, H:22, I:12, J:14.

Hmm, none of them is 15.9. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more precisely. Let's compute 2 * pi *400 *25.

2 * pi is 6.283185307.

6.283185307 *400 = 2513.274123.

2513.274123 *25 = let's compute 2513.274123 *25.

25 is a quarter of 100, so 2513.274123 *25 is the same as 2513.274123 *100 /4 = 251327.4123 /4.

251327.4123 divided by 4: 251,327 /4 is 62,831.75, and 0.4123/4 is about 0.103. So total 62831.853.

So C=1/62831.853 ≈ 1.59154e-5 F.

Which is 15.915 microfarads. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I did something wrong.

Wait, maybe the frequency is 400 cycles per second, which is 400 Hz. That's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it using exact fractions. Let me compute it as:

C = 1/(2 * π * f * Xc) = 1/(2 * π *400 *25) = 1/(2 * π *10,000) = 1/(20,000 * π) = (1/20,000) * (1/π) ≈ 0.00005 * 0.31831 ≈ 0.000015915 F, which is 15.915 microfarads.

Hmm, still not matching any option. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, or perhaps the options are incorrect. Alternatively, maybe I missed a factor.

Wait another thought: Did I mix up inductive and capacitive reactance formulas? Let me double-check. Oh, inductive reactance is Xl=2πfL, capacitive is Xc=1/(2πfC). So I think I got it right.

Alternatively, perhaps the question had a typo, but assuming the question is correct, let's see what the options are. The closest option to 15.9 is not present. Wait, let me check again the options:

Options are A:18, B:30, C:8, D:20, E:25, F:16, G:10, H:22, I:12, J:14.

Hmm, so none of the options are close to 15.9. That's odd. Did I miscalculate?

Wait, perhaps I should compute it in a different way. Let's calculate 1/(2 * pi * 400 *25) = 1/(2 * pi * 400 *25).

Wait, 2*400=800, 800*25=20,000. So 2*400*25=20,000. So 2*pi*400*25=20,000 pi.

So C=1/(20,000 pi) ≈ 1/(62,831.85) ≈ 1.5915e-5 F =15.915 microfarads.

So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options. But that can't be, because the options should include the correct one. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the given Xc is 25 ohms, f is 400 Hz.

Wait, another approach: use the formula C=1/(2πfXc). Let's plug in the values:

f=400 Hz, Xc=25 ohms.

Calculate denominator:

2 * pi *400 *25 = 2 *3.1416 *400 *25.

Compute 2 *3.1416 =6.2832.

6.2832 *400=2513.28.

2513.28 *25=62,832.

So denominator is 62,832.

1/62832 = approx 1.5915e-5 F =15.915 microfarads.

Hmm, perhaps I should check if I mixed up the formula. Wait, sometimes I get Xc=1/(omega C), where omega is 2 pi f. So, yes, same as before.

Wait, maybe the question meant 400 Hz, but perhaps I should double-check if it's 400 radians per second, but no, the unit given is cps, which is cycles per second, so Hz.

So perhaps the answer is not among the options, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, let me try a different approach. Compute 1/(2*pi*400*25).

Compute 2 * pi *400 first: 2 * 400=800, so 800 * pi =2513.2741.

Multiply by 25: 2513.2741 *25 = (2500 *25) + (13.2741 *25) =62500 + 331.8525=62831.8525.

So 1/62831.8525 = approx 1.5915e-5 F.

Wait, 1.5915e-5 F is 15.915 microfarads. So perhaps the correct answer is approximately 16 microfarads, but that's option F:16. But wait, 15.9 is closer to 16, but it's not exact. Let me see if I made a miscalculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Wait, 1/62831.8525 equals what? Let me compute 1/62831.8525.

Well, 62831.8525 is 6.28318525e4.

Compute 1/6.28318525e4 = (1/6.28318525) * 1e-4.

1/6.28318525 is approximately 0.1591549431.

So 0.1591549431e-4 F is 1.591549431e-5 F, which is 15.915 microfarads.

So that's 15.915 μF. So the options don't have that. But perhaps the closest is option F:16. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the question uses 400 cycles per second as 400 radians per second? No, because cps is cycles per second, which is Hz, and 1 cycle is 2 pi radians. So 400 Hz is 400 cycles, each 2 pi radians.

Wait, perhaps the formula uses f in terms of radians per second? No, the formula uses f in Hz. Because Xc is 1/(2 pi f C), so f is in Hz.

Wait, maybe I should try computing with more precise pi value.

pi is approximately 3.1415926536.

So 2*pi*400*25 = 2*3.1415926536*400*25.

2*3.1415926536 =6.2831853072.

6.2831853072 *400 =2513.274123.

2513.274123 *25 = let's compute 2513.274123 *25.

2513 *25=62,825.

0.274123 *25=6.853075.

So total 62,825 +6.853075=62,831.853075.

So denominator is 62,831.853075.

C=1/62831.853075 = approx 1.59154943e-5 F.

Which is 15.915 microfarads.

Hmm, perhaps the intended answer is 16 microfarads, option F. But why?

Wait, perhaps in the problem statement, the capacitive reactance is 25 ohms, frequency 400 Hz.

Wait, maybe I should compute using approximate values.

Let me compute 2*pi*400*25 = 2*3.14*400*25.

2*3.14=6.28.

6.28 *400=2512.

2512 *25=62,800.

So denominator is 62,800.

C=1/62,800 =approx 1.5925e-5 F, which is 15.925 microfarads. Still, closest to 16.

Wait, but none of the options is 16. Oh wait, option F is 16 microfarads.

So perhaps the intended answer is F:16 microfarads. Maybe the slight discrepancy is due to rounding in the calculation. So the correct answer would be F.
</think>

To determine the capacitance of the capacitor, we use the formula for capacitive reactance:

\[
X_c = \frac{1}{2 \pi f C}
\]

Rearranging for \(C\):

\[
C = \frac{1}{2 \pi f X_c}
\]

Given \(X_c = 25 \, \Omega\) and \(f = 400 \, \text{Hz}\), substitute the values:

\[
C = \frac{1}{2 \pi (400) (25)}
\]

First, calculate the denominator:

\[
2 \pi \approx 6.2832, \quad 2 \pi \cdot 400 = 2513.28, \quad 2513.28 \cdot 25 = 62832
\]

Thus:

\[
C = \frac{1}{62832} \approx 1.5915 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{F}
\]

Convert to microfarads (\(1 \, \mu\text{F} = 10^{-6} \, \text{F}\)):

\[
C \approx 15.915 \, \mu\text{F}
\]

The closest option to \(15.915 \, \mu\text{F}\) is **16 microfarads**, which corresponds to option **F**. The slight discrepancy is likely due to rounding during calculations.
