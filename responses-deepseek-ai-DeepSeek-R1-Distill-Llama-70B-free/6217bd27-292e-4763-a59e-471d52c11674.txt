Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric fields and moving test charges. Hmm, the question is about finding the direction to move a positive test charge to experience maximum opposing or aiding force. Alright, I'll try to think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the electric force on a charge is given by F = qE. Since the charge here is positive, the force direction depends on the direction of E. Oh wait, but wait, the force when moving the charge is actually the work done. Oh right, when you move a charge against the field, the force opposes you, right? Or wait, no. The force the field exerts is in the direction of E for positive charges. So if you move in the direction of E, the force aids the motion, and if you move against E, the force opposes.

Wait, but in this problem, we're moving the charge, and we're looking for the direction of movement. So the force experienced by the charge is F = qE. But when we move the charge, the work done by the electric field is F · d, where d is the displacement vector.

But the question isn't about work; it's about the direction of movement that gives maximum aiding or opposing force. Oh right, the force experienced by the charge is maximum when the movement is along the direction of the electric field or opposite to it.

Wait, no. Wait, the force on the charge is qE. So if you move the charge in a direction, the force is still qE, regardless of the movement direction. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Oh wait, no, wait. The force experienced by the charge is always qE, but the work done by the electric field depends on the displacement direction. But the problem is asking about the direction in which to move the charge to get maximum opposing or aiding force. So perhaps it's about the direction of movement relative to E.

Wait, but the electric force on the charge is F = qE, and the direction of this force is determined by E. So when you move the charge, the electric force either aids or opposes that movement. So the maximum aiding force would occur when the movement is in the same direction as E, because then the force is in the direction of movement. The maximum opposing would be when movement is opposite to E.

Wait, no, wait. Because F is the force on the charge. So if I move the charge in the direction of E, then the electric force is aiding the motion (since it's pushing in that direction), so that's maximum aiding. Conversely, moving opposite to E would mean the force is opposing, so maximum opposing.

Wait, but the question says "the direction in which a positive test charge should be moved to experience a maximum opposing force." So when the charge is moved opposite to the direction of E, the electric field's force is trying to move it in the direction of E, hence opposing the movement. So that would be moving against E.

But wait, the problem gives the electric field E as -x a_x + y a_y + 3 a_z. So E is a vector, and its components are (-x, y, 3) if I'm not mistaken. Wait, no, no—the E is given as a function of position, but wait no, looking again: the problem states E = -x a_x + y a_y + 3 a_z. Wait, that's confusing. Oh, wait, no, maybe x, y, z are just the variables. So E is (-x, y, 3), but when we evaluate it at a point, say (1,3,-1), we plug in x=1, y=3, z=-1. So E at (1,3,-1) is (-1, 3, 3), right?

Wait, that's important. So at the point (1,3,-1), the electric field E is calculated by substituting x=1, y=3, z=-1 into E. So E becomes:

E = (-1) a_x + (3) a_y + 3 a_z. So E is (-1, 3, 3) at that point.

Wait, but the question is about moving the charge from that point. So the direction of movement is determined by the electric field's direction at that point.

Wait, the question is asking for the direction vector in which to move the charge. So for maximum aiding force, the movement should be in the same direction as E. For maximum opposing, movement should be opposite E.

But wait, wait a second. The electric force on the charge is F = qE. So when moving the charge, the electric field exerts this force. If you move the charge in the same direction as F, then the force aids the movement. If you move opposite to F, the force opposes.

So the direction to move for maximum aiding force is the same as F, which is the direction of E (since q is positive). For maximum opposing, move opposite to E.

So the unit vector in the direction of E is E normalized. Let's compute that.

E at (1,3,-1) is (-1, 3, 3). The magnitude is sqrt( (-1)^2 + 3^2 + 3^2 ) = sqrt(1 + 9 +9) = sqrt(19). So the unit vector is (-1/sqrt(19), 3/sqrt(19), 3/sqrt(19)).

Wait, but the options are given in terms of a_x, a_y, a_z, so the unit vectors are the coefficients. Let me compute each component:

-1/sqrt(19) ≈ -0.2294
3/sqrt(19) ≈ 0.688

So the unit vector is approximately (-0.229, 0.688, 0.688). But wait, wait no—the E is (-1,3,3), so the unit vector is each component divided by sqrt(19). So that's correct.

So for part (a), maximum opposing force would be moving in the direction opposite to E. So the unit vector would be the negative of E's unit vector. So positive (0.229, -0.688, -0.688).

Wait, no: E is (-1,3,3), so the unit vector is (-0.229, 0.688, 0.688). The opposite direction would be (0.229, -0.688, -0.688).

Wait, but looking at the options, each option has two vectors. The first part is for maximum opposing force, and the second is for maximum aiding. Wait, the question says "(a) a maximum opposing force; (b) a maximum aiding force." So the first part is the direction to move to get opposing force, which is opposite to E. The second is the direction of E.

Looking at the options, each option provides two vectors, first for (a), second for (b).

So for (a), the direction is opposite of E's direction. So the unit vector for (a) is (0.229, -0.688, -0.688), right? Because E's unit vector is (-0.229, 0.688, 0.688), so the opposite is (0.229, -0.688, -0.688).

Wait, but let me check: no, wait, the unit vector of E is (-1,3,3) divided by sqrt(19). So each component is (-1,3,3)/sqrt(19). So the opposite would be (1,-3,-3)/sqrt(19), which is (0.229, -0.688, -0.688).

Wait, but looking at the options, which option has a unit vector in (a) as (0.229, -0.688, -0.688) and (b) as (-0.229, 0.688, 0.688)?

Looking at the options:

Option H: a is (-0.229, 0.688, 0.688), b is (0.229, -0.688, -0.688). That's the opposite of what we need. Because for (a), the direction is opposite to E, which would be (0.229, -0.688, -0.688). So looking for an option where (a) is this vector and (b) is the E direction.

Looking... Option E: a is (0.229, -0.688, -0.688), b is (-0.229, 0.688, 0.688). Wait, no. Let me check each option.

Option A: (0.688, 0.229, 0.688) for a, and the opposite for b. No.

Option B: (0.229, 0.229, 0.688) a and opposite for b. No.

Option C: (0.229, -0.688, 0.688) a... Hmm, no.

Option D: (0.229, 0.688, 0.229) a. Not matching.

Option E: a is (0.229, -0.688, -0.688). Yes! That's correct for (a). And (b) would be the E direction, which is (-0.229, 0.688, 0.688). Looking at option E, the b part is (-0.229, 0.688, 0.688), which is correct. So option E's a is (0.229, -0.688, -0.688), and b is (-0.229, 0.688, 0.688). So that's the correct option.

Wait, but let me double-check the components. The E is (-1,3,3), so magnitude sqrt(1+9+9)=sqrt(19)= approx 4.358. So unit vector components are -1/4.358≈-0.229, 3/4.358≈0.688, same for z. So E unit vector is (-0.229, 0.688, 0.688). So (a) is opposite, so (0.229, -0.688, -0.688). Which matches the a part of option E. And (b) is the same as E's direction, which is the unit vector, so option E's b is (-0.229, 0.688, 0.688). So that's correct.

So the correct answer should be option E.

To determine the direction in which a positive test charge should be moved to experience (a) a maximum opposing force or (b) a maximum aiding force in the given electric field **E = -x a_x + y a_y + 3 a_z**, we proceed as follows:

1. **Electric Field at the Point (1, 3, -1):**  
   Substituting \(x = 1\), \(y = 3\), and \(z = -1\) into the expression for **E**, we get:  
   \[
   \mathbf{E} = -1 \, \hat{a}_x + 3 \, \hat{a}_y + 3 \, \hat{a}_z = (-1, 3, 3).
   \]

2. **Magnitude of the Electric Field:**  
   The magnitude of **E** is:  
   \[
   |\mathbf{E}| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 3^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{1 + 9 + 9} = \sqrt{19}.
   \]

3. **Unit Vector in the Direction of E:**  
   The unit vector in the direction of **E** is:  
   \[
   \hat{\mathbf{E}} = \frac{\mathbf{E}}{|\mathbf{E}|} = \left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{19}}, \frac{3}{\sqrt{19}}, \frac{3}{\sqrt{19}}\right) \approx (-0.229, 0.688, 0.688).
   \]

4. **Direction for Maximum Opposing Force:**  
   To experience a maximum opposing force, the charge must be moved opposite to the direction of **E**. The unit vector in this direction is:  
   \[
   \hat{\mathbf{E}}_{\text{opposite}} = \left(0.229, -0.688, -0.688\right).
   \]

5. **Direction for Maximum Aiding Force:**  
   To experience a maximum aiding force, the charge must be moved in the same direction as **E**. The unit vector in this direction is:  
   \[
   \hat{\mathbf{E}}_{\text{same}} = \left(-0.229, 0.688, 0.688\right).
   \]

6. **Matching with the Options:**  
   - For part (a), the direction for maximum opposing force is \((0.229, -0.688, -0.688)\).  
   - For part (b), the direction for maximum aiding force is \((-0.229, 0.688, 0.688)\).  

   Comparing these with the given options, **Option E** matches perfectly:  
   - (a): \((0.229, -0.688, -0.688)\)  
   - (b): \((-0.229, 0.688, 0.688)\).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**E**
