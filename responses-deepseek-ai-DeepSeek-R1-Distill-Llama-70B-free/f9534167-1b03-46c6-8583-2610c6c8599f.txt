Okay, so I have this physics problem here about banking a curve on a road. Hmm, I remember that banking a curve has to do with the angle that the road is tilted so that cars can turn without relying too much on friction. But wait, wait. The problem says the curve is banked for a speed of 20 m/s, and then a car is going around it at 30 m/s. They're asking for the minimum coefficient of static friction needed to prevent skidding. 

I think the key formulas I need here are related to circular motion and friction. Oh right, when a car is going around a banked curve, there's a certain ideal speed where friction isn't needed because the normal force provides all the necessary centripetal force. But if the car is going faster or slower than that, friction comes into play.

So the formula for the ideal banking angle theta is given by tan(theta) = v²/(r g), where v is the intended speed, r is the radius, and g is gravity. That's when friction isn't needed. But if the car's speed is higher than that, like here, 30 m/s instead of 20, then friction must provide an inward force to prevent the car from skidding outward.

Wait, no, when the car goes faster than the design speed, does it tend to go outward, needing more centripetal force, which would require friction acting inward? Or does the car have a tendency to slide up the bank, so the friction would act down the bank? Hmm, maybe I should draw a free-body diagram.

Let me visualize this. The car is moving along a banked curve. The forces acting on it are gravity (mg downward), the normal force (perpendicular to the surface), and static friction (which can act either up or down the slope, depending on the situation). 

In the case where the car is moving faster than the design speed, the required centripetal force is greater than what the banking provides without friction. So the car might have a tendency to slide outward, which is the outside of the curve. But wait, no—wait, when moving faster, the car tends to move outward, which would require an additional inward force. But the direction of static friction depends on the direction the car would slide if there were no friction. If the car is moving too fast, it would want to move outward (up the bank?), so friction would act inward (down the bank) to prevent that.

Wait, no, maybe I got it backward. If the speed is higher than the design speed, the centripetal force required is F = mv²/r. The banking provides some of that, but not enough, so friction must make up the difference. So the frictional force would point toward the center of the circle, which, in this case, is inward. That would mean friction acts down the slope because if the car is moving too fast, it would tend to go outward, and friction would oppose that outward motion, providing an inward component.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of components. Let me break down the forces into radial and vertical components. The car's acceleration is centripetal, so a = v²/r towards the center.

In the banked turn, the normal force is perpendicular to the surface, so it has both horizontal (radial) and vertical components. Similarly, the frictional force, which acts along the surface, has components too.

Let me remember the standard approach. When the car is moving at a speed v, the net force towards the center must be mv²/r. The normal force and friction contribute to this.

For the banked curve, the design speed is 20 m/s. So for that speed, the banking angle is such that when the car goes at 20 m/s, no friction is needed. So the normal force provides all the necessary centripetal force. So tan(theta) = v0²/(r g), where v0 is 20 m/s.

But when the speed is higher, v = 30 m/s, the required centripetal force is larger. So the frictional force must provide the additional inward force needed.

So I can write the equations for the forces in the radial direction and the vertical direction.

In the vertical direction, the sum of forces should be zero because there's no acceleration upwards or downwards.

Sum of vertical forces: N * cos(theta) - mg - f * sin(theta) = 0

Wait, wait, let me make sure. The normal force is N, and it's at an angle theta from the vertical. So its components are N cos(theta) vertical and N sin(theta) horizontal (towards the center). Friction f acts along the surface, opposing the relative motion. In this case, if the car is moving faster than v0, friction acts inward (down the slope) to prevent sliding outward. So friction's components are f cos(theta) in the opposite direction of motion (but wait, no, friction is acting inward, so its horizontal component is towards the center, and vertical component is downward. Wait, no. If the slope is inclined at theta, then the friction force acting inward (towards the center) would have a component f cos(theta) in the vertical direction and f sin(theta) in the radial direction. Wait, no, perhaps not. Let's think: the slope is banked at theta, so the surface is inclined. If the car tends to move outward, friction acts inward. So the friction force is tangential to the surface and points toward the center. So the frictional force f is directed along the bank, toward the center. So when broken into components:

f has a component along the radius (horizontal) and a vertical component. The angle of the friction with the horizontal is theta. So the horizontal component would be f cos(theta) (towards the center) and the vertical component would be f sin(theta) downward.

So in the vertical direction, the normal force's vertical component is N cos(theta), and the friction's vertical component is f sin(theta) downward. The weight is mg downward. So sum of vertical forces:

N cos(theta) - mg - f sin(theta) = 0.

In the radial (horizontal) direction, the components are N sin(theta) (from the normal force) and f cos(theta) (from friction). These both point toward the center, so the sum is mv²/r.

So the radial equation is:

N sin(theta) + f cos(theta) = (mv²)/r.

But wait, let me make sure: N sin(theta) is the normal force's component towards the center. Friction f acts along the slope toward the center, so its horizontal component is f cos(theta) (since the angle between f and horizontal is theta). So yes, both add up to the required centripetal force.

Now, we have two equations:

1) N cos(theta) - mg - f sin(theta) = 0

2) N sin(theta) + f cos(theta) = mv²/r

We need to find the coefficient of static friction, mu, which is the maximum possible f over the normal force. So f <= mu*N. Since we're looking for the minimum mu required, f will be equal to mu*N.

So let me substitute f = mu*N into the equations.

First equation becomes:

N cos(theta) - mg - (mu*N) sin(theta) = 0.

We can rearrange this to:

N [cos(theta) - mu sin(theta)] = mg.

Second equation:

N sin(theta) + (mu N) cos(theta) = mv²/r.

Factor N:

N [sin(theta) + mu cos(theta)] = mv²/r.

We can solve equation 1 for N:

N = mg / [cos(theta) - mu sin(theta)].

Substitute this into equation 2:

[mg / (cos(theta) - mu sin(theta))] * [sin(theta) + mu cos(theta)] = mv²/r.

The m's cancel out. So:

g [sin(theta) + mu cos(theta)] / [cos(theta) - mu sin(theta)] = v²/r.

We can rearrange this equation to solve for mu.

Let me write it as:

g [sin(theta) + mu cos(theta)] = (v²/r) [cos(theta) - mu sin(theta)].

Multiply out both sides:

g sin(theta) + g mu cos(theta) = (v²/r) cos(theta) - (v²/r) mu sin(theta).

Now, collect terms with mu on one side:

mu [g cos(theta) + (v²/r) sin(theta)] = (v²/r) cos(theta) - g sin(theta).

So, mu = [ (v²/r) cos(theta) - g sin(theta) ] / [ g cos(theta) + (v²/r) sin(theta) ]

Hmm, but I don't know theta yet. Oh wait, theta is the banking angle, which is determined by the design speed v0 = 20 m/s.

So for v0, the ideal speed, tan(theta) = v0²/(r g).

So tan(theta) = (20)^2/(120 * 9.8). Let me calculate that.

20^2 is 400. 120 * 9.8 is 1176. So tan(theta) = 400/1176 ≈ 0.340.

So theta ≈ arctan(0.340) ≈ let's see, arctan(0.35) is about 19 degrees, but since 0.340 is a bit less, maybe around 18.7 degrees.

But perhaps I can find sin(theta) and cos(theta) in terms of v0, r, and g.

Alternatively, from tan(theta) = v0²/(r g) = (v0^2)/(r g) = (20^2)/(120 * 9.8) = 400/(1176) ≈ 0.340.

So let's compute sin(theta) and cos(theta). Let me think of a right triangle where the opposite side is v0², and the adjacent is r g. So the hypotenuse would be sqrt( (v0^2)^2 + (r g)^2 )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to express sin(theta) and cos(theta) in terms of v0²/(r g).

tan(theta) = (v0²)/(r g) = 400/(120 * 9.8) ≈ 0.340.

So let me compute sin(theta) = (v0^2) / sqrt( (v0^2)^2 + (r g)^2 )

And cos(theta) = (r g) / sqrt( (v0^2)^2 + (r g)^2 )

Alternatively, perhaps I can express sin(theta) and cos(theta) using the relation tan(theta) = (v0²)/(r g) = (v0²)/(R), where R = r g.

Wait, but I think there's a better way. Let me think about the expressions in the mu equation.

Wait, the mu equation I derived was:

mu = [ (v²/r) cos(theta) - g sin(theta) ] / [ g cos(theta) + (v²/r) sin(theta) ]

But since tan(theta) = (v0^2)/(r g), perhaps I can replace sin(theta) and cos(theta) in terms of v0, r, and g.

Alternatively, maybe substitute sin(theta) = (v0^2) / sqrt( (v0^2)^2 + (r g)^2 ) and cos(theta) = (r g) / sqrt( (v0^2)^2 + (r g)^2 )

But that might get complicated. Perhaps a smarter approach would be to express everything in terms of tan(theta), since we know that.

Let me write sin(theta) = tan(theta) / sqrt(1 + tan^2(theta)).

Similarly, cos(theta) = 1 / sqrt(1 + tan^2(theta)).

Let me compute tan(theta) = (v0^2)/(r g) = (20^2)/(120 * 9.8) = 400 / 1176 ≈ 0.340.

So tan(theta) ≈ 0.340.

Then, cos(theta) = 1 / sqrt(1 + (0.340)^2 ) ≈ 1 / sqrt(1 + 0.1156) = 1/sqrt(1.1156) ≈ 1/1.056 ≈ 0.947.

Similarly, sin(theta) ≈ tan(theta) * cos(theta) ≈ 0.340 * 0.947 ≈ 0.322.

But let me do this more accurately.

Compute denominator: sqrt(1 + (0.34)^2) = sqrt(1 + 0.1156) = sqrt(1.1156) ≈ 1.056.

So cos(theta) ≈ 1 / 1.056 ≈ 0.947.

sin(theta) ≈ 0.34 * 0.947 ≈ 0.322.

But perhaps I should carry exact expressions. Let me see:

tan(theta) = (v0^2)/(r g) = (400)/(1176) ≈ 0.340.

So for the mu equation:

mu = [ (v²/r) cos(theta) - g sin(theta) ] / [ g cos(theta) + (v²/r) sin(theta) ]

v is 30 m/s, r=120 m, g=9.8 m/s².

Compute (v²/r) = (30)^2 / 120 = 900/120 = 7.5 m/s².

Wait, wait, 7.5 is in units of acceleration? Hmm, not sure, but perhaps it's just a numerical factor.

So (v²/r) = 7.5.

Similarly, g is 9.8.

So let me plug in the numbers:

Numerator:

(7.5) * cos(theta) - 9.8 * sin(theta)

Denominator:

9.8 * cos(theta) + 7.5 * sin(theta)

We have cos(theta) ≈ 0.947, sin(theta) ≈ 0.322.

Compute numerator:

7.5 * 0.947 = approx 7.5 * 0.947 ≈ 7.5 * 0.95 = 7.125, but more accurately: 7.5 * 0.947 = 7.5*(0.9 + 0.047) = 6.75 + 0.3525 = 7.1025.

Then, 9.8 * 0.322 ≈ 9.8 * 0.3 = 2.94, 9.8 * 0.022= 0.2156 → total ≈ 2.94 + 0.2156 ≈ 3.1556.

So numerator ≈ 7.1025 - 3.1556 ≈ 3.9469.

Denominator:

9.8 * 0.947 ≈ 9.8 * 0.9 = 8.82, 9.8 * 0.047 ≈ 0.4606 → total ≈ 8.82 + 0.4606 ≈ 9.2806.

Then, 7.5 * 0.322 ≈ 2.415.

So denominator ≈ 9.2806 + 2.415 ≈ 11.6956.

So mu ≈ 3.9469 / 11.6956 ≈ approx 0.3375.

Wait, but let me check my calculations more accurately.

Let me recompute:

Compute (v²/r) = 30^2 / 120 = 900/120 = 7.5.

Compute numerator: (7.5 * cos(theta)) - (9.8 * sin(theta)).

With cos(theta) ≈ 0.947, sin(theta) ≈ 0.322.

7.5 * 0.947 = 7.5 * 0.9 = 6.75; 7.5 * 0.047 = 0.3525 → total 7.1025.

9.8 * 0.322 = let's compute 10 * 0.322 = 3.22 → subtract 0.2 * 0.322 = 0.0644 → 3.22 - 0.0644 = 3.1556.

So numerator = 7.1025 - 3.1556 = 3.9469.

Denominator: (9.8 * cos(theta)) + (7.5 * sin(theta)).

9.8 * 0.947 = let's compute 9 * 0.947 = 8.523, 0.8 * 0.947 = 0.7576 → total 8.523 + 0.7576 = 9.2806.

7.5 * 0.322 = 2.415.

Denominator = 9.2806 + 2.415 = 11.6956.

So mu = 3.9469 / 11.6956 ≈ 0.3375.

So approximately 0.338.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Options are A:0.6, B:0.28, C:0.75, D:0.25, E:0.45, F:0.55, G:0.65, H:0.15, I:0.34, J:0.42.

Hmm, 0.338 is closest to option I, which is 0.34.

Wait, but let me re-examine the calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the numerator and denominator more accurately.

Wait, let's compute (v²/r) cos(theta) = 7.5 * cos(theta).

But wait, perhaps it's better to keep more decimal places when computing cos and sin(theta).

Let me recompute tan(theta) first.

tan(theta) = (20)^2/(120 * 9.8) = 400/(1176) ≈ 0.340.

Compute tan(theta) = 0.340.

Compute cos(theta) = 1 / sqrt(1 + tan^2(theta)) = 1/sqrt(1 + 0.1156) = 1/sqrt(1.1156).

What's sqrt(1.1156)? Let me calculate it more accurately.

sqrt(1.1156) = approx 1.056 (since 1.056^2 = (1 + 0.056)^2 = 1 + 2*0.056 + 0.056^2 = 1 + 0.112 + 0.003136 = 1.115136, which is very close to 1.1156. So sqrt(1.1156) ≈ 1.056.

So cos(theta) = 1/1.056 ≈ 0.947.

Similarly, sin(theta) = tan(theta) * cos(theta) = 0.340 * 0.947 ≈ 0.322.

But perhaps using exact values would be better.

Alternatively, let's consider another approach without approximating theta, but using exact expressions.

We have tan(theta) = v0²/(r g) = (20)^2/(120 * 9.8) = 400/(1176) = 25/29.4 ≈ 0.340.

Wait, but perhaps we can
