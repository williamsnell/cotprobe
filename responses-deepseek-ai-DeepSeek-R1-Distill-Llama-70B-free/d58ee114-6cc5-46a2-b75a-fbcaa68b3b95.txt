Question:

A commissioner of a sports league was charged with embezzling funds by increasing the amount of his allocated travel expenses without the approval of a majority of the team owners. In accordance with the bylaws of the league's charter, the commissioner was required to obtain the approval of at least half the owners before raising his expense allocation. At trial, the commissioner seeks to testify that his predecessor told him that he had authority under the league's charter to raise his expense allocation. The commissioner's testimony is

Options:

A: admissible, to show the precedent set by the predecessor.
B: inadmissible, because it is second-hand information.
C: inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.

E: admissible, as it can prove the commissioner's innocence.
F: inadmissible, because the predecessor's statement cannot be verified.
G: admissible, to show that the commissioner lacked criminal intent.
H: inadmissible, as it is not relevant to the case.
I: admissible as evidence of the routine practice of an organization.
J: admissible, as it gives insight into the league's charter interpretation.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically hearsay. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a commissioner of a sports league who's been charged with embezzlement. He increased his travel expenses without the team owners' approval. The bylaws say he needs at least half the owners to approve any raise. Now, at trial, he wants to testify that his predecessor told him he had the authority to raise his expense allocation. The question is whether this testimony is admissible.

First, I need to figure out what the commissioner is trying to achieve with this testimony. It seems like he's trying to show that he didn't intend to commit a crime because he thought he had the authority. So, he's using his predecessor's statement to support his defense, probably to argue that he didn't have the requisite criminal intent.

Now, under the rules of evidence, when a witness testifies about an out-of-court statement made by someone else, that's generally hearsay. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. So, the commissioner is testifying about what his predecessor said, which is an out-of-court statement, and he's offering it to prove that he had authority. That would make it hearsay.

But wait, are there any exceptions where this would be admissible? Let me think about the hearsay exceptions. One possible exception is the statement against interest, but that doesn't apply here because the predecessor's statement isn't against his interest. Another exception could be statements by a party opponent, but the predecessor isn't a party here. 

There's also the exception for statements of personal or family history, but that doesn't fit here either. Another thought: could this be admissible under the "state of mind" exception? But that usually applies when the statement is about the speaker's will or intent, not the listener's.

Alternatively, maybe it's admissible to show the commissioner's state of mind—his belief that he had authority. Wait, but the commissioner's testimony is about what the predecessor told him, which he's using to prove that he had authority. So, the purpose is to establish that he thought he was authorized, thus negating intent. But the problem is that the statement itself is being offered for the truth of the matter—that he did have authority. So it's hearsay.

Another angle: maybe it's not hearsay because it's not offered for the truth. If he's offering it just to show that he relied on it, perhaps that's not hearsay. Wait, but if he's using it to show that he had authority, then it's for the truth. Because he's saying, "My predecessor told me I could do this," which implies that he actually had the authority, which is the truth of the matter.

Wait, but the commissioner's own testimony about what his predecessor told him could be admissible to show his state of mind, specifically his belief that he was authorized. The Federal Rules allow for evidence of a person's state of mind, like their intent or plan, but I think that only applies in certain contexts. However, if the statement is being used to prove that he believed he had authority, then it's not for the truth, but for his belief. But wait, I'm a bit confused here. 

Hearsay is an issue when the statement is offered for the truth. So if the statement is being offered to prove that he believed he had authority, that's not hearsay. It's about his state of mind, not the truth of the predecessor's statement. So, in that case, it wouldn't be hearsay. But if it's used to prove that he actually had authority (the truth), then it's hearsay.

In this case, the commissioner is trying to prove that he had authority, so he's using the predecessor's statement for the truth. Therefore, it's hearsay. So unless there's an exception, it's inadmissible.

Looking at the options, option C says it's inadmissible as hearsay not within any exception. Option G says it's admissible to show he lacked criminal intent. Wait, because if he thought he had authority, he might not have had the intent to embezzle. So, the testimony is about his state of mind, not the truth of the predecessor's statement.

Wait, so perhaps it's admissible as evidence of his state of mind, specifically his belief that he was authorized, which would negate criminal intent. So, the testimony isn't being offered for the truth (that he did have authority), but for the effect on him (he believed he had authority).

But wait, the way the question is phrased, the commissioner is testifying that his predecessor told him he had authority. So, the statement is being offered to prove that he had authority, which is the truth. Therefore, it's hearsay. But if it's offered to show his belief, then it's not hearsay.

So, the key is the purpose for which the statement is being offered. If it's to show that he believed he had authority (thus, lacking intent to embezzle), then it's not hearsay. But if it's to show that he actually had authority, then it's hearsay.

The question says the commissioner seeks to testify that his predecessor told him he had authority. So, the purpose is to show that he had authority, which is the truth of the matter. Therefore, it's hearsay, and unless an exception applies, it's inadmissible.

So, looking back at the options:

A: Admissible to show precedent. Maybe, but that's more about business records or routine practice, perhaps. But the statement is about authority, not routine.

B: Inadmissible as second-hand. Well, second-hand is hearsay, but B says it's inadmissible because it's second-hand. But the reason would be hearsay, not merely being second-hand.

C: Inadmissible as hearsay without exception. That's a possibility.

D: Best evidence rule. The best evidence rule applies when the content of a writing is in question; the original is preferred. But here, the charter is the writing, but the testimony is about the predecessor's statement, not the content of the charter. So D might not apply here.

E: Admissible to prove innocence. That's too broad; it's about whether it's hearsay.

F: Inadmissible because can't verify. That's not a legal reason; it's about the evidence's admissibility, not weight.

G: Admissible to show lack of criminal intent. If the testimony is about his belief, then it's not hearsay. So this could be correct.

H: Not relevant. But it's relevant because it goes to his intent.

I: Routine practice. Maybe as a business record or under the routine practice exception, but the statement is from a predecessor, not a current record.

J: Insight into charter interpretation. Possibly, but again, it's hearsay unless it's admissible under an exception.

Wait, so if the testimony is about the predecessor's statement to show the commissioner's belief, then it's not hearsay. But if it's to show the truth, then it is hearsay.

The question is, what is the commissioner offering the testimony for? If it's to prove he had authority (truth), then hearsay. If it's to prove he thought he had authority (belief), then not hearsay.

The question states that the commissioner seeks to testify about the predecessor's statement. So, the purpose is to establish that he had authority, implying truth. But maybe it's also to show his belief. The line can be blurry.

In criminal cases, the defendant's state of mind is crucial. So, the testimony would be relevant to show that he didn't have the intent to embezzle because he thought he was authorized. Therefore, it's not being offered for the truth of the predecessor's statement, but for its effect on the commissioner's mind.

So, in that case, it's not hearsay. Therefore, the testimony would be admissible for that purpose. Looking at the options, option G says it's admissible to show he lacked criminal intent. That would fit because it's about his state of mind.

But wait, another thought: even if it's not hearsay, is there another rule that might make it inadmissible? For example, if the predecessor's statement is being used as substantive evidence that he had authority, it's hearsay. But if it's used just to show the commissioner's belief, then it's not hearsay.

So, the commissioner's testimony is about what the predecessor said. If the purpose is to show that the commissioner believed he had authority, then it's admissible. But if the purpose is to prove that he did have authority, then it's hearsay.

The question is about the admissibility, so the key is the purpose for which it's offered. The question says the commissioner is testifying about the predecessor's statement to establish that he had authority. So, the purpose is the truth, making it hearsay.

Wait, but the actual purpose might be dual. He might be using it both to show he thought he had authority (so, state of mind) and to prove that he actually did have authority. But if the latter is the case, then it's hearsay.

So, if the testimony is being used to prove that he had authority, it's hearsay. If it's to prove he believed he had authority, it's not hearsay.

But in this scenario, the commissioner is charged with embezzlement, which requires intent to deprive the league of funds. If he can show he thought he had authority, he lacked the intent. So, the testimony is about his state of mind, not the truth of the predecessor's statement.

Therefore, it's not hearsay. So option G would be correct.

Wait, but another angle: the statement is from the predecessor, who is presumably not available. So, is there an exception? Or is it non-hearsay because it's about the listener's state of mind.

I think the key here is that when a statement is offered to prove the effect on the listener, it's not hearsay. So, if the commissioner is testifying that his predecessor told him X, and that made him believe Y, then it's admissible to show his belief, not the truth of X.

So, in this case, it's admissible to show his state of mind, which is relevant to criminal intent. So, the testimony is admissible under option G.

But wait, let me think again. The options are:

C: Inadmissible as hearsay not within any exception.

G: Admissible to show that the commissioner lacked criminal intent.

If the testimony is being used to show his belief, it's not hearsay, so C would be incorrect, and G would be correct.

So, the correct answer would be G.

But wait, another point: the statement is about the predecessor's interpretation of the league's charter. Could that be admissible as an interpretation? I don't think so, because it's still hearsay.

Alternatively, if the league's charter is a document, the best evidence rule would require the document itself, but that's probably not the issue here.

So, putting it all together, the commissioner's testimony about the predecessor's statement is admissible to show his state of mind, specifically his lack of criminal intent because he thought he had authority. Therefore, it's not hearsay, making option G correct.
</think>

The commissioner's testimony about his predecessor's statement is being offered to establish that he believed he had authority to raise his expense allocation, which is relevant to his state of mind and intent. In criminal cases, a defendant's belief in their authority can negate the specific intent required for embezzlement. 

Under the rules of evidence, a statement is hearsay if it is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. However, if the statement is offered to show its effect on the listener's state of mind, it is not considered hearsay. Here, the commissioner is testifying about the predecessor's statement to demonstrate his belief that he had authority, not to prove the truth of the statement itself. Therefore, it is admissible to show the commissioner's lack of criminal intent.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The testimony is not about establishing a precedent but about the commissioner's state of mind.
- **B**: Incorrect. While the statement is second-hand, the admissibility issue is not merely about being second-hand but whether it is hearsay.
- **C**: Incorrect. The testimony is not hearsay because it is offered to show the commissioner's belief, not the truth of the predecessor's statement.
- **D**: Incorrect. The best evidence rule applies to the content of writings, not to the commissioner's testimony about a statement.
- **E**: Incorrect. The testimony's admissibility is not based on proving innocence but on its relevance to the commissioner's state of mind.
- **F**: Incorrect. The verifiability of the statement is not the legal basis for its admissibility.
- **G**: Correct. The testimony is admissible to show the commissioner's lack of criminal intent by demonstrating his belief in his authority.
- **H**: Incorrect. The testimony is relevant because it pertains to the commissioner's intent, a key element of the charge.
- **I**: Incorrect. The testimony does not establish a routine practice of the organization.
- **J**: Incorrect. The testimony is not about interpreting the league's charter but about the commissioner's belief.

The correct answer is **G** because the testimony is admissible to show the commissioner's lack of criminal intent by demonstrating his belief that he had authority. 

Answer: G
