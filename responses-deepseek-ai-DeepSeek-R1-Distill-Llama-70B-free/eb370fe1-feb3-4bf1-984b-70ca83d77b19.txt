Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about cultural differences in how people experience shame and guilt when admitting family problems. Let me try to break this down.

The question is asking which traditional group commonly feels intense shame and guilt when they admit to a counselor that a family problem exists. The options are various ethnic groups. I'm a bit rusty on cultural psychology, but I'll try to recall what I know.

From what I remember, different cultures have different values around family and seeking help. For example, some cultures place a strong emphasis on family honor and privacy. If a family problem is exposed, it might bring shame not just to the individual but to the entire family. This could make people from these cultures hesitant to seek help outside the family because of the fear of being judged or bringing dishonor.

I think Hispanic and Latino cultures, for example, have a strong sense of familismo, which is the importance of family and keeping family matters private. Similarly, Asian cultures also prioritize family honor and might feel shame when admitting to problems outside the family.

Wait, but the question is about feeling intense shame and guilt when admitting to a counselor. So which group is more likely to experience this? I remember that in many Asian cultures, saving face is crucial. Admitting a problem might mean losing face, which brings shame. So Asian-Americans might be more likely to feel this way.

But I also recall that Hispanic families might feel similar because of their close-knit family ties. They might feel that seeking help outside the family is a sign of weakness or betrayal. So both B (Asian-Americans) and F (Hispanics) could be candidates.

Wait, the options are A through G, and the choices include B as Asian-Americans and F as Hispanics. The question is about traditional groups, so maybe it's more about collectivist cultures. Both Asian and Hispanic cultures are collectivist, emphasizing family over individual needs.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is B, Asian-Americans, because in some Asian cultures, mental health issues are particularly stigmatized. Families might avoid seeking help to prevent shame. Similarly, in Hispanic cultures, there's a stigma too, but I'm not sure which one is more emphasized in this context.

Another angle: the term "intense feelings of shame and guilt" upon admitting might relate more to how the culture views personal and family honor. If the culture strongly ties individual actions to family reputation, then admitting a problem could be seen as a failure, leading to more pronounced feelings of guilt and shame.

I think in many Asian cultures, there's a strong emphasis on not bringing shame to the family. So, for example, a person might feel that by admitting a family problem, they're exposing the family's issues, which is unacceptable. This would lead to intense feelings of guilt and shame.

So, putting it all together, the answer is probably B: Asian-Americans.

The question asks which traditional group commonly experiences intense feelings of shame and guilt when admitting family problems to a counselor. The analysis considers cultural values around family honor, privacy, and the stigma of seeking help. Both Asian and Hispanic cultures emphasize family and privacy, but the emphasis on saving face and avoiding shame in Asian cultures is particularly strong. This makes Asian-Americans more likely to feel intense guilt and shame in such situations.

Answer: B
