Okay, so I have this physics problem about a helium-cadmium laser. Hmm, I remember that lasers can emit light at specific wavelengths, and this one has two: 325 nm and 488 nm. The question is about the distance at which these two components would be separated by 1 cm due to diffraction. Alright, I need to figure this out.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on diffraction. Oh right, when a laser beam travels, it spreads out due to diffraction. The angle at which it spreads depends on the wavelength and the diameter of the beam. So the longer wavelength would spread more, I think. Because shorter wavelengths have less diffraction, or is it the other way around? No, wait, longer wavelengths have larger diffraction angles. Right, because the diffraction angle θ is proportional to λ/(diameter). So for 325 nm (which is ultraviolet, I think) and 488 nm (blue maybe?), the 488 nm light will spread out more.

So the problem says that the two wavelengths are in the same beam, 2 mm in diameter. They want to know at what distance their separation is 1 cm. So I guess the separation is the difference in their spot sizes or something. Wait, but wait. Each wavelength spreads at a different rate. So the separation between their centers is probably due to their different divergence angles.

Wait, no. Wait, when a beam is emitted, each wavelength diverges at a slightly different angle. So after traveling a distance z, each wavelength's spot has a radius r = z * tanθ, where θ is the diffraction angle. The separation between the two spots would be the difference in their radii multiplied by 2, because each is spreading from the center. Or wait, maybe each has a radius, and the separation is the difference in radius times something else.

Wait, let's think. The diffraction angle θ is given by θ = λ/(π N A), where N.A. is the numerical aperture. Wait, or perhaps θ ≈ λ/(D), where D is the diameter. Oh wait, the formula I think is θ ≈ 1.22 λ / (D), but that's for the angular resolution in terms of diffraction limit. Wait, maybe the divergence angle is roughly λ/(π D), or something like that. Oh wait, the formula for the beam divergence is θ = λ/(π w_0), where w_0 is the beam waist. Oh right, because for a Gaussian beam, the divergence angle is 2λ/(π D), since D is the diameter, which is 2w_0. So θ = λ/(π w_0) = 2λ/(π D). Hmm, but I might be getting this wrong.

Wait, let's think about the far field. The diffraction pattern for a circular aperture has the first minimum at sinθ = 1.22 λ/D. So the angle θ is approximately 1.22 λ/D for small angles, which can be approximated as tanθ ≈ θ. So the divergence angle is θ ≈ 1.22 λ/D.

Wait, but wait, for a Gaussian beam, the divergence angle is θ = 2λ/(π D), which for small angles is about 0.637 λ/D. So which one applies here? Oh, the problem says "diffraction-limited performance", which I think refers to the Gaussian beam case. So in that case, θ = 2λ/(π D). Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the formula for the spot size after distance z is w(z) = w0 * sqrt(1 + (z/z_R)^2 ), where w0 is the initial beam waist, and z_R is the Rayleigh range. But if the beam is initially at the waist (z=0), then as z becomes much larger than z_R, w(z) ≈ w0 * (z/z_R). And z_R is π w0^2 / λ. So substituting, w(z) ≈ w0 * z/(π w0^2 / λ) ) = λ z/(π w0). Since the initial beam diameter is 2 mm, the initial waist w0 is 1 mm, so 1e-3 m.

Wait, but how does this relate to the separation between the two wavelengths?

Each wavelength will have a different divergence. So each will spread into a Gaussian beam with a certain spot size at distance z. The separation between their centers would be the difference in their spot sizes times some factor. Wait, but since the beam is circular, the center is the same; the spots are spreading around the center. Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh wait, no, perhaps the two different wavelengths are emitted in the same beam, so their centers coincide, but their spot sizes are different. So the separation between the edges of the two spots is the difference in their radii.

Wait, but the question says the two components are separated by 1 cm. So maybe we're looking at the separation between the centers of their diffraction patterns? No, that doesn't make sense, because they're emitted from the same point. Perhaps it's the difference in their spot sizes. So the radius of the 488 nm spot minus the radius of the 325 nm spot is 0.5 cm (since the separation is 1 cm between the edges, so each contributes half). Or wait, maybe it's the sum, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the angular separation. Hmm, but I don't think so. Because the separation is given as 1 cm, which is a linear measure, implying that after traveling a distance z, the two beams have spread such that their centers are 1 cm apart. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because they started from the same point. Oh wait, perhaps the separation is the size of each spot, but I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps the separation refers to the difference in their spot diameters. So the 488 nm spot is larger than the 325 nm spot, and the difference in their radii is 0.5 cm. Or maybe the total diameter difference is 1 cm. Hmm.

Let me think again. The formula for the spot radius at distance z is r = (λ z)/(π w0). Because, as I thought earlier, for z >> z_R, the spot size grows linearly with z.

So for each wavelength, r1 = (λ1 z)/(π w0) and r2 = (λ2 z)/(π w0). The separation between their edges would be r2 - r1. Because the 488 nm spot is larger than the 325 nm spot.

Wait, but in the problem, the separation is given as 1 cm. So we can set up the equation: r2 - r1 = 0.5 cm? Or is it 1 cm? Because 1 cm is the total separation between the two edges. So if the 488 nm spot has a radius r2 and the 325 nm has radius r1, the separation between their edges would be (r2 - r1) = 1 cm.

Wait, but if that's the case, then:

r2 - r1 = (λ2 z)/(π w0) - (λ1 z)/(π w0) ) = z (λ2 - λ1) / (π w0) ) = 0.01 m (1 cm).

So solving for z:

z = (0.01 m * π w0 ) / (λ2 - λ1 )

Wait, let's plug in the numbers. Let me get the values straight.

λ1 = 325 nm = 325e-9 m

λ2 = 488 nm = 488e-9 m

w0 is the initial beam radius, which is 1 mm = 1e-3 m.

So substituting:

z = (0.01 * π * 1e-3) / (488e-9 - 325e-9 )

Calculate denominator: 488e-9 -325e-9 = (488-325)*1e-9 = 163e-9 m.

So denominator is 1.63e-7 m.

So:

z = (0.01 * π * 1e-3) / (1.63e-7 )

Compute numerator: 0.01 is 1e-2.

So 1e-2 * π * 1e-3 = π * 1e-5.

So numerator is πe-5.

So z = (πe-5) / 1.63e-7 ≈ (3.1416e-5) / (1.63e-7) ) meters.

Compute that: 3.1416e-5 / 1.63e-7 = approx (3.1416 / 1.63 ) * 1e2.

3.1416 / 1.63 ≈ 1.928.

So 1.928 * 1e2 = 192.8 meters.

Looking at the options, the closest is option G: 200 m, but wait, let me check my calculations again because perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, in the problem statement, the beam is 2 mm in diameter, so w0 is 1 mm, that's correct.

Wait, let me redo the calculation more accurately.

Numerator: 0.01 m * π * 0.001 m = 0.01 * π * 0.001 = 1e-5 * π ≈ 3.14159e-5.

Denominator: (488-325)*1e-9 = 163e-9 m = 1.63e-7 m.

So z = (3.14159e-5) / (1.63e-7) = 3.14159e-5 / 1.63e-7 ≈ Let's compute this.

3.14159e-5 is 0.0000314159.

1.63e-7 is 0.000000163.

So 0.0000314159 / 0.000000163 ≈ (3.14159 / 1.63 ) * (1e-5 / 1e-7) ) → 3.14159/1.63 is about 1.928, and 1e-5/1e-7 is 100, so 1.928 * 100 = 192.8 meters.

So approximately 193 meters. The options are A:100, B:50, C:120, D:150, E:40, F:250, G:200, H:300, I:75, J:500.

So the closest is G:200 m. But wait, my calculation got 192.8, which is 193. So perhaps the intended option is G:200 m.

But wait, let me double-check the approach because I might have made a wrong assumption.

Wait, earlier I assumed that the separation between the edges is r2 - r1 = 1 cm. But maybe the separation is the full 1 cm between the two spots. So if each spot's radius is r, then the separation between the centers would be r2 - r1 = 1 cm? No, that doesn't make sense because both are centered on the same axis. Wait, no, the two beams are emitted together, so their centers coincide. So their edges would be separated by (r2 - r1), but if that's 1 cm, then yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the diameter difference. So the diameter of the 488 nm spot is d2 = 2 r2, and the 325 nm is d1=2r1. So the difference in diameters is d2 - d1 = 2(r2 - r1). If the problem states that this difference is 1 cm, then 2(r2 - r1) = 0.01 m. So r2 - r1 = 0.005 m. Then z would be (0.005 * π * 1e-3 ) / ( (488e-9 - 325e-9 ) )

Wait, let me compute that.

z = (0.005 * π * 1e-3 ) / (1.63e-7 )

So 0.005 is 5e-3.

5e-3 * π * 1e-3 = 5e-6 * π ≈ 1.5708e-5.

Divide by 1.63e-7:

1.5708e-5 / 1.63e-7 ≈ (1.5708 / 1.63 ) * 1e2 ≈ 0.964 * 1e2 = 96.4 meters. That's about 96 meters, which would be closest to option E:40, I:75, or maybe not. Wait, 96 is close to 100 (option A is 100m), but perhaps this approach is wrong.

Hmm, this is confusing. Because the initial approach gave me 193 m, which is near 200 m, but if I consider the diameter difference, it's 96 m.

Wait, perhaps the problem is referring to the separation between the two spots as 1 cm, not the difference in their sizes. Let me think differently. Suppose each wavelength's beam spreads, and their centers are the same, but the question is about the lateral separation between the two beams. No, that doesn't make sense because they start together. So maybe the problem is considering the size of each spot, and the separation between the edges is 1 cm. So for example, the 488 nm spot has a radius r2, and the 325 has r1, and the separation between their edges is r2 - r1 = 0.005 m (since 1 cm is 0.01 m, so the difference in radii is 0.005 m each side? No, wait, no. Wait, if the total separation between the two edges is 1 cm, then r2 + r1 = 0.01 m. Wait, but that would be if the two spots are next to each other, but that's not the case. They are both spreading from the same center. So the separation between the two outer edges would be (r2 - r1) * 2? I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think in terms of each wavelength's spot size. The spot diameter for each would be approximately (2λ z)/(π D), since spot radius is (λ z)/(π D/2 ), wait no. Let's try to clarify.

Wait, the formula I think is that the beam radius at distance z is w(z) = (λ z )/(π w0 ), where w0 is the initial beam waist radius. Since the initial diameter is 2 mm, w0 is 1 mm = 1e-3 m. So for each wavelength, the radius is (λ z)/(π * 1e-3 )

So the radius for 488 nm: r488 = (488e-9 m * z )/( π * 1e-3 m )

Similarly, r325 = (325e-9 * z )/( π * 1e-3 )

The separation between their edges is r488 - r325 = 1 cm = 0.01 m.

Wait, no. Because the separation between the edges would be the difference in their radii, right? Because both are centered on the same point, so the edge of the 488 nm spot is r488 away from the center, and the edge of the 325 nm spot is r325 away. So the separation between their edges is (r488 - r325 ). But wait, that's only if the 488 nm spot is larger. So the separation between the two edges is (r488 - r325 ) = 0.01 m.

So set up the equation:

(r488 - r325 ) = 0.01 m

Substituting the expressions:

(488e-9 * z )/( π * 1e-3 ) - (325e-9 * z )/( π * 1e-3 ) ) = 0.01

Factor out z/( π * 1e-3 ):

[ (488e-9 - 325e-9 ) * z ] / ( π * 1e-3 ) ) = 0.01

Compute 488e-9 -325e-9 = 163e-9 = 1.63e-7 m.

So:

(1.63e-7 m * z )/( π * 1e-3 m ) ) = 0.01 m

Simplify denominator: π * 1e-3 = 3.1416e-3 ≈ 3.1416e-3.

So:

(1.63e-7 * z ) / (3.1416e-3 ) ) = 0.01

Multiply both sides by 3.1416e-3:

1.63e-7 * z = 0.01 * 3.1416e-3

Compute right side: 0.01 * 3.1416e-3 = 3.1416e-5.

So:

z = (3.1416e-5 ) / (1.63e-7 ) ≈ 192.8 meters.

So 192.8 meters is approximately 193 m. The closest option is G:200 m.

But let me check the options again. Option G is 200 m. So that's the intended answer.

I think I got that right. So the answer is G.

To determine the distance at which the two wavelengths (325 nm and 488 nm) from a helium-cadmium laser are separated by 1 cm due to diffraction, we analyze the diffraction-limited spreading of the laser beam. The beam has an initial diameter of 2 mm, so the initial beam radius (waist) is \( w_0 = 1 \, \text{mm} = 1 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m} \).

The radius of a Gaussian beam at a distance \( z \) is given by:

\[
w(z) = \frac{\lambda z}{\pi w_0}
\]

For the two wavelengths, the radii at distance \( z \) are:

\[
w_{325} = \frac{325 \times 10^{-9} \, z}{\pi \times 10^{-3}}, \quad w_{488} = \frac{488 \times 10^{-9} \, z}{\pi \times 10^{-3}}
\]

The separation between the edges of the two spots is the difference in their radii:

\[
w_{488} - w_{325} = \frac{(488 \times 10^{-9} - 325 \times 10^{-9}) z}{\pi \times 10^{-3}}
\]

The problem specifies that this separation is 1 cm (\( 0.01 \, \text{m} \)):

\[
\frac{(488 \times 10^{-9} - 325 \times 10^{-9}) z}{\pi \times 10^{-3
