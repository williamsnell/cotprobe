Okay, so I need to figure out how much Mrs. Smith will have in her savings account after 5 years, including the interest she's earned. Let's see. She deposited $200 at a 5% interest rate, compounded semiannually. Hmm, I remember that compound interest means the interest is added multiple times over the period.

Wait, semiannually means the interest is compounded twice a year, right? So each compounding period is six months. I think the formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:
- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- P is the principal amount ($200 in this case).
- r is the annual interest rate (5%, so 0.05 as a decimal).
- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year (since it's semiannual, n=2).
- t is the time in years (5 years here).

So plugging in the numbers:
P = 200
r = 0.05
n = 2
t =5

Let me compute the exponent part first. nt would be 2*5=10. So the exponent is 10. Then, r/n is 0.05/2 = 0.025. So each compounding period, the amount increases by 2.5%.

Now the formula becomes A = 200*(1 + 0.025)^10. Let me calculate 1.025 raised to the 10th power. Hmm, 1.025^10. I might need to remember the value or calculate it step by step.

Wait, I think 1.025^10 is approximately 1.2800845. Let me double-check that. Alternatively, I can compute it step by step.

Another approach: 1.025^2 = 1.050625, then 1.050625^5. Hmm, because (1.025)^10 is the same as (1.025^2)^5.

Wait, (1.025)^2 is 1.025 * 1.025. Let's calculate that.

1.025 * 1.025: 1 * 1 is 1. 1 * 0.025 is 0.025. 0.025 *1 is another 0.025. 0.025*0.025 is 0.000625. So adding all together: 1 + 0.025 +0.025 +0.000625 = 1.050625. So yes, (1.025)^2 is 1.050625.

Now, 1.050625 raised to the 5th power. Hmm, that's a bit more involved. Let me compute it step by step.

1.050625^1 = 1.050625
1.050625^2 = 1.050625 * 1.050625. Let me compute that. 1.05 *1.05 is 1.1025, but considering the exact numbers.

Wait, maybe I should use a different approach. Alternatively, I can use logarithms or natural exponentials, but that might be complicated.

Alternatively, maybe I can look up a table or approximate. But since I'm just trying to solve this without a calculator, perhaps I can compute it step by step.

Wait, perhaps I should compute (1.050625)^5.

Let me compute each power step by step.

1st power: 1.050625

2nd power: 1.050625 * 1.050625. Let's compute:

First, 1 * 1.050625 is 1.050625, then 0.05 * 1.050625 is 0.05253125, and 0.000625 * 1.050625 is 0.000656640625. So adding these together: 1.050625 + 0.05253125 = 1.10315625, then + 0.000656640625 = 1.103812890625.

So 1.050625^2 ≈ 1.10381289.

Now, 3rd power is (1.10381289) * 1.050625.

Let me compute that. 1 * 1.10381289 = 1.10381289, 0.05 * 1.10381289 is 0.0551906445, 0.000625 * 1.10381289 is approximately 0.000690474. Adding them: 1.10381289 + 0.0551906445 = 1.1590035345, plus 0.000690474 gives about 1.1596940085.

So approximately 1.159694.

4th power: 1.159694 * 1.050625.

Let me compute each part:

1 * 1.159694 = 1.159694
0.05 * 1.159694 = 0.0579847
0.000625 * 1.159694 ≈ 0.0007249606.

Adding together: 1.159694 + 0.0579847 = 1.2176787, plus 0.0007249606 gives approximately 1.21840366.

So 1.21840366.

5th power: 1.21840366 * 1.050625.

Again, breaking it down:

1 * 1.21840366 = 1.21840366
0.05 * 1.21840366 = 0.060920183
0.000625 * 1.21840366 ≈ 0.0007610023.

Adding these: 1.21840366 + 0.060920183 = 1.27932384, plus 0.0007610023 gives approximately 1.28008484.

So, (1.050625)^5 ≈ 1.28008484. So the total A is 200 * 1.28008484.

Calculating that: 200 * 1.28008484 = 256.016968, which is roughly $256.02.

So the total amount is approximately $256.02. Therefore, the interest earned is 256.02 - 200 = $56.02.

Looking at the options, option E says $256.02 and $56.02. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculations. Alternatively, I can compute using the formula with n=2 and t=5.

Alternatively, using the formula step by step:

Each compounding period, the amount increases by 2.5% (since 5% annually, so 2.5% semiannually). Over 5 years, that's 10 compounding periods.

So after each period, the amount is multiplied by 1.025.

Let me compute each year step by step for 10 periods.

Principal: $200.

After 1st period: 200 * 1.025 = 205.

2nd: 205 * 1.025 = 210.125.

3rd: 210.125 *1.025. Let's compute 210.125 *1.025.

210 *1.025 is 215.25. 0.125*1.025 is 0.128125. So total 215.25 + 0.128125= 215.378125.

4th period: 215.378125 *1.025.

Hmm, 215 *1.025 = 215 + (215 * 0.025) = 215 +5.375=220.375. 0.378125 *1.025 ≈ 0.387109. So total ≈220.375 + 0.387109=220.762109.

Wait, maybe that's getting too tedious. Alternatively, perhaps I should accept that my initial calculation of 1.025^10 is about 1.2800845, so 200 *1.2800845=256.0169, which rounds to $256.02, so option E.

Yes, that seems correct. So the answer is E.

To determine how much Mrs. Smith will have in her savings account after 5 years, including the interest earned, we use the compound interest formula:

\[
A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}
\]

Where:
- \(P = 200\) (principal amount),
- \(r = 0.05\) (annual interest rate),
- \(n = 2\) (compounded semiannually),
- \(t = 5\) (time in years).

First, calculate the total number of compounding periods:

\[
nt = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Next, calculate the interest rate per compounding period:

\[
\frac{r}{n} = \frac{0.05}{2} = 0.025
\]

Now, compute the compound interest factor:

\[
\left(1 + 0.025\right)^{10} \approx 1.2800845
\]

Finally, calculate the total amount after 5 years:

\[
A = 200 \times 1.2800845 \approx 256.02
\]

The total interest earned is:

\[
\text{Interest} = A - P = 256.02 - 200 = 56.02
\]

Thus, Mrs. Smith will have $256.02 in her account, and she will have earned $56.02 in interest. Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**E: $256.02 and $56.02**
