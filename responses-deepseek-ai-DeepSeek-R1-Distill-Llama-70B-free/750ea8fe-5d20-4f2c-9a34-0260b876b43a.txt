Okay, so I have this DNA question here. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question gives me the antisense (noncoding) strand of DNA as 5' ATG GAT AAA GIT TTA AAC AGA GAG GAA TCT 3'. Then it asks for three things: a) the sense strand, b) the mRNA transcribed, and c) the polypeptide chain translated.

Wait, I remember that DNA is double-stranded. The antisense strand is complementary to the sense strand, which is the one that's used as a template for transcription. Oh wait no, actually, the antisense is the noncoding strand, so the sense strand is the coding one, which is the same as the mRNA but with T instead of U.

So for part a), the sense strand would be complementary to the antisense. Since the antisense is 5' ATG GAT AAA GIT TTA AAC AGA GAG GAA TCT 3', the sense strand would run 3' to 5', right? Because DNA strands are antiparallel.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the sense strand is the same as the mRNA, except T for U. But the antisense is the one that's complementary to the mRNA. So antisense is the noncoding strand, which is the template for the mRNA.

Wait, maybe I should clarify. The DNA has two strands: the coding (sense) and noncoding (antisense). The mRNA is synthesized using the antisense as a template, so the mRNA will be same as the sense strand, except T becomes U.

Wait, no, actually, the mRNA is synthesized from the antisense (noncoding) strand. Because the antisense is the template. So the mRNA is complementary to the antisense, so same as the sense strand but with U instead of T.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. DNA has two strands: sense (coding) and antisense (noncoding). The antisense is the one that serves as the template for mRNA transcription. So mRNA is complementary to the antisense DNA strand, which makes it same as the sense DNA strand, but with uracil instead of thymine.

So for part a), the sense strand would be the complement of the antisense strand, but in the same direction. Because the antisense is given as 5' to 3', the sense strand would run 3' to 5', but wait, no. Wait, no, the sense strand is the coding strand, which is the same direction as the mRNA. Because mRNA is synthesized 5' to 3' using the antisense as a template.

Wait, let me get this right. The antisense strand is 5' ATG GAT AAA GIT TTA AAC AGA GAG GAA TCT 3'. So the sense strand would be the complement of this, but in the 5' to 3' direction. Because DNA is antiparallel.

Wait, the antisense is 5' to 3', so the sense strand should run 3' to 5', but wait, the sense strand is the non-template, so it's in the same direction as mRNA. Wait, no. Wait, the antisense is the template, so the mRNA is complementary to the antisense and runs 5' to 3'. So the sense strand is the same as the mRNA, but with T instead of U. So the sense strand would be 5' [complement of antisense] 3'?

Wait, maybe I should write the antisense strand and find its complement. Let's take it step by step.

The antisense (noncoding) strand is 5' ATG GAT AAA GIT TTA AAC AGA GAG GAA TCT 3'. So to find the sense strand, which is the complementary strand, but in the opposite direction.

Wait, DNA strands are antiparallel. So the sense strand is the complement of the antisense but written in the opposite direction. So the antisense is 5' ATG GAT ... TCT 3', so the sense strand would be 3' TAC CTA ... AGA 5' or 5' AGA ... TAC 3'? No, wait, because the sense strand is in the same direction as mRNA. The mRNA is synthesized 5' to 3', complementary to the antisense strand.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to first write the antisense strand, then write the complementary sense strand in the opposite direction.

Antisense: 5' A T G G A T A A A G I T T T A A A C A G A G A G G A A T C T 3'

Wait, wait, but DNA is made of A, T, C, G. So the 'I' here must be a typo, perhaps? Because in DNA, I don't think I (inosine) is present. Unless this is a mistake. Maybe it's a typo, and should be T or C or something. Wait, looking back, the options have 'GIT' so maybe it's a mistake. Let me see the options. Option B has 'GUU' in the mRNA. Hmm.

Wait, but maybe I should proceed. So each part of the antisense strand: 

Each DNA nucleotide triplet would be:

ATG GAT AAA GIT TTA AAC AGA GAG GAA TCT

Wait, but GIT isn't a standard DNA triplet. Normally, DNA uses G, so maybe it's a typo, perhaps C? Or T? Or maybe it's a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps it's a RNA nucleotide, but the question is about DNA.

Alternatively, maybe it's a typo, and perhaps should be GAT or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a mistake, but I'll proceed as if it's correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, I see that option C has in the mRNA 'GUU UUA', which comes from TTA in the DNA sense strand. So perhaps the DNA antisense is correct as given, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps for the purpose of solving this, I'll proceed, assuming that the 'I' is a typo and perhaps it's a 'T', but no, that's just a guess. Alternatively, maybe it's a different base. Alternatively, perhaps it's a DNA strand, so 'I' stands for inosine, but that's rare. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and should be C or something else. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question meant to write 'GIT' as a typo for 'CTT' or something. Maybe it's a mistake, but perhaps I should proceed as if it's correct, but perhaps in the options, it's corrected.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'I' is a typo, and should be 'C' or 'T', but without knowing, it's hard to proceed. But perhaps the options can help.

Wait, looking at the options, option C's mRNA is 5' AUG GAU AAA GUU UUA AAC AGA GAG GAA UCU 3'. So in the DNA sense strand, that would correspond to ATG GAT AAA GTT TTA AAC AGA GAG GAA TCT, perhaps. Because mRNA is complementary to the antisense DNA.

Wait, wait. Let's think for part a) the sense strand. The antisense is given as 5' ATG GAT AAA GIT TTA AAC AGA GAG GAA TCT 3'. So the sense strand will be the complement of this, but in the opposite direction.

So, to find the sense strand, I need to reverse complement the antisense.

So, the antisense is 5' ATG GAT AAA GIT TTA AAC AGA GAG GAA TCT 3'.

Each codon is three bases. Let me write the entire antisense strand as a single sequence.

Antisense strand (noncoding): 5' ATG GAT AAA GIT TTA AAC AGA GAG GAA TCT 3'

But wait, 'GIT' is a problem. Let's see, perhaps it's a typo. Let's check the options. Looking at option C, the mRNA has 'GUU' as a codon, which would come from 'CAA' in the antisense. Wait, no, mRNA is complementary to the antisense.

Wait, perhaps the 'I' in DNA is a mistake and should be a 'C'. Let me proceed under that assumption. So, the antisense is ATG GAT AAA CTT TTA AAC AGA GAG GAA TCT. So the sense strand would be the reverse complement.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'I' is a mistake and is actually a 'T', making it ATT. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed without getting stuck on that.

But perhaps the options can help. Let me look at the options provided. The options for part a) the sense strand are various. For example, option B shows the sense strand as 3' TAC CTA TTT CAA AAT TTG TCT CTC CTT AGA 5', which is the reverse complement of the antisense.

Wait, so let's compute the reverse complement of the antisense.

Antisense: 5' ATG GAT AAA GIT TTA AAC AGA GAG GAA TCT 3'

Let me write it as a single string: ATGGATAAAGITTTAAACAGAGAGAATCT.

Wait, but 'I' is not a standard DNA base. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo and should be 'G', making it GAT? Hmm, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps it's a 'T', making it GTT. Hmm, but without knowing, I can't be certain.

Alternatively, maybe I can proceed by recognizing that in the mRNA, T becomes U. So for part b), the mRNA would be complementary to this antisense strand.

Wait, the mRNA is synthesized from the antisense strand, so it will be the same as the sense strand, but with U instead of T. So the mRNA will be 5' [complement of antisense] 3' with T→U.

Wait, perhaps the way to approach this is:

Antisense DNA: 5' ATG GAT AAA GIT TTA AAC AGA GAG GAA TCT 3'

So the mRNA would be complementary to this, so 5' [complement of each base in reverse order] but with U instead of T.

Wait, no, the mRNA is synthesized as the complement of the antisense, in the 5'→3' direction. So the antisense is the template, so the mRNA is built in the 5'→3' direction as the complement.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to take each codon of the antisense, reverse it, and complement each base.

But maybe I should write the antisense in reverse complement to get the sense strand.

Alternatively, the sense strand is the same as the mRNA but with T instead of U. So perhaps finding the mRNA will help.

Wait, let me try to write the antisense as a single sequence, then reverse it, then complement each base to get the sense strand.

So antisense: 5' ATG GAT AAA GIT TTA AAC AGA GAG GAA TCT 3'

Writing as a single string: ATGGATAAAGTTTAAACAGAGAGAATCT

Wait, but again, the 'I' is a problem. Maybe it's a typo for 'G'? So perhaps it's ATGGATAAAGGTTTAAACAGAGAGAATCT? Hmm, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps for the sake of solving this, I'll proceed, assuming that the 'I' is a typo and perhaps it's a 'T', making it ATT. Then the antisense is ATG GAT AAA GTT TTA AAC AGA GAG GAA TCT.

Wait, but then the mRNA would be complementary to that. So each mRNA codon would be the complement of each DNA codon in the antisense.

Wait, no, because mRNA is synthesized as the complement of the antisense, so the mRNA is built in the 5'→3' direction, which is the same direction as the sense strand.

Wait, perhaps if I take the antisense, reverse it, and complement each base, I get the sense strand.

So let's proceed.

Antisense: 5' ATG GAT AAA GIT TTA AAC AGA GAG GAA TCT 3'

First, reverse it to get 3' TCT AGA AGT AGA AAC TTG ITT AAA TAG GAT ATG 5'

Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of the entire strand.

Wait, the antisense is written 5' to 3', so the sense strand would be 3' to 5' as the reverse complement.

So to make the sense strand, which is 5' to 3', I can take the antisense, reverse it, then take the complement.

Wait, no. Wait, the sense strand is the same as the mRNA, except T instead of U. So perhaps I can find the mRNA first.

The mRNA is synthesized from the antisense strand, so it's complementary to the antisense, in the 5'→3' direction.

So the antisense is 5' ATG GAT AAA GIT TTA AAC AGA GAG GAA TCT 3'

So the mRNA would be 5' [complement of each base in reverse order] with T→U.

Wait, perhaps it's better to take the antisense strand, write it in reverse order, then take the complement of each base, and then replace T with U for mRNA.

So antisense: 5' A T G G A T A A A G I T T T A A A C A G A G A G G A A T C T 3'

Let me reverse the order of the antisense strand to get 3' T C T A A G G A G T C A A A T T G I T A A A G A T G A T A G 5'

Wait, that's getting confusing. Alternatively, perhaps I can write the antisense as a sequence, reverse it, and then take the complement.

Wait, let me write the antisense as a single string, then reverse it, then complement each base.

Antisense (5'→3'): A T G G A T A A A G I T T T A A A C A G A G A G G A A T C T

Wait, but I can't have 'I' in DNA. Maybe it's a typo. Let's see the options. Option C's mRNA starts with AUG, which suggests that the first codon is ATG in DNA.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed, ignoring the 'I' for now.

So, the antisense is 5' ATG GAT AAA GIT TTA AAC AGA GAG GAA TCT 3'

Let me reverse this to get 3' TCT AAG GAT AGA AAC TTT GIT AAA TAG GAT ATG 5'

Wait, but that's not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps the sense strand is the reverse complement.

So the sense strand would be 3' TAC CTA TTT CAA AAT TTG TCT CTC CTT AGA 5', as in option B and C.

Wait, looking at option B and C, their sense strands are 3' TAC CTA TTT CAA AAT TTG TCT CTC CTT AGA 5'.

Hmm, that makes sense as the reverse complement of the antisense.

Wait, let me compute the reverse complement of the given antisense.

Antisense (5'→3'): ATG GAT AAA GIT TTA AAC AGA GAG GAA TCT

Let me break it down into individual bases:

A T G G A T A A A G I T T T A A A C A G A G A G G A A T C T

Wait, but again, the 'I' complicates things. Assuming the 'I' is a mistake, perhaps it's a 'T', making it ATT.

Alternatively, perhaps the 'I' is a 'C'. Let's assume the antisense is ATG GAT AAA CTT TTA AAC AGA GAG GAA TCT.

Wait, that would make more sense. So the antisense is 5' ATG GAT AAA CTT TTA AAC AGA GAG GAA TCT 3'

Now, to find the sense strand, which is the reverse complement.

So, reverse the antisense: 3' TCT AAG GAT CGA AAT TTG TTT AAA TAG GAT ATG 5'

Wait, no, perhaps I should reverse the entire strand first, then take the complement of each base.

Wait, let's take the antisense 5' ATG GAT AAA CTT TTA AAC AGA GAG GAA TCT 3'

Reverse the order: 3' TCT AAG GAT CGA AAT TTG TTT AAA TAG GAT ATG 5'

Wait, no, perhaps I should write each base in reverse order.

Antisense: 5' A T G G A T A A A C T T T T A A A C A G A G A G G A A T C T 3'

Wait, perhaps the correct antisense is 5' ATG GAT AAA CTT TTA AAC AGA GAG GAA TCT 3'

Now, to get the sense strand, which is the reverse complement.

So, reverse the antisense sequence to get 3' TCT AAG GAT CGA AAT TTA AAC AGA GAG GAA TCT 3'

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to take each base, reverse the order, then complement each.

So the antisense is 5' A T G G A T A A A C T T T T A A A C A G A G A G G A A T C T 3'

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to take each base, reverse the entire sequence, then complement each base.

So the antisense is 5' A T G G A T A A A C T T T T A A A C A G A G A G G A A T C T 3'

Reversing this, we get 3' T C T A A G G A G T C A A A T T T C A A A G A T G G A T A G 5'

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the sense strand is the reverse complement of the antisense.

Wait, let me compute the reverse complement properly.

The antisense strand (5'→3'): A T G G A T A A A C T T T T A A A C A G A G A G G A A T C T

Wait, perhaps I should write each triplet:

ATG GAT AAA CTT TTA AAC AGA GAG GAA TCT

Now, reverse the entire sequence:

TCT AAG GAT CGA AAC TTT AAA TAG GAT ATG

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Alternatively, perhaps computing the complement of
