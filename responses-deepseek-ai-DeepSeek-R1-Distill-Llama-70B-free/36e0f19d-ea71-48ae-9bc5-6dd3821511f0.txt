Okay, let's try to figure this problem out. So, we have two identical conducting spheres that are fixed in place. Initially, they attract each other with a force of 0.108 N at a separation of 50.0 cm. Then, when connected by a thin wire and removed, they repel each other with a force of 0.0360 N. We need to find the initial negative charge on one of them, given that the net charge is positive.

Hmm, okay, so I remember Coulomb's Law here. The force between two point charges is F = k * |q1 * q2| / r². But wait, these are conducting spheres, so when they're connected, charges will redistribute.

Let me think about the two scenarios. Initially, the spheres attract each other, so one must be positive and the other negative. After connecting them with a wire, they must have the same charge because they're conductors and in contact. But wait, the problem says that when the wire is removed, they repel. So that means after connection, both have the same sign of charge. So their initial charges must have been opposite.

Let me denote the initial charges as q1 and q2. Since they attract, let's say q1 is positive and q2 is negative. Or vice versa, but the point is their product is negative.

Wait, but after connecting, the spheres will share the total charge. Since they're identical, each will have the same charge. So the total charge is q1 + q2, and each sphere will have (q1 + q2)/2.

But then, after removing the wire, the force is repulsive. So the charge on each sphere must be the same sign, meaning that (q1 + q2)/2 is positive, because the net charge is positive as given.

Wait, the problem says "with a positive net charge", so the total charge is positive. So (q1 + q2) must be positive.

So let's outline the steps:

1. Initial state: q1 and q2, opposite signs (since they attract). Let's say q1 is positive, q2 is negative.

2. After connecting, each has charge (q1 + q2)/2.

3. After disconnecting, the force is repulsive, so both charges are positive. Because their product is positive.

So, the initial charges must be such that when they're combined, the result is a positive charge on each.

So let me set up the equations.

First, initial force F1 = 0.108 N.

F1 = k * |q1 * q2| / r²

But wait, since they're attracting, the product q1*q2 is negative. So the magnitude is |q1 * q2|.

After connecting, each has charge (q1 + q2)/2. The new force F2 = 0.036 N, and since they repel, the product is positive, so F2 = k * [ ( (q1 + q2)/2 )^2 ] / r².

Wait, but wait, the separation distance—did it change? The problem doesn't say so. I think the separation remains the same, 50 cm.

So we can write F1 and F2 in terms of q1 and q2.

Let me write the equations.

Equation 1: F1 = (k * |q1 q2| ) / r² = 0.108 N.

Equation 2: F2 = (k * ( (q1 + q2)/2 )^2 ) / r² = 0.036 N.

Since r is the same, I can take the ratio of F1 and F2 to eliminate r and k.

F1 / F2 = [ |q1 q2| ] / [ ( (q1 + q2)^2 ) /4 ) ]

=> F1 / F2 = (4 |q1 q2| ) / ( (q1 + q2)^2 )

Let me plug in the values.

0.108 / 0.036 = (4 |q1 q2| ) / ( (q1 + q2)^2 )

Calculating 0.108 / 0.036: 3.

So 3 = (4 |q1 q2| ) / ( (q1 + q2)^2 )

=> 3 (q1 + q2)^2 = 4 |q1 q2|

Now, let's let’s make it in terms of variables. Let me denote q1 = Q, q2 = -q (since one is positive and the other negative, their product is negative, so I can write q2 as -q, where q is positive). Or wait, perhaps I should let q1 = +a and q2 = -b, so that a and b are positive numbers. That might make it easier.

So q1 = a, q2 = -b.

Then, the initial product is q1 q2 = -ab.

The magnitude |q1 q2| is ab.

The total charge after connection is a - b. And each sphere has (a - b)/2.

Then, the new force is repulsion, so F2 is positive, and the product is positive because both charges are positive or both negative. But since the net charge is positive, each has positive charge. So (a - b)/2 is positive, which implies a > b.

So, substituting into the ratio equation:

3 = [4 * ab ] / ( (a - b)^2 )

=> 3 (a - b)^2 = 4 ab

Let me expand (a - b)^2: a² - 2ab + b².

So 3(a² - 2ab + b²) = 4ab

=> 3a² -6ab +3b² =4ab

Bring all terms to one side:

3a² -6ab +3b² -4ab =0

=> 3a² -10ab +3b² =0

Hmm, this is a quadratic in terms of a and b. Let me see if I can factor it.

Let me treat this as a quadratic equation in a, with b as a variable.

3a² -10ab +3b²=0.

Let me use the quadratic formula for a:

a = [10b ± sqrt( (10b)^2 -4*3*3b² ) ] / (2 *3 )

Simplify inside the square root:

(10b)^2 = 100b²

4*3*3b² = 36b²

So sqrt(100b² -36b² )= sqrt(64b² )=8b.

So,

a = [10b ±8b ]/(6)

So two possibilities:

a = (10b +8b)/6 = 18b/6 = 3b.

Or a= (10b-8b)/6 = 2b/6 = b/3.

So a=3b or a= b/3.

But earlier, we have that a > b because (a -b)/2 is positive.

So if a=3b, then a> b, which is okay.

If a= b/3, then a < b, which would make (a -b) negative, so each sphere would have negative charge, but the problem states that the net charge is positive. So this case is invalid because a= b/3 would give a < b, and (a -b) negative, making each sphere's charge negative, which contradicts the given that the net is positive.

So only a=3b is valid.

So a=3b.

Now, substitute back into initial equations.

From equation 1: F1 = k ab / r² = 0.108.

Wait, because F1 is the magnitude, so |q1 q2|= ab.

So 0.108 = (k ab) / r².

We can use this to find ab.

Let me calculate r: 50 cm = 0.5 m.

k is Coulomb's constant, 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So,

ab = (0.108 * r² ) / k

Plugging in the numbers:

r² = (0.5)^2 = 0.25 m².

ab = (0.108 * 0.25) / (8.988e9 )

Calculate numerator: 0.108 * 0.25 = 0.027.

So ab = 0.027 / 8.988e9 = approx 3.002e-12 C². Hmm, but let's compute it more accurately.

Wait, 0.027 / 8.988e9 = 0.027 / 8988000000 = approx 3.002e-12.

But let's write it as exact fractions.

Wait, 0.108 is 27/250.

0.25 is 1/4.

So:

ab = ( (27/250) * (1/4) ) / (8.988e9 )

= (27/(250*4)) / 8.988e9

= (27/1000) / 8.988e9 = 27/(1000 *8.988e9 )

= 27/(8.988e12 )

27 divided by 8.988e12 is approximately 3e-12.

But perhaps I can write it as 3e-12 C².

Wait, 27 / 8.988 is approximately 3, so 3e-12.

So ab =3e-12 C².

But since a=3b, let's substitute a=3b into ab=3e-12.

So 3b * b =3e-12 → 3b²=3e-12 → b²=1e-12 → b=1e-6 C.

Wait, 1e-6 is 1 microcoulomb.

So b=1e-6 C → 1 μC.

Then a=3b=3e-6 C → 3 μC.

So the initial charges are q1=+3 μC and q2=-1 μC.

But wait, the question asks for the negative charge on one of them. So the negative charge is q2=-1 μC. But looking at the options, option C is -0.5, F is -1.0, etc.

Wait, let me check my calculation again.

Wait, I said ab=3e-12 C². Because a=3b, so 3b * b =3b²=3e-12 → b²=1e-12 → b=1e-6 C.

So q2 is -1e-6 C, which is -1 μC. Looking at the options, option F is -1.00 μC. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Let me recap:

We had two cases where a=3b and a=b/3. We dismissed a=b/3 because it led to negative net charge, which contradicts the problem statement. So a=3b is correct.

Then, substituting into ab=3e-12, we get b=1e-6 C, so the negative charge is -1e-6 C → -1 μC, which is option F.

Yes, that makes sense. So the negative charge on one of them is -1.00 μC.

To solve the problem, we analyze the two scenarios involving the charges on the spheres:

1. **Initial State**: The spheres attract each other, so one is positively charged and the other is negatively charged. Let the charges be \( q_1 = a \) (positive) and \( q_2 = -b \) (negative), where \( a \) and \( b \) are positive magnitudes. The electrostatic force between them is given by Coulomb's law:

   \[
   F_1 = k \frac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2} = 0.108 \, \mathrm{N}.
   \]

   Substituting \( |q_1 q_2| = ab \), we have:

   \[
   0.108 = k \frac{ab}{r^2}.
   \]

2. **After Connection**: When the spheres are connected by a thin wire, their charges redistribute evenly because they are identical conductors. The total charge becomes \( q_1 + q_2 = a - b \), and each sphere has a charge of:

   \[
   \frac{a - b}{2}.
   \]

   After the wire is removed, the spheres repel each other, so the new force is:

   \[
   F_2 = k \frac{\left(\frac{a - b}{2}\right)^2}{r^2} = 0.0360 \, \mathrm{N}.
   \]

   Substituting this into Coulomb's law:

   \[
   0.0360 = k \frac{\left(\frac{a - b}{2}\right)^2}{r^2}.
   \]

3. **Force Ratio**: Taking the ratio of \( F_1 \) and \( F_2 \) to eliminate \( k \) and \( r^2 \):

   \[
   \frac{F_1}{F_2} = \frac{\frac{k \frac{ab}{r^2}}}{\frac{k \frac{\left(\frac{a - b}{2}\right)^2}{r^2}}} = \frac{4ab}{(a - b)^2}.
   \]

   Substituting \( \frac{F_1}{F_2} = \frac{0.108}{0.0360} = 3 \):

   \[
   3 = \frac{4ab}{(a - b)^2}.
   \]

   Simplifying:

   \[
   3(a - b)^2 = 4ab.
   \]

   Expanding \( (a - b)^2 \):

   \[
   3(a^2 - 2ab + b^2) = 4ab.
   \]

   Rearranging:

   \[
   3a^2 - 10ab + 3b^2 = 0.
   \]

4. **Solving for \( a \) and \( b \)**: Treating this as a quadratic equation in \( a \), we solve for \( a \) in terms of \( b \):

   \[
   a = \frac{10b \pm \sqrt{(10b)^2 - 4(3)(3b^2)}}{2(3)} = \frac{10b \pm 8b}{6}.
   \]

   This gives two solutions:

   \[
   a = 3b \quad \text{or} \quad a = \frac{b}{3}.
   \]

   Since the spheres repel after connection, the total charge \( a - b \) must be positive, implying \( a > b \). Thus, \( a = \frac{b}{3} \) is invalid, and we use \( a = 3b \).

5. **Substituting \( a = 3b \)**: Using the initial force equation:

   \[
   0.108 = k \frac{ab}{r^2}.
   \]

   Substituting \( a = 3b \) and \( r = 0.5 \, \mathrm{m} \):

   \[
   ab = (3b)(b) = 3b^2.
   \]

   \[
   0.108 = k \frac{3b^2}{(0.5)^2}.
   \]

   Solving for \( b^2 \):

   \[
   b^2 = \frac{0.108 \cdot (0.5)^2}{3k}.
   \]

   Using \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \mathrm{N \cdot m^2 / C^2} \):

   \[
   b^2 = \frac{0.108 \cdot 0.25}{3 \cdot 8.988 \times 10^9} = \frac{0.027}{2.6964 \times 10^{10}} \approx 1 \times 10^{-12}.
   \]

   \[
   b = \sqrt{1 \times 10^{-12}} = 1 \, \mu\mathrm{C}.
   \]

   Thus, \( a = 3b = 3 \, \mu\mathrm{C} \).

6. **Conclusion**: The negative charge on one of the spheres is \( q_2 = -b = -1 \, \mu\mathrm{C} \).

The correct answer is:

**F: \(-1.00 \, \mu\mathrm{C}\)**.
