Okay, so I've got this ethics question about a therapist receiving a letter from an Ethics Committee. The situation is that a former client has filed a complaint against her current therapist, and the committee is asking for information about this client. The therapist in question stopped seeing this client over seven years ago. The question is about what the therapist should do in response.

First, I need to understand the ethical guidelines that apply here. I remember that therapists have a duty of confidentiality, which is a big part of their ethical obligations. But there are exceptions, right? Like when there's a court order or when the client consents. Also, sometimes state laws or professional boards can require information under certain circumstances.

The options are A through H. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A says to cooperate by sending the client's file. But I think just sending the file without any checks might not be right. Confidentiality is a big deal, so maybe the therapist needs to verify something first, like client consent or a proper release.

Option B suggests telling the committee the info is obsolete and can't be released. I'm not sure if the age of the information matters ethically. The duty of confidentiality usually doesn't expire just because time has passed. So maybe B isn't the best choice.

Option C is ignoring the request. That seems unprofessional and maybe even unethical because the committee might have a legitimate reason for asking. Ignoring doesn't seem like the right approach.

Option D is about cooperating without verification. That sounds risky because it could breach confidentiality. The therapist should probably ensure they have the right to release the information.

Option E says to send relevant info after confirming the client signed a release. That makes sense because it respects confidentiality. The client's consent would typically be needed unless there's another valid reason to disclose without it.

Option F is sending info without consent. That would probably violate confidentiality unless there's an exception, like a legal requirement. The question doesn't mention a subpoena or court order, so F might not be appropriate.

Option G is refusing to cooperate because of privacy. While privacy is important, sometimes ethical committees have oversight authority, so a blanket refusal might not be correct. There might be a way to provide info without breaching confidentiality.

Option H says the file was deleted. If the therapist deleted the file after seven years, that's probably okay as per retention policies, but the question is about whether to provide info, not whether the file exists. So H might not be the main issue here.

So the key points are confidentiality, the need for client consent, and responding appropriately to the Ethics Committee. The therapist should check if the client has given consent or a release. If so, they can provide relevant information. If not, they might need to see if there's another basis to disclose, but the question doesn't provide that.

Looking back, option E seems correct because it involves confirming the client's release before sending relevant info. That way, confidentiality is respected, and the therapist cooperates appropriately with the committee.

The correct answer is E. The therapist should cooperate with the Ethics Committee by sending relevant information after confirming that the client has signed a release, ensuring confidentiality is respected.
