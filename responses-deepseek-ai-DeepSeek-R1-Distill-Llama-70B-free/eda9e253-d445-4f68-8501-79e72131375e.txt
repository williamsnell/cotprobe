Question:

Congress enacted a statute designed to make the stabilization of rents more effective throughout the United States. The statute will be applicable to all leasehold contracts hereafter entered into between landlords and tenants involving residential and commercial properties. The new federal statute is intended to protect tenants from spiraling rents and "profiteering" by landlords without curtailing the supply of rental units or depriving landlords of substantial constitutional rights. The new federal statute would be most clearly constitutional as applied to

Options:

A: the rental of a vacation home by an individual landlord to a family on a short-term lease.
B: the rental of a state-owned office building by a state to a privately owned business.
C: the rental of a college dormitory by a private university to its students.
D: the rental of residential property located in the District of Columbia by an individual landlord to a family of six.
E: the rental of an office building to a city by an individual landlord.

Okay, so I have this question about constitutional law, specifically dealing with Congress's power to enact a statute related to rent stabilization. Hmm, I remember that Congress has certain powers under the Constitution, like the Commerce Clause, which allows them to regulate activities that affect interstate commerce. 

The question says that Congress passed a statute to make rent stabilization more effective nationwide. It applies to all future lease contracts between landlords and tenants for residential and commercial properties. The purpose is to protect tenants from high rents and landlord profiteering, without reducing the number of rental units or infringing on landlords' constitutional rights. So the question is asking under which option this statute would most clearly be constitutional.

Let me look at the options:

Option A: Rental of a vacation home by an individual landlord to a family on a short-term lease. So this is a private transaction between two individuals. I think whether this involves interstate commerce depends on the circumstances. If the vacation home is in another state, maybe it's affecting interstate commerce. But vacation homes are typically for personal use, so maybe not a major commerce aspect. Not sure yet.

Option B: Rental of a state-owned office building by a state to a private business. Wait, states are sovereign entities. If the state owns the building and is leasing it, does that fall under state sovereignty? I recall that the state can't be compelled by federal law in certain matters because of the 10th Amendment. Unless it's involving interstate commerce. But the state is acting as a landlord here. Not sure if the Commerce Clause would apply because it's a state-owned property, which might be a government function.

Option C: Rental of a college dormitory by a private university to its students. Private universities are not state actors, so federal laws can apply to them. But dorms are usually for students, and perhaps a very specific, local situation. If the university is involved in interstate commerce, maybe. But this could be more of a local matter. The question is whether Congress has the authority under the Commerce Clause to regulate this. If the dorm's rental doesn't have a substantial effect on interstate commerce, maybe not. But if the university is large or has out-of-state students, perhaps it does.

Option D: Rental of residential property in D.C. by an individual landlord to a family. The District of Columbia is a federal enclave, so Congress has direct authority over it under Article I, Section 8, Clause 17 (the Enclave Clause). So any federal law applies there without needing to rely on powers like the Commerce Clause. Therefore, this statute would clearly be constitutional here because Congress has exclusive legislative authority over D.C.

Option E: Rental of an office building to a city by an individual landlord. So the tenant is a city, which is a municipal government. Again, this might involve state or local government, but the landlord is an individual. The question is whether this affects interstate commerce. Office buildings are commercial properties, and if the landlord is engaging in a commercial activity, then the Commerce Clause could apply. But I'm not sure if leasing to a city would fall under this. Also, the city might be considered a market participant, so the federal law could apply if it's regulating economic activity with a substantial effect on commerce.

So, thinking through, the Commerce Clause gives Congress the power to regulate economic activities that have a substantial effect on interstate commerce. Residential and commercial leases could be considered economic activities that, in the aggregate, have such an effect. But when the property is in D.C., Congress doesn't need to rely on the Commerce Clause because of the Enclave Clause. So the statute as applied in D.C. is clearly constitutional.

Options like A and E might depend on whether the activity affects interstate commerce. For example, if the vacation home is rented by out-of-state people, it could have an interstate aspect. But in D, it's straightforward because of Congress's direct authority.

So the correct answer should be D.

The question concerns the constitutionality of a federal rent stabilization statute enacted by Congress. The statute applies to all future lease agreements involving residential and commercial properties nationwide, aiming to protect tenants from spiraling rents and landlord profiteering. The key issue is determining under which scenario the statute would most clearly be constitutional.

- **Option A**: The rental of a vacation home by an individual landlord to a family on a short-term lease involves a private transaction. While it could potentially affect interstate commerce if the property is in another state or rented by out-of-state individuals, such cases are not as clear-cut as other options. The vacation home is typically for personal use, which may limit its connection to interstate commerce.

- **Option B**: The rental of a state-owned office building by a state to a private business raises issues of state sovereignty under the 10th Amendment. States are generally not compelled by federal laws unless the activity has a substantial effect on interstate commerce. However, this scenario involves a state acting as a landlord, which may fall under state sovereignty and make the application of the federal statute less clear.

- **Option C**: The rental of a college dormitory by a private university to its students involves a private institution. While private universities are subject to federal laws, dormitories are typically for specific, localized use (housing students). The connection to interstate commerce may be tenuous unless the university has significant out-of-state activities or students.

- **Option D**: The rental of residential property in the District of Columbia by an individual landlord to a family is the most straightforward case. Congress has exclusive legislative authority over the District of Columbia under Article I, Section 8, Clause 17 (the Enclave Clause). This means the federal statute would clearly be constitutional in this context without needing to rely on the Commerce Clause.

- **Option E**: The rental of an office building to a city by an individual landlord involves a municipal government as the tenant. While office buildings are commercial properties, the application of the federal statute here might depend on whether the activity has a substantial effect on interstate commerce. However, this is less clear compared to the direct authority Congress has over the District of Columbia.

Given the analysis, the federal statute would most clearly be constitutional as applied to **Option D**, as Congress has direct authority over the District of Columbia, making the application of the statute unequivocal under the Enclave Clause.
