Okay, so I've got this problem here about Mrs. Valdez and her bonds. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it slow.

First, the question says she owns six 9 1/8% coupon bonds. Each has a par value of $500. She receives annual interest, and when the interest is due, she clips the coupons and gets payment from her bank. The question is, how much does she receive?

Hmm, I think coupon bonds pay interest annually, right? So each bond pays a certain percentage of its par value each year. The par value is the face value, which is what the bond is worth when it matures. But for the coupon payments, it's based on that par value.

So the coupon rate is 9 1/8%. Let me convert that to a decimal. 1/8 of a percent is 0.125%, so 9.125%. So 9.125% per year. That makes sense.

Each bond has a par value of $500. So the annual interest per bond would be 9.125% of $500. Let me calculate that. 

9.125% as a decimal is 0.09125. So 0.09125 multiplied by 500.

Let me do that math. 0.09125 * 500. Hmm, 0.09 * 500 is 45, and 0.00125 *500 is 0.625. So adding together, 45 + 0.625 is 45.625 dollars per bond per year.

Wait, but she owns six of these bonds. So I need to multiply that per-bond amount by six.

45.625 * 6. Let me compute that. 45 *6 is 270, and 0.625 *6 is 3.75. So 270 +3.75 is 273.75. So that's $273.75 in total interest each year.

Looking at the options, option A is $273.75, which should be the correct answer.

I think that's it. So each bond pays a little over 45 dollars, and six of them make it just over 270, which is option A.

Mrs. Valdez owns six coupon bonds, each with a par value of $500 and a coupon rate of 9 1/8%. To calculate the annual interest she receives, first determine the interest per bond. Converting 9 1/8% to a decimal gives 0.09125. Multiplying this by the par value of $500 yields:

\[
0.09125 \times 500 = 45.625
\]

Since she owns six bonds, the total annual interest is:

\[
45.625 \times 6 = 273.75
\]

Thus, Mrs. Valdez receives $273.75 in total annual interest.
