Okay, so I have this problem where I need to round the population of a city to the nearest ten thousand. The population given is 836,527. Hmm, I remember that rounding to a certain place value involves looking at the digit immediately below that place to decide whether to round up or down.

Wait, the question is about the nearest ten thousand. Let me think. Ten thousand is the fifth digit from the right because each place is thousands, ten thousands, etc. So, in the number 836,527, let's break it down.

The number is 836,527. Breaking it into parts: 800,000 plus 36,527. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 8 is in the hundred thousands place, 3 in the ten thousands, 6 in the thousands, 5 in the hundreds, 2 in the tens, and 7 in the ones. So, the ten thousands place is the digit 3 (the second digit from the left).

Wait, no, wait. Let me write it out. The places are as follows: 

- 8: hundred thousands (100,000)
- 3: ten thousands (10,000)
- 6: thousands (1,000)
- 5: hundreds (100)
- 2: tens (10)
- 7: ones (1)

So the ten thousands digit is 3. The next digit to the right is the thousands place, which is 6. 

When rounding to the nearest ten thousand, I look at the thousands digit. If it's 5 or higher, I round up the ten thousands digit by one. If it's less than 5, I leave the ten thousands digit as it is.

Here, the thousands digit is 6, which is higher than 5. So I round up the ten thousands digit from 3 to 4. That would make the number 840,000 because the digits below the ten thousands place (the thousands, hundreds, tens, ones) all become zero when rounding to that place.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me double-check. So the original number is 836,527. Rounding to the nearest 10,000. The steps are:

1. Identify the ten thousands place: 3 in 836,527.
2. Look at the thousands place: 6.
3. Since 6 >=5, round up the ten thousands place by 1. So 3 becomes 4.
4. All digits below ten thousands become zero. So it's 840,000.

So the correct answer should be 840,000. Now looking at the options:

Options are A:860,000; B:850,000; C:830,000; D:837,000; E:820,000; F:840,000; G:835,000; H:800,000; I:836,500; J:836,000.

So option F is 840,000. That should be the correct answer.

The population of the city is 836,527. To round this to the nearest ten thousand, we look at the ten thousands place (3) and the thousands place (6). Since 6 is greater than or equal to 5, we round the ten thousands digit up by 1, making it 4. This results in 840,000.

The correct answer is F.
