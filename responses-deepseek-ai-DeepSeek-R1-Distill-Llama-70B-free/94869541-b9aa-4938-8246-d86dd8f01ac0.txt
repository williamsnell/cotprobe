Question:

A rider entered a subway car at the 42nd Street station. Because all of the seats were occupied, the rider stood in the subway car and grabbed a pole to secure his balance. As the subway car was proceeding downtown, the rider glanced at a girl standing next to him. Suddenly, the subway car made an unexpected stop. The rider momentarily lost his balance and grabbed the girl around the waist (to avoid falling). Once the rider regained his balance, he removed his hands from the girl's waist and grasped the pole again. In a civil action instituted by the girl against the rider, he will most likely be found

Options:

A: liable, because the rider believed that the girl consented to the contact under the circumstances.
B: not liable, because the rider's actions were unintentional.
C: not liable, because the girl did not express any discomfort at the time of contact.
D: not liable, because the subway's sudden stop was an unforeseeable event.
E: liable, as he should have found another way to secure his balance.
F: liable, because the rider did not apologize for the contact.
G: liable for battery.
H: not liable, because the girl was not harmed by the contact.
I: liable for assault.
J: not liable, because the rider's conduct was socially acceptable under the circumstances.

Okay, so I've got this question about tort law, specifically involving battery and assault. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

So the situation is: a rider gets on a subway car, all the seats are taken, so he stands and holds a pole. Then he looks at a girl next to him. The subway stops suddenly, he loses balance, grabs her waist to avoid falling. Then he regains balance and lets go. The girl sues him. The question is about whether he's liable.

Hmm. I remember that battery is an intentional harmful or offensive touching without consent. Assault is intentional act that causes apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact.

So in this case, the rider grabbed her waist. Was that intentional? Well, he did it on purpose to prevent falling, so yes, it was an intentional act. But wait, was it harmful or offensive? And did he have consent?

Consent is a big factor here. If the touching was done in a way that a reasonable person would find offensive, then it's battery. But maybe in an emergency situation, like a sudden subway stop, people might grab onto each other without explicit consent, and that's socially acceptable.

I think the subway stop was unexpected, so maybe the rider couldn't have anticipated it. But does that matter? Because even if it's an emergency, the intent to touch is still there. But maybe the circumstances make the touching not offensive. Like, it's an instinctive reaction to prevent falling, not meant to harm or offend.

So options: The answer choices are A through J. Let's look at them.

Option A: Liable because he thought she consented. But she didn't express consent, so that's not right.

Option B: Not liable because unintentional. No, because grabbing is intentional, even if the cause was an accident.

Option C: Not liable because she didn't show discomfort. But the tort is about the act, not her reaction necessarily.

Option D: Not liable because subway stop was unforeseeable. Maybe, but the rider's action was still an intentional touching.

Option E: Liable because he should have found another way. But in the moment, maybe he couldn't. Not sure if that's the standard.

Option F: Liable because no apology. Doesn't seem relevant to liability.

Option G: Liable for battery. That's a possibility because it was an intentional touching without consent.

Option H: Not liable because no harm. But battery doesn't require harm, just offensive touching.

Option I: Liable for assault. Wait, assault requires an act that causes apprehension of imminent contact. Did he make a gesture that made her fear imminent contact? Or was the contact itself the battery. So maybe it's battery, not assault.

Option J: Not liable because conduct was socially acceptable. Like, in an emergency, grabbing someone might be seen as acceptable, so no offense.

So the key is whether the touching was offensive. If in that situation, a reasonable person wouldn't find it offensive because it was an emergency, then it's not battery. So the rider might not be liable because the contact wasn't offensive, given the circumstances.

Looking back, the subway car made an unexpected stop. The rider lost balance and grabbed her waist momentarily. Then he let go. It wasn't done in a hostile way, just to prevent falling. So a reasonable person might not find that offensive.

So the correct answer would be not liable because the conduct was socially acceptable under the circumstances, which is option J.

Wait, but another angle: even if socially acceptable, if it's intentional touching without consent, it's still battery. Unless the consent was implied under the circumstances.

But in cases of emergency, courts sometimes find that there's implied consent. Or that the touching isn't considered offensive because it's necessary.

I think that's the case here. So the rider's action would be considered socially acceptable, so no liability. So option J.

The question revolves around whether the rider is liable for battery or assault after grabbing the girl’s waist to regain balance during an unexpected subway stop. Battery requires an intentional, harmful, or offensive touching without consent, while assault involves an act that causes apprehension of imminent harmful or offensive contact. 

The rider’s action of grabbing the girl’s waist was intentional, but the context is crucial. The subway’s sudden stop created an emergency situation where the rider acted instinctively to prevent falling. Such actions in emergency situations are often considered socially acceptable and not inherently offensive. Courts may recognize implied consent in such circumstances, as the touching was not done with hostile intent but out of necessity. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect, as the girl did not explicitly consent.
- **B**: Incorrect, as the act was intentional, even if the cause (subway stop) was unexpected.
- **C**: Incorrect, as liability does not depend on the girl’s reaction.
- **D**: Incorrect, as the rider’s intentional act, not the subway stop, is the focus.
- **E**: Incorrect, as there is no duty to find another way in an emergency.
- **F**: Irrelevant, as an apology does not affect liability.
- **G**: Incorrect, as the touching was not offensive under the circumstances.
- **H**: Incorrect, as battery does not require harm.
- **I**: Incorrect, as assault requires apprehension of contact, which is not alleged here.
- **J**: Correct, as the conduct was socially acceptable in the emergency context.

The rider’s action, though intentional, was socially acceptable under the circumstances, making him not liable. 

Answer: J
