Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the fugacity of carbon dioxide using the reduced Berthelot equation. Hmm, I remember that fugacity is a concept in thermodynamics related to the effective pressure of a real gas. The equation given is z = PV/(RT) = 1 + [9/(128)] times some terms involving the critical temperature and pressure.

Wait, the equation is z = 1 + (9/128) * [P T_c / (P_c T)] * [1 - 6 (T_c^2 / T^2)]. Right, so z is the compressibility factor. Once I find z, I can use it to find the fugacity.

Fugacity f is given by f = P * exp( (1/(RT)) ∫ (z-1) dP ) from 0 to P. But wait, that integral might be tricky. Alternatively, for the Berthelot equation, there might be a simpler expression for the fugacity.

Wait, I think for the Berthelot equation, the fugacity can be expressed as f = P * exp( z-1 - (A/T) (z - B) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe it's better to use the formula for fugacity with the given equation of state.

Alternatively, I remember that for the compressibility factor z, the fugacity coefficient φ is given by ln φ = (1/(RT)) ∫ (V - RT/P) dP evaluated from 0 to P. But since V is related to z, maybe I can express this integral in terms of z.

Wait, let me think again. The Berthelot equation is a cubic equation, and the fugacity calculation might involve integrating the equation. Alternatively, maybe there's a shortcut formula for the fugacity when using the Berthelot equation.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the virial equation approach. The given equation seems to be a form of the virial equation, but I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, the problem says the reduced Berthelot equation. Oh right, the Berthelot equation is an equation of state. The reduced form uses the critical constants.

The equation given is z = 1 + (9/128) * (P T_c)/(P_c T) * [1 - 6 (T_c^2 / T^2)]. So z is a function of pressure and temperature.

Wait, but the z here is the compressibility factor, which is PV/(RT). So for the Berthelot equation, the expression for z is given.

Once I have z, I can find the fugacity. The fugacity coefficient φ is given by ln φ = ∫ (z-1)/P dP from 0 to P, but wait, no, that's when the integral is with respect to P. Wait, no, the fugacity coefficient is given by:

ln φ = ∫ (from 0 to P) (z-1)/P dP.

So I need to compute this integral.

So first, I'll compute z using the given equation, and then plug into this integral.

So let's compute z first.

Given T_c = 304.3 K, P_c =73.0 atm. The given temperature is 150°C, which is 423.15 K. Pressure is 50 atm.

Let me compute each term step by step.

First, compute [P T_c / (P_c T)].

P is 50 atm, T is 423.15 K.

So P T_c = 50 * 304.3 = let's compute that. 50 * 300 is 15,000, 50 * 4.3 is 215, so total is 15,215 atm·K.

P_c T is 73.0 atm * 423.15 K. Let's compute that: 70*423.15 = 29,620.5, 3*423.15=1,269.45. Total 29,620.5 + 1,269.45 = 30,889.95 atm·K.

So the ratio is 15,215 / 30,889.95 ≈ let's calculate that.

Divide numerator and denominator by 5: 3,043 / 6,177.99. Hmm, approximately 0.4926.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately:

15215 ÷ 30889.95.

Let me do the division: 30,889.95 goes into 15,215 about 0.4926 times. So approximately 0.4926.

Next term is [1 - 6 (T_c^2 / T^2)].

Compute T_c^2: (304.3)^2. Let's calculate that.

300^2 is 90,000. 4.3^2 is 18.49. 2*300*4.3 = 2580. So (300+4.3)^2 = 90000 + 2580 + 18.49 = 92598.49.

Wait, wait, 304.3^2: Let me compute it more accurately.

304.3 * 304.3:

Compute 300*300=90,000.

300 *4.3 = 1,290.

4.3 *300=1,290.

4.3 *4.3= 18.49.

So 90,000 + 2*1,290 + 18.49 = 90,000 + 2580 = 92,580 + 18.49 = 92,598.49.

So T_c^2 = 92,598.49 K².

T is 423.15 K. T² is (423.15)^2.

Compute 400^2=160,000. 23.15^2= approx (23^2)=529, 0.15^2=0.0225, and 2*23*0.15=6.9. So 529+6.9+0.0225≈535.9225.

So 423.15^2 = 400^2 + 2*400*23.15 + 23.15^2 = 160,000 + 18,520 + 535.9225 = 179,055.9225 K².

So T_c² / T² = 92,598.49 / 179,055.92.

Compute that: 92,598.49 / 179,055.92 ≈ approx 0.517.

Wait, more accurately:

Let me compute 92,598.49 ÷ 179,055.92.

Divide numerator and denominator by 1,000: 92.59849 / 179.05592 ≈ 0.5173.

So 6*(T_c² / T²) = 6 * 0.5173 ≈ 3.1038.

So 1 - 3.1038 = -2.1038.

Now putting it all together.

z = 1 + (9/128) * [0.4926] * [-2.1038].

Compute (9/128) first. 9/128 is approximately 0.0703125.

Multiply 0.0703125 by 0.4926: 0.0703125 * 0.4926 ≈ 0.03465.

Then multiply by -2.1038: 0.03465 * (-2.1038) ≈ -0.0729.

So z ≈ 1 + (-0.0729) = 0.9271.

Wait, z is about 0.927. So that's the compressibility factor.

Wait, but wait, that seems low. Because at high pressure, gases tend to have higher z. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check the terms.

Wait the [1 -6 (T_c²/T²)] term: is it 1 -6*(T_c / T)^2? Yes, because (T_c^2)/(T^2) = (T_c/T)^2.

So at T=423.15 K, T_c=304.3 K, so T_c / T ≈ 0.717.

So (T_c / T)^2 is about 0.5146.

6*(T_c²/T²) =6 *0.5146≈3.0876.

So 1-3.0876≈-2.0876.

Wait, earlier I had 0.5173, which is close enough.

So that part is correct.

So the product [P T_c/(P_c T)] is 0.4926.

So (9/128) is 0.0703125.

So 0.4926 * (-2.1038) = approximately -1.037.

Wait, no, wait, I think I made a mistake in the order of multiplication.

Wait, the term is (9/128) * (P Tc/(Pc T)) * [1-6 (Tc²/T²)].

So 0.0703125 * 0.4926 = 0.03465.

Then multiply by (-2.1038): 0.03465 * (-2.1038) ≈ -0.0729.

So z = 1 -0.0729 = 0.9271.

So z is approximately 0.927.

Wait, but that's lower than 1. So that would imply that the gas is less compressible than ideal, which is possible for some conditions, but I thought CO2 at high pressure might be more compressible. Hmm.

But maybe that's correct. Let me proceed.

Now, to find the fugacity, I need to compute the fugacity coefficient, φ.

The fugacity coefficient is given by ln φ = ∫ (from 0 to P) (z-1)/P dP.

Wait, but the integral is in terms of P, over the pressure. So I need to express z in terms of P, and integrate.

But given that z is a function of P, as given by the equation, I can write z as a function of P and integrate.

So z = 1 + (9/128) * (P Tc/(Pc T)) * [1 - 6 (Tc² / T²)].

Let me denote the constant terms as A.

Let me compute A = (9/128) * [Tc/(Pc T)] * [1 -6 (Tc²/T²)].

So A is (9/128) * (304.3)/(73.0 * 423.15) ) * [1 -6*(304.3^2)/(423.15^2)].

Wait, but I can compute this A.

Wait, I think I already did some of this earlier.

Wait, let me recalculate A.

Compute [T_c/(P_c T)]: T_c=304.3, P_c=73.0, T=423.15.

So 304.3/(73.0 *423.15) = 304.3/(73 *423.15).

Compute denominator: 73 *423.15 = ?

73 *400=29,200, 73*23.15= approx 73*20=1,460, 73*3.15≈229.95.

So 1,460 + 229.95=1,689.95. So total denominator ≈ 29,200 +1,689.95=30,889.95.

So 304.3 /30,889.95 ≈ 0.009854.

So [Tc/(Pc T)] = 0.009854.

Then multiply by [1-6*(Tc^2/T^2)]: which we found earlier as about -2.1038.

So A = (9/128) * 0.009854 * (-2.1038).

Compute 9/128 ≈0.0703125.

So 0.0703125 * 0.009854 = approx 0.000693.

Then multiply by (-2.1038): 0.000693 * (-2.1038) ≈ -0.001458.

So A ≈ -0.001458.

So z = 1 + A * P.

Because z = 1 + (9/128) * (P Tc/(Pc T)) * [1 - 6 (Tc^2 / T^2)] = 1 + A P.

So z = 1 + A P.

So z-1 = A P.

Then the integrand (z-1)/P = A.

So ln φ = ∫ (from 0 to P) (z-1)/P dP = ∫ A dP (from 0 to P) = A * P.

So ln φ = A * P.

But wait, A is a constant for given T. So yes, that would make the integral straightforward.

So ln φ = A * P.

So then φ = exp(A * P).

Compute A * P: A is -0.001458, P is 50 atm.

So A*P = -0.001458 *50 = -0.0729.

So ln φ = -0.0729.

Thus, φ = exp(-0.0729) ≈?

Compute exp(-0.0729). Since ln(0.93) is about -0.072, exp(-0.0729) would be approximately 0.929.

So φ ≈ 0.929.

Then fugacity f = φ * P.

Because fugacity f = φ * P.

So f = 0.929 * 50 atm = 46.45 atm.

Looking at the options, option B is 46.4 atm, which is very close.

So the answer would be B: 46.4 atm.

To calculate the fugacity of carbon dioxide at 150°C (423.15 K) and 50 atm using the reduced Berthelot equation, the following steps were taken:

1. **Compressibility Factor (z):**  
   The reduced Berthelot equation is given as:  
   \[
   z = 1 + \frac{9}{128} \cdot \frac{P T_c}{P_c T} \cdot \left[ 1 - 6 \cdot \frac{T_c^2}{T^2} \right]
   \]  
   Substituting the given values:
   - \( T_c = 304.3 \, \text{K} \), \( P_c = 73.0 \, \text{atm} \), \( T = 423.15 \, \text{K} \), \( P = 50 \, \text{atm} \),
   - Compute \(\frac{P T_c}{P_c T}\):  
     \[
     \frac{P T_c}{P_c T} = \frac{50 \cdot 304.3}{73.0 \cdot 423.15} \approx 0.4926
     \]
   - Compute \(\frac{T_c^2}{T^2}\):  
     \[
     \frac{T_c^2}{T^2} = \frac{304.3^2}{423.15^2} \approx 0.5173
     \]
   - Compute \(1 - 6 \cdot \frac{T_c^2}{T^2}\):  
     \[
     1 - 6 \cdot 0.5173 \approx -2.1038
     \]
   - Combine terms:  
     \[
     z = 1 + \frac{9}{128} \cdot 0.4926 \cdot (-2.1038) \approx 1 - 0.0729 = 0.9271
     \]

2. **Fugacity Coefficient (\(\phi\)):**  
   The fugacity coefficient is given by:  
   \[
   \ln \phi = \int_0^P \frac{z-1}{P} \, dP
   \]  
   Substituting \(z = 1 + A \cdot P\), where \(A\) is a constant:  
   \[
   A = \frac{9}{128} \cdot \frac{T_c}{P_c T} \cdot \left[ 1 - 6 \cdot \frac{T_c^2}{T^2} \right]
   \]  
   Compute \(A\):  
   \[
   A = \frac{9}{128} \cdot \frac{304.3}{73.0 \cdot 423.15} \cdot (-2.1038) \approx -0.001458
   \]
   Then:  
   \[
   \ln \phi = A \cdot P = -0.001458 \cdot 50 \approx -0.0729
   \]
   Finally:  
   \[
   \phi = \exp(-0.0729) \approx 0.929
   \]

3. **Fugacity (\(f\)):**  
   The fugacity is given by:  
   \[
   f = \phi \cdot P
   \]  
   Substituting \(\phi \approx 0.929\) and \(P = 50 \, \text{atm}\):  
   \[
   f \approx 0.929 \cdot 50 \approx 46.45 \, \text{atm}
   \]

4. **Final Answer:**  
   Comparing with the options, the closest value is **46.4 atm**, which corresponds to **option B**.

**Answer: B**
