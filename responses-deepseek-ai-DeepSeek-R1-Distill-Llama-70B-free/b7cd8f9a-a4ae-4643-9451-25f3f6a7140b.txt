Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again. Umi created a number pattern by adding the same amount each time to get the next number. The pattern starts with 20, 40, 60, 80, and so on. The question is asking what the eighth number in this pattern will be. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, alright. So first, I should understand what kind of pattern this is. The problem says that each number is obtained by adding the same amount each time. That means it's an arithmetic sequence, right? Because in an arithmetic sequence, each term increases by a constant difference, which is called the common difference.

Looking at the numbers given: 20, 40, 60, 80. Let me calculate the differences between them. 40 minus 20 is 20. 60 minus 40 is also 20. 80 minus 60 is again 20. So the common difference here is 20. That makes sense because each time, we're adding 20 to get the next number.

Now, I need to find the eighth term in this sequence. Let me think about how to find the nth term of an arithmetic sequence. The formula for the nth term is a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d, where a_n is the nth term, a_1 is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the term number.

In this case, a_1 is 20, d is 20, and we're looking for the 8th term, so n is 8.

Plugging the numbers into the formula: a_8 = 20 + (8-1)*20. Let's compute that. 8-1 is 7, and 7 times 20 is 140. Then, 20 plus 140 is 160. So the eighth term should be 160.

Wait, but let me double-check. Let's list out the terms to make sure. The first term is 20. Second is 40 (20+20). Third is 60 (40+20). Fourth is 80 (60+20). Fifth would be 100, sixth 120, seventh 140, and eighth 160. Yep, that lines up with what I calculated using the formula.

So looking at the options, option C is 160. That should be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Maybe I should recount the terms. Let's list them out:

Term 1: 20
Term 2: 40
Term 3: 60
Term 4: 80
Term 5: 100
Term 6: 120
Term 7: 140
Term 8: 160

Yes, that's correct. So the eighth term is 160, which is option C.

To determine the eighth number in Umi's pattern, we recognize it as an arithmetic sequence where each term increases by a constant difference. The given sequence is 20, 40, 60, 80, ..., and the common difference \( d \) is 20. The formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:

\[
a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d
\]

Here, \( a_1 = 20 \), \( d = 20 \), and \( n = 8 \). Plugging in the values:

\[
a_8 = 20 + (8-1) \times 20 = 20 + 140 = 160
\]

Listing the terms confirms this result:  
1. \( 20 \)  
2. \( 40 \)  
3. \( 60 \)  
4. \( 80 \)  
5. \( 100 \)  
6. \( 120 \)  
7. \( 140 \)  
8. \( 160 \)  

Thus, the eighth number in the pattern is **160**, which corresponds to option **C**.
