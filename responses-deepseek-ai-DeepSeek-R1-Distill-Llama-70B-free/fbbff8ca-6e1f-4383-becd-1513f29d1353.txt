Okay, so I have this physics problem here about finding the energy stored in the electrostatic field between two concentric conducting spheres. Hmm, I need to think carefully. Let me start by recalling what I know about electrostatic energy and capacitors.

Wait, so the setup is two concentric conducting spheres. The inner one has radius R and the outer one has radius 2R. Both have charges of magnitude Q but opposite signs. So one is +Q and the other is -Q. I remember that for conducting spheres, the charge resides on the surface.

Now, the question is about the energy stored in the electrostatic field between them. I think the energy stored in an electric field is related to the capacitance of the system. Oh right, the energy U is given by U = (1/2) * C * V^2, where C is capacitance and V is the potential difference.

So I need to find the capacitance of this configuration. Concentric spheres form a spherical capacitor. The formula for the capacitance of a spherical capacitor is C = 4πε₀ * [ (R1 * R2) / (R2 - R1) ) ], where R1 is the radius of the inner sphere and R2 is the radius of the outer sphere.

Wait, in this case, the inner sphere has radius R and the outer 2R. So substituting the values: R1 = R, R2 = 2R.

Plugging into the formula: C = 4πε₀ * [ (R * 2R) / (2R - R) ) ] = 4πε₀ * (2R² / R ) = 4πε₀ * 2R. So C = 8πε₀ R.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. Hmm. R1 is R, R2 is 2R. So the product R1 R2 is R * 2R = 2 R². The denominator is R2 - R1 = R. So (2 R²) / R = 2 R. So the capacitance is 4πε₀ * 2 R = 8 π ε₀ R. That seems right.

Okay, so C = 8 π ε₀ R.

Now, next step: the potential difference V between the two spheres. Since the charges are +Q and -Q, the potential on the inner sphere (radius R) would be higher than the outer, assuming Q is positive. Wait, no, actually, the potential is determined by the charge distribution.

Wait, the potential V is related to the charge Q and capacitance C. The formula is V = Q / C. But wait, which charge? Because the system has two charges, but the net charge is zero. But the potential difference is between the two spheres. Let me think. The inner sphere has charge +Q, and the outer has -Q. But when considering the capacitance, the potential difference is the potential of the inner sphere minus the potential of the outer.

Wait, another approach: for a spherical capacitor, the potential on the inner sphere is V1 = k Q1 / R1, and on the outer sphere, V2 = k Q2 / R2. But wait, the outer sphere's potential is due to both charges. Hmm, maybe I should think again.

Alternatively, the potential difference between the inner and outer spheres is V = V1 - V2. Let me compute each.

So, for the inner sphere of radius R, the potential at its surface is V1 = (k Q) / R, where Q is +Q. For the outer sphere, which has charge -Q, the potential at its surface is V2 = (k (-Q)) / (2R).

Wait, but wait another thing. The outer sphere's potential is due to both charges. Because the outer sphere is a conductor, its surface charge is -Q. Wait no, the outer sphere is a conductor, so the charges inside don't contribute beyond its own surface. Wait, no, the electric field inside a conductor is zero. So for the outer sphere, the potential at its surface is due to both the inner sphere and its own charge.

Wait, no, that's not right. The inner sphere has charge +Q, and the outer sphere has charge -Q. Since the outer sphere is conducting, the charges will distribute so that the inner surface of the outer sphere has a charge of -Q, and the outer surface would have zero? No, wait, no, wait, wait.

Wait, no, charges on a conductor reside on the outer surface. Wait, but the outer sphere is a conductor, so any charge on it would reside on its outer surface. However, because the inner sphere has a charge +Q, the outer sphere will have an induced charge of -Q on its inner surface, and to maintain overall charge, the outer sphere's outer surface has charge Q' such that the total charge is -Q (as given). Wait, no, the problem says the charges on the two spheres are both of magnitude Q and opposite in sign. So the inner sphere is +Q, the outer sphere is -Q.

Wait, but for a conducting sphere, the charge resides on the surface. So the inner sphere has charge +Q on its surface. The outer sphere, being a conductor, will have charge -Q on its outer surface. Wait, but the outer sphere is larger, so if the inner sphere is charged +Q, the outer sphere must have -Q on its inner surface to cancel the field inside the conductor, but since the outer sphere's total charge is -Q, that would mean its outer surface has zero? No, that can't be right.

Wait, maybe I should consider the method of charges for concentric conductors. Let me think. The inner sphere has charge +Q. The outer sphere is a conductor, so when placed in the field of +Q, the charges in the outer sphere will rearrange. The inner surface of the outer sphere will have an induced charge of -Q. Since the outer sphere's total charge is -Q, the outer surface must have zero charge. Oh, that makes sense. So the outer sphere's inner surface is -Q, and the outer surface is 0. So the electric field outside the outer sphere is zero.

Wait, but in this problem, the outer sphere has charge -Q. So if the inner sphere is +Q, the outer sphere's inner surface must have -Q, so the outer sphere's outer surface must have zero because the total charge is -Q. So the net charge on the outer sphere is -Q.

But wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me try to model it. The inner sphere has charge +Q. The outer sphere is conducting and has a total charge of -Q. So the charges on the outer sphere: inner surface must be -Q (to cancel the field inside the conductor), so the outer surface must have charge (-Q) - (-Q) = 0. So the outer surface has zero charge.

Therefore, the electric field inside the outer conductor is zero, and the field outside the outer sphere is zero as well because the net charge is zero? No, the outer sphere has a net charge of -Q. Wait, no, wait. The outer sphere's total charge is -Q, but the inner surface has -Q and the outer surface would have (-Q) - (inner surface charge) = 0? Because the outer sphere's inner surface is -Q, the outer surface would have zero? So the total charge on the outer sphere is (-Q) + 0 = -Q. That makes sense.

So the electric field is only present in the region between the two spheres. Because outside the outer sphere, the net charge is -Q (since the outer sphere's outer surface is zero? Wait no, the outer sphere's charge is -Q on inner surface and 0 on outer. So the total charge is -Q. So the electric field outside would be that of a point charge -Q. Hmm, but wait, I thought the field outside a charged conducting sphere is like that of a point charge. So the field outside the outer sphere would be as if all the charge (-Q) is concentrated at the center.

But wait, in this problem, the outer sphere's charge is -Q. So outside, the field is k*(-Q)/r² for r > 2R. But I might not need that for the calculation.

Anyway, back to capacitance. So the capacitance I calculated earlier as 8 π ε₀ R. Let me check that again. The formula for spherical capacitance is C = 4 π ε₀ (R1 R2)/(R2 - R1). So R1 = R, R2 = 2R. So (R)(2R) = 2 R². Divide by (2R - R) = R. So 2R² / R = 2 R. So 4 π ε₀ * 2 R = 8 π ε₀ R. Yes, correct.

So now, to find the potential difference V between the inner and outer spheres. The inner sphere has charge +Q, the outer has -Q.

The potential difference is V = V_inner - V_outer.

The potential on the inner sphere is V_inner = k Q / R. The potential on the outer sphere is V_outer = k (-Q) / (2R). So V = (k Q/R) - [ (-k Q)/(2R) ) ].

Wait, that can't be right. Because the outer sphere's potential is due to both the inner sphere and its own charge. Hmm, perhaps I should approach this differently.

Wait, the potential of the outer sphere is the sum of potentials from all charges. So the outer sphere's potential is the potential due to +Q at the inner sphere plus the potential due to the outer sphere's own charge.

Wait, the outer sphere's own charge is -Q, located on its inner surface. So the potential at the outer sphere's surface due to its own charge is V = k (-Q) / (2R). And the potential at the outer sphere's surface due to the inner sphere's charge is V = k (+Q) / (2R), because the distance from the center to the outer sphere is 2R.

Wait, so the total potential on the outer sphere is V_outer = (k Q) / (2R) + (k (-Q) ) / (2R) ) = 0. That can't be right. Because the outer sphere is a conductor, so it's an equipotential surface. But that would imply V_inner != V_outer, which is correct.

Wait, no, that approach might not be correct. Let me think again. Alternatively, the potential difference between the two spheres is V = (k Q) / R - (k (-Q)) / (2R) ) = (k Q/R) + (k Q)/(2R) ) = (3 k Q) / (2 R).

Wait, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, the capacitance method is more straightforward. Since C = 8 π ε₀ R, and the charge on the inner sphere is Q, then the potential difference V is Q/C.

Wait, but which charge do I take? Because the charges are +Q and -Q. Hmm. The capacitance relates the charge on one plate to the potential difference. So for a capacitor, Q = C V. But in this case, the two spheres have charges +Q and -Q, so the potential difference would be Q/C.

Wait, yes. Because the charges on the two spheres are equal and opposite, the potential difference V is given by V = Q/C. So V = Q / (8 π ε₀ R) = Q/(8 π ε₀ R).

But wait, let me double-check that. The charge on the inner sphere is +Q, so the capacitance is C = 8 π ε₀ R, so V = Q / C = Q/(8 π ε₀ R).

So now, the energy stored is U = (1/2) C V². Let's compute that.

C is 8 π ε₀ R, V is Q/(8 π ε₀ R).

So U = 0.5 * (8 π ε₀ R) * (Q²) / ( (8 π ε₀ R)^2 )

Simplify:

U = 0.5 * 8 π ε₀ R * Q² / (64 π² ε₀² R² )

Let's compute this step by step.

The numerator: 8 π ε₀ R * Q²

Denominator: 64 π² ε₀² R²

So,

U = 0.5 * (8 π ε₀ R Q²) / (64 π² ε₀² R² )

Simplify the constants:

8 / 64 = 1/8

π / π² = 1/π

ε₀ / ε₀² = 1/ε₀

R / R² = 1/R

So,

U = 0.5 * (1/8) * (1/π) * (1/ε₀) * (1/R) * Q²

Wait, wait, maybe I should factor it step by step.

8 / 64 = 1/8.

So numerator: 8 π ε₀ R Q²

Denominator: 64 π² ε₀² R²

So 8/64 = 1/8.

π/π² = 1/π.

ε₀/ε₀² = 1/ε₀.

R/R² = 1/R.

So putting it all together:

(1/8) * (1/π) * (1/ε₀) * (1/R) * Q²

Then the 0.5 multiplier gives:

U = 0.5 * (Q²)/(8 π ε₀ R )

Wait, that's 0.5 * (1/(8 π ε₀ R )) * Q².

Which is (Q²) / (16 π ε₀ R )

Looking at the options, option D is Q²/(16 π ε₀ R), so that's our answer.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.

Alternative approach: Let's compute the energy using another method. The energy stored in the electric field is also given by U = (1/2) ∫ D · E dV. But that's probably more complicated.

Alternatively, I can think about the potential energy when assembling the system. The work done in bringing the charges from infinity.

But perhaps the capacitance method is correct. So let me recap:

C = 8 π ε₀ R.

V = Q / C = Q/(8 π ε₀ R).

U = (1/2) C V² = (1/2) * 8 π ε₀ R * (Q²)/(64 π² ε₀² R² )

Let me compute this again.

8 π ε₀ R * Q² = 8 π ε₀ R Q².

Divide by 64 π² ε₀² R²: 8/(64) = 1/8, π/π² = 1/π, ε₀/ε₀² = 1/ε₀, R/R² = 1/R.

So 8/(64) = 1/8.

So 1/8 * 1/π * 1/ε₀ * 1/R.

Multiply by (1/2) from U = 1/2 C V²:

So (1/2) * (1/8) * (1/(π ε₀ R)) ) * Q².

Which is (1/16) * (Q²)/( π ε₀ R )

So U = Q²/(16 π ε₀ R )

Which matches option D.

To find the energy stored in the electrostatic field between two concentric conducting spheres of radii \( R \) and \( 2R \), with charges \( +Q \) and \( -Q \) respectively, we proceed as follows:

1. **Capacitance of the Spherical Capacitor**:  
   The capacitance \( C \) of a spherical capacitor is given by:  
   \[
   C = 4 \pi \epsilon_0 \frac{R_1 R_2}{R_2 - R_1}
   \]  
   Here, \( R_1 = R \) (inner sphere) and \( R_2 = 2R \) (outer sphere). Substituting these values:  
   \[
   C = 4 \pi \epsilon_0 \frac{R \cdot 2R}{2R - R} = 4 \pi \epsilon_0 \cdot 2R = 8 \pi \epsilon_0 R
   \]

2. **Potential Difference**:  
   The potential difference \( V \) between the two spheres is related to the charge \( Q \) and capacitance \( C \) by:  
   \[
   V = \frac{Q}{C}
   \]  
   Substituting \( C = 8 \pi \epsilon_0 R \):  
   \[
   V = \frac{Q}{8 \pi \epsilon_0 R}
   \]

3. **Energy Stored**:  
   The energy stored in the electrostatic field is given by:  
   \[
   U = \frac{1}{2} C V^2
   \]  
   Substituting \( C = 8 \pi \epsilon_0 R \) and \( V = \frac{Q}{8 \pi \epsilon_0 R} \):  
   \[
   U = \frac{1}{2} \cdot (8 \pi \epsilon_0 R) \cdot \left(\frac{Q}{8 \pi \epsilon_0 R}\right)^2
   \]  
   Simplifying:  
   \[
   U = \frac{1}{2} \cdot (8 \pi \epsilon_0 R) \cdot \frac{Q^2}{64 \pi^2 \epsilon_0^2 R^2}
   \]  
   \[
   U = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{8 \pi \epsilon_0 R \cdot Q^2}{64 \pi^2 \epsilon_0^2 R^2}
   \]  
   \[
   U = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{Q^2}{8 \pi \epsilon_0 R}
   \]  
   \[
   U = \frac{Q^2}{16 \pi \epsilon_0 R}
   \]

Thus, the energy stored in the electrostatic field is \( \frac{Q^2}{16 \pi \epsilon_0 R} \), which corresponds to **Option D**.
