Okay, so I have this question about the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, and I need to figure out the correct answer from the options given. Let me start by recalling what I know about this Act.

I remember that the Agricultural Adjustment Act was part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal programs. The New Deal was all about helping the United States recover from the Great Depression, which affected both urban and rural areas. So, this Act must have been aimed at addressing some of the agricultural issues during that time.

I think the main problem in agriculture during the 1930s was low crop prices and overproduction. Farmers were producing a lot, which led to surpluses, but because of the Depression, people couldn't buy as much, so prices dropped. This made it hard for farmers to make a living. The government wanted to help stabilize the prices.

Wait, how did they plan to do that? I recall something about reducing farm production. Maybe by paying farmers to not plant as much or to kill off excess livestock. That way, the supply would decrease, which would, in theory, raise the prices. But I'm not sure if that's exactly what the Act did.

Another thing I remember is the concept of "parity." Parity refers to the idea of fair prices for farmers, ensuring that they earn as much as they did during a previous period when prices were good, like the early 1900s. So the Act probably introduced measures to achieve parity by adjusting prices relative to costs.

Looking at the options now:

Option A: It was about military food supplies. I don't think that's right. The Act was more about economic support for farmers, not military.

Option B: Prohibited modern farming equipment. That doesn't make sense. The New Deal was about modernization and support, not holding back technology.

Option C: Fixed-rate tax on exports. I don't remember anything about taxes on exports being a focus. It was more about production and prices.

Option D: Introduced parity as a cornerstone. This rings a bell. I think parity was a key concept here, aiming to balance agricultural prices with other economic factors.

Option E: Mandated industrialization of farming. I don't think so. The Act was about adjusting production, not forcing industrial methods.

Option F: Related to urban development. No, it's about agriculture, so this is off.

Option G: Deregulated crop prices and removed government involvement. That's the opposite of what the Act did. It was government intervention, not deregulation.

Option H: Abolished parity. No, the Act introduced it, so this is wrong.

Option I: Aiming to increase production to reduce prices. Wait, that seems contradictory. If they wanted higher prices, increasing production would lower them. So I think this is incorrect. The Act was about reducing production to raise prices.

Option J: Reduced importance of agricultural policy. No, it made agricultural policy more important by establishing new frameworks.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be D: The Agricultural Adjustment Act introduced the concept of parity as a cornerstone. It aimed to raise farm prices by reducing production and ensuring fair prices, which aligns with the parity idea.

The Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933 was a New Deal program designed to address the economic hardships faced by farmers during the Great Depression. It aimed to stabilize farm prices and incomes by reducing agricultural production, which would decrease surpluses and raise prices. A key feature of the Act was the introduction of the concept of "parity," ensuring fair prices for farmers relative to their production costs and historical standards. This made parity a central principle in U.S. agricultural policy.

The correct answer is **D: The Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933 established the concept of parity as a cornerstone of agricultural policy.**

Answer: D
