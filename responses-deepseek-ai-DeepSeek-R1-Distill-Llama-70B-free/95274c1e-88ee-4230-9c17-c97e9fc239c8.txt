Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Hmm, let's see what it's about. Oh right, it's about determining the force on each side of a coil. I remember that this has something to do with electromagnetic force, probably using the formula related to magnetic flux and current.

The question gives me a few parameters: the coil has 40 turns, carries a current of 15 amps. The axial length is 10 inches, and the flux density is 20,000 lines per square inch. Oh wait, and the conductors are at right angles to the flux. Also, there's a conversion factor from dynes to pounds: 4.448e5 dynes in a pound.

I think the key formula here is the one for magnetic force, which is F = (I * N * B * A * sinθ). But wait, I'm a bit confused. What's each term here? Let me break it down.

Wait, alternatively, I remember another formula: Force F equals the product of the number of turns (N), current (I), magnetic flux (Φ), and maybe the area? Or wait, maybe it's F = I * N * B * L, where L is the length. Because when the conductors are at right angles, the sine of 90 degrees is 1, so that term drops out.

Oh right, the formula for force on a conductor in a magnetic field is F = I * L × B. But since the conductors are perpendicular, the cross product simplifies to I * L * B. But wait, for a single conductor, the force would be F = I * L * B, but since each turn has two sides, maybe the number of conductors is involved?

Wait, the coil has multiple turns, so each turn has two sides (so 40 turns would have 80 conductors in series?), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the formula for a coil is F = (N * I) * (B * A). But wait, the area here is the area through which the flux is passing, but if the length is given as 10 inches, perhaps that's the length of the conductors?

Wait, let me think again. The formula for the force on a current-carrying conductor in a magnetic field is F = I * (L × B). When the conductor is perpendicular, it's F = I * L * B. But that's for a single straight conductor. Now, if the conductor is in a coil, then each side of the coil (each loop) would contribute.

But wait, the problem says the axial length is 10 inches. Axial length probably refers to the length of the coil, which is the same as the length of each conductor in the direction of the current. So each conductor's length is 10 inches.

So considering one side of the coil, if each turn has two sides, but the force on each side is what we need. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think of it as each side of the entire coil. The coil has a certain number of turns, N, and each turn has a current I. So the force on each side would be F = (N * I) * (B * L), where L is the length of the conductor (10 inches) and B is the flux density (20,000 lines/inch²).

Wait, wait, but flux density B is given as 20,000 lines per square inch. Oh, but wait, the unit for flux density is typically in tesla (SI) or gauss (cgs). Since this is in lines per square inch, that's gauss (1 tesla = 10^4 gauss). So 20,000 lines/inch² is 20,000 gauss? Or wait, wait, 1 tesla is 10^4 gauss, and 1 gauss is 1 maxwell/cm². Wait, but I think in the formula, the unit conversion will matter.

Wait, but the formula might be expressed in a way that uses these units directly, or perhaps requires conversion.

Wait, I should probably get the formula right. The force on a current-carrying conductor in a magnetic field is given by F = I * (L × B). Since the length is perpendicular, F = I * L * B.

But wait, that's for a single conductor. Now, in a coil with N turns, the total current linked with the magnetic field would be N * I, so the force would be F = N * I * L * B.

Wait, is that correct? Let me think about units. Let's see: current in amperes, length in inches, flux density in lines per square inch.

Wait, but wait, the formula for force in the SI system would be F in Newtons = I (A) * L (m) * B (T). But here, the units are different: inches and lines per square inch.

Hmm, perhaps I should convert the flux density into Tesla first. Let's see: 1 Tesla is 10^4 Gauss, right? And 1 Gauss is 1 maxwell/cm². Oh wait, but the flux density here is given in lines per square inch. So 1 line is a maxwell, so flux density B is 20,000 maxwell per square inch.

Wait, to convert to Tesla, I need to convert the area. 1 square inch is (2.54 cm)^2 = 6.4516 cm². So 20,000 lines per in² equals 20,000 / 6.4516 ≈ 3,099.6 lines per cm². Since 1 Tesla is 10^4 lines/cm², so 3,099.6 / 1e4 ≈ 0.30996 Tesla.

But wait, maybe it's easier to work with the given units and use the conversion factor at the end. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula that uses these units without needing to convert to SI.

Wait, another thought: the force in dynes would be F = N * I * L * B, but wait, what's B in units that make sense. Let me think about the units again.

Wait, in the cgs system, the unit for B is Gauss (which is lines per cm²). So 1 Gauss = 1 maxwell/cm². So if B is given as 20,000 lines per square inch, I need to convert that to Gauss (lines per cm²).

So, 1 inch is 2.54 cm. So 1 square inch is (2.54)^2 cm² = 6.4516 cm². So 20,000 lines per square inch is 20,000 / 6.4516 ≈ 3,099.6 lines per cm², which is 3,099.6 Gauss.

Now, in cgs units, the formula for force is F (dynes) = I (amps) * L (cm) * B (Gauss) * N (number of turns).

Wait, but wait, in cgs units, the formula for the force on a conductor is F = I * L × B, but with all terms in cgs. So F in dynes is (I in amps) * (L in cm) * (B in Gauss) * sin(theta), which here is 1 because they're perpendicular.

So in this case, F = N * I * L (cm) * B (Gauss).

Wait, but wait, the length given is 10 inches. So I need to convert that to cm. 10 inches * 2.54 cm/inch = 25.4 cm.

So putting it all together:

N = 40 turns.

I = 15 A.

L = 25.4 cm.

B = 20,000 lines per square inch → 3099.6 Gauss.

So F = 40 * 15 * 25.4 * 3099.6.

Wait, that seems like a big number, but let's compute it step by step.

First, compute 40 *15 = 600.

Then, 600 *25.4 = 600 *25.4. Let's calculate that: 600 *25 = 15,000; 600 *0.4=240 → total 15,240.

Then, 15,240 * 3099.6 = Hmm, that's a huge number. Wait, but the force is in dynes, right?

Wait, that's 15,240 * 3,099.6 ≈ 15,240 * 3,000 = 45,720,000. But wait, let me actually calculate it more accurately.

Wait, 15,240 * 3099.6 = ?

Well, 15,240 * 3,000 = 45,720,000.

15,240 * 99.6 = ?

Wait, 15,240 * 100 = 1,524,000.

So subtract 15,240 * 0.4= 6,096.

So 1,524,000 - 6,096 = 1,517,904.

So total F = 45,720,000 + 1,517,904 = 47,237,904 dynes.

But wait, the question says there are 4.448e5 dynes in a pound. So to convert dynes to pounds, we divide by 4.448e5.

So F in pounds = 47,237,904 / (4.448e5) = ?

Let me compute that: 47,237,904 / 444,800.

Wait, 444800 goes into 47 million about how many times?

444800 * 100 = 44,480,000.

47,237,904 - 44,480,000 = 2,757,904.

444800 * 6 = 2,668,800.

2,757,904 - 2,668,800 = 89,104.

444800 * 0.2 = approx 88,960.

So 100 +6 +0.2 = 106.2. Approximately.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

Compute 47,237,904 / 444800.

Well, 444800 is 4.448e5.

So 47,237,904 / 4.448e5 = (47,237,904 / 4.448) / 1e5 / 1e5? Wait, perhaps using exponents.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute 47,237,904 ÷ 444800.

Let me write it as 47,237,904 ÷ 444,800 = ?

I can simplify both by dividing numerator and denominator by 16.

444800 ÷16 = 27794, wait, 444800 ÷16 is 27794? Wait 16 * 27794 = 444,704. Close to 444,800 but not exact. Hmm, perhaps a better approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write this as:

Approximately 47,237,904 ÷ 444,800 ≈ 47,237,904 ÷ (4.448e5) = (47,237,904 / 1e5) / 4.448 = 472.37904 / 4.448 ≈ ?

Compute 472.37904 ÷ 4.448.

4.448 * 100 = 444.8.

472.379 - 444.8 = 27.579 left.

27.579 / 4.448 ≈ about 6.2.

So 100 + 6.2 = 106.2 pounds.

Wait, but wait, that's the total force. But the question is asking for the force on each side of the coil. Hmm, each side? So perhaps I need to account for the number of sides.

Wait, the coil has two sides, each contributing to the force. Or is the force per side?

Wait, no, in a coil, each turn has two sides, but the force on each side would be the total force divided by two? Because each turn's two sides contribute to the same direction.

Wait, no, maybe not. Let me think: when a current-carrying conductor is placed in a magnetic field, each side of the loop experiences a force in opposite directions. But for a coil with N turns, the total force would be F_total = N * I * L * B.

Wait, but wait, maybe the formula I used already accounts for all the turns, so the force on each side would be F = F_total / 2. Because each turn has two sides, each experiencing a force F_side.

Wait, no, because when you have N turns, each turn contributes a force of I * L * B on each of its two sides, but that's for each loop. Wait, no, perhaps each turn's two sides are in opposite directions, so their forces add up. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that the total force on the coil is F = N * I * L * B. Then, since each side of the coil (assuming two sides per loop) would have that force. Wait, but each loop has two sides, but the direction is such that the forces add up. So for the entire coil, the force is F = N * I * L * B.

But the question is about the force on each side of the coil. Wait, what's meant by each side? The coil has a length L; perhaps each side refers to the two ends of the coil. So the total force would be acting on both ends, so each end experiences half the total force.

Wait, that doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, each side (as in each loop's side) would experience the same force, so the total force is the sum of all the individual forces.

Wait, perhaps I got the initial approach wrong. Maybe each conductor in the coil contributes a force, and the total force is the sum of all conductors.

Wait, but each turn has two conductors (the two sides), so the total number of conductors is 2*N. Each conductor has a force F_cond = I * L * B.

So for each conductor, F_cond = I * L * B. Then, total F = 2*N * I * L * B.

Wait, but that's different from what I had earlier. So which is correct?

Wait, considering a single loop: when current flows, each of the two sides experiences a force in opposite directions. But when you have multiple loops, the forces add up. So for N loops, each side of the loop would have a force of N * I * L * B. But wait, no, maybe the total force is N times the force on one loop.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is F = N * (I * L * B), because each loop contributes I * L * B, and there are N loops, all in the same direction, so the forces add up. So the total force is F = N * I * L * B.

In that case, the force on each side of the coil would require knowing how many conductors (sides) there are. But the problem states that the coil has 40 turns, and each turn has two sides, so 80 conductors. But in the formula, each turn contributes once, not twice.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is F = (N * I) * (B * A), where A is the area. But wait, the area here would be the cross-sectional area of the coil. But the problem gives the axial length as 10 inches, which I think is the length of the conductor, not the area.

Wait, perhaps the force per conductor is F = I * L * B, so the total force for all conductors is F_total = (number_of_conductors) * I * L * B.

Each turn has two conductors (the two sides), so number_of_conductors = 2 * N = 80.

So F_total = 80 * I * L * B.

But wait, no, that would be if each conductor is in series. But in reality, the conductors are in parallel, so the current is the same through each conductor, but the number of conductors would affect the total force.

Wait, no, perhaps each of the two conductors (per loop) experiences the same force, so for N loops, each with two conductors, the total force is F = 2 * N * I * L * B.

Wait, but that would be for all the conductors. But in the problem, the question is about the force on each side of the coil. So each side is a conductor, so if there are 80 conductors, each with force F_cond, but that's not matching the multiple-choice options.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is F = (N * I) * (B * L), which is the same as I had earlier. So F = 40 * 15 * (20,000 lines/in²) * 10 in. But wait, that would have units of amp * (lines/in²) * inches. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused between different formulas. Let's try a different approach.

I remember that the force on a current-carrying conductor is given by F = I * L × B. Since the conductors are at right angles, F = I * L * B.

But in this case, the conductor is part of a coil with N turns, so the total current is N * I? Or is the current per conductor I, so the total force is N * (I * L * B)?

Wait, perhaps it's the latter. So F = N * I * L * B.

But wait, let's think in terms of the units again. So I'm given that B is 20,000 lines per square inch, L is 10 inches, I is 15 amps, N is 40.

So F = 40 * 15 * 10 * 20,000.

Wait, that gives F = 40 *15 = 600; 600 *10=6,000; 6,000 *20,000 = 120,000,000. But what unit is this? Because B is in lines per square inch, L in inches, I in amps, N is unitless.

Wait, in cgs units, the formula for F in dynes is F = I (amps) * L (cm) * B (Gauss). But wait, in this case, I used L in inches. So perhaps I need to convert L to cm first.

So L is 10 inches = 25.4 cm. B is 20,000 lines per square inch, which is 3,099.6 Gauss.

So F would be I * L (cm) * B (Gauss) * N.

So F = 15 * 25.4 * 3,099.6 * 40.

Wait, let me compute that.

Compute 15 * 25.4 = 381.

381 * 3,099.6 ≈ Let's see, 380 * 3,000 = 1,140,000. Then, 1 * 3,099.6 = 3,
