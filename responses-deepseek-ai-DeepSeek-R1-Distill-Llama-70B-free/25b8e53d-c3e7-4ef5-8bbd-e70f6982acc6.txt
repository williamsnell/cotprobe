Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about privatization's impact on the relationship between companies and their managers, according to Mulholland (1998). Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I remember that privatization generally means transferring ownership from the public sector (like the government) to the private sector. So when a company is privatized, it's no longer state-owned but instead owned by private individuals or shareholders.

Now, the question is about how this change affected the relationship between companies and their managers. I need to think about what changes occur when a company is privatized. Well, in the public sector, managers might have different accountability structures. They might be more accountable to the government or the public, whereas in the private sector, they're accountable to shareholders who are interested in profits.

Wait, so in a privatized company, the managers are now more directly responsible to shareholders. Shareholders typically want to see profits and efficient management, so managers might have more pressure to perform. Also, privatization can lead to more efficiency because managers have more autonomy but also more accountability.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. 

Option A: The relationship became more formalized. I'm not sure about that. Maybe, but I don't recall that being the main point.

Option B: Ownership transferred from small shareholders to senior managers. Wait, no, privatization usually involves selling shares to the public or to other companies, not transferring to managers specifically. Unless it's management buyout, but that's not the general case.

Option C: The state has greater control. No, privatization reduces state control because the company is now private.

Option D: Managers became less accountable to shareholders. That doesn't sound right. In privatized companies, managers are more accountable to shareholders because the focus shifts to profitability.

Option E: Increase in small shareholders. Maybe, but the question is about the relationship between companies and managers, not the number of shareholders.

Option F: Decrease in employees. Not necessarily, though privatization can lead to layoffs sometimes, but that's not directly about the manager-company relationship.

Option G: Flexibility reduced with daily worksheets. I don't think that's a main point of privatization. It's more about ownership and accountability.

Option H: Employment based on performance rather than trust. Oh, this sounds familiar. Privatization often brings a more performance-based culture. Managers might have to rely on measurable outcomes rather than just trust or loyalty.

Option I: Shift in power to employees. No, that doesn't fit. Privatization tends to increase managerial power or accountability, not shift to employees.

Option J: Role of managers unchanged. That's unlikely, since privatization usually brings significant changes in management's role and accountability.

So, putting it all together, the key point is that under privatization, managers are more accountable and decisions are based on performance metrics. So the relationship becomes more performance-oriented rather than based on trust or other factors.

Looking back at the options, option H says employment depended on performance rather than trust and commitment. That aligns with what I was thinking. So the answer should be H.

The correct answer is H. Privatization typically leads to a shift where employment and managerial accountability are based more on performance metrics rather than trust or commitment, as managers become more accountable to shareholders focused on profitability.
