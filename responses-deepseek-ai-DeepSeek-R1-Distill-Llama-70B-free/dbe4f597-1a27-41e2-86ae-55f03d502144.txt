Question:

A landlord, an owner in fee simple, leased a three- story house to a tenant for a term of 10 years. By the terms of the lease, the tenant expressly covenanted to pay a monthly rental of $300 and to pay the taxes on the premises during the term of the lease. The lease also stipulated that the tenant, as lessee, may not assign or sublease the said premises. The tenant and his family lived in the house for two years. Then the tenant, still owing the landlord three months back rent, assigned his leasehold interest in the property to a student, who was unaware of the prohibition against assignments. This written assignment expressly provided that the student would pay the landlord the monthly rental of $300, but was silent concerning the payment of taxes. The landlord never objected to this assignment. Six months after the assignment, the landlord conveyed his property interest in the premises to a new owner. The student failed to pay the taxes on the property. The new owner, after paying the taxes, brought suit against the student for the amount paid. Judgment should be for

Options:

A: the student, because the new owner should have notified him about the taxes.
B: the new owner.
C: the landlord, because he never objected to the assignment.
D: the student, because he was not aware of the original lease agreement.
E: the new owner, because the student was not part of the original lease agreement.
F: the student, because the covenant to pay taxes will not "run with the land," unless the intent is clearly expressed in the original lease.
G: the tenant, because he was the one who originally agreed to pay the taxes.
H: the student, because he did not contract with the tenant to pay the taxes on the property.
I: the student, because the covenant to pay taxes is merely collateral and does not "run with the land. "

Okay, so I have this legal question about landlord-tenant law, specifically dealing with lease agreements, assignments, and covenants running with the land. Hmm, I need to figure out who is liable for paying the taxes after an assignment and a change in ownership. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the setup: A landlord leased a house to a tenant for 10 years. The lease says the tenant must pay $300 monthly rent and pay the taxes during the lease. It also prohibits the tenant from assigning or subleasing without permission. So the tenant lived there for two years, then assigned the lease to a student despite owing back rent. The assignment was in writing, the student agreed to pay the $300 rent but didn't mention taxes. The landlord didn't object to this assignment.

Then, six months later, the landlord sold the property to a new owner. The student didn't pay the taxes, and the new owner had to pay them. Now the new owner is suing the student for reimbursement.

The question is whether the new owner can get the money from the student or if someone else is liable.

Let me recall what I know. When a tenant assigns a lease, the assignee (here, the student) typically takes on the obligations of the lease, but this depends on the lease terms and whether the assignment is allowed. The original lease here prohibited assignment, so the tenant might have violated the lease by assigning without permission. But the landlord didn't object, which might mean he accepted the assignment, making the student the new tenant.

Wait, but in some cases, if the landlord doesn't object, the assignment might be considered accepted, so the student becomes responsible for the lease terms. But does that include all the covenants, like paying taxes?

The lease had a covenant to pay taxes. Generally, covenants can be either real or personal. For a covenant to "run with the land" (i.e., bind successors), certain conditions must be met. There's the horizontal privity for the original lease and vertical privity for assignments. Also, the covenant must touch and concern the land, and the parties must have intended it to run.

In the original lease, the tenant covenanted to pay taxes. Assigning the leaseâ€”the student steps into the tenant's shoes, so the student would be responsible for all the terms, unless the lease says otherwise. The assignment was silent on taxes, but does that matter?

Wait, the assignment only mentions paying the $300 rent. But the original lease required paying taxes. If the lease prohibits assignment, but the landlord doesn't object, does that mean the assignment is valid, and the student is bound by all original terms? Or does the student only have to abide by what's in the assignment agreement?

I think that when the tenant assigns the lease, the assignee (student) takes the lease subject to all its terms. So even if the assignment doesn't mention taxes, the student is still obligated because the original lease requires it. Because the student is now the tenant under the lease, they have to perform all the covenants, including paying taxes.

But wait, the lease was assigned, so the student is the new lessee. The new owner, as the new landlord, can enforce the terms of the lease against the student. So the student is responsible for paying taxes as per the original lease.

But some might argue that the covenant to pay taxes is a personal covenant. However, paying taxes is a covenant that touches and concerns the land because it's about the property's maintenance. So it's likely to run with the land.

Another point: the original lease said the tenant could not assign without permission. The tenant did assign, but the landlord didn't object. So the assignment might be valid, and the student is now the tenant. Therefore, the student must pay the taxes.

Wait, but the student didn't agree to pay taxes in the assignment. Does that matter? No, because the assignment is of the leasehold interest, which includes all the terms of the original lease. So even if the assignment doesn't mention taxes, the student is bound by the original lease's terms.

So the new owner sues the student for the taxes. The student is liable because they're the current tenant under the lease, which requires paying taxes. Therefore, the new owner should win, but let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option B: new owner. But wait, the judgment is against the student, so the owner would get a judgment against the student. So the correct outcome is that the new owner wins.

Wait, the options are about the judgment. The new owner is suing the student. So if the student is liable, the judgment is for the new owner (B) or against the student.

Wait, the options are phrased as "Judgment should be for...". So looking at the options:

Option B says "the new owner." So if the new owner wins, the judgment is for them.

But let me think about the other options. Option F says the student is not liable because the covenant doesn't run unless clearly expressed. The original lease had a clear covenant, so F is incorrect.

Option H says the student didn't contract with the tenant to pay taxes. But the student is now the assignee, so they're bound by the original lease's terms, not just their contract with the tenant.

Wait, perhaps the original lease's tax covenant runs with the land. So the student, as the new tenant, is required to pay the taxes. Therefore, the new owner can collect from the student.

So the new owner should win, which would be option B. Wait, but option B is "the new owner." Wait, no, the options say "Judgment should be for...". So if the new owner is suing the student, and the student is liable, the judgment is for the new owner, so option B is correct.

Wait, but let me look at the options again.

Option F: the student, because the covenant to pay taxes will not "run with the land," unless the intent is clearly expressed in the original lease.

In the original lease, the intent was clearly expressed. The lease said the tenant would pay the taxes, so the covenant does run with the land. Therefore, the student is liable, so the new owner can recover from the student. So the correct judgment is for the new owner against the student, meaning the new owner wins.

So the correct answer is B: the new owner.

Wait, but some might argue that the assignment was prohibited, making it invalid unless the landlord consented. The landlord didn't object, so the assignment is valid, making the student the new tenant.

So yes, the student is liable for the taxes because they're now the tenant under the lease with the new owner.

Alternatively, maybe the student isn't liable because the assignment didn't include the tax covenant. But I think the assignment carries all the terms unless the lease says otherwise.

So the answer should be B.

The question revolves around landlord-tenant law, specifically addressing whether the student, as the assignee of the lease, is liable for paying taxes on the property after the landlord conveyed ownership to a new owner. The original lease required the tenant to pay taxes, prohibited assignment without consent, and was assigned to the student despite this prohibition. The landlord did not object to the assignment, and the student agreed to pay rent but not taxes. The new owner, after paying the taxes, sued the student for reimbursement.

Key points of analysis:

1. **Assignment and Lease Terms**: When a tenant assigns a lease, the assignee (student) generally takes on all the obligations of the original lease, provided the landlord consents or does not object. Here, the landlord did not object, making the assignment valid. As a result, the student is bound by the original lease terms, including the covenant to pay taxes.

2. **Covenant to Pay Taxes**: The original lease explicitly required the tenant to pay taxes, and this covenant "touches and concerns the land," meaning it is likely to run with the land. For a covenant to run with the land, there must be horizontal privity (between the original landlord and tenant) and vertical privity (between the tenant and assignee). These conditions are satisfied here, as the assignment transferred the leasehold interest, and the covenant was clearly expressed in the original lease.

3. **Student's Liability**: Although the assignment agreement was silent on taxes, the student, as the new tenant, is still obligated to fulfill all terms of the original lease. The student's failure to pay taxes makes them liable to the new owner, who had to pay the taxes to preserve the property.

4. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option B**: Correct. The new owner can recover the amount paid for taxes from the student because the covenant to pay taxes runs with the land, and the student, as the assignee, is bound by the original lease terms.
   - **Option F**: Incorrect. The covenant to pay taxes does run with the land because it was clearly expressed in the original lease and touches and concerns the land.
   - **Option H**: Incorrect. The student is bound by the original lease terms, not just the assignment agreement, as the assignment transferred the leasehold interest subject to all its obligations.

Conclusion: The judgment should be for the new owner, as the student is liable for paying the taxes under the terms of the original lease.

Answer: B
