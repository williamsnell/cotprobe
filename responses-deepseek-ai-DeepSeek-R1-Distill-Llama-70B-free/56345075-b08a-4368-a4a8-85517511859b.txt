Question:

A research worker was interested in racial differences in the standard of living of farm operators in the southeastern United States. He used the presence of running water in farm dwellings as a crude index of the standard of living. For each of 31 economic areas in North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia in 1945, he calculated two mea-sures : X = farms operated by nonwhites per 100 white farm operators and Y = percent of farms having running water in dwellings. The fol-lowing values were obtained: \sum X = 1,860\sum Y = 465\sum XY = 23,400 \sum X^2 = 201,600\sum Y^2 = 7,925n = 31 Compute the regression line and the correlation of X and Y.

Options:

A: Y = 18 - 0.05 X, r = - .4867
B: Y = 16 - 0.08 X, r = -0.6000
C: Y = 20 - 0.05 X, r = - .4867
D: Y = 18 - 0.05 X, r = - .4000
E: Y = 20 - 0.07 X, r = -0.5500

Okay, so I've got this statistics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let's take it step by step. The question is about computing a regression line and the correlation between two variables, X and Y. 

First, I'll read the problem again to make sure I understand what's being asked. The researcher is looking at racial differences in the standard of living among farm operators. He's using the presence of running water as an index. For each of 31 economic areas in three states, he calculated X and Y. X is the number of farms operated by nonwhites per 100 white farm operators. Y is the percentage of farms with running water.

The data given are the sums: sum X is 1860, sum Y is 465, sum XY is 23,400, sum X squared is 201,600, sum Y squared is 7,925, and n is 31. I need to compute the regression line and the correlation of X and Y.

Hmm, so I remember that the regression line equation is Y = a + bX, where a is the y-intercept and b is the slope. The correlation coefficient is r. 

To find the regression coefficients, I think I'll need to calculate the mean of X, mean of Y, and then use the formulas for slope b and intercept a. Also, the correlation coefficient r can be calculated using the covariance and the standard deviations of X and Y.

Let me jot down the formulas I need.

First, calculate the means:
mean X = sum X / n
mean Y = sum Y / n

Then, the slope b of the regression line is given by:
b = [n*sum XY - (sum X)(sum Y)] / [n*sum X^2 - (sum X)^2]

And the intercept a is:
a = mean Y - b * mean X

For the correlation coefficient r, the formula is:
r = [n*sum XY - (sum X)(sum Y)] / sqrt{ [n*sum X^2 - (sum X)^2] [n*sum Y^2 - (sum Y)^2] }

Wait, no, I think the formula for r is covariance of X and Y divided by the product of their standard deviations. Oh right, and covariance is [sum (X - mean X)(Y - mean Y)] / (n-1), but I think the formula I wrote above is using a different approach, perhaps in terms of the sums we have.

Alternatively, another formula for r is:

r = [sum XY - (sum X)(sum Y)/n] / sqrt( [sum X^2 - (sum X)^2/n][sum Y^2 - (sum Y)^2/n] )

Wait, maybe I should use the first approach since I have all the sums. Let me proceed.

So, let's compute the necessary components step by step.

First, calculate the means.

sum X = 1860, n=31. So mean X = 1860 /31. Let me compute that. 31*60 is 1860, so 1860/31=60. So mean X is 60.

sum Y =465, mean Y=465/31. Let me compute that. 31*15=465, so 465/31=15. So mean Y is 15.

Wait, that's interesting. So on average, X is 60, Y is 15.

Next, I need to calculate the numerator and denominator for b.

Numerator for b: n*sum XY - sum X * sum Y.

n=31, sum XY=23,400.

So numerator = 31*23400 - 1860*465.

Let me compute each part.

31 *23400: Let's see, 30*23400=702,000. 1*23400=23,400. So total is 702,000+23,400=725,400.

sum X * sum Y = 1860 *465. Let me calculate that.

Calculate 1860 * 400 = 744,000.

1860 * 65: 1860*60=111,600 and 1860*5=9,300. So 111,600+9,300=120,900.

So total 744,000 + 120,900 = 864,900.

So numerator is 725,400 - 864,900 = -139,500.

Denominator for b: n*sum X^2 - (sum X)^2.

n=31, sum X^2=201,600.

So 31*201,600 = Let's compute that. 30*201,600=6,048,000. 1*201,600=201,600. So total 6,048,000 +201,600=6,249,600.

(sum X)^2 is (1860)^2. 186 squared is 34,596, so 1860^2 is 34,596*100=3,459,600.

So denominator is 6,249,600 -3,459,600 = 2,790,000.

So b = numerator / denominator = (-139,500) / 2,790,000.

Let me compute that. Divide numerator and denominator by 100: -1395 / 27900.

Divide numerator and denominator by 15: -93 / 1860. Hmm, maybe a better approach is to compute it as a decimal.

-139500 ÷ 2,790,000. Let me see: 2,790,000 × 0.05 = 139,500. So 0.05 is 5/100. So 139500 is 0.05 times 2,790,000. But since the numerator is negative, b is -0.05.

Wait, 0.05 * 2,790,000 = 139,500, so -139,500 is -0.05 times 2,790,000. So yes, b= -0.05.

So the slope is -0.05. Now, the intercept a is mean Y - b * mean X.

mean Y is 15, mean X is 60.

So a = 15 - (-0.05)*60.

Wait, no: a = mean Y - b * mean X.

So 15 - (-0.05)*60. Let me compute that. (-0.05)*60 = -3. So 15 - (-3) = 15 +3 =18.

So the regression equation is Y = 18 -0.05 X.

Now, next step is to compute the correlation coefficient r.

The formula for r is:

r = [n sum XY - sum X sum Y] / sqrt{ [n sum X^2 - (sum X)^2][n sum Y^2 - (sum Y)^2] }

We already have some of these values. Let's compute each part.

Numerator: n sum XY - sum X sum Y = 725,400 -864,900 = -139,500. Same as before.

Denominator: sqrt( [n sum X^2 - (sum X)^2][n sum Y^2 - (sum Y)^2] )

We have n sum X^2 - (sum X)^2 = 2,790,000 (from earlier).

n sum Y^2: n=31, sum Y^2=7,925. So 31*7,925 = Let's compute:

30 *7,925 = 237,750.

1 *7,925 =7,925.

Total: 237,750 +7,925=245,675.

(sum Y)^2 = (465)^2. Let me compute that. 400^2=160,000, 65^2=4,225. 2*(400)(65)=52,000. So (400+65)^2=160,000 +52,000 +4,225=216,225.

So n sum Y^2 - (sum Y)^2 =245,675 -216,225=29,450.

So the denominator becomes sqrt(2,790,000 *29,450).

Wait, but let's compute that.

First, compute 2,790,000 *29,450.

Hmm, that's a big number, but maybe I can factor it or compute it step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps I can take the square roots of each part separately and then multiply them.

Wait, because sqrt(a*b)=sqrt(a)*sqrt(b).

So sqrt(2,790,000) * sqrt(29,450).

Compute sqrt(2,790,000):

2,790,000 = 2,790 * 1,000.

sqrt(2,790,000) = sqrt(2,790) * sqrt(1000).

sqrt(1000)=31.6227766 approximately.

Now, sqrt(2,790). Let's see: 50^2=2500, 53^2=2809, which is close to 2790. 53^2=2809, so 2,790 is 19 less than 2809. So sqrt(2790)= approx 52.8 (since 52.8^2= approx 52^2=2704, 0.8^2=0.64, 2*52*0.8=83.2, so (52+0.8)^2=2704 +83.2 +0.64=2787.84, which is very close to 2790. So sqrt(2790)≈52.8.

So sqrt(2,790,000)=52.8 *31.6227766≈52.8 *31.62 ≈ let me compute 50*31.62=1,581, plus 2.8*31.62≈88.536, so total≈1,581 +88.536=1,669.536.

Now compute sqrt(29,450). Let's see, 170^2=28,900, 171^2=29,241, 172^2=29,584. So 29,450 is between 171 and 172.

Compute 171^2=29,241. 29,450-29,241=209. So 171 + 209/(2*171 +1) approximation.

Approximation: sqrt(29,450)=171 + 209/(342 +1)=171 + 209/343≈171 +0.61=171.61.

So sqrt(29,450)≈171.61.

So the denominator is approx 1,669.536 *171.61.

Wait, that's a huge number. Let me compute this:

1,669.536 * 171.61.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe I should compute the exact value using another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the exact values for each part.

Wait, another approach: since the numerator is -139,500, and the denominator is the square root of (2,790,000 *29,450), which is sqrt(2,790,000)*sqrt(29,450)= approx 1,669.536 * 171.61≈ let me compute 1,669.536 *171.61.

Wait, maybe I can compute it as:

1,669.536 *170 = 1,669.536 *100=166,953.6; 1,669.536*70=116,867.52; so total 166,953.6 +116,867.52=283,821.12.

Then 1,669.536 *1.61≈ approximately 1,669.536 *1.6=2,669.2576 and 1,669.536 *0.01=16.69536. So total≈2,669.2576 +16.69536≈2,685.95296.

So total denominator≈283,821.12 +2,685.95296≈286,507.07296.

So denominator≈286,507.07.

Numerator is -139,500.

So r= -139,500 /286,507.07 ≈ let's compute this division.

Compute 139500 ÷ 286507.07.

Let me approximate. 286,507 is roughly 287,000.

139,500 ÷287,000 ≈ 0.486.

So r≈-0.486.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

Compute 139500 divided by 286507.07.

Let me see: 286507.07 × 0.486 = ?

0.4 *286507.07=114,602.828

0.08 *286507.07=22,920.5656

0.006*286507.07≈1,719.042

Sum: 114,602.828 +22,920.5656=137,523.3936 +1,719.042≈139,242.4356.

So 0.486 *286,507.07≈139,242.44, which is close to 139,500. The difference is 139,500 -139,242.44=257.56.

So 257.56 /286,507.07≈ approx 0.0009.

So total r≈-0.486 + (approx 0.0009) → -0.4869.

So approximately -0.487. Rounded to four decimal places, maybe -0.4867 or so.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact values without approximations.

Let me recompute the denominator.

n sum X^2 =31 *201600=6,249,600.

sum X squared is 1860²=3,459,600.

So n sum X^2 - (sum X)^2 =6,249,600 -3,459,600=2,790,000.

n sum Y^2=31*7925=245,675.

sum Y squared is 465²=216,225.

So n sum Y^2 - (sum Y)^2=245,675-216,225=29,450.

So the denominator is sqrt(2,790,000 *29,450).

Let me compute 2,790,000 *29,450.

2,790,000 *29,450 = ?

Well, 2,790,000 *29,450 = 2,790,000 * (30,000 -550) = 2,790,000*30,000 -2,790,000*550.

Compute each term:

2,790,000 *30,000 =83,700,000,000.

2,790,000 *550 = (2,790,000 *500) + (2,790,000 *50).

2,790,000 *500=1,395,000,000.

2,790,000 *50=139,500,000.

So 1,395,000,000 +139,500,000=1,534,500,000.

So 83,700,000,000 -1,534,500,000=82,165,500,000.

So 2,790,000 *29,450=82,165,500,000.

So sqrt(82,165,500,000).

Wait, that's a huge number. Let me compute sqrt(8.21655e10).

Wait, 82,165,500,000 =8.21655e10.

The square root of 8.21655e10 is sqrt(8.21655)*1e5, since (1e5)^2=1e10.

sqrt(8.21655)≈2.8665 (since 2.866^2≈8.216). So sqrt(8.21655e10)=2.8665e5=286,650.

So denominator is 286,650.

Numerator is -139,500.

So r= -139,500 /286,650 ≈-0.4867.

Yes, that's consistent with my earlier approximation.

So r≈-0.4867.

Now, looking at the options, let's see which one matches Y= a +bX with a=18, b=-0.05, and r≈-0.4867.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Y=18 -0.05 X, r=-0.4867. That's exactly what I got.

Option C: Y=20 -0.05 X, same r. So a would be 20 in that case, but my a is 18.

Option G: Y=18-0.06 X, r=-0.4867. So different b.

So the correct option is A: Y=18 -0.05X, r=-0.4867.

To solve the problem, we need to compute the regression line and the correlation coefficient \( r \) for the given data. The regression line is of the form \( Y = a + bX \), where \( b \) is the slope and \( a \) is the y-intercept. The correlation coefficient \( r \) measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between \( X \) and \( Y \).

### Step 1: Calculate the means of \( X \) and \( Y \)
The means are calculated as:
\[
\bar{X} = \frac{\sum X}{n} = \frac{1860}{31} = 60
\]
\[
\bar{Y} = \frac{\sum Y}{n} = \frac{465}{31} = 15
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the slope \( b \) of the regression line
The formula for the slope is:
\[
b = \frac{n \sum XY - (\sum X)(\sum Y)}{n \sum X^2 - (\sum X)^2}
\]
Substituting the given values:
\[
b = \frac{31 \cdot 23,400 - 1860 \cdot 465}{31 \cdot 201,600 - 1860^2}
\]
First, compute the numerator:
\[
31 \cdot 23,400 = 725,400, \quad 1860 \cdot 465 = 864,900
\]
\[
\text{Numerator} = 725,400 - 864,900 = -139,500
\]
Next, compute the denominator:
\[
31 \cdot 201,600 = 6,249,600, \quad 1860^2 = 3,459,600
\]
\[
\text{Denominator} = 6,249,600 - 3,459,600 = 2,790,000
\]
Thus:
\[
b = \frac{-139,500}{2,790,000} = -0.05
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the y-intercept \( a \)
The formula for the y-intercept is:
\[
a = \bar{Y} - b \bar{X}
\]
