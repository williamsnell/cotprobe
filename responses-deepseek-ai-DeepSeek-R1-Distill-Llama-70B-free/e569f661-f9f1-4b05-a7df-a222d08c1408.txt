Okay, so I have this question about E. coli strains, specifically the Hfr strain. Hmm, I remember that E. coli has different strains, and some are related to their ability to transfer genetic material.

Wait, the question is asking what an Hfr strain contains. I think Hfr stands for High frequency of recombination. Right, because these cells can transfer a lot of their DNA to other bacteria, leading to more genetic recombination.

I remember that F factor is involved here. Oh right, the F factor is a plasmid that allows conjugation. But wait, in Hfr cells, the F plasmid is integrated into the bacterial chromosome. So instead of being a separate plasmid, it's part of the main chromosome.

So the F factor in Hfr cells is inserted into the chromosome. So the Hfr strain's chromosome has the F factor integrated. That means the bacterial chromosome has this extra genetic material from the F factor.

Looking at the options now. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: a bacterial chromosome with an E. coli gene inserted. No, that doesn't make sense. The F factor is not an E. coli gene; it's a plasmid that got integrated.

Option B: a vector used for making copies. No, that's more like a plasmid vector, not the Hfr strain's feature.

Option C: human chromosome with bacterial gene. No, the question is about E. coli, so human chromosomes aren't involved.

Option D: human chromosome with F factor. Again, no, it's about E. coli's own chromosome.

Option E: bacterial chromosome without any gene. No, because Hfr has the F factor inserted.

Option F: bacterial chromosome with F factor inserted. That sounds right. Because the F is integrated into the chromosome in Hfr cells.

Option G: bacterial with human gene. No, unless it's about transformation with foreign DNA, which isn't what Hfr is about.

Option H: yeast chromosome. Not relevant here.

Option I: human with transposable element. No.

Option J: bacterial with transposable. Not exactly; the F factor is a plasmid, not a transposable element, I think. Or wait, are F plasmids considered as such? I might be mixing things up. But no, the F factor is a sex plasmid, and when integrated, it's part of the chromosome.

So the correct answer should be F: bacterial chromosome with the F factor inserted.

The Hfr strain of *E. coli* is characterized by its ability to transfer a large portion of its chromosome during conjugation due to the integration of the F factor (a plasmid) into its bacterial chromosome. This integration allows for high-frequency recombination. Among the options provided, the correct description is that the Hfr strain contains a bacterial chromosome with the F factor inserted.

**Answer: F**
