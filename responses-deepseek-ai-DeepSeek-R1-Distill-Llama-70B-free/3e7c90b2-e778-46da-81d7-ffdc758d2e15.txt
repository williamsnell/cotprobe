Okay, so I've got this biology question here about how algae and fungi differ in how they obtain their food. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that algae are simple eukaryotic organisms, right? And they're usually green because they contain chlorophyll. Oh wait, right, they photosynthesize! So they make their own food from sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water. That makes them autotrophs. Autotrophs produce their own food, so they don't need to eat other organisms or take in nutrients from their surroundings.

Now, what about fungi? Fungi are a bit different. I think they don't photosynthesize because they don't have chlorophyll. So they must get their food another way. I remember that fungi are decomposers. They secrete enzymes onto their food source, breaking it down externally, and then absorb the nutrients. Oh, right, that's called absorption. So fungi are heterotrophs because they can't make their own food and need to obtain nutrients from other sources.

So putting it together: algae make their own food through photosynthesis (autotrophs), and fungi obtain their food by absorbing nutrients from their environment (heterotrophs). 

Looking at the options now. Option G says "Algae are autotrophs and fungi are heterotrophs." That matches what I was thinking. Let me quickly glance through the other options to make sure I'm not missing something.

Option A: Algae using phagocytosis? No, that's more like how some protists get food. Fungi using mycorrhizal associationsâ€”well, that's a type of symbiosis, but it's still about absorbing nutrients, not making their own food.

Option B: Both being heterotrophs. No, algae are autotrophs.

Option C: Algae via chemosynthesis? No, that's different. Chemosynthesis is using chemicals, not sunlight. Some bacteria do that, not algae.

Option D: Both obtain food by ingestion. No, algae don't ingest; they photosynthesize.

Option E: Algae absorb, fungi photosynthesize? That's the opposite. So wrong.

Option F: Both autotrophs. No, fungi can't photosynthesize.

Option H: Fungi as parasites, algae as saprophytes. Some fungi are parasites, others decompose. Algae are autotrophs, not saprophytes.

Option I: Algae decomposers, fungi photosynthetic. No, that's reversed.

Option J: Algae heterotrophs, fungi autotrophs. Also wrong.

So yes, Option G is correct.

The algae and fungi differ in their methods of obtaining food because algae are autotrophs, meaning they produce their own food through photosynthesis using sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water. In contrast, fungi are heterotrophs, obtaining their nutrients by absorbing decomposed organic matter or forming symbiotic relationships with other organisms. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A, C, D, E, F, H, I, J**: These options either misrepresent the methods of nutrient acquisition for algae or fungi or reverse their roles.
- **B**: Incorrect because algae are not heterotrophs.
- **G**: Correctly states that algae are autotrophs and fungi are heterotrophs.

Thus, the correct answer is:

G
