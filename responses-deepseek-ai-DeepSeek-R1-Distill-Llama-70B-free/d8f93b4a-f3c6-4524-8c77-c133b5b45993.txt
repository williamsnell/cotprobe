Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about deception in experiments. Hmm, I remember that ethics in research is a big deal, especially when it comes to human subjects. I think I need to recall the guidelines for when deception is permissible.

Alright, the question is asking what's essential for deception to be permissible. The options are A through F. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Participants have given informed consent to be deceived. Wait, but if they're being deceived, they can't really give informed consent about the true nature of the study. So maybe this isn't right. I think informed consent usually requires that participants know what's going on, so if they're being deceived, they might not have full informed consent. Or maybe in some cases, they consent to being deceived in general? Not sure.

Option B: Deception doesn't involve withholding info about the purpose. That doesn't sound right. Deception often involves not telling the full truth, so maybe this is the opposite of what's permissible. If you don't withhold info, then you're not deceiving. So B might not be correct.

Option C: Investigator explains the deception within 3 years after. I remember something about debriefing after the study. But 3 years seems too long. Usually, it's done right after the experiment ends. So maybe C isn't the right choice because the timeframe is way off.

Option D: The scientific merit justifies the deception. I think this is a key point. For deception to be allowed, the study's benefits must outweigh the risks, and the deception must be necessary. So if the research has significant value and couldn't be done without deception, it's more likely to be permissible. So D sounds like a strong candidate.

Option E: Deception involves providing false info about the purpose. That does happen in some studies. But is that the essential condition for it being permissible? Or is it just a method of deception? The question is about what makes it permissible, not just what deception entails. So E might not be the answer.

Option F: Deception is revealed only if they ask. No, I think ethical guidelines require that participants be debriefed after, regardless of whether they ask. So F doesn't sound right.

Putting it together: The essential factor is that the benefits of the research (merits) justify the deception. So the correct answer should be D.

The essential factor for deception in an experiment to be permissible is that the scientific investigation's merits or value must justify the type of deception used. This ensures that the benefits of the research outweigh the risks associated with deceiving participants. 

Answer: D
