Okay, so I have this question about bond pricing, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is: What is the price of a three-year bond with a face value of $100, paying 5% coupons, and a yield of 6%? The options are A through J with various prices.

Alright, I remember that bonds are priced based on the present value of their future cash flows. So I need to calculate the present value of the coupons and the face value.

First, let me get the details clear. The bond has a face value (also called par value) of $100. It's a three-year bond, so it will mature in three years. It pays a 5% coupon, which means each year it pays 5% of the face value. So the annual coupon payment is $5 because 5% of 100 is 5. 

The yield to maturity is 6%, which is the discount rate we'll use to calculate the present value. The yield is higher than the coupon rate, which I think means the bond is selling at a discount because the market rate is higher than the bond's rate. So the price should be less than $100.

Wait, but let me not get ahead of myself. I should calculate it properly.

So the bond pays $5 each year for three years, and then at maturity, it pays the face value of $100. So the cash flows are:

Year 1: $5

Year 2: $5

Year 3: $5 + $100 = $105

To find the present value (PV) of these cash flows, I need to discount each of them back to the present using the yield (6% or 0.06 as a decimal).

The formula for present value is PV = (Cash Flow) / (1 + r)^n, where r is the discount rate and n is the number of periods.

So for each year:

PV of Year 1 coupon: 5 / (1.06)^1

PV of Year 2 coupon: 5 / (1.06)^2

PV of Year 3 (coupon + face value): 105 / (1.06)^3

Then sum all these up.

Let me calculate each part.

First, let's compute the denominators.

(1.06)^1 = 1.06

(1.06)^2 = 1.1236

(1.06)^3 = approximately 1.191016

Now compute each PV:

Year 1: 5 / 1.06 ≈ 4.71698

Year 2: 5 / 1.1236 ≈ 4.45033

Year 3: 105 / 1.191016 ≈ let's see, 105 divided by approx 1.191016. Let me compute that.

Hmm, 105 / 1.191016. Let me calculate this. Let's see, 1.191016 times 87 is about 103.6, so 88 times 1.191016 is about 104.69, which is higher than 105. So maybe 88. Wait, maybe I should do it more accurately.

Alternatively, I can compute 105 / 1.191016.

Let me compute 1.191016 * 87.9 = ?

1.191016 * 87 = approx 103.648. Then 0.9 * 1.191016 is about 1.0719. So 103.648 + 1.0719 ≈ 104.72. So 87.9 * 1.191016 ≈ 104.72. But we have 105 as the numerator, so 105 / 1.191016 ≈ approx 88.29.

Wait, but maybe it's better to just compute it directly. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a calculator approach.

But since I don't have a calculator, I'll proceed with approximate values.

So Year 3 PV ≈ 88.29.

Wait, perhaps I can calculate 1.06^3 more accurately. Let me compute 1.06 cubed.

1.06 * 1.06 = 1.1236. Then 1.1236 * 1.06.

Compute 1.1236 * 1.06:

1 * 1.06 = 1.06

0.1236 * 1.06: Let's see, 0.1236 * 1 = 0.1236, 0.1236 * 0.06 = ~0.007416. So total 0.131016.

So 1.1236 * 1.06 = 1.06 + 0.131016 = 1.191016. So that part is correct.

So 105 / 1.191016.

Let me compute this division step by step. Let me think of 105 divided by 1.191016.

Another approach: Let me write it as 105 * (1 / 1.191016). Since 1/1.191016 is approximately 0.84.

Wait, because 1.191016 * 0.84 = ?

Let me check: 1 * 0.84 = 0.84, 0.191016 *0.84 ≈ 0.16045. So total ≈ 0.84 + 0.16045 = 1.00045. So 1/1.191016 is approximately 0.84.

So 105 * 0.84 = 88.2. So the PV for year 3 is approximately 88.2.

Wait, but that seems a bit high. Alternatively, perhaps 0.8397 is a better approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 1.191016 * 88 = ?

1.191016 * 80 = 95.28128

1.191016 * 8 = 9.528128

So 95.28128 + 9.528128 = 104.809408

Which is 104.8094, which is just under 105. So 88 times gives about 104.8094.

So 105 is about 104.8094 + 0.1906. So to get to 105, how much more do we need beyond 88?

Each additional 0.1 in the multiplier adds 1.191016 * 0.1 = 0.1191016.

So the difference is 105 - 104.8094 = 0.1906.

So how many times 0.1191 is 0.1906? Let's see, 0.1906 / 0.1191 ≈ 1.6.

So 0.1 * 1.6 = 0.16.

So the multiplier is 88 + 0.16 = 88.16. So 1.191016 * 88.16 = approx 105.

So 105 / 1.191016 ≈ 88.16.

Wait, but that's the present value for the third year's cash flow.

So now, let me sum up all the present values.

Year 1: ~4.717

Year 2: ~4.450

Year 3: ~88.16

Adding these together: 4.717 + 4.450 = 9.167, plus 88.16 gives approximately 97.327.

Wait, that's around 97.33. Looking at the options, option D is $97.33.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes rounding can cause errors.

Alternatively, perhaps using a more precise method.

Let me compute each present value more accurately.

First, calculate each discount factor:

Year 1: 1/(1.06)^1 = 1/1.06 ≈ 0.943396

So 5 * 0.943396 = 4.71698

Year 2: 1/(1.06)^2 = 1/1.1236 ≈ 0.889965

So 5 * 0.889965 ≈ 4.4498

Year 3: 1/(1.06)^3 ≈ 0.839920 (since 1.06^3=1.191016, 1/1.191016≈0.839920)

So 105 * 0.839920 ≈ 88.1812

Now, sum all three:

4.71698 + 4.4498 = 9.16678

Add 88.1812: 9.16678 + 88.1812 = 97.348

So approximately $97.35. Looking at the options, option D is $97.33, which is very close.

Wait, but let me check the calculation for the third year again. Maybe I miscalculated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the present value of an ordinary annuity formula for the coupons and then add the present value of the face value.

The coupon payments are an annuity of $5 per year for 3 years. The present value of an ordinary annuity (PVA) is given by PVA = PMT * [(1 - (1 + r)^-n) / r]

So PMT is 5, r is 0.06, n=3.

PVA = 5 * [ (1 - (1.06)^-3 ) / 0.06 ]

Calculate (1.06)^-3 = 1 / (1.06)^3 ≈ 1/1.191016 ≈ 0.839920

So 1 - 0.839920 = 0.16008

Divide by 0.06: 0.16008 / 0.06 ≈ 2.668

So PVA ≈ 5 * 2.668 ≈ 13.34

Then, the present value of the face value ($100) is 100 * (1.06)^-3 ≈ 100 * 0.839920 ≈ 83.992

So total bond price is 13.34 + 83.992 ≈ 97.332, which is approximately $97.33, matching option D.

So I think the correct answer is D: $97.33.

To determine the price of a three-year bond with a face value of $100, a 5% coupon rate, and a yield of 6%, we calculate the present value of all future cash flows. The bond pays $5 annually in coupons and returns the $100 face value at maturity. The yield of 6% is used as the discount rate.

The cash flows are as follows:
- **Year 1**: $5 (coupon payment)
- **Year 2**: $5 (coupon payment)
- **Year 3**: $105 ($5 coupon + $100 face value)

The present value (PV) of each cash flow is calculated using the formula:

\[
PV = \frac{\text{Cash Flow}}{(1 + r)^n}
\]

where \( r = 0.06 \) and \( n \) is the number of years.

1. **Year 1**:  
   \[
   PV = \frac{5}{(1.06)^1} = \frac{5}{1.06} \approx 4.717
   \]

2. **Year 2**:  
   \[
   PV = \frac{5}{(1.06)^2} = \frac{5}{1.1236} \approx 4.450
   \]

3. **Year 3**:  
   \[
   PV = \frac{105}{(1.06)^3} = \frac{105}{1.191016} \approx 88.181
   \]

Summing these present values gives the bond price:

\[
\text{Bond Price} = 4.717 + 4.450 + 88.181 \approx 97.348
\]

This calculation shows that the bond price is approximately $97.33. Among the given options, the closest match is **D: $97.33**.
