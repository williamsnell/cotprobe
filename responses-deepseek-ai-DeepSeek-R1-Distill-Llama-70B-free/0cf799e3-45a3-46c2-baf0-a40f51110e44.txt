Okay, so I have this logic problem here, and I'm trying to figure out if a set of propositions is consistent using indirect truth tables. Hmm, I remember that a set of propositions is consistent if there's at least one way to assign truth values to the individual propositions so that all the statements in the set are true. If no such assignment exists, the set is inconsistent.

The problem gives me three propositions:

1. ~N ≡ (O · P)
2. ~O ⊃ Q
3. N · ~Q

And I have to evaluate these using indirect truth tables, which I think means I'll assume the negation of the conjunction of all propositions and see if that leads to a contradiction. Wait, no, maybe for each proposition, I'll check possible truth values.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to try to find a valuation where all three are true. Let's see.

Let me list the propositions again:

1. ~N is equivalent to (O AND P). So ~N ↔ (O ∧ P)
2. ~O implies Q. So if O is false, then Q must be true.
3. N AND ~Q. So both N is true and Q is false.

Hmm, that third proposition says N is true and Q is false. So from proposition 3, N is true and Q is false.

Now, let's see what this implies for the other propositions.

Starting with proposition 3: N is true and Q is false.

Now, looking at proposition 2: ~O → Q. Since Q is false, for ~O → Q to be true, ~O must be false. Because in implication, if the consequent is false, the antecedent must be false for the implication to hold. So if Q is false, ~O must be false, which means O is true.

So from proposition 3, Q is false, which makes O true via proposition 2.

Now, O is true. Let's look at proposition 1: ~N ≡ (O · P). Since N is true (from proposition 3), ~N is false. So the left side is false. Therefore, (O · P) must be false because they are equivalent. So (O AND P) must be false.

But O is true, as we found. So for (O AND P) to be false, P must be false. Because if O is true and the whole conjunction is false, P has to be false.

So putting it all together:

From proposition 3: N is true, Q is false.

From proposition 2: since Q is false, ~O must be false, so O is true.

From proposition 1: ~N is false, so (O · P) must be false. Since O is true, P must be false.

So the valuation is:

N: True

O: True

P: False

Q: False

Now, let's check each proposition with these values.

1. ~N ≡ (O · P)

~N is False (since N is True). O·P is (True AND False) which is False. So False ≡ False, which holds.

2. ~O → Q

~O is False (since O is True), and Q is False. In implication, False → anything is True, so this holds.

3. N · ~Q is True (N is True) AND (Q is False → ~Q is True). So True AND True is True. This holds.

So all three propositions are true under this valuation. Therefore, the set is consistent.

Wait, but let me check the options given. The options are from A to J, each giving whether the set is consistent or inconsistent and providing a valuation.

Option C says: Consistent. Consistent valuation when N, O, and P are true and Q is false.

Wait, in my valuation, P is False, not True. So option C's valuation is N, O, P all true, Q false. Let me see if that works.

If N is true, O is true, P is true, Q is false.

Check proposition 1: ~N is False. O·P is True. So False ≡ True? That's False, so proposition 1 would be false under that valuation. So that can't be a consistent valuation because proposition 1 would not hold. So option C's valuation isn't valid, but my earlier valuation is N true, O true, P false, Q false.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option E: Consistent. Consistent valuation when N and P are true and O and Q are false.

Wait, that's N=T, P=T, O=F, Q=F. Let me check that.

Proposition 1: ~N = F. O·P = F AND T = F. So F ≡ F, which holds.

Proposition 2: ~O = T. So ~O → Q becomes T → F, which is F. So proposition 2 would be false in this case. Therefore, option E's valuation isn't valid either.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the options.

Wait, let me look again:

Option C: N, O, P true, Q false.

Option E: N and P true, O and Q false.

Wait, so in option E, O is false. Let me see:

If O is false, then from proposition 2, ~O is true, so Q must be true. But in option E, Q is false, so that would make proposition 2 false. So option E's valuation can't satisfy all three propositions.

Wait, maybe I need to re-examine the options.

Looking back, the correct valuation I found is N=true, O=true, P=false, Q=false.

Which option matches this? Let me see:

Looking at the options:

Option C: N, O, P are true, Q false. No, because P is false in my case.

Option E: N and P are true, O and Q false. No, because O is true in my case.

Option G: N and O true, P and Q false. Yes, that's exactly my valuation.

Option G says: Consistent. Consistent valuation when N and O are true and P and Q are false.

So that's correct because all propositions hold under that valuation.

Wait, but looking at the options, option G is one of the choices.

So the correct answer would be that the set is consistent, and option G provides a valid valuation.

Wait, but let me double-check the options given.

The options are:

A: Inconsistent. Valuation all false.

B: Inconsistent.

C: Consistent. N, O, P true; Q false.

D: Inconsistent. N and P true, O and Q false.

E: Consistent. N and P true, O and Q false.

F: Inconsistent. All true.

G: Consistent. N and O true, P and Q false.

H: Consistent. O, P, Q true; N false.

So the correct answer should be option G, as it matches the valuation where N=true, O=true, P=false, Q=false, which satisfies all three propositions.

Therefore, the set is consistent, option G.

To determine whether the set of propositions is consistent, we analyze the three propositions:

1. **~N ≡ (O · P)**  
2. **~O ⊃ Q**  
3. **N · ~Q**

### Step 1: Analyze Proposition 3  
From **N · ~Q**, we conclude:  
- **N is true** (since N is part of the conjunction).  
- **Q is false** (since ~Q is part of the conjunction).  

### Step 2: Use Q = false in Proposition 2  
From **~O ⊃ Q**, and since Q is false:  
- For the implication to hold, **~O must be false**, which means **O is true**.  

### Step 3: Use N = true and O = true in Proposition 1  
From **~N ≡ (O · P)**:  
- Since N is true, **~N is false**.  
- For the equivalence to hold, **(O · P) must also be false**.  
- Given that O is true, **P must be false** (since true · false = false).  

### Step 4: Assign Truth Values  
The consistent valuation is:  
- **N = true**  
- **O = true**  
- **P = false**  
- **Q = false**

### Step 5: Verify Each Proposition  
1. **~N ≡ (O · P)**:  
   - ~N = false, O · P = (true · false) = false.  
   - False ≡ false, so this holds.  

2. **~O ⊃ Q**:  
   - ~O = false, Q = false.  
   - False → false is true, so this holds.  

3. **N · ~Q**:  
   - N = true, ~Q = true.  
   - True · true = true, so this holds.  

### Step 6: Evaluate the Options  
- **Option G** states: "Consistent. Consistent valuation when N and O are true and P and Q are false."  
This matches the valuation derived above, where all three propositions are satisfied.  

### Conclusion  
The set of propositions is consistent, and the correct answer is **Option G**.
