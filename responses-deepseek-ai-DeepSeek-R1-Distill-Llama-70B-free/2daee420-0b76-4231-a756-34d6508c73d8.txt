Okay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics problem about color blindness. Let's see what the question says. So, color blindness is caused by a sex-linked recessive gene, denoted as 'd'. There's a sample of 2000 peopleâ€”1000 males and 1000 females. Among the males, 90 are color-blind. I need to find out what percentage of the women are phenotypically normal.

Hmm, right. I remember that color blindness is typically an X-linked recessive trait. So males have one X and one Y chromosome. Females have two X chromosomes. Since males only need one copy of the recessive allele to show the trait, the presence of 'd' on their single X means they're color-blind. But females need two copies (one on each X) to express the condition.

The problem states that 90 males are color-blind. Wait, but there are 1000 males in total. So the number of color-blind males is 90 out of 1000. Since males only have one X, each male's X must carry the 'd' allele. So, the frequency of the 'd' allele in the population, in terms of the X chromosomes, can be calculated from the males.

Wait, but how does this translate to the females? Because females have two X chromosomes, the chance that a woman has two 'd' alleles would be the square of the frequency of 'd' in the population. But wait, I might be mixing up the Hardy-Weinberg principle here. Let me think again.

In a population, the frequency of X-linked recessive alleles can be estimated from the incidence in males. Because males have only one X, the proportion of males with the condition equals the frequency of the 'd' allele in the X chromosomes in the population. So if 90 out of 1000 males are color-blind, that's 9% of males. So the frequency of the 'd' allele is 0.09.

But wait, wait. Because each female has two X chromosomes, the chance that a female has two 'd' alleles is (0.09)^2, since she has to inherit a 'd' from both parents. So the probability a woman is color-blind is (0.09)^2 = 0.0081, which is 0.81%. Therefore, the percentage of women who are color-blind is 0.81%. 

But the question asks for the percentage of women who are phenotypically normal. So the normal women would be 100% minus those who are color-blind. So 100 - 0.81 = 99.19%, approximately 99.2%. Looking at the options, option B is 99 percent, which is the closest. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. So the frequency of the 'd' allele in the population is 0.09 based on the males. For women, the chance they have both X chromosomes with 'd' is (0.09)^2. So 0.0081 is the chance they are color-blind, so 99.19% are normal. So the percentage of women who are normal is approximately 99%, which is option B.

To determine the percentage of women who are phenotypically normal, we start by analyzing the given data. Color blindness is caused by a sex-linked recessive gene ('d'), and the sample consists of 2,000 individuals (1,000 males and 1,000 females). Among the males, 90 are color-blind. Since males have only one X chromosome, the frequency of the 'd' allele in the population can be directly estimated from the proportion of color-blind males. 

The frequency of the 'd' allele is calculated as:

\[
\text{Frequency of 'd'} = \frac{\text{Number of color-blind males}}{\text{Total number of males}} = \frac{90}{1000} = 0.09
\]

For females, who have two X chromosomes, the probability of being color-blind is the square of the allele frequency, as they must inherit two copies of the 'd' allele (one from each parent):

\[
\text{Probability of color-blindness in females} = (0.09)^2 = 0.0081 \, \text{or} \, 0.81\%
\]

The percentage of women who are phenotypically normal is therefore:

\[
100\% - 0.81\% = 99.19\%
\]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, approximately 99% of the women are phenotypically normal. Among the provided options, the closest match is:

**B: 99 percent**
