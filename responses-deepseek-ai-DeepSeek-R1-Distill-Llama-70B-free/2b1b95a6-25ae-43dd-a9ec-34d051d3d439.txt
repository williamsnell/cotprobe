Question:

What contributions did Darwin make to the theoryof evolution?

Options:

A: Darwin presented evidence to prove that organic evolution occurred and devised the theory of natural selection.
B: Darwin proposed that evolution occurs at a constant rate, known as the "steady-state" theory of evolution
C: Darwin developed the "use and disuse" theory, which states that parts of the body that are used extensively become stronger and larger, while those that are not used deteriorate
D: Darwin introduced the idea that acquired characteristics can be inherited, a principle known as Lamarckism
E: Darwin believed that all species remain unchanged over time
F: Darwin disproved the theory of evolution
G: Darwin suggested that the environment has no role in shaping the characteristics of species
H: Darwin formulated the laws of inheritance, which explain how traits are passed down from parents to offspring
I: Darwin hypothesized that all living organisms originated from a single common ancestor in a process he called "anagenesis"
J: Darwin created the concept of special creation

Okay, so I have this question about Darwin's contributions to the theory of evolution, and I need to pick the correct answer from options A to J. Let me think this through step by step.

First, I remember that Charles Darwin is famous for his work on evolution. The main thing I associate with him is natural selection. I think he proposed that species evolve over time through this process where traits that are beneficial for survival get passed on more frequently.

Looking at the options:

Option A says Darwin presented evidence for organic evolution and devised natural selection. That sounds right because I remember he wrote "On the Origin of Species" which had a lot of evidence and introduced natural selection.

Option B mentions a "steady-state" theory and constant rate of evolution. I don't think that's Darwin. Steady-state might relate more to cosmology, like the steady-state theory of the universe, not biology. Plus, evolution rates probably aren't constant, they can vary.

Option C talks about "use and disuse" theory. That rings a bell as Lamarckism, where organisms use or don't use body parts and pass those changes on. But wasn't that Jean-Baptiste Lamarck's idea, not Darwin's? So I don't think C is correct.

Option D is about acquired characteristics being inherited, which is Lamarckism again. So D is likely incorrect because Darwin didn't propose that. I think Darwin's ideas were more about natural selection, not Lamarck's inheritance of acquired traits.

Option E says species remain unchanged, which is the opposite of evolution. So E is wrong because Darwin definitely argued against that, promoting evolution instead.

Option F claims Darwin disproved evolution, which is not true. He actually provided evidence supporting it, so F is incorrect.

Option G suggests the environment has no role, which contradicts natural selection where environment is key. So G is wrong.

Option H is about laws of inheritance. I think that was Mendel with his genetics laws, not Darwin. Darwin's work was before Mendel's, I believe, so H isn't correct.

Option I says all life from a single ancestor via anagenesis. Anagenesis refers to gradual evolution without branching, but I'm not sure if Darwin coined that term. I know he did believe in common descent, but I'm not certain about the term here.

Option J is special creation, which is the idea that each species was created individually, not through evolution. That's the opposite of what Darwin proposed, so J is wrong.

So narrowing it down, the best options are A and I. I think A is correct because it directly mentions natural selection, which I'm certain Darwin proposed. I is about common ancestry, but I'm unsure if Darwin used the term anagenesis. Alternatively, maybe he just called it descent with modification.

Wait, the question is about contributions. So A is correct because it's about presenting evidence and natural selection. That's exactly what Darwin did. The other options don't fit his theories.

The correct answer is A: Darwin presented evidence to prove that organic evolution occurred and devised the theory of natural selection.

Answer: A
