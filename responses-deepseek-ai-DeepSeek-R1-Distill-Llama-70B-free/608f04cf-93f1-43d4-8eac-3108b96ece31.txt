Question:

Define pleasure. Trace its development from infancy to adolescence. What accounts for humor? What situations produce smiling and laughter in adults?

Options:

A: Pleasure is only experienced in childhood, ceasing during adolescence, and adults smile and laugh purely as a social obligation without any connection to humor.
B: Laughter in adults is a sign of discomfort
C: Pleasure is an unchanging emotional state from infancy to adulthood, with no development or variation in expression.
D: Smiling in adults indicates fear
E: Pleasure is a type of pain
F: Pleasure is defined as a constant physical sensation, and humor is unrelated to smiling and laughter, which are reflex actions in adults.
G: Pleasure is a transient state of anxiety relief, and adults smile or laugh only when they are confused.
H: Pleasure can be defined as a reaction to the satisfaction of a motive or the achievement of a goal. Smiling and laughter in adults mainly occur as a result of humor, usually in the form of jokes, riddles, funny stories, etc.
I: Pleasure evolves from a physical to a purely intellectual concept during human development, and adults smile and laugh in response to a sense of superiority.
J: Pleasure is the anticipation of reward without any emotional satisfaction, and adults smile and laugh exclusively in social compliance.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about pleasure, its development, and humor. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's break it down.

First, the question asks to define pleasure and trace its development from infancy to adolescence. Then, it wants to know what accounts for humor and what situations produce smiling and laughter in adults.

Looking at the options, I need to find the one that best fits these criteria. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Pleasure is only in childhood, stops in adolescence, and adults smile as a social obligation without humor. That doesn't sound right. Adults do experience pleasure, so A is probably wrong.

Option B: Laughter in adults is discomfort. No, that's not accurate. Sometimes people laugh when they're nervous, but it's not the main reason.

Option C: Pleasure is unchanged from infancy to adulthood. I don't think so. Infants experience pleasure more physically, like when they're fed or comfortable. As they grow, their sources of pleasure change, like play, then more social or intellectual things. So C is incorrect.

Option D: Smiling indicates fear. No, that's not right. Smiling is usually a sign of happiness or amusement, not fear.

Option E: Pleasure is a type of pain. That's confusing. Pleasure and pain are opposites, so E is wrong.

Option F: Pleasure is a constant physical sensation, humor unrelated to smiling. I don't think so. Humor often makes people smile or laugh, so F is incorrect.

Option G: Pleasure is anxiety relief, adults smile when confused. Not sure. Relief can be a type of pleasure, but smiling usually isn't from confusion. Maybe sometimes, but not mainly.

Option H: Pleasure is a reaction to satisfying a motive or achieving a goal. Adults smile/laugh due to humor like jokes, etc. This sounds plausible. Infants might find pleasure in getting what they need, like food, and as they grow, it becomes more complex, like achieving milestones. Adults use humor, which aligns with this.

Option I: Pleasure evolves from physical to intellectual, adults laugh from superiority. Maybe in some cases, like when someone feels superior, but not the main reason. I think humor is more about finding something funny, not necessarily feeling better than others.

Option J: Pleasure is anticipation without satisfaction, adults comply socially. That doesn't fit. Pleasure involves actual satisfaction, not just anticipation.

So, putting it together, H seems correct. It defines pleasure as a reaction to satisfying motives or goals, which makes sense from infancy (basic needs) to adolescence (more complex achievements). And humor in adults leading to smiles and laughter fits as a common reason.

The correct answer is:

H: Pleasure can be defined as a reaction to the satisfaction of a motive or the achievement of a goal. Smiling and laughter in adults mainly occur as a result of humor, usually in the form of jokes, riddles, funny stories, etc.
