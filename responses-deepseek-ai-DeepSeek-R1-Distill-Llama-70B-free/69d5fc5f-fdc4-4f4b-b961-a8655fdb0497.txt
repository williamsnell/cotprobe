Question:

A company created a new brand of pies. However, a study by the federal Food and Drug Administration revealed that the pies contain potentially harmful levels of nuts for some consumers with nut allergies. As a result, Congress enacted legislation prohibiting the shipment and sale of the pies across state lines. A state has a statute that regulates the shipment and sale of the pies within its territory. In light of the federal legislation prohibiting the shipment and sale of the pies across state lines, the state statute is probably

Options:

A: constitutional, because it is within the state's police power.
B: unconstitutional, because the federal law takes precedence in matters of public safety.
C: constitutional, because the state has a compelling interest in protecting its citizens.
D: unconstitutional, because it infringes on the rights of the pie company.
E: constitutional, because Congress did not expressly preempt state legislation.
F: constitutional, because the state has the right to regulate all commerce within its borders.
G: constitutional, because Congress may not regulate an economic activity where both buyer and seller reside in the same state.
H: unconstitutional, because it affects interstate commerce.
I: unconstitutional, because the state cannot contradict federal regulations.

Okay, so I have this question about the constitutionality of a state statute regarding the shipment and sale of pies. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the situation: A company made pies that the FDA found have harmful levels of nuts. So, Congress passed a law prohibiting the shipment and sale of these pies across state lines. Now, a state has its own statute regulating the same within the state. The question is whether the state statute is constitutional in light of the federal law.

Hmm. I remember that when there's a conflict between federal and state laws, the federal law usually takes precedence because of the Supremacy Clause in the Constitution. But wait, the Supremacy Clause applies when the federal government is acting within its constitutional powers. So, Congress has the authority to regulate interstate commerce under the Commerce Clause.

In this case, the federal law is about prohibiting the shipment across state lines, which is clearly interstate commerce. So the federal law is valid under the Commerce Clause. Now, what about the state's statute? It's regulating the shipment and sale within the state. So it's intrastate commerce.

Wait, but sometimes state laws can affect interstate commerce. If the state law conflicts with the federal law, it might be invalid. But here, the state is regulating within its own borders. So maybe it's okay unless it's conflicting with federal law.

I think there's something about the doctrine of preemption. There's express preemption and implied preemption. Express is when Congress explicitly says they're preempting state laws. Implied is when the federal law's purpose is so broad that it leaves no room for state regulation, or when state laws conflict with federal.

So, the question is, does the federal law preempt the state's law here? The federal law prohibits interstate shipment and sale. The state's law is about intrastate. So, perhaps they don't conflict. Because the state is regulating within its own borders, and the federal law is about across state lines.

Wait, but if the state's law is stricter, could that affect interstate commerce indirectly? Or maybe not, because the state is only dealing with its own territory. I think that states can regulate matters of health and safety under their police powers, as long as it doesn't conflict with federal law.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Constitutional under state's police power. That makes sense because states have the authority to protect public health.

Option B: Unconstitutional because federal law takes precedence. But the Supremacy Clause would only apply if there's a conflict. If the state's law is about intrastate, maybe no conflict.

Option E: Constitutional because Congress didn't expressly preempt. That's a point. If Congress didn't say they're preempting, then the state can regulate.

Option H: Unconstitutional because it affects interstate commerce. Wait, but the state's law is about intrastate. Unless the intrastate regulation has an effect on interstate commerce, but I think in this case, it's about the same product but within the state. So maybe not.

Wait, but if the state's law is more restrictive, could it impose a burden on interstate commerce? For example, if a company has to comply with different state laws, it might affect their ability to ship across states. But in this case, the federal law already prohibits interstate shipment. So the state's law is about their own territory, but the product can't be shipped interstate anyway. So perhaps the state's law is allowed.

So, the state's law doesn't interfere with the federal regulation of interstate commerce. It just adds another layer for intrastate. Therefore, the state statute is constitutional.

Looking back at the options, which one fits that. Option A says it's constitutional under police power. Option E says it's constitutional because no express preemption.

Wait, but in the absence of express preemption, the state can regulate unless the federal law's intent is to occupy the entire field. So if the federal law is about interstate, the state can handle intrastate.

So, I think the correct answer is either A or E.

Option A is about police power. States have inherent police powers to regulate for health, safety, morals, and the general welfare. So regulating harmful substances in food would fall under that. So the state's law is constitutional under their police power.

Alternatively, Option E is about the absence of express preemption. So if Congress didn't say they're preempting, then the state's law stands unless there's a conflict.

But wait, the question says that the federal law prohibits shipment and sale across state lines. The state's law regulates shipment and sale within the state. So they're regulating different aspects. So no conflict. So the state's law is constitutional.

So looking at the options, A and E are both possible. But the fact that the state is using its police power would make it constitutional. So A is correct.

Alternatively, E is correct because there's no express preemption. But I think the more precise answer is A, because it's about the state's inherent authority.

Wait, but another angle: The Commerce Clause. If the state's law doesn't burden interstate commerce, then it's okay. But if it does, then it might be unconstitutional. But in this case, the state's law is about intrastate, so it doesn't affect interstate commerce. Therefore, the state can regulate.

So, the answer is A: constitutional because it's within state's police power.

Wait, but looking again, option E says "constitutional because Congress did not expressly preempt". That's also a valid point. So which is more applicable here.

In the absence of express preemption, state laws are allowed unless they conflict. Since the state is regulating intrastate, and the federal is interstate, there's no conflict. So both A and E could be correct, but the question is which reason is right.

The police power is a traditional state authority, so A seems correct.

Wait, but in cases where federal law is based on Commerce Clause, the state's regulation under police power must not conflict with federal law, especially if it's about the same subject.

But in this case, the state's law is about intrastate, so no conflict. So the state's law is constitutional under police power. So the answer is A.

The question revolves around the constitutionality of a state statute regulating the shipment and sale of pies within its territory, given that Congress has enacted federal legislation prohibiting the same across state lines. The analysis hinges on the relationship between federal and state authority, particularly under the Commerce Clause and the Supremacy Clause, as well as the doctrine of preemption.

1. **Federal Authority and the Commerce Clause**: Congress has the power to regulate interstate commerce under the Commerce Clause. The federal law prohibiting the shipment and sale of pies across state lines is a valid exercise of this authority. However, this does not automatically preempt state laws regulating intrastate commerce unless there is a conflict or express preemption.

2. **State Authority and Police Power**: States have inherent police power to regulate matters of health, safety, and welfare. The state statute in question aims to protect consumers from harmful levels of nuts, which falls squarely within this authority. Since the state's law applies only to intrastate commerce, it does not directly conflict with the federal law, which governs interstate commerce.

3. **Preemption Analysis**: Preemption can be express or implied. Here, there is no indication that Congress expressly preempted state laws. Implied preemption could occur if the federal law's purpose is so comprehensive that it leaves no room for state regulation, but this is not the case here. The federal and state laws regulate different spheres (interstate vs. intrastate), so there is no conflict.

4. **Evaluation of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Correct. The state's law is constitutional because it is within the state's police power to regulate health and safety.
   - **Option B**: Incorrect. The federal law does not take precedence over the state's law because they regulate different aspects of commerce (interstate vs. intrastate).
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. While the state has a compelling interest, this is not the primary reason for the law's constitutionality.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. The state's law does not infringe on the pie company's rights; it regulates a legitimate public health concern.
   - **Option E**: Plausible but less precise. While the absence of express preemption supports the state's law, the more direct reasoning is the state's police power.
   - **Option F**: Incorrect. States cannot regulate all commerce within their borders if it affects interstate commerce, but this law does not do so.
   - **Option G**: Incorrect. Congress can regulate intrastate economic activity if it substantially affects interstate commerce, but this is not relevant here.
   - **Option H**: Incorrect. The state's law does not affect interstate commerce.
   - **Option I**: Incorrect. The state's law does not contradict federal regulations; it complements them by addressing intrastate issues.

The most precise and correct answer is that the state's law is constitutional because it is within the state's police power.

Answer: A
