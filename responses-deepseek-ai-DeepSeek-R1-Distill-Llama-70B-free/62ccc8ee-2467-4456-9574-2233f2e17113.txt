Okay, so I have this question here about the temperature at which paper burns. Hmm, I remember hearing something about this before, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me think.

I think it's a commonly known fact, maybe from school or a movie. Oh wait, there's that book called "Fahrenheit 451" by Ray Bradbury. I believe that number is the temperature at which paper burns. So 451 degrees Fahrenheit. That must be where the title comes from.

But wait, I should make sure I'm not mixing things up. Let me recall. Paper's ignition temperature is lower than, say, metals or something. So looking at the options, I see D is 451 degrees. That fits with what I remember from the book.

Other options: 986 seems too high, that's like almost a thousand degrees, which feels way too hot for paper. 2500 is even higher, that's probably for something like steel or another metal. 1500 is also way higher than what I think paper would burn at. 2125 and 3000 are even more extreme. 550, 700, 1000â€”those are all higher than 451, so I don't think they're right.

So yeah, I'm pretty confident the answer is D: 451 degrees.
