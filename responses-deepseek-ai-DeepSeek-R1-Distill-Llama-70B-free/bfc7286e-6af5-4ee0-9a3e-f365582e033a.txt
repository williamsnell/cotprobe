Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the revival of natural law in the 20th century. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but let me think through it.

First, what is natural law? From what I remember, natural law is a philosophy that suggests there are universal principles of right and wrong, derived from nature rather than from human-made laws. It's been around for a long time, like back to ancient Greek philosophers and then in the medieval period with people like Thomas Aquinas.

But the question is about its revival in the 20th century. So why would natural law ideas become prominent again after, say, the 19th or early 20th century when maybe legal positivism was more in vogue?

Looking at the options:

A: The end of the Cold War. That was in the late 80s/early 90s. I'm not sure how that ties into natural law. Maybe the need for international cooperation or something, but I'm not certain.

B: The Bolshevik Revolution. That was in 1917. That's more about communism rising, which is more linked to Marxist ideas, possibly opposing natural law if it's seen as bourgeois or religious.

C: International recognition of human rights after WWII. Oh, yes, that rings a bell. After the atrocities of WWII, especially the Holocaust, there was a big push for human rights. Documents like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. Natural law often underpins the idea that certain rights are inherent and universal, regardless of local laws. So this could definitely be a factor.

D: The invention of the Internet. That's much later, like late 20th century. I don't see a direct link between the internet and natural law revival.

E: The rise of Fascism. That happened in the mid-20th century, but fascism was more about authoritarianism and might-makes-right, which seems opposite to natural law's emphasis on universal moral principles.

F: The rise of Communism in China. That's post-WWII, 1949. Similar to B, communism might not align with natural law, unless it's a reaction against it. But I'm not sure.

G: Depression of the 1930s. Economic hardship, but how does that tie into natural law? Maybe people looking for moral frameworks during tough times, but not sure if that's a major factor.

H: Advent of the Industrial Revolution. That was in the 18th-19th centuries, so not 20th century.

So, the options that seem most relevant are C and maybe A. But A is about the end of the Cold War, which is later. The question is about the 20th century, so the earlier part might be more relevant.

In the aftermath of WWII, there was a lot of reflection on the horrors that happened. The Nuremberg trials, for example, used the concept of crimes against humanity, which is based on natural law ideas. People started talking more about universal human rights that apply regardless of local laws. That makes sense as a reason for natural law's revival.

So the correct answer is probably option C: The international recognition of human rights after World War II.

The revival of natural law in the 20th century can be traced to significant historical events that underscored the need for universal moral principles. Among the options provided, the international recognition of human rights after World War II stands out as the most plausible factor. The atrocities of WWII, including the Holocaust, led to a global emphasis on human rights, exemplified by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948. Natural law, which posits that certain rights are inherent and universal, aligns with this movement, making it a key contributor to its revival.

Answer: C
