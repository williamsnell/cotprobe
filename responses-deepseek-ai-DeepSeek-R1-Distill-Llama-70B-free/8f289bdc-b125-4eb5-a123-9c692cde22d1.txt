Question:

After graduating from law school, a graduate moved to a city where she had been offered a position in an entertainment law firm. When she arrived, the graduate was told that her job was contingent on passing the state bar examination, which was being offered in July. In preparing for the bar examination, the graduate planned to take a bar review course. Although she had not pre-enrolled, the graduate planned to attend and pay for the course at registration. On the morning the course was set to begin, the graduate arrived late after getting stuck in freeway traffic. By the time the graduate got to the course location, registration had already been completed. When the graduate looked into the room where the course was being conducted, she saw the lecture had begun, and everyone was inside busily taking notes. Panicky, the graduate picked up a set of course materials that were lying on the registration table and entered without paying. Although the graduate intended to pay the enrollment fee, no one was at the registration table to take her money. After attending the first couple of classes, the graduate sent a cashier's check for the full amount of the enrollment fee to the bar review company. Unbeknownst to the graduate, the bar review course's regional director noticed that she had entered the lectures without paying. After ascertaining her identity from a fellow student who knew the graduate, the company filed a complaint with the local prosecutor, and a warrant was issued for her arrest. The complaint charged the graduate with the crime of larceny by trick, for deliberately failing to pay for services rendered. After the complaint was issued, the graduate's check arrived at the company's office. The company deposited the check but failed to inform the prosecutor that payment had been received. The graduate was arrested and held in custody overnight before the matter was resolved. The graduate suffered severe emotional distress at the publicity she received in the local newspapers and the humiliation she suffered for being arrested and held in police custody. Terribly upset, the graduate was unable to take the bar exam and, thus, lost her job at the entertainment law firm. If the graduate asserts a claim against the bar-review company based on infliction of emotional distress, will she prevail?

Options:

A: Yes, because the graduate did not intend to defraud the company.
B: Yes, because the graduate was unfairly arrested and held in custody overnight.
C: No, because the company was within its rights to file a complaint when it noticed the graduate had attended without paying.
D: No, because filing-the complaint with the prosecutor was not outrageous conduct.
E: Yes, because the graduate ended up losing her job due to the emotional distress caused by the situation.
F: No, because the company did not intend to cause the graduate to suffer severe emotional distress.
G: Yes, because the company did not attempt to contact the graduate before filing a complaint.
H: No, because the graduate did initially attend the course without paying the enrollment fee.
I: Yes, because the company made no effort to inform the prosecutor that the registration fee had been paid in full.
J: No, because the graduate should have pre-enrolled for the course to ensure her spot.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the graduate can successfully claim infliction of emotional distress against the bar-review company. Let me break down the situation step by step.

First, the graduate wanted to take a bar review course but didn't pre-enroll. She planned to pay at registration but got stuck in traffic and arrived late. When she got there, registration was closed, and she took the materials and entered without paying. She intended to pay, but there was no one at the table to take her money. Later, she sent a cashier's check which the company received and deposited. However, the company had already filed a complaint, and she was arrested and held overnight, causing her emotional distress and making her unable to take the bar exam, leading to losing her job.

The question is whether she can sue the company for intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED). To prevail on an IIED claim, the plaintiff must show that the defendant's conduct was outrageous, intentional or reckless, and caused severe emotional distress.

So, let's think about the elements. The company filed a complaint after noticing she attended without paying. At the time they filed, they didn't know she had sent the check yet because it arrived later. So, when they filed the complaint, the graduate had indeed taken the materials and entered without paying, which could be seen as theft or larceny by trick. But she later paid, so maybe the company's actions were unwarranted once they received the payment but didn't inform the prosecutor.

The key here is whether the company's conduct was outrageous. Filing a complaint based on her initial actions might be within their rights, but if they knew or later found out that she paid, continuing to pursue the case could be considered outrageous. However, in this case, the check arrived after the complaint was filed. So when the company filed, they didn't know she intended to pay. But after receiving the payment, they didn't inform the prosecutor, which might be a problem.

The options given are A through J. Let's look at them.

Option A: Yes, because she didn't intend to defraud. But intent to defraud is about her actions, not the company's. Her lack of intent might affect the larceny charge, but for IIED, it's about the company's conduct.

Option B: Yes, because she was unfairly arrested. Unfairness alone isn't enough; the conduct must be outrageous.

Option C: No, because the company was within rights to file when she attended without paying. But after she paid, perhaps their rights changed, and continuing the prosecution could be an issue.

Option D: No, because filing the complaint wasn't outrageous. Filing a complaint based on apparent theft might not be outrageous, but not withdrawing it after payment could be.

Option E: Yes, because she lost her job. Causation is there, but the company's actions must still meet the outrageous standard.

Option F: No, because the company didn't intend to cause distress. IIED requires intent to cause distress or recklessness. If the company knew their actions would cause distress, or were reckless, this could apply. But if they were just pursuing what they thought was a legitimate complaint, maybe not.

Option G: Yes, because the company didn't contact her before filing. Maybe this is about giving her a chance to explain, which could show outrageousness if they didn't attempt to contact her.

Option H: No, because she attended without paying initially. Her initial action was wrong, but again, the company's response is the issue.

Option I: Yes, because the company didn't inform the prosecutor about the payment. This could be outrageous because once they received payment, continuing to prosecute seems unreasonable and could be seen as reckless or intentional infliction of distress.

Option J: No, because she should have pre-enrolled. That's about her responsibility, not the company's conduct.

So, considering the elements: the company filed a complaint based on her initial actions, which they had a right to do. But after receiving the payment, they should have withdrawn the complaint. Failing to do so, especially if they knew she had paid, might constitute outrageous conduct.

Looking at the options, option I says yes because the company didn't inform the prosecutor that the fee was paid. That fits because continuing the prosecution after payment could be seen as outrageous. Alternatively, option D says no because filing wasn't outrageous. But if they continued after knowing she paid, that's different.

Wait, the company filed the complaint before the check arrived. So when they filed, they didn't know she was going to pay. But after the check arrived, they deposited it but didn't tell the prosecutor. So the company's conduct after receiving payment might be the issue. So perhaps the company should have withdrawn the complaint once they received payment. Their failure to do so could be considered outrageous because they knew she had paid but still let the prosecution proceed, leading to her arrest and distress.

So the question is whether the company's action of not informing the prosecutor after receiving payment was outrageous. If so, then IIED applies.

So the correct answer would be I: Yes, because the company made no effort to inform the prosecutor that the fee was paid in full. This could be seen as reckless or intentional, causing her arrest and distress.

To determine whether the graduate can prevail on a claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED) against the bar-review company, it is necessary to analyze the elements of IIED: outrageous conduct, intent or recklessness, and causation of severe emotional distress.

The graduate attended the bar review course without initially paying, but she later sent a cashier's check for the enrollment fee, which the company deposited. However, the company filed a complaint against her before the check arrived and failed to inform the prosecutor that the payment had been received, even after depositing the check. This failure to withdraw the complaint after payment could be considered outrageous, as it led to her arrest, overnight custody, and subsequent emotional distress.

Option I correctly identifies that the company's failure to inform the prosecutor about the payment was a critical factor. This conduct could be deemed outrageous because it was reckless or intentional in allowing the prosecution to continue despite knowing that the graduate had paid the fee. This failure directly caused her severe emotional distress and other consequences.

Other options are less relevant or incorrect. For example, the company's initial filing of the complaint before the payment was received may have been within its rights, but its subsequent inaction after receiving payment crosses the threshold into potentially outrageous conduct. Therefore, the graduate's claim is strongest under Option I.
