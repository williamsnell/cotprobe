Question:

A mail clerk domiciled in State A slipped and fell on ice that had formed near the loading dock of the building in State B where the clerk's State B employer leased space for its headquarters. The building was owned and operated by a State C corporation. As a result of the fall, the clerk was injured and the employer's expensive computer he was carrying was badly damaged. The clerk sued the building owner for negligence in a federal district court in State B, seeking $100,000 in personal-injury damages. The employer has filed a timely motion to intervene, asserting an $80,000 negligence claim against the building owner for the damage to its computer. Is the court likely to grant the employer's motion to intervene?

Options:

A: No, because the employer cannot intervene in a personal injury case.
B: No, because the employer's claim is not directly related to the clerk's personal injury claim.
C: Yes, because the employer also has a direct negligence claim against the building owner.
D: No, because although the employer has an interest in the clerk's action, that interest is not likely to be impaired in the employer's absence.
E: No, because the employer's claim exceeds the amount the clerk is seeking in damages.
F: Yes, because the employer is an indispensable party.
G: Yes, because the employer's claim shares common questions of law and fact with the clerk's action.
H: No, because the clerk chose not to join the employer as a co-plaintiff in his action.

Okay, so I've got this question about federal procedure, specifically about intervention. Hmm, let's try to break it down. 

So the situation is a mail clerk from State A. He was working for an employer in State B. The employer leases space in a building owned by a State C corporation. The clerk slipped on ice near the loading dock in State B and got injured. He was carrying the employer's expensive computer, which was damaged. The clerk sued the building owner in federal district court in State B for $100,000 in personal injury damages. Now, the employer wants to intervene, claiming $80,000 in negligence for the computer damage. The question is whether the court will grant the motion to intervene.

I remember that intervention is governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24. There are two types: intervention as of right (24(a)) and permissive intervention (24(b)). 

Intervention as of right applies when the applicant has an interest in the subject matter, the disposition might impair their ability to protect that interest, and they're not adequately represented by existing parties. Also, the application must be timely.

Permissive intervention requires that the application is timely and that the claim shares a common question of law or fact with the main action.

So, looking at the employer's case: they have a negligence claim against the building owner for damaging their computer. The clerk's claim is for personal injuries. Are their claims related?

I think the employer's claim is based on the same incident—slipping on ice. So the same set of facts, maybe the same negligence claim. The employer might argue that the building owner's negligence caused both the clerk's injury and the computer damage. So the claims share common questions of law and fact. That would support permissive intervention under Rule 24(b).

Alternatively, does the employer have an interest that would be impaired if they don't intervene? The clerk's case is about his personal injuries, while the employer's is about property damage. The building owner's liability could be determined in the clerk's case, which might affect the employer's claim. For example, if the court finds the building owner not negligent in the clerk's case, that could prevent the employer from succeeding in a separate lawsuit. So the employer's interest (recovery for damage) could be impaired if they can't join now. That would make intervention as of right applicable under Rule 24(a).

Wait, but the clerk is suing for personal injury, and the employer's claim is for property damage. Are these interests so distinct that the employer isn't adequately represented by the clerk? The clerk's interests are personal injury, so the employer's property damage claim isn't being represented. So the employer's interest isn't being protected, which is another point for intervention as of right.

But I'm a bit fuzzy on whether the employer's interest is "in the subject matter" of the lawsuit. The subject matter is the incident and the building owner's liability. The employer has a direct stake in that because their property was damaged as a result.

So the employer's motion is timely. The clerk's case is ongoing, so that's fine.

Looking at the options:

Option C says yes because the employer has a direct negligence claim. That makes sense because the employer can sue the building owner directly, so intervention would be appropriate.

Option G says yes because of common questions of law and fact. That's permissive intervention. But the employer might be able to intervene as of right, which doesn't require a motion.

Wait, but the question is about whether the court is likely to grant the motion. If the employer can intervene as of right, the court must grant it. If not, then permissive is discretionary.

In this case, the employer has an interest (the computer damage), the clerk's case could impair the employer's ability to recover if the building owner is found not liable, and the clerk isn't representing the employer's interests. So the court would grant intervention as of right.

Looking at the options, option C and G are possible. Option C says yes because of direct negligence claim. Option G says yes because of common questions.

Wait, Rule 24(a)(2) requires that the moving party's interest may be impaired or they may not be adequately represented. So if the employer doesn't intervene, the clerk's case might determine the building owner's liability, which could affect the employer's separate claim. So the employer's interest is at risk. Therefore, the employer can intervene as of right.

In that case, the correct answer would be C, because the employer has a direct claim. Alternatively, G because of common questions. But wait, the employer's claim is a separate cause of action, same as the clerk's but different damages. So perhaps G is about permissive, but the employer can intervene as of right.

The question is whether the court is likely to grant the motion. Since the employer has a direct claim, the court would allow intervention as of right, so the answer is C.

But let me double-check. Option C says yes because the employer has a direct negligence claim. That's correct. Because the employer can sue the building owner directly, so intervention is appropriate.

Alternatively, option G is about permissive intervention, which is more discretionary. But the court would have to allow it if the employer meets the criteria for intervention as of right.

So the correct answer is C.

To determine whether the court is likely to grant the employer's motion to intervene, we analyze the situation under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24, which governs intervention. There are two types of intervention: intervention as of right under Rule 24(a) and permissive intervention under Rule 24(b).

### Key Analysis:
1. **Intervention as of Right (Rule 24(a))**:
   - The employer has a direct negligence claim against the building owner for the damage to its computer, which arose from the same incident as the clerk's personal injury claim. This establishes the employer's interest in the subject matter of the litigation.
   - The clerk's lawsuit could impair the employer's ability to recover damages if the building owner is found not liable for negligence. For example, a determination that the building owner was not negligent in the clerk's case could preclude the employer from succeeding in a separate lawsuit.
   - The clerk's personal injury claim does not adequately represent the employer's distinct interest in recovering for property damage. Therefore, the employer's interest is not being protected by the existing parties.

   Since the employer meets the criteria under Rule 24(a)—timeliness, an interest in the subject matter, potential impairment of that interest, and inadequate representation—the court is likely to grant intervention as of right.

2. **Permissive Intervention (Rule 24(b))**:
   - The employer's claim shares common questions of law and fact with the clerk's claim, as both arise from the same incident (the slip on the ice) and allege negligence by the building owner. This would support permissive intervention under Rule 24(b).
   - However, permissive intervention is discretionary, whereas intervention as of right is mandatory if the criteria are met. Since the employer qualifies for intervention as of right, this is the stronger basis for granting the motion.

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. The employer can intervene because it has a direct negligence claim, even though the clerk's claim is for personal injury.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The employer's claim is directly related to the clerk's claim because both arise from the same incident and allege negligence by the building owner.
- **Option C**: Correct. The employer has a direct negligence claim against the building owner, which is sufficient to grant intervention as of right.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The employer's interest in recovering for the damaged computer could be impaired if it does not intervene, as the clerk's case may determine the building owner's liability.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The amount of the employer's claim is irrelevant to the decision on intervention.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The employer is not an indispensable party; it merely has an interest in the subject matter.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. While the claims share common questions of law and fact, this supports permissive intervention under Rule 24(b), but the employer is entitled to intervene as of right under Rule 24(a).
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The clerk's decision not to join the employer as a co-plaintiff does not preclude the employer from intervening.

### Conclusion:
The court is likely to grant the employer's motion to intervene because the employer has a direct negligence claim against the building owner because of the property damage caused by the same incident. This entitles the employer to intervene as of right under Rule 24(a).
