Okay, so I've got this problem here about water flowing through a pipe, and I need to find the largest flow rate where the flow is definitely laminar. Hmm, I remember that laminar flow depends on the Reynolds number. Oh right, the critical Reynolds number for pipe flow is around 2100. If the Reynolds number is below that, the flow is laminar.

The pipe's diameter is given as 1 inch. Wait, but I need to make sure all my units are consistent. The kinematic viscosity is given in ft²/s, so I should convert the diameter to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, right? So 1 inch is 1/12 feet. Let me calculate that: 1 divided by 12 is approximately 0.083333 feet.

The formula for Reynolds number (Re) is (velocity * diameter) / kinematic viscosity. But wait, since I'm looking for the maximum flow rate for laminar flow, I should use the critical Re of 2100. 

Flow rate Q is equal to the cross-sectional area multiplied by the velocity. The cross-sectional area of a pipe is πr². Since the diameter is d, radius r is d/2. So the area A is π*(d/2)^2. 

Putting it all together, I can express velocity as Q/A. So substituting into the Re formula: Re = (Q/A * d) / ν. 

Let me write that out: Re = (Q * d) / (A * ν). Since A is π*(d/2)^2, that's π*d²/4. Substituting A back in, Re becomes (Q * d) / ( (π d²/4) * ν ). 

Simplifying this, the d in the numerator cancels with one d in the denominator, leaving Q/( (π d/4) * ν ). Let me rearrange that: Q = Re * (π d/4) * ν.

Wait wait, let me double-check that. Oh right, because Re = (Q d) / (A ν), so solving for Q gives Q = (Re * A * ν) / d. 

Since A is π d²/4, then Q = (Re * π d² ν) / (4 d). The d in the denominator cancels with one d from d squared, leaving d. So Q = (Re * π d ν ) /4.

Wait no, let me do that step again. So (Re * A * ν) / d. A is π (d/2)^2 = π d²/4. So substituting, Q becomes Re * (π d²/4) * ν / d. The d in the denominator cancels with one d in d squared, so it's Re * π d ν /4.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me rederive that.

Re = (V * D) / ν. And Q = V * A, where A is the area, π D²/4. So V is Q/(A). So substituting into Re:

Re = ( (Q/(A)) * D ) / ν. Multiply both sides by A * ν:

Re * A * ν = Q * D.

So Q = (Re * A * ν) / D.

Now, A is π D²/4. So substituting:

Q = (Re * (π D²/4) * ν ) / D. 

Simplify the D terms: D² / D = D. So Q = (Re * π D ν ) /4.

Yes, that's correct. So Q = (Re * π * D * ν) /4.

Now plug in the numbers. Re is 2100. D is 1 inch, which is 1/12 feet. ν is 0.1e-4 ft²/s.

So let's compute each part step by step.

First, calculate D in feet: 1/12 = approximately 0.083333 ft.

Then, compute Re * π: 2100 * π. Let me approximate π as 3.1416. So 2100 *3.1416 is about 2100*3=6300, 2100*0.1416= approx 2100 *0.14=294, 2100 *0.0016=3.36. So total is 6300 +294=6594 +3.36=6597.36.

Wait, no. Because 2100 * 0.1416 = let's compute it accurately. 2000 *0.1416=283.2, 100*0.1416=14.16. So total 283.2+14.16=297.36. So 2100 * π ≈ 2100 *3.1416= 6597.36.

Next, multiply by D (0.083333 ft) and ν (0.1e-4 ft²/s). So let's compute each step.

So the formula is Q = (2100 * π * D * ν ) /4.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the formula is Q = (Re * π * D * ν ) /4. Because in the earlier step, Q = (Re * π D ν ) /4.

Wait, perhaps I should write all the factors:

Q = (Re * π * D * ν) /4.

So let's plug in the numbers:

Re = 2100.

D = 1/12 ft.

ν = 0.1e-4 ft²/s = 1e-5 ft²/s.

So substituting:

Q = (2100 * π * (1/12) * 1e-5 ) /4.

Let me compute the numerator first: 2100 * π * (1/12) * 1e-5.

Compute 2100 * (1/12) first. 2100 /12 = 175.

So 175 * π * 1e-5.

175 * π is approximately 175 *3.1416 ≈ 549.78.

So 549.78e-5 = 0.0054978.

Now multiply by 1/4: 0.0054978 /4 = 0.00137445 ft³/s.

Wait, 0.0054978 divided by 4. Let me compute that. 0.0054978 /4 is 0.00137445.

So approximately 1.37445e-3 ft³/s.

Looking at the options, let's see which is close to 0.001374, which is 1.374e-3 ft³/s.

The options are:

A: 1.08e-3

B:1.18e-3

C:1.05e-3

D:1.38e-3

E:1.28e-3

F:1.22e-3

G:1.68e-3

H:1.58e-3

I:1.48e-3

J:1.98e-3.

Hmm, my calculation is approximately 1.374e-3, which is close to option D:1.38e-3, but perhaps my approximations are a bit off, maybe I should do a more precise calculation.

Let me recalculate with more precise numbers.

D = 1 inch = 0.0833333333 ft.

ν = 1e-5 ft²/s.

Re = 2100.

So Q = (2100 * π * 0.0833333333 * 1e-5) /4.

Calculate step by step.

2100 * 0.0833333333 = 2100 * (1/12) = 175.

Then 175 * π = 175 *3.1415926535 = let me compute that.

175 *3 =525.

175 *0.1415926535: 175 *0.1=17.5, 175 *0.0415926535≈175 *0.04=7. So 17.5+7=24.5. But more accurately:

0.0415926535 *175:

= (0.04 *175) + (0.00159265 *175)

0.04 *175=7.

0.00159265 *175= approx 0.2788.

So total is 7 +0.2788=7.2788.

So 0.04159265 *175 ≈7.2788.

So 175 * π ≈525 +24.5? Wait, wait no. Wait, 3.14159265 is 3 + 0.14159265. So 175*(3 +0.14159265) = 175*3 +175*0.14159265.

Which is 525 + (175*0.14159265).

Compute 175 *0.14159265:

Break it down: 0.1 *175 =17.5

0.04 *175=7.

0.00159265 *175≈0.2788.

So 0.14159265 is 0.1 +0.04 +0.00159265.

So 17.5 +7 =24.5, plus 0.2788 →24.7788.

So 175 *π is 525 +24.7788=549.7788.

So 549.7788 *1e-5 = 0.005497788 ft³/s.

Wait, no, because this is (2100 * π * D * ν) → 2100 * π is 6597.426, but D is 1/12 so 6597.426 * (1/12) = 549.7855, then multiply by ν (1e-5), so 549.7855e-5 = 0.005497855.

Then divide by 4: 0.005497855 /4 = 0.00137421375 ft³/s.

So approximately 0.0013742 ft³/s, which is 1.3742e-3 ft³/s.

Looking at the options, option D is 1.38e-3, which is 0.00138, which is a bit higher than our calculation. Option F is 1.22e-3, which is lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me double-check.

Wait, the formula I used was Q = (Re * π * D * ν) /4. 

But wait, earlier when I derived Q, I had Q = (Re * A * ν) / D, and A is π D²/4. So substituting, Q = Re * (π D²/4) * ν / D.

Which simplifies to Re * π D ν /4. So that part seems correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me recalculate:

Re =2100.

D =1 inch =1/12 ft.

ν=1e-5 ft²/s.

Q = (2100 * π * (1/12) * 1e-5 ) /4.

Compute each part step by step.

2100 * (1/12) = 175.

175 * π = 549.7786.

549.7786 *1e-5 = 0.005497786.

0.005497786 /4 = 0.0013744465.

So about 0.0013744 ft³/s, which is 1.3744e-3.

Looking at the options, the closest to this would be option D:1.38e-3, which is 1.38 ×10^-3.

But wait, let me check my calculation again to see if I made any mistake. Let me compute 2100*(1/12) =175. Correct.

175 * π=175 *3.14159265=549.7786. Correct.

Then multiply by 1e-5: 549.7786e-5 =0.005497786.

Divide by 4: 0.005497786 /4=0.0013744465. Correct.

So that's approximately 1.3744e-3 ft³/s. The options don't have that exact value, but option D is 1.38e-3, which is close. But wait, perhaps I should check the exact calculation without approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another approach: velocity V is Q/A. Re = (V D)/ ν. So Re = (Q D)/(A ν).

Solving for Q: Q = (Re A ν)/D.

A = π (D/2)^2 = π D²/4.

So Q = Re * (π D²/4) * ν / D.

Simplify: Re * π D ν /4.

Which is the same as I did earlier.

So perhaps the calculation is correct. Let me compute it using exact fractions.

D =1/12 ft.

ν=0.1e-4 ft²/s = 1e-5 ft²/s.

Compute Q = (2100 * π * (1/12) * 1e-5 ) /4.

Let me write it as (2100 * π) / (12 *4) ) * 1e-5.

12*4=48.

So 2100 /48 = 43.75.

So 43.75 * π *1e-5.

43.75 * π = 43.75 *3.14159265.

Let me compute that:

40 *3.14159265 =125.663706.

3.75 *3.14159265: 3 *3.14159=9.42477, 0.75 *3.14159=2.35619. So 9.42477+2.35619=11.78096.

So total is 125.663706 +11.78096=137.444666.

Then multiply by 1e-5: 137.444666e-5 = 0.00137444666 ft³/s.

Which is exactly what I got before. So 1.3744e-3 ft³/s.

Looking at the options again, the closest is option D:1.38e-3. But wait, perhaps I miscalculated the options. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 1.08 ×10^-3

B:1.18e-3

C:1.05e-3

D:1.38e-3

E:1.28e-3

F:1.22e-3

G:1.68e-3

H:1.58e-3

I:1.48e-3

J:1.98e-3.

Hmm, option D is 1.38e-3, which is 0.00138. My calculation is 0.0013744, which is very close. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in unit conversions.

Wait, diameter is 1 inch. I converted that to feet correctly as 1/12 ft. Correct.

But wait, what is the standard formula for flow rate when Re is given?

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula Q_max = (π D^2 /4) * V_max, where V_max is the maximum velocity before turbulence occurs. And V_max is when Re = 2100 = V*D/ν → V = (Re * ν)/D.

So V = (2100 * 1e-5) / (1/12 ft) → (2100 * 1e-5 *12) ft/s.

Compute that: 2100 *12 =25200.

25200 *1e-5= 0.252 ft/s.

Then Q = A * V = (π (0.083333)^2 /4) *0.252.

Compute A: π*(0.083333)^2 /4.

0.083333 squared is approx 0.00694444.

Multiply by π: 0.00694444 *3.1416 ≈0.0218168.

Divide by 4: 0.0218168 /4 ≈0.0054542 ft².

Then multiply by velocity 0.252 ft/s: 0.0054542 *0.252 ≈0.0013746 ft³/s.

Same result as before. So approximately 1.3746e-3 ft³/s.

So the closest option is D:1.38e-3. However, looking at the options, perhaps I should check the options again.

Wait, let me read the options correctly. Let me list all options with their exponents:

Option D: 1.38 ×10^-3 → 0.00138.

Option F:1.22e-3 →0.00122.

Option H:1.58e-3 →0.00158.

So my calculation is 0.001374, which is 1.374e-3, which is just slightly below 1.38e-3.

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation would lead to 1.374, which is not exactly any of the options, but D is the closest. Alternatively, perhaps the options were calculated using more precise values of π.

Wait, let me compute using more precise π. Let me use π=3.141592653589793.

So 175 * π: 175 *3.141592653589793 = ?

Calculating 175 *3 =525, 175 *0.141592653589793 = ?

0.1 *175=17.5.

0.04*175=7.

0.001592653589793 *175 ≈0.2788.

So 17.5+7=24.5 +0.2788=24.7788.

So 175 *π=525 +24.7788=549.7788.

So same as before.

Then 549.7788 *1e-5 = 0.005497788.

Divide by4: 0.001374447.

So approximately 1.3744e-3.

So no, it's still the same. So the closest option is D, but perhaps the options have a typo, or perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should have used the hydraulic diameter, which for a pipe is the same as the diameter. So no issue there.

Wait, am I using the correct value for ν? The question says kinematic viscosity is 0.1 ×10^-4 ft²/s. So 0.1e-4 is 1e-5. Correct.

Hmm, perhaps the options are computed with a different Re_c? Wait, the question says Re_c is approximately 2100, which I used.

Wait, perhaps the velocity formula is V= (Re ν)/D.

Wait, yes: V= (Re * ν)/D. So V= 2100 *1e-5 / (1/12).

Which is 2100 *1e-5 *12 = 2100 *12 *1e-5.

2100*12
