Okay, so I've got this question about when early email was developed, and I need to pick the right decade from the options given. Let me think through this step by step.

I remember that email, as we know it today, is a relatively recent development, but its origins go back further. I think the basics of email started before the internet became widely used. Wait, the internet itself became popular in the 1990s, right? So maybe email was developed before that.

I've heard that the first email systems were created in the 1970s. There was something about a guy named Ray Tomlinson who sent the first email. I think he's the one who introduced the @ symbol in email addresses. That was a big deal because it allowed messages to be sent between different computer systems, not just within the same network.

So if Ray Tomlinson did that in the 70s, then early email must have been developed in the 1970s. Let me double-check the timeline. The ARPANET, which was a precursor to the internet, started in the late 1960s and expanded in the 70s. Email was one of the first applications on ARPANET, so that fits the 1970s timeframe.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I also remember that in the 1980s, email started to become more widely used, especially with the rise of personal computers and online services like CompuServe. But the actual development and first use would have been earlier.

So looking at the options, the choices are A to J, each representing a decade. The options are:
A: 1900s
B: 1920s
C: 2000s
D: 1990s
E: 1960s
F: 1930s
G: 1970s
H: 1950s
I: 1980s
J: 1940s

From my reasoning, the correct decade is the 1970s, which is option G. So the answer should be G.

The development of early email can be traced back to the 1970s, with significant contributions such as the introduction of the @ symbol by Ray Tomlinson, which allowed communication between different computer systems. This aligns with the emergence of ARPANET, a precursor to the modern internet, during the same period. 

Answer: G
