Okay, so I've got this problem about gas transport between two vessels connected by a tube. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The problem has two parts, I and II. Let's tackle part I first. So, what's given? The vessels have gases A and B at the same pressure and temperature, which are 1 atm and 40°F. But their concentrations are different: 85 mole percent in one and 7 in the other. The tube connecting them is 9 inches long with an inside diameter of 1.5 inches. The diffusivity D_AB is 1.75 ft²/hr. I need to find the steady-state rate of transport of gas A.

Wait, I remember that for molecular diffusion in a tube, Fick's Law is used. Fick's first law for mass transfer is probably the way to go here. The formula is N_A = (D_AB * A * (C_A1 - C_A2)) / L, where N_A is the molar flux, D is diffusivity, A is the area, and L is the length of the tube. Oh wait, but wait—wait, isn't it (C_A1 - C_A2) divided by L? No, wait, no, the concentration gradient is (C_A1 - C_A2)/L, but in Fick's law, the flux is D multiplied by the concentration gradient. So, N_A would be D * A * (C_A1 - C_A2) / L.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. Fick's Law is N = -D*(dc/dx). But when applying it for a tube, the molar flux (N) through the tube would be D * A * (C1 - C2) / L, since the concentration difference is across length L.

So the molar flux N_A is (D_AB * A * (C_A1 - C_A2)) / L.

But wait, the concentrations here are given in mole percent. Oh, right, because the total pressure is the same, the partial pressures are proportional to mole fractions. So the concentrations can be taken as mole fractions. But wait, no—concentration in Fick's law is molar concentration, like moles per volume. Or wait, maybe in this case, since it's gases and the pressure is constant, the mole fractions can be used directly because of ideal gas behavior.

Wait, let me clarify. The ideal gas law is PV = nRT, so concentration (n/V) is P/(RT). But since both gases are at the same pressure and temperature, the total concentration (n/V) is the same in both vessels. So the difference in mole fractions would directly translate into a difference in concentrations (moles per volume) because C_A = y_A * (P/(RT)), where y is mole fraction.

So for the vessel with 85% A, C_A1 = 0.85 * (P/(RT)), and C_A2 = 0.07 * (P/(RT)). So the difference (C_A1 - C_A2) is (0.85 - 0.07) * (P/(RT)) = 0.78 * (P/(RT)).

Wait, but since both are at the same P and T, the ratio (C_A1 - C_A2) can be expressed as (y_A1 - y_A2) * (P/(RT)). But since P and T are same in both vessels, maybe that part simplifies.

Alternatively, maybe we can model it directly using mole fractions, because the overall concentration (P/(RT)) is the same everywhere. Let me think: since for ideal gases, the molar concentration is proportional to pressure over RT, which is same in both vessels. So if the mole fraction of A is different, the actual concentration is y_A times (P/(RT)). So the concentration difference is (y_A1 - y_A2) * (P/(RT)).

So the flux equation becomes N_A = (D_AB * A * (y_A1 - y_A2) * (P/(RT))) / L.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think if there's a simpler approach. Because the process is at steady state and the tube is connecting two vessels, perhaps it's better to model it using the formula for diffusion rate as N_A = (D_AB * A (C_A1 - C_A2)) / L.

But I need to compute C_A1 and C_A2. Since both are at same P and T, C = n/V = P/(RT). So C_total = P/(RT). Then, C_A = y_A * C_total. So C_A1 = 0.85 * (P/(RT)), and C_A2 = 0.07 * (P/(RT)). So the difference is 0.78 * (P/(RT)).

Hence, N_A = [D_AB * A * (0.78 * P/(RT))] / L.

Wait, but D_AB is given in ft²/hr. Let me make sure the units are consistent.

Wait, what's the value of P? It's 1 atm. R is the gas constant. R is 10.73 ft·lb/(lb·mol·°R) when using units compatible with lb, ft, etc. Wait, wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the units. Let me try to compute this step by step.

First, compute the concentration difference.

P = 1 atm.

R = 10.73 (ft·lb)/(lb·mol·°R) because for R, the value is 10.73 when using lb-mol units.

T is 40°F. Wait, but R is in terms of absolute temperature, so we need to convert 40°F to Rankine.

40°F in Rankine is 40 + 459.67 = 499.67 °R.

So, C_total = P/(R*T) = (1 atm) / (10.73 ft·lb/(lb·mol·°R) * 499.67 °R).

Wait, but 1 atm is equal to 14.695 psia, which is 14.695 lb/in². But perhaps I need to convert that into lb/ft², because the area is in ft².

Wait, perhaps another approach is better. Let me think in terms of units.

Wait, D_AB is in ft²/hr. Area is in ft², length L in ft. The concentration is in lb-moles per ft³.

So, let me compute C_A1 and C_A2 in lb-mol/ft³.

So, C = P/(RT). P is 1 atm. Let me convert 1 atm to lb/ft². 1 atm is 2116.2 lb/ft².

R is 10.73 ft·lb/(lb·mol·°R). T is 40°F = 499.67 °R.

So,

C = (2116.2 lb/ft²) / (10.73 ft·lb/(lb·mol·°R) * 499.67 °R).

Simplify the denominator:

10.73 * 499.67 ≈ Let's compute that:

10 * 500 is 5000, so 10.73 * 499.67 ≈ 10.73 * 500 = 5365. So approximately 5365 ft·lb/(lb·mol) ?

Wait no, the units would be (ft·lb/(lb·mol·°R)) * °R) gives ft·lb/(lb·mol). So denominator is 5365 ft·lb/(lb·mol).

So C = 2116.2 lb/ft² / (5365 ft·lb/(lb·mol)) )

Wait, let's see the units: lb/ft² divided by (ft·lb)/(lb·mol) ) → (lb/ft²) * (lb·mol)/(ft·lb) ) = (lb·mol)/(ft³).

Yes, correct.

So, compute 2116.2 / 5365 ≈ 0.3945 lb·mol/ft³.

So C_total ≈ 0.3945 lb·mol/ft³.

So C_A1 = 0.85 * 0.3945 ≈ 0.3353 lb·mol/ft³.

C_A2 = 0.07 * 0.3945 ≈ 0.0276 lb·mol/ft³.

So the concentration difference is 0.3353 - 0.0276 = 0.3077 lb·mol/ft³.

Now, the tube's dimensions: length L is 9 inches, which is 0.75 ft. The diameter is 1.5 inches, so radius is 0.75 inches. Wait, area A is π r². But wait, 1.5 inches is the diameter, so radius is 0.75 inches. Convert inches to feet: 0.75 inches = 0.75/12 = 0.0625 ft.

So radius r = 0.0625 ft. So area A = π (0.0625)^2 = π * 0.00390625 ≈ 0.01227 ft².

Alternatively, diameter is 1.5 inches, which is 1.5/12 = 0.125 ft. So radius is 0.0625 ft. So same as above.

So A ≈ 0.01227 ft².

Now, N_A is (D_AB * A * (C_A1 - C_A2)) / L.

D_AB is 1.75 ft²/hr.

So plug in the numbers:

N_A = (1.75 * 0.01227 * 0.3077) / 0.75.

Let me compute step by step.

1.75 * 0.01227 = approx 0.02147.

0.02147 * 0.3077 ≈ 0.00660.

Divide by 0.75: 0.00660 / 0.75 ≈ 0.0088 lb·mol/hr.

Wait, but let me compute more accurately.

Compute 1.75 * 0.01227 = 1.75 * 0.01227.

Let me compute 1.75 * 0.01227:

0.01227 * 1.75 = 0.0214725.

Then 0.0214725 * 0.3077.

Let me compute 0.0214725 * 0.3077.

0.02 * 0.3077 = 0.006154.

0.0014725 * 0.3077 ≈ 0.0004528.

Adding up: 0.006154 + 0.0004528 ≈ 0.0066068.

Now, divide by 0.75: 0.0066068 / 0.75 ≈ 0.008808 lb·mol/hr.

Wait, but wait, that's about 8.8 × 10^-3 lb·mol/hr. But the options are in the order of 1e-4 to 1e-5. So maybe I made a mistake in units.

Wait a second, perhaps I messed up the concentration calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, C = P/(R*T). Wait, P in lb/ft², R in ft·lb/(lb·mol·°R), T in °R.

So P = 1 atm = 2116.2 lb/ft².

R = 10.73 ft·lb/(lb·mol·°R).

T = 40 F = 499.67 °R.

So C = 2116.2 / (10.73 * 499.67) = 2116.2 / (5365.2) ≈ 0.3945 lb·mol/ft³. That seems correct.

C_A1 = 0.85 * 0.3945 = 0.3353 lb·mol/ft³.

C_A2 = 0.07 * 0.3945 = 0.027615 lb·mol/ft³.

C_A1 - C_A2 = 0.30768 lb·mol/ft³.

So that's correct.

Area A: 1.5" diameter is 0.125 ft, so radius is 0.0625 ft. Area is π*(0.0625)^2 = π*(0.00390625) ≈ 0.01227 ft². Correct.

Length L = 9 inches = 0.75 ft. Correct.

So N_A = (1.75 ft²/hr * 0.01227 ft² * 0.30768 lb·mol/ft³) / 0.75 ft.

Wait, let me compute the numerator: 1.75 * 0.01227 = 0.0214725; then times 0.30768: 0.0214725 * 0.30768 ≈ 0.006606 lb·mol/(ft·hr) because ft² * ft² * (lb·mol/ft³) would be (ft^4 * lb·mol/ft³) = ft * lb·mol. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing units here. Let me think:

Wait, D is in ft²/hr, area in ft², concentration difference in lb·mol/ft³, so D*A gives (ft²/hr)*ft² = ft^4/hr. Multiply by (lb·mol/ft³) gives (ft^4 * lb·mol) / (hr * ft³) ) = (ft * lb·mol) / hr. Divided by L (ft), so overall (ft * lb·mol/hr ) / ft ) = lb·mol/hr. Correct.

So N_A = [1.75 * 0.01227 * 0.30768 ] / 0.75.

Compute numerator: 1.75 * 0.01227 = 0.0214725.

0.0214725 * 0.30768 = as before, 0.006606.

Divide by 0.75: 0.008808 lb·mol/hr.

Wait, but 0.0088 lb·mol/hr is 8.8 × 10^-3 lb·mol/hr. But the options are all in the 1e-4 to 1e-5 range. That suggests I made a mistake somewhere. Let me check the calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to account for the correct units in the concentration. Another possibility is that the formula I'm using is incorrect.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula should be N_A = (D_AB * A * (C_A1 - C_A2)) / L. So, yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the mole fraction difference multiplied by the total concentration, which I did. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the area is incorrect. Let me recalculate the area. The tube is 1.5 inches in diameter, so radius is 0.75 inches, which is 0.0625 ft. Area is π*(0.0625)^2 = π*(0.00390625) ft².

0.00390625 * π ≈ 0.01227 ft². That seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the logarithmic mean concentration difference because the vessels are well mixed and large, but no, the problem says steady state, so Fick's law applies directly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units for the concentration. Let me recompute C.

Wait, perhaps I should use R as 10.73 psia·ft³/(lb·mol·°R) or something? Wait, wait, no, R is 10.73 (ft·lb)/(lb·mol·°R). So yes, the calculation was correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of C. Let me compute 2116.2 / (10.73 * 499.67) again.

Compute denominator: 10.73 * 499.67. Let me compute 10 * 499.67 = 4996.7; 0.73 * 499.67 ≈ 364. So total is approx 4996.7 + 364 = 5360.7. So 2116.2 / 5360.7 ≈ 0.3947 lb·mol/ft³. Correct.

C_A1 = 0.85 * 0.3947 ≈ 0.335 lb·mol/ft³.

C_A2 = 0.07 * 0.3947 ≈ 0.0276 lb·mol/ft³.

Difference is 0.3074 lb·mol/ft³.

So then, N_A = (1.75 * 0.01227 * 0.3074) / 0.75.

Compute 1.75 * 0.01227 = 0.02147.

0.02147 * 0.3074 ≈ 0.00659.

0.00659 / 0.75 ≈ 0.008786 lb·mol/hr.

Hmm, but the options don't have this value. Wait, the options are all around 1e-5. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of C.

Wait, wait another thought: perhaps the tube's diameter is 1.5 inches, but is that the inner diameter? Yes, as per the problem statement, it's inside diameter 1.5 in.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to convert inches to feet correctly. Let me recheck.

1.5 inches = 1.5/12 = 0.125 ft. So radius is 0.0625 ft. Area is π*(0.0625)^2 = 0.01227 ft². That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the formula. Let me think again. Oh wait! I think I might have confused mass transfer with molar transfer. Wait, but the question asks for the rate in lb moles per hour, which is correct. So perhaps the mistake is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the concentration in terms of partial pressures. Wait, another approach.

Since the gases are ideal, the molar flux can be calculated using the formula:

N_A = (D_AB * A * P * (y_A1 - y_A2)) / (R*T*L)

Wait, because C_A = y_A * P/(R*T), so the concentration difference is (y_A1 - y_A2)*P/(R*T). So substituting back into N_A = D * A * (C_A1 - C_A2) / L.

So N_A = (D_AB * A * (P/(R*T)) * (y_A1 - y_A2)) / L.

So plug in the numbers:

D_AB = 1.75 ft²/hr.

A = 0.01227 ft².

P = 1 atm = 2116.2 lb/ft².

R = 10.73 ft·lb/(lb·mol·°R).

T = 40°F = 499.67 °R.
