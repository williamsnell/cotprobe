Question:

A testator died and through his will gave his entire estate to charity, but the gift failed because the will was executed 10 days prior to the testator's death. A man then filed a claim against the estate, alleging that he was the son and heir of the testator. At the trial on the man's claim, the man was unable to produce any proof of a ceremonial marriage, but established the following by undisputed evidence: (a) that his mother and the testator had cohabited for a number of years; and (b) that his mother had predeceased the testator by one day. Assume that this jurisdiction has a relevant Dead Man's Statute in effect. At trial, the man's attorney called a clerk at a winter resort hotel. The clerk testified that the testator and the man's mother had come to the hotel for many years and he often saw the testator sign the hotel register as "Mr. and Mrs. Testator. "The trial court should rule the clerk's testimony

Options:

A: inadmissible, under the Dead Man's Statute.
B: inadmissible, because it is a violation of the testator's privacy.
C: admissible as a pedigree exception to the hearsay rule.
D: admissible, as it falls under the exception to the hearsay rule for statements of personal or family history.
E: admissible, because it provides evidence of the couple's public recognition as husband and wife.
F: inadmissible, because the clerk's testimony is not the best evidence.
G: inadmissible, because the clerk's testimony is considered hearsay.
H: admissible, as it provides evidence of a common law marriage.
I: admissible, because the clerk had personal knowledge of the matter.
J: inadmissible, as the hotel register is not a legal document establishing marriage.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence question. Let me read through it again carefully.

The scenario is about a testator who died, leaving his entire estate to charity in his will. But the gift failed because the will was executed 10 days before his death. Now, a man is claiming to be the testator's son and heir. He's trying to prove this in court but couldn't produce any proof of a ceremonial marriage. However, he did show two things: (a) his mother and the testator lived together for years, and (b) his mother died just one day before the testator.

The jurisdiction has a Dead Man's Statute in effect. At the trial, the man's attorney called a hotel clerk who testified that the testator and the man's mother came to the hotel for many years. The clerk often saw the testator sign the hotel register as "Mr. and Mrs. Testator." The question is about whether this testimony is admissible.

The options are from A to J, each giving a different reason for admissibility or inadmissibility.

First, I need to recall what the Dead Man's Statute says. As I remember, a Dead Man's Statute, also known as the hearsay exception for statements of a deceased person, often allows certain statements made by a deceased person to be admissible in court when the deceased is a party to the case. But wait, I think it's more about when a party is deceased, their statements can be used against their estate or in cases involving their estate. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact application here.

The clerk is testifying about what the testator wrote on the hotel register. So the testator is deceased, and the clerk is testifying about the testator's statements (signing as Mr. and Mrs.). So under the Dead Man's Statute, the testator's statements might be admissible against his estate. But wait, the Dead Man's Statute typically prevents a witness from testifying about statements made by a deceased person if the deceased's estate is a party and the statement is being offered against the estate. Or is it the other way around?

Alternatively, the Dead Man's Statute might prevent a party from testifying about a conversation with a deceased person when the deceased's estate is the opposing party. So in this case, the testator is the deceased, and the man is claiming to be his heir. The estate is the opposing party here because if the man is an heir, he would take from the estate. So the clerk's testimony is about the testator's statements (signing the register), which might be hearsay unless an exception applies.

Wait, the Dead Man's Statute could make the testator's statements inadmissible if they are being used against his estate. But in this case, the man is trying to prove he's the testator's son. So he's trying to get into the estate. So the testator's statements would be admissible for the man, but wait, the Dead Man's Statute might prevent that.

But maybe the Dead Man's Statute doesn't apply here because the testator's own statements are being used by the claimant, not the estate. Or perhaps the Dead Man's Statute is meant to prevent the estate from being bound by the testator's statements when the testator can't testify. I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, let's think about hearsay. The clerk is testifying to the testator's written statement (signing as Mr. and Mrs.). That would typically be hearsay because it's an out-of-court statement offered for the truth of the matter—that is, to show that the testator considered himself married, which would support the man's claim of being his son.

But there are exceptions to hearsay. The options mention pedigree exception, statements of personal or family history, etc. The pedigree exception allows statements about a person's family lineage, like parentage, which are admissible if they're made in a context where the declarant would have had knowledge. So if the testator referred to the man's mother as his wife, that might fall under the pedigree exception.

Wait, but the pedigree exception is for statements about a person's family, made by someone with knowledge, and typically made before the controversy arose. The testator's statements on the hotel register would be such statements. So under the pedigree exception, the testator's statements could be admissible as an exception to hearsay.

Additionally, the testator is deceased, so his statements would be hearsay, but if they fall under an exception like pedigree, they could come in. However, the Dead Man's Statute might still apply. Wait, the Dead Man's Statute in some jurisdictions says that a party cannot testify about a conversation with a deceased person if the deceased's estate is a party. But here, the testator's statements are being offered through the clerk, not the claimant. So perhaps the Dead Man's Statute doesn't apply because it's not the opposing party (the estate) offering the statement, but the claimant.

Alternatively, the clerk's testimony is about the testator's actions (signing the register), which may be admissible as a form of adoptive admission under FRE 801(d)(2)(B), but I'm not sure if that applies here. Or perhaps it's non-hearsay because it's evidence of the testator's state of mind—his belief that he was married.

Wait, but the purpose here is to show that the testator held himself out as married to the man's mother, which would be relevant to establishing a common-law marriage or at least cohabitation, supporting the man's claim of parentage.

Looking at the options, option E says it's admissible because it provides evidence of the couple's public recognition as husband and wife. That might make sense because the testator's public representation could be relevant. But I'm not sure if that's a specific hearsay exception or just relevance.

Option C says it's admissible as a pedigree exception to hearsay. That could be the case because it's about family history. Option D mentions statements of personal or family history, which is similar.

Wait, the testator's statements would be about his own family, so they could fall under the pedigree exception. However, the pedigree exception typically applies to statements by a family member about the family, not necessarily the individual's own statements. But I'm not entirely certain.

Another angle: the clerk's testimony is about what the testator wrote, which is an out-of-court statement offered for the truth (that they were husband and wife). So it's hearsay unless an exception applies.

Option I says it's admissible because the clerk had personal knowledge. Well, the clerk did see the testator sign the register, so yes, that's personal knowledge. But the issue is whether the content is hearsay. So even if the clerk has personal knowledge, the statement's content is still hearsay unless an exception applies.

Option G says it's inadmissible because it's hearsay, but if an exception applies, G would be incorrect.

The Dead Man's Statute (option A) would make it inadmissible if the testator's statements are being used against his estate. But I'm not sure if the Dead Man's Statute applies here because the testator's own statements are being used by the claimant, not the estate. Or perhaps the Dead Man's Statute prevents the estate from being bound by the testator's statements when the testator can't testify, but here the claimant is using the testator's statements against the estate, so maybe the Dead Man's Statute doesn't bar it.

Wait, I think the Dead Man's Statute typically applies when a party (like the estate) is trying to use the deceased's statements. If the opposing party (the claimant) is using the deceased's statements, the Dead Man's Statute might not apply. So perhaps option A is incorrect.

So, considering all this, the clerk's testimony is about the testator's statements, which are hearsay, but they might fall under the pedigree exception or the personal or family history exception. So options C, D, E, or I could be possible.

Option E says it's admissible because it shows public recognition as husband and wife. That seems more about the fact that they held themselves out as married, which could be relevant to establishing a common-law marriage or to show cohabitation, supporting the claim of parentage.

Option H suggests it's about a common-law marriage. If the jurisdiction recognizes common-law marriage, then evidence of holding out as husband and wife could be relevant. But the question doesn't specify whether common-law marriage is recognized, so I'm not sure if H is the right answer.

Option I says it's admissible because the clerk had personal knowledge. But the hearsay issue remains, so I think I is not the correct reason.

So, putting it together: The clerk's testimony is hearsay, but it might be admissible under an exception. The Dead Man's Statute might not bar it because it's the claimant using the testator's statements, not the estate. So options C, D, or E are possible.

Looking back, the pedigree exception (option C) applies to statements about family history. The testator's statement that he's Mr. and Mrs. Testator implies that the man's mother was his wife, so that's about family history. Therefore, it might fall under the pedigree exception, making option C correct.

Alternatively, option D says it's admissible under the exception for statements of personal or family history. That's similar to the pedigree exception. So perhaps D is correct.

Wait, the Federal Rules have specific exceptions. The pedigree exception is covered under FRE 804(b)(4), which allows statements about a person's family, marriage, etc., made by a person with knowledge, and while the declarant was in a position to know. So the testator's statements on the register would qualify as statements about his marriage, thus admissible under the pedigree exception.

So option C says it's admissible as a pedigree exception to the hearsay rule. That seems correct.

But wait, another thought: The Dead Man's Statute could still apply. If the clerk is testifying about the testator's out-of-court statement, and the testator is dead, the Dead Man's Statute in some jurisdictions prohibits such testimony when it's offered against the testator's estate. So in this case, the man is trying to take from the estate, so the estate is the opposing party. Therefore, the Dead Man's Statute would prevent the clerk from testifying about the testator's statements because they're being used against the estate.

So if the Dead Man's Statute applies, then option A would be correct, making the testimony inadmissible.

Wait, I'm getting conflicting possibilities here. Let me think again. The Dead Man's Statute varies by jurisdiction, but generally, it prohibits a witness from testifying about a conversation or transaction with a deceased person when the deceased's estate is a party and the statement is being offered against the estate.

In this case, the testator's statement is being offered by the claimant (the man) to establish his claim against the estate. So the statement is being offered against the estate. Therefore, the Dead Man's Statute would prohibit the clerk from testifying about the testator's statements because it's the testator's own statements being used against his estate.

So that would make option A correct: inadmissible under the Dead Man's Statute.

But wait, some jurisdictions allow certain exceptions to the Dead Man's Statute, such as the pedigree exception or statements of family history. So even if the Dead Man's Statute applies, if the statement falls under an exception to hearsay, it might still be admissible.

Alternatively, the Dead Man's Statute and the hearsay rules are separate. So even if the Dead Man's Statute doesn't apply, the statement could still be inadmissible as hearsay unless an exception applies.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to outline:

1. Clerk's testimony is about testator's out-of-court statement (signing as Mr. and Mrs.), so it's hearsay.

2. To be admissible, it needs a hearsay exception.

3. Possible exceptions: pedigree (804(b)(4)), or statement about personal history (maybe 804(b)(5) or another rule).

4. Dead Man's Statute: if it applies, it could make the statement inadmissible when offered against the estate.

So if the Dead Man's Statute applies, the testimony is inadmissible regardless of hearsay exceptions? Or does the Dead Man's Statute only apply to certain situations?

I think the Dead Man's Statute is a separate rule from hearsay. So even if the statement is hearsay and has an exception, the Dead Man's Statute might still make it inadmissible. Or perhaps the Dead Man's Statute is a type of hearsay rule.

Wait, the Dead Man's Statute is often considered an evidence rule that prohibits certain testimony, not necessarily a hearsay rule. So even if the statement is hearsay and has an exception, the Dead Man's Statute could still prevent it from being admitted.

Alternatively, some jurisdictions hold that if the statement falls under a hearsay exception (like pedigree), then the Dead Man's Statute does not apply. But I'm not sure.

In this question, the clerk's testimony is about the testator's statements. If the Dead Man's Statute in this jurisdiction prohibits such testimony when offered against the estate, then the testimony is inadmissible, regardless of whether it's hearsay.

So, looking at the options, option A says it's inadmissible under the Dead Man's Statute. Option G says it's inadmissible as hearsay. So which applies?

If the Dead Man's Statute applies, then A would be correct. If the testimony is hearsay but has an exception, then the Dead Man's Statute might not bar it.

But I think in this scenario, the Dead Man's Statute would prevent the testimony because it's the testator's own statements being used against his estate. So the answer would be A.

But wait, another thought: The Dead Man's Statute typically applies when the witness is testifying about a conversation or transaction with the deceased. Here, the clerk didn't have a conversation with the testator but is testifying about the testator's act of signing the register. So maybe the Dead Man's Statute doesn't apply because it's not a conversation, but rather a written statement by the testator.

In that case, the Dead Man's Statute might not apply, and the statement would be evaluated for hearsay. If it's hearsay, then it needs an exception. So if it falls under the pedigree exception, then it's admissible, making option C correct.

I'm a bit torn here. I think the key is whether the Dead Man's Statute applies to written statements or only to conversations. If it applies to any statement by the deceased when offered against the estate, then A is correct. If it only applies to conversations, then it might not apply, and the statement would be evaluated for hearsay exceptions.

Since the question doesn't specify, I'll have to go with the most likely answer. I think the Dead Man's Statute would apply here because the testator's statements are being used against his estate, so option A would make the testimony inadmissible.

But wait, I'm not entirely certain because some sources say that the Dead Man's Statute applies to prevent the opposing party from testifying about the deceased's statements. So if the claimant is offering the testator's statements, the Dead Man's Statute might not apply because it's not the estate offering them. Hmm, that complicates things.

In that case, the Dead Man's Statute might not prevent the testimony, making the hearsay the main issue. If the statement falls under a hearsay exception, like pedigree, then it's admissible. So option C or D would be correct.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to find a clearer path.

The testator's statements on the hotel register are hearsay. They are being offered to prove that the testator was married to the man's mother, which would support the man's claim of being the testator's son. Therefore, the statement is hearsay and needs an exception.

Possible exceptions: pedigree (804(b)(4)), which allows statements about family history. The testator's statement that he was Mr. and Mrs. Testator implies that he was married to the man's mother, which is about their family history. So it falls under the pedigree exception.

Therefore, the testimony is admissible under the pedigree exception, making option C correct.

But wait, could the Dead Man's Statute still bar it? If the Dead Man's Statute says that such statements can't be used against the estate, then even if it's not hearsay, it's inadmissible. But I think the Dead Man's Statute is separate from hearsay rules. So if the statement is hearsay but falls under an exception, it's admissible despite the Dead Man's Statute. Or maybe the Dead Man's Statute takes precedence.

I'm not entirely sure, but I think the primary issue here is the hearsay exception, and the Dead Man's Statute might not apply in this context, especially since it's about a written statement, not a conversation.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: admissible as a pedigree exception to the hearsay rule.

The question revolves around the admissibility of a hotel clerk's testimony regarding the testator's statements on a hotel register, where the testator signed as "Mr. and Mrs. Testator." The man claiming to be the testator's son seeks to prove his parentage, and the clerk's testimony is offered as evidence. The jurisdiction has a Dead Man's Statute in effect, which complicates the analysis.

### Key Analysis:

1. **Hearsay Issue**:  
   The clerk's testimony about the testator's statements (signing as "Mr. and Mrs. Testator") is hearsay because it is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted (i.e., that the testator and the man's mother were married). For the testimony to be admissible, it must fall under a recognized hearsay exception.

2. **Dead Man's Statute**:  
   The Dead Man's Statute generally prohibits a witness from testifying about a deceased person's statements when the deceased's estate is a party and the statement is being offered against the estate. However, the Dead Man's Statute typically applies to conversations or transactions with the deceased, not necessarily to written statements like the hotel register. Additionally, the claimant (the man) is offering the testator's statements, not the estate, which may mean the Dead Man's Statute does not apply here.

3. **Hearsay Exceptions**:  
   - **Pedigree Exception (Option C)**: This exception allows statements about family history, such as marriage or parentage, if the declarant had personal knowledge and the statement was made in a context where the declarant would have had knowledge. The testator's statements on the hotel register imply that he considered himself married to the man's mother, which is relevant to establishing the man's parentage. This exception likely applies.  
   - **Personal or Family History (Option D)**: Similar to the pedigree exception, this exception could also apply, as the testator
