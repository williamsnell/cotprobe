Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about federal civil procedure, specifically dealing with interrogatories. Hmm, let me try to work through this step by step.

The question is about a plaintiff's attorney serving the defendant with a summons, complaint, and 25 interrogatories. The interrogatories ask about the defendant's contentions and require answers within 30 days. The defendant is seeking a protective order, and I need to determine the best ground for that.

I remember that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP) govern this area. So first, I should recall the rules regarding interrogatories.

Interrogatories are a discovery tool where parties can ask each other written questions. But there are specific rules about how and when they can be used. Let me think about the key points:

1. **Timing of Service**: I think that under FRCP 26(d), parties must confer before any discovery requests can be served. This conference is to discuss the scope of discovery and arrange for initial disclosures. So, if the plaintiff served interrogatories before this conference, that might be a problem.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. I remember that initial disclosures are automatic under Rule 26(a), but parties can request a discovery plan. Also, Rule 26(f) requires a discovery planning conference, which must happen before any discovery requests except the initial ones. So, if the plaintiff served the interrogatories before this meeting, that's a ground for a protective order.

2. **Number of Interrogatories**: There's a limit on the number of interrogatories you can serve without court permission. I think the default is 25. So if the plaintiff served exactly 25, that's allowed without needing permission. But if they served more, that would be a problem. Here, it's 25, so maybe that's not the issue.

3. **Content of Interrogatories**: The questions must be relevant and not unduly burdensome. If the questions are about contentions, I think that's allowed. Wait, there's a rule against using interrogatories to ask about an opposing party's contentions or legal theories. Let me recall: Yes, under Rule 33, you can ask about facts, but not about the opponent's contentions or legal theories. So if the interrogatories are about the defendant's contentions in the case, that's improper.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. I thought that you can't use interrogatories to ask about the other side's legal contentions. So if the questions are about the defendant's contentions, that might be a valid ground for objection.

But wait, the question is about the grounds for a protective order. So possible options are: improper timing (before the discovery conference), excessive number, improper content, or being unduly burdensome.

Looking at the answer choices:

Option A: The interrogatories were not accompanied by a summons and complaint. But the question says they were served with the summons and complaint, so A is incorrect.

Option B: Defendant is not required to respond during a federal action. No, parties can be required to respond to interrogatories, so B is wrong.

Option C: Interrogatories may not be served until an answer is filed. I think that's not correct because interrogatories can be served after the answer, but I'm not sure. Wait, no, the timing is more about the conference under Rule 26(f). So C might not be correct unless the answer hasn't been filed yet. But the question doesn't specify that, so maybe C is not the best option.

Option D: Exceed number permitted. Since it's 25, which is the limit without a court order, D is not the correct answer.

Option E: Not required to respond within 30 days. Wait, under Rule 33(b), the response is due within 30 days after service, but if the defendant hasn't yet answered the complaint, they might have additional time. But I'm not sure. I think the default is 30 days, so E might not be the right ground.

Option F: Questions are excessively burdensome. That's a possible ground, but unless the facts show that, it's not clear. The question doesn't say the questions are burdensome, just that they're about contentions.

Option G: Improper service. The question says the defendant was served, so G is incorrect.

Option H: Irrelevant questions. But the question doesn't say they're irrelevant; it's about contentions, which might be a different issue.

Option I: Served before the discovery plan conference. This seems to align with my earlier thought about Rule 26(f). If the plaintiff served the interrogatories before the required conference, then the defendant can seek a protective order on this ground.

Option J: Interrogatories only for facts, not contentions. Yes, I think this is correct. Under Rule 33, you can't use interrogatories to ask about the opposing party's contentions or legal theories. So if the interrogatories are about the defendant's contentions, that's improper, and the defendant can object.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me clarify.

Rule 33 states that each interrogatory should be answered separately and fully in writing, and the content must not be overly burdensome. But more importantly, under Rule 26(a)(1)(vii), each party must provide, without a request, the legal theories and factual basis for their claims. Wait, but that's for initial disclosures, not for interrogatories.

Wait, I'm confusing initial disclosures with discovery requests. So under Rule 26(a), initial disclosures are made automatically, including the factual basis for the claims. But when it comes to interrogatories under Rule 33, the scope is broader than just facts. Wait, no, Rule 33(a)(2) says that an interrogatory otherwise proper is not necessarily objectionable merely because it asks for an opinion or contention that relates to fact or the application of law to fact.

Wait, but I think the rule is that you can ask about facts, but not about the other party's legal theories or contentions. So interrogatories that ask about the defendant's contentions would be improper.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting information. Let me try to get this straight.

The Advisory Committee Notes to Rule 33 say that interrogatories should not be used to ask for the opposing party's legal theories or contentions. So if the interrogatories here are about the defendant's contentions, that's improper, making option J a correct ground.

But I'm also considering option I, which is about serving before the discovery plan conference. So I need to figure out which of these is the better ground.

The question states that the interrogatories were served along with the summons and complaint. This would be at the very beginning of the case. The plaintiff's attorney would typically serve the complaint and summons, and then after the defendant files an answer, discovery begins, right?

But wait, the timing under Rule 26(d): "A party may not serve any other discovery requests... before the conference required by Rule 26(f)." So, the initial disclosures under Rule 26(a) are automatic, but any discovery requests (like interrogatories) can't be served until after the Rule 26(f) conference, which is the discovery planning meeting.

So, if the plaintiff served the interrogatories right after filing, without waiting for the conference, that's a violation. So option I states that interrogatories may not be served until the parties have conferred to arrange for initial disclosures and prepare a discovery plan. So that's correct.

But wait, is the initial conference required before any discovery requests? Let me confirm: Rule 26(d) says that a party may not serve any discovery requests (including interrogatories) before the Rule 26(f) conference, except for requests under Rule 26(a)(1)(vii) which relates to initial disclosures.

Wait, so the initial conference must happen before any discovery requests can be served. So if the plaintiff served the interrogatories before that conference, the defendant can move for a protective order on that basis, which is option I.

But then, if the interrogatories were also about contentions, that's another ground. So which is the better option?

The question is which ground is the defendant likely to succeed on. So, the plaintiff might have made two mistakes: serving the interrogatories too early and asking about contentions.

Looking at the options, I need to choose which is correct.

Option I says that interrogatories may not be served until the parties have conferred. That's about the timing, and if that's the case, then that's a valid ground. So the defendant can argue that the interrogatories were served prematurely.

Option J says that interrogatories are only proper to discover facts, not contentions. So if the questions are about the defendant's contentions, that's another valid ground.

So which of these is the correct answer?

Wait, perhaps both I and J are correct, but the question asks which is the ground the defendant is likely to succeed on.

But in the answer options, only one is correct.

Let me think again. The initial conference under Rule 26(f) must occur before any discovery requests are served. So if the plaintiff served the interrogatories without having that conference, that's a clear violation, making option I a correct ground. So option I is a solid reason.

As for option J, whether it's a correct ground: if the questions are about the defendant's contentions, that's improper. So both I and J could be correct, but the question only allows one answer.

Wait, but the answer options are mutually exclusive. So I need to figure out which is the more applicable ground.

In the given scenario, the plaintiff served the interrogatories at the time of serving the complaint. So unless the defendant has already responded or the case is further along, the timing is the key. Also, the number of interrogatories is 25, which is within the limit, so D is not the issue.

So, if the plaintiff served the interrogatories before the required Rule 26(f) conference, then option I applies. Therefore, the defendant can get a protective order on that ground.

Alternatively, if the interrogatories improperly ask about contentions, then option J applies.

I think the more likely ground is I because serving discovery requests before the discovery planning conference is a procedural error. But wait, in practice, do courts strictly enforce that, or is it more common to allow some leeway?

Alternatively, perhaps the plaintiff can serve the complaint and then serve interrogatories after the answer is filed, but I think the timing is governed by the Rule 26(f) conference.

Wait, the initial conference is usually after the answer is filed. Let me check the timeline. Rule 26(f) says that the conference should occur at least 21 days before the scheduling conference, which is after the answer is filed. So, the timing is such that the plaintiff can't serve discovery requests until after that conference.

Wait, no. The scheduling conference is set by the court after the answer is filed. So the plaintiff can't serve interrogatories until after the Rule 26(f) conference, which is after the defendant has answered.

Wait, but in the question, the plaintiff served the interrogatories along with the summons and complaint. That would be before the defendant has even had a chance to file an answer, right? Because the summons and complaint are the initial pleading. So the defendant hasn't answered yet, and the Rule 26(f) conference hasn't occurred yet.

Therefore, the plaintiff is jumping the gun by serving the interrogatories before the conference. So the defendant can argue that the interrogatories were served too early, making option I the correct answer.

But wait, another angle: under Rule 33(a), interrogatories may relate to any matters that can be inquired into under Rule 26(b). So if the questions are about the defendant's contentions, that's allowed? Or not?

I think the key here is that interrogatories can't be used to ask for the opposing party's legal theories or contentions, only facts. So if the interrogatories are about the defendant's contentions, that's improper, making option J correct.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting information. Let me try to look it up, but since I can't, I'll have to rely on memory.

I remember that under Rule 33(a)(2), an interrogatory is not objectionable just because it asks for an opinion or a contention. So, it's allowed. Wait, that's conflicting with what I thought earlier.

Wait, no, the rule says that an interrogatory is not necessarily objectionable because it asks for an opinion or contention that relates to fact or the application of law to fact. So, you can ask about contentions as long as they relate to facts or the application of law to facts.

So perhaps the defendant's contentions can be the subject of interrogatories, making option J not a valid ground.

Wait, but then, if the questions are about the defendant's contentions, they might be allowed, so option J wouldn't be a correct ground.

So then, the only valid ground would be that the interrogatories were served before the Rule 26(f) conference, making option I correct.

But I'm a bit confused now. Let me try to outline the possible correct answers.

Option I: served before the conference. If the conference hasn't happened, this is a valid ground.

Option J: contentions can't be asked. But according to Rule 33(a)(2), it's allowed if it relates to facts or application of law to facts. So maybe J is not correct.

So, putting it all together, the defendant can argue that the interrogatories were served before the required discovery conference, making option I the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm not entirely certain because I might be mixing up the rules about timing and content.

Alternatively, perhaps the number of interrogatories is the issue. The standard limit is 25, so 25 is allowed without a court order, so D is not correct.

So, the best option is I: served before the discovery plan conference.

The question revolves around a plaintiff's attorney serving a defendant with interrogatories in a federal district court action and determining the best ground for the defendant to seek a protective order. The interrogatories were served along with the summons and complaint, contained 25 questions about the defendant's contentions, and required answers within 30 days. The analysis focuses on the timing, content, and procedural requirements under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP).

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**: Incorrect. The interrogatories were served with the summons and complaint, so this option does not apply.

2. **Option B**: Incorrect. Parties are generally required to respond to interrogatories in a federal action, so this is not a valid ground.

3. **Option C**: Incorrect. While interrogatories are typically served after the defendant files an answer, the more critical issue here is the timing relative to the Rule 26(f) discovery planning conference, not the filing of the answer.

4. **Option D**: Incorrect. The limit on interrogatories without court permission is 25, and the plaintiff served exactly 25, so this is not a valid ground.

5. **Option E**: Incorrect. Under Rule 33(b), responses to interrogatories are due within 30 days after service, so the 30-day requirement is proper.

6. **Option F**: Incorrect. The question does not indicate that the interrogatories are excessively burdensome or expensive to answer, so this is not a valid ground.

7. **Option G**: Incorrect. The defendant was properly served with the interrogatories, so this option does not apply.

8. **Option H**: Incorrect. The question does not state that the interrogatories are irrelevant, so this is not a valid ground.

9. **Option I**: Correct. Under Rule 26(d), discovery requests, including interrogatories, cannot be served before the parties have conferred to arrange for initial disclosures and prepare a discovery plan under Rule 26(f). Since the interrogatories were served with the summons and complaint, before the required conference, this is a valid ground for a protective order.

10. **Option J**: Incorrect. While interrogatories are primarily for discovering facts, Rule 33(a)(2) allows questions about contentions if they relate to facts or the application of law to facts. Therefore, asking about the defendant's contentions is not inherently improper.

### Conclusion:
The defendant is most likely to succeed in obtaining a protective order on the ground that the interrogatories were served before the required Rule 26(f) discovery planning conference. This makes **Option I** the correct answer.
