Okay, so I have this question about disposable income. Hmm, I remember that disposable income is some kind of income after certain deductions, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think this through.

The question is asking what disposable income is, and it's repeated twice, so I guess it's emphasizing. The options are from A to J. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A says it's the total income before taxes are paid. Wait, isn't that just gross income? Yeah, I think gross income is before taxes. So A might not be correct.

Option B is total income after business expenses have been deducted. That sounds more like net profit for a business, not personal disposable income. So probably not B.

Option C states it's the amount of personal income remaining after taxes have been paid. Oh, that rings a bell. Disposable income is what's left after paying taxes. So C could be the right answer.

Option D is income after mandatory health insurance payments. Health insurance is a deduction, but I don't think that's the defining factor. Disposable income is broader, including all taxes, not just health insurance.

Option E is income used exclusively for investment. No, disposable income is what's available to spend or save, not specifically for investments.

Option F is for luxury goods. No, disposable income can be used for anything, not just luxuries.

Option G is government revenue, which is the opposite. That's what the government collects, not what's left for the individual.

Option H is income for savings only. Again, disposable income can be spent, saved, or invested, not just savings.

Option I is income after paying for basic necessities. Wait, isn't that more like discretionary income? Because after basics, what's left is for discretionary spending. So I might be mixing up terms here.

Option J is after paying utilities. Utilities are part of basic necessities, so similar to I. But I think the correct term is that disposable income comes after taxes, and then you can spend it on anything, including utilities, basics, etc.

So putting it all together, the definition in C seems to fit: personal income after taxes. That makes sense because disposable income is the money you have available to spend after paying taxes, which are mandatory.

I think I've heard that gross income minus taxes equals disposable income. So yes, C is correct.

Disposable income refers to the amount of personal income that remains after taxes have been deducted. It is the money available for spending, saving, or investing after paying mandatory taxes. 

The correct answer is C.

C
