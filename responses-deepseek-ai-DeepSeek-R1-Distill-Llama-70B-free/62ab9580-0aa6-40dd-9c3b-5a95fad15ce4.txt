Question:

Which of the following best states why the study of twins is significant to the field of behavioral genetics?

Options:

A: If a psychological attribute is genetically influenced, then fraternal twins are more likely to share this attribute than are identical twins or other siblings.
B: The degree of relatedness in MZ twins can be determined through studying the behavioral genetics of related DZ twins.
C: The degree of relatedness in DZ twins can be determined through studying the behavioral genetics of unrelated MZ twins.
D: If a psychological attribute is genetically influenced, then non-twin siblings are more likely to share this attribute than are identical or fraternal twins.
E: If a psychological attribute is not genetically influenced, then identical twins are less likely to share this attribute than are fraternal twins and other siblings.
F: If a psychological attribute is genetically influenced, then fraternal twins reared apart are more likely to share this attribute than are identical twins reared together.
G: If a psychological attribute is genetically influenced, then identical twins reared apart are less likely to share this attribute than are fraternal twins reared together.
H: If a psychological attribute is genetically influenced, then identical twins are more likely to share this attribute than are fraternal twins and other siblings.
I: If a psychological attribute is genetically influenced, then siblings reared together are more likely to share it than are identical or fraternal twins who are reared apart.
J: If a psychological attribute is not genetically influenced, then fraternal twins are more likely to share this attribute than are identical twins or other siblings.

Okay, so I've got this question about behavioral genetics and twin studies. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking why the study of twins is significant in this field. The options are A to J, each making a different claim.

I remember that twin studies are used to determine the influence of genetics versus environment on traits. So, the main idea is to compare identical twins (monozygotic, MZ) and fraternal twins (dizygotic, DZ). Identical twins share almost all their genes, while fraternal twins share about half, like any siblings.

The core concept here is heritability. If a trait has a genetic component, then identical twins should show more similarity than fraternal twins. Because MZ twins are genetically more similar, any trait influenced by genes should be more shared between them compared to DZ twins. So the study looks at whether MZ twins are more alike than DZ twins for a particular trait. If they are, it suggests genetics play a role.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Says fraternal twins are more likely to share an attribute influenced by genetics than identical twins. That doesn't make sense. If genetics are involved, identical twins should share more, not less. So A is probably wrong.

Option B: Talks about determining relatedness through MZ and DZ. I'm not sure. I think relatedness is already knownâ€”MZ are more related. This option seems off because the study isn't about determining relatedness but rather using it to infer genetic influence.

Option C: Similar issue. It's about using MZ to find DZ relatedness. Doesn't fit the main point of twin studies.

Option D: Non-twin siblings sharing more than twins if genetic. No, MZ twins should share more than others if it's genetic. So D is incorrect.

Option E: If a trait isn't genetic, identical twins share less than fraternal and others. Wait, if it's not genetic, then environment plays a role. Identical twins reared together share the same environment, so they might be more similar. But the option says they share less, which doesn't sound right. If there's no genetic influence, then shared environment would make MZ more similar than DZ, but the option says they are less likely. So E might not be correct.

Option F: Fraternal twins reared apart share more than identical twins reared together if genetic. That doesn't make sense. If it's genetic, identical together should share more than fraternal apart. So F is wrong.

Option G: Identical twins reared apart are less likely to share than fraternal together. If the trait is genetic, identical apart should still be more similar than fraternal together because they share more genes. So G seems incorrect.

Option H: Identical twins more likely to share than fraternal and others if genetic. Yes, this aligns with what I was thinking earlier. If a trait is genetically influenced, MZ twins (sharing more genes) should show higher similarity than DZ or regular siblings. So H sounds correct.

Option I: Siblings reared together share more than twins apart if genetic. No, because if it's genetic, twins (especially MZ) should share more regardless of rearing. So I's incorrect.

Option J: If not genetic, fraternal twins share more than identical. No, if not genetic, environment matters. Identical twins reared together share environment more, so they would be more similar. So J is wrong.

So the correct answer should be H. It correctly states that if a trait is genetically influenced, identical twins are more likely to share it than fraternal twins or other siblings.

The study of twins is significant in behavioral genetics because it helps determine the influence of genetics versus environment on traits. Identical twins (monozygotic, MZ) share nearly all their genes, while fraternal twins (dizygotic, DZ) share about half, similar to other siblings. If a trait is genetically influenced, MZ twins should show more similarity than DZ twins due to their greater genetic relatedness. This comparison allows researchers to infer the genetic contribution to a trait.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. If a trait is genetically influenced, identical twins should share it more, not less, than fraternal twins.
- **B**: Incorrect. The study is not about determining relatedness but using it to assess genetic influence.
- **C**: Incorrect. Relatedness is already known; the focus is on comparing genetic influence.
- **D**: Incorrect. MZ twins should share more than non-twin siblings if the trait is genetic.
- **E**: Incorrect. If a trait is not genetic, shared environment would make MZ twins more similar, not less.
- **F**: Incorrect. If a trait is genetic, identical twins reared together should share it more than fraternal twins reared apart.
- **G**: Incorrect. Identical twins reared apart should still share more than fraternal twins reared together if the trait is genetic.
- **H**: Correct. If a trait is genetically influenced, identical twins are more likely to share it than fraternal twins or other siblings due to their greater genetic similarity.
- **I**: Incorrect. If a trait is genetic, twins (especially MZ) should share more regardless of rearing environment.
- **J**: Incorrect. If a trait is not genetic, identical twins reared together would likely share it more due to shared environment.

The correct answer is **H**, as it accurately reflects the role of twin studies in assessing genetic influence.
