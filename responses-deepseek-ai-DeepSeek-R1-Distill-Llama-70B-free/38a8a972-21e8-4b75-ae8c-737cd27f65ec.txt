Okay, so I've got this problem about Ted Logan's medical expenses and Medicare coverage. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

First, I need to figure out Ted's total medical expenses. Then, determine how much Medicare will pay and how much Ted has to pay himself. The options are from A to J, so I'll need to calculate each part and match it to the correct option.

Alright, let's start by listing all of Ted's expenses. From the problem:

1. He spent 72 days in the hospital at $52 a day.
2. 30 days in a convalescent home at $13 a day.
3. Visiting nurse 3 times a week for 10 weeks at $12 per call.
4. Doctor's bills totaling $1335.

I should calculate each of these separately and then sum them up for the total expenses.

Starting with the hospital stay. 72 days at $52 per day. So that's 72 * 52. Let me compute that. 70 days would be 70*52=3640, and 2 days would be 104, so total 3744 dollars. Wait, wait. 52 * 72: 52*70 is 3640, 52*2 is 104, so 3744. Okay.

Next, the convalescent home: 30 days at $13 each. 30 *13 is 390.

Then, the visiting nurse: 3 times a week for 10 weeks. So that's 3*10=30 visits. Each visit is $12, so 30 *12=360.

Doctor's bills are a flat $1335.

Adding all these together: 3744 (hospital) + 390 (convalescent) = 4134. Plus 360 (visiting nurse) is 4494. Plus 1335 (doctors) gives 4494 +1335 = 5829? Wait, wait, let me check the addition again.

Wait, 3744 + 390 is 4134. Then +360 is 4494. Then 4494 +1335: 4494 +1000 is 5494, +335 is 5829. Hmm, but looking at the options, none have $5829 as the total. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me recheck.

Wait, the hospital was 72 days at $52/day: 72 *52. Let me calculate that correctly. 52 times 70 is 3640, 52 times 2 is 104, so 3640+104=3744. That seems right.

Convalescent home: 30 days *13 = 390. Correct.

Visiting nurse: 3 times/week *10 weeks =30 visits. At $12 each, 30*12=360. Correct.

Doctors: $1335.

So total is 3744 + 390 = 4134; 4134 +360 =4494; 4494 +1335 =5829.

But looking at the options, the totals are like $5985, $6500, etc. So maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check the problem statement.

Wait, the problem states that Ted had 72 days in the hospital. But let me check the costs again. Oh wait, wait, perhaps the problem says something different. Let me reread.

Ah, the problem says: Ted spent 72 days in the hospital at $52 a day. Correct. 30 days in convalescent home at $13 a day. Correct. Visiting nurse: three times a week for ten weeks at $12 per call. So 3*10=30 calls, 30*12=360.

So the total is 72*52=3744, 30*13=390, 30*12=360, and 1335. Wait, 3744 +390 is 4134. +360 is 4494. +1335 is 5829. But none of the options have 5829. Hmm. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I misread the visiting nurse part. Let me check: "three times a week for ten weeks at $12 a call." So 3 calls per week for 10 weeks is 30 calls. 30*12=360. That seems right.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the hospital days are 72, but maybe the daily rate is $52. So 72 *52 is 3744. Correct.

Hmm, but the options don't include 5829. So perhaps I messed up the math. Let me add again.

3744 (hospital) + 390 (convalescent) = 4134.

4134 + 360 (visiting nurse) = 4494.

4494 +1335 (doctors) = 4494 +1335.

Let me compute 4494 +1000 =5494, then +335 gives 5829.

Hmm, but looking at the options, I don't see that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem understanding.

Wait, perhaps the first part of the problem is about Ted's expenses, but the options don't have 5829. Wait, let me check the options again.

Looking at option E: total expenses $5985, which is higher than my calculation. So perhaps I made an error in the addition.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated. Let me try adding the components again.

Hospital: 72 days *52 = 3744.

Convalescent: 30 *13 =390, correct.

Visiting nurse: 30*12=360, correct.

Doctors:1335.

Now adding: 3744 +390 =4134.

4134 +360=4494.

4494 +1335=5829.

Wait, but perhaps the problem requires adding all these as total medical expenses, but the options don't have 5829. So maybe I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps I should check the Medicare coverage first, but the question first asks for total medical expenses, then Medicare's payment, then Ted's share.

Wait, perhaps I'm correct in the total, but let's proceed to calculate what Medicare pays. Maybe that will help clarify.

So, according to the Medicare coverage schedule:

1. Hospitalization: 
- $0 for first $72 of expense. Wait, no, wait: the coverage is $0 for the first $72 of expense, then up to $75 per day for up to 60 days thereafter, and up to $34 per day thereafter.

Wait, wait: Let me parse that correctly. The first part says that for hospitalization, the coverage is $0 for the first $72 of expense. So the first $72 is Ted's responsibility, and Medicare covers the rest according to the per-day rates.

Wait, no, wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me read again.

"Coverage: $0 for first $72 of expense, Up to $75 per day for up to 60 days thereafter, and up to $34 per day thereafter."

Wait, perhaps it's the first 72 dollars, meaning that Medicare pays nothing for the first $72 of the hospital bill, and then covers up to $75 per day for the next 60 days, and then up to $34 per day after that.

So, for the hospital stay, Ted spent 72 days at $52 per day, so total hospital bill is 72 *52 = $3744.

Now, the first $72 is Ted's responsibility because Medicare covers $0 for the first $72. So Ted pays the first $72.

Then, for the remaining days beyond the first $72, which is 72 days minus the days covered by the first $72. Wait, perhaps another approach: Let's compute the total hospital bill, subtract $72, and then see how much is covered by Medicare.

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to think in terms of per-day coverage after the first $72.

Wait, perhaps the $72 is a deductible, meaning that the first $72 is paid by Ted, and then Medicare starts paying.

So, for the hospitalization, Ted's total is $3744. The first $72 is Ted's, so the remaining is $3744 -72 = $3672.

Now, Medicare will cover up to $75 per day for up to 60 days, and up to $34 per day beyond that.

So, Ted was in the hospital for 72 days. After the first $72, the remaining 72 days are covered as follows:

Wait, no, the first $72 is a flat amount, not per day. So the first $72 comes off the total, and the rest is covered per day for up to 60 days at $75, then beyond that at $34.

So, the total hospital bill is $3744.

Ted's responsibility starts with the first $72, so Medicare covers the rest, but with per-day limits.

So, after the first $72, the remaining is $3744 -72 = $3672.

Now, for the first 60 days, Medicare pays up to $75 per day. But Ted's hospital stay is 72 days, so the first 60 days would be covered at $75 each, and the remaining 12 days at $34 each.

Wait, but wait: the $75 per day is up to 60 days after the deductible. So, let's compute the Medicare payment for the hospital.

Medicare hospital payment: (60 days * $75) + (12 days * $34) = 60*75=4500 + 12*34=408. So total Medicare payment is 4500+408=4908.

But wait, the total after deductible is $3672. So Medicare would pay the lesser of their per-day coverage or the actual amount.

Wait, no, the per-day coverage is the maximum they'll pay per day, so if the hospital charges more than that, Medicare only pays up to their limit.

Wait, but in this case, the hospital charges $52 per day, which is less than both $75 and $34. So for each day beyond the deductible, Medicare would cover the full $52, but wait no, because their coverage is up to $75 for the first 60 days, and up to $34 for days beyond that.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing this. Let me think again.

The hospital charges Ted $52 per day. So for each day, Medicare's payment is the minimum of their coverage per day and the actual charge.

So, for days 1-60 after deductible, Medicare covers up to $75, but the hospital only charges $52, so Medicare pays $52 per day for the first 60 days beyond the deductible.

Wait, but no, the deductible is a flat $72, not per-day. So the first $72 of the hospital bill is Ted's responsibility, and then for the rest, Medicare pays up to $75 per day for the next 60 days, and up to $34 per day beyond that.

Wait, perhaps it's better to break it down:

Total hospital bill: 72 days *52 = 3744.

Ted pays the first $72. So the remaining is 3744-72=3672.

Now, for the next 60 days, Medicare pays up to $75 per day. But since the hospital charges only $52 per day, Medicare would pay $52 per day for those 60 days. Wait, no, because the coverage is up to $75. So if the hospital charges $52, which is less than $75, Medicare would pay the full $52 for each of those days.

So, for days 1-60 after the deductible (but wait, the deductible is a flat $72, so the 72 days include the deductible?), perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me approach it differently.

Wait, perhaps the 72 days include all days, and the first $72 is the deductible, so the rest is covered as per the per-day rates.

So, the first $72 is Ted's. Then, for the next 60 days, Medicare covers up to $75 per day, but the hospital charges $52, so per day, Medicare pays $52. For days 61-72 (12 days), Medicare covers up to $34 per day, which is less than the $52 charged. So in that case, Medicare would pay $34 per day, and Ted would have to pay the difference? Or does the hospital bill get reduced?

Wait, no, I think the way it works is that Medicare pays up to their per-day rate, so the hospital can't charge more than that. But in this case, the hospital's rate is $52, which is less than $75, so for days 1-60 beyond the deductible, they pay $52 per day. For days 61-72 (12 days), the hospital charges $52, but Medicare only covers up to $34, so the Medicare payment would be $34 per day, and Ted would be responsible for the remaining $18 per day for those 12 days.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the hospital's charges beyond the deductible are limited by Medicare's per-day payments.

So let's compute the Medicare hospital payment.

Total after deductible: 72 days *52 =3744.

Deductible is $72, so the rest is 3744-72=3672.

Now, for the first 60 days (after the deductible?), no, the 60 days are part of the 72. So perhaps the deductible applies to the total bill, not per-day.

So, after paying the first $72, the remaining $3672 is subject to per-day coverage.

The per-day coverage is $75 for up to 60 days, and $34 beyond that.

Wait, but the 60 days are within the 72 days. So the first 60 days after the deductible? Or after the first day?

This is getting confusing. Maybe it's better to structure it as:

- Day 1: Ted pays $72 (the deductible). But wait, the deductible is a flat $72, so perhaps the first $72 of the total bill is Ted's responsibility, not per day.

Ah, that makes more sense. So regardless of the days, the first $72 of the total hospital bill is Ted's, and the rest is covered by Medicare according to their per-day rates, but not exceeding their limits.

So, total hospital bill is $3744.

Ted pays the first $72, so the remaining is 3744-72=3672.

Now, for this $3672, Medicare will pay according to their per-day rates, but only up to their limits.

So, the 72 days of hospital stay:

- Days 1-60: Medicare covers up to $75 per day. Since the hospital charges $52, which is less than $75, Medicare pays $52 per day for these days.

- Days 61-72 (12 days): Medicare covers up to $34 per day, but the hospital charges $52. So Medicare would pay $34 per day, and Ted would have to pay the remaining $52-$34=$18 per day for these 12 days.

Wait, but that would mean that Ted's total cost is the initial $72 plus the $18*12 for the last 12 days.

But wait, no, because the $3672 is the amount after the deductible. So Medicare would pay the per-day coverage up to their limits, and any excess would have to be paid by Ted, but only if the hospital charges more than Medicare's rate.

So, for days 1-60: 60 days *52 =3120. Medicare would pay this because it's under their $75 limit.

For days 61-72: 12 days *52=624. But Medicare only covers up to $34 per day, so 12*34=408. So Medicare pays 408, and Ted would pay the remaining 624-408=216.

So total Medicare payment for hospital is 3120+408=3528.

Ted's payment is 72 (deductible) +216=288.

Wait, but let me check the numbers again. Total hospital bill is 3744.

Ted pays 72.

Medicare pays 60*52=3120 (since 52<75, so they pay full) and 12*34=408. So total Medicare: 3120+408=3528.

So 72 +3528=3600, which is less than 3744. So the difference is 3744-3600=144. Hmm, that suggests that Ted would have to pay an additional 144, which doesn't add up because according to the per-day, we've accounted for 60 days at 52 and 12 at 34.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the math. Let me compute again.

Total after deductible: 3744-72=3672.

Medicare pays for the first 60 days at 52 each: 60*52=3120.

Then, the remaining 12 days: 12*34=408.

So total Medicare payment:3120+408=3528.

So the total covered is 3528, which is less than 3672.

Thus, Ted would have to pay the remaining 3672-3528=144.

So Ted's total for hospital is 72 (deductible) +144=216.

So total hospital cost to Ted is 216.

Wait, but earlier I thought Ted's payment for hospital is 72 + (12 days * (52-34)=18 each)=72+216=288. Now I'm getting 72+144=216. Hmm, which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I should think of it as the total amount Medicare pays is 3528. So the total hospital bill is 3744. Ted pays 3744 -3528=216, but that's after the deductible.

Wait, no. Wait, the deductible is the first 72, so Ted pays 72, and then Medicare pays the rest up to their limits. But if the rest is 3672, and Medicare pays 3528, then Ted pays 72 + (3672-3528)=72+144=216.

Yes, that's correct.

So Ted's hospital cost is 216.

Now, moving on to the convalescent home. 30 days at $13 per day, so 30*13=390.

Medicare's coverage for convalescent home: up to $15 per day for days 1-20, and up to $4.50 per day thereafter.

So, for the first 20 days, Medicare pays up to $15 per day. Since the home charges $13, which is less than $15, Medicare pays $13 per day for 20 days.

For days 21-30 (10 days), Medicare pays up to $4.50 per day. The home charges $13, so Medicare would pay $4.50 each day, and Ted would have to pay the remaining $8.50 per day.

So, Medicare payment for convalescent home:

20 days *13=260.

10 days *4.50=45.

Total Medicare payment:260+45=305.

Ted's payment: (20 days *0, because 13<15) + (10 days*(13-4.50)=8.5 each) →10
