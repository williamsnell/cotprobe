Question:

Find 13 over 14 + 7 over 14.

Options:

A: 20 over 28
B: 2 and 3 over 14
C: 1 and 3 over 7
D: 2 and 1 over 14
E: 3 and 2 over 7

G: 1 and 1 over 7
H: 1 and 1 over 2
I: 1 and 5 over 14
J: 1 and 4 over 7

Answer:

To solve \( \frac{13}{14} + \frac{7}{14} \), first note that both fractions have the same denominator, which simplifies the addition.

1. **Add the numerators**:  
   \( 13 + 7 = 20 \).

2. **Keep the denominator the same**:  
   The denominator remains 14.

   So, \( \frac{13}{14} + \frac{7}{14} = \frac{20}{14} \).

3. **Simplify the fraction**:  
   Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2.  
   \( \frac{20 \div 2}{14 \div 2} = \frac{10}{7} \).

4. **Convert to a mixed number**:  
   \( \frac{10}{7} = 1 \frac{3}{7} \).

Now, compare this result to the answer choices:

- **Option C**: \( 1 \frac{3}{7} \) matches the calculated result.

Thus, the correct answer is:

C: 1 and 3 over 7.

Answer: C
