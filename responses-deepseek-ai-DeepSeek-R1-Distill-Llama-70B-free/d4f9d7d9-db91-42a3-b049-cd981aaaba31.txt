Okay, so I have this question about PKU and mental retardation prevention. Hmm, I remember PKU stands for Phenylketonuria. It's a genetic disorder, right? So, I think it affects how the body processes phenylalanine, which is an amino acid. If someone has PKU, their body can't break down phenylalanine properly, and it builds up, causing problems.

The question is about preventing the mental retardation associated with PKU. The options are A through I. Let me think about each option.

Option A: Hormone replacement therapy. I don't recall hormones being the main issue in PKU. It's more about metabolism, so probably not A.

Option B: Surgical intervention. I'm not sure about surgery for PKU. Maybe some procedures, but I don't think that's the main treatment. It's usually managed through diet.

Option C: Psychotherapy. That's more for mental health issues, not the cause here. PKU's problems are physical, so C doesn't seem right.

Option D: Vitamin supplements. Vitamins are important, but PKU is specifically about phenylalanine. I think the main treatment is dietary restriction, but maybe supplements are part of it. I'm not certain if that's the key here.

Option E: Blood transfusions. That doesn't make sense. Blood transfusions are for blood loss or disorders like anemia, not metabolic issues like PKU.

Option F: Removal of environmental toxins. I don't think environmental toxins cause PKU. It's a genetic condition, so F is probably not correct.

Option G: Gene therapy. That's a possibility since PKU is genetic. Gene therapy aims to fix the defective gene. But I'm not sure if it's the current standard treatment or if it's even available yet for PKU.

Option H: Antibiotics. Those are for infections. PKU isn't caused by bacteria, so H is out.

Option I: Regular exercise. Exercise is good for overall health, but it doesn't treat the metabolic issue in PKU. So I don't think it's I.

Wait, the main treatment for PKU I remember is a strict diet low in phenylalanine. But the options don't mention diet. Oh, but looking at the options, D is vitamin supplements. Maybe that's part of the dietary management? Or perhaps the question is referring to something else.

Alternatively, another approach is that untreated PKU leads to high phenylalanine levels, which are toxic to the brain. So preventing this buildup is key. Early diagnosis through newborn screening allows for early intervention, which is dietary restriction. But the options don't have that.

Wait, another thought. There's a substance called tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) which is a cofactor for the enzyme that breaks down phenylalanine. Some people with PKU respond to BH4 supplements, which helps reduce phenylalanine levels. So maybe that's a supplement, which would fall under D: vitamin supplements. But BH4 isn't exactly a vitamin; it's more of a cofactor. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, gene therapy is a possible future treatment, but as of now, it's still experimental. So maybe the question is considering that as an option. But I'm not certain.

Wait, the question says the mental retardation is preventable with which option. So the standard treatment is a low-Phe diet starting early. But since diet isn't an option, perhaps the next best is D: vitamin supplements. Or maybe G: gene therapy, but I think gene therapy isn't the current standard for prevention.

Wait another angle: PKU is caused by a defect in the PAH gene, which leads to inability to metabolize phenylalanine. The standard treatment is dietary restriction. So none of the options directly say that, but D is about supplements. Or perhaps the answer is G: gene therapy, as a future possibility. But I'm not sure if that's what the question is pointing towards.

Wait, another thought. In some cases, supplements like BH4 can help, but it's not a vitamin. So maybe D is incorrect. Alternatively, the question might be referring to newborn screening and early dietary intervention, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is G: gene therapy. But I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe the question is outdated. I'll have to think about what I learned. The primary prevention is dietary control, but perhaps if you can't do that, other options like gene therapy could prevent it. But since gene therapy isn't widely available yet, the answer might be D, but I'm not certain.

Wait, looking back, PKU is managed by a strict diet, but the question is about what's preventable. So the cause is the buildup of phenylalanine. So the main approach is avoiding it in the diet. But since diet isn't an option, perhaps the answer is D: vitamin supplements. Or maybe it's G, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I've heard that some forms of PKU can be managed with supplements. For example, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) is used for some patients. So if that's considered a vitamin supplement, then D would be correct. But BH4 is more of a cofactor than a vitamin. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the answer is D because it refers to dietary adjustments that include supplements, not just vitamins. Or maybe the question is more about the fact that without treatment, the condition leads to retardation, and the treatment is diet. But the options don't have diet, so I'm a bit stuck.

Alternatively, I think the intended answer is G: gene therapy, as a way to correct the genetic defect. But I'm not sure if that's the current standard of care. I recall that gene therapy is being researched but isn't widely used yet.

Wait, the question is about "preventable with:", so it's looking for the method. The standard method is diet, but since that's not an option, perhaps the answer is G. Alternatively, the question might think that without treatment, it's a problem, and treatment is diet, but since that's not an option, maybe the answer is D.

I'm a bit torn, but perhaps the answer is G: gene therapy. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating, and the answer is D because it's about managing the condition with supplements.

Wait, another angle: the question is from a textbook, perhaps. I remember that PKU is a classic example where early diagnosis and dietary intervention can prevent mental retardation. But since the options don't include diet, perhaps the intended answer is D, as in dietary supplements.

Alternatively, the answer might be G, considering gene therapy as a possible future option. But I'm not sure. I think the correct answer is D: vitamin supplements.

Wait, no, I think I'm mixing things up. Vitamin supplements wouldn't address the phenylalanine issue. The key is managing the amino acid levels. So maybe the answer is G: gene therapy. Because gene therapy would address the root cause, the defective gene, thus preventing the condition.

But since gene therapy isn't the current standard treatment, I'm a bit confused. The standard is diet, but that's not an option. So perhaps the intended answer is G.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: PKU is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. If the enzyme is deficient, phenylalanine can't be converted into tyrosine, leading to buildup. So the treatment is a low-protein diet to reduce Phe intake. But again, that's not an option.

So considering the options given, the best fit would be G: gene therapy, as it targets the genetic cause. But I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D because it's about managing the condition with supplements that help lower phenylalanine levels. For example, some patients use BH4 supplements, which help the body process Phe better. But since BH4 isn't a vitamin, I'm not sure if D is correct.

Wait, the options don't specify BH4, so perhaps the answer is D: vitamin supplements. Or perhaps the question is expecting G as the answer, considering it's a genetic disorder and gene therapy is a possible prevention.

I think I'm going to go with G: gene therapy, but I'm not 100% confident.

The question asks about the prevention of mental retardation associated with Phenylketonuria (PKU), a genetic disorder caused by a defect in the PAH gene, leading to an inability to metabolize phenylalanine (Phe). If untreated, Phe builds up, causing neurological damage. The standard treatment is a strict low-Phe diet, but this option is not listed. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Hormone replacement therapy** is irrelevant, as PKU is not related to hormones.  
- **B: Surgical intervention** is not a standard treatment for PKU.  
- **C: Psychotherapy** addresses mental health issues, not the metabolic cause of PKU.  
- **D: Vitamin supplements** could refer to cofactors like tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), which helps some patients metabolize Phe, but BH4 is not technically a vitamin.  
- **E: Blood transfusions** are unrelated to PKU.  
- **F: Removal of environmental toxins** is incorrect, as PKU is genetic.  
- **G: Gene therapy** targets the defective PAH gene and could theoretically prevent PKU, though it is still experimental.  
- **H: Antibiotics** are for infections, not metabolic disorders.  
- **I: Regular exercise** improves general health but does not address the metabolic defect in PKU.  

The best answer depends on interpreting the question. If focusing on current treatments, dietary management (not listed) is standard, but if considering future possibilities, **G: gene therapy** is a plausible option. Since diet is not an option, **G** aligns with the idea of preventing the condition by addressing its genetic root cause.  

Answer: G
