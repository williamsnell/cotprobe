Okay, so I've got this question here about finding the mass of 1 liter of carbon monoxide (CO) at STP. Hmm, I remember that STP stands for Standard Temperature and Pressure, which is 0 degrees Celsius and 1 atmosphere pressure. But wait, I think at STP, one mole of an ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters. So that's the molar volume I should use here.

Wait, but wait, is that right? I think I might be mixing up STP and standard conditions. Oh right, STP is indeed 22.4 L per mole for ideal gases. So if I have 1 liter of CO at STP, that should be 1/22.4 moles of CO. But wait, CO is a diatomic molecule, right? So it's made of carbon and oxygen. Let me think about the molar mass.

The atomic weight of carbon is about 12.01 g/mol, and oxygen is 16.00 g/mol. So CO would be 12.01 + 16.00 = 28.01 g/mol. So each mole of CO weighs 28.01 grams.

Now, if 22.4 liters is 1 mole, then 1 liter is 1/22.4 moles. So the number of moles in 1 liter is approximately 0.0446 moles (since 1/22.4 is about 0.0446). Then the mass would be moles multiplied by molar mass, so 0.0446 * 28.01 g.

Let me calculate that. 0.0446 times 28 is roughly 1.249 grams. Let me check the exact math. 0.0446 * 28.01: 0.04 * 28 is 1.12, 0.0046*28 is about 0.1288, so adding them gives around 1.2488 grams. So approximately 1.25 grams.

Wait, but let me make sure about the molar volume. Another thought: sometimes STP is defined at 273.15 K and 1 bar. Wait, 1 bar is a bit different from 1 atm. Oh right, 1 atm is about 101325 Pa, and 1 bar is 100000 Pa. So the molar volume might be slightly different. But wait, for STP, as per common definitions, it's 22.4 L/mol at 0°C and 1 atm. So I think I should stick with 22.4 L/mol.

Wait, wait, another point: some sources say that at STP (1 atm, 0°C), the molar volume is 22.414 L/mol. So a more precise value might be 22.414. Let me recalculate using that. 1 / 22.414 is approximately 0.04462 moles. So 0.04462 * 28.01 g/mol.

Calculating 0.04462 * 28.01. Let's compute 0.04 *28.01 =1.1204, 0.00462 *28.01=approx 0.1293. Adding them gives about 1.2497 grams. So roughly 1.25 grams.

Looking back at the options: Option J is 1.25 g. So that must be the correct answer. But wait, let me check the options again.

The options are A:1.67, B:1.80, C:1.14, D:2.20, E:0.92, F:1.5, G:1.0, H:0.86, I:2.0, J:1.25. So yes, J is 1.25 g.

Wait, but wait another thought: sometimes, in STP, some sources use 22.7 L/mol. But I think that's more for rough calculations. The exact value is 22.414 L/mol. So with 22.414, the calculation is accurate.

Alternatively, let me think about the ideal gas law. PV = nRT. At STP, P is 1 atm, V is 1 L, T is 273.15 K. R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K.

So n = PV/(RT) = (1 atm * 1 L) / (0.0821 * 273.15) ≈ 1 / (22.414) ≈ 0.04462 mol.

So moles of CO is 0.04462. Molar mass of CO is 28.01 g/mol. So mass is 0.04462 * 28.01 ≈ 1.25 g. Yep, so J is correct.

I think I'm confident now. The answer should be J:1.25 g.

To determine the mass of 1 liter of carbon monoxide (CO) at standard temperature and pressure (STP), we start by noting that at STP (0°C and 1 atm), 1 mole of an ideal gas occupies 22.4 liters. Therefore, 1 liter of CO at STP corresponds to \( \frac{1}{22.4} \approx 0.04464 \) moles of CO.

The molar mass of CO is calculated as the sum of the atomic masses of carbon (\( 12.01 \, \text{g/mol} \)) and oxygen (\( 16.00 \, \text{g/mol} \)), giving \( 12.01 + 16.00 = 28.01 \, \text{g/mol} \).

The mass of 1 liter of CO is then the product of the number of moles and the molar mass:

\[
\text{Mass} = 0.04464 \, \text{mol} \times 28.01 \, \text{g/mol} \approx 1.25 \, \text{g}.
\]

Thus, the mass of 1 liter of CO at STP is approximately \( 1.25 \, \text{g} \).

From the given options:

- **A: 1.67 g**
- **B: 1.80 g**
- **C: 1.14 g**
- **D: 2.20 g**
- **E: 0.92 g**
- **F: 1.5 g**
- **G: 1.0 g**
- **H: 0.86 g**
- **I: 2.0 g**
- **J: 1.25 g**

The correct answer is **J: 1.25 g**.
