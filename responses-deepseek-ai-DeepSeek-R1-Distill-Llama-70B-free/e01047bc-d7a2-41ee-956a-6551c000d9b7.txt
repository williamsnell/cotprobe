Okay, so I have this math problem here: I need to find the number that makes the equation 2/9 equal to 14 over something. The options are A through J, and I have to choose the right one. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.

Wait, the equation is 2/9 = 14/? So I guess I need to solve for the question mark. Maybe cross-multiplication would work here. Yeah, that sounds right because when you have two fractions equal to each other, cross-multiplying helps find the missing number.

So, if I set up the equation like this: 2/9 = 14/x, where x is the unknown. To solve for x, I can cross-multiply. That means 2 times x should equal 9 times 14. Let me write that down: 2x = 9*14.

Wait, what's 9 times 14? Let me calculate that. 9*10 is 90, and 9*4 is 36, so adding them gives 126. So 2x = 126. Now, I need to solve for x by dividing both sides by 2. So x = 126 / 2. That's 63. Oh, so the missing number should be 63.

Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. If I plug x=63 into 14/x, that would be 14/63. Simplifying that, both numerator and denominator are divisible by 7. 14 divided by 7 is 2, and 63 divided by 7 is 9. So 14/63 reduces to 2/9, which matches the left side of the equation. Yep, that makes sense.

Looking back at the options, option G is 63. So the correct answer must be G.

The equation given is 2/9 = 14/? To find the missing number, we can use cross-multiplication. Setting up the equation as 2/9 = 14/x, cross-multiplying gives 2x = 9*14, which simplifies to 2x = 126. Dividing both sides by 2 yields x = 63. Verifying, 14/63 simplifies to 2/9, confirming the solution is correct. Among the options, 63 corresponds to option G.

Answer: G
