Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked. 

The problem says that Fred Lowes is a typewriter salesman and he gets $15 for each typewriter he sells. The question is asking, if he sells 12 typewriters, what's his commission? The options are from A to J, each with different dollar amounts.

Alright, so I think commission here means the total amount he earns from selling those typewriters. So, each typewriter gives him $15. If he sells 12, I guess I just need to multiply 15 by 12.

Let me do the multiplication. 15 times 12. Hmm, I remember that 15 times 10 is 150, and 15 times 2 is 30. So adding those together, 150 plus 30 equals 180. So, 15 * 12 = 180. That would make his commission $180.

Wait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Another way to multiply 15 by 12 is to break it down into smaller parts. 12 can be 10 plus 2. So, 15 * 10 is 150, and 15 * 2 is 30. Adding them gives 180. Yep, that checks out. Or I could do it the standard way: 15 multiplied by 12. 5 times 2 is 10, carry over the 1. 5 times 1 is 5 plus the carried 1 makes 6. Then, 1 times 2 is 2, and 1 times 1 is 1. So putting it together, it's 180. Wait, no, that might not be the right way. Maybe I should write it out:

   15
x 12
------
   30  (which is 15 x 2)
150   (which is 15 x 10, shifted one position to the left)
------
180

Yes, that's correct. So 15 times 12 is definitely 180.

Now, looking at the options provided:

A: $210
B: $200
C: $225
D: $175
E: $195
F: $150
G: $255
H: $240
I: $180
J: $165

I see that option I is $180, which matches my calculation. So the correct answer should be I.

I don't think I made any mistakes here, but just to be thorough, let me consider if there's any other possible interpretation of the question. For example, does commission sometimes have different calculations, like a percentage of sales or something else? But the problem states he receives $15 for each typewriter sold, which sounds like a flat rate per unit. So it's a straightforward multiplication, no percentages involved. So yeah, 15 times 12 is correct.

Another angle: perhaps the options are trying to trick me with similar numbers. Let me make sure I'm not mixing up any digits. 15 x 12 is 180, and option I is exactly that. So no confusion there. 

I think I'm confident that the answer is I.

The commission is calculated by multiplying the amount Fred receives per typewriter ($15) by the number of typewriters sold (12). 

15 Ã— 12 = 180.

Among the options, $180 corresponds to option I.

I
