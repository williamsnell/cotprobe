Okay, so I have this problem where I need to design a connecting bar for an agricultural engine. The bar is subjected to a compressive load of 90,000 lbs. Its length is 0.95 feet, and it's circular. The factor of safety is 3.0, and the modulus of elasticity E is 31 × 10^6 psi. I need to find the diameter of the bar from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that when designing such elements, we're probably dealing with column buckling because it's a compressive load. Columns can fail by buckling if they're slender enough. The critical load for buckling is given by Euler's formula, I think. Let me recall the formula.

Euler's formula for critical load is P_cr = (π² * E * I) / (L²), where I is the moment of inertia. But wait, that's for a column with pinned ends, right? I guess that's the assumption here, so it should apply.

First, I need to find the maximum allowable load, considering the factor of safety. The factor of safety (FS) is 3.0, so the allowable load P_allow = P_load / FS. Wait, no, wait. The applied load is the 90,000 lbs. So the critical load must be at least equal to the applied load multiplied by the factor of safety. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, factor of safety is the ratio of the critical load to the working load. So FS = P_cr / P_working. So P_working is the load applied, which is 90,000 lbs. So P_cr must be at least FS * P_working. That makes sense because if P_cr is higher than the applied load, the column won't buckle.

So P_cr = FS * P_working = 3.0 * 90,000 lbs = 270,000 lbs.

Wait, no. Wait, Factor of safety usually is the ratio of the failure load to the allowable load. So perhaps in this case, the allowable load (the load we can safely apply) is the applied load divided by the FS. Or maybe I'm getting this mixed up.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is P_allowable = P_cr / FS. So the applied load must be less than or equal to P_allowable. So P_cr = FS * P_allowable. But in this problem, the applied load is given as 90,000 lbs, so that would be the P_allowable. So P_cr needs to be at least FS * 90,000.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The factor of safety is defined as the ratio of the failure (or critical) load to the working (applied) load. So FS = P_failure / P_working. So P_failure = FS * P_working. So in this case, P_failure needs to be 3*90,000 = 270,000 lbs.

So I need to make sure that the Euler critical load is at least 270,000 lbs. That way, the column won't buckle under the applied load.

Now, using Euler's formula: P_cr = (π² * E * I) / (L²). I need to solve for I, the moment of inertia.

Wait, I is the moment of inertia for the cross-section. For a circular bar, I = (π d^4)/64, where d is the diameter.

So substituting I into Euler's formula:

P_cr = (π² * E * (π d^4 / 64)) ) / L².

Let me rearrange this to solve for d.

So,

d^4 = (P_cr * L² * 64) / (π² * E * π )

Simplify the denominator: π² * E * π = π^3 * E.

So,

d^4 = (P_cr * L² * 64) / (π^3 * E )

Then, d = [ (P_cr * L² * 64 ) / ( π^3 * E ) ]^(1/4)

Wait, let me plug in the numbers.

Given:

P_cr = 270,000 lbs.

L is 0.95 ft. But wait, in Euler's formula, the units need to be consistent. Because E is given in psi, which is pounds per square inch, the length should be in inches.

So 0.95 ft is 0.95 * 12 inches = 11.4 inches.

So L = 11.4 in.

E is 31e6 psi.

Putting it all together:

d^4 = (270000 lb * (11.4 in)^2 * 64 ) / ( π^3 * 31e6 psi )

Wait, let me compute each part step by step.

Calculate numerator:

270,000 * (11.4)^2 * 64

First, 11.4 squared: 11.4 * 11.4 = 129.96.

Then 270,000 * 129.96 = Let me compute that.

270,000 * 100 = 27,000,000.

270,000 * 29.96 = Hmm, 270,000 * 30 = 8,100,000, minus 270,000 * 0.04 = 10,800.

So 8,100,000 - 10,800 = 8,089,200.

Wait, but 270,000 * 129.96 is 270,000*(130-0.04) = 270,000*130 = 35,100,000 minus 270,000*0.04=10,800. So 35,100,000 - 10,800 = 35,089,200.

Wait, wait, no, 11.4 squared is 129.96 as I had before. So 270,000 * 129.96.

Wait, 270,000 * 100 = 27,000,000.

270,000 * 29.96 = 270,000 * 30 is 8,100,000 minus 270,000 * 0.04=10,800.

So 8,100,000 -10,800=8,089,200.

Wait, but 270,000 * 129.96 is 270,000*(130 - 0.04) = 270,000 *130 = 35,100,000, minus 270,000*0.04=10,800. So 35,100,000 -10,800=35,089,200.

So 270,000 * 129.96 = 35,089,200.

Multiply by 64: 35,089,200 *64.

Hmm, 35,089,200 *60 = 2,105,352,000.

35,089,200 *4 = 140,356,800.

Adding them gives 2,105,352,000 +140,356,800 = 2,245,708,800.

So numerator is 2,245,708,800 lb·in².

Denominator: π^3 *31e6.

Compute π^3. π is approximately 3.1416, so π^3 ≈ 31.006.

So denominator is 31.006 *31e6 psi.

Wait, 31.006 *31e6 = 31.006 *31 * 1e6.

31 *31=961, so 31.006 *31 ≈ 961.186.

So denominator is 961.186e6 psi, which is 9.61186e8 psi.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me re-calculate:

Wait, 31.006 *31 = (30 *31) + (1.006 *31) = 930 + 31.186= 961.186. So yes.

So denominator is 961.186e6 psi·in² (Wait, the units—denominator has E in psi, which is lb per in². So the denominator is in lb, because 31e6 psi is 31e6 lb/in². So when multiplied by π^3, it's in lb.)

Wait, no, the denominator is (π^3 * E ), which is (dimensionless) * (lb/in²) → lb/in². The numerator is in lb * in² → lb·in².

Wait, let me see:

Numerator: 270,000 lb * (11.4 in)^2 *64 → lb·in².

Denominator: π^3 * E → (lb/in²).

So d^4 = (lb·in²) / ( lb/in² ) → (in^4). So the units are correct.

So back to the numbers.

Numerator: 2,245,708,800 lb·in².

Denominator: 961.186e6 lb/in².

So d^4 = (2,245,708,800) / (961.186e6) → Let's compute this.

2,245,708,800 / 961,186,000 ≈ Let me compute the numbers.

Divide numerator and denominator by 1e6: 2,245.7088 / 961.186.

Approximately 2.335.

Wait, let me compute 961.186 *2.3 → 961.186*2=1922.372, 961.186*0.3=288.3558 → total 2210.7278.

Which is less than 2245.7.

Wait, 2.3 gives 2210.7, 2.33 gives 961.186*(2.33)= ?

2.33 = 2 + 0.33.

2 *961.186=1922.372.

0.33 *961.186≈ 317.191.

So total 1922.372 + 317.191= 2239.563.

Which is close to 2245.7088.

The difference is 2245.7088 -2239.563=6.1458.

So 6.1458 /961.186 ≈ 0.0064.

So total multiplier is approx 2.33 +0.0064=2.3364.

So d^4 ≈ 2.3364.

Then, d = (2.3364)^(1/4).

Hmm, the fourth root of 2.3364. Let me compute this.

I know that 2^4=16, but that's for larger numbers. Wait, wait, no—wait, 2^4=16, but we're dealing with 2.3364 as the value of d^4.

Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, d^4 is 2.3364. So d is the fourth root of 2.3364.

Wait, let me compute 1.4^4: 1.4^2=1.96, 1.96^2=3.8416. That's too big.

So try 1.3^4: 1.3^2=1.69 → 1.69^2=2.8561. Still higher than 2.3364.

1.2^4: 1.44^2=2.0736. So 2.0736 is less than 2.3364.

So between 1.2 and 1.3.

Let me try 1.25: 1.25^4 = (1.25^2)^2 = (1.5625)^2 = 2.4414. Hmm, 2.4414 is higher than 2.3364. So the value is between 1.2 and 1.25.

Let me compute 1.23^4:

1.23^2 = 1.5129.

1.5129^2 = approx (1.5^2)=2.25, but more accurately:

(1.5129)^2 = (1.5 + 0.0129)^2 = 1.5^2 + 2*(1.5)(0.0129) + (0.0129)^2 = 2.25 + 0.0387 + 0.000166= 2.288866.

Hmm, 2.288866 is less than 2.3364. So try 1.24.

1.24^2 = 1.5376.

1.5376^2 = Let's compute that.

1.5^2=2.25.

0.0376^2= approx 0.001414.

Cross terms: 2*(1.5)(0.0376)= 0.1128.

So (1.5+0.0376)^2= 2.25 + 0.1128 + 0.001414≈ 2.3642.

So 1.24^4≈2.3642.

We have d^4=2.3364, which is between 1.23^4 (2.2888) and 1.24^4 (2.3642).

So let's do a linear approximation.

The difference between 1.23 and 1.24 in d is 0.01 in, and the d^4 increases by 2.3642-2.2888=0.0754.

We need d^4=2.3364. The target is 2.3364 -2.2888=0.0476 above 1.23^4.

So 0.0476 / 0.0754 ≈ 0.631 of the interval.

So d≈1.23 +0.631*(0.01)=1.23 +0.00631=1.2363 in.

So approximately 1.236 inches.

Looking at the options, option F is 1.236 in. So that's the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake.

Alternative approach: Let's compute d^4 = 2.3364.

So d is the fourth root. Let me compute 1.23^4=2.2888, as before.

1.235^4?

Compute 1.235^2=1.235 *1.235.

Let me compute that:

1.235 *1.235:

1*1=1.

1*.235=0.235.

.235*1=0.235.

.235*.235= approx 0.0552.

Wait, perhaps better to compute it step by step.

1.235 * 1.235:

= (1 + 0.2 + 0.03 + 0.005) * same.

Alternatively, 1235 * 1235 = ?

Well, but perhaps a better approach is to compute 1.235^2:

1.235 *1.235:

Multiply as (1.2 + 0.035)^2 = 1.44 + 2*(1.2)(0.035) + 0.035^2.

1.44 + (0.084) + 0.001225 = 1.525225.

So 1.235^2 ≈1.5252.

Then 1.5252^2 = (1.5252)^2.

Compute that:

1.5^2=2.25.

0.0252^2≈0.000635.

Cross term: 2*1.5*0.0252=0.0756.

So (1.5+0.0252)^2= 2.25 + 0.0756 +0.000635≈2.3262.

So 1.235^4≈2.3262, which is close to our target of 2.3364.

The difference is 2.3364-2.3262=0.0102.

Each increment of 0.001 in d would increase d^4 by approximately how much? Let's see, the derivative of d^4 at d=1.235 is 4*d^3.

At d=1.235, d^3≈1.235^3= approx 1.235 *1.5252 ≈1.885.

So 4*1.885≈7.54.

So each 0.001 increase in d would increase d^4 by about 7.54 *0.001=0.00754.

We need an increase of 0.0102, so 0.0102 / 0.00754 ≈1.353. So about 0.00135 increase in d.

So d≈1.235 +0.00135≈1.23635 in.

Which rounds to approximately 1.236 in.

Looking back at the options, option F is 1.236 in. So that's the correct answer.

To design the connecting bar, we need to ensure it can withstand the compressive load without buckling. The problem involves calculating the minimum diameter of a circular bar using Euler's formula for column buckling, considering a factor of safety (FS) of 3.0. Here's the analysis:

### Key Equations and Parameters:
1. **Euler's formula for critical load**:  
   \[
   P_{\text{cr}} = \frac{\pi^2 \cdot E \cdot I}{L^2}
   \]
   where \(I\) is the moment of inertia of the cross-section.

2. **Moment of inertia for a circular bar**:  
   \[
   I = \frac{\pi d^4}{64}
   \]

3. **Factor of safety**:  
   \[
   P_{\text{cr}} = \text{FS} \cdot P_{\text{working}}
   \]

4. **Given values**:  
   - \(P_{\text{working}} = 90,000 \, \text{lbs}\),  
   - \(\text{FS} = 3.0\),  
   - \(E = 31 \times 10^6 \, \text{psi}\),  
   - \(L = 0.95 \, \text{ft} = 11.4 \, \text{in}\).

### Step 1: Calculate the critical load
\[
P_{\text{cr}} = \text{FS} \cdot P_{\text{working}} = 3.0 \cdot 90,000 = 270,000 \, \text{lbs}
\]

### Step 2: Rearrange Euler's formula to solve for \(d^4\)
Substitute \(I = \frac{\pi d^4}{64}\) into Euler's formula:
\[
P_{\text{cr}} = \frac{\pi^2 \cdot E \cdot \frac{\pi d^4}{64}}{L^2}
\]
\[
d^4 = \frac{P_{\text{cr}} \cdot L^2 \cdot 64}{\pi^3 \cdot E}
\]

### Step 3: Plug in the values
\[
d^4 = \frac{270,000 \cdot 11.4^2 \cdot 64
