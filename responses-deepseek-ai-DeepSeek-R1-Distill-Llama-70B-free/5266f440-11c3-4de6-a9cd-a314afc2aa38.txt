Okay, so I've got this physics problem about thermal expansion. Hmm, I remember that when materials are heated, they expand. The problem involves a copper bar, and I need to find out how much its length increases when the temperature changes. 

Let me read the problem again. The copper bar is 8.0 feet long at 68°F. The linear expansivity is given as 9.4e-6 per degree Fahrenheit. They're heating it up to 110°F, so I need to find the increase in length.

Wait, linear expansivity is the coefficient of linear expansion, right? The formula for linear expansion is delta L equals alpha times L0 times delta T. Where delta L is the change in length, alpha is the linear expansivity, L0 is the original length, and delta T is the change in temperature.

So first, I should find delta T. The initial temperature is 68°F, and the final is 110°F. So delta T is 110 minus 68. Let me calculate that. 110 minus 60 is 50, but wait, 68 is two more, so 110-68 is 42°F. Oh wait, no, 68 plus 42 is 110? Let me check: 68 plus 40 is 108, plus 2 is 110. Yep, delta T is 42°F.

Now, plug into the formula. Alpha is 9.4e-6 per °F. L0 is 8.0 ft. So delta L = (9.4e-6) * 8.0 * 42.

Wait, let me compute this step by step. Multiply 8.0 and 42 first. 8 times 40 is 320, 8 times 2 is 16, so 336. So 8 * 42 = 336. So then, 9.4e-6 multiplied by 336.

Let me compute 9.4e-6 * 336. Let's see, 9.4 times 336. Hmm. 9 * 336 is 3024, 0.4 * 336 is 134.4, so total is 3024 +134.4 = 3158.4. But wait, wait, that's without the exponent. Oh right, because 9.4e-6 is 9.4 times 10^-6. So 3158.4 * 1e-6 is 0.0031584 feet.

Wait, but let me check the calculations again. Alternatively, maybe I should compute 9.4e-6 * 8.0 first. 8 times 9.4 is 75.6, so 75.6e-6. Then multiply by 42. 75.6e-6 * 42 = ?

Let me calculate 75.6 *42. 70*42=2940, 5.6*42=235.2, so total is 2940 + 235.2 = 3175.2. Then multiply by 1e-6, so 3175.2e-6 feet. Wait, 3175.2e-6 is the same as 0.0031752 feet.

Hmm, so I'm getting approximately 0.0031752 feet. Let me see the options. The options are:

A: 0.0032 ft

B: 0.0064 ft

C: 0.0035 ft

D: 0.0028 ft

E: 0.0050 ft

F: 0.0015 ft

G: 0.0048 ft

H: 0.0021 ft

I: 0.0038 ft

J: 0.0042 ft

Looking at the numbers, 0.003175 is closest to 0.0032 (option A) or perhaps 0.0035 option C, but 0.00318 is closer to 0.0032.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the calculation? Let me double-check. Let's calculate 9.4e-6 * 8.0 *42.

First, 8 *42 = 336.

Then 9.4e-6 * 336 = ?

9.4 * 336 = let's compute 9 *336 = 3024 and 0.4*336=134.4. So 3024 +134.4 = 3158.4. Then multiply by 1e-6, so 0.0031584 ft.

So approximately 0.00316 ft. The options have 0.0032 as option A. Alternatively, perhaps I should be more precise. Let me compute 3158.4 *1e-6.

3158.4 *1e-6 = 0.0031584 ft, which is about 0.00316 ft. So the closest option is A: 0.0032 ft. But wait, that's 0.0032, which is 0.000042 ft more than my calculated value. Are there any options that are closer? Let me see: option I is 0.0038, which is higher. Option C is 0.0035, which is a bit higher. So 0.00316 is closest to 0.0032 (A) than to 0.0035 (C).

Wait another thing—did I calculate delta T correctly? Initial temp is 68 F, final is 110 F. 110-68 is indeed 42 F. So that part seems right.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate 9.4e-6 *8.0 *42.

Wait, 8.0 *42 = 336, correct. 9.4e-6 * 336: 9.4e-6 is 0.0000094. 0.0000094 multiplied by 336.

Let me compute this as 336 *0.0000094.

336 * 0.0000094 = ?

Hmm, 336 *9.4 = 3158.4, and since it's 0.0000094, that's 3158.4 * 1e-6 = 0.0031584 ft. So yeah, 0.0031584 ft.

Looking at the options, the closest is A: 0.0032 ft. But wait, that's within 0.00004 ft. Alternatively, perhaps option I is 0.0038, which is larger. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait another approach: Let me calculate 9.4e-6 * (8.0) * (42). So 8.0 *42 is 336. 9.4 *336 = ?

Compute 9 * 336 = 3024, 0.4 *336=134.4, sum is 3158.4. Multiply by 1e-6: 0.0031584 ft.

So approximately 0.003158 ft. The options are A:0.0032, which is 0.0032. The difference is 0.0032 - 0.0031584 = 0.0000416. So about 0.00004 ft less than option A.

But looking at the options, is there a closer value? Let's see the options again:

Option A:0.0032 (0.0032)

Option I:0.0038 (0.0038)

Option C:0.0035

So the exact value is approximately 0.003158, which is 0.00316 when rounded to four decimal places. Now, 0.00316 is 3.16 x 1e-3 ft. 

Looking at the options, the closest is option A (0.0032), but it's a bit higher. Alternatively, perhaps I should check my calculations again for any possible mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me try 9.4 * 336.

Let's compute 336 * 9 = 3024.

336 * 0.4 = 134.4.

So 3024 +134.4 = 3158.4.

Yes, that's correct.

So 3158.4 * 1e-6 is 0.0031584 ft.

So the correct answer would be approximately 0.00316 ft.

Looking at the options, A is 0.0032, which is 0.0032. The difference between 0.00316 and 0.0032 is 0.00004, which is 4e-5. Are any other options closer?

Wait, option I is 0.0038, which is 0.0006 higher than 0.00316. So A is closer. Therefore, the correct answer should be option A.

Wait, but wait another thought: sometimes when you have thermal expansion, the formula could be written as delta_L = alpha * L0 * delta_T, but perhaps I should ensure the units are correct. Because in this case, the expansivity is given in per Fahrenheit, and the temperatures are in F, so no conversion needed. So that's correct.

So probably the correct answer is A: 0.0032 ft.

To determine the increase in length of the copper bar when heated, we use the formula for linear thermal expansion:

\[
\Delta L = \alpha \cdot L_0 \cdot \Delta T
\]

Where:
- \( \alpha = 9.4 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{°F}^{-1} \) (linear expansivity of copper),
- \( L_0 = 8.0 \, \text{ft} \) (original length of the bar),
- \( \Delta T = T_{\text{final}} - T_{\text{initial}} = 110 \, \text{°F} - 68 \, \text{°F} = 42 \, \text{°F} \).

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta L = (9.4 \times 10^{-6}) \cdot 8.0 \cdot 42
\]

First, calculate \( 8.0 \cdot 42 = 336 \). Then:

\[
\Delta L = (9.4 \times 10^{-6}) \cdot 336 = 0.0031584 \, \text{ft}
\]

This value rounds to approximately \( 0.00316 \, \text{ft} \). Comparing this result to the provided options:

- **A: 0.0032 ft** is the closest to \( 0.00316 \, \text{ft} \), with a small difference of \( 0.000042 \, \text{ft} \).
- Other options, such as **C: 0.0035 ft** or **I: 0.0038 ft**, are farther from the calculated value.

Thus, the best match is **A: 0.0032 ft**.
