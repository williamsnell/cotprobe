Okay, so I've got this question about heritability in a cloned population, and I'm trying to figure it out. Hmm, let's start by recalling what heritability means. From what I remember, heritability is the proportion of observable differences in a trait among individuals that can be attributed to genetic differences. So it's like, if a trait varies in a population, heritability tells us how much of that variation is due to genetics versus environmental factors.

Wait, but waitâ€”cloned populations. Clones are genetically identical, right? Because cloning produces organisms with the same DNA as the original. So in a cloned population, all individuals have the same genotype for the traits we're considering. So if everyone's genes are the same, then any variation in the trait must come from the environment, not genetics.

Heriability is calculated as the ratio of the variance of the trait due to genetics (Vg) over the total variance (Vp), which includes both genetics and environment (Ve). So heritability (H) = Vg / (Vg + Ve). 

In a cloned population, since all the genetic variance is zero (because they're clones), Vg is zero. So plugging that into the formula, H becomes 0/(0 + Ve) which is 0. So the heritability would be zero.

Wait, but let me think again. Heritability is about the variation in the population. If there's no genetic variation (because clones are identical), then any variation in the trait isn't due to genetics. So yeah, heritability would be zero.

Looking at the options, option J is 0%. So the answer should be J.

Heritability refers to the proportion of observable differences in a trait among individuals that can be attributed to genetic differences. In a cloned population, all individuals are genetically identical, meaning there is no genetic variation (Vg = 0). Since heritability is calculated as the ratio of genetic variance to total variance (H = Vg / (Vg + Ve)), the absence of genetic variance results in heritability being zero. Therefore, in a cloned population, any variation in traits must be due to environmental factors, not genetics.

The correct answer is J: 0%.
