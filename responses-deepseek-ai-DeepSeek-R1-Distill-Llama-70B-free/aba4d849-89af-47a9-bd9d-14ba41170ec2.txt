Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why Pizarro was able to subdue the entire Inca empire. I remember from my history classes that Pizarro was a Spanish conquistador, and he was involved in the conquest of the Inca Empire in the 16th century. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact reasons. Let me think through this.

First, the options given are A through J. I'll go through them one by one.

Option A: The Incas were suffering from a plague when Pizarro arrived. I think there was some disease involved, but wasn't that more in the case of the Aztecs with Cortes? Or maybe it was smallpox that spread before Pizarro arrived. I'm not sure if it was a plague at the exact time he came.

Option B: The empire had never won the allegiance of the conquered peoples. That makes sense because empires often have subjects who aren't loyal, which can lead to internal conflicts. If the Incas didn't have the support of all the people they ruled, it would be easier for an outsider to gain allies among those discontented groups.

Option C: The Incas were already weakened by a civil war. Oh right, I remember something about a civil war right before Pizarro arrived. The Inca Empire was in the middle of a succession crisis, with two brothers fighting for the throne. This would have weakened their ability to respond to an external threat.

Option D: The Incas were expecting Pizarro and willingly surrendered. That doesn't sound right. I don't think they expected the Spanish to come, and they definitely didn't surrender willingly. They put up a fight, but the Spanish had superior tactics and technology.

Option E: He arrived with a superior force of more than 80,000 soldiers. Wait, that seems way too high. I thought Pizarro had a very small force, maybe a couple hundred men. So E is probably incorrect because the numbers are way off.

Option F: Pizarro used advanced technology that the Incas couldn't comprehend. Well, the Spanish did have guns and armor, which were new to the Incas. But I'm not sure if that alone was the main reason. It probably played a role, but maybe not the primary one.

Option G: His horses and guns frightened the Incas into submission. Horses were definitely new to the Americas, and the noise and fire from guns would have been terrifying. That might have contributed, but perhaps it's part of a bigger picture.

Option H: Pizarro had the support of other native tribes who were enemies of the Incas. This sounds plausible. If local tribes were against the Incas, they might have allied with the Spanish, providing manpower and intelligence. That would make it easier to conquer.

Option I: He was such a brilliant military strategist. Pizarro was a skilled leader, but I think the key factors were more about the condition of the Inca Empire rather than just his personal abilities.

Option J: Pizarro manipulated the Incas into believing he was a god. I think Cortes did something like that with the Aztecs, playing on their religious beliefs. But I'm not sure if Pizarro did the same. The Incas might have seen him as a divine being, but I don't know if that was the main reason for their defeat.

Putting it all together, the most significant factors were probably the civil war weakening the empire and the Spanish gaining allies among the discontented tribes. So options C and H seem likely. But the question is asking for the main reason Pizarro subdued the empire.

Wait, I think the civil war was a huge factor. The Inca Empire was divided, and Pizarro exploited that division. He captured the emperor, Atahualpa, during this conflict, which threw the empire into chaos. So option C might be the best answer.

Alternatively, option H is about support from other tribes. I'm trying to recall if the Spanish had help from local groups. I think they did form alliances with groups that were tired of Inca rule, which would have provided them with more manpower and local support. So both C and H are strong possibilities.

But the question is phrased as "largely because," so which was the main reason. I'm leaning towards C because the civil war had already weakened the empire before Pizarro even arrived, making it easier for him to take control with a small force. Without that internal conflict, the Incas might have been able to put up a much stronger resistance.

So I think the correct answer is C: The Incas were already weakened by a civil war.

The ability of Pizarro to subdue the Inca Empire can be attributed to several factors, but the most significant reason was the internal weakness of the empire at the time of his arrival. The Inca Empire was embroiled in a civil war, a succession conflict between two brothers, Atahualpa and Huascar, which had severely weakened its political and military structures. This division made it difficult for the empire to mount an effective resistance against the Spanish conquistadors. Pizarro exploited this internal strife, capturing Atahualpa and further destabilizing the empire. While other factors, such as the use of advanced technology and alliances with discontented local tribes, played a role, the civil war was the primary condition that facilitated Pizarro's conquest.
