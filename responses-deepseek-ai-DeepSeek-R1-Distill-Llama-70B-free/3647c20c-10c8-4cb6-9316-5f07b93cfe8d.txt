Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the Leiter International Performance Scale. I'm a bit rusty on my psychology tests, but let me think this through step by step.

The question is asking which group the Leiter scale is most useful for measuring intelligence. The options are from A to J, each describing different demographics.

First, I remember that the Leiter scale is an intelligence test. I think it's used for assessing non-verbal intelligence. Oh right, because it's called a "performance" scale, which probably means it's more about doing tasks rather than verbal questions.

Wait, who uses non-verbal tests? Well, typically, non-verbal tests are good for people who can't speak much or understand verbal instructions. So maybe young children who haven't developed speech yet, or people with hearing impairments or speech impairments.

But I'm trying to recall specifics about the Leiter. I think it's primarily used with children. I remember that the Leiter scale doesn't require verbal responses, which makes it useful for kids who are very young or those who have hearing or speech issues.

So looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: adults with speech impairments. Hmm, the test might be applicable, but is it mainly for adults? I thought it's more for children.

Option B: children under two. That makes sense because very young children can't do verbal tests. They might use non-verbal tasks like pointing or matching.

Option C: adults who are mentally retarded. I'm not sure, but the term is outdated, but regardless, the Leiter is probably not the first choice for adults.

Option D: adults with physical disabilities. They might need non-verbal tests, but again, I'm not sure if Leiter targets adults.

Option E: children with hearing impairments. They can't do verbal tests, so a non-verbal one makes sense. But is that the primary use of Leiter?

Option F: children with learning disabilities. Maybe, but learning disabilities can vary. Some might need non-verbal, others might not.

Option G: children with visual impairments. Wait, the Leiter uses visual tasks, so if a child can't see, that might not work. Unless the test is adapted.

Option H: elderly with memory loss. Probably not, as their tests might focus more on verbal or different cognitive areas.

Option I: teenagers with emotional disorders. Their testing might depend on other factors, but I don't think Leiter is for teens.

Option J: adults with visual impairments. Again, the test is visual, so visual impairment would be a problem.

Hmm, so the Leiter is for children, not adults. So options B, E, F, G are the possible ones.

Wait, I think the Leiter is used for children who can't do verbal tests, like those under two or those with hearing or speech issues. But the question is about who it's most useful for. Let me think about the target age.

Leiter's original scale was designed for children aged 2 to 18, I think. Oh wait, but some sources say it's primarily for younger children, maybe under two. Or perhaps it's a broader age range but without relying on verbal instructions.

Wait, another thought: the Leiter scale uses gestures and non-verbal instructions, making it suitable for children who are non-verbal or have hearing impairments. But the question is about the most useful application.

The options are B: under two, E: children with hearing impairments, G: children with visual.

Wait, the Leiter test uses visual and motor tasks, so children with visual impairments (G) might not be able to take it. So the correct group would be those without visual issues but with hearing or speech issues.

So between B and E and maybe others.

Wait, the Leiter is often used with children who are too young to understand verbal instructions, like under two. So option B could be correct.

But I'm a bit confused because some sources say it's used for children with hearing impairments as well. So which is the primary use?

Alternatively, it's designed for assessing children's non-verbal intelligence, so it's useful for any child who can't perform verbal tasks, which would include under two, hearing impaired, etc.

Looking back at the options, perhaps the best fit is B: children under two, because that's a specific group that can't handle verbal tests. But I'm not 100% certain.

Wait, another angle: the Leiter scale is a performance scale, meaning it's more about hands-on tasks. It's known for being used with children who can't do verbal tests for any reasonâ€”like being too young or having hearing issues.

So in the options, E is children with hearing impairments. B is under two.

Which is more appropriate? Since the test is often used for children aged 2 and up, perhaps not under two. So maybe the primary use is for children with hearing impairments.

Wait, now I'm getting myself confused. Let me try to think of the original purpose of the Leiter. The Leiter International Performance Scale was designed to measure non-verbal intelligence, using a series of performance tasks that don't require spoken language. It's often used with children who have speech or hearing impairments, or where language differences might be a barrier.

So perhaps the primary group is children with hearing impairments (option E). But another thought: children under two might not have the motor skills for some of the tasks. Or maybe the Leiter starts at a certain age.

Alternatively, the Leiter is suitable for children from 2 years old and up. So under two (option B) might be too young.

So if the test is for children aged 2 and above, then the best fit would be children with hearing impairments (E) or perhaps children with visual impairments can't take it because it's visually based.

Wait, no, the Leiter uses visual and motor tasks, so children with visual impairments wouldn't be able to take it. Therefore, it's more suitable for children with hearing impairments.

So perhaps the correct answer is E.

Alternatively, I've also heard that the Leiter is often used with children who are non-verbal or have limited language, which would include those under two as well as those with hearing impairments.

But looking back, the options are:

B: children under two.

E: children with hearing impairments.

Which is more correct? I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps the Leiter is particularly useful for children who cannot understand verbal instructions, such as those under two or those with hearing impairments. So the question is, which is the primary group.

Alternatively, the Leiter is used for assessing children's intelligence when verbal tests aren't suitable, which could be for various reasons, but the options are specific.

Another approach: I think the Leiter is used for children from 2 to 18 years old, focusing on non-verbal intelligence. So the test is for children who can't take verbal tests, which could be due to age (like 2 and up, but maybe even younger) or hearing issues.

So in the options given, B is children under two, but if the Leiter is for 2 and up, then B isn't correct. So the best fit would be E: children with hearing impairments.

Wait, but option G is children with visual impairments, which can't take the test. So the correct group is those who can see but can't hear, making E the right answer.

Alternatively, the Leiter is used for children who are too young to understand verbal instructions, which would include those under two.

Wait, but if the test starts at two, then under two isn't applicable. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the Leiter is used for children aged 3 to 18, but I'm not sure.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to recall: the Leiter is a non-verbal intelligence test for children. It's often used when a child can't understand spoken language, which includes hearing-impaired children and very young children.

So the options are B and E. So which one is more correct.

Wait, the Leiter is suitable for children as young as two, so under two (B) might be too young, but some sources say it's used for under two. Alternatively, it's for children aged 2 to 18, making B (under two) not applicable.

So if the Leiter is for 2 and above, then B isn't correct.

Wait, the Leiter test is for children from 2 years up, so children under two (option B) are too young. Therefore, the correct group would be children with hearing impairments (option E).

Alternatively, perhaps the Leiter can be used for children under two, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the Leiter is most useful for children who can't take verbal tests, regardless of age.

Wait, the question is about the most useful application. So if the Leiter is used for children with hearing impairments, that would be the best fit.

So the answer would be E.

Wait, but another thought: the Leiter is also used for assessing children with limited speech, which could include those under two as well as those with impairments.

But among the options, B is children under two, and E is children with hearing impairments.

I think the Leiter is primarily used for children with hearing impairments, making E the correct answer.

But I'm not entirely sure. Some sources say it's used for children aged 2-18, which includes those who can't speak or have hearing issues.

Alternatively, the correct answer is B, children under two, because they can't handle verbal tests.

Wait, I'm getting myself more confused. Let me try to think of the key points.

The Leiter International Performance Scale is a non-verbal intelligence test. It doesn't require the test taker to read, write, speak, or understand speech. Therefore, it's suitable for:

- Young children (like under two) who haven't developed speech yet.

- Children with hearing impairments who can't understand spoken instructions.

So both B and E could be correct, but the options are separate.

But the question is, which is the most useful application. The Leiter is often primarily noted for being used with children who have hearing impairments, so perhaps E is the answer.

Alternatively, considering that children under two are a specific group that the Leiter is designed for, perhaps B is correct.

Wait, I think the Leiter is used for children from 2 years and older, so children under two (option B) might be too young. So the correct answer would be E: children with hearing impairments.

I think that's the case. So the answer is E.

The Leiter International Performance Scale is a non-verbal intelligence test designed to assess cognitive abilities without requiring verbal responses. It is particularly useful for individuals who cannot understand or produce speech, such as young children or those with hearing impairments. The test uses visual and motor tasks, making it unsuitable for individuals with visual impairments.

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Adults with speech impairments**  
  While the test could theoretically be used for adults with speech impairments, it is primarily designed for children.

- **B: Children under the age of two**  
  The Leiter scale is often used for young children, but it is typically designed for children aged 2 and above. Children under two may be too young for the test.

- **C: Adults who are mentally retarded**  
  The test is not specifically designed for adults or for assessing intellectual disabilities in adults.

- **D: Adults with physical disabilities**  
  While non-verbal tests can be useful for adults with physical disabilities, the Leiter is primarily intended for children.

- **E: Children with hearing impairments**  
  This is a key group for whom the Leiter is particularly useful, as it does not require spoken language or auditory comprehension.

- **F: Children with learning disabilities**  
  While the test could be used for some children with learning disabilities, it is not its primary focus.

- **G: Children with visual impairments**  
  The test relies heavily on visual tasks, making it unsuitable for children with visual impairments.

- **H: Elderly people with memory loss**  
  The Leiter is not designed for elderly populations or for assessing memory loss.

- **I: Teenagers with emotional disorders**  
  The test is not typically used for teenagers or for assessing emotional disorders.

- **J: Adults with visual impairments**  
  Like option G, the test is unsuitable for individuals with visual impairments.

The Leiter International Performance Scale is most useful for children who cannot understand verbal instructions, such as those with hearing impairments. While it can also be used for young children, the primary and most appropriate application is for children with hearing impairments.
