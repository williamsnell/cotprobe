Question:

A man and a woman agreed that the woman would rob a bank and that the man would steal a car beforehand for the woman to use as a getaway vehicle. The man stole a car and parked it two blocks from the bank. He left the car key under the floor mat with a note saying that he wanted nothing more to do with the scheme. The next day, the woman robbed the bank and ran to the spot where the man had said he would leave the stolen car. She then escaped in the car and disappeared. She never shared any of the money with the man. In a jurisdiction that has adopted the bilateral requirement for conspiracy, can the man properly be convicted of conspiring with the woman to rob the bank?

Options:

A: Yes, because the man was a part of the initial planning of the robbery.
B: Yes, because the man committed a crime (stealing a car) in furtherance of the conspiracy.
C: Yes, because the robbery was successful due in part to the man's actions.
D: Yes, because the man provided the getaway vehicle.
E: Yes, because there was an agreement to rob the bank and an overt act in furtherance of the agreement.
F: No, because the man expressed his intention to withdraw from the conspiracy.
G: No, because the man received no benefit from the robbery.
H: No, because the woman did not share the money with the man.
I: No, because the man did not participate in the actual robbery.

Okay, so I need to figure out whether the man can be convicted of conspiracy to rob the bank. Let me start by understanding the scenario.

The man and woman agreed that she would rob a bank, and he would steal a car for her getaway. He stole the car, parked it near the bank, left the key with a note saying he wanted nothing more to do with the scheme. The next day, she robbed the bank, used the car, and didn't share the money.

The question is about conspiracy under a jurisdiction that requires the bilateral requirement. I remember that conspiracy requires an agreement between two or more people to commit a crime, and an overt act in furtherance of that agreement. The bilateral requirement means that both parties must actually agreeâ€”so if one person changes their mind or withdraws, it affects the conspiracy.

In this case, the man initially agreed to help by stealing the car. He did steal it and left it for her. But he also left a note saying he wanted nothing more to do with it. So maybe he tried to withdraw from the conspiracy.

Wait, but in some jurisdictions, once an overt act is committed, withdrawal isn't possible without more. Or does the withdrawal have to happen before the overt act? Hmm. The man had already provided the car, which was an overt act. Then he tried to withdraw by leaving the note.

But I think the key point is whether his withdrawal was effective. If the withdrawal is before any overt acts, then he might not be liable. But if the overt act has already been done, maybe he's still on the hook.

Wait, in this situation, the man stole the car (overt act) and then tried to withdraw. But the woman went ahead and used it. So does his withdrawal after the overt act matter?

In the bilateral conspiracy model, both parties must agree at the same time. If he withdrew, perhaps the conspiracy ended. But I'm not sure if his withdrawal was effective if the other party still went through with it.

Alternatively, maybe the initial agreement is enough. Once they agreed and at least one overt act was done, the conspiracy exists. His later withdrawal might be a defense, but it depends on the timing.

Wait, another point: conspiracy requires that both parties have the specific intent to agree. If one party withdraws, does that break the conspiracy? So if the man withdrew, maybe the conspiracy no longer exists because the bilateral agreement is gone.

But in this case, the man had already committed the overt act (stealing the car) before trying to withdraw. So maybe the conspiracy was formed when he agreed and then committed the act. His withdrawal might not undo the conspiracy that's already been formed and acted upon.

Wait, but the bilateral requirement says that both must agree. So if he withdrew, then the agreement is no longer mutual. But the woman still went ahead. Does that mean she can't conspire alone? Or does the initial agreement suffice even if he later withdraws?

I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the elements again. Conspiracy requires:

1. An agreement between two or more people to commit a crime.
2. The intent to enter into that agreement.
3. An overt act in furtherance of the agreement.

Once these are met, conspiracy is formed. If one person withdraws before the overt act, maybe they're not liable, but if the overt act is done, withdrawal might not help because the conspiracy has already been completed.

In this case, the man committed the overt act (stealing the car) as part of the conspiracy. Then he tried to withdraw. But the woman used the car anyway. So the question is, does his withdrawal after the overt act negate his participation in the conspiracy.

Alternatively, since he withdrew, perhaps the agreement was no longer bilateral. But since the overt act was already done, it's possible that the conspiracy was already formed, and his withdrawal doesn't undo that.

Wait, but in some cases, withdrawal before the commission of any overt acts might mean no conspiracy. But here, the overt act was already done. So the conspiracy was formed, and the man was part of it. His later withdrawal might not absolve him of the conspiracy charge because the conspiracy had already been effectuated.

So looking at the options, let's see.

Option A: Yes, because he was part of initial planning. That's true, but planning alone isn't enough without an agreement and overt act.

Option B: Yes, because he committed a crime (stealing) in furtherance. That seems accurate because he did an overt act.

Option E: Yes, because agreement and overt act. That fits.

But wait, the man tried to withdraw. So does that affect the conspiracy?

Hmm, I think the withdrawal comes after the overt act. So the conspiracy was already formed and the overt act done. His withdrawal might be too late. So he's still part of the conspiracy.

Therefore, the answer would be yes, he can be convicted.

Looking at the options, E says yes because there was an agreement and overt act. So E could be the correct answer.

Wait, but the bilateral requirement: if the man withdrew, perhaps the bilateral aspect is gone. But the key is that at the time of the agreement and overt act, both were on board. So even if he later withdrew, the conspiracy was already formed.

So yes, the man can be convicted because there was an agreement and an overt act in furtherance. So the correct answer would be E.

Wait but option B says yes because he committed a crime in furtherance. That's also correct, but E is more precise because it addresses the elements of conspiracy.

Alternatively, perhaps the withdrawal doesn't matter because the conspiracy was already formed, so B and E could both be considered.

But the question is about whether he can be convicted, and in a bilateral jurisdiction, perhaps the withdrawal after the overt act doesn't matter because the conspiracy was already formed.

So I think the answer is E.

To determine whether the man can be convicted of conspiring with the woman to rob the bank, we must analyze the elements of conspiracy under a jurisdiction that follows the bilateral requirement. Conspiracy requires:

1. **An agreement** between two or more people to commit a crime.
2. **The intent to enter into that agreement**.
3. **An overt act in furtherance of the agreement**.

In this case, the man and the woman initially agreed to work together: the woman would rob the bank, and the man would provide a stolen car as a getaway vehicle. The man fulfilled his part by stealing the car and leaving it for the woman, which constitutes an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy. Although the man later attempted to withdraw from the scheme by leaving a note, the critical point is that the overt act (stealing and providing the car) had already been completed. 

Under the bilateral requirement, the conspiracy was formed when the agreement was made and the overt act was committed. The man's subsequent withdrawal does not negate the fact that the conspiracy had already been established and acted upon. Therefore, the man can still be held liable for the conspiracy.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: While the man was part of the initial planning, planning alone is insufficient without an agreement and an overt act.
- **B**: The man did commit a crime (stealing the car) in furtherance of the conspiracy, which is accurate, but this option does not address the full elements of conspiracy.
- **C**: The success of the robbery due to the man's actions is a consequence but not the legal basis for conspiracy.
- **D**: Providing the getaway vehicle is part of the overt act but does not fully capture the elements of conspiracy.
- **E**: This option correctly identifies that the conspiracy was formed based on the agreement and the overt act in furtherance of the agreement, making it the most precise answer.
- **F, G, H, I**: These options focus on the man's withdrawal, lack of benefit, or non-participation in the robbery, which are irrelevant because the conspiracy was already formed and acted upon before his withdrawal.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**E: Yes, because there was an agreement to rob the bank and an overt act in furtherance of the agreement.**

Answer: E
