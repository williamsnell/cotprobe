Okay, so I have this question about mergesort and data structures. Hmm, I remember that mergesort is a sorting algorithm that uses a divide and conquer approach. Let me think. It splits the list into halves, sorts each half, and then merges them back together. 

The question is asking which data structures allow mergesort to work in O(n log n) time. The options are a singly linked list, doubly linked list, and an array. The options given are I, II, III, and the answer choices are combinations of these.

Wait, I think the time complexity of mergesort depends on how efficiently we can split and merge the data structures. Let me recall. Mergesort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the worst case when using certain data structures. 

When using an array, accessing elements by index is O(1), right? So splitting the array into two halves is straightforward. Each recursive call deals with a contiguous block, which is efficient. Merging also is efficient because you can directly access elements from both halves without extra overhead. So arrays are good because they allow random access, making the split and merge steps O(n) each, leading to the overall O(n log n) time.

Now, what about linked lists? Let's see. A singly linked list only allows traversal in one direction. To split the list into two halves, you need to find the middle point. Oh wait, finding the middle of a singly linked list can be done in linear time, right? Like using the slow and fast pointer technique. So for splitting, that's manageable. 

But when merging, how does that work? Because in mergesort, after splitting, each half is sorted and then merged. For linked lists, merging two sorted lists is actually pretty efficient. Since you don't need to shift elements like in an array, you just adjust the pointers. So the merge step for linked lists can be O(n), just like arrays. 

Wait, but what about the splitting part? Because for each recursive call, you're splitting the list into two. For a linked list, each split would involve creating new head nodes or something. But does that affect the time complexity? I'm not sure. Let me think again. The split operation for a linked list would take O(n) time because you have to traverse to the middle. So each level of recursion would involve splitting, which is O(n) each time, and since there are log n levels, the total time remains O(n log n). 

So both arrays and linked lists (singly and doubly) can be used with mergesort to achieve O(n log n) time. But wait, is that correct? Because I remember that in some implementations, linked lists might have some overhead, but in terms of time complexity, it's still O(n log n). 

Wait, but another point: when using a linked list, whether singly or doubly, the merge operation is more efficient in terms of space because you don't need extra arrays. But the time should still be the same asymptotically. 

So, all three data structures (singly linked list, doubly linked list, array) can be used with mergesort to get O(n log n) time. So the correct answer would be option D: I, II, and III.

Wait, but wait another thing. I'm a bit confused because I thought that linked lists are not as cache-efficient as arrays, but that's more about performance in practice rather than the theoretical time complexity. The question is about the big O notation, so cache efficiency doesn't matter here. 

So, the answer should include all three options. Let me look back at the options. Option D says I, II, and III. So the answer is D.

Mergesort is a sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach, splitting a list into halves, sorting each half recursively, and then merging the sorted halves. The question asks which data structures allow mergesort to work in \( O(n \log n) \) time. Let us analyze each option:

1. **Array (III):** Arrays allow random access, meaning elements can be accessed directly by their indices in \( O(1) \) time. Splitting an array into two halves is efficient, and merging two sorted arrays can also be done in \( O(n) \) time. Thus, mergesort runs in \( O(n \log n) \) time when using an array.

2. **Singly Linked List (I):** A singly linked list can be split into two halves by finding the midpoint using the slow and fast pointer technique, which takes \( O(n) \) time. Merging two sorted singly linked lists is also efficient, as it only involves adjusting pointers without requiring extra space. Therefore, mergesort can run in \( O(n \log n) \) time for a singly linked list.

3. **Doubly Linked List (II):** Similar to a singly linked list, a doubly linked list can be split into two halves in \( O(n) \) time. Merging two sorted doubly linked lists is also efficient, as the additional pointers in a doubly linked list do not affect the asymptotic time complexity. Thus, mergesort can run in \( O(n \log n) \) time for a doubly linked list as well.

In conclusion, all three data structures—arrays, singly linked lists, and doubly linked lists—allow mergesort to work in \( O(n \log n) \) time. The correct answer is:

D: I, II, and III
