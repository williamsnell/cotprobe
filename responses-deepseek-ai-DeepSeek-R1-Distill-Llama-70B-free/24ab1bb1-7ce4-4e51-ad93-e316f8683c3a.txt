Question:

A 64-year-old man with non-Hodgkin lymphoma comes to the physician because of a 3-week history of progressive numbness in his hands and feet and weakness in his legs when he stands. He received his third course of chemotherapy 4 weeks ago. Physical examination shows areflexia. Which of the following drugs is the most likely cause of these adverse effects?

Options:

A: Doxorubicin
B: Fluorouracil
C: Methotrexate
D: Vincristine

Okay, so I've got this question here about a 64-year-old man with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. He's been experiencing some symptoms for three weeks, like numbness in his hands and feet, and weakness in his legs when he stands. He finished his third round of chemotherapy four weeks ago. The physical exam shows areflexia, which means he has no reflexes. The question is asking which chemotherapy drug is most likely causing these side effects.

Hmm, I remember that chemotherapy drugs can have various side effects, especially on the nervous system. The symptoms he's having—numbness, weakness, areflexia—those seem like signs of nerve damage, maybe peripheral neuropathy. Which chemo drugs cause that?

Let me think about each option. 

Option A: Doxorubicin. I think Doxorubicin is an anthracycline, commonly used in various cancers. Its major side effect is cardiotoxicity, right? Like it can cause heart problems, leading to congestive heart failure. I don't recall it being a major cause of neuropathy. Maybe some, but not the worst offender.

Option B: Fluorouracil. Fluorouracil is a 5-FU drug, used mainly in colorectal cancer. Its side effects include mucositis, diarrhea, and hand-foot syndrome. I'm not sure about neuropathy being a big issue with this one. Maybe some, but I don't think it's the primary cause here.

Option C: Methotrexate. Methotrexate is an antimetabolite. It's used in various cancers and autoimmune diseases. Side effects often include liver toxicity, mucositis, and myelosuppression. I'm not too sure about neuropathy being a common side effect. Maybe in high doses or with certain administration routes, but I don't think it's the top choice here.

Option D: Vincristine. Oh wait, Vincristine is a vinca alkaloid. I remember that it's known for causing neurotoxicity. It affects the microtubules and can cause peripheral neuropathy. Symptoms like numbness, tingling, and muscle weakness are common. Also, areflexia makes sense because the nerves aren't conducting properly. So this seems like the most likely culprit.

Wait, let me double-check. The patient's symptoms started after the third course of chemo, which was four weeks ago. If the neuropathy is from vincristine, it often presents during or after treatment. The symptoms are progressive, which aligns with vincristine's side effects.

So putting it all together, the drug causing these effects is likely vincristine. The other options don't fit as well with the neuropathy symptoms described.

The patient is a 64-year-old man with non-Hodgkin lymphoma who developed progressive numbness in his hands and feet, weakness in his legs, and areflexia after his third course of chemotherapy. These symptoms suggest peripheral neuropathy, a known side effect of certain chemotherapy drugs.

- **Doxorubicin (A):** Primarily associated with cardiotoxicity, not neuropathy.
- **Fluorouracil (B):** Commonly causes mucositis, diarrhea, and hand-foot syndrome, but neuropathy is not a primary side effect.
- **Methotrexate (C):** More commonly associated with liver toxicity, mucositis, and myelosuppression; neuropathy is rare.
- **Vincristine (D):** A vinca alkaloid known for causing neurotoxicity, including peripheral neuropathy. Symptoms like numbness, weakness, and areflexia align with vincristine's side effect profile.

Given the symptoms and the drugs listed, vincristine is the most likely cause of the adverse effects.
