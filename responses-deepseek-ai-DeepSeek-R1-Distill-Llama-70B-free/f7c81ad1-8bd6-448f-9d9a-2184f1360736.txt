Question:

On March 1, a homeowner hired a landscaper to landscape his front yard. On March 25, as the landscaper was almost finished with the work on the front yard, the homeowner said to the landscaper, "I'm very pleased with your work to date. If you are willing, I would like you to landscape my backyard, on the same terms and conditions as our existing contract, the work to be completed by May 1. If you can meet that deadline, I'll pay you $10,000 at that time. " The landscaper replied, "Agreed. Let's shake hands on it. " They shook hands. What is the probable legal effect of the landscaper's promise on March 25 to landscape the backyard?

Okay, so I've got this question here about contract law, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see... The question is about a homeowner and a landscaper. They had an existing contract where the landscaper was hired to landscape the front yard, and then on March 25, they discussed adding the backyard.

Alright, the facts: On March 1, the contract was made for the front yard. Then on March 25, when the landscaper is almost done, the homeowner asks him to do the backyard too, same terms, to be done by May 1, and offers $10,000 upon completion. The landscaper agrees and they shake hands.

The question is about the legal effect of the landscaper's promise. The options are A through J, each suggesting a different outcome.

I remember that contract formation requires offer, acceptance, and consideration. So let's break it down.

First, the original contract was for the front yard. Now, the homeowner is making a new offer to the landscaper to do the backyard on the same terms. The landscaper agreed by saying "Agreed. Let's shake hands." So that's an acceptance.

Wait, but what about consideration? The original contract's terms were probably based on the front yard work. Now, for the backyard, the homeowner is offering an additional $10,000. So that might be the consideration for the new promise. But wait, the original contract's consideration was probably payment for the front yard work. Now, the new offer is to pay $10k for the backyard. So each party is giving something new.

But wait, sometimes when modifying contracts, the pre-existing duty rule comes into play. If the original contract already required the landscaper to do certain work, and now they're adding more work, that's a separate agreement. So the new promise to do the backyard is a new contract, not a modification of the old one. Because the backyard wasn't part of the original agreement.

So, in this case, the homeowner is offering to pay $10k for the backyard work, which the landscaper wasn't previously obligated to do. So that's valid consideration. The offer is from the homeowner, the acceptance is the landscaper's agreement. So a bilateral contract is formed when both parties exchange promises. Here, the landscaper is promising to do the work, and the homeowner is promising to pay.

Wait, so the offer was to do the work on the same terms, which I think refers to the payment terms as the original contract. So maybe the terms include payment upon completion. So the new contract is for the backyard, with the same payment terms as the front yard. But the front yard's payment was probably upon completion, so here the homeowner is offering $10k upon completion by May 1.

So the offer is from the homeowner: if you do the backyard by May 1, I'll pay you $10k. The landscaper accepts by agreeing. So that's a valid contract.

Looking at the options:

A: Enforceable bilateral contract. That's possible because both parties are making promises.

B: Breach of original contract? No, because this is an additional work, not a breach.

C: Unilateral contract. Unilateral requires only one promise, like a reward where only the action is needed, not a promise. Here, both are promising, so it's bilateral.

D: Down payment needed. The question doesn't mention any, so I don't think that's an issue.

E: Enforceable only if work done by deadline. Well, contracts are enforceable when made; the condition is about when payment happens. But the contract exists regardless of whether the work is done on time.

F: Duress? No indication of that.

G: Illusory promise. The promise isn't illusory because the landscaper is bound to perform; they agreed to do it by May 1.

H: Quasi-contract. That's for when there's no actual contract but someone is unjustly enriched. Not the case here.

I: Voidable because no writing. For contracts that need to be in writing under the statute of frauds, like contracts that can't be performed within a year. The original front yard contract started on March 1, and this new contract is to be completed by May 1, which is within a year, so the statute of frauds doesn't apply. So it doesn't need to be in writing.

J: Lack of consideration. No, because each is giving something new. The $10k is consideration for the backyard work.

So the correct answer should be A: Enforceable bilateral contract.

Wait, but let me double-check. The original contract's consideration was for the front yard. The new agreement is for the backyard. So each party is making a new promise. The homeowner's offer to pay $10k is new consideration, and the landscaper's promise to do the backyard is also new consideration. So yes, it's a valid contract, bilateral because both made promises.

The scenario involves a homeowner and a landscaper who initially entered into a contract for landscaping the front yard on March 1. On March 25, the homeowner offered to hire the landscaper to landscape the backyard on the same terms as the original contract, with a deadline of May 1 and payment of $10,000 upon completion. The landscaper accepted the offer, and they shook hands.

To determine the legal effect of the landscaper's promise, we analyze the elements of contract formation: offer, acceptance, and consideration. The homeowner made a new offer for the backyard work, which the landscaper accepted by agreeing to the terms. This creates a new contract distinct from the original front yard contract. The consideration for this new contract is the homeowner's promise to pay $10,000 and the landscaper's promise to perform the backyard work. 

This is a bilateral contract because both parties exchanged promises. The contract is enforceable as it meets all necessary legal requirements, including consideration. There is no indication of issues such as duress, illusory promises, or the need for a written agreement under the statute of frauds, as the work is to be completed within a year.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Correct. The landscaper's promise created an enforceable bilateral contract with valid consideration.
- **B**: Incorrect. There was no breach of the original contract; this was a new agreement.
- **C**: Incorrect. This is not a unilateral contract, as both parties made promises.
- **D**: Incorrect. No down payment was required for enforceability.
- **E**: Incorrect. The contract is enforceable upon formation, regardless of whether the deadline is met.
- **F**: Incorrect. There was no duress.
- **G**: Incorrect. The promise was not illusory, as the landscaper was obligated to perform.
- **H**: Incorrect. This is not a quasi-contract situation.
- **I**: Incorrect. The contract does not require a written agreement under the statute of frauds.
- **J**: Incorrect. There was valid consideration from both parties.

The correct answer is:

**A: The landscaper's promise created an enforceable bilateral contract.**
