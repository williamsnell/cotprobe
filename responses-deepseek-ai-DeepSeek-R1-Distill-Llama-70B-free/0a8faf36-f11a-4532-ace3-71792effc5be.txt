Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about NO reduction in exhaust gases. Hmm, let's see what the question is asking. 

The problem has two parts, (i) and (ii). I'll need to find the minimum allowable delta (δ) and the corresponding K value. The given data includes the exhaust gases' temperature (1200°F), pressure (18.2 psia), average molecular weight (30.0), effective rate constant K (760 ft/hr), and diffusion coefficient D₁m (4.0 ft²/hr). Oh wait, but wait, the options list K values much lower than 760, so maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh, maybe the given K is the effective rate constant, and I'm supposed to find the minimum allowable K. Or perhaps it's part of the calculation.

The exhaust gases contain 0.22% NO by weight. The required NO reduction rate is 0.032 lb/ft²hr. I'm a bit confused about what formulas to use here. 

I remember that in catalytic reactions, the rate might be limited by either chemical kinetics or mass transfer (diffusion). The rate is the minimum of the two possible rates: the intrinsic kinetic rate and the mass transfer limited rate. So the overall rate would be controlled by whichever is slower.

The intrinsic rate, I think, depends on the concentration and the rate constant K, but the mass transfer rate depends on diffusion. So the overall reaction rate is the smaller of the two.

The formula for the mass transfer limited rate (assuming it's first order?) might be something like (D * (P / (R*T))) * (w) ... Wait, wait. Let me think. 

The molar flux (mol/(cm²·s)) for mass transfer is often given by J = (D/δ) * (C_s - C_b), where δ is the thickness of the boundary layer, D is the diffusion coefficient, C_s is the surface concentration, and C_b is the bulk concentration. But in this case, perhaps the mass transfer rate is (D/δ) times the concentration difference. But I'm not sure about the exact expression here.

Wait, another approach. The rate of reaction per unit area, R, could be given by the minimum of two rates: R = min(k * C, (D/δ) * C), where k is the reaction rate constant and D/δ is the mass transfer coefficient. So, if R is limited by the slower process.

But I'm not entirely sure about that. Alternatively, the rate might be given by the product of the mass transfer coefficient and the concentration. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the rate (mass per unit area per unit time) is R = (D/δ) * (C), where C is the concentration of NO in the bulk. So, the mass transfer rate is (D/δ) * C, and the kinetic rate is K * C. The actual rate is the smaller of these two. But to achieve a certain rate (like 0.032 lb/ft²hr), the rate should be greater than or equal to that. So the minimum δ would be when the mass transfer rate equals the required rate.

So, let's set R = (D/δ) * C = 0.032 lb/ft²hr.

But wait, I need to compute C, the concentration of NO in the bulk in lb/ft³. 

The gases are at T=1200°F, which I should convert to absolute temperature. 1200°F is (1200 - 459.67) = 740.33 R. 

The pressure is 18.2 psia. The ideal gas law is PV = nRT, so the molar concentration would be (P)/(RT). 

But the molecular weight is given as 30.0, which I can use to find the density, which is (P * M) / (R*T), where R is the gas constant in appropriate units.

Wait, let me compute the density first. The gas constant R is 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lb·mol·R). Or wait, maybe better to use R as 0.7302 ft·psi/(R·lb_mol). Hmm, perhaps I should double-check the units.

Alternatively, the density ρ is (P * M) / (R*T). Let me make sure about the units. 

P is in psia, M is lb/mol. R is in (psi·ft³)/(lb·mol·R). So the units:

[ R ] = psi·ft³/(lb_mol·R)
[ P ] = psi
[ M ] = lb_mol/lb_mol? No, M is 30 lb/lb_mol. Wait no, M is 30 g/mol? No, molecular weight is 30 lb/lb_mol. 

Wait, perhaps better to work with R = 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lb·mol·R). So:

Density ρ = (P * M) / (R*T)

Plugging in the numbers: P=18.2 psia, M=30 lb/lbmol, R=10.7316, T=1200°F = 740.33 R.

So:

ρ = (18.2 * 30) / (10.7316 * 740.33)
Let me compute the denominator first: 10.7316 * 740.33 ≈ let's see, 10 * 740 is 7400, 0.7316 *740 is approx 540. So total approx 7940. So 18.2 *30 = 546. 546 / 7940 ≈ 0.0688 lb/ft³.

Wait, let me compute more accurately:

10.7316 * 740.33 = let's compute:

10 * 740.33 = 7403.3
0.7316 *740.33 ≈ 0.7 *740=518, 0.0316*740≈23.34 → 518+23.34=541.34 → total 7403.3 +541.34=7944.64.

So, 18.2 *30 = 546. So ρ=546 / 7944.64 ≈ 0.0687 lb/ft³.

Wait, but the NO is 0.22% by weight. So the concentration of NO is 0.22% of the total density.

So C_NO = 0.0022 * ρ = 0.0022 * 0.0687 ≈ 0.000151 lb/ft³.

Wait, no. Wait, 0.22% is 0.0022. So 0.0022 * 0.0687 lb/ft³ = 0.00015114 lb/ft³.

So R = (D / δ) * C_NO = (4.0 ft²/hr / δ ft) ) * 0.00015114 lb/ft³.

Because D is in ft²/hr, δ is in ft. So (D/δ) is 1/hr.

R has units of lb/(ft²·hr) because it's per unit area and per unit time.

So:

R = (4.0 / δ) * 0.00015114 = 0.032 lb/ft²hr.

So set this equal to 0.032:

(4.0 * 0.00015114) / δ = 0.032 → (0.00060456) / δ = 0.032 → δ = 0.00060456 / 0.032.

Calculate that: 0.00060456 / 0.032 → 604.56e-6 / 32e-3 → (604.56 / 32) * 1e-3 → approx 18.89 * 1e-3 → 0.01889 ft. Wait, that's about 0.0189 ft, which is 0.2268 inches. But looking at the options, the smallest δ is 0.0018 ft (option H), which is 0.0216 inches. Hmm, none of the options have δ around 0.0189 ft. So maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Maybe the rate is (D/δ) * (C), but perhaps the correct concentration is molar concentration, or perhaps I should have considered the molar mass.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is R = (D/δ) * (P_NO / (R*T)) * M_NO. Hmm. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach. The molar concentration of NO is (P * y_NO) / (R*T), where y_NO is the mole fraction. Since NO is 0.22% by weight, I need to find its mole fraction.

But this might be more complicated. Let me see. The total mass is 100 units, 0.22 units are NO, and the rest is other gases. The molecular weight of NO is 30 g/mol, same as the average molecular weight of the exhaust gases (30). Oh, wait, the average molecular weight is 30.0, same as NO's molecular weight. So the mole fraction would be same as the mass fraction. Because for ideal gases with same molecular weight, mass fraction equals mole fraction. So y_NO = 0.0022.

So the molar concentration (n/V) is (P * y_NO) / (R*T). 

But wait, R should be in appropriate units. Let's use R as 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lb·mol·R).

So n/V = (18.2 psi * 0.0022) / (10.7316 * 740.33 R) → Let's compute this.

18.2 *0.0022=0.04004.

Denominator: 10.7316 *740.33 ≈ 7944.64 as before.

So n/V ≈ 0.04004 / 7944.64 ≈ 5.044e-6 lb·mol/ft³.

Wait, but wait, NO's molar concentration would be 5.044e-6 lb·mol/ft³. The molar mass of NO is 30 lb/lb·mol, so the mass concentration is 5.044e-6 *30 = 0.0001513 lb/ft³, which matches what I got before. So C_NO is 0.0001513 lb/ft³.

So using that, R = (D/δ) * C_NO = (4.0 / δ) * 0.0001513 = 0.032.

So (4 * 0.0001513) / δ = 0.032 → 0.0006052 / δ = 0.032 → δ = 0.0006052 / 0.032 → 0.0189 ft. Hmm, that's not matching any of the options. So maybe I messed up the formula.

Another thought: perhaps I should use the mass transfer coefficient, which is (D/δ), but maybe the rate is (D/δ) * (C_s - C_surface). Wait, but if the surface concentration is zero (because the reaction is so fast that it consumes all NO at the surface), then the rate would be (D/δ) * C_s, where C_s is the surface concentration. But this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the rate is (D/δ) * (P_NO) / (R*T) ), but I'm not sure.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the rate is calculated using the diffusion equation, considering the flux. The molar flux J is (D/δ) * (C_bulk - C_surface). If the reaction is fast, C_surface is zero, so J = (D/δ) * C_bulk.

Then the mass flux would be J * M_NO, where M_NO is molar mass. So R = J * M_NO = (D/δ) * C_bulk * M_NO.

Wait, let me compute that again. C_bulk is in lb·mol/ft³. M_NO is lb per lb·mol, so J is lb/(ft²·hr). So R would be (D/δ) * C_bulk * M_NO.

So let's compute C_bulk: as before, 0.04004 / 7944.64 = 5.044e-6 lb·mol/ft³.

M_NO is 30 lb/lb·mol.

So R = (4.0/δ) * 5.044e-6 *30 → (4.0/δ) * 1.513e-4.

So R = (4 * 1.513e-4) / δ = (6.052e-4) / δ.

Set R = 0.032 lb/ft²hr.

So 6.052e-4 / δ = 0.032 → δ = 6.052e-4 / 0.032 → 0.0189 ft. Same result as before.

Hmm, again, this doesn't match any of the options. So perhaps I'm using the wrong approach.

Wait, maybe the concentration should be in lb/ft³, and the rate is (D/δ) * C. So with C=0.0001513 lb/ft³, D=4 ft²/hr, then (4/δ)*0.0001513 = 0.032. So 0.0006052/δ = 0.032 → δ = 0.0006052/0.032 → 0.0189 ft, which is 0.0189 ft, but the options don't have this.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option D: δ=0.0032 ft, K=47

Option G: δ=0.0032, K=50

Option I: δ=0.0026, K=47

Hmm, none match 0.0189. So I must be making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Let me think again.

Another approach: perhaps the rate is given by K * C, where K is the effective rate constant, which is given as 760 ft/hr. Wait, but the question is to find the minimum δ and K. Hmm, maybe the effective rate is the minimum of the kinetic rate and the mass transfer rate.

Wait, the effective rate constant K_eff is given by 1/(1/K + δ/(D * K)) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the overall rate is (K * D/(K + D/δ)) ... No, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, maybe the rate is (K * C) for the kinetic limit, and (D/δ)*C for the diffusion limit. The actual rate is the minimum of these two. So for the rate to be 0.032, both must be >=0.032. But to find the minimum δ, we can set the diffusion-limited rate to exactly 0.032.

So, (D/δ)*C = 0.032. Which is what I did before, but giving δ=0.0189 ft, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the concentration in a different way. Maybe I should use partial pressure instead. Let me try that.

Partial pressure of NO: P_NO = y_NO * P_total = 0.0022 * 18.2 psia = 0.04004 psia.

The molar concentration, C_NO (lb·mol/ft³) = P_NO / (R*T). Again, R=10.7316 psi·ft³/(lb·mol·R), T=1200°F=740.33 R.

So C_NO = 0.04004 / (10.7316 *740.33) → same as before, 5.044e-6 lb·mol/ft³.

So same result. So perhaps my approach is correct, but the options don't match. Alternatively, perhaps I have a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the rate is (D/δ) * (P_NO / (R*T)) * M_NO. Let's compute that.

P_NO = 0.04004 psi. R=10.7316 psi·ft³/(lb·mol·R). T=740.33 R.

M_NO=30 lb/lb·mol.

So (D/δ) * (P_NO/(R*T)) * M_NO = (4/δ) * (0.04004/(10.7316*740.33)) *30.

Compute denominator: 10.7316 *740.33 ≈7944.64.

0.04004 /7944.64 ≈5.044e-6.

Multiply by 30: 1.513e-4.

So (4/δ) * 1.513e-4 = 0.032.

So 6.052e-4 / δ =0.032 → δ=6.052e-4 /0.032=0.0189 ft.

Same result. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the question has a typo, or I misread it. Let me check the given data again.

The problem says the exhaust gases contain 0.22% NO by weight. So that's 0.22% by mass, which we've correctly converted.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the rate in lb/(ft²·hr), and the correct formula is (D/δ) * (C), but perhaps the concentration is in lb-mol/ft³, which when multiplied by D (ft²/hr) and divided by δ (ft), gives lb-mol/(ft·hr), and then multiplied by molecular weight (lb/lb-mol) gives lb/(ft·hr). Then, per ft², it's lb/(ft²·hr). So perhaps I did it correctly.

But then my answer is 0.0189 ft, which isn't in the options. So perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, let me recheck the calculation steps.

Compute density: (18.2 *30)/(10.7316 *740.33) → 546 /7944.64 → 0.0687 lb/ft³.

NO concentration: 0.22% of that: 0.0687 *0.0022=0.00015114 lb/ft³.

Then R= (4/δ) * 0.00015114 =0.032.

So 4 *0.00015114 =0.00060456.

0.00060456 / δ =0.032 → δ=0.00060456 /0.032=0.0189 ft.

Hmm, that's 0.0189 ft, which is 0.2268 inches. But the options have δ in the range of 0.0018 to 0.0050 ft. So 0.0189 is much larger. So perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the rate is (K * C), where K is the effective rate constant given as 760 ft/hr. Wait, but the question is asking for the minimum δ and the corresponding K. So
