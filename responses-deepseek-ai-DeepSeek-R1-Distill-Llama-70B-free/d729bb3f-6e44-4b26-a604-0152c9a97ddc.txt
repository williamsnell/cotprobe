Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields and charged cylindrical shells. Hmm. Let me try to think through this step by step.

Alright, the setup: there are two concentric cylindrical shells. The inner one has a radius of 3.0 cm, and the outer is 6.0 cm. Both are charged. The charge per unit length on the inner shell is 5.0e-6 C/m, and on the outer it's -7.0e-6 C/m. I need to find the electric field magnitude E at a radial distance of 4.0 cm.

Wait, right. So 4 cm is between the two shells since the inner is 3 cm and the outer 6 cm. So the point where we're measuring is in between the two cylinders.

I remember that for cylindrical shells, the electric field inside a conducting shell is zero. But wait, these are thin-walled shells, so they're more like charged surfaces. Oh, right, Gauss's Law applies here.

Gauss's Law says that the electric flux through a Gaussian surface is equal to the enclosed charge divided by epsilon_0. So the electric field depends on the charge enclosed.

Since the point is at 4 cm, which is outside the inner cylinder but inside the outer one. So the Gaussian surface would be a cylinder with radius 4 cm. The enclosed charge would be just the charge on the inner cylinder because the outer shell's charge is outside the Gaussian surface and doesn't contribute.

Wait, wait. So to clarify: the inner cylinder has charge per unit length λ1 =5e-6 C/m, and the outer has λ2 = -7e-6 C/m. But when I take a Gaussian surface of r=4 cm, it's larger than the inner radius (3 cm) but smaller than the outer (6 cm). So the enclosed charge is just that on the inner cylinder.

So the electric field at 4 cm would be due to the inner cylinder's charge only. Because the charges on the outer cylinder would reside on the outer surface, so inside the outer cylinder (like at 4 cm), the outer cylinder's charge doesn't contribute. Wait no, no. The outer cylinder's charge is on its surface, which is at 6 cm. So at 4 cm, which is inside the outer cylinder, the charge enclosed is just the inner cylinder's charge.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because the outer cylinder has a charge, but since the point is inside the outer cylinder, the outer cylinder's charge would contribute? Or not?

Wait, think again. For a cylindrical shell, the electric field inside the cylinder (r less than its radius) is zero, and outside (r greater than radius) is as if all the charge were a line charge along the axis.

So in this setup, the Gaussian surface at 4 cm encloses the inner cylinder's charge but not the outer's. Because the outer cylinder's charge is at 6 cm, so our Gaussian surface (r=4) is inside the outer cylinder. So the outer cylinder's charge doesn't contribute to the field at this point.

Wait no, that's the opposite. Wait, if you have a charged cylindrical shell, inside it (r less than its radius), the field is zero. Outside, the field behaves as if all the charge is a line along the axis.

So the outer cylinder has a radius of 6 cm. So at r=4 cm, which is less than 6 cm, we are inside the outer cylinder. Therefore, the field due to the outer cylinder at r=4 cm is zero. So the only contribution comes from the inner cylinder.

Wait, but the outer cylinder has a charge of -7e-6 C/m. Okay, but since we're inside that cylinder, the field from it is zero. So the total field at 4 cm is just due to the inner cylinder.

So the electric field E is calculated using the formula for a line charge: E = (λ_enclosed) / (2 * pi * epsilon_0 * r) ), where r is the radial distance from the axis, and λ_enclosed is the charge per unit length inside the Gaussian surface.

In this case, λ_enclosed is just λ1, which is 5e-6 C/m.

So plugging in the numbers:

E = (5e-6 C/m) / (2 * pi * epsilon_0 * 0.04 m )

Wait, wait. Wait, the radius is 4 cm, so 0.04 meters.

Epsilon_0 is 8.85e-12 C²/(N·m²).

Let me compute this step by step.

Compute denominator first: 2 * pi * epsilon_0 * r.

2 * pi is about 6.2832.

r is 0.04 m.

So denominator = 6.2832 * 8.85e-12 * 0.04.

Let me calculate that:

6.2832 * 0.04 = 0.251328.

0.251328 * 8.85e-12 = 0.251328 * 8.85e-12.

Let me compute 0.251328 * 8.85.

0.251328 *8=2.010624, 0.251328 *0.85=0.213411. So total 2.010624+0.213411=2.224035.

So denominator is 2.224035e-12.

Wait, wait, 0.251328 *8.85e-12 = (0.251328 *8.85) * 1e-12.

Which would be 2.224035e-12. So denominator is 2.224035e-12.

Wait wait, no:

Wait, 2*pi*epsilon_0*r is 6.2832 * 8.85e-12 * 0.04.

So that's 6.2832 * 0.04 = 0.251328; then 0.251328 * 8.85e-12 = (0.251328 *8.85 )e-12.

0.251328 *8 = 2.010624, 0.251328 *0.85=0.2134116. So 2.010624 +0.2134116=2.2240356. So 2.2240356e-12.

So denominator is 2.2240356e-12 C²/(N·m²·m) ?

Hmm.

Numerator is 5e-6 C/m.

So E is (5e-6) / (2.2240356e-12) ) N/C.

Wait, let me compute that.

5e-6 / 2.2240356e-12 = (5 / 2.2240356) ) * 1e6.

5 / 2.2240356 is approximately 2.247. So 2.247e6 N/C.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: 3e6

Option B:4.5e6

Option E: 2.9e6

Hmm, none of these match exactly. Wait, did I make a mistake in calculations?

Wait, let me recheck the numbers.

Wait, 5e-6 / (2 * pi * epsilon_0 * 0.04 )

Compute denominator:

2 * pi = 6.283185307

epsilon_0 = 8.8541878128e-12 F/m (C²/(N·m²)).

r is 0.04 meters.

So denominator is 6.283185307 * 8.8541878128e-12 * 0.04.

Let me compute that.

6.283185307 * 0.04 = 0.2513272143.

Multiply by 8.8541878128e-12:

0.2513272143 * 8.8541878128e-12 = ?

Compute 0.2513272143 * 8.8541878128 first.

Let me calculate that:

Approximately:

0.25 *8.85 = 2.2125, and 0.001327... *8.85 is about 0.0117.

So total approx 2.2242.

So 2.2242e-12.

So denominator is 2.2242e-12.

So E = 5e-6 / 2.2242e-12.

5e-6 is 5,000,000e-12 * 1e-6? Wait, no: 5e-6 is 5*1e-6, which is 5,000,000e-12? Wait, 1e-6 is 1e-6 = 0.000001. 5e-6 is 0.000005.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute 5e-6 / 2.2242e-12.

5e-6 is 5 * 1e-6.

2.2242e-12 is 2.2242 * 1e-12.

So 5e-6 / 2.2242e-12 = (5 / 2.2242) * 1e6.

Because (1e-6)/(1e-12) )= 1e6.

5 / 2.2242 is approximately 2.247.

So 2.247e6 N/C.

Looking at the options, the closest is E: 2.9e6 or I:2e6 or F:2.3e6.

Wait, was my calculation correct? Let me check.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Compute 5 / 2.2240356.

2.2240356 times 2 is 4.448, which is less than 5. So 2.2240356 * 2.247 = ?

2.2240356 * 2 =4.4480712.

2.2240356 *0.247 → let's compute 0.2 * 2.2240356 = 0.44480712.

0.04 *2.2240356 = 0.088961424.

0.007 *2.2240356= 0.015568249.

Adding those: 0.44480712 + 0.088961424 = 0.53376854 + 0.015568249=0.549336789.

So 0.247 *2.2240356 = approximately 0.549336789.

So 2.2240356 * 2.247 ≈ 4.4480712 + 0.549336789=4.99740799, which is about 5. So 2.247 would give us approximately 5, so 5 / 2.2240356 ≈2.247.

Thus E≈2.247e6 N/C.

Looking at the options, option E is 2.9e6, option I is 2.0e6, option F is 2.3e6, option H is1.8e6, and option D is 1.2e6.

Hmm, none of these exactly match. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should compute 5e-6 / (2*pi*epsilon_0 *0.04).

Let me calculate 2*pi*epsilon_0*0.04:

2 * pi ≈6.28319.

epsilon_0≈8.8541878e-12.

r=0.04 m.

So denominator = 6.28319 * 8.8541878e-12 *0.04.

Compute 6.28319 * 0.04 = 0.2513276.

Multiply by 8.8541878e-12:

0.2513276 *8.8541878e-12 = ?

Let me compute 0.2513276 *8.8541878 = 

0.2 *8.8541878=1.77083756.

0.05 *8.8541878=0.44270939.

0.0013276 *8.8541878≈0.011743.

So sum: 1.77083756 +0.44270939=2.21354695 +0.011743=2.22529 approx.

So denominator is 2.22529e-12.

So E = 5e-6 / 2.22529e-12 = (5 / 2.22529) )e6.

5 /2.22529 is approximately 2.247.

Wait, so E≈2.247e6 N/C.

Looking at the options, the closest is option F: 2.3e6 or option I:2e6.

But wait, the options don't have 2.247e6. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, wait a second. Another possibility: maybe I should consider the superposition of the electric fields from both shells?

Wait, no, because the outer shell's charge doesn't contribute inside itself. So the field at 4 cm is only due to the inner shell.

Wait, but let me think again. The outer shell has a charge of -7e-6 C/m. So when you're inside the outer shell (r=4 cm <6 cm), the field from the outer shell is zero. Only the inner shell contributes.

So the calculation should be as I did before.

Hmm, but maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Wait, the formula for E due to a line charge is E = (lambda) / (2 pi epsilon_0 r).

Wait, units: lambda is C/m. E is N/C.

Let me compute using constants accurately.

Compute denominator: 2 * pi * epsilon_0 * r.

epsilon_0 = 8.8541878e-12 F/m.

2*pi =6.283185307.

r=0.04 m.

So denominator =6.283185307 *8.8541878e-12 *0.04.

Compute 6.283185307 *0.04=0.2513272143.

Then multiply by 8.8541878e-12:

0.2513272143 *8.8541878e-12 = ?

Compute 0.2513272143 *8.8541878.

Let me compute this accurately.

0.2513272143 *8 =2.010617712.

0.2513272143 *.8541878.

Compute 0.2513272143 *0.8=0.2010617714.

0.2513272143 *0.0541878= approximately 0.013616.

So 0.2010617714 +0.013616 =0.2146777714.

So total 2.010617712 +0.2146777714=2.225295483.

So denominator is 2.225295483e-12.

E = 5e-6 / 2.225295483e-12.

5e-6 is 5 *1e-6 = 5e-6.

So 5e-6 / 2.225295483e-12 = (5 / 2.225295483) ) *1e6.

Compute 5/2.225295483.

2.225295483 *2=4.450590966, which is less than 5. So 5/2.225295483 ≈2.247.

So E≈2.247e6 N/C.

Looking at the options, the closest is option F:2.3e6 or option I:2.0e6.

Wait, but perhaps the exact value is 5e-6 / (2 pi epsilon_0 * 0.04).

Let me compute 2*pi*epsilon_0 *0.04:

2 pi is 6.283185307.

epsilon_0 is 8.8541878e-12.

Multiply all together:

6.283185307 * 8.8541878e-12 = let's compute 6.283185307 *8.8541878 first.

6 *8.8541878 =53.1251268.

0.283185307 *8.8541878 ≈2.506.

So total ≈53.1251268 +2.506 =55.6311.

Wait, no, wait. That's 6.283185307 *8.8541878 → 6 *8.8541878=53.1251268, 0.283185307 *8.8541878≈2.506. So approx 55.631e-12.

Then 55.631e-12 *0.04 = 2.22524e-12.

So E=5e-6 / 2.22524e-12 = approx 2.247e6 N/C.

Hmm, none of the options exactly match this. Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A:3.0e6

B:4.5e6

C:0

D:1.2e6

E:2.9e6

F:2.3e6

G:3.6e6

H:1.8e6

I:2.0e6

J:5.2e6

So 2.247 is closest to option F:2.3e6. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation earlier.

Wait, let me compute 5 / 2.22524.

2.22524 * 2 =4.45048.

So 5-4.45048=0.54952.

So 0.54952 /2.22524 = approx 0.54952 /2.22524 ≈0.247.

So 2.247, which is 2.247e6. So the answer is approximately 2.25e6, which is 2.3e6 when rounded to two significant figures.

Wait, the given charges are 5.0e-6 and 7.0e-6, two significant figures each. So the answer should also have two significant figures.

2.247 rounds to 2.2e6 or 2.3e6. So 2.3e6 would be option F.

But let's see, is option F 2.3e6?

Yes, option F is 2.3e6.

So the correct answer should be F.

Wait, but wait. Oh, wait a second. Another thought: perhaps the outer shell's charge affects the field?

Wait, no, because the field inside a conducting shell is zero. So the outer shell's charge contributes nothing at r=4 cm.

Wait, but wait, the outer shell has a charge of -7e-6 C/m. So if it's a conducting shell, the charges reside on its outer surface. So the inner surface would have induced charges, but in this case, since the inner cylinder has a charge, perhaps there's an induced charge on the inner surface of the outer cylinder.

Wait, but wait, the inner cylinder has charge per unit length +5
