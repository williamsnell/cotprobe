Okay, so I've got this question about plant embryogenesis, and I'm a bit new to the topic. Let me try to break it down. The question is asking which statement is incorrect among the given options.

Alright, the options are A through D. Let's go one by one.

Option A: The suspensor is derived from the basal cell. Hmm, I remember that after fertilization, the zygote divides to form two cells: an apical cell and a basal cell. The apical cell goes on to form the embryo, while the basal cell develops into the suspensor. So A sounds correct. So A isn't the wrong statement.

Option B: Cotyledons are derived from the apical cell. Right, the apical cell becomes the embryo proper. The embryo has parts like the radicle, hypocotyl, and the cotyledons. So the cotyledons, which are the seed leaves, come from the apical cell. So B is correct, so not the wrong one.

Option C: Shoot apical meristem formation occurs after seed formation. Wait, the shoot apical meristem is part of the embryo. During embryogenesis, the meristems (like shoot and root) form. So by the time the seed is formed, the meristems are already there. So if C says that shoot apical meristem forms after seed formation, that would be incorrect. Because the shoot meristem is formed during embryogenesis, which is before the seed is mature. So C might be the incorrect statement.

Option D: Precursors of all three plant tissue systems are formed during embryogenesis. The three tissue systems are dermal, vascular, and ground. During embryogenesis, the procambium (precursor to vascular tissue) forms, and other tissues start developing. So yes, all three are initiated then. So D is correct.

So the incorrect statement is C. Because the shoot apical meristem is formed during embryogenesis, not after the seed is formed.

The question asks which statement about plant embryogenesis is incorrect. Here's the analysis of each option:

- **Option A**: The suspensor is derived from the basal cell. This is correct because, after fertilization, the zygote divides into an apical cell (which forms the embryo) and a basal cell (which forms the suspensor).

- **Option B**: Cotyledons are derived from the apical cell. This is correct because the apical cell gives rise to the embryo proper, including structures like the cotyledons (seed leaves).

- **Option C**: Shoot apical meristem formation occurs after seed formation. This is incorrect because the shoot apical meristem forms during embryogenesis, which takes place before the seed is fully formed.

- **Option D**: Precursors of all three plant tissue systems are formed during embryogenesis. This is correct because the precursors of the dermal, vascular, and ground tissue systems are established during embryogenesis.

The incorrect statement is **C**, as the shoot apical meristem forms during embryogenesis, not after seed formation.

Answer: C
