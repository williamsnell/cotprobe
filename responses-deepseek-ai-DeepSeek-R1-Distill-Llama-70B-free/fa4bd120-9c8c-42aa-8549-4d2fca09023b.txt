Okay, so I'm looking at this question about wills and estates. Let's try to break it down step by step. 

Mary is a wealthy widow from St. Petersburg. She made her first and only will on May 15, 1990, and died on August 18, 1990. The will says her estate should be divided equally between her only child, Joan, and the Salvation Army of Largo. The question is asking how the estate will actually be distributed.

Hmm, so I remember that when a person dies, their will dictates how their estate is distributed, assuming everything is valid. But wait, are there any exceptions here? Like, could Joan challenge the will or is there any rule that might automatically give her a certain share regardless of the will?

I think about the concept of "pretermitted heirs." If a will was made before a child was born, and the child isn't mentioned in the will, they might be entitled to a share. But in this case, Mary's only child is Joan, and the will was made on May 15, 1990. Joan was already her child at that time, right? So the pretermitted heir statute probably doesn't apply here because Joan was already around when the will was made. Unless Joan was born after the will, but the question doesn't say that. So Mary included Joan in the will, so the pretermitted heir rules wouldn't give Joan a bigger share.

Another thought: elective share. I remember that in some jurisdictions, a surviving spouse can choose to take a certain percentage of the estate regardless of the will. But wait, Mary is a widow, so her spouse is deceased. So that rule doesn't apply here. So Joan isn't a spouse but the child. Is there an elective share for children? I think some states allow children to take against the will for a certain share, but I'm not sure. Or maybe Florida has specific rules about this.

Wait, the question says Mary is from St. Petersburg, which is in Florida. So I need to think about Florida's laws. Florida has an elective share statute, but I think it applies to spouses, not children. So Joan, as a child, can't claim an elective share. So the will's distribution should stand unless there's another issue.

So the will divides the estate equally between Joan and the Salvation Army. So each gets 50%. But looking at the options, some suggest trusts or life estates, but the question says the estate is divided equally. So unless there's a legal reason to overturn that, it should be 50-50.

Wait, but another point: the Salvation Army is a charity. I don't think charities can take under a will if there's a legal issue, but I don't see any problem here. Also, in Florida, if a beneficiary is a charity and the will is valid, they can take their share.

Looking at the options, option F says 50% to Joan and 50% to Salvation Army. Option B says the same but Joan can opt out. I don't think Joan can reject her share; the will's distribution stands unless she challenges it, but the question doesn't say she's doing that. So the default is that the estate is divided equally as per the will.

Wait, but option D says 100% to Joan if she files a petition to avoid the Salvation Army's devise. How would that happen? If there's a way for Joan to set aside the will's provision to the Salvation Army. But under what grounds? Maybe if the will wasn't properly executed, but the question says it was Mary's first and only will, executed on May 15, and she died in August. So presumably, the will is valid. Unless Joan can argue undue influence or something, but the question doesn't mention any such issues.

So without any challenges, the estate is split 50-50. So the correct answer would be F.

Mary, a wealthy widow from St. Petersburg, executed her will on May 15, 1990, and died on August 18, 1990. Her will provided for her estate to be divided equally between her only child, Joan, and the Salvation Army of Largo. The question asks how the estate will be distributed.

Under Florida law, the validity of the will is presumed since it was properly executed, and there is no indication of any challenges to its validity, such as undue influence or lack of capacity. The pretermitted heir statute does not apply because Joan was already born when the will was made, and Mary included Joan as a beneficiary. Additionally, Florida's elective share statute applies to spouses, not children, so Joan cannot claim a larger share under that law.

The will explicitly divides the estate equally between Joan and the Salvation Army, and there is no legal basis to alter this distribution. Therefore, the estate will be divided 50% to Joan and 50% to the Salvation Army, as stated in the will.

The correct answer is:

F: 50% to Joan and 50% to the Salvation Army.

Answer: F
