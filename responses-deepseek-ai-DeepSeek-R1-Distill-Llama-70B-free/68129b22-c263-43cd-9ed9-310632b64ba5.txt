Question:

To improve the quality of rental housing within its boundaries, a city proposed an ordinance requiring all new and existing rental housing units to provide at least one full bathroom for each bedroom, plumbing and electrical hookups for a washer and dryer, and a covered parking space. A majority of the owners of existing rental housing in the city opposed the ordinance. They argued that it would dramatically decrease the number of lowincome rental housing units because owners would be unable to raise rents enough to recoup the investment required to comply. Without denying these contentions, the city enacted the ordinance. A plaintiff who owns low-income rental housing has sued the city, claiming only that the ordinance is unconstitutional on its face. Which of the following best states the burden of persuasion in this action?

Options:

A: The city must demonstrate that the ordinance is necessary to serve a compelling state interest, because it adversely affects the fundamental right of rental housing owners to use their property in the manner they deem most economically efficient.
B: The city must demonstrate that the ordinance is necessary to serve a compelling state interest, because it will have a substantial and disproportionate negative impact on low-income persons.
C: The plaintiff must demonstrate that the ordinance is not substantially related to an important state interest, because it requires some owners of rental housing to invest money that they will not be able to recoup from increased rents.
D: The plaintiff must demonstrate that there is no rational relationship between the ordinance and any legitimate state interest, because the ordinance regulates economic activity of a type normally presumed to be within state regulatory authority.

Okay, so I'm looking at this question about a city ordinance affecting rental housing and whether it's constitutional. Hmm, the question is about the burden of persuasion in a lawsuit challenging the ordinance. Let me break this down step by step.

So the city passed an ordinance that requires all new and existing rental units to have at least one bathroom per bedroom, plumbing and electrical hookups for a washer and dryer, and covered parking. The existing rental owners opposed it, saying it would reduce low-income housing because they can't afford to comply without raising rents. But the city enacted it anyway, and now a plaintiff is suing, claiming the ordinance is unconstitutional on its face.

The question is about who has the burden of persuasion here and what they need to show. The options are from A to D, and I need to pick the correct one.

I remember that when a law is challenged as unconstitutional, the court usually applies a certain level of scrutiny. The levels I know are rational basis, intermediate scrutiny, and strict scrutiny. The level depends on what kind of right is affected or the type of classification made.

In this case, the ordinance is about housing, specifically rental properties. It's an economic regulation, I think. So the question is, does it implicate a fundamental right? Or is it just an economic regulation subject to rational basis?

I recall that economic regulations are generally subject to the rational basis test. Under rational basis, the government's action is upheld if it's rationally related to a legitimate government interest. The burden is on the plaintiff to show that there's no rational basis.

Wait, but sometimes when laws affect certain groups disproportionately, like low-income people, or if they implicate fundamental rights, the court might apply a higher level of scrutiny.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The city must show a compelling interest because it affects the right of property owners to use their property as they wish. Hmm, property rights are important, but I think the Supreme Court has held that economic regulations, even those affecting property, are reviewed under rational basis unless they take property without compensation (which would be a takings clause issue, not the case here). So maybe A is incorrect.

Option B: The city must show a compelling interest because it has a substantial and disproportionate negative impact on low-income persons. This sounds like it's applying strict scrutiny because of a disparate impact on a particular group. But I think the Supreme Court doesn't automatically apply strict scrutiny just because a law affects low-income people disproportionately. They might apply a higher level if it's based on a suspect classification, but economic status isn't a suspect classification. So I don't think B is correct.

Option C: The plaintiff must show the ordinance isn't substantially related to an important state interest. This sounds like intermediate scrutiny, which applies when there's a significant infringement on a constitutional right, like gender or religion. I don't think that applies here because this is an economic regulation, not impinging on such rights. So C might not be correct.

Option D: The plaintiff must show there's no rational relationship between the ordinance and a legitimate state interest. This fits with the rational basis test, which is the default for economic regulations. Since the ordinance is about housing standards and public health/safety, which are legitimate state interests, the plaintiff would have to show that the ordinance isn't rationally related to such interests. So D seems correct.

Wait, but let me make sure. The question is about the burden of persuasion. In rational basis, the plaintiff (challenger) has the burden to show that the law isn't rationally related. So in this case, the plaintiff would need to prove that there's no rational relationship, which is what option D states.

So the correct answer should be D.

The question concerns the constitutionality of a city ordinance requiring rental housing units to meet specific standards, and the burden of persuasion in a lawsuit challenging the ordinance. The ordinance mandates one bathroom per bedroom, plumbing and electrical hookups for a washer and dryer, and a covered parking space. The plaintiff argues the ordinance is unconstitutional on its face.

Economic regulations, such as this ordinance, are typically reviewed under the rational basis test. Under this standard, the government's action is upheld if it is rationally related to a legitimate government interest. The burden of persuasion lies with the plaintiff to demonstrate that the ordinance lacks a rational relationship to any legitimate state interest.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** suggests strict scrutiny because the ordinance affects property rights. However, economic regulations affecting property are generally subject to rational basis review unless they involve a taking without compensation, which is not the case here. Thus, A is incorrect.
- **Option B** implies strict scrutiny due to a disproportionate impact on low-income persons. However, economic status is not a suspect classification, and strict scrutiny does not automatically apply to laws affecting low-income individuals. Thus, B is incorrect.
- **Option C** suggests intermediate scrutiny, but this applies to significant infringements on constitutional rights like gender or religion, which are not at issue here. Thus, C is incorrect.
- **Option D** correctly states that the plaintiff must show there is no rational relationship between the ordinance and a legitimate state interest, aligning with the rational basis test applicable to economic regulations.

The correct answer is:

**D: The plaintiff must demonstrate that there is no rational relationship between the ordinance and any legitimate state interest, because the ordinance regulates economic activity of a type normally presumed to be within state regulatory authority.**

Answer: D
