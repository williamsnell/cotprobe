Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about criminal law, specifically what crime the gang leader committed. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: A new gang member wants to impress the leader, so he points a gun at a pedestrian and orders her to hand over her expensive watch. She complies, and then the gang member tosses the watch to the leader, who pockets it. The pedestrian runs away.

The question is asking what crime the gang leader committed. The options are A to J, but let me focus on the ones provided.

I think the key here is to determine the gang leader's involvement and intent. So, what's the initial crime? The gang member committed robbery because he used force (gun) to take the watch. Robbery is the unlawful taking of property using force or fear.

Now, what about the leader? He was nearby, the watch was tossed to him, and he took it. Did he have any prior agreement or knowledge? The question says the leader was totally surprised, so he didn't plan this with the new member. But he accepted the watch and pocketed it.

So, was the leader an accomplice? Well, accomplice usually requires that the person assists or encourages the crime, and does so with the intent to help. But if he was surprised, maybe he didn't have prior intent. So perhaps he's not an accomplice in the robbery itself.

Another angle is receiving stolen property. Theft by receiving involves knowingly receiving property that's been stolen, intending to deprive the owner. So, when the leader took the watch, did he know it was stolen? The question doesn't specify, but since the gang member just robbed someone, it's reasonable to assume the leader knew the watch was stolen. So, by taking it, he committed theft by receiving.

Looking at the options:

A: Accomplice to robbery. Hmm, accomplice requires aiding the robbery. If he didn't know beforehand, maybe not. But if he accepted the stolen goods knowing, does that count? Maybe, but I'm not sure.

B: Accessory before the fact. That would mean he helped plan the robbery. But he was surprised, so probably not.

C: Coercion. Doesn't seem to fit because he didn't force anyone to do anything.

D: No crime. No, because he took stolen property.

E: Theft by receiving. That fits because he knowingly received stolen property.

F: Accessory after the fact. That's someone who helps a criminal after the crime, like hiding them. Doesn't apply here.

G: Aggravated assault. He didn't assault anyone; the robbery was done by the member.

H: Grand larceny. That's stealing property of high value. But he didn't take it himself; he received it.

I: Conspiracy. Would require agreement to commit the crime. He was surprised, so no prior agreement.

So, putting it together, the leader committed theft by receiving stolen property. So the correct answer should be E: Theft by receiving.

The gang leader committed the crime of theft by receiving. He knowingly accepted the stolen watch from the gang member, who had just robbed the pedestrian. Since the leader was aware the watch was stolen and chose to keep it, he is guilty of receiving stolen property.

Answer: E
