Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about the folk saying "opposites attract." The question is asking about what current research says regarding whether dissimilar attitudes lead to liking. The options are from A to J.

First, I remember that there's a common belief that opposites attract, but I've also heard that research doesn't always support this. I think in psychology, there's something about similarity leading to attraction. Oh right, the similarity-attraction effect. People tend to like those who are similar in attitudes, values, etc. So maybe the saying isn't really true according to research.

The question is about when "opposites attract" is considered. So the options are testing whether it's true for certain groups or situations. Let me go through each option.

Option A: True for heterosexuals but not homosexuals. I don't recall any specific research that splits it this way. It might be more about overall patterns rather than sexual orientation. So maybe not A.

Option B: True for men but not women. Again, I don't remember gender being a big factor here. It's possible, but I don't think this is the case.

Option C: True for homosexuals but not heterosexuals. Similar to A, I don't think the research makes this distinction.

Option D: True for women but not men. Same issue as B; I don't think gender splits it like that.

Option E: True for people with certain personality traits. Hmm, that's possible. Maybe some personalities are more drawn to opposites, but I think the overall trend is towards similarity.

Option F: True in some cultures but not others. Culture can influence many aspects, but I'm not sure about this specific one. I think attraction tendencies are more universal, but maybe not. Not sure.

Option G: It does not seem to be true. This aligns with what I remember. Research shows that similarity is more important than opposites, so the saying isn't supported.

Option H: True only in certain situations. Maybe, but I think the main finding is that opposites don't attract as much as similars do.

Option I: True for older adults but not younger. I don't remember age being a factor here. Maybe older people value different things, but I'm not certain.

Option J: True for younger but not older. Again, age might influence what people look for in a partner, but I don't think it's the main point of the research.

So putting it all together, the main point is that research doesn't support "opposites attract." The correct answer should be G: It does not seem to be true.

The question examines the validity of the saying "opposites attract" in light of current research. Psychological studies, particularly the similarity-attraction effect, suggest that people are more drawn to those with similar attitudes, values, and traits rather than those who are dissimilar. This indicates that the folk saying is not supported by research. The options provided test various scenarios, but the overwhelming evidence points to the conclusion that "opposites attract" does not hold true according to research findings.

Answer: G
