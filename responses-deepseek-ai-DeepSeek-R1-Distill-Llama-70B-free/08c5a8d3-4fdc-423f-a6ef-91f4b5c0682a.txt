Question:

What are factors which affect concept attainment and how does each affect the learning of concepts?

Options:

A: The factors are the socioeconomic status of the student, the educational policies in place, and the consistency of teaching styles.
B: The factors include the pacing of the curriculum, the extracurricular activities of the student, and peer influence.
C: The factors which affect concept attainment are the dominance of cues in the stimuli, feedback and reinforcement after performance, and the selection and organization of information.
D: The factors are the student's genetic predispositions, the color of the classroom walls, and the seating arrangements.

Okay, I need to figure out the correct answer to this question about factors affecting concept attainment and how each affects learning. So, let's start by understanding what concept attainment means. From what I remember, concept attainment is the process by which learners acquire concepts, which are like mental categories that help us organize information.

The question is asking for the factors that influence this process and their effects on learning. The options are A through D, so I'll need to evaluate each one.

Looking at option A: It mentions socioeconomic status, educational policies, and teaching consistency. Socioeconomic status does affect education, like access to resources, but I'm not sure if it's directly a factor in concept attainment. Teaching consistency might influence how well concepts are taught, but these seem broader than specific factors related to concept learning.

Option B talks about curriculum pacing, extracurricular activities, and peer influence. Curriculum pacing could definitely affect how well a student grasps conceptsâ€”too fast and they might miss out, too slow and they might get bored. Extracurricular activities might take time away from studying, but I'm not sure they directly impact concept attainment. Peer influence could affect motivation, but again, not sure if it's a primary factor in how concepts are learned.

Option C lists dominance of cues, feedback/reinforcement, and selection/organization of information. Dominance of cues refers to which parts of the stimuli are most noticeable. In concept learning, highlighting key features helps. Feedback and reinforcement are crucial because they let learners know if they're correct and encourage them. Selection and organization of info by the teacher would structure learning, making concepts clearer. This option seems very relevant to the process of learning concepts.

Option D includes genetic predispositions, wall color, and seating. Genetics might influence ability, but that's more about individual differences rather than the process of concept attainment. Classroom environment factors like wall color and seating might affect comfort or focus, but again, not directly tied to concept learning mechanisms.

So, putting it all together, the factors that directly affect how concepts are learned are things like the cues presented, the feedback given, and how information is organized. That points to option C as the correct answer.

The correct answer is option C because it directly addresses factors that influence the process of concept attainment, such as the prominence of cues, feedback, and information organization, which are key to effective concept learning.

Answer: C
