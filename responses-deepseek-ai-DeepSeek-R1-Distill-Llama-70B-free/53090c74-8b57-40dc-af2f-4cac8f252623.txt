Okay, I need to figure out where the Big Mac is the most expensive. Hmm, the question gives exchange rates and the prices in each country. Let's break it down step by step.

First, the exchange rates are:

- 0.5 British Pounds (GBP) per dollar. So, 1 USD = 0.5 GBP. That means the pound is stronger than the dollar here. Wait, no, waitâ€”wait, if I have dollars and I get pounds, so 1 USD is worth half a pound. So, to get one pound, I need two dollars. That makes the pound more valuable.

- 10 Mexican Pesos (MXN) per dollar. So, 1 USD = 10 MXN. Pesos are worth less than dollars. So, more pesos per dollar.

- 100 Chinese Yuan (CNY) per dollar. 1 USD = 100 CNY. So, yuan are weaker than the dollar.

Now, the prices of a Big Mac in each country:

- America: $3. That's straightforward.

- England: 2 pounds. I need to convert that to USD to compare. Since 1 USD = 0.5 GBP, how much is 2 GBP in USD? Let's see, if 0.5 GBP = 1 USD, then 1 GBP = 2 USD. So 2 GBP would be 4 USD. Oh, that's higher than the US price.

- Mexico: 50 pesos. Convert to USD. Since 1 USD = 10 MXN, 50 MXN is 5 USD. Wait, because 10 MXN = 1 USD, so 50 divided by 10 is 5. So that's 5 USD.

- China: 200 yuan. Convert to USD. 100 CNY = 1 USD, so 200 CNY is 2 USD. That's cheaper than the US price.

So now, let's list the USD equivalents:

- America: $3.

- England: $4.

- Mexico: $5.

- China: $2.

So the most expensive is Mexico at $5, followed by England at $4, then the US at $3, and China the cheapest at $2.

Wait, but wait the options are labeled, let me check the options again. The options are A to D, each representing a country's Big Mac price in USD.

Wait, the options are:

A: America ($3).

B: England ($4).

C: Mexico ($5).

D: China ($2).

So the question is asking which country has the most expensive Big Mac. From the calculations, Mexico's Big Mac is $5, which is the highest. So the correct answer should be option C: Mexico ($5).

To determine where the Big Mac is most expensive, we convert the prices in each country to USD using the given exchange rates:

- **America**: The Big Mac costs $3 in USD.
- **England**: The Big Mac costs 2 GBP. Since 1 GBP = 2 USD, 2 GBP = $4.
- **Mexico**: The Big Mac costs 50 MXN. Since 1 USD = 10 MXN, 50 MXN = $5.
- **China**: The Big Mac costs 200 CNY. Since 1 USD = 100 CNY, 200 CNY = $2.

Comparing these values, the Big Mac is most expensive in **Mexico** at $5. 

The correct answer is **C: Mexico ($5)**.
