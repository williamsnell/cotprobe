Okay, so I've got this problem here about Felton Farm Supplies, Inc. I'm a bit new to this kind of stuff, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says that Felton Farm Supplies has an 8 percent return on total assets of $300,000 and a net profit margin of 5 percent. They're asking what the sales are, and there are multiple-choice options to choose from.

Hmm, I remember that return on assets (ROA) and net profit margin are both financial ratios that help assess a company's profitability. Let me think about what each of these means.

ROA is calculated as net income divided by total assets. So ROA = Net Income / Total Assets. They've given the ROA as 8% and the total assets as $300,000. So I can use that to find the net income.

Let me write that down: 
ROA = Net Income / Total Assets
0.08 = Net Income / 300,000
So, Net Income = 0.08 * 300,000 = $24,000.

Wait, that seems right. So the net income is $24,000.

Next, the net profit margin is given as 5%. Net profit margin is calculated as Net Income divided by Sales. So the formula is Net Profit Margin = Net Income / Sales.

We have the net income as $24,000 and the net profit margin as 5%, which is 0.05. So plugging those into the formula:

0.05 = 24,000 / Sales
To find Sales, I can rearrange the formula: Sales = 24,000 / 0.05.

Let me calculate that. 24,000 divided by 0.05 is the same as 24,000 multiplied by 20, because 1/0.05 is 20. So 24,000 * 20 = 480,000. Wait, that would mean Sales are $480,000. But looking at the options, I don't see that immediately. Let me check the options again.

Wait, looking at the options: A is 2 million, B is 300k, C is 900k, D is 3.75 million, E is 600k, F is 750k, G is 1.5 million, H is 2.4 million, I is 480k, J is 1.2 million.

Oh, option I is $480,000. So that's the sales figure. But wait, that doesn't seem right because 480k seems low if the total assets are 300k. Wait, no, that's possible because sales can be higher or lower than assets, depending on the business.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I mix up the formulas. So ROA is Net Income / Total Assets, which gave me 24k. Then Net Profit Margin is Net Income / Sales, which would be 24k / Sales = 0.05, so Sales is 24k / 0.05.

Yes, that's 480k. So the correct answer should be I: $480,000.

Wait a minute, but sometimes I get confused between return on equity and return on assets. Oh no, in this case, it's definitely ROA because the question says return on total assets, so that part is correct.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about other ratios, but I don't think that's necessary here. The approach seems straightforward.

So I think I did it right. The sales are $480,000, which is option I.

To determine Felton Farm Supplies, Inc.'s sales, we start with the given data:

1. **Return on Assets (ROA)** is 8%, and total assets are $300,000.  
   Using the formula:  
   \[
   \text{ROA} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Total Assets}}
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   0.08 = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{300,000}
   \]  
   Solving for Net Income:  
   \[
   \text{Net Income} = 0.08 \times 300,000 = 24,000
   \]

2. **Net Profit Margin** is 5%. Using the formula:  
   \[
   \text{Net Profit Margin} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{\text{Sales}}
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   0.05 = \frac{24,000}{\text{Sales}}
   \]  
   Solving for Sales:  
   \[
   \text{Sales} = \frac{24,000}{0.05} = 480,000
   \]

Thus, Felton Farm Supplies, Inc.'s sales are **$480,000**, which corresponds to option **I**.
