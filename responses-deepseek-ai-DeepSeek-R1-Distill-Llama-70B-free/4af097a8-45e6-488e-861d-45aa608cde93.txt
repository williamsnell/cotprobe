Question:

A supermarket had just reopened after a two- week closing for renovations. On the morning of the reopening, a woman was shopping when she suddenly fell and suffered a broken leg. Thereafter, the woman sued the supermarket for personal injuries. In her suit, the woman claimed that she tripped over a paint bucket that had been lying in one of the aisles. At trial, the woman called another customer to testify that while he was shopping he heard a thud, turned around and saw the woman fall on the floor. He also testified that he saw an empty paint bucket lying a few feet from the woman's leg. On cross- examination, the customer got into an argumentative exchange with the supermarket's attorney. When asked his opinion of what caused the woman's fall, the customer testified, "She fell because she tripped on the bucket. " He admitted on cross-examination, however, that he didn't actually see the woman trip on the bucket. The supermarket's attorney then asked the customer the following question:"If you didn't see the woman trip on the bucket, how do you know that she fell because of it?" The customer answered, "Because my girlfriend who was shopping with me told me later that she saw the woman trip over the bucket. "The supermarket's attorney moves to strike the customer's last answer. If the trial judge overrules the defendant's motion and permits the customer's answer to stand, it will most likely be because

Options:

A: the customer's answer was based on a reliable source.
B: the customer's answer was invited by the supermarket's attorney's question.

Okay, so I've got this evidence question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The scenario is a supermarket that reopened after renovations. A woman fell and broke her leg, and she's suing the supermarket. She claims she tripped over a paint bucket in an aisle. At trial, she called another customer as a witness. This customer testified that he heard a thud, turned around, and saw the woman fall. He also saw an empty paint bucket a few feet from her leg. 

On cross-examination, the customer got into an argument with the supermarket's attorney. When asked his opinion on what caused the fall, he said she fell because she tripped on the bucket. But he admitted he didn't actually see her trip on it. Then the attorney asked, if he didn't see it, how does he know? The customer answered that his girlfriend told him she saw the woman trip over the bucket.

Now, the supermarket's attorney moves to strike that last answer, but the judge overrules it. The question is why the judge permitted it, and we have to choose the correct reason from the options A to I.

First, I need to figure out what kind of evidence the customer's last statement is and whether it's admissible.

From what I remember, hearsay is a big issue here. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered for the truth of the matter asserted. So, the customer is testifying about what his girlfriend told him. That sounds like hearsay because the girlfriend's statement is being used to prove that the woman tripped on the bucket.

But wait, there are exceptions to the hearsay rule. So, I need to think about which exceptions might apply here. The customer's statement is based on what his girlfriend said, so if that's admissible under an exception, then the judge wouldn't strike it.

Let me go through the options to see which one fits.

Option A: The customer's answer was based on a reliable source. Hmm, reliability is a factor in some exceptions, like for business records or medical records, but I'm not sure if that applies here.

Option B: The answer was invited by the attorney's question. I'm not too sure about this. If the attorney's question opened the door, maybe it's allowed, but I think that's more about relevance than hearsay.

Option C: It was a lay opinion. Lay opinion is allowed under FRE 701, but the opinion has to be based on the witness's perception. Here, the customer's opinion is based on hearsay—the girlfriend's statement—so it wouldn't qualify as a valid lay opinion.

Option D: Excited utterance. FRE 803(2) covers excited utterances made under stress of the event. But the girlfriend's statement was made later, when she told the customer. So unless it was made right when the event happened, it might not qualify.

Option E: Statement of recent perception. I'm not sure about this one. Maybe recent perception is under FRE 803(1), which allows a statement describing an event made while the declarant was perceiving it or immediately thereafter. But again, the timing matters. If the girlfriend told him later that day, maybe, but if it was much later, it might not fit.

Option F: Based on firsthand knowledge. The customer's knowledge is secondhand because he's recounting his girlfriend's statement. So this doesn't apply.

Option G: Present sense impression. FRE 803(1) again, which is a statement describing an event made while perceiving it or immediately after. If the girlfriend made the statement right when she saw it, maybe, but the customer is recounting it later. So it might not fit unless the statement was made in the present sense when the customer heard it.

Option H: Spontaneous statement. Similar to excited utterance, under FRE 803(2), but again, the timing matters. If the girlfriend's statement was spontaneous when she saw it, but the customer is testifying about it later, it might not apply here.

Option I: Relevant to the case. Well, yes, it's relevant, but the issue is whether it's hearsay and if an exception applies. So relevance alone doesn't make it admissible if it's hearsay.

Wait, but I'm probably missing something. The customer's statement is that his girlfriend told him she saw it. So that's hearsay within hearsay—two layers. The customer's statement is hearsay (statement of the girlfriend offered for truth), and if the girlfriend's statement is also hearsay, unless there's an exception for each layer.

Alternatively, maybe the statement is not being offered for the truth. But in this context, the customer's answer is clearly being offered to prove that the woman tripped on the bucket, so it is for the truth.

So the key is, is there an exception that allows the girlfriend's statement to come in through the customer's testimony.

Wait, another angle: when a witness testifies about a statement made by someone else, it's hearsay unless an exception applies. So the customer is recounting the girlfriend's statement, which is hearsay. So unless it's covered by an exception, it should be inadmissible.

But the question says the judge overruled the motion to strike, so the answer must be that the evidence was admissible under an exception.

Looking back at the options, let's think about the possible exceptions again.

Option G: Present sense impression. That's when a statement is made while perceiving an event or immediately thereafter. So if the girlfriend was describing the event as she was seeing it, that might fit.

But in this case, the customer is testifying about what the girlfriend told him later. So if the girlfriend's statement was made while she was perceiving the event, it could be a present sense impression. But the customer is recounting it later, so maybe it's admissible as a present sense impression.

Wait, but the hearsay exception for present sense impression (FRE 803(1)) doesn't require the declarant to testify, so the girlfriend's statement could be admissible through the customer if it was a present sense impression.

Alternatively, maybe it's a statement of a witness's then-existing state of mind, but that's more about the witness's memory.

Another thought: the customer's testimony about the girlfriend's statement could be allowed as a statement against interest or some other exception, but I don't think that applies here.

Wait, perhaps the statement is admissible as a statement of a witness's perception, but that's if the witness (the customer) perceived it himself, which he didn't—he's getting it from the girlfriend.

Wait, maybe the customer's answer is not hearsay. Because when the attorney asked, "If you didn't see the woman trip on the bucket, how do you know that she fell because of it?" The customer's answer is explaining the basis for his earlier opinion. But his earlier opinion was that she tripped on the bucket, and he based that on the girlfriend's statement. So when he explains how he knows, he's recounting the girlfriend's statement, which is hearsay.

So unless there's an exception, it should be excluded. But the judge allowed it, so there must be an exception.

Another possibility: the statement might qualify under the "residual exception" (FRE 807), but that requires the statement to have high guarantees of trustworthiness and other factors. I think that's less likely here.

Wait, perhaps the girlfriend's statement is admissible as a present sense impression if she made it while perceiving the event. So if she said, "She tripped on the bucket!" right when she saw it, that would be a present sense impression. But the customer is testifying about it later, so it's being offered through him.

But I'm not sure if that's the right fit. Alternatively, maybe the statement is not hearsay because it's offered to show that the customer formed an opinion, not for the truth. But that doesn't seem right because the purpose is to establish that she tripped on the bucket.

Wait, maybe the customer's testimony is about his own basis for his opinion, which is allowed. But under FRE 701, lay opinions must be based on the witness's perception. So if the customer based his opinion on what his girlfriend told him, that might not be allowed because it's hearsay.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think about each option again.

Option B: The answer was invited by the attorney's question. So if the attorney's question led the customer to explain how he knew, maybe the attorney can't complain if the response is hearsay. But I'm not sure if that's a valid reason. I think that's more about opening the door to evidence, but it's not an exception to hearsay.

Option E: Statement of recent perception. If the girlfriend's statement was made recently after the event, like within hours, it could be admissible as a statement of recent perception. But I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the customer's answer was a lay opinion, which is allowed under FRE 701. But earlier I thought that the opinion has to be based on the witness's own perception, not on hearsay. So if the customer's opinion is based on what his girlfriend told him, that's hearsay, so it's not a valid lay opinion.

Alternatively, maybe the customer's statement is a lay opinion, and the basis for it is allowed to be explored, but the basis itself can't introduce new hearsay.

Wait, but the customer's opinion was already given, and on cross, the attorney is challenging the basis. So the customer's explanation of the basis (that his girlfriend told him) would be admissible as non-hearsay because it's explaining his opinion, not offered for the truth of the matter. Or is it?

No, because the statement is being offered to prove that she tripped on the bucket, so it's for the truth, making it hearsay. So unless there's an exception, it's inadmissible.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe the answer is B, that the attorney's question invited the response. Because the attorney asked, "how do you know," which led the customer to explain the basis, and perhaps the attorney can't object when they opened the door.

But I'm not sure if that's a valid hearsay exception. I think that's more about relevance and whether the evidence is responsive, not about hearsay.

Alternatively, maybe the customer's answer is a statement of the girlfriend's then-existing state of mind. But that's under FRE 803(3), which allows statements showing the declarant's then state of mind, emotion, etc. But that's usually for the declarant's motive or intent, not for an event they observed.

Wait, but in this case, the girlfriend's statement is about an event she observed, so it's being used for the truth, not her state of mind. So that exception wouldn't apply.

I'm going in circles here. Let me try to approach it differently. The possible reasons the evidence was allowed are:

1. It's not hearsay because it's offered for a non-hearsay purpose, like to show the customer's basis for his opinion, but that doesn't seem right because the purpose is to prove she tripped on the bucket.

2. It's hearsay but falls under an exception, such as present sense impression, excited utterance, or statement of recent perception.

3. It's allowed as a lay opinion under FRE 701, but that requires the opinion to be based on the witness's own perception, which it's not.

So, perhaps the correct answer is B, that the attorney's question invited the response, making it admissible. But I'm not certain because I thought that's more about the form of the question rather than hearsay exceptions.

Wait, another angle: when a witness gives an opinion, they can be examined on the basis of that opinion, and if the basis includes hearsay, that might be allowed because it's not being offered for the truth. But no, because the basis here is being used to prove the underlying fact, which is hearsay.

Hmm, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me look at the options again.

Option E: Statement of recent perception. If the girlfriend made the statement soon after the event, it could be admissible. But the customer is testifying about it later, so I'm not sure.

Option G: Present sense impression. If the girlfriend's statement was made while she was perceiving the event, that could be a present sense impression. But the customer is recounting it later, so the timing might be an issue.

Wait, the present sense impression exception allows for a statement made while perceiving an event or immediately thereafter. So if the girlfriend said, "She tripped on the bucket!" right when it happened, that would be a present sense impression. Then, when the customer testifies about it, as long as it's being offered under that exception, it's admissible.

But wait, the customer didn't hear it immediately; he heard it later that day or whenever. So maybe the statement isn't a present sense impression when the customer heard it, but the girlfriend's statement was. So the statement would be admissible as a present sense impression, even though the customer is testifying about it later.

So perhaps the correct answer is G: the customer's answer was a present sense impression.

Alternatively, maybe it's a statement of recent perception. But I'm not sure about the exact definitions.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is B, that the attorney's question invited the response, but I don't think that's a valid hearsay exception.

Wait, another thought: when a witness is cross-examined and their opinion is challenged, they can explain the basis, and sometimes that basis, even if hearsay, is allowed because it's part of the examination. But I'm not sure if that's an exception or just a procedural rule.

I'm really torn between options B and G. But I think the better answer is G, present sense impression, because the girlfriend's statement was made while she was perceiving the event, making it admissible under that exception.

Wait, but the customer is testifying about the girlfriend's statement, so it's hearsay within hearsay. The first layer is the girlfriend's statement, and the second is the customer's testimony about it. So both layers need to fall under exceptions or be non-hearsay.

The girlfriend's statement would be hearsay, but if it's a present sense impression, that's an exception. The customer's statement about what the girlfriend said is also hearsay, but perhaps it's not because he's testifying about a statement made to him, which might not be hearsay if it's not offered for the truth. Wait, no, because the statement is offered for the truth, so it's hearsay.

Wait, but the customer's statement is about what the girlfriend told him, which is hearsay. So unless the customer's statement falls under an exception, it's inadmissible. But the first layer (girlfriend's statement) could be a present sense impression, making her statement admissible, and the customer's testimony about it is just the method of introducing that statement. So the whole thing would be admissible under the present sense impression exception.

So the judge allowed it because the statement was a present sense impression, making option G the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: the customer's answer was a lay opinion, but that's not right because the opinion is based on hearsay.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a statement of recent perception under FRE 803(1), which allows a statement of perception made at the time of perception or immediately thereafter. So the girlfriend's statement was made right after she saw the incident, making it a statement of recent perception, which is an exception.

So perhaps the answer is E: statement of recent perception.

I think I'm mixing up present sense impression and statement of recent perception. Let me clarify:

- Present sense impression (FRE 803(1)): A statement describing an event made while the declarant was perceiving it or immediately thereafter.

- Statement of recent perception (I think this is under FRE 803(1) as well, but sometimes referred to as a "fresh complaint" in sexual assault cases, which is a different exception).

Wait, no, FRE 803(1) is present sense impression and statement of recent perception. Wait, no, FRE 803(1) says:

"A statement describing or explaining an event or condition, made while the declarant was perceiving it or immediately thereafter..."

So it's present sense impression. Then, there's also the "statement of recent perception" which I think is part of the same exception.

Wait, no, I think I'm confusing with another exception. Maybe the statement of recent perception is under a different rule, but I'm not sure.

In any case, the key point is that if the girlfriend's statement was made while she was perceiving the event or immediately after, it's a present sense impression and thus admissible.

So the customer's testimony about the girlfriend's statement would be allowed under the present sense impression exception, making option G correct.

Alternatively, if the girlfriend's statement was made a short time after the event but not immediately, it might not qualify as present sense impression but could fall under another exception, but I think present sense is the best fit here.

So, putting it all together, the judge allowed the statement because it was a present sense impression, so the answer is G.

The question revolves around the admissibility of a statement made by a customer in a supermarket slip-and-fall case. The customer testified that his girlfriend told him she saw the woman trip over a paint bucket. The supermarket's attorney moved to strike this statement, but the judge overruled the motion. The task is to determine why the judge permitted the statement to stand.

The customer's statement is hearsay because it is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted (that the woman tripped on the bucket). Hearsay is generally inadmissible unless an exception applies. The analysis focuses on identifying which hearsay exception allows the statement to be admitted.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: The customer's answer was based on a reliable source.**  
   While reliability can be a factor in some hearsay exceptions, it is not a standalone exception. This option does not directly address why the statement was admissible.

2. **Option B: The customer's answer was invited by the supermarket's attorney's question.**  
   Although the attorney's question may have led the customer to explain the basis for his opinion, this does not constitute a hearsay exception. The admissibility of evidence is determined by substantive rules of evidence, not by whether a question "opened the door."

3. **Option C: The customer's answer was a lay opinion.**  
   Under FRE 701, lay opinions must be based on the witness's own perception. Here, the customer's opinion was based on his girlfriend's statement, which is hearsay. Therefore, this option does not apply.

4. **Option D: The customer's answer was an excited utterance.**  
   An excited utterance (FRE 803(2)) is a statement made under the stress of a startling event. The girlfriend's statement was made after the event, so it does not qualify as an excited utterance.

5. **Option E: The
