Okay, so I have this logic problem here about identifying the antecedent of a conditional proposition. The statement given is: "The university raises tuition only if both the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it." Hmm, I remember that in logic, conditional statements are usually in the form "If P, then Q", where P is the antecedent and Q is the consequent. But sometimes the phrasing can be a bit tricky, especially with "only if" clauses.

Wait, let me think. I think "only if" works a bit differently. From what I recall, "A only if B" is logically equivalent to "If A then B". So in this case, the statement is "The university raises tuition only if both the governor approves and the board recommends." So according to the structure, A is "The university raises tuition", and B is "both the governor approves and the board recommends."

So the original statement is A only if B, which translates to A → B. Therefore, the antecedent of this conditional would be A, right? Because in the conditional statement A → B, A is the antecedent. So in this case, A is "The university raises tuition." Looking at the options, that would correspond to option H, which says "The university raises tuition."

Wait, but let me double-check. The problem is asking for the antecedent of the conditional proposition. So the conditional here is A → B. The antecedent is the part before the arrow, which is A. So the antecedent is "The university raises tuition", which is option H.

I think that's correct. So the answer should be H.

The conditional proposition is "The university raises tuition only if both the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it." This is logically equivalent to "If the university raises tuition, then both the governor approves of it and the board of trustees recommends it." In this structure, the antecedent is "The university raises tuition," which corresponds to option H.

Answer: H
