Question:

In fruit flies, black body color (b) is recessive to the normal wild-type body color (b^+). Cinnabar eye (cn) is recessive to the normal wild-type eye color (cn^+). A homozygous wild-type fly was mated to a fly with black body and cinnabar eyes. The resulting heterozygous F_1 fly was mated to a fly with black body and cinnabar eyes. These were the results in the offspring: 90 wild-type 92 black body and cinnabar eyes 9 black body and wild-type eyes 9 wild-type body and cinnabar eyes What is the map distance between the gene for black body and the gene for cinnabar eyes?

Options:

A: Twelve map units
B: Two hundred map units
C: Forty map units
D: One hundred map units
E: Five map units
F: Twenty-five map units
G: Seventy-five map units
H: Nine map units
I: Eighteen map units
J: Fifty map units

Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about fruit flies and their traits. I'm a bit rusty, but let's try to think this through step by step.

Alright, the problem says that black body (b) is recessive to wild-type (b+), and cinnabar eye (cn) is also recessive to wild-type (cn+). So, both traits are recessive. 

The first cross is between a homozygous wild-type fly and a fly with black body and cinnabar eyes. Since wild-type is dominant, the wild-type parent must be B+ B+ and cn+ cn+, right? And the other parent is bb cc because both traits are recessive. So, the F1 flies would all be B+ b cn+ cn, which are heterozygous for both traits. That makes sense because each parent contributes one allele for each gene.

Then, the F1 fly is mated to a fly with black body and cinnabar eyes. So that would be F1 (B+ b cn+ cn) x (bb cc). Wait, no—the second parent is bb cc because for each trait they're homozygous recessive. So the F1 is the heterozygote, and the other parent is the recessive for both.

So the cross would be like this: for each gene, it's a test cross. Because one parent is heterozygous (Bb) and the other is homozygous recessive (bb). Same for the cn gene.

Wait, the F1 is actually B+ b for the body color and cn+ cn for the eye color. So when they mate with bb cc, each trait will be tested. So for each gene, the F1 is Bb (since B+ is dominant, but the notation is maybe a bit different; perhaps it's B and b alleles, where B is wild-type dominant and b is recessive. Similarly, cn is recessive.)

Wait, perhaps I should think of each gene separately. Let's consider the black body gene. The F1 is Bb (since wild-type is B, and the other parent is bb). So when F1 (Bb) is crossed with bb, the possible offspring are Bb (50%) and bb (50%). Similarly for the cn gene: the F1 is Cn cn (assuming Cn is wild-type), so when crossed with cn cn, the offspring will be Cn cn (50%) and cn cn (50%).

But wait, the problem states that the F1 is mated to a fly with black body and cinnabar eyes, which is bb cc. So for each gene, it's a test cross (heterozygote x recessive). So the expected phenotypic ratio for each gene would be 1:1. But wait, the observed data is different. Let me look at the offspring results.

The results in the offspring are:
- 90 wild-type (so B+ and cn+)
- 92 black body and cinnabar eyes (bb and cc)
- 9 black body and wild-type eyes (bb and cn+ )
- 9 wild-type body and cinnabar eyes (B+ and cc)

Wait, so total offspring is 90 +92 +9 +9 = 200. That makes sense.

So for each trait, if the genes were not linked, we'd expect independent assortment, and the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1:1:1. But that's not what's happening here. The majority are wild-type (90) and double recessive (92), while the others are much fewer (9 each). So this suggests that the genes are linked, and crossing over is occurring at a certain rate.

Wait, but in a test cross like Bb × bb, the expected outcome is 50% Bb (wild-type) and 50% bb (black). Similarly for the other gene. But since the genes are linked, the actual results will show some non-Mendelian ratios, with more parental types and fewer recombinant types.

Wait, when two genes are linked, the recombinant frequency is lower than 50%. So the map distance would be based on the percentage of recombinant offspring.

In the data, the recombinant phenotypes are the 9 black body with wild-type eyes and the 9 wild-type body with cinnabar eyes. So each is 9/200, which totals 18/200 or 9%. Thus, the recombinant frequency is 9%.

So the map distance between the two genes is approx 9 map units. But wait, looking at the options, option H is nine, and option I is eighteen. Hmm, wait, wait. Let me double-check.

Wait, the recombinant phenotypes are the two classes that are non-parental. Parental phenotypes are the wild-type (B+ and cn+, which would come from no crossover) and the double recessive (bb and cc, which also would come from no crossover because the other parent is homozygous recessive). The recombinant phenotypes are when the two genes are separated. So in this case, the recombinant phenotypes are 9 +9 =18 individuals out of 200.

So the recombinant frequency is 18/200, which is 9%. So the map distance is 9 centimorgans. Looking at the options, option H is nine.

Wait, but I thought sometimes map distance is calculated as the sum of the single and double crossovers, but in this case, since it's a two-point test, only single crossovers are considered, and double crossovers are negligible because the map distance is small. So the recombinant frequency is about 9%, so the map units are nine.

Wait, but the question is about the F1 being mated to a recessive. The F1 is Bb CnCn × b b cc? Wait, no, the F1 is Bb CnCn, and the other parent is bb cc. So for each gene, it's a test cross.

Wait, so the F1 for each gene is heterozygous, and the other parent is homozygous recessive. So for each gene, you'd expect the F1 gametes to produce 50% dominant and 50% recessive. But when the genes are linked, the actual gametes will have more of the parental types and fewer recombinant types.

So the number of non-recombinant (parental) gametes would be higher, and the recombinant gametes lower.

In the offspring, the two recombinant classes (non-parental phenotypes) are 9 and 9, sum 18. So 18 out of 200, which is 9% recombinant frequency. So map distance is 9 map units.

Looking at the options, option H is nine map units. So the answer should be H.

To determine the map distance between the gene for black body (b) and the gene for cinnabar eyes (cn) in fruit flies, we analyze the offspring data from the given cross. The F1 fly, which is heterozygous for both traits (Bb CnCn), was mated to a fly homozygous for both recessive traits (bb cc). This is effectively a test cross, where the expected phenotypic ratio depends on the linkage between the two genes.

### Key Observations:
1. **Total Offspring**: 200 flies.
2. **Phenotypic Classes**:
   - 90 wild-type (B+ and cn+)
   - 92 black body and cinnabar eyes (bb and cc)
   - 9 black body and wild-type eyes (bb and cn+)
   - 9 wild-type body and cinnabar eyes (B+ and cc)

### Analysis:
- The two recombinant phenotypes (non-parental types) are **9 black body and wild-type eyes** and **9 wild-type body and cinnabar eyes**, totaling **18 recombinant offspring**.
- The recombinant frequency is calculated as:

  \[
  \text{Recombinant Frequency} = \frac{\text{Number of Recombinant Offspring}}{\text{Total Offspring}} = \frac{18}{200} = 0.09 \, (9\%).
  \]

- Map distance is equivalent to the recombinant frequency when the genes are closely linked, as double crossovers are negligible in this case.
- Therefore, the map distance between the two genes is **9 map units**.

### Conclusion:
The correct answer is **H: Nine map units**.
