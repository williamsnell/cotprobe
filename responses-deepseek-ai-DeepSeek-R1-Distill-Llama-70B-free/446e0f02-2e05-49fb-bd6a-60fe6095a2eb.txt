Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the maximum non-expansion work from a fuel cell when methane combusts. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Alright, the question says the reaction is the combustion of methane at 298 K. I remember that in a fuel cell, the maximum non-expansion work is related to the Gibbs free energy change, ΔG. Because for a reversible process at constant temperature and pressure, the maximum work is equal to the change in Gibbs free energy.

So the formula should be w_max = -ΔG. Oh wait, right, because Gibbs free energy gives the maximum non-expansion work. So I need to find ΔG for the combustion of methane.

What's the balanced equation for methane combustion? Methane (CH4) burns in oxygen (O2) to produce carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O). Let me write that out.

CH4 + 2 O2 → CO2 + 2 H2O.

Now, I need the standard Gibbs free energy of formation (ΔGf°) for each of these substances. I remember that elements in their standard state have ΔGf° of zero. So O2 is zero, CH4 has a certain value, CO2 another, and H2O another.

Wait, what about the state of water? Is it liquid or gas here? Oh, because the question says it's at 298 K, which is 25°C, so I think H2O is liquid. Because standard conditions usually consider H2O as liquid for these thermodynamic tables.

So I need to look up the standard Gibbs free energy of formation for each substance. Let me try to recall or reconstruct the values.

I think the standard ΔGf° for CH4 is negative, but wait, no, wait. Methane is a stable compound, so its ΔGf° should be negative. Wait, wait, no—wait no, the ΔGf° is the change when one mole is formed from its elements in their standard states. Methane is formed from carbon (graphite) and hydrogen gas.

Wait, I think the standard ΔGf° for CH4 is about -50 kJ/mol. Or wait, maybe I'm mixing it up with enthalpy. Let me think: For enthalpy, the ΔHf° of CH4 is around -74.8 kJ/mol, but for Gibbs, maybe it's around -50.5 kJ/mol. Hmm, but I'm not sure. I might need to look it up, but since I can't, I'll try to proceed with what I remember.

CO2 has a ΔGf° of around -394.4 kJ/mol. H2O, as liquid, is about -237.1 kJ/mol per mole. Let me confirm: yes, I think CO2 is about -394.4, and H2O(l) is -237.1. So for the reaction, we have:

ΔG° reaction = [ΔGf°(CO2) + 2 * ΔGf°(H2O)] - [ΔGf°(CH4) + 2*ΔGf°(O2)].

Since O2 is zero, that term drops out. So:

ΔG° = [ (1 * (-394.4)) + (2 * (-237.1)) ] - [ (1 * (-50.5)) + (0) ]

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the reaction is CH4 + 2O2 → CO2 + 2H2O.

So the products are 1 mole of CO2 and 2 moles of H2O. The reactants are 1 mole CH4 and 2 moles O2.

So the calculation should be:

ΔG° = [ (1)(ΔGf° CO2) + (2)(ΔGf° H2O) ) ] - [ (1)(ΔGf° CH4) + (2)(ΔGf° O2) ) ].

Plugging in the numbers:

ΔG° = [ (-394.4) + 2*(-237.1) ] - [ (-50.5) + 2*(0) ]

Calculating each part:

Products side: (-394.4) + (2 * -237.1) = -394.4 - 474.2 = -868.6 kJ.

Reactants side: (-50.5) + 0 = -50.5 kJ.

So ΔG° = (-868.6) - (-50.5) = (-868.6) +50.5 = -818.1 kJ/mol.

Wait, that's a big negative number. So the Gibbs free energy change is -818.1 kJ per mole of reaction as written.

But since the question is about the maximum non-expansion work, which is w_max = -ΔG. Because ΔG is negative, the work would be positive, meaning work is done by the system.

So w_max = -(-818.1 kJ/mol) = +818.1 kJ/mol.

Looking at the options, option B is 817.90 kJ/mol^-1. That's really close to my calculation of 818.1.

But wait, let me double-check my ΔGf values. Because maybe I got them wrong. Let me see:

Alternative values I've heard before:

ΔGf° for CH4 is -50.5 kJ/mol.

ΔGf° for CO2 is -394.4 kJ/mol.

ΔGf° for H2O(l) is -237.1 kJ/mol.

Yes, that's correct. So the calculation should be accurate.

Alternatively, perhaps the sign is different. Because sometimes people get confused with whether the cell reaction is written as the combustion (which is spontaneous, so ΔG is negative), so the work would be the negative of that.

Wait, but the formula I used was w_max = -ΔG. But wait, the ΔG is the change for the reaction as written. So in the reaction, the system releases energy, so ΔG is negative. The maximum work is the amount of useful work extracted, which would be the positive value, so -ΔG would be positive.

So with ΔG° = -818.1 kJ, w_max = +818.1 kJ/mol. So option B is 817.9, which is extremely close. Probably, the exact ΔGf values may have more decimal points, leading to slight variations.

Wait, perhaps I should be precise. Let me use more accurate values.

Let me think again. The standard ΔGf° for:

CH4(g): -50.5 kJ/mol.

CO2(g): -394.36 kJ/mol.

H2O(l): -237.13 kJ/mol.

So using these more precise numbers:

Products: [1 * (-394.36) + 2*(-237.13)] = (-394.36) + (-474.26) = -868.62 kJ.

Reactants: [1*(-50.5) + 2*(0)] = -50.5 kJ.

ΔG° = (-868.62) - (-50.5) = -868.62 +50.5 = -818.12 kJ/mol.

So w_max = -ΔG° = 818.12 kJ/mol.

Looking at the options, option B is 817.90, which is 817.9. That's very close to 818.12. The slight difference could be due to rounding in the ΔGf° values.

Wait, another possibility: sometimes the reaction is written per mole of methane, which it is here, so the calculation is correct.

But let me check the units in the options. The options are in kJ per mol, so yes, this matches.

So the correct answer should be option B: 817.90 kJ/mol^-1.

To calculate the maximum non-expansion work per mole that may be obtained from a fuel cell where the chemical reaction is the combustion of methane at 298 K, we use the relationship:

\[
w_{\text{max}} = -\Delta G^\circ
\]

where \(\Delta G^\circ\) is the standard Gibbs free energy change for the reaction. The combustion of methane is represented by the balanced equation:

\[
\text{CH}_4 + 2 \text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{CO}_2 + 2 \text{H}_2\text{O} \, (\text{liquid})
\]

The standard Gibbs free energy of formation (\(\Delta G_f^\circ\)) values for the reactants and products are:

- \(\Delta G_f^\circ(\text{CH}_4) = -50.5 \, \text{kJ/mol}\)
- \(\Delta G_f^\circ(\text{O}_2) = 0 \, \text{kJ/mol}\) (element in standard state)
- \(\Delta G_f^\circ(\text{CO}_2) = -394.4 \, \text{kJ/mol}\)
- \(\Delta G_f^\circ(\text{H}_2\text{O, liquid}) = -237.1 \, \text{kJ/mol}\)

Using these values, the Gibbs free energy change for the reaction is calculated as:

\[
\Delta G^\circ = \left[ \Delta G_f^\circ(\text{CO}_2) + 2 \cdot \Delta G_f^\circ(\text{H}_2\text{O}) \right] - \left[ \Delta G_f^\circ(\text{CH}_4) + 2 \cdot \Delta G_f^\circ(\text{O}_2) \right]
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\Delta G^\circ = \left[ (-394.4) + 2(-237.1) \right] - \left[ (-50.5) + 2(0) \right]
\]

\[
\Delta G^\circ = \left[ -394.4 - 474.2 \right] - \left[ -50.5 \right]
\]

\[
\Delta G^\circ = -868.6 + 50.5 = -818.1 \, \text{kJ/mol}
\]

The maximum non-expansion work is then:

\[
w_{\text{max}} = -\Delta G^\circ = -(-818.1) = 818.1 \, \text{kJ/mol}
\]

Among the given options, the closest value is **817.90 kJ/mol**, which corresponds to option **B**. The slight discrepancy is likely due to rounding differences in the \(\Delta G_f^\circ\) values.

**Answer: B**
