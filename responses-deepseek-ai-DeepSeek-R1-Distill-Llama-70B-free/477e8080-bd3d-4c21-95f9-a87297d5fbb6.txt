Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of acid-base chemistry. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem states: 0.25 mol of a weak, monoprotic acid is dissolved in 0.25 L of distilled water. The pH was measured as 4.26. I need to find the pKa of this weak acid from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that for weak acids, we can't just use the simple formula like pH = -log[concentration], because weak acids don't fully dissociate. So I think the approach here is to use the formula related to the dissociation of a weak acid.

Wait, the acid is monoprotic, so it only donates one proton. That simplifies things a bit. The general formula for a weak acid HA dissociating in water is HA ⇌ H+ + A-. The expression for Ka is [H+][A-]/[HA].

Since the acid is weak, the concentration of H+ ions won't be equal to the initial concentration of the acid. The initial concentration here is 0.25 mol in 0.25 L, so the initial concentration is 1 M (because moles divided by liters gives molarity).

But because it's a weak acid, the H+ concentration is much lower. The pH is given as 4.26, so the [H+] would be 10^-4.26. Let me calculate that. 4.26 is about 10^-4 is 0.0001, so 10^-4.26 would be a bit less. Maybe approximately 5.5 x 10^-5 M? Let me check: 10^-4 is 1e-4, 10^-4.26 is 1e-4.26 ≈ 5.5e-5. Hmm, or wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately.

Wait, another approach: since pH = -log[H+], then [H+] = 10^(-pH) = 10^(-4.26). Let me compute that. 10^-4 is 0.0001, 10^-0.26 is about 0.548, so 0.0001 * 0.548 ≈ 5.48e-5 M.

So [H+] is approximately 5.48e-5 M.

Now, considering the dissociation of the acid HA:

HA → H+ + A-

The initial concentration of HA is 1 M. Let's let x be the concentration of H+ produced. Because the acid is weak, x will be much smaller than 1, so we can approximate 1 - x ≈ 1.

So the expression for Ka becomes:

Ka = (x)(x) / (1) = x².

Wait, but wait, is that correct? Because for every mole of HA that dissociates, we get one mole of H+ and one mole of A-. So yes, the concentration of H+ is x, A- is x, and HA is approximately 1 - x ≈ 1.

So Ka ≈ x².

But wait, in this case, x is [H+] = 5.48e-5 M. So Ka is (5.48e-5)^2. Let's compute that.

(5.48e-5)^2 = (5.48)^2 * 1e-10. 5.48 squared is about 30 (since 5^2 is 25, 5.5^2 is 30.25, so 5.48^2 is around 30). So 30e-10 is 3e-9.

Wait, more accurately: 5.48 squared. Let's compute 5.48 *5.48. 5*5=25, 5*0.48=2.4, 0.48*5=2.4, 0.48*0.48=0.2304. Wait, maybe using (a+b)^2 formula where a=5, b=0.48.

(a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b².

a² =25, 2ab=2*5*0.48=4.8, b²=(0.48)^2=0.2304.

So 25 +4.8=29.8 +0.2304=30.0304.

So 5.48^2=30.0304. So (5.48e-5)^2 =30.0304e-10 = 3.00304e-9.

So Ka is approximately 3.003e-9.

Wait, but wait a second. Is this the right approach? Because for weak acids, when the dissociation is small, x is much less than initial concentration, so 1 - x ≈1. So the approximation holds. But what if the 5% rule applies? Let me check: x is 5.48e-5, initial concentration is 1 M. 5.48e-5 is 0.00548% of 1, which is way less than 5%, so the approximation is valid.

So Ka = x² = (5.48e-5)^2 ≈3e-9.

Then pKa is -log(Ka). So pKa = -log(3e-9).

Compute log(3e-9) = log(3) + log(1e-9) = 0.4771 -9 = -8.5229.

So pKa is 8.5229?

Wait, wait no, wait. Because pKa is -log(Ka), and Ka is 3e-9. So pKa = -log(3e-9) = 8.5228 approximately.

Wait, wait, no, that can't be right. Because if the pH is 4.26, and for a weak acid, the pKa is usually not that far from the pH. Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait another way to think about this. For a weak acid, when it's in solution, the concentration of H+ is much less than the initial concentration. So the HA dissociates a little bit, and the [H+] is x. So Ka is x^2 / (C - x), where C is the initial concentration.

Wait, but if x is much smaller than C, then C - x ≈ C. So Ka ≈ x² / C.

Wait, wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because in the expression, Ka is [H+][A-]/[HA]. Here, [H+] = x, [A-] = x, and [HA] = 1 - x.

If x is small, then [HA] ≈1, so Ka ≈ x² / 1 = x². So my initial approach was correct, and I shouldn't have said Ka = x² / C. Because C is 1, so that's the same as x².

Wait, but in that case, with x=5.48e-5, then Ka is (5.48e-5)^2 = approx 3e-9. So pKa is about 8.52.

Looking at the options, option J is 8.52. Option E is 10.52, which seems too high. Option B is 3.66, which is lower than the pH, which wouldn't make sense for a weak acid.

Wait, wait, but wait another thing: for a weak acid, the pH is less than pKa. Because in a weak acid solution, the [H+] is less than what it would be if the acid were strong. So for a solution of a weak acid, pH < pKa.

Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, wait. When a weak acid is in solution, the pH is less than what it would be for a strong acid of the same concentration, but how does it compare to pKa?

Wait, let me think: weak acid solution, pH is less than pKa? No, that can't be. Let's see, take acetic acid, which has a pKa around 4.76. A 1 M solution of acetic acid has a pH around 2.4, which is lower than pKa. Oh wait, that's right. So for a weak acid, the pH of the solution is less than the pKa.

So in this problem, the pH is 4.26. So the pKa must be higher than 4.26.

Looking back, I calculated pKa as about 8.52. So option J is 8.52, which is higher than pH.

So that would make sense.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because some sources say that for weak acids, when you have a weak acid solution, the pH is less than pKa, which aligns with what I just thought. So in this case, pH is 4.26, so pKa must be higher than that.

So among the options, the possible pKa values higher than 4.26 are options B (3.66 is lower, so no), E (10.52), F (7.52), G (6.52), H (7.26), I (5.26), J (8.52), etc.

Wait, my calculation gave pKa as 8.52, which is option J. That would make sense.

Another way to check: using the formula for weak acids. The pH of a weak acid can be found using the approximation:

pH = 1/2 (pKa - log C)

Wait, no, that's the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation for a buffer solution. Hmm, perhaps another approach.

Alternatively, the formula for a weak acid HA dissociating in water is:

[H+] = sqrt( Ka * C )

Where C is the concentration. So [H+]^2 = Ka * C.

So Ka = [H+]^2 / C.

Wait, because [H+] is x, and if C is the initial concentration (1 M), then Ka = x² / (1 - x) ≈ x² because x is small.

So yeah, that brings me back to Ka = x².

So plugging in [H+] = 5.48e-5 M, Ka is approx (5.48e-5)^2 = 3e-9. So pKa is log(1/(3e-9)).

Wait, no, pKa is -log(3e-9) = 8.5228.

So the correct answer is J: 8.52.

But wait, let me double-check the calculation. Let me compute [H+] correctly. pH is 4.26, so [H+] = 10^-4.26.

Let me compute 10^-4.26 precisely. Let me break it down:

4.26 = 4 + 0.26.

10^-4 = 1e-4 = 0.0001.

10^-0.26: Let's compute log(10^-0.26) = -0.26.

Wait, 10^0.26 is approximately, since 10^0.3 is about 2 (since 10^0.3 ≈ 2), because 10^0.3010 = 2.

Wait, 0.26 is close to 0.3. Let me compute 10^0.26.

Using logarithm tables or approximations: 10^0.26.

We can remember that ln(10^0.26) = 0.26 * ln(10) ≈ 0.26 * 2.3026 ≈ 0.5987.

e^0.5987 ≈ 1.819. So 10^0.26 ≈ 1.819.

Therefore, 10^-0.26 ≈ 1/1.819 ≈ 0.55.

So 10^-4.26 = 10^-4 * 10^-0.26 ≈ 0.0001 * 0.55 = 5.5e-5 M.

So that's correct.

So [H+] = 5.5e-5 M.

Then, Ka = (5.5e-5)^2 = (5.5)^2 * 1e-10.

5.5 squared is 30.25.

So Ka = 30.25e-10 = 3.025e-9.

Then, pKa = -log(3.025e-9) = ?

Log(3.025e-9) = log(3.025) + log(1e-9) = 0.4819 + (-9) = -8.5181.

So pKa = 8.5181, which is approximately 8.52. So option J is correct.
</think>

To determine the pKa of the weak, monoprotic acid, we start with the given data:

- **Initial concentration of the acid**: \( C = \frac{0.25 \, \text{mol}}{0.25 \, \text{L}} = 1 \, \text{M} \)
- **pH of the solution**: \( 4.26 \)
- **Relationship between pH and [H\(^+\)]**: \( [\text{H}^+] = 10^{-\text{pH}} = 10^{-4.26} \).

### Step 1: Calculate [H\(^+\)]
Using \( \text{pH} = 4.26 \), we calculate:
\[
[\text{H}^+] = 10^{-4.26} = 10^{-4} \cdot 10^{-0.26} \approx 0.0001 \cdot 0.55 = 5.5 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M}.
\]

### Step 2: Use the weak acid approximation
For a weak acid, the dissociation equilibrium is:
\[
\text{HA} \leftrightharpoons \text{H}^+ + \text{A}^-.
\]
Let \( x \) represent the concentration of \( \text{H}^+ \) produced. Since the acid is weak, \( x \ll C \), so \( [\text{HA}] \approx 1 \, \text{M} \). The expression for the acid dissociation constant \( K_a \) is:
\[
K_a = \frac{[\text{H}^+][\text{A}^-]}{[\text{HA}]} = \frac{x^2}{1} = x^2.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( K_a \)
Substituting \( x = [\text{H}^+] = 5.5 \times 10^{-5} \):
\[
K_a = (5.5 \times 10^{-5})^2 = 30.25 \times 10^{-10} = 3.025 \times 10^{-9}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate pKa
The relationship between \( K_a \) and \( \text{pKa} \) is:
\[
\text{pKa} = -\log(K_a).
\]
Substituting \( K_a = 3.025 \times 10^{-9} \):
\[
\text{pKa} = -\log(3.025 \times 10^{-9}) = -(\log(3.025) + \log(10^{-9})) = -(0.4819 - 9) = 8.5181.
\]

### Step 5: Match with the closest option
The calculated \( \text{pKa} \approx 8.52 \), which corresponds to **option J**.

### Final Answer:
J
