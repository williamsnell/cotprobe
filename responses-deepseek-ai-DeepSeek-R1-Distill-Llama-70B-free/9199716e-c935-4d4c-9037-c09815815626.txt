Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to approach it. Let me read it again.

The question says that a chemical reaction happens in a container with a cross-sectional area of 100 cm². As a result, a piston is pushed out through 10 cm against an external pressure of 1.0 atm. I need to calculate the work done by the system. The options are given from A to J.

Hmm, right. Work done by the system in expansion against an external pressure. I remember that work, in thermodynamics, is calculated using pressure and volume change. Oh wait, but when the system does work on the surroundings, like pushing a piston, the work is negative from the system's perspective because the system is losing energy.

Wait, so the formula for work done by the system is w = -P_ext * ΔV. Or is it the other way around? Let me think. Oh yeah, when the system expands against an external pressure, the work done by the system is negative because it's losing energy. So the formula is w = -P_ext * ΔV. But wait, another way I remember it is w = -PΔV, where P is the external pressure. So yeah, that makes sense.

So, I need to find the change in volume. The container's cross-sectional area is given, and the piston moves a certain distance. Since the area is in cm² and the distance is in cm, I can calculate the volume change.

Area (A) is 100 cm², and the distance (d) moved is 10 cm. So ΔV is A * d. But wait, units! Because standard SI units are in meters and cubic meters. So I need to convert cm to m.

100 cm² is (1 m² / (100 cm/m)^2) )? Wait, 1 m is 100 cm, so 1 cm is 0.01 m. So 100 cm² is (0.01 m)^2 * 100? No, wait. Wait, 1 cm² is (0.01 m)^2 = 1e-4 m². So 100 cm² is 100 * 1e-4 m² = 0.01 m².

Similarly, the distance moved is 10 cm, which is 0.1 meters.

So ΔV = A * d. So 0.01 m² * 0.1 m = 0.001 m³.

Wait, wait, 0.01 m² times 0.1 m is 0.001 m³. That's the volume change, right. Because volume is area times height (or distance moved here).

Now, the external pressure is 1.0 atm. I need to convert that to Pascals because the standard unit for pressure in SI is Pascals (Pa). I remember that 1 atm is 101325 Pa.

So P_ext is 101325 Pa.

Now, plug everything into the work formula. So w = - P_ext * ΔV.

Calculating that: 101325 Pa * 0.001 m³ = 101.325 J. Then multiply by -1 because work done by the system is negative.

Wait, wait. Wait a second. Wait, wait, wait. Let me make sure. The system is expanding, so the work should be negative, meaning the system is doing work on the surroundings, losing energy. So yes, the formula gives a negative value.

So 101325 * 0.001 = 101.325 J. But wait, wait, 1 atm is 101325 Pa, so 1 atm * 1 m³ is 101325 J. But here, the volume is 0.001 m³, so 101325 * 0.001 is 101.325 J.

Wait, but wait, that would be about 101 J. But looking at the options, the closest one is option A: -2e2 J, which is -200 J. Wait, 101 is about 1e2, so maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the unit conversions. Let me double-check.

Cross-sectional area is 100 cm². So 100 cm² is (100) * (1 cm)^2. 1 cm is 0.01 m, so 1 cm² is (0.01 m)^2 = 1e-4 m². So 100 cm² is 100 * 1e-4 m² = 0.01 m². That's correct.

The distance is 10 cm, which is 0.1 m. So ΔV is 0.01 m² * 0.1 m = 0.001 m³. Correct.

Pressure is 1 atm = 101325 Pa.

So P_ext * ΔV is 101325 * 0.001 = 101.325 J. So the work is -101.325 J. But looking at the options, none of them exactly match 101 J. The options are 1e2, 2e2, etc. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

A: -2.0e2 J (which is -200 J)

B: -3e2 J (-300 J)

C: -1.5e2 (-150 J)

D: 0.5e2 (50 J)

E: -0.5e2 (-50 J)

F: 2e2 (200 J)

G: -1e2 (-100 J)

H: -4e2 (-400 J)

I: 1.5e2 (150 J)

J:3e2 (300 J)

Hmm. So 101 J is closest to 1e2 (100 J). Option G is -1e2 J.

Wait, but I calculated -101.325 J, which is approximately -1.0e2 J. So the correct answer should be option G.

Wait a moment, wait, but when I calculated the work, I got approximately -101 J. So that would align with option G, which is -1.0e2 J. 

Wait, but let me think again. Are we sure about the sign? Because when the system does work on the surroundings, the work is negative. So in this case, the piston is pushed out, meaning the system is doing work, so w is negative. So yes, the calculation is correct.

Alternatively, sometimes I might get confused whether to use P external or internal. Oh wait, yes, for expansion work against a constant external pressure, the formula is w = -P_ext * ΔV. So I think that's correct.

So the answer should be approximately -100 J, which is option G.

To calculate the work done by the system, we use the formula for expansion work:

\[
w = -P_{\text{ext}} \Delta V
\]

### Step 1: Determine the change in volume (\(\Delta V\))
The cross-sectional area of the container is \(100 \, \text{cm}^2\), and the piston moves a distance of \(10 \, \text{cm}\). First, convert these values to SI units:

- \(1 \, \text{cm} = 0.01 \, \text{m}\), so \(100 \, \text{cm}^2 = 100 \times (0.01 \, \text{m})^2 = 0.01 \, \text{m}^2\).
- \(10 \, \text{cm} = 0.1 \, \text{m}\).

The change in volume is:

\[
\Delta V = \text{Area} \times \text{Distance} = 0.01 \, \text{m}^2 \times 0.1 \, \text{m} = 0.001 \, \text{m}^3
\]

### Step 2: Convert external pressure to SI units
The external pressure is given as \(1.0 \, \text{atm}\). Since \(1 \, \text{atm} = 101325 \, \text{Pa}\), we have:

\[
P_{\text{ext}} = 101325 \, \text{Pa}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the work done
Substitute the values into the formula:

\[
w = -P_{\text{ext}} \Delta V = -(101325 \, \text{Pa}) (0.001 \, \text{m}^3) = -101.325 \, \text{J}
\]

### Step 4: Match the result to the closest option
The calculated work is approximately \(-101 \, \text{J}\), which is closest to \(-1.0 \times 10^2 \, \text{J}\). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**G: \(-1.0 \times 10^2 \, \text{J}\)**.
