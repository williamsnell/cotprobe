Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with my understanding of these concepts, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read it again.

The question is about the yellow light from a sodium lamp with an average wavelength of 5890 Angstroms. I need to calculate the energy in electron volts (eV) for part (a) and in kilocalories per mole for part (b). The options are from A to J, each with specific values for both parts. My goal is to figure out which option is correct.

Alright, so I remember that the energy of a photon can be calculated using the equation E = hc/λ. Where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength. But wait, I need to make sure I use the right units here.

First, the wavelength is given in Angstroms. I should convert that to meters because the standard units for these constants are in meters. Oh right, 1 Angstrom is 1e-10 meters. So 5890 Angstroms is 5890e-10 m, which is 5.89e-7 meters. Let me write that down: λ = 5.89e-7 m.

Next, I think about Planck's constant, h. If I remember correctly, h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 Joule-seconds. And the speed of light, c, is about 3.0e8 meters per second. So putting those into the equation should give me the energy in Joules per photon.

Let me compute E in Joules. So E = (6.626e-34 Js * 3.0e8 m/s) / (5.89e-7 m). Let me compute the numerator first: 6.626e-34 * 3.0e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Then divide by 5.89e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 5.89e-7 ≈ 3.375e-19 Joules per photon.

Wait, that seems a bit small, but I think that's right. Now, I need to convert this energy from Joules to electron volts because part (a) asks for eV. I remember that 1 eV is approximately 1.602e-19 Joules. So to find out how many eV this is, I can divide the energy in Joules by the value of 1 eV in Joules.

So E = 3.375e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV. Let's calculate that: 3.375 / 1.602 ≈ 2.106 eV. Hmm, rounding that, it's approximately 2.11 eV. Let me check the options. Looking at the options, option C is (a) 2.1 eV, which is very close to my calculation. Option I is 1.9, which is a bit lower. So I think that's good for part (a).

Wait, but maybe I should double-check my calculations. Let me recalculate E in Joules. h is 6.626e-34, c is 3e8. Multiply them: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Dividing by λ, which is 5.89e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 / 5.89e-7. Let me compute that division. 1.9878e-25 divided by 5.89e-7 equals approximately 3.375e-19 J. That's correct.

Then, converting to eV: 3.375e-19 / 1.602e-19. Let's compute 3.375 / 1.602. 1.602 * 2 = 3.204, which is less than 3.375. 3.375-3.204 is 0.171. 0.171 /1.602 ≈ 0.106. So total is 2.106 eV, which rounds to about 2.11 eV. So part (a) is approximately 2.1 eV. So the closest option is C: 2.1 eV.

Now, part (b) asks for the energy in kilocalories per mole. Hmm, okay, so I need to find the energy per mole of photons. So first, I'll find the energy per photon in eV, which I already have as ~2.1 eV. But then I need to scale that up to per mole.

Wait, but another approach is to use the energy per photon in Joules, then multiply by Avogadro's number to get per mole, and then convert that to kilocalories.

So, each photon has energy E = 3.375e-19 J. So per mole, which is 6.022e23 photons, the energy would be E_mole = E * Avogadro's number. So 3.375e-19 J/photon * 6.022e23 photons/mol = Let's compute that.

3.375e-19 * 6.022e23 = (3.375 * 6.022) * 1e4. 3.375 * 6 is 20.25, 3.375 * 0.022 is about 0.07425, so total is approximately 20.32425. So 20.32425 * 1e4 = 2.032425e5 J/mol.

Wait, 3.375e-19 * 6.022e23 equals (3.375 * 6.022) * 1e( (-19) +23 ) = 20.324 * 1e4 = 2.0324e5 J/mol.

Now, convert Joules to kilocalories. I remember that 1 calorie is approximately 4.184 Joules. So 1 kilocalorie is 1000 calories, which is 4184 Joules.

So E (kcal/mol) = (2.0324e5 J/mol) / (4184 J/kcal) = Let's compute that.

2.0324e5 / 4184 ≈ Let me compute 2e5 is 200,000. 200,000 / 4184 is approx 47.75. Wait, because 4184 *47 = 4184*40=167,360; 4184*7=29,288. So 167360 +29288=196,648. That's 47 times. 4184*48 = 196,648 +4184=200,832. Oh wait, 2.0324e5 is 203,240. So 4184 *48 = 200,832. 203,240 -200,832 = 2,408. So 48 + (2408/4184) ≈48 + 0.576 ≈48.576. So approximately 48.58 kcal/mol.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute it more accurately. 2.0324e5 is 203,240 J/mol.

So 203240 / 4184 = Let's divide 203240 by 4184.

Alternatively, 4184 * 48 = 200,832 as before. Subtracting that from 203,240 gives 2,408. So 2,408 / 4184 = approximately 0.575. So 48.575, which is about 48.58 kcal/mol.

Wait, but looking at the options, option C for part (b) is 48.4 Kcal/mol. Hmm, my calculation gives about 48.58, which is close to 48.4 but not exact. Let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial Joules calculation. Let me go back.

Photon energy: E = hc/λ. h=6.626e-34, c=3e8, λ=5.89e-7 m.

E = (6.626e-34 *3e8) / 5.89e-7.

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by 5.89e-7 m: 1.9878e-25 /5.89e-7 = (1.9878 /5.89 )e-18.

1.9878 /5.89 ≈ 0.3375. So E ≈0.3375e-18 J, which is 3.375e-19 J. That part is correct.

Then, per mole: 3.375e-19 J *6.022e23 = 3.375 *6.022 *1e4.

3.375 *6 =20.25, 3.375 *0.022=0.07425. So total 20.32425 *1e4=2.032425e5 J/mol. That's 203,242.5 J/mol.

Convert to kcal: 203242.5 J /4184 J/kcal = approx 48.58 kcal/mol.

Wait, but the option C says 48.4 kcal/mol, which is a little lower. Hmm, perhaps I made a slight error earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate this more precisely. Let me try using exact numbers.

E per photon in J: (6.62607015e-34 J·s) * (299792458 m/s) / (5890e-10 m).

Wait, maybe I approximated c as 3e8, but the exact value is 299,792,458 m/s. Let's use more precise numbers.

So, let me recalculate E.

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s

c = 299792458 m/s

λ =5890 Å =5890e-10 m =5.89e-7 m.

E = h*c / λ.

So E = (6.62607015e-34 * 299792458) / 5.89e-7.

Compute numerator: 6.62607015e-34 * 299792458.

Let me compute that: 6.62607015e-34 * 2.99792458e8 = 

Multiply 6.62607015 by 2.99792458 first.

6.62607 *3 is about 19.878, but precise calculation:

6.62607015 *2.99792458 = let's compute:

6 * 2.9979 = 17.9874.

0.62607 *2.9979 ≈ 1.876.

So total ≈17.9874 +1.876≈19.8634.

So 19.8634e-34+8 = 19.8634e-26 J·m.

Wait, no, the exponents: 1e-34 *1e8 =1e-26. So 19.8634e-26 J·m.

Then, divide by λ: 5.89e-7 m.

So E = (19.8634e-26 J·m) / (5.89e-7 m) = (19.8634 /5.89 )e-19 J.

19.8634 /5.89 ≈3.375. So E ≈3.375e-19 J, same as before.

So per photon, same as before. Then per mole, same as before, leading to about 48.58 kcal/mol.

But option C says 48.4. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the conversion factor from J to kcal.

Wait, 1 kcal is 4184 J exactly? I think sometimes it's taken as 4.184 x10^3 J, which would make 1 kcal =4184 J. So 1 J = 1/4184 kcal.

So 203,242.5 J is 203242.5 /4184 kcal.

Let me compute that more accurately:

4184 *48 = 200,832.

203242.5 -200,832=2,410.5.

2,410.5 /4184 = approx 0.576.

So 48.576 kcal/mol, which is 48.58, approximately 48.6.

But none of the options have exactly that. Looking at the options:

Option C: (a)2.1, (b)48.4

Option I: (a)1.9, (b)43.8

Option H: (a)2.3, (b)53.2

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of energy per mole. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe I should use a different approach for part (b). Since I have the energy per photon in eV, perhaps I can calculate the energy per mole using eV directly.

I remember that 1 eV per photon is equal to 96.485 kJ/mol. Because 1 eV =1.602e-19 J, and per mole, it's 1.602e-19 *6.022e23 = 96.485e3 J/mol, which is 96.485 kJ/mol.

So if each photon is 2.106 eV, then per mole, it's 2.106 *96.485 kJ/mol.

Compute that: 2.106 *96.485.

2 *96.485 =192.97

0.106 *96.485≈10.225.

So total is approximately 203.195 kJ/mol.

Convert that to kcal: since 1 kJ is 0.239 kcal (because 1 kcal=4184 J, 1 kJ=1000 J → 1000/4184≈0.239).

So 203.195 kJ *0.239 kcal/kJ ≈48.56 kcal/mol.

Again, about 48.56, same as before. So why does option C say 48.4?

Hmm, perhaps there's a mistake in the calculation steps. Let's try another approach.

Wait, another way to find energy per mole is to use the relation E = (hc/(λ)) * (N_A)/e, where N_A is Avogadro's number and e is the elementary charge.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the conversion factor. Wait, 1 eV = 1.602e-19 J. So 1 eV per photon is 1.602e-19 J *6.022e23 =96.485e3 J/mol, which is 96.485 kJ/mol. So yes, that's correct.

So 2.106 eV *96.485 kJ/mol per eV = 2.106 *96.485 = approx 203.195 kJ/mol → 48.56 kcal/mol.

Hmm, but option C gives 48.4. So why the discrepancy? Maybe I need to use more precise values.

Wait, let me calculate 2.106 *96.485 more precisely.

2.106 *96.485 = ?

Let me break it down:

= 2 *96.485 + 0.1 *96.485 + 0.006 *96.485

= 192.97 + 9.6485 + 0.57891

= 192.97 +9.6485=202.6185 +0.57891≈203.1974 kJ/mol.

Convert to kcal: 203.1974 *0.239 = ?

200 *0.239=47.8

3.1974 *0.239≈0.764.

So total≈47.8+0.764=48.564 kcal/mol.

So approximately 48.56 kcal/mol.

But the closest option is C:48.4. Hmm, that's a bit off. Let me look at the options again.

Looking at option C: (a)2.1 eV and (b)48.4 Kcal/mol.

But according to my calculation, it's about 48.56, so 48.6. None of the options give exactly that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial eV calculation.

Wait, wait. Let me recalculate the eV part again. Maybe I made an error there.

Photon energy E = hc/(λ).

h=6.626e-34 Js

c=3e8 m/s

λ=5.89e-7 m.

E=(6.626e-34 *3e8)/5.89e-7 = (1.9878e-25) /5.89e-7 = approx 3.375e-19 J.

Yes, same as before.

Convert to eV: 3.375e-19 /1.602e-19 = approx 2.106 eV. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the given wavelength is 5890 Å, which is 589 nm. Wait, no, 1 nm is 10 Angstroms, so 5890 Å is 589.0 nm. Wait, no, 1 Angstrom is 0.1 nm. So 5890 Angstroms is 589.0 nm. Hmm, but wait, sodium light is typically around 589 nm, which is about 5890 Angstroms. So that's correct.

So, the calculations seem correct. So perhaps the answer is supposed to be option C, even though the calculation is 48.56, which is 48.6, but option C is 48.4. Wait, perhaps I should check the exact value of Avogadro's number or the conversion factors.

Wait, Avogadro's number is 6.02214076e23 mol⁻¹. So, using exact value might change it slightly.

Let me compute E per mole in J again.

E (J) = 3.375e-19 J/photon *6.02214076e23 photons/mol.

3.375e-19 *6.02214076e23 =3.375 *6.02214076 *1e4.

3.375 *6.02214076=?

Let me compute 3 *6.02214=18.06642, 0.375 *6.02214=2.2582925. So total is 18.06642 +2.2582925=20.3247125. So 20.3247125e4 J/mol=2.03247125e5 J/mol=203247.125 J/mol.

Convert to kcal: 203247.125 J /4184 J/kcal = 48.576 kcal/mol.

Hmm, that's even more precise. So 48.576, which is about 48.58.

Looking back at the options, the closest is option C:48.4, but that's 0.17 off. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial eV calculation.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the energy using another formula. Alternatively
