Question:

A shop owner domiciled in State A sued a distributor in a federal district court in State A for breach of a contract. The shop owner sought $100,000 in damages for allegedly defective goods that the distributor had provided under the contract. The distributor is incorporated in State B, with its principal place of business in State C. The distributor brought in as a third-party defendant the wholesaler that had provided the goods to the distributor, alleging that the wholesaler had a duty to indemnify the distributor for any damages recovered by the shop owner. The wholesaler is incorporated in State B, with its principal place of business in State A. The wholesaler has asserted a $60,000 counterclaim against the distributor for payment for the goods at issue, and the distributor has moved to dismiss the counterclaim for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Should the motion to dismiss be granted?

Options:

A: No, because the distributor and the wholesaler conduct business in different states.
B: Yes, because there is no diversity of citizenship between the distributor and the wholesaler.
C: Yes, because the wholesaler's counterclaim is not directly related to the distributor's claim.
D: No, because the wholesaler's and the distributor's principal places of business are diverse.
E: No, because the distributor has invoked the jurisdiction of the court.
F: Yes, because the wholesaler's counterclaim is not a compulsory counterclaim.
G: No, because the wholesaler and distributor are incorporated in the same state.
H: No, because there is supplemental jurisdiction over the wholesaler's counterclaim.
I: Yes, because there is no diversity of citizenship between the shop owner and the wholesaler.

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about federal jurisdiction, specifically regarding a motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the scenario: A shop owner in State A sued a distributor in federal court in State A for breach of contract, seeking $100k in damages. The distributor is incorporated in State B, with its principal place of business in State C. So, the shop owner (plaintiff) and the distributor (defendant) are diverse because they're from different states. That gives the federal court diversity jurisdiction over the original claim, assuming the amount in controversy is met, which it is ($100k).

Now, the distributor brings in a third-party defendant, the wholesaler, claiming the wholesaler should indemnify them for any damages recovered by the shop owner. The wholesaler is incorporated in State B and has its principal place of business in State A. So, the wholesaler is from State B (incorporation) but operates mainly in State A. 

The wholesaler has a $60k counterclaim against the distributor for payment of the goods. The distributor moves to dismiss this counterclaim, arguing lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. I need to determine if the motion should be granted.

The key here is whether the court has jurisdiction over the wholesaler's counterclaim. The original suit is based on diversity jurisdiction because the plaintiff (State A) and defendant (State C, since principal place is usually determinative for citizenship) are diverse. But when a third party is brought in, we have to look at the jurisdiction for that third-party claim.

The wholesaler's counterclaim is against the distributor. So, the court's jurisdiction over this counterclaim could be based on either diversity or supplemental jurisdiction.

Diversity would require that the wholesaler and distributor are citizens of different states. Let's check their citizenship. The distributor is incorporated in State B and has its principal place in State C, so its citizenship is State B and State C. The wholesaler is incorporated in State B and has its principal place in State A. So, for diversity purposes, the wholesaler's citizenship is State B (incorporation) and State A (principal place). The distributor is State B and C. So, do they share any state of citizenship? Both are citizens of State B. Because the wholesaler is incorporated there, and the distributor is also incorporated in State B. So, both are citizens of State B. Therefore, there's no diversity between them because they share State B citizenship.

Wait, but wait. The test for corporate citizenship is that a corporation is a citizen of every state where it is incorporated and the state where it has its principal place of business. So, the distributor is a citizen of State B (incorporation) and State C (principal place). The wholesaler is a citizen of State B (incorporation) and State A (principal place). So, the distributor and wholesaler share State B citizenship. Therefore, there's no diversity between them because for diversity jurisdiction, all plaintiffs must be diverse from all defendants. Here, both are from State B. So, diversity jurisdiction doesn't apply between them.

Now, the other possibility is supplemental jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1367. Supplemental jurisdiction applies to claims that are part of the same case or controversy as the original claim, but only if the original claim is supported by jurisdiction (which it is, diversity). However, the counterclaim here is by the wholesaler against the distributor. But wait, the wholesaler is the third-party defendant, and the counterclaim is against the original defendant (distributor). 

Wait, but let me think. When a third-party defendant (wholesaler) brings a counterclaim against the third-party plaintiff (distributor), is that claim part of the same case or controversy? Or is it a separate claim that might not necessarily be so closely related?

Alternatively, maybe the court can exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the counterclaim if it arises out of the same transaction or occurrence. Let's see: the counterclaim is for payment of the goods, which are the same goods that are defective and part of the original breach of contract claim. So, it's related. Therefore, the court might have supplemental jurisdiction over it.

Wait, but wait again. The counterclaim is for payment, so it's about the contract between the distributor and wholesaler. The original claim is about the contract between the shop owner and the distributor. So, same transaction? Maybe, because the goods are the same. So, perhaps the counterclaim is sufficiently related.

But the key issue is whether the court can assert jurisdiction over the counterclaim. Since the original claim is in federal court based on diversity, and the counterclaim arises from the same transaction, the court can exercise supplemental jurisdiction, even if diversity is lacking between the wholesaler and the distributor.

Wait, but the counterclaim is by the wholesaler against the distributor. So, the court's jurisdiction over this claim would depend on either diversity between them or supplemental jurisdiction.

Since diversity doesn't exist (both are citizens of State B), but the claim arises from the same transaction as the original claim, the court can exercise supplemental jurisdiction.

But wait, no. Wait, the original claim is between the shop owner (State A) and the distributor (State B and C). The counterclaim is between the wholesaler (State B and A) and the distributor (State B and C). So, the counterclaim is between two parties where both have State B citizenship. So, no diversity, but is it part of the same case or controversy? 

Yes, because the wholesaler's liability to indemnify the distributor arises from the same contract as the original dispute. Therefore, the counterclaim is part of the same controversy. So, the court can exercise supplemental jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1367(a), which allows for jurisdiction over claims that are part of the same case or controversy, even if standing alone they don't meet diversity requirements.

So, the motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction should not be granted because the court has supplemental jurisdiction over the counterclaim.

Looking at the options:

Option H: No, because there is supplemental jurisdiction over the wholesaler's counterclaim. That seems correct.

Other options:

A: No, because distributor and wholesaler conduct business in different states. Not relevant; it's about citizenship, not where they do business generally.

B: Yes, because no diversity. But if there's supplemental jurisdiction, the answer would be no, so B is incorrect.

C: Yes, because not directly related. But it is directly related to the same transaction, so C is wrong.

D: No, because principal places are diverse. Wait, distributor's principal place is State C, wholesaler's is State A. So, their principal places are different. But for diversity, it's about all possible states of citizenship. Since both are citizens of State B, regardless of principal places, diversity is lacking. So D is incorrect because their principal places being diverse doesn't matter; they share State B citizenship.

E: No, because distributor invoked jurisdiction. Not sure what this means. Distributor is a defendant; they didn't invoke jurisdiction. Not relevant.

F: Yes, because not a compulsory counterclaim. Wait, is the counterclaim compulsory? A compulsory counterclaim is one that arises from the same transaction. Since the wholesaler's claim is for payment of the same goods, it's part of the same transaction. Therefore, it's a compulsory counterclaim. So F is wrong because it says the counterclaim is not compulsory, which is incorrect.

G: No, because incorporated in same state. They are both incorporated in State B, so they share citizenship. So G says no because they're in same state. But the answer is about jurisdiction. G is wrong because even though they are in same state, the court can have jurisdiction via supplemental.

H: Correct, as discussed.

I: Yes, because no diversity between shop owner and wholesaler. But the counterclaim is between wholesaler and distributor. The shop owner's citizenship is irrelevant to the counterclaim's jurisdiction. So I is wrong.

To determine whether the motion to dismiss the wholesaler's counterclaim for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction should be granted, the analysis focuses on whether the court has jurisdiction over the counterclaim. The original lawsuit is based on diversity jurisdiction, as the shop owner (State A) and the distributor (State B and State C) are citizens of different states, and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000.

The wholesaler, as a third-party defendant, has asserted a $60,000 counterclaim against the distributor for payment for the goods. The court's jurisdiction over this counterclaim could be based on either diversity jurisdiction or supplemental jurisdiction.

1. **Diversity Jurisdiction**:  
   - The distributor is a citizen of State B (incorporation) and State C (principal place of business).  
   - The wholesaler is a citizen of State B (incorporation) and State A (principal place of business).  
   - Since both the distributor and the wholesaler are citizens of State B, there is no diversity of citizenship between them. Therefore, diversity jurisdiction does not apply.

2. **Supplemental Jurisdiction**:  
   - Under 28 U.S.C. ยง 1367(a), federal courts may exercise supplemental jurisdiction over claims that are part of the same case or controversy as the original claim.  
   - The wholesaler's counterclaim arises from the same transaction as the original claim (the contract for the goods) and is therefore part of the same case or controversy.  
   - Since the original claim is supported by diversity jurisdiction, the court can exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the wholesaler's counterclaim, even though diversity jurisdiction is lacking between the distributor and the wholesaler.

Given that the court has supplemental jurisdiction over the wholesaler's counterclaim, the motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction should not be granted.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A**: Incorrect. The fact that the distributor and wholesaler conduct business in different states is irrelevant; jurisdiction depends on citizenship, not general business activity.  
- **B**: Incorrect. While there is no diversity of citizenship between the distributor and the wholesaler, the court can still exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the counterclaim.  
- **C**: Incorrect. The wholesaler's counterclaim is directly related to the same transaction as the original claim, so it is not unrelated.  
- **D**: Incorrect. Although the distributor's principal place of business is in State C and the wholesaler's is in State A, the lack of diversity jurisdiction is based on their shared citizenship in State B.  
- **E**: Incorrect. The distributor, as a defendant, did not "invoke the jurisdiction of the court" in a way that would affect jurisdiction over the counterclaim.  
- **F**: Incorrect. The wholesaler's counterclaim is a compulsory counterclaim because it arises from the same transaction as the distributor's claim.  
- **G**: Incorrect. While the distributor and wholesaler are both incorporated in State B, the court can still exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the counterclaim.  
- **H**: Correct. The court has supplemental jurisdiction over the wholesaler's counterclaim because it arises from the same transaction as the original claim.  
- **I**: Incorrect. The lack of diversity between the shop owner and the wholesaler is irrelevant to the jurisdiction over the counterclaim, which is between the wholesaler and the distributor.
