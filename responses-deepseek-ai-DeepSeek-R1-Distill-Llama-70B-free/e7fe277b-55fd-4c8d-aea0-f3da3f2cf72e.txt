Okay, so I've got this optics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand all the details.

The problem says that an object is placed 60 cm from a thick double convex lens. The lens has faces with radii of curvature of 20 cm and 30 cm. The thickness is 2 cm, and the index of refraction is 1.5. I need to find the position of the image. The options are given from A to J.

Hmm, right. I remember that for lenses, the lensmaker's formula is important. Oh wait, the standard lensmaker's equation is 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2), but wait, that's for a thin lens. Oh wait, but in this case, the lens is thick, so maybe I need to consider something else.

Wait, the thickness here is 2 cm. So the standard thin lens formula might not be accurate. I'm a bit fuzzy on how to handle thick lenses. Let me think. Oh right, for a thick lens, the effective focal length is calculated considering the thickness. So the formula for a thick lens is a bit different.

The formula for the focal length of a thick lens is 1/f = (n-1)[(1/R1) - (1/R2) + (d)/(n R1 R2)]}, or maybe I'm mixing something up. Alternatively, I remember there's another approach where you calculate the front and back focal lengths separately because the lens isn't thin.

Wait no, perhaps I should use the thick lens formula. The formula is 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2) - d/(n R1 R2 (n-1)), but I'm not too confident about that. Alternatively, maybe I should first compute the radii of curvature correctly.

Wait a minute, the lens is double convex, which means both R1 and R2 are positive because the lens is convex on both sides. So R1 is 20 cm and R2 is 30 cm. Or wait, sometimes the signs depend on the convention. Let me clarify: in the standard convention, for a double convex lens, R1 is positive and R2 is negative? No, wait, I think I might have that backward.

Wait no, the standard sign convention is that for a surface, if the center of curvature is to the right of the surface, the radius is positive. So for a double convex lens, the first surface (left side) has R1 positive because it's convex outward, and the second surface (right side) is also convex outward, so R2 is positive as well? Wait no, no. Let me think clearly.

Wait, when a lens is double convex, both surfaces are convex towards outside. So for the first surface, the center is on the right, so R1 is positive. For the second surface, the center is on the left, so R2 would be negative? Wait no, that can't be right. Because when the lens is double convex, each surface is convex outward. So the first surface is convex to the left (so its center is to the right, so R1 is positive), and the second surface is convex to the right (so its center is to the left, so R2 would be negative? Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait no, the standard is that for a double convex lens, the first surface is convex (so R1 is positive), and the second surface is also convex (so R2 is negative because the center is on the same side as the first surface). Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me just get the signs right.

In the lensmaker's formula, R1 is positive if the first surface is convex towards the incoming light (left side for a double convex lens), and R2 is negative if the second surface is convex towards the right (so R2 is negative). Wait, no, that might be the case for a plano-convex lens. For a double convex lens, both R1 and R2 are positive, but R2 is the radius after the lens, so maybe I should think of R2 as negative. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the correct signs for the lensmaker's equation. Oh wait, I can't actually look it up right now, so I'll have to rely on my memory. Let me try to recall: for a double convex lens, both R1 and R2 are positive in the formula. No, wait, no. Because in the formula, 1/f = (n-1)[1/R1 - 1/R2], so if the lens is double convex, R1 is positive, R2 is negative because the second surface is convex towards the right, so the radius is considered negative when using the formula.

Wait no, no. Let me think about a double convex lens: the first surface has radius R1, and because it's convex, the center of curvature is on the other side of the surface from the lens. So for the first surface, it's convex to the left, so R1 is positive. The second surface is convex to the right, so the center is to the left of that surface. So when considering the second surface, the radius is negative. So R2 would be negative.

Wait, no, that's not right. Because when using the lensmaker's equation, the formula is 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2). For a double convex lens, R1 is positive, and R2 is negative. Because the second surface is convex, so the radius is measured from that surface to the center of curvature, which is on the opposite side. So R2 would be negative. So R1 is positive, R2 is negative.

Wait, but in the problem, the lens has radii of curvature 20 cm and 30 cm. So R1 is 20 cm, positive, and R2 is 30 cm, but since it's convex on the other side, R2 is positive or negative? Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think differently: when the lens is double convex, both R1 and R2 are positive. No, that's not correct because the formula would give 1/f = (n-1)(1/20 - 1/30), which would be 1/f = (n-1)( (3-2)/(60) ) ) = (n-1)(1/60). So 1/f = 0.5 * (1/60) = 1/120, so f=120 cm. But wait, that can't be right because a 120 cm focal length seems too long for a 60 cm object distance, which would be within the focal length, implying a virtual image.

Wait, but if the object is placed at 60 cm, which is less than f=120 cm, then the image would be virtual and on the same side as the object. But I don't know if that's the case because I'm not sure if I'm using the correct signs for R1 and R2.

Alternatively, perhaps I should take R2 as negative. Let's say R1 is 20 cm, R2 is -30 cm. Then 1/f = (n-1)[1/R1 - 1/R2] = (0.5)[1/20 - (1/-30)] = 0.5 [ (3 + 2)/60 ) ] = 0.5*(5/60) = 0.5*(1/12) = 1/24. So f=24 cm. That makes more sense.

Wait, but then that would make the focal length positive, indicating a converging lens. So the object is at 60 cm, which is beyond 2f (since 2f would be 48 cm), so it's in the region where the image is real and inverted.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting confused because I'm not sure about the signs of R1 and R2. Let me try to clarify the sign convention again.

In the standard lensmaker's equation, for a lens in air:

1/f = (n - 1) [1/R1 - 1/R2 ]

The signs of R1 and R2 are determined by their orientation relative to the incoming light. For a double convex lens, the first surface (left) is convex, so R1 is positive. The second surface (right) is also convex, so when viewed from the right side, the center is on the left, so R2 is negative. So R2 is negative.

So in this case, R1 = +20 cm, R2 = -30 cm.

So plugging into the equation:

1/f = (1.5 - 1) [1/20 - (1/-30)] = 0.5 [ (1/20) + (1/30) ) ]

Compute 1/20 + 1/30. The common denominator is 60, so 3/60 + 2/60 = 5/60 = 1/12.

So 1/f = 0.5 * (1/12) = 1/24 â†’ f = 24 cm.

So the focal length is 24 cm.

Wait, but wait again. Oh right, but this is the thin lens approximation. The problem says it's a thick lens with a thickness of 2 cm. So the thin lens formula may not be accurate. I think the thick lens formula is a bit different. Oh wait, but I'm not entirely sure about how the thickness affects the focal length.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the thin lens formula despite the mention of thickness, maybe it's a red herring. Or perhaps the thickness is given to indicate that we need to adjust the calculation.

Wait, another approach: the thick lens can be treated as two surfaces, and the image is formed by considering each surface's contribution. So the lens is considered as two spherical surfaces separated by a distance d (the thickness). So the process would involve finding the image after the first surface, then using that image as the object for the second surface.

Yes, that makes sense. So first, find the image formed by the first surface (the left surface of the lens), then use that image as the object for the second surface (the right surface of the lens), taking into account the separation between the surfaces.

So let's proceed step by step.

First, consider the first surface (left surface): it's a convex spherical surface. The object is placed 60 cm in front of this surface.

Wait, the object is placed 60 cm from the lens, but since the lens is thick (2 cm), the first surface is 60 cm from the object, and the second surface is 2 cm behind the first.

Wait, no. The object is placed 60 cm from the lens. So the distance from the object to the first surface is 60 cm. Then the thickness is 2 cm, so the distance between the first and second surfaces is 2 cm.

But when considering the second surface, the object for that surface would be the image formed by the first surface, but adjusted for the distance between the surfaces.

Hmm, I think I can model each surface as a spherical mirror and compute the image step by step.

The formula for a single spherical surface is 1/f = (n2/n1 - 1) * (1/R), but wait, no: the formula is 1/do + 1/di = (n2/n1 - 1)(1/R), where do is the object distance, di is the image distance, R is the radius of curvature, n1 is the refractive index of the object medium, and n2 is that of the image medium.

Wait, yes, the formula is 1/do + 1/di = (n2/n1 - 1) (1/R), where R is positive if the surface is convex towards the incoming light.

Wait, let's get the signs right. For a surface, if the object is in medium 1 (n1) and the image is in medium 2 (n2), then:

If the surface is convex (center of curvature on the opposite side), then R is positive.

So for the first surface: it's the left surface of the lens, convex, so R is positive.

So for the first surface, the object is at do1 = 60 cm (since it's placed 60 cm from the lens, which is the first surface). n1 is air, so n1 = 1. n2 is glass, n2 = 1.5. R is 20 cm.

So the formula: 1/do + 1/di = (n2/n1 - 1)(1/R)

So substituting values:

1/60 + 1/di1 = (1.5/1 - 1)(1/20) = 0.5 * (1/20) = 1/40.

So 1/di1 = 1/40 - 1/60 = (3 - 2)/120 = 1/120 â†’ di1 = 120 cm.

Wait, that's the image distance from the first surface. So the image is formed 120 cm behind the first surface.

But wait, the lens is 2 cm thick, so the second surface is 2 cm behind the first. So the image formed by the first surface is at 120 cm from the first surface, which is 120 - 2 = 118 cm in front of the second surface.

Wait no, because the image is formed inside the glass, beyond the second surface. So the distance from the second surface to this image is di1 - d, where d is the thickness.

Wait, perhaps I should think of it this way: the image from the first surface is 120 cm from the first surface, which is on the same side as the second surface. So the distance from the second surface to this image would be 120 cm - 2 cm = 118 cm.

Wait, no, because the first surface is at position 0, the second surface is at position +2 cm. The image from the first surface is at +120 cm, so the distance from the second surface is 120 - 2 = 118 cm. But since the second surface is convex from the other side, the sign conventions might change.

Wait, but after the first surface, the light enters the glass. Now, the second surface is the right surface of the lens, which is convex towards the right, so when considering the second surface, the incoming light comes from the glass (n=1.5) and exits into air (n=1). So for the second surface, n1 = 1.5, n2 = 1. So the formula becomes:

1/do2 + 1/di2 = (n2/n1 - 1)(1/R2)

Where R2 is the radius of curvature of the second surface.

Wait, but the radius R2 is 30 cm. Now, the second surface is convex towards the right, which is the same side as the outgoing light. So from the perspective of the second surface, when light is traveling from glass to air, the surface is convex, so R is positive.

Wait, no. Wait, the sign convention for R when the light is going from glass to air: if the surface is convex toward the outgoing direction (right), then R is positive. Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the formula.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to remember that for a convex surface when the light is exiting into a lower refractive index, the radius is positive. So for the second surface, since it's convex towards the right, and light is exiting from glass (n=1.5) to air (n=1), R2 is positive.

Wait, but wait. The formula for a single surface when light is going from medium 1 to medium 2 is:

1/do + 1/di = (n2/n1 - 1) (1/R)

The sign of R is positive if the surface is convex towards the incoming light.

So for the second surface: the incoming light is from glass (n1=1.5) to air (n2=1). The surface is convex towards the right, which is the direction of the outgoing light. So from the incoming side (glass), the surface is concave, because it's convex to the other side. So R would be negative.

Wait, no. Let me visualize. The second surface: the lens is double convex, so from the outside, it's convex on both ends. So when looking at the second surface from the inside of the lens (glass side), the surface curves inward, making it concave. So for the second surface, R is negative.

Alternatively, perhaps when considering the second surface, the radius is negative because the center of curvature is on the same side as the incoming light (from the glass). So R would be negative.

So R2 is -30 cm.

So for the second surface: the object distance do2 is the distance from the second surface to the image formed by the first surface. Since the image from the first surface is at 120 cm from the first surface, and the second surface is 2 cm behind the first, the object distance for the second surface is 120 cm - 2 cm = 118 cm. But wait, in terms of sign conventions, the image from the first surface is on the opposite side of the second surface, so do2 is positive 118 cm.

Wait, wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me clarify: after the first surface, the image is formed 120 cm to the right of the first surface (since di1 was 120 cm, positive). The second surface is 2 cm to the right of the first surface. So the distance from the second surface to this image is 120 cm - 2 cm = 118 cm. So do2 is 118 cm.

Now, applying the formula for the second surface:

1/do2 + 1/di2 = (n2/n1 - 1) * (1/R2)

n1 = 1.5 (glass), n2 = 1 (air).

So (n2/n1 - 1) = (1/1.5) - 1 = (2/3) - 1 = -1/3.

R2 is -30 cm, so 1/R2 = -1/30.

Putting it all together:

1/118 + 1/di2 = (-1/3) * (-1/30) = (1/3)(1/30) = 1/90.

So 1/di2 = 1/90 - 1/118.

Compute 1/90 â‰ˆ 0.011111, 1/118 â‰ˆ 0.0084746.

So 0.011111 - 0.0084746 â‰ˆ 0.0026364.

1/di2 â‰ˆ 0.0026364 â†’ di2 â‰ˆ 1 / 0.0026364 â‰ˆ 379.31 cm.

Wait, so the image is formed about 379 cm to the right of the second surface.

But wait, that seems like a very long image distance. Let me check my calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign of R2. Let's see: the
