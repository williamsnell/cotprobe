Okay, so I have this question about the excavation of Yang-shao sites in China and which domesticated crops they indicate. I'm a bit rusty on my archaeology, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that Yang-shao is a Neolithic culture in China. The Yangshao culture is known for its painted pottery, but I'm more interested in their agriculture here. I think they were based in the Yellow River valley, which is a significant area for early Chinese civilization.

I recall that millet was a major crop in ancient China, especially during the Neolithic period. So maybe millet is one of the crops. I also remember that rice was domesticated in southern China, maybe in the Yangtze River area, which is a bit south of the Yang-shao sites. So perhaps Yang-shao people didn't grow rice as much, but I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: Yang-shao is part of the early farming communities in northern China. Millet, specifically, was a staple there. I think they cultivated both foxtail millet and broomcorn millet. So millet should definitely be one of the crops.

Looking at the options, let's go through them:

Option A: barley, lentils, peas. Barley is more associated with the Fertile Crescent, I think, like in Mesopotamia or Egypt. Not sure if Yang-shao used barley.

Option B: soybeans, emmer, rice. Emmer is a type of wheat, again from the Fertile Crescent. I'm not sure if emmer was in China that early. Soybeans are definitely from China, but were they domesticated by Yang-shao times?

Option C: millet, barley, maize. Millet fits, but barley again is maybe not. Maize is corn, which is from the Americas. Yang-shao is way before Columbus, so maize couldn't have been there. So option C is out because of maize.

Option D: wheat, rice, peas. Wheat could be possible, but I'm not sure if Yang-shao had wheat. Rice, as I thought earlier, might be more from southern regions.

Option E: rice, soybeans, maize. Again, maize is a problem here. So E is out.

Option F: sorghum, emmer, legumes. Sorghum is more of an African crop, I believe. Emmer again is from the Near East. Not sure about this.

Option G: maize, cabbage, peas. Maize is a no-go, so G is out.

Option H: wheat, barley, cabbage. Both wheat and barley are from elsewhere, so probably not.

Option I: millet, cabbage, rice. Millet is good, but I'm not sure about cabbage. Also, rice might not have been their main crop.

Option J: beans, millet, maize. Maize again is a problem. So J is out.

Wait, let me reconsider. I remember that the Yangshao culture was millet-based. So the correct option must include millet. Looking back, options C, I, and J include millet, but C and J have maize which is incorrect. So only option I and maybe another.

Wait, option B has soybeans. Did Yang-shao domesticate soybeans? I think soybeans were domesticated in China, but perhaps later. Yang-shao is around 5000-3000 BCE. I think soybean domestication happened around that time or maybe a bit later. So maybe B could be possible if it includes soybeans, but emmer and rice are questionable.

Wait, another angle: the Yangshao sites are associated with the earliest domestication of millet, and perhaps other crops like beans or vegetables. But I'm trying to recall if they had any other specific crops.

I think the main crops were millet and perhaps some legumes. But looking at the options, I don't see an option that has millet and legumes without including something incorrect.

Wait, option J is beans, millet, and maize. But maize is wrong, so J is out. Option I is millet, cabbage, and rice. Cabbage is possible but I'm not certain. Rice might not be a primary crop for Yang-shao.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the Majiabang culture (which is more associated with rice) with Yang-shao. Yang-shao was in the north, so maybe they didn't have rice as a main crop. So rice might not be in their list.

So if the options are about Yang-shao, which is millet-based, then the correct choice should include millet and perhaps another crop.

Looking again: Option C includes millet but also barley and maize. Maize is wrong. So C is out.

Option I: millet, cabbage, rice. Millet is correct, but cabbage? I'm not sure if that's accurate. I don't remember specific vegetables they cultivated, but maybe it's plausible.

Wait, another thought: The Yangshao people are known for millet, but I also think they had other crops like wheat. Or was wheat introduced later? Because wheat came to China from Central Asia, perhaps during the Bronze Age.

Wait, the Zhou Dynasty is when Chinese agriculture expanded, but Yang-shao is earlier, around the Neolithic. So maybe they didn't have wheat yet. So perhaps the options that include wheat are not correct.

Looking at the options again:

Option B: soybeans, emmer, rice. Emmer is wheat, so maybe not.

Option D: wheat, rice, peas. If wheat was not present, D is out.

So the only options left with millet are C, I, J, but C and J have maize which is wrong. So only option I is left, which has millet and maybe rice and cabbage.

But I'm not confident about cabbage. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option B, but I thought emmer is from elsewhere.

Wait, maybe I should think about when each crop was domesticated. Millet was definitely in Yang-shao. Rice was domesticated in the south, maybe a bit later. Soybeans were domesticated in China, but perhaps during the Yang-shao period.

Wait, another approach: The Banpo site is a famous Yang-shao site, and I think they found evidence of millet there. So millet is definitely in. What else? I'm trying to remember if they had any legumes.

I think the Yang-shao people also domesticated soybeans and perhaps other legumes. So if an option includes millet and soybeans, that could be it. Looking back, option B includes soybeans, emmer, rice. Emmer is a type of wheat, which I'm not sure about. So maybe option B is incorrect because of emmer.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option E, but no, E has maize.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the option with millet and rice. But I'm not sure if Yang-shao had rice. If rice is more associated with the south, then maybe they didn't have it much.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option D: wheat, rice, and peas. But I thought wheat was not there yet.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of each option:

Option B: soybeans, emmer, rice.

Emmer is Triticum dicoccum, which is an ancient wheat. I don't think it was present in Yang-shao China. So emmer is probably not correct.

Option I: millet, cabbage, rice.

Millet is correct, but cabbage? Not sure. Rice might not be their main crop.

Wait, another point: The Yang-shao culture is known for millet, and maybe they also started with some forms of rice cultivation, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps they had other crops.

Wait, I've just remembered that the Yangshao people are also associated with the domestication of the chicken, and pigs. But that's animals, not crops.

Another thought: The main crops in ancient China were millet in the north and rice in the south. So Yang-shao, being in the north, would have millet as their staple. So any option that includes millet would be a candidate. Let's go back to the options.

Option C: millet, barley, maize. But maize is wrong.

Option I: millet, cabbage, rice. Millet is correct. Cabbage? I don't know, but maybe it's a possible vegetable, but I'm not sure it's the best fit.

Option B: soybeans, emmer, rice. If emmer is wrong, then no.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the time periods. Yang-shao is about 5000-3000 BCE. Maize was domesticated in the Americas around 9,000 years ago, but it didn't reach Asia until much later, like after 2000 BCE. So any option with maize is incorrect.

That leaves options A, B, D, F, G, H, I.

Wait, looking for millet, the correct options are C (maize wrong), I (maybe), and J (maize wrong). So only option I is left.

But I'm not sure about cabbage. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B, but I'm not sure about emmer.

Wait, another approach: What's the usual answer to this question? From what I vaguely recall, Yang-shao is associated with millet and possibly rice. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, I think the correct answer might be option B: soybeans, emmer, rice. Because I remember that soybeans were an important crop in ancient China, and Yang-shao might have started domesticating them. Emmer, though, I'm not so sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option E, but that includes maize which is wrong.

Wait, another thought: The Yangshao culture is part of the broader context where millet was the primary crop. So the correct answer must include millet. Looking again, the only options with millet are C, I, J. But C and J have maize, which is wrong. So only option I remains.

So option I is millet, cabbage, rice. But I'm not sure about cabbage. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but I have to choose from the options.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option B: soybeans, emmer, rice.

Option I: millet, cabbage, rice.

If Yang-shao had millet, then I is better than B because B doesn't have millet. So the correct answer must be I.

But I'm still unsure about cabbage. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, but that doesn't include millet.

Wait, no, the question asks which crops are indicated by the excavation. If millet is a key crop, then the answer must include it. So the only possible option is I.

But I'm not entirely confident about cabbage. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option J, but J has maize which is wrong.

Hmm, this is tricky. I think I should go with the option that includes millet and doesn't have maize. So option I is millet, cabbage, rice. I'll go with that.

The Yang-shao culture, a Neolithic society in northern China, is primarily associated with millet cultivation. Millet was a staple crop in the region, particularly foxtail millet and broomcorn millet. The question requires identifying the domesticated crops indicated by excavations at Yang-shao sites. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Includes barley, lentils, and peas. Barley is more associated with the Fertile Crescent and not commonly linked to Yang-shao.
- **Option B**: Includes soybeans, emmer, and rice. While soybeans are indigenous to China, emmer (a type of wheat) is from the Near East and unlikely to be part of Yang-shao agriculture. Rice was more prominent in southern China.
- **Option C**: Includes millet, barley, and maize. Millet fits, but barley is unlikely, and maize is an American crop introduced to Asia much later.
- **Option D**: Includes wheat, rice, and peas. Wheat was likely introduced to China later, and rice was more prominent in southern regions.
- **Option E**: Includes rice, soybeans, and maize. Maize is incorrect, and rice was not a primary crop in Yang-shao.
- **Option F**: Includes sorghum, emmer, and legumes. Sorghum is more associated with Africa, and emmer is from the Near East.
- **Option G**: Includes maize, cabbage, and peas. Maize is incorrect.
- **Option H**: Includes wheat, barley, and cabbage. Both wheat and barley are unlikely for Yang-shao.
- **Option I**: Includes millet, cabbage, and rice. Millet is correct, but cabbage is uncertain. Rice might not have been a primary crop in Yang-shao.
- **Option J**: Includes beans, millet, and maize. Maize is incorrect.

The only option that includes millet without incorrect crops like maize is **Option I**. While there is some uncertainty about cabbage, millet is a definitive crop of Yang-shao, making this the most plausible choice.
