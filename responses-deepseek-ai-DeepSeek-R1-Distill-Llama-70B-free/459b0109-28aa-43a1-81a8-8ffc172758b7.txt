Question:

After being passed over for a promotion, an aeronautic engineer became a whistleblower. He contacted a government agency to state that the company for which he worked was submitting false safety reports on newly built aircraft. When the company learned that the engineer was leaking this information to the government agency, he was fired from his job. Afterward, the engineer sued the company for wrongful termination of employment. During the discovery stage of litigation, the engineer was deposed by the company's attorney. In his deposition, the engineer stated that the company submitted false safety reports to the government agency to cover up structural defects in its aircraft. A pilot was injured when one of the company'sairplanes he was piloting crashed. The pilot asserteda strict products liability tort against the company. At thal, the pilot seeks to introduce into evidence portions of the engineer's deposition from his wrongful termination lawsuit against the company. Assume that the engineer is unavailable to testify at trial. Upon objection by the company, the trial court judge should rule the engineer's deposition testimony

Options:

A: admissible as former testimony.
B: inadmissible as hearsay within the business records exception.
C: inadmissible due to the engineer's unavailability.
D: admissible as a statement against interest.
E: admissible as a vicarious admission.
F: inadmissible, because the company did not have the opportunity to cross-examine the engineer on the liability issue for which the statement is now being offered.
G: admissible as a dying declaration.
H: inadmissible because the engineer's deposition is biased.
I: inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.
J: admissible as a statement of personal or family history.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this evidence question. Let me read through it carefully.

The situation involves an aeronautic engineer who was passed over for a promotion and then became a whistleblower. He contacted a government agency about his company submitting false safety reports on new aircraft. When the company found out, they fired him, and he sued for wrongful termination. During the discovery phase, he was deposed by the company's attorney. In that deposition, he stated that the company submitted false reports to cover up structural defects. 

Now, a pilot was injured when one of the company's airplanes crashed, and the pilot is suing under strict products liability. The pilot wants to introduce parts of the engineer's deposition from the previous lawsuit. The engineer is unavailable to testify at the trial. The company objects, so the judge has to decide if the deposition can be admitted.

I need to figure out which option is correct from A to J. Let me think about the rules of evidence here.

First, deposition testimony is generally admissible if certain conditions are met. Since the engineer is unavailable, the key issue is whether the deposition falls under a hearsay exception.

Depositions can be used as prior testimony under FRE 804(b)(1) if the witness is unavailable. But for that, the opposing party must have had the opportunity to cross-examine the witness during the deposition. Here, the company's attorney did depose him, so they had the chance to cross-examine him in that proceeding.

Wait, but the issue is whether the deposition was taken in a different case (the wrongful termination lawsuit) and now being used in this products liability case. The problem is that the deposition was taken in a different litigation. So, the admissibility would depend on whether the prior testimony was given in a proceeding where the same parties had a chance to cross-examine.

Wait, but in this case, the company is the same as in the prior case. So in the wrongful termination case, the company was the defendant, and they took the engineer's deposition. Now, in the pilot's case against the company, the company is again the defendant. So the same party had the chance to cross-examine the engineer in the prior proceeding.

So under FRE 804(b)(1), former testimony is admissible if the witness is unavailable, and the testimony was given in a prior proceeding where the opposing party had the opportunity to cross-examine. So that could make it admissible as former testimony, which is option A.

But wait, another thought: the deposition was not from a trial but from a deposition. So former testimony can include depositions under FRE 804(b)(1) if the other conditions are met. So since the company had the chance to cross-examine in the deposition, it should be admissible.

Alternatively, maybe it's an admission. Because the engineer was an employee, his statements could be admissions by a party opponent under FRE 801(d)(2). But wait, the engineer was fired, so at the time of the deposition, he was no longer an employee. So his statements might not be considered admissions by the company. Because admissions are statements by party opponents while they were employed, etc.

Alternatively, maybe it's a statement against interest under FRE 804(b)(3). For that, the statement must be against the engineer's interest at the time it was made. But in the deposition, he was suing the company for wrongful termination. His statement that the company submitted false reports would be against the company's interest, but not necessarily against his own. Unless he was admitting some wrongdoing that could expose him to liability. Hmm, maybe that's a stretch.

Wait, the engineer is the plaintiff in his own lawsuit, so his statements in the deposition would be in his own case. So if he was testifying against the company, perhaps his statements were self-serving, not against interest. So maybe the statement against interest exception doesn't apply here.

Another angle: whether the deposition can be used as a business record. But the business records exception (FRE 803(6)) applies to records made at the time of the event, in the regular course of business. A deposition is a legal document, not a regular business record, so that exception might not apply. So option B says inadmissible as hearsay within the business records exception. That would be incorrect if it's admissible under another exception.

Option E is about vicarious admissions. That would require that the statement was made by someone authorized to make it. But again, since the engineer was fired, maybe he wasn't authorized anymore. So that might not apply.

Option F says inadmissible because the company didn't have the opportunity to cross on the liability issue now. But wait, in the prior deposition, the company's attorney did cross-examine him about the false reports and structural defects, right? Because those issues were relevant to his wrongful termination case. So the company had the chance to cross-examine on the same issues. So F might not be a valid objection.

Wait, but in the current case, the issue is strict products liability, which might have different elements than the wrongful termination. But during the deposition, the engineer's statements about false safety reports and structural defects would have been relevant to both cases. So the company would have had the opportunity to cross-examine on those points. So F shouldn't be a problem.

So going back, option A is admissible as former testimony. Since the engineer is unavailable, and the company had the chance to cross-examine in the prior deposition, it should be admissible under 804(b)(1).

Alternatively, if the court doesn't consider the prior deposition as former testimony because it's from a different case, maybe another exception applies. But I think the key is that in the prior proceeding, the same party (the company) had the chance to cross-examine, making it admissible as former testimony.

So the correct answer should be A: admissible as former testimony.

Wait, but another possibility: depositions are generally admissible under FRE 804(b)(1) if the witness is unavailable, and the party against whom it's offered had an opportunity to cross-examine. Here, the company did cross-examine, so yes.

I think that's right. So the judge should rule it admissible as former testimony, making option A correct.

The question revolves around the admissibility of an engineer's deposition testimony in a strict products liability case, where the engineer is unavailable to testify. The engineer, a former employee, was deposed in a prior wrongful termination lawsuit against the company, during which he stated that the company submitted false safety reports to cover up structural defects. The pilot now seeks to admit portions of this deposition into evidence, and the company objects.

To determine admissibility, the analysis focuses on whether the deposition testimony qualifies under a hearsay exception. Specifically, the deposition could be admissible as "former testimony" under Federal Rule of Evidence (FRE) 804(b)(1). This rule allows prior testimony to be admitted if the witness is unavailable and the opposing party had the opportunity to cross-examine the witness in the prior proceeding. Here, the company, as the same party in both cases, had the chance to cross-examine the engineer during the deposition in the wrongful termination lawsuit. Since the engineer's statements about false safety reports and structural defects are relevant to both cases, the company had the opportunity to address these issues during the prior deposition.

Other options, such as the statement against interest exception (FRE 804(b)(3)) or business records exception (FRE 803(6)), do not apply because the engineer's statements were not against his own interest at the time, and depositions are not considered business records. Additionally, the argument that the company lacked the opportunity to cross-examine on the specific liability issue is invalid, as the company had already addressed these issues during the prior deposition.

Thus, the deposition testimony is admissible as former testimony under FRE 804(b)(1).
