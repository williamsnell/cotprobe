Okay, so I'm trying to solve this unemployment insurance tax problem. Let me see what the question is asking.

The question says that an employer has a total taxable payroll of $100,000. They need to pay both federal and state unemployment insurance taxes. The federal rate is 0.4%, and the state rate is 2.7%. I need to calculate how much the employer pays to each and choose the correct option from A to J.

Alright, first step is to understand what these percentages mean. I think these are the tax rates applied to the payroll. So, for each part, I'll calculate the tax by multiplying the payroll by the respective rate.

Starting with the federal part. The rate is 0.4%, so I convert that to a decimal. 0.4% is 0.004 in decimal. Multiply that by $100,000.

Let me do the math: 100,000 * 0.004. Hmm, 100,000 times 0.004. Well, 100,000 times 0.001 is 100, so 0.004 is four times that. So 4 * 100 is 400. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 0.4% is 0.004, right? So 100,000 * 0.004 is 400. So the federal tax is $400.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see $400 as the first number in all options. Let's check the options again.

Wait, option C is $400 and $2,700. Option J is $400 and $2,600. Option B is 300 and 2700, that's lower than 400, so probably wrong.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate. 0.4% of 100,000. 0.4% is like 0.4 per 100. So 100,000 is 1000 times 100. So 0.4 * 1000 is 400. Yeah, that's correct.

Now the state part. The rate is 2.7%, so that's 0.027 as a decimal. Multiply by 100,000.

100,000 * 0.027. Let me calculate that. 100,000 times 0.02 is 2,000. 100,000 times 0.007 is 700. So 2,000 + 700 is 2,700. So the state tax is $2,700.

So putting it together, the federal is $400 and the state is $2,700. Looking at the options:

Option C is $400 and $2,700. Option J is $400 and $2,600. So the correct one should have 400 and 2700, which is option C.

Wait, but I should double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Federal: 0.4% of 100,000 is 400. State: 2.7% of 100k is 2700. So yes, option C is correct.

The employer's federal unemployment tax is calculated as 0.4% of $100,000, which equals $400. The state unemployment tax is 2.7% of $100,000, totaling $2,700. Among the options, only option C matches these amounts.
