Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that one mole of Argon gas undergoes an adiabatic expansion. It starts at 310 K, and it expands against a pressure of zero. The initial volume is 8.5 liters, and it expands to 82.0 liters. I need to find the final temperature using the ideal gas law.

Wait, right, adiabatic processes are where there's no heat exchange with the surroundings, so Q=0. But wait, in this case, the expansion is against a pressure of zero. Oh, right, when the external pressure is zero, that's a free expansion. Hmm, but wait, free expansion is also adiabatic because no work is done. Or is it?

Wait, no. Wait, in a free expansion, the system expands against a vacuum, so the external pressure is zero. In that case, no work is done (since W = P_ext * ΔV, and P_ext is zero, so W=0). And since the process is adiabatic (Q=0), the first law of thermodynamics says ΔU = Q + W = 0. So the internal energy change is zero. For an ideal gas, the internal energy depends only on temperature. So if ΔU is zero, the temperature doesn't change. So the final temperature should be the same as the initial temperature, which is 310 K.

Wait, but wait a second. I thought that in an adiabatic expansion, the temperature usually changes because the system does work on the surroundings, which would lower the internal energy and thus the temperature. But that's when the system is expanding against a non-zero external pressure.

In this case, since P_ext is zero, the expansion is free. So no work is done because W = P_ext * (V_final - V_initial). So W = 0. And since it's adiabatic, Q=0, so ΔU = 0. Therefore, the temperature remains the same.

So looking at the options, option F is 310 K, which is the initial temperature. So that should be the correct answer.

But wait, maybe I should think about the process more carefully. Let me recall the adiabatic condition. The formula for an adiabatic process (where Q=0) for an ideal gas is TV^(γ-1) = constant, or alternatively, T1 * V1^(γ-1) = T2 * V2^(γ-1).

Wait, but that formula applies when the process is reversible and adiabatic. In a free expansion, the process is irreversible because it's against zero pressure, so maybe that formula doesn't apply here.

Right, because the formula TV^(γ-1) = constant holds for reversible adiabatic processes. If the process is irreversible, like a free expansion, then that relation might not hold.

In a free expansion, as I thought earlier, no work is done, so the internal energy doesn't change, so the temperature remains the same. So for an ideal gas, which only depends on temperature for internal energy, the temperature doesn't change.

So in this problem, since the expansion is against zero pressure, it's a free expansion, and the temperature remains the same. So the answer should be 310 K, which is option F.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me think of the first law again. ΔU = Q + W. Q=0 (adiabatic), W=0 (since P_ext is zero), so ΔU=0. Since U is a function of temperature only for ideal gases, T_final = T_initial.

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer is F.

In this problem, one mole of Argon gas undergoes an adiabatic expansion against an external pressure of $P_{\text{external}} = 0$, expanding from an initial volume of $8.5 \, \mathrm{L}$ to a final volume of $82.0 \, \mathrm{L}$. The goal is to determine the final temperature of the gas using the ideal gas law.

An adiabatic process is defined as one where there is no heat exchange with the surroundings ($Q = 0$). However, in this case, the expansion occurs against a pressure of zero, which means it is a free expansion. In a free expansion, no work is done ($W = P_{\text{external}} \cdot \Delta V = 0$) because the external pressure is zero. According to the first law of thermodynamics, $\Delta U = Q + W$. Since both $Q = 0$ and $W = 0$, the internal energy change is $\Delta U = 0$. For an ideal gas, the internal energy depends only on temperature, so if $\Delta U = 0$, the temperature remains constant.

The formula $T V^{\gamma - 1} = \text{constant}$, which applies to reversible adiabatic processes, does not apply here because the process is irreversible (as it is a free expansion). Instead, the temperature remains unchanged because the internal energy does not change.

Thus, the final temperature of the gas is the same as its initial temperature, which is $310 \, \mathrm{K}$. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**F: 310 K**

Answer: F
