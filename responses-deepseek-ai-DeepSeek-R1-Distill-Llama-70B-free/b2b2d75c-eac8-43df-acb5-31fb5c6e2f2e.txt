Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about linguistics terms. The question is asking about the rules that govern the placement of words and phrases in a sentence. Hmm, I need to figure out which term corresponds to that definition.

Let me think about what each option means. I remember that linguistics has several branches, each dealing with different aspects of language. 

Option A is Semiotics. I think that's more about signs and symbols in general, not specifically about sentence structure. So probably not A.

Option B is Phonology. Phonology deals with the sounds of language, right? Like how sounds are organized and used. So that's about pronunciation, not word placement. So B is out.

Option C is Lexicology. That's the study of words and their meanings, including their origins. But the question is about the arrangement of words, not the words themselves. So C doesn't fit.

Option D is Pragmatics. Pragmatics is about how context affects meaning. Like, how the situation or speaker's intention influences what is communicated. Not about the order of words, so D isn't the answer.

Option E is Grammar. Grammar does involve the rules of language, including syntax and morphology. But wait, the question is specifically about placement of words and phrases. I think syntax is a part of grammar, but maybe the question is looking for the more specific term.

Option F is Orthography. That's about spelling and how words are written. So F isn't relevant here.

Option G is Phonemes. Phonemes are the smallest units of sound in a language. Again, related to sound, not structure.

Option H is Syntax. Yes, I remember that syntax is the study of how words and phrases are arranged to form sentences. That sounds exactly like what the question is describing.

Option I is Morphology. Morphology looks at the structure of words, like how morphemes (smallest units of meaning) combine. So it's about word structure, not sentence structure.

Option J is Semantics. Semantics is about meaning, both word meaning and sentence meaning. But again, not about the arrangement of words.

So the correct answer should be H: Syntax. Because syntax deals with the rules governing the placement of words and phrases in a sentence.

The rules governing the placement of words and phrases in a sentence are referred to as syntax. This branch of linguistics specifically examines how words and phrases are arranged to form sentences. 

Answer: H
