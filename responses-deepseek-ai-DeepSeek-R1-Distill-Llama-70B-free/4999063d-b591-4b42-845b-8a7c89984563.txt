Question:

Describe the evolution of the reptilian excretory system to account for the transition from an aquatic to a terrestrial habitat.

Options:

A: The excretory system includes a secondary bladder for water storage.
B: The reptilian excretory system has evolved to excrete more water
C: Reptiles have evolved to have a smooth, wet skin
D: Reptiles have evolved to excrete nitrogenous wastes primarily as ammonia to conserve water.
E: Reptiles have developed larger glomeruli to increase water retention.
F: The excretory system has adapted to increase salt excretion to facilitate life in marine environments.
G: Reptilian kidneys have evolved to produce ammonia directly for more efficient water use.
H: Reptiles excrete nitrogenous wastes as urea
I: The excretory system has evolved a complex series of ducts to recycle water back into the body.
J: The reptilian excretory system has evolved to conserve most of its water with modifications like a coarse, dry, horny skin, decreased size of glomeruli, greater reabsorption of water from glomerular filtrate, and excretion of nitrogenous wastes as uric acid.

Okay, so I have this question about the evolution of the reptilian excretory system when moving from water to land. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think. 

So, when animals move from aquatic to terrestrial environments, one of the big challenges is water conservation. In water, animals can just excrete ammonia because it's soluble, but on land, they need to conserve water. 

I remember that mammals and birds excrete urea, which is less toxic and can be concentrated, saving water. But what about reptiles? Oh wait, I think reptiles might excrete uric acid. Uric acid is even more concentrated, so it uses less water. 

Looking at the options, J says they excrete nitrogenous waste as uric acid. Also, the other modifications like coarse, dry skin help reduce water loss. Decreased glomeruli size would mean less filtration, which saves water. And more reabsorption of water from the filtrate definitely helps retain water. 

So, putting it together, the excretory system evolved to conserve water by making the skin less permeable, adjusting kidney function to retain more water, and switching to uric acid for waste. That makes J the correct answer.

The transition from an aquatic to a terrestrial habitat required significant adaptations in the reptilian excretory system to conserve water. Key modifications include the development of coarse, dry, horny skin to reduce water loss, smaller glomeruli to decrease filtration rate, increased reabsorption of water from the glomerular filtrate, and the excretion of nitrogenous wastes as uric acid, which is more water-efficient than ammonia. These changes enabled reptiles to thrive in dry environments.

J: The reptilian excretory system has evolved to conserve most of its water with modifications like a coarse, dry, horny skin, decreased size of glomeruli, greater reabsorption of water from glomerular filtrate, and excretion of nitrogenous wastes as uric acid.

Answer: J
