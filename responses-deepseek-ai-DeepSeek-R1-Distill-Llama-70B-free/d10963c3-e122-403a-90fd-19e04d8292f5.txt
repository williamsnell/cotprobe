Question:

Which of the following statements is not applicable to the Securitization process?

Options:

A: Where the securitizing actor is a democratic state, the relevant audience is usually the wider population who have the right to reject the speech act.
B: Securitization reveals the power of the securitizing actor.
C: The adoption of extraordinary measures can retrospectively convince an audience of the existential threat.
D: The process of securitization is always reversible.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about securitization, and I need to figure out which statement isn't applicable. I remember that securitization is a concept from security studies, particularly from the Copenhagen School. Let me try to break it down.

The question asks which of the options is not applicable to the securitization process. The options are A through E.

First, I'll recall what securitization entails. Securitization is the process where an issue is framed as an existential threat to a referent object (like national security), which then enables the securitizing actor (like a government) to take extraordinary measures beyond normal political procedures. This is often done through speech acts.

Looking at each option:

Option A: Where the securitizing actor is a democratic state, the relevant audience is usually the wider population who have the right to reject the speech act. That makes sense because in democracies, public opinion and legislative approval matter more. The audience includes the general public, media, etc., who can accept or reject the securitization move.

Option B: Securitization reveals the power of the securitizing actor. Yes, because only certain actors have the authority to successfully securitize an issue. For example, government officials or international organizations. So this shows their power.

Option C: The adoption of extraordinary measures can retrospectively convince an audience of the existential threat. I think this is about how once measures are taken, it might make the threat seem more real. Like, if a government starts taking drastic actions, people might later think, "Oh, it must have been serious." So that fits.

Option D: The process of securitization is always reversible. Hmm. I'm not sure about this. I remember that securitization is often a contingency, not necessarily always successful. Once something is securitized, it might be hard to reverse because it's framed as an existential threat. Also, desecuritization is possible, but it's not guaranteed. So maybe this statement isn't correct. It's not always reversible, right?

Option E: Within authoritarian regimes, decision-making is dominated by military and political elites. That makes sense because in such regimes, the elite have more control, so the audience is more limited. The speech act might be more about convincing other elites rather than the general public.

So, the question is which one is NOT applicable. If D says securitization is always reversible, that's probably incorrect. Because sometimes securitization becomes entrenched, and reversing it would be difficult or might not happen. So D is the statement that's not applicable.

Wait, but let me think again. The Copenhagen School, particularly Buzan and Waever, talked about securitization as a process that can be successful or not. If it's successful, then the issue is moved out of normal politics. But can it be reversed? Desecuritization is possible, but is it always possible? I think it's not always reversible. So D's statement is incorrect because it's not always reversible.

The correct answer is D: The process of securitization is always reversible.

Step-by-step explanation:

- **Option A** is applicable because in democratic states, the audience includes the wider population who can accept or reject the securitization speech act.
- **Option B** is applicable as securitization reflects the power of the actor to frame an issue as an existential threat.
- **Option C** is applicable because extraordinary measures can retrospectively validate the perceived threat.
- **Option D** is not applicable because securitization is not always reversible; desecuritization is possible but not guaranteed.
- **Option E** is applicable in authoritarian regimes where decision-making is controlled by elites.

Thus, the statement that is not applicable is **D**.

Answer: D
