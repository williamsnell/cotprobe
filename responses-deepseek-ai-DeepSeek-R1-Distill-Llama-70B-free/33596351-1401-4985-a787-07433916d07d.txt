Okay, so I've got this question about cointegration, and I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question says.

The question states that two variables, x_t and y_t, are cointegrated, and asks which of the statements (i) through (iv) are true. The options are combinations of these statements.

First, I remember that cointegration is a concept in time series analysis. It's about the long-term relationship between non-stationary time series variables. I think cointegrated variables don't have to be stationary themselves, but their linear combination is stationary.

Looking at statement (i): "x_t and y_t must both be stationary." Wait, if they are cointegrated, they don't have to be stationary. In fact, cointegration typically applies to non-stationary variables, like those that are integrated of order 1 (I(1)). So if x_t and y_t are cointegrated, they could both be non-stationary. So statement (i) is false. That eliminates any options that include (i) as correct. But wait, let me check the others because I might be misremembering.

Statement (ii): "Only one linear combination of x_t and y_t will be stationary." I think cointegration implies that there exists at least one such combination that's stationary. But can there be more than one? Hmm, I'm a bit hazy here. Wait, in a bivariate system, cointegration implies that there's a single cointegrating vector. So only one unique (up to scalar multiples) combination exists that's stationary. So statement (ii) is true.

Moving on to statement (iii): "The cointegrating equation for x_t and y_t describes the short-run relationship between the two series." Wait, no, I think the cointegrating equation represents the long-run equilibrium relationship. The short-run dynamics are usually captured by the error correction model, like in a VAR with an error correction term. So statement (iii) is false.

Statement (iv): "The residuals of a regression of y_t on x_t must be stationary." If x and y are cointegrated, then their linear combination (like y - Î²x) is stationary. So if I run a regression of y on x, the residuals (which would be the error term from that regression) should be stationary, right? Because the residuals represent the stationary combination. So (iv) is true.

Wait, but I thought that in cointegration, the residuals from the regression are used in the Engle-Granger two-step method. They check if the residuals are stationary. So yes, if they are cointegrated, the residuals are stationary. So (iv) is correct.

So let me recap:

i) False
ii) True
iii) False
iv) True

So which statements are correct? (ii) and (iv) are correct. So looking at the options, option D is (ii) and (iv) only. So the correct answer should be D.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's go through each point again.

i) x_t and y_t must be stationary? No, they can be non-stationary but integrated. So (i) is wrong.

ii) Only one linear combination is stationary. Since they are cointegrated, there's exactly one (assuming bivariate case), so (ii) is correct.

iii) Cointegrating equation is short-run? No, it's long-run. So (iii) is wrong.

iv) Residuals from regression must be stationary. Yes, because cointegration requires that. So (iv) is correct.

So the correct statements are (ii) and (iv), which is option D.

If two variables, \( x_t \) and \( y_t \), are cointegrated, the following analysis applies to the given statements:

1. **Statement (i):** " \( x_t \) and \( y_t \) must both be stationary"  
   This is incorrect. Cointegration typically applies to non-stationary variables, such as those integrated of order 1 (I(1)). Cointegrated variables do not need to be stationary themselves, but their linear combination is stationary.

2. **Statement (ii):** "Only one linear combination of \( x_t \) and \( y_t \) will be stationary"  
   This is correct. In a bivariate system, cointegration implies that there exists exactly one unique (up to scalar multiples) linear combination of \( x_t \) and \( y_t \) that is stationary.

3. **Statement (iii):** "The cointegrating equation for \( x_t \) and \( y_t \) describes the short-run relationship between the two series"  
   This is incorrect. The cointegrating equation represents the long-run equilibrium relationship, not the short-run dynamics. The short-run relationship is typically captured by an error correction model.

4. **Statement (iv):** "The residuals of a regression of \( y_t \) on \( x_t \) must be stationary"  
   This is correct. If \( x_t \) and \( y_t \) are cointegrated, the residuals from a regression of \( y_t \) on \( x_t \) (which represent the stationary linear combination) must be stationary. This is a key property used in the Engle-Granger two-step method for testing cointegration.

Based on this analysis, the correct statements are (ii) and (iv). Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D: (ii) and (iv) only**
