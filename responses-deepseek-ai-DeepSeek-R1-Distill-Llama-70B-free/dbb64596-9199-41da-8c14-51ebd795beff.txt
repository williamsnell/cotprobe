Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because stoichiometry isn't my strongest suit, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that solder, which is a lead-tin alloy, is treated with warm 30% HNO3. From this reaction, they get a lead nitrate solution and some insoluble white residue. After drying, the white residue weighs 0.600 grams and is identified as SnO2. The question is asking for the percentage of tin in the original sample.

Hmm. So the reaction given is: Sn + 4HNO3 → SnO2 + 4NO2 + 2H2O. Wait, no, the equation in the problem is written as Sn + 4HNO3 → SnO2 + 4N2 + 2H2O. Oh, wait, that can't be right because nitric acid usually produces NO3^- in solution. Oh wait, perhaps I should double-check the reaction. Oh wait, the problem says the reaction produces lead nitrate solution and SnO2, so lead is reacting with nitric acid to form lead nitrate, and tin is forming SnO2, which is insoluble.

Wait, so the solder is an alloy of lead and tin. When treated with HNO3, lead reacts to form lead nitrate, which is soluble, and tin reacts to form SnO2, which is the white residue. So the lead goes into solution, and the tin forms a precipitate.

So the initial sample was 1.00 gram of the alloy. After reaction, we have 0.600 grams of SnO2. So the mass of tin in the alloy is the mass that went into forming SnO2.

But wait, the sample is 1.00 grams total, so the rest is lead. So first, I need to find the mass of tin in the alloy. Because the SnO2 comes from the tin in the alloy.

So let's break it down:

1. Find moles of SnO2. The molar mass of SnO2 is Sn (118.71 g/mol) + 2*O (16.00 each) = 118.71 + 32 = 150.71 g/mol. So moles of SnO2 is 0.600 g / 150.71 g/mol. Let me calculate that: 0.6 / 150.71 ≈ 0.003984 moles.

Each mole of SnO2 corresponds to one mole of Sn, because the reaction is Sn → SnO2. So moles of Sn in the alloy is 0.003984 moles.

Mass of Sn is moles * molar mass. So 0.003984 * 118.71 ≈ let's see, 0.004 * 120 is 0.48, but a bit less. 0.003984 * 118.71 ≈ 0.472 grams. Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

118.71 * 0.003984 = let's calculate:

118.71 * 0.004 = 0.47484, but since it's 0.003984, which is 0.000016 less than 0.004, so 0.47484 - (118.71 * 0.000016). 118.71 * 0.000016 is approx 0.001899. So 0.47484 - 0.001899 = 0.47294 grams. So about 0.4729 grams of Sn.

So the mass of tin in the alloy is approximately 0.4729 grams. The total mass of the alloy was 1.00 gram, so the percentage of tin is (0.4729 / 1.00) * 100% ≈ 47.29%.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me recompute the moles of SnO2.

SnO2 molar mass: Sn is 118.71, O is 16.00 each, so 118.71 + 2*16 = 118.71 +32=150.71 g/mol.

Moles = 0.600 g / 150.71 = 0.600 / 150.71 ≈ 0.003984 moles.

Molar mass of Sn is 118.71, so mass of Sn is 0.003984 * 118.71.

Let me calculate this precisely:

0.003984 * 100 = 0.3984
0.003984 * 18.71 = ?

Wait, 0.003984 * 18.71:

18 * 0.003984 = 0.071712
0.71 * 0.003984 ≈ 0.00282944
Total: 0.071712 + 0.00282944 = 0.07454144

So 0.3984 + 0.07454144 = 0.47294144 grams, so approximately 0.4729 grams.

So the percentage is (0.4729 g / 1.00 g) * 100% = 47.29%. Now, looking at the options, option F is 47.2%, which is very close. So the answer should be F.

Wait, but wait a second—could there be another approach? Let me check. Another way is to consider that the mass of SnO2 is 0.6 grams, which came from the Sn in the alloy. So the moles of Sn are same as moles of SnO2, which is 0.6 / 150.71 ≈ 0.003984, and then mass of Sn is 0.003984 * 118.71 = ~0.4729 grams, which is 47.29%, so 47.3%, which would correspond to option F (47.2%) as the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the reaction equation. Let me check the reaction again. The problem says the reaction is Sn + 4HNO3 → SnO2 + 4N2 + 2H2O. Wait, but that's not balanced. Let me balance it.

Sn on the reactant side: 1. On product side: 1 in SnO2.

Nitrogen: 4 HNO3 → 4 N2. So each HNO3 has one N, so 4 on reactant side. On product, 4 N2 is 8 N atoms. So that's not balanced. Hmm. So perhaps the reaction is incorrect, but I think the problem is correct in that the residue is SnO2, and the lead is in solution as Pb(NO3)2. But since the question is about the tin, maybe the reaction equation for tin is correct as written.

Wait, perhaps the reaction is actually:

Sn + 4HNO3 → SnO2 + 4NO2↑ + 2H2O.

Because I'm more familiar with nitric acid reactions producing NO3^- and NO2 as a gas, but in this case, the problem says the reaction produces N2. Wait, that's unusual. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is a typo, but for the purpose of solving the problem, maybe I should proceed as the problem states.

Wait, but the problem gives the reaction as Sn + 4HNO3 → SnO2 + 4N2 + 2H2O. So that's the equation we have to use. But from a stoichiometric standpoint, let's check if it's balanced.

Looking at Sn: left side 1, right side 1 in SnO2. Good.

Nitrogen: left side 4 (from 4 HNO3). Right side: 4 N2 is 8 N atoms. So 4 on left, 8 on right. Not balanced. So perhaps the reaction is incorrect, but I think the problem states that, so perhaps I should proceed, assuming that the reaction is correctly given, even if it's not balanced, but maybe it's a typo and the product is NO2 instead of N2. Because I've never heard of tin reacting with nitric acid to produce N2, but maybe it's a specific condition.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction is correct as written, but it's just a given, so for the stoichiometry, I can proceed as moles of Sn in SnO2 equals moles of Sn in the alloy.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the correct balanced equation, but the way it's written is correct. Let me try to balance the equation as given.

The reaction as written is: Sn + 4HNO3 → SnO2 + 4N2 + 2H2O.

Let me count each element:

Sn: 1 on each side. Good.

H: 4 on left (from HNO3) and 2*2=4 on right (from 2H2O). Good.

N: 4 on left (4 HNO3), 4*2=8 on right (4 N2). So not balanced.

O: 4*3=12 on left (from 4 HNO3) and 2 (from SnO2) + 2*O from H2O: (SnO2 has 2 O) + (2 H2O has 2*(1 O) each = 2 O). So total O on right: 2 + 2*(1) = 4? Wait no: SnO2 has 2 O, 2 H2O has 2*(1 O) each, so 2 + 2 = 4 O on the right. On the left, 4 HNO3 has 4*(3 O) = 12 O. So O is 12 on left, 4 on right. Not balanced.

So this suggests that the reaction equation provided isn't balanced. But perhaps that doesn't matter for solving the problem because we're only concerned with the tin part. So the moles of Sn in the alloy equal the moles of SnO2 produced, which is 0.600 grams.

So, I think my initial approach is correct. So the percentage of tin is approximately 47.29%, which is closest to option F, 47.2%.

To determine the percentage of tin in the solder alloy, we start by analyzing the reaction and the data provided. The solder is a lead-tin alloy, and when treated with nitric acid, tin reacts to form SnO₂, which is the insoluble white residue. The mass of this residue is given as 0.600 g. 

### Step 1: Calculate the molar mass of SnO₂
The molar mass of SnO₂ is calculated as:
\[
\text{Molar mass of SnO}_2 = \text{Molar mass of Sn} + 2 \times \text{Molar mass of O} = 118.71 + 2(16.00) = 150.71 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]

### Step 2: Determine the moles of SnO₂
The number of moles of SnO₂ is given by:
\[
\text{Moles of SnO}_2 = \frac{\text{Mass of SnO}_2}{\text{Molar mass of SnO}_2} = \frac{0.600}{150.71} \approx 0.003984 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 3: Relate moles of SnO₂ to moles of Sn
From the reaction, each mole of SnO₂ corresponds to one mole of Sn, as Sn is the only source of tin in the alloy. Therefore:
\[
\text{Moles of Sn} = \text{Moles of SnO}_2 = 0.003984 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the mass of Sn
The mass of Sn is calculated using its molar mass:
\[
\text{Mass of Sn} = \text{Moles of Sn} \times \text{Molar mass of Sn} = 0.003984 \times 118.71 \approx 0.4729 \, \text{g}.
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the percentage of Sn in the alloy
The total mass of the alloy is 1.00 g. The percentage of tin in the alloy is:
\[
\text{Percentage of Sn} = \left( \frac{\text{Mass of Sn}}{\text{Total mass of alloy}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{0.4729}{1.00} \right) \times 100 \approx 47.29\%.
\]

### Step 6: Match the closest option
The closest option to 47.29% is **47.2%**, which corresponds to **option F**.

**Answer: F**
