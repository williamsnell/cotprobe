Okay, so I've got this economics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is asking why economists use per capita figures so often when discussing growth. Hmm, I remember that per capita means per person, right? So it's like dividing some total by the population.

Let me think about what I know. When economists talk about growth, they often look at things like GDP, which is the total economic output of a country. But just looking at GDP might not tell the whole story because if a country's population is growing, the GDP per person could be different. For example, if Country A has a GDP of $100 million and a population of 1 million, the per capita GDP is $100. If next year the GDP stays the same but population increases to 2 million, the per capita would drop to $50, even though total GDP didn't change.

So using per capita figures probably helps normalize the data, making it easier to compare across different countries or time periods. It's about showing how much each individual gets on average. That makes sense because when we talk about economic growth, we're often interested in whether people's lives are improving, which ties into their individual welfare.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Tracking businesses. I don't think per capita is used for that. It's more about economic outputs or income per person.

Option B: Total wealth of the government. That doesn't seem right. Per capita would relate to distribution, not the total.

Option C: Measures growth more accurately and shows individual welfare changes. This aligns with what I was thinking. Per capita adjusts for population, showing individual impact.

Option D: Distribution of natural resources. Not sure, but per capita is more about economic metrics, not natural resources.

Option E: Richest individuals. No, per capita is an average, not about the top earners.

Option F: Simplify calculations. Maybe, but the main reason is more about accurate comparison rather than simplicity.

Option G: Population growth. While per capita relates to population, it's used in the context of economic indicators, not just population trends.

Option H: Predicting future trends. That's one use, but not the main reason why they're used so often in discussing growth.

Option I: Easier for public to understand. Maybe, but I think it's more about the accuracy of the data rather than public understanding.

Option J: Total output. No, that's what GDP is, not per capita.

So the best option seems to be C. It's about measuring growth accurately by considering per person, which reflects changes in individual welfare better than total figures alone.

Economists use per capita figures to normalize data, allowing for accurate comparisons across different populations and time periods. This adjustment helps in understanding individual welfare by showing how economic growth impacts people on an average basis. 

Answer: C
