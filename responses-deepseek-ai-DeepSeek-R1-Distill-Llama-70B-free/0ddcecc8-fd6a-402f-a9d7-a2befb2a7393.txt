Okay, so I've got this biology question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says: "Two related species evolve in a way that makes them less similar." And then there are ten options from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that when species evolve and become more different, it's called divergence. Wait, but wait. So I should think about the terms.

I think divergent evolution is when two species from a common ancestor become more different over time. Like, maybe if they live in different environments, natural selection pushes them in different directions. So their traits become less similar.

Alternatively, convergent evolution is when unrelated species become more similar because they're adapting to similar environments. Like how dolphins and sharks have similar fins even though they're not closely related.

So the question is about two related species becoming less similar. That fits with divergent evolution. So the answer would be D: Divergent evolution.

Wait, but what about speciation? Speciation is when new species form, which could involve divergence. But speciation itself refers more to the process of forming new species, not necessarily the aspect of becoming less similar after that.

So yeah, the answer should be D.

The question asks about two related species evolving to become less similar. This process is known as divergent evolution, where species from a common ancestor develop different traits over time, often due to different environmental pressures. 

Divergent evolution specifically refers to the increase in differences between species, making them less similar. Other options like speciation involve the formation of new species but don't directly describe the process of becoming less similar. Convergent evolution, in contrast, involves unrelated species becoming more similar.

Thus, the correct answer is D: Divergent evolution.

Answer: D
