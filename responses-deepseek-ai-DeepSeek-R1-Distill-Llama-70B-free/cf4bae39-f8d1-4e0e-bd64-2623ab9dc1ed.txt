Okay, so I've got this history question about the Aztecs, specifically regarding the commoners in the rural villages of Capilco and Cuexcomate. I'm a bit rusty on my Aztec history, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking about their living conditions. The options are from A to J, each describing different scenarios. Let me recall what I know about Aztec society.

From what I remember, the Aztecs had a pretty structured society with different classes. The commoners, or the peasants, were called macehualli. They were the backbone of the empire, working as farmers, artisans, etc. They had certain obligations to the state, like paying taxes in the form of goods and labor. But I'm not entirely sure about the specifics.

Option A says they had to pay a high tax in goods and labor to the local governor. I think this might be plausible because the Aztecs had a system where commoners paid tribute, including both goods and labor. This could include things like food, cloth, and work on public projects.

Option B suggests they lived under the threat of being sold into slavery. I'm not too sure about this. Slavery did exist in Aztec society, but I think it was more for those who couldn't pay their debts or were captured in wars. Commoners might not have been under constant threat unless they failed in their obligations.

Option C says they were mostly left alone and did fairly well. That doesn't sound right. The Aztecs were known for their strong central government, so I doubt the commoners were left alone. They probably had significant obligations to the state.

Option D mentions being under the high priest's control with regular sacrifices. While religion was a big part of Aztec life, I don't think the high priest directly controlled the commoners. The priests had influence, but the political structure was more about the rulers and governors.

Option E talks about being policed by the king's guards. Maybe, but I'm not certain how heavy the policing was in rural areas. The Aztecs did have a system of local governance, so perhaps local leaders rather than the king's direct forces were in charge.

Option F says they were ruled by an iron fist with armies stationed there. That seems a bit extreme. While the Aztecs had a strong military, I don't think every village had armies stationed. It was more about control through tribute and local leaders.

Option G: Forced to send half their maize as tribute and live in poverty. I'm not sure about the exact amount, but tribute was a big part. However, whether it led to absolute poverty is questionable. Maybe they managed but had a hard time, but I'm not certain.

Option H: All children educated in the city. That doesn't sound right. Education was more for the elite and the priests. Commoners probably didn't have that opportunity, especially in rural areas.

Option I: No protection from invading city-states. I think the Aztecs had a system where they protected their tributaries, so this might not be accurate.

Option J: Forced to work on large irrigation projects. That seems plausible because the Aztecs were known for their engineering projects, and commoners would have been required to contribute labor as part of their tribute.

So, narrowing it down. The question is about their general condition. A talks about high taxes to the local governor. J is about forced labor on projects. Both seem possible.

Wait, I recall that the Aztecs had a system where commoners paid tribute in goods (like maize, beans, etc.) and also provided labor for public works, like roads, temples, and irrigation. So both A and J could be correct. But the question is about their living conditions, so which option best describes that.

Looking back, the options are about what the commoners experienced. So option A is about paying high taxes in goods and labor, which aligns with what I remember about the tribute system. Option J is specifically about irrigation projects, which is a type of labor they might have done, but perhaps the broader answer is A.

Wait, but the question is about the villages of Capilco and Cuexcomate. I'm not sure about the specifics of these places. Maybe they were subject to a local governor, so option A would fit. Alternatively, perhaps they were more focused on labor projects.

Alternatively, some sources might say that the commoners were required to work on projects, but also paid taxes. If the question is about both goods and labor, then A would cover that.

So, considering all that, I think the correct answer is A: had to pay a high tax in goods and labor to the local governor.

The Aztecs had a structured society where commoners, known as macehualli, played a crucial role as farmers and artisans. They were obligated to pay tribute to the state, which included goods and labor. This system was managed through local governors, who collected taxes and oversaw the distribution of labor for public projects. While the Aztecs were known for their engineering feats, such as irrigation systems, the specific question focuses on the general living conditions of commoners in rural villages like Capilco and Cuexcomate. The most accurate description is that they had to pay high taxes in goods and labor to the local governor, reflecting the broader tribute system of the Aztec empire.
