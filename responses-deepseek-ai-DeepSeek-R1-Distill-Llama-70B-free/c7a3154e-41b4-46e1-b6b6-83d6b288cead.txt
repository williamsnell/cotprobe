Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about organ pipes and harmonics. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question says that the first five harmonics produced by an organ pipe open at both ends are 50 Hz, 100 Hz, 150 Hz, 200 Hz, and 250 Hz. Then, it asks which of these harmonics will survive once the pipe is closed at one end.

Wait, I remember that the type of pipe (whether it's open or closed at the ends) affects the harmonics it can produce. For an open pipe, which is open at both ends, the harmonics are all the integer multiples of the fundamental frequency. So the first harmonic is the fundamental (n=1), second harmonic n=2, etc. So their frequencies are f, 2f, 3f, 4f, 5f, and so on.

But when the pipe is closed at one end, it becomes a closed pipe. I think in that case, the harmonics are different. Oh right, for a pipe closed at one end, only the odd harmonics are present. Or wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Let me get this straight.

Wait, when a pipe is open at both ends, the harmonic series includes all integer multiples. So the harmonics are n=1,2,3,4,5... So frequencies like f, 2f, 3f, etc.

But when it's closed at one end, it's a pipe open at one end and closed at the other. In that case, I remember that the harmonics are the odd multiples only. So n=1,3,5,7... So the frequencies would be f, 3f, 5f, etc.

Wait, but wait, sometimes I get confused whether it's the odd or even ones. Let me think about the nodes and antinodes. In an open pipe, the ends are antinodes, so the nodes are at intervals of half wavelengths. For a closed pipe, one end is a node (since it's closed), and the other is an antinode. So the harmonics allowed are the ones that fit this condition.

So for a closed pipe, the length L relates to the wavelength λ as L = (2n+1)λ/4, where n starts at 0. So the harmonics are n = 1, 3, 5, etc. So yes, same as I thought: only the odd harmonics are present.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the pipe was initially open at both ends. So the given frequencies are the first five harmonics, which would be n=1,2,3,4,5. So their frequencies are 50, 100, 150, 200, 250 Hz.

So if the pipe is closed at one end, only the odd harmonics would survive. So which of these are odd?

Looking at the given harmonics: 50 is n=1 (odd), 100 is n=2 (even), 150 is n=3 (odd), 200 is n=4 (even), 250 is n=5 (odd). So when the pipe is closed, only the odd n's will survive. So 50, 150, 250 Hz would survive.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me make sure I'm not mixing up the terms. The fundamental frequency for an open pipe is f = v/(2L), where v is the speed of sound and L is the length. For a closed pipe, the fundamental is f = v/(4L), so the harmonics would be f, 3f, 5f, etc.

So if the original pipe is open, the fundamental is f = 50 Hz (since first harmonic is 50 Hz). So when it's closed, the new fundamental would be 25 Hz (since 50 was v/(2L), so v/(4L) is 25 Hz). So the harmonics would be 25, 75, 125, 175, 225, etc.

Wait, but that's a different scenario. Oh, wait no, the question is about which of the original harmonics survive when the pipe is changed from open to closed.

Wait, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. The point is, when you change the pipe's ends, some of the existing harmonics may no longer be supported.

Wait, perhaps another way: the original pipe, open at both ends, has frequencies at all multiples of 50 Hz. So 50, 100, 150, etc.

When it's closed at one end, the pipe can only support odd multiples of the new fundamental. But what's the new fundamental?

Wait, the fundamental for a closed pipe is f_closed = v/(4L). For an open pipe, it's f_open = v/(2L). So f_closed is half of f_open. So if the original f_open was 50 Hz, then f_closed would be 25 Hz.

Thus, the closed pipe's harmonics would be 25 Hz (n=1), 75 Hz (n=3), 125 (n=5), 175 (n=7), etc.

Looking at the original frequencies, which are 50, 100, 150, 200, 250.

Which of these match any of the closed pipe's harmonics? Let's see:

25 Hz: not in the original list.

75: no.

125: no, original is 150. Wait, 150 is 3*(50), which is 150 Hz. But in the closed case, 3*25=75, 5*25=125, 7*25=175, 9*25=225, etc.

Wait, but wait, the original frequencies are 50,100,150,200,250 Hz. The closed pipe's harmonics are 25,75,125,175,225,275, etc. So none of the original frequencies, except perhaps 150 Hz if any.

Wait, 150 Hz is 3*50. But in the closed pipe, the 3rd harmonic would be 3*25=75, 5th is 125, etc. So 150 isn't a multiple of 25 in the way the closed pipe operates. Because 25 * 6 = 150. But 6 is even; the closed pipe only allows odd multiples, so n=1,3,5, etc.

Wait, so 25*(2k+1), where k starts at 0. So 25*1=25, 25*3=75, 25*5=125, etc.

So 150 is 25*6. 6 is even, so that's a harmonic for the open pipe but not for the closed. So in the closed pipe, 150 isn't present.

Wait, so none of the original frequencies would be present in the closed pipe's harmonics except perhaps the fundamental of the closed pipe, which is 25 Hz, but 25 isn't in the list.

Wait, but that can't be right. Because the question gives options, and one of them must be correct.

Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the fundamental changes when the pipe is closed. Maybe the length remains the same, so the fundamental for the closed pipe would be half that of the open pipe. So if the open pipe's first harmonic is 50 Hz, the closed pipe's first harmonic would be 25 Hz, right?

But the point is, when you close one end, the possible standing waves are different. So when the pipe is open, it can produce all harmonics (n=1,2,3,4,5...). When closed, it can only produce the odd harmonics (n=1,3,5...), but relative to the new fundamental.

Wait, but the question is about which of the original harmonics would survive. So the original harmonics are 50,100,150,200,250. Now, which of these are odd multiples of the closed pipe's fundamental?

Wait, the closed pipe's fundamental is 25 Hz, as I said. So the harmonics are 25,75,125,175,225,275, etc.

Looking at the original list: 50, 100, 150, 200, 250.

Wait, 50 is 2*25, which is even, so it's not a harmonic of the closed pipe. 100 is 4*25, even. 150 is 6*25, even. 200 is 8*25, even. 250 is 10*25, even. So none of them are present. But that can't be right because option H says no harmonics survive, but I'm not sure if that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about it differently. Maybe when the pipe is closed, the harmonics are the same as the original odd harmonics. Wait, but the original pipe has harmonics at all multiples, so the odd ones are 50 (n=1), 150 (n=3), 250 (n=5). So when the pipe is closed, perhaps only these survive.

Wait, but if the pipe's length is the same, then when closed, the fundamental is 25 Hz, so the frequencies are 25,75,125,175,225, etc. So the original harmonics that are in this series would be 75, 225, etc., but these aren't in the given list. So perhaps none of the original harmonics survive.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. Wait, the original pipe is open, and the first five harmonics are 50,100,150,200,250. So the fundamental is 50 Hz.

If we close one end, the new fundamental is 25 Hz, and the harmonics are 25,75,125, etc.

So the original harmonics are 50 (n=1 for open), which is 2*25 → but in the closed pipe, 2*25 is 50, which is an even harmonic, which isn't allowed. So 50 won't be present.

Wait, but this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try a different approach.

When the pipe is open at both ends, the harmonics are all integers: f, 2f, 3f, etc.

When closed at one end, only the odd harmonics are allowed, so f_closed, 3f_closed, 5f_closed, etc.

But f_closed is half of f_open. So f_closed = f_open / 2.

So the frequencies for the closed pipe would be (f_open/2), 3*(f_open/2), 5*(f_open/2), etc.

So substituting f_open =50 Hz, the closed pipe's harmonics are 25 Hz, 75 Hz, 125 Hz, 175 Hz, 225 Hz, etc.

Now, the original harmonics were 50,100,150,200,250.

Which of these match any of the closed pipe's harmonics? Let's see:

50 → 2*25 → even multiple → not allowed.

100 → 4*25 → even → no.

150 →6*25→ even → no.

200 →8*25→ even→ no.

250→10*25→ even → no.

So none of the original frequencies are present in the closed pipe's harmonics. So the answer would be that no harmonics survive, which is option H.

But wait, let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps the fundamental of the closed pipe is the same as the original pipe's first harmonic.

Wait, no, because when you close one end, the length remains the same, so the fundamental changes. For an open pipe, fundamental is λ=2L, so f = v/(2L). For a closed pipe, λ=4L, so f = v/(4L) = (1/2)(v/(2L)) = f_open / 2.

So yes, the closed pipe's fundamental is half of the open pipe's.

So the closed pipe's harmonics are 25,75,125, etc.

The original pipe's harmonics are 50,100,150, etc.

So when the pipe is closed, the original harmonics (which are multiples of 50) don't match the closed pipe's harmonics (which are odd multiples of 25, i.e., 25,75,125, etc.). So none of the original harmonics are present in the closed pipe.

Wait, but wait another point: when you close the pipe, perhaps the existing harmonics change, but perhaps some of the original frequencies can be expressed as the new harmonics.

Alternatively, perhaps the original harmonics were n=1 to n=5 for the open pipe, which are 50,100,150,200,250.

When the pipe becomes closed, the allowed harmonics are m=1,3,5,... but in terms of the new fundamental. So the new fundamental is 25 Hz, so m=1 is 25, m=3 is 75, m=5 is 125, etc.

So the question is, do any of the original frequencies (50,100, etc.) match any of the new harmonics (25,75,125, etc.)?

Looking:

50: Is 50 present in new harmonics? 25*2=50, but m=2 is even, so no. So 50 is not allowed.

100: 25*4=100, m=4 even → no.

150: 25*6=150, m=6 even → no.

200: m=8 → even → no.

250: m=10 → even → no.

So none of the original harmonics are present.

Wait but the question says "the first five harmonics produced by an organ pipe open at both ends are 50 Hz, 100 Hz, 150 Hz, 200 Hz, and 250 Hz." So when the pipe is then closed, which of these survive.

So according to this, none survive, so the answer would be H: No harmonics will survive.

But wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Because the original pipe's harmonics are 50,100,150,200,250. When the pipe is closed, the possible harmonics are 25,75,125,175,225,275, etc.

So none of the original frequencies are in the closed pipe's harmonics. Therefore, all the given harmonics are even multiples of the closed pipe's fundamental (25 Hz), which are not allowed, as the closed pipe only allows odd multiples.

So yes, the correct answer is H: No harmonics will survive.
</think>

The problem involves determining which harmonics survive when an organ pipe, initially open at both ends, is closed at one end. For an open pipe, the harmonics are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency, i.e., \( f, 2f, 3f, 4f, 5f, \dots \). For a closed pipe, only the odd harmonics are allowed, i.e., \( f, 3f, 5f, 7f, \dots \), where the fundamental frequency is halved compared to the open pipe.

The first five harmonics of the open pipe are given as 50 Hz, 100 Hz, 150 Hz, 200 Hz, and 250 Hz. This indicates that the fundamental frequency of the open pipe is \( f_{\text{open}} = 50 \, \text{Hz} \). When the pipe is closed at one end, the fundamental frequency becomes \( f_{\text{closed}} = \frac{f_{\text{open}}}{2} = 25 \, \text{Hz} \). The harmonics of the closed pipe are then \( 25 \, \text{Hz}, 75 \, \text{Hz}, 125 \, \text{Hz}, 175 \, \text{Hz}, 225 \, \text{Hz}, \dots \), which are odd multiples of \( 25 \, \text{Hz} \).

Comparing the original harmonics (50 Hz, 100 Hz, 150 Hz, 200 Hz, 250 Hz) with the closed pipe's harmonics, none of the original frequencies match the closed pipe's harmonics. This is because the original frequencies are all even multiples of \( 25 \, \text{Hz} \), while the closed pipe only allows odd multiples. Therefore, no harmonics from the original list survive when the pipe is closed at one end.

The correct answer is:

**H: No harmonics will survive**
