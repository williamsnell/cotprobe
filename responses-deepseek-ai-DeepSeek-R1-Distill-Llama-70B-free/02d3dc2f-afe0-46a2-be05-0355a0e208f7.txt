Okay, so I've got this math problem in front of me about buying a bedroom set. Let me try to understand it step by step. The list price is $1010, but it's advertised for sale with a $35 reduction. So first, I think the sale price would be the list price minus $35. Let me calculate that: 1010 minus 35 is 975. So the sale price is $975. That seems straightforward.

Now, the question also mentions an installment plan. The plan requires a down payment of $337.60 and then 18 monthly payments of $43.61 each. I'm guessing the total amount paid under this plan is the down payment plus all the monthly payments combined. So I need to calculate that total and then find the finance charge.

Let me compute the total of the monthly payments first. There are 18 payments, each $43.61. So 18 multiplied by 43.61. Hmm, let me do this step by step. 18 times 40 is 720, and 18 times 3.61 is... wait, 3.61 times 18. Let me calculate that. 3 times 18 is 54, 0.61 times 18 is about 10.98. So adding those gives 54 + 10.98 = 64.98. So 720 + 64.98 equals 784.98. So the total for the monthly payments is $784.98.

Now, add the down payment to that. The down payment is $337.60. So 337.60 plus 784.98. Let's add them: 337 + 784 is 1121, and 0.60 + 0.98 is 1.58. So total is 1121 + 1.58 = 1122.58. So the total amount paid under the installment plan is $1122.58.

But the sale price is $975, so the finance charge must be the difference between the total paid and the sale price. So 1122.58 minus 975 equals... Let's see, 1122.58 minus 900 is 222.58, then minus another 75 would be 147.58. So the finance charge is $147.58.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check. The sale price we found was $975, and the finance charge is $147.58. Looking at the options, option I says sale price $975 and finance charge $147.58. Option E says the same sale price but a higher finance charge. Option J has a sale price of 1010, which I don't think is correct because the $35 reduction should apply.

So the correct answer should be option I. But let me double-check my calculations to be sure.

Wait, I calculated the sale price as 1010 - 35 = 975. Then total payments: 337.60 + (18 * 43.61). Let me recalculate 18*43.61 more precisely. 43.61 times 18: 40*18=720, 3.61*18=64.98. So 720+64.98=784.98. Then 784.98 + 337.60 = 1122.58.

Finance charge is 1122.58 - 975 = 147.58. So yes, that's correct. So option I is correct.

The list price of the bedroom set is $1010, and it is advertised with a $35 reduction. Therefore, the sale price is calculated as:

\[
\text{Sale Price} = \$1010 - \$35 = \$975
\]

The installment plan requires a down payment of $337.60 and 18 monthly payments of $43.61 each. To find the total amount paid under the installment plan, we calculate the total of the monthly payments and add the down payment:

\[
\text{Total Monthly Payments} = 18 \times \$43.61 = \$784.98
\]

\[
\text{Total Amount Paid} = \$337.60 + \$784.98 = \$1122.58
\]

The finance charge is the difference between the total amount paid and the sale price:

\[
\text{Finance Charge} = \$1122.58 - \$975 = \$147.58
\]

Thus, the sale price is $975, and the finance charge is $147.58. Comparing these values to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**I: Sale price is $975 and finance charge is $147.58.**
