Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question here, and I need to figure out which option is not a 'research purpose.' The options are A through J, each representing a different term. Let me start by recalling what each of these terms generally means, especially in the context of research.

First, I remember that research purposes usually include things like exploration, description, explanation, prediction, etc. These are common terms you hear in research methods. So let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Argumentation. Hmm, I'm not too sure about this one. I think argumentation is more about presenting arguments to support a point, maybe in debates or persuasive writing. I don't recall it being a primary research purpose, but I'm not certain. I'll keep this in mind and check others.

Option B: Exploration. Yes, I know this is a research purpose. It's when you're trying to explore a new topic or understand it better without a specific hypothesis. So exploration is definitely a research purpose.

Option C: Description. That's another one I'm sure about. Descriptive research aims to describe a population, situation, or phenomenon without manipulating variables. So description is a valid purpose.

Option D: Justification. Hmm, justification sounds like providing reasons or support for something. I'm not sure if that's considered a primary research purpose. It might be more of a component in argumentation or when discussing results, but I don't recall it being listed as a standalone research purpose. I'll note this and think more later.

Option E: Comprehension. Wait, comprehension is about understanding. I think in research, comprehension is similar to exploration or explanation, but I'm not sure if it's explicitly listed as a separate purpose. Maybe it's more of a general goal rather than a specific purpose.

Option F: Interpretation. Yes, interpretive research is a thing. It's about making sense of data, especially in qualitative research. So interpretation is definitely a research purpose.

Option G: Persuasion. Persuasion is about convincing others, which sounds more like argumentation. I don't think persuasion is a research purpose; it's more of a communication or rhetorical goal. So this might be the answer, but I'm not sure yet.

Option H: Prediction. Yes, predictive research aims to forecast outcomes based on data. So prediction is a valid purpose.

Option I: Triangulation. Wait, triangulation is a research method where you use multiple methods to increase validity. It's not a purpose but a technique. So triangulation isn't a research purpose. That might be the answer.

Option J: Explanation. Yes, explanatory research seeks to explain why something happens. So explanation is definitely a research purpose.

Now, reviewing the options, I'm considering which one isn't a research purpose. The options I'm unsure about are D (justification), G (persuasion), and I (triangulation).

Justification: Maybe in some contexts, like justifying a theory or approach, but I don't think it's a primary purpose.

Persuasion: I'm pretty sure this isn't a research purpose because research aims to discover, not persuade, although findings can be used to persuade.

Triangulation: This is definitely a method, not a purpose. So I think triangulation (option I) is not a research purpose.

Wait, but the question is asking which is NOT a research purpose. So the incorrect purpose would be triangulation.

Alternatively, let me think again. The other options:

A: Argumentation. Maybe in some contexts, like argumentative research approaches, but I'm not sure. Or perhaps in legal research, but generally, not a primary purpose.

D: Justification. Not a primary purpose, but more like a component.

G: Persuasion. Not a purpose; more of a goal in communication.

So between these, which is the correct answer.

I think triangulation is definitely not a purpose, so option I is the correct answer.

The question asks which of the given options is not a 'research purpose.' Research purposes typically include activities like exploration, description, explanation, prediction, and interpretation, which are directly related to the goals of conducting research. 

- **Option A (Argumentation):** While argumentation involves presenting arguments, it is not typically classified as a primary research purpose. 
- **Option B (Exploration):** This is a recognized research purpose, as it involves investigating new topics or phenomena.
- **Option C (Description):** Descriptive research is a valid purpose, focusing on detailing characteristics of a population or situation.
- **Option D (Justification):** Justification is more about providing reasons for something and is not commonly listed as a standalone research purpose.
- **Option E (Comprehension):** Comprehension is a general goal of understanding but is not typically identified as a distinct research purpose.
- **Option F (Interpretation):** Interpretative research is a valid purpose, especially in qualitative studies.
- **Option G (Persuasion):** Persuasion is more of a communication goal and not a research purpose.
- **Option H (Prediction):** Predictive research is a recognized purpose, aiming to forecast outcomes.
- **Option I (Triangulation):** Triangulation is a research method used to enhance validity, not a research purpose.
- **Option J (Explanation):** Explanatory research is a valid purpose, seeking to clarify why phenomena occur.

Among these, **triangulation (Option I)** stands out as it is a method rather than a purpose. Therefore, the correct answer is:

I
