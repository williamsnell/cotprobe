Okay, so I have this problem about heat loss from a circular hot air duct. It's split into three parts, a, b, and c. The question gives me some parameters and I need to compute the heat loss per unit area by convection and then by convection plus radiation, and then again with a different emissivity. Hmm.

Alright, let's start by understanding the given information. The duct is circular with a diameter of 3 feet. The surface is made of polished metal, which has an emissivity ε of 0.1. The surface temperature is 150°F, and the ambient temperature is 65°F. So, for part a, I need to calculate the convective heat loss per unit area. For part b, it's the same but including radiation. Then part c changes the emissivity to 0.95 because the metal is painted white.

I remember that the heat loss by convection is calculated using Newton's law of cooling. The formula is Q = h * A * (T_s - T_ambient), where h is the convective heat transfer coefficient, A is the area, and T_s and T_ambient are the surface and ambient temperatures, respectively.

But wait, the problem asks for the rate per unit area, so the A would cancel out, leaving Q per unit area as h*(T_s - T_ambient). So I just need to find h first.

Now, I need to find the convective heat transfer coefficient, h. Since it's a circular duct, I think it's a cylinder, so the flow is around a cylinder. But wait, the problem is about a duct, which might imply that it's more about the internal flow, but no, the question is about the duct losing heat to the surroundings, so it's external convection, like natural convection or forced? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify. Wait, but in typical HVAC ducts, the heat loss is often due to natural convection unless specified otherwise. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the duct is in a situation where the air is moving around it, so it's forced convection. Hmm.

Wait, I think in many cases like this, they use a standard correlation for the convective coefficient. For a circular cylinder in crossflow, the Nusselt number can be determined using a correlation. For example, the Churchill-Bernstein correlation for crossflow around a cylinder.

The formula for Nusselt number (Nu) is Nu = 0.3 + (0.62 * Re^0.5 * Pr^0.333)/(1 + (0.4/Pr)^(2/3)) ) * [1 + (Re/282000)^0.5/10]^0.1, but that's getting complicated. Alternatively, for a cylinder in crossflow, maybe I should use the Hilpert correlation, which is simpler.

Hilpert's correlation for Nu is: Nu = 0.25 * Re^0.5 * Pr^0.38 when Re is between 1e2 and 1e4. But I'm not sure about the exact range here. Alternatively, for a cylinder, another approach is to use the formula with Re and Pr. But wait, without knowing the velocity of the surrounding air, how can I compute Re? Oh wait, maybe the problem expects me to use a standard value for h. Because in some textbooks, there are typical h values given for certain situations.

Wait, the problem gives me the duct's diameter, which is 3 ft. So the diameter D is 3 ft. But without the air velocity or any other information, I can't compute Re. Hmm, that's a problem. Did I miss something in the question? Let me check. Oh, wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the duct is in still air, so it's natural convection. Hmm, that makes more sense. Because in forced convection, the velocity would be given, I think.

So if it's natural convection, the heat transfer coefficient is determined differently. The Grashof number comes into play. The formula for natural convection around a horizontal cylinder involves the Grashof number and the Prandtl number.

The Grashof number Gr is given by Gr = (g * β * ΔT * D^3 ) / ν^2, where g is the acceleration due to gravity, β is the volume expansion coefficient, ΔT is T_s - T_ambient, D is the diameter, and ν is the kinematic viscosity.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact correlation to use for a cylinder in natural convection. Alternatively, I remember that for a horizontal cylinder, the average Nusselt number can be estimated using the Churchill and Chu correlation: Nu = (Gr * Pr)^0.25 * [1 + (0.59/(Gr * Pr)^0.25)]^0.1.

Alternatively, another formula is Nu = 0.36 + 0.42 * (Gr*Pr)^0.25 / (1 + 0.413/Pr) when Gr*Pr is between 1e4 and 1e9.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed step by step.

First, let's compute the temperatures in absolute terms because all the properties depend on that. The surface temperature T_s is 150°F, which is (150 - 32)*5/9 = 65.56°C. Wait, but wait, no, in the context of heat transfer calculations, especially in English units, sometimes the film temperature is considered. The film temperature is the average of the surface and ambient temperatures. So T_film = (150 + 65)/2 = 107.5°F.

Wait, but for natural convection, I think the properties are evaluated at the film temperature. So I need to find the air properties at 107.5°F.

But wait, I'm not sure about the exact air properties. Let me think. Air at around 100°F has certain values for kinematic viscosity, thermal conductivity, and Prandtl number.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the correlations without getting into detailed property evaluations. But I think I need to find the Grashof number.

Wait, but perhaps I can remember some typical values. For example, in natural convection from a cylinder, h can be around 1-5 W/m²K, but that's in SI units. But the answer options are in Btu/ft²-hr, which is a bit tricky.

Wait, let me try to convert units. 1 Btu is approximately 1055.06 joules. 1 ft² is 0.0929 m². 1 hour is 3600 seconds.

So 1 Btu/ft²-hr is equal to (1/1055.06 J) / (0.0929 m² * 3600 s) ) = approx 1/(1055 * 0.0929 * 3600) J/(m²·s). Let's calculate that.

1055 * 0.0929 ≈ 98. So 98 * 3600 = 352,800. So 1 Btu/ft²-hr ≈ 1 / 352800 ≈ 2.835e-6 W/m²K. Wait, that's way too small. Did I do that right? Wait, no, wait: Let me think.

Wait, 1 Btu/ft²-hr is a unit of heat flux. So in terms of W/m²K, it's (1 Btu/(ft²·hr·°F)). Because the convection equation uses (T_s - T_ambient) in °F, so the h is in Btu/(ft²·hr·°F).

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me try again.

The heat flux is Q/A = h*(T_s - T_amb), where h is in Btu/(ft²·hr·°F). So, to convert h from W/(m²·K) to Btu/(ft²·hr·°F), I need to know the conversion factors.

Since 1 W = 3.41214 Btu/hr. 1 m² = 10.7639 ft². 1 K = 1 °F in terms of temperature difference (since a change of 1 K is a change of 1.8°F, but when calculating h, it's per degree, so perhaps the conversion is different). Hmm, maybe I should find a direct conversion factor.

Wait, here's a better approach. Let's find the conversion factor between W/(m²·K) and Btu/(ft²·hr·°F).

1 W = 3.41214 Btu/hr.

1 m² = 10.7639 ft².

1 K = 1.8 °F, but in terms of a temperature difference, 1 K = 1.8 °F. However, the heat transfer coefficient is based on the temperature difference per degree, so perhaps the factor is 1/(1.8) for K to °F.

So, 1 W/(m²·K) = 3.41214 Btu/(hr·m²·K) = 3.41214 / 10.7639 Btu/(hr·ft²·K) = 0.317 Btu/(ft²·hr·K). Then, since 1 K = 1.8 °F, to get it in terms of °F, we multiply by 1.8: 0.317 * 1.8 ≈ 0.5706 Btu/(ft²·hr·°F).

Wait, wait, no. Wait, let's say h is in W/(m²·K). To convert to Btu/(ft²·hr·°F), we have:

h [W/(m²·K)] * 3.41214 Btu/(W·hr) / (10.7639 ft²/m²) * (1 K / 1.8 °F) ) 

So the formula is h * (3.41214) / (10.7639) / (1.8) = h * 0.1601.

So, 1 W/(m²·K) = 0.1601 Btu/(ft²·hr·°F). So if I can find h in W/(m²·K), I can multiply by 0.1601 to get Btu/(ft²·hr·°F).

Now, back to the problem. Let's compute h for natural convection.

Gr is the Grashof number, which is g β ΔT D³ / ν².

But I need the properties at the film temperature. Film temperature T_film = (150 + 65)/2 = 107.5°F = (107.5 + 459.67) * 5/9 = let's compute that.

Wait, wait. To get absolute temperature in Kelvin, but perhaps it's easier to think in Rankine. Because in English units, the ideal gas law uses Rankine for absolute temperature.

So T_s = 150°F = 150 + 459.67 = 609.67 °R.

T_ambient = 65°F = 65 + 459.67 = 524.67 °R.

T_film = (609.67 + 524.67)/2 = 567.17 °R.

So at T_film = 567.17 °R, I need to find the air properties: kinematic viscosity ν, thermal conductivity k, and the Prandtl number Pr.

But I'm not exactly sure about the values. Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that at around 100°F (which is 333 K), the kinematic viscosity of air is about 0.000016 ft²/s, but I'm not certain. Let me think.

Wait, I remember that at 60°F (about 288 K), ν is around 0.0000172 ft²/s. At higher temperatures, ν increases. So at 100°F (311 K), it's about 0.000021 ft²/s. Wait, that seems a bit high. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for an approximate value.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for kinematic viscosity of air as a function of temperature. The formula is ν = 0.0000266 * T^(1.5) / (T + 243.07), where T is in Kelvin. Wait, that might be the Sutherland formula for viscosity, but let me check.

Wait, the Sutherland formula for dynamic viscosity μ is μ = 1.459e-6 * T^(1.5)/(T + 110.4), where T is in Kelvin.

So, since ν = μ / ρ, and for ideal gas, ρ = P/(R*T), but perhaps it's easier to compute ν in ft²/s using the Sutherland formula.

Wait, perhaps I can find the kinematic viscosity at T_film.

But maybe this is getting too complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can use an approximate value. Let's say that at T_film of 567.17 °R, which is (567.17 - 459.67) = 107.5°F, which is about 305 K.

At 305 K, the kinematic viscosity of air is approximately 0.000018 ft²/s. Let's say ν ≈ 0.000018 ft²/s.

The thermal conductivity k of air at this temperature is about 0.0145 Btu/(hr·ft·°F). I think at room temperature, it's about 0.0135, so at higher temp, maybe 0.0145.

The Prandtl number Pr is the ratio of dynamic viscosity to thermal diffusivity, which is Cp*μ/k. For air, Pr is around 0.7, regardless of temperature.

So, Pr = 0.7.

Now, compute Grashof number Gr = (g * β * ΔT * D^3) / ν².

But wait, β is the volume expansion coefficient. For air, β = 1/T, where T is in Rankine. So β = 1 / 567.17 °R ≈ 0.001764 (1/°R).

g is 32.174 ft/s².

ΔT = T_s - T_ambient = 150 - 65 = 85°F. But wait, in Grashof number, the temperature difference should be in Rankine, so 85°F = 85 + 459.67 = 544.67 °R.

Wait, no. Wait, the Grashof number uses the temperature difference in the same units as the absolute temperature. So since β is per Rankine, ΔT should be in Rankine.

So ΔT = 85°F = 85 + 459.67 = 544.67 °R.

Now, D is 3 ft.

Putting it all together:

Gr = (g * β * ΔT * D^3) / ν².

Plugging in the numbers:

g = 32.174 ft/s².

β = 1/567.17 ≈ 0.001764 1/°R.

ΔT = 544.67 °R.

D = 3 ft.

ν = 0.000018 ft²/s.

So,

Gr = (32.174) * (0.001764) * (544.67) * (3)^3 / (0.000018)^2.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute numerator:

32.174 * 0.001764 = approx 0.0567.

0.0567 * 544.67 ≈ 0.0567 * 540 ≈ 30.6 (exact: 544.67 * 0.0567 ≈ 30.88).

Then multiply by D^3, which is 27 (3^3=27): 30.88 * 27 ≈ 834.8.

Denominator: (0.000018)^2 = 0.000000000324 = 3.24e-10.

So Gr ≈ 834.8 / 3.24e-10 ≈ 2.578e12.

Wait, that seems really high. Maybe I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, let's recheck the numbers:

g = 32.174 ft/s².

β = 1/567.17 ≈ 0.001764 1/°R.

ΔT = 544.67 °R.

D^3 = 27 ft³.

ν² = (0.000018)^2 = 3.24e-10 ft⁴/s².

So,

Gr = (32.174) * (0.001764) * (544.67) * 27 / (3.24e-10).

Compute numerator:

32.174 * 0.001764 ≈ 0.0567.

0.0567 * 544.67 ≈ 30.88.

30.88 * 27 ≈ 834.96.

So numerator ≈ 834.96.

Denominator: 3.24e-10.

Gr ≈ 834.96 / 3.24e-10 ≈ 2.579e12.

Hmm, that seems extremely large. I'm probably making a mistake here. Wait, perhaps the Grashof number for a horizontal cylinder in natural convection isn't that high.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the units. Let me check the units.

g is in ft/s².

β is 1/°R.

ΔT is °R.

D is ft.

ν is ft²/s.

So the units of Gr would be (ft/s²) * (1/°R) * °R * ft^3 / (ft^4/s²) )= (ft/s²) * ft^3 * s² / ft^4 ) = (ft^4/s²) * s² / ft^4 ) = dimensionless. So that's correct.

But the Gr value is 2.58e12, which is very high. I think maybe my ν is incorrect. Maybe ν is smaller than 0.000018 ft²/s. Wait, at higher temperatures, ν increases, so if the film temperature is 107.5°F, ν should be higher than at 60°F. At 60°F, ν is around 0.0000172 ft²/s. At 100°F, maybe 0.000021 ft²/s. So perhaps I should use ν = 0.000021 ft²/s.

Let me recalculate with ν = 0.000021 ft²/s.

ν² = (0.000021)^2 = 4.41e-10.

Gr = 834.96 / 4.41e-10 ≈ 1.893e12.

Still a very high Gr. Hmm. Maybe I should look for a different approach. Alternatively, perhaps the correlation I'm using isn't appropriate for such a high Gr.

Wait, the Churchill and Chu correlation for a horizontal cylinder in natural convection is:

Nu = (Gr * Pr)^0.25 * [1 + (0.59/(Gr * Pr)^0.25)]^0.1.

So let's compute Gr * Pr.

Gr = 1.893e12.

Pr = 0.7.

Gr * Pr = 1.893e12 *
