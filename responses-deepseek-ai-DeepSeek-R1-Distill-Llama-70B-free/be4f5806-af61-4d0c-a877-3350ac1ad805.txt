Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the volume of a rectangular box and converting it into cubic centimeters and liters. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the volume of a rectangular box is found by multiplying its length, width, and height (or depth). The formula is Volume = length × width × height. 

The given dimensions are in inches: 5.00 inches wide, 8.00 inches long, and 6.0 inches deep. So I need to calculate the volume in cubic inches first. Let me plug those numbers in.

So 5 inches multiplied by 8 inches is 40, and then multiplied by 6 inches gives 240 cubic inches. Wait, but the options don't have 240, so I must be missing something here. Oh right, the question asks for the volume in cubic centimeters and liters, so I probably need to convert from cubic inches to cubic centimeters.

I recall that 1 inch is equal to 2.54 centimeters. So each dimension needs to be converted to centimeters before calculating the volume. Hmm, that makes sense because if I convert after calculating in inches, I might get a different result.

Let me do each conversion:

Width: 5.00 inches * 2.54 cm/inch = 12.7 cm.
Length: 8.00 inches * 2.54 cm/inch = 20.32 cm.
Depth: 6.0 inches * 2.54 cm/inch = 15.24 cm.

Now, calculate the volume in cubic centimeters by multiplying these together:
Volume = 12.7 cm * 20.32 cm * 15.24 cm.

Wait, that seems a bit tedious. Let me compute it step by step. 

First, multiply 12.7 and 20.32. Let me do 12.7 * 20 = 254, and 12.7 * 0.32 is about 4.064. Adding those gives 254 + 4.064 = 258.064. 

Now, multiply that by 15.24. Let me break this down. 258.064 * 15 is 3,870.96, and 258.064 * 0.24 is approximately 61.935. Adding those together gives 3,870.96 + 61.935 = 3,932.895 cubic centimeters.

Hmm, looking at the options, option J is 3936 cc, which is very close to my calculation. But wait, maybe I should be more precise with the calculations.

Let me recalculate 12.7 * 20.32 more accurately. 

12.7 * 20 is 254. 12.7 * 0.32 is 4.064. So yes, 258.064. Now, 258.064 * 15.24. Let me compute 258.064 * 15 = 3,870.96. 258.064 * 0.24 is 61.93 (since 0.2 * 258.064 is 51.6128 and 0.04*258.064 is 10.32256; adding them gives 61.93536). So total is 3,870.96 + 61.93536 = 3,932.89536 cm³.

Wait, but that's about 3932.9 cm³, which is approximately 3933 cm³. The closest option is J, which is 3936 cc. Hmm, why the slight difference? Maybe because of rounding during the conversion.

Wait another thought: Alternatively, maybe I should convert each inch to cm precisely and then multiply. Let me try that again.

Width: 5 inches * 2.54 = 12.7 cm exactly.
Length: 8 inches * 2.54 = 20.32 cm exactly.
Depth: 6 inches * 2.54 = 15.24 cm exactly.

Calculating 12.7 * 20.32 = let's do it precisely.

20.32 * 12.7:
20 * 12.7 = 254.0
0.32 * 12.7 = 4.064
Total: 254.0 + 4.064 = 258.064 cm².

Then, 258.064 * 15.24 = let's compute this:

First, 258.064 * 15 = 3,870.96 as before.

Now, 258.064 * 0.24 = Let's compute 258.064 * 0.2 = 51.6128 and 258.064 * 0.04 = 10.32256. Adding those gives 51.6128 + 10.32256 = 61.93536.

So total volume is 3,870.96 + 61.93536 = 3,932.89536 cm³. So approximately 3932.9 cm³.

But wait, looking at the options, option J is 3936 cc, which is 3.936 liters. My calculation is 3932.9, which is about 3933. So that's very close, perhaps due to rounding. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the initial volume in cubic inches is 5 * 8 *6 = 240 cubic inches. Then convert that to cubic centimeters.

I know that 1 inch = 2.54 cm, so 1 cubic inch is (2.54)^3 cm³.

Let me calculate (2.54)^3:

2.54 * 2.54 = 6.4516.

6.4516 * 2.54: Let's compute that.

6 * 2.54 = 15.24, 0.4516 * 2.54 ≈ 1.147 (since 0.4 *2.54=1.016, 0.05*2.54=0.127, 0.0016*2.54≈0.004064. So 1.016 + 0.127 = 1.143 + 0.004064 = 1.147064).

So 15.24 + 1.147064 ≈ 16.387064 cm³ per cubic inch.

So 240 cubic inches * 16.387064 cm³/cubic inch = ?

Let me compute 240 * 16.387064.

First, 200 *16.387064=3277.4128.

40 *16.387064=655.48256.

Adding them: 3277.4128 + 655.48256 = 3932.89536 cm³.

Same result as before. So 3932.89536 cm³, which is approximately 3932.9 cm³, or 3933 cm³ when rounded.

Looking at the options, option J is 3936 cc, which is a bit higher. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation would yield a slightly different number. Let me compute 2.54^3 more precisely.

2.54 * 2.54 = 6.4516.

6.4516 * 2.54:

Let me do it step by step.

6 * 2.54 = 15.24.

0.4 * 2.54 = 1.016.

0.05 *2.54=0.127.

0.0016 * 2.54=0.004064.

Wait, wait. Wait, 6.4516 is 6 + 0.4 + 0.05 + 0.0016.

Wait no, 6.4516 is 6 + 0.4516. So perhaps I should compute 6.4516 *2.54 as (6 + 0.4516) * 2.54 = 6*2.54 + 0.4516*2.54.

6*2.54=15.24.

0.4516 *2.54:

Let me compute 0.4 *2.54 = 1.016.

0.05 *2.54=0.127.

0.0016 *2.54=0.004064.

So adding those: 1.016 +0.127=1.143 +0.004064=1.147064.

So total is 15.24 +1.147064=16.387064 cm³ per cubic inch.

So 240 *16.387064 = 240 *16.387064.

As before, 240 *16 = 3840, 240 *0.387064 = let's see, 0.3 *240=72, 0.08*240=19.2, 0.007064*240≈1.69536. So 72+19.2=91.2 +1.69536=92.89536. So total 3840 +92.89536=3932.89536 cm³.

So about 3932.9 cm³, which is approximately 3933 cm³. None of the options exactly match this except option J, which is 3936 cc. So maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the volume in cubic inches multiplied by 16.387 to get cc, which gives 240 *16.387=3932.8, which rounds to 3933, but the closest option is J: 3936.

Wait, maybe I should check my calculation of 5*8*6.

5 *8 is 40, times 6 is 240. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, could I have made a mistake in the conversion factor? Let me double-check: 1 inch is exactly 2.54 cm. So 1 cubic inch is (2.54)^3 = 16.387064 cm³.

So 240 *16.387064 = 3932.89536 cm³, yes.

Looking at the answer options, option J is 3936 cc, which is 3936 cm³. Hmmm, that's 3.936 liters. That's very close to my calculation but a bit higher. Maybe because I approximated during the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate 240 * 16.387 precisely.

16.387064 multiplied by 240:

16 *240=3840.

0.387064 *240: Let's compute 0.3*240=72, 0.08*240=19.2, 0.007064*240=1.69536.

So 72 +19.2 =91.2 +1.69536=92.89536.

So 3840 +92.89536=3932.89536 cm³.

So 3932.89536 cm³ is approximately 3932.9 cm³, which would be 3933 cm³ when rounded to the nearest whole number. But none of the options have 3933. The closest is option J: 3936. Hmm.

Wait another thought: Perhaps I should calculate the dimensions more precisely.

Wait, 5.00 inches is exactly 12.7 cm (since 5 *2.54=12.7).

8.00 inches is 20.32 cm (8*2.54=20.32).

6.00 inches is 15.24 cm (6*2.54=15.24).

So Volume = 12.7 *20.32 *15.24.

Maybe I should compute 12.7 * 20.32 first.

12.7 *20.32:

Let me compute 12 *20.32 = 243.84.

0.7 *20.32 =14.224.

So 243.84 +14.224 =258.064 cm².

Now, multiply by 15.24:

258.064 *15.24.

Let me compute 258.064 *15 = 3870.96.

258.064 *0.24 = let's compute 258.064 *0.2=51.6128; 258.064 *0.04=10.32256. So 51.6128 +10.32256=61.93536.

Adding to 3870.96 gives 3870.96 +61.93536 =3932.89536 cm³.

Same result again. So 3932.89536 cm³, which is approximately 3932.9 cm³.

Looking at the options, option J is 3936 cc, which is a bit higher. So perhaps the question expects an approximate value, but why the difference?

Wait, perhaps the problem expects to round to a certain decimal place. Let me see.

If 3932.89536 is approx 3932.9 cm³, which is 3933 when rounded to the nearest whole number. But the option J is 3936, which is 3.936 liters, so 3936 cc.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the initial multiplication of 12.7 *20.32. Let me check that again.

12.7 *20.32:

12 *20.32 = 243.84.

0.7 *20.32 =14.224.

243.84 +14.224 =258.064. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use a calculator-like approach for 258.064 *15.24.

Wait, 258.064 *15 = 3870.96.

258.064 *0.24 =61.93536.

Total 3932.89536. So I think the correct calculation leads to approximately 3932.9 cm³, which is about 3933 cm³.

But in the options, the closest is J:3936. So perhaps the correct answer is J.

Wait, perhaps I should check the arithmetic again.

Wait, 5 inches is 12.7 cm, 8 inches is 20.32 cm, 6 inches is 15.24 cm.

Then 12.7 ×20.32 = ?

Let me compute 12.7 ×20 =254, 12.7 ×0.32=4.064. So 254 +4.064=258.064.

Then 258.064 ×15.24.

Breaking it down:

258.064 ×15 = 258.064 ×10 =2580.64, plus 258.064 ×5=1290.32. So 2580.64 +1290.32=3870.96.

Then 258.064 ×0.24.

Let me compute 258.064 ×0.2 =51.6128.

258.064 ×0.04=10.32256.

Adding them gives 51.6128 +10.32256=61.93536.

So 3870.96 +61.93536 =3932.89536 cm³.

So it's 3932.89536 cm³, which is approximately 3932.9 cc.

Looking at the options, J is 3936 cc, which is 3.936 liters. So perhaps due to rounding during the calculations, the answer is J.

Alternatively, perhaps the question expects to round to three significant figures. Let me see.

The given measurements are 5.00,8.00,6.0. So 5.00 has three sig figs, 8.00 has three, and 6.0 has two. So the volume should be reported to two sig figs, but wait, when multiplying, the result should have the same number of sig figs as the least precise measurement. So 6.0 has two sig figs, so the final volume should be two sig figs.

Wait, but in that case, 3932.9 would round to 3900, which is 3.9 liters. But none of the options have that. Hmm, perhaps the question isn't considering significant figures, just the numerical value.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the conversion. Let me try another approach: computing in liters directly.

Wait, 1 liter is 1000 cm³, so 3932.89536 cm³ is 3.93289 liters, which is approximately 3.933 liters. Looking at the options, option J is 3.936 liters. That's very close, but not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct calculation is to compute the volume in cubic inches first, then convert to liters. Because 1 liter is 1000 cm³, and 1 cubic inch is approximately 16.387 cm³, as before.

So 240 cubic inches *16.387 cm³/cubic inch = 3932.89536 cm³, which is 3.93289 liters. So about 3.933 liters. But the options have J as 3.936 liters. So perhaps it's rounded up or a slight calculation discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps the exact calculation for 2.54^3 is 16.387064, so 240 *16.387064 is 240*16.387064=3932.89536 cm³, which is 3.932895 liters, approximately 3.933 liters.

Looking at the options, J is 3.936 liters, which is 3936 cc. So perhaps the correct answer is J.

But wait, another thought: Maybe the inches are converted correctly, but perhaps I should compute each dimension to more decimal places. Let me check:

5 inches =5 *2.54=12.7 cm exactly.

8 inches=8*2.54=20.32 cm exactly.

6 inches=6*2.54=15.24 cm exactly.

So volume is 12.7 ×20.32 ×15.24.

Wait, perhaps doing the multiplication in a different order might help.

Compute 20.32 ×15.24 first.

20 *15=300, 20*0.24=4.8, 0.32*15=4.8, 0.32*0.24=0.0768.

Wait, perhaps better to compute 20.32 ×15.24.

20.32 ×15 = 304.8.

20.32 ×0.24 =4.8768.

So 304.8 +4.8768=309.6768 cm².

Now multiply by 12.7:

309.6768 ×12.7.

Compute 309.6768 ×10=3096.768.

309.6768 ×2=619.3536.

309.6768 ×0.7=216.77376.

Adding them together: 3096.768 +619.3536 = 3716.1216 +216.77376 =3932.89536 cm³.

Same result again. So it's definitely 3932.89536 cm³.

So the volume is approximately 3932.9 cm³, which is 3.9329 liters.

Looking at the options, the only one close is J: 3936 cc (3.936 liters). But why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps the question expects us to round to four significant figures. 3932.89536 rounds to 3933 cm³, which is 3.933 liters. But the options don't have that. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the
