Question:

A passage Jane Eyre is as follows. This was all the account I got from Mrs. Fairfax of her employer and mine. There are people who seem to have no notion of sketching a character, or observing and describing salient points, either in persons or things: the good lady evidently belonged to this class; my queries puzzled, but did not draw her out. Mr. Rochester was Mr. Rochester in her eyes, a gentleman, a landed proprietor‚Äìnothing more: she inquired and searched no further, and evidently wondered at my wish to gain a more definite notion of his identity. Mrs. Fairfax differs from the speaker in that Mrs. Fairfax

E: has more interest in the complexities of people's personalities
F: is more reserved in her observations
G: judges people by their social station in life

Answer:

Okay, so I need to figure out this question about Jane Eyre. The passage is about Mrs. Fairfax and the speaker, Jane, talking about Mr. Rochester. Let me read the passage again carefully.

The passage says that Mrs. Fairfax doesn't seem to have the ability to sketch a character or observe and describe important points about people or things. When Jane asks her questions about Mr. Rochester, Mrs. Fairfax is puzzled but doesn't provide much detail. To her, Mr. Rochester is just a gentleman and a landed proprietor, nothing more. She doesn't look deeper into his identity and is surprised that Jane wants a more definite notion of who he is.

So the question is asking how Mrs. Fairfax differs from the speaker, Jane. The options are from A to G. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: has a more critical view of people's character. Wait, but the passage says Mrs. Fairfax doesn't observe or sketch characters well. So she's not critical; she's the opposite. So A doesn't seem right.

Option B: is more willing to take people at face value. That makes sense because Mrs. Fairfax doesn't look beyond the surface. She sees Mr. Rochester as just a gentleman, not probing deeper. So Jane is trying to dig deeper, while Mrs. Fairfax accepts him as he appears.

Option C: is less skeptical about people's intentions. Hmm, the passage doesn't talk about skepticism. It's more about not observing details, so maybe C isn't the best fit.

Option D: has a more positive opinion of Mr. Rochester. The passage doesn't say if her opinion is more positive, just that she doesn't question his identity. So D might not be accurate.

Option E: has more interest in the complexities of people's personalities. No, the passage says she doesn't search further, so she's less interested in complexities. So E is the opposite.

Option F: is more reserved in her observations. Well, she doesn't make detailed observations, but being reserved is more about not speaking, which isn't exactly what's described here. So maybe not F.

Option G: judges people by their social station in life. Since she refers to him as a gentleman and landed proprietor, it seems like she's focusing on his social status. So G could be a possibility. But the question is about how she differs from Jane, who is trying to understand his character beyond that.

Wait, the main point is that Mrs. Fairfax doesn't look beyond the surface, taking people at face value. So B and G are both possible. Let me think. The passage says she doesn't observe salient points, implying she takes things as they are without deeper analysis. So B seems to fit better because it's about accepting without probing, while G is about judging based on social class, which is part of it but maybe not the main difference.

So I think the correct answer is B: is more willing to take people at face value.

The passage highlights that Mrs. Fairfax lacks the ability to observe or describe the deeper aspects of a person's character. She views Mr. Rochester simply as a gentleman and a landed proprietor without delving further into his identity. This contrasts with Jane, who seeks a more detailed understanding of his character. Among the options, the best fit is that Mrs. Fairfax is more willing to take people at face value, as she doesn't probe beyond the surface.

Answer: B
