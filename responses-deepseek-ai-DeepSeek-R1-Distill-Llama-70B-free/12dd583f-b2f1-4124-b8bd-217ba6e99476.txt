C: The isotope of mass 35amu occurs with 65% and the isotope of mass 37amu occurs with 35%
D: The isotope of mass 35amu occurs with 25% and the isotope of mass 37amu occurs with 75%
E: The isotope of mass 35amu occurs with 50% and the isotope of mass 37amu occurs with 50%
F: The isotope of mass 35amu occurs with 85% and the isotope of mass 37amu occurs with 15%
G: The isotope of mass 35amu occurs with 90% and the isotope of mass 37amu occurs with 10%
H: The isotope of mass 35amu occurs with 55% and the isotope of mass 37amu occurs with 45%
I: The isotope of mass 35amu occurs with 70% and the isotope of mass 37amu occurs with 30%

Okay, so I've got this problem about chlorine isotopes and their abundances. Hmm, I remember that chlorine has two main isotopes, one with atomic mass 35 and another with 37. The average atomic mass is given as 35.453 amu. I need to find out the percentage of each isotope in nature.

Wait, so how do I approach this? I think I should set up an equation. Let's say the abundance of Cl-35 is x%, and Cl-37 is y%. Since these are the only two isotopes, x + y should equal 100%.

The average atomic mass is the weighted average of the two isotopes. So the equation would be:

35x + 37y = 35.453 * 100

Because x and y are percentages. Oh wait, no, maybe I should express them as decimals. Like, x and y as fractions. Let me think again.

Let me correct that. Let me denote x as the fraction of Cl-35. Then the fraction of Cl-37 would be (1 - x). So the equation becomes:

35x + 37(1 - x) = 35.453

Expanding that, 35x + 37 -37x =35.453

Combine like terms: (35x -37x) +37 =35.453 → -2x +37 =35.453

Subtract 37 from both sides: -2x =35.453 -37 → -2x = -1.547

Divide both sides by -2: x = (-1.547)/(-2) → x = 0.7735. So that's 77.35% for Cl-35. Then Cl-37 would be 1 - 0.7735 = 0.2265 or 22.65%.

Looking at the options, option J says 77.35% and 22.65%, which matches this. So the answer must be J.

To determine the percent abundance of chlorine isotopes, we set up the following relationship based on the average atomic mass:

Let \( x \) be the fraction of Cl-35 and \( 1 - x \) be the fraction of Cl-37. The average atomic mass is given by:

\[
35x + 37(1 - x) = 35.453
\]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[
35x + 37 - 37x = 35.453
\]
\[
-2x + 37 = 35.453
\]
\[
-2x = 35.453 - 37
\]
\[
-2x = -1.547
\]
\[
x = \frac{-1.547}{-2} = 0.7735 \, \text{(or 77.35% for Cl-35)}
\]

The fraction of Cl-37 is:

\[
1 - x = 1 - 0.7735 = 0.2265 \, \text{(or 22.65% for Cl-37)}.
\]

Comparing with the options, the correct answer is **J: The isotope of mass 35 amu occurs with 77.35% and the isotope of mass 37 amu occurs with 22.65%**.

Answer: J
