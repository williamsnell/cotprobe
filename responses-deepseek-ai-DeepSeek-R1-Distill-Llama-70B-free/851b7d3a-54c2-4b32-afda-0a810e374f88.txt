Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with wave equations, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says a source particle is executing periodic motion defined by y = 6 sin(πt). It's sending out waves that travel at 6 cm per second through a homogeneous medium, like a stretched cord. I need to find the displacement of a second particle that's 80 cm away from the source one minute after the source started vibrating. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, okay, let's break this down. I remember that wave motion can be described by the wave equation, which relates the displacement of a point on the wave to the position and time. The general form is y = A sin(kx - ωt + φ), where A is the amplitude, k is the wave number, ω is the angular frequency, and φ is the phase constant.

Wait, so the source's motion is given as y = 6 sin(πt). That looks like the equation for the source's displacement at its position (x=0, I guess). So the amplitude A is 6 cm. The angular frequency ω for the source is π radians per second because the equation is sin(πt), so the coefficient of t is ω.

Now, the wave is traveling through the medium at a speed of 6 cm/s. I remember that the wave speed v is related to the angular frequency and the wave number k by the equation v = ω/k. So maybe I can find k from this relation.

Let me write down what I have so far:
- Amplitude (A) = 6 cm
- Angular frequency (ω) = π rad/s
- Wave speed (v) = 6 cm/s

So using v = ω/k, I can solve for k:
k = ω / v = π rad/s / 6 cm/s = π/6 rad/cm.

Wait, radian is a dimensionless unit, so units would be correct here. So k is π/6 per cm.

Now, the wave equation for a point at a distance x from the source would be y = A sin(kx - ωt + φ). But wait, the phase φ might be zero if the wave starts at the equilibrium position. So I'll assume φ is zero for simplicity.

So the equation becomes y = 6 sin(kx - ωt).

Wait, but the wave could be moving in the positive x direction, so maybe the equation is y = 6 sin(kx - ωt). Or perhaps it's (ωt - kx) depending on the direction, but I think the standard form is (kx - ωt) for a wave moving in the positive x direction. Or wait, no, sometimes it's written as (ωt - kx), which would represent a wave moving in the positive x. Hmm, I might need to double-check that. But for now, I'll proceed with y = 6 sin(kx - ωt) because that's the form I remember for a wave moving in the positive x direction.

Wait, wait, another thought. The source is at x=0, and the wave is moving outward. So for a point at x=80 cm away, the wave would reach there after some time. But in this problem, we're looking at a time of one minute, which is 60 seconds, so t=60 s.

Wait, the problem states that the source began to vibrate, and we're looking at the displacement after one minute. So the wave has had time to travel to the second particle.

Wait, the distance between the source and the second particle is 80 cm, and the wave speed is 6 cm/s. So the time it takes for the wave to reach the second particle is distance divided by speed: 80 cm / 6 cm/s ≈ 13.333 seconds.

So, after 13.333 seconds, the wave reaches the second particle. But since we're looking at t = 60 seconds, which is much later than 13.333 s, the wave has definitely reached that point.

Now, the displacement of the second particle at t=60 s is given by plugging x=80 cm and t=60 s into the wave equation.

So let me write the wave equation again:

y(x, t) = 6 sin(kx - ωt)

We have k = π/6 rad/cm, ω = π rad/s.

So substituting x=80 cm and t=60 s:

y = 6 sin( (π/6)*80 - π*60 )

Let me compute the argument inside the sine function.

First, compute (π/6)*80: 80 divided by 6 is approximately 13.3333, so 13.3333 * π.

Then subtract π*60: which is 60π.

So the argument becomes 13.3333π - 60π = (13.3333 - 60)π = (-46.6667)π.

Wait, that's a negative angle, but sine is an odd function, so sin(-θ) = -sinθ. So sin(-46.6667π) = -sin(46.6667π).

But sine has a period of 2π, so I can subtract multiples of 2π to find an equivalent angle between 0 and 2π.

Let me compute 46.6667π divided by 2π to find how many full cycles that is.

46.6667π / 2π = 23.33335.

So that's 23 full cycles and 0.33335 of a cycle. Since each full cycle brings it back to the same value, the sine function will be the same as sin(0.33335 * 2π) but with a sign based on the number of cycles.

Wait, wait, 46.6667π is equal to (23 * 2π) + (0.6667π), because 23*2π=46π, so 46.6667π is 46π + 0.6667π, which is 23*2π + 2π/3.

Wait, 0.6667 is approximately 2/3, since 2/3 ≈ 0.6667. So 0.6667π = (2π/3).

So sin(46.6667π) = sin(23*2π + 2π/3) = sin(2π/3), because sine is periodic with period 2π.

Similarly, sin(-46.6667π) = -sin(46.6667π) = -sin(2π/3).

Now, sin(2π/3) is equal to sin(60 degrees) because 2π/3 is 120 degrees. Wait, no: 2π/3 is 120 degrees. Sin(120 degrees) is √3/2.

Wait, no, wait. 60 degrees is π/3, which is 3pi/6, and 120 is 2pi/3. So yes, sin(2pi/3) is sqrt(3)/2. So:

sin(-46.6667π) = -sin(2pi/3) = -sqrt(3)/2.

So the displacement y is 6 times that.

So y = 6 * (-sqrt(3)/2) = -3*sqrt(3) cm.

Wait, but looking at the answer options, I don't see a negative value. All the options are positive except maybe option J, which is 0. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the sign somewhere.

Wait, but displacement is a vector quantity, but in this case, the options are all magnitudes. Or perhaps the problem is considering the magnitude, but the negative sign indicates direction, which might not be relevant here. Alternatively, maybe I made an error in the wave equation's form.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the wave equation should be written as y = A sin(ωt - kx + φ), which might change the sign. Let me think about the direction of propagation.

The standard wave equation for a wave moving in the positive x direction is y = A sin(kx - ωt + φ). But sometimes it's written as y = A sin(ωt - kx + φ), which would also imply a wave moving in the positive x direction because as t increases, the argument increases, requiring the wave to move in the positive x direction to maintain the same phase.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The general form is y(x,t) = A sin(kx - ωt) for a wave moving in the +x direction. Because for a particular phase, say kx - ωt = constant, solving for x gives x = (ωt + constant)/k, which increases with t, so the wave moves in +x.

Alternatively, if it's ωt - kx, then the phase is constant when x increases with t, so that also represents a wave moving in +x direction. So the two forms are equivalent, differing only by a phase shift, perhaps.

Wait, so this might mean that I could have written the wave equation as y = 6 sin(ωt - kx), which would be equivalent to y = 6 sin( (π t) - (π/6)x ). Let me see what happens if I use that form.

So plugging in x=80 cm, t=60 s:

y = 6 sin(π*60 - (π/6)*80 )

Compute the argument:

π*60 = 60π

(π/6)*80 = (80/6)π ≈ 13.3333π

So the argument is 60π - 13.3333π = 46.6667π.

Which is the same as before, 46.6667π.

Which, as before, is an angle that reduces to 2π/3 when considering periodicity, so sin(46.6667π) = sin(2π/3) = sqrt(3)/2.

Thus, y = 6*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3*sqrt(3) ≈ 5.196 cm.

Wait, but in the previous approach with the other form of the wave equation, I got a negative value. So which one is correct?

Hmm, perhaps the phase was different. Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the direction in which the wave is moving. Wait, but in both cases, the magnitude is the same, only the sign differs. But the problem might just be asking for the magnitude of the displacement. Or perhaps I should take the absolute value. But the options include positive values, so let me check.

Wait, let me re-examine the initial wave equation. The source particle's motion is given as y = 6 sin(πt). So at x=0, the equation becomes y = 6 sin(-ωt) if we use the form y = A sin(kx - ωt). Wait, no, because at x=0, kx is zero, so y = 6 sin(-ωt). But that would give y = 6 sin(-πt) = -6 sin(πt), which contradicts the given source motion of y = 6 sin(πt). So perhaps I used the wrong form of the wave equation.

Ah, that's a problem! So if the source's equation is y = 6 sin(πt), then at x=0, the wave equation should reduce to that. So let's see.

Using the wave equation y = A sin(kx - ωt + φ), at x=0, it becomes y = A sin(-ωt + φ). We want this to equal 6 sin(πt). So:

6 sin(πt) = A sin(-ωt + φ)

Comparing, A must be 6, and the argument inside sine should be πt + some phase. But sin(-ωt + φ) = sin(πt). So for this to hold, we can set -ωt + φ = πt + 2πn, where n is an integer, but that would require ω to satisfy -ω = π, so ω = -π rad/s, which doesn't make sense because angular frequency is positive. Alternatively, perhaps I can adjust the phase.

Wait, maybe I should have the wave equation as y = 6 sin(ωt - kx + φ). Let's try that.

At x=0, y = 6 sin(ωt + φ). We want this to equal 6 sin(πt), so ω must be π rad/s, and φ must be zero. So the wave equation would be y = 6 sin(πt - kx).

Then, plugging in x=80 cm and t=60 s:

y = 6 sin(π*60 - (π/6)*80 )

Compute the argument:

π*60 = 60π

(π/6)*80 = (80/6)π ≈ 13.3333π

So the argument is 60π - 13.3333π = 46.6667π.

As before, 46.6667π is 23*2π + 2π/3, so it's equivalent to 2π/3.

So sin(2π/3) is sqrt(3)/2, so y = 6*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3*sqrt(3) cm, which is approximately 5.196 cm.

Looking at the options, option D is 5.2 cm, which matches this value.

Wait, but earlier when I used the other form of the wave equation, I had a negative displacement. But since the wave equation is written as y = 6 sin(πt - kx), the displacement is positive 5.196 cm, which rounds to 5.2 cm, option D.

So the correct answer should be D: 5.2 cm.

But wait, before I get too confident, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Let me go through the steps again.

1. Given: source y = 6 sin(πt). So ω = π rad/s.

2. Wave speed v = 6 cm/s. So v = ω/k → k = ω/v = π /6 cm⁻¹.

3. The wave equation is y(x,t) = 6 sin(πt - (π/6)x). Because at x=0, it should match the source's motion.

4. The second particle is at x=80 cm, t=60 s.

5. Plugging in: y = 6 sin(π*60 - (π/6)*80 )

6. Compute the argument: 60π - (80/6)π = 60π - 13.3333π = 46.6667π.

7. 46.6667π divided by 2π is 23.3333, so the fractional part is 0.3333, which is 1/3. So 46.6667π = 23*2π + (2π/3).

8. Sin(2π/3) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

9. y = 6 * 0.8660 ≈ 5.196 cm, which is approximately 5.2 cm.

Yes, that seems correct. So the answer is D:5.2 cm.
</think>

To solve the problem, we start with the given information:

1. The source particle's motion is described by \( y = 6 \sin(\pi t) \), where the amplitude \( A = 6 \, \text{cm} \) and the angular frequency \( \omega = \pi \, \text{rad/s} \).

2. The wave travels through the medium at a speed of \( v = 6 \, \text{cm/s} \). Using the relation \( v = \omega / k \), we calculate the wave number \( k \):
   \[
   k = \frac{\omega}{v} = \frac{\pi}{6} \, \text{rad/cm}.
   \]

3. The wave equation for a point at a distance \( x \) from the source is:
   \[
   y(x, t) = 6 \sin(\pi t - kx).
   \]

4. At \( t = 60 \, \text{s} \) and \( x = 80 \, \text{cm} \), substitute these values into the wave equation:
   \[
   y = 6 \sin\left(\pi \cdot 60 - \frac{\pi}{6} \cdot 80\right).
   \]

5. Simplify the argument of the sine function:
   \[
   \pi \cdot 60 = 60\pi, \quad \frac{\pi}{6} \cdot 80 = \frac{80\pi}{6} \approx 13.333\pi,
   \]
   \[
   \text{Argument} = 60\pi - 13.333\pi = 46.6667\pi.
   \]

6. Reduce \( 46.6667\pi \) modulo \( 2\pi \):
   \[
   46.6667\pi = 23 \cdot 2\pi + \frac{2\pi}{3}.
   \]
   Since sine is periodic with period \( 2\pi \), we only need to evaluate \( \sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right) \).

7. Evaluate \( \sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right) \):
   \[
   \sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
   \]

8. Calculate the displacement:
   \[
   y = 6 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 3\sqrt{3} \, \text{cm} \approx 5.196 \, \text{cm}.
   \]

9. Comparing this result to the options, the closest match is \( 5.2 \, \text{cm} \), which corresponds to option **D**.

Thus, the displacement of the second particle 80 cm from the source one minute after the source began to vibrate is approximately **5.2 cm**.
