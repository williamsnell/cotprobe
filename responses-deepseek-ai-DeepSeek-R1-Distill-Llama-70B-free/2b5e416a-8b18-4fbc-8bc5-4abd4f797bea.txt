Okay, so I've got this problem here about markdowns on a shirt. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my retail math, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The problem says the shirt originally sold for $6.75. Then during a sale, it was reduced to $4.50. After the sale, the price went up to $5.50. I need to find the gross and net markdown in dollars and the net markdown as a percentage of the current price.

Wait, I remember that gross markdown is the total reduction from the original price to the sale price, right? So that's the difference between the original and the sale price. Let me calculate that. The original is $6.75, sale is $4.50. So 6.75 minus 4.50 is $2.25. So the gross markdown is $2.25. That seems straightforward.

Now, net markdown. I think net markdown is the difference between the original price and the final price after everything. Because after the sale, the price went back up to $5.50. So the net markdown would be the original price minus the current price. That's 6.75 minus 5.50, which is $1.25. So net markdown is $1.25.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes net markdown can be calculated differently. No, wait, I think my approach is correct. Gross markdown is the total taken off during the sale, and net is the overall change from original to current price.

Now, the percentage part. The net markdown percentage is the net markdown divided by the current price, right? Because it's the percentage relative to what the customer is paying now. So that's $1.25 divided by $5.50. Let me do that calculation.

1.25 divided by 5.50. Hmm, 5.50 goes into 1.25 how many times? Let me think, 5.50 is larger than 1.25, so it's 0. something. Let me compute it. 1.25 / 5.50 equals approximately 0.22727... So that's about 22.727%. Rounding that, it's usually to one decimal place, so 22.7%.

Wait, let me make sure about the percentage. Oh wait, sometimes markdown percentages are calculated based on the original price, but I think in this case, the question specifies it's the net markdown as a percent of the current price. So yes, using the current price as the base is correct.

So putting it all together:

Gross Markdown: $2.25

Net Markdown: $1.25

Net Markdown Percentage: 22.7%

Wait, looking at the options, let me check each choice.

Option C says Gross is $2.25, Net is $1.25, and percentage 27.2%. That's different. Option D: same gross and net, but percentage 22.7%. Oh wait, that's what I calculated.

Option D: Gross $2.25, Net $1.25, 22.7%.

Wait, but let me double-check. The net markdown is the difference from original to current. 6.75 - 5.50 = 1.25, that's correct. Then 1.25 / 5.50 = 0.22727, which is 22.7%, yes.

So the correct answer should be option D.

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the gross markdown, net markdown, and the net markdown percentage based on the given prices:

1. **Gross Markdown**: This is the reduction from the original price to the sale price.  
   \[
   \text{Gross Markdown} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Sale Price} = \$6.75 - \$4.50 = \$2.25
   \]

2. **Net Markdown**: This is the reduction from the original price to the current price after the sale.  
   \[
   \text{Net Markdown} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Current Price} = \$6.75 - \$5.50 = \$1.25
   \]

3. **Net Markdown Percentage**: This is the net markdown expressed as a percentage of the current price.  
   \[
   \text{Net Markdown Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Net Markdown}}{\text{Current Price}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{\$1.25}{\$5.50} \right) \times 100 \approx 22.7\%
   \]

From the calculations:
- Gross Markdown: \$2.25  
- Net Markdown: \$1.25  
- Net Markdown Percentage: 22.7%  

Comparing these values with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**D: Gross Markdown: \$2.25, Net Markdown: \$1.25, Net Markdown Percentage: 22.7%**
