Okay, so I have this question here about life expectancy across different countries as of 2019. I need to figure out which country among the options has the lowest life expectancy. The options are Australia, Japan, United States, Canada, Iran, Germany, Brazil, Russia, China, and Mexico.

Hmm, I remember that life expectancy varies a lot between countries based on factors like healthcare, lifestyle, economy, and other social determinants. Let me think about what I know about each of these countries.

First, Japan is famous for having one of the highest life expectancies in the world. I think it's around 85 years or so. So definitely not Japan. Australia is also a developed country with good healthcare, so their life expectancy should be high too, maybe around the high 80s.

The United States has a pretty high life expectancy, but I've heard it's slightly lower than some other developed countries because of factors like obesity and healthcare access issues. Maybe around 78-80 years. Canada is similar, probably a bit higher than the US because of their healthcare system. Maybe mid-80s? Or wait, maybe not as high as Japan.

Germany is another developed country, so I expect their life expectancy to be high as well, probably around 80 years or more.

Now, looking at the other countries: Brazil, Russia, Iran, China, and Mexico. These are more diverse. I think Russia has had some issues with life expectancy, especially among men, due to high rates of alcohol consumption and heart diseases. I remember reading that Russian life expectancy can be lower than other developed nations, maybe around 70s or even lower.

China has been improving its life expectancy, probably into the mid-70s. Mexico's life expectancy is probably higher than some developing countries, maybe around 75-77 years.

Iran's life expectancy is something I'm less sure about. I think it's around 75-76 years. Brazil's might be similar, maybe a bit lower or higher depending on economic factors.

So putting it all together, the countries with the lowest life expectancy among the options are likely to be Russia, maybe Iran, Brazil, or China. But I think Russia's is lower. Wait, I remember that Russia's life expectancy for males is particularly low, but overall, maybe around 72-73 years. Whereas countries like Brazil and China might be a bit higher.

Wait, let me think again. I think in 2019, Russia's average life expectancy was around 73 years, while China was about 77, Brazil around 75, maybe. So Russia would be the lowest among these.

Looking back at the options, the choices are A: Australia, B: Japan, C: US, D: Canada, E: Iran, F: Germany, G: Brazil, H: Russia, I: China, J: Mexico.

So the lowest would be Russia, which is option H.

As of 2019, Russia had the lowest life expectancy among the listed countries, primarily due to factors such as high rates of alcohol consumption and cardiovascular diseases, particularly affecting male life expectancy. 

Answer: H
