Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the volume of a solid bounded by an elliptical paraboloid, a plane, and the coordinate planes. Hmm, let me try to understand the setup first.

The elliptical paraboloid is given by z = 2x² + y² + 1. The plane is x + y = 1, and the coordinate planes are x=0, y=0, and z=0. So the solid is in the first octant, bounded by these surfaces.

I think I should sketch the region to visualize it better. The coordinate planes (x=0, y=0, z=0) mean we're dealing with the area where x, y, and z are all positive. The plane x + y = 1 will intersect the x-axis at (1,0,0) and the y-axis at (0,1,0), forming a line in the xy-plane. But wait, since we're dealing with 3D, the plane x + y =1 is actually a flat surface that extends infinitely, but in this case, it's bounded by the other surfaces.

The paraboloid z = 2x² + y² +1 opens upwards. At x=0, y=0, z is 1. As x and y increase, z increases as well. So the solid is kind of sitting above the xy-plane, bounded below by this paraboloid and above by the plane x+y=1. But wait, no, wait. Wait, the plane equation is x + y =1, which when z is involved, perhaps I should express it differently. Oh wait, no, the plane equation is given as x + y =1, which in 3D would mean z can be any value. Wait, no, the plane equation would be x + y = 1 for all z, but in this case, the solid is bounded by this plane, so perhaps it's the intersection that matters.

Wait, maybe I should clarify the boundaries. The solid is bounded below by the elliptical paraboloid z = 2x² + y² +1, and above by the plane. Wait no, let me think again. The plane x + y =1 would, in 3D, be a vertical plane. So the solid is the region where z is between the paraboloid and the plane, but wait, the plane is given as x + y =1, which doesn't directly involve z. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the boundaries.

Wait, perhaps the solid is bounded above by the plane z = something. Wait, no, the plane is x + y =1, so maybe the solid lies where x + y ≤1, and z is between the paraboloid and another surface. Wait, perhaps the solid is bounded by the paraboloid below and the plane above, but that doesn't make sense because the plane x + y =1 is a function of x and y, not of z. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem states that the solid is bounded by the elliptical paraboloid, the plane x + y =1, and the coordinate planes. So the coordinate planes are x=0, y=0, z=0. So in the first octant. The plane x + y =1 is another boundary. So the region is where x ≥0, y ≥0, z ≥0, and x + y ≤1. But where does the paraboloid come into play? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the solid is bounded below by the paraboloid and above by the plane. Wait, but the paraboloid is z = 2x² + y² +1. So for any (x,y), the z starts at that value and goes up to where the plane is. Wait, but the plane x + y =1 doesn't directly give a z value. Oh, maybe I'm supposed to find where z is between the paraboloid and the plane, but that doesn't fit because the plane equation is x + y =1, which doesn't specify z.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the plane is z =1 - x - y? No, that's not correct because the equation is x + y =1, which in 3D would require solving for z, but it's not given. Wait, perhaps the plane is x + y =1, and it's in 3D, so z can be anything, but that doesn't make sense as a boundary for the solid. Alternatively, maybe the plane is intended to be z =1 - x - y, but that's not what's given. Hmm, perhaps I should read the problem again.

Wait, the problem says the solid is bounded by the elliptical paraboloid z=2x² + y² +1, the plane x+y=1, and the coordinate planes. So the plane x + y =1, in 3D, would be a vertical plane that cuts through the x and y axes at (1,0,z) and (0,1,z) for any z. But since the coordinate planes are x=0, y=0, and z=0, the region is in the first octant. So perhaps the solid is bounded below by the paraboloid and above by the plane x + y =1, but that still doesn't directly give a z limit. Hmm, I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, maybe I need to express the plane equation differently. Since the plane is x + y =1, perhaps it's better to think of it as a boundary in the xy-plane, but that's when z=0. But the solid is bounded by the coordinate planes, so maybe the plane x + y =1 intersects the paraboloid, and the volume is enclosed between the paraboloid, the plane, and the coordinate planes. Hmm, perhaps I should find the projection of the intersection onto the xy-plane.

Alternatively, perhaps the plane x + y =1 is a boundary in the xy-plane, but that doesn't make sense because x + y =1 in 3D is a vertical plane. Wait, maybe the solid lies between the paraboloid and the plane, but I'm not sure how to set up the limits for integration.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the region in the xy-plane first. The projection onto the xy-plane would be where x + y ≤1, with x ≥0 and y ≥0. So the region is a triangle with vertices at (0,0), (1,0), and (0,1). Then, for each point (x,y) in this triangle, the z goes from the paraboloid z=2x² + y² +1 up to... Wait, but what's the upper z boundary? Because the plane x + y =1 is a vertical plane, not a function of z, so perhaps the upper limit for z isn't bounded by it. That doesn't make sense. I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the solid is bounded above by the plane z = something. Alternatively, maybe the solid is bounded by the paraboloid below, the plane x + y =1, and the coordinate planes. So perhaps the plane x + y =1 is cutting through the paraboloid, and the volume is between z=0 (the xy-plane) and the paraboloid, but limited by x + y ≤1. No, because the paraboloid is z = 2x² + y² +1, which is always above z=1.

Wait, maybe it's better to set up the triple integral to find the volume. The volume would be the integral over x, y, z of dz dy dx, with limits determined by the boundaries.

So, for the region, x goes from 0 to 1 (since x + y ≤1 and x ≥0), and for each x, y goes from 0 to 1 - x.

Then, for each (x,y), z is bounded below by the paraboloid z = 2x² + y² +1 and above by... Wait, what's the upper limit for z? The plane x + y =1 is a vertical plane, but it doesn't impose a z limit. So maybe the upper z is determined by another condition. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the solid is bounded by the paraboloid below, the plane x + y =1, and the coordinate planes x=0, y=0, z=0. But z=0 would be below the paraboloid since the paraboloid is at z=1 when x=0 and y=0. So perhaps the solid is between the paraboloid and the plane, but I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps the plane is intended to be z = 1 - x - y. But the problem states the plane is x + y =1, so that's not correct. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the solid is bounded above by the plane z = f(x,y) where x + y ≤1. Wait, but the plane equation is x + y =1, so maybe the projection onto the xy-plane is where x + y ≤1, and for each (x,y) in that region, z goes from the paraboloid up to the plane, but the plane's equation doesn't involve z, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The solid is bounded by the elliptical paraboloid z=2x² + y² +1, the plane x + y =1, and the coordinate planes x=0, y=0, z=0.

Wait, perhaps the plane x + y =1 and the paraboloid intersect, and the region is bounded between them. But I need to find where they intersect to determine the limits.

Wait, to find the intersection curve of the paraboloid and the plane, substitute x + y =1 into the paraboloid equation. But wait, the paraboloid is z = 2x² + y² +1. The plane is x + y =1, but it doesn't specify z. So perhaps the intersection is along the line where x + y =1, but that doesn't directly affect z. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the solid is the region where z is between the paraboloid and the plane x + y =1, but the plane doesn't give a z value. Maybe I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the plane is x + y =1, and the solid lies in the region where x + y ≤1, bounded below by the paraboloid and above by the plane in terms of z. But the plane equation doesn't involve z, so that can't be right.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the plane x + y =1 intersects the paraboloid z=2x² + y² +1, and the volume is bounded between the paraboloid and the plane. Let me try that.

So, to find the intersection, set x + y =1, then express y =1 -x, and substitute into the paraboloid equation.

So substituting y=1 -x into z =2x² + (1 -x)² +1.

Let me compute that:

z = 2x² + (1 - 2x + x²) +1 = 2x² +1 -2x +x² +1 = 3x² -2x +2.

So the curve of intersection is z =3x² -2x +2, with y=1 -x, and x between 0 and 1.

Wait, but if that's the case, then the solid is bounded below by the paraboloid z=2x² + y² +1 and above by the plane's intersection curve, which would be a curve, not a plane. Hmm, perhaps that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe the solid lies between the paraboloid and the plane x + y =1 in such a way that for each (x,y) in the region x + y ≤1, the z ranges from the paraboloid up to the plane. But since the plane doesn't involve z, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the plane is intended to be z =1 - x - y, but the problem says x + y =1. So maybe I should proceed with that assumption, even though it's not stated. Let me try that.

Assuming the upper boundary is z =1 -x - y, then the volume would be the integral over x from 0 to1, y from 0 to1 -x, and z from the paraboloid up to z=1 -x - y.

So the volume V would be the triple integral over this region:

V = ∫ (x=0 to1) ∫ (y=0 to1 -x) ∫ (z=2x² + y² +1 to 1 -x - y) dz dy dx.

But wait, that doesn't make sense because 2x² + y² +1 is greater than 1 when x and y are positive. For example, at x=0, y=0, the paraboloid is at z=1, but the upper limit would be z=1 -0 -0=1, so the lower and upper z limits are the same, which would give zero volume. That can't be right, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Hmm, this is confusing. Let me try another approach. Maybe the plane is z=1 -x -y, and the problem statement had a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the solid is bounded by the paraboloid below, the plane x + y + z=1, but that's not what's given.

Wait, maybe I should visualize the region again. The paraboloid z=2x² + y² +1 is above z=1 everywhere, because 2x² and y² are always non-negative. So if the solid is bounded below by this paraboloid, then the z starts at 1 and goes up. But the plane x + y=1 doesn't impose a z limit, so maybe the solid is unbounded above, which can't be, as the volume would be infinite.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the boundaries. Maybe the solid is bounded above by the plane x + y=1, which would be a vertical plane, but that doesn't set a z limit. Alternatively, perhaps the plane is x + y=1 in the xy-plane, which is z=0. No, that's not right either.

I'm stuck here. Maybe I should look for another way to approach this. Perhaps the projection onto the xy-plane is the region x + y ≤1, x ≥0, y ≥0, and for each (x,y) in this region, z is bounded below by the paraboloid and above by the plane's z value, but the plane's equation doesn't give a z. So perhaps the plane is not the upper boundary for z but a boundary in another way.

Wait, perhaps the solid is bounded by the paraboloid, the plane, and the coordinate planes, but the plane is x + y =1, which is a vertical plane. So the solid lies between x=0, y=0, the plane x + y=1, and the paraboloid. But since the paraboloid is above z=1, and the coordinate planes include z=0, maybe the solid is between z=0 and the paraboloid, but limited by x + y ≤1.

Wait, that might make sense. So z goes from 0 up to the paraboloid, and x and y are bounded by x + y ≤1, x ≥0, y ≥0.

So the volume would be the integral over x, y, z, with z from 0 to 2x² + y² +1, and x and y in the region defined by x ≥0, y ≥0, x + y ≤1.

Wait, but if z starts at 0, then the lower limit is 0 and the upper is the paraboloid. So the integral becomes:

V = ∫∫∫ dz dy dx, with z from 0 to 2x² + y² +1, y from 0 to1 -x, and x from 0 to1.

So setting up the integral:

V = ∫ (x=0 to1) ∫ (y=0 to1 -x) [∫ (z=0 to 2x² + y² +1) dz] dy dx.

Computing the inner integral first: ∫ dz from 0 to 2x² + y² +1 is just (2x² + y² +1) - 0 = 2x² + y² +1.

So now V = ∫ (x=0 to1) ∫ (y=0 to1 -x) (2x² + y² +1) dy dx.

Now I need to compute this double integral.

Let's first integrate with respect to y:

For a fixed x, the integral over y is:

∫ (y=0 to1 -x) [2x² + y² +1] dy.

We can split this into three separate integrals:

2x² ∫ dy from 0 to1 -x = 2x²*(1 -x -0) = 2x²(1 -x).

∫ y² dy from 0 to1 -x = [ (y^3)/3 ] from 0 to1 -x = ( (1 -x)^3 ) /3.

∫ 1 dy from 0 to1 -x = (1 -x -0) = (1 -x).

So adding them together:

2x²(1 -x) + (1 -x)^3 /3 + (1 -x).

Now factor out (1 -x):

(1 -x) [2x² + ( (1 -x)^2 )/3 +1 ].

Wait, let me compute each term:

Let me compute each part:

Term1: 2x²(1 -x) = 2x² - 2x^3.

Term2: (1 -x)^3 /3.

Term3: (1 -x).

So combining all terms:

Term1 + Term2 + Term3 = (2x² - 2x^3) + (1 -3x +3x² -x^3)/3 + (1 -x).

Let me expand each term:

Term1: 2x² - 2x^3.

Term2: (1 -3x +3x² -x^3)/3 = (1/3) - x + x² - (x^3)/3.

Term3: 1 -x.

Now add all terms together:

Let's collect like terms.

Constants: (1/3) +1 = 4/3.

x terms: (-x) + (-x) = -2x.

x² terms: (x²) +2x² =3x².

x^3 terms: (-2x^3) + (-x^3/3) = (-6x^3/3 -x^3/3) = (-7
