Question:

A graduate student’s dissertation chair, Dr. X, turns out to be of little help, and the student ends up obtaining advice and assistance from an associate professor, Dr. Z. Dr. X does review the dissertation when it is completed and she is listed as the dissertation chair. Several months later, the student decides to write an article for a professional journal that is based his dissertation research. In terms of publication credit:

Options:

A: Dr. Z should not be listed as an author since she is not the student's official dissertation chair.
B: Dr. Y and Dr. Z should be listed as co-authors.
C: Dr. X should be listed as second author since she was the student’s official dissertation chair.
D: The student should be the sole author as the research is based on his dissertation.
E: Dr. X should be listed as first author since she was the student’s official dissertation chair.
F: Dr. Z should be listed as first author if her contribution was substantial.
G: Dr. X and Dr. Z should be listed as co-authors with no particular order.
H: Dr. Z should be listed as second author if her contribution warrants it.
I: Dr. X should be listed as second author and Dr. Z should not be included as an author.
J: Dr. Z should be listed as first author, and the student should be listed as second author.

Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the situation is about a graduate student whose dissertation chair, Dr. X, wasn't very helpful. Instead, the student got most of their advice and help from Dr. Z, an associate professor. Dr. X did review the completed dissertation and is listed as the chair. Now, the student wants to write an article based on their dissertation research and is deciding about publication credit.

I need to figure out the correct authorship here. Remember, authorship in academic publications is based on contributions, not just titles. So, the key is who contributed significantly to the work.

Let's go through the options one by one.

Option A says Dr. Z shouldn't be an author because she's not the official chair. But I remember that authorship depends on contribution, not title. So if Dr. Z helped a lot, she should be included. So A is probably wrong.

Option B mentions Dr. Y and Dr. Z as co-authors, but wait, the question doesn't mention a Dr. Y. That's confusing. Maybe a typo? The question only talks about Dr. X and Dr. Z. So B might be incorrect because Dr. Y isn't part of the scenario.

Option C suggests Dr. X as second author because she's the chair. But if Dr. X didn't contribute much except reviewing, maybe she shouldn't be an author at all. Chairs often aren't authors unless they contribute. So C might not be right.

Option D says the student should be the sole author. That could be the case if the student did all the work and Dr. Z's help wasn't significant enough for authorship. But the question says Dr. Z provided advice and assistance, which sounds substantial. So D might not be correct.

Option E suggests Dr. X as first author because she's the chair. That doesn't seem right. Being the chair doesn't automatically make someone the first author; it's about the work done. So E is probably wrong.

Option F says Dr. Z should be first author if her contribution was substantial. Wait, but the student is the one who did the research. Typically, the student would be first author, and the contributing professor second. So F might not be correct unless Dr. Z did the majority of the work, which doesn't seem to be the case here.

Option G suggests Dr. X and Dr. Z as co-authors with no order. But again, if Dr. X didn't contribute much beyond reviewing, she might not deserve co-authorship. So G might not be right.

Option H says Dr. Z should be second author if she contributed. That makes sense. The student is first, and Dr. Z is second. So H seems plausible.

Option I states Dr. X as second author and excludes Dr. Z. But if Dr. Z helped more, that's not fair. So I is probably wrong.

Option J suggests Dr. Z as first and the student as second. That would mean Dr. Z did more work, which might not be the case here. The student is the main researcher, so J doesn't seem right.

So putting it all together, the correct approach is that the student is the primary author, and if Dr. Z contributed significantly, she should be listed as second author. That points to option H.

The correct answer is based on the principle that authorship in academic publications should reflect the contributions to the work. The graduate student conducted the research and wrote the dissertation, making them the primary author. Dr. Z provided substantial advice and assistance, warranting her inclusion as the second author. Dr. X, as the dissertation chair, reviewed the work but did not contribute sufficiently to justify authorship. Therefore, the appropriate authorship is the student as first author and Dr. Z as second author if her contribution warrants it.

Answer: H
