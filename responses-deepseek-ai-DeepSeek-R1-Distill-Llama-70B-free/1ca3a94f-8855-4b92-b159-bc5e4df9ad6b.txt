Okay, so I have this question about indicators of emotion, and I need to choose the right option from A to J. Let me think through this.

The question is asking for three indicators of emotion. Emotions are feelings like happiness, sadness, anger, etc. But indicators would be how we can tell someone is experiencing an emotion. So, I remember that emotions can be measured in different ways.

First, I think about what indicators mean. They are signs or ways to detect something. So for emotions, these could be physical signs, what someone says, or maybe how they behave. 

Option G says personal reports, observed behaviors, and physiological indicators. Personal reports would be like when someone tells you how they feel. Observed behaviors could be body language or facial expressions. Physiological indicators are like heart rate, sweating, or other body changes. That makes sense because these are three different methods to assess emotions.

Looking at other options, A is mood swings, depression, anxiety. Those are more like mental health issues or states, not indicators. B is about social media and such, which doesn't directly relate to emotions. C is cognitive stuff like intelligence, which isn't about emotions. D is speech-related, which could be part of observed behavior but only covers one aspect. E lists emotions themselves, not indicators. F is about external conditions, not indicators. H and I are physical traits unrelated to emotions. J is about preferences, which might reflect emotions but aren't direct indicators.

So option G seems to cover the three main ways: self-reporting, observing behavior, and physical changes. That fits what I know about how psychologists measure emotions.
