Question:

When one uses a time-series design to evaluate a program, fluctuation in the outcome slope can be accounted for by various alternative hypotheses. According to Campbell and Stanley, the most probable alternative is that

Options:

A: the outcome measure was not sensitive enough
B: a simultaneous event produced the fluctuation
C: the participants did not understand the program
D: the data was not analyzed correctly
E: the program was not implemented correctly
F: the fluctuation was due to random chance
G: participants dropped out of the group, reducing the size of the sample
H: aging effects were unduly influential
I: test—retest reliability is inadequate
J: the time-series design was flawed

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about time-series designs in program evaluation. Hmm. I remember that time-series designs involve taking multiple measurements over time before and after an intervention to see if there's a change in the outcome. But the question is about what Campbell and Stanley say regarding the most probable alternative hypothesis when there are fluctuations in the outcome slope.

Wait, alternative hypotheses in this context are other explanations for the observed changes besides the program's effect. So, when the outcome measure's slope changes, what else could be causing it?

I think about the possible options. The options are A through J. Let me try to recall Campbell and Stanley's work. They discussed various threats to validity, both internal and external. For time-series designs, one of the issues is that other events could occur at the same time as the intervention.

Option B says a simultaneous event caused the fluctuation. That makes sense because in a time-series, without a control group, it's hard to rule out other events happening around the same time. Like, maybe something else happened in the community or organization that affected the outcome measure.

Other options: Option A suggests the measure wasn't sensitive. That's a possibility, but I don't think it's the most probable as per Campbell. Option C is about participants not understanding the program—maybe, but not the main alternative hypothesis. D is data analysis issues, which is more of a methodological flaw than an alternative explanation. E is about incorrect implementation, which is more about the program's effectiveness rather than explaining the slope change. F is random chance, which is possible but maybe less likely as the most probable. G is about sample size due to dropouts. H is aging effects, which might affect trends but not necessarily the slope changes after the intervention. I is test-retest reliability, which would affect measurement consistency. J says the design itself was flawed.

Wait, but the question is about the most probable alternative hypothesis. Campbell and Stanley, if I remember correctly, often emphasized that without a control group, you can't rule out other events. So when you see a change, it could be due to some other event happening at the same time as the program. That points to option B.

So the answer should be B.

The question asks about the most probable alternative hypothesis, according to Campbell and Stanley, when evaluating a program using a time-series design and observing fluctuations in the outcome slope. Time-series designs measure outcomes multiple times before and after an intervention, but without a control group, it is challenging to rule out other explanations for observed changes.

Among the options provided, the most plausible explanation is that a simultaneous event caused the fluctuation. Campbell and Stanley emphasize that without a control group, other events occurring at the same time as the intervention could influence the outcome, making this the most probable alternative hypothesis.

Answer: B
