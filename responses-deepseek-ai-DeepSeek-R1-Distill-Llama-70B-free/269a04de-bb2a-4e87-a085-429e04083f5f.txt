Question:

A defendant and his college roommate went home together for the holiday vacation. The defendant was to go back to college by himself. The day that the defendant was to drive back to college, his roommate asked him if he would deliver a package to one of their classmates. The defendant agreed, and the roommate gave him a small package, which the defendant placed in his glove compartment. While driving back to school, the defendant was stopped for speeding. When the state trooper asked the defendant for his license and registration, he reached into the glove compartment. As he did, the package that his roommate had given him fell onto the floor. When it hit the floor, the box broke open and a plastic envelope containing a white substance slid out. Seeing that the substance appeared to be cocaine, the state trooper arrested the defendant for possession of illegal narcotics under a state statute making it a felony to willfully possess a controlled substance. The package did, in fact, contain cocaine. If the defendant is later brought to trial for this charge, his best defense is that

Options:

A: the package didn't belong to him.
B: the cocaine was illegally seized.
C: the trooper didn't have a search warrant.
D: the defendant didn't know what was in the package.
E: the roommate didn't tell him he was carrying illegal narcotics.
F: the roommate should be the one charged, not him.
G: the substance was not tested to confirm it was cocaine.
H: the defendant didn't willingly possess the substance.
I: the cocaine was not in a recognizable form.
J: the defendant was not speeding.

Okay, so I've got this law question to tackle, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The scenario is about a defendant who took a package from his roommate to deliver to a classmate. He put it in his glove compartment. Then, while driving back, he was stopped for speeding. When he reached for his license and registration, the package fell out, broke open, revealing a plastic envelope with a white substance that looked like cocaine. He was arrested for possession.

The question is about the defendant's best defense if he's brought to trial. The options are A through J.

First, I need to understand the legal issue here. The charge is possession of a controlled substance, specifically cocaine, which is a felony under the state statute. The key here is whether the defendant "willfully" possessed it.

I remember that possession can be actual or constructive. Actual possession means the person knowingly has control over the substance. Constructive possession is when the person has control over the place where the substance is found and knows it's there.

So the defendant's best defense would probably center around whether he knowingly possessed the cocaine. If he didn't know what was in the package, he might not have willfully possessed it.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The package didn't belong to him. Well, ownership isn't the only factor. Possession can be temporary, like holding something for someone else.

Option B: The cocaine was illegally seized. But when the officer stopped him for speeding, which is a valid reason, and the package fell out during a lawful search for license and registration, it might be considered in plain view. So maybe the seizure was legal, making this not a good defense.

Option C: No search warrant. Same as B, if the officer was legally allowed to look where he did, no warrant was needed. So this might not hold.

Option D: The defendant didn't know what was in the package. This seems relevant because if he didn't know, he can't have knowingly possessed the cocaine.

Option E: The roommate didn't tell him it was illegal. But if he knew it was something illegal, that might matter, but if he didn't know what it was at all, then this might tie into D.

Option F: The roommate should be charged. That's more about who is guilty, but the defendant is the one in possession, so this doesn't directly help his defense.

Option G: The substance wasn't tested. Well, if it's tested and proven to be cocaine, this isn't helpful. But the question says it did contain cocaine, so this is moot.

Option H: The defendant didn't willingly possess. This seems similar to D. Willingly possessing would require knowledge.

Option I: Not in recognizable form. Maybe if it wasn't identifiable, but the officer thought it was cocaine, but again, the question says it was, so this might not help.

Option J: He wasn't speeding. The stop was for speeding, but if he was speeding, the stop is valid. If he wasn't, maybe the stop was unlawful, but that's more about the initial seizure. But the question says he was stopped for speeding, so maybe the stop was valid. Plus, even if the stop was invalid, the package being in plain view might still allow the evidence.

So the main issue is whether the defendant knew the package contained cocaine. If he didn't, he can argue he didn't willfully possess it. So the best defense would be that he didn't know what was in the package.

Looking back at the options, D says the defendant didn't know what was in the package. H says he didn't willingly possess. These seem similar, but H is more about the intent, while D is about knowledge. The statute requires willful possession, which implies intentional possession, so knowledge is key.

Therefore, the best defense is D, but wait, let me make sure.

Wait, another thought: Some jurisdictions might require that the defendant knew the substance was illegal. So if he didn't know it was cocaine, he couldn't have willfully possessed a controlled substance.

So D seems like the right choice because it directly addresses the knowledge element required for the crime.

The defendant's best defense is that he lacked knowledge of the package's contents, which is essential for proving willful possession under the statute. 

Answer: D
