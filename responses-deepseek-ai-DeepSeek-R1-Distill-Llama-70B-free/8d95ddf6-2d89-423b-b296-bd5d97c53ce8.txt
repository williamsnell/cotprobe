Okay, I have this question about the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by recalling what I know about this topic. From what I remember, unemployment insurance is a joint state-federal program. The Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) plays a role in funding this system.

Let me break down each option to see which one is correct.

Option A: "The unemployment insurance system is administered by the states through their employment laws." I think this is true because I remember that each state handles the actual administration, even though FUTA is a federal law. So states manage the day-to-day operations, set some rules, and handle the claims.

Option B: "The Act is intended to provide financial assistance to unemployed workers who have been laid off due to seasonal changes in demand." I'm not too sure about this. I think unemployment benefits are for people who lose their jobs through no fault of their own, like layoffs. But seasonal changes might be a specific case. I'll have to think about whether FUTA specifically targets seasonal workers. I don't recall FUTA being limited to seasonal changes; it's more general.

Option C: "An employee who resigns regardless of cause is eligible for unemployment benefits." I believe that if you quit your job voluntarily, you're usually not eligible for benefits. Unless it's for a good cause, like health reasons or harassment, but the option says "regardless of cause," so I think this option is incorrect.

Option D: "An employee who is fired for cause is eligible for unemployment benefits." If you're fired for cause, like misconduct, you typically aren't eligible. So this option is probably wrong.

Option E: "The Act is intended to assist workers who are permanently out of work and need assistance in supporting themselves." Wait, unemployment insurance is usually for temporary support while looking for new jobs, not necessarily for permanent situations. So maybe this is incorrect.

Option F: "The Act mandates that employers provide health insurance to employees who are unemployed." No, that's not right. FUTA is about unemployment taxes, not health insurance. COBRA deals with health insurance continuation, but that's a different law.

Option G: "The federal unemployment system is funded solely by employee taxes." No, I think it's funded by both employers and employees, but wait, FUTA specifically taxes employers, and states might have their own taxes. So this option might be incorrect because it says solely by employees.

Option H: "The federal unemployment system is funded by both employer and employee taxes." Wait, FUTA is a federal tax on employers, and states collect their own taxes from employers as well, but do employees contribute? I think in some states, employees pay a small portion. So H could be correct, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe FUTA is only on employers.

Option I: "The Act also covers compensation for self-employed individuals." I don't think so. Unemployment typically applies to employees, not the self-employed. So this is probably wrong.

Option J: "The Act is enforced by the Federal Labor Relations Authority." I don't think that's right. The Federal Labor Relations Authority deals with labor relations in the federal government, not unemployment. The Department of Labor would handle FUTA enforcement, perhaps.

Now, going back to the options. The question is which statement is correct.

Option A says the system is administered by the states. That sounds right because states run their own unemployment programs with federal guidelines. So A is correct.

Option B talks about seasonal changes. I'm not sure, but I think FUTA isn't specifically for seasonal workers. It's broader.

Option H: If the federal system is funded by both, then maybe. Wait, FUTA is a tax on employers, and each state has its own unemployment tax, also on employers. But some states may have employee contributions. So maybe the federal part is only employer-funded, but overall, the system includes both. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

But the question is about the Federal Unemployment Tax Act itself. FUTA imposes a tax on employers, so the federal part is funded solely by employers. So option G says it's funded solely by employee taxes, which is wrong. Option H says both, which might be incorrect because FUTA is only on employers. Wait, but the overall system might include state taxes, which sometimes have employer and employee parts. So perhaps H is incorrect in the context of FUTA specifically. The question is about the Act itself, FUTA.

So the correct answer would relate to the administration being state-run, so Option A.

Wait, but the question is which statement is correct regarding FUTA. So for the options:

A is correct because FUTA sets up the framework, but the administration is by the states.

Yes, that's right. So the correct answer should be A.

The Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) is a federal law that works in conjunction with state-run unemployment insurance programs. Each state administers its own program, adhering to federal guidelines set by FUTA. This means that while FUTA provides the framework and funding mechanism, the day-to-day administration, such as processing claims and disbursing benefits, is handled at the state level.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Correct. The unemployment insurance system is administered by the states through their employment laws, as FUTA establishes the federal framework but leaves administration to state governments.
- **B**: Incorrect. FUTA is not specifically aimed at workers laid off due to seasonal changes; it is a broader program for workers unemployed through no fault of their own.
- **C**: Incorrect. Employees who resign voluntarily, regardless of cause, are generally ineligible for unemployment benefits unless there is a justifiable reason.
- **D**: Incorrect. Employees fired for cause, such as misconduct, are typically ineligible for unemployment benefits.
- **E**: Incorrect. Unemployment insurance is intended for temporary support while workers seek new employment, not for permanent unemployment.
- **F**: Incorrect. FUTA does not mandate employers to provide health insurance to unemployed employees; it focuses on unemployment taxes.
- **G**: Incorrect. The federal unemployment system is funded by employer taxes under FUTA, not solely by employee taxes.
- **H**: Incorrect in the context of FUTA. While some states may impose taxes on both employers and employees, FUTA itself is funded solely by employer taxes.
- **I**: Incorrect. FUTA does not cover compensation for self-employed individuals, as unemployment benefits are typically for employees.
- **J**: Incorrect. The Federal Labor Relations Authority is unrelated to FUTA enforcement; the Department of Labor oversees FUTA.

The correct answer is **A**, as it accurately reflects the role of state administration within the federal framework established by FUTA.
