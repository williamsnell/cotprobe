Question:

In a certain country, a person must be at least 16 years old to drive a car and must be at least 18 years old to vote. The variable age represents the age of a person as an integer. Which of the following expressions evaluates to true if the person is old enough to drive but not old enough to vote, and evaluates to false otherwise?
 I. (age ≥ 16) AND (age ≤ 18)
 II. (age ≥ 16) AND (NOT(age ≥ 18))
 III. (age < 18) AND (NOT(age < 16))

Options:

A: II only
B: I and II only
C: I and III only
D: II and III only

Okay, so I have this logic problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see. The question is about determining the correct logical expression that evaluates to true only when a person is old enough to drive but not old enough to vote. 

From the problem, I know that driving requires a person to be at least 16, so age >=16. Voting requires being at least 18, so age >=18. So, the condition we're looking for is when the person is 16 or older but younger than 18. 

The expressions given are I, II, III, and I need to evaluate each to see which ones meet the condition.

Let's look at each expression one by one.

Expression I is (age >=16) AND (age <=18). Hmm, wait a minute. If someone is 17, they are allowed to drive but can't vote. So that's good. But what about someone who is exactly 18? Then age >=16 is true, and age <=18 is also true. So this expression would evaluate to true for age 18. But according to the problem, the person should not be old enough to vote, which means age <18. So expression I would incorrectly include 18-year-olds, who can vote. So expression I isn't correct because it includes 18.

Expression II is (age >=16) AND (NOT(age >=18)). Let me break this down. The first part is age >=16, which is correct for driving. The second part is NOT(age >=18), which simplifies to age <18. So overall, this is age >=16 and age <18. That's exactly the condition we want: 16, 17, but not 18. So expression II should evaluate correctly. For example, age 16: 16>=16 is true, and 16>=18 is false, so NOT is true. So true. Age 17: same as 16. Age 18: 18>=16 is true, but 18>=18 is true, so NOT is false. So overall, false. That's correct.

Now expression III is (age <18) AND (NOT(age <16)). Let's see. The first part is age <18. The second part is NOT(age <16), which is age >=16. So the entire expression becomes age >=16 AND age <18. Which is the same as expression II. So expression III is also correct. Wait, because age <18 and >=16 is the same as 16<=age<18, which is exactly the condition we're looking for.

So both II and III evaluate to true when the person is between 16 and 17 inclusive. Now, the question is which of the options is correct. The options are:

A: II only
B: I and II only
C: I and III only
D: II and III only

Wait, but earlier I thought expression I was incorrect because it includes 18. So the correct expressions are II and III. So the correct option should be D: II and III only.

Wait, am I sure about expression III? Let me reevaluate. Expression III is (age <18) AND (NOT(age <16)). So NOT(age <16) is the same as age >=16. So the expression is age <18 AND age >=16, which is the same as 16 <= age <18. That's correct. So yes, both II and III are correct.

So the correct answer should be option D: II and III only.

The question requires determining which logical expressions evaluate to true only when a person is old enough to drive (age ≥ 16) but not old enough to vote (age < 18). Let’s analyze each expression:

1. **Expression I: (age ≥ 16) AND (age ≤ 18)**  
   This expression includes ages 16 and 17, which is correct for driving, but it also includes age 18, where the person can vote. Since the condition requires the person to be unable to vote, this expression is incorrect.

2. **Expression II: (age ≥ 16) AND (NOT(age ≥ 18))**  
   Breaking it down:  
   - (age ≥ 16) ensures the person can drive.  
   - (NOT(age ≥ 18)) simplifies to (age < 18), ensuring the person cannot vote.  
   Together, this expression correctly evaluates to true for ages 16 and 17, and false otherwise. This is correct.

3. **Expression III: (age < 18) AND (NOT(age < 16))**  
   Breaking it down:  
   - (age < 18) ensures the person cannot vote.  
   - (NOT(age < 16)) simplifies to (age ≥ 16), ensuring the person can drive.  
   Together, this expression also correctly evaluates to true for ages 16 and 17, and false otherwise. This is correct.

### Conclusion:  
Both expressions II and III are correct, as they accurately represent the condition of being old enough to drive but not old enough to vote. Expression I is incorrect because it includes age 18. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D: II and III only**
