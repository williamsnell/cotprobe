Okay, so I've got this question here about depreciation using the straight-line method. Hmm, I remember depreciation is about spreading the cost of an asset over its useful life. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me think.

The question says Amazing Realty bought an office building for $13,000,000. The building is expected to last 20 years and have a salvage value of $1,000,000. I need to find the annual depreciation allowance using the straight-line method.

Wait, straight-line depreciation means the same amount is deducted each year, right? So the formula must be (Cost - Salvage Value) divided by Useful Life. Oh right, because you don't depreciate the salvage value part; that's what's left at the end.

So plugging in the numbers: Cost is $13,000,000, Salvage is $1,000,000. Subtracting those gives $12,000,000. Then divide by 20 years. Let me do that math. 12 million divided by 20... 12 divided by 20 is 0.6, so 0.6 million. Oh wait, that's $600,000 a year.

Let me double-check. The asset cost is 13 mil, but it's not going to zero, just down to 1 mil. So each year, the depreciation is the same. So yes, (13,000,000 - 1,000,000) / 20 = 12,000,000 /20 = 600,000 per year.

Looking at the options, option I is $600,000. So the answer should be I.

The annual depreciation allowance using the straight-line method is calculated by subtracting the salvage value from the cost of the asset and dividing by the useful life. 

\[
\text{Annual Depreciation} = \frac{\text{Cost} - \text{Salvage Value}}{\text{Useful Life}} = \frac{13,000,000 - 1,000,000}{20} = \frac{12,000,000}{20} = 600,000
\]

Thus, the correct answer is **I: $600,000**.
