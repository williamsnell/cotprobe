Okay, so I'm trying to solve this He-Ne laser problem. Hmm, I remember He-Ne lasers are pretty common, often red, and have a specific wavelength. The question has two parts, a and b. Let's tackle them one by one.

Starting with part (a): How many photons are emitted per second?

Alright, the given parameters are:
- Line width: 10^3 Hz. Wait, line width usually relates to the range of frequencies the laser emits. But I think for calculating the number of photons per second, the key factors are power and energy per photon.
- Operating wavelength is 6328 Angstroms. Oh right, 1 Angstrom is 1e-10 meters, so 6328 Angstroms is 6328e-10 m, which is 6.328e-7 meters.
- Power is 1 milliwatt. Milli is 1e-3, so that's 1e-3 W, which is 1e-3 joules per second.

So, photons per second would be the total power divided by the energy per photon. Energy per photon is given by E = hc/lambda.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, calculate the energy per photon:
h is Planck's constant, approximately 6.626e-34 J·s.
c is speed of light, about 3e8 m/s.
lambda is 6328e-10 m.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / (6328e-10)

Wait, let me compute that numerator first: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Then divide by lambda (6328e-10 m):
E = 1.9878e-25 / 6328e-10 = Let's see, 6328e-10 is 6.328e-7 m.

So E = 1.9878e-25 / 6.328e-7 = approximately 3.14e-19 J per photon.

Wait, let me do that division more accurately. 1.9878e-25 divided by 6.328e-7:

1.9878e-25 / 6.328e-7 = (1.9878 / 6.328) * 1e-18.

1.9878 /6.328 is about 0.314. So 0.314e-18 J, which is 3.14e-19 J per photon.

Now, the power is 1e-3 W, which is 1e-3 J/s. So the number of photons per second is power divided by energy per photon.

n = (1e-3 J/s) / (3.14e-19 J/photon) = approx 3.18e15 photons/s.

Looking at the options, I see several in the 3.0e15 to 3.2e15 range. Let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate more accurately. Let me redo E.

E = hc/λ.

h=6.62607015e-34 J·s (exact value, but using approximate is fine here).
c=2.99792e8 m/s, but approx 3e8 is okay for this.
λ=6328 Å = 6328e-10 m = 6.328e-7 m.

So E = (6.626e-34 * 2.99792e8) / 6.328e-7.

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Wait, more accurately: 6.626e-34 * 2.99792e8 = let's compute:

6.626 * 2.99792 ≈ 19.86 (since 6*3=18, 0.626*3=1.878, but precise would be 6.626 *3=19.878, but 2.99792 is just under 3. So 6.626 *2.99792 = approx 19.86).

So 19.86e-26 J·m? Wait, 1e-34 * 1e8 = 1e-26, so 19.86e-26 J·m = 1.986e-25 J·m.

Divide by λ=6.328e-7 m:

E = 1.986e-25 / 6.328e-7 = (1.986 / 6.328) * 1e-18.

1.986 /6.328 is approximately 0.3137.

So E≈3.137e-19 J per photon.

Power P=1e-3 W = 1e-3 J/s.

Number of photons per second n = P / E = (1e-3) / (3.137e-19) = approx 3.19e15 photons/s.

Looking at the options, option B is 3.2e15 for part (a). Option G is 3.2e15 for part (a) as well. So both B and G have 3.2e15 for part (a). Wait, let me check the options:

Looking at the options:

A: 3.5e15, 6.2e9
B:3.2e15,6.0e9
C:5.0e15...
D:1.6e15...
E:2.8e15...
F:2.5e15...
G:3.2e15,5.9...
H:3.0e15...
I:4.5e15...
J:4.5e15...

So for part (a), the value is around 3.19e15, which is closest to 3.2e15. So both B and G have 3.2e15 for part (a).

Hmm, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations. Let me try a different approach.

Alternatively, using the relation n= P*lambda/(hc). Since n is the number of photons per second.

P is in watts, which is joules per second.

n = (P * lambda) / (h c)

Wait, this might be a better way.

So n = (1e-3 J/s) * (6328e-10 m) / (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s )

Compute denominator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

So n = (1e-3 * 6328e-10) / 1.9878e-25

Compute numerator: 1e-3 * 6328e-10 = 6.328e-13.

So n = 6.328e-13 /1.9878e-25 = approx 3.18e12? Wait wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait:

Wait, 6.328e-13 divided by 1.9878e-25 is (6.328 /1.9878 ) * 1e( -13 +25 )= (approx 3.18) *1e12 = 3.18e12. Wait, that's way off from our earlier 3e15.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. I must have messed up the exponents.

Wait, no, let me recompute the numerator and denominator correctly.

Denominator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 6.626 *3 = 19.878e-34+8 = 19.878e-26 = 1.9878e-25.

Numerator: P * lambda = 1e-3 W * 6328e-10 m.

Wait, W is J/s, so 1e-3 J/s * 6328e-10 m. But wait, m isn't in the units, so perhaps I should think in terms of dimensional analysis.

Wait, actually, n = P * lambda / (h c). Let me plug in the values correctly.

n = (1e-3 J/s) * (6328e-10 m) / (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s )

Let me compute the numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 1e-3 *6328e-10 = 6328e-13 = 6.328e-10 (because 1e-3 *1e-10 = 1e-13, and 6328e-13 is 6.328e-10).

Denominator: 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25.

So n = (6.328e-10) / (1.9878e-25) = (6.328 /1.9878) * 1e( -10 +25 ) = approx 3.18 *1e15 = 3.18e15 photons/s.

Ah, so same as before, around 3.18e15.

So part (a)'s answer is about 3.2e15, which matches options B and G. So part (a) is 3.2e15.

Now, part (b): If the output beam is 1 mm in diameter, at what temperature would a blackbody have to be in order to emit the same number of photons from an equal area and over the same frequency interval as the laser?

Hmm, okay. So the blackbody emits the same number of photons per second as the laser. The conditions are same area (so the beam area is 1 mm diameter, so radius 0.5 mm, area is π*(0.5e-3 m)^2 ), and same frequency interval (which for the laser is the line width of 1e3 Hz).

Wait, but blackbody radiation's photon emission depends on temperature and the frequency range. So we need to calculate the temperature where the blackbody emits n_photons = 3.2e15 photons per second, considering the same area and same frequency interval, which is 1e3 Hz.

Wait, but how do we model this?

I remember that the number of photons emitted by a blackbody per unit area per unit time per unit frequency is given by the Planck distribution.

But perhaps it's easier to use the formula for the number of photons emitted by a blackbody radiator:

n = (8 π c / (λ^5)) * (1/(e^{h c/(λ k T)} -1 )) ) * Δλ * A * t

Wait, but in our case, the frequency interval is given, not the wavelength interval. Hmm, maybe better to use frequency in the Planck equation.

Alternatively, the number of photons emitted per second (n) from a blackbody at temperature T, over a frequency range Δν, from an area A, is given by:

n = (A) * (Δν) * (8 π ν² / (c²)) ) * (1/(e^{h ν/(k T)} -1 )) ) * dt? Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up some terms.

Wait, the spectral radiance (in terms of frequency) is given by Bν(T) = (2 h ν^3 / c^2) / (e^{h ν/(k T)} -1 ) ). And the number of photons would be the integral over frequency of Bν multiplied by A and the frequency interval.

Wait, perhaps we can model it as:

n = A * Δν * (8 π ν² / c²) * (1/(e^{h ν/(k T)} -1 )) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think differently.

The Planck distribution in terms of frequency is:

Bν(T) = (2 h ν^3)/(c^2) * 1/(e^{h ν/(k T)} - 1 )

The number of photons emitted per unit area, per unit time, per unit frequency is Bν(T) multiplied by (8 π)/(c^2) * ν^2, perhaps? Wait, no, I think I'm confusing some terms.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the number of photons emitted per second as:

n = A * Δν * (8 π ν^2 / c^2) * (1/(e^{h ν/(k T)} -1 )) * (1/ (h ν)) )

Because the energy per photon is h ν, and the number of photons would be (energy density) / (energy per photon).

Wait, energy density in blackbody radiation is given by u(ν, T) = (8 π h ν^3)/(c^3) * 1/(e^{h ν/(k T)} -1 )

So the energy per unit volume per unit frequency is u. Then, the power emitted (energy per unit time) from an area A would involve integrating u over volume? Hmm, perhaps it's better to use the Stefan-Boltzmann law, but that's for the total radiation, not a specific frequency.

Alternatively, the number of photons emitted per second is:

n = (A) * (Δν) * (8 π ν^2 / c^2) * (1/(e^{h ν/(k T)} -1 )) ) * (1/(h ν)) )

Because:

- A is the area.

- Δν is the frequency interval.

- The term (8 π ν^2 / c^2) comes from the density of states in frequency space.

- The term (1/(e^{h ν/(k T)} -1 )) is from the Bose-Einstein distribution.

- And 1/(h ν) converts energy to photon count.

Wait, perhaps that's correct. So putting it all together:

n = (A * Δν) * (8 π ν^2 / c^2) * (1/(e^{h ν/(k T)} -1 )) * (1/(h ν)) )

Simplify this expression:

n = (A * Δν * 8 π ν^2 ) / (c^2 (e^{h ν/(k T)} -1 ) h ν )

Simplify ν terms: ν^2 / ν = ν.

So n = (A * Δν * 8 π ν ) / (c^2 h (e^{h ν/(k T)} -1 ) )

Now, in this problem, the laser's frequency ν is given by c / lambda. The wavelength is 6328 Å, so lambda = 6328e-10 m.

So ν = c / lambda = (3e8 m/s) / (6328e-10 m) = 3e8 / 6.328e-7 = approx 4.74e14 Hz.

Wait, let me compute that accurately.

3e8 divided by 6328e-10:

6328e-10 is 6.328e-7 m.

3e8 / 6.328e-7 = (3 /6.328 ) * 1e15 = approx 0.474 *1e15 = 4.74e14 Hz.

So ν ≈4.74e14 Hz.

So the frequency is about 4.74e14 Hz.

The area A is the beam area, which is a circle with diameter 1 mm. Radius is 0.5 mm = 0.5e-3 m.

Area A = π r² = π (0.5e-3)^2 = π * 0.25e-6 = approx 7.85e-7 m².

Δν is the line width, which is 1e3 Hz.

Now, plug all into the equation for n:

n = (A * Δν * 8 π ν ) / (c² h (e^{h ν/(k T)} -1 ) )

But wait, we know that the laser emits n =3.2e15 photons per second. We need to set this equal to the blackbody's emission and solve for T.

So,

3.2e15 = (A * Δν * 8 π ν ) / (c² h (e^{x} -1 ) )

where x = h ν/(k T)

We can rearrange to solve for x:

e^{x} -1 = (A * Δν * 8 π ν ) / (c² h n )

Wait, let me clarify:

3.2e15 = [ (7.85e-7 m²) * (1e3 Hz) * 8 π *4.74e14 Hz ) ] / [ (c²) * h * (e^{x} -1) ) ]

Wait, let me plug in all the values step by step.

Compute numerator: A * Δν *8 π ν

A ≈7.85e-7 m²

Δν=1e3 Hz

8 π ≈25.1327

ν≈4.74e14 Hz

So numerator =7.85e-7 *1e3 *25.1327 *4.74e14

Compute that:

7.85e-7 *1e3 =7.85e-4

7.85e-4 *25.1327 ≈ 0.01972 (because 7.85e-4 *25 ≈0.019625)

0.01972 *4.74e14 ≈0.01972 *4.74e14 = approx 9.36e12.

So numerator ≈9.36e12.

Denominator: c² h (e^x -1 )

c=3e8 m/s, so c²=9e16 m²/s².

h=6.626e-34 J·s.

So denominator term without (e^x -1 ) is 9e16 *6.626e-34 =9e16 *6.626e-34 = (9*6.626) *1e(16-34) = 59.634 *1e-18 =5.9634e-17.

So denominator is 5.9634e-17 * (e^x -1 )

Putting it all together:

3.2e15 = (9.36e12) / (5.9634e-17 (e^x -1) )

Rearranging:

e^x -1 = (9.36e12) / (3.2e15 *5.9634e-17 )

Compute denominator:3.2e15 *5.9634e-17 = (3.2 *5.9634) *1e(15-17) = approx 19.07 *1e-2 = 0.1907.

So e^x -1 =9.36e12 / 0.1907 ≈4.91e13.

So e^x ≈4.91e13 +1 ≈4.91e13.

Take natural log of both sides:

x = ln(4.91e
