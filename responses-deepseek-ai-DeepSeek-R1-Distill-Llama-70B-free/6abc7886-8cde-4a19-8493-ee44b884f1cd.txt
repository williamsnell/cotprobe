Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a racing car passing a grandstand. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

Alright, the problem says the car is moving at 50 ft/sec when it passes one end of the grandstand. Then it slows down with a constant acceleration, and when it passes the other end, it's moving at 10 ft/sec. The whole process takes 20 seconds. I need to find the acceleration (a with a dot over it, which I think means it's deceleration here) and the length of the grandstand.

Hmm, I remember in kinematics, when you have constant acceleration, there are a few equations you can use. Let me jot down the given values:

Initial velocity, u = 50 ft/s
Final velocity, v = 10 ft/s
Time, t = 20 s
Acceleration, a = ? (it's negative because it's slowing down)
Distance, s = ? (length of the grandstand)

I think the first equation I should use is the one that relates velocity, acceleration, and time. The equation is v = u + a*t. That should let me find the acceleration.

Plugging in the numbers:
10 = 50 + a*20
Subtract 50 from both sides:
10 -50 = a*20
-40 = 20a
Divide both sides by 20:
a = -2 ft/s²

So the acceleration is -2 ft/s². Okay, that's part (a) done.

Now for part (b), finding the length of the grandstand. I think I can use the equation that gives the distance traveled under constant acceleration. The equation is s = ut + (1/2) a t².

Let me plug in the numbers I have:
u =50, t=20, a=-2.

s = 50*20 + 0.5*(-2)*(20)^2

Calculating each term:
50*20 = 1000
0.5*(-2) = -1
20^2=400, so -1*400 = -400

So s = 1000 - 400 = 600 ft.

Wait, but wait a minute. I should double-check because I had an initial velocity and final velocity, so maybe using another equation might be better. Like, the equation v² = u² + 2a s. Let me try that to confirm.

v² = u² + 2 a s
10² = 50² + 2*(-2)*s
100 = 2500 -4s
Subtract 2500 from both sides:
100 -2500 = -4s
-2400 = -4s
Divide by -4:
s=600 ft.

Same result, so that's good. So the length is 600 ft. 

Looking back at the options, I need to find which one has a = -2 and s=600 ft. Let me check the options:

Option C: a=-2, s=500 → No, s is 600.
Option G: a=-2, s=600 → Yes, that's the one.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Let me recalculate the distance again.

s = ut + ½ a t²
u=50, t=20, a=-2.

s = 50*20 + 0.5*(-2)*20²
s = 1000 + (-1)*400
s = 1000 -400 = 600. Yep, same result.

So the correct answer should be option G. Let me make sure none of the other options match these values.

Option G is acceleration -2 and grandstand length 600. Yep, that's correct.

To solve the problem, we start by using the kinematic equation that relates velocity, acceleration, and time:

\[
v = u + a \cdot t
\]

Given:
- Initial velocity, \( u = 50 \, \text{ft/s} \)
- Final velocity, \( v = 10 \, \text{ft/s} \)
- Time, \( t = 20 \, \text{s} \)

Substituting the values:
\[
10 = 50 + a \cdot 20
\]

Rearranging:
\[
a = \frac{10 - 50}{20} = \frac{-40}{20} = -2 \, \text{ft/s}^2
\]

Thus, the acceleration is \( a = -2 \, \text{ft/s}^2 \).

Next, to find the length of the grandstand (\( s \)), we use the kinematic equation for distance under constant acceleration:

\[
s = u \cdot t + \frac{1}{2} a \cdot t^2
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
s = 50 \cdot 20 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot (-2) \cdot 20^2
\]

Calculating each term:
\[
50 \cdot 20 = 1000, \quad \frac{1}{2} \cdot (-2) = -1, \quad 20^2 = 400
\]

\[
s = 1000 - 400 = 600 \, \text{ft}
\]

Thus, the length of the grandstand is \( s = 600 \, \text{ft} \).

Finally, comparing these results with the options provided, the correct choice is:

**G: Acceleration is -2 ft/sec² and the length of the grandstand is 600 ft.**
