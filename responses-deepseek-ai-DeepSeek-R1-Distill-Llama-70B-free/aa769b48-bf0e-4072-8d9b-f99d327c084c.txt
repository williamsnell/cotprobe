Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Carl Rogers' view of personality. I remember that Carl Rogers was a psychologist, part of the humanistic approach. Let me think about what I know about his theories.

Rogers believed that people have a natural tendency towards self-actualization, which means realizing their full potential. He talked about the concept of the "real self" and the "ideal self." The real self is who you actually are, and the ideal self is who you think you should be. When there's a discrepancy between these two, it can cause problems.

He also emphasized the importance of unconditional positive regard, which is being accepted and valued without conditions. This is crucial for healthy personality development. So, Rogers sees people as inherently good and having the potential for positive growth.

Looking at the options:

Option A says personality is formed by social roles and expectations. That sounds more like role theory or maybe something from social psychology, not Rogers.

Option B is about behavioral expectationsâ€”maybe similar to A, more about external factors shaping behavior, which doesn't quite fit Rogers' internal focus.

Option C claims personality traits are negative and destructive. No, that's more like Freud's views. Rogers was more optimistic.

Option D is about genetics determining personality. I don't think Rogers focused much on genetics; he was more about environment and personal experiences.

Option E states that personality traits are positive and goal-directed. This aligns with the idea of self-actualization and the positive view Rogers had.

Option F mentions unconscious desires, which is Freud again. Rogers wasn't much into the unconscious mind.

Option G talks about traits being constant over time. I think Rogers might have believed that people can change and grow, so traits might not be fixed.

Option H says personality is constant and unchanging. That doesn't fit because Rogers emphasized personal growth and change.

Option I says personalities vary based on traits, emotions, and thoughts. That's a bit vague, but it's true. However, it doesn't capture the essence of Rogers' specific view about the positive aspects and self-actualization.

Option J is about external environmental influences. While environment does play a role, especially in how others perceive us, Rogers' main focus was on the internal drive towards self-actualization and the person's own perceptions.

So, the best fit seems to be Option E: People's personality traits are overwhelmingly positive and goal-directed. That captures his optimistic view of human nature and the idea that people are driven towards positive growth.

Carl Rogers, a humanistic psychologist, emphasized the intrinsic positive nature of individuals and their potential for growth. He believed in self-actualization, where people strive to realize their full potential, and highlighted the importance of unconditional positive regard for healthy development. His view contrasts with more pessimistic or deterministic theories, focusing instead on the internal drive for positive growth.

Option E aligns with Rogers' optimistic perspective, emphasizing that personality traits are positive and goal-directed, reflecting his belief in self-actualization and the inherent goodness of individuals.

Answer: E
