Alright, so I've got this problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. The question is about subsets of a finite set X. The key point is that the number of subsets with exactly 3 elements is 14 more than those with exactly 2 elements. And we need to find how many subsets have exactly 4 elements.

Hmm. Okay, I remember that the number of subsets of a set with size n that contain exactly k elements is given by the binomial coefficient, which is n choose k, written as C(n, k) or sometimes as a combination formula. So, the problem is giving us a relationship between C(n,3) and C(n,2), and we need to find C(n,4).

The problem states that C(n,3) is 14 more than C(n,2). So, I can write that as:

C(n,3) = C(n,2) + 14.

I think I should express these combinations in terms of factorials to find n. Let's recall that C(n, k) = n! / (k! (n - k)!).

So, for C(n,3) it's n!/(3! (n-3)! ), and for C(n,2) it's n!/(2! (n-2)! ). 

Let me set up the equation:

n!/(3! (n-3)! ) = n!/(2! (n-2)! ) + 14.

Wait, maybe I can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by n! or something. Alternatively, I can write out the combinations in terms of n and see.

Let's compute C(n,3) and C(n,2):

C(n,2) = n*(n-1)/2,
C(n,3) = n*(n-1)*(n-2)/6.

So the equation becomes:

n(n-1)(n-2)/6 = n(n-1)/2 + 14.

Hmm, okay. Let's see. I can multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate the denominators.

6*(n(n-1)(n-2)/6) = 6*(n(n-1)/2 +14).

Simplifying:

n(n-1)(n-2) = 3n(n-1) + 84.

Wait, let's compute each term. Let me expand the left side:

n(n-1)(n-2) = n*(n² -3n +2) = n³ -3n² +2n.

The right side is 3n(n-1) +84 = 3(n² -n) +84 = 3n² -3n +84.

So putting it all together:

n³ - 3n² + 2n = 3n² -3n +84.

Let me bring all terms to one side:

n³ -3n² +2n -3n² +3n -84 =0.

Wait, wait, no. Let me subtract the right side from both sides:

n³ -3n² +2n - (3n² -3n +84) = 0.

Which is:

n³ -3n² +2n -3n² +3n -84 =0.

Combine like terms:

n³ -6n² +5n -84 =0.

Hmm, okay, so the equation to solve is n³ -6n² +5n -84=0.

I need to find the value of n that satisfies this equation. Since n is the size of a finite set, it has to be a positive integer. Let me try plugging in some small integers to see if they work.

Let me try n=5: 125 -150 +25 -84 = (125-150)= -25; (-25+25)=0; (0-84)=-84. Not zero.

n=6: 216 - 216 +30 -84 = (216-216)=0; (30-84)=-54. Not zero.

n=7: 343 - 294 +35 -84. 343-294=49; 49+35=84; 84-84=0. Oh! So n=7 is a solution.

Wait, so n=7 is a root. Therefore, the equation factors into (n-7)(something). Let me perform polynomial division or factorization.

Divide n³ -6n² +5n -84 by (n-7). Using synthetic division:

7 | 1  -6  5   -84
          7  7   84
      1   1  12    0

So the quadratic is n² +n +12. Let's check if that quadratic can be factored. The discriminant is b²-4ac =1 +48=49. Square root is 7. So roots would be (-1 ±7)/2. So (6/2)=3 and (-8/2)=-4. So the factors are (n-3)(n+4). Wait, but the quadratic is n² +n +12, which factors into (n+3)(n+4), because 3*4=12 and 3+4=7, but wait, no, wait, the quadratic is n² +n +12. Hmm, wait, the roots are n=(-1 ±7)/2, which gives 3 and -4. So the quadratic factors as (n-3)(n+4). 

Wait, but wait: (n-3)(n+4)=n² +4n -3n -12 =n² +n -12. But our quadratic is n² +n +12. Oh, that doesn't match. So that suggests I must have made a mistake. Because when I did synthetic division, I got n² +n +12 as the quadratic, which doesn't factor nicely. So that would mean that n=7 is the only real root, and the other roots are complex. But since n must be a positive integer, n=7 is the only valid solution.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the synthetic division. Let me re-calculate:

Dividing n³ -6n² +5n -84 by (n-7):

Set up the coefficients: 1 (n³), -6 (n²), 5 (n), -84 (constant).

Bring down the 1.

Multiply 1 by 7: 7. Add to -6: 1.

Multiply 1 by7:7. Add to 5: 12.

Multiply 12 by7:84. Add to -84: 0. So yes, correct.

So the quadratic is n² +n +12.

So the equation becomes (n-7)(n² +n +12)=0. The quadratic has discriminant 1^2 -4*1*12=1-48=-47 <0, so no real roots. So the only real solution is n=7.

So the set X has 7 elements.

Now, the question is to find the number of subsets of X that contain exactly 4 elements. That's C(7,4).

Compute C(7,4) = 7!/(4!3!)= (7*6*5*4!)/(4! *3*2*1) )= (7*6*5)/(3*2*1)= (210)/(6)=35.

Wait, but looking at the options, option J is 35. So the answer should be J.

Wait, but let me double-check my computation.

C(7,4)=35. Let me list the options again:

Options:

A:36, B:24, C:28, D:40, E:25, F:42, G:33, H:30, I:32, J:35.

Yes, J is 35.

The problem involves a finite set \( X \) with the property that the number of subsets of \( X \) containing exactly 3 elements is 14 more than the number of subsets containing exactly 2 elements. We need to determine how many subsets of \( X \) contain exactly 4 elements.

The number of subsets of \( X \) with exactly \( k \) elements is given by the binomial coefficient \( \binom{n}{k} \), where \( n \) is the size of the set \( X \). The problem states:

\[
\binom{n}{3} = \binom{n}{2} + 14.
\]

Using the formula for combinations, we express \( \binom{n}{3} \) and \( \binom{n}{2} \) as:

\[
\binom{n}{3} = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6}, \quad \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}.
\]

Substituting these into the equation:

\[
\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} + 14.
\]

To eliminate denominators, multiply through by 6:

\[
n(n-1)(n-2) = 3n(n-1) + 84.
\]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[
n^3 - 3n^2 + 2n = 3n^2 - 3n + 84.
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
n^3 - 6n^2 + 5n - 84 = 0.
\]

We solve this cubic equation by testing integer values for \( n \). Trying \( n = 7 \), we find it satisfies the equation. Thus, \( n = 7 \) is the size of the set \( X \).

Now, we calculate the number of subsets of \( X \) containing exactly 4 elements, which is \( \binom{7}{4} \):

\[
\binom{7}{4} = \frac{7!}{4!(7-4)!} = \frac{7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5}{3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = 35.
\]

Thus, the number of subsets of \( X \) that contain exactly 4 elements is 35, corresponding to option \( J \).
