Okay, so I've got this question about E. coli growth and calculating the percentage of the culture medium occupied by the cells. Hmm, let's see. I remember that E. coli are these rod-shaped bacteria, right? The question gives their dimensions as 2.0 micrometers long and 1.0 micrometer in diameter. Oh wait, the problem says to assume they're cylindrical, so I can model each cell as a cylinder.

The culture grows to a concentration of about 10^9 cells per cm³. I need to find what percentage of the total volume the cells take up. So the plan is to calculate the total volume of all the cells in a cm³ and then see what percentage that is compared to the total volume of the culture medium.

First, let's think about the volume of a single E. coli cell. Since it's a cylinder, the volume V = πr²h. Wait, the radius is half the diameter, so diameter is 1.0 µm, so radius r is 0.5 µm. Length h is 2.0 µm. So plugging in the numbers:

V = π * (0.5e-6 m)^2 * (2.0e-6 m). Wait, wait, no, wait—wait, no, the units. Oh, right, because we're dealing with micrometers, I should convert everything to meters to keep units consistent, but maybe I can do everything in micrometers and then convert to cm³ in the end.

Wait, 1 cm³ is equal to 1 mL, and 1 liter is 1000 cm³, but maybe I should think in terms of volume per cell and then multiply by the number of cells.

Let me compute the volume of one cell first. Radius is 0.5 µm, which is 0.5e-6 meters, but wait, no—wait, in terms of micrometers, the radius is 0.5 µm. So let's calculate in micrometers³. So:

V_cell = π * r² * h = π * (0.5)^2 * 2.0. Because r is 0.5, h is 2.0.

So 0.5 squared is 0.25. Multiply by 2 gives 0.5. So V_cell = π * 0.5 ≈ 1.5708 µm³. Wait, wait a second, no—wait, 0.5 is from 0.25 * 2. So yeah, π * 0.5 is approximately 1.57 µm³ per cell.

Wait, but wait, 0.5 µm is the radius, so 0.5 squared is 0.25, multiplied by 2.0 (the length) gives 0.5, times π gives 1.5708 µm³ per cell.

Now, the concentration is 1e9 cells per cm³. So the total volume of cells is 1e9 cells/cm³ * 1.5708 µm³/cell. Wait, I need to convert µm³ to cm³ to have consistent units.

Wait, 1 µm is 1e-6 meters, but wait, in terms of cm, 1 µm is 1e-4 cm. Because 1 cm is 10,000 µm (since 1 m is 1e6 µm, 1 cm is 0.01 m, so 1e6 * 0.01 = 1e4 µm). So 1 µm = 1e-4 cm.

So 1 µm³ is (1e-4 cm)^3 = 1e-12 cm³.

So each cell's volume is 1.5708 µm³ = 1.5708e-12 cm³.

Then, total cell volume is 1e9 cells/cm³ * 1.5708e-12 cm³/cell. Let me compute that.

1e9 * 1.5708e-12 = 1.5708e-3 cm³ per cm³ of culture. Because 1e9 is 1e9, 1.57e-12 is 1.57e-12; multiplying them gives 1.57e-3, which is 0.00157 cm³ in 1 cm³.

Wait, but wait, 1 cm³ is the total volume, so the percentage is (cell volume / total volume) * 100. So cell volume is 0.00157 cm³ in 1 cm³, so 0.00157 / 1 = 0.00157, which is 0.157%.

Looking at the options, option I is 0.157%. Let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, let's recalculate the cell volume.

Radius r = 0.5 µm, so r squared is 0.25, multiplied by height 2.0 gives 0.5. Times π is about 1.5708. So volume per cell is 1.5708 µm³.

Each µm³ is 1e-12 cm³, so per cell it's 1.5708e-12 cm³.

Number of cells is 1e9 per cm³, so total volume is 1e9 * 1.5708e-12 = 1.5708e-3 cm³ in 1 cm³. So the percentage is (1.5708e-3) / 1 * 100% = 0.15708%.

Looking at the options, option I is 0.157%, which matches. So the correct answer should be I.

To determine the percentage of the culture medium occupied by E. coli cells at a concentration of \(10^9\) cells per cm\(^3\), we start by calculating the volume of a single cell. Assuming the cell is cylindrical with a length of \(2.0 \, \mu\)m and a diameter of \(1.0 \, \mu\)m, the radius is \(0.5 \, \mu\)m. The volume of a cylinder is given by:

\[
V_{\text{cell}} = \pi r^2 h
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
r = 0.5 \, \mu\text{m}, \quad h = 2.0 \, \mu\text{m}
\]
\[
V_{\text{cell}} = \pi (0.5)^2 (2.0) = \pi (0.25) (2.0) = \pi (0.5) \approx 1.5708 \, \mu\text{m}^3
\]

Next, we convert the cell volume from \(\mu\text{m}^3\) to cm\(^3\). Since \(1 \, \mu\text{m} = 10^{-4} \, \text{cm}\), \(1 \, \mu\text{m}^3 = (10^{-4})^3 = 10^{-12} \, \text{cm}^3\). Thus:
\[
V_{\text{cell}} = 1.5708 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{cm}^3
\]

At a concentration of \(10^9\) cells per cm\(^3\), the total volume of all cells in 1 cm\(^3\) of culture is:
\[
V_{\text{total}} = (10^9) (1.5708 \times 10^{-12}) = 1.5708 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{cm}^3
\]

The percentage of the total volume occupied by the cells is:
\[
\text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{V_{\text{total}}}{1 \, \text{cm}^3}\right) \times 100 = \left(\frac{1.5708 \times 10^{-3}}{1}\right) \times 100 = 0.157\%
\]

Comparing this result to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**I: 0.157%**
