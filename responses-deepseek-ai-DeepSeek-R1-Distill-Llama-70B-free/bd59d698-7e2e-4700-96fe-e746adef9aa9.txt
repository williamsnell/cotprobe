Okay, so I need to figure out which Hindu festival involves decorating the house with lights, setting off firecrackers, and wearing new clothes. Let me think about the different festivals I know.

First, I remember Diwali is a big one. Diwali is known as the festival of lights. People light diyas and decorate their homes with lights. They also burst firecrackers, which I think is a common tradition. And wearing new clothes is part of the celebration too, as it's a time for renewal and happiness.

Let me go through the options given. Option G is Deepavali, which I think is another name for Diwali. So that fits the description. 

Wait, but I should make sure none of the other options fit better. Let's see:

A: Pongal is a harvest festival, mainly in South India. They make pongal dishes and decorate with kolams, but I don't recall it being about lights or firecrackers as much.

B: Ganesh Chaturthi is about Ganesh, where they set up idols and then immerse them. Not sure about the lights and firecrackers being central.

C: Janmashtami is Krishna's birthday. Celebrations include dances and sometimes breaking pots, but not particularly lights and firecrackers as main elements.

D: Holi is the color festival, with throwing colors and water. Not really about lights or new clothes in that way.

E: Karva Chauth is a fasting festival for women, more about rituals and not the elements mentioned.

F: Makar Sankranti is another harvest festival, where they fly kites. I don't think lights and firecrackers are the main focus here.

H: Navaratri is nine nights of dance and worship, like Garba. Not the same as the description.

I: Raksha Bandhan is about brothers and sisters, tying rakhi. Not related to lights or fireworks.

So yeah, Deepavali (option G) is definitely the one. It's all about lights, fireworks, and new clothes to celebrate the victory of light over darkness.
