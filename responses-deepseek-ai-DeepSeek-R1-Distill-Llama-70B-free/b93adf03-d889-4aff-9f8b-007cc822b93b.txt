Okay, so I've got this question here about the Bohr model and atomic nuclei. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Alright, the question is asking at what value of Z the innermost orbit would be pulled inside a nucleus of a certain radius. The nucleus has a radius of 1.0 × 10^-13 cm. And they give the Bohr radius as 0.5292 × 10^-8 cm. Oh right, and N is 1, so that's the principal quantum number, meaning it's the first orbit or the innermost one.

Wait, I remember that in the Bohr model, the radius of the nth orbit is given by r_n = (n^2 * a_0) / Z, where a_0 is the Bohr radius. Oh wait, wait, actually, I think the formula is r_n = (n² * a₀) / Z. So for the innermost orbit, n=1, so r_1 = a₀ / Z.

But wait, the nucleus has a radius R. So the orbit will be pulled inside the nucleus when r_1 < R. So we need to find when a₀ / Z < R. Oh, wait no, because the orbit has to be smaller than the nucleus' size. So rearranging, Z > a₀ / R. Because if Z is bigger, the radius is smaller.

Wait, let me double-check. The radius of the orbit decreases with increasing Z. So when Z is high enough, the orbit radius r_1 becomes smaller than the nucleus' radius. So yes, we set r_1 = R and solve for Z.

Wait, but the question says "pulled inside the nucleus", which I think means when the orbit radius (r_n) is less than the nucleus radius R. So we need to find Z such that r_1 < R. Rearranging the formula, Z = a₀/(r_1). But since r_1 must be less than R, perhaps we set r_1 equal to R to find the Z at which it's just at the edge, and beyond which it's pulled in.

Wait, no. Let me think. The innermost orbit in Bohr theory is when n=1. So, the radius of that orbit is r = a₀ * (n²/Z) = a₀ / Z. So when r becomes smaller than the nucleus's radius, the electron would be pulled inside. So we set a₀/Z = R, and solve for Z. Because for Z larger than that value, the orbit would be smaller than R.

Wait, no, wait another way. Let's calculate when r_1 equals R. Then Z = a₀ / R. Because r_1 = a₀ / Z = R => Z = a₀ / R.

Ah, right. So that would be the critical Z where the orbit radius equals the nucleus radius. So for Z greater than that, the orbit would be smaller, meaning the electron is inside the nucleus. So we need to compute Z = a₀ / R.

Alright, plugging in the numbers. a₀ is 0.5292e-8 cm, R is 1.0e-13 cm.

Calculating Z: Z = (0.5292e-8 cm) / (1.0e-13 cm) = 0.5292e5 (since 1e-8 / 1e-13 = 1e5).

Wait, 0.5292e5 is 5.292e4. So Z is 5.292 × 10^4.

Let me look at the options. Option C is 5.292e4. So the correct answer should be C.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Did I flip numerator and denominator?

Wait, no, because R is 1e-13, which is much smaller than a₀ (0.5e-8). So a₀ is bigger than R, so when we compute a₀ / R, it's a big number. Let's calculate 0.5292e-8 divided by 1e-13.

0.5292e-8 = 5.292e-9.

Wait no: 0.5292e-8 is 5.292 × 10^-9? Wait no, wait, 1e-8 is 0.00000001, so 0.5292e-8 is 5.292 × 10^-9. Wait no, wait, 0.5292e-8 equals 5.292 × 10^-9? No, wait, 0.5e-8 is 5e-9. So yes, 0.5292e-8 is 5.292e-9.

Wait, no, wait. No no no! Wait, 0.5292 × 10^-8 cm is 5.292 × 10^-9 cm. Because 0.5292 is 5.292 × 10^-1, so 10^-1 × 10^-8 = 10^-9. So yeah, 5.292e-9 cm.

And R is 1e-13 cm. So when you divide 5.292e-9 by 1e-13, you get (5.292e-9) / (1e-13) ) = 5.292e4, because 1e-9 / 1e-13 is 1e4.

So Z = 5.292 × 10^4. So option C is correct.

I think that's right, so the answer is C.

To determine the value of \( Z \) at which the innermost orbit is pulled inside a nucleus of radius \( R = 1.0 \times 10^{-13} \, \text{cm} \), we use the Bohr model. The radius of the \( n \)-th orbit in the Bohr model is given by:

\[
r_n = \frac{n^2 a_0}{Z},
\]

where \( a_0 = 0.5292 \times 10^{-8} \, \text{cm} \) is the Bohr radius, \( n \) is the principal quantum number, and \( Z \) is the atomic number. For the innermost orbit, \( n = 1 \), so the radius simplifies to:

\[
r_1 = \frac{a_0}{Z}.
\]

The orbit will be pulled inside the nucleus when \( r_1 < R \). Setting \( r_1 = R \) (the critical case where the orbit radius equals the nucleus radius), we solve for \( Z \):

\[
Z = \frac{a_0}{R}.
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
Z = \frac{0.5292 \times 10^{-8}}{1.0 \times 10^{-13}}.
\]

Performing the calculation:

\[
Z = 0.5292 \times 10^5 = 5.292 \times 10^4.
\]

Thus, for \( Z > 5.292 \times 10^4 \), the innermost orbit will be pulled inside the nucleus. Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**C: \( 5.292 \times 10^4 \).**
