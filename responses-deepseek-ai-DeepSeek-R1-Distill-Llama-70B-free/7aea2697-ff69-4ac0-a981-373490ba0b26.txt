Okay, so I've got this problem here about heating water in a pipe. Hmm, let me try to understand what's going on. So, the question says that water at 340 K is needed for a process, and it's flowing at a rate of 4 kg/hr. The water available is at 300 K, so it needs to be heated as it passes through this pipe. The pipe has an inner diameter of 7 mm, and it provides 125 W per meter of its length. I need to find out how long the pipe should be and what the maximum temperature at the exit would be.

Wait, so the pipe provides 125 W per meter. That probably means that each meter of the pipe adds 125 Watts of heat to the water. So the total power depends on the length. Got it.

I remember that when dealing with heat transfer to a fluid flowing in a pipe, the basic principle involves the energy balance. The heat added to the fluid will increase its temperature. So the formula should relate the heat transfer rate (Q) to the mass flow rate (m_dot), specific heat capacity (c_p), and the temperature change (ΔT).

The formula is Q = m_dot * c_p * (T_out - T_in). Since the water is flowing through the pipe, T_out is the temperature at the exit, which is what we're trying to find. But wait, in this case, the required temperature is 340 K, so that's the T_out we're aiming for. The pipe's heating will provide the necessary Q.

But wait, the problem mentions the maximum temperature at the exit. Oh, maybe if the pipe is long enough, the exit temperature could go beyond 340 K, but since the process requires it, perhaps 340 K is the desired, so that's what we calculate the length for. But the options include higher temperatures, so maybe the pipe's heat input is more than needed, and the exit temp would be higher than 340 K. Hmm, I'm a bit confused there.

Wait no, the question says that water at 340 K is required. So the process needs it at that temp. So the exit temp should be 340 K, right? But the options don't have 340 as the exit temp. Looking at the options, the exit temps are higher, like 345, 350, etc. So maybe the pipe provides heat that would take it beyond 340? Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.

Wait, let me think again. The process requires water at 340 K, so the water must be heated from 300 K to 340 K. So the exit temperature needs to be 340 K. So the heat added should be just enough to cause that temperature rise.

So, let's model this. The heat provided by the pipe per unit length is 125 W/m, so for a length L, the total heat is Q = 125 * L Watts.

The mass flow rate is 4 kg/hr. To use the formula, I should convert this into kg/s because the heat is in Watts (Joules per second). So 4 kg/hr is 4/3600 kg/s, which is approximately 0.001111 kg/s.

The specific heat capacity of water is about 4186 J/kg·K.

So, the heat required is Q = m_dot * c_p * (T_out - T_in).

We need T_out to be 340 K, so T_in is 300 K. So ΔT is 40 K.

Putting numbers in:

Q = (4/3600 kg/s) * 4186 J/kg·K * (340-300) K
= (0.001111) * 4186 * 40

Let me compute that. 0.001111 * 4186 is approximately 4.64. Multiply by 40 gives about 185.6 Watts. So Q is about 185.6 W.

Wait, but the pipe provides 125 W per meter. So the total heat Q is 125 * L. So 125 L = 185.6 → L = 185.6 / 125 = approx 1.485 meters, around 1.49 m. Looking at the options, option B is 1.48 m and exit temp 354.8 K. But wait, why is the exit temp higher than 340?

Oh wait, maybe I messed up. Because maybe the calculation gives the exit temp as higher than needed, but the process requires exactly 340. So perhaps the pipe's length is such that the heat input would make the exit temp higher than 340, but in reality, we can't have that. So perhaps the problem is about determining the maximum possible temp achievable, given a certain length. Or maybe I've got the problem wrong.

Wait the first part of the question says that water is required at 340 K. So maybe the exit temp is supposed to be exactly 340 K, so that's what we're aiming for. Then the length calculated would be 1.48 m, which is option B's length. But option B's exit temp is 354.8 K. That doesn't fit. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is that the pipe provides a certain heating, and we need to find the length required to reach 340, and then also find what would be the maximum possible temp if the pipe were longer than needed. Wait, but the question says "determine the length of piping required and the maximum temperature at the exit." Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the maximum temp is when all the heat is absorbed by the water, but maybe the water can't absorb all the heat, or perhaps the pipe's heating is more than needed. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that the pipe is providing a constant heat flux, and the length determines the total heat. So, when you have a longer pipe, more heat is added, so higher exit temp.

Wait, but the process requires the water to be at 340 K. So, the pipe must be long enough to heat it to that temp, but not longer, because then the temp would be higher, which might not be desired. But the question is asking for the length needed for 340 K and the maximum exit temp. Hmm, perhaps the maximum exit temp would be when the pipe is as long as possible, but that's not clear. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum exit temp is when the pipe is infinitely long, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it step by step.

First, compute the required heat to raise the temp from 300 to 340 K. Then, find the length of pipe that would provide exactly that heat.

Then, the exit temp would be 340 K. But in the options, the exit temps are higher. So perhaps I've made a mistake.

Wait, maybe the question is that the pipe provides 125 W per meter, but that's the power, and the water is flowing through it. So the longer the pipe, the more heat is added, thus higher exit temp.

So, if the process requires 340 K, then the length needed is the one that provides enough Q to get to 340 K. But the options don't have 340 as the exit temp. So perhaps the options are presenting the max temp when the pipe is longer than needed.

Wait, perhaps the question is that the pipe is providing 125 W per meter, but the water is flowing, and we have to find the length needed to reach 340 K, and then what's the maximum temp possible if the pipe is longer. Hmm, but the question says "determine the length of piping required and the maximum temperature at the exit." So perhaps the first part is the length needed for 340 K, and the second is the maximum possible exit temp, which might be higher than 340, perhaps when the pipe is longer, but that's not clear.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum temp is the exit temp when the pipe is the required length. Oh wait, no, the required length would give 340 K. So perhaps the question has a typo.

Wait, maybe I should just proceed with the calculation.

So, the required Q is 185.6 W, as I calculated earlier.

Since each meter of pipe provides 125 W, then the length L is 185.6 / 125 = 1.4848 m, which is approximately 1.48 m. So option B's length is 1.48 m.

But option B's exit temp is 354.8 K, which is higher than 340. So that doesn't make sense. Unless I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Mass flow rate: 4 kg/hr = 4/3600 kg/s = 0.0011111 kg/s.

Specific heat of water, c_p = 4186 J/kg·K.

Delta T is 40 K (340 - 300).

So Q = m_dot * c_p * delta_T = 0.0011111 * 4186 * 40.

Compute 0.0011111 * 4186:

0.0011111 * 4000 = 4.4444

0.0011111 * 186 = approx 0.2066.

So total is approximately 4.4444 + 0.2066 = 4.651 J/s = 4.651 Watts.

Wait, that can't be right because 4.65 W is way too low. Wait, no, 4186 is in J/kg·K. So 0.0011111 kg/s * 4186 J/kg·K * 40 K.

0.0011111 * 4186 = approx 4.64 J/s·K.

Multiply by 40 K gives 4.64 *40 = 185.6 J/s, which is 185.6 Watts. Yes, that's correct.

So Q = 185.6 W.

Each meter of pipe provides 125 W, so L = 185.6 / 125 = 1.4848 m.

So the length is approximately 1.48 m, which matches option B.

But option B's exit temp is 354.8 K. So why is the exit temp higher than 340 K?

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I've misunderstood the setup.

Wait, perhaps the question is that the pipe provides 125 W per meter, but the water's flow rate is such that the heat transfer is limited. Maybe the pipe's heating is more than what's needed, but the exit temp can't exceed a certain value based on the flow rate and specific heat.

Wait, perhaps the maximum temperature occurs when the entire heat from the pipe is absorbed by the water. So if the pipe is longer than needed, the exit temp would be higher. But since the process requires 340 K, perhaps the pipe is exactly the length to reach 340 K, so the exit temp is 340 K. But the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about finding the length required to reach 340 K and the maximum possible temp if the pipe is longer than that, but that's not clear.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the pipe provides a certain amount of heat per meter, which is 125 W/m. So the total heat Q = 125 * L.

But the energy required to heat the water is Q = m_dot * c_p * (T_exit - T_in).

So, T_exit = T_in + Q/(m_dot * c_p).

Plugging in the numbers:

m_dot = 4 kg/hr = 4/3600 kg/s ≈0.001111 kg/s.

c_p =4186 J/kg·K.

So T_exit = 300 + (125*L) / (0.001111 *4186).

Compute denominator: 0.001111 *4186 ≈4.64.

So T_exit = 300 + (125 L)/4.64.

So, 125 /4.64 ≈26.936.

So T_exit = 300 + 26.936 * L.

We need T_exit =340 K.

So 340 =300 +26.936 L → 40=26.936 L → L=40/26.936 ≈1.484 m, same as before.

So, at L=1.484 m, T_exit=340 K.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps the question is not about the required temp, but about the maximum possible when the pipe is longer.

Wait, the question says: determine the length required and the maximum temperature at the exit. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the maximum temperature is when the pipe is as long as possible, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum possible temp is when the pipe's heating is sufficient to cause the temp to rise as much as possible, but that would require an infinitely long pipe, which is impractical.

Wait, perhaps the question intended that the exit temp is 340 K, so the length is 1.48 m, and the maximum temp would be if the pipe were longer, but the process only needs 340. But the options don't have 340 as the exit temp.

Looking at the options, option B has 1.48 m and 354.8 K. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's recalculate T_exit.

T_exit =300 + (125 L)/(m_dot c_p).

But wait, perhaps I should use the correct units.

Wait, m_dot is 4 kg/hr. Let's convert that to kg/s.

4 kg/hr = 4 / 3600 = 0.0011111 kg/s.

c_p =4186 J/kg·K.

So, (m_dot c_p) = 0.0011111 *4186 ≈4.64 J/s, which is 4.64 W per Kelvin.

So, for a length L, Q=125 L W.

So, ΔT = Q/(m_dot c_p) = (125 L)/4.64 ≈26.936 * L.

So, T_exit =300 +26.936 L.

So, when L=1.48 m,

T_exit= 300 +26.936 *1.48 ≈300 + (26.936 *1.48).

Compute 26.936 *1.48:

26 *1.48=38.48

0.936 *1.48≈1.386

Total ≈38.48+1.386=39.866.

So, T_exit≈300+39.866≈339.866 K, approximately 340 K. So that's correct.

But in option B, the exit temp is 354.8 K, which is higher than 340. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the pipe provides 125 W per meter of its length, but the pipe's length is more than needed, and we're to find the exit temp, but that doesn't align with the question.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is that the pipe can provide 125 W per meter, but the maximum possible temp occurs when all the heat is transferred. Wait, but the water is flowing, so as the pipe gets longer, more heat is added, leading to higher temp.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the length required to reach 340 K, and the maximum possible temp if the pipe were longer. But the options don't match that. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum temp is when the pipe is just enough to reach 340 K, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again.

Option B: length 1.48 m, exit temp 354.8 K.

Wait, but according to our calculation, 1.48 m gives 340 K. So why is option B showing a higher temp?

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in the units for the mass flow rate. Let me check.

Wait, the mass flow rate is 4 kg/hr. Did I convert that correctly?

Yes, 4 kg/hr = 4/3600 kg/s = 0.001111 kg/s.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the pipe's power is 125 W per meter, but perhaps the calculation uses the pipe's length to determine the total power, and then the temperature rise.

Wait, but according to the earlier calculation, with L=1.48 m, Q=125*1.48=185 W. Then, using Q= m_dot c_p (T_exit - T_in):

185 = 0.001111 *4186 (T_exit -300).

Compute denominator: 0.001111*4186≈4.64.

So, T_exit-300 = 185 /4.64 ≈39.86 K.

So, T_exit≈339.86 K, which is about 340 K.

So, option B's exit temp is 354.8 K, which is higher. So perhaps the question intended for the pipe to provide 125 W, not per meter. But the question says 125 W per meter.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the maximum temp possible when the pipe's length is such that it's providing enough heat, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this using the formula for heat transfer in a pipe, considering the flow and the heating.

Wait, another approach: the heating power per unit length is 125 W/m. The mass flow rate is 4 kg/hr, specific heat 4186 J/kg·K.

The temperature rise per meter would be:

ΔT per meter = (125 W/m) / (m_dot * c_p).

m_dot is 4 kg/hr = 0.001111 kg/s.

So ΔT/m = 125 / (0.001111 *4186) ≈125 /4.64 ≈26.936 K/m.

So each meter of pipe increases the temp by about 26.936 K.

So, to get from 300 K to 340 K, a ΔT of 40 K is needed.

So length L=40 /26.936 ≈1.484 m.

So that's correct, the length is about 1.48 m, and exit temp 340 K.

But again, the options don't have 340 K. So perhaps the question is different. Maybe the process requires 340 K, but the pipe can only heat it so much, and we're to find the exit temp? No, that doesn't fit either.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the maximum possible temperature when the pipe is as long as needed, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the question is that the pipe is 7mm in diameter, and we need to consider the velocity and Reynolds number, but that's probably beyond the scope here.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula Q = m_dot c_p (T_out - T_in) is correct, where Q is the heat added.

So, if the pipe's heat per length is 125 W/m, then total Q =125 * L.

So, 125 L = m_dot c_p (T_out -300).

We can solve for T_out:

T_out =300 + (125 L)/(m_dot c_p).

So, for L=1.48 m,

T_out=300 + (125*1.48)/(0.001111*4186).

Compute denominator: 0.001111 *4186 ≈4.64.

So numerator:125 *1.
