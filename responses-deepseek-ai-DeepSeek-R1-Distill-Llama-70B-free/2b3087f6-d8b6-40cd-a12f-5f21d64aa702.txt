Question:

\textquotedblleftNew business firms can under price older firms, because thenewer firms can buy the latest equipment and are not bur-denedwith the older, less economical equipment which olderfirms must retire before they can economically adopt thenew. This is why continued technological progress contributesto maintaining a competitive economic system." Explain the er-rors in both sentences.

Options:

A: Older firms have the advantage as they can use their established reputation to outcompete new firms
B: Technological progress always promotes competition
C: New and old firms both benefit equally from technological progress, maintaining a balanced competition
D: Old firms can switch to new goods and continued technological progress can create barriers to entry
E: The cost of new technology is always low enough for new firms to afford it without financial strain
F: Technological progress ensures that all firms have equal access to new equipment
G: New firms have a disadvantage due to lack of experience, regardless of equipment
H: Old firms can't retire old equipment
I: New firms can't buy the latest equipment
J: Old firms are more adaptable to technological changes than new firms due to their extensive industry knowledge

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's break it down step by step.

The question is about explaining the errors in two sentences regarding new and old business firms and technological progress. The first part says that new firms can underprice older ones because they can buy the latest equipment, implying that older firms are stuck with outdated, less efficient equipment. The second part claims that technological progress maintains a competitive economic system because of this.

Hmm, I remember from my economics class that there are a few concepts here. Let me think about each part.

First, the argument that new firms can underprice older ones because they have newer equipment. Well, that might not always be the case. I recall something about sunk costs and how older firms might have already depreciated their older equipment. So maybe the older firms don't have to worry as much about the costs of old machinery because they've already written them off. That would mean that their operational costs might not be as high as the new firms think. Also, older firms might have other advantages, like established brand reputation or customer loyalty, which can help them compete even if new firms have better technology.

Wait, but the first sentence says new firms can underprice because they have the latest equipment. If older firms can't adopt new tech until they retire old equipment, that might slow them down. But maybe older firms don't need to adopt every new technology immediately, especially if their current equipment is still efficient enough. Or perhaps they can find ways to integrate new technologies without completely replacing all old equipment.

Now, the second part says that technological progress maintains competition. But I think that's not necessarily true. Technological progress can sometimes lead to monopolies or oligopolies if only a few firms can afford the new technologies. For example, if new equipment is expensive, only large, established firms might be able to invest, which can create barriers to entry for new firms. This would reduce competition over time, contrary to what the statement says.

So the errors in the first sentence would be assuming that older firms are burdened with old equipment costs, when in reality, they might have already absorbed those costs and can focus on variable costs. Also, older firms might have other competitive advantages beyond just equipment.

The error in the second sentence is that technological progress doesn't always promote competition. In fact, it can sometimes lead to concentration and less competition if the new technology is capital-intensive and only accessible to larger firms.

Looking at the options now:

Option A: Older firms have an advantage because of reputation. That makes sense because reputation can help them maintain market share even against newer, cheaper competitors.

Option B: Tech progress always promotes competition. This is incorrect because, as I thought, it might lead to less competition.

Option C: Both benefit equally. Not necessarily; it depends on access to capital and other factors.

Option D: Old firms can switch to new goods, and tech progress creates barriers. Wait, the original statement says older firms have to retire old equipment before adopting new. So if old firms can switch, that's a counterpoint. Also, tech progress can create barriers, which would mean that the second sentence's claim is wrong because it's supposed to maintain competition but actually might reduce it.

Option E: Cost of new tech is low for new firms. Not necessarily; maybe it's expensive.

Option F: All firms have equal access. Unlikely, as access depends on capital.

Option G: New firms are disadvantaged due to lack of experience. That's possible, but the first part of the question was about equipment, so maybe not the main error.

Option H: Old firms can't retire old equipment. That's the opposite of what the statement says. The statement says older firms must retire before adopting new, so H is incorrect as an error.

Option I: New firms can't buy latest equipment. That's the opposite of the first part, which says they can.

Option J: Old firms are more adaptable. Not sure, but I think older firms might have more resources to adapt, but the question was about the errors in the given statements.

Wait, the question is asking for the errors in both sentences. The first sentence claims new firms can underprice because they have new equipment, while older firms are burdened. The errors would be that older firms may not be burdened as much (they might have lower costs due to depreciated assets) and that new firms might face other hurdles, like reputation or access to capital.

Looking back, the options need to point out these errors. Option D says old firms can switch to new goods and tech progress creates barriers. That would mean the first part is wrong because old firms can switch, so new firms can't necessarily underprice. Also, the second part is wrong because tech progress creates barriers, so it doesn't maintain competition.

So the errors are: in the first sentence, the assumption that older firms can't adopt new tech without retiring old, and that new firms can easily underprice. The second sentence's error is that tech progress doesn't necessarily maintain competition.

So the correct answer should point out that old firms can switch to new goods (so the first part is wrong) and that tech progress can create barriers, making the second part wrong.

Looking at the options, D says exactly that: "Old firms can switch to new goods and continued technological progress can create barriers to entry."

So I think the correct answer is D.

The question examines the errors in two statements about new and old business firms and technological progress. The first statement claims that new firms can underprice older firms because they can buy the latest equipment, while older firms are burdened with outdated equipment. The second statement asserts that technological progress maintains a competitive economic system.

The first statement is flawed because it assumes older firms are significantly burdened by outdated equipment. In reality, older firms may have already depreciated their equipment, reducing their operational costs. Additionally, older firms often have advantages such as brand reputation, customer loyalty, and established market positions, which can help them compete effectively. The second statement is also incorrect because technological progress does not always promote competition. In some cases, it can lead to monopolies or oligopolies, especially when new technologies are expensive and accessible only to large, established firms, creating barriers to entry for new firms.

Among the options provided, **Option D** correctly identifies the errors: older firms can switch to new goods, undermining the first statement, and technological progress can create barriers to entry, contradicting the second statement's claim that it maintains competition.

Answer: D
