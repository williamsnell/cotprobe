Question:

A man was standing on a street corner when a police officer approached him. The officer gently grabbed the man's arm and said, "Hey, I want to talk to you. " The man responded, "About what . . . I'm in a hurry to go home and watch the baseball game. " The officer then remarked, "Listen, what were you doing at the liquor store last week?" The man stated, "All right, man, I was there during the robbery. " Whereupon, the officer placed the man under arrest and charged him with robbery. The man was taken to police headquarters where he was booked. For the first time, he was given his Miranda warnings. He then waived his rights and confessed to being an accessory during the liquor store robbery. Afterward, the court appointed an attorney to represent the man. The attorney moved to suppress both statements the man gave to the police. The trial court granted the motion with respect to the first statement as a violation of Miranda. The man's attorney now moves to suppress the secondstatement given at the police headquarters. This motion should be

Options:

A: granted, because the man didn't have an attorney present during the second statement.
B: not granted, because the first statement doesn't affect the legality of the second.
C: not granted, because the second statement was volunteered after a knowing Miranda waiver.
D: not granted, because the man had already confessed to the crime.
E: not granted, because the man willingly gave the second statement.
F: granted, because the first statement was excluded, and the second statement is tainted.
G: granted, because the man was not informed of his rights before the second statement.
H: not granted, because the Miranda warning was correctly given before the second statement.
I: granted, because the man was under duress during the second statement.
J: granted, because the second statement was the fruit of the first statement.

Okay, so I have this legal question here about Miranda rights and whether a statement should be suppressed. Let me try to break it down step by step.

So the scenario is: A man is approached by a police officer on the street. The officer grabs his arm and says he wants to talk. The man asks what it's about and mentions he's in a hurry. The officer then asks what he was doing at the liquor store during a robbery. The man says he was there during the robbery. Then the officer arrests him and takes him to headquarters. There, he's booked and given Miranda warnings for the first time, waives his rights, and confesses to being an accessory.

The attorney moves to suppress both statements. The court already granted the motion for the first statement because of Miranda violation. Now, the attorney is moving to suppress the second statement. The question is whether this motion should be granted or not.

I remember that Miranda warnings are required when a person is in custody and being interrogated. If the warnings aren't given, any statements made can be suppressed. But here, the first statement was made on the street when the officer grabbed his arm. The issue is whether that counts as a custodial situation.

Wait, so the first statement was when the man was on the street. The officer grabbed his arm and asked him a question. I'm trying to recall if that's considered custody. I think the key is whether a reasonable person would feel free to leave. If the officer is holding his arm, maybe that's enough to constitute custody. So the first statement was made without Miranda, hence the court suppressed it. That makes sense.

Now the second statement is at the police station. He was booked and given Miranda warnings. He waived them and confessed. The question is whether this second statement is admissible.

I remember the concept of the "fruit of the poisonous tree." If the first statement was obtained illegally, any evidence derived from it might also be tainted. But wait, in this case, the second statement was made after Miranda warnings were properly given. So the issue is whether the second statement is voluntary and not tainted by the first.

Another point is whether the first statement being suppressed affects the second. But I think each statement is evaluated on its own circumstances. So even if the first was bad, the second could still be okay if the proper procedures were followed.

Wait, but the man was under arrest when he made the second statement. So, when he was at the station, he was in custody. But since he was given Miranda warnings and waived them, that should make the second statement admissible. The fact that he waived them knowingly would mean the statement is voluntary.

Looking at the options:

Option C says the second statement was volunteered after a knowing Miranda waiver. That sounds correct. So the motion shouldn't be granted; the statement is admissible.

Option F says the second is tainted because the first was excluded. But I think that's not right unless there's a direct connection. Here, the second was made after Miranda was given, so it's a separate issue.

Option J says it's the fruit of the first statement. But I don't think so because the second statement was made after proper warnings.

So the correct answer would be C or H. Let me think again. The second statement was after Miranda, so it's valid. So the court shouldn't suppress it. So the motion should not be granted. Looking at the options, C says "not granted because the second was volunteered after knowing waiver." H says "not granted because Miranda was correctly given before the second."

Wait, the options are phrased as whether the motion should be granted or not. The question is whether the second statement should be suppressed. The options are whether the motion to suppress should be granted.

So the motion is to suppress the second statement. If the statement was properly Miranda-ized, then the motion shouldn't be granted.

Looking at the options again:

Option C: Not granted because the second was volunteered after knowing waiver.

Option H: Not granted because Miranda was correctly given before the second.

Wait, in the scenario, the man was given Miranda warnings at headquarters for the first time. So before the second statement, he was warned. So H's reasoning is correct. But the answer would be that the motion to suppress the second statement is not granted because the Miranda warning was correctly given before it.

So the correct answer would be H.

Wait, but option C says it was volunteered after a knowing waiver. So that's also a reason it's admissible. So either C or H could be correct. But H is more directly addressing the Miranda issue.

I think the key is that the second statement was made after proper Miranda warnings, so it's admissible. Therefore, the motion to suppress should not be granted. So the answer would be either C or H.

Wait, in the scenario, the man was given the Miranda warnings at the police headquarters, so before the second statement. So H's reasoning applies.

So the correct answer is H: not granted, because the Miranda warning was correctly given before the second statement.

Wait, but another point: the first statement was obtained without Miranda, but the second was after. So the two are separate. Therefore, the second is admissible.

So the answer is H.

The scenario involves a man who made two statements to the police: the first on the street without Miranda warnings and the second at police headquarters after being given Miranda warnings. The first statement was suppressed due to a Miranda violation. The question is whether the second statement, made after proper Miranda warnings, should also be suppressed.

Key points:
1. **First Statement**: Made on the street when the officer grabbed the man's arm. This was likely a custodial situation, and since no Miranda warnings were given, the statement was properly suppressed.
2. **Second Statement**: Made at police headquarters after the man was given Miranda warnings, which he waived. This statement was made voluntarily and with proper procedures.

The motion to suppress the second statement should not be granted because the second statement was made after Miranda warnings were correctly given. Each statement is evaluated on its own circumstances, and the second statement is admissible because it was made after a knowing and voluntary waiver of Miranda rights.

**Analysis of Options**:
- **Option C**: Correctly states that the second statement was volunteered after a knowing Miranda waiver.
- **Option H**: Correctly emphasizes that the Miranda warning was properly given before the second statement, making it admissible.

Both C and H are valid reasons, but H directly addresses the Miranda issue, making it the most appropriate choice.

**Answer**: H
