Question:

John’s friend told him that he could earn $49 for handing out flyers at a local concert. John wants to calculate the hourly rate, If he works a total of 3.5 hours, the equation 3.5x = 49 can be used to determine his hourly rate. What would John’s hourly rate be, in dollars?

Options:

A: $28.00
B: $10.50
C: $171.50 
D: $1.40 
E: $45.50 
F: $7.00
G: $35.00
H: $14.00 
I: $17.50
J: $21.00

Okay, so I need to figure out John's hourly rate. His friend told him he could earn $49 for handing out flyers at a concert. John is going to work for 3.5 hours, and the equation given is 3.5x = 49. I think I should solve for x here because x represents the hourly rate.

Hmm, the equation is 3.5 multiplied by x equals 49. To find x, I need to isolate it. So I'll divide both sides of the equation by 3.5. Let me write that down: x = 49 / 3.5. 

Wait, what's 49 divided by 3.5? I'm not exactly sure off the top of my head, so maybe I should calculate it step by step. 3.5 times what gives me 49? Let me think. 3.5 times 10 is 35, right? Because 3.5 * 10 = 35. So 35 is less than 49. The difference is 14. 3.5 goes into 14 four times because 3.5 * 4 =14. So 10 +4 =14. So 3.5 *14 =49. So x must be 14. 

Looking at the options, option H is $14.00. So that should be the correct answer. 

Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. If John works 3.5 hours at $14 per hour, then 3.5 *14 equals 49. 3.5 times 10 is 35, 3.5 times 4 is 14, so 35+14 is 49. Yep, that checks out. So the hourly rate is definitely $14.00.

To determine John's hourly rate, we solve the equation \(3.5x = 49\). Dividing both sides by 3.5 gives \(x = \frac{49}{3.5} = 14\). Thus, John's hourly rate is $14.00.

The correct answer is H.
