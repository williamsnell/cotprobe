Question:

You and three friends go to a concert. The total cost for four tickets is $112. Write and solve an equation to find the cost of one ticket t.

Options:

A: 4 - t = 112; -$108
B: 4t = 112; $28
C: t over 4 = 112; $448
D: t + 4 = 112; $108
E: t over 4 = 112; $28
F: 4t - 112 = 0; $448
G: 4t = 112; $448
H: t/112 = 4; $0.0357
I: 112t = 4; $44800
J: t - 4 = 112; $116

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where four friends go to a concert, and the total cost for the tickets is $112. I need to find out how much one ticket costs. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, the problem says the total cost for four tickets is $112. That means if I can find the cost per ticket, I can multiply that by four to get the total. Wait, no, actually, it's the other way around. If I have the total and I want one ticket, I should divide the total by four. Or wait, maybe set up an equation.

Let me think. Let's say the cost of one ticket is t. Since there are four tickets, the total cost would be 4 times t. So the equation should be 4t equals 112. Yeah, that makes sense because 4 multiplied by the price of one ticket gives the total cost.

So the equation is 4t = 112. To solve for t, I need to get t by itself. I should divide both sides of the equation by 4. So t equals 112 divided by 4. Let me calculate that: 112 divided by 4 is 28. So t equals 28 dollars.

Now I need to check the options to see which one matches this. Let's look at each option.

Option A: 4 - t = 112; -$108. That doesn't make sense. Subtracting t from 4 would give a negative number if t is 28, but the equation doesn't fit the problem. Plus the answer is negative, which doesn't make sense for a ticket price.

Option B: 4t = 112; $28. Oh, this matches exactly what I did. The equation is correct, and the solution is $28. So this looks like the right answer. But let me check the other options just to be sure.

Option C: t over 4 equals 112; $448. Wait, that's t/4=112, which would mean t is 448. That's way too high because four tickets would cost 4*448=1792, which is way more than 112. So that's not right.

Option D: t +4=112. So t would be 108. But if each ticket is $108, then four tickets would be 432, which is way more than 112. So that's incorrect.

Option E: t over 4 equals 112; $28. So that's t/4=112, which would solve to t=448. But that's the same as option C, and it's wrong because the total would be too high. So E is incorrect.

Option F:4t -112=0; $448. So 4t=112, which would make t=28. Wait, but the solution here says $448. That's not right because 4*448 is 1792, which doesn't make sense. So F's solution is wrong.

Option G:4t=112; $448. Wait, same equation as B, but the solution is wrong here. 4t=112 leads to t=28, not 448. So G is incorrect.

Option H: t/112=4; $0.0357. That would mean t is 112*4=448, which again is way too high. So H is wrong.

Option I:112t=4; $44800. Solving for t gives t=4/112=0.0357, but that's like 3.5 cents, which doesn't make sense for a concert ticket. Also, the solution given is $44800, which is way off. So I is wrong.

Option J: t-4=112; $116. So t would be 116, meaning each ticket is $116. Four tickets would be 464, which is way more than 112. So J is incorrect.

So going back, the correct equation is 4t=112, which solves to t=28. That's option B. So the answer should be B.
</think>

The problem involves finding the cost of one concert ticket when the total cost for four tickets is $112. Letting \( t \) represent the cost of one ticket, the equation is:

\[
4t = 112
\]

Solving for \( t \), divide both sides by 4:

\[
t = \frac{112}{4} = 28
\]

Thus, the cost of one ticket is $28. Examining the options, the correct equation and solution are provided in **Option B: \( 4t = 112; \$28 \)**. All other options either have incorrect equations or incorrect solutions.
