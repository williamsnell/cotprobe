The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A witness sees a murder in the park and is called to testify in the criminal case. Can the defense attorney ask her on cross examination about her habit of feeding the pigeons? The defense knows that she was cited several times for illegally feeding the pigeons. Defense counsel tries to ask, "You have a longtime habit of feeding the pigeons, don't you? You have in fact been ticketed several times for feeding pigeons, haven't you, and yet you persisted in doing it, isn't that so?" Will the trial court likely allow the witness to be questioned on these matters?

Options:

A: Yes, because the statement indicates that the witness' attention was always focused on feeding the pigeons.
B: No, because the witness's actions outside of the crime scene have no bearing on their ability to testify.
C: Yes, because the defense has the right to question a witness about any topic.
D: No, because the defense is attempting to discredit the witness in an unrelated matter.
E: No, because a witness can never be asked about personal prior bad acts.
F: Yes, because the act of feeding pigeons could potentially distract the witness from accurately observing the events.
G: No, because the question has no probative value regarding the credibility of the witness or the guilt of the defendant.
H: Yes, because feeding pigeons in the park and persisting in it after being ticketed may show an antisocial trait of the witness.
I: Yes, because it demonstrates a pattern of breaking the law, which may affect the witness's credibility.

Okay, so I've got this question about evidence law, specifically dealing with cross-examination of a witness. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is a murder trial where a witness saw the crime in the park and is testifying. The defense attorney wants to ask her about her habit of feeding pigeons. They know she's been cited several times for this. The question they're trying to ask is about her habit and the fact that she kept doing it despite being ticketed.

The options are from A to I, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that in cross-examination, the defense can ask questions to challenge the witness's credibility. But there are rules about what they can ask. I think it's related to whether the questions are relevant and whether they're about character or specific acts.

So, the general rule is that a witness's character can be attacked, but only in specific ways. For example, if the witness has been convicted of a felony, that can be used to impeach their credibility. But I'm not sure about misdemeanors or just citations.

Wait, but feeding pigeons illegallyâ€”probably a minor offense, maybe a misdemeanor or even just an infraction. So if she's been cited, that's not a criminal conviction necessarily. But the defense is trying to bring up her habit.

I also recall that specific instances of conduct can be used to attack a witness's credibility if they're relevant. But the conduct has to relate to the witness's character for truthfulness or some other relevant trait.

So feeding pigeons... does that relate to her credibility? Maybe not directly. Unless it shows she's disobedient or something. But I'm not sure if that's a trait that's admissible.

Another point is whether the habit is relevant to her ability to observe the crime. If she's always feeding pigeons, maybe she's distracted and didn't see the murder clearly. But the question as phrased seems more about her persistence in feeding pigeons despite tickets, which might be trying to show she's stubborn or disregards rules.

Wait, the question is about cross-examining her on this. The possible reason for allowing it could be that it shows she's not a law-abiding citizen, which might affect her credibility. Or maybe it's just about her character.

But I think that unless the specific act is a crime that bears on truthfulness, it might not be admissible. For example, if she was convicted of perjury, that's directly relevant. But feeding pigeons... that's more about her compliance with rules, not her honesty.

So, the defense's question is probably trying to impeach her credibility by showing she's done something wrong before. But if it's not a crime of dishonesty, then it might not be allowed.

Wait, but some jurisdictions allow any felony conviction to impeach a witness, regardless of whether it's a crime of dishonesty. But I think for misdemeanors, it's only if it's a crime of dishonesty. And citations might not even be criminal convictions.

So in this case, the citations are for feeding pigeons. If it's a municipal ordinance, maybe it's not a criminal offense. So that wouldn't count as a conviction for impeachment purposes.

Alternatively, maybe the defense is trying to show that she's a habitual offender, but again, unless it's a crime that affects credibility, it might not be relevant.

Looking at the options:

Option A says yes because it shows she's focused on feeding pigeons. That's about her attention, so maybe relevant to her observation. But the question is about her habit and being ticketed.

Option B says no because it's unrelated to her testimony. That could be, but maybe it's relevant to her credibility.

Option D says no because it's trying to discredit her on an unrelated matter. That seems possible.

Option F says yes because feeding pigeons could distract her. So maybe it's about her ability to observe.

Option G says no because no probative value on credibility or guilt. That might be the case if feeding pigeons doesn't relate.

Option H says yes because it shows an antisocial trait. But I'm not sure if that's a valid ground.

Option I says yes because it shows a pattern of lawbreaking. But if it's not a crime, maybe not.

So, I'm trying to recall the rules. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, a witness's character for truthfulness can be attacked by specific instances of conduct, but those instances must be relevant and not extrinsic evidence. However, the specific instances can't be proved by extrinsic evidence; they can be asked on cross-examination.

Wait, but wait: the rule is that specific instances of a witness's conduct can be used to attack or support the witness's character for truthfulness, but they can't be used to prove a fact in issue. So, the defense can ask about specific acts that relate to the witness's truthfulness.

In this case, feeding pigeons and getting tickets isn't directly about truthfulness. It's more about law-abidingness. Unless the defense can argue that it shows she's prone to breaking rules, which could indicate a certain character.

But I'm not sure if that's enough. I think that unless the act is a crime of dishonesty, it's not admissible to impeach credibility. So, if she was cited for something like theft, that's different. But feeding pigeons... that's probably a minor regulation, not a crime of dishonesty.

So, the court would likely not allow the question because it doesn't relate to her credibility. Therefore, the correct answer would be that the court won't allow it.

Looking at the options again, option G says no because no probative value on credibility or guilt. That makes sense. Alternatively, option D says no because it's trying to discredit her on an unrelated matter.

Wait, but what's the reasoning for allowing or disallowing.

If the question is about her habit and the tickets, it's trying to show she's someone who disobeys rules, maybe implying she's not reliable. But I think that's not a proper way to impeach credibility. Her credibility can be attacked if she's a liar, but not just for being disobedient.

So the trial court would likely sustain an objection because the question is about an unrelated matter that doesn't affect her credibility.

So, options D and G are possibilities.

Option D says it's an attempt to discredit her on an unrelated matter. But maybe it's more about whether it's relevant to credibility.

Option G says it has no probative value regarding credibility or guilt. So the court would exclude it because it's irrelevant.

Alternatively, maybe the defense could argue that her habit shows she's often distracted by feeding pigeons, thus her observation of the crime was poor. That would relate to her perception. So, perhaps option F is possible.

But the way the question is phrased, it's more about her being cited and persisting, not about her attention during the crime.

So, I think the correct reason is that the information lacks probative value regarding her credibility. Therefore, the court would disallow it.

Looking back, option G says, "No, because the question has no probative value regarding the credibility of the witness or the guilt of the defendant." That sounds right.

So the answer is G.

The question revolves around whether a defense attorney can cross-examine a witness about her habit of feeding pigeons and being cited for it. The key issue is whether this line of questioning is relevant to the witness's credibility or the facts of the case.

Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, a witness's credibility can be challenged through specific instances of conduct, but those instances must be relevant to the witness's character for truthfulness or directly related to the case. Feeding pigeons, particularly when it results in citations, does not directly bear on the witness's honesty or truthfulness. While the defense might argue that it shows disregard for rules, this is not a recognized basis for impeaching credibility under evidence law. Additionally, the question does not appear to relate to the witness's ability to observe the crime, as it focuses on her persistence in feeding pigeons despite being cited, rather than her attention at the time of the murder.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** is incorrect because the question does not directly address the witness's attention or ability to observe the crime.
- **Option B** is incorrect because the witness's credibility can be challenged, but only through relevant and appropriate means.
- **Option C** is incorrect because the defense does not have unfettered rights to question a witness on any topic; questions must be relevant.
- **Option D** is plausible but less precise, as the focus should be on the lack of probative value rather than merely being unrelated.
- **Option E** is incorrect because witnesses can be asked about prior bad acts under certain conditions, but feeding pigeons does not qualify as a relevant or probative act.
- **Option F** is incorrect because the question does not specifically tie the habit of feeding pigeons to the witness's ability to observe the crime.
- **Option G** is correct because the question lacks probative value regarding the witness's credibility or the defendant's guilt.
- **Option H** is incorrect because feeding pigeons does not demonstrate a relevant antisocial trait for impeachment purposes.
- **Option I** is incorrect because feeding pigeons, even if it shows a pattern of lawbreaking, is not a crime of dishonesty and thus not admissible to impeach credibility.

The trial court is likely to disallow the question because it has no probative value regarding the witness's credibility or the defendant's guilt.
