Question:

Late one evening, a police department received a telephone call from an unidentified woman who reported hearing loud shrieks and screams from a neighboring home. The caller furnished the police with the address where the disturbance was taking place. When the police arrived at the home, they discovered the homeowner, bludgeoned to death. The murder weapon was a blood-stained baseball bat found near the victim's body. A subsequent investigation revealed that the homeowner had recently been separated from her husband who had since moved to another city. After questioning several of the victim's friends and relatives, the police concluded that the husband was a prime suspect in the murder. Thus, two detectives went to question the husband about the killing. When they arrived at his apartment, the detectives persuaded the landlord to let them into his apartment. Finding no one inside, they searched the apartment. Before leaving, the detectives took a box of cereal, which they planned to use for a fingerprint comparison. The prints from the cereal box matched those found on the baseball bat. The police provided the grand jury investigating the murder with the fingerprint comparison. The husband is subsequently subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury. Before his scheduled appearance, the husband files a motion to suppress evidence of the fingerprint comparison, contending that the evidence was illegally obtained. His motion should be

Options:

A: granted, because the cereal box was not in plain sight during the search.
B: denied, because the exclusionary rule has not been extended to grand jury hearings.
C: granted, because the grand jury is barred from considering illegally obtained evidence.
D: granted, because the warrantless search of the husband's apartment was unconstitutional.
E: denied, because the landlord gave the police permission to enter the apartment.
F: granted, because the police had no proof of the husband's involvement at the time of the search.
G: denied, because the fingerprint evidence was crucial to the investigation.
H: granted, because the police did not have the husband's consent to search his apartment.
I: denied, because the husband was not present during the search of his apartment.

Okay, let's tackle this multiple-choice question. It's a bit complex, but I'll try to break it down step by step. So, the scenario involves a murder investigation and some legal issues regarding evidence collection and suppression. 

First, the facts: The police received a call about a disturbance and found a woman bludgeoned to death. The weapon was a baseball bat with bloodstains. The investigation led them to suspect the victim's husband, who had recently separated and moved. They went to his apartment, got the landlord's permission to enter, searched the apartment when no one was there, and took a cereal box for fingerprints. The fingerprints matched those on the bat, so they used this evidence in the grand jury. The husband moves to suppress this evidence, claiming it was illegally obtained.

So the question is whether his motion should be granted or denied, and why.

Let me think about the legal issues here. The main issue seems to be the legality of the search and seizure of the cereal box. The detectives entered the apartment with the landlord's permission. Wait, but the landlord giving permission—does that make the search valid? I remember that a landlord can't give permission for the police to search a tenant's apartment without a warrant, except in certain circumstances, like if the landlord has common areas or joint access. But if the landlord lets them in, does that count as consent?

Wait, no. The general rule is that a landlord can't give consent for a search of the tenant's private areas. Because the tenant has a reasonable expectation of privacy in their rented space. So if the police entered without a warrant and without the tenant's consent, just the landlord's, that might be an unconstitutional search under the Fourth Amendment.

So the search here was warrantless, and the only consent was from the landlord. The husband wasn't present, so he didn't consent. So the search was likely unconstitutional. Therefore, any evidence obtained from that search—the cereal box and the fingerprints—would be subject to suppression under the exclusionary rule.

But wait, the exclusionary rule applies in criminal trials to exclude illegally obtained evidence. But here, the evidence is being used before a grand jury. Do the same rules apply? I think that the exclusionary rule generally applies to grand jury proceedings as well. So if the evidence was obtained illegally, it should be suppressed, even in the grand jury context.

Looking at the options now:

Option A: Granted because cereal box wasn't in plain sight. Hmm, plain view doctrine requires that the item be in plain view and that the officers have lawful access. But if the search was unlawful, then even if it's in plain view, it doesn't matter. So maybe this isn't the best reason.

Option B: Denied because exclusionary rule doesn't apply to grand juries. I thought it does apply. So B might be incorrect.

Option C: Granted because grand jury can't consider illegal evidence. That aligns with my earlier thought, so C could be correct.

Option D: Granted because the warrantless search was unconstitutional. That seems correct because the landlord's consent might not be sufficient. So D is also a possible answer.

Option E: Denied because landlord gave permission. But as I thought earlier, the landlord can't give consent for the tenant's private areas, so E is probably wrong.

Option F: Granted because no proof of husband's involvement. That's about probable cause, but even if they had probable cause, without a warrant or exigent circumstances, the search might still be illegal. So F could be a reason, but D seems more precise.

Option G: Denied because evidence was crucial. But materiality doesn't override Fourth Amendment violations, so G is wrong.

Option H: Granted because no consent from husband. This is similar to D. The search was without a warrant and without the husband's consent. So H is another possible correct answer.

Option I: Denied because husband wasn't present. Presence doesn't affect the legality of the search based on consent, so I is probably wrong.

Now, I'm trying to decide between options C, D, and H.

Option D says the warrantless search was unconstitutional. Option H says because police didn't have husband's consent. Both seem correct, but the key point is that the search without a warrant and without proper consent (since landlord can't consent) is unconstitutional. So D would be the reason.

Wait, but the reason for the motion is that the evidence was illegally obtained. So the main issue is the search's legality. The search was conducted without a warrant and without the tenant's consent. The landlord's consent is insufficient because the tenant has a reasonable expectation of privacy. Thus, the search violated the Fourth Amendment, making the evidence inadmissible.

So the motion to suppress should be granted because the search was unconstitutional. That points to option D.

Option C says the grand jury can't consider illegal evidence. Well, the grand jury can consider evidence, but if it's illegally obtained, it's excluded. So the motion would be granted on those grounds, but the reasoning in C is about the grand jury being barred, which is correct. So both C and D could be correct, but which one is the better answer.

Wait, the question is about the motion to suppress the evidence. The husband is arguing that the evidence was illegally obtained. So the issue is whether the evidence was obtained legally. If the search was unconstitutional (option D), then the evidence is suppressed. So D is about the search's constitutionality, which is the core issue.

Option C is about the grand jury's consideration, but the underlying reason is the evidence's illegality, which stems from the unconstitutional search.

So the correct answer should be D or C.

Wait, but the exclusionary rule applies in grand jury proceedings. So if the evidence was obtained illegally, it's excluded regardless of where it's used. So the motion should be granted because the evidence was obtained via an unconstitutional search, making option D correct.

Alternatively, option H says granted because no consent from husband. That's also correct because the police didn't have his consent and no warrant. So H and D are similar, but D is broader.

Wait, the more precise reason is that the search was warrantless and without consent. So D says the warrantless search was unconstitutional. That's accurate because warrantless searches are presumptively unreasonable unless exceptions apply (like consent, which here was invalid). So the search was unconstitutional, so D is correct.

Looking back at the options, option D seems to directly address the constitutional issue of the warrantless search.

So I think the correct answer is D.

The question revolves around the legality of a warrantless search and the admissibility of evidence obtained during that search in a grand jury proceeding. The police searched the husband's apartment with the landlord's consent but without a warrant or the husband's permission. The key legal issue is whether the landlord's consent was sufficient to justify the search under the Fourth Amendment.

The Fourth Amendment protects against unreasonable searches and seizures, and a warrantless search is presumptively unreasonable unless an exception applies, such as valid consent. However, a landlord cannot provide consent for the police to search a tenant's private living space because the tenant has a reasonable expectation of privacy. Therefore, the search was unconstitutional, as the police lacked a warrant and the landlord's consent was insufficient.

The husband moved to suppress the evidence, arguing it was illegally obtained. The exclusionary rule applies to grand jury proceedings, meaning evidence obtained through an unconstitutional search is inadmissible. While multiple options address aspects of the issue, the most precise reason for granting the motion is that the warrantless search was unconstitutional.

- **Option A** is incorrect because the plain view doctrine does not apply if the search itself was unlawful.
- **Option B** is incorrect because the exclusionary rule does apply to grand jury proceedings.
- **Option C** is correct in stating that the grand jury cannot consider illegally obtained evidence, but it does not address the underlying reason for the illegality.
- **Option D** is correct because it directly addresses the unconstitutional nature of the warrantless search.
- **Option E** is incorrect because the landlord's consent is insufficient to justify the search of the tenant's private space.
- **Option F** is incorrect because the lack of probable cause at the time of the search is not the primary issue; the issue is the unconstitutional search itself.
- **Option G** is incorrect because the importance of the evidence does not override Fourth Amendment protections.
- **Option H** is correct in noting the lack of the husband's consent, but it is less precise than Option D.
- **Option I** is incorrect because the husband's presence is irrelevant to the legality of the search.

The best answer is **Option D**, as it directly addresses the unconstitutional nature of the warrantless search, which is the core issue in this case.

D
