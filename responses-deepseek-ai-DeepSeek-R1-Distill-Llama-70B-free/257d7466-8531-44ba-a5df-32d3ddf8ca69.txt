Okay, so I have this problem here about calculating the compound annual rate of return over three years. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The returns given are for three consecutive years: 2.45% in 2018, 5.42% in 2019, and -13.83% in 2020. I remember that compound annual growth rate (CAGR) is the rate that, when compounded over the years, gives the same final value as the actual returns each year.

So the formula for CAGR is: 

Final Value = Initial Value × (1 + r)^n

Where r is the CAGR and n is the number of years. But wait, in this case, each year has a different return, so I should adjust each year's return accordingly.

Let me think: the formula can be rearranged to solve for r. Since each year's return is (1 + return), the overall growth factor is the product of each year's (1 + return). Then take the nth root and subtract 1.

So the steps would be:

1. Convert each percentage return to a decimal. That means dividing each by 100. So for 2018, it's 0.0245, 2019 is 0.0542, and 2020 is -0.1383.

2. Add 1 to each of these to get the growth factors. So 1.0245, 1.0542, and 0.8617 (since -0.1383 +1 is 0.8617).

3. Multiply these three factors together to get the total growth over the three years. Let me compute that:

1.0245 × 1.0542 = Let's see, 1.0245 * 1.0542. 

Hmm, 1.0245 * 1.05 is about 1.0757, but I need to be more precise. Let me calculate it step by step.

Alternatively, I can use a calculator in my mind. Wait, maybe I should think of it as (1.0245) × (1.0542). Let's compute 1.0245 * 1.0542.

First, multiply 1.0245 * 1 = 1.0245. Then 1.0245 * 0.05 = 0.051225. Then 1.0245 * 0.0042 = approximately 0.0043097. Adding these up: 1.0245 + 0.051225 = 1.075725, plus 0.0043097 is about 1.080035. Wait, but that's for 1.0245*(1 + 0.0542), which is the first two years. Then multiply by the third year's factor, 0.8617.

So 1.080035 * 0.8617.

Let me compute that. 1.08 * 0.86 is 0.9288. But let's be more precise. 1.080035 × 0.8617.

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to compute 1.080035 * 0.8 = 0.864028, and 1.080035 * 0.0617 = let's see, 1.080035 * 0.06 is 0.0648021, and 1.080035 *0.0017 is approximately 0.00183606. So adding those: 0.0648021 +0.00183606≈0.066638. Then total is 0.864028 + 0.066638= 0.930666.

Wait, but 0.8617 is 0.8 + 0.06 + 0.0017. So that's correct. So the total growth factor after three years is approximately 0.930666...

But wait, let me double-check the multiplication because approximations can lead to errors. Let me compute it more accurately.

1.0245 × 1.0542 = ?

Let me compute 1.0245 * 1.0542:

Breaking it down:

1.0245 * 1 = 1.0245.

1.0245 * 0.05 = 0.051225.

1.0245 * 0.0042 = 0.0043097.

Adding them all: 1.0245 + 0.051225 = 1.075725; plus 0.0043097 = 1.0800347.

So that's 1.0800347 after two years. Now multiply by 0.8617.

So 1.0800347 × 0.8617.

Let me compute this precisely. Let's do 1.0800347 × 0.8617.

Break it down:

1.0800347 × 0.8 = 0.864028.

1.0800347 × 0.06 = 0.064802.

1.0800347 × 0.0017 = approx 0.00183606.

Adding all together: 0.864028 + 0.064802 = 0.928830, plus 0.00183606 = 0.930666.

So the total growth factor is approximately 0.930666. So over three years, each dollar becomes 0.930666 dollars. Wait, but that's a decrease, which makes sense because one year was negative.

Now, this is the total growth factor. To find the CAGR, we take the geometric mean. So the formula is:

CAGR = (Total Growth Factor)^(1/n) - 1.

Here, n=3.

So, the total growth factor is 0.930666, which is (1 + r)^3.

So we take the cube root of 0.930666 and subtract 1.

Hmm, what's the cube root of 0.930666?

I remember that cube root of 1 is 1. Cube of 0.98 is approximately 0.98^3 = around 0.941192. Wait, 0.98^3= (0.98)*(0.98)=0.9604, then *0.98 → 0.941192. So 0.98^3 ≈ 0.941192.

Our total is 0.930666, which is lower than 0.941192, so the cube root is lower than 0.98. Let's try 0.97. 0.97^3 is 0.912673. That's lower than 0.930666. So the cube root is between 0.97 and 0.98.

Wait, but wait, let me get a better approximation.

Let me think of it as:

Let x = (0.930666)^(1/3).

We can use logarithms or approximation.

Alternatively, think in terms of x^3 = 0.930666.

I can use linear approximation. Let me take f(x) = x^3 around x=0.97.

Wait, 0.97^3= 0.912673.

0.98^3=0.941192.

Wait, 0.97^3=0.912673, 0.98^3=0.941192. Our target is 0.930666.

So between 0.97 and 0.98, the function x^3 increases from 0.912673 to 0.941192 as x goes from 0.97 to 0.98.

We need x such that x^3 = 0.930666.

The difference between target and 0.97^3 is 0.930666 - 0.912673 = 0.017993.

The range between 0.97 and 0.98 in x^3 is 0.941192 - 0.912673 = 0.028519.

So the fraction is 0.017993 / 0.028519 ≈ 0.63 (approximately 0.63). So x is approximately 0.97 + 0.63*(0.98-0.97) = 0.97 + 0.0063= 0.9763.

So x≈0.9763. Therefore, the cube root is approximately 0.9763.

So (0.930666)^(1/3) ≈ 0.9763.

Therefore, CAGR is 0.9763 - 1 = -0.0237.

Wait, that's a negative number. So approximately -2.37%.

Looking at the options, let me see. Option E is -0.023669, which is approximately -2.3669%. That's very close to my calculation.

Wait, but wait—maybe I should compute it more accurately because my approximation might be a bit off.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate it more precisely using logarithms.

The formula for CAGR is [(1 + r1)(1 + r2)(1 + r3)]^(1/3) - 1.

Which is [(1.0245)(1.0542)(0.8617)]^(1/3) - 1.

Let me compute the product again more accurately.

1.0245 × 1.0542 = ?

Let me compute 1.0245 * 1.0542.

1.0245 * 1 = 1.0245.

1.0245 * 0.05 = 0.051225.

1.0245 * 0.0042 = 0.0043097.

Adding these gives 1.0245 + 0.051225 = 1.075725, plus 0.0043097 is 1.0800347.

Now multiply by 0.8617.

1.0800347 × 0.8617.

Let me compute this step by step.

1.0800347 × 0.8 = 0.864028.

1.0800347 × 0.06 = 0.064802.

1.0800347 × 0.0017 = approx 0.00183606.

Adding them: 0.864028 + 0.064802 = 0.928830, plus 0.00183606 = 0.93066606.

So product is 0.93066606.

Now, to find the cube root. Let's compute (0.930666)^(1/3).

Another approach is to compute the natural logarithm of 0.930666, divide by 3, then exponentiate.

ln(0.930666) = approx ?

I know that ln(1) =0, ln(0.9)= approx -0.10536, ln(0.95)= approx -0.051293.

Wait, wait, better to use a calculator-like approach.

ln(0.930666):

Let me compute it using the Taylor series or a known value.

I know that ln(0.93)= Let me recall: ln(0.93) is approximately -0.0729. Let me check with a calculator in mind:

e^(-0.07) is about 0.9324, which is higher than 0.930666. Wait, e^(-0.072)= Let's compute e^(-0.07) ≈ 0.9324. e^(-0.072)= ?

The actual value: ln(0.930666) ≈ let's compute it.

Alternatively, I can use the approximation:

ln(a*b) = ln a + ln b, but perhaps that's not helpful here.

Alternatively, using the formula for small x, ln(1+x) ≈ x - x^2/2 + x^3/3...

But 0.930666 is 1 - 0.069334.

So, x = -0.069334.

So ln(1 + x) ≈ x - x²/2 + x³/3 - x^4/4...

So x = -0.069334.

x² = (0.069334)^2 ≈ 0.004806.

x³ ≈ (-0.069334)^3 ≈ -0.000333.

x^4 ≈ (0.069334)^4 ≈ 0.000023.

So ln(0.930666) ≈ (-0.069334) - (0.004806)/2 + (-0.000333)/3 - (0.000023)/4.

Compute each term:

First term: -0.069334.

Second term: - (0.004806)/2 = -0.002403.

Third term: -0.000333 /3 ≈ -0.000111.

Fourth term: -0.000023 /4 ≈ -0.00000575.

Adding all together:

-0.069334 -0.002403 = -0.071737.

-0.071737 -0.000111 = -0.071848.

-0.071848 - 0.00000575 ≈ -0.071854.

But wait, I think higher-order terms may contribute a little. Let's compute the next term: x^5/5.

x^5 = (0.069334)^5 ≈  approx (0.069334)^2=0.004806, then cubed is 0.004806 *0.069334≈ 0.000333, then squared is 0.000333*0.069334≈ 0.000023, then multiplied by 0.069334 gives ≈ 0.0000016. So x^5 ≈ 0.0000016, and divided by 5: 0.00000032.

So adding this term: + 0.00000032.

So total ln ≈ -0.071854 + 0.00000032 ≈ -0.0718537.

Wait, but perhaps this is an underestimate. Because the Taylor series alternates, and we're truncating. The actual ln(0.930666) is approximately -0.0719.

Now, taking that value, divide by 3:

ln(0.930666)/3 ≈ (-0.0719)/3 ≈ -0.0239667.

Now, exponentiate this to get the cube root:

e^(-0.0239667) ≈ ?

e^-0.02 is approximately 0.980199.

e^-0.0239667 is a bit lower. Let's compute using the Taylor series around x=0.02.

Let me find e^x where x = -0.0239667.

Alternatively, I can use the approximation e^x ≈ 1 + x + x²/2 + x^3/6.

x = -0.0239667

x² = (0.0239667)^2 ≈ 0.0005745.

x³ = x² * x ≈ 0.0005745 * (-0.0239667) ≈ -0.00001377.

So e^x ≈ 1 + (-0.0239667) + (0.0005745)/2 + (-0.00001377)/6.

Compute each term:

1) 1.

2) -0.0239667.

3) 0.0005745 /2 = 0.00028725.

4) (-0.00001377)/6 ≈ -0.000002295.

Adding them all together:

1 - 0.0239667 = 0.9760333.

0.9760333 + 0.00028725 = 0.97632055.

0.97632055 - 0.000002295 ≈ 0.97631826.

So e^(-0.0239667) ≈ 0.976318.

So the cube root of 0.930666 is approximately 0.976318.

Therefore, the CAGR is 0.976318 - 1 = -0.023682, which is approximately -0.023682, or -2.3682%.

Looking at the options, option E is -0.023669, which is very close. That must be the correct answer.
</think>

To calculate the compound annual rate of return (CAGR) over the three years, we use the formula:

\[
\text{CAGR} = \left( (1 + r_1)(1 + r_2)(1 + r_3) \right)^{\frac{1}{n}} - 1
\]

### Step 1: Convert percentage returns to decimals
The returns for the three years are:
- 2018: \( r_1 = 2.45\% = 0.0245 \)
- 2019: \( r_2 = 5.42\% = 0.0542 \)
- 2020: \( r_3 = -13.83\% = -0.1383 \)

### Step 2: Calculate growth factors
Add 1 to each return to get the growth factors:
- \( 1 + r_1 = 1.0245 \)
- \( 1 + r_2 = 1.0542 \)
- \( 1 + r_3 = 0.8617 \)

### Step 3: Compute the total growth factor
Multiply the growth factors together:
\[
\text{Total Growth Factor} = (1.0245)(1.0542)(0.8617)
\]

First, calculate \( 1.0245 \times 1.0542 \):
\[
1.0245 \times 1.0542 = 1.0800347
\]

Next, multiply by \( 0.8617 \):
\[
1.0800347 \times 0.8617 = 0.930666
\]

Thus, the total growth factor over three years is approximately \( 0.930666 \).

### Step 4: Calculate the CAGR
The CAGR is found by taking the cube root of the total growth factor and subtracting 1:
\[
\text{CAGR} = (0.930666)^{\frac{1}{3}} - 1
\]

Using approximations or logarithmic calculations, the cube root of \( 0.930666 \) is approximately \( 0.976318 \). Therefore:
\[
\text{CAGR} = 0.976318 - 1 = -0.023682
\]

This corresponds to a compound annual rate of return of approximately \( -0.023682 \), or \( -2.3682\% \).

### Step 5: Match with the closest option
The closest option to \( -0.023682 \) is \( -0.023669 \), which corresponds to **Option E**.

ANSWER: E
