Okay, so I've got this question about electric dipoles and the electric field strength at the midpoint. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

Alright, the setup: there's an electric dipole with two equal but opposite charges. Each has a magnitude of 4.0 nC. They're separated by 2.0 cm. The question is asking for the electric field strength at the point exactly midway between them.

I remember that an electric dipole consists of two charges, +q and -q, separated by some distance d. The electric field at different points around a dipole depends on where you're measuring it. At the midpoint, I think the fields from each charge might cancel each other out because they're equal and opposite? Or wait, maybe not. Wait, no—because the direction of each field might be the same. Let me visualize this.

So the charges are at two points, say +q on the left and -q on the right, separated by 2 cm. The midpoint is exactly in the middle, 1 cm from each charge.

At that midpoint, the positive charge will create an electric field pointing towards the right (since field lines go from + to -), and the negative charge will create a field pointing towards the left (since field lines go towards - charges). But wait, wait, no—wait. The positive charge emits field lines outward, so from +q, the field at the midpoint points away, which would be to the right. The negative charge, -q, attracts field lines, so the field at the midpoint would point towards the charge, which is to the left.

Wait, no, wait. Let me get this straight. At the midpoint, the positive charge is on the left. The field direction from +q at the midpoint is to the right (since field lines go away from positive). The negative charge is on the right of the midpoint. The field from -q at the midpoint would be pointing to the left because field lines go towards negative charges. So the two fields are in opposite directions.

Wait, no, wait again. No, wait, the positive charge is on the left, so the field at the midpoint due to +q is pointing to the right. The negative charge is on the right, so the field due to -q at the midpoint is pointing to the left. So the two fields are opposite in direction. But since the charges are equal in magnitude, the fields would be equal in magnitude, right? So the net field would be zero.

Wait, but wait a second. The distance from each charge to the midpoint is the same, so each field would have the same magnitude but opposite directions. So they would cancel each other out. That would make the electric field at the midpoint zero. So the answer would be D: 0.

But wait, another thought. Wait, no—wait, the electric field from each charge is calculated using E = kq / r². Since the distance r is the same for both charges (1 cm or 0.01 m), then the magnitudes of the fields are the same. But the directions are opposite. So E_total = E_+ + E_- = E (right) + E (left). But since they are opposite, they subtract. Since E_+ and E_- are the same in magnitude, their sum is zero. So yeah, the field is zero.

So looking at the options, D is zero. So the answer should be D.

The electric dipole consists of two equal but opposite charges, each with a magnitude of \( 4.0 \, \text{nC} \), separated by a distance of \( 2.0 \, \text{cm} \). The question asks for the electric field strength at the midpoint between the charges.

At the midpoint, the electric field due to the positive charge (\(+q\)) points to the right (away from the positive charge), while the electric field due to the negative charge (\(-q\)) points to the left (toward the negative charge). Since the charges are equal in magnitude and the distance from each charge to the midpoint is the same (\( 1.0 \, \text{cm} \)), the magnitudes of the electric fields produced by each charge are equal. However, the fields point in opposite directions. Therefore, the net electric field at the midpoint is the sum of these two fields, which cancel each other out.

Thus, the electric field strength at the midpoint is \( 0 \).

Answer: D
