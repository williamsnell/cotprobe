Okay, so I've got this question about Hobbes and what he defines as injustice. I'm a bit rusty on my philosophy, but let's see if I can work through this. 

First, I remember that Thomas Hobbes was a big name in political philosophy, especially with his work "Leviathan." He talked a lot about the state of nature and social contracts. From what I recall, Hobbes believed that without a strong central authority, life would be "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short." So people come together and form a covenant, agreeing to obey a sovereign to maintain order.

Now, the question is about injustice. I think Hobbes had specific ideas about what constitutes injustice. Injustice isn't just any bad behavior; it's more about breaking the rules that people have agreed upon. So, in his view, injustice would relate to failing to uphold one's part of the covenant or breaking the laws that have been established.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Not adhering to societal norms. Hmm, societal norms can vary, and I'm not sure if Hobbes tied injustice directly to that. He was more about contracts and laws than general societal expectations.

Option B: Being dishonest in any situation. Dishonesty is a broad term. While lying might be wrong, I don't think Hobbes defined injustice solely based on dishonesty.

Option C: Failure to perform one’s covenant. This rings a bell. The social contract is a covenant, so failing to perform it would mean breaking the agreement, which Hobbes would see as injustice.

Option D: Treating another person as a mere means. That sounds more like Kant's philosophy, where using people as a means rather than an end is wrong. Not Hobbes.

Option E: Manipulating others for personal gain. Manipulation is a type of dishonesty or exploitation, but again, Hobbes's focus was more on the covenant and laws.

Option F: Behaving immorally. Morality is a broad concept, and Hobbes's views were more tied to the laws and covenants than general morality.

Option G: Violating a law of nature. Wait, Hobbes did talk about the laws of nature, which are like moral precepts. But I think his definition of injustice is more specific to the covenant rather than any law of nature.

Option H: Disregarding the rights of others. Rights are important, but I'm not sure if this is the exact definition Hobbes used. It feels a bit more like Locke's ideas.

Option I: Taking more than one’s share of a good. That sounds like distributive justice, but I don't recall Hobbes focusing on this as the definition of injustice.

Option J: Acting against the will of the sovereign. Hobbes did emphasize the role of the sovereign, but injustice would be more about breaking the covenant, not just disobeying the sovereign's will.

So putting it all together, the most accurate answer seems to be Option C: failure to perform one’s covenant. Because Hobbes's view of injustice is tied to breaking the agreements that people have made to establish order and avoid the state of nature.

The question asks about Hobbes's definition of injustice. Hobbes, in his work "Leviathan," emphasizes the importance of covenants and social contracts to maintain order and avoid the state of nature. Injustice, according to Hobbes, is specifically tied to the failure to uphold one's part of the covenant. This is because the covenant is the foundation of the social order, and breaking it undermines the agreed-upon rules necessary for society to function.

Analyzing the options:

- **A** and **B** are too broad and not specific to Hobbes's focus on covenants.
- **C** aligns with Hobbes's emphasis on the failure to perform one’s covenant as the essence of injustice.
- **D**, **E**, **F**, **H**, **I**, and **J** either relate to other philosophers or broader concepts not central to Hobbes's definition.
- **G** refers to the laws of nature, which are relevant but not the specific definition of injustice.

Thus, the correct answer is **C: failure to perform one’s covenant**.

Answer: C
