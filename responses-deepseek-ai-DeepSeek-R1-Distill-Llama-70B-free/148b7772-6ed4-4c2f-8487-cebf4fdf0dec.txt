Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what personal (ratione personae) immunity is. I remember that immunity can be a bit tricky because there are different types, like state immunity and diplomatic immunity. But this question is specifically about personal immunity, so I need to focus on that.

From what I recall, immunity in law often protects certain individuals from being sued or prosecuted. There's something about the differences between immunity that applies to the state as a whole and immunity that applies to a person's role or position.

I think personal immunity, ratione personae, is tied to the person's office or position. So it's not about the nature of the act they did, but rather who they are. For example, heads of state might have personal immunity because of their position, regardless of whether they were acting in a public or private capacity.

Looking at the options:

Option A says personal immunity is for private conduct, not public. Wait, that doesn't sound right because I thought personal immunity covers actions taken in their official capacity, which would be public. So maybe A is wrong.

Option B says it's for all physical persons, but that can't be right because not everyone has immunity. Only certain officials do.

Option C says it's for all State officials, no matter their conduct. Hmm, but I think even State officials might lose immunity if they commit certain serious crimes, like war crimes. So C might be too broad.

Option D mentions crimes in public capacity, but the immunity is about the person, not the conduct. So D might be mixing things up.

Option E says it's only for particular persons, regardless of whether the conduct was public or private. Wait, personal immunity is usually for their official acts, so maybe this is about when they're acting in their personal capacity. Or is it the opposite?

Option F says it's for all individuals, which again seems too broad. Immunity isn't universal.

Option G says personal immunity is in a personal capacity and doesn't cover state conduct. I'm a bit confused. Personal immunity is about the person's role, so maybe G is correct in that it's personal, not covering the state's actions.

Option H says it's for state officials for public conduct. That sounds like it could be correct because personal immunity is often for official acts.

Option I says it's for private capacity, which makes me think that personal immunity applies when they're acting privately, but I'm not sure. Maybe when officials do something in their personal time, they don't have immunity. So perhaps personal immunity is for their public acts, making I incorrect.

Option J says it's for particular persons if their conduct was public. So that aligns with the idea that personal immunity applies to officials for their public conduct.

Wait, now I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. Personal immunity, ratione personae, is typically about the person's status, not the nature of their actions. So it's not about whether the act was public or private, but whether the person holds a position that grants them immunity. For example, a head of state might have immunity regardless of whether their actions were public or private. 

So looking at the options again, option E says it's for particular persons regardless of the conduct's public or private nature. That sounds right. Because personal immunity is based on who they are, not what they did.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes, immunity is split into types. There's immunity ratione materiae, which is based on the nature of the act (like official duties), and immunity ratione personae, which is based on the person's position. So personal immunity (ratione personae) would apply to certain officials no matter what they do, in their official or even private capacity.

So looking at the options, E says it's afforded to particular persons regardless of whether the conduct was public or private. So that fits. Alternatively, option J says it's only for public conduct, which would be more like ratione materiae.

Wait, another angle: Personal immunity is often absolute and covers all acts, public or private, because it's tied to the person's role. So E would be correct because it's given irrespective of the conduct's nature.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option E: Personal immunity is afforded only to particular persons irrespective if their conduct was undertaken in a private or public capacity.

Yes, that seems to fit. Because it's about the person's role, not the act. So E is the correct answer.

Personal (ratione personae) immunity is a type of immunity that is based on the status or position of the individual rather than the nature of their conduct. It is typically afforded to certain high-ranking officials, such as heads of state, regardless of whether their actions were undertaken in a public or private capacity. This form of immunity is distinct from immunity ratione materiae, which is based on the nature of the act (e.g., official duties) and does not necessarily extend to private conduct.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** is incorrect because personal immunity is not limited to private conduct; it can apply to both public and private acts.
- **Option B** is incorrect because personal immunity is not granted to all physical persons, only to specific individuals based on their position.
- **Option C** is incorrect because personal immunity is not automatically granted to all State officials, and it may have exceptions for certain serious crimes.
- **Option D** is incorrect because personal immunity is not solely for crimes committed in a public capacity; it applies regardless of the nature of the conduct.
- **Option E** is correct because personal immunity is afforded to particular persons (e.g., heads of state) irrespective of whether their conduct was public or private.
- **Option F** is incorrect because personal immunity is not granted to all individuals.
- **Option G** is misleading because personal immunity is tied to the individual's role, not just their personal capacity.
- **Option H** is incorrect because personal immunity is not strictly limited to public conduct.
- **Option I** is incorrect because personal immunity is not specifically for private conduct.
- **Option J** is incorrect because personal immunity is not contingent on the conduct being public.

The correct answer is **E**, as it accurately reflects that personal immunity is afforded to particular persons based on their position, regardless of whether their conduct was public or private.
