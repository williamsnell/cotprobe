Question:

What are some of the cues used by animal in migrating?

Options:

A: Animals use the temperature changes as cues.
B: Animals use the color of the surroundings as cues.
C: Animals use the noises from the environment as cues.
D: Animals navigate by following other migrating animal species exclusively.
E: Animals rely solely on the memory of previous migration paths.
F: Animals use the taste of the local vegetation as a primary cue.
G: Animals depend on the guidance of human-made structures for migration.
H: Animals use the phase of the moon as the sole cue for migration.
I: Animals exclusively use the position of the sun at noon for migration.
J: Animals use several cues in their migrations such as scent, celestial cues, and the earth's magnetic field.

Okay, so I've got this question about animal migration cues. Hmm, I remember that animals use various cues to navigate during migration. Let me think about what I've learned before.

The question is asking what cues animals use. The options are from A to J. I need to pick the correct ones.

Option A says they use temperature changes. I think I've heard that some animals might respond to temperature, like birds migrating when it gets colder. So A could be a possibility, but I'm not sure if it's the only cue.

Option B is color of surroundings. I'm not so sure about this. Maybe some, like monarch butterflies, use visual cues, but I don't think it's a primary one for most animals. Not sure if B is correct.

Option C is noises. I think some animals, like birds, might use auditory cues, such as calls or environmental sounds. But again, is that the main cue? Not certain.

Option D says they follow other migrating species exclusively. That doesn't sound right. I mean, maybe some learn from others, but 'exclusively' seems too strong. Probably not D.

Option E is relying solely on memory. Some animals, like experienced birds, might remember their paths, but I don't think they rely solely on memory. It's probably one of several cues. So E is likely incorrect.

Option F is taste of vegetation. I don't recall hearing that taste is a primary cue for migration. Maybe some animals use it to find food, but not for navigating during migration. So probably F isn't right.

Option G is human-made structures. I don't think animals depend on that. Maybe some might adapt, but it's not a primary cue. So G is probably wrong.

Option H is the phase of the moon as the sole cue. I know some marine animals, like turtles, might use the moon, but I don't think it's the only cue. So H is incorrect.

Option I says they use the sun's position at noon exclusively. I remember that celestial navigation is a thing, like birds using the sun and stars. But 'exclusively' the sun at noon? That seems too restrictive. They probably use multiple celestial cues, not just the sun at noon. So I is probably wrong.

Option J states that animals use several cues like scent, celestial, and Earth's magnetic field. Oh right! I remember that animals use a combination of cues. For example, birds might use the Earth's magnetic field as a primary cue, along with the position of the sun and stars. Some might use scent to find their way. So J sounds correct because it mentions multiple cues.

Looking back at the options, the question is asking what are some cues, so it's possible that multiple options could be correct, but the correct answer is the one that mentions several cues. So J is the right choice.

Animals use a variety of cues for migration, often relying on multiple factors rather than a single one. Among the options provided, the most accurate answer is that animals use several cues such as scent, celestial cues, and the Earth's magnetic field. This aligns with the understanding that migration strategies typically involve a combination of different navigational aids. 

Answer: J
