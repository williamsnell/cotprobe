Okay, so I've got this economics question in front of me, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking. It's about how productive resources are allocated in the Soviet economy and how that differs from a market-based allocation. The options are from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that the Soviet economy was a centrally planned economy. So, I think that means a central authority makes most of the decisions about resource allocation. In contrast, market economies rely on supply and demand, where businesses and consumers make decisions based on prices and market signals.

So, the question is asking about the allocation methods. In the Soviet system, I believe it's a central planning committee, like Gosplan or something similar, that decides where resources go. They set production targets and allocate resources accordingly. This is different from a market economy, where resources are allocated based on market forcesâ€”supply and demand, prices, competition, etc.

Let me look at the options. Option H says that a central planning committee allocates resources in the Soviet economy, while supply and demand dictate allocation in a market economy. That sounds right. Let me double-check the other options to make sure.

Option A: Market economy resources are allocated randomly. No, that's not correct. Market allocation is based on supply and demand, not random.

Option B: Soviet government invests in sectors with high returns. Well, maybe, but that's not the main point. The key is who makes the decisions, not just the sectors they choose.

Option C: Gosbank allocates resources; market based on expected returns. Gosbank was the Soviet bank, but the allocation was more about central planning by a committee, not just the bank. So maybe not the best answer.

Option D: Local governments in Soviet, international bodies in market. No, that's the opposite. The Soviet was very centralized, not local, and market economies don't have international bodies dictating allocation.

Option E: Equal distribution among industries in Soviet. I don't think so. They focused on heavy industry and other prioritized sectors, not equal distribution.

Option F: Market economy has a single body. No, that's the Soviet model, not the market. Market is decentralized.

Option G: Consumer votes in Soviet, producers decide in market. I don't recall the Soviet system using consumer votes for allocation. It was more top-down.

Option I: Lottery in Soviet, competitive bidding in market. No, the Soviet didn't use a lottery. It was planned.

Option J: Public allocation in Soviet. Not exactly; it was the central planners, not the general public.

So, Option H seems to correctly describe both systems. The Soviet uses a central planning committee, and the market uses supply and demand.

The correct answer is H. In the Soviet economy, resources were allocated by a central planning committee, whereas in a market economy, allocation is determined by supply and demand.
