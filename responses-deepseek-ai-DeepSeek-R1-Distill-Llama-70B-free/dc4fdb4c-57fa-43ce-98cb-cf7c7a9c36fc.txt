Okay, so I've got this finance problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the problem again.

Mr. Simmons has two investment options: he can buy a 6(1/4)%, $1,000 bond at 98, or buy 10 shares of 6% preferred stock with a par value of $100 each, bought at 101. The question is which investment gives a greater effective yield and by how much. The options are provided, and I need to choose the correct one.

Hmm, effective yield usually refers to the annual yield an investor gets from an investment, taking into account the purchase price and the income from it. I think for bonds, it's the yield to maturity, and for preferred stock, it's the dividend yield adjusted for the purchase price.

Wait, let's clarify. The bond is a 6.25% bond (since 6 1/4 is 6.25%) with a par value of $1000, bought at 98. So he's paying $980 for a bond that pays $62.50 annually (6.25% of $1000 is 62.5). But wait, I think the bond's price is 98, which is 98% of par. So 98% of $1000 is $980. So the annual interest is 6.25% of $1000, which is $62.50.

The preferred stock is 6% with par $100, but he's buying each share at 101. So each share costs $101, and he buys 10 shares, so total investment is 10 * 101 = $1010. The dividend is 6% of par, so 6% of $100 is $6 per share. For 10 shares, that's 10 * $6 = $60 per year.

Now, to find the effective yield for each investment. I think the effective yield is calculated as (annual income / total investment) * 100 to get the percentage.

For the bond:
Annual income is $62.50.
Total investment is $980.
So yield is (62.50 / 980) * 100.

Let me compute that: 62.50 divided by 980. Let's see, 62.5 / 980. Let me approximate this. 980 is 1000-20. 62.5 / 980 ≈ 0.06377 or 6.377%. So that's about 6.38% when rounded to the nearest tenth.

For the preferred stock:
Annual income is $60.
Total investment is $1010.
So yield is (60 / 1010) * 100.

Calculating that: 60 / 1010. Let's see, 60 divided by 1010. Let me compute this: 1010 is approximately 1000, so 60/1000 is 0.06, but since 1010 is a bit more than 1000, the value will be a little less than 0.06. Let me do the exact division: 60 ÷ 1010.

Let me compute this: 1010 goes into 60 zero times. Add a decimal point, make it 600 ÷ 1010, which is approximately 0.0594 (since 1010 * 0.0594 ≈ 60). So 0.0594 * 100 is 5.94%, which is approximately 5.9% when rounded to the nearest tenth.

Wait, but wait a second. Alternatively, perhaps the effective yield for the bond is calculated differently. Because bonds can have different yield calculations, like current yield vs yield to maturity. Oh, right, but in this case, since it's about effective yield, I think current yield is what's being considered here, which is the annual interest divided by the purchase price.

So for the bond: 62.50 / 980 = approx 6.38%, and for the stock, 60 / 1010 ≈ 5.94%. Therefore, the bond yields higher.

So the bond's effective yield is about 6.38%, and the preferred stock is about 5.94%. The difference is approximately 0.44%. Wait, but let me compute more accurately.

Let me do more precise calculations.

Bond:
62.50 / 980 = ?

Let me calculate 62.5 ÷ 980.

Well, 980 × 0.063 = ?

0.063 * 980 = 61.74. That's less than 62.5.

0.064 × 980 = 62.72, which is more than 62.5. So the actual value is between 0.063 and 0.064.

The difference between 0.063 and 0.064 is 0.001, which is 1%. So, 62.5 is 62.5 - 61.74 = 0.76 above 0.063.

The range between 0.063 and 0.064 is 980 * 0.001 = 0.98.

So 0.76 / 0.98 ≈ 0.775 of the way from 0.063 to 0.064. So approximately 0.063775, which is 6.3775%, so 6.38% when rounded to the nearest tenth.

Preferred stock:

60 / 1010 = ?

60 ÷ 1010.

Let me compute 60 ÷ 1010.

60 ÷ 1000 is 0.06.

60 ÷ 1010 is 0.059405 approximately. So that's 5.9405%, which is approximately 5.9% when rounded to the nearest tenth.

Wait, but the question says to round to the nearest (1/10)%, which is one decimal place. So 6.3775% becomes 6.4% when rounded to one decimal place? Wait, no. Wait, 6.3775% is 6.3775. The first decimal is 3, the second is 7, which is >=5, so it rounds up to 6.4%.

Wait, no, wait. 6.3775% is 6.3775. The question is to compute to the nearest tenth of a percent. So 6.3775 is approximately 6.38%, which when rounded to one decimal place would be 6.4% because the next digit is 7, which is 5 or higher, so you round up. Wait, 6.3775 is 6.3775%. The first decimal is 3, second is 7, third is 7. So when rounding to one decimal, you look at the second decimal. 3 is the first, 7 is the second. Since 7 >=5, you round the 3 up to 4, so 6.4%.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again: 6.3775 is 6.3775. If you're rounding to one decimal place, you look at the second decimal place. So the number is 6.3 (first decimal) and then 7 (second decimal). So 6.3 + 0.07 (approx). So when rounding 6.3775 to one decimal place, it's 6.4% because the second decimal is 7, which is above 5. So yes, 6.4%.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, 6.3775 is 6.3775. When rounding to one decimal place, you look at the second decimal digit. The first is 3, the second is 7. Since 7 >=5, you round the 3 up by 1, making it 4. So 6.4%.

Similarly, the preferred stock's 5.9405% would be 5.9% when rounded to one decimal place because the second decimal is 4, which is less than 5, so it stays as 5.9%.

So bond yield is 6.4%, stock is 5.9%. So the bond has a higher yield.

The difference is 6.4% - 5.9% = 0.5%. So the bond yields 0.5% more.

Looking at the options, the bond gives a higher yield by 0.5%. So the correct option is B: The bond. Wait, no, let's check the options.

Wait, the options are:

A: The preferred stock
B: The bond
C: Both the same
D: Preferred, by 0.7%
E: Preferred, by 1.2%
F: Bond, by 0.5%
G: Bond, by 2.0%
H: Cannot be determined
I: Preferred, by 0.3%
J: Bond, by 1.5%

So according to our calculations, the bond yields 6.4%, the stock 5.9%. So the bond is higher by 0.5%, which is option F.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I calculate the preferred stock correctly? Let me double-check.

The preferred stock: each share is $101, 10 shares is $1010. Dividends per share are 6% of $100, which is $6 per year. So 10 shares give $60 per year.

So 60 / 1010 = 0.059405, which is 5.9405%. Rounded to nearest tenth is 5.9%.

Bond: 62.5 / 980 = 0.063775, which is 6.3775%, rounded to 6.4%.

Difference is 0.5%. So bond is better by 0.5%, which is option F.

But wait, let's make sure I didn't miss anything. Another way to calculate effective yield for bonds is using the formula:

Effective Yield = (C + (F - P)/n) / P

Where:
C = annual coupon payment
F = face value
P = purchase price
n = number of years until maturity.

Wait, but wait, in this case, we don't know the time until maturity. Hmm, the problem doesn't specify the time to maturity for the bond. So maybe I'm missing something here. Because without knowing the maturity, perhaps I should assume it's an annual payment and calculate the yield accordingly, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but in the problem, it's stated as a 6 1/4% bond. So perhaps it's a perpetuity, but no, usually bonds have a maturity date. Alternatively, perhaps it's a zero-coupon bond, but no, it's a 6.25% coupon.

Wait, perhaps the problem is simply considering the current yield, which is the coupon payment divided by the purchase price, without considering the time value of money beyond that. Because without knowing the maturity date, we can't compute the yield to maturity accurately.

So in this case, perhaps the current yield is what's being considered, which is what I calculated earlier: 6.38% for the bond and 5.94% for the stock.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the yield to maturity, but without the years to maturity, I can't compute that.

Wait, but perhaps I should think again. The bond is priced at 98, which is $980 for a $1000 bond. The coupon is 6.25% annually, so $62.50 per year. If I were to calculate the yield to maturity, the formula would be:

YTM = (C + (F - P)/n) / ((F + P)/2)

Wait, but without knowing n, the number of years, I can't compute this. Since the problem doesn't mention the time to maturity, maybe it's assuming that the bond is sold at maturity, but that wouldn't make sense because the price would be $1000 at maturity, but it's bought at 98, which is a discount. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the simple current yield, which is just the coupon divided by the purchase price, as I did earlier.

In that case, the bond's effective yield is approximately 6.38%, and the stock's is 5.94%. So bond is better by about 0.44%, which is roughly 0.5% when rounded to the nearest tenth.

So the correct answer would be option F: The bond, by 0.5%.

But let me just make sure that the question is indeed asking for current yield and not something else.

Yes, the question uses the term "effective yield," which in the context of bonds and preferred stock, often refers to the current yield, which is the annual income divided by the purchase price.

So I think my initial approach is correct.
</think>

To determine which investment gives the greater effective yield, we calculate the current yield for both the bond and the preferred stock. The current yield is the annual income divided by the total investment.

### Bond:
- **Face value**: $1,000
- **Purchase price**: 98% of $1,000 = $980
- **Annual coupon payment**: 6.25% of $1,000 = $62.50
- **Current yield**:  
  \[
  \text{Current Yield (Bond)} = \frac{\$62.50}{\$980} \times 100 \approx 6.38\%
  \]

### Preferred Stock:
- **Par value per share**: $100
- **Purchase price per share**: $101
- **Total investment for 10 shares**: \(10 \times \$101 = \$1,010\)
- **Annual dividend per share**: 6% of $100 = $6
- **Total annual dividends for 10 shares**: \(10 \times \$6 = \$60\)
- **Current yield**:  
  \[
  \text{Current Yield (Stock)} = \frac{\$60}{\$1,010} \times 100 \approx 5.94\%
  \]

### Comparison:
- The bond has a current yield of approximately **6.38%**.
- The preferred stock has a current yield of approximately **5.94%**.
- The difference in yield is:  
  \[
  6.38\% - 5.94\% = 0.44\%
  \]
  Rounded to the nearest tenth of a percent, the bond yields **0.5%** more than the preferred stock.

### Conclusion:
The bond provides a greater effective yield than the preferred stock by approximately **0.5%**.
