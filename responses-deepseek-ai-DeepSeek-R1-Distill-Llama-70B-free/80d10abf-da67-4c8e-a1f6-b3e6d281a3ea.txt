Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see what the question is about.

The question is about the probability of a neutron causing fission in a uranium-238 nucleus. The neutron has an energy of 2.0 MeV, which I remember is a typical energy for neutrons released in fission reactions. The cross-section given is 0.68 barns. I'm a bit fuzzy on what a barn is exactly, but I think it's a unit of area used in nuclear physics to measure the probability of a certain interaction happening. A barn is 10^-24 square centimeters, right?

So the setup is a pure U-238 sample that's 3.2 cm thick. We need to find the probability that a neutron will cause fission as it passes through this sample. Hmm, probability... I think this relates to the concept of neutron attenuation or something like that.

Wait, in these problems, I remember something about the "mean free path" or maybe the "attenuation coefficient". Oh right! The probability depends on the neutron's cross-section, the density of target nuclei, and the thickness of the material. The formula I think is P = 1 - e^(-nσx), where n is the number of nuclei per unit volume, σ is the cross-section, and x is the thickness. But wait, no, maybe it's the product of nσx that's in the exponent.

Wait, another thought: if the probability is low, maybe we can approximate it. Like, if the exponent is small, then e^(-y) is approximately 1 - y, so P ≈ nσx. Because if y is small, 1 - e^(-y) ≈ y. So the probability would be roughly the product of the number of targets, the cross-section, and the path length. But I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

First, I need to find the number of U-238 nuclei per unit volume in the sample. To do that, I need the density of U-238. Wait, what's the density of uranium? I'm not exactly sure, but I think it's around 19 g/cm³. Let me check that—yeah, I think that's correct. So the density ρ is 19 g/cm³.

The molar mass of U-238 is approximately 238 grams per mole. Using Avogadro's number, which is about 6.022e23 atoms/mol, I can find the number of nuclei per cm³.

So, number density n = (ρ / M) * N_A. Plugging in the numbers:

n = (19 g/cm³) / (238 g/mol) ) * 6.022e23 mol⁻¹

Let me calculate that. 19 divided by 238 is approximately 0.0798 (since 238 * 0.08 is about 19.04). So 0.0798 * 6.022e23 ≈ 4.8e22 nuclei/cm³. Wait, let me compute that more accurately.

Wait, 19 / 238 is exactly 0.0798 mol/g? Hmm, no, wait—the units are (g/cm³) / (g/mol) = mol/cm³. So yes, that's correct. So 19/238 ≈ 0.0798, and then 0.0798 * 6.022e23 ≈ 4.8e22 cm^-3. Let me calculate it step by step.

19 / 238 ≈ 0.0798 mol/cm³. Multiply by Avogadro's number: 0.0798 * 6.022e23 ≈ 4.8e22 nuclei per cm³.

Wait, wait—let me double-check that calculation. 0.0798 times 6e23 is about 4.788e22, yeah.

Now, the cross-section σ is given as 0.68 barns. Since 1 barn is 1e-24 cm², σ = 0.68e-24 cm².

The thickness x is 3.2 cm.

So the product nσx is (4.8e22 cm⁻³) * (0.68e-24 cm²) * (3.2 cm).

Let me compute that step by step.

First, multiply n and σ: 4.8e22 * 0.68e-24 = (4.8 * 0.68) * 10^(22-24) = 3.264 * 10^-2.

Then multiply by x (3.2 cm): 3.264e-2 * 3.2 = let's see: 3.264 * 3.2 = approximately 10.4448, and then times 1e-2, so 0.104448.

Wait, more accurately: 3.264e-2 * 3.2 = 3.264 *3.2 = let's compute 3 *3.2=9.6, 0.264*3.2=0.8448, so total is 10.4448. So 10.4448e-2, which is 0.104448.

So the exponent in the formula is about 0.1044. So the probability P is 1 - e^(-0.1044). Let me compute e^(-0.1044). Hmm, I remember that e^(-x) ≈ 1 - x + x²/2! - x^3/3! + ... for small x. Alternatively, I can use a calculator-like approach.

Wait, 0.1044 is a small number, so e^(-0.1) is approximately 0.9048, and e^(-0.0044) is about 0.9956. So e^(-0.1044) ≈ e^(-0.1) * e^(-0.0044) ≈ 0.9048 * 0.9956 ≈ 0.8999. Alternatively, I can compute it more accurately.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute it directly. Let me think about e^(-0.1) = about 0.904837, and then for the remaining 0.0044:

e^(-0.0044) ≈ 1 - 0.0044 + (0.0044)^2/2 - (0.0044)^3/6.

Calculating each term:

0.0044 squared is 0.00001936, divided by 2 is 0.00000968.

0.0044 cubed is 0.000085184, divided by 6 is approximately 0.000014197.

So e^(-0.0044) ≈ 1 - 0.0044 + 0.00000968 - 0.000014197 ≈ 1 -0.0044 = 0.9956 +0.00000968=0.99561-0.000014197=0.9956.

Wait, but wait—0.9956 times e^(-0.1) which is 0.904837. So 0.904837 * 0.9956 ≈ let me compute that.

0.9 * 0.9956 = 0.8959, and 0.004837 *0.9956 ≈ 0.004815. So total is approximately 0.8959 + 0.004815 ≈ 0.9007.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately. Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach for e^(-0.1044). Let me see, 0.1044 is approximately 0.1, so e^(-0.1) is about 0.9048, as I said before. Now, 0.1044 is 0.1 plus 0.0044, so I can use the Taylor expansion around x=0.1.

Alternatively, perhaps use the approximation that for small delta, e^{-(a + delta)} ≈ e^{-a} * (1 - delta + delta²/2 ...). Wait, but maybe it's better to compute 0.1044 in terms of known e^-x values.

Alternatively, perhaps just accept that for x=0.1044, e^-x is about 0.9007, so P = 1 - 0.9007 = 0.0993, approximately 0.1, which is 10% probability.

Wait, that would make the probability about 0.0993, which is close to 0.1. Looking at the options, option G is 0.1. But let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, let me re-calculate nσx. Maybe I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

n = (19 g/cm³) / (238 g/mol) ) * 6.022e23 atoms/mol.

So 19/238 is about 0.0798 mol/cm³. Multiply by 6.022e23, gives 0.0798 *6.022e23 ≈ (0.0798 *6.022) x 1e23.

0.0798 *6=0.4788; 0.0798 *0.022=0.0017556. So total ≈ 0.4788 +0.0017556≈ 0.4805556. So 0.4805556e23 = 4.805556e22 cm^-3.

Then, σ = 0.68e-24 cm².

So nσ = 4.805556e22 * 0.68e-24 = (4.805556 * 0.68) x 1e-2.

4.8 *0.68 is roughly 3.264, but more accurately: 4 *0.68=2.72, 0.805556 *0.68 ≈ 0.547178. So total is 2.72 +0.547178≈3.267178. So 3.267178e-2.

Multiply by x=3.2 cm: 3.267178e-2 *3.2 = 0.104551.

So the exponent is 0.104551. Now, to compute e^-0.104551.

Using more precise calculation:

The value of e^-0.1 is approximately 0.904837.
The value of e^-0.004551 can be approximated. Let me compute e^-0.004551.

Using the Taylor series: e^-x ≈ 1 - x + x²/2 - x³/6.

x = 0.004551.

So:

1 - 0.004551 = 0.995449.

x²/2 = (0.004551)^2 / 2 ≈ (0.0000207) / 2 ≈ 0.00001035.

x³/6 = (0.004551)^3 /6 ≈ (0.0000943) /6 ≈ 0.0000157.

So e^-x ≈ 0.995449 + 0.00001035 - 0.0000157 ≈ 0.995449 + (0.00001035 - 0.0000157) = 0.995449 - 0.00000535 ≈ 0.9954436.

So e^-0.104551 = e^-(0.1 + 0.004551) = e^-0.1 * e^-0.004551 ≈ 0.904837 * 0.9954436.

Calculating that product:

0.9 *0.9954436 ≈ 0.8958.

0.004837 *0.9954436 ≈ approximately 0.00481.

Adding together: 0.8958 + 0.00481 ≈ 0.90061.

So e^-0.104551 ≈ 0.90061.

Therefore, the probability P = 1 - 0.90061 = 0.09939, which is approximately 0.0994, or 0.1 (10%).

Looking back at the options, option G is 0.1. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculations. Alternatively, perhaps the initial approach is correct, but maybe I should consider whether I'm using the correct formula.

Another approach: the formula for the probability of interaction is P = 1 - e^(-Σx), where Σ is the macroscopic cross-section, which is nσ. So Σx is the product of n, σ, and x, which is what I computed as approximately 0.1045. So P = 1 - e^(-0.1045) ≈ 0.0994, which is 0.1.

So the correct answer would be G: 0.1.

To determine the probability of a 2.0-MeV neutron producing fission in a pure U-238 sample of thickness 3.2 cm, we use the formula:

\[
P = 1 - e^{-n \sigma x}
\]

where:
- \( n \) is the number density of U-238 nuclei per unit volume,
- \( \sigma \) is the neutron cross-section for fission,
- \( x \) is the thickness of the sample.

### Step 1: Calculate the number density \( n \)
The density of U-238 is approximately \( \rho = 19 \, \text{g/cm}^3 \), and its molar mass is \( M = 238 \, \text{g/mol} \). Using Avogadro's number \( N_A = 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{mol}^{-1} \), the number density is:

\[
n = \frac{\rho}{M} N_A = \frac{19}{238} \times 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{cm}^{-3}
\]

First, calculate \( \frac{19}{238} \approx 0.0798 \, \text{mol/cm}^3 \). Then:

\[
n \approx 0.0798 \times 6.022 \times 10^{23} \approx 4.805 \times 10^{22} \, \text{cm}^{-3}
\]

### Step 2: Multiply \( n \), \( \sigma \), and \( x \)
The cross-section is \( \sigma = 0.68 \, \text{barn} = 0.68 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{cm}^2 \), and the thickness is \( x = 3.2 \, \text{cm} \). The product \( n \sigma x \) is:

\[
n \sigma x = (4.805 \times 10^{22}) \times (0.68 \times 10^{-24}) \times 3.2
\]

First, calculate \( n \sigma \):

\[
n \sigma = 4.805 \times 10^{22} \times 0.68 \times 10^{-24} = 3.267 \times 10^{-2}
\]

Then multiply by \( x = 3.2 \):

\[
n \sigma x = 3.267 \times 10^{-2} \times 3.2 = 0.1045
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the probability \( P \)
Using \( P = 1 - e^{-n \sigma x} \), where \( n \sigma x = 0.1045 \), we calculate \( e^{-0.1045} \). For small \( x \), \( e^{-x} \) can be approximated, but here we compute it directly:

\[
e^{-0.1045} \approx 0.9006
\]

Thus:

\[
P = 1 - 0.9006 = 0.0994
\]

### Final Answer
The probability of a 2.0-MeV neutron producing fission in the U-238 sample is approximately \( 0.1 \). Comparing this to the options, the correct answer is:

**G: 0.1**
