Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let's see, it's about X-linked recessive conditions. Hmm. I remember that X-linked recessive diseases are those where the defective gene is on the X chromosome. Since males have only one X (and one Y), if they inherit the defective X, they'll definitely show the condition. Females, on the other hand, have two X chromosomes, so they need both to be defective to show the condition.

The question gives me that the frequency of affected males is 0.10, which is 10%. I think that in males, the frequency of the condition is equal to the frequency of the recessive allele in the population because they only have one X. So if 10% of males are affected, the frequency of the recessive allele (let's call it 'q') is 0.10.

Now for females. For a female to be affected, she needs both X chromosomes to carry the recessive allele. The frequency of affected females should be q squared, right? Because each X has a q chance of carrying the allele, and females have two X's, so q * q.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing this up. The Hardy-Weinberg principle says that p^2 + 2pq + q^2 =1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele and q is the recessive. In this case, q is 0.10, so q squared would be (0.10)^2 which is 0.01. So the expected frequency of affected females is 0.01, which is 1%.

Looking at the options, option B is 0.01. So I think that's the correct answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Are there any other factors I'm missing? Like, X inactivation or something else? No, X inactivation is more about expression in females, but for the presence of the condition, it's whether both alleles are recessive. So if a female has one normal and one defective, she's a carrier but not affected. So yes, only when both are defective does she show the condition.

So yeah, option B should be the correct answer.

In X-linked recessive conditions, males are affected if they inherit the defective X chromosome, as they have only one X chromosome. Therefore, the frequency of affected males directly reflects the frequency of the recessive allele (\(q\)) in the population. Given that 10% of males are affected, \(q = 0.10\).

For females to be affected, they must inherit two defective X chromosomes, making the frequency of affected females \(q^2\). Substituting \(q = 0.10\), we find \(q^2 = (0.10)^2 = 0.01\), or 1%.

Thus, the expected frequency of affected females is **0.01**, corresponding to option **B**.
