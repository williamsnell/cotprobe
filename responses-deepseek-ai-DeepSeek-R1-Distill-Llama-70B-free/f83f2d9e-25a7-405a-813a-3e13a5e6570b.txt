Question:

In what way is Responsibility to Protect (R2P) different from humanitarian intervention?

Options:

A: R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis
B: R2P always involves economic sanctions, whereas humanitarian intervention does not
C: R2P is essentially the same as humanitarian intervention
D: R2P requires a call for assistance by the State in distress
E: R2P always involves armed force, whereas humanitarian intervention does not
F: Humanitarian intervention is essentially the same as R2P
G: Humanitarian intervention always requires UNSC approval while R2P does not
H: Humanitarian intervention requires a call for assistance by the State in distress while R2P does not
I: R2P is more arbitrary because it does not require UNSC input
J: R2P is a broader concept that includes economic sanctions, whereas humanitarian intervention is strictly military

Okay, so I have this question about the difference between Responsibility to Protect (R2P) and humanitarian intervention. Hmm, I remember that both concepts are related to international responses to crises, but they're not exactly the same. Let me think through this carefully.

I think humanitarian intervention is when a state or group of states intervenes in another state's affairs without UN Security Council approval, usually citing a humanitarian reason like stopping a genocide. It's more unilateral, right? Like what happened in Kosovo maybe, where NATO intervened without a UNSC resolution because Russia and China were against it.

On the other hand, R2P, which stands for Responsibility to Protect, is a more formal doctrine. I remember it was endorsed by the UN General Assembly in 2005. R2P is based on the idea that states have a responsibility to protect their own citizens from atrocities. If they fail, the international community has a responsibility to step in, but I think this is supposed to happen with UN authorization, so through the Security Council.

So, the key difference here is probably the role of the UN Security Council. Humanitarian intervention doesn't require UNSC approval and can be done by individual states or coalitions, whereas R2P operates under UN auspices, meaning it needs UNSC input or approval.

Looking at the options now:

Option A says R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and aims to avert a humanitarian crisis. That sounds right because having UNSC involvement makes it more structured and less arbitrary than unilateral actions.

Option B: R2P always involves economic sanctions. I don't think that's true. R2P can involve various measures, including diplomatic, economic, and military. But it's not always economic sanctions. So B might not be correct.

Option C: They are essentially the same. No, I think they're different because of the UN involvement aspect.

Option D: R2P requires a call for help from the state in distress. Wait, I thought R2P applies when the state has failed to protect its citizens, so maybe the state doesn't call for help. In fact, sometimes the state is the perpetrator. So D might be incorrect.

Option E: R2P always involves armed force. No, R2P can start with other measures before military intervention. So E is wrong.

Option F: Same as C, but phrased differently. Not correct.

Option G: Humanitarian intervention always needs UNSC approval? No, that's not right. Humanitarian intervention is often without UNSC approval, which is why it's controversial. So G is wrong.

Option H: Humanitarian intervention requires a call for help, R2P doesn't. Wait, I'm not sure. Maybe in some cases, but I think R2P can apply even without the state asking for help because the state might be the one causing the problem.

Option I: R2P is more arbitrary because no UNSC input. No, I thought R2P requires UNSC, making it less arbitrary. So I is wrong.

Option J: R2P is broader, including economic sanctions, while humanitarian is strictly military. I think R2P is broader but so is humanitarian intervention, which can include various measures. Not sure about J.

So the best option seems to be A. R2P is less arbitrary because it involves UNSC input, which makes it more structured and less likely to be arbitrary. Also, its main goal is to prevent humanitarian crises.

The Responsibility to Protect (R2P) and humanitarian intervention are distinct concepts in international relations. Humanitarian intervention typically involves unilateral or coalition actions without UN Security Council (UNSC) approval, often in response to humanitarian crises. In contrast, R2P is a formal doctrine endorsed by the UN General Assembly in 2005, emphasizing that states have a responsibility to protect their citizens from atrocities. When states fail in this responsibility, the international community, ideally through UNSC authorization, may intervene. 

R2P is less arbitrary than humanitarian intervention because it requires UNSC input, providing a structured framework for intervention. Its primary objective is to avert humanitarian crises, and it can involve a range of measures, including diplomatic, economic, and military actions. Humanitarian intervention, on the other hand, often bypasses UNSC approval and is more unilateral in nature.

Given these distinctions, the correct answer is:

**A: R2P is less arbitrary because it requires some UNSC input and its primary objective is to avert a humanitarian crisis.**
