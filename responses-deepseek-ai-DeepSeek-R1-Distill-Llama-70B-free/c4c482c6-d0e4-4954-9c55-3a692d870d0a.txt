Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the tax rate for Smithville. Hmm, let me try to figure this out.

Alright, the assessed valuation is $52,384,600. And the taxes they need to raise are for three different things: a new project, education, and health. So I think I need to add up all those taxes first.

Let me see. The new project is $123,475, education is $931,442.75, and health is $319,878. So adding those up: 123,475 plus 931,442.75. Let me calculate that. 123,475 + 931,442.75 = 1,054,917.75. Then add 319,878. So 1,054,917.75 + 319,878. Let me do that. 1,054,917.75 + 300,000 is 1,354,917.75, then add 19,878: 1,354,917.75 + 19,878 = 1,374,795.75. So total taxes needed are $1,374,795.75.

Now, tax rate is usually total tax divided by assessed valuation. So tax rate (as a decimal) would be 1,374,795.75 divided by 52,384,600. Let me compute that. Hmm, let me write that out.

So 1,374,795.75 / 52,384,600. Let me approximate. Let's see, approximately 1.37 million divided by 52.38 million. So 1.37 / 52.38. Let me do that division.

Wait, 52.3846 million is the denominator. Let me compute 1,374,795.75 divided by 52,384,600.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to compute it as (total tax) / (assessment) * 100 to get a percentage.

So, 1,374,795.75 / 52,384,600 = ?

Let me compute this step by step. Let's see, 52,384,600 goes into 1,374,795.75 how many times?

So, 52,384,600 * 0.02 = 1,047,692. So 0.02 is 2%, which would be 1,047,692. But our total is 1,374,795.75, which is higher than that.

How much is 0.026 times 52,384,600? Let me compute 52,384,600 * 0.026.

0.02 * 52,384,600 = 1,047,692. 0.006 * 52,384,600 is 314,307.6. So 1,047,692 + 314,307.6 = 1,361,999.6.

Hmm, our total is 1,374,795.75. So 0.026 gets us to 1,361,999.6. The difference is 1,374,795.75 - 1,361,999.6 = 12,796.15.

So how much more do we need beyond 0.026? Let's compute 12,796.15 / 52,384,600.

That's approximately 0.000244 (since 52,384,600 * 0.000244 ≈ 12,796). So adding that to 0.026 gives 0.026244, which is 2.6244%.

Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately.

Alternatively, using a calculator approach:

1,374,795.75 ÷ 52,384,600 = ?

Let me write this as a division: 1,374,795.75 ÷ 52,384,600.

Divide numerator and denominator by 100 to make it easier: 13,747.9575 ÷ 523,846. Let me compute that.

Hmm, 523846 × 0.026 is approximately 13,620. So 523846 × 0.026 = 13,620 (exactly, 523,846 * 0.026 = let's compute 523,846 * 26 /1000.

Compute 523,846 *26: 523,846 *20=10,476,920. 523,846 *6=3,143,076. Sum: 13,619,996. So 13,619,996 /1000 = 13,619.996.

But our numerator is 13,747.9575. So the difference is 13,747.9575 - 13,619.996 = 127.9615.

So now, 127.9615 divided by 523,846 equals approximately 0.000244.

So total is approximately 0.026 + 0.000244 = 0.026244, so 2.6244%. Rounded to thousandths, that would be 2.624%.

Wait, but let me check the exact calculation with a calculator. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the exact value.

Alternatively, maybe I should express the tax rate as (total tax) / (assessment) * 100.

Total tax is 123,475 + 931,442.75 + 319,878 = let me recalculate that. 123,475 + 931,442.75 is 1,054,917.75. Adding 319,878 gives 1,374,795.75.

So 1,374,795.75 / 52,384,600 = let me compute this exactly. Let's see, 1,374,795.75 ÷ 52,384,600.

Let me compute 1,374,795.75 ÷ 52,384,600.

I can write this as (approx) 1.37e6 / 5.23846e7 = (1.37 / 52.3846) * (1e6 / 1e7) ) →  (0.02616) * (0.1) → wait no, wait, wait, that's not correct.

Wait, 1.37e6 is 1,370,000 and 5.23846e7 is 52,384,600. So 1,370,000 / 52,384,600 = approximately 0.02616.

Wait, but our numerator is 1,374,795.75, which is 1,370,000 + 4,795.75. So let me compute 1,374,795.75 / 52,384,600.

So 52,384,600 × 0.026 = 1,361,999.6 → as I did before. So 1,374,795.75 - 1,361,999.6 = 12,796.15.

So 12,796.15 /52,384,600 = 0.000244 approx.

Adding that to 0.026 gives 0.026244, so 2.6244%. So part (a) is 2.624% when rounded to thousandths.

Wait, but wait. The question says "to thousandths of a percent." So 2.624% is already to thousandths.

So part (a) is 2.624%.

Now, moving to part (b): tax rate in mills per $1.

Mills are thousandths of a dollar, so 1 mill is $0.001 per $1 of assessed value.

Wait, or wait, no: a mill is 1/1000 of a dollar, so per $1 of assessed value, 1 mill is $0.001.

Wait, but tax rates can also be expressed as mills per dollar.

So the tax rate in mills is (tax rate in dollars per dollar) * 1000.

Because 1 mill = 0.001 dollars per dollar. So if the tax rate is R dollars per dollar, then in mills it's R / 0.001 = R * 1000 mills.

So in this case, R is 0.026244, so 0.026244 * 1000 = 26.244 mills per $1. So 26.244 mills per $1. Rounded to thousandths? Well, the question for part (b) says 'in mills per $1 of assessed value.' So perhaps it's 26.244, but looking at the options, all are given to the nearest hundredth or thousandth? Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option B: 2.624%, 26.24 mills per $1, etc. So in (b) it's 26.24. So I think 26.24 is correct.

Wait, but wait, in the calculation, I had 0.026244 as the tax rate. So 26.244 mills. But the options have 26.24, so perhaps they rounded to the nearest hundredth.

So for part (b), 26.24 mills per $1.

Part (c): in cents per $100 of assessed value.

Hmm. So tax per $100 is the rate times 100.

So the tax rate is 2.624% per dollar. So per $100, it's 2.624 * 100 = 262.4 cents.

Because 2.624% of $100 is 2.624 dollars, which is 262.4 cents.

So part (c) is 262.4 cents per $100.

Part (d): in mills per $1,000 of assessed value.

Wait, 1 mill is $0.001 per $1, but for $1,000, how many mills would that be?

Wait, if the tax rate is 26.244 mills per $1, then per $1,000 it's 26.244 * 1000 = 26,244 mills.

Wait, no. Wait, no, wait. Wait, per $1,000, the tax in dollars would be the tax rate (in dollars per dollar) times 1,000.

So tax per $1,000 is 0.026244 * 1000 = $26.244.

But since 1 mill is $0.001 per $1, then in terms of mills per $1,000, it's 26.244 dollars per $1,000, which is 26,244 mills per $1,000. Because each dollar is 1,000 mills, so 26.244 dollars is 26,244 * 0.001 dollars, which is 26,244 mills.

Wait, wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently.

If the tax rate is 26.244 mills per $1, then per $1,000 it's 26.244 * 1000 = 26,244 mills. So that's part (d).

So looking at the options:

Option B: 2.624%, 26.24 mills per $1, 262.4 cents per $100, 26,240 mills per $1,000.

Wait, but wait. For part (d), I calculated 26,244, but option B says 26,240. Hmm. So perhaps I should recheck the calculations.

Wait, the total was 2.6244% tax rate, which is 26.244 mills per $1. So per $1,000 it's 26.244 * 1000 = 26,244. So why is option B 26,240?

Ah, perhaps because the exact tax rate is 26.24 mills when rounded to two decimal places. Let me see.

Wait, the exact tax rate calculation: 1,374,795.75 / 52,384,600 = ?

Let me compute this more accurately.

Using a calculator approach:

1,374,795.75 ÷ 52,384,600 =

I can write this as 1,374,795.75 ÷ 52,384,600 = (1,374,795.75 ÷ 52,384,600) = ?

Let me compute 52,384,600 × 0.026 = 1,361,999.6.

The difference is 1,374,795.75 - 1,361,999.6 = 12,796.15.

So 12,796.15 ÷ 52,384,600 = approx 0.000244.

So adding to 0.026, we get 0.026244, so 2.6244%.

So 2.6244% is the exact tax rate. To thousandths, that's 2.624% because the next digit is 4, which is less than 5, so it stays 2.624%.

Wait, no. Wait, 2.6244% is 2.624% when rounded to three decimal places? Wait, 2.6244 is 2.624 when rounded to thousandths because the fourth decimal is 4, which is less than 5, so you don't round up.

Wait, no. Wait, 0.026244 is 2.6244%. So to three decimal places, it's 2.624% (as the fourth is 4, so it rounds down).

So tax rate is 2.624%.

Mills per $1 is 26.244, which when rounded to two decimals would be 26.24.

So the options have 26.24, which matches.

So part (d) is 26,240 mills per $1,000. Because 26.24 * 1000 = 26,240.

Wait, but earlier when I multiplied 26.244 * 1000, I get 26,244. So perhaps the exact value is 26,244, but option B says 26,240. Hmm. That suggests that perhaps the tax rate is being rounded at each step.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the total tax.

Total tax: 123,475 + 931,442.75 = 1,054,917.75. Adding 319,878 gives 1,374,795.75. Yes, that's correct.

So 1,374,795.75 / 52,384,600 = ?

Let me compute this division more accurately. Let me write it as:

1,374,795.75 ÷ 52,384,600.

Let me perform the division step by step.

52,384,600 × 0.02 = 1,047,692.00.

Subtracting this from 1,374,795.75 gives 1,374,795.75 - 1,047,692.00 = 327,103.75.

Now, how many times does 52,384,600 go into 327,103.75? Well, 52,384,600 × 0.006 = 314,307.60.

Subtracting: 327,103.75 - 314,307.60 = 12,796.15.

Now, 52,384,600 × 0.000244 ≈ 12,796.15, as done earlier.

So total is 0.02 + 0.006 + 0.000244 = 0.026244, which is 2.6244%.

So 2.6244% is the exact rate. So for part (a), it's 2.624% when rounded to three decimal places.

So for (b): 26.244 mills per $1. But the options have 26.24, so I think they rounded to two decimal places.

Similarly, for (d), when you have 26.244 mills per $1, per $1,000 it's 26.244 * 1000 = 26,244. But since part (b) is 26.24, perhaps in (d) it's 26,240, matching the option.

So the correct option is B: 2.624%, 26.24 mills per $1, 262.4 cents per $100, 26,240 mills per $1000.

Wait, but wait, let me check another way.

Alternatively, perhaps calculating the tax rate in each unit.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the total tax as $1,374,795.75.

The assessed value is $52,384,600.

The tax rate is (1,374,795.75 /52,384,600) * 100 = 2.6244%.

So part (a) is 2.624%.

Part (b): tax rate in mills per $1. Since 1 mill is $0.001, the tax per $1 is 0.026244 dollars, which is 26.244 mills.

Part (c): tax per $100 is 100 * 0.026244 = 2.6244 dollars, which is 262.44 cents. So 262.4 cents when rounded to the nearest tenth.

Part (d): tax per $1,000 is 1,000 * 0.026244 = 26.244 dollars, which is 26,244 mills. But in the options, part (d) is 26,240. Hmm, this is a discrepancy.

Wait, perhaps due to rounding. Let me see:

If part (b) is 26.24 (rounded to two decimal places), then per $1,000 it's 26.24 * 1000 = 26,240.

So the options are probably rounded at each step, leading to 26,240 in part (d).

So looking at the options, option B has all the correct values except for part (d) being 26,240 instead of 26,244. But perhaps that's due to rounding at each step instead of using the exact value.

So the correct answer is option B.
</think>

The assessed valuation of the taxable property in Smithville is $52,384,600, and the total taxes to be raised are $1,374,795.75. To calculate the tax rate and its various expressions:

1. **Tax Rate (as a percentage):**  
   The tax rate is calculated by dividing the total taxes by the assessed valuation and multiplying by 100:  
   \[
   \text{Tax Rate} = \left( \frac{1,374,795.75}{52,384,600} \right) \times 100 = 2.6244\%.
   \]  
   Rounded to thousandths of a percent, the tax rate is **2.624%**.

2. **Tax Rate in Mills per $1 of Assessed Value:**  
   Since 1 mill is $0.001 per $1 of assessed value, the tax rate in mills is:  
   \[
   \text{Mills per $1} = 2.6244 \times 1000 = 26.244 \, \text{mills}.
   \]  
   Rounded to two decimal places, this is **26.24 mills per $1**.

3. **Tax Rate in Cents per $100 of Assessed Value:**  
   The tax rate per $100 is calculated by multiplying
