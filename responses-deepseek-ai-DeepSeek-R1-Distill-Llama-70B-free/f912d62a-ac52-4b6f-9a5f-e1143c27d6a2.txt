Alright, so I'm trying to figure out which famous folksinger founded the Institute for the Study of Non-Violence in 1965. The options are A through J, and each is a well-known name in the folk music scene. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the 1960s were a big time for folk singers getting involved in social activism, especially around civil rights and anti-war movements. So the person in question was probably quite active during that era.

The Institute for the Study of Non-Violence sounds like it's related to promoting peaceful methods of conflict resolution, which aligns with the teachings of people like Martin Luther King Jr. and Mahatma Gandhi. So I'm thinking the founder might have been someone who was a strong advocate for non-violent protest.

Looking at the options:

A: Joni Mitchell - She's a very influential singer-songwriter, but I don't recall her specifically founding an institute like this. She was more known for her music and personal activism.

B: Pete Seeger - He was a key figure in the folk revival and a strong activist. I know he was involved in various causes, including civil rights and anti-war protests. But did he found this institute?

C: Judy Collins - She's another prominent folksinger, known for her voice and activism, but I'm not sure about her founding an institute.

D: Woody Guthrie - A major figure in American folk music, but he passed away in 1967. The institute was founded in 1965, so maybe, but I'm not sure if he was directly involved in founding it.

E: Bob Dylan - While Dylan was a huge figure in the 60s and wrote many protest songs, I don't think he was the one to start this particular institute.

F: Arlo Guthrie - Son of Woody Guthrie, known for "Alice's Restaurant." I don't recall him being associated with this institute.

G: Peter Yarrow - From Peter, Paul and Mary. They were definitely involved in activism, but I'm not sure about the institute.

H: Joan Baez - She was very involved in civil rights and non-violent movements. I think she might have been connected to this. I remember something about her being involved in an institute promoting non-violence.

I: Neil Young - More of a rock artist, though he did folk rock. Not sure about the institute.

J: Paul Simon - From Simon & Garfunkel. Again, activist but not sure about this specific institute.

So narrowing it down, I think it's between Pete Seeger (B) and Joan Baez (H). I remember that Joan Baez was quite involved in non-violent activism and maybe even founded an organization. Wait, I think the Institute for the Study of Non-Violence was actually founded by Joan Baez. She was a strong advocate and might have started it in the mid-60s.
