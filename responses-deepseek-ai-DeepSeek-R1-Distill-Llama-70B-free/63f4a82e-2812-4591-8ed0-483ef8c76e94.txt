Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a car's acceleration. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the question says the car starts from rest and reaches 30 miles per hour in 8 seconds. I need to find its acceleration. The options are given in feet per second squared, so I guess I'll have to convert units somewhere.

Wait, right. The car goes from 0 to 30 mph. Oh wait, acceleration is change in velocity over time. So the formula is a = (v_final - v_initial) / time. Since it starts from rest, v_initial is 0, so a = v_final / time.

But wait, the velocity is given in miles per hour, and the answer needs to be in feet per second squared. I remember that 1 mile is 5280 feet, and 1 hour is 3600 seconds. So I need to convert 30 mph to feet per second.

Let me calculate that. 30 miles per hour equals 30 * 5280 feet per hour. But wait, per hour is 3600 seconds. So 30 mph is (30 * 5280) / 3600 feet per second.

Let me do the math. 30 times 5280 is... 30 * 5280. Let me see, 5280 * 30. Well, 5280 * 10 is 52,800, times 3 is 158,400. So 158,400 feet per hour. Dividing by 3600 gives me feet per second.

158400 divided by 3600. Hmm, let's see. 3600 goes into 158400 how many times? 3600 * 44 is 158,400 because 3600 *40 is 144,000 and 3600*4 is 14,400, so 40+4=44. So 44 feet per second.

So the final velocity is 44 ft/s. The time taken is 8 seconds. So acceleration a = 44 / 8. Let me calculate that. 44 divided by 8 is 5.5. So 5.5 ft/sÂ².

Looking at the options, option C is 5.5. So the answer should be C. Wait, wait a second. Let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I make unit conversion mistakes.

Wait another approach: 30 mph is a common speed. I remember that 60 mph is 88 ft/s, so 30 mph is half of that. Oh wait, 60 mph is 88 ft/s, so 30 would be 44. Yep, that's consistent with my earlier calculation.

So acceleration is 44 divided by 8, which is 5.5. So the correct answer is option C. But wait, I should look at all the options again. Let's see the options:

Options are A:6.5, B:6.0, C:5.5, D:4.0, E:2.5, F:4.5, G:8.0, H:3.75, I:7.0, J:5.0.

Yes, C is 5.5, which matches. So I'm confident the answer is C.

The car's acceleration is calculated using the formula \( a = \frac{v_{\text{final}} - v_{\text{initial}}}{\text{time}} \). Since the car starts from rest, \( v_{\text{initial}} = 0 \), so \( a = \frac{v_{\text{final}}}{\text{time}} \). The final velocity is given as 30 miles per hour, which needs to be converted to feet per second. 

1 mile = 5280 feet, and 1 hour = 3600 seconds. Thus,  
\[
30 \, \text{mph} = \frac{30 \times 5280}{3600} = 44 \, \text{ft/s}.
\]

The acceleration is then  
\[
a = \frac{44 \, \text{ft/s}}{8 \, \text{seconds}} = 5.5 \, \text{ft/s}^2.
\]

From the given options, the correct answer is **C: 5.5 ft per sec per sec**.
