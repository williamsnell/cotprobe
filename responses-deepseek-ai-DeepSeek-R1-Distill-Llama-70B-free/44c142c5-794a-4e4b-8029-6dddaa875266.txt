Okay, so I have this question about evidence law, specifically hearsay exceptions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is a murder trial where the defense counsel is offering testimony from a man on death row. This man is admitting that he hired another man to shoot the victim. The question is about whether this testimony is hearsay and, if so, if it falls under any exception.

First, I need to remember what hearsay is. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. So, if someone testifies about what someone else said outside of court, that's hearsay unless an exception applies.

In this case, the man on death row made a statement to someone else, and now that statement is being offered in court by the defense. So the statement is being used to prove that he hired someone to kill the victim, which would mean the defendant didn't do it. So, yes, it's hearsay because it's a statement made outside of court being used for its truth.

Now, the options suggest various hearsay exceptions. Let me think through each possible exception.

Option A says it's hearsay but admissible as an admission. Admissions are one of the exceptions. But I think admissions are typically statements made by a party opponent. So if the person making the statement is a party to the case, like the defendant, their statement can be used against them. But here, the man on death row is a third party, not the defendant in this trial. So his statement wouldn't be an admission by a party opponent. Therefore, option A might not apply.

Option B suggests a dying declaration. Dying declarations are statements made by someone who believes their death is imminent, concerning the cause or circumstances of their impending death. But in this case, the man is on death row, so he might believe he's going to die soon, but the statement is about hiring someone to kill the victim. If he's the one who caused the death, his own impending death (on death row) might make his statement about the crime a dying declaration. But I'm not sure if this applies here because the statement is about the victim, not about his own cause of death. Hmm, maybe not. Also, dying declarations usually require that the declarant is unavailable, which he is since he's on death row, but I'm not certain if this fits.

Option C says it's a prior statement by a witness. The prior statement exception usually applies when a witness makes a statement that's consistent with their testimony, to rebut a charge of recent fabrication. But in this case, the witness (the man on death row) is making the statement, but he's not testifying in court; someone else is recounting his statement. So maybe that's not it.

Option D is hearsay not within any exception. If none of the exceptions apply, then it's inadmissible. So that's a possibility if none of the other options fit.

Option E says it's not hearsay. But wait, the statement is being offered for its truth, so it's hearsay. So E is probably incorrect.

Option F is about a statement made under the belief of impending death. Similar to the dying declaration but maybe broader. If the man on death row thought he was going to die, perhaps his statement would qualify. But the content is about the crime, not necessarily his own death. I'm not sure if that's the right exception here.

Option G is a statement made during or immediately after the event. That's the excited utterance exception. But the man is on death row now, so the statement is likely made long after the event. So probably not G.

Option H is for medical diagnosis or treatment. That doesn't seem relevant here since the statement is about a crime, not medical treatment.

Option I is about personal or family history. That also doesn't fit because the statement is about a criminal act, not personal history.

Wait, maybe I should reconsider the admission exception. The Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) 801(d)(2) says that a statement is not hearsay if it's offered against an opposing party and was made by the party's agent or someone else on behalf of the party. But the man on death row isn't the defendant here; he's a third party. So his statement isn't an admission by the defendant. Unless he's co-conspirator or something, but the question doesn't say that. So option A might not apply.

Another thought: could this statement be admissible under the 'statement against interest' exception? FRE 804(b)(3) says that a statement is admissible if it was against the declarant's interest at the time it was made and the declarant is unavailable. The man is on death row, so he's unavailable. His statement admitting to hiring someone to kill the victim would be against his penal interest, so it might qualify. But wait, the options don't include 'statement against interest' as an option. Looking back at the options, the choices are A-I. So none of the options mention that exception.

Wait, looking back, option F is about a statement under belief of impending death. That's FRE 801(d)(2)(B) or maybe 804(b)(6) which is for dying declarations. Alternatively, maybe it's considered a statement against interest, but again, that's not one of the options.

Hmm, the options don't include 'statement against interest', so maybe the correct answer is that it's hearsay not within any exception. So option D.

Wait, but another angle: the man on death row is making a statement that he hired someone to kill. That would be a statement that is self-inculpatory, so under FRE 804(b)(3), it's admissible if the declarant is unavailable. But the problem is that the options don't include this exception. So if the options don't include that, then the answer might be D, hearsay not within any exception.

Wait, but option F says admissible as a statement under belief of impending death. So perhaps that's the case. If the man is on death row and believes he's going to die, his statement might qualify. But the statement's content is about the crime, not his own impending death. So maybe that's a stretch.

Alternatively, if the statement is being offered as a dying declaration, that's when the declarant believes their death is imminent. But the statement is about the cause of the victim's death, which is the crime. So maybe it's a dying declaration under FRE 804(b)(2). But the problem is that the statement is about the victim's death, not the declarant's own. So perhaps that's not applicable.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me recap.

The statement is from a man on death row, so he might believe he's about to die. He says he hired someone to kill the victim. The defense offers this to prove that he did it, thus exonerating the defendant.

Is this hearsay? Yes. Now, is there an exception?

Option F says it's admissible as a statement under belief of impending death. That's the dying declaration exception, which usually applies to statements about the cause of the declarant's own death. But here, the statement is about the victim's death. So I don't think it fits. So perhaps option D is correct.

Alternatively, if the man is on death row, maybe he's considered to have made a statement under belief of impending death, so any statement he makes about any matter would be admissible. But I don't think that's the case. The dying declaration exception is more narrow.

So putting it all together, the statement is hearsay, and none of the exceptions listed in the options apply. So the answer is D: hearsay not within any recognized exception.

The question revolves around whether the statement made by a man on death row, admitting that he hired someone to shoot the victim, is hearsay and whether it falls under any recognized exception to the hearsay rule. Here's the analysis:

1. **Hearsay Definition**: Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. In this case, the statement is being offered to prove that the man on death row, not the defendant, committed the crime. Therefore, it is hearsay.

2. **Option A (Admission)**: Under FRE 801(d)(2), admissions are statements made by a party opponent that are offered against them. However, the man on death row is not the defendant in this trial, so his statement does not qualify as an admission by a party opponent. Thus, this option does not apply.

3. **Option B (Dying Declaration)**: Dying declarations (FRE 804(b)(2)) apply to statements made by a declarant who believes their death is imminent, concerning the cause or circumstances of their own impending death. While the man is on death row and may believe his death is imminent, his statement concerns the victim's death, not his own. Therefore, this exception does not apply.

4. **Option C (Prior Statement by Witness)**: This exception applies when a witness's prior statement is consistent with their testimony to rebut a charge of recent fabrication. Here, the man on death row is not testifying, and the statement is being offered through another witness. Thus, this exception does not apply.

5. **Option D (Hearsay Not Within Any Recognized Exception)**: If none of the exceptions apply, the statement remains inadmissible as hearsay. Based on the analysis, none of the exceptions listed in the options apply to this statement.

6. **Option E (Not Hearsay)**: The statement is being offered for its truth, which makes it hearsay. Therefore, this option is incorrect.

7. **Option F (Statement Under Belief of Impending Death)**: While the man on death row may believe his death is imminent, this exception (similar to the dying declaration) typically applies to statements about the declarant's own death, not about the victim's death. Thus, this option does not apply.

8. **Option G (Statement Made During or Immediately After the Event)**: This refers to the excited utterance exception, which applies to statements made in the heat of the moment. However, the statement in question was likely made long after the event, so this exception does not apply.

9. **Option H (Statement for Medical Diagnosis or Treatment)**: This exception applies to statements made for medical purposes, which is irrelevant here since the statement concerns a crime.

10. **Option I (Statement of Personal or Family History)**: This exception applies to statements about family history or personal background, which is unrelated to the facts of this case.

**Conclusion**: The statement is hearsay, and none of the recognized exceptions listed in the options apply. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D: hearsay not within any recognized exception.**
