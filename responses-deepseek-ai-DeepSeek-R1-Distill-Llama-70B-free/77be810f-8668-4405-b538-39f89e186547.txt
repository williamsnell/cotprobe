Okay, so I've got this math problem here about the state of Georgia. Let me see what it's asking. The question says that Georgia has 159 counties and covers 58,056 square miles. I need to find the average number of square miles per county and then round it to the nearest whole number. The options are from A to J, with various numbers.

Alright, so the first thing I think I should do is divide the total square miles by the number of counties. That makes sense because average per county would be total area divided by the number of counties.

So, the calculation would be 58,056 divided by 159. Hmm, let me try to do that division. I'm not super confident with big numbers, so I'll take it step by step.

Wait, maybe I can simplify this. Let me see if I can estimate first. 159 counties, and 58,056 square miles. Let me see, 58,000 divided by 160 is approximately 362.5 because 160 times 360 is 57,600, which is close to 58,000. But since it's 159, which is one less than 160, the result would be a bit higher, maybe around 365 or so. But wait, I'm not sure if that's accurate. Maybe I should do the exact division.

Alternatively, maybe I can break down 58,056 ÷ 159. Let me try long division. So, 159 goes into 580 how many times? Let's see, 159 times 3 is 477, and 159 times 4 is 636. 636 is more than 580, so it goes in 3 times. 3 times 159 is 477. Subtract that from 580, I get 103. Bring down the next digit, which is 0, making it 1030.

Now, how many times does 159 go into 1030? Let's see, 159 times 6 is 954, and 159 times 7 is 1,113. So 6 times. 6 times 159 is 954. Subtract that from 1030: 1030 minus 954 is 76. Bring down the next digit, which is 6, making it 766.

How about 159 into 766? Let's see, 159 times 4 is 636, 159 times 5 is 795. Oh wait, 795 is more than 766, so it's 4 times. 4 times 159 is 636. Subtract 636 from 766: 766-636=130. Bring down the next digit, which is nothing, so I guess we're done with the division here, but wait, I think I missed a digit because the original number is 58,056. Oh wait, after 580, I took 0, then 0, and then 6. So perhaps I should have brought down the 5 earlier? Hmm, maybe I messed up the digits. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Maybe I can use a calculator method since I'm just thinking through it. Alternatively, I can approximate the division.

Wait, 159 times 365: let me see, 159 * 300 is 47,700. 159 * 60 is 9,540. 159 *5 is 795. So adding those together: 47,700 +9,540 is 57,240, plus 795 is 58,035. Oh wait, that's very close to 58,056. So 159 *365 is 58,035. So the actual total is 58,056, which is 21 more than 58,035. So 365 plus (21/159) would be the exact value. 21/159 is about 0.132. So the average would be approximately 365.132 square miles per county. Rounding to the nearest whole number would make it 365.

Wait, but looking at the options, option I is 365. So that would be the answer. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might make a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe another approach: 58,056 ÷ 159. Let me see, 159 × 364 is 58,056? Let me calculate 159 × 364. 159 × 300 is 47,700. 159 × 60 is 9,540. 159 ×4 is 636. So 47,700 +9,540 is 57,240. 57,240 +636 is 57,876. Hmm, that's 57,876, which is less than 58,056. The difference is 58,056 -57,876 = 180. So 159 × 364 is 57,876. Then, 57,876 + 159 =58,035, which is 159 ×365. As before, 58,035 is 21 less than 58,056. So 365 is the exact quotient with a remainder of 21. So 365.132... which rounds to 365.

So the average is 365 square miles per county. Looking back at the options, I is 365. So the correct answer should be I.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Another way: let's compute 58,056 ÷ 159.

I can write this as 58056 ÷ 159.

Let me compute 159 × 365 as I did earlier, which equals 58,035. The difference is 58,056 -58,035 =21. So 365 with a remainder of 21, so 365.13, which rounds to 365.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator-like approach.

Wait, 159 × 366 is 58,194, which is higher than 58,056. So 365 is correct.

So the answer is I: 365 square miles per county.

To determine the average number of square miles per county in Georgia, we divide the total area (58,056 square miles) by the number of counties (159). 

Performing the division:

\[
\frac{58,056}{159} \approx 365.13
\]

Rounding 365.13 to the nearest whole number gives us 365. Among the provided options, the correct answer is:

I: 365 square miles per county.
