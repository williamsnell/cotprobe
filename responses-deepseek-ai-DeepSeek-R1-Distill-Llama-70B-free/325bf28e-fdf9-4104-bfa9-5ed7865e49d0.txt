Question:

You drive a beat-up pickup truck along a straight road for $8.4 \mathrm{~km}$ at $70 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{h}$, at which point the truck runs out of gasoline and stops. Over the next $30 \mathrm{~min}$, you walk another $2.0 \mathrm{~km}$ farther along the road to a gasoline station.
What is your overall displacement from the beginning of your drive to your arrival at the station?

Options:

A: 9.4 km
B: 10.0 km
C: 12.0 km
D:  10.4 km
E: 11.4 km
F: 7.4 km
G: 6.4 km
H: 12.4 km
I: 8.4 km
J: 13.4 km

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the overall displacement. Hmm, let's see what the question says. 

So, the scenario is that I'm driving a pickup truck along a straight road. I drive for 8.4 kilometers at a speed of 70 km/h. Then the truck runs out of gas and stops. After that, I walk for 30 minutes and cover another 2.0 kilometers to get to a gasoline station. The question is asking for my overall displacement from the start of the drive to when I arrive at the station.

Alright, displacement. I remember that displacement is the straight-line distance from the starting point to the ending point, regardless of the path taken. So it's a vector quantity, and direction matters, but in this case, since everything is along a straight road, the direction is the same.

Wait, but wait. The problem is all in a straight line, so I can just add the distances, right? Because displacement is the total change in position.

So first, I drive 8.4 km. Then I walk 2.0 km in the same direction. So the total displacement should be 8.4 + 2.0, which is 10.4 km. But let me make sure I'm not missing anything here.

Let me think about each part. The driving part: 8.4 km at 70 km/h. Oh wait, the time taken to drive isn't really relevant here because the problem is only asking about displacement, not velocity or time. So I can ignore the 70 km/h part for calculating displacement.

Then, the walking part: 30 minutes is 0.5 hours. But again, the problem gives the distance walked as 2.0 km. So whether I walked fast or slow doesn't matter because the displacement is just the 2.0 km. 

So the total displacement is the sum of the two distances since both are in the same direction along the straight road. 8.4 + 2.0 equals 10.4 km. 

Looking at the options, option D is 10.4 km. So that's the correct answer. 

I don't think I'm missing anything here. Displacement isn't concerned with the time or the speed, just the straight-line distance from start to finish. So yeah, adding them together makes sense.

To determine the overall displacement, we need to calculate the straight-line distance from the starting point to the endpoint, as displacement is a vector quantity that depends only on the initial and final positions, not the path taken.

1. **Driving Segment**: You drive 8.4 km along a straight road. This directly contributes to your displacement.
2. **Walking Segment**: After the truck stops, you walk an additional 2.0 km in the same direction. This also contributes to your displacement.

Since both segments are in the same direction, the total displacement is the sum of these two distances:

\[
\text{Total Displacement} = 8.4 \, \text{km} + 2.0 \, \text{km} = 10.4 \, \text{km}.
\]

Thus, the overall displacement from the beginning of your drive to your arrival at the station is **10.4 km**.

The correct answer is:

**D: 10.4 km**
