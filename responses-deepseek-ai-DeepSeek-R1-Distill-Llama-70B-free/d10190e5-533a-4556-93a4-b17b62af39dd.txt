Okay, so I've got this limit problem to solve using Taylor's Approximation Theorem. The problem is to find the limit as x approaches 0 of (e^(x⁴/2) - cos(x²)) divided by x⁴. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on Taylor series, but I think I can figure this out.

First, I remember that Taylor's theorem allows us to approximate functions around a point, usually x=0, using their derivatives. The idea is to expand each function in the numerator up to the necessary term so that when we subtract and divide by x⁴, things will simplify.

Let me start by considering each part of the numerator separately: e^(x⁴/2) and cos(x²).

For e^y, where y is some function of x, the Taylor series expansion around y=0 is 1 + y + y²/2! + y³/3! + ... So when y is x⁴/2, substituting that in gives:

e^(x⁴/2) = 1 + (x⁴/2) + (x⁴/2)^2 / 2! + (x⁴/2)^3 / 3! + ... 

But since x is approaching 0, higher powers of x will become negligible. So I probably don't need terms higher than x^4 because the denominator is x^4. Wait, let me think. Let's expand up to x^4 and see.

So expanding e^(x⁴/2) up to x⁴ terms: 

The first term is 1. Then, the next term is (x⁴/2). The next term is (x⁴/2)^2 / 2! which is (x^8/4) / 2 = x^8 / 8. But x^8 is a higher power, so for x near 0, this term is much smaller than x^4. So when I subtract and divide by x^4, this term and higher can probably be ignored.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. Since the denominator is x^4, any term in the numerator beyond x^4 would become negligible as x approaches 0. So, for e^(x⁴/2), I can approximate it as 1 + (x⁴/2) + ... because higher terms are insignificant.

Now, moving on to cos(x²). The Taylor series for cos(z) around z=0 is 1 - z²/2! + z^4/4! - z^6/6! + ... So substituting z = x², we get:

cos(x²) = 1 - (x²)^2 / 2! + (x²)^4 / 4! - ... 

Simplifying each term:

= 1 - x^4 / 2! + x^8 / 4! - ...

Again, as x approaches 0, x^8 and higher terms are negligible, so I can approximate cos(x²) as 1 - x^4 / 2! + ... which is 1 - x^4 / 2 + ... 

Wait, 2! is 2, so yes, that's correct.

Now, let's plug these approximations back into the numerator:

e^(x⁴/2) - cos(x²) ≈ [1 + (x⁴/2)] - [1 - (x^4 / 2)] 

Wait, let me expand that:

= 1 + x⁴/2 - 1 + x^4/2 

Because subtracting the second term: [1 - x^4/2 + ... ] becomes -1 + x^4/2 when subtracted.

So 1 cancels with -1, and we have x⁴/2 + x^4/2 = x^4.

So the numerator becomes approximately x^4.

Then, the expression is (x^4) / x^4 = 1. So the limit as x approaches 0 is 1.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me double-check because I might have made a mistake. Let me re-express each expansion more carefully.

For e^(x⁴/2):

e^y = 1 + y + y²/2 + y^3/6 + ... where y = x^4/2.

So e^(x⁴/2) = 1 + (x^4/2) + (x^4/2)^2 / 2 + (x^4/2)^3 /6 + ... 

Which is 1 + x^4/2 + x^8/(8) + x^{12}/(48) + ... 

Similarly, cos(x²) = 1 - (x^4)/2 + (x^8)/24 - ... 

So when subtracting, numerator becomes:

[1 + x^4/2 + x^8/8 + ... ] - [1 - x^4/2 + x^8/24 - ... ]

= 1 - 1 + x^4/2 - (-x^4/2) + x^8/8 - x^8/24 + higher terms.

Simplify term by term:

1 -1 =0.

x^4/2 - (-x^4/2) = x^4/2 + x^4/2 = x^4.

x^8/8 - x^8/24 = (3x^8 - x^8) /24 = (2x^8)/24 = x^8/12.

So numerator is x^4 + x^8/12 + ... 

So when we divide by x^4, we get (x^4 + x^8/12 + ... ) / x^4 = 1 + x^4/12 + ... 

As x approaches 0, x^4 terms go to 0, so the limit is 1.

Wait, but wait, the options include J as 1.0, so that would be the answer.

But let me think again. Did I make a mistake in the expansion?

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider more terms for better accuracy, but wait, when I did the first approximation, I stopped at x^4 for both, perhaps truncating too early.

Wait, let me try expanding e^(x^4/2) and cos(x²) each up to x⁴ terms.

e^(x^4/2) = 1 + (x^4/2) + (x^8/8) + ... 

But for the numerator, when subtracting cos(x²), which is 1 - (x^4)/2 + (x^8)/24 - ... 

So e^(x^4/2) - cos(x²) = [1 + x^4/2 + x^8/8 + ...] - [1 - x^4/2 + x^8/24 - ...]

= (1-1) + (x^4/2 + x^4/2) + (x^8/8 - x^8/24) + ... 

= 0 + x^4 + ( (3x^8 - x^8) /24 ) + ... 

= x^4 + (2x^8)/24 + ... 

= x^4 + x^8/12 + ... 

So when we divide by x^4, we get 1 + x^4/12 + ... 

As x approaches 0, the x^4 term goes to zero, so the limit is 1.

Looking at the options, J is 1.0, which should be the answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused now because I thought maybe I missed something. Let me make sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using more precise expansions, but this seems correct. So the limit is 1.0, option J.

To solve the limit problem using Taylor's Approximation Theorem, we approximate the functions in the numerator, \( e^{\frac{x^4}{2}} \) and \( \cos(x^2) \), around \( x = 0 \), and then simplify the expression.

### Step 1: Taylor series expansion of \( e^{\frac{x^4}{2}} \)
The Taylor series for \( e^y \) around \( y = 0 \) is:
\[
e^y = 1 + y + \frac{y^2}{2!} + \frac{y^3}{3!} + \dots
\]
Substituting \( y = \frac{x^4}{2} \), we get:
\[
e^{\frac{x^4}{2}} = 1 + \frac{x^4}{2} + \frac{\left(\frac{x^4}{2}\right)^2}{2!} + \dots = 1 + \frac{x^4}{2} + \frac{x^8}{8} + \dots
\]
For \( x \to 0 \), higher-order terms (like \( x^8 \)) are negligible, so:
\[
e^{\frac{x^4}{2}} \approx 1 + \frac{x^4}{2}.
\]

### Step 2: Taylor series expansion of \( \cos(x^2) \)
The Taylor series for \( \cos(z) \) around \( z = 0 \) is:
\[
\cos(z) = 1 - \frac{z^2}{2!} + \frac{z^4}{4!} - \dots
\]
Substituting \( z = x^2 \), we get:
\[
\cos(x^2) = 1 - \frac{(x^2)^2}{2!} + \frac{(x^2)^4}{4!} - \dots = 1 - \frac{x^4}{2} + \frac{x^8}{24} - \dots
\]
For \( x \to 0 \), higher-order terms (like \( x^8 \)) are negligible, so:
\[
\cos(x^2) \approx 1 - \frac{x^4}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Subtract the expansions in the numerator
The numerator is \( e^{\frac{x^4}{2}} - \cos(x^2) \). Substituting the approximations:
\[
e^{\frac{x^4}{2}} - \cos(x^2) \approx \left(1 + \frac{x^4}{2}\right) - \left(1 - \frac{x^4}{2}\right).
\]
Simplifying:
\[
e^{\frac{x^4}{2}} - \cos(x^2) \approx 1 + \frac{x^4}{2} - 1 + \frac{x^4}{2} = x^4.
\]

### Step 4: Divide by \( x^4 \)
The given expression is:
\[
\frac{e^{\frac{x^4}{2}} - \cos(x^2)}{x^4}.
\]
Substituting the result from Step 3:
\[
\frac{e^{\frac{x^4}{2}} - \cos(x^2)}{x^4} \approx \frac{x^4}{x^4} = 1.
\]

### Step 5: Take the limit as \( x \to 0 \)
As \( x \to 0 \), the higher-order terms (if any) vanish, and the limit is:
\[
\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{e^{\frac{x^4}{2}} - \cos(x^2)}{x^4} = 1.
\]

### Final Answer:
The limit is 1.0, which corresponds to option **J**.
