Okay, so I've got this logic problem to solve, and I'm going to try to work through it step by step. Let me see what it's asking. 

The question is about constructing a complete truth table for two propositions and then determining their logical relationship. The propositions are ~(J ∨ K) · L and (L ⊃ J) · K. Then, using the truth tables, I need to figure out if they're logically equivalent, contradictory, consistent, or inconsistent. The options are given from A to J, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, I'll break down each proposition to understand what they mean.

The first proposition is ~(J ∨ K) · L. Let me parse this. The ~ is negation, so it's the negation of (J OR K), and then AND with L. So in logical terms, this would be (NOT (J OR K)) AND L. 

The second proposition is (L ⊃ J) · K. The ⊃ symbol represents implication, so this is (L implies J) AND K. 

I think the first step is to construct the truth tables for each proposition. Since there are three variables involved (J, K, L), the truth table will have 2^3 = 8 rows.

Let me list all possible truth values for J, K, L:

1. J=T, K=T, L=T
2. J=T, K=T, L=F
3. J=T, K=F, L=T
4. J=T, K=F, L=F
5. J=F, K=T, L=T
6. J=F, K=T, L=F
7. J=F, K=F, L=T
8. J=F, K=F, L=F

Now, for each row, I'll compute the value of each proposition.

Starting with the first proposition: ~(J ∨ K) · L.

Let's break it down. First, compute J ∨ K, then negate it, then AND with L.

For each row:

Row 1: J=T, K=T
J ∨ K = T; ~ becomes F. Then F AND L (which is T) is F. So proposition 1 is F.

Row 2: J=T, K=T
Same as above: J∨K=T, ~ is F. L=F. F AND F is F.

Row 3: J=T, K=F
J∨K = T, ~ is F. L=T. F AND T is F.

Row 4: J=T, K=F
Same as row 3: J∨K=T, ~F. L=F. F AND F=F.

Row 5: J=F, K=T
J∨K=T, ~F. L=T. F AND T=F.

Row 6: J=F, K=T
Same as row 5: J∨K=T, ~F. L=F. F & F=F.

Row 7: J=F, K=F
J∨K=F, ~ is T. L=T. T & T=T.

Row 8: J=F, K=F
J∨K=F, ~ is T. L=F. T & F=F.

So the first proposition's truth values are:

Row 1: F
Row 2: F
Row 3: F
Row 4: F
Row 5: F
Row 6: F
Row 7: T
Row 8: F

Now, the second proposition: (L ⊃ J) · K.

This is (L implies J) AND K.

First, compute L⊃J, which is equivalent to (¬L ∨ J). Then AND with K.

Let me compute for each row:

Row 1: L=T, J=T. L⊃J is T. K=T. So T AND T = T.

Row 2: L=F, J=T. L⊃J is T. K=T. T & T=T.

Row 3: L=T, J=T. L⊃J=T. K=F. T & F=F.

Row 4: L=F, J=T. L⊃J=T. K=F. T & F=F.

Row 5: L=T, J=F. L⊃J is F (because T implies F is F). K=T. F & T=F.

Row 6: L=F, J=F. L⊃J=T (because F implies anything is T). K=T. T & T=T.

Row 7: L=T, J=F. L⊃J=F. K=F. F & F=F.

Row 8: L=F, J=F. L⊃J=T. K=F. T & F=F.

So the second proposition's truth values are:

Row 1: T
Row 2: T
Row 3: F
Row 4: F
Row 5: F
Row 6: T
Row 7: F
Row 8: F

Now, I need to compare the two propositions across all rows.

First proposition (P1): [F, F, F, F, F, F, T, F]

Second proposition (P2): [T, T, F, F, F, T, F, F]

Looking for when P1 and P2 have the same truth values, to check equivalence. If they match in all rows, they're equivalent. If they are opposite in all rows, they're contradictory.

Looking row by row:

Row 1: P1=F vs P2=T → different.
Row 2: P1=F vs P2=T → different.
Row 3: F vs F → same.
Row 4: F vs F → same.
Row 5: F vs F → same.
Row 6: F vs T → different.
Row 7: T vs F → different.
Row 8: F vs F → same.

So in some rows they are same, others different. So they are not logically equivalent, nor are they contradictory (since they are not opposite in all rows).

Now, to determine if they are consistent or inconsistent. Consistent means there's at least one row where both are true. Inconsistent would mean that in all rows, they can't both be true at the same time.

Looking for any row where P1=T and P2=T. 

Looking at P1's truth: only row 7 is T. In row 7, P2 is F. So in no row are both P1 and P2 true. 

Wait, no. Let me check again. P1 in row 7 is T, P2 in row 7 is F. So in that row, P1 is T and P2 is F.

Are there any rows where both are T? Let's see:

Looking for P1=T and P2=T.

Looking at P1's T: only row 7.

In row 7, P2 is F. So no row where both are T.

Wait wait, I think I might have made a mistake earlier in calculating P2's row 6. Let me double-check.

Row 6: L=F, J=F, K=T.

So L⊃J: F implies F is T. Then AND with K=T → T & T = T. So P2 is T in row 6.

In row 6, P1 is F, P2 is T. So no overlap where both are T.

So in all rows, there is no situation where both P1 and P2 are true. So the two propositions are inconsistent. Because there's no possible truth assignment where both are true at the same time.

Wait, but the question is whether the pair of propositions are consistent or inconsistent. So when are two propositions consistent? If there's at least one truth assignment where both are true, then they are consistent. If in no assignment both are true, then they are inconsistent.

In our case, no row has both P1 and P2 being T. So they are inconsistent.

Now, the options are:

A: Logically equivalent and inconsistent
B: Neither... but consistent
C: Logically equivalent
D: Inconsistent
E: Contradictory
F: Both contradictory and inconsistent
G: Neither contradictory nor consistent, but logically equivalent
H: Both logically equivalent and contradictory
I: Contradictory and consistent

Wait, but earlier we saw that the two propositions are not equivalent, nor contradictory. So they can't be in options that say they are equivalent or contradictory.

So looking at the options, the possible options are either D (inconsistent) or option B (neither equivalent nor contradictory, but consistent).

But wait, from our analysis, they are inconsistent because there's no row where both are true. So the answer should be D: Inconsistent.

Wait, but let me think again. The question is to determine if the statements are logically equivalent or contradictory. If neither, then determine if they are consistent or inconsistent.

So the first part: not equivalent, not contradictory. So the second part: are they consistent? Consistent would mean that there exists at least one truth assignment where both are true. But in our case, there's no such row. So they're inconsistent.

Therefore, the correct option is D: Inconsistent.

So looking at the options, option D says "Inconsistent".

So the answer is D.

To determine the relationship between the propositions ~(J ∨ K) · L and (L ⊃ J) · K, we construct their truth tables and analyze their logical properties.

### Truth Table Analysis

#### Proposition 1: ~(J ∨ K) · L
1. **Step 1**: Compute \( J \lor K \).
2. **Step 2**: Negate the result: \( \neg (J \lor K) \).
3. **Step 3**: AND with \( L \).

| J | K | L | \( J \lor K \) | \( \neg (J \lor K) \) | \( \neg (J \lor K) \cdot L \) |
|---|---|---|-------------|----------------------|----------------------------|
| T | T | T | T           | F                    | F                          |
| T | T | F | T           | F                    | F                          |
| T | F | T | T           | F                    | F                          |
| T | F | F | T           | F                    | F                          |
| F | T | T | T           | F                    | F                          |
| F | T | F | T           | F                    | F                          |
| F | F | T | F           | T                    | T                          |
| F | F | F | F           | T                    | F                          |

#### Proposition 2: (L ⊃ J) · K
1. **Step 1**: Compute \( L \implies J \), which is equivalent to \( \neg L \lor J \).
2. **Step 2**: AND with \( K \).

| J | K | L | \( L \implies J \) | \( (L \implies J) \cdot K \) |
|---|---|---|------------------|----------------------------|
| T | T | T | T                | T                          |
| T | T | F | T                | T                          |
| T | F | T | T                | F                          |
| T | F | F | T                | F                          |
| F | T | T | F                | F                          |
| F | T | F | T                | T                          |
| F | F | T | F                | F                          |
| F | F | F | T                | F                          |

### Comparison of Propositions
- **Logical Equivalence**: Two propositions are logically equivalent if their truth values match in all rows. Comparing the two propositions:
  - **Row 1**: F vs T → Different
  - **Row 2**: F vs T → Different
  - **Row 3**: F vs F → Same
  - **Row 4**: F vs F → Same
  - **Row 5**: F vs F → Same
  - **Row 6**: F vs T → Different
  - **Row 7**: T vs F → Different
  - **Row 8**: F vs F → Same

  Since the truth values do not match in all rows, the propositions are **not logically equivalent**.

- **Contradictory**: Two propositions are contradictory if their truth values are opposites in all rows. From the comparison above, this is not the case. Therefore, the propositions are **not contradictory**.

- **Consistency**: Two propositions are consistent if there is at least one row where both are true. From the truth tables:
  - **Row 1**: F vs T → Not both true
  - **Row 2**: F vs T → Not both true
  - **Row 3**: F vs F → Not both true
  - **Row 4**: F vs F → Not both true
  - **Row 5**: F vs F → Not both true
  - **Row 6**: F vs T → Not both true
  - **Row 7**: T vs F → Not both true
  - **Row 8**: F vs F → Not both true

  There is no row where both propositions are true simultaneously. Therefore, the propositions are **inconsistent**.

### Final Answer
The propositions are **inconsistent**.
