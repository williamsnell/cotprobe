Okay, so I've got this matrix here, A, which is a 3x3 matrix. All the elements are 1. I need to find its rank. Hmm, I remember that the rank of a matrix is the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns. 

Wait, so since all the rows are the same, [1,1,1], they're definitely not independent. If all rows are identical, then each row is a linear combination of the others. So, that would mean the row rank is just 1, right? Because only one row is linearly independent.

But wait, I also need to think about the columns. Each column is also [1,1,1], so same situation. All columns are the same, so column rank is also 1. Oh right, the row rank and column rank are always equal, so the matrix rank is 1.

I think that's it. So the rank should be 1. Looking at the options, D is 1. So the answer should be D.

The matrix A is a 3x3 matrix where every element is 1. To determine its rank, we evaluate the number of linearly independent rows or columns. Since all rows and columns are identical, they are not linearly independent. Thus, there is only one linearly independent row or column, making the rank of the matrix 1.

The correct answer is D.
