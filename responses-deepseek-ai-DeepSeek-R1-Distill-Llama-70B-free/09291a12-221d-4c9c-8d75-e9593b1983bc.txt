Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the ecological approach in urban sociology, and I need to figure out the right answer. Hmm, let me think about what I remember from my studies.

I recall that the ecological approach in sociology is often linked to the Chicago School. They were interested in how people adapt to their urban environments. The term "human ecology" might be relevant here. I think they looked at the city as an ecosystem where different social groups interact and compete for space and resources.

Wait, the question is asking specifically about the ecological approach in urban sociology. So what did they study? I think it's about how different social groups settle in various areas of the city and how they compete for resources. It might relate to things like migration patterns, zoning, or how neighborhoods form based on socioeconomic factors.

Looking at the options, let me go through them one by one.

Option A: Impact of city infrastructure on the local ecosystem. That sounds more like environmental science or urban planning, not the ecological approach in sociology. They might have looked at how humans impact the environment, but I'm not sure if that's the focus here.

Option B: How men and women use public spaces differently. Oh, that's more about gender studies in urban spaces. Not directly related to the ecological approach, which I think is more about broader social groupings rather than gender specifically.

Option C: Collective protests about environmental issues. That's environmental sociology or social movements. Doesn't fit the ecological approach as I remember it.

Option D: Rate of pollution in different areas. Again, more environmental science or urban geography, not the focus of the ecological approach in sociology.

Option E: Urbanization's effect on local climate. That's climatology or urban heat island effects. Not the same as the sociological approach.

Option F: Forms of wildlife on the edges of the city. This seems like urban wildlife studies, probably not what the question is about.

Option G: City size and biodiversity. That's an interesting point, but I think it's more about biology or environmental studies. The ecological approach in sociology might touch on how city size affects social structures, but I'm not sure it's about biodiversity specifically.

Option H: Architecture's influence on animal populations. That's more like urban ecology in biology, again not the sociological part.

Option I: How social groups colonize areas and compete for resources. This rings a bell. The Chicago School's ecological approach talked about succession, where different groups move into and out of neighborhoods, similar to ecological succession in nature. So they studied how different social groups colonize areas and compete for space and resources. That sounds right.

Option J: City planning's effects on water and green spaces. That's urban planning and environmental impact, not the sociological ecological approach.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be I.

The ecological approach in urban sociology, particularly associated with the Chicago School, focused on studying how social groups colonized different areas of the city and competed for resources. This perspective drew parallels with ecological succession in nature, examining how neighborhoods change as different groups move in and out over time. Among the options provided, option I best captures this concept.

Answer: I
