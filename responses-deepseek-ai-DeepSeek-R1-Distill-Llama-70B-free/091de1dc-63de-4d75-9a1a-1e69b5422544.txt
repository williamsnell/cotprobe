A contract was

Okay, so I've got this contract law question to tackle. Let's see what it's about. Alright, Berg offered to sell land to Jones for $75,000 cash. The offer was made via email on March 1. Then Jones responds by mailing a letter on March 10, saying he accepts but wants to pay $25,000 in three equal installments over three years. Berg got the letter on March 15. The question is about whether a contract was formed and when.

Hmm, I remember that contract formation involves offer, acceptance, and consideration. The offer was clear—$75k cash. Now, Jones is accepting but changing the terms regarding payment. So the key issue here is whether Jones' response is an acceptance or a counter-offer.

Wait, under the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code), which applies to sales of goods, there's something about firm offers and how modifications work. Oh, but wait, this is about land, which is real property, so maybe common law applies instead of the UCC. Right, because the UCC governs goods, not real estate.

Under common law, if the offeree changes the terms in their acceptance, that's a counter-offer. So the original offer is rejected, and the counter-offer becomes a new offer. So in this case, Jones is trying to change the payment terms from cash to installments. So that's a material change.

Wait, but wait—does the method of payment go to the heart of the agreement? Cash versus installments could be a significant term. So yes, that's a material alteration.

So when Jones sends this letter, he's not just accepting; he's proposing new terms. That would mean his letter is a counter-offer. So the original offer from Berg is no longer on the table unless Berg accepts this new term. But in this case, Berg hasn't agreed to it. So no contract is formed because the acceptance was conditional or proposed new terms.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on whether a request like this is a counter-offer or just a mere inquiry. If Jones had asked about the possibility of installments without making it a condition, maybe that's different. But here, his acceptance is conditional—he's saying I accept but I want to pay this way. So that's a conditional acceptance, which operates as a counter-offer.

So the original offer was made on March 1. Jones' response on March 10 is a counter-offer, which Berg received on March 15. So unless Berg accepts that counter-offer, there's no contract. So no contract was formed because the acceptance was not unconditional.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Not formed because the addition was a rejection. That seems correct because it's a counter-offer.

Option D: Not formed because it's a counter-offer. That also sounds correct. Wait, but A says it's a rejection. So when you make a counter-offer, it's a rejection of the original offer. So both A and D might apply.

Wait, the question is about whether a contract was formed. So when Jones sends a counter-offer, the original offer is rejected, and the counter becomes a new offer. So until Berg accepts that, there's no contract. So the answer would be that no contract was formed.

Looking at the options, A and D are both possibilities. Let me read them again.

Option A: Not formed because the addition was a rejection. So it's treating the addition as a rejection, implying that Jones rejected Berg's offer by adding terms.

Option D: Not formed because Jones' response was a counter-offer. So D is about the response being a counter-offer.

Wait, but under common law, when you have a counter-offer, it's a rejection. So the original offer is terminated. So the result is the same—no contract. So both A and D lead to the same conclusion. But the reasoning is different.

Wait, but in the scenario, Jones wrote "I accept but would like to request..." So he's trying to accept with a modification. Under common law, that's not an acceptance but a counter-offer. So the correct reasoning is that it's a counter-offer, so option D would be the reason. So the answer would be D.

Alternatively, some might think that adding a condition is a rejection, but I think the more precise answer is that it's a counter-offer. So in that case, D is the correct option.

So the answer should be D: Not formed because Jones' response was a counter-offer.

The question revolves around contract formation, specifically whether an agreement was reached between Berg and Jones. Berg offered to sell land for $75,000 cash via email on March 1. Jones responded on March 10 with a letter stating acceptance but requesting to pay $25,000 in installments over three years. Berg received this letter on March 15. The key issue is whether Jones' response constitutes an acceptance or a counter-offer.

Under common law, an acceptance must be unequivocal and mirror the terms of the offer. Jones' response, however, introduces a material change to the payment terms (cash vs. installments), which alters the original offer. This constitutes a counter-offer rather than an acceptance. A counter-offer rejects the original offer and proposes new terms, which Berg has not accepted. Therefore, no contract was formed.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. While the addition of terms could be seen as a rejection, the more precise reasoning is that it constitutes a counter-offer.
- **D**: Correct. Jones' response is a counter-offer, which rejects the original offer and proposes new terms, preventing contract formation.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**D: Not formed because Jones' response was a counter-offer.**
