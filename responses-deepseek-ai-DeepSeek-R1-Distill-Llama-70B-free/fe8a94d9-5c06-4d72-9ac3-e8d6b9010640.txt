Okay, so I've got this quantum mechanics problem here about an electron in a one-dimensional box. Hmm, I remember that the one-dimensional box model is a standard problem in quantum mechanics. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says the electron is in the state n=1, and we need to find the probability of it being in the region from 0 to L/2. The options are given, so after I figure it out, I'll match my answer to the options.

First, I recall that the wave functions for a particle in a 1D box are given by the sine functions. The general form is ψ_n(x) = sqrt(2/L) * sin(nπx/L), right? Because the particle is confined between 0 and L, and the wavefunction must go to zero at the boundaries.

Since the state is n=1, the wave function simplifies to ψ_1(x) = sqrt(2/L) * sin(πx/L). That makes sense because for n=1, the first term in the series.

The probability of finding the electron in a region is the integral of the square of the absolute value of the wavefunction over that region. Since the wavefunction is real here, it's just the integral of [ψ_1(x)]^2 dx from 0 to L/2.

So, the probability P is the integral from 0 to L/2 of (2/L) * sin²(πx/L) dx. Oh wait, because (sqrt(2/L)) squared is 2/L.

I remember that the integral of sin²(ax) dx can be simplified using a double-angle identity. The identity is sin²θ = (1 - cos(2θ))/2. So substituting that in, the integral becomes (2/L) * ∫ (1 - cos(2πx/L))/2 dx from 0 to L/2.

Simplify that. The 2/L and 1/2 multiply to 1/L. So P = (1/L) ∫ [1 - cos(2πx/L)] dx from 0 to L/2.

Now split the integral into two parts: ∫1 dx minus ∫cos(2πx/L) dx, all multiplied by 1/L.

The integral of 1 dx from 0 to L/2 is just L/2 - 0 = L/2.

The integral of cos(2πx/L) dx. Let me make a substitution. Let u = 2πx/L. Then du = (2π/L) dx, so dx = (L/(2π)) du.

So ∫cos(u) * (L/(2π)) du = (L/(2π)) sin(u) evaluated from 0 to (2π*(L/2)/L) = π.

Wait, when x is L/2, u = (2π/(L))*(L/2) )= π. So the integral becomes (L/(2π)) [sin(π) - sin(0)] = (L/(2π))(0 - 0) = 0. Oh wait, no. Wait, let me recheck that.

Wait no, when x = 0, u = 0. When x = L/2, u = π. So the integral of cos(u) from 0 to π is sin(π) - sin(0) = 0 - 0 = 0. So the second term ∫cos(...) dx becomes (L/(2π)) * 0 = 0.

So putting it together, the probability P is (1/L) [ (L/2) - 0 ] = (1/L)(L/2) ) = 1/2.

Wait, that can't be right because I remember that for n=1, the probability in the first half isn't 1/2. Or maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, no, I think I messed something up. Wait, let me redo the integral.

Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the substitution. Let me try a different approach. The integral of cos(a x) dx is (1/a) sin(a x), right? So for ∫cos(2πx/L) dx, let a = 2π/L. So integral is (L/(2π)) sin(2πx/L).

Evaluated from 0 to L/2. So at x=L/2, sin(2π*(L/2)/L) = sin(π) = 0. At x=0, sin(0)=0. So the integral from 0 to L/2 is zero. So yes, that part is zero.

So the integral becomes (1/L) [ (L/2 - 0) ] = 1/2. Wait, but I'm pretty sure the probability for n=1 in half the box is 1/2. So the probability is 1/2.

Looking at the options, option I is 1/2. So the answer would be I.

Wait, but wait a second. Another approach: the probability density for n=1 is maximum at the center, right? So the wavefunction squared is (2/L) sin²(πx/L). Since sin(πx/L) is symmetric around x=L/2. So when you integrate from 0 to L/2, you're covering half the box. But because the function isn't uniform, the integral might not be exactly half.

Wait, maybe I should compute the integral again more carefully.

Let me recompute the integral. The integral is (2/L) ∫ sin²(πx/L) dx from 0 to L/2.

Using the identity sin²θ = (1 - cos(2θ))/2, the integral becomes:

(2/L) * ∫ [1 - cos(2πx/L)] / 2 dx from 0 to L/2.

The 2 cancels with the denominator, so (1/L) ∫ [1 - cos(2πx/L)] dx from 0 to L/2.

Compute ∫1 dx from 0 to L/2: that's L/2.

Compute ∫cos(2πx/L) dx from 0 to L/2: as before, let me compute this.

Let u = 2πx/L → du = 2π/L dx → dx= L du/(2π)

Limits: when x=0 → u=0; x=L/2 → u=π.

So integral becomes ∫ cos u * (L du)/(2π) from 0 to π.

Which is (L/(2π)) [ sin u ] from 0 to π → (L/(2π)) (0 - 0) = 0.

So the total integral is (1/L) [ (L/2 - 0) ) ] = 1/2.

So the probability is indeed 1/2.

Wait, but I thought sometimes for n=1, the probability in the first half is more than half. Or maybe I'm confusing it with higher states.

Wait, the wavefunction for n=1 is symmetric around L/2. Because ψ_1(x) is sin(πx/L), which goes from 0 at 0, rises to maximum at L/2, then back to zero at L.

So the square of this function is symmetric around L/2. Therefore, the area from 0 to L/2 should be exactly half the area from 0 to L. So the integral would be 1/2.

So the correct answer is I: 1/2.

To calculate the probability of finding an electron in the region \( 0 \leq x \leq \frac{1}{2}L \) for a particle in a one-dimensional box of length \( L \) in the state \( n=1 \), we proceed as follows:

The wavefunction for a particle in a 1D box is given by:

\[
\psi_n(x) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{L}} \sin\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right),
\]

and for \( n=1 \), it simplifies to:

\[
\psi_1(x) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{L}} \sin\left(\frac{\pi x}{L}\right).
\]

The probability of finding the electron in a region is given by the integral of the square of the wavefunction over that region. Thus, the probability \( P \) of finding the electron in \( 0 \leq x \leq \frac{1}{2}L \) is:

\[
P = \int_0^{\frac{L}{2}} |\psi_1(x)|^2 dx = \int_0^{\frac{L}{2}} \frac{2}{L} \sin^2\left(\frac{\pi x}{L}\right) dx.
\]

Using the trigonometric identity \( \sin^2\theta = \frac{1 - \cos(2\theta)}{2} \), the integral becomes:

\[
P = \frac{2}{L} \int_0^{\frac{L}{2}} \frac{1 - \cos\left(\frac{2\pi x}{L}\right)}{2} dx = \frac{1}{L} \int_0^{\frac{L}{2}} \left[1 - \cos\left(\frac{2\pi x}{L}\right)\right] dx.
\]

Splitting the integral into two parts:

\[
P = \frac{1}{L} \left[\int_0^{\frac{L}{2}} 1 \, dx - \int_0^{\frac{L}{2}} \cos\left(\frac{2\pi x}{L}\right) dx\right].
\]

1. The first term evaluates to:

\[
\int_0^{\frac{L}{2}} 1 \, dx = \frac{L}{2}.
\]

2. The second term involves the integral of \( \cos\left(\frac{2\pi x}{L}\right) \). Using the substitution \( u = \frac{2\pi x}{L} \), \( dx = \frac{L}{2\pi} du \), the limits of integration change from \( x = 0 \) to \( u = 0 \) and \( x = \frac{L}{2} \) to \( u = \pi \). Thus:

\[
\int_0^{\frac{L}{2}} \cos\left(\frac{2\pi x}{L}\right) dx = \frac{L}{2\pi} \int_0^\pi \cos(u) \, du = \frac{L}{2\pi} \left[\sin(u)\right]_0^\pi = \frac{L}{2\pi} (0 - 0) = 0.
\]

Combining these results:

\[
P = \frac{1}{L} \left[\frac{L}{2} - 0\right] = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

Thus, the probability of finding the electron in the region \( 0 \leq x \leq \frac{1}{2}L \) is \( \frac{1}{2} \).

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**I: \( \frac{1}{2} \).**
