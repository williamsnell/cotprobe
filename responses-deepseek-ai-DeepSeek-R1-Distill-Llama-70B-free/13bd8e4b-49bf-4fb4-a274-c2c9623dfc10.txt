Okay, I need to find the square roots of a complex number A, which is given as 3.08 + j8.455. Hmm, right, complex numbers can have two square roots, so the answer should have two options. The choices are all in polar form, so I think I should convert the given complex number to polar form first.

First, I remember that a complex number in rectangular form is A = a + jb. To convert it to polar form, I need the magnitude r and the angle θ. The magnitude r is calculated using the formula r = sqrt(a² + b²). So let's compute that. 

a is 3.08 and b is 8.455. So a squared is approximately 3.08^2. Let me compute that: 3 squared is 9, 0.08 squared is 0.0064, and cross terms are 2*3*0.08 = 0.48. So 9 + 0.48 + 0.0064 = about 9.4864. 

b squared is 8.455^2. Let's see, 8 squared is 64, 0.455 squared is around 0.207. The cross term is 2*8*0.455 = 7.28. So adding those: 64 + 7.28 = 71.28, plus 0.207 gives about 71.487. 

So a squared plus b squared is 9.4864 + 71.487 = approximately 80.9734. The square root of that is the magnitude r. Let's calculate sqrt(80.9734). Since 9^2 is 81, which is just a bit above 80.97, so r is just a bit less than 9. Hmm, maybe around 8.995? Let me do a precise calculation. 8.995 squared is (9 - 0.005)^2 = 81 - 2*9*0.005 + (0.005)^2 = 81 - 0.09 + 0.000025 = 80.910025, which is a bit less than 80.9734. So maybe 8.996^2? Let's compute 8.996^2. 8.996 is 9 - 0.004, so (9 - 0.004)^2 = 81 - 2*9*0.004 + 0.004^2 = 81 - 0.072 + 0.000016 = 80.928016. Still a bit low. 8.997^2: 8.997 is 9 - 0.003. So (9-0.003)^2 = 81 - 0.054 + 0.000009=80.946009. Hmm, getting closer. 8.998^2: 81 - 0.072 (since 2*9*0.002=0.036, wait wait, (a - b)^2 = a² - 2ab + b². So 0.002 is b. So 2*a*b = 2*9*0.002=0.036. So 81 - 0.036 + 0.000004 = 80.964004. 80.964 is less than 80.9734. So the next, 8.999^2 is 8.999 squared. Hmm, 8.999 = 9 - 0.001, so (9-0.001)^2 = 81 - 0.018 + 0.000001 = 80.982001. Oh, that's 80.982, which is just a bit over 80.9734. So the actual r is between 8.998 and 8.999. Let me approximate it as about 8.9985. But maybe for the purposes of this problem, I can just take r as approximately 9, since the square is very close to 81. Or perhaps I'm overcomplicating, maybe the exact value isn't crucial right now because the given options have specific magnitudes.

Wait, but actually, the square roots will have a magnitude of sqrt(r). Because when taking the square root of a complex number, the magnitude of the root is the square root of the original magnitude. So if the original r is about 9, then the root's magnitude is about 3. Because 3 squared is 9. So looking at the options, the magnitudes are 4, 2, 3.5, 2.8, 3, etc. So 3 is one of the options. So perhaps the correct magnitude is 3, as in options E, F, H, I, J. So that's a clue.

Now, the angle θ. The angle is calculated using tanθ = b/a. So here, b is 8.455 and a is 3.08. So tanθ = 8.455 / 3.08. Let me compute that. 8.455 divided by 3.08. Let's see, 3.08 times 2 is 6.16, 8.455 -6.16 is 2.295. So 2.295 /3.08 = approx 0.745. So total tanθ is approx 2 + 0.745 = 2.745. So tanθ ≈ 2.745. 

What angle has a tangent of 2.745? Let me think. I know that tan(60°) is about 1.732, tan(70°) is around 2.747. Oh wait, 2.745 is very close to tan(70°). Because 70 degrees' tan is approximately 2.747, so 2.745 would be about 69.9 degrees, roughly 70 degrees. But wait, another thing: since a is positive and b is positive, the complex number is in the first quadrant, so the angle is between 0 and 90 degrees. So θ is approximately 70 degrees.

Wait a second, but let me compute it more accurately. Let me compute 8.455 / 3.08. Let me do this division properly. 3.08 goes into 8.455 how many times?

3.08 * 2 =6.16 → subtract from 8.455: 8.455 -6.16 = 2.295. Then bring down a zero: 22.95. 3.08*7 is 21.56 → 22.95-21.56=1.39. Bring down another zero: 13.9. 3.08 goes into 13.9 four times (3.08 *4=12.32). So we have 2.7 (after the decimal) so 2.745 approximately.

So tanθ ≈ 2.745 → θ ≈70 degrees. But wait, perhaps I should use a calculator for better accuracy. But since I don't have one, I'll proceed with this approximation for now.

So the polar form of A is approximately 9 ∠70°.

Now, to find the square roots of A. The square roots of a complex number in polar form (r, θ) are given by sqrt(r) ∠ (θ/2 + k*180°), where k is 0 and 1. So for the two roots, we'll have:

sqrt(r) ∠ (θ/2) and sqrt(r) ∠ (θ/2 + 180°).

So given that r is approximately 9, sqrt(r) is 3. And θ is approximately 70°, so θ/2 is 35 degrees. So the two roots are 3∠35° and 3∠(35+180)=215°. So the two roots are 3∠35° and 3∠215°. 

Looking back at the options, let's see which one matches this. Option H is 3∠35° and 3∠215°. So H seems to be the correct answer. But let me double-check the other options to make sure.

Option A: 4∠35° and 4∠215° → magnitude too big. Since sqrt(r) is 3, not 4. So A is incorrect.

Option B: 2∠40° and 220° → magnitude too small, angle a bit off. So B wrong.

Option C: 3.5∠45° and 225° → magnitude 3.5 is higher than 3, angle 45 is higher than our 35. So no.

Option D: 2.8∠33° and 213° → magnitude lower, angle a bit less. Not matching.

Option E: 3∠45° and 225° → angle higher than 35, so no.

Option F: 3∠40° and 220° → angle higher than 35, so no.

Option G: 2.5∠30° and 210° → magnitude too low.

Option H: 3∠35° and 215° → matches exactly what I found.

Option I: 3∠30° and 210° → angle lower than 35, so no.

Option J: 3∠50° and 230° → angle higher, no.

So the correct answer should be H.

To find the square roots of the complex number \( A = 3.08 + j8.455 \), it is first converted to polar form. The magnitude \( r \) is calculated as:

\[
r = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \sqrt{(3.08)^2 + (8.455)^2} \approx \sqrt{9.4864 + 71.487} \approx \sqrt{80.9734} \approx 8.9985.
\]

The angle \( \theta \) is calculated using:

\[
\theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{8.455}{3.08}\right) \approx \tan^{-1}(2.745) \approx 70^\circ.
\]

Thus, the complex number in polar form is approximately \( 9 \angle 70^\circ \).

The square roots of a complex number in polar form \( (r, \theta) \) are given by:

\[
\sqrt{r} \angle \left(\frac{\theta}{2} + k \cdot 180^\circ\right), \quad k = 0, 1.
\]

Here, \( \sqrt{r} = \sqrt{9} = 3 \), and \( \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{70^\circ}{2} = 35^\circ \). Therefore, the two square roots are:

\[
3 \angle 35^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad 3 \angle (35^\circ + 180^\circ) = 3 \angle 215^\circ.
\]

Comparing this result with the given options:

- **Option A**: \( 4 \angle 35^\circ \) and \( 4 \angle 215^\circ \) → Magnitude is too large (should be 3).
- **Option B**: \( 2 \angle 40^\circ \) and \( 2 \angle 220^\circ \) → Magnitude is too small, and the angle is incorrect.
- **Option C**: \( 3.5 \angle 45^\circ \) and \( 3.5 \angle 225^\circ \) → Magnitude is too large, and the angle is incorrect.
- **Option D**: \( 2.8 \angle 33^\circ \) and \( 2.8 \angle 213^\circ \) → Magnitude is too small, and the angle is slightly off.
- **Option E**: \( 3 \angle 45^\circ \) and \( 3 \angle 225^\circ \) → Angle is too large.
- **Option F**: \( 3 \angle 40^\circ \) and \( 3 \angle 220^\circ \) → Angle is too large.
- **Option G**: \( 2.5 \angle 30^\circ \) and \( 2.5 \angle 210^\circ \) → Magnitude is too small, and the angle is incorrect.
- **Option H**: \( 3 \angle 35^\circ \) and \( 3 \angle 215^\circ \) → Matches the calculated result exactly.
- **Option I**: \( 3 \angle 30^\circ \) and \( 3 \angle 210^\circ \) → Angle is too small.
- **Option J**: \( 3 \angle 50^\circ \) and \( 3 \angle 230^\circ \) → Angle is too large.

The correct answer is **Option H**: \( 3 \angle 35^\circ \) and \( 3 \angle 215^\circ \).
