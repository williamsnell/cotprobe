Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about calculating the cost of lumber. Let's see what the question says. The cost is $140 per 1,000 board feet. I need to find the charge for 300 pieces of lumber with specific dimensions.

Hmm, board feet... I remember that board feet is a unit of volume, right? So I think the formula for board feet is (thickness x width x length) divided by 12, since it's in inches and feet. Wait, no, wait—wait, no, let me think again. Oh right, board feet is calculated by (thickness in inches * width in inches * length in feet), and then you divide by 12 because there are 12 inches in a foot. Or wait, maybe it's (t * w * l) / 12. Yeah, I think that's right.

So each piece of lumber here is 2 inches thick, 6 inches wide, and 12 feet long. Let me plug those numbers in. So for one piece, the board feet would be (2 * 6 * 12) / 12? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check the calculation again. Oh wait, wait—wait, no. The formula is (t * w * l) / 12. So t is 2 inches, w is 6 inches, l is 12 feet. So 2*6=12, 12*12=144, then 144 divided by 12 is 12 board feet per piece. Oh, right, because 12 feet is the length, but the other dimensions are in inches, so dividing by 12 converts inches to feet.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Because board feet is calculated as the volume in cubic inches divided by 144 (since there are 144 cubic inches in a board foot). Alternatively, if the length is in feet, and the width and thickness in inches, then the formula is (t * w * length_in_feet) * (1/12), because 1 foot is 12 inches. So yeah, so (2 * 6 * 12) / 12. Let's compute that. 2 times 6 is 12, multiplied by 12 is 144. 144 divided by 12 is 12 board feet per piece. So each piece is 12 board feet.

Wait, that seems high. Let me check another way. If I have a piece that's 2" x 6" x 12', converting that to inches for all dimensions: 2 inches thick, 6 inches wide, and 144 inches long (since 12 feet is 144 inches). Volume is 2 * 6 * 144 = 1728 cubic inches. Now, since 1 board foot is 144 cubic inches (12x12x12?), wait no, 12x12x1 inch foot? Wait, 12 inches in a foot, so 12" x 12" x 1" is 144 cubic inches. So 1728 / 144 = 12 board feet per piece. Yep, same answer. So each piece is 12 board feet.

So for 300 pieces, the total board feet is 300 * 12 = 3600 board feet.

Now, the cost is $140 per 1,000 board feet. So how much is 3600 board feet? Let's compute that.

First, 3600 / 1000 = 3.6. So 3.6 * 140 = ?

140 * 3 is 420, 140 * 0.6 is 84. So 420 +84= 504. So the total cost is $504.

Looking at the options, option C is $504. So the answer should be C.

To calculate the cost of the lumber, we first determine the board footage per piece. The formula for board feet is:

\[
\text{Board Feet} = \frac{\text{Thickness (inches)} \times \text{Width (inches)} \times \text{Length (feet)}}{12}
\]

Given the dimensions:
- Thickness = 2 inches
- Width = 6 inches
- Length = 12 feet

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Board Feet per piece} = \frac{2 \times 6 \times 12}{12} = 12 \, \text{board feet per piece}
\]

For 300 pieces, the total board footage is:

\[
\text{Total Board Feet} = 300 \times 12 = 3600 \, \text{board feet}
\]

The cost of lumber is $140 per 1,000 board feet. Therefore, the cost for 3600 board feet is:

\[
\text{Cost} = \frac{3600}{1000} \times 140 = 3.6 \times 140 = 504
\]

Thus, the total charge for the lumber is **$504**.

The correct answer is **C**.
