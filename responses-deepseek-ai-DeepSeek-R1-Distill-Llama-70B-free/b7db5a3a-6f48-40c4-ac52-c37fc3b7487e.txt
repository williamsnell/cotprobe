Okay, so I have this question about who made a specific statement about law. The statement is: "Law consists of a set of principles or body of rules recognized and applied by the State in the administration of justice." The options are A through J, each corresponding to different legal theorists or writers.

First, I need to figure out who among these options is known for that particular definition. I remember that different legal philosophers have their own takes on what law is. Let me try to recall each one's main ideas.

Option A is Blackstone. I think Blackstone wrote Commentaries on the Laws of England. He viewed law as something derived from reason and custom, part of the natural law tradition maybe. Not sure if he said exactly those words.

Option B is Bentham. He was a utilitarian and the founder of modern positivism. He talked about law as commands and the role of the sovereign. But I don't recall the exact wording here.

Option C is Gray. There's a John Chipman Gray, I think, who wrote The Nature and Sources of the Law. His view was more about law as a statement of the customary morality of the community. Not sure if that's the quote.

Option D is Austin. Austin is known for his command theory. He said law is the command of the sovereign, enforced by sanctions. That's a bit different from the given statement because it focuses on the sovereign's command rather than the state administering justice.

Option E is Kelsen. Kelsen's Pure Theory of Law posits that law is a hierarchical system of norms. He focused on the basic norm. The statement doesn't ring a bell with Kelsen's structure.

Option F is Dworkin. He argued against legal positivism, emphasizing that law isn't just rules but includes principles. His theory includes rights and principles, but the wording doesn't exactly match.

Option G is Salmond. I'm not too familiar with Salmond, but I think he might have written about jurisprudence. Maybe he discussed the nature of law in a way that includes state administration.

Option H is H.L.A. Hart. Hart's concept is about the union of primary and secondary rules. He talks about law as a system of rules, but the exact quote isn't coming to me right now.

Option I is Roscoe Pound. He was a sociological jurist, focusing on law and society. I don't think he defined law in those exact terms.

Option J is Holland. Thomas Erskine Holland wrote about jurisprudence and the elements of jurisprudence. I think he might have said something about law being a body of rules recognized by the state. That sounds familiar, but I'm not 100% sure.

Wait, the statement mentions law as principles or rules recognized and applied by the state. Austin's command theory is about the sovereign, but this is more about the state administering justice. I think it was either Gray, Salmond, or Holland.

Let me think again. Gray's definition was more about law as a body of principles declared by courts. Salmond, in his Jurisprudence, might have said something like law is a body of rules. Alternatively, Holland's definition could be similar.

Alternatively, I remember that John Austin's definition is "law is the command of the sovereign". So that's not it. So maybe it's Gray or Salmond.

Wait, the question says "recognized and applied by the State". That makes me think of someone who emphasized the state's role in law. Austin's sovereign is a bit different because it's a person or group, not the state as an entity.

I think Gray defined law as "the body of principles recognized and applied by the state in the administration of justice." Wait, no, that's the exact quote from the question. So Gray might be the answer.

But earlier I thought about Gray's view being about customary morality. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe it's someone else.

Wait, another thought: I think the exact quote is from Thomas Erskine Holland. He wrote in his book "The Elements of Jurisprudence" that law is "a body of principles recognized and applied by the state in the administration of justice." So that would make the answer J: Holland.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Another angle: John Chipman Gray's definition was "Law is the body of principles...". Alternatively, maybe it's John Salmond. Wait, I should try to remember.

Alternatively, I've heard that Salmond's definition was "Law is the body of principles recognized and applied by the State in the administration of justice." That sounds exactly like the quote. So then the answer would be G: Salmond.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting information in my mind. I think I need to clarify.

Let me try to recall: John Salmond's Jurisprudence. Yes, I think he defined law as "the body of principles recognized and applied by the state in the administration of justice." So the answer would be G.

But wait, another possibility: Holland's definition in his Elements of Jurisprudence says, "Law is a body of principles...". Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the two.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is G: Salmond. Because I remember that Salmond's definition is similar to that.

Wait, but another angle: Blackstone's Commentaries start with "Law... is a rule...". But that's not the exact wording.

Alternatively, the answer could be G: Salmond. Because I've read that before.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think of another approach. The statement in the question is: "Law consists of a set of principles or body of rules recognized and applied by the State in the administration of justice."

This seems to align with a definition that includes both principles and rules, and the role of the state. Salmond's definition is "Law is the body of principles recognized and applied by the state in the administration of justice." So that's almost exactly the quote, except the quote uses 'set of principles or body of rules' which might be slightly different wording.

Alternatively, maybe it's Gray. Gray's definition is often stated as "Law is the body of principles...". So perhaps the quote is from Gray.

Wait, but I'm not sure. I think I might have this mixed up. Another thought: perhaps it's John Austin, but his definition is about the command of the sovereign, which doesn't fit the quote.

Wait, another approach: looking up the exact quote. But since I can't do that, I have to rely on memory.

I think the correct answer is G: Salmond. Because I remember that Salmond's definition is close to that. Alternatively, maybe it's Gray.

Wait, another thought: the quote uses 'set of principles or body of rules'. So it's combining both. Salmond's definition refers to principles, whereas someone else might refer to rules.

Wait, perhaps the answer is J: Holland. Because in his Elements of Jurisprudence, he defines law as "a body of general rules...". But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, I've heard that the definition given in the question is from Salmond. So I'll go with G: Salmond.

The question asks who made the statement: "Law consists of a set of principles or body of rules recognized and applied by the State in the administration of justice." To determine the correct answer, the analysis considers the definitions of law proposed by various legal theorists and philosophers.

- **Option A (Blackstone):** Blackstone's work focuses on law as derived from reason and custom, but his definition does not match the exact wording of the statement.
- **Option B (Bentham):** Bentham, a utilitarian, viewed law as commands of the sovereign, which differs from the statement's focus on the state administering justice.
- **Option C (Gray):** John Chipman Gray defined law as "the body of principles declared by courts," which is close but does not fully align with the statement.
- **Option D (Austin):** Austin's command theory emphasizes the sovereign's role, not the state's administration of justice, making it inconsistent with the statement.
- **Option E (Kelsen):** Kelsen's Pure Theory of Law focuses on a hierarchical system of norms, which does not match the statement.
- **Option F (Dworkin):** Dworkin emphasized law as including principles and rights, but his theory does not align with the exact wording.
- **Option G (Salmond):** Salmond's definition of law as "the body of principles recognized and applied by the State in the administration of justice" closely matches the statement.
- **Option H (H.L.A. Hart):** Hart's theory of primary and secondary rules does not align with the statement.
- **Option I (Roscoe Pound):** Pound's sociological jurisprudence does not match the statement.
- **Option J (Holland):** Holland's definition of law as "a body of general rules" is somewhat similar but does not fully align with the statement.

After careful consideration, the statement aligns most closely with Salmond's definition, which emphasizes the state's role in administering justice through principles and rules. Therefore, the correct answer is:

G
