Okay, so I've got this physics question in front of me about nuclear reactions, specifically fission and fusion. Hmm, I remember from my classes that both of these processes release energy, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think this through step by step.

The question is asking about what happens to mass during these processes. The options are A to J, but I'll focus on the relevant ones. So, the question is: In both fission and fusion, energy is released while mass... ?

Wait, I remember something about Einstein's equation here. E=mc², right? So energy and mass are interchangeable. When energy is released, that means some mass is being converted into energy. But wait, how does that work exactly in fission and fusion?

Fission is when a heavy nucleus splits into two or more smaller nuclei, releasing a lot of energy in the process. Fusion is the opposite—when two light nuclei combine to form a heavier one, also releasing energy. Oh, right, both processes release energy because the resulting nuclei have a lower mass than the original ones. So the mass difference is what's converted into energy.

But wait, the question is about what happens to mass. So in both cases, the total mass decreases because some of it is turned into energy. So mass decreases. Let me look at the options.

Option H is "decreases." Option A is "disappears completely"—that doesn't sound right because only a small amount of mass is converted, not all of it. Option B is about converting into light and heat, which is more about the energy part, not the mass. Option F says mass remains unchanged, which I don't think is correct because mass does change. Option H seems to fit here.

Wait, let me make sure. In fission, the original heavy nucleus (like Uranium) splits into smaller nuclei, and the total mass of the products is less than the original. The difference (mass defect) is the energy released via E=mc². Similarly, in fusion, when two nuclei combine, the resulting nucleus has a smaller mass than the sum of the originals. So mass decreases in both cases, meaning the correct answer should be H.

I don't think any of the other options fit. So the answer must be H: decreases.

In both nuclear fission and fusion, energy is released due to a conversion of mass into energy, as described by Einstein's equation \( E = mc^2 \). In fission, a heavy nucleus splits into smaller nuclei, and the total mass of the products is less than the original mass. Similarly, in fusion, two light nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus, but the resulting mass is still less than the sum of the original nuclei. This difference in mass, known as the mass defect, is converted into energy. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A (disappears completely):** Incorrect, as only a small amount of mass is converted into energy, not all of it.
- **B (is converted into light and heat):** This describes the energy release but not the fate of mass.
- **F (remains unchanged; is conserved):** Incorrect, as mass decreases in both processes.
- **H (decreases):** Correct, as the mass of the system decreases due to the conversion of a portion of it into energy.

Thus, the correct answer is **H: decreases**.

Answer: H
