The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

At a defendant's trial for burglary, the defendant has called a witness who has testified without objection that the defendant said shortly after his arrest, "They've got the wrong person for this, because I have an alibi." The prosecutor seeks to cross- examine the witness about why she did not mention that statement when the police asked her whether the defendant had said anything to her about having an alibi. Is the prosecutor's proposed cross-examination proper?

Options:

A: Yes, as a way to establish the witness's relationship with the defendant.
B: No, because the prosecutor cannot introduce evidence that contradicts the defendant's statement.
C: Yes, as a method to challenge the witness's credibility.
D: No, because the witness's failure to mention the alibi is not relevant.
E: Yes, as a way to question the witness's memory.
F: No, because the prosecutor cannot cross-examine the defendant's witness.
G: Yes, as impeachment for prior inconsistency.
H: No, because the witness's failure to mention the alibi is collateral and ambiguous.
I: Yes, as impeachment for bias and interest.
J: No, because the witness's character for truthfulness cannot be attacked by specific instances of conduct.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically dealing with cross-examination and impeachment of a witness. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is a burglary trial. The defendant has called a witness who testified that the defendant said, "They've got the wrong person for this, because I have an alibi," shortly after his arrest. The prosecutor wants to cross-examine the witness about why she didn't mention this statement when the police asked if the defendant had said anything about an alibi.

I remember that in evidence law, when a witness testifies, the opposing party can cross-examine them. One of the key areas in cross is challenging the witness's credibility. There are specific rules about what you can ask about on cross.

So, the witness made a statement in court about the defendant's alibi. But when the police asked her before, she didn't mention it. The prosecutor wants to ask her why she didn't mention it back then.

I think this relates to prior inconsistent statements. Usually, if a witness says something different before trial than they do on the stand, the opposing side can use that to impeach their credibility. But wait, there are conditions.

Wait, the prior statement has to be inconsistent with the current testimony. Here, the witness's current testimony includes the defendant's alibi statement. The prior was not mentioning it. So, the prior omission might be used to suggest that the witness's current testimony isn't reliable because she didn't bring it up earlier.

I recall that under the Federal Rules of Evidence, specifically Rule 613, you can impeach a witness with a prior inconsistent statement. But there's a catch: if the prior statement was made under oath and subject to perjury, you have to give the witness a chance to explain or deny it, and the circumstances must be similar enough.

Wait, in this case, the prior statement was made to the police, not under oath perhaps? Or maybe it's not under oath. So, maybe Rule 613 allows using it for impeachment by showing the inconsistency.

Wait, but another point: the question is about cross-examining the witness about why she didn't mention it. So the prosecutor isn't introducing the prior statement as substantive evidence but using it to challenge her credibility.

So, the issue is whether the prosecutor can ask about the prior omission to impeach the witness's credibility. I think yes, because prior inconsistent statements or omissions can be used to challenge credibility.

Looking at the options:

Option C says it's a method to challenge credibility. That seems right.

Option G says it's impeachment for prior inconsistency. That's also possible.

Option E is about questioning memory, which is a bit different. The prosecutor is suggesting maybe the witness forgot, but the real issue is inconsistency.

Wait, but what's the difference between challenging credibility generally (option C) and impeachment for prior inconsistency (option G)?

I think that prior inconsistent statements are a specific way to challenge credibility. So option G would be more precise. But I need to think about the rules.

Rule 613 allows for impeachment by prior inconsistent statements. So the prosecutor can ask about the prior statement to show inconsistency, thereby impeaching the witness's credibility.

So, if the witness didn't mention the alibi when asked by police, that's an omission that's inconsistent with her current testimony. So the prosecutor can use that to impeach.

So the proposed cross-examination is proper because it's a prior inconsistent statement used for impeachment.

Looking back at the options, option G says "Yes, as impeachment for prior inconsistency." That fits.

Alternatively, option C is about challenging credibility, which is a broader category. But the specific method here is prior inconsistency, making G the better answer.

Other options: Option A is about relationship with defendant, which isn't the point here. Option B says prosecutor can't contradict, which is incorrect because impeachment is allowed. Option D says it's irrelevant, but credibility is always relevant. Option E is about memory, which isn't the main issue. Option F is wrong because you can cross-examine your own witness. Option H says it's collateral and ambiguous. Wait, what's collateral? If the issue is about a fact that's collateral, extrinsic evidence isn't allowed. But here, the statement goes to credibility, so it's not collateral. Or wait, maybe the prosecutor can't go into extrinsic evidence on a collateral matter.

Wait, wait. When you impeach a witness, you can ask about prior inconsistent statements on cross, but you can't introduce extrinsic evidence unless it's a prior conviction or something. So, for example, if the witness made a prior statement, you can ask them about it on cross, but you can't bring in another witness to testify about it unless it's a specific exception.

In this case, the prosecutor is asking the witness about her prior omission. That's allowed under Rule 613. So it's proper.

So the correct answer is G.

Another option to consider is option J, which says you can't attack truthfulness with specific instances. But I think that's about a witness's character, not specific prior statements. Rule 608(b) allows specific instances of conduct to attack credibility if they relate to truthfulness, but it's for the opposing party's witness. Wait, but in this case, it's the defendant's own witness. Does that matter?

No, because when you call a witness, the other side can still impeach them. So J is not the right reason here. The issue is prior inconsistency, not attacking character for truthfulness with specific acts.

So I think the answer is G.

The question revolves around whether the prosecutor's proposed cross-examination of the defendant's witness is proper. The witness testified that the defendant made a statement about having an alibi, but she did not mention this statement when previously questioned by the police. The prosecutor seeks to ask her why she omitted it, which raises issues of credibility and prior inconsistency.

Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, specifically Rule 613, a witness may be impeached with a prior inconsistent statement to challenge their credibility. Here, the witness's omission of the alibi statement when questioned by the police is inconsistent with her current testimony. This inconsistency can be used to impeach her credibility, as it suggests that her testimony may not be reliable.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option C** states that the cross-examination is a method to challenge the witness's credibility. While this is true, it is a broader category, and the specific issue here is prior inconsistency.
- **Option G** specifically identifies the cross-examination as impeachment for prior inconsistency, which aligns directly with the facts and the applicable rule.

Other options are incorrect because they either mischaracterize the issue (e.g., Options A, B, D, E, F, H, J) or fail to address the specific legal principle at play. The correct answer is **Option G**, as the prosecutor's proposed cross-examination is proper to impeach the witness's credibility based on her prior inconsistent statement.

Answer: G
