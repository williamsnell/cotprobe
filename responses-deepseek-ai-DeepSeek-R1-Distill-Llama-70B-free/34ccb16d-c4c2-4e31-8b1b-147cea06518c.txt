Alright, so I've got this question here about the TV show "My Three Sons." The question is asking which of the boys on the show is adopted. The options are A through J, with names like Danny, Sam, Charlie, etc. I'm a bit fuzzy on my classic TV shows, but I'll try to think this through.

First, I remember that "My Three Sons" was a popular sitcom that aired from the early '60s into the '70s. The show revolved around a widowed father, Steve Douglas, raising his three sons. The main character, Steve, was played by Fred MacMurray. I think the show had a few cast changes over the years, especially with the sons growing up and new characters being introduced.

Now, the question is specifically about which son was adopted. I recall that the show had a few sons, and at some point, one of them was adopted. Let me try to remember their names. The original sons, I think, were Mike, Robbie, and Chip. Wait, no, maybe Chip came later. Oh right, the original three were Mike, Robbie, and the youngest, maybe it was Chip? Or was there another name?

Wait, I think the sons were Mike, Robbie, and a third whose name I'm not totally sure of. Then, later in the series, they introduced another son, perhaps Ernie, who was the adopted one. I think Ernie was the adopted child because I remember an episode where they explained that he was adopted. So, if the options include Ernie, that might be the answer.

Looking at the options, option D is Ernie. Let me double-check. The other names: I know Robbie was one of the original sons, and Mike was the eldest. Then there was Chip, who was the youngest initially, but I think later on, when the show needed to refresh the cast, they added Ernie, who was Steve's adopted son. So, that would make Ernie the adopted one.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I also remember that the show had a daughter at some point, but I think that was after the sons had grown up. No, that's probably another show. So, focusing back, the adopted son was Ernie.

So, the answer should be D: Ernie.
