Question:

The Experimental Company is now producing and selling 17,000 units of product per year at a sales price of $250 each. It has had a profit objective of 20 percent return on a $2,000,000 investment. Its present cost structure is as follows: Manufacturing costs: Fixed costs $400,000 per year Variable costs $175 per unit produced Selling and administration expenses: Fixed expenses $135,000 per year Variable expenses $25 per unit sold Ten hours are required to produce a unit of product. The company is interested in pushing its rate of operations to 100 percent of its capacity-20,000 units of product. It believes that it can raise its price by up to 5 percent of the present sales price without cutting its present sales volume. In addition, it believes that it can increase its sales to productive capacity with minor design and quality improvements that will increase variable manufacturing costs by $5 per unit, and with accompanying promotion that will increase its variable selling and administration expenses by $5 per unit for all units sold. The company would like to achieve a profit objective of 25 percent on its investment. REQUIRED: 1) Can the company, within the price increase limitation indicated, achieve its new profit objective by reaching full utilization of capacity with the increased variable costs and expenses required? 2) What would the sales price have to be to achieve the new profit objective? 3) What sales price would achieve the old profit objective?

Okay, so I've got this question here about the Experimental Company trying to meet a new profit objective. Hmm, let me try to break this down. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll do my best.

Alright, let's read the problem again. The company is currently producing and selling 17,000 units at $250 each. Their profit objective was a 20% return on a $2,000,000 investment, but now they want to achieve 25%. They want to know if they can meet this new objective by increasing production to 20,000 units, which is 100% capacity. 

So, the cost structure is a bit detailed. Let's see: manufacturing has fixed costs of $400,000 a year and variable costs of $175 per unit. Selling and admin have fixed expenses of $135,000 and variable of $25 per unit. Oh, and each unit takes 10 hours to produce, but maybe that's extra info for now.

They want to push to 20,000 units. To do that, they might have to increase the price by up to 5% without losing sales. Also, if they go to full capacity, they'll have some changes: variable manufacturing costs go up by $5 per unit, and variable selling/admin expenses go up by $5 per unit for all units sold.

The first question is whether they can achieve the new profit objective (25% ROI) within the 5% price increase. Second, what price is needed for the new objective, and third, what price for the old objective.

Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that ROI is calculated as (Net Income / Investment) * 100. The investment is $2,000,000. The desired ROI is 25%, so Net Income needed is 25% of 2 million, which is $500,000.

Wait, no, wait. Actually, ROI is often calculated as Net Income divided by Investment. So for 25%, Net Income should be 0.25 * 2,000,000 = $500,000. That's the target profit.

But wait, the old profit objective was 20%, which would be $400,000 profit. So now they want to go higher.

Next, to get to 20,000 units, they have to adjust their costs. Their variable costs go up by $5 per unit in manufacturing and another $5 in selling/admin. So per unit, the variable costs increase by $10.

But they can also increase the price by up to 5%. The current price is $250, so 5% is $12.50. So new price could be up to $262.50. But maybe they don't need to go that high, depending on costs.

Wait, but the options have prices like $260.50, etc., so I'll need to calculate exactly.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Calculate the required Net Income for 25% ROI: $500,000.
2. Determine the new cost structure when producing 20,000 units:
   - Fixed manufacturing costs remain $400,000.
   - Variable manufacturing costs per unit increase by $5, so new variable is $175 + $5 = $180.
   - Fixed selling/admin costs remain $135,000.
   - Variable selling/admin per unit increase by $5, so new variable is $25 + $5 = $30.
3. Calculate total costs at 20,000 units with new variables.
4. Calculate total revenue with the new price (which is to be determined).
5. Set up the equation: Revenue - Total Costs = Required Net Income ($500,000).
6. Solve for the price.

Let me compute each part.

First, Total Costs = Fixed Costs + Variable Costs.

Fixed Costs: $400,000 (manufacturing) + $135,000 (S&A) = $535,000.

Variable Costs per unit: $180 (manufacturing) + $30 (S&A) = $210 per unit.

At 20,000 units, variable costs = 20,000 * $210 = $4,200,000.

So total costs = $535,000 + $4,200,000 = $4,735,000.

Revenue = Price per unit * 20,000 units.

We need Revenue - Total Costs = $500,000.

So Revenue = $4,735,000 + $500,000 = $5,235,000.

Price per unit = $5,235,000 / 20,000 = $261.75.

Wait, but the maximum they can increase the price is 5%, which would be $250 * 1.05 = $262.50. $261.75 is less than that, so yes, they can achieve the new profit objective within the price increase limitation.

So the answer to question 1 is yes.

Now, question 2 is the required sales price to achieve the new profit objective, which is $261.75.

Question 3 asks for the sales price to achieve the old profit objective of 20% ROI, which is $400,000.

Let me compute that.

Again, same cost structure when producing 20,000 units. So total costs are $4,735,000 as before.

Desired Net Income is $400,000.

So Revenue = $4,735,000 + $400,000 = $5,135,000.

Price per unit = $5,135,000 / 20,000 = $256.75.

Wait, but wait - the old profit objective might be when they're producing 17,000 units, not 20,000. Wait no, the question says for the old profit objective, what's the price? Hmm, let me read the question again.

Oh, the third question says: What sales price would achieve the old profit objective? So the old profit objective is 20% on the same $2 million investment, which is $400,000 profit.

But wait, when they are operating at full capacity (20,000 units), with the increased variable costs, what's the price needed to get the old profit. Hmm, but I think I might have misread question 3. Maybe question 3 is about what's the price if they don't change anything except the price, but I'm not sure.

Wait, no, the question says: What sales price would achieve the old profit objective? So perhaps, under the new cost structure (since they're increasing production to 20k), but wanting the same old profit of 20% ($400k). So using the same calculations as above, the price would be $256.75.

Wait, but let me make sure.

Alternatively, if they're still at 17,000 units, but maybe that's not the case. The problem says they're pushing to 20k units. So in any case, when they're at 20k with increased variable costs, the required price for 20% ROI would be $256.75.

Wait, looking at the options, I see option B has $257.50 as first value, which is close to my 261.75, but wait no, my first calculation was 261.75, which is the price for the new profit objective. Then the second part is 256.75, which matches with an option perhaps.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option B: $257.50, $258.75/unit, $252.00/unit.

Wait, but 257.50 is higher than my 256.75. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Total costs at 20,000 units:

Fixed: 400k + 135k = 535k.

Variable per unit: 175+5=180 (manufacturing), 25+5=30 (S&A). Total variable per unit: 210.

Total variable costs: 20,000 * 210 = 4,200,000.

Total costs: 4,200,000 + 535,000 = 4,735,000. Correct.

For new profit objective (25% ROI):

Net Income = 500,000.

Revenue needed: 4,735,000 + 500,000 = 5,235,000.

Price per unit: 5,235,000 / 20,000 = 261.75.

So that's question 2's answer.

Question 3: Old profit objective (20% ROI) is 400,000 Net Income.

Revenue needed: 4,735,000 + 400,000 = 5,135,000.

Price per unit: 5,135,000 /20,000 = 256.75.

But looking at the options, I don't see 256.75 as an option. Wait, let's look.

Options:

A: 258, 259.5, 253

B: 257.5, 258.75, 252

C: 269, 269.5, 263

D: 262.5, 261.75, 255

E: 255.5, 262.75, 265

F: 267.5, 268, 262.5

G: 270, 270.5, 265

H: 263.5, 264, 258.5

I: 265.5, 265.75, 260

J: 260.5, 260.75, 250

Hmm, none of the options have 256.75 for the third part. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps the third question is not about producing 20,000 units but at a different production level. Let me re-examine the question.

Wait, the question says for question 3, what sales price would achieve the old profit objective. But the old profit objective was when they were selling 17,000 units. So perhaps I need to compute based on 17,000 units, without the increased variable costs.

Wait, that makes more sense. Because the old profit was at 17k units without the changes. So perhaps question 3 is about the old scenario, not the new one.

Wait, let me re-read the problem statement.

The company is interested in pushing to 20k units. They can increase price by 5% without cutting sales. Also, if they go to full capacity, variable costs increase by $5 each, and selling expenses by $5 each.

So, for the current situation (17k units, price 250), their costs are:

Manufacturing: 400k fixed + 175 per unit.

S&A: 135k fixed +25 per unit.

If they decide to not change anything, but just raise the price to achieve the old profit, maybe that's what question 3 is asking.

Wait, the problem says:

Question 3: What sales price would achieve the old profit objective?

The old profit objective was 20% on 2 million, which is 400k.

So, what's the required price to get 400k profit, but under the new conditions (i.e., producing 20k units with increased variable costs), or under the old conditions (producing 17k units)?

Hmm, the problem isn't entirely clear, but I think the way it's worded, question 3 is about the old profit objective, which would be when they were selling 17,000 units. So perhaps the costs are the old variable costs, not the increased ones.

Alternatively, maybe the question is about after expanding to 20k units but wanting to get back to the old profit. I'm a bit confused. Let me think again.

No, the initial situation is 17k units, then they want to go to 20k. So the first part (question 1) is about whether, with the increased variable costs, can they achieve the new profit objective of 25% by raising the price up to 5%.

Question 2 is the price needed for the new objective (25% ROI), which we found as 261.75.

Question 3 is the price needed to achieve the old profit objective (20% ROI), which might be under the new conditions (20k units and increased costs), but perhaps in that case, the required price would be lower.

Wait, but if they're at 20k units with higher variable costs, to get 20% ROI, that would require a lower price than what's needed for 25%. But when I calculated earlier, I got 256.75. However, none of the options have that.

Alternatively, perhaps question 3 is about the original scenario: 17,000 units, without the increased variable costs, and what price would be needed to achieve the old 20% ROI, which they were already doing. But that wouldn't make sense because they were already at that profit. So maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the old profit objective is 20% ROI when they are selling at 17k units. So their current situation gives them that profit. So the price to achieve the old objective is the current price, which is $250. But that can't be right because when they go to 20k units, their costs change.

Wait, perhaps I should consider both scenarios.

Let me clarify each question.

Question 1: Can they, by raising the price up to 5% (to $262.50), achieve the new profit objective (25% ROI) when producing at 20k units with the increased variable costs.

As I calculated, the required price is $261.75, which is within the 5% limit, so yes.

Question 2: What is the required price? $261.75.

Question 3: What price would achieve the old profit objective (20% ROI), which is $400k.

If they are producing 20k units with the increased costs, then the required price would be $256.75, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, if they're not changing production (staying at 17k units), but considering the increased costs? No, because the increased costs only happen when they go to 20k.

Alternatively, perhaps question 3 is about the old profit without any changes, meaning at 17k units with the original variable costs.

Let me compute that.

At original 17k units:

Manufacturing fixed: 400k.

Manufacturing variable: 175 *17,000 = 2,975,000.

S&A fixed: 135k.

S&A variable: 25*17,000=425,000.

Total costs: 400k + 2,975k + 135k + 425k = 3,835,000.

Revenue needed: 3,835,000 + 400,000 (20% ROI) = 4,235,000.

Price per unit: 4,235,000 /17,000 ≈ 249.12. But that's below the current price of 250. Hmm, that can't be right because they're already selling at 250 and making the 20% profit.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me recheck.

Wait, their current situation is selling 17,000 units at $250 each, which is revenue of 17,000 * 250 = 4,250,000.

Their costs are:

Manufacturing: 400k + (175 *17k) = 400k + 2,975k = 3,375k.

S&A: 135k + (25 *17k) = 135k + 425k = 560k.

Total costs: 3,375k + 560k = 3,935k.

Profit: 4,250k - 3,935k = 315k.

Wait, 315k is their current profit. But 20% of 2 million is 400k. Wait, that's a problem. So they're not meeting their old profit objective currently. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, perhaps the old profit was when they were making 20% ROI, so maybe their current operations aren't at that yet.

Wait, the problem states that they "have had a profit objective of 20 percent return on a $2,000,000 investment." So perhaps their current operations are not achieving that yet. So when they are producing 17k units, their costs and revenues don't reach that 20% yet.

Wait, let's compute their current profit.

Revenue: 17,000 * 250 = 4,250,000.

Manufacturing costs: 400,000 + (17,000 * 175) = 400k + 2,975k = 3,375k.

S&A costs: 135k + (17,000 *25) = 135k + 425k = 560k.

Total costs: 3,375k + 560k = 3,935k.

Profit: 4,250k - 3,935k = 315k.

ROI is 315k / 2,000k = 15.75%, which is below 20%. So they want to increase their ROI to 25% by expanding to 20k units and adjusting prices.

So back to question 3: What sales price would achieve the old profit objective (20% ROI) of $400k.

I think this refers to the new scenario of producing 20k units but wanting to achieve the old ROI. So with the increased variable costs.

As before, total costs at 20k units: 4,735,000.

Desired profit: 400k.

Revenue needed: 4,735k + 400k = 5,135k.

Price per unit: 5,135,000 / 20,000 = 256.75.

Looking at the options again, none have 256.75 as an answer for part 3. The closest is option B's third value, 252, or option D's 255. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the cost calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that when they increase production to 20k, their variable costs go up only for the additional units beyond 17k. Wait, no, the problem says that with the increased production, variable manufacturing costs increase by $5 per unit, and variable S&A by $5 per unit for all units sold. So all 20k units have the higher variable costs.

So perhaps my earlier calculation was correct, but the options don't match. Alternatively, maybe I should check if the fixed costs change, but the problem states that fixed costs remain the same.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation for question 3. Let me recalculate.

Total costs at 20k units:

Fixed: 400k + 135k = 535k.

Variable per unit: (175+5) + (25+5) = 180 +30=210.

Total variable: 20,000 *210=4,200k.

Total costs: 535k +4,200k=4,735k.

Desired profit for old objective: 400k.

So revenue needed: 4,735k +400k=5,135k.

Price per unit:5,135k /20k=256.75.

But none of the options have 256.75 for part 3. Hmm. Let me check the options again.

Option B: price2=258.75, price3=252.

Option D: price2=261.75,
