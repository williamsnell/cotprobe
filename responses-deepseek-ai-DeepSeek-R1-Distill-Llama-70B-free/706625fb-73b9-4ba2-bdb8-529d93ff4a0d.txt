Okay, so I have this physics problem about calculating the inversion density for a helium-neon laser. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the question gives me some parameters. The laser operates at a wavelength of 6328 Angstroms, which I think is 632.8 nanometers. The gain constant is 2% per meter. Oh wait, I think that's the gain per unit length. The temperature is 100 degrees Celsius, which is pretty hot, and the lifetime of the upper state is 1e-7 seconds, which is 10 nanoseconds.

Wait, inversion density... Oh right, I remember that inversion density relates to the population difference between the upper and lower energy states. The formula I think is something like n_j - n_i, and it's related to the gain coefficient.

The formula for gain (g) is given by g = (λ² / (8πτ)) * (n_j - n_i) / (c), wait no, that doesn't sound right. Or maybe it's g = (n_j - n_i) * (λ² A) / (8π c), where A is the Einstein coefficient for spontaneous emission. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, Einstein's A coefficient is related to the lifetime τ. Oh right, A = 1/τ. Because the lifetime is the inverse of the transition rate.

Let me try to write down the formula. The gain coefficient (g) is proportional to the population inversion (Δn = n_j - n_i) times the Einstein A coefficient and some other factors involving wavelength and speed of light. Let me think.

I think the formula is g = (λ² * A * Δn) / (8π c), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, another formula I recall is Δn = (8π c g) / (λ² A). Yeah, that makes sense because solving for Δn would involve those terms.

Let me get all the given values in SI units.

First, the wavelength λ. 6328 Angstrom is 6328e-10 meters, which is 6.328e-7 meters.

The gain constant g is 2% per meter. So 0.02 m^-1.

The temperature is 100°C, which is 373.15 K. But wait, do I need the temperature for this calculation? Oh, wait, maybe I don't because the formula doesn't directly involve temperature unless it's about the Boltzmann distribution or partition functions, but I think this problem gives all the necessary data without needing to calculate the population distribution. So maybe the temperature is a red herring here, or perhaps I'm missing something.

The lifetime τ is 1e-7 seconds.

So the Einstein A coefficient is A = 1/τ = 1e7 s^-1.

Now plug into the formula. Let me write it again:

Δn = (8π c g) / (λ² A)

Let's compute each term.

Compute 8π: approximately 25.1327.

c is the speed of light, about 3e8 m/s.

g is 0.02 m^-1.

λ is 6.328e-7 m.

A is 1e7 s^-1.

So let's plug in all the numbers.

Δn = (25.1327 * 3e8 * 0.02) / ( (6.328e-7)^2 * 1e7 )

Let me compute numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: 25.1327 * 3e8 = approx 7.5398e9. Multiply by 0.02 gives 1.50796e8.

Denominator: (6.328e-7)^2 = approx 4.005e-13 m². Multiply by 1e7 s^-1 → 4.005e-6 m²/s.

So denominator is 4.005e-6.

So Δn ≈ 1.50796e8 / 4.005e-6 → Let's compute that.

1.50796e8 / 4.005e-6 → approximately 3.76e13 per m³.

Wait, that's 3.76e13, but looking at the options, the highest is 8e19. Hmm, I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, wait, let me recalculate. Maybe I messed up the exponents.

Let me compute numerator and denominator more carefully.

Numerator: 8π c g = 8 * π * 3e8 m/s * 0.02 m^-1.

Compute constants: 8 * π ≈ 25.1327.

25.1327 * 3e8 = 7.5398e9.

Multiply by 0.02 → 7.5398e9 * 0.02 = 1.50796e8.

Denominator: (λ)^2 * A = (6.328e-7 m)^2 * 1e7 s^-1.

Compute λ squared: (6.328e-7)^2 = (6.328)^2 * (1e-14) → approx 40.05 * 1e-14 = 4.005e-13 m².

Multiply by A=1e7 s^-1 → 4.005e-13 *1e7 = 4.005e-6 m²/s.

So Δn = numerator / denominator = (1.50796e8 ) / (4.005e-6 )

Compute 1.50796e8 = 1.50796 x 10^8.

Divide by 4.005e-6 → 1.50796e8 /4.005e-6 = (1.50796 /4.005) ) * (1e8 / 1e-6 )

1.50796 /4.005 ≈ 0.3765.

1e8 / 1e-6 = 1e14.

So 0.3765e14 → 3.765e13 m^-3.

Wait, but the options are all on the order of 1e19 or 1e18. So I'm getting about 3.76e13, but the options are much higher. That suggests I made a mistake in the formula or calculations.

Hmm. Wait, perhaps I used the wrong formula. Let me double-check the formula for gain in terms of population inversion.

Another approach: The gain coefficient g is related to the population inversion Δn by the formula:

g = (λ² / (8π τ c)) * Δn

Wait, that's because A = 1/τ, so substituting that in. So rearranged, Δn = (8π τ c g) / λ².

Wait, that's different from what I did earlier. Let me try this.

Δn = (8 π τ c g) / λ².

So let's compute this.

τ = 1e-7 s.

c=3e8 m/s.

g =0.02 m^-1.

λ=6.328e-7 m.

So:

8 * π ≈25.1327.

25.1327 * τ = 25.1327e-7.

Multiply by c: 25.1327e-7 *3e8 = 25.1327 *3 *1e1 → because 1e-7 *1e8=1e1.

25.1327 *3 ≈75.3981, so 75.3981e1 = 753.981.

Multiply by g=0.02: 753.981 * 0.02 ≈15.0796.

Divide by λ squared: λ² = (6.328e-7)^2 =4.005e-13 m².

So Δn = 15.0796 / 4.005e-13 → 15.0796 /4.005e-13.

Wait, 15.0796 is 1.50796e1.

So 1.50796e1 /4.005e-13 = (1.50796/4.005) *1e(1+13) → (≈0.3765) *1e14 →3.765e13 m^-3.

Same result as before. Hmm. So I'm getting 3.76e13 per m^3, but the options are in the 1e19 range. That can't be right. So I must have a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I forgot to account for something else. Like maybe the statistical weight or the degeneracy of the states? Or maybe I got the formula wrong.

Wait, another formula I found in my notes: The gain coefficient is given by g = (n_j -n_i) * σ, where σ is the stimulated emission cross-section. And σ can be expressed as (λ² A)/(8π c), assuming no line broadening.

So σ = (λ² A)/(8π c). Thus, g = Δn * σ = Δn * (λ² A)/(8π c).

Wait, so rearranging gives Δn = g *8π c/(λ² A).

Wait, that's the same as the first formula I used. So that gives the same result as before.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the gain constant given is per meter, but perhaps in terms of small signal gain, other factors are involved, like the length of the medium.

Wait, no, the gain per unit length is given as 2% per meter, so that's 0.02 m^-1. So that should be correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in units. Let me check the units of each term.

In the formula Δn = (8π c g) / (λ² A).

c is m/s, g is m^-1, λ is m, A is s^-1.

So units:

( m/s * m^-1 ) / (m^2 * s^-1 ) → ( (m/s) * (1/m) ) ) → (1/s) → numerator is (1/s) * 8π.

Denominator: m² * s^-1 → m²/s.

So overall units: (1/s) / (m²/s) ) → 1/m². Wait, that can't be right. Because population inversion is per volume, so units should be m^-3.

Hmm, that suggests I have an error in the formula.

Wait, let me think. The correct formula for gain is g = (n_j -n_i) * (σ), and σ is the cross-section. And σ is given by (λ² A)/(8π c). So the units of σ should be m^2.

Yes, because cross-section has units of area.

So the formula for σ is (λ² A)/(8π c), so units:

λ is m, so λ² is m².

A is s^-1.

c is m/s.

So σ has units (m² * s^-1 )/( (m/s) ) ) → (m² s^-1) * s/m → m.

Wait, that's not correct. Hmm, maybe I'm getting tangled in the units.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula in terms of the lifetime τ, because A = 1/τ.

So let me try expressing everything in terms of τ.

Another formula I found is:

Δn = (g * c * τ) / (λ²) * (8π)

Wait, or perhaps Δn = (g * 8π c τ) / λ².

Wait, let's try that.

So Δn = (g * 8 π c τ) / (λ²).

Plugging in the numbers:

g = 0.02 m^-1.

c=3e8 m/s.

τ=1e-7 s.

λ=6.328e-7 m.

Compute numerator: 0.02 *8π*3e8 *1e-7.

Calculate 8π ≈25.1327.

0.02 *25.1327 ≈0.50265.

0.50265 *3e8 = 1.50795e8.

1.50795e8 *1e-7 = 1.50795e1 =15.0795.

Denominator: (6.328e-7)^2 =4.005e-13 m².

So Δn=15.0795 /4.005e-13 → 15.0795 /4.005e-13 ≈3.76e13 m^-3.

Same result again. So why am I getting 3.76e13 when the options are all 1e18 or higher?

Wait, perhaps I missed a factor from the formula. Maybe the formula includes a factor related to the refractive index or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a factor involving the speed of light or the wavelength in a different way. Wait, another possible formula is:

Δn = (g * τ) / (h c /λ^3 )

Wait, because the spontaneous emission rate A is 1/τ, and sometimes it's written in terms of h c /λ^3 or similar terms.

Let me think of the relation between A and wavelength.

The Einstein A coefficient is given by A = (1/τ) = (8 π h c)/(λ^3) * (1/ (c^2)) ) ? Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, the Einstein A coefficient for spontaneous emission is given by:

A = ( (8 π h c) / λ^3 ) * ( (g_i)/(g_j) ) * (1/ τ )

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me think differently.

The spontaneous emission rate A is given by A = (1/τ) = ( (8 π h c) / (λ^3) ) * (f) ), where f is the oscillator strength or something similar. But maybe that's complicating things.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula for gain includes the ratio of the statistical weights, or perhaps I missed a factor of the speed of light somewhere.

Wait, maybe I should consider the formula in terms of the cross-section σ. σ = (λ^2 / (8 π c)) * (A/Δν), where Δν is the linewidth. Hmm, but without knowing Δν, that might not be helpful.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for inversion density is n = (g c τ) / ( (8 π) (λ^2) )

Wait, but I tried that and got 3.76e13.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be Δn = (g * c * τ) / ( (8 π) (λ^2) )

Wait, let's compute that.

g=0.02 m^-1.

c=3e8 m/s.

τ=1e-7 s.

λ=6.328e-7 m.

So numerator: g*c*τ = 0.02 *3e8 *1e-7.

0.02 *3e8 =6e6.

6e6 *1e-7=6e-1=0.6.

Denominator: 8 π λ^2 =25.1327*(6.328e-7)^2.

Compute (6.328e-7)^2=4.005e-13 m².

25.1327 *4.005e-13 ≈1.0065e-11.

So Δn=0.6 /1.0065e-11 → approx 5.96e11 m^-3.

Still not matching the options, which are around 1e19. So I'm missing something big here.

Wait, maybe the gain constant is given per meter, but perhaps the actual gain involves more than that. Or perhaps I'm not considering the correct formula.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the gain constant is given as 2% per meter, but that's actually the small signal gain coefficient, which is related to the population inversion. But perhaps the formula requires the gain per unit length to be in units of m^-1, which is correct.

Wait, maybe I should check the formula in a textbook. Wait, I can't do that right now, but I'll try to think.

Wait, I found this formula in some notes: For a four-level system, the population inversion is given by Δn = n_j = (g * λ^2 * τ) / (8 π c).

Wait, let's try that.

So Δn = (g * λ^2 * τ) / (8 π c).

Plugging the numbers in:

g=0.02 m^-1.

λ=6.328e-7 m.

τ=1e-7 s.

c=3e8 m/s.

Compute numerator: 0.02 * (6.328e-7)^2 *1e-7.

(6.328e-7)^2= approx 4.005e-13.

Multiply by 1e-7: 4.005e-20.

Multiply by 0.02: 8.01e-22.

Denominator:8 π c=25.1327 *3e8≈7.5398e9.

So Δn=8.01e-22 /7.5398e9 = approx 1.06e-31 m^-3.

That can't be right. So definitely, this formula isn't correct.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Maybe I should look for another approach. Let's think about the relation between gain, cross-section, and population inversion.

The gain coefficient g is given by g = σ * Δn, where σ is the stimulated emission cross-section.

The cross-section σ can be expressed using the Einstein A coefficient: σ = (λ^2 A) / (8 π c). And since A = 1/τ, σ = (λ^2) / (8 π c τ).

So substituting back, g = (λ^2 Δn) / (8 π c τ).

Rearranging for Δn: Δn = (g *8 π c τ) / λ^2.

Which brings me back to the same formula as before. So Δn = (8 π c τ g) / λ².

Plugging in the numbers again:

8 π ≈25.1327.

c=3e8 m/s.

τ=1e-7 s.

g=0.02 m^-1.

λ=6.328e-7 m.

Compute numerator: 25.1327 *3e8 *1e-7 *0.02.

25.1327 *3e8 =7.5398e9.

7.5398e9 *1e-7 =7.5398e2.

7.5398e2 *0.02=0.150796.

Denominator: (6.328e-7)^2=4.005e-13 m².

So Δn=0.150796 /4.005e-13 = approx 3.76e12 m^-3.

Wait, earlier I thought it was 3.76e13, but now it's 3.76e12. Wait, no, wait:
