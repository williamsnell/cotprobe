Okay, so I've got this problem about a non-Newtonian power-law fluid flowing through a heated tube, and I need to find the outlet bulk temperature. Hmm, non-Newtonian fluids can be a bit tricky because their viscosity depends on the shear rate, right? But let's try to break this down step by step.

First, let's list out the given data to make sure I don't miss anything. The flow rate is 650 lbm/hr. The entering temperature is 100°F. The inside wall temperature is 200°F. The density is 65 lbm/ft³, specific heat is 0.5 Btu/lbm°F, and thermal conductivity is 0.7 Btu/hr·ft·°F. The flow property constants are n' = 0.4, and k is given at two different temperatures: 80 lbm·s^(n-2)·ft^-1 at 117.5°F and 40 at T_w=200°F. The tube's internal diameter is 1/12 ft, so that's 0.0833... feet, and the length is 7.4 ft.

Wait, I think I remember that for non-Newtonian fluids in laminar flow, the heat transfer coefficient can be calculated using some specific correlations. Oh right, the Graetz problem for laminar flow in tubes, but adapted for power-law fluids. The general approach involves determining the heat transfer coefficient, then using an energy balance to find the outlet temperature.

But wait, power-law fluids have the consistency index 'k' and the power-law index 'n''. The viscosity for a power-law fluid is given by μ = k * (du/dy)^(n'-1). But since we're dealing with heat transfer, maybe the Prandtl number equivalent comes into play, but for power-law fluids, I think it's called the Prandtl number analog or something similar.

Hmm, the first thing I need to calculate is the Reynolds number for the flow. Wait, no, for non-Newtonian fluids, it's the generalized Reynolds number, Re*. The formula for Re* is (D^n * V^(2-n) * rho) / k, where D is the diameter, V is the average velocity, rho is density, and k is the consistency index. But wait, I'm a bit confused about the exact formula. Let me think.

Wait, the generalized Reynolds number is Re* = (rho * V^2 * D^n) ) / (k * (3n +1 + n)/4n)^(n/(n'+1)) ))? No, maybe that's for the power-law index in a different context. Alternatively, perhaps it's Re* = (D^(n) * V^(2-n) * rho) ) / k. I think that's the correct expression.

But wait, what's V here? V is the average velocity in the tube. So first, I need to find the average velocity. The mass flow rate is 650 lbm/hr. The density is 65 lbm/ft³. So the volumetric flow rate Q is mass flow rate divided by density.

So Q = 650 / 65 = 10 lbm/(hr·ft³) * hr? Wait, no, wait, units. Mass flow rate is 650 lbm/hr. Density is 65 lbm/ft³. So Q = 650 / 65 = 10 lbm·ft³ / hr. But wait, 1 ft³ is 1 lbm density, so 65 lbm/ft³ means 1 ft³ weighs 65 lbm. So 650 lbm/hr divided by 65 lbm/ft³ gives 10 ft³/hr. That makes sense. So Q is 10 ft³/hr.

The cross-sectional area A of the tube is π D²/4. D is 1/12 ft, so A = π*(1/12)^2 /4. Let me calculate that. (1/12)^2 is 1/144, divided by 4 is 1/576. So A = π/(576) ≈ 0.00545 ft².

So average velocity V is Q/A. Q is 10 ft³/hr, so V = 10 / 0.00545 ≈ 1834 ft/hr. Wait, that's a huge number. Let me check the units again. Oh wait, ft³ per hour divided by ft² gives ft/hr, which is correct.

But maybe I should convert ft/hr to something else, like ft/s. 1834 ft/hr ÷ 3600 s/hr ≈ 0.509 ft/s. That seems more reasonable.

Now, calculating Re*. The formula is Re* = (rho * V^2 * D^n) ) / (k * (3n +1 +n)/4n) )^(n/(n'+1)) ))? Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, perhaps for a power-law fluid, the generalized Reynolds number is Re* = (D^(n) * V^(2-n) * rho) ) / k. Let me confirm this.

Yes, I think the correct formula for the generalized Reynolds number is Re* = (rho * V^(2-n) * D^n) ) / k. So let's plug the numbers in.

rho is 65 lbm/ft³. V is 0.509 ft/s. D is 1/12 ft. n is 0.4. k is given as 80 lbm·s^(n-2)·ft^{-1} at 117.5°F. Wait, but the wall temperature is 200°F, not 117.5. Oh, so k varies with temperature. Hmm, that complicates things because the fluid's properties change with temperature. But perhaps for this problem, we can take k as given, maybe at the average temperature. Or wait, perhaps the problem assumes k for the fluid at the average temperature.

Wait, the problem gives k at two different temperatures. At 117.5°F, k=80, and at 200°F, k=40. Since the fluid is entering at 100°F, and the wall is at 200°F, the fluid will heat up as it flows through the tube. So the k value will change along the tube. But how do I handle that?

This seems complicated because the viscosity (or the consistency index) is temperature-dependent, which affects the flow properties. But maybe the problem simplifies this by assuming that k is evaluated at the average bulk temperature. Hmm, perhaps I should proceed by assuming a certain k value, maybe the one at the inlet temperature, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the k value at the wall temperature. But in the given data, the k at T_w of 200°F is 40 lbm·s^(n-2)·ft^{-1}. So maybe we use k=40 for the calculation. But that would be at the wall, not the bulk. Hmm, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should proceed with k=40 because the wall is at 200°F, but perhaps the bulk temperature is somewhere in between. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the k at the average temperature, but I don't know the average yet because that's what I'm trying to find.

This is a bit of a conundrum. Perhaps I should proceed with k=40, considering that the heating is significant, and the fluid's properties are closer to the higher temperature. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the average of the two k values. Hmm, but without more information, it's hard to say. Maybe the problem expects me to use k as given at the average temperature, but I don't have that yet. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the k at the wall temperature since that's where the heat transfer is occurring.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the k value at the wall temperature for calculating the Reynolds number. So let me proceed with k=40.

So Re* = (rho * V^(2-n) * D^n) ) / k.

Plugging in the numbers:

rho = 65 lbm/ft³
V = 0.509 ft/s
n = 0.4
D = 1/12 ft ≈ 0.08333 ft
k = 40 lbm·s^(n'-1)·ft^{-1}? Wait, no, the unit for k is lbm·s^{n-2}·ft^{-1}.

Wait, but the units for Re* should be dimensionless. Let me check the units.

Re* has units of (lbm/ft³) * (ft/s)^(2-n) * (ft)^n / (lbm·s^(n-2)·ft^{-1} ).

Let me compute the exponents:

The numerator is lbm/ft³ * ft^{2(2-n)} * ft^{n} (since V^(2-n) is ft^(2-n) per second^(2-n), but perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Re* = [rho * V^{2-n} * D^n ] / k.

rho is lbm/ft³.

V is ft/s, so V^{2-n} is ft^{2-n} / s^{2-n}.

D is ft, so D^n is ft^n.

k is lbm·s^{n-2}·ft^{-1}.

So numerator: lbm/ft³ * [ft^{2-n} / s^{2-n}] * ft^n = lbm * ft^{(2-n) + n} / (ft³ * s^{2-n}) ) = lbm * ft^{2} / (ft³ s^{2-n}) ) = lbm / (ft s^{2-n}).

Denominator: lbm·s^{n-2}·ft^{-1}.

So Re* = [lbm/(ft s^{2-n})] / [lbm·s^{n-2}/ft] ] = [1/(ft s^{2-n})] * [ft/(s^{n-2}) )) ] = (1) / (s^{2-n} * s^{n-2}) ) = 1/s^{0} = dimensionless. That checks out.

So the units make sense. Now, let's compute Re*.

Compute each part:

V^(2-n) = 0.509^(2-0.4) = 0.509^(1.6). Let me compute that. 0.5^1.6 is around 0.5^(1+0.6)=0.5 * 0.5^0.6≈0.5 * 0.6598≈0.3299. But 0.509 is a bit more than 0.5, so maybe around 0.34.

D^n = (1/12)^(0.4). Let's compute that. 1/12 ≈ 0.08333. 0.08333^0.4. Hmm, 0.1^0.4 is about 0.632, but since 0.0833 is smaller than 0.1, it will be less. Maybe around 0.5? Let me compute it more accurately. Natural log: ln(1/12)= -2.4849. Multiply by 0.4: -0.99396. Exponentiate: e^{-0.99396} ≈ 0.370.

Wait, perhaps I should use a calculator approach, but I don't have one here. Alternatively, use approximations.

Alternatively, perhaps I can proceed with variables for now and plug in the numbers later.

So Re* = (65) * (0.509)^(1.6) * (1/12)^0.4 / 40.

Wait, let me compute each term numerically.

Compute V^(2-n):

V=0.509 ft/s, 2-n=1.6.

0.509^1.6 ≈ e^(1.6 * ln(0.509)).

ln(0.509) ≈ -0.677.

So 1.6*(-0.677)= -1.083.

e^{-1.083} ≈ 0.338.

So V^(1.6)=0.338.

D^n: (1/12)^0.4.

As before, that's approximately 0.0833^0.4 ≈ 0.52? Wait, earlier I thought around 0.37, but maybe better to compute.

Wait, 0.0833 is 1/12. Let me compute (1/12)^0.4.

Let me compute ln(1/12)= -2.4849.

Multiply by 0.4: -0.99396.

e^{-0.99396}= approx 0.370.

So D^n=0.370.

So numerator: 65 * 0.338 * 0.370.

65 * 0.338 = 22.0, then 22.0 * 0.370 ≈ 8.14.

Denominator is 40.

So Re* ≈ 8.14 /40 ≈ 0.2035.

Wait, that's a very low Reynolds number, which would imply laminar flow, which the problem states, so that's consistent.

Now, with Re* known, I can find the Nusselt number for a power-law fluid in laminar flow. I think the correlation is something like Nu = (h D / K) = some function of Re*, Pr, and n'.

Wait, for power-law fluids in laminar flow, the Nusselt number can be calculated using the formula:

Nu = [ (3n + 1) / (4n) )^(1/3) ] * (Re* )^(1/3) * Pr^(1/3) ) * [ (4n)/(3n +1) ) ]^(n/(2n+1)) )

Wait, I'm not sure about this. Alternatively, another source says that for power-law fluids in laminar flow, the average Nu is given by:

Nu = ( (3n + 1)/(4n) )^(1/3) * (Re* )^(1/3) * (Pr_a )^(1/3) )

Where Pr_a is the apparent Prandtl number, defined as Pr_a = (k c_p / K) ) * (4n/(3n +1 ))^(n) * (V D / (k/(rho))) )^{n-1} }

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe I should think differently.

Wait, the Prandtl number for power-law fluids is sometimes defined as Pr = (k c_p) / K * (4n/(3n+1)) )^{n} * (Re*)^{(1-n)} }

Wait, perhaps I should refer to the apparent Prandtl number as (k c_p / K) * (4n/(3n+1))^(n) * (Re*)^{n-1}.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach is needed. Let me try to find the Nusselt number expression.

Upon reviewing, I recall that for power-law fluids, the Nusselt number in laminar flow can be expressed as:

Nu = ( (3n + 1)/(4n) )^(1/3) * (Re* )^(1/3) * (Pr)^(1/3) )

Where Pr is the Prandtl number for power-law fluids, defined as Pr = (k c_p / K) * (4n/(3n + 1))^(n) * (Re*)^{n - 1}.

Wait, but this might not be correct. Alternatively, some sources suggest that the Nusselt number for power-law fluids is:

Nu = ( (3n + 1) / (4n) )^(1/3) * (Re* )^(1/3) * (Pr)^(1/3) )

where Pr is the usual Prandtl number, but for power-law fluids, it's (k c_p / K) times some function. Alternatively, perhaps the Prandtl number is simply (k c_p)/K, treating k as the consistency index.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to think differently. Let's compute the Prandtl number first, but for a power-law fluid.

The Prandtl number Pr is typically defined as (μ c_p)/K, where μ is the viscosity. But for a power-law fluid, μ is not constant. So instead, the apparent viscosity is used. The apparent viscosity μ_a is given by k (8 V / D)^{n-1}.

Wait, that might be a better approach. So the apparent viscosity μ_a = k (8 V / D)^{n-1}.

Then the Prandtl number Pr = μ_a c_p / K.

So let's compute μ_a first.

k is 40 lbm·s^{n'-2}·ft^{-1} (I think n' is 0.4). Wait, n' is given as 0.4. So the apparent viscosity μ_a = k * (8 V / D)^{n' - 1}.

Wait, n' is the power-law index. So n' = 0.4.

V is 0.509 ft/s, D is 1/12 ft.

So 8 V/D = 8 * 0.509 / (1/12) = 8 * 0.509 * 12 = 8 * 6.108 = 48.864 s^{-1}.

Now, (8 V/D)^{n' -1} = (48.864)^{0.4 -1} = (48.864)^{-0.6}.

Compute that: 48.864^0.6 is approximately, let's see, 48.864^0.6. Let me compute ln(48.864)=3.894. Multiply by 0.6: 2.336. e^2.336≈10.35.

So 48.864^0.6≈10.35. Therefore, 48.864^{-0.6}≈1/10.35≈0.0966.

So μ_a = 40 lbm·s^{n'-2}·ft^{-1} * 0.0966.

Wait, the units for μ_a should be lbm/(ft·s), which is the same as Pa·s. Let's check the units.

k is in lbm·s^{n'-2}·ft^{-1}.

(8 V/D) has units of s^{-1}.

So (8 V/D)^{n' -1} has units of s^{-(n'-1)}.

So μ_a has units of (lbm·s^{n'-2}·ft^{-1}) ) * s^{-(n'-1)} ) = lbm·s^{(n'-2 -n' +1)}·ft^{-1} = lbm·s^{(-1)}·ft^{-1}.

Wait, that gives lbm/(ft·s), which is correct because that's the unit of dynamic viscosity.

So μ_a = 40 * 0.096
