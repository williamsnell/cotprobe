Okay, so I have this question here asking which one of the options is NOT a mineral. Let me think through each option carefully.

First, I remember that for something to be a mineral, it must meet five specific criteria: it has to be a solid, naturally occurring, have a specific chemical composition, an ordered internal structure (crystal structure), and it forms naturally in the Earth's crust.

Let's go through each option one by one.

Option A is Calcite. I think calcite is a mineral. It's a carbonate mineral, calcium carbonate I believe. It's pretty common in rocks like limestone. So A is a mineral.

Option B is Quartz. Oh yeah, quartz is definitely a mineral. It's one of the most common ones, made of silicon and oxygen atoms. So B is a mineral.

Option C is Topaz. Topaz is a mineral too. It's a silicate mineral, I think aluminum silicate, and it's often used as a gemstone. So C is a mineral.

Option D is Diamond. Diamond is a mineral. It's pure carbon, just in a different crystal structure than graphite. So D is a mineral.

Option E is Gypsum. Gypsum is a mineral. It's a sulfate mineral, calcium sulfate dihydrate. Used in plaster and drywall, I think. So E is a mineral.

Option F is Graphite. Graphite is a mineral. It's another form of carbon, used in pencils and as a lubricant. So F is a mineral.

Option G is Feldspar. Feldspar is definitely a mineral. It's a group of rock-forming tectosilicate minerals, very common in igneous rocks. So G is a mineral.

Option H is Lithium. Wait, lithium is an element, right? It's a chemical element with the symbol Li. But is it considered a mineral? I don't think so. Because minerals are compounds, not elements unless they occur naturally as pure elements. Like gold or platinum can be minerals because they occur naturally as the element, but lithium as a standalone mineral? I'm not sure. Wait, I think lithium is more commonly found as part of compounds, like lithium aluminum silicates or something. So elemental lithium probably isn't a mineral because it doesn't form as a mineral naturally; it's extracted from compounds. So H might be the correct answer here.

Option I is Mica. Mica is a group of minerals. They are silicates, known for their shiny appearance. So I is a mineral.

So the only one that's not a mineral is H: Lithium. Because it's an element, not a naturally occurring compound with a crystal structure.

The question asks which option is NOT a mineral. A mineral must be a solid, naturally occurring, have a specific chemical composition, an ordered internal structure, and form naturally in the Earth's crust. 

- **A: Calcite** - A carbonate mineral (calcium carbonate), commonly found in rocks like limestone. It is a mineral.  
- **B: Quartz** - A silicate mineral (silicon dioxide), one of the most common minerals. It is a mineral.  
- **C: Topaz** - A silicate mineral (aluminum silicate), often used as a gemstone. It is a mineral.  
- **D: Diamond** - A mineral composed of pure carbon in a crystalline structure. It is a mineral.  
- **E: Gypsum** - A sulfate mineral (calcium sulfate dihydrate), used in plaster and drywall. It is a mineral.  
- **F: Graphite** - A mineral and another form of carbon, used in pencils and as a lubricant. It is a mineral.  
- **G: Feldspar** - A group of rock-forming tectosilicate minerals, very common in igneous rocks. It is a mineral.  
- **H: Lithium** - Lithium is a chemical element (Li), not a mineral. While it is found in minerals like lithium aluminum silicates, elemental lithium does not naturally form as a mineral.  
- **I: Mica** - A group of silicate minerals known for their shiny appearance. It is a mineral.  

The only option that is NOT a mineral is **H: Lithium**, as it is an element and does not meet the criteria for being a mineral.  

Answer: H
