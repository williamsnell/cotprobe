Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. Let me read it again carefully.

Army engineers have thrown a pontoon bridge that's 10 feet wide over a river that's 50 yards wide. When twelve identical trucks cross the river at the same time, the bridge sinks 1 foot. I need to find the weight of one truck. The density of water is given as 1.94 slugs per cubic foot.

Hmm, I think this is a buoyancy problem. So when the trucks are on the bridge, the bridge displaces water, and the weight of the displaced water equals the weight of the trucks. Since the bridge sinks by 1 foot, that tells me how much volume is submerged.

Wait, the bridge is 10 feet wide and 50 yards long. Wait, yards... I should convert that to feet because all other units are in feet. 1 yard is 3 feet, so 50 yards is 150 feet. So the bridge's dimensions are 10 ft (width) by 150 ft (length). But when it sinks by 1 ft, that's the depth of the submerged part, right?

So the volume displaced would be the area of the bridge that's submerged times the depth. Wait, actually, the submerged volume is length × width × depth submerged. So 150 ft long, 10 ft wide, 1 ft deep. That makes the volume 150 * 10 * 1 = 1500 cubic feet.

Wait, let me think again. When the bridge sinks 1 foot, that's the increase in submerged depth. So the volume of water displaced is the area of the bridge (length × width) multiplied by the change in depth. Oh right, because the bridge's cross-sectional area is length × width, and depth is the height of the submerged part.

So the displaced volume is 150 ft * 10 ft * 1 ft = 1500 cubic feet.

The density of water is 1.94 slugs per cubic foot. So the mass of the displaced water is density × volume. That's 1.94 slugs/ft³ * 1500 ft³ = let's calculate that. 1.94 * 1500 = 2910 slugs. Oh wait, wait, wait, no. Wait, 1.94 * 1500: 1500 is 1.5e3, 1.94 * 1.5 = 2.91, so 2.91e3, so 2910 slugs.

But wait, the total weight of the displaced water equals the total weight of the trucks on the bridge. Because the buoyant force (which is the weight of displaced water) supports the weight of the trucks and the bridge. But wait, does the problem say that the bridge alone might have some weight, or is the bridge's weight negligible? The problem says that when twelve trucks cross, the bridge sinks 1 foot. So I think we're assuming that the bridge's weight is not contributing to the sinking, or that the 1 foot sinking is due to the trucks. So the weight of the displaced water equals the combined weight of the twelve trucks.

Wait, actually, the problem states that when twelve trucks cross simultaneously, the bridge sinks 1 ft. So the displacement is due to the weight of the trucks. So the buoyant force from the displaced water equals the weight of the trucks.

So the weight of the displaced water is mass_water * g, where g is the acceleration due to gravity. Wait, but in the English system, weight is mass (in slugs) times g (32.2 ft/s²). So the weight of the displaced water is 2910 slugs * 32.2 ft/s². Let me compute that.

But wait, 2910 * 32.2. Let me do 2910 * 30 = 87,300, and 2910 * 2.2 = 6,402. So total is 87,300 + 6,402 = 93,702 lb. So 93,702 pounds is the total weight of the displaced water, which equals the total weight of the twelve trucks.

So each truck's weight is 93,702 / 12. Let me calculate that. 93,702 divided by 12.

Dividing 93,702 by 12:

12 × 7,000 = 84,000. 93,702 - 84,000 = 9,702.

12 × 800 = 9,600. So 7,800 so far, remainder 102.

12 × 8.5 = 102. So 7,800 + 8.5 = 7,808.5 lb. So approximately 7,808.5 pounds per truck.

Looking at the options, let's see. The options are A:9000, B:7760, C:8850, D:7000, E:9500, F:8600, G:8200, H:6500, I:8100, J:7300.

Wait, my calculation got approximately 7,808.5 lb per truck. So looking for something close to that. The closest option is G:8200. But let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the volume calculation. Let me go back.

The bridge is 10 ft wide, 50 yards long. 50 yards is 150 feet. When the bridge sinks 1 foot, the submerged part is 150 ft (length) * 10 ft (width) * 1 ft (depth) = 1500 cubic feet. That seems correct.

Density of water is 1.94 slugs per cubic foot. So mass displaced is 1.94 * 1500 = 2910 slugs. That's correct.

Weight displaced is mass * g = 2910 * 32.2 ft/s². 2910 *32=?

Wait, 2910 * 32 = let me compute that. 2910 *30=87,300, 2910*2=5,820. So 87,300 +5,820=93,120. Then 0.2 * 2910 = 582. So total is 93,120 + 582 = 93,702 lb. So that part is correct.

Divide by 12: 93,702 /12 = 7,808.5 lb per truck.

Looking at the options, option G is 8200, which is very close. But let me see if I made a mistake in unit conversion. Wait, is the density correct? The density of water is given as 1.94 slugs per cubic foot, which is correct because 1 slug is about 32.174 lb·s²/ft.

Wait, but the standard density of water is 62.4 lb/ft³, which is equivalent to 1 slug per cubic foot. Wait, no, 62.4 lb/ft³ equals 1 slug/ft³, because weight (lb) = mass (slugs) * g (32.2 ft/s²). So 62.4 lb/ft³ = (mass in slugs) * 32.2 ft/s²/ft³. So mass (slugs) = 62.4 /32.2 ≈ 1.94 slugs/ft³. So that's correct.

So the calculation seems accurate. So each truck is about 7,808 lb. The closest option is G:8200, but wait, let me check if perhaps I made a mistake in the number of trucks.

Wait, the problem says twelve identical trucks. So 93,702 /12 = 7,808.5 lb each. So that's 7,808.5, which is approximately 7,800 lb. Looking at the options, option G is 8,200, which is a bit higher. Is there a closer option?

Looking again: the options are A:9000, B:7760, C:8850, D:7000, E:9500, F:8600, G:8200, H:6500, I:8100, J:7300.

Hmm, 7,808 is closest to 7,800, but the options don't have 7,800. The options have B:7760, I:8100, G:8200, etc. Wait, 7,808 is 7.8k, which is 7808. So the closest is I:8100 (8.1k) or B:7760.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the division. Let me recheck: 93,702 divided by 12.

Alternative approach: 12 * 7,800 = 93,600. 93,702 -93,600 =102 left. 102/12 =8.5. So 7,800 +8.5=7,808.5 lb. So it's 7,808.5 lb.

Looking again, the options don't have 7,808.5. The closest is I:8100, which is 8,100 lb.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the volume. Let me double-check.

The bridge is 10 ft wide, 50 yards long. So 50 yards = 150 ft. So length is 150 ft. When it sinks 1 ft, the submerged depth is 1 ft. So the volume displaced is 150 *10 *1 =1500 ft³. That's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem says the entire bridge's area is 10 ft width and 50 yd length, so 10 * 150 = 1500 ft², and multiplied by 1 ft depth gives 1500 ft³.

So I think that's correct. So the displaced water's weight is 93,702 lb, divided by 12 gives 7,808.5 lb per truck.

Since the options don't have exactly this, perhaps I should check if the problem accounts for the weight of the bridge itself. Because the bridge might have some weight that's also being supported by buoyancy even when the trucks aren't on it. But the problem states that when the twelve trucks cross, the bridge sinks 1 ft. So perhaps the 1 ft sinking is the additional displacement due to the trucks. So the total buoyant force without trucks would be less, and with the trucks, it's more by 1 ft.

Wait, no, the problem says that the bridge is thrown over the river, so I think we can assume that the bridge's own weight is supported by its own buoyancy, and the additional load from the trucks causes an additional 1 ft of submersion. So the displaced volume is due to the trucks only.

But perhaps that's an incorrect assumption. Let me think again.

If the bridge itself has a certain buoyancy, and when the trucks are added, it displaces more water, causing it to sink more. So the 1 ft sinking is the additional displacement due to the trucks.

But in that case, the volume displaced by the bridge alone would be when it's not loaded. But without knowing the bridge's weight, perhaps the assumption is that the 1 ft sinking is entirely due to the trucks.

Wait, the problem says: When twelve identical trucks cross the river simultaneously the bridge sinks 1 ft. So perhaps the bridge's own weight is supported without submerging that 1 ft, and the 1 ft is the additional submergence due to the trucks.

So the displaced water volume is 1500 ft³, which is the additional volume due to the trucks. So that would mean the weight of the 12 trucks is equal to the weight of 1500 ft³ of water.

So that would go back to the same calculation as before, leading to 7,808 lb per truck.

But the options don't have that exact number. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the volume.

Wait, wait, perhaps the bridge's width is 10 ft, so when it's submerged 1 ft, the cross-sectional area is 10 ft (width) times 1 ft (depth), and the length is 150 ft. So the volume is 150 *10 *1 =1500 ft³. That's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the bridge's dimensions are 10 feet in width and 50 yards in length, but when it's a pontoon bridge, perhaps the pontoons are 10 feet in width and 50 yards in length, but the bridge's structure adds more to the width. No, the problem states the bridge is 10 ft in width and 50 yd (150 ft) in length.

Hmm. Maybe the mistake is in the calculation of the weight of the displaced water. Let me compute 1.94 slugs/ft³ * 1500 ft³ = 2910 slugs. Then multiply by 32.2 ft/s² to get weight in pounds.

2910 *32.2 = let's compute this accurately.

2910 * 32 = 93,120 lb.

2910 *0.2 = 582 lb.

So total is 93,120 +582 = 93,702 lb.

Yes, that's correct.

So 93,702 lb divided by 12 trucks is 7,808.5 lb per truck.

Looking at the options, the closest is I:8100 lb (8,100), which is 291.5 lb higher than 7,808.5. The next possible is B:7760, which is 48.5 lb less. So 7,808.5 is not an option.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the question is about the total weight including the bridge. Let me see.

Wait, the problem doesn't mention the bridge's own weight, so I think the assumption is correct that the 1 ft sinking is due to the trucks. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely. So I might have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion. Let me think about this again.

Wait, the density is given as 1.94 slugs per cubic foot. So mass is 1.94 * volume. Then weight is mass * g.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses a different value for g. Typically, in some problems, g is taken as 32 ft/s² for simplification.

If I use g=32, then 2910 slugs *32 lb/slug = 93,120 lb. Then 93,120 /12=7,760 lb per truck.

Ah, wait, that's exactly option B: 7,760 lb.

So perhaps the problem uses g=32 instead of 32.2. That would make sense.

So let me recompute with g=32:

2910 *32=?

2910 *30=87,300.

2910 *2=5,820.

Total: 93,120 lb.

Divide by 12: 93,120/12=7,760 lb.

So that's option B:7,760 lb.

But earlier I used 32.2, which gave me 7,808 lb, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended approach was to use g=32 ft/s².

So the correct answer would be option B:7,760 lb.

To solve the problem, we analyze it as a buoyancy issue where the weight of the displaced water equals the combined weight of the twelve trucks. The bridge dimensions are given as 10 ft in width and 50 yds in length, which converts to 150 ft. When the bridge sinks 1 ft under the weight of the trucks, the displaced volume of water is:

\[
\text{Volume displaced} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth} = 150 \, \text{ft} \times 10 \, \text{ft} \times 1 \, \text{ft} = 1500 \, \text{ft}^3.
\]

The density of water is given as \(1.94 \, \text{slugs/ft}^3\). The mass of the displaced water is:

\[
\text{Mass displaced} = \text{density} \times \text{volume} = 1.94 \, \text{slugs/ft}^3 \times 1500 \, \text{ft}^3 = 2910 \, \text{slugs}.
\]

The weight of the displaced water is calculated as:

\[
\text{Weight displaced} = \text{mass} \times g = 2910 \, \text{slugs} \times 32 \, \text{ft/s}^2 = 93,120 \, \text{lb}.
\]

This weight equals the combined weight of the twelve trucks. Therefore, the weight of one truck is:

\[
\text{Weight of one truck} = \frac{\text{Total weight displaced}}{\text{Number of trucks}} = \frac{93,120 \, \text{lb}}{12} = 7760 \, \text{lb}.
\]

Thus, the weight of one truck is approximately \(7760 \, \text{lb}\), which corresponds to option **B**.
