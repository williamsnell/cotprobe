Okay, so I have this question about Augustine and his view on Academic skepticism. I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that Academic skepticism was a school of thought in ancient Greece, particularly associated with the Academy after Plato. They were known for their skeptical views, especially about the possibility of certain knowledge. I think they argued that knowledge is impossible, or at least that we can't be certain about anything.

Augustine, on the other hand, was a Christian philosopher and theologian. He was influenced by various philosophical traditions, including Platonism, but he also had strong views against skepticism. I recall that he wrote against the Academic skeptics, arguing that their skepticism was self-defeating or flawed in some way.

So the question is asking what Augustine claims about Academic skepticism. The options are about whether it's true or false and whether it can be proven or refuted.

Let me think about each part. Is Academic skepticism true according to Augustine? Probably not. Since Augustine opposed skepticism, he likely thought it was false. So the options where it's false would be C, D, G, I.

Next, can it be refuted? If Augustine argues against it, he must believe it can be refuted. So the options that say it's false and can be refuted would be C, or maybe G. Wait, looking back, option C says it's false and can be refuted. Option G says it's false but can be proven, which doesn't make sense because if it's false, proving it would mean showing it's true, which isn't the case.

So option C looks promising. But wait, another angle: Augustine might have believed that skepticism is not only false but also that it can be shown to be false through argument. So he would refute it, meaning he can show it's false.

Wait, but another point: sometimes in philosophy, people argue that a position is self-refuting. For example, the statement "I know nothing" can be seen as self-defeating because if you know that, then you do know something. So Augustine might have used such arguments against the Academics.

So, putting it together: Augustine would say Academic skepticism is false and that it can be refuted through argument. So the correct option would be C: is false and can be refuted.

Wait, but looking at the options again, let me check:

Option C: is false and can be refuted.

Yes, that fits.

Augustine opposed Academic skepticism, viewing it as a flawed philosophy. He likely considered it false and believed it could be refuted through argumentation, possibly by showing it to be self-defeating.

Answer: C
