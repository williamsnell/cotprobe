Question:

A city imposes a tax on nonresident's city derived income above $1,700 at a 3% rate, except that if the nonresident's state of residence would impose a lesser tax had the income been earned in that state, the city tax would be reduced to that amount. This income tax exempts taxable income earned by city residents outside of the state. Moreover, residents of the city were not taxed on their in-city earned income. A commuter who works in the city but is a resident of a neighboring state, challenges the constitutionality of this statute. Which of the following provisions would furnish the most applicable basis for this constitutional challenge?

Options:

A: The Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment.
B: The privileges and immunities clause of ArticleIV.
C: The Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause.
D: The First Amendment's freedom of speech clause.
E: The Tenth Amendment's reservation of powers to the states.
F: The Second Amendment's right to bear arms.
G: The Fifth Amendment's protection against self-incrimination.
H: The commerce clause.
I: The Sixth Amendment's right to a speedy trial.

Okay, so I've got this question about constitutional law, specifically about a city imposing a tax and someone challenging it. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to break it down step by step. Let me see what the question says.

So the city is taxing nonresidents' income derived from the city, but only the amount above $1,700 at a 3% rate. There's an exception: if the nonresident's home state would impose a lesser tax on that income, the city tax is reduced to that amount. Also, the tax exempts taxable income that city residents earn outside the state. And importantly, city residents aren't taxed on their in-city income.

A commuter who works in the city but lives in a neighboring state is challenging this statute's constitutionality. The question is asking which constitutional provision would be the basis for this challenge.

The options are A through J, each citing a different constitutional clause or amendment. I need to figure out which one applies here.

Hmm, so the key here is that the tax is imposed on nonresidents but not on residents. That sounds like a potential discrimination issue. I remember that the Constitution has clauses that prevent states (and by extension, cities) from discriminating against nonresidents in certain ways.

One important clause is the Privileges and Immunities Clause in Article IV. It says that states can't discriminate against citizens of other states in terms of fundamental rights, like employment or earning a livelihood. So if the city is taxing nonresidents but not residents on the same type of income, that could be a problem under this clause.

Wait, but I also recall something about the Commerce Clause. The Commerce Clause gives Congress power over interstate commerce, and sometimes states can't impose undue burdens on it. But does that apply here? The tax is on income earned within the city, but the person is a nonresident. I'm not sure if that's a commerce issue or a privileges and immunities issue.

Another possibility is the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. That could relate to whether the tax is fairly applied. But I think the more specific issue here is discrimination against nonresidents, which points more towards the Privileges and Immunities Clause.

Let me think about relevant cases. There's the case of Toomer v. Witsell, where the Supreme Court held that South Carolina couldn't impose a higher license fee on nonresident shrimpers than on residents. The reasoning was that it violated the Privileges and Immunities Clause because it discriminated against nonresidents in their ability to earn a living.

Similarly, in this question, the city is taxing nonresidents on their city-derived income while exempting residents. That seems like a similar situation. So the commuter would likely challenge this under the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV.

Option B is that clause, so that's probably the correct answer.

Wait, but what about the Commerce Clause? Could that also apply? The Commerce Clause might be involved if the tax burdens interstate commerce, but in this case, it's more about the tax affecting nonresidents' employment income. The Privileges and Immunities Clause seems more directly applicable because it's about treating nonresidents differently in terms of their ability to work and earn income.

So I think the answer is B, the privileges and immunities clause of Article IV.

The question concerns a city imposing a tax on nonresidents' city-derived income while exempting residents, prompting a constitutional challenge by a commuter. The key issue is whether this tax discriminates against nonresidents in a way that violates constitutional protections.

The Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV is the most applicable basis for this challenge. It prohibits states (and cities) from discriminating against nonresidents regarding fundamental rights, such as employment or earning a livelihood. The tax in question taxes nonresidents on their city-derived income while exempting residents, creating a discriminatory effect. This aligns with cases like *Toomer v. Witsell*, where the Supreme Court ruled that such discrimination violates the Privileges and Immunities Clause.

While the Commerce Clause could theoretically apply if the tax burdened interstate commerce, the specific issue here is discrimination against nonresidents, making the Privileges and Immunities Clause the more relevant provision.

Answer: B
