Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how culture is a source of social influence. Hmm, I remember that culture refers to the shared beliefs, values, customs, behaviors, and artifacts that characterize a group or society. So, social influence would be how these cultural elements shape the way people think, feel, and behave.

Looking at the options, let me go through each one. 

Option A says culture dictates individual preferences. Well, that might be part of it, but I'm not sure if it's the most comprehensive answer. Culture does influence preferences, but maybe there's more to it.

Option B suggests culture determines genetic makeup. That doesn't sound right. Genetics is separate from culture; culture is learned, not inherited biologically.

Option C links culture to physical health and wellbeing. I know that culture can influence health behaviors, but is that the primary way it exerts social influence? Maybe not the main point here.

Option D says culture shapes language and thus controls communication. Language is a big part of culture, and it does influence how we communicate. But does it control all forms? That seems a bit too absolute.

Option E connects culture to economic status. While culture might affect economic behaviors or opportunities, it's not the direct source of economic status, which is influenced by many factors.

Option F claims culture solely determines career paths. That seems too strong; individual choices, education, and other factors also play roles.

Option G states that culture provides ready-made answers for life problems, dictates routines, and gives ways to cope. This sounds familiar. Culture offers norms, values, and practices that people follow, which guides their behavior and interactions. This seems like a broad and accurate description of social influence.

Option H says culture alters the physical environment. While culture can influence how people interact with their environment, like building styles, it's not the direct alteration of the environment itself. Plus, the physical environment is more about nature and technology.

Option I mentions political structure. Culture does influence politics, but that's a specific aspect and not the primary way culture influences society as a whole.

Option J says culture is inherited biologically. No, culture is transmitted socially, not through genetics.

So, considering all options, G seems to capture the essence of how culture serves as a source of social influence by providing solutions, structuring interactions, and offering coping mechanisms.
