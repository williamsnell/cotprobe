Okay, so I've got this logic problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to predicate logic, but I'll try to break it down step by step. The question is about translating an English sentence into predicate logic, and there are multiple-choice options to choose from.

The sentence is: "Some firefighters rescue victims from danger." The predicates given are:
- Dx: x is danger
- Fx: x is a firefighter
- Vx: x is a victim
- Rxyz: x rescues y from z

So, first, I need to understand what the sentence is saying. "Some firefighters" means that there exists at least one firefighter. Then, each of these firefighters does something: they rescue victims from danger. So the structure is that there's a firefighter (let's say x) who rescues a victim (y) from a danger (z).

Putting this into symbols, I think it would be something like:
There exists an x such that x is a firefighter, and there exists a y such that y is a victim, and there exists a z such that z is danger, and x rescues y from z.

Wait, but the way the sentence is phrased, it's "some firefighters rescue victims from danger." So it's not that each firefighter rescues every victim, but rather that for each firefighter, there's at least one victim they rescue, and the danger they rescue them from.

Wait, no, that might not be exactly right. Because the sentence doesn't specify how many victims each firefighter rescues. It just says some firefighters do the action of rescuing victims from danger. So perhaps it's sufficient to say that there's at least one firefighter, and for that firefighter, there's at least one victim and at least one danger, such that the firefighter rescues the victim from that danger.

So the structure would be: ∃x (Fx ∧ ∃y (Vy ∧ ∃z (Dz ∧ Rxyz)) )

Now, looking at the options, I need to find which one matches this structure.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: ∀x {Fx ⊃ (∃y)[Vy . (∃z)(Dz • Rxyz)]}
This is a universal statement. It says for all x, if x is a firefighter, then there exists a y (victim) and z (danger) such that x rescues y from z. That would mean every firefighter rescues some victim from some danger, which is stronger than the original statement. The original says "some firefighters" do this, not all. So A is not correct.

Option B: (∃x){Fx • (∀y)[Dy ⊃ (∃z)(Vz • Rxyz)]}
This says there exists a firefighter x, and for all y, if y is danger, then there exists a z (victim) such that x rescues z from y. Wait, that doesn't make sense because y is danger, but then z is the victim. Also, the original statement doesn't relate all dangers to being rescued, just that some danger is involved. So B might not be the right structure.

Option C: ∀x {Fx ⊃ (∃y)[Dy . (∃z)(Vz • Rxyz)]}
Again, a universal quantifier. For every firefighter, there exists a danger y, and a victim z, such that x rescues z from y. But the original statement doesn't require every firefighter to do this, just some. So C is incorrect.

Option D: (∃x){Fx • (∀y)[Vy ⊃ (∀z)(Dz • Rxyz)]}
This says there exists a firefighter x, and for all victims y, if y is a victim, then for all dangers z, x rescues y from z. That's way too strong. It would mean that one firefighter rescues every victim from every danger, which isn't what the original sentence states. So D is incorrect.

Option E: (∃x){Fx • (∀y)[Vy ⊃ (∃z)(Dz • Rxyz)]}
Here, there's a firefighter x, and for every victim y, if y is a victim, then there exists a danger z such that x rescues y from z. This implies that the firefighter rescues every victim from some danger. But the original statement doesn't say that every victim is rescued, just that some firefighters rescue some victims. So E might be too broad.

Option F: ∀x {Fx ⊃ (∀y)[Vy ⊃ (∃z)(Dz • Rxyz)]}
This is a universal statement again. For every firefighter x, and every victim y, if y is a victim, then there's a danger z such that x rescues y from z. Again, this suggests that every firefighter rescues every victim from some danger, which is more than the original statement. So F is incorrect.

Option G: (∃x){Fx • (∃y)[Dy • (∃z)(Vz • Rzxy)]}
This structure has a firefighter x, a danger y, and a victim z, such that z rescues x from y. Wait, the Rxyz is defined as x rescues y from z. So in this case, Rzxy would mean z rescues x from y, which is the opposite. The firefighter should be the one rescuing, so z would be the victim, which doesn't make sense. So G is incorrect because the order in R is wrong.

Option H: (∃x){Fx • (∃y)[Vy • (∃z)(Dz • Rxyz)]}
This says there's a firefighter x, and there's a victim y, and a danger z, such that x rescues y from z. This seems to match our initial breakdown. Let me double-check. Yes, it's saying there exists an x (firefighter), y (victim), z (danger), and x rescues y from z. That fits the original statement correctly.

Option I: (∃x){Fx • (∃y)[Dy • (∃z)(Vz • Rxyz)]}
Here, there's a firefighter x, a danger y, and a victim z, such that x rescues z from y. Wait, Dy here is the danger. So Rxyz would mean x rescues y (danger) from z? Wait, no, wait. Rxyz is x rescues y from z. So if y is danger, then it would be x rescues a danger from z, which doesn't make sense because you rescue victims, not dangers. So I think this option is incorrect because the variables are misplaced.

Option J: (∃x){Fx • (∃y)(∃z)[(Vy • Dz) • Rxzy]}
This has a firefighter x, and then a victim y and a danger z, but the R is Rxzy, which would mean x rescues z from y. But z is danger, and y is victim. So it's x rescues danger z from victim y, which doesn't make sense. The rescue should be the firefighter rescuing the victim from danger.

So, after going through each option, the correct one seems to be H. It correctly structures the existence of a firefighter, a victim, and a danger, with the firefighter rescuing the victim from the danger.

The sentence "Some firefighters rescue victims from danger" can be translated into predicate logic as follows:

- **Fx**: x is a firefighter  
- **Vy**: y is a victim  
- **Dz**: z is danger  
- **Rxyz**: x rescues y from z  

The correct translation is:  
There exists a firefighter (x), a victim (y), and a danger (z) such that x rescues y from z. In symbols:  
**∃x (Fx ∧ ∃y (Vy ∧ ∃z (Dz ∧ Rxyz)))**

Now, analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. It uses a universal quantifier (∀x), implying every firefighter rescues some victim from some danger, which is stronger than the original statement.
- **B**: Incorrect. It suggests that for all dangers, a firefighter rescues victims, which misrepresents the original meaning.
- **C**: Incorrect. It uses a universal quantifier (∀x), implying every firefighter rescues some victim from some danger, which is not stated in the original sentence.
- **D**: Incorrect. It implies one firefighter rescues every victim from every danger, which is overly broad.
- **E**: Incorrect. It suggests a firefighter rescues every victim from some danger, which is stronger than the original statement.
- **F**: Incorrect. It uses universal quantifiers (∀x, ∀y), implying every firefighter rescues every victim from some danger, which is not stated.
- **G**: Incorrect. It incorrectly uses Rzxy, reversing the roles of rescuer and victim.
- **H**: Correct. It matches the structure ∃x (Fx ∧ ∃y (Vy ∧ ∃z (Dz ∧ Rxyz))), accurately representing the original sentence.
- **I**: Incorrect. It misplaces the danger (y) and victim (z) in the rescue relation.
- **J**: Incorrect. It uses Rxzy, reversing the roles of victim and danger.

The correct answer is **H**.
