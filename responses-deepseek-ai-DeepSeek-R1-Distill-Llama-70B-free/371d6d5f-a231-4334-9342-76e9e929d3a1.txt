Question:

During assigned seat-work time, Mary, a firstgrade student, sometimes leaves her seat and attempts to play with a block collection. When she leaves her seat, she fails to complete her seat work. Which of the following behavioral intervention strategies will most effectively increase the long-term likelihood that Mary will complete her seat work?

Options:

A: Instituting a class-wide reward system for staying in seats during work time
B: Giving Mary additional seat work as a consequence for leaving her seat
C: Having a one-on-one talk with Mary about the importance of discipline in class
D: Allowing Mary to read from a teacherselected book for a specific period of time before beginning her seat work
E: Removing the blocks from the classroom during the assigned seat-work time
F: Assigning a classmate to monitor Mary's behavior during seat-work time
G: Allowing Mary to play with the blocks afterward if she remains in her seat throughout the assigned seat-work time
H: Explaining to Mary the value of completing seat work in terms of the objectives of the lesson
I: Allowing Mary to play with the blocks while doing her seat work
J: Ignoring Mary when she leaves her seat to play with the blocks

Okay, so I've got this question about Mary, a first-grade student who keeps leaving her seat during seat-work time to play with blocks. She ends up not finishing her work because of this. The question is asking which behavioral intervention strategy would most effectively increase the long-term likelihood that Mary will complete her seat work.

Hmm, let me think through this. I remember that behavioral interventions often focus on reinforcing desired behaviors and reducing undesired ones. So, the key here is to find a strategy that encourages Mary to stay in her seat and do her work.

Looking at the options:

Option A: A class-wide reward system for staying in seats. That could work because everyone gets a reward when they behave, but it's more of a group approach. I'm not sure how effective it is for an individual like Mary who's specifically having trouble.

Option B: Giving more seat work as a consequence. Wait, that doesn't sound right. If she's already not completing her work, giving more might just make it worse and could be punitive without teaching the right behavior.

Option C: One-on-one talk about discipline. Talking to her might make her understand why she should behave, but if it's just a talk without any follow-up or incentives, it might not have a long-term effect.

Option D: Letting her read a selected book before starting seat work. That could be a way to motivate her, but I'm not sure if reading time would make her want to do her work afterward. It might just delay the problem.

Option E: Removing the blocks during seat work. That makes sense because if the blocks aren't there, she can't be tempted to play with them. But is that the best long-term solution? It might work temporarily, but it doesn't teach her to stay on task when distractions are present.

Option F: Assigning a classmate to monitor her. Having a peer watch her could help, but it might also create dependence on that classmate and not address the root cause of her behavior.

Option G: Allowing her to play with blocks afterward if she stays in her seat. This seems like a positive reinforcement strategy. If she completes her work, she gets the reward she wants. That could motivate her to stay on task because she associates completing her work with getting to play with the blocks.

Option H: Explaining the value of seat work. That's similar to option C. It's about understanding, which is good, but without a tangible incentive, it might not be enough to change her behavior.

Option I: Letting her play with blocks while doing seat work. That might be distracting because she can't focus on both at the same time. Plus, it doesn't teach her to stay on task without the blocks.

Option J: Ignoring her when she leaves. Ignoring might not address the issue. If she's seeking attention or just likes playing, ignoring could let the behavior continue without any consequence or alternative.

So, thinking about behavioral psychology, positive reinforcement is a strong strategy. Rewarding desired behavior increases the likelihood it will happen again. Option G offers a reward (playing with blocks) for the desired action (staying in seat and completing work). That seems effective because it directly ties the reward to the behavior we want.

I'm a bit confused between options A and G. Option A is a class-wide system, which might have some effect, but it's not as targeted as G, which directly addresses Mary's specific motivation (playing with blocks). So G is more likely to have a long-term impact on her individually.

The most effective strategy to increase the long-term likelihood that Mary will complete her seat work is to use positive reinforcement. By allowing her to play with the blocks afterward if she remains in her seat and completes her work, Mary is motivated to stay on task because the reward is directly tied to the desired behavior. This approach addresses her specific interest in playing with blocks and encourages her to associate completing her work with a positive outcome.

Answer: G
