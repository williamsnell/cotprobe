Okay, so I've got this problem here about Mr. Johnson discounting a draft. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on finance calculations, but let's see if I can figure this out step by step. 

The problem says that Mr. Johnson discounted a non-interest bearing draft for $850 due on July 12. He did this on July 1, and the discount rate is 5%. They want to know his proceeds, and we have to assume a 365-day year. The options are A through J, with various amounts.

Wait, so a draft is like a bill of exchange, right? And if it's non-interest bearing, that means it's a simple discount, not adding any interest. So the face value is $850, but he's getting it discounted before it's due.

So the key here is to calculate the discount he has to pay and subtract that from the face value to get his proceeds. The formula for discount is generally (face value × discount rate × time). But wait, time is in years, right?

The draft is due on July 12 and he's discounting it on July 1. So the time period is from July 1 to July 12. Let's calculate the number of days. July 1 to July 12 is 12 - 1 = 11 days. Oh wait, wait! Because when you count the days from the 1st to the 12th, you include both days? Or is it the number of days between them? Hmm, sometimes in these calculations, it's the number of days the money is being used. So from July 1 to July 12, that's 11 days. Because July 1 is day 0, then 2nd is day 1, up to July 12 which is day 11. So 11 days.

Wait, but another way to think: July 1 is when the discount happens, and the draft is due July 12. So the time is 11 days, right? Because from July 1 to July 12 is 11 days later. So 11 days out of 365.

So the discount amount is (850) * (5%) * (11/365). Let me compute that.

First, 5% is 0.05. So 850 * 0.05 = 42.5. Then, multiply that by (11/365). So 42.5 * (11/365). Let's compute that.

11 divided by 365 is approximately 0.03013699. So 42.5 * 0.03013699 ≈ 1.282. So the discount is about $1.282.

Wait, let me do that more accurately. Let me calculate 11/365 exactly. 11 ÷ 365. Let's see, 365 × 0.03 is 10.95. 0.03 is 10.95, and 11 is 0.05 more than 10.95. So 0.03 + (0.05/365) ≈ 0.03 + 0.00013699 ≈ 0.03013699. So the 11/365 is approx 0.030137.

So 42.5 multiplied by 0.030137. Let me do 42.5 * 0.03 = 1.275. Then 42.5 * 0.000137. Let's calculate that: 42.5 * 0.0001 is 0.00425, and 42.5 * 0.000037 is 0.0015725. So total is approx 0.00425 + 0.0015725 ≈ 0.0058225. So total discount is 1.275 + 0.0058225 ≈ 1.2808225. So about $1.28.

So the proceeds would be the face value minus the discount. So 850 - 1.2808 = 848.7192. So approximately $848.72. Let me look at the options. Option C is $848.72. So that's probably the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's recalculate the discount.

Discount = 850 * 0.05 * (11/365)

Let me compute 850 * 0.05 first. That's 42.5. Then 42.5 * (11/365) = ?

Calculate 11/365 first. 365 ÷ 11 is about 33.1818, so 11/365 is 1/33.1818 ≈ 0.030136. So 42.5 * 0.030136 ≈ let's calculate:

42.5 * 0.03 = 1.275
42.5 * 0.000136 = ?

0.0001 *42.5=0.00425
0.000036 *42.5=0.00153
So 0.00425 + 0.00153 = 0.00578
So total discount is 1.275 + 0.00578 = 1.28078. So $1.28078.

Subtracting that from 850 gives 850 - 1.28078 = 848.71922, which is $848.72. So option C.

Wait, but let me think again: another way to compute the discount. Maybe using the formula for present value.

The present value (PV) is face value/(1 + (rate × time)). But wait, no, that's for interest-bearing notes. Since this is a discount, the formula is PV = face value × (1 - rate × time). Wait, no, I think for simple discount, the formula is:

Proceeds = face value - (face value × rate × time). So yes, same as what I did earlier.

Another approach: compute the discount as (850 × 5% × 11/365) = 850 × 0.05 × (11/365) = 42.5 × (11/365). 

Let me compute 42.5 × (11/365). 42.5 × 11 = 467.5. Then 467.5 / 365 = let's compute that. 365 × 1.28 is 365 ×1=365, 365×0.28=102.2 → 365+102.2=467.2. So 467.5 is just a little over 1.28 (since 467.2 is 1.28). So 467.5 /365 = approx 1.28068. So the discount is $1.28068.

So proceeds are 850 - 1.28068 = 848.71932. So about 848.72, which is option C.

Looking at the options, option C is $848.72. So I think that's the correct answer.

To determine Mr. Johnson's proceeds from discounting the non-interest bearing draft, we calculate the discount amount and subtract it from the face value of the draft. The face value is $850, the discount rate is 5%, and the time period is 11 days (from July 1 to July 12). Using a 365-day year, the discount is calculated as:

\[
\text{Discount} = 850 \times 0.05 \times \frac{11}{365}
\]

First, compute \( 850 \times 0.05 = 42.5 \). Then, calculate \( \frac{11}{365} \approx 0.030136 \). Multiplying these together:

\[
42.5 \times 0.030136 \approx 1.28078
\]

Thus, the discount is approximately $1.28078. The proceeds are:

\[
\text{Proceeds} = 850 - 1.28078 = 848.71922 \approx 848.72
\]

Comparing this result to the options provided, the closest match is **$848.72**, which corresponds to option C.

**Answer: C**
