Question:

A large island is devastated by a volcanic eruption. Most of the horses die except for the heaviest males and heaviest females of the group. They survive, reproduce, and perpetuate the population. Since weight is highly heritable and the distribution of weights approximates a binomial distribution, the offspring of the next generation would be expected to have

Options:

A: a higher mean weight compared with members of the original population
B: the same mean weight as members of the original population
C: a lower mean weight compared with their parents
D: the same mean weight as their parents
E: a lower mean weight compared with members of the original population
F: a greater range of weights compared to the original population
G: a weight distribution skewed towards lighter weights

Okay, so I've got this biology question here about natural selection and genetics. Let me try to break it down. The scenario is that a large island is hit by a volcanic eruption, which causes most of the horses to die. But the ones that survive are the heaviest males and heaviest females. They then reproduce and continue the population.

The question is about what happens to the mean weight of the next generation. The options are A through G, each suggesting different possibilities about the mean weight compared to the original population or their parents.

First, I remember that in natural selection, the individuals that survive are the ones with traits that are favorable in their environment. Here, the volcanic eruption probably made resources scarce, so heavier horses, maybe with more fat reserves or strength, were better suited to survive.

Weight is mentioned to be highly heritable, which means that the genes responsible for weight are passed down effectively. So the surviving heavy males and females would pass on their genes for heavier weight to their offspring.

The original population's weight distribution is approximately binomial. Binomial distribution usually has two distinct outcomes, but in a biological context, perhaps it's more about a distribution with a certain mean and variance. But I think the key point is that the parents are from the heavier end of this distribution.

So in the next generation, the offspring would inherit the heavier traits. That suggests that the average weight (mean) of the next generation would be higher than that of the original population. Because the parents were selected from the higher end, their offspring would have a higher mean.

Wait, but one of the options says higher mean compared to the original, which is option A. Another option, C, says lower mean compared to parents. So I need to figure out if the next generation's mean is higher than the original but perhaps not higher than their parents.

Wait, the parents are the heaviest, so their offspring would likely have a higher average than the original population. Because in the original population, the average was lower. The surviving parents are above average, so their offspring would bring up the average.

Hmm, but wait—natural selection can sometimes lead to the population mean shifting. If only the heavier individuals breed, their genes will make the next generation heavier on average. So the mean should increase.

So the original population's mean was, say, μ. The parents have a mean higher than μ. Their offspring would have a mean somewhere between μ and the parents' mean, but probably higher than μ. So the next generation's mean would be higher than the original population's mean, which is option A.

Wait, but could it be that the next generation's mean is the same as their parents? Because if the genes are passed on, perhaps their mean would match the parents' mean. But if the original population had a mean lower than the parents', then the next generation's mean would be higher than the original. But whether it's higher than the parents' mean? That depends on whether the selection is strong and if the trait is heritable.

Wait, in this scenario, it's stated that weight is highly heritable, so the offspring should resemble the parents. So if the parents are heavier than the original population, the offspring's mean would be higher than the original but perhaps the same as the parents' mean. Or is it possible that the offspring's mean would be somewhere in between, not as high as the parents?

Wait, no. If the parents are the heaviest, and they breed, their offspring would have genes that make them heavier than the original average. Let me think about it numerically. Suppose the original population has a mean weight of 400 kg, with a range from 300 to 500. The eruption kills all but the heaviest males and females, say the top 10%—so their weights are around 450-500 kg. When these horses breed, their offspring would likely have a mean somewhere around the parents' mean, which is higher than 400. So the next generation's mean is higher than the original.

So the options are, looking again:

A: higher mean compared with original.

B: same as original.

C: lower than parents.

D: same as parents.

E: lower than original.

So the correct answer would be A, because the next generation's mean is higher than the original. But wait, the parents' mean is higher than the original. If the next generation's mean is the same as the parents' (option D), then the mean would be higher than the original. So option A says higher than original, and D says same as parents. So if the next generation's mean equals the parents', that would mean it's higher than the original, so both A and D could be correct in a way.

Wait, but the question is about the next generation compared to the original. So if the parents are the heaviest, their mean is higher, and if heritability is high, their kids' mean should be close to their parents. So the next generation's mean would be higher than the original, same as their parents. So in that case, option A would say higher than original, which is correct. Option D says same as parents, which would also mean higher than original. But the question is phrased as compared to the original population, so the correct answer would be A.

Alternatively, if the next generation has the same mean as their parents, then compared to the original, it's higher. So both A and D could be correct in that aspect. But looking at the possible options, perhaps I've misread something.

Wait, let me read the question again. It says, "the offspring of the next generation would be expected to have..." The options are about their mean weight compared to the original population or their parents.

Option A: higher than original.

Option D: same as parents.

So if the next generation's mean is same as their parents, which is higher than original, then A would be correct.

Wait, no. Suppose the original population has a mean of 400. Parents have a mean of 450. If the next generation has a mean of 450, then compared to the original, they're higher. So the correct answer would be A. But if the next generation's mean is the same as the parents', which is higher than the original, then option A is correct.

Wait, but another possibility: if the parents are the heaviest, and their offspring are also heavy, but maybe not as heavy as the parents. Because when you have a population with a certain distribution, even if you select the heaviest, their offspring will have a mean somewhere between the original mean and the parents' mean. Unless selection is perfect or heritability is 100%, the next generation may not reach the parents' mean.

But the question states that weight is highly heritable, so perhaps heritability is near 100%, so the offspring would be as heavy as the parents. In that case, the next generation's mean would be same as the parents', which is higher than the original. So the correct answer would be A (higher than original) and D (same as their parents). But looking at the options, A and D are separate.

Wait, the options are:

A: higher than original

D: same as parents.

So the next generation's mean would be same as parents, which is higher than the original. So the correct answer would be A, because the question is comparing to the original. Or wait, the options are about the next generation's mean. So if the next generation's mean is same as the parents, and the parents' mean is higher than the original, then the next generation's mean is higher than the original, so A is correct.

Alternatively, if the next generation's mean is same as the parents, which is higher than the original, then the correct answer would be A. But another possibility is that the next generation's mean is same as the parents, but that's option D, which is a different comparison.

Wait, the question is about the next generation compared to the original. So the correct answer is A.

Another thought: natural selection shifts the population mean in the direction of the selected trait. Since only heavy horses survived, the next generation would have a higher mean than before. So the answer is A.

The question involves a scenario where a volcanic eruption devastates a horse population on a large island, leaving only the heaviest males and females to survive. These survivors reproduce, and the question asks about the expected mean weight of the next generation compared to the original population. Weight is stated to be highly heritable, and the original population's weight distribution approximates a binomial distribution.

Key points to consider:

1. **Natural Selection and Heritability**: The surviving horses are the heaviest individuals, and since weight is highly heritable, their offspring are expected to inherit the genetic traits associated with higher weight. This suggests that the next generation will have a higher mean weight compared to the original population.

2. **Comparison to the Original Population**: The original population had a lower mean weight, while the surviving parents (heaviest individuals) have a higher mean weight. The next generation's mean weight will reflect the genetic contribution of these heavier parents, leading to an increase in the population's mean weight.

3. **Comparison to the Parents**: While the next generation's mean weight may not exceed the parents' mean weight, it will still be higher than the original population's mean weight. The question specifically asks about the comparison to the original population, not the parents.

Given these considerations, the next generation's mean weight is expected to be higher than that of the original population. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: a higher mean weight compared with members of the original population.**
