Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about team-based selling. Hmm, I'm not too familiar with this topic, but I'll try to think it through. Let's read the question again: The primary objective of team-based selling is to... and then there are options from A to J.

First, what do I know about team-based selling? I remember that in business, sometimes sales teams work in groups rather than individually. I guess this approach is used when dealing with large or complex accounts where one person can't handle everything alone. So, the idea is to have a team that can cover different aspects of the sale.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Equitably manage the sales bonus pool. That sounds more like an HR or finance concern, about how bonuses are distributed. I don't think that's the main goal of team selling.

Option B: Increase competitiveness within the sales team. Wait, if they're a team, I thought the idea was to collaborate, not compete. Maybe in some cases, but is that the primary objective? I'm not so sure.

Option C: Create multiple points of contact between the customer and the company. That makes sense. If a sales team has different members interacting with the customer, maybe each handling different parts, that could build stronger relationships. But is this the main goal?

Option D: Distribute the work involved in managing an account. That seems plausible. Managing a big account can be a lot of work, so a team would split the tasks. But is distribution the primary objective, or just a method to achieve something else?

Option E: Reduce the workload of individual salespeople. If you have a team, each person's workload might be shared, but I don't think that's the main reason companies adopt team selling. It's more about handling complex sales better than reducing individual load.

Option F: Ensure every team member interacts with the customer. That might happen, but I don't think it's the primary goal. Maybe some team members focus on behind-the-scenes work without direct customer interaction.

Option G: Diversify the company's customer base. That's more about marketing and expanding into new markets, not directly related to how the sales team is structured.

Option H: Match various functional areas of the company with customer needs. Oh, this sounds right. If the company has different departments or expertise areas, the sales team can include people from each area. For example, technical experts, account managers, customer service reps, etc., each addressing different customer needs. So the team can provide a more comprehensive solution by matching their functions to what the customer requires.

Option I: Simplify the sales negotiation process. Team selling might actually make negotiations more complex because more people are involved. So I don't think simplification is the goal.

Option J: Provide a single point of contact for the customer. That's the opposite of team-based selling. If it's a single point, then maybe it's more like an account manager, not a team approach.

So putting it all together, the primary objective is probably to match the company's various functional areas with the customer's needs. That way, each part of the customer's requirements can be addressed by the appropriate expert in the team. That makes the sales process more effective and comprehensive.

I think the correct answer is H.
