Question:

A plaintiff sued a defendant in federal court for injuries arising out of an accident involving the parties. The plaintiff alleged and presented evidence at trial demonstrating that her injuries had left her legs permanently paralyzed. The jury found in favor of the plaintiff and awarded her $5 million in damages. Two months after the court entered judgment, the defendant was given a videotape made that day showing the plaintiff jogging with her doctor. What is the best way for the defendant to seek relief from the judgment?

Options:

A: Move to set aside the verdict based on the new evidence that contradicts the plaintiff's claims.
B: Move for relief from the judgment on the ground that the plaintiff's injuries were not as severe as originally presented.
C: Move for a new trial or in the alternative for remittitur to reduce the award in light of the shortened duration of the plaintiff's injuries.
D: Move for relief from the judgment on the ground that the plaintiff misled the court about her condition.
E: Move for relief from the judgment on the ground that there is newly discovered evidence that the plaintiff's injuries were not permanent.
F: Request a retrial on the basis of newly discovered evidence that could alter the verdict.
G: Move for relief from the judgment on the ground that the plaintiff committed a fraud in obtaining damages for permanent injuries.
H: Move for relief from the judgment on the ground that the judgment was based on the jury's mistaken belief that the plaintiff's injuries would be permanent.
I: File an appeal with the appellate court alleging that the judgment was based on false information.
J: Move for relief from the judgment arguing that the jury's decision was influenced by emotional rather than factual reasoning.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question. Let me read it carefully. 

So, the situation is a plaintiff sued the defendant in federal court for injuries from an accident. The plaintiff said she had permanent paralysis in her legs and presented evidence at trial. The jury agreed and awarded her $5 million. Now, two months after the judgment, the defendant got a videotape showing the plaintiff jogging with her doctor. Hmm, that seems important.

The question is, what's the best way for the defendant to seek relief from the judgment? The options are A through J, each suggesting a different legal motion or argument.

I remember that after a judgment is entered, there are specific rules for trying to get it set aside or modified. One main rule I think is Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60, which allows for relief from a judgment or order under certain circumstances.

Rule 60 has several sections. The most common are 60(a) for clerical mistakes, 60(b) for other reasons like mistake, inadvertence, excusable neglect, fraud, etc., and 60(d) for other reasons not covered. Also, there's a time limit—usually one year for 60(b) motions, except for 60(b)(1), which is shorter.

In this case, the defendant wants to present new evidence that the plaintiff's injuries weren't permanent. So this is about new evidence that the defendant couldn't have discovered earlier. But wait, the video was made "that day"—I'm not sure if that means the day of the accident or the day of judgment. The question says the defendant was given the tape two months after the judgment. So, maybe the video is recent, showing the plaintiff can jog now, which contradicts the permanent paralysis claim.

If the evidence is newly discovered, the defendant might argue that this evidence couldn't have been found before the trial. So, perhaps a motion for a new trial under Rule 59, which allows for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence, but I think there's a time limit for that as well—usually within a certain number of days after judgment.

Wait, but two months have passed. Rule 59 motions must be served within 28 days after the entry of the judgment, so if two months have passed, that might be too late for a Rule 59 motion. Then, the defendant would have to look at Rule 60.

Rule 60(b)(2) deals with newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered before or during the trial. But there's a one-year time limit from the date of the judgment or order. Since two months have passed, the defendant is within that time frame.

Alternatively, if the defendant is alleging fraud, like the plaintiff misled the court about her condition, then Rule 60(b)(3) is about fraud by the opposing party. So, the defendant could argue that the plaintiff committed fraud by claiming permanent paralysis when she was actually not paralyzed.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Move to set aside the verdict based on new evidence contradicting claims. That sounds like it could be under Rule 60(b)(2) or (3).

Option B: Grounds that injuries were not as severe. That's more about the evidence they have now, but perhaps under 60(b)(2).

Option C: Move for a new trial or remittitur. Remittitur is when the court reduces the award. But if the evidence is new, maybe a new trial is better. But time might have run out for a new trial motion.

Option D: Misled the court about condition. That sounds like fraud, so 60(b)(3).

Option E: Newly discovered evidence about permanence. That fits 60(b)(2).

Option F: Retrial on new evidence. That's similar to a new trial, which might be too late.

Option G: Fraud in obtaining damages. So, fraud, which is 60(b)(3).

Option H: Judgment based on mistaken belief about permanence. That's more about the jury's mistake in belief, but if the plaintiff lied, it's fraud.

Option I: Appeal based on false info. An appeal is different; the defendant would have to file a notice of appeal within a certain time, but two months might be beyond that (depending on when the judgment was entered and the appeal period). Also, an appeal would argue that the trial court made an error, but this is about new evidence, so maybe a motion under Rule 60 is better.

Option J: Jury influenced by emotions. That's a different issue, perhaps about the damages being excessive, but not directly about the new evidence.

So, the defendant's best route is probably to file a Rule 60 motion. The options suggest either arguing newly discovered evidence or fraud.

Between E and G: E is about newly discovered evidence that injuries weren't permanent. G is about fraud.

If the plaintiff's condition improved, that might be a basis to say the original evidence was fraudulent. Alternatively, the new evidence shows the injuries weren't as claimed.

Wait, but if the plaintiff's legs were paralyzed, and now she's jogging, that could mean she was faking it. So, fraud. So, under Rule 60(b)(3), which deals with fraud.

But also, the defendant could argue that this is newly discovered evidence under (b)(2). So which is better?

Fraud is a strong ground because it goes to the integrity of the proceedings. Also, if the plaintiff misled the court about her condition, that's fraud, so option G or D.

Looking at the options, option G says "fraud in obtaining damages for permanent injuries." Option D says "misled about her condition."

Wait, the question is about what is the best way. So, if the plaintiff committed fraud by pretending to have permanent paralysis when she didn't, that would be a strong basis for relief.

So, the motion would be under Rule 60(b)(3), which is option G.

Alternatively, option E is about newly discovered evidence. So, which is more appropriate?

But wait, the issue is whether the plaintiff's condition was misrepresented. So, the defendant is alleging that the plaintiff's evidence was fraudulent. So, the ground would be fraud under Rule 60(b)(3).

So, the best option is G: Move for relief on the ground of fraud.

Alternatively, option E is about newly discovered evidence, but that's more about the evidence's nature, not fraud. So, E is 60(b)(2), G is 60(b)(3).

The question is, which is the better approach. If the defendant can show that the plaintiff intentionally misled the court, that's fraud. If it's just that new evidence shows the injuries weren't permanent, that's newly discovered evidence.

In this case, the defendant has a videotape showing the plaintiff jogging, which directly contradicts the claim of permanent paralysis. So, that's strong evidence. Whether that's due to the plaintiff committing fraud or just new evidence.

So, the options are E and G.

Looking at the options again:

Option E: Newly discovered evidence that injuries weren't permanent.

Option G: Fraud in obtaining damages for permanent injuries.

I think the defendant would go with fraud because that's a stronger ground for setting aside the judgment. Also, under Rule 60(b)(3), the defendant can argue that the judgment was obtained through fraud.

So, the best answer is either E or G. But I think G is more precise because it's about the fraud, which is a more serious allegation and a valid ground for relief.

Alternatively, if the plaintiff's condition genuinely improved, maybe the defendant could argue that the evidence at trial was incorrect, but without fraud, it's just a change in condition. But the question is that the plaintiff presented evidence of permanent paralysis, and the video shows otherwise. So, it's possible that the plaintiff was faking it, hence fraud.

So, I think the right answer is G.
</think>

The defendant seeks relief from a judgment where the plaintiff was awarded $5 million for injuries allegedly causing permanent paralysis. Two months after the judgment, the defendant obtained a videotape showing the plaintiff jogging, which directly contradicts the claim of permanent paralysis. The question asks for the best legal route to seek relief.

Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60, relief from a judgment can be sought for reasons such as newly discovered evidence (60(b)(2)) or fraud (60(b)(3)). Here, the videotape constitutes new evidence, but the key issue is whether the plaintiff intentionally misled the court about her condition, which would constitute fraud. 

- **Option A** and **Option B** focus on new evidence but do not address the potential fraud.  
- **Option C** suggests a new trial or remittitur, but the time limit for a new trial motion under Rule 59 has likely expired.  
- **Option D** alleges misleading the court but does not explicitly invoke fraud.  
- **Option E** focuses on newly discovered evidence, which is valid but less robust than alleging fraud.  
- **Option F** suggests retrial, which is unlikely due to the time elapsed.  
- **Option G** explicitly alleges fraud under Rule 60(b)(3), which is a stronger and more precise ground for relief.  
- **Option H** focuses on the jury's mistaken belief but does not address the plaintiff's potential fraud.  
- **Option I** involves an appeal, which is less appropriate for new evidence.  
- **Option J** focuses on emotional influence, which is irrelevant to the new evidence.

The best approach is to argue fraud under Rule 60(b)(3), as the videotape strongly suggests the plaintiff misled the court about her condition. This makes **Option G** the most appropriate choice.

Answer: G
