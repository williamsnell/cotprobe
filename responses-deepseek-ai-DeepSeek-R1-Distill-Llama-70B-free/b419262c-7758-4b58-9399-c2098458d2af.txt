Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about marketing channels and intermediaries. Hmm, I remember from my studies that companies use different distribution strategies. The question is about giving intermediaries exclusive rights to market a product in a specific territory, using very few intermediaries.

Wait, let me think. I've heard terms like intensive, selective, and exclusive distribution. Intensive distribution is when you have as many outlets as possible, like for things like candies or newspapers. That's not this case because the question says a limited number of intermediaries.

Selective distribution uses a moderate number of outlets. It's more than intensive but not exclusive. So, it's not that either. Then there's exclusive distribution, where only a few intermediaries are used, often given exclusive rights in certain areas. Oh, right, that's probably it. So the term would be exclusive distribution.

Looking at the options, option B is Exclusive. So the answer should be B.

The correct answer is B: Exclusive. This refers to a distribution strategy where intermediaries are granted exclusive rights to market a product in a defined territory, using a limited number of intermediaries.
