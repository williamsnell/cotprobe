Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about average acceleration. Hmm, let me think. The question says an automobile accelerates from 15 mi/hr to 45 mi/hr in 10 seconds. I need to find the average acceleration. The options are all in ft/sec², so I'll probably need to convert the units.

Wait, average acceleration is just the change in velocity over the change in time, right? Oh yeah, that formula is a = (v_final - v_initial) / t. But wait, the units are in miles per hour and the answer needs to be in feet per second squared. So I need to convert those speeds into feet per second first.

So, let me remember the conversion factors. I think 1 mile is 5280 feet, and 1 hour is 3600 seconds. So to convert miles per hour to feet per second, I multiply by 5280/3600. Let me calculate that fraction. 5280 divided by 3600. Let me see, 5280 ÷ 3600. Well, 3600 goes into 5280 once with 1680 left over. 1680 divided by 3600 is 0.4666... So the conversion factor is approximately 1.4667 ft/s per mph.

So, for 15 mi/hr: 15 * 1.4667 = let me calculate that. 15 times 1 is 15, 15 times 0.4667 is about 7. So 15 +7=22? Wait, wait, no. Wait, 1.4667 times 15. Let me do it step by step. 10 times 1.4667 is 14.667, and 5 times is 7.3335. So adding them gives 14.667 +7.3335 = 22.0005 ft/s. Oh, so approximately 22 ft/s.

Similarly, 45 mi/hr: 45 * 1.4667. Let me calculate that. 40 times 1.4667 is 58.668, and 5 times is 7.3335. So 58.668 +7.3335 = 66.0015 ft/s. So approximately 66 ft/s.

So the change in velocity is final minus initial: 66 -22 = 44 ft/s. The time is 10 seconds. So acceleration a is 44 /10 = 4.4 ft/s². Oh wait, let me check the options. Option C is 4.4 ft/s². So the answer should be C.

But wait, I should double-check my calculations. Maybe I made a mistake in unit conversion. Let's recalculate the conversion factor. 5280 ft per mile, 3600 seconds per hour. So 5280/3600 = 5280 ÷ 3600. Let me compute that. 5280 divided by 3600. 

Divide numerator and denominator by 100: 52.8 / 36. Then 52.8 ÷36. 36 times 1.4 is 50.4, because 36*1=36, 36*0.4=14.4, so 36*1.4=50.4. 52.8 -50.4 is 2.4. 2.4 /36 is 0.06666... So 1.4 + 0.06666 = 1.46666... So that's correct. So 1.46667 ft/s per mph.

So 15 mph: 15 * 1.46667. Let me compute it more accurately. 15 * 1.46667. 10*1.46667=14.6667, 5*1.46667=7.33335. Adding gives 21.99995, which is about 22.0 ft/s. Similarly, 45 mph: 45*1.46667. Let's calculate 40*1.46667=58.6668, 5*1.46667=7.33335. Sum is 65.99995, approximately 66.0 ft/s. So delta v is 44 ft/s over 10 seconds: 44/10=4.4. So the answer is C.

To determine the average acceleration of the automobile, we use the formula for average acceleration:

\[
a = \frac{v_{\text{final}} - v_{\text{initial}}}{t}
\]

The given speeds are in miles per hour (mi/hr), but the answer requires units of feet per second squared (ft/s²). To convert mi/hr to ft/s, we use the conversion factor:

\[
1 \, \text{mi/hr} = \frac{5280 \, \text{ft}}{3600 \, \text{s}} \approx 1.4667 \, \text{ft/s}
\]

### Step 1: Convert speeds to ft/s
- Initial speed: \( 15 \, \text{mi/hr} \times 1.4667 \, \text{ft/s per mi/hr} \approx 22.0 \, \text{ft/s} \)
- Final speed: \( 45 \, \text{mi/hr} \times 1.4667 \, \text{ft/s per mi/hr} \approx 66.0 \, \text{ft/s} \)

### Step 2: Calculate the change in velocity
\[
\Delta v = v_{\text{final}} - v_{\text{initial}} = 66.0 \, \text{ft/s} - 22.0 \, \text{ft/s} = 44.0 \, \text{ft/s}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the average acceleration
\[
a = \frac{\Delta v}{t} = \frac{44.0 \, \text{ft/s}}{10 \, \text{s}} = 4.4 \, \text{ft/s}^2
\]

### Final Answer:
The average acceleration is **4.4 ft/s²**, which corresponds to option **C**.
