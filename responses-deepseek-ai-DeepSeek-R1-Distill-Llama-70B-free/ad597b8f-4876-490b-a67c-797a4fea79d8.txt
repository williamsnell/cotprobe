Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about equilibrium constants and concentrations. Hmm, let's see what it's asking.

The reaction is A + B ⇌ C + D. The first part says that when 0.7 moles of C are formed starting from 1 mole each of A and B, I need to find the equilibrium constant. And then, for the same equilibrium, find the composition when starting with 1 mole each of A, B, C, and D initially.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Oh right, the setup for the first part: initial amounts are 1 mole A and 1 mole B, and no C or D. So they react to form C and D until equilibrium is reached. At that point, 0.7 moles of C have formed. So I can set up an ICE table to find the equilibrium concentrations.

ICE table: Initial, Change, Equilibrium.

Let's assume the reaction occurs in a certain volume, but since the volume isn't given, I'll assume it's 1 liter so moles equal molarity.

Initially:
[A] = 1 M
[B] = 1 M
[C] = 0
[D] = 0

Change:
Let x be the amount of A and B that react. So for each mole of A consumed, one mole of C and D are produced. Wait, the stoichiometry is 1:1 for all.

So, the change would be:
A: -x
B: -x
C: +x
D: +x

At equilibrium, the concentrations would be:
[A] = 1 - x
[B] = 1 - x
[C] = x
[D] = x

But wait, the problem says 0.7 moles of C are formed. Since the volume is 1L, that's 0.7 M. So x = 0.7.

Wait, but then 1 - x would be 0.3 for [A] and [B]. That seems a bit low, but let's see.

The equilibrium constant K is [C][D]/([A][B]) = (0.7)(0.7)/(0.3 * 0.3) )= (0.49)/(0.09) ≈ 5.444...

So K would be about 5.44. Looking at the options, option F says K is 5.44. So that's the first part.

Hmm, but wait, the question is about two scenarios. The first part is finding K when starting with 1 mole A and 1 mole B, which gives C formed as 0.7. So K is 5.44, which is option F's K.

The second part asks for the equilibrium composition when starting with 1 mole each of A, B, C, D. So initial concentrations are all 1 M.

I need to set up another ICE table for this case.

Reaction: A + B ⇌ C + D

Initial:
[A] = 1
[B] = 1
[C] = 1
[D] = 1

Change: Let y be the change. Since the system is at equilibrium, some of C and D might convert back to A and B.

So, the changes would be:
A: +y
B: +y
C: -y
D: -y

Wait, no. Wait, the initial is 1 mole each of all four. The reaction can proceed in either direction. If K is 5.44, which is greater than 1, the reaction favors products. But when all four are present, the system may shift towards the side which reduces the stress. Hmm, but if K is 5.44, the reaction quotient Q is (1*1)/(1*1)=1. Since Q < K, the reaction will proceed forward, consuming A and B to make more C and D.

Wait, no, wait. If the initial concentrations are all 1, then Q = [C][D]/([A][B]) = (1)(1)/(1*1)=1. Since K is 5.44, which is larger than Q, the reaction will proceed forward to reach equilibrium. So A and B will decrease, C and D will increase.

Let me set up the ICE table correctly. Because K is greater than Q, the reaction shifts to the right.

So, the change would be: A and B decrease by y, C and D increase by y.

Wait, no. Wait, if the reaction shifts forward, it's because the system is producing more C and D. So for every mole of A and B consumed, a mole of C and D is produced.

Wait, but in this case, since initial concentrations are all 1, and the system is not at equilibrium, it will shift right to make more products.

So let me define the change as follows:

Let y be the amount of A and B that react to form C and D.

Then,

[A] = 1 - y
[B] = 1 - y
[C] = 1 + y
[D] = 1 + y

Now, the equilibrium expression is:

K = ([C][D])/([A][B]) = ( (1+y)^2 ) / ( (1 - y)^2 ) ) = 5.44

Take the square root of both sides: (1 + y)/(1 - y) = sqrt(5.44)

What's sqrt(5.44)? Let me calculate. 5.44 is between 5 (2.236^2=5) and 5.44. 2.33^2 is 5.4289, which is approximately 5.44. So sqrt(5.44)≈2.33.

So (1+y)/(1 - y) ≈ 2.33

Let me solve for y.

Multiply both sides by (1 - y):

1 + y = 2.33(1 - y)

1 + y = 2.33 - 2.33 y

Bring all terms to left:

y + 2.33 y = 2.33 -1

(3.33)y = 1.33 → y ≈ 1.33 /3.33 → approximately 0.4.

Wait, that's an approximation. Let's do it more accurately.

K = 5.44 → sqrt(5.44)= approx 2.33.

So,

1 + y = 2.33*(1 - y)

Expand RHS: 2.33 - 2.33 y

Bring y terms to left:

y + 2.33 y = 2.33 -1 → 3.33 y = 1.33 → y = 1.33/3.33

Calculating 1.33 /3.33 = 0.4 exactly? Wait, 3.33 times 0.4 is 1.332, so 0.4 is correct.

So y=0.4.

So the equilibrium concentrations are:

[A] = 1 - y = 0.6 M

[B] = 0.6 M

[C] = 1 + y = 1.4 M

[D] = 1.4 M

Now, looking back at the options, option F's second part says concentrations of A and B are 0.6 M, and C and D 1.4 M. So yes, that's option F.

So the correct answer is option F: K is 5.44, [A]=[B]=0.6, [C]=[D]=1.4.

To solve the problem, we analyze the equilibrium reaction **A + B ⇌ C + D** in two scenarios:

### Part 1: Finding the equilibrium constant \( K \)
Initially, 1 mole each of A and B are present, and no C or D. At equilibrium, 0.7 moles of C are formed. Using the stoichiometry of the reaction, the equilibrium concentrations are:
- \([A] = [B] = 1 - 0.7 = 0.3 \, \text{M}\)
- \([C] = [D] = 0.7 \, \text{M}\)

The equilibrium constant \( K \) is calculated as:
\[
K = \frac{[C][D]}{[A][B]} = \frac{(0.7)(0.7)}{(0.3)(0.3)} = \frac{0.49}{0.09} \approx 5.44
\]

### Part 2: Finding the equilibrium composition when starting with 1 mole each of A, B, C, and D
Initially, all concentrations are 1 M. Since \( K = 5.44 \), the reaction shifts forward (as \( K > Q \), where \( Q = 1 \)) to produce more C and D. Let \( y \) represent the amount of A and B consumed, and the amount of C and D produced. The equilibrium concentrations are:
- \([A] = [B] = 1 - y\)
- \([C] = [D] = 1 + y\)

Substituting into the equilibrium expression:
\[
K = \frac{[C][D]}{[A][B]} = \frac{(1+y)^2}{(1-y)^2}
\]
Taking the square root:
\[
\frac{1+y}{1-y} = \sqrt{K} = \sqrt{5.44} \approx 2.33
\]
Solving for \( y \):
\[
1 + y = 2.33(1 - y) \quad \Rightarrow \quad 1 + y = 2.33 - 2.33y
\]
\[
3.33y = 1.33 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y \approx 0.4
\]

The equilibrium concentrations are:
- \([A] = [B] = 1 - y = 0.6 \, \text{M}\)
- \([C] = [D] = 1 + y = 1.4 \, \text{M}\)

### Final Answer
The equilibrium constant is \( K = 5.44 \), and the equilibrium composition is:
- \([A] = [B] = 0.6 \, \text{M}\)
- \([C] = [D] = 1.4 \, \text{M}\)

This matches **Option F**.
