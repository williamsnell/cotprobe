Okay, so I have this problem where I need to round the number 0.1476 to different decimal places. Let me see. I'm a bit nervous about rounding, but I think I can handle it by breaking it down step by step.

First, the question is asking to round to three different places: part (a) to two decimal places, part (b) to three, and part (c) to one. I'll tackle each part one by one.

Starting with part (a), rounding to two decimal places. The number is 0.1476. So, when I round to two decimals, I look at the third decimal place to decide whether to round up or keep it the same. The third decimal here is 7. Since 7 is greater than or equal to 5, I round the second decimal up. The second decimal is 4, so adding 1 makes it 5. So the number becomes 0.15. Wait, does that make sense? Let me double-check. 0.1476 → after rounding the third decimal (7), which is over 5, so yes, 0.15.

Next, part (b), rounding to three decimal places. The number is 0.1476. To round to three decimals, I look at the fourth decimal place, which is 6. Since 6 is greater than or equal to 5, I round the third decimal up. The third decimal is 7, adding 1 makes it 8. So it becomes 0.148. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the number is 0.1476. Oh wait, no, the third decimal is 7, and the next digit is 6. So adding 1 to the third place. 7+1 is 8. So yes, 0.148. So part (b) is 0.148.

Then, part (c), rounding to one decimal place. The number is 0.1476. So I look at the second decimal place to decide. The second decimal is 4, which is less than 5. So I don't round up. So the first decimal stays as 1, making it 0.1. Wait, no, wait a second. Wait, the first decimal is 1, the second is 4. Wait, no, when rounding to one decimal, you look at the next digit (the second decimal). So 0.1476: the first decimal is 1, second is 4. Since 4 <5, you leave it as 0.1. So part (c) is 0.1.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. So for part (c), it's one decimal place, so only one digit after the decimal point. So 0.1, because the next digit is 4, which is less than 5, so it doesn't round up. So yes, 0.1 is correct.

Now, looking at the options to see which one matches these results.

Looking at the options provided:

Option A: (a) .15, (b) .148, (c) .1 → This matches what I got for all parts. So A is a possibility.

Option B: (a) .15, (b) .147, (c) .14 → (b) is 147, but I thought (b) should be 148 because of the 6 in the fourth place. So B is wrong.

Option C: (a) .14, which is not correct because (a) should be .15. So C is out.

Option D: (a) .14, which is wrong again. So D is out.

Option E: (a) .15, (b) .149. Wait, why .149? Because in part (b), the third decimal is 7, next digit 6. So 7+1=8. So (b) should be .148. So E's (b) is .149, which doesn't match. So E is wrong.

Option F: (a) .14, which is wrong. So F is out.

Option G: (a) .15, (b) .147. Wait, no, because (b) should be .148. So G is wrong.

Option H: (a) .15, (b) .149. Again, (b) is wrong, so H is out.

Option I: (a) .14, which is wrong. So I is wrong.

Option J: (a) .14, which is wrong. So J is out.

So the only correct option is A.

To solve the problem of rounding **0.1476** to the specified decimal places:

### Part (a): Rounding to 2 decimal places
- The number is **0.1476**.
- Look at the third decimal place (7). Since 7 ≥ 5, round the second decimal (4) up by 1, making it 5.
- Result: **0.15**.

### Part (b): Rounding to 3 decimal places
- The number is **0.1476**.
- Look at the fourth decimal place (6). Since 6 ≥ 5, round the third decimal (7) up by 1, making it 8.
- Result: **0.148**.

### Part (c): Rounding to 1 decimal place
- The number is **0.1476**.
- Look at the second decimal place (4). Since 4 < 5, the first decimal (1) remains unchanged.
- Result: **0.1**.

### Matching with the options:
- **Option A**: (a) 0.15, (b) 0.148, (c) 0.1 — **Correct**.
- Other options either have incorrect values for one or more parts.

### Final Answer:
A
