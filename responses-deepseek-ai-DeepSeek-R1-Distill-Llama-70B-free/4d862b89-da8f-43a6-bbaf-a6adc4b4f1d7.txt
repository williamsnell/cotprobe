Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem. Let me see what it's about.

The question is about whether the normal force from the floor does work on a man standing in an elevator as it ascends. Hmm, I remember that work is done when a force causes a displacement. The formula for work is W = F * d * cos(theta), where theta is the angle between the force and displacement.

So the man is in an elevator that's moving upwards. The normal force is what's exerted by the floor on the man, right? That force is perpendicular to the floor, so it's pointing upwards. The man's displacement is also upwards as the elevator moves. Wait, no, wait. Wait, the normal force is perpendicular to the surface. If the elevator is moving straight up, the normal force is also vertical, in the same direction as the displacement.

Wait, but wait. When the elevator is moving, like accelerating upwards or just moving at constant speed, the normal force might change. But in this case, the question is just about whether work is done, not the amount. 

So work is force times displacement times cosine theta. Theta here is the angle between the normal force and the displacement. Since both are in the same direction (upwards), theta is zero degrees. Cos(0) is 1, so that's positive.

But wait, does the normal force actually cause the displacement? Or is it just the elevator moving? So the man is moving because the elevator is moving. The normal force is from the floor, so as the elevator accelerates upwards, the normal force would be greater than the man's weight. But in any case, when the elevator is moving, the man moves with it.

So the displacement is in the same direction as the normal force. So the work done should be positive. So that would be option A: Yes, and the work done will be positive.

Wait, but another thought: The normal force is exerted by the elevator floor on the man. As the elevator moves upward, the man moves with it. So the point of application of the normal force (the man's feet) is moving upward along with the elevator. So the force and displacement are in the same direction. So yes, work is done.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Another approach: think about when the elevator is moving. If the man is moving up, and the normal force is pushing up on him, then yes, the force is in the direction of displacement. So work is positive.

But wait, sometimes in elevators, the normal force does no work because when you're moving at constant speed, the normal force equals your weight, but does it do work? Because the displacement is upwards, and the force is upwards, so yes, work is done.

Wait, but another thought: In physics, when you're considering work done by the normal force, which is a contact force, sometimes it's considered that the normal force doesn't do work in certain situations. Like, when you're lifting something, the normal force (from your hands) does work. But wait, in this case, the elevator is moving, so the man's feet are in contact with the floor, and both are moving.

Wait, another angle: The normal force is exerted by the elevator floor. As the elevator moves upwards, the point where the normal force is applied (the man's feet) also moves upwards. So the force and displacement are in the same direction, so work is done. So the answer would be A.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option C says no because the normal force and displacement are perpendicular. That's not right because both are vertical.

Option D says no because the man isn't moving relative to the elevator. But work is about the displacement in the same direction as the force. So even if he's not moving relative to the elevator, the elevator itself is moving, so from an external frame, the man is moving upward, so the normal force is doing work.

Wait, but wait—if the man is moving up with the elevator, and the normal force is also upwards, then the work done is positive, right?

So the answer should be A: Yes, positive work.

Wait, but I'm a bit shaky. Let me think about another example. Suppose I push a box across the floor. The normal force is upward, displacement is horizontal. So work done by normal force is zero because the angle is 90 degrees. But in this elevator case, the displacement is vertical and the force is vertical.

So yes, in this case, the normal force does work.

Wait, but I'm getting a conflicting thought. I remember that in some cases, like when you're in an elevator accelerating upwards, the normal force is greater than mg, but the work done is still based on the displacement and the force.

Wait, but what about the work done by the normal force? If the elevator is moving upward, and the normal force is acting upward, then the work should be positive.

So the correct answer would be A: Yes, and the work done will be positive.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option C says no because the forces are perpendicular. That's not correct because they are in the same direction.

Wait, another thought: The normal force from the floor on the man is what's keeping him from accelerating through the floor. When the elevator accelerates upward, the normal force is more than his weight. But in terms of work, the displacement is in the same direction as the normal force.

So the work done should be positive. So the correct answer is A.

Wait, but wait—another point. Some might argue that the normal force doesn't do work because it's a conservative force. Wait, but wait, that's option B. No, because the normal force is a conservative force. But that's not correct reasoning. The fact that a force is conservative doesn't mean it does no work. For example, gravity is a conservative force and does work. So B is incorrect.

So, putting it all together, the answer should be A.

The question asks whether the normal force from the floor does work on the man as the elevator ascends. To determine this, we analyze the situation using the formula for work: 

\[
W = F \cdot d \cdot \cos(\theta)
\]

where \( F \) is the force, \( d \) is the displacement, and \( \theta \) is the angle between the force and displacement. The normal force exerted by the floor is vertical (upward), and as the elevator ascends, the man's displacement is also vertical (upward). Since both the normal force and the displacement are in the same direction, the angle \( \theta \) is \( 0^\circ \), and \( \cos(0^\circ) = 1 \). This means the work done by the normal force is positive.

Key points to consider:
1. The normal force acts upward, and the displacement is also upward, so they are not perpendicular. This rules out option C.
2. The fact that the man is not moving relative to the elevator does not matter because work is determined in the external frame of reference, where the man and the elevator are moving upward together. This rules out option D.
3. The normal force is not inherently a force that does no work simply because it is conservative. Conservative forces, such as gravity, can do work. This rules out option B.
4. The normal force does work because it acts in the same direction as the displacement, making the work positive.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**A: Yes, and the work done will be positive.**
