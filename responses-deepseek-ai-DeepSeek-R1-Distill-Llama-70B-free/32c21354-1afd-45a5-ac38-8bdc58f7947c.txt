Okay, so I have this problem here about tiling a floor and calculating the cost. Hmm, let me read it again. The question is: How many 9-inch-by-9-inch tiles are needed to cover a floor that's 9 feet long and 6 feet wide? Then, find the cost if each tile costs 75 cents. The options are A through J.

First, I think I need to figure out the area of the floor and the area of one tile. Then, divide the floor area by the tile area to find out how many tiles are needed. But wait, the units are different. The floor is in feet, and the tiles are in inches. Oh right, I should convert everything to the same unit system. Let's convert feet to inches because the tiles are in inches.

I remember that 1 foot is 12 inches. So, the floor is 9 feet long. 9 feet times 12 inches per foot equals... 9*12 is 108 inches. And the width is 6 feet, so 6*12 is 72 inches. So the floor is 108 inches by 72 inches.

Now, the area of the floor is length multiplied by width. So 108 inches * 72 inches. Let me calculate that. 100*72 is 7200, and 8*72 is 576, so 7200+576 is 7776 square inches. Okay, so floor area is 7776 square inches.

Each tile is 9 inches by 9 inches. So the area of one tile is 9*9, which is 81 square inches.

To find the number of tiles needed, I divide the floor area by the tile area. So 7776 / 81. Let's see, 81 times 96 is 7776 because 81*90 is 7290, and 81*6 is 486. 7290+486 is 7776. So that's 96 tiles.

Wait, but sometimes you might need to round up because you can't have a fraction of a tile. But in this case, 7776 is exactly divisible by 81, so no problem. So 96 tiles.

Now, the cost. Each tile is 75 cents. 96 tiles multiplied by $0.75. Let me calculate that. 96 * 0.75. Hmm, 75 cents is three quarters, so 96 * 3/4 is 72. So $72.

Looking at the options, option E is 96 tiles, $72.00. So the answer should be E.

Wait, let me double-check. Floor area: 9ft=108in, 6ft=72in. 108*72 = 7776. Tile area 9*9=81. 7776/81=96. Cost 96*.75=72. Yep, that's correct.

The floor dimensions are 9 feet by 6 feet, which convert to 108 inches by 72 inches. The area of the floor is 108 × 72 = 7776 square inches. Each tile is 9 inches by 9 inches, so the area of one tile is 81 square inches. Dividing the floor area by the tile area gives 7776 ÷ 81 = 96 tiles. At 75 cents per tile, the total cost is 96 × $0.75 = $72.00. 

The correct option is E: 96 tiles, $72.00.
