Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the heat of formation of methane, CH4(g), using some given reactions and their enthalpy changes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The reaction I need is the formation of methane from graphite and hydrogen gas: C(graphite) + 2H2(g) → CH4(g). I'm supposed to find the ΔH° for this reaction using the provided reactions.

The given reactions and their ΔH° values are:

1. CH4(g) + 2O2(g) → CO2(g) + 2H2O(l)    ΔH° = -212.80 kcal/mol
2. C(graphite) + Cl2(g) → CCl2(g)        ΔH° = -94.05 kcal/mol (Wait, wait, wait. Oh no, wait, the second reaction is C(graphite) + O2(g) → CO2(g)? Or wait, the user said the reactions are: the second one is C(graphite) + C2(g) → CO2(g) with ΔH° = -94.05. Hmm, that seems a bit odd. Wait, maybe I'm misreading. Let me check again.

Wait, the user provided the second reaction as: C(graphite) + C2(g) → CO2(g) ΔH° = -94.05. Oh, wait, maybe that's a typo? Because C2(g) isn't something I'm familiar with. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo and it should be O2(g), since CO2 has oxygen. Hmm, but the user wrote C2, so perhaps that's correct. Or maybe it's a typo, and I should proceed as if it's C + O2 → CO2, which would make more sense. Because otherwise, I'm not sure how C2(g) would react with graphite to form CO2. Alternatively, maybe the equation is C(graphite) + O2(g) → CO2(g), and ΔH is -94.05.

Wait, but the user wrote C(graphite) + C2(g) → CO2(g), so I need to take that as given. Hmm, but perhaps I should proceed under the assumption that it's a typo and it's O2. Because otherwise, I can't see how to use that reaction. Alternatively, perhaps C2 is a typo and it's O2.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed as if the second reaction is C(graphite) + O2(g) → CO2(g) with ΔH° = -94.05 kcal/mol. That would make more sense because that's a standard formation reaction.

Wait, but maybe I should read the question again exactly as written. The second reaction is C(graphite) + C2(g) → CO2(g), ΔH° = -94.05. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo and it's supposed to be C + O2 → CO2. Let's proceed with that assumption because otherwise I'm stuck.

So, the third reaction is H2(g) + ½ O2(g) → H2O(l), ΔH° = -68.32 kcal/mol.

Now, I need to find the ΔH° for the formation of CH4 from graphite and H2.

Formation reactions usually start from elements in their standard states. So, for CH4, the formation reaction is C(graphite) + 2 H2(g) → CH4(g).

I think I can use Hess's Law here, which allows me to combine the given reactions to get the desired reaction. So, I need to manipulate the given reactions to add up to the target reaction.

Let me write down the target reaction:

C(graphite) + 2 H2(g) → CH4(g)          ΔH° = ?

I need to find the ΔH° for this. Let's see how to get this using the given reactions.

First, looking at reaction 1: CH4 + 2 O2 → CO2 + 2 H2O, ΔH = -212.80 kcal/mol. Hmm, that's combustion of methane. Maybe I can reverse this reaction to get the formation of methane.

So, reversing reaction 1 gives: CO2 + 2 H2O → CH4 + 2 O2, ΔH° = +212.80 kcal/mol.

If I do that, I have CO2 and H2O on the reactant side. But I need to get C(graphite) and H2 on the reactant side. Hmm.

Wait, the target reaction is C + 2 H2 → CH4. So, perhaps I can find reactions that produce C and H2, then combine them.

Alternatively, perhaps I should break down the given reactions into their formation reactions.

Reaction 2 (as I'm assuming with the typo) is C(graphite) + O2 → CO2(g), ΔH° = -94.05 kcal/mol. That's the formation of CO2 from graphite and O2.

Reaction 3 is H2 + ½ O2 → H2O(l), ΔH = -68.32. So, that's the formation of H2O(l).

So, to get the target reaction, maybe I can reverse reaction 1, and then use the other reactions to cancel out the CO2 and H2O.

Let me think: the target is C + 2 H2 → CH4.

If I reverse reaction 1: CO2 + 2 H2O → CH4 + 2 O2, ΔH = +212.80.

Then, I can subtract the formation reactions of CO2 and H2O to eliminate those species.

So, the idea is to write the target reaction as [reverse reaction 1] minus [formation reactions of CO2 and H2O].

Let me try to write that.

Desired reaction: C + 2 H2 → CH4.

Let me write the reverse of reaction 1:

CO2 + 2 H2O → CH4 + 2 O2      ΔH = +212.80.

Now, I can subtract the formation of CO2 and the formation of H2O.

Formation of CO2: C + O2 → CO2, ΔH = -94.05.

Formation of H2O: H2 + ½ O2 → H2O, ΔH = -68.32.

But since in the reverse reaction, CO2 and H2O are reactants, I need to subtract their formation reactions. So, in other words, subtract (CO2 → C + O2) and (H2O → H2 + ½ O2) to eliminate CO2 and H2O.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me approach this systematically.

The target is:

C + 2 H2 → CH4.

I have:

1. Reverse reaction 1: CO2 + 2 H2O → CH4 + 2 O2 ; ΔH = +212.80.

But I need to get rid of CO2 and H2O. So, I can subtract the reactions that produce CO2 and H2O.

So, the formation reactions of CO2 and H2O are:

a) C + O2 → CO2 ; ΔH = -94.05.

b) H2 + ½ O2 → H2O ; ΔH = -68.32.

Since in the reversed reaction 1, CO2 and H2O are on the left (reactants), I can subtract their formation reactions to move them to the product side. Wait no, subtraction of a reaction would mean reversing it.

Alternatively, perhaps I should write the decomposition reactions.

Wait, perhaps I can think of the reverse of reaction a and reaction b.

The reverse of reaction a (CO2 → C + O2) would have ΔH = +94.05.

Similarly, the reverse of reaction b (H2O → H2 + ½ O2) would have ΔH = +68.32.

So, if I take the reversed reaction 1 and then subtract the reversed a and reversed b, I can eliminate CO2 and H2O.

Wait, let me try:

Reversed reaction 1: CO2 + 2 H2O → CH4 + 2 O2; ΔH = +212.80.

Then, subtract (CO2 → C + O2; ΔH = +94.05) and 2*(H2O → H2 + ½ O2; ΔH = +68.32 each).

So, the overall process would be:

[CO2 + 2 H2O → CH4 + 2 O2]  
minus [CO2 → C + O2]  
minus 2 [H2O → H2 + ½ O2]

Let me write this as:

CO2 + 2 H2O → CH4 + 2 O2  
CO2 → C + O2  (subtracting, so it becomes C + O2 → CO2, but with a negative sign)  
H2O → H2 + ½ O2 (subtracting, so becomes H2 + ½ O2 → H2O, but negative)

Wait, maybe it's easier to write each step. Let me perform the subtraction.

Let me represent each reaction:

1. CO2 + 2 H2O → CH4 + 2 O2 ; ΔH = +212.80.

Then, for each CO2 and H2O in the reactants, I subtract their formation reactions.

So, for CO2, the formation is C + O2 → CO2, ΔH = -94.05. So, the reverse is CO2 → C + O2, ΔH = +94.05.

Similarly, for each H2O, the formation is H2 + ½ O2 → H2O, ΔH = -68.32. So, the reverse is H2O → H2 + ½ O2, ΔH = +68.32.

So, if I have two H2O molecules, I subtract 2*(H2O → H2 + ½ O2).

So, the overall steps are:

a) Start with CO2 + 2 H2O → CH4 + 2 O2    ΔH = +212.80.

b) Subtract (CO2 → C + O2) → which is the same as adding C + O2 → CO2, but with the sign changed.

Wait, no. When subtracting reactions, you reverse them and add them.

So, the correct approach is:

Target = (Reversed reaction 1) + (Reversed reaction a) + 2*(Reversed reaction b).

Wait, perhaps it's better to represent this with algebraic manipulation.

Let me write all the reactions:

Reversed reaction 1: CO2 + 2 H2O → CH4 + 2 O2 ; ΔH1 = +212.80.

Reversed reaction a: CO2 → C + O2 ; ΔH2 = +94.05.

Reversed reaction b: H2O → H2 + ½ O2 ; ΔH3 = +68.32.

Wait, no. If I subtract the formation reactions (a and b), I'm effectively adding their reverses.

So, Target = Reversed reaction 1 + Reversed a + 2*Reversed b.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to write each step.

The desired reaction is C + 2 H2 → CH4.

I can start with the reversed reaction 1:

CO2 + 2 H2O → CH4 + 2 O2 ; ΔH = +212.80.

Now, I need to eliminate CO2 and H2O. To do that, I can subtract the reactions that form CO2 and H2O.

Reaction a is C + O2 → CO2 ; ΔH = -94.05.

If I reverse reaction a, I get CO2 → C + O2 ; ΔH = +94.05.

Similarly, reaction b is H2 + ½ O2 → H2O ; ΔH = -68.32.

Reversing reaction b gives H2O → H2 + ½ O2 ; ΔH = +68.32.

Since I have two H2O molecules, I need to reverse reaction b twice.

So, adding the reversed reaction a and twice reversed reaction b to the reversed reaction 1.

So, the overall reaction becomes:

CO2 + 2 H2O → CH4 + 2 O2  
CO2 → C + O2  
2 H2O → 2 H2 + O2.

Wait, no. Because if I add reversed reaction a and 2 reversed reaction b, I get:

Reversed reaction 1: CO2 + 2 H2O → CH4 + 2 O2.

Plus reversed a: CO2 → C + O2.

Plus 2*(reversed b): 2 H2O → 2 H2 + O2.

Wait, but I'm adding these reactions together, so I can sum them up.

Let me add them:

CO2 + 2 H2O → CH4 + 2 O2  
CO2 → C + O2  
2 H2O → 2 H2 + O2.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because when you add reactions, you combine the reactants and products.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as:

Reversed reaction 1: CO2 + 2 H2O → CH4 + 2 O2.

Reversed a: CO2 → C + O2.

Reversed b (×2): 2 H2O → 2 H2 + O2.

So, when I add these three reactions together, the CO2 and H2O on the reactant side will be consumed.

Let me write it out:

Reversed reaction 1: CO2 + 2 H2O → CH4 + 2 O2.

Reversed a: CO2 → C + O2.

Reversed b (×2): 2 H2O → 2 H2 + O2.

So, adding these would mean:

CO2 + 2 H2O + CO2 + 2 H2O → CH4 + 2 O2 + C + O2 + 2 H2 + O2.

Wait, that's not correct because I'm adding all the left sides and right sides. Let me try a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I should write each step as an equation and sum them.

Let me write each reaction with their ΔH.

1. CO2 + 2 H2O → CH4 + 2 O2 ; ΔH = +212.80.

2. CO2 → C + O2 ; ΔH = +94.05.

3. 2 H2O → 2 H2 + O2 ; ΔH = 2*(+68.32) = +136.64.

Now, sum these three reactions.

Adding the left sides: CO2 + 2 H2O + CO2 + 2 H2O → ... Wait, no, each reaction is separate. Let me think again.

Wait, no. The first reaction is equation 1, which is CO2 + 2 H2O → products. The second equation is CO2 → C + O2. The third is 2 H2O → 2 H2 + O2.

Wait, to combine them, I should align the reactions so that the overall equation gives the desired result.

Alternatively, perhaps I can add the three reactions as they are, but that would lead to some cancellation.

Wait, perhaps it's better to line them up:

Reaction 1: CO2 + 2 H2O → CH4 + 2 O2 ; ΔH = +212.80.

Reaction 2: CO2 → C + O2 ; ΔH = +94.05.

Reaction 3: 2 H2O → 2 H2 + O2 ; ΔH = +136.64.

Now, adding all three reactions together.

The left sides: CO2 + 2 H2O + CO2 + 2 H2O → ... No, wait, each reaction is separate. So when you add them, you combine all reactants and products.

Wait, no, because each reaction is a separate equation. So, the sum would be the sum of all left sides → sum of all right sides, and the ΔH would be the sum of all ΔH's.

So, sum of the left sides:

CO2 (from reaction 1) + 2 H2O (reaction 1) + CO2 (reaction 2) + 2 H2O (reaction 3).

Wait, no. Let me rephrase. Reaction 1 left side is CO2 + 2 H2O. Reaction 2 left side is CO2. Reaction 3 left side is 2 H2O. So, adding all left sides gives CO2 + 2 H2O + CO2 + 2 H2O = 2 CO2 + 4 H2O.

Sum of the right sides: CH4 + 2 O2 (reaction 1) + C + O2 (reaction 2) + 2 H2 + O2 (reaction 3).

So, CH4 + 2 O2 + C + O2 + 2 H2 + O2.

Combine like terms: C + CH4 + 2 H2 + (2 O2 + O2 + O2) = C + CH4 + 2 H2 + 4 O2.

Wait, that doesn't seem to help. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake in how to combine the reactions.

Alternatively, perhaps I should subtract reaction 2 and 3 from reaction 1.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me think about the target equation.

I want to get C + 2 H2 → CH4.

Looking at the reactions, I can see that CH4 is produced in the reversed reaction 1. So perhaps I can write:

CH4 is formed from CO2 and H2O, but I need to get rid of CO2 and H2O by using their formation reactions.

So, the overall approach would be:

Target = Reversed reaction 1 - reaction a - 2*(reaction b).

Wait, that sounds promising.

Because in reversed reaction 1, I have CO2 and H2O as reactants producing CH4. But I need to get C and H2 as reactants. So, to eliminate CO2 and H2O, I subtract their formation reactions.

So, the ΔH for the target would be ΔH_reversed_1 - ΔH_a - 2*ΔH_b.

Wait, let's calculate that.

ΔH_reversed_1 is +212.80.

ΔH_a is the ΔH for reaction a: C + O2 → CO2, ΔH = -94.05. So, in the target, we have to subtract this, so it's -(-94.05) = +94.05.

Wait, no, wait. Because reaction a is C + O2 → CO2, ΔH = -94.05.

In the target equation, CO2 is a reactant in reversed reaction 1, so to get rid of it, I need
