Question:

The hormone which brings about metamorphosis of the cecropia moth is secreted by a gland in the thorax. However, no metamorphosis takes place if the head is cut off, even though the larva continues to live. Explain.

Options:

A: The gland in the thorax is the only gland involved, but it requires a signal from the head to start metamorphosis.
B: Only the gland in the head is necessary for metamorphosis.
C: The gland in the head secretes a different hormone necessary for the initiation of the metamorphosis process.
D: The gland in the thorax secretes the hormone, but the head must be present to activate it.
E: Metamorphosis is triggered by environmental factors, not by hormones secreted by glands.
F: Metamorphosis is controlled by a gland in the abdomen, not the thorax or the head.
G: The head contains an inhibitor that prevents the gland in the thorax from inducing metamorphosis.
H: Neither the gland in the head nor the gland in the thorax are necessary for metamorphosis.
I: Both the gland in the head and the gland in the thorax of the cecropia moth are necessary for the process of metamorphosis.
J: Only the gland in the thorax is necessary for metamorphosis.

Okay, so I've got this question about the metamorphosis of the cecropia moth, and I need to figure it out. Let's see... The question says that the hormone causing metamorphosis is secreted by a gland in the thorax. But if the head is cut off, metamorphosis doesn't happen, even though the larva is still alive.

Hmm. So the thorax has a gland that makes the hormone, right? But without the head, it doesn't work. So maybe the head is involved in some way. I remember that in insects, hormones like ecdysone are involved in molting and metamorphosis. Oh wait, ecdysone is produced by the prothoracic glands, which are in the thorax. But there's also the brain, which releases hormones that trigger the prothoracic glands to release theirs.

So the prothoracic glands (thorax) can't just secrete ecdysone on their own. They need a signal, probably from the head. The head must produce a hormone that tells the thorax gland to release the metamorphosis hormone. So in the question, when the head is cut off, that signal isn't sent. The thorax gland doesn't get the instruction to release the hormone, so no metamorphosis happens.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the thorax gland requires a signal from the head. That makes sense. Because without the head, even though the gland is present, it can't function.

Option C says the head's gland secretes a different hormone needed. That's also possible. Like, maybe the head produces a hormone that's necessary alongside the thorax's hormone. But in this case, the question states that the thorax's hormone is the one causing metamorphosis. So maybe the head's role is just to trigger its release, not to produce another hormone.

Option I says both glands are necessary, meaning both head and thorax. But the question says the thorax's gland is the one secreting the hormone. So perhaps the head just sends a signal without producing a hormone. Or maybe the head's gland does produce a hormone that's necessary. Wait, the brain (in the head) releases prothoracicotropic hormone, which stimulates the prothoracic glands (thorax) to release ecdysone. So both the head and the thorax are involved.

So looking back at the options:

Option I says both are necessary. That would make sense because the head's hormone is needed to activate the thorax's gland.

So putting it together, the correct answer would be I. Because both glands are necessary: the head's to produce the signal, and the thorax's to produce the hormone.

The metamorphosis of the cecropia moth is regulated by a complex interplay of hormones. The prothoracic glands located in the thorax secrete the hormone ecdysone, which directly induces metamorphosis. However, these glands do not function autonomously; they require a signal from the head. Specifically, the brain in the head releases prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), which stimulates the prothoracic glands to produce and release ecdysone. If the head is removed, this critical signal is absent, and the prothoracic glands cannot initiate hormone secretion, preventing metamorphosis even though the larva remains alive.

Among the options provided:

- **Option I** correctly identifies that both the head and the thorax glands are necessary for metamorphosis. The head produces PTTH, which is essential for activating the thorax glands to release ecdysone.

Thus, the correct answer is:

I: Both the gland in the head and the gland in the thorax of the cecropia moth are necessary for the process of metamorphosis.

Answer: I
