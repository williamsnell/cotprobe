Okay, so I've got this integral to evaluate, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of gamma functions and integrals. Let me see what I can do here.

The integral is from 0 to 0.4 of [Γ(7)/(Γ(4)Γ(3))] * y^3 * (1-y)^2 dy. Hmm, so first off, I remember that the gamma function is related to factorials for positive integers. Γ(n) = (n-1)! So Γ(7) would be 6! which is 720. Γ(4) is 3! = 6, and Γ(3) is 2! = 2. So the coefficient would be 720/(6*2) = 720/12 = 60. So the integral simplifies to 60 times the integral from 0 to 0.4 of y^3 (1-y)^2 dy.

Wait, but wait a second, I think I remember that the integral of y^(a-1) (1-y)^(b-1) dy from 0 to 1 is the Beta function B(a,b), which is Γ(a)Γ(b)/Γ(a+b). But our integral goes from 0 to 0.4 instead of 1, so it's not the complete Beta function. Oh, that's a bit more complicated.

So the integral part is ∫ y^3 (1-y)^2 dy from 0 to 0.4. Let me think, maybe I can expand the terms to integrate. Let's see, (1-y)^2 is 1 - 2y + y^2. So when I multiply by y^3, I get y^3 - 2y^4 + y^5. So the integral becomes ∫ (y^3 - 2y^4 + y^5) dy from 0 to 0.4.

Let me integrate term by term. The integral of y^3 is (y^4)/4, of y^4 is (y^5)/5, and y^5 is (y^6)/6. So putting it all together, the integral is [ (y^4/4) - 2*(y^5/5) + y^6/6 ] evaluated from 0 to 0.4.

Calculating each term at 0.4:

First term: (0.4)^4 /4 = (0.0256)/4 = 0.0064.

Second term: 2*(0.4)^5 /5. (0.4)^5 is 0.01024, so 2*0.01024=0.02048. Divided by 5 is 0.004096. But since it's minus, it's -0.004096.

Third term: (0.4)^6 /6. (0.4)^6 is 0.004096, divided by 6 is approximately 0.000682666...

Adding them up: 0.0064 - 0.004096 is 0.002304, plus 0.000682666 is approximately 0.002986666...

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because I might have messed up the exponents.

Wait, (0.4)^4 is 0.0256, correct. Divided by 4 is 0.0064. Right.

(0.4)^5 is 0.4 * 0.0256 = 0.01024. Multiply by 2 is 0.02048. Divided by 5: 0.02048/5 = 0.004096. So that term is -0.004096.

(0.4)^6 is 0.01024 * 0.4 = 0.004096. Divided by 6: approximately 0.0006826667.

So adding: 0.0064 - 0.004096 = 0.002304. Plus 0.0006826667: total is 0.0029866667.

So the integral is approximately 0.0029866667. Now multiply by the coefficient 60. So 60 * 0.0029866667 is about 0.1792.

Wait, let me compute that: 0.0029866667 * 60. 0.0029866667 * 60 = 0.1792 exactly? Let me check:

0.0029866667 is approximately 0.0029866667. Multiply by 60: 60 * 0.0029866667 = 0.1792.

So the value of the integral is 0.1792. Looking at the options, option F is 0.1792. So the answer should be F.

Alternatively, another approach: using the incomplete Beta function. The integral ∫0^a y^{c-1}(1-y)^{d-1} dy is the regularized Beta function I_a(c,d). So in this case, a=0.4, c=4, d=3. So the integral is I_{0.4}(4,3). But I don't remember the exact value, so maybe computing it numerically as I did before is better.

Alternatively, perhaps using substitution or looking for a Beta function identity, but since the upper limit isn't 1, it's easier to compute term by term as I did.

The integral to evaluate is:

$$
\int_0^{0.4} \frac{\Gamma(7)}{\Gamma(4) \Gamma(3)} y^3(1-y)^2 dy
$$

First, the coefficient is simplified using the properties of the gamma function, where $\Gamma(n) = (n-1)!$ for positive integers. Thus:

$$
\frac{\Gamma(7)}{\Gamma(4) \Gamma(3)} = \frac{6!}{3! \cdot 2!} = \frac{720}{6 \cdot 2} = 60
$$

This reduces the integral to:

$$
60 \int_0^{0.4} y^3 (1-y)^2 dy
$$

Expanding $(1-y)^2$ gives $1 - 2y + y^2$. Multiplying through by $y^3$, the integrand becomes:

$$
y^3 - 2y^4 + y^5
$$

The integral is then:

$$
\int_0^{0.4} (y^3 - 2y^4 + y^5) dy
$$

Integrating term by term:

1. $\int y^3 dy = \frac{y^4}{4}$
2. $\int y^4 dy = \frac{y^5}{5}$
3. $\int y^5 dy = \frac{y^6}{6}$

Thus, the integral becomes:

$$
\left[ \frac{y^4}{4} - \frac{2y^5}{5} + \frac{y^6}{6} \right]_0^{0.4}
$$

Evaluating each term at $y = 0.4$:

1. $\frac{(0.4)^4}{4} = \frac{0.0256}{4} = 0.0064$
2. $\frac{2(0.4)^5}{5} = \frac{2 \cdot 0.01024}{5} = 0.004096$
3. $\frac{(0.4)^6}{6} = \frac{0.004096}{6} \approx 0.0006826667$

Adding these terms:

$$
0.0064 - 0.004096 + 0.0006826667 \approx 0.0029866667
$$

Multiplying by the coefficient $60$:

$$
60 \cdot 0.0029866667 \approx 0.1792
$$

Thus, the value of the integral is approximately $0.1792$, which corresponds to option **F**.
