Okay, so I've got this question about factor analysis and its role in describing intelligence. I'm a bit rusty on my psychology, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that factor analysis is a statistical method used to identify patterns or underlying factors. In the context of intelligence, I think it's used to find commonalities among different test scores. Like, if various cognitive tests correlate with each other, factor analysis can help find the underlying factors that explain those correlations.

Wait, Charles Spearman comes to mind. He proposed the idea of the g factor, general intelligence, right? He used factor analysis to show that a single general factor underlies all cognitive tasks. So factor analysis was key in identifying that. But then there are others like L.L. Thurstone who proposed multiple factors, right? He talked about primary mental abilities, so factor analysis helped him identify those different categories.

Looking at the options:

Option G says factor analysis is used to identify underlying intellectual traits and establish descriptive categories. That sounds right because it's about finding those underlying factors and grouping them into categories, like Spearman's g or Thurstone's primary abilities.

Option H says it's used to establish the exact number of intelligence types. Hmm, but I don't think factor analysis gives an exact number. It's more about identifying factors based on the data, so the number can vary depending on the analysis and theory.

Option D is about genetic basis, which I don't think is directly related. Factor analysis is more about structure, not causes like genetics.

Option E measures IQ directly? No, IQ tests are separate. Factor analysis is statistical, not a measurement tool.

Option I is about predicting academic performance. That might be a use of IQ scores, but not the role of factor analysis itself.

So the correct answer should be G. It helps identify underlying traits and establish categories, which is exactly what it's used for in intelligence theories.

Factor analysis plays a crucial role in the study of intelligence by identifying underlying intellectual traits and establishing descriptive categories. It is a statistical method that helps uncover common factors among various cognitive tests, such as Charles Spearman's concept of the "g factor" (general intelligence) and L.L. Thurstone's "primary mental abilities." These categories provide a structured way to understand the components of intelligence. While factor analysis does not determine the exact number of intelligence types or predict academic performance, it is instrumental in organizing and explaining the underlying structure of cognitive abilities.

Answer: G
