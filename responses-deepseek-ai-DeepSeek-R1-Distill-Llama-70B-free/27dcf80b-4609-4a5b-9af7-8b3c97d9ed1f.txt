Question:

Susan reads a book at a rate of 1 page every 3 minutes. If her reading rate remains the same, which method could be used to determine the number of minutes for her to read 18 pages?

Options:

A: add 18 and 3
B: subtract 18 from 3, then multiply by 3
C: divide 18 by 3
D: add 18 and 3, then divide by 3
E: subtract 3 from 18
F: subtract 18 from 3
G: add 3 to 18
H: multiply 3 by 18
I: divide 3 by 18

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this math problem here. Let's read it again.

Susan reads a book at a rate of 1 page every 3 minutes. They want to know how many minutes it would take her to read 18 pages, using the same reading rate. And the options are multiple-choice from A to I.

Hmm, let's break this down. So Susan's reading rate is 1 page per 3 minutes. That means for each page she reads, it takes her 3 minutes. So if she's reading 18 pages, how long would that take in total?

Wait, so if one page is 3 minutes, then for 18 pages, I think you multiply the number of pages by the time per page. So 18 pages times 3 minutes each. That would give the total time, right?

Let me think of it another way. If 1 page = 3 minutes, then 2 pages would be 6 minutes, 3 pages 9 minutes, and so on. So each page adds 3 minutes. So for 18 pages, it's 18 times 3, which is 54 minutes. But wait, the question is asking which method to use, not the actual calculation.

Looking at the options, option H is multiply 3 by 18. Oh, that's exactly what I just thought. Because the rate is 3 minutes per page, so 3 * 18 gives total minutes.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not confusing this with anything else. Another way to think about it is, her rate is 1/3 pages per minute. Wait, no, that's pages per minute. So time per page is 3 minutes. So time equals number of pages multiplied by time per page. So 18 *3 is 54. So the method is multiply 3 by 18, which is option H.

Wait, but let me check the other options to make sure.

Option A: add 18 and 3. That would be 21. No, that's not right.

Option B: subtract 18 from 3, then multiply by 3. That would be negative, which doesn't make sense. So no.

Option C: divide 18 by 3. That's 6. But that would give pages per minute, which isn't what we're looking for. Wait, if her rate is 1 page every 3 minutes, that's 1/3 pages per minute. So 18 pages would take 18 / (1/3) = 54 minutes. Oh wait, that's another way. So 18 divided by (1/3) is 54. But none of the options directly say that. Wait, option C is divide 18 by 3, which gives 6, but that's not the same as dividing by 1/3.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. The straightforward way is pages multiplied by time per page. So 18 *3 =54. So the method is multiply 3 by 18, which is option H.

So the correct answer should be H.

To determine the number of minutes Susan takes to read 18 pages at a rate of 1 page every 3 minutes, we multiply the number of pages by the time per page. This means calculating \( 18 \times 3 = 54 \) minutes. Among the options provided, the correct method is to multiply 3 by 18.

The answer is H.
