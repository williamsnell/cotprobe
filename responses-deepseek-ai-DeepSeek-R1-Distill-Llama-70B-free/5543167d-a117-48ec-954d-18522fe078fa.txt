Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about the vibrational frequency of the Cl₂ molecule. Hmm, I remember from my chemistry classes that the vibrational frequency is related to the force constant and the reduced mass of the molecule. Let me think about the formula.

Oh right, the formula for the fundamental vibrational frequency is given by ν = (1/(2πc)) * sqrt(k/μ), where ν is the wavenumber, k is the force constant, μ is the reduced mass, and c is the speed of light. Wait, no, wait. Let me get the units right. Oh, right, sometimes it's expressed using ν in cm⁻¹, which is wavenumbers.

Wait, another version I remember is ν (in Hz) equals (1/(2π)) times sqrt(k/μ). But since the options are in cm⁻¹, I think I need to convert Hz to wavenumbers. Oh right, because 1 Hz is 1 cycle per second, but in spectroscopy, we often use wavenumbers which is cm⁻¹, calculated as ν (Hz) divided by the speed of light in cm/s.

So putting it all together, the formula in terms of wavenumbers would be ν̃ (cm⁻¹) = (1/(2πc)) * sqrt(k/μ). Wait, maybe I should be careful with the exact expression. Alternatively, I think the formula can be written as ν̃ = (1/(2π)) * sqrt(k/μ) / c. Or perhaps more accurately, ν̃ = (1/(2πc)) * sqrt(k/μ). Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing up the steps.

Wait, let's start over. The vibrational frequency in terms of angular frequency ω is given by ω = sqrt(k/μ). And angular frequency ω is 2π times the frequency ν, so ν = ω/(2π) = (1/(2π)) sqrt(k/μ). But this ν is in Hz. To get wavenumbers (cm⁻¹), we divide by the speed of light c in cm/s, because wavenumber is frequency divided by c (since wavelength λ = c/ν → 1/λ = ν/c → wavenumber = ν/c).

So ν̃ = ν / c = (1/(2π)) sqrt(k/μ) / c. So the formula becomes ν̃ = (1/(2πc)) * sqrt(k/μ). That makes sense.

Now, the values we have are the force constant k = 319 N/m. We need the reduced mass μ. Since the molecule is Cl₂, each Cl atom is ^35Cl, so the mass of each Cl atom is approximately 35 atomic mass units. 

Wait, atomic mass units need to be converted to kilograms. One u is about 1.66053906660e-27 kg. So each Cl atom is 35 u, so 35 * 1.6605e-27 kg. 

The reduced mass μ for a diatomic molecule A-B is (m_A * m_B)/(m_A + m_B). Since it's Cl₂, both masses are the same, so μ = (m * m)/(2m) ) = m/2. So for each Cl atom, mass m = 35 u. So μ = (35 u)/2.

Wait, wait. Let me compute that correctly. Each Cl atom has a molar mass of about 35 g/mol. But wait, I'm getting confused between molar mass and actual mass. Let me think. The molar mass M is 35 g/mol, which is 0.035 kg/mol. But to get the mass of one molecule, I need to use Avogadro's number.

Alternatively, since I know that 1 u = 1.6605e-27 kg, and the mass of one Cl atom is 35 u, so m = 35 * 1.6605e-27 kg. So for Cl₂, each atom is m = 35 * 1.6605e-27 kg. So the reduced mass μ is (m * m)/(m + m) )= m²/(2m) ) = m/2. So μ = (35 * 1.6605e-27 kg)/2.

Calculating that, μ = (35 * 1.6605e-27) / 2 = (58.1175e-27 kg) / 2 = 29.05875e-27 kg. So μ is approximately 2.905875e-26 kg.

Wait, let me compute that again. 35 * 1.6605e-27 = let's compute 35 * 1.6605 first. 35 * 1.66 is about 58.1, so 35 * 1.6605e-27 = 58.1175e-27 kg. Divided by 2 gives 29.05875e-27 kg, which is 2.905875e-26 kg. So μ ≈ 2.9059e-26 kg.

Now, putting all the values into the formula. Let's compute sqrt(k/μ). k is 319 N/m.

So k/μ = 319 / 2.9059e-26. Let me compute that. 319 divided by 2.9059e-26 equals approximately 319 / 2.9059e-26.

Wait, 319 / 2.9059 is approximately: let's compute 319 / 2.9059. 2.9059 * 100 is 290.59. 319 is about 110 times 2.9059 (since 2.9059 * 100 is 290.59, 319 is 319-290.59=28.41 more, so 100 + (28.41/2.9059) ≈ 100 + ~9.78 ≈ 109.78). So 319/2.9059 ≈ 109.78. But wait, 2.9059e-26 is 2.9059 *1e-26. So 319/(2.9059e-26) = (319/2.9059) * 1e26 ≈ 109.78 * 1e26 = 1.0978e28 (unit is 1/s², since N/m is kg/s², and dividing by kg gives 1/s²).

Now, the square root of that is sqrt(1.0978e28) = sqrt(1.0978) * 1e14. Sqrt(1.0978) is approximately 1.0478. So sqrt(k/μ) ≈ 1.0478e14 s⁻¹.

Now, multiply by 1/(2πc) to get ν̃ in cm⁻¹. c is the speed of light, which is approximately 3e8 m/s. But wait, since we're working in cm, we should convert c to cm/s. 1 m = 100 cm, so c = 3e8 m/s = 3e10 cm/s.

So 1/(2πc) = 1/(2 * π * 3e10 cm/s) ≈ 1/(1.884e11) cm⁻¹ s. Wait, let me compute that properly. 2π is approximately 6.2832. So 2πc = 6.2832 * 3e10 cm/s = 1.88496e11 cm/s.

So 1/(2πc) = 1 / (1.88496e11 cm/s) ≈ 5.305e-12 s/cm.

Now, ν̃ = (1/(2πc)) * sqrt(k/μ) = (5.305e-12 s/cm) * (1.0478e14 s⁻¹).

Multiply these together: 5.305e-12 * 1.0478e14 = let's calculate the exponent first: 1e-12 * 1e14 = 1e2. So 5.305 * 1.0478 = approximately 5.305 * 1.05 is about 5.568, but more accurately, 5.305 * 1.0478.

Let me compute 5 * 1.0478 = 5.239, 0.305 * 1.0478 ≈ 0.3196. So total is 5.239 + 0.3196 ≈ 5.5586. So 5.5586 * 1e2 = 555.86 cm⁻¹.

Looking at the options, option F is 556 cm⁻¹, which is very close to this value. So the answer should be F.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have made an error in exponents or something.

Let me recompute sqrt(k/μ). k is 319, μ is 2.9059e-26 kg. So 319 / 2.9059e-26 = 319 / 2.9059 = approximately 109.78, as before. So 109.78e26, which is 1.0978e28. Square root is sqrt(1.0978e28) = sqrt(1.0978) * 1e14. sqrt(1.0978) is about 1.0478, so 1.0478e14 s⁻¹.

Then, 1/(2πc) with c=3e10 cm/s. So 1/(2π*3e10) = 1/(6.2832e10) ≈ 1.5915e-11 s/cm. Wait, no, wait: 2πc is 6.2832 * 3e10 = 1.88496e11 cm/s. So 1/(1.88496e11) is about 5.305e-12 s/cm.

Multiply that by 1.0478e14 s⁻¹: 5.305e-12 * 1.0478e14 = (5.305 * 1.0478) * (1e-12 * 1e14) = 5.558 * 1e2 = 555.8 cm⁻¹, so approximately 556 cm⁻¹, which is option F.

To calculate the fundamental vibrational frequency of the Cl₂ molecule, we use the formula for wavenumber:

\[
\tilde{\nu} = \frac{1}{2\pi c} \sqrt{\frac{k}{\mu}}
\]

where:
- \( k = 319 \, \mathrm{N/m} \) (force constant),
- \( \mu \) is the reduced mass of the molecule,
- \( c = 3 \times 10^{10} \, \mathrm{cm/s} \) (speed of light).

### Step 1: Calculate the reduced mass (\( \mu \))
For a diatomic molecule like Cl₂, the reduced mass is given by:

\[
\mu = \frac{m}{2}
\]

where \( m \) is the mass of one Cl atom. The mass of one Cl atom is:

\[
m = 35 \, \mathrm{u} \times 1.6605 \times 10^{-27} \, \mathrm{kg/u} = 5.81175 \times 10^{-26} \, \mathrm{kg}
\]

Thus, the reduced mass is:

\[
\mu = \frac{5.81175 \times 10^{-26}}{2} = 2.905875 \times 10^{-26} \, \mathrm{kg}
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \sqrt{k / \mu} \)
Substitute \( k = 319 \, \mathrm{N/m} \) and \( \mu = 2.905875 \times 10^{-26} \, \mathrm{kg} \):

\[
\frac{k}{\mu} = \frac{319}{2.905875 \times 10^{-26}} = 1.0978 \times 10^{28} \, \mathrm{s^{-2}}
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{k}{\mu}} = \sqrt{1.0978 \times 10^{28}} = 1.0478 \times 10^{14} \, \mathrm{s^{-1}}
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \tilde{\nu} \)
Substitute \( \sqrt{k / \mu} = 1.0478 \times 10^{14} \, \mathrm{s^{-1}} \) and \( c = 3 \times 10^{10} \, \mathrm{cm/s} \):

\[
\tilde{\nu} = \frac{1}{2\pi c} \sqrt{\frac{k}{\mu}} = \frac{1}{2\pi (3 \times 10^{10})} \times 1.0478 \times 10^{14}
\]

First, calculate \( 2\pi c \):

\[
2\pi c = 6.2832 \times 3 \times 10^{10} = 1.88496 \times 10^{11} \, \mathrm{cm/s}
\]

Now, divide:

\[
\frac{1}{2\pi c} = \frac{1}{1.88496 \times 10^{11}} = 5.305 \times 10^{-12} \, \mathrm{s/cm}
\]

Finally, multiply:

\[
\tilde{\nu} = 5.305 \times 10^{-12} \times 1.0478 \times 10^{14} = 555.86 \, \mathrm{cm^{-1}}
\]

### Final Answer
The calculated wavenumber is approximately \( 556 \, \mathrm{cm^{-1}} \), which corresponds to option **F**.
