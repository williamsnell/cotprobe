Question:

A cylinder with a movable piston contains a gas at pressure P = 1 × 10^5 Pa, volume V = 20 cm^3, and temperature T = 273 K. The piston is moved downward in a slow steady fashion allowing heat to escape the gas and the temperature to remain constant. If the final volume of the gas is 5 cm^3, what will be the resulting pressure?

Options:

A: 6 × 10^5 Pa
B: 9 × 10^5 Pa
C: 3 × 10^5 Pa
D: 5 × 10^5 Pa
E: 0.25 × 10^5 Pa
F: 1 × 10^5 Pa
G: 8 × 10^5 Pa
H: 4 × 10^5 Pa
I: 7 × 10^5 Pa
J: 2 × 10^5 Pa

Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about a gas in a cylinder with a movable piston. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through. The question is about pressure, volume, and temperature, so I remember that the ideal gas law is probably involved here. 

Right, the ideal gas law is PV = nRT. But wait, the problem says that the temperature remains constant. Oh, right! So if temperature doesn't change, it's probably a situation where Charles's Law or Boyle's Law applies. Because those are the ones that deal with constant temperature and pressure or volume changes.

Wait, Boyle's Law is when the temperature is constant, and it's about pressure and volume. Boyle's Law states that P1 * V1 = P2 * V2. Exactly, because if T is constant, n and R are also constants, so PV is a constant. So that's the way to go here.

Let me look at the numbers. The initial pressure P1 is 1e5 Pa. The initial volume V1 is 20 cm³, and the final volume V2 is 5 cm³. They want the final pressure P2.

So substituting into Boyle's Law: P1 * V1 = P2 * V2. Solving for P2 gives P2 = (P1 * V1) / V2.

Plugging in the numbers: P2 = (1e5 Pa * 20 cm³) / 5 cm³. Let's compute that. 20 divided by 5 is 4, so 1e5 multiplied by 4 is 4e5 Pa.

Wait, but let me double-check the units. The volume is in cm³, but since both volumes are in the same unit, the ratio is unitless, so the pressure comes out in the same unit as P1, which is Pascals. So that's correct.

Looking at the options, option H is 4 × 10^5 Pa. So that should be the correct answer. Let me make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. 20 times 1e5 is 2e6, divided by 5 is 0.4e6, which is 4e5. Yep, that's right.

Wait, but the process was done slowly and heat escaped, so it's an isothermal process. Yes, that aligns with using Boyle's Law because it's a constant temperature process. So everything checks out.

To solve the problem, we use Boyle's Law, which states that for a gas at constant temperature, the product of pressure and volume remains constant:  

\[
P_1 V_1 = P_2 V_2
\]

Here, the initial pressure \( P_1 = 1 \times 10^5 \, \text{Pa} \), the initial volume \( V_1 = 20 \, \text{cm}^3 \), and the final volume \( V_2 = 5 \, \text{cm}^3 \). Solving for the final pressure \( P_2 \):

\[
P_2 = \frac{P_1 V_1}{V_2}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
P_2 = \frac{(1 \times 10^5 \, \text{Pa}) (20 \, \text{cm}^3)}{5 \, \text{cm}^3} = 4 \times 10^5 \, \text{Pa}
\]

Thus, the resulting pressure is \( 4 \times 10^5 \, \text{Pa} \), which corresponds to option H.
