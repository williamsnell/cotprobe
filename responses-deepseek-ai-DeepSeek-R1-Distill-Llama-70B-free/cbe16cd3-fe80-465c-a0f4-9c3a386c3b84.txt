Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this economics problem. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question says that the Real GDP is $200 billion and the price index is 200. I need to find the Nominal GDP from the options given. Hmm, I remember that Real GDP and Nominal GDP are related through the price index or the GDP deflator. 

Wait, I think the formula connects them. Oh right, the formula is Nominal GDP = Real GDP multiplied by the GDP deflator. But wait, sometimes the deflator is expressed as a number, like a percentage. Oh right, the GDP deflator is usually expressed as a decimal, but in this case, the price index is given as 200. So does that mean the deflator is 200 or 2.00? Because sometimes indexes are based on a base year of 100.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think. The GDP deflator is calculated as (Nominal GDP / Real GDP) * 100. So if the price index is 200, that would imply that the deflator is 200. Or is the price index the same as the deflator? Maybe I should clarify that.

So, if the price index is 200, does that mean the deflator is also 200? Let me think. The formula I remember is:

Nominal GDP = Real GDP × (GDP Deflator / 100)

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Because the GDP deflator is typically a percentage relative to a base year. So if the base year is 100, then in a year where the deflator is 200, prices have doubled. So, the formula should be Nominal GDP = Real GDP × (Deflator). But wait, no, the deflator is usually (Nominal/Real)*100, so if the deflator is 200, that would mean Nominal = Real × 2.

Wait, because if Deflator = (Nominal / Real) * 100, then rearranging, Nominal = (Deflator / 100) * Real.

So, for example, if Real GDP is $100 billion and the deflator is 200, then Nominal GDP is (200 / 100) * 100 = 200 billion.

Wait, but in this problem, Real GDP is 200 billion and the price index (which I'm assuming is the same as the deflator) is 200. So applying the formula:

Nominal GDP = Real GDP × (Deflator / 100)

So that's 200 billion × (200 / 100) = 200 × 2 = 400 billion.

Wait, but wait another thought. Sometimes the price index is presented as a number without the percentage. So if the price index is 200, that could mean 200%, which is 2 in decimal. So, using that, Nominal GDP would be Real GDP multiplied by 2, which is 400 billion. So that would make the answer I: $400 billion.

Let me check the options. The options are:

A: $300 billion
B: $800 billion
C: $4 billion
D: $600 billion
E: $200 billion
F: $2 billion
G: $50 billion
H: $100 billion
I: $400 billion
J: $1 billion

So option I is 400 billion, which matches my calculation. Therefore, the correct answer should be I.

To determine Nominal GDP, we use the relationship between Real GDP, Nominal GDP, and the GDP deflator (price index). The formula is:

\[
\text{Nominal GDP} = \text{Real GDP} \times \left(\frac{\text{GDP Deflator}}{100}\right)
\]

Given:
- Real GDP = $200 billion
- Price Index (GDP Deflator) = 200

Substituting the values into the formula:

\[
\text{Nominal GDP} = 200 \times \left(\frac{200}{100}\right) = 200 \times 2 = 400 \text{ billion}
\]

Thus, the Nominal GDP is $400 billion.

The correct answer is **I: $400 billion**.
