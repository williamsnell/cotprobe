Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about longitudinal studies of children with specific reading disabilities. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking what these studies show. The options are A through J. I remember that specific reading disabilities are often referred to as dyslexia. So, I should focus on what I know about dyslexia and longitudinal studies.

Option A says these children usually have high social skills. Wait, I'm not sure. I think sometimes kids with reading difficulties might struggle socially because they might have lower self-esteem or feel different, but I'm not certain if that's a given. Maybe not the best option.

Option B: above-average IQ. Oh, right! Dyslexia doesn't affect intelligence. In fact, many people with dyslexia have average or above-average IQs. They might struggle with reading, but their cognitive abilities are intact. So B could be a contender.

Option C: high vocabulary. Wait, no, I think the opposite. If you have a reading disability, you might not have as much exposure to written vocabulary, so their vocabulary might be lower. Or maybe their spoken vocabulary is okay because that's different from reading. Not sure, I'll keep this in mind.

Option D: subtle hearing disorders. I don't recall hearing impairments being a primary issue in specific reading disabilities. Maybe that's more related to speech or language impairments. So probably not D.

Option E: excel in artistic activities. I've heard that some dyslexics are good at art, music, or other creative fields. That might be a possibility, but I don't know if studies show that as a usual outcome. It might be more anecdotal.

Option F: excel in sports. I don't think there's a direct link. Sports require different skills, so maybe some do, but it's not a general finding. So probably not F.

Option G: impairments improve significantly with age. I remember reading that while some reading skills can improve, especially with intervention, many individuals still face challenges into adulthood. So maybe G isn't correct.

Option H: low vocabulary level. This could be true if their reading is impaired, they might have limited exposure to new words through reading, affecting their vocabulary. So H seems plausible.

Option I: exceptional mathematical skills. I'm not sure. Some might have strengths in math, others might not. I don't think it's a usual finding. So probably not I.

Option J: reading skills don't reach normal levels in adulthood. Yes, I think this is correct. Longitudinal studies suggest that while some progress is made, many still don't catch up entirely. Their reading might remain below average even as adults.

Wait, let me go back. The question is about what the studies show. So if J says that their reading doesn't reach normal as adults, that aligns with what I was thinking earlier about G being incorrect because improvement isn't always significant.

So looking at the options again. The question is about what is usually shown. So for B, high IQ is correct. But does the question say anything about IQ?

Wait, I think many with dyslexia have average to above-average IQ, which contradicts the idea that it's an intellectual disability. So B could be a correct option.

But the question is about what the studies show. Let me think: Do longitudinal studies show that these children usually have above-average IQs? Or is that a common misconception?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is J, because it's more about the outcome of the reading disability itself.

Wait, another angle. The options are about what the studies show. So, I think that specific reading disabilities (dyslexia) are not linked to low IQ. So children with reading disabilities can have average or above-average IQ. So B might be correct, but let me check the other options.

Wait, the question is about which option is correct. So, which of these is supported by research?

Option J: reading skills don't reach normal levels as adults. I think that's accurate because dyslexia is a lifelong condition, though coping strategies can help. So J would be correct.

But wait, let's consider each option again.

Option B: above-average IQ. I'm pretty sure that's correct. Many dyslexic individuals have normal or above-average IQ. So B could be a correct answer.

Wait, but the question is about what longitudinal studies show. So, do they find that these children usually have above-average IQ?

I think the answer is B. Or is it J?

Wait, another point: the question is about "specific reading disabilities," which implies that their reading is poor but other areas are average or better. So their IQ is usually average or above. So B might be correct.

But then, what about option H and C? Option C says high vocabulary, which I think is unlikely because reading is impaired, so vocabulary might be lower. So H says low vocabulary, which makes more sense.

Wait, but some researchers argue that in dyslexia, phonological awareness is the issue, not necessarily vocabulary. So maybe their spoken vocabulary is okay, but their reading vocabulary is lower. So in terms of reading, their vocabulary level is low, but in spoken language, it might not be. So perhaps H is correct.

But the question is about the reading impairments. So H says accompanied by low vocabulary. So maybe that's correct.

Alternatively, option J says that reading skills don't reach normal levels. I think that's a more direct outcome of longitudinal studies.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to approach this systematically.

The question is: Longitudinal studies of children with specific reading disabilities show that...

Which of the options is correct?

Option B: usually have above-average IQ. True, as dyslexia isn't linked to low IQ.

Option J: reading skills don't reach normal in adulthood. Also true, as it's a persistent condition.

So which of these is an established finding from longitudinal studies?

I think both B and J could be correct, but looking at the options, only one can be chosen.

Wait, but the question is about what the studies show. So perhaps the correct answer is J, because it's more about the outcome of the reading disability itself.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B, because it's an important characteristic of the population.

Wait, the options are about what the studies show. So, what do longitudinal studies show? Let me think about the classic studies.

I recall that the Connecticut Longitudinal Study looked at cognitive and achievement variables. They found that children with reading disabilities (dyslexia) often have average or above-average intelligence but struggle with reading and related skills.

So B would be correct.

But then, option J says that their reading doesn't reach normal levels as adults. That's also correct, but is that what the question is pointing towards?

Hmm, the question is asking which option is correct based on the studies, so perhaps both B and J are correct statements, but only one is among the options.

Wait, looking back, the options are A-J, and each is a separate option. So, I need to pick the correct one.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is J. Because the question is about what the longitudinal studies show regarding the outcome of their reading disability.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B, as it's a characteristic of the children.

Wait, another thought: specific reading disability is defined by a discrepancy between reading ability and IQ. So, yes, these children would have higher IQs than their reading levels would suggest.

So in that case, option B would be correct.

But I also remember that longitudinal studies show that reading difficulties tend to persist into adulthood, which would make J correct.

So now I'm torn between B and J.

Wait, the question is phrased as "show that" â€” which is more likely to be a finding from longitudinal studies. So, which is a conclusion from such studies.

I think that both B and J are correct statements, but let me see which one is an outcome observed in the studies.

Wait, for example, the study by Franceschini et al. (2012) found that reading disabilities can persist into adulthood. So J would be correct.

On the other hand, the fact that these children have above-average IQ is a characteristic, but perhaps it's not the main finding of the longitudinal studies, which are more about the progression and outcomes.

So perhaps the correct answer is J.

Wait, but the question is about what the studies show. So the fact that their reading doesn't reach normal levels in adulthood is a finding.

Alternatively, the fact that they have above-average IQ is a characteristic, but not necessarily a finding from the longitudinal aspect.

Wait, the question is about longitudinal studies, so they're looking at changes over time. So J is about the outcome over time, which is a finding of the longitudinal studies.

So I think J is the correct answer.

Wait, but another thought: option G says that the reading impairments improve significantly with age. Is that true? I thought that while some improvement occurs, especially with intervention, many still have difficulties. So G would be incorrect, and J correct.

So I'm leaning towards J being the correct answer.

But let me also consider the other options again.

Option H: reading impairments accompanied by low vocabulary. If reading is impaired, they might have lower reading vocabulary, but perhaps their spoken vocabulary is normal. So H could be correct if it's referring to reading vocabulary.

But the option just says "low vocabulary level," which is ambiguous. It might not specify reading vs speaking. So if the question is about reading vocabulary, H could be correct, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, I think that in dyslexia, the primary issue is with phonological decoding, which affects reading accuracy and fluency, but vocabulary knowledge (especially receptive) might be average, especially if they have good verbal comprehension. So I'm not sure about H.

So perhaps the correct answer is J.

Longitudinal studies of children with specific reading disabilities, often referred to as dyslexia, provide insights into the characteristics and outcomes of these children. The question asks which statement is supported by such studies. Here's an analysis of the options:

- **Option A**: These children usually have a high level of social skills. This is unlikely, as children with reading disabilities may face challenges with self-esteem or social interactions due to their difficulties.

- **Option B**: These children usually have above-average IQ levels. This is correct, as dyslexia is not related to low intelligence. Many individuals with dyslexia have average or above-average IQs.

- **Option C**: The reading impairments are usually accompanied by a high vocabulary level. This is unlikely, as reading difficulties can limit exposure to written vocabulary, potentially leading to lower vocabulary levels.

- **Option D**: These children usually have subtle hearing disorders. This is incorrect, as hearing impairments are not a primary characteristic of specific reading disabilities.

- **Option E**: These children usually excel in artistic activities. While some dyslexic individuals may excel in creative fields, this is anecdotal and not a consistent finding of longitudinal studies.

- **Option F**: These children usually excel in sports. There is no direct link between dyslexia and athletic ability, so this is not a general finding.

- **Option G**: The reading impairments usually improve significantly with age. This is incorrect, as while some improvement may occur with intervention, many individuals continue to face reading challenges into adulthood.

- **Option H**: The reading impairments are usually accompanied by a low vocabulary level. This could be true for reading vocabulary, as reading difficulties limit exposure to new words. However, spoken vocabulary may remain average.

- **Option I**: These children usually have exceptional mathematical skills. This is not a consistent finding, as mathematical abilities vary widely among individuals with dyslexia.

- **Option J**: Reading skills usually do not reach normal levels as these children reach adulthood. This is correct, as longitudinal studies show that dyslexia is a persistent condition, and reading skills often remain below average even in adulthood.

While both **B** and **J** are accurate statements, the question specifically asks about findings from longitudinal studies. The persistence of reading difficulties into adulthood, as stated in **J**, is a key outcome observed in such studies. Therefore, the correct answer is:

J
