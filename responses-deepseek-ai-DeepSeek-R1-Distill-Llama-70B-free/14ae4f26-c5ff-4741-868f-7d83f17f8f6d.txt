Question:

One morning, an employee arrived at work and found his boss passed out on the floor of his office. The employee determined that his boss was not breathing, immediately rendered CPR to his boss, and succeeded in reviving him. The employee then called the paramedics, who took the boss to the hospital. Two week later, the boss returned to work. Grateful for the employee's quick action in saving his life, the boss said to the employee, "You'll have ajob with me for life. "Which of the following best characterizes the legal relationship between the boss and the employee on that date?

Options:

A: Since the employee gratuitously rendered assistance to the boss, there was insufficient consideration to support the boss's subsequent promise to provide the employee with lifetime employment.
B: The boss had a duty to pay the employee reasonable compensation for saving his life, based upon a contract implied-in-fact.
C: The employee had a valid enforceable contract due to the boss's promise.
D: The employee's act of saving the boss's life constituted a legally enforceable contract.
E: The employee's act of saving the boss's life was sufficient past consideration to render enforceable the boss's subsequent promise.
F: The boss's promise was not legally binding as it was made under duress.
G: The employee's act of saving the boss's life was a gift and did not create a contractual obligation.
H: The boss's promise was voidable due to lack of consideration.
I: &s per the boss's oral promise, the employee had an enforceable lifetime employment contract.
J: The boss was under no legal obligation to promise the employee anything.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about contract law. Let me read through it carefully. 

The scenario is that an employee found his boss passed out, not breathing. He did CPR, revived him, called paramedics, and two weeks later the boss returned to work. The boss then told the employee, "You'll have a job with me for life." The question is about the legal relationship between them based on that promise.

The options are from A to J, each giving a different legal characterization. I need to determine which option is correct.

Hmm, I remember that in contract law, a valid contract requires offer, acceptance, and consideration. Consideration means both parties must exchange something of value. So if the boss promised lifetime employment, is that a binding contract?

The employee did CPR and saved the boss's life. But was there consideration for the boss's promise? The employee's action was a past consideration because it happened before the boss's promise. I think past consideration isn't sufficient for a contract. Because consideration must be bargained-for, meaning it's given in exchange for the promise.

So the boss's promise of lifetime employment came after the employee's action. The employee didn't do it in exchange for a job promise; he just acted out of emergency. So there's no consideration here. Without consideration, the promise isn't enforceable.

Looking at the options:

Option A says there's insufficient consideration because the employee's assistance was gratuitous. That sounds right because past consideration isn't enough.

Option E says the past consideration makes the promise enforceable. I don't think that's correct because past consideration isn't valid.

Option C says the employee has a valid contract, but without consideration, that's not the case.

Option H says the promise is voidable due to lack of consideration. I think it's not just voidable, it's unenforceable because the contract is lacking a required element.

Option J says the boss is under no legal obligation, which aligns because without consideration, the promise isn't binding.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused between A and E. Option E argues that past consideration is sufficient, but I thought that's not the case. So the correct answer must be either A or E.

Another point: sometimes courts might find that a promise based on past services can imply consideration if it's based on an antecedent promise or something. But in this case, the boss's promise came after the action, so it's a past consideration, which generally doesn't count.

So the correct reasoning is that there's no consideration, making the promise unenforceable. So the options that reflect this would be A, E, H, or J.

Wait, let me think again. The employee's action was a past consideration. So the boss's promise lacks consideration, so the contract isn't enforceable. So which option states that?

Option A: insufficient consideration because it's gratuitous. That seems correct because the employee didn't provide consideration for the promise.

Option E says past consideration is sufficient, which I think is wrong. So A is correct.

Wait, but option E is about past consideration being sufficient. So if I'm right that past consideration isn't enough, then E is wrong.

So the correct answer would be A, stating that there's insufficient consideration, so the promise isn't supported by a contract.

Alternatively, option H says the promise is voidable due to lack of consideration. But I think the contract isn't voidable; it's simply unenforceable because it's not a valid contract in the first place. So H might not be the best choice.

Option J says the boss is under no legal obligation. That's true because without consideration, the promise doesn't create a legal obligation. So both A and J seem possible.

Wait, what's the difference between A and J?

Option A says there's insufficient consideration, so no contract. Option J says the boss is under no legal obligation to promise anything, which is because there's no consideration.

So the correct answer would probably be A or J. But the question is about the legal relationship. If there's no consideration, no contract is formed, so the boss isn't legally bound.

Hmm, but option C says the employee has a valid contract. No, because no consideration.

So I think the correct answer is either A or E, but E is wrong. So A is correct.

Wait, another angle: the boss's promise might be considered a gift promise. But for a gift, you usually need a written document under the statute of frauds if it's a promise that can't be performed within a year. But this is an employment contract for life, which is a service that would take more than a year, so it might fall under the statute of frauds, requiring a writing. But the question doesn't mention a writing, so that's another issue. But the main issue here is consideration.

So the key point is that the employee's act was past consideration, which isn't valid. So the boss's promise isn't supported by consideration, making any contract unenforceable.

So the correct answer would be A: insufficient consideration.

Wait, but some sources say that if the promise is made in recognition of past services, it can sometimes be enforceable, but I think that's more in cases where there was an expectation of payment or prior agreement. Here, the employee didn't do it expecting anything, so it's purely past consideration.

Therefore, the best answer is A.

The scenario involves an employee who saved their boss's life, and the boss subsequently promised the employee lifetime employment. To determine the legal relationship, the key issue is whether the boss's promise is enforceable as a contract. For a contract to be valid, there must be offer, acceptance, and consideration. Consideration requires that something of value is exchanged between the parties, and it must be bargained-for, meaning it is given in exchange for the promise.

In this case, the employee's act of saving the boss's life occurred before the boss's promise of lifetime employment. This makes the employee's action a "past consideration," which is generally not sufficient to support a contract because it was not given in exchange for the promise. Without consideration, the boss's promise is not legally binding.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Correctly states that there is insufficient consideration because the employee's assistance was gratuitous and not bargained-for.
- **Option E**: Incorrect because past consideration is not sufficient to make the promise enforceable.
- **Option C**: Incorrect because there is no valid contract due to lack of consideration.
- **Option H**: Incorrect because the promise is not voidable; it is unenforceable from the start due to lack of consideration.
- **Option J**: While true that the boss is under no legal obligation, the better answer is A, which directly addresses the issue of consideration.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**A**

Answer: A
