Question:

Which of the following is not a reason for increased risk of vitamin or mineral deficiencies among older people in high income countries?

B: Decreased mobility and little time spend outdoors in the sunshine
C: Decreased intrinsic factor in the stomach
D: High nutrient requirements for tissue turnover

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about vitamin and mineral deficiencies in older people in high-income countries. Hmm, let me break it down.

The question is asking which option is NOT a reason for increased risk of deficiencies. So I need to find the option that's either a protective factor or unrelated.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Low income affecting ability to buy nutrient-rich foods. Wait, the question specifies high-income countries. If it's a high-income country, maybe low income isn't as big of a problem? Or does it mean even in high-income, some individuals might have low income? I'm a bit confused here. But I think in high-income countries, social safety nets might help, but it's possible that some older adults still have low income. So A could be a reason, making it not the correct answer.

Option B: Decreased mobility and little time outdoors. Less sun exposure means less vitamin D from sunlight. Vitamin D is important, so this would increase deficiency risk. So B is a reason, so not the answer.

Option C: Decreased intrinsic factor. Intrinsic factor is needed for vitamin B12 absorption. Older adults often have decreased stomach acid and intrinsic factor, leading to B12 deficiency. So C is a reason, not the answer.

Option D: High nutrient requirements for tissue turnover. Wait, I thought older people might have lower tissue turnover. High requirements would mean they need more nutrients, but if their intake is the same, they might be at risk. Or does it mean their bodies don't require as much? Wait, tissue turnover is the process of cells being replaced. I'm not sure if older people have higher or lower turnover. Wait, as we age, our cells might not regenerate as quickly, so maybe lower turnover. So if the question says high nutrient requirements, that's not accurate. Or maybe older people actually have higher requirements but can't meet them due to other factors. Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, let me think again. High nutrient requirements would mean they need more vitamins and minerals. If their diet doesn't meet this, they could be deficient. But is it true that older people have higher requirements? I recall that for some nutrients, like vitamin D and B12, the requirements might be higher or absorption is less efficient, but overall tissue turnover—like the rate of cell replacement—might slow down with age. So maybe older people don't have high nutrient requirements. So if the option says high nutrient requirements, that's not a reason for deficiency because their actual need might not be higher. So D would not be a reason, making it the correct answer.

Wait, but wait. The question is which is NOT a reason. So the incorrect reason. So if option D says high requirements, but in reality, older people might have similar or lower needs, then D is not a reason for deficiency. Because if they need more, but can't get it, that would increase risk. But if D says their bodies require more, but they can't absorb, then it's a reason. But if their actual need is lower, then high requirements wouldn't be a reason.

Alternatively, perhaps older people do have higher nutrient needs for certain reasons, like healing or maintaining tissues. Maybe their requirements are higher but intake is insufficient. But I'm not entirely certain.

Alternatively, maybe the question is trying to trick us into thinking that older people have higher requirements, but perhaps they don't. So D is incorrect as a reason.

Wait, another angle: the question is about which is NOT a reason. So three options are real reasons, and one isn't.

Option D: High nutrient requirements. If older people have higher nutrient needs, that would increase the risk if their intake is inadequate. So if they require more but aren't getting enough, that's a reason. But wait, do they have higher requirements? Or is their requirement the same or lower?

I'm a bit rusty on this. From what I remember, older adults might have higher requirements for some nutrients but not all. For example, vitamin D and calcium needs increase with age to support bone health. Protein requirements might stay the same or even increase a bit. But overall, it's possible that some nutrients have higher requirements.

If that's the case, then D would be a reason. But if their overall tissue turnover is lower, maybe their general nutrient needs are the same or lower, making D not a reason.

Wait, the option says "high nutrient requirements for tissue turnover." Tissue turnover is the rate at which cells are replaced. If older people have slower tissue turnover, their requirements for nutrients involved in cell division and growth (like protein, certain vitamins) might actually be lower. So if the option is stating that they have high requirements, that's incorrect. Because their actual tissue turnover is lower, so they don't have high requirements. So option D is not a reason for increased deficiency risk, making it the correct answer.

So the correct answer is D.

To determine which option is NOT a reason for increased risk of vitamin or mineral deficiencies among older people in high-income countries, each option must be analyzed:

- **Option A**: Low income can limit access to nutrient-rich foods, even in high-income countries, as not all individuals may have sufficient financial resources. This is a plausible reason for increased deficiency risk.

- **Option B**: Decreased mobility and less time spent outdoors reduce sun exposure, which is essential for vitamin D synthesis. This is a valid reason for increased deficiency risk.

- **Option C**: Decreased intrinsic factor in the stomach impairs vitamin B12 absorption, a common issue in older adults. This is also a valid reason for increased deficiency risk.

- **Option D**: The statement about "high nutrient requirements for tissue turnover" is questionable. While older adults may have higher requirements for certain nutrients (e.g., vitamin D, calcium), overall tissue turnover slows with age, suggesting that general nutrient requirements may not be higher. Therefore, this is NOT a valid reason for increased deficiency risk.

The correct answer is **D**, as it does not accurately reflect a reason for increased risk of vitamin or mineral deficiencies in older adults.
