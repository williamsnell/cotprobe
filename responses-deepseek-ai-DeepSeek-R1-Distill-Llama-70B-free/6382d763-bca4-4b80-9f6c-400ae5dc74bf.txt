Okay, so I have this parallel computing question here. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with parallel programs, not all parts can be made parallel. Some parts are inherently sequential, meaning they can't be split up and run on multiple processors. So the question is about finding the best possible elapsed times when running a program on 2 and 4 processors respectively.

The problem says the program takes 100 seconds on a single processor. Oh wait, and 40% of this computation is inherently sequential. So 40% of 100 seconds is 40 seconds. That means the sequential part takes 40 seconds, and the rest, which is 60 seconds, can be parallelized.

Wait, so the sequential part can't be sped up by adding processors. So no matter how many processors we add, that 40 seconds will stay as is. But the parallel part can be divided among the processors. So the maximum speedup comes from the parallel part being perfectly divided.

Let me think about the execution time. The total time with multiple processors would be the time taken by the sequential part plus the time taken by the parallel part divided by the number of processors.

So for the sequential part, it's fixed at 40 seconds. The parallel part is 60 seconds on one processor. So when we have P processors, the parallel time is 60 / P seconds.

So for 2 processors, the parallel time would be 60 / 2 = 30 seconds. Adding that to the sequential 40 gives 70 seconds total. Wait, wait, no, that can't be right. Because the sequential part is done on one processor. Oh wait, no, the sequential part is done in series with the parallel part. So the total time is the time for the sequential part plus the time for the parallel part divided by the number of processors.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Because the sequential part is done before or after the parallel part. So the total time is sequential_time + (parallel_time / number_of_processors).

Wait, no. Let me think again. The sequential parts can't be parallelized, so they have to be executed one after another, but the parallel parts can be split. So the total execution time is the maximum of (sequential_time, (parallel_time / number_of_processors)) plus any sequential parts that come after. Wait, no, that's not right. The sequential part is done entirely, and the parallel part is split.

Wait, perhaps I should model it as follows: the total execution time is the sum of the sequential part and the time taken for the parallel part when using multiple processors.

Wait, that doesn't sound right. Because the sequential part is done on a single processor, and the parallel part is done in parallel. But in reality, the sequential part is done first, and then the parallel part is executed. Or perhaps the program has some sequential parts and some that can be parallelized. So the total time is the time for the sequential part plus the time for the parallel part when run in parallel.

Wait, no, that's not accurate. Let me think of Amdahl's Law. Amdahl's Law is used to find the maximum possible speedup of a program when parallelized. The formula is:

Speedup = 1 / ( (fraction_serial) + (fraction_parallel / number_of_processors) )

But wait, the elapsed time would be the time on a single processor divided by the speedup.

So the single processor time is 100 seconds. The fraction_serial is 0.4 (40%), fraction_parallel is 0.6 (60%).

So for 2 processors, the speedup is 1 / (0.4 + (0.6/2)) = 1 / (0.4 + 0.3) = 1 / 0.7 ≈ 1.4286. So the elapsed time would be 100 / 1.4286 ≈ 70 seconds.

Wait, but let me recalculate that. 1/(0.4 + 0.3) = 1/0.7 ≈ 1.42857. So speedup is about 1.42857. So elapsed time is 100 / 1.42857 ≈ 70 seconds.

Similarly, for 4 processors, the denominator becomes 0.4 + (0.6/4) = 0.4 + 0.15 = 0.55. So speedup is 1/0.55 ≈ 1.81818. So elapsed time is 100 / 1.81818 ≈ 55 seconds.

Wait, but looking at the options, when I check for 2 and 4 processors, the times would be 70 and 55. Let me look at the options:

Option F says 70 and 55 seconds. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me think again. The way I calculated the elapsed time using Amdahl's Law gives 70 and 55, which matches option F.

Alternatively, without using Amdahl's Law, let's think in terms of the maximum time.

The sequential part is 40 seconds. The parallel part is 60 seconds when on one processor. So with P processors, the parallel part takes 60/P seconds.

So the total elapsed time is the sequential part plus the parallel part's time on P processors.

Wait, no. Because the sequential part is done on a single processor, so it's 40 seconds. The parallel part is 60 seconds of work, but when using P processors, that part takes 60 / P seconds. But these two parts are done in sequence, so the total time is 40 + (60 / P).

So for P=2: 40 + 60/2 = 40 + 30 =70 seconds.

For P=4: 40 + 60/4= 40+15=55 seconds.

So the times are 70 and 55. Which is option F. So that's the correct answer.

To determine the theoretically best possible elapsed times for the program running on 2 and 4 processors, we analyze the problem using the given data:

1. **Single Processor Time**: The program takes 100 seconds on a single processor.
2. **Inherently Sequential Portion**: 40% of the computation (40 seconds) is inherently sequential and cannot benefit from additional processors.
3. **Parallelizable Portion**: The remaining 60% (60 seconds) can be parallelized.

The total execution time when using multiple processors is the sum of the sequential time and the parallel time divided by the number of processors. For a given number of processors \( P \), the elapsed time is:

\[
\text{Elapsed Time} = \text{Sequential Time} + \frac{\text{Parallel Time}}{P}
\]

### For 2 Processors:
\[
\text{Elapsed Time} = 40 + \frac{60}{2} = 40 + 30 = 70 \, \text{seconds}
\]

### For 4 Processors:
\[
\text{Elapsed Time} = 40 + \frac{60}{4} = 40 + 15 = 55 \, \text{seconds}
\]

Thus, the best possible elapsed times for 2 and 4 processors are 70 seconds and 55 seconds, respectively. Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**F: 70 and 55 seconds**
