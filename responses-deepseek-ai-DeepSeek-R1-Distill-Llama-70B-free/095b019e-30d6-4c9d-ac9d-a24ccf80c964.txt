Question:

Which of the following best describes a key difference between the short-run and long-run aggregate supply curve?

Options:

A: Long-run aggregate supply is upward sloping as nominal wages do not quickly respond to price level changes.
B: Long-run aggregate supply is upward sloping as nominal wages quickly respond to price level changes.
C: Short-run aggregate supply is downward sloping as nominal wages do not quickly respond to price level changes.
D: Short-run aggregate supply is upward sloping as nominal wages quickly respond to price level changes.
E: Long-run aggregate supply is vertical as nominal wages do not quickly respond to price level changes.
F: Short-run aggregate supply is horizontal as nominal wages do not quickly respond to price level changes.
G: Short-run aggregate supply is upward sloping as nominal wages do not quickly respond to price level changes.
H: Short-run aggregate supply is vertical as nominal wages quickly respond to price level changes.
I: Long-run aggregate supply is downward sloping as nominal wages quickly respond to price level changes.

Okay, so I have this economics question here about aggregate supply curves. Hmm, I remember that aggregate supply has both short-run and long-run aspects. Let me think.

The question is asking about the key difference between the short-run and long-run aggregate supply curves. I think the main thing is how nominal wages behave in each case.

In the short run, I remember that nominal wages don't adjust quickly to changes in the price level. So when the price level changes, workers might not immediately adjust their wages, which affects the cost of production. If prices rise but wages don't, production costs stay the same, so firms are more willing to produce. So the short-run aggregate supply curve is upward sloping. Because as prices go up, quantity supplied increases.

Wait, but why is it upward sloping? Oh right, because with higher prices and same nominal wages, real wages are lower. Firms see lower real wages, so their costs are lower, so they produce more. Hence, the short-run curve slopes upward.

Now, the long-run is different. In the long run, nominal wages can adjust. If the price level increases, nominal wages eventually catch up. So real wages go back to their original level. That means production costs go back to where they were before. So the long-run aggregate supply isn't affected by price changes in the same way. I think the long-run curve is vertical because, in the long run, the economy returns to its potential output regardless of the price level. Because when prices rise, wages rise too, so firms don't change their output.

Wait, let me double-check. The short-run curve is upward sloping because of sticky wages. The long-run curve is vertical because, with all prices (including wages) adjusting, the supply of real GDP is determined by factors like technology and resources, not the price level.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Long-run AS is upward sloping because nominal wages don't respond quickly. No, that's wrong because in long-run, wages do respond.

Option B: Long-run AS upward because wages respond quickly. No, long-run AS is vertical.

Option C: Short-run AS downward sloping. No, it's upward sloping.

Option D: Short-run is upward because wages respond quickly. No, because in short-run, wages don't respond quickly.

Option E: Long-run vertical because wages don't respond. No, in long-run they do respond.

Option F: Short-run is horizontal. No, that's not right. Short-run is upward.

Option G: Short-run is upward because wages don't respond. Yes, that's correct. Because in the short run, nominal wages are sticky, so when price level rises, real wages fall, leading firms to supply more.

So looking at the options, G says: Short-run aggregate supply is upward sloping as nominal wages do not quickly respond to price level changes. That's exactly what I was thinking.

Wait, but the question is about the key difference between the two. The options might be describing each curve's behavior. So the correct answer should point out that the short-run is upward sloping because of sticky wages, and long-run is vertical because wages adjust.

Looking again, the question is which option best describes the key difference. So which option correctly states the behavior.

So the correct answer should be G, because it correctly describes the short-run curve, which differentiates it from the long-run.

The key difference between the short-run and long-run aggregate supply curves lies in how nominal wages respond to changes in the price level. In the short run, nominal wages are "sticky" and do not quickly adjust to price level changes. This makes the short-run aggregate supply curve upward sloping: as the price level rises, real wages fall, reducing production costs and leading firms to increase output. In contrast, in the long run, nominal wages fully adjust to price level changes, restoring real wages to their original level. As a result, the long-run aggregate supply curve is vertical, meaning that changes in the price level do not affect the quantity of goods and services supplied in the long run.

Among the options provided, **G** correctly describes the short-run aggregate supply curve as upward sloping because nominal wages do not quickly respond to price level changes. This aligns with the explanation of the short-run curve's behavior.

Answer: G
