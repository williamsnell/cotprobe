Okay, so I've got this question about Velleman's views on euthanasia. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. The question is asking who should decide whether a patient receives euthanasia according to Velleman. The options are from A to J, with various choices like court, family, physician, etc.

I remember that Velleman is a philosopher who's written about autonomy and medical ethics. I think his stance is that the patient should have the right to make decisions about their own life. Autonomy is a big deal in medical ethics, right? So the idea is that patients have the right to decide what happens to their own bodies.

Wait, but sometimes patients can't make decisions for themselves, like if they're in a coma or have dementia. In those cases, who decides? But the question is about who should decide, not necessarily in every possible scenario. So according to Velleman, I think the main point is that it's the patient's choice when they're competent. He probably argues against paternalism, where others make decisions for the patient's own good.

I should also consider other options. Like, option G is the patient's physician. But if the decision is the patient's, then the physician might just be carrying out the patient's wishes. Option J is the patient, which aligns with autonomy. So the answer is likely J.

Wait, but I vaguely remember that Velleman might have discussed cases where the patient can't decide, but the question is about who should decide, not specifically about when the patient is incapacitated. The question doesn't specify, so I think the general principle is that the patient should decide if they can.

So putting it all together, the answer should be J: the patient.

The question asks who should decide whether a patient receives euthanasia according to Velleman. Considering Velleman's emphasis on patient autonomy and the importance of individuals making decisions about their own bodies, the answer aligns with the principle that the patient should decide if they are competent. While other options like the physician or family might play roles in cases of incapacity, the question focuses on the decision-maker, which is the patient themselves.

Answer: J
