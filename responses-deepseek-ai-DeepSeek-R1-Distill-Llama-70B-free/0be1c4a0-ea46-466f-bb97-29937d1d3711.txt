Okay, so I've got this question about Dr. Harry Holliday, a clinical psychologist, who's planning a three-week cruise. The question is asking what his best course of action should be regarding his clinical practice. Let me try to break this down.

First, I need to think about the ethical considerations for psychologists when they're going to be unavailable. I remember that professionals, especially in mental health, have a responsibility to ensure their clients are taken care of even when they're not around. So, what are the options here?

Looking at the options:

A: Leave without informing his clients. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. Clients might show up for appointments and find no one there, which is unprofessional and could cause anxiety.

B: Give a phone number where he can be reached. But he's on a cruise, maybe in areas with no signal? Plus, he's supposed to be on vacation, so being reachable might not be feasible or fair to him.

C: Provide online resources. That's a possibility. It gives clients some tools, but it doesn't address the immediate need for support if something urgent comes up.

D: Continue sessions via phone or video. That might be possible, but a three-week cruise might have internet issues. Also, he's supposed to be taking a break, so maybe not ideal.

E: Inform clients a day before. That's probably too last-minute. Clients might have issues or need to make arrangements, so not giving them enough notice isn't good.

F: Cancel appointments without telling clients. That's worse than option A. Clients would be left hanging without any notice.

G: Discuss his plans ahead of time. This sounds good because it's about informed consent and giving clients time to adjust. They can make other plans if needed.

H: Hire a colleague to take over. That's a solid option because it ensures continuity of care. But the question is about what Dr. Holliday should do, not necessarily hiring someone else unless he does so.

I: Give clients a colleague's number for emergencies. That's a good backup plan, ensuring clients have someone to contact urgently.

J: Arrange a colleague for emergencies only. Similar to I, but maybe more specific about emergency sessions.

So, the best course of action would involve informing the clients ahead of time (so G) and possibly arranging for emergency coverage (like I or J). But the question is asking for the best option among these.

I think the key here is that Dr. Holliday should inform his clients in advance. That way, they're aware and can plan accordingly. It's about respecting their autonomy and ensuring they're prepared. So G is a strong candidate.

But wait, what about ensuring they have someone to contact in emergencies? Option I or J cover that aspect. But the question is about his best course of action. So maybe the best is to inform them ahead of time (G) and perhaps arrange for emergency coverage, but that might be two actions. However, the options are individual choices.

So, the question is asking what his best action is. So, the most important step is informing the clients ahead of time. That way, they know and can make their own arrangements if needed. It's part of professional ethics to communicate such absences.

So the answer would be G.

The best course of action for Dr. Harry Holliday is to inform his clients ahead of time about his vacation. This ensures they are aware of his absence and can make necessary arrangements, aligning with professional ethics and respect for clients' needs.

Answer: G
