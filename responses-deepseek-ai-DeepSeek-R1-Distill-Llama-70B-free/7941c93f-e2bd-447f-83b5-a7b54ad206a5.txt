Okay, so I need to answer this multiple-choice question about Margaret Mead's 1935 study of three New Guinea tribes and what her findings indicate about culture's effect on personality. Let me think through this.

First, I remember that Margaret Mead was an anthropologist known for her work on how culture influences behavior and personality. Her studies often focused on different cultures, especially in the Pacific, like Samoa and New Guinea. 

The question is about her study of three tribes in New Guinea. From what I've read before, Mead's work, particularly in "Sex and Temperament in Three Primitive Societies," looked at how different cultures shape the personalities of their members. She studied the Arapesh, Mundugumor, and Tchambuli tribes, if I recall correctly.

Each of these tribes had different cultural norms. For example, the Arapesh were known for being cooperative and peaceful, while the Mundugumor were more aggressive and competitive. The Tchambuli, interestingly, had different gender roles compared to Western societies, with women taking on more dominant roles. 

Mead's findings suggested that personality traits are not fixed but are instead shaped by cultural factors. She observed that traits like dominance or submission, which might be seen as masculine or feminine in Western cultures, could vary widely based on the cultural context. For instance, in one tribe, both men and women might be more nurturing, while in another, aggression was more common.

Looking at the options provided:

A: Culture has no effect on personality traits. That can't be right because Mead's work was all about showing that culture does influence personality.

B: Personality traits, especially those related to dominance, vary depending on the culture. This sounds correct because she showed how dominance and other traits differed across the tribes based on their cultural practices.

C: The differences were insignificant. No, her study highlighted significant differences, so this isn't correct.

D: Only one tribe showed variation due to culture. No, all three tribes showed different traits based on their culture.

E: Personality traits are universally consistent. That's the opposite of what Mead found.

F: Environment has a stronger effect than culture. I don't think her study focused on environment so much as culture, so this might not be the right choice.

G: Genetics determine traits. Mead's study was about culture, not genetics, so this is incorrect.

H: Cultural norms have no distinct patterns. No, she found clear patterns in each culture.

I: Traits are same across all cultures. Again, opposite of her findings.

J: Biological factors are primary. Her study emphasized culture over biology, so this is wrong.

So the correct answer must be B. It aligns with Mead's conclusion that cultural factors significantly influence personality traits, especially in areas like dominance and gender roles.

The correct answer is B: Personality traits, especially those related to dominance, vary depending on the culture.

Answer: B
