Question:

A person who has had an opportunity to contribute to the establishmentof objectives regarding his or her performance willhave a greater degree of commitment and motivation in attemptingto achieve those objectives. State and discuss thetheory underlying this statement. How is itimplemented practicallyto motivate employees ?

Options:

A: The theory is the Hierarchy of Needs by Maslow, and it is implemented by providing employees with a path for career progression and fulfilling higher-level needs.
B: The theory is implemented through punishments and rewards
C: The theory is known as the Two-Factor Theory by Herzberg, which is applied by addressing hygiene factors and providing intrinsic motivators such as recognition and achievement.
D: The theory is implemented through increasing employee's workload
E: The theory is implemented through strict supervision
F: The theory is known as the Equity Theory, which is put into practice by ensuring fair treatment of employees and balancing input and output ratios among workers.
G: The theory is the Self-Determination Theory, which is implemented by promoting autonomy, competence, and relatedness in the workplace.
H: The theory is the Social Learning Theory, and it is put into practice by using role models and mentors to demonstrate desirable behaviors and outcomes.
I: The theory underlying this statement is Management by Objectives (MBO), which involves mutual goal-setting between employees and management. It is practically implemented through programs such as job simplification, job enrichment, suggestion plans, and job redesign.
J: The theory is based on the Expectancy Theory of motivation, implemented through clear communication of performance criteria and linking outcomes directly to performance.

Okay, so I've got this question about motivation theories and their practical implementations. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question states that when a person has the opportunity to contribute to setting their performance objectives, they're more committed and motivated. It's asking which theory underlies this and how it's implemented in practice.

First, I remember that several motivation theories exist. Let me go through them one by one.

Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs talks about different levels of needs, from basic to self-actualization. But the question is about setting objectives, so maybe not directly related here.

Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory differentiates between hygiene factors and motivators. Hygiene factors prevent dissatisfaction, while motivators like recognition and achievement improve satisfaction. But does this involve setting objectives? Not sure yet.

Equity Theory is about fairness, comparing inputs and outputs. If employees feel they're treated fairly, they're more motivated. But the question is about setting goals, so maybe not this one.

Self-Determination Theory focuses on autonomy, competence, and relatedness. Autonomy means having control over their work, which might tie into setting their own objectives. That's a possibility.

Management by Objectives (MBO) definitely involves setting clear goals between employees and management. That sounds exactly like what the question is describing. MBO is a process where employees participate in setting their own goals, which aligns with higher commitment.

Then there's Expectancy Theory, which says motivation is based on the expectation of rewards and the perceived effort. If they believe their effort leads to desired outcomes, they're more motivated. But the question isn't about rewards, it's about setting the objectives themselves.

Looking at the options:

Option I says the theory is MBO, implemented through mutual goal-setting, and mentions programs like job simplification, etc. That fits because MBO is all about collaborative goal setting.

Option G is about Self-Determination Theory, which involves autonomy. Setting your own objectives would support autonomy, so that could also be a fit.

Wait, but the question is about the theory underlying the statement. The statement is about contributing to the establishment of objectives leading to more commitment. That's exactly what MBO is aboutâ€”mutual goal setting. So the theory would be MBO.

Looking back at the options, option I states that the theory is MBO. The implementation part in I includes job simplification, etc., but MBO is more about the goal-setting process itself. So I think I is the correct answer.

Another option, option J talks about Expectancy Theory, but that's more about the link between performance and outcomes, not setting the objectives themselves.

Option G's Self-Determination Theory does involve autonomy, which is part of it, but the primary theory here is MBO because it's directly about setting objectives together.

So the answer should be I.

The theory underlying the statement is Management by Objectives (MBO), which involves mutual goal-setting between employees and management. This approach enhances commitment and motivation as employees contribute to establishing their performance objectives. It is implemented through collaborative processes and programs like job redesign and suggestion plans.
