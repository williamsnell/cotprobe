Okay, so I have this question about removing ink stains, and I need to figure out which of the given options is useful for that. Let's think through this step by step.

First, the question is multiple-choice, with options A through G. The task is to pick the correct one. The options are a bit varied, so I'll need to consider each one.

I remember that ink stains can be tricky, and different methods work depending on the type of ink and the surface it's on. For example, on fabric, some common remedies are laundry pre-treatments, but here the options don't include those, so I need to think about other household items.

Option A: Hair spray. I've heard that hairspray can be used on ink stains, especially on clothing. The alcohol in hairspray can help break down the ink. So this might be a good candidate.

Option B: Butter. Hmm, butter is a fat, and sometimes fats can help with certain stains, like grease, but I'm not sure about ink. Maybe it's more for absorbing or softening? I'm not certain if it works for ink.

Option C: Toothpaste. Toothpaste is abrasive and can sometimes help with stains, but I'm not sure if it's effective for ink. It's more commonly used for things like removing scuff marks from shoes or minor stains on surfaces.

Option D: Baking soda. Baking soda is a mild abrasive and can help absorb some stains. It's often used in combination with water to make a paste. I think it's more for stains like food or grass, though. Not sure about ink.

Option E: Nail polish. Wait, nail polish remover contains acetone, which can sometimes help with ink, but the question is about nail polish itself. I don't think nail polish would help; in fact, it might make the stain worse by adding more color.

Option F: Olive oil. Olive oil is used for various cleaning purposes. It's a lubricant and can sometimes help with grease or paint stains, but I'm not sure about ink. Maybe it's more for oil-based stains.

Option G: Coffee grounds. Coffee grounds are abrasive and can sometimes be used for cleaning, but I don't recall them being used for ink. They might even dye the surface, so that's probably not it.

So, considering all these, the most likely option is A: hair spray. I've heard before that hairspray can help remove ink, especially on fabrics. The alcohol in it helps dissolve the ink, making it easier to wash out. The other options don't seem as directly applicable to ink removal.

The correct answer is A: hair spray. Hair spray contains alcohol, which can help dissolve and remove ink stains, especially on fabrics. Other options like butter, toothpaste, baking soda, olive oil, and coffee grounds are less effective or more suited for different types of stains. Nail polish might worsen the stain rather than remove it.

Answer: A
