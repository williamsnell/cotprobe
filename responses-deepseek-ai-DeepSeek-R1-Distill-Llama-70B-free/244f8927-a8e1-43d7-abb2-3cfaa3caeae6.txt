Okay, so I've got this question about the absorption rate of methane in two different scenarios when the total pressure changes from 1 atm to 3 atm. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that absorption rates are influenced by factors like the solute's partial pressure in the gas phase and how it's dissolved in the solvent. Oh wait, and the resistance to mass transfer can be a big deal too—like whether it's the gas film or the liquid film that's the main resistor.

Looking at the first situation (I): It's the absorption of methane from an air-methane mixture which is 15% CH4 by volume. They're using pure water as the solvent. And the gas film offers the main resistance.

So, when the gas film is the main resistance, the rate of absorption depends on the partial pressure of the solute in the gas phase. The absorption rate equation in such cases is typically proportional to the partial pressure of the solute. 

Methane's volume percentage is 15%, so at 1 atm, the partial pressure is 0.15 atm. If the total pressure increases to 3 atm, the partial pressure would triple, right? Because partial pressure is mole fraction times total pressure. So 0.15 * 3 = 0.45 atm. 

Since the rate is proportional to the partial pressure, tripling the partial pressure should triple the absorption rate. Wait no, wait—when the gas film is the controlling factor, the rate equation is often something like N = (k * P_partial) / (R * T), but wait, actually, I think it's more like the absorption rate is proportional to the partial pressure difference. 

But wait, if the solution is pure water, the solubility of methane might be a factor. Henry's Law comes into play, where the concentration in the liquid is proportional to the partial pressure in the gas. So, if P increases, the concentration gradient increases, leading to a higher absorption rate.

So in case I, increasing pressure from 1 to 3 atm would increase the partial pressure of CH4 from 0.15 to 0.45 atm, which is a threefold increase. So the absorption rate should go up by a factor of 3. But looking at the options, none of them mention a tripling. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, the question is about the effect on the absorption rate due to raising the pressure. So in case I, since the gas film is the main resistance, the rate is directly proportional to P. So the rate would triple. But looking at the options, let me see. Option E says a 25% increase in the first case, which doesn't match. Option F says 50% gain, which also doesn't fit. Hmm, maybe I'm thinking about this wrong.

Wait, wait, no. Because when the gas film is the main resistance, the absorption rate equation is N = (k * P * y) / (R*T), but wait, if the solution is pure solvent, the driving force is the partial pressure in the gas minus the partial pressure in the solution. But if the solution is pure water, the vapor pressure of methane in the solution is zero (since pure water doesn't dissolve much, but wait, in reality, pure water has some solubility, but I'm not sure). Alternatively, maybe the overall approach is to use the concept that when the gas phase resistance controls, the rate is proportional to the partial pressure of the solute.

So in case I, the rate increases by a factor of 3. But the options don't have that. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's look at situation II.

Situation II: The absorption is from a 25% CH4 mixture. But the solvent is a solution of CH4 in water, and the vapor pressure over the solution is 0.17 atm.

So here, the solvent isn't pure water; it's already a solution where CH4 has some vapor pressure. So the partial pressure of CH4 in the gas phase is 0.25 * total pressure. 

At 1 atm, that's 0.25 atm. But the vapor pressure (equilibrium pressure) is 0.17 atm. So the driving force is (0.25 - 0.17) = 0.08 atm.

When the pressure increases to 3 atm, the partial pressure becomes 0.25 *3 = 0.75 atm. The vapor pressure remains 0.17 atm (assuming temperature is constant, so Henry's law holds). So the driving force becomes (0.75 - 0.17) = 0.58 atm.

Wait, but if the gas film is the main resistance, then the rate is proportional to (P_partial - P_vapor). So at 1 atm, rate is proportional to 0.08. At 3 atm, it's 0.58. So the rate increases by a factor of 0.58 / 0.08 = 7.25 times. That's a huge increase. But the options don't have such a big jump.

Wait, but wait—maybe the main resistance isn't the gas film in the second case. Wait, the question states for each case whether the gas film is the main resistance. Oh, no, the way the question is written: (I) says the gas film offers the main resistance. But (II) doesn't say that; it just describes the solvent. So perhaps in (II), the resistance isn't in the gas film but maybe in the liquid film. 

Wait, no, the question says for each case, so situation I: gas film is main resistance. Situation II: the solvent is a solution, but the question doesn't mention where the resistance is. Hmm, perhaps I'm misinterpreting. Wait, let me read the question again.

Wait, the question says for each case: (I) says the gas film offers the main resistance. (II) says that the solvent is a solution of CH4 in water, and gives the vapor pressure. It doesn't say anything about where the resistance is. So perhaps in (II), the main resistance is elsewhere, like the liquid phase.

Wait, but the question is about the effect of pressure on the absorption rate. So in (I), since gas film is the main resistance, the rate is proportional to the partial pressure. In (II), if the main resistance is in the liquid film, then the rate would be controlled by the liquid-phase concentration gradient, which is governed by the solubility. 

But wait, if the resistance is in the liquid, then the rate equation would be based on the concentration difference in the liquid. But when the pressure increases, the liquid phase concentration would increase due to Henry's Law. But if the liquid film is the main resistor, then perhaps the rate isn't affected by the gas pressure because the liquid is already in equilibrium. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think.

Wait, when the main resistance is in the gas film (case I), increasing the partial pressure of CH4 would increase the rate. In case II, if the main resistance is in the liquid, then the rate is more dependent on the concentration gradient in the liquid, which is governed by the difference between the solubility (from the gas) and the bulk liquid concentration. 

In case II, the solvent is a solution where the vapor pressure is 0.17 atm. So if the partial pressure in the gas is P, the concentration in the liquid is proportional to P - 0.17. But if the main resistance is in the liquid, then the rate is determined by how quickly the solute diffuses through the liquid. 

Wait, but in reality, if the main resistance is in the gas phase, then the rate is proportional to (P - P_vapor). If the main resistance is in the liquid, then the rate is proportional to (C_surface - C_bulk), which depends on the liquid's solubility. But when you increase the pressure, if the main resistance is in the liquid, perhaps the rate doesn't change as much because the surface concentration is determined by the gas partial pressure.

Wait, perhaps I should consider each case separately.

Case I:
- Gas film resistance dominant.
- Pure water as solvent, so vapor pressure of CH4 is negligible (but actually, it's not zero; pure water can dissolve some CH4, but in this case, perhaps the vapor pressure is considered zero).
Wait, but in case I, maybe the gas is pure CH4? No, no, the question says air-CH4 mixture. So the partial pressure of CH4 is 0.15 atm at 1 atm total pressure.

Assuming that the solution is pure water, the concentration of CH4 in the liquid (C) is proportional to the partial pressure in the gas (Henry's Law: C = H * P_CH4). So the rate of absorption would be proportional to (P_CH4 - P_CH4_liq), but if the solution is pure, P_CH4_liq is zero, so rate is proportional to P_CH4.

So when pressure increases to 3 atm, P_CH4 becomes 0.45 atm. So the rate is (0.45 / 0.15) = 3 times higher. So the absorption rate triples. But looking at the options, none directly say that. The options only go up to a 200% increase, but 3 times is 200% increase (since it's tripled). 

But wait, the options don't have that for case I. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option J: No effect in case I, and 126% increase in case II.

Option E: 25% increase in I, 10% decrease in II.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe in case I, the rate is proportional to the partial pressure, so tripling the pressure would triple the rate. So the absorption rate increases by 200% (since from 1x to 3x is 200% increase). But none of the options have that for case I.

Wait, looking back, perhaps I made a mistake. Because in case I, if the gas film is the main resistance, then the absorption rate depends on the partial pressure. So tripling the partial pressure would triple the rate. So from 1 atm to 3 atm, the rate goes up by a factor of 3. 

In case II, the main resistance is not in the gas film. Because in case II, the solvent is a solution where the vapor pressure is 0.17 atm. So perhaps in case II, the main resistance is in the liquid. So the rate would depend on the concentration gradient in the liquid phase. 

Wait, but the question doesn't specify where the resistance is in case II. Oh wait, in the question, only case I states that the gas film offers the main resistance. Case II doesn't specify, which is confusing. So perhaps I need to make an assumption.

Alternatively, perhaps in case II, the main resistance is in the gas film as well. Or maybe not. This is getting a bit tricky.

Wait, maybe in case II, the solvent is a solution of CH4, so the partial pressure in the liquid is higher than in case I. So the driving force is (partial pressure in gas - partial pressure in liquid). So when the pressure increases, the driving force increases, leading to higher absorption rate. But if in case II, the main resistance is in the liquid, then the rate is controlled by the liquid's diffusion, which may not depend on pressure.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to approach this differently.

In case I:

- Gas film resistance.
- Pure water, so P_vapor = 0.
- So rate is proportional to P_CH4.
- P increases from 1 to 3 atm, so P_CH4 increases from 0.15 to 0.45 atm. So rate increases by a factor of 3.

In case II:

- Solvent is a solution where the vapor pressure is 0.17 atm.
- So when the total pressure is 1 atm, P_CH4 is 0.25 atm.
- The driving force is (0.25 - 0.17) = 0.08 atm.
- When pressure is 3 atm, P_CH4 is 0.75 atm. Driving force is (0.75 - 0.17) = 0.58 atm.
- So the driving force increases by 0.58 / 0.08 = 7.25 times.

But if the main resistance is in the gas film, then the rate would be proportional to the driving force, so it would increase by 7.25 times. But if the main resistance is somewhere else, perhaps the liquid, then the rate might not depend on the gas pressure as much.

But the problem is that the question doesn't specify where the resistance is in case II. It only specifies for case I. So perhaps in case II, the resistance is in the liquid, meaning that the gas phase is not the controlling factor. So the rate would depend on the concentration gradient in the liquid.

Wait, but if the main resistance is in the liquid, then the rate would be determined by the liquid-phase concentration difference. The concentration at the interface would be proportional to the partial pressure in the gas, but if the main resistance is in the liquid, then the rate is (C_surface - C_bulk) / resistance. 

But without knowing if the bulk concentration is significant, perhaps the assumption is that the rate is more influenced by the partial pressure. Alternatively, maybe in case II, the gas is not pure, so the main resistance is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps in case II, since they are using a solution that already has some CH4, the vapor pressure is non-zero. So the main resistance could be in the gas phase or the liquid phase, but the question doesn't say. So perhaps in case II, the rate is not affected by pressure because the driving force is (P - P_vapor), but if the main resistance is in the liquid, then the rate is controlled by how much can be absorbed in the liquid, which might be independent of pressure once the interface concentration is fixed.

Wait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to think of the two scenarios.

In case I: rate ∝ P_CH4 (since gas film is main resistance, and P_vapor is 0). So when P increases, rate increases proportionally.

In case II: if the main resistance is in the liquid, then the rate depends on (C_surface - C_bulk). C_surface is proportional to P_CH4 (from Henry's Law), but if the main resistance is in the liquid, then once C_surface is fixed, the rate is determined by how fast it diffuses through the liquid, which may not depend on P. Alternatively, if the main resistance is in the gas, then rate would depend on (P_CH4 - P_vapor).

But since the question doesn't specify where the resistance is in case II, perhaps we have to assume that the same as case I, but that's not a given. Alternatively, perhaps in case II, the solution's vapor pressure is non-zero, so the driving force is (P_CH4 - P_vapor), and the rate is proportional to that.

Wait, but in case I, the rate is proportional to P_CH4 because P_vapor is negligible. In case II, the rate is proportional to (P_CH4 - P_vapor), which for case II at 1 atm is 0.25 - 0.17 = 0.08, and at 3 atm is 0.75 - 0.17 = 0.58. So the rate would increase by a factor of 7.25, but that's not reflected in any of the options.

Looking at the options, perhaps I've made a mistake. Let me check the options again.

Option J: No effect in case I, and 126% gain in case II.

Wait, but that can't be right because in case I, the rate should increase.

Wait, perhaps in case II, the absorption is governed by the liquid film. So the rate depends on the concentration gradient in the liquid. The concentration at the surface is C = H * P_CH4, and the bulk concentration is C_bulk. If the solution is already saturated, then C_bulk is high, so the gradient is small. So when pressure increases, C_surface increases, but if the main resistance is in the liquid, then the rate is (C_surface - C_bulk) / (liquid film resistance). But without knowing C_bulk, it's hard to say. But perhaps in case II, the rate doesn't change because the main resistance is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps in case II, the solvent is a solution where the vapor pressure is 0.17 atm. So at 1 atm, the partial pressure is 0.25, so the driving force is 0.08 atm. At 3 atm, the partial pressure is 0.75, so the driving force is 0.58 atm. If the gas film is the main resistance, then the rate would increase by 0.58/0.08 = 7.25 times. But if the main resistance is in the liquid, then the rate is determined by the concentration gradient in the liquid, which is proportional to (C_surface - C_bulk). If C_bulk is zero (pure solvent), then C_surface is proportional to P_CH4, so the rate would increase with P. But if the solvent is a solution with some CH4 already, then C_bulk is non-zero, and the change in C_surface with P would have a different effect.

Hmm, this is getting too tangled. Maybe I should look for a more straightforward approach.

Alternatively, perhaps for case I, the rate increases because the partial pressure of CH4 increases. For case II, if the solution has a significant vapor pressure, then the driving force (P_CH4 - P_vapor) increases, so the rate increases as well. But looking at the options, none have both cases increasing except option B. But option B says the rate increases in both cases.

Wait, but in case II, when the pressure increases, the driving force (P_CH4 - P_vapor) increases, so the rate increases. So both cases would have increased absorption rates. So option B would say 'increases in both cases.' Let me check option B.

Option B: Pressure change increases absorption rate in both cases.

But wait, in case I, the rate increases by a factor of 3 (from 0.15 to 0.45), which is a 200% increase. In case II, the rate increases by 7.25 times, which is a 625% increase. But the options don't have such specific numbers. So perhaps the correct answer is that in case I, the rate increases, and in case II, the rate also increases, so option B.

But looking back at the options, option J says no effect in case I and a 126% gain in case II. That doesn't match my analysis.

Wait, another angle: in case I, the gas film is the main resistance, so rate ∝ P_CH4. So when pressure triples, rate triples.

In case II, if the gas film is not the main resistance, perhaps the rate is independent of pressure. Or if the main resistance is in the liquid, then the rate is determined by the concentration gradient in the liquid. If the concentration in the liquid is fixed, then the rate doesn
