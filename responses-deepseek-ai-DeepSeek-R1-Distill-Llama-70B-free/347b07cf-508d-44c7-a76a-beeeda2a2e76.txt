Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. But I'll try to walk through it step by step.

The question is about calculating the change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for the isothermal expansion of an ideal gas. The given values are: 2.25 moles of gas at 325 K. The gas expands from an initial pressure of 12.0 bar to a final pressure of 2.5 bar.

Hmm, I remember that for processes involving ideal gases, there are specific formulas related to changes in thermodynamic quantities. Since the temperature is constant here (isothermal), that should simplify things a bit.

I think the formula for ΔG when the process is isothermal and reversible involves the natural logarithm of the pressure change. The formula is ΔG = nRT ln(P_final / P_initial). Wait, but wait—does that apply here? Oh right, because Gibbs free energy change for an ideal gas undergoing an isothermal process can be calculated using that formula.

Wait, but wait again. I'm a bit confused about whether it's P_final over P_initial or the other way around. Because when a gas expands, the pressure decreases. So if the system is doing work, is the process spontaneous? Well, ΔG tells us about spontaneity. A negative ΔG means the process is spontaneous under constant temperature and pressure.

So, the formula I should use is ΔG = nRT ln(P_final / P_initial). Let me plug in the numbers.

First, n is 2.25 moles. R is the gas constant. Wait, what value of R should I use here? Since the pressure is given in bar, I think R is 8.314 J/(mol·K). But wait, sometimes when pressure is in bar, using R=8.314 is fine because it's in SI units. Alternatively, if pressure were in atm, R would be 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), but that's for calculating work with pressure in atm. But in this case, since it's the ratio of pressures, the units might cancel out, so R can be 8.314 J/(mol·K).

The temperature T is 325 K.

The initial pressure P_initial is 12.0 bar, and final P_final is 2.5 bar. So the ratio P_final / P_initial is 2.5 /12.0. Let me compute that: 2.5 divided by 12 is 0.208333... So ln(0.20833) is negative because it's less than 1.

So plugging into the formula: ΔG = (2.25 mol) * (8.314 J/mol·K) * (325 K) * ln(2.5/12)

Wait, let me compute the ln part first. ln(2.5/12) = ln(5/24) ≈ ln(0.208333). I remember that ln(0.5) is about -0.6931. Since 0.2083 is less than 0.5, the ln will be more negative. Let me think, ln(0.2) is about -1.6094, and 0.2083 is a bit higher than 0.2, so maybe around -1.57 or so. Let me double-check using a calculator approach.

Alternatively, I can compute it exactly. So 2.5/12 is 5/24. Let me calculate ln(5/24):

Using a calculator, ln(5) is about 1.6094, ln(24) is about 3.1781. So ln(5/24) = ln(5) - ln(24) = 1.6094 - 3.1781 = -1.5687.

So the ln term is approximately -1.5687.

Now compute the rest. Let's compute each part step by step.

nRT is 2.25 * 8.314 * 325. Let's compute that.

First, 2.25 * 8.314. Let's see, 2 * 8.314 is 16.628, and 0.25 *8.314 is about 2.0785. So total is 16.628 + 2.0785 = 18.7065.

Then multiply by 325 K. 18.7065 * 325.

Let me compute 18.7065 * 300 = 5611.95, 18.7065 *25=467.6625. Adding those gives 5611.95 + 467.6625 = 6079.6125.

So nRT is approximately 6079.61 J.

Wait, wait. Let me recalculate that because 2.25 *8.314 is:

2.25 *8 = 18, 2.25 *0.314=0.7065. So 18 + 0.7065 = 18.7065. Correct.

Then 18.7065 *325.

Let me break it down again. 325 is 300 +25.

18.7065 * 300 = 5611.95

18.7065 *25: Let's compute 18.7065 *20=374.13; 18.7065 *5=93.5325. So 374.13 +93.5325=467.6625.

Adding the two: 5611.95 +467.6625=6079.6125 J/mol?

Wait, no, R is in J/(mol·K), so the entire nRT is in J.

So nRT is 6079.61 J.

Now multiply this by the ln value (-1.5687):

6079.61 J * (-1.5687) = ?

Let me compute that. 

First, 6079.61 *1.5687.

Wait, 6079.61 * 1 = 6079.61

6079.61 * 0.5 = 3039.805

6079.61 *0.0687 = let's compute 6079.61 *0.06= 364.7766; 6079.61 *0.0087= approx 52.841.

So 364.7766 +52.841 ≈417.6176.

So 6079.61 +3039.805 = 9119.415; plus 417.6176 is 9537.0326.

Wait, wait, maybe a better approach is to compute 6079.61 * 1.5687.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a calculator-like approach.

But for the sake of time, let me just do it approximately.

So 1.5687 is approximately 1.57.

6079.61 * 1.57.

Compute 6079.61 *1 =6079.61

6079.61 *0.5=3039.805

6079.61 *0.07=425.573

Add them up: 6079.61 +3039.805 =9119.415; plus 425.573 gives 9544.988.

So approximately 9545 J.

But since the ln term was negative, the result is -9545 J.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the exact multiplication.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 6079.6125 * (-1.5687) directly.

6079.6125 * (-1.5687) = ?

6079.6125 *1.5687:

Compute 6079.6125 * 1 =6079.6125

6079.6125 *0.5=3039.80625

6079.6125 *0.06=364.77675

6079.6125 *0.009=54.716611

6079.6125 *0.0007=4.25582875

Wait, perhaps this is getting too detailed. Alternatively, using a calculator would be better, but since I can't, I'll proceed.

So, adding those:

6079.6125 (from 1)
+3039.80625 (0.5) → total 9119.41875
+364.77675 (0.06) → 9484.1955
+54.716611 (0.009) →9538.9121
+4.25582875 (0.0007) →9543.1679 J.

So approximately 9543 J. But since the ln is -1.5687, the product is -9543 J.

Wait, but wait, the exact calculation is needed here. Alternatively, maybe I can compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps use 1.5687 *6079.6125.

Let me do it step by step.

Compute 6079.6125 * 1.5687.

First, 6079.6125 * 1 = 6079.6125

6079.6125 * 0.5 = 3039.80625

6079.6125 * 0.06 = 364.77675

6079.6125 * 0.009 = 54.716625

6079.6125 *0.0007 = 4.25582875

So adding all these:

6079.6125 +3039.80625 =9119.41875

9119.41875 +364.77675 =9484.1955

9484.1955 +54.716625 =9538.912125

9538.912125 +4.25582875 =9543.16795375 J.

So the product is approximately 9543.17 J. But since the ln is negative, the ΔG is -9543 J.

Wait, but wait—did I multiply by the correct sign? Yes, the ln is negative, so ΔG is negative.

So ΔG ≈ -9543 J. But wait, that's about -9.5 x10^3 J.

Looking at the options, the choices are:

A: -7.89e3

B: -12.75e3

C: -8.01e3

D: -10.02e3

E: -11.32e3

F: -5.89e3

G: -6.47e3

H: -9.54e3

I: -10.76e3

J: -8.23e3

So option H is -9.54e3 J. But wait, my calculation got approximately -9.54e3, which matches option H.

Wait, but let me recheck the calculations. Because sometimes I might have made a mistake in the formula or the computation.

Wait, the formula: for an isothermal process, the change in Gibbs free energy is given by ΔG = nRT ln(P_final / P_initial). Is that correct?

Yes, because for Gibbs free energy, at constant temperature, the change is ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1). But wait, another thought: when a gas expands, the system is doing work, so the process is spontaneous if ΔG is negative.

In this case, since P_final < P_initial, so ln(P2/P1) is negative, making ΔG negative, which aligns with the options provided.

Wait, but another point: sometimes, the formula is written as ΔG = nRT ln(P1/P2) when considering the process as expansion. Wait, no—ΔG is for the process as written, so if it's going from P1 to P2, it's P2/P1 inside the ln.

Wait, let me think again: when the process is expansion, the pressure decreases, so P2 < P1. So P2/P1 is less than 1, so ln of that is negative, leading to a negative ΔG, which is correct.

So the formula is correct as I applied it.

Wait, but in some sources, I've seen ΔG for expansion calculated using the formula ΔG = nRT ln(P_initial / P_final). Wait, that would give the opposite sign. So I need to make sure which one it is.

Wait, the correct formula is ΔG = nRT ln(P_final / P_initial), because ΔG is calculated as the change from initial to final state. So, if P_final < P_initial, the ln is negative, leading to negative ΔG.

Wait, but another approach: considering that for Gibbs free energy, the formula can also be expressed in terms of the reaction quotient Q. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, using the formula for ΔG when T is constant: ΔG = VΔP, but that's for incompressible substances, which isn't the case here. So, no, the correct formula for ideal gases is the one involving the ln of pressure ratio.

So, going back, I think I did the calculation correctly, and the result is approximately -9543 J, which is -9.54 x10^3 J. Looking at the options, that's option H.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me make sure about the value of R. If R is 8.314 J/(mol·K), then yes, it should be correct. But sometimes, when pressure is in bar, perhaps the value of R is different? Hmm, I think the value of R in J units is correct regardless of pressure units because the units inside the ln cancel out.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have used R as 8.314 J/(mol·K), which I did, so that's correct.

Wait, but in some textbooks, the formula for ΔG when pressure changes is ΔG = nRT ln(P2/P1). So yes, that's the formula I applied.

So, I think option H is the correct answer.
</think>

To calculate the change in Gibbs free energy (ΔG) for the isothermal expansion of 2.25 moles of an ideal gas at 325 K, from an initial pressure of 12.0 bar to a final pressure of 2.5 bar, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta G = nRT \ln\left(\frac{P_{\text{final}}}{P_{\text{initial}}}\right)
\]

### Step 1: Identify the given values
- **Number of moles**: \( n = 2.25 \, \text{mol} \)
- **Temperature**: \( T = 325 \, \text{K} \)
- **Initial pressure**: \( P_{\text{initial}} = 12.0 \, \text{bar} \)
- **Final pressure**: \( P_{\text{final}} = 2.5 \, \text{bar} \)
- **Gas constant**: \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/(mol·K)} \)

### Step 2: Calculate the pressure ratio
\[
\frac{P_{\text{final}}}{P_{\text{initial}}} = \frac{2.5}{12.0} = 0.208333
\]

### Step 3: Compute the natural logarithm
\[
\ln\left(\frac{P_{\text{final}}}{P_{\text{initial}}}\right) = \ln(0.208333) \approx -1.5687
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( nRT \)
\[
nRT = (2.25)(8.314)(325)
\]
First, calculate \( 2.25 \times 8.314 \):
\[
2.25 \times 8.314 = 18.7065
\]
Then, multiply by 325:
\[
18.7065 \times 325 = 6079.61 \, \text{J}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate \( \Delta G \)
\[
\Delta G = (6079.61)(-1.5687) \approx -9543 \, \text{J}
\]

### Step 6: Match with the closest option
The calculated value of \( \Delta G \) is approximately \( -9.54 \times 10^3 \, \text{J} \), which corresponds to **option H**.

### Final Answer
H
