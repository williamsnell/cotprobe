Okay, so I have this question about cognitive assessments for a nonverbal adolescent. Hmm, let me think. I remember that when someone is nonverbal, it means they don't use much spoken language, maybe because of a disability or choice. So the test should probably not rely heavily on verbal instructions or responses.

Looking at the options, I need to find a measure that's suitable for adolescents and is nonverbal. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children–IV. I think this is the WISC-IV, which is for kids. It does have both verbal and performance sections, but I'm not sure if it's suitable for nonverbal individuals because some subtests might require language.

Option B: Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children–II. KABC-II. I remember it's designed for children and has some nonverbal sections, but again, it might not be entirely nonverbal.

Option C: Cognitive Assessment System–II. CAS-II. It focuses on different cognitive processes like planning and attention. Not sure if it's nonverbal enough.

Option D: Woodcock-Johnson IV Tests of Cognitive Abilities. The WJ IV has various tests, including some that are nonverbal, but I think it's more comprehensive and might include verbal parts too.

Option E: Differential Ability Scales–II. DAS-II. I think it's also for children and has both verbal and nonverbal components. Maybe not the best fit.

Option F: Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence–IV. That's for younger kids, so probably not appropriate for an adolescent.

Option G: Ravens Progressive Matrices. Oh, right! Ravens tests are known for being nonverbal. They use visual puzzles and matrices, so no reading or talking needed. That sounds perfect for a nonverbal person.

Option H: Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales–5. I believe this is a more general test that includes both verbal and nonverbal sections. It's used across ages but might not be entirely nonverbal.

Option I: Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale–IV. WAIS-IV is for adults, so an adolescent might not fit the age range, plus it includes verbal sections.

Option J: Leiter–R. The Leiter International Performance Scale is another nonverbal test, right? It uses pictures and doesn't require language. It's often used for people who are nonverbal or have hearing impairments.

Wait, so both G and J are nonverbal. Now I need to decide which is more appropriate for an adolescent. The Leiter-R is often used with children and maybe adolescents, but I'm not sure about the age range. Ravens Progressive Matrices are used across a wide age range, including adolescents and adults. Also, Ravens is known for being completely nonverbal and culture-fair.

So between G and J, which is better? The question asks for the most appropriate. Leiter-R might be for a younger crowd, whereas Ravens can be used with older individuals as well. So for an adolescent, Ravens (G) might be the better choice.

Alternatively, I should recall if Leiter-R is suitable for adolescents. The Leiter-R is designed for ages 2 through 20 or so. So maybe it's appropriate. Hmm, but I think the Ravens Progressive Matrices are often the go-to for nonverbal assessments, especially when you need a measure that's less dependent on cultural background or language.

Wait, but the options include J: Leiter-R. So which one is correct? I'm a bit confused now. Both G and J are nonverbal. Let me think about the structure.

Leiter-R uses a variety of visual tasks and is known for being nonverbal. It's often used with individuals who are deaf or have language impairments. Ravens also uses visual puzzles but is perhaps more commonly used in research settings. But in clinical settings, Leiter might be more standard for nonverbal assessments across ages, including adolescents.

Alternatively, the question is about the most appropriate. The Leiter-R is designed to be a nonverbal measure, so it's probably the best fit.

The question asks for the most appropriate measure of general cognitive abilities for a nonverbal adolescent. Nonverbal assessments are necessary when individuals cannot rely on spoken language, so the chosen test should minimize or eliminate verbal instructions and responses. 

- **Option A (WISC-IV)**: This test includes both verbal and performance sections, making it less suitable for nonverbal individuals.  
- **Option B (KABC-II)**: While it has nonverbal components, it is not entirely nonverbal.  
- **Option C (CAS-II)**: Focuses on cognitive processes but is not specifically designed as a nonverbal measure.  
- **Option D (WJ IV)**: A comprehensive test with some nonverbal sections, but it includes verbal components as well.  
- **Option E (DAS-II)**: Designed for children and includes both verbal and nonverbal sections, so not ideal for nonverbal adolescents.  
- **Option F (WPPSI-IV)**: Intended for younger children, not appropriate for adolescents.  
- **Option G (Ravens Progressive Matrices)**: A well-known nonverbal test using visual puzzles, suitable for a wide age range, including adolescents.  
- **Option H (Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales–5)**: Includes both verbal and nonverbal sections, so not entirely nonverbal.  
- **Option I (WAIS-IV)**: Designed for adults and includes verbal sections, making it unsuitable for nonverbal adolescents.  
- **Option J (Leiter–R)**: A nonverbal test designed for individuals with language impairments, suitable for ages 2 through 20, making it appropriate for adolescents.  

Both **G (Ravens Progressive Matrices)** and **J (Leiter–R)** are nonverbal tests. However, the Leiter–R is specifically designed for individuals with language impairments and is suitable for adolescents, making it the most appropriate choice.
