Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about humanistic psychotherapy and psychopathology. Hmm, I need to figure out what the answer is. Let me start by breaking down the question.

The question is asking about the cause of psychopathology according to practitioners of humanistic psychotherapy. The options are A through I, each giving a different possible cause. I remember that humanistic psychology focuses on personal growth, self-actualization, and the individual's potential. So, psychopathology would relate to something blocking that growth.

Let me think about each option. Option A is "blocked potential." That sounds right because humanistic approaches like Rogers' person-centered therapy emphasize the person's innate tendency towards self-actualization. If that's blocked, it could lead to issues.

Option B is severe trauma. I know trauma is more related to other approaches, maybe psychodynamic or cognitive-behavioral. Humanistic might acknowledge trauma but not as the primary cause.

Option C is genetic predisposition. That's more of a biological perspective, which doesn't fit with humanistic psychology's focus on the person's experience and environment.

Option D, cognitive distortions, is from cognitive-behavioral therapy. That's about negative thought patterns, not really the humanistic view.

Option E is lack of emotional intelligence. I'm not sure if that's a key concept here. Emotional intelligence is more of a separate concept, though it might be touched on in some therapies.

Option F is unresolved conflicts. That's more from psychoanalysis, like Freudian theory, which deals with unconscious conflicts.

Option G is chemical imbalances, which is the medical model, not humanistic.

Option H is suppressed memories. Again, that's more psychodynamic, like repression in Freud's theories.

Option I is improper socialization. That's from behaviorist or sociological perspectives, maybe. Humanistic might consider the social environment but not as the main cause.

So putting it all together, the humanistic view sees psychopathology as resulting from blocked potential, which prevents self-actualization. So the answer should be A: blocked potential.

The humanistic approach to psychotherapy emphasizes personal growth, self-actualization, and the individual's innate potential. Psychopathology, from this perspective, arises when this potential is blocked, hindering the individual's ability to grow and fulfill their true self. Among the options provided, "blocked potential" aligns most closely with this understanding.

Answer: A
