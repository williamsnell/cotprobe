Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

According to usual practice, a long-time regular customer left her car at an auto mechanic's shop with written instructions to "check and tune up the engine; make sure the brakes are good and working; examine the tires; also, check and repair all major systems because I am driving cross country next week." She did not see the mechanic or discuss with him the price or other details. When she picked up the car, there was a bill for $5,000 on the dash board. All of the services and parts were workmanlike, not defective and pertained to the areas in the instructions. She refused to pay, claiming that there was no agreement and that the mechanic should have called for advance approval. Can she be held responsible for contractual services performed?

Options:

A: No, because there is always an implication that the provider must get permission before doing work not approved.
B: No, because there was no written agreement specifying the cost of the services.
C: Yes, because she left written instructions, which can be considered a contract.
D: Yes, because she had a history of leaving her car for service without discussing price or details.
E: Yes, because the circumstances, including prior practice, showed intent to contract and a meeting of the minds.
F: No, because a contract cannot be based on implications and guess work.
G: Yes, because the circumstances and past practice established an implied-in-law contract based on mutual assent.
H: No, because the mechanic did not provide an estimate before performing the services.
I: No, because she did not explicitly agree to the price of the services.
J: Yes, because the quality of the work was satisfactory and pertained to the areas in the instructions.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this contract law question. Let me read through it again carefully.

Alright, the situation is that a long-time regular customer left her car at a mechanic's shop with specific written instructions. She told them to check and tune up the engine, make sure the brakes are good, examine the tires, and check and repair all major systems because she's driving cross country. She didn't discuss the price or other details with the mechanic. When she picked up the car, there was a $5,000 bill, and she refused to pay, saying there was no agreement and that the mechanic should have called for advance approval.

The question is whether she can be held responsible for the bill based on contractual services performed.

So, the key issues here are about contract formation. Did the parties have a binding contract? If so, she would be liable to pay.

From what I remember, a contract requires offer, acceptance, consideration, and mutual intent to be bound (meeting of the minds). Sometimes, contracts can be implied, especially when there's a course of dealing or prior practice.

In this case, she's a long-time regular customer. That suggests that there's been prior dealings where she's left her car for service without discussing prices each time. So perhaps there's an implied agreement based on past practice.

She gave written instructions, which could be seen as an offer. The mechanic, by performing the services, accepted that offer. The consideration would be the services rendered in exchange for payment.

I think about whether there was an agreement on the price. Usually, if you take your car to a mechanic and they do work without your explicit approval, they can still charge you based on the reasonable value of the services. But sometimes, for significant repairs, the law requires that the mechanic get authorization, especially if the costs are high.

Wait, but in this case, the customer was a regular, and maybe they had a history of the mechanic doing work without prior approval. If that's the case, then there might be an implied agreement that the mechanic can perform these services and bill her accordingly.

Looking at the options:

Option A says no because there's always an implication that the provider must get permission. But I don't think that's always the case. It depends on the circumstances, like prior dealings. So A might not be correct.

Option B says no because there was no written agreement on cost. But contracts don't always have to be written, especially for services. So B might not be the right answer.

Option C says yes because the written instructions are a contract. Well, written instructions can be part of an offer, but the acceptance is the doing of the work. So C might be partially correct but maybe not the full reason.

Option D says yes because of the history of leaving the car without discussing price. That sounds like it's pointing to implied agreement based on prior dealings. That makes sense.

Option E says yes because circumstances and prior practice show intent and meeting of minds. That sounds right because both parties knew the expectations from previous interactions.

Option F says no because contracts can't be based on implications. But that's not true; implied contracts are a thing. So F is incorrect.

Option G says yes because it's an implied-in-law contract. Wait, implied-in-law (quasi-contracts) are about unjust enrichment, not mutual assent. So G might not be the right reason because there was mutual assent here.

Option H says no because no estimate was given. But again, if there's a prior course of dealing, maybe estimates weren't required. So H might not apply.

Option I says no because she didn't agree to the price. But perhaps the price is reasonable, and with prior dealings, she's bound to pay the reasonable cost.

Option J says yes because the work was satisfactory. But that's about the quality, not the agreement to pay. So J isn't the main reason.

So, the best options seem to be D and E. D focuses on the history, while E is more about the circumstances showing mutual intent.

I think the correct answer would be E because it's about the mutual intent and meeting of the minds based on prior practice. The customer's past behavior of leaving the car and accepting the bills without discussion implies that she agreed to pay for the services rendered, even if the exact price wasn't discussed each time.

Alternatively, D is also a possible answer because it's about the history of not discussing prices. But E seems broader, encompassing the circumstances and prior practice as showing mutual intent.

Wait, but in contract law, for an implied-in-fact contract, you look at the parties' conduct and prior dealings. So E is talking about mutual assent and meeting of the minds, which fits implied-in-fact.

So the answer should be E.

The question revolves around whether a long-time regular customer can be held responsible for a $5,000 bill after the mechanic performed services based on her written instructions. The key issue is whether a contract was formed, which requires mutual assent, offer, acceptance, and consideration.

The customer provided written instructions, which can be seen as an offer. The mechanic, by performing the services, accepted the offer. The consideration is the services rendered in exchange for payment. The critical factor is whether there was mutual intent to be bound, which can be implied through the circumstances and prior dealings. The customer's history of leaving her car for service without discussing prices suggests a course of dealing, implying an agreement that the mechanic could perform work and bill her accordingly. This points to an implied-in-fact contract based on mutual assent and prior practice.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, F, H, I, J**: These options are incorrect because they either ignore the role of implied contracts, prior dealings, or focus on irrelevant factors like the quality of work or written agreements on cost.
- **C, D, G**: While partially relevant, they do not fully capture the mutual intent and meeting of the minds based on circumstances and prior practice.
- **E**: Correct, as it accurately reflects the mutual intent and meeting of the minds derived from the circumstances and prior practice, forming an implied-in-fact contract.

Thus, the customer can be held responsible for the bill based on the implied contract formed through her actions and prior dealings.

Answer: E
