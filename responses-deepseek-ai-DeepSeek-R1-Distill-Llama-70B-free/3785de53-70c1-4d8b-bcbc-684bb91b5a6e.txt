Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. William Accra's company output is increasing each week, and the output is given by this function F(t) which equals -10,000 plus 50 times t to the fourth power. The question is asking how many weeks it will take for them to reach an output of 190,000. Hmm, okay.

So, the function is F(t) = -10,000 + 50t^4. They want to find the value of t when F(t) equals 190,000. So I need to set up the equation 190,000 = -10,000 + 50t^4 and solve for t.

Wait, let me make sure I get that right. So F(t) is 190,000. So:

190,000 = -10,000 + 50t^4.

I think the first step is to isolate the term with t. So I'll add 10,000 to both sides to get rid of the negative. Let's do that:

190,000 + 10,000 = 50t^4.

That gives 200,000 = 50t^4.

Now, I can divide both sides by 50 to solve for t^4. So:

200,000 / 50 = t^4.

Calculating that, 200,000 divided by 50 is 4,000. So now I have:

t^4 = 4,000.

Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check that division. 50 times 4 is 200, so 200,000 divided by 50 is 4,000. Yeah, that's correct.

So t^4 equals 4,000. Now I need to solve for t. Since it's t to the fourth power, I should take the fourth root of both sides. Alternatively, I can take the square root twice, but the fourth root is more straightforward.

So t equals the fourth root of 4,000. Hmm, what's the fourth root of 4,000?

Wait, maybe I can express 4,000 as a power that's easier to handle. Let's see. 4,000 is 4 x 1,000. 1,000 is 10^3. So 4,000 is 4 * 10^3, which is 2^2 * (2*5)^3. Let me think about that.

Alternatively, I can think about 4,000 as 10^3 * 4 = 10^3 * 2^2. So when I take the fourth root, I can break it down into exponents.

The fourth root of 4,000 is the same as 4,000^(1/4). Let's write 4,000 as 2^2 * (2*5)^3. Hmm, maybe that's getting complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I should just compute it numerically.

Wait, let me try plugging in some numbers to approximate. Let's see, 10^4 is 10,000, which is bigger than 4,000. So t must be less than 10. Let's try t=8. 8^4 is 4096. That's just a bit more than 4,000. So t is a little less than 8.

Wait, but 8^4 is 4096, which is very close to 4,000. So perhaps t is approximately 8 weeks. But wait, let me check the options. The options are A:10, B:14, C:13, D:9, etc. H is 8, so that's an option.

Wait, but wait. Let me calculate 8^4 again. 8 squared is 64. 8^3 is 512. 8^4 is 4096. So 4096 is more than 4000. So 8^4 is 4096. So if t^4 is 4000, then t would be a little less than 8, maybe around 7.9 weeks or something. But the options don't have 8 as the correct answer? Wait, wait, let me check the options again.

Looking back, the options are:

A:10, B:14, C:13, D:9, E:7, F:6, G:12, H:8, I:5, J:11.

So option H is 8 weeks. But let me see, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let's go back step by step. The equation is 190,000 = -10,000 +50t^4.

Adding 10,000: 200,000 =50t^4.

Divide by 50: 4,000 = t^4.

So t^4=4,000. So t is the fourth root of 4,000.

Wait, maybe I can compute 4,000^(1/4) more accurately.

I remember that 10^4 is 10,000, which is larger than 4,000. So smaller than 10.

Let me try 8: 8^4=4096, as before. That's just a bit over 4,000.

What about 7.9? Let's compute 7.9^4.

Wait, maybe it's easier to compute 7.9^2 first, then square that.

7.9^2 = (8 - 0.1)^2 = 64 - 2*8*0.1 + 0.1^2 = 64 - 1.6 + 0.01 = 62.41.

Then, 7.9^4 = (7.9^2)^2 = (62.41)^2.

Compute 62.41 squared:

62 *62 = 3844.

0.41^2=0.1681.

But wait, more accurately, 62.41 *62.41:

Let me do it step by step.

62.41 *62.41 = ?

Well, (62 + 0.41)^2 = 62^2 + 2*62*0.41 + 0.41^2.

62^2 is 3844.

2*62*0.41 = 124 * 0.41. Let's compute 124 *0.4 =49.6, 124*0.01=1.24. So 49.6+1.24=50.84.

0.41^2=0.1681.

So adding them up: 3844 +50.84 =3894.84 +0.1681=3894.84 +0.1681=3895.0081.

So 7.9^4 is approximately 3895, which is less than 4,000.

Wait, but 8^4 is 4096, which is more than 4,000. So t is between 7.9 and 8.

Wait, but 7.9^4 is 3895, which is below 4,000. So the required t is between 7.9 and 8.

But the options are in whole numbers, so 8 weeks would give t^4=4096, which is 50*4096=204,800. So F(t)= -10,000 +204,800=194,800.

Wait, but the target is 190,000, which is less than 194,800. So at 8 weeks, output is 194,800, which is higher than 190,000. But the question is, how many weeks to reach 190,000. So perhaps it's a bit less than 8 weeks. But the options given are all whole numbers. So the closest whole number would be 8 weeks, but let me check the options again.

Wait, the options include H as 8. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's solve t^4=4000.

So t = (4000)^(1/4).

We can write 4000 as 10^3.8…? Wait, perhaps using logarithms.

Take the natural log of both sides: ln(t^4)=ln(4000).

So 4 ln t = ln(4000).

Then ln t = (ln 4000)/4.

Compute ln(4000). Hmm, I know that ln(1000)=6.9078 (since e^6.9078≈1000).

So ln(4000)=ln(4*1000)=ln4 + ln1000≈1.3863 +6.9078≈8.2941.

So 4 ln t ≈8.2941 → ln t≈8.2941/4≈2.0735.

Then t= e^2.0735 ≈e^2 is about 7.389, e^0.0735 is approximately 1.0765. So 7.389 * 1.0765 ≈7.95.

So t≈7.95 weeks, which is about 8 weeks. But since the options are in whole weeks, the output reaches 190,000 during the 8th week, but not exactly at 8 weeks. Wait, but perhaps the question expects an exact integer, so maybe I should check if 8^4 is 4096, leading to F(t)=50*4096-10,000=204,800-10,000=194,800, which is higher than 190,000.

Wait, but perhaps I made an error in the initial equation setup. Let me check again.

The problem states F(t) = -10,000 +50t^4.

We set F(t)=190,000:

190,000 = -10,000 +50t^4.

Adding 10,000: 200,000 =50t^4.

Divide by 50: 4,000 =t^4.

So t= (4000)^(1/4).

But perhaps there's a better way to compute this without a calculator. Let me think about it.

I know that 10^4=10,000. So 4000 is less than that, so t is less than 10. Let's try 8 again: 8^4=4096, which is more than 4000. So t is a little less than 8, like 7.95 weeks.

But the options only have whole numbers, so the closest is 8 weeks, but the output at 8 weeks is 194,800, which is more than 190,000. So perhaps the correct answer is 8 weeks, as the time when output exceeds 190,000.

Wait, but the question is asking for when they reach 190,000. So if at 8 weeks they are at 194,800, that's after passing 190,000. So perhaps the exact time is before 8 weeks, but the options don't have fractional weeks. So maybe the answer is 8 weeks.

Wait, but looking at the options, H is 8, which is one of the choices. So perhaps the correct answer is H:8 weeks.

Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I can try t=7. Let's compute 7^4: 7^2=49, 7^4=49^2=2401.

So 50*2401=120,050. Then F(t)=120,050 -10,000=110,050, which is way less than 190,000. So t=7 is too low.

t=8: F(t)=50*(4096) -10,000=204,800-10,000=194,800.

So 194,800 is higher than 190,000. So the output reaches 190,000 somewhere between t=7 and t=8.

But the options don't have fractions. So perhaps the correct answer is 8 weeks, as that's when the output surpasses 190,000.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe I should have moved the -10,000 to the other side correctly. Let me recheck:

190,000 = -10,000 +50 t^4.

Add 10,000 to both sides: 200,000 =50 t^4.

Yes, that's correct. So t^4=4,000.

So t is the fourth root of 4,000, which is approximately 7.95, as I calculated before.

So since 7.95 is about 8 weeks, but perhaps the exact value is a whole number. Let me see if 8 is the correct option.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of 4,000 as 10^3.8 or something, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another approach: 4,000 = 16 * 250. 16 is 2^4, and 250 is 5^3 * 2. Hmm, perhaps not helpful.

Alternatively, 4,000 = 2^5 * 5^3. Because 2^5 is 32, and 5^3 is 125. 32 * 125 = 4,000.

So 4,000 =2^5 *5^3.

So t^4=2^5 *5^3.

So t= (2^5 *5^3)^(1/4)= 2^(5/4)*5^(3/4).

Hmm, that's probably not helpful for exact computation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of t as a multiple of some number. Let me think, 4,000 is 8*500. 8 is 2^3, 500 is 5^3 *2^2.

Hmm, perhaps not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can think of 4,000 as (5^4)*something. 5^4 is 625, which is less than 4,000. 4,000 /625 is 6.4.

So 4,000=625 *6.4=5^4 * (16*0.4)=5^4*(2^4 *0.4).

Wait, perhaps that's getting me nowhere.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of 4,000 as 10^3.8, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 4,000^(1/4) numerically with more precision.

Let me try a better approximation.

I know that 8^4=4096, which is 96 more than 4000.

So let me find x where (8 - x)^4 =4000.

We can do a linear approximation.

Let me let f(x) = (8 -x)^4.

We know that f(0)=4096.

We need to find x such that f(x)=4000.

So 4096 - f'(0)*x ≈4000.

Compute f'(x)=4*(8 -x)^3*(-1). So f'(0)= -4*(8^3)= -4*512= -2048.

So using the linear approximation:

4000 ≈4096 -2048*x.

So 4096 -2048x =4000.

Subtract 4000: 96=2048x → x=96/2048= 0.046875.

So x≈0.0469.

So (8 -0.0469)=7.9531 weeks.

So approximately 7.95 weeks. So about 7 weeks and 4 days (since 0.95 of a week is about 6.7 days, roughly 6 days and 17 hours).

But the options are in whole weeks, so 8 weeks would be the next whole week after 7.95. So the answer would be 8 weeks, which is option H.

Wait, but perhaps the question expects an exact answer, but since 4000 isn't a perfect fourth power, maybe I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe there's a trick I'm missing. Let's see:

t^4=4000.

Wait, 4000 can be written as 10^3 *4, so 4*10^3.

Hmm, 4 is 2^2, 10^3 is (2*5)^3=2^3*5^3. So overall, 4*10^3=2^2 *2^3 *5^3=2^5 *5^3.

So t^4=2^5 *5^3.

So t= (2^5 *5^3)^(1/4)=2^(5/4) *5^(3/4).

Which is 2^(1.25) *5^(0.75).

Hmm, but that doesn't help much without a calculator.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a better way. Wait, maybe I can express 4000 as 16*250, and 250 as 5^3*2, so 16=2^4. So 4000=2^4 *5^3 *2=2^5 *5^3.

Wait, same as before.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write 4000 as (5^(3/4))^4 * (2^(5/4))^4, but I'm not sure.

Well, perhaps it's easier to stick with the approximation. So t≈7.95 weeks, which is approximately 8 weeks. So the correct answer would be 8 weeks, which is option H.
</think>

To determine how many weeks it will take for the company's output to reach 190,000, we start with the given function:

\[
F(t) = -10,000 + 50t^4
\]

We set \( F(t) = 190,000 \) and solve for \( t \):

\[
190,000 = -10,000 + 50t^4
\]

First, add 10,000 to both sides:

\[
200,000 = 50t^4
\]

Next, divide by 50:

\[
t^4 = 4,000
\]

To solve for \( t \), take the fourth root of both sides:

\[
t = \sqrt[4]{4,000}
\]

Approximating \( \sqrt[4]{4,000} \), we know:

- \( 8^4 = 4096 \), which is slightly greater than 4,000.
- \( 7^4 = 2,401 \), which is much less than 4,000.

Thus, \( t \) is between 7 and 8. To refine further, note that \( 8^4 = 4,096 \), which is 96 more than 4,000. Using linear approximation, \( t \approx 7.95 \) weeks. Since the options are in whole numbers, the closest value is \( t = 8 \).

At \( t = 8 \), the output is:

\[
F(8) = -10,000 + 50(8^4) = -
