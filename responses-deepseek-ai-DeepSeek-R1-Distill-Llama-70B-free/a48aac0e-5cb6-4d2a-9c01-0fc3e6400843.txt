Okay, so I have this question about the Boltzmann constant, and I'm a bit rusty on my physics, but I'll try to think it through. I remember that the Boltzmann constant is a fundamental constant in physics, especially in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics.

Wait, the Boltzmann constant, k, relates the thermal energy to temperature. I think it's used in equations like the ideal gas law on a microscopic scale. Oh right, the equation is something like PV = nkT, but wait, that's when n is the number of moles. Oh wait, another equation comes to mind: the average translational kinetic energy is (3/2)kT per molecule. That equation might help me figure out the units.

So, the kinetic energy is in joules, right? And temperature is in Kelvin. So the unit for k must be J/(K·particle). But wait, let's break down the units.

Joule is kg·m²/s². So the unit for k should be (kg·m²/s²) / (K), so kg·m²/(s²·K). Let me write that down: kg m² s^-2 K^-1.

Now, looking at the options, each option has a number and then units. The value I remember for Boltzmann's constant is approximately 1.38 times 10^-23. So the options with 1.38e-23 are A, E, F, G (wait, G is 1.39e-23, so close but probably wrong), and others have different exponents.

Looking at the units:

Option A: m^3·kg·s^-3·K^-1. That would be kg m³/s³ K. Doesn't match what I thought.

Option E: m²·kg·s^-2·K^-1. Oh, that's exactly what I was thinking: kg m²/(s² K). So that's a candidate.

Option F: kg m² s^-3 K^-1. Wait, the exponent on s is -3, but I thought it was -2. Because kinetic energy is kg m²/s², so dividing by K gives kg m²/(s² K), so the s would be squared in the denominator, so s^-2. So F has s^-3, which doesn't fit.

Option G is 1.39e-23, which is a bit off from the standard 1.38 value I remember, so probably not the right choice.

Now, looking back, E and F are close. E's units are m² kg s^-2 K^-1. F's is kg m² s^-3 K^-1. So E's unit matches.

Wait, another way: The Boltzmann constant has units of J/(K), where J is energy. So J is kg m²/s², so J/K is (kg m²/s²)/K = kg m²/(s² K). Which matches E's units.

So the correct value should be 1.38e-23 and the units as in E.

Wait, let me check the exponent again. The options: E is 1.38e-23 with units m^2 kg s^-2 K^-1. Yes, that's right.

So the correct answer should be option E.

The Boltzmann constant, \( k \), is a fundamental constant in physics that relates thermal energy to temperature. Its value is approximately \( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \) and its units are derived from the relationship between energy (in joules, \( \text{J} = \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2 \cdot \text{s}^{-2} \)) and temperature (in kelvin, \( \text{K} \)). Specifically, the units of \( k \) are \( \text{J}/\text{K} \), which simplify to \( \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2 \cdot \text{s}^{-2} \cdot \text{K}^{-1} \).

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: The units are \( \text{m}^3 \cdot \text{kg} \cdot \text{s}^{-3} \cdot \text{K}^{-1} \), which do not match the required units.
- **Option E**: The units are \( \text{m}^2 \cdot \text{kg} \cdot \text{s}^{-2} \cdot \text{K}^{-1} \), which match the derived units of \( k \).
- **Option F**: The units are \( \text{kg} \cdot \text{m}^2 \cdot \text{s}^{-3} \cdot \text{K}^{-1} \), which have an incorrect exponent for seconds.
- **Option G**: While the units match, the value \( 1.39 \times 10^{-23} \) is slightly off from the standard \( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \).

Thus, the correct choice is **Option E**, as it has the correct value and units for the Boltzmann constant.
