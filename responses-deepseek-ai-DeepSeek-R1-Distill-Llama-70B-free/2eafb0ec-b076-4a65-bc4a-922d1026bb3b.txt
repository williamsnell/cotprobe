Okay, so I've got this problem about a comet moving in a parabolic orbit in the same plane as Earth's orbit. The question is asking me to find out how many days the comet spends within Earth's orbit when it approaches the Sun as close as Mercury's perihelion. The given formula is a bit complicated, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, I recall that Earth's orbit is circular with radius r_E, and the comet's closest approach (perihelion) is β times r_E, where β is less than 1. The formula provided is √[2(1-β)] * (1 + 2β) / (3π) multiplied by 1 year. So, my goal is to plug in the value of β corresponding to Mercury's perihelion and calculate the time.

Wait, what's Mercury's perihelion distance? I think Mercury's orbit is elliptical. I remember that Mercury's average distance from the Sun is about 0.387 AU, but the perihelion is closer. Oh right, Mercury's perihelion is approximately 0.307 AU. Since Earth's average distance is 1 AU, that would make β equal to 0.307. So β = 0.307.

Now, substituting β into the formula: √[2(1 - β)] * (1 + 2β) / (3π). Let's compute each part step by step.

First, compute 1 - β: 1 - 0.307 = 0.693.

Multiply that by 2: 2 * 0.693 = 1.386.

Take the square root of that: √1.386 ≈ 1.177.

Next, compute 1 + 2β: 1 + 2 * 0.307 = 1 + 0.614 = 1.614.

Now multiply these two results: 1.177 * 1.614 ≈ let's see, 1.2 * 1.6 is about 1.92, but more accurately: 1.177 * 1.614.

1.177 * 1.6 = 1.8832, and 1.177 * 0.014 = ~0.0165. So total ≈ 1.8832 + 0.0165 = 1.8997, approximately 1.9.

Then divide by 3π: 1.9 / (3 * 3.1416) ≈ 1.9 / 9.4248 ≈ 0.2017.

So the entire thing is 0.2017 times 1 year. Since 1 year is 365 days, multiply 0.2017 by 365 to get the time in days.

0.2017 * 365 ≈ let's compute 0.2 * 365 = 73 days. 0.0017 * 365 ≈ 0.6205. So total ≈73.62 days. That's approximately 74 days.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see exactly 74. The closest is option H:76 days, or option B:72, G:64, etc. Hmm. Maybe I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately. Let me recheck each step.

First, β = 0.307.

Compute 1 - β = 0.693. 2*(1-β) = 1.386. sqrt(1.386) is approximately 1.177, correct.

1 + 2β = 1 + 0.614 = 1.614, correct.

Multiply 1.177 * 1.614: let's compute it precisely.

1.177 × 1.614:

1 * 1.614 = 1.614
0.177 × 1.614: Let's compute 0.1*1.614=0.1614; 0.07*1.614≈0.113; 0.007*1.614≈0.011298. Adding those: 0.1614 + 0.113=0.2744 +0.011298≈0.2857.

So total 1.614 + 0.2857=1.8997, as before.

Divide by 3π: 1.8997 / (3 * π) ≈ 1.8997 /9.4248 ≈ 0.2017.

Multiply by 365: 0.2017 *365.

Let me compute 0.2 *365 =73 days.

0.0017 *365 = approx 0.6205 days. So total is 73.6205 days. Rounded to about 74 days.

Looking at the options, the closest is option H:76 days, but wait, perhaps I miscalculated the initial steps. Alternatively, maybe the approach is wrong.

Wait, the initial assumption was that β is 0.307, which is correct for Mercury's perihelion. But perhaps I should use more precise values.

Wait, perhaps I should compute using more accurate numbers. Let me double-check the value of β.

According to NASA, Mercury's perihelion is about 46 million km, and Earth's average distance is about 150 million km. So 46/150 = approx 0.3067, which is about 0.307 as I had.

Another possibility: perhaps the formula provided in the question is an approximation. Let me re-examine the formula.

The time is given by sqrt(2(1-β)) * (1 + 2β) / (3π) times 1 year.

Wait, let me plug β=0.307 into this expression.

Calculate each term:

sqrt(2(1 - β)) = sqrt(2 * 0.693) = sqrt(1.386) ≈ 1.1769.

(1 + 2β) = 1 + 0.614 = 1.614.

Multiply them: 1.1769 * 1.614 ≈ let's compute exactly:

1.1769 * 1.6 = 1.883 (since 1.1769 * 1.6 = 1.88294)
1.1769 * 0.014 = 0.016487
Total is 1.88294 + 0.016487 = 1.899427.

Now, 1.899427 / (3π) = 1.899427 / 9.424777 ≈ 0.2016.

0.2016 * 365 = let's compute 0.2016 * 365.

0.2 *365=73, 0.0016 *365=0.584. So total 73.584 days. Approximately 73.6 days.

Hmm, but none of the options are exactly 73 or 74. The closest is option H:76 days, but that's a couple of days off. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula's interpretation.

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the formula correctly. Let me re-express the formula:

The time is [sqrt(2(1-β)) * (1 + 2β) ] / (3π) multiplied by 1 year.

Wait, but perhaps the formula is:

sqrt[2(1-beta)] multiplied by (1 + 2 beta) divided by (3 pi), then multiplied by 1 year.

Yes, that's correct. So perhaps I should think about the calculation again.

Alternatively, maybe the approach should involve solving Kepler's equation for the time within Earth's orbit. Wait, but the given formula is supposed to give the time directly.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is derived from integrating the comet's path within Earth's orbit. But since the formula is provided, I'll proceed with that.

Wait, maybe I should compute the expression more accurately.

Let me compute each term in precise steps.

First, compute 2*(1 - β) = 2*(1 - 0.307) = 2*0.693=1.386.

sqrt(1.386) = sqrt(1.386). Let me compute it more accurately.

I know that 1.18^2 = 1.3924. Oh wait, 1.18^2 is 1.3924, which is slightly higher than 1.386. So sqrt(1.386) is approximately 1.176.

Wait, let's compute 1.176^2: 1.176 *1.176.

1 *1 =1, 1*.176*2= 0.352, .176^2=0.030976. So 1 + 0.352 + 0.030976=1.382976. That's less than 1.386.

So 1.176^2=1.382976.

1.386 -1.382976=0.003024. So the difference is 0.003024.

Each increment of 0.001 in the square root adds approximately 2*1.176 *0.001 + (0.001)^2 = 0.002352 + 0.000001=0.002353 to the square.

We need 0.003024. So 0.003024 / 0.002353 ≈1.285. So about 0.001285 increments.

So sqrt(1.386) ≈1.176 + 0.001285 =1.177285.

So approximately 1.1773.

Now, 1.1773 * 1.614.

Let me compute 1.1773 *1.614:

Calculate 1 *1.614 =1.614.

0.1773*1.614:

Compute 0.1*1.614=0.1614.

0.07*1.614=0.113 (approx 0.11298).

0.0073*1.614≈0.01178.

Adding them together: 0.1614 + 0.11298=0.27438 +0.01178=0.28616.

So total 1.614 +0.28616=1.90016.

So 1.90016 divided by 3π.

3π is approximately9.42477796.

1.90016 / 9.42477796 ≈0.2016.

Multiply by 365: 0.2016 *365 = let's compute.

0.2 *365=73.

0.0016 *365=0.584.

So total 73.584 days, which is about 73.58 days, roughly 74 days.

But the options don't have 74. Hmm. Let me check the options again: the options are A:82, B:72, C:90, D:110, E:45, F:85, G:64, H:76, I:100.

Wait, option B is 72, which is about 1.5 days less than 73.58. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the multiplication.

Wait, 1.90016 /9.42477796: let's compute it more accurately.

Let me compute 1.90016 ÷ 9.42477796.

Hmm, 9.42477796 × 0.2016 = 1.899. Wait, but 9.42477796 × 0.2016=?

Let me compute 9.42477796 * 0.2 =1.884955592.

9.42477796 *0.0016=0.015079244.

Adding: 1.884955592 +0.015079244=1.900034836, which is very close to 1.90016.

So 9.42477796 × 0.2016 ≈1.9000348. So 1.90016 is a tiny bit higher, so 0.2016 + (0.00012536 /9.42477796).

Wait, 1.90016 -1.9000348=0.0001252.

So to find the additional x such that 9.42477796 * x =0.0001252.

x=0.0001252/9.42477796 ≈0.00001328.

So the total is 0.2016 + 0.00001328 ≈0.20161328.

Multiply by 365: 0.20161328 *365.

Compute 0.2 *365=73.

0.00161328 *365=0.588582.

So total 73 +0.588582=73.588582 days, about 73.59 days.

So approximately 74 days. But none of the options exactly match. The closest is option H:76, which is 2 days off. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is presented as sqrt(2(1-beta)} * (1 +2beta) / (3 pi), and then multiplied by 1 year. So I think my calculation is correct. But the options don't have 74, but option B is 72 and H is 76.

Wait, perhaps I should consider more precise values for β. Let me check Mercury's perihelion more accurately. Wait, perhaps I should look up exact data.

Quick online check: Mercury's perihelion is approximately 0.3075 AU. So β=0.3075.

Let me recompute with β=0.3075.

1 - β=0.6925.

2*(1-β)=1.385.

sqrt(1.385)= let's compute this accurately.

I know that 1.177^2=1.385929. Oh wait, so sqrt(1.385)=1.177 approximately.

Wait, 1.177^2=1.385929, which is higher than 1.385. So 1.177^2=1.385929.

Wait, but 1.385 is less than that. So sqrt(1.385) is less than 1.177.

Compute 1.176^2=1.382976, as before.

1.385 -1.382976=0.002024.

So each additional 0.001 in x adds about 0.00235*0.001=0.00000235 to x². Wait, no, better to compute the derivative.

The square root function's derivative is (1/(2√x)). At x=1.382976, which is (1.176)^2, so sqrt(x)=1.176. The derivative is 1/(2*1.176)= approx 0.4255.

So the change in x (dx) is approximately 0.002024. The change in sqrt(x) would be approximately 0.4255 * dx.

Wait, no, wait. The change in x is 0.002024. Wait, no, the square root increases by approximately derivative * dx.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let's compute 1.385.

We have 1.176^2=1.382976.

1.385 is 1.382976 + 0.002024.

So sqrt(1.385)=1.176 + (0.002024)/(2*1.176) )= 1.176 + 0.002024/(2.352)= approx 1.176 + 0.00086≈1.17686.

So sqrt(1.385)= approx 1.17686.

Now, compute 1 + 2β= 1 + 2*0.3075=1 + 0.615=1.615.

Multiply sqrt term and (1+2β): 1.17686 *1.615.

Compute 1.17686 *1.615.

1 *1.615=1.615.

0.17686 *1.615: compute 0.1*1.615=0.1615, 0.07 *1.615=0.11305, 0.00686*1.615≈0.01107.

Adding these: 0.1615 +0.11305=0.27455 +0.01107≈0.28562.

So total 1.615 +0.28562=1.90062.

Now, divide by 3π: 1.90062 /9.42477796≈0.2016.

Again, 0.2016 *365≈73.584 days. Still about 73.58 days.

Hmm. So it's approximately 74 days, but the options don't have that. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps.

Wait, perhaps the formula is supposed to be applied differently. Let me re-examine the formula.

The formula is:

sqrt(2(1-β)) * (1 + 2β) / (3π) * 1 year.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption that β is Mercury's perihelion is incorrect. Maybe the perihelion is given in terms of Earth's orbit radius, but perhaps the actual perihelion is different. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the exact perihelion in AU.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the perihelion distance of Mercury as 0.307 AU, so β=0.307.

Wait, I think I've done this correctly. So the calculation leads to approximately 73.58 days, which is about 74 days. Since the options don't have 74, but option B is 72, option H is76.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is around 73.5, which is closest to 74, but since that's not an option, I might have made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the formula provided is in Earth years, and I need to convert correctly.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula is correct, but maybe the initial approach is to use the orbital period of the comet. Wait, but the comet is in a parabolic orbit, which technically has an infinite period, but the formula given must be an approximation for the time within Earth's orbit.

Wait, another approach. Let's think about the time the comet spends inside Earth's orbit.

The comet's path is a parabola. The perihelion is at β r_E. The Earth is at r_E. So the points where the comet enters and exits Earth's orbit are at r_E.

The time taken to go from perihelion to the point r_E can be found using Kepler's equations. Wait, but for a parabola, the energy is zero, so the specific orbital energy is zero.

The equation of a parabola is r = (l) / (1 + e cosθ), but for a parabola, e=1, so r = (l)/(1 + cosθ).

Alternatively, the focus is at the Sun. So the perihelion is at r = l/(1+1)=l/2.

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the vis-viva equation. The vis-viva equation for a parabolic orbit is v^2 = 2
