Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where James took a loan of $240 for 30 days at 6% interest. I need to find out how much interest he has to pay. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on interest calculations, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that interest can be calculated in different ways, like simple interest or compound interest. Since the problem doesn't specify, I'll assume it's simple interest because that's the most common for short-term loans like 30 days.

The formula for simple interest is I = P * r * t, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, r is the rate of interest, and t is the time in years. Wait, but the time here is given in days, so I need to convert that into years.

So the principal P is $240, the rate r is 6%, which I think I need to convert into a decimal. To do that, I divide by 100, so 6% becomes 0.06. The time t is 30 days. Since the interest is probably calculated on a yearly basis, I'll convert 30 days into a fraction of a year.

There are 365 days in a year, so 30 days is 30/365 of a year. Let me calculate that: 30 divided by 365 is approximately 0.0821918 years.

Now putting it all into the formula: I = 240 * 0.06 * (30/365). Let me compute this step by step. First, 240 multiplied by 0.06. Let's see, 240 times 0.06 is 14.4. Then, multiply that by 30/365.

Wait, 30/365 is approximately 0.0821918. So 14.4 multiplied by 0.0821918. Hmm, let me calculate that. 14.4 times 0.08 is 1.152, and 14.4 times 0.0021918 is roughly 0.0316. Adding those together gives about 1.1836. So approximately $1.18.

Looking at the options, I see option I is $1.80, which is close but not exact. Wait, maybe I did something wrong in my calculations. Let me double-check.

Alternatively, maybe the interest is calculated differently. Oh wait, sometimes interest rates are given as annual percentage rates, but applied over a different period. But I think I did it right by converting 30 days into a fraction of a year.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me recalculate. 240 * 0.06 is indeed 14.4. Then 14.4 * (30/365). Let's compute 30/365 first. 30 divided by 365 is approximately 0.0821918. So 14.4 * 0.0821918.

Let me do this more accurately. 14.4 * 0.08 = 1.152. Now, 14.4 * 0.0021918: 14.4 * 0.002 is 0.0288, and 14.4 * 0.0001918 is about 0.00276. Adding those gives 0.0288 + 0.00276 = 0.03156. So total is 1.152 + 0.03156 = 1.18356, which is about $1.18.

Looking at the options again, the closest is option I: $1.80, but that's higher. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the interest is calculated as 6% per month, but that would be higher. Wait, no, the problem says 6% interest, but doesn't specify per annum or per month. Oh wait, maybe it's 6% per month? Let me think.

If it's 6% per month, then for one month (30 days), the interest would be 240 * 0.06 = 14.4. But that's option B: $14.40. But that seems high for 30 days. Also, the options don't include $1.18 exactly. So maybe I should check my calculation again.

Wait another approach: sometimes interest is calculated as (P * r * t)/100. Let me try that. So P is 240, r is 6, t is 30 days. But usually, in the formula, t is in years, so t would be 30/365. So (240 * 6 * (30/365)) / 100. Let's compute that.

First, 240 *6 = 1440. Then 1440 *30 = 43200. Divide by 365: 43200 /365 is approximately 118.356. Then divide by 100 gives 1.18356. So again, about $1.18.

But none of the options match exactly. The closest is option I: $1.80. Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the time. Maybe the interest is for 30 days but the rate is annual, so using 30/360 instead of 365? That's sometimes done in some financial calculations as an approximation.

So let's try t = 30/360, which is 1/12 of a year. Then I = 240 * 0.06 * (1/12). Let's compute that. 0.06 divided by 12 is 0.005. So 240 * 0.005 = 1.2. So that would be $1.20, which is option J.

Wait, but why would they use 360 days in a year? I thought it's more common to use 365, but maybe in some financial contexts, 360 is used, especially in banking. So perhaps the correct approach is to use 30/360, leading to $1.20.

Looking back at the options, option J is $1.20. But earlier I thought using 365 gives around $1.18, which isn't an option. So perhaps the intended approach is to use 30/360, making the interest $1.20, which is option J.

Alternatively, maybe the interest is calculated as 6% per annum, but the time is 30 days, so 30/365. Let me recalculate that precisely.

Using a calculator: (240 * 6 * 30) / (365 * 100). So 240*6=1440; 1440*30=43200. 43200 / (365*100) = 43200 / 36500 â‰ˆ 1.1835, so $1.18. But since the options don't have this, perhaps the intended answer is J: $1.20.

Wait, but another thought: maybe the question is considering 6% as a monthly rate, not annual. Oh! If the 6% is per month, then for 30 days (which is roughly a month), the interest would be 240 * 0.06 = $14.40, which is option B. But that seems high, and it's unclear if the rate is monthly or annually.

The problem states 6% interest, without specifying the period. Usually, when not specified, it's assumed to be annual. So the correct approach would be to calculate based on a year. So using 30/365 or 30/360.

Given that, and seeing that option J is $1.20, which aligns with using 30/360, perhaps that's the intended answer. Alternatively, maybe the question expects a different approach.

Wait, another way to think: sometimes interest for a month is approximated as 1/12 of the annual rate. So 6% annual would be 0.5% monthly. Then 240 * 0.005 = $1.20. So that would be option J.

Yes, that makes sense. So James has to pay $1.20 in interest. So the correct answer should be J.
</think>

To calculate the interest James has to pay on a $240 loan for 30 days at 6% interest, we assume simple interest. The formula for simple interest is:

\[
I = P \cdot r \cdot t
\]

Where:
- \( P = 240 \) (principal amount),
- \( r = 0.06 \) (6% annual interest rate expressed as a decimal),
- \( t = \frac{30}{365} \) (30 days converted to a fraction of a year).

Substituting the values:

\[
I = 240 \cdot 0.06 \cdot \frac{30}{365}
\]

First, calculate \( 240 \cdot 0.06 = 14.4 \). Then, multiply by \( \frac{30}{365} \):

\[
I = 14.4 \cdot \frac{30}{365} \approx 14.4 \cdot 0.0821918 \approx 1.18356
\]

This gives approximately $1.18 in interest. However, none of the options exactly match this value. 

Considering the possibility that the time is approximated using \( t = \frac{30}{360} \) (a common financial convention where the year is assumed to have 360 days), we recalculate:

\[
t = \frac{30}{360} = \frac{1}{12}
\]

Substituting this into the formula:

\[
I = 240 \cdot 0.06 \cdot \frac{1}{12} = 240 \cdot 0.005 = 1.2
\]

This gives $1.20 in interest, which matches option J. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**J: $1.20**
