Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about spaceships and length contraction. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my relativity, but I'll try to think it through.

So the setup is: two spaceships are approaching Earth with equal speeds, but from opposite directions. An observer on Earth would measure their speeds as the same. Now, someone on one spaceship measures a meterstick on the other spaceship as 60 cm long. I need to find the speed of each spaceship according to the Earth observer.

Wait, right, length contraction in special relativity. When an object is moving relative to an observer, its length in the direction of motion is contracted. The formula for length contraction is L = L0 * sqrt(1 - v²/c²), where L is the contracted length, L0 is the proper length (at rest), and v is the speed.

But wait, in this scenario, each spaceship is moving relative to Earth. So the Earth observer sees each spaceship moving at speed v, so from Earth's frame, each spaceship's meterstick would appear contracted. But that's not what's happening here. The problem says that an occupant of one spaceship measures the other's meterstick as 60 cm. So it's the measurement between two moving spaceships.

Oh right, so it's a problem involving relative velocity between the spaceships. Let me clarify the frames involved.

Let's denote:

- Earth frame: S
- Spaceship 1: S1 (approaching from one direction)
- Spaceship 2: S2 (approaching from the opposite direction)

In Earth's frame, both S1 and S2 have speed v towards Earth, but in opposite directions. So their velocities are +v and -v, perhaps. Wait, but if they're approaching Earth from opposite directions, their velocities relative to Earth are opposite in direction, but same in magnitude. So if S1 is moving at velocity u (say to the left), S2 would be moving at velocity -u (to the right), but the magnitude is same, so |u|=v each.

But wait, no. Wait, the problem says they approach Earth with equal speeds as measured by Earth. So each has speed v towards Earth, but opposite directions. So S1 might be moving at velocity v (say, to the west), and S2 at velocity -v (east), but in Earth's frame, both are approaching, perhaps? Wait, maybe I got that wrong. If two spaceships are approaching Earth from opposite directions, one might be moving to the left at speed v, the other to the right at speed v, but Earth is in the middle. So from Earth's perspective, each is moving towards Earth at speed v, but in opposite directions. So their closing speed relative to each other would be 2v, but that's not directly relevant here.

But the main point is that each spaceship's speed is v according to Earth. But the measurement is done by someone in one spaceship looking at the other. So it's the length contraction as seen from S1 looking at S2's meterstick.

Wait, so the proper length of the meterstick is 1 meter, as measured in its rest frame (S2). But someone in S1 measures it as 60 cm. So the contracted length is 0.6 meters.

So applying the length contraction formula, L = L0 * sqrt(1 - u²/c²), where u is the relative velocity between S1 and S2.

Wait, no. Because the observer in S1 is measuring the length of S2's meterstick. So the relative velocity between S1 and S2 is important here.

Wait, what's the relative velocity between the two spaceships as observed from Earth? Because in Earth's frame, S1 is moving at v to the left, S2 at v to the right. So their relative speed, as observed from Earth, would be 2v. Because if you have two objects moving towards each other at v each, their relative speed is v + v = 2v.

But wait, in the problem, each spaceship's speed is v relative to Earth. So the speed of S1 relative to Earth is v (say, to the left), and the speed of S2 relative to Earth is v to the right. So from S1's perspective, S2 is moving at a higher speed. That's where velocity addition comes into play.

Wait, but in special relativity, velocities don't just add up like that. The correct way to compute the relative velocity between S1 and S2 is using the velocity addition formula.

But perhaps there's a simpler way. Let me think.

In Earth's frame, S1 is moving left at v, S2 moving right at v. So from Earth, the speed of S2 relative to S1 is (v_right + v_left) = 2v? Because in classical mechanics, velocities add, but in relativity, they don't. So I need to use the relativistic velocity addition formula.

The formula for the velocity of S2 as seen from S1's frame is given by (u' + v)/(1 + (u' v)/c² ), where u' is the velocity of S2 in Earth's frame, and v is the velocity of Earth relative to S1.

Wait, let me get this straight.

In Earth's frame:

- S1 is moving at velocity v (let's say to the left, so velocity is -v).

- S2 is moving at velocity v (to the right, so +v).

So from Earth's frame, S2 is moving at u = +v, and S1 is moving at u = -v.

What's the velocity of S2 as observed from S1's frame?

The velocity addition formula in special relativity is:

u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/c² )

Wait, no. Wait, the formula is for transforming velocities between frames. If frame S' is moving at velocity v relative to frame S, then the velocity u' of an object in S' is given by u' = (u - v)/(1 - (u v)/c² )

In this case, S1 is moving at velocity v relative to Earth (S). So the Earth is moving at velocity -v relative to S1.

So, to find the velocity of S2 as seen from S1's frame, which is moving at velocity v (to the left) relative to Earth.

In Earth's frame, S2's velocity is +v (to the right). So using the velocity addition formula to get S2's velocity in S1's frame:

u' = (u - v_S1) / (1 - (u * v_S1)/c² )

Wait, because in this case, S1 is moving at v (to the left) relative to Earth, so v_S1 = -v (if Earth is S and S1 is S', then v would be negative perhaps).

Wait, maybe better to assign:

Earth frame: S

S1 is moving at u = -v (left direction)

S2 is moving at u = +v (right direction)

So, what's the velocity of S2 in S1's frame?

Using the velocity addition formula:

u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/c² )

Here, u is the velocity of S2 in Earth's frame, which is +v.

v is the velocity of Earth relative to S1. Since S1 is moving at -v relative to Earth, Earth is moving at +v relative to S1. So v would be +v.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of S1's frame being the moving frame. So, the velocity of an object (S2) in S1's frame is given by:

u' = (u + v) / (1 + (u v)/c² )

Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Let me make sure.

The standard formula is:

If S' is moving at velocity v relative to S, then the velocity u' of an object in S' is:

u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/c² )

In this case, S1 is moving at velocity v (to the left) relative to S (Earth). So from S1's frame, which is S', the Earth is moving at velocity -v (to the right), since S' (S1) is moving left at v in S (Earth).

Wait, so to find the velocity of S2 (which is moving at u = +v in Earth's frame) as seen from S1's frame, we use u' = (u - v_S1) / (1 - (u v_S1)/c² )

Wait, v_S1 is the velocity of S1 relative to Earth, which is -v, since S1 is moving left (negative direction) at speed v.

So substituting:

u' = (u - (-v)) / (1 - (u (-v))/c² )

Wait, no. Let me clarify:

In the velocity addition formula, u is the velocity of the object (S2) in Earth's frame. v is the velocity of S' (S1) relative to Earth. So v is -v in this case because S1 is moving at -v in Earth’s frame.

So:

u' = (u - v) / (1 - (u v)/c² )

So plugging in u = +v, v = -v (because S1 is moving at v to the left, which is -v in Earth's frame).

So substituting:

u' = (v - (-v)) / (1 - (v * (-v))/c² )

= (2v) / (1 + v²/c² )

So the velocity of S2 as seen from S1 is 2v/(1 + v²/c² )

That's the relative velocity between the two spaceships from S1's frame.

Now, in S1's frame, the meterstick of S2 is moving at this velocity u'. The proper length L0 of the meterstick is 1 meter. The length measured in S1's frame (L) is 60 cm = 0.6 meters.

So applying the length contraction formula:

L = L0 * sqrt(1 - (u'^2)/(c^2) )

Wait, but length contraction is only in the direction of motion. Since the meterstick is along the direction of motion, so yes, it's contracted.

So:

0.6 m = 1 m * sqrt(1 - (u'^2)/(c^2) )

Divide both sides by 1 m:

0.6 = sqrt(1 - (u'^2)/(c^2) )

Square both sides:

0.36 = 1 - (u'^2)/(c^2 )

=> (u'^2)/(c^2) = 1 - 0.36 = 0.64

=> u'^2 = 0.64 c^2

=> u' = 0.8 c

So the relative velocity u' between S1 and S2 is 0.8 times the speed of light.

But earlier, we found that u' = 2v/(1 + v²/c² )

So:

2v/(1 + (v²/c²)) ) = 0.8 c

Let me write this equation:

(2v) / (1 + (v²/c²)) ) = 0.8 c

Let me solve for v.

Multiply both sides by denominator:

2v = 0.8 c (1 + v²/c² )

Let me write this as:

2v = 0.8 c (1 + (v²)/(c²) )

Divide both sides by 0.8 c:

(2v) / (0.8 c) ) = 1 + (v²)/(c² )

Simplify 2 / 0.8 = 2.5, so:

(2.5 v ) / c = 1 + (v²)/(c² )

Let me set x = v/c, so x is the speed in terms of c.

Then equation becomes:

2.5 x = 1 + x^2

Rearranged:

x^2 - 2.5 x + 1 = 0

Wait, wait, wait:

Wait, 2.5 x = 1 + x² ?

Wait, no, 2.5 x = 1 + x² → x² - 2.5 x +1 = 0.

Wait, no, moving all terms to left:

x² - 2.5 x +1 = 0.

Wait, let's solve quadratic equation:

x² - 2.5 x + 1 = 0

Using quadratic formula:

x = [2.5 ± sqrt( (2.5)^2 - 4*1*1 ) ] / 2

Compute discriminant:

(2.5)^2 = 6.25

4*1*1=4

sqrt(6.25 - 4) = sqrt(2.25) = 1.5

So,

x = [2.5 ± 1.5 ] / 2

Two solutions:

x1 = (2.5 +1.5)/2 = 4/2 = 2 → x=2? But that would mean v=2c, which is impossible. So discard this solution.

x2 = (2.5 -1.5)/2 = 1/2 = 0.5 → v=0.5 c.

Wait, so v is 0.5c?

But wait, let's double-check the calculations.

So, when I set x = v/c, the equation was:

2.5 x = 1 + x² → x² - 2.5 x +1 =0

Solutions:

x = [2.5 ± sqrt(6.25 -4)] /2 → [2.5 ± 1.5]/2 → 4/2=2, or 1/2=0.5

So x=0.5 is acceptable, so v=0.5c.

Wait, but let me check the steps again to ensure no mistake.

So, when I said u' = 2v/(1 + v²/c² ) = 0.8c.

Then substituted 2v/(1 + v²/c² )=0.8c → 2v =0.8c (1 + v²/c² )

Then 2v = 0.8c [ (c² + v² ) / c² ] → 2v = 0.8 (c (c² + v² )) / c² → 2v = 0.8 (c² + v² ) / c → 2v c =0.8 (c² + v² )

Divide both sides by c:

2v = 0.8 (c + v²/c )

Hmm, perhaps it's easier to do without substituting x.

Wait, let me retrace:

We have:

2v = 0.8 c (1 + (v²)/(c^2) )

Divide both sides by c:

(2v)/c = 0.8 (1 + (v^2)/(c^2) )

Let x = v/c, so 2x = 0.8 (1 + x² )

So 2x = 0.8 + 0.8 x² → 0.8 x² -2x +0.8 =0 → multiply both sides by (1/0.8) to simplify:

x² - (2/0.8) x +1 =0 → 2/0.8 is 2.5, so x² -2.5x +1 =0, which is same as before.

So x= [2.5 ± sqrt(6.25-4)]/2 → x= [2.5 ±1.5]/2.

So x=2 or 0.5 → v=2c or 0.5c. But 2c is impossible, so v=0.5c.

So each spaceship is moving at 0.5c relative to Earth.

Looking back at the options, option F is 0.5c. So the answer should be F.

Wait, but let me cross-verify.

If v=0.5c, then the relative velocity u' between the spaceships is:

u' = 2v/(1 + (v^2)/(c^2)) → 2*(0.5c) / (1 + 0.25 ) → (c) / (1.25) → (4/5)c = 0.8c.

Which matches our earlier calculation. Then, the length contraction factor is sqrt(1 - u'^2/c^2 )= sqrt(1 - 0.64 )= sqrt(0.36)=0.6. So the length is 0.6 meters, which matches the problem statement. So yes, v=0.5c is correct.
</think>

To solve the problem, we analyze the situation using special relativity. Two spaceships approach Earth with equal speeds, \( v \), as measured by an observer on Earth, but from opposite directions. An occupant of one spaceship measures the meterstick of the other spaceship to be 60 cm long. The proper length of the meterstick is 1 meter, and the contracted length is given by the formula for length contraction:

\[
L = L_0 \sqrt{1 - \frac{u'^2}{c^2}}
\]

Here:
- \( L_0 = 1 \, \text{m} \) (proper length of the meterstick),
- \( L = 0.6 \, \text{m} \) (contracted length),
- \( u' \) is the relative velocity between the two spaceships.

### Step 1: Relative velocity between the spaceships
In Earth's frame:
- Spaceship 1 (S1) is moving at velocity \( -v \) (to the left),
- Spaceship 2 (S2) is moving at velocity \( +v \) (to the right).

The relative velocity \( u' \) of S2 as seen from S1 is calculated using the relativistic velocity addition formula:

\[
u' = \frac{u - v}{1 - \frac{uv}{c^2}}
\]

Substituting \( u = +v \) (velocity of S2 in Earth's frame) and \( v = -v \) (velocity of S1 relative to Earth):

\[
u' = \frac{v - (-v)}{1 - \frac{v(-v)}{c^2}} = \frac{2v}{1 + \frac{v^2}{c^2}}
\]

### Step 2: Solve for \( v \) using length contraction
The length contraction formula is applied in S1's frame, where the meterstick of S2 is moving at \( u' \):

\[
L = L_0 \sqrt{1 - \frac{u'^2}{c^2}}
\]

Substituting \( L = 0.6 \, \text{m} \), \( L_0 = 1 \, \text{m} \
