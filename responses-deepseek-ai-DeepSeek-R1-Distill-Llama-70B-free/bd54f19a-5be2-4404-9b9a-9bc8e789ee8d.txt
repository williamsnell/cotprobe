Okay, so I've got this question about calculating the bill rate and the coupon-issue yield equivalent for a bill. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

First, let's understand what the bill rate is. From what I remember, the bill rate is the discount rate applied to a Treasury bill. Since T-bills are sold at a discount and mature at face value, the bill rate is calculated based on that discount.

The formula for the bill rate, if I recall correctly, is: 

Bill Rate (%) = (Face Value - Price) / Face Value * (365 / Days to Maturity) * 100.

Wait, but wait, sometimes I get confused between 360 and 365 days. Oh right, for T-bills, the standard is 360 days in a year. No wait, no, wait. No, I think the bill rate uses 360 days. Or is it 365? Hmm, I'm a bit mixed up. Let me think. Oh right, the formula for the bank discount rate uses 360 days, which is the standard in the money markets. So that's 360 days in a year.

So the formula would be:
Bill Rate = [(Face Value - Price) / Face Value] * (360 / Days to Maturity) * 100.

But wait, I should double-check because sometimes it's the other way around when calculating yields. Alternatively, the formula could be (D / (F * (1 + (r * t)))), but I think that's more for yields. Let me clarify.

Wait, no. The bill rate is also known as the discount rate. So the discount is calculated as:

Discount = (Face Value - Price) = D.

So, the discount rate (bill rate) is (D / F) * (360 / t), where t is days to maturity. That makes sense.

Now, the coupon-issue yield equivalent is a bit trickier. I think this is the yield that a coupon-paying bond would need to have to be equivalent to the T-bill's return. The formula for that is different because coupon bonds pay interest periodically, usually semi-annually for government bonds.

Wait, but for the coupon-issue yield, I think it's calculated using the formula:

Yield = (C + (F - P) * t') / (P * t' )

Wait, no, maybe not. Alternatively, for the equivalent yield, it's based on the effective annual rate. Alternatively, I've heard of the coupon equivalent yield, which adjusts the discount rate to a coupon yield.

Another approach: The coupon equivalent yield can be calculated using the formula:

Coupon Equivalent Yield = (D / (F - D)) * (365 / t).

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Or perhaps it's:

Yield = (D / (F - D)) * (365 / t).

Wait, but I'm getting confused with the exact formula. Let me think again.

The bill rate is the discount rate, so the coupon equivalent would be the yield that a coupon bond would have to match this return. Since the T-bill is a zero-coupon instrument, the coupon equivalent is higher because coupon bonds pay interest periodically.

Wait, I think the formula for coupon equivalent yield (also called the coupon-issue yield equivalent) is:

Yield = (D / (F - D)) * (365 / t).

But wait, let me make sure. Another way to look at it is that for a T-bill, the return is (F - P)/P over t days. To annualize this, you can use 360 or 365 days. But when comparing to a coupon bond, which pays coupons semi-annually, the formula uses 365 days.

Wait, perhaps the coupon equivalent yield uses 365 days in its calculation. So maybe the formula is:

Yield = ((F - P)/P) * (365 / t) * 100.

Wait, but that's the same as the effective annual rate. Hmm, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, let me think about the two rates.

Bill rate is calculated using 360 days, as the standard in money markets.

The coupon-issue yield equivalent is calculated using 365 days, to match the bond market convention, which uses 365 days.

So, for the bill rate:

Bill Rate = [(F - P)/F] * (360 / t).

And for the coupon equivalent yield:

Coupon YTM = [(F - P)/P] * (365 / t).

Wait, no. Because the first formula uses F as the denominator, and the second uses P. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think.

Alternatively, the bill rate is (D/F) * (360/t), where D is the discount (F - P).

The coupon equivalent would be (D/(F - D)) * (365/t) * 100.

Wait, but I'm not confident. Let's look for an example.

Suppose F = $100, P = $97. So D = $3.

t = say, 91 days.

Bill rate = (3/100) * (360/91) ≈ 0.03 * 3.956 ≈ 0.1187 or ~11.87%.

Coupon equivalent would be (3/(100 - 3)) * (365/91) = (3/97) * (4.01099) ≈ 0.0309278 * 4.01099 ≈ ~0.12407 or ~12.41%.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the coupon equivalent is calculated as [(F - P)/P] * (365/t) * 100.

So in this example, (3/97) * (365/91) * 100.

3/97 is ~0.0309278. 365/91 is ~4.010989.

Multiply them: 0.0309278 * 4.010989 ≈ 0.12407 or 12.407%.

So in that case, the coupon equivalent is higher than the bill rate, which makes sense because a coupon bond paying interest would have a higher yield than a zero-coupon bond with the same maturity.

Wait, but in the question, the numbers are:

Price is $97,987. So I assume the face value is $100,000 because T-bills are typically sold in denominations like that. Wait, but the price here is 97,987. So F is 100,000, P is 97,987, and t is 91 days.

So let's calculate the bill rate first.

Bill Rate = [(100,000 - 97,987) / 100,000] * (360 / 91) * 100.

Compute the numerator: 100,000 - 97,987 = 2,013.

So (2,013 / 100,000) = 0.02013.

Multiply by (360 / 91) → 360/91 ≈ 3.956.

So 0.02013 * 3.956 ≈ let's compute that.

0.02 * 3.956 is 0.07912. 0.00013 * 3.956 ≈ 0.000514. So total ≈ 0.079634, or 7.9634%.

So about 7.96% as the bill rate.

Now, the coupon-issue yield equivalent. Using the formula I thought earlier, which is [(F - P)/P] * (365/t) * 100.

So F = 100,000, P = 97,987, t=91.

F - P = 2,013.

(2,013 / 97,987) ≈ 0.02056.

365 /91 ≈ 4.010989.

Multiply 0.02056 * 4.010989 ≈ 0.0825.

So approximately 8.25% as the coupon equivalent yield.

Wait, but let me be precise.

Let me compute (2,013 / 97,987) = ?

Let me compute 2013 divided by 97987.

Well, 97987 * 0.02 = 1,959.74. 2013 - 1959.74 = 53.26.

So 53.26 / 97987 ≈ 0.0005438.

So total is 0.0205438.

Multiply by 365/91 → 4.010989.

0.0205438 * 4.010989 ≈ Let's compute:

0.02 * 4.010989 = 0.080218.

0.0005438 *4.010989 ≈ approx 0.002181.

Sum is 0.0824, which is 8.24%.

So the coupon equivalent is approximately 8.24%.

Looking back at the options:

Option C: Bill rate 7.96%, Coupon 8.24% → yes, that's option C.

Option E is Bill 8.24, Coupon 7.96 → no.

Option H: both 7.96 → no.

Wait, let's make sure. Let me recalculate the bill rate more accurately.

Bill rate:

(2013 / 100,000) = 0.02013.

(360 /91)= 3.956043.

Multiply 0.02013 * 3.956043:

0.02 *3.956043=0.079121.

0.00013 *3.956043=0.000514.

Sum: 0.079635 → 7.9635%, which rounds to 7.96% as the bill rate.

Coupon equivalent:

(2013 /97987) = let's compute:

2013 ÷ 97987.

97987 * 0.02 = 1959.74.

2013 - 1959.74 = 53.26.

53.26 ÷ 97987 → 53.26 /97987 ≈ 0.0005438.

So 0.02 + 0.0005438 = 0.0205438.

Multiply by (365/91)=4.010989.

0.0205438 *4.010989 → let's compute this accurately.

0.02 *4.010989 = 0.08022.

0.0005438 *4.010989 ≈ 0.002181.

Sum: 0.082401, which is 8.2401%, so 8.24%.

So the bill rate is 7.96%, and the coupon equivalent is 8.24%. So the correct option is C: Bill rate 7.96%, Coupon 8.24%.

Looking at the options, option C says exactly that.
