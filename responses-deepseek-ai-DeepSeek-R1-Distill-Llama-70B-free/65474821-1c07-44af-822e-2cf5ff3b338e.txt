Question:

A home security protection company provided protection services to property owners in the immediate area. The owner of a summer cottage in the area hired the company to provide 24- hour protection during the winter months when his home was unoccupied. According to the security arrangement, the company's uniformed guards would periodically patrol the property and, if necessary, provide an "armed response" to any unauthorized individuals who were found trespassing on the property. The company provided security protection to the owner's property for two years. The owner then notified the company that he was planning to sell the cottage. As a result, he requested that the company discontinue its home-protection service, effective immediately. Two weeks later, a burglar broke into the cottage and was ransacking it. As the burglar was exiting from the owner's house carrying a portable television set, he was seen by a security guard working for the company. The security guard, who was driving past the home on security patrol, had not been informed that the owner had discontinued protection services. The security guard suddenly stopped his patrol vehicle and ran toward the burglar shouting, "Stop! Don't move or I'll shoot!" Startled, the burglar dropped the television set and began to flee. Believing that the suspected burglar was about to escape, the security guard pulled out his service revolver and fired a bullet at the burglar. The shot struck the burglar in the leg, seriously wounding him. If the burglar asserts a claim against the owner for negligently failing to supervise those providing security services for the owner's property, the burglar will probably

Options:

A: not prevail, because the security guard was acting in the course of his duties.
B: prevail, because the burglar was unarmed when he was shot.
C: prevail, because the security guard acted without proper authorization.
D: prevail, because the security guard used excessive force.
E: not prevail, because the owner was not present when the shooting occurred.
F: not prevail, because the owner had discontinued protection services from the company when the shooting occurred.
G: prevail, because the owner knew or had reason to know that the company provided an "armed response" to suspected trespassers.
H: not prevail, because the owner had no control over the actions of the security guard.
I: prevail, because the owner did not properly inform the company of the discontinued services.
J: not prevail, because the burglar was trespassing on private property.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about negligence and liability. Let me read through the scenario again and break it down.

So, there's a home security company that was hired by a cottage owner to provide 24-hour protection during the winter when the cottage is unoccupied. They have uniformed guards patrolling and an armed response if needed. They did this for two years. Then the owner decided to sell the cottage and asked the company to stop their services immediately. Two weeks later, a burglar broke in. A security guard, who wasn't told that the services were discontinued, saw the burglar, yelled at him, and then shot him in the leg.

The question is about whether the burglar can sue the owner for negligent failure to supervise the security company. The options are from A to J.

Hmm. So, the key here is whether the owner is liable for the guard's actions. I remember that generally, employers are vicariously liable for the actions of their employees performed within the scope of their employment. But wait, in this case, the owner isn't the employer; the security company is. So the owner hired the company, which is an independent contractor.

Wait, but the question is about the owner's duty to supervise. So maybe the issue is whether the owner failed to properly inform the company that services were discontinued. Because if the guard wasn't informed, he might have still been acting under the initial agreement.

Option I says the burglar would prevail because the owner didn't properly inform the company. But I'm not sure. The owner did notify the company to discontinue services, but the guard wasn't told. So maybe the company was still acting on the owner's behalf, thinking they were still employed. So the owner might be liable because he didn't ensure that the guards were notified.

Wait, but another angle is that the security company is an independent contractor. Typically, the person hiring an independent contractor isn't liable for the contractor's employees' actions unless there's something specific, like the contractor's actions were authorized or the hiring party was negligent in selecting or supervising the contractor.

In this case, the owner told the company to stop, but the guard wasn't informed. So the guard was acting under the contract, but the contract had been terminated. So the guard was possibly acting outside the scope of his duties because the service was supposed to have stopped.

Wait, but the guard didn't know. So when he saw the burglar, he was still performing his patrol as per the original agreement. So from the guard's perspective, he was still on duty. So the owner's failure to inform the guard might mean that the owner is still responsible because the guard was acting under the initial contract.

Alternatively, maybe the owner is not liable because he had already told the company to stop. So the company should have informed their guards, and the owner isn't responsible for the company's failure to communicate.

But the question is whether the owner negligently failed to supervise. So, by not ensuring that the company stopped the patrols, perhaps the owner is liable.

Looking at the options, option G says the owner knew or had reason to know that the company provided an armed response. So if the owner knew that, maybe he should have made sure the guards were stood down properly.

Alternatively, option I says the owner didn't properly inform the company, which led to the guard still being on patrol.

Wait, but the owner did notify the company. The problem was that the guard wasn't informed. So the owner might not be liable because he took the step of notifying the company. Unless the owner had a duty to ensure that the guards were informed, which might not be the case because the company is an independent contractor. The owner wouldn't typically be responsible for the internal communications of the company.

So, in that case, the owner isn't liable because the guard's actions were beyond the owner's control after the service was discontinued.

Looking at the options, option H says the owner isn't liable because he had no control over the security guard. That makes sense because the guard is an employee of the independent contractor, not the owner.

But another thought: when you hire a contractor, you're responsible if you direct their actions in a way that's negligent. Maybe the owner should have ensured that the patrols were stopped, but I don't think that's the case here. The owner told the company to stop, so it's the company's responsibility to inform their employees.

So the owner isn't liable because he had no control over the guard's actions once he terminated the service. So the correct answer would be either F or H.

Option F says the owner isn't liable because he had discontinued services when the shooting happened. But the guard was still acting under the initial agreement, so maybe the discontinuation wasn't effectively communicated, making the guard's actions a mistake.

But the owner can't be held responsible for the guard's mistake beyond his control. So F says the owner isn't liable because the services were discontinued. But the guard was still acting in the scope of his employment, which was based on the owner's initial contract.

Wait, but if the owner had canceled the service, and the guard was no longer authorized, then perhaps the guard was acting outside the scope. But the guard didn't know that, so from his perspective, he was still working.

So the owner's cancellation was effective, but the guard wasn't informed. So the guard's actions wouldn't be attributed to the owner because the owner had already terminated the contract.

So the correct answer might be F: not prevail because the owner had discontinued protection services when the shooting occurred.

Alternatively, option H says the owner had no control over the guard. That's also a possibility.

I think the key is that the owner isn't the employer, so vicarious liability doesn't apply. The owner's only responsibility would be if he was negligent in hiring or supervising, but since he's not the employer, he isn't.

So the answer is probably F or H.

Wait, looking at the options again. Option F: not prevail, because the owner had discontinued services when the shooting occurred.

But the guard was still acting in the scope, thinking he was employed. So perhaps the owner is still liable because the guard was acting under the initial contract, which the owner had terminated but the guard wasn't aware. So the owner might be liable because he didn't take steps to ensure the guard knew.

But I'm not sure. It's a bit tricky. Maybe the correct answer is G: because the owner knew about the armed response. So the owner should have made sure that the guards were informed when the service was stopped. If the owner knew the guards were armed and might use force, perhaps he had a duty to ensure they were told to stand down.

In that case, the owner could be negligent for not ensuring proper communication, leading to the guard using armed response when he shouldn't have been there.

So option G says the owner knew or should have known about the armed response, so he had a duty to supervise.

I think that makes sense. So the owner is liable because he knew the guards were authorized to use armed response, and he should have made sure they were told to stop, so the guard wouldn't act in that manner anymore.

So the answer would be G.

The question revolves around whether the owner of the cottage can be held liable for the security guard's actions when the guard shot the burglar, despite the owner having discontinued security services. The key issue is whether the owner negligently failed to supervise the security company or ensure that the guard was informed of the service cancellation.

The owner hired an independent contractor (the security company) to provide services, and the guard was an employee of that company. Generally, the hiring party is not liable for the actions of an independent contractor's employees unless there is negligence in selection, supervision, or if the contractor's actions were authorized. Here, the owner notified the company to discontinue services, but the guard was not informed, leading him to act under the belief that the contract was still in effect.

Option G suggests that the owner could be liable because he knew or should have known that the security company provided an "armed response" to trespassers. This implies that the owner had a duty to ensure that the guards were properly informed of the service cancellation to prevent such incidents. The owner's failure to take additional steps to communicate the cancellation directly to the guards could constitute negligent supervision, as he was aware of the potential for armed responses.

Other options, such as F and H, focus on the discontinuation of services and the lack of control over the guard, respectively. However, these do not fully address the owner's potential negligence in failing to ensure that the guard was informed of the cancellation, which directly led to the guard's actions.

Thus, the most accurate answer is that the owner may be liable because he knew or should have known about the armed response policy and failed to ensure that the guard was informed of the service cancellation.
