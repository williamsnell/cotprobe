Okay, so I have this economics question about price elasticity and total revenue. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question says a small business estimates the price elasticity of demand for their product to be 3. They want to raise total revenue. The options are about what they should do with the price.

Wait, I remember that price elasticity of demand measures how responsive the quantity demanded is to a change in price. If the elasticity is greater than 1, demand is elastic. If it's less than 1, it's inelastic. Right, so here it's 3, which is definitely elastic.

Now, the total revenue is the product of price and quantity sold. So, TR = P Ã— Q. When demand is elastic, a change in price leads to a bigger change in quantity. 

I think when demand is elastic, if a firm lowers the price, the percentage increase in quantity sold is more than the percentage decrease in price. So, total revenue goes up. Conversely, if they raise the price, quantity demanded drops a lot, and since elasticity is high, TR would decrease.

So the business wants to increase total revenue. Since elasticity is 3, which is elastic, they should lower the price. Lowering price would increase quantity demanded by a larger percentage than the price reduction, making TR rise.

Looking at the options. Let's see:

Option I: decrease price as demand is elastic. That sounds right because decreasing price when elastic would boost TR.

Other options: Option E says increase price as demand is inelastic. But elasticity is 3, so that's not applicable. Option D says increase price as elastic, which would be wrong because increasing price when elastic would lower TR.

Option A says keep price constant as demand is elastic. But if they don't change price, TR doesn't change. They want to raise it, so that's not correct.

Option B says decrease price as demand is inelastic. Wait, no, because inelastic means decreasing price would lower TR. So that's the opposite of what they want.

So the correct action is to decrease the price because demand is elastic. Which is option I.

To determine how the small business should raise total revenue given a price elasticity of demand of 3, it is important to understand the relationship between price elasticity, price changes, and total revenue. Price elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded to a change in price. An elasticity value greater than 1 indicates elastic demand, meaning that a percentage change in price will lead to a larger percentage change in quantity demanded.

When demand is elastic, lowering the price results in a proportionally larger increase in quantity demanded. This increase in quantity sold outweighs the decrease in price, leading to an increase in total revenue. Conversely, raising the price when demand is elastic would lead to a significant decrease in quantity demanded, reducing total revenue.

Given that the elasticity is 3 (elastic demand), the business should decrease the price to increase total revenue. Among the options provided:

- **Option I** correctly states that the business should decrease the price as demand is elastic, which aligns with the analysis. 
- Other options, such as increasing the price (Options D and E) or keeping the price constant (Option A), do not align with the goal of raising total revenue when demand is elastic.

Thus, the correct answer is:

I
