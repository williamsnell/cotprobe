Options:

Okay, so I have this question about asexual reproduction in bryophytes and lower vascular plants. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let's start by recalling what I know about these plants.

Bryophytes are non-vascular plants, right? They include mosses, liverworts, and hornworts. I remember that they reproduce in different ways. I think they can reproduce both sexually and asexually. For asexual reproduction, I've heard about something called gemmae cups. Oh right, gemmae are like small buds that develop in these cup-like structures. When it rains or gets wet, these gemmae can splash out and grow into new plants. So that's a form of asexual reproduction.

Wait, but do they use spores for asexual reproduction too? Spores are usually related to sexual reproduction, but maybe in some cases they can function asexually. Or perhaps not. I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Another method I think is fragmentation. Like, when parts of the plant break off and grow into new individuals. So maybe bryophytes can use fragmentation as well.

Now, lower vascular plants. These are plants with vascular tissues, like ferns and their allies. They reproduce via spores, I believe. They have a life cycle with two generations: the diploid sporophyte and the haploid gametophyte. The sporophyte produces spores asexually through meiosis, which then grow into gametophytes. So spore production is a key method here.

But wait, do lower vascular plants have other asexual methods besides spores? I think some ferns can produce structures like rhizomes or tubers, which can grow into new plants. So that's another form of asexual reproduction. So they might use spores as well as vegetative structures.

Looking at the answer options now.

Option A says both reproduce asexually only through spore dispersal by wind. That doesn't sound right because bryophytes use gemmae and other methods, not just wind-blown spores. Plus, wind might not be the main method for spore dispersal in all cases.

Option B: Bryophytes reproduce by spore formation. Well, they do produce spores, but does that count as asexual? Spores are usually from sexual reproduction, so maybe this is more about sexual than asexual. Also, this doesn't address lower vascular plants.

Option C says bryophytes reproduce only sexually. No, that's incorrect because they do have asexual methods like gemmae.

Option D: Lower vascular plants don't carry out asexual reproduction. That's wrong because they do use spores and other structures. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Lower vascular plants reproduce asexually only through fragmentation. No, they mainly use spores, I think, and maybe other structures like rhizomes. So E is not correct.

Option F: Bryophytes reproduce asexually by producing seeds. No, bryophytes don't produce seeds; they're non-vascular and seedless. So F is wrong.

Option G: Both produce tubers. I'm not sure about bryophytes having tubers. Lower vascular plants might, but bryophytes probably don't. So G is unlikely.

Option H: Bryophytes and some lower vascular plants use budding (gemmae cups), vegetative reproduction, or leaf-borne buds. This sounds correct. Bryophytes use gemmae cups, which is a form of budding. Lower vascular plants might use other vegetative methods like fragmentation or specific buds on leaves.

Option I: Lower vascular use spores, bryophytes use binary fission. Binary fission is more like bacterial reproduction. Bryophytes don't do that, so I is wrong.

Option J: Both reproduce exclusively by vegetative. No, because they also use spores and other methods, so J is incorrect.

So the correct answer should be H. It correctly states that both groups use methods like gemmae cups (budding), vegetative reproduction, and other structures for asexual reproduction.

Bryophytes, which include mosses, liverworts, and hornworts, are non-vascular plants that reproduce both sexually and asexually. Asexual reproduction in bryophytes often involves structures like gemmae cups, where small buds called gemmae develop and can disperse to form new plants. They may also reproduce through fragmentation, where parts of the plant break off and grow into new individuals. On the other hand, lower vascular plants, such as ferns, primarily reproduce asexually through spore production, where spores are dispersed and grow into haploid gametophytes. Additionally, some lower vascular plants can reproduce asexually using vegetative structures like rhizomes or tubers.

Analyzing the options:

- **A** is incorrect because bryophytes do not rely solely on wind-dispersed spores for asexual reproduction; they also use gemmae and fragmentation.
- **B** is misleading because spore formation in bryophytes is more associated with sexual reproduction.
- **C** is incorrect as bryophytes do reproduce asexually.
- **D** is wrong because lower vascular plants do perform asexual reproduction, such as through spores and vegetative structures.
- **E** is incorrect because lower vascular plants are not limited to fragmentation for asexual reproduction.
- **F** is incorrect as bryophytes do not produce seeds.
- **G** is unlikely because bryophytes do not produce tubers.
- **H** is correct as it accurately describes asexual reproduction methods in both bryophytes (e.g., gemmae cups, fragmentation) and lower vascular plants (e.g., spores, vegetative reproduction).
- **I** is incorrect because bryophytes do not use binary fission.
- **J** is incorrect because both groups use methods other than just vegetative reproduction.

Thus, the correct answer is **H**.

Answer: H
