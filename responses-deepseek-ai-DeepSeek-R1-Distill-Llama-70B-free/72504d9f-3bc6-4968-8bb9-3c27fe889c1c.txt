Okay, so I have this problem here about Mr. Reynolds and his auto service business. Let me try to figure this out step by step. Hmm, the question is about calculating the percentage of loss from bad checks.

Alright, so the total income he had last year was $366,000. Out of this, $732 worth of checks were bad, meaning they bounced or were worthless. I need to find out what percentage $732 is of the total income.

Wait, percentage loss from bad checks. So, the formula for percentage is (part / whole) * 100. In this case, the part is the bad checks amount, which is $732, and the whole is the total income, which is $366,000.

So the calculation would be (732 / 366000) * 100. Let me compute that. Let me write it down:

732 divided by 366,000 equals... Let me see. Well, 366,000 is 366 thousand, and 732 is 732 dollars. Hmm, maybe I can simplify the numbers to make it easier.

Wait, both numbers end with 6 and 2, but maybe I can divide numerator and denominator by something. Let me try dividing both by 6. So 732 รท6 is 122, and 366,000 รท6 is 61,000. So now it's 122 / 61,000. Hmm, maybe that's not much better. Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of moving decimals.

Alternatively, I can think about 732 divided by 366,000. Let me do the division step by step. 366,000 goes into 732 how many times? Well, 366 times 2 is 732, but wait, that's 366 multiplied by 2. But here, 732 is the numerator, and 366,000 is the denominator. So 732 divided by 366,000 is the same as (2 * 366) divided by (366 * 1000). Oh wait, because 366,000 is 366 *1000. So 732 is 2*366. So when you divide them, the 366 cancels out, leaving 2 / 1000, which is 0.002. 

Wait, 0.002 as a decimal. To get the percentage, multiply by 100, so that's 0.2%. So the percentage loss is 0.2%.

Looking back at the options, option B is 0.2%, so that should be the correct answer.

To determine the percentage of loss from bad checks, we use the formula for percentage: (part / whole) * 100. Here, the "part" is the amount of bad checks ($732), and the "whole" is the total income ($366,000). 

The calculation is:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{732}{366,000} \right) \times 100
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\frac{732}{366,000} = \frac{2}{1,000} = 0.002
\]

Multiplying by 100 to convert to a percentage:

\[
0.002 \times 100 = 0.2\%
\]

Thus, the percent of loss from bad checks is 0.2%. The correct answer is:

B: .2%

Answer: B
