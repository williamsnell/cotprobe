Okay, so I have this problem about a balanced three-phase three-wire system supplying two Y-connected loads. I'm a bit rusty on three-phase systems, but let's try to think it through step by step.

The question gives me two loads. The first load draws 6 kW at a power factor of 0.8 lagging, and the second requires 12 kW at a power factor of 0.833 leading. The line current in each is 8 Arms. I need to find the current in the first load, the second load, and the source phase.

Wait, wait. Wait a second. Wait, the line current is 8 Arms. But in a three-phase system, each line current is the same for a balanced system, right? But here, there are two separate loads connected. Hmm.

I think each load is connected to the same three-phase supply. Since it's Y-connected, each phase current in the load would be the same as the line current for that load. Or wait, no. Wait, in a Y-connected load, the line current is the same as the phase current because each phase is connected between a line and neutral. But wait, the supply is three-wire, which means there is no neutral return. Oh wait, three-wire would mean it's a delta connection, but the loads are Y-connected. Hmm, no, maybe the supply is three-phase three-wire, so the loads are Y-connected but without a neutral line. So each load would have their phase currents sum to zero. Since it's a balanced system, the currents in each phase are the same in magnitude but 120 degrees apart.

Wait, but each load is Y-connected. So each phase of the load draws the same current. But the supply is three-wire, so it's probably a delta-connected source? Or maybe it's Y-connected but without the neutral. Hmm, I'm a bit confused about that.

So each load has its own line currents. Let me clarify:

In a Y-connected load, the phase current is the same as the line current. But when two Y-connected loads are connected to a three-wire system (which I think is a delta-connected source?), the line currents would be the vector sum of the individual phase currents.

Wait, no, maybe it's better to model each load separately and then find the total line currents.

Wait, the system is balanced, so each phase current from the source should be the same in magnitude and 120 degrees apart in phase.

Let me structure my approach.

Each load is Y-connected, so for each load, the line current (which is the same as the phase current) can be found.

First, Load 1: 6 kW at 0.8 PF lagging.

In a three-phase system, for a Y-connected load, the power formula is:

P = 3 * Vph * Iph * PF

Wait, or wait, another approach: For a Y-connected load, the phase voltage is Vph, and phase current is Iph. The line voltage is Vll = sqrt(3) * Vph.

But wait, the real and reactive power per phase would be Vph * Iph * PF and Vph * Iph * sin(theta), where theta is the angle (PF = cos(theta)).

Wait, for each load, I can find their phase currents.

Wait, but the power given is the total power for each load. So for Load 1, P1 = 6 kW.

So for Load 1, power P1 = 3 * Vph1 * Iph1 * PF1.

But wait, I don't know the voltage. Hmm, but maybe the line current is given as 8 Arms. Wait, but wait, the line current in each line is 8 Arms. So each of the three lines has a current of 8 Arms.

Wait, no. The question says, "the current in each line is 8Arms". Wait, but each load is connected to the same three lines? Or each load has its own set of three lines? I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, the system is a three-phase three-wire system. So two loads are connected in parallel across the three lines. So each line has current flowing through both loads. Hmm. So the line current is the sum of the currents from each load in each phase.

Wait, but each load is Y-connected, so each phase current in the load is equal to the line current for that load. But since both loads are connected in parallel, the total line current is the vector sum of the individual load phase currents.

Wait, but the problem states that the line current in each line is 8 Arms. So the sum of the two load's phase currents in each line is 8 Arms. But since it's a balanced system, the currents in each line are equal in magnitude but 120 degrees apart.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of each load's phase currents and then sum them to get the source phase current. But I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, perhaps each load has its own line current, but the problem says the line current is 8 Arms. No, wait the line current is the same for each line, and the total for each line is the sum of the two loads' contributions in that phase.

Wait, perhaps I should model each load and compute their phase currents, then sum them vectorially in each phase to get the source phase currents.

So, let's start with Load 1: 6 kW, PF 0.8 lagging.

Since it's Y-connected, each phase has the same current. The power P = 3 Vph Iph cos(theta), so Iph = P / (3 Vph cos(theta)).

Wait, but I don't know the voltage. Hmm, perhaps I can express the current in terms of the apparent power.

Wait, the apparent power S for Load 1 is P1 / PF1 = 6000 / 0.8 = 7500 VA.

Similarly, for Load 2: P2 = 12,000 W, PF2 = 0.833 leading. So S2 = 12,000 / 0.833 ≈ 14,400 VA. Wait, 12,000 / (5/6) )= 12,000 * 6/5 = 14,400 VA.

Now, since each load is Y-connected, the phase current Iph is S / (3 Vph). But since I don't know Vph, perhaps I can relate it through the line current.

Wait, but the line current is given as 8 Arms. Wait, but wait, which line current? The line current of the source? So the source's phase current is 8 Arms.

Wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me read it again.

"A balanced three-phase three-wire system supplies two balanced Y-connected loads. The first draws 6-kW at 0.8PF lagging while the other requires 12kW at 0.833PF leading. If the current in each line is 8Arms, find the current in the: (a) first load; (b) second load; (c) source phase."

Wait, I think the current in each line (the source line) is 8 Arms. That is, each of the three lines from the source to the loads has a current of 8 Arms. So each source phase current is 8 Arms.

Wait, but the loads are connected to the same three lines. So each line's current is the vector sum of the currents from each load in that phase.

But since the system is balanced, I think all three line currents are 8 Arms in magnitude, each 120 degrees apart.

So, for each phase (say, phase a), the source current I_sa is 8 Arms. This current is the sum of the current from Load 1 phase a (I1a) and Load 2 phase a (I2a). So I_sa = I1a + I2a.

But since the loads are Y-connected and balanced, each load's phase currents are balanced as well. So for Load 1, each phase current I1a, I1b, I1c have the same magnitude, say I1, and are 120 degrees apart. Similarly for Load 2, each phase current is I2, with the same magnitude and 120 degrees apart.

Wait, no. For a Y-connected load, each phase current is in phase with the respective phase voltage. But the power factor is given, so the current will have a certain phase angle relative to the voltage.

Wait, maybe I should compute the current for each load and then add them vectorially to find the source current.

But to do that, I think I need to find the phase angles of each load's current.

Wait, let's compute the impedance or the current magnitude for each load.

Wait, let's think in terms of complex currents.

For Load 1:

Power P1 = 6 kW = 6000 W.

PF1 = 0.8 lagging, so the angle θ1 = arccos(0.8) ≈ 36.87 degrees, but lagging, so it's +36.87 degrees (since current lags voltage).

The apparent power S1 = P1 / PF1 = 6000 / 0.8 = 7500 VA.

Since it's a Y-connected load, the phase current I1 = S1 / (3 * Vph), but I don't know Vph. Alternatively, the line current for Load 1 is the same as the phase current because it's Y-connected. Wait, no, in a Y-connected load, the line current is the same as the phase current. So I1 = I_phase1 = S1 / (V_line_to_line) ?

Wait, maybe another approach. The line-to-line voltage Vll is related to the phase voltage Vph by Vll = sqrt(3) Vph.

The power for a Y-connected load is P = 3 Vph Iph cos(theta), which is also equal to sqrt(3) Vll Iph cos(theta).

But I'm getting stuck because I don't know the voltage. Wait, perhaps I can express Iph in terms of the power and PF.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the phase currents for each load using the given power and PF, and then add them vectorially to get the source phase current.

Wait, let me compute the phase current magnitudes first.

For Load 1:

P1 = 6000 W = 3 * Vph1 * Iph1 * PF1.

So, 6000 = 3 * Vph1 * Iph1 * 0.8.

So, Iph1 = 6000 / (3 * Vph1 * 0.8) = 6000 / (2.4 Vph1) = 2500 / Vph1.

Similarly, the reactive power Q1 = P1 * tan(theta1) = 6000 * tan(36.87 degrees).

Wait, tan(36.87) is 0.75, since 3-4-5 triangle: 3 opposite, 4 adjacent, so tan(theta)= 3/4 = 0.75.

So Q1 = 6000 * 0.75 = 4500 VAR.

Similarly, for Load 2:

P2 = 12,000 W, PF2 = 0.833 leading. So theta2 = arccos(0.833) ≈ 33.56 degrees, but leading, so the current leads the voltage by 33.56 degrees.

S2 = 12,000 / 0.833 ≈ 14,400 VA.

So, Iph2 = S2 / (3 Vph2) = 14,400 / (3 Vph2) = 4800 / Vph2.

Wait, but wait, is the phase voltage Vph the same for both loads? Since they're connected to the same supply, I think Vph1 and Vph2 are the same, Vph.

So, Iph1 = 2500 / Vph, Iph2 = 4800 / Vph.

But the source phase current I_s is the sum of Iph1 and Iph2, considering their angles.

Wait, the source phase current is the vector sum of the two load phase currents in each phase.

But each load's phase current has a certain magnitude and angle.

So, in complex form, Iph1 = Iph1_mag * (cos(theta1) + j sin(theta1)).

Similarly, Iph2 = Iph2_mag * (cos(theta2) - j sin(theta2)), because it's leading, so the angle is negative relative to the voltage.

Wait, wait, in power systems, when the PF is leading, the current leads the voltage, which would mean the angle is negative in the standard (voltage as reference) sense.

So for Load 1, theta1 is 36.87 degrees (current lags voltage), so the current angle is +36.87 degrees.

For Load 2, theta2 is 33.56 degrees leading, so the current angle is -33.56 degrees.

So, the source phase current I_s = Iph1 + Iph2.

But we know that the magnitude of I_s is given as 8 Arms. So the magnitude of the vector sum should be 8.

So, let's represent Iph1 and Iph2 as complex numbers and add them.

Let me compute their real and imaginary parts.

Iph1_mag = 2500 / Vph.

Iph2_mag = 4800 / Vph.

So, Iph1 = Iph1_mag * (cos(36.87) + j sin(36.87)).

cos(36.87) = 0.8, sin(36.87) ≈ 0.6.

So, Iph1 = (2500/Vph) * (0.8 + j 0.6).

Similarly, Iph2 = Iph2_mag * (cos(-33.56) + j sin(-33.56)).

cos(-33.56) = cos(33.56) ≈ 0.833, sin(-33.56) ≈ -0.5556 (since tan(33.56)=0.666, so sin is 2/3 approx).

Wait, wait, 33.56 degrees: tan(theta) = 0.666 (since 0.833 is 5/6, so maybe a 33.56 degrees is in a 5-6-7 triangle or something). Let me calculate it accurately.

Wait, cos(theta2) = 0.8333, which is 5/6. So theta2 = arccos(5/6) ≈ 33.557 degrees.

So, sin(theta2) = sqrt(1 - (25/36)) )= sqrt(11/36) )= sqrt(11)/6 ≈ 0.527.

Wait, wait, let me calculate sin(33.557):

sin(33.557) ≈ 0.5547, because 33 degrees is about 0.5446, 34 is about 0.5592. So 33.557 would be around 0.5547.

So, for Load 2, Iph2 = (4800/Vph) * (0.833 + j (-0.5547)).

Wait, but wait, since the PF is leading, the current leads the voltage, so the angle is negative in the standard reference direction (voltage as reference). So the angle is -33.557 degrees.

So, cos(theta2) = 0.833, sin(theta2) = -0.5547.

So, Iph2 = (4800/Vph) * (0.833 - j 0.5547).

Now, adding Iph1 and Iph2:

I_s = Iph1 + Iph2.

Let me write this in terms of real and imaginary parts.

Real part: (2500/Vph)(0.8) + (4800/Vph)(0.833) = [ (2000) + (4000 * 0.833) ] / Vph.

Wait, 2500 * 0.8 = 2000, 4800 * 0.833 ≈ 4000 * (0.833) is 3332, but wait 4800 is 4.8 * 1000, 4.8 * 0.833 ≈ 4.8 * 5/6 = 4.8 * 0.8333 ≈ 4.

Wait, 4800 * 0.833 = (4000 * 0.833) + (800 * 0.833) = 3332 + 666.4 = 3998.4.

Wait, wait, 0.833 is 5/6, so 4800 * 5/6 = 4000.

Wait, 4800 * 5 = 24,000; 24,000 /6 = 4,000. So yes, 4000.

So real part: (2000 + 4000) / Vph = 6000 / Vph.

Imaginary part: (2500/Vph)(0.6) + (4800/Vph)(-0.5547).

Calculate each term:

2500 * 0.6 = 1500.

4800 * (-0.5547) ≈ -2662.56.

So, imaginary part: (1500 - 2662.56) / Vph ≈ (-1162.56)/Vph.

So, I_s has a real part of 6000/Vph and an imaginary part of (-1162.56)/Vph.

The magnitude of I_s is sqrt( (6000/Vph)^2 + (1162.56/Vph)^2 ) = [ sqrt(6000² + 1162.56²) ] / Vph.

Compute 6000² = 36,000,000.

1162.56² ≈ Let's compute 1162.56^2:

Approximate: (1160)^2 = 1,345,600. 2.56^2 is small, but let's do it more accurately.

Alternatively, 1162.56 = 1162 + 0.56.

(1162.56)^2 = (1162)^2 + 2*1162*0.56 + (0.56)^2.

1162^2: 1162 * 1162. Let me compute 1000*1000=1,000,000; 162*1000=162,000; 1000*162=162,000; 162^2=26,244. So 1,000,000 + 162,000 + 162,000 + 26,244 = 1,350,244.

Then 2*1162*0.56 = 2*1162=2324; 2324 * 0.56 ≈ 1300.44.

(0.56)^2=0.3136.

So total ≈ 1,350,244 + 1300.44 + 0.3136 ≈ 1,351,544.75.

So 6000² + 1162.56² ≈ 36,000,000 +
