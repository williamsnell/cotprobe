Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says that a chemist mixes nitric oxide (NO) and bromine (Br2) to form nitrosyl bromide (NOBr) at 298 K. The reaction equation is 2 NO(g) + Br2(g) ⇌ 2 NOBr(g), and the equilibrium constant K is given as 100. The initial pressure of each reactant is 1 atm. The question is asking how much nitrosyl bromide is formed. The options are all in grams, so I'll need to calculate the mass somehow.

Hmm, I remember that for chemical equilibrium problems, I should probably use an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) to find the concentrations or partial pressures at equilibrium. Since the reaction is in the gas phase, partial pressures are probably the way to go here.

Let me start by setting up the ICE table. The initial pressures of NO and Br2 are each 1 atm, and NOBr starts at 0 since it's the product being formed.

So the ICE table would look something like this:

Initial:
[NO] = 1 atm
[Br2] = 1 atm
[NOBr] = 0 atm

Change:
Let me think about the changes. The reaction is 2 NO + Br2 → 2 NOBr. So for every 2 moles of NO consumed, 1 mole of Br2 is consumed, and 2 moles of NOBr are produced. 

Let me let the change for Br2 be -x. Then, the change for NO would be -2x (because the stoichiometric coefficient is 2), and the change for NOBr would be +2x.

Wait, no, wait. The stoichiometric coefficients are 2 for NO and 1 for Br2, and 2 for NOBr. So for each mole of Br2 that reacts, 2 moles of NO react, and 2 moles of NOBr form. So yes, so if I let the change in Br2 be -x, then NO changes by -2x, and NOBr changes by +2x.

So the equilibrium concentrations would be:

[NO] = 1 - 2x
[Br2] = 1 - x
[NOBr] = 0 + 2x = 2x

Now, the equilibrium expression Kp for the reaction is given by the products over reactants, each raised to their stoichiometric coefficients. So Kp = (P_NOBr)^2 / ( (P_NO)^2 * (P_Br2) )

Plugging in the values, we get:

Kp = (2x)^2 / [ (1-2x)^2 * (1 - x) ) ] = 100

So expanding that, (4x²) / [ (1-2x)^2 (1-x) ) ] = 100

Wait, that's a bit complicated. Let me write it as:

4x² = 100 * (1-2x)^2 (1 - x)

Hmm, but solving this equation for x might get a bit tricky because it's a cubic equation. Let me think about possible simplifications or assumptions.

Wait, K is 100, which is a large value. That suggests that the reaction favors the products, so x should be significant. So maybe the assumption that x is small doesn't hold here. So I can't make the assumption that 1-2x ≈ 1 or 1-x ≈ 1. I'll have to solve it without approximations.

So let's expand the denominator. Let's compute (1-2x)^2 first:

(1-2x)^2 = 1 - 4x +4x²

So the denominator becomes (1-4x +4x²)(1 - x) = let's multiply these two:

Multiply term by term:

1*(1 - x) = 1 - x
(-4x)*(1 - x) = -4x +4x²
4x²*(1 - x) =4x² -4x³

So adding them all together:

1 - x -4x +4x² +4x² -4x³

Combine like terms:

1 -5x +8x² -4x³

So now, the equation is:

4x² = 100 * (1 -5x +8x² -4x³)

Expanding the right side:

100*(1) =100
100*(-5x) = -500x
100*(8x²) = 800x²
100*(-4x³) = -400x³

So the equation becomes:

4x² = 100 -500x +800x² -400x³

Bring all terms to one side:

0 = 100 -500x +800x² -400x³ -4x²

Wait, no, subtract 4x² from both sides:

4x² -4x² = ... Wait, no. Let me rearrange:

4x² = 100 -500x +800x² -400x³

Subtract 4x² from both sides:

0 = 100 -500x + (800x² -4x²) -400x³

Which is:

0 = 100 -500x +796x² -400x³

Rearranging in order of descending powers:

-400x³ +796x² -500x +100 =0

Multiply both sides by -1 to make the leading coefficient positive:

400x³ -796x² +500x -100 =0

Hmm, that's a cubic equation. Solving this might be a bit challenging. Let me see if I can factor it or find a real root.

Let me try putting x=1 into the equation:

400*(1)^3 -796*(1)^2 +500*(1) -100 = 400 -796 +500 -100 = (400+500) - (796+100) = 900 - 896 =4, which is not zero.

x=0.5:

400*(0.125) -796*(0.25) +500*(0.5) -100

=50 -199 +250 -100 = (50+250) - (199+100) =300 -299=1, not zero.

x=0.8:

400*(0.512) = 204.8
796*(0.64)= 796 *0.64= let's calculate 800*0.64=512, minus 4*0.64=2.56 → 512-2.56=509.44
500*(0.8)=400
So:

204.8 -509.44 +400 -100 = (204.8 +400) - (509.44 +100) =604.8 -609.44= -4.64, which is negative.

x=0.9:

400*(0.729)=291.6
796*(0.81)= let's compute 800*0.81=648, minus 6*0.81=4.86, so 648-4.86=643.14
500*0.9=450
So equation: 291.6 -643.14 +450 -100 = (291.6 +450)=741.6; 643.14 +100=743.14 → 741.6 -743.14= -1.54.

Hmm, negative. So perhaps the root is between 0.9 and 1. Because at x=1, it's positive 4, and at x=0.9 it's -1.54.

Wait, but let me check x=0.95.

x=0.95:

400*(0.857375)=400 *0.857375 = 342.95
796*(0.9025)= Compute 796 *0.9=716.4; 796*0.0025=1.99; total=716.4+1.99=718.39
500*(0.95)=475
So equation: 342.95 -718.39 +475 -100 = (342.95 +475)=817.95; (718.39 +100)=818.39 → 817.95 -818.39 = -0.44.

Still negative. x=0.96:

400*(0.884736)=400*0.884736≈353.8944
796*(0.9216)= Let's compute 796*(0.9)=716.4, 796*(0.0216)=17.1936 → total≈716.4+17.1936=733.5936
500*0.96=480
So equation: 353.8944 -733.5936 +480 -100 = (353.8944 +480)=833.8944; (733.5936 +100)=833.5936 → 833.8944 -833.5936≈0.3008, which is positive.

So between x=0.95 (value -0.44) and x=0.96 (value +0.3008). The root is between 0.95 and 0.96.

Let me try x=0.955:

x³≈0.955^3≈0.873 (exact: let's compute 0.955^3: 0.955 *0.955 = approx 0.912, then 0.912 * 0.955 ≈0.871.

x²≈0.912.

So:

400x³ ≈400 *0.871≈348.4
796x²≈796 *0.912≈725.472
500x≈500 *0.955=477.5

So equation: 348.4 -725.472 +477.5 -100 = (348.4 +477.5)=825.9; (725.472 +100)=825.472 → 825.9 -825.472≈0.428. Hmm, positive.

Wait, maybe I should try using linear approximation between x=0.95 and x=0.96.

At x=0.95, equation value is -0.44.
At x=0.955, it's +0.428? Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps my calculation for x=0.955 is off. Let me compute more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should use the Newton-Raphson method to find a better approximation.

Let me denote f(x) = 400x³ -796x² +500x -100.

We have f(0.95) = -0.44 (approximated earlier).

Wait, let me calculate f(0.95) more accurately.

x=0.95:

x³ = 0.95 *0.95 *0.95 = 0.857375
x²=0.9025
x=0.95

So f(x)=400*(0.857375) -796*(0.9025) +500*(0.95) -100

= 342.95 - (796 *0.9025) + 475 -100

Compute 796*0.9025:

Let me compute 796 * 0.9 = 716.4
796 * 0.0025=1.99
So 716.4 +1.99=718.39

So f(0.95) =342.95 -718.39 +475 -100

= (342.95 +475) =817.95; (718.39 +100)=818.39 → 817.95 -818.39= -0.44.

At x=0.95, f(x)= -0.44.

At x=0.96, f(x)=400*(0.96)^3 -796*(0.96)^2 +500*(0.96) -100.

Compute each term:

0.96³=0.884736 →400*0.884736=353.8944
0.96²=0.9216 →796*0.9216= let's compute 796*(0.9)=716.4, 796*(0.0216)=17.1936 → total=716.4+17.1936=733.5936
500*0.96=480
So f(x)=353.8944 -733.5936 +480 -100 → sum positive terms: 353.8944 +480=833.8944; sum negative terms:733.5936 +100=833.5936 → 833.8944 -833.5936=0.3008.

So f(0.96)=0.3008.

So between x=0.95 and x=0.96, f(x) changes from -0.44 to +0.3008.

We can use linear approximation to find the root where f(x)=0.

The change in x is 0.01 (from 0.95 to 0.96), and the change in f(x) is 0.3008 - (-0.44)=0.7408.

We want to find delta_x such that f(x) goes from -0.44 to 0, which is a change of +0.44 over the total change of 0.7408 per 0.01 x.

So delta_x = 0.01 * (0.44 / 0.7408) ≈0.01 * 0.594 ≈0.00594.

So the root is approximately at x=0.95 +0.00594=0.95594.

So x≈0.956.

Let me test x=0.956.

Compute f(0.956):

x=0.956.

x³: 0.956^3. Let me compute 0.95^3=0.857375. 0.956 is 0.95 +0.006.

Approximate using binomial expansion: (a + b)^3 ≈a^3 +3a²b +3ab² +b³.

a=0.95, b=0.006.

a³=0.857375.

3a²b=3*(0.9025)*(0.006)=3*0.005415=0.016245.

3ab²=3*(0.95)*(0.006)^2=3*0.95*0.000036=0.0001026.

b³=0.006^3=0.000000216.

So x³≈0.857375 +0.016245=0.87362 +0.0001026=0.8737226 +0.000000216≈0.873723.

So 400x³≈400*0.873723≈349.489.

x²=0.956²=0.914, because 0.95²=0.9025, and 0.006²=0.000036, cross terms: 2*0.95*0.006=0.0114. So 0.95² +0.0114 +0.000036=0.9025+0.0114=0.9139 +0.000036=0.913936.

So 796x²=796*0.913936≈796 *0.9=716.4; 796*0.013936≈796*0.01=7.96; 796*0.003936≈3.136. So total ≈716.4 +7.96 +3.136≈727.496.

500x=500*0.956=478.

So f(x)=400x³ -796x² +500x -100= 349.489 -727.496 +478 -100.

Compute step by step:

349.489 -727.496 = -377.007.

-377.007 +478 =100.993.

100.993 -100=0.993.

Wait, that gives f(x)=0.993, which is positive. But wait, I thought at x=0.956, f(x) would be near zero. Hmm, perhaps my approximation isn't accurate enough because I'm using the binomial expansion, which is only an approximation. Maybe I should compute more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps using Newton-Raphson. Let me try that.

The Newton-Raphson formula is:

x_{n+1} = x_n - f(x_n)/f'(x_n)

We have x0=0.95, f(x0)= -0.44.

Compute f'(x) = 1200x² -1592x +500.

At x=0.95:

f'(0.95)=1200*(0.95)^2 -1592*(0.95) +500.

0.95²=0.9025 → 1200*0.9025=1083.

1592*0.95= let's compute 1500*0.95=1425, 92*0.95=87.4 → total=1425+87.4=1512.4.

So f'(0.95)=1083 -1512.4 +500= (1083+500)=1583 -1512.4=70.6.

So the next iteration:

x1 = 0.95 - (-0.44)/70.6 = 0.95 + 0.44/70.6 ≈0.95 + 0.00623≈0.95623.

Compute f(0.95623). Let's compute more accurately.

x=0.95623.

Compute x³ and x².

x=0.95623.

x²= (0.95623)^2. Let's compute it accurately:

0.95623 * 0.95623:

Compute 0.95 *0.95 = 0.9025.

0.00623 *0.95 = 0.0059165.

0.00623 *0.00623 ≈0.0000388.

So (0.95 +0.00623)^2=0.95² + 2*(0.95)*(0.00623) + (0.00623)^2 ≈0.9025 + 0.011833 +0.0000388≈0.914372.

So x²≈0.914372.

x³= x² * x =0.914372 *0.95623 ≈Let's compute 0.9 *0.95623=0.8606; 0.014372 *0.95623≈0.01375. So total≈0.8606 +0.01375≈0.87435.

Now compute f(x)=400x³ -796x² +500x -100.

400x³=400 *0.87435≈349.74.

796x²=796 *0.914372≈796 *0.9=716.4, 796 *0.014372≈11
