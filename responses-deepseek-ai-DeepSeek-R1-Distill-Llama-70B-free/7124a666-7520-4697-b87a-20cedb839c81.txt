Okay, so I'm trying to solve this limit problem. The question is about finding the limit of f(x) as x approaches c, given that the limit of the absolute value of f(x) is zero. Hmm, let's think about this step by step.

First, I remember that the absolute value of a function, |f(x)|, represents the distance of f(x) from zero on the number line, regardless of direction. So if the limit of |f(x)| as x approaches c is zero, that means as x gets closer to c, f(x) is getting closer to zero in absolute terms.

Wait, but what does that imply about f(x) itself? Well, the absolute value being zero means that the original function must also approach zero. Because absolute value can't be negative, and if it's approaching zero, the function inside can't be approaching anything else but zero. Let me think, does this always hold?

I recall a theorem that says if the limit of |f(x)| as x approaches a point is L, then the limit of f(x) is also L, but only when L is zero. Because if L were positive, |f(x)| approaching L would mean f(x) approaches either L or -L, but when L is zero, both cases collapse to zero.

So in this case, since the limit of |f(x)| is zero, the limit of f(x) must be zero. I don't think there's any scenario where |f(x)| approaches zero but f(x) approaches something else. Because if f(x) approached a positive or negative number, the absolute value would approach the absolute value of that number, not zero. So the only possibility is that f(x) approaches zero.

Looking at the options, option H is 0. So the answer should be H.

The problem involves finding the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches \( c \), given that \( \lim_{x \to c} |f(x)| = 0 \). 

1. The absolute value \( |f(x)| \) represents the distance of \( f(x) \) from zero, so if \( \lim_{x \to c} |f(x)| = 0 \), \( f(x) \) must approach zero as \( x \) approaches \( c \).
2. A theorem confirms that if \( \lim_{x \to c} |f(x)| = 0 \), then \( \lim_{x \to c} f(x) = 0 \). This holds because the absolute value ensures \( f(x) \) cannot approach any value other than zero.
3. Therefore, the limit of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches \( c \) is \( 0 \).

The correct answer is **H: 0**.

Answer: H
