Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about urban models. Hmm, I need to figure out which model it's describing. Let's read the question again carefully.

The question says: Which urban model theorizes that high-rent residential areas grow outward from the center of the city along major highways, with lower-rent inhabitants taking over sequentially. The options are from A to J, each a different model.

Alright, I remember that urban models describe how cities develop and expand. Let me think about the different models I've learned about.

First, the Concentric Zone Model (option E) suggests cities grow in concentric rings. The center is the CBD, then zones for industry, then working-class housing, and so on. But I don't think this is the one because it doesn't specifically mention highways or sequential takeover along roads.

The Sector Model (option D), I think, proposes that cities develop in sectors or wedges. These sectors extend outward from the center along transportation routes like highways. High-rent areas would be along these sectors, and as they expand outward, lower-rent areas take over the inner parts. That sounds a lot like what the question is describing.

Wait, let me make sure. The Sector Model, also known as the Hoyt model, right? It was developed by Homer Hoyt. He suggested that growth occurs along transportation corridors, like highways and rail lines. So high-rent areas follow these lines outward, and as they move out, lower-income groups move into the areas they left behind. That fits the sequential takeover part.

Other models: Ribbon Development (B) refers to building along roads, creating a ribbon-like shape. But I think that's more about the physical pattern along a road, not necessarily the socioeconomic progression.

The Multiple Nuclei Model (H) suggests that cities have multiple centers of growth, like different nuclei. So that's not about a single center expanding along highways.

Urban Sprawl (F) is more about the general spreading out of the city, not specific to socioeconomic zones moving along highways.

So, the Sector Model (D) seems to fit. High-rent areas expand outward along highways, lower-rent take over the spaces they vacate. So the correct answer should be D.

The question asks which urban model describes high-rent residential areas growing outward from the city center along major highways, with lower-rent inhabitants sequentially taking over the vacated areas. The Sector Model (option D), also known as the Hoyt model, fits this description. It proposes that cities develop in sectors or wedges extending outward from the center along transportation corridors like highways. High-rent areas expand outward along these routes, and lower-rent groups move into the areas left behind. This matches the sequential takeover described in the question.

Answer: D
