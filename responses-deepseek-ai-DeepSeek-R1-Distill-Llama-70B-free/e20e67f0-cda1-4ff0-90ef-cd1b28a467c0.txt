Question:

A state has a statute prohibiting the sale of cigarettes to any person under the age of 17. Violation of the statute is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not less than $500 or more than $5,000 The state courts have interpreted this statute as a public welfare offense requiring no particular mental state for its violation. As such, this is a strict liability crime whereby culpability is imposed on a defendant for doing the proscribed act. The defendant, a recovering alcoholic, worked as a cashier at a drug store. Late one night while the defendant was working alone, he got the urge to have a drink. He opened a bottle of rum that the store sold and soon began drinking. A short time later, the defendant became inebriated and passed out. Not long thereafter, a 15-year-old girl entered the store to purchase a package of cigarettes. She took a box off the shelf and went to the cashier's counter to pay for them. Seeing the defendant lying on the floor, unconscious, the girl left the exact price for the cigarettes on the countertop and left the store. If the defendant is prosecuted for violating the state statute, he should be found

Options:

A: guilty, because the defendant was in charge of the store at the time of the violation.
B: not guilty, because the defendant's employer is vicariously liable for the violation that occurred.
C: not guilty, because the defendant did not physically sell the cigarettes to the girl.
D: not guilty, because the defendant did not receive any money for the cigarettes.
E: not guilty, because the defendant was unconscious.
F: not guilty, because the girl took the cigarettes without the defendant's knowledge.
G: guilty, because the 15-year-old girl should have been denied service.
H: guilty, because the defendant left the cigarettes in an accessible place.
I: guilty, because the defendant's intoxication was voluntaiy.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this law question. Let's see what the question is about. Alright, the scenario is about a state statute that prohibits selling cigarettes to anyone under 17. The violation is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine. The state courts have interpreted this as a public welfare offense, meaning it's a strict liability crime. So, strict liability means that the defendant doesn't need to have a particular mental state; just committing the act is enough for guilt.

The defendant is a recovering alcoholic working as a cashier. One night, he's working alone and gets the urge to drink. He opens a rum bottle, starts drinking, becomes inebriated, and passes out. Then a 15-year-old girl comes in to buy cigarettes. She takes a box, goes to the counter, sees the defendant unconscious, leaves the money, and leaves. The question is whether the defendant is guilty of violating the statute.

So, the key points here are that the crime is strict liability. In strict liability crimes, the defendant's intent or knowledge isn't a defense. It's about whether the prohibited act was committed, regardless of the defendant's state of mind.

Let's break down what happened. The defendant was working but got drunk and passed out. The girl took the cigarettes and left the money. So, the question is whether the defendant's actions (or inactions) constitute a violation.

Wait, but the statute prohibits selling cigarettes to minors. The defendant was unconscious, so he didn't actively sell them. But since it's strict liability, maybe just making the cigarettes available could be enough? Or does the sale require an action by the seller?

I remember that in some cases, if a store is left unattended and a minor takes the cigarettes, the owner might be held liable because they didn't take proper measures to prevent the sale. But in this case, the defendant was the cashier on duty. He was supposed to be selling, but he was passed out. The girl took the cigarettes and left the money.

So, the defendant didn't perform the act of selling. The girl took the cigarettes without him doing anything. But does the statute require the act of sale, or is having the cigarettes accessible enough?

Wait, the statute says "sale," which typically involves an exchangeâ€”like the seller giving the product and the buyer giving money. But in this case, the defendant wasn't involved in the transaction. The girl took the cigarettes and left the money. So, technically, there was no sale because the defendant didn't participate.

But since it's strict liability, maybe it's enough that the cigarettes were sold from the store when the defendant was in charge, even if he was unconscious. Or maybe the mere fact that a minor obtained cigarettes from the store is enough.

Alternatively, maybe the fact that the defendant was intoxicated and couldn't prevent the sale is irrelevant because strict liability doesn't care about intent or ability to control the situation.

Looking at the answer options:

Option A says guilty because he was in charge. That might make sense if being in charge makes him responsible, but if he was unconscious, maybe he couldn't have prevented it.

Option E says not guilty because he was unconscious. But strict liability doesn't require consciousness, so maybe that's not a valid defense.

Option C says not guilty because he didn't physically sell them. That might be a point because the sale requires an action, but I'm not sure if the statute requires the seller's active participation.

Option H says guilty because he left the cigarettes accessible. That could be a point, but the statute is about selling, not about making them accessible.

So, I'm a bit torn. On one hand, the defendant didn't actively sell the cigarettes; he was passed out. On the other hand, as the person in charge, maybe he's responsible for any sales that occur while he's on duty, even if he wasn't awake.

Wait, the statute prohibits the sale, so the actus reus is the sale. If the sale happened without the defendant's involvement, then maybe he didn't commit the actus reus. But in strict liability, sometimes just being in a position of responsibility can make you liable.

Alternatively, some cases hold that if a minor takes the cigarettes without the seller's knowledge or action, the seller isn't liable because there's no sale. But I'm not sure about that in strict liability contexts.

I think in this case, since the defendant was unconscious and didn't perform any act of selling, the sale didn't actually occur through his actions. The girl took the cigarettes herself, so perhaps there was no sale. Therefore, the defendant didn't violate the statute because he didn't sell the cigarettes; the girl took them without his involvement.

So, looking at the options, option C says not guilty because he didn't physically sell them. That seems to fit. Alternatively, option E says not guilty because he was unconscious, but I think the better reason is that there was no sale by him.

Wait, but the girl did take the cigarettes, and under the statute, does that count as a sale? Or does a sale require the seller to actively provide the cigarettes?

I think a sale would require some action by the seller, like ringing up the purchase. Since the defendant was passed out, he didn't do that. The girl just took the cigarettes and left the money. So, maybe no sale occurred because the transaction wasn't completed by the seller.

Therefore, the defendant didn't commit the act prohibited by the statute, so he shouldn't be found guilty. So the answer would be C or E.

Wait, but some might argue that leaving the store unattended or the cigarettes accessible could constitute the act, but I'm not sure that's sufficient. The statute is about selling, not about making available.

So, I'm leaning towards option C: not guilty because he didn't physically sell the cigarettes.

The question revolves around whether the defendant, a cashier who became unconscious due to voluntary intoxication, can be held liable under a strict liability statute for selling cigarettes to a minor. The statute prohibits the sale of cigarettes to anyone under 17, and the state courts have interpreted it as a strict liability offense, meaning no particular mental state is required for guilt. The key issue is whether the defendant's actions (or inactions) constitute a violation of the statute.

The defendant, while working alone, became intoxicated and passed out. A 15-year-old girl entered the store, took cigarettes, and left the exact price on the counter without the defendant's involvement. The defendant did not actively sell the cigarettes, as he was unconscious and did not participate in the transaction. The analysis focuses on whether the statute requires an active sale by the defendant or if merely being in charge of the store is sufficient for liability.

Strict liability crimes typically require the commission of the prohibited act (actus reus) without regard to the defendant's mental state. Here, the prohibited act is the "sale" of cigarettes to a minor. A "sale" generally involves an active transaction between the seller and buyer, such as the seller providing the product and the buyer paying for it. In this case, the defendant was unconscious and did not perform any act of selling the cigarettes. The girl took the cigarettes and left the money without the defendant's involvement, which does not constitute a sale in the traditional sense.

Options A and H suggest guilt based on the defendant being in charge or leaving the cigarettes accessible, but these arguments do not align with the statutory requirement of a "sale." Option E argues that the defendant's unconsciousness precludes guilt, but strict liability does not consider the defendant's state of mind. The stronger argument is that the defendant did not physically sell the cigarettes, as required by the statute.

Therefore, the defendant should not be found guilty because he did not physically sell the cigarettes to the girl.
