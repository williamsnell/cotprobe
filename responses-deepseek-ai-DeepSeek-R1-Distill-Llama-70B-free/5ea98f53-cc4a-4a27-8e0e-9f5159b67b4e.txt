Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a boat and a bottle in a river. Hmm, let me try to visualize it. So the boat is going upstream, right? It's moving at a constant speed v relative to the water, but the current is against it. Then, when the boat starts upstream, someone drops a bottle over the side. After 15 minutes, the boat turns around and heads downstream. Eventually, the boat catches up with the bottle when the bottle has drifted one mile downstream from where it was dropped. I need to find the speed of the current.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the setup. Let me think step by step. So, the boat is moving upstream, so its speed relative to the ground (or the riverbank) would be v minus the current, right? Because the current is slowing it down. But wait, no, wait. Wait, the boat's speed is given as v with respect to the water. So when it's going upstream, the ground speed is v - current. And when it's going downstream, the ground speed is v + current. Got it.

Now, the bottle is dropped. So when the bottle is in the water, it's moving at the speed of the current, right? Because it's just floating with the water. So the bottle's speed is the same as the river's current.

So, the boat goes upstream for 15 minutes, then turns around. Let me think about the time. 15 minutes is a quarter of an hour, so 0.25 hours. Then, the boat turns around and starts going downstream. Eventually, the boat catches up to the bottle, and at that point, the bottle has drifted one mile downstream from where it was dropped.

Wait, so the bottle has moved one mile downstream. That means the time it took for the bottle to float that mile is the same as the total time the boat was traveling upstream plus the time it took to come back downstream. But wait, the boat didn't spend the entire time going upstream; it turned around after 15 minutes. So the bottle starts moving downstream immediately when it's dropped, while the boat is going upstream for 15 minutes, then turns around.

Let me break it down into parts. Let's denote the current's speed as c (in miles per hour). The bottle's speed is c, so the time it takes to drift one mile is t_total = 1 mile / c hours.

As for the boat, during the first 15 minutes (which is 0.25 hours), it's moving upstream. Its ground speed upstream is v - c. So the distance it covers upstream in that time is (v - c) * 0.25 miles.

Then, the boat turns around and starts going downstream. Its ground speed downstream is v + c. The distance it needs to cover downstream to catch up with the bottle is... well, let me think. When the boat turns around, the bottle is already a certain distance downstream. Because the bottle has been floating for 0.25 hours. So in those 15 minutes, the bottle has moved c * 0.25 miles downstream.

Wait, no. Wait. When the boat turns around, the bottle has been in the water for 15 minutes. So the bottle's position at that time is c * 0.25 miles downstream from the drop point. So when the boat starts going downstream, the bottle is ahead by that distance, and both are moving downstream.

Wait, but the boat is going to catch up with the bottle. So the distance the boat needs to cover downstream is the distance it went upstream plus the distance the bottle floated during the entire time. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating it.

Let me try to model this with equations. When the boat catches up with the bottle, the total time that has passed since the bottle was dropped is t_total, which is the 15 minutes upstream plus the time it took to come downstream. Let me denote the downstream time as t2. So t_total = 0.25 + t2.

In that time t_total, the bottle has floated one mile downstream, so:

t_total * c = 1 mile.

But since t_total is 0.25 + t2, and t2 is the time the boat took to come downstream, let's think about the boat's movement during t2.

During t2, the boat is moving downstream at speed (v + c). The distance the boat covers during t2 is (v + c) * t2.

But where is the boat when it turns around? It went upstream 0.25 hours at speed (v - c), so the distance upstream is (v - c) * 0.25. So when it turns around, it's (v - c)*0.25 miles upstream from the drop point.

Wait, no. Wait, the drop point is where the bottle was released. So when the boat starts upstream, it moves away from the drop point. Then, after 15 minutes, it turns around. So the boat's position at the turnaround is (v - c)*0.25 miles upstream from the drop point. So when it turns around, it's that far upstream.

Now, the boat needs to catch up with the bottle. The bottle is at position (c * t_total) downstream from the drop point. But the boat is at (v - c)*0.25 upstream, so the distance between the boat and the bottle when the boat turns around is: (v - c)*0.25 + c*(0.25).

Wait, because the bottle is c * 0.25 downstream, and the boat is (v - c)*0.25 upstream. So the separation is (v - c)*0.25 + c*0.25 = v * 0.25.

Ah, because (v - c + c) is v, so 0.25 v. So when the boat turns around, the distance between the boat and the bottle is (0.25 v) miles. Because the boat is 0.25(v - c) upstream, but the bottle is 0.25 c downstream. So the total separation is 0.25(v - c) + 0.25 c = 0.25 v.

Wait, but that's not correct. Because the bottle is moving downstream, and the boat is upstream. So the initial separation when the boat turns around is the distance the boat went upstream plus the distance the bottle went downstream in those 15 minutes.

So boat upstream distance: (v - c) * 0.25.

Bottle downstream distance: c * 0.25.

So separation is (v - c)*0.25 + c *0.25 = (v - c + c ) * 0.25 = v * 0.25.

So yes, the boat is 0.25 v miles behind the bottle when it turns around. Now, the boat needs to cover this distance while moving downstream, and during the same time, the bottle is moving further downstream.

So during the time t2 that the boat is going downstream, it's moving at speed (v + c), and the bottle is moving at c.

So the relative speed between the boat and the bottle is (v + c) - c = v.

So the separation is 0.25 v, and the relative speed is v, so time to catch up is (0.25 v) / v = 0.25 hours, which is 15 minutes. So t2 is 0.25 hours.

Wait, that's interesting. So the time upstream is 15 minutes, and the time downstream is also 15 minutes. So the total time t_total is 0.5 hours (30 minutes).

But wait, earlier I thought that t_total was 0.25 + t2. So if t2 is 0.25, then t_total is 0.5 hours.

But the bottle has drifted one mile in that time, so:

c * t_total = 1 mile.

t_total is 0.5 hours, so:

c * 0.5 = 1 => c = 2 miles per hour.

Wait, that's straightforward. So the current is 2 mph.

Looking at the options, option A is 2 mph. So the answer would be A.

But wait, let me check if I made any wrong assumptions. Let me go through the steps again.

1. Boat goes upstream for 15 minutes (0.25 hours) at speed (v - c), covering distance d1 = (v - c) * 0.25.

2. Bottle, during this time, goes downstream distance d_bottle1 = c * 0.25.

So separation when boat turns around is d1 + d_bottle1 = (v -c)*0.25 + c *0.25 = v * 0.25.

3. Boat turns around, now going downstream at (v + c). Bottle continues downstream at c.

Relative speed between boat and bottle is (v + c) - c = v.

So time to catch up is separation / relative speed = (0.25 v ) / v = 0.25 hours.

4. So total time since the bottle was dropped is 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5 hours.

In that time, the bottle has moved 1 mile: c * 0.5 = 1 â†’ c = 2 mph.

Yes, that makes sense. So the current speed is 2 mph, which is option A. I think that's correct.

To solve the problem, we analyze the motion of the boat and the bottle in the river. The boat travels upstream for 15 minutes (0.25 hours) at a speed of \( v - c \), where \( v \) is the boat's speed relative to the water and \( c \) is the speed of the current. During this time, the bottle, which floats with the current, moves downstream at a speed of \( c \).

### Step 1: Distance covered before the boat turns around
- The boat travels upstream for 0.25 hours, covering a distance:
  \[
  \text{Distance upstream} = (v - c) \cdot 0.25
  \]
- The bottle drifts downstream for the same 0.25 hours, covering a distance:
  \[
  \text{Distance downstream (bottle)} = c \cdot 0.25
  \]
- The separation between the boat and the bottle when the boat turns around is the sum of these distances:
  \[
  \text{Separation} = (v - c) \cdot 0.25 + c \cdot 0.25 = v \cdot 0.25
  \]

### Step 2: Catching up downstream
When the boat turns around, it travels downstream at a speed of \( v + c \), while the bottle continues to drift downstream at \( c \). The relative speed between the boat and the bottle is:
\[
\text{Relative speed} = (v + c) - c = v
\]
The time it takes for the boat to catch up to the bottle is the separation divided by the relative speed:
\[
\text{Time to catch up} = \frac{\text{Separation}}{\text{Relative speed}} = \frac{v \cdot 0.25}{v} = 0.25 \, \text{hours (15 minutes)}.
\]

### Step 3: Total time and current speed
The total time elapsed from when the bottle was dropped until the boat catches up is:
\[
\text{Total time} = 0.25 \, \text{hours (upstream)} + 0.25 \, \text{hours (downstream)} = 0.5 \, \text{hours}.
\]
During this total time, the bottle drifts 1 mile downstream. Using the relationship:
\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \cdot \text{Time},
\]
we find the current speed:
\[
c \cdot 0.5 = 1 \implies c = \frac{1}{0.5} = 2 \, \text{miles per hour}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The speed of the current is **2 miles per hour**, which corresponds to option **A**.
