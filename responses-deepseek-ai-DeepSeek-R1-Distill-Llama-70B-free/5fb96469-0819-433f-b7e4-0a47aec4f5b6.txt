Question:

In an experiment, the first cleavage plane of an amphibian zygote was manipulated so that the gray crescent was contained in only one of the two blastomeres that result from the first cleavage. The two blastomeres were then separated. What is the expected fate of the blastomeres?

Options:

A: Both blastomeres will form incomplete embryos.
B: The blastomere without the gray crescent will form a complete, but small, embryo.
C: The blastomere with the gray crescent will grow in size more quickly than the one without the gray crescent.
D: The blastomere without the gray crescent will stop dividing and die before the second cleavage.
E: The blastomere with the gray crescent will form an abnormal embryo.
F: The blastomere with the gray crescent will form a complete, but small, embryo.
G: The blastomere without the gray crescent will form a complete, but abnormal, embryo.
H: The blastomere without the gray crescent will grow in size more quickly than the one with the gray crescent.
I: Both blastomeres will grow at the same rate.
J: The blastomere with the gray crescent will stop dividing and die before the second cleavage.

Okay, so I've got this question about amphibian embryology, specifically about the gray crescent and its role in cleavage. Hmm, I need to think through what I remember about this.

So, the question says that the first cleavage plane was manipulated so that the gray crescent is only in one of the two blastomeres. Then they separate them. What happens? I remember that the gray crescent is important in the development of the embryo, especially in determining the embryo's polarity and the future development of structures.

Wait, the gray crescent forms opposite the sperm entry point, right? It's involved in the dorsal-ventral axis formation. Oh yeah, and it's crucial for the differentiation of cells into various tissues and organs.

In normal development, the first cleavage divides the zygote into two blastomeres. If the gray crescent is in one, that probably makes that blastomere different from the other. I think the gray crescent is necessary for the development of the organizer region, which is like the Spemann organizer in frogs. Without it, the embryo can't properly form the dorsal structures.

So if they separated the blastomeres, one has the gray crescent and the other doesn't. I think only the one with the gray crescent can develop normally. Because the other one lacks the necessary signals to organize the formation of the embryo.

Wait, but the options say something about forming complete or incomplete embryos. So if a blastomere doesn't have the gray crescent, can it still form an embryo? Or does it fail?

I remember something about experiments where they split the embryo. Like, if you split the embryo into two, each half can form a complete embryo if they each have some gray crescent. But if one doesn't, that half can't form a proper embryo.

So in this case, the blastomere without the gray crescent would not be able to form a normal embryo. It might not develop properly, maybe only forming certain parts or not developing at all. Oh wait, actually, without the gray crescent, the blastomere can't form the organizer, so it can't induce the formation of the dorsal axis. So it might develop abnormally or not at all.

Wait, no, in the classic experiments, when they split the embryo before the first cleavage but made sure each cell had gray crescent, they got twins. But if one doesn't have it, then that one can't form a proper embryo. So in this question, only one blastomere has the gray crescent.

So the one with the gray crescent should be able to form a complete embryo, albeit smaller because it's only half the original zygote. The other one, without the gray crescent, can't form a complete embryo. It might form an incomplete one or not develop properly.

Looking at the options:

Option F says the blastomere with the gray crescent will form a complete, but small, embryo. That makes sense because it has all the necessary components to develop.

Option B says the one without will form a complete but small embryo, which I don't think is right because it lacks the gray crescent. So option B is incorrect.

Option E says the one with the gray crescent forms an abnormal embryo. No, it should form a normal, just smaller one.

So the correct answer should be F.

The gray crescent in amphibian embryos is a critical structure for normal development, particularly in establishing the dorsal-ventral axis and the Spemann organizer, which is essential for proper embryonic differentiation. In this experiment, the first cleavage plane was manipulated so that the gray crescent was contained in only one of the two blastomeres, which were then separated.

The blastomere containing the gray crescent has the necessary components to develop into a complete, albeit smaller, embryo. This is because it retains the organizer region required for proper dorsal axis formation and subsequent development. On the other hand, the blastomere without the gray crescent lacks these critical components, making it unable to form a complete embryo.

Among the options provided:

- **Option F** correctly states that the blastomere with the gray crescent will form a complete, but small, embryo. This aligns with the understanding that the gray crescent is essential for normal development.
- Other options, such as **B**, **E**, and **J**, are incorrect because they either suggest the blastomere without the gray crescent can form a complete embryo (which it cannot) or incorrectly describe the fate of the blastomere with the gray crescent.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**F: The blastomere with the gray crescent will form a complete, but small, embryo.**

Answer: F
