Okay, so I have this problem here where Owen has blue jeans with a 32-inch waist. The question is asking what his new waist size would be if his waist circumference increases by 15%. I'm supposed to figure this out and choose the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, let's start by understanding what a 15% increase means. I remember that percentage increase is calculated by taking the original number, multiplying it by the percentage, and then adding that to the original. So the formula should be new size = original size + (original size * percentage increase).

Owen's original waist size is 32 inches. The increase is 15%, which is 0.15 in decimal form. So I need to calculate 32 inches multiplied by 0.15 to find the increase.

Let me do that math. 32 times 0.15. Well, 32 times 0.1 is 3.2, and 32 times 0.05 is 1.6. Adding those together, 3.2 + 1.6 equals 4.8 inches. So the increase is 4.8 inches.

Now, add that increase to the original waist size. 32 inches plus 4.8 inches equals 36.8 inches. But wait, the question says to round to the nearest whole inch. So 36.8 is closer to 37 than 36 because 0.8 is more than 0.5. So the new waist size would be approximately 37 inches.

Looking at the options, option J is 37 inches. So the answer must be J.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 15% of 32 is indeed 4.8, right? And 32 + 4.8 is 36.8, which rounds up to 37. Yep, that seems right. So I'm confident the correct answer is J.

The new waist size is calculated by increasing the original 32-inch waist by 15%. 

32 inches * 0.15 = 4.8 inches. Adding this to the original size: 32 + 4.8 = 36.8 inches. Rounded to the nearest whole inch, this is 37 inches.

The correct answer is J: 37 inches.
