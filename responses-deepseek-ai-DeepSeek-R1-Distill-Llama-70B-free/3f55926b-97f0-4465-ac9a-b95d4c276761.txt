Okay, so I have this initial value problem to solve. The equation is y' + (1/4)y = 3 + 2 cos(2t), with the initial condition y(0)=0. I need to find the value of t where the solution first intersects y=12. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that this is a linear first-order differential equation. The standard form for such equations is y' + P(t)y = Q(t). So in this case, P(t) is 1/4, and Q(t) is 3 + 2cos(2t). 

To solve this, I should use an integrating factor. The integrating factor mu(t) is usually e raised to the integral of P(t) dt. So integrating (1/4) dt gives (1/4)t, and the integrating factor becomes e^(t/4).

Multiplying both sides of the equation by the integrating factor should make the left side the derivative of (mu(t) y). Let me write that out:

e^(t/4) y' + (1/4)e^(t/4) y = (3 + 2 cos(2t)) e^(t/4).

The left side is now d/dt [e^(t/4) y]. So I can integrate both sides with respect to t to find e^(t/4) y.

Integrating the left side is straightforward; it's just the integral of the derivative, which gives e^(t/4) y evaluated from 0 to t. On the right side, I need to compute the integral of (3 + 2 cos(2t)) e^(t/4) dt. Hmm, that integral might be a bit tricky.

Let me split the integral into two parts: the integral of 3 e^(t/4) dt plus the integral of 2 cos(2t) e^(t/4) dt.

Starting with the first part: integral of 3 e^(t/4) dt. Let u = t/4, so du = dt/4, dt = 4 du. So the integral becomes 3 * 4 ∫ e^u du = 12 e^u + C = 12 e^(t/4) + C.

Now the second part: integral of 2 cos(2t) e^(t/4) dt. Hmm, this looks like it would require integration by parts. Let me set u = e^(t/4), dv = 2 cos(2t) dt. Wait, maybe it's better to use a different approach. Alternatively, I can use the formula for integrating e^{at} cos(bt) dt, which I think is a standard integral.

The formula I remember is ∫ e^{at} cos(bt) dt = e^{at} (a cos(bt) + b sin(bt)) ) / (a² + b²) ) + C.

Wait, let me double-check that. I think more accurately, the integral is e^{at} [ a cos(bt) + b sin(bt) ] / (a² + b²). So in our case, a is 1/4, and b is 2.

Wait, no, in this case, our integral is 2 cos(2t) e^(t/4), so the 2 is a coefficient. So let me write it as 2 ∫ e^{(1/4)t} cos(2t) dt.

Using the formula, the integral would be 2 * [ e^{(1/4)t} ( (1/4) cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t) ) ) / ( (1/4)^2 + (2)^2 ) ) ] + C.

Let me compute the denominator: (1/4)^2 + (2)^2 = 1/16 + 4 = (1 + 64)/16 = 65/16.

So the integral becomes 2 * [ e^(t/4) ( (1/4) cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t) ) ) * (16/65) ) ] + C.

Simplify that: 2 * (16/65) = 32/65. So the integral is (32/65) e^(t/4) [ (1/4) cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t) ) ] + C.

Wait, let me compute this more carefully. Let me compute the numerator inside the brackets:

(1/4) cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t).

So putting it all together, the integral is (32/65) e^(t/4) [ (1/4 cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t) ) ] + C.

So combining both integrals, the right side overall is:

12 e^(t/4) + (32/65) e^(t/4) [ (1/4 cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t) ) ] + C.

Wait, no, because the initial integral was split into two parts: 3 e^(t/4) and 2 cos(2t) e^(t/4). So the entire right side integral is:

12 e^(t/4) + (32/65) e^(t/4) [ (1/4 cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t) ) ] + C.

But wait, when I put it all together, the solution for y is obtained by dividing by the integrating factor. Let me write:

e^(t/4) y = ∫ [3 + 2 cos(2t)] e^(t/4) dt = 12 e^(t/4) + (32/65) e^(t/4) [ (1/4 cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t) ) ] + C.

Wait, no, because when I integrated 3 e^(t/4), I got 12 e^(t/4). Then the integral of 2 cos(2t) e^(t/4) is (32/65) e^(t/4) [ (1/4 cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t) ) ] as above.

So combining them, the integral is:

12 e^(t/4) + (32/65) e^(t/4) [ (1/4 cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t) ) ] + C.

But wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the coefficients. Let me recheck the integration steps.

So, for the 3 e^(t/4) part: integral is 3 * 4 e^(t/4) = 12 e^(t/4), correct.

For the 2 cos(2t) e^(t/4) part: let me redo that.

Using the formula ∫ e^{at} cos(bt) dt = e^{at} (a cos(bt) + b sin(bt)) / (a² + b²).

So a = 1/4, b = 2. So the integral is e^(t/4) [ ( (1/4) cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t) ) / ( (1/4)^2 + (2)^2 ) ) ] * 2, because the original term is 2 cos(2t) e^(t/4).

So denominator is (1/16 + 4) = (1 + 64)/16 = 65/16.

So the integral becomes 2 * e^(t/4) [ (1/4 cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t) ) ] / (65/16) ) = 2 * (16/65) e^(t/4) [ (1/4 cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t) ) ].

So 2 * 16 = 32, so it's (32/65) e^(t/4) [ (1/4 cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t) ) ].

So the integral of 2 cos(2t) e^(t/4) is (32/65) e^(t/4) [ (1/4 cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t) ) ].

So putting it all together, the integral is:

12 e^(t/4) + (32/65) e^(t/4) [ (1/4 cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t) ) ] + C.

Wait, but when I integrated, the entire right-hand side is that, so when I write e^(t/4) y = 12 e^(t/4) + (32/65) e^(t/4) [ (1/4 cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t) ) ] + C.

Then I can factor out e^(t/4):

e^(t/4) y = e^(t/4) [ 12 + (32/65)(1/4 cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t) ) ] + C.

Wait, no, because the integral was of (3+2 cos(2t)) e^(t/4) dt, so when I integrate, it's the sum of the two integrals, which are 12 e^(t/4) and (32/65) e^(t/4) (1/4 cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t) ). So when I write e^(t/4) y, it's equal to that sum plus C, and then I can factor e^(t/4) as:

e^(t/4) y = e^(t/4) [12 + (32/65)(1/4 cos(2t) + 2 sin(2t) ) ] + C.

Wait, no, no, I think I messed up the combining. Let me write it again.

The integral is 12 e^(t/4) + (32/65) e^(t/4) (1/4 cos 2t + 2 sin 2t) + C.

So e^(t/4) y = 12 e^(t/4) + (32/65) e^(t/4) (1/4 cos 2t + 2 sin 2t) + C.

Then, to solve for y, divide both sides by e^(t/4):

y = 12 + (32/65)(1/4 cos 2t + 2 sin 2t) + C e^(-t/4).

Now, apply the initial condition y(0) = 0. Let's plug t=0 into this equation.

At t=0, cos(0)=1, sin(0)=0. So:

y(0) = 12 + (32/65)(1/4 * 1 + 2 * 0 ) + C e^(0) = 12 + (32/65)(1/4) + C = 0.

Compute (32/65)(1/4) = 8/65.

So 12 + 8/65 + C = 0.

So C = -12 - 8/65.

Convert 12 to 65ths: 12 = 780/65. So 780/65 + 8/65 = 788/65. So C = -788/65.

So the solution is:

y = 12 + (32/65)(1/4 cos 2t + 2 sin 2t) - (788/65) e^(-t/4).

Simplify the terms. Let me compute the coefficients:

32/65 * 1/4 = 8/65, and 32/65 * 2 = 64/65.

So y = 12 + (8/65 cos 2t + 64/65 sin 2t) - (788/65) e^(-t/4).

Alternatively, that can be written as:

y(t) = 12 + (8 cos 2t + 64 sin 2t)/65 - (788/65) e^(-t/4).

Now, I need to find the first time t where y(t) = 12. So I set y(t) = 12 and solve for t.

So:

12 + (8 cos 2t + 64 sin 2t)/65 - (788/65) e^(-t/4) = 12.

Subtract 12 from both sides:

(8 cos 2t + 64 sin 2t)/65 - (788/65) e^(-t/4) = 0.

Multiply both sides by 65 to eliminate denominators:

8 cos 2t + 64 sin 2t - 788 e^(-t/4) = 0.

So the equation becomes:

8 cos 2t + 64 sin 2t = 788 e^(-t/4).

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated. Maybe I can express the left side as a single sinusoidal function. Let me see.

The left side is 8 cos 2t + 64 sin 2t. Let me factor out 8:

8 [ cos 2t + 8 sin 2t ].

But perhaps a better approach is to express this as R cos(2t - φ), where R is the amplitude and φ is the phase shift.

The general formula is A cos θ + B sin θ = R cos(θ - φ), where R = sqrt(A² + B²), and tan φ = B/A.

Here, A = 8, B = 64. So R = sqrt(8² + 64²) = sqrt(64 + 4096) = sqrt(4160). Let me compute that: 4160 = 16 * 260, so sqrt(16*260) = 4 sqrt(260). 260 can be broken down into 4*65, so sqrt(260)=2 sqrt(65). So R = 4 * 2 sqrt(65) = 8 sqrt(65).

Wait, let's compute R more carefully:

8² = 64.

64² = 4096.

64 + 4096 = 4160.

sqrt(4160) = sqrt(16 * 260) = 4 sqrt(260).

sqrt(260) can be sqrt(4*65) = 2 sqrt(65), so sqrt(260) = 2 sqrt(65).

Thus, R = 4 * 2 sqrt(65) = 8 sqrt(65).

Now, tan φ = B/A = 64/8 = 8. So φ = arctan(8). Let me compute that in terms of radians.

So, 8 cos 2t + 64 sin 2t = 8 sqrt(65) cos(2t - φ), where φ = arctan(8).

So the equation becomes:

8 sqrt(65) cos(2t - φ) = 788 e^(-t/4).

Hmm, this might not be much easier, but perhaps I can write it as:

cos(2t - φ) = (788 / (8 sqrt(65))) e^(-t/4).

Compute 788/(8 sqrt(65)):

788 divided by 8 is 98.5.

sqrt(65) is approximately 8.0623.

So 98.5 / 8.0623 ≈ 12.21.

Wait, let me compute more accurately:

sqrt(65) ≈ 8.062257748.

788 ÷ 8 = 98.5.

98.5 ÷ 8.062257748 ≈ Let me compute:

8.062257748 * 12 = 96.7470957.

So 98.5 - 96.7470957 = 1.7529043.

So 12 + (1.7529043 / 8.062257748) ≈ 12 + 0.2175 ≈ 12.2175.

So 788/(8 sqrt(65)) ≈ 12.2175.

So the equation is:

cos(2t - φ) ≈ 12.2175 e^(-t/4).

But wait, the maximum value of cosine is 1, so the right-hand side must be less than or equal to 1. So 12.2175 e^(-t/4) ≤ 1, which implies e^(-t/4) ≤ 1/12.2175 ≈ 0.0819.

Taking natural log on both sides: -t/4 ≤ ln(0.0819) → -t/4 ≤ -2.506 → t/4 ≥ 2.506 → t ≥ 10.024.

Wait, so the solution for t must be greater than or equal to about 10.024. So the first intersection happens somewhere around t ≈ 10.024 or higher.

Wait, but this is an approximation. I can perhaps try using some numerical methods to solve this equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make a substitution. Let me let u = t/4, so t = 4u. Then the equation becomes:

8 cos(8u) + 64 sin(8u) = 788 e^{-u}.

Wait, that might not help much.

Alternatively, maybe I can graph the left-hand side and the right-hand side as functions of t and see where they intersect first.

Wait, but I'm trying to do this analytically, but it's getting complicated. Maybe I can use an iterative method, like Newton-Raphson, to approximate the solution.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make an initial guess and refine it. Let's think about how the functions behave.

As t increases, e^(-t/4) decreases. The left-hand side is 8 cos 2t + 64 sin 2t, which is a periodic function with amplitude sqrt(8^2 +64^2) = sqrt(4160) ≈ 64.5. Wait no, earlier calculation said R was 8 sqrt(65) ≈ 64.0312.

Wait, no, 8^2 + 64^2 = 64 + 4096 = 4160. So sqrt(4160) is sqrt(64*65) = 8 sqrt(65) ≈ 8*8.0623 ≈ 64.498.

So the left-hand side has a maximum of about 64.5 and minimum of about -64.5. The right-hand side is 788 e^(-t/4), which starts at 788 when t=0 and decreases exponentially.

At t=0, left side is 8*1 +64*0=8, right side is 788. So 8 <788, so LHS < RHS. So equation isn't satisfied.

As t increases, RHS decreases. Let's find when RHS becomes less than LHS's maximum. Since LHS can reach up to ~64.5, when does 788 e^(-t/4) = 64.5?

Solve for t:

788 e^(-t/4) = 64.5 →
