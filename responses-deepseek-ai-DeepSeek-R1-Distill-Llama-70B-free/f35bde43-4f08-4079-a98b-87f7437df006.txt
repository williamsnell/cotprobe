Okay, so I've got this question about directed trees and undirected trees. Hmm, I remember that trees are connected acyclic graphs. So the question is asking how many distinct directed trees can be constructed from an undirected tree with 100 nodes. 

Wait, wait. Let me think. I think when you have an undirected tree, each edge can be considered as two possible directed edges because you can assign a direction to each edge. But wait, no, because in a directed tree, the structure has to maintain certain properties. Oh right, a directed tree is a directed graph which would have a root node, and each node except the root has exactly one parent. So for an undirected tree, to make it directed, you have to choose a root, and then direct all edges away from the root (or towards, but I think in this case it's away).

Wait, no, I think more accurately, each edge in the undirected tree has two possible directions. But once a root is chosen, each edge's direction is determined by the parent-child relationship. So the number of possible directed trees would correspond to the number of possible roots you can choose. Because for each root, you get a unique directed tree by directing edges away from the root.

Wait, but wait a second. If the tree has 100 nodes, the number of possible roots is 100. Because any node can be the root. So for each root, you can create exactly one directed tree by assigning directions accordingly. So the total number of distinct directed trees would be equal to the number of nodes, which is 100.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again. An undirected tree doesn't have a root, so when you make it directed, you have to choose a root and assign directions. For each choice of root, you get one directed tree. So if there are 100 nodes, each can be the root once. So the total number of distinct directed trees would be 100. 

Looking at the options, option J is 100. So the answer should be J.

To determine how many distinct directed trees can be constructed from an undirected tree with 100 nodes, we start by understanding the relationship between undirected and directed trees. An undirected tree is a connected acyclic graph, while a directed tree (or arborescence) requires selecting a root node and directing all edges away from it (or towards it, but the direction must be consistent).

For an undirected tree, the process of constructing a directed tree involves two steps:
1. **Choosing a root node**: Any of the 100 nodes in the tree can serve as the root.
2. **Assigning directions to edges**: Once the root is chosen, all edges are directed away from the root, creating a unique directed tree.

Since there are 100 possible choices for the root, each choice results in exactly one distinct directed tree. Therefore, the total number of distinct directed trees is equal to the number of nodes in the undirected tree, which is 100.

From the given options, the correct answer is:

J: 100

Answer: J
