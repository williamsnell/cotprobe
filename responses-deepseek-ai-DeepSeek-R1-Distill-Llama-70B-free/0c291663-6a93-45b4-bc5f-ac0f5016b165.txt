Okay, so I've got this question about model studies of a sea wall. Hmm, I remember that when you do scale models, especially in engineering, you have to consider similarity laws. There are different types like geometric, kinematic, and dynamic similarity.

The problem says the scale is 1:25. So the model is 1 unit and the prototype is 25 units. I think that applies to lengths. But what about time? Oh right, for kinematic similarity, the time scale comes into play with things like wave periods.

Wave period is a time measurement, so I should use the Froude scaling law here because Froude number is about the ratio of inertial to gravitational forces, which is important for waves. Froude scaling says that the model and prototype should have the same Froude number. The Froude number is velocity squared divided by length times gravity, but since we're dealing with periods (time), maybe I need to relate the periods using the scale factor.

Wait, the Froude number (Fr) is also equal to (L/T)^0.5, where L is length and T is period. So for the model and prototype to have the same Fr, the model's (Lm/Tm) should equal prototype's (Lp/Tp), but scaled by the factor.

Wait, or maybe the ratio of velocities squared equals the ratio of lengths times gravity over time. No, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let me think again. The Froude scaling law for time periods: the time scale factor is the square root of the length scale factor. Because when you scale down the model, the time (like period) scales down by the square root of the length scale.

So the length scale is 1:25, so the model is smaller by a factor of 25. The time scale factor would be sqrt(1/25) = 1/5. So the model period Tm is Tp multiplied by 1/5.

Wait, wait. No, wait. If the model is smaller, things happen faster. So if prototype period is 10 seconds, the model period should be 10 * (1/5) = 2 seconds. So the wave generation period in the model should be 2 seconds. That gives the first part of the answer.

Now for the second part: force per foot. Force is part of dynamic similarity. The force scale factor depends on the model's density, gravity, and length scale. But wait, in model studies, usually, the fluid (water) is the same, so the density is the same. So the force scaling is based on the other factors.

Force (F) relates to mass times acceleration. Mass is density * volume, and volume scales with length cubed. Acceleration is length/time squared.

So F_scale = (density) * (length^3) * (length / time^2) ) → since density is same, F_scale is L^3 * (L/T²) )= L^4 / T².

But wait, using Froude, since we're using Froude scaling, the velocity scale is sqrt(L/g * g) → sqrt(L), so V_model = sqrt(L) * V_prototype. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Alternatively, force scaling in Froude models: the force ratio is (rho * L^3 * (V^2 / L)) ) = rho * L^2 * V^2. Wait, but with Froude scaling, V is scaled as V_model = V_prototype * sqrt(L_model / L_prototype). Because Froude number Fr = V/(sqrt(gL)), so V_model = V_prototype * sqrt( (L_model/L_prototype) ).

So substituting, V_model = Vp * sqrt(1/25) = Vp /5.

Then, force in the model Fm = (rho) * (Lm)^2 * (Vm)^2. Because F is proportional to rho L^2 V^2, in dynamic scaling.

So Fm = rho * (Lm)^2 * (Vm)^2. But since Vm = Vp /5, and Lm = Lp /25.

So substituting, Fm = rho * (Lp/25)^2 * (Vp/5)^2 = rho * Lp^2 Vp^2 / (25^2 *5^2) ) = rho Lp^2 Vp^2 / (625 *25) )= rho Lp^2 Vp^2 / 15625.

But the prototype force Fp is rho * Lp^2 * Vp^2. So Fm = Fp / (15625).

Wait, wait. Wait a second, maybe there's a simpler way. Because force scales with (length)^2*(time)^-2. Because in Froude scaling, velocity scales with sqrt(length), so V ~ sqrt(L). So acceleration a = V/T scales as sqrt(L)/T. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, using the fact that in Froude scaling, the force ratio is (Lm/Lp)^2 * (Vm^2 / Vp^2). But since Vm = Vp * sqrt(Lm/Lp), then Vm/Vp = sqrt(1/25) = 1/5.

So (Vm/Vp)^2 = 1/25.

So force ratio Fm/Fp = (1/25)^2 * (1/25) )? No, wait. Wait, perhaps the force scaling is (Lm/Lp)^2 * ( (Vm/Vp) )^2. Because F is proportional to rho * L^2 * V^2, and rho is same.

So Fm/Fp = (Lm/Lp)^2 * (Vm/Vp)^2.

We know Lm/Lp is 1/25, Vm/Vp is 1/5.

So Fm/Fp = (1/25)^2 * (1/5)^2 = (1/625) * (1/25) )= 1/(15625).

But wait wait. Let me double-check. Because Froude scaling says Vm/Vp = sqrt( Lm / Lp ). So with Lm/Lp = 1/25, Vm/Vp = 1/5. So yes.

So Fm = Fp * (1/25)^2 * (1/5)^2 = Fp * (1/(25^2*5^2)) ) = 1/(625 * 25) )= 1/15625.

Wait, but that can't be right because if the model force is 12 lb/ft, then the prototype force would be 12 * 15625 lb/ft. Because Fm = Fp / 15625 → Fp = Fm * 15625.

Wait, wait. Because Fm is the model force. So model force is the prototype force divided by the scale factor.

Because Fm = Fp * (1/15625). So Fp = Fm * 15625.

So in the problem, the model wave force is 12 lb/ft. So Fp = 12 * 15625 lb/ft.

Let me compute that. 12 *15625: 15625 *10 is 156250, 15625*2=31250. So 156250 +31250=187500. Wait no, wait. 15625 *12 = 15625*(10+2)=156250 +31250=187500. So Fp=187500 lb/ft.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have 187500 lb/ft. Hmm, that's a problem. Did I do something wrong?

Wait, perhaps I messed up the force scaling. Let me think again. Maybe I got the scaling factor wrong.

Another approach: in Froude scaling, the force ratio is (Lm/Lp)^2 * (Vm/Vp)^2. Or perhaps it's (Lm/Lp) * (Vm/Vp)^2.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think about the dimensions. Force has units of mass * length / time². Since in Froude scaling, the model uses the same fluid (water), so mass density is same. So mass scales as (Lm/Lp)^3. So force scales as (Lm/Lp)^3 * (1/Tm^2) / (1/Tp^2) ).

Wait, time scaling: Tm = Tp * sqrt(Lm/Lp). So Tm/Tp = 1/5. So Tp =5 Tm.

So 1/Tm² = (1/Tp²) *25.

So force scaling: Fm = (Lm/Lp)^3 * (1/Tm²) / (1/Tp²) ) * Fp → no, wait, perhaps better to write Fm/Fp = (rho_m / rho_p) * (Lm/Lp)^3 * ( (Vm/Vp) )².

Since rho_m = rho_p (same fluid), rho_m/rho_p =1. Vm/Vp = sqrt(Lm/Lp) = 1/5. So (Vm/Vp)^2 = 1/25.

So Fm/Fp = (1/25)^3 * (1/25) )? Wait, no. Wait, the velocity is Vm/Vp=1/5, so (Vm/Vp)^2=1/25. So Fm/Fp = (Lm/Lp)^3 * (Vm/Vp)^2.

Lm/Lp=1/25. So (1/25)^3 is 1/15625. Multiply by (1/25), gives 1/(15625 *25) )= 1/390625. So Fm = Fp * 1/390625.

So Fp = Fm * 390625.

Wait, that would make Fp =12 * 390625 = 4,687,500 lb/ft. But that's way larger than any of the options, which are all under 10,000. So I must have made a mistake.

Hmm, perhaps I used the wrong scaling laws. Maybe I should reconsider. Let me try another approach.

In Froude models, the scaling for force is based on the model's Froude law which states that the forces are proportional to the square of the velocity and the length. But perhaps the correct scaling is Fm = (Lm/Lp)^2 * (Vm/Vp)^2 * Fp.

Wait, the Froude number is Fr= V/(sqrt(gL)), so if Fr is same, then Vm/(sqrt(g Lm)) = Vp/(sqrt(g Lp)) → Vm= Vp * sqrt(Lm/Lp).

So Vm= Vp * (1/5), since Lm/Lp=1/25.

So Vm/Vp=1/5. So (Vm/Vp)^2=1/25.

So Fm/Fp = (Lm/Lp)^2 * (Vm/Vp)^2 = (1/25)^2 * (1/25) )= 1/(25^3)=1/15625.

Thus, Fm= Fp/15625 → Fp= Fm *15625.

So Fm is 12 lb/ft. So Fp=12 *15625= 187500 lb/ft. But none of the options match this. So perhaps I'm using the wrong scaling.

Wait, maybe the force scaling is Fm/Fp = (Lm/Lp)^2 * (rho_m/rho_p) * ( (Vm/Vp)^2 ) / ( (gm/gp) )

But since rho_m= rho_p and gm=gp (same gravity), that term is 1. So the scaling is (Lm/Lp)^2 * (Vm/Vp)^2.

Wait, so that would be (1/25)^2 * (1/5)^2 → (1/625) * (1/25) )=1/(15625). So same as before.

Hmm, but this gives 12 *15625=187500 lb/ft, which isn't any of the options. So I'm confused.

Wait, perhaps the question is using different scaling. Maybe it's not Froude scaling but Reynolds, but I don't think so because waves are typically Froude scaled.

Alternatively, perhaps the force is scaled differently, perhaps considering only the geometric scaling for some components. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: The model is 1:25, so the length is scaled down by 25. So for forces, which depend on mass times acceleration, and mass is density times volume (length^3). So mass scales as (1/25)^3.

Acceleration scales as (length)/(time squared). Time scaling: Since wave period scales as sqrt(length) → model time is 1/5 of prototype. So time squared is (1/5)^2=1/25. So acceleration scales as (1/25) / (1/25)^2 )= (1/25) * (25)^2 )=25. So acceleration scales up by 25.

So force is mass * acceleration. Mass scales down by (1/25)^3, acceleration scales up by 25. So force scales by (1/25^3) *25= 1/(25^2)=1/625.

So Fm=Fp /625. So Fp= Fm *625.

Ah, that's different. So if Fm=12 lb/ft, then Fp=12 *625=7500 lb/ft.

Wait, the first part of the question had the period as 2 seconds, which matched option A, which has period 2 sec and force 7500 lb/ft.

So that would correspond to option A: 2 sec, 7500 lb/ft.

Wait, but let me make sure. So according to this scaling, Fm/Fp=1/625 → Fp=12 *625=7500 lb/ft.

So the period is 2 seconds, and force is 7500 lb/ft. So the correct answer is A.

Wait, but why the discrepancy earlier? Oh because I think when I considered Froude scaling, I included the velocity squared term, but perhaps the correct approach here is to consider the force scaling as (Lm/Lp)^2, since sometimes in coastal engineering, the horizontal force on a structure is considered to scale with L^2. Alternatively, perhaps because the force per unit length (lb/ft) is being considered, which is force per length.

Wait, force per foot would scale as (force)/(length). So if force scales as L^2, then force per length scales as L.

So Fp_per_length = Fm_per_length * (Lp/Lm).

Since Lp=25 Lm, Fp_per_length = Fm_per_length *25.

So in this case, Fm is 12 lb/ft. So Fp=12 lb/ft *25=300 lb/ft. No, that can't be right either.

Wait, perhaps the force per unit length is the quantity here, so perhaps scaling is different.

Alternatively, perhaps for force, Fm = (Lm/Lp)^2 * (rho_m/rho_p) * ( (Vm/Vp)^2 ) * Fp. But I'm getting myself mixed up.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the Buckingham pi theorem. The force on the wall would depend on variables like density (rho), gravity (g), wave height, wave period, and the length of the wall.

But in model studies, using Froude scaling, the ratio of forces is (Lm/Lp)^2.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's try to look for an alternative approach.

Wave force is often modeled using the formula F = (1/2) rho g H^2 L, where H is wave height and L is wavelength. But in scaling, H scales with Lm, and L scales with Lm.

So Fm = (1/2) rho g (Hm)^2 Lm.

Fp = (1/2) rho g (Hp)^2 Lp.

So Fm/Fp = (Hm^2 Lm) / (Hp^2 Lp).

But since Hm = Hp /25 (geometric scaling), and Lm= Lp /25.

So Fm/Fp = ( (Hp/25)^2 * (Lp/25) ) / (Hp^2 Lp) )= ( (Hp^2 /625) * Lp/25 ) / (Hp^2 Lp) )= (1/(625*25)) = 1/15625.

So Fm= Fp /15625. So Fp= Fm *15625. So 12*15625 = 187500 lb/ft. But this isn't matching any options.

Hmm, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the force per foot. Since the original force is per foot, and the length is scaled, maybe the scaling is different.

Wait, the force per foot in the model would correspond to the force per foot in the prototype, scaled by some factor.

If the model is 1:25, then the prototype is 25 times longer. So the force per foot in the model would scale up by 25, because each foot in the model represents 25 feet in the prototype. Wait, that might make sense.

So Fp_per_foot = Fm_per_foot *25.

So if Fm is 12 lb/ft, then Fp is 12 *25=300 lb/ft. But none of the options have 300 lb/ft. So I'm really confused now.

Wait, let me think again. Another approach. For similar models, when you're comparing forces, the scaling factor for force is (Lm/Lp)^2, because force is proportional to pressure (which scales as rho g h, same for model and prototype if Froude) multiplied by area (length squared). So F ~ rho g h L^2. In Froude scaling, h scales with L, so F scales as L^3. Wait, no, because h is scaled as L, so F scales as L^3.

Wait, but I'm getting more confused. Let's perhaps try to look for the correct answer in the options. The period part seems to point to 2 seconds, which is option A or G. For the force, if the period is 2 seconds, the force calculation must align.

In the options, option A has 2 sec and 7500 lb/ft. Option G has 2 sec and 9000 lb/ft.

Earlier, when I considered the force scaling as Fp= Fm *625, which came from the mass * acceleration approach, giving 7500 lb/ft, which matches option A. But when I considered Froude and force scaling via Fm= Fp /15625, it gave 187500 lb/ft, which isn't an option.

So perhaps the correct approach is the mass times acceleration approach, giving Fp=12 *625=7500 lb/ft.

So the
