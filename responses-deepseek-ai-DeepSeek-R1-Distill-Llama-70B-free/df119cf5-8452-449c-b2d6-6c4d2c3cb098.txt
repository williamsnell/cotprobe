Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see what it's asking. The question is about the positive square roots of two numbers, 200 and 121, and determining what percent larger the square root of 200 is compared to that of 121. Then I have to choose the correct option from A to J.

Hmm, right. So first, I think I need to find the square roots of both numbers. Let's start with 121 because that's a perfect square. The square root of 121 is 11 because 11 times 11 is 121. That's easy.

Now, the square root of 200. Well, 200 isn't a perfect square, so I'll have to approximate it. I remember that 14 squared is 196 and 15 squared is 225. So the square root of 200 must be between 14 and 15. Let me think more accurately. 14 squared is 196, so 200 is 4 more than that. So maybe 14 and a bit more. Let's calculate 14.1 squared: 14.1 * 14.1. 14 times 14 is 196, 14 times 0.1 is 1.4, and 0.1 times 14 is another 1.4, and 0.1 times 0.1 is 0.01. So adding those up: 196 + 1.4 +1.4 + 0.01 = 198.81. Hmm, that's still less than 200. Next, try 14.2 squared. 14.2 * 14.2. 14 times 14 is 196, 14 times 0.2 is 2.8, 0.2 times 14 is another 2.8, and 0.2 squared is 0.04. So 196 + 2.8 +2.8 +0.04 = 201.64. Oh, that's over 200. So the square root of 200 is between 14.1 and 14.2.

Wait, but maybe I can find a better approximation. Let's see, since 14.1 squared is 198.81 and 14.2 squared is 201.64. The difference between 200 and 198.81 is 1.19, and the range between 14.1 and 14.2 is 0.1 in x, which leads to an increase of 2.83 in x squared (because 201.64 -198.81 is 2.83). So 1.19 / 2.83 is approximately 0.4206. So I can estimate the square root as 14.1 + 0.4206*(0.1) = approximately 14.142. So about 14.142.

Alternatively, maybe I can just take the exact value for the square root of 200. Wait, 200 is 100 * 2, so sqrt(200) is sqrt(100*2) = 10*sqrt(2). Oh right, because sqrt(ab) = sqrt(a)*sqrt(b). And sqrt(2) is approximately 1.4142. So 10 * 1.4142 is 14.142. Oh, that's a much better way. So sqrt(200) is about 14.142.

So now, the two square roots are 11 and approximately 14.142.

The question is asking what percent larger 14.142 is compared to 11. So I think the formula for percentage increase is ((new value - original value)/original value) * 100%.

So the original value is 11, and the new value is 14.142. So the difference is 14.142 -11 = 3.142. Then, divide that by the original value, 11, so 3.142 / 11. Let me calculate that.

3.142 divided by 11. Let me see, 11 goes into 3.142 how many times. 11*0.284 is about 3.124, because 0.28 *11 is 3.08, and 0.004*11 is 0.044, so 3.08 +0.044=3.124. So 0.284 gives about 3.124, which is close to 3.142. The difference is 3.142 -3.124 = 0.018. So 0.018 /11 is approximately 0.001636. So adding that to 0.284 gives 0.2856. So approximately 28.56%.

Wait, but wait, let me check that calculation again because I might have made a mistake. Let me compute 3.142 divided by 11.

Alternatively, I can write it as 314.2 divided by 110, which is the same. 110 goes into 314 two times (220), subtract 220 from 314 gives 94. Bring down the next 0, making it 940. 110 goes into 940 eight times (880), subtract, get 60. Bring down a zero, making 600. 110 goes into 600 five times (550), subtract, get 50. Bring down another zero, making 500. 110 goes into 500 four times (440), subtract, get 60 again. So this is starting to repeat, as 600 again. So the quotient is 2.854..., so 28.54... percent.

Wait, that's about 28.54%. So to the nearest whole number, it would be 29%, right? Because 0.54 is more than 0.5, so it rounds up.

But wait, looking at the options, option I is 29. So that would be the answer. But wait, let me double-check because sometimes I might have made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, using a calculator approach, since 3.142 is approximately pi, but maybe it's easier to compute 3.142 /11. Let's do 3.142 ÷ 11.

11 × 0.28 = 3.08. 3.142 -3.08 = 0.062. 0.062 ÷ 11 = 0.00563. So total is 0.28 +0.00563 = 0.28563, so 28.563%. Rounded to the nearest whole number is 29%.

Wait, but the options are given as A:11, B:18, C:32, D:27, E:25, F:20, G:15, H:14, I:29, J:22.

So I is 29%, which would be the correct answer. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, another way to think about it: What's the percentage increase from 11 to 14.142?

The formula is ((14.142 -11)/11)*100% = (3.142/11)*100% ≈ 28.54%, which rounds to 29%.

So the correct answer should be I:29.

But wait, let me check if I did the square roots correctly. sqrt(121) is definitely 11. sqrt(200) is 14.142 as we calculated. So the difference is correct.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option D is 27, and option I is 29. So the correct answer should be 29%, which is option I.

To determine how much larger the positive square root of 200 is compared to the positive square root of 121, we first calculate the square roots:

- The square root of 121 is exactly **11** because \( 11^2 = 121 \).
- The square root of 200 is approximately **14.142**. This is derived from the fact that \( \sqrt{200} = \sqrt{100 \cdot 2} = 10 \cdot \sqrt{2} \), and \( \sqrt{2} \approx 1.4142 \). Thus, \( 10 \cdot 1.4142 = 14.142 \).

Next, we calculate the percentage increase from 11 to 14.142 using the formula for percentage increase:

\[
\text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New Value} - \text{Original Value}}{\text{Original Value}} \right) \cdot 100\%
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{14.142 - 11}{11} \right) \cdot 100\% = \left( \frac{3.142}{11} \right) \cdot 100\%
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\frac{3.142}{11} \approx 0.2856
\]

Multiplying by 100% gives:

\[
0.2856 \cdot 100\% \approx 28.56\%
\]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the percentage increase is approximately **29%**.

From the given options:

- **A: 11**
- **B: 18**
- **C: 32**
- **D: 27**
- **E: 25**
- **F: 20**
- **G: 15**
- **H: 14**
- **I: 29**
- **J: 22**

The correct answer is **I: 29**.
