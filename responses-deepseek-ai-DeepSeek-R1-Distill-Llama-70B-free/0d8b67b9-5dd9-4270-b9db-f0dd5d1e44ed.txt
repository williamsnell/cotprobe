Okay, I need to figure out the answer to this chemistry question. So the question is about identifying a liquid element that's dark-colored and nonconducting at room temperature. The options are from A to J, each being a different element.

Hmm, let's break this down. I remember that most elements are solid at room temperature, but a few are liquid. Mercury is the main one I can think of. But wait, the question says it's nonconducting. Mercury is a metal, right? Metals are usually good conductors of electricity. So if mercury conducts electricity, it doesn't fit the nonconducting part. So maybe it's not mercury, which is option H.

Wait, but the question says the element is a liquid. So I need to list elements that are liquid at room temp. Let me think: room temperature is about 20-25°C. So besides mercury, are there any others? I think gallium and cesium might have low melting points. Gallium melts at around 30°C, so at room temp, it's solid. Cesium has a melting point of about 28°C, so depending on the room temp, it might be liquid. But wait, if the room is 25°C, cesium would be liquid? Or maybe it's solid. I'm a bit confused there.

Wait, the question says it's a liquid at room temp. So I need elements that are liquid around 20-25°C. Mercury's melting point is -39°C, so it's definitely liquid. Francium is a metal too, but I'm not sure about its state at room temp. Probably solid, since it's heavier than mercury. Rubidium's melting point is around 39°C, so above room temp, so it's solid. So the only liquid element at room temp is mercury. But mercury is a metal, so it conducts electricity. But the question says nonconducting. That's confusing.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Oh! There's another element that's liquid at room temp, right? Bromine! Wait, no, bromine is a diatomic liquid, but it's an element. Wait, no—bromine is a liquid, yes. Wait, is bromine a metal? No, bromine is a nonmetal. So it doesn't conduct electricity. So bromine is a liquid element that's dark-colored and nonconducting.

Let me think about the options. Option C is bromine. So that fits. Because mercury is a metal, so it conducts, but the question is about a nonconducting substance, which would be a nonmetal. So bromine is a nonmetal, liquid at room temp, and dark-colored.

So the correct answer should be C: bromine.

The question asks for a liquid element that is dark-colored and nonconducting at room temperature. Most elements are solid at room temperature, but a few are liquid. Mercury (option H) is a liquid element, but it is a metal and conducts electricity, so it doesn't fit the nonconducting criterion. 

Bromine (option C) is a liquid element at room temperature, is dark-colored, and is a nonmetal, meaning it does not conduct electricity. This makes bromine the correct answer.

Answer: C
