Which of the following treatments did he undergo?

Options:

A: psychoanalysis

C: cognitive therapy
D: humanistic therapy

Okay, so I have this question here about Justin overcoming his fear of flying with the help of a therapist. The question asks which treatment he underwent. The options are from A to J, including various therapeutic approaches. I need to figure this out step by step.

Let me start by reading the scenario carefully. Justin was afraid of flying, so his therapist taught him relaxation exercises. Then he practiced these exercises in a gradual manner: first looking at pictures of airplanes, then watching them take off, then going into an empty plane that wouldn't fly, and finally taking a short flight. 

Hmm, this sounds like a method where the person is exposed to the feared object or situation in a controlled and gradual way. I remember that exposure therapy is a common technique used for phobias. Exposure therapy often involves creating a hierarchy of situations that trigger fear, starting from the least anxiety-provoking to the most. The person then works through these steps, using techniques like relaxation to manage their anxiety.

Now, looking at the answer options. Option B is behavior therapy. I think behavior therapy focuses on changing maladaptive behaviors through techniques like conditioning. There are different types under behavior therapy, and one of them is systematic desensitization. That rings a bell. Systematic desensitization is a technique where the person is exposed to the feared stimulus in a gradual way, and it's often paired with relaxation exercises to reduce anxiety.

So putting it together: Justin is exposed to airplanes in increasing intensity, paired with relaxation. That fits systematic desensitization, which is a form of behavior therapy. So the correct answer should be B: behavior therapy.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not confusing it with other options. Cognitive therapy (option C) focuses more on changing thought patterns. Justin isn't mentioned as working on his thoughts but rather using relaxation in exposure. So it's more about behavior than cognition. Similarly, options like psychoanalysis (A) involve exploring unconscious thoughts and past experiences, which doesn't fit here. Humanistic (D) or existential (E) therapies focus on personal growth and meaning, not behavioral techniques. Rational emotive (F) is a type of cognitive therapy. Mindfulness-based (G) might use relaxation but combined with cognitive approaches. Group therapy (H) involves groups, which isn't indicated here. Gestalt (I) and reality therapy (J) are other approaches that don't seem to fit the scenario.

Therefore, the treatment Justin underwent is behavior therapy, specifically systematic desensitization. So the correct answer is B.

The scenario describes Justin overcoming his fear of flying through gradual exposure to the feared stimulus, paired with relaxation exercises. This method aligns with systematic desensitization, a technique under behavior therapy that focuses on reducing anxiety by exposing the individual to a hierarchy of fear-inducing situations. 

Analyzing the options:
- **A (psychoanalysis):** Focuses on unconscious thoughts and past experiences, not applicable here.
- **B (behavior therapy):** Includes systematic desensitization, which matches the described approach.
- **C (cognitive therapy):** Focuses on changing thought patterns, not emphasized in the scenario.
- **D (humanistic therapy):** Centers on personal growth, not relevant.
- **E (existential therapy):** Explores meaning and existence, unrelated.
- **F (rational emotive behavior therapy):** A form of cognitive therapy, not a fit.
- **G (mindfulness-based cognitive therapy):** Combines mindfulness with cognitive techniques, not the focus here.
- **H (group therapy):** Involves group settings, not indicated.
- **I (gestalt therapy):** Focuses on present experiences and feelings, not applicable.
- **J (reality therapy):** Emphasizes personal responsibility, not relevant.

Thus, the correct answer is **B: behavior therapy**.

Answer: B
