Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this psychology ethics question. The question is about a psychologist seeing a 10-year-old child in a school setting. The main issue is about informed consent and assent. I remember that with minors, the rules are a bit different than with adults.

So, the options are from A to J. Let me think through each one. 

First, I recall that in many places, minors can't give legal consent because they're not yet considered capable of making such decisions. Instead, parents or guardians provide consent on their behalf. However, it's also important to get the child's assent, meaning the child agrees to participate, even if they can't legally consent.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Parent provides written consent, child assents non-verbally. Non-verbal assent might be possible, but I'm not sure if that's the best practice. Usually, they want some form of verbal or at least clear non-verbal agreement, but I'm not certain.

Option B: Both parent and child provide written consent. Wait, no, children can't give consent legally, only assent. So this might not be correct because the child's consent isn't valid in the same way.

Option C: Child provides written and verbal consent. That can't be right because the child can't legally consent. So this is probably wrong.

Option D: Parent provides written consent, child assents verbally. This sounds familiar. Parents give consent in writing, and the child agrees verbally. That fits what I remember about informed consent for minors.

Option E: Psychologist gets written consent from school and parents. School administration might not have the authority to consent for the child's therapy. It's usually the parents unless the school has some legal guardianship, which I don't think is the case here.

Option F: School provides consent and child assents. Again, school doesn't have the authority to consent for the child. Parents are the ones who should consent.

Option G: Parents give written and verbal consent. Well, written is usually sufficient, but it's possible. But the child's role isn't addressed here. The question is about the psychologist's responsibility, which includes getting the child's assent.

Option H: Parents verbal consent, child written. No, because the parent's consent should be written, not verbal, as it's more formal. And the child can't give written consent, only assent.

Option I: Child gives verbal assent. But what about the parents' consent? This can't be right because the parents must consent, the child can only assent.

Option J: Psychologist gets verbal consent from school. No, school isn't the one to consent; it's the parents.

So the correct answer is D. The parents provide written consent, and the child gives their assent verbally. That covers both the legal requirement (parent's consent) and the ethical practice of involving the child (assent).

The correct answer is D. The psychologist must obtain written consent from the parent(s) and verbal assent from the child, as minors cannot legally provide consent but should still agree to participate.

Answer: D
