Okay, so I've got this problem about an induction motor and plugging. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

Alright, the motor is a 3-phase, star-connected, 6-pole induction motor. The voltage is 420 V, 50 Hz. Stator and rotor leakage impedances are both (1.0 + j2.0) ohms per phase. It's driving a pure-inertia load, which means I don't have to worry about any load torque except inertia. The total inertia is J = 3.0 kg·m². The motor is running at 960 rpm, and we need to find the time to bring it to a standstill by plugging.

Wait, plugging... what's that again? Oh right, plugging means reversing the phase sequence of the power supply. This causes the motor to develop a torque in the opposite direction, which helps in braking. So the motor acts like a generator when plugged, right?

First, I think I need to find the initial speed. Oh wait, it's given: 960 rpm. But I might need it in rad/s or something. Wait, but for inertia and torque, angular acceleration is involved. Maybe I should convert it to radians per second, but I'm not sure yet.

The motor is 6-pole. So the synchronous speed can be calculated. The synchronous speed n_s for a 6-pole motor at 50 Hz is n_s = (120 * f) / p. So that's (120 * 50)/6 = 1000 rpm. Oh, so the motor is running at 960 rpm, which is just below the synchronous speed. So the slip s is (n_s - n)/n_s. Let's compute that: (1000-960)/1000 = 0.04 or 4%. So s=0.04.

But wait, during plugging, what's the slip? When you plug, the motor's phase sequence is reversed, so the slip becomes s' = 2 - s. Because when you reverse the direction, the relative speed is effectively 2 - s. So s' would be 2 - 0.04 = 1.96? Or wait, maybe it's s'=2 - s? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The initial slip is s = (n_s - n)/n_s = 0.04. After plugging, the motor's speed is in the opposite direction relative to the stator field. So the new slip would be s' = (n_s + n')/n_s, but n' is negative. Wait, perhaps s' = 2 - s. Yeah, I think that's the formula I've heard before. So s' would be 2 - 0.04 = 1.96. So s' =1.96.

Now, the torque developed during plugging. The torque of an induction motor is given by T = (3 * (V^2) * R2/(s)) ) / (ω_s * (R1^2 + (s * X1)^2) )? Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, the electromagnetic torque can be calculated using the formula T = ( (3 V_t^2 ) / (ω_s) ) * ( (R2/s) ) / ( (R1 + R2/s)^2 + (X1 + X2)^2 ) ). Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the exact formula. Alternatively, the torque can be approximated when considering that during plugging, the slip is high, so the rotor resistance dominates. But perhaps the exact calculation is needed.

Alternatively, the torque when plugging can be found using the same equivalent circuit as in normal operation but with s' = 2 - s. So the torque is proportional to (s')/(something). Wait, the torque equation for an induction motor is T = (3 V^2 R2 ) / (s ω_s (R1^2 + X1^2 + R2^2/s^2 + X2^2 )) )? Hmm, not sure. Maybe a better approach is to compute the torque using the rotor current.

Wait, another approach: the electromagnetic torque of an induction motor is given by T = (3/ω_s) * ( (V_t)^2 * (R2/s) ) / ( (R1 + R2/s)^2 + (X1 + X2)^2 ) ). So I think that's correct.

Wait, but in the case of plugging, the slip s is 1.96, which is quite high, so the torque would be lower. Hmm, but let me try to compute it step by step.

First, let's compute the stator phase voltage. Since it's a star-connected motor, the phase voltage V_p is 420 / sqrt(3) ≈ 242.5 V.

Wait, but in the formula, V_t is the line voltage, or the phase voltage? Oh, wait, no. The standard torque formula usually uses the stator phase voltage. Since it's star-connected, each phase has V_ph = V_line / sqrt(3) = 420 / 1.732 ≈ 242.5 V.

Then, R1 and R2 are the stator and rotor resistances. Wait, the problem states that both stator and referred rotor leakage impedances are (1.0 + j2.0) ohms per phase. So R1 = 1 ohm, X1 = 2 ohm. Similarly, R2' =1 ohm, X2=2 ohm (since referred to stator). Wait, but R2 is the rotor resistance referred to the stator side, right? So yes, R2' =1 ohm and X2=2 ohm.

So the torque formula would be T = (3 * (V_ph)^2 * (R2'/s) ) / ( ω_s * [ (R1 + R2'/s)^2 + (X1 + X2)^2 ] ) )

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the formula can be written as T = ( (3 V_ph^2) / (ω_s) ) * ( (R2/s) ) / ( (R1 + R2/s)^2 + (X1 + X2)^2 ) )

Wait, let me double-check. The standard torque equation is T = (3/ω_s) * [ (V_ph)^2 * (R2/s) ) / ( (R1 + R2/s)^2 + (X1 + X2)^2 ) ) ]

Yes, that seems right. So let's compute that with s'=1.96.

So V_ph is 242.5 V.

Let me compute numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator_part = (V_ph)^2 * (R2/s) = (242.5)^2 * (1 / 1.96 )

Denominator_part = (R1 + R2/s)^2 + (X1 + X2)^2 )

R1 is 1, R2/s is 1/1.96 ≈ 0.5102. So R1 + R2/s ≈ 1 + 0.5102 = 1.5102.

X1 + X2 = 2 + 2 =4.

So denominator_part = (1.5102)^2 + (4)^2 ≈ 2.2807 + 16 = 18.2807.

So numerator_part = (242.5)^2 * (1/1.96) ≈ (58906.25) * (0.5102) ≈ 30086.08.

Then, the torque T would be (3 / ω_s) * (30086.08) / 18.2807.

Wait, but what is ω_s? The synchronous speed in radians per second. Synchronous speed n_s is 1000 rpm. Converting to rad/s: ω_s = (2π * n_s) / 60 = (2 * π * 1000) /60 ≈ 104.7198 rad/s.

So T = (3 / 104.7198) * (30086.08 / 18.2807 )

Let me compute 30086.08 / 18.2807 ≈ 30086 /18.28 ≈ 1645.5.

Then, 3/104.7198 ≈ 0.02864.

So T ≈ 0.02864 * 1645.5 ≈ 47.12 N·m. Wait, that seems a bit high, but let's proceed.

Wait, but during plugging, the torque is negative, opposing the motion. So the motor will develop a braking torque.

Now, the total inertia is J =3 kg·m².

The angular acceleration α is given by α = T_net / J. Since friction and other torques are neglected, T_net is just the electromagnetic torque, which is negative (braking).

So α = -47.12 / 3 ≈ -15.71 rad/s².

Wait, but the initial angular velocity is ω_initial = 960 rpm. Let's convert that to rad/s: 960 * 2π /60 ≈ 31.831 rad/s.

Wait, but since the motor is being braked, the angular velocity will decrease over time. The time to come to standstill can be found by using the kinematic equation:

Δω = α * t.

Since final ω is 0, initial ω is 31.831 rad/s, and α is negative (deceleration), so:

0 = ω_initial + α * t => t = -ω_initial / α.

But α is negative, so t = (31.831) / 15.71 ≈ 2.026 seconds. Hmm, that's about 2 seconds. But wait, looking at the options, E is 2.0s. But that seems a bit low, perhaps I made a mistake in the torque calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the calculations step by step.

Wait, perhaps I got the slip wrong. So during plugging, the slip s' is 2 - s. But s = 0.04, so s' = 1.96.

But wait, in the torque formula, s is the slip. So when s is greater than 1, does that affect the formula?

Alternatively, perhaps there's a simpler approach. Because plugging causes the motor to develop maximum braking torque, but wait, maximum torque in braking is achieved when s' is such that the power factor is unity. Hmm, but maybe that's more complicated.

Wait, another approach: The maximum torque for an induction motor occurs when R2/s = sqrt(R1^2 + (X1 + X2)^2 ). But maybe that's for normal operation, not sure how it applies during plugging.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the braking torque is proportional to the square of the voltage and inversely proportional to the slip. But I'm not sure.

Wait, going back to the torque equation. Let me recompute the torque more carefully.

V_ph = 420 / sqrt(3) ≈ 242.5 V.

R1 = 1, X1 = 2.

R2' =1, X2=2.

s' =1.96.

So, the denominator terms:

R1 + R2/s' = 1 + (1/1.96) ≈ 1 + 0.5102 = 1.5102 ohms.

X1 + X2 = 2 + 2 =4 ohms.

So the denominator is sqrt( (1.5102)^2 + 4^2 ) ≈ sqrt(2.2807 + 16) = sqrt(18.2807) ≈ 4.277 ohms.

The numerator is V_ph^2 * (R2/s') = (242.5)^2 * (1/1.96) ≈ 58906.25 * 0.5102 ≈ 30086 ohm².

Wait, but in the torque formula, I think the denominator is (R1 + R2/s')² + (X1 + X2)², which we have as 18.2807.

So the torque T = (3 * 30086 ) / ( ω_s * 18.2807 )

Wait, no, wait. The formula is T = (3 V_ph^2 R2/s') / (ω_s [ (R1 + R2/s')^2 + (X1 + X2)^2 ] )

So V_ph^2 is (242.5)^2 ≈ 58906.25.

So numerator: 3 * 58906.25 * (1/1.96) ≈ 3 * 58906.25 * 0.5102 ≈ 3 * 30086 ≈ 90258.

Denominator: ω_s * 18.2807 ≈ 104.7198 * 18.2807 ≈ 1914.8.

So T ≈ 90258 / 1914.8 ≈ 47.1 N·m.

So that's the torque. So the angular acceleration α is T/J: 47.1 /3 ≈ 15.7 rad/s², but in the opposite direction, so α is -15.7 rad/s².

Initial angular speed ω0 is 960 rpm = 960*(2π/60) = 32π ≈31.83 rad/s.

Time to stop is when ω=0, so t = (0 - ω0)/α = (-31.83)/(-15.7) ≈ 2.027 seconds.

Wait, but that's about 2 seconds, which is option E.

But wait, that seems really fast. Plugging is supposed to be a quick stop, but 2 seconds for a motor seems quick, but perhaps it's possible. However, looking at the options, option E is 2.0s. So that would be the answer.

But wait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation. Let me check the torque again.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum torque during braking is when the slip is such that the torque is maximum, but I'm not considering that here.

Wait, another approach: during plugging, the torque can be approximated as T_b = (4 * T_max) / s, but I'm not sure about that. Alternatively, another formula: When plugging, the torque developed is -k * s, where k is some constant, but I think I'm confusing it with something else.

Wait, another way to think about it: The initial kinetic energy is (1/2) J ω². The power dissipated is torque times angular velocity. Integration over time would give the energy, but perhaps that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the average torque during braking. Hmm, but in the case of plugging, the torque is constant because the slip is approximately constant? Wait, no, as the speed changes, the slip s' = (n_s + n) / n_s. So as the speed decreases, s' decreases, so the torque changes over time. Therefore, my initial assumption that torque is constant may not be valid. Therefore, the calculation I did earlier that assumes constant torque may not be accurate. So perhaps the time is longer than 2 seconds.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says to neglect transient switching torques and other torques except inertial. So maybe it's acceptable to use the average torque or approximate it as constant.

Alternatively, perhaps the deceleration is not constant, so the initial calculation of t ≈2s is an underestimate. So perhaps the time is longer.

Wait, maybe I should compute it using energy methods. The kinetic energy is (1/2) J ω². The work done by the torque is integral of T(t) * ω(t) dt from 0 to t. But since T is a function of slip, which depends on ω, this becomes complex.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that when plugging, the torque is given by T = k * s, where k is a constant that depends on the motor parameters. Then, since T = J * dω/dt, and ω = ω0 - (T/J) t, but T depends on s, which is function of ω. So it's a differential equation.

Wait, let me try that approach. Let s' = (n_s + n(t)) / n_s = 1 + (n(t)/n_s). Since n(t) is the speed at time t, which is going from 960 rpm to 0. So s' = 1 + (n(t)/1000). So, s' = 1 + (ω(t) *60/(2π) ) / 1000 ). Wait, maybe it's easier to express s' in terms of ω(t).

Wait, n_s is 1000 rpm, ω_s is 104.7198 rad/s. The slip during plugging is s' = (ω_s + ω_m) / ω_s, where ω_m is the motor's angular speed. Wait, no, more accurately, s' = (ω_s - (-ω_m)) / ω_s = (ω_s + ω_m)/ω_s. But that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to model this as a differential equation. Let me set up the equation.

The torque is T = (3 V_ph^2 R2 s') / (ω_s [ (R1 + R2 s')^2 + (X1 + X2)^2 ] ), but that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using the steady-state torque equation, but as s' varies with time, it's not straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps the torque can be considered inversely proportional to s'. So T ≈ k / s', where k is some constant.

Wait, another approach: Find the initial torque and the final torque, and find an average. But I'm not sure if that's accurate.

Wait, let's think again about the initial torque. I calculated about 47 N·m, leading to a deceleration of about 15.7 rad/s² and a stopping time of ~2s. But perhaps this is an overestimation because as the speed decreases, the slip s' decreases, which might cause the torque to increase or decrease.

Wait, when the motor slows down, the slip s' decreases because s' = (n_s + n(t)) /n_s. So as n(t) decreases, s' approaches 1. So, as the speed decreases, s' decreases from 1.96 to 1.0.

Looking at the torque equation, T is proportional to (R2/s') divided by [ (R1 + R2/s')² + (X1 + X2)² ].

So as s' decreases, R2/s' increases. Let's see:

At s'=1.96, R2/s' = 0.5102.

At s'=1.0, R2/s' =1.0.

So the torque would change as s' changes.

Let me compute the torque at s'=1.96 and at s'=1.0.

At s'=1.96:

Denominator terms: R1 + R2/s' =1 + 0.5102=1.5102, X terms=4. So denominator is sqrt( (1.5102)^2
