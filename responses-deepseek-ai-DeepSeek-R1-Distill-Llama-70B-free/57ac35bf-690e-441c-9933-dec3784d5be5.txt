Okay, so I've got this problem here about heat flow across a cylindrical surface. Hmm, I remember that heat flow is related to the concept of heat flux, which involves the temperature gradient. Let me think about what I learned in class.

The problem gives me the temperature function u(x,y,z) = 2y² + 2z². The substance has a conductivity K of 6.5. I need to find the rate of heat flow inward across the cylindrical surface defined by y² + z² =6, and x ranges from 0 to 4. The options are given as A to J, all multiples of pi, so the final answer should be something times pi.

Wait, I think the formula for heat flow involves integrating the dot product of the heat flux vector and the normal vector over the surface. Oh right, the heat flux is given by q = -K * gradient(u). So the heat flux vector is negative K times the gradient of u. Since K is positive, the heat flows from higher to lower temperatures.

So the heat flow inward across the surface is the surface integral of q · n dS, where n is the unit normal vector pointing inward.

But wait, I need to be careful with the direction. The problem asks for inward flow, so the normal vector should point inward. For a cylinder like y² + z² =6, the outward normal would typically be in the radial direction, so inward would be the opposite direction.

Alternatively, perhaps using the divergence theorem might be easier, but wait, the divergence theorem applies to closed surfaces. The cylinder here is open along x=0 and x=4, so it's not closed. So maybe I can't directly use that. Hmm.

Wait, the cylinder is a closed surface in the y and z directions but open in x. So perhaps I can set up the surface integral over the curved part of the cylinder.

Let me think. The surface is y² + z² =6. So parametrizing it, I can use cylindrical coordinates. Let’s say y = sqrt(6) cos(theta), z = sqrt(6) cos(theta), wait no, wait y² + z² =6, so in cylindrical coordinates, that would be r= sqrt(6), but wait in standard y and z, so maybe using y and z as the axes for the cylinder.

Wait, perhaps it's better to parametrize the cylinder. Let me think: the cylinder's equation is y² + z² =6. So for each point on the cylinder, the position vector can be written as (x, y, z) where y = sqrt(6) cos(theta), z = sqrt(6) sin(theta), and x varies from 0 to 4. Theta would go from 0 to 2pi.

So the parametrization is r(x, theta) = (x, sqrt(6) cos(theta), sqrt(6) sin(theta)).

Now, to find the surface integral, I need to compute the flux of the heat flux vector through this surface.

The heat flux vector q is -K grad u.

Let me compute the gradient of u first. u = 2y² + 2z².

So the gradient of u is (du/dx, du/dy, du/dz) = (0, 4y, 4z). Because derivative of 2y² is 4y? Wait no, wait 2y² derivative is 4y? Wait no, wait 2y² derivative with respect to y is 4y? Wait, no, 2y² differentiates to 4y? Wait, no, wait that's incorrect. 2y² differentiates with respect to y as 4y? Wait no, 2y² is (d/dy) 2y² = 4y? No, wait no, wait 2y² derivative is 4y? Wait, no, wait no! No, wait, the derivative of 2y² with respect to y is 4y, but wait no, wait 2y² derivative is 4y? Wait, wait, no. Wait 2y² is 2*(y squared), so derivative with respect to y is 2*(2y) =4y? Wait no, wait 2y² derivative is 4y? Wait no, that's not right. I think I made a mistake here.

Wait, no, wait. Let me compute it correctly. The function u(x,y,z) = 2y² + 2z². So the partial derivative with respect to y is d/dy (2y²) = 4y. Wait, no! Wait, no, wait, no, wait 2y²'s derivative is 4y? No, no, wait 2y² is 2*(y squared), so derivative is 2*2y =4y. Oh wait, that's correct. So du/dy =4y, du/dz=4z, and du/dx=0. So the gradient is (0,4y,4z).

So the heat flux vector q is -K times gradient u, so K is 6.5, so q = -6.5*(0,4y,4z) = (0, -26y, -26z).

Wait, but wait, actually, the heat flux is q = -K * grad u. So yes, each component is multiplied by -6.5.

So q = (-6.5 * 0, -6.5 *4y, -6.5 *4z) = (0, -26y, -26z).

Now, the heat flow inward is the flux of q through the surface S, which is the cylinder. So the flux is the integral over S of q · n dS, where n is the unit normal vector pointing inward.

Wait, but wait, for a cylinder y² + z² =6, the normal vector pointing outward would be in the direction of (0, y, z) because for a cylinder around the x-axis, the outward normal is radial in y and z. So if the cylinder is y² + z²=6, then the outward normal vector at each point is (0, y, z) divided by the radius, which is sqrt(y² + z²) = sqrt(6). So the outward normal is (0, y/sqrt(6), z/sqrt(6)).

But since we want the inward normal, it's the negative of that: (0, -y/sqrt(6), -z/sqrt(6)).

Wait, but let me think again. The gradient of the function y² + z² is (0, 2y, 2z), which points in the outward direction. So the outward normal vector would be (0, y, z) normalized. So to get the inward normal, it's (0, -y, -z) normalized.

So n = (0, -y, -z)/sqrt(y² + z²). But since y² + z²=6, it's (0, -y, -z)/sqrt(6).

So n = (0, -y, -z)/sqrt(6).

Now, we need to take the dot product of q and n.

q is (0, -26y, -26z).

n is (0, -y/sqrt(6), -z/sqrt(6)).

So the dot product is 0*0 + (-26y)*(-y/sqrt(6)) + (-26z)*(-z/sqrt(6)).

That is (26 y² + 26 z²)/sqrt(6).

Wait, let me compute that step by step.

q · n = [0 * 0] + [(-26y) * (-y/sqrt(6))] + [(-26z) * (-z/sqrt(6))]

So that's 0 + (26 y^2)/sqrt(6) + (26 z^2)/sqrt(6) = 26(y² + z²)/sqrt(6).

But wait, on the cylinder, y² + z² =6, so this becomes 26 *6 / sqrt(6) = (156)/sqrt(6).

Simplify that: 156/sqrt(6) can be rationalized as (156 sqrt(6))/6 = 26 sqrt(6).

Wait, wait, let me compute it correctly.

Wait, 156 divided by sqrt(6) is 156 * sqrt(6)/6, because multiply numerator and denominator by sqrt(6): 156/sqrt(6) = (156 sqrt(6))/6 = (156/6) sqrt(6) = 26 sqrt(6).

So q · n =26 sqrt(6).

Wait, that's a constant value, right? Because y² + z² is always 6 on the cylinder. So this term is the same everywhere on the surface. That's going to make the integral easier.

So the flux integral is the integral over the surface S of q · n dS. Since q · n is 26 sqrt(6), and the surface is the cylinder with x from 0 to4, the integral becomes 26 sqrt(6) multiplied by the surface area of the cylinder.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the surface S is the lateral (curved) surface of the cylinder, right? So the area element dS for a cylinder of radius r and height h is 2 pi r h.

In this case, the radius r is sqrt(6) because y² + z²=6. The height is 4 (from x=0 to x=4).

So the surface area is 2 pi * sqrt(6) *4 = 8 pi sqrt(6).

But wait, let me make sure. The formula for the lateral surface area of a cylinder is 2 pi r h, where r is the radius and h is the height. So with r = sqrt(6), h=4, yes, it's 2 pi * sqrt(6) *4 =8 pi sqrt(6).

So the integral would be q · n * dS, but since q · n is constant, the integral is 26 sqrt(6) * 8 pi sqrt(6).

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, actually, wait.

Wait, the flux integral is ∫∫ (q · n) dS. Since q · n is 26 sqrt(6), which is a constant, the integral is (26 sqrt(6)) * (surface area of S).

But surface area of S is the lateral area, which is 2 pi r h = 2 pi * sqrt(6) *4 =8 pi sqrt(6).

So the integral is 26 sqrt(6) * 8 pi sqrt(6) = 26 *8 * (sqrt(6)*sqrt(6)) *pi.

sqrt(6)*sqrt(6) is 6, so that becomes 26 *8 *6 *pi.

Compute that: 26*8=208, 208*6=1248.

So the integral is 1248 pi.

Looking at the options, option C is 1248 pi.

Wait, that makes sense. Let me recap the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Compute the gradient of u: (0,4y,4z).

2. Multiply by -K to get q: (0, -26 y, -26 z).

3. Determine the inward normal vector on the cylinder: (0, -y, -z)/sqrt(6).

4. Compute the dot product: q · n = (26 y² +26 z^2)/sqrt(6) = 26*(6)/sqrt(6) = 156/sqrt(6) =26 sqrt(6).

5. Compute the surface area of the cylinder: 2 pi r h =2 pi sqrt(6)*4=8 pi sqrt(6).

6. Multiply the constant q·n by the surface area: 26 sqrt(6) * 8 pi sqrt(6) =26*8*6 pi=1248 pi.

Yes, that seems correct.

So the answer should be option C: 1248 pi.

To find the rate of heat flow inward across the cylindrical surface \( y^2 + z^2 = 6 \), \( 0 \leq x \leq 4 \), we start by noting the temperature function \( u(x, y, z) = 2y^2 + 2z^2 \) and the thermal conductivity \( K = 6.5 \). The heat flux vector is given by \( \mathbf{q} = -K \nabla u \), where \( \nabla u \) is the gradient of \( u \).

### Step 1: Compute the gradient of \( u \)
The gradient of \( u \) is:
\[
\nabla u = \left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial u}{\partial z} \right) = (0, 4y, 4z).
\]

### Step 2: Compute the heat flux vector \( \mathbf{q} \)
The heat flux vector is:
\[
\mathbf{q} = -K \nabla u = -6.5 (0, 4y, 4z) = (0, -26y, -26z).
\]

### Step 3: Determine the inward normal vector
For the cylinder \( y^2 + z^2 = 6 \), the outward normal vector is proportional to \( (0, y, z) \). Normalizing, the outward normal is:
\[
\mathbf{n}_{\text{out}} = \frac{(0, y, z)}{\sqrt{y^2 + z^2}} = \frac{(0, y, z)}{\sqrt{6}}.
\]
The inward normal vector is:
\[
\mathbf{n}_{\text{in}} = -\mathbf{n}_{\text{out}} = \frac{(0, -y, -z)}{\sqrt{6}}.
\]

### Step 4: Compute \( \mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{n}_{\text{in}} \)
The dot product is:
\[
\mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{n}_{\text{in}} = (0, -26y, -26z) \cdot \frac{(0, -y, -z)}{\sqrt{6}} = \frac{26y^2 + 26z^2}{\sqrt{6}}.
\]
On the cylinder, \( y^2 + z^2 = 6 \), so:
\[
\mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{n}_{\text{in}} = \frac{26 \cdot 6}{\sqrt{6}} = \frac{156}{\sqrt{6}} = 26\sqrt{6}.
\]

### Step 5: Compute the surface area of the cylinder
The lateral surface area of the cylinder is:
\[
A = 2\pi r h = 2\pi \sqrt{6} \cdot 4 = 8\pi\sqrt{6}.
\]

### Step 6: Compute the heat flow
The heat flow inward is:
\[
\text{Heat flow} = \int_S \mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{n}_{\text{in}} \, dS = (\mathbf{q} \cdot \mathbf{n}_{\text{in}}) \cdot A = 26\sqrt{6} \cdot 8\pi\sqrt{6}.
\]
Simplify:
\[
\text{Heat flow} = 26 \cdot 8 \cdot (\sqrt{6} \cdot \sqrt{6}) \cdot \pi = 26 \cdot 8 \cdot 6 \cdot \pi = 1248\pi.
\]

### Final Answer
The rate of heat flow inward across the cylindrical surface is \( 1248\pi \), which corresponds to option **C**.
