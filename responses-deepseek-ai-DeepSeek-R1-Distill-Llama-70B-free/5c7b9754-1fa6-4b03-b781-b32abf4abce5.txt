Question:

A surgeon operated on a patient in an operating room in the Marina General Hospital. The surgeon was assisted by an intern, who was assigned to the operation by the hospital, and a nurse, who was on the staff of the hospital. During the patient's convalescence, the patient complained of pain not explicable as an ordinary post-operative symptom. On investigation, it turned out that the intern and nurse, who had worked together in bandaging him, had done so in such a way as to constrict certain blood vessels. The faulty bandaging had caused acute pain and retarded the patient's recovery. After the patient's eventual recovery, he sued the intern, claiming $20,000 in damages. Before the case went to trial, the patient and intern agreed to a settlement in which the intern paid the patient $12,000, and the patient released the intern from all further claims for liability arising out of the incident. If the intern brings suit against the nurse for contribution, the most likely result is that the intern will

Options:

A: prevail, because the nurse's liability is established under res ipsa loquitur
B: not prevail, because the intern was the one who agreed to the settlement.
C: not prevail, because the intern's proper remedy is indemnification, not contribution.
D: not prevail, because one who settles without judgment cannot recover contribution.
E: not prevail, because the nurse was just following the intern's orders.
F: not prevail, because the intern already accepted a settlement.
G: prevail, because one who settles without judgment can recover contribution.
H: prevail, because both were equally responsible for the patient's pain.
I: prevail, because the nurse was also involved in the faulty bandaging.
J: prevail, because the nurse should have known better as a staff member of the hospital.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's break it down step by step. 

The scenario is about a surgeon, an intern, and a nurse involved in an operation. The patient ended up having extra pain because the intern and nurse bandaged him in a way that constricted blood vessels, slowing his recovery. The patient sued the intern for $20k, and they settled for $12k, with the patient releasing the intern from further claims.

Now, the question is about whether the intern can sue the nurse for contribution. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the right one.

First, I recall that when multiple parties are involved in a tort, each can be held jointly and severally liable. So, if both the intern and nurse were negligent, they might both be responsible. But here, the intern settled with the patient. 

Contribution is when one party who's paid more than their share can get others to pay their fair share. But I think there's a rule about settling without a judgment. If someone settles a claim without a court judgment determining liability, can they then seek contribution from others?

I remember something about Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act. I think that if a defendant settles without a judgment, they can still seek contribution from other tortfeasors. Wait, but some sources say that in some jurisdictions, you can't seek contribution if you settled without an adjudication of liability. Hmm. 

Looking at the options, option D says the intern can't recover because he settled without judgment. Option G says he can because he settled without judgment. So which is correct?

Wait, I think it's possible to seek contribution even after a settlement. Because the idea is that each tortfeasor should pay their share. So if the intern paid 12k, but maybe he was only 50% responsible, he could ask the nurse to pay half of that. 

But I also remember that in some cases, if you settle and release the plaintiff, you might release others as well, but that's more about releasing the other tortfeasors, not about your ability to seek contribution. 

Wait, another point: the nurse was on the hospital's staff, and the intern was assigned by the hospital. So maybe there's an employer-employee relationship. If the intern and nurse were both employees of the hospital, the hospital might be vicariously liable, but that's not directly relevant here since the intern is suing the nurse, not the hospital.

Another angle: if the intern is seeking contribution, he needs to show that the nurse was also liable. So the question is, can the intern get contribution from the nurse after settling?

I think the key issue is whether a settlement without a judgment bars the intern from seeking contribution. From what I remember, under the Uniform Act, a tortfeasor who settles is not precluded from seeking contribution. So the intern can still sue the nurse for contribution. 

Wait, but option D says the opposite. Let me think again. Some jurisdictions might require that there be a judgment against the settling party before they can seek contribution. But I think the majority rule is that you can seek contribution even after a settlement because the settlement doesn't necessarily establish liability; it's just a compromise.

So looking at the options, option G says the intern will prevail because one who settles without judgment can recover contribution. That sounds right. 

But wait, option D says they can't because they settled without judgment. I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to remember. 

I think the rule is that a settlement does not preclude a claim for contribution. So if the intern settled, he can still seek contribution from the nurse. So the correct answer would be G. 

Wait, but another point: sometimes when you settle, you release all claims against other tortfeasors. But in this case, the patient released the intern, not the other way around. So the intern is releasing the patient's claims against him, but he's still free to go after the nurse.

So putting it all together, the intern can seek contribution from the nurse because the settlement doesn't bar that. So the answer should be G. 

Looking again at the options:

Option D: Not prevail because settled without judgment. 

Option G: Prevail because settled without judgment.

I think G is correct because the Uniform Act allows it. So the intern will likely prevail.

The question revolves around whether an intern, who settled with a patient for $12,000 after a faulty bandaging incident, can seek contribution from the nurse involved in the same incident. The key issue is whether settling without a judgment bars the intern from seeking contribution. 

Under the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act, a settlement does not necessarily preclude a party from seeking contribution from other tortfeasors. The settlement is considered a compromise and does not establish liability. Therefore, the intern can still pursue contribution from the nurse, as the settlement does not bar this claim. 

Option G correctly reflects this principle, stating that the intern will prevail because one who settles without judgment can recover contribution. Other options, such as D, incorrectly suggest that a settlement without judgment precludes contribution, which is not consistent with the majority rule under the Uniform Act.

**Answer: G**
