Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric fields. Hmm, let's see... The question is asking for the intensity of the electric field 10 cm away from a negative point charge of 500 stat-coulombs in air. The options are from A to J.

Wait, I'm a bit rusty on electric field equations. I remember that the electric field E is given by Coulomb's law, right? E equals k times Q divided by r squared. Oh wait, but wait—what are the units here? Because I'm getting confused between SI units and Gaussian units. Oh right, in Gaussian (or cgs units), the formula is a bit different.

So in Gaussian units, the electric field E is equal to Q/(r²) times some constant, but I think the factor is 1 there. Or wait, no—wait, because the formula in Gaussian is E = (Q)/(r²) times the factor, but I think in Gaussian, the Coulomb's law constant is 1, so E is just Q/(r²). But wait, I might be mixing things up.

Wait, let me think again. Coulomb's law in Gaussian units is F = (Q1 Q2)/(r²), without any constant factor because the units are defined such that the constant is 1. So the electric field E is defined as F/q, so E would be Q/(r²). So E equals Q divided by r squared. Oh, but wait, the charge here is given in stat-coulombs. And the distance is in centimeters, so I need to convert that to the same unit system.

Wait, the distance is 10 cm, which is 10 centimeters. In cgs units, 1 meter is 100 cm, so 10 cm is 0.1 meters. But wait, in Gaussian units, do we use meters or centimeters as the base unit? I'm getting a bit confused. Wait, in cgs units, the base unit of length is the centimeter, so distances are in cm.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify. The Gaussian unit system uses centimeter-gram-second. So for electric field calculations, the distance r is in centimeters. So in this case, r is 10 cm. So r squared is (10 cm)^2 = 100 cm².

The charge Q is 500 stat-coulombs. So plugging into E = Q/(r²), we get E = 500 stat-coul/(100 cm²) = 5 stat-coul/cm².

Wait, but electric field is measured in dynes per stat-coulomb. Because E = F/q, and F is in dynes, q in stat-coulombs, so E is dynes/stat-coul.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the units. The electric field E in Gaussian units has units of dynes per stat-coulomb. So how does that come about?

Because F = q E, so F (force) is in dynes, q in stat-coulombs. Solving for E, E = F/q → dynes/stat-coul.

So if E is 5 stat-coul/cm², but wait, wait a minute. Wait, no—Wait, E is Q/(r²), but Q is in stat-coulombs and r is in cm. So E will have units of stat-coul/cm². But how does that relate to dynes per stat-coul?

Ah, wait a second. Because in Gaussian units, the electric field E is defined such that E = F / q, and F is in dynes, q in stat-coulombs. So E's unit is dyne/stat-coul.

But when we calculate E as Q/(r²), the units would be (stat-coul) / cm². How does that become dyne/stat-coul?

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a conversion factor here. Wait, in Gaussian units, the Coulomb force law is F = (Q1 Q2)/(r²) * (1/(4π ε₀)), but in Gaussian, 4π ε₀ is 1, so F = Q1 Q2 / r². But the units of F are dynes, and Q is in stat-coulombs, r in cm.

So what's the relation between electric field and these units? Let me think.

Electric field E is defined as F = q E. So E = F/q. F is in dynes, q in stat-coulombs, so E is in dyne/stat-coul.

So when I compute E as Q/(r²), let me check the units.

Q is in stat-coulombs, r in cm. So E has units of (stat-coul)/(cm²). So how do I convert that to (dyne/stat-coul)?

Wait, perhaps I'm missing the permittivity factor. Wait, no, because in Gaussian, 1/(4π ε₀) is 1. So the electric field E is (Q)/(r²) in units of (stat-coul)/(cm²), but how does that equate to dyne/stat-coul?

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's do the calculation step by step.

Given:

Q = 500 stat-coulombs.

r = 10 cm.

E = k * Q / r².

Wait, wait, in Gaussian units, the expression is E = (1/(4π ε₀)) * (Q/r²). But since 1/(4π ε₀) is 1 in Gaussian, the formula becomes E = Q/(r²).

Wait, but what's the unit here? Let's see.

In Gaussian units, the unit of charge is stat-coulomb (statC). The unit of E is dynes/statC because E is force per charge.

So when I compute E = Q/(r²), the unit would be (statC)/(cm²). But I want to express it in terms of dynes per statC.

So perhaps I need to include a conversion factor here. Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the unit system.

Wait, perhaps an alternative approach. The electric field in Gaussian units can be expressed as E = (Q)/(r²) * (1 cm² / (dyne·statC⁻¹)).

Wait, no, that's getting more confusing. Let me think about the unit conversion factors.

Wait, in Gaussian units, the unit of E is dynes per stat-coulomb, which is (g cm/s²) / (statC). Now, 1 dyne = 1 g·cm/s².

So E in units is (g cm/s²) / (statC).

Now, when I compute E as Q/(r²), the units are (statC) / (cm²). So how to get from (statC/cm²) to (dyne/statC)?

Ah, perhaps I need to multiply by a conversion factor. Let me think about it.

Wait, Coulomb's law in Gaussian is F = Q1 Q2 / r². The unit of F is dynes, Q is statC, r is cm.

So F has units (statC)^2 / cm². So 1 dyne = (statC)^2 / cm².

So solving for dyne, 1 dyne = (statC²)/cm².

So now, if E = F/q, then E has units (dyne)/(statC) = (statC²/cm²) / (statC) ) = (statC) / cm².

Hmm, so E's unit is (statC)/(cm²), but wait, earlier I thought E's unit is dyne/statC.

Wait, that's contradictory. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, let me try to write the unit analysis more carefully.

In Gaussian units:

F (force) has units of dynes, which is g·cm/s².

Coulomb's law: F = (Q1 Q2) / r².

So unit-wise: dyne = (statC * statC) / (cm²).

Because r is in cm. So:

dyne = (statC)^2 / cm².

So solving for (statC)^2: (statC)^2 = dyne * cm².

Taking square root: statC = sqrt( dyne * cm² ).

Hmm, but I'm not sure if that helps. Maybe it's easier to accept that E has units of dyne/statC, and the formula E = Q/(r²) must then have E in (statC/cm²), but that's not matching. So perhaps I'm missing a factor in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula in Gaussian units is E = (Q)/(r²) * (1/(1 cm²)).

Wait, perhaps I should consider the units within the formula more carefully.

Wait, let's think about the formula for E again. The formula is E = (1/(4π ε₀)) * (Q/r²). But in Gaussian units, 1/(4π ε₀) is equal to 1. So E = Q/(r²).

But what are the units of E?

In SI units, E would be volts per meter (V/m), but in Gaussian it's different.

Wait, another approach: the unit of E in Gaussian is dyne/statC.

So, E (unit): dyne/statC.

dyne is g·cm/s², so E unit is (g cm/s²) / (statC).

So, I need to express E as Q/(r²) and have the units come out to (g cm/s²)/statC.

So, E = Q/(r²) → (statC) / (cm²).

So, how to convert (statC/cm²) into (g cm/s²)/statC.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing the unit conversion factor involving the permittivity or something else. Alternatively, perhaps I should recall that 1 dyne = 1 g·cm/s².

Wait, let's write E as (Q)/(r²) → (statC)/(cm²).

We need to convert that into (g cm/s²)/(statC).

So, let's perform unit conversion:

(statC/cm²) → multiply by (g cm/s²)/(statC) ) to get (g cm/s²)/(statC).

Wait, but how?

Wait, perhaps I need to find the conversion between (statC/cm²) and (g cm/s²)/(statC).

Wait, that might be tricky. Let me think differently. Let me see what 1 (statC/cm²) equals in terms of E's unit.

1 E_unit = 1 dyne/statC = (g cm/s²)/statC.

So, if E = Q/(r²) = 500/(10)^2 = 500/100 = 5 (statC/cm²).

So E is 5 statC/cm², but we need to convert this to E_unit (dyne/statC).

Wait, perhaps this approach is getting me stuck. Maybe I should look for a way to express the electric field in terms of the given quantities, using the correct units without getting lost.

Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that in Gaussian units, the electric field E is measured in dynes per statC, and the formula is E = (Q)/(r²) in cm and statC, but perhaps with a factor involved.

Wait, another approach: let's compute E using E = (k * Q) / r², but k in Gaussian units is different.

Wait, in Gaussian units, Coulomb's law is F = Q1 Q2 / r², so the k here is 1. So E = Q/(r²), but E's unit is (statC/cm²). But I need to relate that to dynes/statC.

Wait, perhaps 1 (statC/cm²) equals (dyne * cm²)/(statC * cm²) ) → No, I'm getting stuck again.

Wait, maybe I should think about it numerically. Let's compute the value without worrying about units for a second.

Given Q = 500 statC, r = 10 cm.

E = 500 / (10)^2 = 500 / 100 = 5.

So E is 5 (statC/cm²). But the options are in dyne/statC. So 5 (statC/cm²) = ? dyne/statC.

Wait, perhaps I can find the conversion between (statC/cm²) and (dyne/statC).

Given that 1 dyne = (statC)^2 / cm² → from Coulomb's law, F = Q^2 / r^2 → so unit-wise, dyne = (statC)^2 / cm².

So, 1 (statC/cm²) is (statC/cm²) → and dyne is (statC^2/cm²).

So, 1 (statC/cm²) = (1/dyne) * statC.

Wait, because 1 dyne = (statC^2/cm²) → so 1 (statC/cm²) = (1/dyne) * statC.

So E in (statC/cm²) is 5. So 5 (statC/cm²) = 5 * (1 (statC/cm²)).

But 1 (statC/cm²) equals (1 dyne)^-1 * statC.

So 5 (statC/cm²) = 5 * (1 dyne)^-1 * statC.

Which is 5/(1 dyne) * statC.

Hmm, but that seems off. Let me try another approach.

Wait, E is 5 (statC/cm²). We want E in dyne/statC.

So, 5 (statC/cm²) = 5 * (statC/cm²) * (cm²/dyne) * (dyne/(statC)) * (statC).

Wait, that's not making sense. Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the relation between these units.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the value of 1 (statC/cm²) in terms of dyne/statC.

Wait, from Coulomb's law, F = Q1 Q2 / r² → unit-wise, [F] = [Q]^2 / [r]^2 → [dyne] = [statC]^2 / [cm]^2.

So, [statC]^2 = [dyne] [cm]^2.

Taking square roots: [statC] = sqrt( [dyne] [cm]^2 ) = [cm] sqrt([dyne]).

But that's probably not helpful. Alternatively, solving for [dyne]:

[dyne] = ([statC]^2) / [cm]^2.

So, 1 [statC]^2 = 1 [dyne] [cm]^2.

Hmm, so 1 [statC]/[cm]^2 = 1 [dyne]^½ / [cm].

Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of the units as follows:

E has units of dyne/statC, which is (g cm/s²)/statC.

E is calculated as Q/(r²) → (statC)/(cm²).

So, to convert (statC/cm²) to (dyne/statC), I need to find how many (dyne/statC) are in 1 (statC/cm²).

So, 1 (statC/cm²) = X (dyne/statC).

So, X = [1 (statC/cm²)] / [1 (dyne/statC)].

But [dyne] = [statC]^2/[cm]^2.

So, substituting, X = (statC/cm²) / ( (statC^2/cm²)/statC ) )

Wait, let me compute the denominator: (dyne/statC) = ( [statC^2/cm²] ) / [statC] ) = [statC/cm²].

So, X = (statC/cm²) / (statC/cm²) ) = 1.

Wait, that can't be right. Because that would imply that 1 (statC/cm²) = 1 (dyne/statC), which would mean E is 5 dyne/statC.

But that seems too straightforward. Let me verify.

Because E = Q/(r²) = 500/(10 cm)^2 = 5 (statC/cm²).

And since 1 (statC/cm²) equals 1 (dyne/statC), then E is 5 dyne/statC.

So the answer would be option A: 5 dyne/stat-coul.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because when I think about the units:

E in Gaussian units is given by E = F/q → F in dynes, q in statC → E in dyne/statC.

But E is also given by E = Q/(r²) in Gaussian units, which would have units (statC/cm²).

So to reconcile these, (statC/cm²) must be equivalent to (dyne/statC).

Which would require that (statC/cm²) = (dyne/statC) → cross-multiplying:

(statC)^2 = (dyne) (cm²).

Which is consistent with Coulomb's law, because F = Q1 Q2 / r² → dynes = (statC)^2 / cm² → (statC)^2 = dyne cm².

So, yes, that's correct.

Therefore, E in (statC/cm²) is the same as (dyne/statC), because (statC/cm²) = (dyne cm² )^(1/2) / cm² → wait, perhaps that's not the right way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can accept that when you compute E as Q/(r²) in Gaussian units, the result is in (statC/cm²), which is the same as (dyne/statC), because of the way units are defined.

Thus, the answer is 5 dyne/statC, which is option A.
</think>

To determine the intensity of the electric field 10 cm from a negative point charge of 500 stat-coulombs in air, we use the formula for the electric field in Gaussian units:

\[
E = \frac{Q}{r^2}
\]

Here:
- \( Q = 500 \, \text{stat-coulombs} \) (the charge),
- \( r = 10 \, \text{cm} \) (the distance from the charge).

Substituting the values:
\[
E = \frac{500}{10^2} = \frac{500}{100} = 5 \, \text{stat-coulombs/cm}^2
\]

In Gaussian units, the electric field \( E \) has units of \(\text{dyne/stat-coulomb}\). Since the calculation already yields \( 5 \, \text{stat-coulombs/cm}^2 \), and this is equivalent to \( 5 \, \text{dyne/stat-coulomb} \) in Gaussian units, the intensity of the electric field is:

\[
E = 5 \, \text{dyne/stat-coulomb}
\]

Thus
