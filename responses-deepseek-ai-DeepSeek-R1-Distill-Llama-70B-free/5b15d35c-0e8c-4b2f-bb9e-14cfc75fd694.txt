Following the divorce, the husband was arrested and charged with embezzling funds from his employer during a two- year period. In preparing for trial, the prosecuting attorney interviewed the wife, who stated that during their marriage, the husband admitted committing the embezzlement. This jurisdiction has adopted both the common-law marital and spousal privileges. At the husband's trial, the wife is called to testify regarding statements the husband made to her during the marriage regarding commission of the crime. Upon objection by the husband's attorney, the wife's testimony will be

C: inadmissible, because the husband did not waive his right to marital or spousal privileges.
D: inadmissible, under either the marital or spousal privileges.
E: admissible, under the spousal privilege but not admitted under the marital privilege.
F: admissible, because the marital and spousal privileges do not apply to financial crimes.
G: admissible, because the embezzlement was not a crime committed against the wife.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about marital and spousal privileges in the context of a criminal trial. I'm a bit rusty on evidence law, but let's try to work through this step by step.

First, the scenario. A husband and wife were married for ten years. The wife divorced him after finding out he was having an affair. After the divorce, the husband gets charged with embezzlement. The wife tells the prosecuting attorney that during their marriage, the husband admitted to committing the embezzlement. Now, the jurisdiction has both the common-law marital and spousal privileges. At the husband's trial, the wife is called to testify about these statements, and the husband's attorney objects. The question is whether her testimony is admissible.

I remember that there are two main privileges here: the marital communication privilege and the spousal testimonial privilege. Let me try to recall what each entails.

The marital communication privilege, I think, protects confidential communications made between spouses during the marriage. So, if one spouse tells the other something in confidence, that can't be disclosed in court. But this applies only to communications made during the marriage. Also, I remember that this is a privilege that can be invoked by either spouse, but it's not absoluteâ€”there are exceptions, like for crimes against the other spouse or for certain criminal cases.

Then there's the spousal testimonial privilege, which is a bit different. I believe this one prevents one spouse from testifying against the other in a criminal trial. But this privilege only applies if the spouse is being called to testify by the prosecution, not if the defense calls them. Also, this privilege can be waived by the testifying spouse, but the other spouse can invoke it to prevent the testimony.

Wait, but in this case, the wife is being called by the prosecution, right? So the husband's attorney is objecting. So the husband is invoking both privileges.

Let me think about each privilege.

Starting with the marital communication privilege. The statements were made during the marriage, so that's when they were confidential. The issue is whether this privilege applies after the marriage ends. Because the couple is now divorced. But I think the marital communication privilege applies to communications made during the marriage, regardless of whether they're still married. So even after the divorce, the wife can't testify about those confidential communications.

Then, the spousal testimonial privilege. This one is about the spouse testifying against the other. But I remember that this privilege is not absolute either. It's based on the idea that the state shouldn't disrupt the marital relationship by forcing one spouse to testify against the other. However, I think this privilege doesn't apply in certain situations, like when the crime is against the testifying spouse or maybe in cases where the communication itself is about a future crime.

Wait, but in this case, the crime is embezzlement, which is against the employer, not the wife. So perhaps that exception doesn't apply.

But wait, I also remember that some jurisdictions have different rules. For example, the spousal testimonial privilege usually applies only when the spouse is testifying about events that occurred during the marriage. But I'm not sure about that.

Another angle: the marital communication privilege can be invoked by either spouse to prevent the other from testifying about confidential communications. But if the witness spouse (here, the wife) is willing to testify, can she be compelled to do so despite the husband's objection? Or does the husband have the right to prevent her from testifying about those communications?

Wait, no. The marital communication privilege is held by both spouses, so either can assert it. So if the husband objects, the wife can't testify about those communications.

But I also need to consider exceptions. For the marital communication privilege, I think there's an exception when the communication relates to a crime in which the other spouse was a victim. But here, the crime is embezzlement against the employer, not the wife. So that exception wouldn't apply. So the communication about the embezzlement would be protected.

As for the spousal testimonial privilege, it's about testifying against the other spouse. But this privilege is not recognized in federal courts and some states have abolished it. However, the question says this jurisdiction has both privileges, so we have to consider it.

Wait, but the spousal testimonial privilege typically applies when the spouse is being asked to testify against the other. But in this case, the wife is being called by the prosecution to testify against her ex-husband. So the husband's attorney would object, invoking the spousal testimonial privilege.

But I think the spousal testimonial privilege applies only during the marriage, not after. Because once they're divorced, the policy reasons for the privilege don't apply anymore. So in some jurisdictions, the spousal testimonial privilege doesn't apply after the marriage ends. So the wife could be compelled to testify against her ex-husband.

Wait, but the other part is that the marital communication privilege applies regardless of the current marital status. So the statements made during the marriage would still be protected, even after the divorce.

So putting it together: the husband's attorney is objecting on both grounds. So the marital communication privilege would prevent the wife from testifying about the statements, because they were confidential communications made during the marriage. The spousal testimonial privilege, however, might not apply because they're now divorced, so that privilege wouldn't prevent her testimony.

Alternatively, if the spousal testimonial privilege applies even after the divorce, then the testimony would be inadmissible on that ground as well.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline each privilege.

Marital Communication Privilege:
- Protects confidential communications between spouses made during the marriage.
- Applies even after the marriage ends.
- Can be invoked by either spouse to prevent the other from testifying about those communications.
- Exceptions may include when the communication relates to a crime against the spouse or in certain criminal cases, but in this scenario, the crime is against the employer, so the exception doesn't apply.

Spousal Testimonial Privilege:
- Prevents a spouse from testifying against the other in a criminal trial.
- Typically applies only during the marriage; once divorced, the privilege doesn't apply.
- So in this case, since they're divorced, the spousal testimonial privilege wouldn't prevent the wife's testimony.

So in this scenario, the wife's testimony about the husband's admissions would be protected under the marital communication privilege. Therefore, the testimony is inadmissible because the husband can assert that privilege.

Looking at the options:

Option D says "inadmissible, under either the marital or spousal privileges." So because marital applies, the testimony is inadmissible.

Option I says "inadmissible because the husband's admission was a private conversation between spouses." That seems to align with the marital communication privilege.

Wait, but let me check the answer options again.

Option D: inadmissible under either privilege.

Option I: inadmissible because it was a private conversation.

Wait, the question is about which privilege applies. The marital communication privilege would render the testimony inadmissible because the statement was a confidential marital communication. The spousal testimonial privilege may not apply after the divorce.

So the correct ground is the marital communication privilege, making the testimony inadmissible.

So looking at the options, the options that address this are:

Option D: inadmissible under either.

Option I: inadmissible because it was a private conversation.

Wait, but the spousal testimonial privilege would not prevent the testimony because they're divorced. So only the marital communication privilege applies, making the testimony inadmissible.

So the correct answer would be that the testimony is inadmissible under the marital privilege, but perhaps not under the spousal (since they're divorced).

Wait, but the question says the jurisdiction has both privileges. So the husband's attorney is objecting under both.

If the marital communication privilege applies, then the testimony is inadmissible regardless of the spousal privilege. So the correct reasoning is that the marital communication privilege makes it inadmissible.

Looking back at the options, option D is inadmissible under either, but if only the marital applies, perhaps the answer would be D because both privileges could apply, but in reality, only one.

Wait, no. Because the spousal testimonial privilege may not apply after the divorce. So the correct reason is the marital communication privilege, making the testimony inadmissible under that.

So looking back at the options, which ones say it's inadmissible because of the marital privilege.

Option D says inadmissible under either.

Option I says because it was a private conversation, which would relate to the marital privilege.

Wait, the question is whether both privileges apply. Since they are divorced, the spousal testimonial may not apply, but the marital communication does.

So the testimony is inadmissible under the marital privilege. So the option that says it's inadmissible under the marital privilege would be the answer. However, looking at the options:

Option D says inadmissible under either, which would mean both. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, let's consider each option.

Option A: Admissible under both. No, because the marital privilege would block it.

Option B: Inadmissible because she learned after divorce. No, the timing of learning isn't the issue; it's when the statement was made.

Option C: Inadmissible because husband didn't waive. No, the husband is the one objecting, so he's asserting the privilege, so it's not about waiver.

Option D: Inadmissible under either. So, if either applies, then it's inadmissible. Since marital applies, this is correct.

Option E: Admissible under spousal, not marital. No, because marital applies.

Option F: Admissible because financial crimes. No, the type of crime doesn't affect the privilege here.

Option G: Admissible because not against wife. No, because marital privilege still applies.

Option H: Admissible because wife wasn't an accomplice. No, that's a different issue.

Option I: Inadmissible because private conversation. Yes, that's the marital communication.

Option J: Admissible under marital but not spousal. No, because marital applies, making it inadmissible.

Wait, but the question is, which option is correct. So if the testimony is inadmissible because of the marital privilege, then option D says it's inadmissible under either. But option I says it's inadmissible because it was a private conversation, which is the reason the marital privilege applies.

Wait, in the scenario, the wife is being called to testify about statements made during the marriage. So the marital communication privilege would prevent that testimony. So the correct answer would be that the testimony is inadmissible under the marital privilege.

Looking at the options, option D says inadmissible under either, which includes marital. Option I gives a reason that aligns with the marital privilege.

So between D and I.

Option I says, "inadmissible because the husband's admission was a private conversation between spouses." That's exactly the marital communication privilege. So the testimony is inadmissible under the marital privilege, making option I the correct answer.

Wait, but the options are about which is the correct legal conclusion. So the correct answer is that it's inadmissible under the marital privilege. So option D says inadmissible under either, which includes marital. So D could be correct as well.

Alternatively, perhaps both privileges apply, but I think only the marital does because the spousal testimonial may not apply after the divorce.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of it another way. The marital communication privilege applies to confidential communications made during the marriage, regardless of whether they're still married. So even after the divorce, the wife can't testify about those statements because they were confidential marital communications. So the testimony is inadmissible because of the marital privilege.

So the correct answer is inadmissible under the marital privilege. Looking at the options, option D says inadmissible under either, but option J says admissible under marital but not spousal, which doesn't make sense because it's inadmissible.

Wait, no. Option D says inadmissible under either. So if either privilege applies, the testimony is inadmissible. Since the marital applies, it's inadmissible. So D is correct.

Alternatively, option I explains why it's inadmissible under the marital privilege. So I think the correct answer is D or I.

Wait, but the answer options are about the application of the privileges. So the correct reasoning is that the testimony is inadmissible because of the marital communication privilege, so the correct answer would be I, which states that it's inadmissible because the conversation was private between spouses.

Wait, but the way the options are phrased, option D says inadmissible under either, and option I gives a reason based on the marital privilege. So perhaps the correct answer is D, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the spousal testimonial privilege doesn't apply because they're divorced. So only the marital communication applies, making the testimony inadmissible. So the correct answer would be that it's inadmissible under the marital privilege, which would make option D incorrect because it says under either, but perhaps option D is the correct choice because it's inadmissible under at least one of them.

Wait, perhaps I should recall the rules more accurately.

In common law, the marital communication privilege covers confidential statements made during the marriage, and it's available even after the marriage ends. So the fact that they're divorced doesn't matter; the statements are still protected.

The spousal testimonial privilege, on the other hand, is about testifying against the spouse. But in this case, since they're divorced, the spousal testimonial privilege may not apply. So the only applicable privilege is the marital communication one.

Therefore, the testimony is inadmissible because of the marital communication privilege, making the correct answer the option that says it's inadmissible under the marital privilege.

Looking again, option D says "inadmissible, under either the marital or spousal privileges." Since marital applies, it's inadmissible under that, so D is correct. Alternatively, option I explains the reason, making it correct as well.

Wait, but the question is about which option is correct in terms of admissibility. So if the marital applies, the testimony is inadmissible, so the correct answer is that it's inadmissible under the marital, so perhaps option D is correct because it's inadmissible under either, but since only marital applies, maybe the answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D because it's inadmissible under either, and the marital applies.

I think the correct answer is D, but I'm a bit uncertain. Alternatively, perhaps it's I.

Wait, another way. The options are:

D: inadmissible under either.

I: inadmissible because it was a private conversation.

If the only reason it's inadmissible is because of the marital privilege (the private conversation), then I is correct. But the question is about whether both privileges apply. Since the spousal testimonial may not apply post-divorce, only the marital does. So the correct answer would be that the testimony is inadmissible under the marital privilege, making option D incorrect if it's considering both, but perhaps D is correct because it's inadmissible under at least one.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating. The key points are:

- Marital communication privilege applies to statements made during the marriage, even after divorce.

- Spousal testimonial privilege may not apply after divorce.

So the testimony is inadmissible because of the marital communication privilege. So the reason is that the statements were confidential marital communications.

Looking at the options, option I states that, so I think the correct answer is I.

But wait, option D says inadmissible under either, which would include the marital. So both could apply, but perhaps only the marital does, making D correct because it's inadmissible under at least one.

I'm getting stuck, but I think the correct answer is D or I. Let me think again.

The question is asking whether the testimony is admissible or not. The key is that the statements were made during the marriage, and the marital communication privilege applies. So the testimony is inadmissible.

So the answer should be that the testimony is inadmissible under the marital privilege. Looking at the options, option D says inadmissible under either, which would include the marital. So D would be correct.

But wait, perhaps the spousal testimonial privilege doesn't apply because they're divorced. So the testimony is inadmissible only under the marital privilege. So the correct answer would be that it's inadmissible under the marital, making option D correct because it's inadmissible under either.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D because even if only one applies, it's inadmissible.

I think the correct answer is D: inadmissible under either the marital or spousal privileges.

Wait, but the spousal may not apply. So perhaps the correct answer is D because it's inadmissible under the marital, which is one of the options in D.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is I because it's the reason for the marital privilege.

I'm a bit torn, but I think the correct answer is D because the statement is protected under the marital communication privilege, making it inadmissible, and the option D covers that scenario by stating inadmissible under either.

The question revolves around the admissibility of a wife's testimony regarding statements her ex-husband made during their marriage about committing embezzlement. The jurisdiction recognizes both the marital communication privilege and the spousal testimonial privilege. The husband's attorney objects to the testimony, and the analysis focuses on whether these privileges apply.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Marital Communication Privilege**:  
   - Protects confidential communications made between spouses during the marriage.  
   - Applies regardless of whether the marriage has ended, so the wife cannot testify about the husband's admissions made during the marriage.  
   - There is no exception here because the crime (embezzlement) was not committed against the wife.  

2. **Spousal Testimonial Privilege**:  
   - Prevents one spouse from testifying against the other in a criminal trial.  
   - Typically applies only during the marriage. Since the couple is divorced, this privilege likely does not apply in this case.  

### Evaluation of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. The testimony is not admissible under both privileges because the spousal testimonial privilege likely does not apply post-divorce.  
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The timing of when the wife learned about the embezzlement is irrelevant; the focus is on when the statements were made.  
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The husband is asserting the privilege, so waiver is not the issue.  
- **Option D**: Correct. The testimony is inadmissible under the marital communication privilege, and this option correctly states that it is inadmissible under either privilege.  
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The testimony is not admissible under the spousal privilege, and the marital privilege applies.  
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The type of crime (financial) does not negate the marital communication privilege.  
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The marital privilege applies regardless of whether the crime was against the wife.  
-
