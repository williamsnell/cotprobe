Okay, so I have this question about the movie 'West Side Story' and I need to figure out who kills Tony at the end. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, but let's think this through step by step.

First, I remember that 'West Side Story' is a musical, a modern retelling of Shakespeare's 'Romeo and Juliet' set in New York City. The main characters are Tony and Maria, who are from rival gangs. Tony is part of the Jets, and Maria's brother is the leader of the Sharks, the opposing gang.

In the original 'Romeo and Juliet,' Romeo kills Tybalt and then is killed by Paris in the tomb, but I think the adaptation might have some differences. So in 'West Side Story,' the conflict between the Jets and the Sharks drives the plot.

I recall that there's a big rumble where the two gangs fight. In that fight, Bernardo, who is Maria's brother and the leader of the Sharks, kills Riff, the leader of the Jets. Then, in a fit of rage, Tony kills Bernardo. That's a key point because Tony's actions here set off a chain of events.

After killing Bernardo, Tony goes into hiding. Maria tries to help him, but the situation gets more tense. Now, towards the end, I think there's a scene where Chino, who is a Shark and had a crush on Maria, is seeking revenge because Tony killed Bernardo. So Chino is out to get Tony.

Wait, but in the end, what happens? I think Tony dies, but who actually does it? I remember that in the stage version, Chino shoots Tony. But I'm not entirely sure if that's how the 1961 film version goes. Let me try to visualize the ending.

In the movie, after Tony and Maria plan to run away, Chino confronts Tony. There's a scene where Tony is walking, thinking that everything will be okay because he's made peace, but then Chino appears and shoots him. So Tony dies from the gunshot wound.

So looking at the options, the choices are:

A: He kills himself - No, Tony doesn't commit suicide.

B: Riff - Riff was killed by Bernardo earlier, so he can't be the one.

C: Chino - This seems right because Chino was seeking revenge.

D: Officer Krupke - He's a cop, but I don't think he kills Tony.

E: Lieutenant Schrank - Also a cop, but not the killer.

F: Bernardo - He was killed by Tony, so he's dead before the end.

G: Nobody, he survives - No, I'm pretty sure Tony dies.

H: Maria - No, Maria loves Tony; she wouldn't kill him.

I: Doc - Doc is the owner of the drugstore, not involved in the violence.

J: Anita - She's a friend of Maria's, but she's not the one who kills Tony.

So the correct answer must be C: Chino.

The correct answer is C: Chino. 

Chino kills Tony in the film 'West Side Story' as an act of revenge for Tony killing Bernardo. 

Answer: C
