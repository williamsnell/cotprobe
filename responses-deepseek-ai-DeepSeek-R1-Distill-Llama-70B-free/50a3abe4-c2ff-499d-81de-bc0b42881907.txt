Okay, so I've got this Bayesian network question, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by understanding the structure of the network given.

The network is H -> U <- P <- W. Hmm, I think that means the nodes are connected as follows: H is connected to U, and both H and U are connected to P, but wait no, wait. Wait, the structure is H → U ← P ← W. So U is connected to both H and P, and P is connected to W. So the nodes are H, U, P, W. Let me draw this out mentally.

So the structure is H points to U, and P points to U. Also, P is pointed to by W, so W → P → U, and H → U. So the connections are: W→P, P→U, H→U. So the network looks like W and H both lead into P and U respectively, but P also leads into U.

Wait, no, no. Let me get this right. The notation is H → U ← P ← W. So that's H and P both pointing to U, and W pointing to P. So the structure is:

- W → P → U
- H → U

So the parent nodes are W for P, P and H for U, and U has no children. So the Bayesian network has four nodes: W, P, H, U.

Bayesian networks are directed acyclic graphs, and each node's probability is determined by its parent nodes. For each node, we need to define a conditional probability table (CPT), and the number of independent parameters depends on the number of possible states each variable can take and their parents.

But wait, the question is about the number of independent parameters needed. I remember that for each node, the number of parameters is equal to the product of the number of possible values of the node minus one, multiplied by the product of the possible values of each parent.

Wait, more accurately, for a node with k parents, if the node has m possible states and each parent has n_i possible states, then the number of parameters for that node's CPT is (m-1) multiplied by the product of the parents' possible states. Because for each combination of parent states, you need to specify the probability distribution for the node, which has m-1 independent parameters (since probabilities sum to 1).

But wait, I think each node's CPT requires (number of possible values of the node - 1) multiplied by the product of the possible values of its parents. Let me make sure.

Suppose a node Y has parents X1 and X2. If Y can be true or false (2 states), X1 has 2 states, X2 has 3 states. Then for each combination of X1 and X2: 2 * 3 = 6 combinations. For each, Y's CPT has 2-1=1 parameter (the probability of Y=true given the parents). So for Y, 6 * 1 =6 parameters.

Wait, but in that case, the number of parameters for Y would be (number of parents' combinations) multiplied by (Y's states -1).

Wait, more generally, for each node, the number of parameters is (m-1) * product of (k_i), where m is the number of states of the node, and k_i is the number of states for each parent.

So, applying this to each node in the given network.

First, I need to know how many states each node has. The question doesn't specify, so I think I have to assume that each node is a binary variable (since it's a common case unless stated otherwise). So each node has 2 states: true or false, 0 or 1, etc.

So let's proceed under that assumption.

Now, let's list each node and its parents:

1. W: No parents. So it's a root node.
2. P: Parent is W.
3. H: No parents. Another root node.
4. U: Parents are P and H.

Wait, no. Wait, the structure is H → U ← P ← W. So U has two parents: H and P. Because H points to U, and P points to U. And P's parent is W. So W → P → U, and H → U.

So the nodes and their parents:

- W: no parents.
- P: parent is W.
- H: no parents.
- U: parents are H and P.

Wait, no, no. Wait, the structure is H → U ← P. So U has two parents: H and P. And P has a parent W, so the structure is W → P → U and H → U.

So each node's parents:

- W: none.
- P: W.
- H: none.
- U: P and H.

Now, for each node, compute the number of parameters.

Assuming each node is binary (2 states).

1. W: It has no parents. So its CPT is just the prior probability. Since it's binary, the number of parameters is 1 (since P(W=true) is specified, and P(W=false) is 1-P(W=true)).

2. P: It has one parent, W. W is binary, so the number of combinations of parents is 2 (W=true or false). For each combination, P's CPT requires (2-1)=1 parameter. So total for P is 2 * 1 = 2 parameters.

3. H: It has no parents, same as W. So 1 parameter.

4. U: It has two parents, H and P. Each parent is binary, so the number of parent combinations is 2*2=4. For each combination, U's CPT requires (2-1)=1 parameter. So 4 * 1 =4 parameters.

So adding them up, W (1) + P (2) + H (1) + U (4) = 8 parameters in total.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check.

Wait, no. Wait, each node contributes as follows.

Wait, W: 1 parameter.

H: 1 parameter.

P: depends on W. So 2 parameters (because W has two possible states, each requiring a probability for P).

U: depends on H and P, each of which is binary. So 2 (H) * 2 (P) =4 possible parent combinations. Each combination gives a row in the CPT for U, and each row requires 1 parameter (since U is binary). So 4 * 1 =4 parameters.

So total parameters: 1 (W) +1 (H) +2 (P) +4 (U) =8.

But wait, the question is about the number of independent parameters. So perhaps I should recount.

Wait, but let me think again. Each node's CPT needs (number of parents' combinations) multiplied by (node's states -1).

So for W: 0 parents, so 1 state (Wait, no, W's CPT is just P(W) which is one parameter because it's binary. So 1 parameter.

H: same as W. 1 parameter.

P: has one parent W (binary), so for each state of W, P can have a probability. So for W=true and W=false, P's CPT has two entries, each requiring one parameter, so 2.

U: has two parents, H and P, each binary. So the number of parent combinations is 2 * 2 =4. For each, one parameter, so 4.

So 1+1+2+4=8.

Looking at the options, option D is 8.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again because sometimes I might have made a mistake in the structure.

Wait, the given network is H → U ← P ← W. So, H and P both point to U, and P is pointed to by W. So U's parents are H and P. P's parent is W. H has no parents. W has no parents.

So, the count as above.

Wait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Another way to think of it: each node's CPT has (product of number of states of parents) multiplied by (number of states of the node minus 1). For binary variables, each node contributes (product of parents' states) * (2-1) = product of parents' states.

So:

- W: no parents, so product is 1. 1 * 1 (since 2-1=1) → 1 parameter.
- H: same as W. 1 parameter.
- P: parents are W, which has 2 states. So 2 *1=2.
- U: parents are H and P, each 2 states. So 2*2=4. 4*1=4.

So again, 1+1+2+4=8.

So the correct answer should be 8, which is option D.

To determine the number of independent parameters needed for the Bayesian network \( H \to U \leftarrow P \leftarrow W \), we analyze the structure and compute the parameters for each node's conditional probability table (CPT). The network consists of four nodes: \( W, P, H, U \), with the following connections:

1. \( W \to P \to U \)
2. \( H \to U \)

Each node is assumed to be binary (2 states: true or false). The number of independent parameters for a node is calculated as:

\[
\text{Parameters for a node} = (\text{number of states of the node} - 1) \times (\text{product of the number of states of its parents}).
\]

### Analysis for Each Node:
1. **Node \( W \):**
   - No parents.
   - CPT requires 1 parameter (prior probability of \( W \)).

2. **Node \( H \):**
   - No parents.
   - CPT requires 1 parameter (prior probability of \( H \)).

3. **Node \( P \):**
   - Parent: \( W \) (binary, 2 states).
   - For each state of \( W \), \( P \) requires 1 parameter.
   - Total parameters: \( 2 \times 1 = 2 \).

4. **Node \( U \):**
   - Parents: \( H \) and \( P \) (both binary, 2 states each).
   - Number of parent combinations: \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \).
   - For each combination, \( U \) requires 1 parameter.
   - Total parameters: \( 4 \times 1 = 4 \).

### Total Parameters:
\[
\text{Total parameters} = 1 (W) + 1 (H) + 2 (P) + 4 (U) = 8.
\]

Thus, the Bayesian network requires **8 independent parameters**.
