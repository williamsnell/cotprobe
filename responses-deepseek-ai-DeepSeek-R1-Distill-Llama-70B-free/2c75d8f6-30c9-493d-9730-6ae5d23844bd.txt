Okay, so I've got this question about buffer overflow bugs in applications. Hmm, I remember that buffer overflow is a common security vulnerability. Let me try to think through this.

The question is asking why buffer-overflow may remain a bug if certain things aren't done fully. The options are from A to J. I need to figure out which one is the correct answer.

Wait, buffer overflow happens when more data is put into a buffer than it's designed to hold. This can cause the extra data to spill over into adjacent areas of memory, which can lead to crashes or even allow attackers to execute malicious code. So, preventing this usually involves some kind of checks during data input.

Looking at the options, I see options like boundary hacks, buffer checks, boundary checks, etc. So, boundary checks sound relevant because they determine if the data is within the allowed limits of the buffer.

Option F is buffer checks, which might be similar. Option G is boundary checks. I think boundary checks are more about ensuring data doesn't exceed the buffer's capacity, which directly relates to preventing overflow.

So, if boundary checks are not done fully, buffer overflow bugs can remain. That makes sense. So the correct answer should be G: boundary checks.

The correct answer is G: boundary checks. Buffer overflow occurs when excessive data exceeds a buffer's capacity, potentially causing memory corruption. Implementing boundary checks ensures data stays within buffer limits, preventing such overflows. Without these checks, the vulnerability can persist.

Answer: G
