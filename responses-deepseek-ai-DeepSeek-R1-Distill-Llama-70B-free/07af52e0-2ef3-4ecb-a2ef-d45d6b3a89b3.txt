Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about a practitioner's report on the application of agreed-upon procedures. Hmm, I remember that agreed-upon procedures (AUP) are a type of attestation service where the practitioner is engaged to perform specific procedures agreed upon by the user. But wait, I need to think about what the report should include.

The question is asking which statement should be included in the report. Let me look at the options one by one.

Option A: A statement that the practitioner performed an audit of internal control over financial reporting. Wait, no. AUP is different from an audit. In an audit, the practitioner gives an opinion, but in AUP, they just report the results based on agreed procedures. So A is probably not correct.

Option B: A statement that the practitioner has provided absolute assurance on the financial statements. Absolute assurance sounds too strong. I think AUP provides limited assurance, if any. So B is likely wrong.

Option C: A statement of scope limitation that will qualify the practitioner’s opinion. Hmm, in AUP, the report usually doesn't express an opinion but rather describes the procedures and findings. So if there's a scope limitation, maybe it's mentioned, but I'm not sure if it's about qualifying an opinion. Wait, in AUP, the practitioner doesn't give an opinion, so C might not fit.

Option D: A statement of negative assurance based on procedures performed. Negative assurance is when the practitioner states that nothing came to their attention that would indicate issues. But wait, no, in AUP, the report typically doesn't provide assurance. The procedures are performed, and the results are reported without assurance. So D might not be right either.

Option E: A statement describing the practitioner's personal opinion on the financial statements. No, because AUP reports don't include an opinion, just the facts from the procedures. So E is incorrect.

Option F: A statement that the practitioner has performed a comprehensive financial analysis. No, that's more like a different service, not related to AUP. So F is out.

Option G: A statement that the practitioner performed an examination of prospective financial statements. No, that's an examination, which is a different level of service. So G is incorrect.

Option H: A statement referring to standards established by the International Accounting Standards Board. IASB is about accounting standards, not auditing. The practitioner's report would refer to auditing standards, like those from the AICPA. So H is probably wrong.

Option I: A statement referring to standards established by the AICPA. Yes, because in the US, practitioners follow AICPA standards for attestation engagements, including AUP. The report should state that the engagement was conducted in accordance with AICPA standards. So I seems correct.

Option J: A statement claiming full responsibility for the accuracy of the financial statements. No, because in AUP, the practitioner doesn't take responsibility for the accuracy; they just report on the procedures applied. So J is wrong.

Wait, let me make sure. The report in AUP should include a statement that the procedures were performed in accordance with agreed-upon procedures established by the parties involved. Also, the report refers to the standards under which the engagement was conducted, which for a US practitioner would be the AICPA's standards. So the correct answer is I.

The correct answer is I.

**Explanation:**

In a practitioner's report on the application of agreed-upon procedures (AUP), the report must reference the standards under which the engagement was conducted. In the U.S., these standards are established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). The report typically includes a statement indicating that the procedures were performed in accordance with the agreed-upon standards. Other options, such as providing an opinion (A, B, C, D, E, G, J), performing a financial analysis (F), or referencing IASB standards (H), are not applicable to AUP engagements. Therefore, the correct statement to include is that the engagement was conducted in accordance with standards established by the AICPA.
