Question:

A seller and a buyer signed a contract of sale for improved real property. The contract contained a financing contingency for a certain percentage of the purchase price. The buyer obtained the requisite financing from a bank. At the closing, the buyer executed a note to the seller for a portion of the purchase price, which note was not secured by a mortgage. The buyer then executed a second note, secured by a mortgage to executed a second note, secured by a mortgage to the bank, applying the bank loan proceeds to the purchase price of the property. The bank had actual knowledge of the prior note to the seller. The bank promptly recorded its mortgage. The buyer is now in default on both notes. There is no applicable statute. Which party has priority?

Options:

A: The buyer, because he executed both notes.
B: The bank, because it provided financing for the purchase of the property.
C: The seller, because he retained a vendor's lien that was first in time.
D: The bank, because its loan satisfied the financing contingency in the contract of sale.
E: The seller, because the bank had actual knowledge of the seller's note.
F: The seller, because the buyer's note to him was not secured by a mortgage.
G: The bank, because it promptly recorded its mortgage.
H: The bank, because its note is secured by a purchase money mortgage.
I: The buyer, because he is the one in default on both notes.
J: The seller, because the bank's loan did not fully cover the purchase price.

Okay, so I've got this real property question here, and I'm a bit new to this stuff, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the situation is that a seller and buyer signed a contract for the sale of improved real property. The contract has a financing contingency for a certain percentage of the purchase price. Financing contingency usually means that the buyer has to secure a loan for part of the price, and if they can't get the loan, the contract might be canceled. But in this case, the buyer did get the financing from a bank. 

At closing, the buyer executed two notes. The first note was to the seller and wasn't secured by a mortgage. The second note was secured by a mortgage to the bank, and the bank's loan proceeds went towards the purchase price. The bank knew about the prior note to the seller. The bank recorded its mortgage promptly. Now, the buyer is defaulting on both notes, and there's no applicable statute. The question is about which party has priority.

Hmm, I remember that when there are multiple liens or mortgages on a property, the priority usually depends on the order in which they were recorded or created. But there might be exceptions, especially with purchase money mortgages.

So the seller has a note that's unsecured, and the bank has a mortgage which was recorded promptly. The bank had actual knowledge of the seller's note. 

Wait, but the bank's mortgage is a purchase money mortgage, right? Because the bank gave the loan for the buyer to purchase the property. Purchase money mortgages have priority over other liens, even if recorded later, in some cases. Or is it the other way around?

I think purchase money mortgages (like when the lender is the seller) have priority. But here, the seller's note isn't secured. So the bank's mortgage is a purchase money mortgage provided by a third party (the bank), not the seller. So maybe the bank's mortgage still has priority because it's a purchase money mortgage, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another point. The seller retained a vendor's lien. Vendor's lien arises when a seller provides financing and doesn't get paid. So if the seller took a note from the buyer, does that create a vendor's lien? I think a vendor's lien is an equitable lien that arises automatically when a seller finances part of the purchase price. But in this case, the note wasn't secured by a mortgage. So the seller's lien would be unrecorded, perhaps.

But the bank's mortgage was recorded. So in terms of priority, the general rule is "first in time, first in right," but there are exceptions like for purchase money mortgages.

Wait, but the bank's mortgage is a purchase money mortgage because it's directly related to the purchase of the property. Purchase money mortgages have priority over other liens, even if those other liens were created earlier. So even though the seller's note was first, if the bank's mortgage is a purchase money mortgage, it might take priority.

Alternatively, since the seller's lien isn't secured by a mortgage, perhaps it's not as strong as the bank's secured interest. But I'm getting a bit confused here.

Let me think again. The seller's note is not secured, so the seller has an unsecured claim. The bank has a secured mortgage. When the buyer defaults, the bank, as a secured creditor, would have priority over unsecured creditors. But wait, in terms of lien priority on the property, it's about the order of liens, not the security.

Wait, but the seller's note isn't secured, so the seller doesn't have a lien on the property. So the only lien on the property is the bank's mortgage. Therefore, the bank's mortgage would be the only lien, and thus have priority.

Wait, but the seller might have a vendor's lien. A vendor's lien is an equitable lien that arises when the seller provides part of the purchase price financing. So even if it's not recorded, it exists. But in terms of priority, liens are usually determined by recording. So if the seller didn't record the lien, does it still have priority?

I remember that vendor's liens are typically considered to arise at the time of the transfer, so they would have priority over subsequent liens, even if not recorded. But in this case, the bank's mortgage was recorded promptly. So the seller's vendor's lien would have priority over the bank's mortgage if the vendor's lien was created first.

Wait, but the bank had actual knowledge of the seller's note. So even if the vendor's lien wasn't recorded, the bank knew about it. But I'm not sure how that affects the priority.

Another angle: under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), but wait, this is real property, so probably under real property law, specifically mortgages and liens.

So, the key here is whether the seller's vendor's lien takes priority over the bank's mortgage.

In general, a vendor's lien is an equitable lien that arises when the purchase price is not fully paid and the seller provides credit. It's considered to attach to the property at the time of the conveyance. So if the seller gave a note (vendor's lien) at closing, that lien would attach to the property at that time. The bank's mortgage was taken later, when the buyer executed the second note and mortgage. So the vendor's lien would be first in time.

But wait, the bank's mortgage was for the purchase price. So the bank's mortgage is a purchase money mortgage, which is given at the same time as the purchase. Wait, but the bank's mortgage was for a loan that the buyer used to pay part of the purchase price. So it's a purchase money mortgage, but provided by a third-party lender. 

In some states, a purchase money mortgage (from a third party) has priority over a vendor's lien because it's necessary for the purchase. But I'm not sure if that's a universal rule.

Alternatively, the vendor's lien arises upon the transfer and has priority over any subsequent liens, even if those subsequent liens are purchase money mortgages.

Wait, but the bank's mortgage was recorded before the seller's lien was recorded. Wait, the seller didn't record anything because it's just a note without a mortgage. So the bank's mortgage was recorded promptly. So in terms of recording, the bank's mortgage would have priority over any unrecorded liens, except for certain exceptions.

But the seller's vendor's lien is an equitable lien that arises without recording. So even if it's not recorded, it's still valid between the parties. But in terms of priority against another lien, like the bank's, which was recorded, the recording act would determine priority.

Under the notice statute (if applicable), a subsequent purchaser who has notice of a prior unrecorded lien would take subject to that lien. But here, the bank had actual knowledge of the seller's note. So if the jurisdiction follows the notice statute, the bank's mortgage, even though recorded, would be subject to the seller's prior unrecorded vendor's lien because the bank had notice.

But the question says there's no applicable statute. Wait, the question says "no applicable statute," which probably means that we're to apply the common law, or perhaps it's a race-notice jurisdiction, but without any statute, maybe it's first in time.

Wait, but without a recording statute, the common law rule is that the first in time has priority. So if the seller's vendor's lien arose at the time of closing (when the note was executed), and the bank's mortgage was taken later, the seller's lien would have priority.

But the seller didn't record a mortgage. So how does that affect things? Because the bank did record their mortgage, but the seller's lien is unrecorded.

Wait, but the bank had actual knowledge of the seller's note. So under common law, if the bank had knowledge of the prior unrecorded lien, their later mortgage would still be subject to that prior lien.

So in that case, the seller's vendor's lien would have priority over the bank's mortgage because the bank knew about it, even though the seller didn't record it.

So looking at the options, option C says the seller has priority because he retained a vendor's lien first in time. But option E says the seller because the bank had actual knowledge.

Wait, but if the seller's lien was first in time and the bank had knowledge, then both C and E could be relevant. But the priority is based on the vendor's lien being first in time, regardless of the bank's knowledge, unless the recording act affects it.

Wait, but without a statute, the recording act doesn't apply. So the common law applies. At common law, a subsequent purchaser with notice of a prior unrecorded conveyance is bound by it. So if the bank had actual knowledge of the prior vendor's lien, their mortgage would be junior to the seller's lien.

Therefore, the seller's lien has priority because it was first in time, and the bank had notice, making the bank's mortgage subordinate.

Looking back at the options:

Option C: The seller, because he retained a vendor's lien that was first in time.

Option E: The seller, because the bank had actual knowledge of the seller's note.

So both might be correct, but which is the better answer.

Wait, the vendor's lien arises upon the execution of the note and transfer of the property. So it's first in time. The bank's mortgage comes after. Even if the bank didn't have knowledge, the vendor's lien would still have priority because it's first. But the bank's knowledge makes it so that even under a notice statute, their mortgage is junior.

But since the question states there's no applicable statute, we're under common law, where the first in time prevails, and the bank's knowledge makes it so that the bank can't claim priority despite recording later.

Wait, but under common law, the rule is "first in time, first in right." So regardless of recording, the first lien has priority. But in this case, the seller's lien was first, so it would have priority over the bank's, which came second.

But wait, the seller's note wasn't secured by a mortgage, so perhaps it's not a lien at all. Wait, a vendor's lien is an equitable lien, which doesn't require a mortgage. So the seller has a lien on the property despite not having a mortgage.

So in this scenario, the seller's vendor's lien is first in time, so it has priority over the bank's mortgage, even though the bank recorded their mortgage later and had knowledge.

So the correct answer would be C: The seller, because he retained a vendor's lien that was first in time.

Wait, but another thought: does the fact that the bank provided the financing to satisfy the financing contingency affect this? Option D says the bank because its loan satisfied the contingency. But I don't think that affects the priority of liens.

Alternatively, perhaps the bank's mortgage is a purchase money mortgage, which under some laws has priority over other liens, even if they're earlier. But I think that applies when the mortgage is from the seller, not a third party. So a third-party purchase money mortgage might not get the same priority as a seller's purchase money mortgage.

So, putting it all together, the seller's vendor's lien was first in time, so it has priority over the bank's mortgage, especially since the bank had actual knowledge of it.

Looking at the options, option C is about the vendor's lien being first in time, which seems correct. Option E is about the bank's knowledge, but without a statute, it's more about the order in time and the bank's knowledge making their lien junior under common law.

So, I think option C is the correct answer.

The question revolves around determining the priority of liens on improved real property when a buyer defaults on two notes: one to the seller (unsecured) and one to the bank (secured by a mortgage). The bank had actual knowledge of the seller's prior note and promptly recorded its mortgage. The key issue is whether the seller's vendor's lien or the bank's mortgage takes priority.

Under common law, the rule of "first in time, first in right" generally applies, meaning that the lien created first has priority. A vendor's lien is an equitable lien that arises when the seller provides financing for the purchase and is created at the time of the transfer of property. Here, the seller's note was executed at closing, creating a vendor's lien that predates the bank's mortgage. Although the seller's lien was not secured by a mortgage, it still exists as an equitable lien.

The bank's mortgage, while recorded promptly, was created after the seller's vendor's lien. Even though the bank's mortgage is a purchase money mortgage, this does not automatically grant it priority over the seller's lien, especially since the bank had actual knowledge of the seller's prior note. Under common law, a subsequent lienholder with notice of a prior unrecorded lien is subject to that lien.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The buyer's execution of both notes does not determine priority.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The bank's provision of financing does not automatically grant it priority over the seller's lien.
- **Option C**: Correct. The seller's vendor's lien was first in time and therefore has priority under the common law rule.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The bank's satisfaction of the financing contingency does not affect the priority of liens.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. While the bank's knowledge of the seller's note is relevant, the priority is determined by the vendor's lien being first in time.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The lack of a mortgage on the seller's note does not negate the existence of the vendor's lien.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The prompt recording of the bank's mortgage does not override the seller's prior equitable lien.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The bank's mortgage, as a third-party purchase money mortgage, does not automatically take priority over the seller's lien.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The buyer's default does not affect the priority of the liens.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The bank's loan not fully covering the purchase price is irrelevant to the priority issue.

The correct answer is **Option C**, as the seller's vendor's lien was first in time and therefore has priority over the bank's mortgage.

**Answer: C**
