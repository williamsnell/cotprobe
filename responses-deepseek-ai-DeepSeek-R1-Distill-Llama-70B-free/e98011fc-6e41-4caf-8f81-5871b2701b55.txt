Question:

It has been found that hours of recreation (r) and wages (W) have a direct effect on productivity (P), so that : P =ar+bW. In two surveys it was found that Survey 1P = 170 : r = 51 : W = 136 Survey 2P = 425 : r = 68 : W = 204 What are the values of a and b ?

Options:

A: a = 68, b = 204
B: a = 2, b = 1.25
C: a = 0, b = 3
D: a = 170, b = 425
E: a = 5, b = 2
F: a = 4, b = 1.5
G: a = 3, b = 0.5
H: a = -20, b = 8.75
I: a = 51, b = 136
J: a = 10, b = 0.85

Okay, so I've got this problem here about productivity being dependent on hours of recreation and wages. The formula given is P equals a times r plus b times W, right? So P = a*r + b*W. 

There are two surveys, each giving values for P, r, and W. I think I need to set up a system of equations using these two surveys to find the values of a and b. Let's see, the first survey has P=170, r=51, W=136. The second survey has P=425, r=68, W=204.

So, plugging the first set into the equation: 170 = a*51 + b*136. That's equation one. 

And the second set gives: 425 = a*68 + b*204. That's equation two.

Hmm, I need to solve these two equations for a and b. I'm a bit rusty on solving simultaneous equations, but I think substitution or elimination would work. Maybe elimination is easier here because the coefficients are manageable.

Let me write the two equations:

1) 51a + 136b = 170  
2) 68a + 204b = 425  

I think I can try to eliminate one of the variables. Let's see if I can manipulate them. Maybe multiply the first equation by something to make either a or b's coefficient match. Let's try to eliminate a. 

What's the least common multiple of 51 and 68? Let me see, 51 factors into 3*17, and 68 is 4*17, so LCM is 4*3*17= 204. So I can multiply the first equation by 4 and the second by 3 to make the coefficients of a 204 each.

Wait, let me check. 51 *4=204, and 68*3=204. Yes, that works.

So,

Multiply equation 1 by 4:  
204a + 544b = 680

Multiply equation 2 by 3:  
204a + 612b = 1275

Now subtract these two new equations to eliminate a. 

(Second equation minus first equation):

(204a - 204a) + (612b -544b) = 1275 -680  
0a +68b=595

So 68b=595. Let me solve for b. 

Divide both sides by 68:  
b = 595 /68. Let me compute that.

68 goes into 595. 68*8=544, subtract that from 595: 595-544=51. So 51/68. So that's 8.75. Wait, 51 divided by 68 is 0.75 exactly (since 68*0.75=51). So b=8 + 0.75 =8.75? Wait, wait no. Wait 595 divided by 68. Let me compute 68 *8=544, 595-544=51. 51/68 is 0.75. So 8.75. So b=8.75. Wait, but that can't be right because looking at the options, I don't see b=8.75 except in option H. But wait, let me check my calculations again because that seems high.

Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the subtraction step. Let me go back.

After multiplying:

Equation 1a: 204a +544b =680  
Equation 2a:204a +612b=1275  

Subtract equation 1a from equation 2a: 

(204a -204a) =0  
612b -544b =68b  
1275-680=595  

So yes, 68b=595. So b=595/68. Let's compute that. 68 times 8 is 544, 68*8.75 is 68*(8 + 0.75) = 544 +51=595. So yes, b=8.75. 

Now, plug this back into one of the original equations to find a. Let's pick equation 1: 51a +136b=170. We know b=8.75, so 136 *8.75. Let me compute that. 136 *8 is 1088, 136 *0.75 is 102, so total 1088+102=1190. 

So equation 1 becomes: 51a +1190 =170  
Wait, 51a =170 -1190 = -1020  
So a= (-1020)/51. Let's compute that. 51*20=1020, so a= -20. 

So a=-20 and b=8.75. Looking at the options, option H is a=-20, b=8.75. So the answer should be H.

To determine the values of \(a\) and \(b\) in the equation \(P = a \cdot r + b \cdot W\), we use the data from two surveys:

1. Survey 1: \(P = 170\), \(r = 51\), \(W = 136\)  
   Substituting into the equation:  
   \[
   170 = 51a + 136b \tag{1}
   \]

2. Survey 2: \(P = 425\), \(r = 68\), \(W = 204\)  
   Substituting into the equation:  
   \[
   425 = 68a + 204b \tag{2}
   \]

To solve this system of equations, we use the elimination method. First, we make the coefficients of \(a\) the same by multiplying:

- Multiply equation (1) by 4:  
  \[
  204a + 544b = 680 \tag{1a}
  \]

- Multiply equation (2) by 3:  
  \[
  204a + 612b = 1275 \tag{2a}
  \]

Next, subtract equation (1a) from equation (2a) to eliminate \(a\):  
\[
(612b - 544b) = 1275 - 680
\]  
\[
68b = 595
\]  
Solving for \(b\):  
\[
b = \frac{595}{68} = 8.75
\]

Now substitute \(b = 8.75\) back into equation (1) to solve for \(a\):  
\[
170 = 51a + 136 \cdot 8.75
\]  
First, calculate \(136 \cdot 8.75\):  
\[
136 \cdot 8 = 1088, \quad 136 \cdot 0.75 = 102, \quad 1088 + 102 = 1190
\]  
Substitute back:  
\[
170 = 51a + 1190
\]  
\[
51a = 170 - 1190 = -1020
\]  
\[
a = \frac{-1020}{51} = -20
\]

Thus, \(a = -20\) and \(b = 8.75\). Comparing these values to the options, the correct choice is:

**H: \(a = -20\), \(b = 8.75\)**
