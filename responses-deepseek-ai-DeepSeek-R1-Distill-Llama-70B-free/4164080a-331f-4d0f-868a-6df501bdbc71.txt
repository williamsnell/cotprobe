Okay, so I have this question about non-coding RNAs, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work it out. The question is asking which of the given options is not a non-coding RNA. Hmm, I remember that RNA can be coding or non-coding. Coding RNA is like mRNA, which carries the genetic information to make proteins. Non-coding RNAs don't code for proteins but have various other functions.

Let me look at the options one by one.

Option A: lncRNA. I think lnc stands for long non-coding RNA. Yeah, I remember that lncRNAs are a type of non-coding RNA, so A is a non-coding RNA.

Option B: piRNA. Piwi-interacting RNAs, if I'm not wrong. These are involved in gene silencing and defending against transposons. Definitely non-coding.

Option C: rRNA. Ribosomal RNA. This makes up a large part of the ribosome, which is involved in protein synthesis. Since it's structural and not coding for proteins, rRNA is non-coding. So C is non-coding.

Option D: snRNA. Snurps, right? They are involved in splicing pre-mRNA in the spliceosome. So they don't code for proteins, making D a non-coding RNA.

Option E: tRNA. Transfer RNA. It carries amino acids to the ribosome during protein synthesis. Definitely non-coding.

Option F: miRNA. MicroRNAs. They regulate gene expression by binding to mRNA. Non-coding.

Option G: siRNA. Small interfering RNAs. Also involved in gene silencing. Non-coding.

Option H: Ribozyme. Wait, ribozyme is an RNA enzyme. Since it's an enzyme, it's a type of RNA that can catalyze reactions. I think ribozymes are considered non-coding RNAs because they don't code for proteins. So H is non-coding.

Option I: mRNA. Messenger RNA. This is the coding RNA. It carries the genetic information from DNA to the ribosome for protein synthesis. So I is coding, not non-coding.

Option J: gRNA. Hmm, gRNA could be a bit tricky. I think it can refer to guide RNA, which is used in some contexts like in RNA editing or in certain types of RNA molecules that help in directing processes. Wait, or could it be something else? Oh, wait, in the context of the genetic code, gRNA is another term for tRNA because they have anticodon regions that guide amino acids. But wait, is there another type? Or perhaps, in other contexts like in CRISPR systems, gRNA is the guide RNA which is non-coding. Wait, but in standard terminology, I think gRNA is more commonly known as a type of non-coding RNA, like in the case of the guide RNA in some systems. Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing it with something else. No, wait, mRNA is the coding one. So if J is gRNA, then it's non-coding. So the only coding RNA in the options is I: mRNA.

Wait, but let me think again. gRNA could be a bit ambiguous. For example, in transfer RNA, some people might call them tRNA, but sometimes they might be referred to as gRNA because they 'guide' the amino acids. But I'm pretty sure in standard terminology, gRNA stands for a different type, like in the case of the RNA that guides the Cas9 enzyme in CRISPR, which is a non-coding RNA. So J is non-coding.

So the question is which is NOT a non-coding RNA. The only coding RNA is mRNA, which is option I. So the answer should be I.

The question asks which of the given options is not a non-coding RNA. Non-coding RNAs are RNA molecules that do not code for proteins but perform various regulatory and structural roles. Let’s analyze each option:

- **A: lncRNA** — Long non-coding RNA, a type of non-coding RNA.  
- **B: piRNA** — Piwi-interacting RNA, involved in gene silencing and non-coding.  
- **C: rRNA** — Ribosomal RNA, structural component of ribosomes, non-coding.  
- **D: snRNA** — Small nuclear RNA, involved in splicing, non-coding.  
- **E: tRNA** — Transfer RNA, carries amino acids during translation, non-coding.  
- **F: miRNA** — MicroRNA, regulates gene expression, non-coding.  
- **G: siRNA** — Small interfering RNA, involved in gene silencing, non-coding.  
- **H: Ribozyme** — RNA enzyme, non-coding.  
- **I: mRNA** — Messenger RNA, carries genetic information for protein synthesis, coding RNA.  
- **J: gRNA** — Guide RNA, used in processes like CRISPR, non-coding.  

The only coding RNA in the list is **mRNA (I)**, which carries genetic information for protein synthesis. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**I**

Answer: I
