Okay, so I've got this question about mass transfer coefficients for water vapor in air over two different geometries: a flat plate and a sphere. Hmm, I remember that mass transfer coefficients depend on the flow regime and the shape of the object. 

The question says the flow is turbulent, so I think that means we'll be using correlations suitable for turbulent flow. Oh right, for a flat plate in turbulent flow, the Nusselt number (which is analogous to the Sherwood number for mass transfer) is often calculated using the Dittus-Boelter equation or something similar. Wait, but wait, the Schmidt number comes into play here because we're dealing with mass transfer, not heat transfer.

The problem gives the velocity as 210 ft/sec, length of the plate is 2 ft. The pressure is 1 atm, and the temperature is 75°F. Also, the concentration of water vapor is very low, so P_bm/P ≈ 1, which I think means we can treat the mixture as having properties similar to air. So the properties would be evaluated at air's properties.

Wait, I need to remember the properties of air at these conditions. Let me think: at 75°F, which is about 24°C. The kinematic viscosity of air at around 25°C is roughly 0.000016 ft²/s. Wait, wait, 1 ft²/s is a big unit, but I'm pretty sure the kinematic viscosity ν_air is around 1.6e-5 ft²/s. Wait no, 0.000016 ft²/s is 1.6e-5, right? Because 0.000016 is 1.6 x10^-5.

Next, the Schmidt number for water vapor in air. I think Sc is around 0.6 to 0.7. Wait, let me get precise. I recall that the Schmidt number for water vapor in air at around these conditions is approximately Sc = 0.6. So I'll take Sc as 0.6.

The formula for the Sherwood number (Sh) for a flat plate in turbulent flow is Sh = 0.036 Re^(0.8) * Sc^(1/3). But wait, sometimes I've seen it as Sh = 0.023 Re^0.83 Sc^0.44 for higher Reynolds numbers, but maybe for lower Re it's different. Alternatively, for a flat plate with turbulent flow over the entire length, the average Sherwood number can be calculated using Sh = 0.036 Re^(0.8) Sc^(1/3).

So first, I need to calculate the Reynolds number for the flat plate. Re is (velocity * length) / kinematic viscosity.

Let me plug in the numbers. Velocity v is 210 ft/s, length L is 2 ft. ν_air is 1.6e-5 ft²/s.

Re = (210 * 2) / 1.6e-5 = (420) / 1.6e-5. Let me compute that.

420 / 1.6e-5 = 420 / 0.000016. Let me compute 420 / 0.000016. Well, 420 divided by 0.000016 is the same as 420 * (1 / 0.000016) )= 420 * 62500. Because 1/0.000016 is 62500. So 420 *62500 = 26,250,000. So Re is 26,250,000. That's a pretty high Reynolds number, so turbulent flow makes sense.

Now compute Sh using Sh = 0.036 * Re^0.8 * Sc^(1/3). So Re is 2.625e7.

Wait, Re^0.8: let's compute 26,250,000^0.8. Hmm, exponents can be tricky. Let me think about logarithms. Alternatively, I know that 10^8 is 1e8, so 2.625e7 is about 2.625 x 1e7. Let me compute log(2.625e7) is log(2.625) + 7*log(10)= approx 0.419 +7=7.419. So 0.8 times that is about 5.935. So 10^5.935 is roughly 8.56e5. So Re^0.8 is about 8.56e5.

Wait, but wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute 26,250,000^0.8. Let me think in terms of (2.625 x 10^7)^0.8 = 2.625^0.8 * (10^7)^0.8. 10^7^0.8 is 10^(5.6)= approx 3.98e5. 2.625^0.8: let me compute. 2.625 is between 2 and 3. Let me think, 2^0.8 is about 1.741, 3^0.8 is about 2.408. So 2.625 is closer to 2. So 0.8 * ln(2.625)= 0.8 * 0.962= ~0.77, e^0.77≈ 2.16. So 2.625^0.8≈ ~2.16.

So Re^0.8 ≈ 2.16 * 3.98e5 ≈ 8.60e5.

Sc is 0.6, so Sc^(1/3) is cube root of 0.6. Cube root of 0.6 is approximately 0.843.

So Sh = 0.036 * 8.6e5 * 0.843. Let me compute that.

0.036 * 8.6e5 = 0.036 * 860,000 = 30,960.

30,960 * 0.843 ≈ 26,120.

So Sh ≈ 26,120.

Now, Sherwood number Sh is defined as Sh = (k_c * L) / D, where D is the diffusion coefficient of water vapor in air.

Wait, but do I know D? Hmm, I don't have D given, so perhaps I can calculate it or find another approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can relate it via the Schmidt number, since Sc = ν / D. So D = ν / Sc.

Wait, yes. Because Sc = ν / D → D = ν / Sc.

So, Sh = (k_c * L) / D → k_c = Sh * D / L.

Substituting D = ν / Sc, we get:

k_c = Sh * (ν / Sc) / L.

So plugging in the numbers:

Sh ≈ 26,120.

ν is 1.6e-5 ft²/s.

Sc is 0.6.

L is 2 ft.

So,

k_c = 26120 * (1.6e-5 / 0.6) / 2.

Compute (1.6e-5 / 0.6) = (1.6 / 0.6) * 1e-5 ≈ 2.6667e-5.

Then, 26120 * 2.6667e-5 = let's compute that.

26120 * 2.6667e-5 → 26120 * 2.6667e-5 = (26120 * 2.6667) * 1e-5.

26120 * 2.6667 ≈ 26120 * (8/3) ≈ 26120 * 2.6667 ≈ 26120 * 2 =52240, 26120*0.6667≈ ~17,413 → total ~73953. So 73953 * 1e-5 = 0.73953.

Then, divide by 2: 0.73953 / 2 ≈ 0.3698 ft/s.

Wait, but wait a second, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait Sh is 26,120, which is correct?

Wait, let me recompute Sh:

Sh = 0.036 * Re^0.8 * Sc^1/3.

We had Re^0.8 ≈ 8.6e5, and Sc^(1/3)≈ 0.843.

So 0.036 * 8.6e5 = 0.036 * 860,000 = 30,960.

30,960 * 0.843 ≈ 26,120. So that's correct.

Then D = ν / Sc = 1.6e-5 / 0.6 ≈ 2.6667e-5 ft²/s.

So k_c = Sh * D / L = 26120 * (2.6667e-5) / 2.

Wait, let's compute 26120 * 2.6667e-5:

26120 * 2.6667e-5 = (26120 * 2.6667) * 1e-5.

26120 * 2.6667 ≈ 26120 * (8/3) ≈ 26120 * 2.6667 ≈ let's compute 26120 * 2 =52240, 26120 * 0.6667≈17,413, total 52240 + 17413 = 69,653. Multiply by 1e-5 → 0.69653.

Then divide by 2: 0.69653 /2 = 0.34826 ft/s.

Wait, earlier I got 0.3698 when I thought it was 0.73953/2, but that approach must have had a mistake. So perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me recompute.

Wait wait, another approach: 26120 * (2.6667e-5) = ?

Let me compute 26120 * 2.6667e-5:

26120 * 2.6667e-5 = ?

Let me compute 26120 * 2.6667e-5:

First, 26120 * 2.6667 = ?

Well, 26120 * 2 = 52240.

26120 * 0.6667 ≈ 26120 * 2/3 ≈ 17,413.333.

So 52240 + 17,413.333 = 69,653.333.

So 69,653.333 multiplied by 1e-5 is 0.69653333.

So 0.69653333 divided by 2 is 0.34826667 ft/s.

So approximately 0.348 ft/s. Hmm, but looking at the options, I don't see 0.348 as an option. Wait, the options for the flat plate in the choices are:

Option B: 0.516 for flat plate, 0.25 for sphere.

Option E: 0.312 flat, 0.156 sphere.

Option I: 0.450 and 0.225.

Wait, but 0.348 is close to 0.35. Let me see if any option is near that. Option E is 0.312, which is close but a bit lower.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating Sh or Re.

Wait, let me double-check the Re calculation. V=210 ft/s, L=2 ft, ν=1.6e-5 ft²/s.

Re = (210 * 2) / 1.6e-5 = 420 / 1.6e-5.

Let me compute 420 divided by 0.000016.

Well, 420 / 0.000016 = 420 * (1/0.000016) )= 420 * 62500 = 420 * 62500 = 26,250,000.

So Re=26,250,000. That's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should check the formula for Sh. Maybe I used the wrong correlation.

Wait, another formula for turbulent flow over a flat plate is Sh = 0.023 Re^0.83 Sc^0.44.

Wait, let me try that. So Sh = 0.023 * (Re)^0.83 * (Sc)^0.44.

Compute Re^0.83: Re is 2.625e7.

log(Re) = log(2.625e7) = log(2.625) +7 ≈ 0.419 +7 =7.419.

0.83 * 7.419 = 6.128.

10^6.128 ≈ about 1.34e6.

Because 10^6=1e6, and 10^0.128≈1.34.

So Re^0.83 ≈ 1.34e6.

Sc^0.44: Sc=0.6. Let me compute 0.6^0.44.

Take natural log: ln(0.6)= -0.5108. Multiply by 0.44: -0.2248. Exponentiate: e^-0.2248≈0.798.

So Sh = 0.023 * 1.34e6 * 0.798.

0.023 *1.34e6 = 30,820.

30,820 * 0.798 ≈ 24,600.

So Sh ≈24,600.

So then, Sh is about 24,600.

Then, k_c = Sh * D / L.

D is ν/Sc =1.6e-5 /0.6≈2.6667e-5.

So k_c = (24,600) * (2.6667e-5) / 2.

24,600 * 2.6667e-5 = ?

24,600 = 2.46e4.

So 2.46e4 * 2.6667e-5 = (2.46 * 2.6667) * 1e-1.

2.46 *2.6667 ≈ let's compute: 2 *2.6667=5.3334, 0.46*2.6667≈1.2267. Sum: 5.3334 +1.2267≈6.5601.

So 6.5601 * 1e-1=0.65601.

Divide by 2: 0.65601/2=0.328005 ft/s.

So approximately 0.328 ft/s.

Hmm, that's closer to 0.33, but the options don't have that. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 0.600 flat, 0.300 sphere.

B: 0.516, 0.25.

C: 0.25, 0.516.

D:0.400,0.200.

E:0.312,0.156.

F:0.25 both.

G:0.156,0.312.

H:0.516 both.

I:0.450, 0.225.

J:0.225,0.450.

None of these match 0.328. Hmm, maybe I'm using the wrong correlation. Another thought: perhaps for mass transfer in gases, the Schmidt number is around 1, so maybe using a different correlation?

Wait, no, we have water vapor in air, so Sc is about 0.6. So perhaps I should stick with that. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the exponent for Re.

Wait, perhaps the correct correlation is Sh=0.023 Re^0.83 Sc^(0.44).

Wait, let me double-check the exponents.

Wait, the Dittus-Boelter equation for heat transfer is Nu=0.023 Re^0.8 Pr^(0.33). For mass transfer, it would be Sh=0.023 Re^0.83 Sc^(0.44) for 0.6<Pr<100 or something like that.

Wait, perhaps I need to use a different exponent for Re. Maybe Re^0.8 instead of 0.83.

Alternatively, I've seen that for a flat plate in turbulent flow, the average Sherwood number can be given by Sh = 0.036 Re^0.8 Sc^(1/3), which I used earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should compute both ways and see which gives an option that matches.

First method gave 0.348, second method (with Sh=0.023 Re^0.83 Sc^0.44) gave 0.328.

Neither gives an option that's present. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the error is in the velocity or the length. Wait, part (a) is a flat plate 2 ft long, velocity is 210 ft/s. Yes.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider that the properties are evaluated at the film temperature. But since the bulk temperature is 75°F, which is about 24°C, and assuming the surface is probably at a similar temperature (since it's not given), the properties are correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the Chilton-Colburn analogy, which relates the Sherwood and Nusselt numbers. The analogy states:

j_m = j_h, where j is the Colburn factor.

The Colburn j factor for mass transfer is (Sh/(Re*Sc^(1/3))) * (μ/ρ) = j_m.

Wait, perhaps that's complicating things. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relation between mass and heat transfer coefficients.

But I'm getting stuck because my calculations aren't matching any of the options. Let me think about the options again.

Looking at the options, option B gives 0.516 for flat plate, which is higher than my calculations. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent when using the 0.036 correlation. Let me recompute Sh using Sh=0.036 Re^0.8 Sc^(1/3).

Re=2.625e7.

Re^0.8: Well, 2.625e7 is 2.625 x 1e7. So 1e7^0.8 is 10^(5.6)= approx 3.98e5 as before. 2.625^0.8: I think I did that earlier as about 2.16.

So Re^0.8=2.16 *3.98e5=8.60e5.

Sh=0.036 * 8.6e5 * 0.843 (since Sc^(1/3)=0.843).

0.036 *8.6e5=30,960.

30,960 *0.843= approx 26,120.

So Sh=26,120.

Then k_c=Sh*D/L.

D=ν/Sc=1.6e-5/0.6≈2.6667e-5.

k_c= 26120 *2.6667e-5 /2 = (26120 *2.6667e-5) /2.

26120 *2.6667e-5 = let's compute 26120 *2.6667e-5.

26120 *2.666
