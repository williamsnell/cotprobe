Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physiology question about stroke volume. Hmm, I remember that stroke volume is the amount of blood pumped by the heart with each beat. The question is asking what three factors regulate it. 

I think about the factors that influence how much blood the heart can pump each time. Oh right, there's preload, contractility, and afterload. Let me break them down. 

Preload is the initial stretching of the cardiac myocytes prior to contraction. It's like the amount of blood in the ventricles before they contract. If there's more blood, the heart stretches more and pumps more blood, thanks to the Frank-Starling law. So preload definitely plays a role.

Contractility refers to the strength of the heart's contraction. When the heart muscle contracts more forcefully, it pumps more blood. I remember that contractility can be influenced by things like sympathetic stimulation or certain drugs like digoxin. So contractility is another key factor.

Afterload is the resistance the ventricles must overcome to eject blood into the peripheral circulation. If the afterload is high, like in hypertension, the heart has to work harder to pump blood out. This would decrease stroke volume because it's harder to eject the blood. So afterload is the third factor.

Looking at the options, I need to find the one that includes these three. Let's see the options:

Option A: Blood volume, preload, afterload. Wait, blood volume is related to preload because preload is about the volume in the ventricle. So maybe blood volume isn't a direct factor but contributes to preload.

Option B: Blood pressure, heart rate, afterload. Blood pressure affects afterload, but heart rate is more about how often the heart beats, which relates to cardiac output but not directly stroke volume.

Option C: Afterload, cardiac output, blood volume. Cardiac output is the result of stroke volume and heart rate, so it's not a factor but an outcome.

Option D: Blood pressure, preload, cardiac output. Again, cardiac output isn't a factor, and blood pressure relates to afterload, not directly.

Option E: Preload, contractility, afterload. Yes, that's exactly the three I thought of.

Option F: Preload, blood volume, heart rate. Blood volume and heart rate don't directly regulate stroke volume; blood volume affects preload, and heart rate affects how many times stroke volume happens.

The other options don't seem to fit. So the correct answer must be E.

The three factors that regulate stroke volume are preload, contractility, and afterload. Preload refers to the initial stretching of cardiac myocytes before contraction, which influences how much blood the ventricles can pump. Contractility is the strength of the heart's contraction, determining how forcefully blood is pumped. Afterload is the resistance the ventricles must overcome to eject blood into the circulation, affecting the ease of blood ejection. Among the options provided, only Option E correctly lists these three factors.

Answer: E
