Okay, so I've got this question about neurotransmitters and the autonomic nervous system. Hmm, I remember that the autonomic nervous system has two main branches: the sympathetic and the parasympathetic systems. Both are involved in involuntary actions, like heart rate, digestion, etc.

The question is about noradrenaline being the neurotransmitter between which two structures. The options are A to J, each pairing different neurons.

First, I need to recall the structure of the autonomic nervous system. Both sympathetic and parasympathetic have a two-neuron chain leading from the central nervous system to the target organ. So, each has a preganglionic neuron and a postganglionic neuron.

Now, the neurotransmitters used in these systems. I think acetylcholine is the main neurotransmitter for the parasympathetic system, especially in the postganglionic neurons. But wait, for the sympathetic system, it's a bit different. The preganglionic neurons use acetylcholine, but the postganglionic ones use noradrenaline (also called norepinephrine) in most cases. 

So, noradrenaline is the neurotransmitter released by the postganglionic neurons of the sympathetic system. That means it's the chemical messenger between the postganglionic neurons and the target organs. 

Wait, but the question is phrased as "between which of the two structures." So the two structures would be the postganglionic neurons and the target organs.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option D is "sympathetic post-ganglionic neurons and target organs." That fits because noradrenaline is the neurotransmitter between those.

Alternatively, option C is between pre and post ganglionic neurons. But in the sympathetic system, the preganglionics release acetylcholine, which then acts on the postganglionics. So that's not where noradrenaline comes into play.

So the correct answer should be D.

Noradrenaline is a key neurotransmitter in the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system. It is primarily released by the postganglionic neurons of the sympathetic system to communicate with target organs. This interaction is crucial for various involuntary functions, such as increasing heart rate and preparing the body for "fight or flight" responses.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option D** correctly identifies that noradrenaline acts between sympathetic postganglionic neurons and target organs.
- Other options, such as **C**, refer to the connection between pre- and postganglionic neurons, where acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter, not noradrenaline.

Thus, the correct answer is:

D
