Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about how much you need to make annually to be in the top 1% of the richest people in the world as of 2020. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure about the exact figure, but I can try to reason it out.

First, I remember that being in the 1% globally is a much higher threshold than being in the 1% in a specific country, like the US. I think in the US, the top 1% earn several hundred thousand dollars a year, maybe around $500k or more. But globally, it's probably lower because many people around the world earn much less.

Wait, no, actually, wait. The global 1% would still be a high amount because it's considering all the rich people in the world. So maybe it's more than what I initially thought. I remember reading somewhere that to be in the top 1% globally, you don't need to be a millionaire, but it's still a significant amount.

I think the figure is somewhere around $50,000 to $100,000 a year. Let me think, if you make $50k in the US, that's a decent income, but globally, that might actually put you in a higher percentile because many countries have lower average incomes. But wait, the question is about the top 1%, so maybe it's higher than that.

I recall that in some sources, the threshold is around $50k. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, I've heard that the top 1% globally have around $70k or more. Wait, that might be for the top 0.5% or something.

Wait, let me try to break it down. The global median income is much lower. So if I'm in the top 1%, that's the highest earners. Let's think about it: in 2020, the world population was about 7.8 billion. So the top 1% would be about 78 million people. But how much do those 78 million people earn?

I think the actual number is around $50,000 to $70,000 per year. But I'm not 100% certain. Let me think about some examples. If someone makes $50k in a developed country, they're doing well, but globally, that might be in the top few percent. But for the top 1%, perhaps it's a bit higher.

Wait, I think I've read that the global top 1% threshold is approximately $50,000. So looking at the options, option B is $50k, option E is $100k, and option G is $75k. So which one is it?

I'm a bit confused because sometimes these figures can vary based on the source and the exact criteria used. Some might include wealth instead of income, but the question specifically mentions annual income.

Alternatively, I've heard that the top 1% globally have an income of around $70,000. So that would be option G. But I'm not entirely sure. Wait, another thought: perhaps it's lower because the cost of living in many countries is much lower, so even a moderate income in global terms could place someone in the top 1%.

Wait, maybe I should consider data from 2020. I think that according to some reports, the top 1% of earners globally have an income of around $50,000 or more. So that would point to option B.

But I'm a bit torn because I've also heard that the figure is higher. Let me try to think about it differently. The World Bank might have some data on this. If the global median income is around $2,000 to $3,000, then someone making $50k is way above that. So perhaps $50k is enough to be in the top 1%.

Alternatively, considering that some countries have much higher average incomes, like in the US, so maybe the global 1% is higher. Hmm.

Wait, I think I remember a specific figure from a few years ago. It was stated that to be in the top 1% globally, you needed around $50,000. So that would make option B the correct answer.

But wait, another angle: sometimes these numbers are adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP), which could change the threshold. However, the question doesn't specify, so I think it's referring to nominal income.

Putting it all together, I think the answer is B: $50,000.

As of 2020, to be among the richest one percent in the world, you would need an annual income of approximately $50,000. This figure is derived from considering the global income distribution, where the top 1% includes about 78 million people out of a world population of 7.8 billion. While some sources suggest slightly higher thresholds, $50,000 is a commonly cited estimate for the nominal income required to be in the top 1% globally. 

Answer: B
