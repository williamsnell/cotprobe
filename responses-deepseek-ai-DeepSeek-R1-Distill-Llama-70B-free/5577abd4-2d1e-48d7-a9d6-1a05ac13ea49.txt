Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Protocol 14 and its effects on the European Court of Human Rights. I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking which statement is false. The options are from A to J. Let me go through each option one by one and see what I remember about Protocol 14.

Starting with option A: Protocol 14 established the Human Rights Council. Wait, I think the Human Rights Council is part of the United Nations, not the Council of Europe. The Council of Europe has the European Court of Human Rights and the Commission. Oh wait, Protocol 14 actually abolished the Commission and made the Court permanent. So maybe A is false because the Human Rights Council was established by the UN, not Protocol 14. But I'm not 100% sure yet.

Option B: Protocol 14 mandated a two-judge formation for hearing admissibility cases. I'm trying to remember. I think before Protocol 14, admissibility was handled by a committee of three judges. Protocol 14 changed that. I believe it allowed for single-judge formations in some cases, but maybe two-judge for others. Not sure if B is correct or not.

Option C: Protocol 14 reduced the jurisdiction of the Court. Hmm, I don't think so. I recall that Protocol 14 was about streamlining the process, making the Court more efficient, but not reducing its jurisdiction. So C might be false, but I'm not certain yet.

Option D: It shortened the judicial term of office. Wait, I think the terms were increased, not shortened. Judges used to have terms of 6 or 9 years, and I think Protocol 14 extended them to 9 years or maybe even non-renewable terms. So D would be false if that's the case.

Option E: Introduced a requirement for unanimous decision-making in admissibility cases. I don't remember anything about unanimous decisions. Maybe it's the opposite—simplifying the process, so perhaps majority decisions. So E might be false.

Option F: Added a new admissibility criterion. I think Protocol 14 did introduce a new admissibility criterion related to whether the applicant has suffered a significant disadvantage. So F is correct, not false.

Option G: Eliminated the right to individual petition. No, that's a key part of the system. Protocol 14 wouldn't remove that right, so G is false. But wait, eliminating individual petitions would be a big change. I think the right remains, so G is definitely false. But wait, I thought the Commission was abolished, but the right to petition remains. So G is false—no, actually, G says "eliminated the right", which is not true, so G is a false statement.

Option H: Changed the committee from three judges to one. I think that's correct. Protocol 14 allowed for single-judge formations for certain admissibility decisions, so H is true.

Option I: Extended the judicial term of office. I thought this was the case. Before, judges had 6-year terms, and after Protocol 14, they became 9 years, or perhaps non-renewable. So I is true, meaning D is false because it says "shortened".

Option J: Abolished the Commission of Human Rights. Yes, that's correct. Protocol 14 did away with the Commission, making the Court the sole organ. So J is true.

Wait, going back to option A: Did Protocol 14 establish the Human Rights Council? No, the UN Human Rights Council was established in 2006, replacing the Commission on Human Rights. Protocol 14, which came into effect in 2010, reformed the European Court of Human Rights, not the UN body. So A is false because it incorrectly attributes the establishment of the UN body to Protocol 14.

So now, looking at all the options, the false statements would be the ones that are incorrect.

Let me recap:

A: False (it was the UN that created the HRC, not Protocol 14)
B: Maybe true, but I'm not sure. Protocol 14 introduced single-judge for some cases, but perhaps two-judge for others. Or maybe not. I'm a bit confused here.
C: Probably false. Protocol 14 didn't reduce jurisdiction, just streamlined.
D: False. Protocol 14 extended terms, not shortened.
E: Probably false. No requirement for unanimous decisions.
F: True. New admissibility criterion.
G: False. Right to petition wasn't eliminated.
H: True. Single-judge now possible.
I: True. Terms extended.
J: True.

So the question is which statement is false. The options include several, but the answer is one of them.

Wait, the question is which is false. So among the options, which one is incorrect.

Looking at each option again:

Option A: "Protocol 14 established the Human Rights Council." False, because it's the UN that did that.

Option D: "shortened... term of office." I believe it's the opposite; terms were extended, so D is false.

Option G: "eliminated the right to individual petition." No, the right still exists, so G is false.

Option C: "reduced the jurisdiction." I don't think so; jurisdiction was expanded or kept the same. So C is false.

Wait, but what exactly did Protocol 14 do?

From what I remember, Protocol 14 made several changes:

- Abolished the European Commission of Human Rights, making the Court the sole organ (so J is correct).
- Introduced a new admissibility criterion (F is correct).
- Allowed for single-judge decisions on admissibility (so H is correct).
- Extended the term of judges from 6 to 9 years (so I is correct, making D false).
- Removed the possibility of renewable terms, making them non-renewable.
- Did not reduce the Court's jurisdiction, so C is false.
- Did not eliminate individual petitions, so G is false.
- Did not establish the UN Human Rights Council, so A is false.

So the false statements are A, C, D, E, G.

But the question is which one of the following is false. So looking back at each option, only one is the correct answer.

Wait, the question is which statement is false. So among the options, I need to find which one is incorrect.

Looking again:

Option G: "Protocol 14 eliminated the right to individual petition." That's definitely false because the right remains. So G is false.

Option D: "shortened the judicial term of office." If Protocol 14 extended it, then D is false.

So both D and G are false statements. But the question is to pick one option as the false statement.

Wait, but perhaps I'm mistaken. Let me check each option again.

Option A: Established HRC. That's wrong. So A is false.

Option D: Shortened terms. That's wrong. So D is false.

Option G: Eliminated individual petition. Wrong, so G is false.

So all three are false. But the question says only one is the correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up some details. Let me think more carefully.

Protocol 14's main points:

- It came into force in 2010.
- Abolished the European Commission of Human Rights (so J is correct).
- Made the Court permanent.
- Introduced new admissibility criteria (F is correct).
- Allowed single-judge decisions for certain cases (H is correct).
- Extended judges' terms from 6 to 9 years (so I is correct, D is false).
- The right to individual petition remains, so G is false.
- It did not establish the UN HRC, so A is false.

So the options that are false are A, D, G.

But the question is which one is false. So perhaps the question includes only one false statement, but according to this, there are multiple. But that's not possible.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing terms. Let me think about each option.

Option A: Protocol 14 established the Human Rights Council.

No, the Human Rights Council is a UN body, created in 2006. Protocol 14 is about the European Court, so A is false.

Option B: Mandated two-judge for admissibility.

I think Protocol 14 allowed for single-judge, so B might be false, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe some cases are handled by two judges. I'm a bit unclear on this.

Option C: Reduced jurisdiction. I don't think so; it's about efficiency, not reducing jurisdiction. So C is false.

Option D: Shortened term. No, it extended, so D is false.

Option E: Unanimous decisions. I don't think so; perhaps it's majority. So E is false.

Option F: Added new admissibility criterion. Yes, so F is correct.

Option G: Eliminated individual petition. No, so G is false.

Option H: Changed to one-judge. Yes, so H is correct.

Option I: Extended term. Yes, so I is correct.

Option J: Abolished Commission. Yes, so J is correct.

So, looking for the false statements, options A, C, D, E, G are false.

But the question asks for which one is false, so perhaps the intended answer is G. Because the right to individual petition remains a cornerstone.

Wait, but the question gives only one correct answer. So perhaps the intended answer is G.

Alternatively, perhaps D is the intended answer.

Wait, the option says "shortened the judicial term of office." If Protocol 14 extended the term, then D is false.

So among the options, multiple are false, but perhaps the question is designed such that only one is correct as the false statement.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in understanding the options.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is G because it's a very significant change if individual petitions were eliminated, which they weren't. So G is a false statement.

But I'm a bit confused because D is also false.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is E.

Wait, Protocol 14 introduced a new admissibility criterion, so F is correct. Option E says it introduced a requirement for unanimous decisions in admissibility. I don't think that's the case; perhaps decisions can be by a majority.

So E is false.

This is getting complicated. Let me try to find the correct answer.

The question is which statement is false.

Looking up, Protocol 14's key changes:

1. Abolished the Commission, making the Court the sole organ (so J is correct).
2. Judges' terms extended from 6 to 9 years, non-renewable (so I is correct, D is false).
3. Introduced single-judge formations for certain admissibility decisions (so H is correct).
4. Introduced a new admissibility criterion (so F is correct).
5. The right to individual petition remains (so G is false).
6. It did not establish the UN HRC (so A is false).
7. It didn't reduce jurisdiction (so C is false).
8. It didn't mandate two-judge for admissibility; it allowed single or three-judge (so B may be incorrect, but I'm not sure).
9. No requirement for unanimous decisions (so E is false).

But the options are from A to J, and the question is to pick one.

I think the most clearly false statement is G, because it's a significant right that wasn't eliminated. So G is false.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, the correct answer might be D, as it's about the term being shortened when it was extended.

Wait, the options are:

D: Protocol 14 shortened the judicial term of office for the European Court of Human Rights.

I: Protocol 14 extended the judicial term of office for the European Court of Human Rights.

I think I is correct, so D is false.

So among the options, both D and G are false, but the question expects one answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is G.

Wait, perhaps the answer is G. Because the right to individual petition remains, so G is false.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A, because the HRC was established by the UN, not Protocol 14.

The question is which statement is false.

So, which of the options is false.

The options are:

A: Protocol 14 established the Human Rights Council. (False, as it's the UN that did that.)

B: Mandated two-judge formation. (Maybe true or false; not sure.)

C: Reduced jurisdiction. (False, because it didn't reduce.)

D: Shortened term. (False, as it extended.)

E: Unanimous decisions. (False.)

F: Added new admissibility. (True.)

G: Eliminated individual petition. (False.)

H: Changed to one-judge. (True.)

I: Extended term. (True.)

J: Abolished Commission. (True.)

So, the false statements are A, C, D, E, G.

But the question is which one is false, so perhaps the intended answer is G.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D.

Wait, but in the options, both D and I are about term length. Since I is correct, D must be false.

So perhaps the answer is D.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about each option again.

Option G: Eliminated individual petition. No, the right remains. So G is false.

Option D: Shortened term. No, term was extended. So D is false.

So both D and G are false.

But the question asks which one is false. So perhaps I need to pick the most appropriate one.

Looking back at the options, perhaps the intended answer is G.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me try to recall.

The right to individual petition was maintained under Protocol 14. So G is definitely false.

So, the answer is G.

But wait, another possibility: Protocol 14 did not eliminate the right to individual petition. So option G is false.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D.

Wait, the terms were extended, so D is false.

But the question is to choose one. I think the correct answer is G, but I'm not 100% sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is A, as it's about the Human Rights Council, which is a different body.

Wait, the question is about which statement is false. So if A says Protocol 14 established HRC, which is false, then A is a false statement.

So the answer could be A or G or D.

But I think the intended answer is G because the right to individual petition is a key feature, and eliminating it would be a major change, which didn't happen.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D because it's about term lengths.

I think I need to make a decision. I'll go with option G as the false statement because it's a crucial right that wasn't removed.

To determine which statement is false, let's analyze each option based on the known effects of Protocol 14:

- **Option A**: "Protocol 14 established the Human Rights Council."  
  This is false. The Human Rights Council is a United Nations body established in 2006, unrelated to Protocol 14, which pertains to the European Court of Human Rights.

- **Option B**: "Protocol 14 mandated a two-judge formation for hearing admissibility cases."  
  This is uncertain but likely false. Protocol 14 introduced single-judge formations for certain admissibility cases, so mandating a two-judge formation seems incorrect.

- **Option C**: "Protocol 14 reduced the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights."  
  This is false. Protocol 14 aimed to streamline and enhance efficiency, not reduce jurisdiction.

- **Option D**: "Protocol 14 shortened the judicial term of office for the European Court of Human Rights."  
  This is false. Protocol 14 extended the judicial term of office from 6 to 9 years.

- **Option E**: "Protocol 14 introduced a requirement for unanimous decision-making in admissibility cases."  
  This is false. There is no such requirement; decisions can be made by a majority.

- **Option F**: "Protocol 14 added a new criterion for admissibility."  
  This is true. A new admissibility criterion was introduced, related to significant disadvantage.

- **Option G**: "Protocol 14 eliminated the right to individual petition."  
  This is false. The right to individual petition remains a cornerstone of the system.

- **Option H**: "Protocol 14 changed the committee that hears admissibility cases from a three-judge to a one-judge formation."  
  This is true. Single-judge formations were introduced for certain cases.

- **Option I**: "Protocol 14 extended the judicial term of office for the European Court of Human Rights."  
  This is true. Terms were extended from 6 to 9 years.

- **Option J**: "Protocol 14 abolished the Commission of Human Rights."  
  This is true. The Commission was abolished, making the Court the sole organ.

Among the false statements, the most significant and clear falsehood is **Option G**, as the right to individual petition was not eliminated. This right is fundamental to the European human rights system, and its elimination would have been a drastic change, which did not occur.

**Answer: G**
