Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Because of a sudden and unanticipated severe shortage of heating fuel, the President has ordered all offices of federal executive agencies to be open only four days per week. The President's order allows an exception to the extent that emergency circumstances require different hours of operation (as in the case of federal hospitals). When Congress enacted the appropriations statute for operating all federal executive agencies, its members assumed that the offices of those agencies would be open five days per week, but Congress did not include such a requirement in its appropriations statute or in any other statute. Is the President's order constitutional?

Options:

A: No, because the heads of the various executive agencies have final responsibility for the operation of those agencies' offices.
B: No, because when they passed the statute appropriating monies for the operation of executive agencies, members of Congress assumed that those agencies' offices would be open five days per week.
C: Yes, because the Constitution vests the President with plenary authority to direct the administration of all federal agencies in any manner the President deems expedient.
D: Yes, because the order relates to the management of the executive branch and is not prohibited by any statute.

Okay, so I've got this constitutional law question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me start by breaking down the problem.

The scenario is about the President ordering federal executive agencies to be open only four days a week because of a heating fuel shortage. There's an exception for emergencies, like hospitals. Now, Congress appropriated funds for these agencies assuming they'd operate five days a week, but they didn't include that requirement in any statute.

The question is whether the President's order is constitutional. The options are A to D, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, I remember that the President has certain powers as the head of the executive branch. Article II of the Constitution says the President must "take care that the laws are faithfully executed." Also, the Vesting Clause gives the President executive power. So, the President has authority over executive branch agencies.

But wait, Congress makes the laws, including appropriations. They give money for agencies to operate. However, just because they assumed a five-day week doesn't mean they legally required it. If the statute doesn't specify, the President might have discretion.

I think about the case where the President can direct how federal funds are used as long as it's within the appropriation. So if the appropriation is for operations, the President can decide how to manage those operations, like the number of days offices are open, especially if it's for a good reason like a fuel shortage.

Looking at the options:

A: No, because agency heads are responsible. But the President is the top of the executive branch; he can direct agencies. So A seems wrong.

B: No, because Congress assumed five days. But assumption isn't law. Congress didn't write it into the statute, so the President's order should be okay. So B is probably incorrect.

C: Yes, because the President has plenary authority. Plenary means complete. While the President does have a lot of authority, I'm not sure if it's absolute in this case. There might be limits, especially regarding appropriations. But since the order is about operations within the appropriation, it might still hold.

D: Yes, because it's about executive management and not prohibited by statute. This sounds right. The President is managing the executive branch, and as long as there's no law against it, he can do it. Since Congress didn't include the requirement, it's allowed.

So between C and D. Option C says the President has plenary authority to direct administration. That's a broad statement, but in reality, the President's authority isn't without limits. The Appropriations Clause gives Congress power over funding, but once appropriated, the President can manage the funds.

So the better answer is D because it's about management without violating any statute. The President's order doesn't conflict with any law; it's just using discretion in how to allocate resources (like being open fewer days to save fuel). Congress didn't prohibit this, so it's permissible.

Wait, but what if the statute had specific terms? Since it didn't, the President can adjust operations as needed. So yes, D makes sense.

The President's order is constitutional because it pertains to the management of the executive branch and is not explicitly prohibited by any statute. The President, as the head of the executive branch, has the authority to direct how federal agencies operate within the bounds of their appropriated funds. While Congress assumed a five-day workweek when appropriating funds, this assumption was not codified into law. Therefore, the President's decision to reduce operating days for efficiency or necessity, such as addressing a fuel shortage, falls within the scope of executive discretion. 

Options A and B are incorrect because the President, not individual agency heads, has ultimate authority over executive branch operations, and congressional assumptions without statutory backing do not limit presidential authority. Option C is too broad in asserting "plenary authority," as presidential power is not absolute and must respect legal boundaries. Option D correctly identifies that the President's order is permissible because it relates to executive management and does not violate any statute.

Answer: D
