Okay, so I've got this question here about psychological concepts, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about a friend who says, "Every time I plan a vacation, there's always a crisis at home or work so that I can't go." The assumption is that this isn't really true, so the friend's statement illustrates one of the given options.

The options are A through J, each a different bias or cognitive concept. I need to pick which one fits best.

First, I should understand what each option means. Let me go through them one by one.

A: Illusory correlation. That's when someone perceives a relationship between two events that isn't actually there. Like thinking that when you wear a certain shirt, you win, so you keep wearing it even though it's just coincidence.

B: Base rate fallacy. This is ignoring general statistical information in favor of specific, more vivid info. For example, thinking you're more likely to die in a plane crash than a car because plane crashes are more dramatic, even though cars are more dangerous.

C: Cognitive dissonance. This happens when someone holds two conflicting thoughts, causing discomfort, so they change one belief to reduce the discomfort. Like buying a product and then feeling bad if it's not as good as expected.

D: Anchoring bias. Relying too much on the first piece of information given when making decisions. For example, if you're told a house is priced at $500k and then see it's $450k, you might think it's a better deal than it is.

E: Availability heuristic. Judging the likelihood of an event based on how easily examples come to mind. Like thinking planes are unsafe because you remember recent crashes, even though they're rare.

F: Fundamental attribution bias. This is the tendency to overestimate the role of personality and underestimate situational factors in shaping behavior. For example, thinking someone failed a test because they're not smart, not because the test was hard.

G: Hindsight bias. Believing, after an event, that you would have predicted it. Like saying "I knew that would happen" even if you didn't.

H: Self-serving bias. Attributing your successes to your own abilities and blaming external factors for your failures. Like taking credit for a project's success but blaming the team when it fails.

I: Psychological reactance. This is when someone feels a negative emotion and is motivated to restore their freedom when they feel it's being threatened. For example, if someone tells you not to do something, you might do it just to assert your freedom.

J: Confirmation bias. Seeking information that confirms your existing beliefs and ignoring info that contradicts them. Like only reading news that supports your political views.

Now, the friend's statement: every time they plan a vacation, a crisis happens. But the question says it's not really true, so they're perceiving a pattern that doesn't exist.

Which concept fits this? They're seeing a correlation between planning a vacation and a crisis. But if it's not true, it's an illusion.

Illusory correlation (A) is when you think two things are related when they're not. So maybe that's it.

Alternatively, availability heuristic (E) is about judging likelihood based on how easily examples come to mind. If the friend has had a few instances where planning a vacation was followed by a crisis, maybe they overestimate how common this is because those instances are vivid.

Wait, but the question says it's not really true, so the friend is seeing a pattern that doesn't exist. So it's more about perceiving a relationship where none exists, which points to illusory correlation.

But wait, availability heuristic is about how readily examples come to mind, affecting perceived probability. So if the friend remembers the times a crisis happened when planning a vacation, they might overestimate how often it occurs, making them think it's a pattern.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn between A and E.

Let me think again. The friend is stating a cause-effect relationship: every time they plan a vacation, a crisis happens. If this isn't true, they're creating a false connection between planning and crises. That sounds like an illusory correlation.

But alternatively, maybe they're just remembering the instances where this happened and forgetting the times it didn't, which is availability heuristic. They might think it's more common because those instances are more memorable.

Wait, but the question says "every time," which is a strong statement. So it's a belief in a consistent pattern. So perhaps it's more about perceiving a correlation that isn't there, which is illusory correlation.

I think I'll go with A: illusory correlation.

Wait, but another thought: Confirmation bias is when you look for info that confirms your existing beliefs. If the friend already believes that planning vacations leads to crises, they might notice only the times it happens and ignore the times it doesn't. So that could be confirmation bias.

But the question is about the friend's statement illustrating the concept, assuming it's not true. So the friend is making a generalization that isn't based on reality. So it's about perceiving a pattern that's not there.

So, that's still between A and J. Hmm.

Wait, the friend's belief is that every time they plan a vacation, a crisis occurs. If this isn't the case, perhaps they are selectively remembering the times it did happen and forgetting the times it didn't. That selective memory is the availability heuristic, because the examples are more available in their mind.

So then, the friend overestimates the frequency because they can easily recall the instances when both happened. So it's availability heuristic.

Alternatively, illusory correlation is about perceiving a relationship between two variables that aren't actually correlated. So if the friend believes that planning a vacation causes a crisis, that's a correlation they think exists.

I think both could apply, but I'm trying to decide which is a better fit.

Another way: Availability heuristic is about overestimating the likelihood because the events are vivid. So the friend thinks it's common because they can remember the times it happened. But in reality, it's not that common.

Illusory correlation is about perceiving a relationship that doesn't exist. So the friend sees a cause-effect that isn't there.

In this case, the friend is asserting a pattern: every time they plan, a crisis occurs. So it's about a perceived correlation, which is illusory.

So I think the answer is A: illusory correlation.

The question involves a friend who claims, “Every time I plan a vacation, there's always a crisis at home or work so that I can't go,” and it is assumed that this statement is not true. The task is to determine which psychological concept best illustrates this scenario.

To analyze this, it is important to evaluate the options provided:

- **Illusory correlation (A):** This occurs when someone perceives a relationship between two events that does not actually exist. In this case, the friend believes there is a consistent pattern where planning a vacation leads to a crisis, even though this pattern is not real. This fits the scenario well because the friend is perceiving a causal relationship that is not supported by evidence.

- **Availability heuristic (E):** This involves judging the likelihood of an event based on how easily examples come to mind. If the friend vividly remembers instances where planning a vacation was followed by a crisis, they might overestimate how common this occurrence is. However, the friend’s statement emphasizes a perceived pattern rather than just overestimating the frequency of crises.

- **Confirmation bias (J):** This is the tendency to seek information that confirms one’s existing beliefs while ignoring contradictory evidence. While the friend might selectively focus on instances where crises occurred after planning a vacation, the primary issue here is the perception of a nonexistent pattern, which aligns more closely with illusory correlation.

Given the friend’s assertion of a consistent and causal relationship between planning a vacation and experiencing a crisis—a relationship that does not actually exist—the best explanation is **illusory correlation**. This concept directly addresses the perception of a pattern where none exists, making **A** the most appropriate answer.
