Okay, so I've got this chemistry question in front of me, and I need to figure it out. The question is about Lewis structures and bond lengths in different molecules. Let me think through this step by step.

The question asks which molecule has the shortest bonds among CO2, CO3^2-, NO2^-, and NO3^-. The options are A through J, each being a different molecule. My task is to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that bond length is related to bond order. The higher the bond order, the shorter the bond. So I need to find out the bond orders in each of these molecules.

Let me list the molecules again:
- CO2
- CO3^2-
- NO2^-
- NO3^-

I'll go through each one and determine their bond orders.

Starting with CO2. Carbon dioxide is a linear molecule. Each oxygen is double-bonded to carbon. So each O has a double bond, meaning a bond order of 2. CO2 has two double bonds, so each bond is a double bond.

Next, CO3^2-. The carbonate ion. Carbon is bonded to three oxygens. Two of them are single bonds, and one is a double bond, or maybe resonance structures where the double bond can be in any of the three positions. So each C-O bond has a bond order. Let me calculate that. The total valence electrons: Carbon has 4, each O has 6, and there's a charge of -2, so 4 + (3*6) + 2 = 24 electrons. The Lewis structure has one double bond and two single bonds. So the bond order for each C-O bond is (number of bonds)/number of bonds. Wait, no, bond order is the number of bonds. But since the double bond is delocalized, each bond has an order of 1.33 (because one double and two singles across three positions). So each bond is (4/3) on average? Wait, maybe I'm confusing this. Let me think again: in carbonate, each C-O bond is a resonance hybrid. So each bond is something like 1 and 1/3, so 4/3. So the bond order is about 1.33.

Now, NO2^-: The nitrite ion. Nitrogen has a double bond to one oxygen and a single bond to another. But wait, since there's a negative charge, maybe the bonding is different. Let's calculate the valence electrons. Nitrogen has 5, each O has 6, plus one for the negative charge: 5 + 2*6 +1 = 18. The Lewis structure would have one double bond and one single bond, with a lone pair on N. So the bond order for each N-O bond: one is double (order 2), the other is single (order 1). But because of resonance, the two bonds are equivalent. So each bond has an average order of (2 + 1)/2 = 1.5.

Wait, wait, no. Because in NO2^-, the structure has resonance between two forms: one where the double bond is on one O, single on the other, and vice versa. So each N-O bond is actually an average of single and double bonds. So each has a bond order of 1.5. So bond length would be shorter than a single bond but longer than a double bond.

Then, NO3^-: The nitrate ion. It has a central nitrogen bonded to three oxygens. Each bond is a combination of single and double bonds due to resonance. Let me calculate the electrons. Nitrogen has 5, each oxygen 6, and the charge is -1, so 5 + 3*6 +1 = 24 electrons. The Lewis structure has one double bond and two single bonds, but resonance allows delocalization. So each N-O bond has a bond order of (1 double bond + 2 single bonds)/3 positions? No, wait, in nitrate, each N-O bond is a resonance hybrid of one double and two single bonds. So each bond has a bond order of (1.5) because each equivalent bond has (2 + 1 + 1)/3? No, wait, no. Let me think again: the nitrate ion has three equivalent N-O bonds. The total number of bonds is 1.5 per bond. Because there are three bonds total, with 3*(bond order) = sum of bonds. The actual bonding is one double bond and two single bonds in different resonance structures. So each bond is on average 1.33. Or another approach: the total bonding electrons would be 4 (from N) plus 3* (each O has 6, but in the molecule, each O contributes one electron to the bonding). Wait, perhaps the bond order is (number of bonds) per bond. For nitrate, each N-O bond is 1.33 on average.

Wait, let me check that. For CO3^2- and NO3^-, both have similar structures. The CO3^2- has each C-O bond at about 1.33, and NO3^- has each N-O bond at about 1.33 as well. But wait, in NO2^-, each N-O bond is 1.5, which is higher than 1.33.

Wait, but wait, I thought the bond order in NO2^- is 1.5. So that's higher than in CO3^2- (1.33). So the higher the bond order, the shorter the bond.

So comparing all four molecules:

CO2: bond order 2 (double bond)
CO3^2-: bond order ~1.33
NO2^-: bond order ~1.5
NO3^-: bond order ~1.33

So CO2 has the highest bond order (2), so the bonds are the shortest. So the molecule with the shortest bonds is CO2.

But wait, the options are:

The options are A through J, but the molecules in the question are CO2, CO3^2-, NO2^-, NO3^-, and the options are A: O2, B: NO3, etc. So looking back at the options, the correct answer must be the molecule with the highest bond order, which is CO2.

Looking at the options, the question gives options as A to J, and the answer options are various molecules. The question is, which of the given options is the correct answer.

Wait, the question is, the four molecules are CO2, CO3^2-, NO2^-, and NO3^-. We're to choose the one among these four with the shortest bonds.

So the correct answer is CO2, which has double bonds (bond order 2), which is higher than the others, so its bonds are the shortest.

Looking at the options, which option corresponds to CO2?

Looking at the options:

Options are:

A: O2

B: NO3

C: NO2^-

D: CO3^2-

E: NO2

F: CO

G: NO

H: CO2

I: CO3

J: NO3^-

So option H is CO2.

Therefore, the answer is H.

To determine which molecule has the shortest bonds, we analyze the bond orders in the given molecules: CO2, CO3^2-, NO2^-, and NO3^-. Bond length is inversely related to bond order, so the molecule with the highest bond order will have the shortest bonds.

1. **CO2**: Carbon dioxide is a linear molecule with two double bonds between carbon and oxygen. Each bond has a bond order of 2, which is the highest among the molecules.

2. **CO3^2-**: The carbonate ion has one double bond and two single bonds between carbon and oxygen. Due to resonance, the bond order is delocalized, and each C-O bond has an average bond order of approximately 1.33.

3. **NO2^-**: The nitrite ion has one double bond and one single bond between nitrogen and oxygen. Due to resonance, the two N-O bonds are equivalent, with an average bond order of 1.5.

4. **NO3^-**: The nitrate ion has one double bond and two single bonds between nitrogen and oxygen. Due to resonance, the bond order is delocalized, and each N-O bond has an average bond order of approximately 1.33.

Comparing the bond orders:
- CO2: Bond order = 2
- CO3^2-: Bond order ≈ 1.33
- NO2^-: Bond order ≈ 1.5
- NO3^-: Bond order ≈ 1.33

CO2 has the highest bond order (2), so its bonds are the shortest. Among the given options, CO2 corresponds to option H.

Answer: H
