Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about electric flux and charge. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but let's try to think it through. 

The question says the electric flux through a spherical surface is 4.0e4 N·m²/C. I need to find the net charge enclosed by the surface. The options are given from A to J, all in the order of 1e-7 or similar. 

Wait, I remember something about Gauss's Law. Oh right, Gauss's Law relates electric flux to the charge enclosed. The formula is Φ = Q_enc / ε₀, right? So Φ is the electric flux, Q_enc is the charge enclosed, and ε₀ is the vacuum permittivity. 

Oh wait, wait. I think the exact formula is Φ = Q_enclosed divided by ε₀. So to find Q, I rearrange the formula: Q = Φ * ε₀. 

What's the value of ε₀? I think it's approximately 8.85e-12 C²/(N·m²). Yeah, that's right. 

So plugging in the numbers: Φ is 4.0e4 N·m²/C. Multiply that by 8.85e-12 C²/(N·m²). Let's do the calculation step by step. 

First, 4.0e4 is the same as 4 * 10^4. Multiply that by 8.85e-12. So 4 * 8.85 is... 35.4. Then the exponents: 10^4 * 10^-12 = 10^-8. So 35.4e-8, which is the same as 3.54e-7 C. 

Looking at the options, option I is 3.54e-07, which matches. So the answer should be I. 

Wait, but let me double-check. Did I get the formula right? Another thought: sometimes flux equations can be confusing. Oh wait, no—Gauss's Law says Φ = Q_enclosed / ε₀, so Q is Φ * ε₀. Yep, that's correct. 

And the calculation: 4e4 * 8.85e-12. 4 * 8.85 is 35.4, and 1e4 *1e-12 is 1e-8. So 35.4e-8 is indeed 3.54e-7. 

So I think I'm confident the answer is I.

To determine the net charge enclosed by the spherical surface, we use Gauss's Law, which states:

\[
\Phi = \frac{Q_{\text{enclosed}}}{\epsilon_0}
\]

Rearranging for \( Q_{\text{enclosed}} \), we get:

\[
Q_{\text{enclosed}} = \Phi \cdot \epsilon_0
\]

Here, the electric flux \( \Phi \) is given as \( 4.0 \times 10^4 \, \text{N·m}^2/\text{C} \), and the vacuum permittivity \( \epsilon_0 \) is approximately \( 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{C}^2/(\text{N·m}^2) \). Substituting these values:

\[
Q_{\text{enclosed}} = (4.0 \times 10^4) \cdot (8.85 \times 10^{-12})
\]

First, calculate the product of the coefficients:

\[
4.0 \cdot 8.85 = 35.4
\]

Next, add the exponents:

\[
10^4 \cdot 10^{-12} = 10^{-8}
\]

Thus:

\[
Q_{\text{enclosed}} = 35.4 \times 10^{-8} = 3.54 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{C}
\]

Comparing this result with the provided options, the correct answer is:

**I: 3.54e-07**

Answer: I
