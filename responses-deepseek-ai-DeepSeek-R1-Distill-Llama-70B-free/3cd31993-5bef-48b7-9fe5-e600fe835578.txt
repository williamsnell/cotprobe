Question:

This question refers to the following information.
Yi Yin sacrificed to the former king, and presented the heir-king reverently before the shrine of his grandfather. . . . Yi Yin then clearly described the virtue of the Meritorious Ancestor for the instruction of the young king.
"Oh! of old the former kings of Xia cultivated earnestly their virtue, and then there were no calamities from Heaven. The spirits of the hills and rivers were all in tranquility; and the birds and beasts enjoyed their existence according to their nature. But their descendant did not follow their example, and Heaven sent down calamities, using our ruler, who possessed of its favor. The attack on Xia may be traced to the orgies in Ming Tiao. . . . Our king of Shang brilliantly displayed his sagely prowess; for oppression he substituted his generous gentleness. Now your Majesty is entering on the inheritance of his virtue; all depends on how you commence your reign.
"Oh! the former king began with careful attention to the bonds that hold men together. . . . Revere these warnings in your person. . . . The ways of Heaven are not invariable: on the good-doer it sends down all blessings, and on the evil-doer it sends down all miseries. If you not be virtuous, be it in large things or in small, it will bring the ruin of your ancestral temple."

Okay, so I've got this question here about a passage from the Shu Jing, which is an ancient Chinese text. The question is asking what the phrase tells us about the ruler. The options are from A to J, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I should read the passage carefully. It's about Yi Yin sacrificing to the former king and presenting the heir-king before the shrine. Then Yi Yin talks about the virtue of the Meritorious Ancestor, instructing the young king.

The passage mentions that the former kings of Xia cultivated their virtue, so there were no calamities. Then their descendant didn't follow, leading Heaven to send down calamities, using their ruler who had Heaven's favor. The attack on Xia is traced to orgies in Ming Tiao. The king of Shang displayed sagely prowess, substituting oppression with gentle generosity. The young king is inheriting his virtue, and the start of his reign is crucial.

Yi Yin warns that Heaven's ways aren't invariable. It blesses the good and punishes the evil. If the ruler isn't virtuous, whether in big or small things, it'll ruin the ancestral temple.

So, the question is about what the phrase tells us about the ruler. Let's look at the options.

Option A says he was a weak leader. The passage doesn't mention weakness, just whether he's virtuous or not. So maybe not A.

Option B says he was killed by natural disasters. The passage talks about Heaven sending calamities, but it's not clear if the ruler was killed. It's more about the consequences of his actions.

Option C says he was an absolute monarch. The passage doesn't specify the type of governance system, just the virtue and Heaven's response. So probably not C.

Option D says he wasn't of noble birth. There's no info about his background, so D is unlikely.

Option E says he was a benevolent ruler. The passage does talk about substituting oppression with generosity, which sounds benevolent. But wait, the context is about the king of Shang, not necessarily the current ruler. The current ruler is being advised, so the passage is more about the previous king's virtue and the current one needing to follow.

Option F says he was a tyrant. The passage mentions that the king of Shang stopped oppression, implying the previous ruler might have been a tyrant, but the current ruler is being advised to be virtuous. So perhaps the previous ruler was a tyrant, but the current one's status isn't clear yet.

Option G says he disregarded his ancestors' teachings. The passage is actually advising him to follow the teachings, so it's more about the advice given rather than what he did. So G might not be correct.

Option H says he lost the blessing of the gods. The passage mentions that if he isn't virtuous, Heaven will send miseries. But it's a warning, not stating that he already lost it. Unless the context is that the previous ruler lost it, leading to the attack on Xia. So maybe the previous king lost the blessing, but the current one is being warned.

Option I says he was exiled. There's no mention of exile in the passage.

Option J says he had the Mandate of Heaven. The Mandate of Heaven is a concept where the ruler is divinely appointed. The passage talks about Heaven sending calamities and the ruler having Heaven's favor. So when the ruler is virtuous, he has the Mandate, and when not, he loses it. The current ruler is inheriting the virtue, implying he has the Mandate.

Wait, but the passage says the attack on Xia was because the descendant didn't follow virtue, and Heaven used their ruler. So the ruler of Xia lost the Mandate, leading to the attack. The Shang king then took over, having the Mandate. So the current ruler (the young king) is starting his reign, and the passage is advising him to maintain virtue to keep the Mandate.

So the phrase tells us that the ruler (the young king) has the Mandate of Heaven, which is option J. Alternatively, the passage could be implying that the ruler must maintain the Mandate, so the correct answer is J.

The passage from the Shu Jing emphasizes the importance of virtue for rulers and the concept of the Mandate of Heaven. It explains that when a ruler is virtuous, Heaven blesses him, but when he is not, Heaven withdraws its favor, leading to calamities. The king of Shang is noted for substituting oppression with generosity, highlighting his virtuous reign. The young king is being advised to follow this example, as the start of his reign will determine whether he retains Heaven's favor.

The phrase suggests that the ruler's position is contingent upon his virtue and that he must maintain it to keep the Mandate of Heaven. This aligns with option J, which states that the ruler had the Mandate of Heaven.

Answer: J
