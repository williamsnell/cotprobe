Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the orbital angular momentum quantum number of an electron in aluminum when it's ionized. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

First, I remember that the orbital angular momentum quantum number is denoted by l. Each value of l corresponds to a specific type of orbital: s, p, d, f, etc. The s orbitals have l=0, p is l=1, d is l=2, and so on. So the question is asking what's the l value of the electron that's most easily removed when aluminum is ionized.

Wait, when a metal is ionized, it loses its valence electrons, right? And the most easily removed electrons are the valence electrons because they're the outermost ones. So I need to find out which orbital the valence electrons of aluminum are in and then determine the l value for that orbital.

Aluminum has an atomic number of 13. Let me write out its electron configuration to be sure. The ground-state electron configuration for aluminum is [Ne] 3s² 3p¹. Okay, so the valence electrons are in the 3s and 3p orbitals. But wait, when metals ionize, they typically lose electrons starting from the outermost shell. So the 3p orbital is higher in energy than 3s, so the 3p electron would be the first to go.

Wait, no, wait. Actually, the 3s electrons are lower in energy than the 3p, but when it comes to ionization, I think the 3p is the valence orbital here. Because in the third shell, the order is 3s, then 3p. So the 3p electrons are the ones being removed when aluminum ionizes. So the electron in question is in the p orbital.

So what's the l value for a p orbital? Oh right, p has l=1. So the orbital angular momentum quantum number l is 1.

Wait, but wait another thing. Aluminum has 13 electrons. Its electron configuration is 1s² 2s² 2p⁶ 3s² 3p¹. So the outermost electrons are in the 3s and 3p. But when ionizing, aluminum loses the 3p electron first because it's in a higher energy level. So the electron being removed is from the p orbital, which has l=1.

So the correct answer should be H: 1.

Wait, but let me double-check. Sometimes, when writing electron configurations, the 4s comes before 3d, but that's not relevant here. Oh wait, aluminum is in the third period, so 3s and 3p are filled. So yes, the valence electron is the 3p, which is l=1.

The orbital angular momentum quantum number, \( l \), corresponds to the type of orbital an electron occupies. For aluminum, the ground-state electron configuration is \( 1s^2 2s^2 2p^6 3s^2 3p^1 \). When aluminum is ionized, it loses its valence electron, which is the electron in the 3p orbital. The \( l \) value for a p orbital is 1. Therefore, the orbital angular momentum quantum number of the electron most easily removed is \( l = 1 \).

Answer: H
