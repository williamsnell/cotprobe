Okay, so I've got this question about partnerships, and I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, but I'll try to work through it. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, Pete Smith and Bill Jones are partners in a general partnership called "Pete Smith Plumbing." Pete is the active partner, which means he's handling the day-to-day business, while Bill is a silent partner, not involved in management. After six years of not being involved, Bill buys 100 toilets for the business. Pete is upset because they probably won't use all those toilets for years and wants advice.

The question is about what the best advice is for Pete. The options are from A to J. I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I should recall the rules about general partnerships. In a general partnership, all partners have the authority to bind the partnership in business matters. This is because each partner is considered an agent of the partnership. So, any partner can enter into contracts on behalf of the partnership, and the partnership is legally bound by those actions, even if other partners disagree.

But wait, there's something about silent partners. Silent partners typically don't participate in the management. However, their status as a partner still means they have the authority to act on behalf of the partnership, unless there's an agreement that limits their authority.

So, if Bill, as a silent partner, buys the toilets, does that bind the partnership? I think it does because, under the law, any partner can bind the partnership. The fact that Bill is silent doesn't change that unless they had a specific agreement limiting his authority.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The partnership can only be bound by the actions of the active partner, not the silent partner. Hmm, I don't think that's right because, generally, any partner can bind the partnership.

Option B: Silent partners are investors only and cannot bind the partnership. That seems incorrect because, as I remember, silent partners are still partners and can bind the partnership unless restricted by agreement.

Option C: Bill can bind the partnership by his act. This aligns with what I was thinking. Since Bill is a partner, even a silent one, his actions can bind the partnership.

Option D: Bill's action is invalid because he didn't consult Pete. No, because the requirement isn't consultation; it's about authority. If Bill has authority, consultation isn't necessary.

Option E: The partnership can return the toilets because Bill didn't have authority. If Bill had authority, then E is wrong.

Option F: Unless his name is in the partnership name, third persons are on notice he's unauthorized. I don't think the name in the partnership affects third-party liability. Third parties can assume any partner has authority unless they know otherwise.

Option G: Pete can sue Bill for unnecessary expenditure. Partners can sometimes sue each other for breach of fiduciary duty if they act beyond their authority. But wait, Bill's action was within his authority as a partner, so maybe Pete can't sue him for that. Unless the purchase was beyond the scope of the business, but buying toilets for a plumbing business seems within scope.

Option H: Bill, as a silent partner, isn't authorized to purchase, so the sale may be set aside. No, because as a partner, he is authorized unless the partnership agreement says otherwise.

Option I: The third party can be held liable for not verifying authority. No, because third parties can rely on a partner's apparent authority. They don't need to verify unless they have reason to doubt.

Option J: If Bill used his personal funds, the partnership isn't bound. No, because using personal funds doesn't negate the partnership's liability if the purchase was for partnership purposes.

So, the correct answer should be option C. Bill, as a silent partner, can bind the partnership by his actions because partners have that authority unless restricted by agreement. Since the question doesn't mention any such agreement, we assume he had the authority.

Wait, but I thought sometimes silent partners might have limited authority? Or is that only in limited partnerships? Oh right, in a general partnership, all partners are general partners with full authority. Limited partners, on the other hand, can't bind the partnership. But Bill is a silent partner in a general partnership, so he's still a general partner.

So yes, the correct answer should be C.

The question revolves around the authority of a silent partner in a general partnership. In a general partnership, all partners, including silent partners, have the authority to bind the partnership unless restricted by a specific agreement. Bill, as a silent partner, is still a general partner and thus has the authority to act on behalf of the partnership. The purchase of 100 toilets, being within the scope of the plumbing business, falls under his authority. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, D, E, F, H, I, J**: These options incorrectly suggest that silent partners lack authority to bind the partnership or that Bill's actions are invalid. However, under general partnership law, silent partners retain the authority to act on behalf of the partnership unless explicitly restricted.
- **G**: While partners can sometimes sue each other for breach of fiduciary duty, Bill's purchase of toilets for the business does not constitute unauthorized or reckless behavior, as it is within the scope of the partnership's activities.
- **C**: This is correct because Bill, as a silent partner in a general partnership, has the authority to bind the partnership through his actions, such as purchasing the toilets.

Thus, the best advice is that Bill's action binds the partnership.

Answer: C
