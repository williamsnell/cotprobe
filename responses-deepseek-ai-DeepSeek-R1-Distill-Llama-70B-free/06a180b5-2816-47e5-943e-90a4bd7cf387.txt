Okay, so I've got this problem about a two-period binomial model for stock prices, and I need to find the current price of an American put option. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, let me jot down the given data. The current stock price is $70.00, and it's a non-dividend-paying stock. The up factor u is 1.181, which means if the stock goes up, it multiplies by u. The down factor d is 0.890, so if it goes down, it multiplies by d. Each period is 6 months, making the option one year, since there are two periods.

The strike price is $80.00, and the risk-free rate is 5% continuously compounded. Oh wait, so the rate is 5% per year, right? Since each period is half a year, I'll need to adjust the rate for each period.

I remember that in the binomial model, we calculate the option price by discounting the expected payoff at expiration. But since this is an American option, I have to consider the possibility of early exercise, which complicates things a bit. Oh wait, but in the binomial model, especially for puts, sometimes it's optimal to exercise early if the option is deep in the money. So I can't just calculate the final payoffs and discount; I need to check at each node if exercising early gives a better value.

The formula for the option price involves risk-neutral probabilities. The risk-neutral probability of an up move, p, is calculated using (e^(rΔt) - d)/(u - d), where Δt is the time per period. Since each period is 6 months, Δt is 0.5 years.

Let me compute p. The risk-free rate r is 5%, so rΔt is 0.05 * 0.5 = 0.025. e^0.025 is approximately 1.0253. Then, (1.0253 - d)/(u - d) = (1.0253 - 0.890)/(1.181 - 0.890). Let me calculate that denominator and numerator.

Denominator: 1.181 - 0.890 = 0.291. Numerator: 1.0253 - 0.890 = 0.1353. So p = 0.1353 / 0.291 ≈ 0.465. That's the risk-neutral probability of the up move. The down probability is 1 - p ≈ 0.535.

Now, I need to build the binomial tree for two periods. Each period, the stock can go up or down. So after two periods, there are four possible paths: uu, ud, du, dd. Let me calculate the stock prices at each node.

Starting with $70:
- After first period up: 70 * 1.181 = 82.67
   - Then up again: 82.67 * 1.181 ≈ let's see, 82.67 * 1.181. Let me compute 80 *1.181=94.88, 2.67*1.181≈3.16, so total ~98.04. Wait no, wait, no, wait, 82.67 * 1.181. Let me compute 82 *1.181. 80*1.181 is 94.88, 2*1.181 is 2.362, so 97.242. Then 0.67*1.181 is about 0.791. So total is 97.242 + 0.791 ≈ 98.033.

- After first period up, then down: 82.67 * 0.890. Let's calculate that. 80 *0.89=71.2, 2.67*0.89≈2.38. So total ≈73.58.

Then, starting with first period down: 70 * 0.890 = 62.3.

- Then up: 62.3 *1.181. Let me compute 60*1.181=70.86, 2.3 *1.181≈2.72, so total ≈73.58.

- Then down: 62.3 *0.890. 60*0.89=53.4, 2.3*0.89≈2.047, total ≈55.447.

Wait, so the four possible end prices after two periods are approximately:

- UU: ~98.03

- UD or DU: ~73.58

- DD: ~55.45

Wait, but wait, the order doesn't matter because multiplication is commutative, so UD and DU give the same price.

Now, the put option has a strike of $80. So the payoff at expiration is max(80 - S, 0). Let's compute the payoffs for each of the four end nodes.

- For UU: 98.03. 80-98.03 is negative, so payoff is 0.

- For UD or DU: 73.58. 80-73.58=6.42. So payoff is $6.42.

- For DD: 55.45. 80-55.45=24.55. So payoff is $24.55.

Now, to calculate the put option price, I need to discount these payoffs back to the present, but considering the risk-neutral probabilities. However, since it's an American option, I have to check at each intermediate node whether it's optimal to exercise the option early.

Wait, the binomial model has nodes at each period. So after the first period, the stock can be either up (82.67) or down (62.3). At each of these points, I should check if the put option's value is higher when exercised immediately or when holding on.

So let's approach this step by step. We can model this using a tree, starting from the end.

First, let's compute the put option's value at each node in the second period (the end of year 1, which is the expiration for a one-year option). As we've done, the payoffs are 0, 6.42, 6.42, 24.55.

But wait, the tree after two periods is at year 1, so each path is two periods. Wait, no, the option is one year, so each period is 6 months, so two periods make one year. So the final payoffs are at year 1.

Wait, perhaps I should model this as a two-period tree, with each node having put option values. So the option can be exercised at year 0.5 or year 1. So the steps are:

1. Start at time 0.

2. Period 1 (6 months): stock goes up to 82.67 or down to 62.3.

3. Period 2 (another 6 months): each of those leads to their own next nodes, as we've calculated.

So to find the put price, I need to work backward through the tree, calculating the put value at each node, considering whether to exercise early.

Let me outline the nodes:

Time 0:

- Stock price S0 = $70.

Time 1 (after 6 months):

- S_up = 70 * u = 82.67

- S_down = 70 * d = 62.3

Time 2 (1 year):

- From S_up:

   - S_uu = 82.67 * u ≈98.03

   - S_ud =82.67 * d ≈73.58

- From S_down:

   - S_du =62.3 * u ≈73.58

   - S_dd =62.3 * d ≈55.45

So the put option's value at each Time 2 node is max(80 - S, 0), which we have as 0, 6.42, 6.42, 24.55.

Now, moving back to Time 1 nodes, S_up and S_down.

At each Time 1 node, we can calculate the put option's value as the maximum between:

a) Exercising immediately: max(80 - S, 0)

b) Holding the option and taking the discounted expected value of the next period's put prices.

So for each Time 1 node, compute both and take the max.

Let's start with the Time 1 node S_up =82.67.

At this node, the intrinsic value (exercise now) is max(80 -82.67, 0) = 0. So if we hold, we need to calculate the expected value of the put option in the next period.

The possible next prices from S_up are S_uu (98.03) and S_ud (73.58). Their put values are 0 and 6.42, respectively.

The expected value using risk-neutral probabilities is p*(0) + (1-p)*(6.42) = 0.465 * 0 + 0.535 *6.42 ≈ 3.43.

Then discount this expected value back by the risk-free rate for one period (since we're going back from Time 2 to Time 1). The discount factor is e^(-rΔt) = e^(-0.05*0.5) = e^(-0.025) ≈ 0.9753.

So the present value is 3.43 * 0.9753 ≈ 3.35.

Since the intrinsic value is 0, and the present value of continuing is 3.35, the put option value at S_up is max(0, 3.35) = 3.35.

Now, moving to the Time 1 node S_down =62.3.

The intrinsic value here is max(80 -62.3,0) =17.7.

Now, calculate the expected value of holding. From S_down, next period leads to S_du (73.58, put value 6.42) and S_dd (55.45, put value 24.55).

The expected value is p*(6.42) + (1-p)*(24.55) = 0.465 *6.42 + 0.535 *24.55.

Compute each part: 0.465 *6.42 ≈ 2.98, 0.535 *24.55≈13.12. Sum is 2.98 +13.12≈16.10.

Discount this by the same factor: 16.10 *0.9753 ≈15.70.

So the value of holding is 15.70. Comparing to intrinsic value 17.7, the option holder would choose to exercise early because 17.7 >15.70. So the put value at S_down is 17.7.

Now, moving back to Time 0.

The put option's value at Time 0 is the maximum between exercising now and the expected discounted value of the put in the next period.

Intrinsic value at Time 0: max(80 -70,0)=10.

But we need to calculate the expected value of the option in the next period, which is the put values at Time 1 nodes.

At Time 1, the put values are 3.35 (from S_up) and 17.7 (from S_down).

So the expected value is p*(3.35) + (1-p)*(17.7).

Compute this: 0.465 *3.35 ≈1.557, 0.535 *17.7 ≈9.4745. Sum ≈11.0315.

Discount this back one period: 11.0315 *0.9753 ≈10.75.

Now, compare this to the intrinsic value of 10. Since 10.75 >10, the option holder would choose not to exercise now but to hold. So the put option's value at Time 0 is 10.75.

Wait, but looking at the answer options, option I is 10.75. So that's the answer.

Hmm, but wait let me double-check my calculations because sometimes it's easy to make a mistake with the numbers.

Wait, let me recalculate Time 1's S_down expected value.

At S_down (62.3), the next period's put values are 6.42 (S_du) and 24.55 (S_dd). The probability of up is p=0.465.

So expected value before discounting: 0.465 *6.42 = let's compute 0.465 *6 =2.79, 0.465 *0.42≈0.1953 → total ≈2.9853.

For the down part: 0.535 *24.55 = 0.5 *24.55=12.275, 0.035*24.55≈0.859 → total ≈13.134.

So sum is 2.9853 +13.134 ≈16.1193. Then discount by 0.9753: 16.1193 *0.9753≈15.72.

So the holding value is 15.72, which is less than the intrinsic value of 17.7, so we exercise early, so the put value at S_down is 17.7.

At Time 0, the expected value is p*3.35 + (1-p)*17.7.

p=0.465, so 0.465*3.35= approx 1.557, 0.535*17.7=9.4745. Sum ≈11.0315.

Discount by 0.9753: 11.0315 *0.9753 ≈10.75.

So yes, the value is 10.75, which is option I.

To determine the current price of a one-year American put option on a nondividend-paying stock with a strike price of $80.00, we use a two-period binomial model. The given parameters are:

- Current stock price: $70.00  
- Up factor: \( u = 1.181 \)  
- Down factor: \( d = 0.890 \)  
- Risk-free rate: \( r = 5\% \) (continuously compounded)  
- Time per period: \( \Delta t = 0.5 \) years  

### Step 1: Calculate risk-neutral probabilities
The risk-neutral probability of an up move is given by:  
\[
p = \frac{e^{r \Delta t} - d}{u - d}
\]  
Substituting \( r = 0.05 \), \( \Delta t = 0.5 \), \( u = 1.181 \), and \( d = 0.890 \):  
\[
p = \frac{e^{0.025} - 0.890}{1.181 - 0.890} \approx \frac{1.0253 - 0.890}{0.291} \approx 0.465
\]  
The risk-neutral probability of a down move is:  
\[
1 - p \approx 0.535
\]

### Step 2: Build the stock price tree
Starting with the initial stock price \( S_0 = 70 \), we calculate the stock prices at each node:  

- After one period:  
  - Up: \( S_u = 70 \times 1.181 = 82.67 \)  
  - Down: \( S_d = 70 \times 0.890 = 62.3 \)  

- After two periods:  
  - From \( S_u = 82.67 \):  
    - Up: \( S_{uu} = 82.67 \times 1.181 \approx 98.03 \)  
    - Down: \( S_{ud} = 82.67 \times 0.890 \approx 73.58 \)  
  - From \( S_d = 62.3 \):  
    - Up: \( S_{du} = 62.3 \times 1.181 \approx 73.58 \)  
    - Down: \( S_{dd} = 62.3 \times 0.890 \approx 55.45 \)  

Thus, the possible stock prices after two periods are:  
- \( S_{uu} \approx 98.03 \)  
- \( S_{ud} \approx 73.58 \)  
- \( S_{du} \approx 73.58 \)  
- \( S_{dd} \approx 55.45 \)  

### Step 3: Calculate put option payoffs at expiration
The payoff of the put option at expiration is \( \max(80 - S, 0) \):  
- At \( S_{uu} = 98.03 \): \( \max(80 - 98.03, 0) = 0 \)  
- At \( S_{ud} = 73.58 \): \( \max(80 - 73.58, 0) = 6.42 \)  
- At \( S_{du} = 73.58 \): \( \max(80 - 73.58, 0) = 6.42 \)  
- At \( S_{dd} = 55.45 \): \( \max(80 - 55.45, 0) = 24.55 \)  

### Step 4: Calculate put option values at intermediate nodes
Using backward induction, we calculate the put option values at each node by discounting the expected payoffs or comparing them to the intrinsic value (early exercise).  

#### At \( S_u = 82.67 \) (first period, up):  
- Intrinsic value: \( \max(80 - 82.67, 0) = 0 \)  
- Expected value of holding:  
\[
p \times 0 + (1 - p) \times 6.42 = 0.465 \times 0 + 0.535 \times 6.42 \approx 3.43
\]  
- Discounted value:  
\[
3.43 \times e^{-r \Delta t} = 3.43 \times 0.9753 \approx 3.35
\]  
- Since \( 3.35 > 0 \), the put option value at \( S_u = 82.67 \) is \( 3.35 \).  

#### At \( S_d = 62.3 \) (first period, down):  
- Intrinsic value: \( \max(80 - 62.3, 0) = 17.7 \)  
- Expected value of holding:  
\[
p \times 6.42 + (1 - p) \times 24.55 = 0.465 \times 6.42 + 0.535 \times 24.55 \approx 16.10
\]  
- Discounted value:  
\[
16.10 \times e^{-r \Delta t} = 16.10 \times 0.9753 \approx 15.70
\]  
- Since \(
