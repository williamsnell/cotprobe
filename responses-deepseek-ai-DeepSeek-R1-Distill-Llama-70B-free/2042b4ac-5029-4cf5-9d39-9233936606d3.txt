Question:

A resort computes its guest fees on the basis of the duration of the visit (D) , plus the amount of time spent in the steam-massage room. Tom spends 4 days at the resort and 10 hours in the steam-massage room. In a 7 day stay, Jane spends 30 hours with masseurs. Their bills are $500. and $1,125, respectively. The cost of a visit (C) is given by the following linear equation: C =xD+yH. Find the values of the constants x and y.

Options:

A: x = $100, y = $15
B: x = $75, y = $20

E: x = $125, y = $5
F: x = $50, y = $25
G: x = $85, y = $10

Okay, so I've got this problem here about a resort that charges guests based on the duration of their visit and the time they spend in the steam-massage room. The equation given is C = xD + yH, where C is the cost, D is the days, and H is the hours in the steam-massage room. I need to find the constants x and y.

Hmm, the problem gives me two scenarios. First, Tom spends 4 days and 10 hours, and his bill is $500. Then Jane stays for 7 days and spends 30 hours, and her bill is $1,125. So I can set up two equations based on these.

Wait, let's write that down. For Tom: C is 500, D is 4, H is 10. So equation one is 500 = 4x + 10y. For Jane: C is 1125, D is 7, H is 30. So equation two is 1125 = 7x + 30y.

Now I have a system of two equations:

1) 4x + 10y = 500
2) 7x + 30y = 1125

I need to solve for x and y. I think I can use either substitution or elimination. Maybe elimination is easier here.

Let me try to make the coefficients of one of the variables the same. Let's see, maybe eliminate y first. To do that, find a common multiple for the coefficients. Equation 1 has 10y and equation 2 has 30y. The least common multiple is 30. So I'll multiply equation 1 by 3 to get 30y.

So equation 1 multiplied by 3 becomes: 12x + 30y = 1500.

Now, subtract equation 2 from this new equation:

(12x + 30y) - (7x + 30y) = 1500 - 1125
12x -7x +30y-30y = 375
5x = 375
So x = 375 /5 = 75.

Wait, x is 75. Hmm, okay. Now plug x back into one of the original equations to find y. Let's use equation 1: 4x +10y =500.

Plugging x=75: 4*(75) = 300. So 300 +10y =500. Subtract 300: 10y=200. So y=200/10=20.

So x is 75, y is 20. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option B is x=75, y=20. So the answer should be B.

Wait, let me double-check with Jane's data. Using x=75 and y=20, Jane's cost is 7*75 +30*20.

7*75 is 525. 30*20 is 600. 525+600=1125. Which matches her bill. So yes, that's correct.

To solve for the constants \( x \) and \( y \) in the cost equation \( C = xD + yH \), we use the given data:

1. **Tom's bill**: \( C = 500 \), \( D = 4 \), \( H = 10 \).  
   Equation: \( 500 = 4x + 10y \).

2. **Jane's bill**: \( C = 1125 \), \( D = 7 \), \( H = 30 \).  
   Equation: \( 1125 = 7x + 30y \).

### Step 1: Set up the system of equations
\[
\begin{cases}
4x + 10y = 500 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
7x + 30y = 1125 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\end{cases}
\]

### Step 2: Eliminate one variable
To eliminate \( y \), multiply Equation 1 by 3:
\[
12x + 30y = 1500 \quad \text{(Equation 3)}
\]
Subtract Equation 2 from Equation 3:
\[
(12x + 30y) - (7x + 30y) = 1500 - 1125
\]
\[
5x = 375 \implies x = 75
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( y \)
Substitute \( x = 75 \) into Equation 1:
\[
4(75) + 10y = 500
\]
\[
300 + 10y = 500 \implies 10y = 200 \implies y = 20
\]

### Step 4: Verify the solution
Using \( x = 75 \) and \( y = 20 \), verify Jane's bill:
\[
C = 7x + 30y = 7(75) + 30(20) = 525 + 600 = 1125
\]
The calculations are correct.

### Final Answer
The constants are \( x = 75 \) and \( y = 20 \), which corresponds to **Option B**.
