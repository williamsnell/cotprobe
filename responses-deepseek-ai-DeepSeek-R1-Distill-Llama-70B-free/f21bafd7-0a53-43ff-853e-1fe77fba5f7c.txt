Question:

A professor was the record owner in fee simple absolute of a 30-acre tract of land located in a small town. The professor made a conveyance thereof in these words, "I hereby convey my 30-acre tract to both my friend and my co-worker as joint tenants with right of survivorship. "Two years after making the conveyance to the friend and the co-worker, the friend executed a mortgage on the 30-acre tract of land to a bank to secure a loan. One year after executing the mortgage, the friend died intestate, leaving his uncle as his only heir. At the time of the friend's death, the indebtedness had not been paid to the bank. The jurisdiction in which the 30-acre tract of land is located recognizes a title theory of mortgages. In an appropriate action, the court should determine that title to the 30-acre tract of land is vested

Options:

A: in the bank until the mortgage is paid, then in the co-worker and the uncle.
B: half in the co-worker and half in the bank, with both subject to the mortgage.
C: entirely in the uncle, subject to the mortgage.
D: entirely in the uncle, free and clear of the mortgage.
E: half in the co-worker and half in the uncle, with both subject to the mortgage.
F: in the co-worker and the uncle, with the co-worker's portion free of the mortgage and the uncle's portion subject to it.
G: half in the co-worker, free of the mortgage, and half in the uncle, subject to the mortgage.
H: in the co-worker, with the entire interest subject to the mortgage.
I: half in the co-worker, subject to the mortgage, and half in the uncle, free of the mortgage.

Okay, so I've got this property law question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question is about.

So, the setup is that a professor owns a 30-acre tract in fee simple absolute. He conveys it to his friend and co-worker as joint tenants with right of survivorship. Two years later, the friend mortgages the property to a bank for a loan. Then, a year after that, the friend dies intestate, leaving an uncle as his only heir. The debt hasn't been paid yet. The jurisdiction follows the title theory of mortgages, and we need to determine who owns the property now.

Hmm. I remember joint tenancy with right of survivorship means that when one joint tenant dies, their interest automatically goes to the surviving tenant(s), right? So the friend's death should mean the co-worker gets the entire interest, but wait, there's a mortgage involved. So what happens with the mortgage?

Wait, but in a title theory state, the mortgage actually conveys legal title to the mortgagee (the bank) until the loan is repaid. So when the friend mortgaged the property, did he have the right to do that? Because as a joint tenant, he only owns an undivided half-interest, so maybe he could only mortgage his own share.

But wait, when a joint tenant mortgages their interest, what happens? I think in a title theory state, the mortgage would transfer the legal title of the mortgaging tenant's interest to the bank. So the bank would hold a mortgage on the friend's share. But when the friend dies, under joint tenancy, the co-worker would get the entire property, but what about the mortgage on the friend's half?

Wait, no. Because in joint tenancy, each has the right of survivorship. So when the friend dies, the co-worker gets the whole thing. But wait, if the friend had mortgaged his interest, does that affect the co-worker's interest?

Wait, but the mortgage was created by the friend before he died. So the mortgage would encumber the friend's interest. But upon the friend's death, his interest would pass to the co-worker by survivorship. So the bank's mortgage is only on the friend's interest, which is now extinguished because the co-worker has taken the entire title.

Wait, but how does that work exactly? Because in title theory states, the mortgagee (bank) holds legal title. So when the friend mortgages his interest, the bank gets legal title to that interest. But since the friend dies, and in joint tenancy, the co-worker takes the entire title, does the bank's interest get extinguished?

Alternatively, perhaps the mortgage only affected the friend's interest, but upon his death, that interest ceases to exist, so the mortgage can't attach to the co-worker's interest because the co-worker now owns the entire property. Wait, but the bank's mortgage would still be on the property, but only as it relates to the friend's share, which is now gone.

Alternatively, maybe the mortgage would still encumber the entire property because the friend didn't have the authority to mortgage the co-worker's share. So the bank's mortgage is only on the friend's half. When the friend dies, that half is extinguished, and the co-worker's half is not encumbered. But does the mortgage survive the friend's death? Or does the mortgage only apply to the friend's interest, which is now gone.

Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. In title theory states, the mortgage conveys legal title to the bank. So if the friend mortgages his interest, the bank gets title to that interest. But the friend's interest in joint tenancy is subject to the right of survivorship. So when the friend dies, the co-worker takes the entire estate. But does the bank's interest in the friend's share get wiped out because the friend's interest ended?

Wait, perhaps the bank only had a mortgage on the friend's share, which upon his death, that share is extinguished. Therefore, the bank's mortgage is only on the friend's interest, which is now gone, so the co-worker's interest is free and clear.

Alternatively, maybe the mortgage is on the entire property because the friend, as a joint tenant, could only mortgage his own interest, not the whole. So the co-worker's interest remains unaffected. So when the friend dies, the co-worker gets the entire property, but the bank's mortgage is only on the friend's half, which is gone, so the co-worker owns it all, free of the mortgage.

Wait, but mortgages can sometimes affect the entire property even if only one tenant mortgages their interest. Or does that depend on the type of tenancy?

No, I think in joint tenancy, each tenant's interest is undivided, so a mortgage by one only affects their own interest. So when the friend dies, the co-worker's interest absorbs the friend's, but the bank's mortgage is only on the friend's share, which is now part of the co-worker's ownership. So the bank's mortgage would encumber the entire property, because the friend's share is now part of the co-worker's interest.

Wait, no, I'm getting more confused. Let me try a different approach. Let's break it down step by step.

1. The professor conveys the property to Friend and Co-worker as joint tenants with right of survivorship. So each owns an undivided 50% interest, but they are not tenants in common. So neither can unilaterally sever the joint tenancy except by certain actions (like mortgaging?).

2. Friend executes a mortgage on the 30-acre tract to the bank. So in a title theory state, the bank gets legal title to the mortgaged interest. So the Friend's interest is mortgaged, meaning the bank holds title to Friend's share until the loan is repaid.

3. Friend dies intestate. Under joint tenancy, the Co-worker gets the entire property by survivorship. But what about the mortgage?

In a title theory state, when Friend dies, his interest ends, so the bank's mortgage was on that interest. But upon Friend's death, the Co-worker owns the entire property. So does the mortgage survive in any way?

Alternatively, perhaps the mortgage only applies to Friend's share, which is now gone. So the Co-worker's interest is free and clear, because the mortgage was only on Friend's interest, which has been extinguished.

Wait, but in a title theory state, the mortgage is a conveyance of legal title. So when Friend mortgages his interest, the bank gets title to that interest. But when Friend dies, that interest ceases to exist because the Co-worker takes it through survivorship. So the bank's title to Friend's interest is now gone because Friend's interest is gone. So the Co-worker owns the entire property, and the bank's mortgage is no longer valid because the interest they held (Friend's) no longer exists.

Wait, but that can't be right because mortgages usually survive death. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the bank's mortgage is on the entire property because when Friend mortgages his interest, it's considered to encumber the whole property. But no, because in joint tenancy, each has an undivided interest, so the mortgage would only be on the Friend's interest.

Wait, but perhaps when Friend dies, the Co-worker's interest absorbs the Friend's, so the mortgage would now affect the Co-worker's entire interest. But that doesn't make sense because the Co-worker wasn't a party to the mortgage.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think about the options.

The options are:

A: in the bank until the mortgage is paid, then in the co-worker and the uncle.

B: half in the co-worker and half in the bank, both subject to mortgage.

C: entirely in the uncle, subject to mortgage.

D: entirely in uncle, free and clear.

E: half co, half uncle, both subject.

F: co and uncle, co's part free, uncle's subject.

G: co's half free, uncle's half subject.

H: co-worker, entire subject.

I: co's half subject, uncle's free.

Wait, the friend died, so the uncle is the heir, but in joint tenancy, the co-worker gets it all, right? So the uncle shouldn't get anything because joint tenancy takes precedence over intestate succession.

Wait, no, if the friend and co-worker are joint tenants, then when the friend dies, the co-worker gets the entire property, and the friend's interest doesn't go to his estate or heirs. So the uncle wouldn't inherit anything.

Wait, but wait: the friend executed a mortgage before dying. So before the friend's death, he mortgaged his interest. Then he dies, so the co-worker gets his interest via survivorship. But the mortgage was on the friend's interest, so the bank's mortgage is on the friend's share, which is now part of the co-worker's ownership. So the bank's mortgage would now encumber the co-worker's entire interest because the co-worker now owns the whole property, including what was the friend's share.

Wait, but how does that work? Because the co-worker wasn't a party to the mortgage. So can the bank enforce the mortgage against the co-worker?

Alternatively, perhaps the mortgage only applies to the friend's interest, which upon his death, is absorbed into the co-worker's interest, so the bank's mortgage now applies to the entire property because the friend's interest is now part of the co-worker's.

Wait, but that might not be the case. Let me think again: in a title theory state, the bank holds legal title to the mortgaged interest. So when the friend dies, his interest (with the bank holding title) passes to the co-worker. So the co-worker now holds the entire title, but the bank's mortgage is on the friend's share, which is now part of the co-worker's ownership. So the bank can enforce against the entire property because the friend's interest is part of the co-worker's now.

Wait, no, that can't be right because the co-worker's interest was separate. Alternatively, maybe the bank's mortgage only applies to the friend's share, which is now gone, so the co-worker's interest is free.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should consider whether the friend's mortgage affected the entire property or just his own interest.

In joint tenancy, each tenant can mortgage their own interest without affecting the other's. So the friend's mortgage would only encumber his own interest, not the co-worker's. So when the friend dies, the co-worker takes the entire property, but the friend's interest was mortgaged. Wait, but the mortgage was on the friend's interest, which is now gone. So the co-worker's interest is unaffected.

Wait, but in title theory, the bank holds title to the friend's interest. When the friend dies, the co-worker takes the friend's interest, but the bank still holds the mortgage on that interest. So the co-worker would have to satisfy the mortgage to get the title free and clear.

Alternatively, since the friend's interest has been extinguished, the bank's mortgage is now on an interest that no longer exists. So the co-worker owns the entire property, and the bank's mortgage is no longer valid because the friend's interest is gone.

Wait, but that seems incorrect because the bank's interest in the property shouldn't just vanish. Maybe in title theory, the bank's mortgage is on the specific interest, so when that interest is extinguished, the mortgage is as well. But that doesn't seem right because the bank should have a claim on the property.

Alternatively, perhaps the mortgage survives and the co-worker now owns the entire property subject to the mortgage. But the co-worker wasn't a party to the mortgage, so the bank can't enforce against the co-worker's interest.

Wait, but in title theory, the bank has legal title. So when the friend dies, the co-worker gets the beneficial interest in the entire property, but the bank still holds legal title to the friend's share, which is now part of the co-worker's interest. So the co-worker would have to redeem the mortgage to get full title.

So the title would be with the co-worker, subject to the mortgage held by the bank. So the co-worker owns the property, but the bank can foreclose if the loan isn't repaid.

So looking at the options, option H says "in the co-worker, with the entire interest subject to the mortgage." That seems to fit.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

Option H: in the co-worker, with the entire interest subject to the mortgage.

Yes, that sounds correct. Because the friend's interest was mortgaged, and upon his death, the co-worker takes the entire property, but the mortgage encumbers the whole because the friend's share is now part of the co-worker's ownership. So the bank can enforce the mortgage against the entire property.

Alternatively, in title theory, the bank only has a lien on the friend's share, but upon the friend's death, that share is extinguished, so the bank's lien is only on that share. But since the co-worker now owns the entire property, the bank's lien would only be on the portion that was the friend's, which is now part of the co-worker's interest. So the entire property is subject to the mortgage.

Wait, I think that's how it works. So the correct answer would be H: entirely in the co-worker, subject to the mortgage.

But wait, another angle: when the friend mortgages his interest, he can't bind the co-worker. So the co-worker's interest remains free, but the friend's interest is subject to the mortgage. Upon the friend's death, the co-worker gets the friend's interest, but that interest is subject to the mortgage. So the co-worker would own the entire property, but the friend's share is subject to the mortgage, so the entire property is subject to the mortgage.

Yes, that makes sense. So the bank can enforce against the entire property because the friend's interest is now part of the co-worker's ownership. Therefore, the co-worker holds the entire title, but the property is still subject to the mortgage.

So the correct answer is H.
</think>

The professor conveyed the 30-acre tract to the friend and co-worker as joint tenants with right of survivorship. In a joint tenancy, each tenant holds an undivided 50% interest, and the right of survivorship ensures that the entire property passes to the surviving tenant upon the death of the other. 

Two years after the conveyance, the friend executed a mortgage on the property to secure a loan from the bank. In a title theory jurisdiction, a mortgage conveys legal title to the mortgagee (the bank) until the loan is repaid. Here, the friend only had the authority to mortgage their own undivided 50% interest in the property. Therefore, the bank's mortgage encumbered only the friend's interest, not the co-worker's.

When the friend died intestate, the co-worker inherited the entire property by operation of the right of survivorship. The friend's interest, which was subject to the mortgage, was extinguished and merged into the co-worker's interest. As a result, the entire property is now owned by the co-worker. However, the bank's mortgage, which encumbered the friend's interest, remains valid and now affects the entire property because the friend's interest is no longer separate and is part of the co-worker's ownership.

The co-worker now holds title to the entire property, but the property remains subject to the mortgage. The bank retains the right to enforce the mortgage against the entire property if the loan is not repaid. The uncle, as the friend's heir, has no claim to the property because joint tenancy takes precedence over intestate succession.

Among the options provided, the correct answer is:

**H: in the co-worker, with the entire interest subject to the mortgage.**

H
