Okay, so I've got this question about the GDP Deflator and the CPI. I remember that both are measures of inflation, but they're calculated differently. Let me think through this.

The question is asking how the GDP Deflator differs from the CPI. The options are A to J, and I need to pick the right one.

First, what do I know about the GDP Deflator? I think it's a broader measure because it includes all goods and services produced within the economy, not just consumer goods. Oh right, the CPI is based on a basket of goods and services that a typical consumer buys. So the GDP Deflator includes things like capital goods, which consumers don't buy. So that might relate to option A, which says the GDP Deflator excludes goods not bought by consumers. Wait no, the opposite. The GDP Deflator includes more than just consumer goods, so the CPI excludes those other goods. So maybe option A is incorrect because the GDP Deflator doesn't exclude those items.

Next, how are they calculated? The GDP Deflator is calculated using the formula: (Nominal GDP / Real GDP) * 100. So to get real GDP, they use base year prices. Wait, no, real GDP is calculated using base year prices, and nominal is current prices. So the deflator is comparing the two.

The CPI, on the other hand, is based on a fixed basket from the base year. So each year, they see how much that basket costs with current prices. So the CPI uses base year quantities because the basket doesn't change in terms of items and their quantities. The GDP Deflator, however, uses current year quantities because real GDP is based on current year production, but valued at base year prices.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The GDP Deflator uses current year prices and base year quantities? Or the other way around? Or maybe I'm mixing this up.

Wait, Real GDP is calculated as (Nominal GDP) / (GDP Deflator). Nominal GDP is current prices and quantities. Real GDP uses base year prices and current year quantities. So when calculating the GDP Deflator, the formula is (Nominal GDP / Real GDP) * 100. So Nominal GDP has current prices and current quantities, while Real GDP has base prices and current quantities. So the deflator is based on current prices, using the current quantities as weights.

In contrast, the CPI uses a fixed basket (base year quantities) and compares the cost at current prices to base year prices. So the CPI's basket doesn't change in quantity over time; it's fixed from the base year.

So the key difference is that the GDP Deflator uses current quantities (current year) while the CPI uses base year quantities. Looking back at the options, which one reflects that?

Option D says the GDP Deflator only incorporates base year quantities. No, wait, I think it's the opposite. Because the deflator uses current quantities. So option D is incorrect.

Wait, let me look at the options again:

Option B: incorporates current year quantities.

Option D: only incorporates base year quantities.

Wait, so which one is correct? The GDP Deflator uses current year quantities because it's based on current production. The CPI uses base year quantities because the basket is fixed.

So the GDP Deflator differs in that it uses current quantities, while the CPI uses base year quantities. So the correct answer would be that the GDP Deflator incorporates current year quantities.

Looking at the options, option B says "incorporates current year quantities in its calculations." So that's the difference. So the correct answer is B.

Wait, but let me think about another approach. The GDP Deflator is a Paasche index, while the CPI is a Laspeyres index. A Paasche index uses current quantities, and a Laspeyres uses base year quantities. So the GDP Deflator being a Paasche index uses current year quantities, which is option B.

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer is B.
</think>

The GDP Deflator differs from the CPI in that the GDP Deflator incorporates current year quantities in its calculations. This is because the GDP Deflator is a Paasche index, which uses current year quantities to measure inflation, whereas the CPI is a Laspeyres index, relying on base year quantities. This distinction highlights that the GDP Deflator reflects the current production structure of the economy, making it a broader and more dynamic measure of inflation compared to the CPI.

Answer: B
