Question:

Define Piaget's preoperational stage of cognitive development. Name and describe its twosubstages. The Conceptual Period of Intelligence Stage 1. Preoperational (2 - 7 yrs.) a.Preconceptual (18 mos. - 4 yrs.) First such use of representational thought and symbols, such as words, for objects; classification of objects. b. Intuitive thought (4 - 7 yrs.) Beginning of reasoning, but thinking is fragmented, centered on parts of things, rigid, and based wholly on appearances. 2. Concrete operations (7 - 11 yrs.) Can perform mental operations and reverse them. Can add up "all the marbles." Operations are however confined to concrete and tangible objects that are immediately present. 3. Formal operations (12 - 15 yrs.) Can form hypotheses, can go beyond operations appearances to deal with the truth or falsity of propositions.

Options:

A: The preoperational stage includes the intuitive thought substage from ages 2 to 4 and the formal operations substage from ages 4 to 7.
B: The preoperational stage consists of a single phase of development that spans from ages 2 to 7, without distinct substages.
C: The preoperational stage includes the preconceptual substage from ages 7 to 11 and the intuitive thought substage from ages 11 to 15.
D: The preoperational stage is characterized by abstract thinking and hypothetical reasoning from ages 4 to 7.
E: The preoperational stage is from birth to 2 years.
F: The preoperational stage consists of two substages: The preconceptual which lasts from ages 2 to 4 and the intuitive thought which extends from ages 4 to 7.
G: The preoperational stage consists of three substages: The preconceptual, concrete operations, and formal operations.
H: The preoperational stage involves logical thinking and reasoning.
I: The preoperational stage consists of two substages: The sensorimotor stage which lasts from birth to age 2, and the concrete operational stage which begins at age 2.
J: The preoperational stage consists of two substages: The symbolic function substage from ages 2 to 4 and the operational thought substage from ages 4 to 7.

Okay, so I have this question about Piaget's stages of cognitive development, specifically the preoperational stage. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

From what I remember, Jean Piaget proposed that children go through different stages as they develop cognitively. The stages are sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational. Each has its own characteristics and age ranges.

The question is asking about the preoperational stage and its two substages. I think the preoperational stage is the second one, right? So it comes after the sensorimotor stage, which is from birth to about 2 years. Preoperational is from around 2 to 7 years old.

Wait, the question says the preoperational stage is stage 1, but that doesn't sound right. Oh wait, looking back, maybe I misread. The provided information says "Conceptual Period of Intelligence Stage 1. Preoperational (2 - 7 yrs.)" So maybe in their outline, it's considered stage 1? Or perhaps it's a typo, and it's actually the second stage. Hmm, but the main point is about the substages.

So the substages are a and b. Substage a is called preconceptual, from 18 months to 4 years. It's the first use of symbols like words for objects and classifying objects. Then substage b is intuitive thought from 4 to 7 years. Here, the child starts reasoning but in a fragmented way, focusing on parts, rigid, and based on appearances.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: Preoperational includes intuitive (2-4) and formal operations (4-7). No, formal operations are a later stage, around 12-15. So A is wrong.

Option B: Says it's a single phase without substages. But the question says there are two, so B is incorrect.

Option C: Substages are from 7-11 and 11-15. Those are concrete and formal stages, not preoperational. So C is wrong.

Option D: Talks about abstract thinking from 4-7. But preoperational is more about symbols and intuitive, not abstract. Abstract is formal operations. So D is wrong.

Option E: Preoperational is from birth to 2. No, that's sensorimotor. E is wrong.

Option F: Two substages: preconceptual (2-4) and intuitive (4-7). Wait, but according to the info, preconceptual is 18 mos (1.5 yrs) to 4, and intuitive is 4-7. So F's substage a starts at 2, which is a bit later. So maybe F isn't exact. Or perhaps it's considering 2 as the start of preoperational, so the substage a starts within that.

Option G: Three substages including concrete and formal. No, preoperational only has two, so G is wrong.

Option H: Logical thinking. Preoperational is before concrete operations, which is when logical thinking starts. So H is wrong.

Option I: Mentions sensorimotor and concrete. Those are different stages, so I is incorrect.

Option J: Substages called symbolic function (2-4) and operational thought (4-7). Symbolic function sounds similar to preconceptual, but the second substage is operational, which might be confusing because concrete operations come later. So I'm not sure.

Wait, the correct substages are preconceptual and intuitive. So looking for an option that describes these two, with the correct age ranges.

Option F says preconceptual from 2-4 and intuitive 4-7. But the provided info says preconceptual is 18 mos to 4, which is 1.5 to 4, so maybe F starts a bit late. However, the preoperational stage itself is 2-7, so within that, the preconceptual would be 2-4, and intuitive 4-7. So F's age ranges fit within the stage.

So the correct answer should be F.

The preoperational stage, as described by Piaget, spans from ages 2 to 7 and is divided into two substages. The first substage, the preconceptual phase, occurs from approximately 18 months to 4 years and is characterized by the emergence of representational thought and the use of symbols, such as language, as well as basic classification of objects. The second substage, intuitive thought, lasts from 4 to 7 years and involves the beginning of reasoning, though this reasoning is fragmented, rigid, and based on appearances rather than logic.

Analyzing the options provided:

- **Option A** incorrectly associates the formal operations stage with the preoperational stage.
- **Option B** denies the existence of substages, which contradicts the question's structure.
- **Option C** misattributes the age ranges to later stages (concrete and formal operations).
- **Option D** incorrectly describes the preoperational stage as involving abstract thinking, which belongs to the formal operations stage.
- **Option E** incorrectly assigns the sensorimotor stage's age range to the preoperational stage.
- **Option F** correctly identifies the two substages (preconceptual and intuitive thought) and aligns their age ranges appropriately within the preoperational stage.
- **Option G** incorrectly includes three substages, which is inconsistent with the preoperational stage's structure.
- **Option H** incorrectly attributes logical thinking to the preoperational stage, which belongs to the concrete operations stage.
- **Option I** conflates the sensorimotor and concrete operational stages with the preoperational stage.
- **Option J** uses incorrect terminology for the substages, referring to "symbolic function" and "operational thought," which do not align with Piaget's terminology.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option F**, as it accurately describes the preoperational stage and its two substages with the appropriate age ranges.
