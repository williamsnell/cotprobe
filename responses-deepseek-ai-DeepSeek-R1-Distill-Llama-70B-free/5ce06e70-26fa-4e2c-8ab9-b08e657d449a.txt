Okay, so I have this question about which tradition promotes "gradual enlightenment." Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my religious traditions, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that in Buddhism, there are different schools with varying approaches to enlightenment. I think Zen Buddhism is a big one here. There are two main branches: Soto Zen and Rinzai Zen. From what I recall, Soto Zen emphasizes a more gradual approach. They focus on sitting meditation, or zazen, and the idea that enlightenment comes through consistent practice over time. It's like a slow, continuous process.

On the other hand, Rinzai Zen is more about sudden enlightenment. They use koans to provoke a sudden insight or awakening. So if the question is about gradual, Soto Zen would be the one.

Looking at the options, A is Soto Zen and C is Rinzai Zen. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but I should make sure there aren't other traditions that also promote gradual enlightenment. Let me think about the others. Kegon Buddhism, option B, I'm not too familiar with, but I think it's related to the Avatamsaka Sutra and more about the interconnectedness of all phenomena. Not sure about their stance on enlightenment speed.

Nichiren, option D, I believe is more about chanting the Lotus Sutra and achieving enlightenment in this life, but I don't remember if it's gradual or sudden. Probably more sudden, as it's focused on devotion and faith.

Jodo Shinshu, option F, is Pure Land Buddhism. They focus on being reborn in the Pure Land through faith in Amida Buddha. I think their approach is more about relying on Amida's grace, which might be seen as a quicker path rather than a gradual one.

Pure Land Buddhism, option H, is similar to Jodo Shinshu, I think. So same reasoning applies.

Confucianism, E, is more about ethics and societal harmony, not really focused on enlightenment in the Buddhist sense. Shinto, I, is the indigenous religion of Japan, focusing on spirits and rituals, again not about enlightenment.

Bushido, G, is the code of the samurai, more about conduct and honor, not enlightenment. Taoism, J, is Chinese and focuses on the Tao and living in harmony with nature. They do have practices that could lead to enlightenment, but I'm not sure if it's specifically gradual. I think Taoist practices can vary, but maybe they have a more gradual approach. However, the question is about which tradition is known for it, and I believe Soto Zen is the more direct answer.

So yeah, I think the answer is A: Soto Zen.

The tradition known to promote "gradual enlightenment" is Soto Zen. This school of Zen Buddhism emphasizes a slow, continuous process of enlightenment through consistent practice, particularly zazen (sitting meditation). Unlike Rinzai Zen, which focuses on sudden enlightenment via koans, Soto Zen aligns with the gradual approach. Other options like Kegon Buddhism, Nichiren, Jodo Shinshu, and Pure Land Buddhism focus on different methods or sudden enlightenment. Confucianism, Shinto, Bushido, and Taoism are unrelated or less directly associated with this concept. 

Answer: A
