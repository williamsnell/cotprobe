Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about Max Weber's four ideal types of social action. The question gives me the first three types and is asking for the fourth one. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that Max Weber was a sociologist who talked a lot about social actions and how people behave in society. He categorized these actions into different types based on their motivations and orientations. The question mentions three types already: instrumentally-rational, value-rational, and traditional. So I need to recall what the fourth one is.

Instrumentally-rational action, if I remember correctly, is when people act based on practical considerations and efficiency. They choose the best means to achieve a specific end. It's like when you decide which route to take to work based on which is faster.

Value-rational action is when the action is driven by a person's values or beliefs. They do something because it aligns with what they think is right, regardless of the outcome. For example, someone might choose a career they love even if it doesn't pay well because it fulfills them personally.

Traditional action is based on custom or tradition. People do things because that's how they've always been done, like following family traditions or cultural practices without questioning why.

Now, the fourth type. I think it's related to emotions or personal feelings. Weber talked about affect as a motivation. So the term might include "affectual." I've heard the term affectual action before in the context of Weber's work. That would mean actions are driven by emotions or sentiments rather than rationality or tradition.

Looking at the options provided:

A: normatively-rational – I'm not sure about this one. Normative usually relates to norms or rules, but I don't think that's the fourth type.

B: traditionally-rational – No, traditional is already one of the given types, so this might be a trick option.

C: practically-rational – That sounds a bit like instrumentally-rational, which is already listed.

D: effective – Doesn't ring a bell as one of Weber's types.

E: intuitively-rational – Not sure, but I don't recall this term being associated with Weber's four types.

F: affectively-rational – Hmm, affectively relates to emotions, but I'm not certain if Weber used this exact term.

G: infected – That doesn't make sense in this context.

H: emotionally-rational – Similar to F, but again, not sure of the exact term.

I: affectual – Yes, this seems right. I remember Weber using "affectual" to describe actions based on emotions.

So, putting it all together, the four types are instrumentally-rational, value-rational, traditional, and affectual. Therefore, the correct answer should be option I.

The four ideal types of social action identified by Max Weber are instrumentally-rational, value-rational, traditional, and affectual. The fourth type, affectual, refers to actions driven by emotions or personal feelings.
