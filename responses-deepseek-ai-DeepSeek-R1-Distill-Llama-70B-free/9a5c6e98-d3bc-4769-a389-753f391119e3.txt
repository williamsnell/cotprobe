Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about logical fallacies, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read it carefully.

The question is asking which fallacy involves suppressing evidence by eliminating a source from consideration because it's claimed to be flawed. But the key point is that there's no real connection between the supposed flaw and the source's reliability.

Hmm. I remember that logical fallacies are errors in reasoning that can undermine the logic of an argument. There are quite a few of them, so I need to think through each option.

The options are A through J. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: Straw man. That's when someone misrepresents someone else's argument to make it easier to attack. Like, creating a weaker version of the argument. Doesn't seem to fit here because the question is about discrediting a source, not misrepresenting an argument.

Option B: Snob appeal. I think this is when someone tries to influence others by appealing to their desire to be part of a group perceived as sophisticated or of higher status. Like, "only intelligent people buy this product." Not related to discrediting evidence sources.

Option C: Bandwagon fallacy. That's when someone argues that because many people believe something, it must be true. Like, "everyone's doing it, so you should too." Again, not about attacking the credibility of a source based on a flaw.

Option D: Appeal to anonymous authority. This is when someone cites an unnamed authority to support their claim. For example, "experts say..." without naming them. This might relate to credibility, but it's more about the authority not being named rather than attacking their credibility based on an unrelated flaw.

Option E: False dilemma. This presents only two options as if they are the only possibilities when there are more. Like, "you're either with us or against us." Doesn't fit the question.

Option F: Significance. I'm not sure about this one. Maybe it's the appeal to significance, where someone makes a claim implying a connection where none exists. Not sure, but I don't think this is the one we're looking for.

Option G: Appeal to ignorance. This is arguing that because something isn't known to be false, it must be true, or vice versa. For example, "no one has proven it's not true, so it must be true." Not about discrediting a source.

Option H: Argumentum ad populum. That's the same as the bandwagon fallacy, appealing to popular opinion. So, same as option C.

Option I: Poisoning the well. Oh, wait! I think this is when someone tries to discredit a source by bringing up some unrelated issue to make people not consider their arguments. Like, saying a researcher has a certain political view that's unpopular, so their research must be flawed, even though the research is sound. This seems to fit the question because it's about eliminating a source based on an alleged flaw that isn't actually related to their credibility.

Option J: Cherry picking. That's when someone selects only favorable evidence and ignores the rest. It's about selectively presenting information, not discrediting the source itself.

So, putting it all together. The question is about a fallacy where a source is discredited based on an unrelated flaw, thus suppressing evidence. That sounds like poisoning the well. So the correct answer should be I.

The fallacy described in the question involves discrediting a source based on an unrelated flaw to suppress evidence. This matches the definition of "poisoning the well," where an opponent is discredited by introducing irrelevant negative information. 

Answer: I
