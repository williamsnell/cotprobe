Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. 

The question is about an automobile emitting CO gas. It says the car is traveling at 10 miles per hour and produces 0.33 pounds of CO gas per mile. The question is asking how many moles of CO are produced per mile. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm. I remember that to convert between mass and moles, I need to use molar mass. Oh right, the molar mass is the mass of one mole of a substance. For CO, which is carbon monoxide, the molar mass should be the sum of carbon and oxygen's atomic masses.

Carbon has an atomic mass of about 12.01 g/mol, and oxygen is around 16.00 g/mol. So adding them together, 12.01 + 16.00 equals 28.01 g/mol. So the molar mass of CO is 28.01 grams per mole.

Wait, but the problem gives the mass of CO in pounds. I need to convert pounds to grams because molar mass is in grams. I remember that 1 pound is approximately 453.592 grams. Let me make sure, yeah, 1 lb = 453.59237 grams. I'll just use 453.6 for simplicity.

So 0.33 pounds per mile. To convert that to grams, I multiply 0.33 lb by 453.6 g/lb. Let me do that calculation. 0.33 * 453.6 equals... let me compute that. 

0.33 * 450 is 148.5, and 0.33 * 3.6 is about 1.188. So adding those together, 148.5 + 1.188 is approximately 149.688 grams. So 0.33 pounds is about 149.688 grams.

Wait, wait, maybe I should do it more accurately. Let's calculate 0.33 * 453.6.

0.33 * 400 = 132.
0.33 * 50 = 16.5.
0.33 * 3.6 = 1.188.
Adding those: 132 + 16.5 = 148.5, plus 1.188 gives 149.688 grams. Yep, that's right.

Now, I have 149.688 grams of CO per mile. To find moles, I divide by the molar mass. So moles = mass / molar mass.

Molar mass of CO is 28.01 g/mol. So moles = 149.688 g / 28.01 g/mol.

Let me compute that. Let's see, 28 times 5 is 140. 28.01 * 5 = 140.05. So 5 moles would be 140.05 grams. But I have 149.688 grams, which is a bit more than 5 times. 

Wait, maybe I should do it more precisely. Let's calculate 149.688 divided by 28.01.

I can approximate 28.01 as about 28. Let me compute 149.688 / 28. 

28 goes into 149 how many times? 28 * 5 is 140, so 5 times, remainder 9. 28 * 5.3 is 148.4 (since 0.3*28=8.4). So 5.3 times would be 148.4. Subtract that from 149.688, which leaves 1.288. Then 1.288 divided by 28 is about 0.046. So adding that, 5.3 + 0.046 is approximately 5.346 moles. 

Wait, but perhaps I should use a calculator approach. Let me do it step by step.

28.01 * 5 = 140.05. Subtract that from 149.688: 149.688 -140.05 =9.638.

Now, 28.01 goes into 9.638 how many times? 9.638 /28.01 ≈ 0.344 times. So total moles would be 5 + 0.344 = 5.344 moles per mile. 

Wait, that's about 5.34 moles. Let me check the options. Looking at the options:

A:5.4, B:9.0, C:2.5, D:7.3, E:3.8, F:4.8, G:4.1, H:5.9, I:8.1, J:6.2.

Hmm, option A is 5.4, which is close to my calculation of 5.34. But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the pound to gram conversion. Let me double-check that part.

Wait, 0.33 pounds multiplied by 453.592 grams per pound. Let me calculate that exactly. 

0.33 * 453.592 = ?

Let me calculate 0.3 * 453.592 = 136.0776.

0.03 *453.592 = 13.60776.

Adding them together: 136.0776 + 13.60776 = 149.68536 grams. So that's accurate, about 149.685 grams.

Now, 149.685 grams divided by 28.01 g/mol.

Let me do this division more accurately.

28.01 * 5 =140.05 → subtract from 149.685 → 9.635.

So, 9.635 /28.01. Let's compute 28.01 * 0.34 = ?

28 *0.34 = 9.52. 0.01 *0.34=0.0034. So 9.52 +0.0034=9.5234. So 28.01 *0.34 =9.5234. 

So 9.635 is a bit more than 0.34 times. The difference is 9.635 -9.5234 =0.1116.

So how much more? 0.1116 /28.01 ≈0.00398.

So total moles =5 +0.34 +0.00398≈5.34398, approximately 5.344 moles per mile.

Looking at the options, option A is 5.4, which is very close. But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere.

Wait, let me try another approach. Maybe I can calculate it as (0.33 lb/mile) * (453.592 g/lb) / (28.01 g/mol).

So 0.33 *453.592 = 149.68536 grams.

Then 149.68536 /28.01 = ?

Let me compute 28.01 * 5 =140.05.

Subtract 140.05 from 149.68536 → 9.63536.

Now, 9.63536 divided by 28.01 → let me compute 28.01 * x =9.63536 → x=9.63536/28.01.

Compute 9.63536 ÷28.01.

Well, 28.01 *0.344 = 9.632 (since 28*0.344=9.632; 0.01*0.344=0.00344. So 9.632+0.00344=9.63544). Oh wait, that's very close to 9.63536. So x≈0.344.

So total moles =5.344, approximately 5.344 moles per mile.

Looking back at the options, option A is 5.4, which is the closest. But why is it 5.4 and not 5.34? Maybe I made a mistake in calculations, perhaps due to more precise molar masses.

Wait, let me check the molar mass of CO again. Carbon is 12.01, oxygen is 16.00. So 12.01 +16.00=28.01 g/mol. That part is correct.

Wait, maybe I should be more precise with the division. Let me compute 149.68536 divided by 28.01.

Using a calculator approach:

28.01 ) 149.68536

28.01 goes into 149 how many times? 5 times as before (5*28.01=140.05).

Subtract 140.05 from 149.68536: 9.63536.

Bring down a zero: 96.3536.

Wait, perhaps using decimal division:

28.01 )149.68536 → 

5 times 28.01 is 140.05. Subtract: 149.68536 -140.05 =9.63536.

Now, 28.01 goes into 96.3536 (after adding a decimal and a zero) how many times? 28.01 *3=84.03. 3 times would give 84.03, which is less than 96.35. 28.01*3.4= 95.234. Let's see: 3.4*28.01 = (3*28.01)+(0.4*28.01)=84.03 +11.204=95.234. 

So 3.4 times gives 95.234. Subtract from 96.3536 → 96.3536-95.234=1.1196.

Bring down a zero, making it 11.196.

How many times does 28.01 go into 11.196? 0.4 times because 28.01*0.4=11.204. So 0.4 times, but that would be a bit over, so 0.39 perhaps.

Wait, maybe it's easier to accept that 149.68536 /28.01 ≈5.344 moles.

So the closest option is A:5.4, but wait, let me check the options again. Option A is 5.4. But wait, perhaps I should check if I made a mistake in the lb to grams conversion. Wait, 0.33 lb *453.592g/lb = 149.685 grams. That's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 0.33 lb in kg? No, because molar mass is in grams. So that's correct.

Wait another thought: perhaps the question is about lb per mile, but maybe I should have considered something else. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the molar mass. Oh wait, wait! CO has a molar mass of 28.01 g/mol, correct. So that part is right.

Alternatively, perhaps the given value was 0.33 lb per mile, but perhaps I should consider 10 miles per hour. Wait, the car is traveling at 10 mph, but the emission is per mile, so the speed might not affect the per-mile emission. So I think the speed is a red herring here, and the calculation is correct as I did it.

So the answer should be approximately 5.34, which is closest to option A:5.4.

Wait, but looking again, option A is 5.4, which is a bit higher. Let me see if perhaps a more precise calculation would yield exactly 5.4.

Wait, perhaps I should do exact division.

Compute 149.68536 ÷28.01.

Let me compute 28.01 multiplied by 5.34 → 28.01 *5=140.05, 28.01 *0.34=9.5234. So 140.05 +9.5234=149.5734. 

Our numerator is 149.68536. So 149.5734 is less than that by 0.112. So 5.34 would give 149.5734, and the actual is 149.68536, so the difference is 0.112.

So 0.112 /28.01 = approximately 0.004. So total is 5.34 +0.004=5.344. So 5.344 is about 5.34 moles, which is closer to 5.3 than 5.4. So 5.34 is approximately 5.3, but the option is 5.4.

Wait, but none of the options have 5.3. The closest is option A:5.4 and option H:5.9. So 5.34 is closer to 5.4 than to 5.0. So the correct choice is A:5.4.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation somewhere. Let me try another approach. Let me compute 0.33 lb → grams: 0.33 *453.592 = 149.685 grams.

Molar mass of CO is 28.01 g/mol.

Moles =149.685 /28.01 = ?

Let me compute 28.01 *5 =140.05 → 140.05.

Subtract from 149.685 →9.635.

9.635 /28.01 → let me compute 28.01 *0.344 →9.632, as before. So 5.344.

So 5.344 is approximately 5.34, which is close to 5.3, but since the options don't have 5.3, the closest is 5.4, so option A.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Oh, wait, option A is 5.4, which is correct. So I think the correct answer is A.

To determine how many moles of CO are produced per mile, we start with the given data: the automobile emits 0.33 pounds of CO per mile. To convert this mass to moles, we need the molar mass of CO and must ensure the units are consistent.

1. **Molar Mass of CO**:  
   The molar mass of carbon monoxide (CO) is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{Molar mass of CO} = \text{Atomic mass of C} + \text{Atomic mass of O} = 12.01 + 16.00 = 28.01 \, \text{g/mol}.
   \]

2. **Convert Pounds to Grams**:  
   Since 1 pound is approximately 453.592 grams, the mass of CO emitted per mile in grams is:  
   \[
   0.33 \, \text{lb} \times 453.592 \, \text{g/lb} = 149.68536 \, \text{g}.
   \]

3. **Calculate Moles of CO**:  
   To find the number of moles, divide the mass of CO (in grams) by its molar mass:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of CO} = \frac{\text{Mass of CO}}{\text{Molar mass of CO}} = \frac{149.68536}{28.01}.
   \]  
   Performing the division:  
   \[
   149.68536 \div 28.01 \approx 5.344 \, \text{moles}.
   \]

4. **Compare with Options**:  
   The calculated value of 5.344 moles per mile is closest to option **A: 5.4 moles per mile**. Other options, such as 5.9 or 6.2, are too high, and options like 4.8 or 3.8 are too low.

Thus, the correct answer is **A: 5.4 moles per mile**.
