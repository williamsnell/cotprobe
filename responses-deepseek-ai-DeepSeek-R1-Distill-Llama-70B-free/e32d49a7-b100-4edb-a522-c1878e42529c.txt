Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay and Geiger counters. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The problem says that there's a solution containing radiophosphorus, specifically P-32, which is a beta emitter. Its half-life is 14 days. Initially, the Geiger counter records 10^3 counts per minute, which is 1000 counts per minute. Then, the same experiment is done 28 days later, and we need to find the new counting rate. The options are from A to J, and I need to choose the right one.

Wait, so the key here is understanding radioactive decay over time. I remember that the half-life is the time it takes for half of the radioactive substance to decay. Since P-32 has a half-life of 14 days, after 14 days, half of the initial quantity remains. After another 14 days (total 28 days), another half would decay, leaving a quarter of the original amount.

So initially, at time t=0, the count is 1000 cpm. After one half-life (14 days), it should drop to half, so 500 cpm. After two half-lives (28 days), it would drop by half again, so 250 cpm. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not mixing anything up.

Wait, the question says the same experiment is performed 28 days later. So the initial count is 1000 cpm at day 0. Then, 28 days later, which is two half-lives. So the remaining activity should be (1/2)^2 times the initial activity.

Oh, right, because activity decreases exponentially with time. The formula is A = A0 * (1/2)^(t / t_half). Where A is the activity after time t, A0 is the initial activity, and t_half is the half-life.

Plugging in the numbers: t is 28 days, t_half is 14. So 28/14 is 2. So A = 1000 * (1/2)^2 = 1000 * 1/4 = 250 counts per minute.

Looking at the options, option D is 250 counts/min. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Does the Geiger counter's efficiency or any other factors affect this? The problem says it's the same experiment, so the setup is the same. So the only change is the decay of the isotope. So yes, the count rate depends directly on the amount of radioactive material, which in turn depends on the number of undecayed nuclei.

Another way: each half-life reduces the count by half. So after 14 days: 500, after 28: 250. Yep, that's correct. So the answer is D.

The problem involves determining the counting rate of a Geiger counter after 28 days, given that the initial counting rate is 1000 counts per minute (cpm) and the half-life of the radiophosphorus (P-32) is 14 days. The key principle here is the exponential decay of radioactive substances, where the activity decreases by half with each half-life.

1. **Initial Activity**: At \( t = 0 \), the counting rate is \( 1000 \, \text{cpm} \).
2. **After 14 Days**: After one half-life (\( t = 14 \, \text{days} \)), the activity is reduced by half, resulting in \( 500 \, \text{cpm} \).
3. **After 28 Days**: After two half-lives (\( t = 28 \, \text{days} \)), the activity is reduced by half again, resulting in \( 250 \, \text{cpm} \).

The formula for radioactive decay is:

\[
A = A_0 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\frac{t}{t_{\text{half}}}}
\]

Substituting \( A_0 = 1000 \, \text{cpm} \), \( t = 28 \, \text{days} \), and \( t_{\text{half}} = 14 \, \text{days} \):

\[
A = 1000 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = 1000 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = 250 \, \text{cpm}
\]

Thus, the counting rate after 28 days is \( 250 \, \text{cpm} \), which corresponds to option **D**.

Answer: D
