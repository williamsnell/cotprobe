Okay, so I've got this problem here where a couple has six children, and their ages are 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16. I need to find the variance in their ages. Hmm, I remember that variance measures how spread out the numbers are. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact steps. Let me think this through.

First, I think variance is calculated by taking the average of the squared differences from the mean. Oh right, but waitâ€”there are two types of variance: population variance and sample variance. Since this is all the children, it's the population, so I should use the population variance formula.

Alright, step one is to find the mean age. Let me add up all the ages and divide by the number of children. So the ages are 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16. Let's add them: 6+8 is 14, plus 10 is 24, plus 12 is 36, plus 14 is 50, plus 16 is 66. There are six children, so the mean is 66 divided by 6. 66/6 is 11. So the mean age is 11.

Next, I need to find the squared differences from the mean for each age. Let's list each age and calculate (age - mean)^2.

Starting with 6: 6-11 is -5. Squared is 25.
8: 8-11 is -3. Squared is 9.
10: 10-11 is -1. Squared is 1.
12: 12-11 is 1. Squared is 1.
14: 14-11 is 3. Squared is 9.
16: 16-11 is 5. Squared is 25.

Now, I add up all these squared differences. So 25 + 9 is 34, plus 1 is 35, another 1 makes 36, plus 9 is 45, and another 25 brings it to 70. So the sum of squared differences is 70.

Since this is the population variance, I take the sum (70) and divide by the number of data points, which is 6. So 70 divided by 6 is approximately 11.666..., which is about 11.7.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I make mistakes. Let me recalculate the squared differences:

6: (6-11)^2 = (-5)^2 =25
8: (8-11)^2 = (-3)^2=9
10: (10-11)^2= (-1)^2=1
12: (12-11)^2= (1)^2=1
14: (14-11)^2 =3^2=9
16: (16-11)^2=5^2=25

Adding them: 25+9=34, +1=35, +1=36, +9=45, +25=70. Yep, that's correct.

70 divided by 6 is 11.666..., which is 11.7 when rounded to one decimal place. Looking at the options, option D is 11.7. So I think that's the right answer.

To find the variance in the ages of the six children, we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the mean age**:  
   The ages are 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16.  
   Sum = \(6 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 14 + 16 = 66\).  
   Mean = \(\frac{66}{6} = 11\).

2. **Compute the squared differences from the mean**:  
   - \((6 - 11)^2 = (-5)^2 = 25\)  
   - \((8 - 11)^2 = (-3)^2 = 9\)  
   - \((10 - 11)^2 = (-1)^2 = 1\)  
   - \((12 - 11)^2 = (1)^2 = 1\)  
   - \((14 - 11)^2 = (3)^2 = 9\)  
   - \((16 - 11)^2 = (5)^2 = 25\)  

3. **Sum the squared differences**:  
   \(25 + 9 + 1 + 1 + 9 + 25 = 70\).

4. **Calculate the population variance**:  
   Variance = \(\frac{\text{Sum of squared differences}}{\text{Number of data points}} = \frac{70}{6} \approx 11.7\).

Thus, the variance in ages is **11.7**, which corresponds to option **D**.
