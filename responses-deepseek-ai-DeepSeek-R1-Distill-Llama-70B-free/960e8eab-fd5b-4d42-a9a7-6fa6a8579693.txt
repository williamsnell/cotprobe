Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but I'll take it slow.

The question is about calculating the change in entropy for a gas undergoing a constant volume process. The specific heat at constant volume, Cv, is given as a function of temperature: Cv = 4.52 + 0.00737T Btu/lbm-°F. The gas starts at 175°F and is heated until it reaches 200°F. I need to find the entropy change, Δs.

I remember that entropy change for a process can be calculated using the formula Δs = ∫(dQ_rev/T). Since it's a constant volume process, dV=0, so dQ is given by Cv dT. Oh wait, right, because for constant volume, the heat transfer is related to the temperature change and the specific heat at constant volume.

So the formula becomes Δs = ∫(Cv / T) dT from the initial temperature to the final temperature. That makes sense. So I need to integrate Cv divided by T with respect to T, from T_initial to T_final.

Given that Cv is a function of T, the integral won't be straightforward. Let me write down the expression. So,

Δs = ∫ (from 175 to 200) [ (4.52 + 0.00737 T) / T ] dT.

I can split this into two parts: 4.52/T and 0.00737 T / T, which simplifies to 0.00737.

So, the integral becomes:

Δs = ∫ (4.52 / T) dT + ∫ 0.00737 dT.

Integrating term by term:

The first integral is 4.52 ln(T), evaluated from 175 to 200.

The second integral is 0.00737 * T, evaluated from 175 to 200.

So putting it all together:

Δs = [4.52 ln(T) + 0.00737 T] evaluated from T=175 to T=200.

Wait a second, let me double-check the units. Cv is in Btu/lbm-°F, and T is in °F. But since the integral is (Cv/T) dT, the units should work out, because T in denominator is in absolute temperature, right? Oh wait, wait. Oh no, because in thermodynamics, entropy uses absolute temperature in the formula. So I think I need to convert the temperatures from Fahrenheit to Rankine.

Oh right! Because when dealing with entropy equations, the temperature must be in absolute terms. So T in Kelvin or Rankine. Since the given temperatures are in Fahrenheit, I have to convert them.

So, to convert Fahrenheit to Rankine, the formula is T_R = T_F + 459.67.

So initial temperature T1 = 175 F → T1_R = 175 + 459.67 = 634.67 R.

Final temperature T2 = 200 F → T2_R = 200 + 459.67 = 659.67 R.

Wait, but in the integral, I have T in the denominator, but the Cv is expressed as a function of T in Fahrenheit. So when I substitute into the integral, I need to express Cv in terms of T_R? Or is it acceptable because in the expression (Cv/T), if T is in the same units as the denominator, it might not matter? Hmm, maybe not. Let me think.

Wait, no, the entropy equation requires that the temperature in the denominator be in absolute units. So when I write Δs = ∫ Cv(T)/T dT, the T here must be in absolute terms (like Kelvin or Rankine). So I need to adjust the Cv expression to be in terms of T_R.

Wait, but the given Cv is a function of T in Fahrenheit, like Cv = 4.52 + 0.00737 T, where T is in °F. So when T is in Fahrenheit, and I switch to T_R, which is T_F + 459.67, I need to express Cv as a function of T_R.

So substituting T = T_R - 459.67 into Cv:

Cv = 4.52 + 0.00737*(T_R - 459.67)

Let me compute that:

0.00737*(T_R -459.67) = 0.00737 T_R - (0.00737 * 459.67)

Calculating 0.00737 * 459.67:

0.00737 * 459.67 ≈ Let's compute 0.007 * 459.67 = 3.21769, and 0.00037 * 459.67 ≈ 0.170. So total approximately 3.21769 + 0.170 = 3.387. So,

Cv ≈ 4.52 + 0.00737 T_R - 3.387.

So 4.52 - 3.387 = 1.133. So,

Cv ≈ 1.133 + 0.00737 T_R.

Wait, but that complicates the integral. Alternatively, maybe it's easier to keep T in Fahrenheit but convert to Rankine when taking the ratio.

Wait, another approach: since in the integral, the term is (Cv / T) dT. If Cv is expressed in terms of T_F, and T is in Fahrenheit, then the units may not be correct. Because entropy requires T in absolute units. So perhaps a better approach is to express the integral with T in Rankine.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write everything in terms of T in Fahrenheit, but then when I do the integral, I convert T to Rankine for the denominator.

Wait, maybe it's better to proceed as follows:

The integral is from T1=175 F to T2=200 F.

But in the integrand, T must be in Rankine. So each T in the denominator is (T_F + 459.67).

So, the integral becomes:

Δs = ∫ (from 175 to 200) [ (4.52 + 0.00737 T_F) / (T_F + 459.67) ) ] dT_F.

Hmm, but that complicates the integral. Because now the denominator is T_F + 459.67.

Wait, maybe I can make a substitution. Let me set u = T_F + 459.67. Then, du = dT_F, since 459.67 is constant.

Then, T_F = u - 459.67.

So, the integral becomes:

∫ [4.52 + 0.00737*(u - 459.67)] / u * du.

Expanding the numerator:

4.52 + 0.00737 u - 0.00737*459.67.

Compute 0.00737 * 459.67:

As before, approximately 3.387.

So,

4.52 -3.387 = 1.133, so numerator becomes 1.133 + 0.00737 u.

Thus, the integral becomes:

∫ (1.133 + 0.00737 u)/u du = ∫ (1.133/u + 0.00737) du.

Which is easier to integrate.

So now, the integral is:

∫ (1.133 / u + 0.00737 ) du.

The limits change when T_F is 175 F → u = 175 + 459.67 = 634.67 R.

When T_F is 200 F → u = 659.67 R.

So the integral is from u=634.67 to u=659.67.

Integrating term by term:

Integral of 1.133/u du = 1.133 ln(u)

Integral of 0.00737 du = 0.00737 u.

So putting it together:

Δs = [1.133 ln(u) + 0.00737 u ] evaluated from 634.67 to 659.67.

Now plug in the limits:

First compute at u=659.67:

Term1 = 1.133 * ln(659.67)

Term2 = 0.00737 * 659.67

Then at u=634.67:

Term1' = 1.133 * ln(634.67)

Term2' = 0.00737 *634.67

So Δs = (Term1 + Term2) - (Term1' + Term2').

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute the natural logs.

Compute ln(659.67) and ln(634.67).

Let me approximate these using a calculator. Wait, I don't have a calculator right now, but I can approximate or perhaps use exact values.

Alternatively, perhaps I can recall that ln(600) is about 6.3969, ln(700) is about 6.5518.

Wait, 659.67 is approximately e^6.5?

Let me think: e^6 = 403.4288, e^7=1096.633. So 6.5 is about 665.14. So 659.67 is a little less than e^6.5.

Hmm, perhaps I can compute ln(659.67):

Since e^6.5 ≈665.14, so 659.67 is 665.14 -5.47.

So e^(6.5 - Δx) = 659.67 → approximation.

But perhaps for the purposes of this problem, I can compute these logarithms accurately. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the exact values.

Wait, I think the best approach is to compute them using a calculator. Since I don't have one, perhaps I can proceed by using more approximate values.

Wait, perhaps I can use the exact values:

ln(659.67) ≈ ln(660) ≈ 6.4846.

Similarly, ln(634.67) ≈ ln(635) ≈ 6.4543.

Wait, let me check: e^6=403.4288, e^6.4= about 840? Wait, no, e^6.4 is e^(6+0.4)= e^6 * e^0.4 ≈ 403.4288 * 1.4918 ≈ approx 602. So e^6.4 ≈ 602.

Wait, 6.4 → 602.

So e^6.45 → e^6.4 * e^0.05 → 602 * 1.05127 ≈ 632. So e^6.45≈632.

So ln(632)≈6.45.

Similarly, e^6.48 → e^6.4 * e^0.08 → 602 * 1.0833 → approx 602 * 1.08=651. So e^6.48≈651.

Wait, 659.67 is about 659.67. So perhaps ln(659.67)=6.488? Because e^6.48 is about 651, e^6.49 is about 659?

Wait, perhaps using a linear approximation.

Let me compute the exact value using an online calculator approach.

But since I don't have a calculator, maybe I should proceed with approximate values.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the exact values using a calculator if I had one. But for the sake of this exercise, let me proceed with approximate values.

So, let me proceed:

At u=659.67 R:

Term1 = 1.133 * ln(659.67) ≈ 1.133 * 6.488 ≈ 

1.133 *6=6.798, 1.133*0.488≈0.553. Total≈7.351.

Term2 = 0.00737 *659.67 ≈ let's compute 0.007 *659.67=4.62769, and 0.00037*659.67≈0.244. So total≈4.62769 +0.244≈4.8717.

So at upper limit: 7.351 +4.8717≈12.2227.

At u=634.67 R:

Term1' =1.133 * ln(634.67) ≈1.133*6.454≈

1.133 *6=6.798, 1.133 *0.454≈0.514. So total≈7.312.

Term2' =0.00737 *634.67 ≈ 0.007 *634.67=4.44269, 0.00037*634.67≈0.235. So total≈4.67769.

So at lower limit: 7.312 +4.67769≈11.9897.

So Δs =12.2227 -11.9897≈0.233.

Wait, about 0.233 Btu/lbm.

But looking at the options, the closest is option C:0.2784, option H:0.2157, option D:0.1206, option E:0.3588, option G:0.1745.

Wait, 0.233 isn't exactly in the options. Hmm, perhaps my approximations were off. Maybe I should compute more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, let's try another approach without substitution. Let me go back.

Alternative approach:

Δs = ∫ (Cv / T) dT from T1 to T2.

But T must be in absolute units. So, since Cv is given as a function of T in Fahrenheit, and T in the denominator must be in Rankine, perhaps I can express Cv in terms of T_R.

Wait, so T_R = T_F + 459.67.

So when T_F =175 F, T_R =634.67 R.

When T_F=200 F, T_R=659.67 R.

So, Cv =4.52 +0.00737 * T_F.

But T_F = T_R -459.67.

So substituting:

Cv =4.52 +0.00737*(T_R -459.67) =4.52 +0.00737 T_R - (0.00737 *459.67)

As I calculated earlier, 0.00737 *459.67 ≈3.387.

So,

Cv = (4.52 -3.387) + 0.00737 T_R = 1.133 +0.00737 T_R.

So, now, the integral becomes:

Δs = ∫ (1.133 +0.00737 T_R)/T_R dT_R.

Which simplifies to:

∫ [1.133 / T_R +0.00737 ] dT_R.

Now, integrating from T_R=634.67 to 659.67.

So,

Δs = [1.133 ln(T_R) +0.00737 T_R ] evaluated from 634.67 to 659.67.

Now, compute each term accurately.

Compute each term at upper limit (659.67) and lower limit (634.67):

At upper limit (659.67 R):

Term1_upper =1.133 * ln(659.67)

Term2_upper=0.00737 *659.67.

At lower limit (634.67 R):

Term1_lower=1.133 * ln(634.67)

Term2_lower=0.00737 *634.67.

Compute each:

First, exact ln values.

Using a calculator (pretending):

ln(634.67) ≈6.4543,

ln(659.67)≈6.4889.

So,

Term1_upper=1.133 *6.4889≈1.133*6.4889.

Compute 1 *6.4889=6.4889, 0.133*6.4889≈0.8623.

So Term1_upper≈6.4889 +0.8623≈7.3512.

Term2_upper=0.00737 *659.67.

Compute 0.007 *659.67=4.62769,

0.00037*659.67≈0.244.

So Term2_upper≈4.62769 +0.244≈4.8717.

So upper sum=7.3512 +4.8717≈12.2229.

Lower limit:

Term1_lower=1.133 *6.4543.

Compute 1 *6.4543=6.4543,

0.133*6.4543≈0.856.

So Term1_lower≈6.4543 +0.856≈7.3103.

Term2_lower=0.00737 *634.67.

0.007 *634.67=4.44269,

0.00037 *634.67≈0.235.

So Term2_lower≈4.44269 +0.235≈4.6777.

Lower sum=7.3103 +4.6777≈11.988.

So Δs=12.2229 -11.988=0.2349 Btu/lbm.

Hmm, approximately 0.235 Btu/lbm.

Looking at the options:

A: 0.1843

B: 0.00737

C:0.2784

D:0.1206

E:0.3588

F:0.4002

G:0.1745

H:0.2157

I:0.0935

J:0.0458

Wait, none of the options are exactly 0.235. The closest is option H: 0.2157 and option C:0.2784.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Alternatively, perhaps the approach should have been different.

Alternative approach: Maybe I should have kept T in Fahrenheit and adjusted the integral accordingly. Wait, no, because entropy requires absolute temperature.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should have used the average Cv over the temperature range and multiplied by ln(T2/T1) in absolute terms.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered that the integral of Cv/T dT is the same as integrating (A + BT)/T dT, which is A ln(T) + B T, which is what I did.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should not have converted Cv into a function of T_R. Maybe I can proceed with T in Fahrenheit but as the denominator, use T_R = T_F + 459.67.

Let me try that approach.

So, the integral is:

Δs = ∫ (Cv / T_R) dT_F.

Because T_R = T_F +459.67, so dT_R = dT_F.

So, Δs = ∫ (Cv / (T_F +459.67)) dT_F.

Now, Cv =4.52 +0.00737 T_F.

So,

Δs = ∫ [ (4.52 +0.00737 T_F) / (T_F +459
