Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a neutron and the electrostatic force between its quarks. Hmm. Let me think through this step by step.

Wait, a neutron is made of quarks, right? From what I remember, a neutron has one up quark and two down quarks. The up quark has a charge of +2e/3, and each down quark is -e/3. But the question is about the force between the down quarks. Oh right, because the neutron is neutral overall, but each quark has its own charge.

So the problem gives me that the two down quarks are 2.6e-15 meters apart. I need to find the electrostatic force between them. Oh, right, Coulomb's Law here. Coulomb's Law is F = k * |q1 * q2| / r².

Wait, what's the value of Coulomb's constant? I think it's approximately 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C². But sometimes people round it to 9e9 for simplicity. Maybe in this problem, that's what I should use.

Each down quark has a charge of -e/3. But since we're taking the magnitude, the signs don't matter; the force will be attractive, but the question asks for magnitude. So the product of the charges will be (e/3) * (e/3). Wait, no, because each is -e/3, so when multiplied, it's positive. But again, since we're taking magnitude, just (e/3)^2.

Wait, what's the value of e, the elementary charge? I think it's about 1.602 x 10^-19 coulombs. So plugging that in, each down quark's charge is (1.602e-19 C)/3. So the product is (1.602e-19 /3)^2.

Let me jot down the numbers. So:

q1 = q2 = -e/3 → |q1*q2| = (e/3)^2 = (1.602e-19 C /3)^2.

r is 2.6e-15 m. 

So putting it into Coulomb's Law:

F = k * ( (e/3)^2 ) / r²

Let me compute this step by step.

First, calculate e/3: 1.602e-19 /3 ≈ 5.34e-20 C.

Then square that: (5.34e-20)^2 = (5.34)^2 * 1e-40 → 28.5e-40 → wait, 5.34 squared is 28.5? Let me check: 5^2 is 25, 0.34^2 is about 0.1156, and cross terms 2*5*0.34=3.4. So (5+0.34)^2 ≈ 5² + 2*5*0.34 + 0.34² = 25 + 3.4 + 0.1156=28.5156. So approximately 28.5156e-40 C². Hmm, more accurately, 5.34^2 is 28.5 so 28.5e-40.

Wait, but wait: (5.34e-20)^2 = (5.34)^2 x (1e-20)^2 = 28.5 x 1e-40 = 2.85e-39? Wait no, 28.5e-40 is 2.85e-39, correct.

So the numerator in Coulomb's Law is k times that. Coulomb's constant k is approx 9e9 N·m²/C².

So numerator: 9e9 * 2.85e-39 C²·N·m²/C²... Wait, so the units would be Newtons·m², but we're dividing by r squared, which is in m². So F will be in Newtons.

Putting in the numbers: 9e9 * 2.85e-39 = let's compute 9 * 2.85 first. 9*2=18, 9*0.85=7.65 → total 25.65. So 25.65e(9-39) → 25.65e-30 → 2.565e-29.

Wait wait wait, wait a second. 9e9 is 9 x 10^9. 2.85e-39 is 2.85 x 10^-39. Multiplying them: 9 * 2.85 is 25.65, and 10^9 *10^-39 is 10^-30. So 25.65e-30 → which is 2.565e-29 N·m²? But wait, no, because we're dividing by r² (in m²) so the m² in the numerator and denominator will cancel.

Wait, let me correct. The denominator is r squared: (2.6e-15 m)^2. So 2.6 squared is 6.76, so 6.76e-30 m².

So F = (9e9) * (2.85e-39) / (6.76e-30)

Wait, wait no. Let me recompute. The product k*(q1q2) is (9e9) * (2.85e-39) = 2.565e-29 N·m² (since C² cancels, and N·m²/C² * C² gives N·m²). Then divide by (2.6e-15)^2 = 6.76e-30 m².

So F = (2.565e-29 N·m²) / (6.76e-30 m²) → 2.565e-29 /6.76e-30 → Let's compute that division.

2.565e-29 divided by 6.76e-30 is approximately (2.565 /6.76) * (1e-29 /1e-30) )= (approx 0.379) * 10 = approx 3.79 N.

Wait wait, let me do that calculation more accurately.

2.565 /6.76 → let me compute 6.76 × 0.379 = ?

6 × 0.379 = 2.274, 0.76 ×0.379 ≈ 0.288, so total ≈ 2.562. So 6.76 × 0.379 ≈ 2.562, which is close to 2.565. So yes, 2.565/6.76 is approximately 0.379.

Then multiply by 10, because 1e-29 /1e-30 is 10. So 0.379 *10 = approx 3.79 N.

Looking at the options, option D is 3.8 N. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but let me double-check all the steps because sometimes rounding can cause errors.

Alternative approach: Compute each step with precise numbers.

Compute q1*q2: (e/3)^2 = (1.602e-19 /3)^2 = (5.34e-20)^2 = (5.34)^2 *1e-40 = 28.5e-40 = 2.85e-39 C².

Then, k=8.988e9 N·m²/C².

So F = (8.988e9) * (2.85e-39) / ( (2.6e-15)^2 )

Compute numerator: 8.988e9 * 2.85e-39 = let's compute 8.988 *2.85 = let's see:

8 * 2.85 =22.8, 0.988 *2.85 ≈ 2.8148 → total ≈ 22.8 +2.8148=25.6148.

So 25.6148e(9-39) → 25.6148e-30 → 2.56148e-29.

Denominator: (2.6e-15)^2 =6.76e-30 m².

F = (2.56148e-29) / (6.76e-30) = (2.56148 /6.76) * (1e-29 /1e-30 )

Compute 2.56148 /6.76 → approximately 0.379.

Multiply by 10 → 3.79 N.

So again, approximately 3.8 N, which is option D.

Another point to check: Did I mix up quark charges? The problem states that the neutron has one up quark (charge +2e/3) and two down quarks (-e/3 each). But the question is about the two down quarks, so each has charge -e/3. So yes, the product is (e²/9 ), so that part was correct.

Another possible mistake: Forgetting to square the distance. But in the calculation, I squared 2.6e-15 correctly to get 6.76e-30 m². So that's correct.

So the conclusion is that the force is approximately 3.8 N, which is option D.

To calculate the magnitude of the electrostatic force between the two down quarks in a neutron, we use Coulomb's Law:

\[
F = k \cdot \frac{|q_1 \cdot q_2|}{r^2}
\]

### Step 1: Identify the given values
- Charge of each down quark: \( q_1 = q_2 = -\frac{e}{3} \), where \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{C} \).
- Distance between the quarks: \( r = 2.6 \times 10^{-15} \, \mathrm{m} \).
- Coulomb's constant: \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \mathrm{N \cdot m^2 / C^2} \).

### Step 2: Calculate the product of the charges
The magnitude of the product of the charges is:

\[
|q_1 \cdot q_2| = \left(\frac{e}{3}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1.602 \times 10^{-19}}{3}\right)^2 = (5.34 \times 10^{-20})^2 = 2.85 \times 10^{-39} \, \mathrm{C^2}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the denominator \( r^2 \)
\[
r^2 = (2.6 \times 10^{-15})^2 = 6.76 \times 10^{-30} \, \mathrm{m^2}.
\]

### Step 4: Apply Coulomb's Law
Substitute the values into the formula:

\[
F = \frac{(8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (2.85 \times 10^{-39})}{6.76 \times 10^{-30}}.
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
(8.988 \times 10^9) \cdot (2.85 \times 10^{-39}) = 2.561 \times 10^{-29} \, \mathrm{N \cdot m^2}.
\]

Now divide by the denominator:

\[
F = \frac{2.561 \times 10^{-29}}{6.76 \times 10^{-30}} = \frac{2.561}{6.76} \cdot 10 = 3.79 \, \mathrm{N}.
\]

### Step 5: Match the result to the closest option
The calculated force is approximately \( 3.8 \, \mathrm{N} \), which corresponds to **option D**.
