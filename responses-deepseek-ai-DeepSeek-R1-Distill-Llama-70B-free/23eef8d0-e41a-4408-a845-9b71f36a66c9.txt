Okay, so I've got this question here about TV series and their settings. The question is asking which one wasn't set in the United States. The options are A through J, each being a different show. Let me try to think through each one.

First, I'll list out all the options to keep track:

A: Grey's Anatomy
B: Boston Legal
C: Breaking Bad
D: Northern Exposure
E: The Paper Chase
F: Friends
G: M*A*S*H
H: Picket Fences
I: The X-Files
J: The West Wing

I need to figure out where each show is set. Let's go one by one.

A: Grey's Anatomy. I know this is a medical drama. The setting is a hospital. I think it's in Seattle, Washington. So that's definitely in the US.

B: Boston Legal. The name gives it away with "Boston," which is a city in Massachusetts, USA. So this is set in the US.

C: Breaking Bad. I remember this is set in Albuquerque, New Mexico. That's in the US as well.

D: Northern Exposure. Hmm, I'm not too sure about this one. I think it's set in a small town in Alaska. Alaska is a US state, so that's still in the US.

E: The Paper Chase. This is a show about law students. I think the setting is Harvard Law School, which is in Massachusetts. So US again.

F: Friends. This is a classic sitcom set in New York City. Definitely US.

G: M*A*S*H. Wait, this one might be different. I know M*A*S*H is about a military hospital during the Korean War. But where was it set? Oh wait, the setting is actually in South Korea, right? Because it's about the Korean War. So this might be the one not set in the US.

H: Picket Fences. I think this is a small town drama. The town is probably in the US, maybe somewhere like Wisconsin or another state. So US setting.

I: The X-Files. This is a sci-fi drama that follows FBI agents. The stories are set in various places, but the main setting is in the US. They often deal with cases in different states.

J: The West Wing. This is about the White House staff. The White House is in Washington D.C., so definitely US.

So reviewing, all except G: M*A*S*H are set in the US. M*A*S*H is set in South Korea during the war. So the correct answer should be G.

The television series not set in the United States is M*A*S*H, as it is set in South Korea during the Korean War.

Answer: G
