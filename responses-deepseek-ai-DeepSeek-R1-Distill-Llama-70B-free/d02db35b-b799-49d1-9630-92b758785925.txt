Question:

What properties of water make it an essential component of living matter?

Options:

A: Water is abundant, a good solvent, regulates heat, serves as a lubricant, aids in transport of nutrients, and maintains osmotic relationships.
B: Water is detrimental to the regulation of heat in the body.
C: Water is a poor solvent, making it unsuitable for chemical reactions in cells.
D: Water provides no thermal insulation and cannot dissolve gases.
E: Water is not involved in maintaining structural integrity of biological molecules.
F: Water is only involved in the transport of nutrients, but has no role in heat regulation or as a solvent.
G: Water is scarce and difficult to dissolve substances in.
H: Water's high surface tension is detrimental to the movement of substances in living organisms.
I: Water has a low heat capacity, which makes it ineffective in temperature regulation.
J: Water serves no functional purpose in living organisms.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about water and its properties in living organisms. Hmm, I need to think through each option carefully. 

The question is asking what properties of water make it essential for living matter. I remember from my biology classes that water has several important roles. Let me try to recall them.

First off, water is a universal solvent. That means it can dissolve a lot of substances, which is crucial for chemical reactions in cells. So any option that says water is a poor solvent is probably wrong. Looking at the options, option C says water is a poor solvent, so I can eliminate that.

Next, water helps regulate temperature. I think it's because of its high specific heat capacity. Specific heat is the amount of heat required to change the temperature of a gram of substance. Water has a high specific heat, so it can absorb and release a lot of heat without a big temperature change. This helps organisms maintain a stable body temperature. That means any option that says water is bad at regulating heat is incorrect. Option B says water is detrimental to heat regulation, so B is out. Option I mentions low heat capacity, which is the opposite of what's true, so I can eliminate I too.

Water also acts as a lubricant. For example, it's found in joints and helps reduce friction. So any option that doesn't mention this might be incomplete. Also, water aids in transporting nutrients. The circulatory system uses water-based solutions like blood to move nutrients around the body. So options that say water isn't involved in transport are wrong. Option F says water is only for transport and not for heat or solvent roles, so F is incorrect.

Another point is osmotic relationships. Water's role in osmoregulation is important for maintaining the balance of fluids within cells. So any option that doesn't include that might be missing something. Also, water is abundant in living organisms, which makes sense because it's a major component of cells.

Looking at the options again, option A lists several properties: abundant, good solvent, regulates heat, serves as a lubricant, aids in transport of nutrients, and maintains osmotic relationships. That sounds comprehensive and matches what I remember. Let me check the other options to make sure.

Option D says water provides no thermal insulation and can't dissolve gases. Wait, isn't water known for dissolving gases, albeit maybe not as well as other liquids? Also, thermal insulation isn't really water's main role, but the high heat capacity does help with temperature regulation. So D is incorrect.

Option E says water isn't involved in structural integrity of biological molecules. I think water does play a role in the structure of molecules like proteins, helping them maintain their shape. So E is wrong.

Option G claims water is scarce and hard to dissolve substances. But water is actually quite abundant, especially in cells, and it's a good solvent, so G is incorrect.

Option H says high surface tension is detrimental. Wait, high surface tension is actually beneficial in some ways, like in the movement of water in plants through capillary action. So H is wrong.

Option J is obviously incorrect because water is essential.

So putting it all together, the correct answer must be option A. It includes all the important properties that make water essential for living organisms.

The correct answer is **A** because it accurately lists the essential properties of water that make it vital for living matter. These include being abundant, a good solvent, regulating heat, acting as a lubricant, aiding in nutrient transport, and maintaining osmotic relationships. Other options either contradict known properties of water or omit key roles, making them incorrect.

Answer: A
