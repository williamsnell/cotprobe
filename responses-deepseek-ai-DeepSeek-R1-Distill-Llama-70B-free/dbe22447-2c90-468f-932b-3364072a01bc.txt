Question:

A shrimp fishery is located in the coastal waters of a state. A large part of the catch is either frozen or canned, and distributed nationwide. The state legislature passed a statute requiring payment of a license fee of $25 for each shrimp boat owned by a resident and $2,500 for each boat owned by a nonresident. A resident of a neighboring state was a commercial shrimp fisherman who was denied a license after refusing to pay the $2,500 fee. The resident brought suit in federal court challenging the constitutionality of the state shrimp boat licensing statute. The federal court should

Options:

A: hear the case on its merits.
B: abstain from jurisdiction because it involves the operations of a commercial business.
C: dismiss the case because the resident is not a citizen of the state implementing the statute.
D: dismiss the suit because it involves a question of state law.
E: hear the case but uphold the statute as it is within the state's rights to regulate its resources.
F: hear the case because it involves a potential violation of the Equal Protection Clause.
G: dismiss the suit because the resident lacks standing.
H: dismiss the suit because the resident has not exhausted all state-level legal remedies.
I: abstain from jurisdiction because the constitutional issue should be litigated first in a state court.
J: dismiss the suit because the federal court lacks jurisdiction over state legislature decisions.

Okay, so I've got this question about constitutional law, specifically dealing with federal court jurisdiction and state statutes. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question is about a shrimp fishery located in a state's coastal waters. The state legislature passed a statute that charges different license fees based on whether the shrimp boat owner is a resident or a nonresident. Residents pay $25 per boat, while nonresidents have to pay $2,500. A nonresident commercial fisherman is suing in federal court because he was denied a license when he refused to pay the higher fee.

The issue here is whether the federal court should hear the case and what they should do. The options are from A to J, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that when a state law is challenged in federal court, especially on constitutional grounds, the federal court has the authority to hear such cases under the Supremacy Clause. So I think the federal courts don't just dismiss these cases without looking into them.

The statute in question charges nonresidents much more than residents. That's a big differenceâ€”$25 vs. $2,500. This seems like it could be a violation of the Equal Protection Clause because it treats residents and nonresidents differently. The Equal Protection Clause applies to states through the Fourteenth Amendment, so the state can't deny any person equal protection under the law.

I recall the Supreme Court case Toomer v. Witsell, which dealt with commercial fishermen and license fees. In that case, the Court held that South Carolina's higher fees for nonresident shrimp boats violated the Equal Protection Clause. The reasoning was that while states have an interest in conserving resources and managing their fisheries, the discrimination against nonresidents must have a substantial reason. If the fee difference isn't closely related to the costs incurred by nonresidents, it's unconstitutional.

So applying that here, the state's statute likely violates equal protection because the fee disparity is significant and probably not justified by a substantial state interest. Therefore, the federal court should consider this constitutional challenge.

Looking at the options, let's go through them:

A: Hear the case on its merits. That's possible because it's a constitutional issue, so the federal court can decide if the statute is lawful.

B: Abstain because it's a commercial business operation. No, federal courts don't abstain just because it's a business matter. They handle such cases, especially if there's a constitutional question.

C: Dismiss because the plaintiff isn't a state citizen. That's incorrect because the federal court can hear cases where a state law is challenged on constitutional grounds, regardless of the plaintiff's residency.

D: Dismiss as a state law question. No, because the challenge is on federal constitutional grounds, so federal courts have jurisdiction.

E: Hear and uphold the statute. But based on Toomer v. Witsell, the statute is likely unconstitutional, so E is probably wrong.

F: Hear because it involves Equal Protection. Yes, this seems right because the issue is about unequal treatment of nonresidents.

G: Dismiss for lack of standing. The plaintiff is a nonresident affected by the law, so he has standing. G is incorrect.

H: Dismiss for not exhausting state remedies. Federal courts can hear constitutional challenges without requiring plaintiffs to go through state courts first, especially when seeking injunctions or monetary damages. So H isn't the right choice.

I: Abstain to let state courts decide the constitutional issue first. The Supreme Court has rules against federal abstention in many cases, especially when it's a straightforward constitutional challenge. So I is probably not correct.

J: Dismiss for lack of jurisdiction over state legislature. No, federal courts have jurisdiction to review the constitutionality of state laws under the Supremacy Clause.

So the correct answer should be F: the federal court should hear the case because it involves a potential Equal Protection violation. Alternatively, A is about hearing on merits, which is also true, but F specifies the reason related to Equal Protection, which is more precise.

Wait, but option E says the court should uphold the statute. But as per Toomer, the statute is likely invalid, so E is wrong. So the court should hear it, and considering the merits, they'd probably strike it down. So the correct choice is F because the case involves an Equal Protection issue, which the federal court must address.

The question involves a state statute that imposes significantly different license fees on resident and nonresident shrimp boat owners ($25 vs. $2,500). A nonresident fisherman challenged this statute in federal court, arguing it violates the Equal Protection Clause. The federal court's role in this case is to determine whether the statute is constitutional under federal law.

The statute's disparate treatment of residents and nonresidents raises a clear Equal Protection issue. Under the Fourteenth Amendment, states cannot discriminate against nonresidents without a substantial justification. The Supreme Court's decision in *Toomer v. Witsell* establishes that such significant fee disparities for nonresidents in commercial fishing licenses are unconstitutional unless closely tied to substantial state interests, which is not evident here. Therefore, the federal court should hear the case to evaluate this constitutional challenge.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: While the court could hear the case on its merits, this option does not address the specific constitutional issue at hand.
- **B**: Federal courts do not abstain from cases involving commercial businesses, especially when constitutional issues are raised.
- **C**: The plaintiff's nonresident status does not preclude federal court jurisdiction over a constitutional challenge.
- **D**: The case involves federal constitutional questions, so it is not solely a state law issue.
- **E**: The statute is likely unconstitutional under *Toomer v. Witsell*, so upholding it would be incorrect.
- **F**: This is correct because the case involves a potential violation of the Equal Protection Clause, which the federal court must address.
- **G**: The plaintiff has standing as a nonresident directly affected by the statute.
- **H**: Federal courts can hear constitutional challenges without requiring exhaustion of state remedies.
- **I**: Federal courts do not abstain from deciding straightforward constitutional issues like this one.
- **J**: Federal courts have jurisdiction to review the constitutionality of state laws under the Supremacy Clause.

The best answer is **F**, as the case involves a potential violation of the Equal Protection Clause, which the federal court must evaluate.

Answer: F
