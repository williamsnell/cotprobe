Okay, so I'm looking at this genetics problem here. Hmm, let's see. The question is about minks and their fur color. The gene for brown fur is dominant, B, and silver is recessive, b. Right, so dominant means you only need one copy to show that trait. Recessive means you need two copies.

The question is asking which set of genotypes from parents that both have brown fur could produce offspring with silver fur. Oh wait, so both parents are brown, but they could have a child with silver fur. Silver is recessive, so the child must have bb genotype.

So, for that to happen, each parent must contribute a b allele. That means each parent must have at least one b. But wait, the parents themselves are brown, so their possible genotypes are either BB or Bb. Because if they had bb, they'd be silver.

So looking at the options, I need to find a cross where both parents are either Bb or BB (because BB is homozygous dominant, which would also be brown). But wait, if a parent is BB, then they can only give B. So if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the possible offspring would get B from the BB parent and either B or b from the Bb parent. So the possible offspring are BB or Bb, both of which are brown. So that won't give a silver offspring.

If both parents are Bb, then each can give either B or b. So the possible combinations are BB, Bb, or bb. Oh wait, so there's a 25% chance of each child being bb, which would be silver. So that's possible.

Looking at the options, I need a cross where both parents are Bb. So let me check the options. Option C is Bb Bb. That's exactly what I thought. Another option is D: Bb bb. Wait, but the parents both have brown fur. So the parents can't be bb, because that would make them silver. So option D's second parent is bb, which would be silver, but the question says both parents are brown. So D is out. Same with option F, which is bb and Bb. Again, one parent is silver, which can't be.

Option C is Bb and Bb. That fits because both are brown, and their cross can produce a silver offspring.

Wait, are there any other options? Let's see. Option H is Bb Bb Bb. That's three parents? No, that doesn't make sense. So probably option C is the answer.

Another thought: could both parents be BB? No, because BB can't pass a b allele, so all offspring would be BB, which is brown. So any cross where parents are BB Ã— anything won't give silver. So the only way is when both are Bb.

So the correct option is C: Bb Bb.

In minks, the gene for brown fur (B) is dominant over the gene for silver fur (b). For offspring to have silver fur, they must have the recessive genotype (bb). This requires both parents to contribute a recessive allele (b). Since both parents have brown fur, their possible genotypes are either BB (homozygous dominant) or Bb (heterozygous). However, if both parents are BB, they can only pass on the dominant allele (B), and no silver offspring would be produced. 

If both parents are Bb, each can pass on either the dominant (B) or recessive (b) allele. This results in possible offspring genotypes of BB, Bb, or bb, with a 25% chance of producing a silver (bb) offspring. 

Analyzing the options:
- **Option C (Bb Bb):** Both parents are heterozygous, allowing for the production of silver offspring. This is valid.
- **Option D (Bb bb):** One parent is bb, which corresponds to silver fur. Since the question specifies that both parents have brown fur, this is invalid.
- **Option F (bb Bb):** Similar to Option D, one parent is bb, which is invalid.
- **Option H (Bb Bb Bb):** This implies three parents, which is not possible.
- Other options either involve parents with genotypes that cannot produce silver offspring or include invalid scenarios.

Thus, the correct answer is **C: Bb Bb**, as it represents a valid cross where both parents have brown fur and can produce silver offspring.
