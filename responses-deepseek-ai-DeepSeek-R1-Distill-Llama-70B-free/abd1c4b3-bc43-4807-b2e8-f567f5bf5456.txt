Okay, so I've got this question about microscopes and magnification. Hmm, I remember that microscopes use two lenses: the objective and the ocular. The total magnification is the product of the objective's magnification and the ocular's, right?

Wait, the question says the objective has a lateral magnification of 10x. Oh wait, lateral magnificationâ€”so that's the linear magnification. But in microscopes, sometimes it's called the objective providing a certain magnification, like 10x, and the ocular another, like maybe 10x as well. So the total would be 10x * 10x = 100x. But wait, this question is a bit different.

Wait, the overall magnification they're asking for is 100x. So the equation must be M_total = M_objective * M_ocular. So given that M_objective is 10x, we need M_ocular to be 10x as well. Because 10 * 10 = 100.

Wait, but wait a second. Another thought: sometimes, the ocular's magnification is given in terms of its focal length. Oh right, because the ocular acts like a magnifying glass. The magnification of the ocular depends on the focal length of the ocular lens and the distance between the lenses, but wait, no, the ocular's magnification is usually given by the formula M_ocular = (25 cm) / f_ocular, where 25 cm is the near point of the human eye. Wait, but I'm not entirely sure if that's correct in this context.

Wait, no, that's for the magnifying power when using the ocular as a simple magnifier. In a microscope, the ocular is used in a different way. Oh wait, I think I'm getting mixed up. Let me think again.

In a compound microscope, the total magnification is roughly the product of the objective magnification (which is given as 10x here) and the ocular magnification. So if the total is 100x, then the ocular must contribute 10x. So M_ocular = 100x / 10x = 10x.

But how do I find the focal length of the ocular? Well, the magnification of the ocular when used in the microscope is given by M_ocular = (f_objective) / (f_ocular). Or is it the other way around? Wait, another approach. Wait, I recall that the magnification of the ocular is M_ocular = (25 cm) / f_ocular when used as a magnifying glass, but I'm not sure if that's applicable here.

Alternatively, maybe the formula for the microscope's magnification is M_total = M_objective * M_ocular. So given M_total is 100, M_objective is 10, so M_ocular must be 10.

But how does that relate to the focal length? Oh, right, in the microscope setup, the magnification of the ocular is determined by its focal length. Wait, perhaps the formula is M_ocular = (tube length) / (f_ocular). Because the tube length is the distance between the objective and ocular. Wait, or is it (f_objective + f_ocular) / f_ocular? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the standard microscope formula. The total magnification is the product of the objective magnification and the ocular magnification. The objective's magnification is given, so 10x. So M_ocular must be 10x to get 100x total.

But how does the ocular's magnification relate to its focal length? I think that in the microscope, the ocular is used as an eyepiece, which forms a virtual image of the real image created by the objective. The magnification of the eyepiece is given by M = (25 cm) / f_ocular, where 25 cm is the near point. But wait, no, that's when the eyepiece is used as a simple magnifier. In a microscope, the eyepiece's magnification is typically considered as a power, like 10x, which would correspond to a focal length of, say, 5 cm if 10x is 25 cm / f_ocular.

Wait, let me clarify. The magnifying power M of a simple magnifier is M = 25 cm / f, where f is the focal length. So if the ocular has a magnifying power of 10x, then f_ocular would be 25 cm / 10 = 2.5 cm. So the ocular's focal length would be 2.5 cm.

Wait, but in the context of a microscope, sometimes the eyepiece's magnification is given as M_ocular = (f_tube) / (f_ocular), where f_tube is the tube length (distance from objective to eyepiece). But I don't have the tube length here. So maybe it's better to think in terms of the simple magnifier approach.

So if M_ocular needs to be 10x, then f_ocular = 25 cm / 10 = 2.5 cm. Looking at the options, option D is 2.5 cm. So the answer would be D.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes the magnification formula in microscopes is M_total = M_objective * ( ( f_objective + f_ocular ) / f_ocular ), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe the magnification of the ocular in the microscope is f_objective / f_ocular. Wait, that might be another way.

Wait, the lateral magnification of the objective is given as 10x. The formula for lateral magnification is M = (image height)/(object height) = - (image distance)/(object distance). But in a microscope, it's a bit more involved. Maybe I should think in terms of the microscope formula: M_total = M_objective * M_ocular.

So the given M_objective is 10x, M_total desired is 100x, so M_ocular must be 10x. Then, using the simple magnifier formula, M_ocular = 25 cm / f_ocular. So f_ocular = 25 cm / 10 = 2.5 cm. So D is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the ocular's magnification is f_tube / f_ocular, but without knowing f_tube, I can't use that approach. So the correct approach is to use the simple magnifier formula, which gives f_ocular as 2.5 cm.

To determine the focal length of the ocular lens that produces an overall magnification of 100x in a compound microscope, we start with the relationship for total magnification:

\[
M_{\text{total}} = M_{\text{objective}} \cdot M_{\text{ocular}}
\]

The problem states that the objective has a magnification of \( M_{\text{objective}} = 10x \), and the desired total magnification is \( M_{\text{total}} = 100x \). Substituting these values:

\[
100 = 10 \cdot M_{\text{ocular}}
\]

Solving for \( M_{\text{ocular}} \), we find:

\[
M_{\text{ocular}} = 10
\]

The magnification of the ocular lens is related to its focal length by the formula:

\[
M_{\text{ocular}} = \frac{25 \, \text{cm}}{f_{\text{ocular}}}
\]

Rearranging for \( f_{\text{ocular}} \):

\[
f_{\text{ocular}} = \frac{25 \, \text{cm}}{M_{\text{ocular}}}
\]

Substituting \( M_{\text{ocular}} = 10 \):

\[
f_{\text{ocular}} = \frac{25 \, \text{cm}}{10} = 2.5 \, \text{cm}
\]

Thus, the focal length of the ocular lens must be 2.5 cm. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**D: 2.5 cm**
