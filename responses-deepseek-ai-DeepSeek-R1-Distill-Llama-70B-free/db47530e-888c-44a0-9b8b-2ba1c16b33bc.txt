Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about which countries have sent landers to Venus. The options are a bit tricky because some are individual countries and others are combinations. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the Soviet Union sent several probes to Venus. The Venera program comes to mind. They successfully landed several probes on Venus, starting from Venera 7, which was the first to send back data from the surface. So the U.S.S.R., which is option C, definitely did this.

Next, I think about the United States. I'm trying to recall if NASA has sent a lander to Venus. The most famous Venus mission from the U.S. is probably Magellan, but that was an orbiter, not a lander. There's also the Pioneer Venus project, which included a multiprobe mission. I believe one of those did land on Venus, so that means the U.S., option H, has sent a lander.

Then there's Japan. I remember JAXA, the Japanese space agency, sent the Akatsuki probe to Venus. But wait, Akatsuki is an orbiter, not a lander. I don't think Japan has successfully landed on Venus yet. So option F, Japan, might not be correct.

What about other countries? France, option D, I don't recall sending a Venus lander. They've been involved in other planetary missions, maybe with the Soviet Union or as part of ESA, but not a solo lander. Brazil, option E, I don't think has sent any probes to Venus. They have a small space program, mostly focusing on Earth orbit and maybe the Moon.

Germany, option G, I'm not sure. I know they contribute to ESA missions, but not a solo lander to Venus. India, option I, has done some impressive missions like Mars Orbiter Mission, but I don't think they've sent a lander to Venus yet. China, option J, has their own lunar missions and are active in space, but I don't recall a Venus lander from them.

So, putting this together, the countries that have sent landers to Venus are the Soviet Union (C) and the United States (H). Now looking back at the options, option B is "A and B", but wait, the options A to J are individual countries. Oh wait, the options are a bit confusing. Let me check the structure again.

Wait, the options given are A through J, where each is a selection. So the question is, which of the following countries have sent landers. The options are: A is A, B, and C (but I don't know what A, B, C refer to here because the actual countries are options C, H, etc.), so perhaps the options are structured differently. Let me read the question again.

The options are A to J, each representing a selection. So, the first part lists options where A, B, etc., are combinations or individual countries. Let me parse the options carefully.

Looking again:

Options include:

A: A, B, and C

B: A and B

C: The U.S.S.R.

D: France

E: Brazil

F: Japan

G: Germany

H: The U.S.

I: India

J: China

So each option is a possible answer, like A says "A, B, and C" which refers to the first three options as the correct countries. But wait, that can't be right because the options are individual letters. Hmm, perhaps the options A-J are the possible correct answers, each being a combination or single country.

Wait, the question is, "Which of the following countries has sent landers to Venus?" and the options are A to J, each being a choice, which could be a single country or a combination.

Wait, no, the way it's structured, each option (A to J) is a possible answer, where each option represents a selection of countries. For example, option A says "A, B, and C", but I'm not sure what A, B, C refer to here. Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me re-examine the question.

Wait, perhaps the options are structured as follows: the possible answers are combinations of countries, where each option (A-J) represents a group. But I'm getting a bit tangled.

Alternatively, perhaps it's a standard multiple-choice where each option is a possible correct answer, and the letters A-J are the options. So, which country among the options has sent landers.

Wait, no, the question is which of the following countries (plural) have sent landers, so the correct answer would be multiple countries. But the options are A-J, each being a possible answer, which could be a single country or a combination.

Wait, perhaps the options are like this:

Each option (A to J) is a possible answer, where the options are either a single country or a combination. For example, option C is "The U.S.S.R.", option H is "The U.S.", etc.

So the correct answer is that both the Soviet Union and the United States have sent landers to Venus. So looking for an option that includes both.

Looking at the options, option B is "A and B". Hmm, but I don't know what A and B refer to. Alternatively, perhaps the options are not arranged that way.

Wait, perhaps the initial question's options are a list of countries, and the possible answers are combinations. Let me try to re-express the options.

Wait, perhaps the options are as follows:

The question is, which of the following has sent landers to Venus? The options are:

A: A, B, and C (but A, B, C are not defined here)

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of which individual options are correct.

From earlier, I determined that the Soviet Union (option C) and the U.S. (option H) have sent landers. So the correct answer would be an option that includes both C and H.

Looking at the options provided:

Option B: A and B. But I don't know what A and B are. Alternatively, perhaps the options are structured differently.

Wait, perhaps all the options are individual countries except for A and B, which are combinations. Let me check the user's question again.

The options are:

A: A, B, and C

B: A and B

C: The U.S.S.R.

D: France

E: Brazil

F: Japan

G: Germany

H: The U.S.

I: India

J: China

So, the correct answer is that both the U.S.S.R. (option C) and the U.S. (option H) have sent landers. So the correct option should include both C and H.

Looking at the options, I don't see an option that includes both C and H. Let's look again.

Option A: A, B, and C. But since A, B, and C are options themselves, perhaps this is a grouping. Wait, no, perhaps the options are mislabeled. Alternatively, perhaps the options are structured as possible correct answers, each being a country or a combination.

Wait, perhaps the labels are mixed up. Let me think differently. I'll list the options again:

Option A: A, B, and C (meaning options A, B, C are correct)

Option B: A and B (options A and B correct)

Option C: The U.S.S.R.

Option D: France

Option E: Brazil

Option F: Japan

Option G: Germany

Option H: The U.S.

Option I: India

Option J: China

Wait, perhaps the options are that each option is a possible set of correct countries. For example, option A says that the correct answer is A, B, and C, which would mean the first three options are correct, but that can't be because the options are letters, not the countries themselves.

This is getting a bit confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the question is a multiple-select, but the options are presented as A-J, each being a possible answer, which could be a single country or a combination.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option B, which says "A and B", but that would require knowing what A and B are. Alternatively, perhaps the options are not combinations but individual countries, and the question is which of the following have done it.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again: the question is, which of the following countries have sent landers to Venus. The options are individual countries (C, H, etc.), and combinations (A, B, etc.).

Since I know the U.S.S.R. and the U.S. have sent landers, I need to find an option that includes both. Looking at the options, perhaps option B is "A and B", but I don't know what A and B are. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, which is "A and B", but without knowing what A and B refer to, I'm stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, which is "A and B", but I don't have info on what A and B are. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that both the U.S.S.R. and the U.S. have done it, so the correct option would be the one that includes both.

Looking again, the options are:

A: A, B, and C

B: A and B

C: The U.S.S.R.

D: France

E: Brazil

F: Japan

G: Germany

H: The U.S.

I: India

J: China

Wait, perhaps the letters A-J are the possible answers, each being a country or a combination. So the correct answer would be the option that says both the U.S.S.R. and the U.S. have done it. So looking for an option that includes both C and H.

But I don't see such an option. So perhaps the intended answer is that both C and H are correct, but the options don't have a combination of C and H. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option B, which is "A and B", but I don't know what A and B are.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think of the possible correct answers. The Soviet Union (C) and the United States (H) have sent landers. So the correct answer would be an option that includes both. Let's see if any of the options do that.

Looking at option A: A, B, and C. But I don't know what A, B, and C are here. It can't be, because option C is the U.S.S.R.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are structured such that the correct answer is option B, which is "A and B", but without knowing what A and B are, I can't say.

Wait, perhaps the options are that each letter (A-J) represents a possible country or combination. So, for example, option C is the U.S.S.R., and option H is the U.S. So the correct answer would include both, but none of the options seem to do that. So perhaps the correct answer is that both C and H are correct, but the options don't have a choice that includes both. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is that the U.S.S.R. and the U.S. have done it, but looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is option B, which is "A and B", but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option B, which is "A and B". But since I don't know what A and B are, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the options are as follows: the question gives a list of options, each being a country or a combination. The correct answer is that both the U.S.S.R. and the U.S. have sent landers. So looking for an option that includes both.

Looking again, perhaps option B is "A and B", but I don't know. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C and H, but since each option is a single choice, perhaps the correct answer is option C and H, but the question expects one option letter.

Wait, perhaps the intended answer is option C (U.S.S.R.) and H (U.S.), but since the options are single letters, perhaps the correct answer is option B, which is "A and B", but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, which is "A and B", meaning that the correct countries are A and B, but I don't know what those are.

This is getting too confusing. Let me try a different approach. I know that the Soviet Union (option C) and the U.S. (option H) have sent landers. So if the options include both, the correct answer would be an option that includes both. But I don't see such an option. So perhaps the intended answer is option B, assuming that A and B are the U.S.S.R. and U.S., but without more info, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that only the Soviet Union has sent landers, but I know the U.S. has as well with the Pioneer Venus landers.

Wait, I'm certain that both the U.S.S.R. and the U.S. have sent landers to Venus. So the correct answer must include both. Looking at the options again, I don't see an option that includes both C and H. So perhaps the intended answer is that the correct options are C and H, but the question is multiple-choice, so perhaps the correct answer is option B, which is "A and B", but I'm not certain without knowing what A and B are.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, which is "A and B", meaning that the correct countries are A and B, but without knowing what A and B are, I can't confirm.

Wait, perhaps the options are structured such that option A is "The U.S.S.R. and the U.S.", but that's not how it's presented. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B, which is "A and B", and A is the U.S.S.R., B is the U.S., making option B the correct answer.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer is option B: A and B, assuming A is the U.S.S.R. and B is the U.S.

The question asks which of the following countries has sent landers to Venus. To determine the correct answer, we analyze the options provided:

- **Option C (The U.S.S.R.)**: The Soviet Union's Venera program successfully landed several probes on Venus, starting with Venera 7 in 1970. This confirms that the U.S.S.R. has sent landers to Venus.

- **Option H (The U.S.)**: The United States sent landers to Venus as part of the Pioneer Venus project, which included a multiprobe mission. This confirms that the U.S. has also sent landers to Venus.

Other options, such as Japan (F), France (D), Brazil (E), Germany (G), India (I), and China (J), do not have documented landers on Venus. Therefore, the correct answer must include both the U.S.S.R. (C) and the U.S. (H).

Given the structure of the options, **Option B (A and B)** is the correct choice, assuming "A" represents the U.S.S.R. and "B" represents the U.S.

Answer: B
