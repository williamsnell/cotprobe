Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the fractional increase in mass for a jetliner moving at 600 miles per hour. Hmm, right, fractional increase of mass—that sounds like it's related to special relativity. I remember that when objects move at speeds close to the speed of light, their mass increases. But wait, 600 mph isn't that fast compared to light speed, so the effect must be really small.

First, I think I need to use the formula for relativistic mass increase. The formula I recall is the Lorentz factor gamma, which is 1 divided by the square root of (1 minus v squared over c squared). So gamma equals 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Then the fractional increase would be gamma minus 1, right?

So the fractional increase Δm/m = gamma - 1.

Wait, but let me make sure. Mass increases by gamma times the rest mass, so the increase is (gamma - 1)*m. So yeah, that's correct.

Now, let's plug in the numbers. The speed v is 600 miles per hour. Oh wait, I need to convert that into meters per second because the speed of light c is in m/s. 

How do I convert miles per hour to meters per second? Let's see. I know that 1 mile is approximately 1609 meters, and 1 hour is 3600 seconds. So 600 miles per hour would be 600 * 1609 meters divided by 3600 seconds.

Calculating that: 600 * 1609 = let's see, 600 * 1600 is 960,000, and 600*9 is 5,400. So total is 965,400 meters per hour. Then divide by 3600 to get meters per second.

So 965,400 / 3600 = let's compute step by step. Dividing numerator and denominator by 100 gives 9654 / 36. 36 times 268 is 9648 (because 36*200=7200, 36*68=2448, total 9648). So 9654-9648=6, so 268 with a remainder of 6, which is 268 and 6/36 = 268.166... So about 268.1667 m/s.

Wait, let me double-check that. 600 mph * 1609.344 m/mile = 600 * 1609.344 = let me calculate that. 600 * 1600 is 960000, 600 *9.344 is 5,606.4. So total 965,606.4 meters per hour. Then divide by 3600 seconds: 965606.4 / 3600 ≈ let's see. 3600 * 268 = 964800. So 965606.4 - 964800 = 806.4. 806.4 /3600 = 0.224. So total is approximately 268.224 m/s.

Hmm, I think I remember that the speed of light c is about 3 x 10^8 m/s, so 268 m/s is way smaller than that. So v/c would be 268 / 3e8. Let me compute that. 3e8 is 300,000,000. So 268 / 3e8 = approx 8.933e-7.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. 268.224 / 3e8 = 268.224 / 300,000,000 = 0.000000894 (since 268.224 / 3 = 89.408, so 89.408e-9, which is 8.9408e-8). Wait, wait, wait. Wait, 3e8 is 3*10^8. So 268.224 / (3e8) = (268.224 /3) * 1e-8. 268.224 /3 is approx 89.408, so 89.408e-8, which is 8.9408e-7? Wait, no. Wait, 1e-8 times 89.408 would be 8.9408e-7? Or wait, 89.408 x 1e-8 = 0.00000089408, which is 8.9408e-7. Oh, right, because 1e-8 is 0.00000001, so 89.4e-8 is 0.000000894. So v/c is approximately 8.94e-7.

So then, v squared over c squared would be (8.94e-7)^2. Let me calculate that. 8.94 squared is about 80 (since 9^2 is 81), so 80e-14. So 8e-7 squared is 64e-14, 0.94 squared is about 0.9, so 8.94^2 is approximately 79. So 79e-14, which is 7.9e-13. So v²/c² ≈ 7.9e-13.

Now, the Lorentz factor gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²). Since v²/c² is so small, we can approximate gamma using a binomial expansion. The expansion for 1/sqrt(1 - x) when x is small is approximately 1 + x/2 + (3x²)/8 + ... So gamma ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2c²), because the higher terms are negligible.

So gamma ≈ 1 + (v²)/(2c²). Therefore, the fractional increase (gamma -1) is approximately (v²)/(2c²). So delta m/m ≈ (v²)/(2c²).

Substituting the value we found: (7.9e-13)/2 = 3.95e-13. Wait, but wait, let me double-check my calculation. Wait, v²/c² is 7.9e-13, so half of that is 3.95e-13. So the fractional increase is about 3.95e-13.

Wait, but looking at the options, they are all in the order of 1e-12. Hmm, 3.95e-13 is 0.395e-12, which would be 0.4e-12. But the options don't have that. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, let me go through the steps again. Maybe I messed up the conversion from mph to m/s.

Let me recalculate the speed in m/s. 600 miles per hour.

1 mile = 1609.344 meters. So 600 miles is 600 * 1609.344 = let's compute that.

600 * 1600 = 960,000. 600 * 9.344 = 600 *9=5400, 600 *0.344=206.4. So 5400 +206.4=5606.4. So total is 960,000 +5,606.4 = 965,606.4 meters per hour.

Now, to get meters per second, divide by 3600. So 965,606.4 /3600.

Compute 965606.4 / 3600:

Divide numerator and denominator by 100: 9656.064 /36 = ?

36 * 268 = 9648. So 268 *36=9648.

9656.064 -9648 = 8.064.

So 8.064/36 = 0.224. So total is 268.224 m/s.

So v is 268.224 m/s.

c is 3e8 m/s, so v/c = 268.224 / 3e8.

Compute that: 268.224 /3e8 = 268.224 / 300,000,000.

Divide numerator and denominator by 3: 89.408 / 100,000,000.

So 89.408e-9, which is 8.9408e-8.

Wait, no: 89.408 / 1e8 is 8.9408e-7.

Wait, 3e8 is 300,000,000. So 268.224 / 300,000,000 = 0.00000089408.

Which is 8.9408e-7.

So (v/c) is approximately 8.9408e-7.

Then (v/c)^2 is (8.9408e-7)^2 = let's compute that.

(8.9408)^2 = let's see, 8^2=64, 0.9408^2≈0.885, and cross terms 2*8*0.9408=15.09. So 64 + 15.09 + 0.885 ≈79.975. So (v/c)^2 ≈79.975e-14, which is 7.9975e-13.

So (v^2)/(c^2) ≈7.9975e-13.

Now, gamma is 1/sqrt(1 - x), where x=7.9975e-13. Since x is very small, we can approximate gamma as 1 + x/2.

So gamma ≈ 1 + (7.9975e-13)/2 = 1 + 3.99875e-13.

Thus, the fractional increase is (gamma -1) ≈3.99875e-13, which is approximately 4.0e-13.

Wait, but looking at the options, the closest is B: 0.8e-12, which is 8e-13. But that's bigger than 4e-13. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the approximation.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I should not approximate and calculate gamma exactly.

So gamma = 1 / sqrt(1 - x), where x is 7.9975e-13.

So let's compute sqrt(1 - x) ≈ 1 - x/2 - x²/8, but since x is very small, the square of x is negligible. So sqrt(1 -x) ≈ 1 - x/2.

Thus, gamma ≈ 1/(1 - x/2) ≈ (1 + x/2 + (x/2)^2 + ... ) using the expansion 1/(1 - a) ≈1 +a + a² + ... when a is small.

So gamma ≈ 1 + x/2 + (x²)/4 + higher terms.

So gamma -1 ≈ x/2 + x²/4.

But x is 8e-7, so x² is 6.4e-14, which is negligible compared to x/2, which is 4e-13. So the fractional increase is approximately 4e-13.

So 4e-13 is 0.4e-12, but none of the options are exactly that. Let's look at the options again.

Options:

A: 1.5e-12

B:0.8e-12

C:0.5e-12

D:0.3e-12

E:2.0e-12

F:4.5e-12

G:5.0e-12

H:2.5e-12

I:3.0e-12

J:1.0e-12

Hmm, so 0.4e-12 isn't present. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps when I computed (v/c), I messed up the calculation. Let me compute 268.224 m/s divided by 3e8 m/s.

So 268.224 / 3e8 = ?

3e8 is 300,000,000.

So 268.224 / 3e8 = (268.224 /3) * 1e-8.

268.224 divided by 3 is approximately 89.408.

So 89.408e-8 is 8.9408e-7. So yes, that's correct.

So (v/c)^2 is (8.9408e-7)^2 = 79.975e-14 = 7.9975e-13.

So fractional increase is (gamma - 1) = (7.9975e-13)/2 = 3.99875e-13, which is approximately 4.0e-13.

So that's 4.0e-13, which is 0.4e-12. But the options don't have that. The closest is option B, which is 0.8e-12, which is twice as much. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Oh wait, perhaps I forgot a factor somewhere. Let me think. The mass increase is gamma*m0 - m0 = m0*(gamma -1). So the fractional increase is (gamma -1) = (1/sqrt(1 - v²/c²) ) -1.

Wait, but in my earlier step, I used the approximation gamma ≈1 + (v²)/(2c²), so fractional increase is (v²)/(2c²). But perhaps I should use a more precise approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute gamma more accurately without approximation. Let's compute 1/sqrt(1 - x) where x is 7.9975e-13.

So 1 - x = 0.999999999920025 (since x is 7.9975e-13). The square root of that is approximately sqrt(1 - x) ≈1 - x/2 - x²/8. So sqrt(1 -x) ≈1 - x/2 - x²/8.

Thus, gamma = 1/(1 - x/2 - x²/8) ≈ [1 + (x/2 + x²/8) + (x/2)^2 + ... ].

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to compute gamma as 1 + (1/2)x + (3/8)x² + ... So up to the x squared term.

So gamma -1 ≈ (x/2) + (3x²/8).

We have x=7.9975e-13, so x/2 = 3.99875e-13.

x squared is (7.9975e-13)^2 = approx 6.39e-25.

So 3x²/8 = (3/8)*6.39e-25 ≈ 2.4e-25.

So gamma -1 ≈3.99875e-13 +2.4e-25 ≈ 3.99875e-13, since the second term is negligible.

So the fractional increase is approximately 4.0e-13, which is 4.0 × 10^-13.

But the options don't have 4.0e-13. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of v. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe I should calculate v more accurately. Let me compute 600 mph in m/s.

600 miles/hour.

1 mile = 1609.344 meters.

So 600 miles = 600 * 1609.344 = let's compute:

600 * 1600 = 960,000.

600 *9.344 = 5,606.4.

Total: 960,000 +5,606.4 = 965,606.4 meters per hour.

Convert to meters per second: 965,606.4 / 3600.

Compute 965606.4 / 3600.

Well, 3600 * 268 = 964,800.

So 965,606.4 - 964,800 = 806.4.

806.4 / 3600 = 0.224.

So total is 268.224 m/s. So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should compute gamma without approximation. Let's compute 1/sqrt(1 - x), where x=7.9975e-13.

So 1 - x = 1 - 7.9975e-13 = 0.999999999920025.

Compute the square root of that. Let me use a calculator approach.

The sqrt(1 - x) can be approximated as 1 - x/2 - x²/8, but perhaps I can compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the binomial expansion for sqrt(1 - x) = 1 - x/2 - (x²)/8 - (x^3)/16 - ... So including more terms.

But given that x is 8e-7, x squared is 6.4e-14, so x cubed is 5.12e-21, which is negligible.

So sqrt(1 -x) ≈1 - x/2 - x²/8.

So gamma = 1/(sqrt(1 -x)) ≈1 + x/2 + (3 x²)/8.

So gamma -1 ≈x/2 + 3 x²/8.

Substituting x=7.9975e-13:

x/2 = 3.99875e-13.

3x²/8 = 3*(7.9975e-13)^2 /8.

Compute (7.9975e-13)^2 = (approx 8e-13)^2=6.4e-25.

So 3*6.4e-25=1.92e-24, divided by 8 is 2.4e-25.

So gamma -1 = 3.99875e-13 + 2.4e-25 ≈3.99875e-13.

So that's about 4.0e-13.

Hmm, but the options don't have that. Wait, perhaps I made an error in the initial approach. Maybe using the relativistic formula for kinetic energy instead?

Wait, no. The question is about fractional increase in mass. So it's definitely (gamma -1).

Wait, perhaps I should re-express the problem in terms of velocity as a fraction of the speed of light. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, another approach: Let's compute v = 268.224 m/s.

c = 3e8 m/s.

So (v/c) = 268.224 /3e8.

Compute 268.224 /3 = approx 89.408.

So v/c =89.408e-9 =8.9408e-8.

Wait, wait, 89.408e-9 is 8.9408e-8, correct.

So (v/c)^2 = (8.9408e-8)^2 = (8.9408)^2 * 1e-16.

8.9408 squared is approx 79.975.

So (v/c)^2 =79.975e-16 =7.9975e-15.

Wait wait, wait! Oh no! I think I made a mistake here. Because (8.9408e-8)^2 is
