Okay, so I have this problem about heat transfer in a tube, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me go through it step by step.

The air enters a tube with a diameter of 5.08 cm, which is 2 inches. The initial conditions are 1 atm and 150°C. It's moving at a velocity of 8 m/s. The question is about the heat transfer per unit length, but more specifically, the bulk temperature rise after a 2m pipe. The wall temperature is 20°C above the air's temperature everywhere, and the heat flux is constant.

Hmm, so I think this is a forced convection problem. Since the heat flux is constant, it's probably a case of constant heat flux boundary condition. I remember that in such cases, the heat transfer coefficient and other properties come into play.

First, I should find the properties of air at the initial temperature. Air at 150°C... I think the properties would be evaluated at that temperature. Let me recall the values. The specific heat of air at constant pressure (Cp) is around 1005 J/kg·K. The thermal conductivity (k) is probably about 0.03 W/m·K, and the dynamic viscosity (μ) might be around 2.07e-5 kg/m·s. The density (ρ) of air at 1 atm and 150°C... Let me think. At standard conditions (20°C), density is about 1.204 kg/m³, but at higher temperatures, gases expand. Using the ideal gas law, PV = nRT. Since pressure is constant, density is inversely proportional to temperature. So, at 150°C (which is 423 K), compared to 293 K (20°C), the density would be (293/423) * 1.204 ≈ 0.84 kg/m³? I'm not sure, maybe I should just look up the value. Wait, maybe I shouldn't, but for the sake of this problem, let's say ρ ≈ 0.84 kg/m³.

Next, I need to calculate the Reynolds number to determine if the flow is laminar or turbulent. Reynolds number Re = (ρ * v * D) / μ. Let's plug in the numbers. D is 0.0508 m, velocity v is 8 m/s.

Re = (0.84 kg/m³ * 8 m/s * 0.0508 m) / (2.07e-5 kg/m·s). Let's compute that: numerator is 0.84 *8=6.72, 6.72 *0.0508 ≈ 0.341. Denominator is 2.07e-5. So Re ≈ 0.341 / 2.07e-5 ≈ 16480. That's above 4000, so the flow is turbulent.

For turbulent flow in a tube with constant heat flux, the Nusselt number (Nu) can be found using the Dittus-Boelter equation: Nu = 0.023 Re^0.8 Pr^0.4. I think the Prandtl number (Pr) for air at around 150°C is about 0.688. Let me check that. Wait, I'm not entirely sure, but for air, Pr is roughly around 0.7. Yes, so Pr ≈ 0.688.

So plugging into the equation: Re is about 16480, so Re^0.8 is (1.648e4)^0.8. Let me compute that. Let's take log: log10(1.648e4) = 4.216. Multiply by 0.8: 3.373. So 10^3.373 ≈ 2363. So Re^0.8 ≈ 2363. Then Pr^0.4: 0.688^0.4. Let's think, 0.688 is about 0.7, and 0.7^0.4 is approximately 0.7^0.4. Let me compute ln(0.7) = -0.3567, multiply by 0.4: -0.1427. Exponentiate: e^-0.1427 ≈ 0.868. So 0.688^0.4 ≈ 0.868.

So Nu ≈ 0.023 * 2363 * 0.868. Let's compute that. 0.023 *2363 ≈ 54.3, then 54.3 *0.868 ≈ 47.1. So Nu is approximately 47.

Nu is also h * D / k, so h = Nu * k / D. k for air is about 0.03 W/m·K. So h = 47 * 0.03 / 0.0508. Let's compute that: 47 *0.03 = 1.41, 1.41 / 0.0508 ≈ 27.77 W/m²·K. So the heat transfer coefficient h is about 27.77 W/m²·K.

Now, the heat flux (q'') is given as constant. Wait, no, the problem says constant heat flux exists at the wall. So q'' is uniform. So the heat transfer per unit length is q' = q'' * π D L. Wait, but the question also asks for the heat transfer per unit length, but the main question is about the bulk temperature rise through a 2m length.

Wait, the main question is about the bulk temperature rise, so I need to find ΔT for a 2m pipe.

In a pipe with constant heat flux, the bulk temperature increases linearly along the pipe. The heat added per unit length (q'') times the length L will give the heat added, which is also equal to the mass flow rate times the specific heat times the temperature change.

So, the equation is: q' = (mass flow rate) * Cp * ΔT.

Wait, more precisely, q' = m_dot * Cp * (T_bulk_out - T_bulk_in) = m_dot Cp ΔT.

So I need to find m_dot, the mass flow rate.

m_dot is ρ * A * v. A is the cross-sectional area of the pipe. A = π D² /4. D is 0.0508 m. So A = π * (0.0508)^2 /4 ≈ π * 0.002582 /4 ≈ 0.00203 m².

m_dot = ρ * A * v = 0.84 kg/m³ * 0.00203 m² * 8 m/s. Let's compute that: 0.84 *0.00203 ≈ 0.0017, 0.0017 *8 ≈ 0.0136 kg/s.

Wait, double-checking: 0.84 * 0.00203 is 0.84 * 0.002 = 0.00168, plus 0.84 * 0.00003 = 0.0000252, total about 0.001705. Multiply by 8: 0.01364 kg/s, yes.

Now, the heat transfer per unit length (q') is the heat flux times the perimeter. Since it's a constant heat flux, q'' is the same everywhere. But wait, the problem states that the wall temperature is everywhere 20°C above the air temperature. Wait, that's a bit confusing. Because the bulk temperature is increasing along the pipe, so the wall temperature is also increasing, but always 20°C above the local bulk temperature.

Wait, but in that case, the temperature difference isn't constant; it's the same everywhere? Because T_wall = T_bulk + 20. Hmm, so maybe the heat flux isn't constant? Or wait, the problem says a constant heat flux exists. So q'' is uniform along the pipe.

Wait, but if T_wall is always 20°C above the bulk, which is rising, then the heat flux would change because q'' = h (T_wall - T_bulk). But if q'' is constant, then T_wall - T_bulk must be constant. So that implies that T_wall - T_bulk is fixed, which is 20°C. So the wall is always 20°C higher than the local bulk temperature. Therefore, the heat flux q'' would be h * 20. So in this scenario, the heat flux is uniform because the temperature difference is fixed.

Wait, but that's conflicting with the earlier statement that the heat flux is constant. So perhaps I should model it as q'' = h (T_wall - T_bulk), and since T_wall - T_bulk = 20, then q'' = 20 h.

Wait, but earlier I thought that q'' is uniform, which would be the case here because T_wall - T_bulk is uniform. So q'' = h (T_wall - T_bulk) = h * 20. So that's the heat flux.

So q'' = h * 20 = 27.77 W/m²·K * 20°C = 555.4 W/m².

Wait, but wait, no—wait, the units. h is in W/m²·K, and 20 is K (since it's a temperature difference). So q'' is 27.77 * 20 = 555.4 W/m².

So the heat flux is 555.4 W/m².

Now, the heat transfer per unit length (q' per meter) is q'' multiplied by the perimeter. The perimeter of the tube is π D. So q' = q'' * π D.

So q' = 555.4 W/m² * π * 0.0508 m. Let's compute that: π * 0.0508 ≈ 0.159 m. So 555.4 * 0.159 ≈ 88.4 W/m.

So per meter, 88.4 W of heat is added.

Now, the total heat added for a 2m pipe is q = 88.4 W/m * 2m = 176.8 W.

Now, the mass flow rate m_dot is 0.01364 kg/s. The specific heat Cp is 1005 J/kg·K.

So the temperature rise ΔT is q/(m_dot * Cp) = 176.8 J/s / (0.01364 kg/s * 1005 J/kg·K).

Let me calculate the denominator: 0.01364 * 1005 ≈ 13.71. So 176.8 /13.71 ≈ 12.9 °C.

Wait, but wait, looking at the options, the closest is option G:12.3, option C:15.8, etc. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Let me go back and check my steps.

First, I calculated Re as 16480, which is turbulent. Then used Dittus-Boelter to find Nu.

Wait, another thought: Dittus-Boelter is for steady, turbulent flow, which is correct here. But what about the Prandtl number? Maybe I should have used a more precise value.

Wait, at 150°C, the Pr of air is about 0.688, which I used. So that part seems okay.

Let me recheck the calculation of h:

h = (Nu * k) / D = (47 * 0.03) / 0.0508.

47 *0.03 is 1.41. 1.41 /0.0508 = approx 27.77. That seems right.

Then q'' = h * (T_wall - T_bulk) = 27.77 * 20 = 555.4 W/m². Correct.

Then q' per unit length: 555.4 * π * 0.0508. Let me compute that more accurately.

0.0508 * π ≈ 0.15915 m. So 555.4 * 0.15915 ≈ 555 * 0.159 is approx 555*0.16 is 88.8, but 0.159 is slightly less. So about 88.4 W/m. Correct.

Total q for 2m: 88.4 *2 = 176.8 W.

Mass flow rate: m_dot = rho * A * v.

A is pi*(D/2)^2. D=0.0508 m, so radius 0.0254 m.

A = pi * (0.0254)^2 = pi * 0.00064516 ≈ 0.002027 m².

So m_dot = 0.84 kg/m³ * 0.002027 m² * 8 m/s.

0.84 *0.002027 ≈ 0.001701 kg/m³·m²? Wait, kg/(m³) * m² * m/s = kg/s.

0.84 * 0.002027 = 0.001701. 0.001701 *8 = 0.013608 kg/s. So m_dot = 0.013608 kg/s.

Cp is 1005 J/kg·K.

So Q = m_dot * Cp * ΔT.

So ΔT = Q/(m_dot * Cp) = 176.8 / (0.013608 * 1005).

Calculate denominator: 0.013608 *1005 ≈ 13.67 (since 0.0136 *1000=13.6, plus 0.0136*5=0.068, total 13.668).

So 176.8 /13.668 ≈ 12.95°C.

Hmm, that's approximately 13°C. The options don't have exactly that. Let me look again at the options.

Options:

A:16.9, B:18.2, C:15.8, D:13.4, E:8.6, F:11.1, G:12.3, H:9.7, I:14.6, J:10.2.

So 13.4 is option D, and 12.3 is G. My calculation is around 12.95°C, which is close to 13.4, but perhaps I made an error in some calculation.

Wait, perhaps the way I calculated the heat transfer is incorrect. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should use the bulk mean temperature.

Wait, another approach: The heat transfer in a pipe with constant heat flux can be modeled using the following relation for temperature rise.

The bulk temperature rise ΔT is given by (q'' * π D L) / (m_dot Cp).

Wait, but that's what I did. So perhaps a miscalculation in Re or Nu?

Let me recalculate Re.

Re = (rho * v * D) / mu.

rho = 0.84 kg/m³.

v=8 m/s.

D=0.0508 m.

mu at 150°C is about 2.07e-5 kg/m·s.

So Re = (0.84 * 8 * 0.0508) / (2.07e-5).

Compute numerator: 0.84 *8=6.72, 6.72 *0.0508=0.341.

So 0.341 / 2.07e-5 = 16480. That's correct.

So Nu = 0.023 * Re^0.8 * Pr^0.4.

Re^0.8: 16480^0.8.

Let me compute 16480^0.8 more accurately. Take natural logs.

ln(16480) = ln(1.648e4) = ln(1.648) + ln(1e4) + ln(10^0) ?

Wait, 16480 =1.648 *10^4.

ln(1.648)=0.499, ln(1e4)=9.2103. So ln(16480)=0.499 + 9.2103=9.7093.

Multiply by 0.8: 9.7093 *0.8=7.7674.

Exponentiate: e^7.7674.

e^7 is about 1096, e^0.7674 ≈ 2.154. So e^7.7674 ≈ 1096 *2.154≈ 2363. So Re^0.8=2363, correct.

Pr=0.688, Pr^0.4= e^(0.4 * ln(0.688)).

ln(0.688)= -0.373.

0.4 * (-0.373)= -0.1492.

e^-0.1492≈0.862.

So Pr^0.4≈0.862.

So Nu=0.023 *2363 *0.862.

Compute 2363 *0.862: 2363 *0.8=1890.4, 2363 *0.062≈146.5. Total≈2036.9.

Then 0.023 *2036.9≈46.85, so Nu≈46.85.

h = Nu *k / D =46.85 *0.03 /0.0508.

46.85 *0.03=1.4055.

1.4055 /0.0508≈27.66 W/m²·K.

So h≈27.66.

Then q''=h*(Tw - Tb)=27.66*(20)=553.2 W/m².

Perimeter is pi*D= 0.15915 m.

So q' per unit length:553.2 *0.15915≈553 *0.16=88.48, precise value 553.2*0.15915= let's compute: 553.2 *0.1=55.32, 553.2 *0.05=27.66, 553.2 *0.00915≈5.06. Sum:55.32 +27.66=82.98 +5.06=88.04 W/m.

So q' per m is 88.04 W/m.

For 2m, q= 88.04 *2=176.08 W.

m_dot= rho * A *v =0.84 *0.002027 *8=0.0136 kg/s.

Cp=1005 J/kg·K.

ΔT= q/(m_dot Cp)=176.08/(0.0136 *1005)=176.08/(13.608)= approximately 12.94°C.

Wait, so about 12.94°C, which is closer to 13°C. The options have D as 13.4 and G as 12.3.

Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the air properties.

Wait, maybe I should use the properties of air at the average bulk temperature. Because the initial temperature is 150°C, and it's heating up. So maybe the properties should be evaluated at a higher temperature.

Wait, but the method I used assumes that the properties are taken at the initial temperature. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the bulk mean temperature, but that would complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the initial assumption of the air properties is incorrect
