Okay, so I've got this problem here about Frank Bryant's compensation, and I need to figure out how much he's owed for the month. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, I'll read the problem again to make sure I understand all the details. Frank is a salesman for a refrigerator company. He gets all his travel expenses compensated, and he has a drawing account of $600 per month. His commission structure is a bit tiered: 2% on the first $30k, 2.5% on the next $10k, and 3% on anything over $40k. 

So for this particular month, his travel expenses were $332.75, he drew $600, and his sales were $41,180. I need to calculate the amount due to him.

Hmm, okay, let's structure this. I think the approach is to calculate his total commission from sales, then add the drawing, and then subtract any expenses he might have. Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, the way it's worded is that he's compensated for all travel expenses, so I think that means he gets the $332.75 back. But the drawing account is a bit different. I think a drawing account is like an advance he gets each month, but maybe he has to pay it back from his commissions? Or maybe the drawing is part of his earnings. I'm a bit confused about that.

Wait, let me think. Drawing accounts are often used in businesses where the owner takes money out for personal use. In sales, sometimes salespeople have a drawing account which is like an advance against their future commissions. So, in this case, Frank is allowed a drawing of $600 per month. So perhaps that $600 is his to take each month, regardless of his sales. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the $600 is an expense, but that doesn't seem right because it's called a drawing account. So perhaps he's entitled to $600 each month, and then his commissions are added on top, and then his expenses are subtracted. Or maybe the drawing is something else entirely.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this by looking at the components. The amount due him would come from his commissions, plus any reimbursements for expenses, minus any amounts he's taken as a drawing. Or maybe the drawing is part of his pay, and the commissions are on top, and then the expenses are added back. I'm a bit confused here. Let me try to outline the steps.

First, calculate his commission. His sales are $41,180, which is over $40k. So, the commission structure is as follows:

- 2% on the first $30,000.
- 2.5% on the next $10,000 (so up to $40k).
- 3% on anything over $40k.

So, he's sold $41,180, which is $1,180 over $40k.

So the commission would be:

First tier: 2% of $30,000 → 0.02 * 30,000 = $600.

Second tier: 2.5% of $10,000 → 0.025 * 10,000 = $250.

Third tier: 3% of $1,180 → 0.03 * 1,180 = let's calculate that. 1% of 1,180 is 11.8, so 3% is 35.4.

So total commission is 600 + 250 + 35.4 = 885.4.

So $885.40 in commission.

Next, he has a drawing account of $600. I'm not entirely sure, but I think the drawing account is an amount he's allowed to take each month, so perhaps that's added to his pay. So the drawing would be $600.

Wait, but sometimes a drawing account is an advance, so if he's already taken the $600, then perhaps that's subtracted from his commissions. But the problem says he "is allowed a drawing account of $600 per month." So maybe he can draw $600 each month, which would be in addition to his commissions. Or perhaps the $600 is subtracted from his commissions and given to him as a draw. Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again.

The problem states: "He receives a monthly commission of ... and is allowed a drawing account of $600 per month." So perhaps the $600 is in addition to his commission. So his total earnings would be commission plus drawing, minus any expenses. Or wait, maybe the drawing is part of his pay, so he gets the $600 as a draw each month, and then his commissions are added on top, and then his expenses are reimbursed.

Wait, but in this case, the problem says his travel expenses are $332.75. So he paid that out of pocket, and since he's compensated for all travel expenses, that amount should be added to his earnings.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is:

Total amount due = Commission + Drawing + Travel Expenses.

But that doesn't sound right. Wait, because the drawing is an account, perhaps it's a payment he receives each month, and then the commission is on top of that, and then the expenses are separate.

Alternatively, maybe the drawing is part of his pay, so he gets the $600, and then the commission is calculated based on sales. Then, the expenses are added back because he's reimbursed for them.

Wait, perhaps the correct calculation is:

Total amount due = (Commission) + (Drawing) + (Travel Expenses).

Wait, but that seems off because the drawing is a separate allowance, and the commission is based on sales. Plus, the travel expenses are being reimbursed, so perhaps they're added.

Wait, let me think of it as:

Frank's total pay for the month would be:

- His commission from sales: $885.40.

- Plus his drawing account: $600.

- Plus any travel expenses he paid out of pocket, which are reimbursed: $332.75.

Wait, but that would make the total 885.40 + 600 + 332.75 = 1,818.15. But that's not one of the options. So I must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps the drawing account is a payment he receives each month in addition to his commission, and then the travel expenses are also added. But maybe that's not the case. Alternatively, perhaps the drawing is an advance against his commission, so he gets the $600 each month, and then his commission is calculated, and then the drawing is subtracted. But that depends on how the company operates.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is:

Commission is calculated as $885.40.

Then, from that, his drawing of $600 is subtracted, because it's an advance. So his earnings from commission would be 885.40 - 600 = 285.40.

Then, he gets reimbursed for his travel expenses, which are $332.75.

So total amount due would be 285.40 (commission after drawing) + 332.75 (reimbursement) = 618.15.

Looking at the options, I see option D is $618.15. But I'm not sure if that's correct because I might have misunderstood how the drawing account works.

Alternatively, perhaps the drawing is just an addition. Wait, let me think again. Maybe the drawing is part of his pay each month, so he gets $600, plus his commission, plus any expenses. But that would lead to a higher number than any of the options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the problem again. It says he's allowed a drawing account of $600 per month. So perhaps that's in addition to his commission, and then the expenses are added as reimbursement.

So total would be 885.40 (commission) + 600 (drawing) + 332.75 (expenses) = 1,818.15, but that's not an option. So maybe that's not right.

Wait, perhaps the drawing is an advance, so he's already taken the $600, and the commission is what's left after that. So the commission is $885.40, and then the $600 is subtracted, leaving $285.40. Then, he gets his expenses back, so $285.40 + $332.75 = $618.15. So that would be option D.

But wait, another approach: perhaps the drawing is added to his commission, and then the expenses are subtracted. No, that doesn't make sense because expenses are paid out of pocket and should be reimbursed. So he should get that money back.

Alternatively, perhaps the drawing is not part of his commission, but a separate payment, so his total due is commission plus drawing plus expenses.

Wait, let me consider the possible options. Let's recalculate the commission: 2% on 30k is 600; 2.5% on next 10k is 250; 3% on 1,180 is 35.40. So total commission is 600+250=850 +35.40=885.40.

Then, he gets a drawing of 600. So that's 885.40 + 600 = 1,485.40.

Then, he has travel expenses of 332.75 that are reimbursed. So add that: 1,485.40 + 332.75 = 1,818.15. But that's not one of the options. So that can't be right.

Alternatively, perhaps the drawing is subtracted from the commission. So 885.40 - 600 = 285.40. Then, add the expenses: 285.40 + 332.75 = 618.15. So that's option D.

Wait, but why would the drawing be subtracted? Because it's an advance against commission. So he's already taken the $600, so when his commission is calculated, the $600 is subtracted, and then any expenses are added back. That makes sense. Because the drawing is an advance, so it's like a loan against future commissions. So when he earns the commission, the $600 is subtracted, and then he gets reimbursed for his expenses.

So in this case, commission is $885.40. Subtract drawing of $600: 885.40 - 600 = 285.40. Then add the expenses: 285.40 + 332.75 = 618.15. So that would be option D.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another way to think about it is: the amount due him is his total commission plus any expenses, minus any amounts he has drawn. So 885.40 + 332.75 = 1,218.15; then subtract the drawing of 600, giving 618.15. So same result.

So that would make the answer D: $618.15.

Looking at the options, D is $618.15. So I think that's the correct answer.

To determine the amount due Frank Bryant for the month, we need to calculate his total compensation based on the given details. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Commission Calculation**:  
   Frank's sales total $41,180, and the commission structure is tiered:  
   - 2% on the first $30,000:  
     \( 0.02 \times 30,000 = 600 \)  
   - 2.5% on the next $10,000:  
     \( 0.025 \times 10,000 = 250 \)  
   - 3% on the remaining $1,180 (since $41,180 - $40,000 = $1,180):  
     \( 0.03 \times 1,180 = 35.40 \)  
   Total commission:  
   \( 600 + 250 + 35.40 = 885.40 \).

2. **Drawing Account**:  
   Frank is allowed a drawing account of $600 per month. This is typically treated as an advance against future commissions, meaning it is subtracted from the total commission.

3. **Travel Expenses**:  
   Frank paid $332.75 in travel expenses out of pocket, and he is reimbursed for these expenses.

4. **Final Calculation**:  
   - Subtract the drawing account from the total commission:  
     \( 885.40 - 600 = 285.40 \).  
   - Add the reimbursed travel expenses:  
     \( 285.40 + 332.75 = 618.15 \).

Thus, the total amount due Frank Bryant for the month is **$618.15**.

**Answer: D**
