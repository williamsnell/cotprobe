Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how an unconditional branch instruction is specified in an APL program. I remember APL uses various symbols for different operations, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the specifics. Let me think this through.

First, I know that in programming, branching instructions are used to jump to different parts of the code. Conditional branches depend on some condition, while unconditional branches happen regardless of conditions.

In APL, I recall that there are specific symbols for control structures. The question is about unconditional branches, so I need to remember which symbol represents that.

I think the branch symbol in APL is the right-pointing arrow, which is like an arrow pointing to the right. So the instruction would involve that arrow followed by a target, which could be a line number or a label. Wait, but labels might be more common in other languages. I'm not sure if APL uses labels much, but the option might still include that.

Looking at the options, option E is a right pointing arrow followed by a number or label. That fits with what I'm thinking. But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes the symbols could be mixed up. Let me think again.

Another possibility is the caret (^) symbol. I remember that in some contexts, ^ is used for exponentiation, but maybe it's used for something else in APL. But wait, I think the branch is indeed the right arrow. Because in APL, the right arrow is used for go to, like →. So the syntax would be → followed by the line number or label.

So the correct option should be E. Let me double-check the options. Option E says a right pointing arrow followed by a number or a label. Yes, that's exactly what I was thinking.

Wait, but I also remember that in APL, the branch could be written with a caret (^) as well. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up. No, I think the right arrow is for go to. Let me think of an example. In APL, you might write something like:

→STOP

or 

→5

So yes, that's the right arrow. So option E is correct.

The unconditional branch instruction in an APL program is specified using a right-pointing arrow (→) followed by a number or a label. This symbol indicates a jump to a different part of the code without any conditions. Among the options provided, the correct one is:

E: A right pointing arrow followed by a number or a label.

Answer: E
