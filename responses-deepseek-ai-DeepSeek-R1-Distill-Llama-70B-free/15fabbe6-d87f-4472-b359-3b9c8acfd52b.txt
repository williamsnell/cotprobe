Question:

A developer recently acquired a large vacant lot and wished to build a series of 10 tract homes on the lot to offer for sale. On May 1, he telephoned a number of contractors whom he had dealt with in the past and asked them to submit bids to build the homes. One of the contractors in turn sought bids from several subcontractors to determine the overall cost of the job. He notified each subcontractor that he intended to use their bids in submitting a general bid to the developer. A plumber submitted a bid to the contractor in the amount of $50,000, which the contractor used in computing the bid he sent to the developer. On June 1, the contractor submitted a bid to the developer in which he offered to build the 10 tract homes for $500,000. On June 4, the plumber notified the contractor that he had overbooked his crews and could not possibly do the work on the developer's job. On June 5, the developer sent the contractor a signed confirmation letter wherein he stated, "I hereby accept your offer to build the 10 tract homes for $500,000. ', Thereafter, the contractor hired another plumber to complete the plumbing work at a cost of $60,000. The contractor then explained the situation to the developer and requested that the overall cost of the job be increased to $510,000. The developer refused on the grounds that he had a contract for $500,000 and that this was the contractor's problem. The contractor then built the 10 tract homes, and the developer sent him a check for $500,000. Which of the following best supports a claim for $10,000 by the contractor against the plumber who refused to do the work?

Options:

A: The plumber's bid created an enforceable promissory estoppel situation.
B: An option contract was created, because the contractor, with the plumber's knowledge, used the plumber's bid in computing the bid he submitted to the developer.
C: The plumber had an implied contract with the contractor, which he violated by refusing to fulfill his bid.
D: The plumber had a moral obligation to fulfill his bid as it was already included in the contractor's total cost.
E: The contractor relied on the plumber's bid in good faith, creating an enforceable contract.
F: The plumber made an offer that the contractor accepted by using the plumber's bid in computing the bid he submitted to the developer.
G: The plumber's bid was a binding contract, which the plumber breached by refusing to do the work.
H: The contractor made an offer to the plumber that the plumber accepted when he submitted his bid.
I: The plumber's bid was a "firm offer" that was not revocable, since both the plumber and the contractor were merchants.
J: The plumber's bid constituted a unilateral contract which the contractor accepted by submitting his bid to the developer.

Okay, so I have this question about contract law, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read through it carefully.

Alright, the situation is that a developer wants to build 10 tract homes. He contacts contractors, and one of them gets bids from subcontractors, including a plumber. The plumber bids $50k. The contractor uses that bid in his own bid to the developer for $500k. Then the developer accepts the contractor's bid. But the plumber later backs out, saying he's overbooked, and the contractor has to hire another plumber for $60k. Now the contractor is trying to get the developer to pay an extra $10k, but the developer refuses. So the contractor is suing the plumber for the $10k difference.

The question is which option best supports the contractor's claim against the plumber.

Let me think about contract law principles here. The main issue is whether there was a binding contract between the contractor and the plumber, or some other legal obligation that the plumber breached.

First, let's recall that when someone asks for bids, those bids are usually considered offers. But in business contexts, sometimes these can be considered firm offers, especially between merchants under the UCC. So under the UCC, a merchant's offer in a signed writing can't be revoked for a certain period, even without consideration. This is to allow the offeree to rely on it.

In this case, the plumber is a subcontractor, so likely a merchant. The contractor told the subcontractors that he'd use their bids in his general bid. So the plumber knew his bid would be part of the contractor's offer to the developer.

Now, the plumber's bid was $50k. The contractor used it in his bid, which the developer accepted. Then the plumber tried to back out, but by that point, the contractor had already relied on the bid by submitting it to the developer and getting a contract.

So the question is whether the plumber's bid was a firm offer that the contractor could rely on. If it's a firm offer, then the plumber can't revoke it once the contractor has relied on it by submitting the bid.

Looking at the options:

Option I says the plumber's bid was a "firm offer" that was not revocable since both are merchants. That sounds right because under UCC ยง 2-205, a firm offer can be made by a merchant in a signed writing, and it's irrevocable for the time stated or, if not stated, for a reasonable time. Here, the plumber gave a bid (an offer) which the contractor used. So the plumber can't revoke it once the contractor relied on it by incorporating it into his own bid.

Wait, but the question is about the legal theory. The contractor is suing the plumber for the extra $10k. So the contractor would need to show that the plumber is liable for breach of contract or promissory estoppel.

If the plumber's bid was a firm offer, then when the contractor used it in his bid, perhaps that constitutes acceptance. Or maybe the reliance makes it enforceable under promissory estoppel even without a formal contract.

Option A says promissory estoppel. So if the plumber made an offer, the contractor relied on it to their detriment (by submitting a bid based on it), then even if there's no contract, the plumber can be estopped from revoking the offer. But I think firm offer is a better fit because it directly addresses the irrevocability.

Alternatively, option B: an option contract was created because the contractor used the plumber's bid with his knowledge. An option requires consideration, unless it's under the UCC's firm offer rules. So maybe option I is better because it's about a firm offer, which doesn't require consideration.

Option F: the plumber made an offer that the contractor accepted by using the bid. But usually, using the bid in computing the general bid isn't acceptance; it's more like reliance. So acceptance would require some communication, perhaps. So F might not be correct.

Option G says the plumber's bid was a binding contract, which he breached. But for a contract, you need offer, acceptance, consideration. If the contractor didn't accept the bid yet, maybe there's no contract. Unless the use of the bid in the general bid counts as acceptance. But I'm not sure about that. It could be that the contractor's act of using the bid is not an acceptance but rather an indication that he's considering it. So maybe G is incorrect.

Option E: the contractor relied in good faith, creating a contract. That sounds more like promissory estoppel again, but not necessarily a contract.

So the main options are A (promissory estoppel), I (firm offer under UCC), F (acceptance by use), and B (option contract).

Wait, I think option I is the strongest. Because under UCC ยง 2-205, a merchant's firm offer is irrevocable without consideration for a reasonable time. The plumber, being a merchant, made the offer which the contractor relied on when submitting his bid. So the plumber can't revoke his offer once the contractor has relied on it. Therefore, the plumber is bound, and the contractor can recover the difference as damages for breach.

So in this scenario, the best support is that the plumber's bid was a firm offer that couldn't be revoked. So option I is correct.

Wait, but let me think again. The firm offer under UCC 2-205 lasts for the time stated or, if not stated, a reasonable time. The plumber gave a bid on May 1, the contractor used it in his bid on June 1, and the developer accepted on June 5. The plumber tried to revoke on June 4. So the firm offer would still be in effect when the contractor used it. So the plumber couldn't revoke after the contractor relied on it.

So yes, option I is the best answer.

The question revolves around whether the plumber's bid to the contractor created a legally enforceable obligation, allowing the contractor to recover the $10,000 difference when the plumber refused to perform. The key issue is whether the plumber's bid constituted a firm offer under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) or another legal theory that binds the plumber to the bid.

Under UCC ยง 2-205, a merchant's offer can be made irrevocable for a specified time or, if unspecified, for a reasonable time. This is known as a "firm offer." Since the plumber is likely a merchant and provided a bid with the knowledge that it would be used in the contractor's bid to the developer, the plumber's bid qualifies as a firm offer. The contractor relied on this bid by incorporating it into his own bid to the developer, which was subsequently accepted. Once the contractor relied on the bid, the plumber could no longer revoke it without being in breach of the firm offer.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A (Promissory estoppel):** While reliance on the plumber's bid could support a promissory estoppel claim, the firm offer doctrine provides a stronger and more direct basis for liability under the UCC.
- **Option B (Option contract):** An option contract typically requires consideration, which is not clearly present here. The firm offer under UCC ยง 2-205 is a better fit.
- **Option F (Acceptance by use):** The contractor's use of the bid in submitting his own bid does not constitute traditional acceptance but rather reliance, which is addressed under the firm offer doctrine.
- **Option G (Binding contract):** A binding contract would require mutual assent, which is not clearly established here. The firm offer doctrine is more applicable.
- **Option I (Firm offer):** This is the strongest option, as the plumber's bid meets the criteria for a firm offer under UCC ยง 2-205, and the contractor's reliance on it makes it irrevocable.

The plumber's bid was a firm offer that became irrevocable when the contractor relied on it by submitting his bid to the developer. The plumber's subsequent refusal to perform constitutes a breach of this firm offer, supporting the contractor's claim for the $10,000 difference.
