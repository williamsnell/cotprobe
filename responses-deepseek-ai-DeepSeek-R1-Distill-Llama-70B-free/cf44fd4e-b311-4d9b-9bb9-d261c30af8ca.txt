Question:

If output of goods and services in real terms was $1600 billion last year, the money supply was $500 billion and the velocity of money was 4, then what was the price level? Was last year an inflationary period or a deflationary period?

Options:

A: 1.25, Not enough information
B: 0.8, Inflationary period
C: 2.5, Inflationary period
D: 2, It was a period of stable prices
E: 1.6, Deflationary period
F: 3, Deflationary period
G: 1.5, Not enough information
H: 1.25, Inflationary period
I: 2, Not enough information
J: 1, Not enough information

Okay, so I have this economics question here about the price level and whether it was an inflationary or deflationary period. Hmm, let's see, I need to figure this out step by step.

The question gives me some numbers: the output of goods and services in real terms is $1600 billion last year. The money supply is $500 billion, and the velocity of money is 4. I need to find the price level and determine if it's inflationary or deflationary.

Wait, I remember there's an equation that relates these variables. Oh right, the equation is M * V = P * Y, where M is the money supply, V is velocity, P is the price level, and Y is real output. So I can rearrange this to solve for P.

So plugging in the numbers, M is 500, V is 4. Y is 1600. So 500 * 4 equals P times 1600. Let me calculate that: 500 times 4 is 2000. So 2000 equals P times 1600. To find P, I divide both sides by 1600. So P is 2000 / 1600. Let me compute that: 2000 divided by 1600 is the same as 2 divided by 1.6, which is 1.25. So the price level is 1.25.

Wait, but what's the second part about whether it's inflationary or deflationary? Oh, right, that depends on whether the price level is rising or falling. But wait, the question only gives me data for last year. It doesn't tell me what happened this year or the previous year. So I can't compare it to see if prices are going up or down. So I don't have enough information to determine if it's inflationary or deflationary. 

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: 1.25, Not enough info. That matches what I found.

Other options either have a different price level or make a claim about inflation/deflation without justification. So the correct answer must be A.

To determine the price level and whether it was an inflationary or deflationary period, we use the equation:

\[
M \cdot V = P \cdot Y
\]

Where:
- \( M = \$500 \) billion (money supply),
- \( V = 4 \) (velocity of money),
- \( Y = \$1600 \) billion (real output),
- \( P \) is the price level.

Rearranging for \( P \):

\[
P = \frac{M \cdot V}{Y} = \frac{500 \cdot 4}{1600} = \frac{2000}{1600} = 1.25
\]

Thus, the price level is **1.25**.

To determine if it was an inflationary or deflationary period, we would need information about whether the price level is rising or falling over time. However, the question only provides data for last year, so we cannot compare it to previous years. Therefore, **there is not enough information** to classify the period as inflationary or deflationary.

The correct answer is:

**A: 1.25, Not enough information**

Answer: A
