Okay, so I need to figure out the total price of this dress after a markdown and including sales tax. Let me break it down step by step. 

The original price is $47.50, right? And it's been marked down by 30%. Hmm, markdown means it's a discount, so I should subtract 30% of 47.50 from the original price. Wait, but I remember that sometimes people get confused whether the markdown is applied first or something else. Oh, right, in this case, the markdown comes first because the sale is applied before tax usually.

So first, calculate the discount amount. 30% of 47.50. To find that, I can multiply 47.50 by 0.30. Let me do that math. 47.50 times 0.3. Let's see, 40 times 0.3 is 12, and 7.50 times 0.3 is 2.25. So 12 plus 2.25 equals 14.25. So the discount is $14.25.

Now subtract that from the original price to get the sale price. 47.50 minus 14.25. Let me calculate that. 47 minus 14 is 33, and 0.50 minus 0.25 is 0.25, so total is 33.25. So the sale price is $33.25.

But wait, there's a sales tax of 6% that needs to be paid on the dress. So I have to calculate the tax on the discounted price. So the tax is 6% of 33.25. Let me compute that. 33.25 times 0.06. Hmm, 30 times 0.06 is 1.80, and 3.25 times 0.06 is 0.195. Adding those together, 1.80 + 0.195 is 1.995. Wait, but I should round to two decimal places because it's money. So that's approximately $2.00.

So the total price is the sale price plus the tax. So 33.25 plus 2.00 is 35.25. Let me check the options to see which one matches. Looking at the options: F is $35.25, so that should be the answer. 

Wait, but wait a second. Let me recheck my calculations to be sure. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere. So, 30% off of 47.50 is 14.25. Subtracting that gives 33.25. Then 6% tax on 33.25. Let me calculate 33.25 * 0.06 again. 33 times 0.06 is 1.98, and 0.25 times 0.06 is 0.015. So total tax is 1.98 + 0.015 = 1.995, which is $1.995, but when dealing with money, we round to the nearest cent. So that's $2.00. So adding that to 33.25 gives 35.25. 

So yes, I think F is correct. I don't see where I could have messed up. But just to be thorough, let me consider another approach. Maybe using the formula: total price = original price * (1 - discount rate) * (1 + tax rate). Let's compute that.

So 47.50 * (1 - 0.30) is 47.50 * 0.70. 47.50 * 0.7 is 33.25. Then multiply by 1.06 for the tax. 33.25 * 1.06. Let me compute that. 33 * 1.06 is 34.98, and 0.25 * 1.06 is 0.265. So 34.98 + 0.265 = 35.245. Rounded to two decimal places is 35.25, which again is $35.25. So I'm confident that F is the correct answer.

To determine the total price of the dress after a 30% markdown and including a 6% sales tax, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the discount amount**:  
   The original price of the dress is $47.50, and it is marked down by 30%.  
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 47.50 \times 0.30 = 14.25
   \]

2. **Calculate the sale price**:  
   Subtract the discount from the original price:  
   \[
   \text{Sale Price} = 47.50 - 14.25 = 33.25
   \]

3. **Calculate the sales tax**:  
   A 6% sales tax is applied to the sale price:  
   \[
   \text{Sales Tax} = 33.25 \times 0.06 = 1.995
   \]  
   Rounded to two decimal places, the sales tax is $2.00.

4. **Calculate the total price**:  
   Add the sales tax to the sale price:  
   \[
   \text{Total Price} = 33.25 + 2.00 = 35.25
   \]

Thus, the total price of the dress is **$35.25**, which corresponds to option **F**.
