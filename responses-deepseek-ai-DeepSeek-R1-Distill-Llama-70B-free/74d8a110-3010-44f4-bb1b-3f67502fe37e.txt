Okay, so I have this question here about online stock brokerages, and I need to figure out which company isn't one of them. Let me think through this step by step.

The options are A through G, with the companies listed as DLJ Direct, Ameritrade, E*Trade, Charles Schwab, Fidelity Investments, Datek Online, and EDigital. My task is to identify which one is not an online stock brokerage.

First, I'll go through each option one by one. I remember that many of these names were big in the late 90s and early 2000s as online trading became popular.

Starting with option A: DLJ Direct. I think DLJ stands for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. They were a financial services company, and I believe they had an online trading platform called DLJ Direct. So that's an online brokerage.

Option B: Ameritrade. I'm pretty sure Ameritrade is a well-known online brokerage firm. They've been around for a while and have been involved in several mergers, like with TD Waterhouse. Definitely an online stock brokerage.

Option C: E*Trade. Oh yeah, E*Trade is one of the most famous online brokerages. They ran those talking baby commercials a few years back. They offer online trading services, so they're definitely in the business.

Option D: Charles Schwab. Charles Schwab is a big name in brokerage services. They've been around for a long time and were one of the first to offer discount brokerage services. They have a strong online presence, so they're an online stock brokerage.

Option E: Fidelity Investments. Fidelity is another major financial services company. They offer a wide range of investment products and have a robust online platform for trading. So Fidelity is definitely an online brokerage.

Option F: Datek Online. I remember Datek being an online brokerage that was quite popular, especially in the late 90s. They were known for their low fees and online trading platform. So Datek Online is an online stock brokerage.

Now, option G: EDigital. Hmm, EDigital doesn't ring a bell as a brokerage firm. I'm trying to think if I've heard of them in the context of online trading. The name sounds more like a technology or digital services company rather than a financial one. I don't recall any major online brokerages by that name. Maybe they're a different kind of company altogether, perhaps in electronics or digital media.

So, putting it all together, options A through F are all known online stock brokerages, while G, EDigital, doesn't fit. Therefore, the answer must be G.

The question asks which company is not an online stock brokerage. Let's analyze each option:

- **A: DLJ Direct** - This was an online trading platform from Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, so it is an online brokerage.
- **B: Ameritrade** - A well-known online brokerage firm, now part of TD Ameritrade.
- **C: E*Trade** - Famous for its online trading services and marketing campaigns.
- **D: Charles Schwab** - A major financial services company with a strong online presence.
- **E: Fidelity Investments** - Offers comprehensive online trading services.
- **F: Datek Online** - Known for its online trading platform, especially in the late 90s.
- **G: EDigital** - Does not appear to be associated with online stock brokerage services; the name suggests a technology or digital services company instead.

Thus, the company that is not an online stock brokerage is **EDigital**.

Answer: G
