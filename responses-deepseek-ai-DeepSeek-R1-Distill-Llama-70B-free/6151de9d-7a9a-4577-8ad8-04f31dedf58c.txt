Question:

Mrs. Walter gave an exam in a mathematics class of five students. She entered the scores in random order into a spreadsheet, which recalculated the class average after each score was entered. Mrs. Walter noticed that after each score was entered, the average was always an integer. The scores (listed in ascending order) were 71,76,80,82,and 91. What was the last score Mrs. Walter entered?

Options:

A: 82
B: 91
C: 71
D: The score that was the mode of the five scores
E: The score that made the average 75
F: 80
G: A score not listed among the five provided scores
H: The score that was the median of the five scores
I: 76
J: The score that made the average 79

Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, Mrs. Walter has five math scores: 71, 76, 80, 82, and 91. She's entering them one by one into a spreadsheet, and after each entry, the average is an integer. We need to find out which score was entered last.

Hmm, the key here is that after each entry, the average is an integer. So for each step—1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th—the average of the numbers entered so far must be a whole number.

Let me think about the properties of averages. The average being an integer means that the sum of the numbers entered up to that point must be divisible by the number of entries. So for each step n (where n is 1 to 5), the sum of the first n numbers must be divisible by n.

Let me list out the scores in ascending order again: 71,76,80,82,91.

I think I should consider the cumulative sums and their divisibility.

Let me denote the order of entry as S1, S2, S3, S4, S5.

We need to find the order such that each partial sum S1, S1+S2, S1+S2+S3, etc., are divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 respectively.

Wait, but 1 divides any integer, so S1 can be any of the scores. So the first entry doesn't give us any restriction except being one of the numbers.

The second entry's sum must be even, because average is sum/2 must be integer. So sum after two entries must be even, i.e., S1 + S2 must be even. So S1 and S2 must be both even or both odd.

Looking at the scores:

71 is odd

76 is even

80 is even

82 is even

91 is odd

So the two odd numbers are 71 and 91. The rest are even. So the sum of two odds is even, and sum of two evens is even, but sum of odd and even is odd. So for S1 + S2 to be even, the second entry must have the same parity as the first.

So let's think about possible first two entries.

If the first is 71 (odd), the second must be 91 (the only other odd). Then their sum is 71+91=162. 162/2=81, which is integer. So that's possible.

Alternatively, if the first entry is an even number, then the second must be even as well. So for example, first could be 76, and second 80, sum 156, average 78. Which is integer.

But wait, what about after three entries? The sum must be divisible by three. So let's think deeper.

Wait, maybe another approach. Maybe look at the total sum of all five numbers and see if that gives any clues. The total sum is 71+76=147, 147+80=227, 227+82=309, 309+91=400. So total sum is 400. The average of all five is 400/5=80, which is an integer, so that's consistent.

Now, for the last entry, when the sum after four entries must be divisible by 4, and adding the fifth makes the sum 400, which is divisible by 5.

So, sum after four entries is (400 - last_entry). So (400 - last_entry) must be divisible by 4. Therefore, last_entry must be congruent to 400 mod 4. Since 400 is divisible by 4 (400/4=100), 400 mod4=0. So last_entry mod4 must be 0.

Let me calculate each score mod4:

71: 71 /4 is 17*4=68, remainder 3. So 71 mod4=3.

76: 76/4=19, remainder 0. So 76 mod4=0.

80: 80/4=20, rem 0. So 80 mod4=0.

82: 82-80=2, so 82 mod4=2.

91: 91-88=3, 88 is 22*4, so 91 mod4=3.

So the last entry must be a score where mod4=0. Looking at the options, that's 76 and 80.

So the last entry is either 76 or 80.

But wait, the options given are A:82, B:91, C:71, D: mode (but all scores are unique, so no mode), E: average 75 (wait, when does that happen?), F:80, G: not listed, H: median (which is 80), I:76, J: average 79.

Wait, the question is to pick from the options. So the last entry must be either 76 or 80, which are options I and F.

Wait, but how do we decide which one?

Let me think about the conditions for each step. Let's consider the possible orders.

Let me try to see if 80 is the last entry. Then, the sum after four entries would be 400 -80=320. 320/4=80, which is integer. So that's possible.

Similarly, if the last entry is 76, sum after four entries is 400-76=324. 324/4=81, but 81 is not an integer because 324 divided by 4 is 81, wait no, 4*81=324, yes, it's 81 exactly. So that's also an integer. Hmm.

Wait, so both 76 and 80 as last entries are possible based on mod4 condition.

So I need another condition to determine which is correct.

Let's look at the third step. After three entries, the sum must be divisible by 3.

So sum after three entries S1+S2+S3 must be divisible by 3.

Let me consider if the last entry is 80. Then, the first four entries are 71,76,82,91, with sum 71+76=147, +82=229, +91=320. So sum after three would be 320 minus the fourth entry.

Wait no, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the order.

Alternatively, let me try to think about the possible sums at each step.

Let me list all possible sums for each step:

Step 1: sum is score entered, which is any of the five, no restriction except being one of them.

Step 2: sum must be even, so S1 and S2 must be both even or both odd.

Step 3: sum must be divisible by3.

Step4: sum must be divisible by4.

Step5: sum is 400, which is divisible by5.

So for the last entry, it's either 76 or 80.

Let me try each possibility.

First, let's suppose the last entry is 80.

Then, the sum of the first four entries is 400-80=320. 320 must be divisible by4, which it is (320/4=80).

Now, what about the sum after three entries? Let me see what possible sums could be.

The first three entries would be any combination of three numbers excluding 80. So the possible numbers would be 71,76,82,91.

Wait, but the first four entries sum to 320, which includes three entries plus the fourth. So, three entries would be 320 minus the fourth entry. But the fourth entry must be one of the remaining numbers: 71,76,82,91.

Wait, no. If the last entry is 80, then the first four entries are 71,76,82,91. Their sum is 71+76=147, +82=229, +91=320. So the sum after four is 320, which is correct.

Now, what about the sum after three entries? It could be 320 minus the fourth entry. The fourth entry could be any of the four numbers (71,76,82,91). So for the sum after three, possibilities:

If fourth entry is 71: sum after three is 320-71=249. 249/3=83, which is integer.

If fourth entry is76: sum after three is 320-76=244. 244/3 ≈81.333. Not integer. So that's invalid.

If fourth entry is82: sum after three is 320-82=238. 238/3≈79.333. Not integer.

If fourth entry is91: sum after three is 320-91=229. 229/3≈76.333. Not integer.

So the only way sum after three is integer is if the fourth entry is 71, making sum after three 249, which is 83 average.

So the order would have the first three entries summing to 249, and the fourth being 71. Wait, but that would mean that the fourth entry is 71. So the first three would be 76,82,91. Let's check: 76+82=158, +91=249. Yes.

So the order would be: first three entries are 76,82,91 in some order, then 71, then 80.

Wait, but let's check the second step. The sum after two entries must be even.

So let's say the first two entries are 76 and 82. Their sum is 158, which is even (average 79). Then, the third would be 91. Sum becomes 249 (average 83). Then, the fourth is 71. Sum becomes 320 (average 80). Then, the fifth is 80. Sum 400 (average 80).

So this seems to work.

Now, let's check if any other possibilities exist. Suppose the last entry is 76 instead of 80. Then, the sum after four entries would be 400-76=324. 324/4=81, which is integer.

So the first four entries would be 71,80,82,91. Their sum is 71+80=151 +82=233 +91=324. Correct.

Now, for the third entry, the sum after three would be 324 minus the fourth entry.

The fourth entry could be 71,80,82, or91.

If fourth entry is71: sum after three is324-71=253. 253/3≈84.333. Not integer.

If fourth entry is80: sum after three is324-80=244. 244/3≈81.333. Not integer.

If fourth entry is82: sum after three is324-82=242. 242/3≈80.666. Not integer.

If fourth entry is91: sum after three is324-91=233. 233/3≈77.666. Not integer.

None of these give an integer average after three entries. So this scenario is invalid.

Therefore, the last entry cannot be 76. So the last entry must be 80.

Wait, but earlier when last entry was 80, it worked. So the last entry is 80, which is option F.

Wait, but let me double-check another possibility. What if the first entry is 71, and the second is91? Then sum after two is162 (average81). Then, third entry could be 76, making sum 162+76=238. But 238/3≈79.333, not integer. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, but earlier when we took the first three as 76,82,91, sum 249, which worked. So perhaps the order starts with 76, then 82, then91, then71, then80.

Another approach: Let's list all possible sums for each step.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think about the cumulative sums and see which order fits.

The possible steps:

After 1st entry: sum is S1.

After 2nd: sum = S1+S2 must be even.

After 3rd: sum must be divisible by3.

After 4th: sum must be divisible by4.

After5th: 400.

We have to find an order where each step's sum meets the condition.

Let me try the order where the last entry is 80.

So, the first four entries are 71,76,82,91, sum 320.

Let me see if their order can satisfy the step conditions.

Suppose the order is 76,82,91,71,80.

Check each step:

1. 76: sum=76, average=76. Good.

2. 76+82=158. 158/2=79. Good.

3. 158+91=249. 249/3=83. Good.

4. 249+71=320. 320/4=80. Good.

5. 320+80=400. 400/5=80. Good.

This works. So the last entry is 80.

Alternatively, maybe another order could have 80 as the last.

Wait, but earlier when I considered the last entry being 76, it didn't work because the third step's sum wasn't divisible by3.

So, the last entry must be 80, which is option F.

To determine the last score Mrs. Walter entered, we analyze the conditions given: after each score is entered, the average must be an integer. This means the sum of the scores entered up to that point must be divisible by the number of entries (1 through 5). The scores are 71, 76, 80, 82, and 91, and their total sum is 400.

### Key Observations:
1. **Total Sum**: The total sum of all five scores is 400, which is divisible by 5, confirming the final average is 80.
2. **Last Entry Condition**: The sum of the first four entries must be divisible by 4. Let the last entry be \( x \). Then, \( 400 - x \) must be divisible by 4, meaning \( x \mod 4 = 0 \).
   - Calculating \( \mod 4 \) for each score:
     - \( 71 \mod 4 = 3 \)
     - \( 76 \mod 4 = 0 \)
     - \( 80 \mod 4 = 0 \)
     - \( 82 \mod 4 = 2 \)
     - \( 91 \mod 4 = 3 \)
   - Only 76 and 80 satisfy \( x \mod 4 = 0 \).

3. **Testing the Last Entry**:
   - If the last entry is **80**, the sum of the first four entries is \( 400 - 80 = 320 \), which is divisible by 4 (\( 320 / 4 = 80 \)).
     - The first four entries would be 71, 76, 82, and 91. Their sum is \( 71 + 76 + 82 + 91 = 320 \), which is valid.
     - Checking earlier steps:
       - After the first entry (e.g., 76): \( 76 \) is divisible by 1.
       - After the second entry (e.g., 82): \( 76 + 82 = 158 \), which is divisible by 2 (\( 158 / 2 = 79 \)).
       - After the third entry (e.g., 91): \( 76 + 82 + 91 = 249 \), which is divisible by 3 (\( 249 / 3 = 83 \)).
       - After the fourth entry (e.g., 71): \( 76 + 82 + 91 + 71 = 320 \), which is divisible by 4 (\( 320 / 4 = 80 \)).
   - If the last entry is **76**, the sum of the first four entries is \( 400 - 76 = 324 \), which is divisible by 4 (\( 324 / 4 = 81 \)).
     - However, checking earlier steps:
       - After the third entry, the sum \( 324 - x \) (where \( x \) is the fourth entry) must be divisible by 3. Testing all possibilities for \( x \) (71, 80, 82, 91) shows none result in a sum divisible by 3. Thus, 76 cannot be the last entry.

### Conclusion:
The only valid last entry is **80**, as it satisfies all conditions, including the divisibility requirements at each step.
