Question:

An owner entered into a written contract with a landscaper whereby the landscaper promised to landscape the exterior of the owner's house for the sum of $5,000. According to their agreement, the owner was to pay the money to the landscaper's son. The landscaper intended to have the $5,000 given to his son as a graduation present. After the landscaper completed the job, the landscaper requested that the owner pay the $5,000 to him instead of to his son. The owner paid the landscaper. The next day, the son learned of the contract between the landscaper and the owner, as well as the payment to his father. In an action by the son against the owner for $5,000, the plaintiff will most likely

Options:

A: prevail, because the written contract between the owner and the landscaper operated as a valid assignment to the son.
B: prevail, because the son was the intended beneficiary under the terms of the written contract between the owner and the landscaper.
C: not prevail, because the son did not give any consideration.
D: prevail, because the owner had a duty to honor the original agreement.
E: not prevail, because the landscaper, as the original contractor, had the right to alter the terms of payment.
F: not prevail, because the son was not a party to the original contract.
G: not prevail, because the son was not directly involved in the contractual agreement.
H: prevail, because the owner breached the contract by not paying the son.
I: prevail, because the son was a third party beneficiary of the contract.
J: not prevail, because the owner and the landscaper effectively modified their agreement, thereby depriving the son of any rights he may have had.

Okay, so I have this question about contract law, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

An owner hired a landscaper to do some work for $5,000. The contract said the owner would pay the landscaper's son instead. The landscaper wanted this as a graduation gift. After the work was done, the landscaper asked the owner to pay him directly, and the owner did. The next day, the son found out about the contract and the payment. Now, the son is suing the owner for the $5,000. The question is whether the son will prevail.

Hmm, I remember that when a contract is made for the benefit of a third party, that third party might be able to enforce it. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. So let's think step by step.

First, the contract between the owner and the landscaper. They agreed that the payment would go to the son. So the son is a third-party beneficiary. But under what circumstances can a third party enforce a contract?

I think there are two types of third-party beneficiaries: intended and incidental. An intended beneficiary is someone the parties intended to benefit directly, like when one party makes a gift. An incidental beneficiary is someone who benefits indirectly, but that's not the main intention.

In this case, the landscaper intended the $5,000 as a gift to his son, so the son is an intended beneficiary. But wait, the general rule is that the third party can only enforce the contract if they are an intended beneficiary, and the contract's terms show that intention.

But then, what about when the obligor (the owner) changes the payment? The owner was supposed to pay the son, but then paid the landscaper instead. So the question is, can the son still sue the owner?

Another point: the landscaper, after completing the work, asked the owner to pay him instead. The owner complied. So the owner paid the landscaper, not the son. Did this modify the contract?

I think for a modification to be valid, both parties need to agree. The original contract was between the owner and the landscaper. So if the owner and the landscaper agree to change the payment terms, that modifies the contract. But does that affect the son's rights?

Wait, but the son wasn't a party to the original contract. So if the contract was modified by the two parties (owner and landscaper), the son's rights might be affected. But does the son have any rights in the first place?

In some jurisdictions, once a third-party beneficiary's rights have vested, the original parties can't modify the contract to deprive them of those rights without their consent. When do the rights vest? I think it's when the beneficiary relies on the contract or brings a lawsuit on it, or perhaps when they are notified.

In this case, the son didn't know about the contract until after the payment was made. So he didn't have any reliance yet. Therefore, the original parties (owner and landscaper) could modify the contract, changing the payment to the landscaper, and the son wouldn't have a claim because his rights hadn't vested yet.

So looking at the options:

Option B says the son prevails because he's an intended beneficiary. But if the contract was modified before his rights vested, that might not hold.

Option J says the son doesn't prevail because the contract was modified. That seems plausible.

Option C says no because no consideration from the son. But the son doesn't need to provide consideration to be a beneficiary; the consideration is between the original parties.

Option I: same as B, about being a third-party beneficiary.

Option E: the landscaper can change terms. Well, the landscaper is a party, so he can modify the contract with the owner's agreement.

So the key here is whether the son's rights had vested before the modification. Since he found out the next day, after the payment, he didn't have a chance to rely on it. So the modification would be effective, and the son can't claim.

Wait, but another angle: when the contract was made, the landscaper assigned the right to payment to the son. Assignments can sometimes be effective even without consideration. But assignments are different from third-party beneficiary rights.

Wait, the contract said the owner would pay the son. So is that an assignment of the right to receive payment? Or is it just a direction to pay someone else, which the obligor (owner) can change if the obligee (landscaper) agrees.

In the UCC, for instance, a party can direct payment to another, but that doesn't necessarily create an assignment. It might be considered a third-party beneficiary situation.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to clarify.

If the contract says that payment should be made to the son, that could be seen as the landscaper's way of making the son an intended beneficiary. So the son has a right to that payment.

But if the landscaper later tells the owner to pay him instead, that's a modification. So the question is whether the son's rights had already vested, preventing such modification without his consent.

In general, the rights of a third-party beneficiary vest when:

1. The beneficiary learns of the contract and agrees to it,
2. The beneficiary brings a lawsuit on it, or
3. The beneficiary changes position in reliance on it.

In this case, the son learned of the contract only after the payment was made to the landscaper. So he didn't have any opportunity to rely on it, bring a lawsuit, or agree to it before the modification. Therefore, his rights hadn't vested yet.

So the owner and landscaper could modify the contract, and the son doesn't have a claim.

Looking back at the options:

Option J says the son doesn't prevail because the owner and landscaper modified the agreement, depriving the son of rights.

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer is J.
</think>

The question revolves around whether the son, as a third-party beneficiary, can recover $5,000 from the owner after the owner paid the landscaper instead of the son, as per the modified agreement between the owner and the landscaper. The key issue is whether the son's rights as a third-party beneficiary had vested before the modification.

The son was intended to benefit from the contract as a gift, making him an intended third-party beneficiary. However, for a third party's rights to vest, they must either: (1) learn of the contract and agree to it, (2) bring a lawsuit on it, or (3) materially rely on it. In this case, the son learned of the contract only after the payment had already been made to the landscaper, meaning he had no opportunity to rely on it or take any action to vest his rights.

Since the son's rights had not yet vested, the owner and the landscaper were free to modify the contract. The owner's payment to the landscaper instead of the son was a valid modification of the original agreement, and the son cannot now enforce the original payment terms. Therefore, the son cannot prevail in his claim against the owner.

The correct answer is:

**J: not prevail, because the owner and the landscaper effectively modified their agreement, thereby depriving the son of any rights he may have had.**

Answer: J
