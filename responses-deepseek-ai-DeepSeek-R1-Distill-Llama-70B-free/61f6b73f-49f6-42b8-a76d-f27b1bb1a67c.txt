Okay, so I've got this statistics problem here about calculating Z-scores for different raw scores. The question says that the random variable X is normally distributed with a mean of 118 and a standard deviation of 11. I need to find the Z-scores for the raw scores 115, 134, and 99. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the Z-score formula is Z = (X - μ) / σ, where X is the raw score, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation. So for each raw score, I'll subtract the mean and then divide by the standard deviation.

Let me start with the first score, 115. Plugging into the formula, that's (115 - 118) divided by 11. So 115 minus 118 is -3. Then divide by 11, which gives me approximately -0.2727. Rounding that to two decimal places, it's about -0.27. So the Z-score for 115 is -0.27.

Next, the second raw score is 134. Using the same formula: (134 - 118) / 11. 134 minus 118 is 16. 16 divided by 11 is roughly 1.4545. Rounded to two decimals, that's 1.45. So the Z-score here is 1.45.

Now the last raw score is 99. Applying the formula again: (99 - 118) /11. 99 minus 118 is -19. Dividing -19 by 11 gives approximately -1.7273. Rounded, that's about -1.73. So the Z-score for 99 is -1.73.

Putting it all together, the Z-scores are -0.27 for 115, 1.45 for 134, and -1.73 for 99. Now I need to match this to the options given.

Looking at the options:

Option A: -.27, 1.45, 1.73 — Wait, the third one is positive 1.73, but I calculated -1.73 for 99. So A doesn't match.

Option B: -.27, -1.45, -1.73 — The second score here is negative, but I got 1.45 which is positive. So B is out.

Option C: -2.18, 0.15, -1.82 — Doesn't match any of my calculations.

Option D: 0, 1.5, -2 — No, I got -0.27, not 0.

Option E: .27, 1.45, 1.73 — The first is positive, but I had -0.27. So E's first Z is wrong.

Option F: -.27, 1.45, -1.73 — Oh wait, that's exactly what I got! So F matches.

Let me check the other options just to be sure. Option G has -1, 2, -2. Doesn't match. H is -0.5, 1.2, -1.5: nope. I is .27, -1.45, 0.73: Not matching. J is 2.73, -0.27, 0.45: Also doesn't fit.

So the correct option must be F.

To calculate the Z-scores for the given raw scores (115, 134, 99), we use the formula:

\[
Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}
\]

where \( \mu = 118 \) (mean) and \( \sigma = 11 \) (standard deviation).

1. **For \( X = 115 \):**
   \[
   Z = \frac{115 - 118}{11} = \frac{-3}{11} \approx -0.27
   \]

2. **For \( X = 134 \):**
   \[
   Z = \frac{134 - 118}{11} = \frac{16}{11} \approx 1.45
   \]

3. **For \( X = 99 \):**
   \[
   Z = \frac{99 - 118}{11} = \frac{-19}{11} \approx -1.73
   \]

Thus, the Z-scores are approximately \(-0.27\), \(1.45\), and \(-1.73\). Comparing these values to the options provided, the correct match is:

**Option F: \(-.27, 1.45, -1.73\)**.
