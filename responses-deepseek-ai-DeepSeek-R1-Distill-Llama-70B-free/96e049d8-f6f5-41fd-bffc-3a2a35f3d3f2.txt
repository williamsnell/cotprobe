Okay, so I've got this integral to solve: the integral of the curl of vector A dotted with da over a surface S. The vector A is given as y i + z j + x k, and the surface S is a paraboloid defined by z = 1 - x² - y² with z ≥ 0. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

First, I remember that the integral of the curl of a vector field over a surface is related to Stokes' theorem. Stokes' theorem says that the integral of (curl A) · da over S is equal to the line integral of A · dr around the boundary curve of S. So maybe I can use that instead of calculating the surface integral directly.

Wait, but what's the boundary of the surface S? The surface is a paraboloid opening downward, right? Because z = 1 - x² - y². When z is zero, that's the circle x² + y² = 1 in the xy-plane. So the boundary of S is that circle in the plane z=0.

So the boundary curve C is the circle x² + y² = 1 in the plane z=0. I can parameterize this curve. Since it's a circle in the xy-plane, maybe using cylindrical coordinates would help. Let's let x = cosθ, y = sinθ, and z = 0, with θ going from 0 to 2π.

Now, I need to compute the line integral of A · dr around this curve. The vector field A is y i + z j + x k. But on the curve, z=0, so A becomes y i + 0 j + x k. Plugging in the parameterization, x = cosθ, y = sinθ. So A becomes sinθ i + 0 j + cosθ k.

Next, I need to find dr. Since the parameterization is r(θ) = cosθ i + sinθ j + 0 k, then dr/dθ = -sinθ dθ i + cosθ dθ j + 0 k. So dr is (-sinθ i + cosθ j) dθ.

Now, the dot product A · dr would be [sinθ i + cosθ k] · [-sinθ i + cosθ j] dθ. Wait, let me compute that. The i component is sinθ * (-sinθ) = -sin²θ. The j component is 0 * cosθ = 0. The k component is cosθ * 0 = 0. So the dot product is -sin²θ dθ.

So the integral becomes ∫ (from θ=0 to θ=2π) of -sin²θ dθ. Hmm, that's the same as -∫ sin²θ dθ from 0 to 2π.

I remember that the integral of sin²θ over 0 to 2π is π, because the average value of sin² is 1/2 over the interval, so 1/2 * 2π = π. So multiplying by -1 gives -π.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me double-check the steps. Did I make any mistakes in the parameterization or the dot product?

Let me go through it again. A on the curve C is y i + x k because z=0. So substituting x=cosθ, y=sinθ, A = sinθ i + cosθ k.

Dr is the derivative of r with respect to θ times dθ. r is cosθ i + sinθ j, so dr/dθ is -sinθ i + cosθ j. So dr is (-sinθ i + cosθ j) dθ.

Dotting A with dr: (sinθ)(-sinθ) + (cosθ)(cosθ) → wait, no, wait. Wait, A is sinθ i + cosθ k. So when you dot with dr, which is (-sinθ i + cosθ j), the j component in A is zero, so only i and j terms matter.

Wait, no, A has i and k components. Dr has i and j components. So the dot product is (sinθ)(-sinθ) + (0)(cosθ) + (cosθ)(0) ) because dr has no k component. So yes, that's -sin²θ. So the integral is correct.

So the integral is -∫ sin²θ dθ from 0 to 2π. And the integral of sin²θ over 0 to 2π is π, so the result is -π.

Looking back at the options, option I is -π, so that should be the answer.

To solve the integral $\int_S (\nabla \times \mathbf{A}) \cdot d\mathbf{a}$, we use Stokes' theorem, which equates the surface integral of the curl of a vector field to the line integral of the vector field around the boundary of the surface. The vector field is given as $\mathbf{A} = y \mathbf{i} + z \mathbf{j} + x \mathbf{k}$, and the surface $S$ is the paraboloid $z = 1 - x^2 - y^2$ with $z \geq 0$. The boundary of $S$ is the circle $x^2 + y^2 = 1$ in the plane $z = 0$.

We parameterize the boundary curve $C$ as $\mathbf{r}(\theta) = \cos\theta \mathbf{i} + \sin\theta \mathbf{j}$, where $\theta$ ranges from $0$ to $2\pi$. The vector field $\mathbf{A}$ on $C$ becomes $\mathbf{A} = \sin\theta \mathbf{i} + \cos\theta \mathbf{k}$ (since $z = 0$). The differential element $\mathbf{dr}$ is computed as $\mathbf{dr} = -\sin\theta \mathbf{i} + \cos\theta \mathbf{j}$.

The dot product $\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{dr}$ is:
\[
\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{dr} = (\sin\theta)(-\sin\theta) + (0)(\cos\theta) + (\cos\theta)(0) = -\sin^2\theta.
\]

Thus, the line integral becomes:
\[
\int_C \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{dr} = \int_0^{2\pi} -\sin^2\theta \, d\theta.
\]

The integral of $\sin^2\theta$ over $[0, 2\pi]$ is $\pi$, so:
\[
\int_C \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{dr} = -\pi.
\]

By Stokes' theorem, this result is equal to the original surface integral. Therefore, the value of the integral is $-\pi$.

The correct answer is **I: $-\pi$**.
