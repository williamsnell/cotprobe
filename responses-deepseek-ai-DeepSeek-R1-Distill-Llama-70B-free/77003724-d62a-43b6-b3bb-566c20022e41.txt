Question:

Plaid Pants, Inc. common stock has a beta of 0.90, while Acme Dynamite Company common stock has a beta of 1.80. The expected return on the market is 10 percent, and the risk-free rate is 6 percent. According to the capital-asset pricing model (CAPM) and making use of the information above, the required return on Plaid Pants' common stock should be , and the required return on Acme's common stock should be .

A: 6.0 percent; 12.0 percent
B: 9.6 percent; 13.2 percent
C: 10.8 percent; 21.6 percent
D: 12.0 percent; 19.2 percent
E: 11.7 percent; 20.4 percent
F: 14.0 percent; 23.0 percent
G: 7.2 percent; 14.4 percent

Okay, so I need to figure out the required returns for Plaid Pants and Acme Dynamite using the CAPM model. Hmm, I remember that CAPM is the Capital Asset Pricing Model, right? It helps estimate the expected return on an investment based on its risk. 

So the formula for CAPM is: Required Return = Risk-Free Rate + Beta*(Expected Market Return - Risk-Free Rate). Oh yeah, that's right. So it's Rf + Î²*(Rm - Rf).

Let me look at the given data. Plaid Pants has a beta of 0.90, and Acme's beta is 1.80. The expected market return is 10%, and the risk-free rate is 6%. 

Let's calculate each one step by step. 

Starting with Plaid Pants. Beta is 0.9. So plug into the formula: 6% + 0.9*(10% -6%). Let me compute the (10-6) first. That's 4%. Multiply by 0.9: 0.9 *4 = 3.6%. So add that to the risk-free rate: 6% +3.6% = 9.6%. So Plaid Pants' required return is 9.6%.

Now for Acme. Beta is 1.8. Using the same formula. So 6% + 1.8*(10% -6%). Again, 10-6 is 4, 1.8 *4 is 7.2. Add that to 6% gives 13.2%.

Wait wait, so Plaid is 9.6% and Acme is 13.2%. Let me look at the options. Option B says 9.6% and 13.2%, which matches my calculations.

I think that's correct. Wait, did I mix up the betas? No, Plaid has a lower beta so its return should be lower than the market's 10%. Oh wait, no. Wait, the market's expected return is 10%, so Plaid's beta is less than 1, so their required return should be less than 10%? Wait but 9.6% is less than 10%, right. Because beta less than 1 means lower risk, so lower required return than the market. And Acme's beta is higher than 1, so their required return is higher than the market's 10%.

Yes, that makes sense. So B seems correct.

To determine the required returns for Plaid Pants and Acme Dynamite using the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), we use the formula:

\[
\text{Required Return} = R_f + \beta \times (R_m - R_f)
\]

### Given Data:
- **Plaid Pants**: Beta (\(\beta\)) = 0.90  
- **Acme Dynamite**: Beta (\(\beta\)) = 1.80  
- Expected market return (\(R_m\)) = 10%  
- Risk-free rate (\(R_f\)) = 6%  

### Calculations:
1. **Plaid Pants**:  
   \[
   \text{Required Return} = 6\% + 0.90 \times (10\% - 6\%) = 6\% + 0.90 \times 4\% = 6\% + 3.6\% = 9.6\%
   \]

2. **Acme Dynamite**:  
   \[
   \text{Required Return} = 6\% + 1.80 \times (10\% - 6\%) = 6\% + 1.80 \times 4\% = 6\% + 7.2\% = 13.2\%
   \]

### Conclusion:
The required return for Plaid Pants is **9.6%**, and for Acme Dynamite, it is **13.2%**. Comparing these results with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**B: 9.6 percent; 13.2 percent**

B
