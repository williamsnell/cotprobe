Okay, so I have to find the wavelength of a photon that can cause an electron to jump from the valence band to the conduction band in silicon at 300 K. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

I remember that the energy required for this transition is the band gap of silicon. Oh wait, what's the band gap of silicon again? I think it's around 1.1 electron volts (eV). I've heard that it's a common semiconductor, so that sounds right.

So the energy of the photon needs to be at least equal to this band gap. The energy of a photon is given by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength. But wait, I need to make sure the units are correct. Oh right, sometimes it's easier to use the formula with eV and nm because the constants can be simplified.

I recall that hc is approximately 1240 eV·nm. So if E is in eV and λ is in nm, the equation becomes E = 1240 / λ. Rearranging that, λ = 1240 / E.

Since the band gap is 1.1 eV, plugging that in: λ = 1240 / 1.1. Let me calculate that. 1240 divided by 1.1. Hmm, 1240 divided by 1 is 1240. 1240 divided by 1.1 is like 1240 * (10/11) which is 1123.81 nm approximately. Oh wait, rounding that off, it's about 1120 nm. Looking at the options, option B is 1130.0, which is pretty close. Option F is 1100.0, which is also near.

Wait, but wait. Did I forget something about temperature? The question says the temperature is 300 K. Oh right, the band gap can vary slightly with temperature. At room temperature (around 300 K), the band gap for silicon is indeed approximately 1.1 eV. So I think my initial calculation holds.

But wait, another thought: sometimes the band gap is given at 0 K, and at higher temperatures it decreases a bit. Let me think. The band gap of silicon at 300 K is about 1.12 eV? Or was it 1.11? I'm not entirely sure. If it's a bit higher, say around 1.12 eV, then the wavelength would be a bit lower.

Wait, let's double-check. The exact band gap of silicon at 300 K is about 1.12 eV. So if E is 1.12 eV, then λ = 1240 / 1.12 ≈ 1107 nm. Hmm, that's closer to option F (1100) or B (1130). But the options are precise. Alternatively, maybe the question is approximated to 1.1 eV. Let me calculate with 1.1 eV again: 1240 / 1.1 is 1127.27 nm. So about 1127 nm. Looking at the options, B is 1130, which is very close. Alternatively, maybe the question expects the use of 1.1 eV, leading to option B as the answer.

Wait, another point: sometimes the energy is given in terms of the photon's energy exceeding the band gap, but for emission, but in this case, we're considering absorption, so the photon's energy must be at least equal to the band gap. So I think my approach is correct.

So putting it all together, the wavelength should be approximately 1127 nm, so the closest option is B: 1130.0 nm. Alternatively, if the exact band gap used is a bit different, perhaps 1.11 eV, which would give λ = 1240 / 1.11 ≈ 1117 nm. Still, option B is the closest.

Wait, another thought: sometimes in these problems, the temperature is considered through the Fermi-Dirac distribution, but I think that's more about the probability of electrons being in the conduction band, not the required photon energy. So maybe I can ignore it for this calculation.

So I think the correct answer is option B: 1130.0 nm.

To determine the wavelength of the photon necessary to cause an electron to jump from the valence band to the conduction band in silicon at 300 K, we start by identifying the band gap energy of silicon. At 300 K, the band gap of silicon is approximately **1.1 eV**. The energy of a photon is related to its wavelength by the equation:

\[
E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

Where:
- \( E \) is the energy of the photon (in eV),
- \( h \) is Planck's constant,
- \( c \) is the speed of light,
- \( \lambda \) is the wavelength (in nm).

Using the simplified form of the equation for energy in eV and wavelength in nm, we have:

\[
E = \frac{1240}{\lambda}
\]

Rearranging for \( \lambda \):

\[
\lambda = \frac{1240}{E}
\]

Substituting \( E = 1.1 \, \text{eV} \):

\[
\lambda = \frac{1240}{1.1} \approx 1127.27 \, \text{nm}
\]

This value is closest to **1130.0 nm**, which corresponds to option B. While the band gap of silicon at 300 K can vary slightly (e.g., 1.11–1.12 eV), the calculation assumes the commonly used value of 1.1 eV for simplicity. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**B: 1130.0 nm**
