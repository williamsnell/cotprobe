Okay, I've got this problem here about Parker Bros accepting a draft and then discounting it. Hmm, let's try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on some of these finance terms, but I'll try to think through it.

So, the draft is for $3500, with 6% interest. It's dated April 5 and due in 6 months. Parker Bros discounts it on August 20 at a discount rate of 6.5%, and the bank charges a 1/3% collection fee. I need to find the proceeds.

Wait, let's clarify the terms. A draft is like a bill of exchange, right? So Parker Bros is probably the drawee, and they accepted it, meaning they have to pay it when it's due. But now they're discounting it, meaning they're selling it to a bank before maturity to get cash now.

The draft is due in 6 months from April 5. So the due date is October 5. Because April has 30 days, so adding 6 months would make it October 5th. But wait, when you count months, sometimes it's better to add them one by one. April 5 plus 6 months would be October 5, yes.

But the discounting happens on August 20. So the time from August 20 to October 5 is the period we're considering for the discount. I need to calculate the number of days between those dates.

Let's see. August 20 to August 31 is 11 days (since 31-20=11). Then September has 30 days, and October 5 is 5 days. So 11 + 30 +5 = 46 days. Oh wait, wait, wait. Wait, when counting days between two dates, do we include the start date or the end date? I think when calculating the period from August 20 to October 5, it's 46 days. Because August 20 is day 0, and we count up to October 5 as day 46.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the exact number of days. Let me think. From August 20 to August 31 is 12 days (including the 20th? Or not? Hmm, no, because when you discount on August 20, the next day is the 21st. So from August 20 to August 31 is 12 days: 31-20=11, but since we include both the start and end, it's 12 days? Wait, no, no. Wait, when you have a period from day 1 to day 2, that's 1 day. So from August 20 to August 31 is 12 days (31-20+1=12). But wait, in financial calculations, sometimes they use 360 days a year, but this problem doesn't specify, so maybe it's exact days.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to calculate the number of days using a different method. Let me think: August has 31 days. So from August 20 to August 31 is 31-20=11 days, but since the 20th is included, it's 12 days? No, wait, if you're counting the days between August 20 (inclusive) and August 31 (inclusive), it's 12 days. Because 31 -20 =11, plus 1 equals 12. But I'm not entirely sure about that. Alternatively, maybe it's 11 days because you're moving from day 20 to 31, which is 11 days later.

Wait, perhaps it's best to calculate the days accurately. Let's list the days:

From August 20 to August 31: 12 days (including both the 20th and 31st).

Then September: 30 days.

Then October 1 to 5: 5 days.

So total: 12 + 30 +5 =47 days? Wait, no, wait. Because August 20 to August 31 is 12 days, September is 30, and October 1-5 is 5 days. So 12+30+5=47 days. Wait, but wait, when you discount on August 20, that day is counted as day 0, and the next day (21st) is day 1. So perhaps the period is 46 days? Because from August 20 (day 0) to October 5 (day 46). Let me do a quick calculation.

Alternatively, using a date calculator: August 20 to October 5.

Wait, August 20 to September 20 is 31 days (since August has 31 days, so from 20 to 31 is 12 days, then September 1-20 is 20 days: 12+20=32 days. Then September 21 to September 30 is 10 days (since 30-20=10), so total up to September 30 is 42 days. Then October 1-5 is 5 days, so 42+5=47 days. So the total days are 47.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Maybe I should think differently. Let me think about it this way: August has 31 days, so from August 20 to August 31 is 12 days (including both days). Then September is 30 days, October is 5 days. 12+30=42, plus 5 is 47 days. So from August 20 to October 5 is 47 days.

But wait, when calculating the discount, the formula is usually (principal) × (rate × time). Time is in years. So I need to convert 47 days into a fraction of a year.

If we're using a 360-day year, which is common in some financial calculations, 47 days is 47/360 years.

Alternatively, sometimes 365 days is used, but the problem doesn't specify. The interest on the draft is at 6%, but the discount rate is 6.5%, and the collection fee is 1/3% on the face value.

Wait, the problem says the bank charged a (1/3)% collection fee. So I need to subtract that from the proceeds.

So the steps I think are:

1. Calculate the interest on the draft from April 5 to August 20. Because the bank is discounting it on August 20, so any interest accrued up to that point would be considered?

Wait, no. Wait, when a bill is discounted, the formula is: proceeds = face value × (1 - discount rate × time).

But wait, no, the discount is calculated as: discount = face value × rate × time. Then proceeds = face value - discount.

But also, there's a collection fee to subtract.

Wait, let me think again. The bank is discounting the draft, which is a bill due in the future. So the discount represents the interest that would accrue from the discount date to the due date.

So the discount amount is calculated as:

Discount = Face value × discount rate × time (in years).

So time is the period from August 20 to October 5, which we thought was 47 days.

So, the discount is 3500 × (6.5/100) × (47/360).

Then, the proceeds before any fees would be Face value - discount.

Then, subtract the collection fee, which is (1/3)% of the face value.

Wait, the collection fee is (1/3)%, so 0.333...% of $3500.

So, putting it all together:

Proceeds = [3500 - (3500 × 0.065 × (47/360))] - (3500 × (1/3)/100)

Wait, but wait, does the collection fee apply to the discounted amount or to the face value? The problem says the bank charged a (1/3)% collection fee. So I think it's a fee based on the face value. So it's 3500 × (1/3)%.

Alternatively, perhaps the collection fee is subtracted after calculating the discounted proceeds. So the process is:

1. Calculate the discount on the draft.

Discount = 3500 × (6.5/100) × (47/360)

2. Subtract the discount from the face value to get the proceeds before fees.

Proceeds before fees = 3500 - discount.

3. Subtract the collection fee from this amount.

So, collection fee = 3500 × (1/3)/100 = 3500 × 0.003333...

So let's compute each part.

First, compute the discount.

47 days is 47/360 years.

So discount = 3500 * 0.065 * (47/360)

Let me calculate that:

0.065 * 47 = 3.055

3.055 /360 = approx 0.008486111

Then, 3500 * 0.008486111 = approx 29.7019.

So discount is about $29.70.

Proceeds before fees: 3500 - 29.70 = 3470.30.

Then subtract the collection fee.

Collection fee = 3500 * 0.003333... = 11.666666...

So proceeds after fees = 3470.30 - 11.666666... ≈ 3458.63.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, 47 days / 360 = 0.13055556.

0.065 * 0.13055556 = ?

0.065 * 0.13055556 = 0.008486111.

Then 3500 * 0.008486111 = 29.7019.

So discount is $29.70.

Proceeds before fees: 3500 - 29.70 = 3470.30.

Collection fee: 3500 * 0.003333... = 11.666...

So 3470.30 - 11.666... = 3458.63.

Looking at the options, the closest is option D: $3450.00, but wait, 3458.63 isn't exactly an option. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the days calculation.

Wait, maybe the time period is 46 days instead of 47. Let's recalculate with 46 days.

46/360 = 0.12777778.

0.065 * 0.12777778 = 0.00833333.

3500 * 0.00833333 = approx 29.166666.

Proceeds before fees: 3500 - 29.166666 = 3470.83333.

Then subtract collection fee: 11.666666.

3470.83333 - 11.666666 = 3459.1666.

Still not matching any options. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the interest on the draft is being considered. Wait, the draft bears interest at 6%. So from April 5 to August 20, which is 4 months and 15 days.

Wait, but the discounting is separate. Maybe I'm overcomplicating things. Let's think again: when you discount a bill, the discount is based on the time remaining until maturity.

So, the period is from August 20 to October 5, which we thought is 47 days. So discount is 3500 * 6.5% * (47/360).

Wait, but what if the days are calculated as 46? Let me recalculate.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the days calculation. Let me recount.

From August 20 to October 5:

August: 20 to 31 is 12 days (including 20th and 31st).

September: 30 days.

October: 5 days.

12 +30=42 +5=47 days.

But when the discount is applied on August 20, the time starts the next day, so maybe it's 46 days.

Wait, discounting is done on August 20, so the period is from August 21 to October 5. So that's August 21 to August 31: 11 days, September:30, October:5. 11+30+5=46 days.

Ah, that makes sense. Because the discounting occurs on the 20th, so the period is 46 days.

So time is 46 days.

So discount = 3500 * 0.065 * (46/360)

Compute 46/360 = 0.12777778.

0.065 * 0.12777778 = 0.00833333.

3500 * 0.00833333 = approx 29.166666.

So discount is $29.16666.

Proceeds before fees: 3500 - 29.16666 = 3470.83333.

Then subtract collection fee: 3500 * 0.00333333 = 11.66666.

So total proceeds: 3470.83333 - 11.66666 = 3459.16667.

Hmm, looking at the options, I don't see 3459.16. The closest is option D: $3450, but that's a bit lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the days calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, another approach: the due date is October 5. The discount date is August 20. So the number of days between them is 46 days, as we thought, because August 20 to October 5 is 46 days when counting from the day after.

Alternatively, perhaps the time is computed using the formula: (D2 - D1) where D2 is October 5 and D1 is August 20, but in terms of days.

Wait, let me compute the exact days.

August 20 to August 31: 12 days.

September: 30 days.

October 1-5: 5 days.

So total 12+30+5 =47 days.

But if the discount is on August 20, then the period from August 20 to October 5 is 47 days.

But when you discount a bill, the time starts from the next day. So the period is 46 days.

Wait, perhaps that's where I went wrong earlier. Let's think: if today is August 20, and the bill is due on October 5, the time remaining is 46 days because we don't count today as part of the period. So for discounting, the period is 46 days.

So, using 46 days:

discount = 3500 * 0.065 * (46/360) = ?

46/360 = 0.12777778.

0.065 * 0.12777778 ≈ 0.00833333.

3500 * 0.00833333 ≈ 29.16666.

Proceeds before fees: 3500 - 29.16666 ≈ 3470.8333.

Then, subtract the collection fee: 3500 * 0.00333333 ≈ 11.66666.

So total proceeds: 3470.8333 - 11.66666 ≈ 3459.1666.

But looking at the options, the closest is option D: $3450.00. But that's $9.16 less. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the fee calculation. Alternatively, maybe the collection fee is a flat fee, but the problem says it's (1/3)%, so it's a percentage of the face value.

Wait, the options are:

A: 3400

B:29.94

C:3650

D:3450

E:3550

F:3575

G:3605

H:3500

I:3625

J:3563.04

Hmm, none of these are around 3459.16. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the interest on the draft is 6%, so the face value might have accrued interest up to the discount date. Or perhaps the interest is added to the face value.

Wait, the draft is accepted by Parker Bros, meaning they have to pay it when due. But they discount it, so perhaps the face value includes interest up to the due date. Wait, the draft has interest at 6%, so the face value is 3500, but when discounted, the interest from April 5 to August 20 would have been accrued. Wait, no, because the discounting is happening before the due date, so the interest is only up to the discount date.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the interest from April 5 to August 20, add that to the face value, and then discount the total.

Wait, but the problem states that the draft is accepted for $3500 bearing interest at 6%, so the $3500 is the principal, and the interest would be calculated from April 5 to the due date (October 5). But when discounting on August 20, the interest up to that point would be part of the consideration.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the interest from April 5 to August 20, which is 4 months and 15 days, or more accurately, 138 days (from April 5 to August 20: April has 30 days, so 30-5=25 days in April, May 31, June 30, July 31, and August 20. 25+31=56, +30=86, +31=117, +20=137 days. So 137 days.

Wait, but 137 days is from April 5 to August 20.

Wait, let me calculate that accurately.

April 5 to April 30: 25 days.

May:31

June:30

July:31

August 1-20:20 days.

So 25+31=56, +30=86, +31=117, +20=137 days.

So 137 days.

So the interest from April 5 to August 20 is 137 days.

Then, the interest would be 3500 * 6% * (137/360).

Which is 3500 * 0.06 * (137/360).

0.06 * 137 = 8.22

8.22 /360 ≈ 0.0228333.

3500 * 0.0228333 ≈ 79.91666.

So the interest up to August 20 is about $79.92.

So the total amount due on August 20 would be 3500 + 79.92 = 3579.92.

Wait, but that can't be right because the draft isn't due until October 5. So perhaps when discounting, the interest from April 5 to August 20 is not added because the draft hasn't matured yet. Hmmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps the discounting process only considers the time from the discount date to the due date, which is 46 days. So the interest on the draft is irrelevant until maturity. The discount is calculated based on the discount rate and the time remaining.

So, going back, I think the correct approach is:

Proceeds = (Face value) × (1 - discount rate × time) - collection fee.

Wait, but perhaps the formula is:

Proceeds = Face value × (1 - discount rate × time) - (collection fee).

So, let's compute.

discount =
