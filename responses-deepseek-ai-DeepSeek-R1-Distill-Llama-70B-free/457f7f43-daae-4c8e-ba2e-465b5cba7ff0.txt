Okay, so I've got this problem about Comet Halley's orbit around the sun. The question gives me the distances at perihelion and aphelion, and I need to find the orbital period in terms of X times 10^9 seconds. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on orbital mechanics, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, right, I remember Kepler's laws. The third one relates the orbital period to the size of the orbit. Oh yeah, Kepler's third law states that the square of the period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the orbit. But wait, in this case, the orbit is around the sun, so we should use the version of the law that applies to our solar system, right?

So the formula is usually written as P² = (4π²/GM) * a³, where a is the semi-major axis, G is the gravitational constant, and M is the mass of the sun. But maybe there's a more convenient version when using astronomical units and years, but given that the answer is in seconds, I probably need to stick with SI units here.

Wait, but the data given is in kilometers, and the period is in seconds. So let's plan out the steps:

1. Calculate the semi-major axis (a) from the perihelion and aphelion distances.
2. Use Kepler's third law to find the period P.

Right, the semi-major axis is the average of the perihelion and aphelion distances. Wait no, that's only true for an ellipse. Oh wait, the perihelion is the closest point (r_p) and aphelion is the farthest (r_a). So the semi-major axis a is (r_p + r_a)/2. That makes sense.

So let me write down the given values:

r_p = 8.75e7 km = 8.75e10 meters (since 1 km is 1e3 meters, so 1e7 km is 1e10 meters)
r_a = 5.26e9 km = 5.26e12 meters.

Wait wait, wait a second. Let me make sure I convert correctly. 1 km is 1e3 meters, so 8.75e7 km is 8.75e7 * 1e3 = 8.75e10 meters. Similarly, 5.26e9 km is 5.26e9 *1e3 =5.26e12 meters.

So a = (r_p + r_a)/2 = (8.75e10 + 5.26e12)/2. Let me compute that.

Wait, computing 8.75e10 +5.26e12. Hmm, 5.26e12 is larger. Let me see: 8.75e10 is 0.0875e12, so adding 5.26e12 gives 5.3475e12. Then divide by 2: a= (5.3475e12)/2 = 2.67375e12 meters. So a is approximately 2.67375e12 meters.

Wait, let me double-check the addition. 8.75e10 is 87,500,000,000 m, and 5.26e12 is 5,260,000,000,000 m. Adding them gives 5,260,000,000,000 + 87,500,000,000 = 5,347,500,000,000 m. Divide by two gives 2,673,750,000,000 m, which is 2.67375e12 m. Yep, that's correct.

Now, with a known, I can plug into Kepler's third law. The formula is P² = (4π² * a³) / (G*M), where G is the gravitational constant and M is the mass of the sun.

I remember the values for G and M. G is approximately 6.6743e-11 m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻². M, the mass of the sun, is about 1.9885e30 kg.

So plugging the numbers in:

P² = (4 * π² * (2.67375e12)^3) / (6.6743e-11 * 1.9885e30)

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute a³: (2.67375e12)^3.

Hmm, 2.67375e12 cubed is (2.67375)^3 times (1e12)^3.

2.67375^3: Let's compute that. 2.67375 is close to 2.674.

2.674 * 2.674 = ?

2 * 2.674 = 5.348, 0.674 *2.674 ≈ let's compute 0.6 *2.674=1.6044, 0.074 *2.674≈0.198, so total ≈1.6044+0.198=1.8024. So 5.348 +1.8024=7.1504. Then multiply by 2.674 again: 7.1504 *2.674.

Let me compute 7 *2.674=18.718, 0.1504 *2.674≈0.1504*2=0.3008, 0.1504*0.674≈≈0.1013. So total ≈0.3008+0.1013=0.4021. So total is 18.718 +0.4021=19.1201. So 2.67375^3 ≈19.12 approx. So a³ ≈19.12e36 (since (1e12)^3=1e36). So 19.12e36 m³.

Wait no, wait: 1e12 cubed is 1e36, yes. So a³ is 19.12e36 m³.

Now, compute 4π²: π is about 3.1416, so π²≈9.8696, 4π²≈39.4784.

So numerator is 39.4784 *19.12e36 = let's compute that.

39.4784 *19.12 ≈ let's see:

39 *19 = 741, 39 *0.12=4.68, 0.4784*19≈9.079, 0.4784*0.12≈0.0574. So adding all approx:

741 +4.68=745.68, 9.079+0.0574≈9.1364. So total is about 745.68 +9.1364 =754.8164. So approximately 754.8164e36 m³.

Wait, wait, no: 39.4784 *19.12e36 = 39.4784 *19.12 = let me compute that more accurately.

39.4784 *19.12:

Let me compute 39.4784 * 19 = ?

39 *19 = 741, 0.4784 *19 ≈9.079. So 741 +9.079=750.079.

Now 39.4784 *0.12 = 4.737408.

So total is 750.079 +4.737408=754.8164.

So numerator is 754.8164e36 m³.

Denominator is G*M: 6.6743e-11 *1.9885e30.

Let me compute that. 6.6743e-11 *1.9885e30 = (6.6743 *1.9885) *1e19. Because 1e-11 *1e30=1e19.

6.6743 *1.9885: Let me compute that.

Approximate 6.6743 *2=13.3486, subtract 6.6743 *0.0115 (since 2-0.0115=1.9885). Hmm, perhaps better to compute directly.

6 *1.9885=11.931, 0.6743*1.9885≈ let's compute 0.6*1.9885=1.1931, 0.0743*1.9885≈0.1477. So total ≈1.1931 +0.1477=1.3408. So total 11.931+1.3408=13.2718. So approximately 13.2718e19.

So denominator is 13.2718e19 m³/(s² kg) * kg? Wait, no, G is m³ kg⁻¹ s⁻², M is kg, so G*M is m³ s⁻².

Wait, no. G is 6.67e-11 m³/(kg s²), M is kg, so G*M is m³/s².

So numerator is (39.4784 *a³) = 754.8164e36 m³.

Denominator is 6.6743e-11 *1.9885e30 = let me recalculate more accurately.

6.6743e-11 *1.9885e30 = (6.6743 *1.9885) *1e(-11+30) )= 13.2718e19 = 1.32718e20.

Wait, no: 6.6743 *1.9885 is approximately 13.27, and since exponents are 1e-11 and 1e30, multiply to get 1e19. So 13.27e19, which is 1.327e20.

So denominator is 1.327e20.

So P² = (754.8164e36) / (1.327e20) ) = (754.8164 /1.327) *1e(36-20) )= (approx) 569.1 *1e16 = 5.691e18.

Wait, let me compute 754.8164 /1.327.

Well, 1.327 * 569 = let's see: 1.3 *569= 739.7, 0.027 *569≈15.363, so total ≈755. So 754.8164 /1.327≈569.

So P²=569 *1e16 =5.69e18 s².

Then P is sqrt(5.69e18) s.

sqrt(5.69e18)=sqrt(5.69)*1e9.

sqrt(5.69) is approx 2.385, because 2.385^2=5.69.

So P≈2.385e9 seconds.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation of 754.8164 /1.327. Let me compute 754.8164 divided by 1.327.

Let me do it step by step.

1.327 * 500 = 663.5
1.327 * 570 = 1.327*(500+70)=663.5 + 92.89=756.39.

Wait, but 1.327 *570=756.39, which is larger than 754.8164.

So 570 would give 756.39, which is 1.57 more than 754.8164.

Wait, perhaps 569 times 1.327.

1.327 * 500 =663.5

1.327 * 69: let's compute 1.327*70=92.89, minus 1.327=92.89-1.327=91.563.

So 1.327 *569=663.5 +91.563=755.063.

But our numerator is 754.8164, which is 755.063 -0.2466.

So 569 - (0.2466 /1.327) ≈569 -0.186 approx 568.814.

So approximately 568.814.

So P²= (568.814) *1e16 →5.688e18.

Then P = sqrt(5.688e18)= approx sqrt(5.688)*1e9.

sqrt(5.688)= approx 2.385 (since 2.385^2=5.686). So about 2.385e9 seconds.

Wait, but the options are X where P=Xe9 s. So X is approximately 2.385. Looking at the options, let me check the letters:

Options are A:1.63, B:5.67, C:1.92, D:4.78, E:3.45, F:2.75, G:3.86, H:4.22, I:6.01, J:2.38.

So J is 2.38, which is very close to my calculation of 2.385.

Wait, but I approximated a few steps. Let me see if perhaps I made an error in the calculation.

Wait, let's recheck the calculation of a.

r_p is 8.75e7 km =8.75e10 m, r_a=5.26e9 km=5.26e12 m.

a=(8.75e10 +5.26e12)/2 = (5.26e12 +0.0875e12)/2 =5.3475e12/2=2.67375e12 m. That's correct.

a³ is (2.67375e12)^3= (2.67375)^3 *1e36.

2.67375^3: Let's compute it more accurately.

2.67375 *2.67375 = ?

Compute 2.67 *2.67 first.

2.67^2 =7.1289.

But more accurately:

2.67375 *2.67375:

Let me compute it step by step.

= (2 + 0.67375)^2 = 4 + 2*(2)(0.67375) + (0.67375)^2.

Wait, no, that's (a + b)^2 where a=2, b=0.67375.

So 2^2 + 2*2*0.67375 + (0.67375)^2.

=4 + 2.695 + (approx 0.4538).

So 4 +2.695=6.695, +0.4538=7.1488.

Now multiply this by 2.67375 to get the cube.

So 7.1488 *2.67375.

Let me compute this accurately:

7 *2.67375=18.71625

0.1488 *2.67375:

Compute 0.1 *2.67375=0.267375

0.04 *2.67375=0.10695

0.0088 *2.67375≈0.0235.

Add: 0.267375 +0.10695=0.374325 +0.0235≈0.397825.

So 18.71625 +0.397825≈19.114075.

So a³≈19.114075e36 m³.

Then 4π² a³ is 4*(9.8696)*19.114075e36 = 39.4784 *19.114075e36.

Compute 39.4784 *19.114075:

Approximately, 39.4784 *19 =750. Let's compute more precisely.

39.4784 *19 = ?

39 *19=741, 0.4784 *19=9.0996 → total 741+9.0996=750.0996.

39.4784 *0.114075≈ let's compute 39.4784 *0.1=3.94784, 39.4784 *0.014075≈0.556.

So total ≈3.94784 +0.556≈4.50384.

So total is 750.0996 +4.50384≈754.60344.

So 4π² a³ ≈754.60344e36 m³.

Denominator is G*M=6.6743e-11 *1.9885e30.

Compute 6.6743 *1.9885:

6 *1.9885 =11.931, 0.6743 *1.9885.

Compute 0.6 *1.9885=1.1931, 0.0743 *1.9885≈approx 0.1477.

So 0.6743 *1.9885≈1.1931 +0.1477=1.3408.

So total 11.931 +1.3408=13.2718.

So G*M=13.2718e19 m³/s².

So P² = numerator / denominator = (754.60344e36) / (13.2718e19) )= (754.60344/13.2718 )e17.

Wait, because 1e36 /1e19=1e17.

Compute 754.60344 /13.2718.

Let me compute 13.2718 *56 =744. So 56 *13.2718=744.0 (since 56*13=728, 56*0.2718≈15.22 → total 743.22). So 56 gives about 743.22, which is less than 754.6.

Difference is 754.6-743.22≈11.38.

So 11.38 /13.2718 ≈0.857.

So total is about 56.857.

Wait, 13.2718 *56.857 ≈?

Wait, 13.2718 *56 =744.0 (approx as before), 13.2718 *0.857 ≈11.39.

So 744 +11.39≈755.39, which is a bit above the numerator (754.60344). So perhaps 56.857 is a little high.

Alternatively, perhaps 56.8.

Wait, let me compute 13.2718 *56.8.

13 *56.8=737.2, 0.2718 *56.8≈15.43. So total 737.2+15.43=752.63.

So 13.2718 *56.8=752.63.

Our numerator is 754.60344.

So 754.60344-752.63=1.97344.

So how much more is needed beyond 56.8?

1.97344 /13.2718 ≈0.1488.

So total is 56.8 +0.1488≈56.9488.

So approximately 56.9488.

So P²=56.9488e17 =5.69488e18 s².

Then P= sqrt(5.69488e18) = sqrt(5.69488)*1e9
