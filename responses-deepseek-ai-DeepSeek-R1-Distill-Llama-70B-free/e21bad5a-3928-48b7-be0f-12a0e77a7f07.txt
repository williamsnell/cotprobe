Question:

A 4-year-old boy is brought to the physician because of temperatures to 39.4°C (102.9°F) for 8 days.

F: Intravenous corticosteroids
G: Intravenous prednisone
H: Intravenous immune globulin
I: Oral isoniazid
J: Intravenous vancomycin

Okay, so I've got this question here about a 4-year-old boy with some symptoms, and I need to figure out the correct treatment. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The boy has a high fever, 39.4°C, which is pretty high, and it's lasted for 8 days. That's a long time, so it's not just a simple cold or flu. The physical exam findings are anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, which means swollen lymph nodes in the front of the neck. Then there's nonexudative conjunctivitis in both eyes. Nonexudative means there's no pus, so it's more like red, dry eyes maybe. He also has a strawberry tongue, which I think is when the tongue looks red and swollen with little bumps, kind of like a strawberry. 

There's an erythematous truncal rash, so that's a red rash on the trunk of the body. And edema of the hands and feet, which is swelling. Hmm, putting this all together, what could this be?

I remember that Kawasaki disease has similar symptoms. Let me recall: Kawasaki is an acute febrile illness in children, typically under 5, with fever for more than 5 days. The main features include bilateral nonexudative conjunctivitis, cervical lymphadenopathy, changes in the mouth like strawberry tongue, erythema of the hands and feet, and a rash. The rash can vary but is often on the trunk.

So this seems to fit Kawasaki disease. Now, the question is about the appropriate pharmacotherapy to prevent complications. I remember that the main complication of Kawasaki is coronary artery aneurysms, so treatment is aimed at preventing that.

The standard treatment is intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). I think it's given early in the course of the disease. Sometimes they also use aspirin, but I think that's more for the fever and inflammation. Wait, but isn't aspirin used in the acute phase as well? Or is it just IVIG and then low-dose aspirin for antiplatelet effects after the fever subsides?

I should think about the options. Let's look at the choices:

A: IV penicillin. That's an antibiotic, but Kawasaki isn't caused by bacteria, so that's probably not right.

B: Oral amoxicillin. Also an antibiotic, same reasoning.

C: Oral aspirin. Aspirin is used sometimes, but I think it's in combination with IVIG or maybe not the primary treatment anymore. Wait, I remember that high-dose aspirin was used before but now IVIG is the mainstay. But sometimes they still use aspirin for its anti-inflammatory effects.

D: Oral ibuprofen. That's a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). But again, not the primary treatment for Kawasaki.

E: IV azithromycin. That's an antibiotic, so probably not relevant here.

F: IV corticosteroids. I think steroids are not the first-line treatment for Kawasaki. They might be used in some cases but not the main choice.

G: IV prednisone. Again, a steroid, same as F.

H: IV immune globulin. That's IVIG, which I thought was the main treatment to prevent coronary artery issues.

I: Oral isoniazid. That's for tuberculosis, not related here.

J: IV vancomycin. Another antibiotic, so probably not.

So the correct answer should be H: IV immune globulin.

Wait, but I thought sometimes aspirin is used alongside. Oh right, the initial treatment is IVIG, and sometimes they give aspirin during the acute phase for fever and inflammation. But the question is about preventing complications, which IVIG does by reducing the risk of coronary artery aneurysms. So the most appropriate is H.

Another thought: Are there any other possibilities? Could it be Scarlet fever? No, because Scarlet fever has a rash that's more like sandpaper, and it's caused by streptococcus, treated with antibiotics. The symptoms here don't fit as well, especially the strawberry tongue and the rash description.

So I think the answer is H.

The 4-year-old boy presents with symptoms consistent with Kawasaki disease, including a high fever lasting over 8 days, anterior cervical lymphadenopathy, nonexudative conjunctivitis, strawberry tongue, erythematous truncal rash, and edema of the hands and feet. Kawasaki disease is an acute febrile illness in children, and its primary complication is the development of coronary artery aneurysms. The standard treatment to prevent this complication is intravenous immune globulin (IVIG), which has been shown to reduce the risk of coronary artery abnormalities when administered early in the course of the disease.

Among the options provided:

- **A, B, E, I, J**: These are antibiotics, which are not appropriate since Kawasaki disease is not caused by a bacterial infection.
- **C, D**: Aspirin and ibuprofen are anti-inflammatory agents; while aspirin may sometimes be used for fever management, it is not the primary treatment to prevent complications.
- **F, G**: Corticosteroids are not first-line therapy for Kawasaki disease.
- **H**: IVIG is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy to prevent complications of Kawasaki disease.

Thus, the correct answer is **H: Intravenous immune globulin**.
