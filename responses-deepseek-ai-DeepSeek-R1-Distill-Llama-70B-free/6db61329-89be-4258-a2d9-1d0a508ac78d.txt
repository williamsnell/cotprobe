Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the photoelectric effect and ionization energy. Hmm, I remember that the photoelectric effect involves electrons being ejected from a material when light shines on it. The key equation I think is Einstein's photoelectric equation, which is something like the energy of the incoming photon equals the work function (which is the ionization energy here) plus the kinetic energy of the ejected electron.

The problem gives me the wavelength of the ultraviolet radiation, which is 58.4 nm. Oh wait, I should convert that to meters because the units in physics equations are usually in meters, kilograms, seconds, etc. So 58.4 nm is 58.4e-9 meters. Right, because 1 nm is 1e-9 m.

I need to find the energy of the photon. The energy E of a photon is given by E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant and c is the speed of light. I remember h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s and c is about 3.0e8 m/s. Let me calculate that. 

So E = (6.626e-34 J·s) * (3.0e8 m/s) / (58.4e-9 m). Let me compute the numerator first: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Then divide by 58.4e-9 m: 1.9878e-25 / 58.4e-9 = approximately 3.405e-17 J. Hmm, but wait, maybe I should be more precise with the numbers to avoid errors.

Wait, let me compute it step by step again. 6.626e-34 * 3e8 is 1.9878e-25. Then, 58.4e-9 is 5.84e-8. So dividing 1.9878e-25 by 5.84e-8 gives (1.9878 / 5.84) * 1e-17. 1.9878 divided by 5.84 is approximately 0.3405. So E ≈ 0.3405e-17 J, which is 3.405e-18 J? Wait, no, wait, wait. Wait 1e-25 divided by 1e-8 is 1e-17. So yes, 3.405e-17 J? No, wait, because 1e-25 / 1e-8 is 1e-17. So the 1.9878e-25 divided by 5.84e-8 is (1.9878 /5.84) * (1e-25 / 1e-8) ) which is (0.3405) * 1e-17, so 3.405e-18 J? Wait, no, 1e-25 /1e-8 is 1e-17. So 1.9878e-25 /5.84e-8 = (1.9878/5.84) * (1e-25 / 1e-8) )= 0.3405 * 1e-17 = 3.405e-18 J? Wait that doesn't seem right. Wait, 1e-25 /1e-8 is 1e-17, so 1.9878e-25 /5.84e-8 is (1.9878 /5.84) * 1e-17. 1.9878/5.84 is about 0.3405, so 0.3405 * 1e-17 = 3.405e-18 J? Or wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the exponent. Let me compute the exponents again.

Wait, no. Let me think again. 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Then divided by λ which is 58.4e-9 m, so 1.9878e-25 /58.4e-9 = 1.9878e-25 /5.84e-8. So 1.9878 /5.84 is ~0.3405, and 1e-25 /1e-8 is 1e-17. So 0.3405e-17, which is 3.405e-18 J. So that's the photon energy.

But wait, I'm getting a bit confused with the exponents. Let me compute 6.626e-34 *3e8 first. 6e-34 *3e8 is 18e-26, which is 1.8e-25. But 6.626 is a bit more precise, so 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 6.626 *3 = 19.878e-26, which is 1.9878e-25 J·m. Then, divided by 58.4e-9 m: E= (1.9878e-25) / (58.4e-9) = (1.9878/58.4) * 1e-16 J? Wait, because 1e-25 /1e-9 is 1e-16, right? So 1.9878e-25 /58.4e-9 = (1.9878 /58.4) * 1e-16. Let me compute 1.9878 /58.4. 1.9878 divided by 58.4 is approximately 0.03405. So 0.03405 *1e-16 J is 3.405e-18 J. So E≈3.405e-18 J.

Now, the next part is the kinetic energy of the ejected electron. The problem gives the speed as 1.59e6 m/s. The kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². The mass of the electron is about 9.11e-31 kg. So KE = 0.5 *9.11e-31 kg * (1.59e6 m/s)^2.

Let me compute that. (1.59e6)^2 is (approx 2.528e12). So 0.5 *9.11e-31 *2.528e12 = 0.5 * (9.11e-31 *2.528e12) = 0.5 * (approx 2.3e-18) )= 1.15e-18 J.

Wait let me compute it more accurately. 

First, (1.59e6)^2 = (1.59)^2 * 1e12. 1.59^2 is about 2.5281, so 2.5281e12.

Then, 9.11e-31 kg multiplied by 2.5281e12 (m²/s²) gives 9.11e-31 *2.5281e12 = let's compute 9.11 *2.5281 ≈ 23.02, and the exponents: 1e-31 *1e12 = 1e-19. So 23.02e-19 = 2.3022e-18 J. Then multiply by 0.5 (since KE is 1/2 mv²), so 1.151e-18 J.

So the kinetic energy is approximately 1.151e-18 J.

Now, according to Einstein's equation: Energy of photon = Work function (ionization energy) + Kinetic energy.

So Work function φ = E_photon - KE.

E_photon is 3.405e-18 J, KE is 1.151e-18 J.

So φ = 3.405e-18 -1.151e-18 = 2.254e-18 J.

Now I need to convert this energy from Joules to electron volts (eV) because the answer options are in eV. I remember that 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So to convert J to eV, I divide by 1.602e-19.

So φ in eV is (2.254e-18 J) / (1.602e-19 J/eV) ≈ let's compute that.

2.254e-18 /1.602e-19 = (2.254 /1.602) * 10^( -18 +19 ) = approx 1.407 *10^1 = 14.07 eV.

Wait, but let me calculate 2.254 divided by 1.602 precisely. 

1.602 times 14 is 22.428, which is more than 22.54. Wait, wait, no, wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait 1.602 *14 = 22.428, but 2.254 is 2.254, not 22.54. Wait no, wait. Oh, no, wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, 2.254 /1.602. Let me compute that. 

1.602 * 1 = 1.602; 1.602 * 1.4 = 1.602 *1 +1.602 *0.4 = 1.602 + 0.6408 = 2.2428. Hmm, that's very close to 2.254. So 1.4 times 1.602 is 2.2428. The difference between 2.254 and 2.2428 is 0.0112. So to find how much more than 1.4 it is, 0.0112 /1.602 ≈ 0.007. So approximately 1.407. So 1.407 * 10^1 is 14.07 eV. So about 14.1 eV.

Looking at the options, option C is 14 eV. So that's the answer. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I make mistakes with exponents or units.

Wait, let me recheck the initial photon energy calculation. Let me compute h*c/λ again. h=6.626e-34, c=3e8 m/s, λ=58.4e-9 m.

So h*c=6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Divide by λ: 1.9878e-25 /58.4e-9 = 1.9878e-25 /5.84e-8 = (1.9878 /5.84) *1e-17.

1.9878 /5.84 is approximately 0.3405, so 0.3405e-17 J = 3.405e-18 J. That's correct.

Then the KE: (1/2)mv².

m=9.11e-31 kg, v=1.59e6 m/s.

v squared is (1.59e6)^2 = 2.528e12 m²/s².

So KE = 0.5 *9.11e-31 *2.528e12.

0.5 *9.11e-31 =4.555e-31.

4.555e-31 *2.528e12 = Let's compute 4.555 *2.528 ≈ 11.51, and exponents: 1e-31 *1e12 =1e-19. So 11.51e-19 is 1.151e-18 J.

So E_photon = 3.405e-18 J.

So φ = 3.405e-18 - 1.151e-18 = 2.254e-18 J.

Convert to eV: 2.254e-18 /1.602e-19 = (2.254 /1.602 ) *10^( -18 +19 )= (approx 1.407) *10^1 =14.07 eV.

So the closest option is C:14 eV.

To calculate the ionization energy of krypton, we use the photoelectric effect and Einstein's equation:

\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \phi + KE
\]

where \( E_{\text{photon}} \) is the energy of the incident photon, \( \phi \) is the work function (ionization energy), and \( KE \) is the kinetic energy of the ejected electron.

### Step 1: Calculate the energy of the photon
The energy of a photon is given by:

\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

Here:
- \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) (Planck's constant),
- \( c = 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) (speed of light),
- \( \lambda = 58.4 \, \text{nm} = 58.4 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} \).

Substituting:

\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34})(3.0 \times 10^8)}{58.4 \times 10^{-9}}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
6.626 \times 10^{-34} \times 3.0 \times 10^8 = 1.9878 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J·m}
\]

Now divide by \( \lambda \):

\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25}}{58.4 \times 10^{-9}} = 3.405 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}
\]

Thus, the energy of the photon is approximately \( 3.405 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J} \).

### Step 2: Calculate the kinetic energy of the electron
The kinetic energy of the electron is given by:

\[
KE = \frac{1}{2} m v^2
\]

Here:
- \( m = 9.11 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg} \) (mass of the electron),
- \( v = 1.59 \times 10^6 \, \text{m/s} \) (speed of the electron).

Substituting:

\[
KE = \frac{1}{2} (9.11 \times 10^{-31}) (1.59 \times 10^6)^2
\]

First, calculate \( v^2 \):

\[
(1.59 \times 10^6)^2 = 2.528 \times 10^{12} \, \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2
\]

Now calculate \( KE \):

\[
KE = \frac{1}{2} (9.11 \times 10^{-31}) (2.528 \times 10^{12}) = 1.151 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}
\]

Thus, the kinetic energy of the electron is approximately \( 1.151 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J} \).

### Step 3: Calculate the ionization energy
Using Einstein's equation:

\[
\phi = E_{\text{photon}} - KE
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\phi = 3.405 \times 10^{-18} - 1.151 \times 10^{-18} = 2.254 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}
\]

Convert \( \phi \) to electron volts (1 eV = \( 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \)):

\[
\phi = \frac{2.254 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 14.07 \, \text{eV}
\]

### Final Answer:
The ionization energy of krypton is approximately **14 eV**, which corresponds to option **C**.
