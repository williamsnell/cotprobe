Okay, so I'm trying to solve this electric field problem. Let me read it again. There are two particles, each with a charge of 12 nC, placed at two vertices of an equilateral triangle. The edge length is 2.0 meters. I need to find the electric field at the third vertex. Both charges are positive.

Hmm, I remember that the electric field due to a point charge is given by Coulomb's law. The formula is E = kQ / r², where k is Coulomb's constant, Q is the charge, and r is the distance from the charge.

Since the triangle is equilateral, all sides are equal, so each side is 2.0 meters. That means each charge is 2.0 m away from the third vertex. Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait. Wait, the two charges are at two vertices, so the third vertex is the point where I'm calculating the field. So the distance from each charge to the third point is 2.0 m because all sides are equal.

But wait, wait, no. Because in a triangle, each vertex is connected by edges. If the charges are at two vertices, the third vertex is opposite, but in an equilateral triangle, the distances between any two vertices are the same. So each charge is 2.0 m away from the third vertex. So each charge contributes equally to the electric field at that point.

But wait, wait a second. Because electric field is a vector. So I can't just add them directly if they are in the same direction. But in this case, the two charges are both positive, so the electric field vectors would point away from each charge. But wait, the third vertex is a point where the fields are coming from the two charges. So let me visualize this.

Imagine an equilateral triangle. Let's say the charges are at points A and B, and the third vertex is point C. So the electric field at point C due to charge A is E_A, and due to charge B is E_B. Since both charges are positive, the field at C from A would point away from A, which would be towards the direction from C to A, but wait, actually, no. Because if the charge is at A, the electric field at C would be pointing away from A. Hmm, wait, no, the direction of the electric field due to a positive charge is away from it. So if the charge is at A, the field at C would point in the direction from A to C, but wait, no. Wait, no, the field at C would point away from A. So the direction is from A to C? Wait, no, wait. Wait, the electric field vector at a point due to a positive charge points away from that charge. So if the charge is at A, then at point C, the field E_A is pointing away from A. Since A is a vertex, the direction from A to C is from A to the opposite point, but in an equilateral triangle, the position of C relative to A and B depends on the exact arrangement.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me think about the symmetry. The two charges are at two vertices of an equilateral triangle. So the third vertex is such that the angle at that point between the two charges is 60 degrees. Because in an equilateral triangle, each angle is 60 degrees.

Wait, no. Wait, the angle at point C (where we're calculating the field) is 60 degrees. Because in an equilateral triangle, all internal angles are 60 degrees. So from point C, the lines to points A and B form a 60-degree angle.

Wait, but the fields from A and B at point C. Since both charges are positive, the fields point away from A and away from B. So the field from A at C points in the direction from A to C, and the field from B at C points from B to C. Wait, no, no, wait. Wait, the field at C due to A is pointing away from A. So if A is at one corner, the field at C would point in the direction from A to C. Similarly, the field due to B at C points from B to C.

Wait, no. Wait, that's not correct. Let's imagine point C is the third vertex, and A and B are the other two. So the charges are at A and B. The electric field at C due to A is a vector pointing away from A. Since A and C are 2.0 m apart, the direction is from A to C, which would be towards the direction opposite to A from C's perspective. Wait, perhaps I'm getting this wrong. Let me clarify.

Wait, the electric field at a point due to a positive charge is a vector that points directly away from the charge. So if the charge is at A, then at point C, the electric field vector E_A would point in the direction from A to C. Because from C's perspective, the charge at A is pushing it away, so the field at C due to A is in the direction away from A. So in terms of the triangle, if A is one vertex, and C is another, the field vector E_A would be pointing from A towards C, meaning that from C's point of view, the field is coming from A's direction. Wait, no, no, wait. No, wait: the direction of E is away from the positive charge. So if the charge is at A, then the field at C is in the direction from A to C. Because positive charges create fields that emanate outward. So from A's position, the field lines go outward in all directions. So at point C, which is 2 m away from A, the field points from A to C.

Wait, no. Wait, that's not correct. The electric field at point C due to charge A is a vector that points away from A. So if you imagine a positive charge at A, the field lines go radially outward. So at point C, the field vector E_A points in the direction from A to C. Similarly, E_B, the field from charge B at C, points from B to C.

Wait, so E_A and E_B are both vectors pointing away from their respective charges. So in the triangle, if A and B are two vertices, and C is the third, then the vectors E_A and E_B would form a 60-degree angle between them because the angle at C is 60 degrees in the equilateral triangle.

Wait, no. Let's think about the geometry. In an equilateral triangle, each internal angle is 60 degrees. So the angle between vectors E_A and E_B at point C is 60 degrees. So when adding the two vectors, we can use the law of cosines because they are at 60 degrees to each other.

So each of the electric fields E_A and E_B has the same magnitude. Because both charges are 12 nC, and the distance from each to C is the same (2.0 m). So E_A = E_B = kQ / r².

Let me compute E_A first. k is Coulomb's constant, approximately 8.988×10^9 N·m²/C². Q is 12 nC, which is 12×10^-9 C. r is 2.0 m.

So E = (8.988e9) * (12e-9) / (2.0)^2.

Calculating that: numerator is 8.988e9 * 12e-9 = 8.988 * 12 = let's compute 8 *12 =96, 0.988*12≈11.856, total≈107.856.

Then denominator is 4. So 107.856 /4 = 26.964 N/C. So each field is approximately 26.964 N/C.

Now, since both E_A and E_B are vectors pointing away from their respective charges, they are each at 60 degrees to each other. Wait, no: because from point C, the angle between the directions to A and B is 60 degrees. So the angle between E_A and E_B is 60 degrees.

Wait, no, wait. The angle between E_A and E_B is the angle at point C between the two directions. Since the triangle is equilateral, that angle is 60 degrees. But E_A is pointing from A to C, and E_B is pointing from B to C. So at point C, the vectors E_A and E_B are both pointing towards C? No, wait, no. Because the electric field vectors point away from the positive charges. So E_A is pointing from A to C, and E_B is pointing from B to C. So the angle between E_A and E_B at point C is 60 degrees, because the angle at C in the triangle is 60 degrees.

Wait, perhaps a better way to think about it is to draw the triangle. Let's say point C is the top vertex, and points A and B are at the base, forming an equilateral triangle. So the angle at C is 60 degrees. The field vectors E_A and E_B at C would point towards C, but wait, no, because E_A is due to A, a positive charge, so E_A points away from A. Since A is at the base, the direction of E_A at C would be towards the upper left, and E_B towards the upper right, each making a 60-degree angle with each other.

Wait, maybe I'm not visualizing this correctly. Alternatively, perhaps the angle between E_A and E_B is 60 degrees. Because the lines from A to C and B to C form a 60-degree angle at C. So the vectors E_A and E_B are each pointing away from A and B, respectively, and at point C, those vectors are at a 60-degree angle relative to each other.

So, to find the total electric field E_total, we can use vector addition. Since both E_A and E_B are the same magnitude and the angle between them is 60 degrees, the magnitude of the resultant vector can be found using the formula:

E_total² = E_A² + E_B² + 2 * E_A * E_B * cos(theta)

Where theta is the angle between them, which is 60 degrees.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait, the formula for the magnitude of the sum of two vectors is sqrt(E1² + E2² + 2 E1 E2 cos(theta)), where theta is the angle between them. So since theta is 60 degrees, cos(theta) is 0.5.

So plugging in, E_total² = (26.964)^2 + (26.964)^2 + 2*(26.964)*(26.964)*0.5.

Let me compute that:

First, compute 26.964 squared: 26.964 *26.964 ≈ let's approximate 27^2 is 729, but 26.964 is slightly less, so say 26.964^2 ≈ 727. So 727 +727 = 1454.

Then the third term is 2 * (26.964)^2 *0.5. The 2 and 0.5 cancel each other, so it's just (26.964)^2, which is 727.

So E_total squared is 1454 + 727 = 2181.

So E_total is sqrt(2181) ≈ let's see, 46^2 is 2116, 47^2=2209. So sqrt(2181) is between 46 and 47. Let me compute 46.7^2: 46^2=2116, 0.7^2=0.49, 2*46*0.7=64.4. So 2116 +64.4 +0.49= 2180.89. Oh, that's very close to 2181. So sqrt(2181) ≈46.7 N/C.

Wait, but wait a minute. Let me check my calculation again. Because when I compute E_total² as (E_A)^2 + (E_B)^2 + 2*E_A*E_B*cos(theta), because theta is 60 degrees, that's correct.

Alternatively, let me redo the math more accurately.

E_A = E_B = 26.964 N/C.

E_total² = (26.964)^2 + (26.964)^2 + 2*(26.964)*(26.964)*cos(60°)

cos(60) is 0.5.

So E_total² = 2*(26.964)^2 + 2*(26.964)^2 * 0.5

Wait, no: 2*E_A*E_B*cos(theta) is 2*(26.964)^2 *0.5, because E_A = E_B.

So 2*(26.964)^2 *0.5 = (26.964)^2.

So E_total² = (26.964)^2 + (26.964)^2 + (26.964)^2 = 3*(26.964)^2.

Wait wait, no. Wait, 2*E_A*E_B*cos(theta) is 2*(E_A)^2 *0.5 because E_A = E_B.

So 2*(E_A)^2 *0.5 = (E_A)^2.

So the total E_total² is (E_A)^2 + (E_B)^2 + (E_A)^2 = 3*(E_A)^2.

Wait, that can't be right because in the initial approach I thought the angle was 60 degrees, so the formula would be sum of squares plus 2ab cos(theta). So I think I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let me re-calculate properly.

Each E is 26.964 N/C.

The angle between them is 60 degrees.

So E_total² = E_A² + E_B² + 2*E_A*E_B*cos(60°)

Which is 26.964² +26.964² + 2*(26.964)*(26.964)*(0.5)

Which simplifies to 2*(26.964²) + (26.964²) = 3*(26.964²)

So E_total = 26.964 * sqrt(3) ≈26.964 * 1.732 ≈ let's compute that.

26.964 *1.732 ≈ let me compute 27 *1.732 first.

27 *1.732 = 46.764.

But since 26.964 is 27 minus 0.036, so 26.964 *1.732 = 46.764 - (0.036 *1.732) ≈46.764 -0.0623≈46.7017 N/C.

So approximately 46.7 N/C.

Looking at the options, option G is 47 N/C. So that's very close.

But wait, wait. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the calculation.

Wait, another approach: since the two fields are at 60 degrees, the resultant can be found using vector components.

Let me model the vectors as E_A and E_B each with magnitude E, and angle 60 degrees between them.

So, E_Ax = E * cos(theta1), E_Ay = E * sin(theta1)

Similarly, E_Bx = E * cos(theta2), E_B_y = E * sin(theta2)

But since the angle between them is 60 degrees, perhaps it's easier to place them symmetrically along the axes.

Alternatively, let's place E_A along the positive x-axis, so E_Ax = E, E_Ay = 0.

Then E_B makes a 60-degree angle with E_A, so E_Bx = E * cos(60) = E * 0.5, E_By = E * sin(60) = E*(√3/2).

So the total Ex is E + 0.5 E = 1.5 E.

The total Ey is 0 + (√3/2 E) = (√3/2) E.

Then the magnitude of E_total is sqrt( (1.5 E)^2 + ( (√3/2 E) )^2 )

Compute that:

(1.5 E)^2 = (3/2 E)^2 = 9/4 E²

(√3/2 E)^2 = (3/4) E²

So total: (9/4 + 3/4) E² = 12/4 E² = 3 E²

So E_total = sqrt(3 E²) = E * sqrt(3) ≈ E * 1.732.

Which is the same as before. So E_total is E*sqrt(3), which is 26.964 * 1.732 ≈46.7 N/C.

So the closest option is G:47 N/C.

Wait, but wait. Let me check my initial calculation of E.

E = kQ / r².

k is 8.988e9 N·m²/C².

Q is 12e-9 C.

r is 2.0 m.

So E = (8.988e9) * (12e-9) / (2^2)

Compute numerator: 8.988e9 * 12e-9 = 8.988 *12 = 107.856.

Denominator:4.

So E =107.856 /4 =26.964 N/C. Correct.

So E_total =26.964 * sqrt(3) ≈26.964 *1.732 ≈46.7 N/C.

So the answer is G:47 N/C.
</think>

To solve the problem, we calculate the electric field at the third vertex of an equilateral triangle due to two positive charges, each with a magnitude of \( Q = 12 \, \mathrm{nC} \), placed at the other two vertices. The side length of the triangle is \( r = 2.0 \, \mathrm{m} \).

### Step 1: Electric field due to a single charge
The electric field due to a point charge is given by Coulomb's law:
\[
E = \frac{kQ}{r^2}
\]
where \( k = 8.988 \times 10^9 \, \mathrm{N \cdot m^2 / C^2} \), \( Q = 12 \, \mathrm{nC} = 12 \times 10^{-9} \, \mathrm{C} \), and \( r = 2.0 \, \mathrm{m} \).

Substituting the values:
\[
E = \frac{(8.988 \times 10^9)(12 \times 10^{-9})}{2.0^2} = \frac{107.856}{4} = 26.964 \, \mathrm{N/C}
\]

Thus, the electric field at the third vertex due to each charge is \( E_A = E_B = 26.964 \, \mathrm{N/C} \).

### Step 2: Angle between the electric field vectors
Since the triangle is equilateral, the angle between the two electric field vectors at the third vertex is \( \theta = 60^\circ \).
