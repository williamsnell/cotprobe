Okay, so I have this problem about a clutch and I'm supposed to find the frictional torque and the axial force. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

The question gives me a one plate clutch where both sides contribute to torque. The coefficient of friction is 0.35, and the maximum permissible pressure is 20 psi. The diameters are 20 inches inside and 24 inches outside.

Wait, right, torque in a clutch is usually calculated based on the friction between the plates. Since both sides of the plate are contributing, I think that affects the total torque. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, the torque comes from the frictional force, which depends on the pressure applied. 

So, I remember the formula for torque is T = (μ * F * r_mean), but wait, maybe it's more about the area involved. Or perhaps the torque is calculated as the integral of the frictional force around the radius. Oh, right, for a clutch with radii r1 and r2, the mean radius is (r1 + r2)/2, but wait, no, maybe it's the radius where the pressure is applied. Hmm, wait, I might be mixing things up.

Wait, actually, I think the standard formula for torque when both sides contribute is T = (2/3) * μ * P * (R^3 - r^3)/(R^2 - r^2), but wait, no, that's for a cone clutch maybe. Or perhaps it's for a disc clutch with uniform wear or uniform pressure.

Wait, another approach: The torque is the sum of the frictional forces multiplied by their respective radii. The frictional force on each side is μ * P * area, but wait, no, because the pressure is given, maybe it's the axial force that's related to the pressure and area.

Wait, let's clarify. The axial force (F_axial) is the force applied to clamp the plates together. The maximum permissible pressure is given as 20 psi. So the axial force can be found by multiplying this pressure by the area of the frictional surfaces.

But wait, the problem states that both sides of the plate deliver torque. So for a single plate, there are two frictional surfaces, right? So the total area would be twice the area between the inner and outer diameters.

Wait, no, the area for each side is the area of the annulus (the ring-shaped region). So the area for one side is π(R² - r²), where R is outer radius and r is inner radius. Since both sides are active, the total area is 2 * π(R² - r²).

Wait no, wait. Wait, for a one plate clutch, there are two frictional surfaces. So each side is an annulus, so each has area π(R² - r²), so two sides would have 2π(R² - r²).

But the axial force F is the pressure multiplied by the total area. Because pressure is force per unit area, so F = pressure × area. So the axial force would be F = P * 2π(R² - r²).

Wait, and then the torque... Torque is the sum of each frictional force times the radius at which it's applied. But since the pressure is uniform, the torque can be calculated using the formula T = (2/3) * μ * F * (R² + r²)/(R² - r²). Wait, maybe I'm mixing up the formula.

Alternatively, I think the torque for a single plate clutch is T = μ * F * r_mean, where r_mean is the mean radius. Wait, but how is that calculated?

Wait, another approach: The torque is the integral over the area of the frictional force times the radius. So for each infinitesimal ring at radius x, the area is 2πx dx, and the force on it is μ * P * 2πx dx (since both sides contribute, so 2 times the single side). Then the torque contributed by that ring is μ * P * 2πx dx * x (because torque is force times radius). So integrating from r to R.

So the torque T would be μ * P * 2π ∫ (x² dx) from r to R.

The integral of x² dx from r to R is (R³ - r³)/3. So T = μ * P * 2π * (R³ - r³)/3.

Wait, that makes sense. Let me write that formula down:

T = (2π/3) * μ * P * (R³ - r³)

And the axial force F_axial is P * 2π(R² - r²), because the area is 2π(R² - r²) as both sides are contributing.

Wait, but let me make sure. Because the pressure is applied over the area, so F_axial = pressure * area. The area for both sides is 2 * area of one side (the annulus). So area A = 2 * π (R² - r²). Therefore, F_axial = P * A = P * 2π(R² - r²).

So, given that, I can plug in the numbers.

First, convert the diameters to radii. The inside diameter is 20 inches, so r = 10 inches. Outside diameter is 24 inches, so R = 12 inches.

Given P = 20 psi.

So, let's compute F_axial first.

F_axial = 20 psi * 2 * π * (12² - 10²)

Compute 12² = 144, 10²=100. 144-100=44. So 2 * π * 44 = 88π. Then F_axial = 20 * 88π.

Compute 20 * 88 = 1760. So 1760π lbs. Let's compute that numerically.

Wait, but the options are in lbs. So 1760π is approximately 1760 * 3.1416 ≈ 1760 * 3.1416. Let me compute that:

1760 * 3 = 5280

1760 * 0.1416 ≈ 1760 * 0.14 = 246.4, 1760 * 0.0016≈2.816.

So 246.4 + 2.816 ≈ 249.216. So total F_axial ≈ 5280 + 249.216 ≈ 5529.216 lbs? But looking at the options, the axial forces are like 2513, 2900, etc. Hmm, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, wait. Wait a second. Oh no! Wait, perhaps I doubled the area incorrectly. Because maybe the area is just the annulus area once, not twice. Because the pressure is the same on both sides, perhaps the area is just calculated once.

Wait, let me think again. The clutch has one plate, and both sides are active. So the total area in contact is two times the annulus area. So yes, area A = 2 * π(R² - r²). So the calculation I did earlier would be correct. But according to that, F_axial is 20 * 2π(R² - r²) = 20 * 88π ≈ 20 * 275.78 ≈ 5515.6 lbs. But none of the options have this value. Hmm, the options for axial force are around 2500-3000 lbs.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me re-calculate.

Compute R = 12 inches, r =10 inches.

R² - r² = 144 - 100 = 44.

So area A = 2 * π * 44 = 88π.

F_axial = P * A = 20 psi * 88π in². Wait, but psi is pounds per square inch. So 20 lb/in² * 88π in² = 20 * 88π lb.

Wait, 88π is approximately 88 * 3.1416 ≈ 276. The 20 * 276 = 5520 lb. That's about 5520 lbs. But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding something.

Wait, maybe the pressure is applied on one side only, so the area is only π(R² - r²). Then F_axial would be 20 * π * 44 = 20 * 138.23... Wait, 44π is approximately 138.23, so 20 * 138.23 ≈ 2765 lbs. Oh, that's one of the options. Let me check the options.

Looking back: Option H has 21,346 lbs-in and 2765 lbs. Option G has 10,673 and 2765. So perhaps I was wrong about considering both sides, maybe the area is only one annulus. So let's think again.

Wait, the pressure is applied across the entire area. So if the plate is pressed against another plate, the pressure on each side is the same, so the total force is P multiplied by the area of one side. Because the same pressure is applied to both surfaces, but each contributes to the same force. Hmm, maybe the area is just the annulus once. Because the total force would be P times the area of one side, not two.

Wait, that makes sense. Because when you press two plates together, the pressure on each face is the same, so the total force is P times the area of one face. So perhaps I was wrong earlier, and the correct area is just π(R² - r²), not multiplied by two.

So let me recalculate F_axial as P * π(R² - r²) = 20 * π * (144 - 100) = 20 * π * 44.

So 44π ≈ 138.23, 20 * 138.23 ≈ 2765.5 lbs. That matches the 2765 in options G and H.

So F_axial is approximately 2765 lbs.

Wait, but then the torque calculation. Let me see.

So torque T is given by the frictional force multiplied by the radius. But since it's an annulus, the mean radius might be considered. Alternatively, using the formula T = (2/3) μ P (R³ - r³).

Wait, let me think about the torque calculation again. The torque arises from the frictional force, which is μ multiplied by the normal force. The normal force is F_axial, which we've calculated as 2765 lbs.

So T = μ * F_axial * r_mean, where r_mean is the mean effective radius. Or perhaps the formula is T = μ * F_axial * (R² + r²)/(R + r) ) / 2. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, I remember that for a uniform pressure distribution, the torque can be calculated as T = (2/3) μ P (R³ - r³). Let me try that.

Wait, but wait, in that formula, P is pressure, and the area is considered in the calculation. Let me make sure.

Alternatively, considering that the total frictional torque is the integral of (μ P 2π r dr) * r, integrated from r = r_inner to r_outer. Because each ring at radius r has area 2π r dr (since both sides?), but wait, no, the area element for one side is 2π r dr. So the total frictional force on that ring is μ P (2π r dr). Then the torque is that multiplied by r, so dT = μ P (2π r dr) * r = 2π μ P r² dr.

Integrating from r_inner to r_outer:

T = 2π μ P ∫ r² dr from r to R.

Which is 2π μ P [ R³/3 - r³/3 ] = (2π μ P / 3)(R³ - r³).

So T = (2π μ P (R³ - r³ )) /3.

So let's plug in the numbers.

μ = 0.35

P = 20 psi.

R = 12 inches, r =10 inches.

Compute R³ = 12^3 = 1728.

r³ = 10^3 = 1000.

R³ - r³ = 1728 - 1000 = 728.

So T = (2 * π * 0.35 * 20 * 728 ) /3.

Compute numerator: 2 * π ≈6.2832. 6.2832 * 0.35 ≈ 2.19912. 2.19912 * 20 =43.9824. 43.9824 * 728 = ?

Wait, let's compute 43.9824 * 700 = 30,787.68. 43.9824 *28 = approx 1,231.47. So total is 30,787.68 + 1,231.47 ≈ 32,019.15.

Then divide by 3: 32,019.15 /3 ≈ 10,673 lbs-in.

Wait, that's one of the options. Option G is 10,673 lbs-in, 2765 lbs. Option H is 21,346 lbs-in, 2765 lbs.

So, according to this, T ≈10,673 and F_axial ≈2765, which matches option G.

But wait, I thought the torque was higher. Let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, let me compute again:

R =12, r=10.

R³ = 1728, r³=1000. So R³ - r³=728.

(2π * μ * P * (R³ - r³)) /3.

So 2 * π is about 6.2832.

Multiply by μ (0.35): 6.2832 * 0.35 ≈ 2.199.

Multiply by P (20): 2.199 *20 =43.98.

Multiply by (R³ - r³) =728: 43.98 *728.

Let me compute 43.98 *700=30,786.

43.98 *28 = 43.98 *20=879.6, 43.98*8=351.84. So 879.6+351.84=1231.44.

Total: 30,786 +1231.44=32,017.44.

Divide by 3: 32,017.44 /3 ≈10,672.48, which is approximately 10,673 lbs-in.

So torque is ~10,673 lbs-in, and axial force is ~2765 lbs. So the correct option is G: 10,673 lbs-in, 2765 lbs.

Wait, but in the options, option H has torque 21,346 and same F_axial. Why the discrepancy?

Ah, perhaps I made a mistake in the torque formula. Wait, perhaps the formula should not have the 2π factor. Because the frictional force is μ * P * area, but the area for each ring is 2πr dr (since both sides, so 2 times the area of one side). But when calculating torque, each ring contributes μ * P * 2πr dr * r.

Wait, but when I integrated, I used 2π μ P r² dr, which sums to (2π μ P /3)(R³ - r³). So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula should be T = μ * F_axial * (R² + r²)/(2(R² - r²)) * (R - r) ?

Wait, I'm confusing different formulas. Let me think again.

Wait, F_axial is P * area. The area is π(R² - r²) if considering one side. So F_axial = P * π (R² - r²).

Then, the torque T is μ * F_axial * (R² + r²)/(2(R)).

Wait, no, I think the mean radius is (R + r)/2. So torque would be μ * F_axial * (R + r)/2.

Let me try that approach.

F_axial = P * π (R² - r²) = 20 * π (144 -100) = 20 * π *44 ≈ 20 * 138.23 ≈2765.5 lbs.

Then T = μ * F_axial * (R + r)/2.

R + r =12 +10=22. So (22)/2=11 inches.

So T =0.35 * 2765.5 *11.

Compute 0.35 *2765.5 first.

0.35 *2765.5: 0.3 *2765.5=829.65, 0.05*2765.5=138.275. So sum is 829.65 +138.275=967.925.

Then multiply by 11: 967.925 *11=10,647.175 lbs-in.

That's approximately 10,647, which rounds to 10,647 or 10,673 as in option G.

So this method gives about 10,647, which is close to option G's 10,673.

So the correct answer seems to be option G: torque 10,673 lbs-in and axial force 2765 lbs.

Looking back at the options:

Option G: 10,673 lbs.-in., 2765 lbs.

Yes, that matches.
</think>

To evaluate the frictional torque and axial force for the given one plate clutch, we start by analyzing the problem parameters:

- **Coefficient of friction**: \( \mu = 0.35 \)
- **Maximum permissible pressure**: \( P = 20 \, \text{psi} \)
- **Inner diameter**: \( d_{\text{inner}} = 20 \, \text{in} \), so \( r = 10 \, \text{in} \)
- **Outer diameter**: \( d_{\text{outer}} = 24 \, \text{in} \), so \( R = 12 \, \text{in} \)

### Axial Force Calculation
The axial force \( F_{\text{axial}} \) is calculated using the formula:
\[
F_{\text{axial}} = P \cdot A
\]
where \( A \) is the total frictional area. Since the clutch has one plate with both sides contributing, the area is twice the annulus area:
\[
A = 2 \cdot \pi (R^2 - r^2)
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
A = 2 \cdot \pi (12^2 - 10^2) = 2 \cdot \pi (144 - 100) = 2 \cdot \pi \cdot 44 = 88\pi
\]
Thus:
\[
F_{\text{axial}} = 20 \cdot 88\pi = 1760\pi \, \text{lbs}
\]
Approximating \( \pi \approx 3.1416 \):
