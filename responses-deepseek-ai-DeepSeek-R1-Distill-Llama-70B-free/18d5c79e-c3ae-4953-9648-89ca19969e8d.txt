Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with these kinds of questions. But I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the question is about a stone being dropped into a well, and then the splash is heard two seconds later. We need to find the depth of the well. The options are from A to J, all in feet.

Hmm, let's think. I remember that when you drop something into a well, two things happen: the stone falls, taking some time, and then the sound travels back up. The total time for both is given as two seconds. But wait, the problem says the splash is heard two seconds later. So that two seconds includes both the time it takes for the stone to fall and the time for the sound to come back up.

Wait, no, actually, wait. When the stone is dropped, it falls to the water, which takes time t1. Then the sound travels back up the well, which takes time t2. So the total time from dropping until hearing the splash is t1 + t2 = 2 seconds.

So, to find the depth of the well, I need to calculate both the time it takes for the stone to hit the water and the time for the sound to return, then sum those times to two seconds.

I think the formula for the distance the stone falls is based on the equations of motion under gravity. Assuming no air resistance, the distance fallen is (1/2)gt², where g is acceleration due to gravity. But wait, what's g in feet units? Because the options are in feet and the sound speed is given in ft/s.

Right, I remember that g is approximately 32 ft/s². So the equation would be d = 0.5 * 32 * t1², which simplifies to d = 16 t1².

Then, the sound travels the same distance back up. The speed of sound is given as 1100 ft/sec, so the time it takes for the sound to come back is d divided by speed, which is t2 = d / 1100.

So we have two equations:

1. d = 16 t1²
2. t2 = d / 1100

And the sum of t1 and t2 is 2 seconds:

t1 + t2 = 2.

So substituting equation 2 into the sum equation:

t1 + (16 t1²) / 1100 = 2.

Hmm, that's a quadratic equation. Let me write that out.

Let me rearrange the equation:

(16 t1²)/1100 + t1 - 2 = 0.

To make it simpler, maybe multiply all terms by 1100 to eliminate the denominator:

16 t1² + 1100 t1 - 2200 = 0.

Wait, let me check that. 1100 * t1 is 1100 t1, and 1100*(-2) is -2200. So yes, that's correct.

So the equation is 16 t1² + 1100 t1 - 2200 = 0.

Wait, that seems a bit complicated. Let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in substitution.

Wait, the sum is t1 + t2 = 2. And t2 is d/1100, which is (16 t1²)/1100. So t1 + (16 t1²)/1100 = 2.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to let d = 16 t1² and d = 1100 t2.

Since d is the same, 16 t1² = 1100 t2.

And t1 + t2 = 2.

So substituting t2 = (16 t1²)/1100 into the sum equation:

t1 + (16 t1²)/1100 = 2.

Hmm, same as before. So perhaps it's easier to substitute t2 = 2 - t1 into the equation.

So, d = 16 t1² and d = 1100 t2 = 1100 (2 - t1).

So,

16 t1² = 1100 (2 - t1).

Expanding that:

16 t1² = 2200 - 1100 t1.

Bringing all terms to one side:

16 t1² + 1100 t1 - 2200 = 0.

Wait, that's the same equation as before. Oh, right, same result.

Now, this is a quadratic equation in terms of t1: a t1² + b t1 + c = 0.

Where a = 16, b = 1100, c = -2200.

The quadratic formula is t1 = [-b ± sqrt(b² - 4ac)]/(2a).

Plugging in the values:

b² = (1100)^2 = 1,210,000.

4ac = 4 *16*(-2200) = 64 * (-2200) = -140,800.

So the discriminant is 1,210,000 - 4ac = 1,210,000 - (-140,800) = 1,350,800.

Wait, wait, no. The formula is sqrt(b² -4ac).

So 4ac is 4*16*(-2200) = 64*(-2200) = -140,800.

So b² -4ac = 1,210,000 - (-140,800) = 1,210,000 +140,800 = 1,350,800.

So sqrt(1,350,800). Let me compute that.

Hmm, sqrt(1,350,800). Let me see. 1163^2 is about 1,354,000 because 1163^2 = (1160+3)^2 = 1160^2 + 2*1160*3 +3^2 = 1,345,600 + 6,960 +9= 1,352,569. Hmm, wait, that's not matching up.

Wait, maybe I should just approximate. Let's see, 1,350,800 is about 1.3508e6. The square root of 1e6 is 1000, sqrt(1.21e6)=1100. So sqrt(1.3508e6) is somewhere around 1160. Let me compute 1160^2: 1,345,600. So 1,350,800 is 5,200 more. So 1160^2 is 1,345,600. 1161^2 is (1160+1)^2=1160² + 2*1160 +1=1,345,600 +2,320 +1=1,347,921. Still less than 1,350,800.

1162^2=1,347,921 + 2*1161 +1=1,347,921 +2322 +1=1,350,244.

Then 1163^2=1,350,244 +2*1162 +1=1,350,244 +2324 +1=1,352,569.

Wait, but our discriminant is 1,350,800. So between 1162 and 1163.

Wait, 1162^2=1,350,244, which is 556 less than 1,350,800.

So 1,350,800-1,350,244=556. So sqrt is approx 1162 + 556/(2*1162) )= 1162 + 556/2324 ≈ 1162 + 0.239≈ 1162.24 seconds? Wait, no, because it's per second squared. Wait, no, the units are correct because the equation is in terms of t1 in seconds.

Wait, no, sqrt(1,350,800) is approximately 1162.24.

So, back to the quadratic formula:

t1 = [-b ± sqrt(D)]/(2a) = [-1100 ± 1162.24 ]/(2*16).

We can ignore the negative root because time can't be negative. So:

t1 = [ -1100 + 1162.24 ] / 32.

That's (62.24)/32 ≈ 1.944 seconds.

Wait, that doesn't make sense because if t1 is about 1.944 seconds, then t2 would be 2 -1.944= 0.056 seconds. But then the depth d would be 16*(1.944)^2.

Wait, 1.944 squared is approximately 3.78. So 16*3.78≈60.48 feet. Then, the sound would take 60.48 / 1100 ≈ 0.055 seconds, which adds up to t1=1.944 + t2=0.055 ≈ 2 seconds, which fits.

Wait, but let me check the quadratic equation again because when I substituted, I might have made a mistake in signs.

Wait, the quadratic equation after moving everything to one side was 16 t1² + 1100 t1 -2200=0. So a=16, b=1100, c=-2200.

So the formula is t1 = [ -b ± sqrt(b² -4ac) ] / (2a).

So, substituting:

t1 = [ -1100 ± sqrt( (1100)^2 -4*16*(-2200) ) ] / (32).

Which becomes:

t1 = [ -1100 ± sqrt(1,210,000 +140,800) ] /32.

Wait, because 4ac is 4*16*(-2200) = -140,800, so -4ac becomes positive 140,800.

So sqrt(1,350,800) ≈ 1162.24.

So,

t1 = [ -1100 + 1162.24 ] /32 → (62.24)/32 ≈ 1.944 s.

Wait, but that's almost 2 seconds, but then the time for sound is t2=2-1.944=0.056 s. So the depth would be d=16 * (1.944)^2 ≈ 16 *3.78≈60.5 feet. Wait, but looking at the options, option J is 60.6 ft, which is close.

But wait, let me check my calculations again because the answer seems plausible, but maybe I made an error in the quadratic setup.

Wait, another approach. Maybe the time for the stone to fall is much less than 2 seconds, and the time for sound is the majority. But according to my calculation, the stone takes almost 2 seconds to fall, which seems a bit odd because if the stone takes 2 seconds to fall, then the well would be deeper than, say, 16*(2)^2=64 feet. But the sound only takes 0.056 seconds to travel that 64 feet, which would make sense as 64/1100≈0.058 seconds.

But in the options, 60.6 is an option, which is close to 60.48, which I got. So perhaps option J is correct.

Wait, but let me recompute the exact value without approximation to see if it's exactly 60.6.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation setup.

Another way: Let me define t as the time the stone takes to fall. Then the sound takes (2-t) seconds to travel up.

So the distance fallen by the stone is (1/2) g t².

Which is (1/2)*32*t²=16 t².

The sound's distance is 1100*(2 - t).

So 16 t² = 1100 (2 - t).

So 16 t² + 1100 t - 2200 =0.

Which is the same equation as before.

Using the quadratic formula:

t = [ -1100 ± sqrt(1100^2 +4*16*2200) ] / (2*16).

Wait, wait, 4ac is 4*16*(-2200)= -140,800. So in the discriminant, it's b² -4ac =1,210,000 +140,800=1,350,800.

So sqrt(1,350,800). Let me compute that more accurately.

Wait, 1162^2 is 1,350,244. 1,350,800-1,350,244=556.

So sqrt(1,350,800)=1162 + 556/(2*1162) )=1162 + 278/1162≈1162+0.239≈1162.24.

So t=( -1100 +1162.24 )/32 =62.24/32≈1.944 seconds.

So the depth is 16*(1.944)^2.

1.944 squared: let's calculate.

1.944 *1.944: 2*2=4, but let's compute accurately.

1.944^2 = (2 -0.056)^2 = 4 - 2*2*0.056 + (0.056)^2=4 -0.224 +0.003136≈3.779136.

So 16 *3.779136≈60.506. So approximately 60.5 feet. Looking at the options, J is 60.6 ft, which is very close.

So the answer should be J:60.6 ft.

Wait, but let me double-check everything because I feel like the time for the stone to fall is almost the entire 2 seconds, which seems a bit counterintuitive. Normally, the sound would take a noticeable time, but perhaps if the well is deep, that's possible.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if the units are correct. The problem gives sound speed in ft/s, so that's consistent. The acceleration is in ft/s², so that's correct.

Another way to approach is to assume that the time for the stone is much smaller than the total time. Wait, but in this case, according to the calculation, the stone takes about 1.944 seconds, which is almost 2 seconds, leaving only 0.056 seconds for the sound. So that would imply a deep well, but according to the calculation, that's correct.

Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the equation setup. Let me double-check.

The correct approach is that the time for the stone to fall is t1, and the time for sound is t2, with t1 + t2 =2.

The distance for the stone is d=16 t1².

The distance for sound is d=1100 t2.

So 16 t1² = 1100 t2.

But t2=2 - t1. So,

16 t1² =1100 (2 - t1).

Which expands to 16 t1² +1100 t1 -2200=0.

So the setup is correct.

Thus, the solution is t1≈1.944 s, and d≈60.5 ft, which matches option J:60.6 ft.

So I think the correct answer is J.
</think>

To determine the depth of the well, we analyze the situation where a stone is dropped, and the splash is heard 2 seconds later. The total time includes both the time for the stone to fall (\(t_1\)) and the time for the sound to travel back up (\(t_2\)), such that:

\[
t_1 + t_2 = 2 \, \text{seconds}.
\]

### Step 1: Equations for distance
1. The distance the stone falls is given by the equation of motion under gravity:
   \[
   d = 16 t_1^2,
   \]
   where \(d\) is the depth of the well and \(g = 32 \, \text{ft/s}^2\).

2. The sound travels the same distance back up at a speed of \(1100 \, \text{ft/s}\), so:
   \[
   t_2 = \frac{d}{1100}.
   \]

### Step 2: Relating \(t_1\) and \(t_2\)
From the total time equation:
\[
t_2 = 2 - t_1.
\]

Substituting \(t_2\) into the sound equation:
\[
\frac{d}{1100} = 2 - t_1.
\]

Since \(d = 16 t_1^2\), substitute \(d\) into the equation:
\[
16 t_1^2 = 1100 (2 - t_1).
\]

### Step 3: Solving the quadratic equation
Expanding and rearranging:
\[
16 t_1^2 + 1100 t_1 - 2200 = 0.
\]

This is a quadratic equation of the form \(a t_1^2 + b t_1 + c = 0\), where:
\[
a = 16, \, b = 1100, \, c = -2200.
\]

Using the quadratic formula:
\[
t_1 = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a},
\]
we calculate:
\[
b^2 - 4ac = 1100^2 - 4(16)(-2200) = 1,210,000 + 140,800 = 1,350,800,
\]
\[
\sqrt{1,350,800} \approx 1162.24.
\]

Substituting back:
\[
t_1 = \frac{-1100 + 1162.24}{32} = \frac{62.24}{32} \approx 1.944 \, \text{seconds}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculating the depth
Using \(d = 16 t_1^2\):
\[
d = 16 (1.944)^2 = 16 (3.78) \approx 60.5 \, \text{feet}.
\]

### Final Answer
The depth of the well is approximately \(60.6 \, \text{ft}\), which corresponds to option **J**.
