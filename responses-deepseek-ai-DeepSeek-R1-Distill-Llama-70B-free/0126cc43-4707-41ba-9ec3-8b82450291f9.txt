Okay, so I need to figure out how many different possible committees of 5 people can be chosen from a group of 15 people. Hmm, this sounds like a combination problem because the order in which we select the committee members doesn't matter. I remember that combinations are used when the order isn't important, unlike permutations where it is.

Wait, what's the formula for combinations again? Oh right, the formula is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose. So in this case, n is 15 and k is 5.

Let me plug in the numbers. So it's 15! divided by (5! times (15-5)! ), which simplifies to 15! / (5! * 10!). But calculating factorials for such large numbers might be a bit tricky. Oh wait, there's a way to simplify this without computing all the factorials.

I remember that 15! is 15 × 14 × 13 × 12 × 11 × 10! So when I write it out, the 10! in the numerator and denominator will cancel each other out. That leaves me with (15 × 14 × 13 × 12 × 11) / (5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1).

Let me compute the numerator first. 15 multiplied by 14 is 210. Then 210 multiplied by 13 is 2730. Next, 2730 multiplied by 12 is 32,760. And 32,760 multiplied by 11 gives 360,360. So the numerator is 360,360.

Now the denominator is 5 factorial, which is 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1. Let's compute that: 5×4 is 20, times 3 is 60, times 2 is 120, times 1 is still 120.

So now I divide the numerator by the denominator: 360,360 divided by 120. Let me do that division step by step. 120 goes into 360 three times (3×120=360), so that's 3. Bring down the 3, making it 3. 3 divided by 120 is 0, so maybe I should adjust. Wait, maybe I should compute 360360 ÷ 120.

Wait another approach: 360,360 ÷ 120. Let me factor out zeros first. Both numbers have two zeros at the end, so divide both by 100: that gives 3603.6 ÷ 1.2. Hmm, but maybe it's easier to see that 120 times 3000 is 360,000. So 3000 would give 360,000. Subtract that from 360,360, we have 360 left. 360 divided by 120 is 3. So 3000 + 3 = 3003. 

So the number of possible committees is 3003. Looking at the options, option A is 3,003. So the correct answer should be A.

To determine how many different possible committees of 5 people can be chosen from a group of 15 people, we use the combination formula:

\[
C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k! \cdot (n - k)!}
\]

Here, \( n = 15 \) and \( k = 5 \). Substituting these values:

\[
C(15, 5) = \frac{15!}{5! \cdot 10!}
\]

Simplifying further, we cancel out \( 10! \) from the numerator and denominator:

\[
C(15, 5) = \frac{15 \cdot 14 \cdot 13 \cdot 12 \cdot 11}{5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1}
\]

Calculating the numerator:

\[
15 \cdot 14 = 210, \quad 210 \cdot 13 = 2730, \quad 2730 \cdot 12 = 32760, \quad 32760 \cdot 11 = 360360
\]

Calculating the denominator:

\[
5 \cdot 4 = 20, \quad 20 \cdot 3 = 60, \quad 60 \cdot 2 = 120, \quad 120 \cdot 1 = 120
\]

Now, divide the numerator by the denominator:

\[
\frac{360360}{120} = 3003
\]

Thus, the number of different possible committees is **3,003**, which corresponds to option **A**.
