Okay, so I've got this problem here about an electric saw using a chain and sprockets. I'm a bit rusty on some of these mechanical calculations, but let's try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the problem says the saw uses a number 50 chain with a pitch of 5/8 inch. The sprockets involved are the smaller one with 18 teeth. We need to calculate the horsepower transmitted for two cases: when the smaller sprocket rotates at 1000 rpm and then at 2000 rpm.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with chains and sprockets, the speed of the chain is related to the rotational speed of the sprockets. Also, the power transmitted depends on the chain's speed and the tension in it, but wait, do I have enough information about the tension here? Maybe I'm missing something. Oh, perhaps the problem assumes a standard tension for a no. 50 chain. Or maybe there's a formula that relates these factors without explicitly needing the tension.

Wait, I think the formula for horsepower (HP) when dealing with chains and sprockets might involve the chain speed and the pitch. Let me recall. Oh right, the horsepower can be calculated using the formula:

HP = (Chain Speed in feet per minute * Tangential Force in pounds) / (33,000 * efficiency)

But wait, I don't have the tangential force here. Hmm. Alternatively, I think there's another approach where the power is determined based on the rotational speed and the sprocket sizes. Maybe I should find the speed of the chain first.

Chain speed is calculated based on the number of teeth on the sprocket, the pitch, and the rpm. The formula for chain speed (in feet per minute, fpm) is:

Chain Speed (fpm) = (rpm * Number of Teeth * Pitch (in inches)) / 12

Wait, because 12 inches make a foot, right. So that makes sense. Let me plug in the numbers for part (a) where the smaller sprocket is at 1000 rpm.

So for part (a):
rpm = 1000
Teeth = 18
Pitch = 5/8 inches = 0.625 in

Chain Speed = (1000 * 18 * 0.625) / 12

Let me compute that. 1000 * 18 is 18,000. 18,000 * 0.625 = 11,250. Divide by 12 gives 937.5 fpm.

Wait, but wait, I thought the chain speed formula is (rpm * teeth * pitch) / 12. That seems correct. So yes, 937.5 fpm.

Now, how do I get horsepower from that? Oh, I think there's a standard formula where horsepower is (chain speed in fpm * chain tension in pounds) divided by 33,000. But again, I don't have the chain tension. Hmm.

Wait a second, perhaps the problem is assuming that the chain is transmitting a certain amount of power based on a standard or given condition. Or maybe the power is related to the sprocket's rotational speed and the torque involved. Torque is force times radius, but without knowing the force, I'm stuck.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. I remember that for chain drives, the horsepower can be calculated using the formula:

HP = (rpm * P * N) / (33,000 * (1 - (D2/D1)))

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Or perhaps the product of the chain speed and some factor gives the horsepower. Maybe the formula is HP = (chain speed * (number of teeth)) / some constant. I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, perhaps there's a standard power formula for chains. Let me think. I think the formula for horsepower when using a chain drive is:

HP = ( (rpm * T1) / 100 ) * (P / 12)

Where T1 is the number of teeth on the smaller sprocket and P is the pitch in inches. Wait, but I'm not sure about this formula. Maybe I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, chain horsepower can be calculated by determining the power required to move the chain at a certain speed, which would involve the weight of the chain and the friction. But without knowing the chain's weight or the frictional losses, that approach seems difficult.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a key formula here. Let me think again. The standard formula for chain horsepower is often given as:

HP = (V * F) / 33,000

Where V is the chain velocity in feet per minute, and F is the difference in tension between the tight and slack sides of the chain in pounds. But again, without knowing F, this seems impossible.

Wait, perhaps the question assumes that the power is calculated based on some nominal values. Alternatively, maybe it's using the small sprocket's rotational speed and the chain's pitch to find the power without considering the tension. I'm not sure, but perhaps I can proceed with the data I have.

Wait, I think I've found another approach. The horsepower can be determined by the formula:

HP = ( (rpm) * (pitch) * (number of teeth) ) / ( 33,000 * 12 )

Wait, let me see. Let's plug in the numbers. For part (a):

rpm = 1000
pitch = 5/8 in = 0.625 in
teeth = 18

So HP = (1000 * 0.625 * 18) / (33,000 * 12 )

Compute numerator: 1000 * 0.625 = 625; 625 * 18 = 11,250.

Denominator: 33,000 * 12 = 396,000.

So HP = 11,250 / 396,000 = approx 0.0284 hp. But that's way too low, nothing like the options provided. So maybe this approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the formula I should be using is:

HP = ( (rpm * number of teeth * pitch) ) / ( (12 * 33,000) )

But that's the same as what I just did, giving 0.0284 hp, which doesn't match any options.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing a step here. Maybe the formula is HP = (chain speed in feet per minute * some constant). Let's compute chain speed again for part (a):

Chain speed = (1000 rpm * 18 teeth * 0.625 in) / 12 in/ft

That gives (1000 * 18 * 0.625) = 11,250. Divided by 12 is 937.5 feet per minute.

Now, perhaps the horsepower is calculated as (chain speed) / (some constant). Looking at the options, I wonder if the formula used is HP = (chain speed / 100), but 937.5/100 is 9.375, which isn't in the options. Alternatively, maybe HP = (chain speed / 60), which would be 15.625, which is close to option F (15.33 hp) but not exact. Wait, maybe it's chain speed divided by some factor like 66, because 937.5 / 66 is about 14.2, but that's not matching either.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing chain speed with another parameter. Alternatively, maybe the problem uses a different formula where the power is (rpm * teeth * pitch) / (33,000 * 12). Let me compute that for part (a):

(1000 * 18 * 0.625) / (33,000 * 12) = (11,250) / (396,000) ≈ 0.0284 hp. That's too low again.

This isn't adding up. Maybe the formula is different. Alternatively, perhaps the chain's power is determined by the product of the chain's speed and the number of teeth, divided by a constant.

Wait, another thought: maybe the problem is referring to the power transmitted based on the rotational speed and torque. Torque (T) is related to power (P) by P = (T * ω) / 5252, where ω is in radians per second. But without knowing the torque, I can't compute that. Unless I can find torque from the sprocket's teeth and chain's pitch. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses the small sprocket's rotational speed to find the torque, assuming a certain chain tension. But without knowing the tension, I'm stuck again.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses the formula for power in chains as HP = ( (rpm * P * T) ) / 33,000, where P is pitch and T is number of teeth. Let me try that.

For part (a): (1000 * 0.625 * 18) / 33,000 = (11,250) / 33,000 ≈ 0.3409 hp. That's still not matching any of the options.

Wait, maybe I'm using the wrong formula. Maybe the formula involves the chain's speed in feet per minute multiplied by the number of teeth, then divided by a constant. Let me try chain speed (937.5 fpm) * 18 teeth = 16,875. Then divide by 1000 to get 16.875 hp. Oh, that's close to option A's 16.33 hp. Hmmm.

Wait, but why would I multiply by the number of teeth again? That doesn't make much sense physically. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (chain speed * number of teeth) / (some constant). Let me think.

Chain speed is 937.5 fpm. If I multiply that by 18, I get 16,875. Then, perhaps I divide by 1000, giving 16.875 hp. That's around 16.88, which is close to 16.33 in option A, but not exact. Alternatively, maybe the formula is (chain speed * 0.5) divided by something.

Wait, another approach: I think I've heard that 1000 feet per minute of chain speed is roughly equivalent to 1 horsepower when using a certain size of chain. So for a no. 50 chain, maybe the factor is different. Let me look that up in my mind. Oh wait, I'm just trying to think. I think the formula is HP = (V * W) / (33,000), where V is the chain speed in fpm, and W is the chain's weight per foot in pounds. But without knowing W, this approach isn't helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a standard horsepower per 1000 rpm for a given chain size. For example, a no. 50 chain might transmit X horsepower at 1000 rpm. But I don't remember the exact values.

Wait, maybe the problem is using a standard formula where the horsepower is (rpm * number of teeth) / (1720 * pitch). Let me try that. For part (a), (1000 * 18) / (1720 * 0.625). Wait, 1720 is approximately the number of feet per minute for 1000 rpm on a 1-inch pitch sprocket with a certain number of teeth. Not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is HP = (rpm * number of teeth * pitch) / (1720). Let me calculate that:

For part (a): (1000 * 18 * 0.625) / 1720 ≈ 11,250 / 1720 ≈ 6.544 hp. That's not matching any options either.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about the relationship between the sprockets. Wait, the problem mentions sprockets, but only gives the number of teeth on the smaller one (18 teeth). Oh, but maybe the other sprocket's size affects the speed ratio. However, the question is about the power transmitted, which depends on the product of torque and speed. But since the sprockets are connected by the chain, the power should be the same on both sprockets, assuming no losses. So maybe I don't need the larger sprocket's teeth count here.

Wait, another thought: the problem gives the pitch as 5/8 inch, which is 0.625 inches. The number 50 chain has a certain roller diameter, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

Wait, perhaps the formula for horsepower is (rpm * chain speed constant). Let's say chain speed is in fpm, and multiply by a factor to get horsepower. For example, 937.5 fpm times 0.0175 gives around 16.44 hp. Hmm, that's close to option A's 16.33 hp.

Wait, 0.0175 is approximately 1/57. So 937.5 / 57 ≈ 16.44. That's close to 16.33, which is option A's first value. So maybe the formula is HP = chain speed / 57.

But why 57? Where does that number come from? Maybe it's a standard conversion factor considering the chain's weight or some other property. Alternatively, perhaps the factor includes the chain's efficiency or other losses.

Wait, for part (a), 937.5 / 57 ≈ 16.44 hp, which is near 16.33 hp, option A. For part (b), the rpm is 2000, so the chain speed would be (2000 * 18 * 0.625) / 12 = (22,500) / 12 = 1875 fpm. Then, 1875 / 57 ≈ 32.89 hp. But wait, looking at the options, option A for part (b) is 14.966 hp, which is much lower. So that can't be right.

Hmm, so perhaps my assumption about the formula being chain speed divided by 57 is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe it's chain speed divided by 100, but 937.5 / 100 is 9.375, which isn't matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the formula is HP = (chain speed * 0.5). For part (a), 937.5 * 0.5 = 468.75, which is way too high. That can't be.

Wait, maybe the formula involves the number of teeth and the pitch in a different way. Let me think about the power formula again. Maybe it's HP = (rpm * number of teeth * pitch) / (33,000 * 12). Let me try that again.

For part (a): (1000 * 18 * 0.625) = 11,250. Divided by (33,000 * 12) = 396,000. So 11,250 / 396,000 ≈ 0.0284 hp. That's way too low, which doesn't align with any options.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a factor of 100 somewhere. Let me try multiplying by 100. So 0.0284 * 100 = 2.84 hp. Still not matching any options.

I'm starting to think that maybe I'm using the wrong approach entirely. Perhaps the problem is referring to the power transmitted based on the sprocket's rotational speed and the torque it's applying. Torque can be calculated as Torque = (Power * 5252) / rpm. But again, without knowing the power, that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the problem uses the formula for power in terms of the chain's linear speed and the force applied. Let's say F is the force in pounds, and V is the chain speed in feet per minute. Then HP = (F * V) / 33,000. But again, without F, this is tricky.

Wait, perhaps the force F is related to the sprocket's number of teeth and the chain's pitch. Oh, but how? I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the force is derived from the torque on the sprocket. Torque is force times radius, so F = Torque / radius. But without knowing Torque or radius, that's not helpful.

Hmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should consider that the options are in the range of 7-16 hp, so perhaps the correct approach gives higher values. Let's try another angle.

Another formula I found (in my mind) is HP = (rpm * P * N) / (229.25), where P is pitch in inches and N is number of teeth. Let me try that for part (a):

HP = (1000 * 0.625 * 18) / 229.25 = (11,250) / 229.25 ≈ 49.13 hp. That's way too high, not matching any options.

Wait, perhaps the denominator is different. Maybe it's 229.25 times 10 or something. Let me try dividing 11,250 by 2292.5: 11,250 / 2292.5 ≈ 4.91 hp. Still not matching.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is (rpm * P * N) / (229.25 * 100). So 11,250 / (229.25 * 100) ≈ 0.0491 hp. No, too low again.

I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should think about the relationship between the sprockets and the chain. The smaller sprocket has 18 teeth, and the chain pitch is 5/8 in. So the chain speed is as I calculated before, 937.5 fpm for part (a).

Wait, another approach: perhaps the power is determined by the product of the chain's speed and the number of teeth, divided by a constant. So for part (a), that's 937.5 * 18 = 16,875. Divided by 1000, that's 16.875 hp, which is close to option A's 16.33 hp. Maybe there's a slight adjustment, like an efficiency factor.

Similarly, for part (b), the rpm is 2000, so chain speed is (2000 * 18 * 0.625) /12 = (22,500)/12 = 1875 fpm. Then, 1875 * 18 = 33,750. Divided by 1000 is 33.75 hp. But looking at the options, option A's second value is 14.966 hp. That's half of what I just got. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should divide by 2, because the power is transmitted to both sprockets. No, but the question is about the power transmitted, so it should be the same on both sprockets. So that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I'm miscalculating. Let me recompute for part (b). Chain speed is 1875 fpm. Multiply by 18 teeth gives 33,750. Divide by 1000 to get 33.75 hp. But the options don't have this value. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (chain speed * number of teeth) / (1000 * something). Let me try (937.5 * 18) / (1000 * 1.12) ≈
