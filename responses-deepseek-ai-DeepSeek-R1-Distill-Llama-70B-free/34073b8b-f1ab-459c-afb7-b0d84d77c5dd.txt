Question:

On his 21st birthday, a son enlisted in the army. As he was about to leave for eight weeks of basic training, his father said, "I will buy you a new car at the end of basic training if you promise me not to take illegal drugs or drink alcohol while at basic training. " The son replied, "You can order the new car right away. I promise not to take illegal drugs or drink alcohol, as you requested. "At the end of basic training, the son was given a leave and returned home. His father asked, "Did you abide by your promise not to take illegal drugs or drink alcohol?" The son replied, "Yes, Father. " The father then told the son that he had already ordered the new car and that it would be available for delivery within one month. One week later, the son received the tragic news that his father had died suddenly. At the funeral, the executor of the father's estate told the son that he did not feel compelled to give the son the newly arrived car. In a suit against the executor of the father's estate to recover the new car, the son will

Options:

A: not succeed, because the father's death nullifies his promise.
B: not succeed, because the father's promise was void.
C: not succeed, because the executor of the estate has the final say.
D: not succeed, because the son's promise did not constitute a legal contract.
E: succeed, because the son's promise to refrain from drinking alcohol provided sufficient consideration.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about contract law, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The scenario is about a son and his father. On the son's 21st birthday, he enlists in the army and is about to leave for basic training. The father offers to buy him a new car if he promises not to take illegal drugs or drink alcohol during training. The son agrees and promises. At the end of training, when the son returns, the father confirms the promise was kept and says he's already ordered the car, which will be delivered in a month. But then the father dies suddenly, and the executor of the estate tells the son he doesn't feel compelled to give him the car. The son sues the executor. The question is whether the son will succeed in getting the car.

Hmm, so the key here is to determine if there's an enforceable contract between the son and the father. Contracts require offer, acceptance, and consideration. Let's break it down.

The father's offer was to buy a car in exchange for the son not using drugs or drinking. The son accepted by promising to refrain. So, is that a valid contract?

Wait, the son's promise to not drink or do drugs—does that count as consideration? Consideration is something of value given in exchange for a promise. But in this case, the son is promising to refrain from certain behaviors. Normally, forbearance can be consideration if it's a legal right being surrendered. But wait, drinking and doing drugs are illegal, so the son wasn't giving up a legal right. He wasn't allowed to do those things anyway. So, maybe his promise doesn't count as valid consideration.

Alternatively, sometimes a promise to do something you're already legally bound to do isn't consideration. For example, if someone promises not to commit a crime in exchange for something, that's not consideration because they're already required by law to abstain.

In this case, the son is 21, so drinking might be legal (assuming the drinking age is 21), but illegal drugs are, well, illegal regardless. So, if the son is 21, he can legally drink, but he's promising not to. So, in that case, maybe his promise to not drink is a valid consideration because he's giving up a legal right (to drink) for the father's promise to buy the car.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused here. Let me think again. The father's promise is to buy the car if the son doesn't drink or do drugs. The son agrees. So, the consideration would be the son's forbearance from drinking (if he was allowed) and not doing drugs. But if the son is 21, he can legally drink, so his promise to not drink would be giving up a legal right, which is good consideration. However, for the drugs, it's illegal, so he can't give up an illegal activity as consideration because it's not a legal right.

But wait, the promise is to not do both—so maybe the consideration is the part about not drinking, which he can legally do. That might be sufficient.

Alternatively, some might argue that the son's promise is a mere promise without any consideration because the father was asking him to do something that's already his moral obligation or something a parent might expect. But I don't think that's the case legally; moral obligations don't negate the need for consideration.

Another angle: the father's promise was a gift conditioned on the son's behavior. If the son fulfilled the condition, the gift would be given. But is that a contract or a gift promise? If the father's promise was a unilateral contract, where the offer is to exchange a promise for an action, then the son's action (refraining) is the acceptance. But if it's a unilateral contract, the consideration is the action.

Wait, but unilateral contracts require that the action is both the acceptance and the consideration. So, if the father said, "If you don't drink or do drugs, I'll buy you a car," and the son then refrains, that's acceptance through performance. So, the consideration would be the son's forbearance.

But again, the issue is whether that forbearance is valid consideration. If the son was giving up a legal right (to drink), then yes. But if he was merely promising to do something he's legally required to do (not doing drugs), then that part wouldn't count, but the drinking part would.

Wait, but in the scenario, the son is 21. So, he's of legal drinking age. So, he has the legal right to drink. By promising not to, he's giving up that right, which would be valid consideration.

So, perhaps there is a contract here. The father's promise to buy the car is supported by consideration from the son.

But then what happens when the father dies? The executor is saying he doesn't feel compelled to give the car. So, the son sues the estate.

In contract law, when one party dies, the other party can still enforce the contract against the estate. So, the executor would have to fulfill the contractual obligations unless there's a reason not to.

So, the options are whether the son can enforce the contract. The options given include things about consideration, whether the promise was void, whether the executor has final say, etc.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Not succeed because father's death nullifies the promise. That doesn't seem right because the estate typically takes on the deceased's contractual obligations.

Option B: Not succeed because father's promise was void. I don't think the promise was void. It was a valid offer.

Option C: Not succeed because executor has final say. No, the executor must follow the contracts of the deceased unless there's a legal reason.

Option D: Not succeed because son's promise wasn't a legal contract. That would be if there's no consideration, but I think there was.

Option E: Succeed because son's promise provided consideration. That seems correct if consideration is present.

Option F: Not succeed because father's promise was a conditional gift. Wait, if it's a gift, then it's not a contract. Gifts don't require consideration. So, if the father's promise was a conditional gift, then it's a matter of gift law, not contract. In that case, the son might not have a claim because gifts can be revoked unless there's a written note (like a deed) or delivery.

Wait, this is an important point. Was the father's promise a contract or a gift? If it's a unilateral contract, then it's enforceable. If it's a gift, then it's not.

So, the father said, "I will buy you a new car at the end of basic training if you promise not to take illegal drugs or drink alcohol while at basic training." The son replied, "You can order the new car right away. I promise..." So, the son accepted by promising, and the father relied on that by ordering the car.

In contract terms, that's an offer for a unilateral contract. The father is making an offer that the son can accept by performing (i.e., not drinking or using drugs). The son's promise to perform could be seen as the acceptance, but in unilateral contracts, acceptance is the performance, not a promise to perform. So, the son's promise might not be enough; the actual performance (abstaining during training) would be the acceptance.

Wait, but the son did perform. He went through training, didn't drink or use drugs, and when he returned, the father confirmed the car was ordered. Then the father dies before delivery. So, the performance was done, and the father had already ordered the car.

In that case, the contract was formed when the son performed. So, the contract is enforceable against the estate.

But wait, the issue is whether the son's promise was sufficient consideration. If the contract was unilateral, the consideration is the son's performance (abstinence), not his promise. So, the promise to perform isn't consideration; the actual performance is.

So, when the father made the offer, the son's acceptance was his performance, not his promise. But in this case, the son made a promise, and the father relied by ordering the car. Does that create a binding contract?

Alternatively, if the father made a promise in exchange for the son's promise, that could be a bilateral contract. But for a bilateral contract, both parties must exchange promises. So, the father promises to buy the car, and the son promises to abstain. That would require consideration on both sides.

But if the son's promise is not valid consideration because he wasn't giving up a legal right, then it's not a valid contract. Wait, but he was giving up his right to drink. If he's 21, he can drink legally, so that's a valid consideration.

Wait, but in the scenario, the son is enlisting on his 21st birthday. So, he's just turned 21. So, drinking is now legal for him. So, his promise to not drink would be a valid consideration because he's giving up a legal right.

But the problem is that sometimes, when someone is making a promise to do something they're already supposed to do, it's not consideration. For example, promising to refrain from illegal activities isn't consideration because you're not allowed to do it anyway. But in this case, the son is promising not to drink, which he can legally do. So, that's a valid consideration.

So, putting this together, the son's promise to not drink or do drugs includes giving up a legal right (to drink), so that's valid consideration. Therefore, the contract is enforceable.

But wait, the father dies before delivering the car. The executor says he doesn't have to give it. But contracts are enforceable against the estate. So, the son should be able to enforce the contract.

Looking at the options:

Option E says the son will succeed because his promise provided consideration. That seems correct.

Option F says he won't succeed because the father's promise was a conditional gift. But if it's a contract, it's not a gift. So, if the son can establish that there was a contract, then it's enforceable.

Another point: the father had already ordered the car. So, he had performed his part by ordering it. The only thing left was delivery, which would have happened in a month. But the father dies before that. So, the estate should deliver the car as per the contract.

Wait, but what if the contract was that the father would buy the car only if the son kept his promise. The son did keep it, so the father was under an obligation to buy the car. The father had already ordered it, so the contract was fulfilled in part, and the estate should complete it.

Alternatively, if the father had not ordered the car, perhaps the son couldn't enforce it, but since he did order it, the contract is already being performed.

So, the correct answer should be E: succeed because the son's promise provided consideration.

Wait, but let me check the other options again. Option F says it's a conditional gift. If the father's promise was a gift, then it's not a contract, and the son can't enforce it. But for a gift, there must be donative intent and delivery. Here, the father's promise was in exchange for the son's promise, so it's more of a contract than a gift.

So, I think the correct answer is E.

The question revolves around whether the son can enforce a contract with his father's estate to receive a new car, promised in exchange for the son's promise to abstain from illegal drugs and alcohol during basic training. To determine this, the analysis focuses on the elements of a valid contract: offer, acceptance, and consideration.

The father's promise to buy the car was conditioned on the son's promise to refrain from illegal drugs and alcohol. The son accepted this offer by promising to abstain and later confirmed that he had done so. For a contract to be enforceable, consideration is required, which involves the exchange of something of legal value. Here, the son's promise to abstain from alcohol is significant because, at 21, he had the legal right to drink. By promising not to drink, he surrendered a legal right, which constitutes valid consideration. However, his promise to avoid illegal drugs does not count as consideration because he was already legally obligated to abstain from illegal activities.

The father's death does not nullify the contract. Contracts are generally enforceable against the estate of the deceased. The executor's reluctance to deliver the car does not negate the contractual obligation. The father had already ordered the car, indicating that the contract was being performed. Therefore, the estate is obligated to fulfill the father's promise.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The father's death does not nullify the contract; it remains enforceable against the estate.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The father's promise was not void; it was a valid offer supported by consideration.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The executor does not have unchecked discretion to disregard the father's contractual obligations.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The son's promise to abstain from alcohol constituted valid consideration, making the contract legally enforceable.
- **Option E**: Correct. The son's promise to refrain from drinking alcohol provided sufficient consideration, making the contract enforceable.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The father's promise was not a conditional gift but a contractual offer supported by consideration.

The correct answer is **E**, as the son's promise provided sufficient consideration, and the contract is enforceable against the father's estate.

Answer: E
