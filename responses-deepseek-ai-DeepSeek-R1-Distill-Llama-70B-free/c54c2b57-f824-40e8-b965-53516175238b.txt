Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by reading it carefully.

The problem says that clay contains 30% Al₂O₃, 55% SiO₂, and 15% H₂O. I need to find out how much limestone (which is CaCO3) is required per ton of clay for a specific chemical reaction. The reaction given is:

6CaCO3 + Al₂O3 + SiO2 → 3CaO·Al₂O3 + 3CaO·SiO2 + 6CO2

Hmm, so the reaction is using CaCO3 to react with Al₂O3 and SiO2 from the clay. The products are calcium aluminate and calcium silicate, plus CO2 gas. I think the CaCO3 is acting as a source of CaO after decomposing, right?

Wait, wait. Let me break down the reaction. The CaCO3 decomposes into CaO and CO2. So each mole of CaCO3 gives one mole of CaO. But looking at the reaction, each product (3CaO·Al₂O3 and 3CaO·SiO2) has three CaO each. So total, 3+3=6 CaO molecules are needed. And since each CaCO3 gives one CaO, that's why we have 6 CaCO3 in the reactants. Makes sense.

So, for each mole of Al₂O3 and each mole of SiO2, we need 6 moles of CaCO3. Because the reaction uses one mole each of Al₂O3 and SiO2, and six of CaCO3.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. The reaction equation is 6CaCO3 + 1 Al₂O3 + 1 SiO2 → products. So for each mole of Al₂O3 and each mole of SiO2, 6 moles of CaCO3 are needed. Or wait, no, the Al₂O3 and SiO2 are separate. So if both are present, their moles would add up, I think. Or maybe it's per each pair of Al₂O3 and SiO2. Hmm, maybe I should consider the total amount of CaO needed from the CaCO3.

Wait, another approach: Let's calculate the moles of each component in the clay and determine how much CaCO3 is needed for each, then sum them up.

Wait, the reaction equation shows that for each mole of Al₂O3 and each mole of SiO2, we need 6 moles of CaCO3. Because the stoichiometric coefficients are 6 for CaCO3, 1 for Al₂O3, and 1 for SiO2. So for each mole of Al₂O3, 6 moles of CaCO3 are needed, and similarly for each mole of SiO2, 6 moles of CaCO3 are needed. Or wait, no. Because the reaction uses 1 mole of each, but 6 of CaCO3. So for each mole of Al₂O3 and each mole of SiO2, 6 moles of CaCO3 are consumed. So the total CaCO3 needed per mole of each would be 6.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider the reaction in terms of the amounts of Al₂O3 and SiO2 in the clay. So each of these requires CaCO3 in a certain ratio.

Let me outline the steps I need to take:

1. Calculate the amount of Al₂O3 and SiO2 in one ton of clay.
2. Determine the moles of each (Al₂O3 and SiO2) in the clay.
3. For each of these, calculate how many moles of CaCO3 are needed based on the reaction.
4. Sum these to get total moles of CaCO3 required.
5. Convert moles to mass, then to the appropriate unit (probably grams, but the options are in grams or 1e6 grams).

Wait, the clay is 30% Al₂O3 and 55% SiO2. So in one ton (1000 kg or 1,000,000 grams) of clay, the amounts are:

Al₂O3: 0.3 * 1e6 grams = 300,000 g
SiO2: 0.55 * 1e6 g = 550,000 g

Wait, yes. So then, moles of Al₂O3 = mass / molar mass.

Molar masses:

Al₂O3: Al is ~27 g/mol, so 2*27 =54, plus 3*16=48, total 102 g/mol.

So moles of Al₂O3 = 300,000 g / 102 g/mol ≈ 2941.176 moles.

Similarly, SiO2: Si is 28, O is 16*2=32, so 60 g/mol.

Moles of SiO2 = 550,000 / 60 ≈ 9166.6667 moles.

Now, looking back at the reaction equation: for each mole of Al₂O3, 6 moles of CaCO3 are needed. Same for each mole of SiO2. Because the reaction is 6 CaCO3 + 1 Al₂O3 + 1 SiO2 → ... So each mole of Al₂O3 requires 6 moles of CaCO3, and each mole of SiO2 requires 6 moles as well.

Wait, no, wait. The reaction equation shows that 6 moles of CaCO3 are used along with 1 mole Al₂O3 and 1 mole SiO2. So, for each pair of 1 mole Al₂O3 and 1 mole SiO2, 6 moles of CaCO3 are used. But in the clay, Al₂O3 and SiO2 are present in certain amounts. So perhaps we need to find how much each contributes to the CaCO3 requirement.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of how much CaCO3 is needed per mole of each oxide. Alternatively, perhaps the reaction should be considered as requiring 6 moles of CaCO3 for every mole of Al₂O3 and every mole of SiO2. Wait no, that might not be accurate. Let me think again.

The reaction equation is 6 CaCO3 + Al₂O3 + SiO2 → products.

So, per mole of Al₂O3 and per mole of SiO2, 6 moles of CaCO3 are needed. So for each mole of Al₂O3, 6 moles CaCO3. Similarly, for each mole of SiO2, 6 moles CaCO3. So the total CaCO3 needed would be 6*(moles of Al₂O3 + moles of SiO2).

Wait, that makes sense. Because each oxide requires 6 CaCO3 each, so total is the sum of each multiplied by 6.

So let's calculate that.

Moles of Al2O3: 300,000 / 102 ≈ 2941.176 moles

Moles of SiO2: 550,000 / 60 ≈ 9166.6667 moles

Total moles requiring CaCO3: 2941.176 + 9166.6667 ≈ 12107.843 moles

Wait no, because each of these individually requires 6 CaCO3 per mole.

So:

For Al₂O3: 2941.176 moles * 6 = 17646.06 moles CaCO3

For SiO2: 9166.6667 *6 = 55,000 moles

Wait, 9166.6667 * 6 = 55,000 exactly? Let me check:

9166.6667 *6 = let's see: 9000*6=54,000; 166.6667*6=1000 → total 55,000. Yes, that's correct.

So total CaCO3 moles needed = 17,646.06 + 55,000 = 72,646.06 moles.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 17,646 plus 55,000 is 72,646.06? Wait, 17k +55k is 72k, yes.

Wait no, wait a minute. Let me think again. Because the reaction equation uses 1 mole of Al₂O3 and 1 mole of SiO2 together with 6 moles of CaCO3. So perhaps for each mole of each, 6 moles of CaCO3 are needed. So the total would be 6*(moles of Al2O3 + moles of SiO2).

Wait, in the reaction, 6 moles of CaCO3 are consumed per mole of Al₂O3 and per mole of SiO2. So yes, the approach is correct.

So total moles of CaCO3 needed: 6*(2941.176 +9166.6667) = 6*(12107.843) ≈72746.06 ≈72,746 moles.

Wait no, wait. 2941.176 +9166.6667 = 12107.843. Multiply by 6: 72,746.06 moles of CaCO3.

Wait, but that seems high. Let me double-check the reaction equation. Oh wait, the product is 3CaO·Al2O3 and 3CaO·SiO2, which each have 3 CaO. So for each Al2O3, we need 3 CaO, and same for SiO2, 3 CaO. So total CaO needed per mole of Al2O3 is 3, per mole of SiO2 is 3. So total CaO per mole of each is 3 each. So for each mole of Al2O3, we need 3 moles CaCO3, and same for SiO2. Then total CaCO3 would be 3*(moles Al2O3 + moles SiO2)*.

Wait, no. Because the reaction is using 6 CaCO3 for 1 Al2O3 and 1 SiO2. So for each mole of Al2O3 and each mole of SiO2, 6 moles of CaCO3 are used.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is whether Al2O3 and SiO2 are each needing 6 moles of CaCO3 each, or together. Let me think about the stoichiometry.

The reaction equation is: 6 CaCO3 + 1 Al₂O3 + 1 SiO2 → products.

So for each mole of Al₂O3 and each mole of SiO2, 6 moles of CaCO3 are needed. So both together require 6 moles. So per mole of Al₂O3 plus per mole of SiO2, 6 moles CaCO3.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Because if I have, say, 1 mole Al₂O3 and 1 mole SiO2, I need 6 moles CaCO3. But if I have 2 moles Al₂O3 and 2 moles SiO2, would that need 12 moles CaCO3? Or 6 moles CaCO3?

Wait, no, that can't be. Because if I double the amounts, I should double the CaCO3 as well. So the correct approach is that for each mole of Al₂O3, 6 moles CaCO3 are needed, and for each mole of SiO2, another 6 moles are needed. So the total would be 6*(moles Al₂O3 + moles SiO2).

Wait, but the reaction equation suggests that 6 moles CaCO3 are used for 1 mole each of Al and Si. So per mole of Al or per mole of Si, 6 moles CaCO3. So for each, 6, so overall 12? No, that can't be right.

Wait no, no, the reaction equation is 6 CaCO3 reacting with 1 mole Al and 1 mole Si. So for each mole of Al and each mole of Si, 6 moles CaCO3 are needed. So I think each of them requires 3 moles CaCO3. Because the products for Al would be 3 CaO·Al₂O3, which requires 3 CaO per Al₂O3. Similarly for SiO2, 3 CaO per SiO2. So each CaCO3 gives one CaO. So for each Al₂O3, 3 CaCO3 needed, and same for each SiO2. That makes the total per mole of each 3 each, so 6 total.

Wait, now I'm getting confused. Let me try to re-examine the reaction.

The products are 3CaO·Al₂O3 and 3CaO·SiO2. Each of these has 3 CaO molecules. So each product requires 3 CaO per formula unit.

Looking at the reactants, the CaO comes from the decomposition of CaCO3. Each mole of CaCO3 gives one mole of CaO. So for each mole of 3CaO·Al₂O3, we need 3 moles of CaO, which comes from 3 moles of CaCO3. Similarly, each mole of 3CaO·SiO2 requires 3 moles of CaCO3.

So for each mole of Al₂O3, 3 moles CaCO3 are needed. For each mole of SiO2, another 3 moles CaCO3. So total per mole of each would be 3 +3 =6.

Wait, but the reaction equation shows 6 CaCO3 for 1 Al₂O3 and 1 SiO2. So yes, that aligns. So for each mole of Al₂O3 and each mole of SiO2, 3 each, so 6 total.

So, for each mole of Al₂O3, 3 CaCO3; for each mole of SiO2, 3 CaCO3. So the total moles of CaCO3 needed would be 3*(moles Al₂O3 + moles SiO2).

Wait, that makes more sense. So let me recalculate.

Moles of Al₂O3: 300,000 g / 102 g/mol ≈2941.176 moles.

Moles of SiO2: 550,000 /60 ≈9166.6667 moles.

Total moles needing CaCO3: 2941.176 +9166.6667≈12107.843 moles.

Each of these needs 3 moles CaCO3, so total CaCO3 moles: 3 * 12107.843 ≈36323.529 moles.

Wait, wait, that's conflicting with my earlier approach. So which is correct?

Wait, let's go back to the reaction equation:

6 CaCO3 + Al₂O3 + SiO2 → 3 CaO·Al₂O3 + 3 CaO·SiO2 + 6 CO2.

So for each mole of Al₂O3 and each mole of SiO2, 6 moles of CaCO3 are used.

So if I have 1 mole Al and 1 mole Si, I need 6 moles CaCO3.

So perhaps the correct way is for each mole of Al and each mole of Si, 6 moles CaCO3 are needed. So:

Total moles CaCO3 = 6 * (moles Al₂O3 + moles SiO2) ?

No, that can't be, because each requires 3 each. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, think in terms of the reaction as written. For each mole of Al₂O3 and each mole of SiO2, 6 moles of CaCO3 are needed. So the total CaCO3 per mole of each would be 6.

Wait no, the reaction uses 1 mole Al and 1 mole Si with 6 CaCO3. So for each mole of Al and each mole of Si, 6 moles CaCO3 are needed. So the total would be 6 per mole of Al and per mole of Si. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction produces 3 moles of CaO·Al₂O3 and 3 moles of CaO·SiO2, each requiring 3 moles of CaO. So the total CaO needed is 3 +3=6 per mole of Al and Si. Since each CaCO3 gives one CaO, that would require 6 moles CaCO3 per mole of Al and Si.

So perhaps for each mole of Al₂O3 and each mole of SiO2, 6 moles of CaCO3 are needed. So the total would be 6*(moles Al₂O3 + moles SiO2). Wait, but that would be 6*(2941.176 +9166.6667) =6*12107.843≈72,747 moles of CaCO3.

Wait, but that seems high. Let's compute the mass of that.

Molar mass of CaCO3: Ca is 40, C is 12, O3 is 48. So 40+12+48=100 g/mol.

So 72,747 moles * 100 g/mol = 7,274,700 grams, or 7.2747e6 grams.

Looking at the options, option A is 4.8e6, option C is 3.3e6, option E is 2.2e6, etc. None of the options match 7.2e6. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I misinterpreted the reaction. Let me think again. The reaction produces 3 CaO·Al₂O3 and 3 CaO·SiO2. Each of these requires 3 moles of CaO. So total CaO needed is 3 +3 =6 moles. Since each CaCO3 yields one CaO, that requires 6 moles of CaCO3. So for each mole of Al₂O3 and each mole of SiO2, 6 moles of CaCO3 are needed.

So the total moles of CaCO3 would be 6*(moles Al₂O3 + moles SiO2). Wait, no. Because each of Al and Si contributes to the CaO needed. Wait, perhaps for each mole of Al₂O3, 3 moles CaCO3; for each mole of SiO2, 3 moles CaCO3. So total CaCO3 would be 3*(moles Al + moles Si).

Yes, that's 3*(2941.176 +9166.6667) =3*(12107.843)≈36323.529 moles of CaCO3.

Then, converting to grams: 36323.529 moles * 100 g/mol = 3,632,352.9 grams, which is 3
