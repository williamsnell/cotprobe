Okay, so I have this bond problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me take it step by step. The question is about finding the effective yield of a bond. Alright, let's start by understanding the terms.

The bond has a face value of $1,000. The coupon rate is 6 and 3/4 percent. Wait, 6 3/4% is the same as 6.75%. Coupon rate is the annual interest payment, right? So that would be $68.75 per year because 6.75% of 1000 is 67.5, wait wait, no, wait. 1000 * 0.0675 is 67.5. Oh wait, 6 3/4 is 6.75, so yes, 1000 * 0.0675 = 67.5. So the bond pays $67.50 each year.

Now, the bond is purchased at 88 3/4. That's the price I paid for it. 88 3/4 dollars per bond. Wait, 88.75 dollars because 3/4 is 0.75. So the purchase price is 88.75% of the face value, or $887.50? Wait, no, wait. No, because when bonds are quoted, the price is as a percentage of face value. So if it's 88.75, that means $887.50 per $1000 face value. Oh wait, the face value is $1000, so 88.75 would be 0.8875 * 1000 = $887.50. So I paid $887.50 for this bond.

The question is asking for the effective yield. Effective yield is the rate of return that you get on a bond, considering both the coupon payments and the capital gain or loss when you sell it. Wait, but since this is a bond purchased and held to maturity, the effective yield would be the yield to maturity (YTM), right? So I think I need to calculate the YTM here.

YTM is the internal rate of return of the bond, considering the time value of money. The formula for YTM is a bit complex. Let me remember it. The YTM is the discount rate that makes the present value of all cash flows equal to the purchase price.

So the formula is:

Purchase Price = (C + (F - P)*(1/(1+r)^n)) / r

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The bond pays a coupon each year, and then at maturity, it pays the face value. So the cash flows are annual coupons of $67.50 each year for n years, plus the face value at the end.

Wait, but I think the standard formula for YTM is:

YTM = [ (C + (F - P)/n ) / ( (F + P)/2 ) ] * 100

Wait, no, that's the approximation formula. But maybe that's not precise enough. Alternatively, I can use the present value approach, which is more accurate.

The correct formula is that the sum of the present value of each coupon plus the present value of the face value equals the purchase price.

So, mathematically:

PV = C/(1+r) + C/(1+r)^2 + ... + C/(1+r)^n + F/(1+r)^n

Which can be simplified using the present value of an annuity formula:

PV = C * [1 - (1/(1+r)^n)] / r + F / (1+r)^n

In this case, PV is the purchase price, which is $887.50. The coupon payment C is $67.50 every year. The face value F is $1000. The number of years n is the time until maturity. Wait, the question doesn't say how many years until maturity. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, maybe the bond is sold at a discount, so it's not a newly issued bond. Wait, perhaps it's a 20-year bond or something, but the time until maturity is not given. Oh wait, perhaps the bond is sold at a certain time, and the time to maturity is given implicitly. Wait, wait, I think I'm missing something here. The question doesn't specify the time to maturity, so maybe I have to assume it's an annual payment and perhaps a certain number of years. Alternatively, perhaps the bond is a perpetual bond, but that can't be right because the coupon rate is fixed.

Wait, perhaps the bond is being held until maturity, but the time to maturity isn't given. Hmm, maybe the problem assumes a particular time frame. Alternatively, perhaps the bond is a 5-year bond, but it's not stated. Wait, maybe the problem assumes the bond is being purchased and held until maturity, but I'm not told the time to maturity. Oh wait, perhaps I've made a mistake, because the problem doesn't specify the time until maturity, so I can't calculate YTM without that.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe the question is miswritten, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding it. Alternatively, maybe the bond is being sold at 88.75, which is a price, and the coupon is 6.75%, so perhaps the yield to maturity can be calculated with the information given, assuming the bond is sold at a certain time before maturity. Oh wait, but without the time to maturity, I can't compute this. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe the bond is a 10-year bond, but I'm not told. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about a bond that's being sold at 88.75, which is 88 and 3/4 dollars per 100, so 88.75% of face value. So the price is $887.50, face value $1000, coupon 6.75%, and the question is about the effective yield, which is the YTM, but without knowing the years to maturity, I can't compute it.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the yield on the bond when it's purchased, but without knowing the time until it matures, I can't compute the YTM. So maybe the question is implying that the bond is purchased at 88.75, and we're to compute the yield to maturity, but perhaps I'm misinterpreting the problem.

Wait, maybe I'm supposed to compute the yield using the average of the coupon and the capital gain, but that would be an approximation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the bond is held until maturity, but the number of years is not given. Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the simple yield, which is (annual interest + capital gain) divided by purchase price. Let me think.

Simple yield is calculated as (C + (F - P)/n) / P. But without knowing n, the time to maturity, I can't compute that. So perhaps the question is using a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the question is treating this as a zero-coupon bond, but that can't be because the bond has a coupon rate of 6.75%. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is expecting the calculation to be based on the next coupon payment, but that seems unlikely.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again. The question is giving a bond with a 6.75% coupon, purchased at 88.75, and asking for the effective yield to the nearest 1/10 percent.

Wait, perhaps the effective yield here refers to the yield to maturity, and I can compute it using the approximation formula.

The formula for approximate YTM is:

YTM ≈ (C + (F - P)/n) / ((F + P)/2)

But without knowing n, I can't use this. Alternatively, perhaps the question is assuming that the bond is sold at a certain time, say, in one year, but that's not indicated.

Wait, perhaps the bond is a 5-year bond, and the price is 88.75. But I'm not told that. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the question is referring to the current yield, which is the coupon rate divided by the purchase price. So current yield = (67.50 / 887.50) * 100. Let me compute that.

67.50 / 887.50 = 0.076 or 7.6%. So that would be option A:7.6%. But the question is asking for effective yield, which is YTM, not current yield. So that might not be correct.

But since the question doesn't give the time to maturity, I'm stuck. Wait, perhaps the bond is a 10-year bond, but I'm not told. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the question is assuming that the bond is being held to maturity, and the price is 88.75, so using those to compute YTM without knowing the time. But that's impossible without knowing n.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think again. The bond's face value is $1000, coupon is 6.75%, so annual payment is $67.50. The purchase price is 88.75, which is $887.50. The question is about effective yield, which is yield to maturity. So to compute YTM, I need to know the number of years until maturity. But it's not given. So perhaps the question expects me to assume that the bond is a certain number of years, perhaps one year? But that can't be because the coupon is 6.75%, and if it's a one-year bond, the YTM would be (67.50 + (1000 - 887.50))/887.50 *100.

Wait, that would be (67.50 + 112.50)/887.50 = 180 /887.50 = approx 0.2028 or 20.28%, which isn't one of the options. So that can't be right.

Hmm. Maybe the bond is being sold at 88.75, and I'm supposed to compute the yield to maturity, but without knowing the time to maturity, perhaps I'm supposed to use the formula that only considers the coupon payment and the purchase price, ignoring the time value. But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually a mistake, and the time to maturity is given elsewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the bond is a 10-year bond, and the time to maturity is 10 years. Let me try that.

So, if n=10 years, then:

YTM is the r that satisfies:

887.50 = 67.50/(1+r) + 67.50/(1+r)^2 + ... + 67.50/(1+r)^10 + 1000/(1+r)^10.

This equation can be solved for r. Since it's a bit complex, perhaps I can use an approximation or trial and error.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the formula for the present value of an ordinary annuity and the present value of the face value.

So, the equation becomes:

887.50 = 67.50 * [1 - (1/(1+r)^10)] / r + 1000/(1+r)^10

This is a bit complicated to solve without a financial calculator, but maybe I can estimate r.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the approximate YTM formula, which is:

YTM ≈ (C + (F - P)/n) / ((F + P)/2)

Plugging in the numbers:

C = 67.50

F = 1000

P = 887.50

n = 10

So, YTM ≈ (67.50 + (1000 - 887.50)/10) / ((1000 + 887.50)/2)

Compute numerator: 67.50 + (112.50/10) = 67.50 + 11.25 = 78.75

Denominator: (1887.50 / 2 )= 943.75

So YTM ≈ 78.75 / 943.75 ≈ 0.0833, or 8.33%. Hmm, that's not matching any of the options exactly, but perhaps the exact calculation would give a different value.

Alternatively, perhaps the time to maturity is 5 years. Let me try that.

So, n=5.

Using the approximate formula again:

YTM ≈ (67.50 + (1000 - 887.50)/5) / ((1000 + 887.50)/2 )

Numerator: 67.50 + (112.50/5)= 67.50 +22.5=90.

Denominator: 943.75.

So YTM ≈90 /943.75 ≈ 0.0953, or 9.53%. Hmm, that's higher than the options given, which top out at 9.6%. But the options include 8.8%, 8.6%, etc.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe the question is expecting the calculation to be done without considering the time value of money, which would be incorrect, but perhaps that's what they're doing.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the yield on the bond when purchased at 88.75, which is 88 and 3/4. The formula for current yield is (annual coupon) / purchase price. So current yield is 67.50 /887.50 = 0.076 or 7.6%, which is option A. But the question is about effective yield, which is YTM, not current yield.

Hmm, I'm confused. Let me think again. Maybe the question is using the term 'effective yield' differently. In some contexts, effective yield refers to the yield when bonds are sold at a discount and held until maturity, but without knowing the time, I can't compute it.

Wait, perhaps the bond is a one-year bond. That would make sense if the price is 88.75, but then the yield would be (67.50 + (1000 -887.50)) /887.50 *100 = (67.50 +112.50)/887.50 *100= 180/887.50 ≈20.28%. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the bond is a two-year bond. Let me try that.

n=2.

Using the approximate YTM formula:

YTM ≈ (67.50 + (1000 -887.50)/2) / ((1000 +887.50)/2 )

Numerator: 67.50 + (112.50/2)=67.50 +56.25=123.75.

Denominator: 943.75.

YTM ≈123.75 /943.75 ≈0.1311 or 13.11%. Again, no match.

Wait, perhaps the effective yield is calculated as the coupon rate adjusted for the purchase price. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to compute the yield using the formula for a bond that's sold at a discount, and the formula is (C + (F - P)) / P. But that would be (67.50 + 112.50)/887.50=180/887.50≈20.28%, which again isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the yield on the bond if it's held until maturity, but without knowing the years, I can't compute it. Maybe the question assumes that the bond is a 10-year bond, and the YTM is calculated as per the options given.

Wait, looking at the options, the highest is 9.6%, and the others are lower. So perhaps with n=10, the approximate YTM I calculated earlier was about 8.33%, which isn't exactly an option, but the closest option is D:7.8%, which is 7.8%. Alternatively, perhaps a more precise calculation would give a different result.

Alternatively, perhaps I should set up the equation for YTM with n=10 and solve for r.

The equation is:

887.50 = 67.50/(1+r) + 67.50/(1+r)^2 + ... +67.50/(1+r)^10 + 1000/(1+r)^10

This is a bit tedious, but perhaps I can try plugging in some of the options to see which one fits.

Let's try option D:7.8% or 0.078.

Compute the present value:

PV = 67.50 * [1 - (1/(1.078)^10)] /0.078 + 1000/(1.078)^10

First, calculate (1.078)^10. Let me approximate:

1.078^10 ≈ e^(10 * ln(1.078)).

ln(1.078) ≈0.0756.

So 10 *0.0756=0.756. e^0.756≈2.13.

So (1.078)^10≈2.13.

So 1000/2.13≈469.61.

Now the annuity part: 67.50 * [1 - (1/2.13)] /0.078.

1/2.13≈0.4695.

So 1 -0.4695=0.5305.

So 67.50 * 0.5305 /0.078.

67.50 *0.5305≈35.83.

35.83 /0.078≈459.29.

So total PV≈459.29 + 469.61≈928.90.

But the purchase price is 887.50, which is lower than 928.90. So r=7.8% gives a PV higher than 887.50, meaning the actual YTM is higher than 7.8%.

Wait, because at higher r, the PV would be lower. So if at 7.8% the PV is 928.90, which is higher than 887.50, I need a higher r to bring PV down to 887.50.

Let me try r=8% or 0.08.

Compute (1.08)^10≈2.1589.

So 1000/2.1589≈463.19.

Annuity part:67.50 * [1 - (1/2.1589)] /0.08.

1/2.1589≈0.4632.

1 -0.4632=0.5368.

67.50 *0.5368 ≈36.33.

36.33 /0.08≈454.13.

Total PV≈454.13 +463.19≈917.32.

Still higher than 887.50. So r needs to be higher.

Try r=8.2% (0.082).

(1.082)^10≈ let's compute step by step:

1.082^1=1.082

1.082^2≈1.082 *1.082≈1.171.

1.082^4≈(1.171)^2≈1.371.

1.082^8≈(1.371)^2≈1.879.

1.082^10≈1.879 *1.082^2≈1.879 *1.171≈2.203.

So 1000/2.203≈454
