Okay, so I've got this problem here about photometry and lamps. Hmm, I remember that photometers measure the illuminance, which has to do with how much light is hitting a surface. The question says a standard 48-candle lamp is placed 36 inches from the screen, and it produces the same illuminance as an unknown lamp placed 45 inches away. I need to find the luminous intensity of the unknown lamp.

Wait, right, luminous intensity is measured in candelas, which I think is like the SI unit for it. So the problem is comparing two lamps based on their distances and intensities. I remember that illuminance depends on the intensity and the distance from the source. Oh right, the formula for illuminance is E = I / d², where E is illuminance, I is intensity, and d is distance.

So since both lamps produce the same illuminance at their respective distances, I can set their E values equal. So E1 = E2, which means I1 / d1² = I2 / d2². 

Let me plug in the numbers. I1 is the known intensity, 48 candles. d1 is 36 inches, and d2 is 45 inches. I'm trying to find I2, the unknown intensity. So substituting, 48/(36²) = I2/(45²).

Wait, let me compute the squares. 36 squared is 1296, and 45 squared is 2025. So the equation becomes 48/1296 = I2/2025. 

I can solve for I2 by cross-multiplying. So I2 = 48 * (2025/1296). Let's calculate that. 

Wait, simplifying the fraction 2025/1296. Hmm, 2025 divided by 1296. Let me see, both are perfect squares. 2025 is 45^2, 1296 is 36^2. So 45/36 simplifies to 5/4. So (45/36)^2 is (5/4)^2, which is 25/16. So 2025/1296 is 25/16. 

So I2 = 48 * (25/16). Let's compute that. 48 divided by 16 is 3, and 3 multiplied by 25 is 75. So I2 is 75 candles. 

Looking at the options, option G is 75 candles. So the answer should be G.

To determine the luminous intensity of the unknown lamp, we use the relationship between illuminance, luminous intensity, and distance: 

\[
E = \frac{I}{d^2}
\]

Since the illuminance produced by both lamps is the same, we equate their intensities and distances:

\[
\frac{I_1}{d_1^2} = \frac{I_2}{d_2^2}
\]

Substituting the known values:
- \(I_1 = 48 \, \text{candles}\),
- \(d_1 = 36 \, \text{inches}\),
- \(d_2 = 45 \, \text{inches}\),

we solve for \(I_2\):

\[
I_2 = I_1 \cdot \frac{d_2^2}{d_1^2}
\]

Calculating the squares:
- \(d_1^2 = 36^2 = 1296\),
- \(d_2^2 = 45^2 = 2025\),

we simplify the fraction:

\[
\frac{d_2^2}{d_1^2} = \frac{2025}{1296} = \frac{25}{16}
\]

Thus:

\[
I_2 = 48 \cdot \frac{25}{16} = 75 \, \text{candles}
\]

From the given options, the correct answer is **G: 75 candles**.
