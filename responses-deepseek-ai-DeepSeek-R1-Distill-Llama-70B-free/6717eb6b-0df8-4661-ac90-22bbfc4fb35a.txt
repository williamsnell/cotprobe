Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this probability problem about bridge hands. The question has two parts, (a) and (b), and I need to find the probabilities for each. Let me start by understanding what each part is asking.

Part (a) asks for the probability of having neither an ace nor a king in a 13-card bridge hand. So, I'm thinking about how many cards are aces or kings in a standard deck. There are 4 aces and 4 kings, making a total of 8 relevant cards. But since we want a hand with neither, I need to count the number of ways to choose 13 cards from the remaining ones that aren't aces or kings.

The deck has 52 cards. If I exclude the 8 aces and kings, that leaves me with 52 - 8 = 44 cards. So the number of favorable hands is the combination of 44 cards taken 13 at a time, which is C(44,13). The total number of possible hands is C(52,13). Therefore, the probability for part (a) is C(44,13)/C(52,13).

Let me compute that. I know that combinations can be calculated using factorials, but maybe I can find the approximate value. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the probability using hypergeometric distribution concepts. Either way, I'll need to calculate it.

Wait, another approach is to think about the probability step by step. The first card has a 44/52 chance of not being an ace or king. The second card, assuming the first wasn't, is 43/51, and so on. But that's a bit tedious for 13 cards, so using combinations is more efficient.

Now, moving on to part (b), which is a bit trickier. It asks for the probability of having no aces or exactly one ace and exactly four kings. So, we're looking for two scenarios combined: either (no aces and four kings) or (exactly one ace and exactly four kings).

But wait, can you have exactly one ace and four kings? Let me think: if you have one ace, you have four kings, and the rest are non-ace/non-king cards. So, the total number of cards accounted for would be 1 +4 =5, so the remaining 8 cards must be from the 44 others.

So for the case of no aces and four kings: The number of ways is C(4,4) * C(44,9). Because we're choosing all 4 kings and 9 other non-ace, non-king cards.

For the case of exactly one ace and four kings: The number of ways would be C(4,1) * C(4,4) * C(44,8). Because we're choosing 1 ace, all 4 kings, and 8 other cards.

Wait, no, that's not entirely correct. Because if you have one ace and four kings, you have 1+4=5 cards, so the remaining 8 must come from the 44 non-ace/non-king cards. So the correct calculation for this case is C(4,1) * C(4,4) * C(44,8).

So the total number of favorable hands for part (b) is [C(4,4)*C(44,9)] + [C(4,1)*C(4,4)*C(44,8)].

Then, the probability is this sum divided by C(52,13).

Now, I need to compute these values. Let me think about how to calculate each part.

Starting with part (a):

C(44,13) / C(52,13).

I can compute these using a calculator, but perhaps I can find approximate values or use known probabilities. Alternatively, maybe I can use the hypergeometric formula.

Wait, another approach: The probability of having no aces and no kings is equal to (number of ways to choose 13 cards from 44) divided by (number of ways to choose 13 from 52). So that's straightforward.

For part (b), the calculation is a bit more involved. Let me break it down.

First scenario: 0 aces, 4 kings.

Number of ways: C(4,0)*C(4,4)*C(44, 13-0-4) → Wait, no. Wait, if X is the number of aces and Y the number of kings, but in this case, X=0 and Y=4.

So, the number of aces chosen is 0, out of 4 available. The number of kings chosen is 4, out of 4 available. The remaining 13-0-4=9 cards must come from the 44 non-ace and non-king cards.

So the number of ways is C(4,0)*C(4,4)*C(44,9).

Second scenario: X=1 and Y=4.

So, C(4,1) ways to choose aces, C(4,4) for kings, and the remaining 13-1-4=8 from the 44 others. So C(4,1)*C(4,4)*C(44,8).

Adding these two gives the total number of favorable hands.

Now, I need to compute these combinations.

But wait, I'm not sure about the exact values, but perhaps I can find an approximate way to calculate these probabilities.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the probabilities using the hypergeometric distribution formula.

The hypergeometric probability is given by:

P(X = k) = [C(K, k) * C(N - K, n - k)] / C(N, n)

Where:
N = population size (52)
K = number of success states in the population (e.g., number of aces)
n = number of draws (13)
k = number of observed successes (aces or kings)

But in part (b), we're dealing with two variables X and Y, which are the number of aces and kings respectively. So it's a multivariate hypergeometric distribution.

The formula for multivariate hypergeometric is:

P(X=x, Y=y) = [C(4, x) * C(4, y) * C(44, 13 - x - y)] / C(52,13)

So in part (a), we're looking for x=0 and y=0. So P = [C(4,0)*C(4,0)*C(44,13)] / C(52,13), which matches what I thought earlier.

For part (b), it's the sum of two probabilities:

1. x=0, y=4: P1 = [C(4,0)*C(4,4)*C(44,9)] / C(52,13)
2. x=1, y=4: P2 = [C(4,1)*C(4,4)*C(44,8)] / C(52,13)

Then, the total probability for part (b) is P1 + P2.

So, let me calculate these values step by step.

First, let's compute part (a):

C(44,13) = 44! / (13! * (44-13)!) = 44! / (13! 31!) 

But calculating this directly would be time-consuming. Alternatively, I can use an approximate method or a calculator, but since I'm doing this manually, perhaps I can use known approximate values or relative probabilities.

Alternatively, maybe think in terms of the probability step by step.

But perhaps it's easier to compute the ratio C(44,13)/C(52,13).

I can compute this using logarithms or approximate using the normal approximation, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I can use online calculators or known combinatorial values.

Wait, alternatively, I remember that the probability of having no aces in a 13-card hand is approximately 0.31. But that's just for aces, not considering kings. So this will be lower.

Wait, actually, the probability of having no aces is C(48,13)/C(52,13). But in our case, part (a) excludes both aces and kings, so it's C(44,13)/C(52,13). So perhaps the value is around 0.08 or 0.081.

Looking at the options, the first part of each option is around 0.08, so that's probably correct.

Now, for part (b), the total is the sum of the two cases. Let's compute each term.

First case: x=0, y=4.

C(4,0) = 1, C(4,4)=1, C(44,9) = 44!/(9! 35!) 

Similarly, for the second case: x=1, y=4.

C(4,1)=4, C(4,4)=1, C(44,8) = 44!/(8! 36!)

So the numerator is [1 * 1 * C(44,9)] + [4 * 1 * C(44,8)].

I can factor out C(44,8) from both terms. Because C(44,9) = C(44,8) * (44-8)/9 = C(44,8) * (36/9) = C(44,8)*4.

So the numerator becomes:

(1 * 4 * C(44,8)) + (4 * 1 * C(44,8)) )

Wait, no, let me think again.

Actually, C(44,9) = C(44,8) * (44 - 8) / 9 = C(44,8) * 36/9 = 4 * C(44,8).

So substituting back, the first term is 1 * 1 * 4 * C(44,8) = 4 C(44,8), and the second term is 4 * 1 * C(44,8) =4 C(44,8). So total is 4 +4 =8 times C(44,8).

Wait, no, that can't be right. Wait, let me correct that.

Wait, the first term is 1 * 1 * C(44,9) = C(44,9) = 4 * C(44,8). The second term is 4 * 1 * C(44,8) =4 C(44,8). So the sum is (4 +4) C(44,8) =8 C(44,8).

Wait, no, because 4 C(44,8) plus 4 C(44,8) is 8 C(44,8). So the numerator becomes 8 * C(44,8).

Then, the probability is 8 * C(44,8) / C(52,13).

Alternatively, maybe I should compute each term separately.

But perhaps I can compute each term numerically.

Let me attempt to compute the values.

First, compute C(44,13):

But wait, perhaps it's easier to compute the probabilities using known software or calculator, but since I don't have access, I'll proceed with approximations.

I remember that C(52,13) is approximately 6.35e+11.

Similarly, C(44,13) is about 1.86e+11.

So the probability for part (a) is 1.86e+11 / 6.35e+11 ≈ 0.293. Wait, that's about 29.3%, which seems high because it's the probability of having no aces or kings. Wait, that can't be right because I thought the probability was around 0.08. Hmm, maybe my memory is off.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

We can compute the natural logarithm of the combinations to make it manageable.

The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! (n-k)! )

The natural log of C(n, k) is ln(n!) - ln(k!) - ln((n-k)! )

Using Stirling's approximation might help, but it's time-consuming.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula for hypergeometric probability.

Wait, perhaps I can compute the odds using the multiplicative approach for each card drawn.

For part (a), the probability of no aces and no kings is:

The first card has 44/52 chance, then 43/51, and so on until 44-12=32/52-12+1=32/41.

So the probability is the product from i=0 to 12 of (44 - i) / (52 - i).

This product can be approximated using logarithms.

But this is getting complicated. Alternatively, I can use the formula for the probability of no successes in a hypergeometric distribution.

Wait, the hypergeometric probability for 0 aces and 0 kings is [C(4,0) * C(4,0) * C(44,13)] / C(52,13).

So, looking for the value of C(44,13)/C(52,13).

I think this is approximately 0.0812. Looking at the options, option H is 0.0812 for the first part, and 0.0024 for the second. But I'm not sure yet.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use an online calculator or known values.

Wait, I think the probability of having no aces and no kings in a 13-card hand is about 0.0818 or 0.0812. Looking at the options, G is 0.0818, H is 0.0812.

But I'm not certain. Let's think about part (b) now.

Part (b) is the sum of two probabilities: 0 aces and 4 kings, and 1 ace and 4 kings.

We can compute each part separately.

First, for 0 aces and 4 kings.

The number of ways is C(4,0)*C(4,4)*C(44,9) = 1*1*C(44,9).

Second, for 1 ace and 4 kings: C(4,1)*C(4,4)*C(44,8) =4*1*C(44,8).

So the total number of favorable hands is C(44,9) +4*C(44,8).

We can factor out C(44,8): C(44,8) [ C(44 -8, 9-8) * (9!8!)/(9!8!) ) +4 ].

Wait, perhaps that's not helpful. Alternatively, note that C(44,9) = C(44,8) * (44-8)/9 = C(44,8) * 36/9 =4*C(44,8). So C(44,9) =4*C(44,8). Therefore, the total becomes 4*C(44,8) +4*C(44,8) =8*C(44,8).

So the number of favorable hands is 8*C(44,8).

Now, the total number of hands is C(52,13), so the probability is 8*C(44,8)/C(52,13).

Now, I need to compute this value.

Hmm, perhaps I can compute the ratio of C(44,8) to C(52,13), multiplied by 8.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the probability as follows.

First, compute C(44,8) / C(52,13), then multiply by 8.

Wait, but C(52,13) is a huge number. Let me think of this in terms of factorials.

C(44,8) = 44!/(8! 36!)

C(52,13) =52!/(13! 39!)

So the ratio is [44!/(8!36!)] / [52!/(13!39!)] = [44! *13!39! ] / [8!36! *52! ]

But 52! =52*51*50*49*48*47*46*45*44!

So substituting, the ratio becomes [13! *39! ] / [8!36! *52*51*50*49*48*47*46*45 ]

Simplify numerator and denominator.

Let me write it out:

Numerator: 13! *39! 
Denominator: 8! *36! *52*51*50*49*48*47*46*45

Now, let's see if we can cancel terms.

Note that 39! =36! *37*38*39.

So substituting that, the numerator becomes 13! *36! *37*38*39.

The denominator is 8! *36! * ... (the rest).

So 36! cancels out from numerator and denominator.

Now, the ratio becomes [13! *37*38*39] / [8! *52*51*50*49*48*47*46*45 ]

Now, 13! =13*12*11*10*9*8! → So 13! =13*12*11*10*9*8!.

So substituting that into the ratio:

[13*12*11*10*9*8! *37*38*39] / [8! *52*51*50*49*48*47*46*45 ]

The 8! cancels out.

So now we have:

13*12*11*10*9 *37*38*39 / [52*51*50*49*48*47*46*45 ]

Let me compute numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: 13*12=156; 156*11=1716; 1716*10=17160; 17160*9=154440.

Now, 154440 *37 = let's compute 154440 *30 =4,633,200; 154440 *7=1,081,080. So total is 4,633,200 +1,081,080=5,714,280.

Now, 5,714,280 *38: 5,714,280*30=171,428,400; 5,714,280*8=45,714,240. Sum is 171,428,400 +45,714,240=217,142,640.

Then, 217,142,640 *39: 217,142,640*30=6,514,279,200; 217,142,640*9=1,954,283,760. Sum is 6,514,279,200 +1,954,283,760=8,468,562,960.

So numerator is 8,468,562,960.

Now, the denominator: 52*51=2652; 2652*50=132,600; 132,600*49=6,497,400; 6,497,400*48=311,059,200;
