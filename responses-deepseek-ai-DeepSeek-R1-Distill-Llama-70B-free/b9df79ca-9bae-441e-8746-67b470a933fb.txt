Okay, so I've got this question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. The question is about why hot sand cools faster at night compared to vegetation. And the specific question is about the specific heat capacity of sand compared to vegetation.

Hmm, I remember specific heat capacity is the amount of heat required to change the temperature of a gram of a substance by one degree Celsius. So substances with higher specific heat can absorb and release more heat. Wait, but how does that relate to cooling?

So, if sand cools faster than vegetation at night, that suggests that sand loses heat more quickly. Now, specific heat capacity is about how much heat a substance can hold. If a substance has a higher specific heat, it can hold more heat without a big change in temperature. So when it starts to cool, it would release that heat more slowly, right? Because it has more heat stored.

Wait, but in this case, sand is cooling faster. So if sand has a lower specific heat capacity than vegetation, it would mean that sand doesn't hold as much heat. So when the sun goes down, it can't hold onto the heat as much, so it cools down faster. Because it can't retain the heat, it loses it quickly. 

So the specific heat capacity of sand must be lower than that of vegetation. Because higher specific heat would mean it holds onto heat longer, cooling more slowly. So sand, cooling faster, must have a lower specific heat capacity.

Looking at the options, option C is "lower". So the answer should be C.

Wait, but I should double-check. Are there other factors? Maybe other things like conductivity or emissivity? The question specifically mentions specific heat capacity, so those other factors might not be relevant here. Right, the question is directly comparing specific heat capacities.

So yeah, I'm pretty confident. The correct answer is C.

The question asks why hot sand cools faster at night than vegetation and specifically compares their specific heat capacities. Specific heat capacity is the amount of heat required to change the temperature of a substance. Substances with higher specific heat can absorb and release more heat, cooling more slowly. Since sand cools faster, it must have a lower specific heat capacity than vegetation, allowing it to lose heat more quickly. Other factors like conductivity or emissivity are irrelevant here, as the question focuses solely on specific heat capacity.

Answer: C
