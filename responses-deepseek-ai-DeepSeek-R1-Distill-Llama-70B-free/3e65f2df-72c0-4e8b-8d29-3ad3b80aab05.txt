Okay, so I've got this question about the BRIC countries and their approach to corporate governance. Hmm, let me think. I remember that BRIC stands for Brazil, Russia, India, and China. So the first blank should be China. Let me look at the options.

Looking at the options, option I says China as the fourth country. That makes sense. So the first part is probably China.

Now the second part is about their approach to corporate governance. I think BRIC countries traditionally have a more relationship-based approach. Because I recall that in many emerging markets, business relationships and networks are really important, sometimes more than formal rules. So the second blank should be 'Relationship'.

The third part says that recently they've moved towards more something-based mechanisms. I think this shift is towards market-based systems. Developed countries like the US have market-oriented governance, so as BRIC countries develop, they might adopt similar models. So the third blank is 'Market'.

Putting it all together, the sentence would read: The BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) tend to follow a Relationship approach, but are moving towards Market-based mechanisms.

Looking back at the options, option I is: China, Relationship, Market. Yep, that fits.

The BRIC countries are Brazil, Russia, India, and China. They traditionally follow a relationship-based approach to corporate governance but are shifting towards market-based mechanisms.
