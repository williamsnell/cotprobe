Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. The question is about a manufacturer who sells his merchandise at 135 percent of the cost, and we need to find his percentage gain. The options are from A to J, and I have to pick the right one.

Hmm, I remember that percentage gain, or profit, is calculated by comparing the profit made to the original cost. So if something costs $100 and sells for $135, the profit is $35. But wait, how does that translate into percentage?

Let me think. The formula for profit percentage is (Profit/Cost Price) * 100. So the profit here is Selling Price minus Cost Price. 

In this problem, the selling price is 135% of the cost. Let me denote the cost price as CP. So Selling Price (SP) would be 135% of CP, which is 1.35 * CP.

The profit would then be SP - CP, which is 1.35CP - CP. That equals 0.35CP. 

Now, to find the percentage gain, I take (Profit/CP)*100. So that's (0.35CP / CP)*100. The CP cancels out, leaving 0.35*100, which is 35%. 

Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So if the cost is $100, selling at 135% gives $135. Profit is $35, so 35/100 is 35%. Yeah, that makes sense.

Looking back at the options, option A is 35%, so that should be the correct answer. I don't think I made any miscalculations here. It's a straightforward percentage problem.

The manufacturer's selling price is 135% of the cost price (CP). To find the percentage gain:

1. **Selling Price (SP)** = 1.35 × CP  
2. **Profit** = SP - CP = 1.35CP - CP = 0.35CP  
3. **Percentage Gain** = (Profit / CP) × 100 = (0.35CP / CP) × 100 = 35%  

Thus, the correct answer is **35%**.
