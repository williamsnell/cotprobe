Okay, I've got this question here about inductors and calculating the voltage across them. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my electronics, but I'll try to think it through.

So the question has three parts, (a), (b), and (c), and each part gives different conditions. I remember that the voltage across an inductor is related to the rate of change of current. Oh right, the formula is V = L * (dI/dt), where L is the inductance and dI/dt is the rate of change of current.

Let's tackle each part one by one.

Starting with part (a): The inductor has an inductance of 30 mH, and the current is increasing at 20 mA/ms. Wait, units are tricky here. Let me convert everything to standard units to avoid confusion.

30 mH is 0.03 H. 20 mA is 0.02 A, and the rate is per millisecond. Oh, right, 1 ms is 0.001 seconds. So dI/dt is 0.02 A / 0.001 s = 20,000 A/s, which is 20 kA/s.

So applying V = L * dI/dt: 0.03 H * 20,000 A/s = 600 V? Wait, that seems really high. Wait, did I do the conversion right? Let me check. Oh wait, 20 mA is 0.02 A, and 1 ms is 1e-3 seconds. So 0.02 / 1e-3 = 20 A/s per mA per ms? Wait no, wait. Oh wait, 20 mA per ms is 0.02 A / 0.001 s. Oh yeah, that's 20 A/s. Wait wait, 0.02 divided by 0.001 is 20, right? So yeah, 20 A/s. So 0.03 H * 20 A/s = 0.6 V. Oh wait, that's 0.6 volts. So that would be the first value.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A starts with 0.6 V. So that's probably correct for part (a). Let me note that down.

Now part (b): The inductor is 0.4 mH at t=0, and the current is 50 e^(-10 t) mA. Oh wait, the current is given, so I need to find the voltage by taking the derivative of the current with respect to time.

First, convert units. 0.4 mH is 0.0004 H. The current is 50 mA, which is 0.05 A. But it's multiplied by e^(-10 t). So I=0.05 e^(-10t) A.

The derivative dI/dt is the rate of change. The derivative of e^(kt) is k e^(kt), so here k is -10. So dI/dt = 0.05 * (-10) e^(-10t) = -0.5 e^(-10t) A/s.

At t=0, e^0 is 1, so dI/dt = -0.5 A/s.

Wait, but the question is about the voltage. So V = L * (dI/dt). So 0.0004 H multiplied by (-0.5) A/s.

0.0004 * 0.5 is 0.0002, so 0.0002 volts, which is 0.2 mV? Wait, no, wait: 0.0004 * 0.5 is 0.0002 V, which is 0.2 mV. But wait, the options are in volts. Let me see. 0.0002 V is 0.2 mV, but none of the options have that. Wait, wait, perhaps I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, 0.0004 H is 4e-4 H. The derivative is -0.5 A/s. So 4e-4 * 0.5 = 2e-4 V, which is 0.2 mV, or 0.0002 V. But wait, looking at the options, option B for (b) is 0.3 V, which doesn't match. Hmm, maybe I messed up the exponent somewhere.

Wait, let me recheck. The current is 50 e^(-10t) mA. Oh wait, 50 mA is 0.05 A, yes. So dI/dt is 50 mA * (-10) * e^(-10t) derivative. Wait, but wait, let's compute dI/dt correctly.

I(t) = 50 e^(-10 t) mA = 0.05 e^(-10t) A.

dI/dt = 0.05 * (-10) e^(-10t) = -0.5 e^(-10t) A/s.

At t=0, this becomes -0.5 A/s.

So V = L * dI/dt. L is 0.4 mH = 0.0004 H.

V = 0.0004 * (-0.5) = -0.0002 V. But since voltage is a magnitude here, perhaps we take absolute value. So 0.0002 V is 0.2 mV.

Wait, but the options for part (b) in the choices are 0.2 V (option A), 0.3 V (option B), etc. Hmm, that's a big discrepancy. Did I miss a decimal somewhere?

Wait, perhaps the current is 50e^(-10t) mA. Oh wait, maybe the exponent is (-10t), but perhaps I miscalculated the derivative.

Alternatively, maybe I should have considered the negative sign, but the question is about the magnitude of the voltage. So 0.0002 V is 0.2 mV, but the options are in volts, so 0.2 mV is 0.0002 V, which isn't matching any option.

Wait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of dI/dt. Let me try again.

I(t) = 50 * e^(-10 t) mA = 50e-3 * e^(-10 t) A.

dI/dt = 50e-3 * (-10) e^(-10 t) = -500e-3 e^(-10 t) = -0.5 e^(-10 t) A/s.

At t=0, dI/dt = -0.5 A/s.

So V = 0.4e-3 H * (-0.5) A/s = -0.4e-3 * 0.5 = -0.2e-3 V, which is -0.0002 V. Absolute value is 0.0002 V, which is 0.2 mV.

Wait, but looking at the options, part (b) in option A is 0.2 V, which is 200 mV. That's a thousand times larger. Where did I go wrong?

Ah! Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents. Let me re-express the current.

The current is 50 e^(-10t) mA. Let me think about the derivative again. Maybe I should have included the time unit correctly.

Wait, 50e^(-10 t) mA is 0.05 e^{-10 t} A.

dI/dt = 0.05 * (-10) e^{-10 t} = -0.5 e^{-10 t} A/s.

At t=0, that's -0.5 A/s.

So V = L * dI/dt = 0.0004 H * (-0.5 A/s) = -0.0002 V. So 0.0002 V is 0.2 mV, which is 0.0002 V.

But the options don't have 0.0002 V. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, maybe the inductance is 0.4 mH, which is 0.4e-3 H, not 0.0004. Wait, 0.4 mH is 0.0004 H, right? Because 1 mH is 1e-3 H. So 0.4e-3 is correct.

Hmm, maybe I misread the question. Let me check the question again. Oh, part (b) says 0.4 mH at t=0, current is 50e^-(10)4 tmA. Wait, the current is 50 e^(-10^4 t) mA? Wait, no, the way it's written is a bit confusing.

Wait, the user wrote: (b) of 0.4mHat t = 0, if the current in it is 50e^-(10)4 tmA.

Wait, perhaps the exponent is -10*4 t, which is -40 t? Or perhaps 50 e^(-10^4 t) mA, which is 50 e^(-10000 t) mA. Oh, that would make a big difference.

Wait, perhaps the current is I(t) = 50 e^{-10^4 t} mA. That would be 50 e^{-10000 t} mA. Oh, that's a very rapidly decaying current.

In that case, the derivative would be much larger. Let's recalculate.

I(t) = 50 e^{-10000 t} mA = 0.05 e^{-10000 t} A.

dI/dt = 0.05 * (-10000) e^{-10000 t}.

At t=0, that's -0.05 * 10000 = -500 A/s.

So V = L * dI/dt = 0.0004 H * (-500) A/s = -0.2 V.

So the magnitude is 0.2 V. That matches option A's part (b) which is 0.2 V. Wait, option A is (0.6, 0.2, 0.08). So part (a) is 0.6, (b) is 0.2, which would fit.

Wait, but why did I initially think the exponent was -10t? Because the way it's written is a bit unclear. Oh, perhaps the current is 50e^(-10)4 t mA, which is 50 * e^(-10*4 t) = 50 e^(-40 t) mA. Hmm, that's another possibility. Let me see.

If it's 50 e^{-40 t} mA, then I(t) = 0.05 e^{-40 t} A.

dI/dt = 0.05 * (-40) e^{-40 t}.

At t=0, that's -2 A/s.

V = 0.0004 H * (-2 A/s) = -0.0008 V, which is 0.8 mV. Hmm, that's 0.0008 V, which is 0.8 mV. That doesn't match any option.

But if the exponent is -10000 t, then the voltage is 0.2 V as calculated earlier, which fits into option A's (b) part.

So perhaps the correct way to interpret the current is I(t) = 50 e^{-10000 t} mA. That would make the voltage 0.2 V.

Moving on to part (c): At t=0, the power entering the inductor is 12 cos(100 pi t) mW, and the current is 150 mA at t=0.

Hmm, power in an inductor is given by P = I * V. But since V = L dI/dt, then P = I * L (dI/dt).

Alternatively, power can also be expressed as P = I^2 R, but inductors have resistance only if they're not ideal. Wait, but this is about an inductor, which is typically considered ideal (no resistance). So maybe I should think in terms of energy and voltage.

Wait, but if power is given, perhaps I can find dI/dt from the power and current.

Given P = 12 cos(100 pi t) mW, which is 0.012 W, since 1 mW is 0.001 W. Wait no, 12 mW is 0.012 W.

So P(t) = 0.012 cos(100 Ï€ t) W.

The current at t=0 is 150 mA, which is 0.15 A.

At t=0, cos(0) is 1, so P(0) = 0.012 W.

So P = I * V => V = P / I.

At t=0, I = 0.15 A, so V = 0.012 W / 0.15 A = 0.08 V.

Wait, but wait: V is also equal to L (dI/dt). So if I can find L, I can check, but I don't have L given here. Wait, the question for part (c) doesn't give inductance. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, looking back, the question's part (c) says: at t=0, if the power entering it is given by 12 cos(100 pi t) mW and the current is 150 mA at t=0.

So we can find V at t=0 using P=IV.

So V(t) = P(t)/I(t). At t=0, P is 12 mW = 0.012 W, I is 0.15 A.

So V = 0.012 / 0.15 = 0.08 V.

So the voltage is 0.08 V.

So putting it all together:

(a) 0.6 V

(b) 0.2 V

(c) 0.08 V

Looking at the options, option A is (0.6, 0.2, 0.08). So that's the correct answer.

I think I got it right. So the answer is option A.

To solve the problem, we calculate the voltage across the inductor for each part using the relationship \( V = L \frac{dI}{dt} \), where \( L \) is the inductance and \( \frac{dI}{dt} \) is the rate of change of current. Here's the analysis for each part:

---

### Part (a)
The inductor has \( L = 30 \, \text{mH} = 0.03 \, \text{H} \), and the current is increasing at a rate of \( \frac{dI}{dt} = 20 \, \text{mA/ms} = 20,000 \, \text{A/s} \). Using the formula:

\[
V = L \frac{dI}{dt} = 0.03 \, \text{H} \times 20,000 \, \text{A/s} = 0.6 \, \text{V}.
\]

Thus, the voltage across the inductor is \( 0.6 \, \text{V} \).

---

### Part (b)
The inductor has \( L = 0.4 \, \text{mH} = 0.0004 \, \text{H} \), and the current is given as \( I(t) = 50 e^{-10^4 t} \, \text{mA} = 0.05 e^{-10,000 t} \, \text{A} \). The rate of change of current is:

\[
\frac{dI}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} \left( 0.05 e^{-10,000 t} \right) = 0.05 \times (-10,000) e^{-10,000 t}.
\]

At \( t = 0 \), \( e^{-10,000 t} = 1 \), so:

\[
\frac{dI}{dt} = -0.05 \times 10,000 = -500 \, \text{A/s}.
\]

The voltage across the inductor is:

\[
V = L \frac{dI}{dt} = 0.0004 \, \text{H} \times (-500 \, \text{A/s}) = -0.2 \, \text{V}.
\]

Taking the magnitude, the voltage is \( 0.2 \, \text{V} \).

---

### Part (c)
The power entering the inductor is given as \( P(t) = 12 \cos(100 \pi t) \, \text{mW} = 0.012 \cos(100 \pi t) \, \text{W} \), and the current at \( t = 0 \) is \( I(0) = 150 \, \text{mA} = 0.15 \, \text{A} \). At \( t = 0 \), \( \cos(100 \pi t) = 1 \), so:

\[
P(0) = 0.012 \, \text{W}.
\]

Using \( P = I V \), the voltage at \( t = 0 \) is:

\[
V = \frac{P}{I} = \frac{0.012 \, \text{W}}{0.15 \, \text{A}} = 0.08 \, \text{V}.
\]

---

### Final Answer
Combining the results from all three parts:
- (a) \( 0.6 \, \text{V} \)
- (b) \( 0.2 \, \text{V} \)
- (c) \( 0.08 \, \text{V} \)

The correct option is **A: 0.6 V, 0.2 V, 0.08 V**.
