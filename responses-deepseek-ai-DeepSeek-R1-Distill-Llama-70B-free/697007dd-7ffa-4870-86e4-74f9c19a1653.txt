Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about interferometry. Hmm, I remember that interferometry is a technique used to measure small surface irregularities. The question says that a workpiece is being examined using thallium light with a wavelength of 535 nm. 

The problem states that the fringes are distorted by 0.4 of the distance between the undistorted fringes. I'm trying to recall what that means. Oh right, in interferometry, the fringes represent interference patterns, and the distance between them is related to the wavelength of the light used. 

Wait, the distance between fringes is typically half the wavelength because that's the distance that corresponds to a phase shift of 2π, leading to constructive or destructive interference. So each fringe spacing is λ/2. So if the wavelength λ is 535 nm, then the fringe spacing is 535/2 nm. Let me calculate that: 535 divided by 2 is 267.5 nm. Oh wait, 267.5 times 10^-9 meters. 

But wait, the question says the distortion is 0.4 times the distance between the fringes. So the depth of the defect would be 0.4 multiplied by the fringe spacing. So 0.4 times 267.5 nm. Let me compute that: 0.4 * 267.5 = 107 nm. Because 267.5 * 0.4 is 107. So that's 107 nm, which is 107 × 10^-9 meters. 

But wait, looking at the options, let me see. Let's check the options given. Option B is 0.2 × 535 ×10^-9 m, which is 107e-9 m as well. Wait, because 535/2 is 267.5, so 0.4 * 267.5 is 107. So 107e-9 m is 1.07e-7 m? Wait no, 107 nm is 107 ×1e-9 m, which is 1.07e-7 m. Am I getting this right? Or wait, 1 nm is 1e-9 meters, so 107 nm is 107e-9, which is 1.07e-7 m. 

Looking at the options, option B says 0.2 ×535e-9. 0.2 *535 is 107, so that's 107e-9 m, which is 1.07e-7 m. Option D is 0.4×535e-7 m, which would be 214e-7 m, which is 214 nm, but that's larger than what I calculated. 

Wait, no, the question says that the distortion is 0.4 times the distance between the fringes. The distance between fringes is λ/2, so 535/2 nm. So 0.4 * (535/2) nm is the depth. Let me compute again. 535/2 is 267.5 nm. 0.4 * 267.5 = 107 nm. So 107 nm is 1.07e-7 meters. 

Looking at the options, option B is 0.2 ×535e-9 m, which equals 107e-9, which is 1.07e-7 m. So that's correct. But wait, option I is 0.4 ×2.675e-7 m. 2.675e-7 m is 267.5e-9 m, which is 267.5 nm. So 0.4 times that is 107e-9 m, same as 1.07e-7 m. Oh wait, so option I is 0.4 × 2.675e-7 m, which equals 1.07e-7 m as well. So both options B and I give the same value, but wait, let me check the units.

Option I is 0.4 ×2.675e-7 m. 2.675e-7 m is 267.5 nm. So 0.4 ×267.5 =107 nm, which is 1.07e-7 m. So option I is 0.4 ×2.675e-7 m =1.07e-7 m. Option B is 0.2 ×535e-9 m, which is 0.2 ×535 =107, so 107e-9 m, which is 1.07e-7 m. So both B and I give the same numeric value. But wait, looking at the options again, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, the question says the distortion is 0.4 of the distance between the fringes. The distance between fringes is λ/2. So the depth is 0.4*(λ/2) = 0.4*(535e-9 m /2 )=0.4*(267.5e-9)=107e-9 m.

So 107e-9 m equals 1.07e-7 m. Now, looking at the options:

Option B: 0.2 ×535e-9 = 107e-9 m.

Option I: 0.4 × 2.675e-7 m. 2.675e-7 m is 267.5e-9 m. 0.4 ×267.5e-9 is 107e-9 m. So both B and I give the same value. But that's impossible because each option is unique.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake because I thought the distance between fringes is lambda/2, but perhaps that's not correct. Let me think again. In some interferometry techniques, like in a Michelson interferometer, the path difference is measured, and the fringes are separated by lambda/2. Because when the path difference changes by lambda/2, you get a shift of one fringe. So the distance between fringes corresponds to lambda/(2). 

Wait, but in some setups, like in thin film interference, the path difference is 2t, so the condition might change, but in this case, it's about surface height differences. So the depth corresponds to a phase shift, which for a height h would correspond to a path difference of 2h (because the light reflects off the surface, so the path is 2h longer or shorter). Or wait, maybe it's just h. Hmm, I need to clarify this.

Wait, in interferometry, when you have a height difference h on the surface, the optical path difference is 2h, because the light goes down and back up, so the total difference is twice the height. But wait, in this problem, the question is simply relating the fringe distortion to the distance between fringes. So the depth h is 0.4 times the fringe spacing. 

Fringe spacing is lambda/2, so h = 0.4 * (lambda/2) = 0.4*(535e-9 m /2 ) = 0.4 * 267.5e-9 = 107e-9 m, which is 1.07e-7 m. 

Now, looking at the options:

Option B: 0.2 ×535e-9 = (0.2 ×535) e-9 =107e-9 =1.07e-7 m.

Option I: 0.4 ×2.675e-7 m. 2.675e-7 is 267.5e-9. 0.4 ×267.5e-9 =107e-9 =1.07e-7 m.

So both B and I give the same value. How can that be? That's confusing. Or maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps the fringe spacing is lambda, not lambda over 2. Maybe I was wrong about the fringe spacing. Let me think again. In a Michelson interferometer setup, when you have a tilt, the fringes are separated by lambda/(2 theta), but when the surface is flat, the fringes are not visible. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing things up.

Wait, another approach. The formula for the height h is h = (n * lambda) / 2, where n is the fringe order. But in this case, the distortion is 0.4 times the fringe spacing. So perhaps the depth is 0.4 times (lambda/2). So that's 0.4*(535e-9/2) =0.4 *267.5e-9 =107e-9 m.

So the correct answer should be 1.07e-7 m. Looking for 1.07e-7 m in the options.

Option F is 2.14e-4 mm, which is 2.14e-4 *1e-3 m = 2.14e-7 m. Not matching.

Option I: 0.4 * 2.675e-7 m. 2.675e-7 m is 267.5e-9 m. 0.4 *267.5e-9 =107e-9 m.

Option B: 0.2 *535e-9 =107e-9 m.

So both B and I give 107e-9 m, which is 1.07e-7 m. But how can two options be correct? That's impossible. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should express 107e-9 m in other units. 107e-9 m is 0.107 micrometers or 1.07e-7 m. Let's see the options again.

Option C: 2.14e-4 mm = 0.000214 mm. 1e-4 mm is 1e-7 m, so 2.14e-4 mm is 2.14e-7 m. No.

Option F: 1.07e-4 mm = 1.07e-7 m. Which is exactly what I have. So option F is 1.07e-4 mm, which is 1.07e-7 m.

Wait, so which is correct? Did I make a mistake in the calculation? Hmm.

Wait, let's start over. The fringe spacing is the distance between two consecutive bright or dark fringes. In many interferometers, the fringe spacing is given by delta = lambda / (2 theta), where theta is the angle between the two interfering beams. But when theta is small, delta is approximately lambda. However, for a flat surface and when observing the interference pattern, perhaps each fringe corresponds to a height change of lambda/2.

Wait, another approach. The OPD (optical path difference) for each fringe is lambda/2. So each fringe corresponds to a height change of lambda/(2*cos(theta)), assuming the surface is inclined at an angle theta. But if the surface is perpendicular, then theta is zero, so cos(theta) is 1, and the height change is lambda/2 per fringe.

Wait, in this problem, the fringes are distorted by 0.4 of the fringe spacing. So the depth would be 0.4*(fringe spacing). But what is the fringe spacing in terms of height?

Alternatively, perhaps each fringe corresponds to a height difference of lambda/2. So if the fringes are distorted by 0.4 fringes, that would mean a height change of 0.4*(lambda/2).

So 0.4 * (535e-9 m / 2) = 0.4 * 267.5e-9 =107e-9 m, which is 1.07e-7 m.

Looking for this value, does any option match?

Option F says 1.07e-4 mm. Wait, 1e-4 mm is 1e-7 m, so 1.07e-4 mm is 1.07e-7 m. So that's correct.

Option I says 0.4 ×2.675e-7 m: 2.675e-7 is 267.5e-9, so 0.4 ×267.5e-9 is 107e-9, which is 1.07e-7 m. So that's the same as option F.

Wait, this can't be correct. How can two options have the same value but different expressions? Let me check the options again.

Looking back:

Option F: 1.07 ×10^-4 mm → 1.07e-4 mm = 1.07e-7 m.

Option I: 0.4 ×2.675 ×10^-7 m → 0.4 *2.675e-7 = 1.07e-7 m.

Yes, both are 1.07e-7 m. So two options have the same value. That's impossible. So perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the fringe spacing.

Wait, maybe the fringe spacing is lambda, not lambda/2. So distance between fringes is lambda. So if the distortion is 0.4 × lambda, then the depth is 0.4 ×535e-9 m = 214e-9 m = 2.14e-7 m.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.14e-4 mm, which is 2.14e-7 m. So that would be correct.

But wait, earlier reasoning suggested that the fringe spacing is lambda/2. Now I'm confused. Let me think again.

In a Twyman-Green interferometer, which is used for testing polished surfaces, the fringes represent contours of equal height. Each fringe corresponds to a height difference of lambda/2. So yes, the fringe spacing is lambda/2.

So if the fringes are distorted by 0.4 of that spacing, the depth is 0.4*(lambda/2) = 0.2 lambda. Which is 0.2 *535e-9 m =107e-9 m=1.07e-7 m.

So looking at the options, which one is 1.07e-7 m.

Option F is 1.07e-4 mm =1.07e-7 m.

Option I is 0.4 * 2.675e-7 m. 2.675e-7 is 267.5e-9 m, which is lambda/2. So 0.4 * (lambda/2) is the depth. So that's 0.4*267.5e-9 =107e-9, which is 1.07e-7 m.

So both options F and I give the same value, which is 1.07e-7 m.

But the options can't have two correct answers, so perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the options again.

Option F: 1.07 ×10^-4 mm → 1.07e-7 m.

Option I: 0.4 ×2.675 ×10^-7 m → 1.07e-7 m.

So both are correct. But that's impossible. So perhaps the correct option is either F or I, but how to decide.

Wait, perhaps the units are different. Let me check the options.

Option F is in mm, so 1.07e-4 mm is 0.000107 mm, which is 1.07e-7 m.

Option I is in meters: 0.4 ×2.675e-7 m =1.07e-7 m.

So both options give the same value. But only one option can be correct. Perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, perhaps the depth is not 0.4*(lambda/2) but 0.4*lambda. Because sometimes, the number of fringes shifted corresponds to the depth. So for each fringe, the depth is lambda/2. So if the fringes are shifted by 0.4 of a fringe, the depth is 0.4*(lambda/2). Which is 0.2*lambda.

Wait, 0.2*lambda is 0.2*535e-9=107e-9 m=1.07e-7 m. Which is what I have.

So the correct answer should be 1.07e-7 m, which is option F or I. But both can't be correct. So perhaps I should re-examine the options.

Looking at the options again:

Option B: 0.2 ×535 ×10^-9 m → 0.2 *535 is 107, so 107e-9 m →1.07e-7 m.

Option I: 0.4 ×2.675 ×10^-7 m → 0.4 *2.675e-7 =1.07e-7 m.

So again, B and I both give the same value. This is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to note that each fringe corresponds to a height change of lambda/2. So the distance between fringes is lambda/2. So a distortion of 0.4 times that distance is 0.4*(lambda/2) = 0.4*(535e-9/2) =0.4*(267.5e-9) =107e-9 m.

Looking for 107e-9 in the options.

Option B: 107e-9 m.

Option I: 107e-9 m.

So both B and I give 107e-9 m.

But that can't be. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup. Maybe the fringes are separated by lambda, not lambda/2. Let's try that.

If the fringe spacing is lambda, then the depth is 0.4*lambda=0.4*535e-9=214e-9 m=2.14e-7 m.

Looking at the options, option C is 2.14e-4 mm=2.14e-7 m. So that would be correct.

But earlier reasoning suggested that the fringe spacing is lambda/2. So I'm torn between options F/I and C.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the fringes are a result of path difference, which for a surface height h, the path difference is 2h (because the light reflects off the surface, so a height h leads to a path difference of 2h). So in that case, the depth h would be (n * lambda)/2, where n is the number of fringes.

Wait, but in the problem, the distortion is 0.4 of the fringe spacing. So if the fringe spacing in terms of path difference is lambda, meaning that each fringe represents a path difference of lambda, then 0.4 fringes would correspond to a path difference of 0.4*lambda. But since the path difference is 2h, h would be (0.4*lambda)/2 =0.2*lambda.

So h=0.2*535e-9=107e-9 m.

So again, that brings me back to 107e-9 m. So the options B and I are correct.

But this is conflicting, so perhaps the correct answer is option B or I
