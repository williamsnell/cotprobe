Question:

A screenwriter had just finished a screenplay for a romantic comedy. After reading the screenplay, a movie studio decided to option the screenplay for production. A lawyer for the movie studio negotiated an agreement with the screenwriter whereby the movie studio would pay the screenwriter $5,000 for the rights to the screenplay, and 10 percent of the gross receipts earned by the distribution of the movie, should the studio decide to film the screenplay. Both sides signed the agreement. Two weeks later, the screenwriter was at a birthday party for a close friend when she discovered she had forgotten to purchase a gift for her friend. She quickly grabbed a piece of paper and wrote on it:"I promise that my friend is entitled to 5 percent of the proceeds I will receive for the distribution of the movie to be made from my screenplay. "The screenwriter then signed the paper, placed it in an envelope, and handed it to the friend. The promise to pay 5 percent of the proceeds to the friend may best be interpreted as a (an)

Options:

A: conditional assignment.
B: non-binding agreement.
C: legal gift.
D: contractual obligation.
E: gratuitous assignment of future rights.
F: binding promise.
G: revocable gift.
H: equitable lien.
I: informal contract.
J: irrevocable assignment.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about the screenwriter and her promise to her friend. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the screenwriter had a screenplay that a movie studio optioned. They agreed to pay her $5,000 plus 10% of the gross receipts if they make the movie. That's a contract between her and the studio, right? So she has a right to that 10% once the movie is distributed.

Then, at a birthday party, she forgot a gift. So she quickly wrote a note promising her friend 5% of the proceeds from the movie. She signed it and gave it to her friend. The question is about what kind of legal document or agreement this note represents.

Looking at the options, I need to figure out which one fits best. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Conditional assignment. An assignment transfers rights, and conditional might mean it's dependent on something happeningâ€”like the movie being made. But does this note assign rights, or is it a promise to pay from her share?

Option B: Non-binding agreement. Well, contracts require consideration, right? If this was a contract, there's no consideration unless the friend did something in return. But the scenario doesn't mention any. So maybe it's not binding? Or perhaps it's a gift.

Option C: Legal gift. A gift requires intent to give without compensation. She gave the note as a substitute for a birthday gift, which suggests she intended it as a gift. But is a percentage of future proceeds considered a legal gift? I'm not sure.

Option D: Contractual obligation. For a contract, there must be offer, acceptance, and consideration. She offered, the friend accepted by taking the note, but what's the consideration? The friend didn't provide anything. So maybe it's not a contract but something else.

Option E: Gratuitous assignment of future rights. Gratuitous means without payment. An assignment transfers rights. So she's assigning 5% of her future proceeds to her friend. But assignments can be revocable unless made irrevocable. I'm not sure if this counts as a valid assignment.

Option F: Binding promise. A promise can be binding if it's supported by consideration. Without consideration, it might not be enforceable. So if this is just a promise without something in return, it might not be binding.

Option G: Revocable gift. If it's a gift, the giver can usually revoke it unless it's an irrevocable transfer. But once given, can she take it back? Maybe, but I'm not certain.

Option H: Equitable lien. That's more about a right to keep property until a debt is paid. Doesn't seem to fit here.

Option I: Informal contract. Even if it's informal, a contract still needs the necessary elements. If there's no consideration, it's not a contract. So maybe not.

Option J: Irrevocable assignment. This would mean she can't take back the 5% once assigned. Assignments of future rights can be irrevocable if they meet certain criteria, but I'm not sure if a handwritten note signed and delivered qualifies as that.

Wait, the key here is that she's promising a percentage of her proceeds. This sounds like she's assigning a portion of her rights to the friend. Since she's transferring a part of what she's entitled to, it's an assignment. But is it conditional? It depends on the movie being made, I guess.

In contract law, assignments can be gratuitous. So option E says "gratuitous assignment of future rights." That might fit because she's giving the friend the right to 5% without receiving anything in return. But another thought: in some jurisdictions, an assignment of future rights must be in writing and meet certain formalities. The note was written, signed, and delivered, so it could work.

Alternatively, if it's a gift, then it's a present transfer. But the proceeds are in the future, so maybe it's a future interest. Gifts can be of future property, but the effectiveness might depend on how it's structured.

Another angle: the friend didn't give anything in exchange, so it's a gratuitous transfer. So perhaps it's a gratuitous assignment. So E or J.

Wait, the difference between E and J. E is a "gratuitous assignment of future rights." J is "irrevocable assignment." Assignments can be revocable unless stated otherwise. So if the note doesn't specify that it's irrevocable, it might be revocable. But some jurisdictions might treat assignments as irrevocable once made, especially if they're in writing and delivered.

But I'm not too sure. Alternatively, since it's a promise to pay a percentage, it's more like a contractual obligation. But without consideration, maybe it's not a contract. Unless the consideration is the friendship or the birthday, but that seems weak.

Another thought: in some cases, a written promise with the intent to be bound can be enforceable under the theory of promissory estoppel, especially if the friend relies on it to their detriment. But the question is about the type of promise, not whether it's enforceable.

Wait, the question asks what it may best be interpreted as. So the options are about the type, not the enforceability.

So if she's assigning 5% of her proceeds, it's an assignment. Since she's not receiving anything, it's gratuitous. So E: gratuitous assignment of future rights.

Alternatively, if it's a gift, then C or G. But a gift of future proceeds is tricky. Assignments are more about transferring rights, while gifts are about transferring ownership.

I think E is the better answer here because she's assigning a portion of her rights to the proceeds, and it's done gratuitously.

The screenwriter's promise to pay 5% of the proceeds from the movie to her friend can best be interpreted as a **gratuitous assignment of future rights**. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Context of the Promise**: The screenwriter wrote and signed a note promising 5% of her future proceeds to her friend, which indicates an intent to transfer a portion of her rights to the friend.

2. **Nature of the Transfer**: The promise involves a percentage of future proceeds, which are not yet in existence. This suggests a transfer of future rights, specifically a portion of what she is entitled to under her agreement with the movie studio.

3. **Gratuitous Nature**: The transfer was made without any consideration from the friend, as it was given as a substitute for a birthday gift. This makes it a gratuitous transfer.

4. **Assignment vs. Gift**: While it could be viewed as a gift, the promise is more accurately characterized as an assignment because it involves the transfer of a specific percentage of future rights rather than an outright transfer of ownership.

5. **Options Analysis**:
   - **E (Gratuitous assignment of future rights)**: This fits because the screenwriter is transferring a portion of her future rights without receiving anything in return.
   - **J (Irrevocable assignment)**: While assignments can sometimes be irrevocable, the question does not specify that the screenwriter intended it to be irrevocable.
   - Other options like "contractual obligation" or "legal gift" are less precise or do not fully capture the nature of the transfer.

Thus, the promise is best interpreted as a **gratuitous assignment of future rights**.
