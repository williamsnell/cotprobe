Question:

A businessman is the owner of a pet products company, which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of a variety of pet supplies. The businessman's company manufactures such products as pet furniture, toys, beds, collars, leashes, cages, and vitamins. These items are distributed to pet stores throughout the United States and Europe. For many years, the company has conducted its operations from a large factory located in a small town in the southern part of the state. One of the businessman's biggest selling products is specially manufactured high-frequency dog-calling whistles. These whistles are sold to dog-training schools and canine divisions of many police departments. Although these whistles are not audible to people, they are audible to dogs over considerable distances. Two years ago, a breeder purchased an undeveloped lot in the small town in which the company's factory was located. On her property, the breeder constructed a pet hotel, which was used as a boarding kennel for dogs and cats. This boarding facility was situated about 100 yards from the company's factory. Unknown to the breeder, high-frequency sound waves often emanated from the company's factory when dog-calling whistles were being tested. These sound waves caused the breeder's dogs to howl uncontrollably for many hours during the day and seriously interfered with the operation of her business. The breeder now brings an action against the businessman and the company to recover damages for the interference with her business caused by the high-frequency sound that reaches her kennel. The court should rule in favor of

Options:

A: the breeder, because the businessman failed to notify the breeder about the high-frequency sound waves.
B: the businessman, because the breeder's business is abnormally sensitive to harm caused by the high-frequency sound waves.
C: the businessman, because the breeder came to the nuisance after his factory had already been in operation for a number of years.
D: the breeder, because the businessman intentionally did not inform about the high-frequency sound waves.
E: the breeder, because the businessman is manufacturing a product that is causing harm to her business.
F: the businessman, because the high-frequency sound waves do not harm people or the environment.
G: the breeder, because the high-frequency sound waves constitute a trespass to her premises.
H: the businessman, because the breeder should have soundproofed her kennel.
I: the businessman, because the breeder should have done a thorough investigation before purchasing the property.

Okay, so I've got this legal question to tackle, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let me read the question again and see what it's about.

So, there's a businessman who owns a pet products company. They make things like pet furniture, toys, beds, collars, leashes, cages, and vitamins. They distribute these to pet stores in the US and Europe. For a long time, they've been operating from a big factory in a small southern town. One of their best-selling products is these high-frequency dog-calling whistles. These whistles aren't audible to humans, but dogs can hear them from far away. They sell these to dog-training schools and police canine units.

Two years ago, a breeder bought an undeveloped lot in the same small town where the factory is. She built a pet hotel there, which is a boarding kennel for dogs and cats. This place is about 100 yards away from the factory. The breeder didn't know that when the company tests the whistles, high-frequency sound waves come out of the factory. These sounds make her dogs howl uncontrollably for hours, which messes with her business. Now, she's suing the businessman and the company for damages caused by this interference.

The question is, who should the court rule in favor of? The options are A to J, but only some are given here.

Alright, so I think this is a nuisance case. Nuisance law deals with situations where someone's use of their property unreasonably interferes with someone else's use of their property. There are two types: private nuisance and public nuisance. Here, it's probably a private nuisance because it's affecting a specific individual (the breeder) rather than the public at large.

So, the key elements for a private nuisance claim are:

1. The defendant's activity must cause a substantial and unreasonable interference.
2. The interference must be with the plaintiff's use and enjoyment of their property.
3. The plaintiff must have standing, meaning they have an interest in the property (like ownership or lease).

In this case, the breeder is the plaintiff. The factory's high-frequency sounds are causing her dogs to howl, which interferes with her business operations. So, that seems to fit the elements.

Now, looking at the defenses or factors that could affect the outcome. One common defense is coming to the nuisance, which is when the plaintiff moves into an area where the nuisance was already present. For example, if someone builds a house next to an existing factory and then complains about the noise, the factory might argue that the plaintiff came to the nuisance.

Another possible defense is whether the activity is abnormally sensitive. If the plaintiff's use of the property is unusually sensitive to interference that wouldn't bother a normal person, then the defendant might not be liable. But in this case, a boarding kennel for dogs is a normal business, so I don't think that applies.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Breeder wins because the businessman didn't notify her. I don't think lack of notification is the main issue here. Nuisance is more about the interference itself, not whether there was notice.

Option B: Businessman wins because breeder's business is abnormally sensitive. As I thought earlier, a kennel isn't abnormally sensitive; it's a normal use. So this might not apply. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe if the kennel is more sensitive to sounds than other businesses, but high-frequency sounds that only dogs can hear might be a different case.

Option C: Businessman wins because breeder came to the nuisance. The factory was there first; she built her kennel later. This is a possible defense, but I think courts don't always accept it. The coming to the nuisance doctrine is more of a factor than an absolute defense. So the court might still find the factory liable if the interference is unreasonable, even if the plaintiff moved in later.

Option D: Breeder wins because businessman intentionally didn't inform her. Again, intent to harm might matter, but in nuisance cases, intent isn't always necessary. It's more about the effect. So this might not be the right reason.

Option E: Breeder wins because the product is causing harm. Well, the product is being tested, and the byproduct (the sound) is causing the harm. So this seems relevant, but I'm not sure if this is the best option.

Option F: Businessman wins because the sounds don't harm people or the environment. But the sounds are harming the breeder's business by affecting the dogs. So this might not be a valid defense. Nuisance can be about interference with use, even if it's not harming people directly.

Option G: Breeder wins because it's trespass. Trespass requires physical invasion. High-frequency sounds are intangible, so probably not trespass. So this option is likely incorrect.

Option H: Businessman wins because breeder should have soundproofed. This is a possible defense, but in nuisance law, the duty is on the defendant to not create a nuisance, not on the plaintiff to protect against it. So the plaintiff doesn't have to take steps to mitigate unless it's reasonable, but the primary liability is on the defendant.

Option I: Businessman wins because breeder should have investigated. Similar to coming to the nuisance. She should have known about the factory, but again, that's more of a factor than an absolute bar.

So, putting this together, the main issue is whether the factory's activity constitutes a nuisance. The sounds are causing substantial interference with the breeder's business. The fact that she came later (option C) might be a consideration, but not necessarily a complete defense.

In some cases, courts have held that coming to a nuisance doesn't automatically mean the plaintiff loses, but it can be a factor in determining reasonableness. So if the factory was there first, but the interference is still unreasonable, the breeder could still win.

But wait, the whistles are tested, and the sounds are a regular part of their operations. So it's an ongoing nuisance. The dogs are howling for hours, which is a significant problem for a boarding kennel. So the interference is substantial and unreasonable.

As for option B, is the breeder's business abnormally sensitive? Dogs are sensitive to sounds that humans can't hear, but a kennel is a normal business. So I don't think B applies.

So, looking at the options again, the best options are either B, C, or E.

Option E says the breeder wins because the product is causing harm. That's a bit vague, but the product's testing is causing the harm. So that's a possible reason.

Option C says the businessman wins because she came to the nuisance. But as I thought, that's not an absolute defense. So it's possible the court would still rule for the breeder.

Wait, but in some jurisdictions, coming to the nuisance is a defense. But others don't consider it a defense if the nuisance is substantial and unreasonable.

So the outcome might depend on whether the court views the coming to the nuisance as a bar. If the court rules that the breeder came after the factory was established, the businessman might win.

But I'm not sure about that. Nuisance cases can be tricky. The key is whether the interference is unreasonable, regardless of who was there first.

Another angle: the factory is emitting high-frequency sounds that are not audible to humans. Does that make it a nuisance? Because the interference is affecting the dogs, which are part of the breeder's business. So the breeder's use and enjoyment is being interfered with because her dogs are howling all the time, disrupting her business operations.

So the factory's activity is causing an unreasonable interference. Therefore, the breeder should win, which would point to options E or C.

But I'm a bit torn between options B, C, and E.

Wait, option B says the breeder's business is abnormally sensitive. So if her business is particularly susceptible to this kind of interference, which a normal business wouldn't be, then the defendant isn't liable. But a kennel is a normal business, and dogs are expected to be there. So the fact that the dogs are affected by sounds humans can't hear doesn't make the business abnormally sensitive. So option B might not apply.

So the best options are C and E.

If the court rules based on coming to the nuisance, it's C. But if they rule based on the unreasonable interference, it's E.

In many cases, coming to the nuisance is not a complete bar but is a factor. So the court could still find the interference unreasonable and rule for the breeder.

But some courts might take the position that the breeder should have known about the factory and its potential impact. So they might side with the businessman.

I'm a bit confused. Let me think about what I remember about nuisance law. The classic case where a plaintiff builds next to an existing nuisance and then sues is sometimes dismissed, but it's not an absolute rule.

In the case of Boomer v. Atlantic Cement Co., the court found that the cement plant could be a nuisance, but because the plaintiffs came after the plant was built, the court allowed nominal damages but not an injunction, and required the plaintiffs to accept compensation instead of shutting down the plant.

But in this case, the breeder is seeking damages, not an injunction. So maybe the court would find that the businessman is liable for the damages caused by the nuisance, regardless of who came first.

So, in that case, the court would rule for the breeder. So the correct answer would be E.

Wait, option E says, "because the businessman is manufacturing a product that is causing harm to her business." That seems correct because the business activity is the source of the nuisance.

Wait, but the product itself isn't the issue; it's the testing of the whistles that's causing the sound waves. So the manufacturing process is causing the interference.

Alternatively, option B is about abnormal sensitivity. I don't think that applies because a kennel is a normal use. So the correct ruling would be for the breeder, making E the correct option.

Wait, but looking back, option C says the breeder came after the factory was there. So the factory had priority. Some courts might side with the factory because the breeder chose to locate there knowing (or should have known) about the factory's operations. But others would still find the interference unreasonable.

In this case, since the factory's activity is causing significant interference, I think the court would find in favor of the breeder despite her coming later. So the answer would be E.

Wait, no. Let me check the options again.

Option E says: the breeder, because the businessman is manufacturing a product that is causing harm to her business.

That's a bit broad. The product isn't directly causing harm; the testing process is. But I think the option is still correct because the manufacturing process (including testing) is part of the business operation.

So, I think the correct answer is E.

Wait, but looking again, the options are A to J, but only up to I are given. So the options are A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I.

Wait, the correct answer is probably E, but let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C, because the breeder came to the nuisance. But I'm not sure.

Wait, in the Boomer case, the court allowed the nuisance to continue but required payment of permanent damages to the plaintiffs, meaning the factory wasn't required to stop operations. So in that case, the plaintiff could recover damages but not get an injunction.

In this question, the breeder is seeking damages, so the court might rule for her, allowing her to recover for the interference, even if she came after the factory was built.

So the correct answer would be E.

Wait, but let me think about the elements again. The key is whether the interference is unreasonable. The factory's activity is causing the breeder's dogs to howl, which is a significant interference with her business. So the court would likely find that it's a nuisance, regardless of who was there first.

So the answer is E: the breeder, because the businessman is manufacturing a product that is causing harm to her business.

Wait, but the product itself isn't the problem; it's the testing of the whistles. So maybe the option is a bit off, but it's the closest.

Alternatively, maybe another option is better. Let me check all options again.

Option C: the businessman, because the breeder came to the nuisance after his factory had been in operation for a number of years.

So that's the coming to the nuisance defense. As I mentioned, some courts might accept this, others might not. But in the absence of more factors, I think the correct answer is C, because the breeder came after the factory was established, so the court might rule in favor of the businessman.

Wait, I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. On one hand, the interference is real and substantial. On the other, the breeder chose to locate her business near an existing factory.

I think in this scenario, the court would likely rule in favor of the breeder because the interference is unreasonable and substantial, regardless of who was there first.

But I'm not entirely certain. Another angle: the high-frequency sounds are not audible to humans, so other businesses or residents might not be affected. But the breeder's business is particularly impacted because she has dogs. So is that abnormal sensitivity?

If the court decides that a kennel is abnormally sensitive, then option B would apply, and the businessman would win. But I don't think that's the case. Kennels are common businesses, and having dogs is normal.

So, I think the correct answer is E: the breeder, because the businessman is manufacturing a product that is causing harm to her business.

Wait, but the actual issue is the testing of the product, not the product itself. So maybe the option isn't perfect, but it's the best fit.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C, that the breeder came to the nuisance, so the businessman wins.

I think I need to decide. From what I remember, the coming to the nuisance is a factor but not an absolute defense. So the court may still find the interference unreasonable and rule for the breeder.

So the answer is E.
</think>

The question revolves around a nuisance claim brought by a breeder against a businessman and his company. The factory produces high-frequency dog-calling whistles, which emit sound waves inaudible to humans but audible to dogs. These sounds cause the breeder's dogs to howl uncontrollably, interfering with her business. The key issue is whether the court should rule in favor of the breeder or the businessman.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**: Suggests the breeder wins because the businessman failed to notify her about the high-frequency sound waves. However, lack of notification is not the central issue in nuisance cases. The focus is on whether the interference is substantial and unreasonable, not on whether notice was given. This option is incorrect.

2. **Option B**: Argues the businessman wins because the breeder's business is abnormally sensitive to harm. A boarding kennel is a normal business, and the presence of dogs is expected. The sensitivity to high-frequency sounds does not make the business abnormally sensitive. Thus, this option is also incorrect.

3. **Option C**: States the businessman wins because the breeder came to the nuisance after the factory was already operating. While "coming to the nuisance" can be a factor, it is not an absolute defense. Courts often prioritize whether the interference is unreasonable and substantial over the order of establishment. This makes the option plausible but not definitive.

4. **Option D**: Claims the breeder wins because the businessman intentionally did not inform her about the high-frequency sound waves. Intent is not the primary consideration in nuisance cases; the focus is on the effect of the interference. This option is incorrect.

5. **Option E**: Suggests the breeder wins because the businessman is manufacturing a product that is causing harm to her business. This is the strongest option. The factory's activity (testing the whistles) causes substantial and unreasonable interference with the breeder's business, fulfilling the elements of a private nuisance claim.

6. **Option F**: Argues the businessman wins because the high-frequency sound waves do not harm people or the environment. This is irrelevant, as the interference with the breeder's business is sufficient to establish a nuisance. This option is incorrect.

7. **Option G**: Claims the breeder wins because the high-frequency sound waves constitute a trespass. Trespass requires a physical invasion, while high-frequency sounds are intangible. This option is incorrect.

8. **Option H**: Suggests the businessman wins because the breeder should have soundproofed her kennel. In nuisance law, the burden is on the defendant to avoid creating a nuisance, not on the plaintiff to mitigate the harm. This option is incorrect.

9. **Option I**: Argues the businessman wins because the breeder should have investigated the property before purchasing it. While a lack of due diligence might be a factor, it does not bar a nuisance claim if the interference is unreasonable. This option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The interference caused by the high-frequency sound waves is substantial and unreasonable, and the breeder's business is not abnormally sensitive. While the "coming to the nuisance" defense (Option C) is a factor, it is not an absolute bar. The court is likely to rule in favor of the breeder because the businessman's manufacturing activity is causing harm to her business. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**E: the breeder, because the businessman is manufacturing a product that is causing harm to her business.**
