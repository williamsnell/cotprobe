Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The reaction is 2KClO3(s) → 2KCl(s) + 3O2(g). So potassium chlorate is decomposing into potassium chloride and oxygen gas. The oxygen is collected via water displacement, and the conditions are 20°C with a pressure of 753 mm Hg. They also mention the vapor pressure of water at that temperature is 17.5 mm Hg. The initial mass of KClO3 is 1.28 grams. They want to find the volume of gas produced. The options are given from A to J, each with different volumes in milliliters.

Alright, so I think the steps I need to take are:

1. **Calculate moles of KClO3:** Since the reaction starts with a known mass, I'll need to convert that mass into moles. Molar mass calculations will be necessary here.

2. **Use stoichiometry to find moles of O2 produced:** The balanced equation shows that 2 moles of KClO3 produce 3 moles of O2. So I can find the moles of O2 based on the moles of KClO3.

3. **Adjust the pressure for water vapor:** The total pressure observed is 753 mm Hg, but this includes water vapor. Since the actual pressure of the O2 is the total minus the vapor pressure, I'll subtract 17.5 mm Hg from 753 mm Hg to get the pressure of just O2.

4. **Convert pressure to atmospheres:** Because the gas constant R is given in L-atm/(mol·K), I'll need to convert the pressure from mm Hg to atm.

5. **Use the ideal gas law to find volume:** With moles, pressure in atm, temperature in Kelvin, and R known, I can plug into PV = nRT to solve for V.

Let me go through each step in detail.

**Step 1: Moles of KClO3**

The molar mass of KClO3. Let's calculate that.

K is about 39.1 g/mol,
Cl is 35.45 g/mol,
O is 16.00 g/mol, and there are 3 O atoms.

So molar mass = 39.1 + 35.45 + (3*16) = 39.1 + 35.45 = 74.55, plus 48 (3*16) gives 122.55 g/mol.

So moles of KClO3 = mass / molar mass = 1.28 g / 122.55 g/mol.

Let me compute that. 1.28 divided by 122.55. Hmm, 122.55 is approximately 122.56. Let me do the division:

1.28 / 122.55 ≈ 0.01044 moles.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me calculate it more accurately.

122.55 times 0.01 is 1.2255, which is less than 1.28. The difference is 1.28 - 1.2255 = 0.0545. So 0.0545 / 122.55 ≈ 0.000445. So total moles ≈ 0.010445, roughly 0.01044 moles.

**Step 2: Moles of O2**

From the balanced equation, 2 moles KClO3 → 3 moles O2. So moles of O2 = (3/2) * moles of KClO3.

So 0.01044 moles KClO3 * (3/2) = 0.01566 moles O2.

Wait, 3/2 is 1.5, so 0.01044 * 1.5 = 0.01566. Got it.

**Step 3: Adjust pressure for water vapor**

The total pressure is 753 mm Hg, but this includes water vapor. So the pressure of just O2 is 753 - 17.5 = 735.5 mm Hg.

Wait, yes. So P_O2 = 753 -17.5 = 735.5 mm Hg.

**Step 4: Convert pressure to atm**

I know that 1 atm = 760 mm Hg. So to convert mm Hg to atm, divide by 760.

So P = 735.5 / 760 ≈ let me compute that.

735.5 divided by 760. Let me approximate.

760 -735.5=24.5. So 735.5=760-24.5. So 735.5/760 = (760-24.5)/760=1 - (24.5/760).

24.5/760 is approximately 0.03224. So 1 - 0.03224 ≈ 0.96776 atm.

Alternatively, 735.5 ÷760 = let me compute it more accurately.

735.5 ÷760: Let me compute 735 ÷760 = 0.9671. Wait, 760 *0.9671 is 735. So 735.5 is 735 +0.5, so 0.5/760=0.000657. So 0.9671 + 0.000657 ≈ 0.96776 atm.

So P ≈ 0.96776 atm.

**Step 5: Use ideal gas law**

PV = nRT → V = nRT/P.

We have n = 0.01566 moles, R=0.0821 L·atm/mol·K, T=20°C which is 293.15 K.

Plugging in:

V = (0.01566 mol) * (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K) * (293.15 K) / (0.96776 atm).

Let me compute the numerator first.

0.01566 * 0.0821 = let's compute that.

0.01566 * 0.08 = approx 0.0012528, and 0.01566 * 0.0021= approx 0.000032886. So total ≈ 0.0012528 + 0.000032886 = 0.001285686.

Then multiply by 293.15 K:

0.001285686 * 293.15 ≈ Let me compute that.

0.001285686 * 293 = approx 0.3767 liters? Wait, more accurately:

Wait, 0.001285686 * 293.15 → Let me compute:

0.001285686 is approximately 1.285686e-3.

Multiply 1.285686e-3 by 293.15:

1.285686e-3 * 293.15 ≈ 1.285686 * 293.15 * 1e-3.

1.285686 * 293 = let's compute 1 *293=293, 0.285686*293≈ 0.285686 * 300=85.7, but minus 0.285686 *7=2. So approx 85.7 -2=83.7. So 293 +83.7=376.7. So 376.7 *1e-3=0.3767 liters.

Then, divide by P (0.96776 atm):

0.3767 L / 0.96776 atm ≈ approximately 0.389 liters.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

0.3767 / 0.96776 → Let me do the division.

0.96776 × 0.389 → let me see: 0.96776 * 0.38 = 0.96776 * 0.3 =0.29033, 0.96776 *0.08=0.07742; sum is 0.29033+0.07742=0.36775. So 0.38 gives 0.36775, which is less than 0.3767. The difference is 0.3767-0.36775=0.00895.

So 0.00895 / 0.96776 ≈ 0.00925. So total is approximately 0.38 + 0.00925 = 0.38925 liters.

Which is 389.25 milliliters.

Looking at the options, option C is 390 ml, which is very close. So the answer should be option C.

Wait, but I should check my calculations again because sometimes approximations can lead to slight errors.

Let me redo the P calculation accurately.

P_O2 =735.5 mmHg. To atm: 735.5 /760 = 0.967763 atm.

n=0.01566 mol.

R=0.0821.

T=293.15 K.

So V = (0.01566)(0.0821)(293.15) / 0.967763.

Compute numerator: 0.01566 *0.0821 = ?

0.01566 *0.08 = 0.0012528.

0.01566 *0.0021=0.000032886.

Sum to 0.0012528 + 0.000032886 = 0.001285686.

Multiply by 293.15: 0.001285686 *293.15.

Let me compute 0.001285686 *293.15.

Compute 0.001285686 *293 = 0.001285686 * 200=0.257137, plus 0.001285686 *93 =0.1195. So total 0.257137 + 0.1195=0.376637.

Then 0.001285686 *0.15=0.00019285.

So total numerator is 0.376637 +0.00019285≈0.37683 liters.

Now, V=0.37683 / 0.967763 ≈ ?

Compute 0.37683 /0.967763.

Let me write it as 376.83 /967.763 ≈ 0.389 liters.

So 389 ml, which is option C:390 ml.

Wait, but wait, maybe I should be more precise with the initial moles.

Let me recalculate the moles of KClO3.

Molar mass of KClO3: K=39.10, Cl=35.45, O=16.00*3=48. So total 39.1 +35.45=74.55 +48=122.55 g/mol.

Mass is 1.28 g. So moles=1.28 /122.55.

Let me compute that precisely. 1.28 ÷122.55.

122.55 goes into 1.28 zero times. Put a decimal: 12.8 divided by 122.55 is about 0.104 (since 122.55 *0.1=12.255, so 12.8-12.255=0.545 remains). So 0.104... but wait, actually, it's 1.28 g /122.55 g/mol.

Wait, 122.55 is approximately 122.55, so 1.28 /122.55 is 0.01044? Wait, 122.55 *0.01 is 1.2255, so 0.01 is 1.2255. 1.28 is 1.28 -1.2255=0.0545. So 0.0545 /122.55 = approx 0.000445. So 0.01 +0.000445=0.010445 moles.

So moles of KClO3=0.010445.

Moles of O2= (3/2)*0.010445=0.0156675 mol.

So n=0.0156675.

Then, V= (0.0156675 *0.0821 *293.15) /0.967763.

Let me compute numerator again with more precise n.

0.0156675 *0.0821 = ?

0.01 *0.0821=0.000821.

0.0056675 *0.0821= let's compute 0.005 *0.0821=0.0004105; 0.0006675 *0.0821= approx 0.0000548.

So 0.0004105 +0.0000548=0.0004653. Sum with 0.000821 gives 0.0012863.

Multiply by 293.15:

0.0012863 *293.15.

Let me compute 0.0012863 *293= ?

0.001 *293=0.293, 0.0002863*293≈0.0839. So total ≈0.293 +0.0839=0.3769.

0.0012863 *0.15=0.0001929. So total numerator≈0.3769+0.0001929≈0.3771.

Then V=0.3771 /0.967763≈0.3896 liters, which is 389.6 ml. So approximately 390 ml.

Therefore, the correct answer is C:390 ml.

To determine the volume of oxygen gas produced, the following steps were carried out:

1. **Calculate moles of KClO₃**:  
   The molar mass of KClO₃ is calculated as:  
   \[
   \text{Molar mass of } KClO_3 = 39.1 \, (\text{K}) + 35.45 \, (\text{Cl}) + 3 \times 16.0 \, (\text{O}) = 122.55 \, \text{g/mol}.
   \]  
   The moles of KClO₃ are:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of } KClO_3 = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar mass}} = \frac{1.28 \, \text{g}}{122.55 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 0.01044 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

2. **Use stoichiometry to find moles of O₂**:  
   From the balanced equation \( 2KClO_3 \rightarrow 2KCl + 3O_2 \), 2 moles of KClO₃ produce 3 moles of O₂. Thus, the moles of O₂ are:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of } O_2 = \frac{3}{2} \times \text{Moles of } KClO_3 = \frac{3}{2} \times 0.01044 \approx 0.01566 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

3. **Adjust pressure for water vapor**:  
   The total pressure collected is 753 mm Hg, which includes water vapor. The pressure of O₂ is:  
   \[
   P_{O_2} = 753 \, \text{mm Hg} - 17.5 \, \text{mm Hg} = 735.5 \, \text{mm Hg}.
   \]

4. **Convert pressure to atmospheres**:  
   Convert \( P_{O_2} \) from mm Hg to atm using \( 1 \, \text{atm} = 760 \, \text{mm Hg} \):  
   \[
   P_{O_2} = \frac{735.5}{760} \approx 0.96776 \, \text{atm}.
   \]

5. **Use the ideal gas law to find volume**:  
   The ideal gas law is \( PV = nRT \), where \( R = 0.0821 \, \text{L-atm/(mol·K)} \) and \( T = 20^\circ \text{C} = 293.15 \, \text{K} \). Solving for \( V \):  
   \[
   V = \frac{nRT}{P}.
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   V = \frac{(0.01566 \, \text{mol})(0.0821 \, \text{L-atm/(mol·K)})(293.15 \, \text{K})}{0.96776 \, \text{atm}}.
   \]  
   First, calculate the numerator:  
   \[
   nRT = (0.01566)(0.0821)(293.15) \approx 0.3768 \, \text{L}.
   \]  
   Then, divide by \( P \):  
   \[
   V = \frac{0.3768}{0.96776} \approx 0.389 \, \text{L}.
   \]  
   Convert to milliliters:  
   \[
   V \approx 389 \, \text{mL}.
   \]

The closest option to the calculated volume is **390 mL**.  

**Answer: C**
