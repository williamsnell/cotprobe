Okay, so I've got this problem about depreciation, and I'm a bit new to accounting, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The radio station bought a stereo system for $8,400. It's expected to last 6 years and have a residual value of $1,200. But wait, there's a catch: because the needles wear out fast, there's an additional 20% depreciation in the first year. And the question is asking for the total depreciation in the first year using the straight-line basis.

Hmm, straight-line depreciation. From what I remember, straight-line is when you spread the depreciation evenly over the life of the asset. So normally, the formula would be (Cost - Residual) / Life. But wait, the twist here is the additional 20% depreciation in the first year. So I think I need to calculate two parts: the regular straight-line depreciation for the first year and then add that extra 20% of the depreciation.

Wait, no, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. The problem says there's an "additional 20% depreciation in the first year." So does that mean that in the first year, the depreciation is 20% higher than usual, or is it an extra 20% of the asset's cost?

I'm a bit confused. Let me try to clarify. Normally, without any additional depreciation, the straight-line would be (Cost - Residual) / Life. So that would be (8,400 - 1,200) / 6 = 7,200 / 6 = $1,200 per year. So each year, the depreciation expense is $1,200.

But wait, the first year has an additional 20% depreciation. So does that mean the first year is 20% higher than the usual straight-line amount, making it 1,200 * 1.20 = $1,440? Or is it an extra 20% of the asset's cost, which would be 0.20 * 8,400 = $1,680, and then added to the regular depreciation of $1,200, making the first year's total depreciation $2,880? That seems high.

Alternatively, maybe the additional 20% is on the depreciation amount, not the cost. So perhaps the first year's depreciation is 120% of the normal straight-line. So 1,200 * 1.2 = 1,440. Then the subsequent years would be the regular 1,200 each.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes, when you have additional depreciation, like in the first year, it's sometimes called "additional depreciation" over and above the regular amount. So perhaps the first year's depreciation is 1,200 (straight-line) plus 20% of that, which is 240, making it 1,440. So that would be option C: $1,440.

But wait, another approach: perhaps the 20% is a separate depreciation on the cost. Let me think. The asset cost is 8,400. If there's an additional 20% depreciation in the first year, maybe that's 20% of 8,400, which is 1,680. So the total depreciation in the first year would be the regular straight-line (1,200) plus 1,680, which equals 2,880. But I don't see that as an option. The options go up to 3,360 (option D) and 5,520 (E). So maybe I'm miscalculating here.

Wait, perhaps the 20% is calculated not on the cost but on the straight-line depreciation. So the straight-line is 1,200 per year. The additional 20% would be 0.2 * 1,200 = 240. So the first year's depreciation is 1,200 + 240 = 1,440, which is option C.

But wait, another angle: sometimes, the first year's depreciation is calculated differently. For example, in some cases, when using straight-line, the first year is prorated based on the month of purchase, but this problem doesn't mention that. It just says an additional 20% depreciation in the first year. So perhaps it's an extra 20% of the asset's cost.

Wait, 20% of 8,400 is 1,680. If that's the case, then the total depreciation in the first year would be 1,680 (the extra) plus the regular straight-line depreciation for the first year, which is 1,200. So 1,200 + 1,680 equals 2,880. But I don't see 2,880 as an option. The closest is option D: 3,360 and option H: 3,000. Hmm, so maybe that's not the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the additional 20% is applied to the straight-line depreciation. So for the first year, instead of 1,200, it's 1,200 plus 20% of 1,200, which is 1,440. So that would be option C.

But wait, another possibility: maybe the 20% is of the cost, so 8,400 * 0.2 = 1,680. So the first year's depreciation is 1,680, and then the remaining depreciation is spread over the next 5 years. But that doesn't fit the straight-line basis as described.

Wait, the problem says "using the straight-line basis." So perhaps the additional 20% is a one-time adjustment in the first year. So perhaps the total depreciation for the first year is the straight-line amount (1,200) plus the additional 20% of (8,400 - 1,200) / 6? No, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe the 20% is applied to the cost, but only in the first year. So the first year's depreciation is 20% of 8,400 = 1,680. Then, the remaining book value after first year would be 8,400 - 1,680 = 6,720. Then, the residual is 1,200, so the remaining depreciable amount is 6,720 - 1,200 = 5,520, spread over 5 years. So 5,520 / 5 = 1,104 per year for years 2-6. But wait, that's not the straight-line method as per the question. The question specifies using straight-line, so this approach might not fit.

Hmm, perhaps the question is referring to the straight-line method, but with an additional 20% depreciation in the first year. So the total depreciation in the first year is the straight-line amount plus 20% of that amount. So 1,200 + (0.2 * 1,200) = 1,200 + 240 = 1,440. So that would be option C.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option C is $1,440, which matches this calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the additional 20% is based on the cost. So 20% of 8,400 is 1,680, and that's the total depreciation for the first year. That would make the first year's depreciation 1,680. But looking at the options, option F is $1,680. So that's another possibility.

But wait, the question says it's using the straight-line basis. So the straight-line method would normally give 1,200 per year. The additional 20% depreciation in the first yearâ€”does that mean that the first year's depreciation is 120% of the usual straight-line, or an extra 20% on top of the straight-line?

If it's an extra 20%, then it's 1,200 + (0.2 * 1,200) = 1,440, which is option C.

But if the additional 20% is calculated on the cost, making the first year's depreciation 1,680, that's option F. But that doesn't align with the straight-line method.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the straight-line depreciation first, then add the 20%. Let me think again.

Straight-line depreciation per year is (Cost - Residual) / Life = (8,400 - 1,200)/6 = 7,200/6 = 1,200 per year.

But the problem says there's an additional 20% depreciation in the first year. So that might mean that in the first year, the depreciation is 1,200 plus 20% of 1,200, which is 240, so 1,440 total for the first year.

That would make the answer option C: $1,440.

Alternatively, perhaps the 20% is of the asset's cost, so 8,400 * 0.2 = 1,680. So the first year's depreciation is 1,680. But that would mean that the straight-line method is being adjusted, which might not fit the standard approach.

Wait, but the problem says "using the straight-line basis." So perhaps the 20% is an additional depreciation on top of the straight-line. So first, compute the straight-line for the first year: 1,200. Then, add the additional 20% depreciation. But wait, is that 20% of the asset's cost or of the straight-line amount?

I think it's more likely that the additional 20% is on the straight-line depreciation. So 1,200 * 1.2 = 1,440.

Yes, that makes sense. So the first year's total depreciation is 1,440, which is option C.

The problem involves calculating the total depreciation for the first year of a stereo system purchased for $8,400, with an estimated life of 6 years and a residual value of $1,200. The straight-line method is used, but there is an additional 20% depreciation in the first year due to fast wear of needles.

Under the straight-line method, the annual depreciation is calculated as:

\[
\text{Annual Depreciation} = \frac{\text{Cost} - \text{Residual Value}}{\text{Life}} = \frac{8,400 - 1,200}{6} = 1,200
\]

The problem specifies an additional 20% depreciation in the first year. This additional depreciation is applied to the straight-line depreciation amount. Therefore, the additional depreciation is:

\[
\text{Additional Depreciation} = 0.20 \times 1,200 = 240
\]

The total depreciation for the first year is the sum of the straight-line depreciation and the additional depreciation:

\[
\text{Total Depreciation (First Year)} = 1,200 + 240 = 1,440
\]

Thus, the total depreciation for the first year is **$1,440**, which corresponds to **Option C**.
