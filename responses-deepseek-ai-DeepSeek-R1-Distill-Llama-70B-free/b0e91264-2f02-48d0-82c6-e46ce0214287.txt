Question:

Two cousins took title to real estate as joint tenants with the right of survivorship. The first cousin put up his interest in the joint tenancy as security for a $20,000 loan and signed a judgment note. It was later entered as a judgment against the first cousin's interest in the real estate. The first cousin died a year later. The second cousin decided to sell the property, but the mortgagee filed an action to prevent the sale and to enforce his interest in the property. The second cousin defended on the basis that any lien on the first cousin's interest in the property was extinguished on the first cousin's death. Will the court enforce the lien of the mortgagee against the sale of the property by the surviving second cousin?

Options:

A: Yes, because the second cousin's assent to the judgment lien was presumed by law and that assent destroyed the joint tenancy.
B: Yes, because the mortgagee has the right to enforce his interest in the property to recover the loan.
C: No, because a joint tenant cannot legally file a judgment note on just that joint tenant's interest because it would be an unconstitutional interference with the other's property rights.
D: No, because when the first cousin died the second cousin became the sole owner due to the right of survivorship, as per the joint tenancy which was still fully intact.
E: Yes, because a mortgage or judgment lien against one joint tenant destroys the tenancy and destroys the right of survivorship.
F: No, because the first cousin's debt did not affect the second cousin's rights to the property.
G: Yes, because the mortgagee has a valid claim to the property due to the first cousin's unpaid loan.
H: Yes, because the first cousin's debt was not settled before his death, hence the property cannot be sold until the debt is settled.
I: No, because the second cousin did not have knowledge of the first cousin's debt before his death.

Okay, so I've got this real estate question here about joint tenancy and liens. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

So, the setup is that two cousins own real estate as joint tenants with right of survivorship. That means when one dies, the other gets the entire property, right? No probate, just automatically.

The first cousin used his interest as security for a $20,000 loan and signed a judgment note. So, he probably took out a mortgage on his share. Then, a judgment was entered against his interest in the real estate. Later, the first cousin dies, and the second cousin wants to sell the property. But the mortgagee (the lender) is trying to stop the sale and enforce their interest.

The question is whether the court will enforce the lien against the sale by the surviving cousin.

I remember that in joint tenancy, the key feature is the right of survivorship. So when one dies, the other owns the whole property. But what about when one of them has a lien or mortgage on their interest?

Wait, when a joint tenant mortgages their interest, what happens? I think that a lien on one joint tenant's interest can affect the property. Because if the debtor dies, the creditor can still go after the property because the lien survives. Or does it?

Alternatively, when one joint tenant dies, their interest effectively ceases to exist because the survivor takes everything. So any liens on the deceased's interest would be extinguished because that interest is gone. But I'm not entirely sure.

Let me think about how liens work. A mortgage is a lien on the title. If the first cousin mortgages his interest, that creates a lien on his share. But when he dies, under joint tenancy, his share goes to the survivor. So does the lien go with it?

Wait, but wait. I remember something about severing the joint tenancy. If one joint tenant mortgages their interest, does that sever the tenancy? Or does it just create a lien that can be enforced against that tenant's interest.

I think that when a joint tenant mortgages their interest, it doesn't sever the tenancy but creates a lien on their interest. So if the debtor dies, the lien would still attach to the interest, but since the interest passed to the survivor via survivorship, the lien might still be valid against the entire property, or maybe not.

Wait, no. If the first cousin dies, the second cousin owns the whole property. But the mortgage was on the first cousin's interest, which no longer exists. So the lien would be extinguished because the debtor's interest is gone. So the mortgagee can't enforce against the survivor.

But wait, some sources say that a lien on one joint tenant's interest can be enforced against the survivor because the lien is on the specific interest. Or maybe not. I'm getting confused.

Let me look at the options given. The options are A to J, but the possible correct answers are among them.

Option D says no because upon death, the second cousin becomes sole owner, so the lien is extinguished. That aligns with what I was thinking earlier.

Option E says yes because the mortgage lien destroys the tenancy and survivorship. But I don't think a mortgage severs the joint tenancy. Severance usually requires a conveyance, like selling one's interest. A mortgage might create a lien but doesn't sever the tenancy.

Option B says yes because the mortgagee has the right to enforce. But if the first cousin's interest is gone, there's nothing to enforce against, unless the lien somehow attaches to the entire property.

Wait, another angle: when the first cousin took out the mortgage, he only had an interest as a joint tenant. Upon his death, the second cousin owns the whole property. So the mortgagee's lien was on the first cousin's share, which is now gone. So the lien can't attach to the survivor's interest because the survivor's interest was already 100% after the death.

Therefore, the mortgagee can't enforce the lien against the survivor's interest. So the court would say no, the lien is extinguished upon the first cousin's death.

Looking back at the options, option D says no because the joint tenancy was intact, so the second cousin is sole owner. Option F says no because the first cousin's debt doesn't affect the second cousin's rights. Option D seems more accurate because it's about the survivorship making the second cousin sole owner.

So the correct answer should be D.

In this scenario, two cousins owned real estate as joint tenants with the right of survivorship. The first cousin mortgaged his interest to secure a $20,000 loan, and a judgment lien was later entered against his interest. Upon the first cousin's death, the second cousin became the sole owner of the property due to the right of survivorship. The question is whether the mortgagee can enforce the lien against the property when the second cousin decides to sell it.

Key points to consider:

1. **Joint Tenancy and Right of Survivorship**: In a joint tenancy, when one tenant dies, the surviving tenant automatically owns the entire property. The deceased tenant's interest ceases to exist and cannot be subjected to claims against their estate.

2. **Effect of a Mortgage or Judgment Lien on Joint Tenancy**: A mortgage or judgment lien on one joint tenant's interest does not sever the joint tenancy. However, upon the death of the debtor tenant, their interest is extinguished, and the lien cannot survive against the surviving tenant's interest because the lien was specific to the deceased tenant's share.

3. **Analysis of Options**:
   - **Option D**: Correct. Upon the first cousin's death, the second cousin became the sole owner of the property due to the right of survivorship. The lien on the first cousin's interest was extinguished because their interest no longer exists.
   - **Option E**: Incorrect. A mortgage or judgment lien on one joint tenant's interest does not destroy the joint tenancy or the right of survivorship.
   - **Option B and G**: Incorrect. While the mortgagee has a valid claim, it is limited to the first cousin's interest, which no longer exists after his death.
   - **Option F**: Incorrect. While the second cousin's rights are unaffected, this option does not address the legal effect of the lien on the first cousin's interest.
   - **Options A, C, H, I**: Incorrect for similar reasons as above.

The correct answer is that the court will not enforce the lien because the first cousin's interest was extinguished upon his death, leaving the second cousin as the sole owner of the property.
