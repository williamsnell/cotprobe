Okay, so I have this question about SCRs and their surge current ratings. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through. The question says that an SCR has a half cycle surge current rating of 3000 A for a 50 Hz supply. And they're asking what the one cycle surge current would be.

Wait, I remember that surge current ratings are related to the time the current is applied. SCRs can handle higher currents for shorter durations. The half cycle and one cycle probably refer to the AC supply's cycles. So 50 Hz means each cycle is 20 milliseconds because the period T is 1/f, which is 1/50 = 0.02 seconds or 20 ms.

Half a cycle would be 10 ms, and one cycle is 20 ms. So the surge current is the maximum current the SCR can handle without damage for that specific pulse duration.

I think the key here is understanding how the surge current rating scales with the duration. I remember something about the surge current being inversely proportional to the square root of the time. Or wait, maybe it's directly proportional to the square root of the inverse of time? Or perhaps it's a matter of the rms value over time.

Wait, another approach: The maximum surge current is usually given for a specific time, like half a cycle. So if the time doubles, how does the current change? I think the formula might be something like I1 / sqrt(t1) = I2 / sqrt(t2), where I is the current and t is the time.

So in this case, let's plug in the numbers. The initial current I1 is 3000 A for a half cycle, which is 10 ms (t1=0.01 s). We need to find I2 for a full cycle, t2=0.02 s.

So using the formula: I1/sqrt(t1) = I2/sqrt(t2)
=> 3000 / sqrt(0.01) = I2 / sqrt(0.02)
Wait, sqrt(0.01) is 0.1, sqrt(0.02) is approximately 0.1414.

So 3000 / 0.1 = I2 / 0.1414
=> 30000 = I2 / 0.1414
=> I2 = 30000 * 0.1414 ≈ 4242.64 A.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is 4242.64 A. But wait, that's for one cycle. So the one cycle surge current would be around 4242.64 A.

But wait another thought—am I remembering the formula correctly? Because I've also heard that the surge current rating is proportional to the square root of the time duration. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think again.

The formula I thought of was I1 * sqrt(t1) = I2 * sqrt(t2), which would imply that a longer time allows a lower current. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Because for longer pulses, the device can handle less current. So if I have a longer time, the maximum allowable current would decrease.

Wait, wait, perhaps the formula is I ∝ 1 / sqrt(t). So for a longer time, the maximum current decreases. So if the time doubles, the maximum current would be multiplied by sqrt(2) in the denominator, meaning it's divided by sqrt(2).

So in the initial situation, for t1 = 0.01 s, I1 is 3000 A.

For t2 = 0.02 s (double the time), I2 would be I1 * sqrt(t1/t2).

So I2 = 3000 * sqrt(0.01/0.02) = 3000 * sqrt(0.5) ≈ 3000 * 0.7071 ≈ 2121.32 A.

Wait, but that gives me a lower current for a longer time, which makes sense. But the question is about one cycle surge current when the half cycle is given.

Wait, but wait, the surge current for a longer duration is lower. So when the duration is longer, the maximum current the device can handle without damage is lower.

So the half cycle is 10 ms, and the one cycle is 20 ms. So the surge current for one cycle would be less than 3000 A? But looking at the options, option A is 2121.32 A, which is lower than 3000.

Wait, but in the initial approach, I came up with 4242 A, but that was when the formula was I1/sqrt(t1) = I2/sqrt(t2), which gave a higher current for a longer time, which doesn't make sense. So I must have gotten the formula wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is that the maximum surge current is proportional to 1/(sqrt(t)). So I = k / sqrt(t), where k is a constant.

So for t1 = 0.01 s, I1 = 3000 = k / sqrt(0.01) → k = 3000 * 0.1 = 300.

Then for t2 = 0.02 s, I2 = 300 / sqrt(0.02) → sqrt(0.02) is approx 0.1414. So I2 ≈ 300 / 0.1414 ≈ 2121.32 A.

So that would make the one cycle surge current about 2121 A, which is option A.

But wait, I'm getting conflicting results based on different formulas. Which one is correct?

Another way to think: the surge current rating is usually the peak current that can be handled for a specific pulse duration. The rating is often given for a half-cycle (10 ms for 50 Hz) because that's a common case.

The maximum allowable current decreases as the pulse duration increases because the device has more time to heat up, and higher currents for longer times could cause thermal failure.

So if the half-cycle (10 ms) rating is 3000 A, then for a full cycle (20 ms), the allowable current would be lower.

Using the formula I = I_rated * sqrt(t_rated / t_new), because as time increases, current decreases.

So I_new = 3000 A * sqrt(0.01 s / 0.02 s) = 3000 * sqrt(0.5) ≈ 3000 * 0.7071 ≈ 2121.32 A.

So the one cycle surge current would be approximately 2121.32 A, which is option A.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option H is 4242.64 A. Oh wait, that's the value I got when I did the initial incorrect approach where I thought the current increased with time. But that doesn't make sense because longer pulses should allow lower currents.

So the correct approach is the one where the current decreases with the square root of time. So the correct answer would be option A: 2121.32 A.

Wait, but wait another thought. I've also heard that the surge current is sometimes given as the maximum for a specific time, and if the time is longer, the current is less. So the one cycle would have a lower current than the half cycle.

Wait, no, the half cycle is shorter, so the surge current allowed is higher. So when the time is longer, the maximum current is lower.

So the half cycle is 10 ms, 3000 A. One cycle is 20 ms, which is longer, so the current would be lower.

So using the formula I2 = I1 * sqrt(t1/t2), which is 3000 * sqrt(0.01/0.02) = 3000 * 0.7071 ≈ 2121 A.

That's option A. So the answer should be A.

To determine the one cycle surge current rating of an SCR, we start with the given half cycle surge current rating of 3000 A for a 50 Hz supply. At 50 Hz, one cycle is 20 ms, and half a cycle is 10 ms. The surge current rating is inversely proportional to the square root of the time duration, following the formula:

\[
I_2 = I_1 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{t_1}{t_2}}
\]

Here:
- \(I_1 = 3000 \, \text{A}\) (half cycle surge current),
- \(t_1 = 0.01 \, \text{s}\) (half cycle duration),
- \(t_2 = 0.02 \, \text{s}\) (one cycle duration).

Substituting the values:

\[
I_2 = 3000 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{0.01}{0.02}} = 3000 \cdot \sqrt{0.5} \approx 3000 \cdot 0.7071 \approx 2121.32 \, \text{A}.
\]

Thus, the one cycle surge current rating is approximately 2121.32 A. This matches option A.
