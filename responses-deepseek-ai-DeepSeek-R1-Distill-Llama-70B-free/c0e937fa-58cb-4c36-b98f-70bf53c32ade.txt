Okay, so I've got this problem here: I need to find the maximum possible order for an element of S_n when n is 6. The options are A through J, with various numbers. Hmm, I remember that S_n is the symmetric group, which consists of all permutations of n elements. Each permutation has an order, which is the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of its cycles when written in cycle notation.

Wait, right, the order of a permutation is the LCM of its cycle lengths. So to find the maximum order in S_6, I need to find the permutation whose cycle structure gives the highest possible LCM.

Let me think. S_6 means we're dealing with permutations of 6 elements. So the possible cycle structures are the partitions of 6. Each partition corresponds to a different type of permutation. For example, a single 6-cycle, or a 3-cycle plus a 2-cycle and a 1-cycle, etc.

I remember that the maximum order in S_n is found by considering integer partitions of n and calculating the LCM for each. The maximum of those LCMs will be the answer.

So for n=6, the possible integer partitions are:

1. 6
2. 5 +1
3. 4 +2
4. 4 +1 +1
5. 3 +3
6. 3 +2 +1
7. 3 +1 +1 +1
8. 2 +2 +2
9. 2 +2 +1 +1
10. 2 +1 +1 +1 +1
11. 1+1+1+1+1+1

But wait, not all of these are unique. For example, 4+2 is the same as 2+4, but since order doesn't matter in partitions, we can ignore the order.

Now, I need to compute the LCM for each of these and find the maximum. Let me list them with their LCMs.

1. 6: LCM(6) =6
2. 5+1: LCM(5,1)=5
3. 4+2: LCM(4,2)=4 (Wait, no, wait. Because 4 and 2 are in cycles. So the LCM of 4 and 2 is 4? Because 4 is a multiple of 2. So yes, it's 4.
Wait wait, no, wait. Wait, 4 and 2 have an LCM of 4 because 4 is a multiple of 2. So yes, the LCM is 4.
4. 4+1+1: LCM(4,1,1)=4
5. 3+3: LCM(3,3)=3
6. 3+2+1: So cycles of length 3, 2, and 1. LCM(3,2,1)=6
7. 3+1+1+1: LCM(3,1,1,1)=3
8. 2+2+2: LCM(2,2,2)=2
9. 2+2+1+1: LCM(2,2,1,1)=2
10. 2+1+1+1+1: LCM(2,1,1,1,1)=2
11. All 1's: LCM is 1.

Wait, so looking through these, the maximum LCM I see is 6 from the 3+2+1 case. Oh wait, but wait! Did I miss any partitions? Let me double-check. Because I'm pretty sure that for n=6, the maximum order might be higher than 6.

Wait, what about a 3-cycle and a 2-cycle plus a fixed point? So 3+2+1, yeah, that's the same as before. Or is there a partition with higher LCM? Let's think again.

Another approach: the maximum order occurs when the permutation is a single cycle of maximum possible length. But wait, wait, no, because the single cycle gives an order equal to the cycle length, but sometimes a product of smaller cycles can have a higher LCM.

Wait, for example, in S_5, the maximum order is 6? Or is it higher? No, wait, S_5's maximum is 12, I think, from a 3-cycle and a 2-cycle (LCM 6) or maybe 5 (single cycle). Wait no, 3+2 gives LCM 6, which is higher than 5. So for S_5, maximum is 6.

Wait, but for S_6, maybe there's a partition that gives a higher LCM than 6.

Wait, let's see. What if we have a 4-cycle and a 2-cycle? So 4+2: LCM(4,2)=4. That's less than 6.

What about a 5-cycle and a 1-cycle? LCM(5,1)=5, which is less than 6.

What about a 3-cycle and a 2-cycle and a 1-cycle: LCM 6.

Wait, what about a 3-cycle and a 3-cycle: 3+3, LCM is 3. Not better.

Wait, another partition: 2+2+2, but LCM is 2. No.

Wait, wait, I'm missing something. What about a 2-cycle and a 4-cycle? Wait, that's the same as 4+2, which gives LCM 4.

Alternatively, a 5-cycle and a 1-cycle as I thought before.

Wait, perhaps I'm wrong. Maybe in S_6, the maximum order is 6, but I'm not sure. I think I might be missing a partition that gives a higher LCM. Oh wait, wait a second, another partition: 3 + 2 + 1, which gives LCM 6.

Wait, but I remember that for S_6, the maximum order is 6, but I'm not entirely confident. Or is it higher? Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the maximum comes from a 3-cycle and a 2-cycle plus a fixed point, which is what I thought, giving LCM 6.

Wait, but wait another thought: the partition 2+3+1 is same as 3+2+1, so same LCM.

Wait, perhaps I'm forgetting a partition where the LCM is higher. Let me think: 5+1 gives 5, 4+2 gives 4, 3+3 gives 3, 3+2+1 gives 6.

Wait, another approach: maybe a 6-cycle, which gives order 6. So same as 3+2+1.

Wait, but I'm starting to think that 6 is the maximum. But in that case, the options given are A:30, B:48, up to J:72. Wait, none of the options I've considered (like 6) are in the options. So I must be making a mistake.

Wait, the options are A:30, B:48, C:24, D:6, E:60, F:36, G:12, H:105, I:18, J:72.

Wait, I thought the maximum order was 6, but that's option D. But that seems too low because I remember that in S_6, the maximum is higher.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating the partitions. Let me try to list all possible cycle structures and their LCMs again.

Wait, another possible partition is 3 + 2 + 1. So LCM is 6.

Wait, but wait, another possibility: what about a 4-cycle and a 2-cycle. That's 4+2, but LCM(4,2)=4.

Wait, what about a 3-cycle and a separate 3-cycle (3+3), LCM is 3.

Wait, so the maximum so far is 6.

But that's not matching the options. Because the options don't have 6 as the maximum. Oh wait, no, option D is 6, but perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a partition. Let me think of all possible integer partitions of 6.

Wait, 6 can be split as:

- 6
- 5 +1
- 4 +2
- 4 +1 +1
- 3 +3
- 3 +2 +1
- 3 +1 +1 +1
- 2 +2 +2
- 2 +2 +1 +1
- 2 +1 +1 +1 +1
- 1+1+1+1+1+1

But wait, is that all? Or am I missing some other possible partitions.

Wait, another possible partition is 2 + 3 +1, but that's same as 3+2+1.

Alternatively, is there a 2+2+2, which gives LCM 2.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a partition like 3 + 2 +1, which gives 6, but that's already considered.

Wait, but wait, maybe the maximum comes from a 5-cycle and a 1-cycle, giving LCM 5.

Wait, perhaps I'm forgetting a partition that gives a higher LCM, like 3+2+1 gives 6.

Wait, but maybe in S_6, the maximum is higher than 6.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try a different approach. I think the maximum order in S_n is given by Landau's function, which gives the maximum order of an element in S_n. I remember that for n=6, Landau's function gives 6 as the maximum order. But wait, that can't be right because I'm pretty sure that in S_6, you can get higher than 6.

Wait, no, wait, perhaps I'm thinking of another value. Let me see, Landau's function for n=1 is 1, n=2 is 2, n=3 is 3, n=4 is 4, n=5 is 6, n=6 is 6. No, that can't be right. Wait, wait, I think I'm mixing up something.

Wait, perhaps I should look up Landau's function values for small n. But since I can't do that right now, I have to think logically.

Wait, maybe in S_6, the maximum order is 6, but I'm not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I should consider the possible cycle types and their LCMs.

Let me list each possible cycle type for S_6 and compute the LCM.

1. (6): LCM=6.
2. (5,1): LCM=5.
3. (4,2): LCM=4.
4. (4,1,1): LCM=4.
5. (3,3): LCM=3.
6. (3,2,1): LCM=6.
7. (3,1^3): LCM=3.
8. (2^3): LCM=2.
9. (2^2,1^2): LCM=2.
10. (2,1^4): LCM=2.
11. (1^6): LCM=1.

So in all these cases, the maximum LCM is 6. So the maximum order in S_6 is 6.

Wait, but that's answer D:6. But the options include higher numbers like 12, 18, 24, etc. So maybe I'm making a mistake.

Wait, am I forgetting a possible cycle structure that gives a higher LCM?

Wait, another thought: suppose we have a 3-cycle and a 2-cycle, and a 1-cycle. That gives LCM(3,2)=6. But what if we have a 4-cycle and a 2-cycle? That's LCM(4,2)=4. Or a 5-cycle and a 1-cycle: LCM 5.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing an important cycle structure. Oh wait! What about a 3-cycle, a 2-cycle, and another 2-cycle? So the cycle type is (3,2,2,1). Wait, no, because the sum would be 3+2+2+1=8, which is more than 6. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, perhaps a 3-cycle and a 3-cycle, but that gives LCM 3.

Wait, perhaps the maximum is indeed 6. So the answer would be D:6.

But wait, I'm confused because I thought the maximum was higher. Maybe I'm recalling wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I'm correct, and the answer is D:6.

Wait, but looking back at the problem, the options include C:24, which is higher than 6. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the permutation's structure differently. Wait, no, the order is determined by the LCM of the cycle lengths.

Wait, perhaps I'm considering only the cycle type, but maybe I should think about the actual permutation. Wait, in S_6, the highest possible order is 6, from a 6-cycle.

Wait, but let me check another possibility. Suppose we have a 4-cycle and a 2-cycle. Their LCM is 4, which is less than 6. So that's not better.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a 3-cycle and a 2-cycle combined with something else. Wait, no, in S_6, 3+2+1 is 6 elements, so the LCM is 6. So that's the maximum.

So then the maximum order is 6, which is option D.

Wait, but let me think again. I'm a bit shaky on this because I thought the maximum in S_6 was higher. Alternatively, perhaps I'm correct, and the answer is D:6.

But wait, wait another thought: in S_4, the maximum order is 4 (from a 4-cycle), but sometimes a 3-cycle and a transposition give LCM 6, which is higher than 4. So in S_4, the maximum is 4, but in S_5, with a 3-cycle and a 2-cycle, the LCM is 6, which is higher than a 5-cycle's 5.

Wait, no, in S_5, the maximum is indeed 6, from the product of a 3-cycle and a 2-cycle.

So for S_6, perhaps the maximum is 6, but wait, what if we have a 4-cycle and a 2-cycle? Their LCM is 4, which is less than 6.

Alternatively, a 5-cycle and a 1-cycle: LCM 5, which is less than 6.

Wait, so the maximum in S_6 would be 6, from either a 6-cycle or a 3-cycle plus a 2-cycle plus a fixed point.

Thus, the answer should be D:6.

But the options include higher numbers like 12, 24, etc. So maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, wait! Oh wait a minute! I think I'm confusing the order of an element with the order of the group. The order of the group S_n is n!, which is 720 for n=6. But that's not relevant here.

Wait, perhaps I've made a mistake in considering the possible cycle types. Let me think again: is there a way to get a higher LCM than 6 in S_6?

Wait, for example, a 3-cycle and a 4-cycle would require 3+4=7 elements, which is more than 6, so that's impossible in S_6.

Alternatively, a 2-cycle and a 3-cycle and a 1-cycle gives LCM 6.

Wait, another thought: what about a 2-cycle and two 2-cycles? So (2,2,2), but that's 2+2+2=6. The LCM is 2. So that's worse than 6.

So, I'm starting to think that 6 is indeed the maximum possible order for an element in S_6.

But then the options include D:6. So perhaps that's the correct answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit uncertain because I thought the maximum was higher. Let me try to think if there's any other cycle structure I'm missing.

Wait, another possibility: a 3-cycle and a 2-cycle and a 1-cycle gives LCM 6. So that's the same as a 6-cycle.

Wait, perhaps I'm correct, and the answer is 6, which is option D.

To determine the maximum possible order for an element of \( S_6 \), we need to consider the cycle structures of permutations in the symmetric group \( S_6 \). The order of a permutation is given by the least common multiple (LCM) of the lengths of its cycles. The goal is to find the cycle structure that maximizes this LCM.

### Possible Cycle Structures in \( S_6 \)
The integer partitions of 6 correspond to the possible cycle structures of permutations in \( S_6 \). These partitions are:

1. \( 6 \)
2. \( 5 + 1 \)
3. \( 4 + 2 \)
4. \( 4 + 1 + 1 \)
5. \( 3 + 3 \)
6. \( 3 + 2 + 1 \)
7. \( 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 \)
8. \( 2 + 2 + 2 \)
9. \( 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 \)
10. \( 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 \)
11. \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 \)

### Calculating the LCM for Each Cycle Structure
For each partition, the order of the permutation is the LCM of the cycle lengths:

1. \( 6 \): \( \text{LCM}(6) = 6 \)
2. \( 5 + 1 \): \( \text{LCM}(5, 1) = 5 \)
3. \( 4 + 2 \): \( \text{LCM}(4, 2) = 4 \)
4. \( 4 + 1 + 1 \): \( \text{LCM}(4, 1, 1) = 4 \)
5. \( 3 + 3 \): \( \text{LCM}(3, 3) = 3 \)
6. \( 3 + 2 + 1 \): \( \text{LCM}(3, 2, 1) = 6 \)
7. \( 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 \): \( \
