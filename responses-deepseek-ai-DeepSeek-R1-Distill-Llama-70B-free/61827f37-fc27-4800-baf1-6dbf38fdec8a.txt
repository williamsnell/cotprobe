Okay, so I've got this physics problem about calculating the work done by a variable force. Hmm, I remember that work is related to the integral of force over distance. Let me think about what I learned in class.

The problem says the force is 5x⁻² pounds, and the object moves from x=1 foot to x=10 feet. So I need to find the work done when the object is moved from 1 to 10 ft. Right, work is the integral of force dx, so I should integrate F(x) from x=1 to x=10.

Wait, F(x) is 5/x², so the integral of that with respect to x. Oh wait, the integral of 5x⁻² dx. Let me recall the integral rules. The integral of x^n is (x^(n+1))/(n+1), right? So for n = -2, it becomes (x^(-1))/(-1), which is -1/x.

So the integral of 5x⁻² dx is 5*( -1/x ) + C. So evaluating from 1 to 10, it's [5*(-1/10)] - [5*(-1/1)]. Let's compute that.

First, at x=10: 5*(-1/10) = -0.5. At x=1: 5*(-1/1) = -5. So subtracting, it's (-0.5) - (-5) = (-0.5 +5) = 4.5. Oh wait, so the work done is 4.5 ft-lb.

Wait, but wait a minute. I might have messed up the signs. Since work is the integral from 1 to 10, let me write it as 5∫ from 1 to10 of x⁻² dx. So the integral is [-5/x] from 1 to10.

So plugging in 10 gives -5/10 = -0.5. Plugging in 1 gives -5/1 = -5. So the integral is (-0.5) - (-5) = 4.5. That makes sense. So the work done is positive 4.5 foot-pounds.

Looking at the options, option I is 4.5 ft-lb. So the answer should be I.

To calculate the work done by a variable force \( F(x) = 5x^{-2} \) pounds as the object moves from \( x = 1 \, \text{ft} \) to \( x = 10 \, \text{ft} \), we use the formula for work:

\[
W = \int_{x_1}^{x_2} F(x) \, dx
\]

Substituting \( F(x) = 5x^{-2} \), the integral becomes:

\[
W = \int_{1}^{10} 5x^{-2} \, dx
\]

The integral of \( x^{-2} \) is \( -x^{-1} \), so:

\[
W = 5 \int_{1}^{10} x^{-2} \, dx = 5 \left[ -\frac{1}{x} \right]_{1}^{10}
\]

Evaluating this at the bounds:

\[
W = 5 \left[ -\frac{1}{10} - \left( -\frac{1}{1} \right) \right] = 5 \left[ -\frac{1}{10} + 1 \right] = 5 \left[ \frac{9}{10} \right] = 4.5 \, \text{ft-lb}
\]

Thus, the work done is \( 4.5 \, \text{ft-lb} \), which corresponds to option I.
