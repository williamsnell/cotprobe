Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"I observe the great and wonderful mistake, both our own and our fathers, as to the civil powers of this world, acting in spiritual matters. I have read…the last will and testament of the Lord Jesus over many times, and yet I cannot find by one tittle of that testament that if He had been pleased to have accepted of a temporal crown and government that ever He would have put forth the least finger of temporal or civil power in the matters of His spiritual affairs and Kingdom. Hence must it lamentably be against the testimony of Christ Jesus for the civil state to impose upon the souls of the people a religion, a worship, a ministry, oaths (in religious and civil affairs), tithes, times, days, marryings, and buryings in holy ground…"

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about the Puritans and their beliefs on religious freedom. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is referring to a quote by Roger Williams from 1652, "The Hireling Ministry None of Christ's." In the quote, Williams talks about the mistake of civil powers involving themselves in spiritual matters. He argues that Christ's testament doesn't support the use of civil power to impose religion, worship, ministry, etc., on people. So, he's against the government forcing religious practices on individuals.

Now, the question is asking what the Puritans believed regarding the freedom to practice religion. The options are A through J, each suggesting different groups that should be included.

Wait, but I remember that the Puritans were a specific group within the broader Protestant movement. They were quite strict in their religious views. So, I'm trying to recall: did they believe in religious freedom for everyone or just for themselves?

I think the Puritans, especially in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, didn't really support freedom of religion for all. They had a theocratic government where the church and state were closely tied. They believed their form of Christianity was the correct one, and others might not have the same freedoms.

But wait, Roger Williams was a Puritan, right? Or was he more of a separatist? Oh, right, he was a Puritan who ended up advocating for the separation of church and state. He founded Rhode Island, which allowed more religious freedom. But the question is about the general Puritan belief, not Williams' specific views.

So, if the question is about the Puritans in general, I think they didn't extend religious freedom to all. They were more about enforcing their own religious practices. So, looking at the options, the answer might be that they only believed in freedom for themselves, the Puritans.

Wait, but let me think again. I remember that the Puritans came to America seeking religious freedom for themselves, but they weren't necessarily open to others having the same freedom. They were intolerant of other religious groups, like Quakers or Catholics. So, their belief was more about their own freedom rather than extending it universally.

Looking at the options:

A: All religious groups without exception. That doesn't seem right because the Puritans were restrictive.

B: All Protestants only. Maybe, but I'm not sure if they included all Protestants or just their own sect.

C: All monotheistic religions only. Not sure, but I think they were more focused on Christianity.

D: Puritans only. This seems plausible because they were strict about their own beliefs.

E: Only those who pay tithes and swear oaths. Not sure, but Williams was against such impositions, but the question is about the Puritans, not Williams.

F: No one, religion should be banned. No, they were religious themselves.

G: All Jews and Christians only. Maybe, but I'm not certain.

H: Atheists and agnostics only. Definitely not.

I: All Christians only. Possibly, but I think it was even more restrictive.

J: All Abrahamic religions only. That includes Jews, Christians, Muslims, but I'm not sure about Muslims being included.

Wait, in the 17th century, the Puritans were in a Protestant Christian context. They probably didn't accept Catholics, but what about other Protestants? I think they were quite strict, maybe only their own Puritan sect.

So, the answer might be D: Puritans only. But let me think again. Alternatively, maybe they allowed all Protestants, which would be option B.

Hmm. I've read that in Massachusetts, they allowed only Puritans to vote and hold office, and other religious groups faced persecution. So, it's more likely that they only supported their own group, making D the correct answer.

But wait, another thought: Some sources say that while the Puritans didn't extend full religious freedom to others, they did allow some Protestant dissent as long as it didn't threaten their order. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, Roger Williams' views were more radical than the mainstream Puritans, who were more restrictive.

So, putting it all together, the Puritans believed that freedom to practice religion should be extended to themselves only, the Puritans. So the answer is D.

The Puritans were a religious group known for their strict adherence to their specific Christian beliefs and practices. They established a theocratic society in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, where the church and state were closely intertwined. While they sought religious freedom for themselves, they did not extend this freedom to other groups. Instead, they enforced their own religious practices and were intolerant of other religious sects, such as Quakers, Catholics, and even other Protestants who did not align with their views. This restrictive approach indicates that the Puritans primarily believed in religious freedom for themselves alone.

Given the options, the correct answer is:

D: Puritans only

Answer: D
