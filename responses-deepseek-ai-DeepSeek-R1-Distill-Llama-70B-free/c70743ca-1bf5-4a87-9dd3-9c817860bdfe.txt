Question:

For small, slowly falling objects, the assumption made in the text that the drag force is proportional to the velocity is a good one. For larger, more rapidly falling objects, it is more accurate to assume that the drag force is proportional to the square of the velocity.  If m = 10 kg, find the drag coefficient so that the limiting velocity is 49 m/s.

Options:

A: $\frac{8}{49}$
B: $\frac{6}{49}$
C: $\frac{1}{7}$
D: $\frac{2}{49}$
E: $\frac{5}{49}$
F: $\frac{7}{49}$
G: $\frac{1}{49}$
H: $\frac{1}{98}$
I: $\frac{3}{49}$
J: $\frac{4}{49}$

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read it again. The question is about finding the drag coefficient for a falling object so that its limiting velocity is 49 m/s. The mass is given as 10 kg. 

Hmm, I remember that when an object falls under gravity, there are two forces acting on it: gravity pulling it down and drag force (air resistance) opposing the motion. The limiting velocity, also called the terminal velocity, is when these two forces balance each other out, so the acceleration becomes zero.

Wait, the problem mentions that for larger and faster objects, the drag force is proportional to the square of the velocity. Oh right, that's different from the initial assumption where drag was linear with velocity. So the formula for drag force here is F_drag = c * v², where c is the drag coefficient.

So at terminal velocity, the forces balance. The gravitational force is F_gravity = m * g, where m is mass and g is the acceleration due to gravity. So setting them equal: m * g = c * v_t². 

I need to solve for c, the drag coefficient. Let's rearrange the equation. c = (m * g) / (v_t²). 

Wait, what's the value of g? I think it's approximately 9.8 m/s². But let's double-check that. Yeah, standard gravity is 9.8 m/s². 

Given that m is 10 kg and v_t is 49 m/s. Plugging the numbers in: c = (10 kg * 9.8 m/s²) / (49 m/s)^2. 

Calculating the numerator first: 10 * 9.8 is 98. 

Denominator: 49 squared. Let's see, 49 *49. Hmm, 49 times 50 is 2450, minus 49 gives 2401. So denominator is 2401. 

So c = 98 / 2401. Let me simplify that. Both numerator and denominator can be divided by 49. Wait, 98 divided by 49 is 2. 2401 divided by 49 is 49. Because 49 times 49 is 2401. So 98/2401 simplifies to 2/49. 

Looking back at the options, option D is 2/49. So the answer should be D. 

Wait, did I do everything right? Let me double-check the setup. F_gravity equals F_drag at terminal velocity. Yes, mg = c v². So c = mg/(v²). Yes. The calculation steps seem correct. So yeah, the drag coefficient is 2/49.

To determine the drag coefficient \( c \) for a falling object with a limiting velocity of 49 m/s and a mass of 10 kg, we start by equating the gravitational force and the drag force at terminal velocity. The gravitational force is given by \( F_{\text{gravity}} = m \cdot g \), where \( m = 10 \, \text{kg} \) and \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \). The drag force is proportional to the square of the velocity, \( F_{\text{drag}} = c \cdot v_t^2 \), where \( v_t = 49 \, \text{m/s} \).

At terminal velocity, these forces balance:  
\[
m \cdot g = c \cdot v_t^2
\]

Rearranging for \( c \):  
\[
c = \frac{m \cdot g}{v_t^2}
\]

Substituting the given values:  
\[
c = \frac{10 \cdot 9.8}{49^2}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:  
\[
10 \cdot 9.8 = 98
\]

Next, calculate the denominator:  
\[
49^2 = 2401
\]

Thus:  
\[
c = \frac{98}{2401}
\]

Simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 49:  
\[
c = \frac{2}{49}
\]

From the given options, the correct answer is **D: \( \frac{2}{49} \)**.
