Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about regression models, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by breaking down what the question is asking.

The question is about a regression model that predicts the frequency of tantrums. The predictors are three things: effectiveness of parental commands, consistency of parental discipline, and parental warmth. So, the model is using these three variables to predict the outcome, which is the frequency of tantrums.

I remember that in regression models, each predictor variable gets its own coefficient. The general form is something like Y = β0 + β1X1 + β2X2 + ... + βnXn, where β0 is the y-intercept, and each β represents the coefficients for each predictor. So if there are three predictors, I'd expect three coefficients, right?

Wait, but what about the y-intercept? I think in simple linear regression (with one predictor), you have one slope (coefficient) and one intercept. In multiple regression, each additional predictor adds another coefficient but still only one intercept. So the intercept is just the expected value of Y when all the predictors are zero. So regardless of how many predictors you have, there's only one y-intercept.

So in this case, with three predictors, we should have three regression coefficients and one y-intercept. Now I need to look at the options to see which one matches that.

Looking at the options:

Option E: One y-intercept and three regression coefficients. That seems right.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not confusing anything. Each predictor adds a coefficient, and the intercept is just one. So three predictors mean three coefficients plus one intercept. So the model would have four terms: intercept plus three coefficients times their variables.

So the correct option should have one intercept and three coefficients. Let me check the options again.

Option E is exactly that: one y-intercept and three coefficients. So the answer should be E.

The question involves a regression model predicting the frequency of tantrums based on three predictors: effectiveness of parental commands, consistency of parental discipline, and parental warmth. In a regression model, each predictor variable is associated with its own regression coefficient, and there is a single y-intercept. Therefore, with three predictors, the model will have three regression coefficients and one y-intercept. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option E**: One y-intercept and three regression coefficients. This matches the structure of the model described in the question. 

Thus, the correct answer is:

E
