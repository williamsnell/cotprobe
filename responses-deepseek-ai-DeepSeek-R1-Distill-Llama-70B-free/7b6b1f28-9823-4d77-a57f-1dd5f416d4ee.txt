Question:

A plaintiff sued a defendant for injuries that the plaintiff suffered when he was struck by the defendant's car. At trial, the plaintiff testified that he was walking across the street inside a crosswalk at the time the defendant's car hit him. This action takes place in a jurisdiction that has a statute in effect requiring all motorists to stop and permit pedestrians to cross streets at designated crosswalks. The defendant contended that the plaintiff ran into the street outside the crosswalk. Furthermore, the defendant testified that he immediately applied his brakes when he saw the plaintiff dart into the street, but couldn't stop his car in time to avoid hitting him. In support of the defendant's testimony, the defendant calls a neighbor to testify that she has observed the plaintiff frequently during the years that she has lived on that street, and that the plaintiff "always crosses the street outside the crosswalk. "The neighbor's testimony is likely to be

Options:

A: admitted, because it tends to show that the plaintiff was careless.
B: excluded, because it is based on the neighbor's personal opinion.
C: admitted, because it supports the defendant's version of events.
D: excluded, because her testimony is impermissible evidence of character to show defendant's plaintiff's conduct on a particular occasion.
E: admitted, because it challenges the plaintiff's credibility.
F: excluded, because the neighbor's testimony is hearsay.
G: admitted, because it is probative of the plaintiff's habit of crossing the street outside the crosswalk.
H: excluded, because it is irrelevant to the specific incident.
I: admitted, because it provides context to the plaintiff's behavior.

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this evidence question, and I want to make sure I understand it correctly. Let's break it down.

The situation is a trial where the plaintiff is suing the defendant for injuries caused when the defendant's car hit him. The plaintiff says he was walking inside a crosswalk, which is where pedestrians are supposed to cross. The jurisdiction has a statute requiring motorists to stop for pedestrians in crosswalks. So, if the plaintiff was in the crosswalk, the defendant might be liable for not stopping.

But the defendant is saying that the plaintiff ran into the street outside the crosswalk. So, the defendant's defense is that the plaintiff wasn't following the law, which could mean the defendant isn't entirely at fault or maybe not liable at all. The defendant also testified that he tried to brake but couldn't stop in time.

Now, the defendant calls a neighbor to testify. The neighbor says she's observed the plaintiff over the years and that he "always crosses the street outside the crosswalk." So, the question is whether this testimony is admissible.

I remember that evidence law has rules about character evidence and habits. Generally, a person's character isn't admissible to prove they acted in a certain way on a specific occasion. But there's an exception for habit, which is when a person's behavior is so regular and consistent that it's considered a habit.

So, the neighbor's testimony is about the plaintiff's habit of crossing outside the crosswalk. If this is considered habit evidence, it might be admissible. Habit is different from character because it's about specific, repeated behavior rather than general character traits.

Looking at the options, option G says the testimony is admitted because it's probative of the plaintiff's habit. That makes sense because the neighbor is testifying about the plaintiff's regular behavior, not just his character.

Option D says it's excluded as impermissible character evidence. But if it's habit, then D isn't correct because habit is an exception. So G seems better than D.

Other options: A says it's admitted to show carelessness, but that might be more about character. B says it's excluded as opinion, but the neighbor is stating what she's observed, not giving an opinion. C says it's admitted to support the defendant's version, which is true, but the specific reason would be habit. E is about credibility, but challenging credibility usually involves impeachment, like prior convictions, not habits. F says hearsay, but the neighbor is testifying directly about what she saw, so not hearsay. H says irrelevant, but it's relevant to show the plaintiff's tendency to cross outside, which relates to this incident. I says it's context, which is somewhat vague, but G is more precise.

So, the best answer should be G.
</think>

The neighbor's testimony is admissible because it describes the plaintiff's consistent and regular behavior of crossing outside the crosswalk, which qualifies as habit evidence under the rules of evidence. Habit is an exception to the general rule against character evidence and is relevant to show the plaintiff's likely conduct on the specific occasion in question.

G: admitted, because it is probative of the plaintiff's habit of crossing the street outside the crosswalk.

Answer: G
