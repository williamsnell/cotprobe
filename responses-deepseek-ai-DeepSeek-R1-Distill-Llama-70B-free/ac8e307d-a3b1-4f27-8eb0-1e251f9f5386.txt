Okay, so I have this economics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me think through it step by step. The question is about what happens when the price of a product with inelastic demand is raised.

Hmm, I remember that elasticity of demand refers to how responsive the quantity demanded is to a change in price. Inelastic demand means that the quantity demanded doesn't change much when the price changes. So if demand is inelastic, a price increase won't cause a big drop in quantity demanded.

Wait, the formula for elasticity is percentage change in quantity demanded divided by percentage change in price. If the result is less than one, demand is inelastic. Right.

So when a product has inelastic demand, raising the price... I think the quantity demanded might decrease a little, but not by much. But the price increase is significant. So what happens to total revenue, which is price multiplied by quantity sold?

Since price goes up and quantity doesn't drop proportionally, total revenue should increase. Because the percentage increase in price is bigger than the percentage decrease in quantity. For example, if price goes up by 20% and quantity drops by 10%, then revenue increases by 10% (since 1.2 * 0.9 = 1.08). So revenue goes up.

Looking at the options, the question is about the situation after the price is raised. Let's go through the options one by one.

Option A: Consumers demand more. No, higher price usually reduces quantity demanded, unless it's a Veblen good, but inelastic doesn't imply that. So A is probably wrong.

Option B: Price of complementary goods increases. Hmm, complementary goods are used together. Like if the price of a product goes up, and its demand is inelastic, people might buy less of the complementary goods. Wait, no, because if demand is inelastic, they're buying almost the same quantity. So the demand for complementary goods might decrease, but does that affect their price? Not directly unless supply changes. I don't think B is correct.

Option C: Total revenue increases. That aligns with what I was thinking earlier. So C could be the right answer.

Option D: Product no longer in demand. No, even if price rises, as long as some people still buy it, it's in demand. Inelastic just means not responsive, not zero.

Option E: Revenue unchanged. That would be unitary elasticity. If elasticity is 1, revenue stays same. But here it's inelastic, so E isn't right.

Option F: Quantity demanded increases. No, higher price leads to lower quantity, not higher. Unless it's a Giffen good, but that's a special case and not typically considered here.

Option G: Quantity drastically decreases. No, because inelastic means it doesn't decrease much. So G is opposite of what happens.

Option H: Quantity doesn't change. That would be perfectly inelastic, like horizontal demand curve. But in reality, inelastic just means it's not very responsive, so some change occurs. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Revenue decreases. That would happen if demand is elastic. Because then quantity drops a lot, so price increase doesn't offset it. So I is the opposite.

Option J: Substitute goods' prices decrease. I don't see a direct link. Substitute goods are alternatives. If the price of a product rises, substitutes might see increased demand, which could raise their prices, not lower. So J doesn't make sense.

Putting it all together, the correct answer should be C: Total revenue will increase.

The question asks what happens when the price of a product with inelastic demand is raised. Inelastic demand means that the quantity demanded does not change significantly in response to a price change. When the price increases for such a product, the percentage increase in price is greater than the percentage decrease in quantity demanded. As a result, total revenue (price multiplied by quantity) increases.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. A higher price does not lead to increased quantity demanded.  
- **B**: Incorrect. There is no direct link between the price increase of the product and the prices of complementary goods.  
- **C**: Correct. Total revenue increases because the price increase outweighs the small decrease in quantity demanded.  
- **D**: Incorrect. The product will still be in demand, even at the higher price.  
- **E**: Incorrect. Revenue does not remain unchanged; it increases due to inelastic demand.  
- **F**: Incorrect. Quantity demanded does not increase with a higher price.  
- **G**: Incorrect. Quantity demanded does not drastically decrease with inelastic demand.  
- **H**: Incorrect. Quantity demanded does change, just not significantly.  
- **I**: Incorrect. Revenue decreases only if demand is elastic, which is not the case here.  
- **J**: Incorrect. Substitute goods' prices are unlikely to decrease due to the price increase of the original product.

Thus, the correct answer is **C: Total revenue will increase.**
