Question:

If two modern organisms are distantly related in an evolutionary sense, then one should expect that

Options:

A: their rate of mutation should be identical.
B: they should have the exact same DNA structure.
C: they should have identical physical characteristics.
D: they should share the same number of chromosomes.
E: they live in very different habitats.
F: their chromosomes should be very similar.
G: they shared a common ancestor relatively recently.
H: they should share fewer homologous structures than two more closely related organisms.
I: they should share more homologous structures than two more closely related organisms.
J: they both evolve at the same rate.

Okay, so I've got this biology question here about evolutionary relationships between modern organisms. Hmm, let's see. The question is asking what we should expect if two organisms are distantly related. Distantly related in an evolutionary sense means they diverged from a common ancestor a long time ago, right? So their last common ancestor would be way back in their evolutionary history.

Let me think about the options. I'll go through each one and try to eliminate the wrong ones.

Option A: Their rate of mutation should be identical. Wait, mutation rates can vary between species. I don't think being distantly related affects mutation rates directly. So this might not be correct.

Option B: They should have the exact same DNA structure. No, that doesn't make sense. If they're distantly related, their DNA would have had more time to diverge, so more differences. So B is probably wrong.

Option C: Identical physical characteristics? No, distant relatives are likely to have different traits because they've evolved separately for a long time. So C is out.

Option D: Same number of chromosomes. I remember that chromosome number can vary a lot even between closely related species. Like humans have 23 pairs, but other primates might have different numbers. So D is probably incorrect.

Option E: They live in very different habitats. Maybe, but that's more about their ecology than their evolutionary relatedness. While distant relatives might have diverged into different habitats, it's not a must. So E isn't necessarily a correct expectation.

Option F: Their chromosomes should be very similar. No, distant relatives likely have more differences in their chromosomes due to more time since divergence. So F is probably wrong.

Option G: They shared a common ancestor relatively recently. No, if they're distantly related, the common ancestor was further back, not recent. So G is incorrect.

Option H: They should share fewer homologous structures than two more closely related organisms. Wait, homologous structures are those that have a common evolutionary origin, like forelimbs in vertebrates. If two organisms are closely related, they share more homologous structures because they diverged recently. So distant relatives would have fewer. So H sounds correct.

Option I: They share more homologous structures than closely related. That doesn't make sense, because more time apart should mean fewer similarities. So I is wrong.

Option J: Both evolve at the same rate. Evolution rate depends on various factors, not just relatedness. So J is unlikely.

Putting it all together, the correct answer should be H. Because if they're distantly related, they have fewer homologous structures compared to closely related species.

If two modern organisms are distantly related in an evolutionary sense, it means they diverged from a common ancestor a long time ago. Over time, their genetic and physical traits would have had more opportunity to diverge. 

- **Option A**: Mutation rates are not directly tied to evolutionary relatedness, so this is incorrect.  
- **Option B**: Distantly related organisms would have more differences in their DNA, not identical structures.  
- **Option C**: Distant relatives are unlikely to have identical physical characteristics due to separate evolutionary paths.  
- **Option D**: Chromosome numbers can vary significantly even among closely related species, so this is not necessarily true.  
- **Option E**: While distant relatives might inhabit different habitats, this is not a guaranteed expectation.  
- **Option F**: Chromosomes are likely to differ more in distantly related organisms due to longer divergence times.  
- **Option G**: Distantly related organisms shared a common ancestor further back in time, not recently.  
- **Option H**: Distantly related organisms share fewer homologous structures because they have had more time to diverge, making this correct.  
- **Option I**: This is incorrect, as more time since divergence leads to fewer shared homologous structures.  
- **Option J**: Evolution rates are influenced by various factors and are not uniform across species.  

The correct answer is **H**, as distantly related organisms share fewer homologous structures than more closely related organisms.  

Answer: H
