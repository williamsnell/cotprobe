Question:

A widower was the record owner of a lemon grove, a 30-acre parcel of land in a suburb. The widower lived in a farmhouse on the lemon grove and used the property to raise produce. Adjoining the lemon grove directly to the west was a 10-acre farm that was owned in fee simple by a farmer. There was a four-lane highway that adjoined the lemon grove directly to the east. The widower, by way of gift, executed a deed naming his daughter as grantee. The deed granted to the daughter and her heirs an antebellum mansion located near the southern edge of the lemon grove. The antebellum mansion was accessible by a little- used road that ran west to east from the farmlgrove border to the four-lane highway along the southern boundary of the grove. The daughter recorded her deed and took immediate possession of the property. A short while later, the daughter and the farmer fell in love and began seeing each other quite frequently. In order for the farmer to reach the daughter's house, it was necessary for him to travel over the little-used road across the lemon grove. Many years later, the farmer, who was still having an affair with the daughter, met her father at a Rotary Club meeting. They struck up a conversation, and the widower asked the farmer, "Have you been driving your pickup along that little-used back road on my property?" The farmer, who was afraid to tell the widower about his love affair with the daughter, responded with a half-truth, "Yes, I've been using it as a shortcut to the four-lane highway. " Unaware that the farmer was also using the path to get to the antebellum mansion to see the daughter, the widower said, "No problem, I just wanted to be sure that it was you who was using the road. "Thereafter, the widower found out about his daughter's relationship with the farmer. Infuriated, the widower confronted the farmer and told him, "Listen, you lying sneak, if I catch you on my property again, I'm going to have you arrested for trespass. " The farmer replied, "Sorry, Pops, but I've acquired an easement over that roadway, and I'll continue to use it anytime I want. "Then, the widower institutes an appropriate action to enjoin the farmer from using the roadway across the lemon grove. If the widower prevails, it will be because the farmer's use was

Okay, so I've got this property law question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me start by breaking down the scenario.

So, there's a widower who owns a lemon grove, which is 30 acres. He lives there and uses it to raise produce. To the west of his grove is a 10-acre farm owned by a farmer. To the east is a four-lane highway. The widower gives his daughter a deed to an antebellum mansion at the southern edge of the grove. The daughter records the deed and moves in. The mansion is accessible by a little-used road that runs west to east along the southern boundary, connecting the farm to the highway.

Now, the daughter and the farmer start a romantic relationship. The farmer uses this road to get to her house. When the widower asks the farmer about using the road, the farmer says he's using it as a shortcut to the highway. The widower says that's fine. But later, when the widower finds out about their affair, he confronts the farmer, threatening to arrest him if he trespasses again. The farmer claims he has an easement and will keep using the road.

The question is about why the widower would prevail in an action to stop the farmer from using the road. The options relate to the characteristics required for an easement by prescription.

Hmm. So, I remember that to establish an easement by prescription, the use must be open, continuous, without the owner's permission, and for a certain period (which varies by jurisdiction, but the time isn't the issue here). Also, it has to be hostile, meaning against the owner's interests, not permissive.

In this case, the farmer initially used the road secretly to visit the daughter. The widower didn't know about the affair, but when he asked, the farmer lied, saying he used it as a shortcut. The widower allowed that use. So, the farmer's initial use was with the owner's permission, but he was using it for a different purpose (to see the daughter) than what he told the owner.

Wait, but the widower only gave permission for the stated reasonâ€”the shortcut. So, the farmer's actual use (to visit the daughter) was not permitted. So, was the farmer's use permissive or hostile?

Wait, no. Because when the farmer started using the road, he didn't have permission from the widower. He used it without permission to see the daughter. But when the widower found out he was using it and the farmer lied about why, the widower gave permission for the stated reason (the shortcut). So, after that, the farmer had permission for the shortcut but maybe continued to use it for the affair as well.

Wait, but the initial period before the widower gave permission was without permission, so that could be the start of adverse use. But the problem is whether the use was permissive.

Alternatively, maybe the farmer's use was permissive because after the conversation, the widower allowed it. So, the farmer's use after that point was with permission, meaning it can't count towards an easement by prescription because it's not adverse anymore.

Wait, but the initial use (before the conversation) was without permission. But how long did that go on? The question says "many years later," implying that the farmer used it for a long time before the widower found out. But when the widower found out, he gave permission for the stated reason, but not for the actual reason.

Wait, but the key here is that for an easement by prescription, the use must be without the owner's permission for the required time. If the farmer used the road without permission for the required period, then an easement could be established. But if at any point the owner gave permission, that could interrupt the continuity.

In this case, the farmer used the road without permission initially. But then the widower found out, and the farmer said he was using it as a shortcut, and the widower allowed that. So, from that point on, the farmer had permission to use it as a shortcut. But the farmer was also using it to visit the daughter, which the widower didn't know about.

So, does the fact that the farmer had permission for part of the use (the shortcut) mean that the entire use wasn't adverse? Or does the fact that part of the use was without permission (visiting the daughter) affect this?

Wait, maybe the issue is that the farmer's use was permissive. Because after the conversation, the widower allowed the use, so the farmer's continued use was with permission. Therefore, the use wasn't hostile or adverse, which is a requirement for an easement by prescription.

Alternatively, the initial use before the conversation was without permission, so that was hostile. But after the conversation, the use was with permission. So, the farmer might have had some period of adverse use, but perhaps not enough to meet the statutory period required for prescription.

But the question states that the farmer used it for many years before the widower found out, so maybe the time is sufficient. But the key is that the farmer's use was not without the owner's permission for the entire time. Because after the conversation, the use became permissive.

Wait, but the farmer's use for the affair was always without permission. The widower only allowed the use as a shortcut. So, the farmer used the road for two purposes: one permitted (shortcut) and one not (visiting the daughter). But does that mean the use was permissive overall?

Hmm, maybe the use was partially permissive and partially adverse. But for an easement by prescription, the use needs to be without the owner's permission. So, if any part of the use was without permission, does that affect the analysis?

Alternatively, perhaps the farmer's use was permissive because the owner gave permission, even if the farmer used it for another purpose. Because the owner allowed the use in general, the farmer's additional use wouldn't make it adverse.

Wait, but the owner only allowed the use for a specific purpose (the shortcut). The farmer's use for visiting the daughter was not permitted. So, perhaps the farmer's use was a mix of permissive and non-permissive. But would that affect the easement claim?

I think the key is whether the use was permissive. If the owner gave permission for any use, even if the farmer used it for another purpose, the use isn't adverse. Because the permission covers the use, regardless of the reason.

Wait, but the farmer's primary reason for using the road was to see the daughter, which was not permitted. So, perhaps the use was hostile because it was beyond the scope of the owner's permission.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. For an easement by prescription, the use must be without the owner's permission. If the owner gives permission, even if the user uses it for another reason, the use isn't hostile.

So, in this case, after the conversation, the farmer had the owner's permission to use the road as a shortcut. So, any use after that was permissive. Therefore, the farmer can't claim an easement by prescription because the use wasn't without permission for the required time.

Wait, but the farmer used it without permission before the conversation. How long was that? The question says "many years later," implying that the use was for a long time before the conversation. But the time after the conversation would be with permission. So, perhaps the total time without permission wasn't enough, but that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, the use after the conversation was permissive, so the farmer can't claim an easement because the use wasn't continuous without permission.

Wait, but the question is about why the widower would prevail. The options are about the characteristics of the farmer's use.

Looking at the options, option G is "permissive." So, if the use was permissive, then the farmer can't claim an easement by prescription.

But when was the use permissive? Before the conversation, the farmer was using it without permission. After the conversation, the use was with permission for the stated purpose. But the farmer continued to use it for the affair as well. So, part of the use was permissive, part wasn't.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the initial use was permissive because the daughter had ownership of the mansion and perhaps an easement by necessity or something else. Wait, the daughter's deed was for the mansion, but the road was on the widower's property. So, perhaps she had an easement by necessity to access her property. But the question is about the farmer's use, not the daughter's.

Wait, the daughter's ownership of the mansion might have included an easement by necessity for access. So, the farmer, as someone visiting her, would be using that easement. But easements by necessity are appurtenant, so the farmer, as a visitor, might have the right to use it as well.

Wait, but that's perhaps a different issue. The question is about the farmer claiming an easement by prescription. So, the issue is whether his use meets the requirements.

So, going back, the farmer used the road without permission initially. Then, the widower gave permission for a specific use (shortcut). The farmer continued to use it for both the permitted and the non-permitted purpose.

But for prescription, the use must be without the owner's permission. If the owner gave permission, even if the farmer used it for more, the use isn't adverse. So, the farmer's use after the permission was given was permissive, meaning he can't establish an easement by prescription because the required time of adverse use wasn't met.

Alternatively, the use before the permission was without permission, but maybe the time wasn't sufficient. But the question says "many years later," implying that the use was for a long time before the conversation. So, perhaps the use was long enough, but the problem is that it wasn't open or hostile.

Wait, another angle: when the farmer used the road without permission, was that use open and notorious? The farmer was using it to visit the daughter secretly, so maybe the use wasn't open. But the question says he used it frequently, so maybe it was open. But if the use was hidden, perhaps it wasn't open.

But the options don't include "not open and notorious" as the correct answer. Let me review the options again.

Options:

A: not for a necessary purpose.

B: not open and notorious.

C: not hostile.

D: fraudulent.

E: not continuous.

F: not under claim of right.

G: permissive.

H: not for a legal purpose.

I: not exclusive.

J: under implied permission.

So, the possible answers are about the characteristics of the farmer's use.

If the use was permissive (option G), then the farmer can't claim an easement by prescription because permission undermines the adversity required.

But wait, the farmer's initial use was without permission, but after the conversation, it was with permission. So, the use after the conversation was permissive. Therefore, the farmer's use wasn't adverse for the entire time, meaning he can't establish an easement by prescription.

So, the reason the widower would prevail is that the farmer's use was permissive, meaning option G.

Alternatively, maybe the use was initially without permission (hostile), but then became permissive, which would interrupt the continuity. But the question is about why the widower would prevail, so the reason would be that the use wasn't hostile because it was permissive.

Wait, but the initial use was hostile, but then it became permissive. So, the total time of hostile use might not meet the required period. But that's not one of the options.

Alternatively, the farmer's use was under a claim of right, but that's option F. Wait, no, because the farmer had permission, so he wasn't claiming a right.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of the elements again. For easement by prescription, the use must be:

1. Open and notorious (so the owner knows or should know)

2. Continuous and uninterrupted for the statutory period

3. Without the owner's permission (hostile)

4. Actual physical use

So, the issue here is whether the use was without permission. The farmer used the road without permission initially, but then the widower gave permission for a specific use. So, after that, the farmer's use was with permission for the shortcut but without for the affair. But does that make the use permissive overall?

I think that once the owner gives permission, the use is no longer hostile. So, the farmer's use after that point is permissive. Therefore, the farmer can't establish an easement by prescription because the use wasn't without permission for the entire required period.

Therefore, the reason the widower would prevail is that the farmer's use was permissive, so option G.
</think>

To determine why the widower would prevail in an action to enjoin the farmer from using the roadway, we must analyze the farmer's claim of an easement by prescription. For an easement by prescription to exist, the use must meet specific requirements: it must be open, continuous, without the owner's permission (hostile), and for a statutory period. The key issue here is whether the farmer's use was permissive or hostile.

Initially, the farmer used the road without the widower's permission to visit the daughter, which could be considered hostile use. However, when the widower confronted the farmer about using the road, the farmer lied and said he was using it as a shortcut to the highway. The widower then gave permission for this stated purpose. From that point onward, the farmer's use of the road for the shortcut was permissive. Although the farmer continued to use the road to visit the daughter, the widower's permission for the shortcut undermines the hostility of the use. For an easement by prescription, the use must be without the owner's permission for the entire statutory period. Since the farmer's use became permissive after the widower granted permission, the farmer cannot establish an easement by prescription.

Thus, the reason the widower would prevail is that the farmer's use was permissive, which precludes the establishment of an easement by prescription.
