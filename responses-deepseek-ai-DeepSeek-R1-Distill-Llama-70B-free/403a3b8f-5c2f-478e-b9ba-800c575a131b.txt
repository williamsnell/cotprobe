Okay, so I've got this question here asking who discovered the first virus. The options are from A to J, and I need to figure out the correct one. Let me think about what I know regarding the history of virology.

I remember that viruses are pretty small, right? So small that they can't be seen with just any microscope. The early microscopes weren't powerful enough to spot them. Wait, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek was a microscopist who discovered many microorganisms, but I think he saw bacteria and protozoa, not viruses. So option A is probably not the answer.

Then there's Edward Jenner. Oh, right! He's known for developing the smallpox vaccine, which is a virus-based vaccine. But did he actually discover viruses? I don't think so. His work was more about vaccination, not isolating or identifying a virus. So option C might not be correct.

Louis Pasteur comes to mind. He did a lot in microbiology, like pasteurization and germ theory. But again, I'm not sure he worked with viruses specifically. He might have done more with bacteria and other microorganisms. So D is probably not the right choice.

Jonas Salk is famous for the polio vaccine. But that's in the 20th century, and the question is about the first virus discovery, which I think was earlier. So B is out.

Robert Hooke discovered cells using a microscope, but that's more about plant cells and cork tissue. Not viruses. So F isn't it either.

Gregor Mendel is the father of genetics with his pea plant experiments, so G is unrelated.

James Watson is known for DNA structure, along with Crick. So H is not relevant here.

Albert Einstein is a physicist, not a biologist, so J is definitely out.

Now, the options left are I and E. Charles Chamberland was a French microbiologist. I think he invented the Chamberland filter, which is used to filter out bacteria, leaving viruses behind. But did he discover the first virus? Or was it someone else?

Wait, Dmitri Ivanovsky. Oh right! I remember he was a Russian scientist who, around 1892, discovered the tobacco mosaic virus. He did experiments showing that sap from infected tobacco plants could cause disease even after passing through a filter that trapped bacteria. So he's considered one of the first to identify a virus. That would make option I the correct answer.

So putting it all together, the first virus was discovered by Dmitri Iwanowsky, which is option I.

The first virus was discovered by Dmitri Iwanowsky, a botanist who demonstrated that the tobacco mosaic virus could cause disease even after being filtered to remove bacteria. This discovery marked a significant milestone in virology.

Answer: I
