Okay, I have this multiple-choice question about organizational culture, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's start by understanding the question.

The question is asking which type of culture is characterized by workers' acceptance of change. So, I need to recall different types of organizational cultures and their characteristics.

I remember that organizational cultures can be categorized in various ways. The common types include:

1. Hierarchical culture: This is where there's a clear structure with layers of management. Decision-making is top-down, and employees follow established procedures. I'm not sure if this is the one because it's more about structure than change acceptance.

2. Power culture: This culture is centered around a central figure or a small group. It's more about power distribution, so maybe not directly related to change acceptance.

3. Task culture: This is focused on getting the job done. It's project-oriented, and teams are often formed to achieve specific tasks. People might be more flexible here because tasks can change, but I'm not certain if this is the best fit for change acceptance.

4. Competitive culture: This is where there's a lot of internal competition among employees. It's more about individual performance, which might not directly tie to accepting change.

5. Collaborative culture: This is about teamwork, cooperation, and shared goals. Employees work together, and communication is open. A collaborative environment might foster acceptance of change because everyone is involved and working together towards common objectives.

6. Individualistic culture: This focuses on individual achievements and personal goals. Employees might be more resistant to change if it affects their personal work or goals.

7. Process culture: This is about following established procedures and valuing tradition. This might make employees resistant to change because they prefer sticking to known processes.

Now, thinking about which culture would have workers more accepting of change. Change management is often easier in cultures where employees are engaged, communicated with, and feel part of the process. A collaborative culture encourages participation and teamwork, which can make people more open to change because they feel involved and valued.

Alternatively, a task culture is project-oriented, so employees are used to working on different tasks, which might mean they're adaptable. But task culture is more about efficiency in task completion than about how open they are to change.

Wait, another thought: In a collaborative culture, change is more likely to be accepted because it's communicated and worked on as a team. People are more willing when they feel part of the process.

So, putting it together, the answer might be E: Collaborative culture.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused between E and G. Let me think again. Task culture is about the task at hand. If the task changes, maybe people adapt because they're focused on completing tasks. But does that imply they accept change more readily?

Alternatively, a collaborative culture emphasizes teamwork and shared goals, which might make change easier to implement because everyone is working together towards adapting.

I think the key here is that in a collaborative culture, communication and involvement are high, leading to better acceptance of change.

The question asks which type of culture is characterized by workers' acceptance of change. To determine this, we analyze the characteristics of various organizational cultures:

- **Hierarchical culture**: Focuses on structure and top-down decision-making, not directly related to change acceptance.
- **Power culture**: Centers on power distribution, which doesn't inherently foster change acceptance.
- **Task culture**: Emphasizes project completion and adaptability, but it's more about efficiency than openness to change.
- **Competitive culture**: Driven by internal competition, which may not promote collective acceptance of change.
- **Collaborative culture**: Values teamwork, open communication, and shared goals, making employees more likely to accept change as they feel involved and valued.
- **Individualistic culture**: Focuses on individual achievements, which might lead to resistance if change affects personal goals.
- **Process culture**: Prioritizes established procedures, potentially leading to resistance to change.

A collaborative culture stands out because its emphasis on teamwork and shared goals facilitates better communication and involvement, making workers more accepting of change. While a task culture may involve adaptability, it is more about task efficiency than openness to change. Therefore, the best answer is:

E: Collaborative culture.
