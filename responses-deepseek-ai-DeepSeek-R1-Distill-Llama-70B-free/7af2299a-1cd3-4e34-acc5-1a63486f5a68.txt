Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this logic problem. The question is about identifying the antecedent of a conditional proposition. The statement given is: "The Bees win their first game only if either the Aardvarks or the Chipmunks do not win their first games."

Hmm, I remember that in logic, a conditional statement is usually in the form "If P, then Q." Here, P is the antecedent, and Q is the consequent. But sometimes the wording can be a bit tricky, like using "only if" instead of "if."

So, let me break down the given statement. The phrase is "The Bees win their first game only if..." I think "only if" can be a bit confusing. I've heard that "A only if B" translates to "If A, then B." So in this case, A is "The Bees win their first game," and B is "either the Aardvarks or the Chipmunks do not win their first games."

Wait, so the structure is "A only if B," which is logically equivalent to "If A, then B." That means the antecedent is A, which is "The Bees win their first game." But let me double-check that because sometimes it's easy to get confused with the contrapositive.

In a conditional statement "If P, then Q," the antecedent is P. So in "A only if B," A is P, and B is Q. So the antecedent should be A, which is the part about the Bees winning.

Looking at the options, let's see. The options are labeled A through J. I need to find which option corresponds to "The Bees win their first game."

Option H says "The Bees win their first game." That seems to be the antecedent. So the answer should be option H.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not mixing anything up. Another way to think about it is that the original statement is "Bees win only if (Aardvarks don't win or Chipmunks don't win)." So the structure is "Bees win → (¬Aardvarks ∨ ¬Chipmunks)." So the antecedent is "Bees win," which is option H.

Yeah, I think that's correct. So the antecedent is option H.

The antecedent of the conditional proposition is identified as "The Bees win their first game," which corresponds to option H.

Answer: H
