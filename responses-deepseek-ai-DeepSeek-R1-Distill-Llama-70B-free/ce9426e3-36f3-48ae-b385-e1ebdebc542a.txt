Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about what happens to the kinetic energy when the speed of a moving body doubles its momentum. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, momentum is mass times velocity, right? So p = mv. And kinetic energy is (1/2)mv². Oh, right, so KE depends on the square of the velocity, while momentum is linear in velocity.

The question says that an increase in speed doubles the momentum. So, if the original momentum was p, after the increase it's 2p. Let me denote the initial speed as v, so initial momentum p = mv. After the speed increases, the new momentum is 2p. Let me call the new speed v'. So mv' = 2mv. Oh wait, the mass probably stays the same, right? So v' = 2v. Oh wait, no, wait a second. Because if the speed increases such that momentum doubles, then v' would be 2v only if mass is constant. But wait, wait, maybe the mass isn't changing. Let me clarify.

Wait, the problem doesn't say anything about mass changing, so I'll assume it's constant. So initial momentum p1 = mv. After the increase, p2 = 2p1. So, p2 = mv' = 2mv. So dividing both sides by m, v' = 2v. Oh, so the speed doubles. Wait, but that's not possible because if speed doubles, then momentum would double, and kinetic energy would quadruple. Because KE is proportional to v squared. So wait, that would make the kinetic energy four times as much. So if the speed doubles, KE becomes (v')²/(v²) times the original, which is 4 times. So KE quadruples, which would mean the option E is correct, right?

But wait, wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Wait, the question says when speed increases and the momentum doubles. So, if the speed increases, but not necessarily in a way that's linear. Wait, but p = mv, so if p doubles and m is constant, then v must double as well. So if the speed doubles, then KE becomes (2v)^2 = 4v², so 4 times the original KE. So the KE would quadruple, so option E.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about it differently. Let me consider the initial and final states.

Initial momentum: p = mv.

Kinetic energy: KE_initial = (1/2)mv².

After the speed change, the momentum is 2p = 2mv. So the new velocity v' is 2v (since m is same, 2mv = m v' → v' = 2v).

New kinetic energy: KE_final = (1/2)m (v')² = (1/2)m (2v)^2 = (1/2)m *4v² = 2 mv².

Wait, so KE_initial was (1/2)mv², and KE_final is 2 mv². So KE_final is 4 times KE_initial. Because 2 mv² is 4*(1/2 mv²). So KE becomes four times as much. So the answer should be E: quadruples.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't confuse anything. Let me check with actual numbers. Suppose mass is 1 kg for simplicity. Initial speed is 1 m/s. So initial momentum p = 1*1 = 1 kg·m/s. Kinetic energy is (1/2)*1*(1)^2 = 0.5 J.

Now, speed increases such that momentum doubles. So new momentum is 2 kg·m/s. Since mass is 1 kg, new speed is 2 m/s. New KE is (1/2)*1*(2)^2 = (1/2)*4 = 2 J. So initial KE was 0.5, now it's 2. So it's 4 times higher, which is quadruple. So yes, answer E.

Wait, but another way to look at it: the relationship between momentum and kinetic energy. KE = p²/(2m). Because p = mv → v = p/m. So KE = (1/2)m (p/m)^2 = (1/2) p²/(m). So if momentum doubles, KE becomes (2p)^2/(2m) = 4p²/(2m) = 2 (p²/(2m)) )= 2 KE_initial. Wait, wait, that can't be right because earlier calculation said it quadruples.

Wait, wait, I must have made a mistake here. Let me compute this again. So KE = p²/(2m). So if p doubles, the new p is 2p. So new KE is (2p)^2/(2m) → 4p²/(2m) → 2 (p²/(2m)) ) → 2 * (KE_initial). So wait, that suggests KE doubles, but earlier with numbers it quadrupled. Hmm, now I'm confused.

Wait, wait, I'm messing up the substitution here. Let me try again. If KE_initial is (p^2)/(2m), and then p becomes 2p, so new KE would be ( (2p)^2 ) / (2m) ) = 4p²/(2m) = 2p²/(m). Wait, but the initial KE was p²/(2m). So new KE is 4 times the initial. Because (2p)^2 =4p². So 4p²/(2m) is 2*(2p²/(2m)) )? Wait, no, 4p²/(2m) is 2*(p²/(m)) ), but initial was p²/(2m). So 2*(p²/m) = 4*(p²/(2m)). So yes, the new KE is 4 times the original. So in this case, the KE quadruples.

So why the earlier approach with p=mv gave me 4 times, and the KE = p²/(2m) also gives 4 times. Then why did I think I got 2 times earlier? Oh wait, no, when I put in p=1, then KE becomes 4 times that. So that's correct.

So the answer should be E: quadruples.

When the speed of a moving body increases such that its momentum doubles, the relationship between momentum and kinetic energy must be analyzed. Momentum is defined as \( p = mv \), where \( m \) is mass and \( v \) is velocity. Kinetic energy is given by \( KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 \), which depends on the square of the velocity.

If the momentum doubles, the new momentum is \( 2p \). Assuming the mass remains constant, the velocity must also double (\( v' = 2v \)). Substituting this into the kinetic energy formula, the new kinetic energy becomes:

\[
KE_{\text{final}} = \frac{1}{2}m(v')^2 = \frac{1}{2}m(2v)^2 = \frac{1}{2}m \cdot 4v^2 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = 4 \cdot KE_{\text{initial}}.
\]

Thus, the kinetic energy quadruples when the momentum doubles. This conclusion is consistent with both numerical examples and the derived relationship between momentum and kinetic energy.

The correct answer is:

**E: quadruples**
