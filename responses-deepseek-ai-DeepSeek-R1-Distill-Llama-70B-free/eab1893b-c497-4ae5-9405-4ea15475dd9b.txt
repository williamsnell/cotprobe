Okay, so I've got this question about evidence law, specifically dealing with hearsay exceptions and admissibility. Let me try to break it down. 

The question is about a murder case where the defendant is trying to use an alibi. He's offering testimony that he was committing a bank robbery in another state on the day the victim was killed. The question is about whether this testimony is admissible and under what category.

Hmm, first, I need to recall the rules of evidence, particularly focusing on hearsay and its exceptions. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, which is generally inadmissible unless it falls under an exception.

Wait, but wait—the defendant is testifying themselves, right? So the testimony is from the defendant. When a defendant testifies on their own behalf, their statements are not considered hearsay because they're speaking under oath and subject to cross-examination. So any statements they make while testifying are not hearsay. 

But what about the content of the testimony? He's saying he was committing a bank robbery elsewhere. So he's providing an alibi. Alibi evidence is about establishing that the defendant was somewhere else at the time of the crime, which would mean they couldn't have committed it.

So the options given are various hearsay exceptions and other admissibility factors. Let's look at the options:

Option A: Inadmissible as hearsay. But wait, the testimony is the defendant's own words in court, so it's not hearsay. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B: Admissible as character evidence. Character evidence is generally not admissible in a criminal case unless it's by the defendant and about their own good character. But here, the testimony is about his whereabouts, not his character. So B doesn't fit.

Option C: Declaration against interest. That applies when a person makes a statement that's against their own interest at the time, and the declarant is unavailable. But the defendant is testifying, so they're available. Also, the statement here isn't against their interest because it's an alibi—it actually helps their case. So C is out.

Option D: Admissible as a statement of alibi. Wait, but alibi is a defense, so the testimony about where he was is an alibi. However, I'm not sure if "statement of alibi" is a hearsay exception. Wait, no—the defendant is testifying directly, so it's not a hearsay issue. The alibi is a factual assertion, so it's admissible as substantive evidence. But the option says "statement of alibi"—maybe that's a specific exception? Or perhaps it's more about whether it's hearsay or not.

Option E: Admissible as an admission. An admission is a statement by a party-opponent that's being offered against them. But here, the defendant is making a statement in their own defense, not against. So E doesn't apply.

Option F: Then-existing state of mind. That's an exception for statements showing the declarant's state of mind, like intent or plan. But the defendant's testimony about being elsewhere is about a past act, not his state of mind. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Admissible as not hearsay. Since the defendant is testifying in court, his statements are not hearsay. So G seems correct because the testimony is not hearsay. It's first-hand testimony.

Option H: Admissible as a self-incriminating statement. Wait, the defendant is testifying about committing another crime (bank robbery). That could incriminate him for that other crime. But the admissibility here is about the murder charge. Testimony about another crime might be admissible as substantive evidence if it's relevant, but the question is about hearsay. Since it's his own testimony, it's not hearsay, but the issue might be about whether it's relevant and if the other crime can be admitted. However, the question is about classification under hearsay exceptions, so H might not be the right choice.

Option I: Inadmissible as opinion, not fact. The testimony is about his location, which is a factual matter, so I is incorrect.

Option J: Inadmissible as irrelevant. His alibi is very relevant because it goes to whether he could have committed the crime. So J is incorrect.

So putting it together: The testimony is not hearsay because it's the defendant's own testimony. Therefore, the correct option is G: admissible as not hearsay.

Wait, but looking at the options again: Option D says "admissible as a statement of alibi." Is that a specific hearsay exception? Or is it more about the nature of the evidence?

Wait a minute, alibi is a defense, and the testimony about it is non-hearsay because it's the defendant's own testimony. So the issue isn't about an exception; it's about the testimony being admissible as factual evidence. So G is correct.

Alternatively, could it be D? No, because "statement of alibi" isn't a hearsay exception. The statement here isn't hearsay at all, so G is better.

The question revolves around the admissibility of a defendant's testimony that he was committing a bank robbery in another state at the time of the murder. The key issue is whether this testimony is admissible and under what category. 

Hearsay is generally inadmissible unless it falls under an exception. However, the defendant's own testimony in court is not considered hearsay because it is made under oath and subject to cross-examination. The testimony here is about the defendant's whereabouts, which is an alibi, a factual assertion aimed at establishing that he could not have committed the crime.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The testimony is not hearsay because it is the defendant's own testimony in court.
- **B**: Incorrect. The testimony is not about the defendant's character but about his location.
- **C**: Incorrect. A declaration against interest requires the declarant to be unavailable, which is not the case here.
- **D**: Incorrect. While the testimony is an alibi, "statement of alibi" is not a specific hearsay exception. The testimony is admissible because it is not hearsay.
- **E**: Incorrect. An admission is a statement by a party-opponent, which does not apply here.
- **F**: Incorrect. The testimony is about a past act, not the defendant's state of mind.
- **G**: Correct. The testimony is admissible because it is not hearsay; it is the defendant's own testimony.
- **H**: Incorrect. While the testimony might incriminate the defendant for another crime, the focus is on whether it is hearsay, which it is not.
- **I**: Incorrect. The testimony is a factual statement about the defendant's location, not an opinion.
- **J**: Incorrect. The testimony is highly relevant as it goes to the defendant's ability to commit the crime.

The testimony is admissible because it is not hearsay, making the correct answer **G**.

Answer: G
