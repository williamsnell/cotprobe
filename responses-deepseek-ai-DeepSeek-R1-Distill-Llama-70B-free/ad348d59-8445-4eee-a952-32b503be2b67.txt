Question:

7.3-5. In order to estimate the proportion, $p$, of a large class of college freshmen that had high school GPAs from 3.2 to 3.6 , inclusive, a sample of $n=50$ students was taken. It was found that $y=9$ students fell into this interval.
(a) Give a point estimate of $p$.

Okay, so I've got this statistics problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully to understand what's being asked.

The question is about estimating the proportion, p, of a large class of college freshmen whose high school GPAs fall between 3.2 and 3.6, inclusive. They took a sample of n=50 students, and found that y=9 students were in this interval. The task is to give a point estimate of p.

Hmm, I remember that a point estimate is a single value used to estimate a population parameter. In this case, the parameter is the proportion p. The sample proportion is usually used as the point estimate for the population proportion.

So the formula for the sample proportion is p_hat = y / n, where y is the number of successes in the sample, and n is the sample size.

Let me plug in the numbers. y is 9, and n is 50. So p_hat = 9 / 50. Let me calculate that.

9 divided by 50 equals 0.18. So that's 0.18.

Now looking at the options provided: A is 0.1000, B is 0.1600, C is 0.1200, D is 0.2000, E is 0.2200, F is 0.1400, G is 0.3000, H is 0.2500, I is 0.2800, J is 0.1800.

So 0.18 corresponds to option J. 

Wait, let me double-check my calculation. 9 divided by 50. 50 goes into 9 zero times, put a decimal. 50 into 90 once (1*50=50), remainder 40. Bring down the next zero: 400. 50 goes into 400 eight times (8*50=400), so 0.18 exactly. Yep, that's right.

So the point estimate is 0.18, which is option J.

To estimate the proportion \( p \) of college freshmen with high school GPAs between 3.2 and 3.6, we use the sample proportion \( \hat{p} \) as the point estimate. The formula for the sample proportion is:

\[
\hat{p} = \frac{y}{n}
\]

Here, \( y = 9 \) (the number of students in the desired GPA range) and \( n = 50 \) (the sample size). Substituting these values:

\[
\hat{p} = \frac{9}{50} = 0.18
\]

Among the provided options, \( 0.18 \) corresponds to option J.

Answer: J
