Question:

A national distributor of windows selected a retailer to sell its windows in a specified geographic area. The parties negotiated a written distribution agreement, which stated that any order for windows placed by the retailer would be binding on the distributor "only when expressly accepted by the distributor." For the next two years, the retailer forwarded orders to the distributor, and the distributor always filled the orders. In the third year, the distributor accused the retailer of overcharging customers to install the distributor's windows. The retailer responded that the distributor had no control over the retailer's installation prices. When the distributor received the retailer's next order for windows, it refused to fill the order. If the retailer sues the distributor for breach of contract, will it be likely to prevail?

Options:

A: Yes, because the parties' course of dealing binds the distributor to fill the retailer's order.
B: No, because the agreement gave the distributor the right to expressly accept or reject orders.
C: Yes, because the distributor has always filled the orders in the past, creating an expectation of continued performance.
D: No, because the retailer's practice of overcharging customers excused the distributor's refusal to fill the order.
E: Yes, because the distributor cannot arbitrarily decide not to fill the retailer's orders.
F: Yes, because the distributor's claim regarding overcharging customers is independent of its obligation to fill the retailer's order.
G: No, because the retailer's forwarding of orders to the distributor did not give rise to an obligation on the distributor's part to fill the orders.
H: No, because the distributor has the right to refuse orders at any time according to the agreement.
I: No, because the distributor has the right to reject orders based on the retailer's pricing practices.
J: Yes, because the distributor did not expressly reject the retailer's orders.

Okay, so I have a contract law question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The situation is about a distributor and a retailer who have a written distribution agreement. The key point in the agreement is that any order placed by the retailer is only binding on the distributor when "expressly accepted" by them. So, the distributor has to explicitly agree to each order for it to be binding. 

For two years, the retailer sends orders, and the distributor always fills them. Now, in the third year, the distributor accuses the retailer of overcharging customers for installation. The retailer argues that the distributor has no control over installation prices. Then, when the next order comes in, the distributor refuses to fill it. The retailer sues for breach of contract. 

I need to determine if the retailer will prevail. The options are A through J, each offering a different reasoning.

First, I should think about the terms of the contract. The written agreement says that orders are binding only when expressly accepted. So, under the contract, the distributor isn't obligated to accept every order unless they explicitly agree. 

Now, what's the role of course of dealing or usage of trade here? The UCC (Uniform Commercial Code) comes into play for contracts involving goods, and since windows are goods, UCC Article 2 applies. Under UCC ยง 2-207, additional terms can become part of the contract if certain conditions are met, but that's more about offer and acceptance in the context of a battle of forms. 

But more relevant here might be the concept of firm offers or the implied obligations. However, the contract explicitly states that each order must be accepted. So, unless the contract is modified by subsequent conduct, the distributor's obligation is only upon express acceptance. 

Wait, but the parties have a course of dealing where the distributor always filled the orders for two years. Does that mean that the distributor's acceptance can be implied through their conduct? Or does the written term take precedence? 

In contract interpretation, the written terms usually control unless the course of dealing contradicts them. So, if the written contract says that each order needs express acceptance, then the distributor isn't obligated to fill orders without that acceptance, even if they did so in the past. 

So, when the retailer sends an order, the distributor can choose to accept or not. The fact that they always accepted before doesn't create an obligation unless there's a separate contract modification, which doesn't seem to be the case here. 

Another angle is whether the distributor's refusal to fill the order was for a valid reason. They accused the retailer of overcharging. But the contract doesn't mention anything about pricing by the retailer, so the distributor's reason might be irrelevant. Unless the contract allows termination for cause, but the question is about the obligation to fill the order, not termination of the entire agreement. 

So, the key issue is whether the distributor's refusal to fill the order without express acceptance is a breach. Since the contract requires express acceptance, the distributor isn't in breach by refusing to fill an order they didn't accept. 

Looking at the options:

Option B says no because the agreement gave the right to accept or reject. That seems correct. 

Option A says yes because course of dealing binds the distributor. But the written term should override that. 

Option C says yes because past performance created an expectation. Again, the written term should control. 

Option D says no because overcharging excuses. But the contract doesn't tie this to order acceptance. 

Option G says no because forwarding orders doesn't obligate. That aligns with the written term. 

Option H says no because the distributor can refuse any order according to the agreement. That's correct. 

So, options B, G, H, and I are possibilities. 

Wait, the agreement says "only when expressly accepted." So each order is an offer, and the distributor can accept or reject. So each order is an offer, and without acceptance, there's no contract. So the distributor doesn't have to fill it unless they accept. 

Thus, the correct reasoning is that the distributor has the right to accept or reject each order, as per the contract. So the answer should be either B or H or G. 

Looking at the options:

Option B: No, because the agreement gave the right to accept or reject.

Option H: No, because the agreement says the distributor can refuse at any time.

Option G: No, because forwarding orders don't create an obligation.

Hmm. The precise issue is whether the contract requires express acceptance. So each order is an offer, and the distributor must accept to be bound. So the failure to accept means no obligation. 

Therefore, the correct answer is either B or H. 

Wait, the agreement says "only when expressly accepted." So the distributor can choose to accept or not. So when the retailer sends an order, it's an offer. The distributor can accept it, which creates a binding contract, or not. So if they don't accept, they're not obligated to fill it. 

So when the distributor refused the order, they were within their rights under the contract. So the retailer can't sue successfully for breach because the contract allows the distributor to refuse. 

So the answer would be either B or H. Let me read them again.

Option B: No, because the agreement gave the distributor the right to expressly accept or reject orders.

Option H: No, because the agreement allows the distributor to refuse at any time.

Both seem correct, but perhaps B is more precise because it's about the express right to accept or reject. 

Wait, but the agreement doesn't specify that it can be rejected for any reason. It just says "expressly accepted." So even if the reason is arbitrary, the distributor can refuse. 

But in this case, the distributor's reason was the overcharging, which isn't covered in the contract. So their reason doesn't matter; they just have the right to refuse any order. 

So the correct answer is either B or H, but perhaps more accurately B because it directly addresses the express acceptance. 

Wait, another thought: does the course of dealing over two years where the distributor always accepted create an implied modification of the contract? Under UCC ยง 2-209, a contract can be modified by course of dealing. But the original contract requires express acceptance. So if the course of dealing shows that the distributor always accepted, perhaps it modifies the requirement, so that acceptance can be inferred. 

But UCC ยง 2-209(4) says that a signed agreement's terms can't be contradicted by course of dealing. So if the written contract says "expressly accepted," the course of dealing can't override that. So the distributor still has the right to accept or reject. 

Therefore, the initial analysis holds. The correct answer is B or H.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option B: No, because the agreement gave the right to accept or reject.

Option H: No, because the agreement says the distributor can refuse at any time.

Option G: No, because forwarding orders didn't create an obligation.

So, the contract says each order is only binding upon express acceptance. So each order is an offer that the distributor can accept or reject. If they don't accept, they're not obligated. 

Therefore, the correct answer is B: No, because the agreement gave the distributor the right to expressly accept or reject orders.

Wait, but another thought: under UCC ยง 2-206(1)(b), an order can be accepted either by a written acceptance or by prompt shipment. So if the distributor, upon receiving the order, ships the goods, that's acceptance. Here, the distributor filled the orders for two years, which could be seen as accepting by conduct. But in the third year, they refused to fill an order. 

Wait, but in the scenario, the distributor received the order and refused to fill it. So they didn't accept it. So under the contract, they have the right to do that. 

So the prior dealings don't create an obligation because each order is subject to express acceptance. So each time, the retailer makes an offer, and the distributor can choose to accept or not. 

Therefore, the answer is B.

The question revolves around a written distribution agreement between a distributor and a retailer, which specifies that any order placed by the retailer is binding on the distributor "only when expressly accepted" by the distributor. Under this agreement, the distributor has the explicit right to accept or reject any order. For two years, the distributor consistently filled the retailer's orders, but in the third year, the distributor refused to fill an order, citing the retailer's alleged overcharging of customers. The retailer sued for breach of contract, arguing that the distributor was obligated to fill the order.

Key points of analysis:

1. **Contract Terms**: The written agreement explicitly states that orders are binding on the distributor only when expressly accepted. This means each order from the retailer is an offer, and the distributor must affirmatively accept it to create a binding contract. Without express acceptance, the distributor is not obligated to fill the order.

2. **Course of Dealing**: Although the distributor filled the retailer's orders for two years, this course of dealing does not override the explicit terms of the written agreement. Under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) ยง 2-209(4), a signed agreement's terms cannot be contradicted by course of dealing. Therefore, the distributor's past conduct does not create an obligation to continue filling orders without express acceptance.

3. **Distributor's Right to Refuse**: The agreement grants the distributor the unilateral right to accept or reject any order. The reason for rejection (in this case, alleged overcharging) is irrelevant because the contract does not tie the distributor's acceptance to the retailer's pricing practices. The distributor's refusal to fill the order is within its contractual rights.

4. **Relevant Options**:
   - **Option B**: Correctly states that the distributor has the right to expressly accept or reject orders under the agreement.
   - **Option H**: Also correct, as it emphasizes the distributor's right to refuse orders at any time according to the agreement.
   - Other options (e.g., A, C, D, E, F, G, I, J) are incorrect because they either misinterpret the contract terms, overemphasize the course of dealing, or introduce irrelevant factors.

Given the explicit terms of the agreement, the distributor's refusal to fill the order does not constitute a breach of contract. The correct answer is:

**B: No, because the agreement gave the distributor the right to expressly accept or reject orders.**
