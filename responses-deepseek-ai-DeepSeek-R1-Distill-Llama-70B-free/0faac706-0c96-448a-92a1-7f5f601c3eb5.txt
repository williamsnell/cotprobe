Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me see what the question is asking. Hmm, it's about a charged particle moving in a magnetic field, right? And they're giving me some parameters to find the mass of the particle. Alright, let's break it down.

Alright, the problem says the particle has a charge twice that of an electron. I remember that the charge of an electron is about 1.6 x 10^-19 coulombs. So if the charge is twice that, it would be 2 * 1.6e-19, which is 3.2e-19 coulombs. Got that.

The magnetic field strength is π/4 tesla. Wait, pi is approximately 3.1416, so π/4 is roughly 0.7854 tesla. And the field is perpendicular to the velocity, which I think means the magnetic force is at its maximum because the formula for the magnetic force is qvB sin(theta), and when theta is 90 degrees, sin(theta) is 1. So that's straightforward.

The cyclotron frequency is given as 1600 Hz. I remember that the cyclotron frequency formula is f = (qB)/(2πm). So we're supposed to find the mass m of the particle. Oh right, because the cyclotron frequency depends on the charge, magnetic field, and mass of the particle.

Let me write down the formula:

f = (qB) / (2πm)

We need to solve for m, so rearranging the formula, m = (qB)/(2πf)

Wait, let me double-check that. Oh yes, because f is proportional to (qB/m), so solving for m gives m = (qB)/(2πf). Yeah, that makes sense.

So plugging in the numbers. Let me jot down the values:

q = 3.2e-19 C
B = π/4 T ≈ 0.7854 T
f = 1600 Hz

So m = (3.2e-19 C) * (0.7854 T) / (2 * π * 1600 Hz)

Wait, let me calculate the denominator first. 2 times pi is about 6.2832. Multiply that by 1600 gives 6.2832 * 1600. Let me calculate that: 6 * 1600 is 9600, 0.2832*1600 is around 453.12. So total is 9600 + 453.12 = 10,053.12. Approximately.

So denominator is about 10,053.12.

Now the numerator: 3.2e-19 * 0.7854. Let me compute that. 3.2 * 0.7854 is roughly 2.513. So 2.513e-19.

So m is (2.513e-19) / (10,053.12) kg.

Let me compute that division. 2.513e-19 divided by 1e4 is 2.513e-23. But wait, 10,053 is about 1.0053e4, so 2.513e-19 / 1.0053e4 = (2.513/1.0053) * 1e-23.

2.513 divided by 1.0053 is approximately 2.5. Because 1.0053 is roughly 1, so 2.5/1 is 2.5. So approximately 2.5e-23 kg.

Wait, let me calculate more accurately. Let's do 2.513 / 1.0053.

1.0053 times 2.5 is 2.51325. Oh, that's almost exactly 2.51325. So 2.513 / 1.0053 ≈ 2.5. So m ≈ 2.5e-23 kg.

Looking at the options, option G is 2.5e-23 kg. So that must be the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check all the steps to be sure. Did I make any calculation errors?

Let me recalculate the denominator: 2πf → 2 * π * 1600. π is 3.14159265, so 2 * 3.14159 = 6.28318. Multiply by 1600: 6.28318 * 1600 = 6.28318 * 1.6e3 = let's compute 6 * 1.6e3 = 9600, 0.28318 * 1.6e3 = 453.088. So 9600 + 453.088 = 10,053.088. So denominator is ~10,053.088.

Numerator: qB is 3.2e-19 C * (π/4) T. π/4 is 0.785398. So 3.2e-19 * 0.785398 = let's calculate 3.2 * 0.785398. 3 * 0.785 is 2.355, 0.2 * 0.785 is 0.157, so total 2.512. So 2.512e-19 C·T.

So m = (2.512e-19) / (10,053.088) = approx 2.512e-19 / 1.0053e4 = (2.512 /1.0053) * 1e-23.

Calculating 2.512 / 1.0053: 1.0053 * 2.5 = 2.51325, which is a bit above 2.512, so the actual value is just slightly less than 2.5. Let's see: 1.0053 * 2.499 ≈ 2.499 *1 + 2.499 *0.0053. 2.499 + (approx 0.01324) = 2.51224. That's very close to 2.512. So 2.499 is about 2.512 / 1.0053. So m ≈ 2.499e-23 kg, which is approximately 2.5e-23 kg. So option G.

Wait, but let me look at the options again. Option G is 2.5e-23 kg. Yes, that matches.

To determine the mass of the particle, we use the formula for the cyclotron frequency:

\[
f = \frac{qB}{2\pi m}
\]

Rearranging for \(m\):

\[
m = \frac{qB}{2\pi f}
\]

### Given Values:
- Charge of the particle: \(q = 2 \times 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{C} = 3.2 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{C}\)
- Magnetic field strength: \(B = \frac{\pi}{4} \, \mathrm{T} \approx 0.7854 \, \mathrm{T}\)
- Cyclotron frequency: \(f = 1600 \, \mathrm{Hz}\)

### Calculation:
1. **Denominator**:  
   \[
   2\pi f = 2 \times 3.1416 \times 1600 \approx 10,053.12
   \]

2. **Numerator**:  
   \[
   qB = (3.2 \times 10^{-19}) \times 0.7854 \approx 2.513 \times 10^{-19}
   \]

3. **Mass**:  
   \[
   m = \frac{2.513 \times 10^{-19}}{10,053.12} \approx 2.5 \times 10^{-23} \, \mathrm{kg}
   \]

### Final Answer:
The calculated mass of the particle is approximately \(2.5 \times 10^{-23} \, \mathrm{kg}\), which corresponds to **option G**.
