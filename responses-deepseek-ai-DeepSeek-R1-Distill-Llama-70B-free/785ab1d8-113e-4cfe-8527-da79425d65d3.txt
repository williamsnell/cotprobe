Okay, so I've got this accounting problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about calculating the net profit for the Flamingo Restaurant for the month of October. They've given me a bunch of numbers, and I need to work through them to find the answer.

Let me list out the given data:

- Food on hand as of October 1: $609.31
- Purchases during the month: $1,827.63
- Sales during the month: $4,501.16
- Rent: $175.00
- Salaries: $580.15
- Supplies: $89.47
- Miscellaneous expenses: $50.83
- Food on hand as of October 31: $215.76

And the options are from A to J, each with a different dollar amount. I need to calculate the net profit and pick the correct option.

Hmm, I remember that net profit is calculated by subtracting total expenses from total revenues. But wait, in this context, I think it's more about the restaurant's income and expenses related to food and operations.

Wait, maybe I should approach this step by step. Let's think about the steps involved.

First, I think I need to calculate the cost of goods sold (COGS). COGS for a restaurant would typically include the cost of the food that was used to generate sales. So, the formula for COGS should be the beginning inventory plus purchases minus ending inventory. That makes sense because the inventory they have at the end of the month hasn't been sold yet, so it's not part of the COGS for that period.

So, COGS = Beginning Inventory + Purchases - Ending Inventory.

Plugging in the numbers:

COGS = $609.31 + $1,827.63 - $215.76

Let me calculate that. 609.31 + 1,827.63 is... 609 plus 1827 is 2436, and .31 + .63 is .94, so total is 2,436.94. Then subtract 215.76 from that.

2,436.94 minus 215.76: Let's do the math. 2,436.94 - 200 is 2,236.94. Then subtract 15.76 more: 2,236.94 - 15.76 = 2,221.18. So COGS is $2,221.18.

Wait, but wait a second. That exact number appears in the options. Option B is $2,221.18. But wait, that's just the COGS. I don't think that's the net profit yet.

Oh right, because net profit would be sales minus all expenses, including COGS and other operating expenses.

So, the total revenues are the sales, which is $4,501.16.

Total expenses would be COGS plus rent, salaries, supplies, and miscellaneous expenses.

So let's list all the expenses:

COGS: $2,221.18
Rent: $175.00
Salaries: $580.15
Supplies: $89.47
Miscellaneous: $50.83

Let me sum these up.

First, COGS is 2,221.18.

Adding Rent: 2,221.18 + 175.00 = 2,396.18.

Adding Salaries: 2,396.18 + 580.15. Let's see, 2,396 + 580 is 2,976.18, plus 0.15 makes 2,976.33.

Adding Supplies: 2,976.33 + 89.47. 2,976 + 89 is 3,065, and 0.33 + 0.47 is 0.80. So total is 3,065.80.

Adding Miscellaneous: 3,065.80 + 50.83. 3,065 +50 is 3,115, and 0.80 +0.83 is 1.63, so that's 3,116.63.

So total expenses are $3,116.63.

Now, net profit would be total sales minus total expenses.

Sales are $4,501.16. So 4,501.16 - 3,116.63.

Calculating that: 4,501.16 minus 3,000 is 1,501.16. Then subtract 116.63: 1,501.16 - 116.63.

Let me do it step by step. Subtract 100 from 1,501.16: 1,401.16. Then subtract 16.63: 1,401.16 - 16.63 = 1,384.53.

Wait, so that gives me a net profit of $1,384.53. But looking at the options, option I is exactly that number. So is that the correct answer?

Wait, let me double-check all my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, COGS: 609.31 + 1,827.63 = 2,436.94. Then minus 215.76 gives 2,221.18. That's correct.

Then, total expenses: COGS (2,221.18) + rent (175) = 2,396.18. Plus salaries (580.15): 2,396.18 +580.15 = 2,976.33. Plus supplies (89.47): 2,976.33 +89.47 = 3,065.80. Plus misc (50.83): 3,065.80 +50.83 = 3,116.63. That looks right.

Then, sales are 4,501.16. Subtract total expenses of 3,116.63: 4,501.16 -3,116.63 = 1,384.53. So that's correct.

Looking at the options, I is $1,384.53. So I think that's the answer.

Wait a minute, but let me think again. Did I account for all the expenses correctly? The problem lists rent, salaries, supplies, and miscellaneous expenses. Did I include all of them? Yes, I did. So I think that's correct.

Wait, but wait another thought. Sometimes in some calculations, people might forget to include certain items, but in this case, I think I included all the expenses listed. So I think the net profit is indeed $1,384.53, which is option I.

To calculate the net profit for the Flamingo Restaurant for the month of October, we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):**  
   COGS is determined using the formula:  
   \[
   \text{COGS} = \text{Beginning Inventory} + \text{Purchases} - \text{Ending Inventory}
   \]  
   Substituting the given values:  
   \[
   \text{COGS} = \$609.31 + \$1,827.63 - \$215.76 = \$2,221.18
   \]

2. **Calculate Total Expenses:**  
   Total expenses include COGS and other operating expenses (rent, salaries, supplies, and miscellaneous expenses):  
   \[
   \text{Total Expenses} = \$2,221.18 + \$175.00 + \$580.15 + \$89.47 + \$50.83 = \$3,116.63
   \]

3. **Calculate Net Profit:**  
   Net profit is calculated as total sales minus total expenses:  
   \[
   \text{Net Profit} = \$4,501.16 - \$3,116.63 = \$1,384.53
   \]

After verifying all calculations, the net profit for the Flamingo Restaurant in October is **\$1,384.53**, which corresponds to option **I**.
