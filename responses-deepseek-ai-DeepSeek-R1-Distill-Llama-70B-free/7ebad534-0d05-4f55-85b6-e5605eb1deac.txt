Question:

A 7-year-old student arrived in the United States one year ago from a non-Englishspeaking country, where she achieved high scores in reading. Over the year, she has become fluent in social English. After a few months in a monolingual English second grade, her teacher refers her for evaluation because she has great difficulty with the basal reader used in the class. Two English proficiency tests administered to the student show that she performs above the mean for monolingual English grade peers in speaking and listening but well below the mean in reading and writing. She also performs well above the mean for grade peers on reading tests in her native language. Based on this information alone, which of the following is the most accurate interpretation?

Options:

A:  The discrepancy between the student's native language reading skills and English reading skills is related to the greater complexity of English.
B: The discrepancy between the student's native language reading skills and English reading skills is due to the different teaching methodologies in her previous and current schools.
C: The student's high scores in reading in her native language are misleading her actual reading capacity in English.
D: The student's reading difficulty is due to her inability to adjust to the new learning environment.
E: The student's difficulty in reading is due to lack of exposure to English literature.
F: The student's reading skills are being hindered due to her proficiency in speaking and listening.
G: The discrepancy between the student's English social language skills and reading skills is expected given the richer context in which social skills are acquired.
H: The student's reading difficulty is due to lack of interest in the subject matter in the basal reader.
I: The student's reading difficulty is an early indicator that she will have increased academic problems as her coursework requires more reading.
J: Continued use of the student's native language in her home environment is interfering with her development of English.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out this question. Let's read it carefully.

So, the student is 7 years old and came to the US a year ago from a non-English speaking country. She had high reading scores there. Now, she's fluent in social English but is struggling with the basal reader in her class. 

The tests show she's above average in speaking and listening compared to her English-speaking peers, but below in reading and writing. But in her native language, her reading is way above average.

The question is asking for the most accurate interpretation of this situation. The options are from A to J.

Let me think about what this means. She's good in her native reading, which suggests she has strong reading skills per se. But in English, she's behind in reading and writing, despite being fluent socially. 

I remember that there's a difference between social language (Basic Interpersonal Communication Skills - BICS) and academic language (Cognitive Academic Language Proficiency - CALP). Social language develops faster, maybe in a couple of years, while academic language can take much longer, like 5-7 years. So even though she's fluent socially, she's struggling with the more complex language needed for reading and writing in an academic setting.

Looking at the options:

Option G says the discrepancy between her English social skills and reading is expected because social skills are acquired in a richer context. That makes sense because social language is picked up through interaction, which is more contextual and supported, whereas reading and writing are more abstract and demanding.

Other options: 

Option A suggests English is more complex. That's possible, but the question says she's above average in her native reading, so maybe it's more about the kind of language skills rather than the language's inherent complexity.

Option B attributes it to teaching methods. The info doesn't mention anything about teaching, so that's speculative.

Option C says her native scores are misleading. But she did well there, so that's probably not it.

Option D is about adjusting to the environment. She's been there a year and is socially fluent, so adjustment doesn't seem to be the main issue.

Option E is about exposure to English literature. Maybe, but the tests show she's below in reading and writing, which might not be just literature but overall academic language.

Option F suggests speaking/listening is hindering reading. That doesn't make sense because they're different skills.

Option I says her difficulty is an early sign of academic problems. It's a possibility, but the question is about the current discrepancy, not future issues.

Option J talks about native language use at home. There's no info given about that interfering; in fact, using the native language can support overall literacy.

So the most accurate is probably G.

The student's situation reflects a common pattern in language development where social language skills (speaking and listening) develop more quickly than academic language skills (reading and writing). This discrepancy is expected because social language is acquired in richer, more contextual environments, whereas academic language requires more time and exposure to develop, especially in a new language. The student's high native language reading scores indicate strong foundational reading skills, which further supports the interpretation that her English reading difficulty is not due to a lack of ability but rather the challenge of mastering academic language in English.

Option G accurately captures this dynamic, as it highlights the expected gap between social and academic language proficiency due to differences in how these skills are acquired.

Answer: G
