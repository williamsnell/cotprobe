Okay, so I've got this problem here about Florsheimand Co. accepting a sight draft and then discounting it. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, let's break it down. The draft is for $425, and it's a 90-day sight draft accepted on October 10. They discounted it on November 1 at 5%. Oh, and the bank charged a 1/3% collection fee. I need to find the proceeds.

Wait, sight draft means that the bill is payable at sight, right? But since it's a 90-day draft, maybe it's actually a time draft. Or wait, maybe it's a sight draft that was accepted on October 10, so it's due 90 days from then. Or perhaps the discounting is done on November 1, which is when the bank takes it.

Wait, the draft is accepted on October 10, but it's discounted on November 1. So that's 22 days later. Because October has 31 days, so from October 10 to October 31 is 21 days, plus November 1 is the 22nd day.

So the draft is for 90 days, but it's being discounted 22 days after acceptance. So the time remaining until maturity is 90 minus 22 days, which is 68 days.

Wait, but when you discount a bill, you calculate the discount based on the time left. So the discount would be the face value multiplied by the discount rate multiplied by the time remaining in years.

So the discount is $425 * 5% * (68/365). Oh wait, but wait, the discounting rate is 5% annually, right? So that's correct.

Then, the bank also charges a 1/3% collection fee. So that's a flat fee based on the face value, I think. Or is it based on the discounted amount? Hmm, I'm not too sure. Wait, in the problem statement, it says the bank charged a (1/3)% collection fee. So probably, it's a fee on the face value, or on the amount being discounted.

Wait, let me think. When a bank discounts a bill, they subtract the discount and any fees from the face value. So the proceeds would be the face value minus the discount minus the collection fee. Or wait, sometimes the collection fee is a separate charge.

So maybe the calculation is: face value minus (discount + collection fee). Or perhaps the collection fee is calculated on the discounted amount. I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, let me outline the steps.

1. Calculate the discount on the draft for the remaining period.

Face value: $425.

Discount rate: 5% per annum.

Time remaining: from Nov 1 to Jan 8 (assuming Oct 10 +90 days is Jan 8). Wait, October 10 plus 90 days: October has 31 days, so from Oct 10 to Oct 31 is 22 days (including the 10th?), wait, no, from Oct 10, the next day is the 11th, so 31-10 = 21 days in October left, plus 90 days would take us to January 8, 2024? Wait, no, maybe I should calculate it more accurately.

Wait, October 10 is the acceptance date, so the due date is 90 days later. So October has 31 days, so from Oct 10 to Oct 31 is 22 days (including the 10th? Or is it 21 days? Because from 10th to 31st is 22 days including both days, but when counting days after, maybe it's 21. Hmm, maybe better to not get bogged down here and just take days between Oct 10 and Nov 1 as 22 days, as I thought earlier. So the remaining period is 90 -22 =68 days.

So discount calculation: 425 * 0.05 * (68/365).

Let me compute that.

First, 68/365 is approximately 0.1863.

0.05 * 0.1863 = 0.009315.

425 * 0.009315 = let's see.

425 * 0.009 = 3.825, and 425 * 0.000315= approx 0.133875. So total discount is about 3.958875, say $3.96.

So the discounted amount is $425 - $3.96 = $421.04.

But wait, the bank also charges a collection fee of 1/3%, which is 0.3333%.

Is this fee based on the face value or the discounted amount? Hmm, I think it's based on the face value, but I'm not certain.

If it's on the face value, then the fee is 425 * 0.003333 = approx $1.41625. So maybe $1.42.

So the proceeds would be the discounted amount minus the collection fee: $421.04 - $1.42 = approx $419.62.

Looking at the options, option D is $419.57, which is close. Hmm, maybe I made some rounding errors.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate it more precisely.

Let's do the discount again.

Discount = 425 * 0.05 * (68/365).

Compute 68/365 first: 68 ÷ 365 = 0.186301.

So 0.05 * 0.186301 = 0.00931505.

Multiply by 425: 425 * 0.00931505.

Let's compute 425 * 0.009 = 3.825.

425 * 0.00031505 = 425 * 0.0003 = 0.1275, and 425 * 0.00001505= approx 0.006403. So total 0.1275 + 0.006403 = 0.133903.

Adding to 3.825 gives 3.825 + 0.133903 = 3.958903. So discount is $3.9589, approximately $3.96.

So after discount, the amount is 425 -3.9589 = 421.0411.

Now, the collection fee is 1/3%, which is 0.3333% of what? If it's on the face value, 425 * 0.00333333 = 1.416666.

So subtract that from 421.0411: 421.0411 -1.416666 = 419.6244. So approximately $419.62.

Looking at the options, option D is $419.57. Hmm, that's very close. Maybe I should check if I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the collection fee is applied to the discounted amount, not the face value. Let me try that approach.

If the collection fee is 0.3333% of the discounted amount, which is 421.0411.

So 421.0411 * 0.00333333 = approx 1.4035.

Subtracting that from 421.0411 gives 421.0411 -1.4035 = 419.6376, which is about $419.64. Still, the closest option is D: $419.57.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately with exact numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps the collection fee is a flat fee, but I think it's a percentage. So let's recompute all components precisely.

Compute the discount:

Discount = 425 * 5% * (68/365) 

= 425 * 0.05 * (68/365)

Compute 68/365 = 0.186301370.

0.05 * 0.18630137 = 0.0093150685.

Then 425 * 0.0093150685 = let's compute.

425 * 0.009 = 3.825.

425 * 0.0003150685 = let's compute 425 * 0.0003 = 0.1275, and 425 * 0.0000150685 = 0.0064104125.

So total for 0.0003150685 is 0.1275 + 0.0064104125 = 0.1339104125.

Add to 3.825: 3.825 + 0.1339104125 = 3.9589104125.

So discount is $3.9589104125. So $3.95891.

Proceeds after discount: 425 - 3.95891 = 421.0410887.

Now, the collection fee is 1/3% on what? If on the face value, it's 425 * (1/3)/100 = 425 * (0.003333333) = 1.416666666.

So subtract that from 421.0410887: 421.0410887 -1.416666666 = 419.624422.

So approximately $419.62. The options don't have this exact number, but option D is $419.57, which is a bit lower. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the time calculation is different. Maybe the time period is 22 days from Oct 10 to Nov 1, so the remaining days are 90 -22 =68 days. But I'm not sure if the day of discounting (Nov 1) is included or not. For example, if the draft was accepted on Oct 10, and discounted on Nov 1, is the period between Oct 10 and Nov 1 22 days or 21 days?

Wait, October 10 to October 31 is 22 days (including the 10th?), no, wait. From the 10th to the 31st, there are 22 days (including both the 10th and 31st). But when calculating the number of days from Oct 10 to Nov 1, that's 22 days: Oct 10 is day 1, Oct 31 is day 22, and Nov 1 is day 23? No, wait, that can't be right. Because from Oct 10 to Oct 31 is 22 days (since 31-10=21, but including the start day makes it 22). Then adding Nov 1 would make it 23 days. Wait, no, wait: the period from Oct 10 (inclusive) to Oct 31 (inclusive) is 22 days, and Nov 1 is the next day, so from Oct 10 to Nov 1 inclusive is 23 days. But when the draft is discounted on Nov 1, that day is not part of the period remaining. Hmm, perhaps this is where the confusion is.

Wait, the draft is accepted on Oct 10, so it's due on Jan 8 (assuming 90 days later). If it's discounted on Nov 1, that's 23 days after Oct 10 (since from Oct 10 to Nov 1 is 23 days, including both days). So 90 days total, so remaining days would be 90 -23=67 days.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recalculate with 67 days.

So discount = 425 * 0.05 * (67/365) = ?

67/365 is approximately 0.1835616.

0.05 * 0.1835616 = 0.00917808.

425 * 0.00917808 = ?

Well, 400 * 0.00917808 = 3.67123.

25 * 0.00917808 = 0.229454.

So total is 3.67123 + 0.229454 ≈ 3.900684.

So discount is $3.900684.

Proceeds after discount: 425 -3.900684 = 421.099316.

Now, the collection fee is 1/3% on $425: 425 * 0.00333333 = 1.41666667.

Subtracting that: 421.099316 -1.41666667 = 419.68265.

Hmm, that's about $419.68, which is closer to option D: $419.57, but still not exact.

Wait, perhaps the time is calculated differently. Maybe the days are counted as 365 days, but perhaps it's based on 360 days (banker's year). Oh, that's a possibility I didn't consider.

If the discount calculation uses 360 days instead of 365, then the discount would be:

discount = 425 * 0.05 * (68/360) or (67/360).

Wait, let me think. If using 360 days, then for 68 days, it's 68/360=0.188888.

0.05 * 0.188888 = 0.0094444.

425 * 0.0094444 = approx 4.01396.

So discount is $4.014, making proceeds after discount 425-4.014=420.986.

Then subtract collection fee of 1/3% on 425: 1.416666.

So 420.986 - 1.416666 ≈ 419.569. Oh, that's very close to option D: $419.57.

So perhaps the correct approach uses a 360-day year for discounting.

So the steps would be:

1. Calculate the discount: 425 * 5% * (68/360).

   - 68/360 = 0.188888...
   - 0.05 * 0.188888 = 0.0094444
   - 425 * 0.0094444 = 4.01396.

2. Subtract discount from face value: 425 - 4.01396 = 420.98604.

3. Subtract collection fee of (1/3)% on 425: 425 * (1/3)/100 = 1.416666...

4. So proceeds = 420.98604 - 1.416666 = 419.56937, which is approximately $419.57.

That matches option D exactly.

So the correct answer is D: $419.57.

To determine the proceeds from discounting the 90-day sight draft, we need to calculate the discount and the collection fee, then subtract both from the face value of the draft. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

### 1. **Calculate the Discount**
The draft is for $425, and the discount rate is 5% per annum. The time remaining until maturity is calculated as follows:
- The draft is accepted on October 10 and discounted on November 1, which is **22 days** later.
- The remaining period is \( 90 - 22 = 68 \) days.

Using a **360-day year** for the discount calculation:
\[
\text{Discount} = 425 \times 0.05 \times \left(\frac{68}{360}\right)
\]
\[
\frac{68}{360} = 0.188888 \quad \text{and} \quad 0.05 \times 0.188888 = 0.009444
\]
\[
\text{Discount} = 425 \times 0.009444 = 4.01396 \, \text{(approximately \$4.014)}.
\]

### 2. **Calculate the Collection Fee**
The bank charges a \( \frac{1}{3}\% \) collection fee, which is based on the face value of the draft:
\[
\text{Collection Fee} = 425 \times \left(\frac{1}{3}\%\right) = 425 \times 0.003333 = 1.416666 \, \text{(approximately \$1.417)}.
\]

### 3. **Calculate the Proceeds**
The proceeds are the face value minus the discount and the collection fee:
\[
\text{Proceeds} = 425 - 4.014 - 1.417 = 419.569 \, \text{(approximately \$419.57)}.
\]

### 4. **Verify the Closest Option**
The calculated proceeds of \$419.57 match **option D** exactly.

### Final Answer:
**D: \$419.57**
