Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the thermal decomposition of ferrous sulfate. Hmm, I remember that when a solid decomposes, it often produces gases, and we need to find the equilibrium constant Kp and then the total pressure under certain conditions. 

The reaction given is 2 FeSO4(s) → Fe2O3(s) + SO2(g) + SO3(g). So, the solids are FeSO4 and Fe2O3, and the products are the gases SO2 and SO3. 

Part (a) says that at 929 K, the total gas pressure is 0.9 atm when both solids are present. I'm supposed to calculate Kp. Wait, Kp is the equilibrium constant in terms of partial pressures. 

Since both FeSO4 and Fe2O3 are solids, their activities are 1, so they don't appear in the K expression. That means Kp will be based on the partial pressures of SO2 and SO3.

The balanced equation shows that for every 2 moles of FeSO4 decomposed, we get 1 mole of Fe2O3, 1 mole of SO2, and 1 mole of SO3. So, the stoichiometric coefficients for the gases are both 1. 

At equilibrium, the total gas pressure is 0.9 atm, which is the sum of the partial pressures of SO2 and SO3. Let's denote the partial pressure of SO2 as P_SO2 and SO3 as P_SO3. So, P_total = P_SO2 + P_SO3 = 0.9 atm.

Since the stoichiometric coefficients for both gases are the same (1 each), their partial pressures should be equal because they're produced in a 1:1 ratio. So P_SO2 = P_SO3 = x. Then 2x = 0.9 atm → x = 0.45 atm each.

So, Kp is the product of their partial pressures. Kp = P_SO2 * P_SO3 = (0.45) * (0.45) = 0.2025 atm². Wait, looking at the options, J says Kp is 0.203 atm², which is close to 0.2025. So part (a) answer is J's Kp value.

But wait, let me double-check. Oh wait, no, wait. The reaction is 2 FeSO4 → Fe2O3 + SO2 + SO3. So the moles of SO2 and SO3 are each 1 mole per 2 moles of FeSO4. So yes, their partial pressures are each x, and 2x is total pressure 0.9 atm. So each is 0.45 atm.

So Kp = (0.45)(0.45) = 0.2025 ≈ 0.203. So the Kp is 0.203 atm². Looking at the options, option J gives Kp as 0.203 atm², and part (b) gives a total pressure of 1.082 atm. But I need to calculate part (b) as well.

Part (b) says that excess ferrous sulfate is placed in a flask at 929 K, which initially contains SO2 at 0.6 atm. So, the setup is that there's excess FeSO4(s), so it will decompose to reach equilibrium. But since the system starts with some SO2, we might have to see if the reaction proceeds forward or reverse.

Wait, the initial condition is SO2 pressure of 0.6 atm. But the reaction produces both SO2 and SO3. So, the initial partial pressures are: SO2 = 0.6 atm, SO3 = 0 atm.

Let me think about how to model this. Let me denote the change as 'x' being the increase in pressure for both SO2 and SO3. Wait, no: because the reaction produces 1 mole each of SO2 and SO3 per 2 moles FeSO4, so their changes should be equal.

Wait, the reaction: 2 FeSO4 → Fe2O3 + SO2 + SO3.

At equilibrium, let the change from initial be x for each gas. So initial SO2 is 0.6 atm, and initial SO3 is 0.

So:

SO2: 0.6 + x

SO3: 0 + x

But wait, the stoichiometry is 1 mole each, so the change should be the same for both. So yes, the partial pressures would be 0.6 + x for SO2 and x for SO3.

But wait, is that correct? Because the reaction produces both gases in a 1:1 ratio. So any additional production would add x to each. So the initial SO2 is 0.6, and as the reaction proceeds, both SO2 and SO3 increase by x.

Wait, no. Alternatively, perhaps the system is starting with some SO2 but no SO3, and the decomposition will produce more of both. So let me set up an ICE table.

Initial:
P_SO2 = 0.6 atm
P_SO3 = 0 atm

Change:
Let x be the amount of SO2 produced, so SO3 also increases by x.

Equilibrium:
P_SO2 = 0.6 + x
P_SO3 = x

Now, Kp is (0.6 + x)(x) = 0.203 atm².

So we have the equation (0.6 + x)(x) = 0.203.

Expanding it: 0.6x + x² = 0.203 → x² + 0.6x - 0.203 = 0.

Solving this quadratic equation:

x = [-0.6 ± sqrt( (0.6)^2 + 4*1*0.203 ) ] / 2

Calculating discriminant: 0.36 + 0.812 = 1.172

sqrt(1.172) ≈ 1.082

So x = [-0.6 + 1.082 ] / 2 = (0.482)/2 ≈ 0.241 atm.

The other root is negative, so we discard it.

So x ≈ 0.241 atm.

Thus, equilibrium pressures:

SO2: 0.6 + 0.241 = 0.841 atm

SO3: 0.241 atm

Total pressure is 0.841 + 0.241 = 1.082 atm.

So the total pressure is approximately 1.082 atm, which matches option J's part (b) value, which is 1.082 atm.

So the answers for (a) and (b) are Kp=0.203 atm² and total pressure=1.082 atm, which is option J.

The problem involves the thermal decomposition of ferrous sulfate:  

$$2 \text{FeSO}_4(s) \rightarrow \text{Fe}_2\text{O}_3(s) + \text{SO}_2(g) + \text{SO}_3(g).$$  

### Part (a): Calculate \(K_p\) at 929 K  
At equilibrium, the total gas pressure is 0.9 atm, which is the sum of the partial pressures of \(\text{SO}_2\) and \(\text{SO}_3\). Since the stoichiometric coefficients for both gases are equal (1:1), their partial pressures are equal. Let the partial pressure of each gas be \(x\). Then:  
\[
x + x = 0.9 \implies 2x = 0.9 \implies x = 0.45 \, \text{atm}.
\]  
Thus, the partial pressures of \(\text{SO}_2\) and \(\text{SO}_3\) are both 0.45 atm. The equilibrium constant \(K_p\) is given by:  
\[
K_p = P_{\text{SO}_2} \cdot P_{\text{SO}_3} = (0.45)(0.45) = 0.2025 \, \text{atm}^2.
\]  
Rounding to match the options, \(K_p = 0.203 \, \text{atm}^2\).  

### Part (b): Calculate the total equilibrium pressure with initial \(\text{SO}_2 = 0.6 \, \text{atm}\)  
Initially, \(\text{SO}_2 = 0.6 \, \text{atm}\) and \(\text{SO}_3 = 0 \, \text{atm}\). Let \(x\) represent the increase in the partial pressure of each gas due to the reaction. At equilibrium:  
\[
P_{\text{SO}_2} = 0.6 + x, \quad P_{\text{SO}_3} = x.
\]  
Substituting into the equilibrium constant expression:  
\[
K_p = (0.6 + x)(x) = 0.203.
\]  
Expanding and rearranging:  
\[
x^2 + 0.6x - 0.203 = 0.
\]  
Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:  
\[
x = \frac{-0.6 \pm \sqrt{(0.6)^2 + 4(1)(0.203)}}{2}.
\]  
The discriminant is:  
\[
(0.6)^2 + 4(0.203) = 0.36 + 0.812 = 1.172.
\]  
\[
x = \frac{-0.6 \pm \sqrt{1.172}}{2}.
\]  
\[
\sqrt{1.172} \approx 1.082 \implies x = \frac{-0.6 + 1.082}{2} = 0.241 \, \text{atm}.
\]  
At equilibrium:  
\[
P_{\text{SO}_2} = 0.6 + 0.241 = 0.841 \, \text{atm}, \quad P_{\text{SO}_3} = 0.241 \, \text{atm}.
\]  
The total pressure is:  
\[
P_{\text{total}} = P_{\text{SO}_2} + P_{\text{SO}_3} = 0.841 + 0.241 = 1.082 \, \text{atm}.
\]  

### Final Answer  
For part (a), \(K_p = 0.203 \, \text{atm}^2\). For part (b), the total equilibrium pressure is \(1.082 \, \text{atm}\). Both values match option **J**.
