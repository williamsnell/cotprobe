Okay, so I've got this question about Rogerian therapy, and I'm supposed to figure out the major task of a Rogerian or client-oriented therapist. Hmm, I remember that Carl Rogers was a big name in psychology. Let me think about what I learned about his approach.

Wait, Rogerian therapy is also called person-centered therapy, right? So the focus is on the client and their own ability to grow and change. I think the therapist's role is more about creating a supportive environment rather than directing the client or telling them what to do.

So the options are A through J. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Conduct psychological tests. No, I don't think that's right. Rogerian therapy isn't about testing; it's more about the therapeutic relationship.

Option B: Prescribe medication. No way, that's for psychiatrists, not typically what a Rogerian therapist does. They focus on talk therapy.

Option C: Analyze past traumas every session. That sounds more like Freudian psychoanalysis, not Rogers. He might touch on past issues, but not the main focus every time.

Option D: Find a cure. I don't think so. Rogers' approach is more about facilitating self-actualization, not curing in a medical sense.

Option E: Judge and evaluate. No, the opposite. Rogers emphasizes unconditional positive regard, so no judgment.

Option F: Change behaviors with reinforcement. That's more behaviorist, like Skinner. Rogerian is humanistic, so it's about personal growth, not behavioral techniques.

Option G: Interpret behavior. That might be more of a psychodynamic approach. Rogers doesn't interpret; he reflects.

Option H: Provide direct solutions. No, the client finds their own solutions. The therapist doesn't give advice.

Option I: Establish an atmosphere for openness. That rings a bell. The three core conditions: empathy, congruence, and unconditional positive regard. Creating a safe space for the client to explore.

Option J: Challenge beliefs. That could be cognitive-behavioral therapy. Rogers doesn't challenge; he supports and reflects.

So the correct answer should be I. The major task is to create an environment where the client feels open and able to experience their feelings.

The major task of a Rogerian (or client-oriented) therapist is to establish an atmosphere that allows the client to feel safe and open to experiencing their emotions. This approach, known as person-centered therapy, emphasizes the therapeutic relationship and the core conditions of empathy, congruence, and unconditional positive regard. The therapist's role is not to direct, judge, or provide solutions but to facilitate the client's self-exploration and growth.

Answer: I
