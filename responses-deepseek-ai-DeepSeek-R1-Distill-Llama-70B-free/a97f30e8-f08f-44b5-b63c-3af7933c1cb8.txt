Okay, so I have this question about the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and its impact on school desegregation in the South. Hmm, I remember that the Civil Rights Act was a significant piece of legislation during the civil rights movement. But wait, what exactly did it do regarding schools?

The question gives me options A through J. I need to pick the correct one. Let me think about each option.

Option A says it mandated a quota system. I don't recall the Civil Rights Act having quotas. That sounds more like affirmative action policies that came later. So probably not A.

Option B claims it immediately desegregated all Southern schools. I think that's not right because I remember hearing that desegregation took time and faced a lot of resistance. It wasn't immediate.

Option C suggests it had no effect because no enforcement. But I know the Act did have some enforcement mechanisms. Like, it allowed the federal government to withhold funds or file lawsuits against schools that didn't comply. So C is probably incorrect.

Option D states it made segregation illegal without enforcement. Wait, no, the Act did have enforcement provisions. So D is wrong because it says no means for enforcement.

Option E says it only affected universities. But I think it applied to all public schools, not just higher education. So E is incorrect.

Option F claims it overturned "separate but equal." Wait, wasn't that the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision in 1954? The Civil Rights Act was legislation, so F might be mixing up the two. Brown overturned the principle, but the Act enforced it. So F is probably wrong.

Option G says it increased segregation due to backlash. I don't think that's right. The Act aimed to reduce segregation, though there was backlash, but the statement says it increased, which I don't agree with.

Option H suggests federal troops were sent everywhere. No, that sounds like the enforcement during specific events, like when schools refused to integrate. For example, President Eisenhower sent troops to Little Rock, but the Act didn't automatically send troops everywhere. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Hastened desegregation by cutting off federal funds. Oh, right! The Civil Rights Act allowed the government to withhold federal funding from schools that didn't desegregate. This was a powerful incentive. So I think I is correct.

Option J says it had no direct impact but provided a basis. No, because the Act did have direct measures, like the funding part. So J is wrong.

Wait, let me double-check. The Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title VI, prohibits discrimination by institutions receiving federal funds. So the government could cut off funds to schools that remained segregated, which pushed them to desegregate. That aligns with option I.

So the correct answer should be I.

The Civil Rights Act of 1964 had a significant impact on school desegregation in the South by incorporating enforcement mechanisms. Specifically, Title VI of the Act prohibited discrimination in institutions receiving federal funds, allowing the government to withhold funding from schools that failed to desegregate. This provision incentivized compliance and hastened the process of desegregation. 

Option I correctly captures this by stating that the Act "hastened school desegregation by cutting off federal funds to discriminatory school systems." 

Answer: I
