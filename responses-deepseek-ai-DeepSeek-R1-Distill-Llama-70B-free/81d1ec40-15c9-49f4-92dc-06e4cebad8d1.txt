Question:

In very basic terms describe the structure of a retroviral virion.

Options:

A: The virion is composed of the DNA genome, a surrounding protein capsid, and an inner lipid bilayer envelope.
B: The virion is composed of the RNA genome, a surrounding carbohydrate capsid, and an outer protein bilayer envelope.
C: The virion is composed solely of an RNA genome.
D: The virion is composed of the RNA genome and an outer carbohydrate bilayer envelope, without a capsid.
E: The virion is composed of the RNA genome, a surrounding protein capsid, and an outer lipid bilayer envelope.
F: The virion is composed of the DNA genome, a surrounding carbohydrate capsid, and an outer lipid bilayer envelope.
G: The virion is composed of the DNA genome, a surrounding lipid bilayer capsid, and an outer carbohydrate envelope.
H: The virion is composed of the RNA genome, a surrounding carbohydrate capsid, and an inner protein bilayer envelope.
I: The virion is composed of the RNA genome, a surrounding lipid bilayer capsid, and an inner protein envelope.
J: The virion is composed of a protein genome, a surrounding carbohydrate capsid, and an outer lipid bilayer envelope.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the structure of a retroviral virion. Hmm, I remember that retroviruses are a type of virus, and I think they have a certain structure. Let me think about what I learned in my biology class.

First, I recall that all viruses have a genome, which is either DNA or RNA. Retroviruses, as the name suggests, have RNA as their genetic material. Wait, right, they're RNA viruses. So the genome should be RNA, not DNA. So any option that says DNA genome is probably wrong. Let me look through the options.

Option A says DNA genome, so that's out. Option B has RNA, but it mentions a carbohydrate capsid. I don't think capsids are made of carbohydrates. Viral capsids are protein, I believe. So B might be incorrect. Option C says only RNA, but that can't be right because viruses have more structure than that. They have a capsid and sometimes an envelope.

Option D: RNA genome, outer carbohydrate envelope, no capsid. Wait, no capsid? I think all virions have a capsid, which is the protein shell around the genome. So D probably isn't right. Option E: RNA, protein capsid, lipid envelope. That sounds familiar. I think retroviruses are enveloped viruses, so they have a lipid bilayer envelope derived from the host cell membrane when they bud out. The capsid is made of proteins arranged in a shell around the RNA.

Option F: DNA genome again, so wrong. G and H: DNA and different structures, so no. I: RNA, lipid bilayer capsid? Wait, capsid is protein, not lipid. So I is incorrect. J: protein genome, which is wrong because the genome is RNA.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be E. Retroviruses have an RNA genome, a protein capsid surrounding it, and an outer lipid bilayer envelope.

The correct answer is E. Retroviruses have an RNA genome surrounded by a protein capsid and an outer lipid bilayer envelope.
