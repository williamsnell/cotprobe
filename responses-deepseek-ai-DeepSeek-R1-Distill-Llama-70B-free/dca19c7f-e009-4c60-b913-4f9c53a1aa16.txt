Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a patient with insomnia, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The patient is a 76-year-old man who comes in because he's been waking up early at night. He falls asleep fine but wakes up between 2-3 AM. His history includes diabetes controlled by diet. He drinks one coffee in the morning and one alcoholic beverage before bed. He's physically active, doesn't snore, no depression, nightmares, or OTC medications. His wife is healthy, and the physical exam is normal except his pulse is a bit high at 96.

The question is about the most appropriate management for his insomnia. The options are A through J, each suggesting a different approach.

First, I'll think about the possible causes of his insomnia. Early morning awakening is a common symptom in various conditions. One possibility is depression, but the question says he has no history of depression, so that's probably not it. Another thought is sleep hygiene issues. Let me look at his habits.

He drinks one coffee in the morning, which is probably not causing issues since it's only one cup. But he also has an alcoholic beverage before bed. Alcohol can disrupt sleep patterns. It might help him fall asleep faster, but it can cause lighter, less restorative sleep and lead to early awakening. So that's a red flag.

Other factors: He's 76, so age-related sleep changes could be a factor, but that's more about having more fragmented sleep. He's not on any medications that could cause insomnia. His physical exam is normal, so no obvious medical issues causing it.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: Watch TV before bed. That's not good sleep hygiene. Screen time can interfere with sleep, so probably not the best advice.

Option B: Prescribe sleeping pills. Considering his age and potential for side effects or dependency, this might not be the first choice. Plus, the question doesn't mention trying behavioral changes first.

Option C: Read and snack in bed. Snacking in bed could lead to eating in bed, which isn't great for sleep hygiene. Also, eating before bed can sometimes cause indigestion, though he doesn't have that issue. Reading might be okay, but if he's already having trouble staying asleep, maybe it's better to associate the bed with sleep only.

Option D: Daytime nap. Taking a nap might help with lost sleep, but it can also interfere with nighttime sleep, making it harder to fall asleep or stay asleep. So maybe not the best option here.

Option E: Vigorous exercise before bed. Exercise is good, but doing it too close to bedtime can actually interfere with sleep because it can increase adrenaline and make it harder to wind down.

Option F: Prescribe sertraline. That's an SSRI antidepressant. Since he's not depressed, this might not be appropriate. Also, without a diagnosis of depression, it's probably unnecessary.

Option G: Low-carb diet. Not sure how that relates to insomnia unless he's having issues with blood sugar at night, but he's controlled on diet, so maybe not relevant.

Option H: Discontinue bedtime alcohol. This seems promising because alcohol can disrupt sleep patterns. Stopping it might help him sleep through the night better.

Option I: Drink alcohol earlier in the day. If he drinks earlier, maybe the effects wear off by bedtime, but it's still alcohol consumption. But maybe he doesn't need to stop entirely, just adjust timing. But some studies suggest that even moderate alcohol can disrupt sleep, so stopping might be better.

Option J: Increase caffeine. That's the opposite of what he should do. More caffeine could make his insomnia worse, especially if consumed in the afternoon or evening.

Putting it all together, the most likely cause is the evening alcohol. So advising him to stop having that before bed (Option H) makes the most sense. Other options either don't address the issue or could make it worse.

The patient is a 76-year-old man with early awakening insomnia, waking up between 2:00 and 3:00 AM. He has no history of depression, nightmares, or snoring, and his physical exam is normal. Key factors contributing to his insomnia include his consumption of an alcoholic beverage before bed, as alcohol can disrupt sleep patterns and lead to early awakening. Other habits, such as morning coffee and exercise, are unlikely to be causing his insomnia. 

Among the options provided, advising the patient to discontinue his bedtime drink of alcohol (Option H) is the most appropriate management. Alcohol consumption before bed is a known disruptor of sleep quality and addressing this could improve his ability to sleep through the night. Other options, such as prescribing sleeping pills (Option B) or recommending screen time before bed (Option A), are either less appropriate or could worsen the issue. Increasing caffeine (Option J) or vigorous exercise before bed (Option E) would also be counterproductive. Therefore, the best recommendation is to stop the bedtime alcohol.
