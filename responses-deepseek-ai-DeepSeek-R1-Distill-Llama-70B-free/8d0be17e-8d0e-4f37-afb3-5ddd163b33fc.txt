Okay, so I have this question about the banking system and the money-creating potential. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it.

The question says that demand deposits are $80,000,000 and reserves are $17,000,000. The legal reserve ratio is 10%. Then the Fed doubles the required ratio, so I guess it goes up to 20%. I need to find out by how much the money-creating potential drops.

Wait, I remember that the money multiplier is involved here. The formula for the money multiplier is 1 divided by the reserve ratio. So initially, the multiplier would be 1/0.10, which is 10. That means the banking system can create up to 10 times the excess reserves in deposits.

Wait, no. Wait, actually, the money-creating potential is based on the excess reserves. So first, I need to figure out the excess reserves before and after the change. Because the required reserves change when the ratio changes.

Let me think. Initially, the reserve ratio is 10%, so required reserves are 10% of demand deposits. So required reserves would be 0.10 * 80,000,000 = $8,000,000. But the banks currently have $17,000,000 in reserves. So excess reserves are 17,000,000 - 8,000,000 = $9,000,000.

Okay, so with a money multiplier of 10, the potential money creation is excess reserves times the multiplier. So 9,000,000 * 10 = $90,000,000. But wait, the question is about the money-creating potential of the system. So that's the initial potential.

Then, the Fed doubles the required ratio to 20%. Now, the new required reserves are 0.20 * 80,000,000 = $16,000,000. But the banks' reserves are still $17,000,000. So excess reserves become 17,000,000 - 16,000,000 = $1,000,000.

Now, the money multiplier is 1/0.20 = 5. So the new money-creating potential is 1,000,000 * 5 = $5,000,000.

So the initial potential was $90 million, and it drops to $5 million. That's a decrease of $85 million. Wait, but the question is asking by how much it will drop. So the potential was 90, now it's 5, so the drop is 85 million. Or wait, the question is phrased as "by how much will the money-creating potential... drop?" So if it was 90 and now 5, that's a drop of 85 million.

Looking at the options, I'm looking for an option that shows a drop from $90,000,000 to $5,000,000. Let me check the options.

Option G is $90,000,000 to $5,000,000. So that's the one.

Wait, wait. Did I calculate the initial money-creating potential correctly? Because sometimes people might confuse the actual money created versus the potential. The question definitely says the potential of the system as a whole. So yes, it's based on the excess reserves and the multiplier.

Another way: The formula for the potential is (Excess Reserves) * (Money Multiplier). So initial excess was 9 million, multiplier 10, gives 90. After, excess is 1 million, multiplier 5, gives 5. So yeah, the potential drops from 90 to 5. So the correct option is G.

The question involves calculating the money-creating potential of the banking system before and after the Federal Reserve doubles the legal reserve ratio. Initially, demand deposits are $80,000,000, reserves are $17,000,000, and the legal reserve ratio is 10%. 

1. **Initial Scenario**:  
   - Required reserves = $80,000,000 * 10% = $8,000,000.  
   - Excess reserves = Total reserves - Required reserves = $17,000,000 - $8,000,000 = $9,000,000.  
   - Money multiplier = 1 / Reserve ratio = 1 / 0.10 = 10.  
   - Money-creating potential = Excess reserves * Money multiplier = $9,000,000 * 10 = $90,000,000.  

2. **After the Reserve Ratio Doubles**:  
   - New reserve ratio = 20%.  
   - Required reserves = $80,000,000 * 20% = $16,000,000.  
   - Excess reserves = Total reserves - Required reserves = $17,000,000 - $16,000,000 = $1,000,000.  
   - Money multiplier = 1 / Reserve ratio = 1 / 0.20 = 5.  
   - Money-creating potential = Excess reserves * Money multiplier = $1,000,000 * 5 = $5,000,000.  

The money-creating potential drops from $90,000,000 to $5,000,000. Among the options provided, the correct answer is **G: $90,000,000 to $5,000,000**.
