Okay, so I have this question about calculating the molecular translational partition functions for different molecules. Hmm, I remember that the translational partition function is given by the formula q_trans = (V / λ³) * (2πmkT/h²)^(3/2), but wait, maybe it's simplified when using certain units. Oh right, I think another version of the formula is q = (V)(2πmkT)^(3/2) / h³ when using appropriate units. Or wait, maybe it's more straightforward when using the root mean square speed or something. Alternatively, sometimes people use the formula q = (2.319 × 10^-9) * (T^(3/2)) * sqrt(M) * V, but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, I should probably get the exact formula right. The translational partition function is q_trans = (sqrt(2) * (m k T)^(3/2) * V) / (h³). But since all the molecules are in the same volume and temperature, maybe I can compare their molar masses because the partition function depends on the square root of the molar mass. Wait, no, wait, let me think again.

The formula can be expressed as q = (V)(2πmkT)^(3/2) / h³. So m is the mass of a molecule. So the partition function is proportional to (m)^(3/2) because (2πmkT)^(3/2) would be proportional to m^(3/2).

So for each molecule, I can calculate their molar masses, find the molecular mass m, compute (m)^(3/2), and then find the ratio with a reference. But wait, wait. Let's get the exact approach.

I think another approach is to use the formula with molar masses. The translational partition function can also be written as q_trans = ( (2πmkT)^(3/2) * V ) / h³. But since we're comparing different molecules, perhaps it's easier to compute each value individually.

Let me list the given molecules:

a) H₂
b) CH₄
c) C₈H₁₈

We can calculate the molar mass for each.

H₂: molar mass is 2 g/mol.
CH₄: molar mass is 16 g/mol (12 + 4).
C₈H₁₈: molar mass is 114 g/mol (8*12 + 18*1 = 96 +18=114).

Wait, but wait, the mass m is per molecule. So for each molecule, m = (M) / (N_A), where M is molar mass and N_A is Avogadro's number.

But perhaps I can use the formula in terms of M. Let me recall that the translational partition function can also be written as q = ( (2π (M) (R) T )^(3/2) * V ) / ( h³ N_A^{3/2} ) ), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, another version is q = (V) / (λ³), where λ is the thermal wavelength. And λ is given by h / sqrt(2πmkT). Wait, but putting it all together, perhaps the formula can be expressed as:

q_trans = (V)(2πmkT)^(3/2) / h³.

But m is the mass of a single molecule. So m = M_molar / N_A. So substituting that in:

q = V * (2π (M/(N_A)) k T)^(3/2) / h³.

Alternatively, I think there's a simplified formula when using certain units. Let me think about the formula when using V in cm³, T in Kelvin, and M in g/mol. Oh right, I remember that when V is in cm³, T in K, and M in g/mol, the translational partition function can be approximated with:

q = (2.319 × 10^30) * V * (T)^(3/2) * sqrt(M) / (M^(3/2)).

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to use the formula with constants adjusted for the units. I think the correct formula is:

q_trans = ( (2π m k T)^(3/2) * V ) / h³.

But it's easier to compute when plugging in the constants with appropriate units.

Let me try to recall the constants. Planck's constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s. Boltzmann's constant k is 1.38e-23 J/K. The volume V is given in cm³; I should convert it to m³ because the standard SI units would require that. 1 cm³ is 1e-6 m³.

Wait, maybe there's a shortcut. I remember that when using V in cm^3, T in Kelvin, and M in g/mol, the formula can be expressed as:

q_trans = ( (2.319e-9) * V * sqrt(M) * (T) )^(3/2) ) ?

Wait, perhaps it's better to use the formula as:

q = ( (2π m k T )^(3/2) * V ) / h³.

So let's compute each part step by step.

First, let's note down all the constants and values:

V = 1 cm³ = 1e-6 m³ (since 1 m³ = 1e6 L = 1e6 * 1e3 cm³? Wait, wait. 1 m³ is (10^2 cm)^3 = 1e6 cm³. So 1 cm³ is 1e-6 m³.

Temperature T = 298 K.

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s.

k = 1.380649e-23 J/K.

For each molecule, compute m (mass per molecule) as M_molar/(N_A), where N_A is Avogadro's number, 6.02214076e23 mol⁻¹.

So let's compute m for each:

a) H₂: M = 2 g/mol = 0.002 kg/mol.

m_H2 = 0.002 kg/mol / 6.022e23 mol⁻¹ = 3.32e-27 kg.

b) CH₄: M = 16 g/mol = 0.016 kg/mol.

m_CH4 = 0.016 / 6.022e23 = approx 2.66e-26 kg.

c) C₈H₁₈: M = 114 g/mol = 0.114 kg/mol.

m_C8H18 = 0.114 / 6.022e23 ≈ 1.89e-25 kg.

Now, let's compute the term (2π m k T)^(3/2) for each, multiply by V, then divide by h³.

So the formula is:

q = [ (2 π m k T )^(3/2) * V ] / (h^3 )

Let me compute each part step by step for each molecule.

Starting with H₂:

Compute 2 π m k T:

2 * π * 3.32e-27 kg * 1.38e-23 J/K * 298 K.

Let me compute this.

First compute 2π : approx 6.2832.

6.2832 * 3.32e-27 = approx 2.086e-26.

Multiply by k: 1.38e-23.

2.086e-26 * 1.38e-23 = approx 2.886e-49.

Multiply by T=298: 2.886e-49 * 298 ≈ 8.60e-46.

Wait, but wait, that's 2π m k T. Now, take (2π m k T)^(3/2).

So (8.60e-46)^(3/2). Let's compute that.

The square root of 8.6e-46 is approx 9.27e-23. Then cube that: (9.27e-23)^3 = approx 8.0e-68.

Wait, but wait, let me compute it more accurately. Let's take it step by step.

Wait, (x)^(3/2) is x * sqrt(x).

So 8.6e-46 * sqrt(8.6e-46).

sqrt(8.6e-46) = sqrt(8.6) * 1e-23.

sqrt(8.6) ≈ 2.933. So sqrt ≈ 2.933e-23.

Multiply by 8.6e-46: 8.6e-46 * 2.933e-23 = approx 25.23e-69 = 2.523e-68.

So (2π m k T)^(3/2) ≈ 2.523e-68 (units: (J·s²/m²)^3/2? Not sure, but moving on).

Now multiply by V, which is 1e-6 m³.

2.523e-68 * 1e-6 = 2.523e-74.

Now divide by h^3.

h is 6.626e-34 J·s. So h³ is (6.626e-34)^3 = approx 2.902e-101 J³·s³.

So q = (2.523e-74) / (2.902e-101) ) ≈ 8.69e26.

Wait, that's for H₂. But looking at the options, the H₂ values are in the order of 1e24 to 4e24. That can't be right. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I made a calculation error. Let me recheck the steps.

Wait, when I computed 2 π m k T for H₂:

m = 3.32e-27 kg.

So 2 * π * 3.32e-27 = 2.08e-26.

Multiply by k (1.38e-23): 2.08e-26 * 1.38e-23 = let's compute 2e-26 *1.38e-23 = 2.76e-49. Then 0.08e-26 *1.38e-23 is 0.1104e-49, so total is 2.76e-49 + 0.1104e-49 = approx 2.87e-49.

Multiply by T=298: 2.87e-49 * 298 ≈ 8.56e-47.

Wait, earlier I thought it was 8.6e-46. Oh wait, no. 2.87e-49 * 298 is 2.87e-49 * 3e2 ≈ 8.61e-47, not 8.6e-46. So that was a mistake.

So 8.56e-47.

Now, (8.56e-47)^(3/2) = 8.56e-47 * sqrt(8.56e-47).

sqrt(8.56e-47) is sqrt(8.56) * 1e-23.5. Wait, 1e-47 is (1e-23.5)^2, so sqrt(1e-47) is 1e-23.5 = 3.16e-24.

sqrt(8.56) is approx 2.926. So sqrt(8.56e-47) ≈ 2.926e-23.5 ≈ 2.926 * 3.16e-24 ≈ 9.26e-24.

So (8.56e-47)^(3/2) = 8.56e-47 * 9.26e-24 = approx 7.93e-70.

Now multiply by V=1e-6 m³: 7.93e-70 * 1e-6 = 7.93e-76.

Divide by h^3.

h^3 = (6.626e-34)^3 ≈ 6.626^3 * 1e-102. 6.626^3 is approx 290, so 2.90e-101.

So q = (7.93e-76) / (2.90e-101) ) ≈ 2.737e25.

Wait, that's about 2.74e25. But looking at the options, the H₂ values are in the low 1e24 to 4e24 range. Hmm, so perhaps I made another mistake. Alternatively, maybe I should use a different formula or check the units.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula with V in liters. Because when V is in liters, the formula might adjust the constants. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: Use the formula for the translational partition function in terms of V in cm³, T in K, and m in atomic mass units (u). Because sometimes the formula is expressed in terms of atomic mass units and appropriate constants.

Wait, the thermal wavelength λ is given by λ = h / sqrt(2 π m k T). But m here is in kg. Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to express this using the molar mass in g/mol.

Wait, I think another version of the formula, when V is in cm³, T in K, and M is the molar mass in g/mol, is:

q_trans = ( (2.319e-24) * V * (T)^(3/2) * sqrt(M) ) )

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

q_trans = (2.319e-24) * V * (T)^(3/2) * sqrt(M) )

But I'm not entirely confident. Let me check the units to see if this makes sense.

Alternatively, I think the formula for the translational partition function can be written as:

q_trans = (V / (λ^3)) * (2 π m k T / h² )^(3/2)

Wait, perhaps I should look for an expression that combines all the constants into a single factor when using specific units.

Wait, I found a source that says the translational partition function can be calculated using:

q_trans = ( (2 π m k T V )^(3/2) ) / h^3

But substituting m = M/(N_A * 1000), since M is in g/mol (so kg/mol is M/1000).

Wait, M is in g/mol, so m = M * 1e-3 kg/mol / N_A.

So m = M/(1000 * N_A).

So let's plug that into the formula.

q_trans = [ (2 π (M/(1000 N_A)) k T )^(3/2) * V ] / h^3

But let me compute this expression. Let's group the constants together:

Let me compute the constants first.

Compute 2 π / (1000 N_A)^(3/2). Wait, wait, perhaps better to compute all the constants as a single factor.

The formula can be rewritten as:

q_trans = V * (2 π k T )^(3/2) * (M)^(3/2) / ( (1000 N_A)^(3/2) h^3 )

Let me compute the constants (2 π k T )^(3/2) divided by (1000 N_A)^(3/2) h^3.

Compute 2 π k T: 2 * π * 1.38e-23 J/K * 298 K.

2 π ≈ 6.2832.

6.2832 * 1.38e-23 = approx 8.68e-23.

Multiply by T=298: 8.68e-23 * 298 ≈ 2.59e-20.

So (2 π k T) = 2.59e-20 J.

Now, (2 π k T)^(3/2) = (2.59e-20)^(3/2).

Compute sqrt(2.59e-20) = approx 5.09e-10.

Then (2.59e-20) * (5.09e-10) = approx 1.32e-29.

So (2 π k T )^(3/2) ≈ 1.32e-29 J^(3/2).

Now, the denominator is (1000 N_A)^(3/2) h^3.

Compute (1000 N_A)^(3/2): 1000 is 1e3, so (1e3 * 6.022e23 )^(3/2) = (6.022e26 )^(3/2).

Wait, 6.022e26^(3/2) = (6.022)^(3/2) * (1e26)^(3/2).

(1e26)^(3/2) = 1e39.

(6.022)^(3/2) is approx sqrt(6.022) is ~2.455, so 6.022 * 2.455 ≈ 14.8.

So (6.022e26)^(3/2) ≈ 14.8e39 = 1.48e40.

Now, h^3 is (6.626e-34)^3 ≈ 2.90e-101 J^3 s^3.

Wait, but the denominator is (1000 N_A)^(3/2) * h^3, so that's 1.48e40 * 2.90e-101 = approx 4.29e-61.

So the constants together are numerator (1.32e-29) divided by denominator (4.29e-61) → 1.32e-29 / 4.29e-61 = approx 3.08e31.

So the entire constant factor is 3.08e31.

So q_trans = V * sqrt(M) * 3.08e31.

Because M is raised to the 3/2 power: (M)^(3/2) = M * sqrt(M).

Wait, no, wait: The M term comes from the m in the original formula. Since m = M/(1000 N_A), and (m)^(3/2) is part of the term. So the formula includes (M)^(3/2).

Wait, perhaps it's better to express the entire equation correctly. Let me reorganize:

q_trans = V * (2 π m k T )^(3/2) / h^3.

But m = M/(1000 N_A).

So,

q_trans = V * (2 π (M/(1000 N_A)) k T )^(3/2) / h^3.

Which can be written as:

q_trans = V * (2 π k T)^(3/2) * (M/(1000 N_A))^(3/2
