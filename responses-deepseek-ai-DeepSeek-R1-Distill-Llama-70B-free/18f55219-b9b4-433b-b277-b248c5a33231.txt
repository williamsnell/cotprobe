Okay, so I have this problem here about Bob Gafney and Susan Medina investing money in a luncheonette. They each put in different amounts, and they have a specific way of dividing the net income. I need to figure out how the $28,600 net income is split between them. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, let me list out the given information. Bob invested $40,000 and Susan $50,000. Bob is the manager, so he gets 4% of the net income. Both of them also get 6% interest on their respective investments. The remaining income is split equally between them.

So, the net income is $28,600. Let me calculate each part.

First part: Bob gets 4% of net income. 4% of 28,600. Let me compute that. 0.04 * 28600 = 1,144. So Bob gets $1,144 from that.

Next, each partner gets 6% interest on their investment. So for Bob, 6% of 40,000 is 0.06 * 40000 = $2,400. For Susan, it's 6% of 50,000, which is 0.06 *50000 = $3,000. So that's another $2,400 for Bob and $3,000 for Susan.

Adding those up, so far Bob has 1,144 + 2,400 = $3,544. Susan has $3,000 from her interest.

Wait, but the question is about the division of the net income, so I think these are the initial amounts each gets before splitting the remainder. So total so far is 3,544 (Bob) + 3,000 (Susan) = $6,544. But wait, the net income is 28,600, which is much higher. So the remaining amount after these initial payments is split equally.

Wait, no, perhaps the initial 4% and the 6% interests are part of the total. Let me think again.

Wait, the total net income is $28,600. From this, Bob takes 4% as his management fee. Then, each gets 6% on their investment as interest. The rest is split equally.

So the process is:

1. Calculate Bob's 4% management fee: 0.04 * 28600 = 1,144.

2. Calculate the interest for each: Bob gets 6% on his 40k: 0.06*40000=2,400. Susan gets 0.06*50000=3,000.

3. Then, subtract these amounts from the net income to see what's left to split. Wait, no, because the net income is the total. So perhaps the order is: subtract the management fee first, then subtract the interest payments, and the remaining is split equally.

Wait, but let me think again. The question says, "each partner receives 6% interest on his or her investment. Any remaining net income is divided equally."

So the steps should be:

- From the net income, first, Bob gets 4% as his management fee.

- Then, each gets their 6% interest on investment.

- The remaining amount after these two steps is split equally between them.

Wait, but is that correct? Or is the management fee part of the net income, and then the interest and split happen from what's left after the fee?

Let me clarify. The net income is $28,600. Bob gets 4% of that as his fee. Then, from the remaining, each gets 6% interest on their investment. Wait, no, the problem says each receives 6% interest on their investment, regardless of the net income. So perhaps the 6% interest is calculated based on their initial investment, not the net income.

Wait, the problem states: "each partner receives 6% interest on his or her investment." So that's separate from the net income. So the 6% is calculated on their initial investment, not on the net income.

So, the process is:

1. Management fee: Bob gets 4% of net income (28,600) = 1,144.

2. Interest payments: Bob gets 6% of 40k = 2,400; Susan gets 6% of 50k = 3,000.

3. The remaining net income is split equally.

So, let's calculate the total taken out before the split.

Total taken by Bob: 1,144 + 2,400 = 3,544.

Total taken by Susan: 3,000.

Total taken so far: 3,544 + 3,000 = 6,544.

Net income is 28,600, so remaining is 28,600 - 6,544 = 22,056.

This remaining 22,056 is split equally, so each gets half.

Half of 22,056 is 11,028. So Bob gets 11,028 and Susan gets 11,028 from the remaining.

Now, let's sum up each person's total.

Bob's total:

Management fee: 1,144

Interest: 2,400

Split: 11,028

Total = 1,144 + 2,400 = 3,544 + 11,028 = 14,572.

Susan's total:

Interest: 3,000

Split: 11,028

Total = 3,000 + 11,028 = 14,028.

Wait, but let me check the options. The options give the totals for each. So Bob's total is 14,572, Susan's is 14,028.

Looking at the options:

Option C: Mr.Gafney's income is $14,572 and Ms. Medina's income is $15,028. No, that's not matching.

Wait, option F says Mr. Gafney: 14,572 and Ms. Medina: 14,028. That's exactly what I got.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Management fee: 4% of 28,600 is 1,144. Correct.

Interest:

Bob: 6% of 40k: 2,400.

Susan: 6% of 50k: 3,000.

So, total taken by Bob: 1,144 + 2,400 = 3,544.

Total taken by Susan: 3,000.

Total taken: 6,544.

Remaining: 28,600 - 6,544 = 22,056.

Split equally: 11,028 each.

Adding to each:

Bob: 3,544 + 11,028 = 14,572.

Susan: 3,000 + 11,028 = 14,028.

Yes, that's correct.

Looking back at the options, option F matches this: Mr. Gafney gets $14,572 and Ms. Medina $14,028.

So the correct answer should be F.

To determine how the net income of $28,600 is divided between Bob Gafney and Susan Medina, we follow these steps:

1. **Management Fee**: Bob receives 4% of the net income as a management fee.  
   \[
   0.04 \times 28,600 = 1,144
   \]

2. **Interest on Investments**: Each partner receives 6% interest on their respective investments.  
   - Bob's interest:  
     \[
     0.06 \times 40,000 = 2,400
     \]
   - Susan's interest:  
     \[
     0.06 \times 50,000 = 3,000
     \]

3. **Total Initial Payments**:  
   - Bob: \(1,144 + 2,400 = 3,544\)  
   - Susan: \(3,000\)  
   - Combined: \(3,544 + 3,000 = 6,544\)

4. **Remaining Net Income**:  
   \[
   28,600 - 6,544 = 22,056
   \]

5. **Equal Split of Remaining Income**:  
   Each partner receives half of the remaining $22,056:  
   \[
   \frac{22,056}{2} = 11,028
   \]

6. **Final Totals**:  
   - Bob's total income:  
     \[
     1,144 + 2,400 + 11,028 = 14,572
     \]
   - Susan's total income:  
     \[
     3,000 + 11,028 = 14,028
     \]

Thus, Bob Gafney receives $14,572, and Susan Medina receives $14,028. Comparing this to the options, the correct answer is **F**.
