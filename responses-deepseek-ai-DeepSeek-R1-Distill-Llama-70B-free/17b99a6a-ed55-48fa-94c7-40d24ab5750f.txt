Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question in front of me about conflicts between a congressional act and a valid treaty. Hmm, I need to figure out how such a conflict is resolved. I'm a bit rusty on my constitutional law, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that the Constitution addresses the hierarchy of laws. Article VI, the Supremacy Clause, says that the Constitution is the highest law of the land. It also mentions that treaties, along with federal statutes and the Constitution, are part of the "supreme Law of the Land." But wait, what happens when a treaty and a congressional act clash?

I think the Supremacy Clause might come into play here. Treaties are made under the authority of the federal government, typically negotiated by the executive branch and ratified by the Senate. Congressional acts are passed by Congress. So both have federal authority, but which one takes precedence when they conflict.

I remember something about the "last in time" rule. The idea is that whichever was enacted later in time would take precedence. So if a treaty was made first and then Congress passes a conflicting law, the later-enacted law would override the treaty. Conversely, if Congress passes a law and then a treaty that conflicts with it, the treaty would take precedence because it's later. 

Wait, but is that accurate? Or does it depend on other factors? I think there's a Supreme Court case that addressed this. Oh right, in the case of McCulloch v. Maryland, the Court discussed the supremacy of federal law, but that was more about states versus federal. Another case I'm trying to recall, maybe Whitney v. Robertson or the case where a treaty and a statute conflicted. 

Whitney v. Robertson (1888) involved a conflict between a treaty with Spain about Cuban bounties and a later congressional act that modified those bounties. The Supreme Court held that the later congressional act took precedence over the earlier treaty. So the "last in time" approach applies.

So the rule is that if a treaty and a federal statute conflict, the one that was enacted later in time is the one that prevails. Therefore, in the question, if there's a conflict, whichever came later would win. Looking at the options, option H says "The last in time prevails," which matches this understanding.

Wait, but let me make sure. Are there any exceptions or other considerations? For example, if the treaty was self-executing versus non-self-executing. Oh, but the question specifies a "valid treaty," so I think that's a given, and the analysis would still apply.

So the answer should be H: The last in time prevails.

The correct answer is determined by the principle that when a congressional act and a valid treaty conflict, the one enacted later in time takes precedence. This is known as the "last in time" rule, supported by case law such as Whitney v. Robertson. 

Answer: H
