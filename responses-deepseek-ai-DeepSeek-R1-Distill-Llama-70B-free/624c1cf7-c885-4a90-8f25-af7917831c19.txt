Okay, so I have this problem about determining the least permissible key length and the key length when the key and shaft are the same material. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think through it step by step.

First, I remember that keys are used in machinery to connect pulleys or gears to shafts, ensuring that the torque is transmitted properly. The key is usually fitted into a keyseat on the shaft and a keyway on the hub. The problem gives some specific details: the pulley has a hub length of 3.5 inches, delivers a torque of 1250 lb-ft, and the shaft is 2.5 inches in diameter.

The materials are given too. The pulley is made of ASTM 25 gray cast iron, the shaft is AISI 1020 steel (cold drawn), and the key is made of hot rolled 1010 steel. Oh wait, but part (b) considers the key and shaft as the same material. So for part (b), both are 1020 steel.

I think the approach here is to calculate the required length of the key based on the shear stress and the bearing stress, ensuring that neither the key nor the shaft fails under the given torque.

Let me outline the steps:

1. **Calculate the torque transmitted.** Wait, we have the torque already as 1250 lb-ft. But I might need to convert that to inch-pounds because stress formulas are in pounds per square inch (psi). Oh wait, 1 foot is 12 inches, so 1250 lb-ft is 1250 * 12 = 15,000 lb-in.

2. **Determine the polar moment of inertia for the shaft.** Wait, or is it something else? Maybe not. Alternatively, for a key, the torque is transmitted through shear in the key and bearing on the sides. So the key's length and the shaft diameter are important.

Wait, the key is a rectangular part, so the shear area would be the length of the key (L) multiplied by the width (which is the key's depth). But I think the key's dimensions are related to the shaft diameter. The shaft is 2.5 inches in diameter, so the key must fit into the keyseat. I remember that the key's width is typically a fraction of the shaft diameter. Oh, right, the key is usually a certain size relative to the shaft. For example, for a shaft of diameter D, the key might have a width of D/4 or something like that. Alternatively, there are standard key sizes, but maybe I should look up the formula.

Wait, I think the key is designed based on the allowable shear stress and bearing stress. The shear stress in the key shouldn't exceed the material's allowable, and the same for the bearing stress on the shaft.

So, for the shear stress in the key: The torque T is equal to the shear force multiplied by the distance from the center. But wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The key is in shear. The torque is transmitted by the key, which is in double shear (because the key is between the shaft and the hub, so both sides of the key are sheared). Wait, no, maybe it's the bearing area that's important, or perhaps the shear. I think the key is subject to both shear and bearing stresses.

Wait, let's clarify. The key is usually designed so that it fails in shear before it fails in bearing. Alternatively, the bearing strength of the shaft material is considered. So perhaps the allowable stress is determined for both the key and the shaft, and the key length is set such that neither exceeds their respective allowable stresses.

The key length L must be such that the maximum shear stress in the key and the bearing stress on the shaft are within their allowable limits.

So, let's get the formulas:

- Shear stress in the key (τ): τ = (Torque) / (Shear area)
Shear area for the key would be 2 * (L * w), where w is the width of the key. Wait, because the key has two shear planes, so the area is twice the product of length and width.

Wait, no, wait. The key is a rectangular bar. When it's transmitting torque, the shear stress is calculated as the torque divided by the polar moment of inertia of the key's cross-section. Wait, no, that's for torsion. But the key is in direct shear, not torsion. Because the key is essentially a beam in shear when the torque is applied.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. The torque T is equal to the shear force F multiplied by the radius at which it's applied. But I'm not sure that's the right approach here.

Alternatively, the torque T causes a shearing force on the key. The key has a cross-sectional area A, and the shear stress τ must not exceed the allowable τ_allow for the key material.

So, shear stress τ = T / (A * n), where n is the number of shear planes. Wait, but I'm not entirely certain about this.

Alternatively, for a rectangular key in double shear, the shear area is 2 * (length * width), because there are two planes where the shearing occurs.

Wait, let's look up. Oh wait, I can't look up, but I have to think.

I think the formula is: T = τ * A * d/2, where d is the diameter of the shaft. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, I recall that the shear stress in a key is T/(L * h), where h is the height (or width) of the key. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, maybe the torque is related to the product of the shear stress, the length of the key, and the width squared. Wait, perhaps I should derive the formula.

Let me think about the key as a rectangular bar of length L and width w (height). The torque T is applied, causing shear in the key. The shear stress τ is given by T divided by the shear area. But for a rectangular key, the shear area would be the area of the two ends, so 2 * (L * w). Because the key is in double shear.

Wait, no, in double shear, each end has an area of L * w, so the total shear area is 2 L w. So, the shear stress would be T/(2 L w).

But wait, the torque is also related to the bending moment, but perhaps in this case, the key is designed in shear.

Wait, another approach: the key must transmit the torque without failing. So, the shear stress in the key is τ = T / (shear area). The shear area is 2 * L * w, because there are two shear planes (double shear).

So, τ = T / (2 * L * w)

Similarly, the bearing stress on the shaft is σ = T / (L * d), where d is the diameter of the shaft. Because the bearing area is L * d (the length of the key times the diameter of the shaft).

Wait, that sounds familiar. So, the bearing stress is T divided by (L * d). But wait, no, let me think again. The torque T is equal to the force F times the radius r, where r is d/2. So, F = T / r = (2 T) / d.

The force F is the tangential force acting on the key, which is distributed over the area L * w (length times width) of the key. Wait, no, the force F is the force exerted on the key, so the bearing stress would be F divided by (L * w). But I'm getting a bit tangled.

Wait, perhaps it's better to approach it using the two possible failure modes: shear of the key and bearing on the shaft.

Shear failure of the key: The key will fail if the shear stress exceeds the allowable for the key's material.

Bearing failure of the shaft: The shaft will fail if the bearing stress (contact stress between the key and the shaft) exceeds the allowable for the shaft's material.

So, we need to calculate both and ensure that neither exceeds their respective allowable stresses.

Let's get the materials' properties.

The key is made of hot rolled 1010 steel. I think 1010 steel has a certain ultimate tensile strength. Let me try to remember or think about standard properties. 1010 is a mild steel, maybe around 40,000 psi tensile strength? But wait, I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the allowable stresses are given in some standard values. Wait, for SAE 1010 hot rolled, the yield strength is around 30,000 to 40,000 psi. Let me assume that the allowable shear stress for the key is half of the tensile strength. So if the tensile strength is 40,000 psi, then the allowable shear stress τ_allow_key would be 20,000 psi.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, sometimes the allowable shear stress is taken as 0.4 times the ultimate tensile strength. So if 1010 has a UTS of 50,000 psi, τ_allow would be 0.4*50,000 = 20,000 psi.

Alternatively, perhaps for moderate shock, the allowable shear stress is given as 6000 psi for 1010 steel. Hmm, not sure. Maybe I should recall that for cold-drawn 1020, the UTS is around 65,000 psi, so shear would be about 30,000 psi. But the key is 1010 hot rolled, which is lower. Maybe 1010 HR has a UTS around 50,000 psi, so shear allowable 20,000 psi.

Alternatively, perhaps for gray cast iron, which is the pulley material, the allowable is different, but in this problem, the pulley isn't part of the key or shaft, so maybe it's just the key and shaft that matter.

Wait, no. The pulley's material is given, but the key and shaft are different materials. So the hub is cast iron, but the key is 1010 HR, and the shaft is 1020 CD.

So, for the key, we have 1010 HR. Let me look up typical allowable shear stresses. But since I can't, I'll have to make educated guesses.

Assuming that 1010 HR has a shear strength of about 20,000 psi. Then, the shaft is 1020 CD, which is stronger. Let's say the shaft's allowable bearing stress is 30,000 psi.

Wait, but let's think in terms of the problem. For part (a), we have the key made of 1010, shaft of 1020. For part (b), key and shaft are both 1020.

So, let's get back to the formulas.

Shear stress in the key: τ = T / (2 * L * w)

Bearing stress on the shaft: σ = T / (L * d)

We need to find L such that both τ ≤ τ_allow_key and σ ≤ σ_allow_shaft.

But wait, we have two equations, so we can compute L for each condition, and the required key length will be the larger of the two.

Additionally, the width of the key w depends on the shaft diameter. For a shaft of diameter D, the key's width is usually something like D/4 or D/5. Wait, I think it's D/4 for standard keys. So, for a 2.5-inch diameter shaft, the key width w is 2.5 / 4 = 0.625 inches.

Wait, but another way is that the key width is 1/4 inch per inch of diameter, so 2.5 * 0.25 = 0.625 inches. So, w = 0.625 in.

Alternatively, perhaps it's based on the keyseat depth, but I think the width is proportional to the shaft diameter.

So, w = 0.625 inches.

Now, let's compute the required L for each condition.

First, calculate the torque T in inch-pounds: 1250 lb-ft * 12 in/ft = 15,000 in-lb.

Now, for the shear stress in the key:

τ = T / (2 * L * w) = 15000 / (2 * L * 0.625) = 15000 / (1.25 L) = 12000 / L.

This must be ≤ τ_allow_key.

Assuming τ_allow_key is 20,000 psi:

12000 / L ≤ 20000 → L ≥ 12000 / 20000 → L ≥ 0.6 inches.

Wait, that seems too small, but perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the key's shear strength is lower than the shaft's bearing strength, so the shaft's bearing condition would govern.

Now, for the bearing stress on the shaft:

σ = T / (L * d) = 15000 / (L * 2.5) = 6000 / L.

This must be ≤ σ_allow_shaft.

Assuming σ_allow_shaft is 30,000 psi:

6000 / L ≤ 30000 → L ≥ 6000 / 30000 → L ≥ 0.2 inches.

Wait, that can't be right. Both conditions give very small L, but the options are all around 1.5 to 4 inches. So, I must have made a mistake in the formulas.

Wait, perhaps I got the formulas wrong. Let me think again.

I think another way is that the key is in double shear, so the shear area is 2 * (L * w). So, T = τ * (2 L w). So, τ = T / (2 L w).

Similarly, the bearing area is L * d, so σ = T / (L d).

Wait, that's what I did before, but let me double-check the numbers.

Wait, perhaps the allowable stresses are different. Let me check what typical allowable stresses are for these materials.

For 1010 HR (key), the ultimate tensile strength is about 50,000 psi. So, allowable shear stress τ_allow would be 0.5 * UTS = 25,000 psi.

Wait, but sometimes allowable shear is taken as 0.4 * UTS, so 20,000 psi.

For the shaft, 1020 CD steel has higher strength. Its UTS is around 65,000 psi. So, allowable bearing stress σ_allow would be, say, 30,000 psi.

Wait, but bearing stress is compressive. For steels, the allowable bearing stress can be higher. Maybe up to 0.6 * UTS, so 0.6 * 65,000 = 39,000 psi.

Wait, but perhaps for bearing, the allowable is calculated differently. Maybe it's based on the compressive yield strength.

Alternatively, perhaps I should refer to the ASME codes or standard machine design practices, but since I can't, I'll proceed with the assumptions.

So, using τ_allow_key = 20,000 psi and σ_allow_shaft = 30,000 psi.

Now, let's compute L for each condition.

Shear stress condition:

τ = T / (2 L w) = 15000 / (2 * L * 0.625) = 15000 / (1.25 L) = 12000 / L.

Set this equal to 20,000:

12000 / L = 20000 → L = 12000 / 20000 = 0.6 inches.

Bearing stress condition:

σ = T / (L * d) = 15000 / (L * 2.5) = 6000 / L.

Set equal to 30,000:

6000 / L = 30000 → L = 6000 / 30000 = 0.2 inches.

Wait, but this suggests that the minimum L is 0.6 inches, which is way below the options given. So I must have messed up something.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the torque value. The torque given is 1250 lb-ft, which is 1250 * 12 = 15,000 in-lb. That part seems correct.

Wait, perhaps the width of the key is larger. Maybe I assumed the width incorrectly. Let me think again. For a 2.5-inch diameter shaft, the key's width is typically 0.25 * diameter, so 0.625 inches. But perhaps that's not correct. Maybe it's a standard key size. 

Wait, in machinery's handbook, for a 2.5-inch shaft, the key might be a 1/4 inch by 1 inch, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the key width is 1/4 inch, but that would make w=0.25 in.

Wait, but I'm getting confused. Let me try to think of another approach. Maybe the key's dimensions are such that w is 1/4 inch, but perhaps for a 2.5-inch shaft, the key is 0.25 inches wide and 0.5 inches thick. Hmm, I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the key's dimensions are such that the width is 0.25 inches, but I'm not sure. If I use w=0.25, then:

Shear stress condition:

τ = 15000 / (2 * L * 0.25) = 15000 / (0.5 L) = 30,000 / L.

Set to 20,000: 30,000 / L = 20,000 → L = 30,000 / 20,000 = 1.5 inches.

Bearing stress condition:

σ = 15000 / (L * 2.5) = 6000 / L.

Set to 30,000: 6000 / L = 30,000 → L = 6000 / 30,000 = 0.2 inches.

So the governing condition is L = 1.5 inches.

But the options don't have part (a) as 1.5 inches. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, option G has (a) as 1.5, and (b) as 3.0. Option D has (a) 1.5 and (b) 4.0. Option H has (a) 1.0 and (b) 3.0.

But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the allowable stresses. Let me think again. Maybe for the key, the allowable shear stress is lower.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the shaft is made of 1020 CD, which has higher strength, so the bearing condition will require a longer key.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the minimum L based on both conditions, taking the maximum of the two Ls from shear and bearing.

In this case, with w=0.625 inches:

Shear condition L = 0.6 in.

Bearing condition L = 0.2 in.

So, the minimum L is 0.6 inches, but the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the width.

Wait, perhaps the key's width is the same as the shaft's diameter over something else. Maybe the key's width is
