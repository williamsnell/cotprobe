Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this criminal law question. Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

So, there's a mother who hates a girl because she outperforms her daughter, making her feel inferior. The mother is worried that this girl will take the last cheerleading spot, so she decides to kill her. One night, she and her boyfriend are having dinner. She asks him to kill the girl, gives him a gun, and the girl's home address. But she actually gives him the wrong address. 

Unbeknownst to the boyfriend, he goes to the wrong house across the street. He rings the doorbell, a woman answers. He asks if her daughter is home. The woman calls her daughter, and when she comes, the boyfriend shoots and kills both the woman and her daughter.

The question is, what crimes is the mother guilty of? The options are from A to J, each listing different combinations.

Alright, let's break this down step by step. I need to figure out which crimes the mother is liable for. Let's think about the possible charges: conspiracy, solicitation, murder, attempted murder, manslaughter, etc.

First, the mother asked her boyfriend to kill someone. So, she's trying to get someone to commit a crime. That sounds like solicitation. Solicitation is when you entice or induce someone else to commit a crime. So yes, she's guilty of solicitation.

Next, she and her boyfriend were acting together. She gave him the gun and the address. So they had an agreement to commit this crime. That makes conspiracy. Conspiracy is an agreement between two or more people to commit a crime, with the intent to achieve that goal. So she's part of a conspiracy.

Now, the intended target was the girl, but the boyfriend went to the wrong house and killed two people. So the mother didn't intend to kill those two people, but she did intend to kill the girl. However, the boyfriend did kill two people, so how does that affect the mother's liability?

In terms of murder, under common law, if someone dies as a result of a conspiracy, all conspirators are liable. But wait, the boyfriend went to the wrong address. So the mother's intent was to kill the girl, not the woman and her daughter across the street. However, under the felony murder rule, if a death occurs during the commission of a felony, the conspirators can be held liable. But wait, the felony would be the conspiracy here, perhaps.

Alternatively, there's the concept of transferred intent. If you intend to kill one person but end up killing another, the intent transfers, and you can be guilty of murder. But in this case, the mother didn't pull the trigger; she had someone else do it. So does transferred intent apply to her through the boyfriend's actions?

Wait, no. The mother's intent was to have the boyfriend kill the girl. But he killed two other people. So, the mother didn't intend those deaths, so transferred intent might not apply directly to her. But, under the theory of vicarious liability in conspiracy, any death that occurs in furtherance of the conspiracy's objective can make all conspirators guilty.

Alternatively, the initial plan was to kill a specific person, but the boyfriend's mistake led to different victims. So, the mother can be guilty of murder for these deaths because the killing was in furtherance of their conspiracy. So, she's guilty of two counts of murder.

Wait, but the problem is that the mother didn't intend to kill those specific people. She intended to kill the girl, but the boyfriend killed others. So, would she be guilty of murdering them?

I think the answer lies in the concept of "depraved heart murder," but that's usually when the killer acts with a disregard for human life, leading to death. Here, she intended to kill, so maybe it's more about transferred intent or conspiracy liability.

Wait, another angle: when you conspire to commit a murder, you're liable for any deaths that occur as a result of the conspiracy, even if unintended. So, because she and her boyfriend agreed to commit the murder of the girl, and in attempting to carry it out, he killed two others, she can be held liable for their murders as part of the conspiracy.

So, she's guilty of conspiracy to commit murder. Then, for the actual killings, since the boyfriend was acting in furtherance of the conspiracy, she's guilty of murder for both deaths.

But wait, the initial plan was to kill one person, so does that mean she's guilty of two counts of murder? Or is it a single count with two victims?

Each victim would count as a separate murder charge. So two counts of murder.

Additionally, she's guilty of conspiracy. Now, what about attempted murder? The intended target was the girl, but she wasn't killed. Did the mother attempt to have the girl killed? Well, the boyfriend went to the wrong house, but he intended to kill the girl based on the mother's instructions. So, is the mother guilty of attempted murder for the girl?

Wait, the boyfriend actually killed two people, but he also intended to kill the girl. So, in terms of the girl, he didn't actually kill her, but he attempted to, perhaps. So, the mother could be guilty of attempted murder towards the girl, and murder for the two who were killed.

Wait, but the mother's intent was to have the girl killed. So she's guilty of solicitation and conspiracy to commit that murder. But the boyfriend didn't actually attempt the girl's murder because he went to the wrong house. So, did he take a substantial step towards killing the girl? Or did he take steps that he thought would kill her, but were ineffective?

Hmm. For attempt, you need a specific intent to commit the crime and a substantial step towards its commission. The boyfriend took the gun, went to the address, and tried to kill someone. He thought he was killing the girl, but he was at the wrong house. So, the attempt was directed at the girl, but he didn't actually attempt her because he wasn't there. So, perhaps the mother is guilty of attempted murder because the boyfriend took substantial steps but failed due to a mistake.

Wait, but the mother's liability for attempt would depend on whether an attempt was made. The boyfriend intended to kill the girl, so when he went to the wrong house and tried to kill someone else, does that count as an attempt towards the girl? I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps she's guilty of attempted murder because she took steps (soliciting her boyfriend) to kill the girl, even if the attempt didn't reach the intended target. So, the attempt is towards the girl, and the actual killings of the other two are separate.

So, putting it together: the mother is guilty of conspiracy to commit murder, solicitation to commit murder, attempted murder (for the intended girl), and two counts of murder (for the two victims who were killed).

Wait, but looking at the options, let's check which ones match. Option C: Conspiracy, attempted murder, and two counts of murder. Option H: Solicitation, attempted murder, and two counts of murder.

Wait, the initial part: the mother asked her boyfriend to kill the girl. So that's solicitation. She also entered into a conspiracy with him, as they agreed to commit the murder.

So, she's guilty of both conspiracy and solicitation. But looking at the options, let's see:

Option C: Conspiracy, attempted murder, and two counts of murder.

Option H: Solicitation, attempted murder, and two counts of murder.

Wait, but if she is guilty of both conspiracy and solicitation, but none of the options include both. So I need to figure out which applies.

Solicitation is the act of asking someone to commit a crime. Conspiracy is when two or more agree to commit a crime. So, in this case, the mother both solicited her boyfriend and entered into a conspiracy with him.

But in some jurisdictions, when a conspiracy is formed, the act of solicitation is part of the conspiracy. So, maybe she's guilty of conspiracy, which encompasses the solicitation. But some might treat them as separate crimes.

Looking at the options, option C includes conspiracy but not solicitation, and option H includes solicitation but not conspiracy.

Wait, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think again.

The mother asked her boyfriend to kill the girl. That's solicitation (a crime in itself). Then, she and the boyfriend formed an agreement, so that's conspiracy. So, she is guilty of both.

But looking at the answer options, none of the options have both conspiracy and solicitation. So perhaps the correct approach is that conspiracy subsumes solicitation, or perhaps the question treats them as separate.

Alternatively, maybe the question is testing on whether the mother is guilty of conspiracy, attempt, and murder, or just some of them.

Wait, another angle: the boyfriend went to the wrong address and killed two people. So, the original plan was to kill one, but he killed two. So, the mother can be guilty of two counts of murder because those deaths occurred during the commission of the intended crime (murder of the girl). So, under the felony murder rule, or as part of the conspiracy, she is liable for those deaths.

Additionally, she is guilty of attempted murder for the intended victim, the girl, because the boyfriend took steps to kill her but didn't succeed. So, attempted murder.

Wait, but if the boyfriend didn't actually attempt to kill the girl because he went to the wrong house, is the mother guilty of attempted murder? Because the attempt was directed at the wrong person. So, perhaps she is guilty of attempted murder because the intent was there, and the boyfriend took steps towards it, even if unsuccessful.

So, the mother's crimes would be: conspiracy to commit murder, attempted murder (of the girl), and two counts of murder (for the two victims killed).

Looking at the options:

Option C: Conspiracy, attempted murder, and two counts of murder.

Option H: Solicitation, attempted murder, and two counts of murder.

Wait, so if the options don't include both conspiracy and solicitation, which one is correct?

Alternatively, perhaps the correct charges are solicitation and conspiracy. But the options don't have that.

Wait, let's think about the elements. Conspiracy requires an agreement and intent. Solicitation is the act of asking. So, the mother both solicited and conspired. But in the options, the possible answers have either conspiracy or solicitation, not both.

But looking at the options, option C says conspiracy, attempted murder, and two counts of murder. Option H says solicitation, attempted murder, and two counts of murder.

So, which is correct? Because the mother did both.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is H because she's guilty of solicitation (asking the boyfriend to kill), attempted murder (for the intended girl), and two counts of murder for the actual deaths.

But wait, the mother agreed with the boyfriend to commit the murder, which is conspiracy. So she's guilty of conspiracy, not just solicitation. So maybe option C is better.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is that she's guilty of conspiracy, attempted murder, and two counts of murder. So that would be option C. But I'm a bit confused because she did solicit him, but perhaps the conspiracy charge includes that.

Alternatively, some jurisdictions may merge solicitation into conspiracy if the solicitation leads to an agreement. So, perhaps the correct answer is C, which includes conspiracy, attempted murder, and two murders.

But let's double-check.

In the scenario, the mother and the boyfriend had an agreement to kill the girl. So that's conspiracy. The mother is guilty of conspiracy. She also asked him to do it, which is solicitation, but perhaps in this case, the conspiracy charge would include the solicitation. Or perhaps they are separate charges.

But the options don't have both, so I have to choose between C and H.

Wait, the mother gave him the gun and the address, which is aiding and abetting, but perhaps that's part of the conspiracy.

Alternatively, let's think about the possible charges she faces:

1. Conspiracy to commit murder: yes.

2. Solicitation to commit murder: yes, because she asked him.

3. Attempted murder of the girl: because the boyfriend took steps towards killing her, but didn't succeed.

4. Murder of the two victims: because their deaths occurred in the course of the conspiracy.

So, she could be guilty of conspiracy, solicitation, attempted murder, and two counts of murder. But the options don't include that combination.

Looking at the options:

Option C: Conspiracy, attempted murder, and two counts of murder.

Option H: Solicitation, attempted murder, and two counts of murder.

So, which applies? Because she's guilty of both conspiracy and solicitation, but none of the options have both.

Wait, perhaps the question is testing on whether the mother is guilty as a principal for the murder, under the conspiracy. So, she's guilty of two counts of murder, conspiracy, and attempted murder.

But the options don't include conspiracy as a separate charge with attempted murder and two murders except for option C.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C: Conspiracy, attempted murder, and two counts of murder.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is H because she's guilty of solicitation, attempted murder, and the two murders.

But I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think again.

In terms of criminal liability, the mother is guilty of:

- Conspiracy to commit murder (agreed with boyfriend)

- Solicitation to commit murder (asked boyfriend to kill)

- Attempted murder of the girl (since steps were taken but the girl wasn't harmed)

- Murder of the two victims (because the conspiracy led to their deaths)

But the options don't include all these.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that the mother is guilty of conspiracy, attempted murder, and the two murders. So option C.

Alternatively, the solicitation charge might stand alone, but I think conspiracy would include the solicitation as part of it.

Wait, no. Solicitation is a separate crime. So she can be guilty of both. But since the options don't have both, perhaps the correct answer is H.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of the possible charges she can face. She can be charged with conspiracy, because she and the boyfriend agreed to commit the murder. She can be charged with solicitation, because she asked him to do it. She can be charged with attempted murder for the intended girl, because the boyfriend took substantial steps (even if unsuccessful). And she can be charged with the murders of the two victims because they died in the commission of the conspiracy's objective.

So, she has conspiracy, solicitation, attempted murder, and two counts of murder.

But looking at the options, none combine all these. So perhaps the correct answer is H: Solicitation, attempted murder, and two counts of murder. Because that's three charges, and the options don't include conspiracy.

Wait, but the options don't include both conspiracy and solicitation. So maybe the answer expects that she's guilty of conspiracy, attempted murder, and two counts of murder, which is option C.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H, considering that the conspiracy is not charged because the boyfriend didn't actually agree? Wait, no, the mother asked, and he went along, so there was an agreement.

Hmm. I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think of the possible charges step by step.

1. Solicitation: Yes, because she asked him to kill.

2. Conspiracy: Yes, because she and the boyfriend agreed to commit the murder.

3. Attempted Murder: Yes, because he took steps to kill the girl, even though he didn't succeed.

4. Murder: Yes, two counts because two people died.

So, she's guilty of all four, but the options don't have that. So I need to see which options include the most accurate.

Looking at the options again:

A: Conspiracy and voluntary manslaughter. No, because it's murder.

B: Solicitation, attempted murder, and one count of murder. No, because there are two victims.

C: Conspiracy, attempted murder, and two counts of murder. Yes, this fits.

D: Conspiracy, attempted murder, and voluntary manslaughter. No.

E: Solicitation and attempted murder. No, misses the murders.

F: Solicitation and two counts of murder. Misses attempted murder.

G: Solicitation, conspiracy, and voluntary manslaughter. No.

H: Solicitation, attempted murder, and two counts of murder. This also fits.

I: Conspiracy and two counts of murder. Misses attempted murder.

J: Conspiracy, voluntary manslaughter, and two counts of murder. No.

So, both options C and H fit, except C includes conspiracy and H includes solicitation.

Which is correct? Because the mother is guilty of both conspiracy and solicitation, but the options don't have both.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is H: Solicitation, attempted murder, and two counts of murder.

Because the mother is guilty of soliciting the boyfriend, which is a separate offense from conspiracy. But in reality, she's guilty of both. But since the options don't include both, I have to choose based on what's included.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C, because conspiracy includes the solicitation, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another angle: the mother is guilty of conspiracy because she and the boyfriend agreed to commit the murder. So, that's a separate charge. Then, the actual killings would be murder under the conspiracy. So, two counts of murder. Also, the attempt to kill the girl would be attempted murder. So, option C fits.

So, I think the answer is C: Conspiracy, attempted murder, and two counts of murder.

Wait, but the mother didn't attempt the murder herself; the boyfriend did. So, is she guilty of attempted murder? Because she solicited him, and he took steps, but didn't complete it.

Yes, because she's criminally responsible for his actions under the conspiracy. So, she's guilty of attempted murder as part of the conspiracy.

So, I think the correct answer is C.
</think>

The mother's actions and liability can be analyzed as follows:

1. **Solicitation**: The mother asked her boyfriend to kill the girl, which constitutes solicitation to commit murder.

2. **Conspiracy**: The mother and her boyfriend agreed to commit the murder, forming a conspiracy.

3. **Attempted Murder**: The boyfriend took substantial steps toward killing the girl (e.g., obtaining the gun and going to the address), but the attempt failed due to a mistake. The mother is liable for attempted murder as part of the conspiracy.

4. **Murder**: The boyfriend killed two people while acting in furtherance of the conspiracy. Under the doctrine of vicarious liability in conspiracy, the mother is guilty of two counts of murder for these deaths.

Given the options, the mother is guilty of **conspiracy**, **attempted murder**, and **two counts of murder**. While solicitation is also technically applicable, the conspiracy charge subsumes the solicitation in this context. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: Conspiracy, attempted murder, and two counts of murder.**

Answer: C
