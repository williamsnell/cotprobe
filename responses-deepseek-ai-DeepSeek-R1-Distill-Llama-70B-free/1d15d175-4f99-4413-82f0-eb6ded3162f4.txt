Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out. It's about titrating a weak base with a strong acid. Hmm, I remember that titrations involve neutralization reactions. Let me think through what happens in such a scenario.

Alright, the setup is that a weak base is being titrated with a standard strong acid. They're using a pH meter to track the progress. The question is about what observations would occur during this titration.

I recall that when you titrate a weak base with a strong acid, the equivalence point isn't at pH 7. Because the salt formed (from the weak base and strong acid) will be of a cation from the strong acid and the conjugate acid of the weak base. Wait, no, wait. The strong acid donates H+ ions, so the salt would be the conjugate acid of the weak base. Oh right. Since the base is weak, its conjugate acid is a weak acid. So the solution at equivalence point should be acidic. So the pH at equivalence point should be below 7.

Now, let's think about the titration curve. Initially, before any acid is added, the solution is a weak base. So the pH would be above 7. As you add the strong acid, which is H+ ions, it will react with the base. The weak base (let's say B) reacts with H+ to form BH+ (its conjugate acid). 

At the beginning, when you add a little acid, the pH drops quickly because the strong acid is a potent source of H+ ions. But since the base is weak, it can't buffer as effectively as a strong base would. Wait, no, actually, in the initial stages, the weak base is in excess. So the first addition of acid will react with the base. But since the base is weak, maybe the initial pH drop isn't as quick as with a strong base. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this mixed up.

Wait, no. When you start adding a strong acid to a weak base, the acid will donate H+ which will deprotonate the base. So the initial pH might not drop too rapidly because the base is absorbing the H+ ions. But wait, no, the base is weak, so it can't buffer as effectively? Or is that when you're adding a weak acid to a strong base?

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of buffer regions. When you add a strong acid (like HCl) to a weak base (like NH3), the NH3 will react with H+ to form NH4+. So before the equivalence point, you have a buffer solution of NH3 and NH4+. The pH during this buffer region will change relatively slowly as you add more strong acid because the buffer resists pH change.

At the start of the titration, the solution is mostly the weak base, so the pH is high. As you add strong acid, the buffer starts to form, and the pH decreases gradually. But wait, when you add strong acid to a weak base, the initial addition of acid (when the base is in excess) will cause a steep drop in pH. Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. For a weak base and strong acid titration, the pH at the beginning is high. Adding a small amount of strong acid causes a sharp decrease because the base is neutralized quickly. Once you pass the equivalence point, the excess strong acid causes the pH to drop sharply again. Wait, no, the equivalence point for weak base and strong acid is actually where you have the conjugate acid, so the pH is below 7.

Let me think about the shape of the titration curve. For a weak base titrated with a strong acid, the pH starts high. The initial addition of acid causes a steep drop in pH as the base is neutralized. Then, as you approach the equivalence point, the pH continues to drop but more gradually because you're in the buffer region. Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Or is the initial drop steep, then a more gradual change as it approaches the equivalence point?

Alternatively, maybe the initial pH doesn't change much until you get to the buffer region. No, I think when you first add strong acid to a weak base, the pH drops quickly because the acid is strong and donates H+ rapidly. Then, as more acid is added, you reach a point where the base is being consumed and the solution becomes a buffer of the weak base and its conjugate acid. So in that buffer region, the pH changes more slowly until you reach the equivalence point, where all the base has been neutralized. Beyond the equivalence point, excess strong acid causes the pH to drop sharply again.

Wait, but the question is about the observations during the titration. So initially, the pH would drop quickly because the strong acid is a strong source of H+. Then, as you add more acid, the pH continues to decrease but more gradually because you have the buffer system. At the equivalence point, the pH is below 7 because the solution contains the conjugate acid of the weak base.

Looking back at the options, I need to find which one matches this scenario.

Option A: Initially, pH quickly decreases, then gradual decrease to equivalence where pOH equals pKb. Hmm, equivalence point for a weak base and strong acid would have pH <7, and pOH would be equal to pKb plus something? Or maybe at equivalence, the solution is the conjugate acid, so pH would be based on the pKa of the conjugate acid. Wait, for a weak base, the salt is B H+ (conjugate acid), so pH is determined by the hydrolysis of BH+.

The pKa of BH+ is equal to 14 - pKb (since Kw = [BH+][OH-] and pKa + pKb =14). So at equivalence point, the pH is determined by the pKa of BH+. So the pH would be around pKa of the conjugate acid. But the option A says pOH equals pKb, which would mean pH = 14 - pKb, which is pKa. That would make sense because at equivalence, the solution is the conjugate acid, so [OH+] depends on pKa. So pOH is pKb. Wait, no, pKa (of BH+) is 14 - pKb. So pH at equivalence would be pKa, which is 14 - pKb. So pOH would be pKb. So option A says pOH equals pKb at equivalence, which would happen. But how about the trend?

Option A says the pH quickly decreases, then a gradual decrease. So perhaps the initial steep drop, then a more gradual one as it approaches equivalence.

Option B: pH quickly decrease, then gradual decrease to pH 7. But equivalence point is below 7, so B is wrong.

Option C: pH slowly increases, then rapid increase to pH>7. No, that doesn't fit. Because we're adding acid, the pH should decrease, not increase.

Option D: pH slowly decreases, then rapid increase to pH7. No, that's more like a weak acid titrated with strong base, where you have a sharp rise before equivalence.

Option E: pH gradually decreases throughout, equivalence pH>7. No, equivalence pH should be <7.

Option F: Initially, pH slowly decreases, then rapid decrease to pH7. No, equivalence is below 7.

Option G: pH increases throughout, equivalence pH>7. No, because we're adding acid.

Option H: Initially, pH slowly decreases, then rapid decrease to pH<7. Wait, initial slow decrease doesn't fit. I thought the initial addition causes a steep drop in pH. So initial would be a quick decrease, then gradual. H says initial slow.

Option I: pH quickly decrease, then gradual increase to equivalence where pOH=pKa. Wait, pKa is of the conjugate acid, but I don't know. This doesn't sound right.

Wait, the equivalence point for weak base and strong acid: solution contains the conjugate acid, so [OH+] is determined by the hydrolysis of the conjugate acid. So pH would be <7, and pOH would be >7.

Option A says at equivalence, pOH equals pKb of the base. Let's see, for the conjugate acid, pKa = 14 - pKb. So pH = pKa, which is 14 - pKb. Therefore, pOH would be pKb.

So option A's statement about equivalence is correct. Now, the initial part: initial pH quickly decreases, then a gradual decrease. That fits because the initial addition of strong acid causes a steep drop, then the buffer region (as more acid is added) leads to a more gradual decrease until equivalence.

So looking at the options, option A seems correct.

Wait, but in some titration curves I've seen, after adding a little acid, the pH drops rapidly because the weak base is neutralized. Then, as you approach the equivalence point, the solution becomes a buffer, so pH changes less rapidly. So the initial part is a steep drop, then a more gradual approach to the equivalence point.

So the initial pH drops quickly, and then continues to decrease, but more gradually until equivalence.

So the first part of option A fits: initially, pH quickly decreases, then a gradual decrease to the equivalence point where pOH=pKb.

So the correct answer is A.
</think>

When a weak base is titrated with a strong acid, the pH meter will track the progress of the reaction. Initially, the solution is a weak base, so the pH is above 7. As strong acid is added, it reacts with the weak base to form its conjugate acid (e.g., NH₃ + H⁺ → NH₄⁺). This initial reaction causes a steep drop in pH because the strong acid donates H⁺ ions rapidly.

As more acid is added, the solution enters a buffer region where both the weak base and its conjugate acid are present. In this region, the pH changes more gradually because the buffer resists large pH changes. Eventually, the equivalence point is reached, where all the weak base has been neutralized, and the solution contains only the conjugate acid of the weak base. At this point, the pH is determined by the hydrolysis of the conjugate acid, which is acidic, so the pH is below 7. Additionally, at the equivalence point, the pOH equals the pKb of the weak base because the conjugate acid's pKa is related to the base's pKb by the equation pKa + pKb = 14.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Correct. The pH initially decreases quickly as the strong acid reacts with the weak base, then decreases gradually in the buffer region, and at the equivalence point, the pOH equals the pKb of the base.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The equivalence point for a weak base and strong acid is below pH 7, not 7.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. The pH does not increase throughout the titration; it decreases as acid is added.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The pH does not rise rapidly near the equivalence point; it continues to decrease.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The pH does not decrease gradually throughout the experiment, and the equivalence point is below 7, not above 7.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The initial pH decrease is steep, not slow.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The pH does not increase throughout the experiment.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The initial pH decrease is steep, not slow.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The pH does not increase near the equivalence point.

Thus, the correct answer is **A**.
