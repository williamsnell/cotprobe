Okay, so I have this question about determining maturity dates for drafts, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question has four parts, a, b, c, d, each with different draft details. I need to find the maturity date for each and then match them to the options provided.

Let's start with part (a): A draft is dated November 12 and is payable 60 days after date. So, I need to calculate 60 days after November 12. Hmm, November has 30 days. So November 12 plus 60 days. Let's see: from Nov 12 to Nov 30 is 18 days left in November. So 60 -18 =42 days remaining. So adding 42 days to December. December has 31 days, so 31 days brings us to January 1 (since Dec 31 is day 31). Then 42-31=11 days into January. So January 11. Wait, but wait—wait, no, wait. Because adding 60 days to Nov 12: Nov 12 is the starting point. Let me recount:

November has 30 days. So from Nov 12 to Nov 30: that's 30-12 =18 days. So 18 days in November, then 60-18=42 days left. So December has 31 days, so 31 days brings us to Dec 31, which is 31 days, so adding those 42 days would be Dec 31 plus 11 days (because 42-31=11). So that's January 11. Wait, but the options have January 12 as an option. Did I make a mistake? Let me double-check. Oh wait, maybe I'm not counting correctly.

Wait, when you add days, do you include the starting date? For example, if you have a date and add a certain number of days, do you count the starting day as day 0 or day 1? Let me think: I think when a draft is payable after a certain number of days, the day after the date is day 1. So Nov 12 is day 0, then day 1 is Nov 13. So the calculation would be correct as 60 days after would be Nov 12 +60 days. Let me try a different approach using a calendar.

Starting from Nov 12: adding 60 days.

November: 12 to 30 is 19 days (including the 12th?), wait no, from the 12th, the days remaining in November are 30-12 =18 days. So 18 days in November, then 60-18=42 days left.

December: 31 days. So 31 days in December would take us to Dec 31, which is 31 days. So 42 days is Dec 31 plus 11 days into January. So that's January 11. But wait, some options have January 12, like option A and B and D and E.

Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating. Alternatively, perhaps I should count the date of the draft as day 0, and the next day as day 1. So for example, if the draft is dated Nov 12, then the 60 days after would start on Nov 13 as day 1. So let me recalculate.

60 days after Nov 12. So Nov 12 is day 0, Nov 13 is day 1. So 60 days later would be adding 60 days.

Alternatively, I can think of it as 60 days from Nov 12. Let me count the days. November has 30 days. From Nov 12 to Nov 30 is 19 days (including Nov 12? No, because if Nov 12 is day 0, then Nov 13 is day 1. So from Nov 12 to Nov 30 is 18 days. So 60 days minus 18 is 42 days remaining. So December has 31 days, adding 31 brings us to Dec 31, which is day 18+31=49 days. Then 60-49=11 days remaining. So adding 11 days to Dec 31 would be January 11. So the maturity date is January 11.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see any option with part a as January 11 except maybe option E and J.

Wait the options are:

Option A: a is Jan 12.

Option E: a is Jan 11.

So if I'm correct, part a is Jan 11. Let's keep that in mind.

Now part (b): June 10, payable 3 months after date. So 3 months after June 10. Well, three months from June is September. So June 10 plus three months would be September 10. But wait, sometimes when adding months, you have to consider the same day in the next month. So June 10 + 3 months is September 10. So the maturity date is September 10. But wait, let me think again: sometimes, if the months have different days, but since June has 30 days, and September also has 30 days, it should be the same day. So it would be September 10. So part b is September 10.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option A: b is Sep 10 → yes.

Option B: b is Sep 8 → no.

Option E: b is Sep 12 → no.

So if part a is Jan 11, and part b is Sep 10, then let's check the options. Let's look for an option where a is Jan 11 and b is Sep 10. Let's see the options:

Option E: a is Jan 11, b is Sep 12 → no.

Option J: a is Jan 11, b is Sep 10 → yes. So part (b) is Sep 10.

Wait, no, let me recheck the options.

Looking back:

Option J: a is Jan 11, b is Sep 10.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, no, the options are A through J, and each option has four dates, a to d.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option A: a) Jan 12, b) Sep 10, c) Apr 14, d) Apr 26.

Option J: a) Jan 11, b) Sep 10, c) Apr 14, d) Apr 25.

Wait, so if part (a) is Jan 11, part (b) Sep 10, then option J has a) Jan 11 and b) Sep 10.

But let's continue with the other parts before getting too deep.

Part (c): March 3, payable 30 days after sight. It was accepted on March 15. So the maturity date is 30 days after acceptance. So March 15 plus 30 days. March has 31 days, so from March 15 to March 31 is 16 days (including the 15th? Wait, if March 15 is day 0, then day 1 is March 16, and 30 days later would be April 14. Let me count: March 15 is day 0, then March 16 is day 1. So 30 days from March 15 would be April 14 (since March has 31 days, so from 15 to 31 is 17 days (including 15?) No, wait: March 15 to March 31 is 17 days (from 15 to 31 inclusive is 17 days), so 30 days after March 15 would be 30 days from March 16 (since March 15 is day 0). Wait, perhaps an easier way is to add 30 days to March 15.

March 15 + 30 days: March has 31 days, so 31 -15 =16 days left in March. So 16 days bring us to March 31, then 30-16=14 days into April. So April 14. So part (c) is April 14.

Looking at the options, part (c) is April 14 in options A, B, D, J.

Now part (d): October 4, payable 6 months after sight. It was accepted on October 25. So the maturity date is 6 months after October 25. So October 25 plus 6 months. Let's see: adding 6 months to October would take us to April. So October to April is 6 months. So October 25 +6 months is April 25. But wait, sometimes when adding months, you have to account for leap years or different month lengths, but in this case, since it's 6 months, it's October to April of the next year. So yes, April 25.

Wait, let me verify: October 25, 2023, plus 6 months would be April 25, 2024. So part (d) is April 25.

Now let's put it all together.

a) Jan 11

b) Sep 10

c) Apr 14

d) Apr 25

Now look at the options. Which option has these four dates in order a to d?

Looking at each option:

Option A: Jan 12, Sep 10, Apr 14, Apr 26 → a is wrong.

Option B: Jan 12, Sep 8, Apr 14, Apr 23 → a and b wrong.

Option C: Jan 10, Sep 11, Apr 15, Apr 26 → nope.

Option D: Jan 12, Sep 9, Apr 13, Apr 24 → no.

Option E: Jan 11, Sep 12, Apr 15, Apr 26 → a correct, but b and c wrong.

Option F: Jan 13, Sep 10, Apr 16, Apr 27 → a wrong.

Option G: Jan 11, Sep 11, Apr 13, Apr 24 → a correct, but others wrong.

Option H: Jan 10, Sep 9, Apr 15, Apr 25 → a wrong.

Option I: Jan 13, Sep 12, Apr 16, Apr 27 → a wrong.

Option J: Jan 11, Sep 10, Apr 14, Apr 25 → Yes! All four parts match.

So the correct answer is option J.

To determine the maturity dates for the drafts, we analyze each part as follows:

### Part (a)
- **Draft dated**: November 12, payable 60 days after date.
- From November 12 to November 30: 18 days.
- Remaining days: 60 - 18 = 42 days.
- December has 31 days, so 31 days bring us to December 31.
- Remaining days: 42 - 31 = 11 days.
- Adding 11 days to December 31: January 11.
- **Maturity date**: January 11.

### Part (b)
- **Draft dated**: June 10, payable 3 months after date.
- 3 months after June 10 is September 10.
- **Maturity date**: September 10.

### Part (c)
- **Draft dated**: March 3, payable 30 days after sight, accepted on March 15.
- 30 days after March 15: March 15 is day 0, so March 16 is day 1.
- March has 31 days, so from March 15 to March 31: 16 days.
- Remaining days: 30 - 16 = 14 days.
- Adding 14 days to March 31: April 14.
- **Maturity date**: April 14.

### Part (d)
- **Draft dated**: October 4, payable 6 months after sight, accepted on October 25.
- 6 months after October 25 is April 25.
- **Maturity date**: April 25.

### Matching with Options
- **Part (a)**: January 11.
- **Part (b)**: September 10.
- **Part (c)**: April 14.
- **Part (d)**: April 25.

The only option that matches all four dates is **Option J**.

**Answer: J**
