Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question is about pheromones, specifically a compound with the formula C19H38O, which has a molar mass of 282 g/mol. The problem states that 10^-12 grams of this compound must be present to be effective. I need to find out how many molecules that corresponds to. The options are from A to J, each with different numbers.

Hmm, right. So I remember that to find the number of molecules, I probably need to use Avogadro's number, which is about 6.022e23 molecules per mole. The steps should be something like: grams to moles, then moles to molecules.

Let me break it down. First, I have 10^-12 grams. The molar mass is 282 g/mol, so moles would be grams divided by molar mass. So, moles = (1e-12 g) / (282 g/mol). Let me calculate that.

Wait, wait. Let me compute that. 1e-12 divided by 282. Let me see, 282 is approximately 2.82e2. So 1e-12 / 2.82e2 = (1 / 2.82) * 1e-14. 1 divided by 2.82 is roughly 0.3547. So, 0.3547e-14 moles, which is 3.547e-15 moles.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1e-12 divided by 282 is 1e-12 / 2.82e2. Let me compute this correctly. 1e-12 is 10^-12, and 2.82e2 is 2.82 * 10^2. So when you divide them, 10^-12 / 10^2 is 10^-14. So 1/(2.82) * 10^-14. So 1/2.82 is about 0.3547. So 0.3547e-14 moles, which is 3.547e-15 moles.

Okay, so that's the number of moles. Now, to get the number of molecules, I multiply by Avogadro's number, which is 6.022e23 molecules/mol.

So, 3.547e-15 mol * 6.022e23 molecules/mol. Let me compute that. Multiply the coefficients first: 3.547 * 6.022 is approximately... Let me calculate that. 3 * 6 is 18, 0.547 *6 is about 3.282. So total around 21.282. But wait, more accurately, 3.547 *6.022.

Let me compute 3.547 *6 =21.282, and 3.547 *0.022 is about 0.078. So total is around 21.36.

Wait, wait, actually, 6.022 is 6 and 0.022. So 3.547 *6 is 21.282, and 3.547 *0.022 is approximately 0.078, adding up to about 21.36. So 21.36e( -15 +23 )=21.36e8.

Wait, because exponents: 1e-15 *1e23 is 1e8. So 21.36e8 is 2.136e9.

Wait, let me double-check the exponent calculation. 1e-15 times 1e23 is indeed 1e8 (because 23-15=8). So 3.547e-15 *6.022e23 = (3.547 *6.022) *1e8.

Wait, but 3.547 *6.022 is approximately 21.36, so 21.36e8. But 21.36e8 is the same as 2.136e9, right?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 21.36e8 is 2.136e9? No, because 21.36 times 1e8 is 2.136 times 1e9. Because 21.36 is 2.136 *10^1, so 2.136 *10^1 *1e8 =2.136e9.

So the number of molecules is approximately 2.136e9.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option I is 2.12e9. That's very close to my calculation. So I think I is the correct answer.

But wait, let me recheck the math because sometimes I make mistakes.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Let me compute (1e-12 g) / (282 g/mol) = 1e-12 /282 = approx 3.55e-15 mol.

Then multiply by Avogadro's number: 3.55e-15 *6.022e23 = (3.55 *6.022) *1e8.

3.55 *6.022 = let's compute that. 3 *6 is 18, 3*0.022=0.066; 0.55*6=3.3, 0.55*0.022=0.0121. So adding up: 18 +0.066=18.066; 3.3 +0.0121=3.3121. Total is 18.066 +3.3121=21.3781.

So 21.3781e8 is 2.13781e9. So approximately 2.14e9.

Looking at the options, I is 2.12e9. Hmm, that's close. Hmm, but maybe my approximation of 1e-12 /282 as 3.55e-15 is a bit off. Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 1e-12 / 282.

Let me compute 1 /282.

1 /282 = approximately 0.00354696... So 3.54696e-3.

Wait, but 1e-12 /282 = (1/282) *1e-12 = 3.54696e-3 *1e-12 = 3.54696e-15.

So 3.54696e-15 mol.

Then, 3.54696e-15 *6.022e23 = ?

3.54696 *6.022 = let me compute that exactly.

3.54696 *6 = 21.28176.

3.54696 *0.022 = 0.07805272.

Adding them: 21.28176 + 0.07805272 = 21.35981 approximately.

So 21.35981e8 is 2.135981e9.

Which is approximately 2.136e9.

Looking at the options, option I is 2.12e9. That's the closest.

Wait, but let me see the options again.

Option I: 2.12 × 10^9

Option E: 7.28 ×10^8

H is 1.5e10, which is higher.

So given the calculation, the number is approximately 2.136e9, which is closest to option I, which is 2.12e9.

So the correct answer should be I.

Wait, but wait a minute, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation steps. Let me think again.

Wait, the molar mass is 282 g/mol. So 1e-12 grams divided by 282 g/mol gives moles.

Yes, that's correct. Then multiply by Avogadro's number to get molecules.

So yes, the steps are correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it step by step more accurately.

Compute 1e-12 divided by 282:

1e-12 /282 = 1/(282e12) ) = approx 3.54696e-15 mol.

Multiply by Avogadro's number, 6.022e23:

3.54696e-15 *6.022e23 = (3.54696 *6.022) *1e8.

3.54696 *6.022.

Let me compute 3.54696 *6.022.

Let me do it digit by digit.

3.54696 × 6.022.

Compute 3.54696 *6 = 21.28176.

Compute 3.54696 *0.022.

0.022 is 22e-3.

3.54696 *0.02 = 0.0709392.

3.54696 *0.002 = 0.00709392.

So 0.0709392 +0.00709392 = 0.07803312.

So total is 21.28176 +0.07803312 =21.35979312.

So 21.35979312e8 is 2.135979312e9.

So about 2.136e9, which is approximately 2.12e9 when rounded to three significant figures.

Wait, but 2.136 is three significant figures. So 2.14e9 perhaps? But the option I is 2.12e9, which is very close. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me check the initial grams and molar mass again. Oh, wait, the molar mass is given as 282 g/mol, correct. So 1e-12 grams.

So the steps are correct. So the answer should be approximately 2.14e9, but the closest option is I: 2.12e9.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact value without approximations.

Let me compute 1e-12 /282 = ?

Compute 1 /282 = approx 0.00354696.

So 0.00354696 *1e-12 = 3.54696e-15.

Multiply by 6.022e23:

3.54696e-15 *6.022e23 = 3.54696 *6.022 *1e8.

3.54696 *6.022 = ?

Let me compute 3.54696 ×6.022 more accurately.

3 *6 =18, 3 *0.022=0.066 → 18.066.

0.54696 ×6 = 3.28176 → 3.28176.

0.54696 ×0.022 = 0.01203392.

So adding all parts:

18.066 (from 3*6.022) 

+3.28176 (from 0.54696*6)

+0.01203392 (from 0.54696*0.022)

Wait, no, perhaps that approach isn't correct. Maybe I should compute it as:

3.54696
×6.022
________

Compute 3.54696 ×6.022:

Break it down:

6.022 = 6 + 0.02 + 0.002.

So,

3.54696 ×6 = 21.28176

3.54696 ×0.02 = 0.0709392

3.54696 ×0.002 =0.00709392

Now add them together:

21.28176 + 0.0709392 =21.3526992

21.3526992 +0.00709392 =21.35979312.

So yes, 21.35979312.

So 21.35979312e8 =2.135979312e9.

So approximately 2.136e9.

Looking at the options, I is 2.12e9, which is very close. So I think that's the intended answer.

But wait, another thought: the given formula is C19H38O, which I can double-check the molar mass.

Calculating molar mass:

C: 12.01 *19 = 228.19

H: 1.008 *38 =38.304

O: 16.00 *1 =16.00

Sum: 228.19 +38.304 =266.494 +16=282.494 g/mol. Oh wait, the problem says 282 g/mol, which matches approximately, so that's correct.

So the calculation is correct. Therefore, the correct answer is I: 2.12 ×10^9 molecules.

To determine how many molecules of the pheromone compound (C₁₉H₃₈O) must be present to be effective, we start with the given data:

- **Molar mass of the compound**: 282 g/mol  
- **Effective mass of the compound**: \(10^{-12} \, \text{g}\)  
- **Avogadro's number**: \(6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{molecules/mol}\)

### Step 1: Convert grams to moles
The number of moles is calculated using the formula:  
\[
\text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar Mass}}
\]
Substituting the values:  
\[
\text{Moles} = \frac{10^{-12} \, \text{g}}{282 \, \text{g/mol}} = 3.54696 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{mol}
\]

### Step 2: Convert moles to molecules
The number of molecules is obtained by multiplying the number of moles by Avogadro's number:  
\[
\text{Molecules} = \text{Moles} \times \text{Avogadro's number}
\]
Substituting the values:  
\[
\text{Molecules} = (3.54696 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{mol}) \times (6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{molecules/mol})
\]
\[
\text{Molecules} = 2.136 \times 10^{9}
\]

### Step 3: Match the closest option
The calculated number of molecules is approximately \(2.136 \times 10^{9}\). Among the given options, the closest value is **Option I: \(2.12 \times 10^{9}\)**.

### Final Answer:
I
