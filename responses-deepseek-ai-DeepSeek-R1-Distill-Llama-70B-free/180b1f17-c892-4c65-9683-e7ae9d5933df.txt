Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about research methods. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is asking which type of research methods are designed to get responses to predetermined, standardized questions from many respondents. Hmm, I remember that research methods can be categorized into different types, like quantitative and qualitative, and then there are others like experimental, longitudinal, etc.

So, the key points in the question are "predetermined, standardized questions" and "many respondents." Predetermined and standardized makes me think of structured methods where the questions are fixed and the same for everyone. That sounds like quantitative research because they often use structured questionnaires or surveys. Quantitative methods are about numerical data and statistical analysis, which usually involves asking the same questions to a large group.

Wait, but then there are other options to consider. Let me look at the options again. The options are A through J. Option C is qualitative, but qualitative methods usually involve open-ended questions or interviews where the questions can change based on responses. So that's probably not it.

Options E is longitudinal, which refers to studies conducted over a long period, maybe tracking the same group over time. But that's more about the time aspect than the method of questioning.

Option B is cross-sectional, which involves looking at data from a population at a single point in time. That could be part of it, but the question is about the method of eliciting responses, not the time frame.

Option F is experimental, which involves manipulating variables to observe effects. That's more about cause and effect rather than just asking questions.

Options G and A are about probability and non-probability sampling methods, which relate to how participants are selected rather than the type of questions asked.

Option H is observational, which is about observing behavior without interference, not necessarily asking questions.

Option I is case study, which is an in-depth analysis of a single case or a small number of cases. That doesn't fit with "many respondents."

So putting it together, the question is about methods that use standardized questions for many people. Quantitative methods (Option J) fit because they use surveys and structured interviews where everyone gets the same questions. But wait, another thought: surveys are a type of quantitative method. So the correct answer should be J: Quantitative.

Wait, but another possibility is that the question is referring to a specific type like surveys. But looking at the options, the choices don't include "survey." So the broader category would be quantitative research methods. Therefore, the answer should be J.

The question asks which research methods involve eliciting responses to predetermined, standardized questions from many respondents. Key characteristics here are the use of fixed, structured questions and a large number of participants. This aligns with quantitative research methods, which often employ surveys or questionnaires to collect numerical data. Other options like qualitative, longitudinal, or experimental methods don't focus on standardized questioning for large groups. Thus, the correct answer is:

J: Quantitative.

Answer: J
