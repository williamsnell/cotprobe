Okay, so I've got this question about defining emotion in terms of feelings, responses, and motivation. Hmm, I need to figure this out. Let's see the options again.

The question is asking for a definition that includes feelings, responses, and motivation. So I should look for an option that covers all three aspects.

Looking at the options one by one. Option A says emotion is a state of anger. That seems too narrow because emotions include more than just anger. So probably not A. Same with D and J, which are just single emotions—happiness and sadness. So those are out.

Option B: Emotion as a behavioral display without internal feelings or motivations. Wait, that doesn't include feelings or motivation, so it's missing parts. So B is probably wrong.

Option C: Conscious experience of affect, limited to pleasure or pain. Affect refers to feelings, but it's limited to just those two, which might be too restrictive. Also, does it include responses and motivation? Not sure, but maybe not comprehensive enough.

Option E: A complex state with heightened arousal, defined by feelings, responses, and motivation. Oh, this sounds promising. It includes all three aspects—feelings, responses (like physiological or behavioral), and motivation. So E could be the right one.

Option F: Involuntary physical reaction without feelings or motivation. Again, missing the feelings and motivation parts, so F is out.

Option G: Long-lasting mood without a clear cause. Moods are different from emotions; emotions are usually shorter and have a cause. Plus, it doesn't mention feelings, responses, or motivation in the definition. So G probably isn't right.

Option H: Physiological response to cognitive judgments. That's part of some theories, like the cognitive theory of emotions. But does it include feelings, responses, and motivation? It mentions responses (physiological) and maybe feelings if that's part of the cognitive part. But motivation isn't explicitly mentioned. So maybe not the best fit.

Option I: Transient social construct varying across cultures. This is more about how emotions are perceived socially and culturally, not defining them in terms of feelings, responses, and motivation. So I doesn't fit the question.

So putting it all together, option E seems to cover all the required aspects: feelings, responses, and motivation, along with heightened arousal which is a common component in emotion definitions.

The correct answer is the option that defines emotion in terms of feelings, responses, and motivation. Option E fits best as it describes emotion as a complex state characterized by heightened arousal and encompasses all three aspects.
