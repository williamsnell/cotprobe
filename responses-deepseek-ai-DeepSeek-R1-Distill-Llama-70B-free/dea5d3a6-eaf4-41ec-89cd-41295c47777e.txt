Okay, so I have this calculus problem here. I'm supposed to find the derivative of g(x) at x=1, where g(x) is 1 divided by (1 plus x raised to the 3/2 power). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when you have a function like 1 over something, it's often easier to use the chain rule or maybe rewrite it to make differentiation simpler. So, g(x) = 1 / (1 + x^(3/2)). Maybe I can write this as (1 + x^(3/2))^-1. That might make taking the derivative easier because I can apply the power rule along with the chain rule.

So, taking the derivative of g(x), which is written as (1 + x^(3/2))^-1. The derivative of u^n is n*u^(n-1) * u', right? So here, u is (1 + x^(3/2)), and n is -1.

Let me compute the derivative step by step. The derivative of g with respect to x would be -1*(1 + x^(3/2))^(-2) times the derivative of the inside function, which is 1 + x^(3/2).

Wait, no, the chain rule says that the derivative of u^n is n*u^(n-1) * u'. So the outside function is u^(-1), so the derivative of that is -1*u^(-2), and then multiplied by the derivative of the inside u.

So putting that together: g'(x) = -1*(1 + x^(3/2))^(-2) * (d/dx)(1 + x^(3/2)).

Now, I need to find the derivative of (1 + x^(3/2)). The derivative of 1 is zero, and the derivative of x^(3/2) is (3/2) * x^(1/2), right? Because when you take the derivative of x^n, it's n*x^(n-1).

So putting that into the equation, the derivative of the inside is (3/2) * x^(1/2). So now, g'(x) is:

g'(x) = -1 * (1 + x^(3/2))^(-2) * (3/2) * x^(1/2).

Simplify that expression. The constants can be multiplied together. So -1 * (3/2) is -3/2. So:

g'(x) = (-3/2) * x^(1/2) / (1 + x^(3/2))^2.

Okay, now I need to evaluate this at x=1. Let's plug in x=1.

First, compute x^(1/2) at x=1. That's sqrt(1) which is 1.

Then, compute the denominator: (1 + (1)^(3/2))^2. The 3/2 power of 1 is 1, because any number to any power is 1 if the base is 1. So 1 + 1 is 2. Then square that: 2^2 is 4.

So putting it all together, g'(1) is (-3/2) * 1 / 4. So (-3/2) divided by 4 is the same as (-3/2) * (1/4) = -3/8.

Wait, but let me double-check that. 1 + 1^(3/2) is 2, squared is 4. So denominator is 4. So numerator is (-3/2)*1 = -3/2. So g'(1) is (-3/2)/4, which is indeed -3/(2*4) = -3/8.

Hmm, but wait, I'm looking at the answer options and I don't see -3/8 as an option. Let me see the options again. The options are:

A: -0.375 â†’ which is -3/8 because 3 divided by 8 is 0.375.

Wait, yes, because 1/8 is 0.125, so 3/8 is 0.375. So -3/8 is -0.375, which is option A.

Wait, but I thought I saw an option I as -0.5. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the differentiation steps. Let me go through the steps again.

g(x) = 1/(1 + x^(3/2)) = (1 + x^(3/2))^-1.

g'(x) = -1*(1 + x^(3/2))^-2 * (d/dx)(1 +x^(3/2)).

The derivative of 1 is 0, and the derivative of x^(3/2) is (3/2)x^(1/2). So yes, that's correct.

So g'(x) = - (3/2) x^(1/2) / (1 + x^(3/2))^2.

At x=1:

x^(1/2) is 1, denominator is (1 + 1) squared which is 4.

So numerator is 3/2, so (3/2)/4 is 3/(8), but with a negative sign, so -3/8 = -0.375.

So the correct answer should be A: -0.375.

Wait, but looking back, the options are:

A: -0.375

Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be A.

To find the derivative of \( g(x) = \frac{1}{1 + x^{3/2}} \) at \( x = 1 \), we start by rewriting \( g(x) \) as \( (1 + x^{3/2})^{-1} \). Using the chain rule, the derivative of \( g(x) \) is:

\[
g'(x) = -1 \cdot (1 + x^{3/2})^{-2} \cdot \frac{d}{dx}(1 + x^{3/2}).
\]

The derivative of \( 1 + x^{3/2} \) is \( \frac{3}{2}x^{1/2} \), so:

\[
g'(x) = -\frac{3}{2} \cdot x^{1/2} \cdot (1 + x^{3/2})^{-2}.
\]

At \( x = 1 \), we compute:

- \( x^{1/2} = \sqrt{1} = 1 \),
- \( 1 + x^{3/2} = 1 + 1 = 2 \), and
- \( (1 + x^{3/2})^2 = 2^2 = 4 \).

Substituting these values:

\[
g'(1) = -\frac{3}{2} \cdot 1 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = -\frac{3}{8}.
\]

Since \( -\frac{3}{8} = -0.375 \), the correct answer is:

A: -0.375.
