Question:

Bill, a single man, owned pasture land in Deerwoods, Florida, which he leased to a tenant. He also owned a condominium in Miami, which he held for investment. In his will, he devised the pasture land to his son Tommy and the condominium to his daughter Julie. All other assets would pass equally to Tommy and Julie. Bill met Kathy and married her after she executed a valid prenuptial agreement relinquishing all rights she might otherwise enjoy by marrying Bill. On their Miami honeymoon they drove by the condominium and Kathy declared she'd love to live there. Bill was so happy with Kathy that after the honeymoon he signed and delivered to Kathy a deed conveying the condominium to himself and Kathy as an estate by the entirety and made plans to live in the condominium as soon as the tenant vacated. Bill died the next day. How are the foregoing assets distributed?

Options:

A: Kathy gets the condominium, but because Bill had originally indicated his intent to devise equally to his children, Tommy and Julie will split the remaining estate.
B: Julie receives the condominium due to her father's original will, Tommy gets the pasture land, and the rest of the estate is split between Tommy and Julie.
C: Kathy gets the condominium due to the deed, Tommy gets the pasture land, and the rest of the estate is split evenly between Tommy, Julie, and Kathy.
D: Kathy, as the surviving spouse, gets the entire estate regardless of the prenuptial agreement.
E: Tommy and Julie split all assets equally, as the prenuptial agreement nullifies any changes made after the marriage.
F: Regardless of the prenuptial agreement, Kathy is a pretermitted spouse. Since Bill leaves surviving lineal descendants who are not Kathy's, Kathy receives 50% of the estate, Tommy gets the pasture land, and Tommy and Julie split the residue of the estate.
G: Kathy gets the condominium regardless of the prenuptial agreement, Tommy takes the pasture land and Tommy and Julie split the rest of the estate.
H: Tommy receives the pasture land, Julie gets the condominium, and the rest of the estate is split between Tommy and Julie, as Kathy signed a prenuptial agreement.
I: Tommy gets the pasture land, Kathy gets the condominium due to her husband's last wish, and the remaining estate is split between Tommy, Julie, and Kathy.
J: Due to Kathy's prenuptial agreement, Tommy receives the pasture land, Julie gets the condominium and Tommy and Julie split the rest of the estate.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about estate distribution after someone dies. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about Bill, who owned two properties: pasture land in Deerwoods, Florida, which he leased to a tenant, and a condominium in Miami that he held as an investment. He had a will that left the pasture land to his son Tommy and the condo to his daughter Julie. The rest of his assets were to be split equally between Tommy and Julie.

Then, Bill met Kathy, and they got married after Kathy signed a valid prenuptial agreement. This agreement relinquished all the rights she might have otherwise had by marrying Bill. So, Kathy can't claim any of Bill's assets that she wouldn't have under the prenup.

After their honeymoon in Miami, Bill decided to give Kathy the condominium. He did this by signing and delivering a deed that conveyed the condo to both himself and Kathy as an estate by the entirety. Estate by entirety means they both own it together, with the right of survivorship. So if one dies, the other gets the whole property.

Bill died the next day. The question is about how the assets are distributed now.

I need to figure out what happens to each property and the rest of the estate. Let me go through each asset.

First, the pasture land. Bill's will left it to Tommy. But after the will was made, Bill got married. I remember that marriage can sometimes revoke a will, but in some states, it doesn't unless the will was made in contemplation of the marriage. But the question doesn't say that the will was made in contemplation of marriage, so maybe the will still stands. Also, prenuptial agreements can affect this, but I'm not sure. So perhaps the pasture land still goes to Tommy as per the will.

Next, the condominium. Bill conveyed it to himself and Kathy as tenants by the entirety. Once that deed was delivered, the condo became jointly owned. So when Bill dies, Kathy gets the entire condo because of the right of survivorship in a tenancy by entirety. Even if the will said it goes to Julie, the deed was delivered before his death, so the will might not affect it. So the condo goes to Kathy.

As for the rest of the estate, the will says that all other assets pass equally to Tommy and Julie. But wait, Kathy is Bill's spouse. Normally, a spouse has certain rights, like an elective share, which allows them to take a portion of the estate even if the will says otherwise. But in this case, Kathy signed a prenuptial agreement where she relinquished all her rights. So she can't take an elective share or any other spousal rights. So the rest of the estate is split equally between Tommy and Julie.

So putting it all together:

- Pasture land: Tommy (as per the will)
- Condominium: Kathy (because of the deed)
- Remaining assets: Split equally between Tommy and Julie.

Looking at the options:

Option G says Kathy gets the condo, Tommy gets pasture land, and the rest split between Tommy and Julie. That matches what I thought.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option G: Kathy gets the condominium regardless of the prenup, Tommy takes pasture land, and Tommy and Julie split the rest.

Yes, that's correct.

I think that's the right answer, so the correct option is G.

The correct distribution of Bill's assets is as follows:

1. **Pasture Land**: Bill's will devises the pasture land to his son Tommy. Marriage to Kathy does not revoke the will, and the prenuptial agreement does not affect this specific devise. Therefore, Tommy inherits the pasture land.

2. **Condominium**: After marrying Kathy, Bill conveyed the condominium to himself and Kathy as tenants by the entirety. This deed was validly executed and delivered, granting Kathy a right of survivorship. Upon Bill's death, Kathy automatically inherits the entire condominium, regardless of the prenuptial agreement or the original will.

3. **Remaining Assets**: Bill's will directs that all other assets be split equally between Tommy and Julie. Kathy, having signed a valid prenuptial agreement relinquishing her rights to Bill's estate, is not entitled to any share of the remaining assets. Thus, Tommy and Julie each receive half of the remaining estate.

The correct answer is **G**: Kathy gets the condominium regardless of the prenuptial agreement, Tommy takes the pasture land, and Tommy and Julie split the rest of the estate.

**Answer: G**
