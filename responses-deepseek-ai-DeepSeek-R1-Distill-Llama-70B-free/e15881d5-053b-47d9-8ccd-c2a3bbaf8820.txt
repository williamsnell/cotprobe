Question:

How will the cross elasticity of demand differ, depending upon whether product A is a complement of or substitute for product B?

Options:

A: The cross elasticity of demand for A with respect to the price of B will be positive only if both goods are luxury items.
B: The cross elasticity of demand for A will be infinite if good B's price changes.
C: The cross elasticity of demand for A with respect to the price of B will be zero
D: The cross elasticity of demand for A with respect to the price of B will always be positive
E: The cross elasticity of demand for A with respect to the price of B will be positive if A is a normal good and B is an inferior good.
F: If good A is a complement of good B, the cross elasticity of demand for A with respect to the price of B will be negative. If good A is a substitute for good B, the cross elasticity of demand for A with respect to the price of B will be positive.
G: The cross elasticity of demand for A with respect to the price of B will be positive if A and B are unrelated goods.
H: The cross elasticity of demand for A with respect to the price of B will be the same regardless of whether A is a complement or substitute for B.
I: The cross elasticity of demand for A with respect to the price of B will always be negative
J: If good A is a complement of good B, the cross elasticity of demand for A with respect to the price of B will be positive. If good A is a substitute for good B, the cross elasticity of demand for A with respect to the price of B will be negative.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about cross elasticity of demand, and I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me start by recalling what cross elasticity of demand means.

From what I remember, cross elasticity of demand measures how the quantity demanded of one good (let's say Good A) responds to a change in the price of another good (Good B). The formula is something like the percentage change in quantity demanded of A divided by the percentage change in price of B. 

Now, the question is asking how this cross elasticity differs depending on whether Good A is a complement or a substitute for Good B. So I need to think about what happens in both scenarios.

First, substitutes. If Good A is a substitute for Good B, that means when the price of B goes up, people are more likely to buy A instead. So the demand for A would increase. That would mean that the quantity demanded of A increases when B's price increases. So, the cross elasticity would be positive because both the numerator and denominator are positive percentages. Wait, because if price of B goes up (positive change) and quantity of A goes up (positive change), the cross elasticity is positive.

Next, complements. If A and B are complements, like maybe coffee and sugar, when the price of B (sugar) goes up, people buy less sugar. But since they're complements, they might buy less coffee too. So when B's price increases, quantity demanded of A decreases. So the numerator would be a negative percentage change in A's quantity, and the denominator is a positive percentage change in B's price. So the cross elasticity would be negative because it's negative divided by positive.

Looking at the options now. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A says the cross elasticity is positive only if both are luxury. Hmm, I don't think that's right. I think it's about substitutes or complements, not their being luxury items. So probably not A.

Option B says cross elasticity is infinite if B's price changes. That doesn't make sense because elasticity is a measure, not necessarily infinite unless demand is perfectly responsive, which isn't generally the case here.

Option C says cross elasticity is zero. No, that would mean they're unrelated, but the question is about when they are complements or substitutes, so C isn't right.

Option D says it's always positive. No, because for complements it's negative, so D is incorrect.

Option E suggests positive if A is normal and B is inferior. I don't think that's the main factor here. It's more about substitute vs complement, not their individual types (normal or inferior). So E doesn't seem right.

Option F: If A is a complement of B, cross elasticity is negative. If substitute, positive. That matches what I was thinking earlier. So F looks correct.

Option G says positive if unrelated. No, unrelated goods would have zero cross elasticity, so G is wrong.

Option H says it's the same regardless. No, because substitute and complement have opposite signs, so H is incorrect.

Option I says always negative. No, because substitutes have positive cross elasticity, so I is wrong.

Option J: If A is a complement, cross elasticity is positive. Substitute, negative. That's the opposite of what I thought. Because when A is a complement, B's price up leads to A's quantity down, so cross elasticity is negative. So J is incorrect.

So the correct answer should be option F.

The cross elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of the quantity demanded of one good (A) to a change in the price of another good (B). If Good A is a substitute for Good B, an increase in B's price leads to an increase in the demand for A, resulting in a positive cross elasticity. Conversely, if Good A is a complement to Good B, an increase in B's price leads to a decrease in the demand for A, resulting in a negative cross elasticity.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. Cross elasticity depends on whether goods are substitutes or complements, not whether they are luxury items.
- **B**: Incorrect. Cross elasticity is not infinite unless demand is perfectly responsive, which is not generally the case.
- **C**: Incorrect. Cross elasticity is zero only if goods are unrelated, but the question assumes they are either substitutes or complements.
- **D**: Incorrect. Cross elasticity is not always positive; it is negative for complements.
- **E**: Incorrect. Cross elasticity depends on whether goods are substitutes or complements, not their classification as normal or inferior goods.
- **F**: Correct. If A is a complement of B, cross elasticity is negative; if A is a substitute for B, cross elasticity is positive.
- **G**: Incorrect. Unrelated goods have zero cross elasticity, not positive.
- **H**: Incorrect. Cross elasticity differs based on whether goods are substitutes or complements.
- **I**: Incorrect. Cross elasticity is not always negative; it is positive for substitutes.
- **J**: Incorrect. It reverses the correct relationship between complements and substitutes.

The correct answer is **F**.
