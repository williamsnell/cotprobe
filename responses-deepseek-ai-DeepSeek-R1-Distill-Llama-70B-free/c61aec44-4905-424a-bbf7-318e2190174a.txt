Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the theoretical density of calcium. Hmm, I remember that density is mass over volume, but I'm a bit rusty on the exact formula when it comes to unit cells. Let me think.

So the problem says calcium crystallizes in a face-centered cubic (fcc) structure. Right, fcc means the unit cell has atoms at each corner and one in the center of each face. Wait, how many atoms does that come out to per unit cell? Oh yeah, in an fcc, each corner atom is shared among eight adjacent cubes, so that's 8*(1/8) = 1 atom from the corners. Then each face has an atom shared between two cubes, so 6 faces * (1/2) = 3 atoms. So total z (effective number of atoms per unit cell) is 4. Oh wait, the question says z is 3. Wait, no, wait. No, I think z is given here as 3. Wait, maybe I'm mixing something up.

Wait, the question says "z = content =3". So maybe z is 3. Hmm, but wait, for fcc the number of atoms per unit cell is 4, right? Because corners contribute 1, faces contribute 3, so 4 total. So why is z given as 3 here? Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Oh wait, perhaps the user made a typo, but regardless, the given z is 3, so I'll proceed with that.

Oh wait, no, maybe I should double-check. In fcc, the unit cell has 4 atoms. So maybe the question is correct in giving z=4, but wait, the question says z=3. Hmm, perhaps it's a typo, but I have to go with what's given. Maybe it's a different structure, but no, the question says fcc. Hmm, I'm confused. But perhaps the given z is correct, so I'll proceed with z=3.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. The unit cell for fcc is face-centered cubic, which has 4 atoms per unit cell. So the formula for density uses z as the number of atoms per unit cell. So maybe the given z=3 is incorrect, but I have to go with the problem's data. Alternatively, perhaps the problem meant z=4, but the user wrote z=3. But I need to proceed with the given data.

Wait, the question gives a = 3.48 Å, and z =3. Wait, but wait, calcium's crystal structure is actually fcc, right? So I'm pretty sure z should be 4. But maybe the question is correct, and I'm to proceed with the given data. So let's proceed.

The formula for density is (Z * M) / (N_A * a^3) * 1e-24, because a is in angstroms (which are 1e-10 meters), but wait, maybe I should convert a to meters first.

Wait, let's outline the steps:

1. Calculate the volume of the unit cell. Since a is given in angstroms, I need to convert it to meters.

2. Find the mass of the unit cell, which is Z multiplied by the molar mass of calcium, divided by Avogadro's number.

3. Density is mass divided by volume.

So first, the volume. a = 3.48 Å = 3.48e-10 meters (since 1 Å = 1e-10 m). Volume is a^3, so (3.48e-10 m)^3.

Let me compute that: 3.48^3 is approx 3.48 *3.48=12.1104, then *3.48 again. Let me calculate that more accurately.

3.48 *3.48: 3*3=9, 3*0.48=1.44, 0.48*3=1.44, 0.48^2=0.2304. So 3.48^2 is 12.1104. Now multiply by 3.48 again:

12.1104 *3.48. Let me compute that:

12 *3.48 =41.76

0.1104 *3.48 ≈ 0.384192

So total is approx 41.76 + 0.384192=42.144192. So (3.48e-10)^3 ≈42.144e-30 m^3, which is 4.2144e-29 m^3.

Wait, no, wait. 3.48e-10 cubed is (3.48)^3 * (1e-10)^3 = 42.144 * 1e-30 = 4.2144e-29 m³.

Next, the mass of the unit cell. Calcium's molar mass is about 40.078 g/mol. So per mole, it's 40.078 g. So per unit cell, with Z atoms, the mass is (Z * M) / (N_A).

Wait, Z is given as 3. So mass m = (3 * 40.078 g/mol) / (6.022e23 mol⁻¹).

Wait, but wait, the units need to be consistent. Let's compute this.

Mass m = (3 * 40.078) / (6.022e23) grams. So 120.234 / 6.022e23 = approx 1.994e-22 grams per unit cell.

Convert that to kg: 1.994e-22 g = 1.994e-25 kg.

Now, density d = mass / volume. So 1.994e-25 kg / 4.2144e-29 m³.

Let me compute that: 1.994e-25 /4.2144e-29 = (1.994 /4.2144) * 1e4.

1.994 /4.2144 ≈ 0.473. So 0.473 *1e4 =4730 kg/m³.

Wait, that's 4.73e3 kg/m³.

Wait, but looking at the options, option A is 4.738e3. That's very close to my approximation. So the correct answer should be around 4.7e3, which matches option A.

Wait, but wait a second. Earlier I thought that in fcc, Z is 4, but the problem says Z=3. But wait, if I use Z=4, let's see what happens.

Let me recalculate with Z=4, just in case. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.

So with Z=4, mass becomes (4 *40.078)/(6.022e23) = 160.312 /6.022e23 ≈ 2.662e-22 grams = 2.662e-25 kg.

Volume is same, 4.2144e-29 m³.

So density d= 2.662e-25 /4.2144e-29 = approx (2.662/4.2144)*1e4.

2.662/4.2144≈0.6318. So 0.6318e4=6318 kg/m³. That's 6.318e3, which isn't one of the options. So that can't be right.

But wait, the given options don't have 6.3e3 except option F (6.238e3). Hmm, but the problem states Z=3, so my initial calculation with Z=3 gives 4.73e3, which is option A.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about the Z value. If the question says Z=3, but fcc has Z=4, perhaps the question is incorrect. But I have to use the given data, so I must proceed with Z=3, leading to option A.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate the density with Z=3.

Compute the mass:

Z=3, M=40.078 g/mol.

Mass = (3 *40.078) / (6.022e23) grams.

3*40.078=120.234 g/mol.

So 120.234 /6.022e23 = 1.994e-22 grams.

Convert to kg: 1.994e-25 kg.

Volume: a=3.48e-10 m.

Volume = (3.48e-10)^3 = 3.48^3 *1e-30 =42.144 *1e-30=4.2144e-29 m³.

Density d=1.994e-25 kg /4.2144e-29 m³.

1.994e-25 /4.2144e-29 = (1.994 /4.2144) * 1e4.

1.994 /4.2144 ≈ 0.473.

0.473 *1e4=4730 kg/m³.

Which is 4.73e3, matching option A:4.738e3.

So the correct answer should be A.

To calculate the theoretical density of calcium, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Density} = \frac{Z \cdot M}{N_A \cdot a^3}
\]

Where:
- \( Z \) is the number of atoms per unit cell (given as 3),
- \( M \) is the molar mass of calcium (\( 40.078 \, \text{g/mol} \)),
- \( N_A \) is Avogadro's number (\( 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{mol}^{-1} \)),
- \( a \) is the lattice parameter (\( 3.48 \, \text{Å} = 3.48 \times 10^{-10} \, \text{m} \)).

### Step 1: Calculate the volume of the unit cell
The volume of the unit cell is given by \( a^3 \):
\[
a^3 = (3.48 \times 10^{-10})^3 = 3.48^3 \times 10^{-30} = 42.144 \times 10^{-30} = 4.2144 \times 10^{-29} \, \text{m}^3
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the mass of the unit cell
The mass of the unit cell is the mass of \( Z \) atoms:
\[
\text{Mass} = \frac{Z \cdot M}{N_A} = \frac{3 \cdot 40.078}{6.022 \times 10^{23}} = \frac{120.234}{6.022 \times 10^{23}} \approx 1.994 \times 10^{-22} \, \text{g}
\]
Convert to kilograms:
\[
\text{Mass} = 1.994 \times 10^{-22} \, \text{g} = 1.994 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{kg}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the density
The density is the mass divided by the volume:
\[
\text{Density} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Volume}} = \frac{1.994 \times 10^{-25}}{4.2144 \times 10^{-29}}
\]
\[
\text{Density} = \frac{1.994}{4.2144} \times 10^{4} \approx 0.473 \times 10^{4} = 4.73 \times 10^{3} \, \text{kg/m}^3
\]

### Final Answer
The calculated density is approximately \( 4.73 \times 10^{3} \, \text{kg/m}^3 \), which matches option **A**.
