Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the pH of a urine sample. Hmm, I remember that pH is related to the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution. Let me think through this step by step.

The question says that before pH meters, a urologist collected 1.3 liters of urine, and the lab found 1.3e-6 equivalents of dissociated acid. Wait, equivalents of acid... Right, equivalents in chemistry usually refer to the amount of a substance that can donate or accept a certain number of protons (H+ ions). So one equivalent of a strong acid like HCl would give one mole of H+ ions.

So the problem is about finding the pH based on the number of equivalents of acid. I think the formula I need is pH = -log[H+], where [H+] is the concentration of hydrogen ions in moles per liter.

But wait, the equivalents given are 1.3e-6. Since equivalents for a monoprotic acid are the same as moles of H+ (because each equivalent is one mole of H+), this should directly give me the concentration if I divide by the volume.

Wait, the volume is 1.3 liters. So the concentration of H+ ions would be (1.3e-6 equivalents) / 1.3 liters. Let me calculate that. 1.3e-6 divided by 1.3 is 1e-6. Oh, that's neat. So [H+] is 1e-6 M.

So plugging that into the pH formula: pH = -log(1e-6). I remember that log(1e-6) is -6, so the negative of that is 6. So the pH should be 6.

Wait, but wait a second. Urine is usually slightly acidic, right? I think normal urine pH ranges from about 4.6 to 8, but typically around 5-6. So pH 6 makes sense in that context.

Alternatively, let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. Equivalents of acid would be the same as milliequivalents if the volume is in liters. Wait, no. Equivalents (Eq) are moles of charge. For H+ it's 1 Eq per mole. So if the sample has 1.3e-6 Eq, then the concentration is (1.3e-6 Eq) / (1.3 L) = 1e-6 M. So [H+] is 1e-6, pH is 6. So the correct answer should be B:6.

To calculate the pH of the urine sample, we start by determining the concentration of hydrogen ions \([H^+]\). The problem states that the sample contains \(1.3 \times 10^{-6}\) equivalents of dissociated acid, and the volume of the sample is 1.3 liters. Since one equivalent of a monoprotic acid corresponds to one mole of \(H^+\), the concentration of \(H^+\) is:

\[
[H^+] = \frac{\text{equivalents of acid}}{\text{volume in liters}} = \frac{1.3 \times 10^{-6}}{1.3} = 1 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}.
\]

The pH is then calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{pH} = -\log[H^+].
\]

Substituting \([H^+] = 1 \times 10^{-6}\):

\[
\text{pH} = -\log(1 \times 10^{-6}) = 6.
\]

This result aligns with the typical pH range of urine, which is slightly acidic, often between 4.6 and 8, with a common value around 5-6. Therefore, the pH of the sample is 6.

The correct answer is **B: 6**.
