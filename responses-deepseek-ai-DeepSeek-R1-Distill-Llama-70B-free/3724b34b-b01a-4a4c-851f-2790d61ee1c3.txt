Okay, so I have this logic problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step. The question is about determining whether a set of propositions is consistent using indirect truth tables. If it's consistent, I need to choose an option that provides a consistent valuation. Otherwise, I'll choose an inconsistent option.

Alright, the propositions given are:

1. (T ⊃ U) ⊃ (W ⊃ U)
2. T ⊃ ~(U ⊃ X)
3. (T ⊃ ~X) ⊃ W

And the options are A through E, with some being inconsistent and others consistent with specific truth values assigned to T, U, W, and X.

First, I need to understand what each proposition means and how to approach checking consistency. Remember, a set of propositions is consistent if there's at least one truth valuation that makes all of them true. If no such valuation exists, then the set is inconsistent.

So I'll need to try to find a valuation where all three propositions are true. If I can't find any such valuation, the set is inconsistent.

Let me break down each proposition.

Proposition 1: (T ⊃ U) ⊃ (W ⊃ U)

This can be a bit tricky. Let me rewrite it using logical equivalences. I know that A ⊃ B is equivalent to ~A ∨ B. So let's apply that.

First, the antecedent is (T ⊃ U), which is ~T ∨ U. The entire proposition is (~T ∨ U) ⊃ (W ⊃ U). Applying the same equivalence again, this becomes ~(~T ∨ U) ∨ (W ⊃ U). Simplify the negation: (T ∧ ~U) ∨ ( ~W ∨ U). So that's T ∧ ~U ∨ ~W ∨ U.

Wait, that might be a bit messy. Maybe it's easier to think about the truth table approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can find the contrapositive or other logical equivalents to simplify.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider each proposition and see what they imply.

Proposition 2: T ⊃ ~(U ⊃ X)

Again, using equivalences. U ⊃ X is ~U ∨ X. So ~(U ⊃ X) is U ∧ ~X. So proposition 2 becomes T ⊃ (U ∧ ~X). Which is equivalent to ~T ∨ (U ∧ ~X). So if T is true, then U must be true and X must be false.

Proposition 3: (T ⊃ ~X) ⊃ W

Again, let's break it down. T ⊃ ~X is ~T ∨ ~X. So the proposition is (~T ∨ ~X) ⊃ W, which is equivalent to T ∧ X ⊃ W. So if both T and X are true, then W must be true.

Hmm. So let's try to see what happens when we assume each proposition is true.

I think the best approach is to try to assign truth values to each variable and see if all three propositions can be true.

Let me consider possible assignments. Since there are four variables, that's 16 possible combinations, but maybe I can find one quickly.

Let me try to see if there's an assignment where all three propositions are true.

Option D says that when U, W, X are true and T is false, it's consistent. Let me check that.

So T is false, U is true, W is true, X is true.

Check each proposition:

1. (T ⊃ U) ⊃ (W ⊃ U)
T is false, so T⊃U is true (because a false antecedent makes the implication true). Now, W is true, U is true, so W⊃U is true. So the first proposition is true.

2. T ⊃ ~(U ⊃ X)
T is false, so the whole implication is true, regardless of the consequent. So proposition 2 is true.

3. (T ⊃ ~X) ⊃ W
T is false, so T⊃~X is true (since false implies anything). So the antecedent is true, and W is true. So the implication is true.

So all three propositions are true in this case. So the set is consistent, and option D is a correct valuation. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but let me check another option just to be sure. Option C says T, U, X are true and W is false.

So T=T, U=T, X=T, W=F.

Check each proposition:

1. (T⊃U) is T⊃T which is T. So (T) ⊃ (W⊃U). W is F, so W⊃U is F⊃T, which is T. So (T)⊃T is T. So proposition 1 holds.

2. T⊃~(U⊃X). U⊃X is T⊃T=T, so ~(U⊃X)=F. So T⊃F is F. So proposition 2 is false in this case. So this valuation doesn't satisfy all propositions. So option C is not a correct valuation.

So only option D works.

Alternatively, let me see if the set is consistent. Since I found at least one valuation where all are true, the set is consistent. So any option that says inconsistent (like E, A, B) is wrong. The correct answer is either C or D. But in option C, proposition 2 fails, so D is correct.

Wait, but are there any other possible valuations that might work? Maybe I should consider other combinations just to be thorough.

Another possible approach: Let's try to find a model where all three are true.

Looking at proposition 2: T ⊃ (U ∧ ~X)

If T is true, then U must be true and X must be false.

So let's try T=T, U=T, X=F.

Now, what about W?

Looking at proposition 3: (T⊃~X)⊃ W.

T⊃~X is T⊃T (since X=F, ~X=T), so T⊃T is T. So this proposition becomes T⊃W, which is equivalent to ~T ∨ W. Since T is T, this simplifies to W. So W must be true.

So in this case, W must be true.

So let's set T=T, U=T, X=F, W=T.

Now check all propositions:

1. (T⊃U)=T⊃T=T. W⊃U is T⊃T=T. So (T)⊃(T)=T. So proposition 1 holds.

2. T⊃(U ∧ ~X)= T⊃(T ∧ T)= T⊃T=T. So proposition 2 holds.

3. (T⊃~X)⊃W= (T⊃T)⊃T= T⊃T=T. So proposition 3 holds.

So this is another valuation where all are true. So the set is consistent, and either option D or this valuation is correct. Wait, none of the options except D and C are in the options. Wait, the options only give specific valuations. Option D is when U, W, X are true and T is false. Another possible valuation is T=T, U=T, X=F, W=T. But that's not one of the options. So among the given options, option D is correct.

So the answer is D.

To determine whether the set of propositions is consistent, we analyze each proposition and check if there exists at least one truth valuation that makes all of them true. The propositions are:

1. **(T ⊃ U) ⊃ (W ⊃ U)**  
   Using logical equivalences, this simplifies to **T ∧ ~U ∨ ~W ∨ U**, which is always true when U is true or W is false.

2. **T ⊃ ~(U ⊃ X)**  
   This simplifies to **T ⊃ (U ∧ ~X)**. If T is true, then U must be true and X must be false. If T is false, the implication is automatically true.

3. **(T ⊃ ~X) ⊃ W**  
   This simplifies to **T ∧ X ⊃ W**. If both T and X are true, then W must be true. If T is false, the implication is automatically true.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Inconsistent. Inconsistent valuation when T, U, W, and X are all false.  
  - If T, U, W, and X are all false, proposition 2 (**T ⊃ ~(U ⊃ X)**) becomes **False ⊃ ~(False ⊃ False)**, which is **False ⊃ ~(True)**, or **False ⊃ False**, which is true. Thus, this valuation does not make the set inconsistent.

- **Option B**: Inconsistent. Inconsistent valuation when T, U, W, and X are all true.  
  - If T, U, W, and X are all true, proposition 2 (**T ⊃ ~(U ⊃ X)**) becomes **True ⊃ ~(True ⊃ True)**, which is **True ⊃ ~(True)**, or **True ⊃ False**, which is false. Thus, this valuation makes the set inconsistent.

- **Option C**: Consistent. Consistent valuation when T, U, and X are true and W is false.  
  - If T, U, and X are true and W is false, proposition 1 (**(T ⊃ U) ⊃ (W ⊃ U)**) is true, but proposition 3 (**(T ⊃ ~X) ⊃ W**) becomes **(True ⊃ False) ⊃ False**, which is **False ⊃ False**, or true. However, proposition 2 (**T ⊃ ~(U ⊃ X)**) becomes **True ⊃ ~(True ⊃ True)**, which is **True ⊃ False**, or false. Thus, this valuation does not satisfy all propositions.

- **Option D**: Consistent. Consistent valuation when U, W, and X are true and T is false.  
  - If U, W, and X are true and T is false, proposition 1 (**(T ⊃ U) ⊃ (W ⊃ U)**) is true, proposition 2 (**T ⊃ ~(U ⊃ X)**) is automatically true because T is false, and proposition 3 (**(T ⊃ ~X) ⊃ W**) is also true because T is false. Thus, this valuation satisfies all propositions.

- **Option E**: Inconsistent.  
  - Since we found at least one valuation (Option D) where all propositions are true, the set is consistent, and this option is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The set of propositions is consistent, and the correct consistent valuation is when U, W, and X are true and T is false.
