Question:

A man worked as a clerk in a gourmet coffee shop. His friend often stopped by the shop to chat with the man while the man was working. One afternoon, while the friend was visiting the shop, the man needed to use the bathroom. There were no customers in the shop at that moment, so the man asked the friend to watch the store for him while he went in the back to use the bathroom. The friend agreed to do so. While the man was in the bathroom, a customer came into the store. She wanted to purchase some freshly ground coffee. The shop had a grinding machine that customers could use. The customer selected a bag of coffee beans and then took it to the grinding machine. She was unsure how to start the machine, so she asked the friend for help. The friend tried to show the customer how to use the machine, but he was not familiar with how it worked, and he gave the customer erroneous instructions. The customer tried to follow the friend's instructions, but this led to her getting her finger pinched and cut by the machine. If the customer asserts a claim against the coffee shop company for her finger injury, the customer will most likely

Options:

A: prevail, because the company should have had a warning sign about the dangers of the machine.
B: not prevail, because the company is not liable for the friend's negligence.
C: prevail, because the company would be vicariously liable for the man's unauthorized actions.
D: not prevail, because the customer should have waited for an employee to operate the machine.
E: not prevail, because the friend was acting as a Good Samaritan.
F: not prevail, because the man acted outside the scope of employment by entrusting the supervision of the shop to his friend.
G: prevail, because the company failed to properly train the man on how to operate the machine.
H: not prevail, because the friend was not an employee of the coffee shop.
I: prevail, because the company failed to ensure that the man was never left alone in the shop.
J: prevail, because the friend's negligence would be imputed to the company.

Okay, let's try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about a situation where a man who works as a clerk in a coffee shop asks his friend to watch the store while he uses the bathroom. While he's away, a customer comes in, tries to use the grinding machine, and gets hurt because the friend gave her wrong instructions. The question is whether the customer can successfully sue the coffee shop company for her injury.

First, I need to understand the legal concepts involved here. This seems to be a case about vicarious liability, which is when an employer is held responsible for the actions of an employee performed within the scope of their employment. So, if the friend were an employee, the company might be liable. But the friend isn't an employee—he's just a friend helping out.

Wait, but the friend was watching the store at the clerk's request. So, could that make the friend an agent of the company? I'm not sure. Agency usually involves some form of authority to act on behalf of the principal, which here is the company. But the clerk is an employee, and he asked his friend to watch the store. Does that mean the friend is acting as an agent? Probably not, because the clerk doesn't have the authority to appoint agents for the company. The company would need to have given the friend some form of authority, which doesn't seem to be the case here.

So, if the friend isn't an employee or an agent, then his actions wouldn't impute liability to the company. The company can't be held responsible for the friend's negligence because there's no employer-employee relationship. The friend was just a volunteer, like a Good Samaritan, trying to help but not acting on behalf of the company.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A says the company should have had a warning sign. But the problem doesn't mention anything about the machine being dangerous without a warning. It just says the friend gave wrong instructions. So maybe that's not the main issue here.

Option B states the company isn't liable for the friend's negligence. That makes sense because the friend isn't an employee. So this could be a possible correct answer.

Option C talks about vicarious liability for the man's actions. But the man didn't do anything wrong here—he was just using the bathroom. The issue is the friend's negligence, not the man's.

Option D suggests the customer should have waited. But legally, the customer has the right to use the facilities provided. If the machine was available for customers, she was entitled to use it, so the company might have some responsibility to ensure it's safe, but again, the friend's actions might not tie back to the company.

Option E says the friend was a Good Samaritan. I think that applies when someone voluntarily helps without expecting anything, which might apply here. If the friend was acting as a volunteer without any authority, the company isn't liable. So this could be another possible correct answer.

Option F says the man acted outside the scope by trusting his friend. But the man was just taking a short break and asked for help. I'm not sure if that's outside his job duties. It might not be the main issue.

Option G talks about training the man. The problem doesn't mention whether the man was properly trained on the machine. The friend's mistake was giving wrong instructions, not the man's training.

Option H says the friend wasn't an employee, so the company isn't liable. That aligns with what I was thinking earlier.

Option I is about ensuring the man isn't left alone. That's more about staffing, but the question is about the friend's actions, not the man's.

Option J suggests the friend's negligence is imputed to the company. But again, without an employer-employee relationship, that wouldn't apply.

So, narrowing it down, the key point is whether the friend's actions can be attributed to the company. Since the friend isn't an employee, the company isn't vicariously liable. So options B, E, H, and maybe F are in play.

Option E is about Good Samaritan. The Good Samaritan doctrine typically protects individuals from liability when they act in an emergency without expecting compensation. However, this situation isn't an emergency; the friend was just helping out. So maybe E isn't the best fit.

Option B says the company isn't liable because the friend's negligence isn't their responsibility. That seems accurate. The company can't be held liable for a non-employee's actions unless there's some other basis, like negligent supervision, but the question doesn't indicate that the company was negligent in how they supervised.

Wait, another thought: when the clerk asked the friend to watch the store, did that create an apparent authority? If the customer reasonably believed the friend was acting on behalf of the company, then the company might be liable. But in this case, the friend was just helping, and there's no indication that the customer thought the friend was an employee. So apparent authority might not apply here.

So, the company isn't liable because the friend isn't their employee, and they can't be held responsible for his negligence. So the correct answer is either B or H.

Looking at the options, option B says the company isn't liable because they're not responsible for the friend's negligence. Option H says the friend wasn't an employee, so the company isn't liable.

Which one is more precise? The reason is that the friend isn't an employee, so the company isn't liable. So H might be the better answer.

Wait, but option B is broader, stating the company isn't liable for the friend's negligence. Option H is more specific about the employment relationship.

In tort law, vicarious liability depends on the employment relationship. So if the friend is not an employee, there's no vicarious liability. So the customer wouldn't prevail because the friend isn't an employee (option H) or because the company isn't liable for the friend's negligence (option B).

Hmm. So which one is the correct reason? The company isn't liable because the friend isn't an employee. So option H is the reason.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option H says "not prevail, because the friend was not an employee of the coffee shop." So that's a direct reason. Option B is about the company not being liable for the friend's negligence, which is a result of the friend not being an employee.

So the correct answer is probably H.

The question revolves around whether the coffee shop company can be held liable for the customer's injury caused by the friend's negligence. The key legal issue is vicarious liability, which applies when an employer is responsible for the actions of an employee performed within the scope of employment. However, the friend is neither an employee nor an agent of the company. The clerk, as an employee, lacks the authority to appoint agents for the company, and the friend was merely a volunteer helping out.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: The absence of a warning sign is not the central issue, as the injury resulted from the friend's erroneous instructions, not an inherent danger of the machine.
- **Option B**: This correctly states that the company is not liable for the friend's negligence but does not specify the reason.
- **Option C**: Vicarious liability does not apply because the friend is not an employee, and the man did not act negligently.
- **Option D**: The customer had the right to use the machine, so this option is irrelevant.
- **Option E**: The "Good Samaritan" doctrine applies to emergencies, which is not the case here.
- **Option F**: The man did not act outside the scope of employment by asking his friend to watch the store temporarily.
- **Option G**: The man's training is irrelevant, as the injury resulted from the friend's actions.
- **Option H**: This is the most precise answer, as it directly addresses that the friend was not an employee, and thus the company cannot be held liable for his negligence.
- **Option I**: The company's staffing practices are not the issue here.
- **Option J**: The friend's negligence cannot be imputed to the company because he is not an employee.

The correct answer is **H**, as the friend's lack of employment status with the company is the primary reason the company is not liable for his actions.

**Answer: H**
