Question:

It is known that a lab cart is moving east at 25 cm/s at time t1 = 0.10 s, and then moving east at 15 cm/s at t2 = 0.20 s. Is this enough information to determine the direction of the net force acting on the cart between t1 and t2?

Options:

A: No, because we don’t know if there are other forces acting on the cart apart from the net force.
B: No, because we don’t know whether forces such as friction or air resistance might be acting on the cart.
C: No, because we don't know the initial velocity of the cart.
D: Yes, since we know the cart keeps moving to the east, the net force must be in the direction of motion.
E: Yes, because the cart is moving in the east direction, the net force must be acting in the east direction.
F: No, because we don’t know the total distance covered by the cart.
G: Yes, since we know the cart is slowing down, its momentum change is opposite the direction of movement, and the net force is in the direction of momentum change.
H: No, because we don’t know the mass of the cart.
I: Yes, because the cart's velocity is decreasing, the net force must be acting in the west direction.
J: Yes, since the cart is slowing down, the net force must be acting in the opposite direction to the direction of motion.

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. 

The question is about a lab cart moving east at a certain speed and then changing speed a bit later. The question is whether we have enough information to determine the direction of the net force acting on the cart between two specific times, t1 and t2.

So the cart is moving east at 25 cm/s at t1 = 0.10 seconds, and then it's moving east at 15 cm/s at t2 = 0.20 seconds. Hmm, wait, so it's moving in the same direction both times, but its speed is decreasing. Oh, right, because 15 is less than 25. So the cart is slowing down as it moves east.

I remember from physics that force is related to acceleration. Oh wait, Newton's second law: F = ma. Acceleration is the change in velocity over time. So if I can find the acceleration, I can figure out the direction of the net force because force and acceleration are in the same direction.

Let me think about the velocity change. The initial velocity at t1 is 25 cm/s east, and at t2 it's 15 cm/s east. So the change in velocity, delta v, is 15 - 25, which is -10 cm/s. The time between t1 and t2 is 0.20 - 0.10 = 0.10 seconds.

So acceleration a is delta v over delta t. That's -10 cm/s divided by 0.10 s. Which gives -100 cm/s². But wait, cm/s² isn't standard; usually, it's m/s². Oh, but the units here might not matter because direction is what's important.

The negative sign indicates that the acceleration is in the opposite direction of the velocity. Since the cart is moving east and the acceleration is negative, that means the acceleration is westward. Because in physics, the sign depends on the direction we choose as positive. If east is positive, then negative acceleration is west.

But wait, net force direction is same as acceleration. So if acceleration is west, the net force is west. So the cart is experiencing a net force opposite to its direction of motion, causing it to slow down.

So the question is, do we have enough information to determine this? Let's look at the options.

The options are A through J. I need to go through each to see which is correct.

Option A: No, because we don't know other forces. Well, Newton's laws talk about net force. If we can find the acceleration, net force is determined regardless of individual forces. So I don't think A is correct.

Option B: No, because we don't know about friction or air resistance. Well, but those are part of the net force. If the cart slows down, the net force is opposite, regardless of what specific forces cause it. So whether it's friction or something else, the net force is west. So B is saying we don't know, but I think we do, so B is incorrect.

Option C: No, because we don't know the initial velocity. Wait, wait. Wait, the initial velocity given is at t1, which is 25 cm/s. Oh, but initial in the overall problem context would be before t1? Hmm, but the question is about the time between t1 and t2, so initial velocity for that interval is 25, and final is 15. So I think we do have the velocities we need. So C is incorrect because we do know the velocities at t1 and t2.

Option D: Yes, because cart moves east and net force is same direction. Wait, no, because the cart is slowing down. So net force is opposite, so D is wrong.

Option E: Yes, because cart is moving east, net force must be east. That's not right because if it's slowing down, the net force is opposite. So E is incorrect.

Option F: No, because we don't know distance. Hmm, but distance isn't needed here. We have velocities and time, so we can find acceleration. So F is incorrect.

Option G: Yes, because cart is slowing, momentum change opposite direction, so net force same as momentum change. Wait, momentum is mass times velocity. The change in momentum is mass times delta v. So if velocity is decreasing (delta v negative), then change is negative, same direction as force. But the net force is causing the change, so F = delta p / delta t. So G is correct in that reasoning, but looking at the option, it says net force is in direction of momentum change. Wait, if cart is moving east, and velocity is decreasing, then delta v is west. So the net force is west. So G says the net force is in direction of momentum change, which is correct. So G is a possible correct answer.

Option H: No, because don't know mass. Well, since F = ma, but we don't need the magnitude, just direction. So mass doesn't matter for direction. H is incorrect.

Option I: Yes, because velocity is decreasing, net force west. Yes, that makes sense. So I is correct.

Option J: Yes, because slowing down, net force opposite direction. Correct, so J is right.

Wait, let me recheck. So the cart is moving east, velocity decreases. So acceleration is west. So net force is west. So the direction is opposite to motion.

So which options say that? Let's see.

Option I says yes, because velocity is decreasing, net force west. Yes.

Option J says yes, because cart is slowing down, net force opposite direction. Yes.

So both I and J seem correct. Wait, but let me look at the options again.

Looking back, option G says the net force is in the direction of momentum change. Since the cart is slowing, the change in momentum is opposite of velocity. So if velocity is east, delta p is west. So force is same as delta p direction. So G is correct.

Wait, but the question is about the direction of the net force. So multiple options could be correct, but looking at the options, perhaps I and J are correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, perhaps more than one is correct. But the options are presented as single choices, so perhaps only one is right.

Wait, let me re-examine the options:

Option G: "Yes, since we know the cart is slowing down, its momentum change is opposite the direction of movement, and the net force is in the direction of momentum change."

So that's correct. The momentum change is opposite, so net force is opposite.

Option I: "Yes, because the cart's velocity is decreasing, the net force must be acting in the west direction." That's correct.

Option J: "Yes, since the cart is slowing down, the net force must be acting in the opposite direction to the direction of motion." Correct.

So now, which of these are among the options? Let's look back.

The options for the answer are A to J.

So I have to pick which one is correct.

Wait, but perhaps only one is correct. Let me think again.

The key is: net force direction is same as acceleration, which is opposite to velocity (since slowing down). So net force is west.

So any option that says net force is west is correct.

Looking again:

Option I: Yes, net force west.

Option J: Yes, net force opposite to motion (i.e., west).

So both I and J are correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, the correct answer is either I or J.

Wait, the possible options are:

I: Yes, because the cart's velocity is decreasing, the net force must be acting west.

J: Yes, since the cart is slowing down, the net force must be opposite to direction of motion.

So both statements are correct. But the question is, which option is correct.

Wait, but perhaps I and J are both correct, but looking at the options, only one can be correct. So what's the actual correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in considering the options.

Wait, another approach: the question is if the information is enough. We have velocities at two times, so we can compute acceleration, and thus determine the direction of the net force.

So the answer should be yes, and the net force is west.

Looking at the options, the 'yes' options are D, E, G, I, J.

D says net force same as motion (east), which is wrong.

E same as D.

G: net force same as momentum change, which is west, so correct.

I: net force west, correct.

J: net force opposite direction, correct.

Wait, so among the options, G, I, J are correct.

But looking at the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option J. Because when the cart slows down, the acceleration is opposite to the direction of motion, so the net force is opposite.

Wait, but all of G, I, J are correct statements. But the question is which of the options correctly answers the question.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is J. Let me think again.

So the question is: Is this enough information to determine the direction of the net force between t1 and t2?

Yes, because from the velocities, we can find acceleration.

So the correct answer is yes, and the direction is west.

Which options say 'yes and west'? Let's look.

Option I: Yes, and net force west.

Option J: Yes, and net force opposite (west).

So both are correct. But the options are A to J, so perhaps the correct answers are I and J, but in the options, I and J are separate.

Wait, perhaps the question expects us to pick option J, as it's a more general statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is J.

But looking back, option G says the net force is in direction of momentum change. Since the cart is slowing, delta p is negative (assuming east is positive), so net force is west, same as delta p. So G is correct.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option J because it correctly states that the net force is opposite to the direction of motion, which is the case here.

So putting it all together, the correct answer is J.
</think>

To determine if there is enough information to find the direction of the net force acting on the cart between \( t_1 = 0.10 \, \text{s} \) and \( t_2 = 0.20 \, \text{s} \), we analyze the given data:

- At \( t_1 = 0.10 \, \text{s} \), the cart's velocity is \( v_1 = 25 \, \text{cm/s} \) east.
- At \( t_2 = 0.20 \, \text{s} \), the cart's velocity is \( v_2 = 15 \, \text{cm/s} \) east.

The cart is moving east, but its speed is decreasing, indicating it is slowing down. To find the direction of the net force, we calculate the acceleration:

\[
a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{v_2 - v_1}{t_2 - t_1} = \frac{15 - 25}{0.20 - 0.10} = \frac{-10}{0.10} = -100 \, \text{cm/s}^2
\]

The negative sign indicates that the acceleration is in the opposite direction of motion (west). Since the net force is in the same direction as the acceleration, the net force acting on the cart is west.

### Analysis of Options:
- **A**: Incorrect. The net force is already accounted for, regardless of other forces.
- **B**: Incorrect. Friction or air resistance are part of the net force, which is already determined.
- **C**: Incorrect. The velocities at \( t_1 \) and \( t_2 \) are given, so the initial velocity for this interval is known.
- **D**: Incorrect. The net force is not in the direction of motion; it is opposite.
- **E**: Incorrect. The net force is not in the direction of motion; it is opposite.
- **F**: Incorrect. Distance is not needed to determine the direction of the net force.
- **G**: Correct. The momentum change is opposite the direction of motion, and the net force is in the same direction as the momentum change (west).
- **H**: Incorrect. Mass is not needed to determine the direction of the net force.
- **I**: Correct. The cart's velocity is decreasing, so the net force is west.
- **J**: Correct. The cart is slowing down, so the net force is opposite to the direction of motion (west).

### Conclusion:
Multiple options (G, I, J) correctly describe the direction of the net force. However, the most general and concise explanation is provided by **J**, which directly states that the net force is opposite to the direction of motion.
