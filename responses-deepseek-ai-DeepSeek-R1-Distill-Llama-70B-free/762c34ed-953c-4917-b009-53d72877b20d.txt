Okay, so I've got this math problem here about finding all the cosets of the subgroup 4Z of 2Z. Hmm, I remember that cosets are like shifted versions of a subgroup within a larger group. Let's try to break this down.

First, I need to clarify what the groups are. 2Z is the set of all even integers, right? Like {..., -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, ...}. And 4Z is a subset of 2Z, since 4Z is {..., -8, -4, 0, 4, 8, ...}. So 4Z is a subgroup of 2Z because it's closed under addition and taking inverses.

Now, the question is asking for all the cosets of 4Z in 2Z. A coset is formed by taking an element of the group (here, 2Z) and adding it to every element of the subgroup (4Z). So each coset will look like a + 4Z, where 'a' is an element from 2Z.

Wait, but 2Z is the entire group, so we're looking for all possible cosets a + 4Z where a is in 2Z. But wait, since 4Z is a subgroup of 2Z, the cosets will partition 2Z into subsets.

I think the key here is to find the distinct cosets. Let's think about what elements are in 2Z but not in 4Z. For example, take 2. 2 is in 2Z but not in 4Z because 4Z only includes multiples of 4. So the coset starting with 2 would be 2 + 4Z, which includes {..., -6, -2, 2, 6, 10, ...}.

Wait, are there any other cosets? Let me see. 0 + 4Z is just 4Z itself. Then 2 + 4Z is another coset. But wait, 4Z is a subgroup, so when I add any even number to it, do I get another coset?

Wait, let me think about the elements of 2Z. They can be written as 2k where k is an integer. So the elements of 2Z are 0, ±2, ±4, ±6, etc. Now, when I take a coset a + 4Z, 'a' is an element of 2Z. So 'a' can be 0, 2, 4, 6, etc.

But if I add 4 to 4Z, that's the same as 4Z itself because 4 is in 4Z. So 4 + 4Z = 4Z. Similarly, 8 +4Z is also 4Z. So the only distinct cosets are when 'a' is in the same equivalence class modulo 4Z. So perhaps the distinct cosets are 4Z and 2 + 4Z.

Wait, let me test this. Let's take a=0: 0 +4Z=4Z. a=2: 2+4Z. a=4: 4+4Z=4Z. a=6:6+4Z=2+4Z (since 6=4+2, so 6+4Z=2 +4Z +4Z=2+4Z). So for any even number, adding 4Z will either give 4Z or 2+4Z.

So the cosets are 4Z and 2+4Z. So the set of cosets has two elements: the subgroup itself and the coset with 2 added.

Looking back at the options, let's see which one matches this. Option G is 4Z and 2 +4Z. Option A is only 4Z, which can't be right because there's another coset. Option J includes 1 +4Z, but 1 isn't in 2Z, so that can't be a coset here because the group is 2Z. So the correct answer should have exactly two cosets: 4Z and 2+4Z.

So the correct option is G.

To determine the cosets of the subgroup \(4\mathbb{Z}\) within the group \(2\mathbb{Z}\), we start by noting that \(2\mathbb{Z}\) consists of all even integers (\(0, \pm 2, \pm 4, \pm 6, \dots\)), and \(4\mathbb{Z}\) is a subgroup of \(2\mathbb{Z}\) containing multiples of 4 (\(0, \pm 4, \pm 8, \dots\)).

A coset of \(4\mathbb{Z}\) in \(2\mathbb{Z}\) is of the form \(a + 4\mathbb{Z}\), where \(a \in 2\mathbb{Z}\). To find all distinct cosets, we consider the elements of \(2\mathbb{Z}\) and how they interact with \(4\mathbb{Z}\):

1. **When \(a = 0\):** The coset is \(0 + 4\mathbb{Z} = 4\mathbb{Z}\), which is the subgroup itself.
2. **When \(a = 2\):** The coset is \(2 + 4\mathbb{Z}\), which includes all integers of the form \(2 + 4k\) (\(k \in \mathbb{Z}\)), such as \(\dots, -6, -2, 2, 6, 10, \dots\).
3. **When \(a = 4\):** The coset is \(4 + 4\mathbb{Z} = 4\mathbb{Z}\), which is the same as the subgroup.
4. **When \(a = 6\):** The coset is \(6 + 4\mathbb{Z} = 2 + 4\mathbb{Z}\), which is the same as the coset when \(a = 2\).

From this, we see that the distinct cosets of \(4\mathbb{Z}\) in \(2\mathbb{Z}\) are \(4\mathbb{Z}\) and \(2 + 4\mathbb{Z}\). These two cosets partition \(2\mathbb{Z}\).

Analyzing the options:
- **Option A:** Only \(4\mathbb{Z}\), which is incomplete.
- **Option B:** \(2\mathbb{Z}\), which is the entire group, not the cosets.
- **Option C:** \(4\mathbb{Z}, 1 + 4\mathbb{Z}\), but \(1 \notin 2\mathbb{Z}\), so this is invalid.
- **Option D:** \(2\mathbb{Z}\), which is the entire group, not the cosets.
- **Option E:** \(4\mathbb{Z}, 1 + 4\mathbb{Z}\), same issue as Option C.
- **Option F:** \(2\mathbb{Z}, 4 + 2\mathbb{Z}\), incorrect as it does not represent the cosets of \(4\mathbb{Z}\).
- **Option G:** \(4\mathbb{Z}, 2 + 4\mathbb{Z}\), which matches the distinct cosets.
- **Option H:** \(2\mathbb{Z}, 1 + 2\mathbb{Z}, 2 + 2\mathbb{Z}\), incorrect as it does not represent the cosets of \(4\mathbb{Z}\).
- **Option I:** \(4\mathbb{Z}, 2 + 4\mathbb{Z}, 6 + 4\mathbb{Z}\), but \(6 + 4\mathbb{Z} = 2 + 4\mathbb{Z}\), so this is redundant.
- **Option J:** \(4\mathbb{Z}, 2 + 4\mathbb{Z}, 1 + 4\mathbb{Z}\), but \(1 \notin 2\mathbb{Z}\), so this is invalid.

The correct answer is **Option G**, as it accurately lists the two distinct cosets of \(4\mathbb{Z}\) in \(2\mathbb{Z}\): \(4\mathbb{Z}\) and \(2 + 4\mathbb{Z}\).
