Okay, so I have this physics problem here, and I need to figure out the answer. Let's see what it's about. The question says an eastbound car travels a distance of 40 meters in 5 seconds, and I need to determine the speed of the car. The options are given from A to J, each with different values. 

Hmm, right, speed is generally calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time taken. Oh wait, speed equals distance over time. Yeah, that's the formula I remember from school. So in this case, the distance is 40 meters, and the time is 5 seconds. 

Let me write that down. So speed (v) equals distance (d) divided by time (t). So v = d/t. Substituting the numbers here, d is 40 m and t is 5 s. So that would be 40 divided by 5. 

Wait, what's 40 divided by 5? Let me do the math. 5 times 8 is 40, right? So 40 divided by 5 is 8. So that would mean the speed is 8 meters per second. 

Looking at the options, I need to find which option corresponds to 8 m/s. Let me check each option. Option A is 12 m/s, that's too high. B is 11, also high. C is 10, still higher than 8. D is 16, way higher. E is 6, which is lower. F is 9, which is higher. G is 7.5, which is close but not exactly 8. H is 8 m/s, that's the one I calculated. I is 5, which is lower, and J is 14, higher than needed. 

So the correct answer should be option H: 8 m/s. 

Wait, but just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Did I use the right formula? Yes, speed is distance over time. Did I plug the numbers correctly? 40 divided by 5 is 8. Yeah, that seems right. So I think I'm confident that H is the correct answer.

The speed of the car is calculated using the formula \( v = \frac{d}{t} \), where \( d = 40 \, \text{m} \) and \( t = 5 \, \text{s} \). Substituting these values gives:

\[
v = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

Among the provided options, the value \( 8 \, \text{m/s} \) corresponds to option H. 

Answer: H
