Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this archaeology question. The question is about how archaeologists characterize the people who built monumental structures at Göbekli Tepe, Watson Brake, and Poverty Point. The options are A through J, but I'm focusing on the ones given here.

First, I need to recall what I know about these sites. Göbekli Tepe is in Turkey, right? I remember it's one of the oldest examples of monumental architecture, dating back to like 10,000 years ago. The people who built it were hunter-gatherers, I think, because it's before the Neolithic Revolution when agriculture became widespread. So they weren't farmers yet.

Watson Brake is in Louisiana, USA. If I remember correctly, it's a site with several mounds arranged in a circle. I think it was built by people who were still hunter-gatherers too, maybe around 5,000 years ago. They didn't have agriculture as far as I know.

Poverty Point is another site in the southern United States. It's famous for its large earthworks, constructed around 3,700 to 3,100 years ago. The people there were likely hunter-gatherers as well. They didn't domesticate plants on a large scale, so not agriculturalists.

Wait, but some sources might say Poverty Point people were in the Archaic period and perhaps had some early forms of cultivation, but I don't think they were fully agricultural. So all three sites were built by pre-agricultural societies.

Now, looking at the options. Option B is agriculturalists, but that doesn't fit because these people were before that. Option A is early pastoralists, which also relates to herding, but again, that's after the initial hunter-gatherer phase.

Option D is affluent foragers. I've heard the term "affluent foragers" used to describe hunter-gatherers who had a rich resource base, allowing them to build more complex societies. Since these sites have monumental structures, it suggests a level of organization and possibly surplus, which fits with affluent foragers.

Option I is nomadic tribes, but I think these people might have been more sedentary, at least seasonally, to build such structures. So that might not fit.

So putting it together, the characterization would be as affluent foragers, which is option D.

The peoples who built the monumental structures at Göbekli Tepe, Watson Brake, and Poverty Point are characterized as affluent foragers. These sites were constructed by pre-agricultural societies, primarily hunter-gatherers, who likely had access to abundant resources that allowed for the organization and labor required to build such structures. This aligns with the concept of "affluent foragers," who had a rich resource base enabling more complex social structures.

Answer: D
