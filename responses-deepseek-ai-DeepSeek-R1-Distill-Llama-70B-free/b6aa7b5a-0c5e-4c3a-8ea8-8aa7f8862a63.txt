Question:

A woman hired a builder to build a house according to certain plans and specifications prepared by the woman's architect. The agreed upon price was $250,000, with construction to be completed within four months. Two weeks after the building contract was formed, the builder contacted a lumber yard to purchase wood necessary for the construction of the house. The builder and the owner of the lumber yard entered into a valid written agreement whereby the lumber yard was to supply the necessary lumber in exchange for $10,000, payable by the builder within 30 days. One week later, a fire destroyed a good portion of the lumber yard's supply of lumber. As a result, the lumber yard refused to supply lumber to the builder. The builder was unable to find another supplier of lumber and therefore notified the woman that he would be unable to complete her building on time. If the woman sues the owner of the lumber yard for breach of contract, will she prevail?

Options:

A: Yes, because the builder's inability to complete the building due to the lumber yard's breach of contract directly affected the woman.
B: Yes, but only if the builder's contract with the owner of the lumber yard was not discharged by the fire.
C: Yes, but only if the woman had made an advance payment to the builder.
D: No, because privity of contract does not exist between the woman and the owner of the lumber yard.
E: No, because the builder did not notify the woman immediately after the fire at the lumber yard.
F: Yes, if the woman can prove that the lumber yard's refusal to supply lumber was the sole reason for the delay in construction.
G: Yes, because by operation of law the woman is an equitable assignee of the builder's claim against the owner of the lumber yard for breach of contract.
H: No, because the woman did not have a direct contract with the lumber yard, so she cannot sue for breach of contract.
I: No, because the fire was an act of nature and the lumber yard had no control over it.
J: No, because the woman is only an incidental beneficiary of the contract between the builder and the owner of the lumber yard.

Okay, so I have this contract law question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it carefully.

So, there's a woman who hired a builder to build a house according to specific plans. The price was $250,000, and the construction was supposed to be done in four months. Two weeks after the contract was made, the builder contacted a lumber yard to buy the necessary wood. They made a written agreement where the lumber yard would supply the lumber for $10,000, payable by the builder within 30 days.

Then, a week later, a fire destroyed a lot of the lumber yard's supply. Because of this, the lumber yard refused to supply the lumber to the builder. The builder couldn't find another supplier and told the woman he couldn't finish the house on time. Now, the woman is suing the lumber yard owner for breach of contract. The question is whether she'll prevail.

Hmm. So the main issue here is whether the woman can sue the lumber yard directly. I remember that in contract law, the concept of privity of contract is important. Privity means that only parties to the contract can enforce it. So, the woman didn't have a direct contract with the lumber yard; she had one with the builder. The builder had a separate contract with the lumber yard.

Wait, but could the woman be a third-party beneficiary? There are two types: intended and incidental. An intended beneficiary can sue if the contract was made with the intent to benefit them. But in this case, the builder contracted with the lumber yard to get materials for the woman's house. So, the woman is likely an intended third-party beneficiary because the lumber was specifically for her project.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The builder's contract with the lumber yard was to supply materials necessary for the woman's house. So the purpose was to fulfill the builder's obligation to the woman. That would make the woman an intended beneficiary because the contract between builder and lumber yard was intended to benefit her.

However, there's a possibility that the lumber yard's breach affects the builder, not the woman directly. The woman's contract is with the builder, so if the builder can't perform because the lumber yard didn't supply, maybe the woman can sue the builder for breach. But the question is whether she can sue the lumber yard.

Wait, the woman is suing the lumber yard, not the builder. So the issue is whether she has standing to sue the lumber yard. Without privity, she can't unless she's an intended third-party beneficiary.

Another point is that sometimes, even if you're a beneficiary, if the contract doesn't explicitly state that you can enforce it, you might not be able to. But in many jurisdictions, if you're an intended beneficiary, you can enforce the contract.

Wait, but let me think about the options. Option J says no because she's an incidental beneficiary. Incidental beneficiaries can't sue. So the question is whether she's incidental or intended.

How do I determine that? The test is whether the parties intended the beneficiary to benefit from the contract. Here, the lumber yard knew the materials were for the woman's house, right? Because the builder was using them for her project. So the lumber yard and the builder intended for the lumber to go into the woman's house, making her an intended beneficiary.

So, if that's the case, she should be able to sue the lumber yard for breach of contract. But wait, I'm remembering that sometimes, even if you're an intended beneficiary, the parties can change the contract or discharge the duty without your consent, but that's more about when the original parties modify the contract.

Alternatively, maybe the fire is an act of God, so the lumber yard might have a defense under force majeure. But the question doesn't give any details about the contract between builder and lumber yard having such a clause. So without that, the lumber yard's failure would be a breach.

Wait, but the question is about whether the woman can sue the lumber yard. So if she's an intended beneficiary, she can. But looking at the options, option J says no because she's an incidental beneficiary. So I'm a bit torn.

Wait, another angle: sometimes, when a subcontractor like the lumber yard is involved, the owner (woman) can't sue the subcontractor directly unless there's privity or unless they're an intended beneficiary. But in this scenario, the builder and lumber yard's contract was made after the main contract, and specifically for the woman's project. So the intent was there.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me look at the options again.

Option D says no because there's no privity between the woman and lumber yard. That's correct in the sense that they didn't have a direct contract. But if she's a third-party beneficiary, she can sue despite the lack of privity.

Option J says no because she's an incidental beneficiary. So which is it?

So, the test for intended beneficiary is: did the parties to the contract (builder and lumber yard) have the intent to make the promise for the beneficiary's (woman's) benefit? If yes, then she's intended and can sue.

In this case, the lumber yard was supplying materials for the builder's project—the woman's house. So the intent was that the lumber yard's performance would directly benefit the woman. Therefore, she's an intended beneficiary, not incidental.

So option J would be incorrect. Therefore, the answer would be that she can sue, so looking for options that say yes.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Yes, because the builder's inability to complete directly affected her. But this reasoning might be too simplistic. The real issue is whether she's a beneficiary.

Option G: Yes, because she's an equitable assignee by operation of law. Wait, assignment is different from third-party beneficiary. An assignment would require the builder to assign the right to her, which isn't the case here. So G is about assignment, which isn't applicable.

Option B: Yes, but only if the contract wasn't discharged by the fire. Hmm, the fire destroyed the lumber, so perhaps the lumber yard's contract with the builder was discharged by impossibility or frustration. If that's the case, the lumber yard isn't in breach because they were unable to perform. But the question states that the lumber yard refused to supply after the fire. So, is impossibility a valid defense here?

Wait, the fire was an unforeseen event. So, under contract law, if performance becomes impossible without fault of the parties, the contract may be discharged. So the lumber yard might argue that they can't supply because of the fire, making it impossible, so no breach. But sometimes, if a supplier has other sources, they might still be liable. The question says the lumber yard had a good portion destroyed, but maybe they could have gotten more from elsewhere. Alternatively, the contract might have a force majeure clause, but the question doesn't mention that.

But the question is whether the woman can sue the lumber yard. If the lumber yard is in breach, then yes, but if the contract was discharged due to impossibility, then no breach. So if the contract between builder and lumber yard was discharged, then there's no breach, and the woman can't sue.

Wait, but the question is whether the woman can sue the lumber yard for breach of contract. So if the lumber yard's failure was due to impossibility, they might not be liable. But the question says the lumber yard refused to supply. So perhaps they just refused, not that it was impossible. Wait, no—the fire destroyed their supply, so they couldn't supply, hence refused. So maybe it's impossibility, which would discharge their obligation.

But the question states that the lumber yard refused to supply as a result of the fire. So, perhaps the lumber yard's obligation was discharged because of the fire, making their refusal justified. Therefore, no breach, and the woman can't sue.

Wait, but if the lumber yard had other sources or could have obtained lumber elsewhere, then their inability might not be a defense. But the question doesn't specify that. It just says a fire destroyed a good portion of their supply. So perhaps they couldn't perform, so no breach.

If that's the case, then the lumber yard didn't breach the contract, so the woman can't sue them. So the answer would be no, because the fire made it impossible, so no breach.

Wait, but the question is whether the woman can sue the lumber yard for breach. So if the lumber yard's non-performance was due to impossibility, then no breach. So the answer would be no.

But I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let's recap.

1. Woman contracts with Builder to build a house.

2. Builder contracts with Lumber Yard for materials.

3. Fire destroys Lumber Yard's supply; they refuse to deliver.

4. Builder can't complete on time, tells Woman.

5. Woman sues Lumber Yard.

Issue: Can Woman sue Lumber Yard?

- Privity: No direct contract, so unless she's a third-party beneficiary.

- Third-party beneficiary: She's likely intended, but if the contract between Builder and Lumber Yard was discharged due to impossibility, then there's no breach.

So, to determine if she can sue, two things must be true:

a) She's an intended beneficiary.

b) The Lumber Yard is in breach, i.e., their failure wasn't due to impossibility.

If the fire made it impossible for Lumber Yard to perform, then no breach. Therefore, no liability to the Builder, so the Builder can't sue, and the Woman, as a beneficiary, can't either.

But wait, the Builder might have a claim against the Lumber Yard only if the impossibility isn't a valid defense. If the Lumber Yard's supply was destroyed, and they couldn't reasonably get more lumber, then it's impossibility, so no breach.

In that case, the Builder can't sue the Lumber Yard, and the Woman, as a beneficiary, can't either.

So, going back to the options:

Option J says no because she's an incidental beneficiary. But I thought she was intended.

Wait, perhaps the answer hinges on whether she's an intended beneficiary. If she's only incidental, then she can't sue.

But in this case, the Builder's purpose in contracting with the Lumber Yard was to get materials for the Woman's house. So the Lumber Yard knew that the materials were for the Woman. Therefore, the intent was to benefit her, making her an intended beneficiary.

So if she's intended, she can sue, unless the Lumber Yard's breach is excused.

So, if the Lumber Yard's non-performance was due to impossibility, then no breach, so she can't sue.

But the question doesn't specify whether the contract between Builder and Lumber Yard included any exceptions for impossibility. If it didn't, then under common law, if performance is impossible, the obligation is discharged.

So, the fire made it impossible, so the Lumber Yard isn't in breach. Thus, the Builder can't recover from them, and the Woman, as a beneficiary, can't either.

Therefore, the answer would be no, the Woman can't sue the Lumber Yard.

Wait, but looking at the options, option I says no because the fire was an act of nature beyond their control. So that would align with the impossibility defense.

But the question is about whether the Woman can sue the Lumber Yard. So if the Lumber Yard isn't liable because of impossibility, then the Woman can't sue.

So the answer would be no, and the correct option would be either I or J.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Option J: No, because she's only an incidental beneficiary.

Option I: No, because the fire was an act of nature.

So, is the reason impossibility (I), or is it because she's an incidental beneficiary (J)?

I think the better answer is J because the main issue is standing. Even if the Lumber Yard is in breach, if the Woman isn't a beneficiary, she can't sue.

Wait, but if she's an intended beneficiary, then she can. So in that case, the answer would be yes, but only if the Lumber Yard is in breach.

But if the Lumber Yard's performance was impossible, then no breach, so she can't sue regardless of being a beneficiary.

Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, the main issue is whether she can sue at all, regardless of the breach.

If she's not a party to the contract, she can't sue unless she's a third-party beneficiary.

So, the initial question is whether she's a third-party beneficiary.

In this case, she is intended, so she should be able to sue, but only if the Lumber Yard is in breach.

But if the Lumber Yard's failure was due to impossibility, then no breach.

So, the answer would be no because the Lumber Yard's obligation was discharged, making option I the correct answer.

Wait, but the question is whether the Woman can sue for breach, so if there's no breach, she can't.

So, the answer is no, and the reason is that the Lumber Yard wasn't in breach because of impossibility.

But looking at the options, option I says that.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: the woman is suing the lumber yard for breach of contract. The question is whether she can prevail.

The elements are: (1) a contract, (2) breach, (3) causation, (4) damages.

But she wasn't a party to the contract, so unless she's a third-party beneficiary, she can't sue.

So if she's an intended beneficiary, she can. But if she's only incidental, she can't.

In this scenario, the contract between Builder and Lumber Yard was made to fulfill the Builder's obligation to the Woman. Thus, she's an intended beneficiary.

Therefore, she can sue if there's a breach.

But if the Lumber Yard's failure was due to impossibility, then there's no breach, so she can't recover.

But the question doesn't specify whether the contract between Builder and Lumber Yard included a clause about unforeseen events. If not, then under common law, impossibility would discharge the contract.

So, the Lumber Yard isn't in breach, so the Woman can't sue.

Wait, but the question says the Lumber Yard refused to supply. So, perhaps they just refused, not that it was impossible. But the reason for refusal was the fire. So, maybe the Lumber Yard could have obtained lumber elsewhere, or maybe not.

If the fire made it impossible, then refusal is justified. If not, then it's a breach.

But without more info, perhaps we have to assume that the fire made it impossible, so the Lumber Yard isn't liable.

So, the Woman can't sue because there's no breach.

So the answer would be no, and the correct option is either I or J.

But the main issue is standing. If she's a third-party beneficiary, she can sue if there's a breach. But if there's no breach, she can't.

So, the answer depends on whether the Lumber Yard's failure was a breach or not.

If the fire made it impossible, then no breach, so she can't sue. So the answer is no, and the reason is impossibility, which is option I.

But another angle: even if she's an intended beneficiary, if the contract between Builder and Lumber Yard was discharged, then there's nothing for her to sue on.

So, the answer is no, and the reason is either impossibility (I) or lack of privity (D, H, J).

Wait, but privity is about standing. If she's a third-party beneficiary, she has standing regardless of privity.

So, the correct reasoning is that she can't sue because the Lumber Yard's performance was impossible, so no breach. Therefore, the answer is no, and the correct option is I.

Wait, but option J is about being an incidental beneficiary. If she's intended, then J is wrong, but if she's incidental, then J is correct.

But I thought she was intended because the Builder's contract with the Lumber Yard was specifically for her project.

Hmm. Maybe the answer is J because the Lumber Yard's contract with the Builder didn't intend to benefit the Woman directly. Wait, no, the Builder needed the lumber to build her house, so the intent was there.

Alternatively, maybe the Builder's contract with the Lumber Yard was for the Builder's own purposes, and the Woman is just an incidental beneficiary.

Wait, but the Builder's purpose in getting the lumber was to fulfill his contract with the Woman. So the Lumber Yard knew that their performance would directly affect the Woman. So she's an intended beneficiary.

Therefore, she can sue if the Lumber Yard breached. But if the Lumber Yard's obligation was discharged due to impossibility, then no breach, so she can't sue.

So the answer is no because the Lumber Yard's obligation was discharged, making option I correct.

But I'm a bit stuck between options I and J.

Alternatively, if the question is testing on third-party beneficiary status, the answer would be J if she's incidental, but I think she's intended.

Wait, another way: the contract between Builder and Lumber Yard is to supply materials for a house the Builder is building. The Lumber Yard's performance is not directly to the Woman, so she's an incidental beneficiary.

No, that doesn't make sense. The Builder is using the lumber for the Woman's house, so the Lumber Yard's performance is intended to benefit her.

Wait, perhaps the answer is J because the Lumber Yard's contract was with the Builder, and the Woman is only an incidental beneficiary, meaning she can't sue.

But I'm not sure. I think the correct answer is J, but I'm torn.

Wait, let me think about the Restatement (Second) of Contracts §302. It says that a beneficiary can recover if the contract was intended to benefit them. The intent is determined by whether the promisee (Builder) and promisor (Lumber Yard) intended the beneficiary (Woman) to benefit.

In this case, the Builder contracted for lumber for the Woman's house, so the intent was there. Therefore, she's an intended beneficiary, so she can sue if there's a breach.

But if the Lumber Yard's performance was impossible, then no breach, so she can't sue. So the answer would be no because the Lumber Yard isn't liable due to impossibility. That would make option I correct.

But the question is about whether the Woman can sue the Lumber Yard. So, two possible reasons why she can't: either she's not a beneficiary, or there's no breach.

If she's a beneficiary but there's no breach, then she can't sue. So the answer would be no because of impossibility, making option I correct.

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, some might argue that the fire doesn't make it impossible because the Lumber Yard could have sourced lumber elsewhere. But the question says a good portion was destroyed, implying they couldn't supply, making it impossible.

So, putting it all together, the answer is no because the Lumber Yard's obligation was discharged due to impossibility, so option I.

Wait, but the question says the lumber yard refused to supply. So maybe they chose not to perform, which would be a breach, but
