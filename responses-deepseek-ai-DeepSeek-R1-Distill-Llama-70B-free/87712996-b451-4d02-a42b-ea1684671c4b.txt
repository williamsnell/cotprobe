Okay, so I've got this question about Mayan kings and their symbols on stelae. Hmm, I remember that stelae were these stone monuments that the Maya used to record important events, like the reigns of kings, their achievements, and sometimes their divine connections.

The question is about Yax Pahsaj and what his stele depicts. The options are A through J. I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I'll think about what each option is suggesting. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Military conquests. I know that some Maya stelae do show military victories, like capturing enemies or battles. But I'm not sure if Yax Pahsaj is specifically known for that. I'll keep this in mind but not jump to conclusions yet.

Option B: Corn god symbol. The corn god is a big deal in Maya mythology, associated with fertility and prosperity. Kings often linked themselves to such deities. Maybe Yax Pahsaj is depicted as the corn god to emphasize his role in bringing abundance to his people.

Option C: Hunting jaguar. Jaguars were important animals in Maya culture, often symbols of power and kingship. If the stele shows him defeating a jaguar, that could signify strength. But I'm not sure if this is a common theme for Yax Pahsaj specifically.

Option D: Eagle, serpent, jaguar. These are indeed important animals. The jaguar especially was a major symbol. But does the stele depict all three together? I'm not certain.

Option E: Receiving crown from god of death and rebirth. The god of death and rebirth might be someone like Ah Puch or Kisin. If the king is getting a crown from a god, it would show divine legitimacy. That sounds plausible because Maya kings often claimed divine right.

Option F: Coronation with gods as witnesses. Similar to E, but more about the ceremony. I think coronation scenes do appear on stelae, but I'm not sure which king specifically.

Option G: Lightning bolt from heaven. Lightning could symbolize divine power, maybe from the storm god. But I don't recall this being a common motif for Mayan kings' stelae.

Option H: Sun symbol, son of Sun God. The sun was a significant symbol, and kings often claimed descent from gods. But I'm not sure if Yax Pahsaj's stele specifically shows a sun.

Option I: Founder passing the torch. This sounds like a transfer of power. Maybe the stele shows the founder giving him authority, which would legitimize his rule.

Option J: Standing on a mountain peak. Mountains could symbolize power and elevation, both literally and metaphorically. But again, not sure if this is accurate for Yax Pahsaj.

Now, I'm trying to remember specific details about Yax Pahsaj. I think he was a king of Tikal, one of the major Maya cities. From what I recall, Maya kings often depicted themselves in scenes that emphasized their divine right and connection to the gods.

One common theme is the king being presented as a divine figure, sometimes receiving symbols of office from a god. For example, the coronation might involve the king receiving a crown or a scepter from a deity, which would legitimize his rule.

Looking back at the options, E says he's receiving a crown from the Mayan god of death and rebirth. That could be a way to show he's got divine authority. Alternatively, option F mentions a coronation with gods as witnesses, which is similar but more about the ceremony including multiple gods.

Wait, another thought: some stelae show the king in the presence of the gods, perhaps with a god handing him something. I think I've heard that the coronation scenes often include the king receiving symbols of power from a god. So maybe E is correct, where he's getting the crown from the god of death and rebirth.

But I'm a bit fuzzy on which god exactly would be involved. The god of death and rebirth might not be the one typically associated with coronation. Maybe it's more about creation or the sun. Hmm.

Alternatively, the corn god, as in option B, is a major deity. If the king is depicted as the corn god, it would tie him to fertility and the cycles of nature, which would be good for the kingdom's prosperity.

Wait, I think I remember that some Maya kings were depicted as the corn god, especially in the context of resurrection and fertility. The corn god's story includes death and rebirth, which mirrors the king's role in ensuring the land's fertility and the people's survival.

So if Yax Pahsaj's stele shows him as the corn god, that would symbolize his role in bringing prosperity. That would make option B correct.

But I'm a bit confused now. Another approach: what do I know about specific stelae? For example, the famous Stela 31 from Tikal, which is about Yax Pahsaj. Wait, I think that's the one. I recall that Stela 31 shows him performing a ritual dance and possibly being associated with the corn god.

Wait, no, maybe it's another king. Alternatively, I think some stelae depict the king with a crown that has the image of the corn god. Or perhaps the king is shown in the guise of the corn god.

Alternatively, the coronation could involve the king receiving a crown from a god, which would make option E correct. But I'm not entirely sure.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think of what the question is asking: the stele symbolizes his royalty. So the depiction is about his kingship, his divine right.

Option E is about receiving a crown from the god of death and rebirth. The god of death and rebirth is likely to be associated with the underworld, maybe like the god Kisin or Ah Puch. But coronation might be more likely to involve a sky god or the sun god.

Option F is about the coronation with all the Mayan gods as witnesses. That sounds plausible because having the gods present would legitimize the king's rule.

Wait, I think that in some stelae, the king is shown with a group of gods around him, perhaps in a coronation scene. But I'm not certain if that's the case with Yax Pahsaj.

Alternatively, the depiction of the king as a corn god (option B) would tie into themes of fertility and the king's role in ensuring agricultural success. The corn god is also associated with resurrection, which could tie into the king's divine right to rule.

So, putting it all together, I'm a bit torn between options B and E. But I think I've read that Maya kings often depicted themselves in the image of the corn god, especially in the context of rituals and symbolic representations of their power.

Therefore, I'm leaning towards option B: a depiction of him as a corn god, symbol of fertility and prosperity.

The question asks about the depiction on the stele of the Mayan king Yax Pahsaj, which symbolizes his royalty. To determine the correct answer, each option is analyzed in the context of Mayan cultural and historical knowledge.

Option A suggests military conquests, which were sometimes depicted on stelae, but there is no specific evidence linking this to Yax Pahsaj. Option B proposes a depiction of Yax Pahsaj as the corn god, which aligns with the importance of fertility and prosperity in Maya culture, as well as the king's role in ensuring agricultural success. Option C involves hunting a jaguar, a symbol of power, but this is not specifically tied to Yax Pahsaj. Option D mentions three important animals, but there is no clear evidence that all three were depicted together on his stele. Option E suggests the king receiving a crown from the god of death and rebirth, which could symbolize divine legitimacy, but the god of death and rebirth may not typically be associated with coronation. Option F involves a coronation ceremony with gods as witnesses, which is plausible but not definitively linked to Yax Pahsaj. Option G, a lightning bolt, is not a common motif for Mayan kings. Option H, a sun symbol, could represent divine descent but lacks specificity. Option I, passing the torch, implies a transfer of power but is not clearly tied to Yax Pahsaj. Option J, standing on a mountain, symbolizes power but is not specific to his stele.

Given the analysis, Option B is the most plausible. Maya kings often depicted themselves as the corn god to emphasize their role in fertility and prosperity, which aligns with Yax Pahsaj's stele. This depiction would symbolize his divine connection and role in ensuring the kingdom's success.
