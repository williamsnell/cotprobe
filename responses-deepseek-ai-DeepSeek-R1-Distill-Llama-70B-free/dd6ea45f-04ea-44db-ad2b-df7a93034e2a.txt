The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

The state registrar of elections refused to put a candidate's name on the ballot because the registrar believed that the candidate was not a resident of the state. The registrar contended that Article I, Section 2 of the U. S. Constitution specifically required a candidate for the House of Representatives "be an Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen. " As a consequence, the candidate filed suit in state court against the registrar of elections seeking to have her name placed on the ballot. The state court ruled in her favor and determined that the candidate did, in fact, qualify as a resident of the state. The registrar appealed the decision to the state supreme court which, in turn, affirmed the lower court ruling. Thereafter, the candidate's name was placed on the ballot. After a hotly contested election, the candidate narrowly defeated the incumbent. However, at the time that the candidate was to be seated as a House member, the House of Representatives held hearings on her qualifications and eligibility. By a two-thirds vote, the House determined that the candidate was not a resident of the state at the time of her election and refused to seat her. The candidate then brought suit in federal district court against the Speaker and other officers of the House, seeking back pay and an order that she be seated in the House of Representatives. The defendants demurred, claiming lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Which of the following is the strongest constitutional argument supporting the defendants' demurrer?

Options:

A: The suit should have been brought as an original action in the U. S. Supreme Court.
B: The federal court cannot intervene because it would disrupt the separation of powers.
C: Under Article III of the Constitution, the federal courts are not empowered to render advisory opinions.
D: The candidate lacks standing to sue because she was never officially a member of the House of Representatives.
E: The case should have been filed in the state court where the original residency determination was made.
F: The federal court lacks jurisdiction because the House of Representatives has exclusive authority to determine the qualifications of its members.
G: The case is moot because the term of office for which the candidate was elected has already ended.
H: There is no case or controversy between the candidate and the officers of the House of Representatives.
I: The candidate's claims are barred by the Eleventh Amendment.
J: The case presents a nonjusticiable political question.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the answer to this constitutional law question. Let me read through it carefully and break it down step by step.

The scenario is about a candidate for the House of Representatives who was initially denied a spot on the ballot by the state registrar because of a residency issue. The candidate sued in state court, won, got on the ballot, and then won the election. But when she tried to be seated, the House of Representatives refused her, saying she didn't meet the residency requirement. Now she's suing in federal court for back pay and to be seated. The defendants, the Speaker and others, are claiming the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction.

The question is asking which constitutional argument supports the defendants' claim. The options are A through J, each presenting a different legal principle.

First, I need to recall the relevant constitutional provisions. The House of Representatives has the authority to determine the qualifications of its members under Article I, Section 5. It says each House shall be the judge of the qualifications of its own members. So that might be the key point here.

Now, the candidate is suing in federal court, but the defendants are arguing lack of jurisdiction. So the issue is whether federal courts have the authority to hear this case.

I remember that in the case of Powell v. McCormack, the Supreme Court ruled that while each House has the authority to decide qualifications, this doesn't extend to constitutional qualifications like age, citizenship, and residency. So Congress can't add additional qualifications beyond what the Constitution specifies. But in this case, the issue is residency, which is a constitutional qualification.

Wait, but the House is refusing to seat her based on her residency, which is within their constitutional authority. So does that mean that federal courts can't interfere with that decision?

Another point is the concept of political questions. Some matters are considered political questions that the judiciary cannot decide because they're committed to another branch of government by the Constitution. For example, the Supreme Court has held that the Constitution gives the House the sole power to judge the qualifications of its members, and this is a political question not reviewable by courts.

So, if the House's decision is a political question, then the federal court lacks jurisdiction to hear the case because it's nonjusticiable. That would mean the court can't decide the issue, so the case should be dismissed.

Looking at the options, option J says the case presents a nonjusticiable political question. That seems to fit because the Constitution assigns this power to the House, making it a political question for the courts to avoid.

Alternatively, option F says the federal court lacks jurisdiction because the House has exclusive authority. While that's true in a sense, the reason for lack of jurisdiction is more about the political question doctrine, which is a constitutional allocation making it nonjusticiable.

So the strongest argument would be that it's a political question, making option J the correct answer. Other options might touch on related issues but J directly addresses the nonjusticiability due to the Constitution's allocation of power.

The strongest constitutional argument supporting the defendants' demurrer is that the case presents a nonjusticiable political question. Under Article I, Section 5 of the U.S. Constitution, each House of Congress is granted the authority to determine the qualifications of its members. This power includes deciding residency requirements, which are explicitly constitutional qualifications. Courts have historically held that such decisions are political questions committed to the legislative branch, and as such, they are not reviewable by the judiciary. This principle was reaffirmed in cases like Powell v. McCormack, where the Supreme Court recognized the limits of judicial intervention in matters assigned to Congress by the Constitution. Therefore, the federal court lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate this matter because it involves a political question that the Constitution reserves for the House of Representatives to decide.
