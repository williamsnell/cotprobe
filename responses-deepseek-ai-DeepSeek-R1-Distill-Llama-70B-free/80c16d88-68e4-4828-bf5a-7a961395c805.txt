, I'm trying to solve this math problem. The question is to simplify (2 + 5)^2 - 42. Hmm, okay, let's break it down step by step.

First, I should handle the operations inside the parentheses. So, 2 plus 5 is 7. That simplifies the expression to 7 squared minus 42.

Wait, what's 7 squared? Oh right, 7 times 7 is 49. So now the expression is 49 minus 42.

Subtracting 42 from 49... that gives me 7. So the result should be 7.

Looking at the options, option C is 7. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Adding 2 and 5 gives 7, squaring it is 49, subtracting 42 leaves 7. Yep, that seems right. So the answer must be C.

The expression \((2 + 5)^2 - 42\) simplifies as follows:

1. Compute \(2 + 5\):  
   \(2 + 5 = 7\).

2. Square the result:  
   \(7^2 = 49\).

3. Subtract 42:  
   \(49 - 42 = 7\).

Thus, the final result is 7, which corresponds to option **C**.
