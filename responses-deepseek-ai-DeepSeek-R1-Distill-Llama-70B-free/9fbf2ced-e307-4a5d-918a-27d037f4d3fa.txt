Question:

Three friends decided to go bowling together. They made a friendly wager on the match, with the winner receiving a free beer from the other two guys. In the second frame of the first game, the first friend apparently got a strike when he knocked down all 10 pins. However, the second friend accused the first friend of fouling because his foot went over the line. The first friend denied fouling and wanted to mark down a strike on the scorecard. The second friend refused to give the first friend a strike and wrote in a zero on the scoring sheet. The first friend became enraged. The second friend then went to bowl his frame. As the second friend turned his back, the first friend approached from behind with a bowling ball in his hand. The first friend then raised the bowling ball threatening to hit the back of the second friend's head. The second friend, who had his back turned, did not see the first friend's actions. The third friend saw what the first friend was about to do and could easily have warned the second friend; but the third friend remained silent. The first friend then struck the second friend on the back of the head with the bowling ball, causing a deep scalp wound. If the second friend asserts a cause of action against the third friend, he should

Options:

A: not prevail, because the third friend was under no duty to warn the second friend of the danger.
B: not prevail, as the third friend's silence does not qualify as an act of negligence.
C: prevail, because the third friend contributed to his injury by remaining silent.
D: prevail, because the third friend was aware of the danger.
E: prevail, because the third friend was an accomplice in the first friend's actions.
F: prevail, on account of the third friend's omission to act.
G: not prevail, because the first friend was responsible for his injury.
H: prevail, because the third friend had a moral obligation to warn him.
I: not prevail, because the third friend could not have predicted the first friend's actions.
J: not prevail, because the third friend did not directly cause the injury.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about tort law, specifically dealing with negligence and duty to warn. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the scenario is about three friends bowling. They made a wager where the winner gets a free beer. In the second frame, the first friend got a strike, but the second friend accused him of fouling because his foot went over the line. They argued about whether it's a strike or zero. Then, when the second friend turned his back, the first friend took a bowling ball and hit him on the head, causing a scalp wound. The third friend saw this happening but didn't warn the second friend. Now, the second friend is suing the third friend.

The question is whether the second friend can assert a cause of action against the third friend. The options are from A to J, each giving a different reason.

I remember that in tort law, generally, there's no duty to rescue or warn someone unless there's a special relationship. Like, if you're a bystander, you don't have a duty to help. But there are exceptions, like if you have a special relationship with the person in danger, or if your own actions caused the danger.

So here, the third friend just saw what was happening. He didn't do anything to cause the danger. He just failed to warn. So the question is, did he have a duty to warn the second friend?

I think the general rule is that absent a special relationship or some prior involvement, a bystander doesn't have a duty to warn. So the third friend didn't cause the situation, and he and the second friend are just friends, not in a position where one has a duty to protect the other.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the third friend was under no duty to warn. That aligns with what I was thinking.

Option B says the third friend's silence isn't negligence. Well, negligence is about breaching a duty. If there's no duty, then there's no negligence.

Option C says the third friend contributed by remaining silent. I don't think so, because contributing usually requires some causation, but if there's no duty, you can't be held liable for not acting.

Option D says the third friend was aware of the danger. Awareness alone doesn't create a duty unless there's a special relationship.

Option E claims the third friend was an accomplice. No, because he didn't encourage or assist the first friend; he just didn't warn.

Option F says it's about omission to act. But again, omission only matters if there's a duty to act.

Option G says the first friend is responsible. That's true, but the question is about suing the third friend, not whether the first is liable.

Option H mentions moral obligation, but the law doesn't require moral obligations unless there's a legal duty.

Option I says the third friend couldn't predict the action. But in this case, the third friend did see what was happening, so he could have predicted the danger.

Option J says the third friend didn't directly cause the injury. That's correct; causation is about being the direct cause, but more importantly, there's no duty, so even if he contributed, without a duty, there's no liability.

So the main issue is whether the third friend had a duty to warn. Since they're just friends and he didn't cause the danger, he doesn't have a duty. So the second friend won't prevail.

Looking at the options, A and B both seem possible. Option A says no duty to warn. Option B says silence isn't negligence.

Wait, but the question is about the cause of action against the third friend. So for negligence, you need duty, breach, causation, and damages. If there's no duty, the rest don't matter.

So the correct answer would be that the second friend doesn't prevail because the third had no duty. So option A.

Another angle: sometimes, if you have a special relationship, like parent-child, employer-employee, you might have a duty to protect. But here, just friends, so no.

So I think the answer is A.

The question revolves around whether the second friend can hold the third friend liable for failing to warn him of the impending danger. In tort law, a duty to warn or rescue generally does not exist unless there is a special relationship or the bystander's actions contributed to the danger. Here, the third friend was merely a bystander and did not cause the situation. The absence of a special relationship or any prior involvement means the third friend owed no duty to warn. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Correct. The third friend was under no duty to warn, as there was no special relationship or prior involvement creating such an obligation.
- **Option B**: Also plausible but less precise. While silence itself isn't negligence, the key issue is the absence of a duty.
- **Options C-E, G-I**: Incorrect. These options misapply concepts like contribution, awareness, or moral obligation, which do not establish a legal duty in this context.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. While the third friend didn't directly cause the injury, the primary issue is the lack of duty, not causation.

The correct answer is that the second friend cannot prevail because the third friend had no duty to warn. 

Answer: A
