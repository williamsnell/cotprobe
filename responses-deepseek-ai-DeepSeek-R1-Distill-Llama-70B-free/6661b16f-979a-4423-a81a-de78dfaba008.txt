Alright, so I've got this Laplace transform problem to solve. The question is asking for the Laplace transform of f(t) = t^n, where n is a positive integer. Hmm, okay, I remember that the Laplace transform is a way to convert a time-domain function into a frequency-domain representation, right?

Wait, the Laplace transform formula is something like L{f(t)} = integral from 0 to infinity of e^(-st) f(t) dt. So for f(t) = t^n, it would be the integral of t^n * e^(-st) dt from 0 to infinity. Oh right, I think this is a standard integral that results in a factorial expression.

I recall that integrals of the form ∫ t^k e^(-at) dt from 0 to ∞ equal k! / a^(k+1), where k is a positive integer and a > 0. So in this case, a is s, and k is n. So substituting, the integral becomes n! / s^(n+1). 

Let me double-check that. If n is 0, then t^0 is 1, and the integral of e^(-st) from 0 to ∞ is 1/s, which matches 0! / s^(0+1) = 1/s. Okay, that makes sense. What if n is 1? Then it should be 1! / s^2, which I think is correct because the Laplace transform of t is 1/s².

Wait, looking at the options, I need to match this result. The options are labeled A through J. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: [n² / s^(n+2)], for s>0. Hmm, that denominator exponent is n+2, but I thought it was n+1. So this doesn't match.

Option B: [n! / s^(n-1)], for s>n. The denominator exponent is n-1, which is lower than what I have. Plus, the condition is s>n, but I think the condition should just be s>0 because the integral converges for any s>0.

Option C: [n! / (s^(n+1)+1)], for s>0. Oh, the denominator is s^{n+1} +1, which isn't what I got. I had just s^{n+1} in the denominator. So this isn't right.

Option D: [(n-1)! / s^{n-1}], s>0. Wait, that's (n-1)! over s^{n-1}, which doesn't match n! / s^{n+1}.

Option E: [(n+1)! / s^n], s>0. The numerator is (n+1)! instead of n!, and the denominator is s^n, not s^{n+1}. So no.

Option F: [(n+1)! / s^{n+1}], s>0. The numerator is (n+1)!, but I have n!. So this doesn't match. Unless I made a mistake in my formula...

Wait, wait a second. Let me think again. The integral of t^n e^{-st} dt from 0 to ∞ equals n! / s^{n+1}. Yes, that's correct. So the Laplace transform should be n! / s^{n+1}.

Looking back at the options, none so far match except maybe option F, but F has (n+1)! in the numerator. So that's wrong.

Option G: [(n-1)! / (s^n +1)], s>0. Again, denominator is s^n +1, which isn't matching. And the numerator is (n-1)!.

Option H: [n! / (s^n -1)], s>0. No, denominator is s^n -1, which doesn't fit.

Option I: [n! / (s^n +1)], s>0. Nope, denominator is s^n +1.

Option J: [n! / s^n], s>0. Oh, denominator is s^n, which is smaller by one power than what I have. So that's not right either.

Wait, did I miss any options? Let me check again.

Wait, option B is [n! / s^{n-1}], but that's s^{n-1}, which is even smaller. So none of the options except perhaps I might have gotten the formula wrong.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in remembering the Laplace transform formula. Let me think about the general case. The Laplace transform of t^k is k! / s^{k+1}, correct? So for f(t) = t^n, it's n! / s^{n+1}.

Looking at the options, which one matches that? Let's see:

Option F is [(n+1)! / s^{n+1}], which is close but has (n+1)!.

Hmm, none of the options have n! / s^{n+1}. Let me go through the options again.

Wait, option F: [(n+1)! / s^{n+1}], but that would mean for n=0, it gives (0+1)! / s^{1} = 1/s, which is correct (since t^0 is 1, whose Laplace is 1/s). But wait, for n=1, it would be 2! / s² = 2/s², but the correct Laplace transform of t is 1/s². So that's a problem. So option F can't be correct.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps I'm confusing the formula. Let me recall:

The Laplace transform of t^n is n! / s^{n+1}. So for example, n=0: 0! / s^1 = 1/s. Correct. n=1: 1! / s^2 = 1/s². Correct. n=2: 2! / s^3 = 2/s³. Correct.

So looking at the options again, none of them match except perhaps option F, but option F has (n+1)! / s^{n+1}, which is (n+1)! instead of n!.

Wait, perhaps I missed an option. Let me check.

Looking at the list:

Option F: [(n+1)! / s^{n+1}], for s>0.

Option J: [n! / s^n], for s>0.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement. Let me read the question again. It says f(t) = t^n, n is a positive integer.

Wait, the correct Laplace transform is n! / s^{n+1}, but looking at the options, none of them have that except perhaps option F, but F has (n+1)! in the numerator which is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial analysis. Maybe the correct Laplace transform isn't n! / s^{n+1} but something else.

Wait another thought: I remember that the Laplace transform of t^n is Gamma(n+1)/s^{n+1}, and Gamma(n+1) is n! So that holds. So the correct expression is n! / s^{n+1}.

But looking again, none of the options match this. Let me see all the options.

Option A: [n² / s^{n+2}], for s>0 → No.

Option B: [n! / s^{n-1}], for s>n → No.

Option C: [n! / (s^{n+1}+1)], s>0 → No.

Option D: [(n-1)! / s^{n-1}], s>0 → No.

Option E: [(n+1)! / s^n], s>0 → No.

Option F: [(n+1)! / s^{n+1}], s>0 → No, because numerator is (n+1)!.

Option G: [(n-1)! / (s^n +1)], s>0 → No.

Option H: [n! / (s^n -1)], s>0 → No.

Option I: [n! / (s^n +1)], s>0 → No.

Option J: [n! / s^n], s>0 → No, denominator is s^n.

Wait, so none of the options correctly present the Laplace transform as n! / s^{n+1}. That can't be right. Did I miss an option? Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake when looking. Let me re-express the options:

Option B is [n! / s^{n-1}], which is s^{n-1} → for example, when n=1, it would be 1! / s^{0}=1. But the Laplace transform of t is 1/s², so that's not matching.

Option F is [(n+1)! / s^{n+1}] → when n=1, this becomes 2! / s² = 2/s², but the correct is 1/s². So F is not correct.

Wait, perhaps I need to reevaluate. Did I get the formula wrong? Let me think about the Laplace transform pairs.

I think the correct Laplace transform of t^n is n! / s^{n+1}.

Wait, looking at the options, none of them have that. So perhaps the question has a typo or I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the formula with the inverse Laplace transform. No, I don't think so.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer isn't among the options? But that's unlikely.

Wait, looking again at option F: [(n+1)! / s^{n+1}], for s>0. So if n=0, F gives 1! /s^1=1/s, correct. But for n=1, F gives 2! /s^2=2/s², which is twice the correct value. So F isn't correct.

Hmm... wait, perhaps the correct answer is option F, but I'm making a mistake in the formula. Let me verify using calculus.

Compute the Laplace transform of t^n:

L{t^n} = ∫₀^∞ t^n e^{-st} dt.

Let me make substitution u = st → t = u/s → dt = du/s.

So integral becomes ∫₀^∞ (u/s)^n e^{-u} (du/s) ) = (1/s^{n+1}) ∫₀^∞ u^n e^{-u} du.

The integral ∫₀^∞ u^n e^{-u} du is the definition of Gamma(n+1), which equals n! So the Laplace transform is n! / s^{n+1}.

So it's confirmed. The correct expression is n! / s^{n+1}.

Looking at the options, which one matches this? Let me check each again.

Option F is (n+1)! / s^{n+1} → numerator is (n+1)!, which is wrong.

Option J is n! / s^n → denominator is s^n, not s^{n+1}.

Ah, wait, perhaps the correct option is not present. But that can't be, as the question must have a correct option.

Wait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me check all:

Option B: [n! / s^{n-1}], s>n → No.

Option F: [(n+1)! / s^{n+1}], s>0 → No, numerator wrong.

Wait, perhaps none of the options is correct. But the given options don't include the correct expression. That's confusing.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial assumption. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach: perhaps use the Laplace transform of derivatives.

Wait, the Laplace transform of f(t)=1 is 1/s.

The Laplace transform of t is the derivative of 1/s with respect to s, up to a negative sign.

Wait, L{t f(t)} = -F’(s), where F(s) is L{f(t)}.

Hmm, but for f(t)=1, F(s)=1/s. So L{t *1} = -d/ds (1/s) = 1/s². Which matches our initial result.

Similarly, L{t^2} would involve taking the second derivative, which would give 2! / s^3.

Wait, so I'm confident that the correct Laplace transform is n! / s^{n+1}.

Looking again, perhaps option F is the intended correct answer, but the numerator is (n+1)!.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me look at the options again.

Wait, perhaps option F is correct, but in the numerator, it's (n+1)! ? Let me think for n=0: (0+1)! =1! =1, so 1/s, which is correct. For n=1: (2)! /s^2= 2/s², but L{t} is 1/s². So option F gives 2/s² when n=1, which is wrong.

Hmm, perhaps the correct answer isn't present. But that can't be, so maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me see the original options again:

A: [n² / s^{n+2}]

B: [n! / s^{n-1}]

C: [n! / (s^{n+1}+1)]

D: [(n-1)! / s^{n-1}]

E: [(n+1)! / s^n]

F: [(n+1)! / s^{n+1}]

G: [(n-1)! / (s^n +1)]

H: [n! / (s^n -1)]

I: [n! / (s^n +1)]

J: [n! / s^n]

Wait, none of these match n! / s^{n+1}.

Unless I'm missing an option, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the Laplace transform is (n)! / s^{n+1}, but if the question is about inverse Laplace transform, but no, the question is about the forward transform.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option F, but it's written as (n+1)! / s^{n+1}, which would be the case if the function was t^{n+1}.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the exponent. Let me reevaluate.

Wait, the integral of t^n e^{-st} dt from 0 to ∞ is n! / s^{n+1}.

So for f(t) = t^n, it's n! / s^{n+1}.

Looking at the options again:

Option F is (n+1)! / s^{n+1}.

Option J is n! / s^n.

So the correct answer isn't present. But that can't be the case.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is not among the options. But that's impossible for a multiple-choice question. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should think of the gamma function. Gamma(n) = (n-1)!.

Wait, no, Gamma(n+1) =n!.

Alternatively, perhaps the integral is expressed using the gamma function, but all the options have factorials, not gamma.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up between the gamma function and factorials.

Wait, another approach: Let's test n=2.

n=2: f(t)=t^2.

The Laplace transform should be 2! / s^3 = 2 / s^3.

Looking at the options:

Option F: (2+1)! / s^{2+1} =6 / s^3 → 6/s³, which is 3 times larger than correct.

Option J: 2! / s² = 2/s², which is wrong.

So none of the options give 2/s³.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe there's a typo in the question or options.

But given the options, perhaps the intended correct answer is option F, but that's not correct as per our calculations.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a property. Let me think about the general formula again.

Wait, the Laplace transform of t^n is indeed n! / s^{n+1}.

So the correct answer should have n! divided by s^{n+1}.

Looking back, none of the options have that. So perhaps the correct answer isn't among the options, but that can't be.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the inverse Laplace transform, but no, the question clearly states the Laplace transform.

Wait, perhaps it's a typo in the options. Let me check the options as presented.

Looking back, the options are:

Option F: L{t^n} = [(n+1)! / s^{n+1}], for s > 0.

Option J: [n! / s^n], for s > 0.

Hmm, none of these match. So I must have made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the Laplace transform of t^{n-1}.

Wait, no, the question says t^n.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the definition of the Laplace transform.

I'll compute for n=1.

f(t)=t.

L{f(t)}= ∫₀^∞ t e^{-st} dt.

Let u = st → t= u/s → dt= du/s.

Integral becomes ∫0^∞ (u/s) e^{-u} (du/s) ) → (1/s²) ∫0^∞ u e^{-u} du.

The integral of u e^{-u} du from 0 to ∞ is 1! =1.

So L{t}= 1/s² → 1! /s².

Now, looking at the options for n=1:

Option B: [1! / s^{0}], s>1 → 1/1=1, which is wrong.

Option F: [2! / s²] = 2/s², which is wrong.

Option J: [1! / s^1] =1/s, which is wrong.

Hmm, so for n=1, none of the options give 1/s² except perhaps none. But wait, option F gives 2! /s² =2/s² when n=1. So that's twice the correct value.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is not in the options. But that can't be, so perhaps I made a mistake in the initial formula.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option F, but there's a mistake in the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option F, but thinking that n starts from 0. So perhaps when n=0, it would be correct.

Wait, for
