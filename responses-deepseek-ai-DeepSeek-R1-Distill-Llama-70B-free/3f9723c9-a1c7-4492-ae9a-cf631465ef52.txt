Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about finding the molecular mass of a gas. Hmm, I remember that molecular mass is also called molar mass, right? And to find that, I think I need to use the ideal gas law. Oh wait, the ideal gas law is PV = nRT. But wait, how does that connect to density and molecular mass?

Oh right! There's this formula that relates density to molar mass. I think the formula is d = (PM)/(RT), where d is density, P is pressure, M is molar mass, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature in Kelvin. Yeah, that sounds right.

So the given values are: density d = 2.05 g/L, temperature T = 26.0°C, which I need to convert to Kelvin. Oh right, Kelvin is Celsius plus 273.15. So 26 + 273.15 = 299.15 K. 

The pressure P is 722 torr. Wait, I remember that standard pressure is 1 atm = 760 torr. So I need to convert 722 torr to atm. Let me calculate that: 722 / 760 = 0.950... let's see, 760 times 0.95 is 722. So P = 0.95 atm.

Now, R is the gas constant. But wait, which units? Because d is in g/L, I think R should be in L·atm/(mol·K). Oh right, R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K).

So the formula is d = (P·M)/(R·T). I need to solve for M. So rearranging the formula, M = (d·R·T)/P.

Plugging in the numbers: d = 2.05 g/L, R = 0.0821, T = 299.15 K, P = 0.95 atm.

Let me compute the numerator first: 2.05 * 0.0821 * 299.15.

Calculating step by step:

First, 2.05 * 0.0821. Let me see, 2 * 0.0821 is 0.1642, and 0.05 * 0.0821 is about 0.0041. So together that's 0.1683.

Then multiply that by 299.15. Hmm, 0.1683 * 300 is about 50.49, but since it's 299.15, a bit less. Let's say approximately 50.49 - (0.1683 * 0.85). Wait, 0.85 times 0.1683 is around 0.143. So 50.49 - 0.143 = 50.35. So the numerator is approximately 50.35 g·L·atm/(mol·K) * K? Wait, not sure about the units here, but I think the calculation is right.

Then, denominator is P = 0.95 atm. So M = 50.35 / 0.95.

50.35 divided by 0.95. Let me compute that. 0.95 times 53 is 50.35 because 0.95*50=47.5 and 0.95*3=2.85, so 47.5+2.85=50.35. So 50.35 /0.95 =53.

Wait, so M is approximately 53 g/mol. Looking at the options, option J is 53.0 g/mol. That must be the answer.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So:

d = 2.05 g/L.

Convert T: 26°C is 299.15 K.

P = 722 torr = 722 /760 atm. 722 /760 = 0.950... yes.

R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K).

So M = (2.05 * 0.0821 * 299.15) / 0.95.

Let me compute that more accurately.

2.05 * 0.0821 = let's calculate it:

2.05 * 0.08 is 0.164. 2.05 *0.0021 is 0.004305. So total is 0.164 + 0.004305 = 0.168305.

Now, 0.168305 * 299.15. Let me compute that.

0.168305 * 299.15.

Hmm, 0.168305 * 300 would be 50.4915. But since it's 299.15, which is 300 - 0.85.

So 0.168305 * (-0.85) = -0.14305925.

So 50.4915 - 0.14305925 = 50.34844075.

Then, divide by 0.95: 50.34844075 /0.95.

Calculate 50.34844075 ÷ 0.95.

Well, 0.95 times 53 is 50.35, exactly as before. So M = 53 g/mol.

So the correct answer is J:53.0 g/mol.

To determine the molecular mass (molar mass) of the gas, we use the relationship between density, pressure, temperature, and molar mass, given by the formula:

\[
d = \frac{P \cdot M}{R \cdot T}
\]

Where:
- \(d\) is the density of the gas (2.05 g/L),
- \(P\) is the pressure in atm (converted from 722 torr: \(P = \frac{722}{760} = 0.95 \, \text{atm}\)),
- \(M\) is the molar mass (to be determined),
- \(R\) is the gas constant (\(R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)}\)),
- \(T\) is the temperature in Kelvin (converted from \(26.0^\circ \text{C}\): \(T = 26.0 + 273.15 = 299.15 \, \text{K}\)).

Rearranging the formula to solve for \(M\):

\[
M = \frac{d \cdot R \cdot T}{P}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
M = \frac{2.05 \cdot 0.0821 \cdot 299.15}{0.95}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
2.05 \cdot 0.0821 = 0.168305
\]

\[
0.168305 \cdot 299.15 = 50.34844075
\]

Now, divide by the pressure:

\[
M = \frac{50.34844075}{0.95} = 53.0 \, \text{g/mol}
\]

Thus, the molecular mass of the gas is approximately **53.0 g/mol**. Comparing this result to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**J: 53.0 g/mol**
