Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here about calculating the change in entropy when liquid water at -5°C turns into ice at the same temperature, both under 1 atm pressure. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

First, I remember that entropy change (ΔS) is related to heat transfer and temperature. The formula I think is ΔS = q_rev / T, where q_rev is the heat exchanged in a reversible process and T is the absolute temperature in Kelvin.

Wait, the process here is freezing, right? So liquid water turning into ice. I know that freezing is exothermic, so the system releases heat. But since we're going from liquid to solid, the entropy should decrease because solids are more ordered than liquids. So I expect a negative ΔS.

But how do I calculate it? Oh right, for a phase change at constant temperature, the entropy change is ΔS = ΔH / T. But wait, ΔH here is the enthalpy change for the process. Since this is freezing, the enthalpy change should be negative because the system is releasing heat.

Wait, but the problem gives me the enthalpy of fusion at 0°C, which is 1,440 cal per mole. Fusion is melting, so ΔH_fusion is positive when going from solid to liquid. But in this case, we're going the opposite way: liquid to solid (freezing). So the ΔH for freezing would be -1,440 cal/mol.

So I have ΔH = -1,440 cal/mol. But wait, the temperature here is -5°C, not 0°C. Oh, right, because the process is happening at a lower temperature than the standard freezing point. So I can't directly use the standard ΔH_fusion. Hmm, do I need to adjust for the temperature change?

Wait, but wait, the formula for entropy change when the process is isothermal (same temperature) might still work, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe I need to account for the heat capacity because the temperature is different from the standard freezing point.

Wait, the problem gives me heat capacities for both liquid and solid water. Oh, right, because we're not at 0°C, so the process might involve cooling the liquid water from 0°C to -5°C, then freezing it, and then warming the ice back up? Or is it a direct phase change at -5°C?

Wait, no. The question states that both the initial and final states are at -5°C. So we're going from liquid at -5°C to ice at -5°C. But wait, normally water freezes at 0°C, so at -5°C, liquid water is supercooled. But assuming it's possible, the process is happening at that same temperature.

Hmm, in that case, the phase change occurs at -5°C, so the temperature is the same for both phases. So for the entropy change, we can use the formula ΔS = (q_rev) / T.

But wait, the heat released during freezing (which is the negative of the heat absorbed during melting) would be q = -ΔH_fusion, but at a different temperature.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. The standard ΔH_fusion is given at 0°C. So if we're at -5°C, the actual enthalpy change for the phase transition might be different because the heat capacities come into play.

Wait, but in this problem, the process is at constant temperature (-5°C), so perhaps the heat involved is just the enthalpy change at that temperature. Or maybe I'm overcomplicating it.

Wait, maybe I should approach it as two steps. First, cool the liquid water from 0°C to -5°C, then freeze it at -5°C, and then perhaps warm the ice back to -5°C? No, that doesn't make sense because the initial and final temperatures are the same. Maybe the process is just the phase change at -5°C, but using the ΔH at that temperature.

But wait, the ΔH_fusion is given at 0°C, so to find the ΔH at -5°C, I need to adjust it using the heat capacities. Because the enthalpy change depends on temperature.

So the process would involve:

1. Cooling the liquid from 0°C to -5°C.
2. Freezing the liquid at -5°C.
3. Then, since the final state is ice at -5°C, maybe no further steps?

Wait, but each step contributes to the entropy change. Hmm.

So, the total entropy change would be the sum of the entropy change from cooling the liquid and the entropy change from freezing at -5°C.

Let me break it down.

First, calculate the entropy change for cooling the liquid from 0°C to -5°C.

The formula for entropy change when temperature changes is ΔS = n C_p ln(T2/T1), but wait, wait—actually, the formula is ΔS = n C_p ln(T2/T1) only if C_p is constant over the temperature range, which we can assume here.

But wait, wait, no, because the formula is ΔS = integral from T1 to T2 of (C_p / T) dT, which for constant C_p is C_p ln(T2/T1). But wait, the temperatures are in Kelvin, right? So I have to convert -5°C to Kelvin.

-5°C is 268 K (since 273 -5 =268). 0°C is 273 K.

So for the cooling step:

ΔS1 = n * C_p(liquid) * ln(T2/T1)

Wait, but wait, when cooling, the temperature decreases, so the entropy change should be negative because the system is losing heat.

Wait, but the formula for entropy change when cooling would be negative. Let me think: if you go from higher T to lower T, ln(T2/T1) is negative, so ΔS1 would be negative.

But in this case, the liquid is cooling, so it's releasing heat, so the entropy of the system (the water) decreases, which makes sense.

So,

ΔS1 = n * C_p(liquid) * ln(268/273)

C_p for liquid is 18 cal/(deg·mol), and n is 1 mole.

Then,

ΔS1 = 1 * 18 * ln(268/273) = 18 * ln(0.9851)

Calculate ln(0.9851). Let me think, ln(1) is 0, ln(0.99) is about -0.01005, so 0.9851 is a bit lower.

Wait, 268/273 = 0.9828? Wait, wait, 268 divided by 273 is approximately 0.9828, right? Because 273 -5 is 268. So 268/273 = 0.9828 approximately.

So ln(0.9828) is approximately -0.0177 (I think). Because ln(0.98) is about -0.0202, and 0.9828 is higher than 0.98, so the ln would be less negative, maybe around -0.0177.

So ΔS1 ≈ 18 * (-0.0177) = -0.3186 cal/K·mol.

Wait, but wait, the units for entropy are typically in cal/(K·mol) or sometimes converted to e.u. (entropy units), where 1 e.u. = 1 cal/(K·mol) because the conversion factor for cal to joules isn't in play here.

Wait, but the problem gives the heat capacities in cal/(deg·mol), and since we're using Kelvin, which has the same size degrees as Celsius, the calculation should be fine.

So that's ΔS1 = ~-0.3186 e.u.

Now, the second step is the actual freezing at -5°C. So the entropy change for the phase change at T =268 K.

So for the phase change, ΔS2 = ΔH_freezing / T.

Wait, because when a substance freezes, it releases heat, so ΔH_freezing is negative. So ΔH_freezing = -ΔH_fusion.

Wait, but wait, ΔH_fusion is the heat absorbed when melting (liquid - solid), which is positive. So freezing would have ΔH_freezing = -1440 cal/mol.

So ΔS2 = (-1440 cal/mol) / (268 K) = (-1440)/268 cal/(K·mol)

Calculating that: 1440 /268 ≈ 5.373 cal/(K·mol) → so with the negative sign, it's approximately -5.373 cal/(K·mol), which is -5.373 e.u.

Wait, but wait, is ΔH the same at -5°C as it is at 0°C? Because I adjusted the temperature in the first step, perhaps the actual ΔH at -5°C is different from the standard ΔH at 0°C.

Ah, right! Because the standard ΔH_fusion is given at 0°C, but we're freezing at -5°C, so the actual enthalpy change would be different. Because the substance (water) would have a different enthalpy at -5°C than at 0°C.

So to calculate the correct ΔH for the phase change at -5°C, I need to adjust the standard ΔH using the heat capacities.

Wait, so the total process is cooling the liquid from 0°C to -5°C, then freezing it at -5°C, and then warming the ice from -5°C back to its initial temperature? Wait, no, because the final state is ice at -5°C, so perhaps the steps are:

1. Cool liquid from 0°C to -5°C → entropy change ΔS1 (which I calculated as ~-0.3186 e.u.), and enthalpy change ΔH1 = n C_p(liquid) ΔT.

2. Freeze the liquid at -5°C → entropy change ΔS2 = ΔH_freezing(T) / T, but ΔH_freezing(T) is not the same as at 0°C.

Wait, perhaps I should use the enthalpy of the liquid and solid at -5°C relative to 0°C.

So, let me think: The standard ΔH_fusion at 0°C is 1440 cal/mol, which is the enthalpy of melting ice at 0°C to water at 0°C.

So, the actual ΔH for freezing at -5°C would be ΔH = ΔH_fusion + (H_liquid at -5°C - H_ice at -5°C).

Wait, but to find the ΔH for the process at -5°C, I can compute it as:

ΔH(T) = ΔH_fusion + [H_liquid(T) - H_ice(T)]

But H_liquid(T) is lower than H_liquid at 0°C, because it's cooled. Similarly, H_ice(T) is lower than H_ice at 0°C.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the total ΔH for the process of cooling the liquid to -5°C, then freezing, and then considering the ice at -5°C.

Alternatively, another approach: The total change in entropy is the sum of the entropy change from cooling the liquid, the entropy change from freezing at -5°C, and the entropy change from warming the ice back to -5°C? Wait, no, because the ice is already at -5°C after freezing, so maybe that's not necessary.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the total entropy change as the sum of three steps:

1. Cool liquid from 0°C to -5°C. → ΔS1.

2. Freeze at -5°C. → ΔS2.

3. Warm the resulting ice from -5°C to some temperature? No, because the final state is ice at -5°C, same as the initial state's temperature. So perhaps it's just steps 1 and 2.

Wait, perhaps the overall process is just the phase change at -5°C, but the initial state is liquid at -5°C. So perhaps the calculation is different.

Wait, but the initial state is liquid at -5°C. To get to ice at -5°C, perhaps the process is just the phase change at that temperature. But the problem gives the heat capacities, so maybe it's expecting a calculation that includes the heat capacity effect.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the entropy change for the process at -5°C, considering that the enthalpy change at that temperature is different from the standard ΔH.

So, the standard ΔH_fusion at 0°C is 1440 cal/mol (from ice to water). So, for the reverse process (water to ice), ΔH_freezing at 0°C is -1440 cal/mol.

But at -5°C, the actual ΔH for freezing would be:

ΔH(T) = ΔH_fusion + [ (H_liquid(T) - H_liquid(0°C)) ) - (H_solid(T) - H_solid(0°C)) ) ]

So, H_liquid(T) = H_liquid(0°C) + ∫(0°C to T) C_p(liquid) dT

Similarly, H_solid(T) = H_solid(0°C) + ∫(0°C to T) C_p(solid) dT

But from 0°C to T (-5°C), the temperature change is ΔT = -5°C = -5 K.

So,

H_liquid(T) = H_liquid(0°C) + C_p(liquid) * ΔT

H_solid(T) = H_solid(0°C) + C_p(solid) * ΔT

So the difference in enthalpy between liquid and solid at T is:

H_liquid(T) - H_solid(T) = [H_liquid(0°C) - H_solid(0°C)] + [C_p(liquid) - C_p(solid)] * ΔT

But [H_liquid(0°C) - H_solid(0°C)] is ΔH_fusion, which is 1440 cal/mol.

So,

H_liquid(T) - H_solid(T) = 1440 + (18 -9) * (-5) → because C_p(liquid)=18, C_p(solid)=9, and ΔT = -5.

So,

= 1440 + (9) * (-5) = 1440 -45 = 1395 cal/mol.

So the ΔH for the freezing process at -5°C is - (H_liquid(T) - H_solid(T)) ) → because freezing is solid forming from liquid, so the enthalpy change is negative of that.

Wait, wait. For the process of freezing (liquid → solid), the enthalpy change is:

ΔH = H_solid - H_liquid = - (H_liquid - H_solid) = - (1395) = -1395 cal/mol.

Wait, no, because in the calculation above, H_liquid(T) - H_solid(T) is 1395 cal/mol, so the enthalpy change for freezing (liquid → solid) is negative that value: ΔH = -1395 cal/mol.

Wait, no, wait. Because when you go from liquid to solid, the system releases heat, so ΔH is negative. So the correct ΔH for freezing at T would be -1395 cal/mol.

So now, the entropy change for the phase transition at T is ΔS2 = ΔH / T = (-1395 cal/mol) / (268 K) ≈ -5.197 cal/(K·mol) → approximately -5.20 e.u.

But wait, I also have to account for the entropy change from cooling the liquid from 0°C to -5°C, which was ΔS1 ≈ -0.3186 e.u.

So the total entropy change is ΔS_total = ΔS1 + ΔS2 ≈ (-0.3186) + (-5.197) ≈ -5.5156 e.u.

Looking at the options, the closest one is option G: -5.27 eu. But wait, my calculation is -5.5156, which isn't exactly any of the options. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate more accurately. Let me recalculate each step.

First, the cooling of the liquid from 0°C (273 K) to -5°C (268 K):

ΔS1 = n C_p ln(T2/T1) → T2=268 K, T1=273 K.

So ln(268/273) = ln(0.9828) ≈ let's calculate it more accurately.

Using a calculator, ln(0.9828) ≈ -0.01772.

So ΔS1 = 1 * 18 cal/K·mol * (-0.01772) ≈ 18 * (-0.01772) ≈ -0.31896 cal/K·mol.

Now, for the enthalpy change at -5°C, H_liquid(T) - H_solid(T) = 1440 + (18 -9)*(-5) = 1440 + 9*(-5) = 1440 -45 = 1395 cal/mol.

So ΔH_freezing(T) = -1395 cal/mol.

Thus, ΔS2 = (-1395) / 268 ≈ -5.197 cal/(K·mol), which is -5.197 e.u.

So total ΔS = (-0.31896) + (-5.197) ≈ -5.51596 e.u.

But the options don't have -5.52. The closest option is G: -5.27 eu. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the enthalpy change at T.

Wait, perhaps the adjustment for the enthalpy should be done differently. Let me think again.

Another approach: The entropy change for the process can be calculated directly using the formula for phase transitions at a different temperature, considering the heat capacities.

But perhaps a simpler approach is to calculate the entropy change as the sum of two steps: cooling the liquid to -5°C and then freezing it at that temperature.

So,

ΔS_total = ΔS_cooling + ΔS_freezing.

We calculated ΔS_cooling as -0.319 eu.

ΔS_freezing = ΔH_freezing(T) / T.

But ΔH_freezing(T) is the enthalpy change when freezing at T, which is lower than the standard ΔH_fusion because at lower temperatures, the enthalpy of the liquid is lower.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for ΔS is:

ΔS = (ΔH_fusion) / T + (C_p(liquid) - C_p(solid)) * ln(T/T_fus), but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another method: The entropy change when the phase change occurs at a temperature T different from the standard T_fus (0°C) can be calculated using:

ΔS = ΔH_fusion / T_fus + (C_p(liquid) - C_p(solid)) * ln(T / T_fus)

But wait, that might not be the correct formula. Alternatively
