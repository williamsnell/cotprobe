Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is about finding the pH of a 1.0 M solution of sodium acetate. Sodium acetate is a strong electrolyte, so I remember that it should dissociate completely in water. 

Wait, sodium acetate is NaCH3COO, right? So when it dissolves, it breaks down into Na+ and CH3COO^- ions. Sodium ions are spectator ions, they don't really affect the pH because they're the conjugate of a strong base (NaOH). So the key here is the acetate ion, CH3COO^-.

Acetate is the conjugate base of acetic acid, which is a weak acid. I remember that when a conjugate base is in water, it can hydrolyze. That means it reacts with water to form its conjugate acid and hydroxide ions. The reaction would be CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-.

Since the acetate ion is a base, the solution should be basic, so the pH should be greater than 7. But I need to calculate exactly what it is.

The problem gives me the Ka for acetic acid, which is 1.8e-5. But wait, since we're dealing with the base here, I think I need to find the Kb for acetate. Oh right, because Kw = Ka * Kb. Kw is 1e-14 at 25°C. So Kb would be Kw / Ka.

Let me compute that. Ka is 1.8e-5, so Kb = 1e-14 / 1.8e-5. Let me calculate that. 1e-14 divided by 1.8e-5 is approximately 5.5556e-10. So Kb ≈ 5.56e-10.

Now, the acetate ion concentration is 1.0 M because sodium acetate is a strong electrolyte and it dissociates completely. So the initial concentration of CH3COO^- is 1.0 M. 

The hydrolysis reaction is CH3COO^- + H2O ↔ CH3COOH + OH^-. The initial concentrations are [CH3COO^-] = 1.0 M, and the products are 0. So the change would be -x for CH3COO^- and +x for both CH3COOH and OH^-.

At equilibrium, [CH3COO^-] = 1.0 - x, [CH3COOH] = x, [OH^-] = x. Since Kb is small (5.56e-10), x should be much smaller than 1.0, so we can approximate 1.0 - x ≈ 1.0.

So the Kb expression is Kb = [CH3COOH][OH^-] / [CH3COO^-] = (x)(x)/(1.0) = x². So x² = 5.56e-10 → x = sqrt(5.56e-10) → let me calculate that.

The square root of 5.56e-10 is approximately 7.456e-5. So [OH^-] ≈ 7.456e-5 M.

Now, pOH is -log[OH^-]. Let me compute that. Log(7.456e-5) is log(7.456) + log(1e-5). Log(7.456) is about 0.872, and log(1e-5) is -5. So pOH ≈ 4.128.

Wait, no, wait. Because pH + pOH =14. So if I have pOH, then pH is 14 - pOH. Let me calculate that correctly. Oh, wait, no: wait. Wait, pOH is -log[OH^-]. So if [OH^-] is 7.456e-5, then log(7.456e-5) is log(7.456) + log(1e-5) → 0.872 -5 = -4.128. So pOH is 4.128. Therefore, pH is 14 - 4.128 = 9.872.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 9.872. Let me check the options again. The options are:

A:11.2, B:8.2, C:7.4, D:5.6, E:10.0, F:4.5, G:6.3, H:7.0, I:3.8, J:9.4.

Hmm, 9.872 is close to 9.9, but the closest option is J:9.4. Wait, did I make a calculation mistake?

Wait, perhaps I should do a more accurate calculation. Let's recheck the steps.

First, Kb = 1e-14 / 1.8e-5 = (1/1.8) * 1e-9 → 0.5555...e-9 → 5.555e-10.

So, x^2 = 5.555e-10 → x = sqrt(5.555e-10) = sqrt(5.555)*1e-5.

What's the square root of 5.555? Let's compute that. 5.555 is between 5.0625 (which is 2.25^2) and 6.76 (2.6^2). Let's see: 2.35^2 is 5.5225, 2.36^2 is 5.5696. So sqrt(5.555) is approximately 2.357.

So x ≈ 2.357e-5.

So [OH^-] = 2.357e-5 → pOH is -log(2.357e-5) = ?

Let me compute log(2.357e-5). Log(2.357) is around 0.3715. So log(2.357e-5) is 0.3715 -5 = -4.6285. So pOH is 4.6285.

So pH = 14 - 4.6285 = 9.3715, which is approximately 9.37. Looking back at the options, J is 9.4, which is very close.

But wait, perhaps I should not have made the assumption that x is negligible compared to 1.0. Let me check that. 

The assumption is that x << 1.0, so 1.0 - x ≈ 1.0. Let's see, x is about 2.357e-5, which is 0.002357%, so yes, the assumption holds. So the approximation is valid.

So the pH should be around 9.37, which would round to approximately 9.4. So the correct answer would be option J: 9.4.

Wait, but let me think again. Another approach is to use the exact quadratic equation without approximation.

The Kb expression is x^2 / (1 - x) = 5.555e-10.

Assuming x is much smaller than 1, so 1 - x ≈1, so x ≈ sqrt(5.555e-10) ≈ 2.357e-5, as before. So the same result.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered the contribution of water autoionization, but I think that's negligible here.

So the pH is approximately 9.37, which is closest to option J: 9.4.

To determine the pH of a 1.0 M solution of sodium acetate, we start by recognizing that sodium acetate (NaCH3COO) is a strong electrolyte, meaning it dissociates completely in water into Na+ and CH3COO^- ions. The sodium ion (Na+) is a spectator ion and does not affect the pH. The acetate ion (CH3COO^-), however, is the conjugate base of acetic acid (CH3COOH), a weak acid, and will undergo hydrolysis in water:

\[
\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^- + \text{H}_2\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{CH}_3\text{COOH} + \text{OH}^-
\]

The equilibrium constant for this reaction is the base dissociation constant, \( K_b \), which can be calculated using the relationship \( K_a \cdot K_b = K_w \), where \( K_w = 1.0 \times 10^{-14} \) at 25°C. Given \( K_a = 1.8 \times 10^{-5} \), we find:

\[
K_b = \frac{K_w}{K_a} = \frac{1.0 \times 10^{-14}}{1.8 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 5.56 \times 10^{-10}.
\]

The initial concentration of CH3COO^- is 1.0 M, and at equilibrium, the concentration of OH^- ions is determined by the hydrolysis reaction. Let the change in concentration of CH3COO^- be \( x \), so at equilibrium:

\[
[\text{CH}_3\text{COO}^-] = 1.0 - x, \quad [\text{CH}_3\text{COOH}] = x, \quad [\text{OH}^-] = x.
\]

Substituting into the expression for \( K_b \):

\[
K_b = \frac{[CH_3COOH][OH^-]}{[CH_3COO^-]} = \frac{x^2}{1.0 - x}.
\]

Since \( K_b \) is very small, \( x \) is much smaller than 1.0, so \( 1.0 - x \approx 1.0 \). This simplifies to:

\[
K_b = x^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \sqrt{K_b} = \sqrt{5.56 \times 10^{-10}} \approx 2.357 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

Thus, the concentration of OH^- ions is approximately \( 2.357 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M} \). The pOH is calculated as:

\[
\text{pOH} = -\log{[\text{OH}^-]} = -\log{(2.357 \times 10^{-5})}.
\]

Breaking this into components:

\[
\log{(2.357 \times 10^{-5})} = \log{2.357} + \log{10^{-5}} \approx 0.3715 - 5 = -4.6285.
\]

Thus:

\[
\text{pOH} \approx 4.6285.
\]

The pH is then:

\[
\text{pH} = 14 - \text{pOH} = 14 - 4.6285 \approx 9.3715.
\]

Rounding to one decimal place, the pH is approximately 9.4. Comparing this to the given options:

- **A: 11.2**, **B: 8.2**, **C: 7.4**, **D: 5.6**, **E: 10.0**, **F: 4.5**, **G: 6.3**, **H: 7.0**, **I: 3.8**, **J: 9.4**.

The closest match is **J: 9.4**.
