Question:

 Which of the following potentially morally relevant differences between Fred's behavior and the behavior of the consumers of factory-raised meat does Norcross not discuss?

Options:

A: Fred's behavior involves the suffering of puppies, whereas the behavior of meat-eaters "merely" involves the suffering of chickens, pigs, cows, calves, sheep, and the like.
B: The suffering of the puppies is necessary for gustatory pleasure, whereas the suffering of animals on factory farms is simply a by-product of the conditions dictated by economic considerations.
C: Fred could prevent the suffering of the puppies, whereas meat-eaters can't prevent the suffering of the animals they consume.
D: none of the above

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question to answer, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question carefully.

The question is about which morally relevant difference Norcross does not discuss between Fred's behavior and that of consumers of factory-raised meat. The options are A, B, C, and D. 

First, I remember that Norcross, in his arguments, often compares Fred, who tortures puppies for pleasure, with people who consume factory-raised meat. He's trying to highlight the moral inconsistency in how society treats these two actions differently.

So, Norcross's main point is that both actions cause suffering, but people react more harshly to Fred than to meat-eaters, even though the suffering in factory farms is on a massive scale. He argues that the meat-eaters' behavior is worse because more animals are involved, but society doesn't condemn it as much.

Looking at the options:

Option A says Fred's behavior involves puppies, while meat-eaters involve other animals. I think Norcross does discuss the species difference, but maybe he doesn't consider it morally relevant. Or maybe he does talk about it but dismisses it as not justifying the moral difference in treatment.

Option B suggests that puppies' suffering is for gustatory pleasure, whereas factory farms' suffering is a by-product of economic conditions. Wait, Fred tortures puppies for pleasure, while factory farming's suffering is due to efficiency and cost-cutting. I think Norcross does mention that the motivation for meat consumption is taste, similar to Fred's pleasure, so maybe this point is covered. Or perhaps he argues that both are for pleasure, but I'm not sure if he contrasts the direct vs. by-product aspect.

Option C states that Fred could prevent the puppies' suffering, but meat-eaters can't prevent the animals' suffering they consume. Hmm. Wait, meat-eaters can choose not to buy factory-raised meat, so they can prevent it by making different choices. But if the option is saying that Fred can prevent it more directly, maybe Norcross doesn't address this point. Or perhaps he does discuss the idea that meat-eaters contribute to the problem through their choices.

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on exactly which points Norcross covers. Let me think again. Norcross's argument is that both actions cause suffering, but society condemns Fred more. He argues that the scope (number of animals) is worse in factory farming, so the moral reaction should be stronger, but it's not. He might also discuss the species aspect, but he probably dismisses it as not a morally relevant difference.

So, looking at the options, which difference does he not discuss?

Option A: Different species. Does Norcross talk about species? I think he does mention that we have different attitudes towards different species, but he argues that this isn't a morally justifiable difference. So maybe he does discuss it, so this option would be something he does discuss, meaning it's not the correct answer.

Option B: Suffering for pleasure vs. suffering as a by-product. I'm trying to recall. Norcross says that the suffering in factory farms is for our taste preferences, similar to Fred's pleasure. So perhaps he does discuss this, meaning this option is covered, so it's not the answer.

Option C: Ability to prevent suffering. Fred can stop, and meat-eaters can choose not to buy, so perhaps Norcross doesn't bring up this point. Or maybe he does. Wait, in his argument, he emphasizes that consumers contribute to the problem by their choices, implying that they can prevent it by choosing differently. So maybe option C is a point he does discuss, so it's not the answer.

Wait, but the question is which difference Norcross does NOT discuss. So if the correct answer is the option that he doesn't address, then I need to find which one isn't covered.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D: none of the above, meaning Norcross discusses all of A, B, and C. But I'm not certain.

Wait, let me think again. In Norcross's argument, he focuses on the scale of suffering and the species involved. He argues that the sheer number of animals in factory farms makes the moral issue worse than Fred's case. So he does discuss species (A) and the scale. But does he discuss the reason for the suffering, like whether it's for pleasure or a by-product?

Wait, in the factory farm case, the suffering is a result of the conditions required to produce cheap meat, which is driven by consumer demand for affordable meat. So the suffering is a by-product of economic factors and the desire for cheap food, whereas Fred's actions are directly for his pleasure. So maybe Norcross does discuss this difference (option B), saying that both are for human pleasure, but in different ways.

Alternatively, perhaps he doesn't address whether the suffering is a direct goal or a by-product. Maybe he just points out that both cause suffering for human benefit, regardless of the reason.

As for option C, he probably does discuss that consumers can choose to avoid contributing to factory farming by not buying the products, just like Fred can choose to stop torturing puppies. So he might argue that both have the ability to prevent the suffering, so option C is a point he covers.

If that's the case, then the question is asking which difference he does NOT discuss. So, if all options A, B, and C are points he does discuss, then the answer would be D: none of the above, meaning the question's premise is wrong and all are discussed.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to piece it together. Norcross's argument centers on the moral inconsistency, pointing out that the magnitude of suffering is greater in factory farms, and that species isn't a morally relevant factor. He also argues that the reason (taste) is not a sufficient justification for the suffering in either case.

So, perhaps he doesn't discuss the point in option C: the ability to prevent. Or maybe he does. If he does, then the answer would not be C. Alternatively, perhaps he does not address whether the suffering is a necessary part of the action or just a by-product.

Wait, another angle: the question is about potentially morally relevant differences that Norcross does NOT discuss. So, if one of the options presents a difference that could be morally relevant but Norcross doesn't bring it up, that would be the answer.

I'm starting to think that the answer is A: different species. Wait, no, because Norcross does discuss species, arguing that it's not a morally relevant difference. So he does discuss A.

So, the differences he discusses are: species (A), the number of animals (scale), and the reason (pleasure in both cases). So B and C: does he discuss B, which is about the reason for suffering being for pleasure vs. by-product?

Wait, perhaps he does discuss that both are for pleasure, so B is covered. As for C, he does discuss that consumers can choose to avoid the suffering by not buying factory-raised meat, so C is covered.

Wait, but looking back, the question is about the differences between Fred and the consumers. So the difference in option B is that Fred's suffering is for gustatory pleasure, while the factory farm suffering is a by-product of economic conditions. So perhaps Norcross argues that both are for human pleasure (taste), so the suffering is similarly motivated, making B a point he does discuss.

So, if all three options (A, B, C) are discussed by Norcross, then the answer would be D: none of the above, meaning the question's options are all discussed, so the correct answer is D.

Alternatively, if one of them isn't discussed, then that would be the answer.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline Norcross's points:

1. Species: He argues that the species difference (puppy vs. cow, etc.) isn't morally relevant. So he discusses A.

2. Number of animals: Factory farms involve many more animals, making the issue worse. Not directly an option here, but related.

3. Motivation: Both Fred and meat-eaters act for pleasure (taste), so B is discussed.

4. Ability to prevent: He suggests that consumers can choose to avoid factory-raised meat, so C is discussed.

Therefore, all options A, B, and C are points Norcross discusses. So the question is which is NOT discussed. Since all are discussed, the answer is D: none of the above.

Wait, but the question asks which is NOT discussed. So if Norcross does discuss all of A, B, and C, then the correct answer is D. So the answer is D.

The question asks which potentially morally relevant difference between Fred's behavior and the behavior of consumers of factory-raised meat Norcross does not discuss. To determine this, we analyze the options in light of Norcross's arguments.

Norcross compares Fred, who tortures puppies for pleasure, with consumers of factory-raised meat, highlighting the moral inconsistency in societal reactions to these actions. He argues that both actions cause suffering, but society condemns Fred more harshly, despite the greater scale of suffering in factory farming. Norcross discusses the following points:

1. **Species (Option A):** Norcross addresses the difference in species (puppies vs. factory-farmed animals) but argues that species alone is not a morally relevant difference. Thus, he does discuss this point.

2. **Motivation for Suffering (Option B):** Norcross notes that both Fred's actions and factory farming involve suffering for human pleasure (taste in the case of meat-eaters). He argues that the suffering in factory farming, while often framed as a by-product of economic conditions, is ultimately driven by consumer demand for affordable meat. Therefore, this point is also discussed.

3. **Ability to Prevent Suffering (Option C):** Norcross suggests that consumers can prevent the suffering of factory-farmed animals by making different choices, just as Fred can choose to stop torturing puppies. Thus, this point is also addressed.

Since Norcross discusses all the differences outlined in options A, B, and C, the correct answer is that none of the above differences are left undiscussed.

Answer: D
