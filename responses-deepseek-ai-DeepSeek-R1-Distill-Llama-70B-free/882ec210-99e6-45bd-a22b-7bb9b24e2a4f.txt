Okay, so I'm trying to solve this radiocarbon dating problem. Hmm, I remember that radiocarbon dating is used to determine the age of organic materials that are up to around 50,000 years old. The process involves measuring the amount of the radioactive isotope carbon-14 (¹⁴C) left in the sample.

The question gives me a sample of bristlecone pine wood with an age determined by counting growth rings as 7,000 ± 100 years. But the activity is given as 6.6 disintegrations per minute per gram of carbon. I need to find the exact age using radiochemical evidence, so probably using the radiocarbon decay formula.

Wait, the formula I remember is N = N0 * e^(-kt), but I think another version uses the decay constant and the half-life. Oh right, the formula can also be written in terms of the half-life (t₁/₂). The decay constant λ is ln(2)/t₁/₂. 

So the formula relating activity to age is A = A0 * e^(-λt), where A is the current activity, A0 is the initial activity, λ is the decay constant, and t is the time elapsed.

I think the initial activity A0 is about 15 disintegrations per minute per gram of carbon. That's the standard value for modern carbon, right? So modern samples have an activity of 15 dpm/g C.

Wait, let me make sure. Yes, I've read that the contemporary standard is 15 dpm/g. So A0 is 15, and A is given as 6.6.

So plugging in the numbers: 6.6 = 15 * e^(-λt). I need to solve for t.

First, divide both sides by 15 to get 6.6/15 = e^(-λt). Let me compute that. 6.6 divided by 15 is 0.44. So 0.44 = e^(-λt).

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides: ln(0.44) = -λt. So t = - ln(0.44) / λ.

Wait, I need to find λ. The half-life of ¹⁴C is about 5,730 years. So λ = ln(2)/5,730. Let me calculate that. ln(2) is approximately 0.693. So λ = 0.693 / 5,730 ≈ 0.00012097 per year.

So t = - ln(0.44) / 0.00012097.

Let me compute ln(0.44). The natural logarithm of 0.44 is about -0.82098. So plug that in: t = 0.82098 / 0.00012097 ≈ ?

Let me compute that division. 0.82098 divided by 0.00012097. Let's see, 0.00012 is 1.2e-4. So 0.82 / 0.00012 is about 6,833. But let me compute it accurately.

Dividing 0.82098 by 0.00012097:

0.82098 / 0.00012097 ≈ 6788 years. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial steps. Let me go through it again.

We have A = A0 * e^(-λt). So 6.6 = 15 * e^(-λt).

Divide both sides by 15: 0.44 = e^(-λt).

Take the natural log: ln(0.44) = -λt.

So t = - ln(0.44) / λ.

Compute ln(0.44): Using a calculator, ln(0.44) is approximately -0.82098.

So t = 0.82098 / λ.

λ is 0.693 / 5730 ≈ 0.00012097 per year.

So t = 0.82098 / 0.00012097 ≈ let's compute that.

0.82098 divided by 0.00012097 equals approximately 6788 years.

Wait, that's about 6,788 years. But the options don't have that number. Let me look at the options again.

Options are:

A: 6,750
B: 5,500
C: 6,000
D:7,000
E:6,225
F:7,350
G:5,730
H:7,150
I:6,400
J:5,915

Hmm, 6,788 is closest to option A: 6,750. But wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the division.

Wait wait, let me calculate 0.82098 ÷ 0.00012097 more accurately.

0.00012097 is approximately 1.2097e-4.

So 0.82098 ÷ 1.2097e-4.

Let me compute 0.82098 / 0.00012097.

Let me rewrite it as 82098 ÷ 12097 ≈ let me compute that.

Wait, 0.82098 / 0.00012097 equals (0.82098 * 100000) / 12.097.

Wait, 0.82098 * 1e5 is 82098.

So 82098 ÷ 12.097 → Let me compute 82098 ÷ 12.097.

12.097 × 6,788 ≈ Let's see. 12 × 6,788 = 81,456. 0.097 ×6,788 is approx 658. So total 82,114. Hmm, but 82,098 is less than that.

Wait, perhaps 6,788 is a little too high. Let me compute 12.097 × 6,786.

12 × 6,786 = 81,432.

0.097 ×6,786 ≈ 658.

So 81,432 + 658 = 82,090. That's very close to 82,098. So 6,786 years would give 82,090, and our numerator is 82,098, so that's about 6,786. Let's say approximately 6,787 years.

But the closest option is A: 6,750. None is exactly 6,787. So perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise numbers. Let me re-calculate.

λ = ln(2) / 5730 = 0.69314718056 / 5730 ≈ 0.00012097.

So t = (ln(15/6.6)) / λ → because A = A0 e^(-λt) → t = (ln(A0/A)) / λ.

Wait, wait a second. Because 6.6 =15 e^{-λ t} → 6.6/15 = e^{-λ t} → ln(6.6/15) = -λ t → t = ln(15/6.6)/λ.

Oh, wait! I think I made a mistake earlier. Because ln(6.6/15) is negative, so when I take the negative, it becomes positive. So the correct approach is to calculate t = ln(15/6.6) / λ.

Because 6.6 =15 e^{-λt} → 6.6/15 = e^{-λt} → ln(6.6/15)= -λt → t= - ln(6.6/15)/λ → which is the same as t = ln(15/6.6)/λ.

So let me compute ln(15/6.6) first.

15/6.6 is approximately 2.2727.

ln(2.2727) ≈ 0.82098.

So t = 0.82098 / 0.00012097 ≈ 6788 years.

Wait, same as before. So that's about 6,788 years. But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the numbers. Maybe the initial activity A0 is taken as 14 dpm/g? No, I thought it's 15. Wait, I should confirm.

I think the standard is 15. So 15 dpm/g is correct.

Alternatively, maybe the formula uses the Libby half-life or the current half-life. The Libby half-life is approximately 5,568 years, but the current accepted value is 5,730 years. But the formula uses the actual half-life, so 5,730 is correct.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the given activity is after 7,000 years, and the calculation would adjust it. But no, the calculation is correct as per the given data.

Looking back at the options, the closest is 6,750 (option A) and 6,788 is about 6,788. So 6,788 isn't an option, but perhaps I've made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Let me compute 15/6.6 = 2.272727.

ln(2.272727) = let me calculate it more accurately.

Using a calculator, ln(2) is 0.6931, ln(e) is about 1.6487, but wait, 2.2727 is higher than e (2.718). Wait, no, 2.2727 is less than e. So, more accurately, using a calculator, ln(2.2727) is approximately 0.82098.

So t = 0.82098 / (0.69314718056 / 5730) → because λ=0.69314718056/5730.

Let me compute that denominator first: 0.69314718056 / 5730 ≈ 0.00012097.

So 0.82098 / 0.00012097 → Let me compute this division step by step.

0.00012097 × 6,788 = 0.82098.

Wait, so 0.00012097 × 6,788 → 0.00012097 * 6,788.

Let me compute 6,788 × 0.00012097.

Compute 6,788 × 0.0001 = 0.6788.

6,788 × 0.00002097 = let's compute 6,788 × 0.00002 = 0.13576.

6,788 × 0.00000097 = approx 6,788 * 0.000001 = 0.006788, so 0.006788 * 0.97 ≈ 0.006588.

So 0.13576 + 0.006588 ≈ 0.142348.

So total is 0.6788 + 0.142348 = 0.821148.

Which is very close to 0.82098. So t ≈ 6,788 years.

But none of the options are 6,788. The closest is option A:6,750.

Wait, perhaps I should check if the formula uses the reciprocal?

Wait, no, the formula seems correct. Maybe I should look for an option that's around 6,788. Looking at the options, option A is 6,750, which is 38 years less than our calculation. Option H is 7,150, which is too high. Option F is 7,350, which is higher still. Option I is 6,400, which is lower.

Wait, perhaps the initial activity is different. Wait, what if A0 is 14.3 instead of 15? Let me try that.

14.3 is sometimes used as a standard. Let me recalculate with A0=14.3.

So 6.6 =14.3 e^{-λ t}.

6.6/14.3 ≈ 0.4609.

ln(0.4609)≈-0.7722.

Then t = 0.7722 / 0.00012097 → 0.7722 / 0.00012097 ≈ 6,383 → approx 6,383 years.

But that's not in the options either. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should use a calculator for more precise computation.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects me to use the formula t = (ln(A0/A)) * t_half / ln(2).

Wait, because λ = ln(2)/t_half → so 1/λ = t_half / ln(2).

So t = ln(A0/A) * (t_half / ln(2)).

Let me compute that.

A0 is 15, A is 6.6 → ln(15/6.6) = ln(2.2727) ≈0.82098.

t_half is 5,730.

So t = 0.82098 * (5,730 / 0.693147).

Compute 5,730 / 0.693147 ≈ 5,730 / 0.693147 ≈ 8,267.3.

Then, t =0.82098 *8,267.3 ≈ let's compute that.

0.8 *8,267.3 ≈6,613.8.

0.02098 *8,267.3 ≈ 173. So total ≈6,786.8 years.

Same as before, about 6,787 years.

But the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm miscalculating, or the question expects a different approach.

Wait, another thought. Maybe the given age of 7,000 years is correct within ±100 years, but the radiochemical method is giving a different age. Perhaps the question is testing the understanding that the activity is measured, and using that to find the age, but in this case, the calculated age is 6,787, which is not an option. So maybe I made a mistake in the initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps the given age is 7,000 years, and the activity is 6.6 dpm/g. Maybe the question is a trick question, and the correct answer is D:7,000 years, because that's the age determined by counting growth rings, and the radiochemical evidence is just confirming it. But that doesn't make sense because the activity would be lower than modern levels, so the age should be older than zero.

Wait, but no. The sample is 7,000 years old, which is much younger than the 5,730-year half-life, so the activity would be significantly lower than 15 dpm/g, but not extremely low.

Wait, let's compute what the expected activity would be for a 7,000-year-old sample.

Compute A =15 * e^(-λ *7000).

λ=0.00012097 per year.

λ*7000=0.84779.

e^(-0.84779)≈0.427.

So A=15 *0.427≈6.405 dpm/g. But the sample's activity is 6.6 dpm/g, which is higher than 6.405. That suggests the sample is younger than 7,000 years, because higher activity means less decay.

Wait, so if 7,000 years gives about 6.4 dpm/g, and the sample has 6.6, then the age should be younger than 7,000. So our initial calculation of about 6,788 is older than 7,000, which contradicts. Hmm, that's confusing.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me recalculate the activity at 7,000 years.

Compute λ*t =0.00012097 *7000=0.84779.

e^(-0.84779)= approximately 0.427.

So A=15 *0.427=6.405 dpm/g.

But the sample's activity is 6.6, which is higher than 6.405, so the sample must be younger than 7,000 years. So then why does our initial calculation using 6.6 dpm/g give an age of about 6,788, which is older than 7,000?

Wait, that doesn't make sense. There's a contradiction here. Let me think again.

Wait, no, because when you have higher activity, the age is younger. So if the sample's activity is 6.6, which is higher than the expected 6.405 at 7,000 years, the age should be less than 7,000, not more.

But according to the calculation using 6.6, the age is about 6,788, which is older than 7,000. That can't be right. So I must have made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, maybe I inverted the formula. Let me check.

The formula is A = A0 * e^(-λt). So if A is higher than the expected at t=7,000, that would mean that t is smaller than 7,000.

Wait, let me correct the calculation. Let me compute the age when A=6.6.

We have 6.6 =15 * e^(-λt).

So ln(6.6/15)=ln(0.44)= -0.82098= -λt → t=0.82098/λ.

λ=0.00012097.

So t=0.82098 /0.00012097≈6,788 years.

Wait, that's what I did before. So if the age is 6,788, which is older than 7,000, but at 7,000 years, the activity is 6.405, which is lower than 6.6. So this suggests that a higher activity corresponds to a younger age. So that would mean that 6,788 is older than 7,000, but that's impossible because 6,788 is less than 7,000. Wait, no—6,788 is less than 7,000? No, 6,788 is 6 thousand 7 hundred, so 6,788 is about 6.8 thousand, which is less than 7,000. So 6,788 years is younger than 7,000. So that makes sense because higher activity (6.6) than the 6.405 at 7,000 would imply a younger age.

So 6,788 is younger than 7,000, which fits because 6,788 is about 6.8k, which is 200 years less than 7k.

But looking back at the options, none of them are 6,788. The closest is option A:6,750 and option E:6,225.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it with more precise numbers.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula t = - (1/λ) * ln(A/A0).

So t = - (5730 / 0.693147) * ln(6.6/15).

Compute ln(6.6/15)=ln(0.44)= -0.82098.

So t= (5730/0.693147
