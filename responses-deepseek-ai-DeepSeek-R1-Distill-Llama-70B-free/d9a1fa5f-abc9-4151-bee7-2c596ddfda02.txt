Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about selecting a manager, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's break it down.

The question is asking about the selection procedures to use when hiring a manager. The options are A through D. I need to think about what qualities are important for a managerial role.

Option A lists marital status, place of birth, and favorite color. Hmm, those don't seem relevant. Marital status and place of birth could be discriminatory and aren't related to job performance. Favorite color is just personal preference, so A doesn't make sense.

Option B includes personality test results, social media presence, and volunteer work. Personality tests might give some insight into traits like leadership or teamwork. Volunteer work can show initiative and community involvement. Social media presence... I'm not sure. Maybe it's about how they present themselves online, but I don't know if that's a standard selection procedure for managers. It could be a red flag if someone has inappropriate content, but I'm not sure if it's a primary factor.

Option C has social maturity and breadth, intelligence, motivation and drive, human relations development, and leadership style. These all sound relevant. Social maturity would indicate how well they handle social situations and responsibilities. Intelligence is important for problem-solving. Motivation and drive are crucial for achieving goals. Human relations development suggests good interpersonal skills, which are key for managing people. Leadership style directly relates to how they'll manage the team. This option seems comprehensive and focused on the right areas.

Option D is height, weight, zodiac sign, and shoe size. These are all physical attributes or unrelated factors. None of these relate to managerial skills, so D is out.

So, the correct answer should be the one that focuses on relevant qualities for a manager. Option C fits because it covers aspects that are directly related to leadership and management effectiveness.
