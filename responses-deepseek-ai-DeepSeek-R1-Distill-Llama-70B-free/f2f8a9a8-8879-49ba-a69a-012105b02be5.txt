Okay, so I have this question about the Pleistocene epoch and when it ended. I'm a bit rusty on my geologic time scales, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, I remember that the geological time scale is divided into eons, eras, periods, and epochs. The Pleistocene is an epoch within the Cenozoic era, which is the current era. I think the Cenozoic is divided into several epochs, with the Pleistocene being one of the more recent ones before the current Holocene.

Wait, when did the Pleistocene start and end? I recall that the Pleistocene was characterized by ice ages, so it's often called the Ice Age epoch. I think it started around 2.6 million years ago. But the question is about when it ended, specifically how long ago that was.

I remember that the Pleistocene ended at the beginning of the Holocene. The Holocene is the current epoch we're living in. From what I've read before, the transition from Pleistocene to Holocene happened about 11,700 years ago. That's roughly 11.7 thousand years ago.

Looking at the options, option J is 10,000 years. That's close to 11.7, so maybe they rounded it down. Let me think if any of the other options are closer. Option I is 20,000, which is further away. Option H is 5,000, which is closer but still not as close as 10,000. So I think the correct answer is J: 10,000 years.

Wait, but wait another thought. Sometimes dates can be approximate, and perhaps in some sources, they might round to 10,000 instead of 11,700. Yeah, I think that's the case here. So the Pleistocene ended about 10,000 years ago.

The Pleistocene epoch ended approximately 11,700 years ago, marking the transition to the Holocene epoch. Among the given options, the closest and most appropriate choice is 10,000 years ago. 

Answer: J
