Question:

Four years ago the owner of a shopping center leased a store in the center for a 10-year term to a pharmacistfor use as a drugstore. The pharmacist established and operated a drugstore at the leased premises. The leaseincluded provisions that described the shopping center by metes and bounds; identified the entrances, parkingareas, signs, and other common facilities of the shopping center; and set out a covenant that the owner wouldnot lease any part of the shopping center to another drugstore. Last year the owner purchased a parcel of land immediately adjacent to the shopping center. That parcel wasimproved with a building that, at the time of the owner's purchase and for ten years earlier, was occupied inpart by a food supermarket and in part by a discount drugstore, under leases which the prior owner assignedto the owner. The owner reconstructed the common facilities of both shopping centers to integrate them and combine themso that, to the public, the two centers appeared as a larger single development. The pharmacist learned that the lease of the discount drugstore was about to expire and that the ownerplanned to enter into a new lease of the same space with the discount drugstore. The pharmacist protested the proposed new lease, but the owner declared his intention to go forward with it. The pharmacist brought an appropriate action to enjoin the new lease to the discount drugstore as a violationof the covenant in the pharmacist's lease. If the court finds for the owner, what will be the likely reason?

Options:

A: The covenant does not apply to the owner's actions as he did not directly lease the space to another drugstore but bought a property which already had a lease with a drugstore.
B: The owner's purchase and integration of the adjacent parcel of land effectively nullifies the existing covenant.
C: The drugstore use on the adjacent parcel was in existence when the owner and the pharmacist firstentered into the lease.
D: The discount drugstore on the adjacent parcel is not considered a 'new' lease, but a continuation of an existing one.
E: A covenant cannot restrict the use of land not owned by the covenantor when the covenant wascreated.
F: The owner has the right to lease any part of his property to any business, regardless of existing leases.
G: The pharmacist did not adequately express his concerns to the owner before initiating legal action.
H: A covenant that attempts to restrict competition is invalid as against public policy even if it runs with theland.
I: The covenant in the pharmacist's lease can be fairly construed as to apply only to the original shoppingcenter premises.
J: The covenant is not applicable as the shopping centers were considered separate entities at the time of the lease agreement.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about real estate law, specifically about lease covenants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the scenario is about a shopping center owner who leased a store to a pharmacist for 10 years. The lease included a covenant that the owner wouldn't lease any part of the shopping center to another drugstore. So, the pharmacist has a drugstore there, and the lease says no other drugstores in the shopping center.

Four years later, the owner buys an adjacent parcel of land. This land has a building that's partly a supermarket and partly a discount drugstore. The prior owner had leases for these, which the current owner took over. Then, the owner reconstructs the common facilities to integrate both shopping areas, making them appear as one big development to the public.

Now, the pharmacist finds out that the discount drugstore's lease is about to expire, and the owner plans to renew it with the same store. The pharmacist protests, saying this violates the covenant in their lease. But the owner says he's going ahead. The pharmacist sues to stop the new lease, but the court sides with the owner. Why?

Looking at the options, I need to figure out which reason would make the court rule for the owner.

Option A says the covenant doesn't apply because the owner didn't lease to another drugstore directly; he bought a property that already had a drugstore lease. Wait, but the covenant was about not leasing any part of the shopping center to another drugstore. The owner is now leasing part of the new parcel, which is integrated into the same shopping center. So maybe this isn't about direct leasing, but more about the covenant's scope.

Option B suggests the purchase and integration nullify the covenant. That doesn't seem right because usually, covenants run with the land and are binding on subsequent owners, especially if they touch and concern the land.

Option C points out that the drugstore on the adjacent parcel was there when the pharmacist leased. But the covenant was made at the time of the pharmacist's lease, so the existing drugstore might have been a problem, but the owner didn't create a new one then. Wait, no, the owner bought the adjacent land later, so when the original lease was made, the other drugstore wasn't part of the same shopping center. So maybe that's a point.

Option D says the discount drugstore's lease isn't new but a continuation. But the pharmacist's lease is about not leasing to another drugstore. If the new lease is a renewal, maybe that's different. But the question says the lease is about to expire and the owner plans to enter a new lease. So D might not apply.

Option E claims a covenant can't restrict land not owned by the covenantor when created. Hmm, the covenant was about the shopping center. When the owner bought the adjacent land, he became the owner, so maybe the covenant doesn't apply to that new land. Because the covenant was made when the owner only owned the original shopping center. So the covenant might only cover that original area.

Option F says the owner can lease to anyone regardless of existing leases. That doesn't sound right because lease covenants are enforceable, so F is probably incorrect.

Option G is about the pharmacist not expressing concerns before suing. Procedural issues, but the question is about the covenant's validity, not procedure.

Option H says covenants restricting competition are invalid. I think some covenants, like non-competes, can be enforceable depending on the situation. But in real estate, covenants that restrict use are common, like in shopping centers to prevent too much competition.

Option I suggests the covenant applies only to the original premises. That makes sense because when the covenant was made, the owner didn't own the adjacent land. So the covenant would only cover the original shopping center, not the new parcel, even after integration.

Option J says the centers were separate at the time of the lease, so the covenant doesn't apply. That might align with I, but it's phrased differently.

So, between E, I, and J.

E says the covenant can't restrict land not owned by the covenantor when the covenant was created. So, when the covenant was made, the owner didn't own the adjacent land. Therefore, the covenant only applies to the original shopping center. When the owner bought the adjacent land, the covenant doesn't cover that new parcel, even if they integrated them later. So the owner can lease the new parcel as he wishes.

Alternatively, option I says the covenant can be fairly construed to apply only to the original premises. That would mean the owner is free to lease the adjacent parcel, even after integrating.

So which is it? If the lease described the shopping center by metes and bounds, including the original area, then the covenant is limited to that. The adjacent parcel wasn't part of that description, so the covenant doesn't apply there. Even after integrating, the covenant's original terms wouldn't automatically expand to include the new parcel.

So, the court might find that the covenant in the pharmacist's lease doesn't cover the adjacent parcel because it wasn't part of the original shopping center as described. Therefore, the owner isn't violating the covenant by leasing to the discount drugstore in the new area.

Looking at the options, I think I is the correct answer. The covenant applies only to the original premises, so the owner can lease the adjacent parcel as part of the expanded center without violating the covenant.

The question revolves around whether a covenant in a lease, which prohibits the owner from leasing any part of the shopping center to another drugstore, applies to an adjacent parcel of land purchased later and integrated into the original shopping center. The pharmacist argues that renewing the lease with the discount drugstore on the adjacent parcel violates this covenant. However, the court sides with the owner, and the likely reason is that the covenant was originally limited to the shopping center as described in the lease.

At the time the covenant was created, the owner did not own the adjacent parcel, and the lease described the shopping center by metes and bounds, which did not include the adjacent parcel. Even though the owner later purchased the adjacent parcel and integrated the two properties, the covenant's original scope was limited to the premises described in the lease. Therefore, the covenant does not apply to the adjacent parcel, and the owner is free to lease it to the discount drugstore without violating the covenant.

The correct answer is:

I: The covenant in the pharmacist's lease can be fairly construed as to apply only to the original shopping center premises.

Answer: I
