Okay, so I've got this physics question in front of me about gravitational force between two objects. Hmm, I remember that Newton's law of universal gravitation is involved here. Let me think. The formula is F = G*(m1*m2)/r², right? Where G is the gravitational constant, m1 and m2 are the masses, and r is the distance between their centers.

The question says that each mass is doubled, and the distance is also doubled. I need to find out what happens to the force. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's consider the masses. If each mass is doubled, then m1 becomes 2m1 and m2 becomes 2m2. So when I multiply them together, 2m1 * 2m2 equals 4*(m1*m2). So the product of the masses becomes four times larger.

Now, the distance is also doubled. The original distance is r, so the new distance is 2r. In the formula, the distance is squared. So the denominator becomes (2r)², which is 4r². 

Putting it all together, the new force F' would be G*(4m1m2)/(4r²). Let me compute that: 4 divided by 4 is 1, so F' = G*(m1m2)/(r²). Wait, that's the same as the original force F. So the force remains the same.

Wait, did I do that right? Let me double-check. Original F is G*(m1*m2)/r². After changes, F' is G*(2m1 * 2m2)/(2r)^2. So (2*2)=4 in the numerator, denominator (2)^2=4. So 4/4 cancels out, leaving F'= G*(m1*m2)/r², which is same as F. So the force remains unchanged.

Looking at the options, option B says it remains the same. So the answer should be B.

To determine what happens to the gravitational force between two objects when the mass of each object is doubled and the distance between their centers is doubled, we use Newton's law of gravitation:

\[
F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}
\]

Here, \( F \) is the gravitational force, \( G \) is the gravitational constant, \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) are the masses of the objects, and \( r \) is the distance between their centers.

1. **Doubling the masses**: If the mass of each object is doubled, the new masses become \( 2m_1 \) and \( 2m_2 \). The product of the masses in the numerator becomes:
   \[
   (2m_1)(2m_2) = 4m_1m_2
   \]
   This increases the numerator by a factor of 4.

2. **Doubling the distance**: If the distance between the centers is doubled, the new distance becomes \( 2r \). The denominator, which is the square of the distance, becomes:
   \[
   (2r)^2 = 4r^2
   \]
   This increases the denominator by a factor of 4.

3. **Combining the changes**: Substituting these changes into the formula, the new force \( F' \) is:
   \[
   F' = G \frac{4m_1m_2}{4r^2}
   \]
   Simplifying, the factors of 4 in the numerator and denominator cancel out:
   \[
   F' = G \frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}
   \]
   This shows that the new force \( F' \) is equal to the original force \( F \).

Thus, the gravitational force remains unchanged when the masses and distance are both doubled. The correct answer is:

**B: It remains the same.**
