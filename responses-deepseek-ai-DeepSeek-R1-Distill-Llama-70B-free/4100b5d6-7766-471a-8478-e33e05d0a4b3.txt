Question:

An eager AP Biology student interested in studying osmosis and the movement of water in solutions took a dialysis bag containing a 0.5 M solution and placed it into a beaker containing a 0.6 M solution. If this bag were instead placed into a beaker of distilled water, what would be the expected result?

Options:

A: The bag will expand and eventually burst due to the pressure of water flow.
B: The solute will flow into the dialysis bag from the beaker.
C: The bag will remain the exact same size because no water will move at all.
D: The bag will shrink in size and the beaker will overflow due to the movement of water.
E: The solute will flow out of the dialysis bag into the beaker.
F: The water will evaporate from the bag, leaving only the solute.
G: There will be a net flow of water into the bag, causing it to swell in size.
H: There will be a net flow of water out of the beaker, causing it to decrease in size.
I: The water in the bag will freeze due to the change in environment.
J: There will be a net flow of water out of the bag, causing it to decrease in size.

Okay, so I've got this biology question about osmosis, and I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question says that there's a dialysis bag with a 0.5 M solution placed into a beaker with a 0.6 M solution. Then, the question changes the scenario: what if instead, the dialysis bag is placed into distilled water? I need to figure out what happens then.

First, I remember that osmosis is the movement of water from a region of lower solute concentration to higher solute concentration through a semipermeable membrane. The dialysis bag acts as that semipermeable membrane, allowing water to pass but keeping the solute (assuming it's a larger molecule) inside.

In the initial setup, the bag is in a 0.6 M solution. The bag's solution is 0.5 M, which is lower than 0.6. So, water would move from the bag (lower concentration) to the beaker (higher). Wait, noâ€”wait, no. Wait, no. Wait, no: when you have a solution inside the bag and another outside, the water moves from the lower solute concentration to the higher. So if the inside is 0.5 M and the outside is 0.6 M, the outside has higher concentration. So water will leave the bag, moving into the higher concentration outside. Wait, I'm getting confused here.

Wait, no. Osmosis is water moving from lower solute concentration to higher. So if the inside of the bag is 0.5 M and the outside is 0.6 M, the outside has higher solute. So water will flow from inside (lower solute, 0.5) to outside (higher, 0.6) through the membrane. So the bag would lose water, causing it to shrink.

But the question is about putting the same bag into distilled water. Distilled water is 0 M, right? So the inside of the bag is 0.5 M, higher than the outside (0 M). So water would flow into the bag, because the bag's solution is higher in solute. So in this case, water moves from beaker (distilled, low solute) into the bag (higher solute, 0.5 M). So the bag would gain water, causing it to swell or expand.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one reflects a net flow of water into the bag.

Option G says: There will be a net flow of water into the bag, causing it to swell in size. That sounds correct.

Option J says net flow out, which would make the bag shrink, but that's the initial scenario when it's in 0.6 M. But in this case, when in water, it's the opposite.

Other options: A says the bag expands and bursts. That's possible if too much water enters, but the question asks for the expected result, which is the direction, not whether it bursts. So G is more precise.

Option E says solute flows out. But the dialysis bag's membrane probably doesn't allow solute to pass, so that's not likely.

So the answer should be G.

When a dialysis bag containing a 0.5 M solution is placed into distilled water (0 M), osmosis will occur. Osmosis is the movement of water from a region of lower solute concentration to a region of higher solute concentration through a semipermeable membrane. In this case, the inside of the bag has a higher solute concentration (0.5 M) compared to the distilled water outside (0 M). As a result, water will flow into the bag from the beaker, causing the bag to swell in size.

Analyzing the options:

- **G** correctly states that there will be a net flow of water into the bag, causing it to swell. This aligns with the principles of osmosis.
- **J** incorrectly suggests water will flow out of the bag, which would occur if the bag were placed in a solution with a higher solute concentration, but that is not the case here.
- Other options either describe incorrect phenomena or are less precise than **G**.

Thus, the correct answer is:

G: There will be a net flow of water into the bag, causing it to swell in size.

Answer: G
