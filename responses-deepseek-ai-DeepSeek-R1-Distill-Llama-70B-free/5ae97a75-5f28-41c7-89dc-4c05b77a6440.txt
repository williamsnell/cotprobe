Question:

Nelson, et al. (Science 238, 1670 (1987)) examined several weakly bound gas-phase complexes of ammonia in search of examples in which the $\mathrm{H}$ atoms in $\mathrm{NH}_3$ formed hydrogen bonds, but found none. For example, they found that the complex of $\mathrm{NH}_3$ and $\mathrm{CO}_2$ has the carbon atom nearest the nitrogen (299 pm away): the $\mathrm{CO}_2$ molecule is at right angles to the $\mathrm{C}-\mathrm{N}$ 'bond', and the $\mathrm{H}$ atoms of $\mathrm{NH}_3$ are pointing away from the $\mathrm{CO}_2$. The magnitude of the permanent dipole moment of this complex is reported as $1.77 \mathrm{D}$. If the $\mathrm{N}$ and $\mathrm{C}$ atoms are the centres of the negative and positive charge distributions, respectively, what is the magnitude of those partial charges (as multiples of $e$ )?

Options:

A: 0.150
B:  0.123
C: 0.135
D: 0.098
E: 0.157
F: 0.091
G: 0.112
H: 0.176
I: 0.204
J: 0.085

Okay, so I've got this question about partial charges in a complex made of ammonia and carbon dioxide. Hmm, I remember from my chemistry classes that dipole moments are related to charge separation. Let me think about how to approach this.

The question says that the dipole moment of the NH3-CO2 complex is 1.77 D. They're asking for the magnitude of the partial charges, assuming N is the center of negative charge and C is positive. So, I guess I need to calculate the charges based on the dipole moment and the distance between N and C.

Wait, what do I know about dipole moments? The formula is μ = q * d, where μ is the dipole moment, q is the charge, and d is the distance between the charges. Oh right, but I have to make sure the units are compatible. 

The distance given is 299 pm. I should convert that to meters because dipole moments are usually in Debyes, and 1 Debye is about 3.33564e-30 C·m. So let's see, 299 pm is 299e-12 meters. 

The charges are q and -q, right? Because the total dipole is the product of charge and separation. So the dipole moment μ is equal to q * d. Wait, but wait, the dipole moment is a vector, but since the charges are in opposite directions, the magnitude would just be q*d.

So I can rearrange the formula to solve for q: q = μ / d.

But wait, the dipole moment given is in Debyes. So I need to convert that to C·m units. Let me recall the conversion factor. 1 D is approximately 3.33564e-30 C·m. So 1.77 D is 1.77 * 3.33564e-30 C·m.

Let me calculate that. 1.77 * 3.33564e-30 = let's see. 1.77 * 3 is 5.31, 1.77 * 0.33564 is about 0.594. So total is approximately 5.904e-30 C·m. Wait, wait, no, because 3.33564e-30 is approximately 3.336e-30. So 1.77 multiplied by that is 1.77 * 3.336e-30. Let me compute that precisely: 1.77 * 3.336 is about 5.911e-30? Wait, 1.77 * 3 is 5.31, 1.77 * 0.336 is around 0.595. So 5.31 + 0.595 is 5.905, so 5.905e-30 C·m.

Now, the distance d is 299 pm, which is 299e-12 m. So plug into q = μ / d. So q = (5.905e-30 C·m) / (299e-12 m) = (5.905e-30) / (2.99e-10) C.

Let me compute that. 5.905e-30 divided by 2.99e-10 is approximately (5.905 / 2.99) * 1e-20. 5.905 divided by 3 is about 1.968, but since it's 2.99, which is almost 3, maybe a bit less. Let's compute 5.905 / 2.99.

2.99 times 1.975 is about 5.905? Let me check: 2.99 * 1.975 = 2.99 * (2 - 0.025) = 5.98 - (2.99 * 0.025). 2.99 * 0.025 is about 0.07475. So 5.98 - 0.07475 is approximately 5.905. So that gives me 1.975e-20 C.

Wait, wait, but wait. Wait, 5.905e-30 divided by 2.99e-10 is (5.905 / 2.99) * 1e-20, right? Because 1e-30 / 1e-10 is 1e-20.

So that gives me approximately 1.975e-20 C. But we need to express the charge as a multiple of the elementary charge e. Because the question asks for the partial charges as multiples of e.

So e is the elementary charge, approximately 1.602e-19 C. So to find q in terms of e, I divide q by e.

So q/e = (1.975e-20 C) / (1.602e-19 C/e) = (1.975 / 1.602) * (1e-20 / 1e-19) ) = (1.232) * (0.1) = approximately 0.1232.

Okay, so that's about 0.123, which is option B.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because I might have made an error somewhere.

So:

μ = 1.77 D = 1.77 * 3.33564e-30 C·m = let's compute that exactly.

1.77 * 3.33564e-30:

1.77 * 3 = 5.31, 1.77 * 0.33564 = 0.594 (exactly, 0.33564 * 1.77 = 0.594).

So 5.31 + 0.594 = 5.904e-30 C·m.

d = 299 pm = 299e-12 m.

So q = μ / d = 5.904e-30 / 299e-12 = (5.904 / 299) * 1e-18.

Wait, 5.904 / 299 is approximately 0.01975.

So 0.01975 * 1e-18 C = 1.975e-20 C.

Then, q/e = (1.975e-20 C) / (1.602e-19 C/e) = (1.975 / 1.602) * (1e-20 / 1e-19) ) = (1.232) * (0.1) ) = 0.1232.

So that's about 0.123, which is option B.

Wait, but wait another thing. The dipole moment is the product of the charge and the distance between them. So if the charges are -q and +q, then the dipole moment is q * d. So that part is correct.

So the calculation seems right. So the answer should be B: 0.123.

To determine the magnitude of the partial charges in the NH₃-CO₂ complex, we use the relationship between dipole moment (μ), charge (q), and distance (d):  

\[
\mu = q \cdot d
\]

### Step 1: Convert the dipole moment to C·m  
The given dipole moment is \( \mu = 1.77 \, \mathrm{D} \). Using the conversion factor \( 1 \, \mathrm{D} = 3.33564 \times 10^{-30} \, \mathrm{C \cdot m} \), we calculate:  
\[
\mu = 1.77 \cdot 3.33564 \times 10^{-30} = 5.905 \times 10^{-30} \, \mathrm{C \cdot m}.
\]

### Step 2: Convert the distance to meters  
The distance between the nitrogen and carbon atoms is \( d = 299 \, \mathrm{pm} \). Converting to meters:  
\[
d = 299 \times 10^{-12} = 2.99 \times 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m}.
\]

### Step 3: Solve for the charge  
Rearranging the formula \( \mu = q \cdot d \) to solve for \( q \):  
\[
q = \frac{\mu}{d} = \frac{5.905 \times 10^{-30}}{2.99 \times 10^{-10}}.
\]

Performing the division:  
\[
q = \frac{5.905}{2.99} \times 10^{-20} \approx 1.975 \times 10^{-20} \, \mathrm{C}.
\]

### Step 4: Express the charge as a multiple of \( e \)  
The elementary charge is \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{C} \). To express \( q \) as a multiple of \( e \):  
\[
\frac{q}{e} = \frac{1.975 \times 10^{-20}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} = \frac{1.975}{1.602} \times 10^{-1} \approx 0.123.
\]

### Final Answer  
The magnitude of the partial charges, as multiples of \( e \), is approximately \( 0.123 \).
