Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. 

The problem says there's a store with 3 boxes of shirts. Each box has 4 packages, and each package contains 7 shirts. The expression given to find the total number of shirts is 3 × (4 × 7). I need to find another expression from the options that can also calculate the total number of shirts.

Hmm, so let me break this down. The original expression is 3 multiplied by the result of 4 multiplied by 7. So that's 3×(4×7). Since multiplication is associative, I can rearrange the numbers as long as the order of multiplication stays the same. Wait, no, actually, because multiplication is commutative and associative, the order and grouping can change without affecting the result.

So, 3×(4×7) is the same as (3×4)×7 or 4×(3×7), right? Because associativity allows us to group them differently, and commutativity means the order can change. So the problem is asking for another expression that gives the same product.

Let me compute the original expression first to know the target number. 4 times 7 is 28, and then 3 times 28 is 84. So the total number of shirts is 84. Now I need to find which of the options also equals 84.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 14 × 3. Let's see, 14×3 is 42. That's not 84. So A is out.

Option B: 21 ×4. 21×4 is 84. Oh, that's a candidate. But I'll check all options to be sure.

Option C: 12 ×7. 12×7 is 84. Hmm, another possibility.

Option D: 7 ×12. Same as C, because multiplication is commutative. So that's also 84.

Option E: 14 ×4 is 56. Not 84.

Option F: 4 ×21 is 84. So that's another one.

Option G: 12 ×3 is 36. No.

Option H: 28 ×4. 28×4 is 112. That's double the needed number. No.

Option I:28 ×7 is 196. No, way too high.

Option J:21 ×3 is 63. No.

Wait, so the options that give 84 are B, C, D, F. Let me check if I did the math right.

Wait, original expression was 3×(4×7) = 3×28=84.

Option B: 21×4=84. Yes.

Option C: 12×7=84.

Option D:7×12=84.

Option F:4×21=84.

Wait, so multiple options seem correct. But the question is to choose which expression can also be used. So the problem is probably looking for an expression that's a rearrangement of the original factors.

The original factors are 3, 4, 7. So any grouping or order of these as long as all are multiplied together.

Wait, but the options might not all have all three numbers. Let me check the options again.

Wait, no, the original expression is 3*(4*7). So 3,4,7 are all factors. So any expression that is a permutation of these numbers in any grouping would work.

Let's look at the options. 

Option B: 21×4. 21 is 3×7, so 21×4 is (3×7)×4 = 3×4×7. So yes, same as original.

Option C:12×7. 12 is 3×4, so 12×7 is (3×4)×7 =3×4×7.

Option D:7×12. Same as C, because 7×12 is 84.

Option F:4×21. 21 is 3×7, so 4×(3×7) = same as original.

So all these options are correct. But wait, the question says "which expression can also be used", implying there might be more than one correct, but the options probably have only one correct answer. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the original expression is 3 × (4 ×7). So the multiplication is grouped as 3 × (28). The other expressions must have a different grouping but same product.

Wait, but the question is phrased as, which expression can also be used. So let's see the expressions.

Wait, perhaps the options are designed so that only one is correct, but according to my calculations, multiple options yield 84. So maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let's recompute each option:

Option A:14×3 → 14×3=42.

Option B:21×4 → 21×4=84.

Option C:12×7→84.

Option D:7×12=84.

Option E:14×4=56.

Option F:4×21=84.

Option G:12×3=36.

Option H:28×4=112.

Option I:28×7=196.

Option J:21×3=63.

So four options (B, C, D, F) give 84. But the question expects one correct answer.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the way the expression is structured. The original expression groups 4×7 first, then multiplies by 3. So an alternative expression might group 3×4 first, then multiply by 7. Or group 3×7 first, then multiply by 4. So which of the options match these structures.

Looking at option F:4×21. 21 is 3×7, so 4×(3×7) → same as 3×4×7.

Option C:12×7. 12 is 3×4, so (3×4)×7.

Option B:21×4. 21 is 3×7, so (3×7)×4.

Option D:7×12. Same as C.

So all these are correct. But the options can only have one correct answer, I think. Wait, maybe I need to see how the original expression is structured. The original is 3×(4×7). So the correct alternative would be any expression that correctly represents the same multiplication but in a different grouping.

But perhaps the question is looking for an expression that groups differently but uses the same numbers. So in the options, the correct ones are those that have all three numbers multiplied together, but perhaps without the parentheses.

Wait, perhaps the question is testing the associative property, so any regrouping would work. So the correct answer could be any of the options that multiply all three numbers together in some order, with or without parentheses.

But in the options given, some don't have all three numbers. Wait, no, all options are two numbers multiplied together. So the original expression is 3×(4×7) → which is 3×28=84. So any expression that equals 84 is acceptable.

So the options B, C, D, F all give 84. So why are there four options correct? Perhaps the question expects one, but I might have to look again.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the original problem. Let me read it again.

The store has 3 boxes, each with 4 packages, each package has 7 shirts. Expression: 3 × (4 ×7) → which is 3×28=84.

So the total shirts are 84. So any expression that equals 84 is correct.

But let's look at how each option is structured.

Option B:21 ×4. 21 is 3×7. So (3×7) ×4 = 3×4×7.

Option F:4 ×21. Same as B.

Option C:12 ×7. 12 is 3×4 → (3×4) ×7.

Option D:7 ×12. Same as C.

So all of them are correct. But the options only have one correct answer. Hmm, perhaps in the actual test, only one option is correct. Wait, in the options, perhaps the correct answers are B and F and C and D. But the question asks which expression can also be used, so any of them is correct. But in the given options, perhaps all four are correct.

But the user hasn't provided the options beyond J. The options are labeled A to J.

Wait, but in the initial problem statement, maybe I need to pick all correct options, but the problem specifies "which expression can also be used", implying only one correct choice. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, let me double-check each option's product.

Option B: 21 ×4 → 21*4=84. Correct.

Option C:12 ×7 → 12*7=84. Correct.

Option D:7 ×12 → same as C, 84.

Option F:4 ×21 → same as B, 84.

So all four options B, C, D, F yield 84. So how come the answer isn't among these? Maybe the intended answer is one of them. Perhaps the question expects the one that groups the same as the original, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the problem is looking for an expression without parentheses, but the same numbers. So 3×4×7. But the options don't have that. So perhaps the correct way is to find an expression that's a rearrangement, like 4×3×7, but the options have two numbers multiplied together.

Wait, but the options are all in the form of two numbers multiplied. So for example, 3×4×7 is 84, but the options only have expressions like 21×4, which is (3×7) ×4.

So all the four options are correct. But the problem expects one correct answer. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the order of operations or the way the numbers are grouped. Let me reevaluate the original problem.

Wait, perhaps the original problem is 3 × (4 ×7), and the alternative should also have the same grouping but different order. For instance, 4 × (3 ×7) would be 4×21, which is option F.

Alternatively, 7 × (3 ×4) would be 7×12, which is option D or C.

Or 3 × (7 ×4), which is same as original.

So all of these are correct.

But since the question gives multiple options that are correct, perhaps the intended answer is option F, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think differently. Let's compute each option:

The total shirts are 84. So which options equal 84?

Option B:21×4=84.

Option C:12×7=84.

Option D:7×12=84.

Option F:4×21=84.

So all four are correct.

But the answer choices only allow one answer. So perhaps the intended answer is one of these, maybe option F.

Wait, perhaps the original expression is 3×(4×7). So another expression could be 4×(3×7)=4×21, which is option F. So that's another way to group the same factors.

Alternatively, 3×4×7 can be grouped as (3×4)×7 =12×7, which is option C.

So both C and F are correct.

But the problem might choose one of them as the correct answer. Let me look back at the options given. The options are A to J, as listed.

Well, the correct options are B, C, D, F. But the problem expects one correct answer, so perhaps I'm supposed to pick the first correct option. Or perhaps the intended answer is option F. Alternatively, maybe the problem is designed so that only one option is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial calculation. Let me recheck. 3×(4×7) = 3×28=84.

So any expression that equals 84 is correct. So the correct options here are B, C, D, and F.

But in the given options, all four exist. So perhaps the correct answer is one of them, but I'm to choose one. In that case, perhaps I should look for the expression that is structurally similar but just regrouped.

Wait, the original is 3×(4×7). So an alternative could be (3×4) ×7 =12×7, which is option C. Or 4×(3×7)=4×21, option F.

So both C and F are correct. But the options are separate. So perhaps the answer is option F.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option F.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think about how the expressions are written. The original is 3 multiplied by (4×7). So any expression that has the same factors multiplied in a different grouping would be acceptable.

Looking back, the answer options include F:4×21. So that's 4*(3*7), which is the same as the original.

So I think the correct answer is F.

Wait, but earlier I thought B, C, D, F all give 84. But the question is asking which expression can also be used, so any of them is correct. But perhaps the intended answer is F because it's grouping the same way as the original but with different factors.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is B because 21×4 is (3×7)×4, which is the same as 3×4×7.

Wait, perhaps I should just pick the first correct option. So looking at the options in order, B is the first correct one.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option F. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question expects the use of the same numbers but grouped differently without rearranging the order of the numbers. The original is 3*(4*7). So another way is 4*(3*7) which is 4*21, which is option F.

Alternatively, 7*(3*4)=7*12, which is option C or D.

So both F and C are correct.

But since the options are separate, perhaps both F and C are correct.

Wait, but the problem expects one answer. So perhaps the intended answer is F.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option F.

Well, I think I've spent enough time thinking about this. I'll go with option F as the answer.

The problem involves finding the total number of shirts in a store with 3 boxes, each containing 4 packages of 7 shirts. The given expression is \( 3 \times (4 \times 7) \), which calculates the total as \( 3 \times 28 = 84 \). The task is to identify another expression from the options that also equals 84.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Original Expression**: \( 3 \times (4 \times 7) = 3 \times 28 = 84 \).
2. **Target**: Find an expression that also equals 84.
3. **Options Analysis**:
   - **A: \( 14 \times 3 = 42 \)** → Incorrect.
   - **B: \( 21 \times 4 = 84 \)** → Correct (equivalent to \( (3 \times 7) \times 4 \)).
   - **C: \( 12 \times 7 = 84 \)** → Correct (equivalent to \( (3 \times 4) \times 7 \)).
   - **D: \( 7 \times 12 = 84 \)** → Correct (same as C, due to commutativity).
   - **E: \( 14 \times 4 = 56 \)** → Incorrect.
   - **F: \( 4 \times 21 = 84 \)** → Correct (equivalent to \( 4 \times (3 \times 7) \)).
   - **G: \( 12 \times 3 = 36 \)** → Incorrect.
   - **H: \( 28 \times 4 = 112 \)** → Incorrect.
   - **I: \( 28 \times 7 = 196 \)** → Incorrect.
   - **J: \( 21 \times 3 = 63 \)** → Incorrect.

4. **Conclusion**: Options B, C, D, and F all yield 84. However, the question asks for "which expression can also be used," implying a single answer. Among these, \( 4 \times 21 \) (Option F) is a valid and logical choice, as it directly mirrors the structure of the original expression with a different grouping.

### Final Answer:
F
