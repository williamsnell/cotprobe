Okay, so I've got this question about Dworkin's Justice for Hedgehogs. I'm a bit fuzzy on my legal philosophy, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which statement best describes one of Dworkin's central arguments in that book. The options are A through J. Let me try to recall what I know about Dworkin and his theories.

From what I remember, Ronald Dworkin was a prominent legal philosopher. His work often deals with the relationship between law and morality. In "Justice for Hedgehogs," I think he argues that moral values are objective and that they play a significant role in the legal system.

Wait, so he's against legal positivism, which tends to separate law and morality. Instead, Dworkin believes that law is deeply connected with moral principles. But how does that translate into the options here?

Looking at the options:

Option A: The law is the only guide for ethical behaviour. Hmm, I don't think so. Dworkin doesn't say that law is the only guide; he probably sees morality as a separate but related concept.

Option B: The law dictates what moral values should affect our ethical behaviour. Not sure. I think Dworkin argues that law incorporates moral values, but maybe not that it dictates them.

Option C: Morality plays no role in the concept of law. No, that's the opposite of what Dworkin would say. He believes morality is integral to law.

Option D: Moral arguments operate only in hard cases. I think he argues that moral principles are always part of legal reasoning, not just in hard cases.

Option E: Morality only applies to specific, complex cases. No, same issue as D. Dworkin probably sees morality as pervasive in legal decisions.

Option F: Legal principles should not be influenced by moral values. That sounds like legal positivism again, which Dworkin opposes.

Option G: Moral values are both independent and objective. This rings a bell. Dworkin does argue for the objectivity of moral values, right? He believes that moral statements can be true or false, and they're not just subjective.

Option H: Law and morality are entirely separate entities with no overlap. No, that's the opposite of his view. He thinks they are intertwined.

Option I: Morality is subjective and changes over time. I don't think so. If G is correct, then I must be wrong.

Option J: Ethical behaviour is independent of moral values. That doesn't make sense. Ethical behavior is based on moral values, so this can't be right.

Putting this together, the correct answer is probably G. Dworkin argues that moral values are both independent (they exist regardless of human opinion) and objective (they have a truth value).

The question asks which statement best describes one of Ronald Dworkin's central arguments in *Justice for Hedgehogs*. Based on Dworkin's legal philosophy, he emphasizes the objectivity of moral values and their integral role in the legal system. He argues against legal positivism, which separates law and morality, and instead posits that moral values are both independent and objective. This aligns with option G, which states, "Moral values are both independent and objective."

Other options are inconsistent with Dworkin's views. For example, options A, B, and F suggest that law dictates or excludes morality, which contradicts Dworkin's belief in the intertwined nature of law and morality. Options C, D, and E incorrectly limit morality's role or suggest its subjectivity, which Dworkin opposes. Option H claims law and morality are entirely separate, which is the opposite of Dworkin's position, and option J misunderstands the relationship between ethics and morality.

Thus, the correct answer is:

G: Moral values are both independent and objective.

Answer: G
