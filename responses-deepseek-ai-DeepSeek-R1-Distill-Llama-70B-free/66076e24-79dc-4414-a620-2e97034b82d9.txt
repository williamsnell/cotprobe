Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see, the question is about finding the pH of a solution made by dissolving hypochlorous acid (HClO) in water. I remember that pH relates to the acidity of the solution, so I need to find out how much HClO dissociates in water.

First, the problem gives me the moles of HClO, which is 0.1665 mole, and the volume of solution is 500 mL. I think the first thing I should do is calculate the concentration of HClO. Concentration is moles divided by liters, right? So 500 mL is 0.5 liters. Let me do that calculation: 0.1665 moles / 0.5 L = 0.333 M. So the concentration of HClO is 0.333 M.

Now, hypochlorous acid is a weak acid, which means it doesn't completely dissociate in water. The problem gives me the Ka value as 3.0 × 10^-4. Ka is the acid dissociation constant, so it tells me how strong the acid is. The higher the Ka, the stronger the acid, but in this case, since it's 3e-4, it's a moderately weak acid.

I remember that for weak acids, we can use the formula Ka = [H+][A-]/[HA], where HA is the undissociated acid, and A- is the conjugate base. So I can set up an ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium) to solve for [H+].

The initial concentration of HClO is 0.333 M, and the initial concentrations of H+ and ClO- are both 0. When HClO dissociates, let's say it releases x amount of H+ and ClO- ions. So at equilibrium, the concentrations would be:
[H+] = x
[ClO-] = x
[ HClO ] = 0.333 - x

Plugging these into the Ka expression:
Ka = (x)(x) / (0.333 - x) = 3.0e-4

So the equation becomes x² / (0.333 - x) = 3.0e-4

I think I can make an assumption here because if Ka is small, x will be much smaller than 0.333, so 0.333 - x ≈ 0.333. Let me try that. Then the equation simplifies to x² = 3.0e-4 * 0.333.

Calculating the right side: 3e-4 * 0.333 is approximately 1e-4 (since 3 * 0.333 is about 1). So x² ≈ 1e-4. Taking the square root of both sides gives x ≈ 0.01. So [H+] is 0.01 M.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me check that calculation more accurately. 3e-4 multiplied by 0.333 is (3 * 0.333) * 1e-4. 3 * 0.333 is 0.999, which is approximately 1. So 0.999e-4 is 9.99e-5. Taking the square root of 9.99e-5, which is about 0.00999, roughly 0.01. So [H+] is approximately 0.01 M.

Then pH is -log[H+]. So taking log(0.01) is -2, so pH is 2. But wait, let me check that. Wait, wait, wait. No, wait. 0.01 is 1e-2. The log of 1e-2 is -2, so pH is 2. So that would make the pH 2. Looking at the options, option B is 2, so that's a possible answer.

But wait, did I make any assumption that I shouldn't have? Let me re-examine. I assumed that x is much smaller than 0.333. Is that valid here? Let's see. If x is 0.01, and 0.333 is much larger, then yes, the assumption holds. So the approximation is valid.

Alternatively, maybe I should check without the approximation. Let me write the equation again: x² = 3e-4 (0.333 - x). Expanding that, x² + 3e-4 x - 3e-4 * 0.333 = 0.

Wait, wait, no. The correct expansion would be x² = 3e-4 * (0.333 - x)
So x² = 3e-4 * 0.333 - 3e-4 x
Bring all terms to one side: x² + 3e-4 x - (3e-4 * 0.333) = 0
So x² + (3e-4)x - (1e-4) ≈ 0 ?

Wait, no, 3e-4 * 0.333 is (3 * 0.333) * 1e-4 = 0.999e-4, which is about 9.99e-5, which I previously approximated as 1e-4. Hmm, perhaps I was a bit off, but the difference is negligible for the approximation.

But let's solve the quadratic equation correctly. Let me plug in the numbers.

x² + (3e-4)x - (9.99e-5) = 0

Using the quadratic formula, x = [-b ± sqrt(b² + 4ac)]/(2a)

Here, a=1, b=3e-4, c= -9.99e-5

Discriminant D = b² +4ac = (3e-4)^2 +4*1*(-9.99e-5) ?

Wait, wait, no. The equation is ax² + bx + c =0, so in this case, it's x² + (3e-4)x -9.99e-5 =0. So a=1, b=3e-4, c= -9.99e-5.

So D = (3e-4)^2 + 4 * 1 * 9.99e-5

Calculating each term:

(3e-4)^2 = 9e-8

4 * 9.99e-5 = 3.996e-4

So D = 9e-8 + 3.996e-4 ≈ 3.996e-4 + 0.0000009 ≈ ~3.9969e-4

The square root of D is sqrt(3.9969e-4) ≈ 0.01998 ≈ 0.02.

So x = [ -3e-4 ± 0.02 ] / 2.

We can ignore the negative root because concentration can't be negative, so:

x = ( -3e-4 + 0.02 ) / 2 = (0.0197)/2 ≈ 0.00985.

So x is approximately 0.00985, which is about 0.00985 M. So [H+] is 0.00985, which is 9.85e-3.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 0.01, which is 1e-2. So my approximation was slightly off, but close enough.

Now, let's calculate the pH. pH = -log[H+]

So [H+] = 0.00985 is 9.85e-3. Let me compute log(9.85e-3).

I know that log(1e-2) is 2. So log(9.85e-3) is log(9.85) + log(1e-3) → log(9.85) is about 0.994 (since log(10)=1, so 9.85 is slightly less), so approximately 0.994. Then log(9.85e-3) is 0.994 -3 = -2.006. So pH is 2.006.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, wait, no. Because pH is -log[H+], so if [H+] is 9.85e-3, then the log is log(9.85e-3) = log(9.85) + (-3) → approximately 0.9943 -3 = -2.0057. So pH is 2.0057, which is approximately 2.01.

But wait, looking back, the options don't include 2.01. Let me look at the options again.

Options are:

A:3.5; B:2; C:7.2; D:2.5e-3; E:1.2e-4; F:5.4e-3; G:3.0; H:0.5; I:1; J:1.76.

So the closest is option B: 2.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation because my exact x was 0.00985, which is 9.85e-3. So [H+] is 9.85e-3, which is 0.00985.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Because hypochlorous acid is a weak acid, the H+ concentration is determined by the dissociation:

HClO ⇌ H+ + ClO⁻

So the ICE table setup is correct. Let me recheck the Ka setup.

The initial concentration is 0.333 M. So the equilibrium expression is (x)(x)/(0.333 - x) = 3e-4.

I approximated 0.333 - x ≈ 0.333, leading to x^2 = 3e-4 * 0.333 = 9.99e-5 → x ≈ sqrt(9.99e-5) ≈ 0.009999, which is approximately 0.01.

But when I solved the quadratic equation, I got x ≈ 0.00985, which is very close to 0.01. So the [H+] is approximately 0.01 M, making pH = 2.00.

So the answer would be option B:2.

But wait, let me think again. Another way to approach this is to use the exact expression without approximation.

Wait, when I used the approximation, x was 0.01, but when I used the quadratic, x was ~0.00985, which is about 0.99% of 0.01. So the difference is minimal, and the pH comes out to be approximately 2.005, which would round to 2.01, but the option B is 2, which is close enough.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the quadratic approach.

Wait, let me redo the quadratic solution more accurately.

The equation is x² + (3e-4)x - (3e-4 * 0.333) = 0 → x² + 0.0003 x - 0.0000999 = 0.

Wait, 3e-4 is 0.0003, and 3e-4 * 0.333 is approximately 0.0000999.

So the equation is x² + 0.0003 x - 0.0000999 = 0.

Using the quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)]/(2a), but wait, no, because in the equation ax² + bx + c =0, here the equation is x² + 0.0003 x -0.0000999 =0, so a=1, b=0.0003, c= -0.0000999.

So discriminant D = b² -4ac → (0.0003)^2 - 4*(1)*(-0.0000999) → 9e-8 + 3.996e-4 → 3.9969e-4.

So sqrt(D) = sqrt(3.9969e-4) → sqrt(0.00039969) → let's compute it more accurately.

0.00039969 is 3.9969e-4.

What's the square root of that? Let's think, 0.02 squared is 0.0004, which is 4e-4. So sqrt(3.9969e-4) ≈ 0.01998, as I had before.

So x = [-0.0003 ± 0.01998]/2.

We take the positive solution: [ -0.0003 + 0.01998 ] / 2 → [0.01968]/2 = 0.00984.

So x ≈ 0.00984 M. So [H+] is 0.00984 → pH is -log(0.00984).

Let me compute that more accurately.

Log(0.00984) = log(9.84e-3) = log(9.84) + log(1e-3) → log(9.84) is approx 0.993 (since log(10)=1, log(9)=0.9542, so 9.84 is about 0.993).

So log(9.84e-3) = 0.993 -3 = -2.007.

So pH is 2.007, which is approximately 2.01.

Looking at the options, option B is 2, which is the closest to 2.01. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but I just thought of something. Wait, the actual Ka was 3.0e-4, which is exactly 0.0003. So perhaps the approximation holds, and the exact pH is around 2.01, but the options only have 2 as an option, which is B. So that's the correct choice.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider activity coefficients or other factors, but at this level, I think it's safe to go with the approximation.

So the answer is option B, pH 2.

To determine the pH of a solution prepared by dissolving 0.1665 moles of hypochlorous acid (HClO) in 500 mL of water, we start by calculating the initial concentration of HClO. Since the volume of the solution is 500 mL (0.5 L), the concentration is:

\[
\text{Concentration of HClO} = \frac{\text{moles of HClO}}{\text{volume of solution in liters}} = \frac{0.1665}{0.5} = 0.333 \, \text{M}.
\]

Hypochlorous acid is a weak acid, and its dissociation in water is governed by the acid dissociation constant \( K_a \), which is given as \( 3.0 \times 10^{-4} \). The dissociation can be represented as:

\[
\text{HClO} \leftrightharpoons \text{H}^+ + \text{ClO}^-.
\]

Using an ICE table, the equilibrium concentrations are:
- \([H^+] = x\),
- \([ClO^-] = x\),
- \([HClO] = 0.333 - x\).

The expression for \( K_a \) is:

\[
K_a = \frac{[H^+][ClO^-]}{[HClO]} = \frac{x^2}{0.333 - x}.
\]

Since \( K_a \) is small, we assume \( x \ll 0.333 \), so \( 0.333 - x \approx 0.333 \). Substituting this into the equation simplifies it to:

\[
x^2 = K_a \cdot 0.333 = (3.0 \times 10^{-4}) \cdot 0.333 = 9.99 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

Taking the square root of both sides gives:

\[
x = \sqrt{9.99 \times 10^{-5}} \approx 0.009999 \, \text{M}.
\]

Thus, \([H^+] \approx 0.01 \, \text{M}\). The pH is calculated as:

\[
\text{pH} = -\log[H^+] = -\log(0.01) = -\log(1 \times 10^{-2}) = 2.
\]

To verify, solving the quadratic equation without the approximation yields \( x \approx 0.00985 \, \text{M} \), which corresponds to a pH of approximately 2.01. However, the closest option provided is \( \text{pH} = 2 \).

Thus, the final answer is:

**B: 2**
