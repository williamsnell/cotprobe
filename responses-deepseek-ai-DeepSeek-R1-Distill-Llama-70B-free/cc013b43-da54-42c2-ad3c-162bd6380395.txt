Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the z-parameters from given y-parameters. Hmm, I remember that y-parameters are the admittance parameters, and z-parameters are the impedance parameters. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formulas to convert between them. Let me think.

So the given values are y11 = 0.25 mho, y12 = -0.05 mho, and y22 = 0.1 mho. I need to find z11, z12, z21, and z22. I think the conversion involves taking the inverse of the y-parameter matrix and then scaling it somehow. Oh right, because z and y parameters are inverses of each other when the network is reciprocal.

Wait, the general formula for converting from y to z parameters is taking the inverse of the y matrix, but I think each element is divided by the determinant of the y matrix. Or maybe the inverse matrix is multiplied by some factor. Let me get this straight.

The y parameters form a 2x2 matrix. The z parameters are the inverse of this matrix, but each element is divided by the determinant. Oh wait, no, I think the inverse of the matrix gives the z parameters, but scaled by the determinant.

Actually, the z-parameters can be found using the formula:

z11 = (y22) / (y11*y22 - y12*y21)
z12 = (y12) / (y11*y22 - y12*y21)
Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Oh, no, wait. The inverse of the y matrix gives the z matrix. So the inverse would have elements like (1/determinant) times the matrix of cofactors.

So the y matrix is:
[ y11   y12 ]
[ y21   y22 ]

Wait, but in this case, y12 is -0.05, and y21 is probably the same as y12 if the network is reciprocal, but the problem doesn't specify. Oh wait, but in passive networks, the y parameters are symmetric, so y12 = y21. So I think in this problem, y21 is also -0.05 mho.

Wait, but in the given problem, y_11 = 0.25, y_12 = -0.05, and y_22 = 0.1. So I'm assuming that y_21 is also -0.05. Because in a reciprocal network, which is typically the case unless stated otherwise, y12 equals y21.

So the y matrix is:
[0.25   -0.05]
[-0.05   0.1 ]

Now, to find the z parameters, I need to take the inverse of this matrix. The inverse of a 2x2 matrix [a b; c d] is (1/det) * [d  -b; -c a], where det is ad - bc.

Calculating the determinant first. det = (0.25)(0.1) - (-0.05)(-0.05)

Wait, that's 0.025 - (0.0025) = 0.0225.

So the inverse matrix would be (1/0.0225) multiplied by:

[0.1    0.05;
0.05   0.25 ]

Wait, let me double-check. The inverse is (1/det) times [d -b; -c a]. So for our matrix, a=0.25, b=-0.05, c=-0.05, d=0.1.

So the inverse is (1/0.0225) times:

[0.1    0.05;
0.05   0.25 ]

Wait, because -b is 0.05 and -c is 0.05.

So each element of the z matrix is:

z11 = (0.1) / 0.0225
z12 = (0.05) / 0.0225
z21 = (0.05) / 0.0225
z22 = (0.25) / 0.0225

Let me compute these values.

0.1 / 0.0225 = 4.444... Oh wait, 0.1 divided by 0.0225. Let me compute that. 0.0225 is 225e-4, so 0.1 is 100e-3, 100e-3 / 225e-4 = (100/225)* (1e-3/1e-4) )= (4/9)*10 = 40/9 ≈ 4.4444 Ohms.

Similarly, 0.05 / 0.0225 = 0.05 ÷ 0.0225. Let's see, 0.05 is 5e-2, 0.0225 is 2.25e-2. So 5 / 2.25 = (5 * 4) / 9 = 20/9 ≈ 2.222 Ohms.

And 0.25 / 0.0225 is 0.25 ÷ 0.0225. 0.25 is a quarter, 0.0225 is 2.25 hundredths. Let me compute: 0.25 / 0.0225 = (25e-2) / (2.25e-2) )= 25/2.25 = (100/9) ≈ 11.1111 Ohms.

So putting it all together:

z11 = 4.444... ≈4.44 Ω
z12 = z21 = 2.222... ≈2.22 Ω
z22 = 11.111... ≈11.1 Ω

Now looking at the options. Let's go through them.

Option A: z11=11.1, z12=4.44, z22=22.2. No, that's not matching. Because z11 should be 4.44, z22 11.1.

Option B: z11=11.1, z12=2.22, z22=4.44. No, again wrong.

Option C: z11=2.22, z12=4.44, z22=11.1. No, z11 would be 4.44, not 2.22.

Option D: z11=4.44, z12=1.11. No, our z12 is 2.22.

Option E: z11=4.44, z12=2.22, z22=22.2. Hmm, z22 is 11.1, not 22.2. So no.

Option F: z11=4.44, z12=2.22, z22=11.1. Yes! That matches our calculations. So option F.

Wait, let me check the other options to be sure.

Option G: z11=8.88, no.

Option H: z11=22.2, no.

Option I: z11=5.55, no.

Option J: z11=22.2, no.

So the correct answer should be option F.

To find the z-parameters from the given y-parameters, we start with the y-parameter matrix:

\[
Y = \begin{bmatrix} 
y_{11} & y_{12} \\ 
y_{21} & y_{22} 
\end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix} 
0.25 & -0.05 \\ 
-0.05 & 0.1 
\end{bmatrix} \, \text{mho}.
\]

The z-parameters are obtained by taking the inverse of the y-parameter matrix, scaled by the determinant of the matrix. The determinant is calculated as:

\[
\text{det} = y_{11}y_{22} - y_{12}y_{21} = (0.25)(0.1) - (-0.05)(-0.05) = 0.025 - 0.0025 = 0.0225.
\]

The inverse of the y-parameter matrix is:

\[
Z = \frac{1}{\text{det}} \begin{bmatrix} 
y_{22} & -y_{12} \\ 
-y_{21} & y_{11} 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
Z = \frac{1}{0.0225} \begin{bmatrix} 
0.1 & 0.05 \\ 
0.05 & 0.25 
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

Each element of the z-parameter matrix is then:

\[
z_{11} = \frac{0.1}{0.0225} \approx 4.44 \, \Omega, \quad 
z_{12} = \frac{0.05}{0.0225} \approx 2.22 \, \Omega, \quad 
z_{21} = \frac{0.05}{0.0225} \approx 2.22 \, \Omega, \quad 
z_{22} = \frac{0.25}{0.0225} \approx 11.1 \, \Omega.
\]

Thus, the z-parameters are:

\[
z_{11} = 4.44 \, \Omega, \quad z_{12} = z_{21} = 2.22 \, \Omega, \quad z_{22} = 11.1 \, \Omega.
\]

Comparing these values with the options provided, the correct match is:

**Option F: \( z_{11} = 4.44 \, \Omega, z_{12} = z_{21} = 2.22 \, \Omega, z_{22} = 11.1 \, \Omega \).**

F
