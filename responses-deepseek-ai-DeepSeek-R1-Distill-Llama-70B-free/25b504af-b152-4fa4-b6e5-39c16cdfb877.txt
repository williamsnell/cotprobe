Okay, so I have this quantum mechanics problem about a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator. The question gives me the wave function for the lowest energy state, which is psi = A e^(-B x²). I need to find the total energy E by substituting this into the Schrödinger equation. Hmm, right, the Schrödinger equation is the key here.

Wait, I remember the time-independent Schrödinger equation for a harmonic oscillator. It's something like (-ħ²/(2μ)) d²ψ/dx² + (1/2) K x² ψ = E ψ, where μ is the mass and K is the spring constant. Oh wait, the given potential U is (1/2) K x², so that matches.

The wave function is given as psi = A e^(-B x²). I think A is the normalization constant, which doesn't affect the energy, so maybe I can ignore it for now. The important part is the exponential term.

I need to plug this psi into the Schrödinger equation and solve for E. So first, I should compute the second derivative of psi with respect to x. Let's see:

psi = A e^{-B x²}
The first derivative, dψ/dx = A * (-2 B x) e^{-B x²} = -2 A B x e^{-B x²}
The second derivative, d²ψ/dx² = derivative of the first derivative. So the derivative of (-2 A B x e^{-B x²}) would be:

-2 A B [ e^{-B x²} + x * (-2 B x) e^{-B x²} ] 
Wait, no, that's not right. Let me compute it correctly.

Derivative of (-2 A B x e^{-B x²}) is:

-2 A B [ e^{-B x²} + x * (-2 B x) e^{-B x²} } ]
Wait, no, let me break it down. Using product rule: derivative of x is 1, and derivative of e^{-B x²} is -2 B x e^{-B x²}.

So derivative is (-2 A B) [ (1) e^{-B x²} + x * (-2 B x) e^{-B x²} } ]
Wait, that gives:

-2 A B e^{-B x²} + (4 A B² x²) e^{-B x²}
So, d²ψ/dx² = (4 A B² x² - 2 A B) e^{-B x²}

But wait, I'm not sure about the signs. Let me double-check:

First derivative: dψ/dx = A * d/dx [e^{-B x²}] = A * (-2 B x) e^{-B x²} = -2 A B x e^{-B x²}
Second derivative: d²ψ/dx² = d/dx [ -2 A B x e^{-B x²} ]
= -2 A B [ e^{-B x²} + x * d/dx (e^{-B x²}) ]
= -2 A B [ e^{-B x²} + x (-2 B x e^{-B x²}) ) ]
= -2 A B e^{-B x²} + 4 A B² x² e^{-B x²}
So, d²ψ/dx² = (4 B² x² - 2 B ) A e^{-B x²}

Now, plug this into the Schrödinger equation:

- (ħ²/(2μ)) [ (4 B² x² - 2 B ) A e^{-B x²} ] + (1/2) K x² (A e^{-B x²}) = E (A e^{-B x²})

I can factor out A e^{-B x²} from all terms:

A e^{-B x²} [ - (ħ²/(2μ)) (4 B² x² - 2 B ) + (1/2) K x² ] = E A e^{-B x²}

Divide both sides by A e^{-B x²} (assuming it's not zero, which it isn't except at infinity):

- (ħ²/(2μ)) (4 B² x² - 2 B ) + (1/2) K x² = E

Hmm, but this equation must hold for all x, which implies that the coefficients of x² and the constants must match on both sides. Because E is a constant, the left side must be independent of x, which can only happen if the coefficients of x² cancel appropriately.

So let's collect terms. Let's expand the left-hand side:

- (ħ²/(2μ)) * 4 B² x² + (ħ²/(2μ)) * 2 B + (1/2) K x² = E

Group terms with x² and constants:

[ - (4 ħ² B²)/(2μ) + (K/2) ] x² + [ (2 ħ² B)/(2μ) ] = E

Simplify each term:

The x² term coefficient: (-2 ħ² B² / μ + K/2 ) x²
The constant term: ( ħ² B ) / μ )

For this to be equal to E for all x, the coefficient of x² must be zero, and the constant term must equal E.

So set the x² coefficient to zero:

- (2 ħ² B² ) / μ + K/2 = 0
=> (2 ħ² B² ) / μ = K/2
Multiply both sides by μ/(2 ħ²):
B^2 = ( K μ ) / (4 ħ² )
Take square root:
B = sqrt( K μ ) / (2 ħ )

Wait, but the question tells me that B is given as sqrt( μ K )/( 2 something ). Wait, the question says B = sqrt( μ K ) / 2ℏ, because in the problem statement, B is defined as (μ K )^{1/2}/(2ħ), I think. Let me check: the user wrote B = (\mu K)^1/2 /2\cyrchar\cyrtshe. Wait, the last part is likely ħ (since \cyrchar\cyrtshe is the Cyrillic letter for 'sh' which is the symbol for ħ).

So B = sqrt(μ K) / (2ħ). Yes, that's what I have here.

So, now the constant term is (ħ² B ) / μ.

Substituting B = sqrt(μ K)/(2 ħ) into this:

(ħ² * sqrt(μ K)/(2 ħ) ) / μ ) =

Simplify step by step:

ħ² / (2 ħ) ) = ħ/2.

sqrt(μ K) is (μ K)^{1/2}.

So numerator: ħ/2 * (μ K)^{1/2}

Denominator: μ

So overall:

( ħ (μ K)^{1/2} ) / (2 μ )

Simplify:

( ħ (sqrt(μ) sqrt(K)) ) / (2 μ )

The sqrt(μ) is μ^{1/2}, so denominator is μ = μ^{1}.

So sqrt(μ) / μ is μ^{-1/2}.

Thus, [ ħ sqrt(K) ] / (2 μ^{1/2} )

Which can be written as:

( ħ / (2 sqrt(μ) )) ) * sqrt(K) ) 

But sqrt(K)/sqrt(μ) is sqrt( K / μ ), so:

( ħ / 2 ) * sqrt( K / μ )

Wait, but wait. Let me think about another approach. The angular frequency ω of a harmonic oscillator is sqrt( K / μ ), so ω = sqrt(K/μ). So sqrt(K/μ) is ω.

So the expression becomes ( ħ ω ) / 2.

But wait, ħ ω is the same as h-bar times omega. So E is ( ħ ω ) / 2.

Wait, but what's ħ in terms of h? Oh, ħ = h/(2π). So E = (h/(2π)) * ω / 2 = (h ω) / (4 π ), but that's not matching any of the options directly. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me recalculate.

Wait, the constant term after substitution is:

( (ħ^2) * B ) / μ

But B is sqrt(μ K)/(2 ħ), so substituting:

( ħ^2 * (sqrt(μ K) / (2 ħ)) ) / μ

Simplify numerator:

ħ^2 * sqrt(μ K) / (2 ħ) ) = ( ħ * sqrt(μ K) ) / 2

Divide by μ:

( ħ * sqrt(μ K) ) / (2 μ ) ) 

sqrt(μ K) is sqrt(μ) * sqrt(K), so:

( ħ * sqrt(μ) * sqrt(K) ) ) / (2 μ )

Simplify sqrt(μ)/μ as 1/sqrt(μ):

= ( ħ sqrt(K) ) / ( 2 sqrt(μ) )

Which is ( ħ / (2 sqrt(μ) )) ) * sqrt(K)

= ( ħ / 2 ) * sqrt( K / μ )

But sqrt( K / μ ) is ω, so E = ( ħ ω ) / 2.

Wait, but E is (1/2) ħ ω, and ħ is h/(2π). So E = (1/2) (h/(2π)) ω = h ω / (4 π )

Hmm, but looking at the options, option J is (h/2) sqrt( K / μ ), which would be (h/2) ω. Wait, but no, because ω is sqrt(K/μ), so sqrt(K/μ) is ω, so J is (h/2) ω, which would be (h ω)/2.

Wait, but according to my calculation, E is (ħ ω)/2, which is (h/(2π)) ω / 2? No wait, wait E = (ħ ω)/2. So E = (h/(2π)) * ω / 2? No, wait, E = (ħ ω)/2. So that's (h/(2π)) * ω ) / 2.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in substitution. Let me re-express E in terms of h.

E = (ħ ω) / 2 = (h/(2π)) * ω / 2? Wait no, ħ is h/(2π), so (ħ ω)/2 = (h ω)/(4 π).

But looking at the options, none of them directly have 4π in the denominator. So perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, let's go back. Maybe the Schrodinger equation I used was incorrect. Oh wait, I think I might have forgotten to include the potential correctly. No, the potential is (1/2) K x^2. So the equation is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the signs. Let me check:

Schrodinger equation is:

(-ħ²/(2μ)) d²ψ/dx² + (1/2) K x² ψ = E ψ.

When I plugged in:

- (ħ²/(2μ)) [ (4 B² x² - 2 B ) ] + (1/2) K x² = E

Which simplifies to:

[ - (2 ħ² B² / μ ) x² + ( ħ² B / μ ) ] + (1/2) K x² = E.

Then combining the x² terms:

[ (-2 ħ² B² / μ + K/2 ) x² ] + ( ħ² B / μ ) = E.

So the x² term's coefficient must be zero, so:

-2 ħ² B² / μ + K/2 = 0 → 2 ħ² B² = (K μ ) / 2 → B² = K μ / (4 ħ² )

Which gives B = sqrt( K μ ) / (2 ħ )

So then the constant term is ħ² B / μ.

Substituting B:

ħ² * sqrt(K μ) / (2 ħ ) ) / μ → ( ħ * sqrt(K μ) ) / (2 μ ) → ( ħ sqrt(K) ) / ( 2 sqrt(μ) )

Which is ( ħ / 2 ) * sqrt( K / μ )

Wait, but sqrt(K/μ) is ω, and ħ ω is the energy quantum in quantum mechanics. So E = ( ħ ω ) / 2.

Wait, but ħ is h/(2π), so E = ( h/(2π) * ω ) / 2 → E = h ω / (4 π )

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options given. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option J is E = (h/2) sqrt( K / μ )

Which would be (h/2) * ω, since ω = sqrt(K/μ).

But according to my calculation, E = (ħ ω)/2 = (h ω)/(4 π )

Wait, unless I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the substitution. Let me recheck the substitution of B into the constant term.

From earlier:

E equals (ħ² B) / μ.

B is sqrt(μ K) / (2 ħ )

So substituting:

E = (ħ² * sqrt(μ K) ) / ( 2 ħ * μ )

Simplify numerator: ħ² * sqrt(μ K) = ħ² (μ K )^{1/2}

Denominator: 2 ħ μ

So E = [ ħ² (μ K )^{1/2} ] / ( 2 ħ μ )

Simplify:

= [ ħ (μ K )^{1/2} ] / ( 2 μ )

= [ ħ sqrt(μ) sqrt(K) ] / ( 2 μ )

sqrt(μ) is μ^{1/2}, so denominator μ is μ^{1}.

So [ ħ sqrt(K) ] / ( 2 μ^{1/2} )

Which can be written as ( ħ / (2 sqrt(μ) )) ) * sqrt(K )

Which is ( ħ sqrt(K) ) / ( 2 sqrt(μ) )

But sqrt(K/μ) is sqrt(K)/sqrt(μ), so E = ( ħ / 2 ) * sqrt( K/μ )

Which is ( ħ / 2 ) * ω, since ω is sqrt(K/μ).

So E = ( ħ ω ) / 2.

Now, since ħ = h/(2π), substituting:

E = ( h/(2π) ) * ω / 2 → E = h ω / (4 π )

Hmm, but that doesn't match any of the options. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign when plugging into the Schrödinger equation.

Wait, the second derivative calculation: Let me recheck. The second derivative was (4 B² x² - 2 B ) A e^{-Bx²}.

But when I plugged it into the Schrödinger equation, it's:

- (ħ²/(2μ)) (4 B² x² - 2 B ) + (1/2) K x² = E

Wait, perhaps I missed a negative sign. Let me recompute:

The term is - (ħ²/(2μ)) times (4 B² x² - 2 B ), so:

- (ħ²/(2μ)) * 4 B² x² + (ħ²/(2μ)) * 2 B.

So the equation becomes:

- (2 ħ² B² x² )/ μ + ( ħ² B ) / μ + (1/2) K x² = E.

Yes, that's correct.

So grouping terms:

[ - (2 ħ² B² / μ ) + (K/2) ] x² + ( ħ² B / μ ) = E.

Now, for this to hold for all x, the coefficient of x² must be zero.

So:

-2 ħ² B² / μ + K/2 = 0 → 2 ħ² B² = (K μ ) / 2 → B² = ( K μ ) / (4 ħ² )

So B = sqrt( K μ ) / ( 2 ħ )

Now, substituting B into the constant term:

ħ² B / μ = ħ² ( sqrt(K μ) / (2 ħ )) ) / μ.

Simplify numerator: ħ² * sqrt(K μ) = ħ² (K μ )^{1/2}

Denominator: 2 ħ μ.

So:

E = ( ħ² (K μ )^{1/2} ) / ( 2 ħ μ )

Simplify:

= ( ħ (K μ )^{1/2} ) / ( 2 μ )

= ( ħ sqrt(K) sqrt(μ) ) / ( 2 μ )

= ( ħ sqrt(K) ) / ( 2 sqrt(μ) )

= ( ħ / 2 ) * sqrt( K / μ )

Which is ( ħ ω ) / 2, since ω = sqrt(K/μ )

Thus, E = ( ħ ω ) / 2.

But since ħ = h/(2π), this becomes E = (h ω )/(4 π )

But looking at the options, option J is (h/2) sqrt( K/μ ), which is (h ω)/2, which is twice what I have.

Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me think again.

Ah! Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expression for B. The problem states that B is defined as sqrt(μ K ) / (2 ħ ). So B = sqrt(μ K )/(2 ħ )

So substituting B into E = ħ² B / μ:

E = ħ² * [ sqrt(μ K) / (2 ħ ) ] / μ

Simplify:

= [ ħ² * sqrt(μ K) ] / [ 2 ħ μ ]

= [ ħ sqrt(μ K) ] / [ 2 μ ]

= [ ħ sqrt( K ) sqrt(μ) ] / [ 2 μ ]

= [ ħ sqrt(K) ] / [ 2 sqrt(μ) ]

Which is ( ħ / 2 ) * sqrt( K / μ ) = ( ħ ω ) / 2.

Hmm, same as before.

Wait, but the standard formula for the ground state energy of a harmonic oscillator is E = (1/2) ħ ω,
