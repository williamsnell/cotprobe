Okay, so I have this differential equations problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem states that y1 and y2 form a fundamental set of solutions for the differential equation t² y'' - 2y' + (3 + t)y = 0. We're given that the Wronskian of y1 and y2 evaluated at t=2 is 3, and we need to find the Wronskian at t=4.

Hmm, I remember that the Wronskian is related to the solutions of a differential equation. For a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation, if y1 and y2 are solutions, their Wronskian W(y1,y2)(t) is related to the coefficients of the equation.

Wait, the general form of a second-order linear ODE is y'' + p(t) y' + q(t) y = 0. But in our problem, the equation is t² y'' - 2y' + (3 + t)y = 0. Let me rewrite it in the standard form.

Dividing each term by t² gives: y'' - (2/t²) y' + [(3 + t)/t²] y = 0.

So in this case, p(t) is -2/t², right? Because the standard form is y'' + p(t) y' + q(t) y = 0. So p(t) = -2/t².

I recall that the Wronskian of two solutions y1 and y2 of a second-order linear ODE satisfies W(y1,y2)(t) = W0 * exp(-∫ p(t) dt), where W0 is a constant.

So the formula is W(t) = W(t0) * exp( - ∫ from t0 to t of p(s) ds )

In our case, p(t) is -2/t². So the integral of p(t) from t0 to t is ∫ (-2/s²) ds.

Wait, the exponential is of the negative integral. So let's compute that.

∫ p(s) ds = ∫ (-2/s²) ds = ∫ (-2) s^(-2) ds = (-2) * (s^(-1)/(-1)) ) + C = 2/s + C.

So then, - ∫ p(s) ds from t0 to t is - [2/t - 2/t0 ] = -2/t + 2/t0.

Wait, no, wait. Let me make sure. The integral from t0 to t is [p(s) ds] from t0 to t. So if p(s) is -2/s², then the integral is [2/s] evaluated from t0 to t, which is 2/t - 2/t0.

Wait, wait, let me compute it carefully. The integral of (-2/s²) ds is 2/s + C. So the definite integral from t0 to t is [2/t - 2/t0].

So then, the exponential factor is exp( - (2/t - 2/t0) ) ?

Wait, no. Because the integral of p(s) is 2/s. So when you multiply by -1, it becomes -2/s from t0 to t.

Wait, the formula is W(t) = W(t0) * exp( - ∫_{t0}^t p(s) ds )

So in our case, ∫ p(s) ds from t0 to t is [2/t - 2/t0], because p(s) = -2/s².

So, the exponential becomes exp( - (2/t - 2/t0) ) = exp( 2/t0 - 2/t )

Which can also be written as exp( 2(1/t0 - 1/t) )

So, W(t) = W(t0) * exp( 2(1/t0 - 1/t) )

Wait, that seems correct. So if we know W at t0, then at any other t, we can compute it.

In our problem, W(y1,y2)(2) = 3. We need to find W(y1,y2)(4).

So t0 is 2, and t is 4.

So applying the formula:

W(4) = W(2) * exp( 2*(1/2 - 1/4) )

Let me calculate the exponent inside:

1/2 is 0.5, 1/4 is 0.25. So 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25.

Multiply by 2: 0.5.

So exp(0.5) is sqrt(e), which is approximately 1.6487.

Wait, because exp(0.5) is e^(1/2) ≈ 1.64872.

So W(4) = 3 * e^(0.5) ≈ 3 * 1.64872 ≈ 4.94616.

Looking at the options, option D is 4.946, which matches this.

Wait, but let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First, the standard form is y'' + p(t) y' + q(t) y = 0. So I divided the original equation by t² correctly to get y'' - (2/t²) y' + (3 + t)/t² y = 0. So p(t) is indeed -2/t².

The Wronskian formula is correct: W(t) = W(t0) exp( -∫_{t0}^t p(s) ds )

So ∫ p(s) ds is ∫ (-2/s²) ds from 2 to 4.

Wait, no, actually, the integral is from t0=2 to t=4 of p(s) ds.

So p(s) is -2/s². So integrating that gives 2/s evaluated from 2 to 4.

So [2/4] - [2/2] = 0.5 - 1 = -0.5.

Wait a minute, that gives ∫ p(s) ds from 2 to 4 is -0.5.

So - ∫ p(s) ds is 0.5.

So exp(0.5) is correct.

Wait, that's a good point, perhaps I should compute the integral again.

Wait, when I compute ∫ p(s) ds from 2 to 4:

p(s) = -2/s².

Integral of p(s) is 2/s + C.

So evaluating from 2 to 4:

[2/4] - [2/2] = 0.5 - 1 = -0.5.

So ∫ p(s) ds from 2 to 4 is -0.5.

Then, the exponential term is exp( - (-0.5) ) = exp(0.5), which is the same as before.

So W(4) = 3 * e^(0.5) ≈ 3 * 1.64872 ≈ 4.946.

Looking back, I think that's correct. So the answer should be option D, which is 4.946.

To solve the problem, we start with the given differential equation:

\[
t^2 y'' - 2y' + (3 + t)y = 0
\]

Rewriting it in standard form:

\[
y'' + p(t) y' + q(t) y = 0
\]

we divide through by \( t^2 \), yielding:

\[
y'' - \frac{2}{t^2} y' + \frac{3 + t}{t^2} y = 0
\]

Here, \( p(t) = -\frac{2}{t^2} \). The Wronskian \( W(y_1, y_2)(t) \) of two solutions \( y_1 \) and \( y_2 \) satisfies:

\[
W(y_1, y_2)(t) = W(y_1, y_2)(t_0) \exp\left(-\int_{t_0}^t p(s) \, ds\right)
\]

Substituting \( p(t) = -\frac{2}{t^2} \), we compute the integral:

\[
\int_{t_0}^t p(s) \, ds = \int_{t_0}^t -\frac{2}{s^2} \, ds = 2 \left[\frac{1}{t_0} - \frac{1}{t}\right]
\]

Thus, the Wronskian becomes:

\[
W(y_1, y_2)(t) = W(y_1, y_2)(t_0) \exp\left(2 \left[\frac{1}{t_0} - \frac{1}{t}\right]\right)
\]

Given \( W(y_1, y_2)(2) = 3 \), we need to find \( W(y_1, y_2)(4) \). Setting \( t_0 = 2 \) and \( t = 4 \), we calculate:

\[
W(y_1, y_2)(4) = 3 \exp\left(2 \left[\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4}\right]\right)
\]

Simplify the exponent:

\[
2 \left[\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4}\right] = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

So:

\[
W(y_1, y_2)(4) = 3 \exp\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)
\]

Using \( \exp\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \approx 1.64872 \), we find:

\[
W(y_1, y_2)(4) \approx 3 \cdot 1.64872 \approx 4.946
\]

Thus, the value of \( W(y_1, y_2)(4) \) is approximately \( 4.946 \), which corresponds to option **D**.
