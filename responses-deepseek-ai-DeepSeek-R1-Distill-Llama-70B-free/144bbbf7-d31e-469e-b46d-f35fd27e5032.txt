Okay, so I've got this question here about a practitioner being engaged to express an opinion on management's assertion regarding the square footage of a warehouse. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think through it carefully.

Alright, let's break it down. The question is about where to find professional guidance for this situation. The options are various standards, like personal financial planning, accounting and review services, etc.

First, I remember that in auditing, there are different types of services—like audits, reviews, and attestations. The key here is that the practitioner is expressing an opinion on management's assertion. So, this sounds like an attestation engagement because they're attesting to the accuracy of a specific piece of information.

Wait, but what's an attestation engagement exactly? From what I've studied, attestation services involve a practitioner providing assurance on whether a subject matter is presented fairly and in accordance with the applicable criteria. So, if management claims the warehouse is 150k sq ft, the practitioner is checking that and providing an opinion.

Now, looking at the options. Option B is Statements on Standards for Accounting and Review Services (SSARS). But SSARS typically apply to financial statements, like compilations and reviews. This situation isn't about financial statements; it's about a specific measurement, so maybe not SSARS.

Option I is Business Valuation Services. That would be relevant if they were determining the value of the warehouse, not just the square footage. So probably not I.

Option J is Attestation Engagements. That fits because the practitioner is engaged to attest to the square footage, which is a specific assertion. So the standards for attestation engagements would apply here.

Wait, what about option H, which is Auditing Standards (SAS)? Well, SAS applies to audits of financial statements. This isn't a financial statement audit; it's a separate attestation. So H might not be the right choice.

What about the other options? A is personal financial planning, which doesn't seem relevant. C is financial advisory, but I think that's more about advising on transactions or financial matters, not attesting to facts. D is forensic accounting, which is more about investigating fraud or legal issues. E is IT services, which is about technology systems. F is tax services, which is about tax returns or planning. G is consulting, which is broader advice but not an opinion or assurance service.

So, putting it all together, the correct standard would be the Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements, which is option J.

The practitioner is engaged to express an opinion on management’s assertion regarding the square footage of a warehouse, which is a specific piece of information. This scenario fits the definition of an attestation engagement, as the practitioner is providing assurance on whether the subject matter (square footage) is presented fairly and in accordance with applicable criteria.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option B (SSARS)**: Applies to financial statements, such as compilations and reviews, which is not relevant here.
- **Option I (Business Valuation Services)**: Pertains to determining the value of a business or asset, not just verifying a measurement like square footage.
- **Option J (Attestation Engagements)**: Directly applicable because the engagement involves attesting to the accuracy of a specific assertion (square footage).
- **Other options**: Do not align with the nature of the engagement, as they relate to financial planning, tax, IT, forensic accounting, consulting, or financial advisory services.

Thus, the appropriate source of professional guidance is the Statements on Standards for Attestation Engagements.
