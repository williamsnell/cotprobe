Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question here about peroxisomal disorders. Hmm, I remember that peroxisomes are these organelles in cells that help break down certain substances. I think they play a role in fatty acid oxidation and maybe some amino acid metabolism too.

The question is asking which of the options is a peroxisomal disorder. Let me look at each option one by one.

Option A: Zellweger syndrome. I've heard of this before. I think it's a genetic disorder. If I recall correctly, Zellweger is related to peroxisomes because it's caused by defects in peroxisomal function. The peroxisomes might not form properly, so certain enzymes can't be activated, leading to the buildup of very long-chain fatty acids. That sounds familiar, so A could be the right answer.

Option B: Maple syrup urine disease. I remember this has something to do with amino acid metabolism. It's caused by a defect in the breakdown of branched-chain amino acids. I think it's a mitochondrial disorder, not peroxisomal. So B is probably not the answer.

Option C: Hemophilia. That's a bleeding disorder caused by a lack of clotting factors. It's related to the X chromosome and doesn't have anything to do with peroxisomes. So C is out.

Option D: Medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency. This sounds like it's related to fatty acid oxidation. Wait, medium-chain acyl-CoA is involved in mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation. So this is a mitochondrial disorder, not peroxisomal. So D isn't the answer.

Option E: Huntington's disease. That's a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expansion of a CAG repeat in the Huntingtin gene. I don't think peroxisomes are involved here. It's more about protein misfolding and neuronal damage. So E is out.

Option F: Tay-Sachs disease. This is a lysosomal storage disorder. It's caused by a deficiency of hexosaminidase A, leading to the accumulation of GM2 gangliosides. Definitely not peroxisomal. So F isn't the answer.

Option G: Acute intermittent porphyria. This is a disorder affecting heme biosynthesis. It's related to the enzyme porphobilinogen deaminase. I think porphyrias are usually mitochondrial or related to the cytosol, so G isn't the right choice.

Option H: Phenylketonuria. This is caused by a defect in phenylalanine hydroxylase, which is in the liver and related to amino acid metabolism. It's a cytosolic enzyme issue, not peroxisomal. So H is out.

Option I: Sickle cell disease. That's a hemoglobinopathy, causing red blood cells to sickle. It's due to a mutation in the hemoglobin gene. Not related to peroxisomes. So I isn't the answer.

Option J: Cystic Fibrosis. Caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, which affects chloride ion transport. It's related to ER processing and trafficking, not peroxisomes. So J is out.

Wait, going back to A: Zellweger's. I'm pretty sure that's a peroxisomal biogenesis disorder. There's also another condition called adrenoleukodystrophy which is peroxisomal, but that's not one of the options here. So the correct answer must be A.

The question asks which condition is a peroxisomal disorder. Peroxisomes are organelles involved in fatty acid oxidation and amino acid metabolism. 

- **Option A: Zellweger syndrome** is a genetic disorder caused by defects in peroxisomal function, leading to the accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids. This is a peroxisomal disorder.  
- **Option B: Maple syrup urine disease** is a mitochondrial disorder related to amino acid metabolism, not peroxisomal.  
- **Option C: Hemophilia** is a bleeding disorder unrelated to peroxisomes.  
- **Option D: Medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency** is a mitochondrial disorder involving fatty acid oxidation, not peroxisomal.  
- **Option E: Huntington's disease** is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by protein misfolding, unrelated to peroxisomes.  
- **Option F: Tay-Sachs disease** is a lysosomal storage disorder, not peroxisomal.  
- **Option G: Acute intermittent porphyria** is related to heme biosynthesis and is not peroxisomal.  
- **Option H: Phenylketonuria** involves a cytosolic enzyme defect, not peroxisomal.  
- **Option I: Sickle cell disease** is a hemoglobinopathy unrelated to peroxisomes.  
- **Option J: Cystic Fibrosis** involves chloride ion transport and is unrelated to peroxisomes.  

The correct answer is **A: Zellweger syndrome**, as it is a peroxisomal biogenesis disorder.  

Answer: A
