Alright, so I've got this question here: "If you ask for 'gai' at a Thai restaurant, what will you get?" And there are multiple-choice options from A to J. I'm a bit new to Thai cuisine, so I need to think this through carefully.

First off, I remember that in Thai, 'gai' refers to a type of protein. I've heard it used in dishes like "gai yang," which I think is grilled chicken. So, 'gai' probably means chicken. Let me double-check that. Thai language uses 'gai' for chicken, yes. So when you order something with 'gai,' you're asking for chicken.

Looking at the options, H is chicken. So the answer should be H. But wait, let me go through the other options to make sure I'm not mixing anything up. 

Option A is rice. That's 'khao' in Thai, I believe. So that's not it. Option B is vegetables, which is 'pak.' Option C is noodles, which could be 'mee' or 'phat thai' maybe. D is duck, which I think is 'pet.' E is tofu, which is 'tau hu' sometimes. F is shrimp, which is 'kung' or 'goong.' G is fish, which might be 'pla.' I is pork, which I'm not exactly sure, but maybe 'moo.' J is beef, which is 'neua.'

So confirming again, 'gai' is chicken, so the correct answer should be H.

The correct answer is H: chicken.
