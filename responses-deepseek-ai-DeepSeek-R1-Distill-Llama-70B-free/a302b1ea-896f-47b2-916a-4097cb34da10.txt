Question:

That modern Africans do not possess any Neandertal DNA indicates that:

Options:

A: Gene flow between Neandertals and anatomically modern humans must have occurred before Neandertals migrated out of Africa.
B: Gene flow between Neandertals and anatomically modern humans occurred after anatomically modern humans migrated out of Africa.
C: Neandertals who lived in Africa did not interbreed with anatomically modern humans, but must have followed them when they migrated out of Africa.
D: Interbreeding between anatomically modern humans and Neandertals never occurred.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Neandertal DNA in modern Africans. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking what the absence of Neandertal DNA in modern Africans indicates. The options are A through D. Let me start by recalling what I know about Neandertals and human migration.

From what I remember, Neandertals are an extinct species that interbred with anatomically modern humans (AMH) when they encountered each other in certain parts of the world. I think studies have shown that many present-day humans retain some Neandertal DNA in their genomes. For example, Europeans and Asians have about 2-3% Neandertal DNA on average.

Wait, but if modern Africans don't have Neandertal DNA, that must mean something about where the interbreeding happened. So, I think AMH originated in Africa, right? So when did they leave Africa? I believe there was a migration out of Africa, often referred to as the "Out of Africa" theory, which happened around 60,000-70,000 years ago.

So, if Neandertals were already in Europe and Asia when AMH migrated out, then the interbreeding must have happened after AMH left Africa. Because if it happened before, then the AMH who stayed in Africa would also have some Neandertal DNA. But the question says modern Africans don't have any, which implies that the gene flow occurred after the migration.

Let me look at the options. Option A says gene flow occurred before Neandertals migrated out of Africa. Wait, but I thought Neandertals were in Europe, not Africa. Did Neandertals ever live in Africa? Or were they primarily in Eurasia? Oh right, Neandertals are mostly associated with Europe and Asia. So if AMH were in Africa and Neandertals elsewhere, the gene flow must have happened when AMH left Africa and encountered Neandertals in Eurasia.

So option B says gene flow occurred after AMH migrated out of Africa. That makes sense because that's when they would have met the Neandertals. Option A suggests before migration, which would mean African populations would also have Neandertal DNA, which they don't. So B seems correct.

Option C suggests Neandertals in Africa didn't interbreed but followed AMH when they migrated. But I don't think there's evidence of Neandertals being in Africa. So C is probably wrong. Option D says no interbreeding happened, but we know that did occur because other populations have Neandertal DNA. So D is incorrect.

So the answer should be B.

The absence of Neandertal DNA in modern Africans suggests that gene flow between Neandertals and anatomically modern humans (AMH) occurred after AMH migrated out of Africa. This is because AMH originated in Africa, and if interbreeding had occurred before migration, African populations would also retain Neandertal DNA, which they do not. Instead, interbreeding likely happened in Eurasia, where Neandertals were present, after AMH left Africa around 60,000-70,000 years ago. This aligns with the fact that present-day Europeans and Asians have Neandertal DNA, while Africans do not.

Option A is incorrect because it implies gene flow occurred before Neandertals migrated out of Africa, which would mean African populations should also have Neandertal DNA. Option C is unlikely because there is no evidence of Neandertals living in Africa or following AMH during migration. Option D is incorrect because interbreeding did occur, as evidenced by Neandertal DNA in non-African populations. Therefore, the correct answer is:

B: Gene flow between Neandertals and anatomically modern humans occurred after anatomically modern humans migrated out of Africa.

Answer: B
