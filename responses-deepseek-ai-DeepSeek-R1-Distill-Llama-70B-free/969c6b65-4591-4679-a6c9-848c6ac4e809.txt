Okay, so I have this problem where Mr. Simmons is choosing between buying a bond and some preferred stock. I need to figure out which investment gives a higher effective yield and by how much. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let's understand the two options.

Option 1: 6(1/4)%, $1,000 bond at 98. So, the bond has a face value of $1,000 and a coupon rate of 6.25%. It's priced at 98, which I think means $980 because bond prices are often quoted per $100, but wait, no, wait—wait, wait, bonds are usually priced as a percentage of face value. So 98 would mean 98% of $1,000, which is $980. The coupon is 6.25%, so the annual interest is 6.25% of $1,000, which is $62.50 per year.

Option 2: 10 shares of 6% preferred stock, par $100 each, bought at 101. So each share is $101. So total cost is 10 * $101 = $1,010. The preferred stock pays dividends based on the par value. So each share pays 6% of $100, which is $6 per year. So for 10 shares, that's 10 * $6 = $60 per year.

Wait, but wait: the bond is $980 and yields $62.50 a year. The preferred stock is $1,010 and yields $60 a year.

To find the effective yield, I think I need to calculate the yield for each. Yield would be the annual income divided by the investment cost. So for the bond, it's 62.50 / 980. For the preferred stock, it's 60 / 1010.

Let me compute these. 

Bond yield: 62.50 / 980. Let me calculate that. 62.5 divided by 980. Hmm, 980 is approximately 1000 minus 20. Let me compute this. 62.5 / 980:

Let me compute 62.5 / 980. Let's see, 980 goes into 62.5 how many times? Well, 980 is bigger than 62.5, so it's less than 1. Let me write it as 625 / 9800 by multiplying numerator and denominator by 10 to eliminate the decimal. Or maybe just use a calculator approach.

Wait, another approach: 980 is 98 * 10. So 62.5 / 980 = (62.5 / 98) / 10. Let me compute 62.5 divided by 98 first. 98 goes into 62.5 0.636 times... Wait, 98 * 0.636 is about 62.428, which is close to 62.5. So approximately 0.636. Then divide by 10 gives 0.0636, or 6.36%.

Wait, wait, but 98 * 0.636 is 62.428, yes. So 62.5 / 98 is approximately 0.637, so 0.0637 or 6.37% when divided by 10. Wait, no—wait, wait. Wait, 62.5 divided by 980. Let me think again. 62.5 ÷ 980. Let me compute 62.5 ÷ 980:

Let me compute 980 × 0.063 = 61.74. So 0.063 gives 61.74. The actual is 62.5. The difference is 0.76. So 0.76 / 980 = 0.0007755. So total is approximately 0.063 + 0.0007755 ≈ 0.0637755, which is 6.37755%. So approximately 6.38%.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps a better way is to compute 62.5 / 980. Let me compute 62.5 ÷ 980:

I can write 980 as 98 * 10. So 62.5 ÷ (98 * 10) = (62.5 /98) /10. 

62.5 /98 is approximately 0.637755. So divided by 10 gives 0.0637755, which is 6.37755%, so 6.38%.

Now for the preferred stock: 60 / 1010. Let me compute that. 60 ÷ 1010.

1010 is 1000 +10. 60 ÷ 1010 = 0.059405 approximately. Because 1010 × 0.0594 is 60. So 5.94%. Wait, let me double-check with exact calculation.

Compute 60 ÷ 1010. Let's see:

1010 × 0.059 = 59.59
1010 × 0.0594 = 59.59 + (0.0004 *1010) = 59.59 + 0.404 = 60. So 0.0594 is exactly 5.94%.

So the bond gives about 6.38%, the preferred stock 5.94%. So the bond has a higher yield. The difference is 6.38 - 5.94 = 0.44%. 

Wait, but let me verify the calculations again to make sure I didn't make any errors.

Bond:

Face value: $1,000.

Price: 98 → $980.

Coupon: 6.25% → $62.50 per year.

Yield: 62.5 / 980 = ?

Yes, 62.5 ÷ 980. Let me compute this precisely.

Compute 980 × 6.3% = 980 * 0.063 = 61.74. The actual is 62.5, so the difference is 0.76. So 0.76 /980 = 0.0007755. So total is 0.063 + 0.0007755 = 0.0637755 → 6.37755%, which rounds to 6.38% (to the nearest 1/10%).

Preferred stock:

10 shares at $101 each → 10 × 101 = $1,010.

Dividend per share: 6% of $100 = $6 → 10 shares = $60.

Yield: 60 / 1010 = 0.059405 → 5.9405%, which rounds to 5.9% (since 0.0594 is 5.94%, to the nearest tenth is 5.9%).

Wait, but wait—when rounding to the nearest tenth of a percent, 5.94% would round to 5.9% because the next digit is 4, which is less than 5. So bond is 6.38%, preferred is 5.9%.

So the bond yields about 6.38%, the preferred 5.9%. So the difference is 6.38 -5.9 = 0.48%. So approximately 0.5% difference. But wait, let me double-check the exact figures.

Wait, let me compute 60/1010 exactly. 60 divided by 1010. Let me do it step by step.

60 ÷ 1010 = ?

1010 goes into 60 zero times. Add a decimal point, and a zero → 600 ÷ 1010 → still 0. Let's compute 6000 ÷1010.

1010 ×5=5050. 6000-5050=950. Bring down next zero →9500.

1010 ×9=9090. 9500-9090=410. Bring down next zero →4100.

1010 ×4=4040. 4100-4040=60. So we're back to 60. So the decimal repeats.

So 60/1010 = 0.059405... So 5.9405...%, which is approximately 5.9405%.

Rounded to the nearest 1/10% (i.e., to one decimal place), 5.9405% becomes 5.9% because the next digit (4) is less than 5.

The bond's yield is 62.5/980 = 0.0637755..., which is 6.37755%. Rounded to one decimal place, it's 6.4% because the next digit is 7 (since 0.0637755 → 0.0638 when rounded to four decimal places, so 6.37755% is 6.4% when rounded to one decimal place.

Wait, wait, let me make this clear. When rounding to the nearest 0.1%, we look at the next digit after the first decimal.

Wait, 6.37755% is 6.37755... So the first decimal is 3, the second is 7. So when rounding to one decimal place, 6.37755 becomes 6.4% because the 7 is >=5.

Similarly, 5.9405% is 5.9% because the next digit is 4, which is less than 5.

So bond is 6.4%, preferred is 5.9%. The difference is 0.5%.

So the bond gives a higher yield by 0.5%.

Wait, but wait, the options are:

Option F: The bond, by 0.5% 

Option G: The bond, by 2.0%

Option J: The bond, by 1.5%

So the correct difference is 0.5%, so option F would be correct.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure. Let me re-calculate the bond's yield precisely.

Bond: $62.5 / $980.

Compute 62.5 ÷ 980.

Let me compute this as 625 ÷ 9800. Let me compute 625 ÷ 9800.

Well, 9800 × 0.063 = 617.4 (because 9800 × 0.06 is 588, 9800 ×0.003 is 29.4 → total 588+29.4=617.4).

So 0.063 gives 617.4, but our numerator is 625; so 625-617.4=7.6.

So 7.6 ÷9800 = 0.0007755. So total is 0.063 + 0.0007755 = 0.0637755 → 6.37755%, which is 6.37755%.

Rounded to one decimal place: look at the second decimal, which is 3 (6.3...), wait no, wait, 6.37755 is 6.37755%. So the first decimal is 3, second is 7. So when rounding to one decimal place, 6.37755 rounds up to 6.4%.

Similarly, 5.9405% is 5.9% when rounded to one decimal place.

So the difference is 6.4% minus 5.9% equals 0.5%.

So the bond yields 0.5% more than the preferred stock.

Looking back at the options:

Option F: The bond, by 0.5%

Yes, that's correct.
</think>

To determine which investment gives the greater effective yield, we calculate the yield for both the bond and the preferred stock.

### Bond:
- **Face value**: $1,000
- **Price**: 98 (which is 98% of $1,000 = $980)
- **Coupon rate**: 6.25% of $1,000 = $62.50 annually
- **Yield**:  
  \[
  \text{Yield} = \frac{\text{Annual Interest}}{\text{Price}} = \frac{62.50}{980} \approx 0.0637755 \, \text{or} \, 6.37755\%
  \]
  Rounded to the nearest 0.1%, this is **6.4%**.

### Preferred Stock:
- **Number of shares**: 10
- **Price per share**: $101
- **Total cost**: \( 10 \times 101 = 1,010 \)
- **Dividend per share**: 6% of $100 = $6 annually
- **Total dividends**: \( 10 \times 6 = 60 \)
- **Yield**:  
  \[
  \text{Yield} = \frac{\text{Annual Dividends}}{\text{Total Cost}} = \frac{60}{1010} \approx 0.059405 \, \text{or} \, 5.9405\%
  \]
  Rounded to the nearest 0.1%, this is **5.9%**.

### Comparison:
- The bond yields **6.4%**, and the preferred stock yields **5.9%**.
- The difference in yield is:
  \[
  6.4\% - 5.9\% = 0.5\%
  \]

Thus, the bond provides a higher effective yield by **0.5%** compared to the preferred stock.

### Correct Option:
**F: The bond, by 0.5%**

Answer: F
