Okay, so I've got this logic problem here, and I need to figure out whether the argument is valid or invalid. Hmm, let's see. The argument is presented as:

~G ⊃ H
——
/H

Wait, no, looking again, the argument is written as:

~G → H
/H

Wait, no, the user wrote it as ~G ⊃ H followed by ~H / G. Oh, right, in logical notation, ⊃ is the same as →, so it's "if not G then H". And the conclusion is G given that H is not the case. Wait, no, the conclusion is G, but the premises are ~G → H and ~H. Wait, no, looking back, the way the problem is written is that the premises are ~G → H, and the conclusion is ~H / G. Wait, that's probably a typo, maybe the conclusion is G, given that ~H is a premise? Or perhaps the argument is structured as: the first line is ~G → H, and the second line is ~H, so the conclusion is G. So the argument is:

1. ~G → H
2. ~H
∴ G

So, the argument is using modus tollens, I think. Because modus tollens is when you have (P → Q) and ~Q, so you conclude ~P. Wait, but here, the conclusion is G, which is ~P if P is G. Hmm.

Wait, let's break it down. Let's represent the argument:

Premise 1: If ~G, then H. So, ~G → H.

Premise 2: ~H (H is not the case).

Conclusion: Therefore, G.

So, in modus tollens, when you have P → Q and ~Q, you conclude ~P. So here, P is ~G, Q is H. So from ~G → H and ~H, you should conclude ~ ( ~G ), which is G. So this looks like a valid modus tollens argument.

Wait, but I'm supposed to construct a truth table to confirm this. Let me try to do that.

The variables are G and H. So four possible combinations:

1. G = T, H = T
2. G = T, H = F
3. G = F, H = T
4. G = F, H = F

Now, let's compute each premise and the conclusion.

First, compute ~G → H. The implication is only false when the antecedent is true and the consequent is false.

So:

Case 1: G=T → ~G=F. So F → H=T → T. So premise 1 is T.

Case 2: G=T → ~G=F → F → H=F → T. So premise1 is T.

Case 3: G=F → ~G=T. H=T, so T → T → T.

Case4: G=F → ~G=T. H=F, so T → F → F. So premise1 is F here.

Now, premise 2 is ~H.

So:

Case1: H=T → ~H=F.

Case2: H=F → ~H=T.

Case3: H=T → ~H=F.

Case4: H=F → ~H=T.

So the argument is:

Premise1: ~G→H is T in cases 1,2,3; F in case4.

Premise2: ~H is T in cases 2 and 4; F in 1 and 3.

Conclusion is G.

So, to check if the argument is valid, we need to see in all cases where both premises are true, whether the conclusion is true.

So check when both premise1 and premise2 are true.

Looking at the four cases:

Case1: premise1 T, premise2 F → premises don't both hold.

Case2: premise1 T, premise2 T → so in this case, conclusion is G=T. So conclusion holds.

Case3: premise1 T, premise2 F → no.

Case4: premise1 F, premise2 T → so premises don't both hold.

Wait, so the only case where both premises are true is case2: G=T, H=F.

In that case, the conclusion G is T.

So in that one case, the conclusion holds. Are there any cases where premises are true and conclusion is false? No, because the only case where premises are both true is when G is T, so conclusion holds.

Thus, the argument is valid. So the answer should be that it's valid.

Looking at the options, option I says "Valid", and option C says "Valid, with G and H being variable". Wait, but the options are labeled from A to J. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: Invalid. Counterexample when G is false and H is true.

B: Invalid. Counterexample when G is true and H is true.

C: Valid, with G and H both being variable.

D: Invalid. Counterexample when G and H are true.

E: Invalid. Counterexample when G is true and H is false.

F: Invalid. Counterexample when both G and H are false.

G: Invalid. Counterexample when G is false and H is false.

H: Invalid. Counterexample when H is true and G is false.

I: Valid.

So, I think the correct answer is I: Valid.

Wait, but wait, I thought modus tollens is valid, so the argument holds. So the answer is I.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check.

Alternative approach: using logical equivalences.

Premise1: ~G → H. Which is equivalent to G ∨ H.

Premise2: ~H.

So, from G ∨ H and ~H, we can conclude G, using disjunctive syllogism. Because if H is false, then G must be true.

So yes, the argument is valid.

Therefore, the correct answer is I: Valid.
</think>

To determine the validity of the argument, we first reconstruct it as follows:

1. **Premise 1**: \( \neg G \rightarrow H \)  
2. **Premise 2**: \( \neg H \)  
3. **Conclusion**: \( G \)

This is an instance of **modus tollens**, a valid argument form in logic. Modus tollens states that if \( P \rightarrow Q \) and \( \neg Q \), then \( \neg P \). Here, \( P \) is \( \neg G \) and \( Q \) is \( H \). From \( \neg G \rightarrow H \) and \( \neg H \), it logically follows that \( G \).

To confirm this, we construct a truth table for all possible truth values of \( G \) and \( H \):

| \( G \) | \( H \) | \( \neg G \) | \( \neg G \rightarrow H \) | \( \neg H \) | Conclusion: \( G \) |
|--------|--------|-------------|-------------------------|-------------|---------------------|
| T      | T      | F           | T                       | F           | T                   |
| T      | F      | F           | T                       | T           | T                   |
| F      | T      | T           | T                       | F           | F                   |
| F      | F      | T           | F                       | T           | F                   |

The argument is valid if, in all cases where both premises (\( \neg G \rightarrow H \) and \( \neg H \)) are true, the conclusion (\( G \)) is also true. Examining the truth table:

- **Case 1**: \( G = T, H = T \): Premise 1 is true, but Premise 2 is false.  
- **Case 2**: \( G = T, H = F \): Both premises are true, and the conclusion is true.  
- **Case 3**: \( G = F, H = T \): Premise 1 is true, but Premise 2 is false.  
- **Case 4**: \( G = F, H = F \): Premise 1 is false, but Premise 2 is true.  

The only case where both premises are true is **Case 2**, and in this case, the conclusion \( G \) is also true. Since there are no cases where both premises are true and the conclusion is false, the argument is **valid**.

Thus, the correct answer is:

I: Valid.
