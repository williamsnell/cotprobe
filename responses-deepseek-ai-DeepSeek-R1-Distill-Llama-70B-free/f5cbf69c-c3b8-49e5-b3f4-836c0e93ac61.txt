Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about freezing point depression. Hmm, I remember that when you dissolve a solute in a solvent, the freezing point of the solution decreases. The formula for freezing point depression is delta T equals Kf times molality, right? Delta T is the change in freezing point, Kf is the cryoscopic constant of the solvent, and molality is moles of solute per kilogram of solvent.

The problem gives me some data. Naphthalene normally freezes at 80.2°C. When 1 mole of solute is dissolved in 1000 g (which is 1 kg) of naphthalene, the freezing point drops to 73.2°C. So the change in freezing point, delta T, is 80.2 - 73.2 = 7.0°C. 

Using the formula, delta T = Kf * m. Here, m is 1 mole per kg, so 7.0 = Kf * 1. That means the Kf for naphthalene is 7.0°C·kg/mol. I should note that down.

Next, the problem gives another scenario: when 6.0 g of sulfur is dissolved in 250 g of naphthalene, the freezing point is 79.5°C. So delta T here is 80.2 - 79.5 = 0.7°C.

I need to find the molecular weight of sulfur. Let me think. First, I'll find the molality in this second case. Using delta T = Kf * m. So 0.7 = 7.0 * m. Solving for m gives m = 0.7 / 7.0 = 0.1 mol/kg.

Wait, but the mass of the solvent here is 250 g, which is 0.25 kg. So molality m is moles of solute divided by kg of solvent. So m = moles / 0.25 kg. We know m is 0.1, so moles = m * 0.25. Moles = 0.1 * 0.25 = 0.025 moles.

Now, the mass of sulfur used was 6.0 g. Moles is mass divided by molecular weight, so 0.025 moles = 6.0 g / MW. Solving for MW: MW = 6.0 / 0.025 = 240 g/mol.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check my steps. So delta T for the first case was 7°C, which gave Kf =7. For the second case, delta T was 0.7, so m=0.1. Mass of solvent is 250g=0.25kg, so moles=0.1 * 0.25=0.025. Mass is 6g, so MW=6/0.025=240. Yeah, that seems right.

Looking at the options, option H is 200, B is 240. So the answer should be 240 g/mol, which is option B.

To solve the problem, we use the freezing point depression formula:

\[
\Delta T = K_f \cdot m
\]

where:
- \(\Delta T\) is the change in freezing point,
- \(K_f\) is the cryoscopic constant of the solvent,
- \(m\) is the molality of the solution (moles of solute per kilogram of solvent).

### Step 1: Determine \(K_f\) for naphthalene
From the first scenario:
- Pure naphthalene freezes at \(80.2^\circ \text{C}\).
- When 1 mole of solute is dissolved in 1000 g (\(1 \, \text{kg}\)) of naphthalene, the freezing point drops to \(73.2^\circ \text{C}\).
- \(\Delta T = 80.2 - 73.2 = 7.0^\circ \text{C}\).
- Since \(m = 1 \, \text{mol/kg}\), we calculate \(K_f\) as:
  \[
  K_f = \Delta T / m = 7.0 / 1 = 7.0^\circ \text{C·kg/mol}.
  \]

### Step 2: Find the molality of the sulfur solution
From the second scenario:
- When \(6.0 \, \text{g}\) of sulfur is dissolved in \(250 \, \text{g}\) (\(0.25 \, \text{kg}\)) of naphthalene, the freezing point is \(79.5^\circ \text{C}\).
- \(\Delta T = 80.2 - 79.5 = 0.7^\circ \text{C}\).
- Using \(\Delta T = K_f \cdot m\), solve for \(m\):
  \[
  m = \Delta T / K_f = 0.7 / 7.0 = 0.1 \, \text{mol/kg}.
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate the moles of sulfur
The molality \(m\) is defined as:
\[
m = \frac{\text{moles of solute}}{\text{kilograms of solvent}}.
\]
Substitute \(m = 0.1 \, \text{mol/kg}\) and the mass of the solvent (\(0.25 \, \text{kg}\)):
\[
\text{moles of sulfur} = m \cdot \text{kg of solvent} = 0.1 \cdot 0.25 = 0.025 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 4: Determine the molecular weight of sulfur
The mass of sulfur is \(6.0 \, \text{g}\), and the number of moles is \(0.025 \, \text{mol}\). The molecular weight (\(MW\)) is given by:
\[
MW = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{moles}} = \frac{6.0}{0.025} = 240 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]

### Final Answer:
The molecular weight of sulfur is \(240 \, \text{g/mol}\), which corresponds to **option B**.
