Question:

Suppose that 54% of the graduates from your high school go on to 4-year colleges, 20% go on to 2-year colleges, 19% find employment, and the remaining 7% search for a job. If a randomly selected student is not going on to a 2-year college, what is the probability she will be going on to a 4-year college?

Options:

A: 0.700
B: 0.510
C: 0.540
D: 0.580
E: 0.630
F: 0.675
G: 0.460
H: 0.725
I: 0.560
J: 0.610

Okay, so I've got this probability question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question says that 54% of high school graduates go to 4-year colleges, 20% go to 2-year colleges, 19% find employment, and the remaining 7% are searching for a job. Now, the question is asking: if a randomly selected student is not going to a 2-year college, what's the probability she'll go to a 4-year college?

Hmm, okay, so this sounds like a conditional probability problem. I remember that conditional probability is the probability of an event given that another event has occurred. The formula for conditional probability is P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B), but in cases where A is a subset of B, it simplifies to P(A) / P(B).

Wait, so in this case, event A is going to a 4-year college, and event B is not going to a 2-year college. So I need to find the probability that a student goes to a 4-year college given that they are not going to a 2-year college.

Let me break down the percentages:

- 4-year college: 54%
- 2-year college: 20%
- Employment: 19%
- Job search: 7%

Total is 54 + 20 + 19 +7 = 100%, which checks out.

Now, the condition is that the student is not going to a 2-year college. So the sample space is reduced to all possibilities except 2-year college. So the total possible outcomes in this condition are 100% - 20% = 80%.

Within this 80%, what's the probability of the student going to a 4-year college? That's the 54% who go to 4-year colleges. So the conditional probability P(4-year | not 2-year) would be 54% divided by 80%.

Let me compute that. 54 divided by 80 is... 54/80 = 0.675. So that's 67.5%.

Wait, let me double-check. So the total not going to 2-year is 80%, and of those, 54% go to 4-year. So yes, 54/80 equals 0.675.

Looking at the options, option F is 0.675. So the answer should be F.

I think that's right. Another way to think of it: out of 100 students, 20 go to 2-year, so 80 don't. Among these 80, 54 go to 4-year. So 54/80 is indeed 0.675. Yep, that makes sense.

To solve the problem, we calculate the conditional probability of a student going to a 4-year college given that they are not going to a 2-year college. 

The given probabilities are:
- 4-year college: 54%
- 2-year college: 20%
- Employment: 19%
- Job search: 7%

The condition "not going to a 2-year college" reduces the sample space to 100% - 20% = 80%. Within this reduced sample space, the probability of going to a 4-year college is 54%. 

The conditional probability is calculated as:

\[
P(4\text{-year} \mid \text{not } 2\text{-year}) = \frac{P(4\text{-year})}{P(\text{not } 2\text{-year})} = \frac{54}{80} = 0.675
\]

Thus, the probability is 0.675, which corresponds to option F.

Answer: F
