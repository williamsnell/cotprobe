Question:

An inventor developed a prototype of an automobile. engine that she believed was going to revolutionize the automotive industry because of the engine's fuel-efficient properties. As a wedding present to the inventor's brother, the inventor wrote on a wedding card she gave to her brother:"I hereby assign to you 20 percent of the net profits realized from the production and distribution of my automobile engine within the first year of production. "The inventor then borrowed money from creditors and began to promote her automobile engine. She was contacted by a major automobile manufacturer about the possibility of using the engine in a new line of cars the manufacturer intended to release during the next calendar year. While on her way to meet with the representatives of the manufacturer, the inventor was killed in an automobile collision. The manufacturer then contracted with the executor of the inventor's estate to license the use of the automobile engine design for a 10-year period for $500,000, payable to the estate. The creditors from whom the inventor borrowed the money to promote her automobile engine have now attached the proceeds from the licensing agreement, which have so far been paid into the estate. The brother also asserts his assigned rights to a share of the proceeds. In subsequent actions by the creditors and the brother, the court will most probably hold in favor of

Options:

A: the creditors, because the agreement with the manufacturer was made after the assignment to the brother.
B: the brother, because the inventor's assignment was recorded in a written document.
C: the brother, because the assignment was given as a gift and thus cannot be contested by the creditors.
D: the creditors, because the inventor's assignment to the brother was unenforceable as a defective assignment.
E: the creditors, because the rights of creditors/lienors are superior to those of a donee beneficiary.
F: the creditors, because the inventor's assignment to the brother was not legally binding.
G: the brother, because the inventor's assignment to him was made prior to the agreement with the manufacturer.
H: the brother, because any proceeds of the assigned right received by the assignor thereafter are held in constructive trust for the assignee.
I: the brother, because the rights of an assignee are superior to a lien against the assignor subsequently obtained by legallequitable proceedings.
J: the creditors, because they provided financial support to the inventor's project.

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about assignments and creditor rights. Hmm, let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

The inventor created a prototype engine and assigned 20% of the net profits from the first year of production to her brother as a wedding gift. She wrote this in a card, so it's a written assignment. Then she borrowed money from creditors to promote the engine. Later, she was killed in an accident before she could meet with a manufacturer. After her death, the manufacturer contracted with her estate for a 10-year license for $500k.

Now, the creditors are trying to attach the proceeds from this licensing agreement, and the brother is also claiming his 20%. The question is, who will the court favor?

I remember that when someone assigns a portion of their property, like profits, it's called an assignment. Assignments can be voluntary, like a gift, or for value. Creditors have rights against the debtor's property, but there's something about when the assignment was made relative to the creditor's claim.

So the key here is understanding the order of events. The inventor assigned 20% to her brother first, before she borrowed money from the creditors. If the assignment was effective before the creditors got their interest, then the brother's rights might come first. But wait, how does that work with the creditors' attachment?

I think that when a debtor assigns property, the assignee's rights are subject to the debtor's existing creditors. But wait, no, that's not right. If the assignment is made before the creditor's claim arises, the creditor can't reach the assigned portion because it's no longer the debtor's property. But in this case, the assignment is a percentage of future profits.

Wait, but the assignment here is of profits from the first year of production. So when the inventor made the assignment, she was assigning a future interest. But she died before the profits were realized, and the manufacturer contracted with her estate for a licensing fee payable to the estate, not directly tied to the profits from production.

Hmm, so the brother was assigned 20% of the net profits from production and distribution in the first year. But the inventor didn't get to production; she died. Then the estate licensed the engine for a 10-year period, which would include more than the first year. The payment is a lump sum, $500k, which I suppose is for the 10 years, not tied to annual profits.

Wait, but the brother's assignment was specifically for the first year's profits. But since the engine wasn't produced in the first year, maybe the brother gets nothing. Or does the licensing agreement's proceeds count as part of the profits?

Alternatively, maybe the licensing fee is considered part of the proceeds from the engine's use, so maybe it's part of the profits the brother was assigned. But I'm not entirely sure about that.

In any case, focusing on the assignment and creditor rights. The creditors attached the proceeds because the inventor owed them money. But the brother had an assignment before the creditors extended credit. So the creditors' claims arose after the assignment. Generally, an assignment made before a creditor's lien is created is valid, and the creditor can't reach the assigned property because it's no longer the debtor's.

Wait, but is that always the case? I think that when a debtor makes a voluntary assignment (like a gift) to someone, the creditors can sometimes challenge it as a fraudulent conveyance if the debtor didn't receive fair value and it was made to hinder creditors. But in this case, the assignment was made as a gift before the creditors loaned the money, so it might be valid.

So, the brother's assignment would take priority over the creditors because it was made before the debt was incurred. Therefore, the brother should be able to claim his 20%, and the creditors can't attach that portion because it's already assigned.

Looking at the options:

Option H says the brother's rights are held in constructive trust because the assignment was made before the manufacturer agreement. Option G says because the assignment was made prior to the agreement with the manufacturer. Option I says assignee's rights are superior to subsequent liens.

Wait, but the manufacturer's agreement was after the inventor's death. The assignment was before the creditors' loans. The creditors attached the proceeds, which are from the licensing agreement. So the timing is: assignment to brother, then creditors give loans, then manufacturer's contract.

I think the key is that the assignment to the brother was made before the creditors' claims arose. So the brother's interest is prior. Therefore, the creditors can't take the assigned portion.

Looking at the options, H says any proceeds received are held in constructive trust for the assignee. So the estate's proceeds from the license would be held for the brother as per the assignment.

So the correct answer might be H.

Alternatively, option G says the assignment was made before the manufacturer agreement, which is true but the manufacturer's agreement was after the assignment and after the inventor's death.

Wait, but the manufacturer contracted with the estate, so the proceeds are part of the estate. The brother's assignment was of profits from production in the first year, but the estate got a licensing fee, which is a different income stream. So maybe the brother's assignment doesn't apply to the licensing fee.

Wait, that's a good point. The brother was assigned 20% of net profits from production and distribution in the first year. But the inventor died, and the estate licensed the design for 10 years, getting a flat fee. So the proceeds are from licensing, not from production profits. Therefore, the brother's assignment doesn't cover the licensing proceeds because it's a different source.

If that's the case, the brother's assignment is of profits that never materialized because production didn't happen. So the brother might not be entitled to anything from the licensing fee.

But then the creditors are attaching the licensing proceeds. Since the assignment was of future profits, which didn't occur, the brother has no claim. So the creditors can attach the proceeds.

Wait, but the question says the brother asserts his assigned rights to a share of the proceeds. So perhaps the brother is arguing that the licensing proceeds are part of the profits, or perhaps that the assignment covers any proceeds from the engine.

This is a bit unclear. If the assignment was specific to production profits, then licensing fees might not be included. But if the assignment was more broadly worded, maybe it includes any proceeds from the engine's use.

The problem states the assignment was "20 percent of the net profits realized from the production and distribution of my automobile engine within the first year of production." So it's tied to production and distribution, not licensing. So the licensing fee wouldn't count as production profits.

Therefore, the brother's assignment doesn't cover the licensing proceeds, so he can't claim a share. The creditors, having a lien on the estate's assets, can attach the proceeds.

Wait, but the creditors' claims are against the inventor's estate. The inventor borrowed money to promote the engine, which would be a debt. When she died, her estate is responsible for paying her debts. The licensing proceeds are assets of the estate, so the creditors can attach them.

So in this scenario, the brother's assignment was of a specific future profit that didn't materialize, so he gets nothing from the licensing fee. The creditors can take the proceeds because the brother's assignment doesn't cover them.

Wait, but I'm not sure. If the estate is receiving the licensing fee as income from the engine, perhaps that's considered part of the profits. But the assignment was for production and distribution, which is different from licensing.

So, perhaps the brother isn't entitled to any of the licensing proceeds. Therefore, the creditors can attach the entire amount.

Looking back at the options, option E says creditors' rights as lienors are superior to donee beneficiaries. Option H is about constructive trust, which might not apply here.

Alternatively, if the brother's assignment is valid and the proceeds are part of the assigned profits, then the brother would have a constructive trust claim. But since the proceeds are from licensing, not production, maybe not.

I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to summarize:

1. Brother's assignment: 20% of net profits from production and distribution in the first year.

2. Inventor dies before production starts; no profits from production.

3. Estate licenses the engine, gets $500k, which is a licensing fee, not production profit.

4. Brother claims a share of this $500k.

5. Creditors claim the $500k as estate assets to pay debts.

So, the brother's assignment was for production profits, which didn't happen. Therefore, he has no claim to the licensing fee. The creditors can take the $500k as it's an asset of the estate.

But wait, another angle: the assignment was made before the creditors loaned the money. So even if the proceeds are from a different source, the assignment might still be valid and the brother's rights are superior.

Alternatively, the creditors have a lien on the estate's assets, which includes the licensing proceeds. Since the brother's assignment was of future profits, and those didn't materialize, the brother's claim is invalid, and the creditors can take the proceeds.

I think the correct reasoning is that the brother's assignment was specific and didn't cover the licensing proceeds, so the creditors can attach the funds. Therefore, the answer would be in favor of the creditors.

Looking at the options, option E says creditors' rights are superior to donee beneficiaries. Option H is about constructive trust, which might not apply here because the proceeds aren't part of the assigned profits.

Wait, but another thought: if the assignment was made before the creditors' claims arose, then the brother's interest would take priority, even if the proceeds are from a different source. Because the assignment was of a portion of the estate's income, maybe the brother is entitled to 20% of any income from the engine, regardless of source.

But I'm not sure about that. The assignment was specifically for production profits. So if the estate earns money from licensing, which is a different income stream, the brother might not be entitled to that.

Alternatively, maybe the licensing fee is considered part of the proceeds from the engine's use, which could be interpreted as part of the net profits. But I'm not certain.

In any case, I think the key is that the brother's assignment was made before the creditors' interests attached, so his rights are superior. Therefore, the brother would be entitled to his share, even from the licensing proceeds if they count as profits.

But I'm getting a bit tangled here. I think the correct answer is H: the brother because any proceeds received are held in constructive trust for the assignee.

Wait, but if the proceeds are from a different source, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the assignment was a present transfer of a percentage of all future profits, making the brother entitled to 20% regardless of the source.

In that case, the proceeds from licensing would be part of the profits, and the brother's assignment would take priority over the creditors because it was made first.

So the answer would be H.

The question revolves around the priority of rights between the brother, who was assigned 20% of the net profits from the production and distribution of the inventor's engine within the first year, and the creditors, who are seeking to attach the proceeds from a licensing agreement entered into by the inventor's estate after her death. The key issue is whether the brother's assignment, made before the creditors extended credit, takes priority over the creditors' claims.

The brother's assignment was specifically for "20 percent of the net profits realized from the production and distribution of my automobile engine within the first year of production." However, the inventor died before any production or distribution occurred, and the proceeds in question are from a licensing agreement, not from production or distribution. This raises the question of whether the licensing proceeds fall within the scope of the brother's assignment.

If the licensing proceeds are interpreted as part of the "net profits" from the engine's use, the brother's assignment, made before the creditors' claims arose, would likely take priority. Assignments made before a creditor's lien is created are generally valid, and the assignee's rights are superior to subsequent creditor claims unless the assignment is challenged as fraudulent or invalid. Here, the assignment was made as a gift before the creditors provided financial support, suggesting it was valid and enforceable.

On the other hand, if the licensing proceeds are viewed as a separate income stream unrelated to production and distribution, the brother's assignment might not cover them, leaving the creditors free to attach the proceeds as part of the estate's assets. However, the assignment could be broadly interpreted to include any proceeds from the engine's use, regardless of their source.

Given the facts, the brother's assignment was made prior to the creditors' involvement, and the proceeds from the licensing agreement could reasonably be considered part of the engine's profits. Therefore, the brother's rights as an assignee would likely be held superior to the creditors' claims, and the proceeds would be held in constructive trust for the brother.

The best answer is **H**.
