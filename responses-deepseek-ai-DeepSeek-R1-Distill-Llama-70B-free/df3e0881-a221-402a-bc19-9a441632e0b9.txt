Okay, so I've got this problem here about hyperfine splitting in EPR spectroscopy, I think. Let's see. The question is about a Cu(II) metal ion with a g iso value of 2.12. It produces four lines with a separation of 500 MHz between each line. I need to find the hyperfine splitting in mT and the hyperfine coupling in wavenumbers.

Hmm, I remember that hyperfine splitting comes from the interaction between the electron spin and the nuclear spin. The separation between the lines is related to the hyperfine coupling constant. But wait, the units here are a bit tricky because we're converting between frequency, magnetic field, and wavenumbers.

First, I think I need to find the hyperfine splitting in terms of magnetic field units (mT). I remember that the relationship between frequency and magnetic field in EPR is given by the gyromagnetic ratio. Oh right, the electron gyromagnetic ratio is gamma_e, which is approximately 2.8 x 10^10 rad/(s·T). But wait, sometimes it's given in terms of MHz per mT. Let me think. Oh right, gamma_e is about 28 GHz/T, which is 28,000 MHz/T. Wait, but that's per Tesla. So to get per mT, since 1 T = 1000 mT, it would be 28 GHz/T = 28,000 MHz / 1000 mT = 28 MHz/mT. Wait, no, wait. Let me check the units again.

Wait, 1 T is 10^4 Gauss, but I'm not sure that's relevant here. Okay, gamma_e is 2.8e10 rad/(s·T). To convert frequency (in Hz) to magnetic field (in Tesla), I can use the formula B = h*f/(g_e * μ_B), but maybe there's a simpler way. Alternatively, the conversion factor I remember is that 1 mT is approximately 28 MHz for the electron's gyromagnetic ratio. So if you have a frequency in MHz, the corresponding magnetic field in mT would be frequency divided by 28.

Wait, but wait. Let me get this right. Because the gyromagnetic ratio for electrons is about 28 GHz per Tesla. So 1 GHz is 1e9 Hz. 28 GHz is 2.8e10 Hz per T. So to find how many MHz per mT, since 1 T is 1000 mT, 28 GHz/T is 28,000 MHz per T, which is 28 MHz per mT. So 1 mT corresponds to 28 MHz.

Wait no, that's the other way around. If gamma_e is 28 GHz/T, then 1 T corresponds to 28 GHz. So 1 mT is 28 GHz / 1000 = 28 MHz. So yes, 1 mT equals 28 MHz. So to convert a frequency to mT, you divide by 28 MHz/mT.

So the separation between lines here is 500 MHz. So the hyperfine splitting in mT would be 500 MHz divided by 28 MHz/mT. Let me calculate that. 500 /28 ≈ 17.857 mT. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see exactly 17.857. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 500 MHz = 32.95 mT → 500/32.95 ≈15.17 MHz/mT, which doesn't match the 28 I thought.

Option B: 40.123 mT → 500 /40.123≈12.45 MHz/mT.

Option C:16.85 mT → 500/16.85≈29.68 MHz/mT. Hmm, that's close to 28. So maybe about 17 mT? Wait, 500/28 is approximately 17.86 mT. Let me compute that exactly: 28 times 17 is 476, 28*17.8= 17*28=476, 0.8*28=22.4 → 476+22.4=498.4, which is close to 500. So 17.8 might be 17.857.

Looking through the options, option A is 32.95 mT, which would be 500/32.95 ≈15.17, which is lower than 28. Hmm, that's not matching. Option G is 35.789 → 500/35.789≈13.96. Option J is 21.234 mT → 500/21.234≈23.55 MHz/mT.

Wait a second, perhaps I'm mixing up something about the g-factor? Because the problem states g iso is 2.12. Oh right, the gyromagnetic ratio depends on the g-factor. Oh, I see! Because the actual relation involves the g-factor.

So the formula for the magnetic field is B = (h * ν) / (g * μ_B), where μ_B is the Bohr magneton. Alternatively, the relation between frequency and magnetic field is ν = (g * μ_B * B) / h.

Wait, but I think the correct relation is that the resonance condition is hν = gμ_B B. So rearranged, B = hν/(g μ_B).

Alternatively, I remember that the conversion factor from frequency to magnetic field uses the g-factor. So, the formula can be written as B (in mT) = (ν in MHz) * (h)/(g μ_B) ) * conversion factors.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the standard formula for EPR: B (in Tesla) = (ν (GHz)) / (g * 28.0). Because 1 GHz corresponds to 1 Tesla for g=2. So for other g values, you adjust.

Wait, let me get the exact formula. The resonance condition is:

hν = g μ_B B

So solving for B:

B = h ν / (g μ_B)

Now, h is Planck's constant, 6.626e-34 J·s.

μ_B is the Bohr magneton, approximately 9.274e-24 J/T.

But let's plug in the numbers.

ν is given in Hz. So 500 MHz is 5e8 Hz.

So B = (6.626e-34 J·s * 5e8 Hz) / (2.12 * 9.274e-24 J/T)

Calculate numerator: 6.626e-34 *5e8 = 3.313e-25 J·s·Hz = J since Hz is 1/s, so 3.313e-25 J.

Denominator: 2.12 * 9.274e-24 ≈ let's see, 2 *9.274 is 18.548, 0.12 *9.274≈1.112, total ≈19.66e-24 → 1.966e-23 J/T.

So B = 3.313e-25 / 1.966e-23 = (3.313 / 196.6 ) T → let's compute 3.313 /196.6.

Wait, 3.313e-25 divided by 1.966e-23 is (3.313 / 196.6) * 1e-2 → 3.313 /196.6 ≈ 0.01685 → 0.01685 * 1e-2 = 1.685e-4 T.

Convert Tesla to mT: 1e-3 T = 1 mT. So 1.685e-4 T is 0.1685 mT. Wait, that can't be right because earlier without considering g-factor I had 17.8 mT.

Wait, wait, I must have made a mistake in the units somewhere. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, let me re-calculate B.

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

ν =500 MHz = 500e6 Hz.

g =2.12

μ_B =9.274e-24 J/T.

So B = (6.626e-34 * 500e6) / (2.12 * 9.274e-24)

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 500e6 = 6.626 *500 *1e-34+6 = 3313e-28 = 3.313e-25 J·s·Hz·s^{-1} → Wait, Hz is 1/s, so 6.626e-34 *5e8 = 3.313e-25 J.

Denominator: 2.12 *9.274e-24 = approx 2.12 *9.274 = let's compute 2*9.274=18.548, 0.12*9.274=1.112, total 19.66 → 19.66e-24 J/T.

So B = 3.313e-25 / 19.66e-24 = (3.313 / 19.66) * 1e-1 → 3.313/19.66 ≈0.1685 → 0.1685 * 0.1 = 0.01685 T.

Wait, 0.01685 T is 16.85 mT. Oh! Because 1 T is 1000 mT, so 0.01685 T = 16.85 mT.

So the hyperfine splitting is approximately 16.85 mT.

Looking back at the options, option C says 16.850 mT. So that's the first part.

Now, the second part is converting 500 MHz into wavenumbers (cm^-1).

I remember that 1 cm^-1 is approximately 3e10 Hz. Because the speed of light c is 3e8 m/s, and frequency ν = c/λ. So λ in cm is 1e-2 m → c = 3e8 m/s → ν = 3e8 / (1e-2) = 3e10 Hz → 1 cm^-1 = 3e10 Hz.

Wait, actually, 1 cm^-1 corresponds to ν = c * (1 cm)^-1 = 3e8 m/s * 100 cm/m = 3e10 Hz. So yes, 1 cm^-1 = 3e10 Hz.

So to convert MHz to cm^-1, divide by 3e10 Hz/cm^-1 and then divide by 1e6 to convert MHz to Hz.

So 500 MHz = 5e8 Hz.

So in cm^-1: (5e8 Hz) / (3e10 Hz/cm^-1) ) = 5e8 /3e10 = 5/(3e2) = 5/300 = 0.016666... cm^-1.

Which is approximately 0.01667 cm^-1.

Looking back at the options, option C has 0.01667 cm^-1. So that matches.

So the correct answer would be option C: 500 MHz =16.850 mT =0.01667 cm^-1.

Wait, but wait, another thought: the hyperfine coupling constant A is often expressed in terms of the nuclear magnetic resonance frequency, but in EPR, the splitting is related to the magnetic field. So the hyperfine splitting in mT is A/g_iso, perhaps? Or is that the nuclear g-factor?

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the nuclear g-factor. Because hyperfine splitting arises from the nucleus. So the formula might involve the nuclear magneton instead of the Bohr magneton.

Oh! Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Because the hyperfine interaction is due to the nucleus, so the gyromagnetic ratio used should be that of the nucleus, not the electron.

Wait, but wait, the initial calculation I did with the electron's gyromagnetic ratio gives the magnetic field felt by the electron. But the hyperfine splitting is due to the nucleus, so the correct approach is to use the nuclear magneton and the nuclear gyromagnetic ratio.

Hmm, this complicates things. Let me think again.

The hyperfine splitting constant A is given by the formula A = (μ_nuclear / g_nuclear) * h * ν, but perhaps I'm mixing up the terms.

Wait, perhaps another approach is better. The hyperfine splitting in energy is given by A = g_e * μ_B * B, where B is the hyperfine magnetic field. Alternatively, the splitting in terms of frequency is A/h.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let's go back.

In the problem, the separation between the lines is 500 MHz. This is the hyperfine splitting in frequency terms. But we need to express this splitting in terms of magnetic field and in wavenumbers.

Wait, perhaps the initial approach was correct, because the splitting in the EPR spectrum (the separation between the lines) is determined by the magnetic interaction between the electron and the nucleus. So the formula would involve the electron's g-factor and the nuclear properties.

Wait, but the formula I used earlier gave me 16.85 mT, which is option C, and that seems correct based on the first calculation. And the second part also matches.

But wait, the nuclear magneton is smaller than the Bohr magneton. Oh, but the initial calculation used the Bohr magneton, which is correct for the electron's magnetic moment. So perhaps the first calculation is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is to use the nuclear magneton when calculating the magnetic field contribution from the nucleus.

Wait, perhaps the splitting in magnetic field terms is given by ΔB = (h * Δν) / (g * μ_B), where Δν is the frequency separation.

So yes, in this case, that formula would apply. So ΔB is the hyperfine splitting in Tesla, and then we convert to mT.

So yes, the calculation I did earlier should be correct.

So the hyperfine splitting in mT is approximately 16.85 mT, which is option C.

And the wavenumber is 0.01667 cm^-1, which also matches option C.

So the correct answer is option C.

To solve the problem, we need to convert the given hyperfine splitting separation of 500 MHz into magnetic field units (mT) and wavenumbers (cm⁻¹). The key relationships involve the gyromagnetic ratio and the speed of light.

### Conversion to Magnetic Field (mT)
The gyromagnetic ratio for electrons is approximately 28 MHz/mT. This means that 1 mT corresponds to 28 MHz. To find the magnetic field corresponding to 500 MHz, we use:

\[
B \, (\text{mT}) = \frac{\nu \, (\text{MHz})}{28 \, \text{MHz/mT}}
\]

Substituting \(\nu = 500 \, \text{MHz}\):

\[
B = \frac{500}{28} \approx 17.857 \, \text{mT}
\]

However, the problem specifies that the \(g_{\text{iso}} = 2.12\), which slightly modifies the calculation. Using the exact formula for magnetic field:

\[
B = \frac{h \nu}{g \mu_B}
\]

where \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\), \(\nu = 500 \times 10^6 \, \text{Hz}\), \(g = 2.12\), and \(\mu_B = 9.274 \times 10^{-24} \, \text{J/T}\), the calculation yields:

\[
B \approx 16.85 \, \text{mT}
\]

This matches the value in **Option C**.

### Conversion to Wavenumbers (cm⁻¹)
To convert 500 MHz to wavenumbers, we use the relationship between frequency and wavenumbers:

\[
\tilde{\nu} \, (\text{cm}^{-1}) = \frac{\nu \, (\text{Hz})}{c}
\]

where \(c = 3 \times 10^{10} \, \text{Hz·cm}^{-1}\). Substituting \(\nu = 500 \times 10^6 \, \text{Hz}\):

\[
\tilde{\nu} = \frac{500 \times 10^6}{3 \times 10^{10}} = 0.01667 \, \text{cm}^{-1}
\]

This also matches the value in **Option C**.

### Final Answer
The hyperfine splitting in magnetic field units is approximately \(16.85 \, \text{mT}\), and the hyperfine coupling in wavenumbers is approximately \(0.01667 \, \text{cm}^{-1}\). Both values correspond to **Option C**.
