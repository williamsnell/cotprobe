Okay, so I have this problem about icebergs and how much of them floats above water. Hmm, I remember something about buoyancy from my classes, but let me think through it step by step.

The question is asking what percentage of the iceberg's volume is above water. They give the densities of ice and water. Oh right, ice is less dense than water, which is why it floats. But wait, I need to calculate exactly how much.

So, the density of ice is 57.2 lb_m per cubic foot, and water is 62.4 lb_m per cubic foot. Oh wait, wait. Wait, I think I should remember the formula for buoyancy. I think it's that the fraction submerged is equal to the ratio of the density of the object to the density of the fluid.

So the formula is: fraction_submerged = density_ice / density_water.

Wait, right. Because when an object floats, the weight of the displaced water equals the weight of the object. Since density is mass per volume, and here we're dealing with lb_m (which is a unit of mass, but sometimes used as weight in engineering contexts), but I think the ratio still holds.

So let me plug in the numbers. The density of ice is 57.2 and water is 62.4. So the fraction submerged is 57.2 / 62.4.

Let me calculate that. 57.2 divided by 62.4. Hmm, let's see. 57.2 / 62.4. Maybe I can simplify the numbers. Let's see, 57.2 ÷ 62.4. Let me do the division.

Alternatively, I can write this as 572/624. Let me divide numerator and denominator by 4 to simplify. 572 ÷4 is 143, 624 ÷4 is 156. So 143/156.

Wait, can I simplify this further? 143 is 11*13, and 156 is 12*13. Oh wait, 13 is a common factor. So divide numerator and denominator by 13. 143 ÷13 is 11, 156 ÷13 is 12. So 11/12. Wait, no, that can't be right because 11/12 is about 0.9167. But wait, 57.2 /62.4 is less than 1, so 11/12 is 0.9167, but that would mean the fraction submerged is 91.67%, which would leave only a small part above water. But that doesn't sound right because I thought icebergs have a larger portion above water. Wait, no, wait. Actually, I might have it backwards. Because ice is less dense than water, the fraction submerged is the ratio of their densities. So if ice is less dense, that fraction would be less than 1, meaning less than 100% submerged. So the fraction above water would be 1 minus that fraction.

Wait wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me clarify. Let's say an iceberg is floating in water. The fraction of its volume that is submerged (underwater) is equal to the density of ice divided by the density of water. Because, as per Archimedes' principle, the buoyant force equals the weight of the displaced water. So weight_ice = weight_water_displaced.

Since weight is density times volume times gravity, and gravity cancels out, we get density_ice * V_ice = density_water * V_submerged.

So V_submerged / V_ice = density_ice / density_water.

So the fraction submerged is 57.2 / 62.4. Let me compute that.

57.2 divided by 62.4. Let me compute this. Let's see, 57.2 ÷ 62.4. Let me do this division step by step.

62.4 goes into 57.2 zero times. Let's add a decimal point and some zeros. 572 ÷624.

Wait, 624 x 0.9 is 561.6. Because 624 *0.9=561.6. Subtract that from 572: 572-561.6=10.4. Now, bring down a zero, making it 104.0.

624 goes into 104.0 about 0.166 times because 624 * 0.1 is 62.4. 0.1 *624=62.4. So 624 *0.16=99.84.

Wait, wait. Let me do it more accurately.

Compute 57.2 ÷62.4.

Let me multiply numerator and denominator by 10 to eliminate the decimals: 572 /624.

Now, let's compute 572 ÷ 624.

Wait, that's the same as 0.916666... because 624 *0.9 is 561.6, 624*0.916666 is 572.

Wait, 0.916666... is 11/12. Because 11 divided by 12 is 0.916666...

So fraction_submerged = 11/12 ≈ 0.9167, which is 91.67%. So that's the part underwater. Therefore, the part above water is 1 - 0.9167 = 0.0833, which is approximately 8.33%.

Looking at the options, option F is 8 percent, which is the closest to 8.33%. So the answer would be F.

To determine what percent of an iceberg's volume floats above the water surface, we use the principle of buoyancy. The fraction of the iceberg's volume that is submerged is equal to the ratio of the density of ice to the density of water:

\[
\text{Fraction Submerged} = \frac{\text{Density of Ice}}{\text{Density of Water}}
\]

Given:
- Density of ice = \(57.2 \, \text{lb}_m/\text{ft}^3\)
- Density of water = \(62.4 \, \text{lb}_m/\text{ft}^3\)

\[
\text{Fraction Submerged} = \frac{57.2}{62.4}
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\frac{57.2}{62.4} \approx 0.9167 \, \text{(or about 91.67% submerged)}
\]

The fraction of the iceberg that floats above the water is:

\[
\text{Fraction Above Water} = 1 - \text{Fraction Submerged} = 1 - 0.9167 = 0.0833 \, \text{(or about 8.33% above water)}
\]

Among the given options, the closest value to 8.33% is **8 percent**.
