Question:

If the Sun were suddenly replaced by a black hole of the same mass, it would have a Schwarzschild radius of 3,000 m. What effect, if any, would this change have on the orbits of the planets?

Options:

A: The planets would be thrown out of the solar system.
B: The planets would rotate more slowly.
C: The planets would immediately be sucked into the black hole.
D: The planets would move directly toward the Sun.
E: The orbits would become circular.
F: The planets would move in spiral orbits.
G: The orbits would change based on the size of the planet.
H: The orbits would become more elliptical.
I: The planets would oscillate about their former elliptical orbits.
J: The orbits would remain unchanged.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about what would happen if the Sun were replaced by a black hole of the same mass. The question gives the Schwarzschild radius as 3,000 meters, which seems really small. I remember that the Schwarzschild radius is the radius defining the event horizon of a non-rotating black hole. So that's the point of no return, right? Anything that crosses that radius can't escape, not even light.

The main point of the question is about the effect on the planets' orbits. I'm a bit rusty on my orbital mechanics, but I remember that the gravitational force depends on mass and the distance from the center of the mass. If the Sun were replaced by a black hole with the same mass, the planets are orbiting based on that mass. So from a distance, the gravitational effect should be the same as before because the mass is unchanged.

Wait, but the Sun's radius is much larger than 3,000 meters. I think the Sun's actual radius is about 700,000 kilometers, which is way bigger than 3,000 meters. So if the black hole has a radius of 3 km, it's much smaller than the Sun. But if we're talking about the planets' orbits, like Earth's orbit is about 150 million kilometers away, that's way beyond the event horizon.

So the gravitational pull on the planets would be the same as before because the mass is the same, and the planets are orbiting outside the Schwarzschild radius. Therefore, their orbital paths shouldn't change. The planets would continue orbiting as if nothing changed. So the orbits would remain unchanged.

Looking at the options, option J says the orbits would remain unchanged. That makes sense because the mass is the same, and the gravitational force at their orbital distance would be identical. The black hole's strong gravity is only significant very close to it, but the planets are far away, so they wouldn't be affected.

Other options don't seem right. Option C says they'd be sucked in immediately, but that's only if they're inside the Schwarzschild radius. Since they're not, that's not the case. Option A suggests they'd be thrown out, but without a change in mass or a sudden loss, that wouldn't happen. Option J is the correct choice here.

If the Sun were replaced by a black hole of the same mass, the planets' orbits would remain unchanged. This is because the gravitational force acting on the planets depends on the mass of the central object and the distance from it. Since the black hole has the same mass as the Sun and the planets orbit at distances far greater than the black hole's Schwarzschild radius (3,000 m), the gravitational influence remains identical. The planets would continue their orbits as if the Sun were still present.

Option J correctly reflects this reasoning, as the orbits would not be affected by the replacement. Other options, such as the planets being sucked into the black hole or thrown out of the solar system, are incorrect because the planets are far outside the Schwarzschild radius and the mass remains unchanged.

J: The orbits would remain unchanged.
