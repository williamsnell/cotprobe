Okay, so I have this economics question about minimum wage and its effect on the market for fast-food workers. Hmm, I remember that minimum wage laws set a floor on how much employers can pay their workers. But wait, how does that affect the market?

Let me think about supply and demand. Normally, in a free market without minimum wage, the equilibrium is where supply equals demand. If the government imposes a minimum wage that's higher than the equilibrium wage, what happens?

So, if the minimum wage is set above the equilibrium, employers can't pay less than that. So, the wage cost goes up for fast-food places. They might respond by reducing the number of workers they hire because it's more expensive now. So the quantity of labor demanded would decrease, right? That's the demand side.

On the supply side, a higher wage would attract more workers. More people might want to work in fast food because the pay is better. So the quantity supplied would increase.

Wait, but if the demand decreases and supply increases, that creates a situation where the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded. That's called a surplus. So there would be more workers available than employers are willing to hire at that wage. So the market would have a surplus of fast-food workers.

Looking at the options: option F says a surplus of fast-food workers. Option H is a shortage, which is the opposite, when demand exceeds supply. So in this case, it's a surplus, so F is the right choice.

I think I'm confident with that. Minimum wage above equilibrium leads to surplus.

The minimum wage set above the equilibrium wage causes employers to demand fewer workers while more workers are willing to supply their labor, leading to a surplus.
