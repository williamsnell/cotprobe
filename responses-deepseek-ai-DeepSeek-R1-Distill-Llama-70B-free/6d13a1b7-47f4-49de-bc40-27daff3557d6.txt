Okay, so I've got this problem about cooling an aluminum plate. Let me try to figure this out step by step. Hmm, the plate is 3mm thick, initially at 200°C, and it's being quenched in water at 10°C. I need to find the time it takes to reach 30°C. 

Alright, I remember something about the cooling law, maybe Newton's Law of Cooling? Oh right, Newton's Law describes how the temperature of an object changes over time when it's exposed to a surrounding temperature. But wait, there's also something about the characteristic time or maybe the Biot number. Oh wait, the Biot number helps determine if the cooling is convection or conduction dominated. Let me think about that.

The Biot number (Bi) is given by Bi = h*Lc / k, where h is the heat transfer coefficient, Lc is the characteristic length, and k is the thermal conductivity. Wait, but I don't have the thermal conductivity here. Oh wait, maybe I can get it from the given data. Alternatively, maybe I can use a formula that doesn't require it directly.

Wait, the problem gives me the density (rho), specific heat (Cp), plate dimensions, and h. Oh wait, the plate is 3mm thick, so that's the dimension in one direction. Maybe the plate's thickness is the critical dimension here. So Lc would be half the thickness if it's a plate, but wait, for a plate, the characteristic length is usually the thickness divided by 2? Or is it based on volume to surface area? Hmm. Let me think. For a plate, the characteristic length Lc is (volume)/(surface area). Let's see, for a plate of thickness t, length l, width w, the volume is l * w * t, and the surface area is 2*(l*w + l*t + w*t). But when the plate is thin, the main surface area is the two large faces. So maybe Lc is t/2. Wait, no, actually, for a plate, the characteristic length is half the thickness because it's a one-dimensional cooling case. So maybe Lc is t/2.

But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe for a plate, the characteristic length is the thickness itself. Hmm. Let me think. In some textbooks, for a flat plate (like a wall), the characteristic length is Lc = thickness. So maybe in this case, Lc is 3mm, which is 0.003 m.

Wait, but I don't have the thermal conductivity (k) of aluminum. Oh wait, maybe I can calculate it somehow? Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to use the formula for the time constant in a lumped capacitance model. Wait, but the lumped capacitance method is only valid when the Biot number is less than 0.1. So let me check if that's the case here.

So Bi = h * Lc / k.

But I don't have k. Alternatively, maybe I can find k. Let me think, I know that for aluminum, the thermal conductivity is around 180 to 200 W/m·K. Wait, let's say approximately 200 W/m·K. So k is about 200 W/m·K. But wait, the units here might matter. Oh wait, the heat transfer coefficient h is given in kcal/m²·hr·°C. Let me convert that to W/m²·K because 1 kcal is about 4186.8 joules, so 1 kcal/(m²·hr·°C) is equal to (4186.8 J)/(3600 s * m² * K) ≈ 1.163 W/m²·K. So h = 5000 kcal/m²·hr·°C would be 5000 * 1.163 ≈ 5815 W/m²·K. Hmm, that seems really high, but maybe it's correct.

Wait, that's a big number. So h is 5000 kcal/(m²·hr·°C) → 5000 * 1.163 ≈ 5815 W/m²·K. Okay, let's proceed with that.

So Lc is the thickness, 3mm = 0.003 m.

So Bi = h * Lc / k → Bi = (5815 W/m²·K) * (0.003 m) / (200 W/m·K) → 5815 * 0.003 = 17.445, divided by 200 is about 0.0872. So Bi ≈ 0.087, which is less than 0.1. So the lumped capacitance method is applicable. Great, that makes things easier.

So the lumped capacitance model says that the temperature change over time can be modeled with an exponential decay. The formula is:

(T(t) - T_surr) / (T_initial - T_surr) ) = exp( -t / τ )

Where τ is the time constant, which is (rho * V * Cp) / (h * A), but wait, more accurately, the time constant is ( (rho * Lc * Cp) ) / h ). Because for the lumped system, τ = (rho * Lc * Cp) / h.

Wait, let me get the formula right. The time constant τ is ( (rho * V * Cp) ) / (h * A ), where V is the volume and A is the surface area. But for a plate, V = A * Lc, so τ = (rho * A * Lc * Cp) / (h * A) ) → τ = (rho * Lc * Cp) / h.

Yes, that's correct. So τ = (rho * Lc * Cp) / h.

But wait, let's make sure about the units. Rho is in kg/m³, Lc in meters, Cp in kcal/kg·°C. Hmm, but the h is in W/m²·K, which is J/(s·m²·K). Let me check the units to make sure.

Wait, Cp is given in kcal/kg·°C, and I might need to convert it to J/kg·°C for consistency. Because 1 kcal = 4186.8 J, so 0.2 kcal/kg·°C is 0.2 * 4186.8 ≈ 837.36 J/kg·°C.

So Cp = 0.2 kcal/kg·°C = 837.36 J/kg·°C.

Wait, but earlier I converted h to W/m²·K, which is correct. So let's plug all the numbers.

So τ = (rho * Lc * Cp) / h.

Plugging in the numbers:

rho = 3000 kg/m³

Lc = 0.003 m

Cp = 837.36 J/kg·°C

h = 5815 W/m²·K → because 5000 kcal/(m²·hr·°C) is 5000 * 1.163 ≈ 5815 W/m²·K.

So τ = (3000 * 0.003 * 837.36) / 5815.

Let me compute numerator first.

3000 * 0.003 = 9.

9 * 837.36 = 7536.24.

So numerator is 7536.24.

Divide by 5815: 7536.24 / 5815 ≈ let's compute that.

Hmm, 5815 * 1.3 = approx 7560. So 7536 is about 1.297 times 5815. So τ ≈ 1.297 seconds.

Wait, so the time constant is about 1.3 seconds.

Now, the formula is:

(T(t) - T_surr) / (T_initial - T_surr) = exp(-t/τ)

We have T(t) = 30°C

T_initial = 200°C

T_surr = 10°C

So plug in:

(30 -10)/(200 -10) = exp(-t/1.297)

So 20/190 = exp(-t/1.297)

Simplify 20/190 → 1/9.5 ≈ 0.10526.

So ln(0.10526) = -t/1.297.

Compute ln(0.10526) → let's see, ln(1/10) is -2.3026, ln(0.10526) is approximately -2.254.

Wait, let me calculate it more accurately. Let me use calculator function.

ln(0.10526) ≈ -2.254.

So:

-2.254 = -t / 1.297 → t = 2.254 * 1.297 → Let's compute that.

2.254 * 1.3 ≈ 2.9302, but since it's 1.297, it's a bit less.

Compute 2.254 * 1.297:

2 * 1.297 = 2.594

0.254 * 1.297 → 0.25 *1.297=0.32425, 0.004*1.297=0.005188 → total 0.329438.

So 2.594 + 0.329438=2.9234 seconds.

Wait, so t ≈ 2.9234 seconds. Looking at the options, the closest one would be option G: 2.5 seconds, or option B: 2.8 seconds.

Wait, but perhaps my approximation of ln(0.10526) being -2.254 is a bit rough. Let me compute it more accurately.

Compute ln(1/9.5) exactly. Let me compute 1/9.5 = 0.1052631578947.

So ln(0.1052631578947) = let's calculate:

We know that ln(0.1) is -2.302585093.

0.10526 is slightly higher than 0.1, so the ln would be slightly higher than -2.3026.

Let me compute it using the Taylor expansion or perhaps a calculator approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a calculator function here.

Alternatively, using a calculator: ln(0.1052631578947) ≈ -2.2538.

So, let's use that. So ln(0.105263) ≈ -2.2538.

Thus, t = 2.2538 * 1.297.

Compute 2.2538 * 1.297.

Let me compute 2 * 1.297 = 2.594.

0.2538 * 1.297 = ?

0.2 * 1.297 = 0.2594.

0.05 * 1.297 = 0.06485.

0.0038 * 1.297 ≈ 0.0049266.

Add them: 0.2594 + 0.06485 = 0.32425 + 0.0049266 ≈ 0.3291766.

So total is 2.594 + 0.3291766 ≈ 2.92318 seconds.

So approximately 2.923 seconds. Looking at the options, the closest one is option B: 2.8 seconds, or perhaps between B and G (2.5). Wait, the options are:

A:4.0, B:2.8, C:6.3, D:5.5, E:3.2, F:1.45, G:2.5, H:3.6, I:0.98, J:0.75.

So 2.92 is closer to 2.8 (B) than to 2.5 (G). So the answer would be B: 2.8 seconds.

Wait, but let me double-check all the steps for any possible miscalculations.

Wait, when I calculated τ, I used Lc as 0.003 m (3mm), which I thought was correct. Let me confirm that part.

The plate is 3mm thick. For a plate, the characteristic length is the thickness (L) divided by 2, or the full thickness? Wait, I think for a plate, the characteristic length is Lc = L/2, where L is the thickness. Because the heat has to travel from the center to the surface, which is L/2. So perhaps I should use Lc = 0.003 m / 2 = 0.0015 m.

Wait wait, that's a crucial point. So if I made a mistake here, everything else is wrong.

So the Biot number calculation would then be different. Let me recalculate.

If Lc is 0.0015 m, then Bi = h * Lc / k → (5815 W/m²·K) * 0.0015 m / 200 W/m·K → 5815 * 0.0015 = 8.7225, divided by 200 → 0.0436. So Bi is 0.0436, which is still less than 0.1, so the lumped method still applies.

But then, the time constant τ would be (rho * Lc * Cp) / h.

So with Lc = 0.0015 m.

So τ = (3000 kg/m³ * 0.0015 m * 837.36 J/kg·K ) / 5815 W/m²·K.

Let me compute numerator: 3000 * 0.0015 = 4.5; 4.5 * 837.36 = ?

4 * 837.36 = 3349.44, 0.5 *837.36=418.68 → total 3349.44 +418.68 = 3768.12 J·s/m²·K? Wait, let me check the units.

Wait, rho is kg/m³, Lc is m, Cp is J/kg·K, and h is W/m²·K → W is J/s, so h is J/(s·m²·K).

So τ has units of seconds.

So numerator is 3000 * 0.0015 * 837.36 → let's compute that.

3000 * 0.0015 = 4.5.

4.5 * 837.36 = 3768.12.

So τ = 3768.12 / 5815 ≈ 0.648 seconds.

Oh wait, that's a big difference. Earlier, I had τ as around 1.3 seconds, but now it's 0.648 s.

So the formula would then be:

(T(t)-T_surr)/(T_initial-T_surr) = exp(-t/τ)

So (30-10)/(200-10) = 20/190 = 1/9.5 ≈ 0.10526 = exp(-t/0.648)

Taking natural log:

ln(0.10526) = -t/0.648 → t = -0.648 * ln(0.10526)

ln(0.10526) ≈ -2.2538 → t = 0.648 * 2.2538 ≈ 1.461 seconds.

Wait, that's around 1.46 seconds. Looking at the options, option F is 1.45 seconds. So that's very close.

Hmm, so this suggests that the correct answer is F: 1.45 seconds.

Wait, but wait a minute, why did I change the Lc from 0.003 m to 0.0015 m? Because I was second-guessing whether Lc is half the thickness or the full thickness for a plate. Let me check what the correct approach is.

In the lumped capacitance method, the characteristic length is defined as the volume-to-surface-area ratio. For a plate, the volume is A*L (where A is the area of one face, and L is the thickness). The surface area for the plate would be 2A (since both sides are exposed). So the volume is A*L, surface area is 2A, so Lc = (A*L)/(2A) ) = L/2.

Ah, that's the correct approach. So Lc is indeed half the thickness, so 0.003 m / 2 = 0.0015 m.

So my mistake earlier was using the full thickness, but the correct Lc is 0.0015 m. So the time constant τ is 0.648 seconds, leading to t ≈ 1.46 seconds, which matches option F: 1.45 seconds.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors in this second approach.

So τ = (rho * Lc * Cp) / h.

Rho is 3000 kg/m³, Lc is 0.0015 m, Cp is 837.36 J/kg·K, h is 5815 W/m²·K.

So:

3000 * 0.0015 = 4.5.

4.5 * 837.36 = 3768.12.

Divide by 5815: 3768.12 / 5815 ≈ 0.648 seconds.

So τ ≈ 0.648 s.

Then, (T(t) - T_surr)/(T_initial - T_surr) = exp(-t/τ).

So 20/190 = exp(-t/0.648).

ln(1/9.5) = ln(0.105263) ≈ -2.2538.

So t = 0.648 * 2.2538 ≈ 1.461 seconds.

Which is approximately 1.46 seconds, so the closest option is F:1.45 seconds.

So the correct answer should be F.

Wait, but earlier when I used Lc as 0.003 m, I got around 2.92 seconds, which would have matched option B. But after correcting Lc to 0.0015 m, I get 1.46 s, which is option F.

So the confusion arises from the correct value of Lc. Let me make sure.

Another way to think about Lc for a plate. Let me look up the formula. Oh wait, in my mind, the formula for Lc when using lumped capacitance is V/A, the volume to surface area ratio. So for a plate of area A and thickness L, the volume is A*L, and the surface area is 2A (assuming both sides are exposed). So V/A = (A*L)/(2A) ) = L/2. So yes, Lc is L/2. So in this case, since the plate is 3mm thick, Lc is 1.5mm or 0.0015 m.

Therefore, the time constant is 0.648 s, and the time is approximately 1.46 s, which is option F:1.45 seconds.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the Cp conversion. The given Cp is 0.2 kcal/kg·°C. 1 kcal is 4186.8 J, so 0.2 kcal is 837.36 J, correct.

So yes, all the steps
