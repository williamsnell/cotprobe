The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A resident announced his candidacy for state representative. A law in the state requires new political entrants (regardless of party affiliation) to obtain three times the number of signatures as other candidates who have run for office previously. The resident, however, failed to obtain the necessary number of authenticating signatures to have his name placed on the ballot. The resident filed a complaint in federal district court alleging the unconstitutionality of the authenticating requirement. Which of the following, if established, is the state's strongest argument for sustaining the validity of the authenticating requirement?

Options:

A: The resident's petition contained a large number of false signatures.
B: A similar authenticating statute was held to be constitutional in another state the previous year.
C: The authenticating requirement was necessary to further a compelling state interest.
D: Two other candidates had successfully petitioned to have their names included on the ballot.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about constitutional law, specifically dealing with election laws and signature requirements for candidates. Hmm, I remember studying about this in my con law class. Let me think through the issue.

The question is about a resident who wants to run for state representative but can't get enough authenticating signatures. He's suing, claiming the law is unconstitutional. The law requires new political entrants to get three times the number of signatures compared to other candidates who have run before. So, the state's defending this law, and we need to find their strongest argument.

The options are A through D. Let me go through each one.

Option A: The resident's petition had a lot of false signatures. Wait, but the issue here is about the number of required signatures, not their validity. The resident failed to get enough, but if many were false, does that affect the constitutional challenge? I don't think so. The challenge is about the requirement being too high, not about the signatures being fake. So maybe A isn't the strongest argument for the state.

Option B: A similar statute was upheld in another state. Well, that's precedent from another jurisdiction. But each state's laws can be different, and federal courts might not necessarily follow another state's decision unless it's binding. Plus, the Supreme Court could have different rulings. So B might not be the strongest, since it's not from the same jurisdiction or the Supreme Court.

Option C: The requirement is necessary to further a compelling state interest. Oh, right, strict scrutiny. When a law burdens a fundamental right, like the right to run for office, the state must show a compelling interest and that the law is narrowly tailored. So if the state can prove that this higher signature requirement serves a compelling interest, like preventing ballot clutter or ensuring candidates are serious, that would be a strong argument. This seems like a solid option.

Option D: Two other candidates successfully got on the ballot. So others managed, but does that mean the law isn't a burden? Not necessarily. The fact that others succeeded doesn't prove that the requirement isn't unconstitutional. It could just mean they had more resources or support. The issue is whether the requirement is justified, not whether some people can meet it. So D might not be the strongest.

So, the strongest argument would be that the law serves a compelling government interest. Option C sounds like the correct answer. The state needs to show that the requirement is necessary for a very important reason and that it's the least restrictive means. Without that, the law might be struck down as an undue burden on the candidate's rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.

The strongest argument for the state to sustain the validity of the authenticating requirement would be that the requirement is necessary to further a compelling state interest. Under strict scrutiny, which applies when a law burdens a fundamental right such as the right to run for office, the state must demonstrate that the law serves a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. If the state can show that the higher signature requirement for new candidates is essential to advancing a compelling interest, such as reducing ballot clutter or ensuring candidate seriousness, this would be the most robust defense. 

Other options are weaker: 

- **A** focuses on the validity of signatures, which is irrelevant to the constitutional challenge regarding the number of required signatures.  
- **B** relies on precedent from another state, which is not binding on the federal court.  
- **D** merely shows that some candidates succeeded, which does not address whether the requirement is constitutional.  

Thus, the strongest argument is **C**. 

Answer: C
