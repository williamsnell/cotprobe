Okay, so I have this math problem here that I need to solve. The question is asking me to write 4 and 4 over 5 as an improper fraction. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.

Wait, 4 and 4/5 is a mixed number, right? I remember that mixed numbers can be converted into improper fractions by multiplying the whole number part by the denominator and then adding the numerator. So, the formula is something like (whole number * denominator) + numerator, all over the denominator.

Let me break it down. The whole number here is 4, and the fraction part is 4/5. So first, I'll multiply 4 by 5. 4 times 5 is 20. Then I add the numerator, which is 4, so 20 plus 4 equals 24. So the improper fraction should be 24 over 5.

Now I need to look at the options provided. The options are labeled A through J. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A is 26/5. Hmm, that's too high because 4*5 is 20, plus 4 is 24. So 26 would be 2 more than that. Not right.

Option B is 18/5. Wait, 18 divided by 5 is 3.6, which is way less than 4. So that's not it.

Option C is 4/5. Oh, that's just the fractional part without the whole number. So that's incorrect because we need the whole thing as an improper fraction.

Option D is 32/5. That's 6 and 2/5, which is way too big. Because 4*5 is 20, plus 4 is 24, so 32 would be 8 more than needed. Not right.

Option E is 28/5. That's 5*5 is 25, plus 3 is 28. Wait, 28/5 is 5.6, but 4 and 4/5 is 4.8. So that's a bit higher than needed. So E is not correct.

Option F is 24/5. Oh, that's exactly what I calculated earlier. 24 divided by 5 is 4.8, which matches 4 and 4/5. So this must be the correct answer.

Just to make sure I'm not making a mistake, let me double-check. 4 * 5 = 20, plus 4 is 24. So the improper fraction is 24/5, which is option F.

Let me glance at the other options to be thorough. Option G is 30/5, which is 6, way too big. H is 8/5, which is 1.6, too small. I is 20/5, which is 4, but that's only the whole number part. J is 22/5, which would be 4.4, but we have 4.8, so no.

So yeah, I'm confident the correct answer is option F.

To convert the mixed number 4 and 4/5 into an improper fraction, follow these steps:

1. Multiply the whole number (4) by the denominator (5):  
   \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \).

2. Add the numerator of the fractional part (4) to the result:  
   \( 20 + 4 = 24 \).

3. Place this sum over the original denominator (5):  
   \( \frac{24}{5} \).

Now, compare this result with the given options. The correct match is **Option F: 24 over 5**.

Answer: F
