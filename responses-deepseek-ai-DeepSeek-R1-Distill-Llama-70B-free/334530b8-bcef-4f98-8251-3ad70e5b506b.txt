Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still new to this. But I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question involves the reaction 3H2(g) + N2(g) ⇌ 2NH3(g). The standard enthalpy change at 298 K is given as -22.08 kcal. But wait, the question is about calculating something else, maybe the enthalpy change at a different temperature using the heat capacity data provided. Hmm, the options are in both kcal and kJ, so perhaps the answer involves converting units as well.

I remember that when the temperature changes, the enthalpy change (ΔH) can be calculated using the heat capacities (Cp) of the reactants and products. The formula I think is ΔH = ΔH° + ∫(ΔCp) dT from T1 to T2. Oh wait, but wait: the problem gives Cp as functions of temperature for each substance. So I need to calculate ΔCp as a function of T, integrate that from 298 K to another temperature, and then add that to the standard ΔH to get the new ΔH.

Wait, but the question doesn't specify the temperature. Hmm, looking back, the problem statement says "the heat capacity data for the reaction is given", and then provides Cp for each substance. Oh, wait, perhaps the reaction is at another temperature, say T, and we need to find ΔH at that T.

Wait, but the options suggest that the answer is in specific values. Let me read the problem again. Oh wait, the problem says the question is about the reaction, and the heat capacity data is given. So perhaps the question is to calculate the enthalpy change at a different temperature, not 298 K. But the question is a bit unclear. Alternatively, maybe the problem is about calculating the standard enthalpy change using heat capacities, but that doesn't fit with the given data.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Looking at the options, they have ΔH values in both kcal and kJ. The given ΔH° at 298 is -22.08 kcal. The options have other values, like -20.38, -25.38, etc. So I think the question is to calculate the ΔH at a different temperature, say T, using the Cp data.

Wait, but the question isn't entirely clear. Alternatively, maybe the question is to calculate the standard enthalpy change using the Cp expressions, but that doesn't make sense because standard enthalpies are usually given at a specific temperature, like 298 K.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me try to figure out what's being asked. The reaction is given, along with ΔH° at 298 K. Then, Cp data is given for each substance as functions of temperature. The question must involve using this Cp data to calculate ΔH at a different temperature. But wait, the question isn't stated beyond the problem, it just shows the equation and the given data. Hmm, perhaps the question is to calculate the ΔH at a certain temperature, but the multiple-choice options don't specify, so I'm a bit confused.

Wait, maybe the question is to compute the ΔH at a different temperature, say, for example, 300 K or another value. Alternatively, perhaps the question is about converting the given ΔH from 298 K to another temperature.

I think the standard approach is to calculate ΔH at another temperature using the Cp values. So, for a reaction aA + bB → cC + dD, the ΔCp is calculated as [c*Cp(C) + d*Cp(D)] - [a*Cp(A) + b*Cp(B)], and then integrate from T1 to T2 to find the change in ΔH.

In this case, the reaction is 3H2 + N2 → 2NH3. So the ΔCp would be [2*Cp(NH3)] - [3*Cp(H2) + Cp(N2)].

Each Cp is given as a function of T:

Cp for H2(g) = 6.9469 - 0.1999e-3 T + 4.808e-7 T²
Cp for N2(g) = 6.1890 + 7.8872e-3 T -7.2801e-7 T²
Cp for NH3(g) = 6.5421 +1.25e-3 T -0.00717e-7 T²? Wait, looking back, the user wrote:

for H2(g): 6.9469 − .1999 ×10^-3 T + 4.808 ×10^-7 T²
for N2(g): 6.5421 + 1.25 ×10^-3 T − .00717 ×10^-7 T²? Wait, no, wait, wait.

Wait, the given Cp for each substance is:

H2(g): C°p = 6.9469 − 0.1999 ×10^-3 T + 4.808 ×10^-7 T²
N2(g): C°p = 6.1890 + 7.8872 ×10^-3 T - 7.2801 ×10^-7 T²
NH3(g): C°p =6.5421 + 1.25 ×10^-3 T − 0.00717 ×10^-7 T²

Wait, no, the user wrote:

"for H_2(g) C°_P = 6.9469 - .1999 × 10^-3T + 4.808 × 10^-7T^2
for N_2(g) C°_P = 6.5421 + 1.25 × 10^-3T - .00717 × 10^-7T^2
for NH_3(g) C°_P = 6.1890 + 7.8872 × 10^-3T - 7.2801 × 10^-7T^2"

Wait, no, actually, looking back, the user wrote:

Ah, wait, the user made a typo.

Wait, the user wrote:

The heat capacity data for the reaction is given in cal mol^-1 K^-1 as

C°_P = 6.9469 - .1999 × 10^-3 T + 4.808 × 10^-7 T^2 for H_2(g)

C°_P = 6.5421 + 1.25 × 10^-3 T - .00717 × 10^-7 T^2 for N_2(g)

C°_P = 6.1890 + 7.8872 × 10^-3 T - 7.2801 × 10^-7 T^2 for NH_3(g)

Wait, no, that can't be right because N2 and NH3 are different substances. Let me recheck.

Wait, the user wrote:

for H2(g): C°_P = 6.9469 − .1999 × 10^-3 T + 4.808 × 10^-7 T²

for N2(g): C°_P = 6.5421 + 1.25 × 10^-3 T − .00717 × 10^-7 T²

Wait, that can't be right because N2 is diatomic and should have a higher heat capacity than H2, which is also diatomic but lighter. Wait, but H2 has higher Cp than N2 at certain temps. Not sure, but perhaps that's correct.

Wait, but the problem is that the heat capacities are given as functions of T, so to compute ΔCp, I need to evaluate each Cp at temperature T and then compute the sum for reactants and products.

Wait, but the question is asking for the ΔH at a different temperature, perhaps.

But the problem statement is a bit unclear. Maybe the question is to compute the ΔH at a temperature other than 298 K, using the Cp data. Since the given ΔH° is at 298 K, which is 25°C.

So, perhaps the question is to compute ΔH at a different temperature, say, T, but I don't know the T. Hmm, but the options have specific values, which suggests that perhaps we're to calculate the ΔH at another temperature, maybe 300 K or another value.

Alternatively, maybe the question is to calculate the standard ΔH using Cp data, but that doesn't seem right because ΔH° is already given.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to compute the ΔH at a different temperature, say, 350 K, using the Cp expressions. But the user hasn't specified the temperature. Alternatively, perhaps the question is to find the ΔH at a temperature T when Cp is considered.

Wait, maybe the reaction's ΔH is being calculated at a different temperature, say, T, but without knowing T, I can't proceed. Hmm, perhaps the question is to find the ΔH at another specific temperature, but the user hasn't provided that.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me re-examine the problem.

Wait, the problem gives the reaction and the ΔH° at 298 K as -22.08 kcal. Then, the Cp data is provided as functions of T. So, perhaps the question is to calculate the ΔH at another temperature, say, T, using the Cp expressions, but the options don't give the temperature. Maybe the question is to compute the ΔH at a certain temperature, say, T, but without knowing T, I can't compute it.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is to compute the ΔH using the Cp expressions at a specific temperature, and the options are the possible values.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the standard approach.

The enthalpy change at temperature T can be calculated using the equation:

ΔH(T) = ΔH°(T1) + ∫(from T1 to T) ΔCp dT

Where ΔCp is the heat capacity change of the reaction, calculated as [sum Cp(products) × stoichiometric coefficients] - [sum Cp(reactants) × stoichiometric coefficients].

In this case, the reaction is 3H2 + N2 → 2NH3.

So, ΔCp = [2 Cp(NH3)] - [3 Cp(H2) + 1 Cp(N2)].

Each Cp is a function of T, so ΔCp is also a function of T. Then, the integral from T1 (298 K) to T2 (unknown) would give the change in ΔH.

Wait, but without knowing T2, how can I compute the integral? Hmm, maybe the problem is to determine the ΔH at another temperature, say T, but without knowing T, I can't proceed. Unless perhaps the problem is to calculate the ΔH at T= T, but that seems impossible without T.

Wait, perhaps the question is to compute the ΔH at a standard temperature other than 298 K, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to compute the ΔH using the average heat capacities, but that approach is an approximation.

Wait, perhaps I've misunderstood the problem. Maybe the question is to compute the standard enthalpy change using the Cp expressions, but that doesn't make sense because the standard enthalpy is already given.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to compute the ΔH at a different temperature, say, T, and the options are given, so perhaps the calculation yields a specific value among the options.

But without knowing T, I can't compute the integral. Wait, perhaps the temperature is 298 K, but that's the same as the given ΔH°, so that doesn't change anything.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to compute the ΔH for the reaction at 0 K or another reference point, but that seems unrelated to the given data.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about converting the given ΔH from kcal to kJ. Let's see: 1 kcal is 4.184 kJ. So, -22.08 kcal * 4.184 = approximately -92.2 kJ. But looking at the options, none of them match that.

Wait, looking at the options, option A is -20.38 kcal = -106.209 kJ. Option B is -25.38 kcal = same kJ. Option D is -25.38 kcal = -100.209 kJ.

Wait, perhaps the question is to calculate the ΔH at a different temperature. Let me try to proceed.

Let's say I need to compute ΔH at a temperature T. The initial ΔH is at 298 K.

The ΔCp is [2 Cp(NH3)] - [3 Cp(H2) + Cp(N2)].

Each Cp is given as a function of T:

Cp(H2) = 6.9469 - 0.1999e-3 T + 4.808e-7 T²
Cp(N2) = 6.5421 + 1.25e-3 T - 0.00717e-7 T²
Cp(NH3) = 6.1890 + 7.8872e-3 T -7.2801e-7 T²

So, let's compute ΔCp(T):

ΔCp = 2*(6.1890 + 7.8872e-3 T -7.2801e-7 T²) - [3*(6.9469 - 0.1999e-3 T +4.808e-7 T²) + (6.5421 + 1.25e-3 T -0.00717e-7 T²)]

Let me expand this:

= 2*6.1890 + 2*7.8872e-3 T + 2*(-7.2801e-7) T² - [3*6.9469 -3*0.1999e-3 T +3*4.808e-7 T² +6.5421 +1.25e-3 T -0.00717e-7 T²]

Compute each term:

2*6.1890 = 12.378
2*7.8872e-3 = 0.0157744
2*(-7.2801e-7) = -1.45602e-6

Now the terms in the brackets:

3*6.9469 = 20.8407
3*(-0.1999e-3) = -0.0005997
3*(4.808e-7) = 1.4424e-6
Adding the Cp(N2): 6.5421 +1.25e-3 T -0.00717e-7 T²

So, the bracket becomes:

20.8407 -0.0005997 T +1.4424e-6 T² + 6.5421 +1.25e-3 T -0.00717e-7 T²

Combine like terms inside the bracket:

Constants: 20.8407 +6.5421 = 27.3828
T terms: (-0.0005997 +0.00125) = 0.0006503 T
T² terms: (1.4424e-6) + (-0.00717e-7) = (1.4424 -0.00717)*1e-6 → 1.43523e-6 T²

So, the bracket is 27.3828 + 0.0006503 T + 1.43523e-6 T²

Putting it all together, ΔCp = [12.378 + 0.0157744 T -1.45602e-6 T²] - [27.3828 + 0.0006503 T +1.43523e-6 T²]

Subtract each term:

= 12.378 -27.3828 + (0.0157744 - 0.0006503) T + (-1.45602e-6 -1.43523e-6) T²

Calculating each:

Constants: 12.378 -27.3828 = -15.0048
T terms: 0.0157744 -0.0006503 = 0.0151241
T² terms: (-1.45602e-6 -1.43523e-6) = -2.89125e-6

So, ΔCp(T) = -15.0048 +0.0151241 T -2.89125e-6 T²

Now, to find ΔH(T), we have:

ΔH(T) = ΔH°(298) + ∫(from 298 to T) ΔCp dT

So, integrate ΔCp with respect to T:

Integral of ΔCp dT = ∫[ -15.0048 +0.0151241 T -2.89125e-6 T² ] dT

= -15.0048 T + (0.0151241 /2 ) T² - (2.89125e-6 /3 ) T^3 + C

So, the definite integral from 298 to T is:

[ -15.0048 T + 0.00756205 T² - 0.00096375e-6 T^3 ] evaluated from 298 to T.

So, the change in ΔH is the integral from 298 to T of ΔCp dT, which is:

[ -15.0048 T + 0.00756205 T² -0.00096375e-6 T^3 ] - [ -15.0048 *298 +0.00756205*(298)^2 -0.00096375e-6*(298)^3 ]

So, ΔH(T) = ΔH°(298) + [ -15.0048 (T -298) + 0.00756205 (T² -298²) -0.00096375e-6 (T^3 -298^3) ]

Wait, but without knowing T, I can't compute this. Hmm, perhaps the problem is to compute the ΔH at a specific temperature, but since the options don't mention T, maybe it's at a different standard temperature, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to compute the standard enthalpy change using the heat capacities, but that doesn't make sense because ΔH° is already given.

Wait, maybe the question is to compute the ΔH at 0 K, but that's a stretch. Alternatively, perhaps the Cp data is used to find the ΔH at a standard condition, but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing a key point here. Let me think again. The question might be to compute the ΔH at a certain temperature, say T, but without knowing T, perhaps T is 298 K, which would make the ΔH the same as ΔH°, but that doesn't fit the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is to find the ΔH in J or kJ,
