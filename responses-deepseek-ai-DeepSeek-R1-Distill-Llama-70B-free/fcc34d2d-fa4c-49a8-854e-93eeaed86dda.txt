"Those whose condition is such that their function is the use of their bodies and nothing better can be expected of them, those, I say, are slaves of nature. It is better for them to be ruled thus."
Juan de Sepulveda, Politics, 1522
"When Latin American nations gained independence in the 19th century, those two strains converged, and merged with an older, more universalist, natural law tradition. The result was a distinctively Latin American form of rights discourse. Paolo Carozza traces the roots of that discourse to a distinctive application, and extension, of Thomistic moral philosophy to the injustices of Spanish conquests in the New World. The key figure in that development seems to have been Bartolomé de Las Casas, a 16th-century Spanish bishop who condemned slavery and championed the cause of Indians on the basis of a natural right to liberty grounded in their membership in a single common humanity. 'All the peoples of the world are humans,' Las Casas wrote, and 'all the races of humankind are one.' According to Brian Tierney, Las Casas and other Spanish Dominican philosophers laid the groundwork for a doctrine of natural rights that was independent of religious revelation 'by drawing on a juridical tradition that derived natural rights and natural law from human rationality and free will, and by appealing to Aristotelian philosophy.'"

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by reading it carefully.

The question is about maize cultivation among the native peoples of Mexico and asks which of the options it's most analogous to. The options are various activities like buffalo hunting, whaling, seal hunting, etc., each associated with different Native American groups.

Hmm, I remember that maize, or corn, was a staple crop for many Native American groups, especially in Mesoamerica and the regions that are now Mexico. Maize cultivation would be a form of agriculture, specifically farming. So I'm looking for an option that represents another group's primary agricultural activity.

Looking at the options:

A: Buffalo hunting among the Lakota Sioux. That's a hunting activity, not farming.

B: Whaling by the Makah. Whaling is more about hunting large sea mammals.

C: Seal hunting among the Inuit. Again, hunting, not farming.

D: Salmon fishing among the Chinook. Fishing, which is a food-gathering method but not exactly farming.

E: Cattle herding by the Apache. Herding is more like animal husbandry, but I'm not sure if that's the same as crop cultivation.

F: Wolf domestication by the Algonquians. Domesticating animals, but the question is about maize, which is a plant.

G: Mixed agriculture among the Iroquois. Oh, this sounds like farming. The Iroquois were known for their agriculture, including the Three Sisters method of planting corn, beans, and squash together.

H: Deer hunting by the Seminole. Another hunting activity.

So maize cultivation is a form of agriculture, specifically farming. The closest match would be another agricultural practice. Option G is mixed agriculture among the Iroquois, which fits because both involve farming and cultivating crops.

Wait, but let me think again. Maize is a specific crop, while mixed agriculture implies growing multiple crops. But the question is about the activity being analogous, not the specific crop. So both maize cultivation and mixed agriculture are forms of farming, so they are analogous.

Alternatively, maybe another option could fit, like E, but cattle herding is about animals, not plants.

So I think the correct answer is G.

The question asks which activity is most analogous to maize cultivation among the native peoples of Mexico. Maize cultivation is a form of agriculture, specifically farming. Among the options, mixed agriculture among the Iroquois (Option G) is the most analogous, as it also involves farming and cultivating crops. Both activities center on plant cultivation, making them closely comparable.

Answer: G
