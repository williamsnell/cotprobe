Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about world hunger, poverty, and what Arthur is pointing out that Singer ignores. I remember that Singer wrote about this in his essay "Famine, Affluence, and Morality." In that essay, Singer argues that individuals in affluent countries have a moral obligation to help those in poverty, especially when they can do so without sacrificing anything morally significant.

Singer's argument is often contrasted with other ethical theories. I think he's a utilitarian, so he focuses on consequences and the greatest good for the greatest number. But other theories might focus more on rights, duties, or justice.

The question is about what Arthur is saying Singer ignores. So I need to think about what Singer's approach might overlook. Singer's main point is about our ability to help others in need. He uses the example of the drowning child—if you can save a child without great cost, you should. So his principle is more about the capacity to help and the duty to do so.

Wait, but the options are about what Singer ignores. So what does he not consider? Maybe something related to rights or desert, or perhaps justice and fairness beyond just helping.

I recall that some critics argue that Singer’s approach doesn’t account for the principles of justice and rights. Like, maybe he focuses too much on individual duties without considering broader structures or rights violations.

Looking at the options:

Option E is about rights and desert. Desert refers to what people deserve, so that's about merit or entitlement. Singer's argument doesn't really hinge on whether people deserve help based on their actions but rather on their need.

Option J is justice and fairness. Singer does talk about fairness in a way, but maybe Arthur is pointing out that Singer's approach doesn't fully address the justice aspect beyond individual actions.

Wait, another thought. There's a distinction between acts of charity and issues of justice. Singer might be seen as emphasizing charity—helping because you can—without addressing the systemic injustices that cause poverty. So perhaps Arthur is saying that Singer ignores the principles of justice and fairness in addressing the root causes.

Alternatively, another angle: Singer's principle is often summarized as "if you can help, you should." This relates to capacity and need. So the principle he's using is about need and capacity. If the question is what he ignores, maybe it's about something else.

Wait, the options are what Arthur says Singer ignores. So what does Singer not consider? Let me think about other ethical theories. For example, some theories focus on rights (like people have a right to assistance), others on justice, others on duties.

Singer's approach is more about the consequences of our actions—helping to reduce suffering. So perhaps he doesn't address the deontological aspects, like duties based on rights or justice.

Looking again, option E is rights and desert. Option J is justice and fairness. Which one is it?

I think in Singer's essay, he's criticized for not considering the broader justice issues. Like, maybe he's too focused on individual actions without addressing the systemic causes, which are issues of justice.

So Arthur might be pointing out that Singer ignores justice and fairness. So the answer would be option J.

Wait, but another point. There's a concept called the "principle of justice" which could relate to how resources are distributed. Singer's approach is more about individual moral obligations, not about whether the distribution is just.

So yes, I think the answer is J: the principles of justice and fairness.

The question revolves around what Arthur points out that Singer ignores concerning world hunger and poverty. Singer, in his essay "Famine, Affluence, and Morality," argues that individuals in affluent countries have a moral obligation to help those in need, based on their capacity to do so without significant sacrifice. This approach focuses on consequences and individual duties to assist.

However, critics argue that Singer's approach overlooks broader ethical considerations. Specifically, Singer's emphasis on individual actions and consequences may neglect systemic issues and structural injustices that cause poverty. Arthur likely critiques Singer for ignoring the principles of justice and fairness, which pertain to the root causes of poverty and the just distribution of resources, rather than merely addressing individual moral obligations.

Among the options provided, the most fitting answer is that Singer ignores the principles of justice and fairness.
