Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about lenses and their power. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

The question says that the image of a distant scene is focused sharply on a white card 40 cm away from the lens. Wait, I remember something about the focal length being related to the power of the lens. Oh right, power is the reciprocal of the focal length in meters.

So, the image is formed at 40 cm. But wait, when the object is at infinity, the image forms at the focal point. So for a distant object, the image distance is the focal length of the lens. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, I think when the object is at infinity, the image is at the focal point. So the distance given here, 40 cm, must be the focal length.

Wait, but wait. The problem says the image is focused on a white card held 40 cm from the lens. So that implies that the focal length f is 40 cm because the image forms there when the object is far away. So f is 0.4 meters.

Power of the lens is 1/f, where f is in meters. So 1 divided by 0.4 meters is 2.5 diopters. Oh wait, because 1 meter is 1 diopter. So 1/0.4 is 2.5. So the power would be 2.5 diopters.

Looking at the options, option A is 2.5 diopters. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but wait another thing. What if I'm confusing object and image distances? Let me think again. The lens formula is 1/f = 1/u + 1/v. For a distant object, u approaches infinity, so 1/u is zero. So 1/f = 1/v. That means v is f. So yes, when the object is at infinity, image distance v equals f. So the 40 cm is indeed the focal length.

So the calculation is correct. 40 cm is 0.4 m. 1/0.4 is 2.5. So the power is 2.5 diopters, which is option A.

To determine the power of the lens, we start by noting that the image of a distant scene is focused sharply on a white card 40 cm away from the lens. When the object is at infinity, the image forms at the focal point of the lens. Therefore, the distance to the white card (40 cm or 0.4 m) corresponds to the focal length \( f \) of the lens.

The power \( P \) of a lens is defined as the reciprocal of the focal length in meters:

\[
P = \frac{1}{f}
\]

Substituting \( f = 0.4 \, \text{m} \):

\[
P = \frac{1}{0.4} = 2.5 \, \text{diopters}
\]

Thus, the power of the lens is 2.5 diopters. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**A: 2.5 diopters**
