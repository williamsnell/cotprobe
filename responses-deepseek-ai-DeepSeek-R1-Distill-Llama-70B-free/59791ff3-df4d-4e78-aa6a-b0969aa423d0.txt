Okay, so I've got this genetics problem about minks and their fur color. Hmm, I remember that genetics questions often involve dominant and recessive traits. Let me read the question again to make sure I get it right.

The question says that in minks, the gene for brown fur (B) is dominant over the gene for silver fur (b). So, brown is dominant, silver is recessive. Got it. And the question is about a cross that could produce offspring with silver fur, but both parents have brown fur.

So, the parents both have brown fur, but they might carry the recessive gene. Because only if both pass on the recessive gene would the offspring be silver. Because recessive traits only show when the genotype is homozygous recessive, right?

Wait, let me think. If both parents have brown fur, their possible genotypes could be BB or Bb. Because BB is homozygous dominant (so they'll definitely have brown fur), and Bb is heterozygous (so they have brown fur but carry the recessive allele).

So, the question is asking which set of genotypes (the parents' genotypes) would result in some of their offspring being silver. Silver fur is the recessive trait, so the offspring would need to have bb genotype.

So let's look at the options.

Option A: bb and bb. Wait, that's both parents being homozygous recessive. But wait, if the parents are both silver, then all their offspring would be silver. But the question states that the parents have brown fur. So this option is invalid because the parents would have silver fur, not brown. So A is out.

Option B: Bb and BB. So one parent is heterozygous, the other is homozygous dominant. Let's see what their offspring would look like. The Bb parent can produce gametes B and b, and the BB parent can only produce B. So the possible offspring would be B (from Bb) and B (from BB) making BB, or b (from Bb) and B (from BB) making Bb. So the possible genotypes are BB (25%) and Bb (75%?), wait no, wait. Wait, Bb x BB. Let me calculate. Bb produces B and b gametes, each 50%. BB can only give B. So the possible offspring are:

B (from Bb's B) + B (from BB) → BB
or b (from Bb's b) + B (from BB) → Bb

So 50% BB and 50% Bb. Both of these have at least one dominant allele, so their fur is brown. So no silver offspring here. So option B can't be the answer.

Option C: Bb and Bb. So both parents are heterozygous. Let's see. Each can produce B or b gametes. So the possible offspring genotypes are:

BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%).

So 25% chance of bb, which is silver fur. So yes, this pairing could result in silver offspring. So option C is a possible correct answer.

Option D: Bb and bb. So one parent is heterozygous, the other is homozygous recessive. Let's see. The Bb parent produces B and b gametes (50% each), and the bb parent can only produce b gametes (100%). So the possible offspring are:

B (from Bb) + b (from bb) → Bb
or b (from Bb) + b (from bb) → bb.

So 50% Bb and 50% bb. So 50% chance of silver fur (bb). But wait, the question says the parents both have brown fur. Let's check the parents' phenotypes. The Bb parent has brown fur (dominant B), and the bb parent has silver fur (since homozygous recessive). But the question states that both parents have brown fur. So the option D has one parent (bb) with silver fur, which doesn't fit. So option D is invalid because one parent would have silver, which isn't what the question says. So D is out.

Option E: BB and Bb. So one parent is homozygous dominant, the other is heterozygous. Let's see. The BB parent can only give B gametes, the Bb parent can give B or b. So the possible offspring are:

B (from BB) + B (from Bb) → BB
B (from BB) + b (from Bb) → Bb.

So 50% BB and 50% Bb. Both phenotypes are brown. So no silver offspring. So E is not the right answer.

Option F: bb and Bb. Wait, same as option D but the order is reversed. One parent is bb (silver), the other Bb (brown). So again, one parent has silver fur, which doesn't fit the question's condition that both parents have brown. So F is out.

Option G: BB and BB. Both parents are homozygous dominant. All their offspring will be BB, which is brown. So no silver offspring here. So G is wrong.

Option H: Bb, Bb, Bb. Wait, but the question is about a cross between two parents. So this option lists three parents, which doesn't make sense. Or maybe it's a typo and they meant Bb and Bb? Or is H not a viable option? Because a cross is between two parents, so having three genotypes doesn't fit. So H seems invalid, probably a distractor.

Option I: BB and bb. So one parent is homozygous dominant (brown), the other is homozygous recessive (silver). But the question says both parents have brown fur, so the bb parent isn't brown. So I is invalid.

So the only option that fits is option C, where both parents are Bb. Because when they mate, 25% of the offspring will be bb (silver), and both parents themselves have brown fur.

Wait, but let me double-check the options. The question is phrased as "which set of genotypes represents a cross that could produce offspring with silver fur from parents that both have brown fur?"

So the parents must both have brown fur, i.e., their genotypes must be BB or Bb.

So the only option where both parents have brown fur (so their genotypes are either BB or Bb) and can produce a silver (bb) offspring is option C: Bb and Bb.

Because Bb x Bb → 25% bb.

In minks, the gene for brown fur (B) is dominant over the gene for silver fur (b). The question asks which set of genotypes represents a cross that could produce offspring with silver fur from parents that both have brown fur. Silver fur is recessive, so offspring must have the genotype **bb** to express silver fur. Both parents must have brown fur, meaning their genotypes can only be **BB** or **Bb**.

### Analysis of Each Option:
1. **Option A (bb, bb):** Both parents are homozygous recessive (silver fur). This is invalid because the question specifies that both parents have brown fur.
2. **Option B (Bb, BB):** One parent is heterozygous (Bb) and the other is homozygous dominant (BB). The possible offspring genotypes are **BB** (50%) and **Bb** (50%), both of which have brown fur. No silver offspring are produced, so this option is incorrect.
3. **Option C (Bb, Bb):** Both parents are heterozygous (Bb). The possible offspring genotypes are **BB** (25%), **Bb** (50%), and **bb** (25%). This cross can produce silver fur (bb), and both parents have brown fur. This option is correct.
4. **Option D (Bb, bb):** One parent is heterozygous (Bb) and the other is homozygous recessive (bb). The possible offspring genotypes are **Bb** (50%) and **bb** (50%). While this cross can produce silver fur, one parent (bb) has silver fur, which violates the condition that both parents must have brown fur. This option is invalid.
5. **Option E (BB, Bb):** One parent is homozygous dominant (BB) and the other is heterozygous (Bb). The possible offspring genotypes are **BB** (50%) and **Bb** (50%), both of which have brown fur. No silver offspring are produced, so this option is incorrect.
6. **Option F (bb, Bb):** This is the same as Option D but with the parents reversed. One parent has silver fur (bb), which violates the condition that both parents must have brown fur. This option is invalid.
7. **Option G (BB, BB):** Both parents are homozygous dominant (BB). All offspring will be **BB**, meaning all will have brown fur. No silver offspring are produced, so this option is incorrect.
8. **Option H (Bb, Bb, Bb):** This option lists three parents, which is not possible for a cross. This is invalid.
9. **Option I (BB, bb):** One parent is homozygous dominant (BB) and the other is homozygous recessive (bb). While this cross can produce heterozygous offspring (Bb), one parent (bb) has silver fur, which violates the condition that both parents must have brown fur. This option is invalid.

### Conclusion:
The only valid option is **C (Bb, Bb)**, as both parents have brown fur, and their cross can produce offspring with silver fur (bb).
