Question:

The ABC Pencil Co. was considering a price increase and wished to determine the elasticity of demand. An economist and a market researcher, Key and Worce, were hired to study demand. In a controlled experiment, it was determined that at 8\textcent, 100 pencils were sold yielding an elasticity of 2.25. However, key and worce were industrial spies, employed by the EF Pencil Co. And sent to ABC to cause as much trouble as possible. So key and worce decided to change the base for their elasticity figure, measuring price in terms of dollars instead of pennies ( i.e., $.08 for 8\textcent and $.10 for 10\textcent ). How will this sabotage affect the results?

Options:

A: The calculated elasticity will appear much higher, misleading the company
B: The change in base will create an illusion of inelastic demand
C: The elasticity measure will decrease
D: The price point for maximum revenue will appear to change dramatically
E: Elasticity is independent of the unit of measurement employed.
F: The price-demand curve will shift to the right
G: The elasticity measure will increase
H: The calculated elasticity will seem artificially low, causing confusion in pricing strategy
I: The sabotage will significantly affect the results
J: The demand will seem more elastic than it actually is

Okay, so I've got this economics question here about price elasticity of demand and how changing the unit of measurement affects it. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

The question says that ABC Pencil Co. is considering a price increase and wants to determine the elasticity. They hired Key and Worce, who are actually spies. In their experiment, at 8 cents, 100 pencils were sold, and the elasticity was calculated as 2.25. But these spies changed the base for elasticity by measuring price in dollars instead of pennies. So, 8 cents becomes $0.08 and 10 cents becomes $0.10, for example.

Wait, elasticity of demand is calculated using percentages. The formula is the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price. So, elasticity (Ed) = (%ΔQd)/(%ΔP).

If the price is measured in different units, like cents versus dollars, the actual numerical values change, but percentages should remain the same, right? Because percentages are relative. For instance, a 2-cent change when price is 8 cents is a 25% change. If you measure in dollars, 0.02 dollars over 0.08 is still 25%. So the percentage change in price is the same regardless of the unit.

Wait, but wait a second. Oh, no, wait. Wait, elasticity isn't just about the percentage changes. The actual formula uses the average of the initial and final values (midpoint formula) for both quantity and price. So, when calculating elasticity, the formula is:

Ed = ( (Q2 - Q1)/( (Q2 + Q1)/2 ) ) / ( (P2 - P1)/( (P2 + P1)/2 ) )

So, the absolute changes matter, but when you scale the units, like from cents to dollars, you're scaling P1 and P2 by a factor (like dividing by 100). Let's see how that affects the elasticity.

Let me take an example. Suppose P1 is 8 cents, which is $0.08, and P2 is 10 cents, which is $0.10.

The change in P is 2 cents or $0.02. The average price in cents is (8 + 10)/2 = 9 cents. In dollars, it's ($0.08 + $0.10)/2 = $0.09.

The percentage change in price when using cents: (2/9) ≈ 22.22%. When using dollars: (0.02 / 0.09) ≈ 22.22%. So same percentage.

Similarly, the quantity changes: let's say from 100 to 50 pencils. So Q1=100, Q2=50. The average quantity is (100 + 50)/2 = 75. The percentage change in quantity is ((-50)/75) ≈ -66.67%.

So elasticity is (66.67%)/(22.22%) ≈ 3.0.

Wait, but in the question, the original elasticity was 2.25. So maybe the numbers there are different. But regardless, the point is that when you change the unit, the percentage remains the same because the scaling factors cancel out.

Wait, but why? Because when you convert from cents to dollars, you're dividing each price by 100. So the change in price is also scaled by 1/100. But the average price is scaled by 1/100 as well. So the ratio (ΔP / average P) remains the same.

Because (ΔP_dollars) = (ΔP_cents)/100. Average P_dollars = (Average P_cents)/100.

So (ΔP_dollars / Average P_dollars) = ( (ΔP_cents/100) ) / ( (Average P_cents/100) ) ) = ΔP_cents / Average P_cents.

Same for the quantity: since quantity isn't changing units, the percentage change in quantity remains the same.

So the elasticity should be the same regardless of whether you measure price in cents or dollars.

Wait, but the question says that when they changed the base to dollars, how did it affect the results. So if the original elasticity was 2.25 when measured in cents, and correctly, in dollars it should also be 2.25, but perhaps the spies miscalculated it?

Alternatively, maybe they're using the absolute values instead of percentages. Like, perhaps they calculated using the absolute price changes without converting to percentages. But elasticity is a unitless measure because it's based on percentages.

Wait, maybe the confusion is about the formula. If they use the actual prices in different units without calculating percentages, that would change the elasticity.

Wait, let me think. Suppose they compute elasticity as (ΔQ/Q) / (ΔP/P), but if they measure P in different units, like cents vs dollars, the ratio ΔP/P could be different if not converted properly.

Wait no. Let me do an example. Suppose P1 = 8 cents, P2 = 10 cents. So ΔP = 2 cents. Let's compute the percentage change in price: (2/8) if using P1 as the base, or (2/10) if using P2 as the base, or the average as (2/(8+10)/2) = 2/9 ≈ 22.22%, as I did earlier.

If instead, the spies took the change in price as 2, and the average price as 9 (in cents), so 2/9. But if they measure in dollars, the change is 0.02, and average price is 0.09, so 0.02/0.09 is same as 2/9. So same result.

Wait, so it shouldn't matter. Then why would the elasticity change?

Alternatively, maybe they're not using percentage changes but absolute values. For example, using (Q2 - Q1)/ (P2 - P1). But that's not elasticity. Elasticity requires percentage changes.

So in the question, the spies changed the base for their elasticity figure, measuring in dollars instead of pennies. But as we saw, elasticity is unit-independent because it's based on percentages. So changing the unit shouldn't affect the elasticity value.

Wait, but the options say things like "elasticity will appear higher" or "lower". So if changing the unit doesn't affect elasticity, then the correct answer would be E: elasticity is independent of the unit.

Looking at the options:

E: Elasticity is independent of the unit of measurement employed.

But wait, the initial calculation by the spies was 2.25 when using pennies. If they changed to dollars, but did the calculation correctly, it would still be 2.25. But maybe they messed up the calculation.

Wait, perhaps they didn't recalculate using percentages but just changed the unit without adjusting. Let's say they computed it using the formula but in dollars. Wait, no, because the percentages are the same.

Wait a scenario: Suppose the correct way is to calculate the percentage change. But if they forget to convert to percentages, and just use the absolute values, that could change things. Wait, but no, because elasticity is about percentages. If they compute it correctly, unit shouldn't matter.

Wait, perhaps the question is a trick, because elasticity is unitless, so it's the same regardless, so the answer would be E.

But let me think again. The experiment found that at 8 cents, 100 pencils were sold, elasticity of 2.25. So when they change the base to dollars, they're perhaps presenting the same data but with price in dollars, which might not change the elasticity number. So the calculated elasticity remains the same.

Wait, but perhaps the spies didn't adjust the formula correctly. For example, when using cents, the price change is 2 cents, but when using dollars, it's 0.02 dollars. If they used the same formula but with dollars, would the absolute change matter?

Wait, no, because the percentage change is what matters. So let's say in one case, using cents:

ΔP = 2 cents. Average P = 9 cents. So %ΔP = (2/9)*100 ≈ 22.22%.

In dollars, ΔP = $0.02. Average P=$0.09. So same percentage.

So the percentage is same, so elasticity remains same.

Therefore, changing the unit doesn't affect the elasticity value. So the sabotage wouldn't have any effect. But looking at the options, option E says that.

Wait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let's think about absolute values versus percentages. Suppose the spies didn't use percentage changes but absolute changes. For example, in the formula, they might have used (ΔQ / ΔP) instead of percentages.

Wait, but elasticity is (ΔQ/Q) / (ΔP/P) = (ΔQ/ΔP) * (P/Q). So if they measure P in different units, say P in dollars vs cents, but Q is same, because it's quantity. So if they forgot to convert P to the same unit, it might affect the calculation.

Wait, for example, suppose originally, in cents: P=8, Q=100. After a change, P=10, Q=50.

So the absolute change in Q is -50, and absolute change in P is +2.

Elasticity using midpoints: ( (50-100)/( (50+100)/2 ) ) / ( (10-8)/( (10+8)/2 ) ) = (-50/75) / (2/9) )= (-0.6667) / (0.2222) )= -3. So absolute value is 3.

If they use dollars: P1=$0.08, P2=$0.10.

ΔP=0.02, Q same.

Elasticity: ( (50-100)/(75) ) / ( (0.10 - 0.08)/( (0.10+0.08)/2 ) ) = (-50/75) / ( 0.02 / 0.09 ) = same as before. So same result.

But wait, the initial elasticity in the question was 2.25, but in my example, I got 3. So perhaps the numbers are different.

Wait, but regardless, the calculation in dollars or cents gives the same elasticity.

So the conclusion is that changing the unit of measurement doesn't affect the elasticity value. So the calculated elasticity remains the same.

But the spies are trying to cause trouble. So if they changed the unit but the elasticity remains same, their sabotage had no effect. So the answer would be E: elasticity is independent of the unit.

Looking back at the options:

Option E: Elasticity is independent of the unit of measurement employed.

So the correct answer would be E.

But wait, let me check the other options to make sure.

Option A: Elasticity appears much higher — but that would be if the %ΔP was smaller, making elasticity higher. But since %ΔP is same, elasticity same.

Option C: Elasticity decreases — no, same.

Option H: Calculated elasticity seems low — no.

Option J: Demand more elastic than it is — no, same.

Thus, the answer should be E.

The question involves determining how changing the unit of measurement for price (from cents to dollars) affects the elasticity of demand. Elasticity of demand is calculated as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price. Since percentages are relative, changing the unit of measurement (e.g., from cents to dollars) does not alter the percentage changes in price or quantity demanded. Therefore, the elasticity value remains unchanged.

The spies' sabotage—changing the base for elasticity by measuring price in dollars instead of cents—does not affect the calculated elasticity because elasticity is a unitless measure that depends on percentage changes, not absolute values. Thus, the sabotage has no impact on the results, and the elasticity remains independent of the unit of measurement.

**Option Analysis:**

- **A, C, G, H, J:** These options suggest that elasticity becomes higher, lower, or otherwise distorted. However, since elasticity depends on percentage changes, which are unaffected by the unit of measurement, these options are incorrect.
- **D, F, I:** These options imply significant changes to revenue, demand curves, or results, which are not supported by the analysis. Elasticity remains unchanged, so these are incorrect.
- **E:** This option correctly states that elasticity is independent of the unit of measurement, as it is based on percentage changes. This is the correct answer.

**Answer:** E
