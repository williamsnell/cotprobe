Okay, so I've got this question about trusts and distributable net income. Hmm, I remember that distributable net income (DNI) is important for trusts because it determines how much income is passed on to the beneficiaries and is taxable to them. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact rules, so let me think this through.

The question gives me the income and expenses for Lake Trust, a simple trust. The items are: dividend income $2500, taxable interest income $2000, capital gains allocable to corpus $5000, accounting fees allocable to income $500, and trustee fees allocable to income $750.

Wait, first, I think that in a simple trust, the income that's required to be distributed currently is the DNI. DNI is calculated by taking the trust's taxable income and adjusting it with certain additions and subtractions.

So, the formula I recall is DNI = (Trust's taxable income) minus (capital gains allocable to corpus, plus certain other items like charitable deductions, etc.), but I'm not sure. Wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Let me get this straight.

The trust's taxable income is calculated under the standard rules, but DNI is the amount that is actually distributed or required to be distributed. So to find DNI, we start with the trust's taxable income and then make some adjustments.

Wait, I think the proper approach is to start with the trust's total income, subtract expenses and deductions, but considering what's allocable to income versus corpus.

Looking at the items:

Dividend income: $2500. I think dividends are generally part of taxable income, so they count.

Taxable interest income: $2000. Also part of taxable income.

Capital gains allocable to corpus: $5000. Hmm, capital gains can be a bit tricky. I remember that capital gains are generally allocated to corpus in a simple trust unless the trust document says otherwise. Since they're allocable to corpus, they don't factor into DNI. So, DNI would exclude these gains because they're added back to the trust's principal.

Now, the accounting fees: $500, allocated to income. So, I believe that means they're deductible against the income. Similarly, trustee fees: $750, also allocated to income, so deductible.

So, putting this together, the DNI would be the sum of the dividend and interest income minus the accounting and trustee fees, because those fees are expenses allocated to income. The capital gains are allocated to corpus, so they don't affect DNI.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, maybe it's the other way around. Let me think again. For a simple trust, the DNI is calculated as the sum of the trust's income that's to be distributed, after deducting expenses that are considered income expenses. So, capital gains allocable to corpus are not included in DNI, but the other income items are.

So, the steps would be:

1. Sum all the income that's part of DNI. That would be the dividend income and taxable interest income. So, $2500 + $2000 = $4500.

2. Subtract the expenses that are allocated to income. So, accounting fees ($500) and trustee fees ($750) are both subtracted. So, $4500 - ($500 + $750) = $4500 - $1250 = $3250.

Wait, but wait, what about the capital gains? Since they're allocated to corpus, they're not part of the DNI. So, the $5000 capital gains don't get added to the DNI. So, the DNI is $3250.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option J is $3250. So, the answer should be J.

But wait, another thought. Maybe I'm missing something. I remember that capital gains can sometimes be part of DNI, but only if they are allocable to income and not to corpus. In this case, the $5000 is allocable to corpus, so they're not included. So, yes, the DNI is just the sum of the other income minus the expenses allocated to income, which gives $3250. So, option J is correct.

To determine Lake Trust's distributable net income (DNI), we start by identifying the relevant items of income and expense. DNI is calculated by including income that is to be distributed or required to be distributed, while excluding items allocable to corpus and deducting expenses allocable to income.

1. **Income Items**:  
   - Dividend income: $2,500 (included in DNI).  
   - Taxable interest income: $2,000 (included in DNI).  
   - Capital gains: $5,000 (allocable to corpus, so excluded from DNI).  

   Total income included in DNI: $2,500 + $2,000 = $4,500.

2. **Expenses Allocable to Income**:  
   - Accounting fees: $500 (deductible from DNI).  
   - Trustee fees: $750 (deductible from DNI).  

   Total expenses allocable to income: $500 + $750 = $1,250.

3. **Calculation of DNI**:  
   Subtract the expenses allocable to income from the total income included in DNI:  
   $4,500 - $1,250 = $3,250.

Thus, Lake Trust's distributable net income is $3,250. The correct answer is:

J: $3,250.
