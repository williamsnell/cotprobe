Okay, so I have this question about compound interest, and I need to figure out which option is more profitable for Paul Reilly. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question says that Paul deposited $5,000 in a savings account that gives 4% interest annually. The money stays there for 3 years. He has a choice between having the interest compounded semiannually or quarterly. I need to determine which option will give him more money after those three years.

Wait, but looking at the options, the choices are labeled from A to J. The options given are various compounding periods. The question is asking between semiannual and quarterly compounding. So, the correct answer is probably between B (semiannually) and I (quarterly). But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about how compound interest works.

Compound interest means that the interest is calculated and added to the principal multiple times over the periods. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where:
- A is the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
- P is the principal amount ($5,000 here).
- r is the annual interest rate (decimal form, so 4% is 0.04).
- n is the number of times that interest is compounded per year.
- t is the time the money is invested for in years (3 years here).

So, for semiannual compounding, n would be 2 because it's compounded twice a year. For quarterly, n is 4 since it's compounded four times a year.

Let me calculate both scenarios.

First, semiannual:
n = 2, t=3, r=0.04, P=5000.

A_semi = 5000 * (1 + 0.04/2)^(2*3)
Let me compute that. 0.04 divided by 2 is 0.02. 2*3 is 6, so exponent is 6.

So, (1.02)^6. Let me calculate that. I remember that 1.02^6 is approximately 1.1268. So, 5000 * 1.1268 is about 5000 * 1.1268 = let's see, 5000 * 1 is 5000, 5000 * 0.1268 is 634, so total is 5634.

Wait, maybe I should compute that more accurately. Let me compute 1.02^6 step by step.

1.02^1 = 1.02
1.02^2 = 1.0404
1.02^3 = 1.061208
1.02^4 = 1.08243216
1.02^5 = 1.10408 (approx)
1.02^6 = approximately 1.126825

So yes, about 1.1268. So 5000 * 1.1268 = 5,634. So approximately $5,634.

Now, for quarterly compounding:

n=4, so each quarter, the rate is 0.04/4 = 0.01. The exponent is 4*3=12.

So A_quarterly = 5000*(1.01)^12.

I need to compute (1.01)^12. Let me think. I know that (1.01)^12 is approximately 1.12683. Alternatively, I can compute it step by step.

1.01^2 = 1.0201
1.01^3 = 1.030301
1.01^4 = 1.04060401
1.01^5 = 1.05101005
1.01^6 ≈ 1.06152015
1.01^7 ≈ 1.07213535
1.01^8 ≈ 1.08285670
1.01^9 ≈ 1.09368526
1.01^10 ≈ 1.10462211
1.01^11 ≈ 1.11566739
1.01^12 ≈ 1.12682499

So (1.01)^12 ≈ 1.126825.

So A_quarterly = 5000 * 1.126825 ≈ 5,634.13.

Wait, that's very close to the semiannual amount, but maybe a tiny bit higher. Let me check the exact numbers.

Wait, for semiannual, 1.02^6 is approximately 1.126825, same as 1.01^12. So both give the same amount? But that can't be right because I thought more frequent compounding gives more interest.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, another approach: let's compute both accurately.

For semiannual:

Each period, the rate is 0.04/2=0.02. Number of periods: 2*3=6.

Amount = 5000*(1.02)^6.

Compute (1.02)^6:

1.02^2 = 1.0404.

1.02^4 = (1.0404)^2 = approx 1.082432.

1.02^6 = 1.082432 * (1.0404) * (1.02) ?

Wait, no, 1.02^6 is 1.02^2 * 1.02^2 *1.02^2 = (1.0404)^3.

Wait, 1.0404^3: compute that.

1.0404 *1.0404 = approx 1.082432.

Then, 1.082432 *1.0404.

Let me compute that: 1.082432 * 1.0404.

Multiply 1.082432 * 1.04 = approx 1.082432 * 1 = 1.082432, 1.082432 *0.04= 0.043297. Sum is 1.125729.

Then, 1.125729 * 0.0004 (since 0.0404 is 0.04 + 0.0004). So 1.125729 * 0.0004 is approx 0.0004503.

So total is 1.125729 + 0.0004503 ≈ 1.12618.

Wait, so perhaps 1.02^6 is approximately 1.126825, but my calculation here gives around 1.12618. Hmm, not sure about the exact number, but maybe it's better to use a calculator approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the two amounts are very close but the quarterly gives a slightly higher amount. Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, let me compute (1.02)^6 more accurately.

(1.02)^1 = 1.02

(1.02)^2 = 1.0404

(1.02)^3 = 1.0404 *1.02. Let's compute that: 1.0404 *1.02.

Multiply 1.04 *1.02 = 1.0608, and 0.0004 *1.02 = 0.000408. So sum is 1.061208.

(1.02)^4 = 1.061208 *1.02.

Compute 1.061208 *1.02:

1 *1.02=1.02, 0.061208 *1.02= approx 0.062452. So sum is 1.02 + 0.062452 = 1.082452.

(1.02)^5 = 1.082452 *1.02.

1.082452 *1.02: 1*1.02=1.02, 0.082452*1.02= approx 0.084138. So sum is 1.02 + 0.084138 = 1.104138.

(1.02)^6 = 1.104138 *1.02.

1.104138 *1.02: 1*1.02=1.02, 0.104138*1.02= approx 0.106242. Sum is 1.02 + 0.106242 = 1.126242.

So (1.02)^6 ≈ 1.126242.

So the semiannual amount is 5000 * 1.126242 ≈ 5,631.21.

Now, quarterly:

(1.01)^12.

Let me compute step by step.

(1.01)^1 = 1.01

(1.01)^2 = 1.0201

(1.01)^3 = 1.030301

(1.01)^4 = 1.04060401

(1.01)^5 = 1.0510100501

(1.01)^6 = 1.0510100501 *1.01 = let's compute 1.05101005 *1.01.

1.05101005 * 1 = 1.05101005

1.05101005 * 0.01 = 0.0105101005

Sum: 1.05101005 + 0.0105101005 ≈ 1.06152015.

(1.01)^7 = 1.06152015 *1.01.

1.06152015 *1 = 1.06152015

1.06152015 *0.01 = 0.0106152015

Sum: ≈1.07213535.

(1.01)^8 = 1.07213535 *1.01.

1.07213535 *1 = 1.07213535

1.07213535 *0.01 = 0.0107213535

Sum: ≈1.0828567035.

(1.01)^9 = 1.0828567035 *1.01.

1.0828567035 *1 = 1.0828567035

1.0828567035 *0.01 = 0.010828567035

Sum: ≈1.09368527.

(1.01)^10 = 1.09368527 *1.01.

1.09368527 *1 = 1.09368527

1.09368527 *0.01 = 0.0109368527

Sum: ≈1.104622123.

(1.01)^11 = 1.104622123 *1.01.

1.104622123 *1 = 1.104622123

1.104622123 *0.01 = 0.01104622123

Sum: ≈1.115668344.

(1.01)^12 = 1.115668344 *1.01.

1.115668344 *1 = 1.115668344

1.115668344 *0.01 = 0.01115668344

Sum: ≈1.126825027.

So (1.01)^12 ≈1.126825.

So the quarterly amount is 5000 * 1.126825 ≈ 5,634.13.

Comparing the two, semiannual gives approximately $5,631.21, and quarterly gives approximately $5,634.13. So quarterly gives a bit more, about $2.92 more.

Wait, but that's a small difference. So the more frequent the compounding, the higher the interest. So quarterly is better than semiannual. So the answer should be compounded quarterly, which is option I.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Options are A to J.

The question says Paul can have interest compounded semiannually or quarterly. So the options are between B (semiannually) and I (quarterly). So the correct choice is I, which is option I.

Alternatively, let me check if any other options are more frequent, like monthly (H), weekly (E), etc., but the question only gives the choice between semiannual and quarterly.

So in this case, between B and I, I is quarterly which gives a slightly higher amount, so the answer is I.
</think>

To determine which compounding method is more profitable for Paul Reilly, we analyze the two options: semiannual and quarterly compounding. The formula for compound interest is:

\[
A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}
\]

Where:
- \(P = 5000\) (principal amount),
- \(r = 0.04\) (annual interest rate),
- \(n = \text{number of compounding periods per year}\),
- \(t = 3\) (years).

### Semiannual Compounding:
- \(n = 2\) (compounded twice a year),
- \(\frac{r}{n} = \frac{0.04}{2} = 0.02\),
- \(nt = 2 \times 3 = 6\),
- \(A = 5000 \times (1 + 0.02)^6\).

Calculating \((1.02)^6\):
\[
(1.02)^6 \approx 1.126242
\]
\[
A \approx 5000 \times 1.126242 = 5631.21
\]

### Quarterly Compounding:
- \(n = 4\) (compounded four times a year),
- \(\frac{r}{n} = \frac{0.04}{4} = 0.01\),
- \(nt = 4 \times 3 = 12\),
- \(A = 5000 \times (1 + 0.01)^{12}\).

Calculating \((1.01)^{12}\):
\[
(1.01)^{12} \approx 1.126825
\]
\[
A \approx 5000 \times 1.126825 = 5634.13
\]

### Comparison:
- Semiannual compounding yields approximately $5,631.21.
- Quarterly compounding yields approximately $5,634.13.

Quarterly compounding results in a slightly higher amount ($5,634.13 vs. $5,631.21), making it the more profitable option. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**I: Compounded quarterly.**
