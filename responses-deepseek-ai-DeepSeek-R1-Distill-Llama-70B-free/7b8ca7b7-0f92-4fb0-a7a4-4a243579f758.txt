Okay, so I've got this question here about the percentage of children aged 13-15 in Egypt who reported being bullied at least once in the past couple of months as of 2015. The options are from A to J, with various percentages. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct answer.

First, I should think about what I know regarding bullying statistics, especially in Egypt around that time. I remember that bullying can vary a lot by country and culture. Egypt is a country in the Middle East with a large population, and I think their education system might have different dynamics compared to Western countries.

Wait, I recall that in some developing countries, the rates of bullying can be higher than in developed nations. But I'm not sure about the exact numbers. I think organizations like UNICEF or the World Health Organization might have conducted studies on this.

I also remember that the Global School-based Student Health Survey (GSHS) collects data on various health behaviors, including violence and bullying. Maybe the data from that survey around 2015 would have the information needed.

Let me try to break it down. The question is specifically about children aged 13-15, so early teenagers. Bullying in this age group can be significant. From what I've heard, some countries have higher rates, like around 40-50%, but I'm not certain about Egypt.

Looking at the options: the choices range from 10% to 100%. That's a big range. I know that 100% is impossible because not every child is bullied. So H is out. Similarly, 10% seems too low unless the country has very low bullying rates, which I don't think is the case for Egypt.

Options are A:60%, B:80%, C:90%, D:20%, E:70%, F:10%, G:50%, I:40%, J:30%. So, the plausible ones are probably in the 20-80 range.

I think I've heard that in some Middle Eastern countries, bullying rates are around 40-50%. But I'm not sure if that's accurate. Alternatively, I might be confusing it with another region.

Wait, I remember a report from around that time stating that Egypt had a bullying rate of about 40% among adolescents. Or was it higher? Let me think. I think a 2015 study showed that around 40% of children in Egypt reported being bullied. So that would correspond to option I:40%.

But wait, I'm not entirely confident. Another angle: sometimes the percentage can be higher, like 60-70%, especially if considering both bullying and being bullied at school. Or maybe the question is about being bullied or bullying others.

Alternatively, I might be mixing up the data with another country. For example, some European countries have lower rates, like around 20-30%, but Egypt might have a higher rate.

Wait, I think I should consider the source more carefully. If it's from a reliable source like the GSHS, then the numbers are more trustworthy. Let me try to recall: The GSHS for Egypt in 2015 found that about 40% of students aged 13-15 were bullied.

Yes, that sounds right. So the correct answer would be I:40%.

The correct answer is I:40%.
