Okay, so I've got this statistics problem in front of me, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's see... The question is about finding the sample size needed for a certain confidence level and maximum error. Hmm.

Alright, the problem states that X is the tarsus length for a male grackle, and it follows a normal distribution N(μ, 4.84). I think that notation means the variance is 4.84 because in statistics, when we write N(μ, σ²), the second parameter is the variance. So the standard deviation would be the square root of 4.84. Let me calculate that real quick. Oh wait, sqrt(4.84) is 2.2 because 2.2 squared is 4.84. So σ is 2.2.

The question asks for the sample size n such that we're 95% confident that the maximum error of the estimate of μ is 0.4. Right, so this sounds like a confidence interval problem. The formula for the confidence interval is μ ± margin of error. The margin of error (E) is given as 0.4, and the confidence level is 95%.

I remember the formula for the margin of error when the population standard deviation is known is E = Z*(σ/√n), where Z is the critical value from the standard normal distribution corresponding to the desired confidence level. For a 95% confidence interval, the Z-score is approximately 1.96. I think that's correct because 95% confidence leaves 5% in the tails, 2.5% on each side, and the Z value for that is about 1.96.

So, plugging the numbers in, we have 0.4 = 1.96 * (2.2 / sqrt(n)). I need to solve for n here. Let me rearrange the formula. 

First, divide both sides by 1.96: 0.4 / 1.96 = 2.2 / sqrt(n). Let me compute 0.4 divided by 1.96. Hmm, 0.4 divided by 2 is 0.2, but since it's 1.96, it's a bit more. Let me calculate it: 0.4 / 1.96 ≈ 0.2041. So, 0.2041 ≈ 2.2 / sqrt(n). 

Now, I can solve for sqrt(n) by rearranging: sqrt(n) ≈ 2.2 / 0.2041. Let me compute that. 2.2 divided by 0.2041 is approximately 10.78. So sqrt(n) is about 10.78. 

To find n, I square that value: n ≈ (10.78)^2. Let me calculate 10 squared is 100, and 0.78 squared is about 0.6084, but wait, actually, I should calculate 10.78 * 10.78 properly. 10 *10 is 100, 10*0.78 is 7.8, 0.78*10 is another 7.8, and 0.78*0.78 is approximately 0.6084. Adding those: 100 + 7.8 +7.8 + 0.6084 = 116.2084. So n is approximately 116.2084. 

But wait, the sample size has to be an integer, so you round up because you can't have a fraction of a sample. So n would be 117. Let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait, let me recalculate 0.4 divided by 1.96. Let me do this more accurately. 1.96 * 0.2041 is about 0.4. Yes, that's correct. Then 2.2 divided by 0.2041 is indeed approximately 10.78. Squaring that gives around 116.2, so 117 is correct.

Looking at the options, F is 117. So the answer should be F.

To determine the required sample size \( n \) for estimating the population mean \( \mu \) with a 95% confidence level and a maximum error of 0.4, we use the formula for the margin of error:

\[
E = Z \cdot \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
\]

Here:
- \( E = 0.4 \) (maximum error),
- \( Z = 1.96 \) (critical value for 95% confidence),
- \( \sigma = 2.2 \) (population standard deviation, calculated as \( \sqrt{4.84} \)).

Rearranging the formula to solve for \( n \):

\[
n = \left( \frac{Z \cdot \sigma}{E} \right)^2
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
n = \left( \frac{1.96 \cdot 2.2}{0.4} \right)^2
\]

First, calculate \( \frac{1.96 \cdot 2.2}{0.4} \):

\[
\frac{1.96 \cdot 2.2}{0.4} = \frac{4.312}{0.4} = 10.78
\]

Then, square the result:

\[
n = (10.78)^2 = 116.2084
\]

Since \( n \) must be an integer, we round up to the next whole number, giving \( n = 117 \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**F: 117**
