Question:

The owner of a large unimproved tract of land leased it to a tenant for five years at a monthly rental of $1,500. The rental agreement provided that the land was to be used as farmland. Shortly after the tenant took possession of the tract of land, he built thereon, at his own expense, a barn made of lumber, which was 15 feet wide, 20 feet long, and set on loose bricks. The barn increased the appraised market value of the tract of land from $250,000 to $275,000. The tenant then began farming operations on the land. Toward the end of the lease period, the owner informed the tenant that he was going to put the tract of land up for sale. The next month, when the lease expired, the parties settled a dispute over the tenant's right, if any, to compensation for the improvements by the following written agreement:"On the sale of the tract of land, the owner hereby agrees to pay the tenant two-thirds of any sale proceeds in excess of $250,000, provided that tenant may remain on the farm for the next year, rent-free, while the owner tries to sell it. After that time, the tenant may remain on the land until closing of the sale, at a monthly rental of $1,000. "The owner initially set the asking price at $300,000. After receiving scant interest, the owner decided to reduce the price to $260,000. This price reduction so infuriated the tenant that he thereafter made negative comments about the farm to all of the prospective buyers. Finally, 14 months after the agreement between the owner and the tenant was executed, and after rejecting offers for $240,000 and $250,000, the owner sold the tract of land for $256,000 to a buyer who visited the land while the tenant was away on vacation. Thereupon, the tenant, who had failed to pay the last two months rent as per the agreement, moved out. After closing, the owner refused to pay the tenant any of the sale proceeds, and the tenant brought suit to recover damages for breach of contract. Which of the following is the owner's most persuasive argument in defense of the tenant's suit?

Options:

A: The tenant committed an uncured material breach of an implied promise to cooperate in the owner's efforts to sell the property, or at least not to hinder the proposed sale.
B: The owner's decision to reduce the asking price without consulting the tenant was a breach of their agreement.
C: The agreement between the owner and the tenant was voidable because it was a restraint on alienation, since it conditioned a promise to pay for a conveyance of land upon an otherwise invalid leasehold contract.
D: The tenant failed to maintain the property in a presentable state for potential buyers, thereby breaching his responsibilities under the agreement.
E: The tenant's failure to pay any rent for the last two months was a material breach of contract that discharged the owner's remaining duties of performance.
F: The owner had no legal obligation to share the proceeds of the sale as the tenant had continued to live on the property rent-free for a year.
G: The owner's agreement to pay the tenant was conditional upon the sale price exceeding $250,000, which it did not.
H: The tenant's decision to farm the land was against the rental agreement and hence, a violation of the contract.
I: The tenant's construction of the barn without the owner's explicit permission was a breach of the lease agreement.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out this legal problem, and I need to break it down step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

So, the situation is about a landlord-tenant relationship. The owner leased land to a tenant for five years. The lease included that the land would be used as farmland. The tenant built a barn on the property, which increased the land's value. Then, when the lease was ending, the owner and tenant made a written agreement about selling the land. The owner would pay the tenant two-thirds of any sale proceeds over $250k, but the tenant could stay rent-free for a year and then pay reduced rent until the sale closed.

Now, the owner tried to sell the land, first asking $300k, then dropping to $260k, which made the tenant angry. The tenant started badmouthing the farm to potential buyers. After a year, the owner sold it for $256k. The tenant didn't pay the last two months' rent and moved out. The owner refused to pay the tenant any proceeds, so the tenant sued.

The question is about the owner's best defense against the tenant's breach of contract claim. The options are A through I.

I need to think about contract law here. The main issues seem to revolve around the agreement they made after the lease ended. Let's look at the written agreement's terms. The owner agreed to pay the tenant two-thirds of any sale proceeds above $250k, but only if the tenant stayed rent-free for a year and then paid $1k monthly until closing.

The tenant's actions: He failed to pay the last two months' rent and also made negative comments to buyers. So, did he breach the contract?

Looking at the options:

Option A says the tenant breached an implied promise to cooperate in selling the property. That sounds plausible because when someone is trying to sell, the tenant's actions could hinder that. Making negative comments could deter buyers.

Option B suggests the owner breached by reducing the price without consulting. But the agreement doesn't specify that the owner must consult the tenant on pricing, so this might not hold.

Option C talks about restraint on alienation. I remember that contracts which unreasonably restrict the ability to sell property can be void. But the agreement here doesn't prevent sale; it's about payment upon sale. So maybe C is incorrect.

Option D is about maintaining the property. The tenant built a barn, which increased value, but if he failed to maintain it, that could be a breach. However, the facts don't mention poor maintenance, so D may not apply.

Option E states the tenant's failure to pay rent was a material breach. The agreement after the lease had the tenant paying $1k monthly after the first year. If he didn't pay the last two months, that's a breach. But if the owner's obligation was conditioned on the sale proceeds exceeding $250k, which they did ($256k), then E could be a defense. But the owner's obligation might still exist regardless of the tenant's breach, unless it's a material breach that discharges the duty.

Option F claims the owner had no obligation because the tenant lived rent-free for a year. But the agreement says the tenant can stay rent-free for a year, so F doesn't seem right.

Option G says the sale price didn't exceed $250k, but it didâ€”it was $256k. So G is incorrect.

Option H says farming violated the agreement, but the lease was for farmland, so that's allowed. H is wrong.

Option I suggests the barn was built without permission, breaching the lease. But the lease doesn't forbid improvements, and the barn increased the value, so I might not be the best argument.

So, the main options are A and E. The owner's best defense would be that the tenant breached an implied duty to cooperate. In real estate sales, the tenant's cooperation is often implied because the tenant's actions can significantly affect the sale. If the tenant actively discouraged buyers, that's a material breach.

Alternatively, the tenant's failure to pay rent (option E) might be a breach, but the owner's obligation was tied to the sale proceeds, not the tenant's payment. Unless the agreement made the owner's payment conditional on the tenant fulfilling all obligations, including rent, then E could apply.

Looking at the agreement, it says the tenant may remain rent-free for a year, then pay $1k. So the tenant's duty to pay arises after the first year. The tenant didn't pay the last two months (which would be after the first year). So that's a breach. But does that discharge the owner's obligation to pay two-thirds over $250k?

In contract law, a material breach by one party can discharge the other's obligations. But the owner's payment is based on the sale proceeds, which the tenant helped increase. If the tenant breached by not paying rent, but the owner still sold the property, the owner might argue that the tenant's breach justifies not paying.

However, the more compelling argument might be that the tenant hindered the sale by discouraging buyers, which is a breach of the implied covenant to cooperate. This could have prevented the owner from getting a higher price, which would have benefited the tenant as well since he was entitled to two-thirds of the excess. So, the tenant's actions might have caused the sale to be lower than possible, but in this case, the sale was $256k, which is still above $250k. So the tenant's actions didn't prevent the sale from exceeding $250k, but they might have affected the owner's ability to get a higher price.

Wait, but the sale was still completed. The owner sold it for $256k, so the condition was met. The tenant's negative comments might not have prevented the sale but could have hindered getting a higher price.

Alternatively, the tenant's failure to pay rent is a clear breach. If the agreement was that after the first year, the tenant pays $1k a month until closing, and he failed to pay the last two months, that's a breach. Whether it's material depends on the circumstances. Two months at $1k each is $2k. If the sale was $256k, two-thirds of ($6k) is $4k. The tenant would have been owed $4k, but he breached by not paying $2k. So perhaps the owner can deduct the $2k from the $4k, but if the agreement is clear that the tenant must pay, his breach might allow the owner to withhold all payments.

But I'm not sure if the failure to pay rent would discharge the owner's obligation entirely. It might allow the owner to offset the debt but not withhold the entire payment.

Comparing options A and E, which is a stronger defense. Option A's argument is about cooperation. If the tenant actively discouraged buyers, that's a material breach of the implied duty to cooperate in the sale. This could be a more significant breach because it directly affects the owner's ability to sell the property at a good price. The owner might argue that because of the tenant's actions, the sale price was lower than it could have been, thus reducing the amount the tenant would receive. But in this case, the sale did happen, and the price was above $250k.

Alternatively, the tenant's breach of not paying rent (E) might not be as directly linked to the owner's performance. The owner's obligation is to pay a portion of the proceeds, which the tenant helped create by improving the property.

Wait, the barn increased the value, so the tenant's improvement is the basis for the owner's higher sale price. If the tenant breached by not paying rent, does that negate his right to the increased proceeds? Or is the owner's obligation separate from the tenant's obligations under the agreement?

I think the written agreement creates a contract where the owner's duty to pay is conditioned on the tenant's compliance with the terms, such as staying on the property and paying rent after the first year. If the tenant failed to pay, that might justify the owner withholding payment.

But another angle is that the agreement was a contract where the consideration from the tenant was allowing the owner to sell by staying on the property, and perhaps not hindering the sale. If the tenant acted to hinder the sale, that's a breach.

Hmm, so which is the stronger argument? I'm a bit torn between A and E.

Option A is about an implied promise to cooperate. Courts often imply such terms in contracts, especially in situations where cooperation is necessary for the contract's purpose. So if the tenant's negative comments were a deliberate attempt to hinder the sale, that's a breach.

Option E is about a clear, express termâ€”failure to pay rent. If the tenant didn't pay, that's a breach. But whether that breach justifies the owner withholding the sale proceeds depends on whether the obligations are independent or dependent. If the owner's payment is a separate obligation, then the tenant's breach of another term might not discharge it unless it's a material breach.

Alternatively, the written agreement's terms might tie the payment to the tenant's performance. Let me re-read the agreement:

"On the sale of the tract of land, the owner hereby agrees to pay the tenant two-thirds of any sale proceeds in excess of $250,000, provided that tenant may remain on the farm for the next year, rent-free, while the owner tries to sell it. After that time, the tenant may remain on the land until closing of the sale, at a monthly rental of $1,000."

So, the payment is conditioned on the tenant remaining on the farm for a year rent-free, and then paying $1k monthly. So the tenant's obligation is to stay and pay after the first year. If the tenant failed to pay, that could be a breach, allowing the owner to withhold payment.

But the tenant did stay on the land, as required. He only failed to pay the last two months. So the issue is whether that failure constitutes a material breach that would allow the owner to refuse payment.

In contract law, a material breach justifies the non-breaching party to withhold performance. Here, the tenant's breach is failure to pay $2k. The owner's obligation is to pay the tenant $4k (two-thirds of $6k). So, if the tenant's breach is material, the owner can refuse to pay anything. But if it's not material, the owner might have to pay the $4k minus the $2k owed.

But whether it's material depends on the context. $2k might not be material compared to the total proceeds, but it's possible the court would see it as a significant issue, especially since the tenant's payment was a condition for remaining on the land.

Alternatively, the owner's argument in option A is that the tenant's actions hindered the sale, which is an implied duty. This could be seen as a more substantial breach because it affects the owner's ability to achieve the contract's purposeâ€”selling the land for the highest possible price.

In this case, the tenant's negative comments probably didn't prevent the sale but might have reduced the price. However, the sale still went through at a higher price than $250k, so the tenant's actions didn't entirely block the sale.

I think the stronger argument is A, that the tenant breached the implied promise to cooperate. Because without the tenant's cooperation, the owner's efforts to sell could be undermined. The negative comments could have been a hindrance, even if they didn't completely prevent a sale. This could be seen as a material breach, allowing the owner to withhold payment.

Alternatively, option E's argument about the tenant's failure to pay rent is a clear breach, but it's a smaller amount and might not be as significant in the context of the overall agreement.

So, I'm leaning towards option A being the most persuasive argument.
</think>

The owner's best defense lies in the tenant's breach of an implied promise to cooperate in the sale of the property. When the tenant made negative comments to prospective buyers, he hindered the owner's efforts to sell the land, which constitutes a material breach of the implied duty to act in good faith and cooperate in achieving the contract's purpose. This breach is more significant than the tenant's failure to pay the last two months' rent, as it directly impacted the owner's ability to secure a higher sale price, even though the sale ultimately proceeded. 

While the tenant's failure to pay rent (option E) is a clear breach, it is less persuasive as a defense because the owner's obligation to pay a portion of the sale proceeds is tied to the tenant's improvement of the property, which increased its value. In contrast, the tenant's active interference with the sale process (option A) undermines the very foundation of the agreement and provides a stronger basis for the owner to withhold payment.
