Okay, so I've got this question about electrical circuits, specifically dealing with lamps connected in parallel and how that affects the current from the power source. Hmm, let me think. I remember from my basic electronics class that when components are connected in parallel, each gets its own separate circuit path. So each lamp would have the same voltage across them because they're connected directly to the power source.

Wait, right, in a parallel circuit, the voltage across each branch is the same. So if each lamp is rated for the same voltage as the source, adding more lamps won't change the voltage each one gets. But what about the current? Oh, right, Ohm's Law says V=IR, so current I is V/R. So each lamp would draw a current based on its resistance.

If I have multiple lamps in parallel, each will draw their own current. So the total current from the power source would be the sum of the currents through each lamp. Oh, so when you add more lamps in parallel, each provides an additional path for the current. That means the total current increases because each lamp adds its own current to the total.

So the question is asking what happens as more lamps are connected in parallel. The options are about whether the current remains the same, decreases, increases, etc. Since each lamp adds to the total current, the current from the power source should increase.

Looking at the options: Option H says 'increases', which fits. Option E is 'decreases', which would be the opposite, so that's not right. Option D says 'triples', but that depends on how many lamps are added. Since the question is about a general trend as more are added, not a specific number, tripling isn't necessarily correct. Option A and C suggest no change, which isn't right because adding more paths should change the current.

So the correct answer should be H: increases.

When lamps are connected in parallel, each lamp receives the same voltage as the power source, and the current through each lamp depends on its resistance according to Ohm's Law (V = IR). As more lamps are added in parallel, each provides an additional path for the current, causing the total current drawn from the power source to increase. This is because the total current is the sum of the currents through each parallel branch. Therefore, as more lamps are connected, the current in the power source increases.

The correct answer is H: increases.
