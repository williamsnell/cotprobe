Question:

1.7(a) In an attempt to determine an accurate value of the gas constant, $R$, a student heated a container of volume $20.000 \mathrm{dm}^3$ filled with $0.25132 \mathrm{g}$ of helium gas to $500^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and measured the pressure as $206.402 \mathrm{cm}$ of water in a manometer at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Calculate the value of $R$ from these data. (The density of water at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is $0.99707 \mathrm{g} \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$; a manometer consists of a U-shaped tube containing a liquid. One side is connected to the apparatus and the other is open to the atmosphere. The pressure inside the apparatus is then determined from the difference in heights of the liquid.)

Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the gas constant R. Hmm, let me try to figure it out step by step. I remember from my chemistry class that the ideal gas law is PV = nRT. So I'll probably need to use that formula. 

The data given is: volume is 20.000 dm³, mass of helium is 0.25132 grams, temperature is 500 degrees Celsius, and the pressure is 206.402 cm of water in a manometer at 25 degrees Celsius. Also, the density of water at 25°C is given as 0.99707 g/cm³. 

Wait, okay, so I need to find R. So rearranging the ideal gas equation, R should be (PV)/(nT). But wait, let me make sure I get all the units right because that's always tricky.

First, let me note down all the given data and what I need to convert:

- Volume (V) = 20.000 dm³. Oh wait, 1 dm³ is equal to 1 liter, right? And since 1 m³ is 1000 liters, so 1 dm³ is 0.001 m³. Wait, but in the ideal gas law, the standard unit for volume is m³. So I should convert it to m³. So 20 dm³ is 20 * 0.001 = 0.02 m³.

- Mass (m) of helium = 0.25132 grams. I need to find moles (n). The molar mass of helium is about 4 g/mol because helium is He, atomic weight around 4. So n = m / M = 0.25132 g / 4 g/mol = 0.06283 mol. Let me calculate that. 0.25132 divided by 4 is 0.06283 exactly. So n = 0.06283 mol.

- Temperature (T) is 500°C. But in Kelvin, I add 273.15, so T = 500 + 273.15 = 773.15 K.

- Pressure (P) is given as 206.402 cm of water. Hmm, how to convert that to Pascals or atmospheres or whatever. Oh right, pressure from a fluid column is given by P = h * ρ * g, where h is height, ρ density, g gravitational acceleration.

Wait, I remember that 1 atm is about 10^5 Pa, but I'm not sure about the exact conversion. Alternatively, maybe I can calculate it in Pascals.

So the manometer measures the pressure as 206.402 cm of water. So h = 0.206402 meters? Wait, no, wait, 206.402 cm is 2.06402 meters. Wait wait no, wait: 1 meter is 100 cm, so 206.402 cm is 2.06402 meters. Wait, no, wait, that's not right. 206 cm is 2.06 meters, because 100 cm = 1 m. So 206.402 cm = 2.06402 m.

Wait no, wait. Wait, 206 cm is 2.06 m. Wait, but 206.402 cm is 2.06402 m. So h is 2.06402 meters.

Density of water is 0.99707 g/cm³. Wait, but that's grams per cm³. To convert to kg/m³, since 1 cm³ is 1e-6 m³, so 0.99707 g/cm³ is 997.07 kg/m³. Wait, because 1 g/cm³ is 1000 kg/m³. So 0.99707 g/cm³ is 997.07 kg/m³.

Gravity, g, is 9.80665 m/s², I think that's standard. So P = h * ρ * g. So P = 2.06402 m * 997.07 kg/m³ * 9.80665 m/s².

Let me compute that. So first, calculate h * rho: 2.06402 * 997.07. Let's see, 2 * 1000 is 2000, but precise calculation is better. 

Hmm, 2.06402 * 997.07. Let me compute:

2 * 997.07 = 1994.14
0.06402 * 997.07 = let's calculate that. 0.06 * 997.07 = 59.8242, and 0.00402 * 997.07 ≈ 4.007. So adding together, 59.8242 + 4.007 ≈ 63.8312. So total is 1994.14 + 63.8312 ≈ 2057.9712. So 2057.9712 kg/(m·s²) [since kg/m³ * m gives kg/(m²)].

Wait, no. Wait, h is in meters, rho in kg/m³, so h*rho is kg/m². Multiply by g (m/s²), so P is kg/(m·s²) which is equivalent to Pascals (Pa). So 2057.9712 kg/(m·s²) * 9.80665 m/s²?

Wait, no, wait. Wait, h*rho gives kg/m², then multiplied by g (m/s²) gives (kg·m)/(s²·m²) ) = kg/(m·s²) which is Pascals.

So P = 2057.9712 * 9.80665. Let me compute that.

Hmm, 2000 * 9.80665 is 19,613.3. Then 57.9712 * 9.80665 ≈ let's see, 50 *9.8 ≈ 490, 7.97 *9.8≈78. So roughly 568. So total P ≈ 19613.3 + 568 = 20181.3 Pa. Wait, but let me compute more accurately.

Wait, 2057.9712 * 9.80665:

Let me break it down:

2057.9712 * 9 = 18521.7408
2057.9712 * 0.80665 = let's compute that.

0.8 * 2057.9712 = 1646.37696
0.00665 * 2057.9712 ≈ 13.704 (since 0.00665 is approximately 0.006 + 0.00065, so 2057.9712 * 0.006 = 12.3478, and 2057.9712 * 0.00065 = 1.3374. So total ≈ 12.3478 + 1.3374 ≈ 13.6852. So 0.80665 * 2057.9712 ≈ 1646.37696 + 13.6852 ≈ 1660.06216.

So total P ≈ 18521.7408 + 1660.06216 = 20181.803 Pa.

Wait, but let me double-check using calculator steps:

Alternatively, 2057.9712 * 9.80665 = ?

Let me compute 2057.9712 * 9.80665:

Perhaps it's better to do exact multiplication.

But perhaps I can use an approximate value. Let me see, 2058 * 9.8 is approximately 2058 *10 = 20580, minus 2058*0.2=411.6, so about 20168.4. But the exact value would be a bit higher because 9.80665 is a bit more than 9.8.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the precise method:

But maybe I should instead compute 2.06402 m * 997.07 kg/m³ * 9.80665 m/s².

Wait, 2.06402 * 997.07 = 2.06402 * 997.07. Let me compute that.

Let me compute 2 * 997.07 = 1994.14.

0.06402 * 997.07.

Compute 0.06 * 997.07 = 59.8242.

0.00402 * 997.07 = approx 4.007.

So 59.8242 +4.007=63.8312. So total 1994.14 +63.8312 = 2057.9712 kg/m².

Then multiply by 9.80665 m/s²: 2057.9712 * 9.80665.

Let me compute:

2057.9712 * 9 = 18,521.7408

2057.9712 * 0.80665 = let me compute that.

First, 2057.9712 * 0.8 = 1,646.37696

2057.9712 * 0.00665 = let's compute that.

2057.9712 * 0.006 = 12.3478272

2057.9712 * 0.00065 = 1.33743128

Adding those two: 12.3478272 + 1.33743128 = 13.68525848.

So 0.80665 is 0.8 +0.00665, so 1,646.37696 +13.68525848 = 1,660.06222.

So total P = 18,521.7408 + 1,660.06222 = 20,181.803 Pa.

So P is approximately 20,181.803 Pascals.

Wait, but wait, wait a second. Because in the manometer, the pressure is the gauge pressure, right? Because one side is connected to the apparatus and the other is open to the atmosphere. So the pressure inside the apparatus is P = P_atm + P_manometer, or is it the other way around?

Wait, no, wait. The manometer measures the pressure difference between the apparatus and the atmosphere. So if the fluid is higher on the apparatus side, then the pressure in the apparatus is higher than atmospheric. But in this case, the manometer reading is 206.402 cm of water. So does that mean the apparatus pressure is higher than atmospheric by that amount? Or is the manometer open to the atmosphere, so the pressure is just the pressure due to the water column?

Wait, the manometer is a U-tube. One side is connected to the apparatus, the other is open. So the height difference (h) represents the pressure difference between the apparatus and the atmosphere. So if the apparatus pressure is higher, the fluid is lower on that side, so the height h is the difference. So in that case, the pressure P inside the apparatus is P_atm + (h * rho * g). But wait, wait, no. Because if the pressure in the apparatus is higher than atmospheric, the fluid level would be lower on the apparatus side. So the height h is the difference in levels. So the pressure P_apparatus = P_atm + (h * rho * g). But wait, in this problem, are we assuming atmospheric pressure? Or is the manometer measuring the absolute pressure?

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's given that the manometer is open to the atmosphere. So the pressure inside the apparatus is P = P_atm + (h * rho * g). But wait, wait, no. Because in a manometer open to the atmosphere, the pressure on the open side is atmospheric. So the pressure in the apparatus is P_app = P_atm + rho * g * h, where h is the height difference. But wait, another way: the pressure exerted by a column of fluid is rho * g * h. So if the fluid is higher on the open side, then the pressure in the apparatus is lower than atmospheric. So in this case, if the manometer reading is 206.402 cm, then P_app = P_atm - (rho * g * h). But wait, wait, the manometer could be indicating either overpressure or underpressure relative to atmosphere.

Wait, but in the problem statement, the pressure is 206.402 cm of water. I think that refers to the height of the water column, which corresponds to the pressure difference. So if the apparatus is at higher pressure, the water would be lower on the apparatus side, meaning the height corresponds to P_app = P_atm + (rho * g * h). Alternatively, if the pressure is lower, the water would be higher on the apparatus side, and P_app = P_atm - (rho * g * h). But without knowing which side is higher, perhaps we can assume that the pressure in the apparatus is P = h * rho * g above atmospheric pressure. Or perhaps the problem is considering absolute pressure, which would include atmospheric pressure. Hmm. Wait, but the problem gives only the manometer reading as 206 cm of water. So perhaps in this context, the pressure is the gauge pressure, which is the pressure above atmospheric. So P = rho * g * h. So in that case, P is 20,181.803 Pa. But wait, that's only the gauge pressure, not the absolute. So the absolute pressure would be P_abs = P_atm + P_gauge.

Wait, but the problem doesn't mention atmospheric pressure. Hmm. Let me think. In the ideal gas law, P must be absolute pressure. So if the manometer measures the gauge pressure (pressure above atmospheric), then the absolute pressure is P_abs = P_atm + P_gauge.

But in the problem, the manometer is open to the atmosphere, so the pressure measured is the gauge pressure. So we need to add atmospheric pressure to it to get the absolute pressure.

Wait, but the problem doesn't give the atmospheric pressure, which is usually around 101325 Pa. So perhaps I should include that.

Wait, but without knowing the atmospheric pressure, how can I proceed? Maybe the problem is intended to consider the manometer reading as the absolute pressure, but that wouldn't make sense because manometers typically measure gauge pressure.

Hmm, wait, maybe the problem states that the manometer's other side is open to the atmosphere, so the pressure in the apparatus is the atmospheric pressure plus the pressure from the water column. So P = P_atm + (h * rho * g). But since P_atm is about 101325 Pa, and the water column contributes around 20,181 Pa, the total P would be 101325 + 20181.8 = 121,506.8 Pa.

Wait, but in that case, the calculation would require knowing P_atm. But the problem doesn't provide it, so maybe I'm supposed to neglect it? Or perhaps the problem is considering the pressure as just the water column, without adding P_atm. That would be incorrect, but perhaps in the context of the problem, they are considering gauge pressure as the actual pressure. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the manometer is measuring the absolute pressure, but that's not how manometers work. Ugh, this is confusing. Let me think again. The manometer measures the pressure difference between the apparatus and the atmosphere. So the absolute pressure in the apparatus is P_app = P_atm + (h * rho * g). But without knowing P_atm, I can't compute the absolute pressure. So maybe the problem assumes that the manometer reading is the absolute pressure. But that can't be right because manometers are differential.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering that the manometer is filled with water, and the pressure due to 206 cm of water is the pressure in the apparatus. So in that case, P would be 20,181.8 Pa. Because maybe the setup is such that the other side is evacuated, but the problem says it's open to the atmosphere. So perhaps it's just the gauge pressure, and the problem expects me to use that as the pressure in the ideal gas law. But that would be wrong because ideal gas law requires absolute pressure.

Wait, but if I proceed with just the 20,181.8 Pa as P, then I can compute R, but I might get the wrong answer because I'm missing the atmospheric pressure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to ignore atmospheric pressure, treating the manometer reading as the absolute pressure. But I'm not sure.

Wait, looking back at the problem statement, it says: "the pressure inside the apparatus is then determined from the difference in heights of the liquid." So the pressure inside is P = P_atm + (h rho g). So I think that is the case. But without knowing P_atm, how can I calculate P?

Wait, perhaps the problem expects me to use only the manometer pressure as P, perhaps assuming that the atmospheric pressure is negligible or that the setup is such that the manometer measures absolute pressure. That seems unlikely, but perhaps that's what I have to do.

Alternatively, perhaps the pressure is measured as the absolute pressure because the manometer is sealed on one side. But the problem says it's a U-shaped tube with one side connected to the apparatus and the other open. So that's a standard manometer setup measuring gauge pressure.

I'm in a bit of a bind here. Without P_atm, I can't compute the absolute pressure. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps all the gas is in the container, so the pressure is P = h rho g. But that can't be, because the container is sealed except for the manometer. Wait, no, the container is connected to the manometer. So the pressure inside is higher than atmospheric by h rho g. So P = P_atm + h rho g.

But without P_atm, I can't find P. So perhaps the problem is assuming that the manometer reading is the absolute pressure, which would be incorrect, but maybe that's the approach intended.

Alternatively, perhaps in this context, the pressure is just the manometer reading in cm H2O, and I should convert that directly to Pascals without worrying about P_atm. Because perhaps the problem assumes that the manometer is measuring the absolute pressure, which would be the case if the other side is evacuated, but the problem says it's open to the atmosphere. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let's proceed with P = h rho g and see what R comes out to, then check the options.

So P is 20,181.803 Pa.

V is 0.02 m³.

n is 0.06283 mol.

T is 773.15 K.

So R = (P V) / (n T).

Plugging in the numbers:

P V = 20181.803 * 0.02 = 403.63606 Pa·m³.

n T = 0.06283 * 773.15 ≈ let's compute that.

0.06 * 773.15 = 46.389

0.00283 * 773.15 ≈ 2.190

So total nT ≈ 46.389 + 2.190 = 48.579.

So R = 403.63606 / 48.579 ≈ let's compute that.

403.636 / 48.579 ≈ approximately 8.31 something.

Wait, let me
