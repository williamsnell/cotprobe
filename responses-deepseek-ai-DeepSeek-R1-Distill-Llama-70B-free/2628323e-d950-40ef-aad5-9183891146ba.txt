Question:

A driver and passenger were driving to work in the former's automobile one morning. As they were traveling at a speed of 20 m. p. h. (which was within the posted speed limit), the passenger suddenly pointed to an overturned vehicle along the side of the highway and said, "Look at that car upside down. " The driver turned to look at the overturned vehicle. As he was looking toward the side of the road, the driver failed to see an abandoned vehicle with a flat tire in the highway about 200 feet in front of his approaching auto. Seconds later, the driver crashed into the rear of the abandoned auto and was injured. The jurisdiction has a relevant comparative negligence statute in effect. If the driver asserts a claim against the owner of the abandoned auto, the most likely result is that the driver will

Options:

A: recover nothing, because the passenger's act was a supervening cause.
B: recover only a portion of damages, because both the driver and the owner of the abandoned auto were negligent.
C: recover nothing, because he was distracted while driving.
D: recover all of his damages, because the owner of the abandoned auto was negligent.
E: recover only a portion of damages, because the abandoned auto was in plain view.
F: recover all of his damages, because the abandoned auto was a traffic hazard.
G: recover all of his damages, because the defendant created a dangerous condition.
H: recover nothing, because he was driving at a speed that didn't allow him to stop in time.
I: recover nothing, because he had the last clear chance to avoid the collision.

Okay, so I've got this question about tort law, specifically dealing with negligence and comparative fault. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: A driver and passenger are in a car going to work. They're driving at 20 mph, which is within the speed limit. The passenger points out an overturned car, and the driver looks. While he's looking, he doesn't see an abandoned car with a flat tire 200 feet ahead. He crashes into it and gets injured.

The question is about the driver's claim against the owner of the abandoned auto. The jurisdiction has a comparative negligence statute.

So, the possible defenses or factors here would involve negligence on both sides. Let's think about the elements of negligence: duty, breach, causation, and damages.

The driver's duty is to drive safely, follow traffic laws. He was within the speed limit, so that's good. However, he got distracted by the passenger's comment and looked away, which might be a breach of duty. Distracted driving is a common example of negligence.

The owner of the abandoned car: leaving a vehicle on the highway without a flat tire could be a hazard. So the owner might have been negligent for abandoning the car in a place where it could cause harm. That's a breach of their duty to not create hazards.

Now, causation. The driver's distraction caused him to not see the car, leading to the crash. The abandoned car being there was also a cause. So both actions are part of the cause-in-fact and the proximate cause.

Comparative negligence comes into play here. The jurisdiction uses a comparative negligence system, which can reduce the plaintiff's recovery by their percentage of fault. But wait, some jurisdictions use contributory negligence, but the question says it's comparative.

Wait, but in some comparative negligence systems, if the plaintiff is even 1% at fault, they can recover, just less. Other systems bar recovery if the plaintiff is more than 50% responsible.

In this case, the driver was distracted, which is his fault. The owner left the car on the road, which is their fault. So both are negligent.

So the driver's damages would be reduced by his percentage of fault. So he can't recover all, but can recover a portion.

Looking at the options:

Option B says he can recover only a portion because both were negligent. That fits.

Option D says he can recover all because the owner was negligent. But that ignores the driver's own negligence.

Option H says he recover nothing because speed didn't allow stopping, but speed was within limit. So H is about speed, but the issue is distraction, not speed.

Option C says recover nothing because he was distracted. But in comparative negligence, you don't recover nothing unless it's a contributory negligence state, which this isn't. So C is incorrect.

Option E says recover a portion because the auto was in plain view. But the driver didn't see it because he was distracted, so maybe that's a factor. But the key is both parties were negligent.

So the correct answer should be B.

The case involves a driver who crashes into an abandoned vehicle while distracted by a passenger pointing out another overturned car. The jurisdiction applies a comparative negligence statute, meaning the plaintiff's recovery is reduced by their percentage of fault if both parties are negligent.

The driver was operating within the speed limit but was distracted, which constitutes negligence. The owner of the abandoned vehicle was also negligent for leaving it on the highway, creating a hazard. Both parties' actions contributed to the accident, so comparative negligence applies.

Under comparative negligence, the driver can recover damages but only a portion, as his own negligence (distraction) contributed to the crash. Therefore, the correct answer is:

B: recover only a portion of damages, because both the driver and the owner of the abandoned auto were negligent.

Answer: B
