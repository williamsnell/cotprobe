Okay, so I've got this problem to find the arc length of a curve given by the parametric equations x = t, y = t², and z = (2/3)t³. The options are A through J, each with a different number. Hmm, I remember that the formula for the arc length of a parametric curve involves an integral.

Wait, right, the formula is the integral from a to b of the square root of (dx/dt)² + (dy/dt)² + (dz/dt)² dt. So I need to find the derivatives first.

Let's compute each derivative. dx/dt is straightforward; since x = t, dx/dt is 1. For y = t², dy/dt is 2t. And z is (2/3)t³, so dz/dt is 2t². 

So putting it all together, the integrand becomes sqrt[(1)^2 + (2t)^2 + (2t²)^2] dt. That simplifies to sqrt(1 + 4t² + 4t⁴) dt.

Hmm, now I need to figure out the limits of integration. The problem doesn't specify the range for t, which is a bit confusing. Oh wait, maybe it's implied that t goes from 0 to 1, or perhaps from 0 to 2? Wait, looking back at the problem, no, it just gives x, y, z in terms of t without specifying. I might have missed that part.

Wait, perhaps the question expects me to compute the arc length from t=0 to t=1, as that's a common default when limits aren't specified. Alternatively, maybe it's from t=0 to t=2. I'm a bit uncertain. Hmm.

Wait, let me think. If I look at the options, they are all around 5 to 9.5. So I should probably choose the correct limits. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to compute it for a general case and maybe a specific interval is given. Wait, no, the question is just to find the arc length without specifying the interval, which is confusing. Oh wait, perhaps the default is from t=0 to t=1. Let me proceed with that assumption.

So, the integral becomes ∫ from t=0 to t=1 of sqrt(1 + 4t² + 4t⁴) dt. Let me see if I can simplify the expression inside the square root. Let's factor it.

Looking at 4t⁴ +4t² +1. Hmm, does this factor into a square? Let's see: 4t⁴ is (2t²)^2, 4t² is 4t², and 1 is 1^2. Maybe (2t² + something)^2? Let me see: (2t² + a)^2 = 4t⁴ +4a t² + a². So if 4a t² is 4t², then a=1. And then a² would be 1. So (2t² + 1)^2 = 4t^4 +4t² +1, which matches exactly. Oh, that's a big help!

So the integrand becomes sqrt( (2t² +1)^2 ), which is just 2t² +1, since for t in real numbers, 2t² +1 is always positive. So the integral simplifies to ∫ from 0 to 1 of (2t² +1) dt.

That's much easier. Now integrating term by term: the integral of 2t² is (2/3)t³, and the integral of 1 is t. So evaluating from 0 to 1:

At t=1: (2/3)(1)^3 + (1) = 2/3 +1 = 5/3.
At t=0: All terms are zero, so the integral is 5/3 - 0 = 5/3.

Wait, but wait a second, 5/3 is approximately 1.666..., but the options are all around 5-9. So that can't be right. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the limits.

Wait, perhaps the limits are from t=0 to t=2 instead of t=0 to t=1. Let's try that. Let me redo the integral with the same function but from 0 to 2.

So ∫ from 0 to 2 of (2t² +1) dt. The antiderivative is (2/3)t³ + t.

At t=2: (2/3)(8) + 2 = 16/3 + 2 = 16/3 + 6/3 = 22/3 ≈7.333.
At t=0: 0. So the integral is 22/3, which is approximately 7.333.

Looking at the options, option G is 7.333. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait, but why did I initially think the limits were from 0 to 1? Oh, perhaps because the problem statement didn't specify, but the options suggest a higher value, so maybe the intended interval was t=0 to t=2. Alternatively, maybe I should check if perhaps the parameter t was intended to go from 0 to another value, but since the question doesn't specify, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the curve is being considered over a specific interval that's implied by the functions. Let me think again. Oh, wait, perhaps the z-component is given as (2/3)t^3, which suggests that maybe the parameter t is up to t=2, as that would make z=(2/3)(8)=16/3 ≈5.333. Hmm, but that's just z; perhaps not relevant.

Wait, another thought: the arc length formula is ∫sqrt( (dx/dt)^2 + (dy/dt)^2 + (dz/dt)^2 ) dt. I correctly found the derivatives: dx/dt=1, dy/dt=2t, dz/dt=2t². So the integrand is sqrt(1 + (2t)^2 + (2t^2)^2) = sqrt(1 +4t² +4t^4).

Then, I factored it into (2t² +1)^2, so sqrt becomes 2t² +1. So the integral is correct.

Now, if I integrate from 0 to 1, I get 5/3 ≈1.666, which isn't among the options. But when I integrate from 0 to 2, I get 22/3≈7.333, which is option G. So that must be the intended answer.

I think perhaps the problem expects the interval to be from t=0 to t=2, as that gives a value present in the options. So the correct answer would be G:7.333.

To find the arc length of the curve given by the parametric equations \(x = t\), \(y = t^2\), and \(z = \frac{2}{3}t^3\), we use the arc length formula for parametric curves:

\[
\text{Arc Length} = \int_{a}^{b} \sqrt{\left(\frac{dx}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{dz}{dt}\right)^2} \, dt
\]

First, compute the derivatives:
- \(\frac{dx}{dt} = 1\),
- \(\frac{dy}{dt} = 2t\),
- \(\frac{dz}{dt} = 2t^2\).

Substitute these into the formula:
\[
\text{Arc Length} = \int_{a}^{b} \sqrt{1^2 + (2t)^2 + (2t^2)^2} \, dt = \int_{a}^{b} \sqrt{1 + 4t^2 + 4t^4} \, dt.
\]

Simplify the integrand by recognizing that \(1 + 4t^2 + 4t^4 = (2t^2 + 1)^2\). Thus:
\[
\sqrt{1 + 4t^2 + 4t^4} = 2t^2 + 1.
\]

The integral becomes:
\[
\text{Arc Length} = \int_{a}^{b} (2t^2 + 1) \, dt.
\]

The problem does not specify the limits of integration, but the options suggest a range from \(t = 0\) to \(t = 2\). Evaluating the integral over this interval:
\[
\int_{0}^{2} (2t^2 + 1) \, dt = \left[\frac{2}{3}t^3 + t\right]_{0}^{2}.
\]

At \(t = 2\):
\[
\frac{2}{3}(2^3) + 2 = \frac{16}{3} + 2 = \frac{22}{3}.
\]

At \(t = 0\), the result is 0. Thus, the arc length is:
\[
\frac{22}{3} \approx 7.333.
\]

This matches option **G**. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**G: 7.333**
