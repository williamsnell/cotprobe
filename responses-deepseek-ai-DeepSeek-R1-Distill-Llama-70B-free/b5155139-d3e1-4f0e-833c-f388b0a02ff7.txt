Question:

Order the following (risk, return) pairs from least to most favourable, assuming the perspective of a rational and risk-averse investor: (2,2),(2,3) and (4,2). Risk is measured in standard deviations and return in percentage. HINT: Imagine a scatter diagram with standard deviation on the x-axis and return on the y-axis.

Options:

A: (2,3),(2,2),(4,2)
B: (4,2),(2,2),(4,2)
C: (2,2),(2,2),(4,2)
D: (2,2),(2,3),(4,2)
E: (2,2),(4,2),(2,3)
F: (4,2),(2,3),(2,2)
G: (4,2),(2,2),(2,3)
H: (2,3),(4,2),(2,2)
I: (2,2),(4,2),(2,2)

Okay, I need to figure out how to order these (risk, return) pairs from least to most favorable for a rational, risk-averse investor. The pairs given are (2,2), (2,3), and (4,2). 

First, I remember that a risk-averse investor prefers higher returns with lower risk. So, the ideal investment would have the highest return and the lowest risk. But since these are pairs, I'll have to compare each one.

Let me list them out:

1. (2,2): Risk is 2, return is 2%
2. (2,3): Risk is 2, return is 3%
3. (4,2): Risk is 4, return is 2%

Now, a rational and risk-averse investor would prioritize lower risk and higher returns. So I should compare each pair based on these two factors.

Starting with risk: Lower risk is better. So (2,2) and (2,3) both have lower risk (2) compared to (4,2) which has a higher risk (4). Between the two with same risk, the one with higher return is better. So between (2,2) and (2,3), (2,3) is better because 3% return is higher than 2%.

Now, looking at (4,2), it's riskier but only gives a 2% return, which is worse than (2,3) which has same risk as (2,2) but higher return.

So the order from least favorable to most favorable should be the one with the worst combination first, then better, then best.

Wait, wait. Let me think again. Least favorable would be the worst option. So which one is the worst?

(4,2) has high risk and low return. That's probably the worst because higher risk isn't compensated by higher return. So it's the least favorable.

Then, (2,2): moderate risk (but same as (2,3) but lower return than (2,3)). So (2,2) is worse than (2,3) because same risk but less return. So (2,2) is less favorable than (2,3).

So the order from least to most favorable is:

(4,2) → (2,2) → (2,3).

Wait, but the question says "from least to most favourable". So the first in the list should be the least favorable, and the last the most.

So the order is (4,2), then (2,2), then (2,3).

Wait, but looking at the answer choices, I should match this order.

Looking at the options:

Option G is (4,2), (2,2), (2,3). So that's the order I came up with.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Options are:

A: (2,3),(2,2),(4,2)
B: (4,2),(2,2),(4,2)
C: (2,2),(2,2),(4,2)
D: (2,2),(2,3),(4,2)
E: (2,2),(4,2),(2,3)
F: (4,2),(2,3),(2,2)
G: (4,2),(2,2),(2,3)
H: (2,3),(4,2),(2,2)
I: (2,2),(4,2),(2,2)

So option G is (4,2) as first, then (2,2), then (2,3). So that matches the order I thought: least favorable is (4,2), then (2,2), then (2,3) as most favorable.

So the correct answer is option G.

To determine the order of the (risk, return) pairs from least to most favorable for a rational and risk-averse investor, we analyze each pair based on the principles that lower risk and higher returns are preferred. The given pairs are:

1. **(2,2)**: Risk = 2, Return = 2%  
2. **(2,3)**: Risk = 2, Return = 3%  
3. **(4,2)**: Risk = 4, Return = 2%  

### Analysis:
- **(4,2)**: High risk (4) and low return (2%) make this the least favorable option.  
- **(2,2)**: Moderate risk (2) and low return (2%) make this less favorable than (2,3) but more favorable than (4,2).  
- **(2,3)**: Low risk (2) and high return (3%) make this the most favorable option.  

### Order from least to most favorable:
1. **(4,2)**  
2. **(2,2)**  
3. **(2,3)**  

### Matching with the options:
The correct order corresponds to **Option G**: (4,2), (2,2), (2,3).  

Answer: G
