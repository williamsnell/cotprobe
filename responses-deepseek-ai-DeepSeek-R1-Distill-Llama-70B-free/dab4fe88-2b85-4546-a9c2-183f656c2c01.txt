Okay, so I've got this question about ocean tides and when the highest ones occur. Hmm, I remember that tides have something to do with the gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun on Earth's oceans. Let me think.

Wait, the tides are caused mainly by the Moon because it's closer to Earth. But when the Sun and Moon are aligned, their gravitational forces work together, right? That would create even higher high tides and lower low tides. Oh, right, those are called spring tides. And when they're at right angles, you get neap tides, which are less pronounced.

So the question is about the highest tides. That happens during spring tides, which occur when the Sun, Moon, and Earth are in a straight line. So the Moon and Earth must be lined up with the Sun. Wait, but the options are about Earth and Moon's position relative to the Sun. Or maybe it's about their alignment.

Looking at the options:

Option H says "lined up with the Sun." So when Earth and Moon are lined up with the Sun, that's when you get the maximum tides. So that's probably the correct answer.

Wait, but another thought: the highest tides also occur when the Moon is at perigee (closest to Earth), but the question doesn't mention that. It's more about the alignment, I think.

So the correct answer should be H. Yeah, because when they're aligned, the combined gravitational pull is strongest, leading to the highest tides.

The highest ocean tides occur due to the gravitational interaction between the Earth, Moon, and Sun. When the Earth, Moon, and Sun are aligned, their gravitational forces work together, creating the highest high tides and the lowest low tides, known as spring tides. This alignment happens when the Earth and Moon are "lined up with the Sun." Therefore, the correct answer is:

H: lined up with the Sun.

Answer: H
