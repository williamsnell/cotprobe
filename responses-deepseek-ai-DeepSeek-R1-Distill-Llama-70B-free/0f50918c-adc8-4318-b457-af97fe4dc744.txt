Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this psychology question here. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The question is about an employee who expects more consistency in his boss's behavior than what's actually there. And we need to pick which psychological concept explains this expectation.

Hmm, the options are A through I, each a different theory or bias. Let me go through them one by one and think about what each means.

Option A is cognitive dissonance theory. I remember that cognitive dissonance is about the discomfort people feel when they hold conflicting thoughts, beliefs, or values. They try to reduce this discomfort by changing one of their cognitions or by justifying the behavior. But how does this relate to expecting consistency in someone else's behavior? Maybe not directly. The employee isn't necessarily experiencing conflicting thoughts himself, but rather expecting the boss to be consistent. So maybe not A.

Option B is self-serving bias. This is when people attribute their successes to themselves and their failures to external factors. For example, if I do well on a test, I think I'm smart, but if I fail, I might blame the teacher. But the question is about the boss's behavior consistency. Doesn't seem to fit here because it's about the employee's expectations, not how the employee attributes things to themselves.

Option C is self-verification theory. I think this has to do with people seeking information that confirms their existing self-concepts. So, they look for consistency in how others see them because it reinforces their own self-view. Wait, but the question is about the employee expecting consistency in the boss's behavior, not about the employee's self-concept. Hmm, maybe not C.

Option D is social comparison theory. This is about how people evaluate themselves by comparing to others. Like, we judge our own abilities or status by looking at others. But again, the question is about expecting consistency in another person's behavior, not about self-evaluation through comparison. So probably not D.

Option E is fundamental attribution bias. Oh right, this is the tendency to overestimate the role of personality and underestimate the impact of situational factors when judging others' behavior. So when someone does something, we think it's because of who they are, not because of the situation. How does this apply here? If the employee expects the boss to be consistent, maybe he's assuming the boss's behavior is due to his personality, not considering that the boss's actions might vary based on different situations. So the employee is expecting consistency because he attributes the boss's behavior to his character, not the situation. That sounds plausible. So E could be the right answer.

Option F is actor-observer bias. This is where people attribute their own behavior to situational factors but others' behavior to their character. For example, "I failed the test because it was hard" (situational), but "He failed because he's not smart" (dispositional). But again, the question is about expecting consistency, not about how we attribute specific behaviors. So maybe not F.

Option G is hindsight bias. That's when, after an event, people think they would have predicted it. Like saying "I knew that would happen" even if they didn't. Not related to expecting consistency in behavior, so probably not G.

Option H is overjustification hypothesis. This suggests that when people are rewarded for doing something they already enjoy, they might lose intrinsic motivation because they start to think they're doing it for the reward, not because they like it. Doesn't seem relevant to the question here.

Option I is self-perception theory. This posits that people develop their attitudes by observing their own behavior and then inferring their attitudes from that. For example, if I donate to charity, I might think I'm a generous person. Again, this seems more about the self, not about expecting others to be consistent.

Wait, so going back, the question is about the employee expecting the boss to behave consistently. That is, the employee believes the boss's behavior will follow certain patterns without much variation. Which concept explains that expectation? 

Fundamental attribution bias (E) causes people to see others' behavior as consistent with their character, ignoring situational factors. So if the boss sometimes acts one way and sometimes another, the employee, due to FAB, might still expect the boss to behave consistently because he attributes the behavior to the boss's personality. That makes sense. 

Alternatively, another thought: could it be related to schemas or something like that? Schemas are mental frameworks that help us organize and interpret information. If the employee has a certain schema about the boss, he might expect the boss's behavior to fit into that schema, leading him to expect consistency. But the options don't include schema theory. So among the options given, E seems the best fit.

The question involves an employee who expects greater consistency in his boss's behavior than is warranted, and the task is to identify which psychological concept best explains this expectation. Let's analyze the options:

- **A: Cognitive Dissonance Theory**: This relates to the discomfort people feel when holding conflicting thoughts or beliefs. It does not directly explain the expectation of consistency in someone else's behavior.  
- **B: Self-Serving Bias**: This involves attributing successes to oneself and failures to external factors. It is about self-attribution and does not explain expectations about others' behavior.  
- **C: Self-Verification Theory**: This is about seeking information that confirms one's self-concept. It focuses on self-perception rather than expectations about others' behavior.  
- **D: Social Comparison Theory**: This involves evaluating oneself by comparing to others. It is about self-evaluation, not about expecting consistency in others' behavior.  
- **E: Fundamental Attribution Bias**: This is the tendency to overestimate the role of personality and underestimate situational factors when judging others' behavior. The employee's expectation of consistency in the boss's behavior aligns with this bias, as it reflects attributing the boss's behavior to his character rather than to situational factors.  
- **F: Actor-Observer Bias**: This involves attributing one's own behavior to situational factors and others' behavior to their character. While related to attribution, it does not specifically address expectations of consistency.  
- **G: Hindsight Bias**: This involves believing, after an event, that one would have predicted it. It is unrelated to expectations of consistency in behavior.  
- **H: Overjustification Hypothesis**: This suggests that rewards can undermine intrinsic motivation. It is not relevant to the question.  
- **I: Self-Perception Theory**: This is about inferring one's attitudes from one's behavior. It focuses on self-perception rather than expectations about others.  

The best explanation is **E: Fundamental Attribution Bias**, as it accounts for the employee's expectation of consistency in the boss's behavior by attributing it to the boss's personality rather than situational factors.
