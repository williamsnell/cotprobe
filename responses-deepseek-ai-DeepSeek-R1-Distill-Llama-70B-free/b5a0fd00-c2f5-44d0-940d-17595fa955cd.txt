Okay, so I've got this problem here: I need to find the number of labeled rooted forests on 6 vertices. The options are A through J, with various numbers. Hmm, I remember something about rooted forests from my graph theory class, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think this through step by step.

First off, what's a rooted forest? Well, a forest is an acyclic graph, which means it's a collection of trees. A rooted forest is just a forest where each tree has a designated root vertex. So each component of the forest is a rooted tree. Got it.

Now, the question is about labeled vertices. That means each vertex is distinct, so the labels matter. So we're counting all possible labeled rooted forests with 6 vertices.

I recall there's a formula related to rooted forests, maybe from Cayley's work. Cayley's formula gives the number of labeled trees on n vertices as n^(n-2). But wait, that's just for trees, not forests. Oh right, forests can have multiple trees.

Wait, what's the general approach for counting rooted forests? I think the number of rooted forests on n labeled vertices is (n+1)^(n-1). Or was it something else? Hmm, maybe that's for something else. Alternatively, I remember that for rooted forests, each vertex has a parent, except the roots. So maybe it's related to the number of mappings from the set of vertices to themselves with certain properties.

Oh right! There's a concept called endofunctions or mappings where each element maps to another. For rooted forests, each vertex except the roots has exactly one parent, forming an in-forest (each node has in-degree 1 except the roots which have 0). So the number of such functions where each element points to another, forming a forest of rooted trees, is given by some formula.

Wait, the number of rooted forests on n labeled vertices is n^(n-2) multiplied by something? Or maybe it's a different formula altogether. Let's think about it differently.

I remember that for each rooted forest, the structure can be determined by choosing a root for each tree and then arranging the other nodes as children. But how does that translate into a count?

Another approach: Each labeled rooted forest corresponds to a functional graph. A functional graph is a directed graph where each node has out-degree exactly 1, which forms a collection of trees directed towards the roots, along with cycles. But wait, no—since it's a forest, there can't be any cycles. So the functional graph in this case must be a forest, meaning all components are trees (i.e., no cycles). So the number of such functions where the functional graph is a forest is equal to the number of rooted forests.

But how do we count that? I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for a recurrence relation or an exponential generating function. Alternatively, perhaps there's a direct formula.

Wait, I found in my notes that the number of rooted forests on n labeled vertices is equal to (n)^(n-2) * something. No, wait, Cayley's formula for trees is n^(n-2), which counts the number of labeled trees on n vertices. But for forests, it's more complicated.

Alternatively, I think the number of rooted forests on n vertices is given by the sum over k from 1 to n of the number of ways to partition the vertices into k non-empty subsets, each being a tree, and each tree has a root. Each such subset contributes a rooted tree. So the total number would be the sum for k=1 to n of (number of ways to partition into k subsets) multiplied by (product over each subset of the number of rooted trees on that subset).

But calculating that directly for n=6 seems complicated. Maybe there's a generating function or a formula that can simplify this.

Wait, another thought: The number of rooted forests on n labeled vertices is (n+1)^(n-1). Let me check this. For example, when n=1, it's (2)^0 =1, which makes sense because there's only one forest—a single root. For n=2, (3)^(1)=3. Let's see: possible forests are either two single-root trees (each vertex is its own root) or one tree with two vertices, which can be rooted in two ways (each being the root). Wait, no—if it's a single tree with two vertices, there are two possibilities depending on which is the root. So for n=2, the total is 3, which matches (2+1)^(2-1)=3. So the formula seems to hold for n=2.

Another check: n=3. (4)^(2)=16. Let's compute manually. The possible rooted forests are:

- All three as single-root trees: 1 way (since each is its own root)
- Two single roots and one tree of two: The pair can be combined in C(3,2)=3 ways. For each pair, the two-vertex tree can have either root, so 3 * 2 =6.
- One single root and one tree of three: The single root can be any of the three. For each choice, the three-vertex tree can be rooted in 3 ways (each vertex as root). So 3 * 3=9.
Wait, but wait. Alternatively, the three-vertex tree is just counted as 3 possibilities (each as root), and multiplied by the number of ways to choose which vertex is the single root. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the counting.

Alternatively, when n=3, the number of rooted forests is 16. So according to the formula, (3+1)^(3-1) =4^2=16. So it matches.

So the formula seems to be (n+1)^(n-1). So for n=6, the number of rooted forests would be (6+1)^(6-1) =7^5=16807.

Looking back at the options, option D is 16807. So that should be the correct answer.

To determine the number of labeled rooted forests on 6 vertices, we start by understanding that a rooted forest is a collection of rooted trees. Each vertex in the forest is distinct (labeled), and the problem requires counting all possible such structures.

The key insight is that the number of labeled rooted forests on \( n \) vertices is given by the formula:

\[
(n+1)^{n-1}
\]

This formula is derived from the relationship between rooted forests and functional graphs, where each vertex has exactly one parent except for the roots. For \( n = 6 \), substituting into the formula gives:

\[
(6+1)^{6-1} = 7^5
\]

Calculating \( 7^5 \):

\[
7^5 = 7 \times 7 \times 7 \times 7 \times 7 = 16807
\]

Thus, the number of labeled rooted forests on 6 vertices is 16,807. Comparing this result with the provided options, the correct answer is:

**D: 16807**
