Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an electron in a capacitor. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the question says there's a sinusoidal voltage applied to a parallel plate capacitor. The plates are 2 cm apart, so that's 0.02 meters. The voltage has a frequency of 1 MHz, which is 1e6 Hz, and a peak value of 10 volts. An electron is released from one plate when the voltage is zero, and it's moving with an initial velocity of 1e6 m/s in the x-direction, which is perpendicular to the plates. There's no magnetic field, so I don't have to worry about that.

Wait, the electron is moving in the x-direction, which is perpendicular to the capacitor plates. So the plates are probably arranged along the y-axis, and the electric field is in the y-direction. So the electron's motion in x is unaffected by the electric field since E is in y. Or wait, no, the electric field would affect the electron's motion in the y-direction, but the initial velocity is in x. So maybe the electron's movement in x is uniform motion (constant velocity) and in y it's oscillatory due to the electric field.

But wait, the question is about the position in the x-direction? Or overall position? Hmm, the question states the initial velocity is in the x-direction, and the plates are 2 cm apart—so I think the electron is moving between the plates, so in the y-direction. Wait, no, the initial velocity is perpendicular to the plates. So if the plates are along the y-axis, then the x-direction is perpendicular. So the electron is moving in x, away from the plate, but the electric field is between the plates, which affects the y-direction.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me visualize this. Let's say the plates are vertical, separated along the y-axis, so the electric field is in the y-direction. The electron is released from one plate (say, at y=0) and starts moving in the x-direction with some velocity. But the electric field is in the y-direction, so it exerts a force on the electron in the y-direction. So the electron's motion in y is affected by the electric field, while in x it just moves at a constant velocity.

But the question asks for the position of the electron at any time t. So the position will have components in both x and y. But looking at the answer options, all the options are in terms of meters, and only a single function, so maybe they're considering the y-component? Or perhaps they're combining both?

Hmm, but the options are all in terms of t, with a term that's linear in t and another sinusoidal. So perhaps the motion in x is the linear term, and the motion in y is the sinusoidal term.

Wait, let me think again. The electric field is varying sinusoidally because the voltage is sinusoidal. So the force on the electron in the y-direction depends on the electric field, which varies with time.

The voltage is V(t) = V_peak * sin(2πft + φ). Wait, but the problem says the voltage is zero when the electron is released. So at t=0, V(0)=0. So if it's a sine function, that would be V(t) = 10 sin(2π(1e6)t + 0), because sin(0)=0. Alternatively, if it's a cosine function shifted by π/2, but let's go with sine for now.

The electric field E(t) in a capacitor is related to the voltage by E = V(t)/d, where d is the separation between the plates. So E(t) = (10 sin(2πe6 t)) / 0.02.

Wait, because d is 0.02 m. So E(t) = (10 V) / 0.02 m = 500 V/m * sin(2πe6 t). So E(t) = 500 sin(2πe6 t) V/m.

The force on the electron is F = eE(t), where e is the charge. So F(t) = e * 500 sin(2πe6 t) N. Then, using F = ma, the acceleration a(t) is F/m_e, where m_e is the electron mass.

So a(t) = (e * 500 sin(...)) / m_e.

Wait, but this is a time-varying acceleration, so the motion in the y-direction would be some sort of oscillatory motion. Let's model this.

The equation of motion in y is: m_e * d²y/dt² = -e E(t). Wait, because the electric field is in the y-direction and the force is F = -e E (since electron is negative).

Wait, no, the electric field E is in the direction from the positive to the negative plate. So if the electron is on the negative plate, the E field points towards the positive plate. So the force on the electron is F = -e E, because the field exerts a force in the opposite direction.

Wait, no, E is the electric field, which is the force per unit charge on a positive charge. So for an electron, F = -e E. So yes, the force is opposite to E.

So in the y-direction, the equation is:

d²y/dt² = ( -e E(t) ) / m_e

E(t) is 500 sin(2πe6 t), so:

d²y/dt² = (-e * 500 sin(2πe6 t)) / m_e

This is a second-order differential equation. The solution will involve integrating twice. Let's find the general solution.

The homogeneous solution is y_h = A t + B. The particular solution for a sine function can be found by assuming a solution of the form Y_p = C sin(ω t + φ), where ω is 2πe6.

Plugging into the equation:

-ω² Y_p = (-e *500 / m_e) sin(ω t)

So:

-ω² C sin(ω t + φ) = (-e *500 / m_e) sin(ω t)

Wait, maybe I should take derivatives.

Wait, the differential equation is:

y'' = [ (-e *500 ) / m_e ] sin(ω t )

So the particular solution would involve integrating this.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to use the method of undetermined coefficients. Let me let Y_p = C sin(ω t) + D cos(ω t).

Then Y_p'' = -ω² C sin(ω t) - ω² D cos(ω t).

Substituting into the equation:

-ω² [ C sin(ω t) + D cos(ω t) ] = [ (-e *500 ) / m_e ] sin(ω t )

Equate coefficients:

For sin(ω t): -ω² C = (-e *500 ) / m_e → C = (e *500) / (ω² m_e )

For cos(ω t): -ω² D = 0 → D=0.

So Y_p = (e *500)/(ω² m_e ) sin(ω t )

So the general solution is:

y(t) = A t + B + Y_p

But wait, the homogeneous solution is y_h = A t + B, but when we have a particular solution, the full solution is y(t) = y_h + Y_p.

Wait, no, wait, the equation is nonhomogeneous, so the general solution is y(t) = y_h + Y_p.

Wait, but in the equation, the right-hand side is just a function of sin(ω t), so Y_p is the particular solution I found.

So y(t) = A t + B + [ (e *500)/(ω² m_e ) ] sin(ω t )

Now, applying initial conditions.

At t=0, the electron is released from y=0 (assuming the plate is at y=0). So y(0) = 0.

So substituting t=0:

0 = A*0 + B + [ (e *500)/(ω² m_e ) ] * 0 → B = 0.

So y(t) = A t + [ (e *500 )/( ω² m_e ) ] sin(ω t )

Now, the initial velocity in the y-direction. Wait, the initial velocity given is in the x-direction, which is 1e6 m/s. So the initial y-velocity is zero? Because the electron is moving in x, so dy/dt at t=0 is zero.

So dy/dt = A + [ (e *500 )/( ω² m_e ) ] * ω cos(ω t )

At t=0, dy/dt = 0 → A + [ (e *500 ω )/( ω² m_e ) ) ] * 1 = 0 → A + (e *500 )/( ω m_e ) ) = 0 → A = - (e *500 )/( ω m_e )

So putting it all together:

y(t) = [ - (e *500 )/( ω m_e ) ) ] t + [ (e *500 )/( ω² m_e ) ) ] sin(ω t )

Hmm, that's the y-component of the motion.

Wait, but let me compute the constants. Let me plug in the numbers.

e = 1.6e-19 C.

m_e = 9.1e-31 kg.

ω = 2π * 1e6 = 2e6 π rad/s.

Compute the terms:

First term coefficient: (e *500 )/( ω m_e )

Let me compute this.

e *500 = 1.6e-19 *500 = 8e-17 C·m⁻¹·s²? Wait, units: e is in coulombs, 500 is V/m, so e*500 is (C)(V/m) = (J/C)(C)/m = J/m. Hmm, but maybe I should just compute the numerical values.

But let's compute the coefficient:

(e *500 )/( ω m_e ) = (1.6e-19 C * 500 V/m ) / ( 2e6 π rad/s * 9.1e-31 kg )

Wait, V = J/C, so 500 V/m = 500 J/(C·m). So numerator is (1.6e-19 C) * (500 J/(C·m)) ) = 1.6e-19 *500 / (C m) * C → 8e-17 J/m.

Denominator: ω m_e = 2e6 π * 9.1e-31 ≈ (2 *3.1416e6) *9.1e-31 → ≈ 5.83e6 *9.1e-31 ≈ 5.3e-24 kg·rad/s.

So the coefficient is (8e-17 J/m) / (5.3e-24 kg·rad/s ) → J is kg m²/s², so J/m is kg m/s².

So (kg m/s²) / (kg rad/s ) → (m/s²) / (rad/s ) → m/(s²) * s/(rad) ) → m/(s rad). Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on units here, perhaps I should just compute the numerical value.

Calculating (1.6e-19 *500 ) / ( 2e6 * π * 9.1e-31 )

Compute numerator: 1.6e-19 *500 = 8e-17.

Denominator: 2e6 * π ≈6.283e6 ; 6.283e6 *9.1e-31 ≈ 5.71e-24.

So the coefficient is 8e-17 /5.71e-24 ≈ (8/5.71) * 1e7 → approx 1.4 *1e7 → 1.4e7 m/(s^2 * s) ? Hmm, perhaps I should check.

Wait, no, the units for (e*500)/(ω m_e ) would be (C·V/m)/(rad/s·kg) → but V is J/C → so C*(J/(C m))/(rad/s * kg) ) → (J/m)/(kg rad/s) ) → (kg m²/s² / m ) / (kg rad/s) ) → (kg m/s²) / (kg rad/s) → (m/s²) / (rad/s) → m/(s rad) ??? Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake in unit analysis.

But perhaps I should proceed numerically.

So 8e-17 /5.71e-24 ≈ 1.4e7 m/s²? Hmm, wait, 8e-17 /5.71e-24 = (8 /5.71 ) * 1e7 ≈ 1.4 *1e7 = 1.4e7.

So the first term is -1.4e7 * t.

The second term is (e *500 )/( ω² m_e ) * sin(ω t )

Compute that coefficient:

(e *500 )/( ω² m_e ) = (1.6e-19 *500) / ( (2e6 π)^2 *9.1e-31 )

Numerator: 8e-17 as before.

Denominator: (2e6 π)^2 → (4e12 π² ) → approx 4e12 *9.87 → ~4e13.

So denominator is 4e13 *9.1e-31 = 3.64e-17.

So 8e-17 /3.64e-17 ≈ 2.197 ≈ ~2.2.

So the second term is approximately 2.2 sin(2πe6 t )

Putting it all together, y(t) = (-1.4e7) t + 2.2 sin(2πe6 t )

Wait, but wait. The initial condition for velocity: when I took the derivative dy/dt = A + (e 500 ω cos(ω t )) / (ω² m_e )

Wait, let's double-check that.

From y(t) = (-e 500/(ω m_e )) t + (e 500/(ω² m_e )) sin(ω t )

So dy/dt = (-e 500/(ω m_e )) + (e 500/(ω² m_e )) ω cos(ω t )

Simplify: (-e 500)/(ω m_e ) + (e 500 / (ω m_e )) cos(ω t )

At t=0, cos(0)=1, so dy/dt(0) = (-e500/(ω m_e )) + (e500/(ω m_e )) = 0, which matches the initial condition.

So that's correct.

Now, the y(t) is the vertical position between the plates, which are 2 cm apart. But the electron's initial position is at y=0, and the other plate is at y=0.02 m. So if the electron's y-position exceeds 0.02 m, it would be outside the capacitor, but given the time scales, perhaps it doesn't get that far in the time frame considered.

But the other part of the motion is the x-direction. The initial velocity in x is 1e6 m/s, and since there's no electric field in x, the motion in x is uniform. So x(t) = vx_initial * t = 1e6 t.

So the position as a function of time is given by both x and y components. But looking at the answer options, each option is a single function, which suggests that perhaps the problem is considering the displacement in the y-direction, but that doesn't make sense because the options have terms like 1.5e7 t, which is way larger than the plate separation.

Wait, wait, the options are all in meters, and the coefficients are on the order of 1e6 to 1e7. The initial velocity in x is 1e6 m/s, so after 1 microsecond (1e-6 s), x would be 1 m. But the plate separation is 2 cm, which is small. So perhaps the question is looking for the x-position as a function of time, but that would just be 1e6 t, but none of the options have just that.

Wait, looking at the options, all of them have a term that's linear in t (like 1.5e6 t) and a sinusoidal term. So perhaps the position being referred to is in the y-direction, but how can that be, since the y-term is (-1.4e7 t) + 2.2 sin(...)?

Wait, that can't be right because the velocity in y is oscillating, but with a linear term. Let me check my calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the equation of motion. Let me re-express the problem.

The electric field is E(t) = (V(t))/d, where V(t) = 10 sin(2πe6 t). So E(t) = (10 sin(2πe6 t)) / 0.02 = 500 sin(2πe6 t) V/m.

The force on the electron is F = -e E(t), because the electron's charge is negative. So F(t) = -e * E(t) = -1.6e-19 C *500 sin(2πe6 t) N.

So the equation of motion is m_e a(t) = F(t), so a(t) = F(t)/m_e = (-1.6e-19 *500 )/(9.1e-31) sin(2πe6 t) m/s².

Calculate that coefficient: (1.6e-19 *500 ) = 8e-17; 8e-17 /9.1e-31 ≈ 8.79e13 m/s². So a(t) = -8.79e13 sin(2πe6 t) m/s².

Hmm, that's a huge acceleration. But let me proceed.

So the position in y(t) is the integral of the integral of a(t). Let me set up the integrals.

a(t) = dv/dt = -K sin(ω t), where K = 8.79e13, ω=2πe6.

Integrate a(t) to get v(t):

v(t) = ∫ a(t) dt = ∫ -K sin(ω t) dt = (K / ω) cos(ω t) + C.

At t=0, v(0)=0, so 0 = (K/ω) cos(0) + C → C = -K/ω.

So v(t) = (K/ω) [cos(ω t) -1 ].

Then, integrate v(t) to get y(t):

y(t) = ∫ v(t) dt = ∫ (K
