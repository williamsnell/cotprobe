Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Hermitian operators. Hmm, I remember that Hermitian operators are important in quantum mechanics because their eigenvalues are real, which correspond to observable quantities. But wait, what exactly makes an operator Hermitian?

Oh right, an operator is Hermitian if it's equal to its own adjoint. The adjoint of an operator involves taking the complex conjugate transpose, but for differential operators, it's a bit more involved. I think for differential operators, the adjoint depends on the boundary conditions and the functions they're acting on.

The question gives three operators: d/dx, i d/dx, and d²/dx². I need to check which of these are Hermitian.

Let me start with the first one, a = d/dx. To find if it's Hermitian, I should compute its adjoint. The adjoint of d/dx would involve integration by parts. I think the adjoint of d/dx is -d/dx because when you integrate by parts, you get a negative sign. So (d/dx)† = -d/dx. Since a isn't equal to its adjoint, a isn't Hermitian. So option C, which says only a is Hermitian, is out.

Next, b = i d/dx. Let's find its adjoint. The adjoint of i d/dx would be (i d/dx)†. Since the adjoint of d/dx is -d/dx, and the adjoint of i (a scalar) is its complex conjugate, which is -i. So putting it together, (i d/dx)† = (-i)(-d/dx) = i d/dx. Wait, does that simplify correctly? Let me double-check. The adjoint of an operator O is such that <f|O† g> = <O f|g>. So for O = i d/dx, O† would be (i d/dx)†. Since i is imaginary, its conjugate is -i. And the derivative's adjoint is negative, so O† = (-i)(-d/dx) = i d/dx. Oh, so that makes O† equal to O. Therefore, b is Hermitian.

Now the third operator, c = d²/dx². Let's find its adjoint. The second derivative's adjoint would be the same as the second derivative because the two negatives would cancel out. Let me think about integration by parts. The adjoint of d²/dx² would be d²/dx² again because when you take the adjoint twice, the signs cancel. So (d²/dx²)† = d²/dx². That means c is equal to its adjoint, so it's Hermitian.

Wait, but earlier I thought a wasn't Hermitian, but both b and c are. So looking back at the options, option B says b and c are Hermitian, which matches what I found. Option D says all are, but since a isn't, D is wrong. Option A says none, which is wrong because b and c are. So the correct answer must be option B.

Wait, but wait another thing. I remember that for the Laplacian (which is similar to the second derivative in 1D), the operator is Hermitian under certain boundary conditions, like when the functions vanish at infinity or have periodic conditions. But generally, without specific boundary conditions, is d²/dx² Hermitian? I think in the standard case, assuming proper boundary conditions, yes, it is Hermitian. So I think my earlier conclusion holds.

To determine which of the given operators are Hermitian, we analyze each one:

1. **Operator \( a = \frac{d}{dx} \):**  
   The adjoint of \( \frac{d}{dx} \) is \( -\frac{d}{dx} \), as integration by parts introduces a negative sign. Since \( a \neq a^\dagger \), \( a \) is not Hermitian.

2. **Operator \( b = i\frac{d}{dx} \):**  
   The adjoint of \( i\frac{d}{dx} \) is computed as \( (i\frac{d}{dx})^\dagger = (-i)(-\frac{d}{dx}) = i\frac{d}{dx} \). Thus, \( b = b^\dagger \), making \( b \) Hermitian.

3. **Operator \( c = \frac{d^2}{dx^2} \):**  
   The adjoint of \( \frac{d^2}{dx^2} \) is \( \frac{d^2}{dx^2} \), as the second derivative is symmetric under integration by parts. Therefore, \( c = c^\dagger \), and \( c \) is Hermitian.

From this analysis:  
- \( a \) is not Hermitian.  
- \( b \) and \( c \) are Hermitian.  

The correct answer is **B: b and c are Hermitian**.
