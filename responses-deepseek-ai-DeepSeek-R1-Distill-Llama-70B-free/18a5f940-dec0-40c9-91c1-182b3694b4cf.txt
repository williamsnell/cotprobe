Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me read it again carefully.

The question is about the principal effect of current concerns to improve employment opportunities for the educationally or socially disadvantaged. It's asking what these concerns have encouraged in employment testing.

The options are A through H, each suggesting different types of tests. I need to think about what each option means and how it relates to the issue.

First, I should understand the context. The concern is about helping people who are disadvantaged educationally or socially. So, the goal here is probably to make employment testing fairer for them. These groups might not have had the same opportunities in education, so traditional tests might be biased against them.

Now, looking at the options:

A: Intelligence quotient tests. IQ tests are often criticized for cultural bias. They might not accurately reflect a person's ability to do a job, especially for those from different educational backgrounds. So maybe these are being discouraged.

B: Norm-referenced tests. These compare a person's score to a norm group. If the norm group isn't diverse, these tests could also be biased against disadvantaged groups.

C: Tests that assess physical abilities. Some jobs require physical strength or dexterity, but I'm not sure how this relates to educational or social disadvantages. Maybe not the main issue here.

D: Work-sample types of tests. Work samples are tests that simulate the actual job tasks. They show whether a person can perform the specific job requirements. This seems fair because it's directly related to the job, regardless of education.

E: Timed tests of a narrow range of abilities. Timed tests can be problematic if they favor those who are better at taking tests quickly, which might not reflect real job skills. Narrow abilities might not capture the full range of skills someone has.

F: Personality assessment tests. These might not be directly relevant to job performance and could have biases as well.

G: Tests based solely on academic performance. This could be unfair because educationally disadvantaged people might not have the same academic background, even if they can do the job.

H: Tests based on social skills. Social skills are important, but again, this might be biased against those from different social backgrounds.

So, the idea is that the concern is to make employment testing fairer. Using work-sample tests (D) would allow employers to see if someone can actually do the job, regardless of their education or social background. It's more about demonstrating actual skills relevant to the job.

I think the answer is D because work-sample tests are more directly tied to job performance and can reduce bias related to education or social background.

The principal effect of current concerns to improve employment opportunities for the educationally or socially disadvantaged has been to encourage the use of work-sample types of tests in employment testing. These tests assess a candidate's ability to perform specific job tasks, making the evaluation fairer and more relevant to actual job requirements, irrespective of educational or social background.

Answer: D
