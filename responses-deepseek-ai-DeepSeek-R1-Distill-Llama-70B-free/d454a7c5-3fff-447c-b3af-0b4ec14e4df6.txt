The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Company A has found that if it offers a guarantee on its transistor radios, more will be sold than without the guarantee. In a year, the company expects to sell 100 radios if no guarantee is offered, but if the length of the guarantee is t years then the number sold will be Q = 100 + 5t. It is known that 10% of radios sold will fail each year. The cost of fixing a radio is $1 and a profit of $2.80 is made on every radio sold. What is the length of the guarantee period t that maximizes profit?

Options:

A: 2 years
B: 3 years
C: 6 years
D: 4 years
E: 8 years
F: 10 years
G: 9 years
H: 7 years
I: 1 year
J: 5 years

Okay, so I've got this problem here about Company A and their transistor radios. They're trying to figure out the best guarantee period to maximize their profit. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

Alright, the problem says that without a guarantee, they sell 100 radios a year. But if they offer a guarantee for t years, the number sold increases to Q = 100 + 5t. So the more years they offer the guarantee, the more radios they sell. That makes sense because a longer guarantee probably makes customers feel more confident in their purchase.

Now, I need to think about the costs involved. It says that 10% of the radios sold will fail each year. So each year, for every radio sold, there's a 10% chance it'll need fixing. The cost to fix each radio is $1. Also, the company makes a profit of $2.80 per radio sold.

Wait, so the total profit would be the profit from selling the radios minus the cost of fixing the ones that fail. But I need to calculate this over the guarantee period. Oh right, because the longer the guarantee, the more potential years they might have to fix radios each year.

Let me try to model this. The number of radios sold in a year is Q = 100 +5t. But wait, t is the guarantee period. So if the guarantee is t years, each radio sold this year could fail in each of those t years, right? Or does the failure rate apply each year after the sale?

Wait, maybe I should think about it this way: For each radio sold, the company will have to cover repairs for t years. Each year, 10% of the radios sold will fail. So for each radio, the expected number of failures over t years is 0.10 * t, because each year there's a 10% chance.

But wait, no, that's not quite right. Because 10% fail each year, so over t years, the probability that a radio fails at least once is... Hmm, wait, no. Actually, each year it's a 10% chance, so the expected number of failures per radio is 0.10 * t. Because each year, regardless of previous failures, there's a 10% chance of failure. So for t years, on average, 0.10*t failures per radio. So the expected repair cost per radio sold is $1 multiplied by 0.10*t, which is 0.10*t dollars.

So for each radio, the cost is 0.10*t. Therefore, the total cost for all radios sold would be the number sold (Q) multiplied by this per-radio cost. So total cost = Q * 0.10 * t.

Wait, but let me think again. Suppose I sell Q radios this year. Each radio has a 10% chance each year of failing. So for each radio, over t years, the expected number of failures is 0.10 * t. So the total expected failures across all radios is Q * (0.10 * t). Each failure costs $1, so total repair cost is Q * 0.10 * t * 1 = Q * 0.10 t.

So the profit per radio is $2.80, so total revenue from sales is Q * 2.80. But then we subtract the repair costs, which is Q * 0.10 t. So total profit P is:

P = (Q * 2.80) - (Q * 0.10 t)

But wait, Q is given as 100 + 5t. So substituting Q into the equation:

P = (100 + 5t) * 2.80 - (100 +5t) * 0.10 t

Hmm, let me compute this step by step. Let's expand both terms.

First term: (100 +5t)*2.80 = 100*2.80 +5t*2.80 = 280 +14t.

Second term: (100 +5t)*0.10 t = 0.10 t *100 +0.10 t *5t = 10t + 0.5 t².

So putting it all together:

P = (280 +14t) - (10t + 0.5t²) = 280 +14t -10t -0.5t² = 280 +4t -0.5t².

So the profit function is P(t) = -0.5 t² +4t +280.

Now, to find the maximum profit, since this is a quadratic equation opening downward (because the coefficient of t² is negative), the maximum occurs at the vertex. The vertex of a parabola at² + bt + c is at t = -b/(2a).

In this case, a = -0.5, b=4. So t = -4/(2*(-0.5)) = -4 / (-1) = 4.

So t=4 years. So the maximum profit is achieved when the guarantee is 4 years.

Looking back at the options, option D is 4 years. So the answer should be D.

To determine the optimal guarantee period \( t \) that maximizes profit for Company A, we analyze the relationship between the number of radios sold, the associated costs, and the profit.

The number of radios sold in a year is given by \( Q = 100 + 5t \), where \( t \) is the length of the guarantee period. The company makes a profit of $2.80 per radio sold, but incurs a repair cost of $1 for each radio that fails. Since 10% of radios fail each year, the expected repair cost per radio over \( t \) years is \( 0.10 \cdot t \). Therefore, the total repair cost for all radios sold is \( Q \cdot 0.10 \cdot t \).

The total profit \( P \) is calculated as:

\[
P = (\text{Profit per radio} \cdot Q) - (\text{Repair cost per radio} \cdot Q)
\]

Substituting \( Q = 100 + 5t \), the profit function becomes:

\[
P = (2.80 \cdot (100 + 5t)) - (0.10 \cdot t \cdot (100 + 5t))
\]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[
P = (280 + 14t) - (10t + 0.5t^2) = 280 + 4t - 0.5t^2
\]

This is a quadratic function of the form \( P(t) = -0.5t^2 + 4t + 280 \), which opens downward. The maximum profit occurs at the vertex of the parabola, where:

\[
t = -\frac{b}{2a}
\]

Here, \( a = -0.5 \) and \( b = 4 \), so:

\[
t = -\frac{4}{2(-0.5)} = 4
\]

Thus, the guarantee period \( t \) that maximizes profit is 4 years. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

**D: 4 years**
