Question:

A 30-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 2-day history of abdominal pain. She has a history of recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, sinusitis, and pancreatitis. She has thick nasal secretions. She says that her sweat is salty and crystallizes on her skin. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Physical examination shows epigastric tenderness. Genetic testing for the 36 most common mutations shows a detectable mutation (G551D) in one allele of the CFTR gene. Which of the following best explains this patient's clinical phenotype?

Options:

A: Both CFTR alleles must be mutated to produce symptoms
B: Only one G551D allele is needed in CFTR
C: The patient is a CFTR obligate carrier
D: The patient's symptoms are coincidental and not related to the CFTR mutation
E: The G551D mutation in CFTR does not cause symptoms
F: The patient's CFTR mutation is unrelated to her clinical phenotype
G: The second CFTR mutation was not detected by the testing obtained
H: The patient's clinical phenotype is due to a mutation in a different gene
I: The patient has a rare form of CFTR mutation that requires two alleles
J: The CFTR mutation is associated with her clinical phenotype but not the cause

Okay, so I've got this question about a patient with some specific symptoms and a genetic test result. I'm a bit rusty on my genetics, but I'll try to think it through.

The patient is a 30-year-old woman with a history of recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, sinusitis, and pancreatitis. She also mentions thick nasal secretions and salty sweat that crystallizes. On physical exam, she has epigastric tenderness. Her genetic test for CFTR showed a detectable mutation, G551D, in one allele.

Hmm, I remember that CFTR is related to cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disease, right? So that means you need two defective alleles to have the disease. But wait, there's something about carriers. Carriers have one defective allele and one normal. They usually don't show symptoms because the normal allele compensates.

But this patient has a mutation in one allele. The question is, what does that mean for her symptoms? Her symptoms seem to align with cystic fibrosis. Like, salty sweat is a classic sign. But she only has one mutation. Oh wait, but sometimes people can have symptoms that are milder or atypical when they have certain mutations. Or maybe she's a carrier but has some symptoms because of other factors.

Wait, the genetic testing only checked for the 36 most common mutations. So maybe she has another mutation that wasn't detected. Because if she only has one mutation, she's a carrier, which usually doesn't cause disease. But if she's actually a carrier, why is she having symptoms?

Alternatively, maybe she has two mutations, but the test only found one. So the other mutation is rare and not among the 36 tested. So she might actually have two defective alleles, making her have the disease, but the test only found one.

So looking at the options:

Option A: Both CFTR alleles must be mutated to produce symptoms. That aligns with the recessive model. But the patient has symptoms, so if she only has one mutation, maybe A is not the case because she is showing symptoms.

Wait, but maybe she doesn't have CF after all. Because CF is a recessive disease, so she needs two mutations. So if she has only G551D, she's a carrier. But her symptoms could be coincidental. Alternatively, maybe the mutation G551D is dominant? No, I don't think so. CF is recessive, so one mutation doesn't cause it.

Wait, but I've heard about some CFTR mutations leading to varying severity or even some being associated with a milder form where carriers might have some issues. Or maybe it's a dominant mutation? No, CF is recessive, so dominant doesn't make sense.

So if she has one mutation, she's a carrier. But carriers are usually asymptomatic. However, sometimes they can have some mild symptoms. Or perhaps she's actually got two mutations, but the second wasn't detected because the test didn't look for it.

So looking at the options again.

Option G says the second mutation wasn't detected by the testing. That makes sense. So she has two mutations, but only one was found. So she actually has CF, but the test missed the other mutation.

But what about her symptoms? Her symptoms are consistent with CF. So if she actually has two mutations, then she has CF. But the test found only one. So the best explanation would be that the second mutation is present but wasn't detected.

Alternatively, option C says she's an obligate carrier. An obligate carrier is someone who, by family history, must carry a mutation. But in this case, she's a patient with symptoms, so I don't think C explains her condition.

Option E says the G551D mutation doesn't cause symptoms. But G551D is a known CF-causing mutation. So E is incorrect.

Option F says the mutation is unrelated. But her symptoms are classic CF, so F is wrong.

Option D says the symptoms are coincidental. Maybe, but she has multiple symptoms that align with CF, so it's more likely related.

Option G seems plausible. She has two mutations, but only one was found. So she does have CF, but the test didn't pick up the second mutation.

Wait, but what about the possibility of her being a carrier but having some symptoms? I thought carriers usually don't have the disease. So if she only has one mutation, she can't have CF. But maybe she's compound heterozygous, with another mutation that wasn't detected.

So the best answer would be G: The second CFTR mutation wasn't detected by the test.

The patient is a 30-year-old woman with symptoms consistent with cystic fibrosis (CF), including recurrent upper respiratory tract infections, sinusitis, pancreatitis, thick nasal secretions, and salty sweat. Genetic testing revealed a G551D mutation in one allele of the CFTR gene. Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder, meaning two defective CFTR alleles are typically required to manifest the disease. However, the patientâ€™s symptoms suggest a clinical phenotype consistent with CF.

The genetic testing only identified 36 of the most common CFTR mutations. It is possible that the patient has a second, rare mutation that was not detected by the testing. If this is the case, she would have two defective CFTR alleles, fulfilling the genetic criteria for CF. This would explain her symptoms, as she would no longer be asymptomatic like a typical carrier but rather have the disease due to two mutations.

Other options are less likely. For example, the idea that she is an obligate carrier (Option C) does not explain her symptoms, as carriers usually do not exhibit clinical manifestations. Similarly, the notion that her symptoms are coincidental (Option D) is unlikely given the strong alignment of her symptoms with CF. The G551D mutation is a known CF-causing mutation, so it is not correct to say it does not cause symptoms (Option E). Additionally, there is no evidence to suggest the mutation is unrelated to her phenotype (Option F) or that her symptoms are due to a different gene (Option H).

The most plausible explanation is that the patient has a second CFTR mutation that was not detected by the limited genetic testing, making her symptomatic due to CF.
