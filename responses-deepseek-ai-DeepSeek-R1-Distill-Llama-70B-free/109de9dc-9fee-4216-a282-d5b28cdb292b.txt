Okay, so I've got this question about Indian public opinion on diversity. The question is asking what percentage of Indians think that having more people from different races, ethnic groups, and nationalities makes the country a better place to live, as of 2018.

Hmm, I'm not exactly sure of the exact figure, but I remember reading some surveys about diversity perceptions in various countries. I think there was a global survey by Pew Research or something similar around that time. Let me try to recall.

I know that in many countries, opinions on immigration and diversity can vary widely. In some places, people are more accepting and see diversity as a positive, while others might be more skeptical. For India, which is a very diverse country itself with many ethnic and linguistic groups, I'm not sure how that translates to opinions on increasing diversity from other countries.

Wait, I think I remember that in some of the Pew surveys, India had a relatively high percentage of people who view diversity positively. But I'm not certain about the exact number. Let's see the options: the choices range from as low as 14% up to 97%, which is a huge spread.

I think in some of the more developed countries, like Canada or Sweden, the percentage is quite high, maybe around 70-80%. But for India, I'm not sure if it's that high. Maybe it's lower but still a significant percentage.

I also recall that sometimes these surveys can vary based on how the question is phrased. If the question is about the country being a better place to live because of diversity, the response might be more positive than if it's about economic impacts or cultural changes.

Wait, I think the correct figure for India around that time was something like 45%. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's around 38%. Both options D (38%) and G (45%) are in the choices.

Alternatively, maybe I'm confusing it with another country. Let me think again. I remember that in some Asian countries, the support for diversity is lower compared to Western countries. But India, being a diverse nation, might have a higher acceptance.

Another angle: sometimes in these surveys, younger people and more educated individuals are more likely to support diversity. But without knowing the exact demographics of the survey sample, it's hard to say.

I think the figure I came across was around 45%. So looking at the options, G is 45%. Alternatively, maybe it's 38% as in option D. Or perhaps I'm mixing it up with another statistic.

Wait, another thought: I remember a survey where about 53% of Indians had a positive view on diversity. Option A is 53%. But I'm not certain if that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the number was higher. Maybe 68%, which is option H. But I'm more inclined towards thinking it's in the 40s.

Wait, I should try to eliminate some options. The very high options like 80% (F), 90% (I), 97% (J) seem too high for any country except maybe some very progressive ones. I don't think India had that high a percentage in 2018.

Similarly, the very low options like 14% (C), 23% (E) seem too low, given that India is already a diverse country and might have a more positive outlook.

So narrowing it down to options A (53%), D (38%), G (45%), H (68%).

I think I read that around 45% of Indians viewed diversity positively, so option G. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, I might have seen a different figure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the source. If it's from a Pew Research survey, they often report these kinds of statistics. Let me try to recall any specific data points from their reports around 2018.

I think in a Pew survey, they asked about whether having people from many different backgrounds makes the country a better place. For India, the percentage was around 45%. So I'm leaning towards option G.

But I'm not entirely certain. Another approach: sometimes these figures can be found in reports on global attitudes towards immigration and diversity. For example, in some European countries, the support is around 70%, but in others, it's lower.

Wait, another angle: I think in 2018, a survey found that 53% of Indians believed diversity made the country better. That would be option A. But I'm getting a bit confused now.

Alternatively, perhaps it's lower. I'm not recalling clearly. If I had to guess, I'd say it's either 38%, 45%, or 53%. Since I'm not sure, I have to make an educated guess.

Wait, another thought: sometimes these surveys might report that a majority in India are neutral or see no difference. If that's the case, maybe the percentage is lower, like 38% or 45%.

I think I'll go with option G, 45%, as my best guess.

As of 2018, the percentage of Indians who believe that having an increasing number of people from different races, ethnic groups, and nationalities makes the country a better place to live is estimated to be around 45%. This figure aligns with the understanding that India, being a diverse nation, might have a moderately positive outlook on diversity, though not as high as in some Western countries. After considering various possibilities and eliminating extremes, 45% seems the most plausible answer.
