Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about equilibrium concentrations. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The reaction given is 3 C₂H₂ ⇌ C₆H₆, and the equilibrium constant K_eq is 4 at a certain temperature. The question says that the equilibrium concentration of C₂H₂ is 0.5 moles per liter, and we need to find the concentration of C₆H₆.

Wait, right. I remember that the equilibrium constant expression for a reaction aA + bB ⇌ cC + dD is K_eq = [C]^c [D]^d / [A]^a [B]^b. So in this case, the reaction is 3 moles of C₂H₂ forming one mole of C₆H₆. So the expression should be K_eq = [C₆H₆] / [C₂H₂]^3.

Yes, that makes sense. So plugging in the numbers, K_eq is 4. The [C₂H₂] is 0.5 M. Let me write that equation down:

4 = [C₆H₆] / (0.5)^3.

Wait, (0.5)^3 is 0.125. So 4 = [C6H6]/0.125. To find [C6H6], I multiply both sides by 0.125.

So [C6H6] = 4 * 0.125. Let me calculate that. 4 * 0.125 is 0.5. So that would make [C6H6] equal to 0.5 M.

But wait, let me double-check. If I plug those numbers back into the K_eq expression, does it hold?

K_eq = (0.5) / (0.5)^3. That's 0.5 / 0.125. 0.5 divided by 0.125 is 4, which matches the given K_eq. So that's correct.

Looking at the options, option I is 0.5 moles per liter. So the answer should be I.

To solve the problem, we start with the equilibrium constant expression for the reaction:

\[
K_{eq} = \frac{[C_6H_6]}{[C_2H_2]^3}
\]

Given \( K_{eq} = 4 \) and \([C_2H_2] = 0.5 \, \text{M}\), we substitute these values into the equation:

\[
4 = \frac{[C_6H_6]}{(0.5)^3}
\]

Calculating \((0.5)^3 = 0.125\), the equation becomes:

\[
4 = \frac{[C_6H_6]}{0.125}
\]

Rearranging to solve for \([C_6H_6]\):

\[
[C_6H_6] = 4 \times 0.125 = 0.5 \, \text{M}
\]

To verify, substituting \([C_6H_6] = 0.5 \, \text{M}\) and \([C_2H_2] = 0.5 \, \text{M}\) back into the equilibrium expression confirms \( K_{eq} = 4 \), which is consistent with the given data.

Thus, the concentration of \( C_6H_6 \) is 0.5 moles per liter, corresponding to option I.
