Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about vitamin A deficiency in children, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by recalling what I know about vitamin A and its effects on the body, especially in children.

Vitamin A is an essential nutrient, and I remember it's important for vision health. But wait, the question is about deficiency causing something else, not night blindness or anything related to eyesight. Hmm.

I think vitamin A plays a role in the immune system. Oh right, it supports the immune function, which means a deficiency could make someone more susceptible to infections. But the options don't directly mention immune problems.

Looking at the options:

A: Poor muscle development – I'm not sure. I know protein is more directly related to muscle growth, but maybe vitamins contribute too.

B: Increased risk of mortality – That sounds possible. If the immune system is weaker, kids might be more likely to die from infections or other illnesses.

C: Goitre – That's related to iodine deficiency, not vitamin A. So probably not this one.

D: Increased risk of obesity – I haven't heard that link before. Obesity is more about calorie intake and metabolism, maybe not directly vitamins.

E: Increased risk of heart disease – I don't recall vitamin A being directly linked to heart disease in children. Maybe in adults with long-term issues, but not sure.

F: Poor cognitive development – I'm a bit fuzzy here. Cognitive development is more commonly linked with deficiencies like iodine or iron, which affect brain development.

Wait, going back, I think vitamin A deficiency can lead to more severe health issues. In children, severe deficiency can cause not just night blindness but also increases susceptibility to diseases like measles, which can be fatal. So if they're more prone to serious illnesses, that would increase their risk of mortality, which points to option B.

Alternatively, I remember that vitamin A is important for epithelial cells, which line the respiratory, urinary, and intestinal tracts. Without enough vitamin A, these barriers are weaker, making infections more likely and possibly more severe. So this supports the idea that the risk of mortality increases.

Another angle: I think the WHO or UNICEF has programs to give vitamin A supplements to children in developing countries to reduce child mortality. That would align with option B being correct.

So putting it all together, the most likely answer is B: Increased risk of mortality.

The correct answer is B: Increased risk of mortality.

Vitamin A is crucial for maintaining immune function and epithelial integrity, which helps protect against infections. In children, a deficiency can lead to weakened immunity, making them more susceptible to severe illnesses like measles. This increased susceptibility can result in a higher risk of mortality. Additionally, global health initiatives often provide vitamin A supplements to reduce child mortality, further supporting this conclusion.

Answer: B
