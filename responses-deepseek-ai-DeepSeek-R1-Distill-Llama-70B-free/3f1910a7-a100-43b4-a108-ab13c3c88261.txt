Question:

One year ago, while driving through an intersection, the defendant's car collided with the plaintiff's car. The plaintiff sued, claiming that the defendant ran a red light. In her case-in-chief, the plaintiff testified that immediately after the accident, a bystander, who was a local resident, screamed at the defendant, "You jerk. . . you drove through the red light. " In his case-in-chief, the defendant now calls a police accident investigator to testify that the plaintiff told him that she "didn't see the color of the light when she entered the intersection because she was dialing a number on her cell phone. "The investigator's testimony should be

Options:

A: admitted, because the plaintiff's statement to the investigator is a prior inconsistent statement.
B: excluded, because the plaintiff's statement to the investigator is hearsay.
C: admitted, because the plaintiff's cell phone use is relevant to the issue of negligence.
D: excluded, because the investigator's testimony is second-hand information and therefore unreliable.
E: admitted, because the accident investigator gathered the information in the course of his official duties.
F: admitted, because the plaintiff's inconsistent statement has bearing on her credibility.
G: admitted, because it is a statement against interest and therefore an exception to the hearsay rule.
H: excluded, because the statement was not made under oath and therefore may not be truthful.
I: excluded, because the defendant did not have the opportunity to cross-examine the plaintiff at the time she made the statement.

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this evidence question here. Let me read it carefully. The scenario is about a car accident that happened a year ago. The plaintiff sued the defendant, claiming the defendant ran a red light. 

In the plaintiff's case, she testified that right after the accident, a bystander yelled at the defendant, "You jerk... you drove through the red light." Now, the defendant is calling a police accident investigator to testify. The investigator will say that the plaintiff told him she didn't see the color of the light because she was dialing on her cell phone.

The question is about whether the investigator's testimony should be admitted or excluded. The options are from A to I, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I think I need to figure out what the issue is here. The defendant is trying to introduce a statement made by the plaintiff to the investigator. So, is this statement admissible?

I remember that statements made by a party can sometimes be used against them. But wait, the plaintiff is the one who made the statement here. So if the defendant is presenting this, is it hearsay? Because the statement is being offered for the truth of the matterâ€”that she didn't see the light, implying she was maybe distracted or at fault.

Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. So the plaintiff's statement to the investigator is being offered to show she didn't see the light, which would make her potentially negligent. So that's hearsay unless there's an exception.

But wait, there's an exception for statements by a party-opponent. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) 801(d)(2), a statement is not hearsay if it's offered against a party and was made by the party's agent or the party himself. But wait, in this case, the plaintiff is the party, so her own statement is admissible as a party admission.

So the statement she made to the investigator would be an admission of a party-opponent. So it's not hearsay under FRE 801(d)(2)(A). Therefore, the statement should be admissible.

Wait, but let me think again. The statement is that she didn't see the color of the light because she was on her cell phone. So that's an admission that she might have been negligent, which is relevant. So even if it's hearsay, as a party admission, it's allowed.

Looking at the options, let's see.

Option A: admitted because prior inconsistent statement. Wait, prior inconsistent statements can be used as substantive evidence if they were given under oath at a trial, hearing, or other proceeding. But here, the plaintiff's statement wasn't made under oath during testimony, right? It was made to the investigator. So maybe it's not a prior inconsistent statement for that purpose. So A might not be correct.

Option B: excluded because hearsay. But wait, no, because it's a party admission, so it's not hearsay. So B is wrong.

Option C: admitted because cell phone use is relevant to negligence. Well, relevance is correct, but the question is about hearsay. So even if relevant, if it's hearsay and no exception applies, it's excluded. But since we think it's a party admission, it's admissible, so C is correct in part but the reasoning is about hearsay. So C is a possible answer, but maybe not the best.

Option F: admitted because the inconsistent statement affects credibility. Wait, prior inconsistent statements can be used to impeach a witness's credibility. But in this case, the defendant is using it as substantive evidence, not just to impeach. So the admissibility would be under 801(d)(2) as a party admission, making it substantive. But F says it's about credibility, which might be a secondary effect, but the main reason is it's a party admission. So maybe F is not the best answer.

Option G: admitted because it's a statement against interest. But the statement here isn't against the plaintiff's interest at the time it was made. She was saying she didn't see the light, which could imply she was at fault, maybe. But does that make it against her interest? Maybe, but it's more of a party admission than a statement against interest. So G might not be correct, unless the statement is self-inculpatory.

Wait, the statement is that she didn't see the light because she was on her phone. That could be an admission of negligence, which would be against her interest in the lawsuit. So perhaps it's a statement against interest under FRE 804(b)(3). But for that, the declarant must be unavailable, right? Because 804 applies when the declarant is unavailable. Here, the plaintiff is available because she testified. So the statement against interest exception wouldn't apply here. So G is incorrect.

Option E: admitted because the investigator gathered the info in official duties. That sounds like it's talking about public records or something, but I don't think that applies here. The admissibility isn't about the source being official duties but about the content of the statement.

Option D: excluded because second-hand and unreliable. But that's not a valid reason; hearsay can be reliable or not, but if it's a party admission, it's allowed.

Option H: excluded because not under oath. But party admissions don't have to be under oath. So H is incorrect.

Option I: excluded because no cross-examination. But again, party admissions don't require cross-examination at the time. So I is wrong.

So going back, the correct reasoning is that the statement is a party admission, making it non-hearsay. So the testimony should be admitted. Looking at the options, A says it's a prior inconsistent statement. But prior inconsistent statements under oath can be used, but this wasn't under oath. So prior inconsistent may not apply here. Alternatively, F says it's about credibility, but the main reason is it's a party admission.

Wait, let's think about prior inconsistent statements. If a witness makes a statement inconsistent with their testimony, it can be used to impeach them. But to use it as substantive evidence, it needs to meet certain conditions. But in this case, the statement is being offered by the defendant, who is a party-opponent, so it's an admission. So it's not about prior inconsistency but about being a party's own statement against them.

So the correct answer should be A? Wait, no, because prior inconsistent statements as substantive evidence require that they were made under oath. Since the statement to the investigator wasn't under oath, it can't be used as a prior inconsistent statement for substantive purposes. Therefore, A is incorrect.

Wait, but the plaintiff's statement to the investigator would be admissible as a party admission, regardless of whether it's inconsistent. So the fact that she made this statement is an admission, so it's not hearsay. Therefore, the correct option would be A: admitted because prior inconsistent statement. Wait, no, because prior inconsistent is a different rule. So perhaps the correct reason is that it's a party admission, which would make it admissible regardless of whether it's inconsistent.

Looking back at the options, option A is about prior inconsistent, which is a different rule. So if the statement is a party admission, it's admissible under 801(d)(2)(A). So which option says that? None of the options explicitly say "party admission," but let's see.

Option F says it's admitted because the inconsistent statement has bearing on her credibility. That's about impeachment, not the substantive use. But the defendant is using it to show she's lying, but more importantly, to show she was negligent.

Wait, perhaps the statement is both a prior inconsistent statement and a party admission. Wait, but prior inconsistent statements can be used to impeach, but also as substantive evidence if they meet the requirements. But since this statement wasn't under oath, it can't be used as a prior inconsistent statement for substantive purposes. So the only way it's admissible is as a party admission.

Looking at the options, the only one that addresses the hearsay issue is option A: admitted because prior inconsistent. But that's not correct because prior inconsistent under oath is needed for substantive use. So perhaps the correct answer is F: admitted because the inconsistent statement has bearing on her credibility.

Wait, no. Because the defendant is using it not just to impeach but to prove she's at fault. So the statement is being used substantively, not just for credibility. So the only way it's admissible is as a party admission, which is non-hearsay.

But looking at the options, none of them say "party admission." So perhaps the closest is option A, but that's not correct because prior inconsistent requires oath. So perhaps option F: admitted because bearing on credibility.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let's rethink. The statement is being offered to show that the plaintiff didn't see the light, implying she was distracted, which is relevant to her negligence. It's a statement by the plaintiff, so it's a party admission. Therefore, it's not hearsay, so it's admissible. So the reason it's admissible is that it's a prior statement by the party.

Looking at the options, option A says prior inconsistent statement. But prior inconsistent can be used if under oath, which it's not. So perhaps the correct option is F: admitted because it affects credibility.

Wait, but F says it's admitted because the inconsistent statement has bearing on credibility. That's impeachment. But the defendant is using it to prove the plaintiff was at fault, not just to say she's lying. So the primary purpose is substantive. So the correct reason is that it's a party admission, making it non-hearsay.

But none of the options directly state that. So perhaps the correct answer is A, but I'm not sure because prior inconsistent requires under oath. Alternatively, perhaps option F is the closest, but I'm not confident.

Wait, maybe I should look at each option again.

Option A: admitted as prior inconsistent statement. But prior inconsistent statements not under oath are only for impeachment, not for substantive evidence. So the statement could be used to impeach the plaintiff's credibility, but not as substantive evidence unless it's a party admission.

Option F: admitted because bearing on credibility. That's about impeachment, but the testimony is being used to prove the fact, not just to impeach.

Option C: admitted because cell phone use is relevant. That's correct in that it's relevant, but the question is about hearsay. Since it's a party admission, it's admissible, so C's reasoning is incomplete but the result is correct.

Wait, but C says it's admitted because it's relevant to negligence. So maybe C is correct because the evidence is relevant and not hearsay, but the option doesn't address the hearsay point. Alternatively, the correct reasoning is that it's a party admission, which is non-hearsay, making it admissible.

Looking back, the correct answer should be that the statement is admissible as a party admission, so it's not hearsay. Therefore, the correct option is A: admitted as a prior inconsistent statement. Wait, no, because prior inconsistent under oath is required for substantive use. So perhaps the correct answer is F, but I'm getting confused.

Wait, another approach. The bystander's statement is hearsay because it's an out-of-court statement offered for truth. But in the plaintiff's case, she's testifying about what the bystander said. So that's hearsay within hearsay. Unless there's an exception, that might be inadmissible. But that's not the issue here; the issue is the defendant's evidence.

So focusing on the defendant's evidence: the investigator testifying about what the plaintiff said. The plaintiff's statement is being offered against her, so it's a party admission. Therefore, it's not hearsay. So the correct answer is that the testimony is admitted because it's a party admission, making it non-hearsay.

Looking at the options, the only one that addresses hearsay is option B, which says excluded because hearsay. But since it's a party admission, B is wrong.

So the correct answer must be A, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, option F says it's admitted because it affects credibility, but that's impeachment, not the main reason.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F. Because the statement is inconsistent with her testimony, it can be used to impeach her credibility. But the defendant is using it to prove she's at fault, not just to impeach. So F may not be the right reason.

I'm getting stuck, but I think the correct answer is A: admitted because prior inconsistent statement. Wait, no, because prior inconsistent must be under oath. So perhaps the correct answer is F: admitted because it affects credibility. But that's impeachment, and the evidence is being used substantively.

Wait, I'm overcomplicating. Let me remember: a party's own statement is admissible as a party admission, making it non-hearsay. So the correct answer is that it's admitted, so looking at the options, option A says prior inconsistent. But that's not the right reason. So perhaps the correct answer is F, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A, because it's a prior inconsistent statement, but that's only for impeachment unless under oath.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps option C is correct because the statement is relevant and not hearsay. So the correct answer is C: admitted because cell phone use is relevant.

No, because the question is about hearsay, so the correct answer must address that. The statement is not hearsay because it's a party admission. So the correct option is A, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the answer is A: admitted as prior inconsistent statement. Because prior inconsistent statements can be admitted even if not under oath, but only for impeachment. Wait, no, prior inconsistent statements not under oath can be used for impeachment but not as substantive evidence. So the statement would be admissible for impeachment, but the defendant is using it to prove the fact. So the only way it's admissible substantively is as a party admission.

So the correct answer is that it's admissible as a party admission, which is option A? No, because prior inconsistent requires under oath for substantive use.

I think I'm going in circles. Let me try to conclude. The statement is a party admission, so it's not hearsay. Therefore, the correct answer is A: admitted, because prior inconsistent. Wait, no, because prior inconsistent is not the reason here. The reason is it's a party admission.

Looking at the options, none directly state party admission. So perhaps the correct answer is F: admitted because it's inconsistent and affects credibility. But that's about impeachment, not substantive use. Alternatively, option C is about relevance, which is correct, but the hearsay issue is more crucial.

Wait, the correct answer should be A, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps option F is correct.

Wait, I think the correct answer is A: admitted because prior inconsistent statement. Wait, no, because prior inconsistent statements not under oath can't be used substantively. So the only way it's admissible is as a party admission. So the correct answer is A is incorrect, and F is incorrect. Hmm.

Wait, looking back, option F says admitted because the inconsistent statement has bearing on her credibility. So the testimony is admissible to impeach her credibility. But the defendant can also use it as substantive evidence because it's a party admission. So the correct answer is that it's admitted, and the reason is that it's a party admission, making it non-hearsay.

But none of the options say that. So perhaps the closest is option F, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is A because it's a prior inconsistent statement, but I'm not confident.

Wait, I think the correct answer is A: admitted because prior inconsistent statement. Because prior inconsistent statements can be used even if not under oath, but only for impeachment. But the defendant is using it as substantive evidence, so it's only admissible as a party admission.

But since the options don't have party admission, perhaps the correct answer is F.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. I think the correct answer is A: admitted because prior inconsistent statement, but that's not the right reason. Alternatively, the correct answer is F, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about what each option says.

Option A: admitted because prior inconsistent statement. So prior inconsistent statements can be used as substantive evidence only if they were made under oath. Since this statement wasn't under oath, it can't be used as substantive evidence under the prior inconsistent rule. Therefore, A is incorrect.

Option F: admitted because the inconsistent statement has bearing on her credibility. That's correct because the statement can be used to impeach her credibility, showing she made inconsistent statements. So the testimony is admissible for that purpose. But the defendant is trying to use it to prove she's at fault, not just to impeach. So perhaps the testimony is admissible for impeachment, but the question is about whether it's admissible, period.

But the question doesn't specify whether it's offered for impeachment or substantive purposes. So if it's offered for impeachment, it's admissible, but if for substantive, only if it's a party admission.

Wait, the defendant is using it in his case-in-chief, presumably to prove the plaintiff was at fault. So it's being used substantively. Therefore, it's admissible as a party admission, making it non-hearsay.

But none of the options directly address that. So perhaps the correct answer is F, because it's about credibility, but that's only for impeachment.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. The correct answer is A: admitted because prior inconsistent statement. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F because the statement is inconsistent and thus affects credibility, making it admissible. But again, that's impeachment, not substantive.

I think I've spent too much time on this. Based on what I know, the statement is a party admission, so it's not hearsay. Therefore, it's admissible. Looking at the options, the only one that says admitted and addresses the hearsay issue correctly is option A: admitted as prior inconsistent. But that's not the right reason. Alternatively, option F is about credibility, which is correct for impeachment, but the evidence is being used substantively.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F. Because the statement is inconsistent with her testimony, it can be used to impeach her credibility, thus it's admissible. But the defendant is using it to prove she's at fault, which is substantive use. So for substantive use, it's a party admission, making it non-hearsay, so it's admissible. So the correct answer is that it's admitted because it's a party admission, non-hearsay, so the correct option is A? No, because prior inconsistent requires under oath.

I think I'm stuck. I'll go with option F: admitted because it has bearing on credibility.

The question revolves around the admissibility of a statement made by the plaintiff to a police accident investigator, where she admitted she did not see the color of the light because she was dialing on her cell phone. The defendant seeks to introduce
