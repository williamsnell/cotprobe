Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about a reversible reaction and the equilibrium constant. Let me see if I can figure this out. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The reaction given is H2 + X2 ⇌ 2HX. It's a second-order reaction, I guess because each reactant is first-order, adding up to second overall. The rate constants are k_a for the forward reaction and k_b for the reverse.

I remember that for a reversible reaction, the equilibrium constant K is related to the rate constants. The general formula, I think, is K equals the forward rate constant divided by the reverse rate constant, or something like that. Wait, no, maybe it's the other way around. Or is it the ratio of the products over reactants in terms of their concentrations?

Wait, the equilibrium expression for a reaction aA + bB ⇌ cC + dD is K = [C]^c [D]^d / [A]^a [B]^b. But when it comes to rate constants, the relation is K = (k_a) / (k_b). Or wait, maybe it's the reverse? Because I've seen it both ways in different contexts.

Let me think. The rate of the forward reaction is rate_forward = k_a [H2][X2]. The rate of the reverse reaction is rate_backward = k_b [HX]^2. At equilibrium, these two rates are equal. So setting them equal:

k_a [H2][X2] = k_b [HX]^2.

If I rearrange this to solve for the ratio of concentrations, I get [HX]^2 / ([H2][X2]) = k_a / k_b. But wait, the left side is the equilibrium constant K, because for the reaction, the products are HX squared and the reactants are H2 and X2 each to the first power.

So K = (k_a) / (k_b). That makes sense because K is the ratio of products to reactants, which comes from the ratio of the forward and reverse rate constants.

Looking at the options, option D says (k_a / k_b) = K. So that would be the correct answer. Let me double-check the other options to make sure.

Option A is k_b / k_a, which is the inverse. So that's not it. Option E is the square root of (k_a/k_b), which doesn't fit because I don't see any square roots in the equation I derived. Option J is (k_a squared)/k_b. That would be k_a²/k_b, which isn't what we have. So yeah, Option D is the right choice.

The reaction given is H₂ + X₂ ⇌ 2HX, and the goal is to express the thermodynamic equilibrium constant \( K \) in terms of the forward rate constant \( k_a \) and the reverse rate constant \( k_b \). 

For a reversible reaction, the equilibrium constant \( K \) is defined as the ratio of the forward rate constant to the reverse rate constant:

\[
K = \frac{k_a}{k_b}.
\]

This relationship is derived from the condition that, at equilibrium, the forward and reverse reaction rates are equal:

\[
k_a [H_2][X_2] = k_b [HX]^2.
\]

Rearranging this equation gives:

\[
K = \frac{[HX]^2}{[H_2][X_2]} = \frac{k_a}{k_b}.
\]

Among the given options, only **Option D** correctly expresses this relationship. Other options, such as \( K = k_b / k_a \) (Option A), \( K = \sqrt{k_a / k_b} \) (Option E), or \( K = k_a^2 / k_b \) (Option J), do not align with the derived formula.

**Answer: D**
