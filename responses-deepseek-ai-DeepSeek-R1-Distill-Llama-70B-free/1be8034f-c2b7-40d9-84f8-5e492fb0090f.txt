The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Owner has a property in fee simple absolute. He executes a deed to Friend with the words "To Friend for life and then to the heirs of Owner." Under common law principles the conveyance to the heirs is not effective. Thus, the deed would result in a life estate to Friend with a reversion back to Owner. That result is due to what common law doctrine?

Options:

A: The doctrine of eminent domain
B: The rule of survivorship
C: The rule of destructibility of contingent remainders
D: The rule in Shelly's case
E: The doctrine of escheat
F: The doctrine of concurrent ownership
G: The doctrine of worthier title
H: The rule of lapse
I: The rule against perpetuities
J: The doctrine of adverse possession

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about property law, specifically dealing with estates and future interests. Hmm, let's see. The question is about a deed from an owner to a friend, and what happens under common law principles.

Alright, the scenario is that the owner has a fee simple absolute, which means they own the property completely, without any time limits, right? Then the owner executes a deed to Friend with the words "To Friend for life and then to the heirs of Owner." Wait, so Friend gets a life estate, and then after Friend dies, it's supposed to go to the Owner's heirs.

But the question says that under common law, this conveyance to the heirs isn't effective. So instead, the result is a life estate to Friend with a reversion back to the Owner. The question is why that happens, which common law doctrine causes this outcome.

I remember that when you create a future interest, certain rules apply. Let me think about the different doctrines. One of them is the rule against perpetuities, but I think that's more about whether an interest is valid because it might vest too far in the future. But here, the issue is about the effectiveness of the conveyance to the heirs.

Oh wait, another concept is the doctrine of worthier title. I think that's when a grantor tries to create a future interest in someone else, but if it's to the grantor's own heirs, there's a presumption that the grantor didn't intend to create a future interest beyond their death. Instead, it's seen as a reversion.

Wait, let me clarify. The grantor here is the Owner. The deed says after Friend's life, it goes to the heirs of Owner. So the Owner is trying to create a remainder in their own heirs. But under the doctrine of worthier title, a conveyance to the grantor's heirs is presumed to create a reversion, not a remainder, because it's assumed the grantor wouldn't want to give property to their heirs when they could just keep it themselves.

So in this case, the words "to the heirs of Owner" after the life estate would not create a valid remainder. Instead, the future interest would be a reversion, meaning after Friend's life estate, the property goes back to the Owner, not the Owner's heirs. That's because the law presumes a worthier title in the grantor (Owner) than in the heirs.

Let me think about the other options quickly. The rule in Shelley's case applies when a life estate is given to someone, and then the remainder is to the life tenant's heirs, which becomes a fee simple. But that's not the case here because the remainder is to the grantor's heirs, not the life tenant's.

The destructibility of contingent remainders applies when a contingent remainder fails because the condition isn't met by the time the prior estate ends. But here, the problem is more about the grantor's intent and the presumption against creating a remainder for their own heirs.

So the correct doctrine here is the doctrine of worthier title. That makes option G the correct answer.

The question involves a property law scenario where an owner conveys a life estate to Friend with the intention that the property then pass to the Owner's heirs. However, under common law principles, the conveyance to the heirs is not effective, resulting in a reversion to the Owner instead. This outcome is due to the doctrine of worthier title.

The doctrine of worthier title applies when a grantor attempts to create a future interest in their own heirs. The law presumes that the grantor would not intend to create a remainder for their heirs when they could instead retain the property themselves. Therefore, the conveyance to the heirs is treated as ineffective, and the property reverts back to the grantor (Owner) after the life estate ends.

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Eminent domain** is unrelated, as it involves government taking of property.
- **B: Survivorship** applies to joint tenancies, not this scenario.
- **C: Destructibility of contingent remainders** deals with failed conditions, not the issue here.
- **D: Rule in Shelley's case** applies when the remainder is to the life tenant's heirs, not the grantor's.
- **E: Escheat** involves property reverting to the state, irrelevant here.
- **F: Concurrent ownership** pertains to shared ownership, not applicable.
- **G: Worthier title** correctly explains the presumption against creating a remainder for the grantor's heirs.
- **H: Lapse** involves the failure of a future interest due to the death of the holder, not relevant.
- **I: Rule against perpetuities** concerns interests vesting too remotely, not applicable.
- **J: Adverse possession** involves gaining title through unauthorized use, unrelated.

Thus, the correct answer is based on the doctrine of worthier title, making **G** the correct choice.
