Question:

A patient cuts a peripheral motor nerve in their wrist when they fall through a plate glass window. If the nerve does not regenerate, after about 6 months the muscles it normally innervates will show signs of which of the four options below?

Options:

A: spastic paralysis
B: contracture
C: fasciculations
D: muscle stiffness
E: atrophy
F: hypertrophy
G: muscle rigidity
H: flaccid paralysis
I: muscle spasms
J: hyperreflexia

Okay, so I've got this question about nerve damage and muscle effects. Hmm, let me think through it step by step. 

The question says a patient cuts a peripheral motor nerve in the wrist. After about six months, if the nerve doesn't regenerate, what happens to the muscles it normally innervates. The options are various muscle-related terms.

Wait, I remember that peripheral nerves can sometimes regenerate, right? Like, if the injury isn't too bad. But if it doesn't regenerate, then the nerve can't send signals anymore. So the muscles those nerves control would be affected.

I think the key here is understanding what happens when a nerve is damaged and doesn't regenerate. Motor nerves are responsible for controlling muscle movement. So if the nerve is cut, the muscles it innervates won't receive any signals. That should lead to some form of paralysis, I guess.

Oh right, there are two types of paralysis related to nerve damage: flaccid and spastic. Flaccid is when the muscles become weak and floppy because the nerve isn't sending signals. Spastic is more about increased muscle tone, which I think is related to upper motor neuron damage, like in the brain or spinal cord. So in this case, it's a peripheral nerve issue, so probably flaccid.

Wait, but the question is about after six months. What changes occur over time? I remember that when a nerve is damaged, the muscles might first become paralyzed and then undergo atrophy because they're not being used. Atrophy is the wasting away of muscle tissue.

So if the nerve doesn't regenerate, the muscles can't function and will start to atrophy. But what about the type of paralysis? Initially, it would be flaccid, but over time, without any nerve input, the muscles just waste away.

Looking at the options: option E is atrophy. So that's probably the answer. But wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing things up. Flaccid paralysis is a condition, while atrophy is the muscle wasting. So the question is about the signs the muscles show, which would be atrophy.

Another point: after the nerve is cut, the muscles can't contract, so they become flaccid and then atrophy. So the correct answer would be E: atrophy.

When a peripheral motor nerve is cut and does not regenerate, the muscles it normally innervates lose their ability to receive nerve signals. This leads to a loss of muscle function and, over time, muscle wasting. Initially, the muscles may become flaccid due to the lack of innervation, but as time progresses, the muscles undergo atrophy, which is the wasting away of muscle tissue. Among the options provided, the most accurate description of the muscle's condition after six months is atrophy.

Answer: E
