Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about counseling minority group members. Let me think through this step by step.

The question is asking about research findings on the counseling of minority clients. The options are A through D. I remember learning that minority group members might face unique challenges when seeking counseling, which could affect their behavior in counseling settings.

Option A says they're more likely to seek group counseling than individual. I'm not sure about this. I think sometimes group therapy is used, but I don't recall if minorities specifically prefer it more. Maybe cultural factors influence this, but I'm not certain.

Option B states they remain in counseling for about the same time as non-minority clients. I think I've heard that sometimes minority clients might not stay as long. Maybe because of trust issues or feeling misunderstood by counselors. So this might not be correct.

Option C suggests they terminate counseling earlier than non-minority clients. This rings a bell. I remember reading that some studies show minority clients are more likely to drop out of counseling early. Reasons could include feeling that their concerns aren't being addressed culturally or maybe language barriers, or perhaps a lack of rapport with the counselor.

Option D says they seek counseling at the same rate as non-minorities. I think this is not accurate. There's often a disparity in seeking mental health services. Stigma, access issues, cultural beliefs about mental healthâ€”all these can contribute to lower rates of seeking help among minorities.

Putting it all together, the correct answer is probably C because minority clients tend to terminate counseling earlier. So the answer should be C.

The correct answer is based on the understanding that minority clients often face challenges such as cultural misunderstandings, trust issues, and societal barriers, leading them to terminate counseling earlier than non-minority clients.

Answer: C
