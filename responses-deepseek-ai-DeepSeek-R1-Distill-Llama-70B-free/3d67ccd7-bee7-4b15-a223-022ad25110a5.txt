Okay, so I'm trying to solve this electrochemistry problem. Let me read through the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The reaction given is:
H₂(g) + 2AgCl(s) + 2H₂O → 2Ag(s) + 2H₃O⁺(aq) + 2Cl⁻(aq)

We're given the standard free energies of formation for the compounds involved. The task is to find the cell voltage when the reaction is run under specific conditions: 25°C (which is standard temperature), 1 atm pressure, with H₂ activity as 1, and the activities of H₃O⁺ and Cl⁻ as 0.01 each.

Hmm, I remember that cell voltage, or electromotive force (EMF), is related to the Gibbs free energy change of the reaction. The formula I think is ΔG° = -nFE°, where n is the number of moles of electrons transferred, F is Faraday's constant, and E° is the standard cell potential.

Wait, but wait—since the conditions aren't all standard (like the activities aren't all 1), I should probably use the Nernst equation. The general formula is E = E° - (RT/nF) ln Q, but sometimes it's written with log instead of ln, depending on the convention. Oh right, for the Nernst equation, it's often E = E° - (0.05916 V / n) * log Q at 25°C.

Wait, no, I think the more precise formula is E = E° - ( (RT)/(nF) ) * ln Q. But since R is 8.314 J/mol·K, T is 298 K (25°C), F is about 96485 C/mol. So let's compute that factor.

Calculating (RT)/(nF): (8.314 * 298) / (n * 96485). Let's see, 8.314 * 300 is about 2494.2, but 298 is a bit less. Let me compute 8.314 * 298. 

8 * 298 = 2384, 0.314 *298 is about 93.772, so total is 2477.772 J/mol. Divide by (n * 96485). Wait, but the units: J to V? Because F is in C/mol, and 1 V = 1 J/C, so J/C would give volts. So 2477.772 J/mol divided by (n * 96485 C/mol) gives (2477.772)/(n *96485) volts. Let me compute that as approximately 2478 / (n * 96500) ≈ 0.0257 / n volts per unitless log Q. Wait, but the Nernst equation often uses log base 10, so maybe I should have used log instead of ln. Oh wait, right! Because the formula with log Q uses 0.05916 V at 25°C when using log. So the conversion factor is approximately 0.05916 V per n at 25°C.

Wait, perhaps I should just remember that the Nernst equation is E = E° - (0.05916/n) * log Q.

So first, I need to find E°, the standard cell potential, using the standard Gibbs free energy change. Then, adjust for the reaction quotient Q under the given conditions.

Let me start by calculating ΔG° for the reaction. ΔG° for the reaction is the sum of the ΔG_f° of the products minus the sum of the ΔG_f° of the reactants.

Looking at the reaction:

Reactants:
H₂(g): ΔG_f° is 0 (since it's an element in its standard state).
2 AgCl(s): each has ΔG_f° = -109.7 kJ/mol, so 2 * (-109.7) = -219.4 kJ.
2 H₂O(l): each is -237.2 kJ/mol, so 2 * (-237.2) = -474.4 kJ.

Total reactants: 0 + (-219.4) + (-474.4) = -693.8 kJ.

Products:
2 Ag(s): each is 0, so total 0.
2 H₃O⁺(aq) + 2 Cl⁻(aq): the given ΔG_f° is -368.4 kJ/mol for the combination (H₃O+ + Cl^-). So for two moles, 2*(-368.4) = -736.8 kJ.

Wait, wait—wait a second. The problem states that the standard free energy of formation of (H3O+ + Cl^-)(aq) is -368.4 kJ/mole. That might mean that for one mole of that combination, so for each mole of H3O+ and Cl^- pair. So in the reaction, we have 2 moles of H3O+ and 2 moles of Cl^-, so perhaps 2 moles of the (H3O+ + Cl^-) pair? Or is the formation for each individual ion?

Wait, no. The standard Gibbs free energy of formation for a compound is the change when 1 mole of the compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. But here, it's for the aqueous ions. So for AgCl(s), the ΔG_f° is the formation of AgCl from Ag and Cl₂, but in solution, for the ions, it's the formation of the ions from the elements.

Wait, but the question gives the ΔG_f° for H3O+ and Cl^- as -368.4 kJ/mole. So perhaps that's the combined value for both ions. Wait, but each H3O+ and Cl^- is one mole each, so per mole of each. So maybe the ΔG_f° for each ion is given? But that doesn't make sense, because ΔG_f° for individual ions can't be measured. So perhaps the given value is for the formation of the pair, meaning H3O+ + Cl^- from their elements.

Wait, but that would be for the reaction: H2(g) + 1/2 Cl2(g) + ... Hmm, perhaps it's better to approach this by writing the formation reactions.

Formation reactions for each substance:

AgCl(s): Ag(s) + 1/2 Cl2(g) → AgCl(s); ΔG_f° = -109.7 kJ/mol.

H2O(l): H2(g) + 1/2 O2(g) → H2O(l); ΔG_f°= -237.2 kJ/mol.

H3O+(aq) + Cl^-(aq): Let's consider the formation of H3O+ and Cl^- from their elements.

H3O+ is H+ in water, but the formation from H2 and O2 would be something like:

1/2 H2(g) + 1/2 O2(g) → H3O+(aq) + ... Hmm, perhaps it's better to think about the formation of H+ and Cl^-.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The problem says that the ΔG_f° for (H3O+ + Cl^-)(aq) is -368.4 kJ per mole. So for each mole of H3O+ and Cl^- produced, the ΔG_f is -368.4 kJ.

Wait, but since each H3O+ and Cl^- is one mole each, perhaps the reaction is:

H2(g) + 1/2 Cl2(g) + ... Hmm, perhaps the formation of H3O+ and Cl^- would involve the elements hydrogen, chlorine, and oxygen. But I'm getting stuck. Let me think differently.

Let me compute ΔG° for the reaction as the sum of products' ΔG_f° minus reactants'.

So the reaction is:

H₂(g) + 2 AgCl(s) + 2 H₂O(l) → 2 Ag(s) + 2 H₃O⁺(aq) + 2 Cl⁻(aq)

So let's list the standard Gibbs free energy of formation (ΔG_f°) for each substance.

Reactants:
- H₂(g): 0 kJ/mol
- 2 AgCl(s): 2 * (-109.7) = -219.4 kJ
- 2 H₂O(l): 2*(-237.2) = -474.4 kJ
Total ΔG_f°(reactants) = 0 -219.4 -474.4 = -693.8 kJ

Products:
- 2 Ag(s): 0 (since elements in standard form)
- 2 H₃O⁺(aq): 2*(-368.4)/2? Wait, wait, the given ΔG_f° is for (H3O+ + Cl^-) as a pair. So for each mole of H3O+ and Cl^- produced, it's -368.4 kJ. So in the products, we have 2 H3O+ and 2 Cl^-, meaning 2 moles of the (H3O+ + Cl^-) pair. So the total for this is 2*(-368.4) = -736.8 kJ.

Wait, but wait. If the given ΔG_f° is for the combination of H3O+ and Cl^- in aq, then each mole of H3O+ and Cl^- together contributes -368.4 kJ. So in the products, we have 2 moles of H3O+ and 2 moles of Cl^-, which is 2 moles of the pair, so 2*(-368.4) = -736.8 kJ.

So the total ΔG_f° for products is 0 (Ag) + (-736.8) = -736.8 kJ.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, maybe the given ΔG_f° is per mole of H3O+ and Cl^- each. So for one mole of each, it's -368.4 kJ. Then for two moles each, it's 2*(-368.4) = -736.8 kJ. So that's correct.

So ΔG° reaction is [sum products] - [sum reactants] = (-736.8) - (-693.8) = (-736.8 + 693.8) = -43.0 kJ. So ΔG° is -43,000 J (since 1 kJ is 1000 J).

Now, ΔG° is related to the standard cell potential E° by ΔG° = -n F E°.

We need to find n, the number of moles of electrons transferred. Let's look at the reaction to find n.

Breaking the reaction into half-reactions:

The oxidation and reduction processes.

Looking at AgCl: it's going from AgCl(s) to Ag(s) and Cl^-.

In AgCl, Ag is +1 oxidation state (since Cl is -1). So when AgCl(s) is reduced, Ag^+ is deposited as Ag(s), which is a reduction. So each AgCl contributes one electron gained per Ag.

So the reduction half-reaction is: AgCl(s) + e^- → Ag(s) + Cl^-.

But wait, in the overall reaction, 2 moles of AgCl are consumed, producing 2 moles of Ag and 2 Cl^-.

So each mole of AgCl gives one mole of e^- gained. So for 2 moles, 2 electrons are gained. So the total electrons transferred in reduction is 2.

But wait, in the overall reaction, H₂ is a reactant. H₂ is being oxidized. Let me check: H₂(g) is on the reactant side, and in the products, we have H3O^+ ions. So the oxidation of H₂ to H3O+.

H₂ → 2 H3O+ + 2 e^-

Wait, each H in H₂ is 0 oxidation state. In H3O+, H is +1. So each H atom loses one electron, so each H₂ molecule (2 H atoms) loses 2 electrons. So the oxidation half-reaction is: H₂ → 2 H3O+ + 2 e^-

So in the overall reaction, H₂ is oxidized, losing 2 electrons. The AgCl is reduced, gaining 2 electrons (2 moles, each gaining 1 e^-). So the number of electrons transferred (n) is 2.

So n = 2.

Now, E° can be calculated from ΔG° = -n F E°.

ΔG° is -43,000 J.

So, -43000 J = -n F E° → E° = (43000 J) / (n F).

n is 2, F is 96485 C/mol.

So E° = 43000 / (2 * 96485) → Let me compute that.

43000 divided by (2 * 96485) = 43000 / 192970 ≈ 0.2228 volts.

Wait, let me compute more accurately:

192970 = 2 * 96485 = 192970.

43000 / 192970 = Let me do the division:

192970 * 0.2228 ≈ 43000.

Yes, so E° is approximately 0.2228 volts.

Wait, but wait a second—because the reaction as written involves H₂ gas. So the standard cell potential would be under standard conditions, which for H₂ is 1 atm and activity 1. But in this problem, the activities aren't all standard. So E° is 0.2228 V, but the actual E under non-standard conditions will be different.

Now, to find the actual cell voltage E, we use the Nernst equation.

The Nernst equation is E = E° - (0.05916/n) * log Q.

Wait, but let me double-check: Q is the reaction quotient, calculated using the activities of the species as they are in the reaction.

The reaction is:

H₂(g) + 2 AgCl(s) + 2 H₂O(l) → 2 Ag(s) + 2 H₃O⁺(aq) + 2 Cl⁻(aq)

The reaction quotient Q is [products]/[reactants], but only for the aqueous and gaseous species. Solids and pure liquids don't contribute.

So, in Q:

[H₂] is the activity of H₂(g), which is given as 1.

For the products, H3O+ and Cl^- each have activities of 0.01. So their concentrations are 0.01 M each.

So Q = ( [H3O+]^2 [Cl^-]^2 ) / ( [H₂] )

Wait, but wait, the stoichiometry for H3O+ and Cl^- is 2 each. So Q is ( (0.01)^2 * (0.01)^2 ) / (1) ) = (0.01)^4 / 1 = 1e-8.

Wait, wait—no. Let me see:

The products are 2 H3O+ and 2 Cl^-; each has activity 0.01. So each is squared. So [H3O+]^2 is (0.01)^2, same for Cl^-.

So Q = [ (0.01)^2 * (0.01)^2 ] / [1] = (0.01)^4 = 1e-8.

Wait, wait—the reaction is written as producing 2 H3O+ and 2 Cl^-. So in Q, each is raised to the power of 2. So:

Q = ( ( [H3O+] )^2 * ( [Cl^-] )^2 ) / ( [H₂] )

So substituting the values:

[ H3O+ ] = 0.01, [ Cl^- ] = 0.01, [ H₂ ] = 1.

So Q = ( (0.01)^2 * (0.01)^2 ) / 1 = (1e-4) * (1e-4) = 1e-8.

Wait, 0.01 is 1e-2, squared is 1e-4. So two factors of 1e-4, multiplied gives 1e-8.

So log Q = log(1e-8) = -8.

Now, plug into the Nernst equation:

E = E° - (0.05916 / n) * log Q.

Here, E° is approximately 0.2228 V, n is 2.

So:

E = 0.2228 V - (0.05916 / 2) * (-8)

Because log Q is -8.

Compute (0.05916 / 2) = 0.02958.

Then, 0.02958 * (-8) = -0.23664.

But since it's minus this term, it becomes plus 0.23664.

So E = 0.2228 + 0.23664 ≈ 0.45944 V.

Wait, that's approximately 0.459 V.

Looking at the options, option F is 0.459 V.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

So steps:

1. Calculate ΔG° for the reaction: sum products - sum reactants.

Products: 2*(Ag) and 2*(H3O+ + Cl^-). Ag is 0, 2*(−368.4) = -736.8 kJ.

Reactants: H₂ (0) + 2*(−109.7) + 2*(−237.2) → 0 -219.4 -474.4 = -693.8 kJ.

ΔG° = (-736.8) - (-693.8) = -43 kJ → -43000 J.

2. ΔG° = -n F E° → E° = (43000) / (n * F). n is 2.

E° = 43000 / (2 * 96485) ≈ 0.2228 V.

3. Nernst equation:

Q = [H3O+]² [Cl^-]² / [H₂] = (0.01²) * (0.01²) / 1 = (1e-4)^2 = 1e-8.

log Q = -8.

E = E° - (0.05916 / n) * log Q → 0.2228 - (0.05916/2)*(-8).

Compute (0.05916/2) = 0.02958. Multiply by -8 → -0.23664. So the term becomes +0.23664.

So E = 0.2228 + 0.23664 ≈ 0.4594 V.

Which matches option F: 0.459v.

So the answer should be F.
