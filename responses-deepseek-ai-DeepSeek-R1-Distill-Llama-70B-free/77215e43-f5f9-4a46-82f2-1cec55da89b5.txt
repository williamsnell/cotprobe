Okay, so I have this problem about finding the upward velocity of a satellite at a specific time t=1. The satellite's path is given by parametric equations. Hmm, I remember that velocity in parametric equations is found by taking derivatives of the position functions with respect to time. So the velocity components would be the derivatives of x and y with respect to t.

The given equations are x = 4 cos(t) + cos(12t) and y = 4 sin(t) + sin(12t). I need to find the upward velocity, which I think refers to the y-component of the velocity at t=1.

Right, so first I'll find the derivatives dx/dt and dy/dt. Let's start with dy/dt because that's the one we'll need for the upward velocity.

For dy/dt, differentiate y with respect to t. The derivative of sin(t) is cos(t), and the derivative of sin(12t) is 12 cos(12t) because of the chain rule. So dy/dt = 4 cos(t) + 12 cos(12t).

Wait, no, wait. Let me make sure. The derivative of 4 sin(t) is 4 cos(t) multiplied by the derivative of t, which is 1. So yeah, that's 4 cos(t). And for sin(12t), the derivative is cos(12t) multiplied by 12, so 12 cos(12t). So dy/dt is 4 cos(t) + 12 cos(12t).

Now I need to evaluate this derivative at t=1. So I'll plug t=1 into the expression.

So dy/dt at t=1 is 4 cos(1) + 12 cos(12*1) = 4 cos(1) + 12 cos(12).

Wait, but wait—cos(12) is in radians, right? Because in calculus, we usually use radians unless specified otherwise.

Hmm, I think that's correct. So I'll calculate each term separately.

First, let's compute cos(1). 1 radian is about 57 degrees. Cos(1) is approximately 0.5403. So 4 * 0.5403 is about 2.1612.

Next, cos(12 radians). Wait, 12 radians is a lot—like, 12 radians is about 687 degrees because 2π radians is 360 degrees (since π is about 3.1416, 2π is 6.2832). So 12 radians is almost two full circles (which is 12/(2π) ≈ 1.9099, so 1.9099 * 360 ≈ 687 degrees). The cosine of 12 radians would be the same as cos(12 - 2π*1) = cos(12 - 6.2832) = cos(5.7168). Wait, 5.7168 is still more than 2π, which is 6.2832. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to just compute it numerically.

Alternatively, maybe just compute cos(12) using a calculator. Let me think: cos(12) is approximately cos(12) ≈ -0.8439. Wait, let me check that again. Let me calculate 12 radians: 12 radians.

Wait, perhaps I should use a calculator for exact values. So cos(12) is approximately cos(12) ≈ -0.8439. So 12 * (-0.8439) is about -10.1268.

So adding the two terms: 2.1612 + (-10.1268) = -7.9656. Wait, but that's a negative value. But the question asks for the upward velocity. Velocity can be negative, but perhaps I made a mistake in the sign.

Wait, wait a minute. Let me double-check the calculations. Because 12 radians is a lot, but let's confirm the cosine of 12 radians.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 12 mod 2π to get the equivalent angle between 0 and 2π. 12 divided by 2π is approximately 1.9099. So 12 = 2π * 1.9099. So 12 radians is 1 full rotation (2π) plus 0.9099 * 2π. 0.9099 * 2π ≈ 5.7165 radians.

So cos(12) = cos(5.7165). Now, 5.7165 radians is between 3π/2 (≈4.7124) and 2π (≈6.2832). So in the fourth quadrant, where cosine is positive. Wait, but earlier I thought cos(12) was negative. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait. Let me compute it more accurately. Let me compute 12 radians. Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator, but since I can't, I'll have to think.

Wait, 2π is about 6.2832. 12 radians is 12 - 2*2π = 12 - 12.5664 ≈ -0.5664. So cos(12) = cos(-0.5664) = cos(0.5664), because cosine is even. Cos(0.5664) is approximately 0.8439. So cos(12) ≈ 0.8439.

Wait, that can't be right because when I thought about 12 radians as 5.7165 (which is 12 mod 2π), then cos(5.7165) should be the same as cos(12). So 5.7165 is in the fourth quadrant, which is between 3π/2 (4.7124) and 2π (6.2832). So in the fourth quadrant, the cosine is positive. So cos(5.7165) is positive. So perhaps earlier, I was wrong when I thought it was negative.

Wait, but perhaps I should just proceed. Let's compute cos(1) and cos(12) accurately.

Let me use approximate values:

cos(1) ≈ 0.5403.

cos(12) is cos(12 - 2π * 1) because 2π is about 6.283, so 12 - 6.283 ≈ 5.717 radians. Now, 5.717 is 5.717 - 2π (6.283) is negative, so perhaps I should compute 5.717.

Wait, wait, 5.717 radians is equivalent to 5.717 - 2π ≈ 5.717 - 6.283 ≈ -0.566 radians. But cosine is even, so cos(5.717) = cos(-0.566) = cos(0.566) ≈ 0.8439.

So cos(12) ≈ 0.8439.

So, 12 * cos(12) is 12 * 0.8439 ≈ 10.1268.

So now, dy/dt at t=1 is 4 cos(1) + 12 cos(12) = 4*(0.5403) + 12*(0.8439).

Calculating each term:

4 * 0.5403 ≈ 2.1612.

12 * 0.8439 ≈ 10.1268.

Adding them: 2.1612 + 10.1268 = 12.288.

Wait, but that's a positive value. So the upward velocity is 12.288...? But looking at the options, option I is 12.287, which is very close.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake in the angle reduction.

Wait, when I have cos(12), 12 radians is 12 - 2π*1 = 12 - 6.283 ≈ 5.717 radians. Now, 5.717 is greater than π (3.1416) but less than 2π. So 5.717 is in the fourth quadrant, where cosine is positive. So yes, cos(5.717) is positive.

But another approach: perhaps using the calculator function, but since I can't, perhaps I should think about the actual value.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign earlier. Let me recompute cos(12). Alternatively, perhaps use the Taylor series for cosine around 0.

Wait, that's probably too time-consuming. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating 12 mod 2π.

Wait, 2π is approximately 6.2832. So 12 / 6.2832 ≈ 1.9099. So the integer part is 1, so 12 - 1 * 2π = 12 - 6.2832 ≈ 5.7168 radians. So 5.7168 radians is the angle within 0 to 2π.

Now, 5.7168 - 2π is 5.7168 -6.2832 = -0.5664 radians. So cos(5.7168) = cos(-0.5664) = cos(0.5664) ≈ 0.8439.

Wait, that's correct. So 12 cos(12) ≈ 12 * 0.8439 ≈ 10.1268.

So dy/dt at t=1 is 4*(0.5403) + 12*(0.8439) ≈ 2.1612 + 10.1268 ≈ 12.288.

Looking at the options, option I is 12.287, which is very close. So probably that's the correct answer.

Wait, but I should double-check. Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate using more precise values.

Let me compute cos(1) more accurately. Using calculator-like precision:

cos(1 radian) ≈ 0.54030230586.

Then 4 * 0.54030230586 ≈ 2.1612092234.

Now, cos(12) as we found is approximately 0.8439039026.

So 12 * 0.8439039026 ≈ 10.126843227.

Adding 2.1612092234 + 10.126843227 ≈ 12.28805245.

So approximately 12.288, which matches option I: 12.287.

Wait, but the options don't have exactly 12.288. Option I is 12.287, which is very close, probably due to rounding.

But wait, let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation because the given parametric equations include both cos(t) and cos(12t), and their derivatives. Did I correctly compute the derivative?

Yes. The derivative of cos(12t) is -12 sin(12t), wait wait wait. Oh no, wait a second! Oh no, I think I made a mistake here. Because I was calculating dy/dt as 4 cos(t) + 12 cos(12t), but wait the derivative of sin(12t) is 12 cos(12t), so that's correct. Wait, no: the derivative of sin(u) is cos(u) times u', so for sin(12t), that's 12 cos(12t).

Wait, but wait, in the y equation, it's 4 sin(t) + sin(12t). So the derivative is 4 cos(t) + 12 cos(12t). So that part is correct.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake in the evaluation of cos(12) as positive. Let me re-examine that.

Wait, 12 radians is 12/(2π) full circles, which is approximately 1.9099. So 12 radians is 1 full circle plus 0.9099*2π radians. 0.9099 * 2π ≈ 5.7165 radians. So 5.7165 is in the fourth quadrant, where cosine is positive. So cos(5.7165) is positive.

So cos(12) is positive and approximately 0.8439.

So then the calculation is correct, and the upward velocity is approximately 12.288, matching option I.

Wait, but looking at the options, option I is 12.287, which is very close. So that must be the answer.

Wait, but why are the other options so different? Let me see if I messed up the calculation somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I confused the x and y derivatives. Let me check.

x = 4 cos(t) + cos(12t). So dx/dt = -4 sin(t) -12 sin(12t).

y = 4 sin(t) + sin(12t). So dy/dt = 4 cos(t) + 12 cos(12t). So that's correct.

So the upward velocity is dy/dt at t=1, which is 4 cos(1) + 12 cos(12). As calculated, that's about 12.288, which is option I.

But wait, some of the other options are negative, but velocity can be negative, which would imply direction, but the question asks for the upward velocity, so perhaps the magnitude. But no, velocity is a vector, so it can be positive or negative. Wait, but in this case, the calculation gives a positive value, which would mean upward direction. So if the value is positive, then it's correct.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the sign of the derivative. Let me double-check.

Wait, the derivative of sin(t) is cos(t), correct. The derivative of sin(12t) is 12 cos(12t), correct. So dy/dt is 4 cos(t) + 12 cos(12t), which is correct.

So everything seems correct, and the answer should be approximately 12.287, which is option I.

To determine the upward velocity of the satellite at \( t = 1 \), we start with the given parametric equations:

\[
x = 4 \cos(t) + \cos(12t), \quad y = 4 \sin(t) + \sin(12t).
\]

The upward velocity corresponds to the \( y \)-component of the velocity, which is the derivative of \( y \) with respect to \( t \). Differentiating \( y \) gives:

\[
\frac{dy}{dt} = 4 \cos(t) + 12 \cos(12t).
\]

Next, we evaluate \( \frac{dy}{dt} \) at \( t = 1 \):

\[
\frac{dy}{dt}\Big|_{t=1} = 4 \cos(1) + 12 \cos(12).
\]

Using approximations for the cosine values:
- \( \cos(1) \approx 0.5403 \),
- \( \cos(12) \approx 0.8439 \) (after accounting for periodicity and reducing \( 12 \) radians modulo \( 2\pi \)).

Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{dy}{dt}\Big|_{t=1} = 4(0.5403) + 12(0.8439).
\]

Calculating each term:
- \( 4(0.5403) \approx 2.1612 \),
- \( 12(0.8439) \approx 10.1268 \).

Adding these together:

\[
\frac{dy}{dt}\Big|_{t=1} \approx 2.1612 + 10.1268 = 12.288.
\]

This value is very close to option \( I \), which is \( 12.287 \). The slight discrepancy is likely due to rounding differences. Therefore, the upward velocity at \( t = 1 \) is approximately \( 12.287 \).
