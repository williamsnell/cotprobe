Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about PLDs, which I think stands for Programmable Logic Devices. Hmm, the question is asking about a combinational PLD with a fixed AND array and a programmable OR array. I need to figure out what that's called.

Wait, let me remember. I think PLDs are a category of integrated circuits that can be programmed to perform specific logic functions. There are different types like PROM, PAL, PLA, etc. 

So the question is about a specific type. The key here is the structure: fixed AND array and programmable OR array. From what I remember, in digital electronics, combinational logic can be implemented using sum of products (SOP) or product of sums (POS) forms. 

A PLA, which stands for Programmable Logic Array, uses both programmable AND and OR arrays. Because it has both, it's more flexible but also more complex. Then there's the PAL, Programmable Array Logic, which I think has a fixed AND array and programmable OR array. Oh right, because PALs are based on the sum of products approach. The AND terms are fixed, but the OR array is programmable, meaning you can decide which AND terms to combine.

So the question describes a PLA or PAL. Wait, no, because PLA has both programmable, so if the question says fixed AND and programmable OR, that sounds like a PAL. 

Wait, but the question is about a combinational PLD. PALs are used for combinational logic. PLA can handle both combinational and sequential if it has flip-flops, but maybe the question isn't getting into that.

Wait, let me think again. The structure: fixed AND (so the AND gates are predefined) and programmable OR (so the connections between AND terms to form the outputs are programmable). That matches PAL. Because in PAL, the AND array is fixed, meaning the number of terms is set, but the OR array is programmable, so you can choose which terms go into each OR gate.

So the correct answer should be F: PAL.

Let me double-check the options. The options are A through J. The options given are:

A: ROM (Read Only Memory) – not a PLD, more like a memory chip.

B: FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) – much more complex and not what's described.

C: PLA – has programmable AND and OR arrays.

D: PLD – general term, but the question is about a specific type.

E: EEPROM – a type of memory.

F: PAL – yes, matches the description.

G: RAM – memory, not a PLD.

H: PROM – programmable ROM, but not a logic array.

I: CPLD – Complex PLD, which is a more advanced version, but the description doesn't fit.

J: ASIC – Application-Specific Integrated Circuit, custom-made, not programmable in the same way.

So yeah, the answer is F: PAL.

The question asks about a combinational PLD with a fixed AND array and a programmable OR array. To determine the correct answer, it's important to analyze the characteristics of each option:

- **A: ROM**: This is Read Only Memory, not a PLD, and does not match the description.
- **B: FPGA**: Field-Programmable Gate Arrays are highly complex devices, not fitting the specific structure described.
- **C: PLA**: Programmable Logic Arrays have both programmable AND and OR arrays, which does not match the fixed AND array described.
- **D: PLD**: This is a general term for Programmable Logic Devices, but the question asks for a specific type.
- **E: EEPROM**: This is a type of memory, not a PLD.
- **F: PAL**: Programmable Array Logic devices have a fixed AND array and a programmable OR array, exactly matching the description.
- **G: RAM**: Random Access Memory is a type of computer memory, not a PLD.
- **H: PROM**: Programmable Read Only Memory is not a logic array and does not fit the description.
- **I: CPLD**: Complex Programmable Logic Devices are more advanced than what is described in the question.
- **J: ASIC**: Application-Specific Integrated Circuits are custom-designed and not programmable in the same way as PLDs.

The correct answer is **F: PAL**, as it matches the description of a combinational PLD with a fixed AND array and a programmable OR array.

Answer: F
