Okay, so I've got this question here about the percentage of the population in South Sudan that had access to electricity in 2016. Hmm, I'm not too sure about the exact number, but I can try to think it through.

First, I remember that South Sudan is one of the younger countries in Africa, having gained independence in 2011. From what I've heard, they've faced a lot of challenges, including political instability and economic struggles. Because of that, I wouldn't expect their infrastructure to be very developed, especially in rural areas.

Electricity access is often a good indicator of a country's development. Countries with lower development usually have lower access rates. I think in Sub-Saharan Africa, the average access to electricity is around 40-50% or so, but that's just a rough estimate. South Sudan, being one of the less developed countries, might be on the lower end of that spectrum.

Wait, but I'm trying to recall specific data. I think I've read somewhere that in South Sudan, less than a third of the population has access to electricity. That would put it somewhere in the teens or maybe low twenties. But I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's around 20-30%?

Looking at the options, the choices are A:79%, B:49%, C:69%, D:9%, E:59%, F:39%, G:19%, H:29%, I:89%, J:99%. So the lower options are D (9%) and G (19%), H is 29%.

I think 9% seems really low, even for South Sudan. Maybe around 20%? But I'm not sure if it's exactly 19% or 29%. Alternatively, perhaps it's much lower because of the ongoing conflicts and displacement of people. After all, if the country was in turmoil, infrastructure might not have been developed much, leading to very low access.

Wait, I think I remember a specific report saying that in 2016, only about 1 in 10 people in South Sudan had access to electricity. That would be around 10%, which is close to option D:9%. But then again, sometimes these numbers can vary based on sources. Another thought: maybe urban areas have more access, but the majority live in rural areas where access is almost non-existent.

So if the country's overall access is around 10%, then D:9% would be the correct answer. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes these statistics might include both urban and rural, and perhaps the number is slightly higher. I've also heard that in some of the most underdeveloped countries, electricity access can be as low as 5-15%, so 9% fits within that range.

Alternatively, maybe it's higher. I think in some cases, even in conflict-affected countries, the capital city might have a bit more access, so the national average could be a bit higher. So if the capital Juba has, say, 30% access, and the rest of the country much lower, maybe the average is around 15-20%. But 19% is one of the options, which is G.

Wait, another angle: the World Bank data. I think they have statistics on electricity access. From what I recall, in 2016, South Sudan had one of the lowest access rates. I think it was around 9%, which would match option D. But I'm not 100% sure; sometimes the numbers can be a bit higher when considering off-grid solutions, but in South Sudan, even those might be limited.

Considering all that, I'm leaning towards D:9% as the correct answer.

The correct answer is D: 9%.
