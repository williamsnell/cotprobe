Okay, so I've got this question here about Wellman's argument related to property rights. The question is a bit tricky, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me think about what I know on this topic.

Alright, the question says: Wellman argues that insisting on unlimited property rights commits one to... and then there are several options. The options are A through J, each representing a different political or ethical theory.

First, I need to understand what each of these options means because that will help me figure out the correct answer.

Option A is anarchy. Anarchy is a society without a central government, where individuals are free to do as they wish without external authority. I remember that some anarchists do emphasize property rights, but others, especially anarcho-communists, don't. So it's a bit mixed.

Option B is deontological theory. Deontology is about duties and rules, right? Like, following certain moral rules regardless of the outcome. I'm not sure how that directly ties to unlimited property rights, but maybe Wellman connects it somehow.

Option C is libertarianism. Libertarianism definitely comes to mind when thinking about property rights. Libertarians believe in minimal government intervention and strong individual rights, including property. In fact, I think libertarian philosophy often argues for extensive property rights, so this could be a possible choice.

Option D is communitarianism. Communitarians focus on community and collective good over individual rights. They might argue against unlimited property rights because they could harm the community. So this seems opposite of what the question is asking.

Option E is socialism. Socialists usually advocate for more collective ownership and regulation of property, so unlimited property rights would go against socialist principles. So this is probably not the answer.

Option F is egalitarianism. Egalitarians believe in equality, often promoting equal distribution of resources. Unlimited property rights might conflict with that, so I don't think this is the right choice.

Option G is utilitarianism. Utilitarianism is about maximizing overall happiness or utility. Property rights could be evaluated based on whether they lead to the greatest good. But I'm not sure if Wellman is linking it directly to utilitarianism.

Option H is consequentialism. Consequentialism is similar to utilitarianism in that it focuses on the outcomes of actions. So if unlimited property rights lead to certain consequences, that's what matters. But again, not directly sure about the connection here.

Option I is capitalism. Capitalism is an economic system that relies heavily on private property. So if someone insists on unlimited property rights, they might be supporting capitalist principles. That makes sense as a possible answer.

Option J is authoritarianism. Authoritarianism is about strong central authority and control. I'm not sure how that ties directly to property rights; maybe in some systems, but it doesn't seem like the direct link the question is pointing to.

Now, going back to the question. Wellman's argument is about the implications of insisting on unlimited property rights. I think Wellman's work, as I recall, discusses how such a stance often leads to a particular political philosophy. Libertarianism is all about individual rights, including property, so that seems like a strong candidate. Also, capitalism is about private property, but I'm trying to remember if Wellman specifically ties it to capitalism or to libertarianism.

Wait, Wellman might argue that unlimited property rights lead to libertarianism because libertarians advocate for minimal government and maximal individual rights, including property. Capitalism is more of an economic system, while libertarianism is a political philosophy. So the commitment would be to libertarianism rather than capitalism.

Alternatively, I'm a bit confused because both C and I could be related. Let me think again. The question is about what one is committed to by insisting on unlimited property rights. Libertarianism is a political theory that emphasizes individual rights and freedoms, including property. So I think the answer is C: libertarianism.

But wait, I'm not 100% certain. Another angle: some might say that unlimited property rights are a cornerstone of capitalism, so maybe I is the answer. However, I think Wellman's point is more about the philosophical commitment to individual rights, which is libertarianism. Capitalism is more about the economic system, while libertarianism is the broader political philosophy.

So, I'm leaning towards option C: libertarianism.

Wellman argues that insisting on unlimited property rights commits one to libertarianism. Libertarianism is a political philosophy that emphasizes individual rights and freedoms, including strong property rights, and advocates for minimal government intervention. While capitalism is an economic system that also relies on private property, the question focuses on the philosophical commitment, making libertarianism the more precise answer.

Answer: C
