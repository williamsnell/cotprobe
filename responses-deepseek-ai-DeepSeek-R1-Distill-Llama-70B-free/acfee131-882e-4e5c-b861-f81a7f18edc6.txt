Okay, so I've got this question about the translational partition function for argon gas. Hmm, I remember that the partition function is a statistical mechanics concept, right? It tells us about the distribution of particles over various states. 

The question says that gaseous Ar is at 298 K and confined to a two-dimensional plane with an area of 1.00 cm². I need to find the translational partition function. I think the formula for the translational partition function in two dimensions is different from the three-dimensional case. 

Wait, in three dimensions, the translational partition function is given by q = (V)(sqrt(2πmkT/h²))³, where V is volume. But here it's two-dimensional, so maybe the formula is q = (A)(sqrt(2πmkT/h²))²? Because in 2D, it's area instead of volume. Or wait, maybe the formula is (A/(λ²)), where λ is the thermal wavelength. Or was that for 3D? I'm a bit confused. 

Oh right, the thermal wavelength λ is given by h / sqrt(2πmkT). So for each direction, maybe. In two dimensions, the partition function would involve λ in x and y directions. 

Wait, I think the general formula for the translational partition function in n dimensions is q = (Area) * (sqrt(2πmkT/h²))^n. But wait, no, that might not be exactly right. Alternatively, I remember that in 2D, the translational partition function is (A) * (2πmkT/h²). Because in 1D it's L * sqrt(2πmkT/h²), so in 2D it's Lx * Ly * (sqrt(...))²? Or wait, maybe it's (A) * (sqrt(2πmkT/h²))^2. Let me think.

Let me get the exact formula. The translational partition function in two dimensions should be q_trans = (A) * (2πmkT/h²). Because in 1D, q is L * sqrt(2πmkT/h²). So in 2D, it's the product for x and y directions. So the product would be (Lx * Ly) [which is the area A] multiplied by (sqrt(...))², which is 2πmkT/h². So yeah, q_trans = A*(2πmkT/h²).

Alternatively, another approach: λ is the thermal wavelength, which in 2D would be relevant as well. So the partition function is (A) / (λ²). Because in 3D, it's V/λ³. So in 2D, it's A/(λ²). 

Wait, that makes sense. So for 2D, q = A/(λ²). Since λ = h / sqrt(2πmkT), λ squared is h²/(2πmkT). So 1/λ² is (2πmkT)/h². So q = A*(2πmkT)/h².

Yes, that seems right. So I can calculate it using either approach. Let me proceed with this formula.

Now, I'll need the values of the constants and the mass of argon.

Mass of argon: Ar has a molar mass of about 40 g/mol. So per molecule, it's 40 g/mol divided by Avogadro's number. Let me compute that.

Molar mass M = 40 g/mol = 0.040 kg/mol. 
Avogadro's number N_A = 6.022e23 mol⁻¹.
So mass m = M / N_A = 0.040 kg/mol / 6.022e23 mol⁻¹ = 6.642e-26 kg.

Wait, did I get that right? Let me calculate 0.040 / 6.022e23. 0.040 is 4e-2. So 4e-2 / 6.022e23 = approximately 6.64e-26 kg. Yes.

Next, the temperature T is 298 K. 

Planck constant h is 6.626e-34 J·s. 

Boltzmann constant k is 1.381e-23 J/K.

So plugging in the values:

q = A * (2π m k T) / h².

First, compute the numerator: 2 * π * m * k * T.

Let me compute each part step by step.

Compute 2π:
2π ≈ 6.2832.

Compute m:
6.642e-26 kg.

Compute k:
1.381e-23 J/K.

Compute T:
298 K.

So numerator = 6.2832 * 6.642e-26 kg * 1.381e-23 J/K * 298 K.

Let me compute this:

First, multiply 6.2832 * 6.642e-26 = let's see, 6 * 6.6 is about 39.6, so exact calculation:

6.2832 * 6.642e-26 = 

= (6 + 0.2832) * 6.642e-26
= 6 * 6.642e-26 + 0.2832 * 6.642e-26
= 3.9852e-25 + 1.883e-26
= approx 4.1733e-25.

Wait, maybe more accurately:

6.2832 * 6.642e-26 = 

6 *6.642e-26 = 3.9852e-25
0.2832 *6.642e-26 = 0.2832 *6.642 = approx 1.881e-26. So total is approx 3.9852e-25 + 1.881e-26 = 4.1733e-25.

Then multiply by 1.381e-23:

4.1733e-25 * 1.381e-23 = let's compute 4.1733 *1.381 = approx 5.77.

Exponents: 1e-25 * 1e-23 = 1e-48. So 5.77e-48.

Then multiply by 298 K:

5.77e-48 * 298 = approx 1.719e-45.

Wait, wait, because 5.77 * 298 = 5.77 *300 is 1731, minus 5.77 * 2=11.54 --> 1731-11.54=1719.46, which is 1.71946e3. So 5.77e-48 * 298 = 1.719e-45.

So numerator is approximately 1.719e-45 (kg·J/(K·s²)).

Wait, but J is kg·m²/s², so overall, the units might be getting a bit messy, but perhaps it's okay.

Now, the denominator is h squared: (6.626e-34 J·s)^2.

Compute h^2: (6.626e-34)^2 = (6.626)^2 * 1e-68 ≈ 43.91 * 1e-68 = 4.391e-67 J²·s².

Wait, but J is kg·m²/s², so J²·s² is (kg²·m^4/s^4) * s^2 = kg²·m^4/s².

So the denominator is 4.391e-67 J²·s².

Now, putting numerator and denominator together:

q = A * (numerator) / (denominator) 

Wait, no. Wait, the formula is q = A * (2π m k T) / h².

Wait, I think I messed up the order. Let me clarify. The (2π m k T) is the numerator, and h squared is the denominator. So the entire term is (2π m k T) / h², multiplied by A.

So the term (2π m k T/h²) is part of the calculation. So that's (numerator)/(denominator) = (1.719e-45) / (4.391e-67).

Let me compute that division: 1.719e-45 /4.391e-67 = (1.719 /4.391) * 1e22.

1.719 /4.391 ≈ 0.391.

So 0.391e22 = 3.91e21.

So the term (2π m k T/h²) is approximately 3.91e21.

Now, multiply by the area A, which is 1.00 cm². Wait, but I need to convert cm² to m² because the units in the constants are in SI units. 1 cm² is (0.01 m)^2 = 1e-4 m².

So A = 1e-4 m².

So q = A * (3.91e21 m^-2) ) ?

Wait, no, let me think about the units. Wait, the term (2π m k T/h²) has units of 1/(length squared), because when you look at h²/(m^2 k T) etc. Wait, perhaps I should double-check.

But in any case, let's compute the numerical value:

q = 1e-4 m² * 3.91e21 (m^-2) = 1e-4 * 3.91e21 = 3.91e17.

Wait, that's 3.91 times 10^17.

Looking at the options, option C is 3.9e17, which matches. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Let me re-calculate (2π m k T) / h².

m = 6.642e-26 kg.

Compute 2πmkT: 2 * π * 6.642e-26 kg * 1.381e-23 J/K * 298 K.

Wait, but J is kg·m²/s², so the units for 2πmkT would be kg*(kg·m²/s²/K)*K → kg²·m²/(s²·K) * K → kg²·m²/s².

Wait, perhaps better to focus on the numbers.

Compute the product step by step:

2 * π ≈ 6.2832.

6.2832 * 6.642e-26 = let's compute that:

6 *6.642e-26 = 3.985e-25.

0.2832 *6.642e-26 = approx 1.88e-26.

So sum is 3.985e-25 + 1.88e-26 = 4.173e-25.

Now, multiply by 1.381e-23:

4.173e-25 * 1.381e-23 → 4.173 *1.381 = approx 5.77, exponents 1e-25 *1e-23 = 1e-48 → 5.77e-48.

Multiply by 298:

5.77e-48 *298 = 1.719e-45.

Now, h² is (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67.

So (2πmkT)/h² = (1.719e-45) / (4.39e-67) = approximately 3.91e21 m^-2.

Multiply by area A =1 cm² =1e-4 m²:

3.91e21 *1e-4 =3.91e17.

Yes, so the partition function is ~3.91e17. The closest option is C: 3.9e17.

To calculate the translational partition function for gaseous argon (Ar) confined to a two-dimensional plane, we use the formula:

\[
q_{\text{trans}} = A \cdot \frac{2 \pi m k T}{h^2}
\]

where:
- \(A = 1.00 \, \text{cm}^2 = 1.00 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{m}^2\) (converted to SI units),
- \(m = \frac{0.040 \, \text{kg/mol}}{6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{mol}^{-1}} = 6.642 \times 10^{-26} \, \text{kg}\) (mass of one argon atom),
- \(k = 1.381 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K}\) (Boltzmann constant),
- \(T = 298 \, \text{K}\),
- \(h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\) (Planck constant).

### Step 1: Compute the numerator \(2 \pi m k T\)
\[
2 \pi m k T = 2 \cdot 3.1416 \cdot 6.642 \times 10^{-26} \cdot 1.381 \times 10^{-23} \cdot 298
\]
First, calculate \(2 \pi \cdot 6.642 \times 10^{-26}\):
\[
2 \pi \cdot 6.642 \times 10^{-26} = 4.173 \times 10^{-25}
\]
Next, multiply by \(1.381 \times 10^{-23}\):
\[
4.173 \times 10^{-25} \cdot 1.381 \times 10^{-23} = 5.77 \times 10^{-48}
\]
Finally, multiply by \(298\):
\[
5.77 \times 10^{-48} \cdot 298 = 1.719 \times 10^{-45}
\]

### Step 2: Compute the denominator \(h^2\)
\[
h^2 = (6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2 = 4.391 \times 10^{-67}
\]

### Step 3: Compute \(\frac{2 \pi m k T}{h^2}\)
\[
\frac{2 \pi m k T}{h^2} = \frac{1.719 \times 10^{-45}}{4.391 \times 10^{-67}} = 3.91 \times 10^{21} \, \text{m}^{-2}
\]

### Step 4: Multiply by the area \(A\)
\[
q_{\text{trans}} = A \cdot \frac{2 \pi m k T}{h^2} = 1.00 \times 10^{-4} \cdot 3.91 \times 10^{21} = 3.91 \times 10^{17}
\]

### Final Answer
The translational partition function is approximately \(3.9 \times 10^{17}\), which corresponds to **option C**.
