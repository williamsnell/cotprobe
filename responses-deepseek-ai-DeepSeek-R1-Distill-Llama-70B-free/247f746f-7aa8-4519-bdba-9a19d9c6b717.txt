Okay, so I have this question about the Intelligence Quotient, or IQ. I remember that IQ is a measure used to assess human intelligence, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. The question is asking me to pick the correct definition from the given options.

I think the traditional formula for IQ involves comparing the person's mental age to their chronological age. Wait, mental age is like the average age of people who perform similarly on the test. So the formula would be mental age divided by chronological age, multiplied by 100 to get a percentage. That makes sense because it standardizes the score around 100.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one matches that formula. Let's go through them:

Option A: chronological age divided by verbal score. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. IQ isn't about verbal score over age.

Option B: mental age over performance score. No, the denominator should be chronological age.

Option C: chronological age over performance score. Nope, that's the reverse of what I'm looking for.

Option D: verbal score over chronological age. Not quite. It's about mental age, not verbal score.

Option E: verbal over performance. Doesn't fit the formula I remember.

Option F: chronological age over mental age. Wait, that's the inverse of what I thought. So if the formula is mental age divided by chronological age, then option F is the opposite. So F would be (CA/MA)*100, which I don't think is correct because that would give a lower score if you're more intelligent but younger.

Option G: verbal over mental age. No, that's not the standard formula.

Option H: performance over verbal. Doesn't relate to the age comparison.

Option I: performance over mental age. Again, not the age ratio.

Option J: mental age over chronological age times 100. Oh wait, that's exactly what I was thinking earlier! So option J is (MA/CA)*100, which is the correct formula for IQ.

Wait a second, I should make sure I'm not confusing anything. Because sometimes I've heard that modern tests use a standard deviation approach instead, but the question is about the definition. The traditional formula is indeed MA/CA *100. So the correct answer should be option J.

The Intelligence Quotient (IQ) is traditionally defined as the ratio of mental age (MA) to chronological age (CA), multiplied by 100. This formula standardizes the score, with an average IQ set at 100. Among the given options, the correct one is:

**J: mental age/chronological age × 100**

Answer: J
