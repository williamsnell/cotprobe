Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about calculating the heat of reaction at 298 K using the given standard heats of formation. The reaction is between sodium oxide (Na₂O) and hydrochloric acid (HCl), producing sodium chloride (NaCl) and water (H₂O). The equation provided is:

Na₂O(s) + 2HCl(g) → 2NaCl(s) + H₂O(l)

The data given includes the standard heats of formation (ΔHf°) for each substance involved. I remember that the standard heat of reaction (ΔH°) can be calculated using Hess's Law, which involves the heats of formation of the products and reactants.

So, the formula I think I need to use is:

ΔH°(reaction) = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants)

Right, because you subtract the sum of the reactants' heats of formation from the products'.

Let me list out the ΔHf° values:

- Na₂O(s): -100.7 ± 1.2 kcal/mol
- HCl(g): -22.0 ± 1.0 kcal/mol (Wait, wait! Wait, no, wait. Oh, wait, wait a second. Wait, the problem says HCl(g) is +22.0? Or is it negative? Let me check the data again.

Looking back: The data says HCl(g) is 22.0 ±1.0 kcal/mol. So, positive. Because the standard heat of formation for elements in their standard state is zero. So compounds have their own values. So, Na₂O(s) is -100.7, HCl(g) is +22.0, NaCl(s) is -98.6, and H₂O(l) is -68.32.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, no, the standard heat of formation for HCl(g) is actually positive? Wait, that doesn't seem right. Typically, HCl formation is exothermic, so ΔHf° would be negative. Hmm. Maybe the data provided is using different conventions. Oh, wait, perhaps the problem states the values as given, so I have to go with that.

Wait, the data shows:

NaCl(s): -98.6 ±0.2 kcal/mole

Na₂O(s): -100.7 ±1.2 kcal/mole

HCl(g): +22.0 ±1.0 kcal/mole

H₂O(l): -68.32 ±0.01 kcal/mole

So it's as given. So I have to use these values as provided.

So the reaction is:

1 mole Na₂O(s) + 2 moles HCl(g) → 2 moles NaCl(s) + 1 mole H₂O(l)

So, applying the formula:

ΔH° = [2*(ΔHf NaCl) + 1*(ΔHf H2O)] - [1*(ΔHf Na2O) + 2*(ΔHf HCl)]

Plugging in the numbers:

= [2*(-98.6) + (-68.32)] - [ (-100.7) + 2*(22.0) ]

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, the products:

2*(-98.6) = -197.2

Plus (-68.32) gives:

-197.2 -68.32 = -265.52 kcal

Now the reactants:

-100.7 (from Na₂O) plus 2*(22.0) which is 44.0.

So, -100.7 +44.0 = -56.7 kcal

Wait, wait, no. Wait, the formula is products minus reactants. So:

ΔH° = (sum products) - (sum reactants)

So:

-265.52 - (-56.7) = ?

Wait, wait, wait. Let me be careful. The sum of products is -265.52. The sum of reactants is (-100.7) + (2*22.0) = (-100.7) +44.0 = -56.7.

So it's [products] - [reactants] = (-265.52) - (-56.7) = (-265.52 +56.7) = -208.82 kcal.

Hmm, that's what I get. Now, let me check the options to see which one matches.

Looking at the options:

Option H is -120.82 ±1.81 kcal.

Option F is -85.98 ±1.3 kcal.

Option E is -55.1 ±0.6.

Option D is 120.82, positive.

Wait, none of these match what I got. Hmm, maybe I made a calculation mistake.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the signs. Let me recheck.

Wait, the formula is products minus reactants.

Sum of products: 2*(-98.6) = -197.2, plus (-68.32) = total of -265.52.

Sum of reactants: (-100.7) for Na₂O, plus 2*(22.0) for HCl, which is 44. So sum is (-100.7 +44) = -56.7.

So ΔH° = (-265.52) - (-56.7) = -265.52 +56.7 = -208.82.

Wait, but none of the options are near that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the ΔHf for HCl is given as +22.0, but in reality, it's negative. Let me think. The standard heat of formation for HCl(g) is actually about -22 kcal/mol, but the problem says it's +22.0. So I have to proceed with the given data.

Wait, perhaps I did the products and reactants in the wrong way. Let me double-check the equation.

The equation is Na₂O + 2 HCl → 2 NaCl + H₂O.

So the products are 2 NaCl and H₂O, and the reactants are Na₂O and 2 HCl.

So in the formula, it's [ (2*NaCl) + H2O ] - [ Na2O + 2 HCl ].

Wait, maybe I should compute each part again.

Products:

2 * (-98.6) = -197.2

Plus (-68.32) → -265.52.

Reactants:

1 * (-100.7) → -100.7

Plus 2*(22.0) → 44.0.

Total reactants: -100.7 +44 = -56.7.

So ΔH° = (-265.52) - (-56.7) = -265.52 +56.7 = -208.82 kcal.

But looking at the options, the closest is option H: -120.82 kcal. That's not matching. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again.

Wait, wait! Wait a minute. Oh no, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum of products.

Wait, 2 moles of NaCl, each at -98.6. So 2*(-98.6) = -197.2. Plus 1 mole of H₂O at -68.32. So that's -197.2 -68.32 = -265.52.

Reactants: 1 mole Na₂O at -100.7, and 2 moles HCl at +22.0 each. So 2*22 = +44. So sum reactants: -100.7 +44 = -56.7.

So ΔH° = (-265.52) - (-56.7) = -265.52 +56.7 = -208.82.

Wait, but none of the answer options seem to match this. Did I make a mistake in the arithmetic?

Wait, 265.52 minus 56.7? Wait, wait no, it's -265.52 +56.7 = - (265.52 -56.7) = -208.82.

Hmm. So the correct ΔH° is -208.82 kcal.

Looking at the options, I don't see this value. So perhaps I made a mistake in reading the data. Let me check again.

Wait, the data shows:

NaCl(s): -98.6 ±0.2 kcal/mole

Na₂O(s): -100.7 ±1.2 kcal/mole

HCl(g): 22.0 ±1.0 kcal/mole

H₂O(l): -68.32 ±0.01 kcal/mole

Wait, perhaps the HCl value is positive, indicating an endothermic formation, which is unusual, but perhaps that's correct for the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied Hess's Law.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is written as it is, so perhaps I should double-check the stoichiometry.

The reaction is 1 Na₂O + 2 HCl → 2 NaCl + 1 H₂O.

Wait, so for the products, it's 2 moles NaCl and 1 mole H2O.

So the sum is 2*(-98.6) + (-68.32) = (-197.2) + (-68.32) = -265.52.

For the reactants, it's 1*(-100.7) + 2*(22.0) = (-100.7) +44 = -56.7.

So the ΔH° is products minus reactants: (-265.52) - (-56.7) = -208.82 kcal.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the reverse process. Or perhaps the reaction is written in the opposite direction.

Wait, the equation is written as Na₂O + 2 HCl → 2 NaCl + H₂O.

Wait, perhaps I should think about this as an exothermic reaction because the products have lower energy, but the calculation is giving a large negative value, but options don't have that.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option H is -120.82, which is about half of what I calculated. So perhaps I made an error in the number of moles.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I forgot to account for the sign in the heat of reaction. Wait, another approach: perhaps the heat of reaction is the sum of the heats of formation of the products minus the sum of the heats of formation of the reactants, each multiplied by their stoichiometric coefficients.

Wait, let's recalculate:

ΔH° = [ (2 * ΔHf NaCl) + (1 * ΔHf H2O) ] - [ (1 * ΔHf Na2O) + (2 * ΔHf HCl) ]

Plugging in numbers:

= [ 2*(-98.6) + (-68.32) ] - [ (-100.7) + 2*(22.0) ]

= [ (-197.2) + (-68.32) ] - [ (-100.7) + 44.0 ]

= ( -265.52 ) - ( -56.7 )

= -265.52 +56.7 = -208.82 kcal.

Wait, but perhaps the problem expects the answer to be per mole of reaction, which is correct as I did. So the value is -208.82 kcal.

Looking again at the options, none of them match. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the error propagation as well, but the question just asks for the heat of reaction, not the uncertainty. Wait, but the options include uncertainties. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should recheck the calculation steps. Let me do the arithmetic again.

Products:

2 * (-98.6) = -197.2.

1 * (-68.32) = -68.32.

Total products: -197.2 -68.32 = -265.52.

Reactants:

1 * (-100.7) = -100.7.

2 * (22.0) = +44. So sum reactants: -100.7 +44 = -56.7.

ΔH° = products - reactants = (-265.52) - (-56.7) = -265.52 +56.7 = (-265.52 +56.7).

Wait, 265.52 -56.7 is 208.82, so with the negative, it's -208.82.

Hmm, I'm stuck because the options don't have this value.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign of the HCl. Because if the ΔHf of HCl is positive, that's unusual. Normally, HCl's formation is exothermic, so the ΔHf would be negative. But the problem states it as +22.0.

Wait, perhaps the problem intended it to be -22.0, but mistyped it as positive. If that's the case, let's try recalculating with that assumption.

If ΔHf HCl(g) is -22.0:

Then sum reactants would be (-100.7) + 2*(-22.0) = -100.7 -44 = -144.7.

Then, ΔH° = [products] - [reactants] = (-265.52) - (-144.7) = (-265.52 +144.7) = -120.82 kcal.

Ah, that matches option H, which is -120.82 ±1.81 kcal.

But wait, the problem says HCl(g) is +22.0. So perhaps I should proceed with that. But then none of the options match, which is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let me check the reaction equation again.

The equation is Na2O(s) + 2HCl(g) → 2NaCl(s) + H2O(l).

Yes, that's correct. So 1 mole Na2O, 2 moles HCl, produces 2 moles NaCl and 1 mole H2O.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the heat of reaction is supposed to be per mole of Na2O. So the ΔH° would be -208.82 kcal per mole of Na2O, but the options don't have that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the question might have a typo in the data. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the correct answer isn't among the options, but that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I should try another approach. Let me calculate the sum again, but perhaps I mixed up the products and reactants.

Wait, the reaction is Na₂O + 2 HCl → 2 NaCl + H₂O.

So the products are NaCl and H₂O, and the reactants are Na₂O and HCl.

Thus, the formula is:

ΔH° = [sum ΔHf products] - [sum ΔHf reactants]

Which is [2*(-98.6) + (-68.32)] - [ (-100.7) + 2*(22.0) ]

So that's (-265.52) - (-56.7) = -208.82.

But the options don't include this. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption about the ΔHf of HCl.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the heat of reaction to be expressed per mole of HCl, but that doesn't make sense because the stoichiometry is based on Na₂O.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the problem is asking for the enthalpy change per mole of reaction as written, which is 1 mole of Na₂O. So the calculation is correct as -208.82 kcal per mole of Na₂O.

But again, the options don't have this value. So I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the products and reactants. Let me recompute.

Products:

2 * (-98.6) = -197.2

1 * (-68.32) = -68.32

Total: -197.2 -68.32 = -265.52.

Reactants:

1 * (-100.7) = -100.7

2 * (22.0) = +44.0

Sum: -100.7 +44 = -56.7.

So ΔH° = (-265.52) - (-56.7) = -208.82 kcal.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the problem gives the data for HCl as +22.0, but the actual value is negative, leading to a different result.

If I assume HCl's ΔHf is -22.0, then:

Sum reactants: (-100.7) + 2*(-22.0) = -100.7 -44 = -144.7.

ΔH° = (-265.52) - (-144.7) = -120.82 kcal.

Which matches option H.

But the problem states HCl's ΔHf as +22.0. So perhaps that's a mistake in the problem, or perhaps I'm misunderstanding.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be positive 120.82, but that's not the case because the reaction is exothermic.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is -120.82 kcal, which would make sense if the HCl's ΔHf was -22.0.

So perhaps the intended answer is option H, and the problem's data might have a typo. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed despite the confusion.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to look for a different approach. Wait, perhaps it's the standard enthalpy of neutralization. But no, that's a different concept.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the sum of the products and reactants.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is to calculate it per mole of HCl, but that doesn't make sense because the reaction is per mole of Na₂O and 2 moles of HCl.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check the units. The question says the heat of reaction is in kcal, which matches the data.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is -120.82 kcal, which is option H, and the problem's HCl ΔHf is a typo. So perhaps I should select option H.

But wait, the problem gives HCl as +22.0, which would lead to a different answer. So I'm torn here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the uncertainty as well. Let me try that.

The formula for error propagation when adding and subtracting is to add the uncertainties in quadrature when it's a sum or difference.

So, each term's uncertainty is given. Let's calculate the uncertainty for the products and reactants.

For products:

2 moles NaCl: 2 * 0.2 = 0.4 kcal.

1 mole H2O: 0.01 kcal.

Total uncertainty for products: sqrt( (0.4)^2 + (
