Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is about an SCR gate cathode characteristic, which I think has to do with the gate source resistance. Hmm, I remember that SCRs have gate characteristics where the voltage and current relate in a certain way, probably linear because it says it's a straight line. 

The problem gives a gate cathode characteristic as a straight line of 130. Wait, I'm not entirely sure what that means. Oh right, I think the gate cathode characteristic is usually given as a graph of gate current (Ig) against gate voltage (Vg), and the slope of that line represents something. Oh wait, maybe it's the inverse of the resistance? Like if the line is steep, the resistance is low. Or maybe the slope is the conductance, which is 1/resistance. 

So if the characteristic is a straight line of 130, perhaps that's the gate source resistance value, but no, wait. Because the gate cathode characteristic is Vg vs Ig, and the slope (dVg/dIg) would be the resistance. So if the line is 130, maybe that's the resistance in ohms? But wait, the options have 130 as option C. But the question is asking for the gate source resistance given some other parameters. So maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, the question states that the triggered source voltage is 15 V and the allowable gate power dissipation is 0.5 W. I need to compute the gate source resistance. Oh, okay, so we're probably using the power and voltage to find current, then use Ohm's law or something.

Let me think. The gate power dissipation is 0.5 W. Power is V squared over R, or I squared R, or V*I. Since the gate is being triggered, the voltage here is 15 V. So maybe the power is Vg squared divided by R. Because P = Vg^2 / R, solving for R would give R = Vg^2 / P.

Wait, let me check. Gate power dissipation would be the power the gate resistor is handling. So if the gate is supplied with a voltage Vg, and the resistance is R, then the current Ig is Vg/R. Then the power would be Ig^2 * R, which is (Vg^2 / R^2) * R = Vg^2 / R. So yes, P = Vg^2 / R. So R = Vg^2 / P.

Plugging in the numbers, Vg is 15 V, P is 0.5 W. So R = (15)^2 / 0.5 = 225 / 0.5 = 450 ohms. Wait, but none of the options are 450. Hmm, that can't be right. Did I make a mistake?

Wait a second, maybe I mixed up something. Oh wait, the gate cathode characteristic line is given as 130. Maybe that's the gate source resistance in ohms. But the options include 130, which is option C. But the problem is asking to compute it, so perhaps that 130 is a different value. Or maybe the 130 is the reciprocal of the resistance? No, that doesn't make sense because resistance is in ohms, and the line would have units of volts per ampere, which is ohms.

Wait, perhaps the gate cathode characteristic line has a slope of 130 ohms. So the gate source resistance is 130, but then why are they giving the other values? Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Alternatively, maybe the gate source resistance is determined by the power and voltage. Wait, the gate source resistance R is given by R = Vg^2 / P. So Vg is 15 V, P is 0.5 W. So R = (15)^2 / 0.5 = 225 / 0.5 = 450 ohms. But the options don't have 450, so I must be wrong.

Wait, maybe the allowable power is for the gate, and the voltage across the gate is the same as the source voltage when triggered. Alternatively, perhaps the gate source voltage when triggered is 15 V, and the maximum power the gate can handle is 0.5 W. So the maximum current would be when the power is maximum.

So, power P = V^2 / R. Solving for R: R = V^2 / P.

Wait, V is 15 V, P is 0.5 W. So R = (15)^2 / 0.5 = 225 / 0.5 = 450 ohms. But again, no option for that.

Wait, perhaps I'm misapplying the formula. Maybe the power is Ig * Vg, not Vg squared over R. Let me think: power is Vg * Ig. And Ohm's law says Vg = Ig * R. So substituting, P = Ig * (Ig * R) = Ig^2 * R. So Ig^2 R = P. But then R = P / (Ig^2). Wait, but I don't know Ig. Hmm.

Alternatively, using Vg = Ig R. So from P = Vg * Ig, substitute Vg = Ig R. So P = Ig^2 R. So R = P / (Ig^2). But without Ig, I can't find R. So that approach doesn't help.

Wait, maybe the gate cathode characteristic's straight line of 130 is the resistance. So the gate source resistance is 130 ohms. So the answer would be option C, 130 ohm. But that seems too straightforward, and why are the other values given?

Wait, maybe the gate cathode characteristic is given as a line, like in the V-I graph, and the slope is 130 ohms. So that would be the resistance. Then, using the power and voltage to find something else? Or perhaps the gate source resistance is determined by that line.

I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try another approach. The gate source resistance (R) is determined by the maximum allowable power dissipation and the voltage applied.

Wait, the power dissipated by the gate is P = Vg^2 / R. So R = Vg^2 / P. Plugging in Vg=15 V, P=0.5 W:

R = (15)^2 / 0.5 = 225 / 0.5 = 450 ohms.

But this isn't one of the options. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the gate source voltage isn't 15 V. Or perhaps the 15 V is the voltage across the gate when it's conducting, and the power is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the gate source resistance is given by the line's value, 130 ohms. So the answer would be option C. But why are the other parameters given then? Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the 130 is the gate voltage when the gate current is zero, but that doesn't make sense because the gate usually doesn't have voltage without current in that context.

Alternatively, maybe the 130 is the gate current in some condition, but that also doesn't fit. Hmm.

Wait, another angle: The gate cathode characteristic is a straight line, which implies a linear relationship between gate voltage (Vg) and gate current (Ig). The slope of this line would be the conductance, which is 1/R. So if the line is represented as Vg = m * Ig + c, but if it's a straight line through the origin, then c=0, so Vg = m * Ig. So m is the resistance R. So R would be the inverse of the slope. But I don't have the slope, just the value 130. Maybe 130 is the slope? Or maybe 130 is R?

Wait, if the gate cathode characteristic (the line) is given as 130, perhaps that's the resistance in ohms. So R = 130 ohms. So then, the gate source resistance is 130, option C. But again, why are they giving the other values?

Wait, maybe the 130 is the gate voltage when the gate current is maximum, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the line's equation is Vg = 130 * Ig, implying R is 130 ohms.

So, perhaps the correct answer is C: 130 ohm.

But then the other parameters given don't seem to affect the calculation. That makes me think I might have missed something. Maybe the 130 is the maximum gate current or something else.

Wait, another possibility: The gate source resistance is determined by the allowable power and the maximum gate voltage. So R = Vg^2 / P. So if Vg is 15 V and P is 0.5 W, then R is 15^2 / 0.5 = 450 ohms. But that's not an option. Maybe I got the voltage wrong. Is Vg perhaps 15 V when the gate is triggered, but the actual voltage across the resistor is different?

Alternatively, perhaps the gate voltage when conducting is 1 V or something, but that doesn't fit with the given 15 V.

I'm stuck. Let me look at the options again. The options are A through I, with numerical values. One of them is 130, which is option C. But I'm not sure why the other parameters are given if that's the case.

Wait, maybe the 130 is the maximum gate current in mA or something. Or perhaps it's the gate trigger voltage or current. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the gate source resistance is given by the line's value, 130, and the other parameters are red herrings. So the answer would be 130 ohms, option C.

But I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct calculation is R = (15)^2 / 0.5 = 450, but since that's not an option, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the power dissipation is the maximum allowed, so the gate current is the maximum when the voltage is maximum. So, using P = Vg * Ig, and R = Vg / Ig. So, from P = Vg * Ig, and R = Vg / Ig. So, substituting Ig = P / Vg into R: R = Vg / (P/Vg) ) = Vg^2 / P, which is the same as before.

So R = 15^2 / 0.5 = 450 ohms. Since that's not an option, perhaps I'm missing a factor. Wait, maybe the gate voltage is 1.5 V instead of 15 V? No, the question says 15 V.

Alternatively, perhaps the power is 0.5 W, so 0.5 W = (15 V)^2 / R â†’ R= 225/0.5=450 ohms. So maybe the correct answer isn't among the options. But that can't be right because the options are provided.

Wait, perhaps the line's value (130) is actually the gate source resistance. So the answer would be 130 ohms, option C. But then why include the other values? Maybe the question is a trick, and the answer is simply 130.

Alternatively, perhaps the line's value is 130 mV or something, but that doesn't fit with the units.

I'm really not sure. I think I might have to go with the calculation I did, even though it doesn't match any option, but since that can't be, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is different.

Wait, another approach: The gate power dissipation is P = Ig^2 R. But from Ohm's law, Vg = Ig R, so Ig = Vg/R. Plugging into P: P = (Vg/R)^2 * R = Vg^2 / R. So again, R = Vg^2 / P = 15^2 / 0.5 = 450. No option for that. So perhaps the question intended to use the gate cathode characteristic line as the resistance, so the answer is 130 ohms.

The question involves determining the gate source resistance for an SCR, given the gate cathode characteristic as a straight line of 130, a triggered source voltage of 15 V, and an allowable gate power dissipation of 0.5 W. The analysis proceeds as follows:

1. **Interpretation of the Gate Cathode Characteristic**: The gate cathode characteristic is described as a straight line of 130. This is interpreted as the gate source resistance, as the slope of the V-I curve in the gate cathode characteristic represents the resistance. Thus, the gate source resistance is likely 130 ohms.

2. **Power and Voltage Relationship**: The allowable gate power dissipation is given as 0.5 W, and the triggered source voltage is 15 V. Using the formula for power dissipation in a resistor, \( P = \frac{V^2}{R} \), an attempt is made to calculate the resistance. Substituting \( P = 0.5 \, \text{W} \) and \( V = 15 \, \text{V} \), the resistance is calculated as:
   \[
   R = \frac{V^2}{P} = \frac{15^2}{0.5} = \frac{225}{0.5} = 450 \, \Omega.
   \]
   However, 450 ohms is not among the provided options, suggesting either a misinterpretation of the problem or that the gate source resistance is directly given by the characteristic line.

3. **Revisiting the Gate Cathode Characteristic**: Given the confusion and the absence of 450 ohms in the options, it is concluded that the gate cathode characteristic line of 130 directly represents the gate source resistance. Therefore, the gate source resistance is 130 ohms.

4. **Final Answer**: Based on the interpretation of the gate cathode characteristic and the absence of 450 ohms in the options, the gate source resistance is determined to be 130 ohms.
