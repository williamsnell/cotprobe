Okay, so I've got this question about gas effusion, and I'm a bit rusty on my chemistry, but I'll try to think it through. Alright, let's see... The question says that 125 cm³ of hydrogen gas effuses through a small hole in 135 seconds. They're asking how long it would take the same volume of oxygen gas to do the same under identical conditions.

Hmm, effusion... Oh right, Graham's Law of Effusion! I remember that the rate of effusion depends on the molar mass of the gas. The formula, I think, is something like rate1 over rate2 equals the square root of (molar mass2 over molar mass1). Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me get this straight.

Graham's Law states that the effusion rate is inversely proportional to the square root of the molar mass. So, the lighter the gas, the faster it effuses. So the formula should be rate = (1 / sqrt(molar mass)).

Wait, no, the correct formula for the effusion rates is rate1/rate2 = sqrt(M2/M1), where M is the molar mass. So yeah, the rates are inversely proportional to the square roots of their molar masses.

But wait, the problem here is about the time taken for effusion. Since the volume is the same, I think the time is inversely related to the rate. Because if a gas effuses faster, it takes less time, right?

So if rate is volume/time, then time is proportional to 1/rate. So time1/time2 = (rate2/rate1), because if rate1 is higher, time1 is lower.

So given that, for hydrogen and oxygen:

M_H2 is about 2 g/mol, and M_O2 is 32 g/mol.

So according to Graham's Law, the ratio of rates (rate H2 / rate O2) would be sqrt(M_O2 / M_H2) = sqrt(32/2) = sqrt(16) = 4. So rate H2 is 4 times rate O2.

Wait, no, because the formula is rate1/rate2 = sqrt(M2/M1). So in this case, rate H2 / rate O2 = sqrt(32/2) = sqrt(16) =4. So yes, hydrogen's rate is four times that of oxygen.

But wait, the question gives the time for hydrogen. Since rate is inversely proportional to time (because rate = volume/time), if rate H2 is 4 times rate O2, then the time for O2 should be 4 times longer than that for H2. Because if you're moving faster, you take less time.

Wait, let me think again. Rate is higher for H2. So for the same volume, time = volume / rate. So if rate is 4 times higher, time would be 1/4 as much. So H2's time is 135s, which is 1/4 of O2's time.

So solving that, O2's time would be 135s *4 = 540s.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 540s. Let me check the options again.

Options are A:270, B:675, C:725, D:325, E:600, F:400, G:537, H:245, I:810, J:190.

Hmm, 540 isn't listed. Maybe I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up the ratio. Let me re-examine the formula.

Graham's Law: (rate1)/(rate2) = sqrt(M2/M1).

So M1 is molar mass of gas 1, M2 of gas 2.

In this case, gas1 is H2 (M=2), gas2 is O2 (M=32).

So (rate_H2)/(rate_O2) = sqrt(32/2) = sqrt(16)=4.

So rate_H2 = 4 * rate_O2.

But since the volume is the same, the time is inversely proportional to the rate. So time_H2 = volume / rate_H2, time_O2 = volume / rate_O2.

So time_O2 = time_H2 * (rate_H2 / rate_O2).

Because if rate doubles, time halves.

So time_O2 = 135s * (4) = 540s.

But none of the options match that.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate using the time ratio. Let's think again.

Effusion time is inversely proportional to the rate. So time1/time2 = rate2/rate1.

Since rate1/rate2 =4, rate2/rate1 =1/4.

So time1/time2 =1/4 → time2=4*time1.

So time_O2 =4*135=540s.

But again, 540 not in options. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I did the inverse. What if I mixed up the ratio?

Wait, the formula is time1/time2 = sqrt(M1/M2).

Wait, let me rederive it.

Graham's law: rate1/rate2 = sqrt(M2/M1)

Since rate = volume/time, same volume → rate ∝ 1/time.

So (1/time1)/(1/time2) = sqrt(M2/M1)

Which is (time2)/(time1) = sqrt(M2/M1)

So time2/time1 = sqrt(32/2) = sqrt(16)=4.

So time2=4 * time1.

So time1=135s, time2=540s. But no option has 540.

Wait, looking back, perhaps I made a mistake in the molar masses.

Wait, H2 has molar mass 2 g/mol, O2 is 32 g/mol? Yes, because O is 16, so O2 is 32.

Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the same number of moles instead of the same volume. Wait, no, the question says same volume. So same volume, same conditions, so same pressure and temperature, so same number of moles? Wait no, no, same volume under same conditions would have same moles? Wait, no, because PV =nRT, so if V same, P same, T same, then n same. Because n = PV/(RT), so same for both gases.

Wait, but wait, in the question, it says "the same volume of oxygen gas". So same volume as the hydrogen's. So same n, because n=PV/(RT) and V same, P and T same.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

If the number of moles is same, then the time should depend on the rate, which is based on molar mass.

Wait, but the time for effusion for the same number of moles would depend on the rate. Because rate is moles per second. So time = moles / rate.

If rate is proportional to 1/sqrt(M), then time ∝ sqrt(M).

So for same moles, time_H2 = n/(k/sqrt(2)), time_O2 =n/(k/sqrt(32)).

So time_O2/time_H2 = [n/(k/sqrt(32))]/[n/(k/sqrt(2))] ] → sqrt(32)/sqrt(2) = sqrt(16)=4.

So time_O2 =4* time_H2= 540. Again, same result.

But options don't have 540. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the initial assumption. Let me think: perhaps the question isn't about same number of moles, but same volume, which under same conditions implies same moles. Or perhaps the question is considering volume under different conditions, but the question states same T and P, so same n if V is same.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently.

Effusion rate is proportional to pressure over sqrt(molar mass), but under same pressure, it's just proportional to 1/sqrt(M).

So the rate of H2 is higher, so time for H2 is less than O2.

But without same moles, perhaps the question is considering the rate as volume per time, but under same P and T, so same n.

Wait a minute, perhaps I should think in terms of the time for a given volume.

The time taken for a certain volume to effuse is inversely proportional to the rate. So if rate is higher, time is lower.

Since rate = k / sqrt(M), time is proportional to sqrt(M).

So time_H2 = k * sqrt(2).

time_O2 =k*sqrt(32).

So time_O2 / time_H2 = sqrt(32/2) = sqrt(16)=4.

So time_O2=4 *135=540s.

But again, 540s is not among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, maybe I made a mistake in the molar masses. Let's recheck.

Hydrogen (H2) has molar mass 2 g/mol. Oxygen (O2) is 32 g/mol? Because O is 16, so O2 is 32, yes.

Hmm, but the options don't have 540. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let's look at the options again. Option G is 537s, which is close to 540. Maybe it's a rounding thing. Wait, perhaps because in reality, the molar masses are more precise. Let me check.

The exact molar mass of H2 is about 2.016 g/mol, O2 is about 32.00 g/mol. So the ratio would be sqrt(32.00/2.016)= sqrt(15.84) ≈3.98, which is approximately 4. So 135 *3.98 is about 537.3 seconds, which is option G:537s.

Ah, I see! So when I assumed M of H2 as exactly 2, it gave 540, but with more precise M, it's around 537s.

So the correct answer is G:537s.

To solve the problem, we use Graham's Law of Effusion, which states that the rate of effusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molar mass. The formula is:

\[
\frac{\text{rate}_1}{\text{rate}_2} = \sqrt{\frac{M_2}{M_1}}
\]

Here, \( M_1 \) and \( M_2 \) are the molar masses of the two gases. For hydrogen (\( \text{H}_2 \)) and oxygen (\( \text{O}_2 \)), the molar masses are approximately \( 2 \, \text{g/mol} \) and \( 32 \, \text{g/mol} \), respectively. Substituting these values:

\[
\frac{\text{rate}_{\text{H}_2}}{\text{rate}_{\text{O}_2}} = \sqrt{\frac{32}{2}} = \sqrt{16} = 4
\]

This means the rate of effusion of hydrogen is 4 times faster than that of oxygen. Since the volume of gas is the same and the temperature and pressure are constant, the time taken for effusion is inversely proportional to the rate. Therefore, the time ratio is:

\[
\frac{\text{time}_{\text{H}_2}}{\text{time}_{\text{O}_2}} = \frac{\text{rate}_{\text{O}_2}}{\text{rate}_{\text{H}_2}}
\]

Given that the time for hydrogen is \( 135 \, \text{s} \), the time for oxygen is:

\[
\text{time}_{\text{O}_2} = 4 \times 135 = 540 \, \text{s}
\]

However, the exact molar masses of hydrogen and oxygen are slightly more precise: \( 2.016 \, \text{g/mol} \) for hydrogen and \( 32.00 \, \text{g/mol} \) for oxygen. Using these values:

\[
\frac{\text{rate}_{\text{H}_2}}{\text{rate}_{\text{O}_2}} = \sqrt{\frac{32.00}{2.016}} = \sqrt{15.84} \approx 3.98
\]

Thus:

\[
\text{time}_{\text{O}_2} = 3.98 \times 135 \approx 537.3 \, \text{s}
\]

This matches option \( G: 537 \, \text{s} \), which accounts for the slight rounding of molar masses. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**G: 537 s**
