Okay, so I have this economics question here, and I'm supposed to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question says that the price of cars and the price of steel both increase. And the setup is that the automobile industry is fairly competitive, and the supply of steel is constant in the short run. I need to figure out why both prices went up. The options are A to E, so I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, let me think about this. I remember that in economics, prices can change due to shifts in supply or demand. Since both car and steel prices increased, I should consider factors that affect both.

First, the supply of steel is constant in the short run. That means the steel producers aren't changing how much they produce. So, if the price of steel went up, maybe the demand for steel increased. Because if supply doesn't change but price goes up, it's probably because more people want to buy it.

Why would the demand for steel increase? Well, steel is a major input in making cars. So if the automobile industry is using more steel, that could drive up the demand for steel. Wait, but why would they use more steel? Maybe because they're making more cars. So if the demand for cars increases, car manufacturers would produce more, which requires more steel. That would increase the demand for steel, even though the supply of steel isn't changing. So, higher demand for steel would cause its price to go up.

But wait, what about the price of cars? If the demand for cars increases, the competitive automobile industry would respond. In a competitive market, if demand increases, businesses would try to produce more, which could lead to higher prices if marginal costs are rising or if the demand outpaces supply. But wait, the automobile industry is competitive, so maybe more firms enter or existing ones expand production. But if the supply of steel is fixed, getting more steel might be harder, leading to higher costs for car makers.

So, let me break it down. Suppose the demand for cars goes up. Car manufacturers want to make more cars to meet this higher demand. But making more cars requires more steel. Since the steel supply is fixed, the increased demand for steel (from car makers) would cause steel prices to rise. At the same time, the car manufacturers, facing higher input costs (steel is more expensive), might have to increase the price of cars if their costs go up. Alternatively, the higher demand for cars could allow them to increase prices because people are willing to pay more.

Looking at the options, option C is "Increased demand for cars." That would fit because higher demand for cars leads to higher production, which increases demand for steel, causing steel prices to rise. Also, with higher demand, car prices might go up if the industry can't immediately increase supply enough, or because costs are higher.

Other options: Option A is increased taxes on cars. That would increase car prices, but how about steel? Taxes on cars might reduce demand for cars, which would reduce demand for steel, so steel prices might go down. So that doesn't explain both prices going up.

Option B is decreased demand for cars. That would probably lead to lower car prices and less demand for steel, so steel prices would drop. Not matching.

Option D is decreased supply of steel. But the question says the supply of steel is constant, so D is out.

Option E is technological advancements. That usually decreases costs, leading to lower prices, not higher. So E doesn't fit.

So the only option that makes sense is option C: Increased demand for cars. That would cause both prices to rise.

The price increases in both cars and steel can be attributed to an increased demand for cars. In a competitive automobile industry, higher demand for cars leads manufacturers to produce more vehicles. Since steel is a primary input in car production, this increased output necessitates a higher demand for steel. Given that the supply of steel is constant in the short run, the rise in demand for steel drives up its price. Simultaneously, the higher demand for cars allows manufacturers to increase car prices, either due to higher production costs (from more expensive steel) or because consumers are willing to pay more amid strong demand.

Options A, B, D, and E do not align with the scenario: increased taxes on cars (A) would likely reduce demand for steel, decreased demand for cars (B) would lower both prices, decreased supply of steel (D) contradicts the constant supply assumption, and technological advancements (E) would typically reduce costs and prices. Thus, the correct answer is:

C: Increased demand for cars.
