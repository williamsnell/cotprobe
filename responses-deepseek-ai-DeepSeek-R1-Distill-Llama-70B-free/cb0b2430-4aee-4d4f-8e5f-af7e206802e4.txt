Okay, so I need to figure out what psychology is from the given options. Let me start by recalling what I know about psychology. Psychology is a social science that studies the human mind and its functions, affecting behavior in various contexts. I remember that it's about understanding people's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors.

Looking at the options, option A talks about the legal system, which doesn't sound right. That's more like law or criminology. Option B says it's the study of behavior in living organisms. Hmm, that's a possibility because psychology does look at behavior, but I think it's more specific than that. Option C is about human interaction, which is part of it, but not the whole picture. Sociology might cover more of that.

Option D mentions chemical processes in a lab, which is more chemistry or maybe neuroscience, but not the main focus of psychology. E is about plants, so that's botany. F says it's the study of the mind, which aligns with what I know. Psychology does focus on the mind, thoughts, and mental processes.

Option G states it's the science of behavior. That rings a bell too because behaviorism is a major part of psychology, focusing on observable behaviors. So both F and G seem relevant. Wait, but the question is asking for the best definition. Psychology is both the study of the mind and behavior. Some definitions might emphasize one over the other.

Option H is historical events, which is history. I is planetary systems, which is astronomy. J is about the physical body, which is biology or physiology.

So the options narrow down to B, F, and G. B is broader, including all living organisms, which is true but maybe not specific enough. F focuses on the mind, while G is about behavior. I think a comprehensive approach would include both, but the question is looking for the best single answer.

I recall that psychology is often defined as the science of behavior and mental processes. So option G says "the science of behavior," which covers both observable actions and mental aspects. Alternatively, option F is about the mind, which is a core part but might not encompass the behavioral aspect as directly.

Wait, another thought: sometimes psychology is referred to as the study of behavior, which includes both overt actions and underlying mental processes. So option G might be more accurate because it's stated as the science of behavior, which can include the mental aspects as part of what influences behavior.

But I'm a bit confused because I've also heard it defined as the study of the mind. Let me think about common textbook definitions. I think many introductory psychology texts define it as the science of behavior and mental processes. So option G might be the better answer because it's broader, including both behavior and, implicitly, the mind.

Alternatively, option F is more specific to the mind, which is a key component. But if I have to choose between F and G, knowing that psychology encompasses both, I lean towards G because it's phrased as the science of behavior, which is a common definition.

Wait, but some sources might define it primarily as the study of the mind. I'm a bit torn here. Let me think about the options again. Option B is about living organisms' behavior, which is correct but perhaps too broad. Option F is about the mind, which is accurate. Option G is about behavior as a science.

I think the most precise and widely accepted definition is that psychology is the science of behavior, both observable and covert (like thoughts). So the answer is either F or G. But the question is about the best fit among the options.

Another angle: looking at the options, option G is "the science of behavior," while option F is "the study of the mind." Since the question is phrased as "what is psychology," and considering that behavior encompasses both actions and mental processes, G might be the better answer. Or perhaps the question expects the more traditional answer, which is the study of the mind.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to eliminate the others. A, C, D, E, H, I, J are clearly not psychology. So it's between B, F, and G. B is broader, including all living organisms, which is correct but perhaps not the primary focus. Psychology does study human behavior but also that of other animals sometimes.

So the main contenders are F and G. I think the most accurate answer is F: the study of the mind, because that's the core concept, even though behavior is a big part of it. Or maybe G is better because it's phrased as a science, which psychology is.

Wait, another approach: looking at the options, F is "the study of the mind," which is a common way to describe psychology. G is "the science of behavior." Both are correct, but which one is more accurate as per the options given?

I think in many cases, psychology is described as the study of behavior, so G might be the intended answer here. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe the question expects F as the answer because it's more about the mind.

Alternatively, perhaps the best answer is G because it's a more precise scientific definition. I'm a bit confused, but I think I'll settle on G as the correct choice.

Psychology is best defined as the science of behavior, encompassing both observable actions and underlying mental processes. While it also involves the study of the mind, the broader and more precise definition focuses on behavior, making option G the most accurate choice.

Answer: G
