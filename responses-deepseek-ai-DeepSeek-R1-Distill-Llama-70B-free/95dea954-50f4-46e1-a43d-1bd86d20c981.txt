Alright, so I'm trying to figure out where the rose r = sin(3θ) has a vertical tangent in the first quadrant. Hmm, okay. I remember that for polar coordinates, the conditions for vertical tangents involve the derivative of r with respect to θ. 

Wait, right! The formula for the tangent line in polar coordinates says that the slope dy/dx is given by (r' sinθ + r cosθ) / (r' cosθ - r sinθ). For a vertical tangent, the denominator must be zero because that would make the slope undefined (since division by zero is undefined). So I need to set the denominator equal to zero and solve for θ.

The denominator is r' cosθ - r sinθ. So setting this to zero gives:

r' cosθ - r sinθ = 0

I need to compute r', which is the derivative of r with respect to θ. Since r = sin(3θ), r' would be 3 cos(3θ).

So substituting in, we get:

3 cos(3θ) * cosθ - sin(3θ) * sinθ = 0

Hmm, simplifying this equation. Let's see. Maybe I can factor this or use a trigonometric identity. Wait, 3 cos(3θ) cosθ is one term, and the other is sin(3θ) sinθ. Maybe I can expand cos(3θ) and sin(3θ) using multiple-angle identities.

I recall that sin(3θ) = 3 sinθ - 4 sin³θ, and cos(3θ) = 4 cos³θ - 3 cosθ. But substituting these might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe I can factor the equation differently.

Let me rewrite the equation:

3 cos(3θ) cosθ = sin(3θ) sinθ

Divide both sides by cosθ cos(3θ), assuming cosθ and cos(3θ) are not zero. That gives:

3 = [sin(3θ)/cos(3θ)] * [sinθ / cosθ] * (1/sinθ) ?

Wait, maybe that's not the right approach. Let me think again. Alternatively, using the identity for cosine of sum or difference.

Wait, what if I express cos(3θ) cosθ and sin(3θ) sinθ in terms of sum and difference angles. There's an identity that says cos(A - B) = cosA cosB + sinA sinB. But here, I have 3 cos(3θ) cosθ minus something. Hmm, maybe not directly applicable.

Alternatively, let me try bringing everything to one side:

3 cos(3θ) cosθ - sin(3θ) sinθ = 0

Hmm. Maybe factor terms. Let's see:

3 cos(3θ) cosθ = sin(3θ) sinθ

Let me try substituting t = θ. Not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps express everything in terms of sin and cos of θ. Let's substitute cos(3θ) and sin(3θ):

So,

3 * (4 cos³θ - 3 cosθ) * cosθ - (3 sinθ - 4 sin³θ) * sinθ = 0

Let me expand this:

First term: 3*(4 cos^3 θ -3 cosθ ) * cosθ = 3*(4 cos^4 θ - 3 cos^2 θ )

Second term: (3 sinθ -4 sin^3 θ) * sinθ = 3 sin^2 θ -4 sin^4 θ

So putting it all together:

3*(4 cos^4 θ -3 cos² θ) - (3 sin² θ -4 sin^4 θ) = 0

Expand the first part:

12 cos^4 θ -9 cos² θ -3 sin² θ +4 sin^4 θ = 0

Hmm, that's a quartic equation. Maybe we can factor this or express in terms of cos^2θ.

Using the identity sin²θ = 1 - cos²θ.

Let me substitute sin²θ = 1 - cos²θ and sin^4θ = (1 - cos²θ)^2.

So substituting sin²θ gives:

12 cos^4 θ -9 cos² θ -3(1 - cos²θ) +4 (1 - cos²θ)^2 = 0

Expanding each term:

12 cos^4 θ -9 cos² θ -3 +3 cos²θ +4 (1 - 2 cos²θ + cos^4θ ) =0

Expanding the 4( ... ) term:

4 -8 cos²θ +4 cos^4θ

Now combine all terms:

12 cos^4 θ -9 cos² θ -3 +3 cos²θ +4 -8 cos²θ +4 cos^4θ =0

Combine like terms:

(12 cos^4θ +4 cos^4θ ) + (-9 cos²θ +3 cos²θ -8 cos²θ ) + (-3 +4 ) =0

So:

16 cos^4θ + (-14 cos²θ ) +1 =0

So the equation becomes:

16 cos^4θ -14 cos²θ +1 =0

Let me let x = cos²θ. Then the equation is:

16x² -14x +1 =0

Quadratic in x. Using quadratic formula:

x = [14 ± sqrt( (14)^2 -4*16*1 ) ]/(2*16)

Compute discriminant:

196 -64 =132

So x = [14 ± sqrt(132)] /32

Simplify sqrt(132): sqrt(4*33) = 2*sqrt(33). So sqrt(132) = 2√33 ≈ 2*5.7446≈11.489

So x = [14 ±11.489]/32

Calculating both possibilities:

First solution: (14 +11.489)/32 =25.489/32 ≈0.796 (approximately 0.8)

Second solution: (14-11.489)/32 =2.511/32≈0.0784 (approximately 0.0784)

So x=cos²θ ≈0.8 or 0.0784.

Taking square roots:

cosθ = sqrt(0.8) or cosθ= sqrt(0.0784)

sqrt(0.8)≈0.8944, and sqrt(0.0784)=approx 0.28.

So cosθ ≈0.8944 → θ ≈ arccos(0.8944). Let's compute that: arccos(0.8944) is roughly 0.45 radians? Wait, wait, cos(0.45)=approx 0.900, so maybe around 0.44 rad. Hmm, let's be more precise. 0.45 radians is about 25.8 degrees. Cos(0.45)=approx 0.900. So 0.8944 is a little less, so θ≈0.46 rad.

Alternatively, for the other solution, cosθ≈0.28, so θ≈1.28 radians (since cos(1.28)=approx 0.28). Wait, but the question is about the first quadrant. First quadrant is θ between 0 and π/2 (approx 1.5708 radians). So 1.28 is within that range.

Wait, but let me double-check. 1.28 rad is about 73 degrees, which is in the first quadrant.

So the possible θ values where vertical tangents occur are around 0.46 rad and 1.28 rad.

Wait, but the options given are:

A: 0.30

B: 0.39

C:0.52

D:0.90

E:0.70

F:0.47

G:0.60

H:0.25

I: nowhere

J:0.80

Looking at the options, F is 0.47, which is close to our first solution of approximately 0.46. The other solution is 1.28, which isn't among the options. So the answer would be F: θ=0.47.

Wait, but let me make sure. Did I make any mistake in the calculations? Let me go back a step.

Wait, the equation we solved was 16 cos^4θ -14 cos²θ +1=0, which gave x=0.8 and 0.0784. So cosθ would be sqrt(0.8)=approx 0.894, and sqrt(0.0784)=0.28. So θ= arccos(0.894)=approx 0.45 rad, and arccos(0.28)=approx 1.28 rad.

But 0.47 is very close to 0.45. So the answer would be F: 0.47.

Alternatively, maybe I should check which of the options is closer to the actual solution. Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

Compute for x=0.8: cosθ= sqrt(0.8)= approx 0.89442719. So θ= arccos(0.89442719) ≈ 0.45 radians?

Wait, let's compute arccos(0.89442719):

Using calculator: cos(0.45) is about 0.9001. So 0.8944 is a little less, so θ would be a little larger than 0.45. Let me check cos(0.46): cos(0.46)= approx 0.8952, which is a bit higher than 0.8944. Hmm, maybe 0.455 radians. Let me calculate in steps.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a better approach. Let's compute theta where cos(theta) = sqrt(0.8) ≈0.8944.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me go back. When I had 3 cos(3θ) cosθ − sin(3θ) sinθ =0, I might have taken a wrong approach in expanding. Alternatively, perhaps I can use another identity.

Wait, perhaps I can write the equation as 3 cos(3θ) cosθ = sin(3θ) sinθ. Let me consider the ratio:

[3 cos(3θ) cosθ ] / [sin(3θ) sinθ] =1

Hmm, but that might not help much. Alternatively, perhaps using product-to-sum identities.

The product-to-sum formula states that:

cos A cos B = [cos(A+B) + cos(A-B)] / 2

sin A sin B = [cos(A-B) - cos(A+B)] / 2

So substituting:

3 * [ cos(4θ) + cos(2θ) ] / 2 = [ cos(2θ) - cos(4θ) ] / 2

Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate denominators:

3 [ cos(4θ) + cos(2θ) ] = cos(2θ) - cos(4θ)

Expanding left side:

3 cos(4θ) +3 cos(2θ) = cos(2θ) - cos(4θ)

Bring all terms to left:

3 cos4θ +3 cos2θ - cos2θ + cos4θ =0

Combine like terms:

(3 cos4θ + cos4θ) + (3 cos2θ - cos2θ )=0 → 4 cos4θ + 2 cos2θ=0

So 4 cos4θ +2 cos2θ =0

Factor out 2:

2(2 cos4θ + cos2θ )=0 → 2 cos4θ + cos2θ =0

Let me let φ=2θ. Then equation becomes 2 cos(2φ) + cosφ =0.

So 2 cos(2φ) + cosφ =0.

Express cos(2φ) in terms of cos^2φ: cos(2φ)=2 cos²φ-1.

So substituting:

2*(2 cos²φ -1 ) + cosφ=0 →4 cos²φ -2 + cosφ=0

Rearranged:4 cos²φ + cosφ -2=0.

This is a quadratic in cosφ. Let me set x=cosφ:

4x² +x -2=0.

Using quadratic formula: x=(-1 ±√(1 +32 )) /8 → x=(-1 ±√33)/8.

Since x=cosφ, it must be in [-1,1].

Compute roots:

√33≈5.7446.

So x= (-1 +5.7446)/8 ≈4.7446/8≈0.593075.

x= (-1 -5.7446)/8≈-6.7446/8≈-0.843075.

So cosφ≈0.593 or cosφ≈-0.843.

But φ=2θ, and θ is in the first quadrant, so φ=2θ between 0 and π (since θ in first quadrant, up to π/2, so 2θ up to π).

So cosφ can be positive or negative.

Let's consider each case.

Case 1: cosφ≈0.593.

So φ≈arccos(0.593)≈53.7 degrees or in radians ≈0.938 radians.

But wait, 0.593 is the value of cos(53.7°), which is about 0.938 radians.

Alternatively, the other solution in the range would be 2π -0.938, but since φ is up to π (180 degrees), the other solution is π -0.938≈2.203 radians, but wait, wait φ is up to π (since θ up to π/2).

Wait, no. Wait, φ=2θ and θ is in the first quadrant, so θ can be from 0 to π/2, so φ from 0 to π.

So possible solutions for φ where cosφ=0.593 are φ≈0.938 radians and φ≈π -0.938≈2.203 radians.

But 2.203 is beyond π (which is about 3.1416), no, wait, 2.203 is less than π (3.1416), so it's a valid solution.

Wait, no, wait: π is approximately 3.1416, so 2.203 is less than that, so it's valid.

Case 2: cosφ≈-0.843.

So φ≈arccos(-0.843)≈147 degrees≈2.565 radians.

Because cos(147°)=cos(180-33)= -cos(33)≈-0.838, which is close to our value. So approximately 2.565 radians.

Now, since φ=2θ, we can find θ by dividing by 2.

So for case 1: φ≈0.938 radians → θ≈0.469 radians.

Which is approximately 0.47 radians, which matches option F.

For the same case, φ≈2.203 radians → θ≈1.1015 radians, which is about 63 degrees, but in the first quadrant.

So two possible solutions in the first quadrant: θ≈0.469 and θ≈1.1015 radians.

Wait, but let me check these θ values. So for θ≈0.469, which is about 26.9 degrees, and θ≈1.1015, which is about 63 degrees.

Now, the question is about the first quadrant, so both are valid. But let's check the options again. The options are:

A: 0.30

B:0.39

C:0.52

D:0.90

E:0.70

F:0.47

G:0.60

H:0.25

I: nowhere

J:0.80

So 0.469 is approximately 0.47, which is option F.

But wait, what about the other solution θ≈1.1015 radians? That's about 0.47 *2=0.94, wait no, 1.1015 is about 63 degrees. But none of the options match that. The closest option is J: 0.80, which is 0.8 radians, but that's about 45.8 degrees, which is less than 63.

Wait, maybe I should check if the other solution is within the first quadrant and if any options match. Hmm, 1.1015 radians is about 63 degrees, which is in the first quadrant. But none of the options have θ=1.10. The options only go up to J:0.80, which is about 45.8 degrees.

Wait, but wait, the original equation for vertical tangent is when the denominator is zero. So I think both θ≈0.47 and θ≈1.10 are valid solutions, but only θ=0.47 is among the options.

Wait, but the problem says "in the first quadrant". So both θ≈0.47 and θ≈1.10 are in the first quadrant. But the question is asking where, in the first quadrant, does the rose have a vertical tangent. So perhaps it's asking for all such points and which option fits.

But looking at the options, only F:0.47 is present, so that's one of the solutions.

Wait, but I think I made a mistake earlier in the quadratic solution. Let me double-check the steps.

Wait, when I used product-to-sum identities, I arrived at 2 cos4θ + cos2θ=0, then set phi=2θ, leading to 4 cos² phi + cos phi -2=0. Solving that gives cos phi = [ -1 ± sqrt(1 +32) ] /8 → [ -1 ± sqrt(33) ] /8.

Which gives x= [ -1 + sqrt(33) ] /8 ≈ ( -1 +5.7446 ) /8 ≈4.7446/8≈0.593. And the other solution x≈( -1 -5.7446 )/8≈-0.843.

So that seems correct.

So the solutions are theta≈0.47 and theta≈1.10 radians.

But the options don't include 1.10. So perhaps the correct answer is F:0.47.

Alternatively, perhaps the equation only has one solution in the first quadrant? Or maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, the rose r=sin(3θ) is a three-petaled rose. In the first quadrant, maybe it only has one vertical tangent. Alternatively, perhaps both solutions are present.

Wait, but the question is about the first quadrant, so I think both are valid. However, the option F is present as 0.47, which is one of the solutions, so the answer would be F.

But wait, perhaps I should check what θ=0.47 gives for r and dy/dx.

Wait, alternatively,
