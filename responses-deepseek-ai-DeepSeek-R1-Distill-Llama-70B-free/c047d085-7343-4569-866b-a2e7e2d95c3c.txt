Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the volume of air needed for the complete combustion of octane gasoline. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the problem says that 4 liters of octane weigh 3.19 kg. Wait, wait, I'm a bit confused. Is 4 liters the volume, and 3.19 kg the mass? Because typically, the density of gasoline is around 0.7-0.8 g/cm³, so 4 liters would weigh about 3 kg. Oh, right, octane's density is around 0.703 g/cm³, so 4 liters would be 4 * 0.703 = 2.812 kg. Wait, but the problem says it's 3.19 kg. Hmm, maybe that's a typo or something, but I guess I'll go with the numbers given.

So first, I need to find the volume of air required for complete combustion of 4 liters of octane. Wait, but wait, the question is a bit ambiguous. Are they giving me 4 liters of octane, or is it 4 liters of gasoline, which is mostly octane but maybe some other stuff? Probably, for this problem, it's just octane.

The chemical formula for octane is C8H18. The combustion reaction would be:

C8H18 + O2 → CO2 + H2O

But to balance it, I need to find the stoichiometric equation. Let me balance it properly.

The balanced equation is: 2 C8H18 + 25 O2 → 16 CO2 + 18 H2O.

Wait, let me check again. Each C8H18 has 8 C and 18 H. So for each molecule, 8 CO2 and 9 H2O (since 2 H per H2O). But to balance, let's do it step by step.

C8H18 + O2 → CO2 + H2O.

The carbons: 8 on the left, so 8 CO2 on the right.

The hydrogens: 18 H in C8H18, which means 9 H2O molecules because each H2O has 2 H, so 9 H2O gives 18 H.

So, the equation becomes:

C8H18 + O2 → 8 CO2 + 9 H2O.

Now, balancing the oxygen. On the right, 8*(2 O from CO2) = 16 O, and 9*(1 O from H2O) = 9 O. Total O on the right is 16 + 9 = 25 O atoms. Since O2 is O2, we need 25/2 molecules of O2 on the left.

So, the balanced equation is:

C8H18 + (25/2) O2 → 8 CO2 + 9 H2O.

So, 1 mole of octane requires 25/2 moles of O2. Now, I need to find out how many moles of octane we have.

But wait, the problem gives me 4 liters of octane. Wait, no, it's 4 liters by volume, but what's the mass? Because moles are based on mass. Oh wait, the problem says 4 liters of octane weigh 3.19 kg. So, the mass is 3.19 kg, which is 3190 grams.

The molar mass of octane (C8H18) is (8*12.01) + (18*1.008) = 96.08 + 18.144 = 114.224 g/mol.

So, the number of moles of octane is mass divided by molar mass. That's 3190 g / 114.224 g/mol ≈ let me calculate that. Let's see, 3190 / 114.224. Hmm, 114.224 * 28 = around 3190? Let me check: 114 * 28 = 3192, so about 28 moles. Wait, yeah, 3190 / 114.224 ≈ 27.9, approximately 28 moles. So about 28 moles.

Each mole of octane requires 25/2 = 12.5 moles of O2. So for 28 moles, the O2 needed is 28 * 12.5 = 350 moles.

Wait, but wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. Yes, because each mole of C8H18 needs 12.5 moles of O2.

Now, at STP, 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 liters. So, 350 moles of O2 would be 350 * 22.4 = let's compute that.

350 * 22.4: 300 *22.4 = 6720, 50*22.4=1120, total 7840 liters. So O2 needed is 7840 liters.

But wait, the problem asks for the volume of air required. Air is approximately 21% oxygen by volume. So, to find the volume of air that contains 7840 liters of O2, we can set up the equation:

Volume_air * 0.21 = 7840 → Volume_air = 7840 / 0.21.

Calculating that: 7840 ÷ 0.21. Let's see, 0.21 is 21/100, so 7840 * (100/21) = (7840 *100)/21 = 784000 /21 ≈ 37333.333 liters.

Wait, that's about 37,333 liters of air. But looking at the options, none of them are close to that. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, let me go back and check. Maybe I messed up somewhere.

Wait, the first assumption: 4 liters of octane weighing 3.19 kg. Let me check that again. 3.19 kg is 3190 grams. Molar mass of octane is 114.23 g/mol. So moles of octane are 3190 / 114.23 ≈ let's do it more accurately.

3190 ÷ 114.23: let's compute 114.23 * 27 = 3082.21, 3190 -3082.21=107.79 left. 107.79 /114.23 ≈ 0.943. So total moles ≈27.943, about 27.94 moles.

So moles of O2 needed: 27.94 * 12.5 = 349.25 moles.

Volume of O2: 349.25 * 22.4 L/mol = let's compute 349 *22.4. 300*22.4=6720, 49*22.4=1097.6, so total 6720+1097.6=7817.6 liters. Plus the 0.25 moles: 0.25 *22.4=5.6, so total 7817.6 +5.6=7823.2 liters O2.

Then, air volume: 7823.2 / 0.21 = let's compute that. 7823.2 ÷ 0.21. So 0.21 is 21/100, so 7823.2 *100/21 =782320 /21 ≈ 37249.0476 liters. Approximately 37,249 liters.

Looking back at the options, the closest option is not among them. Wait, the options are A:22,102, B:58,650, etc. None is near 37,249. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the initial part. Wait, the problem states that 4 liters of octane weigh 3.19 kg. Wait, that's 3190 grams in 4 liters. So the density is 3190 g /4 L = 797.5 g/L, which is 0.7975 kg/L. But wait, that's impossible because octane's density is around 0.7 kg/L. So maybe that's a mistake. Wait, perhaps the problem meant 4 kg of octane? Or perhaps 4 liters have a mass of 3.19 kg, which would make density 3.19 kg /4 L = 0.7975 kg/L, which is higher than typical for octane, but perhaps it's a mistake. Alternatively, maybe it's a typo and the volume is 3.19 liters, but that's not what the question says.

Alternatively, perhaps I should approach this differently. Maybe the 4 liters is the volume, but we're to use that to compute the moles via density. Wait, but the problem gives that 4 liters weigh 3.19 kg, so that's mass.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the moles correctly. Let me redo that.

Molar mass of C8H18: 8*(12.01) + 18*(1.008) = 96.08 + 18.144 = 114.224 g/mol.

Mass given: 3.19 kg = 3190 grams.

Moles = 3190 / 114.224 ≈ 27.94 moles, as before.

O2 required per mole: 12.5 moles, so 27.94 *12.5 = 349.25 moles.

Volume O2 at STP: 349.25 *22.4 L/mol = 7823 liters.

Volume of air: 7823 /0.21 ≈ 37230 liters. But none of the options match this.

Wait, looking at the options, let's see. Option B is 58,650, which is about twice my number. Option G is 44,204, which is a bit higher than my 37k. Option E is 39,175, which is close to 37k but not exact. Hmm.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the O2 required? Let me recheck the balanced equation.

The balanced equation is 2 C8H18 +25 O2 → 16 CO2 +18 H2O.

So per 2 moles of octane, 25 moles O2 are needed. So per mole of octane, 25/2 =12.5 moles O2. So that part is correct.

Another approach: Maybe I should consider that the question is asking for the volume at STP, but perhaps they used 22.4 L/mol at different conditions. Wait, no, STP is standard.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong percentage for oxygen in air. I assumed 21%, but what if the question uses a different percentage, like 20%? Let me check that. If I use 20%:

Volume_air = 7823 /0.20 = 39115 liters. Hmm, that's not an option either. But option E is 39,175.40, which is close to this number. So that's interesting.

Wait, but why would the question use 20% instead of 21%? Maybe I made a mistake in the O2 percentage. Alternatively, perhaps I should double-check the problem statement. Wait, the problem says "at S.T.P." which usually is standard temperature and pressure, which is 0°C and 1 atm, with oxygen making up about 21% by volume. So why would the calculation with 21% not match any option, but with 20% it's close to option E.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the mole calculation. Let me recalculate the moles again.

3190 grams / 114.224 g/mol = 3190 ÷ 114.224. Let me compute this more accurately.

114.224 * 27 = 3082.148. 3190 -3082.148=107.852 grams left. 107.852 ÷114.224 ≈0.943 moles. So total is 27.943 moles.

O2 needed: 27.943 *12.5 = 349.2375 ≈349.24 moles.

O2 volume: 349.24 *22.4 = let me compute:

349 *22.4 = 349 *20=6980, 349*2.4=837.6 → total 7817.6 liters. 0.24 *22.4=5.376 → total 7817.6 +5.376=7822.976 liters.

Now, using 21% oxygen in air: 7822.976 /0.21 ≈ 37245.99 liters.

But looking at the options, none are close to this. So perhaps I made a mistake elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the problem meant 4 kg of octane, not 4 liters. Let me try that. If it's 4 kg (4000 grams), then moles = 4000 /114.224 ≈35.04 moles. O2 needed: 35.04 *12.5=437.5 moles. O2 volume: 437.5 *22.4=9800 liters. Air volume:9800 /0.21≈46666.67 liters. Still not matching any options.

Alternatively, perhaps the given mass is 3.19 kg for 4 liters, which gives the density correctly, but perhaps the problem is asking for the volume at STP, and I'm using the wrong molar volume.

Wait, perhaps I should use 24 liters per mole at STP? No, STP is 22.4 L/mol. Unless the question is considering STP as 25°C, which would be different, but that's not standard.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let me recheck.

The balanced equation is 2 C8H18 +25 O2 → 16 CO2 +18 H2O.

So per mole of C8H18, 25/2 =12.5 moles O2.

That's correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the question includes both CO2 and H2O in the gaseous products, but no, H2O at STP is liquid, so only CO2 is a gas. Wait, no, at STP, H2O is liquid, so only CO2 contributes to gas volume. Wait, but that's only for the products, but the O2 is a gas, so perhaps that's not affecting the air volume needed.

Wait, but in the combustion, the O2 comes from the air, and the products' gases might affect, but no, the question is about the air required, so we're only considering the O2 needed, not the CO2 produced.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the problem is considering the volume of air as 20 times the volume of oxygen, using 5% instead of 21%. No, that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe they're using 23.8% oxygen, but that doesn't change much.

Wait, perhaps I should try to compute using the given options and see which one fits. Let me see.

The options are:

A:22,102.28

B:58,650.00

C:49,350.25

D:65,292.15

E:39,175.40

F:26,116.93

G:44,204.56

H:19,587.70

I:17,481.92

J:31,900.00

Earlier, when I calculated with 21%, I got ~37,250 L, which is not an option. But when I used 20%, it came to ~39,115 L, which is close to option E:39,175.40.

Wait, perhaps I should compute precisely with 21% and see if any option is close.

Wait, let me recalculate the exact volume.

Moles of octane = 3190 /114.224 = let's compute that accurately.

3190 ÷ 114.224.

Let me do this division step by step.

114.224 * 27 = 3082.148.

3190 - 3082.148 = 107.852.

Now, 107.852 ÷ 114.224 = approximately 0.943.

So total moles =27.943.

O2 required: 27.943 * 12.5 = 349.2375 moles.

Volume O2= 349.2375 *22.4 = let's compute:

349.2375 *22.4.

Compute 349 *22.4 = ?

Well, 300*22.4=6720.

49*22.4= (40*22.4) + (9*22.4) = 896 + 201.6 = 1097.6.

So 349*22.4= 6720+1097.6=7817.6.

Now, 0.2375 *22.4=5.28.

So total O2 volume=7817.6 +5.28=7822.88 liters.

Volume of air:7822.88 /0.21= let me compute this.

7822.88 ÷0.21.

0.21 is 21/100, so 7822.88 *100=782288.

782288 ÷21= let's compute.

21*37220=781620.

782288-781620=668.

668 ÷21≈31.8095.

So total is 37220 +31.8095≈37251.8095 liters.

So approximately 37,252 liters.

Looking at the options, none match this. The closest is option G:44,204.56, which is higher, and option E:39,175.40, which is lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial assumption about the volume. Wait, the problem states that 4 liters of octane weigh 3.19 kg. So the mass is 3.19 kg for 4 liters. So the question is about 4 liters of octane, which have a mass of 3.19 kg. So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I mixed up moles of O2 and air. Wait, no, I think the approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the volume in cubic meters, but the options are in liters, so probably not.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses molar volume at STP as 24 liters instead of 22.4? Let me try that.

Volume O2=349.2375 *24= let's compute 349*24=8376, 0.2375*24=5.7, so total 8381.7 liters.

Air volume=8381.7 /0.21≈39858.095 liters.

Now, looking at the options, option B is 58,650, which is way higher. Option E is ~39k, which is close to 39,858. Hmm, but that's not an option either.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute using 22.4 L/mol for O2 and 22.4 for air. Wait, no, O2 is part of air, so using the same molar volume
