Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about the combustion of silicon with oxygen to form silicon dioxide. Hmm, right. The reaction is Si + O2 → SiO2. We're given 10.0 grams of Si and 100.0 grams of O2, and we need to find out how many grams of O2 remain uncombined after the reaction.

Alright, first things first, I should write down the balanced chemical equation. Wait, the given equation is already balanced, right? Let's check. Silicon (Si) has a coefficient of 1, and oxygen (O2) is also 1. On the product side, SiO2 has one Si and two O's. So the equation is balanced as it is. So 1 mole of Si reacts with 1 mole of O2 to produce 1 mole of SiO2.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Let me think again. Wait, SiO2 has one Si and two O atoms. So, for the equation to balance, each O2 molecule has two O atoms. So perhaps the balanced equation is:

Si + O2 → SiO2

Yes, that's correct because one Si and two O (from O2) form one SiO2. So the coefficients are all 1, so it's already balanced.

Now, I need to find out which reactant is the limiting reagent. Because the question is about how much O2 is left, so the limiting reagent will determine how much reacts and how much is left.

So first, I'll calculate the moles of Si and O2.

The molar mass of Si is about 28.085 g/mol. So for 10.0 grams of Si, the moles are 10.0 / 28.085 ≈ 0.356 moles.

Oxygen's molar mass is 32.00 g/mol (since O2 is 2 * 16). So 100.0 g O2 is 100 / 32 = 3.125 moles.

Now, the reaction ratio is 1:1 between Si and O2. So for every mole of Si, one mole of O2 is needed.

We have 0.356 moles of Si, which would require 0.356 moles of O2. But we have 3.125 moles of O2 available. So clearly, Si is the limiting reagent here because it's less in quantity relative to what's needed.

So all the Si will react, and some O2 will remain.

Now, the reaction of 1 mole Si uses 1 mole O2. So 0.356 moles of Si will use 0.356 moles of O2.

So the O2 consumed is 0.356 moles. The initial O2 was 3.125 moles, so the remaining O2 is 3.125 - 0.356 = 2.769 moles.

Wait, wait, let me check that subtraction again. 3.125 minus 0.356 is indeed 2.769.

Now, convert that back to grams. Molar mass of O2 is 32 g/mol. So 2.769 moles * 32 g/mol = ?

Let me calculate that. 2.769 * 32. Let's see: 2*32=64, 0.769*32. 0.7 *32=22.4; 0.069*32≈2.208. So total is 64 + 22.4 + 2.208 = 88.608 grams. Hmm, approximately 88.6 grams.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 88.5 g, which is close. Let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.

Let me recalculate the moles more precisely. Si: 10.0 g / 28.085 g/mol = exactly, let's compute that.

28.085 times 0.356 is about 10. So 10/28.085 is approximately 0.35637 mol.

So O2 consumed is 0.35637 mol.

O2 remaining: initial O2 is 3.125 moles (100/32=3.125 exactly).

3.125 - 0.35637 = 2.76863 moles.

Multiply by 32 g/mol: 2.76863 *32= (2*32)+(0.76863*32).

2*32=64.

0.76863 *32: 0.7*32=22.4, 0.06863*32≈2.195.

So 22.4 + 2.195=24.595.

So 64 +24.595=88.595 grams. So approximately 88.6 grams.

Looking at the options, option B is 88.5 g, which is very close. So I think that's the answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my initial steps to ensure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Balanced equation: correct, 1:1 molar ratio.

2. Moles of Si: 10 / 28.085 ≈ 0.35637 mol.

3. Moles of O2: 100 /32=3.125 mol.

4. Since Si is limiting, O2 needed is 0.35637 mol, so O2 remaining is 3.125 -0.35637=2.76863.

5. Convert to grams: 2.76863 *32=88.595, which rounds to 88.6. The closest option is B:88.5.

Wait, perhaps I should redo the calculation with more precise numbers.

Molar mass of Si is 28.0855 g/mol.

10.0 g / 28.0855 g/mol = let's compute exactly.

28.0855 * 0.356 = approx 10. So 10 /28.0855 = 0.35637 mol.

So O2 consumed: 0.35637 mol.

Thus, O2 remaining: 3.125 -0.35637 = 2.76863 mol.

2.76863 *32 = ?

Let me compute 2.76863 *32.

2 *32 =64.

0.76863 *32:

Compute 0.7 *32=22.4

0.06863 *32:

0.06 *32=1.92

0.00863 *32=0.27616

So 1.92 +0.27616=2.19616.

So 22.4 +2.19616 =24.59616.

So 64 +24.59616=88.59616 grams, which is approximately 88.6 grams.

Looking back at the options, option B is 88.5, which is the closest. So the correct answer should be B.

To determine how many grams of O₂ remain uncombined after the reaction, we start with the balanced chemical equation:

\[
\text{Si} + \text{O}_2 \rightarrow \text{SiO}_2
\]

### Step 1: Calculate moles of Si and O₂
- Molar mass of Si = 28.085 g/mol  
  Moles of Si = \( \frac{10.0}{28.085} \approx 0.356 \, \text{mol} \)  

- Molar mass of O₂ = 32.00 g/mol  
  Moles of O₂ = \( \frac{100.0}{32.00} = 3.125 \, \text{mol} \)  

### Step 2: Identify the limiting reactant
The reaction has a 1:1 molar ratio between Si and O₂. Since 0.356 mol of Si reacts with 0.356 mol of O₂, and we have 3.125 mol of O₂ available, Si is the limiting reactant. All 0.356 mol of Si will react, and the remaining O₂ will be:

\[
\text{Remaining O}_2 = 3.125 - 0.356 = 2.769 \, \text{mol}
\]

### Step 3: Convert remaining moles of O₂ to grams
Using the molar mass of O₂ (32.00 g/mol):

\[
\text{Mass of remaining O}_2 = 2.769 \times 32.00 \approx 88.6 \, \text{g}
\]

### Step 4: Match the closest option
The closest option to 88.6 g is **88.5 g**, which corresponds to **option B**.
