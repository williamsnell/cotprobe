Question:

Why is a retail sales tax of 4% not proportional but regressive?

Options:

A: The 4% retail sales tax decreases in percentage as the amount spent on consumption increases.
B: The 4% retail sales tax is regressive because it applies only to luxury goods, which lower income groups do not purchase.
C: The 4% retail sales tax is a flat tax, so it affects all income groups equally.
D: Lower income groups receive a subsidy that offsets the 4% retail sales tax.
E: Higher income groups pay more retail sales tax because they have more income.
F: Higher income groups are taxed at a higher rate with the 4% retail sales tax.
G: Lower income groups are exempt from the 4% retail sales tax.
H: The 4% retail sales tax is proportional because everyone pays the same rate.
I: The 4% retail sales tax is adjusted based on the buyer's income level, with higher incomes paying a lower percentage.
J: A 4% retail sales tax is regressive because lower income groups spend a greater proportion of their income on consumption, resulting in a higher effective rate of taxation for them compared to higher income groups.

Okay, so I have this question about why a 4% retail sales tax is not proportional but regressive. Hmm, I need to think through this carefully.

First, I remember that taxes can be proportional, progressive, or regressive. Proportional means everyone pays the same tax rate regardless of income. Progressive is where higher income people pay a higher rate, and regressive is the oppositeâ€”lower income people pay a higher rate relative to their income.

Wait, the question is about a sales tax. Sales taxes are usually a flat rate. So a 4% tax on purchases would mean everyone pays 4% on what they buy. But why is that regressive?

Oh right, because lower income people spend a larger portion of their income on necessities. They might spend almost all of their income on things like food, clothing, and shelter, which are subject to sales tax. Higher income people, on the other hand, can save more or invest, so they spend a smaller proportion of their income. So even though both pay the same 4% rate, the lower income group is paying a bigger chunk of their total income in taxes.

Looking at the options now. Option A says the tax decreases as spending increases. No, the rate stays the same, so A is wrong.

Option B claims it's regressive because it applies only to luxury goods that lower income groups don't buy. That doesn't make sense because sales tax usually applies to most goods, not just luxuries. So B is incorrect.

Option C says the tax is a flat tax affecting all equally. Flat tax would be proportional, but the question says it's not proportional. So C is wrong.

Option D talks about lower income getting subsidies. That's not related to why the tax is regressive. So D is out.

Option E says higher income pay more tax because they have more income. That's true in absolute terms, but the question is about the rate relative to income. So E doesn't explain regressiveness.

Option F says higher income groups are taxed at a higher rate. No, the rate is 4% for everyone, so F is incorrect.

Option G claims lower income are exempt, which isn't the case. So G is wrong.

Option H says it's proportional because same rate. But the question states it's not proportional, so H is incorrect.

Option I suggests the tax adjusts based on income, lowering for higher incomes. No, the tax is a flat 4%, so I is wrong.

Option J explains that lower income groups spend a larger proportion of their income on consumption, leading to a higher effective tax rate. That matches what I was thinking earlier.

So the correct answer must be J.

A retail sales tax of 4% is regressive because lower income groups spend a larger proportion of their income on consumption, resulting in a higher effective rate of taxation compared to higher income groups.
