Alright, so I've got this problem here about rounding gallons of gas. Let me try to work through it step by step. Okay, the question says a gas station sold 300.5849 gallons in a day, and we need to round this to the nearest hundredth. Hmm, I remember that the hundredth place is the second decimal digit, right? So like, in the number 300.58, the 8 is in the hundredth place.

Wait, let me make sure. The first place after the decimal is tenths, the second is hundredths, third is thousandths, and so on. So in 300.5849, the digits are: 5 tenths, 8 hundredths, 4 thousandths, 9 ten-thousandths. So yeah, we're looking to round to two decimal places.

The value given is 300.5849. I need to round this. So I should look at the digit right after the hundredth place, which is the thousandth place. That digit is 4. I remember that when rounding, if the next digit is 5 or above, you round up; if it's less than 5, you leave it as is.

So here, the next digit is 4, which is less than 5. That means I don't round up. So the hundredth place stays the same. So the number should be 300.58 when rounded to the nearest hundredth.

Wait, but let me double-check. The original number is 300.5849. So the two decimal places are .58. The next digit is 4, so it's 300.58... and since 4 is less than 5, we keep it as 300.58. So the answer should be 300.58.

Looking at the options, option D is 300.58, which matches what I got. But wait, let me make sure I didn't miscount the places. Let's write it out: 300.5849. The first decimal is 5, second is 8, third is 4. So yes, the third is 4, which is less than 5, so we don't change the 8. So the correct rounded number is 300.58, which is option D.

To determine how many gallons of gas the station sold, rounded to the nearest hundredth, we start with the given value: 300.5849. The hundredth place is the second digit after the decimal, which is 8. To round correctly, we look at the next digit (thousandth place), which is 4. Since 4 is less than 5, we do not round up, and the value remains 300.58.

Among the options provided, the correct answer is:

D: 300.58

Answer: D
