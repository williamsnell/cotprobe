Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about self-instructional training for impulsive children. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking what self-instructional training helps impulsive children do. The options are from A to F. Let me go through each one.

Option A: Use frequent breaks to manage energy levels. I think breaking tasks into smaller parts with breaks can help, but is that specifically about self-instructional training? Maybe, but I'm not sure yet.

Option B: Change their self-statements to increase task-oriented behavior. Oh wait, self-instructional training sounds like it involves teaching kids to talk to themselves, give themselves instructions. So this could be about cognitive-behavioral techniques where they learn to control their impulses by using positive self-talk or guiding statements. That makes sense.

Option C: More physical activities. Physical activity can help with impulsivity by burning off energy, but I'm not sure if that's part of self-instructional training. That seems more like a separate strategy, maybe behavioral or environmental.

Option D: Use electronic devices as distractions. That doesn't sound right. Distraction might not help with impulsivity; in fact, it could make it worse or just avoid the problem. Plus, self-instruction is more about internal strategies, not relying on devices.

Option E: Suppress impulses through punishment. Punishment might stop the behavior in the moment, but it's not teaching the child how to manage their impulses themselves. Self-instruction is about training, not punishment.

Option F: Increase social interactions. Social skills are important, but again, the question is about self-instructional training. That seems more about the child's internal processes than their interactions with others.

So putting it all together, self-instructional training is probably about teaching children to manage their own behavior through self-talk or self-guiding statements. That points to option B. I think that's the right answer because it's about changing their internal dialogue to stay focused and on task.

The correct answer is B: change their self-statements to increase their task-oriented behavior. Self-instructional training focuses on helping children manage their impulses by using internal strategies, such as positive self-talk, to guide their behavior and stay focused on tasks.

Answer: B
