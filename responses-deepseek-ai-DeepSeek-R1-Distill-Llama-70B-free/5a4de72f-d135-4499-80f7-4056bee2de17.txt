Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about group theory, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me break it down.

The question has two statements, Statement 1 and Statement 2, and I need to determine if each is true or false. Then, based on that, pick the right option from A to J.

Starting with Statement 1: If H is a subgroup of a group G and a belongs to G, then aH = Ha. Hmm. I remember that aH is the left coset, which is all elements of the form a*h where h is in H. Similarly, Ha is the right coset, h*a. So the statement claims that for any a in G, the left and right cosets are equal.

Wait, but when is this true? I think this happens if and only if H is a normal subgroup of G. Because in general, aH might not equal Ha unless H is normal. So if H is just a subgroup, not necessarily normal, then aH could be different from Ha. So Statement 1 is making a general claim that for any subgroup H, aH equals Ha, which can't be right. So Statement 1 must be false. Because it's only true when H is normal, but the statement doesn't specify that H is normal.

Now, moving on to Statement 2: If H is normal in G and a is in G, then a h = h a for all h in H. Wait, no, that's not correct. If H is normal, then it's closed under conjugation, meaning that aha^{-1} is in H for any a in G. But that doesn't mean that a and h commute, i.e., ah=ha. Unless G is abelian, which isn't specified here. So Statement 2 is saying that in a normal subgroup, every element of H commutes with every element of G. That's not generally true. For example, take G=S3, the symmetric group on 3 elements. H could be the alternating group A3, which is normal in S3. But elements of A3 don't commute with all elements of S3. For instance, a transposition (which is not in A3) when multiplied with an element of A3 might not commute. But wait, in this case, H is A3, and a is in G=S3. So for a being a transposition, say (12), and h being a 3-cycle like (123), then (12)(123) is not equal to (123)(12). Let me compute that. (12)(123) is (12)(123) = (23), because applying (123) first sends 1→2, 2→3, 3→1, then (12) swaps 1 and 2. So 1→2→3, 2→3→1, 3→1→1? Wait, maybe I should compute it more carefully. Alternatively, maybe pick another example to make it clearer. So, the point is, normal subgroups don't require their elements to commute with the entire group, only that the conjugation stays within H. So Statement 2 is false as well.

Wait, wait, wait. Let me think again. Statement 2 says that if H is normal and a is in G, then for all h in H, a h = h a. That's a strong statement because it's saying that every element of H is in the center of G, which is only true if H is central, i.e., H is contained in the center Z(G). But being normal doesn't imply being central. So Statement 2 is definitely false.

So both statements are false. Wait, wait. Let me make sure about Statement 1 again. Statement 1 says that for any subgroup H of G and any a in G, aH = Ha. As I thought earlier, this is only true if H is a normal subgroup of G. But the statement doesn't specify that H is normal, so it's making a general claim that's false. So Statement 1 is false, and Statement 2 is also false.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check the choices again. The options are from A to J, where each option gives the truth values of Statement 1 and Statement 2.

Option C is False, False. So according to my analysis, both statements are false, so the correct option would be C.

Wait, but wait another moment. Could I have made a mistake about Statement 1? Let me think again. Statement 1: If H is a subgroup of G and a is in G, then aH = Ha. As I thought, this is only true for normal subgroups, but if H is not normal, aH might not equal Ha. So yes, Statement 1 is false because it's asserting it without H being normal. So both statements are indeed false. So the correct answer is Option C: False, False.

Statement 1 claims that if \( H \) is a subgroup of \( G \) and \( a \in G \), then \( aH = Ha \). This is not generally true unless \( H \) is a normal subgroup of \( G \). Since the statement does not specify that \( H \) is normal, it is false.

Statement 2 asserts that if \( H \) is normal in \( G \) and \( a \in G \), then \( ah = ha \) for all \( h \in H \). This is also false because normality only guarantees that \( aHa^{-1} \subseteq H \), not that elements of \( H \) commute with all elements of \( G \). Normality does not imply centrality unless \( H \) is contained in the center of \( G \), which is not stated here.

Both statements are false. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: False, False**
