Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here. It's about finding the pH of a 0.25 M solution of sodium carbonate, Na2CO3. Hmm, I remember that sodium carbonate is a salt, right? And since it's a sodium salt, which comes from a strong base, NaOH, it should be a strong electrolyte. So when it dissolves in water, it should dissociate completely.

Wait, sodium carbonate is Na2CO3. So when it dissociates, it'll give 2 Na+ ions and one CO3^2- ion. Na+ is a spectator ion because it doesn't react in water. The carbonate ion, CO3^2-, is the conjugate base of carbonic acid, which I think is a weak acid. So carbonate will hydrolyze in water, making the solution basic. That's why the pH should be greater than 7.

The formula for the dissociation would be Na2CO3 → 2Na+ + CO3^2- in water. Then the carbonate ion reacts with water: CO3^2- + H2O ↔ HCO3^- + OH^-.

To find the pH, I need to find the concentration of OH- ions. Since Na2CO3 is a strong electrolyte, the initial concentration of CO3^2- is 0.25 M. Then, each mole of Na2CO3 gives one mole of CO3^2-, so [CO3^2-] is 0.25 M.

Now, the carbonate ion will hydrolyze: CO3^2- + H2O ↔ HCO3^- + OH^-. This is a base hydrolysis reaction, and I think I should use the Kb for carbonate to find the [OH-].

Wait, but I don't remember the exact Kb value for carbonate. I think carbonic acid has two dissociation steps. The first is H2CO3 ↔ H+ + HCO3^- with Ka1 around 4.4e-7, and the second is HCO3^- ↔ H+ + CO3^2- with Ka2 around 4.7e-11. So the Kb for CO3^2- would be the Kw divided by Ka2. Because for a conjugate base, Kb = Kw / Ka.

So Kb = (1e-14) / (4.7e-11) ≈ 2.13e-4. Let me calculate that: 1e-14 divided by 4.7e-11 is approximately 2.13e-4.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check that calculation. 4.7e-11 is 4.7 times 10^-11. So 1e-14 divided by 4.7e-11 equals (1 / 4.7) ) * 1e-3, which is about 0.213 * 1e-3, so 2.13e-4. Yep, that's right.

So now, the hydrolysis reaction is CO3^2- + H2O ↔ HCO3^- + OH^- with Kb = 2.13e-4.

I can set up an ICE table for this. Initial concentration of CO3^2- is 0.25 M, and the products (HCO3^- and OH^-) are 0. So:

Initial:
[CO3^2-] = 0.25
[HCO3^-] = 0
[OH^-] = 0

Change:
[CO3^2-] decreases by x
[HCO3^-] increases by x
[OH^-] increases by x

Equilibrium:
[CO3^2-] = 0.25 - x
[HCO3^-] = x
[OH^-] = x

The Kb expression is Kb = [HCO3^-][OH^-] / [CO3^2-] = (x)(x) / (0.25 - x) = x² / (0.25 - x) = 2.13e-4.

So the equation becomes x² = 2.13e-4 * (0.25 - x).

Assuming that x is small compared to 0.25, so 0.25 - x ≈ 0.25. Then x² = 2.13e-4 * 0.25 → x² ≈ 5.325e-5 → x ≈ sqrt(5.325e-5) ≈ 0.0073 M.

Wait, let me calculate the square root. 5.325e-5 is 5.325 * 1e-5. The square root of 5.325 is about 2.306, and square root of 1e-5 is 1e-2.5, which is about 3.16e-3. So 2.306 * 3.16e-3 ≈ 7.29e-3. Wait, wait, that doesn't match my earlier calculation. Did I do that right?

Wait, sqrt(5.325e-5) = sqrt(5.325) * sqrt(1e-5). sqrt(5.325) is approximately 2.306, and sqrt(1e-5) is 1e-2.5 which is 3.162e-3. So 2.306 * 3.162e-3 is about 7.3e-3. Wait, but that's 0.0073, which is 7.3 mM. So [OH-] is 0.0073 M.

Wait, but wait, I approximated 0.25 - x as 0.25, but x is 0.0073, which is about 3% of 0.25 (0.25 is 0.25, so 0.0073 is about 2.9% of 0.25, so the approximation may be acceptable. But perhaps I should check without the approximation.

Let me compute without the approximation. So x² = 2.13e-4 * (0.25 - x).

Expanding that: x² + 2.13e-4 x - (2.13e-4 * 0.25) = 0.

Which is x² + (2.13e-4) x - 5.325e-5 = 0.

Using quadratic formula: x = [-b ± sqrt(b² + 4ac)] / 2a.

Here, a = 1, b = 2.13e-4, c = -5.325e-5.

Discriminant D = (2.13e-4)^2 + 4 * 1 * 5.325e-5.

Calculating each term:

(2.13e-4)^2 = (2.13)^2 * 1e-8 ≈ 4.5369e-8.

4 * 5.325e-5 = 2.13e-4.

So D ≈ 4.5369e-8 + 2.13e-4 = 2.13345369e-4 approximately.

Wait, 4.5369e-8 is 0.000000045369, and 2.13e-4 is 0.000213. Adding them gives 0.000213 + 0.000000045369 = 0.000213045369.

So sqrt(D) = sqrt(2.133045369e-4) ≈ sqrt(2.133e-4) ≈ 0.0146.

So x = [-2.13e-4 ± 0.0146]/2.

We take the positive root: ( -2.13e-4 + 0.0146 ) / 2 = (0.0146 - 0.000213)/2 = (0.014387)/2 ≈ 0.0071935 M. So approx 0.0071935, which is around 0.00719 M.

So [OH-] ≈ 0.00719 M.

So pOH is -log10(0.00719). Let me calculate that.

Log(7.19e-3): log(7.19) is approx 0.857, so log(7.19e-3) is 0.857 -3 = -2.143. So pOH is 2.143.

Then pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 2.143 = 11.857. So about 11.86.

Looking at the options, option E is 11.83, which is close. Hmm, wait, but wait my calculation gave 11.86. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the Kb calculation. Let me recalculate Kb.

The second ionization of carbonic acid is HCO3^- ↔ H+ + CO3^2-, with Ka2 = 4.7e-11. So Kb for CO3^2- is Kw / Ka2 = (1e-14)/(4.7e-11) = (1)/(4.7e-11 / 1e-14) )= 1e-14 / 4.7e-11 = (1/4.7) * 1e3 = approx 0.213 * 1e3? Wait, no.

Wait, no, 1e-14 / 4.7e-11 = (1 / 4.7) ) * (1e-14 / 1e-11) ) = (0.2128) * (1e-3) ) = 2.128e-4. So Kb ≈ 2.128e-4.

So that part is correct. Then, in the ICE table, the setup is correct. So the quadratic solution gave x ≈ 0.0071935 M.

Then [OH-] is 0.0071935 M, so pOH is -log(0.0071935).

Calculating log(0.0071935):

log(7.1935e-3) = log(7.1935) + log(1e-3) = 0.857 (since log10(7)=0.845, log10(7.19)= closer to 0.857) → 0.857 -3 = -2.143 → pOH = 2.143 → pH=14-2.143=11.857.

So about 11.86, which is close to option E:11.83. Hmm, but wait, perhaps the exact value of Ka2 affects this. Maybe I should use the exact value.

Wait, I think I might have used an approximate value for Ka2. Let me check the exact value of Ka2 for carbonic acid. I think it's actually around 4.7 × 10^-11, so that part is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a more accurate calculation for the Kb. Let me recalculate it:

Kw = 1.0e-14

Ka2 = 4.7e-11

So Kb = (1e-14) / (4.7e-11) = (1 / 4.7) ) * (1e-14 / 1e-11) ) = (0.2128) * (1e-3) ) = 0.0002128, which is 2.128e-4.

So that's correct.

Then, the initial assumption for x being 0.00719, which is 2.9% of 0.25, so the approximation is acceptable. So our calculation is correct.

So the pH is approximately 11.86. Looking at the options, option E is 11.83 and option B is 11.50. So why the discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps the activity coefficients are being considered, but I think the problem assumes ideal behavior. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps.

Another approach: maybe using the approximation for Kb, but perhaps a more precise calculation. Alternatively, perhaps even considering that carbonate can hydrolyze further, but I think that's negligible because carbonate is a stronger base than bicarbonate.

Wait, another thought. Sodium carbonate is a strong electrolyte, so it dissociates completely. The solution is 0.25 M in CO3^2-. Then, the carbonate ion will hydrolyze as CO3^2- + H2O ↔ HCO3^- + OH^-.

Wait, but wait: the carbonate ion can also act as a base in a second step. No, wait, the carbonate is the conjugate base of bicarbonate, so it can only do one hydrolysis step to form bicarbonate and hydroxide. So our initial approach is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a calculation error in the quadratic formula. Let me recalculate the quadratic solution step by step.

From the equation:

x² + (2.128e-4)x - (2.128e-4)(0.25) = 0

So, x² + (2.128e-4)x - 5.32e-5 = 0

The quadratic formula: x = [ -b ± sqrt(b² + 4ac) ] / (2a)

Here, a=1, b=2.128e-4, c= -5.32e-5.

So,

Discriminant D = b² -4ac → Wait, no: in quadratic equation ax² + bx + c =0, D = b² -4ac. But in our equation, it's x² + (2.128e-4)x -5.32e-5 =0. So a=1, b=2.128e-4, c=-5.32e-5.

So D = (2.128e-4)^2 - 4(1)(-5.32e-5) = (4.53e-8) + (2.128e-4) = approximately 0.00021284.

Wait, 4.53e-8 is 0.0000000453, and 2.128e-4 is 0.0002128. So adding them gives 0.0002128 + 0.0000000453 = 0.0002128453.

So sqrt(D) is sqrt(0.0002128453) ≈ 0.0146.

So x = [ -2.128e-4 ± 0.0146 ] / 2.

Taking the positive root: (-0.0002128 + 0.0146)/2 = (0.0143872)/2 ≈ 0.0071936 M.

So x is 0.0071936 M, which is 7.1936e-3.

Then [OH-] is 0.0071936, so pOH is -log(0.0071936).

Let me compute that more accurately.

log(0.0071936) = log(7.1936 ×10^-3 ) = log(7.1936) + (-3).

log(7.1936): Let's break it down.

Log(7)=0.8451, log(7.1)=0.8513, log(7.19)=?

Using a calculator method: 7 × log(1.019...) ?

Wait, perhaps I should use a linear approximation between 7.1 and 7.2.

Wait, log(7.1) ≈ 0.8513.

log(7.2) ≈ 0.8573.

So 7.19 is 0.19 of the way from 7.1 to 7.2.

The difference between 0.8573 and 0.8513 is 0.006.

So 0.19 × 0.006 = 0.00114.

So log(7.19) ≈ 0.8513 + 0.00114 ≈ 0.85244.

So log(7.1936)= ~0.8525.

So log(7.1936e-3) = 0.8525 -3 = -2.1475.

So pOH = 2.1475.

Then pH = 14 - 2.1475 = 11.8525, so approximately 11.85.

Looking at the options, the closest is E:11.83, but also, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculations, or perhaps the given options don't include 11.85.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps I should consider the ionic strength and the effect on activity coefficients. But I think that's beyond the scope of this problem, as it's likely assuming ideal solution behavior.

Alternatively, maybe I should check if the approximation x <<0.25 is valid. x was 0.0071936, which is 2.9% of 0.25. So the approximation may have introduced a small error. But when I did the quadratic solution, I got x≈0.0071936, which is more precise.

So the pH is about 11.85, which is close to option E (11.83) but not exactly. Alternatively, perhaps the given options don't include 11.85, but perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the carbonate ion as a base and using the formula for weak bases: 

For a weak base, the pH can be calculated using the formula:

pH = 14 + ½ (pKb - log C)

Wait, let me think. The formula for a weak base is:

pOH = ½ (pKb - log [base])

Wait, the formula is pOH = ½ (pKb - log C), where C is the concentration of the base before hydrolysis.

So Kb is 2.128e-4, so pKb is log(1/(2.128e-4)).

Wait, pKb = -log(2.128e-4) ≈ 3.669.

Wait, let's compute that:

log(2.128e-4) = log(2.128) + (-4) → 0.3288 -4 = -3.6712 → pKb is 3.6712.

So, pOH = ½ (3.6712 - log(0.25)).

Log(0.25)= log(1/4)= -0.60206.

So pOH = ½ (3.6712 - (-0.60206)) → ½ (4.27326) → 2.1366.

So pH = 14 - 2.1366 = 11.8634, which is about 11.86. So same as before.

So the pH is approximately 11.86. Looking at the options given:

A: 9.21

B: 11.50

C:12.00

D:10.25

E:11.83

F:13.00

G:11.00

H:12.34

I:9.85

J:10.67

The closest option is E:11.83. But wait, my calculation says 11
