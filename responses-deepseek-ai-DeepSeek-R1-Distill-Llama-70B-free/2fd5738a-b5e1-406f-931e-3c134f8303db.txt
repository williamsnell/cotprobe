Okay, so I have this chemistry question about the dissociation of a polyprotic acid, specifically H3PO4. The question is asking me to rank the Bronsted-Lowry acids in order of decreasing strength. Hmm, I remember that Bronsted-Lowry acids are substances that donate protons, so the strength here refers to how readily each species donates a proton.

H3PO4 is a triprotic acid, which means it can donate three protons. The dissociation happens in steps. I think the first step is H3PO4 losing a proton to form H2PO4^- and H+. Then, H2PO4^- can lose another proton to become HPO4^2-, and so on. So the acids in the sequence would be H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, and finally PO4^3-.

Wait, but the question says the dissociation shows three Bronsted-Lowry acids. Oh right, because each deprotonation step gives a new acid. So the acids are each of these species except the last, which is the conjugate base. So the three acids are H3PO4, H2PO4^-, and HPO4^2-.

Now, I need to rank them in order of decreasing strength. I remember that for polyprotic acids, each subsequent acid is weaker than the previous one. So the first acid (H3PO4) is the strongest, then the next (H2PO4^-) is weaker, and the third (HPO4^2-) is the weakest. Because as you lose protons, the remaining protons are held more tightly, making it harder to lose them, thus weaker acids.

So the order should be H3PO4 > H2PO4^- > HPO4^2-.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option H says H3PO4, H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-. That's the order I just thought of. Option A is H2PO4^-, HPO4^2-, H3PO4, which is the reverse. Option J has H3PO4 first, then HPO4^2-, which would be weaker than H2PO4^-—so that's not correct. Option H seems right.

Wait, did I mix up anything? Let me double-check. The strength decreases with each deprotonation. So the first proton is easiest to lose, so H3PO4 is the strongest. Then H2PO4^- donates a proton to become HPO4^2-, so H2PO4^- is the next strongest. Then HPO4^2- donates a proton to become PO4^3-, so it's the weakest of the three.

Yes, so the correct order is H3PO4 (strongest), then H2PO4^-, then HPO4^2- (weakest). Looking at the options, that's option H.

The dissociation of H₃PO₄, a triprotic acid, occurs in three steps, producing three Bronsted-Lowry acids: H₃PO₄, H₂PO₄⁻, and HPO₄²⁻. The strength of these acids decreases with each successive deprotonation because the remaining protons are held more tightly, making it harder to donate them. 

1. **H₃PO₄** is the strongest acid because it is the fully protonated species and donates the first proton most readily.
2. **H₂PO₄⁻** is weaker than H₃PO₄ because it has already lost one proton, and the remaining protons are less readily donated.
3. **HPO₄²⁻** is the weakest acid among the three because it has lost two protons, and the remaining proton is even more tightly held.

Thus, the correct order of decreasing acid strength is **H₃PO₄ > H₂PO₄⁻ > HPO₄²⁻**. Among the given options, only **Option H** matches this order.
