Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about lenses. Hmm, let me try to think through it step by step. I remember that this has to do with the lens formula and maybe the magnification. Right, the lens formula is 1/f = 1/do + 1/di, where f is the focal length, do is the object distance, and di is the image distance.

The problem states that the distance between the object and its real image is 32 inches. Wait, so the total distance between them is do + di = 32 inches. Got that. And the image is three times as large as the object, so the magnification m is 3. Oh wait, but wait, is the image upright or inverted? Because if it's a real image formed by a convex lens, it's inverted, so the magnification would be negative. But maybe the sign doesn't matter right now, I'll just use the magnitude for the ratio.

So magnification m is given by m = -di/do. Since the image is real, m should be negative, but considering size, m is 3. So 3 = di/do. Wait, but since m is negative, maybe di is negative times do times 3? Wait, no, let me think again. The magnification formula is m = hi/ho = -di/do. So if the image is 3 times as large, then |m|=3. So di = -3 do. Because the image is inverted, the di would be positive if on the opposite side, but wait, in the sign conventions, for lenses, do is positive when the object is on the same side as the incoming light, which is the real object case. And di is positive when the image is on the opposite side, which is the case for real images. So m would be negative because image is inverted, so m = -3 = -di/do → di = 3 do.

Wait, but wait. So m is -di/do, and if |m|=3, then di/do = 3, so di=3do. So that's correct.

And the total distance is do + di = 32 → do + 3 do = 4 do =32 → do = 8 inches. So di would be 24 inches.

Wait, so do is 8, di is 24. Now, using the lens formula: 1/f = 1/do + 1/di → 1/f = 1/8 + 1/24. Let me compute that. 1/8 is 0.125, 1/24 is approximately 0.0416667. Adding them gives 0.1666667. So 1/f = 0.1666667 → f = 1 / (1/6) = 6 inches. So the focal length is 6 inches. Do is 8 inches, di is 24 inches. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option D says focal length 6 inches, object 8 inches, image 24 inches. So that's exactly what I got. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up any signs. Oh wait, in the lens formula, for a real image, di is positive, which it is. So all the calculations are correct. Yeah, I think D is the right answer.

To solve the problem, we use the lens formula:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}
\]

and the magnification formula:

\[
m = -\frac{d_i}{d_o}
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the given information
- The distance between the object and the image is \( d_o + d_i = 32 \) inches.
- The image is 3 times as large as the object, so the magnification is \( |m| = 3 \).

From the magnification formula, \( m = -\frac{d_i}{d_o} \), and since the image is inverted, \( m = -3 \). This gives:

\[
\frac{d_i}{d_o} = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad d_i = 3d_o
\]

### Step 2: Solve for \( d_o \) and \( d_i \)
Using \( d_o + d_i = 32 \) and substituting \( d_i = 3d_o \):

\[
d_o + 3d_o = 32 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 4d_o = 32 \quad \Rightarrow \quad d_o = 8 \, \text{inches}
\]

\[
d_i = 3d_o = 3(8) = 24 \, \text{inches}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the focal length
Using the lens formula:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}
\]

Substitute \( d_o = 8 \) and \( d_i = 24 \):

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{24}
\]

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{3}{24} + \frac{1}{24} = \frac{4}{24} = \frac{1}{6}
\]

\[
f = 6 \, \text{inches}
\]

### Step 4: Match with the options
From the calculations:
- Focal length \( f = 6 \, \text{inches} \)
- Object distance \( d_o = 8 \, \text{inches} \)
- Image distance \( d_i = 24 \, \text{inches} \)

This matches **Option D**.
