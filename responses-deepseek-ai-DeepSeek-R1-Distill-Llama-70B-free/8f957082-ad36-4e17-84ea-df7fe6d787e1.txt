Question:

A TCP entity sends 6 segments across the Internet. The measured round-trip times (RTTM) for the 6 segments are 68ms, 42ms, 65ms, 80ms, 38ms, and 75ms, respectively. Assume that the smooth averaged RTT (RTTs) and Deviation (RTTD) was respectively 70ms and 10ms just before the first of these six samples. According to the Jacobson's algorithm, the retransmission timeout (RTO) is given by one RTTs plus 4 times the value of RTTD. Determine the value of RTO (in ms) after the six segments using the Jacobson's algorithm if the exponential smoothing parameters (a and B) are 0.15 and 0.2 for calculating RTTs and RTTD respectively.

Okay, so I've got this problem about TCP retransmission timeout (RTO) using Jacobson's algorithm. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The problem says that there are six segments sent, each with their own RTTM values. The initial RTTs is 70 ms and RTTD is 10 ms before the first segment. The parameters a and B are 0.15 and 0.2 respectively for calculating the new RTTs and RTTD.

Wait, Jacobson's algorithm uses these parameters to smooth the RTT and deviation. So each time a new RTTM comes in, we update RTTs and RTTD based on these a and B values.

The formula for RTTs (smoothed round-trip time) is RTTs = (1 - a) * old RTTs + a * new RTTM. Similarly, for RTTD, it's a bit different. Oh right, RTTD is calculated as (1 - B) * old RTTD + B * |RTTM - RTTs|, but wait, actually, I think RTTD is updated after RTTs. So for each new RTTM, we first calculate the new RTTs, then calculate the deviation from that new RTTs.

So for each of the six segments, I need to calculate the new RTTs and RTTD step by step.

Let me list the RTTMs in order: 68,42,65,80,38,75.

Starting values:
RTTs_initial = 70 ms
RTTD_initial = 10 ms.

Let me go through each segment one by one.

First segment: RTTM = 68 ms.

Compute new RTTs:
RTTs = (1 - a) * old RTTs + a * RTTM
a is 0.15, so 1 - a = 0.85.

RTTs1 = 0.85 * 70 + 0.15 * 68. Let me calculate that.

0.85 *70 = 59.5, 0.15*68=10.2 → 59.5 +10.2=69.7 ms.

Now compute the deviation for RTTD.

The difference is |68 - 69.7| = 1.7 ms.

RTTD is updated as (1 - B)*old RTTD + B * new_diff.

B is 0.2, so 1-B=0.8.

RTTD1 = 0.8 *10 + 0.2 *1.7 → 8 + 0.34 = 8.34 ms.

Second segment: RTTM=42 ms.

Compute RTTs2:

RTTs2 = 0.85 * 69.7 + 0.15 *42.

0.85 *69.7 → let me calculate that. 70 *0.85 is 59.5, but 69.7 is 0.3 less than 70. So 0.85 *0.3 =0.255, subtract that from 59.5 → 59.5-0.255=59.245.

0.15 *42 =6.3 → 59.245 +6.3 =65.545 ms.

Now the difference for RTTD: |42 -65.545|=23.545 ms.

RTTD2 = 0.8 *8.34 +0.2 *23.545.

0.8 *8.34 is 6.672. 0.2 *23.545 is 4.709.

6.672 +4.709=11.381 ms.

Third segment: RTTM=65 ms.

Compute RTTs3:

0.85 *65.545 +0.15 *65.

0.85 *65 is 55.25. 0.85 *0.545=0.46225. So total 55.25 +0.46225=55.71225.

0.15 *65=9.75. So RTTs3 =55.71225 +9.75=65.46225 ms? Wait, wait, no. Wait, RTTs2 was 65.545, right? So 0.85 *65.545 → let me recalculate that.

Wait, 65.545 *0.85: 65 *0.85 is 55.25, 0.545 *0.85=0.46225. So 55.25 +0.46225=55.71225. Then add 0.15 *65=9.75 → 55.71225 +9.75=65.46225.

Difference is |65 -65.46225|=0.46225 ms.

RTTD3 =0.8 *11.381 +0.2 *0.46225.

0.8 *11.381 is 9.1048. 0.2 *0.46225 is 0.09245 → sum is 9.19725 ms.

Fourth segment: RTTM=80 ms.

RTTs4 =0.85 *65.46225 +0.15 *80.

Calculate 0.85 *65.46225: 65 *0.85 is 55.25, 0.46225 *0.85 is about 0.3924. So 55.25 +0.3924 =55.6424.

0.15 *80=12 → 55.6424 +12=67.6424 ms.

Difference: |80 -67.6424|=12.3576 ms.

RTTD4=0.8 *9.19725 +0.2 *12.3576.

0.8 *9.19725=7.3578. 0.2 *12.3576=2.4715 → sum is 9.8293 ms.

Fifth segment: RTTM=38 ms.

RTTs5 =0.85 *67.6424 +0.15 *38.

0.85 *67.6424: Let me compute 67 *0.85=56.95, 0.6424 *0.85= approx 0.546. So 56.95 +0.546=57.496.

0.15 *38=5.7 → 57.496 +5.7=63.196 ms.

Difference: |38 -63.196|=25.196 ms.

RTTD5=0.8 *9.8293 +0.2 *25.196.

0.8 *9.8293=7.8634. 0.2 *25.196=5.0392 → sum is 12.9026 ms.

Sixth segment: RTTM=75 ms.

RTTs6=0.85 *63.196 +0.15 *75.

0.85 *63.196 → 63 *0.85=53.55. 0.196 *0.85=0.1666 → 53.55 +0.1666=53.7166.

0.15 *75=11.25 → 53.7166 +11.25=64.9666 ms.

Difference: |75 -64.9666|=10.0334 ms.

RTTD6=0.8 *12.9026 +0.2 *10.0334.

0.8 *12.9026=10.3221. 0.2 *10.0334=2.0067 → sum=12.3288 ms.

So after all six segments, RTTs is approximately 64.9666 ms, and RTTD is 12.3288 ms.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the RTTs calculations, perhaps somewhere along the way. Let me double-check a few steps to make sure.

Let me recalculate RTTs after each step, perhaps I messed up somewhere.

First segment: RTTM=68.

RTTs1 = 0.85 *70 + 0.15 *68 → 59.5 +10.2=69.7 → correct.

Second RTTM=42:

RTTs2= 0.85 *69.7 +0.15 *42 → 0.85*69.7 is (70-0.3)*0.85 → 59.5 - 0.255=59.245. 0.15*42=6.3 → 59.245+6.3=65.545 → correct.

Third RTTM=65 → RTTs3=0.85*65.545 +0.15*65.

So 65.545 *0.85: Let me compute 65 *0.85=55.25. 0.545 *0.85=0.46225 → sum 55.71225. 0.15*65=9.75 → sum 65.46225 → correct.

Fourth RTTM=80 → RTTs4=0.85*65.46225 +0.15*80.

65.46225 *0.85: Let me compute 65 *0.85=55.25, 0.46225 *0.85=0.3924125 → sum 55.6424125. 0.15*80=12 → 55.6424125 +12=67.6424125 → correct.

Fifth RTTM=38 → RTTs5=0.85 *67.6424125 +0.15 *38.

67.6424125 *0.85: 67 *0.85=56.95, 0.6424125 *0.85≈0.546. So 56.95 +0.546=57.496. 0.15*38=5.7 → sum 63.196 → correct.

Sixth RTTM=75 → RTTs6=0.85*63.196 +0.15*75.

63.196 *0.85: 63*0.85=53.55, 0.196*0.85=0.1666 → sum 53.7166. 0.15*75=11.25 → 53.7166 +11.25=64.9666 → correct.

So RTTs is approximately 64.9666 ms, RTTD is 12.3288 ms.

Now, RTO is calculated as RTTs + 4 * RTTD.

So RTO = 64.9666 + 4 *12.3288 → 64.9666 +49.3152 =114.2818 ms.

Looking at the options, option C is 114.28. So the answer should be C.

To determine the retransmission timeout (RTO) after the six segments using Jacobson's algorithm, we start with initial values of **RTTs = 70 ms** and **RTTD = 10 ms**. The exponential smoothing parameters are **a = 0.15** for RTTs and **B = 0.2** for RTTD. The round-trip times (RTTM) for the six segments are: **68 ms, 42 ms, 65 ms, 80 ms, 38 ms, and 75 ms**.

### Step 1: Update RTTs and RTTD for each segment
The formulas used are:
- **RTTs = (1 - a) * old RTTs + a * RTTM**
- **RTTD = (1 - B) * old RTTD + B * |RTTM - RTTs|**

#### First segment (RTTM = 68 ms):
- **RTTs = 0.85 * 70 + 0.15 * 68 = 69.7 ms**
- **RTTD = 0.8 * 10 + 0.2 * |68 - 69.7| = 8.34 ms**

#### Second segment (RTTM = 42 ms):
- **RTTs = 0.85 * 69.7 + 0.15 * 42 = 65.545 ms**
- **RTTD = 0.8 * 8.34 + 0.2 * |42 - 65.545| = 11.381 ms**

#### Third segment (RTTM = 65 ms):
- **RTTs = 0.85 * 65.545 + 0.15 * 65 = 65.462 ms**
- **RTTD = 0.8 * 11.381 + 0.2 * |65 - 65.462| = 9.197 ms**

#### Fourth segment (RTTM = 80 ms):
- **RTTs = 0.85 * 65.462 + 0.15 * 80 = 67.642 ms**
- **RTTD = 0.8 * 9.197 + 0.2 * |80 - 67.642| = 9.829 ms**

#### Fifth segment (RTTM = 38 ms):
- **RTTs = 0.85 * 67.642 + 0.15 * 38 = 63.196 ms**
- **RTTD = 0.8 * 9.829 + 0.2 * |38 - 63.196| = 12.903 ms**

#### Sixth segment (RTTM = 75 ms):
- **RTTs = 0.85 * 63.196 + 0.15 * 75 = 64.967 ms**
- **RTTD = 0.8 * 12.903 + 0.2 * |75 - 64.967| = 12.329 ms**

### Step 2: Calculate RTO
After processing all six segments, the final values are:
- **RTTs = 64.967 ms**
- **RTTD = 12.329 ms**

The RTO is given by:
\[
\text{RTO} = \text{RTTs} + 4 \times \text{RTTD}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\text{RTO} = 64.967 + 4 \times 12.329 = 64.967 + 49.316 = 114.283 \, \text{ms}
\]

### Final Answer:
The closest option to the calculated RTO is **114.28 ms**, which corresponds to **option C**.

**Answer: C**
