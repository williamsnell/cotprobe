Okay, so I’ve got this multiple-choice question here about statistics, specifically about identifying the population of interest in a survey. Let me try to work through it step by step.

The question says that a school committee member wants to increase the gasoline tax to support the county school system. The local newspaper did a survey to see how county residents feel about this increase. And the question is asking, what's the population of interest in this scenario?

Alright, so I remember that in statistics, the population of interest (or target population) is the entire group that the researcher is interested in understanding or describing. It's the group to which they want to generalize their findings. The sample is the subset of that population that they actually study.

In this case, the school committee member is looking to get support from the county residents. The newspaper conducted a survey of these residents. So the goal is to assess the opinions of all the county residents because the tax increase would affect them, and their support is what's being measured.

Looking at the options:

A: All teachers in the county school system. Well, teachers are part of the county residents, but the survey is about all residents, not just teachers. So I don't think this is the right answer.

B: All residents in the local newspaper distribution area. Hmm, the newspaper's distribution area might not cover the entire county. Maybe they only deliver to certain parts. So the survey might not reach everyone in the county, but the population of interest is all county residents, not just those who get the newspaper. So B might not be correct.

C: All county residents with children in the county school system. This narrows it down to parents, but the tax affects everyone, even those without children. So the population is broader than just parents. So C might not be right.

D: All parents of children in the county school system. Similar to C, this is only a subset. The tax is for everyone, so the population should include all residents, not just parents. So D is probably not it.

E: All school committee members. That’s a very small group, just the committee. The survey is about public opinion, so E doesn’t make sense.

F: All county residents with school-aged children. Again, this is a specific group. But the tax would impact all residents regardless of whether they have school-aged children. So F isn’t the population of interest.

G: All county residents who pay gasoline tax. Well, most residents probably pay gasoline tax, but the population is all county residents, whether they pay it or not. But wait, the tax is on gasoline, so maybe the survey is only about those who pay it. Hmm, but the question is about the population of interest for assessing support. I think the committee wants to know all residents' opinions, because the tax affects everyone in the county, even if some don't drive and thus don't pay gas tax. But maybe G is a possible option. I'm a bit confused here.

H: All county residents. This seems straightforward. The survey is intended to gauge the opinions of everyone in the county, so H looks correct.

I: All school-aged children. That’s definitely too narrow. Children might not pay taxes or vote, so the survey is probably targeting adults. So I is incorrect.

J: All local newspaper readers. This is similar to B. The survey was conducted by the newspaper, but the population of interest isn't just the readers—it's all county residents. So J is not the right choice.

So, considering all this, the population of interest is all county residents. The correct answer should be H.

The population of interest in this scenario is all county residents, as the survey aims to assess their support for the gasoline tax increase. 

Answer: H
