Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the DSM-III and anxiety disorders. I'm a bit rusty on my DSM history, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that DSM-III was a significant revision in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, published in 1980. It introduced a more structured approach with specific criteria for each disorder. Before that, DSM-II was more psychoanalytic and less structured.

The question is specifically about anxiety disorders in DSM-III. I'm trying to recall how anxiety disorders were categorized back then. I think prior to DSM-III, anxiety was a broad category, but DSM-III broke it down into more specific disorders.

I remember that DSM-III introduced several specific anxiety disorders. Let me try to list them:

1. Panic Disorder: I'm pretty sure this was introduced in DSM-III. It's when someone has recurrent panic attacks.

2. Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD): Yeah, GAD was definitely there. It's the chronic anxiety, worry, etc., that's not focused on any specific thing.

3. Phobic Disorders: These were split into different types like agoraphobia, social phobia, and specific phobias. So Phobic Disorder as a category with subtypes.

4. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD): I think OCD was categorized under anxiety disorders in DSM-III. Although later editions moved it to its own category, but in III, it was part of anxiety.

5. Atypical Anxiety Disorder: This was a residual category for anxiety symptoms that didn't fit into the other specific disorders. So if someone had anxiety symptoms but didn't meet the criteria for any of the above, they'd get this diagnosis.

So that's five subtypes: Panic, GAD, Phobic, OCD, and Atypical.

Now looking at the options:

Option J says: Five subtypes including all five I listed. So that's looking correct.

Option F says only two: Panic and GAD. That's definitely not enough, since I know there were more.

Option G says six, including stress disorder. Wait, stress disordersâ€”like PTSD? I think PTSD was introduced in DSM-III, but was it under anxiety disorders? Or was it a separate category? I'm not sure. Wait, no, in DSM-III, PTSD was under "Adjustment Disorders" or maybe "Stress Disorders," but I think it was a separate category, not under anxiety. So maybe G is incorrect because it mentions stress disorder as a subtype, but I'm not certain if stress disorders were part of anxiety in III.

Option I says four subtypes, excluding atypical. But I thought atypical was included, so this would be incorrect.

So the correct answer should be J. Five subtypes including all five mentioned.

The DSM-III, published in 1980, introduced specific anxiety disorders, breaking away from broader categorizations. It included five subtypes: Panic Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Phobic Disorders, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, and Atypical Anxiety Disorder. These were distinct and represented a structured approach to diagnosis.

Among the options provided, only option J correctly lists these five subtypes. Other options either miscount the number of subtypes or include disorders not classified under anxiety in DSM-III.

Answer: J
