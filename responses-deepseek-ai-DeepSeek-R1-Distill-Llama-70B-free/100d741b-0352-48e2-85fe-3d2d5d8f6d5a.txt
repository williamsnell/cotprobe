Question:

In 2006, an investor purchased a 100-acre tract located in a rural county. Shortly thereafter, the investor prepared a subdivision plan that created 90 one-acre residential building lots on this tract with the remaining 10-acre lot proposed for a public school building. In the investor's sales brochure promoting the subdivision, he stated that "in addition to the close proximity of the proposed school for subdivision residents, the county school district would not need to expend tax money to acquire this property for school construction. " In 2007, the subdivision plan was recorded with the county recorder's office. On January 15, 2009, the county school board voted to build a new school on the 10-acre tract. The investor's proposed designation of the 1 0-acre tract for construction of a school building would best be described as a (an)

Options:

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this real estate question. Let me read through it again and see if I can figure it out. 

So, the scenario is about an investor who buys a 100-acre tract in a rural county in 2006. Then, he creates a subdivision plan, dividing it into 90 one-acre residential lots and a 10-acre lot for a public school. In his sales brochure, he mentions that the school will be close and that the county won't have to spend tax money to acquire the property. In 2007, the subdivision plan is recorded. Then, in 2009, the school board votes to build a school on the 10-acre tract.

The question is asking what the investor's designation of the 10-acre tract for the school would be called. The options are various real estate terms like easements, covenants, liens, etc.

Hmm. Let's think about what each term means. 

An easement is a right to use someone else's land for a specific purpose. It can be appurtenant (benefiting a neighboring property) or in gross (benefiting a person or entity, not tied to land). But the investor is designating land for a school, which is a public use. So maybe an easement for public use? That's option B.

Wait, but easements are usually about using the land, not necessarily conveying it for a specific purpose. The investor is setting aside land for the school, so it's more like dedicating it for that use. Maybe it's a restrictive covenant? Restrictive covenants are agreements that restrict how land can be used. They're often in subdivisions to maintain certain standards. But in this case, the investor is not restricting the use; he's designating it for a school. So maybe that's not it.

Option A is equitable servitude. I'm a bit fuzzy on that. Equitable servitudes are like restrictions on land use enforced in equity. They can be created through deeds or other writings. They're similar to restrictive covenants. But again, this seems more about dedicating land for a specific use rather than a restriction.

Option F is restrictive covenant. Wait, that's the same as I just thought. Maybe that's not the right category here.

What about an equitable servitude? If the investor includes a provision in the deeds or subdivision plan that this land is for a school, that could be an equitable servitude. Because it's a promise that runs with the land, enforceable in equity. But does that fit here?

Wait, another thought: when a developer sets aside land for public use, like a park or school, it's sometimes done through a dedication. Dedication is when the owner offers the land for public use, and the public entity accepts it. Once it's accepted, it becomes public property. But in this case, the investor recorded the subdivision plan in 2007, which included the 10-acre lot for the school. Then, the school board voted to build in 2009. So maybe the recording was an offer of dedication, and the school board's acceptance made it official. But the question is about the investor's action, not the acceptance.

So the investor's designation would be an offer to dedicate the land for public use. But the options don't include 'dedication' explicitly. Let me look at the options again. Option B is an easement for public use. But an easement doesn't transfer ownership; it just gives a right to use. Here, the investor is setting aside the land for the school, implying that the school would own it or have a right to use it. Alternatively, maybe it's a dedication, which is a form of conveyance.

Wait, but the options don't have 'dedication' as a choice. So I need to pick the closest one. 

Option B is 'easement for public use.' An easement in gross for public use would allow the public to use the land, but the owner still retains ownership. But in this case, the investor's statement says the county wouldn't need to spend tax money to acquire the property. That suggests that the 10-acre lot is being given to the county, meaning a transfer of ownership, not just an easement. Because if it were an easement, the county could use it but wouldn't own it. So perhaps the investor is conveying the land, which would be a fee simple transfer, but that's not one of the options here.

Wait, maybe the investor is creating a restrictive covenant that requires this land to be used as a school. But restrictive covenants usually restrict what can be built, not dedicating it for a specific use. Alternatively, it's a servitude that the land must be used for a school, which would be an equitable servitude.

Alternatively, when a subdivision is recorded, any dedications or offers for public use (like streets, parks, schools) are typically included in the plat. This is often considered a dedication, which is a form of conveyance to the public entity. But again, the term 'dedication' isn't an option here.

Looking back at the options, the closest might be an 'easement for public use' (option B). Or maybe it's a restrictive covenant (F), but I don't think so. Alternatively, an equitable servitude (A), but I'm not certain.

Wait, another angle: when a developer records a subdivision plan that includes areas for public facilities, that's a form of dedication, which is an offer to convey that land to the public entity. Once the public entity accepts, it's a done deal. But in this case, the subdivision plan was recorded in 2007, and the school board accepted in 2009. So the investor's action in the subdivision plan would be the offer. But the question is about what the designation is called, not the process.

So the designation would be a dedication, but since that's not an option, perhaps the closest is an easement for public use. Alternatively, an equitable servitude.

Wait, another thought: an easement for public use is often called a public easement. But in this case, the investor is not granting an easement over the 90 lots; he's designating a specific 10-acre lot for the school. So perhaps it's a dedication of that lot for public use, which would be a type of easement in gross or a fee simple conveyance.

But the options given don't include dedication. So perhaps the best fit is an equitable servitude, where the land is burdened with a restriction that it must be used for a school. Alternatively, an easement for public use.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of each option:

A: Equitable servitude – a restriction on use enforced in equity.

B: Easement for public use – right for the public to use the land.

C: Invalid legal agreement – probably not, since the plan was recorded.

D: Implied easement – based on use, not something recorded.

E: Adverse possession – not relevant here.

F: Restrictive covenant – similar to equitable servitude, but maybe more about limiting use.

G: Real estate lien – a financial interest, not applicable.

H: Unenforceable restriction – but the plan was recorded, so likely enforceable.

I: Right of way easement – specific type, but for access, not for a school.

J: Zoning regulation – a government rule, but this is a private action.

So options are narrowing down to A, B, F.

If the investor includes in the subdivision plan that a lot is for a school, that's a form of dedication. But since 'dedication' isn't an option, perhaps the closest is an equitable servitude, which is a restriction on the land's use. So the investor is imposing a servitude that the land must be used for a school. Alternatively, it's an easement allowing the school to be built there.

Wait, but an easement doesn't transfer ownership. So if the school is built, the investor would still own the land, and the school has an easement to use it. But that doesn't make sense because schools are typically owned by the school district. So perhaps the investor is conveying the land, but that's not an easement.

Wait, maybe the subdivision plan's designation of the 10-acre lot as a school site is a dedication. But again, that term isn't present. So perhaps the answer is an equitable servitude.

Alternatively, the investor is creating a restrictive covenant in the subdivision that this lot must be used for a school. So that would be a restrictive covenant (F).

Wait, but restrictive covenants are typically negative – like you can’t build a certain type of structure. This is more of a positive covenant, requiring the land to be used for a school. But I'm not sure if that's the same as a restrictive covenant.

Hmm. Maybe the correct answer is an equitable servitude because it's a restriction on the use of the land, enforceable in equity, and it's intended to benefit the public (the school). So that would make it an equitable servitude.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to think of definitions again:

- Easement: a right to use the land, doesn't transfer ownership.

- Restrictive covenant: an agreement that restricts the use of the land.

- Equitable servitude: similar to a restrictive covenant but enforced in equity, often through injunctions.

- Dedication: an offer to convey land for public use, which is accepted by the public entity.

Since dedication isn't an option, perhaps the investor's action is best described as an offer of dedication, but the question is about the designation, which would be a servitude or easement.

Alternatively, perhaps the investor's statement in the brochure and the subdivision plan constitute a dedication. But since that's not an option, perhaps the answer is an easement for public use.

Wait, but the investor is not granting a right to use the land; he's setting aside the land for the school to own. So maybe it's a fee simple conveyance, but that's not among the options.

Alternatively, if the subdivision plan includes the dedication, that might be considered an offer, which when accepted by the school board, completes the dedication. But the question is about the investor's action, which was the offer.

Wait, but the options don't include dedication, so perhaps the correct term in the options is B: easement for public use.

No, wait. An easement for public use would mean the public has the right to use the land, but the investor still owns it. Whereas in this case, the school would likely own the land, so it's more of a dedication than an easement.

But since dedication isn't an option, I'm stuck.

Wait, maybe the answer is F: restrictive covenant. Because the subdivision plan includes a restriction that the 10-acre lot is for a school. So any future owner of that lot is bound by that covenant. But restrictive covenants are typically for the benefit of other lot owners, not for the public. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps it's an equitable servitude because it's a restriction that's intended to benefit the public (the school being available for the subdivision residents), and it's enforceable against the land.

Wait, but equitable servitudes usually benefit the surrounding landowners, not the general public.

I'm a bit confused here. Let me think about what each term implies.

An easement for public use (option B) would allow the public to use the land, but the owner retains ownership. So if the school is built, the public can use it, but the land is still owned by the investor. But the question mentions that the county wouldn't have to spend money to acquire the land, implying that the land is being given to the county. So maybe the investor is transferring ownership, which would be a dedication, but that's not an option.

Wait, perhaps the investor is creating a public easement over the 10-acre lot, allowing the school to be built there. But again, that wouldn't transfer ownership; it would just allow use.

I'm going in circles. Let's try to eliminate options.

Option C: invalid legal agreement – I don't think so, since the subdivision plan was recorded.

Option D: implied easement – no, because it's explicitly stated.

Option E: adverse possession – no, that's about gaining title through use.

Option G: real estate lien – no, that's a financial interest.

Option H: unenforceable restriction – probably not, as it's recorded.

Option I: right of way easement – specific for access, not a school.

Option J: zoning regulation – a government action, not a private one.

So down to A, B, F.

Between these, I think the best fit is an easement for public use (B). Because the investor is allowing the public (the school) to use the land. But I'm not entirely confident because I thought dedication was the term, but it's not an option.

Alternatively, it's a restrictive covenant (F), but that's usually for the benefit of neighboring landowners, not the public.

Wait, another thought: the investor's statement in the brochure is part of the sales pitch, which might be considered a representation. But the question is about the legal designation, not the marketing.

Wait, another angle: when a subdivision is recorded, any areas designated for public use (like schools, parks) are considered to be dedicated to public use. So this would be a dedication, which is a form of conveyance. But since 'dedication' isn't an option, perhaps the closest is an easement for public use (B). Alternatively, maybe it's a restrictive covenant that the land must be used for a school, but that's not the usual purpose of restrictive covenants.

I think I've got to make a choice. Since the investor is designating the land for a school, which is a public use, the term that fits is an easement for public use. So the answer would be B.

The question revolves around an investor who purchases a 100-acre tract, subdivides it into 90 residential lots and a 10-acre lot for a public school, and records the subdivision plan in 2007. The school board later votes to build a school on the 10-acre tract in 2009. The task is to determine the legal term that best describes the investor's designation of the 10-acre lot for the school.

Key analysis of the options:

- **A: Equitable servitude**  
  An equitable servitude is a restriction on land use enforced in equity. While it could apply here, the investor's action seems more about dedicating land for public use rather than imposing a restriction.

- **B: Easement for public use**  
  An easement for public use allows the public to use the land, but the owner retains ownership. This does not fully align with the scenario, as the investor's statement suggests the county would not need to acquire the land, implying a transfer of ownership rather than just a right to use.

- **C: Invalid legal agreement**  
  This is unlikely, as the subdivision plan was recorded, indicating a valid legal action.

- **D: Implied easement**  
  An implied easement arises from use or necessity, which is not relevant here since the designation was explicitly stated in the subdivision plan.

- **E: Adverse possession**  
  This involves gaining title through unauthorized use and is irrelevant to the scenario.

- **F: Restrictive covenant**  
  Restrictive covenants typically restrict land use for the benefit of neighboring landowners. While the 10-acre lot is restricted for a specific use, this is for public benefit, not neighboring landowners, making this option less fitting.

- **G: Real estate lien**  
  A lien is a financial interest in property, which does not apply here.

- **H: Unenforceable restriction**  
  Since the subdivision plan was recorded, the designation is likely enforceable, making this option unlikely.

- **I: Right of way easement**  
  This is specific to access rights and does not apply to designating land for a school.

- **J: Zoning regulation**  
  Zoning regulations are government-imposed and do not apply to a private action like this.

The closest term to describe the investor's designation is **easement for public use**, as it involves designating land for a public purpose, even though it does not perfectly align with the idea of transferring ownership. Other options like equitable servitude or restrictive covenant are less precise in this context.
