Question:

Discuss the role of attitudes and expectancy in attention.

Options:

A: Attitudes and expectancy are only relevant in the initial stages of attention.
B: Attitudes and expectancy only affect long-term memory.
C: Attitudes and expectancy alter the intensity of stimuli required to capture attention.
D: Attitudes and expectancy only affect attention during high-stress situations.
E: Attitudes and expectancy affect attention by increasing the speed of cognitive processing for all types of information.
F: Attitudes and expectancy only influence our perception of size and duration.
G: Attitudes and expectancy change the sensory modalities we pay attention to.
H: Attitudes and expectancy guide the focus of attention by making relevant information salient and excluding other information.
I: Attitudes and expectancy primarily determine the accuracy of our visual attention.
J: Attitudes and expectancy have no effect on attention.

Okay, so I have this question about the role of attitudes and expectancy in attention. Hmm, I remember from my psychology class that attention is about how we focus on certain stimuli while ignoring others. But how do attitudes and expectancy play into that?

Wait, attitudes are like our evaluations or feelings towards something, right? So if I have a positive attitude towards, say, a particular brand, maybe I'm more likely to notice ads for that brand. And expectancy is about what we expect to happen. Like, if I expect to see something, I might be more aware of it when it does appear.

So the question is about how these factors influence attention. Let me look at the options. Option A says they're only relevant in the initial stages. I don't think that's right because attention is a continuous process, so these factors probably affect it throughout.

Option B says they only affect long-term memory. No, that doesn't make sense because the question is about attention, not memory storage.

Option C states they alter the intensity of stimuli needed to capture attention. So like, if I expect something, maybe I can notice it even if it's not very intense. That sounds plausible. But I'm not sure if that's the main role.

Option D says they only matter in high-stress situations. I don't recall anything about stress being a condition for this. It seems like a more general influence.

Option E claims they increase the speed of cognitive processing for all information. That might be part of it, but I don't think it's all types of information. Maybe just the relevant ones.

Option F says they affect size and duration perception. That sounds more like illusions or attention-related distortions, not the main role here.

Option G suggests they change sensory modalities. Like, maybe making us focus on visual instead of auditory? I'm not certain, but I think it's more about what we focus on within a modality, not switching between them.

Option H states they guide attention by making relevant info stand out and excluding others. Oh, that makes a lot of sense. Our attitudes and what we expect make certain stimuli more salient, so we pay attention to them while ignoring others.

Option I is about accuracy of visual attention. I don't think that's the main point. It's more about what we choose to focus on, not necessarily the accuracy.

Option J says no effect, which is definitely wrong since the question is about their role.

So putting it together, the correct answer should be H. Because attitudes and expectancy help us focus on what's relevant by making that info stand out, which aligns with selective attention theories.

The correct answer is:

H: Attitudes and expectancy guide the focus of attention by making relevant information salient and excluding other information.

This option accurately reflects how attitudes and expectancy influence attention by highlighting relevant stimuli and filtering out irrelevant ones, aligning with theories of selective attention.

Answer: H
