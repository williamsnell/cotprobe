Okay, so I've got this problem here about xenon gas behaving as a van der Waals gas. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the question gives me the mass of xenon, which is 131 grams. The volume is 1.0 dm³, and the temperature is 25°C. I need to find the pressure it exerts. The options are from 12 atm to 34 atm, so quite a range.

First, I remember that the van der Waals equation is different from the ideal gas law. The ideal gas law is PV = nRT, but van der Waals accounts for the volume of the gas particles and intermolecular forces. The equation is [P + a(n/V)^2](V/n - b) = RT.

Wait, right, but sometimes the equation is written in terms of molar volume. Oh wait, another version is (P + a(n²/V²))(V/n - b) = RT. Or wait, maybe I should think of it in terms of per mole. Oh, right, the van der Waals equation can also be expressed as P = [nRT/(V - nb)] - a (n²/V²), where a and b are the van der Waals constants specific to each gas.

So, I think I need to use this form of the equation. But wait, let me make sure. Yeah, the formula is P = (nRT)/(V - nb) ) - (a (n²) )/(V²). That's the one I should use.

So, I'll need the values of a and b for xenon. I'm not exactly sure what they are, but maybe they're given in a table somewhere. Wait, I think in standard references, the van der Waals constants are listed. Let me try to recall. I think for Xe, a is around 4.3 or something like that, but wait, I should be more precise. Alternatively, perhaps I can look up the exact values, but since I'm just brainstorming, I'll proceed with what I remember.

Wait, maybe I should check the units. Let me think about what units each term uses. P is in atm, V in liters, n in moles, R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K. So, a and b must have units that fit into this. a is in L²·atm/mol², and b is in L/mol.

Wait, I think for Xe, a is 4.3 L²·atm/mol² and b is 0.043 L/mol. Or was it different? Hmm, I might be confusing it with another gas. Alternatively, maybe I should look for the exact values. But for the sake of this problem, I'll proceed with a = 4.3 and b = 0.043.

Alright, moving on. So first, I need to calculate n, the number of moles of Xe.

The molar mass of Xe is about 131 g/mol. Oh wait, because the atomic weight of Xe is around 131, so 131 grams is exactly 1 mole. So n = 131 g / 131 g/mol = 1 mol. That's easy.

Next, the volume is 1.0 dm³. Oh, wait, 1 dm³ is 1 liter. Because 1 L = 1 dm³. So V = 1 L.

Temperature is 25°C, which is 298 K.

Now, putting it all into the van der Waals equation.

So P = [nRT/(V - nb)] - [a (n²)/(V²)].

Plugging in the values:

n = 1, R = 0.0821, T = 298 K, V =1 L.

First, calculate the first term: (nRT)/(V - nb).

nb is 1 * 0.043 L/mol = 0.043 L.

V - nb = 1 L - 0.043 L = 0.957 L.

So, numerator: nRT = 1 * 0.0821 * 298 = let's compute that. 0.0821 * 300 is about 24.63, but since it's 298, subtract 0.0821 * 2 = 0.1642. So 24.63 - 0.1642 = approx 24.4658 atm·L.

Wait, no, wait. Because R is in L·atm/(mol·K), so nRT would have units of L·atm, right? Because n is moles, R is L·atm/(mol·K), T is K. So yeah, the units would be (mol) * (L·atm/mol·K) * K → L·atm. So nRT is 0.0821 * 298 ≈ let me compute it accurately:

0.0821 * 298: 0.08 * 300 is 24, but let me do it properly.

298 * 0.0821 = (300 -2)*0.0821 = 300*0.0821 = 24.63 minus 2*0.0821=0.1642 → 24.63 - 0.1642 = 24.4658 L·atm.

So, nRT = 24.4658 L·atm.

Divide by (V - nb) = 0.957 L → 24.4658 / 0.957 ≈ let's compute that.

0.957 goes into 24.4658 how many times? Let's see:

24.4658 ÷ 0.957 ≈ 25.56 atm.

Wait, because 0.957 * 25 = 23.925, which is less than 24.4658.

So 25 * 0.957 = 23.925 → subtract that from 24.4658 → 24.4658 - 23.925 = 0.5408.

Now, 0.5408 ÷ 0.957 ≈ 0.565. So total is 25.565 atm.

So the first term is approximately 25.565 atm.

Now the second term: a (n²) / V².

a is 4.3 L²·atm/mol². n is 1, so n² is 1.

V is 1 L, so V² is 1 L².

So the second term is (4.3 * 1) / 1 = 4.3 atm.

So P = 25.565 atm - 4.3 atm = 21.265 atm.

Wait a second, but looking at the options, 20 atm is option B, and 22 atm is option A. So 21.265 is close to 21 atm, but none of the options are exactly that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I used the wrong a and b values. Maybe I should confirm the van der Waals constants for Xe.

Wait, I might have remembered the a and b values wrong. Let me think again. I think for Xe, a is 4.3 L²·atm/mol², and b is 0.043 L/mol. Yeah, that's what I thought earlier.

Wait, but perhaps I should look it up. Since I can't, maybe I'm wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is correct, but the answer is not among the options. But that's unlikely.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the first term. Let me redo the calculation.

nRT: 1 * 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K * 298 K = 0.0821 * 298 = let me compute it more accurately.

0.0821 * 298:

Compute 0.08 * 298 = 23.84.

0.0021 *298 = 0.6258.

So total is 23.84 + 0.6258 = 24.4658 L·atm. That's correct.

Divided by (V - nb) = 1 - 0.043 = 0.957 L.

24.4658 / 0.957 = let me compute more accurately.

Let me do 24.4658 ÷ 0.957.

Hmm, 0.957 * 25 = 23.925. 24.4658 - 23.925 = 0.5408.

Now, 0.5408 / 0.957 ≈ 0.565. So 25.565. So first term is 25.565.

Second term is 4.3, so P =25.565 -4.3 = 21.265 atm.

Hmm, the options don't have 21 atm. The closest is 22 atm (A) and 20 atm (B). So maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the van der Waals equation is written differently. Another arrangement is [P + a(n/V)^2] (V/n - b) = RT.

Wait, that would be different. Oh wait, let me clarify the equation. The van der Waals equation is:

[P + (a (n²))/(V²)] [ (V)/n - b ] = RT.

Wait no, actually, the equation is:

[P + a (n/V)^2 ] [ V/n - b ] = RT.

Alternatively, when expressed in terms of n, V, R, T, a, and b.

Wait, no, perhaps I should write it correctly. The van der Waals equation is:

(P + (a n²)/(V²)) (V - n b) = n R T.

Wait, maybe I confused the terms earlier. Let me rederive it.

Wait, the van der Waals equation is:

[P + (n² a)/(V²)] (V - n b) = n R T.

Yes, that's correct. So, P = [n R T/(V - n b)] - [a n² / V²].

Which is what I did earlier. So perhaps I didn't make an error in the equation.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (V - nb). Because V is 1 L, and nb is 1 * 0.043 L, so 0.957 L. Correct.

Wait, then perhaps the a and b values I used are incorrect. Let me think again. Maybe a is 4.3, but perhaps the correct a is higher.

Wait, I think I might have mixed up a and b. Let me try to recall: I think for Xe, a is about 4.3 and b is about 0.043, but maybe the actual a is higher. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for more precise values.

Alternatively, perhaps the a is 4.3 and b is 0.043, but maybe I should check a table. Since I can't, I'll proceed, but perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe there's another approach. Let me compute the pressure if it were ideal, then see how much the van der Waals adjustment changes it.

Ideal gas law: PV = nRT → P = nRT/V.

n=1, R=0.0821, T=298, V=1.

So P = (1)(0.0821)(298) / 1 = 24.4658 atm.

So ideal pressure is about 24.47 atm. But with the van der Waals correction, we subtracted 4.3 atm, giving 20.17 atm.

Wait, wait, no. Because the van der Waals equation gives a higher pressure due to the volume correction and lower due to the a term.

Wait, in the equation, the first term is higher because the volume is less (V - nb) is less than V, so nRT/(V-nb) would be higher than nRT/V. Then, the second term, a (n²/V²), is subtracted.

So in the ideal case, it's 24.47 atm.

In van der Waals, [nRT/(V - nb)] would be higher. Let me see: 24.47 atm ideal, but when considering V-nb=0.957, the first term is 24.4658 / 0.957 ≈25.56 atm. Then, subtracting a term of 4.3 atm, giving 21.26 atm.

Hmm, but the options don't have 21 atm. So perhaps I made a mistake in the a value.

Wait, perhaps a is higher. Let me think, I might have a confused a for another gas. Maybe a is higher, like 4.3 or perhaps 6.5? Wait, I'm not sure. Let me search my memory: I think for Xe, a is around 4.3 L²·atm/mol².

Alternatively, perhaps I should use more precise numbers. Let me see, perhaps I can find a table online, but since I can't, I'll proceed with what I have.

Wait, perhaps the a value is actually 4.35 or something else, but that's not going to change the calculation much. Alternatively, maybe I should compute using more precise numbers.

Wait, let me recompute a(n²)/V².

a=4.3, n=1, V=1.

So a(n²)/V² = 4.3 * (1)^2 / (1)^2 =4.3 atm.

So P = 25.565 -4.3 =21.265 atm.

Hmm.

Looking back at the options, the closest is option A:22 atm and option B:20 atm.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in nRT/(V - nb). Let me compute that again more accurately.

nRT = 1 * 0.0821 * 298 = let's compute 0.0821 * 298.

0.0821 * 300 is 24.63. But since it's 298, which is 300 -2, so we subtract 0.0821*2=0.1642. So 24.63 - 0.1642=24.4658 L·atm.

V - nb = 1 - (1)(0.043) = 0.957 L.

So nRT/(V - nb) =24.4658 /0.957.

Let me compute 24.4658 ÷ 0.957:

Compute 0.957 *25=23.925 → as before.

24.4658 -23.925 =0.5408.

Now, 0.5408 divided by 0.957.

Let me compute 0.957 × 0.565= let's see:

0.957 * 0.5 =0.4785.

0.957 *0.06 = 0.05742.

0.957 *0.005=0.004785.

So 0.5 +0.06+0.005=0.565.

Sum: 0.4785 +0.05742=0.53592 +0.004785=0.540705.

So 0.957 * 0.565 = 0.540705.

Which matches the 0.5408, so 0.5408 ÷0.957=0.565.

So 25.565 atm.

Thus, first term is 25.565 atm, second term is 4.3 atm, so P=21.265 atm.

Hmm, but none of the options is 21. So perhaps I made a mistake in the van der Waals constants.

Wait, perhaps I should check the a and b values again. Maybe I used the wrong ones. Let me try to recall.

Wait, another possible source of error: perhaps the units for a and b are different. Let me confirm.

The van der Waals constants a and b have specific units. For a, it's L²·atm/mol², and for b, it's L/mol.

So for Xe, I think a is 4.3 L²·atm/mol², and b is 0.043 L/mol. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should use more precise values. Let me think again.

Wait, I found online once that Xe has a=4.35 L²·atm/mol² and b=0.0437 L/mol. Let's use a=4.35 and b=0.0437.

So let's recalculate with a=4.35.

So, first term: nRT/(V - nb) = 24.4658 / (1 -1 *0.0437) → 1 -0.0437=0.9563 L.

24.4658 ÷0.9563 = let's compute.

0.9563 *25=23.9075. 24.4658-23.9075=0.5583.

0.5583 ÷0.9563 ≈0.583.

So total is 25.583 atm.

Second term: a (n²)/V²=4.35 *1 /1 =4.35 atm.

So P=25.583 -4.35=21.233 atm.

Still around 21.23 atm. So same as before.

Hmm, the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, another possibility: maybe the volume is in dm³, which is liters, but perhaps I should have converted it to m³ or something else. No, 1 dm³ is 1 L.

Wait, perhaps I should have used R in different units. Because R can be 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K or 8.314 J/mol·K, but in this case, since the pressure is in atm, using 0.0821 is correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps I should use the molar volume version of the equation. No, I think the equation I used is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the vessel volume is 1.0 dm³, which is 1 L, but perhaps it's in terms of per mole volume, but no, the equation uses V in liters, n in moles.

Wait, perhaps I should check the calculation again.

Wait, let me compute 0.0821 *298 more accurately.

0.0821 *298:

298 = 200 + 90 +8.

0.0821*200=16.42.

0.0821*90=7.389.

0.0821*8=0.6568.

Sum:16.42 +7.389=23.809 +0.6568=24.4658. Correct.

So nRT =24.4658 L·atm.

V -nb=0.957 L.

24.4658/0.957=25.565 atm.

a term:4.3 atm.

So P=21.265 atm.

Hmm. Since this value isn't in the options, perhaps the problem expects an approximation, or maybe I made a miscalculation.

Wait, perhaps the problem gives the
