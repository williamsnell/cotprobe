The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A doctor is charged with the murder of his wife. The prosecution alleges that he murdered his wife by giving her a massive injection of succinylcholine while she was asleep. Succinylcholine is a drug used in small quantities by anesthesiologists as a muscle relaxant. The prosecution claims that the fatal dose given to the wife so totally relaxed her lung muscles that she suffocated. During the trial, a toxicologist, who had no previous knowledge of the case, sat in court and heard all of the evidence about the wife's death and autopsy. As part of the doctor's defense, his attorney calls the toxicologist to give his opinion on the cause of the wife's death. May the toxicologist so testify?

Options:

A: No, because he did not directly examine the wife's body.
B: No, because the cause of death is an issue to be decided by the jury.
C: Yes, because an expert may base his opinion on facts made known to him at the trial.
D: Yes, because he has relevant experience in the field of toxicology.
E: No, because he has no personal knowledge of the wife's death.
F: Yes, because he can provide an unbiased perspective.
G: No, because he did not conduct the autopsy himself.
H: No, because his testimony might bias the jury.
I: Yes, because he can identify the data upon which his opinion is based.
J: Yes, because his professional expertise allows him to form a valid opinion.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about whether a toxicologist can testify in a murder case. Let me break it down step by step.

The scenario is a doctor is accused of murdering his wife using succinylcholine. The prosecution says he gave her a fatal dose, causing her muscles to relax so much she suffocated. The defense calls a toxicologist who heard all the evidence in court but didn't know about the case before. The question is whether this toxicologist can give his opinion on the cause of death.

Hmm, I remember that expert witnesses can testify based on their expertise. But there are rules about what they can base their opinions on. I think experts can rely on information provided during the trial, even if they didn't personally examine the person or conduct tests themselves.

Wait, in court, experts can give opinions based on facts presented in court. So if the toxicologist heard all the evidence, including the autopsy results and other relevant info, he can form an opinion based on that. His opinion would be based on the evidence presented, not on his own personal examination.

So looking at the options:

Option A says no because he didn't examine the body. But I think experts can testify without direct examination as long as they base it on the evidence presented. So A might not be correct.

Option B says no because the cause is for the jury. But expert opinions are allowed to help the jury understand complex issues; the jury still decides. So B is probably wrong.

Option C says yes because an expert can base opinion on trial facts. That sounds right based on what I was thinking.

Option D says yes because of relevant experience. While that's true, the question is about the basis of his testimony, not just his qualifications. So D is correct in part but maybe not the best answer.

Option E says no because no personal knowledge. But expert opinions can be based on hearsay or evidence presented, not requiring personal knowledge. So E is incorrect.

Option F says yes because unbiased. That's not the main issue here; the admissibility is about the basis of the opinion, not bias.

Option G says no because he didn't do the autopsy. Again, he can rely on the evidence presented, which includes the autopsy report, so G is wrong.

Option H says no because testimony might bias. Experts are allowed to testify, even if their opinions are influential. The jury considers the credibility.

Option I says yes because he can identify data. That's true, but the main point is that he can base his opinion on the trial evidence.

Option J says yes because of expertise. This is similar to D, focusing on his qualifications. It's correct but maybe C is more precise.

I think the correct answer is C because it directly addresses that an expert can base their opinion on the facts made known at trial, which includes all the evidence presented.

The toxicologist may testify because an expert may base their opinion on facts presented during the trial, even without personal examination. 

Answer: C
