Question:

An eager AP Biology student interested in studying osmosis and the movement of water in solutions took a dialysis bag containing a 0.5 M solution and placed it into a beaker containing a 0.6 M solution. Which of the following is true about water potential?

Options:

A: An eager AP Biology student interested in studying osmosis and the movement of water in solutions took a dialysis bag containing a 0.5 M solution and placed it into a beaker containing a 0.6 M solution. It drives the movement of water from a region of lower water potential to a region of higher water potential.
B: Solute potential is the only factor that determines the water potential.
C: Pressure potential combines with solute potential to determine the water potential.
D: Water potential always drives water from an area of lower pressure potential to an area of higher pressure potential.

Okay, so I've got this AP Biology question about osmosis and water potential. Hmm, I remember that water potential is a measure of the potential energy of water in a system. It helps determine the direction in which water will flow via osmosis. 

The question says there's a dialysis bag with a 0.5 M solution placed into a beaker with a 0.6 M solution. I'm trying to recall what water potential depends on. Oh right, water potential (Ψ) is the sum of two main components: solute potential (Ψs) and pressure potential (Ψp). So Ψ = Ψs + Ψp.

Wait, so in this scenario, the dialysis bag is semipermeable, allowing water to pass but not solutes. The solution inside the bag is less concentrated (0.5 M) compared to the beaker (0.6 M). So the beaker has a higher solute concentration. 

Which means the beaker solution has a lower water potential because higher solute concentration lowers the water potential. Or wait, no, maybe I have this backwards. Solute potential is negative because solutes lower water potential. So higher solute concentration leads to lower (more negative) water potential. 

So the dialysis bag is in a solution where the surrounding has a lower water potential than the inside? Wait, no. If the beaker solution is more concentrated (higher solute), its Ψs is more negative. So the beaker has lower water potential than the bag. Because water moves from higher to lower water potential. So water would move out of the bag into the beaker. 

But the question is about which statement is correct regarding water potential.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Water moves from lower water potential to higher. Wait, no, the opposite. Water moves from high to low water potential. Because if the outside solution has lower water potential, then the inside of the bag (higher Ψ) would lose water to the outside. So A is incorrect because it claims movement is from lower to higher.

Option B: Solute potential is the only factor. No, pressure potential also matters. Like in a plant cell, when it's under pressure, the pressure potential is higher, which affects overall water potential. So B is wrong.

Option C: Pressure potential combines with solute potential. Yes, that's exactly what I was thinking earlier. Water potential is the sum of these two. So C is correct.

Option D: Water always moves from lower pressure potential to higher. Wait, no. Pressure potential is part of the equation. But overall, water moves based on water potential, which combines both solute and pressure. So D is incorrect because it's not considering the other factors.

So the correct answer should be option C.
</think>

Water potential (Ψ) is determined by the combination of solute potential (Ψs) and pressure potential (Ψp), where Ψ = Ψs + Ψp. In this scenario, the dialysis bag contains a 0.5 M solution, and the beaker contains a 0.6 M solution. Since the beaker has a higher solute concentration, its solute potential is more negative, resulting in a lower water potential compared to the dialysis bag. Water moves from regions of higher water potential to regions of lower water potential, so water would flow out of the dialysis bag and into the beaker.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** is incorrect because water moves from regions of higher water potential to lower water potential, not the reverse.
- **Option B** is incorrect because solute potential is not the only factor; pressure potential also plays a role.
- **Option C** is correct because water potential is indeed the sum of solute potential and pressure potential.
- **Option D** is incorrect because water movement is driven by water potential as a whole, not solely by pressure potential.

The correct answer is **C**.
