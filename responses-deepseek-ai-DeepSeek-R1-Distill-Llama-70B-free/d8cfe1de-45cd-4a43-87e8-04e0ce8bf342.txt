Question:

A previously healthy 19-year-old college student comes to student health services 24 hours after the onset of headache, stiff neck, and sensitivity to light. She does not recall any sick contacts. She had chickenpox at the age of 7 years. Her most recent examination 1 year ago included PPD skin testing and showed no abnormalities. She takes a daily multivitamin and an herbal weight-loss preparation. She received all appropriate immunizations during childhood but has not received any since then. She does not smoke, drink alcohol, or use illicit drugs. There is no family history of serious illness. She appears lethargic. Her temperature is 39.1°C (102.4°F), pulse is 112/min, respirations are 20/min, and blood pressure is 100/68 mm Hg. Examination shows diffuse petechiae. Kernig and Brudzinski signs are present. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. A lumbar puncture is performed. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis shows numerous segmented neutrophils and a decreased glucose concentration. A Gram stain of the CSF shows gram-negative cocci. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?

Options:

A: Ceftriaxone
B: Clindamycin
C: Erythromycin
D: Metronidazole

Okay, so I have this question about a patient presenting with certain symptoms, and I need to figure out the best pharmacotherapy for her. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let's read the scenario carefully. The patient is a 19-year-old college student who comes in with a headache, stiff neck, and sensitivity to light. These symptoms started 24 hours ago. She doesn't remember any sick contacts, but she had chickenpox at age 7. Her last exam was a year ago, which included a PPD test—so probably tested for TB, which was negative. She's taking a multivitamin and an herbal weight-loss supplement. She got all her childhood immunizations but none since then. No smoking, alcohol, or drugs. Family history is unremarkable. 

On exam, she looks lethargic. Her vital signs are temp 39.1°C (which is about 102.4°F), pulse 112, respirations 20, BP 100/68. She has diffuse petechiae. Kernig and Brudzinski signs are present—those are signs of meningismus, indicating meningitis. The rest of her exam is normal. 

They did a lumbar puncture, and the CSF analysis shows numerous segmented neutrophils and decreased glucose. The Gram stain shows gram-negative cocci.

So, putting this together, the patient has bacterial meningitis. The presence of neutrophils suggests a bacterial cause because viral meningitis usually has lymphocytic predominance. Decreased CSF glucose also points towards bacterial meningitis since bacteria tend to cause lower glucose levels as they consume it.

Gram-negative cocci... Hmm, what are the common gram-negative cocci? The main ones are Neisseria species. Neisseria meningitidis (meningococcus) is a common cause of bacterial meningitis, especially in young adults. Another possibility could be Neisseria gonorrhoeae, but that's less common for meningitis and more associated with sepsis or other infections.

Looking at the patient's vaccination history: she had all her childhood immunizations but none since then. So, she probably didn't receive the meningococcal vaccine, which is typically given around 11-12 years old, with a booster in late teens. Without that, she's at risk for meningococcal meningitis.

Meningococcal meningitis is known for causing petechiae or a rash that doesn't blanch, which fits with her diffuse petechiae. So that supports the diagnosis of meningococcal meningitis.

Now, for treatment. The standard treatment for bacterial meningitis, especially when caused by Neisseria meningitidis, is a third-generation cephalosporin. Ceftriaxone is a common choice because it's effective against meningococcus and has good penetration into the CSF. Penicillin or ampicillin might be used in some cases, but with resistance concerns, cephalosporins are preferred.

Looking at the options, option A is Ceftriaxone. Option B is Clindamycin, which is more for anaerobic infections, not typically first-line for meningococcal. Option C, Erythromycin, is a macrolide and not used for meningitis. Option D is Metronidazole, which is for anaerobes or protozoa, like in amoebic meningitis, which is very rare.

So the most appropriate choice is Ceftriaxone, which is option A.
</think>

The patient is a 19-year-old college student presenting with symptoms of bacterial meningitis, including headache, stiff neck, photophobia, lethargy, fever, and petechiae. Physical examination reveals Kernig and Brudzinski signs, confirming meningitis. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis shows numerous segmented neutrophils, decreased glucose, and gram-negative cocci on Gram stain, which is consistent with Neisseria meningitidis infection. The patient’s vaccination history indicates she likely did not receive the meningococcal vaccine, putting her at risk for meningococcal meningitis.

The treatment of choice for bacterial meningitis caused by Neisseria meningitidis is a third-generation cephalosporin, such as ceftriaxone, due to its efficacy and penetration into the CSF. Other options like clindamycin, erythromycin, or metronidazole are not appropriate for this infection. Therefore, the most appropriate pharmacotherapy is ceftriaxone.

Answer: A
