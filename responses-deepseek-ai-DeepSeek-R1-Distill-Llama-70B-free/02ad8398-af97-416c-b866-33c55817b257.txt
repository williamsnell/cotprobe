Question:

A construction contractor brought a breach of contract claim in federal court against a homeowner who had hired the contractor to build an apartment over an existing garage. The action turned on the scope of the work covered by the contract. The contractor and the homeowner were the only witnesses at the bench trial, and they strongly disagreed about the scope of the work. At the end of the trial, the judge stated findings of fact on the record but never issued a written opinion. Neither party objected to the findings. The judge found in favor of the homeowner, and the contractor appealed. Is the appellate court likely to overturn the findings?

Options:

A: No, because the appellate court must give due regard to the trial judge's opportunity to determine witness credibility.
B: Yes, because the contractor and homeowner had different views on the scope of the work.
C: Yes, because a judge must set forth findings of fact in a written opinion or memorandum of decision.
D: No, because the judge's findings of fact were stated on the record.
E: Yes, because the homeowner was found in favor.
F: No, because the contractor brought the claim in federal court.
G: Yes, because there were disputed issues of fact at trial.
H: No, because the contractor didn't provide sufficient evidence to support the claim.
I: Yes, because the appellate court has the power to overturn the findings.
J: No, because the contractor failed to object to the findings when the judge stated them in open court.

Alright, so I have this question about a breach of contract case in federal court. Let me try to break it down step by step. Okay, the contractor sued the homeowner, and the case hinged on the scope of the work covered by their contract. Both parties testified at the bench trial, and they disagreed strongly about what the contract included. 

At the end of the trial, the judge made findings of fact orally but didn't issue a written opinion. Neither party objected to these findings. The judge ruled in favor of the homeowner, and the contractor appealed. The question is whether the appellate court is likely to overturn the findings.

Hmm, I remember that in bench trials, the judge acts as the fact-finder. So, the standard of review for findings of fact is important here. I think that under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a)(6), when a court makes oral findings, they're sufficient as long as they're clear enough to allow for review. The key point is that the findings must be explicit enough to show the court's basis for its decision.

Also, the standard of review for findings of fact is whether they are clearly erroneous. The appellate court will give a lot of deference to the trial judge's findings, especially regarding witness credibility, because the judge saw the witnesses testify live. So, the contractor would have a high burden to show that the judge's findings were clearly erroneous.

Looking at the options:

Option A says no because the appellate court gives due regard to the trial judge's assessment of credibility. That makes sense because the trial judge's evaluation of witnesses is given a lot of weight.

Option B says yes because the parties disagreed. But disagreement doesn't necessarily mean the judge was wrong; the judge has to make a decision based on credibility.

Option C says yes because findings must be in writing. I think that's not correct because Rule 52 allows oral findings as long as they're recorded.

Option D says no because the findings were on the record. That's true, but the key is whether they were sufficient, not just that they were oral.

Option E is about who won, which doesn't affect the standard of review.

Option F talks about federal court, but the venue doesn't change the standard here.

Option G mentions disputed facts, but the appellate court doesn't reweigh evidence; it only checks for clear error.

Option H says the contractor didn't provide enough evidence, but that's a question of the sufficiency of the evidence, not the standard on appeal.

Option I says the appellate court can overturn, but that's too broad; they can only overturn if there's clear error.

Option J says no because the contractor didn't object. Wait, but when the findings are oral, do you need to object? I think that under Rule 52(b), a party may request amended findings, but if they don't object, it might limit their ability to challenge on appeal. But the question states neither objected, so maybe that affects the ability to challenge the findings.

Wait, but the main issue is the standard of review. The judge's oral findings are enough, and without clear error, the appellate court won't overturn. So the likely answer is A or D.

Another thought: if the findings were stated on the record, that's sufficient. So D says no because the judge's findings were on the record, which is correct because Rule 52 doesn't require written findings.

Wait, no, the question is about overturning. So even if findings are oral, the appellate court will review them under the clearly erroneous standard. So the fact that they were oral doesn't make them more or less likely to be overturned, but the key is whether they're clearly wrong.

So the best reason the appellate court won't overturn is because they give deference to the trial judge's credibility assessments. So option A is the correct answer.

Wait, but what about option D? It says no because the findings were stated on the record. That's a correct fact, but the reason is more about the sufficiency of the findings. However, the question is about the likelihood of overturning, which is more about the standard of review. So A is better because it addresses the standard (deference to credibility) rather than the form of the findings.

So the answer should be A.

The appellate court is unlikely to overturn the findings because it must give significant deference to the trial judge's opportunity to assess witness credibility during the bench trial. Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a)(6), findings of fact made orally on the record are sufficient if they are clear enough to permit meaningful review. The standard of review for findings of fact is whether they are "clearly erroneous." Since the trial judge directly observed the witnesses and their testimony, the appellate court will defer to the judge's credibility determinations unless there is a showing of clear error. The fact that the findings were oral does not undermine their validity, as long as they are adequately stated on the record. Therefore, the appellate court is most likely to uphold the findings based on the trial judge's assessment of witness credibility.
