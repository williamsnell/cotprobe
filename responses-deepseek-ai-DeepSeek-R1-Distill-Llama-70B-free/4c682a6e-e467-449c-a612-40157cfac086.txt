Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about the weights of books on a shelf and figure out which inequality represents the weight of any chosen book. Let me read the question again carefully.

The shelf has four books with weights 2.5, 3.2, 2.7, and 2.3 pounds. The question is asking which inequality represents the weight w of any book chosen from the shelf. The options are A through J, each with different inequalities.

Hmm, so I need to find an inequality that applies to all possible books on the shelf. That means whatever inequality I choose must be true for each of the four weights given.

Let me think about this. Since the question is about any book, the inequality should be such that all the given weights satisfy it. So I need to look at each option and check if all the book weights meet that condition.

Looking at the weights: 2.3, 2.5, 2.7, and 3.2. So the smallest weight is 2.3 and the largest is 3.2.

I should probably consider what each inequality is saying. Let's go through the options one by one.

Option A: w > 3.2. Well, the biggest book is exactly 3.2, so this would mean w has to be more than 3.2. But since one book is 3.2, this inequality isn't true for that book. So A is out.

Option B: w > 2.9. Let's see, 2.3 is less than 2.9, so for the 2.3-pound book, this would be false. So B can't be the right answer because not all books satisfy it.

Option C: w > 2.3. Well, all the books are heavier than 2.3 except the 2.3-pound one. Wait, 2.3 is equal to 2.3, so the inequality w > 2.3 would exclude the 2.3-pound book. So this isn't correct either because the 2.3-pound book wouldn't satisfy it. So C isn't the answer.

Option D: w > 2.5. Let's check each weight. 2.3 is less than 2.5, so the 2.3-pound book doesn't satisfy this. So D is incorrect.

Option E: w < 3.2. Let's see. All the books are less than 3.2 except the one that's exactly 3.2. Wait, 3.2 is not less than 3.2, it's equal. So for the 3.2-pound book, this inequality would be false. So E isn't the correct answer.

Option F: w < 2.4. The 2.3-pound book is less than 2.4, but the others like 2.5, 2.7, and 3.2 are all higher. So this inequality isn't satisfied by all the books. So F is out.

Option G: w < 2.7. Let's check. 2.3 is less than 2.7. 2.5 is also less. But 2.7 is equal, so that's not less than. And 3.2 is way higher. So G isn't correct because 2.7 and 3.2 don't satisfy it.

Option H: w > 3.0. The 2.3, 2.5, 2.7 books are all less than or equal to 3.0. So this inequality doesn't hold for them. So H is out.

Option I: w < 3.3. Let's check each weight. 2.3 <3.3 yes. 2.5 yes. 2.7 yes. 3.2 is less than 3.3. So all books satisfy this. So I is a possibility.

Option J: w <3.1. Let's see. 3.2 is greater than 3.1, so the 3.2-pound book doesn't satisfy this. So J is not correct.

So the only option that works for all books is option I: w <3.3.

Wait, but wait a second. The question is asking for an inequality that represents the weight w of any book chosen. So w could be any of the four values, but the inequality must hold true for all possible w's.

So looking back, the maximum weight is 3.2. So any inequality that says w is less than a number larger than 3.2 would include all the books. But let's check the options again.

Option I says w <3.3, which is true for all four books because 3.2 is less than 3.3.

Option E was w <3.2, but since one book is exactly 3.2, that doesn't satisfy because it's not less than.

So I think the correct answer is I.

To determine which inequality represents the weight \( w \) of any book chosen from the shelf, we analyze the given weights: 2.3, 2.5, 2.7, and 3.2 pounds. The goal is to find an inequality that is true for all four weights.

- **Option A: \( w > 3.2 \)**  
  This is false because one book weighs exactly 3.2 pounds, and the inequality does not hold for it.

- **Option B: \( w > 2.9 \)**  
  This is false because the book weighing 2.3 pounds does not satisfy this inequality.

- **Option C: \( w > 2.3 \)**  
  This is false because the book weighing 2.3 pounds does not satisfy this inequality, as it is not greater than 2.3.

- **Option D: \( w > 2.5 \)**  
  This is false because the book weighing 2.3 pounds does not satisfy this inequality.

- **Option E: \( w < 3.2 \)**  
  This is false because the book weighing 3.2 pounds does not satisfy this inequality, as it is not less than 3.2.

- **Option F: \( w < 2.4 \)**  
  This is false because the books weighing 2.5, 2.7, and 3.2 pounds do not satisfy this inequality.

- **Option G: \( w < 2.7 \)**  
  This is false because the book weighing 2.7 pounds does not satisfy this inequality, as it is not less than 2.7.

- **Option H: \( w > 3.0 \)**  
  This is false because the books weighing 2.3, 2.5, and 2.7 pounds do not satisfy this inequality.

- **Option I: \( w < 3.3 \)**  
  This is true because all four books (2.3, 2.5, 2.7, and 3.2 pounds) satisfy this inequality, as they are all less than 3.3.

- **Option J: \( w < 3.1 \)**  
  This is false because the book weighing 3.2 pounds does not satisfy this inequality.

The only inequality that holds true for all four book weights is **Option I: \( w < 3.3 \)**.
