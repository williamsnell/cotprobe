Okay, so I've got this problem about osmotic pressure, and I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step. The question gives me the molecular weight of sucrose, which is 342 g/mol. The solution is 1 gram of sucrose in 100 cm³ of solvent, and the temperature is 0°C. They also mention the measured osmotic pressure is 0.649 atm, but I need to calculate the expected using the simple equation.

Wait, right, the osmotic pressure equation. I remember it's one of those colligative property formulas. Oh yes, the formula is π = iMRT, where π is osmotic pressure, i is the van't Hoff factor, M is molarity, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature in Kelvin.

Wait, but I think the question says to use the simple form. Oh wait, maybe it's π = cRT, where c is the concentration in mol/m³? Or is it something else?

Hmm, let me think. The basic formula for osmotic pressure when the solution is dilute is often approximated as π = iCRT, where C is the concentration in mol/L, R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K, T is temperature in Kelvin. Oh wait, but wait, sometimes the formula is written as π = (n/V) RT, where n is moles and V is volume in liters. Yeah, that makes sense.

So first, I need to find the concentration in terms of moles per liter. Because the volume here is 100 cm³, which is 0.1 liters. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 100 cm³ is 0.1 liters. So the volume is 0.1 L.

The mass of sucrose is 1 gram. The molecular weight is 342 g/mol, so the number of moles is mass divided by molecular weight. So n = 1 g / 342 g/mol = approximately 0.002924 mol.

Then, the concentration is n/V. So 0.002924 mol / 0.1 L = 0.02924 mol/L. Wait, let me compute that. 1/342 is approximately 0.002924, and divided by 0.1 is 0.02924. So 0.02924 M.

Wait, but wait, the van't Hoff factor i for sucrose. Sucrose is a nonelectrolyte, right? So when it dissolves, it doesn't dissociate into ions. So i is 1. So that part is easy, i=1.

Now, R is the gas constant. Let me make sure I have the right value. R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K.

Temperature is given as 0°C. Oh, wait, 0°C is 273.15 K.

So plugging into the formula: π = i * c * R * T.

So π = 1 * 0.02924 mol/L * 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K * 273.15 K.

Let me compute that step by step.

First, 0.02924 * 0.0821 = let's see. 0.02924 * 0.08 is approximately 0.002339. But more accurately, 0.0821 * 0.02924.

Let me compute 0.02924 * 0.0821.

0.02 * 0.0821 = 0.001642. 0.00924 * 0.0821: 0.009 * 0.0821 is 0.0007389, and 0.00024 * 0.0821 is about 0.0000197. So total is approximately 0.001642 + 0.0007389 + 0.0000197 ≈ 0.0024006.

Wait, maybe it's easier to just multiply 0.02924 * 0.0821.

0.02924 * 0.0821:

Let me compute 2924e-6 * 821e-4.

Wait, perhaps better to do it with numbers. 0.02924 is 2.924e-2, and 0.0821 is 8.21e-2. Multiply them: (2.924 * 8.21) * 1e-4.

2.924 * 8 is about 23.392, and 2.924 * 0.21 is about 0.614. So total approx 24.006 * 1e-4 is 0.0024006 atm·L/(mol·K) * mol/L → atm·L/(K·L) → atm/K.

Wait, no, perhaps I should think in terms of units. But perhaps better to just compute the numbers.

So 0.02924 * 0.0821 = let's calculate it precisely.

0.02924 × 0.0821:

Multiply 0.02924 by 0.08: 0.0023392.

Multiply 0.02924 by 0.0021: 0.000061404.

Add the two: 0.0023392 + 0.000061404 = 0.002400604.

So approximately 0.0024006 atm·L/(mol·K) * mol/L → atm/K.

Now multiply by temperature T, which is 273.15 K.

So 0.0024006 * 273.15 ≈ Let's compute that.

0.0024 * 273 = approx 0.6552.

Wait, 0.0024 * 273.15: 0.0024 * 200 is 0.48, 0.0024 *73.15 is about 0.17556. So total 0.65556 atm.

Wait, but I approximated 0.0024006 as 0.0024. So the calculation is about 0.655 atm. But wait, wait, because 0.0024006 is about 0.0024006, so 0.0024006 * 273.15 = ?

Let me compute more accurately:

0.0024006 * 273.15 = ?

Compute 0.0024 * 273.15 = 0.65556.

But wait, the exact value with 0.0024006 is very close to 0.0024006 * 273.15.

Let me compute 0.0024006 * 273.15:

Multiply 0.0024006 by 200: 0.48012.

Multiply 0.0024006 by 73.15: 0.0024006 *70 = 0.168042, 0.0024006 *3.15=0.007563. So total 0.168042 + 0.007563 = 0.175605. So total of 0.48012 + 0.175605 = 0.655725 atm.

So approximately 0.6557 atm.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 0.655 atm, and option G is 0.600, option I is 0.700.

Wait, but wait, am I missing something? Oh wait, the volume given is 100 cm³ of solvent, but in osmotic pressure calculations, is the volume the solution volume or solvent volume? Hmm. Wait, in the formula, V is the volume of the solution, but when the solution is dilute, the volume of the solution is approximately equal to the volume of the solvent. So perhaps using 0.1 L is correct.

Wait, but let me double-check the formula. The osmotic pressure formula is π = (n/V) RT, where V is in liters. If the solution is dilute, V (solution) ≈ V (solvent). So 100 cm³ is 0.1 L, so V = 0.1 L. So n/V is 0.002924 / 0.1 = 0.02924 M. That seems correct.

Wait, but another way to think: when the solution is very dilute, the volume of the solute is negligible, so the total volume is approximately the solvent volume. So yes, the calculation is correct.

So the expected osmotic pressure is approximately 0.6557 atm, which matches option B: 0.655 atm.

But wait, the given measured osmotic pressure is 0.649 atm. But the question is asking to calculate the expected, using the simple equation. So the expected is about 0.655 atm, so the correct answer is B.
</think>

To calculate the expected osmotic pressure of the sucrose solution, we use the formula for osmotic pressure:

\[
\pi = i \cdot c \cdot R \cdot T
\]

Where:
- \( i \) is the van't Hoff factor (1 for sucrose, as it does not dissociate in solution),
- \( c \) is the molarity of the solution (in mol/L),
- \( R \) is the gas constant (\( 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \)),
- \( T \) is the temperature in Kelvin.

### Step 1: Calculate the molarity (\( c \)) of the solution
The mass of sucrose is \( 1 \, \text{g} \), and its molecular weight is \( 342 \, \text{g/mol} \). The number of moles of sucrose is:

\[
n = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{molecular weight}} = \frac{1}{342} \approx 0.002924 \, \text{mol}
\]

The volume of the solvent is \( 100 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.1 \, \text{L} \). The molarity is:

\[
c = \frac{n}{V} = \frac{0.002924}{0.1} \approx 0.02924 \, \text{mol/L}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the osmotic pressure (\( \pi \))
Substitute the values into the formula:

\[
\pi = i \cdot c \cdot R \cdot T
\]

Given:
- \( i = 1 \),
- \( c = 0.02924 \, \text{mol/L} \),
- \( R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \),
- \( T = 0^\circ \text{C} = 273.15 \, \text{K} \),

\[
\pi = 1 \cdot 0.02924 \cdot 0.0821 \cdot 273.15
\]

First, calculate \( c \cdot R \):

\[
0.02924 \cdot 0.0821 \approx 0.0024006 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)}
\]

Now multiply by \( T \):

\[
0.0024006 \cdot 273.15 \approx 0.6557 \, \text{atm}
\]

### Final Answer
The expected osmotic pressure is approximately \( 0.655 \, \text{atm} \), which matches option **B**.
