Options:

A: In older age groups men outnumber women.
B: The rate of increase in the median age of populations is slower in developing countries than wealthy countries.

Okay, so I need to answer this multiple-choice question about the global aging population. Let me think through each option carefully.

The question asks which statement is correct regarding the global aging population. I know that the global population is aging, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, so I'll go through each option one by one.

Option A: In older age groups men outnumber women. Hmm, I think I remember that women generally live longer than men, so in older age groups, there are usually more women. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B: The rate of increase in the median age is slower in developing countries than in wealthy countries. Wait, I thought that developing countries are actually experiencing faster changes. Because as they develop, their life expectancies increase and birth rates might drop, leading to an aging population. So maybe B is wrong because their median age is increasing faster, not slower.

Option C: The global aging population is decreasing due to better healthcare. No, that doesn't make sense. Better healthcare should lead to longer lives, so the aging population would increase, not decrease. So C is incorrect.

Option D: By 2050, the majority under 40. I think by 2050, the proportion of older people will have increased a lot, so maybe the majority would still be under 40, but I'm not sure. I'll have to think about this more.

Option E: Men have a lower mortality rate than women over their lives. No, I believe women have lower mortality rates on average, especially as they get older. So E is incorrect.

Option F: The rate of increase in median age is greater in developing countries. This goes back to what I thought earlier. Developing countries are catching up quickly, so their median age is increasing faster. So F might be correct.

Option G: In older age groups, the number of men and women is equal. No, as I thought earlier, women outnumber men in older groups. So G is wrong.

So now, let's go back to each option.

A: Incorrect, women > men in older groups.

B: Says developing countries have slower increase. I think that's wrong because they're likely increasing faster.

C: Incorrect, healthcare would increase aging population, not decrease.

D: By 2050, the majority under 40. I'm not so sure. The global population is aging, but I think that in many regions, especially more developed ones, the median age is rising. But the global majority might still be younger because of high birth rates in some developing countries. Alternatively, perhaps the majority under 40 will still exist, but the proportion over 65 is growing. So D could be correct.

Wait, the question is about which statement is correct. Let me check each.

Option F: Developing countries have a greater rate of increase in median age. Because as developing countries improve healthcare and living standards, their populations age faster. So yes, F is correct.

But wait, what about D? If the majority of the world's population is under 40, that's likely still true because developing countries have large young populations. But the question is about the trend of aging. Wait, the global population is still expected to have a higher proportion of older people, but the majority might still be under a certain age.

Wait, the median age is increasing. For example, the global median age was around 30 in 2019 and is projected to be around 38 by 2050. So by 2050, the median age will be about 38, meaning that half are older than that. So the majority would be under 40? Wait, no, because the median is the midpoint. So if the median is 38, that means 50% are older than 38, and 50% younger. So the majority wouldn't necessarily be under 40; it's almost split. So maybe D is incorrect because the majority would be around that age, but maybe not the majority under 40.

Wait, but perhaps the question is about the majority being under 40. So if the median is 38, then half are under and half over. So the majority (just over half) would be under 40. So D would be correct. But I'm not sure about the exact projections, so I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the majority of the world's population is still young, but the proportion of older people is increasing. So D might be correct.

But wait, the question is about which statement is correct. So I need to evaluate each statement's correctness.

So, let's go back to option F. If developing countries have a faster rate of increase in median age, then F is correct. Because in wealthy countries, the aging process has been happening over a longer period, so the median age is already high and increasing more slowly. Developing countries are catching up, so their median age is increasing more rapidly.

So F is correct.

Now, checking the other options again.

So the correct answer is F.

The question asks which statement about the global aging population is correct. Let's analyze each option:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. Women generally live longer than men, so in older age groups, women outnumber men.  
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Developing countries are experiencing faster increases in median age due to improvements in healthcare and living standards.  
- **Option C**: Incorrect. Advancements in healthcare lead to longer lifespans, increasing the aging population rather than decreasing it.  
- **Option D**: Likely incorrect. While the global population is aging, the majority under 40 may still exist due to high birth rates in some developing countries. However, the median age is projected to rise, making this statement less clear-cut.  
- **Option E**: Incorrect. Women generally have lower mortality rates than men over the life course.  
- **Option F**: Correct. Developing countries are experiencing a faster rate of increase in median age as they catch up with wealthier countries in terms of healthcare and living standards.  
- **Option G**: Incorrect. In older age groups, women outnumber men due to higher female longevity.

The correct answer is **F**, as developing countries are indeed experiencing a greater rate of increase in median age compared to wealthy countries. 

Answer: F
