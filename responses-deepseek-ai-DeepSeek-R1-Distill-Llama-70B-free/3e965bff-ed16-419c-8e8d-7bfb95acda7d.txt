Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the distance to a rock on Mars that's nicknamed "bigfoot." The question says the rock is about 5 cm tall and had an angular size of 0.5 degrees, which is approximately 30 pixels. I need to find out how far away the rock was from the rover, and the options are given in various units like meters and feet.

Hmm, I remember that angular size relates to the actual size of an object and its distance from the observer. There's a formula for that, right? I think it's something like angular size (in radians) equals the actual size divided by the distance. Oh wait, the formula is θ = h / d, where θ is the angular size in radians, h is the height of the object, and d is the distance.

Wait, but the angular size given here is in degrees, not radians. So I need to convert that first. I remember that 180 degrees is π radians, so 1 degree is π/180 radians. So 0.5 degrees would be 0.5 * (π/180) radians.

Let me write that down. θ = 0.5 degrees = 0.5 * π / 180 radians. Let me calculate that. π is approximately 3.1416, so 0.5 * 3.1416 is about 1.5708. Divided by 180 gives me roughly 0.008726 radians.

Wait, but maybe I can just use the small angle approximation. For small angles, the tangent of θ is approximately equal to θ in radians. So tan(θ) ≈ θ when θ is small. So using the formula tan(θ) = opposite / adjacent, which in this case is the height of the object divided by the distance. So 0.008726 ≈ 0.05 m / d.

Wait, the rock's height is 5 cm, which is 0.05 meters. So plugging in, 0.008726 = 0.05 / d. Solving for d, we get d = 0.05 / 0.008726.

Let me compute that. 0.05 divided by 0.008726. Let me see, 0.05 / 0.008 is 6.25, but since it's 0.008726, which is a bit more than 0.008, the result will be a bit less than 6.25. Let's do exact division: 0.05 / 0.008726 = approximately 5.73 meters.

Wait, so that's about 5.73 meters. Looking at the options, option G is about 5 meters, and option I is 10 meters. Hmm, 5.7 is closer to 6, which isn't an option except for A, which is 6 meters. Wait, option A says 6 meters. So that's probably the right answer.

Wait a minute, but I'm a bit confused because the angular size is given as 0.5 degrees, which I converted to radians correctly. But wait, let me double-check the formula. Oh wait, wait, another version of the formula uses the tangent function, but for very small angles, the approximation holds. So yes, I think the calculation is correct.

Alternatively, I could think in terms of pixels. The angular size is about 30 pixels. But I don't know the rover's camera specs, like the field of view or pixel size. So maybe that's not necessary here. The question gives the angular size in degrees, so I can rely on that.

Wait, another approach. The formula for distance can be written as distance = size / tan(angular size). So size is 0.05 m, angular size is 0.5 degrees. So tan(0.5 degrees) is approximately 0.008726. So 0.05 / 0.008726 is about 5.73 meters, which is roughly 5.7 meters. So the closest option is A: 6 meters.

But wait, let me check if I've made a mistake with units. The rock's height is 5 cm, which is 0.05 meters. Yes, that's correct. And the angular size is 0.5 degrees, so the calculation should be right. So the distance is approximately 5.7 meters, so A: about 6 meters is the answer.

To determine the distance to the "bigfoot" rock on Mars, we use the relationship between angular size, actual size, and distance. The formula is:

\[
\theta = \frac{h}{d}
\]

where \( \theta \) is the angular size in radians, \( h \) is the height of the object, and \( d \) is the distance. Since the angular size is given in degrees, we first convert it to radians:

\[
\theta = 0.5^\circ \times \frac{\pi}{180} \approx 0.008726 \, \text{radians}.
\]

The height of the rock is \( h = 5 \, \text{cm} = 0.05 \, \text{m} \). Rearranging the formula to solve for \( d \):

\[
d = \frac{h}{\theta} = \frac{0.05}{0.008726} \approx 5.73 \, \text{meters}.
\]

This value is closest to 6 meters. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: About 6 meters.**
