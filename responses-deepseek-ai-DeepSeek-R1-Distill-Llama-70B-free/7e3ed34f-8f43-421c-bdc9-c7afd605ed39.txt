Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The question is referring to a passage by Sukarno, an Indonesian leader, from his keynote address at the Bandung Conference in 1955. The passage talks about the importance of peace and mentions that the peoples of Asia and Africa, who are 1.4 billion strong, can make a significant impact by injecting reason into world affairs and mobilizing their collective strength on the side of peace. 

So, the question is asking which development this passage is most associated with. The options are from A to J, each representing different historical developments.

First, I need to understand the context of the Bandung Conference. I remember that it was a significant event in the mid-20th century, specifically in 1955. It was a meeting of Asian and African nations, many of which were newly independent from colonial rule. The main goal of the conference was to promote economic and cultural cooperation and to oppose colonialism. It also played a role in the formation of the Non-Aligned Movement during the Cold War.

Looking at the passage, Sukarno emphasizes peace, independence, and collective strength. He's talking about mobilizing the spiritual, moral, and political strength of Asia and Africa. This sounds like it's about countries not aligning with either the Western or Eastern blocs during the Cold War, which is exactly what the Non-Aligned Movement was about.

Now, looking at the options:

A: Global disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation. While the passage mentions peace, it's more about collective action rather than specifically disarmament.

B: Mobilization of pan-Asian ideology. The conference included both Asian and African nations, so it's broader than just pan-Asian.

C: Formation of the European Union. That's a European thing, unrelated to Sukarno's speech.

D: Green Revolution in agriculture. That's about agriculture and food production, not related here.

E: Rise of communism in Asia. Sukarno was a socialist, but the passage isn't promoting communism; it's about neutrality and peace.

F: Formation of the non-aligned movement. This fits because the Bandung Conference is considered a precursor to the Non-Aligned Movement.

G: Development of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. That's a more recent development, not from 1955.

H: Establishment of the United Nations. The UN was already established in 1945, so this isn't directly related.

I: End of colonialism in Africa. While the conference opposed colonialism, the passage is more about unity and peace, not just the end of colonialism.

J: Start of the Cold War. The Cold War started earlier, around the late 1940s, and the Non-Aligned Movement was a response to it, but the passage is about moving away from the Cold War blocs.

So, putting it all together, the passage is most associated with the formation of the non-aligned movement, which is option F.
</think>

The passage by Sukarno from the Bandung Conference in 1955 emphasizes unity among Asian and African nations to promote peace and independence, reflecting the principles of the Non-Aligned Movement. This movement sought to avoid alignment with either the Western or Eastern blocs during the Cold War. 

The correct answer is F: The formation of the non-aligned movement.

Answer: F
