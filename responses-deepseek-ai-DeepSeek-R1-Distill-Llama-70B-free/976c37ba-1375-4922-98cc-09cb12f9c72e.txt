Okay, so I've got this question about a loan and how much cash I can get now if I take a $4,000 loan that's repayable in three years with interest compounded at 0.5% per month. Hmm, I need to find the present value of the loan. I remember that present value calculations involve figuring out what a future sum is worth today, considering the interest rate.

Wait, the formula for present value when compounded is P = F / (1 + r)^n, right? Where F is the future value, r is the monthly interest rate, and n is the number of periods. Oh, right, because it's compounded monthly, I have to use the monthly rate and the total number of months.

So F is $4,000. The interest rate per month is 0.5%, which is 0.005 in decimal. And the time is three years, so that's 36 months. Let me plug these into the formula.

Calculating the denominator first: (1 + 0.005)^36. Hmm, I think I can approximate this. Wait, but exact calculation would be better. Maybe I can use the formula for compound interest. Alternatively, maybe I should just compute 1.005 raised to the 36th power.

I might need to use logarithms or remember that (1.005)^36 is approximately e^(0.005*36) since for small r, ln(1+r) â‰ˆ r. Wait, 0.005*36 is 0.18. So e^0.18 is about 1.1972. But wait, that's an approximation. The actual value might be a bit different.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it step by step. Let me think, 1.005^12 is about 1.061678 (since 0.5% per month for a year gives about 6.17% annually). So for three years, that would be (1.061678)^3. Let's compute that.

1.061678 cubed: 1.061678 * 1.061678 = approximately 1.1268, and then multiplied by 1.061678 again gives roughly 1.1967. So about 1.1967 as the factor.

So the denominator is approximately 1.1967. Then present value P = 4000 / 1.1967. Let me calculate that. 4000 divided by 1.1967. Let's see, 1.1967 * 3342 is roughly 4000? Let me check: 3342 * 1.1967.

Wait, maybe I should do the division. 4000 / 1.1967. Let me approximate:

1.1967 * 3340 = Let's compute 3340 * 1.1967.

Wait, 3340 * 1 = 3340, 3340 * 0.1967 is about 3340 * 0.2 = 668, subtract 3340*(0.0033) which is about 11. So 668 -11=657. So total is 3340 + 657= 3997. Close to 4000. So 3340 would give 3997, so 3342 would give a bit more. So 3342 * 1.1967 is approximately 4000. So P is around $3,342.59.

Looking at the options, option J is $3,342.59. So I think that's the correct answer.

To determine how much cash can be obtained now on a $4,000 loan repayable in three years with interest compounded at 0.5% per month, we calculate the present value using the formula:

\[
P = \frac{F}{(1 + r)^n}
\]

Where:
- \( F = \$4,000 \) (future value),
- \( r = 0.005 \) (monthly interest rate),
- \( n = 36 \) (total number of months).

First, calculate the compound factor:

\[
(1 + 0.005)^{36} \approx 1.1967
\]

Then, compute the present value:

\[
P = \frac{4000}{1.1967} \approx \$3,342.59
\]

From the given options, the closest match is **J: \$3,342.59**.
