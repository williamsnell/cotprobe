Okay, so I have this problem about making nylon 66 with a specific molecular weight, and I need to find the ratio of the initial concentrations of two monomers, F_A(0) over F_B(0). Then, I also need to find the weight fraction of the product that has a degree of polymerization of 200. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on polymer chemistry, but I'll try to think it through.

First, part a: The desired molecular weight M_n is 20000. Nylon 66 is a polyamide, made from a diacid and a diamine. Wait, right, the monomers are hexamethylenediamine and adipic acid. Each of these is a bifunctional molecule, so they should form a linear polymer.

In step-growth polymerization, the number-average degree of polymerization (Xn) is related to the extent of reaction (p). For a condensation polymerization where the reaction goes to completion, but here it says it goes to completion, wait, but I think that when it goes to completion, the extent of reaction p approaches 1. But for calculating the degree of polymerization, the Carothers equation comes into play, which is Xn = 1/(1 - p), but wait, that's when p is the conversion. Wait, no, Carothers equation is typically p = 1 - (1/Xn). Or maybe I have it inverted. Let me think.

Wait, the number average degree of polymerization Xn is given by Xn = (1 + r)/(1 + r - 2rp), where r is the ratio of the two monomers. But if the reaction goes to completion, p approaches 1. So for a stoichiometrically balanced system (r=1), Xn would be very large. But in reality, for high molecular weight, you need r close to 1. But wait, the question says to assume the reaction goes to completion, so maybe we can find Xn from the molecular weight.

The molecular weight of the polymer (M_n) is the degree of polymerization times the molar mass of the repeating unit. So, first, I need to find the molar mass of the repeating unit of nylon 66.

Nylon 66 is made from hexamethylenediamine (which has 6 carbons) and adipic acid (6 carbons). The formula for the repeating unit is -(NH-(CH2)6-NH-OC-(CH2)4-CO)-. So each repeating unit has a certain molecular weight. Let's calculate that.

Hexamethylenediamine is H2N-(CH2)6-NH2. Its molecular formula is C6H16N2. Adipic acid is HOOC-(CH2)4-COOH, which is C6H10O4. When they form the polymer, each monomer loses two small molecules. Each diamine releases two molecules of H2O? Wait, no, wait, when a diamine reacts with a diacid, each condensation step releases a water molecule. So each pair of monomers (one diamine and one diacid) forms a repeating unit and releases one H2O. Let's think about the molecular weight of the repeating unit.

The diamine: C6H16N2 has a molar mass of (6*12) + (16*1) + (2*14) = 72 +16 +28 = 116 g/mol.

The diacid: C6H10O4. Molar mass is (6*12) + (10*1) + (4*16) = 72 +10 +64 = 146 g/mol.

When they react, each pair forms a segment and releases H2O. So the repeating unit would be the sum of the two monomers minus H2O. Let's compute that.

Sum of monomers: 116 + 146 = 262 g/mol.

Subtracting H2O (18 g/mol): 262 -18 = 244 g/mol.

So each repeating unit is 244 g/mol.

Now, the number average molecular weight (M_n) is 20000 g/mol. Since M_n = Xn * M_repeating_unit, where Xn is the degree of polymerization.

So Xn = M_n / M_repeating_unit = 20000 / 244 â‰ˆ 82. So Xn is approximately 82.

Wait, but wait, I thought that in step growth polymerization, the number average degree of polymerization Xn is given by 1/(1 - p), where p is the extent of reaction. But if we're assuming the reaction goes to completion, then p would approach 1, making Xn approach infinity. But that can't be the case here because the M_n given is 20000, which is not infinite. So perhaps the reaction doesn't go 100% to completion, but since the problem says it goes to completion, maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Wait, no, perhaps the reaction does go to completion, but in practice, there's a limit based on stoichiometry. Oh, right, the Carothers equation relates the extent of reaction to the stoichiometric ratio. So, Carothers equation is p = 1 when r =1 (stoichiometric balance), leading to Xn approaching infinity, but that's not possible. So perhaps the situation is that the reaction goes to a certain extent where Xn is 200, but wait, wait.

Wait, the problem is part a and b. Part a is about the ratio of F_A(0)/F_B(0), which I think is the ratio of the monomers' initial concentrations or moles. So for a step-growth polymerization, the stoichiometry must be balanced. So if F_A and F_B are the two monomers, and if they are present in equimolar amounts, then the ratio is 1. But sometimes, in practice, you might have an excess of one to drive the reaction, but in theory, for maximum polymerization, they must be in a 1:1 ratio.

Wait, but if we're assuming the reaction goes to completion, that would imply that the monomers are in exact stoichiometric proportions, so F_A(0)/F_B(0) should be 1. But that can't be the case because many of the options don't have 1 as the first value. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the mole ratio in the feed, not the stoichiometric ratio. But the Carothers equation requires that for maximum conversion, the ratio is 1. So if the ratio isn't 1, the maximum extent of reaction p will be less than 1, thus limiting the molecular weight.

Wait, but the question says the reaction goes to completion. So perhaps they're assuming that the reaction proceeds to the maximum possible extent given the initial ratio. So if the ratio is not 1, then the maximum p is less than 1, and thus the Xn is limited.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. So for a step-growth polymerization, the degree of polymerization is given by Xn = (2 + 2r)/(1 + r) * 1/(1 - p), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, Carothers equation is p = 1 - (1/Xn), but that's under stoichiometric conditions (r=1). If r isn't 1, then perhaps p_max is determined by the limiting reagent.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the equation for the number average degree of polymerization in terms of the stoichiometric ratio and the extent of reaction.

The formula is Xn = (1 + r)/(1 + r - 2rp) when the reaction is not complete. But if the reaction goes to completion, then p is maximum, which is limited by the stoichiometry.

Wait, another approach: For a stoichiometric imbalance, the maximum possible extent of reaction (p_max) is determined by the ratio r. Let me denote r as the ratio of the number of moles of A to B. So if r is not 1, then the maximum p is 1 when both are in excess beyond the stoichiometric ratio.

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Let's try to approach part a again.

Given that the reaction goes to completion, we need to find the ratio of the initial concentrations of F_A and F_B, which I'll assume are the two monomers. Let's say F_A is the diamine and F_B is the diacid. For the polymerization to go to completion (i.e., high molecular weight), the stoichiometric ratio should be 1:1. So the initial ratio F_A(0)/F_B(0) should be 1. But looking at the options, none have 1 as the first value except option E, which is 1.000. But the question's part a might not be that straightforward.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe I'm supposed to use the Carothers equation correctly.

The Carothers equation states that the maximum extent of reaction p_max is given by p_max = 1 when there's an equal number of functional groups, but for a stoichiometric imbalance, p_max is less than 1.

Wait, more accurately, the Carothers equation is Xn = (2 + 2r)/(r(1 - p)) ), but I might have the formula wrong. Alternatively, the correct expression for Xn is Xn = (2(1 + r))/(1 + r - 2r p)}. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should refer to the standard formula for step-growth polymerization. The degree of polymerization Xn is given by:

Xn = (2(1 + r)) / (1 + r - 2r p)

But p is the extent of reaction. If the reaction goes to completion, p approaches 1, but if r is not 1, the maximum Xn is limited.

Wait, but if the reaction goes to completion, p=1. So substituting p=1,

Xn = (2(1 + r)) / (1 + r - 2r *1) ) = (2(1 + r))/(1 + r - 2 r) ) = (2(1 + r))/(1 - r).

But this would cause Xn to go to infinity when r approaches 1, which makes sense because if r=1, the denominator approaches 0, leading to infinite Xn, which is ideal for polymer formation.

Wait, but in our case, Xn is not infinite; it's about 82 as calculated earlier. So this suggests that p is not 1, but we're told that the reaction goes to completion. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps the reaction goes to completion, meaning that the monomers are completely consumed, but that requires r=1, so Xn would be very large, but in our case, M_n is 20000. So perhaps I'm mixing up the concepts.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the number of moles. Let's say we have n_A moles of monomer A (diamine) and n_B moles of monomer B (diacid). The stoichiometric ratio is 1:1, so for complete reaction, n_A must equal n_B. But if they are not equal, the reaction will stop when one is exhausted, leaving excess of the other.

In that scenario, the extent of reaction p is determined by the limiting reagent. So, for example, if n_A = r * n_B, then the maximum p is 1 when r=1. If r is not 1, then p_max is determined by the ratio.

Wait, perhaps I should set up the equations properly.

Let me denote:

n_A = initial moles of A.

n_B = initial moles of B.

r = n_A / n_B.

The reaction is A + B â†’ AB (polymer), and each step consumes one A and one B.

The maximum extent of reaction (p) is such that:

If r >1, then B is the limiting reagent. So the maximum moles that can react is n_B. Thus, moles of A reacted = n_B, and moles of B reacted = n_B.

Similarly, if r <1, then A is limiting, so moles reacted would be n_A for both.

So the extent of reaction for A is p_A = (n_A reacted)/n_A = (n_A reacted)/n_A.

Similarly for B, p_B = (n_B reacted)/n_B.

But since the reaction is A + B â†’ AB, p_A must equal p_B = p.

Wait, but if r = n_A/n_B, then:

At maximum reaction, if r >1, n_A reacted = n_B (since B is limiting), so p_A = n_B / n_A = 1/r.

Similarly, p_B = 1.

If r <1, then n_B reacted = n_A, so p_B = n_A/n_B = r, and p_A =1.

So the extent of reaction p is the minimum of (1/r, 1).

But in the case where reaction goes to completion, perhaps p is determined by the ratio. So let me think about this.

Wait, but the problem states that the reaction goes to completion, which I think implies that p is as high as possible. So for that, the monomer ratio must be exactly 1:1 (r=1), so that p can approach 1, allowing Xn to be high.

But then, in that case, the ratio F_A(0)/F_B(0) is 1, which would correspond to option E's first value, 1.000. But looking at the options, E's first part is 1.000, and the second part is 0.005. But I'm not sure if that's correct, because part b might require a different approach.

Wait, but earlier I calculated that Xn is about 82, given M_n of 20000. So Xn is 82.

But wait, the degree of polymerization for part b is 200, which is higher than 82. So perhaps I'm miscalculating.

Wait, wait, part a says M_n is 20000, so Xn is 20000 / 244 â‰ˆ 82.

Then, part b asks for the weight fraction of the product with a degree of polymerization of 200. So X=200.

Wait, but if Xn is 82, how can there be any polymer with X=200? That seems impossible because the average is 82. So perhaps part b's situation is under different conditions than part a. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is structured such that part a and part b are separate scenarios, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the question is structured as two separate parts: a) find the ratio when M_n is 20000, and b) find the weight fraction when X=200. But that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps both parts are under the same scenario, but the question isn't entirely clear.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed with part a first.

So for part a, given that M_n is 20000, which gives Xn â‰ˆ82, and assuming the reaction goes to completion. So I think the correct approach is to use the Carothers equation, which relates the degree of polymerization to the stoichiometric ratio.

The Carothers equation is p = 1 - (1/Xn), but that's under stoichiometric conditions (r=1). But when r is not 1, the maximum extent of reaction p_max is less than 1, given by p_max = 1 - (1/(r Xn)), but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula when the stoichiometry isn't balanced is Xn = (2(1 + r)) / (1 + r - 2 r p). But if the reaction goes to completion, then p is maximum, which depends on r.

Alternatively, another approach: The number average degree of polymerization is given by Xn = (2 + 2r)/(1 + r) * 1/(1 - p), but when p is maximum, it's when the reaction can't proceed further due to stoichiometric limitations.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of it differently.

In a step-growth polymerization, the maximum degree of polymerization occurs when the reaction goes to completion (p â†’1), but this is only possible if the stoichiometric ratio r is 1. If not, the maximum Xn is limited.

So the formula when the reaction goes to completion is Xn = (1 + r)/(1 - r). Wait, is that correct?

Wait, I think I recall that when r is not 1, the maximum Xn achievable is Xn_max = (1 + r)/(1 - r). So, given Xn, we can solve for r.

In our case, Xn is 82, so 82 = (1 + r)/(1 - r). Let's solve for r.

Multiply both sides by (1 - r):

82 (1 - r) = 1 + r

82 - 82 r = 1 + r

82 -1 = 82 r + r

81 = 83 r

r = 81/83 â‰ˆ 0.9759.

So F_A(0)/F_B(0) is approximately 0.9759. Looking at the options, option C has 0.9765 as the first value, which is close. Option D is 0.9912, which is higher. Option A is 0.9887, which is a bit higher than our calculated 0.9759. Option G is 0.9845, which is a bit higher. So the closest is option C, 0.9765, but our calculation is 0.9759, which is about 0.976, so perhaps option C is the intended answer, but let me check the calculation again.

Wait, 81 divided by 83 is:

83 Ã— 0.9759 = 83 * 0.9759 â‰ˆ 83*(0.975) = 83*(1 - 0.025) = 83 - 2.075 = 80.925, which is close to 81. So yes, r â‰ˆ0.9759.

Looking at the options, option C is 0.9765, which is 0.9765. The difference is 0.0006, which is minor, perhaps due to rounding. So the first part's answer would be approximately 0.976, so option C's first value is 0.9765, which is very close.

Now, moving to part b: What weight fraction of the product has a degree of polymerization of 200.

Wait, the degree of polymerization X is 200, but earlier in part a, we found Xn to be 82. So how can any polymer have X=200 if Xn is 82? That doesn't make sense because the average is much lower than 200. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in understanding the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps part b is under the condition
