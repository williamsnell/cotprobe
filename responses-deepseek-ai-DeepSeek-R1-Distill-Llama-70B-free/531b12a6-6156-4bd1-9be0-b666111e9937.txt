Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. The question is about the work function of potassium metal. The threshold wavelength is given as 564 nm, and I need to find the work function from the options provided.

Hmm, I remember that the work function is related to the threshold wavelength through the photoelectric effect equations. The key equation I recall is Einstein's photoelectric equation: the work function φ is the energy required to eject an electron from the metal. The energy of the incoming photon must be at least equal to the work function for the photoelectric effect to occur.

So the equation should be φ = h * c / λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength. But wait, I should make sure about the units here. 

Let me jot down the values I know:
- Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s.
- The speed of light c is about 3.0 x 10^8 m/s.
- The threshold wavelength λ is 564 nm. Oh wait, nanometers aren't in meters, so I need to convert that. 1 nm is 1e-9 meters, so 564 nm is 564 x 10^-9 m, which is 5.64 x 10^-7 meters.

Wait, wait, no, wait a second. Oh right, no. Let's see, 1 nm is 1e-9 m. So 564 nm is 564e-9 m, which is 5.64e-7 m? Wait no, 564e-9 is 5.64e-7? Wait, 564e-9 is 5.64 times 10^-7? Let me double-check: 1e-9 times 564 is 5.64e-7 meters. Yes, that's correct.

So putting it all together, φ = (6.626e-34 J·s) * (3.0e8 m/s) / (564e-9 m). Let me compute that step by step.

First, calculate the numerator: h*c = 6.626e-34 * 3.0e8. Let me compute that. 6.626e-34 times 3e8 equals... 6.626 * 3 is 19.878, and then the exponents: 10^-34 * 10^8 is 10^(-26). So 19.878e-26 J·m.

Wait no, wait. The units: h is in J·s, c in m/s, so when multiplied, J·s * m/s = J·m. Then, dividing by meters (λ), gives J. That makes sense.

So numerator 6.626e-34 *3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m. Hmm, let me calculate that more precisely. 6.626 *3 is 19.878, so 19.878e-26 (because 1e-34 *1e8 is 1e-26). Oh wait, 6.626e-34 *3e8 = (6.626 *3) * 1e(-34 +8) )= 19.878e-26 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Now, divide that by λ=564e-9 meters. So φ = (1.9878e-25 J·m) / 564e-9 m.

Let me compute the denominator: 564e-9 is 5.64e-7 meters.

So φ = (1.9878e-25) / (5.64e-7) J.

Let me compute 1.9878e-25 divided by 5.64e-7. Let's separate the exponents and the coefficients.

1.9878 /5.64 is approximately... Let's see, 5.64 times 0.35 is about 1.974, which is close to 1.9878. So 0.35 plus a little. Let me compute it more accurately.

5.64 * x =1.9878 → x = 1.9878 /5.64 ≈ 0.3523.

Then the exponents: 1e-25 divided by 1e-7 is 1e-18.

So φ ≈ 0.3523e-18 J. Which is 3.523e-19 J.

Looking at the options, option F is 3.52e-19 J, which matches. So the answer must be F.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations for any possible mistake.

Wait, let me recompute 6.626e-34 *3e8. 6.626 *3 is 19.878. 1e-34 *1e8 is 1e-26. So 19.878e-26 J·m. Then, 19.878e-26 divided by 564e-9 m.

Wait, 19.878e-26 divided by 564e-9 = (19.878 /564) * 1e(-26 - (-9)) )= (0.03523) * 1e-17.

Wait, 19.878/564: Let's compute that. 564 divided by 20 is 28.2, so 19.878 is about 0.352 times 564. So 0.352 approximately.

So 0.352 *1e-17 =3.52e-18 J. Wait, that's 3.52e-18? Wait, that's 3.52 times 10^-18 J, which is 35.2e-19 J. But none of the options have that. Oh wait, wait, perhaps I messed up the exponents.

Wait, let's compute the denominator again. 564e-9 is 5.64e-7 m.

So φ = (6.626e-34 *3e8) / (564e-9) = (6.626 *3 /564 ) * (1e-34 *1e8 /1e-9 ) J.

Wait, 1e-34 *1e8 =1e-26, divided by 1e-9 is 1e-17.

So the exponents part is 1e-17.

Now, the coefficient: 6.626 *3 =19.878, divided by 564.

19.878 /564 → Let me calculate that. Let's do 19.878 ÷564.

564 is approximately 5.64e2. So 19.878 ÷564 ≈ 0.03523.

So 0.03523 * 1e-17 = 3.523e-19 J.

Ah, okay, so that's 3.523e-19 J. Which is approximately 3.52e-19 J, which is option F.

So I think I made a mistake earlier when I thought 19.878e-26 divided by 564e-9 would be in e-18, but no, because 1e-26 divided by 1e-9 is 1e-17.

Wait, but 1e-26 / 1e-9 = 1e-17. So the overall exponent is 1e-17, multiplied by the coefficient 0.03523 gives 3.52e-19 J.

Yes, that's correct. So the work function φ is approximately 3.52e-19 J, which corresponds to option F.

To determine the work function of potassium metal, we use the relationship between the work function (φ) and the threshold wavelength (λ) from the photoelectric effect:

\[
\phi = \frac{h \cdot c}{\lambda}
\]

Where:
- \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s} \) (Planck's constant),
- \( c = 3.0 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \) (speed of light),
- \( \lambda = 564 \, \text{nm} = 564 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m} = 5.64 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{m} \).

### Step 1: Calculate \( h \cdot c \)
\[
h \cdot c = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (3.0 \times 10^8) = 1.9878 \times 10^{-25} \, \text{J·m}.
\]

### Step 2: Divide by \( \lambda \)
\[
\phi = \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25}}{5.64 \times 10^{-7}}.
\]

First, calculate the coefficient:
\[
\frac{1.9878}{5.64} \approx 0.3523.
\]

Next, handle the powers of 10:
\[
10^{-25} / 10^{-7} = 10^{-18}.
\]

Thus:
\[
\phi \approx 0.3523 \times 10^{-18} = 3.523 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

### Step 3: Match with the options
The closest option to \( 3.523 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J} \) is **3.52 × 10⁻¹⁹ J**, which corresponds to **option F**.
