Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about economics. The question is whether achieving full employment is enough to maintain growth. Hmm, I should break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what full employment means. From what I remember, full employment doesn't mean everyone is employed, but rather that everyone who wants to work can find a job. It usually refers to a situation where unemployment is at a very low rate, like the natural rate, which includes frictional and structural unemployment. So, full employment is when the labor market is at its maximum capacity without causing inflation.

Now, the question is whether full employment guarantees growth. I think growth in economics usually refers to economic growth, which is the increase in the production of goods and services over time, often measured as the increase in GDP. So, is having full employment enough to keep the economy growing?

I remember something about Keynesian economics, where aggregate demand drives economic activity. If there's full employment, people have jobs and income, which means they can spend more, increasing demand. Higher demand can lead businesses to produce more, which could drive growth. But wait, I also remember that growth isn't just about demand. Supply-side factors matter too, like technology, productivity, and investment in capital.

So even if the economy is at full employment, if there's no innovation or investment in new technologies, productivity might stagnate. For example, if a country isn't investing in new industries or research and development, it might not see much growth even with everyone employed. Also, factors like resource availability, government policies, and global trade can influence growth beyond just employment levels.

Looking at the options:

A: Growth only depends on full employment. That seems too simplistic. I don't think growth depends solely on full employment because other factors are involved.

B: Yes, full employment guarantees growth. This is a strong statement. I'm not sure if it's that straightforward. Maybe in the short term, but not necessarily in the long run.

C: Full employment always leads to increasing per capita output. Per capita output is GDP per person, so if the population is growing, even with full employment, per capita output might not increase if productivity doesn't grow. So this might not always be true.

D: No, full employment is not sufficient for the maintenance of growth. This seems more accurate because, as I thought earlier, other factors like productivity, innovation, and investment are needed for sustained growth.

So putting it all together, the correct answer would be D because full employment doesn't by itself ensure that the economy will continue to grow. Other elements are necessary for maintaining growth beyond just having low unemployment.

The achievement of full employment, where the labor market is at its maximum capacity without causing inflation, is not sufficient on its own to guarantee the maintenance of economic growth. While full employment can increase aggregate demand through higher consumer spending, economic growth depends on additional factors such as productivity, innovation, investment in technology, and supply-side dynamics. For instance, without advancements in technology or investments in capital, productivity may stagnate, limiting growth. Similarly, global trade and government policies also play crucial roles. Therefore, full employment is necessary but not sufficient for sustained growth.

D: No, full employment is not sufficient for the maintenance of growth.

Answer: D
