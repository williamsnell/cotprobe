Okay, so I have this question here about calculating the interest George will pay on a loan. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

Alright, the question states: George takes a 6-month loan of $300 at 8% interest. I need to find out how much interest he'll pay. The options are from A to J, so I'll figure it out and then match it to one of those.

First, I remember that interest calculations can be either simple or compound, but since it's a short period (6 months), I think simple interest is more likely here. Simple interest is calculated using the formula: I = P * R * T.

Wait, let me make sure. P is the principal amount, which is $300 in this case. R is the annual interest rate, which is 8%, so that's 0.08 in decimal. T is the time in years. Oh, wait, the loan is for 6 months, so that's half a year. So T would be 0.5.

Putting it all together: I = 300 * 0.08 * 0.5. Let me compute that. 300 times 0.08 is 24. Then, 24 multiplied by 0.5 is 12. So the interest should be $12.

Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Another way is to think that 8% annually means 4% for 6 months because 8% divided by 2 is 4%. So 4% of $300 is 0.04 * 300 = $12. Yep, same answer.

Looking at the options, option C is $12. So the correct answer should be C.

The interest George will pay is calculated using the simple interest formula: 

I = P × R × T

Where:
- P = $300 (principal amount)
- R = 8% annually = 0.08
- T = 6 months = 0.5 years

I = 300 × 0.08 × 0.5 = $12

So, the correct answer is C.

Answer: C
