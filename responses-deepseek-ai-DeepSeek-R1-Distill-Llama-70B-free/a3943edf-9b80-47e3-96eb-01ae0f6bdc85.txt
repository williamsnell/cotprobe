Okay, so I've got this physics question here about surface area when small pieces are put together. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let's think through this.

The question says: When small pieces of material are assembled into a larger piece, what happens to the combined surface area? The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Alright, so surface area is the total area of all the exposed surfaces. Let's imagine taking two small cubes and sticking them together. Each cube has 6 faces. When you put them together, say face to face, the touching faces are no longer on the outside. So each cube contributes 5 exposed faces now because one is covered. Originally, each had 6, so two would have 12. But when combined, it's 10. So the total surface area has decreased.

Wait, but wait. How much does it decrease? Let's get specific. Each cube has a surface area of 6s² where s is the side length. If I have two cubes, their combined surface area before assembly is 2*(6s²) = 12s². When I join them on one face, the combined shape has a surface area of 10s². So the surface area went from 12 to 10, which is a decrease of 2s². So the total surface area has gone down.

So in this case, when you assemble small pieces into a larger one, the surface area decreases. But how much? Let's see the options again. The options are about whether it increases, decreases, and by how much.

Looking at the options: A is increase, B is slight increase, E is great decrease, I is slight decrease. So in the cube example, when two are joined, the surface area decreases by 2s², which is a third of the original (12 to 10 is a loss of 1/6th? Wait, 12 to 10 is a decrease of 2/12, which is 1/6th, about 16.67% decrease. Hmm, that's not a huge decrease. So maybe a slight decrease.

Wait, but what if you have more pieces? Let's say more than two. Let's say 8 small cubes forming a larger cube. Each small cube has 6s². So 8 of them have 48s² surface area. But when formed into a 2x2x2 cube, the larger cube has 6*(2s)^2 = 24s². So the surface area is 24s². Oh wait, that's a significant decrease. 48 to 24 is halved. So the surface area is halved when 8 small cubes are combined into a larger cube. So in that case, the surface area is halved, which would be option C.

But wait, the question says "small pieces are assembled into a larger piece". It doesn't specify how they're arranged. So sometimes the surface area could decrease a lot, other times less. But generally, when you combine materials, the surface area tends to decrease because the internal surfaces are no longer exposed.

Wait, but the initial example with two cubes only decreased by a sixth, which isn't a huge change. So it depends on how many pieces you're combining. The question is general. So maybe the general answer depends on whether the surface area increases or decreases.

Wait no, in all cases, when you assemble small pieces, the total surface area would decrease because some surfaces become internal.

But wait, could it ever increase? No, because when you bring two pieces together, the only way surface area changes is when their surfaces are glued. If you have two separate pieces, each has their own surface area. When glued, the overlapping parts are no longer exposed. So the total surface area is sum of individual surface areas minus twice the area of the glued part (since each piece loses that area). So the surface area must decrease.

So the combined surface area is less than the sum of the individual surface areas. So the surface area decreases.

So looking at the options, E is 'greatly decreases', J is 'decreases', I is 'slightly decreases'.

Wait, the question is about the combined surface area. So when you have small pieces, each has their own surface area. When you put them together, some parts are covered, so the total surface area is less than the sum. But how much less?

In the case of two cubes, the surface area decreased by (2/12) or 1/6, which is about 16.67%. So that's a slight decrease. But in the 8 cubes case, it's a 50% decrease, which is a great decrease.

But the question is a general one, not specific to any number of pieces. So what's the general answer? Hmm.

Alternatively, when you break a material into small pieces, the surface area increases because each new piece has new surfaces. But in this question, it's the opposite: assembling into a larger piece. So the surface area would decrease.

Wait, the question is phrased as "when small pieces are assembled into a larger piece, the combined surface area...". So when you combine, the surface area is less than the sum of individual small pieces. So the combined surface area is less; so the correct answer would be a decrease.

Now, how much? Greatly or slightly?

Wait, let's think about it in a more mathematical way.

Suppose each small piece has surface area S. If you have N small pieces, the total surface area is N*S.

When you assemble them into a larger piece, the new surface area is less than N*S because some areas are covered.

But how much less? It depends on the arrangement. If the pieces are just touching on a small point (like barely connected), then the loss in surface area is minimal. Each piece contributes almost all its surface area, minus a tiny bit for the contact point. So the overall surface area would decrease slightly.

But if the pieces are tightly packed, like in the cube example, then the surface area decreases more significantly.

So the question is general, it doesn't specify how the pieces are arranged. So perhaps the answer is that the surface area decreases, but how much?

Looking at the options: E is 'greatly decreases', I is 'slightly decreases', and J is 'decreases'.

Wait, the options don't have a 'decreases' option except J: 'decreases'. But wait the options list J as 'decreases' which is a general decrease, while E and I are about the extent.

Alternatively, the question might be referring to the surface area relative to the sum of the small pieces. If each small piece has a certain surface area, and when combined, the total is less than the sum, so the combined surface area is less than the sum, so the change is a decrease.

But the options are about the change, not the absolute value. So the correct answer would be that the surface area decreases.

But looking at the options, J is 'decreases', which is a general decrease without specifying how much. I is 'slightly decreases', E is 'greatly decreases'.

So which is more correct? The question asks about the combined surface area. So when you have multiple small pieces, each with high surface area, and you put them together, the total surface area is less than the sum. So the surface area decreases.

But the way the options are phrased, the answer could be either E, I, or J.

Wait, the options are:

A: greatly increases

B: slightly increases

C: is halved

D: becomes zero

E: greatly decreases

F: is quadrupled

G: is doubled

H: is unchanged

I: slightly decreases

J: decreases

So the answer choices include 'greatly decreases' and 'slightly decreases', but also 'decreases' as option J.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the surface area of the combined object compared to the sum of the individual pieces. So the surface area is less, so the correct choice is that it decreases. So the correct option is J: decreases.

But I'm a bit confused because in some cases, it decreases a lot, others just a little.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E: 'greatly decreases' because when you have many small pieces, the combined surface area is much less than the sum. But when you have just two, it's a slight decrease.

Wait, but the question says "small pieces" (plural) being assembled into a "larger piece". So perhaps it's more than two. But it's not specified.

Alternatively, think about it this way: when you have more small pieces, the more the surface area decreases when combined. So the general trend is that the surface area decreases.

But how much? For example, in the case of a cube made from 8 smaller cubes: 8*(6s²) = 48s². Combined as a larger cube, 6*(2s)^2=24s². So the surface area is halved, which is a significant decrease. So that's a 'great' decrease. But in the two-cube case, it's a slight decrease.

But the question is general, so perhaps the answer is E: 'greatly decreases'.

Wait, but this depends. If it's a very large number of small pieces, the surface area decreases a lot. But for a small number of pieces, the decrease is less.

Since the question is general, perhaps the correct answer is E: 'greatly decreases', but I'm not entirely sure.

Wait, another approach: the surface area of the combined object is less than the sum of individual surface areas. So the change is a decrease. So the answer is that the surface area decreases.

Looking at the options, J says 'decreases', which is a general answer. E says 'greatly decreases', but that's a matter of degree. So the question is about whether the surface area is halved, becomes zero, etc., but in general, it decreases.

So the correct answer would be J: 'decreases'.

Wait, but when you assemble small pieces, the surface area can't become zero. So D is out. It can't increase, so A and B are out. It can't be halved unless it's a specific number of pieces, so C is not general. It can't be quadrupled (F), doubled (G), or unchanged (H). So the only possible options are E, I, or J.

So the question is whether the surface area decreases, and by how much. Since the question is general, the correct answer is that it decreases, so J is correct. But wait, in the two-cube case, it's a slight decrease, but in the 8-cube case, it's a large decrease. So the answer might be J: 'decreases' as a general statement, without specifying the degree.

Alternatively, the correct answer could be J: 'decreases' as the surface area is now less than the sum of the individual surface areas.

So the answer is J.

When small pieces of material are assembled into a larger piece, the combined surface area changes due to the overlap of surfaces. Each small piece initially has its own surface area, but when assembled, some surfaces become internal and are no longer exposed. This results in a decrease in the total surface area compared to the sum of the individual surface areas of the small pieces.

The extent of the decrease depends on how the pieces are arranged. For example, if two cubes are joined, the surface area decreases slightly, as only one face from each cube is covered. However, if many small pieces are tightly packed into a larger shape, such as a larger cube, the surface area decreases significantly. Despite these variations, the general trend is that the surface area decreases when small pieces are assembled into a larger piece.

Given the options, the most accurate and general answer is that the surface area decreases. While the decrease can vary in magnitude depending on the arrangement, the question does not specify the extent of the decrease, making "decreases" the most appropriate choice.

Answer: J
