Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a bell circuit. Hmm, let me read it again. The circuit has 150 feet of No. 18 wire. Oh right, the wire's resistance is given as 1 ohm. Then there's a bell with 5 ohms resistance, and a battery made of two dry cells, each 1.5 volts. They want the current through the circuit, and the battery's resistance is negligible. So I should probably ignore that part.

Wait, I remember that when calculating current in a circuit, Ohm's Law is usually involved. Ohm's Law is V=IR, right? But wait, that's voltage equals current times resistance. So to find current, I would rearrange it to I=V/R_total.

So first, I need to find the total resistance in the circuit. The circuit has two parts: the wire and the bell. The wire is 150 feet of No. 18, but wait, the resistance is given directly as 1 ohm. Oh, that's easier. So the wire contributes 1 ohm. The bell is 5 ohms. So total resistance R_total is 1 +5 =6 ohms. Wait, no, wait wait. Is the wire both ways? Because in a circuit, the current goes out and comes back, right? So the wire's 150 feet is one way, but the total length for the wire's resistance would be double that. Oh wait, but the question says the wire's resistance is 1 ohm. So maybe that's the total for both ways. So R_wire is 1 ohm, regardless of how it's looped.

So R_total is 1 (wire) +5 (bell) =6 ohms.

Next, the battery. Each dry cell is 1.5 V, and there are two of them. So total voltage is 1.5 *2 =3 volts.

So then, applying Ohm's Law: I = V/R = 3 V /6 Ohms = 0.5 Amps. Wait, but wait, let me think. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me double-check my numbers.

Wait, battery is two cells, each 1.5 V, so yes 3 V total. Resistance is 6 ohms. So 3/6 is 0.5 A. So that would be 0.5 amps. Looking at the options, option G is 0.5 amp. So the current should be 0.5 A.

But wait, wait another thing. Sometimes, people make mistakes about the wire's resistance. Like, if the wire's resistance is 1 ohm for the total loop, then it's fine. Because if it's 150 feet one way, then the return path would be another 150 feet, making 300 feet total. But in the problem, they say the wire has a resistance of 1 ohm, so that's the total for the whole circuit, so 1 ohm is correct. So R total is 6, voltage is 3, so current is 0.5 A.

So the answer should be G.

The problem involves a bell circuit with the following components:

1. **Wire Resistance**: The circuit uses 150 feet of No. 18 wire, which has a total resistance of 1 ohm. This resistance accounts for both the outgoing and return paths of the circuit, so no additional calculation is needed.

2. **Bell Resistance**: The bell has a resistance of 5 ohms.

3. **Battery Voltage**: The battery consists of two dry cells, each with an emf of 1.5 volts. The total voltage supplied by the battery is:

   \[
   V_{\text{total}} = 1.5 \, \text{V} \times 2 = 3 \, \text{V}.
   \]

4. **Total Resistance**: The total resistance in the circuit is the sum of the wire resistance and the bell resistance:

   \[
   R_{\text{total}} = R_{\text{wire}} + R_{\text{bell}} = 1 \, \Omega + 5 \, \Omega = 6 \, \Omega.
   \]

5. **Current Calculation**: Using Ohm's Law, \( I = \frac{V}{R} \), the current through the circuit is:

   \[
   I = \frac{V_{\text{total}}}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{3 \, \text{V}}{6 \, \Omega} = 0.5 \, \text{A}.
   \]

Thus, the current through the circuit is **0.5 amps**, which corresponds to option **G**.
