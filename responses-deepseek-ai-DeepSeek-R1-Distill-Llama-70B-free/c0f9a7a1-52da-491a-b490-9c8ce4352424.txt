Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this economics question here. The question is about combating inflation by raising taxes on disposable income, and I need to determine which type of inflation this action targets. Hmm, let's break this down.

First, I remember that inflation can be categorized into different types based on the causes. The main ones I can think of are demand-pull, cost-push, built-in, and maybe a few others. So the government is raising taxes on disposable income. Disposable income is the amount of money people have left after paying taxes, right? So if the government raises taxes, people will have less disposable income to spend.

Wait, but how does that affect inflation? Inflation is when prices for goods and services are rising. So, what causes that? If people have less money to spend because taxes are higher, they might buy fewer things. That would reduce demand because there's less money chasing goods and services. So, if demand goes down, prices might stop rising or even fall a bit. 

Which type of inflation does this target? Let me think about each option. 

Option A is built-in inflation. I think that's related to expectations. Like, people expect inflation so they demand higher wages, which then causes prices to go up. So raising taxes might not directly affect that because it's more about expectations and wage demands.

Option B is asset inflation, which I believe is about prices of assets like stocks or real estate going up. I'm not sure how raising taxes on income would directly impact that. Maybe through reduced investment, but I'm not certain that's the main target here.

Option C is monetary inflation. That's when there's too much money in circulation, causing inflation. Raising taxes would reduce the amount of money people have, which could decrease the money supply. But wait, the government is taking in more taxes, so maybe they're reducing disposable income, thus reducing spending. So maybe this is about reducing the money in circulation, which would target demand-pull inflation.

Option D is wage inflation. That's when wages rise, leading to higher production costs and thus higher prices. So if people have less disposable income, does that affect wages? Maybe if demand for labor goes down, but I'm not sure that's the direct target here. Plus, I think wage inflation is more about supply and demand in the labor market.

Option E is cost-push inflation. That happens when production costs increase, like raw materials or wages, leading firms to raise prices. Raising taxes on income doesn't directly lower production costs, so maybe this isn't targeting cost-push.

Option F is stagflation, which is a combination of stagnation and inflation, high unemployment, and high inflation. I'm not sure how raising taxes would directly target stagflation. That might require a different approach, maybe monetary policy.

Option G is demand-pull inflation. That's when aggregate demand exceeds the available supply of goods and services. So, if people have less disposable income, they spend less, reducing demand. That would make sense because the government is trying to reduce demand to combat inflation caused by too much demand.

Option H is hyperinflation, which is an extremely high and accelerating inflation rate. While reducing demand could help, hyperinflation is more complex and usually requires more drastic measures, like changing the currency or monetary policy.

Option I is imported inflation. That's when price increases come from abroad, like higher import prices. Raising taxes on income doesn't directly affect imports, so probably not this.

Option J is deflation, which is the opposite of inflation, so that's not relevant here.

So putting it all together, raising taxes on disposable income reduces the amount of money people have to spend. This would lower aggregate demand, which is associated with demand-pull inflation. Therefore, the correct answer should be G: demand-pull inflation.

The government's decision to raise taxes on disposable income aims to reduce the amount of money people have available to spend, thereby decreasing aggregate demand. When aggregate demand exceeds the supply of goods and services, it leads to demand-pull inflation. By reducing disposable income, the government targets this specific type of inflation, as lower demand can help curb rising prices. 

Options like cost-push inflation (E) or wage inflation (D) are not directly addressed by this policy, as they relate more to production costs or labor market dynamics. Similarly, other types of inflation, such as built-in (A), asset (B), or imported (I), are not the primary focus here. The policy specifically targets demand-pull inflation (G) by reducing consumer spending power and thus aggregate demand.
