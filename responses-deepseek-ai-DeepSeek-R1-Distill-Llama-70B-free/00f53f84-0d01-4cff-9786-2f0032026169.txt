Okay, so I've got this question here about the bulk modulus of elasticity. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it.

Alright, the problem says that a liquid is compressed in a cylinder. At a pressure of 1 MN/m², the volume is 1 liter, which is 1000 cm³. Then, when the pressure increases to 2 MN/m², the volume decreases to 995 cm³. I need to find the bulk modulus.

Wait, I remember that the bulk modulus (K) is a measure of how much a material resists compression. The formula, I think, is K = (ΔP) / (ΔV / V₀), where ΔP is the change in pressure, ΔV is the change in volume, and V₀ is the original volume.

So let's plug in the numbers. The initial pressure is 1 MN/m², and the final pressure is 2 MN/m². So the change in pressure (ΔP) is 2 - 1 = 1 MN/m², right? That's 1 MN/m².

The initial volume V₀ is 1000 cm³. The final volume is 995 cm³, so the change in volume ΔV is 995 - 1000 = -5 cm³. Oh wait, volume decreases, so it's negative. But since we're taking the ratio, the negative will go away.

So ΔV is -5 cm³, but the magnitude is 5 cm³. So ΔV / V₀ is 5/1000, which is 0.005.

Wait, but wait a second. I think the formula sometimes uses the change in volume divided by the original volume. So that's (ΔV)/V₀. So in this case, it's (1000 - 995)/1000 =5/1000=0.005.

So the bulk modulus K is ΔP divided by (ΔV/V₀). So ΔP is 1 MN/m², and ΔV/V₀ is 0.005. So K = 1 / 0.005 = 200 MN/m²? Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait, 1 divided by 0.005 is 200. So K would be 200 MN/m²?

But wait, the options are in MPa. Oh right, because 1 MN is 10^6 N, and 1 MPa is 10^6 Pa. Oh wait, wait, no, because 1 MN/m² is 10^6 N/m², which is 10^6 Pa, which is 1 MPa. Wait, no, wait: 1 MPa is 10^6 Pa, and 1 MN/m² is 1e6 N/m², which is 1 MPa. So 1 MN/m² equals 1 MPa.

Wait, wait, because 1 N/m² is 1 Pascal (Pa). So 1 MN/m² is 1e6 Pa, which is 1 MPa. So yeah, the change in pressure is 1 MN/m², which is 1 MPa. So if K is 200 MN/m², that's 200 MPa.

Wait, but let me recheck the calculation. Let me make sure I didn't mess up the steps.

So ΔP is 2 MN/m² minus 1 MN/m², which is 1 MN/m². That's correct.

ΔV is 1000 - 995 =5 cm³. V₀ is 1000 cm³. So ΔV/V₀ is 5/1000=0.005.

So K = ΔP / (ΔV/V₀) = (1 MN/m²) / 0.005. Oh wait, 1 divided by 0.005 is 200. So K is 200 MN/m², which is 200 MPa.

Wait, but looking at the options, option H is 200 MPa. So the answer should be H.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me think again. Oh wait, no. Because sometimes, in some formulas, the bulk modulus is defined as the negative of the ratio of pressure change to volumetric strain. But since the volumetric strain is negative when compressed, the bulk modulus ends up positive. So the formula should be correct as I did, K = ΔP / (ΔV/V₀).

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the units. Let me double-check. Because the pressure is given in MN/m², which is MN per square meter. Oh wait, 1 MN is 1e6 N. So 1 MN/m² is 1e6 N/m², which is 1 MPa, because 1 MPa is 1e6 Pa, and 1 Pa is 1 N/m². So yes, 1 MN/m² is 1 MPa. So ΔP is 1 MPa.

So K is 1 MPa divided by 0.005, which is 200 MPa. So the correct answer is 200 MPa, which is option H.

Wait, but let me check the options again. The options are A:400, B:600, C:750, D:150, E:500, F:250, G:350, H:200, I:100, J:300. So yes, option H is 200 MPa.

To determine the bulk modulus of elasticity, we use the formula:

\[
K = \frac{\Delta P}{\Delta V / V_0}
\]

Where:
- \( \Delta P \) is the change in pressure,
- \( \Delta V \) is the change in volume,
- \( V_0 \) is the original volume.

### Step 1: Calculate \( \Delta P \)
The initial pressure is \( 1 \, \text{MN/m}^2 \), and the final pressure is \( 2 \, \text{MN/m}^2 \). Thus:

\[
\Delta P = 2 \, \text{MN/m}^2 - 1 \, \text{MN/m}^2 = 1 \, \text{MN/m}^2
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( \Delta V \) and \( V_0 \)
The initial volume \( V_0 \) is \( 1000 \, \text{cm}^3 \), and the final volume is \( 995 \, \text{cm}^3 \). Therefore:

\[
\Delta V = V_0 - V_{\text{final}} = 1000 \, \text{cm}^3 - 995 \, \text{cm}^3 = 5 \, \text{cm}^3
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( \Delta V / V_0 \)
\[
\frac{\Delta V}{V_0} = \frac{5 \, \text{cm}^3}{1000 \, \text{cm}^3} = 0.005
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( K \)
Substitute the values into the formula:

\[
K = \frac{\Delta P}{\Delta V / V_0} = \frac{1 \, \text{MN/m}^2}{0.005} = 200 \, \text{MN/m}^2
\]

Convert \( \text{MN/m}^2 \) to \( \text{MPa} \) (since \( 1 \, \text{MN/m}^2 = 1 \, \text{MPa} \)):

\[
K = 200 \, \text{MPa}
\]

### Final Answer
The bulk modulus of elasticity is \( 200 \, \text{MPa} \), which corresponds to option **H**.
