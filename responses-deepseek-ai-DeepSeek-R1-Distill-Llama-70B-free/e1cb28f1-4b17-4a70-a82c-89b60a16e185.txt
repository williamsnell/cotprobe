Question:

You are given Mendel ' s original data on the inheritance of yellow versus green cotyledons. In his experiment, 8023 individuals were scored. Of the 8023, 6022 were yellow and 2001 were green. We expect that yellow and green will appear in a 3:1 ratio respectively. Using the chi-square test (X^2), how well does Mendel's data fit our proposed ratio?

Options:

A: Mendel's data suggests a 2:1 ratio instead of the expected 3:1 ratio
B: The observed ratio is exactly 3:1
C: The data supports a 4:1 ratio rather than the expected 3:1 ratio
D: Mendel ' s data does not fit the proposed ratio
E: The ratio is not close to the proposed ratio
F: Mendel's data is inconclusive due to the large sample size
G: The chi-square test shows significant deviation from the expected ratio
H: The data is inconsistent with Mendel ' s findings
I: The chi-square test indicates a perfect fit with no variation
J: Mendel ' s data fits the proposed ratio very closely

Okay, so I've got this question about Mendel's experiments and the chi-square test. Hmm, I remember that the chi-square test is used to determine how well observed data fits expected data. Right, so Mendel's original data here is about yellow versus green cotyledons.

The numbers given are 8023 individuals total. Out of these, 6022 are yellow and 2001 are green. Wait, let me check those numbers. 6022 plus 2001 is 8023, that adds up. So the observed ratio is 6022:2001. I think I should simplify that ratio. Let's see, dividing both numbers by, say, 1000 roughly, but maybe better to find the greatest common divisor. Alternatively, let me just calculate the ratio as a fraction.

6022 divided by 2001 is approximately 3.01. So that's about 3:1. Oh wait, the question says the expected ratio is 3:1, so the observed is very close to that.

But I'm supposed to use the chi-square test. How does that work again? Oh right, chi-square is calculated as the sum of (observed minus expected)^2 divided by expected for each category.

So first, I need to calculate the expected numbers under the 3:1 ratio. The total is 8023. So the expected yellow would be (3/4)*8023, and green would be (1/4)*8023.

Let me compute those. 3/4 of 8023 is 6017.25 and 1/4 is 2005.75. So expected yellow is approximately 6017 and green 2006 when rounded.

Now, the observed is 6022 yellow and 2001 green. So the differences are 6022-6017=5 for yellow and 2001-2006= -5 for green.

Next, calculate the chi-square value. For each, (O-E)^2 / E.

For yellow: (5)^2 /6017.25 → 25 / 6017.25 ≈ 0.00415.

For green: (-5)^2 /2005.75 → 25 /2005.75 ≈ 0.01246.

Adding them together: 0.00415 + 0.01246 ≈ 0.0166.

Wait, that's a very small chi-square value. The degrees of freedom here is 1, since it's a 2x1 table (two categories, one row). The critical value for chi-square with 1 df at, say, 0.05 is about 3.84. Our calculated value is much lower, around 0.0166.

So that means the observed data is very close to the expected. Therefore, the chi-square test would indicate no significant deviation from the expected ratio. So the data fits the proposed 3:1 ratio well.

Looking at the options:

Option J says Mendel's data fits the proposed ratio very closely. That seems right.

Option I says the chi-square indicates a perfect fit. Well, not exactly, because the calculated value is low but not zero. So maybe J is better.

Option D says the data doesn't fit, which isn't correct. Option G says significant deviation, which is not the case. So the correct answer should be J.

To evaluate how well Mendel's data fits the proposed 3:1 ratio of yellow to green cotyledons, the chi-square test is applied. Mendel's observed data consists of 6022 yellow and 2001 green individuals out of a total of 8023. The expected values under the 3:1 ratio are calculated as follows:

- Expected yellow: \( \frac{3}{4} \times 8023 = 6017.25 \)
- Expected green: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 8023 = 2005.75 \)

The chi-square statistic is calculated using the formula:

\[
\chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O - E)^2}{E}
\]

For yellow:
\[
\chi^2_{\text{yellow}} = \frac{(6022 - 6017.25)^2}{6017.25} = \frac{5^2}{6017.25} \approx 0.00415
\]

For green:
\[
\chi^2_{\text{green}} = \frac{(2001 - 2005.75)^2}{2005.75} = \frac{(-5)^2}{2005.75} \approx 0.01246
\]

Adding these values:
\[
\chi^2 = 0.00415 + 0.01246 \approx 0.0166
\]

The degrees of freedom for this test is 1. The critical value for a chi-square distribution with 1 degree of freedom at a significance level of 0.05 is 3.84. Since the calculated chi-square value (0.0166) is much smaller than the critical value, there is no significant deviation between the observed and expected ratios. This indicates that Mendel's data fits the proposed 3:1 ratio very closely.

Option J correctly states that Mendel's data fits the proposed ratio very closely. Other options, such as G (significant deviation) or D (data does not fit), are incorrect because the chi-square test shows no significant difference. Option I (perfect fit) is also incorrect, as the chi-square value is not zero, indicating minor variation.
