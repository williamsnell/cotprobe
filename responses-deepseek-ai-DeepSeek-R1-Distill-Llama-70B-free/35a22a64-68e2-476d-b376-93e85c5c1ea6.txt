Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me start by reading what the question is asking.

The question has two parts. Part (i) is about finding the circular-mil area of a wire for three different diameters: 0.1 inches, 0.2 inches, and 0.325 inches. Part (ii) deals with the resistance of a copper wire at different temperatures. 

Starting with part (i): I remember that the circular mil is a unit of area used to measure the cross-sectional area of wires. The formula for circular mils is (diameter in inches)^2 multiplied by 1000. Oh wait, no, wait. I think the formula is that the area in circular mils is equal to the diameter squared (in inches) multiplied by π, but wait, no, wait. Wait, no, that's for area in square inches. Let me think again.

Wait, I think the circular mil is defined such that the area in square mils is equal to the diameter in mils squared, and then multiplied by π. Wait, no, maybe that's not right. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is simply (diameter in inches) squared multiplied by 1000 to get the circular mils. Hmm. Because 1 inch is 1000 mils, so (diameter in inches) is converted to mils by multiplying by 1000. So the diameter in mils is 1000 times the diameter in inches. Then, the area in circular mils is (diameter in mils)^2 divided by 1000? Or wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, I think the circular mil area is calculated as the diameter (in inches) squared multiplied by 1000. Because 1 circular mil is the area of a circle with a diameter of 1 mil, which is 0.001 inches. So, the area in square mils is π*(d/2)^2, where d is in mils. But circular mils ignore π because it's a unit that's defined without it, so perhaps the formula is simply (diameter in inches) squared multiplied by 1000. Because, let's see: if the diameter is 0.1 inches, that's 100 mils. So the area in square mils would be π*(50)^2 ≈ 7854 square mils. But since circular mils ignore π, maybe the area in circular mils is (100)^2 = 10,000. Wait, that makes sense. Because for each inch, it's 1000 mils, so (diameter in inches) * 1000 gives the diameter in mils. Then, the area is (diameter in mils)^2 divided by 1000 because 1 circular mil is (1 mil)^2 * π, but since in circular mils they ignore π, the calculation is (d in mils)^2 * (1/π) to get circular mils? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, I remember that the circular mil area is calculated as (diameter in inches)^2 multiplied by 1000. That would make sense because, for example, a 0.1-inch diameter wire would have a circular mil area of (0.1)^2 * 1000 = 10 circular mils? No, wait, no, that can't be right because 0.1 inches is 100 mils. The area would be (100)^2 = 10,000 square mils, but since circular mils are a unit where area is (diameter in mils)^2, so for a 0.1-inch diameter, it's 100 mils, so (100)^2 = 10,000 circular mils. Oh wait, that makes sense. So the formula is (diameter in inches) * 1000 to get mils, then square that to get circular mils. So the formula is simply (d)^2 * (1000)^2 = d^2 * 1,000,000. Wait, no, that can't be right because that would make the area way too big. Wait, no, wait, perhaps the formula is (d in inches)^2 multiplied by 1000. Because 1 inch is 1000 mils, so (d in inches) * 1000 gives the diameter in mils, then square that gives (d * 1000)^2 = d^2 * 1e6, but that's in square mils, and circular mils are area in square mils, but I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is that the area in circular mils is (diameter in inches) squared multiplied by 1000. Let me try an example. Suppose the diameter is 0.1 inches. Then, 0.1^2 is 0.01, multiplied by 1000 gives 10. But that doesn't seem right because earlier I thought a 0.1-inch diameter would be 10,000 circular mils. Hmm, perhaps I'm making a mistake here.

Wait, maybe the formula is (d in mils)^2, without any multiplication. Because 0.1 inches is 100 mils. So 100^2 is 10,000 circular mils. So if the diameter is 0.1 inches, the area is 10,000 circular mils. Similarly, 0.2 inches is 200 mils, so 200^2 is 40,000. Wait, but looking at the options, for part (i) (a), some options have 10,000, others 12,500, etc. So perhaps I'm missing a factor here.

Wait, another approach: The area in square inches is π*(d/2)^2. Then, to convert that to circular mils, we multiply by 10^6 (since 1 square inch is (1000 mils)^2 = 1e6 square mils). But circular mils don't use π, so perhaps the formula is area in circular mils = (d in mils)^2 * (1/π). No, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is (d in mils)^2.

Wait, perhaps I should look for an exact formula. I think the formula for the area in circular mils is (diameter in mils)^2. So, for example, if the diameter is 100 mils (0.1 inches), then the area is (100)^2 = 10,000 circular mils. If diameter is 200 mils (0.2 inches), area is 200^2=40,000. Similarly, 0.325 inches is 325 mils, so area is 325^2 = 105,625 circular mils. Wait, but looking at the options, option D has (c) 105,625, which matches this calculation. Option D's part (i) is (a)10,000, (b)40,000, (c)105,625. So that would make sense.

Now, moving to part (ii): The resistance of a copper wire is 3.60 ohms at 20°C. What's the resistance at 80°C? I remember that the resistance of a material changes with temperature. For metals, resistance increases with temperature. The formula for temperature-dependent resistance is R = R0 * [1 + α*(T - T0)], where α is the temperature coefficient of resistance for the material, and R0 is the resistance at temperature T0.

Copper's temperature coefficient at 20°C is approximately 0.00393 per degree Celsius. So, if the initial resistance R0 is 3.60 ohms at T0 = 20°C, then at T = 80°C, the change in temperature is 60°C. So the resistance R would be R0 * [1 + α*(T - T0)].

Plugging the numbers: R = 3.60 * [1 + 0.00393*(80 - 20)] = 3.60 * [1 + 0.00393*60]. Let me compute that.

First, 0.00393 * 60 = 0.2358. So 1 + 0.2358 = 1.2358.

Then, R = 3.60 * 1.2358 ≈ let's compute this. 3.6 * 1.2358. Let's see, 3.6 * 1 = 3.6, 3.6 * 0.2 = 0.72, 3.6 * 0.03 = 0.108, 3.6 * 0.0058 ≈ 0.02088. Adding them up: 3.6 + 0.72 = 4.32, +0.108 = 4.428, +0.02088 ≈ 4.44888 ohms. So approximately 4.45 ohms.

Looking back at the options, part (ii) in option D is 4.45 ohms, which matches. So option D would have (i) (a)10k, (b)40k, (c)105,625, and (ii)4.45.

Wait, but let me double-check the circular mil calculations. For part (i), each diameter in inches is converted to mils by multiplying by 1000. So (a) 0.1 inches = 100 mils. Area in circular mils is (100)^2 =10,000. So part (a) is 10,000, which is in option D. Similarly, (b) 0.2 inches is 200 mils, area is 40,000. (c) 0.325 inches is 325 mils, area is 325^2 = 105,625. So yes, that's correct.

So part (i) is matched in option D, and part (ii) also matches option D, which gives 4.45 ohms. So the correct answer should be option D.

To solve the problem, we address each part systematically:

### Part (i): Circular-Mil Area of the Wire
The circular-mil area is calculated using the formula:  
\[
\text{Area (in circular mils)} = (\text{Diameter in inches} \times 1000)^2
\]
- For (a) 0.1 inches:  
  \[
  (0.1 \times 1000)^2 = 100^2 = 10,000 \, \text{circular mils}
  \]
- For (b) 0.2 inches:  
  \[
  (0.2 \times 1000)^2 = 200^2 = 40,000 \, \text{circular mils}
  \]
- For (c) 0.325 inches:  
  \[
  (0.325 \times 1000)^2 = 325^2 = 105,625 \, \text{circular mils}
  \]

Thus, the circular-mil areas are:  
(a) 10,000 cir mils, (b) 40,000 cir mils, (c) 105,625 cir mils.

### Part (ii): Resistance of Copper Wire at 80°C
The resistance of copper at different temperatures is calculated using the formula:  
\[
R = R_0 \times [1 + \alpha (T - T_0)]
\]
Where:  
- \( R_0 = 3.60 \, \Omega \) (resistance at 20°C)  
- \( \alpha = 0.00393 \, \text{per °C} \) (temperature coefficient of copper)  
- \( T_0 = 20 \, \text{°C}, \, T = 80 \, \text{°C} \)

The change in temperature is:  
\[
T - T_0 = 80 - 20 = 60 \, \text{°C}
\]

Substituting values:  
\[
R = 3.60 \times [1 + 0.00393 \times 60]
\]
\[
R = 3.60 \times [1 + 0.2358] = 3.60 \times 1.2358 \approx 4.45 \, \Omega
\]

Thus, the resistance at 80°C is approximately 4.45 ohms.

### Final Answer
Comparing the results with the options provided, the correct choice is:  
**D: (i) (a) 10,000 cir mils, (b) 40,000 cir mils, (c) 105,625 cir mils (ii) 4.45 ohms**
