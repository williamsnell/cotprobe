Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this psychology question. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. The question is about Elise hearing a concert ticket giveaway on the radio. She needs to be the seventh caller, so she pulls over to call. While doing that, she repeats the number to herself several times. The question is asking which memory technique Elise used to remember the phone number.

The options are A through J, each corresponding to different memory terms. I remember that psychology has different types of memory and rehearsal techniques. Let me go through the options one by one.

First, I need to understand what each term means.

Option A: Maintenance rehearsal. I think this is when you repeat information over and over to keep it in your short-term memory. Like when you're trying to remember a phone number by saying it repeatedly until you can write it down.

Option B: Chunking. This is organizing information into smaller groups to make it easier to remember. For example, breaking down a long number into smaller parts.

Option C: Long-term memory. That's the storage of information over a long period, like years. But in this case, Elise is just trying to remember the number immediately after hearing it, so maybe not this.

Option D: Iconic memory. That's a type of sensory memory for visual information. So that's not relevant here because she's dealing with auditory information.

Option E: Elaborative rehearsal. This involves deeper processing, like associating new information with something you already know. It's more than just repeating; it's understanding and connecting.

Option F: Selective attention. This is about focusing on specific stimuli while ignoring others. Like when you're in a noisy room but focus on one conversation. She was driving and heard the radio, so she focused on that, but the question is about remembering the number, not focusing on the radio.

Option G: Procedural memory. This is about remembering how to do something, like riding a bike. Doesn't fit here because she's just remembering a number, not a procedure.

Option H: Episodic memory. This is about specific events or experiences, like remembering what you did yesterday. Not relevant here.

Option I: Echoic memory. That's the sensory memory for auditory information. It's a brief storage, like a few seconds. So if she heard the number and it's in her echoic memory, but she's repeating it, which is beyond the initial echo.

Option J: Semantic memory. This is about factual information and general knowledge. Like knowing the capital of a country. But here, she's just remembering a specific phone number temporarily.

So, the key here is that she repeats the number several times. So she's using a rehearsal technique. The two main types are maintenance and elaborative. Maintenance is just repeating without deeper processing. Elaborative involves making connections or meaning.

In the scenario, she's just repeating the number, not thinking about it deeply or connecting it to anything else. So that points to maintenance rehearsal, which is option A.

Wait, could it be echoic memory? Because she heard it on the radio. Echoic memory is the brief storage, but she's actively trying to remember it by repeating, so that's more about rehearsal in the short-term memory. So I think maintenance rehearsal is the right answer.

Elise was repeating the phone number to herself several times to remember it, which indicates she was using a rehearsal technique. The correct term for this is **maintenance rehearsal**, where information is repeated to retain it in short-term memory.

Answer: A
