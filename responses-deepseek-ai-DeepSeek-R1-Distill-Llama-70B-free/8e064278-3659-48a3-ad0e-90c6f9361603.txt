Okay, so I've got this problem here about Punk Magazine's ad costs. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is asking for the cost per thousand for a single ad. 

Alright, so let's see. The magazine has a circulation of 2,000,000. That means each magazine goes out to two million people, right? And they charge $20,000 for a full-page ad. Now, I need to find out how much it costs per thousand people reached.

Wait, cost per thousand, that's like CPM, cost per mille, yeah. So the formula I remember is taking the total cost and dividing it by the number of thousands in the circulation. Oh wait, no, wait. Let me think again. If the ad reaches 2,000,000 people, then for every thousand people, how much do they charge.

So, the total cost is $20,000 for reaching 2,000,000. So to find the cost per thousand, I should divide the total cost by the circulation in thousands. Oh right, because 2,000,000 is 2000 thousands.

So, calculation would be $20,000 divided by 2,000. Let me do that. 20,000 divided by 2,000 is 10. So that would make the cost per thousand $10. 

Wait, but let me double-check. If 2,000,000 is 2000 times 1000, then each thousand would cost 20,000 / 2000 = 10. Yep, that makes sense. So the cost per thousand is $10. 

Looking at the options, option F is $10. So the answer should be F.

The cost per thousand (CPM) is calculated by dividing the total ad cost by the circulation in thousands. With a circulation of 2,000,000 (which is 2000 thousands) and an ad cost of $20,000, the calculation is:

\[
\text{CPM} = \frac{\$20,000}{2000} = \$10
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

F: $10

Answer: F
