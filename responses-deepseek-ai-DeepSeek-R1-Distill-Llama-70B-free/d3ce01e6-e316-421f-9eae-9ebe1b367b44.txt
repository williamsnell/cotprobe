Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about mothers' memories regarding their children's developmental and social histories. Hmm, interesting. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which aspect mothers are most accurate about when recalling their children's histories. The options are A through F, each covering different areas like interpersonal relations, child-rearing practices, academic performance, specific events, motor development, and school relations.

I remember from some psychology classes that memory accuracy can vary based on the type of information. For example, specific events and dates might be harder to remember accurately over time because they're more detailed and time-sensitive. On the other hand, more general information or things that happen regularly might be easier to recall.

Mothers often track their children's physical growth, like how much they weighed at different ages or when they started walking. These milestones are pretty significant and parents usually note them down or remember them clearly. So motor development and weight gain (option E) might be something they're accurate about.

Child-rearing practices (option B) are also routines that parents follow, so maybe they remember those well. But the question is about accuracy when giving developmental and social histories. Motor skills and growth are part of developmental milestones, which are concrete and often tracked.

As for specific events and dates (option D), those might be less accurate because they can fade over time unless written down. So I'm leaning towards E being the correct answer because it's about specific, trackable developmental milestones that mothers are likely to remember accurately.

The correct answer is E: motor development and weight gain. Mothers are most accurate when recalling specific, trackable developmental milestones such as motor development and weight gain.

Answer: E
