Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see... The expression is 1990 multiplied by 1991 minus 1989 multiplied by 1990. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but maybe I can simplify it somehow.

First, I should write down the expression to make it clearer. So, it's 1990 * 1991 - 1989 * 1990. Wait, I notice that both terms have 1990 as a factor. Oh, right! Maybe I can factor that out. That might make things easier.

So, factoring 1990 out, I can rewrite the expression as 1990 times (1991 minus 1989), right? Because 1990 is common in both terms. Let me check that: 1990*(1991) - 1990*(1989) equals 1990*(1991-1989). Yeah, that makes sense.

Now, let's compute what's inside the parentheses. 1991 minus 1989. Hmm, 1991 is two more than 1989, so 1991 - 1989 equals 2. So now the expression becomes 1990 * 2.

Wait, 1990 times 2 is 3980. So the result should be 3980. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake there. 1990 * 2 is indeed 3980. So the answer should be 3980, which is option B.

But wait, let me think again to make sure I didn't skip any steps. Maybe I should calculate each multiplication separately and then subtract. Let's try that approach to double-check.

First, calculate 1990 * 1991. Well, 1990 times 1991. Hmm, that's a big number. But maybe I can find a way to compute it without a calculator. Alternatively, perhaps using another factoring method.

Wait, another approach: 1990*1991 can be written as 1990*(2000 - 9) because 1991 is 2000 minus 9. Let me compute that. 1990*2000 is 3,980,000. Then, 1990*9 is 17,910. So subtracting, 3,980,000 - 17,910 gives me 3,962,090.

Now, the second term: 1989 * 1990. Let me compute that. Maybe write 1989 as 2000 - 11. So 1989 = 2000 - 11. Then, 1989 * 1990 = (2000 - 11) * 1990. Let's expand that. 2000*1990 is 3,980,000 and 11*1990 is 21,890. So subtracting, 3,980,000 - 21,890 equals 3,958,110.

Wait, no, wait, that's not right. Because 1989 is 2000 - 11, so when I multiply by 1990, it's 2000*1990 minus 11*1990. So 2000*1990 is 3,980,000. 11*1990 is 21, 890. So 3,980,000 minus 21,890 is 3,958,110. So 1989*1990 is 3,958,110.

Now, subtracting the two terms: 1990*1991 is 3,962,090 and 1989*1990 is 3,958,110. So 3,962,090 minus 3,958,110 equals... Let me subtract. 3,962,090 - 3,958,110. Subtracting the thousands: 962,090 - 958,110. That's 3,980. Wait, so that gives me 3,980 again. So that's the same result as before. So yeah, 3980 is the correct answer.

So the options are, option B is 3980. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but I just thoughtâ€”maybe I should have another way to approach this problem. Let's see, another method. Perhaps using algebraic identities. Let me think.

The expression is 1990 * 1991 - 1989 * 1990. Let's factor 1990 out, which we did before, giving 1990*(1991 - 1989) = 1990*2 = 3980.

Alternatively, maybe there's an identity that can be applied here. Let me think: a*b - c*b = b*(a - c). So yeah, same as factoring.

Alternatively, think of 1991 as (1989 + 2). So 1990*(1989 + 2) - 1989*1990. Expanding, that's 1990*1989 + 1990*2 - 1989*1990. The 1990*1989 terms cancel out, leaving 1990*2, which is 3980.

So that's another way to see it. So regardless of the method, the result is the same.

I think I'm confident that the correct answer is 3980, which is option B.

The expression given is \(1990 \times 1991 - 1989 \times 1990\). To simplify, notice that both terms share a common factor of 1990. Factoring this out, the expression becomes:

\[
1990 \times (1991 - 1989)
\]

Next, compute the subtraction inside the parentheses:

\[
1991 - 1989 = 2
\]

Now, multiply:

\[
1990 \times 2 = 3980
\]

Thus, the result of the expression is 3980. This corresponds to option **B**.
