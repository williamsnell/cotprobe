Okay, so I've got this question here that asks about the minimum number of people needed in a group to ensure that at least two of them have birthdays in the same month. Hmm, I think I remember something about this from math class. Oh right, it's probably the pigeonhole principle!

Wait, what's the pigeonhole principle again? I think it's that if you have more pigeons than pigeonholes, at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon. So in this case, the pigeons are the people and the pigeonholes are the months.

There are 12 months in a year, right? So each person's birthday can be in one of these 12 months. So if I have 12 people, it's possible that each person has a birthday in a different month. But if I add one more person, making it 13, then there's no way all can have unique months. At least two must share the same month.

Let me make sure I'm thinking this through correctly. So the question is asking for the minimum number where it's guaranteed. So 12 people could all have different months, but 13 would definitely have a collision. So the answer should be 13.

Looking at the options, option G is 13. So I think that's the right choice. I don't think I'm missing anything here. It's a straightforward application of the pigeonhole principle.

The question asks for the minimum number of people needed in a group to guarantee that at least two have birthdays in the same month. Using the pigeonhole principle, where the "pigeons" are people and the "pigeonholes" are the 12 months, we determine that 12 people could each have birthdays in different months. However, with 13 people, at least two must share the same month. Thus, the answer is 13.

G: 13

Answer: G
