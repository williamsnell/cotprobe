Okay, so I need to find the fugacity coefficient of a gas that follows a specific equation of state and then use that to estimate the fugacity of argon under certain conditions. Hmm, I remember that fugacity has to do with the effective pressure of a real gas, right? It's like a correction factor for non-ideal behavior.

The equation of state given is pV_m = RT(1 + B/V_m + C/V_m²). I think the general approach to finding the fugacity coefficient involves integrating some expression related to pressure or compressibility factor. Oh wait, the fugacity coefficient φ is given by the integral of (Z-1)/P dP from 0 to P, or something like that. Wait, no, I think it's expressed using the integral involving the equation of state.

Wait, the formula for fugacity coefficient when using the virial equation of state. Oh right! For a virial expansion, which this equation looks like. The virial equation of state is usually written as pV_m = RT [1 + B(T)/V_m + C(T)/V_m² + ...]. So the given equation is a second virial coefficient B and third C.

The fugacity coefficient φ is given by the exponential of the integral from 0 to P of (V_m - RT/p)/RT dP. Or wait, another approach: using the virial expansion, the fugacity coefficient can be expressed in terms of the virial coefficients.

I recall that for the virial equation of state, the fugacity coefficient can be found using the expansion up to the second or third virial coefficients. The formula is ln φ = (2Bρ + (3/2)C ρ²) where ρ is the density, but wait, I might be mixing up different forms. Alternatively, the expression might involve the virial coefficients in terms of pressure.

Wait, the virial equation can be expressed in terms of pressure as Z = 1 + B' p + C' p² + ..., where B' and C' are the second and third virial coefficients in terms of pressure. Then, the fugacity coefficient is ln φ = 2B' p + (3/2) C' p² + ... 

But wait, let me think again. The virial equation in terms of volume is Z = 1 + B/V_m + C/V_m² + ..., and converting this to a pressure expansion would help. Alternatively, I think the fugacity coefficient is given by the integral from 0 to P of (Z-1)/P dP.

Since Z = pV_m/(RT), from the equation, Z = [p V_m]/(RT) = 1 + B/(V_m) + C/(V_m)^2.

Hmm, but I need to express this in terms of pressure. Maybe it's easier to express everything in terms of the compressibility factor Z, which is Z = pV_m/(RT). So the equation becomes Z = 1 + B/(V_m) + C/(V_m)^2. Let me express this in terms of density. Since V_m = RT/(p), if I use the ideal gas relation, but wait, that's only for an ideal gas. Hmm, maybe I can substitute V_m in terms of Z.

Wait, Z = (p V_m)/(RT) → V_m = Z RT / p. So substituting that into the equation:

Z = 1 + B/( (Z RT)/p ) + C/( (Z RT)^2 / p² )

So Z = 1 + B p/(Z RT) + C p²/(Z² (RT)^2 )

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can rearrange it. Let me multiply both sides by Z² to make it easier:

Z³ = Z² + (B p/(RT)) Z + (C p²)/(RT)^2 )

But this is a cubic equation in Z, which might not be straightforward to solve. However, perhaps for low pressures, we can approximate Z with a Taylor expansion. Let's say Z ≈ 1 + δ, where δ is small.

Substituting Z ≈ 1 + δ into the equation:

(1+δ)^3 ≈ (1+δ)^2 + (B p/(RT)) (1+δ) + (C p²)/(RT)^2 )

Expanding each term:

Left side: 1 + 3δ + 3δ² + δ³
Right side: [1 + 2δ + δ²] + [B p/(RT) (1 + δ) ] + [C p²/(RT)^2 ]

Neglecting higher order terms beyond δ²:

Left: 1 +3δ +3δ²
Right: 1 + 2δ + δ² + B p/(RT) + B p δ/(RT) + C p²/(RT)^2 

Subtracting 1 from both sides:

3δ +3δ² ≈ 2δ + δ² + B p/(RT) + B p δ/(RT) + C p^2/(RT)^2 

Bring all terms to left:

3δ +3δ² -2δ - δ² - B p/(RT) - B p δ/(RT) - C p²/(RT)^2 ≈ 0

Simplify:

(3δ -2δ) + (3δ² - δ²) - B p/(RT) - B p δ/(RT) - C p²/(RT)^2 ≈0
→ δ (1) + δ² (2) - B p/(RT) - B p δ/(RT) - C p²/(RT)^2 ≈0

Arrange terms in order of δ:

δ (1 - B p/(RT) ) + δ² (2) = B p/(RT) + C p²/(RT)^2 

Hmm, but this is getting a bit messy. Maybe it's better to take a different approach. Let me remember that for the virial equation of state in terms of pressure, the fugacity coefficient is given by:

ln φ = 2B' p + (3/2) C' p^2 + ... 

Where B' is the second virial coefficient in pressure terms, and C' the third. But I need to relate that to the given equation.

Wait, the given equation is in terms of 1/V_m. So perhaps I can write it as:

p = RT/(V_m - b) + a/(V_m²) + ... ?

Wait, no, the given equation is p V_m = RT (1 + B/V_m + C/V_m^2). Let me rearrange this:

p = (RT)/(V_m) [ 1 + B/V_m + C/V_m^2 ]

Which is p = RT/(V_m) + (RT B)/V_m^2 + (RT C)/V_m^3.

Wait, comparing this to the virial equation in terms of 1/V_m: pV_m = RT [1 + B/V_m + C/V_m^2], which is the same as the virial equation of state expressed as:

Z = 1 + B/V_m + C/V_m^2.

Alternatively, the virial equation can also be written in terms of the number density ρ = 1/V_m. So, Z = 1 + B ρ + C ρ^2.

So, Z = 1 + B ρ + C ρ².

The fugacity coefficient is given by:

ln φ = ∫ (Z -1)/ (ρ) dρ, integrated from 0 to the current density.

Wait, no, I think the integral is with respect to pressure. Another approach: the fugacity coefficient can be found using:

ln φ = ∫ (from 0 to p) (V_m - (RT/p)) / (RT) ) dp.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me check the formula again. The fugacity coefficient is given by:

ln φ = ∫ (from 0 to p) (Z - 1)/p dp.

Since Z = pV_m/(RT) → (Z-1)/p = (V_m/(RT) - 1/p). Hmm, no, let's see. (Z-1)/p = (p V_m/(RT) -1)/p = V_m/(RT) - 1/p.

Wait, no, (Z-1)/p = (p V_m/(RT) -1 ) / p = (V_m/(RT) ) - 1/p.

But how to express this in terms of p? Because Vm is a function of p.

Alternatively, for the virial equation, when expressed as Z = 1 + Bρ + C ρ^2, and since ρ=1/V_m, we can write in terms of pressure.

Wait, I think the correct formula for the fugacity coefficient when the equation of state is given by Z = 1 + Bρ + C ρ^2 is:

ln φ = 2Bρ + (3/2) C ρ².

Wait, wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me think again. The general formula is:

ln φ = ∫ (from 0 to p) (Z-1)/p dp.

Since Z = 1 + B ρ + C ρ², where ρ = 1/V_m. But V_m = RT/(p), assuming ideal gas? No, that's not correct because V_m is from the real equation of state.

Hmm, perhaps I can express ρ in terms of p. From the ideal gas law, ρ = p/(RT) (1/Z). But Z is given by the equation, so this might complicate things.

Alternatively, let me use the virial equation in terms of pressure. The virial equation can be written as:

Z = 1 + B' p + C' p² + ...,

where B' is the second virial coefficient in terms of p, and C' the third. Then, the fugacity coefficient is:

ln φ = (2 B' + (3/2) C' p) p/1! + ... ?

Wait, no, I think the expression is:

ln φ = 2 B' p + (3/2) C' p² + ..., but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, another approach: use the virial equation in terms of 1/V_m. So, Z = 1 + B/(V_m) + C/(V_m)^2.

Expressed in terms of p, since p = nRT/V = (RT)/V_m. So, V_m = RT/(p), assuming ideal gas behavior. Wait, but in reality, V_m is RT/(p) times Z. Because p V_m = nRT → V_m = nRT/(p) → V_m = (RT)/(p) * n → since n is 1 mole, V_m = RT/(p). Hmm, no, because for real gases, V_m isn't exactly RT/p. So perhaps I should use Z = p V_m/(RT) → V_m = Z RT/(p).

So substituting V_m into the equation Z = 1 + B/(V_m) + C/(V_m)^2:

Z = 1 + B (p)/(Z RT) + C (p²)/( (Z RT)^2 )

Hmm, this seems tricky, but perhaps for an approximate solution, I can ignore higher-order terms beyond B and C. Let me rearrange this equation.

Multiply both sides by Z^2 to expand:

Z^3 = Z^2 + (B p/(RT)) Z + (C p^2/(RT)^2 )

Assuming that Z is close to 1 (since at low pressures, the gas is nearly ideal), let's let Z = 1 + δ, where δ is small. Then:

(1 + δ)^3 ≈ 1 + 3δ + 3δ² + δ^3 ≈ 1 + 3δ + 3δ².

The right side becomes (1 + 2δ + δ²) + (B p/(RT))(1 + δ) + (C p²/(RT)^2 )

So:

1 + 3δ + 3δ² ≈ 1 + 2δ + δ² + (B p/(RT)) + (B p δ/(RT)) + (C p²/(RT)^2 )

Subtract 1 from both sides:

3δ +3δ² ≈ 2δ + δ² + (B p/(RT)) + (B p δ/(RT)) + (C p²/(RT)^2 )

Bring everything to the left:

3δ +3δ² -2δ - δ² - (B p/(RT)) - (B p δ/(RT)) - (C p²/(RT)^2 ) ≈ 0.

Simplify:

(3δ - 2δ) + (3δ² - δ²) = B p/(RT) + B p δ/(RT) + C p²/(RT)^2.

So:

δ (1) + δ² (2) = B p/(RT) (1 + δ) + C p²/(RT)^2.

Assuming δ is small, terms with δ on the right can be neglected, so approximately:

δ + 2 δ² ≈ (B p)/(RT) + (C p²)/(RT)^2.

But since δ is small, δ² is much smaller than δ, so perhaps we can approximate δ ≈ (B p)/(RT) + (C p^2)/(RT)^2.

Wait, but wait, the left side is δ + 2 δ² ≈ (B p)/(RT) + (C p²)/(RT)^2.

If δ is small, then 2 δ² is negligible compared to δ. So we can approximate δ ≈ (B p)/(RT) + (C p^2)/(RT)^2.

So Z = 1 + δ ≈ 1 + (B p)/(RT) + (C p^2)/(RT)^2.

Hmm, but earlier I thought Z was expressed in terms of virial coefficients, so perhaps this approximation is sufficient.

Now, the fugacity coefficient is given by the integral:

ln φ = ∫ (from 0 to p) (Z-1)/p dp'.

Since Z = 1 + B/(V_m) + C/(V_m)^2.

But using our approximation, Z ≈ 1 + (B p)/(RT) + (C p^2)/(RT)^2.

Wait, but in the integral, (Z-1) would be (B p)/(RT) + (C p²)/(RT)^2.

So,

ln φ = ∫ [ (B p)/(RT) + (C p²)/(RT)^2 ] / p dp'

= ∫ [ B/(RT) + C p/(RT)^2 ] dp'

Integrate from 0 to p:

= (B/(RT)) p + (C p²)/(2 (RT)^2 )

So,

ln φ = (B p)/(R T) + (C p²)/(2 (R T)^2 )

This gives the natural log of the fugacity coefficient. Then φ is e raised to that value.

Wait, but what about the units? Let me check the units. B is given in cm³/mol, C in cm^6/mol². Pressure is in atm, but I need to convert everything to consistent units.

Wait, the given data is for argon at 1.00 atm and 100 K. The virial coefficients B and C are given as -21.13 cm³/mol and 1054 cm^6/mol², respectively.

So, R is 82.057 cm³·atm/(mol·K). Because R is 0.082057 L·atm/(mol·K), and 1 L = 1000 cm³, so 0.082057 * 1000 = 82.057 cm³·atm/(mol·K).

So, let's compute each term.

First term: (B p)/(R T).

p = 1.00 atm.

T = 100 K.

B = -21.13 cm³/mol.

So,

(B p)/(R T) = (-21.13 cm³/mol * 1.00 atm) / (82.057 cm³·atm/(mol·K) * 100 K )

The cm³ and atm units cancel out, leaving 1/mol. Wait, but wait, let me compute numerically.

= (-21.13) / (82.057 * 100 )

= (-21.13) / (8205.7 )

≈ -0.002576.

Second term: (C p²) / (2 (R T)^2 )

C = 1054 cm^6/mol².

p =1.00 atm.

So,

(1054 cm^6/mol² * 1^2 atm²) / ( 2 * (82.057 cm³·atm/(mol·K) * 100 K )^2 )

Simplify denominator:

(82.057 * 100 )² = (8205.7 )² = let me calculate that.

8205.7^2 = approx (8.2057e3)^2 = 6.72e7? Let me compute exact:

8205.7 * 8205.7 = Let's see, 8200^2 is 67,240,000. Then corrections for 5.7.

But perhaps I can compute it as (8205.7)^2 = (8.2057e3)^2 = (8.2057)^2 * 1e6.

8.2057^2 ≈ 67.25 (since 8^2=64, 8.2^2=67.24, so 8.2057^2≈67.25). So (8.2057e3)^2 ≈ 67.25e6 = 6.725e7.

So denominator is 2 * 6.725e7 (cm^6·atm²/(mol²·K²)).

So,

numerator: 1054 cm^6/mol² * 1 atm².

So,

term = (1054) / (2 * 6.725e7 )

= 1054 / (1.345e8 )

≈ approximately 7.83e-6.

So the second term is about 0.00000783.

So ln φ ≈ (-0.002576 ) + (0.00000783 ) ≈ -0.002568.

So φ = exp( -0.002568 ) ≈ 1 - 0.002568 + ... since for small x, e^x ≈ 1 + x.

So φ ≈ 0.9974 atm.

Wait, but wait, let me compute it more accurately. The natural exponent of -0.002568.

Let me compute it precisely. Let me use the formula e^x ≈ 1 + x + x²/2.

x = -0.002568.

x² = (0.002568)^2 ≈ 6.59e-6.

So,

e^x ≈ 1 + (-0.002568) + (6.59e-6)/2 = 0.997432 + 3.295e-6 ≈
