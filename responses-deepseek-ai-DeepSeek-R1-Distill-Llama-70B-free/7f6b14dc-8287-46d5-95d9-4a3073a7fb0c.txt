Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the sum of all positive integer values of n such that n squared is a factor of 1200. Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First off, I remember that for a number to be a factor of another, it has to divide it completely without leaving a remainder. So here, n squared must divide 1200 exactly. That means when we divide 1200 by n squared, it should result in an integer.

Wait, but to find all such n, I probably need to look at the prime factorization of 1200, right? Because that will help me figure out all the possible factors. Let me start by factoring 1200 into its prime components.

1200 can be broken down as follows: 1200 divided by 2 is 600, then 300, then 150, then 75. So that's four 2s. Then 75 divided by 3 is 25, so one 3. Then 25 is 5 squared, so two 5s. So putting that all together, 1200 is 2^4 * 3^1 * 5^2.

Now, any factor of 1200 will have exponents in its prime factors that are less than or equal to those in 1200. So for a number n^2 to be a factor, n^2's prime factors must fit within 1200's.

Wait, but n squared means that each exponent in its prime factors must be even, right? Because when you square a number, you double each exponent. So for example, if n has a prime factor 2^a, then n squared has 2^(2a). For n squared to divide 1200, each exponent in its prime factorization must be less than or equal to the corresponding exponent in 1200.

So let me think about each prime factor separately.

Starting with 2: In 1200, the exponent is 4. So in n squared, the exponent for 2 must be less than or equal to 4. But since n squared's exponents are even, the possible exponents are 0, 2, 4. Because 6 would be higher than 4, which isn't allowed. So for 2, possible exponents are 0, 2, or 4.

Next, 3: The exponent in 1200 is 1. So for n squared, the exponent for 3 must be <=1. But since n squared's exponent must be even, the only options are 0. Because 2 is larger than 1, which isn't allowed. So for 3, only 0 is possible.

Then, 5: The exponent in 1200 is 2. So in n squared, it must be <=2. The possible even exponents are 0 and 2. Because 4 would be higher than 2, which isn't allowed. So for 5, 0 or 2.

So now, the exponents for each prime in n squared can be:

- For 2: 0, 2, 4
- For 3: 0
- For 5: 0, 2

Now, to find all possible combinations, I can multiply the number of choices for each prime. So 3 choices for 2 (0,2,4), 1 choice for 3 (only 0), and 2 choices for 5 (0,2). So 3 * 1 * 2 = 6 possible combinations.

Let me list each combination and calculate the corresponding n:

1. 2^0 * 3^0 *5^0 = 1 → n^2=1 → n=1
2. 2^2 *3^0 *5^0 =4 →n=2
3. 2^4 *3^0 *5^0=16 →n=4
4. 2^0 *3^0 *5^2=25 →n=5
5. 2^2 *3^0 *5^2=4 *25=100 →n=10
6. 2^4 *3^0 *5^2=16*25=400 →n=20

Wait, wait, let me make sure I didn't miss any. So for each possible exponent of 2, I can pair with each exponent of 5.

So that's 3 possibilities for 2 (0,2,4) and 2 for 5 (0,2), giving 3*2=6, which matches the list above.

Now, the values of n are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20.

Now, I need to sum all these n's. Let's add them up:

1 + 2 = 3

3 +4 =7

7 +5=12

12 +10=22

22 +20=42

So the sum is 42.

Looking at the options, D is 42. So the answer should be D.

To solve the problem, we start by determining the prime factorization of 1200:

\[
1200 = 2^4 \cdot 3^1 \cdot 5^2
\]

For \( n^2 \) to be a factor of 1200, the exponents in the prime factorization of \( n^2 \) must be less than or equal to those in 1200. Since \( n^2 \) has even exponents (as squaring doubles the exponents), we analyze each prime factor:

1. **For \( 2^4 \):** The possible exponents in \( n^2 \) are 0, 2, or 4 (even numbers up to 4).
2. **For \( 3^1 \):** The only possible exponent in \( n^2 \) is 0 (since 2 exceeds 1).
3. **For \( 5^2 \):** The possible exponents in \( n^2 \) are 0 or 2 (even numbers up to 2).

Combining these, the possible values of \( n^2 \) are:

\[
n^2 = 2^0 \cdot 3^0 \cdot 5^0 = 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad n = 1
\]
\[
n^2 = 2^2 \cdot 3^0 \cdot 5^0 = 4 \quad \Rightarrow \quad n = 2
\]
\[
n^2 = 2^4 \cdot 3^0 \cdot 5^0 = 16 \quad \Rightarrow \quad n = 4
\]
\[
n^2 = 2^0 \cdot 3^0 \cdot 5^2 = 25 \quad \Rightarrow \quad n = 5
\]
\[
n^2 = 2^2 \cdot 3^0 \cdot 5^2 = 100 \quad \Rightarrow \quad n = 10
\]
\[
n^2 = 2^4 \cdot 3^0 \cdot 5^2 = 400 \quad \Rightarrow \quad n = 20
\]

The positive integer values of \( n \) are \( 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20 \). Summing these values:

\[
1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 20 = 42
\]

Thus, the sum of all positive integer values of \( n \) is **42**.

The correct answer is **D**.
