Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about contract law, specifically dealing with remedies for a breach of contract. Let me try to think through this step by step.

The question is about a buyer and seller situation. The buyer contracted to buy a used car from the seller for $10,000. On the day of the sale, the buyer offered a $10,000 cashier's check, but the seller refused to take it and didn't deliver the car. Now, the buyer is suing for breach of contract, and we need to determine which remedy they're entitled to.

First, I remember that when a contract is breached, the non-breaching party can seek various remedies. The main ones are specific performance, damages, or sometimes rescission. Since the car is a used item, which is likely a unique good, specific performance might be an option. But I'm not sure yet.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Specific performance. This is when the court orders the seller to actually go through with the sale, delivering the car in exchange for the $10k. But specific performance is usually granted when the item is unique, like real estate. A used car could be considered unique, especially if it's a classic or one-of-a-kind, but I'm not sure if that's the case here.

Option B: Recovery of the cost of the cashier's check. The buyer tendered a cashier's check, so maybe the cost to obtain that? Like, if they paid a fee for the check. But I don't think the question mentions any such cost, so this seems unlikely.

Option C: Recovery of the market price of the car. Hmm, the market price might be different from the contract price. If the market price is higher, the buyer might want the difference, but this would be more like damages based on market price.

Option D: Recovery of the contract price of the car. Wait, the buyer paid $10k, but the seller didn't deliver. So recovery of the contract price doesn't make much sense because the buyer hasn't paid yet. Unless the seller is supposed to return the check, but the seller rejected the tender. So maybe the buyer is trying to get the car, not the money back.

Option E: Reimbursement for transportation costs. Like if the buyer had to rent a car or something. But the question doesn't mention any such costs, so this is probably not applicable.

Option F: Damages measured by the difference between market price and contract price. This sounds familiar. Under the UCC, for breach of a contract for the sale of goods, the buyer can recover the difference between the market price and the contract price, plus any incidental damages. So if the market price is higher, the buyer can get the difference. But if the market price is lower, perhaps the remedy is different. But wait, the UCC applies here because it's a sale of goods (a car is a good).

Option G: Damages for emotional distress. Typically, contract law doesn't allow for emotional distress unless it's a contract where emotional distress was a main part, like a wedding photographer or something. Buying a used car doesn't usually involve that, so this is probably not the right option.

Option H: Punitive damages against the seller. Punitive damages are usually for torts, like when someone's actions are reckless or malicious. In contract law, it's more about compensatory damages unless there's an intentional tort involved, which the question doesn't indicate. So this is unlikely.

Option I: An injunction to prevent the seller from selling to someone else. An injunction is a type of specific performance or a court order to stop an action. In this case, maybe the buyer wants the seller to not sell the car to another buyer. But I'm not sure if an injunction is the standard remedy here; specific performance might be more direct.

Back to the specifics of the case. The buyer tendered the check, which means they were ready and willing to perform. The seller refused. So the contract was breached. Now, what's the appropriate remedy?

Under the UCC, when a seller breaches a contract for the sale of goods, the buyer can choose between several remedies. One is to recover damages under UCC §2-708, which includes the difference between market price and contract price. Alternatively, if the goods are unique, specific performance is an option.

But in this question, the car is used, which might not be unique. Let's say it's a regular used car that can be found elsewhere. Then specific performance wouldn't be granted because the buyer can just buy another similar car. However, if it's a unique vehicle, specific performance might be available.

Assuming it's a regular used car, the buyer would seek damages. The measure would be the difference between the market price at the time and place for tender and the contract price. So option F sounds right.

Wait, but what's the contract price? It's $10k. If the market price is higher than that, the buyer would have to pay more elsewhere, so they can recover the difference. If the market price is lower, the seller might have to pay the buyer the difference if the seller resold it for a lower price, but that's more about the seller's remedies.

In this case, the buyer is the one suing, so they would be looking for damages. So the correct measure is under 2-708(1), which is market price minus contract price. So option F.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option D says recovery of the contract price, but that doesn't make sense because the buyer hasn't paid yet. They tendered the check, but the seller refused. So the buyer might not have lost any money yet. Unless they had to buy another car for a higher price.

Alternatively, if the contract price is $10k, and the market price is higher, say $12k, then the buyer would have to pay $12k elsewhere, so the damages would be $2k. So that aligns with option F.

So the buyer is entitled to the difference between market price and contract price. So the correct answer is F.

Wait, but what about specific performance? If the car is unique, then A would be correct. The question says it's a used car but doesn't specify if it's unique. In contract law exams, when it's a used car, sometimes specific performance is granted if the car has unique characteristics. But without that, the default is market price damages.

So the question is a bit ambiguous. Let me think again. If the car is a regular used car, then specific performance isn't granted. If it's a one-of-a-kind, then A applies. But the question doesn't say it's unique, so the buyer would seek damages under F.

Alternatively, another thought: the buyer tendered the check, meaning they were ready to pay. So maybe the proper remedy is specific performance, forcing the seller to accept the check and hand over the car. That would make sense because the buyer has already tendered payment. So option A could be correct.

Wait, that's a good point. The buyer has already tendered the payment. So the seller has no reason to refuse except for breach. So the buyer might be entitled to specific performance, requiring the seller to deliver the car in exchange for the check.

But I'm a bit confused because typically, specific performance is more common in real estate. For goods, especially used ones, it's not always granted. But if the buyer has the funds and is ready to pay, the court might order specific performance.

So which option is correct between A and F?

The question is about which remedy the buyer is entitled to. So if the car is unique, A applies. If not, F applies.

But the question doesn't specify uniqueness, just that it's a used car. So the default might be that it's not unique, so F is the answer. But I'm not 100% sure.

Alternatively, the fact that the buyer tendered the check might indicate that specific performance is the appropriate remedy because the buyer is ready, willing, and able to perform. So the court would enforce the contract, and the seller must deliver the car.

Wait, but in the UCC, specific performance is available under 2-716 when the goods are unique or when other remedies are inadequate. So if the car is not unique, but the buyer can't easily find another, maybe specific performance is still an option. Or perhaps the buyer's tender of the check makes specific performance appropriate.

I think I might be overcomplicating this. In many bar exam questions, when a buyer tenders the price and the seller refuses, specific performance is the correct remedy if the goods are unique. If not, then damages.

But the question doesn't state the car is unique, so maybe the correct answer is F, the difference in market price.

Wait, but another angle: when the buyer has tendered the payment, the seller's refusal could mean that the buyer is entitled to specific performance. Because the only thing left is the delivery, and the buyer has done their part.

So perhaps the correct answer is A.

Hmm. I'm a bit torn here. Let me try to recall case law or the UCC specifics.

Under UCC §2-709, a seller can sue for the price if the buyer breaches, but here it's the buyer suing the seller. The buyer's remedies are under UCC §2-708 and §2-709.

Wait, under UCC §2-709(1), the seller can recover the price if the buyer has accepted the goods, but that's not the case here.

Wait, no, the buyer is the plaintiff. So looking at UCC §2-708, which is about buyer's remedies.

So, for a buyer, under 2-708(1), the measure of damages is the difference between market price and contract price at the time and place for tender. So that's when the seller has breached by failing to deliver.

So the buyer is entitled to that. So option F.

But then, what about specific performance? 2-716(1) says that specific performance may be granted when the goods are unique or when other remedies are inadequate.

If the car is not unique, then specific performance isn't granted, and the buyer gets damages under 2-708(1), which is option F.

So, the correct answer is F.
</think>

The question revolves around a buyer who contracted to purchase a used car for $10,000 and tendered a $10,000 cashier's check on the agreed-upon date, only for the seller to refuse the tender and fail to deliver the car. The buyer is now suing for breach of contract, and the task is to determine the appropriate remedy.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A: Specific Performance**  
   Specific performance is a remedy where the court orders the seller to deliver the car in exchange for the $10,000. This remedy is typically granted when the goods are unique or when other remedies are inadequate. However, the question does not specify that the car is unique, and since it is a used car, it is likely not unique. Therefore, specific performance is unlikely to be the correct remedy.

2. **Option B: Recovery of the Cost of the Cashier's Check**  
   This option is not relevant because the question does not mention any costs associated with obtaining the cashier's check. The buyer's loss is not related to the cost of the check itself.

3. **Option C: Recovery of the Market Price of the Car**  
   This option is incorrect because the buyer is not seeking to recover the market price directly. Instead, the buyer would seek damages based on the difference between the market price and the contract price, not the market price itself.

4. **Option D: Recovery of the Contract Price of the Car**  
   This option does not make sense in this context because the buyer has not yet paid the contract price. The seller rejected the tender, so the buyer is not seeking reimbursement of a payment already made.

5. **Option E: Reimbursement for Transportation Costs Incurred Due to the Lack of a Car**  
   This option is not applicable because the question does not mention any transportation costs or other incidental expenses incurred by the buyer.

6. **Option F: Damages Measured by the Difference Between the Market Price and the Contract Price for the Car**  
   Under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) §2-708(1), when a seller breaches a contract for the sale of goods, the buyer can recover damages measured by the difference between the market price of the goods at the time and place for tender and the contract price. This is the standard remedy for a breach of contract for the sale of goods when specific performance is not granted. Since the car is not specified as unique, this is the most appropriate remedy.

7. **Option G: Damages for Emotional Distress**  
   Emotional distress damages are not available in this case because contract law does not typically allow for such damages unless the contract explicitly involves emotional well-being, which is not the case here.

8. **Option H: Punitive Damages Against the Seller**  
   Punitive damages are generally reserved for tort claims involving reckless or malicious conduct. This is a breach of contract case, and punitive damages are not applicable.

9. **Option I: An Injunction to Prevent the Seller from Selling the Car to Someone Else**  
   While an injunction could theoretically prevent the seller from selling the car to another buyer, this is not the standard remedy in this situation. Specific performance (if applicable) would be a more direct remedy, but since the car is likely not unique, this option is not the best choice.

### Conclusion:  
The most appropriate remedy for the buyer is damages measured by the difference between the market price and the contract price of the car, as provided under UCC §2-708(1). This makes **Option F** the correct answer.

Answer: F
