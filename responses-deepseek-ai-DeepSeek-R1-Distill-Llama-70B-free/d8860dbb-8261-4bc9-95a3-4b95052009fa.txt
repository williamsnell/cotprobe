Okay, so I've got this question about the equilibrium populations of hydrogen energy levels in a molecule, and how they change after a certain pulse. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question says the equilibrium populations are nα = nαeq and nβ = nβeq. Then, a pulse is applied: 5.0 μs with B1 = 4.697 mT. I need to find what the populations become after this pulse.

Wait, I remember that in NMR, when you apply a radiofrequency pulse, it affects the populations of the spin states. The pulse can cause transitions between the energy levels. At equilibrium, the populations are determined by the Boltzmann distribution. But when a pulse is applied, especially a 90-degree or 180-degree pulse, it can alter these populations.

Wait, B1 is the strength of the radiofrequency field. The duration of the pulse (here, 5.0 μs) multiplied by B1's strength (in appropriate units) determines the flip angle. The flip angle is gamma * B1 * t, where gamma is the gyromagnetic ratio. Oh right, for protons, gamma is about 2.675e8 rad/s/T.

So let me calculate the flip angle. B1 is 4.697 mT, which is 0.004697 T. Time is 5e-6 seconds. So:

Angle θ = gamma * B1 * t = 2.675e8 * 0.004697 * 5e-6.

Let me compute that: 2.675e8 * 0.004697 is approximately 1.257e6. Then multiply by 5e-6: 1.257e6 * 5e-6 = about 6.285 radians.

Wait, how much is that in terms of pi? Pi is about 3.1416, so 6.285 is roughly 2 pi. Because 2 pi is about 6.283. So the flip angle is about 2 pi radians, which is 360 degrees. Oh, wait, but a 360-degree pulse is equivalent to doing nothing because it's a full rotation. So the populations would return to their original state.

Wait, but wait a second. When the flip angle is 180 degrees, it's a complete inversion. But 360 degrees brings it back. So if the flip angle is about 2pi, the effect is the same as no pulse at all. So the populations remain at their equilibrium values.

Looking at the options, option F says nα and nβ remain the same as equilibrium. So the answer should be F.

But wait, let me double-check. The calculation might be off. Let me compute more precisely.

Calculating θ again:

gamma = 2.675e8 rad/(s*T)
B1 = 4.697e-3 T
t = 5e-6 s

θ = 2.675e8 * 4.697e-3 *5e-6

Let me compute 2.675e8 *4.697e-3 = 2.675e8 * 0.004697.

2.675e8 * 0.004697 = (2.675 * 4.697) * 1e5.

Calculating 2.675 *4.697: Hmm, 2.675 *4 is about 10.7, 2.675 *0.697 is roughly 1.86. So total about 12.56. So 12.56 * 1e5 = 1.256e6 rad/s.

Multiply by t=5e-6 s: 1.256e6 *5e-6 = 6.28 rad.

6.28 rad is approximately 2pi, which is 6.28319. So yeah, very close to 2pi. So the rotation is a full circle, bringing the magnetization back to where it started. So the populations don't change.

So the correct answer is F: nα = nαeq, nβ = nβeq.

The question involves determining the populations of the 1H energy levels of a molecule after applying a 5.0 μs pulse with \( B_1 = 4.697 \, \text{mT} \). At equilibrium, the populations are \( n_\alpha = n_\alpha^\text{eq} \) and \( n_\beta = n_\beta^\text{eq} \). When a radiofrequency pulse is applied, the populations can change depending on the flip angle, which is calculated using \( \theta = \gamma B_1 t \), where \( \gamma \) is the gyromagnetic ratio for protons (\( \gamma \approx 2.675 \times 10^8 \, \text{rad/s/T} \)).

1. **Calculate the flip angle**:
   \[
   \theta = \gamma B_1 t = (2.675 \times 10^8) \times (4.697 \times 10^{-3}) \times (5.0 \times 10^{-6})
   \]
   First, compute \( \gamma B_1 \):
   \[
   \gamma B_1 = (2.675 \times 10^8) \times (4.697 \times 10^{-3}) \approx 1.257 \times 10^6 \, \text{rad/s}
   \]
   Then multiply by \( t = 5.0 \, \mu\text{s} = 5.0 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{s} \):
   \[
   \theta = (1.257 \times 10^6) \times (5.0 \times 10^{-6}) \approx 6.285 \, \text{rad}
   \]
   Converting to terms of \( \pi \):
   \[
   \theta \approx 2\pi \, \text{rad} \, (360^\circ)
   \]

2. **Interpret the flip angle**:
   A flip angle of \( 2\pi \, \text{rad} \) corresponds to a full rotation of the magnetization vector, which is equivalent to no net change in the populations. Thus, the populations remain at their equilibrium values:
   \[
   n_\alpha = n_\alpha^\text{eq}, \quad n_\beta = n_\beta^\text{eq}
   \]

3. **Select the correct option**:
   From the given options, the one that matches this result is **F**: \( n_\alpha = n_\alpha^\text{eq} \) and \( n_\beta = n_\beta^\text{eq} \).

Answer: F
