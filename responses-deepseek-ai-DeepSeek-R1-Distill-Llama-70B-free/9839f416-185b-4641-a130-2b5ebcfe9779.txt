E: 0.375 g
F: 0.000625 g
G: 1.00 g
H: 0.1875 g
I: 0.125 g
J: 0.0625 g

Okay, so I've got this question about radioactive decay and half-lives. Hmm, let me try to think through this. I remember that half-life is the time it takes for half of a radioactive substance to decay. So, the key here is the half-life formula, which I think is something like N = N0 * (1/2)^(t / T), where N is the remaining quantity, N0 is the initial quantity, t is the time elapsed, and T is the half-life.

The problem says the sample has a half-life of 1 hour. We start with 1.000 gram at noon, and we need to find out how much remains at 3:00 pm. So, from noon to 3 pm is 3 hours. So, t is 3 hours, and T is 1 hour.

Plugging into the formula: N = 1.000 g * (1/2)^(3/1). That simplifies to (1/2)^3. Wait, (1/2)^3 is 1/8, which is 0.125. But wait, wait. Let me double-check that. Because each half-life reduces it by half. 

Let me break it down step by step. Starting at 1 gram. After 1 hour (1 half-life), it's 0.5 grams. After 2 hours (2 half-lives), it's 0.25 grams. After 3 hours (3 half-lives), it should be 0.125 grams. So that's 1/8th of the original amount. So the answer should be 0.125 grams.

Looking at the options, option I is 0.125 g. So the correct answer is I.

The problem involves calculating the remaining amount of a radioactive sample after a certain time using the half-life formula. The half-life formula is:

\[
N = N_0 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\frac{t}{T}}
\]

Here:
- \( N_0 = 1.000 \, \text{g} \) (initial amount),
- \( T = 1 \, \text{hour} \) (half-life),
- \( t = 3 \, \text{hours} \) (elapsed time).

Substituting the values:

\[
N = 1.000 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\frac{3}{1}} = 1.000 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = 1.000 \cdot \frac{1}{8} = 0.125 \, \text{g}.
\]

Thus, the remaining amount of the sample at 3:00 pm is **0.125 grams**, which corresponds to option I.

Answer: I
