Question:

TYPE II ERROR is the failure to reject a false null hypothesis. The Power is the probability of NOT making a Type II error and is effected by several factors. Which factor out of the following ones that have influence on the power is incorrectly defined?

Options:

A: Variability→ power decreases as variability increases
B: as differences between populations means increase, power increases
C: Sample Size→ power decreases with sample size increase
D: Confidence level→ power decreases as confidence level increases
E: 1-tailed tests have higher power
F: Alpha→ power increases as alpha level increases
G: Population size→ power decreases as population size increases

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about Type II errors and the power of a statistical test. I'm a bit rusty on my statistics, but let me try to think this through step by step.

The question is asking which factor is incorrectly defined in terms of its influence on the power of a test. Power is the probability of not making a Type II error, which means correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis. So higher power is better because it means the test is more likely to detect an effect if it exists.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Variability→ power decreases as variability increases. Hmm, I remember that higher variability makes it harder to detect differences because there's more noise. So yes, if variability (like standard deviation) increases, the power should decrease. That makes sense because with more variability, the effect is harder to spot. So A is correct.

Option B: As differences between population means increase, power increases. That seems right too. A bigger effect size makes it easier to detect, so power goes up. So B is correct.

Option C: Sample Size→ power decreases with sample size increase. Wait, that doesn't sound right. I thought that larger sample sizes increase power. Because with more data, you have more precise estimates, making it easier to detect an effect. So if C says power decreases when sample size increases, that's incorrect. So C might be the wrong one.

Option D: Confidence level→ power decreases as confidence level increases. Confidence level is related to the alpha level, right? Like a 95% confidence level corresponds to alpha=0.05. If confidence level increases (say from 95% to 99%), that means alpha decreases (from 0.05 to 0.01). A lower alpha makes it harder to reject the null, so power would decrease. So D is correct.

Option E: 1-tailed tests have higher power. I think this is true. One-tailed tests focus the alpha in one direction, so they're more powerful than two-tailed tests when the effect is in the predicted direction. So E is correct.

Option F: Alpha→ power increases as alpha level increases. Yes, because a higher alpha (like 0.05 to 0.10) means a lower threshold for rejecting the null. So it's easier to reject, which increases power. So F is correct.

Option G: Population size→ power decreases as population size increases. Wait, population size versus sample size? I think power is more affected by sample size, the number of observations you take. The population size is the total from which you're sampling. If the population is huge, but your sample is small, the population size doesn't directly affect power much. So I'm not sure about G. But the option says power decreases when population size increases. I'm not certain if that's correct. Maybe it's a distractor.

Wait, the question is which option is incorrect. So looking back, option C says power decreases as sample size increases, which is the opposite of what's true. So C is incorrect, so the answer would be C.

The question asks which factor is incorrectly defined regarding its influence on the power of a statistical test. Power is the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis, and it is influenced by several factors. Here's an analysis of each option:

- **Option A**: Correct. As variability increases, it becomes harder to detect differences, so power decreases.
- **Option B**: Correct. Larger differences between population means make it easier to detect effects, increasing power.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. Power increases with sample size, as larger samples provide more precise estimates. This option states the opposite, making it the incorrect definition.
- **Option D**: Correct. A higher confidence level corresponds to a lower alpha, making it harder to reject the null hypothesis and decreasing power.
- **Option E**: Correct. One-tailed tests are more powerful than two-tailed tests when the effect direction is known.
- **Option F**: Correct. A higher alpha increases the likelihood of rejecting the null hypothesis, thereby increasing power.
- **Option G**: Likely incorrect, but less directly relevant. Power is more influenced by sample size than population size, but the statement itself is not inherently wrong.

The incorrect definition is **Option C**, as it falsely claims that power decreases with increasing sample size, whereas power actually increases. 

Answer: C
