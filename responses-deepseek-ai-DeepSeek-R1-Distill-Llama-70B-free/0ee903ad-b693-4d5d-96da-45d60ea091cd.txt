Okay, so I need to solve this problem about the plumber's pay. Let me read the question again carefully.

The plumber is paid $4.50 per hour for up to 40 hours. And for any time beyond 40 hours, he gets 1 and 3/4 times his regular pay. The question is asking what his pay would be for a 50-hour work week.

Hmm, right. So first, I'll break it down. For the first 40 hours, it's straightforwardâ€”$4.50 each hour. Then, the remaining 10 hours (since 50-40=10) are considered overtime. Overtime pay is 1.75 times the regular rate.

Wait, let me make sure. 1 and 3/4 is the same as 1.75, right? Because 3/4 is 0.75. So yeah, 1.75 times the regular pay for overtime.

So first, calculate the regular pay. 40 hours * $4.50 per hour. Let me do that math. 40 * 4.50... Well, 4 times 40 is 160, and 0.50 times 40 is 20, so 160+20 = $180.00.

Okay, that's the regular part. Now for the overtime. He worked 10 extra hours. So each of those hours is 1.75 * $4.50. Let me calculate that. 4.50 * 1.75.

Hmm, 4 * 1.75 is 7, and 0.50 * 1.75 is 0.875. So adding those gives 7 + 0.875 = 7.875. So each overtime hour is $7.875.

Wait, maybe I should compute 4.50 * 1.75 more accurately. Let me think: 4.50 is the same as 4 and a half, so 4.5 * 1.75. 

Alternatively, 4.50 * 1.75 is the same as (4.50 * 1) + (4.50 * 0.75). So 4.50 + 3.375 = 7.875. Yes, that's correct.

So each overtime hour is $7.875. For 10 hours, that's 10 * 7.875. Let me compute that. 10 * 7 is 70, and 10 * 0.875 is 8.75. So 70 + 8.75 = 78.75.

So the overtime pay is $78.75.

Now, the total pay is the sum of regular and overtime. So $180 + $78.75 = $258.75.

Wait, let me double-check the addition. 180 plus 78.75. 180 + 70 is 250, then add 8.75, which gives 258.75.

Looking at the options, the closest one is option D: $258.80. Hmm, but wait, my calculation gives $258.75, not 258.80. So maybe I made a mistake in the calculations.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the overtime pay more accurately. Let me recalculate 4.50 * 1.75.

4.50 multiplied by 1.75. Let me compute 4 * 1.75, which is 7. Then 0.5 * 1.75 is 0.875. So 7 + 0.875 is indeed 7.875. So that's correct.

So 10 hours at 7.875 gives 78.75. Adding to 180 gives 258.75. Hmm, but the options don't have 258.75. Option D is 258.80, which is 5 cents more. Did I miscalculate something?

Wait, perhaps the overtime rate is calculated differently. Let me read the question again. It says 1(3/4) time. Oh wait, maybe it's 1 and 3/4 times, which is 1.75 times. Or perhaps, in some contexts, "time and a half" is 1.5 times. Wait, no. Time and a half is 1.5. Time and three quarters is 1.75.

Wait, maybe I should compute the total pay again.

Regular pay: 40 * 4.50 = 180. Overtime: 10 * (4.50 * 1.75) = 10 * 7.875 = 78.75. Total: 180 +78.75=258.75.

So the exact total is $258.75, but the options don't have that. The closest option is D: $258.80. Hmm, perhaps there's a rounding involved. Or maybe I messed up the initial calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps the overtime rate is 4.50 multiplied by 1.75 exactly, and then multiplied by 10. Let me compute 4.50 * 1.75 in another way.

4.50 * 1.75. 1.75 is 7/4, so 4.50 * 7/4. 4.50 is 9/2, so 9/2 *7/4=63/8. 63 divided by 8 is 7.875. So that's correct.

Wait, but 63/8 is 7.875. So no mistake there.

Wait, perhaps the initial pay is $4.50 per hour, but when calculating the overtime, it's actually 4.50 * 1.75. So perhaps the problem is that I'm missing a decimal somewhere.

Wait, maybe I should approach it differently. Let me compute the total pay as follows:

First 40 hours: 40 *4.50= 180.

Overtime hours: 10 * (4.50 * 1.75) = 10 *7.875=78.75.

Total pay: 180 +78.75=258.75.

But none of the options exactly match 258.75. The options are:

A: 238.80

B:218.80

C:208.80

D:258.80

E:248.80

F:278.80

G:298.80

H:225.00

I:268.80

J:288.80

So the closest is D:258.80, which is 5 cents higher than my calculation. Maybe the question rounds to the nearest cent, but 258.75 would round to 258.75, not 258.80. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the overtime rate.

Wait, another possibility: Perhaps the overtime is computed as 1.5 times, but the question says 1(3/4), which is 1.75. So that can't be it.

Wait, perhaps the initial pay is $4.50, but in the overtime calculation, maybe it's 4.50 * 1.75.

Wait, 4.50 * 1.75 is 7.875. So 10 hours at 7.875 is 78.75. So 180 +78.75=258.75. So perhaps the option D is 258.80, which is 0.05 more.

Hmm, maybe the options have a typo. Alternatively, perhaps I should check if I'm considering the correct number of hours. Wait, the total hours are 50. So 40 regular, 10 overtime. That's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the overtime rate is calculated differently. Wait, perhaps the overtime pay is 1.75 times the regular pay. So 10 hours * (4.50 * 1.75) = 78.75. So that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the original pay is $4.50 per hour, so the overtime is 4.50 * 1.75=7.875, and 10 hours of that is 78.75. So total is 180 +78.75=258.75, which is 258.75.

Looking at the options, D is 258.80. That's the closest. So perhaps the answer is D.

Wait, but why is there a 0.05 difference? Maybe I made a calculation error somewhere. Let me recompute 4.50 *1.75.

4.50 *1.75:

Breakdown:

1.75 is 1 + 0.75.

4.50 *1=4.50.

4.50 *0.75=3.375.

Adding them gives 4.50 +3.375=7.875.

Yes, that's correct.

So 10 *7.875=78.75.

So total is 180 +78.75=258.75.

Hmm, perhaps the options rounded to the nearest cent, but 258.75 is already exact. Alternatively, perhaps I read the question wrong.

Wait, let me read the question again. It says 1(3/4) time for work in excess of 40 hours. So 1.75 times the regular rate. So correct.

Wait, perhaps I should check the options again. Is there an option that's 258.75? Looking back:

Options are A to J, with D being 258.80. So no, no option is exactly 258.75. So the closest is option D, 258.80.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects us to calculate the regular 40 hours at 4.50, and the overtime at 4.50 * 1.75. But wait, perhaps the 4.50 is in dollars, but maybe it's $4.5 per hour, and the overtime is 1.75 times that. So perhaps I didn't make a mistake, but the options have a typo.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check the calculation again. Let me compute 40 *4.50 again.

40 *4.50: 4.50 *40= 180.00. Correct.

Overtime: 10 * (4.50 *1.75) =10 *7.875=78.75.

Total: 180 +78.75=258.75.

So the correct answer should be 258.75, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is option D:258.80.

Alternatively, maybe the initial pay is $4.50, but in the overtime calculation, it's 4.50 * 1.75. Wait, that's what I did.

Wait, perhaps the question is using 1 and 3/4 times the total weekly pay? No, that wouldn't make sense. Or perhaps it's 1.75 times the regular rate, which is what I did.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using 1.5 times instead of 1.75. Let me see what that would give.

If overtime was 1.5 times, 4.50 *1.5=6.75 per hour. 10 hours would be 67.50. Total pay would be 180 +67.50=247.50, which is option E:248.80 minus some. So that's not matching.

So no, the overtime rate is definitely 1.75 times.

Hmm. So perhaps the options are just off by a nickel. Maybe the correct answer isn't present, but the closest is D.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me try another approach.

Calculate the total pay:

Regular hours: 40 *4.50 = 180.

Overtime hours:10 * (4.50 * 1.75) =10 *7.875=78.75.

Total pay: 180 +78.75=258.75.

So the exact amount is $258.75, which isn't an option, but option D is $258.80. So perhaps the intended answer is D, possibly due to rounding.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the overtime rate to be 1.5 times. Let me check that scenario again. If overtime is 1.5 times, then:

Overtime pay per hour:4.50 *1.5=6.75.

10 hours:67.50.

Total pay:180 +67.50=247.50. Hmm, that's not matching any option except perhaps E:248.80, but that's higher.

No, that can't be right because the question clearly states 1 and 3/4 time.

Wait, maybe I should compute the total pay without breaking it into regular and overtime.

Wait, 40 hours at 4.50 is 180.

10 hours at 7.875 is 78.75.

180 +78.75=258.75.

So total pay is $258.75. Since the options don't have this, perhaps the answer intended is option D:258.80.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check if there's a miscalculation in the number of overtime hours. Wait, the total hours are 50, so 50-40=10. So 10 is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem states that the rate is 1.75 times the regular rate, but perhaps it's 1.75 times the total, which doesn't make sense. Or perhaps it's a different interpretation.

Wait, perhaps the problem says that the plumber is paid $4.50 per hour for up to 40 hours, and 1.75 times that for any time beyond 40. So that's what I did.

Hmm, perhaps the answer is D:258.80, as it's the closest, even though my calculation gives 258.75.

Wait, perhaps the initial 40 hours are calculated as 4.50 each, but in some places, when overtime is involved, the overtime rate is (hourly rate * 1.75). So that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe the calculation is done as:

Total pay = (40 *4.50) + (10 *4.50 * 1.75).

Which is 180 + (10 *7.875) = 180 +78.75=258.75.

So perhaps the options have a typo, and the intended answer is D:258.80.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that the plumber's pay is computed with cents correctly, but I think my calculation is correct.

So, given the options, the closest match is D:258.80.
</think>

The plumber is paid $4.50 per hour for the first 40 hours and 1.75 times the regular rate ($4.50) for any hours worked beyond 40. For a 50-hour workweek:

1. **Regular pay**:  
   For the first 40 hours:  
   \[
   40 \, \text{hours} \times 4.50 \, \text{\$/hour} = 180.00 \, \text{\$}
   \]

2. **Overtime pay**:  
   For the remaining 10 hours:  
   \[
   \text{Overtime rate} = 4.50 \times 1.75 = 7.875 \, \text{\$/hour}
   \]  
   \[
   10 \, \text{hours} \times 7.875 \, \text{\$/hour} = 78.75 \, \text{\$}
   \]

3. **Total pay**:  
   \[
   180.00 + 78.75 = 258.75 \, \text{\$}
   \]

The calculated total pay is $258.75. However, the closest option provided is **$258.80**. This small discrepancy (5 cents) may be due to rounding in the options. Based on the given choices, the best match is:

**D: $258.80**
