Question:

A healthy 22-year-old man participates in a study of glucose metabolism. At the beginning of the study, his serum glucose concentration is within the reference range. He consumes an 800-calorie meal consisting of protein, fat, and carbohydrates. He then sleeps through the night without additional food or drink. Twelve hours later, his serum glucose concentration remains within the reference range. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely involved in maintaining this man's serum glucose concentration?

Options:

A: Increased glucose uptake by the brain
B: Continued gut absorption of calories from the ingested meal
C: Increased glucose uptake by red blood cells
D: Glucose release from skeletal muscle
E: Glycogenolysis in the liver
F: Increased leptin release from adipose tissues
G: Enhanced gluconeogenesis in the kidney
H: Elevated insulin secretion from the pancreas

Okay, so I've got this question here about glucose metabolism, and I'm a bit new to this topic, but I'll try to think it through.

So the scenario is a healthy 22-year-old man. He participates in a study where his serum glucose is normal at the start. Then he eats an 800-calorie meal with protein, fat, and carbs. He sleeps through the night without eating or drinking anything else. Twelve hours later, his glucose is still within the reference range. The question is asking which mechanism is maintaining his serum glucose.

Hmm, I remember that after eating, blood glucose goes up, and then insulin is released to lower it. But this is after 12 hours, so the meal has been digested already. So the body must be managing glucose without the meal's immediate effects.

Wait, after eating, the body stores excess glucose as glycogen in the liver and muscles. But glycogen can only hold so much. Since it's 12 hours later, maybe glycogen is being broken down? Glycogenolysis is the breakdown of glycogen into glucose, right? So the liver would release glucose into the bloodstream.

But wait, what about the state of the body after 12 hours? He hasn't eaten, so he's in a fasting state. So the body would need to maintain blood glucose levels. In the early fasting phase, the liver's glycogen is broken down. That's glycogenolysis. Once glycogen stores are depleted, the body starts making glucose from other sources, like amino acids, lactate, etc., which is gluconeogenesis.

So the key here is the timing. How long can glycogen stores last? I think the liver's glycogen usually lasts about 12-18 hours during fasting. So after 12 hours, maybe the glycogen is still being broken down, so glycogenolysis is active.

Looking at the options, option E is glycogenolysis in the liver. That sounds relevant. Other options: option G is gluconeogenesis in the kidney. Wait, gluconeogenesis occurs mainly in the liver and kidneys, but during fasting, the liver does most of it, I think. Or wait, maybe the kidney contributes more during prolonged fasting.

But the question is about a 12-hour fast, which I think is still within the time frame where glycogen is being used. So the liver is breaking down glycogen, releasing glucose, which keeps the blood levels normal.

Other options: option B says continued gut absorption. But 12 hours after a meal, the stomach would be empty, right? So no calories are being absorbed anymore. So B is probably not correct.

Option A: increased glucose uptake by the brain. The brain does use glucose, but it's a constant process. I don't think it's the main mechanism for maintaining serum glucose during fasting. Plus, the brain would take glucose from the blood, which would lower it, so the body would need to produce more glucose. So that's not maintaining the level; it's using it, so the body has to compensate.

Option C: glucose uptake by red blood cells. Red blood cells use glucose, but again, that's a steady process. It doesn't explain how the glucose levels are maintained, because the body would need to replenish it.

Option D: glucose release from skeletal muscle. Wait, muscles store glycogen too, but they don't release it into the bloodstream. The muscle glycogen is for the muscle's own use. So D is incorrect.

Option F: increased leptin. Leptin is involved in energy balance, but I'm not sure how directly it affects acute glucose levels. Maybe more related to long-term regulation.

Option H: elevated insulin. No, during fasting, insulin levels are low. Insulin is released after eating. So after 12 hours, insulin would be low, not elevated.

So putting it together, the main mechanism here is the liver breaking down glycogen, which is glycogenolysis. So option E.
</think>

To maintain serum glucose concentration during a 12-hour fast following a meal, the body relies on mechanisms that regulate blood glucose levels in the absence of food intake. After consuming a meal, glucose is absorbed and stored as glycogen in the liver and muscles. During fasting, the liver breaks down glycogen into glucose through a process called glycogenolysis, releasing it into the bloodstream to maintain normal glucose levels.

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Increased glucose uptake by the brain**  
  The brain continuously uses glucose, but this process does not maintain serum glucose levels; it consumes glucose, requiring the body to produce more.

- **B: Continued gut absorption of calories from the ingested meal**  
  After 12 hours, the meal has already been digested and absorbed, so this is not relevant.

- **C: Increased glucose uptake by red blood cells**  
  Red blood cells steadily use glucose, but this does not explain how glucose levels are maintained during fasting.

- **D: Glucose release from skeletal muscle**  
  Skeletal muscle stores glycogen for its own use and does not release glucose into the bloodstream.

- **E: Glycogenolysis in the liver**  
  This is the correct mechanism. The liver breaks down glycogen into glucose during fasting to maintain blood glucose levels.

- **F: Increased leptin release from adipose tissues**  
  Leptin is involved in long-term energy balance, not acute glucose regulation.

- **G: Enhanced gluconeogenesis in the kidney**  
  While gluconeogenesis occurs during prolonged fasting, it is not the primary mechanism at 12 hours, when glycogenolysis is still active.

- **H: Elevated insulin secretion from the pancreas**  
  Insulin levels are low during fasting, as insulin is released postprandially.

The most likely mechanism maintaining serum glucose concentration after 12 hours of fasting is glycogenolysis in the liver.
