Okay, so I've got this accounting problem here about the dollar-value LIFO method. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can figure it out.

So, the problem says that Cool Hand Luke Corporation uses the dollar-value LIFO method and the base year is 1969. They've provided the ending inventory for each year from 1969 to 1974 and the corresponding price-level indices. The task is to change the 1974 ending inventory from current cost to dollar-value LIFO cost.

Wait, I remember that dollar-value LIFO is a method used to value inventory by adjusting for price level changes, right? It's a way to account for inflation, I think. So each year, you figure out if the inventory is higher or lower in real terms, adjusting for inflation, and then convert it into base year dollars.

The base year here is 1969, with a price index of 100%. So for each subsequent year, the price index changes, and we have to adjust the inventory accordingly.

Let me list out the data to make it clearer.

Year       Ending Inventory    Price-Level Index
1969       $16,400             100%
1970       $16,200             96%
1971       $20,900             104%
1972       $26,400             110%
1973       $24,035             115%
1974       $26,568             108%

So we need to compute the dollar-value LIFO inventory for each year, starting from 1969, and then find the 1974 value.

I think the process is similar to how LIFO works, but in layers. Each year, we determine if the inventory is higher than the previous year when adjusted for inflation. If it is, we add a new layer. If not, we might be reducing previous layers.

Wait, the formula I remember is to take the current ending inventory and divide it by the current year's price index to get it in base year dollars. Then compare it to the previous year's base dollar inventory. If it's higher, the difference is a new layer. If it's lower, you might be invading previous layers.

Let me think step by step for each year.

Starting with 1969, since it's the base year, the dollar-value LIFO inventory is the same as the current cost, which is $16,400.

1970: Current inventory is $16,200. The price index is 96. So to convert to base year terms, it's 16,200 / (96/100) = 16,200 / 0.96. Let me compute that. 16,200 divided by 0.96. Hmm, 16,200 * (1/0.96) = 16,200 * 1.041666... So that's approximately 16,875. But wait, let me compute it accurately: 0.96 is 24/25, so 16,200 * (25/24)= (16,200 /24)*25. 16,200 /24 is 675. 675 *25 = 16,875. So $16,875 in base terms.

But the previous base layer was 16,400. So 16,875 is higher than 16,400. So that means in 1970, the inventory increased by 475 (16,875 -16,400). So the 1970 dollar-value LIFO would be 16,400 (base) + 475 (new layer) = $16,875. Wait, but wait, I think that the layers are in base year dollars, and then when converting back, they're valued at the current index. Hmm, maybe I got that wrong.

Wait, no, in dollar-value LIFO, each layer is converted to current dollars when the financial statements are prepared. But for the purpose of calculating whether a new layer is added, you use base year dollars.

So the approach is:

1. For each year after the base, convert the current inventory to base year dollars by dividing by (current price index / base price index).

2. Compare this base dollar amount to the previous year's total base dollar inventory.

3. If it's higher, the difference is a new layer at current prices (so multiplied by the current price index).

Wait, maybe I should approach it like this: Each year, the inventory in base dollars is computed as current inventory / (current index / base index). Then, if this base dollar amount is higher than the prior year's, the increase is a new layer, calculated as (current base amount - prior base amount) * current index.

Wait, no, I think I'm getting confused. Let me try to structure it properly.

The base is 1969, index 100. So the initial layer is 16,400 in 1969.

1970: Current inventory is 16,200, index 96.

Convert current inventory to base dollars: 16,200 / (96/100) = 16,200 / 0.96 = 16,875.

Compare to previous base layer (16,400). Since 16,875 >16,400, there's an increase of 475 in base dollars. So this 475 is a new layer, and in 1970 dollars, it's 475 * (96/100) = 475 *0.96=456. So the 1970 dollar-value LIFO inventory would be 16,400 (base layer) + 456 (new layer)=16,856? Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Because in LIFO, you'd value each layer at the price index of the year it was added.

Wait, perhaps I should think of each layer's value in current dollars. So the 1969 layer is 16,400 at 100 index. The 1970 layer is 475 (base) converted to 1970 dollars, which is 475 * (96/100)= 456. So the total 1970 LIFO inventory is 16,400 + 456=16,856. But wait, the current ending inventory is 16,200, which is less than 16,856. That can't be right because LIFO can't be higher than current.

Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Wait, no, because dollar-value LIFO adjusts for inflation, but the actual current inventory could be lower or higher. Maybe I'm not getting this right.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The formula I remember is that each year, you compute the inventory in base dollars and compare it to the previous year's base total.

So, for each year:

Base Inventory = Current Inventory / (Current Index / Base Index)

If Base Inventory > Previous Base Inventory, then the difference is a new layer, which is added in current dollars.

Wait, but when you add the new layer, it's based on the current index. So the new layer in base is (Current Base - Previous Base), which is multiplied by current index to get the dollar amount.

Let me try again for 1970.

1970 Base Inventory = 16,200 / (96/100) = 16,875.

Previous Base Inventory (1969) was 16,400.

Since 16,875 >16,400, the new layer is 475 in base terms. To get the dollar amount for this layer, multiply by the current index (96) divided by base index (100). So 475 * (96/100) = 456.

So the 1970 dollar-value LIFO inventory is the previous LIFO (16,400) plus this new layer (456), totaling 16,856.

But wait, the current inventory is 16,200, which is less than 16,856. That doesn't make sense because the LIFO method should not result in a value higher than the current cost. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the layers are valued at the price index of the year they were added. So each layer is computed as (change in base inventory) * (price index of that year). So for 1970, the layer is 475 *96/100=456. So LIFO inventory at end of 1970 would be 16,400 +456=16,856. But the current inventory is 16,200, which is lower than 16,856. That can't be right because the LIFO value can't be higher than the current inventory.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me think again. Oh wait, no, because the LIFO value is based on the layers added each year. So the total LIFO inventory is the sum of all layers, each valued at the price index of the year they were added.

But in 1970, the LIFO inventory would be 16,400 (from 1969) plus 456 (from 1970) =16,856. But the current cost is 16,200, which is lower. That would imply that the LIFO inventory is higher than the current value, which is possible, but I'm not sure if that makes sense in this context.

Wait, perhaps that's correct. Because in LIFO, when prices are falling, the inventory value would be higher than current cost because older, higher-priced layers are still included.

But let's proceed and see what happens in the following years.

1971:

Current inventory is 20,900. Price index is 104.

Compute base inventory: 20,900 / (104/100) =20,900 /1.04=20,096.15 (approximately). Wait, more accurately, 20,900 ÷ 1.04. Let me compute that: 20,900 /1.04 = 20,096.15.

Compare to previous base inventory (16,875 from 1970). So 20,096.15 >16,875, so the new layer is 20,096.15 -16,875=3,221.15 in base terms.

Multiply this by the 1971 price index (104) to get the dollar value of the new layer: 3,221.15 * (104/100)=3,221.15 *1.04=3,350.00 (approximately). Let me compute it accurately.

3,221.15 *1.04 = ?

3,221.15 *1 =3,221.15

3,221.15 *0.04= 128.846

Total=3,221.15 +128.846=3,350 (exactly, so maybe 3,221.15 *1.04=3,350.00). So the new layer is $3,350.

So the total LIFO inventory at end of 1971 is 16,856 (from 1970) +3,350=20,206. But wait, wait, no. Because each layer is added in the dollar of their respective years, so the 1971 LIFO would be the sum of the previous LIFO layers plus the new layer. Alternatively, each year's LIFO is the previous year's LIFO plus any new layers added that year.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the total base inventory each year and then apply the price index.

Wait, maybe another approach: the dollar-value LIFO inventory is computed as the sum of the base inventory layers, each multiplied by their respective price indices.

So, for each year, the base inventory is the current inventory in base dollars, which is current inventory divided by (current index / base index).

Then, the dollar-value LIFO is the sum of all layers, each layer being the increase in base inventory times the price index of the year the layer was added.

So, let's try to compute this step by step.

Year 1969:

Base Inventory =16,400 / (100/100)=16,400.

LIFO layers: 16,400 (1969 layer).

Total LIFO inventory:16,400.

Year 1970:

Current Inventory=16,200.

Base Inventory=16,200 / (96/100)=16,875.

Compare to previous base (16,400). Increase of 475.

So, new layer=475*(96/100)=456.

Total LIFO inventory=16,400 +456=16,856.

Year 1971:

Current Inventory=20,900.

Base Inventory=20,900 / (104/100)=20,096.15.

Compare to previous base (16,875). Increase of 3,221.15.

New layer=3,221.15*(104/100)=3,350.

Total LIFO=16,856 +3,350=20,206.

Wait, but the current inventory is 20,900, which is higher than 20,206. So that makes sense because LIFO would have layers valued at older, higher prices. But wait, no, in 1971, the price index is 104, which is higher than base year, so older layers are at lower indices. Hmm, maybe not. Let me think.

Wait, no, in 1969, the index is 100. 1971 is 104. So the 1971 layer is added at 104, which is higher than base. So when you add it, it's more valuable. So the total LIFO in 1971 is 16,400 (from 1969) +456 (1970) +3,350 (1971) =20,206.

Wait, but the current inventory is 20,900, which is higher than 20,206. That can't be right because the LIFO method usually values inventory at older costs, which could be lower or higher depending on inflation. But when using dollar-value LIFO, each layer is converted to current dollars using the year's index.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me proceed to year 1972.

Year 1972:

Current Inventory=26,400.

Price index=110.

Base Inventory=26,400 / (110/100)=26,400 /1.10=23,981.82.

Previous base inventory was 20,096.15. So increase is 23,981.82 -20,096.15=3,885.67.

New layer=3,885.67 * (110/100)=4,274.27.

So total LIFO=20,206 +4,274.27=24,480.27.

But the current inventory is 26,400, which is higher than 24,480.27, so that seems possible.

Year 1973:

Current Inventory=24,035.

Price index=115.

Base Inventory=24,035 / (115/100)=24,035 /1.15=20,912.17.

Previous base inventory was 23,981.82. So 20,912.17 is lower than 23,981.82. So there's a decrease, meaning we have to reduce previous layers.

The decrease is 23,981.82 -20,912.17=3,069.65 in base terms.

So this would invade the previous layers, starting from the most recent.

The last layer added was in 1972: 3,885.67 in base terms, which is now reduced by 3,069.65.

So the remaining layer after reduction is 3,885.67 -3,069.65=816.02.

So the total base inventory now is 20,912.17.

Wait, no, the base inventory is 20,912.17, which is the same as the previous total base minus the decrease.

So the total LIFO would be the previous total LIFO (24,480.27) minus the decrease in current dollars. The decrease is 3,069.65 in base terms, so in 1973 dollars, it's 3,069.65 * (115/100)=3,530.09.

So LIFO inventory at end of 1973 is 24,480.27 -3,530.09≈20,950.18.

But wait, the current inventory is 24,035, which is lower than 20,950.18. That can't be right because the LIFO value should not exceed the current inventory. I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I should approach it differently. The LIFO inventory can't be higher than the current inventory. So maybe when the base inventory decreases, we reduce the layers starting from the most recent, but not below zero.

So, let's recalculate.

In 1973, the base inventory is 20,912.17, which is less than the previous base of 23,981.82. So the decrease is 3,069.65 in base terms.

We need to subtract this from the most recent layers. The layers are:

1969:16,400

1970:456

1971:3,350

1972:4,274.27

Total layers before 1973:16,400 +456=16,856; +3,350=20,206; +4,274.27=24,480.27.

So in 1973, the base inventory is 20,912.17, which is 24,480.27 (previous total) - 3,069.65 (decrease) =20,912.17.

Wait, no, that's not accurate. The total base inventory after 1973 is 20,912.17, so the layers in base terms must sum to that.

So the previous layers in base terms were:

1969:16,400

1970:475

1971:3,221.15

1972:3,885.67

Total:16,400 +475=16,875; +3,221.15=20,096.15; +3,885.67=23,981.82.

So the new base is 20,912.17, which is 23,981.82 -3,069.65=20,912.17.

So we have to reduce the layers by 3,069.65 in base terms, starting from the most recent.

The 1972 layer is 3,885.67. We subtract 3,069.65 from it, leaving 3,885.67 -3,069.65=816.02.

So now, the layers in base terms are:

1969:16,400

1970:475

1971:3,221.15

1972:816.02

Total:16,400 +475=16,875; +3,221.15=20,096.15; +816.02=20,912.17.

Now, to find the LIFO inventory in current (1973) dollars, each layer is multiplied by the 1973 index (115).

So:

1969 layer:16,400 * (115/100)=16,400 *1.15=18,860.

1970 layer:475 * (96/100)=456 (as before, but wait, no, each layer is multiplied by their respective year's index).

Wait, no, I think I made a mistake. Each layer is multiplied by the price index of the year it was added. So:

1969 layer:16,400 * (100/100)=16,400.

1970 layer:475 * (96/100)=456.

1971 layer:3,221.15 *
