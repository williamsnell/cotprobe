Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with sound waves and all that. But let's try to work through it step by step.

The question is about finding the frequency of a 2-cm sound wave in seawater. They've given the velocity of sound in seawater as 1.53 × 10^5 cm/s. Hmm, I remember that frequency and wavelength are related through the velocity of the wave. Oh right, the formula is v = λ * f, where v is velocity, λ is wavelength, and f is frequency. So I need to find f, which means rearranging the formula to f = v / λ.

Wait, let me make sure I get the units right. The velocity is given in cm per second, and the wavelength is in cm. Oh, right, that's convenient because when I divide cm/s by cm, the centimeters cancel out, leaving 1/s, which is hertz (Hz). So the units should work out.

So the wavelength λ is 2 cm, and v is 1.53e5 cm/s. Plugging that into the equation: f = (1.53e5 cm/s) / (2 cm). Let's compute that. 1.53e5 divided by 2 is... well, 1.53 times 10^5 divided by 2 is 0.765 × 10^5. Because 1.53 / 2 is 0.765. So that's 7.65e4 Hz.

Wait, 7.65e4 Hz is the same as 76,500 Hz. Oh, but looking at the options, let me check. The options are A: 3.06 kHz, B:7.6 kHz, C:30.6, D:76, E:152, and so on. Wait, 76,500 Hz is 76.5 kHz, right? Because 1 kHz is 1000 Hz. So 76,500 Hz is 76.5 kHz. Looking at the options, option D is 76 kHz, which is very close. So that must be the answer.

Wait, but wait another second. Let me double-check my calculations. 1.53e5 is 153,000 cm/s. Dividing by 2 cm gives 153,000 / 2 = 76,500 Hz. Yep, that's right. So the frequency is 76.5 kHz, which is approximately 76 kHz when rounded, so option D.

I think that's correct. I don't see any mistakes in the steps. Another way to think about it: velocity is 153,000 cm/s, which is the same as 153 km/s, but wait no—no, wait, 1 cm is 0.01 meters, so 1.53e5 cm/s is 1.53e3 meters per second, because 1e2 cm = 1 m. Wait, 1.53e5 cm/s equals 1.53e5 * 0.01 m/s, which is 1.53e3 m/s. Oh, but that's not needed here because the units are compatible as they are. So I think I'm confident that D is the correct answer.

To determine the frequency of a 2-cm sound wave in seawater, we use the relationship between velocity, wavelength, and frequency: 

\[
v = \lambda \cdot f \quad \Rightarrow \quad f = \frac{v}{\lambda}
\]

Here, the velocity of sound in seawater is given as \( v = 1.53 \times 10^5 \, \text{cm/s} \), and the wavelength is \( \lambda = 2 \, \text{cm} \). Substituting these values:

\[
f = \frac{1.53 \times 10^5}{2} = 7.65 \times 10^4 \, \text{Hz}
\]

Converting to kilohertz (\( 1 \, \text{kHz} = 10^3 \, \text{Hz} \)):

\[
f = 76.5 \, \text{kHz}
\]

Among the provided options, the closest value is \( 76 \, \text{kHz} \), which corresponds to option D.

Answer: D
