Okay, so I've got this question about bankruptcy, and I'm trying to figure out how much Mr. Johnson can expect to get from Mr. Williams. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, from what I remember, when someone files for bankruptcy, their assets are used to pay off their creditors. But the exact process depends on the type of bankruptcy. Wait, the question doesn't specify which chapter, but I think for this problem, it's probably a straightforward liquidation scenario, maybe like Chapter 7, where assets are sold to pay creditors.

So Mr. Williams has assets totaling $2,240 and liabilities (debts) of $5,600. That means there's more debt than assets, so the creditors won't get the full amount they're owed. They'll have to share proportionally from what's available.

Mr. Johnson has a claim of $1,725. So first, I need to find out the total amount available for distribution, which is $2,240. Then, I should calculate what percentage or fraction of the total liabilities each creditor gets.

Wait, let's see. The total liabilities are $5,600, and the total assets are $2,240. So the percentage each creditor gets is (total assets / total liabilities) multiplied by their individual claim. Or wait, is it the other way around? Maybe it's total assets divided by total liabilities to get the dividend per dollar of liability.

So the formula would be: (Total Assets / Total Liabilities) * Individual Claim.

Plugging in the numbers: (2,240 / 5,600) * 1,725.

Let me calculate that. 2,240 divided by 5,600. Hmm, 2,240 is less than half of 5,600. Let me compute it: 2240 / 5600 = 0.4. Oh wait, 2240 is 40% of 5600 because 2240 * 2.5 is 5600. So 2240 / 5600 = 0.4.

So then, 0.4 times 1,725. Let's compute that. 1,725 * 0.4. Well, 1,000 * 0.4 is 400, 700 * 0.4 is 280, 25 * 0.4 is 10. So 400 + 280 is 680, plus 10 is 690. So Mr. Johnson would get $690.

Looking at the options, option C is $690. So the answer should be C.

Wait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Another way to think about it is that the total available is $2,240, and the total owed is $5,600. So each creditor gets 2,240 / 5,600 = 0.4 of their claim. So 1,725 * 0.4 is indeed 690. Yep, that seems right.

To determine how much Mr. Johnson can expect to receive from Mr. Williams' bankruptcy, we need to calculate the proportion of assets available for distribution relative to the total liabilities. Mr. Williams has $2,240 in assets and $5,600 in liabilities, meaning creditors will receive a fraction of their claims. The fraction is calculated as:

\[
\text{Fraction} = \frac{\text{Total Assets}}{\text{Total Liabilities}} = \frac{2,240}{5,600} = 0.4
\]

Mr. Johnson's claim is $1,725. Applying the fraction:

\[
\text{Amount Received} = 0.4 \times 1,725 = 690
\]

Thus, Mr. Johnson can expect to receive $690. The correct answer is:

**C: $690**
