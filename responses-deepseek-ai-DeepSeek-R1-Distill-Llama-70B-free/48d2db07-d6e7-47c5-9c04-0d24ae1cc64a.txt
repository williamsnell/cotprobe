Okay, I need to figure out which option is the best set of data to test the shipping charge program. So the problem is about Airmail Express's charging system based on weight ranges. Let's break down the criteria.

First, the charges are in specific weight intervals. The ranges are:
- 0 < w ≤ 2: $4.00
- 2 < w ≤5: $8.00
- 5 < w ≤20: $15.00
And any package over 20 is not accepted.

So to test the program properly, the test cases should cover all the boundary conditions. That means for each weight range, I should test the lower and upper bounds, as well as values just inside and just outside the boundaries. Also, I need to include some invalid cases like weights that are too high or negative.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 0,3,6,9,12,15,18,21
- 0 is the lower limit of the first range, but wait, the first range is w>0. So 0 is invalid. 3 is in the second range. 6,9, etc., are in the third. 21 is over 20, which is invalid. But does this option cover all the boundaries? It has some points but maybe misses some key ones like 2 or 5.

Option B: 2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20
- 2 is the upper limit of the first range. But wait, the first range is up to and including 2. Wait, the second range starts above 2. So 2 is in the first charge. But this option has 2, which is correct. Then 4 is in the second range. 6 is in the third. 20 is the upper limit. But does this include any invalid weights? No, all are valid except maybe 20 is the max. But maybe it's missing the just over 5, like 5.5? Or perhaps edge cases like 5 or 0? Hmm, this option doesn't have 0 or 5, but includes 2 and 20. Also, no negative numbers or over 20. So maybe not testing all possible invalid cases.

Option C: -1,1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,20
- Includes negative, which is invalid. 1 is in the first range. 3 in second. 5 is the boundary. 7 and up in third. 20 is the max. But wait, does this cover all the boundaries? Like just above 2 (like 3 is there) and just above 5 (like 5 is the edge, but 5 is included in the third range? Wait, the third range is 5 < w ≤20, so 5 is not included in the third. So 5 would fall into the second range. Oh wait, the second range is 2 < w ≤5. So 5 is the upper limit of the second. So testing 5 is important because it's the max of the second tier. So C includes 5, which is good. But does it have a weight just above 5, like 6? Yes, 7 is there, but that's well into the third range. Also, includes -1 (invalid), 1 (lower in first), 3 (mid second), 5 (upper second), 20 (upper third). So C covers a lot, but maybe not all edge cases.

Option D: -1,0,1,2,3,5,16,20,22
- This includes -1 (invalid), 0 (invalid), 1 (first range), 2 (upper first), 3 (second range), 5 (upper second), 16 (third), 20 (upper third), 22 (invalid). So this covers all the boundaries and includes invalid cases. That seems pretty thorough. Let me think: 0 is invalid as per the first condition (0 < w), so including 0 is good to test for that. Similarly, 22 is over 20, which is invalid. Also, 2 is the upper limit of the first tier, 5 is the upper of second. So this option hits all the exact points where the charge changes, plus the invalid ones.

Option E: -1,1,2,3,5,16,20
- So it's missing 0 and 22, but has -1. It has 1,2 (boundary),3,5 (boundary),16,20. So this is similar to D but without 0 and 22. So maybe not as comprehensive as D.

Option F: 0,2,5,20
- Only four points. 0 is invalid, 2 is upper first, 5 upper second, 20 upper third. But this misses a lot of other edge cases, like just over 2, just under 5, etc. Also, doesn't include any invalid over 20.

Option G: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10
- All valid weights. But misses the exact boundaries and the invalid cases. So it's testing within the ranges but not the edges where the behavior changes. So it's not the best for thorough testing.

Option H: 1,4,16
- Only three points. 1 is in first, 4 in second, 16 in third. But misses all the boundaries and invalid cases. Not thorough.

Option I: -1,0,2,5,10,15,20,21
- Includes -1 (invalid), 0 (invalid), 2 (upper first), 5 (upper second), 10,15 in third, 20 (upper third), 21 (invalid). So this includes all the boundaries and some invalids. It's similar to D but D has 22 as invalid, but I has 21. Both are good. Wait, but I's set includes 0 and 21, which are invalid. So this set is pretty good.

Option J: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,20
- 0 is invalid, 1 in first, 2 upper first, 3 in second, 4 in second, 5 upper second,6 in third, 20 upper third. But no invalids beyond 0 (like negatives or over 20). So it's missing some test cases.

Now, comparing options D, I, and others. Option D includes -1,0,1,2,3,5,16,20,22. So that's 9 test cases, covering all the boundaries and invalids. Option I has -1,0,2,5,10,15,20,21. So 8 test cases, also with all boundaries and invalids.

But looking at the problem statement, the best set should test all possible boundaries. So for each range, the test should include:

- Just below the lower boundary (like 0 for the first range, which is invalid)
- The lower boundary (like 1 for the first range)
- Just above the lower boundary (like 2 would fall into the second range)
Wait, no. Wait the ranges are:

First: (0,2], so 2 is included in first. Second: (2,5], so 5 is included in second. Third: (5,20], 20 included.

So, the test cases should include:

- Negative (invalid)
- 0 (invalid)
- 1 (in first)
- 2 (upper limit first)
- 3 (in second)
- 5 (upper limit second)
- 6 (in third)
- 20 (upper third)
- 21 (invalid)

Looking for an option that includes as many of these as possible.

Option D includes -1,0,1,2,3,5,16,20,22. So it has -1,0,1,2,3,5,16,20,22. So it's missing 6, but has 16 which is in the third. So 16 is in third. So it covers all the boundaries except perhaps just above 5 (like 6). But perhaps 3,5 are included, so that's covered.

Option I includes -1,0,2,5,10,15,20,21. So it has -1,0,2,5,20,21. But where's 1,3,6, etc.? So it's missing some of the lower ranges.

Option E is missing some as well.

So the best option would be one that includes all the boundary points and some invalids. Option D includes all the exact upper bounds (2,5,20), the lower invalids (-1,0), and an over 20 (22). It also includes 1,3,16 which are within the ranges. So this seems comprehensive.

Wait, but looking back, option D is: -1,0,1,2,3,5,16,20,22.

So that's:

- Negative: -1
- Zero: 0
- Just above zero: 1
- Upper first: 2
- Just above upper first:3
- Upper second:5
- Middle third:16
- Upper third:20
- Over:22

That covers all the critical points. So this would test each condition.

Option I is similar but lacks some points like 3 and 16 but includes 10 and 15, which are in the third range. So D has more boundary points.

So the best set is either D or I, but D includes more boundary points. Hmm.

Wait, another thought: the problem states that the company doesn't accept packages over 20, so including 21 (I) or 22 (D) is good, but both are acceptable. The key is to cover all the boundaries.

So I think the answer is either D or I. Wait, but looking back at the options.

Wait, option D is: −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 16, 20, 22.

That's 9 values. It includes 0, which is invalid; -1, invalid; 1,2,3,5 which are all the boundary points. 16 is in third, 20 is the upper, 22 invalid.

Option I: −1,0,2,5,10,15,20,21 → includes 0, 2,5,20,21, but misses 1,3,16.

So, D is better because it includes 1 and 3, which are just inside their ranges, and 16 which is a middle third.

Wait, but 5 is included in D, which is the upper limit of the second tier. So in D, all the upper bounds are covered.

So the best set is option D.

To determine the best set of data to test the shipping charge program, we need to cover all boundary conditions, including invalid weights. The charging system is based on the following weight ranges:

- **0 < w ≤ 2**: $4.00  
- **2 < w ≤ 5**: $8.00  
- **5 < w ≤ 20**: $15.00  

The company does not accept packages weighing more than 20 pounds or less than or equal to 0 pounds. Therefore, the test cases should include:

1. **Invalid weights**: Negative values (e.g., -1) and 0 (since 0 is not included in the first range).  
2. **Boundary values**: The upper limits of each range (2, 5, 20) and values just inside and just outside these boundaries.  
3. **Values within each range**: To ensure the program correctly calculates charges for weights inside the specified ranges.  

### Analysis of Options:

- **Option A**: Includes 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21.  
  - Covers some boundary values (e.g., 2 is missing) and invalid weights (e.g., 21). However, it lacks key boundary values like 2, 5, and 20.  

- **Option B**: Includes 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20.  
  - Covers boundary values like 2, 5 (missing), and 20, but lacks invalid weights (e.g., negative values or 0).  

- **Option C**: Includes -1, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 20.  
  - Covers invalid weights (-1), boundary values (2 is missing), and values within ranges. However, it lacks 0 and 21/22 to test invalid cases fully.  

- **Option D**: Includes -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 16, 20, 22.  
  - Covers all boundary values (2, 5, 20), invalid weights (-1, 0, 22), and values just inside and outside the boundaries (e.g., 1, 3, 16). This is a comprehensive set.  

- **Option E**: Includes -1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 16, 20.  
  - Similar to D but lacks 0 and 22, making it less thorough.  

- **Option F**: Includes 0, 2, 5, 20.  
  - Only includes boundary values and 0 but lacks invalid weights (e.g., negative values or over 20).  

- **Option G**: Includes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.  
  - Focuses on valid weights within ranges but lacks boundary values and invalid cases.  

- **Option H**: Includes 1, 4, 16.  
  - Too limited, missing boundary values and invalid cases.  

- **Option I**: Includes -1, 0, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 21.  
  - Covers invalid weights (-1, 0, 21), boundary values (2, 5, 20), and values within ranges (10, 15). However, it lacks 1 and 3, which are just inside the first and second ranges.  

- **Option J**: Includes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 20.  
  - Covers boundary values and values within ranges but lacks invalid weights over 20.  

### Conclusion:

Option D is the most comprehensive set, as it includes all boundary values (2, 5, 20), invalid weights (-1, 0, 22), and values just inside and outside the boundaries (1, 3, 16). This ensures thorough testing of the program's behavior under all possible conditions.
