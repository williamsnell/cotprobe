Okay, so I've got this problem about electric dipoles and the work required to turn them in an electric field. Hmm, electric dipole... I remember that an electric dipole consists of two equal and opposite charges separated by a small distance. The dipole moment p is given as the product of the charge and the separation distance, pointing from the negative to the positive charge.

The question is about how much work is needed to turn the dipole 180 degrees in a uniform electric field. The initial angle is 64 degrees. Wait, wait, so the dipole is initially at 64 degrees relative to the electric field, and we're flipping it to 180 degrees from that? Or wait, no, the question says turning it 180 degrees, so maybe the initial angle is 64, and we're turning it so that the total change is 180 degrees. Or perhaps the initial angle is 64 degrees, and we're flipping it to 180-64=116 degrees on the other side? Hmm, no, I think the problem is that the dipole is being rotated from its initial position by 180 degrees. So the angle it makes with the field changes by 180 degrees.

Wait, no. Actually, the initial angle is θ_initial = 64 degrees. When you rotate it by 180 degrees, the final angle would be θ_final = 64 + 180 = 244 degrees. But wait, angles are periodic every 360 degrees, so 244 is equivalent to 244 - 180 = 64 degrees on the other side. Wait, but wait, if the dipole is symmetric, the potential energy depends on the angle between the dipole moment and the electric field. So when you rotate it by 180 degrees, it's like flipping it around. So the initial angle is 64 degrees, and the final angle is 64 + 180 = 244, but since cos is periodic every 360, cos(244) is same as cos(244-180)=cos(64). Wait no, cos(180+θ) is -cosθ. So cos(244) = cos(180+64) = -cos(64). So the potential energy change will depend on the difference between the initial and final cosθ.

Wait, but the formula for the work done in rotating an electric dipole is related to the change in potential energy. The potential energy U of a dipole in an electric field is U = -p·E = -pE cosθ, where θ is the angle between p and E.

The work done by an external force to change the dipole's orientation is equal to the change in potential energy. So W = ΔU = U_final - U_initial.

But wait, actually, the work done by an external torque is the negative of the change in potential energy. Let me get this right. When the dipole is rotated by an external force, the work done is equal to the change in potential energy. Or is it the other way around?

I think the formula is W = pE (cosθ_initial - cosθ_final). Because the potential energy U is -pE cosθ, so the change ΔU = U_final - U_initial = [-pE cosθ_final] - [-pE cosθ_initial] = pE (cosθ_initial - cosθ_final). 

So the work done by the external force is equal to the change in potential energy, which is ΔU = pE (cosθ_initial - cosθ_final).

Wait, let me think again. Suppose the dipole is at angle θ_initial. The potential energy is U_initial = -pE cosθ_initial. After rotation, U_final = -pE cosθ_final. So the change in potential energy is U_final - U_initial = -pE (cosθ_final - cosθ_initial). So ΔU = pE (cosθ_initial - cosθ_final).

But the work done by the external torque is the negative of the work done by the electric field. So if the potential energy increases, the work done by the external force is positive, meaning you have to do work. If the potential energy decreases, the electric field does the work.

So in this problem, the work required (W) is the amount of work done by an external agent to rotate the dipole. So W = ΔU = U_final - U_initial.

Wait no, no. Wait, the work done by the external torque is equal to the change in potential energy. So when you turn the dipole against the field direction, you're increasing the potential energy, so you have to do positive work.

So the formula should be W = pE (cosθ_initial - cosθ_final). Because if θ_final is such that cosθ_final is less than cosθ_initial, then W is positive.

Wait, let's take an example. Suppose the dipole is initially aligned with the field, θ_initial = 0 degrees. Then, cosθ_initial =1. If you rotate it 180 degrees, θ_final = 180, cosθ_final = -1. So W = pE (1 - (-1)) = pE (2). So the work is 2 pE, which makes sense because you're going from the lowest potential energy (U = -pE) to the highest (U = pE), so the change is 2 pE. So the work done by the external torque is positive, as expected.

So in this problem, the initial angle is 64 degrees, and it's being rotated by 180 degrees. Wait, no. The problem states that the dipole is turned 180 degrees, so the change in angle is 180 degrees. So the initial angle is 64, final is 64 + 180 = 244 degrees. But wait, angles wrap around every 360, so 244 is the same as -116 degrees. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute cos(64 + 180) which is cos(244) = cos(180 + 64) = -cos(64), because cos(180 + θ) = -cosθ.

So cosθ_final = cos(244) = -cos(64).

So plugging into the formula, W = p E ( cosθ_initial - cosθ_final ) = p E ( cos(64) - (-cos(64)) ) = p E ( 2 cos(64) )

Wait, because cosθ_final is -cos(64), so cosθ_initial is cos(64), so cosθ_initial - cosθ_final = cos64 - (-cos64) = 2 cos64.

So W = p E * 2 cos(64 degrees).

Wait, but wait, the dipole is being turned 180 degrees, so the initial angle is θ_initial = 64 degrees, and the final angle is θ_final = θ_initial + 180 = 244 degrees. Alternatively, the dipole could have been rotated in the opposite direction, ending up at 64 - 180 = -116 degrees, but the cosine is the same because cos is even, cos(-x)=cosx. So regardless, the final angle's cosine is -cos(64).

So W = p E (cos64 - (-cos64) ) = 2 p E cos64.

Wait, but wait, E is given as 46 N/C, and p is 3.02e-25 C·m.

So let me plug in the numbers.

First, compute cos(64 degrees). Let me get my calculator. Hmm, 64 degrees in radians is about 1.117 radians, but I'll just compute the cosine. Cos(60) is 0.5, cos(64) is a bit less. Let's say approximately 0.4384.

Wait, more accurately, using calculator: cos(64°) ≈ 0.43837.

So W = 2 * p * E * cos(64) ≈ 2 * (3.02e-25 C·m) * (46 N/C) * 0.43837.

Let me compute step by step.

First, compute 2 * p * E: 2 * 3.02e-25 *46 = 2 * 3.02 *46 * 1e-25.

Compute 3.02 *46: 3*46=138, 0.02*46=0.92, so total 138.92. Multiply by 2: 277.84.

So 277.84e-25 = 2.7784e-23.

Wait, no, wait: 3.02e-25 * 46 = let's compute 3.02 *46 = 138.92, so 138.92e-25. Multiply by 2 gives 277.84e-25, which is 2.7784e-23.

Now multiply by cos(64) ≈ 0.43837.

So 2.7784e-23 * 0.43837 ≈ let's compute that.

2.7784 * 0.43837 ≈ 1.218 approximately.

So 1.218e-23 J.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option I is 1.22e-23 J, which matches closely.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculation.

Wait, 3.02 *46= 3 *46=138, 0.02 *46=0.92, so 138 +0.92=138.92. So 3.02e-25 *46=138.92e-25 = 1.3892e-23. Multiply by 2 gives 2.7784e-23.

Multiply by 0.43837: 2.7784e-23 * 0.43837.

Compute 2.7784 * 0.43837.

Let me compute 2 *0.43837=0.87674.

0.7784 *0.43837: Hmm, 0.7 *0.43837=0.30686, 0.07 *0.43837=0.0306869, 0.0084 *0.43837≈0.00368.

Adding those: 0.30686 +0.0306869=0.3375469 +0.00368≈0.3412269.

So total 0.87674 +0.3412269≈1.21796, approximately 1.218.

So 1.218e-23 J, which is approximately 1.22e-23 J, which is option I.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss a negative sign or something. The formula W = p E (cosθ_initial - cosθ_final). θ_final is 244, so cosθ_final is -cos64. So cosθ_initial is cos64, cosθ_final is -cos64.

So cosθ_initial - cosθ_final = cos64 - (-cos64) = 2 cos64.

So W = p E (2 cos64), which is positive, as expected.

Yes, that's correct. So the work done is positive, which makes sense since you're rotating against the field direction beyond 90 degrees.

So the correct answer should be option I: 1.22e-23 J.

To determine the work required to rotate an electric dipole by $180^\circ$ in a uniform electric field, we use the formula for the work done:

\[
W = pE (\cos\theta_{\text{initial}} - \cos\theta_{\text{final}})
\]

Here:
- $p = 3.02 \times 10^{-25} \, \mathrm{C \cdot m}$ (dipole moment),
- $E = 46.0 \, \mathrm{N/C}$ (electric field),
- $\theta_{\text{initial}} = 64^\circ$,
- $\theta_{\text{final}} = 64^\circ + 180^\circ = 244^\circ$.

The cosine of $244^\circ$ can be simplified using the identity $\cos(180^\circ + \theta) = -\cos\theta$, so $\cos(244^\circ) = -\cos(64^\circ)$. Substituting this into the formula:

\[
W = pE \left(\cos(64^\circ) - (-\cos(64^\circ))\right) = pE \cdot 2\cos(64^\circ).
\]

Next, we calculate $\cos(64^\circ) \approx 0.4384$. Substituting the values:

\[
W = 2 \cdot (3.02 \times 10^{-25}) \cdot 46.0 \cdot 0.4384.
\]

First, compute $2 \cdot 3.02 \cdot 46.0 = 277.84$, so:

\[
W = 277.84 \times 10^{-25} \cdot 0.4384.
\]

Simplify further:

\[
W \approx 1.218 \times 10^{-23} \, \mathrm{J}.
\]

Comparing this result to the options provided, the closest match is:

**I: $1.22 \times 10^{-23} \, \mathrm{J}$.**

Thus, the correct answer is:

I
