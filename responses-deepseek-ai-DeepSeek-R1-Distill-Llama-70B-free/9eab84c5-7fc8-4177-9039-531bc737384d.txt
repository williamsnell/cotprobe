Question:

A city ordinance forbids washing vehicles parked on city streets. A man washes his car while it is parked on the street in front of his home. The water forms a puddle in the street, which freezes over during the night. Early the next morning, a car driving on the street slides on the ice and crashes into a tree. If the driver of the car sues the man and asserts that the man was negligent per Se, which of the following additional facts would help the man the most?

Options:

A: The man had already planned to dry the water before it froze, but was unable to because of an unexpected emergency.
B: The driver lives in the man's neighborhood and saw the man washing his car the day before the accident.
C: The city had been warned about the icy conditions but had not salted the streets.
D: The driver is not a resident of the city.
E: The man had been washing his car on the street for years without any previous incidents.
F: The driver had previously been involved in multiple accidents due to reckless driving.
G: The man had placed a warning sign near the puddle to alert drivers of the potential hazard.
H: The man was not aware of the ordinance.
I: The driver was driving at an excessively high speed at the time of the accident.
J: The city council enacted the ordinance after someone washing his car was hit by a passing truck.

Okay, so I have this question about negligence per se, and I need to figure out which additional fact would help the man the most. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that negligence per se is when a law is violated, and that violation is considered negligence automatically. So if the man broke the ordinance by washing his car on the street, that could be negligence per se if it's the cause of the accident.

The question is about which fact would help the man's case. So I'm looking for a fact that either shows he wasn't negligent, or that there's another reason the accident happened that's not his fault.

Looking at the options:

Option A: He planned to dry the water but couldn't because of an emergency. That might show he took some responsibility, but if he created the hazard, maybe it's not enough. But it could help mitigate by showing he had intent to prevent the danger.

Option B: The driver saw him washing the car. Not sure how that helps the man. Maybe the driver should have been more cautious, but I don't see how that directly helps the man's defense.

Option C: The city didn't salt the streets despite warnings. This could show that the city was also at fault, which might lead to shared liability or that the main cause was the city's failure, not the man's action. So this could help the man by shifting some blame.

Option D: Driver isn't a city resident. I don't think that matters much. The ordinance applies regardless of where the driver is from.

Option E: He's been washing his car for years without issues. This goes to show that maybe the ordinance isn't really necessary or that his actions didn't usually cause harm. But does that negate negligence per se? I'm not sure. It might help with the foreseeability aspect.

Option F: Driver had multiple reckless accidents. This could imply that the driver's own behavior was the cause, not the man's. So contributory negligence, but I'm not sure if that's a full defense or just reduces damages.

Option G: He placed a warning sign. That sounds like it would help. If he warned drivers, then even if the ice was there, drivers were aware and could have been cautious. So this could show that he took steps to mitigate the danger after creating it.

Option H: He wasn't aware of the ordinance. But under negligence per se, you don't have to know the law. Ignorance of the law is no excuse, so this probably doesn't help.

Option I: Driver was speeding. That's a biggie. If the driver was going too fast, that's their own negligence. So this could show that the man's action wasn't the proximate cause, or that the driver's action contributed to the accident. This might help the man by providing another cause for the crash.

Option J: The ordinance was enacted after an incident where someone washing their car was hit by a truck. Hmm, so the reason for the ordinance was to prevent people washing cars from being hit, not necessarily about ice forming. So maybe the man's action isn't the kind of harm the ordinance was meant to prevent. That could be a good point because, for negligence per se, the violation must cause the type of harm the law was meant to prevent. If the ordinance was about being hit by a truck while washing, not about ice, then maybe the man's action doesn't fit the intended scope, so negligence per se doesn't apply.

So which of these would help the man the most?

If the ordinance wasn't meant to prevent this kind of harm (ice causing an accident), then the man's violation wouldn't count as negligence per se. So option J would help because it shows the law was intended for a different risk.

Alternatively, option I would help by showing the driver's own negligence contributed, but that might be more about comparative negligence rather than defeating the per se claim.

So between J and I. Also, option C could help by showing the city didn't act, but I'm not sure if that's as strong as J.

Wait, but if the man's action was the cause, then even if the city didn't salt, that's another factor. But the question is about which fact would help the man the most against the negligence per se claim.

Negligence per se requires that the statute was designed to prevent the type of harm that occurred. So if the ordinance was about a different kind of harm, then the man's action wouldn't meet the per se standard.

So option J would show that the ordinance was enacted to prevent people being hit by trucks while washing cars, not about ice forming. Therefore, the harm that occurred (someone slipping on ice) isn't the type the ordinance was meant to prevent. So the man couldn't be held liable under negligence per se.

That would be a strong defense, so J is the best answer.

To determine which additional fact would help the man the most in defending against a claim of negligence per se, it is important to focus on whether the fact undermines the applicability of negligence per se or shifts liability elsewhere. Negligence per se applies when a statute is violated, and the violation directly causes the type of harm the statute was intended to prevent.

- **Option A**: The man's intent to dry the water before it froze but being unable to do so due to an emergency might show some responsibility but does not negate the creation of the hazard.
- **Option B**: The driver witnessing the man washing his car does not directly help the man's defense.
- **Option C**: The city's failure to salt the streets could indicate shared liability but does not directly undermine the negligence per se claim against the man.
- **Option D**: The driver's residency status is irrelevant to the man's liability.
- **Option E**: The man's history of washing his car without incidents might suggest the ordinance is unnecessary but does not negate the negligence per se claim.
- **Option F**: The driver's history of reckless driving could suggest contributory negligence but does not fully absolve the man of liability.
- **Option G**: Placing a warning sign might mitigate liability by showing the man took steps to address the hazard.
- **Option H**: Ignorance of the ordinance is not a valid defense under negligence per se.
- **Option I**: The driver's excessive speed could show contributory negligence but does not directly defeat the negligence per se claim.
- **Option J**: If the ordinance was enacted to prevent a different type of harm (e.g., being hit by a truck while washing a car) rather than the harm that occurred (ice causing an accident), this directly undermines the applicability of negligence per se. It shows the ordinance was not designed to prevent the specific harm that occurred, which is a critical element of negligence per se.

Among these, **Option J** is the strongest defense because it challenges the applicability of negligence per se by demonstrating that the ordinance was not intended to prevent the type of harm that occurred. This would directly help the man the most in defending against the claim.
