Question:

If there were a leverage effect in practice, what would be the shape of the news impact curve for as model that accounted for that leverage?

Options:

A: It would rise more quickly for negative disturbances than for positive ones of the same magnitude
B: It would be symmetrical about zero
C: It would rise less quickly for negative disturbances than for positive ones of the same magnitude
D: It would be zero for all positive disturbances

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about the leverage effect and its impact on the news impact curve. Hmm, I remember that the leverage effect has something to do with volatility and stock returns, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me think this through.

Wait, the leverage effect, also known as financial leverage, is when a company's use of debt affects its equity value. But in the context of volatility, I think it's about how volatility reacts differently to positive and negative shocks. Oh right, asymmetric volatility! So the leverage effect suggests that negative returns (like when the stock price drops) lead to higher volatility than positive returns of the same magnitude.

So the question is about the shape of the news impact curve when a model accounts for leverage. The news impact curve shows how volatility reacts to news shocks. Without leverage, I suppose the curve would be symmetric. That is, whether the news is positive or negative, the increase in volatility would be the same for the same magnitude of news. But with leverage, negative news should have a bigger effect.

Looking at the options:

A: It would rise more quickly for negative disturbances than for positive ones of the same magnitude. That makes sense because negative shocks cause more volatility due to leverage.

B: Symmetrical about zero. No, because leverage causes asymmetry.

C: Rise less quickly for negatives. Opposite of what we want.

D: Zero for positive disturbances. That doesn't make sense. Positive news would still affect volatility, just less than negative news.

So the correct answer should be A.

The leverage effect explains that negative disturbances lead to greater increases in volatility than positive ones of the same magnitude. This asymmetry arises because negative shocks increase financial leverage, amplifying volatility. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Correct, as negative disturbances cause a quicker rise in volatility.
- **B**: Incorrect, as the curve is asymmetric, not symmetric.
- **C**: Incorrect, as it suggests the opposite effect.
- **D**: Incorrect, as positive disturbances still affect volatility.

Answer: **A**
