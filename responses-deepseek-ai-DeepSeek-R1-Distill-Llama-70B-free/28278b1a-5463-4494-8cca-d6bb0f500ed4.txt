Okay, so I have this integral to compute: the double integral over the volume V of dx dy dz divided by (1 + x + y + z) cubed. And the region V is defined as all (x, y, z) where each is non-negative and their sum is less than or equal to 1. Hmm, okay.

First, I need to visualize the region V. It's the set of points in 3D space where x, y, z are all greater than or equal to zero, and their sum is less than or equal to one. So that's like a tetrahedron in the first octant bounded by the planes x=0, y=0, z=0, and x+y+z=1.

The integral is ∫∫∫_V [1/(1 + x + y + z)^3] dx dy dz. Hmm, that seems a bit tricky. I remember that integrating over such a region often involves using substitution or maybe changing variables to make the integral simpler. The denominator is (1 + x + y + z)^3, which suggests maybe a substitution where u = x + y + z or something similar.

Wait, another approach: since the region V is a tetrahedron, perhaps I can use a change of variables to a simplex in terms of variables that sum to a constant. Or maybe spherical coordinates, but I'm not sure if that's the best approach here.

Wait, the denominator is (1 + s)^3 where s = x + y + z. So maybe I can let s = x + y + z, and then the integral becomes something involving s. But I'm not sure how to handle the rest. Alternatively, maybe using a substitution like u = 1 + x + y + z. Then, the denominator becomes u^3. But then I need to express dx dy dz in terms of du and other variables. Hmm, that might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps using the method of multiple integrals by iterated integration. Let me think about the limits. Since x, y, z are all non-negative and x + y + z ≤ 1, I can set up the integral in terms of z from 0 to 1, then for each z, y goes from 0 to 1 - z, and x goes from 0 to 1 - y - z. Wait, no, that might not be the right order. Alternatively, maybe express it as:

Integral from z=0 to 1, then for each z, y from 0 to 1 - z, and x from 0 to 1 - y - z. But that seems a bit messy, but perhaps manageable.

Wait, but integrating [1/(1 + x + y + z)^3] over this region. Let me see if I can find a substitution that would simplify this. Maybe set u = x + y + z, but that leaves me with other variables. Alternatively, perhaps using a substitution like v = 1 + u, so dv = du, but I'm not sure.

Wait, another idea: using the concept of Dirichlet integrals. I remember that integrals over simplices can be expressed using beta functions or gamma functions. The standard simplex in n dimensions has volume related to 1/n! but this is a 3-dimensional case, so the simplex is in 3D.

Wait, the integral ∫_{x+y+z ≤1, x,y,z ≥0} (x + y + z)^k dx dy dz is known. For some k. In this problem, the integrand is (1 +x + y +z)^{-3}, which is (1 + s)^{-3} where s =x + y + z.

Hmm, perhaps I can perform a substitution t = s + 1, so when s=0, t=1, and when s=1, t=2. Then, the integral becomes ∫∫∫ (t)^{-3} times the volume element dx dy dz. But I'm not sure how to express this substitution properly.

Alternatively, perhaps using the substitution u = x, v = y, w = z, but that doesn't change anything. Maybe I can use a change of variables that simplifies the denominator. Let me think: let me set a = x, b = y, c = z, and t = a + b + c. Then, the integral becomes ∫∫∫ [1/(1 + t)^3] da db dc, but I'm not sure how to handle the t in terms of a, b, c.

Wait, perhaps I can switch to barycentric coordinates or some other coordinate system where the condition a + b + c ≤1 is easier to handle. Another approach is to use the fact that the integral can be expressed as an integral over s from 0 to 1, where for each s, the area (or volume) element is proportional to s^2, since in 3D, the area of a sphere (or the simplex in this case) at a distance s is proportional to s^2. But I'm not sure about the exact expression.

Wait, more accurately, for each s, the volume element when x + y + z = s is a 2-simplex (triangle) in 3D space. The volume (area, in this case) of this simplex is (s^2)/(2!), since in n dimensions, the volume of the simplex defined by x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n ≤ s is s^{n-1}/(n-1)! So in 3D, for a simplex where x + y + z = s, the area is s²/(2!).

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The volume in 3D for x + y + z ≤ s, with x, y, z ≥0, is s³/(3!) = s³/6. So the volume element when moving from s to s + ds would be the derivative of that, which is (3s²)/6 = s²/2. So the area (in 3D, it's a 2D area) at a given s is s²/2.

Wait, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute the integral using iterated integrals.

Let me try setting up the integral in terms of x, y, z. The limits are: z goes from 0 to 1. For each z, y goes from 0 to 1 - z. For each y and z, x goes from 0 to 1 - y - z.

So the integral becomes:

∫ (z=0 to 1) ∫ (y=0 to 1 - z) ∫ (x=0 to 1 - y - z) [1/(1 + x + y + z)^3] dx dy dz.

Hmm, perhaps I can compute the innermost integral first, integrating with respect to x. Let me denote s = x + y + z. Then, when integrating with respect to x, y and z are held constant, so s = x + (y + z). Let me set u = x + y + z, so when x=0, u = y + z, and when x = 1 - y - z, u = 1.

Wait, so the inner integral ∫ (x=0 to 1 - y - z) [1/(1 + x + y + z)^3] dx.

Let me let t = 1 + x + y + z. Then, when x=0, t=1 + y + z. When x=1 - y - z, t=1 + (1 - y - z) + y + z = 2.

So dt = dx, because d/dx of t is 1. So the integral becomes ∫ (t = 1 + y + z to 2) [1/t^3] dt.

Integrating 1/t^3 is [-1/(2 t^2)] evaluated from t = (1 + y + z) to t=2.

So that gives [-1/(2*(2)^2)] - [-1/(2*(1 + y + z)^2)] = (-1/8) + [1/(2*(1 + y + z)^2)].

So the inner integral, after integrating over x, is [1/(2*(1 + y + z)^2)] - 1/8.

Wait, no. Let me compute that again. The integral of t^(-3) dt is (t^(-2))/(-2) + C. So evaluating from a to b gives [(-1)/(2 b²)] - [(-1)/(2 a²)] = [1/(2 a²) - 1/(2 b²)].

In our case, a = 1 + y + z, b = 2.

So the inner integral is [1/(2*(1 + y + z)^2) ) - 1/(2*(2)^2) ) ] = [1/(2(1 + y + z)^2) - 1/8 ].

Wait, no, wait: when you integrate from a to b, it's F(b) - F(a). So F(b) is (-1)/(2 b²), F(a) is (-1)/(2 a²). So F(b) - F(a) = [ (-1/(2 b²)) ] - [ (-1/(2 a²)) ] = (-1/(2 b²)) + 1/(2 a²) = (1/(2 a²) ) - (1/(2 b²)).

So yes, that's correct. So the inner integral is [1/(2 (1 + y + z)^2) ) - 1/(8) ].

Now, the integral becomes:

∫ (z=0 to 1) ∫ (y=0 to 1 - z) [1/(2 (1 + y + z)^2) - 1/8 ] dy dz.

Let me split this into two integrals: I1 and I2.

I = ∫∫ [1/(2 (1 + y + z)^2) ] dy dz - ∫∫ [1/8 ] dy dz.

Let me compute I1 and I2 separately.

First, I2 is easier: ∫ (z=0 to1) ∫ (y=0 to 1 - z) [1/8] dy dz.

The inner integral over y is (1 - z) * (1/8), since the integrand is constant with respect to y. Then, I2 becomes ∫ (z=0 to1) (1 - z)/8 dz.

Integral of (1 - z)/8 from 0 to1 is (1/8) ∫ (1 - z) dz from 0 to1. Which is (1/8) [ z - (z²)/2 ] evaluated from 0 to1.

At z=1: 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. At z=0: 0. So (1/8)(1/2) ) = 1/16.

So I2 = 1/16.

Now, let's compute I1: ∫ (z=0 to1) ∫ (y=0 to 1 - z) [1/(2 (1 + y + z)^2) ] dy dz.

Let me make a substitution in the inner integral. Let u = y + z + 1. Then, when y=0, u = z + 1. When y=1 - z, u = 1 + z + (1 - z) )= 2.

Also, du = dy, since z is held constant in the inner integral.

So the inner integral becomes ∫ (u = z + 1 to 2) [1/(2 u²) ] du.

Which is (1/2) ∫ u^(-2) du from u = z + 1 to 2.

Integral of u^(-2) is (-1/u) + C.

So the inner integral is (1/2) [ (-1/2) - (-1/(z + 1)) ) ] = (1/2) [ (1/(z + 1)) - 1/2 ) ].

Simplify: (1/2)[ (1/(z+1) - 1/2) ] = (1/(2(z+1)) ) - 1/4.

So I1 becomes ∫ (z=0 to1) [1/(2(z+1)) - 1/4 ] dz.

Let me split this into two terms:

I1 = ∫ [1/(2(z+1)) ] dz - ∫ [1/4 ] dz, both from 0 to1.

Compute each integral separately.

First integral: (1/2) ∫ 1/(z+1) dz from 0 to1. The integral of 1/(z+1) is ln|z+1| + C. So evaluating from 0 to1:

(1/2) [ ln(2) - ln(1) ] = (1/2)(ln 2 - 0) )= (ln 2)/2.

Second integral: ∫ [1/4 ] dz from 0 to1 is (1/4)(1 - 0) = 1/4.

So I1 = (ln 2)/2 - 1/4.

Putting it all together, the original integral I = I1 - I2:

I = [ (ln 2)/2 - 1/4 ] - [1/16 ].

Wait, no. Wait, I think I might have made a mistake in the signs. Because the original integral I is I1 minus I2.

Wait, wait. Let's go back. The integral after the inner x integral was [1/(2 (1 + y + z)^2) ) - 1/8 ].

So when we split it into I1 and I2, I1 is the integral of the first term, and I2 is the integral of the second term. So I = I1 - I2.

So, I1 is [ (ln 2)/2 - 1/4 ] and I2 is 1/16.

Thus, I = [ (ln 2)/2 - 1/4 ] - (1/16 )

Simplify: (ln 2)/2 - 1/4 - 1/16.

Combine the constants: -1/4 is -4/16, so -4/16 -1/16 = -5/16.

So I = (ln 2)/2 - 5/16.

Hmm, let me compute that numerically. Let's compute each term.

ln 2 is approximately 0.6931. So (ln 2)/2 is about 0.3466.

5/16 is 0.3125.

So 0.3466 - 0.3125 = 0.0341.

So approximately 0.0341.

Looking at the options, option J is 0.034. So the answer should be J.

To compute the integral 

\[
\iiint_V \frac{dx \, dy \, dz}{(1 + x + y + z)^3},
\]

where \( V = \{(x, y, z) : x, y, z \geq 0, x + y + z \leq 1\} \), we proceed as follows:

### Step 1: Understand the region of integration
The region \( V \) is a tetrahedron in the first octant bounded by the planes \( x = 0 \), \( y = 0 \), \( z = 0 \), and \( x + y + z = 1 \). This suggests using iterated integration with the limits:
- \( z \) ranges from 0 to 1,
- For each \( z \), \( y \) ranges from 0 to \( 1 - z \),
- For each \( y \) and \( z \), \( x \) ranges from 0 to \( 1 - y - z \).

### Step 2: Set up the integral
The integral becomes:

\[
\int_{z=0}^1 \int_{y=0}^{1-z} \int_{x=0}^{1-y-z} \frac{dx \, dy \, dz}{(1 + x + y + z)^3}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the innermost integral (with respect to \( x \))
Let \( t = 1 + x + y + z \). Then \( dt = dx \), and when \( x = 0 \), \( t = 1 + y + z \), and when \( x = 1 - y - z \), \( t = 2 \). The innermost integral becomes:

\[
\int_{t=1+y+z}^2 \frac{dt}{t^3} = \left[ -\frac{1}{2t^2} \right]_{1+y+z}^2 = \frac{1}{2(1+y+z)^2} - \frac{1}{8}.
\]

### Step 4: Compute the next integral (with respect to \( y \))
Substitute the result of the innermost integral into the middle integral:

\[
\int_{z=0}^1 \int_{y=0}^{1-z} \left( \frac{1}{2(1+y+z)^2} - \frac{1}{8} \right) dy \, dz.
\]

Split this into two terms:

\[
I = I_1 - I_2,
\]

where:

\[
I_1 = \int_{z=0}^1 \int_{y=0}^{1-z} \frac{1}{2(1+y+z)^2} \, dy \, dz,
\]
\[
I_2 = \int_{z=0}^1 \int_{y=0}^{1-z} \frac{1}{8} \, dy \, dz.
\]

### Step 5: Compute \( I_2 \)
The integral \( I_2 \) is straightforward:

\[
I_2 = \int_{z=0}^1 \frac{1}{8} \int_{y=0}^{1-z} dy \, dz = \int_{z=0}^1 \frac{1}{8} (1 - z) \, dz.
\]

The inner integral is:

\[
\int_{z=0}^1 (1 - z) \, dz = \left[ z - \frac{z^2}{2} \right]_0^1 = 1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

Thus:

\[
I_2 = \frac{1}{8} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{16}.
\]

### Step 6: Compute \( I_1 \)
For \( I_1 \), make the substitution \( u = 1 + y + z \
