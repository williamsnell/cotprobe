Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. Hmm, it's about a hoist raising a load and calculating the horsepower. Alright, I remember that horsepower is a unit of power, and power is related to work done over time.

The problem says the hoist raises a 330-pound load a distance of 15 feet in 5 seconds. I need to find the rate in horsepower. Right, power is work divided by time. But wait, I think the formula involves force, distance, and time. Oh right, power equals force multiplied by distance divided by time. But wait, I have to make sure about the units because horsepower has specific units.

So first, the force here is the weight of the load, which is 330 pounds. But wait, in physics, when we talk about force, we usually use Newtons, but here we're dealing with pounds, which is a unit of force in the imperial system. But I think when calculating horsepower, the formula might already account for the conversion. Let me think.

I recall that 1 horsepower is approximately 550 foot-pounds per second. Oh wait, because that's the definition. So the formula for horsepower is (force in pounds * distance in feet) / (time in seconds) divided by 550. Because 550 ft-lbf/s equals 1 hp.

So putting in the numbers: force is 330 pounds, distance 15 feet, time 5 seconds. Let me write that out.

Power (hp) = (330 lb * 15 ft) / (5 s) / 550 (ft-lbf/s per hp)

Let me compute the numerator first. 330 * 15 is... let's see, 300*15 is 4500, and 30*15 is 450, so total is 4950. Then divide by 5, which is 990. So 990 divided by 550. Let me compute that.

990 divided by 550. Let's see, 550 goes into 990 once, giving 550, subtract that from 990, you get 440 left. Hmm, wait wait, maybe I should do it as a division. So 990 รท 550. 550 times 1 is 550, 550 times 1.8 is 990 because 550*1=550, 550*0.8=440. 550+440=990. Oh wait, so 1.8 times 550 is 990. So 990 divided by 550 is 1.8.

Wait, so the power is 1.8 horsepower? Looking at the options, option C is 1.8 hp. So that should be the answer.

Let me double-check my steps. Force is 330 lb, distance 15 ft, time 5s. So (330 *15 /5 ) = 330*3 =990 ft-lbs. Then, 990 /550 = approx 1.8. Yep. So option C.
</think>

To determine the horsepower (hp) at which the hoist is working, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Power (hp)} = \frac{\text{Force (lb)} \times \text{Distance (ft)}}{\text{Time (s)} \times 550}
\]

Here, the force is 330 pounds, the distance is 15 feet, and the time is 5 seconds. Plugging in the values:

\[
\text{Power (hp)} = \frac{330 \times 15}{5 \times 550}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
330 \times 15 = 4950
\]

Then divide by the time:

\[
\frac{4950}{5} = 990
\]

Now divide by 550 to convert to horsepower:

\[
\frac{990}{550} = 1.8
\]

Thus, the hoist is working at a rate of **1.8 horsepower**. The correct answer is:

C: 1.8 hp
