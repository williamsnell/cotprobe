Question:

How are whales adapted for their life in cold waters?

Options:

A: Whales have a specialized gill system to regulate temperature.
B: Whales are cold-blooded and adjust their body temperature to the water temperature.
C: Whales have a thick fur coat to keep them warm.
D: Whales have a unique enzyme that prevents their body fluids from freezing.
E: Whales maintain a nearly constant internal body temperature and have a tremendous amount of subcutaneous fat serving an insulating function.
F: Whales possess an advanced circulatory system that directs warm blood to the skin surface.
G: Whales have expandable bladders that they fill with warm water to maintain body temperature.

Okay, so I've got this biology question about whales and how they're adapted to living in cold water. I'm a bit rusty on my marine biology, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking which option correctly describes the adaptation of whales to cold water environments. The options are A through G, each presenting a different mechanism.

First, I remember that whales are mammals, not fish. That's an important starting point. So they have characteristics similar to other mammals, like being warm-blooded. That means they maintain a constant body temperature, unlike fish which are ectothermic (cold-blooded), right?

Looking at option A: Whales have a specialized gill system to regulate temperature. Wait, no, whales don't have gills. They have blowholes and lungs, so they surface to breathe air. So A is incorrect.

Option B says whales are cold-blooded and adjust their body temp to the water. But since whales are mammals, they're warm-blooded. So B is wrong.

Option C suggests a thick fur coat. But whales don't have fur. They have a thick layer of blubber instead. So C is incorrect.

Option D talks about a unique enzyme to prevent freezing. I'm not sure, but I don't recall hearing about such an enzyme in whales. Maybe some fish have antifreeze proteins, but I'm not certain about whales having this. Might be D, but I'll keep it in mind.

Option E: Maintain a nearly constant internal temperature and have subcutaneous fat for insulation. Subcutaneous fat sounds like blubber, which I know whales have. This makes sense because blubber is a thick fat layer that insulates them in cold water. Plus, as mammals, they do maintain a constant body temperature. So E looks like a strong candidate.

Option F says they have a circulatory system that directs warm blood to the skin. That sounds a bit off. I think mammals, including whales, might have countercurrent heat exchange systems in their extremities to conserve heat. So maybe F isn't the best answer because it's more about conserving heat internally rather than directing warm blood to the skin.

Option G mentions expandable bladders filled with warm water. That doesn't ring a bell. I don't think whales have such a system. It sounds more like something a different animal might do, maybe some kind of thermoregulation, but not whales.

Putting it all together: Whales are warm-blooded (so E's first part fits), and they have blubber as insulation. E seems to be the correct answer.

Whales are mammals and therefore warm-blooded, maintaining a constant internal body temperature. They are adapted to cold water through a thick layer of subcutaneous fat, known as blubber, which provides insulation. This aligns with option E, which correctly describes these adaptations.

Answer: E
