Question:

A camper stranded in snowy weather loses heat by wind convection. The camper is packing emergency rations consisting of $58 \%$ sucrose, $31 \%$ fat, and $11 \%$ protein by weight. Using the data provided in Problem P4.32 and assuming the fat content of the rations can be treated with palmitic acid data and the protein content similarly by the protein data in Problem P4.32, how much emergency rations must the camper consume in order to compensate for a reduction in body temperature of $3.5 \mathrm{~K}$ ? Assume the heat capacity of the body equals that of water. Assume the camper weighs $67 \mathrm{~kg}$.

Options:

A: 55 g
B: 44 $\mathrm{~g}$
C: 40 g
D: 70 g
E: 30 g
F: 65 g
G: 35 $\mathrm{~g}$
H:  49 $\mathrm{~g}$

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a camper needing to eat emergency rations to compensate for heat loss. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

Alright, the problem states that the camper's body temperature drops by 3.5 K. Wait, wait—temperature in Kelvin? Oh right, because in such problems, the change in temperature (ΔT) is what matters. So whether it's Celsius or Kelvin, the change is the same. So a 3.5 K drop is like a 3.5°C drop.

The camper's weight is 67 kg, and the heat capacity of the body is the same as water. Oh, right, the specific heat capacity of water is 4186 J/(kg·K) or something like that. Wait, I remember it's approximately 4.186 kJ/(kg·K), which is 4186 J/(kg·K). So that's the number I'll use.

So first, I think I need to calculate the total heat loss from the camper's body. The formula for heat loss (Q) is Q = m * c * ΔT. M is mass, c is specific heat, ΔT is change in temperature.

Wait, but the camper's mass is given as 67 kg. So putting that in: Q = 67 kg * 4186 J/(kg·K) * 3.5 K. Let me calculate that. Hmm, 67*4186 is a big number. Let me see, 67 * 4000 is 268,000. But 4186 is 186 more than 4000. So 67 * 186 = let's see, 60*186=11,160 and 7*186=1,302. So 11,160 +1,302=12,462. So total is 268,000 +12,462 = 280,462 J. Then multiply by 3.5. Oh wait, that's not right. Wait, 4186 is per kg per K. So the 67 kg multiplied by 4186 gives the total heat capacity per K. Then multiplied by ΔT=3.5 K.

So 67 * 4186 = let's calculate that accurately. Let me do it step by step. 67 *4000=268,000. 67*186=12,462. So total 268,000 +12,462 = 280,462 J/K. Then ΔT=3.5 K, so 280,462 *3.5. Let me compute that. 280,462 *3 = 841,386, and 280,462 *0.5 =140,231. So total is 841,386 +140,231 =981,617 J. So approximately 981,617 Joules lost.

Now, the camper needs to compensate for this heat loss by consuming emergency rations. So the energy from the food must provide this amount of heat. So I need to calculate how much energy is released by the rations when metabolized and how much food is needed to get 981,617 J.

The rations have three components: sucrose, fat, and protein. Each has different energy content. From the problem statement, I'm supposed to refer to the data in Problem P4.32, but since I don't have that, I'll have to assume standard energy values. Wait, but the question probably expects me to know the energy per gram for each macronutrient.

Wait, in biochemistry, carbohydrates provide about 4 kcal per gram, proteins about 4 kcal/g, and fats about 9 kcal/g. But wait, sometimes the values are given in kilojoules. Let me get this straight. Let me recall:

Carbohydrates: approx 4 kcal/g = 16.7 kJ/g (since 1 kcal is 4.184 kJ)
Proteins: same as carbs, around 4 kcal/g → 16.7 kJ/g
Fats: about 9 kcal/g → 37.7 kJ/g

But wait, the question says that the fat content can be treated with palmitic acid data, and protein with protein data from Problem P4.32. Hmm, so maybe the values are different. Oh wait, perhaps in that problem, palmitic acid (a type of fat) and protein have specific energy values given. Since I don't have that data, I might need to proceed with standard values, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the question implies that I should know the values from P4.32. Maybe I should think about that.

Wait, perhaps in Problem P4.32, the energy per gram for each is given. Let me think, for example, palmitic acid (C16H32O2) has a molar mass of (16*16)+(32*1)+(2*16)=256+32+32=320 g/mol. The combustion reaction for palmitic acid would release a certain amount of energy. Similarly for proteins. But without knowing the exact values from P4.32, perhaps I should proceed with standard values, but maybe the question expects to use specific values.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem gives data in terms of energy per gram. Let me think. For example, if in P4.32, the energy from palmitic acid is, say, 39.3 kJ/g, and for protein, perhaps around 22.1 kJ/g. Or maybe different numbers. Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects to use the heat of combustion for each, but without knowing the exact numbers, it's hard.

Wait, perhaps I should proceed with the standard values as a starting point. So, for the rations:

Sucrose (carbs): 58% → 0.58g per gram of ration is sucrose.

Fat: 31% → 0.31g per gram is fat.

Protein: 11% → 0.11g per gram is protein.

Each of these contributes energy when metabolized. So for each gram of ration, the energy is:

E = (0.58 g * energy per g of sucrose) + (0.31 g * energy per g of fat) + (0.11 g * energy per g of protein).

So if I can get the energy per gram for each, I can compute E per gram of ration, then find out how many grams needed to reach 981,617 J.

But the question says to treat fat as palmitic acid and protein as in P4.32. Let me think, perhaps in P4.32, the energy content is given as, for example, 39 kJ/g for fat and 20 kJ/g for protein. Wait, but without knowing, I'm stuck. Alternatively, perhaps the data is as follows: in P4.32, the energy for palmitic acid is 39.3 kJ/g, and for protein, 22.1 kJ/g. I remember sometimes seeing these numbers in problems, so maybe that's what I should use.

So, assuming:

Sucrose (carbs): 16.7 kJ/g

Palmitic acid (fat): 39.3 kJ/g

Protein: 22.1 kJ/g.

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to use 4 kcal/g for carbs and protein, which is 16.7 kJ/g, and 9 kcal/g for fat, which is 37.7 kJ/g. Maybe that's the way to go.

Wait, but the question says to use the data from P4.32, so perhaps I should use the values from that problem. Let me think—wait, in some textbooks, for example, the energy released from combustion of palmitic acid is about 39.3 kJ/g, and for egg albumin (a protein), it's about 23.9 kJ/g. But I'm not sure if that's accurate.

Alternatively, I've heard that metabolizable energy for the body is a bit less than the combustion energy because some energy is lost. For example, fats might be about 37 kJ/g, carbs 16.7, proteins about 16.7 as well, but sometimes protein is lower. Wait, but that's for metabolizable energy, which is what the body can use. So perhaps the problem expects to use these standard values.

Wait, let's proceed with the standard metabolizable energy values:

Carbohydrates: 16.7 kJ/g

Protein: 16.7 kJ/g

Fats: 37.7 kJ/g.

So, each gram of ration consists of:

0.58 g carbs → 0.58 *16.7 = ?

0.31 g fat → 0.31 *37.7 = ?

0.11 g protein → 0.11 *16.7 = ?

Let me compute each part.

Carbs: 0.58 *16.7 = Let's compute 0.5*16.7=8.35, 0.08*16.7≈1.336. So total ≈8.35 +1.336=9.686 kJ/g.

Fats: 0.31 *37.7 = 0.3*37.7=11.31, 0.01*37.7=0.377 → total ≈11.31 +0.377=11.687 kJ/g.

Protein: 0.11 *16.7 = 1.837 kJ/g.

Adding these together: 9.686 +11.687 +1.837 = let's add them step by step.

9.686 +11.687 = 21.373. Then +1.837 = 23.21 kJ per gram of rations.

Wait, so each gram of emergency rations provides about 23.21 kJ of energy.

Wait, but wait—did I make a mistake in the calculations? Let me check:

Carbs: 0.58 *16.7 = ?

Let me compute 16.7 *0.58:

16.7 *0.5 =8.35

16.7 *0.08=1.336

Sum: 8.35 +1.336=9.686 kJ.

Yes.

Fats: 0.31 *37.7.

0.3 *37.7=11.31

0.01 *37.7=0.377

Sum: 11.31 +0.377=11.687 kJ.

Proteins: 0.11 *16.7=1.837 kJ.

Total: 9.686 +11.687=21.373 → +1.837=23.21 kJ/g.

So each gram of rations gives 23.21 kJ.

But wait, how much energy does the camper need? 981,617 J, which is 981.617 kJ.

So the total energy needed is 981.617 kJ.

So the amount of rations needed (m) is total energy needed divided by energy per gram.

m = 981.617 kJ / 23.21 kJ/g ≈ let's compute that.

23.21 times 42 is 975.02 (since 23.21*40=928.4, 23.21*2=46.42 → 928.4 +46.42=974.82). So 42 grams would give about 974.82 kJ. The needed is 981.617, which is 981.617 -974.82=6.797 kJ more.

So 42 grams gives 974.82 kJ, so 6.797 kJ more needed. Since each gram gives 23.21 kJ, 6.797 /23.21 ≈ 0.293 grams. So total is 42.293 grams, approximately 42.3 grams.

Looking at the options, option B is 44g, which is close. But let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate more accurately.

Compute m = 981.617 /23.21.

Let me compute 23.21 *42 = 23.21*(40 +2) = 23.21*40=928.4, 23.21*2=46.42 → 928.4 +46.42=974.82.

Difference: 981.617 -974.82=6.797 kJ.

So 6.797 /23.21 = approximately 0.293 grams. So total is 42.293 grams, about 42.3 grams.

But none of the options exactly match 42.3. The options are:

A:55, B:44, C:40, D:70, E:30, F:65, G:35, H:49, I:25, J:60.

Hmm, closest would be option B:44g or C:40g. Wait, but 42.3 is between 40 and 44.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the energy per gram. Let me double-check the computations.

Alternatively, perhaps I used the wrong energy values. Because if I used 39.3 kJ/g for fat and 22.1 for protein, the energy per gram of rations would be higher.

Wait, let's try that. Maybe the question expects me to use 39.3 for fat and 22.1 for protein.

So, let's recalculate the energy per gram of rations:

Carbs: 0.58 g *16.7 kJ/g = 9.686 kJ.

Fat: 0.31 g *39.3 kJ/g = let's compute that. 0.3 *39.3 =11.79, 0.01 *39.3=0.393 → total 12.183 kJ.

Protein: 0.11 g *22.1 kJ/g = 0.11 *22.1 =2.431 kJ.

So total per gram: 9.686 +12.183 +2.431 = 24.3 kJ.

Wait, 9.686 +12.183 =21.869 +2.431=24.3 kJ/g.

So energy per gram is 24.3 kJ/g.

So total energy needed:981.617 kJ.

So m=981.617 /24.3 ≈ let's compute.

24.3 *40=972.

So 40 grams gives 972 kJ. The needed is 981.617, so 981.617 -972=9.617 kJ.

So 9.617 /24.3 ≈0.396 grams. So total m≈40.396 grams, about 40.4 grams.

Looking at the options, option C is 40g, which is very close. So that would be the answer.

Wait, but I'm getting two different values based on which energy values I use. Hmm, this is confusing.

But the problem statement says to use the data from P4.32, which I'm assuming provides specific values. If P4.32 gives the energy content as, say, 24.3 kJ/g for the rations, then 40g would be the correct answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I should check the exact energy values from P4.32. Wait, perhaps I can remember that in some textbooks, palmitic acid releases about 39.8 kJ/g and protein about 22.1 kJ/g. So let me try that.

So:

Carbs: 0.58 *16.7 =9.686 kJ.

Fat: 0.31 *39.8 = let's compute. 0.3*39.8=11.94, 0.01*39.8=0.398 → total 12.338 kJ.

Protein: 0.11 *22.1=2.431 kJ.

Sum: 9.686 +12.338 =21.024 +2.431=23.455 kJ/g.

So 23.455 kJ/g.

Total m=981.617 /23.455 ≈ let's compute.

23.455 *41 = let's see, 23.455*40=937.2, 23.455*1=23.455 → total 937.2 +23.455=960.655 kJ.

That's 41 grams. The needed is 981.617, so 981.617 -960.655=20.962 kJ.

20.962 /23.455 ≈0.894 grams. So m≈41.894 grams, about 41.9g. That's close to 42g, but the options don't have that. The closest is option B:44g or C:40g.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute more accurately.

981.617 ÷23.455 = let's compute.

23.455 *41 =23.455*40=937.2, plus 23.455 → total 960.655.

981.617 -960.655=20.962 left.

20.962 /23.455 ≈0.894.

So total is 41.894 grams, about 41.9g. So closest to 42g, but the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier. Let me check.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the energy per gram using the correct values from P4.32, but without knowing them, it's tricky.

Wait, perhaps another approach is to calculate how much each component contributes to the total energy, then find the total.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to compute the heat required, then find the energy from each gram of ration, then compute the grams needed.

Wait, I think the confusion arises from which energy values to use. Since the problem refers to P4.32, perhaps I should remember that in that problem, the energy content for palmitic acid is 39.8 kJ/g and for protein, 22.1 kJ/g. Let's try that again.

So:

Carbs:58% by weight → 0.58 g per gram of ration.

Energy from carbs: 0.58 g *16.7 kJ/g =9.686 kJ.

Fats:31% →0.31g *39.8 kJ/g=12.338 kJ.

Proteins:11% →0.11g *22.1 kJ/g=2.431 kJ.

Total per gram:9.686 +12.338 +2.431 =24.455 kJ/g.

Wait, that's 24.455 kJ per gram of ration.

So m=981.617 kJ /24.455 kJ/g ≈ let's compute.

24.455 *40=978.2 kJ.

So 40g gives 978.2 kJ.

The needed is 981.617, so 981.617 -978.2=3.417 kJ left.

3.417 /24.455≈0.14 grams.

So total m≈40.14 grams, so about 40.1
