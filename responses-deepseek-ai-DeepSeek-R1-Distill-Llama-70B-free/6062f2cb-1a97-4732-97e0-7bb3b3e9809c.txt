Okay, so I've got this economics question here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

The question says: Suppose that current disposable income is $10,000 and consumption spending is $8,000. For every $100 increase in disposable income, saving increases by $10. The question is about finding the correct option regarding marginal propensity to save or consume.

Hmm, I remember that marginal propensity to save (MPS) is the fraction of additional income that a household saves rather than consumes. Similarly, marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is the fraction spent. I think they add up to 1 because any extra income is either saved or consumed.

Wait, the question gives that for every $100 increase in disposable income, saving increases by $10. So, if income goes up by $100, saving goes up by $10. That means MPS is 10/100, which is 0.10. So MPS is 0.10. Then, MPC would be 1 - 0.10 = 0.90.

But wait, let me make sure. The question doesn't directly give the current saving, but it gives current disposable income and consumption. Disposable income Y is $10,000, consumption C is $8,000. So current saving S must be Y - C, which is $2,000. So S = $2,000.

But the question is about the marginal propensity, not the current levels. So what changes when income changes. So if income increases by $100, saving increases by $10. So yes, MPS is 0.10.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option C says MPS is 0.20. That's not right. Option H is MPS 0.10. So that's correct.

Now, looking at MPC. Since MPS is 0.10, MPC must be 0.90. So any option stating MPC is 0.90 would be correct if it were an option. Let me check the options.

Option D is MPC 0.20窶馬o. Option F is MPC 0.10窶馬o. Option G is MPC 0.70窶馬o. Option I is MPC 0.80窶馬o. So the correct options are H (MPS 0.10) and none for MPC 0.90 except if such an option exists. Wait, looking again:

The options are A through J. The given options are:

A: MPS 0.80

B: MPS 0.90

C: MPS 0.20

D: MPC 0.20

E: MPS 0.50

F: MPC 0.10

G: MPC 0.70

H: MPS 0.10

I: MPC 0.80

So the correct MPS is H, 0.10. And the MPC would be 0.90, but that's not one of the options. So the correct answer is H.

Wait, but let me double-check. The question says, "For every $100 increase in disposable income, saving increases by $10." So yes, that's MPS = 10/100 = 0.10. So H is correct.

Alternatively, sometimes people might confuse average propensity to save with marginal. Average propensity to save is S/Y, which here is 2000/10000 = 0.20. But that's not what's being asked. The question is about the marginal propensity, so H is right.

So looking at the options, the correct choice is H. So the answer is H.

The question asks about the marginal propensity to save (MPS) and consume (MPC) based on the given information. The data provided indicates that for every $100 increase in disposable income, saving increases by $10. This directly implies that the MPS is $10/$100 = 0.10. Since MPS + MPC = 1, the MPC would be 1 - 0.10 = 0.90. However, the question specifically focuses on MPS.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A (MPS = 0.80):** Incorrect, as MPS is 0.10.
- **Option B (MPS = 0.90):** Incorrect, as MPS is 0.10.
- **Option C (MPS = 0.20):** Incorrect, as MPS is 0.10.
- **Option D (MPC = 0.20):** Incorrect, as MPC is 0.90.
- **Option E (MPS = 0.50):** Incorrect, as MPS is 0.10.
- **Option F (MPC = 0.10):** Incorrect, as MPC is 0.90.
- **Option G (MPC = 0.70):** Incorrect, as MPC is 0.90.
- **Option H (MPS = 0.10):** Correct, as MPS is 0.10.
- **Option I (MPC = 0.80):** Incorrect, as MPC is 0.90.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option H**, as it accurately reflects the MPS of 0.10.

Answer: H
