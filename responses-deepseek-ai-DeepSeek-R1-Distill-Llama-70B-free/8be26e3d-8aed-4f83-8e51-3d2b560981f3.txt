Okay, I'm trying to solve this quantum mechanics problem about an electron in a box. Hmm, the question is about finding the wavelength of light needed to excite an electron from the ground state to the second excited state, and then the wavelength emitted when it falls from the second excited to the first excited state.

Wait, I remember that the energy levels in a particle in a box are quantized. The formula for the energy levels is E_n = (n² h²) / (8 m L²), where n is the quantum number, h is Planck's constant, m is the mass of the electron, and L is the width of the box.

The box is 0.2 nanometers, which is 0.2e-9 meters. The ground state is n=1, first excited is n=2, and second excited is n=3.

First part: excitation from n=1 to n=3. The energy difference would be E3 - E1. Then, the energy of the absorbed photon would be this difference, and from that, we can find the wavelength using E = hc/λ.

Wait, h is Planck's constant, which is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. The mass of the electron is about 9.109e-31 kg. Speed of light c is 3.0e8 m/s.

Let me compute E3 and E1.

E_n = (n² h²) / (8 m L²)

So E1 = (1² * h²) / (8 m L²)
E3 = (3² * h²) / (8 m L²) = 9 E1.

So the energy difference ΔE1 = E3 - E1 = 8 E1.

Wait, but let me compute E1 first.

Plugging in the numbers:

h = 6.626e-34
m = 9.109e-31 kg
L = 0.2e-9 m.

E1 = (1 * (6.626e-34)^2) / (8 * 9.109e-31 * (0.2e-9)^2 )

Let me compute each part step by step.

Compute numerator: (6.626e-34)^2 = (6.626)^2 * 1e-68. 6.626 squared is about 43.9, so 43.9e-68 = 4.39e-67.

Denominator: 8 * 9.109e-31 kg * (0.2e-9)^2.

(0.2e-9)^2 = 0.04e-18 m² = 4e-20 m².

So denominator is 8 * 9.109e-31 * 4e-20.

Compute 8 *9.109e-31: 8 *9.109 is about 72.87, so 72.87e-31.

Multiply by 4e-20: 72.87e-31 *4e-20 = 291.48e-51 = 2.9148e-49.

So E1 = 4.39e-67 / 2.9148e-49.

Wait, 4.39e-67 / 2.91e-49 = (4.39 / 2.91) * 1e-18.

4.39 /2.91 is approximately 1.508. So E1≈1.508e-18 J.

Then ΔE1 between n=3 and n=1 is 8 * E1 = 8 * 1.508e-18 = 1.2064e-17 J.

Now, the energy of the photon needed is ΔE = hc/λ → λ = hc/ΔE.

Compute hc: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

So λ = 1.9878e-25 / 1.2064e-17 = (1.9878 / 1.2064) * 1e-8.

1.9878 /1.2064 ≈ 1.648. So 1.648e-8 meters is 16.48e-9 meters, which is 16.48 nanometers.

Wait, but the options don't have exactly 16.48. Looking at the options for the first part, the first numbers are:

A:14.5, B:19.5, C:15.5, D:20.5, E:22.5, F:13.5, G:18.5, H:21.5, I:16.5, J:17.5.

Hmm, I got approximately 16.48 nm for the absorption. The closest option is I:16.510 nm, but wait, perhaps I made an approximation error.

Wait, perhaps I should be more precise with the calculations.

Let me redo E1 more accurately.

Compute numerator: h² = (6.62607015e-34)^2. Let's calculate it accurately.

6.62607015e-34 squared: 6.62607015² = approx 43.9. So 43.9e-68 → 4.39e-67 J²·s².

Denominator: 8 * m * L².

m = 9.10938356e-31 kg.

L = 0.2e-9 m. So L² = (0.2e-9)^2 = 4e-20 m².

So denominator is 8 * 9.10938356e-31 * 4e-20.

Compute 8 *9.10938e-31 = 72.8750688e-31 kg.

Multiply by 4e-20 m²: 72.8750688e-31 *4e-20 = 291.5002752e-51 kg·m².

So denominator is 2.915002752e-49 kg·m².

So E1 = (4.39e-67 J²·s² ) / (2.915e-49 kg·m² ) → E1 = (4.39 / 2.915) * 1e-18 J.

4.39 /2.915 ≈ 1.507 → so E1≈1.507e-18 J.

Then ΔE = E3 - E1 = (9-1) E1 =8 *1.507e-18 =1.2056e-17 J.

Now, computing λ: hc/ΔE.

h=6.62607015e-34 J·s, c=299792458 m/s. Let's use exact values for better precision.

But perhaps for simplicity, I'll proceed with 6.626e-34 and 3e8.

hc =6.626e-34 * 3e8 =1.9878e-25 J·m.

So λ =1.9878e-25 /1.2056e-17 = (1.9878 / 1.2056) * 1e-8 m.

1.9878 /1.2056 ≈ 1.648 → 1.648e-8 m is 16.48 nm.

So the first wavelength is approximately 16.48 nm. Looking at the options, option I's first value is 16.510 nm. Close, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in the exact calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider more precise values.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the energy levels using exact formula and then see.

Wait another approach: the energy levels for a particle in a box are given by E_n = (n² h²) / (8 m_e L²), where m_e is the electron mass.

But perhaps using Rydberg units or something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the energy difference using the formula ΔE = (Δn²) (h²/(8m_e L²)).

Wait, the energy difference between n_initial and n_final is:

ΔE = (n_final² - n_initial²) * (h²/(8 m_e L²)).

So for the first case, from n=1 to n=3: Δn² =9-1=8.

So ΔE1 =8 * (h²/(8 m_e L²))= (h²/(m_e L²))*(8)/(8) → (h²)/(m_e L²) → wait no: because (n² - m²) is 8, so 8 is multiplied by (h²/(8 m_e L^2)).

So, ΔE1 = 8 * (h²/(8 m_e L²)) )= h²/(m_e L²) * (8/(8 )) → h²/(m_e L²) * 1.

Wait, that can't be right. Let me re-calculate.

Wait, (n_final² - n_initial²) = 3^2 -1^2=9-1=8.

So ΔE1 = [8] * [h²/(8 m_e L²)] = (8 * h²) / (8 m_e L²) )= h²/(m_e L²).

So ΔE1 = h²/(m_e L²).

Wait, then compute h²/(m_e L²).

h =6.626e-34 J·s

m_e=9.109e-31 kg

L=0.2e-9 m.

h² = (6.626e-34)^2 = approx 4.39e-67 J²s².

m_e L² =9.109e-31 kg * (0.2e-9 m)^2 =9.109e-31 *4e-20 =3.6436e-50 kg m².

So h²/(m_e L²) =4.39e-67 /3.6436e-50 =1.206e-17 J. So same as before.

Thus, ΔE1=1.206e-17 J.

Then λ1= h c /ΔE1.

h=6.626e-34, c=3e8 m/s.

hc=1.9878e-25 Jm.

So λ1=1.9878e-25 /1.206e-17 = approx 1.648e-8 m → 16.48 nm.

So the first part's answer should be about 16.48 nm. Looking at the options, option I is 16.510 nm, and option J is 17.510 nm. Hmm, perhaps I made a miscalculation in constants; maybe using more precise values would bring it closer.

Wait, let me compute the exact value of h²/(m_e L²):

h =6.62607015e-34 J·s

h²= (6.62607015e-34)^2 = let me calculate that accurately.

6.62607015^2 = let me compute 6.62607^2: 6 *6=36, 6*0.62607=3.756, 0.62607*6=3.756, 0.62607^2≈0.3915. So total: (6+0.62607)^2 = 6² + 2*6*0.62607 + (0.62607)^2 ≈36 +7.5248 +0.3915≈43.9163. So h²≈43.9163e-68 → 4.39163e-67 J² s².

m_e L²: 9.10938356e-31 kg * (0.2e-9 m)^2 =9.10938356e-31 *4e-20 =3.64375342e-50 kg m².

h²/(m_e L²)=4.39163e-67 /3.64375342e-50 = (4.39163 /3.64375342) *1e-17 → approximately 1.2055 *1e-17 →1.2055e-17 J.

So ΔE1=1.2055e-17 J.

Then, λ1=hc/ΔE1= (6.62607015e-34 *299792458) /1.2055e-17.

Calculate numerator: 6.62607015e-34 *3e8 =1.9878e-25 J m.

But more accurately, 6.62607015e-34 *2.99792458e8 = let me compute this.

6.62607015 *2.99792458 ≈ let's compute 6 *3=18, but accurately:

6.62607015 *2.99792458:

Approximate to 6.626 *3 =19.878, but subtract a small amount because 2.9979 is slightly less than 3.

Wait, 3 -2.99792458=0.00207542.

So 6.62607015 *0.00207542= approximately 0.01375.

So 6.62607015 *2.99792458≈19.878 -0.01375=19.86425.

So 19.86425e-26 → 1.986425e-25 J·m.

Wait, wait, no: 6.626e-34 *3e8 is 1.9878e-25, yes. So more accurately, 6.62607015e-34 *299792458 = (6.62607015 *2.99792458)e-26.

Wait, 6.62607015 *2.99792458 = let me compute that accurately.

Calculate 6 *2.99792458 =17.98754748
0.62607015 *2.99792458≈

0.6 *2.99792458=1.79875475
0.02607015 *2.99792458≈≈0.0781.

Total: 1.79875475 +0.0781=1.87685.

So total 6.62607015 *2.99792458≈17.98754748 +1.8768548≈19.864402.

So h c =19.864402e-26 J·m → 1.9864402e-25 J·m.

So λ1= 1.9864402e-25 / 1.2055e-17 → 1.9864402 /1.2055 = approx 1.648 → 1.648e-8 m →16.48e-9 m →16.48 nm.

Looking back at the options, option I is 16.510 nm, which is very close. But wait, why the slight discrepancy? Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the energy difference.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the energy levels are E_n = (n² h²)/(8 m L²). So the energy difference between n=3 and n=1 is E3 - E1 = (9 -1)(h²/(8 m L²))=8*(h²/(8 m L²))=h²/(m L²).

Wait, that's the same as I did before. So that's correct.

So the first wavelength is approximately 16.48 nm. The closest option is I:16.510 nm. Or option J is 17.510 nm, which is a bit further. But perhaps my approximation of the constants is causing the difference.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use exact values for h and m_e.

Wait, h is 6.62607015e-34 J·s exactly.

m_e is 9.1093837015e-31 kg.

L is exactly 0.2e-9 m.

Let me compute E1 precisely.

E1 = h²/(8 m_e L²).

Wait, E1 = (h²) / (8 m_e L²).

So compute denominator: 8 * m_e * L².

m_e=9.1093837015e-31 kg.

L=0.2e-9 m, so L²=4e-20 m².

Denominator: 8 *9.1093837015e-31 *4e-20 → 8 *9.1093837015e-31 =72.875069612e-31 → 7.2875069612e-30.

Multiply by 4e-20 →7.2875069612e-30 *4e-20 =2.9150027845e-49.

So denominator is 2.9150027845e-49.

h²: (6.62607015e-34)^2 =43.90577254e-68 →4.390577254e-67.

So E1 =4.390577254e-67 / 2.9150027845e-49 = (4.390577254 /2.9150027845) *1e-18 → approx 1.50677 *1e-18 J.

So E1≈1.50677e-18 J.

Then ΔE1 = E3 - E1 =8 E1 =8 *1.50677e-18=1.205416e-17 J.

Now, compute λ1 = hc/ΔE1.

h=6.62607015e-34, c=299792458 m/s.

Compute hc:6.62607015e-34 *299792458 = let me compute that.

6.62607015e-34 *2.99792458e8 = (6.62607015 *2.99792458) *1e-26.

6.62607015 *2.99792458≈19.86446.

So hc=19.86446e-26 J·m →1.986446e-25 J·m.

So λ1=1.986446e-25 /1.205416e-17 = (1.986446 /1.205416) *1e-8 m.

Compute 1.986446 /1.205416 → approximately 1.648.

So 1.648e-8 m is 16.48 nm.

Hmm, so the first wavelength is 16.480 nm. The options don't have that exact value, but option I is 16.510 nm, which is very close. So I think the correct first part is option I.

Now, the second part: the electron falls from the second excited state (n=3) to the first excited state (n=2). So energy difference is E3 - E2.

E2 = (2² h²)/(8 m_e L²) =4 E1.

E3 =9 E1.

So ΔE2 = E3 - E2 = (9 -4) E1 =5 E1 =5 *1.50677e-18=7.53385e-18 J.

So the energy emitted is 7.
