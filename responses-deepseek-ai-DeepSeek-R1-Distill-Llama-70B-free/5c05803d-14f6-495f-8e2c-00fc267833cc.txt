Okay, so I have this question about the Green Revolution and why it didn't help Africa much. Hmm, I remember that the Green Revolution was a big deal in places like Asia and Latin America, but Africa didn't benefit as much. Let me think about what I know.

The Green Revolution introduced high-yielding crop varieties, like wheat and maize, and used irrigation, fertilizers, and pesticides. But wait, in Africa, the main staple crops are different. Like, a lot of Africans rely on crops such as cassava, yams, and sorghum. If the Green Revolution focused on wheat and rice, which are more common in Asia, then maybe those weren't the crops Africans were growing. So the new seeds and methods might not have been suitable for their primary crops.

Looking at the options, option D says it targeted crops Africans don't grow and eat. That makes sense. If the revolution didn't focus on their staple crops, then the benefits wouldn't apply. Also, I think African soils might be different, but some options mention that. Option E says the technologies weren't compatible with African soil, but I'm not sure if that's the main reason. I think the primary issue was the crops themselves.

Wait, another point: the Green Revolution required things like irrigation systems and machinery. Maybe African farmers didn't have access to that, but I think the main reason is more about the crops. So D seems more accurate.

Another option is A, which says farmers weren't trained. That could be a factor, but I think the main issue was the crops. Also, option B says it required machinery, which might be true, but again, I think the crops were the bigger problem.

So I'm leaning towards D as the correct answer.

The Green Revolution primarily focused on crops like wheat and rice, which were not the staple crops in Africa. African farmers relied more on crops such as cassava, yams, and sorghum, which were not targeted by the Green Revolution. This mismatch in crop focus was a significant reason why the benefits of the Green Revolution were not realized in Africa.

Answer: D
