Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the concepts yet, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The problem is about calculating the number of photons in a light pulse. The given information is that the pulse has an energy of 2.00 millijoules (mJ) and a wavelength of 1.06 micrometers (μm). I need to find out how many photons are in this pulse from the options provided.

Hmm, I remember that the energy of a photon is related to its wavelength. Oh right, the formula E = hc/λ, where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and λ is the wavelength. But wait, that gives the energy per photon. Since we have the total energy of the pulse, I think I need to divide the total energy by the energy per photon to get the number of photons.

Let me jot down what I know:

Total energy (E_total) = 2.00 mJ. Oh wait, I should convert that to joules because the standard units for these constants are in meters, kg, etc. So 2 mJ is 2e-3 J, right?

Wavelength (λ) = 1.06 μm. That's micrometers, so I need to convert that to meters. 1 μm is 1e-6 meters, so 1.06 μm is 1.06e-6 meters.

Planck's constant (h) is 6.626e-34 J·s. And the speed of light (c) is approximately 3.00e8 m/s.

So the energy of one photon is E_photon = hc/λ.

Let me calculate that. Plugging in the numbers: (6.626e-34 J·s * 3e8 m/s) / 1.06e-6 m.

Wait, let me compute the numerator first. 6.626e-34 multiplied by 3e8 is... 6.626 *3 is about 19.878, and the exponents would be 1e-26 (since 1e-34 * 1e8 is 1e-26). So 19.878e-26 J·m, right?

Then divide by 1.06e-6 m. So 19.878e-26 / 1.06e-6.

Hmm, let me compute that. 19.878 divided by 1.06 is about 18.75. And the exponents: 1e-26 / 1e-6 = 1e-20. So E_photon is approximately 18.75e-20 J.

Wait, no, wait. Let me check that calculation again because I might have messed up the exponents. Let's see:

Numerator: (6.626e-34) * (3e8) = (6.626 * 3) * (1e-34 * 1e8) = 19.878e-26.

Denominator: 1.06e-6 m.

So E_photon = (19.878e-26 J·m) / (1.06e-6 m) ) = (19.878 / 1.06) * 1e-20 J.

19.878 divided by 1.06: Let me calculate that. 1.06 * 18 = 19.08. 19.08 + 0.8*1.06= 19.08 +0.848= 19.928, which is a bit over 19.878. So maybe 18.75?

Wait, 1.06 * 18 = 19.08. Subtract, 19.878 -19.08=0.798. 0.798 /1.06 ≈ 0.752. So it's 18.752. So approximately 18.75.

So E_photon ≈ 18.75e-20 J.

Wait, 18.75e-20 J is the same as 1.875e-19 J per photon.

Now, the total energy is 2e-3 J. So the number of photons N would be E_total / E_photon.

N = (2e-3 J) / (1.875e-19 J/photon) = (2 / 1.875) * 1e16 photons.

Wait, 2 divided by 1.875. Let's see, 1.875 is 15/8, so 2 divided by (15/8) is 2*(8/15)=16/15 ≈ 1.0667.

So N ≈ 1.0667e16 photons.

Looking at the options, let me check. Option B is 1.07e16, which is very close. Option E is 1.5e16, which is higher. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Recomputing the energy per photon:

h = 6.626e-34 J·s

c = 3e8 m/s

λ = 1.06e-6 m

E_photon = (6.626e-34 * 3e8) / 1.06e-6

Compute numerator: 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 1.9878e-25 J·m.

Wait, wait, no! Wait, 6.626e-34 * 3e8 = 6.626 *3 = 19.878, and the exponents: 1e-34 *1e8 = 1e-26. So 19.878e-26 J·m.

Divide by λ (1.06e-6 m): 19.878e-26 / 1.06e-6 = (19.878 / 1.06) * 1e-20.

19.878 / 1.06 ≈ 18.75, as before.

So E_photon = 18.75e-20 J = 1.875e-19 J.

Total energy is 2e-3 J.

Number of photons N = 2e-3 / 1.875e-19 = (2 / 1.875) * 1e16.

2 / 1.875 = 1.066666..., so N ≈ 1.066666e16.

Looking at the options, option B is 1.07e16, which matches this.

Wait, but I just noticed that the energy was given as 2.00 mJ, which is 2.00e-3 J, so precise. So my calculation is precise enough.

I think I might have gotten this right. So the answer should be option B.

To calculate the number of photons in a $2.00 \mathrm{~mJ}$ light pulse at a wavelength of $1.06 \mu \mathrm{m}$, we use the relationship between the energy of a photon and its wavelength: 

\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{hc}{\lambda}
\]

where:
- $h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \mathrm{~J \cdot s}$ (Planck's constant),
- $c = 3.00 \times 10^8 \mathrm{~m/s}$ (speed of light),
- $\lambda = 1.06 \mu \mathrm{m} = 1.06 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~m}$ (wavelength in meters).

### Step 1: Calculate the energy of one photon
\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{(6.626 \times 10^{-34}) (3.00 \times 10^8)}{1.06 \times 10^{-6}}
\]

First, compute the numerator:
\[
(6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \times (3.00 \times 10^8) = 1.9878 \times 10^{-25} \mathrm{~J \cdot m}.
\]

Now divide by the wavelength:
\[
E_{\text{photon}} = \frac{1.9878 \times 10^{-25}}{1.06 \times 10^{-6}} = 1.875 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{~J}.
\]

Thus, the energy of one photon is approximately $1.875 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{~J}$.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of photons
The total energy of the pulse is given as $2.00 \mathrm{~mJ} = 2.00 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~J}$. The number of photons $N$ is the total energy divided by the energy per photon:

\[
N = \frac{E_{\text{total}}}{E_{\text{photon}}}.
\]

Substitute the values:
\[
N = \frac{2.00 \times 10^{-3}}{1.875 \times 10^{-19}} = \frac{2.00}{1.875} \times 10^{16}.
\]

Simplify:
\[
N = 1.0667 \times 10^{16}.
\]

### Step 3: Match with the closest option
The calculated number of photons is approximately $1.07 \times 10^{16}$, which corresponds to **option B**.
