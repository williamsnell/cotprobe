Question:

Which statement about protein digestion and absorption is most correct?


Options:

A: The products of protein digestion may be absorbed as free amino acids or as di- or tripeptides
B: Gastric digestion of all proteins is equally efficient because of the grinding action of the antrum
C: Gastric zymogenic (chief) cells produce and secrete chymotrypsin, elastase and carboxypeptidase A and this initiates the process of protein digestion
D: The products of digestion of dietary protein by luminal and brush-border enzymes are only absorbed by one of the 14 different amino acid transporters

Okay, so I've got this question about protein digestion and absorption. Hmm, I remember from my bio class that proteins are broken down into smaller units like amino acids. Let me think through each option.

Option A says the products of protein digestion may be absorbed as free amino acids or di/tri peptides. I think that's right. Because I remember that most amino acids are absorbed as single units, but some can also come in as dipeptides or tripeptides. Those get broken down further in the cells before entering the bloodstream. So A might be correct.

Option B states that all proteins are equally digested because of the antrum's grinding. Wait, the antrum is part of the stomach, right? It doesn't really grind all proteins equally. Also, grinding is mechanical digestion, but proteins are mainly broken down by enzymes. Plus, some proteins might be resistant, like certain structures. So B doesn't sound right.

Option C says gastric chief cells produce chymotrypsin, elastase, and carboxypeptidase A. Wait, no, those enzymes are made in the pancreas, not the stomach. The chief cells in the stomach produce pepsinogen, which becomes pepsin. These other enzymes are pancreatic enzymes released into the small intestine. So C is incorrect.

Option D says the products are absorbed by one of 14 amino acid transporters. I think there are multiple transporters, each specific for different amino acids. But I'm not sure about 14 being the exact number. Also, the products include di/tri peptides, which are taken up by different transporters (like PepT1), so they aren't using the amino acid transporters. So D is probably wrong.

Putting it all together, A seems correct because it correctly states that absorption can be as amino acids or small peptides. The other options have inaccuracies. So I'll go with A.

The correct answer is:

**A: The products of protein digestion may be absorbed as free amino acids or as di- or tripeptides**

**Explanation:**

- **Option A** is correct because during protein digestion, proteins are broken down into smaller peptides and amino acids. Most of these are absorbed as free amino acids, but some di- and tripeptides are also absorbed and further broken down into amino acids within intestinal cells before entering the bloodstream.

- **Option B** is incorrect because the antrum's grinding action in the stomach is a mechanical process and does not equally affect all proteins. Additionally, the efficiency of protein digestion depends on enzymatic action, not just mechanical grinding.

- **Option C** is incorrect because chymotrypsin, elastase, and carboxypeptidase A are pancreatic enzymes, not products of gastric chief cells. Gastric chief cells produce pepsinogen, which is converted to pepsin in the stomach.

- **Option D** is incorrect because while multiple amino acid transporters exist, the exact number is not definitively 14. Furthermore, di- and tripeptides are absorbed via specific peptide transporters (e.g., PepT1), not amino acid transporters.

Thus, the most accurate statement is **A**.
