Okay, so I've got this question about the Buckley Amendment and what it establishes. I'm a bit rusty on this, so I need to think carefully. Let's see... I remember that there are several laws related to education and privacy, especially regarding students and their records.

The question gives options from A to I. The Buckley Amendment is probably related to one of these areas. I think FERPA might be involved here. FERPA stands for the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. Oh wait, I think FERPA is also known as the Buckley Amendment because it was introduced by Senator James Buckley. So that's a clue.

FERPA is all about the privacy of student education records. It gives parents and eligible students certain rights, like accessing the records, requesting changes, and consenting to disclosure of their records. So looking at the options, I need to find which one aligns with FERPA's provisions.

Option D says the right of parents or legal guardians to inspect the child’s school records. That sounds exactly like what FERPA does. It allows parents to look at their child's school records and also gives them the right to request corrections if they find something wrong. 

Let me check the other options just to be sure. Option B talks about medical records, which might be HIPAA instead. Option C mentions a free appropriate public education (FAPE), which is from the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Option E is about specialized instruction, which also sounds like IDEA. So those are different laws. 

Option A is about hospitals making modifications for disabilities, which is probably the ADA or Section 504. Option F is about employers and reasonable accommodations, again ADA. Options G and H are about patient access to records, which would be HIPAA. Option I is about modifying tests for job applicants with disabilities, which is ADA as well.

So the only option that relates to FERPA is D. The Buckley Amendment, being FERPA, gives parents the right to inspect their child's school records.

The Buckley Amendment, also known as the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), establishes the right of parents or legal guardians of a child to inspect the child’s school records. This law ensures privacy and transparency in educational records, allowing parents and eligible students to access and request corrections to these records. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option D** aligns with FERPA's provisions, as it directly addresses the right to inspect school records.
- Other options pertain to different laws, such as HIPAA (medical records), IDEA (special education), or ADA (disability accommodations), and are therefore incorrect.

Thus, the correct answer is:

D
