Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here about the combustion of benzene. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question gives me the reaction: C6H6(l) + 7.5 O2(g) → 6 CO2(g) + 3 H2O(l). I remember that combustion reactions are exothermic, so the enthalpy change (ΔH) should be negative. 

The problem states that when this combustion is carried out at 77°F, 18,000 Btu per pound of benzene is evolved. I need to calculate ΔH at 77°F per mole of benzene. Oh, and the molecular weight of benzene is given as 78.11 lb per lb-mole.

Wait, so the given energy is per pound of benzene, but I need to find it per mole. Right, because ΔH is usually expressed per mole of substance in chemical reactions.

So the plan is: take the energy per pound and multiply by the number of pounds per mole. Or wait, actually, since it's 18,000 Btu/lb, and each mole weighs 78.11 lb, then per mole it's 18,000 multiplied by 78.11.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, if I have one pound of benzene, that releases 18,000 Btu. So for one mole, which is 78.11 pounds, the total would be 18,000 times 78.11. But wait, no, that's not right. Because 1 mole is 78.11 lb, so to get per mole, you multiply the per-pound value by the molecular weight.

Wait, let's think again. If each pound gives off 18,000 Btu, then per mole (which is 78.11 lb), it's 18,000 * 78.11. That makes sense.

So the calculation would be 18,000 multiplied by 78.11. Let me do that math. 18,000 times 70 is 1,260,000. 18,000 times 8.11 is... let's see, 18,000 *8=144,000, and 18,000 *0.11=1,980, so total is 144,000 +1,980=145,980. Adding to 1,260,000, that's 1,405,980 Btu per mole. 

Wait, but wait, the options are in the order of 1.4e6, which is 1,400,000. So 1,405,980 is approximately 1.40598e6. Looking at the options, option B is -1.40598e6, and option J is -1.4075e6, which is a bit higher. Hmm, let me check the exact calculation.

18,000 *78.11. Let me compute this accurately. 18,000 times 78 is 1,404,000. 18,000 *0.11 is 1,980. So total is 1,404,000 +1,980=1,405,980. So that's 1,405,980 Btu per mole.

Wait, but wait a second. The question says the combustion evolves 18,000 Btu per pound. Since combustion is exothermic, the ΔH should be negative. So the ΔH is negative that value.

So ΔH_77°F = - (18,000 *78.11) = -1,405,980 Btu per mole.

Looking at the options, option B is -1.40598e6, which is -1,405,980. So that's exactly matching. So the correct answer should be B.

Wait, but let me double-check. Is the molecular weight correctly used? The problem gives 78.11 lb/lbmole. Oh, lb per lb-mole. So yes, molecular weight is 78.11 lb per mole, so one mole is 78.11 lb. So the calculation is correct.

So the answer should be option B.

To calculate the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the combustion of benzene at 77°F per mole, we start with the given data:

- Energy evolved per pound of benzene: **18,000 Btu/lb**
- Molecular weight of benzene: **78.11 lb/lbmole**

Since ΔH is expressed per mole of benzene, we multiply the energy per pound by the molecular weight:

\[
\Delta H = - (18,000 \, \text{Btu/lb}) \times (78.11 \, \text{lb/lbmole})
\]

Performing the calculation:

\[
\Delta H = - (18,000 \times 78.11) = -1,405,980 \, \text{Btu/lbmole}
\]

This matches the value **-1.40598 × 10⁶ Btu/lbmole**, which corresponds to **option B**. The negative sign indicates that the reaction is exothermic, as expected for a combustion process.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**B: -1.40598 × 10⁶ Btu/lbmole**

Answer: B
