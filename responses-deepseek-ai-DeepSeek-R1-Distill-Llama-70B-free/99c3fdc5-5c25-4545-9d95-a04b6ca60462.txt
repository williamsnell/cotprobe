Okay, so I have this question about Alzheimer's disease risk factors, and I need to figure out which option is associated with a decreased risk. Let's go through each option one by one.

The question is asking which factor decreases the risk, so I'm looking for something that's protective or has a negative correlation with Alzheimer's.

Option A: Being African or Hispanic American. I remember reading that some ethnic groups have higher risks. I think African Americans and Hispanics might have a higher incidence, so this might not be a decreased risk factor. So probably not A.

Option B: Lower level of education. I think higher education is linked to lower risk because it builds cognitive reserve. So lower education would be a risk factor, not protective. So B is probably not the answer.

Option C: Living in a city. Hmm, not sure about this. Urban vs ruralâ€”maybe access to healthcare or lifestyle factors, but I don't recall this being a major factor. I think other factors are more significant, so maybe C isn't the right choice.

Option D: Being married. I think social engagement is good for the brain. Married people might have more social interaction, which could lower the risk. So D could be a possible answer.

Option E: Family history of Alzheimer's. Definitely a risk factor. If you have a family history, your risk is higher. So E is not the answer.

Option F: High intake of saturated fats. Saturated fats are usually bad for heart health, and since there's a link between heart health and Alzheimer's, this might increase risk. So F is probably not the answer.

Option G: Older age. This is a major risk factor. The older you get, the higher the risk. So G isn't the answer.

Option H: Eating fish. Fish has omega-3 fatty acids, which are good for the brain. I've heard that diets high in fish, like the Mediterranean diet, are associated with lower Alzheimer's risk. So H might be the correct answer.

Option I: Being a smoker. Smoking is bad for the brain and increases dementia risk. So I isn't the answer.

Option J: Drinking alcohol regularly. I think moderate alcohol consumption might have a protective effect, but heavy drinking is bad. So maybe J is a possible answer, but I'm not as sure as H.

So, considering all options, H (eating fish) and D (being married) seem like potential answers. Between them, I think H is more directly related to dietary factors known to reduce risk. Social factors like marriage might help, but the evidence for diet is stronger. So I'll go with H.

The correct answer is H: Eating fish. 

Eating fish, which is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, has been associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease. This dietary factor is supported by research showing that diets high in fish, such as the Mediterranean diet, contribute to better brain health and lower Alzheimer's risk. 

Answer: H
