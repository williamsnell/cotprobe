Question:

A city entered into a small-cost construction contract with a construction company whereby the latter obligated themselves to perform certain minor sewer repair work. Two months after completion of the work, the company sued the city for its failure to pay under the terms of the contract. At trial, the company's construction supervisor who personally oversaw all the repair work was called to testify. He sought to testify about the amount of sewer pipe used, the number of hours required to complete the job, and the number of workers employed by the company during the construction repair work. The defendant's attorney objected on the grounds that the company routinely recorded such factual information in their log books, which were in the company's possession. As a consequence, the supervisor's testimony should be ruled

Options:

A: inadmissible, because such testimony would be violative of the best evidence rule.
B: inadmissible, because no evidence was introduced to show that the original log records are not available for examination.
C: admissible, because it is relevant to the case.
D: admissible, because the supervisor is a credible witness.
E: admissible, because it is based on firsthand knowledge.
F: inadmissible, because it would be hearsay evidence.
G: inadmissible, because the information is not relevant to the case.
H: admissible, because the supervisor was directly involved in the construction work.
I: admissible, because it is a report of regularly conducted business activities.
J: inadmissible, because the supervisor was not under oath when the information was recorded.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically dealing with the best evidence rule. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is a city that contracted a construction company for some minor sewer repairs. The company finished the work and then sued the city for non-payment. At trial, the company's supervisor wants to testify about certain facts: the amount of sewer pipe used, the hours required, and the number of workers. The defense objects, saying the company keeps log books with this info, which are in their possession. So they argue the supervisor's testimony should be inadmissible.

I remember that the best evidence rule, which is part of the Federal Rules of Evidence, generally says that to prove the content of a writing, recording, or photograph, the original is required. So if someone is testifying about something that's recorded in a document, the document itself should be produced unless certain exceptions apply.

Here, the supervisor is testifying about specific details that the company regularly records in log books. So the defense is arguing that under the best evidence rule, those log books should be produced instead of the supervisor testifying about it.

Looking at the options now. Option A says it's inadmissible because it violates the best evidence rule. But wait, I think there's an exception when the original isn't available. Oh, but in this case, the log books are in the company's possession. So they are available. So the supervisor can't testify about the content unless the logs are produced.

Option B says inadmissible because no evidence was introduced that the original logs aren't available. Hmm, but in this scenario, the logs are available because they're with the company. So the supervisor's testimony is trying to replace the logs, which should be produced. So B seems to be the correct reasoning because without showing the logs are unavailable, the testimony shouldn't be allowed.

Wait, no. Wait, the situation is that the company has the logs, so they are available. Therefore, the testimony about the contents without producing the logs would violate the best evidence rule. So the issue is that the logs are available, so the testimony shouldn't be allowed. So the objection is that they have the logs, so the testimony is hearsay? Or is it about the best evidence rule?

Wait, the best evidence rule applies when a party is trying to prove the content of a writing. So if the supervisor is testifying about the number of pipes used, which is recorded in the log, then the log should be produced. So the testimony is secondary evidence, which isn't allowed unless the original is unavailable.

So the options: Option A says it's inadmissible under best evidence. Option B says inadmissible because no evidence the logs are unavailable. Wait, but the logs are available. So the testimony is inadmissible because the logs exist and should be used. So option A would apply because the best evidence rule requires the logs, making the testimony inadmissible.

But wait, the supervisor is testifying from his own knowledge. Does the best evidence rule even apply here? Because if he's testifying based on his personal knowledge—like he remembers how many workers were there—then it's not about the log's content but his own memory. Hmm, that's a different point. The best evidence rule applies when the content of a document is at issue. If the witness is relying on personal knowledge, not the document, then it's okay.

Wait, the question says the supervisor "personally oversaw all the repair work." So he has firsthand knowledge. But then, the defense is saying that the company keeps logs, which are in their possession. So the supervisor's testimony is about facts that the company records, but he's testifying from his own knowledge, not from the logs.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. The best evidence rule (FRE 1002) states that to prove the content of a writing, you need the original unless reasons are given why it's unavailable or an exception applies. But if the witness is testifying to facts they know personally, not based on the document, then the best evidence rule doesn't apply.

So in this case, the supervisor is testifying about what he saw and managed. So even if the company has logs, his testimony is based on his own knowledge, not on the logs. Therefore, the best evidence rule wouldn't bar his testimony.

Wait, but if the logs are the official records, and the supervisor is testifying about those specific details, perhaps he's relying on the logs. Or is he testifying from his memory? The question says he "sought to testify about the amount..., etc." It doesn't specify whether he's recalling from memory or referring to the logs. If he's testifying based on the logs, then the logs should be produced. But if he's using his own knowledge, then the best evidence rule doesn't apply.

Hmm, the question says the company "routinely recorded such factual information in their log books." So the information exists in the logs, but the supervisor is testifying about it. So maybe the defense is arguing that since the logs exist, the testimony is inadmissible under the best evidence rule.

But wait, the best evidence rule applies when the testimony is about the content of the document. So if the supervisor is testifying to the contents of the logs, then yes, the logs should be produced. But if he's testifying to facts he knows independently, then no.

So the key is whether the supervisor's testimony is based on the logs or his personal knowledge. The question doesn't explicitly say, but the supervisor personally oversaw the work, implying he knows these details firsthand.

If that's the case, then the best evidence rule doesn't apply because he's not testifying about the content of the logs but about what he observed. Therefore, his testimony is admissible.

Looking back at the options, option E says admissible because it's based on firsthand knowledge. Option C says admissible because it's relevant.

Wait, but the defense's objection is based on the best evidence rule. So if the testimony is based on personal knowledge, the best evidence rule doesn't apply, so the testimony is admissible despite the existence of the logs.

So the options:

Option E: admissible because firsthand knowledge. That would make sense. So the correct answer would be E.

Wait, but let me make sure. Another point: the best evidence rule applies only when the content of the writing is in question. If the witness isn't testifying about the writing's content but about the underlying facts, then the rule doesn't apply.

So in this case, the supervisor is testifying about the number of pipes used, hours, workers. If he knows these from being on-site, not from the logs, then his testimony is okay. The fact that the logs exist doesn't matter because his testimony isn't about the logs' content.

So the objection by the defense is incorrect. Therefore, the testimony should be admissible.

Looking at the options, option E is "admissible, because it is based on firsthand knowledge." That makes sense.

But wait, the initial objection was based on the best evidence rule, arguing that the logs should be used. So the question is whether the testimony is inadmissible because it's secondary evidence when the primary (logs) are available.

But if the supervisor's testimony is not about the logs but his own knowledge, then the best evidence rule doesn't apply. So the objection is without merit.

So among the options, the correct answer is E: admissible because based on firsthand knowledge.

Alternatively, if the testimony was about the content of the logs, then A would apply, but that's not the case here.

The question revolves around the admissibility of a construction supervisor's testimony regarding specific details of a construction project, despite the existence of log books that recorded the same information. The defense objected, citing the best evidence rule, which generally requires the original document to prove the content of a writing. However, the best evidence rule applies only when the content of the writing itself is at issue. If the witness is testifying based on their own firsthand knowledge rather than the content of the document, the rule does not apply.

In this case, the supervisor personally oversaw the repair work and sought to testify about the amount of sewer pipe used, the number of hours required, and the number of workers employed. The key distinction is whether the supervisor's testimony is based on personal knowledge or the log books. Since the supervisor's testimony is rooted in his direct involvement and observation of the work, it is not about the content of the log books but rather the facts as he personally knew them. Therefore, the best evidence rule does not bar his testimony, and the objection lacks merit.

Among the options provided, the correct answer is:

**E: admissible, because it is based on firsthand knowledge.**

This conclusion aligns with the principle that the best evidence rule does not apply when a witness testifies to facts within their personal knowledge, independent of any written records.

Answer: E
