Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this question about the percentage of survey respondents from India who reported paying a bribe in the last year to access public services, as of 2017. The options are A through J, with various percentages.

First, I remember that there's an organization called Transparency International that conducts surveys on corruption. They might have something called the Global Corruption Barometer, which I think measures public experiences with bribery. I believe they ask people in various countries whether they've paid a bribe in the past year.

I'm trying to recall specific data about India. I think India has had issues with corruption, so the percentage might be higher than some countries but not extremely high. Let me think about the numbers I've heard before. I remember hearing that in some countries, like in parts of Africa or Latin America, the percentages can be quite high, sometimes over 50% or even 70%. But India's situation might be different.

Wait, I think in the mid to late 2010s, around 2017, there was a push by the Indian government to reduce corruption, like with the demonetization move in 2016. But that might not have directly impacted bribery rates in public services right away.

From what I recall, around that time, India's bribery rate was somewhere in the 30s or maybe 40s percentage-wise. Let me think again. I remember a specific figure: I think it was around 39%. So about 39% of respondents in India admitted to paying a bribe in the last year.

Looking at the options, option G is 39%. That seems to fit. But wait, I should make sure I'm not mixing it up with another country. For example, I know that in some countries like South Africa, the rate was lower, maybe around 30%, but India's was higher.

Wait, another thought: I think the exact figure was 39% for India in the 2017 survey. So option G would be correct. Let me double-check my reasoning. The question is about 2017 data, and Transparency International's GCB would have covered that period. Their reports usually categorize countries, and India's percentage was in the range of about a third to a half of respondents.

Yes, I'm pretty confident that the correct answer is 39%, which is option G.
