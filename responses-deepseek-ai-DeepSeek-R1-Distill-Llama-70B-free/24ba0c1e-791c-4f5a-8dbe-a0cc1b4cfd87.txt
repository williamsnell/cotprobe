Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Bandura's behavior control systems from 1969. I'm a bit rusty on my psychology theories, but I'll try to think this through.

First, I remember that Bandura is known for social learning theory. He emphasized observation and imitation, right? His famous Bobo doll experiment comes to mind, where kids learned aggression by watching adults. But the question is about the three behavior control systems he proposed.

Wait, control systems. I think Bandura talked about different ways behavior is controlled. Let me recall. I think he proposed three main systems: one where behavior is controlled by external stimuli, like rewards or punishments. That's probably the first one.

Another system might be based on the consequences of behavior. So like, when a behavior leads to a positive outcome, it's reinforced, and negative outcomes discourage it. That sounds familiar too.

The third one, I'm a bit less sure about. I think it's something internal or symbolic. Maybe self-regulatory processes or cognitive factors. Oh right, Bandura talked about self-efficacy and how people's beliefs about their abilities influence their behavior. So maybe the third system is internal or symbolic processes.

Putting it all together, the three systems are probably external stimuli, consequences, and internal processes. Now, looking at the options:

Option D says: "Behavior is controlled by external stimuli, by their consequences or by internal (symbolic) processes." That matches what I was thinking.

Other options don't fit as well. Option A talks about instinctual drives and random events, which doesn't sound like Bandura. Option B mentions historical context and mood states, which might relate more to other theories. Option C is about perceptions and predictions, maybe more cognitive but not the three systems. Option E is about social factors but not the control systems. Option F includes subconscious desires and astrology, which don't seem right. G is about genetics and environment, which is more nature vs nurture. H includes spiritual beliefs, I includes beliefs and norms.

So I'm pretty confident the correct answer is D.

The question asks about Bandura's three behavior control systems from 1969. Bandura, known for his social learning theory, proposed that behavior is influenced by three key systems: external stimuli, consequences of behavior, and internal (symbolic) processes. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option D** correctly identifies these three systems: external stimuli, their consequences, and internal processes. This aligns with Bandura's theory, which emphasizes how behavior is shaped by external factors, the outcomes of actions, and internal cognitive processes like self-efficacy.

- Other options either mix unrelated concepts (e.g., instinctual drives, random events, spiritual beliefs) or focus on different aspects not directly tied to Bandura's control systems.

Thus, the correct answer is:

D: Behavior is controlled by external stimuli, by their consequences or by internal (symbolic) processes.

Answer: D
