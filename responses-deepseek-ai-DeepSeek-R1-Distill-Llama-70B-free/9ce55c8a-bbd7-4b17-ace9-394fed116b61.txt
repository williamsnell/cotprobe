Question:

From a behavioral perspective, phobic reactions to benign objects or events are acquired when those objects or events become associated with a stimulus that naturally produces a fear response. In other words, phobic reactions are due to:

Options:

A: stimulus generalization.
B: negative punishment.
C: classical conditioning.
D: negative reinforcement.
E: observational learning.
F: cognitive restructuring.
G: positive reinforcement.
H: operant conditioning.
I: positive punishment.
J: stimulus discrimination.

Okay, so I have this question about phobic reactions from a behavioral perspective. Hmm, I remember that phobias are irrational fears, but the question is about how they're acquired. Let me think.

The question says that phobic reactions happen when benign objects or events become linked to a stimulus that naturally causes fear. So, it's about association. Wait, classical conditioning is about associating stimuli. Like Pavlov's dogs, where a neutral stimulus becomes a conditioned one that elicits a response.

Stimulus generalization is when a response occurs to similar stimuli. Like if you're afraid of a specific dog, you might fear all dogs. But the question is about the initial acquisition, not generalization.

Operant conditioning is about reinforcement and punishment affecting behavior. So negative reinforcement would be removing an unpleasant stimulus to increase behavior, but that doesn't fit here.

Observational learning is learning by watching others, like Bandura's experiments. That could be a way, but the question seems to point more to classical conditioning because it's about associating stimuli.

So the correct answer is probably classical conditioning, option C.

The question asks about the acquisition of phobic reactions from a behavioral perspective. Phobic reactions are acquired when a neutral object or event becomes associated with a stimulus that naturally elicits fear. This process aligns with classical conditioning, where a neutral stimulus becomes a conditioned stimulus that triggers a fear response through association. Other options like stimulus generalization or operant conditioning do not directly explain the initial acquisition of phobic reactions.

Answer: C
