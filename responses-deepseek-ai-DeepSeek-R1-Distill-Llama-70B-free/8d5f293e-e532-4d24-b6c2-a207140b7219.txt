Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about vapor pressure and molecular weight. Hmm, I remember that when a solute is added to a solvent, the vapor pressure of the solvent decreases. That's called vapor pressure lowering. The formula for that is something like the change in vapor pressure is equal to the mole fraction of the solute times the vapor pressure of the pure solvent. Or wait, maybe it's the mole fraction of the solute. No, wait, I think the equation is P = X_solute * P_pure. Oh wait, no, I think it's the mole fraction of the solvent that is used in Raoult's Law. Because the vapor pressure is proportional to the mole fraction of the solvent.

Wait, Raoult's Law says that the partial vapor pressure of the solvent is equal to the mole fraction of the solvent multiplied by the pure solvent's vapor pressure. So P = X_solvent * P_pure.

So in this problem, the pure benzene has a vapor pressure of 640 torr at 75°C. The solution has a vapor pressure of 615 torr. So the decrease is 640 - 615 = 25 torr. But wait, the formula I think is P_solute = X_solute * P_pure? No, wait, no. Let me get this straight.

The solution's vapor pressure is lower than the pure solvent's because the solute particles are in the solution. So, the vapor pressure of the solution (P_solution) is equal to the mole fraction of the solvent (X_solvent) multiplied by the pure solvent's vapor pressure (P_pure). So P_solution = X_solvent * P_pure.

So, rearranging that, X_solvent = P_solution / P_pure. Then, the mole fraction of the solute would be 1 - X_solvent, because the mole fractions add up to 1.

Wait, no. Because the mole fraction of the solute plus the mole fraction of the solvent equals 1. So if X_solvent is the mole fraction, then X_solute = 1 - X_solvent.

Alternatively, the formula for vapor pressure lowering is ΔP = X_solute * P_pure. Because the vapor pressure of the solution is P_pure - ΔP. So the change in vapor pressure is equal to the mole fraction of the solute multiplied by the pure solvent's vapor pressure.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again. When a solute is added, the vapor pressure of the solvent decreases. So the solution's vapor pressure is lower than pure solvent. The formula is P_solution = X_solvent * P_pure. Or, since X_solute = (moles solute) / (moles solute + moles solvent), perhaps it's easier to think in terms of mole fractions.

But perhaps using the formula:

ΔP = (moles solute) / (moles solute + moles solvent) * P_pure.

Wait, no, that's the mole fraction of solute. Because moles solute divided by total moles.

So, the change in vapor pressure (ΔP) is equal to the mole fraction of the solute (X_solute) multiplied by P_pure.

Wait, let me get the correct formula. Raoult's Law is P = X_solvent * P_pure. So the vapor pressure of the solution is P = X_solvent * P_pure. So the change in P is P_pure - P_solution = P_pure (1 - X_solvent) = P_pure * X_solute.

So ΔP = X_solute * P_pure.

Yes, that's correct. So ΔP is 640 - 615 = 25 torr. So 25 = X_solute * 640. So X_solute = 25 / 640.

Let me calculate that. 25 divided by 640. 25/640 is 0.0390625.

So the mole fraction of the solute is about 0.0390625.

Now, the mole fraction X_solute is equal to (moles solute) / (moles solute + moles solvent). Because X_solute = n_solute / (n_solute + n_solvent).

Let me denote n_solute as the moles of solute, and n_solvent as the moles of benzene.

We need to find the molecular weight of the solute, so we'll need to find the moles of solute first.

The mass of the solute is 3.68 grams. Let's say the molecular weight is M. So moles solute = 3.68 / M.

The mass of the benzene is 53.0 grams. Its molecular weight is 78.0 g/mol. So moles benzene = 53.0 / 78.0 ≈ let me calculate that.

53 divided by 78. Let's see, 78 * 0.6 is 46.8. 78 * 0.68 is 53.04. Oh, wait, 78 * 0.68 is 78*(0.6 + 0.08) = 46.8 + 6.24= 53.04. So 53/78 is approximately 0.6795, roughly 0.6795 moles.

So n_solvent ≈ 0.6795 moles.

So the mole fraction X_solute is (n_solute) / (n_solute + n_solvent) = [ (3.68/M) ] / [ (3.68/M) + 0.6795 ].

But we already found that X_solute is 0.0390625.

So setting up the equation:

(3.68/M) / ( (3.68/M) + 0.6795 ) = 0.0390625.

Let me write that equation:

( (3.68/M) ) / ( (3.68/M) + 0.6795 ) ) = 0.0390625.

Let me denote (3.68/M) as n. So n / (n + 0.6795) ) = 0.0390625.

Solve for n.

Multiply both sides by (n + 0.6795):

n = 0.0390625 (n + 0.6795 )

Expand the right side:

n = 0.0390625 n + 0.0390625 * 0.6795.

Calculate 0.0390625 * 0.6795.

Let me compute that. 0.0390625 * 0.6795. Let's see:

0.0390625 is 25/640, but let's approximate.

0.0390625 * 0.6795 ≈ 0.03906 * 0.68.

0.03906 * 0.6 = 0.023436.

0.03906 * 0.08 = 0.0031248.

Adding them, 0.023436 + 0.0031248 ≈ 0.02656.

So approximately 0.02656.

So,

n = 0.0390625 n + 0.02656.

Subtract 0.0390625 n from both sides:

n - 0.0390625n = 0.02656.

n (1 - 0.0390625) = 0.02656.

1 - 0.0390625 is 0.9609375.

So,

n = 0.02656 / 0.9609375 ≈ let's calculate that.

0.02656 ÷ 0.9609375.

Let me compute that. Let me write it as 2656e-5 / 0.9609375.

Hmm, 2656e-5 is 0.02656.

Dividing 0.02656 by 0.9609375.

Let me compute 0.02656 / 0.9609375.

Well, 0.9609375 ≈ 0.9609.

So 0.02656 / 0.9609 ≈ approximately 0.02765.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately.

0.9609375 × 0.02765 ≈ 0.02656?

Let me compute 0.9609375 × 0.02765.

0.02765 * 1 = 0.02765.

But it's 0.9609375, so 0.02765 × 0.9609375 = let's compute:

0.02765 * 0.9609375 = ?

Well, 0.02765 * 0.9 = 0.024885.

0.02765 * 0.0609375 ≈ 0.02765 * 0.06 = 0.001659, and 0.02765 * 0.0009375 ≈ 0.0000259.

So adding 0.001659 + 0.0000259 ≈ 0.0016849.

Total approximation: 0.024885 + 0.0016849 ≈ 0.02657, which is close to our target of 0.02656. So 0.02765 is a good approximation.

So n ≈ 0.02765.

But n is (3.68 / M).

So,

3.68 / M = 0.02765.

Solve for M.

M = 3.68 / 0.02765.

Calculate that.

3.68 / 0.02765.

Let me compute it step by step.

Divide 3.68 by 0.02765.

Hmm, 0.02765 times 130 is 3.5895. Let's see:

0.02765 * 130 = ?

0.02765 * 100 = 2.765

0.02765 * 30 = 0.8295

Sum: 2.765 + 0.8295 = 3.5945.

But 3.68 is slightly higher than 3.5945.

The difference is 3.68 - 3.5945 = 0.0855.

How much more than 130 is needed?

Each additional unit adds 0.02765.

So 0.0855 / 0.02765 ≈ 3.09.

So total M ≈ 130 + 3.09 ≈ 133.09.

Wait, but wait. Let me check the exact calculation.

3.68 ÷ 0.02765.

Let me write it as 3680 ÷ 27.65.

Wait, 3680 divided by 27.65.

Calculate 27.65 × 133 = ?

27.65 × 130 = 27.65 *100=2765; 27.65 *30=828.5 → sum is 2765 +828.5= 3593.5.

27.65 ×3 = 82.95 → 3593.5 +82.95=3676.45.

So 27.65 ×133 ≈3676.45.

But 3680 is 3680-3676.45=3.55 higher.

So 133 + (3.55/27.65) → 3.55/27.65 ≈0.1283.

So 133.1283.

So approximately 133.13 g/mol.

Looking at the options, option J is 133.8, which is close. But wait, perhaps I made some approximation errors.

Let me redo the calculation more accurately.

n = (3.68 / M) = 0.02765 → M = 3.68 / 0.02765.

Let me compute 3.68 ÷ 0.02765.

Compute 3.68 ÷ 0.02765.

Alternatively, 3680 ÷ 27.65.

Let me compute 27.65 * 133 = 3676.45, as before.

3680-3676.45=3.55.

So 3.55 / 27.65 ≈0.1283.

So 133.1283.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier steps.

Wait, perhaps I should not have approximated the division earlier.

Alternatively, let's do it more accurately.

n = 0.02765.

n = 3.68 / M → M=3.68 / 0.02765.

Compute 3.68 ÷ 0.02765.

First, 0.02765 = 2.765e-2.

3.68 / 0.02765 = (3.68 / 2.765) ) * 100.

Because 0.02765 = 2.765 * 1e-2 → 1/0.02765 = (1/2.765) * 1e2.

So 3.68 / 2.765 = let's compute this.

2.765 × 1.33 → 2.765 *1=2.765, 2.765 *.33=0.91195 → sum 3.67695.

Which is just under 3.68.

So 2.765 ×1.33 = 3.67695.

3.68 -3.67695=0.00305.

So how much more? 0.00305 / 2.765 ≈ 0.001103.

So 1.33 + 0.001103 ≈1.3311.

So 3.68 / 2.765 ≈1.3311.

Multiply by 100 → 133.11.

So approximately 133.11 g/mol.

Looking at the options, option J is 133.8, which is close. But wait, perhaps the exact calculation gives a slightly different number. Let me check the earlier steps.

Wait, let me go back to the equation.

We had:

(3.68/M) / (3.68/M + 53/78) = 0.0390625.

Wait, perhaps I should compute n_solvent more accurately.

n_solvent =53.0 g /78.0 g/mol= 53/78.

Compute 53 ÷78.

78 × 0.679 = 78 *0.6=46.8; 78 *0.079=6.162 → sum 46.8 +6.162=52.962.

So 0.679 gives 52.962. 53-52.962=0.038.

So 0.679 + (0.038/78)=0.679 + 0.000487=0.679487.

So n_solvent=0.679487 moles.

So back to the equation:

n_solute / (n_solute + n_solvent)=0.0390625.

n_solute = (3.68)/M.

So,

(3.68/M) / ( (3.68/M) + 0.679487 ) = 0.0390625.

Let me let x = 3.68/M.

Then,

x/(x + 0.679487) =0.0390625.

Multiply both sides by (x + 0.679487):

x = 0.0390625 (x + 0.679487).

Expand right side:

x = 0.0390625 x + 0.0390625 *0.679487.

Compute 0.0390625 * 0.679487.

0.0390625 *0.6 =0.0234375.

0.0390625 *0.079487= approximately let's compute 0.0390625 *0.07=0.002734375; 0.0390625 *0.009487≈0.0003702.

So sum ≈0.002734375 +0.0003702=0.003104575.

So total 0.0234375 +0.003104575≈0.026542.

So,

x = 0.0390625 x + 0.026542.

Bring terms together:

x -0.0390625 x =0.026542.

0.9609375 x =0.026542.

x= 0.026542 /0.9609375.

Compute that.

0.026542 ÷0.9609375.

Let me write it as 26542e-6 / 960937.5e-6.

So 26542 /960937.5.

Wait, that's 26542 ÷ 960937.5.

Let me compute this division:

Approximately, 26542 ÷960938 ≈.

Well, 960938 ×0.0276= ?

960938 ×0.02=19218.76.

960938 ×0.007=6726.566.

Sum:19218.76 +6726.566=25945.326.

That's under 26542. The difference is 26542 -25945.326=596.674.

So 596.674 /960938≈0.0006208.

So total x≈0.0276 +0.0006208≈0.0282208.

Wait, no, that approach might not be correct. Alternatively, use calculator-like steps.

Compute 26542 ÷960938.

Approximately:

960938 ×0.0277=?

0.027 *960938= 25,945.326.

0.0007 *960938= 672.6566.

Sum:25945.326 +672.6566= 26,617.9826.

Which is close to 26,542.

Wait, 0.0277 ×960938=26,617.98.

We need 26,542, which is 75.98 less. So 0.0277 × ( 1 - (75.98/(960938 ×0.0277)) )= but perhaps another approach.

Let me compute 26542 /960938.

Compute 26542 ÷960938 ≈0.0276.

But perhaps I should use a better method.

Alternatively, 0.9609375 * x =0.026542 → x=0.026542 /0.9609375.

Let me compute it as 26542e-6 / 0.9609375.

Compute 26542 ÷ 96094 (approx, since 0.9609375 is 96094/100000).

Wait, perhaps I'll just compute 0.026542 ÷0.9609375.

0.026542 /0.9609375 = ?

Let me write this as 26542e-6 / 0.9609375.

But perhaps it's easier in decimal form.

0.026542 divided by 0.9609375.

Compute:

0.9609375 ×0.0277 → 0.9609375 ×0.02=0.01921875.

0.9609375 ×0.007= 0.0067265625.

Sum:0.01921875 +0.0067265625=0.0259453125.

That's less than 0.026542.

The difference is 0.026542 -0.0259453125=0.000
