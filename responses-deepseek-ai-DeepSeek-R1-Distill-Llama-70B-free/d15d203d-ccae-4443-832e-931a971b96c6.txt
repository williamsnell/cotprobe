Okay, so I've got this problem here about cooling a plate with air. Hmm, I remember from my heat transfer class that this has to do with convection and maybe some adiabatic wall temperatures. Let's see what the question is.

So the problem has two parts, (a) and (b). But looking at the options, it seems like each option gives both a temperature and a heat transfer rate, so I think each part of the question corresponds to one of those. Wait, but the way the question is phrased, part (a) is about finding the adiabatic wall temperature when the surface is at 95°F, and part (b) is about finding the heat transfer rate when the surface is 300°F. Hmm, but the options don't split them that way, each option gives a temp and a rate. So maybe each part has its own options, but the way the question is presented, perhaps we're to compute both and see which option matches.

Wait, the setup: The plate is cooled by air moving at 655 ft/s. The plate length is 1 inch, static temperature is 65°F. So for part (a), surface temp is 95°F, find the adiabatic wall temperature. For part (b), surface temp is 300°F, find the heat transfer rate.

I'm a bit rusty, but I remember that the adiabatic wall temperature is the temperature a surface would reach if there's no heat transfer (adiabatic), and it's related to the recovery temperature. Oh wait, the recovery temperature is the adiabatic wall temperature, right. The formula for the recovery temperature (Tr) depends on the flow regime, like whether it's laminar or turbulent.

Wait, the flow is over a plate, so it's probably a flat plate. The first thing I need to determine is the Reynolds number to know if it's laminar or turbulent. Because that affects the formula for the recovery temperature.

So, the plate length L is 1 inch, which is 1/12 of a foot, since 1 ft = 12 inches. Air speed u is 655 ft/s. Hmm, what's the kinematic viscosity of air? I remember that at around 60°F (which is close to 65°F given), the kinematic viscosity nu is about 1.6e-4 ft²/s. Wait, let me think. Or is it 1.6e-4? Or maybe 1.57e-4? I'm a bit unsure, but I'll go with 1.6e-4 for now.

Reynolds number Re = u * L / nu. Let me compute that. u is 655 ft/s, L is 1/12 ft. nu is 1.6e-4 ft²/s.

So Re = 655 * (1/12) / (1.6e-4) = ?

Let me compute numerator first: 655 * (1/12) = approx 655 /12 ≈ 54.5833 ft²/s.

Then divide by 1.6e-4: 54.5833 / 0.00016 = ?

Hmm, 54.5833 / 0.00016. Let me compute this step by step. 0.00016 is 1.6e-4, so 54.5833 / 1.6e-4 = 54.5833 / 0.00016.

Let me compute 54.5833 / 0.00016.

Well, 54.5833 divided by 0.0001 is 545,833.33. But since it's divided by 0.00016, which is 1.6 times larger, I divide 545,833 by 1.6.

545,833 / 1.6 ≈ 341,116. So Re ≈ 341,116.

Wait, but 1.6e-4 as nu. If I made a mistake in nu, that would change things. Let me check: at 65°F, which is about 18°C, the viscosity of air is around 1.8e-5 m²/s. Wait, converting that to ft²/s. 1 m² is approx 10.7639 ft², so 1.8e-5 m²/s *10.7639 = approx 1.937e-4 ft²/s. Oh wait, so perhaps I should have used 1.9e-4 instead of 1.6e-4.

Wait, let me get this right. Kinematic viscosity nu = viscosity mu / density rho. At 65°F, which is 18°C, mu for air is about 1.8e-5 kg/(m·s). Rho for air at 65°F and atmospheric pressure is roughly 1.2 kg/m³. So nu = mu/rho = (1.8e-5) / 1.2 = 1.5e-5 m²/s. Converting to ft²/s: 1 m² = 10.7639 ft², so 1.5e-5 *10.7639 ≈ 1.6145e-4 ft²/s. So approximately 1.615e-4 ft²/s.

So I think my initial nu was okay, about 1.6e-4.

So with that, Re is around 341,116. So that's well above the critical Re for laminar flow, which is around 500,000. Wait, no—wait, critical Re for a flat plate is about 500,000. So if Re is 3.4e5, that's below 5e5, so the flow is still laminar. Wait, no, wait: the critical Reynolds number for transition from laminar to turbulent is around 500,000, so if Re is 341,000, it's still laminar. Hmm, but wait, some sources say it's as low as 1e5 for transition. But in any case, for this problem, perhaps the flow is laminar.

Wait, but in the case of flow over a flat plate, if Re (based on length) is less than 500,000, flow is laminar; above that, turbulent. So here, 341k is less than 500k, so laminar.

Wait, but no, 341k is 341,000. Oh wait, 500,000 is 5e5, so 341k is 3.41e5, which is less than 5e5, so yes, laminar.

But wait, this is a bit confusing. Let me think again. The Reynolds number is Re = u * L / nu. So if L is 1 inch, which is 0.0833 ft, then yes, as I calculated before, Re is about 3.4e5, which is below 5e5, so flow is laminar.

Wait no, wait—wait, 655 ft/s is a really high speed! Because 655 ft/s is like 447 miles per hour. That's super fast, almost supersonic speed. So maybe I made a mistake in the units somewhere. Oh wait, in the problem statement, the plate is cooled by a stream of air moving at 655 ft/sec. Wait, 655 ft/s is about 447 mph, which is extremely high for typical airflow. Maybe the intended units are ft/min? Because 655 ft/s is way too high. Wait, but the problem says ft/sec, so I guess I have to go with that.

So, regardless, the Re is 3.4e5, which is in the laminar to maybe lower end of turbulent. But given that 5e5 is the critical, perhaps we're in laminar flow. So for laminar flow, the recovery factor is different than for turbulent.

The recovery temperature, Tr, is given by Tr = Tw - T_static, where Tw is the adiabatic wall temperature. Wait, no, Tr is the recovery temperature, which is the temperature rise due to viscous dissipation. The formula for the recovery temperature depends on whether the flow is laminar or turbulent.

For laminar flow over a flat plate, the recovery factor is Tr = T_static + (Taw - T_static) * Pr^(1/2) * (gamma/(gamma+1))^0.5, but wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, for laminar flow, the recovery factor is given by Tr = T_static + (Taw - T_static) * sqrt(Pr), but I'm a bit confused. Wait, no, the recovery temperature is defined as Tr = Taw = T_static + r*(T0 - T_static), where r is the recovery factor.

Wait, perhaps I should recall the exact formula. The recovery temperature (Tr) is given by:

Tr = T_static + ( ( ( ( (1 + ( (gamma-1)/2 ) * Ma^2 ) ) * (T0 - T_static) ) ) )

Wait, no, maybe that's for stagnation temperature. Alternatively, for a flat plate, the recovery temperature is given by:

Tr = T_static + (Taw - T_static) * (Pr)^(1/3) * ( (gamma) / (gamma + 1) )^(1/2) )? Hmm, not sure. Let me think again.

Wait, I think for laminar flow, the recovery factor is given by Tr = Taw = T_static + (T0 - T_static) * sqrt(Pr), where Pr is the Prandtl number. And for turbulent flow, it's Pr^(1/3). But I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think.

Wait, no. The recovery factor 'r' is defined as (Tw - T_static)/(T0 - T_static), where T0 is the stagnation temperature. But wait, in this case, perhaps we're dealing with the adiabatic wall temperature, which could be the same as the recovery temperature. Hmm.

Alternatively, the adiabatic wall temperature (Tw) can be calculated using the relation:

Tw = T_static + r*(T0 - T_static)

But if the flow is incompressible and the plate is at a different temperature, perhaps we can model it differently. Alternatively, for high-speed flows, the adiabatic wall temperature accounts for the recovery of kinetic energy. But perhaps for the purposes of this problem, we can assume that the air is incompressible, so the stagnation temperature is not involved.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Since the problem is about a plate being cooled by air moving at high speed, and we're to find the adiabatic wall temperature when the surface is at 95°F, and the static temperature is 65°F.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to calculate the heat transfer coefficient first, then use that to find the adiabatic temperature. But wait, the adiabatic condition is when the heat flux is zero, so the conduction heat transfer is zero. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, the adiabatic wall temperature is the temperature the wall would have if there's no heat transfer, so it's a function of the flow conditions and the surrounding temperature.

Wait, I think the formula for the adiabatic wall temperature (Tw) is given by:

Tw = T_inf + (T_w, recovery - T_inf) * ( (q'' ) / (h) ) ?

No, perhaps that's not it. Alternatively, the adiabatic wall temperature is found when the heat flux is zero, so from the convection equation:

q'' = h (Tw - Ts)

But if q'' is zero (adiabatic), then Tw = Ts. But that can't be right because Ts is the static temperature of the fluid.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Oh wait, no, the adiabatic wall temperature is the temperature the wall would be if it were insulated such that there's no heat transfer. So it's not the same as the static temperature. Hmm. Maybe I should consider the energy balance including the friction.

Wait, the adiabatic wall temperature occurs when the heat transfer is zero, so the wall's temperature adjusts to balance the convective heat transfer. Alternatively, perhaps the adiabatic temperature is the temperature that would be measured on the wall under adiabatic conditions, which includes the effects of viscous heating.

Wait, perhaps the formula is:

Tw = T_inf + ( (eta)*(Ts0 - T_inf) )

Where eta is the recovery factor and Ts0 is the stagnation temperature. But I'm getting stuck here. Alternatively, perhaps I should refer to the Eckert formula or something related.

Alternatively, considering that the flow is over a flat plate, and that the recovery temperature is given by:

Tr = T_static + r*(T0 - T_static)

Where T0 is the stagnation temperature, and r is the recovery factor. Now, for laminar flow, r is sqrt(Pr), and for turbulent flow, it's Pr^(1/3).

But wait, in this case, the static temperature is given as 65°F, and the plate's surface is at 95°F. But for part (a), we're to find the adiabatic wall temperature when the surface is at 95°F, but that seems a bit confusing. Maybe I'm getting the terms wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the adiabatic wall temperature, which is different from the surface temperature. Because in part (a), the surface is at 95°F, but the adiabatic wall temperature is a theoretical value when there's no heat transfer. So perhaps the given surface temperature isn't directly used in part (a), except that I'm supposed to find the adiabatic temperature when the surface is at 95°F. Hmm, that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about part (a): given the surface temperature is 95°F, what is the adiabatic wall temperature? Or is the adiabatic temperature a property that doesn't depend on the surface temperature? Hmm, maybe I'm confused about the terms.

Wait, perhaps the adiabatic wall temperature is the temperature that the wall would reach if it were perfectly insulated, meaning that it's in equilibrium with the surrounding flow. So it's a function of the flow's stagnation temperature and the recovery factor. So perhaps the surface temperature given in the problem (95°F or 300°F) is not directly needed for part (a), which asks for the adiabatic temperature, but perhaps for part (b) when calculating heat transfer rate.

Wait, that makes more sense. So for part (a), the surface temperature (95°F) is perhaps a red herring, or maybe it's used in the calculation. Alternatively, perhaps part (a) is about finding the adiabatic temperature, which is a property of the flow, irrespective of the surface temperature. So, let's proceed.

So, to calculate the adiabatic wall temperature (Tr), I need the recovery factor, which depends on whether the flow is laminar or turbulent.

Earlier, we calculated Re as 3.4e5, which is below 5e5, so flow is laminar. Therefore, the recovery factor r is sqrt(Pr). The Prandtl number for air is about 0.7. So r = sqrt(0.7) ≈ 0.8367.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact Pr value. At higher temperatures, Pr might be around 0.7, yeah.

Now, the stagnation temperature T0 is given by T0 = T_static + (V^2)/(2 * c_p), where V is the flow speed, and c_p is the specific heat at constant pressure.

But wait, this is only valid for subsonic flows where the effect is not too significant. However, the speed is 655 ft/s, which is very high, about Mach 0.95 (since the speed of sound in air at 65°F is around 678 ft/s). So Mach number Ma is 655/678 ≈ 0.966, so it's transonic. But perhaps for the purposes of this problem, we can use the incompressible form, or perhaps neglect the stagnation temperature effect.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the stagnation temperature is not needed, and that the adiabatic wall temperature is simply the recovery temperature given by Tr = T_static + r*(T0 - T_static). But without knowing T0, perhaps we need to calculate it.

Wait, the stagnation temperature T0 is related to the static temperature T by:

T0 = T + V²/(2 * c_p)

So, we need to compute that. Let's compute V²/(2 c_p).

First, V = 655 ft/s.

V^2 = (655)^2 = 429,025 ft²/s².

c_p for air is approximately 0.24 Btu/lbm-°F. Wait, but in SI units, it's about 1005 J/kg·K, but in imperial units, 0.24 Btu/lbm°F.

So, V²/(2 c_p) = 429025 / (2 * 0.24) = 429025 / 0.48 ≈ 894,479.17 °F.

Wait, that can't be right. Because adding that to the static temp of 65°F would give T0 as 894,500°F, which is obviously impossible because that's way beyond any real scenario. So perhaps this approach isn't correct. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to be solved using an incompressible flow approach, neglecting the stagnation temperature effect. So, perhaps the adiabatic wall temperature is just the static temperature plus some recovery based on Prandtl number.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is Tr = T_inf + r (T_w - T_inf), but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should think about the heat transfer equation. The heat flux q'' is given by:

q'' = h (Tw - Ts)

Where h is the convection heat transfer coefficient, Tw is the wall temperature, and Ts is the fluid temperature (static temperature, 65°F in this case).

But when the wall is adiabatic, q'' = 0, which would imply Tw = Ts. But that can't be correct because that would mean no temperature difference, which doesn't account for the recovery effect. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Alternatively, perhaps the adiabatic wall temperature is the temperature the wall would reach when there's no heat transfer to or from the fluid, which would involve the recovery of the kinetic energy. But I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps the problem is intended to use the formula:

Tw = T_inf + (T_s - T_inf) * (1 + sqrt(Pr)) 

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, I remember that the adiabatic wall temperature is given by:

Tw = T_inf + r (T_w - T_inf)

But I'm not confident. Wait, perhaps I should refer to the Sieder-Tate equation for convection, but that's more for pipes.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using the formula for the recovery temperature, which is:

Tr = T
