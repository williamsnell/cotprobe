Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about therapy clients from Asian and Asian-American backgrounds compared to Anglo clients. Hmm, I remember that cultural differences play a big role in how people approach mental health and therapy. Let me think about what I've learned before.

The question is asking what experts frequently point out about Asian and Asian-American clients. The options are A through H. I need to figure out which one is correct.

I recall that in many Asian cultures, mental health issues are often not discussed openly. There's a stigma attached, so people might not express emotional problems directly. Instead, they might present physical symptoms. Oh right, somatic symptoms! Because talking about emotions can be taboo, so they might say they have headaches or stomachaches instead of saying they're feeling anxious or depressed. So that might point towards option F, which says they express emotional problems as somatic symptoms.

Wait, let me go through the options again. Option C says they express problems as verbal symptoms, which I think is the opposite. Anglo clients might be more likely to talk about their feelings verbally. So F makes more sense.

What about the other options? Option A says they prefer a less directive approach. I'm not sure. I think some cultures might prefer a more directive therapist because of the hierarchical nature. Or maybe they expect the therapist to be more expert and tell them what to do. But I'm not certain about that.

Option B says they're grounded more in the here-and-now. I think some therapies focus on the present, like CBT. But I'm not sure if that's specific to Asian clients. Option E is the opposite, so maybe not.

Options D and H talk about goal-setting being immediate or delayed. I'm not sure about that. Maybe some cultures prefer immediate goals, but I don't remember specifics.

Option G says they prefer group therapy. I think in many Asian cultures, there's a preference for individual therapy because group settings might make them feel uncomfortable, especially with the stigma around mental health. Or maybe the opposite? I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

So focusing back on F: expressing emotional problems as somatic symptoms. That rings a bell. I think that's a common finding in cross-cultural psychology. So I'm leaning towards F being the correct answer.

In comparing Asian and Asian-American therapy clients to Anglo clients, experts often note cultural differences in how emotional distress is expressed. Asian and Asian-American clients may be less likely to openly discuss emotional issues due to stigma and cultural norms. Instead, they often present their emotional problems as physical or somatic symptoms, such as headaches or stomachaches. This aligns with option F, which states that they are likely to express emotional problems as somatic symptoms. Other options, such as preferring group therapy or specific goal-setting approaches, are less supported by common cultural observations.

Answer: F
