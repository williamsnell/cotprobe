Okay, so I have this question about which hormone is responsible for metamorphosis in amphibians. Hmm, I remember learning about amphibian development in biology class. Let me think.

Metamorphosis is that big change that happens, like when a tadpole turns into a frog. I think it's a thyroid hormone involved. Oh right, thyroxine! Because without it, the tadpoles don't develop properly. I remember something about goiters in frogs if they don't have enough iodine, which is needed for thyroxine production.

Wait, but I should double-check the options. The options are A through J. Let's see:

A: Growth hormone. I thought that's more about growth in general, like in humans for height.

B: Estrogen. That's a sex hormone, involved in female characteristics.

C: Thyroxine. Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

D: Insulin. Regulates blood sugar, not related to metamorphosis.

E: Prolactin. I'm not too sure, but I think it's involved in lactation or something else, not frogs.

F: Testosterone. Male sex hormone, so probably not the main one here.

G: Cortisol. Stress hormone, not directly about development.

H: Adrenaline. Fight or flight, not metamorphosis.

I: Melatonin. Related to sleep and pineal gland, I think.

J: Progesterone. Another sex hormone, for pregnancy maybe.

So the answer should be C: thyroxine.

The hormone responsible for metamorphosis in amphibians is thyroxine, which is crucial for the developmental changes from tadpole to frog. 

Answer: C
