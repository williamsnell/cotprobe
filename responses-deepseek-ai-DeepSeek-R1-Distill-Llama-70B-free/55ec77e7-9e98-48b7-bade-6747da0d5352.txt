Question:

Find the ∆H°, heat of reaction, for the hydrolysis of urea to CO_2 and NH_3. Although the reaction does not pro-ceed at a detectable rate in the absence of the enzyme, urease, ∆H may still be computed from the following thermodynamic data: Component ∆H°_f (Kcal/mole Urea (aq) - 76.30 CO_2 (aq) - 98.69 H_2O (l) - 68.32 NH_3 (aq) - 19.32 The hydrolysis reaction is H_2O (l) + H_2N - CO - NH_2 \rightarrow CO_2(aq) + 2NH_3 (aq) (urea)

Options:

A: -2.71 Kcal/mole
B: 7.29 Kcal/mole
C: 5.29 Kcal/mole

E: 10.29 Kcal/mole
F: 3.29 Kcal/mole
G: 6.29 Kcal/mole
H: 9.29 Kcal/mole

Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here about the hydrolysis of urea. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question is asking for the ΔH° (enthalpy change) of the reaction. They provided the standard heats of formation (ΔH°_f) for each component involved. The reaction given is the hydrolysis of urea into carbon dioxide and ammonia. But wait, the reaction equation they wrote is a bit confusing. Oh wait, let me look again.

The reaction is: H2O(l) + H2N-CO-NH2 → CO2(aq) + 2NH3(aq). Oh right, that's the hydrolysis of urea. Urea is H2NCONH2, so when it reacts with water, it breaks down into CO2 and two NH3 molecules.

Now, to find ΔH° for the reaction, I remember that we use Hess's Law. That's the one where you calculate the heat of reaction by taking the sum of the heats of formation of the products minus the sum of the reactants, each multiplied by their stoichiometric coefficients.

So the formula is ΔH°_rxn = Σ ΔH°f(products) - Σ ΔH°f(reactants).

Let me list out the ΔH°f values given:

Urea (aq): -76.30 Kcal/mol
CO2 (aq): -98.69 Kcal/mol
H2O (l): -68.32 Kcal/mol
NH3 (aq): -19.32 Kcal/mol

Wait, the reactants are H2O and urea. The products are CO2 and 2 NH3. So I'll need to plug those into the formula.

Breaking it down:

Reactants:
- Urea: 1 mole, so ΔH°f = -76.30
- H2O: 1 mole, ΔH°f = -68.32
So total for reactants: (-76.30) + (-68.32) = let me calculate that. 76.30 +68.32 is 144.62, so with negatives it's -144.62 Kcal.

Products:
- CO2: 1 mole, ΔH°f = -98.69
- NH3: 2 moles, so 2 * (-19.32) = -38.64
Total for products: (-98.69) + (-38.64) = 98.69 +38.64 is 137.33, so -137.33 Kcal.

Now applying the formula: ΔH°_rxn = (products) - (reactants) = (-137.33) - (-144.62) = 

Wait, wait. Let me be careful with the signs. So products sum is -137.33, reactants sum is -144.62.

So ΔH° = (-137.33) - (-144.62) = (-137.33) + 144.62 = 7.29 Kcal/mol?

Wait, that would make the ΔH° positive, meaning the reaction is endothermic. But wait, urea hydrolysis... I thought it's usually exothermic, but maybe I'm mixing things up. Or perhaps the data here leads to a positive value.

Looking at the options, option B is 7.29 Kcal/mol. That's one of the choices. So that would be the answer.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations.

Reactants: (urea) is -76.30, H2O is -68.32. So total is -76.30 -68.32 = -144.62.

Products: CO2 is -98.69, and 2 NH3 is 2*(-19.32) = -38.64. So total is -98.69 -38.64 = -137.33.

Then the formula: products minus reactants → (-137.33) - (-144.62) = 7.29 Kcal/mol.

Yes, that's correct. So the ΔH° is positive 7.29 Kcal/mol, which is option B.

To calculate the standard enthalpy change (ΔH°) for the hydrolysis of urea, we use Hess's Law:

\[
\Delta H^\circ_{\text{rxn}} = \Sigma \Delta H^\circ_f(\text{products}) - \Sigma \Delta H^\circ_f(\text{reactants})
\]

The reaction is:

\[
\text{H}_2\text{O (l)} + \text{H}_2\text{N-CO-NH}_2 \rightarrow \text{CO}_2(\text{aq}) + 2\text{NH}_3(\text{aq})
\]

### Step 1: Identify the thermodynamic data
- **Reactants**:
  - Urea (aq): \(\Delta H^\circ_f = -76.30 \, \text{Kcal/mol}\)
  - H\(_2\)O (l): \(\Delta H^\circ_f = -68.32 \, \text{Kcal/mol}\)
  - Total for reactants: \(-76.30 + (-68.32) = -144.62 \, \text{Kcal}\)

- **Products**:
  - CO\(_2\) (aq): \(\Delta H^\circ_f = -98.69 \, \text{Kcal/mol}\)
  - NH\(_3\) (aq): \(2 \times -19.32 = -38.64 \, \text{Kcal}\)
  - Total for products: \(-98.69 + (-38.64) = -137.33 \, \text{Kcal}\)

### Step 2: Apply the formula
\[
\Delta H^\circ_{\text{rxn}} = (-137.33) - (-144.62) = -137.33 + 144.62 = 7.29 \, \text{Kcal/mol}
\]

### Conclusion
The calculated ΔH° for the reaction is \(+7.29 \, \text{Kcal/mol}\), which corresponds to **option B**.
