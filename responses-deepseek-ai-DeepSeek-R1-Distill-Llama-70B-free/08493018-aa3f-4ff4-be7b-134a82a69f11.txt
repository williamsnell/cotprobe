Okay, so I've got this question about a step-up chopper, also known as a DC-DC converter. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. 

The question says the input voltage is 110 V, and the output voltage is 150 V. I need to find the duty cycle. Wait, what's the formula again? Oh right, for a step-up chopper, the output voltage depends on the duty cycle. 

I remember that in a step-up converter (which is a boost converter), the formula relates the input voltage (Vin), output voltage (Vout), and the duty cycle (D). I think the formula is Vout = Vin * (1/(1-D)). Or wait, maybe it's Vout = Vin * (1-D), no, that can't be right because if D is 0, Vout would be Vin, which doesn't make sense for a boost converter. Oh wait, no, the correct formula for boost converter is Vout = Vin / (1 - D). Yeah, that makes sense because as the duty cycle increases, the output voltage increases, which aligns with how boost converters work.

So the formula is Vout = Vin / (1 - D). I need to solve for D. Let's plug in the numbers. Vin is 110V, Vout is 150V. 

So 150 = 110 / (1 - D). Let's rearrange this. Multiply both sides by (1 - D) to get 150*(1 - D) = 110. Expanding that gives 150 - 150D = 110. 

Subtract 110 from both sides: 40 = 150D. Wait no, 150 - 110 is 40, so 40 = 150D? Wait, wait, let me check my math. 150*(1-D) equals 110. So 150 minus 150D equals 110. Subtract 110 from both sides: 40 = 150D. No, wait, 150*(1-D) = 110 → 1 - D = 110 / 150. Oh wait, I think I made a mistake in the rearrangement.

Let me do that again. Starting from 150 = 110 / (1 - D). Multiply both sides by (1 - D): 150*(1 - D) = 110. Then divide both sides by 150: 1 - D = 110 / 150. So 110 divided by 150 is equal to 11/15, which is approximately 0.7333. So 1 - D = 0.7333. Therefore, D = 1 - 0.7333 = 0.2667, which is approximately 0.2667. 

Looking at the options, D is 0.27, which is option D. So the duty cycle is around 0.27. 

Wait, but let me double-check my formula. I think boost converters have output voltage higher than input, which matches this scenario. So the formula should be correct. Alternatively, sometimes the formula is written as Vout/Vin = 1/(1-D). So 150/110 equals 1/(1-D). 150/110 is approximately 1.3636. So 1.3636 = 1/(1-D). Take reciprocal: (1-D) = 1/1.3636 ≈ 0.7333. So D ≈ 0.2667, same as before. Yep, that's correct. So the answer should be D: 0.27.

To determine the duty cycle of a step-up chopper (boost converter) with an input voltage \( V_{\text{in}} = 110 \, \text{V} \) and an output voltage \( V_{\text{out}} = 150 \, \text{V} \), we use the formula for a boost converter:

\[
V_{\text{out}} = \frac{V_{\text{in}}}{1 - D},
\]

where \( D \) is the duty cycle. Rearranging the formula to solve for \( D \):

\[
1 - D = \frac{V_{\text{in}}}{V_{\text{out}}}.
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
1 - D = \frac{110}{150} = \frac{11}{15} \approx 0.7333.
\]

Thus:

\[
D = 1 - 0.7333 = 0.2667 \, \text{or approximately} \, 0.27.
\]

From the options provided, the closest value to \( D = 0.27 \) is **D: 0.27**.
