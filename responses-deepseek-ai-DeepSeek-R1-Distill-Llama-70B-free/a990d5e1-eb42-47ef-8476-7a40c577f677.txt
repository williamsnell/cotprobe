Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an electric motor lifting a mass. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the motor's label says Input: 120V AC, 1.0 Amps, 60 Hz. Efficiency is 75%. They want to know at what constant speed the motor can lift a 6 kg mass. The options are from A to J, with various m/s values.

First, I remember that efficiency relates input power to output power. Efficiency (η) is output power divided by input power, right? So η = P_out / P_in. Given that the efficiency is 75%, that means the output power is 75% of the input power.

So, I should probably calculate the input power first. Input power for an electric motor is voltage multiplied by current. Oh wait, but wait—AC motors have a power factor too, but the problem doesn't mention that. Hmm. Oh wait, the problem probably assumes that the voltage and current are the true RMS values, so maybe I can just multiply V and I directly to get input power. Yeah, I think that's the case here.

So input power P_in = V * I = 120 V * 1.0 A = 120 Watts. Got that.

Efficiency is 75%, so 0.75. So output power P_out = η * P_in = 0.75 * 120 W = 90 Watts. Right, so the motor can deliver 90 Watts of mechanical power.

Now, the output power is used to lift the mass. Power is work done over time, and in this case, the work is lifting the mass against gravity. The power needed to lift the mass at a constant speed would be equal to the weight of the mass (mg) multiplied by the velocity (v). Because power P = force * velocity, and force here is mg.

So, setting the output power equal to mgh/t, but since it's at constant speed, the power is mgv. So P_out = m * g * v.

We have m = 6 kg, g is 9.8 m/s². So rearranging for v: v = P_out / (m * g).

Plugging in the numbers: P_out is 90 W, m is 6 kg, g is 9.8.

So v = 90 / (6 * 9.8). Let me calculate that.

6 * 9.8 is 58.8. So 90 divided by 58.8. Let me compute that: 90 / 58.8 ≈ 1.53 m/s. Wait, wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait, 58.8 times 1.5 is 88.2. Oh wait, 58.8 * 1.53 is roughly 90. So yeah, around 1.53 m/s.

Looking at the options, option B is 1.5 m/s, which is very close. So I think the answer is B.

Wait a second, but let me double-check my steps. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Input power P_in = V * I = 120 * 1 = 120 W. Efficiency 75%, so P_out = 0.75 * 120 = 90 W. That's right.

Power needed to lift mass: P = m * g * v. So v = P/(m g). Plugging in 90/(6*9.8) = 90/(58.8) ≈ 1.53 m/s. So 1.5 m/s is option B. That looks correct.

But wait, the problem says 'at what constant speed can the motor lift up a 6 kg mass.' So I think that's correct. So the answer should be B.
</think>

To determine the constant speed at which the motor can lift a 6 kg mass, we start by calculating the input and output power of the motor. The input power is given by:

\[
P_{\text{in}} = V \cdot I = 120 \, \text{V} \cdot 1.0 \, \text{A} = 120 \, \text{W}.
\]

The efficiency of the motor is 75%, so the output power is:

\[
P_{\text{out}} = \eta \cdot P_{\text{in}} = 0.75 \cdot 120 \, \text{W} = 90 \, \text{W}.
\]

The output power is used to lift the mass against gravity. The power required to lift the mass at a constant speed is given by:

\[
P_{\text{out}} = m \cdot g \cdot v,
\]

where \( m = 6 \, \text{kg} \), \( g = 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 \), and \( v \) is the speed. Rearranging for \( v \):

\[
v = \frac{P_{\text{out}}}{m \cdot g}.
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
v = \frac{90}{6 \cdot 9.8} = \frac{90}{58.8} \approx 1.53 \, \text{m/s}.
\]

The closest option to this value is \( 1.5 \, \text{m/s} \), which corresponds to option B.
