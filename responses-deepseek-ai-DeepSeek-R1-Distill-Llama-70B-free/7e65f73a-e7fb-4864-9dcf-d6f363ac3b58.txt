Okay, so I've got this problem about a rectangle where the length is twice its width, and the diagonal is 5 times the square root of 5. I need to find the area of the rectangle. Hmm, let's see. 

Alright, first, I should probably visualize the rectangle. So, a rectangle has length and width, and the diagonal connects two opposite corners. I remember from the Pythagorean theorem that in a rectangle, the diagonal forms a right triangle with the length and width. So, the diagonal squared equals the length squared plus the width squared. 

The problem says the length is twice the width. Let me assign variables to make this easier. Let's say the width is 'w' and the length is '2w' because it's twice as long. 

So, the diagonal is given as 5√5. Plugging into the Pythagorean theorem: (diagonal)^2 = (length)^2 + (width)^2. That becomes (5√5)^2 = (2w)^2 + w^2. 

Wait, let me compute each part. 5 squared is 25, and (√5)^2 is 5, so 25*5 is 125. So the left side is 125. 

On the right side, (2w)^2 is 4w², and w² is just w². Adding those together gives 4w² + w² = 5w². 

So now the equation is 125 = 5w². To solve for w², I divide both sides by 5. That gives w² = 25. Taking the square root of both sides, w = 5. Because width can't be negative, so we take the positive root. 

Now, the width is 5 and the length is twice that, so length is 10. The area of the rectangle is length multiplied by width, so 5 * 10 equals 50. 

Wait, but let me check the options. Option F is 50, which matches my calculation. But wait, did I miss anything here? Let me go through again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Alternative approach: Maybe I should write down each step again. 

Given:
length (l) = 2 * width (w)
diagonal (d) = 5√5

From Pythagoras: l² + w² = d².
Substitute l with 2w: (2w)² + w² = (5√5)²
4w² + w² = 25*5 → 5w² = 125 → w²=25 → w=5.

Then, l = 2*5 =10. Area is 5*10=50. So yes, that seems correct.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option F is 50, which is what I got. So the answer should be F. 

I don't see any errors in my reasoning here. So I'm pretty confident the answer is 50.

To solve the problem, we start by noting that the length of the rectangle is twice its width. Let the width be \( w \), so the length is \( 2w \). The diagonal of the rectangle is given as \( 5\sqrt{5} \). Using the Pythagorean theorem:

\[
\text{diagonal}^2 = \text{length}^2 + \text{width}^2
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
(5\sqrt{5})^2 = (2w)^2 + w^2
\]

Simplify each term:

\[
125 = 4w^2 + w^2
\]

\[
125 = 5w^2
\]

Solving for \( w^2 \):

\[
w^2 = \frac{125}{5} = 25
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
w = 5
\]

The width is \( 5 \), and the length is \( 2w = 10 \). The area of the rectangle is:

\[
\text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 10 \times 5 = 50
\]

Thus, the area of the rectangle is \( 50 \), which corresponds to option F.

Answer: F
