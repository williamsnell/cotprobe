Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about instrumental responses and punishment. Hmm, I remember from my psychology classes that instrumental conditioning, also known as operant conditioning, deals with how behaviors are modified by their consequences. So, the question is about what happens when a moderately strong instrumental response is subjected to moderate punishment.

Let me think. Instrumental responses are actions that lead to specific outcomes. When a behavior is followed by a punishment, which is an unpleasant stimulus, it usually decreases the likelihood of that behavior happening again. So punishment is a way to suppress behavior.

The question is about the effect of moderate punishment on a response of moderate strength. So, if the punishment is moderate, it's not extremely harsh. The response itself isn't the weakest or the strongest, just moderate.

Wait, I remember that when a behavior is punished, it can lead to temporary suppression. Like, if a child touches a hot stove and gets burned, they might stop touching it for a while. But does the suppression last? Or does it just suppress the behavior temporarily?

I think that with punishment, especially if it's not too severe, the behavior might be temporarily suppressed but could return over time. Because sometimes, the individual might forget the punishment or find the reward worth the risk again.

Looking at the options:

A: be temporarily suppressed but strengthen over time. That doesn't sound right because if punishment is effective, the behavior should decrease, not strengthen. Unless the punishment stops, maybe the behavior comes back.

Wait, no, another angle. Punishment can suppress the behavior, but if the punishment isn't consistent, the behavior might start happening again. But the question says it's subjected to moderate punishment. I'm not sure if the punishment is continuous or a single instance.

Alternatively, if the response is of moderate strength, moderate punishment might make it decrease but not eliminate it. So maybe the response is suppressed but not eliminated.

Option G says "be suppressed." That could be a possibility. But is it temporary or more permanent?

Another thought: the question says "when subjected to moderate punishment." So the punishment is applied, and the response is moderate. So the behavior should decrease. But when the punishment stops, the behavior might return, which would make it a temporary suppression.

Wait, the options don't mention anything about stopping punishment. The question is about the immediate effect when punishment is applied.

So, when you apply punishment, the behavior's frequency decreases. So the response is suppressed.

So the correct answer would be G: be suppressed.

Wait, but let me look again at the options. Option A is about being temporarily suppressed but strengthen over time. That would imply that after some time, the response becomes stronger. But that doesn't make sense in the context of ongoing punishment.

Wait, no. If the punishment is applied each time the response occurs, then the suppression would continue. But if the punishment is only applied once or intermittently, the suppression might be temporary, and the response could return.

Wait, the question says "subjected to moderate punishment." It doesn't specify whether it's continuous or a single instance. So assuming that the punishment is being applied as a consequence each time the response occurs, the suppression would be more than temporary.

Alternatively, I think in operant conditioning, punishment leads to a decrease in the behavior's frequency. So the response would be suppressed. So the answer would be G.

Wait, but another option is B: be eliminated. That would be if the punishment was so severe that the behavior stops entirely. But since the punishment is moderate and the response is moderate, it's more likely to be suppressed but not eliminated.

So I think the correct answer is G: be suppressed.

Wait, but another thought: the question says "subjected to moderate punishment." So the punishment is ongoing? Or is it a single instance? If it's a single instance, the suppression might be temporary. But if it's ongoing, the suppression would be more lasting.

The question isn't clear on that, but generally in these questions, they refer to the effect of punishment being applied, leading to suppression. So I think G is the answer.

When considering the effect of moderate punishment on an instrumental response of moderate strength, it is important to understand the principles of operant conditioning. Punishment, as an unpleasant stimulus following a behavior, typically decreases the frequency of that behavior. However, the severity of the punishment and the strength of the response play a role in determining the outcome.

In this case, the punishment is moderate, and the response is also of moderate strength. Moderate punishment is unlikely to eliminate the behavior entirely but will suppress it. The suppression is expected to be more than temporary, as the punishment is assumed to be applied consistently as a consequence of the response. While temporary suppression might occur if the punishment were intermittent or ceased, the question implies ongoing punishment, leading to a sustained decrease in the response.

Given the options, the most accurate answer is that the response will be suppressed.

Answer: G
