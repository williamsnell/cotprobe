Okay, so I have this problem here where George is taking out a loan, and I need to figure out how much interest he'll pay. Let me see the details again. The loan is for 6 months, the amount is $300, and the interest rate is 8%. Hmm, I think I remember that interest calculations can vary based on whether it's simple or compound interest. But since this is a short-term loan, I'm guessing it's simple interest.

Alright, simple interest formula is I = P * r * t, right? Where I is the interest, P is the principal amount, r is the rate, and t is the time in years. Wait, the time here is 6 months. Oh, right, I need to convert that into years. So 6 months is half a year, so t would be 0.5 years.

Let me plug in the numbers. The principal P is $300. The rate r is 8%, which I think I need to convert to a decimal. So 8% divided by 100 is 0.08. Time t is 0.5 years. 

So I = 300 * 0.08 * 0.5. Let me compute that step by step. First, 300 multiplied by 0.08. 300 times 0.08 is 24. Then multiply that by 0.5. 24 times 0.5 is 12. So the interest would be $12.

Wait, let me double-check that. Another way to think about it is that 8% annually, so for half a year, it's 4%. 4% of 300 is 12. Yep, that matches. So the interest he'll pay is $12.

Looking at the options, option C is $12. So the answer should be C.

The interest George will pay on a 6-month loan of $300 at 8% interest is calculated using the simple interest formula:

\[ I = P \times r \times t \]

Where:
- \( P = \$300 \) (principal amount),
- \( r = 8\% = 0.08 \) (annual interest rate),
- \( t = \frac{6}{12} = 0.5 \) years (6 months converted to years).

Substituting the values:

\[ I = 300 \times 0.08 \times 0.5 = 12 \]

Thus, the interest George will pay is **$12**, corresponding to option C.
