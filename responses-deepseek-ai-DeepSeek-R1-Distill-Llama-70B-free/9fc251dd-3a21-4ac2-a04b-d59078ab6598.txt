Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about corn plant heights and polygenes. I'm a bit rusty on quantitative genetics, but let's try to break this down step by step.

The problem says that two races of corn have average heights of 48 and 72 inches. They're crossed, and the F1 generation averages 60 inches. Then, when 500 F1 plants are classified, two are 48 inches and two are 72 inches, the rest in between. The question is about finding the number of polygenes involved and how much each contributes.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with polygenic traits, the variation often follows a normal distribution, and the F1 might show some range if there are multiple genes involved. Wait, but the F1 generation here averages 60 inches, which is exactly midway between 48 and 72. That suggests that each parent contributes equally, so the F1 is a hybrid.

In a typical Mendelian monohybrid cross, the F1 would all be the same, but since this is polygenic, each gene contributes a certain amount to the height. So, the F1 plants are all 60 inches on average, but when they self, the F2 would show a range.

Wait, actually, in this case, the F1 plants are the ones showing variation. Oh wait no, the question doesn't say F2. It's the F1 plants that were classified. So 500 F1 plants have two at 48, two at 72, and the rest in between. So the F1 has a range of 48 to 72 inches, same as the parents.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. Usually, F1 might not be that variable unless it's a different type of cross. Wait, but if the parents are true-breeding for their respective heights, then the F1 should be uniform. But here the F1 varies. Maybe that's because each plant in the F1 has a certain number of dominant and recessive alleles. But wait, I thought F1 plants from a cross between two pure lines would all be the same, but maybe when multiple genes are involved, each F1 plant could have varying contributions from each gene.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Let me think again. Each parent is homozygous for their respective traits. So, for example, if each parent has a certain number of dominant (say, increasing height) and recessive alleles. But if they're pure lines, each parent would have all dominant or all recessive for each gene. So when crossed, each F1 would get a mix. But each F1 plant would have the same genotype for each gene. Wait, but if each gene contributes a certain amount, and each F1 has a certain number of dominant alleles, then their heights would vary based on that.

Wait, but in typical polygenic cases, each parent contributes a certain number of alleles, and the F1 would have a specific number. Let me think in terms of additive genes. Suppose each gene contributes a certain value, like 'a' inches per dominant allele. For example, if each dominant allele adds 'a' inches, then the parents might differ in the number of dominant alleles they have.

But wait, the parents are averaging 48 and 72. The F1 is 60, which is exactly in the middle. So that suggests that each parent contributes an equal number of dominant and recessive alleles in each gene. Hmm, but maybe each parent is homozygous for different alleles.

Wait, maybe each gene has two alleles, and each contributes a certain value. For example, suppose that each gene contributes a value of 'd' inches. Let's say the parents are homozygous for different alleles, so parent 1 has all recessive alleles (say, 'a' contributing less), and parent 2 has all dominant alleles (contributing more). So each of their F1 offspring would have one of each allele, so each gene would contribute (a + dominant) which is (a + (a + d))? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe each gene has a certain additive effect. So for each gene, the dominant allele adds a certain value. So the parents differ in the number of dominant alleles. Suppose parent 1 has 'aa' for each gene (so recessive homozygous), and parent 2 has 'AA' (dominant homozygous). Then the F1 would be 'Aa' for each gene. So each gene in F1 would contribute the average of A and a. Let's say each dominant allele contributes 'd' inches over recessive.

So for each gene, the F1 would have (d/2) added compared to the recessive. But if the parents are at 48 and 72, and F1 is 60, that's exactly the average. So each gene's F1 contribution is the average of the two parents.

Wait, but the F1's average height is 60 inches, which is the average of 48 and 72. So 48 + (60-48) = 12 inches difference, times the number of genes. Wait, no, perhaps the total difference is 24 inches (72-48=24), and the F1 is halfway, so 12 above the lower parent.

Wait, but in a typical additive model, if each gene contributes 'u' units, and there are 'n' genes, then the F1's height is the average of the two parents. So the total difference between the parents is 24 inches, so 2 times the sum of the effects of each gene's alleles.

Wait, perhaps each gene contributes a certain amount. Let me think: if each parent is homozygous but for different alleles, and each dominant allele contributes 'a' inches, then each parent would have a total contribution of n*a (if all dominant) or 0 (if all recessive). Wait, but in this case, parent 1 is 48, parent 2 is 72. So, the difference is 24 inches.

But wait, the F1 is the average, so each F1 has each gene as heterozygous. So each gene contributes (a/2) inches. Then the F1 height would be the average of the two parents, which is 60. Which is exactly what's observed.

But now, when the F1 plants are selfed, or when they produce gametes, the F2 would show segregation. Wait, but in this case, the F1 plants are the ones being measured. Oh, wait, no, the question says that 500 F1 plants were classified, with two at 48, two at 72, and the rest in between. That suggests that the F1 plants are varying, but I thought F1 from a cross between two pure lines would be uniform. Unless each F1 plant has a different number of dominant alleles. Wait, but that would require that each parent contributes a different number of dominant alleles. Wait, perhaps each parent is homozygous for a different number of dominant alleles across the polygenes.

Wait, perhaps each gene is contributing a certain amount. For example, each gene adds a fixed value when the dominant allele is present. So, if each parent has a different number of dominant alleles across the genes, the F1 would have a combination that averages the parents.

Wait, but the parents are pure lines, so each parent is homozygous for all their alleles. So each parent has, say, all dominant (so maximum height) or all recessive (minimum height). But in this case, perhaps the parents have different numbers of dominant alleles. For example, parent 1 has n dominant alleles, parent 2 has m dominant alleles, but wait, that doesn't make sense because each gene would be homozygous in each parent.

Wait, maybe each parent has a certain number of genes that are dominant. For example, parent 1 has k dominant alleles (each contributing a certain amount), and parent 2 has (n - k) dominant alleles. Hmm, but that's getting complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps each gene contributes a certain additive value. Suppose that each gene contributes 'd' inches when in the dominant state. So each parent is homozygous for either the dominant or recessive allele for all genes. Then, the F1 would be heterozygous for each gene, contributing d/2 per gene. So the total height of the F1 would be (number of genes * d/2).

But wait, the two parents would have different total heights based on their genotypes. Let's think: if parent 1 is recessive for all genes, their height would be, say, the base height, and each dominant allele adds 'd' inches. So parent 1's height is 48 inches, which is the base. Parent 2 has all dominant alleles, so their height is 48 + n*d, where n is the number of genes. Because each of the n genes contributes d inches when dominant.

Wait, but in that case, parent 2's height would be 48 + n*d =72. So n*d =24 inches.

The F1, being heterozygous for each gene, would have each gene contributing d/2 inches. So F1 height would be 48 + n*(d/2) =48 + (n*d)/2. But we know that n*d=24, so F1 height is 48 +12=60 inches. Which matches the given data.

So that's correct. Now, when F1 plants are selfed, each gene will segregate, and the F2 will have varying numbers of dominant alleles. But wait, in this question, it's the F1 plants that are varying. That's a bit confusing because F1 from a cross between pure lines should all be the same genotype. Unless perhaps the parents are not pure lines, but that's not stated.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The question says that two races of corn (so perhaps inbred lines) are crossed. So the F1 would all have the same genotype for each gene, so same phenotype. But that's not what's happening here. There's variation in the F1, so perhaps each F1 plant is not genetically identical. That suggests that each parent is not homozygous for all the genes, but perhaps each is a mixture. But that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the F1 plants are the result of a cross between two different inbred lines, each with different alleles. So each F1 plant is a hybrid, but if the parents are homozygous, then all F1 would be the same. But the problem shows that F1 varies. Hmm, so perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe the parents are not inbred lines. Or perhaps, the F1 plants are actually the result of a cross that allows for variation. Wait, but that's not typically how F1 works. Maybe the parents are not homozygous for each gene, so when crossed, the F1 can have different combinations. But the problem states that the parents are two races averaging 48 and 72 inches. So perhaps each race is a population with a certain distribution of alleles.

Wait, perhaps each race is a pure line for a different set of polygenes. So when crossed, each F1 plant gets one allele from each parent. But if each parent contributes a different set, then each F1 could have a different combination, leading to variation in height. But that doesn't quite make sense. Wait, maybe each race is fixed for a different allele at each locus. For example, race A is aa for gene 1, and race B is AA, so F1 is Aa for gene 1. Similarly for other genes.

But then all F1 plants would be Aa for each gene, so they should all have the same phenotype. So I'm a bit stuck here. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the F1 plants are not all identical because each gene contributes a different amount, so the variation comes from multiple genes. But the F1 in this scenario would have a specific set of genes, so their heights should be uniform. So why are there F1 plants varying in height?

Wait, perhaps the question is misstated, and it's actually the F2 generation. Because F2 would show segregation and variation. But the question explicitly says F1. Hmm.

Wait, maybe the F1 plants are actually the result of a cross between two different F1 plants. Or perhaps the initial cross was between two different pure lines, each contributing several alleles. Alternatively, perhaps each parent is heterozygous, so F1 can have varying combinations. But that complicates the initial setup.

Alternatively, perhaps each parent is homozygous for a different number of dominant alleles. For example, parent 1 has k dominant alleles, and parent 2 has (n -k) dominant alleles. But that's getting into a more complex model.

Alternatively, perhaps each gene contributes an additive effect, and the parents have different numbers of dominant alleles. So, for example, parent 1 has m dominant alleles across all genes, and parent 2 has n dominant alleles. Then, the F1 would have (m + n)/2 dominant alleles on average. But this is getting a bit unclear.

Wait, but in the problem, the F1 averages 60, which is the average of 48 and 72. So that suggests that each F1 plant is exactly intermediate. But the problem says that in 500 F1 plants, some are at the extremes (48 and 72 inches), which is the same as the parent's average. That's confusing because F1 plants should be uniform, unless there's something else going on.

Wait, perhaps the F1 plants are actually the result of a cross between the F1 and something else. Or perhaps the question is about F2, but it's stated as F1. Alternatively, maybe the parents are not pure lines but have some heterozygosity, allowing the F1 to vary.

Alternatively, maybe the F1 plants are actually the result of a cross between two F1 individuals, leading to F2, but that's not what the question says.

Wait, maybe I should approach this using the concept of polygenes and the range of variation. The F1 has a range from 48 to 72 inches, same as the parents. So the difference between the shortest and tallest F1 plant is 24 inches. The average is 60.

In polygenic traits, the range can be thought of as the total number of polygenes times the contribution per gene. So each polygene contributes a certain value, say 'd' inches. The maximum difference between the two parents would be n * d, where n is the number of polygenes. Because each gene contributes d inches when in the dominant state.

Wait, but earlier I thought that the difference between the parents is 24 inches, so n*d=24. And the F1 average is 60, which is the midpoint, so that's correct. Now, in the F1, when you have all the genes as heterozygotes, each contributes d/2 per gene. So the F1's height would be 48 + n*(d/2) =48 + 24/2=60, which matches.

But the problem says that the F1 plants have a range from 48 to 72. So the maximum and minimum in F1 are the same as the parents. That suggests that some F1 plants have all dominant alleles and others all recessive. But that's impossible unless the F1 plants are actually F2. Hmm, maybe the question is incorrect, but I have to work with it.

Wait, perhaps each F1 plant can have varying numbers of dominant alleles due to multiple genes. But F1 from a cross between pure lines would all have the same genotype. So perhaps the question is actually about F2. But the question says F1.

Alternatively, perhaps each F1 plant is heterozygous for each of the polygenes, and when they produce gametes, there's segregation, leading to variation in the F2. But again, the question is about F1.

Wait, maybe the question is a trick, and the F1 plants are actually the result of a cross between two different F1 plants, leading to F2, but that's not what's stated.

Alternatively, perhaps the parents are not pure lines. Suppose parent 1 is aa...aa (all recessive) and parent 2 is Aa...Aa (heterozygous for all genes). Then the F1 could have varying numbers of dominant alleles, leading to variation in height. But that's getting complicated.

But let's try to think about the data. The F1 has a range of 24 inches, same as the parents. The average is 60. So the maximum F1 plant is 72, and the minimum 48.

Wait, so the maximum possible would be when all polygenes are expressed as dominant, contributing their maximum d each. Similarly, the minimum when all are recessive. So the difference is n*d =24 inches.

So, n*d =24.

Now, when F1 plants are formed, perhaps each F1 plant can vary in the number of dominant alleles they inherit. Wait, but if the parents are pure lines, the F1 should have exactly half dominant and half recessive alleles. So perhaps the F1's height would be 48 + (n*d)/2 =60. Which fits, as (n*d)=24, so 24/2=12, 48+12=60.

But in that case, all F1 plants would be 60 inches, with no variation. So why are there plants at 48 and 72 inches?

Hmm, unless the F1 plants are not all the same. Maybe the parents are not pure lines, but have some variation. Alternatively, perhaps the F1 is actually the F2, but the question says F1.

Wait, perhaps the F1 plants are the result of a cross between two F1 plants, but that would be F2. Alternatively, perhaps each F1 plant is a chimera or something, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps each F1 plant has a different number of dominant alleles due to multiple genes. But in reality, F1 from a cross between two pure lines would have the same genotype for each gene, so same phenotype. So this is confusing.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the F1 is actually showing some variation due to environmental factors, but the question is about genetics, so that's probably not it.

Let me try a different approach. Let's think about the range of F1. The maximum and minimum are 72 and 48, same as the parents. So perhaps each F1 plant can have all dominant or all recessive alleles for each gene. But that's only possible if each F1 plant is homozygous for each gene, which would require the parents to be heterozygous. But that's not the case here.

Wait, maybe the number of polygenes can be determined by the range of the F1. The maximum is 72, minimum 48, average 60. So the range is 24 inches, which equals 2 times the average deviation. The standard deviation might be relevant, but I don't think that's needed here.

Alternatively, the number of polygenes can be determined by the fact that the F1 shows the same range as the parents, implying that each F1 plant has the same number of dominant alleles as one of the parents
