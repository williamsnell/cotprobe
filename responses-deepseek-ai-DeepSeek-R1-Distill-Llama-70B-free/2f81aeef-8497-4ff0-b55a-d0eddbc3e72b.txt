Question:

The price of a barrel of crude oil stands at $2 per barrel for a whole month. North Sea Wells is trying to decide how many barrels of oil a day it should extract to maximize profits. The cost of extracting x barrels of oil a day is C(x) = [{x^2} / {10,000}] + 500, where C(x) is in dollars. How many barrels of oil a day will maximize profits?

Options:

A: 12,500 barrels a day
B: 7,500 barrels a day
C: 30,000 barrels a day
D: 15,000 barrels a day
E: 10,000 barrels a day
F: 20,000 barrels a day
G: 2,500 barrels a day
H: 5,000 barrels a day
I: 25,000 barrels a day
J: 17,500 barrels a day

Okay, so I've got this economics problem here about maximizing profits for North Sea Wells when extracting crude oil. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

Alright, the price per barrel is $2, and they want to decide how many barrels to extract daily to maximize profits. The cost function is given as C(x) = (x²)/10,000 + 500, where x is the number of barrels extracted each day.

I remember that profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost. So I need to find both the revenue and the cost functions and then subtract them to get the profit function. Once I have that, I can find the maximum point, probably by taking the derivative and setting it to zero.

First, total revenue (TR) is price times quantity. The price is $2 per barrel, so TR = 2 * x. That makes sense.

The cost function is already given as C(x) = (x²)/10,000 + 500. So the total cost is that quadratic function.

Profit (π) is TR - C(x), which would be 2x - [(x²)/10,000 + 500]. Let me write that out: π = 2x - (x²/10,000) - 500.

To find the maximum profit, I need to find the value of x where the derivative of the profit function with respect to x is zero. So I'll take the derivative of π with respect to x.

The derivative of π would be dπ/dx = 2 - (2x)/10,000. Simplifying that, 2x/10,000 is x/5000. So dπ/dx = 2 - (x/5000).

Setting this derivative equal to zero to find the critical point: 2 - (x/5000) = 0. Solving for x, I get x/5000 = 2 → x = 2 * 5000 = 10,000 barrels per day.

Wait, but I should check if this is a maximum. Since the profit function is a quadratic that opens downward (because the coefficient of x² is negative), the critical point should indeed be a maximum. So x=10,000 is where profit is maximized.

Looking at the options, option E is 10,000 barrels a day. So the answer should be E.

To determine the number of barrels of oil North Sea Wells should extract daily to maximize profits, we start by defining the profit function. The total revenue (TR) is calculated as the price per barrel ($2) multiplied by the number of barrels extracted (x), giving TR = 2x. The total cost (C(x)) is provided as \( C(x) = \frac{x^2}{10,000} + 500 \). 

The profit function (\( \pi \)) is then given by:

\[
\pi = TR - C(x) = 2x - \left( \frac{x^2}{10,000} + 500 \right)
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\pi = 2x - \frac{x^2}{10,000} - 500
\]

To maximize profit, we take the derivative of the profit function with respect to \( x \) and set it to zero:

\[
\frac{d\pi}{dx} = 2 - \frac{2x}{10,000} = 2 - \frac{x}{5000}
\]

Setting \( \frac{d\pi}{dx} = 0 \):

\[
2 - \frac{x}{5000} = 0 \implies \frac{x}{5000} = 2 \implies x = 10,000
\]

This critical point corresponds to a maximum because the profit function is a downward-opening parabola (the coefficient of \( x^2 \) is negative). Therefore, the profit-maximizing extraction rate is 10,000 barrels per day.

From the given options, the correct answer is:

E: 10,000 barrels a day.

Answer: E
