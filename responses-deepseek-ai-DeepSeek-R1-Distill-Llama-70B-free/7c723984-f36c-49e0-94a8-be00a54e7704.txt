Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about mothers' memories regarding their children's developmental and social histories. Hmm, let me think through this.

The question is asking which aspect mothers' memories are most accurate about. The options are A through F, each covering different areas like interpersonal relations, child-rearing practices, academic performance, specific events and dates, motor development, and school relations.

From what I remember in psychology, maternal recall is a topic that's been studied. I think mothers tend to remember certain milestones better than others. For instance, physical development milestones like walking or tooth development. These are pretty concrete events, so maybe they're easier to recall accurately.

Wait, motor development and weight gain are option E. That makes sense because these are physical changes that happen in a sequence and are often tracked by parents, maybe even noted down sometimes. So mothers might have clearer memories of when their child started walking or sitting up.

On the other hand, things like specific events and dates (option D) might be less accurate because those details can get fuzzy over time. I mean, who remembers the exact date their toddler said their first word unless they wrote it down?

Child-rearing practices (B) and school relations (F) are more about the environment and daily interactions, which might be subject to more bias or forgetting. Academic performance (C) could vary a lot and might depend on the child's progress over time, which could be influenced by many factors, making it harder to recall accurately.

Interpersonal relations (A) are complex and can change over time, so remembering the specifics might be challenging. So I think option E, motor development and weight gain, is the most accurate area for mothers' memories.

The empirical literature suggests that mothers' memories are most accurate when recalling aspects of their children's development that are concrete and sequential, such as motor development and weight gain. These physical milestones are typically easier to track and remember compared to more abstract or variable factors like interpersonal relations, child-rearing practices, or academic performance. Specific events and dates may also be less accurately recalled over time due to memory degradation. Therefore, the best answer is:

E: motor development and weight gain

Answer: E
