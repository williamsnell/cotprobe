Question:

A corporation under the authority of a state statute sued to have condemned 1,000 acres of forested land owned by a timber company, which it planned to develop for use as a state recreational area. After a hearing, the state court ordered possession of the land surrendered to the corporation, upon deposit in court of a sum deemed adequate to cover damages that might be awarded. The timber company immediately commenced an action to enjoin the court-ordered sale of their property. Which of the following would be the best ground for upholding the state court's order?

Options:

A: The power of eminent domain may only be delegated directly to a private enterprise for a public related use or activity.
B: The power of eminent domain may only be delegated to a public authority through a legislative determination.
C: The injured party has not proved such irreparable injury to use as amounts to a "taking. "
D: The Fifth Amendment's power of eminent domain incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment as applicable to the states does not require that payment be made prior to condemnation of the property.

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about eminent domain. Hmm, I remember that eminent domain is the government's power to take private property for public use, provided they pay just compensation. But wait, there's more to it. 

The question says a corporation under state statute sued to have 1,000 acres condemned for a state recreational area. The court ordered the land surrendered upon depositing an adequate sum for damages. The timber company is fighting this with an injunction. The question is about the best ground to uphold the court's order.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the power can only be delegated directly to a private enterprise for a public use. I think the power is usually delegated to public entities, but maybe sometimes to private if it's for public purpose, like utilities. Not sure if that's the best fit here.

Option B states it may only be delegated to a public authority through legislative determination. That sounds more accurate because typically, eminent domain is exercised by public bodies, and the legislature has to authorize it. But the question involves a corporation under state authority, so maybe it's a public authority.

Option C says the injured party hasn't proved irreparable injury as a taking. But the issue is about the process of condemnation, not whether there's a taking. So maybe not the main point here.

Option D mentions the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, saying payment doesn't have to be made before condemnation. I recall that the usual process is that compensation is paid, but does it have to be before taking possession? Wait, under the Fifth Amendment, just compensation is required, but the timing of payment can vary. Some jurisdictions allow taking possession before full payment, as long as there's an adequate mechanism for determining compensation, like a deposit in court.

So here, the state court ordered possession upon deposit of an adequate sum. That sounds like the government doesn't have to wait for the payment to be finalized before taking the land. So the best ground would be that the Constitution doesn't require payment before condemnation, which is option D.

But wait, what about the delegation part? The corporation is acting under state authority. So the delegation of eminent domain power is proper if it's to a public authority. Option B says it must be to a public authority via legislative determination. The question says the corporation is under state statute, which implies legislative approval, so maybe that's correct. But the question is about upholding the order, which is about the processâ€”payment timing.

So the options focus on different aspects. The question is about the ground to uphold the order, which is about the procedure of taking before payment. So D would be the right choice because it's about the timing of payment, not the delegation.

Alternatively, if the delegation was improper, that would be a reason to strike down the order. But the question is asking for the best ground to uphold, so it's more about the process being correct, specifically regarding payment.

I think the answer is D.

The best ground for upholding the state court's order is that the Fifth Amendment's power of eminent domain, as incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment and applicable to the states, does not require payment to be made prior to the condemnation of the property. The court's order allowing possession upon deposit of an adequate sum aligns with the constitutional requirement of just compensation, even if payment is not finalized before taking possession. This makes Option D the correct choice.
