The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A business purchased a computer from a seller's web site. The purchase form had a prominent hyperlink connection to a page that contained "important additional terms and conditions of sale," but the purchaser did not access that page. The delivered product included the additional terms in writing, along with a bold-lettered notice requiring the purchaser to return the product within 30 days if it did not accept the stated terms and conditions. After 35-days, the business became dissatisfied with the computer, and sued the seller for breach of contract. The seller demanded that the dispute be decided by private arbitration as per the additional terms and conditions to the agreement. Is the purchaser legally bound to participate in arbitration?

Options:

A: No, because federal law requires that a company give 90 days for return and the 30-day provision was null and void.
B: No, because there was no contract formed due to the purchaser's lack of assent to the additional terms and conditions.
C: Yes, because by not returning the computer within 30 days, the purchaser was bound to the additional terms and conditions that were a part of the contract.
D: Yes, because the seller provided the additional terms and conditions in writing with the delivered product.
E: No, because the purchaser did not explicitly agree to the terms and conditions that include private arbitration.
F: Yes, because the purchaser was aware of the additional terms and conditions, despite not accessing them.
G: No, because the seller did not clearly communicate the additional terms and conditions to the purchaser.
H: Yes, because the additional terms and conditions were part of the contract, regardless of whether the purchaser read them or not.
I: No, because the seller did not obtain explicit consent from the purchaser for the additional terms and conditions.
J: Yes, because federal law requires that arbitration must be used to attempt an initial resolution with respect to sales that take place on the internet.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this contract law question. Let's see what the question is about. 

A business bought a computer from a seller's website. The purchase form had a prominent hyperlink to additional terms and conditions, but the purchaser didn't access that page. Then, when the product was delivered, it included those additional terms in writing, along with a notice in bold letters. The notice said the purchaser should return the product within 30 days if they didn't accept the terms. 

After 35 days, the business was unhappy and sued the seller for breach of contract. The seller is asking for arbitration based on the additional terms. The question is whether the purchaser is legally bound to participate in arbitration.

Hmm. So, the main issue here is whether the purchaser agreed to the additional terms and conditions, which include the arbitration clause. 

I remember that contract law requires mutual assent, meaning both parties must agree to the terms. But sometimes, especially with online purchases, people don't actually read all the terms. So, how does that work?

In this case, during the purchase, the form had a hyperlink to the terms. But the purchaser didn't click on it. Then, after delivery, the terms were included with the product, along with a return notice. So the question is about whether the purchaser is bound by those terms, even though they didn't agree to them during the purchase.

I think this relates to the concept of "shrinkwrap" or "browsewrap" agreements. Shrinkwrap is when you buy software and have to agree after opening it, often by tearing the wrapping. The courts have sometimes held that if you keep the product after having the chance to review the terms, you're bound by them.

In the case of ProCD v. Zeidenberg, the court upheld shrinkwrap licenses, saying that by using the software, the buyer agreed to the terms. But here, the terms were provided after the purchase, along with a return option.

So the seller gave the purchaser 30 days to return the product if they didn't accept the terms. But the purchaser didn't return it within those 30 days. So by keeping the computer beyond 30 days, did they implicitly agree to the terms?

I think that's the crux here. The business had the opportunity to return the product and didn't. So under the theory of "acceptance by conduct," they might be bound. Because they had the chance to reject and didn't, their keeping the product could be seen as acceptance of the terms.

Looking at the options:

Option C says yes because by not returning within 30 days, they were bound. Option D says yes because the seller provided the terms in writing. Option E says no because there was no explicit agreement. Option H says yes because the terms were part of the contract regardless of reading.

I think the correct approach is that the purchaser is bound because they didn't return the product. So the additional terms become part of the contract through their conduct. So the answer would be C.

Wait, but what about the initial purchase? Did the purchaser agree to the terms during the purchase? They didn't click on the hyperlink, so maybe no. But the terms were provided later with the product. So the initial contract was formed when the purchase was made, but the additional terms were added after delivery. So the question is whether those additional terms can be considered part of the contract.

Shrinkwrap cases often involve the terms being inside the packaging, and the buyer has to agree by opening or using the product. Here, the seller included the terms with delivery and gave a return period.

I think courts would find that the purchaser's retention beyond the 30 days constitutes acceptance. So the terms, including arbitration, are enforceable.

So the correct answer would be C: Yes, because by not returning the computer within 30 days, the purchaser was bound to the additional terms.

The question revolves around whether the purchaser is legally bound by the additional terms and conditions, including an arbitration clause, provided after the purchase. The key issue is whether the purchaser's failure to return the product within 30 days constitutes acceptance of those terms under contract law.

Contract law requires mutual assent, but in cases involving terms provided after purchase, courts often apply the concept of "acceptance by conduct." Here, the seller included the additional terms with the delivered product and provided a 30-day return period for rejection. By not returning the product within this timeframe, the purchaser's actions can be interpreted as implicit acceptance of the terms.

This aligns with legal precedents like *ProCD v. Zeidenberg*, where courts upheld that retention of a product after having the opportunity to review and reject terms constitutes acceptance. The purchaser's decision to keep the computer beyond 30 days likely binds them to the additional terms, including the arbitration clause.

Among the options provided, the correct answer is:

**C: Yes, because by not returning the computer within 30 days, the purchaser was bound to the additional terms and conditions that were a part of the contract.**

Answer: C
