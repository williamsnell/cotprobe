Okay, so I have this evidence question here about whether a newspaper issue should be admitted as evidence in a stock fraud case. Hmm, let me think through this step by step. 

The scenario is that an investor is suing a corporation for stock fraud. During the case-in-chief, the investor wants to introduce a newspaper to show the stock price on a particular day. The corporation's attorney objects, and I need to figure out if the evidence should be admitted or excluded and why.

First, I remember that evidence can be excluded for several reasons: hearsay, best evidence rule, etc. The newspaper is being offered to show the stock price. So, the stock price is probably relevant because it might show damages or the impact of the fraud.

Wait, the newspaper is out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, which is the stock price. So that makes it hearsay, right? But there are exceptions to hearsay. I need to think about which exception might apply here.

One possible exception is the business records exception under FRE 803(6). Business records are admissible if they were made at or near the time of the event, kept in the course of a regularly conducted activity, and certain other conditions. But wait, a newspaper isn't a business record of the corporation. It's a third-party publication. So maybe that exception doesn't apply here.

Another thought: there's an exception for market reports and similar publications under FRE 803(17). I think this applies when the report is published for the purpose of conveying information about market prices, like stock prices. So if the newspaper regularly publishes stock prices, which they do, then it might qualify under this exception. 

Wait, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me think again. The market reports exception would allow the admission of the stock price from the newspaper. So that would make the evidence admissible, right? 

Alternatively, could it be excluded under the best evidence rule? The best evidence rule (FRE 1002) says you need the original if you're proving the content of a writing. But here, the investor is offering the newspaper to prove the stock price, not the content of the newspaper itself. So maybe the best evidence rule doesn't apply. Because the stock price is a fact, not the content of a document. So H, which says it's excluded because it violates the best evidence rule, might not be correct.

What about the original document rule? Well, that's part of the best evidence rule, which as I thought earlier, might not apply here because the issue is about the fact (stock price) rather than the document's content. So F can be set aside.

So back to hearsay exceptions. The newspaper is hearsay, but if it falls under the market reports exception, then it's admissible. So option I says admitted under the market reports exception. That would make sense.

But wait, what about option B, which says admitted under the business records exception? I thought that applies when the record is made by someone in the regular course of business. The newspaper isn't the corporation's business record. So B is probably incorrect.

Option G says excluded because it doesn't fit any exception. That can't be right if the market reports exception applies.

So the possible correct options are either A, I, or maybe another exception. Option A just says it's relevant, but being relevant isn't enough; it needs to overcome hearsay. So A is probably incorrect.

So I think the correct answer is I: admitted under the market reports exception.

The question revolves around whether a newspaper issue showing a corporation's stock price on a particular day should be admitted as evidence in a stock fraud case. The investor seeks to introduce it to prove the stock price, which is relevant to the case. However, the evidence must overcome potential objections, particularly under the hearsay rule.

Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. The newspaper qualifies as hearsay because it is a third-party publication offered to establish the stock price. However, hearsay is admissible if it falls under an exception. 

The business records exception (FRE 803(6)) does not apply here because the newspaper is not a business record of the corporation but rather a third-party publication. The best evidence rule (FRE 1002) and the original document rule are also not applicable because the evidence is being offered to prove the stock price—a fact—and not the content of the newspaper itself.

The correct exception is the market reports exception (FRE 803(17)), which applies to publications that regularly convey market prices, such as stock prices in a newspaper. Since newspapers regularly publish stock prices for informational purposes, this exception allows the evidence to be admitted.

Options A, B, F, and G are incorrect because they either misapply the exceptions or fail to recognize the applicability of the market reports exception. Option I correctly identifies that the evidence should be admitted under the market reports exception.
