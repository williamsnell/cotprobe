Question:

The Extruded Plastics Company distributes overhead to each of its six departments according to the ratio of total overhead to the total direct labor costs. During January, the total overhead for the factory was $20,000; the total direct labor cost $140,000. Find the ratio to be applied to all departments. Then find the amount to be charged to the Quality Control Department whose direct labor costs for the month were $16,000.

Options:

A: $5,000
B: $2,285.71
C: $4,000
D: $4,285.71
E: $3,428.57
F: $1,142.86
G: $3,500
H: $1,000
I: $1,714.29
J: $2,857.14

Okay, so I've got this accounting problem here about the Extruded Plastics Company and how they distribute their overhead costs. Hmm, let me try to understand what they're asking.

Alright, the company has six departments, and they distribute overhead based on the ratio of total overhead to total direct labor costs. So in January, the total overhead was $20,000 and the total direct labor cost was $140,000. I need to find the ratio they use and then apply it to the Quality Control Department which had $16,000 in direct labor costs.

Wait, the ratio is total overhead divided by total direct labor, right? So that would be $20,000 divided by $140,000. Let me calculate that. 20k divided by 140k... I can simplify this. Both numbers can be divided by 10,000, so 2 divided by 14, which is 1/7. Oh wait, 2/14 is the same as 1/7, which is approximately 0.142857. So the ratio is 1/7, or roughly 14.2857%.

Now, this ratio is applied to each department's direct labor cost to determine their share of the overhead. So for the Quality Control Department, their direct labor was $16,000. I need to multiply this by the ratio.

Let me do that. $16,000 times 1/7. 16,000 divided by 7 equals... 7 goes into 16 twice (2*7=14), remainder 2. Bring down the next 0: 20 divided by 7 is 2 again, remainder 6. Next 0: 60 divided by 7 is 8 (7*8=56), remainder 4. Next 0: 40 divided by 7 is 5 (35), rem 5. Next 0: 50/7 is 7 (49), rem 1. So it's approximately 2,285.714285... So about $2,285.71.

Looking at the options, option B is $2,285.71. So that must be the correct answer.

Wait, let me double-check. Oh wait, sometimes in these problems people confuse the ratio as overhead per direct labor. Since the ratio is 20,000 / 140,000, which is 1/7, yes. So each department's allocation is their labor cost times 1/7. So 16,000 * (1/7)= 2,285.71.

Yep, that makes sense. So the answer should be B.
</think>

The ratio for distributing overhead is calculated as total overhead divided by total direct labor costs. For January, this is $20,000 ÷ $140,000, which simplifies to 1/7 or approximately 14.2857%. 

To find the amount charged to the Quality Control Department, multiply its direct labor cost ($16,000) by the ratio (1/7). This results in $16,000 ÷ 7 ≈ $2,285.71. 

Thus, the correct answer is:

B: $2,285.71
