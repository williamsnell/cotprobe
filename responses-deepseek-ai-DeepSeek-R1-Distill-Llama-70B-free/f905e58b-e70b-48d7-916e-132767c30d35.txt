Okay, so I've got this problem here about gas laws. I remember that when dealing with gases, there are these combined gas laws that relate pressure, volume, and temperature. Let me try to think this through step by step.

The problem says we start with 750 ml of gas at 300 torr and 50°C. Then it's heated, and the volume becomes 2000 ml at 700 torr. We need to find the final temperature.

Hmm, I think the combined gas law is P1V1/T1 = P2V2/T2. Oh wait, right, because it's the same amount of gas, so the ratio should hold. But wait, temperature has to be in Kelvin, right? Because you can't have negative temperatures in gas laws.

So first, I'll note down the given values. Initial pressure P1 is 300 torr, initial volume V1 is 750 ml, initial temperature T1 is 50°C. Oh wait, I need to convert that to Kelvin. So T1 is 50 + 273.15 = 323.15 K.

After heating, the pressure P2 is 700 torr, volume V2 is 2000 ml. We need to find T2.

Plugging into the formula: (300 torr * 750 ml) / 323.15 K = (700 torr * 2000 ml) / T2.

Wait, actually, since the units for pressure and volume are the same on both sides, they should cancel out. So the equation can be written as:

P1 * V1 / T1 = P2 * V2 / T2

Solving for T2: T2 = (P2 * V2 * T1) / (P1 * V1)

Let me compute each part. Let's plug the numbers in.

P2 is 700, V2 is 2000, T1 is 323.15. P1 is 300, V1 is 750.

So T2 = (700 * 2000 * 323.15) / (300 * 750)

Let me compute numerator and denominator separately.

First, numerator: 700 * 2000 = 1,400,000. Then multiply by 323.15. Hmm, 1.4e6 * 323.15. Let me approximate that. 1.4e6 * 300 is 420,000,000. 1.4e6 * 23.15 is about 1.4e6 * 20=28,000,000, plus 1.4e6 *3.15=4,410,000. So total is 420,000,000 + 28e6 +4.41e6 ≈ 452.41e6.

Denominator: 300 *750 = 225,000.

So T2 = 452.41e6 / 225,000. Let's compute that.

Divide 452,410,000 by 225,000. Let's see, 225,000 is 2.25e5. 452,410,000 is 4.5241e8.

4.5241e8 / 2.25e5 = (4.5241 / 2.25) * 1e3.

4.5241 ÷ 2.25. Let me compute that. 2.25 * 2 = 4.5. So 2.25 * 2 =4.5. So 4.5241 is a bit more. So 2.01 times approximately.

So 2.01 * 1e3 is 2010 K.

Wait, but wait—let me do the exact calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial approach.

Wait, 700 * 2000 = 1,400,000.

300 * 750 = 225,000.

So the ratio (700 *2000)/(300 *750) = (1400000)/(225000) = 1400000 ÷ 225000.

Divide numerator and denominator by 1000: 1400 /225. Let's compute that. 225 *6=1350. So 1400-1350=50. So 6 + 50/225 = 6 + 2/9 ≈6.222...

So 1400000/225000 = 6.222...

So now, T2 = (6.222...) * T1.

T1 is 323.15 K. So 6.222 * 323.15.

Wait, let's compute 6 * 323.15 = 1938.9, and 0.222 *323.15 ≈71.7. So total is approximately 1938.9 +71.7 = 2010.6 K.

Wait, but wait, 6.222 is 6 and 2/9. 2/9 is about 0.222.

Wait, so 6.222 * 323.15 = ?

Let me calculate this more accurately.

323.15 *6 = 1938.9

323.15 *0.222 = let's see: 323 *0.2 is 64.6, 323 *0.022 is around 7.106. So total 64.6 +7.106 =71.706. So total is 1938.9 +71.706 = 2010.606 K.

So T2 is approximately 2010.6 K. But wait, the question asks for the final temperature in Celsius, I think. Because the options are in Celsius.

So converting Kelvin to Celsius: T2 = 2010.6 K - 273.15 = ?

2010.6 - 273.15 = 1737.45 °C.

Looking at the options, option C is 1737°C. So the answer should be C.

Wait, let me double-check my steps because sometimes I might miscalculate.

Alternative approach: perhaps using the formula directly.

P1V1/T1 = P2V2/T2

So rearranged, T2 = (P2 V2 T1) / (P1 V1)

Plugging numbers:

P2=700, V2=2000, T1=323.15, P1=300, V1=750.

So:

T2 = (700 * 2000 * 323.15) / (300 *750)

Compute numerator: 700 *2000=1,400,000. 1,400,000 *323.15 = ?

Wait, 1,400,000 *300=420,000,000. 1,400,000 *23.15=?

1,400,000 *20=28,000,000; 1,400,000 *3.15=4,410,000. So total 28,000,000 +4,410,000=32,410,000.

So adding to 420,000,000: 420,000,000 +32,410,000=452,410,000.

Denominator: 300 *750=225,000.

So T2=452,410,000 /225,000 = ?

Divide numerator and denominator by 1000: 452410 / 225 ≈ let's compute this division.

225 * 2000= 450,000. So 452,410 -450,000=2410.

So 2000 + (2410 /225). 2410 ÷225 = approx 10.71.

So total is 2010.71 K.

Converting to Celsius: 2010.71 -273.15= 1737.56°C. So about 1737.6°C, which rounds to 1737°C, which is option C.

So I think the correct answer is C.

To solve the problem, we use the combined gas law:

\[
\frac{P_1 V_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2 V_2}{T_2}
\]

### Given:
- Initial pressure: \( P_1 = 300 \, \text{torr} \)
- Initial volume: \( V_1 = 750 \, \text{ml} \)
- Initial temperature: \( T_1 = 50^\circ \text{C} = 323.15 \, \text{K} \)
- Final pressure: \( P_2 = 700 \, \text{torr} \)
- Final volume: \( V_2 = 2000 \, \text{ml} \)
- Final temperature: \( T_2 = ? \)

### Step 1: Rearrange the formula to solve for \( T_2 \):
\[
T_2 = \frac{P_2 V_2 T_1}{P_1 V_1}
\]

### Step 2: Plug in the values:
\[
T_2 = \frac{(700)(2000)(323.15)}{(300)(750)}
\]

### Step 3: Simplify the numerator and denominator:
- Numerator: \( 700 \times 2000 = 1,400,000 \), and \( 1,400,000 \times 323.15 = 452,410,000 \)
- Denominator: \( 300 \times 750 = 225,000 \)

\[
T_2 = \frac{452,410,000}{225,000} \approx 2010.6 \, \text{K}
\]

### Step 4: Convert \( T_2 \) from Kelvin to Celsius:
\[
T_2 = 2010.6 \, \text{K} - 273.15 = 1737.45^\circ \text{C}
\]

### Step 5: Match the closest option:
The closest option to \( 1737.45^\circ \text{C} \) is **1737°C**.

### Final Answer:
**C**
