Okay, so I've got this problem here about the Harris foundry and their daily manufacturing costs. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the problem gives me a cost equation: C = 3m² + m + 9, where C is the total cost in dollars and m is the number of pieces produced. It says that by 9:00 am, the cost is $4,849. Then, the rate after 9 am is 10 pieces per hour. I need to find out how many pieces will have been produced by lunch hour, which is 12 noon. That gives me 3 hours from 9 am to 12 pm, so production time after 9 am is 3 hours.

Wait, no. Wait, from 9 am to 12 noon is 3 hours. So if the rate is 10 pieces per hour after 9 am, then in 3 hours, they would produce 10 * 3 = 30 pieces after 9 am. But wait, the question says "how many pieces of metal will have been produced by lunch hour". Hmm, does that mean the total up to lunch, including before 9 am, or just after 9 am? The problem says "the cost of the work produced by 9:00 am is $4,849". So the cost up to 9 am is $4849, which includes all the pieces made up to that point, say m1 pieces. Then from 9 am to 12 noon, they make additional pieces. So the total m at 12 noon is m1 + (10 * 3) = m1 +30.

So first, I need to find m1, the number of pieces produced by 9 am. Then add 30 to get the total by noon.

So, the cost at 9 am is given by C = 3m1² + m1 +9 = 4849.

Let me write that equation:

3m1² + m1 +9 = 4849

Subtract 4849 to set it to zero:

3m1² + m1 +9 -4849 = 0

Which simplifies to:

3m1² + m1 -4840 = 0

Now, I need to solve for m1. Using the quadratic formula as the hint suggests. The quadratic formula is m = [-b ± sqrt(b² -4ac)]/(2a). 

Here, a=3, b=1, c= -4840.

So discriminant D = b² -4ac = (1)^2 -4*3*(-4840) = 1 + 4*3*4840.

Calculate 4*3=12, 12*4840. Let me compute that:

First, 12 * 4800 = 57,600. Then 12 *40=480, so total 57,600 +480=58,080.

So D=1 +58,080 =58,081.

Hmm, sqrt(58,081) — I think that's 241, because 240² is 57,600, and 241² is (240+1)^2=240² +2*240*1 +1=57,600+480+1=58,081. Yes! So sqrt(D)=241.

So m1 = [-1 ±241]/(2*3). 

We can ignore the negative root because m can't be negative. So:

m1 = (-1 +241)/(6) = 240/6 =40.

So m1 is 40 pieces by 9 am. Then from 9 am to 12 noon, which is 3 hours, they produce 10 pieces per hour, so 3*10=30 more pieces. So total by noon is 40 +30=70.

Wait, but looking at the options, option F is 70. So the answer for part (i) is F.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to be sure I didn't make any mistakes.

So, the equation: 3m² +m +9=4849.

Subtract 4849: 3m² +m -4840=0.

a=3, b=1, c=-4840.

Discriminant D=1 +4*3*4840 = 1 +12*4840.

12*4840: Let me compute 10*4840=48,400. 2*4840=9,680. So total 48,400 +9,680=58,080. Adding 1 gives D=58,081. Square root of D is 241.

So m=( -1 +241 )/(6)=240/6=40. Correct.

So m1=40. Then from 9 to 12 is 3 hours, 10 per hour, 30 more. Total m=70. So the answer is F, 70 pieces.

As for part (ii), expressing the total cost as a function of t, where t is hours after 9 am. So, t=0 at 9 am, t=3 at 12 noon.

Total pieces produced by lunch (t=3) is m1 +10t.

But wait, m1 is 40. So total m(t) =40 +10t.

So the cost function C(t) would be based on m(t). So:

C(t)=3*(40 +10t)^2 + (40 +10t) +9.

But maybe the problem just wants C as a function of t without expanding. Alternatively, perhaps it's okay to write it as is.

But since part (ii) is not being asked here (but the question is part (i)), but the options are all for part (i), so I'm focusing on that.

So the answer is F:70 pieces.

To determine how many pieces of metal will have been produced by lunch hour (12 noon) at the Harris foundry, we start with the given cost equation:

\[
C = 3m^2 + m + 9
\]

where \(C\) is the total cost in dollars and \(m\) is the number of pieces produced. By 9:00 am, the cost is $4,849, so we set up the equation:

\[
3m_1^2 + m_1 + 9 = 4849
\]

Subtracting 4849 from both sides gives:

\[
3m_1^2 + m_1 - 4840 = 0
\]

Using the quadratic formula:

\[
m = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

where \(a = 3\), \(b = 1\), and \(c = -4840\), we calculate the discriminant:

\[
\Delta = b^2 - 4ac = 1 + 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 4840 = 1 + 58080 = 58081
\]

The square root of the discriminant is:

\[
\sqrt{58081} = 241
\]

Substituting into the quadratic formula:

\[
m_1 = \frac{-1 \pm 241}{6}
\]

Taking the positive root (since \(m_1\) cannot be negative):

\[
m_1 = \frac{-1 + 241}{6} = \frac{240}{6} = 40
\]

Thus, 40 pieces have been produced by 9:00 am. After 9:00 am, the foundry operates at a rate of 10 pieces per hour. From 9:00 am to 12:00 pm (3 hours), an additional:

\[
10 \cdot 3 = 30 \, \text{pieces}
\]

are produced. Therefore, the total number of pieces produced by 12:00 pm is:

\[
m = m_1 + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70
\]

The answer to part (i) is **70 pieces**.

For part (ii), expressing the total cost as a function of \(t\), where \(t\) represents the number of hours past 9:00 am, the total number of pieces produced by time \(t\) is:

\[
m(t) = 40 + 10t
\]

Substituting \(m(t)\) into the cost equation:

\[
C(t) = 3(40 + 10t)^2 + (40 + 10t) + 9
\]

However, since the question only asks for part (i), the final answer is:

**F: 70 pieces**

Answer: F
