Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about lenses. Hmm, I remember that when two lenses are in contact, their focal lengths combine in some way. Oh right, the equivalent focal length is found by adding the reciprocals or something like that. Wait, no, wait. Let me think.

I think the formula is 1/f_total = 1/f1 + 1/f2. Oh wait, no, wait. Because when lenses are in contact, the combined focal length is when you have two thin lenses in contact, the formula is 1/f = 1/f1 + 1/f2. But wait, wait, I might be mixing up something here.

Wait, no, I think that's correct. So each lens has its own focal length. The first one is a converging lens, which I believe has a positive focal length. The second is a diverging lens, which should have a negative focal length, right? Because converging lenses are positive in the sign convention I'm using, and diverging are negative.

So the first lens has f1 = +6 cm, since it's converging. The second is diverging, so f2 = -10 cm. Now, plugging into the formula: 1/f_total = (1/6) + (1/(-10)).

Let me calculate that. 1/6 is approximately 0.1667. 1/-10 is -0.1. Adding them together: 0.1667 - 0.1 = 0.0667. So 1/f_total is 0.0667, which means f_total is 1 / 0.0667. Let me compute that. 1 divided by 0.0667 is approximately 15. So f_total is around 15 cm.

Wait, wait, what's the sign? Because we have 1/f_total positive 0.0667, so f_total is positive. That would mean it's a converging lens. But wait, wait, wait. Because if I have a converging and a diverging lens, the result could be either converging or diverging, depending on the focal lengths.

Wait, let's check the calculation again. 1/6 is about 0.166666..., 1/-10 is -0.1. Adding them: 0.166666... -0.1 = 0.066666..., which is positive. So 1/f_total is positive, so f_total is positive 15 cm. So the equivalent lens is a converging lens with focal length 15 cm.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option I is 15 cm converging. So that would be the correct answer.

Wait a minute, but wait. I remember that the formula for two lenses in contact is 1/f = 1/f1 + 1/f2. But isn't that for when they are placed together in the same medium, like air? Yeah, I think that's correct. So I think I did it right.

So the answer should be I: 15 cm converging.

To determine the equivalent lens when a thin converging lens of focal length 6 cm is in contact with a thin diverging lens of focal length 10 cm, we use the formula for the combined focal length of two lenses in contact:

\[
\frac{1}{f_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1}{f_1} + \frac{1}{f_2}
\]

Here:
- \( f_1 = +6 \, \text{cm} \) (converging lens, positive focal length),
- \( f_2 = -10 \, \text{cm} \) (diverging lens, negative focal length).

Substituting the values:

\[
\frac{1}{f_{\text{total}}} = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{-10}
\]

\[
\frac{1}{f_{\text{total}}} = 0.1667 - 0.1 = 0.0667
\]

\[
f_{\text{total}} = \frac{1}{0.0667} \approx 15 \, \text{cm}
\]

The positive result indicates that the equivalent lens is a converging lens with a focal length of 15 cm. Among the given options, the correct choice is:

**I: 15 cm converging lens**
