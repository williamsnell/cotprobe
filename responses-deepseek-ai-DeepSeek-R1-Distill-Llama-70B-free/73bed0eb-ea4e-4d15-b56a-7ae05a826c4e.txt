Question:

A farmer owned a 40-acre tract of farmland located in a small southern town. The farmer leased the property and building thereon to a tenant for a term of seven years commencing on February 15, 2000 and terminating at 12:00 noon on February 15, 2007. The lease contained the following provision:"Lessee covenants to pay the rent of $5,000 per month on the 15th day of each month and to keep the building situated upon said leased premises in as good repair as it was at the time of said lease until the expiration thereof. " The lease also contained a provision giving the tenant the option to purchase 10 acres of the tract for $150,000 at the expiration of the lease term. Before the lease was executed, the farmer orally promised the tenant that he (the farmer) would have the 10-acre tract surveyed. During the last year of the lease, the tenant decided to exercise the option to purchase the 10 acres of the tract. Without the farmer's knowledge, the tenant began to build an irrigation ditch across the northern section of the property. When the tenant notified the farmer that he planned to exercise the option, the farmer refused to perform. The farmer also informed the tenant that he never had the 10-acre tract surveyed. If the tenant brings suit for specific performance, which of the following is the farmer's best defense?

Options:

A: The option agreement was unenforceable under the parol evidence rule.
B: The farmer's failure to survey the 10-acre tract excused him from further obligations under the contract.
C: The description of the property was too indefinite to permit the remedy sought.
D: The option was unenforceable because it lacked separate consideration.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about contract law, specifically regarding an option to purchase land and a tenant's right to specific performance. I need to figure out the correct answer, and I'll walk through my thought process step by step.

First, let me read the question carefully to understand the scenario.

The farmer leased his 40-acre property to a tenant for seven years starting February 15, 2000, ending at noon on February 15, 2007. The lease included a provision that the tenant would pay $5,000 monthly and keep the building in good repair. There's also an option for the tenant to buy 10 acres for $150,000 at the end of the lease. Before signing the lease, the farmer orally promised to survey the 10-acre tract. 

In the last year, the tenant decided to exercise the option but started building an irrigation ditch without the farmer's knowledge. When the tenant told the farmer about exercising the option, the farmer refused and said he never surveyed the land. Now, the tenant is suing for specific performance, and we need to determine the farmer's best defense from the options given.

The options are A through D, each presenting a different legal argument.

Let me break down the key points:

1. The lease includes an option to purchase 10 acres. The option was part of the written lease agreement, so it's a written contract. The farmer made an oral promise to survey the land before the lease was signed.

2. The tenant started building an irrigation ditch on part of the property without the farmer's knowledge, which might be a breach of the lease terms. The lease required the tenant to keep the building in repair but doesn't mention anything about alterations or improvements like ditches, unless there's an implied term against committing waste.

3. The farmer is refusing to perform the option, claiming he didn't survey the land as he had orally promised. The tenant is suing for specific performance.

I need to consider why the farmer would have a valid defense against specific performance.

Looking at the options:

Option A: The option agreement was unenforceable under the parol evidence rule.

The parol evidence rule states that prior oral agreements are not admissible to contradict a fully integrated written contract. However, the option to purchase was included in the written lease, so the parol evidence rule wouldn't apply to the option itself. The oral promise to survey might be considered, but I'm not sure if that affects the enforceability of the option agreement. Maybe this isn't the best defense.

Option B: The farmer's failure to survey the 10-acre tract excused him from further obligations under the contract.

The farmer's oral promise to survey was a pre-lease promise. If the lease didn't include this promise, it might not be part of the consideration. But the option was part of the lease, so the farmer's obligations under the option are separate from the survey promise. The tenant's exercise of the option doesn't necessarily depend on the survey being done unless the contract ties them together. So maybe the farmer's failure to survey isn't a valid defense. Unless the survey was a condition precedent to the option, but I don't see that in the facts. So B might not be the right defense.

Option C: The description of the property was too indefinite to permit the remedy sought.

The option is for 10 acres of a 40-acre tract. The problem is whether this description is specific enough. Specific performance requires that the property can be identified. If the lease doesn't specify which 10 acres, and the farmer didn't survey, then perhaps the description is too vague. The tenant might not be able to precisely identify the land, making specific performance impossible. So this could be a valid defense. The court might say that without a clear description, they can't enforce the option.

Option D: The option was unenforceable because it lacked separate consideration.

Options to purchase usually require consideration to be enforceable. In this case, the option was part of the lease agreement. The tenant was paying rent and maintaining the property, which could serve as consideration for the option. So the option likely had sufficient consideration. Therefore, D might not be a good defense because there was consideration in the lease.

So, evaluating each option:

- A: Parol evidence rule probably doesn't apply because the option was in the written lease. The oral promise to survey might not affect the enforceability of the option itself.
- B: Farmer's failure to survey might not excuse him because the lease didn't make the survey a condition of the option.
- C: The description being too indefinite could prevent specific performance because the court can't identify exactly which 10 acres to transfer.
- D: The option had consideration as part of the lease, so D is not a strong defense.

Therefore, the best defense is option C: The description of the property was too indefinite to permit the remedy sought.

The question revolves around a dispute over an option to purchase 10 acres of land included in a lease agreement. The tenant is suing for specific performance after the farmer refused to honor the option. To determine the farmer's best defense, each option must be analyzed:

- **Option A**: The parol evidence rule applies to prior oral agreements that contradict a written contract. However, the option to purchase was part of the written lease, so the parol evidence rule does not render the option unenforceable. This is not the best defense.

- **Option B**: The farmer's failure to survey the land was based on an oral promise made before the lease was executed. Since the lease did not make the survey a condition of the option, the farmer's failure to survey does not excuse him from fulfilling the option. This is not a strong defense.

- **Option C**: The description of the property as "10 acres" of a 40-acre tract may be too vague to permit specific performance. For specific performance to be granted, the property must be clearly identified. Without a survey or specific designation of the 10 acres, the court may find the description insufficiently definite. This is a valid and strong defense.

- **Option D**: The option was part of the lease agreement, and the tenant's obligations under the lease, such as paying rent and maintaining the property, provided sufficient consideration for the option. Therefore, the option was enforceable, and this is not a strong defense.

The best defense is **Option C**, as the lack of a specific description of the 10 acres undermines the tenant's ability to seek specific performance.

**Answer: C**
