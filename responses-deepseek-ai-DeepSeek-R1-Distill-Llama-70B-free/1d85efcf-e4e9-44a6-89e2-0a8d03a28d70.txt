Okay, so I have this question about individuals with moderate mental retardation. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what I know about mental retardation categories.

I remember that mental retardation, now more commonly referred to as intellectual disability, is categorized into four levels: mild, moderate, severe, and profound. Each has different characteristics regarding cognitive functioning and adaptive behaviors.

The question is asking about individuals with moderate mental retardation. The options are from A to J, so I need to pick the correct statements about them.

First, I'll try to remember the characteristics of each level. Mild intellectual disability: people can often learn academic skills up to about 6th grade, can work, and live independently with some support. Moderate is the next level. 

I think moderate intellectual disability means an IQ between approximately 36-51 (if I recall the ranges correctly). These individuals might have more difficulty in school but can learn basic communication and some academic skills. They can perform simple tasks with supervision.

Looking at the options:

A: Usually display advanced cognitive abilities despite their condition. No, that doesn't sound right. Moderate retardation wouldn't mean advanced abilities.

B: Make up the majority of the mentally retarded population. Wait, I think the majority is actually mild. Because moderate is less common than mild. So B might not be correct.

C: Can live independently without supervision. No, I think they need some support. Moderate probably can't live completely on their own.

D: Typically unable to participate in unskilled work. That doesn't seem right. I think they can do unskilled work, but they might need supervision.

E: Often acquire academic skills up to a post-secondary level. No, that's way too high. They probably don't reach that level.

F: Constitute 2% - 3% of the mentally retarded population. Hmm, I thought the distribution is mild being the largest group. Moderate would be maybe around 10%, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, wait, I think the distribution is: mild is about 85-90%, moderate about 10%, severe 5%, profound less. So F says 2-3% which sounds too low for moderate.

G: Can be trained to perform unskilled work under close supervision. That sounds familiar. I think moderate individuals can do simple tasks with supervision, so G might be correct.

H: Display significant impairment in all areas of functioning. I'm not sure. Moderate impairment might be more in specific areas, but not all. Or maybe it's significant in several areas.

I: Display minimal or no impairment in sensorimotor functioning. Sensorimotor refers to the integration of sensory input and motor functions. I think moderate retardation doesn't necessarily cause sensorimotor issues, but I might be mixing this up with other conditions.

J: Usually acquire academic skills up to approximately eighth-grade level. Wait, I thought mild retardation gets up to 6th grade, moderate maybe up to 2nd or something? Or maybe it's about functional skills rather than academic. Or perhaps J is correct because I might be mixing up the specifics.

Wait, let me think again. For mild intellectual disability, academic skills might go up to about 6th grade. Moderate might be lower, maybe up to 2nd grade. Or perhaps up to about 7th or 8th? I'm a bit confused here.

Looking back at the options, option G says they can perform unskilled work under close supervision. That rings a bell. I think moderate intellectual disability means they can work, but need supervision.

Option J says academic skills up to 8th grade. That seems high for moderate. I think moderate is more like up to early elementary levels, maybe 2nd grade? So J might not be correct. Alternatively, maybe it's about having some basic skills.

Option B: make up the majority. No, I'm pretty sure mild is the majority. So B is wrong.

Option F: 2-3%. No, moderate is more like 10% of the intellectually disabled population.

Option D: unable to do unskilled work. No, I think they can, with supervision. So D is incorrect.

Option G is correct. So G is a correct statement.

Wait, another point: sensorimotor functioning. Option I says minimal or no impairment. I'm not too sure, but I think sensorimotor is more about physical and sensory skills. Intellectual disability doesn't necessarily mean sensorimotor issues, unless there's a co-occurring condition.

So I think option G is correct. Also, looking at the options, H says significant impairment in all areas. I think that's for more severe levels. Moderate might have more specific impairments, not all areas.

So the correct answer should be G and J? Wait, no. Wait, the question says "which of the following is true". So now I'm a bit confused between G and J.

Wait, another thought: Moderate intellectual disability. Their IQ is 36-51. They can learn some basic communication, and during school age, they can learn basic skills and some academic skills. But up to what level? I think they can learn up to about 2nd grade academically, but maybe in terms of functional skills, they can go a bit higher.

Wait, the options for academic skills are E and J. E says post-secondary, which is way too high. J says 8th grade. I'm starting to think that J may not be correct because moderate might not reach that. But perhaps it's about having some skills, not necessarily formal education.

Alternatively, I'm getting myself confused. Maybe I should look for other clues in the options.

Option I: minimal or no impairment in sensorimotor. That might be more accurate, as sensorimotor is not directly tied to intellectual functioning unless other issues are present.

Wait, but the question is about moderate mental retardation. So, sensorimotor functioning would typically be within normal limits unless there's another condition. So I might be correct.

Putting it all together:

The correct statements would be G and I. But looking at the options, the question is a multiple-choice with single answer, so perhaps one of them is correct.

Wait, the options are each separate, so the question is looking for which of the options is correct.

So looking again, the question asks which statement is true about individuals with moderate mental retardation.

Option G: can be trained to perform unskilled work under close supervision. That seems correct.

Option J: usually acquire academic skills up to 8th grade. I'm not sure, but I think that's too high. Maybe it's more like 2nd grade.

So the correct answer would be G.

Alternatively, another point: Moderate intellectual disability is characterized by being able to perform unskilled work under supervision. So G is correct.

Another option to consider is B: make up the majority. No, because mild is the majority.

So the correct answer is G.

Individuals with moderate mental retardation (now more commonly referred to as moderate intellectual disability) typically have an IQ between 36-51. They can learn basic communication and some academic skills, often up to an early elementary level. They can perform unskilled work but require close supervision. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. Moderate intellectual disability does not involve advanced cognitive abilities.  
- **B**: Incorrect. Mild intellectual disability is the most common, not moderate.  
- **C**: Incorrect. These individuals cannot live independently without supervision.  
- **D**: Incorrect. They can participate in unskilled work under supervision.  
- **E**: Incorrect. Academic skills are not acquired up to a post-secondary level.  
- **F**: Incorrect. Moderate intellectual disability constitutes around 10% of the intellectually disabled population, not 2-3%.  
- **G**: Correct. These individuals can be trained to perform unskilled work under close supervision.  
- **H**: Incorrect. Significant impairment is not present in all areas of functioning.  
- **I**: Incorrect. Sensorimotor functioning is typically not impaired unless co-occurring conditions exist.  
- **J**: Incorrect. Academic skills are generally limited to early elementary levels, not up to 8th grade.  

The correct answer is **G**, as it accurately reflects the ability of individuals with moderate intellectual disability to perform unskilled work under supervision.

Answer: G
