Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about telescopes and their lenses. Hmm, I remember that telescopes typically use two lenses: an objective lens and an eyepiece lens. The objective has a longer focal length compared to the eyepiece. Wait, wait, no, I think it's the opposite. Oh right, no, the objective usually has a longer focal length. Because the objective collects more light and forms an image, and the eyepiece then magnifies that image.

The question says the focal lengths are 5 cm and 1 cm. So I'm guessing the 5 cm is the objective and 1 cm is the eyepiece. But wait, I'm not entirely sure. Oh right, in refracting telescopes, the objective has a longer focal length than the eyepiece. Because the eyepiece is used to focus the image from the objective, so a shorter focal length makes sense for higher magnification.

So part a asks what the distance between the lenses should be when both the object and the final image are very far away. I remember that when the object is at infinity, the image formed by the objective is at its focal point. Then, the eyepiece is used to take that image and form it at infinity again, making the final image virtual and at infinity.

Wait, no, wait. For a telescope, when both object and image are at infinity, the lenses are spaced such that the image formed by the objective is at the focus of the eyepiece. Oh right, because then the eyepiece acts like a magnifying glass, producing a virtual image at infinity.

So the distance between the lenses (the separation) should be the sum of their focal lengths. Because the objective's focal length (f1) is the distance from the objective to the image, which is then the focus of the eyepiece. So f1 + f2.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, if the image from the objective is at its focal point, then the eyepiece's focus needs to be at that point. So the eyepiece is placed such that its focal point coincides with the image from the objective. So the distance between the two lenses is f1 (objective) + f2 (eyepiece). Oh wait, no, because the eyepiece is placed so that its first focal point is where the image from the objective is. So the separation between the lenses is f1 + f2.

Wait, in the case of a Galilean telescope, is it different? Oh wait, no, I think that for a Keplerian telescope, which uses two convex lenses, the separation is indeed f1 + f2. So in this case, f1 is 5 cm, f2 is 1 cm. So 5 + 1 = 6 cm. So the separation is 6 cm.

Now, part b is about the magnification. The magnification of a telescope is given by the ratio of the focal lengths. Specifically, the magnification M is equal to - (f1/f2). The negative sign indicates that the image is inverted.

So f1 is 5 cm, f2 is 1 cm. So M is -5/1 = -5 times. So the magnification is 5 times, inverted. So the image is inverted and magnified 5 times.

Looking at the options, looking for separation 6 cm and magnification 5 times. Let's see the options:

Option I: 6 cm, 5 times.

But wait, the options mention 'times' without a negative. So the magnification given is the absolute value. So the magnification is 5 times, and the image is inverted.

So the correct answer would be option I: 6 cm, 5 times.

Wait, but looking back at the options: Option I is "6 cm, 5 times." So that's correct.

Alternatively, I should double-check the formula for magnification. Oh right, the magnification M of the telescope is M = -(f1 / f2). So that's correct, which gives -5. So the magnification is 5 times, and inverted. So the answer should be I.

A telescope consists of two lenses: an objective lens with a longer focal length and an eyepiece lens with a shorter focal length. The question specifies focal lengths of 5 cm and 1 cm, so the objective lens has a focal length of 5 cm, and the eyepiece lens has a focal length of 1 cm.

### Part (a): Distance Between the Lenses
When both the object and the final image are very far away, the image formed by the objective lens is at its focal point, and the eyepiece lens is positioned such that this image lies at its focal point. This configuration ensures that the final image is virtual and at infinity. The distance between the lenses is therefore the sum of the focal lengths of the two lenses:  
\[
\text{Distance between lenses} = f_1 + f_2 = 5 \, \text{cm} + 1 \, \text{cm} = 6 \, \text{cm}.
\]

### Part (b): Magnification
The magnification of a telescope is given by the formula:  
\[
M = -\frac{f_1}{f_2}.
\]
Substituting the given focal lengths:  
\[
M = -\frac{5 \, \text{cm}}{1 \, \text{cm}} = -5.
\]
The negative sign indicates that the image is inverted, but the magnification is typically reported as its absolute value. Thus, the magnification is 5 times.

### Final Answer
The distance between the lenses is 6 cm, and the magnification is 5 times. Comparing this with the options, the correct choice is:  
**I: 6 cm, 5 times.**
