Okay, so I have this economics problem here, and I'm a bit confused about how to approach it, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about the money supply and how changes in demand deposits affect it. I remember that the money supply, M, is composed of cash and demand deposits. The public holds a fraction C = (1/21) of M in cash and d = (20/21) of M in demand deposits, D. So, M = C + D. But wait, here, D is 20/21 of M, and C is 1/21. So that makes sense because 1/21 + 20/21 = 21/21 = 1, so together they add up to M.

The bank is required to keep a reserve ratio r of 1/5 of its deposits. I think that means the bank must hold r times its deposits as reserves, which are not loaned out. So the reserves, R, would be r*D = (1/5) D. The rest of the deposits are loaned out, right? So the loans (or bank credit) would be D - R = D - (1/5 D) = (4/5 D). 

Wait, but how does this relate to the money supply? I think when banks make loans, they increase the money supply. Because when someone takes a loan, the bank credits their account, which is a demand deposit. So the initial change in D would lead to an increase in loans, which in turn increases the money supply.

But the question is about the change in M when D increases. So, if D increases by some amount, delta D, how much does M increase? There's a formula given in the question: delta M = [1 / ( (1/21) + (1/5)(20/21) ) ] * delta D. Let me compute that denominator first.

Let's calculate the denominator. The first part is 1/21. The second part is (1/5) multiplied by (20/21). So (1/5)*(20/21) = 20/(5*21) = 4/21. So adding that to 1/21 gives (1 + 4)/21 = 5/21. So the denominator is 5/21. So 1 divided by (5/21) is 21/5. So delta M is (21/5) * delta D. So part a) is (21/5) delta D. 

Wait, but looking at the options, option A has (21/5) delta D for part a). So that's correct. Let's check part b) now. It says the change in demand deposits is 4 delta D. Wait, delta D is the initial change? Or is delta D the change in demand deposits, but then how does that relate to the change in the money supply?

Hmm, maybe I should think in terms of the money multiplier. The money multiplier is the factor by which an increase in the monetary base (or in this case, perhaps the initial deposit) leads to an increase in the money supply. The formula for the money multiplier when there are both cash and deposits is 1/(c + r), where c is the cash-to-money ratio and r is the reserve ratio. Wait, but in this case, c is (1/21), and r is (1/5). So the multiplier would be 1/(1/21 + (1/5)(20/21)) ), which is exactly the denominator we calculated earlier, giving 21/5. So delta M = (21/5) delta D.

But wait, how does part b) come into play? Part b) says the change in demand deposits is 4 delta D. Wait, that doesn't make immediate sense. Let me think again. Suppose that the initial change is an increase in demand deposits by delta D. But because of the reserve requirements, the bank can only lend out a portion of that. So the total increase in deposits would be more than delta D because of the multiplier effect.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the initial change in D as delta D, and the total change in D would be some multiple of that. Alternatively, maybe I should model it using the equations.

Let me try to model the system. Let’s denote the initial money supply as M. So M = C + D. The cash C = (1/21) M, and D = (20/21) M. The bank holds R = (1/5) D as reserves, so R = (1/5)(20/21 M) )= (4/21) M. The loans made by the bank, L, are D - R = (20/21 M - 4/21 M) = 16/21 M. 

Now, if demand deposits increase by delta D, that's an injection into the banking system. But the money supply doesn't just increase by delta D; it increases by more because the banks can lend out the excess reserves. So the initial delta D leads to an increase in reserves by (1/5) delta D, and the rest (4/5 delta D) is lent out, which in turn becomes additional deposits when the borrowers spend the money. 

Wait, but perhaps I should think about the entire process. Let me try to approach this using the money multiplier concept.

The money multiplier formula is usually 1/(r + c), where r is the reserve ratio and c is the cash-to-deposit ratio. Wait, no, the standard formula is 1/(reserve ratio) when considering deposits only, but when considering cash holdings, it's a bit different.

Wait, the money multiplier considering both cash and reserve requirements is 1/(c + r), but I'm not entirely sure. Let me check the formula. The money multiplier when the public holds cash and banks hold reserves is given by:

Money Multiplier = 1 / [ (c) + r*(1 - c) ) ]

Wait, perhaps. Because c is the fraction of M held as cash, so (1 - c) is the fraction held as deposits. The reserve ratio applies to deposits, so the denominator would be c + r*(1 - c).

In this problem, c is 1/21, r is 1/5. So the denominator is (1/21) + (1/5)(1 - 1/21). Let's compute that.

First, compute 1 - 1/21 = 20/21.

So, denominator = (1/21) + (1/5)(20/21) = (1/21) + (20/105) = (1/21) + (4/21) = 5/21.

So the multiplier is 1/(5/21) = 21/5, which matches what we had before. So delta M = (21/5) delta D.

But wait, delta D here is the initial change in deposits. But in this case, the initial change is actually the change in the monetary base, perhaps, or maybe an exogenous change in D. So when D increases by delta D, M increases by (21/5) delta D.

But part b) says the change in demand deposits is 4 delta D. Hmm, that seems confusing. Let me think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that when the money supply increases by delta M, demand deposits change by some multiple. But I'm not sure. Let me try to model it.

Suppose that initially, M = C + D = (1/21)M + (20/21)M. Now, suppose that D increases by delta D. How does this affect M?

Wait, but M is total money, which includes both C and D. So if D increases, M must increase as well. But the exact relationship depends on how the increase in D affects C and the reserves.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the change. Let delta D be the change in D, and delta C be the change in C, and delta M = delta C + delta D.

The public's cash holdings are a fraction of M, so delta C = (1/21) delta M. Similarly, the demand deposits are delta D = (20/21) delta M. Wait, no, because the public's holdings of cash and demand deposits are always fractions of the total money supply. So if M increases, then both C and D increase proportionally.

But wait, that's only if the public's preferences (the fractions) don't change. So in this problem, the fractions are fixed. So any change in M would result in a proportional change in C and D. So if M increases by delta M, then C increases by (1/21) delta M, and D increases by (20/21) delta M.

Wait, but that would mean that delta D = (20/21) delta M, so delta M = (21/20) delta D. But that's not matching the earlier result. Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up things.

Wait, no, because the initial change is in D, which leads to a change in the entire M, which in turn affects C and D. So perhaps the correct approach is to consider that an increase in D leads to a change in M, and that change in M causes D to increase further because of the fractions.

Alternatively, perhaps I should model the system with equations.

Let’s denote the change in M as delta M. Then, the change in cash is delta C = (1/21) delta M, and the change in demand deposits is delta D_total = (20/21) delta M. But the initial increase in D is some delta D_initial, which triggers a chain reaction leading to delta D_total being larger than delta D_initial.

But I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should use the money multiplier approach again. The money multiplier is 21/5, so delta M = (21/5) delta D_initial.

But then, the change in demand deposits would be (20/21) delta M, because all money is either cash or demand deposits. So delta D_total = (20/21) * (21/5) delta D_initial = (20/5) delta D_initial = 4 delta D_initial. So part b) says the change in demand deposits is 4 delta D, which would be correct. So if delta D is the initial change, then the total change in D is 4 times that. So part b) is 4 delta D.

Wait, but the question defines delta D as the change in D. So if the initial increase is delta D, then the total increase in D would be 4 delta D. But that doesn't seem to align because the money supply increases, leading to a proportionate increase in D. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the definitions.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial change is not in D, but in the monetary base or something else. Let me try to think again.

Wait, perhaps the way to approach it is by considering that the change in D (delta D) causes a change in reserves, which affects the lending capacity of banks, leading to a change in M.

The bank's required reserves are r times deposits. So if D increases by delta D, the required reserves increase by (1/5) delta D, and the excess reserves, which can be lent out, increase by delta D - (1/5 delta D) = (4/5) delta D.

When the bank lends out the (4/5) delta D, this amount gets deposited again, leading to a further increase in deposits. So this process continues, leading to a multiplier effect.

The total increase in deposits would be delta D_initial * [1 / (1 - (1 - r) * (1 - c)) ].

Wait, let me recall the formula for the deposit multiplier when there's both a reserve requirement and cash drain. The formula is 1 / [ (r) + (c) * (1 - r) ) ].

Wait, that might not be correct. Alternatively, the multiplier can be calculated by considering that each new deposit leads to a reserve requirement and some cash leakage.

Wait, maybe it's better to model it step by step.

1. Let’s assume that the initial increase in D is delta D. This could be from, say, an injection of cash into the economy, like the central bank buying government bonds, which increases D.

2. The bank must hold r = 1/5 of this delta D as reserves, so reserves increase by (1/5) delta D.

3. The remaining (4/5) delta D can be lent out. When this loan is made, the borrower deposits the money back into the bank, increasing D by (4/5) delta D.

4. Now, this new (4/5) delta D in D requires the bank to hold (1/5)(4/5 delta D) = (4/25) delta D as reserves. The rest can be lent out again, which is (4/5)(4/5 delta D) = (16/25) delta D.

5. This process continues, leading to a geometric series.

The total increase in D would be the sum of all these increments: delta D + (4/5) delta D + (16/25) delta D + ... and so on.

This is a geometric series where each term is multiplied by (4/5). The sum is delta D * [1 / (1 - 4/5)] = delta D * (1 / (1/5)) ) = 5 delta D.

Wait, but that's the total increase in D. But wait, according to our earlier calculation using the money multiplier, delta M was (21/5) delta D. And since delta D is (20/21) delta M, that would imply delta D = (20/21)(21/5 delta D_initial) )= 4 delta D_initial. Which would align with part b) saying change in D is 4 delta D.

Hmm, but now I'm getting conflicting results. Because when I compute the sum of the geometric series, I get that the total increase in D is 5 delta D_initial. But according to the money multiplier approach, the change in D is 4 delta D_initial.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the initial terms. Let me clarify. Let me denote:

- Let delta D_initial be the initial change in D (from some exogenous factor, like the central bank).

- The total change in D would then be delta D_total = delta D_initial + delta D_secondary, where delta D_secondary is the result of banks lending out the excess reserves.

In the first step, when D increases by delta D_initial, the bank can lend out (4/5) delta D_initial. This loan becomes a new deposit, so D increases by (4/5) delta D_initial. But now, from this new deposit, the bank must hold (1/5) of it as reserves, so they can only lend out (4/5) of (4/5 delta D_initial), which is (16/25) delta D_initial, and so on.

So the total increase in D would be delta D_initial * [1 + (4/5) + (4/5)^2 + (4/5)^3 + ...] which is a geometric series with sum = 1 / (1 - 4/5) ) = 5. So delta D_total = 5 delta D_initial.

But according to the money multiplier approach, delta M = (21/5) delta D_initial, which would make delta D_total = (20/21) * (21/5) delta D_initial = 4 delta D_initial. Which is a contradiction.

Wait, something's wrong here. Let me try to find where I went wrong.

In the money multiplier approach, the money supply increases by delta M = (21/5) delta D_initial. Since D is 20/21 of M, the change in D would be (20/21) delta M = (20/21)*(21/5) delta D_initial = 4 delta D_initial. So the change in D is 4 delta D_initial. But according to the step-by-step lending approach, the change in D is 5 delta D_initial. So these two results are conflicting.

I must have made a mistake in one of the approaches. Let me check again.

In the money multiplier formula, the multiplier is 1/(c + r), where c is the cash-to-money ratio and r is the reserve ratio. So here, c = 1/21, r = 1/5. So denominator = (1/21) + (1/5) = (5 + 21)/(21*5) )= 26/105. So the multiplier is 105/26 ≈ 4.038, which doesn't match our earlier calculation. Wait, no, that's not correct because r is applied to deposits, not the entire money supply. So perhaps the correct denominator is c + r*(1 - c), since only deposits require reserves.

Compute denominator: c + r*(1 - c) = (1/21) + (1/5)(1 - 1/21) = (1/21) + (1/5)(20/21) = (1/21) + (4/21) = 5/21. So the multiplier is 21/5, as before. So delta M = (21/5) delta D_initial.

Then, the change in D is (20/21) delta M = (20/21)*(21/5) delta D_initial = 4 delta D_initial. So that's correct.

But why does the step-by-step approach give a different answer? Because I think in the step-by-step approach, I considered the initial delta D_initial as an exogenous increase, but perhaps that's not accurate because when the central bank increases D by delta D_initial, it does so by adding to the monetary base, which includes both cash and bank reserves. So perhaps the initial delta D_initial is not just a change in D but also affects the cash.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the initial injection. Let me think again. The initial injection could be in the form of cash, which would increase C, but in the problem, the increase is in D.

Alternatively, the problem says the public always holds C = (1/21) M and D = (20/21) M. So when M increases, both C and D increase proportionally. Therefore, when D increases by delta D, M increases by (21/20) delta D. But that doesn't fit with the earlier approach.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises because the initial change in D is not the same as the change in the monetary base. Let me try to model it correctly.

Suppose that the central bank increases the monetary base by delta B. The monetary base (high-powered money) is the sum of cash in circulation (C) and bank reserves (R). So, delta B = delta C + delta R.

But the public's cash holdings are C = (1/21) M. So any increase in C would require an increase in M. Similarly, bank reserves R are determined by the reserve ratio: R = r*D = (1/5) D.

When the central bank increases the monetary base by delta B, this can be done through an open market operation where the central bank buys government
