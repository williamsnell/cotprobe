Question:

Let l = [1,2,2,3,4]. In Python3, what is a possible output of set(l)?

Options:

A: {2,3,4}
B: {1}
C: {1,4}
D: {1,2,2,3,4}
E: {1,2,2,3,4,4}
F: {4,3,2,2,1}
G: {1,2,3}
H: {2,2,3,4}
I: {1,2,3,4}

Okay, so I have this question here about Python sets. The list l is [1,2,2,3,4], and I need to find what the set of l would be. Hmm, I remember that sets in Python are unordered collections of unique elements. Oh right, so when you convert a list to a set, it removes any duplicate elements.

So looking at the list l, the elements are 1, 2, 2, 3, 4. The duplicates are the two 2s. So when I create a set from l, those duplicates should be gone, leaving each element once. So the set should have 1, 2, 3, 4.

Wait, but the order doesn't matter in sets. So the actual output could be in any order, but the elements are the same. Now looking at the options:

Option I is {1,2,3,4}, which matches exactly. Let me check the other options. Option G is {1,2,3}, which is missing 4, so that's wrong. Option A is missing 1. Option D and E have duplicates, but sets don't allow duplicates, so those can't be right. Option H has two 2s, which also isn't possible. Option F includes duplicates in the ordering, but the actual set doesn't care about order and won't have duplicates anyway.

So the correct answer should be option I.

The correct answer is:

I: {1,2,3,4}

Set(l) removes duplicates and contains unique elements from the list. The list [1,2,2,3,4] becomes a set with elements {1,2,3,4}.

Answer: I
