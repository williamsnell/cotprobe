Question:

A landscaper agreed to maintain the yard of a homeowner for six months for a fee of $300 per month, payable at the end of the six-month period. This amount was the fair market value of the work to be performed. The landscaper performed the work for four months but was then offered another job for $500 per month and, after notifying the homeowner, stopped doing the promised work and took the other job. The homeowner refused to pay the landscaper anything. The homeowner could have hired a comparable landscaper to complete the work for $300 per month. In a lawsuit between the landscaper and the homeowner, what is the likely result?

Options:

A: The landscaper will recover $900 for the work done before the breach.
B: The homeowner will recover $500, which is the cost of hiring a new landscaper.
C: The homeowner will recover $300, which constitutes the unjust enrichment of the landscaper.
D: The landscaper will recover $1,500 for the work done before the breach.
E: The landscaper will recover $1,800, considering the new job offer.
F: The homeowner will recover $1,200, which is the cost of completing the work at prevailing market rates.
G: The homeowner will recover $400, which constitutes the unjust enrichment of the landscaper.
H: Neither the landscaper nor the homeowner will recover, because neither has suffered any loss.
I: The landscaper will recover $1,200 for the work done before the breach.
J: The homeowner will recover $600, which is the cost of completing the work at prevailing market rates.

Okay, let's try to work through this problem step by step. So, the question is about contract law, specifically dealing with a breach of contract and the remedies available. 

First, let's read the facts carefully. The landscaper agreed to maintain the homeowner's yard for six months at $300 per month, with the total fee being $300 per month. Wait, actually, the payment is $300 per month, but it's payable at the end of the six-month period. So, the total fee would be $1,800, paid after six months.

The amount they agreed on, $300 per month, is the fair market value for the work. So, that's important because it sets a benchmark for the value of the services.

Now, the landscaper performed the work for four months. So, they've done 4/6 of the work. But then, they were offered another job for $500 per month and decided to stop the work after notifying the homeowner. So, the landscaper breached the contract by stopping work before the six months were up.

The homeowner refused to pay anything. So, the issue is about what each party can recover in a lawsuit.

The question is asking what the likely result is between the landscaper and the homeowner.

So, the possible options are from A to J, each suggesting different outcomes.

Let me think about the applicable contract law principles here. When a contract is breached, the non-breaching party is entitled to damages. The goal is to put them in the position they would have been had the contract been fulfilled.

In this case, the homeowner is the non-breaching party because the landscaper stopped performing.

The landscaper has partially performed the contract by working four months. Normally, for partial performance, the party can recover the value of the services rendered, minus any damages the other party suffered due to the breach.

Wait, but wait, the payment was to be made at the end of six months. So, the landscaper hasn't been paid yet. The homeowner is refusing to pay anything, but the landscaper has done four months of work.

But the landscaper breached the contract by stopping. So, the issue is whether the homeowner has to pay for the work done, and whether the landscaper can claim anything.

Wait, but let me think again. The general rule is that when a contractor (like the landscaper) breaches a contract by not completing performance, the employer (homeowner) can recover damages. The contractor, however, can't recover for the partial performance if the breach is material. But sometimes, if the breach is not material, they can recover for the work done.

Wait, maybe I should recall the doctrine here. When a contractor is in breach, the employer can recover their actual damages, which would be the cost to complete the work minus what they would have paid under the original contract.

Wait, another way: the measure of damages for the employer is the difference between what they would have paid under the contract and what they have to pay to get someone else to finish the work. Or, if the work isn't completed, perhaps it's the cost to complete.

In this case, the homeowner could have hired another comparable landscaper for $300 per month. Since the original contract was $300/month, and the replacement is also $300, the cost to complete doesn't increase. So, the homeowner doesn't have additional costs, right?

Wait, no, the original payment was to be $300 per month for six months, totaling $1800. The landscaper worked four months, so under the contract, the homeowner would have paid for all six months. But since the landscaper stopped, the homeowner had to hire someone else for the remaining two months. But the replacement cost is $300 per month, same as before. So, the homeowner's loss is zero because they would have paid the same amount anyway. So, the homeowner isn't out any extra money.

Wait, but what about restitution? If the landscaper did four months of work, maybe they can recover the value of those four months under the theory of unjust enrichment. But wait, the payment wasn't due until the end. So, the landscaper hasn't been paid yet, and the contract was for the full six months. So, maybe the landscaper isn't entitled to payment because they didn't complete the contract. But they did perform part of it, so can they recover for that?

Hmm. In cases where a party breaches a contract, they can't recover for partial performance if the breach is material. But if the breach is minor, they might still recover. But here, the breach is stopping performance, which is a material breach because they didn't complete the work.

Wait, but another angle: when a contractor (like the landscaper) is fired for cause, i.e., because they breached the contract, the employer doesn't have to pay for the work done. But if the employer terminates the contract without cause, then the contractor can recover for the work done up to that point.

Wait, in this case, the landscaper is the one who breached. So, the homeowner can treat the contract as breached and not pay anything. But the question is whether the homeowner owes the landscaper for the work done.

Wait, no, because the payment was contingent on completing the six months. So, if the landscaper didn't complete, the payment isn't due. But sometimes, the law allows recovery for the benefit conferred under restitution, even if the contract isn't completed.

Wait, the concept here is "quantum meruit," which allows recovery for the value of services rendered, even without a formal contract, based on unjust enrichment. If the landscaper has conferred a benefit, the homeowner would be unjustly enriched if they didn't pay for it.

So, the landscaper could argue that they should be paid for the four months of work, even though they breached the contract by stopping. But wait, can they recover in quantum meruit when they have breached the contract?

I think generally, if a party breaches a contract, they can't recover for partial performance under the contract, but they might still be able to recover in quantum meruit if the other party was enriched by their services.

Wait, but in this case, the contract was for six months, and the payment was at the end. So, the landscaper didn't have a right to payment until the end. But they did four months of work, so perhaps they can recover for that under quantum meruit, because the homeowner received four months of services.

But wait, the contract was for the whole six months. If the landscaper didn't complete, the contract wasn't fulfilled, so the payment wasn't due. However, the homeowner still received four months of work, so perhaps the landscaper can recover the fair market value of those four months.

Wait, the fair market value was stated as $300 per month, same as the contract. So, four months would be $1,200. So, the landscaper might be able to recover $1,200 under quantum meruit.

But wait, the homeowner is refusing to pay anything. So, in the lawsuit, the landscaper would sue for the $1,200, and the homeowner might counterclaim for any damages.

What are the homeowner's damages? They had to hire someone else for the remaining two months. But since the replacement cost is the same as the original contract ($300 per month), the homeowner's total cost remains $1,800. So, the homeowner didn't suffer any additional loss. Therefore, their damages would be zero.

Wait, but the original contract's total was $1,800. The landscaper did four months, so if the homeowner hires another for two months, they pay another $600. But they were going to pay $1,800 regardless. So, the total remains the same. Hence, the homeowner didn't lose any money.

So, in this case, the landscaper can recover $1,200 for the four months of work, and the homeowner can't recover any damages because they didn't incur any extra costs.

Wait, but let me think again about the payment terms. The contract says the fee is $300 per month, payable at the end of six months. So, the total is $1,800, paid at the end. So, the landscaper hasn't been paid anything yet. They performed four months, then stopped.

So, the question is whether the landscaper can recover for the four months under quantum meruit. The other option is that the homeowner can deduct any damages from the amount owed. But since the homeowner didn't suffer any loss, the landscaper should be able to recover the $1,200.

Looking at the options, option I says "The landscaper will recover $1,200 for the work done before the breach." So that would make sense.

But wait, let me make sure. Another angle is that the landscaper is the one who breached, so the homeowner can choose to terminate the contract and not pay anything. But the law allows the breaching party to recover for the work done in some cases. 

Wait, but in some cases, the non-breaching party can offset any damages against the payment. But in this case, since the homeowner didn't have any extra costs, the offset would be zero.

Alternatively, the rule is that the breaching party can recover the value of the services minus any damages the non-breaching party suffered. But if the non-breaching party didn't suffer any loss, then the breaching party can recover the full value.

So, yes, the landscaper can recover $1,200.

Looking back at the options:

Option I: The landscaper will recover $1,200 for the work done before the breach.

That seems to fit.

Wait, but let me check other options. Option A is $900, which is 3 months times $300. That doesn't make sense because four months is $1,200.

Option D is $1,500, which is five months, which isn't right.

Option I is $1,200, which is correct.

So, the answer should be I.
</think>

The landscaper agreed to maintain the homeowner's yard for six months at $300 per month, with the total fee of $1,800 payable at the end of the six-month period. The landscaper performed the work for four months but then breached the contract by stopping work to take a higher-paying job. The homeowner refused to pay anything, and the issue is whether the landscaper can recover for the work done and whether the homeowner can recover any damages.

Under contract law, when a party breaches a contract, the non-breaching party is entitled to damages to place them in the position they would have been had the contract been fulfilled. However, the breaching party may recover for the value of the services rendered under the doctrine of quantum meruit, which prevents unjust enrichment.

Here, the landscaper performed four months of work, and the fair market value of those services was $300 per month, totaling $1,200. The homeowner did not suffer any additional loss because they could hire another landscaper at the same rate ($300 per month) to complete the remaining two months of work. Therefore, the homeowner's damages are zero, and the landscaper is entitled to recover the value of the work performed before the breach.

The correct outcome is that the landscaper will recover $1,200 for the work done before the breach.
