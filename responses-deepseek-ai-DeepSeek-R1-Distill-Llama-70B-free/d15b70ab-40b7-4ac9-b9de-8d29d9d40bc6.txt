Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about molecules with two energy levels. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The problem says the energy levels are nondegenerate and separated by 6000 cm⁻¹. Oh right, nondegenerate means each level has a degeneracy of 1, so no need to worry about that complicating things. Wait, or does it mean that each level has only one possible state? Yeah, I think that's right.

The measurements show there are 8 times more molecules in the ground state than the upper state. So the ratio of ground state population (N1) to the upper state (N2) is 8 to 1. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, if N1 is the ground state and N2 the excited, then N1 is 8 times N2. So N1/N2 = 8.

I remember the Boltzmann distribution is relevant here. The formula is N2/N1 = g2/g1 * exp(-ΔE/(kT)), right? Oh right, where g is the degeneracy. Since the levels are nondegenerate, g1 and g2 are both 1. So their ratio is 1, which simplifies things.

So the equation becomes N2/N1 = exp(-ΔE/(kT)). Wait, but here N1 is bigger than N2 by a factor of 8, so N1/N2 is 8. Let me rearrange the equation. 

If N2/N1 = exp(-ΔE/(kT)), then 1/(N1/N2) = exp(-ΔE/(kT)). So since N1/N2 is 8, 1/8 = exp(-ΔE/(kT)).

Taking natural log on both sides: ln(1/8) = -ΔE/(kT). Oh wait, ln(1/8) is ln(1) - ln(8) which is 0 - ln(8) = -ln(8). So -ln(8) = -ΔE/(kT). The negatives cancel out, so ln(8) = ΔE/(kT).

Then, T = ΔE/(k ln(8)). 

Wait, what's the value of ΔE? Oh, the energy separation is given as 6000 cm⁻¹. But wait, in spectroscopy, energy in cm⁻¹ is equivalent to wavenumbers. So 1 cm⁻¹ is about 1.986e-23 J. Or wait, because E = hcν̃, where ν̃ is in cm⁻¹. 

So h is Planck's constant, c is speed of light. Let me think about the exact value. h is approximately 6.626e-34 J·s. c is about 3e8 m/s. So 1 cm⁻¹ corresponds to E = h*c/(λ), where λ is in cm. Wait, but ν̃ is 1/λ, so E = h*c*ν̃. So 1 cm⁻¹ = 6.626e-34 * 3e8 m/s * (1 cm⁻¹). Wait, cm is 0.01 meters, so 1 cm⁻¹ is 1/(0.01 m) = 100 m⁻¹. So E = h*c*ν̃ where ν̃ is in m⁻¹. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Alternatively, I remember that 1 cm⁻¹ is approximately 1.986e-23 J. So 6000 cm⁻¹ would be 6000 * 1.986e-23 J.

Let me compute that. 6000 * 1.986e-23 = 6e3 * 1.986e-23 = Approximately 1.1916e-19 J.

Wait, but maybe there's a simpler way. Sometimes, in these problems, you can use the relation ΔE = k T, but scaled by the ratio. Alternatively, I remember that the energy in terms of wavenumbers (cm⁻¹) can be converted into Kelvin using the conversion factor. Let me think. 

The conversion factor from cm⁻¹ to Kelvin is roughly 1.44 because k (Boltzmann constant) is about 1.38e-23 J/K, and h c is about 1.986e-23 J·cm. So 1 cm⁻¹ = (h c) * (wavenumber) = 1.986e-23 J·cm * (1/cm) )= 1.986e-23 J. So 1 cm⁻¹ = 1.986e-23 J. Then, to get energy in terms of k*T, ΔE = k T. So T = ΔE/(k). 

Wait, but in this case, the energy is 6000 cm⁻¹, so ΔE = 6000 * 1.986e-23 J. So T would be that divided by k.

Wait, no, wait. Because in the Boltzmann equation, the exponent is -ΔE/(kT). So in the equation we had T = ΔE/(k ln(8)).

Wait, no, the equation was T = ΔE/(k ln(8)). Oh wait, let me write this correctly.

From earlier: ln(8) = ΔE/(k T), so T = ΔE/(k ln(8)).

So substituting ΔE as 6000 cm⁻¹ converted to J.

So first, compute ΔE:

ΔE = 6000 cm⁻¹ * (1.986e-23 J/cm⁻¹) = 6000 * 1.986e-23 J.

Let me calculate that: 6000 * 1.986e-23 = (6e3) * (1.986e-23) = 1.1916e-19 J.

Then, k is 1.38e-23 J/K.

So T = (1.1916e-19 J) / (1.38e-23 J/K * ln(8)).

Wait, ln(8) is natural log of 8. Since 8 is 2³, ln(8)=3 ln(2). And ln(2) is about 0.693, so 3*0.693 = approx 2.079.

So ln(8) ≈ 2.079.

So plugging in the numbers:

T = (1.1916e-19) / (1.38e-23 * 2.079)

First compute denominator: 1.38e-23 * 2.079 ≈ 2.868e-23.

So T ≈ 1.1916e-19 / 2.868e-23 ≈ (1.1916 / 2.868) * 1e4.

Calculating 1.1916 / 2.868: Let me do that division.

1.1916 divided by 2.868.

Hmm, 2.868 goes into 1.1916 how many times? Let's see: 2.868 * 0.415 is approximately 1.19.

Wait, 2.868 * 0.4 = 1.1472, 0.41*2.868= approx 1.175, 0.415*2.868= 1.190 (because 0.01 * 2.868 is 0.02868, so 0.4 is 1.1472, 0.015 is 0.04302; so 1.1472 + 0.04302= 1.19022). So yeah, 0.415 gives about 1.19022, which is very close to 1.1916. So approximately 0.415.

So 0.415 * 1e4 is 4150 K.

Looking at the options, option F is 4152 K. That looks like the answer.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.

Another approach: Let me compute the denominator 1.38e-23 * ln(8) more accurately.

ln(8) is exactly ln(2^3) = 3 ln 2 ≈ 3 * 0.69314718 ≈ 2.07944.

So 1.38e-23 * 2.07944 = 1.38 * 2.07944e-23.

1.38 * 2.07944: Let's compute 1 * 2.07944 is 2.07944, 0.38*2.07944 is about 0.790188. So total is approximately 2.07944 + 0.790188 = 2.869628e-23.

So denominator is 2.8696e-23.

So T = 1.1916e-19 / 2.8696e-23 = (1.1916 / 2.8696) * (1e-19 / 1e-23) = (approx 0.415) * 1e4 = 4150 K.

So that's about 4150 K, which matches option F: 4152 K.

So the answer should be F.

To determine the temperature of the collection of molecules, we use the Boltzmann distribution:

\[
\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right),
\]

where \( N_1 \) and \( N_2 \) are the populations of the ground and upper states, respectively, \( \Delta E \) is the energy separation, \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant, and \( T \) is the temperature. The problem states that \( N_1/N_2 = 8 \), so:

\[
\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \frac{1}{8}.
\]

Substituting this into the Boltzmann equation:

\[
\frac{1}{8} = \exp\left(-\frac{\Delta E}{kT}\right).
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln\left(\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{\Delta E}{kT}.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\ln(8) = \frac{\Delta E}{kT}.
\]

Rearranging for \( T \):

\[
T = \frac{\Delta E}{k \ln(8)}.
\]

The energy separation \( \Delta E \) is given as \( 6000 \, \mathrm{cm}^{-1} \). Converting this to joules:

\[
\Delta E = 6000 \, \mathrm{cm}^{-1} \times 1.986 \times 10^{-23} \, \mathrm{J \cdot cm} = 1.1916 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{J}.
\]

The Boltzmann constant \( k \) is \( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \mathrm{J/K} \), and \( \ln(8) \) is approximately \( 2.079 \). Substituting these values:

\[
T = \frac{1.1916 \times 10^{-19}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23} \times 2.079}.
\]

First, calculate the denominator:

\[
1.38 \times 10^{-23} \times 2.079 = 2.8696 \times 10^{-23}.
\]

Now divide:

\[
T = \frac{1.1916 \times 10^{-19}}{2.8696 \times 10^{-23}} = \frac{1.1916}{2.8696} \times 10^4.
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\frac{1.1916}{2.8696} \approx 0.415.
\]

Thus:

\[
T \approx 0.415 \times 10^4 = 4150 \, \mathrm{K}.
\]

Comparing this result to the options, the closest match is \( 4152 \, \mathrm{K} \), which corresponds to option F.
