Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about auditing, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

The question says that after issuing a report on audited financial statements, a CPA discovers that the accounts receivable confirmation process missed some material accounts. So, what should the CPA do immediately?

Hmm. I remember that when an auditor finds out after the report is issued that there was a mistake in their procedures, they have to take some action. But what exactly?

The options are A through H. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: Withdraw the auditor’s report from those relying on it. I think withdrawing the report is a possibility, but I'm not sure if that's the immediate step. I remember something about the auditor informing the client and maybe the audit committee first.

Option B: Contact the legal department. Well, maybe the CPA would do that eventually, but it doesn't seem like the immediate action. The first step would be to address the audit issue, not legal stuff right away.

Option C: Request the client to reconfirm all accounts receivable. That might be part of the solution, but if the omission is material, just reconfirming might not be enough, especially if the report is already out. Maybe the auditor needs to do more verification themselves.

Option D: Ignore it. No way, because it's material. The CPA can't just ignore it; they have a responsibility to ensure the financials are correct.

Option E: Resign from the engagement. Resigning might be an option if the issue is severe, but I'm not sure that's the immediate step. Maybe after trying to fix the problem first.

Option F: Amend the financial statements without telling anyone. That's unethical and illegal. The CPA can't just change things secretly.

Option G: Issue a revised auditor's report. That sounds possible. If the original report was based on incomplete information, the auditor might need to revise it. But I think the first step would be to perform additional procedures to confirm the balances before changing the report.

Option H: Perform alternative procedures to verify the account balances. Oh, right! When the auditor misses something, like not confirming some material accounts, they should do alternative procedures. So, for example, if they couldn't confirm some accounts, they might look at subsequent collections or other evidence to verify the balances.

Wait, so the immediate action would be to check those accounts. If the confirmation process omitted material accounts, the auditor can't just rely on the initial incomplete confirmation. They need to do something else to verify those accounts receivable.

So the correct action is H: Perform alternative procedures. Because the CPA needs to verify the omitted accounts to see if the financial statements are still accurate.

But wait, what if those alternative procedures show that the accounts are not as stated? Then the auditor might have to issue a revised report or withdraw the original one. But the immediate step is to gather more evidence.

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer should be H.

The CPA should perform alternative procedures to verify the account balances.

Answer: H
