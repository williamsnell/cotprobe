Question:

A 1-kg object is released from rest at the top of a rough-surfaced incline. The object slides without rotating to the bottom of the incline. The object’s kinetic energy at the bottom must be

Options:

A: Equal to the block’s gravitational potential energy when it was released, because total mechanical energy must be conserved.
B: Equal to zero, because the object loses all its energy due to the roughness of the incline.
C: Less than the block’s gravitational potential energy when it was released, because the work done by the friction force must be greater than the block’s gain in kinetic energy.
D: Greater than the block’s gravitational potential energy when it was released, because the object gains energy from the friction on the rough incline.
E: Greater than the block’s gravitational potential energy when it was released, because the kinetic energy increases as the object slides down the incline.
F: Less than the block’s gravitational potential energy when it was released, because the gravitational potential energy was converted both to thermal energy and to kinetic energy.
G: Equal to the block’s gravitational potential energy when it was released, because the object does not lose any energy while sliding down.
H: Less than the block’s gravitational potential energy when it was released, because the object loses energy due to the air resistance.
I: More than the block’s gravitational potential energy when it was released, because the object gains speed while sliding down.
J: Equal to the block’s gravitational potential energy when it was released, because the gain in kinetic energy compensates for the mechanical energy lost to thermal energy on the rough incline.

Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an object sliding down a rough incline. Hmm, let me see. The question is about the kinetic energy at the bottom compared to the gravitational potential energy it had at the top. I remember something about energy conservation and friction. 

So, the object is 1 kg and it's released from rest. Oh right, when it's at the top, it has gravitational potential energy (GPE) because of its height. The formula for GPE is mgh, where m is mass, g is gravity, and h is height. So initially, all the energy is GPE, right?

Now, when it slides down, if there were no friction, all that GPE would convert into kinetic energy (KE) at the bottom. Because in a frictionless case, mechanical energy is conserved. But wait, the problem says the incline is rough, so there must be friction acting on the object. Friction does work against the motion, which means it takes some of the energy away as heat, right?

So, the object isn't just converting GPE into KE; some of that energy is lost as thermal energy due to friction. That means the KE at the bottom can't be equal to the initial GPE. It has to be less than that. 

Looking at the options, let's see. Option A says equal because mechanical energy is conserved. But no, because mechanical energy isn't conserved in the presence of non-conservative forces like friction. So A is wrong.

Option B says zero because all energy is lost. That doesn't make sense. The object is moving, so it must have some KE. B is out.

Option C says less because friction's work is greater than the KE gain. Wait, friction's work is actually equal to the force of friction times the distance, which would be the loss. So if the KE is the GPE minus the work done by friction, then KE is less than GPE. So C is a possibility.

Option D says greater because friction adds energy. No, friction takes away energy, it doesn't add. So D is wrong.

Option E says greater because KE increases as it slides. But without considering where that energy comes from, this could be misleading. Since the object starts from rest, KE increases, but not beyond the initial GPE because of friction. So E's reasoning is flawed.

Option F says less because GPE goes into both thermal and KE. That makes sense. Because GPE is split between KE and heat, so KE must be less than initial GPE. So F is looking correct.

Option G says equal because no energy loss. But the incline is rough, so energy is lost. So G is wrong.

Option H says less because of air resistance. The problem specifies a rough surface, not air resistance, so H is not the right reason.

Option I says more because it gains speed. Again, friction would prevent KE from exceeding GPE. So I is wrong.

Option J says equal because KE compensates for the loss. That can't be right because friction causes a net loss in mechanical energy, so KE can't compensate and end up equal.

So, between C and F. Let me think again. The initial GPE is mgh. The work done by friction is the frictional force times the distance, which is the length of the incline. So the KE at the bottom is GPE minus the work done by friction. So KE is less than GPE. Both C and F say KE is less than GPE.

Wait, what's the difference between C and F? Option C says the work done by friction is greater than the gain in KE. Wait, no. The work done by friction is actually equal to the energy lost, which would be the initial GPE minus the final KE. So the work done by friction is (mgh - KE). So the work done by friction is greater than the KE only if mgh is more than twice the KE, but that's not necessarily the case here. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct reasoning is that GPE is split into KE and heat. So the KE must be less than the initial GPE. So option F is correct because it correctly explains that GPE was converted to both KE and thermal, making KE less.

So the answer should be option F.
</think>

When a 1-kg object is released from rest at the top of a rough-surfaced incline, it initially has gravitational potential energy (GPE) given by \( mgh \), where \( m \) is the mass, \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \( h \) is the height. As the object slides down, this GPE is converted into kinetic energy (KE). However, because the incline is rough, friction acts as a non-conservative force, causing some of the energy to be lost as thermal energy.

In the absence of friction, all the GPE would be converted into KE at the bottom, and mechanical energy would be conserved. But with friction, the KE at the bottom is less than the initial GPE because a portion of the energy is dissipated as heat. This means the KE at the bottom cannot equal or exceed the initial GPE.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, G, J**: Incorrect because they assume mechanical energy is conserved or KE equals GPE, which is not true in the presence of friction.
- **B**: Incorrect because the object does not lose all its energy; it retains some KE at the bottom.
- **D, E, I**: Incorrect because they suggest KE exceeds GPE, which is impossible since friction reduces the energy available for KE.
- **H**: Incorrect because the problem specifies energy loss due to the rough surface, not air resistance.
- **C**: While it mentions KE being less than GPE, it incorrectly states that the work done by friction is greater than the gain in KE, which is not necessarily true.
- **F**: Correct because it accurately explains that KE is less than GPE due to the conversion of GPE into both KE and thermal energy.

Thus, the correct answer is that the object’s kinetic energy at the bottom is less than its initial gravitational potential energy because the GPE is split between KE and thermal energy.
