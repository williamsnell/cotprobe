Okay, let's try to figure out how far the ant travels. So the ant goes from the point (-4,6) to the origin, and then continues to (4,3). I need to find the total distance it crawls. Hmm, I think I should calculate the distance from (-4,6) to (0,0) first, and then from (0,0) to (4,3), and add them together. 

Wait, right, distance between two points in a plane is done using the distance formula. The formula is sqrt[(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2]. So for the first part, from (-4,6) to (0,0):

The x coordinates change from -4 to 0, so that's a change of 4 units (since 0 - (-4)=4). The y coordinates go from 6 to 0, which is a change of -6 units. So the distance should be sqrt(4^2 + (-6)^2). 4 squared is 16, and 6 squared is 36. Adding those gives 52. So the first distance is sqrt(52). Hmm, sqrt(52) can be simplified. 52 is 4*13, so sqrt(4*13) is 2*sqrt(13). Okay, got that part.

Now the second part, from (0,0) to (4,3). Again using the distance formula. The x change is 4-0=4, y change is 3-0=3. So the distance is sqrt(4^2 + 3^2) = sqrt(16 +9) = sqrt(25) which is 5. So that's easy.

Wait, wait a second. So the total distance is the sum of the two parts. So that's 2*sqrt(13) +5. Looking at the options, D is 5 + 2√13, which is the same as what I have. So that must be the correct answer.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. Let me double-check the calculations. For the first part, (-4,6) to (0,0): the differences are 4 and -6. Squares are 16 and 36, sum to 52. Square root of 52 is indeed 2√13 because 52=4*13. And for the second part, (0,0) to (4,3): 4 and 3, squares 16 and 9, sum 25, sqrt is 5. Summing the two distances gives 5 + 2√13, which is option D.

To determine how far the ant travels, we calculate the distance for each leg of its journey and sum them.

1. **First Leg: From $(-4,6)$ to $(0,0)$**  
   Using the distance formula:  
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
   \]  
   Substituting the coordinates:  
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \sqrt{(0 - (-4))^2 + (0 - 6)^2} = \sqrt{4^2 + (-6)^2} = \sqrt{16 + 36} = \sqrt{52}
   \]  
   Simplifying $\sqrt{52}$:  
   \[
   \sqrt{52} = \sqrt{4 \cdot 13} = 2\sqrt{13}
   \]

2. **Second Leg: From $(0,0)$ to $(4,3)$**  
   Using the distance formula:  
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \sqrt{(4 - 0)^2 + (3 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{4^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{16 + 9} = \sqrt{25} = 5
   \]

3. **Total Distance**  
   Adding the two distances:  
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = 2\sqrt{13} + 5
   \]  
   This matches option **D**.
