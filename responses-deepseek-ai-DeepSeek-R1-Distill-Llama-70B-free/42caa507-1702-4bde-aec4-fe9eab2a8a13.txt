Okay, so I've got this economics question here about contractionary monetary policy. Hmm, I need to figure out how it affects the nominal interest rate, aggregate demand, output, and the price level. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I remember that contractionary monetary policy is when the central bank, like the Federal Reserve, tightens the money supply. They usually do this by selling government securities, which reduces the amount of money in circulation. Or maybe they increase the reserve requirements for banks, which also reduces lending.

So, what happens to nominal interest rates when the central bank does this? Well, if they sell securities, they're taking money out of the economy. Less money means that the demand for loans might decrease, but wait, actually, when the Fed sells securities, interest rates tend to rise. Because when they sell, it's like they're competing with other borrowers for funds, which drives up the interest rates. So the nominal interest rate should increase.

Next, how does that affect aggregate demand? Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive. So consumers and businesses are less likely to take out loans. Consumer spending on big-ticket items like cars and houses might decrease because the cost of borrowing is higher. Similarly, businesses might invest less in expansion or new projects. All of this leads to a decrease in aggregate demand.

Now, what about output? Aggregate demand is the total demand for goods and services in the economy. If aggregate demand decreases, businesses won't produce as much because they're not selling as many goods. So output, which is the total production, should decrease as well.

Lastly, the price level. With lower aggregate demand, the overall price level might decrease or at least not rise as much. When people buy less, businesses might reduce prices to encourage sales. So the price level could decrease or stay the same. Wait, but sometimes in the short run, prices are sticky, so maybe the price level doesn't drop immediately. But in the context of monetary policy, a contractionary policy would lead to lower prices over time because less money is chasing goods and services.

Putting it all together: Contractionary monetary policy leads to higher nominal interest rates, which reduce aggregate demand. Lower aggregate demand reduces output and eventually lowers the price level.

Let me look at the options again. The question is asking for the effect on nominal interest rate, aggregate demand, output, and price level, in that order.

Option B: Increase, Decrease, Decrease, Increase. Wait, that would mean the price level increases, but I thought it would decrease. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there.

Wait, no, higher interest rates lead to lower investment and consumption, so aggregate demand shifts left. Lower aggregate demand would mean that the economy moves to a point where both output and price level are lower. So the price level should decrease, not increase.

Looking again, which options have nominal interest rate increase, aggregate demand decrease, output decrease, and price level decrease?

Looking at the options:

Option B says price level increases. So that's not right.

Option H: Increase, Decrease, Decrease, Decrease. That fits what I was thinking. So H is the correct option.

Wait, but I thought initially that contractionary policy might lead to a decrease in price level. So H is the one where all are decreasing except the interest rate, which increases. So yes, that's correct.

A contractionary monetary policy involves the central bank reducing the money supply, often by selling government securities or increasing reserve requirements. This action increases the nominal interest rate because it reduces the amount of money available for borrowing, making loans more expensive. 

Higher nominal interest rates discourage borrowing and spending, leading to a decrease in aggregate demand. With lower aggregate demand, businesses reduce production, resulting in decreased output. Additionally, the lower demand for goods and services can cause the price level to decrease over time, as businesses may reduce prices to stimulate sales.

Analyzing the options, the correct sequence of effects is: nominal interest rate increases, aggregate demand decreases, output decreases, and the price level decreases. This matches option H.

Answer: H
