Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these absolute value operations. Let's take it step by step.

The problem says: Let A = |1 - 12| and B = |283| |323| |151|. Then find A + B and A - B. The options are given from A to J, each with different results. I need to figure out which option is correct.

First, I should compute A and B separately.

Starting with A: A is the absolute value of (1 - 12). So 1 minus 12 is -11, and the absolute value of that is 11. So A = 11.

Now, B is a bit trickier. It's the product of three absolute values: |283|, |323|, and |151|. Wait, no, the question might be using |283| to represent a three-digit number, like 283, but I'm not sure. Oh wait, maybe it's |283| as in the absolute value of 283, but that's just 283 because it's positive. So B is 283 multiplied by 323 multiplied by 151.

But wait, that would make B a huge number. Let me compute that. Let's see:

283 * 323 = let me calculate that. 283 times 300 is 84,900, and 283 times 23 is 6,509. So 84,900 + 6,509 = 91,409. Then 91,409 multiplied by 151. Hmm, that's going to be a big number. Let me see: 91,409 * 100 is 9,140,900. 91,409 * 50 is 4,570,450. 91,409 * 1 is 91,409. Adding them together: 9,140,900 + 4,570,450 equals 13,711,350, plus 91,409 gives 13,802,759. So B is 13,802,759.

Wait, but that seems really big. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again. Oh wait, perhaps the question is written differently. The way it's written is B = |283| |323| |151|. Oh, maybe each of those is a three-digit number. But in that case, each is positive, so the absolute value doesn't change them. So B is 283 * 323 * 151. That's how I calculated it, and it's 13,802,759. But looking at the options, the numbers for A + B and A - B are in the hundreds, not millions. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the notation.

Wait a minute, maybe the question isn't using |283| as the absolute value but representing each digit in some way. Alternatively, perhaps |283| is a three-digit number where each digit is considered separately. Or maybe the numbers are split into individual digits and then processed. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using |abc| as a three-digit number, so |283| is 283, |323| is 323, and |151| is 151. So B is the product 283 * 323 * 151. But as I calculated, that's a very large number, and the options given for A + B and A - B are all in the hundreds. So that can't be right. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the notation.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using |a b c| to denote concatenation or individual digits. Let me think: maybe |283| represents the absolute value of each digit, but that doesn't make sense because 2, 8, and 3 are all positive. Alternatively, maybe it's the sum of the digits. Let me check that. For |283|, the sum would be 2 + 8 + 3 = 13. Similarly, |323| would be 3+2+3=8, and |151| is 1+5+1=7. So B would be 13 * 8 * 7. Let's calculate that: 13*8 is 104, 104*7 is 728. So B would be 728.

Wait, that makes more sense because then A is 11, and adding 728 would give 739 and subtracting would give -717, but I don't see these numbers directly in the options. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, they all have A + B and A - B expressed as two numbers, each in absolute value notation, separated by a comma, I think. Wait, the options each have two parts, like |473| |375| and so on. So perhaps each part is a separate absolute value. So maybe A + B is |473| and |375|, but that would imply that A + B equals 473 and 375. But that doesn't make sense because A + B is a single number. So perhaps the notation is indicating that each digit is taken as an absolute value, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe the problem is miswritten, and instead, A + B is |473| and |375|, but that would mean A + B equals 473 and 375, which can't be right. Alternatively, perhaps the numbers are concatenated. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using |1 - 12| as a four-digit number, but that doesn't make sense because 1-12 is -11, absolute value 11, which is two digits. So I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I should re-examine the problem statement again. Let me read it carefully.

The problem says: Let A = |1 - 12| and B = |283| |323| |151|. Find A + B and A - B.

Hmm. Oh wait, perhaps |283| is a typo and they meant |2 - 8 - 3|, but that would be |2-8-3|=|-9|=9. Similarly, |3| would be 3, but that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe each |abc| represents the absolute value of each digit subtraction, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written in a way that each |abc| is a three-digit number, and then B is the product of those numbers. So 283 * 323 * 151. But as I saw earlier, that's a big number, which doesn't fit the options given. Because in the options, the results are in the hundreds.

Wait, perhaps I'm miscalculating B. Let me double-check. 283 * 323 is 283*(300+23) = 283*300=84,900 and 283*23=6,509. So 84,900 + 6,509 = 91,409. Then 91,409 * 151.

Let me compute 91,409 * 150 first, which is 91,409*100=9,140,900; 91,409*50=4,570,450; adding those gives 13,711,350. Then add 91,409 to get 13,802,759. So B is 13,802,759. Then A is 11, so A + B is 13,802,770 and A - B is -13,802,748, whose absolute values would be 13,802,770 and 13,802,748, respectively. But none of the options are anywhere near that big, so I must have misunderstood the problem.

Wait, maybe the problem is using |283| as a three-digit number and then performing some digit-wise operations. Like, for example, the product is done digit by digit, but that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using |283| to represent the absolute value of each digit, but that would be 2, 8, 3, then each as separate numbers, but it's unclear. Alternatively, maybe it's the sum of each digit, as I thought earlier.

Let me try that approach again. So for each |abc|, compute the sum of its digits.

So |283| would be 2 + 8 + 3 = 13.

|323| would be 3 + 2 + 3 = 8.

|151| would be 1 + 5 + 1 = 7.

So B would be 13 * 8 * 7. Let's compute that: 13 * 8 = 104, 104 *7=728. So B is 728.

Now A is |1-12|=11.

So A + B = 11 + 728 = 739.

A - B = 11 - 728 = -717, and the absolute value would be 717, but in the options, A + B and A - B are given as products of absolute values, perhaps indicating each digit is treated separately.

Wait, looking at the options, each option has two parts: A + B and A - B, each expressed as a product of two absolute values. For example, option A says A + B = |473| |375| and A - B = |-1 -9 -1| |3 -23|.

Wait, perhaps each of these is a two-step process, where each digit of the result is taken as absolute values. So, for A + B = 739, it's written as |7| |3| |9|, but none of the options have three absolute values. Alternatively, maybe it's |73| |9|, but the options have two absolute values per result.

Hmm, perhaps for each result, the number is split into two parts, each as an absolute value. So 739 would be split into 7 and 39, making |7| |39|, but 7 is 7 and 39 is 39. Alternatively, split into 73 and 9, making |73| |9|.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option H: A + B = |375| |474|, A - B = |-1 -9 -1| |2 -32|.

Wait, no, let me look at each option.

Option A: A + B = |473| |375|. So 473 and 375, which are both positive, so their absolute values are themselves. So A + B would be 473 * 375? That can't be right because 473*375 is way larger than 739.

Wait, perhaps the plus and minus operations are applied to the individual digits. So maybe A + B is computed digit-wise, but that seems unlikely.

Alternatively, perhaps each |abc| represents a three-digit number, and then the operations are done on those numbers. For example, A + B is |473| and |375|, which are 473 and 375, but that doesn't make sense because A + B is a single number, 739.

Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Let me try a different approach. Maybe the problem is using a different notation, perhaps |a b c| represents a three-digit number where each digit is the result of some operation.

Wait, going back to the initial calculations: if B is 728 and A is 11, then A + B = 739 and A - B = -717.

Looking at the options, each gives A + B and A - B as products of two absolute values. So perhaps each result is split into two numbers, and each part is taken as absolute value.

For 739, possible splits are 7 and 39, 73 and 9. Let's compute both:

|7| |39| = 7*39=273, which doesn't match 739.

|73| |9|=73*9=657, no.

Alternatively, maybe it's |7| + |39| = 7 + 39=46, which also doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the notation is that the absolute value is applied to each digit. For 739, each digit is 7, 3, 9. So |7| |3| |9|, but the options have two absolute values per operation.

Alternatively, maybe it's |7| |39|, but I'm not seeing how that would work.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is miswritten, and the options are showing the individual digits of A+B and A-B as absolute values.

Wait, looking at option H: A + B = |375| |474|. So 375 and 474. But 375 + 474 = 849, which doesn't match 739.

Wait, perhaps the options are indicating that A+B is 375 and 474, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, maybe each |abc| represents a three-digit number, and the operations are done digit-wise. For example, |1 - 12| is 11, which is two digits, but perhaps it's treated as 0 1 1 or something. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the sum and difference of the numbers as vectors or something else, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I should consider that A and B are being treated as multi-digit numbers, and A + B and A - B are the results of adding and subtracting each digit. But that seems complicated.

Wait, let's compute A + B and A - B as 739 and -717.

So A + B is 739, which can be split into 7, 3, 9. A - B is 717 (absolute value of -717). So 717 is 7,1,7.

Looking at the options, let's see:

Option H: A + B = |375| |474|, which would be 375 and 474. That doesn't match 739.

Option E: A + B = |375| |474|, which again doesn't fit.

Option C: A + B = |473| |475|. 473 + 475 would be 948, which doesn't match.

Wait, perhaps it's a misprint and the options are using | to separate the digits of the number. For example, |473| |375| would represent 473 and 375 as separate numbers, but that doesn't add up to 739.

Alternatively, perhaps the operations are done on each digit individually. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps I should compute A and B as vectors of digits and perform component-wise addition and subtraction. For example, if A is 11 (digits 1 and 1) and B is 728 (digits 7, 2, 8), but that would require padding with zeros. So A could be 0 1 1 and B as 7 2 8.

Then A + B would be 7+0=7, 2+1=3, 8+1=9 → 739. Similarly, A - B would be 0-7=-7, 1-2=-1, 1-8=-7. Taking absolute values of each digit gives 7,1,7 → 717.

So in this approach, A + B is 739, and |A - B| is 717.

Now, looking at the options, how are these represented?

Option H says A + B is |375| |474|, which is 375 and 474. But 375 + 474 is 849, not 739. So that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps each |abc| represents the digits of the number. So 739 would be written as |7| |3| |9|, but the options have two absolute values per operation.

Looking again, option C says A + B = |473| |475|. That would be 473 and 475. But 473 + 475 is 948, which isn't 739.

Wait, perhaps instead of adding the numbers, they are concatenated. So |473| |475| would be 473475, which is way bigger than 739.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is using |abc| to denote the concatenation of digits after operations. So for A + B = 739, it's written as |7| |39| or |73| |9|, but the options don't present it that way.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is using |a b c| as individual digits, each taken as absolute values. So 739 would be |7| |3| |9|, but the options only have two absolute values per operation.

Wait, maybe the problem is considering the sum and difference as two separate three-digit numbers, but that doesn't fit with the way A and B are calculated.

Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in calculating B. Let me try another approach: perhaps B is the product of |283|, |323|, and |151|, but each |abc| is treated as the absolute value of the number, which they are, so 283 * 323 * 151, which is 13,802,759. Then A is 11, so A + B is 13,802,770, and A - B is -13,802,748, whose absolute value is 13,802,748. But none of the options are anywhere near this magnitude, so I must have misunderstood the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses |283| as the absolute value of each digit, so |2| |8| |3|. But that would be 2,8,3. Then B would be 2 * 8 * 3 = 48. Similarly, |323| would be |3| |2| |3| = 3*2*3=18, and |151|=1*5*1=5. Then B would be 48 * 18 *5. Let's compute that: 48 *18 is 864, 864*5=4320. So B would be 4320.

Then A is 11. So A + B = 4331, A - B = -4309, whose absolute value is 4309.

Looking at the options, none of them have 4331 or 4309. So that can't be right either.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to find a different approach.

Wait, looking at the options, each option for A + B and A - B is expressed as two absolute values, each being a three-digit number. So perhaps the correct approach is to compute A and B as numbers, then split their sum and difference into two three-digit numbers each, and see which option matches.

Given that A is 11 and B is 728, then A + B is 739 and |A - B| is 717.

Now, 739 can be split into 7 and 39, but that's two digits and two digits, but the options have three-digit numbers each. Alternatively, pad with a zero: 0 and 739, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering each digit of A and B and performing component-wise operations.

Wait, A is 11, which can be written as 0 1 1 (three digits), and B is 728 as 7 2 8.

Then A + B would be (0+7) (1+2) (1+8) = 7 3 9,
