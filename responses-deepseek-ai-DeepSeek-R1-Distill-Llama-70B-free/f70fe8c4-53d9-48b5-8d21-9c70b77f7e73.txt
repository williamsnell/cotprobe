Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the de Broglie wavelength of an electron. Hmm, I remember that the de Broglie wavelength is related to the momentum of a particle. The formula, I think, is lambda equals h over p, where h is Planck's constant and p is momentum. Oh wait, right, momentum p is mass times velocity. So lambda = h/(m*v).

The question says the electron is moving at 1/137th the speed of light. Oh, wait, the speed of light is approximately 3 x 10^8 meters per second. So the electron's speed v would be c divided by 137. Let me compute that. c is about 3e8 m/s, so v is (3e8) / 137. Let me calculate that value. 3e8 divided by 137... 3e8 is 300,000,000. Divided by 137. Let me see, 137 times 2 is 274, so 3e8 /137 is approximately 2.19e6 m/s. Wait, wait, wait, maybe I should be precise. Let me actually compute that, but maybe I can keep it as c/137 for now.

Wait, no, perhaps I can plug in the numbers. So Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s. The mass of an electron m is about 9.109 x 10^-31 kg. And the speed of light c is 3 x 10^8 m/s. So v is c/137 = (3e8) / 137 ≈ 2.1906e6 m/s. Wait, let me calculate 3e8 divided by 137. 3e8 is 300,000,000. 137 times 2,000,000 is 274,000,000. So 300,000,000 minus 274,000,000 is 26,000,000. So 2,000,000 m/s is about 2e6, and then 26e6 left. So 26e6 divided by 137 is approximately 190,000. So v is about 2,190,000 m/s.

Now, putting it into the formula. Lambda = h/(m*v) = (6.626e-34) / (9.109e-31 kg * 2.19e6 m/s). Let me compute the denominator first. Mass times velocity is 9.109e-31 * 2.19e6. Let's compute 9.109e-31 * 2e6 is 1.8218e-24. 9.109e-31 * 0.19e6 is approximately 1.73071e-24. Wait, maybe it's better to compute 9.109e-31 * 2.19e6 = 9.109 * 2.19 = let's compute that. 9 * 2.19 is 19.71, 0.109 * 2.19 is about 0.238. So total is 19.71 + 0.238 = ~19.948. So 19.948e-25 kg·m/s because 1e-31 * 1e6 is 1e-25. So denominator is 1.9948e-24, approximately.

Wait, wait, let me recalculate that. 9.109e-31 kg times 2.19e6 m/s. 9.109 * 2.19 is (9 * 2.19) + (0.109 *2.19) = 19.71 + 0.238 ≈ 19.948. Then the exponents: 10^-31 * 10^6 = 10^(-25). So denominator is 19.948e-25 kg·m/s, which is 1.9948e-24 kg·m/s.

So lambda is 6.626e-34 divided by 1.9948e-24. Let me compute that. 6.626e-34 / 1.9948e-24 = (6.626 / 1.9948) * 10^(-34 +24) ) = (approx 3.324) * 1e-10 meters. So that's 3.324e-10 meters. Wait, 1e-10 meters is 0.1 nanometers, right? Because 1 nm is 1e-9 m. So 3.324e-10 m is 0.3324 nm.

Looking at the options, option J is 0.332 nm. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check the calculations because I might have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, another approach: Alternatively, I remember that when an electron's speed is v, the de Broglie wavelength is h/(m_e * v). And I can calculate it step by step more carefully.

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s (exactly, but approximate is ok)
m_e = 9.10938356e-31 kg
c = 2.99792458e8 m/s
v = c /137 = 2.99792458e8 /137 ≈ 2.1898e6 m/s.

Compute m_e * v:
9.10938356e-31 kg * 2.1898e6 m/s = let me compute this.

Multiply 9.10938356 by 2.1898. Let me compute 9 * 2.1898 is 19.7082, 0.10938356 *2.1898 ≈ 0.10938 *2 is 0.21876, 0.10938 *0.1898≈0.0208. So total is ≈ 0.21876 +0.0208 = 0.23956. So total is 19.7082 +0.23956 ≈19.94776. So 19.94776e-25 kg·m/s because 1e-31 *1e6=1e-25. So 1.994776e-24 kg·m/s.

Now, lambda = h / (m_e v) = 6.62607015e-34 / 1.994776e-24 = let's compute 6.62607015 /1.994776 = let's approximate. 6.626 / 2 is about 3.313, but since denominator is 1.994776 ≈ 2.0, but let's compute more accurately.

1.994776 is approximately 1.9948. 6.62607 / 1.9948. Let me compute 1.9948 *3 =5.9844. 6.62607 -5.9844 = 0.64167. So 0.64167 /1.9948 ≈0.3216. So total is 3 + 0.3216 ≈3.3216. So 3.3216e-10 m. Which is 0.33216 nm, approximately 0.332 nm. So option J is 0.332 nm.

Wait, let me check if I made any calculation errors. Another approach: I can recall that the speed of light is about 3e8 m/s, so c/137 is about 2.19e6 m/s. Then, m_e is about 9.1e-31 kg, so m*v is 9.1e-31 *2.19e6 = 9.1 *2.19 = approx 19.929e-25 kg·m/s. Then h/(m*v) is 6.626e-34 /19.929e-25 = 6.626 /19.929 * 1e-9 meters.

6.626 /19.929 is approximately 0.332. So 0.332e-9 meters is 0.332 nm. So yes, that's option J.

Wait, but let me think again because sometimes I might confuse e-10 and e-9. Oh, wait, 1e-9 meters is 1 nm. So 0.332e-9 m is 0.332 nm. So yes, J is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a different formula. I remember that the de Broglie wavelength can also be calculated using lambda = h/(m_e c) * c/v. Wait, but that's the same as h/(m_e v), which is what I did earlier.

Alternatively, I can compute it using the known value for h/(m_e c), which is a constant. h/(m_e c) is approximately 2.426 ×10^-12 meters, or 2.426 picometers. Hmm, wait, that doesn't immediately help, but perhaps I can think in terms of that.

Wait, if lambda = h/(m_e v) = (h/(m_e c)) * (c/v). So h/(m_e c) is 2.426e-12 m, and c/v is 137 because v is c/137. So lambda = 2.426e-12 m * 137. Let me compute that. 2.426 *137 = let's see. 2 *137 = 274, 0.426 *137 = approx 58.322. So total is 274 +58.322 = 332.322. So 332.322e-12 meters. Which is 0.332322e-9 meters, or 0.332 nm. Yep, same result as before. So option J, 0.332 nm is correct.

To calculate the de Broglie wavelength of an electron moving at 1/137th the speed of light, we use the formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{h}{m_e v}
\]

where:
- \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \mathrm{J \cdot s} \) (Planck's constant),
- \( m_e = 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, \mathrm{kg} \) (mass of the electron),
- \( v = \frac{c}{137} \), with \( c = 3 \times 10^8 \, \mathrm{m/s} \) (speed of light).

### Step 1: Calculate the velocity \( v \)
\[
v = \frac{c}{137} = \frac{3 \times 10^8}{137} \approx 2.19 \times 10^6 \, \mathrm{m/s}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the momentum \( p = m_e v \)
\[
p = m_e v = (9.109 \times 10^{-31}) \times (2.19 \times 10^6) \approx 1.9948 \times 10^{-24} \, \mathrm{kg \cdot m/s}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the de Broglie wavelength \( \lambda \)
\[
\lambda = \frac{h}{p} = \frac{6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{1.9948 \times 10^{-24}} \approx 3.3216 \times 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m}.
\]

Convert to nanometers (\( 1 \, \mathrm{nm} = 10^{-9} \, \mathrm{m} \)):
\[
\lambda \approx 0.332 \, \mathrm{nm}.
\]

### Final Answer
The de Broglie wavelength of the electron is approximately **0.332 nm**, which corresponds to option **J**.
