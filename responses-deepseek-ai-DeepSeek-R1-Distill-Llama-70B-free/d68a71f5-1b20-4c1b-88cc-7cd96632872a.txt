D: 1.64%
E: 183%
F: 2.45%

Okay, so I've got this problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I want to make sure I get it right. Let's take it step by step.

Alright, the question is about calculating the yearly yield on an investment. The scenario is buying a limousine for $98,000 and renting it out. I need to find the percentage return each year. The options are given from A to J, and I have to pick the correct one.

Let me read the problem again to make sure I get all the details.

So, the limo costs $98,000. The rental rate is $245 per hour. They estimate it's hired for 2 hours a day on average. Daily costs are about $50. The question is asking for the estimated yearly yield on the investment if they work every day of the year, including weekends and holidays. So that's 365 days a year.

Hmm. Yield on investment, I think that refers to the return on investment, like ROI. So, ROI is usually calculated as (net profit)/(initial investment) * 100 to get a percentage.

So I need to calculate the total revenue from renting the limo minus the total costs, then divide that by the initial investment to find the ROI.

Let's break it down.

First, calculate the daily revenue. They rent it for 2 hours a day at $245 per hour. So 2 hours * $245 = $490 per day. That's the revenue per day.

Then, the daily cost is $50. So the net profit per day would be revenue minus cost. So $490 - $50 = $440 per day.

Wait, wait a second. Is that right? Because $245 per hour times 2 hours is $490 revenue. Then subtract $50 in daily costs. Yeah, that makes $440 profit each day.

Now, since this is every day of the year, that's 365 days. So total yearly profit is 365 * $440.

Let me do that math. 365 times 440. Hmm, 365 * 400 is 146,000, and 365 * 40 is 14,600. So adding them together, 146,000 + 14,600 = 160,600. So $160,600 per year profit.

Wait, but wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately. Let me compute 365 * 440.

Alternatively, 440 is 400 + 40. So 365 * 400 is 365*4*100. 365*4 is 1,460, so times 100 is 146,000. 365 * 40 is 14,600. So adding 146,000 +14,600 gives 160,600. Yeah, that's correct.

Now, the initial investment is $98,000. So the ROI is (profit/investment)*100.

So profit is $160,600, investment is $98,000. So 160,600 /98,000 = approximately what?

Let me compute that. 98,000 * 1.638... so let's see.

98,000 * 1.64 = ?

Wait, let's compute 160,600 รท 98,000.

Divide numerator and denominator by 100: 1606 / 980.

Let me do this division.

980 goes into 1606 how many times?

980 * 1 = 980. Subtract from 1606: 626. Bring down a zero (since we can consider 1606.00). 6260 divided by 980.

980 *6 = 5880. Subtract 6260-5880=380. Bring down next zero: 3800.

980 goes into 3800 3 times (980 *3=2940). Subtract: 3800-2940=860. Bring down zero: 8600.

980 *8=7840. Subtract: 8600-7840=760. Bring down zero: 7600.

980 *7=6860. Subtract:7600-6860=740. Hmm, this is getting a bit tedious, but I think I can approximate.

So 1606 รท 980 is approximately 1.64.

So 1.64 times 100 is 164%. So the ROI is 164%, which would be option H. Wait, let me check the options:

Options:

A: 150%
B: 0.45%
C: 0.164%
D: 1.64%
E: 183%
F: 2.45%
G: 245%
H: 164%
I: 75%
J: 200%

Yes, H is 164%, which matches our calculation.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check whether I considered all the costs correctly.

The daily cost is $50. So that's a fixed cost per day, regardless of how many hours it's rented. So even if it's only rented for 2 hours, the daily cost is $50. So yes, the net per day is $440.

Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to approach it.

Total revenue per year: 365 days * 2 hours/day * $245/hour.

That's 365 * 2 = 730 hours. 730 *245.

Let me compute that:

245 *700 = 245*7*100=1715*100=171,500.

245 *30=7,350.

So 171,500 +7,350=178,850.

Then, total cost per year is 365 *50 = 18,250.

So net profit is 178,850 -18,250=160,600.

Same as before. So ROI is 160,600 /98,000 = ~1.638, which is approximately 164%.

So the answer should be H.

To calculate the estimated yearly yield on the investment, we first determine the daily profit. The limousine is rented for 2 hours a day at $245 per hour, generating $490 in daily revenue. Subtracting the daily cost of $50, the net profit per day is:

\[
\$490 - \$50 = \$440 \text{ per day.}
\]

Since the limousine is rented every day of the year (365 days), the total yearly profit is:

\[
365 \times \$440 = \$160,600.
\]

The initial investment is $98,000. The yearly yield on the investment (ROI) is calculated as:

\[
\text{ROI} = \left( \frac{\text{Profit}}{\text{Investment}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{\$160,600}{\$98,000} \right) \times 100 \approx 164\%.
\]

Thus, the estimated yearly yield on the investment is approximately **164%**, which corresponds to option **H**.
