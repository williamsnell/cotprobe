Question:

The board of a state university has adopted the following rule concerning residency requirements:"A student will be considered a legal resident of the state for the purpose of registering at the university if such person is over the age of 21 and has established a legal residence in the state for at least one year next preceding the last day of registration for credit. "A student moved to the state and immediately enrolled at the state university. Since he did not fulfill the university residency requirement, the student was required to pay $1,800 tuition each semester, which was $400 more than the tuition of state resident-students. In an action by the student challenging the constitutionality of the provision governing the determination of residency for the purpose of fixing a fee differential for out-of-state students in public college, the court will most likely declare the provision

Options:

A: unconstitutional, because it constitutes a violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
B: constitutional, because the fee differential promotes a compelling state interest.
C: unconstitutional, because it constitutes a violation of the privileges and immunities clause of Article IV, Section 2.
D: constitutional, because it is within the university's rights to set tuition fees.
E: constitutional, because the provision does not trigger strict scrutiny.
F: unconstitutional, because it constitutes a violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
G: unconstitutional, because it discriminates against out-of-state students.
H: unconstitutional, because it infringes upon the student's right to education.
I: constitutional, because it serves a legitimate state interest in encouraging state residency.

Okay, so I have this question about a state university's residency requirement and whether it's constitutional. Hmm, let me think. The rule says a student must be over 21 and have lived in the state for at least a year before the last day of registration to be considered a resident. A student moved here and enrolled but didn't meet this requirement, so he had to pay higher tuition—$1,800 instead of $1,400. Now he's challenging this provision in court.

I remember that states can charge different tuition for residents and non-residents. But wait, isn't there some constitutional issue here? Maybe something about equal protection or another clause. 

The Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause comes to mind. It says states can't deny equal protection under the law. But for things like residency requirements, I think the analysis might involve the Privileges and Immunities Clause in Article IV. Oh right, because that clause is about treating citizens from other states equally regarding fundamental rights, like accessing courts or earning a livelihood. Education might be considered such a right.

In a case I recall, the Supreme Court has dealt with this. I think it was the case where a state's residency requirement for in-state tuition was challenged. The Court said that charging higher tuition to non-residents might violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause because it affects the ability of non-residents to attend the university, which is a fundamental right—like education or maybe the right to travel.

Wait, so in that case, the Court held that the differential in tuition was a penalty on the right to travel, which is protected. Alternatively, it could be about whether the state's reason for the fee is substantial and whether the means are closely related to that reason. But I'm getting a bit mixed up between the different constitutional clauses here.

The question is about whether the provision is constitutional. So if the provision is based on residency, which affects out-of-state students, which the Privileges and Immunities Clause might cover. Also, the right to education is a fundamental interest, but I'm not sure if that's under Equal Protection or another clause.

Wait, the Privileges and Immunities Clause in Article IV, Section 2 says that states can't discriminate against citizens of other states regarding fundamental rights. So if the tuition difference impacts the ability to attend, which is a fundamental right, then the state has to have a substantial reason for the discrimination.

In the case Toober v. North Carolina, or maybe it was another case, the Supreme Court found that higher tuition for non-residents was unconstitutional under the Privileges and Immunities Clause. Because higher education is a fundamental right, and the state didn't have a substantial enough reason for the differential. The state's interest in making residents pay lower fees because they contribute through taxes might not justify the discrimination, especially if non-residents also pay taxes in other ways.

So the university's rule here is based on a one-year residency requirement. The student moved in and immediately enrolled, so he wouldn't qualify. The tuition is higher, which the student argues is unconstitutional.

Looking at the options:

Option C says it's unconstitutional under the Privileges and Immunities Clause. Option A is about Equal Protection. Which one applies here?

I think the Privileges and Immunities Clause is more specific to discrimination against out-of-state citizens. Equal Protection might require a higher standard, like strict scrutiny, but perhaps the analysis under the P&I clause is more appropriate here.

So the court would likely find the provision unconstitutional under the Privileges and Immunities Clause because it discriminates against out-of-state students regarding a fundamental right—higher education. The state's reasoning about residency and tuition might not hold up because the differential could be seen as a penalty on the right to travel or choose residency.

Another angle: the right to travel is protected under the Constitution, and imposing higher tuition could be a burden on that right. So maybe the court would apply strict scrutiny. But if the state's interest isn't compelling enough or the means aren't narrowly tailored, then it's unconstitutional.

Alternatively, the state might argue that the fee differential encourages people to become residents, which serves a legitimate interest. But I'm not sure if that's a strong enough reason under the P&I clause.

So putting it all together: the correct answer is probably option C, unconstitutional under the Privileges and Immunities Clause.

The question concerns the constitutionality of a state university's residency requirement for determining tuition rates. The rule mandates that a student must be over 21 and have established residency for at least one year to qualify for in-state tuition. A student who moved to the state and enrolled immediately was required to pay higher tuition, challenging the provision as unconstitutional.

The analysis focuses on two constitutional clauses: the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV, Section 2. The Privileges and Immunities Clause is particularly relevant because it prohibits states from discriminating against citizens of other states regarding fundamental rights, such as access to higher education. The Supreme Court has held that charging significantly higher tuition to non-residents can violate this clause, as it imposes a penalty on the right to travel and access educational opportunities.

The university's residency requirement creates a fee differential that discriminates against out-of-state students, impacting their ability to attend the university. While the state may argue that the differential encourages residency, this interest is unlikely to justify the discrimination under the Privileges and Immunities Clause. The Court would likely find the provision unconstitutional because it discriminates against out-of-state students regarding a fundamental right.
