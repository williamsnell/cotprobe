Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about ethics, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is: "Under ethical ________ objective moral principles can be rationally determined, while ethical under ________ morality is both context-dependent and subjective."

The options are A through J, each with two terms filled in the blanks.

Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my ethical theories, but I remember a few key concepts. Let me think about each blank one by one.

The first blank is about a type of ethical theory where objective moral principles can be determined rationally. Objective means that the principles are universal and not dependent on personal opinions. So which ethical theories support that idea?

I think of Ethical Absolutism and Ethical Objectivism. Wait, but the question uses terms like Absolutism and Relativism. So maybe the first blank is Absolutism. Because in Absolutism, there are absolute moral rules, like Kant's categorical imperative, which can be determined through reason.

Alternatively, another thought: Normative ethics deals with norms, but I'm not sure if it's about being objective. Normative theories like Utilitarianism or Deontology provide frameworks, but their principles might be considered objective, but the term normativity itself might not fit as well.

Wait, the first part says "under ethical ________ objective moral principles can be rationally determined." So it's about a school of thought where you can rationally determine these objective principles. So that's probably Absolutism because it posits that certain actions are always right or wrong, regardless of context, and these can be known through reason.

So the first blank is likely "Absolutism."

Now, the second part: "while ethical under ________ morality is both context-dependent and subjective." Context-dependent suggests that what's right or wrong depends on the situation, not absolute rules. Subjective means it's based on personal feelings or perspectives.

So which theory fits that? Ethical Relativism! Because relativism holds that moral judgments are relative to the cultural, historical, or personal context. So under relativism, morality depends on the situation and varies between individuals, making it subjective.

Wait, but another possibility is Subjectivism. Ethical Subjectivism is the view that moral statements are about the attitudes or feelings of the subject. So, yes, that would make morality subjective. But does it make it context-dependent? I think so because each individual's context (their feelings, beliefs) determines their morality.

Wait, but the question says "both context-dependent and subjective." So which term fits better?

Let me think about the options. The options for the second blank in the choices are things like Absolutism, Normativity, Relativism, Subjectivism.

Looking at the options, let's consider each possible pair.

Option D says Absolutism, Relativism. So first blank Absolutism, second Relativism.

Wait, in that case, the second part would be under Relativism, which is context-dependent and subjective. That makes sense because relativism is about varying based on context.

Alternatively, if the second term was Subjectivism, then it's about individual subjective feelings. So both context and subjectivity may apply, but perhaps Relativism is more about the context aspect.

So putting it together, the first blank is Absolutism, the second is Relativism.

Now looking at the options:

Option D is Absolutism, Relativism.

Wait, let me check all the options:

Option A: Relativism, Absolutism → No, first blank should be Absolutism.

Option B: Absolutism, Normativity → I don't think Normativity is the right fit for the second part.

Option C: Subjectivism, Relativism → First part wrong.

Option D: Absolutism, Relativism → Yes, matches.

Option E: Normativity, Absolutism → No.

Option F: Normativity, Relativism → First blank wrong.

Option G: Relativism, Normativity → First blank wrong.

Option H: Relativism, Relativism → No.

Option I: Absolutism, Absolutism → Second part wrong.

Option J: Absolutism, Subjectivism → Second could be subjectivism, but I think relativism is better.

So the correct answer should be option D.

The question asks about two ethical theories: one where objective moral principles can be rationally determined and another where morality is context-dependent and subjective. 

1. **First Blank**: The theory where objective moral principles can be rationally determined is **Absolutism**. Ethical Absolutism posits that certain actions are always right or wrong, regardless of context, and these principles can be known through reason (e.g., Kant's categorical imperative).

2. **Second Blank**: The theory where morality is context-dependent and subjective is **Relativism**. Ethical Relativism holds that moral judgments are relative to cultural, historical, or personal contexts, making morality vary between individuals and situations.

Analyzing the options, **Option D (Absolutism, Relativism)** correctly fills the blanks, as it aligns with the description of objective moral principles under Absolutism and context-dependent, subjective morality under Relativism.

Answer: D
