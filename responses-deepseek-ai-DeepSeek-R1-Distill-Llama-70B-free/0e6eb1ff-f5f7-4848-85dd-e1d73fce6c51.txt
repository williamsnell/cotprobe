Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

Alright, the problem is about an automobile whose mass is given as 50 slugs. It's moving at 30 ft/sec, and the driver applies the brakes. The velocity decreases over time according to the equation v = v₀ - kt², where v₀ is 30 ft/sec, and k is 0.30 ft/sec³. The question asks for the resultant force decelerating the car 5 seconds after the brakes are applied. The options are from A to J, some negative numbers in pounds.

Hmm, so I remember that force is related to acceleration through Newton's second law, F = ma. But wait, since the car is decelerating, the acceleration will be negative. Also, I think I need to find the acceleration at time t=5 seconds first, and then multiply by mass to get force.

Let me break it down. The velocity equation is given as v(t) = v₀ - kt². To find acceleration, I need the derivative of velocity with respect to time because acceleration a is dv/dt.

So taking the derivative of v(t) with respect to t: dv/dt = 0 - 2kt. So a(t) = -2kt. Wait, because the derivative of t squared is 2t, multiplied by k, so it's -2kt.

Wait, at t=5 seconds, what's the acceleration? Let me plug in the numbers. k is 0.30 ft/sec³, so a(5) = -2 * 0.30 *5. Let's calculate that. 2 * 0.3 is 0.6, multiplied by 5 gives 3. So a = -3 ft/sec². Oh wait, no, wait. 2*0.3 is 0.6, 0.6 *5 is 3. So a(5) = -3 ft/s².

Wait, but wait a second. The velocity equation is v = v0 - kt². So the derivative is a = -2kt. So at t=5, a = -2 * 0.3 *5. Let me compute that again. 2 * 0.3 is 0.6, 0.6 *5 is 3. So a is -3 ft/s². Yes, that's correct.

But I'm a bit confused because the problem states that the velocity decreases to zero. So do I have to check if at t=5, the velocity is zero or not? Wait, no. Because the question is asking for the force at t=5, regardless of whether the car has stopped or not. But wait, let's check if the car would have stopped before 5 seconds.

Let me think. The velocity equation is v(t) = 30 - 0.3 t². So when does v(t) become zero? Setting 0 =30 -0.3 t². Solving for t, 0.3 t² =30 → t²=100 → t=10 seconds. So at t=5, the velocity is still positive, because 0.3*(5)^2 = 0.3*25=7.5. So v=30-7.5=22.5 ft/s. So it's still moving forward, so the acceleration is still negative, which makes sense.

So acceleration at t=5 is -3 ft/s². Now, the mass is given as 50 slugs. Force is mass times acceleration, so F = m*a. But wait, since the acceleration is negative, the force will be negative too. So F =50 slug * (-3 ft/s²) = -150 slug*ft/s².

Wait, but wait. Slug is the unit of mass, and the unit for force in the imperial system is pounds. So 1 slug is approximately 32.174 lb·s²/ft. Hmm, but wait, because when you have F=ma in slug and ft/s², the result is in pounds because 1 slug * 1 ft/s² = 1 lb. Wait, is that right? Let me think again. Because the definition is that 1 slug is the mass that accelerates at 1 ft/s² when a force of 1 lb is applied. So yes, F (lb) = m (slug) * a (ft/s²). So in this case, F = 50 slugs * (-3 ft/s²) = -150 lb. So the resultant force is -150 lb.

Looking at the options, option E is -150 lb. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check my calculation. a(t) = -2kt, so a(5) = -2 * 0.3 *5. 2*0.3 is 0.6. 0.6 *5 is 3. So a is -3. Yes, correct. Then F =50 * (-3) = -150 lb. So yes, E is correct.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. But wait, let me make sure about the units again. In the imperial system, F (lb) = m (slug) * a (ft/s²). So 50 slugs * 3 ft/s² gives 150 lb, with a negative sign because it's deceleration. So yeah, E is the right answer.

To solve the problem, we start with the given velocity equation:

\[
v(t) = v_0 - kt^2
\]

where \(v_0 = 30 \, \text{ft/sec}\), \(k = 0.30 \, \text{ft/sec}^3\), and \(t\) is the time in seconds. To find the resultant force decelerating the automobile, we first need to determine the acceleration at \(t = 5 \, \text{seconds}\). Acceleration is the derivative of velocity with respect to time:

\[
a(t) = \frac{dv}{dt} = -2kt
\]

Substituting \(k = 0.30 \, \text{ft/sec}^3\) and \(t = 5 \, \text{seconds}\):

\[
a(5) = -2(0.30)(5) = -3 \, \text{ft/sec}^2
\]

The mass of the automobile is given as \(m = 50 \, \text{slugs}\). Using Newton's second law, \(F = ma\), the resultant force is:

\[
F = m \cdot a = 50 \cdot (-3) = -150 \, \text{lb}
\]

The negative sign indicates that the force is acting in the opposite direction of motion (deceleration). Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**E: -150 lb**
