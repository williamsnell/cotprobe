Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics problem. Let me read it again. The question is about red-green color blindness, which is a recessive sex-linked trait. So, color blindness is on the X chromosome, right? And since it's recessive, you need both copies to show the trait, but for males, who have only one X, one copy is enough.

The scenario is a man who is color-blind marrying a woman with normal vision, but her father was color-blind. I need to find out the expected phenotypic results in their children.

Hmm, let me break it down. The man is color-blind, so his genotype must be XbY, because he has the color-blind allele on his X (since it's sex-linked). Wait, no, wait. For color blindness, which is recessive, let's say the gene is on the X. So females have two X's, and males have one X and one Y.

The man is color-blind, so his X must carry the recessive allele. So his genotype is XbY. Because for a male, one copy of the recessive allele is enough to express the trait.

Now, the woman has normal vision, so her genotype must be either XX (homozygous dominant) or XBXb (heterozygous carrier, since she's not affected but might carry the allele). But wait, her father was color-blind, which means he must have had XbY. So if her father was XbY, and her mother must have contributed an X as well.

Wait, the woman's father was color-blind (XbY), and her mother... we don't know. But the woman's genotype can be determined based on her father. Let's think. The woman gets her X from her father and another X from her mother. Since her father was color-blind, his X would carry the recessive allele (Xb). So the woman's X from her father is Xb. Her other X comes from her mother, who must have normal vision. But the mother's genotype isn't given, but the question says the woman has normal vision, so she must have at least one dominant allele.

Wait, the woman's mother's genotype must be either XBXB or XBXb. But since the woman has normal vision, she could be XBXb or XBXB. But because the woman's father is XbY, the woman gets Xb from him. So her genotype is Xb (from dad) and X? from mom. Since she has normal vision, her other X must have the dominant allele, XB. So the woman's genotype is XBXb.

Wait, is that right? Because if the mother is XBXB, then the daughter would get XBXb (since the father gives Xb). If the mother is XBXb, the daughter could get XB (from mom) or Xb (from dad). Wait, no, no, the daughter gets Xb from dad, and from mom, either XB or Xb. Wait, the mother's genotype isn't given. Hmm, but the question says the woman has normal vision, so her genotype is either XBXB or XBXb.

But the woman's father is color-blind (XbY), so she must have received Xb from him. Therefore, her genotype is Xb from dad and X? from mom. Since she has normal vision, mom must have given her a normal allele, XB. So the woman is XBXb. Because if she were XBXB, she wouldn't be a carrier, but since her father was XbY, she must have received Xb from him, making her XBXb if her mom gave XB.

Wait, another way: the woman's father is XbY. So all his daughters get his Xb. The mother must have given the other X, which can't be Xb, because the daughter has normal vision. So the mother's X must be XB. So the daughter is XBXb, a carrier but not affected.

So woman is XBXb, man is XbY.

Now, let's map out the possible gametes.

The man can only give his Xb or his Y. Wait, no. The man produces sperm with either Xb or Y. So his gametes are Xb (50%) and Y (50%).

The woman, who is XBXb, will produce gametes with either XB or Xb. So 50% XB and 50% Xb.

Now, let's look at the children.

For sons (who get Y from dad and X from mom):

If mom gives XB → son is XBY → normal vision.

If mom gives Xb → son is XbY → color blind.

So 50% chance of each. So half the sons will have normal vision, half color blind.

For daughters (get X from dad and X from mom):

Dad gives Xb (since his X is Xb). Mom gives either XB or Xb.

So daughters can be Xb (from dad) and XB (from mom) → XBXb → carrier, normal vision.

Or Xb (dad) and Xb (mom) → XbXb → color blind.

So 50% XBXb (normal) and 50% XbXb (color blind).

Wait, but wait. No, wait. Wait, the father's X is Xb, so all daughters get Xb from him. The mother contributes either XB or Xb. So daughters are either XBXb (carrier, normal) or XbXb (color blind).

So for each daughter, 50% chance of normal (carrier) and 50% color blind.

So putting it all together:

Sons: 50% normal, 50% color blind.

Daughters: 50% normal (but carrier), 50% color blind.

Wait, but the question asks about the expected phenotypic results. So:

Each child has:

- 50% chance of being a son.

Sons: 50% color blind, 50% normal.

So overall, for sons, 25% of all children (50% chance son, 50% affected).

Similarly, 50% daughters.

Daughters: 50% color blind, 50% normal.

So overall, for daughters, 25% color blind, 25% normal.

Wait, let me think in terms of all possible children.

Each child has a 50% chance to be male, 50% female.

Males:

- 50% chance of normal vision.

- 50% chance of color blind.

Females:

- 50% chance of color blind.

- 50% chance of normal vision (but carriers).

So for each child, regardless of gender, 50% chance of being color blind.

Wait, no, because:

Males have 50% each, females have 50% each. So overall, 25% of all children will be color blind sons (50% son * 50% affected), 25% normal sons. 25% color blind daughters, and 25% normal daughters (but carriers).

So the phenotypic ratio is:

25% male, color blind.

25% male, normal.

25% female, color blind.

25% female, normal.

So looking at the options, which option matches this?

Looking back at the options:

Option D says (1/4) female, normal; (1/4) male, normal; (1/4) female, color blind; (1/4) male, color blind.

Which is exactly what I have. So each category is 25%.

Wait, but wait, what about the options? Let me check the options again.

Option A: All children normal. No.

Option B: (3/4 female normal, 1/4 female color; 3/4 male normal, 1/4 male color). No, my calculation is 50% for each gender.

Option C: Half females normal, half color; all males normal. No, because sons can be color blind.

Option D: As I thought, 25% each. So yes.

Option E: All female carriers, all males color blind. So all sons color blind (50%) and daughters carriers. No, because some daughters would be color blind.

Option F: All females color, males normal. No.

Option G: All females normal, all males color. No.

Option H: Each gender 50% each. So (1/2) female normal, (1/2) color; same for males. So 50% sons normal, 50% color. So overall, 25% each category. Wait, no. The way it's written, H says (1/2) female normal, (1/2) female color; same for males. So for each child, 50% chance of being female, and within that, 50% normal, 50% color. So combining, 25% female normal, 25% female color, 25% male normal, 25% male color. So same as D. So H and D seem similar.

Wait, looking at the options again:

Option D: (1/4) female normal; (1/4) male normal; (1/4) female color; (1/4) male color.

Option H: (1/2) female, normal; (1/2) female, color; (1/2) male, normal; (1/2) male, color.

Wait, H is phrased as 1/2 of the females have normal, 1/2 have color. Same with males. So for each gender, each condition is 50%.

So if half the children are female, then 25% of all children are female and color blind, 25% female and normal. Similarly, 25% male color, 25% male normal.

So that's the same as D. Wait, no. Because D says for each category, 25%, which is the same as H.

Wait, no. Let me calculate.

Wait, the overall probabilities for each category:

Daughters:

50% chance of being a daughter, and then 50% chance of being color blind. So 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25, or 25% of all children are daughters with color.

Same for daughters with normal: 25%.

Sons:

50% chance of being son, 50% chance of being color, so 25% of all children are color blind sons.

Same for normal sons: 25%.

So all four categories are 25% each.

So looking at the options, which one says that.

Option D: Each category is 25%.

Wait, Option D states:

(1/4) female, normal vision; (1/4) male, normal vision; (1/4) female, color blind; (1/4) male, color blind.

Yes, that's exactly the case. So the correct answer should be D.

Wait, but I thought earlier that H presents 50% each gender, but when considering all children, it comes to the same as D. Wait, what's the wording of H?

Option H: (1/2) female, normal; (1/2) female, color; (1/2) male, normal; (1/2) male, color.

Oh, wait, that's not correct because that would imply 50% of each gender, but each child is either male or female. So H would mean that 50% of the children are female, and within them, 50% normal, 50% color. Similarly for males. But that would mean 25% in each category, same as D.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me rephrase:

Option D says each category is a quarter of the total. So 25% in each of four categories.

Option H says, for females, half have normal, half color; same for males. So for all children, 25% in each category as well.

Wait, why are both D and H the same? Or perhaps I'm misinterpreting the options.

Wait, looking again:

Option D: (1/4) female, normal; (1/4) male, normal; (1/4) female, color; (1/4) male, color.

So each category is 25% of the total children.

Option H: (1/2) female, normal; (1/2) female, color; (1/2) male, normal; (1/2) male, color.

Wait, that can't be correct because that would require 50% + 50% for each gender, but that's impossible because each child is either male or female. So the way H is phrased, each gender's outcomes are 50% each. So for all children, 25% female normal, 25% female color, 25% male normal, 25% male color. Which is the same as D.

Wait, but that's impossible because both options D and H can't be correct. So perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the options.

Wait, perhaps H is phrased differently. Let me read H again.

Option H: (1/2) female, normal vision; (1/2) female, color blind; (1/2) male, normal vision; (1/2) male, color blind.

Wait, that would mean that 50% of the females are normal, 50% are color blind. Similarly for males. So for all children, 25% are female normal, 25% female color, 25% male normal, 25% male color. So H is the same as D, which can't be correct because the options are unique.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the gamete analysis.

Wait, the woman is XBXb, the man is XbY.

So the possible children:

Daughters receive X from father (Xb) and X from mother (either XB or Xb).

So 50% XBXb (normal) and 50% XbXb (color).

Sons receive X from mother (50% XB, 50% Xb) and Y from father.

So 50% XBY (normal) and 50% XbY (color).

So for each child:

- 50% chance of being a daughter: 25% XBXb, 25% XbXb.

- 50% chance of being a son: 25% XBY, 25% XbY.

So the phenotypic ratio is:

25% daughters (normal), 25% daughters (color), 25% sons (normal), 25% sons (color).

Which matches option D.

So the correct answer should be D.
</think>

Red-green color blindness is caused by a recessive sex-linked gene located on the X chromosome. Males are affected if they inherit the recessive allele (XbY), while females must inherit two copies of the recessive allele (XbXb) to express the condition. Females with one dominant and one recessive allele (XBXb) are carriers but have normal vision.

In this scenario:

1. The man is color-blind, so his genotype is **XbY**.
2. The woman has normal vision but is a carrier because her father was color-blind (XbY). Therefore, her genotype is **XBXb**.

### Gametes and Offspring
- **Man (XbY):** Produces 50% **Xb** gametes and 50% **Y** gametes.
- **Woman (XBXb):** Produces 50% **XB** gametes and 50% **Xb** gametes.

#### Sons (receive X from mother and Y from father):
- If the mother contributes **XB**, the son is **XBY** (normal vision).
- If the mother contributes **Xb**, the son is **XbY** (color-blind).

Thus, 50% of sons will have normal vision, and 50% will be color-blind.

#### Daughters (receive X from both parents):
- If the mother contributes **XB** and the father contributes **Xb**, the daughter is **XBXb** (carrier with normal vision).
- If the mother contributes **Xb** and the father contributes **Xb**, the daughter is **XbXb** (color-blind).

Thus, 50% of daughters will have normal vision (but be carriers), and 50% will be color-blind.

### Overall Phenotypic Results
- **Sons:** 50% normal vision, 50% color-blind.
- **Daughters:** 50% normal vision (carriers), 50% color-blind.

Since each child has a 50% chance of being male or female, the overall phenotypic distribution is:
- 25% female, normal vision (XBXb).
- 25% female, color-blind (XbXb).
- 25% male, normal vision (XBY).
- 25% male, color-blind (XbY).

### Correct Option
The option that matches this distribution is:

**D: (1/4) female, normal vision; (1/4) male, normal vision; (1/4) female, color blind; (1/4) male, color blind.**
