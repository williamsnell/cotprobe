Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the Earth's radius decreasing and how that affects the length of the day. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says the Earth's radius decreases by half a percent. So that's a 0.5% decrease. I need to find out how this change affects the length of a day, which I think relates to the Earth's rotation period. So, how does the radius tie into the day length?

I remember that the Earth's moment of inertia plays a role here. The formula given is I = (2/5) m R². Moment of inertia is important for rotational motion. Oh right, when something's moment of inertia changes, its rotational speed changes if there's conservation of angular momentum. 

Wait, angular momentum L is the product of the moment of inertia I and the angular velocity ω. So L = I * ω. If the radius R decreases, I changes. But if there's no external torque, L should remain constant. So I1 * ω1 = I2 * ω2. 

Let me set up the initial and final moments of inertia. Initially, I1 = (2/5) m R². After the radius decreases by 0.5%, the new radius R2 is R * (1 - 0.005) = 0.995 R. So the new moment of inertia I2 would be (2/5) m (R2)^2. Plugging in R2, that's (2/5) m (0.995 R)^2. 

Wait, so I2 = I1 * (0.995)^2, because I1 is (2/5 m R²), and R2 squared is (0.995 R)^2 = (0.995)^2 R². So I2 = I1 * (0.995)^2.

Since angular momentum is conserved (no external torque), I1 ω1 = I2 ω2. So ω2 = ω1 * (I1 / I2). Substituting I2 as I1*(0.995)^2, this becomes ω2 = ω1 * (1 / (0.995)^2).

Calculating 1/(0.995)^2: Let me compute 0.995 squared first. 0.995 * 0.995 = let's see, 1 - 0.005 squared. (a - b)^2 = a² - 2ab + b². So 1 - 0.01 + 0.000025 = 0.990025. So 1/0.990025 is approximately 1.010075. So ω2 is about 1.010075 times ω1. 

That means the angular velocity increases by roughly 1.0075% (since 0.010075 is about 1.0075%). 

Now, angular velocity ω is 2π divided by the period T, the length of the day. So ω = 2π / T. If ω increases, T must decrease because they're inversely related. 

So let's denote T1 as the original length of the day, and T2 as the new length after the radius decreases. We have ω2 = 1.010075 ω1. So 2π / T2 = 1.010075 * (2π / T1). The 2π cancels out, so 1/T2 = 1.010075 / T1 → T2 = T1 / 1.010075 ≈ T1 * (1 / 1.010075).

Hmm, let me compute 1 / 1.010075. I think approximately, 1.01 times something. Let's approximate 1/1.010075 ≈ 0.990075, because 1.01 * 0.9901 is about 0.99999, so close to 1. So T2 ≈ T1 * 0.990075. 

Wait, wait a second. Wait, actually, let me double-check that. If I have a small change x, 1/(1+x) ≈ 1 - x when x is small. Since 0.010075 is about 1%, which is small, so 1/(1 + 0.010075) ≈ 1 - 0.010075 = 0.989925. So T2 ≈ T1 * 0.989925. 

So the new period T2 is approximately 0.989925 times the original T1, meaning the day length decreases by about 1.075% (since 1 - 0.989925 = 0.010075, or 1.0075%).

Wait, wait, but I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me retrace. If ω increases by ~1.0075%, that means the rotational speed increases, so the day length (period) decreases. The percentage change in T would be approximately - (1.0075)% because T is inversely proportional to ω. 

So, the day length decreases by about 1.0075%. Let's calculate the change in minutes. 

But what's the current length of a day in minutes? I think it's roughly 24 hours, which is 24 * 60 = 1440 minutes. 

So a 1.0075% change would be 1440 * 0.010075 ≈ let's compute that. 1440 * 0.01 is 14.4 minutes. 0.000075 * 1440 is 0.108 minutes, so total change is about 14.4 + 0.108 = approximately 14.508 minutes. Wait, but that's a decrease, so the day length would be about 14.5 minutes shorter? But looking at the options, the closest is option J: 14.28 minutes. But wait, wait, let me be precise.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the exact value. Let me compute the exact factor. Let's compute the exact 1/(1 + x), where x is the fractional change in the radius. Wait, the radius changes by 1/2 percent, so R becomes R' = R * (1 - 0.005) = 0.995 R. 

So the moment of inertia I is proportional to R². So I' = I * (0.995)^2. 

So the change in I is I' = I * (0.995)^2 ≈ I * (1 - 0.01 + 0.000025) ≈ I * 0.990025. So I' is 0.990025 I.

Since angular momentum L = I ω is conserved, I ω = I' ω', so ω' = (I / I') ω = (1 / 0.990025) ω ≈ 1.010075 ω.

So ω' = 1.010075 ω. Therefore, the angular speed increases by about 1.0075%.

The period T is 2π/ω, so T' = 2π/ω' = (2π)/(1.010075 ω) ) = T / 1.010075 ≈ T * (1 - 0.010075 + (0.010075)^2 - ...) ≈ T (1 - 0.010075). 

So the fractional change in T is approximately -0.010075, or -1.0075%.

So the change in the length of the day is a decrease of about 1.0075% of 1440 minutes.

Calculate 1440 * 0.010075. Let's do it step by step.

0.01 * 1440 = 14.4.
0.000075 * 1440 = 0.108.

Adding them gives 14.4 + 0.108 = 14.508 minutes.

So the day length decreases by approximately 14.51 minutes.

Looking at the options, option J is 14.28, which is close but a bit less. Hmm, perhaps my approximation is a bit off because I used a linear approximation. Maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, let me compute the exact change. Let me compute (0.995)^2 exactly. 0.995 * 0.995 = (1 - 0.005)^2 = 1 - 0.01 + 0.000025 = 0.990025.

So I' = 0.990025 I. So the ratio I / I' is 1 / 0.990025 ≈ 1.01007514.

So the new angular velocity ω' = (I/I') ω = 1.01007514 ω.

Then, the new period T' = 2π / ω' = (2π)/(1.01007514 ω) ) = T / 1.01007514.

So T' = T * (1 / 1.01007514) ≈ T * 0.990075. So the change in T is T - T' = T (1 - 0.990075) )= T * 0.009925.

So the change is 0.9925% of T. So 0.009925 * 1440 minutes.

Calculate 0.009925 * 1440:

Let me compute 1440 * 0.01 = 14.4, and 1440 * (0.009925 - 0.01) = 1440 * (-0.000075) = -0.108.

So 14.4 - 0.108 = 14.292 minutes.

Ah, so approximately 14.292 minutes decrease. Looking at the options, option J is 14.28 minutes, which is very close. The slight difference might be due to more precise calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 0.009925 * 1440 exactly.

0.009925 = 992.5e-5.

So 992.5e-5 * 1440 = (992.5 * 1440) / 1e5.

Let me compute 992.5 * 1440.

First, 1000 * 1440 = 1,440,000.

Subtract 7.5 * 1440: 7.5 * 1440 = 10,800.

So 1,440,000 - 10,800 = 1,429,200.

Now, 1,429,200 / 1e5 = 14.292 minutes.

So the change is 14.292 minutes, which is approximately 14.29 minutes. Looking at the options, the closest is option J:14.28. But wait, the options don't have 14.29. Let me see the options again.

The options are:

A: 18.46

B:22.15

C:20.34

D:19.78

E:7.22

F:12.36

G:10.12

H:8.54

I:16.42

J:14.28

So 14.292 is very close to J:14.28. But wait, why isn't it exactly matching? Maybe because the approximation of 1/(0.995)^2 as 1.010075 is slightly off. Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in assuming that the Earth's moment of inertia is (2/5) MR². Wait, yes, that's correct for a solid sphere. So that part is right.

Wait another thought: When the radius decreases, the Earth's density increases because mass remains the same (the problem doesn't mention mass change). So the moment of inertia decreases, leading to a faster rotation (since L is conserved). So the period T decreases, which is what we're calculating. 

Wait, another angle: If the Earth's radius decreases, the moment of inertia decreases, and because L is conserved, the angular velocity increases. So the day gets shorter. 

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not miscalculating the percentage change. The question is about the change in the length of the day. So if the day was 1440 minutes, the change is a decrease of about 14.29 minutes, so the day becomes 1440 -14.29=1425.71 minutes.

So the answer should be approximately 14.29 minutes, which is very close to option J:14.28.

Wait, but wait, maybe the exact calculation would be better. Let me compute 1/(0.995)^2 exactly.

0.995^2 = 0.990025.

So 1/0.990025 = approx 1.0100751282.

So the ratio is 1.0100751282.

Thus, the new angular velocity ω' is 1.0100751282 times the original.

So the period T' is T / 1.0100751282.

So the fractional change in period is (T - T')/T = (1 - (1/1.0100751282)).

Compute 1/1.0100751282 exactly:

Let me compute 1 / 1.0100751282.

Well, 1.01 is 1.01, and 1/1.01 = 0.9900990099.

But our denominator is 1.0100751282, which is a bit larger than 1.01, so the reciprocal is a bit smaller than 0.990099.

Let me compute 1.0100751282 = 1.01 + 0.0000751282.

So using the approximation 1/(a + b) ≈ 1/a - b/(a²) when b is small.

So a =1.01, b=0.0000751282.

1/(1.01 + 0.0000751282) ≈ 1/1.01 - (0.0000751282)/(1.01)^2.

Compute 1/1.01 ≈ 0.9900990099.

Compute denominator (1.01)^2 = 1.0201.

So (0.0000751282)/(1.0201) ≈ 7.368e-5.

So 1/(1.01 + 0.0000751282) ≈ 0.9900990099 - 0.00007368 ≈ 0.99002533.

So the period T' is 0.99002533 * T. So the change is T - T' = T (1 - 0.99002533) = T * 0.00997467.

So 0.00997467 of 1440 minutes is 0.00997467 * 1440 = let's compute exactly.

0.00997467 * 1440:

First, 1440 * 0.009 = 12.96.

1440 * 0.00097467 = Let's calculate 0.0009 * 1440 = 1.296, and 0.00007467*1440=0.1075 (approximately).

So 1.296 + 0.1075 ≈ 1.4035.

So total is 12.96 +1.4035=14.3635 minutes.

Wait, that's about 14.36 minutes, which is a bit higher than the previous calculation. Hmm, this is confusing. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this with approximations. Let me compute it more accurately.

Compute 0.00997467 * 1440.

0.00997467 * 1440 = ?

Let me compute 1440 * 0.00997467.

First, 1440 * 0.009 = 12.96.

Then, 1440 * 0.00097467.

Compute 1440 * 0.0009 = 1.296.

1440 * 0.00007467 = 0.1075.

So 1.296 + 0.1075 = 1.4035.

So total change is 12.96 + 1.4035 = 14.3635 minutes.

Wait, that's about 14.36 minutes. So the change is a decrease of 14.36 minutes. But none of the options exactly match that. The closest is option J:14.28.

Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I should compute the exact value without approximations.

Compute 0.009925 *1440.

Wait, earlier I had 0.009925 as the fractional change. Wait, 0.009925 *1440=?

Let me compute 1440 * 0.009 =12.96, 1440 *0.000925=1.317. So 12.96 +1.317=14.277 minutes.

Oh wait, 14.277 minutes is approximately 14.28 minutes, which matches option J.

Wait, wait, where did 0.009925 come from? Let me retrace.

Earlier, I thought that the fractional change in the period was 0.009925, which is 0.9925%. So 0.009925 *1440 = 14.28 minutes.

So that's correct. So the change is approximately 14.28 minutes, which is option J.

So the answer should be J.

To determine the change in the length of the day when the Earth's radius decreases by 0.5%, we use the principle of conservation of angular momentum. The Earth's moment of inertia is given as \( I = \frac{2}{5} m R^2 \), and angular momentum \( L \) is conserved, so \( I_1 \omega_1 = I_2 \omega_2 \).

### Step 1: New moment of inertia
When the radius decreases by 0.5%, the new radius is \( R_2 = 0.995R \). The new moment of inertia is:
\[
I_2 = I_1 \cdot (0.995)^2 = I_1 \cdot 0.990025
\]

### Step 2: Change in angular velocity
Using conservation of angular momentum:
\[
\omega_2 = \omega_1 \cdot \frac{I_1}{I_2} = \omega_1 \cdot \frac{1}{0.990025} \approx \omega_1 \cdot 1.010075
\]
Thus, the angular velocity increases by approximately 1.0075%.

### Step 3: Change in the length of the day
The length of the day is inversely proportional to angular velocity. If the original day length is \( T_1 = 1440 \, \text{minutes} \), the new day length is:
\[
T_2 = T_1 \cdot \frac{1}{1.010075} \approx T_1 \cdot 0.990075
\]
The fractional change in the day length is:
\[
\Delta T = T_1 - T_2 = T_1 \cdot (1 - 0.990075) = T_1 \cdot 0.009925
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the change in minutes
Substituting \( T_1 = 1440 \, \text{minutes} \):
