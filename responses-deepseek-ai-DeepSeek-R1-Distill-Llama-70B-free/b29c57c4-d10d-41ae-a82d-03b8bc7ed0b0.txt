Question:

At 10:00p. m. onNovember 14, a driver was operating his automobile along Main Street. As the driver was approaching the intersection of Main Street and First Avenue, a motorist, who was driving straight through a red light, suddenly appeared before him. Trying to avoid the motorist, the driver veered his car onto the sidewalk. The car landed in a deep hole in the sidewalk. This hole had been dug by a construction company, which had been repairing a water main break earlier in the day. The construction company had been hired by the local municipal water department. Although the' construction company had erected a warning sign advising pedestrians about the hole, there was no fence or barrier surrounding it. When the driver's car fell into the hole, it ruptured the water main, engulfing the car with water. Within a short time, the driver, unable to escape, drowned in his car, which rapidly filled with water. In a wrongful death action by the driver's estate against the municipal water department, the estate will most probably

Options:

A: not prevail, because the municipal water department would not be liable for the negligence of its independent contractor.
B: not prevail, because the driver was negligent for driving onto the sidewalk.
C: prevail, as the municipal water department is responsible for the safe operation of its contractors.
D: prevail, because the city government would be strictly liable for failing to ensure the water main repair work was done properly.
E: not prevail, as the municipal water department had no control over the actions of the driver or the other motorist.
F: not prevail, because sovereign immunity attaches to functions that are governmental in nature.
G: prevail, because the construction company failed to adequately warn the public of the hazard.
H: not prevail, because the accident was caused by the actions of another motorist, not the municipal water department.
I: prevail, because sovereign immunity would not attach to non-delegable duties, which are proprietary in nature.
J: prevail, because the municipal water department failed to ensure that the construction company had put adequate safety measures in place.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about a wrongful death case, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's start by understanding the situation.

The incident happened at 10:00 p.m. on November 14th. A driver was on Main Street approaching an intersection when another motorist ran a red light. To avoid that, the driver swerved onto the sidewalk and hit a deep hole dug by a construction company. The company was hired by the municipal water department to fix a water main break. They had a warning sign but no fence or barrier. The car fell into the hole, ruptured the water main, and the driver drowned.

The question is whether the driver's estate can successfully sue the municipal water department for wrongful death.

First, I need to think about the legal principles involved here. The key points are about liability, particularly vicarious liability and whether the municipality can be held responsible for the actions of an independent contractor.

Option A says the estate won't prevail because the municipal department isn't liable for an independent contractor's negligence. I remember that generally, municipalities aren't liable for the negligence of independent contractors they hire because they don't control the contractor's work. But there are exceptions, like if the municipality fails to exercise reasonable care in selecting the contractor or if the work is inherently dangerous.

Option B suggests the driver was negligent for driving onto the sidewalk. That might be a factor, but the question is about whether the municipal department is liable, not whether the driver's own actions could bar recovery. So maybe this is a contributory negligence point, but I'm not sure if that's the main issue here.

Option C claims the department is responsible for their contractors' safe operations. But again, unless they had direct control or the work was inherently dangerous, I don't think so.

Option D says strict liability because the city didn't ensure proper repair. Strict liability is usually for inherently dangerous activities. If the repair wasn't done safely, maybe, but the hole was from the construction, not the repair itself. The contractor had a sign but no barrier.

Option E says the department isn't liable because they didn't control the driver or other motorist. That's probably true, but the issue is the hole, not the drivers. So maybe not the best option.

Option F talks about sovereign immunity for governmental functions. Municipalities often have sovereign immunity for governmental functions, like providing water services. But sometimes, when they perform proprietary functions (like a business would), immunity doesn't apply. So if the water main repair is a governmental function, then they might have immunity. But if it's considered proprietary, then maybe not.

Option G says the construction company failed to warn, so the department is liable. But the department isn't directly responsible unless the contractor's actions can be attributed to them, which usually isn't the case unless there's some exception.

Option H claims the accident was another motorist's fault, so the department isn't liable. The other motorist caused the driver to swerve, but the dangerous condition (the hole) was created by the contractor. So the department's liability would depend on their responsibility for that hole, not the other driver.

Option I says they'll prevail because sovereign immunity doesn't apply to non-delegable duties that are proprietary. So if the water department's work is a proprietary function, they can't claim immunity. Proprietary functions are those that a municipality undertakes for profit, like running a utility. Governmental functions are more like public safety. So if the water main repair is a proprietary function, then sovereign immunity wouldn't protect them.

Option J says the department failed to ensure adequate safety measures. This goes back to whether the department had a duty to ensure the contractor provided barriers. If the work was inherently dangerous, the municipality might have a non-delegable duty to ensure safety, regardless of using a contractor.

So putting it together: The key issues are whether the municipal department can be held liable for the contractor's negligence and whether sovereign immunity applies.

If the water department is performing a governmental function, they might have sovereign immunity. But if it's a proprietary function, like operating water services for a fee, then they might not. Alternatively, if the work was inherently dangerous, the municipality might have a non-delegable duty, making them liable even if they hired a contractor.

Looking at the options again:

A: Not liable because independent contractor. But if it's a non-delegable duty, A might not apply.

I: Prevail because sovereign immunity doesn't attach to proprietary non-delegable duties.

J: Prevail because the department failed to ensure safety measures.

So which is it? The question is whether the municipality had a duty to ensure safety regardless of hiring a contractor. If the repair was inherently dangerous, the municipality might still be liable. Or if the function is proprietary, then sovereign immunity doesn't apply.

In many jurisdictions, water supply is considered a proprietary function. So if that's the case, sovereign immunity (option F) wouldn't protect them. Then, the question is whether the department is liable for the contractor's negligence because the function is proprietary.

But wait, even if it's a proprietary function, does that automatically make the municipality liable for the contractor's actions? Or does it just mean they can be sued, but they're not automatically liable unless they were negligent.

Alternatively, if the work was inherently dangerous, the municipality can't delegate the duty, so they might be liable.

So option J says the department failed to ensure adequate safety measures. If the contractor didn't put up barriers, but the department was responsible to ensure they did, then the department would be negligent.

Alternatively, option I says sovereign immunity doesn't apply because it's a proprietary function, so the estate would prevail.

So the possible answers are I and J.

But the question is about the estate's case against the municipal water department. So if the department is liable because they failed to ensure safety measures (like barriers), that's option J. If the issue is about sovereign immunity not applying, then it's option I.

In this scenario, the construction company had a sign but no fence. Maybe a sign isn't enough, so the department might be negligent for not ensuring better safety measures.

So option J says the department failed to ensure adequate safety. That sounds correct.

Alternatively, option I says they'll prevail because sovereign immunity doesn't apply to proprietary functions. So if the function is proprietary, the department can be sued, but the question is whether they were negligent.

Wait, but the options don't all match up. Let me think again.

The general rule is that a municipality isn't liable for the negligence of an independent contractor unless:

1. The work is inherently dangerous, so the duty can't be delegated.

2. The municipality was negligent in selecting the contractor.

3. The municipality retained control over the work.

4. The work is a proprietary function, and the municipality has a non-delegable duty.

So if the water main repair is a governmental function, the municipality might have sovereign immunity. If it's proprietary, they don't, and then their potential liability depends on their own negligence.

But in this case, the hole was dug by the contractor, and the department didn't provide a fence. So the department might have been negligent in not ensuring that the contractor took adequate precautions.

So the correct answer would be J: because the department failed to ensure adequate safety measures.

Wait, but another angle: The driver's action of swerving onto the sidewalk might be considered contributory negligence. But in many jurisdictions, contributory negligence is a defense only if it's a proximate cause. However, the question doesn't focus on that; it's about the department's liability.

So putting it all together, the best options seem to be I and J.

Option I says the estate will prevail because sovereign immunity doesn't attach to non-delegable, proprietary duties.

Option J says the estate will prevail because the department failed to ensure safety measures.

I think the key here is whether the function is governmental or proprietary. If it's proprietary, sovereign immunity doesn't apply, making I correct. But if the issue is about the department's own negligence in not ensuring safety, then J is correct.

Alternatively, if the function is governmental, then F would apply, but I think water services are often considered proprietary.

So the answer might be I or J.

Wait, another approach: The municipality is responsible for the condition of the sidewalk. If they hired a contractor who created a dangerous condition without proper barriers, the municipality might have a non-delegable duty to ensure public safety, especially if the work was under their supervision or if it's a proprietary function.

So perhaps the answer is J, that the department failed to ensure adequate safety.

Alternatively, option I says they'll prevail because sovereign immunity doesn't apply to proprietary non-delegable duties.

I think I'm getting a bit stuck, but I'll try to pick the best option.

If the water department is a proprietary function, then sovereign immunity (option F) doesn't apply, so option I says they'll prevail because immunity doesn't attach. But that's only part of the story; the other part is whether they were negligent.

Wait, but option I says "because sovereign immunity would not attach to non-delegable duties, which are proprietary in nature." So it's about the duties being non-delegable, making the department liable regardless of the contractor's actions.

Alternatively, option J is about the department's failure to ensure safety, which is about their own negligence.

I think the correct answer is J because the department had a duty to ensure the contractor provided adequate safety measures, and their failure to do so makes them liable.

The question revolves around whether the driver's estate can successfully sue the municipal water department for wrongful death after the driver's car fell into a hole dug by a construction company hired by the department. The key issues are municipal liability for an independent contractor's negligence, sovereign immunity, and the nature of the function (governmental vs. proprietary).

1. **Municipal Liability for Independent Contractor**: Generally, municipalities are not liable for the negligence of independent contractors unless exceptions apply, such as inherently dangerous work, failure to exercise care in selecting the contractor, or retained control over the work. Here, the construction company had a warning sign but no fence, which could indicate inadequate safety measures.

2. **Sovereign Immunity**: Sovereign immunity protects municipalities for governmental functions but not necessarily for proprietary functions (e.g., operating utilities for profit). If the water main repair is considered a proprietary function, sovereign immunity would not apply.

3. **Non-Delegable Duty**: Even if the work is delegated to a contractor, municipalities may have a non-delegable duty to ensure public safety, especially for inherently dangerous activities. The absence of a fence around the hole could constitute a failure to meet this duty.

4. **Negligence in Safety Measures**: The municipal water department's failure to ensure the contractor implemented adequate safety measures (e.g., no fence) could constitute negligence, making the department liable.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Incorrect. While municipalities are generally not liable for independent contractors, exceptions like non-delegable duties or proprietary functions could apply.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The driver's negligence in swerving onto the sidewalk is not the primary issue; the focus is on the municipal department's liability.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. Municipalities are not automatically responsible for contractors' safe operations unless specific exceptions apply.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Strict liability requires inherently dangerous activities, which may not apply here.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The issue is not the department's control over the drivers but the dangerous condition created by the contractor.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. Sovereign immunity may not apply if the function is proprietary.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The construction company's failure to warn is secondary; the department's own negligence is the key issue.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The other motorist's actions do not absolve the department of liability for the dangerous condition.
- **Option I**: Plausible. Sovereign immunity may not apply if the function is proprietary, but this does not fully address the department's negligence in ensuring safety.
- **Option J**: Best Answer. The department failed to ensure adequate safety measures, such as installing a fence, which constitutes negligence.

### Conclusion:
The municipal water department's failure to ensure the construction company implemented adequate safety measures, such as a fence, makes them liable for the accident. This negligence outweighs other considerations like sovereign immunity or independent contractor rules.
