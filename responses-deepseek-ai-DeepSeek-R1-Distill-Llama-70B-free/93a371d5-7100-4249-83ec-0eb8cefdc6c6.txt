Okay, so I have this question about rule consequentialism, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me start by recalling what I know about ethical theories. Rule consequentialism is a type of utilitarianism, right? But it's different from act consequentialism. 

From what I remember, act consequentialism says that the rightness of an action is determined by its consequences. So, you look at each individual action and see if it maximizes overall happiness or utility. But rule consequentialism is a bit different. Instead of looking at each action separately, it focuses on rules. The idea is that if a rule, when followed, leads to the best possible consequences overall, then actions that follow that rule are right.

So the question is asking, according to rule consequentialism, what determines the rightness or wrongness of an action. The options are A through J. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: The individual's personal beliefs and morals at the time of the action. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. Rule consequentialism is about general rules, not personal beliefs. So probably not A.

Option B: Whether a virtuous person would endorse a rule requiring, permitting, or prohibiting that action. Wait, this sounds more like virtue ethics, where the virtuous person's perspective matters. Rule consequentialism is more about the rules' consequences, not what a virtuous person thinks. So maybe B isn't correct.

Option C: That action's relationship to the operative rules of law. No, rule consequentialism isn't about legal rules but about moral rules. So C is probably wrong.

Option D: The action's alignment with universally accepted human rights. I don't think this is directly related. Rule consequentialism is more about the overall utility of the rules, not specific rights. So D might not be the answer.

Option E: The immediate consequences of the action, regardless of any established rules. That sounds like act consequentialism, which focuses on the individual action's consequences, not the rules. So E is probably incorrect.

Option F: The logical consistency behind the motive of actions of the same type. I'm not too sure about this. It sounds a bit abstract. Rule consequentialism is about rules leading to good outcomes, not about the consistency of motives. So F doesn't seem right.

Option G: Whether a religious doctrine approves or disapproves of the action. No, rule consequentialism isn't based on religious teachings. It's about the consequences of following rules. So G is out.

Option H: Whether the action aligns with the principles of utilitarianism. Well, rule consequentialism is a form of utilitarianism, but the question is about what determines rightness. I think this is too broad because utilitarianism can include both act and rule versions. So H might not be specific enough.

Option I: The societal norms and customs relevant to the action. While societal norms are rules, rule consequentialism evaluates whether those rules are justified by their consequences. But I think the key is whether the rule itself is one that would produce the best consequences if accepted. So I might not be the exact answer.

Option J: Whether that action is required, permitted, or prohibited by a rule the consequences of which are best. This sounds exactly like rule consequentialism. The rightness depends on whether the action follows a rule that, when generally followed, leads to the best overall consequences. So J seems correct.

Wait, let me double-check. Rule consequentialism says that an action is right if it conforms to a rule that, when included in our moral code, produces the greatest overall utility. So the rightness is based on whether the action is part of such a best-consequence rule. So yes, J fits that description.

According to rule consequentialism, the rightness or wrongness of an action is determined by whether the action adheres to a rule that, when generally followed, leads to the best possible overall consequences. This means the focus is on the utility of the rule itself, not on individual actions or other factors like personal beliefs, societal norms, or religious doctrines.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. Rule consequentialism is not based on personal beliefs or morals.
- **B**: Incorrect. This aligns more with virtue ethics, not rule consequentialism.
- **C**: Incorrect. It focuses on moral rules, not legal rules.
- **D**: Incorrect. It is about the utility of rules, not human rights.
- **E**: Incorrect. This describes act consequentialism, not rule consequentialism.
- **F**: Incorrect. It is unrelated to the logical consistency of motives.
- **G**: Incorrect. Religious doctrine is not the basis for rule consequentialism.
- **H**: Incorrect. While related to utilitarianism, it is too broad and nonspecific.
- **I**: Incorrect. Societal norms are not the sole determinant in rule consequentialism.
- **J**: Correct. This accurately reflects the principle of rule consequentialism, where the rightness of an action depends on its alignment with a rule that maximizes overall utility.
