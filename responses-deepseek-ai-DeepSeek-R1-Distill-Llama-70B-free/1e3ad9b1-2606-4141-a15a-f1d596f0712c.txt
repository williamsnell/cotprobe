Okay, so I have this math problem here: estimate 153 plus 44, and figure out between which numbers the sum falls. The options are from A to J, each with different ranges. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.

First, I should probably add 153 and 44. Wait, but the question says to estimate, right? So maybe I don't need the exact sum. Estimating usually involves rounding to make the calculation easier.

Let me think about rounding these numbers. 153 is close to 150, and 44 is close to 40. So if I round 153 up to 150 and 44 down to 40, adding those gives me 190. Oh wait, but that's rounding both. Alternatively, maybe I should round each to the nearest ten. 153 is 150, and 44 is 40. So 150 + 40 is 190. But wait, 153 is actually 3 more than 150, and 44 is 4 more than 40. So the exact sum would be 190 plus 7, which is 197. But since the question is about estimating, maybe just knowing it's around 190 is enough.

Alternatively, maybe I should round each number to the nearest hundred. 153 is about 100, and 44 is about 0. Wait, that doesn't make sense. No, 44 is closer to 100 than to 0, but 44 is actually in the tens. Hmm, maybe that's not the right approach.

Wait, perhaps I should look at the options to see what ranges they're in. Let me check the options:

Option A: 1,100 and 1,299. That's way too high.

Option B: 900 and 1,099. Also too high.

Option C: 50 and 99. Too low.

Option D: 100 and 299. Hmm, 197 is in this range.

Option E: 400 and 599.

Option F: 500 and 699.

Option G: 700 and 899.

Option H: 300 and 499.

Option I: 200 and 399.

Option J: 600 and 799.

Wait, so 153 +44 is 197. Let me compute that exactly. 153 +44: 153 +40 is 193, plus 4 is 197.

So 197 is between 100 and 299, which is option D. But wait, let me check the other options. Option I is 200-399. So 197 is just below 200, so it's not in I. So the correct range is D: 100-299.

But wait, let me make sure. Are there any options that more precisely capture this? Let's see, the sum is 197. So which option includes 197?

Looking back, option D is 100-299, which includes 197. Option H is 300-499, which is higher. So the correct answer must be D.

The sum of 153 and 44 is 197. Among the given options, 197 falls within the range of 100 to 299.

Answer: D
