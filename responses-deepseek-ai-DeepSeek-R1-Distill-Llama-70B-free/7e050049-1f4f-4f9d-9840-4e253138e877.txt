Alright, so I'm trying to find the inverse Laplace transform of F(s) = (2s + 4)/(s² + 2s +5). Hmm, okay, I remember that Laplace transforms often involve breaking down the function into parts that match known transforms, like time shifts or damping. 

First, I think I should complete the square in the denominator to make it easier to handle. The denominator is s² + 2s +5. Completing the square: s² + 2s +1 +4 = (s+1)^2 +4. So the denominator becomes (s+1)^2 + (2)^2. That looks like the form for a damped sinusoid.

So F(s) can be rewritten as (2s +4)/[(s+1)^2 +4]. I think I can split the numerator into two parts to match standard Laplace transform pairs. Let me try to express 2s +4 in terms that fit the denominator.

Wait, maybe I can rewrite the numerator as 2(s+1) + 2. Let me check that: 2(s+1) is 2s+2, so adding 2 gives 2s+4. Perfect. So F(s) becomes [2(s+1) +2]/[(s+1)^2 +4].

Now, split this into two fractions: [2(s+1)]/[(s+1)^2 +4] + [2]/[(s+1)^2 +4]. 

Each part should now correspond to a known Laplace transform. 

The first term, 2(s+1)/[(s+1)^2 +4], looks like the Laplace transform of 2e^{-t}cos(2t), because L{e^{-at}cos(bt)} = (s+a)/[(s+a)^2 +b²], right? So when a=1 and b=2, it's 2*(s+1)/[(s+1)^2 +4] → 2e^{-t}cos(2t).

The second term is 2/[(s+1)^2 +4]. The Laplace transform of e^{-at}sin(bt) is b/[(s+a)^2 +b²]. So here, a=1 and b=2. So 2/(denominator) would correspond to (2/2) * 2 e^{-t} sin(2t). Wait, wait. Let me think again. The standard form is L{e^{-at} sin(bt)} = b/[(s+a)^2 +b²]. So if I have 2 in the numerator, that's 2 * [ b/( (s+a)^2 +b² ) ] where a=1, b=2. So 2 * [ 2/( (s+1)^2 +4 ) ] → 2 * 2 e^{-t} sin(2t) /2? Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, no, the Laplace transform of e^{-t} sin(2t) is 2/(s² + 2s +5), which is our denominator. So if the numerator is 2, then it's (2) * [ 2/((s+1)^2 +4) ] → 2 * [e^{-t} sin(2t) * 2 ]? Wait, no, wait. Let me correct that.

The standard transform is L{e^{-at} sin(bt)} = b / [ (s+a)^2 + b² ]. So if I have 2 in the numerator, it's like 2 * [1/((s+1)^2 +4)] * 2? Hmm, maybe I should write it differently. Let's see:

The second term is 2/((s+1)^2 +4). Let's factor out the 2: 2 * [1/((s+1)^2 +4)]. From the standard transform, [1/((s+a)^2 +b²)] corresponds to (1/b) e^{-at} sin(bt). So here, a=1, b=2. So 1/((s+1)^2 +4) is (1/2) e^{-t} sin(2t). So 2 times that would be 2*(1/2) e^{-t} sin(2t) → e^{-t} sin(2t).

Putting it all together, the inverse Laplace transform of F(s) is 2e^{-t} cos(2t) + e^{-t} sin(2t). Wait, but looking at the options, let me check. Option I says 2e^-t cos2t + e^-t sin2t, which matches what I have here. 

But wait, let me make sure I didn't mix up the coefficients. The first term was 2(s+1)/denominator, which gave 2e^{-t} cos(2t). The second term was 2/denominator, which after considering the standard form, became e^{-t} sin(2t). So yes, adding them gives 2e^{-t} cos(2t) + e^{-t} sin(2t), which is option I.

Wait, but looking again at the options, option I is: I: f(t) = 2e^-t cos2t + e^-t sin 2t. That's exactly what I got. So the correct answer should be I.

But wait, the question also asks for a generalized Laplace transform pair to add to a table. So the form would be something like (As + B)/[(s+a)^2 + b²], and its inverse. Let me think about that. The approach I took was to split the numerator into terms that fit the denominator's completed square, which allowed me to express F(s) as a sum of terms that match known transforms. So the generalized pair would be something like L^{-1} {(Ms + N)/[(s+a)^2 + b²]} = M e^{-at} cos(bt) + (N - a M)/b e^{-at} sin(bt). Or maybe I should derive it more carefully.

Let me consider a general function F(s) = (Ms + N)/[(s+a)^2 + b²]. Let's split it into parts: F(s) = [M(s+a) + (N - a M)] / [(s+a)^2 + b²]. Then, F(s) = M(s+a)/[(s+a)^2 + b²] + (N - a M)/( (s+a)^2 +b² ). 

The first term is M times (s+a)/[(s+a)^2 +b²], whose inverse is M e^{-a t} cos(b t). The second term is (N - a M) times 1/( (s+a)^2 +b² ), whose inverse is (N - a M)/b e^{-a t} sin(b t). 

So the inverse Laplace transform is f(t) = M e^{-a t} cos(b t) + [(N - a M)/b] e^{-a t} sin(b t).

In our problem, M=2, N=4, a=1, b=2. So plugging in, we get 2 e^{-t} cos(2t) + [(4 -1*2)/2] e^{-t} sin(2t). (4-2)/2 is 1. So 2 e^{-t} cos(2t) + 1 e^{-t} sin(2t), which matches our earlier result.

So the generalized pair would be:

L^{-1} { (Ms + N)/[(s +a)^2 + b²] } = M e^{-a t} cos(b t) + [(N - a M)/b] e^{-a t} sin(b t).

This would help in quickly finding the inverse transform for similar functions without having to rederive it each time.

To evaluate the inverse Laplace transform of \( F(s) = \frac{2s + 4}{s^2 + 2s + 5} \), we first complete the square in the denominator:

\[
s^2 + 2s + 5 = (s+1)^2 + 4.
\]

Thus, \( F(s) \) becomes:

\[
F(s) = \frac{2s + 4}{(s+1)^2 + 4}.
\]

Next, we rewrite the numerator \( 2s + 4 \) as \( 2(s+1) + 2 \), so:

\[
F(s) = \frac{2(s+1) + 2}{(s+1)^2 + 4}.
\]

This allows us to split \( F(s) \) into two simpler fractions:

\[
F(s) = \frac{2(s+1)}{(s+1)^2 + 4} + \frac{2}{(s+1)^2 + 4}.
\]

Using standard Laplace transform pairs:

1. \( \mathcal{L}^{-1} \left\{ \frac{s+a}{(s+a)^2 + b^2} \right\} = e^{-at} \cos(bt), \)
2. \( \mathcal{L}^{-1} \left\{ \frac{b}{(s+a)^2 + b^2} \right\} = e^{-at} \sin(bt). \)

For the first term, \( \frac{2(s+1)}{(s+1)^2 + 4} \), we identify \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 2 \). This corresponds to:

\[
2e^{-t} \cos(2t).
\]

For the second term, \( \frac{2}{(s+1)^2 + 4} \), we factor out \( b = 2 \), so:

\[
\frac{2}{(s+1)^2 + 4} = \frac{2}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{(s+1)^2 + 4} = e^{-t} \sin(2t).
\]

Combining these results, the inverse Laplace transform of \( F(s) \) is:

\[
f(t) = 2e^{-t} \cos(2t) + e^{-t} \sin(2t).
\]

This matches **Option I**.

For the generalized Laplace transform pair, consider \( F(s) = \frac{Ms + N}{(s+a)^2 + b^2} \). By splitting the numerator as \( Ms + N = M(s+a) + (N - aM) \), we can write:

\[
F(s) = \frac{M(s+a)}{(s+a)^2 + b^2} + \frac{N - aM}{(s+a)^2 + b^2}.
\]

The inverse Laplace transform is:

\[
\mathcal{L}^{-1} \left\{ \frac{Ms + N}{(s+a)^2 + b^2} \right\} = M e^{-at} \cos(bt) + \frac{N - aM}{b} e^{-at} \sin(bt).
\]

This generalized pair can be added to a Laplace transform table to handle similar functions.
