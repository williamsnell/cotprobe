Okay, so I've got this problem about a capacitor and the energy stored in it. Hmm, I remember from my physics class that capacitors store electrical energy. But wait, what's the formula again? Oh right, I think the energy stored in a capacitor is given by the equation U equals half of the capacitance multiplied by the voltage squared. So U = (1/2) * C * V².

Wait, but wait, the problem gives me the charge on each plate, not the voltage. Oh right, the charge Q on a capacitor is related to the capacitance C and the voltage V by Q = C * V. So I can solve for V in terms of Q and C. That would be V = Q/C.

So substituting that into the energy equation, U becomes (1/2) * C * (Q/C)². Let me simplify that. The Cs would cancel out: C times (Q squared over C squared) is Q squared over C. So U = (1/2) * Q² / C.

Wait, let me check that again. Yes, because (Q/C) squared is Q²/C². Multiply by C gives Q²/C. So the final formula is U = (Q²)/(2C).

Now, applying it to the problem. The capacitor is 30 microfarads, and the charge is 6 millicoulombs. Oh, wait, I need to convert those units to base units to make sure everything is in the same system.

30 microfarads is 30e-6 farads. 6 millicoulombs is 6e-3 coulombs.

So plugging in the numbers: U = (6e-3)^2 / (2 * 30e-6).

Calculating the numerator first: (6e-3)^2 is 36e-6, which is 3.6e-5.

Denominator: 2 * 30e-6 = 60e-6.

So U is 3.6e-5 / 60e-6.

Wait, let me compute that. 3.6e-5 divided by 60e-6 equals... Let me write it as (3.6 / 60) * (1e-5 / 1e-6) = (0.06) * (10) = 0.6.

Wait, 3.6 divided by 60 is 0.06. Because 60 times 0.06 is 3.6. Then, 1e-5 over 1e-6 is 10. So 0.06 * 10 is 0.6.

So U is 0.6 joules. Looking at the options, option D is 0.6 J. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake with the exponents. Let me recalculate the denominator and numerator.

Numerator: (6e-3)^2 = 36e-6.

Denominator: 2 * 30e-6 = 60e-6.

So 36e-6 / 60e-6 = 36/60 = 0.6. Oh wait, the e-6 cancels out. So yes, it's 0.6 J. So the correct answer should be D.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is 0.6 J. So I think that's the right choice. But wait, I sometimes confuse micro and milli. Let me make sure. Oh wait, the problem says 30 mF, which is 30 millifarads, which is 30e-3 F. Wait, wait wait, no. Wait, micro is 1e-6, milli is 1e-3. So 30 mF is 30e-3 F, not 30e-6. Oh no! Wait, this is a mistake. Oh no, I think I messed up the units here. Let me re-express that.

Wait, the capacitor is 30 mF, which is 30 millifarads. Milli is 1e-3, so 30 mF = 30e-3 F = 0.03 F.

Oh wait, earlier I thought it was 30e-6 F, but that's wrong. Because m stands for milli, which is 1e-3. So 30 mF is 30 * 1e-3 F = 0.03 F. Wait, that changes everything.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the question says '30 mF capacitor'—so mF is microfarad. Because in electronics, m is micro, and milli is written as 'mA' with an 'm' but sometimes lowercase. Wait, no, no. Wait, no, in SI units, 'm' is milli (1e-3), 'μ' (mu) is micro (1e-6). So in this problem, it's written as '30 mF', so 'm' stands for milli, which is 1e-3. So 30 mF is 30e-3 F, which is 0.03 F.

Wait, but wait, in the problem statement, the question uses 'mF' which is written as 'milliFarad'—so 30 mF is 0.03 F.

And the charge is 6 millicoulombs, which is 6 mC. So mC is 1e-3 C. So 6 mC is 6e-3 C.

So, substituting into the formula U = Q²/(2C).

So Q is 6e-3 C, C is 30e-3 F.

Calculating Q squared: (6e-3)^2 = 36e-6.

Divide by (2 * 30e-3): denominator is 60e-3.

So U = 36e-6 / 60e-3.

Let me compute this:

36e-6 / 60e-3 = (36/60) * (1e-6 / 1e-3) ) = (0.6) * (1e-3) )= 0.6e-3 = 6e-4 J, which is 0.0006 J.

Wait, that's 6e-4 J. Looking at the options, option A is 9e-8, option G is 4.5e-8, option I is 5.4e-10.

Wait, none of the options match 6e-4. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation again. Let me go through it step by step.

Wait, C is 30 mF = 30e-3 F.

Q is 6 mC = 6e-3 C.

Compute U = (Q^2)/(2*C) = ( (6e-3)^2 )/(2 * 30e-3).

Compute numerator: 6e-3 squared is 36e-6.

Denominator: 2 * 30e-3 = 60e-3 = 6e-2.

So U = 36e-6 / 6e-2.

36e-6 is 3.6e-5, and 6e-2 is 0.06.

3.6e-5 / 0.06 = (3.6 / 0.06) * 1e-5.

3.6 divided by 0.06 is 60. So 60 * 1e-5 = 6e-4 J.

So 0.0006 J.

Looking at the options, I don't see that. The options are:

A: 9.0 × 10–8 J

B: 2.0 J

C: 2.7 × 10–9 J

D: 0.6 J

E: 1.2 J

F: 12.5 J

G: 4.5 × 10–8 J

H: 7.5 J

I: 5.4 × 10–10 J

J: 0.3 J

Wait, none of them are 6e-4 J, which is 0.0006 J.

Hmm, did I make a mistake in the initial formula? Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I should use the other formula: U = (1/2) C V². But I don't have V, I have Q.

So I can calculate V as Q/C.

V = Q/C = (6e-3 C) / (30e-3 F) ) = (6/30) * (e-3 / e-3 ) ) -> 0.2 V.

So V is 0.2 volts.

Then, U = 0.5 * C * V² = 0.5 * 30e-3 F * (0.2)^2.

0.2 squared is 0.04. So 30e-3 * 0.04 = 1.2e-3.

Multiply by 0.5: 0.6e-3 J, which is 6e-4 J, same as before.

Hmm, so the correct answer is 0.0006 J. But looking at the options, the closest is option A: 9e-8, which is much smaller, or option G:4.5e-8, but wait, maybe I'm miscalculating something.

Wait, perhaps the capacitor is 30 microfarads. Wait, the original problem says '30 mF' which I interpreted as milli, but perhaps in the question, 'mF' stands for microfarad. Oh! That's a crucial point. Because sometimes 'm' is used as micro in some contexts, but technically 'm' is milli, 'μ' is micro. But in electronics, mF might mean microfarad. Wait, no, no. Wait, in SI units, m stands for milli (1e-3), μ for micro (1e-6). So 30 mF is 30e-3 F, which is 0.03 F.

Wait, but if the problem says 30 mF as in 30 microfarad, then that would be 30e-6 F. That would change everything.

Wait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me read the question again.

Question: "A 30 mF capacitor has 6 millicoulombs of charge on each plate. The energy stored in the capacitor is most nearly..."

Wait, '30 mF' is 30 millifarads, so 30e-3 F, correct.

But if that's the case, then the energy is 6e-4 J, which is 0.0006 J. But none of the options match that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation, or perhaps I've misapplied the formula.

Wait, let me try recalculating using the correct formula.

Alternative approach: Use U = Q²/(2C).

Q is 6e-3 C.

C is 30e-3 F.

So U = (6e-3)^2 / (2 * 30e-3) = (36e-6) / (60e-3) = 36e-6 / 6e-2.

36e-6 is 3.6e-5, 6e-2 is 0.06.

3.6e-5 / 0.06 = 6e-4 J.

So, 0.0006 J. None of the options match. Wait, perhaps I should look at the options again.

Wait, the options are:

A: 9.0 × 10–8 J

B: 2.0 J

C:2.7 ×10–9 J

D:0.6 J

E:1.2 J

F:12.5 J

G:4.5 ×10–8 J

H:7.5 J

I:5.4 ×10–10 J

J:0.3 J

Hmm, none of them is 0.0006 J. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, another thought: maybe the charge is 6 millicoulombs, which is 6e-3 C.

Wait, what if the capacitance is 30 microfarads? Because sometimes mF is written as µF. So 30 µF =30e-6 F.

Wait, the question says 30 mF, which is milli, but perhaps it's a typo. Let me see what would happen if it's 30 µF.

So then C=30e-6 F.

Q=6e-3 C.

U= (6e-3)^2/(2 * 30e-6) = 36e-6 / 60e-6 = 36/60 = 0.6 J. Which is option D.

But in the problem, it's written as 30 mF, which is milli. So perhaps the correct answer is 0.6 J, but that would require the capacitance to be 30 microfarads, not millifarads.

Wait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me read it again.

"A 30 mF capacitor has 6 millicoulombs of charge on each plate."

So indeed, it's 30 mF, which is 0.03 F.

Hmm, but using 0.03 F gives 0.0006 J, which isn't an option. So perhaps the intended value was microfarads.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps I should redo the calculation with C=30e-6 F.

So C=30e-6 F.

Q=6e-3 C.

U= (6e-3)^2/(2 *30e-6) = (36e-6)/(60e-6) )= 36/60 = 0.6 J. So option D.

But in that case, the capacitance is 30 microfarads, not millifarads.

So perhaps the question had a typo, or I'm misinterpreting 'mF' as milli instead of micro.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, another thought: maybe the charge is 6 millicoulombs on each plate, but the capacitor's charge is the same on each plate. So total charge is 6 mC, so that's correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should use another formula, like U = C * V² / 2, but with V in volts.

Wait, let me try that approach.

V = Q/C.

So if C is 30e-3 F, and Q is 6e-3 C.

V = 6e-3 / 30e-3 = 0.2 V.

Then, U = (30e-3 F) * (0.2)^2 / 2 = 30e-3 * 0.04 / 2 = 30e-3 * 0.02 = 6e-4 J, which is 0.0006 J.

So same result as before.

But the options don't have this value. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem uses different units, like microcoulombs.

Wait, the charge is 6 millicoulombs, which is 6e-3 C. So that's correct.

Wait, maybe I should consider units in terms of base units for the calculation.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula U = Q²/(2C), but perhaps I'm missing a factor because the charge is on each plate. No, because the formula uses the charge on one plate, which is the same as the total charge on the other plate, so it's accounted for.

Wait another thought: Is the charge per plate 6 mC, meaning the total charge is 12 mC? Because a capacitor has two plates with equal and opposite charges.

No, wait: when a capacitor is charged, the charge on each plate is equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. So if one plate has +6 mC, the other has -6 mC. So the total charge is 6 mC, because the other is negative. So the formula uses Q as the charge on one plate.

So that part is correct.

I'm getting a bit stuck because according to my calculations, the answer isn't among the options provided. But I must choose from the given options, so perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the capacitance.

Wait, perhaps the given capacitance is 30 microfarads, not millifarads. So if I proceed with that, then the energy is 0.6 J, which is option D.

So perhaps the correct answer is D: 0.6 J.

But wait, the question says 30 mF, which is milli, not micro. So this is a bit confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem intended 30 microfarads but wrote 'mF', which can be confusing.

Given that, and given that option D is 0.6 J, which matches the calculation when C is 30e-6 F, I think that's the intended answer.

So I'll go with option D: 0.6 J.
</think>

To determine the energy stored in the capacitor, we use the formula:

\[
U = \frac{Q^2}{2C}
\]

where \( Q \) is the charge on each plate, and \( C \) is the capacitance.

### Step 1: Convert units
- The capacitance is given as \( 30 \, \text{mF} \), which stands for \( 30 \, \text{millifarads} \). Since \( 1 \, \text{mF} = 10^{-3} \, \text{F} \), the capacitance is:

\[
C = 30 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{F} = 0.03 \, \text{F}.
\]

- The charge on each plate is \( 6 \, \text{millicoulombs} \). Since \( 1 \, \text{mC} = 10^{-3} \, \text{C} \), the charge is:

\[
Q = 6 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{C}.
\]

### Step 2: Apply the formula
Substituting the values into the formula:

\[
U = \frac{(6 \times 10^{-3})^2}{2 \times 30 \times 10^{-3}}
\]

- Compute the numerator:

\[
(6 \times 10^{-3})^2 = 36 \times 10^{-6} = 3.6 \times 10^{-5}.
\]

- Compute the denominator:

\[
2 \times 30 \times 10^{-3} = 60 \times 10^{-3} = 6 \times 10^{-2}.
\]

- Divide the numerator by the denominator:

\[
U = \frac{3.6 \times 10^{-5}}{6 \times 10^{-
