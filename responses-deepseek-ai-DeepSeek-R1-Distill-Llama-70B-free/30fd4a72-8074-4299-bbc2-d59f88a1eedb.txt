Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about individual freedom to schedule work. Hmm, let's see. I'm a bit rusty on some of these HR terms, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking of what individual freedom to schedule work is an example. The options are from A to J, each representing different job-related concepts. 

First, I need to understand what each option means because some of these terms are similar. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: Job design. I remember job design is about how a job is structured, including tasks, responsibilities, and how work is performed. It can influence things like job satisfaction and efficiency. So, if a job is designed in a way that allows flexibility, that might relate to scheduling freedom.

Option B: Job planning. That sounds like the process of organizing tasks and setting goals for a job. Maybe it's about how someone plans their work, but not sure if it's directly about scheduling freedom.

Option C: Job specification. That's more about the requirements for a job, like skills, qualifications, and duties. Doesn't seem directly related to scheduling.

Option D: Job satisfaction. This is about how content an employee is with their job. Satisfied employees might have more flexibility, but the question is about scheduling freedom being an example of something, not the other way around.

Option E: Job rate. I think that refers to the pay rate or how much someone is paid per hour or piece. Not related to scheduling.

Option F: Job security. That's about how stable the job is, whether the employee feels safe from being laid off. Not about scheduling.

Option G: Job enrichment. Oh right, job enrichment is about adding more depth and complexity to a job to make it more rewarding. It often involves giving employees more autonomy, like allowing them to schedule their work or make decisions. So this seems relevant.

Option H: Job analysis. That's the process of studying a job to determine its tasks, duties, and requirements. More about understanding the job than about scheduling.

Option I: Job evaluation. This is assessing the value of a job to determine pay and grading. Not directly about scheduling.

Option J: Job rotation. That's where employees move between different jobs to gain experience. It's more about variety than scheduling freedom.

So putting it together, the question is about scheduling work, which relates to having more control over one's work. Job enrichment is about making jobs more engaging by adding responsibilities, including more autonomy. So individual freedom to schedule work would be an example of job enrichment.

Wait, but I should double-check. Job design also involves structuring the job, which could include flexible scheduling. But I think job enrichment is more about enhancing the job's motivational aspects, which includes giving more freedom in how work is done, including scheduling.

Alternatively, job design might include aspects like telecommuting or flexible hours, so could that be it? Hmm. Or maybe it's about the structure of the job, which includes how it's scheduled.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Job enrichment is about vertical expansion, adding more tasks that give a sense of completion, like allowing an employee to plan and schedule their work. So that would fit.

Yes, I think the correct answer is G: Job enrichment.

The question asks about individual freedom to schedule work as an example of a specific concept. After evaluating each option:

- **Job design** (A) involves structuring tasks and responsibilities but isn't specifically about scheduling freedom.
- **Job enrichment** (G) focuses on enhancing job engagement by adding autonomy, which aligns with scheduling freedom.
- Other options like job planning, job specification, job satisfaction, etc., don't directly relate to scheduling autonomy.

Thus, individual freedom to schedule work is best exemplified by **job enrichment**.

Answer: G
