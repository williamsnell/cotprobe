Question:

 If it were known that a policy would wipe out several animal species without negatively affecting human beings, Baxter would most likely say that

Options:

A: this policy is morally problematic because it disrupts the natural order.
B: this policy is morally problematic because it negatively impacts biodiversity.
C: this policy is morally acceptable because it does not harm human beings.
D: this policy is morally unproblematic.
E: this policy is morally obligatory because it prioritizes human beings.
F: this policy is morally unacceptable because it eliminates several animal species.
G: this policy is morally obligatory because the environment ought not to exist.
H: this policy is morally problematic because it damages the integrity of the ecosystem.
I: this policy is morally problematic because it harms the environment.

Okay, so I've got this question about Baxter's view on a policy that would wipe out several animal species but wouldn't harm humans. I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think through it carefully.

First, I remember that Baxter is associated with a certain ethical theory. I think he's a human-centered ethicist, maybe a form of anthropocentrism. So, his main concern would be the impact on humans rather than other species or the environment itself.

The question is about whether the policy is morally problematic. The policy wipes out species but doesn't negatively affect humans. So, from Baxter's perspective, if humans aren't harmed, the policy might not be an issue.

Looking at the options. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A says it's problematic because it disrupts the natural order. I'm not sure if Baxter would care about the natural order for its own sake. His focus is more on humans, so maybe not.

Option B says it's problematic because it impacts biodiversity. Again, if Baxter is human-centered, biodiversity might not be his main concern unless it affects humans. Since the question states humans aren't negatively affected, B might not be the choice.

Option C says it's acceptable because it doesn't harm humans. That aligns with what I was thinking. If humans aren't harmed, Baxter would likely say it's acceptable.

Option D says it's unproblematic. That's a bit vague, but similar to C. It might depend on the reasoning. If the policy doesn't harm humans, then Baxter might see it as unproblematic.

Option E says it's morally obligatory because it prioritizes humans. Obligatory seems strong. Maybe Baxter wouldn't go that far; he might just say it's acceptable, not that we're obliged to do it.

Option F says it's unacceptable because it eliminates species. That's the opposite of what I think Baxter would say, so probably not.

Options G, H, I focus on the environment, ecosystems, etc. Baxter probably wouldn't prioritize those aspects, so these options are less likely.

So, narrowing it down, the key is that Baxter doesn't see harm to non-humans as a moral issue if humans aren't affected. So the policy wouldn't be problematic. So between C and D.

Option C says "morally acceptable because it does not harm human beings." Option D says "morally unproblematic." Both are similar, but in the context, the question is whether the policy is problematic. If it's not problematic, then D might be the answer. But C directly addresses why: because it doesn't harm humans.

Wait, the question is phrased as "Baxter would most likely say that..." So, what would Baxter's stance be? If the policy doesn't affect humans, Baxter would likely say it's morally acceptable, so C. Or maybe he would say it's not morally problematic, which is D.

Hmm. So the options are about what Baxter would say. Baxter's position is that only effects on humans matter morally. So the policy doesn't harm humans, so it's not morally problematic. Therefore, the answer would be D: morally unproblematic.

Wait, but option C says it's acceptable because it doesn't harm humans. So both C and D are possible. But the question is, would he say it's acceptable or unproblematic? I think in ethical terms, if something doesn't cause moral problems, it's unproblematic. So D might be the better fit.

Alternatively, if the question is about whether the policy is acceptable, then C would be the choice. But the question is whether the policy is "morally problematic." So if it's not problematic, then D would be correct.

Wait, the options: the question is "Baxter would most likely say that..." and the options start with "this policy is..." So, the correct answer is that Baxter would say it's not morally problematic because it doesn't affect humans. So D says "morally unproblematic," which is the same as saying it's not problematic.

So I think the answer is D.

The question revolves around Baxter's ethical stance, which is human-centered (anthropocentric). Baxter's primary concern is the impact of actions on human beings, not on non-human species or the environment. The policy in question wipes out several animal species but does not negatively affect humans. Given this, Baxter would likely view the policy as morally unproblematic because it does not harm humans.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, F, G, H, I**: These focus on biodiversity, natural order, ecosystems, or environmental harm, which Baxter is unlikely to prioritize over human interests.
- **C**: Suggests the policy is morally acceptable because it does not harm humans. While this aligns with Baxter's human-centered approach, the question specifically asks whether the policy is "morally problematic."
- **D**: States the policy is "morally unproblematic," which directly addresses the lack of moral concern for Baxter since humans are unaffected.

Since the question asks whether the policy is "morally problematic," and Baxter would not see it as such if humans are unaffected, the most accurate answer is **D**.

Answer: D
