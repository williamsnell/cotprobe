Okay, so I have this problem where I need to order the numbers 6, −1, 8, −3, −4 from least to greatest. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this. 

First, I remember that when arranging numbers from least to greatest, I should start with the smallest number and move to the largest. So I need to figure out which is the smallest among these and then go up from there.

Looking at the numbers: 6, -1, 8, -3, -4. I see that there are both positive and negative numbers here. Negative numbers are always smaller than positive ones, so I can ignore the positives for a moment and focus on the negatives first.

The negatives are -1, -3, and -4. Now, when comparing negative numbers, the one with the larger absolute value is actually the smaller number. For example, -4 is smaller than -3 because it's further to the left on the number line.

So arranging the negatives: -4 is the smallest, then comes -3, and then -1. So the order so far is -4, -3, -1.

Now the positives are 6 and 8. Obviously, 6 comes before 8 because it's smaller.

Putting it all together, the order from least to greatest should be: -4, -3, -1, 6, 8.

Now let's look at the options given to find which one matches this sequence.

Option A: -4, 8, -1, -3, 6 → No, that's not right because 8 is too big to be second.

Option B: -4, -3, -1, 6, 8 → Yes, this matches what I thought.

Option C: 6, -1, 8, -3, -4 → No, starts with 6 which is positive, so definitely not.

Option D: -4, -1, -3, 6, 8 → No, because -1 comes before -3 here, which is incorrect.

Option E: -1, 6, -3, -4, 8 → No, starts with -1, which isn't the smallest.

Option F: -3, -4, -1, 8, 6 → No, the negatives are in the wrong order.

Option G: -1, -3, -4, 6, 8 → No, starts with -1.

Option H: -3, -4, 6, -1, 8 → No, wrong order.

Option I: 6, 8, -1, -3, -4 → No, starts with positives.

Option J: 8, 6, -1, -3, -4 → No, starts with the largest positive.

So the correct option is B.

The correct order from least to greatest is −4, −3, −1, 6, 8. This matches option B.

Answer: B
