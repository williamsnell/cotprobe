Okay, so I've got this question about Truth-In-Lending regulations. Hmm, I remember that these regulations require lenders to disclose certain terms clearly, like the annual interest rate. The question is asking about a retailer who charges 1 and a half percent interest per month. I need to find the annual rate they must indicate.

Wait, the retailer charges 1.5% each month on the unpaid balance. So I think to get the annual rate, I should calculate how much that monthly rate adds up over a year. Since there are 12 months, I guess I can multiply 1.5% by 12. Let me do that calculation. 1.5 times 12 equals 18. So the annual interest rate would be 18%.

But wait, is there anything else I need to consider? Like, does compounding come into play here? Because if it's compounding, the effective annual rate would be higher. Oh, but Truth-In-Lending, I think, usually requires the nominal annual rate, not the effective. So maybe I don't have to adjust for compounding.

So each month, the interest is calculated on the unpaid balance, which includes previous interest, so it's compounding in a way. But wait, the question is about what the retailer must indicate, which is the annual rate. If it's 1.5% per month, then the nominal APR is just 1.5% *12 = 18%. So the answer should be 18%, which is option I.

I don't think I'm missing anything here. So the correct answer should be I: 18%.

The correct answer is I: 18%.

Step-by-step explanation:
1. The retailer charges 1.5% interest per month.
2. To find the annual rate, multiply the monthly rate by 12: 1.5% Ã— 12 = 18%.
3. Truth-In-Lending requires the nominal annual rate, so compounding isn't considered here.
