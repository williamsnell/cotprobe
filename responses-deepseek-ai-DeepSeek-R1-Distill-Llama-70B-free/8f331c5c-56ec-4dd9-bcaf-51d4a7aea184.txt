Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the units digit of 7^25. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with units digits, especially for exponents, there's a pattern that repeats every certain number of powers. So I think I should look for a cycle or pattern in the units digits of powers of 7.

Let me start by calculating the units digits of the first few powers of 7 to see if I can spot a pattern.

First, 7^1 is 7. So the units digit is 7.

7^2 is 49. So the units digit is 9.

7^3 is 343. Units digit is 3.

7^4 is 2401. Units digit is 1.

7^5 would be 7^4 multiplied by 7, so 1 *7 is 7. So units digit is 7 again.

Wait, that looks familiar. So the units digits are cycling every four exponents: 7, 9, 3, 1, and then back to 7 again.

So the cycle is 7,9,3,1 and repeats every 4. That means the pattern length is 4.

Now, since the cycle repeats every 4, I can find where 25 falls in this cycle. To do that, I can divide 25 by 4 and find the remainder.

25 divided by 4 is 6 with a remainder of 1. Because 4*6=24, and 25-24=1.

So the remainder is 1. That means 7^25 has the same units digit as 7^1, which is 7. Wait, but let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here.

Wait, let me recount. The cycle starts at exponent 1. So exponent 1: first position in the cycle, which is 7. Exponent 2: second position, 9. Exponent 3: third position, 3. Exponent 4: fourth position, 1. Then exponent 5: back to first position, 7.

So the positions are 1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4,... So for any exponent n, the position in the cycle is (n mod 4). But wait, if n mod 4 is zero, that would correspond to the 4th position.

Wait, let's think. For n=1: 1 mod4=1 → position1=7. Correct.

n=2: 2 mod4=2 → position2=9. Correct.

n=3: 3 mod4=3 → position3=3. Correct.

n=4: 4 mod4=0 → but in the cycle, that's the fourth position, which is 1. So when the remainder is 0, it's the 4th position.

So now, for n=25, 25 divided by 4 is 6 remainder 1. So 25 mod4 is 1. So that's the first position in the cycle, which is 7.

So the units digit is 7. But wait, let me check: 7^5 is 16807, units digit 7. 7^6 would be 7^5 *7= 16807 *7= 117649 → units digit 9. So yeah, the cycle continues.

So 7^25's units digit should be 7. Let me look back at the options. Option G is 7. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I'm not making a mistake with the exponent. Because sometimes when I count the remainder, I might get confused whether it's 0 or not. Let me list out more exponents to check.

n: units digit.

1:7

2:9

3:3

4:1

5:7

6:9

7:3

8:1

9:7

10:9

11:3

12:1

13:7

14:9

15:3

16:1

17:7

18:9

19:3

20:1

21:7

22:9

23:3

24:1

25:7.

Yes, that's correct. So 7^25 has units digit 7. So the answer is G.

To determine the units digit of \(7^{25}\), we observe the pattern in the units digits of powers of 7:

\[
\begin{align*}
7^1 & = 7 \quad \text{(units digit: 7)} \\
7^2 & = 49 \quad \text{(units digit: 9)} \\
7^3 & = 343 \quad \text{(units digit: 3)} \\
7^4 & = 2401 \quad \text{(units digit: 1)} \\
7^5 & = 16807 \quad \text{(units digit: 7)} \\
\end{align*}
\]

The units digits repeat every 4 exponents: \(7, 9, 3, 1\). To find the position of \(7^{25}\) in this cycle, we calculate the remainder of \(25\) divided by \(4\):

\[
25 \div 4 = 6 \text{ remainder } 1.
\]

This means \(7^{25}\) corresponds to the first position in the cycle, which has a units digit of \(7\).

Thus, the units digit of \(7^{25}\) is \(7\).
