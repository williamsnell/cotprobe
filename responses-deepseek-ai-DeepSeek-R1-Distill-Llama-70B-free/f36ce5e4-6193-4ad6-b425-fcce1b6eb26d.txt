Okay, so I'm trying to solve this problem about the Fizeau toothed-wheel experiment to find the velocity of light. Hmm, I remember that Fizeau's experiment involved measuring the speed of light using a rotating wheel with teeth. The basic idea is that when the wheel spins, light passes through the teeth and reflects off a mirror. Depending on the speed of the wheel, the light might or might not pass through the next tooth when it returns.

The question has two parts, (a) and (b). Let's start with part (a). The problem states that the eclipse (when the light is blocked) is first observed at 1500 rpm. The wheel has 600 teeth, and the distance to the mirror is 4980 meters. I need to find the velocity of light from this.

Wait, I think the formula for the speed of light in this experiment is c = (n * d * N) / (2 * t), but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula. Let me think again. Oh right, the time taken for the light to go to the mirror and come back is the same as the time it takes for the wheel to rotate by one tooth's position. So, the time t is the time for one tooth to pass a point, which is the period of rotation.

So the speed of the wheel is related to how fast it's rotating. The rotational speed is given in rpm, revolutions per minute. So 1500 rpm means 1500 revolutions per minute. Each revolution has 600 teeth, so each tooth is at an angle of 360 degrees divided by 600, which is 0.6 degrees per tooth.

Wait, no, maybe I should think in terms of time per tooth. If the wheel makes 1500 revolutions per minute, then per revolution it takes 60/(1500) seconds. So time per tooth is (60 / 1500) / 600 seconds. Because each revolution brings 600 teeth past, so each tooth is 1/600 of a revolution.

Wait, no, time per tooth (the period) is (60 s / rpm) divided by number of teeth. So for 1500 rpm, period per tooth T would be (60 / 1500) / 600 = (0.04) / 600 = 0.0000666667 seconds per tooth. Wait, that seems really small. Let me calculate that again.

60 seconds divided by 1500 rpm is 0.04 seconds per revolution. Since each revolution has 600 teeth, each tooth takes 0.04 / 600 = 6.666...e-5 seconds. So T is 6.666e-5 seconds.

Now, the time for light to go to the mirror and back is 2d/c. Wait, because the light travels distance d to the mirror and d back, so total 2d. So the time is (2d)/c.

This time has to equal the time it takes for the wheel to rotate by one tooth, which is T. Because when the wheel rotates one tooth, the next tooth is in place, so if the light returns in that time, it would pass through. But wait, in the eclipse condition, the light is blocked when the wheel has rotated just enough that the next tooth is in the way. So maybe the time for the light to make the round trip is equal to the time for the wheel to rotate by one tooth. So 2d/c = T.

So rearranging, c = 2d / T.

Wait, let's plug in the numbers. d is 4980 meters. T is 6.666e-5 seconds.

So c = 2 * 4980 / (6.666e-5) = (9960) / 6.666e-5.

Let me compute that. 9960 divided by 0.00006666. Hmm.

Wait, 6.666e-5 is approximately 6.6666667e-5. Let me do the calculation:

9960 / 6.6666667e-5 = 9960 / 0.00006666667.

Let me compute this step by step. 0.00006666667 is 6.666667e-5.

So 9960 divided by 6.666667e-5 equals approximately 9960 * (1e5/6.666667) ) = 9960 * (1e5)/(20/3) ) because 6.666667 is 20/3.

Wait, 20/3 is approximately 6.666667. So 1e5 divided by (20/3) is 1e5 * 3 /20 = (3e5)/20 = 15,000.

So 9960 * 15,000 = ?

Wait, 9960 * 15,000 = 9960 * 1.5e4 = 9960 *1.5 * 1e4.

9960 *1.5 is 14,940. So 14,940 *1e4 = 1.494e8 m/s.

Wait, but the speed of light is known to be approximately 3.00e8 m/s. Wait, this is giving me about 1.5e8, which is half. Did I make a mistake in the formula?

Ah, wait a second. Because in the Fizeau method, the formula is c = (2d * N) / (n * t), but I might have gotten something wrong. Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider that the time for the light's round trip equals the time for the wheel to turn by one tooth, so T = 2d / c.

Wait no, the way I did it earlier was correct. So c = 2d / T.

Wait, perhaps I made a computational error. Let me recalculate 9960 divided by 6.6666667e-5.

Compute 9960 / 0.00006666667.

Let me compute 9960 / 0.00006666667.

Well, 0.00006666667 is 6.666667e-5.

So 9960 / 6.666667e-5 = 9960 * (1 / 6.666667e-5 )

1 / 6.666667e-5 is approximately 15,000.

So 9960 *15,000 = let's compute 9960 *15,000.

9960 *10,000 = 99,600,000.

9960 *5,000= 49,800,000.

So total is 99.6e6 +49.8e6= 149.4e6 m/s. So 1.494e8 m/s.

Wait, but the known speed of light is about 3e8 m/s. So why am I getting half of that?

Ah, maybe the distance is one way. Because in Fizeau's experiment, the light goes through the wheel, reflects off a mirror, and comes back. So the total path is 2d. Therefore, the time is 2d/c. Wait, but I think I accounted for that correctly.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Another approach: the number of teeth passing per second is N (rpm converted to per second) times the number of teeth. So 1500 rpm is 1500/60 =25 revolutions per second. Each revolution has 600 teeth, so 25 *600 =15,000 teeth per second.

So the time between two consecutive teeth is 1/15,000 seconds per tooth, which is approximately 6.6667e-5 seconds, same as before.

So the time for light to go to mirror and back is 2d/c. And this equals the time the wheel takes to rotate by one tooth, which is 1/15,000 s.

So 2d/c = 1/(15000) → c= 2d *15000.

Wait, let me double-check.

Wait no, 2d/c = T. T is 1/(number of teeth per second). Because each tooth passes at a time interval of T.

So number of teeth per second is 1500 rpm *600 teeth per revolution /60 = (1500 *600)/60 = 1500 *10 =15,000 teeth per second.

So T=1/(15,000) = 6.6667e-5 s.

So 2d/c = T → c= 2d/(T).

Wait, yes. So 2d is 2*4980=9960 m.

T is 6.6667e-5 s.

So c=9960 /6.6667e-5 = 9960 / 0.000066667.

Calculating that: 9960 / 0.000066667 = 9960 * (1/0.000066667) ≈ 9960 * 15000.

Wait, 1/0.000066667 is 15,000 as before.

So 9960 *15,000 = 149,400,000 m/s → 1.494e8 m/s.

Hmm. But wait, the actual speed of light is 3e8 m/s. So why am I getting half? Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, perhaps I have the formula wrong. Let me think about the Fizeau experiment again. Oh wait! In Fizeau's method, the formula is c = (2dN)/n, where N is the number of revolutions per second, and n is the number of teeth. Wait, maybe I should double-check the exact formula.

Another approach: The time for the light to make the round trip is Δt = 2d/c.

In that same time, the wheel must turn by an angle corresponding to one tooth gap. The wheel has 600 teeth, so each tooth corresponds to 1/600 of a revolution. The number of revolutions per second is N = 1500 rpm /60 = 25 rev/s.

So the time to rotate by one tooth is Δt = 1/(N * number of teeth) )= 1/(25 *600) = 1/15000 ≈6.6667e-5 s.

So 2d/c = 1/(25*600) → c = 2d *25 *600.

Wait, that's different. So 2*4980 *25 *600.

Wait, that makes more sense. Let me compute that.

Wait, 2*4980 =9960.

25 *600 =15,000.

So 9960 *15,000 = 9960 *1.5e4 = (9960 *1.5) *1e4.

9960 *1.5 is 14,940. So 14,940e4 →1.494e8 m/s.

Wait, same result. Hmm. But the known speed of light is 3e8. So I must have made a mistake in the formula. Maybe I should check the correct formula for Fizeau's experiment.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula is c = (d * ω * N) / (2π), where ω is the angular velocity in radians per second, N the number of teeth, and d the distance.

Wait, but this approach might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I should look up the correct formula.

Wait, I recall that in Fizeau's experiment, the condition for an eclipse (when the light is blocked) is when the wheel has rotated by one tooth during the time the light takes for the round trip. So the time for the light is t = 2d/c. The wheel's rotational speed is such that in that time, it has turned by an angle θ corresponding to one tooth.

The rotational speed ω is in radians per second. The angle between two adjacent teeth is θ=2π/N_teeth radians. So θ=2π/600.

The time t is θ/ω. So t= (2π/600)/ω.

But t is also 2d/c. So equate the two:

2d/c = (2π)/(600 ω).

Solving for c:

c = (2d *600 ω)/(2π) )= (600 d ω)/π.

Now, ω is the angular velocity. The disk is rotating at 1500 rpm. Convert that to rad/s:

1500 rpm =1500 * 2π radians per minute.

Convert to per second: 1500 *2π /60 =25 * 2π =50π rad/s.

So ω=50 π rad/s.

Now, plug into c:

c= (600 * d * 50 π ) / π.

The π cancels out.

c=600 * d *50.

d is 4980 meters.

So c=600 * 4980 *50.

Wait, let me compute that.

600 *50 =30,000.

30,000 *4980 = ?

Well, 30,000 *5000 would be 150,000,000, but since it's 4980, it's 150,000,000 - (30,000 *20) =150,000,000 -600,000=149,400,000 m/s →1.494e8 m/s.

Same result again. But this is about half of the known speed of light, which is 3e8 m/s. So where am I going wrong?

Wait, perhaps the formula should have 2d instead of d? Because the light goes to the mirror and back, so the distance is 2d. Oh wait, in the earlier approach, I think I used 2d. Let me check.

Wait, in the first approach, I had c=2d / T. T being the time per tooth. Which gave me 1.494e8 m/s.

But in the second approach using angular velocity, I end up with the same number.

So perhaps the initial approach was correct, but the value is not matching the known speed. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in converting rpm to rad/s. Wait, 1500 rpm is 1500 revolutions per minute. Each revolution is 2π radians. So per minute, it's 1500 * 2π radians. Per second, it's 1500 *2π /60 = (1500/60)*2π=25 *2π=50π rad/s. So that part is correct.

Hmm, perhaps the problem is that the eclipse occurs when the light returns when a tooth is in the same position, meaning that the wheel has rotated by an integer number of teeth. But I'm getting confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps I missed a factor of 2 somewhere else. Let me re-examine the formula.

Wait, another way to think: the number of teeth that pass during the light's round trip is c/(2d) * (number of teeth per second). And for the eclipse, this number must be an integer, right?

Wait, when the light goes and comes back, the wheel has rotated by some teeth. For the eclipse, when the light comes back, the next tooth is blocking, so the number of teeth that have passed is an integer. So the time is t=2d/c, and in that time, the number of teeth that passed is N_teeth_per_second * t.

So N_teeth_per_second is 1500 rpm *600 teeth per rev /60 s/min → 1500*600/60=15,000 teeth/s.

So number of teeth during time t is 15,000 * t.

t=2d/c.

So 15,000 * (2d/c) = integer.

At the first eclipse, this integer is 1, I think. So 15,000*(2d/c)=1 → c= 2d *15,000.

Wait, that's the same as before.

So c=2*4980*15,000= 9960 *15,000= 1.494e8 m/s.

But again, that's about half the speed of light. So I'm missing something.

Wait a second, perhaps the Fizeau method actually gives twice the speed I'm calculating. Wait, in Fizeau's experiment, the formula might be different. Because I thought in Fizeau's setup, the light passes through the wheel twice: once going to the mirror and once coming back. So the total distance is 2d. But perhaps I should consider this.

Wait, let me look up the Fizeau formula again. Oh wait, perhaps the formula is c = (2d * N * n) / (60 * k), where N is rpm, n is the number of teeth, d is the distance, and k is the order of the eclipse (like first eclipse k=1, second k=2, etc.)

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the formula is c= (d * N * n) / (60 * t), but I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the formula in terms of the angular velocity.

Wait, another source I recall says that the speed of light is given by c = (2d * f) / (n), where f is the frequency of the tooth passing by, and n is the number of teeth?

Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is c= (2d * ω * n)/(2π), which simplifies to c= (d * ω *n)/π.

Wait, let's try that. ω is 50π rad/s, as before.

n is 600 teeth.

d is 4980 meters.

So c= (4980 *50π *600)/π → the π cancels out.

So 4980 *50 *600 = ?

4980 *50 is 249,000.

249,000 *600 = 149,400,000 → 1.494e8 m/s.

Same result again. So I'm consistently getting 1.494e8 m/s, but the known value is about 3e8 m/s. So I'm off by a factor of two.

Wait, perhaps the time I calculated was wrong. Let me think again about the eclipse condition.

In Fizeau's experiment, the first eclipse (when the light is blocked) occurs when the wheel has rotated by half a tooth's position during the light's round trip. Because when the light goes through a tooth, by the time it returns, the next tooth is in place, blocking it.

Wait, maybe that's the case. So perhaps the time for the light's round trip is T, and in that time, the wheel has rotated by one tooth's angle. Because when the light arrives back, the next tooth is blocking. So the rotation required is for the next tooth to be in the path.

Wait, but in my earlier calculation, that's exactly what I did—so the time for the wheel to rotate by one tooth is T=1/(15000) s, and 2d/c = T, leading to c=2d/(T).

But that gives me 1.494e8 m/s, which is about half of 3e8. So I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the distance is one way, so the round trip is 2d, but the formula uses just d. No, because I used 2d in calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I
