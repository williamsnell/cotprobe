Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this physics problem here. Let me read it again. The question is about the shape of the illuminated area on a screen when light from the sun is reflected off a tiny plane mirror. The mirror is 2 mm by 2 mm in size. They're asking for two cases: (a) when the screen is 1 cm away and (b) when it's 2 meters away.

Hmm, I remember that mirrors can create images based on their shape and the distance from the source. Wait, but wait—this isn't a regular mirror; it's a tiny one. Also, the light is from the sun, which I think is a source of parallel light rays because the sun is so far away. So the light reaching the mirror would be parallel.

When parallel light hits a plane mirror, the reflection would form a virtual image. But wait, no, in the case of a plane mirror, the image is virtual and the same size as the object. But wait, in this case, the object is the sun, which is a huge source of light. But wait, the mirror is tiny, so maybe the reflection isn't forming an image of the sun but rather acting like a point source?

Wait, no. Let me think again. When sunlight reflects off a mirror, each point on the mirror reflects the light. The mirror is small, so the reflected light would spread out. But the shape of the illuminated area on the screen depends on the distance from the mirror.

So, considering the mirror's size, which is 2 mm on each side. At a certain distance, the light rays would have spread enough to form a specific shape.

Wait, when the screen is very close, like 1 cm away, the distance is much smaller than the mirror's size. So the reflection would create an image where the light hasn't had much time to spread. So the shape would probably be similar to the mirror's shape, which is square. So a square illuminated area.

But wait, the mirror is reflecting sunlight. Sunlight comes in parallel rays. So each point on the mirror reflects these rays. At a distance much larger than the mirror's size, the reflected rays would form a circular shape because the angular spread would cover 180 degrees around each point. Wait, no. Wait, when a point source is reflected from a plane mirror, you get a virtual image. But if the source is very far away (like the sun), then the rays are parallel.

So, when the screen is placed at a distance L from the mirror, the size of the illuminated spot depends on L relative to the mirror's size. If L is much smaller than the mirror's size, the spot would be square. But when L is much larger, the spot would be a circle because the reflected rays spread out in a circular pattern.

Wait, but wait. Let me think of the mirror as a point. If the mirror were a point, reflecting parallel rays would produce a beam expanding at an angle, but the spot would be a circle because diffraction might make it so. But in reality, the mirror is an extended object, not a point. So for small distances, the geometrical optics approach applies, and the shadow would be the shape of the mirror—so square. At larger distances, diffraction might dominate, leading to a circular spot due to the diffraction pattern.

Wait, but the mirror is 2mm x 2mm. So the screen is 1 cm away—about 10 mm. That's five times the mirror's size in each dimension. So the angle subtended by the mirror at the screen is small, so the shape would still be square. Wait, but that depends on the distances. Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the beam spread.

Wait, when you have a mirror of size D, the light rays that reflect from it will form a cone of light. The angle of spread depends on the ratio of the mirror size to the distance. So for small D compared to L, the spot would be larger than the mirror's size but retain its shape? Or maybe it's the opposite.

Wait, imagine the mirror is at a certain point. Each point on the mirror reflects the light in various directions. For a distant screen, each point's reflection would spread out. But wait, if the screen is very far away, the illuminated area would approximate a circle because the mirror's size would cause the light to spread out in a circular pattern due to the finite size of the mirror.

Alternatively, perhaps the illuminated area's shape depends on the mirror's shape and the distance. So for a small distance (like 1 cm), the image is a square because it's just the mirror's shape projected. But for a larger distance (like 2 meters), the light spreads out enough that it becomes a circle because the diffraction or the beam spread causes it to circularize.

Wait, but wait. Let me think about the geometry. The mirror is 2mm on each side. At 1 cm = 10 mm away, the screen is 5 times the mirror's size. So the angle θ would be tanθ ≈ (2mm/2)/(10 mm) ) = 0.1. So about 5.7 degrees. So the spot size would be the mirror's size times (distance / mirror size). Wait, no. Wait, the spot size would be determined by the mirror's size and the distance. The spot's width on the screen would be mirror size multiplied by (distance / focal length), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, for a plane mirror, the reflected light from each point on the mirror would form a point image on the screen. But since the mirror is extended, the image would be a square. But that's only if the light rays don't spread much. Wait, but the sun's rays are parallel. So each point on the mirror reflects the rays in a direction determined by the law of reflection.

Wait, perhaps I should model the mirror as a square of size 2mm. Each point on the square reflects the light. Since the incoming light is parallel (from the sun), each point on the mirror reflects the light in a direction θ = angle of incidence. But since the mirror is square, each corner reflects in a slightly different direction. So the overall reflection would form a square-shaped beam on the screen when the screen is close. But as the screen moves further away, the beam spreads more, and perhaps the shape becomes more circular.

But wait, geometrically, a square mirror reflecting parallel light would produce an image that's a square on a nearby screen. As the screen gets further away, the square would get larger but remain square. Unless the light starts to spread beyond the edges due to diffraction, causing the shape to round. However, diffraction effects are more prominent when the size is small compared to the wavelength, but here the mirror is macroscopic, so geometric optics should dominate.

Wait, but the options don't include square for (b). Let me look at the options. The options are:

A: (a) circular, (b) rectangular

B: (a) square, (b) circular

C: (a) elliptical, (b) circular

D: (a) square, (b) elliptical

E: (a) rectangular, (b) elliptical

F: (a) rectangular, (b) circular

Hmm. So option B says (a) square and (b) circular. Option F says (a) rectangular, (b) circular. But the mirror is square, so (a) would be square.

Wait, but wait. When the light reflects off a square mirror, the image on a nearby screen would be a square, but when the screen is far away, the image would still be a square, just larger. So why would it become circular?

Unless I'm missing something. Maybe I'm confusing this with the case when the light source is a point. But in this case, the sun is an extended source, but we can approximate it as a parallel beam because it's so far away.

Wait, another approach. The mirror is small, 2x2 mm. When the screen is 1 cm away, which is 10 mm. The mirror's size is 2mm, so the screen is at 5 times the mirror's size. So the beam spread would be small, and the image would be a square. But when the screen is 2 meters away, which is 2000 mm, the mirror's size is 2mm, so 1000 times larger distance.

At such a large distance, the beam would spread significantly. But geometrically, the shape would still be square. Wait, but maybe not. Because each point on the mirror reflects light in all directions, but the screen captures the light from all parts of the mirror. Wait, no, because the mirror is flat, each part reflects the incident parallel light in a specific direction.

Wait, perhaps the illuminated area is determined by the mirror's shape. For a square mirror reflecting parallel light, the image on a screen at any distance should be a square, larger but still square. Unless the screen's position causes the image to be different.

Alternatively, maybe the light spreads out such that the shape changes with distance. Let me think in terms of rays. Each corner of the mirror reflects the light. For a nearby screen, the four corners' reflections would form a square, because the spread isn't enough to make them overlap. But as the screen moves further away, the spread between the corners' reflections increases, but the overall shape might still be square.

Wait, no, perhaps for very large distances, the four corners' reflections would form a larger square. So the shape remains square. Hmm. So why would the options suggest it becomes circular?

Alternatively, perhaps I'm considering diffraction. If the mirror is acting like an aperture, at large distances, the diffraction pattern would be a circular spot (Airy disk). But the mirror is 2mm in size, which is much larger than the wavelength of light, so diffraction effects would be negligible. So geometric optics apply, and the shape is square regardless of distance.

Wait, but then looking at the options, only option B has (a) square and (b) circular, but I thought it would be square in both cases. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the mirror's effect. The mirror reflects light, but if the screen is very far away, perhaps the light spreads enough to cause the image to be a circle. Wait, but geometric optics says it should be a square. Unless considering that the mirror's edges cause the light to form a circular pattern due to the way light spreads.

Alternatively, maybe when the screen is very far away, the image becomes a circle because each point on the mirror contributes to a circular spread. But I'm not sure about that. I think geometrically, it should remain a square.

Wait, but perhaps the mirror is so small that the light spreads out, but the initial shape is square. Wait, no, the mirror's size is 2mm, which is larger than the wavelength, so it's a macroscopic object. So geometric optics apply, and the image should be the same shape as the mirror at any distance.

So for case (a), 1 cm away, the illuminated area is square. For (b), 2 meters away, it's also square. But looking at the options, none of them have both (a) and (b) as square. The closest is option B, which has (a) square, (b) circular. Or option D: (a) square, (b) elliptical.

Alternatively, perhaps when the mirror is small, the image becomes a point spread function, which is circular due to diffraction. But for macroscopic mirrors, geometric optics dominate, so the shape is square.

Wait, maybe the confusion is between reflection from a point versus an extended mirror. For a point mirror, the reflection would spread out as a circle, but for an extended mirror, it's square.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the mirror, being a small but finite size, when reflecting parallel light, will produce a beam that's square in shape when close, but as it propagates, the edges spread, and it becomes more circular. Because light from each edge of the mirror spreads outward. So at a large distance, the square's corners would have spread into a circular shape.

Wait, that makes sense. Think of it like this: when the screen is near, the light from each part of the mirror hasn't had time to spread much, so the illuminated area is square. But when the screen is far away, the light from each edge has spread out enough that the corners of the square meet, making a circular shape.

So for (a), 1 cm: square. For (b), 2 meters: circular.

Looking at the options, option B is (a) square, (b) circular. Option F is (a) rectangular, (b) circular. But the mirror is square, so (a) should be square, making option B the right choice.

Wait, but the mirror is 2x2 mm, which is a square. So the reflection should be square. So (a) is square, (b) is circular. So option B is the correct answer.

When sunlight, which can be approximated as parallel rays due to the sun's distance, reflects off a tiny plane mirror measuring 2 mm × 2 mm, the shape of the illuminated area on a screen depends on the distance between the mirror and the screen.

At a distance of 1 cm (10 mm), the screen is relatively close to the mirror. Since the mirror is small but macroscopic, geometric optics dominate, and the illuminated area retains the shape of the mirror. Thus, the illuminated area on the screen is square.

At a distance of 2 meters (2000 mm), the screen is far away. Over such a large distance, the reflected light rays from the edges of the mirror spread out significantly. While geometric optics would still suggest a square shape, the spreading of light from the mirror's edges causes the illuminated area to circularize due to the natural beam spread and the finite size of the mirror. As a result, the illuminated area becomes circular.

Given these considerations, the correct answer is:

(a) square, (b) circular.

The correct option is **B**.
