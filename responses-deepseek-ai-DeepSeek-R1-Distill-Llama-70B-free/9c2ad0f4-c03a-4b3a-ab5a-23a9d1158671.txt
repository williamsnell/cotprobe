Okay, so I've got this question about binary channels and decision-making. Hmm, let's try to unpack this. I'm a bit rusty on my information theory, but I'll give it a shot.

So the question says that the cost of making the correct decisions is zero. That means if we decide d1 when x1 was sent, the cost is zero, same for d2 when x2 is sent. But if we make a wrong decision, there's a cost involved. Specifically, the cost of deciding d1 when x2 was sent (which is wrong) is twice as much as deciding d2 when x1 was sent. So c(d1/x2) = 2 * c(d2/x1). 

The given probabilities are P(y1|x1) = 0.8 and P(y2|x2) = 0.6. Also, the prior probability P(x1) is 0.8. So x1 is more likely to be the source than x2, which makes sense since P(x1) is 0.8 and P(x2) must be 0.2.

The question is asking what decision should be made when y1 is received and when y2 is received. So we need to figure out, for each received signal y, whether we should decide d1, d2, or perhaps make a random decision or no decision.

I remember that in Bayesian decision theory, the optimal decision is based on minimizing the expected cost, or equivalently, the risk. So for each y, we calculate the posterior probabilities and compare the risks of each possible decision.

Let's think about part (a) first: when y1 is received, what should we do. We need to compute P(x1|y1) and P(x2|y1) and see which decision gives the lower expected cost.

Using Bayes' theorem:

P(x1|y1) = [P(y1|x1) * P(x1)] / P(y1)
Similarly for P(x2|y1).

But wait, what's P(y1)? It's the total probability of y1 happening. So P(y1) = P(y1|x1)P(x1) + P(y1|x2)P(x2). 

Wait, I know that P(y1|x2) is 1 - P(y2|x2) because if y2 is not received, y1 must be. Since P(y2|x2)=0.6, then P(y1|x2)=0.4. Similarly, P(y2|x1)=1 - P(y1|x1)=0.2.

So P(y1) = (0.8)(0.8) + (0.4)(0.2) = 0.64 + 0.08 = 0.72.

Thus, P(x1|y1) = (0.8 * 0.8)/0.72 = 0.64 / 0.72 = 8/9 ≈ 0.8889. Similarly, P(x2|y1)=1 - 8/9 = 1/9 ≈ 0.1111.

Now, the cost of deciding d1 when x1 is true is 0, and when x2 is true, it's 2c. Wait, no, the costs are for making mistakes. So the cost matrix is:

If we decide d1:
- Correct: x1, cost 0.
- Wrong: x2, cost 2c.

If we decide d2:
- Correct: x2, cost 0.
- Wrong: x1, cost c.

So for a given y, we compute the expected cost for deciding d1 and d2.

Expected cost for d1 when y1 is received: C(d1|y1) = 0 * P(x1|y1) + 2c * P(x2|y1) = 0 + 2c*(1/9) = (2c/9).

Expected cost for d2 when y1 is received: C(d2|y1) = c * P(x1|y1) + 0 * P(x2|y1) = c*(8/9) + 0 = (8c/9).

Now compare these two. Which is lower? 2c/9 is approximately 0.222c, and 8c/9 is about 0.888c. So 0.222c < 0.888c, so the expected cost is lower if we decide d1. So for y1, we should choose d1.

Now part (b): when y2 is received. Let's do the same steps.

Compute P(x1|y2) and P(x2|y2).

P(y2) = P(y2|x1)P(x1) + P(y2|x2)P(x2) = (0.2)(0.8) + (0.6)(0.2) = 0.16 + 0.12 = 0.28.

So P(x1|y2) = [0.2 * 0.8]/0.28 = 0.16 / 0.28 ≈ 4/7 ≈ 0.5714. P(x2|y2)=1 - 4/7 = 3/7 ≈ 0.4286.

Now expected cost for d1: C(d1|y2) = 0*P(x1|y2) + 2c*P(x2|y2) = 0 + 2c*(3/7) = 6c/7 ≈ 0.857c.

Expected cost for d2: C(d2|y2) = c*P(x1|y2) + 0*P(x2|y2) = c*(4/7) + 0 = 4c/7 ≈ 0.571c.

Comparing 6c/7 and 4c/7: 4c/7 is lower. So when y2 is received, the expected cost is lower if we choose d2.

So for part (a), decision is d1; part (b), decision is d2.

Looking back at the options:

Option H says (a) d1, (b) d2. So the answer should be H.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't flip any numbers. P(x1|y1) was 8/9, so choosing d1 is better. P(x2|y2) is 3/7, so d2 is better. Yep, that's correct.

To determine the optimal decisions for the given binary channel, we use Bayesian decision theory to minimize the expected cost. The cost structure is as follows:

- **Correct decisions**: \( c(d_1/x_1) = 0 \), \( c(d_2/x_2) = 0 \).
- **Incorrect decisions**: \( c(d_1/x_2) = 2c \), \( c(d_2/x_1) = c \).

The given probabilities are:
- \( P(y_1/x_1) = 0.8 \), \( P(y_2/x_2) = 0.6 \),
- \( P(x_1) = 0.8 \), so \( P(x_2) = 0.2 \).

### Part (a): When \( y_1 \) is received
1. Calculate \( P(x_1|y_1) \) and \( P(x_2|y_1) \) using Bayes' theorem:
   - \( P(y_1) = P(y_1/x_1)P(x_1) + P(y_1/x_2)P(x_2) \),
     where \( P(y_1/x_2) = 1 - P(y_2/x_2) = 0.4 \).
   - \( P(y_1) = (0.8)(0.8) + (0.4)(0.2) = 0.72 \).
   - \( P(x_1|y_1) = \frac{P(y_1/x_1)P(x_1)}{P(y_1)} = \frac{0.8 \cdot 0.8}{0.72} = \frac{8}{9} \),
     \( P(x_2|y_1) = 1 - P(x_1|y_1) = \frac{1}{9} \).

2. Compute the expected costs:
   - \( C(d_1|y_1) = 0 \cdot P(x_1|y_1) + 2c \cdot P(x_2|y_1) = 2c \cdot \frac{1}{9} = \frac{2c}{9} \),
   - \( C(d_2|y_1) = c \cdot P(x_1|y_1) + 0 \cdot P(x_2|y_1) = c \cdot \frac{8}{9} = \frac{8c}{9} \).

Since \( \frac{2c}{9} < \frac{8c}{9} \), the expected cost is lower for \( d_1 \). Thus, when \( y_1 \) is received, the decision should be \( d_1 \).

---

### Part (b): When \( y_2 \) is received
1. Calculate \( P(x_1|y_2) \) and \( P(x_2|y_2) \) using Bayes' theorem:
   - \( P(y_2) = P(y_2/x_1)P(x_1) + P(y_2/x_2)P(x_2) \),
     where \( P(y_2/x_1) = 1 - P(y_1/x_1) = 0.2 \).
   - \( P(y_2) = (0.2)(0.8) + (0.6)(0.2) = 0.28 \).
   - \( P(x_1|y_2) = \frac{P(y_2/x_1)P(x_1)}{P(y_2)} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 0.8}{0.28} = \frac{4}{7} \),
     \( P(x_2|y_2) = 1 - P(x_1|y_2) = \frac{3}{7} \).

2. Compute the expected costs:
   - \( C(d_1|y_2) = 0 \cdot P(x_1|y_2) + 2c \cdot P(x_2|y_2) = 2c \cdot \frac{3}{7} = \frac{6c}{7} \),
   - \( C(d_2|y_2) = c \cdot P(x_1|y_2) + 0 \cdot P(x_2|y_2) = c \cdot \frac{4}{7} = \frac{4c}{7} \).

Since \( \frac{4c}{7} < \frac{6c}{7} \), the expected cost is lower for \( d_2 \). Thus, when \( y_2 \) is received, the decision should be \( d_2 \).

---

### Final Answer
(a) Decision: \( d_1 \), (b) Decision: \( d_2 \).

This corresponds to **Option H**.
