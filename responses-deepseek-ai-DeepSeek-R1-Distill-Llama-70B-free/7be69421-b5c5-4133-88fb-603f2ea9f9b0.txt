Okay, so I've got this math problem here about average salaries and percentage increases. Hmm, let's see. The question says that the average salary at Bedford Manufacturing Co. rose by 60% over a 10-year period, and this rise amounted to $42.50 a week. I need to find the average weekly salary at the beginning and at the end of this period.

Alright, let's break this down. So, part (a) is the starting salary, and part (b) is the ending salary. The increase is 60%, which equals $42.50. I remember that percentage increase is calculated based on the original value. So if the increase is 60%, that's 60% of the original salary, which is given as $42.50.

Wait, so the way to find the original salary is to realize that 60% of it equals $42.50. Let me write that out. Let’s call the original salary S. So 60% of S is $42.50. In equation form, that's 0.6 * S = 42.50. To find S, I need to divide both sides by 0.6. 

Let me do the math. 42.50 divided by 0.6. Hmm, 42 divided by 0.6 is 70, because 0.6 times 70 is 42. Then 0.50 divided by 0.6 is... 0.50/0.6 is like 5/6, which is approximately 0.8333. So adding that to 70 gives 70.8333... So the original salary would be $70.83 per week. Wait, but let me check that calculation again because sometimes I might make a mistake.

Wait, 0.6 times 70 is indeed 42. So 42.50 is 0.6 times S. So S is 42.50 / 0.6. Let me compute that more accurately. 42.50 divided by 0.6. Well, 42.5 ÷ 0.6 is the same as 4250 ÷ 6. Let me calculate that. 6 goes into 42 seven times (7*6=42), remainder 0. Bring down the 5, 5 divided by 6 is 0. Then bring down the 0. 0 divided by 6 is 0. So 70.8333... So yes, $70.83 is the original salary.

So part (a) is $70.83. Now, for part (b), the ending salary would be the original plus the increase, right? So that's $70.83 plus $42.50. Let me add those. 70 + 42 is 112, 0.83 + 0.50 is 1.33. So 112 + 1.33 is 113.33. So the ending salary is $113.33.

Wait, but wait. Alternatively, since the salary increased by 60%, the ending salary is the original plus 60% of it. So that would be S + 0.6S = 1.6S. So 1.6 times 70.83. Let me calculate that. 70 * 1.6 is 112. 0.83 * 1.6 is 1.328. Adding those gives 112 + 1.328 = 113.328, which rounds to 113.33. Yep, same result.

Now, looking at the options, I need to find which option has (a) $70.83 and (b) $113.33. Let me look through the choices.

Option A: $75.83, $118.33 → No, too high on both.
Option B: $90.83, $133.33 → Also higher.
Option C: $80.83, $123.33 → Hmm, no.
Option D: $55.83, $98.33 → Lower.
Option E: $50.83, $93.33 → No.
Option F: $70.83, $113.33 → Wait, that's exactly what I got.
Option G: $45.83, $88.33 → No.
Option H: $85.83, $128.33 → No.
Option I: $60.83, $103.33 → No.
Option J: $65.83, $108.33 → No.

So the correct choice should be option F. But wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the calculations. Let me recompute S. 42.50 is 60% of S, so S = 42.50 / 0.6.

Calculating 42.5 ÷ 0.6. Let's do it step by step. 0.6 times 70 is 42. So 70 gives 42, leaving 0.5. 0.5 divided by 0.6 is 5/6, which is about 0.8333. So yes, S is 70.8333. Then the ending is 1.6 * 70.8333 = 113.3333. So the ending is 113.33. That's exactly option F.

I think that's right. So the answer is option F.

To solve the problem, we need to determine the average weekly salary at the beginning and end of a 10-year period during which the salary increased by 60%, corresponding to a $42.50 rise.

### Part (a): Finding the initial salary
Let the initial salary be \( S \). The increase of 60% means:
\[
0.6 \cdot S = 42.50
\]
Solving for \( S \):
\[
S = \frac{42.50}{0.6} = 70.83
\]
Thus, the average weekly salary at the beginning of the period was **$70.83**.

### Part (b): Finding the final salary
The final salary is the sum of the initial salary and the increase:
\[
\text{Final Salary} = S + 42.50 = 70.83 + 42.50 = 113.33
\]
Thus, the average weekly salary at the end of the period was **$113.33**.

### Matching the options
From the given options, the correct choice is **F: $70.83, $113.33**.
