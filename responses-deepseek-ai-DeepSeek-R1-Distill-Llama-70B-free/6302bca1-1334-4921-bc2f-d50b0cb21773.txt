Question:

7.1-3. To determine the effect of $100 \%$ nitrate on the growth of pea plants, several specimens were planted and then watered with $100 \%$ nitrate every day. At the end of
two weeks, the plants were measured. Here are data on seven of them:
$$
\begin{array}{lllllll}
17.5 & 14.5 & 15.2 & 14.0 & 17.3 & 18.0 & 13.8
\end{array}
$$
Assume that these data are a random sample from a normal distribution $N\left(\mu, \sigma^2\right)$.

D: $15.471$
E: $15.000$
F: $17.142$
G: $14.328$
H: $18.357$
I: $17.512$
J:  $15.757$

Okay, so I have this statistics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question is about determining the effect of 100% nitrate on pea plants. They planted several pea plants and watered them every day with 100% nitrate for two weeks. Then they measured the plants. The data given are the heights of seven plants: 17.5, 14.5, 15.2, 14.0, 17.3, 18.0, and 13.8.

The task is to find a point estimate of μ, the mean of the population. The options are given from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, point estimate usually refers to using a sample statistic to estimate the population parameter. Since μ is the population mean, the appropriate point estimate would be the sample mean, which is the average of the sample data.

So, I think the first thing I need to do is calculate the sample mean. That involves adding up all the data points and then dividing by the number of data points, which is seven in this case.

Let me list the data again to make sure I have them all correct: 17.5, 14.5, 15.2, 14.0, 17.3, 18.0, 13.8.

Let me add them one by one:

Start with 17.5. Adding 14.5 makes 32.0. Then add 15.2, which brings it to 47.2. Adding 14.0 gives 61.2. Then 17.3 adds up to 78.5. Next, 18.0 makes it 96.5. Finally, adding the last one, 13.8, gives a total of 110.3.

Wait, let me double-check that addition because it's easy to make a mistake here.

Let me add them again:

17.5 +14.5 = 32.0

32.0 +15.2 = 47.2

47.2 +14.0 = 61.2

61.2 +17.3 = 78.5

78.5 +18.0 = 96.5

96.5 +13.8 = 110.3

Yes, that's correct. So the total is 110.3.

Now, since there are seven plants, the sample mean is 110.3 divided by 7.

Let me compute that. 110.3 /7.

Hmm, 7 times 15 is 105. 110.3 - 105 is 5.3. So 5.3 divided by 7 is approximately 0.757. So 15 + 0.757 is 15.757.

Wait, but let me do the division more accurately. 7 into 110.3.

7*15=105, remainder 5.3.

5.3 divided by 7 is 0.757 approx. So 15.757.

Looking at the options, option J is 15.757. So that's probably the correct answer.

Wait, let me make sure that I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me add the numbers again just to confirm.

17.5 +14.5 is 32.0.

32.0 +15.2 is 47.2.

47.2 +14.0 is 61.2.

61.2 +17.3 is 78.5.

78.5 +18.0 is 96.5.

96.5 +13.8 is 110.3. Correct.

110.3 divided by 7 is 15.757. Yes.

So the point estimate, which is the sample mean, is 15.757. Looking at the options, J is 15.757, so the answer should be J.

To determine the point estimate of the population mean $\mu$, we calculate the sample mean. The sample mean is obtained by summing all the data points and dividing by the number of observations. The data provided are:

$$
17.5, 14.5, 15.2, 14.0, 17.3, 18.0, 13.8
$$

First, we sum the data:

$$
17.5 + 14.5 + 15.2 + 14.0 + 17.3 + 18.0 + 13.8 = 110.3
$$

Next, we divide the total by the number of observations, which is 7:

$$
\text{Sample Mean} = \frac{110.3}{7} \approx 15.757
$$

Thus, the point estimate of $\mu$ is approximately $15.757$. Comparing this result with the given options, the correct answer is:

J: $15.757$
