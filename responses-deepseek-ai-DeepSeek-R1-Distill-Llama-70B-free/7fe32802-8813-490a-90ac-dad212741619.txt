Question:

A witness lived next door to a victim. Late one night, the witness overheard the victim scream, "The defendant, please don't do it!" The next day the victim was found dead in her bedroom. The defendant was arrested and charged with murdering the victim. At trial, the witness proposes to testify to the victim's statement. Upon objection by defendant's counsel, the court should rule the witness's testimony regarding the victim's statement

Options:

A: admissible as a past recollection recorded if the witness can confirm the statement was made.
B: admissible as a dying declaration if the jury determines that the victim believed that her death was imminent.
C: admissible as a dying declaration if the judge, by preponderance of the evidence, determines that the victim believed that her death was imminent.
D: inadmissible, because the probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.
E: inadmissible, because the statement was not made under oath.
F: inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception.
G: inadmissible, because the statement is considered a character evidence.
H: admissible, because the statement is a present sense impression.
I: inadmissible, because the statement can lead to a character attack on the defendant.

Okay, so I've got this evidence question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

The scenario is about a witness who overheard a victim scream something and then the victim was found dead. The defendant is on trial for murder, and the witness wants to testify about the victim's statement. The defense objects, and the court has to decide if the testimony is admissible.

The statement in question is, "The defendant, please don't do it!" The key here is that the witness heard the victim say this late at night, and the next day the victim was dead. So the statement is being offered to prove that the defendant committed the murder, I suppose.

The issue is whether this statement is admissible under the rules of evidence. It's a hearsay statement because it's an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. So I need to think about the exceptions to the hearsay rule.

Hearsay exceptions include dying declarations, excited utterances, present sense impressions, and others. Let me go through them one by one.

First, dying declarations. A dying declaration is admissible if the declarant is unavailable (which they are here, since the victim is dead) and if the statement was made under the belief that death was imminent. So the question is, did the victim believe her death was imminent when she made that statement?

The statement was made late at night, right before she was found dead the next day. So the timing is a bit tricky. If she screamed that, was she in fear of imminent death at that moment? Or was she just scared but not necessarily thinking she was about to die?

I think that for a dying declaration, the declarant must have a subjective belief that their death is imminent. The jury might infer that from the contextâ€”like if someone is being attacked, they might think they're about to die. But the court usually makes that determination, not the jury. Wait, no, I think the standard is that the judge determines whether the statement qualifies under the exception by a preponderance of the evidence. So option C says it's admissible as a dying declaration if the judge determines, by preponderance, that the victim believed death was imminent. Option B says the jury decides that. So I think C is correct on that point.

Another option is excited utterance, which is under FRE 803(2). An excited utterance is a statement made under the stress of a startling event or condition. The statement has to relate to the event and be made while under the stress. So here, the victim screamed, which suggests she was under stress. The statement was made during the event (the attack), so it could qualify as an excited utterance. But wait, the next day she was found dead, so the event was the attack, but the statement was made during that event. So maybe it's an excited utterance. But wait, I thought excited utterances don't require the declarant to be unavailable; they can testify or not. So if that's the case, maybe this statement fits under excited utterance.

Wait, but wait, the options don't have excited utterance as a choice. Looking back, option H says "admissible as a present sense impression." Present sense impression is another exception under 803(1), which is a statement describing an event made while the declarant was perceiving it or immediately thereafter. But the statement here is a plea, not a description. So maybe not present sense.

Alternatively, option F says inadmissible as hearsay not within any exception. But if it fits under dying declaration or excited utterance, then F wouldn't be correct.

Wait, but the statement is "The defendant, please don't do it!" That's more of a plea than a statement describing the event. So would that fit under excited utterance? Excited utterances can include statements that are reactions to the event, not just descriptions. So perhaps it does qualify.

Alternatively, maybe it's a dying declaration. The problem is whether she believed she was about to die. If the statement was made during the attack, and she was killed the same night, perhaps she knew she was in mortal danger. So the court would need to decide whether, based on the circumstances, she had that belief. If the judge finds that, then the statement comes in as a dying declaration.

But wait, in some jurisdictions, the requirement is that the declarant's belief of imminent death is actual and the statement is about the cause or circumstances of their impending death. So if she said, "Don't do it," perhaps implying that the defendant was about to kill her, that might fit.

So looking at the options, option C is about the judge determining by preponderance that she believed death was imminent. Option B leaves it to the jury, which I think isn't correct because the admissibility is determined by the judge.

Another point is that some courts might consider whether the statement is too self-serving or if it's being used to accuse someone. Sometimes dying declarations are excluded if they seem to be accusations because they lack the trustworthiness. But I think that's more of a factor in the residual exception, not the specific dying declaration rule.

So if the statement is a dying declaration, then option C would be correct. Alternatively, if it's an excited utterance, then maybe it's admissible under that. But the problem is that the options don't have an excited utterance choice.

Looking at the options again:

Option B: admissible as a dying declaration if the jury decides she believed death was imminent. I think this is wrong because the judge, not the jury, decides the foundational facts for admissibility.

Option C: ...if the judge determines by preponderance. That's correct, because the judge decides whether the statement meets the exception.

Option F: inadmissible as hearsay not within any exception. If either dying declaration or excited utterance applies, F is wrong.

So the key is whether the statement qualifies as a dying declaration. Let's think: Did the victim believe her death was imminent when she made the statement? If she was being attacked and screamed that, perhaps she did. The timing is right before she died, so the judge could find that she believed she was about to die.

If that's the case, then the statement is admissible as a dying declaration under option C.

Wait, but another possibility is that the statement is an excited utterance because it was made during a startling event. So under 803(2), the statement is admissible as an excited utterance, regardless of whether it's a dying declaration. But I don't see an option that mentions excited utterance. The options are A through J. Let me check the options again.

Option H says admissible as a present sense impression. That requires that the statement describe an event while perceiving it or immediately after. The statement here is a plea, not a description. So probably not.

So if it's admissible as a dying declaration, then option C would be the choice. But if it's inadmissible because, for example, it's hearsay and doesn't fit any exception, then F would be correct.

Wait, another point: The statement is being used to accuse the defendant. Some courts are cautious about admitting dying declarations that are accusatory because they can be seen as untrustworthy. But the Federal Rules don't exclude such statements; they're admissible as long as the foundation is met.

So I think the correct answer is either B or C, depending on who determines the belief of imminent death.

No, wait, I think I was right earlier. The judge determines whether the statement fits the exception. So the judge must find by a preponderance that the victim believed death was imminent. Therefore, option C is correct.

Alternatively, if the statement doesn't fit any exception, it's inadmissible as hearsay. But I think it does fit as a dying declaration if the judge finds the belief.

So the answer should be C.

Wait, but another thought: The statement was made the night before she was found dead. So was she in fear of imminent death at that time? If she was attacked that night and died the next day, perhaps she was in fear when she made the statement. So the judge could find that she believed she was about to die.

Yes, so the court should admit it under the dying declaration exception after the judge makes that determination.

So the answer is C.
</think>

The question revolves around the admissibility of a hearsay statement made by a victim, who was later found dead, in a murder trial. The victim screamed, "The defendant, please don't do it!" late one night, and the witness seeks to testify about this statement. The defense objects, and the court must decide whether the statement is admissible under the rules of evidence.

The statement is hearsay because it is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. To be admissible, it must fall under a recognized hearsay exception. The key exceptions to consider here are dying declarations and excited utterances.

### Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A**: This refers to "past recollection recorded," which is irrelevant here because the witness is testifying about a direct statement they overheard, not a recorded recollection.

2. **Option B**: This suggests the statement is admissible as a dying declaration if the jury determines the victim believed death was imminent. However, the determination of whether a statement qualifies as a dying declaration is made by the judge, not the jury. Thus, this option is incorrect.

3. **Option C**: This states the statement is admissible as a dying declaration if the judge determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the victim believed death was imminent. This aligns with the legal standard for admitting dying declarations, as the judge must make the foundational determination. This option is correct if the statement qualifies as a dying declaration.

4. **Option D**: This argues the statement is inadmissible because its probative value is outweighed by unfair prejudice. There is no indication in the facts that this is the case, so this option is incorrect.

5. **Option E**: This claims inadmissibility because the statement was not made under oath. However, dying declarations and other hearsay exceptions do not require the statement to be made under oath, so this is incorrect.

6. **Option F**: This suggests the statement is inadmissible as hearsay not within any recognized exception. If the statement qualifies as a dying declaration or an excited utterance, this option would be incorrect.

7. **Option G**: This argues inadmissibility because the statement is character evidence. The statement is being offered to prove the defendant's actions, not the victim's character, so this is irrelevant and incorrect.

8. **Option H**: This claims the statement is admissible as a present sense impression. A present sense impression requires the statement to describe an event while it is being perceived or immediately thereafter. The victim's plea ("The defendant, please don't do it!") is not a descriptive statement about the event but rather a reaction to it, so this option is incorrect.

9. **Option I**: This argues inadmissibility because the statement could lead to a character attack on the defendant. However, the statement is being offered to prove the defendant's actions, not their character, so this is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The statement can be admissible as a dying declaration if the judge determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the victim believed her death was imminent when she made the statement. This aligns with the legal standard for admitting dying declarations. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: admissible as a dying declaration if the judge, by preponderance of the evidence, determines that the victim believed that her death was imminent.**
