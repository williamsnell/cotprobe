Okay, so I have this question about which article is not a qualified right. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my human rights articles, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) has a list of articles, some of which are absolute rights and others are qualified. Qualified rights mean that the government can impose certain restrictions under specific circumstances, like public safety or national security. Absolute rights can't be limited except in the most extreme cases, if at all.

Looking at the options: A is Article 19, B is 11, C is 12, D is 9, E is 3, F is 17.

I think Article 3 is about torture and inhuman treatment. That's an absolute right, right? Because no circumstances justify torture. So E would be an absolute right, making it not a qualified right.

Wait, but the question is asking which are not qualified. So the answer would be the absolute ones. So E (Article 3) is absolute. What about the others?

Article 9 is freedom of thought, conscience, and religion. I believe this is a qualified right because it can be limited for public safety, order, health, or morals. So D is qualified.

Article 10 is freedom of expression, which is definitely a qualified right. Oh wait, but the options don't have 10. Hmm.

Wait the options are A:19, which I'm not sure about. Oh wait, maybe I'm mixing up the articles. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I should list out some key articles. 

- Article 2: Right to life (absolute, with some exceptions like self-defense, but generally considered absolute)
- Article 3: Prohibition of torture (absolute)
- Article 4: Prohibition of slavery (absolute)
- Article 5: Right to liberty (qualified, as there are exceptions like lawful detention)
- Article 6: Fair trial (absolute in the sense that it's a fundamental right, but perhaps some aspects are subject to limitations)
- Article 8: Right to privacy (qualified, can be limited for various reasons)
- Article 9: Freedom of thought (qualified)
- Article 10: Freedom of expression (qualified)
- Article 11: Freedom of assembly (qualified)
- Article 12: Right to marry (I think this is absolute, but I'm not certain)
- Article 14: No discrimination (absolute in application, but maybe not a right that's limited)
- Article 17: Prohibition of abuse of rights (not a right per se, more of a provision against misuse)

Wait, the question is about which are not qualified rights, meaning which are absolute.

So from the options, E is Article 3, which is absolute. So the answer would be E.

Wait, but what about Article 12? I'm a bit fuzzy. Right to marry is in Article 12, I think. Is that a qualified right? Or is it absolute? I'm not entirely sure. Maybe it's absolute because it's a fundamental right, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps it's qualified, allowing states to impose some restrictions, like age requirements or consent. But I'm not 100% sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is that Articles 2, 3, 4, and maybe 7 (no punishment without law) are absolute. The others like 8,9,10,11 are qualified.

So the options are E (3) and possibly others. Looking back at the options, E is definitely an absolute right. So the answer should be E.

The question asks which of the listed articles are not qualified rights. Qualified rights can be subject to limitations under specific circumstances, while absolute rights cannot be restricted except in extreme cases.

- **Article 19**: Not directly relevant here, as it is not one of the core rights typically discussed in this context.
- **Article 11**: Freedom of assembly is a qualified right, as it can be limited for public safety, order, or other specified reasons.
- **Article 12**: The right to marry is generally considered an absolute right, as it is a fundamental right without typical limitations.
- **Article 9**: Freedom of thought, conscience, and religion is a qualified right, subject to limitations for public safety, order, health, or morals.
- **Article 3**: Prohibition of torture is an absolute right, as it cannot be justified under any circumstances.
- **Article 17**: This article is not a right but a provision against the abuse of rights, so it is not relevant to the question.

From the analysis, **Article 3 (E)** is an absolute right and therefore not a qualified right. 

Answer: E
