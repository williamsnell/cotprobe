Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically dealing with attorney-client privilege in a federal court case. Okay, let me think through this.

The question says that a national association sued a city in federal court, and the suit is about violating federal statutes. During the trial, the association's attorney called the city attorney as an adverse witness. The city attorney is asserting attorney-client privilege, saying the communications were confidential. The issue is about which law applies when resolving these objections.

Hmm, I remember that in federal courts, the admissibility of evidence is generally governed by the Federal Rules of Evidence. But wait, there's an exception for privileges. I think the Supreme Court case of United States v. Gillock comes into play here. Before that, I think federal courts used to apply the common law for privileges, but then there was a change.

Wait, no, more accurately, I think that for state law claims, federal courts might look to state privilege law, but when it's a federal question, like here where the case is based on federal statutes, the federal common law of privileges applies. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Wait, the Federal Rules of Evidence, specifically Rule 501, says that privilege issues are governed by the principles of the common law, except in cases where State law provides the rule of decision for an element of the claim or defense. So, in other words, if the case is based on state law, then state privilege law applies, but if it's federal, then federal common law applies.

In this question, the suit is about violating federal statutes, so it's a federal question case. Therefore, the privileges should be determined under federal common law. So the city attorney's assertion of attorney-client privilege would be evaluated under federal law, not the state where the city is located or where the association is from.

Let me look at the options:

Option G says federal privilege law. That seems to fit because it's a federal case based on federal statutes. So the federal court would use federal privilege law.

Wait, but wait another thought. I'm trying to remember if there's any nuance. For example, does the location of the parties matter? Like, is the city in a different state than where the national association is based? The question doesn't specify, but the options don't seem to account for that. So the main point is whether it's state or federal privilege law.

So in a federal question case, it's federal. So the correct answer is G: federal privilege law.

In this case, the suit is brought in federal court and involves charges of violating federal statutes, making it a federal question case. Under Federal Rule of Evidence 501, privileges in federal court are governed by federal common law when the case involves a federal question. Therefore, the city attorney's assertion of attorney-client privilege should be resolved under federal privilege law.

The correct answer is G.
