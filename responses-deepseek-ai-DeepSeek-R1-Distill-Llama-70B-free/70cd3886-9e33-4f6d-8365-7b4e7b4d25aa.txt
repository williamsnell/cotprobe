Question:

A widow owned an apartment building. Several years ago, a student, in a signed writing, entered a three-year lease agreement with the widow. The student agreed to pay $800 monthly rent for the third-floor apartment in the widow's building. The original three-year term had long since expired, but the student had continued to pay his rent, and the widow continued to accept it. If the widow had chosen to evict the student immediately upon the end of the three-year period, and before she had accepted the next rent check, the student's strongest argument to prevent eviction, if true, would have been that

Options:

A: the student had a right to stay as he had been residing there for more than three years.
B: the widow had not given the student requisitenotice for terminating a term of years.
C: the student had made improvements to the property, thus extending the leasehold.
D: the student had a verbal agreement with the widow to extend the lease.
E: the terms of the leasehold contract were binding on both parties.
F: the widow had accepted rent for the following month before the three-year period ended.
G: the student was protected from eviction due to his status as a student.
H: the widow had not clearly communicated the end of the lease term.
I: the widow had not given the student requisitenotice for terminating a periodic tenancy.
J: the leasehold contract was void ab initio.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about landlord-tenant law. Let me read the question again carefully.

The situation is that a widow owns an apartment building. A student entered into a three-year lease, signed writing, paying $800 monthly. The three years have expired, but the student kept paying rent, and the widow accepted it. Now, the widow wants to evict the student immediately after the three-year period ends, before she accepts the next rent check. The student's strongest argument to prevent eviction would be what?

Hmm, I remember that when a lease ends, what happens next depends on the type of tenancy that follows. If the lease is for a fixed term, like three years, and after that term, the tenant stays and the landlord accepts rent, it usually creates a new type of tenancy.

Wait, there's something about tenancy at will, periodic tenancy, and holdover tenancy. Let me think. When a fixed-term lease ends and the tenant stays with the landlord's consent, it typically becomes a periodic tenancy. The terms are usually month-to-month if the rent is paid monthly, or year-to-year if paid annually.

So in this case, the original lease was three years, and after that, the student continued paying monthly rent, which the widow accepted. That probably creates a month-to-month periodic tenancy.

Now, the widow wants to evict the student right after the three years, before accepting the next rent. So she's trying to end the tenancy. But under a periodic tenancy, both parties have to give proper notice to terminate. For a month-to-month tenancy, typically, the landlord needs to give a 30-day notice, or whatever the state law requires, before eviction.

If the widow tried to evict the student without giving the required notice, the student could argue that the eviction is improper because the widow didn't provide the necessary notice for terminating a periodic tenancy. 

Looking at the options:

Option I says: the widow had not given the student requisite notice for terminating a periodic tenancy. That sounds right because the student is now on a month-to-month tenancy, and the landlord needs to give proper notice to end it.

Option B says the widow didn't give notice for terminating a term of years, but the term already ended, so that's not applicable anymore. The lease was for three years, which has expired, so they're beyond that term.

Option F mentions accepting rent after the three-year period. But the question says she hasn't accepted the next check yet. So F isn't the case here.

Option E says the lease terms are binding, but the lease ended, so that's not it.

So I think the correct answer is I.

The correct answer is I. After the fixed three-year lease expired, the student and widow entered into a month-to-month periodic tenancy by the student continuing to pay rent and the widow accepting it. To terminate a periodic tenancy, the landlord must provide proper notice, which the widow failed to do before attempting eviction.
