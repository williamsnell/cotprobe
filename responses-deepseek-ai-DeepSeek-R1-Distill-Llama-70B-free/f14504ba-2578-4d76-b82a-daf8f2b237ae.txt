Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the function of oxygen in the body. Let me think through this carefully.

The question is asking what function oxygen serves. I remember that oxygen is crucial for cellular respiration. Cellular respiration is the process where cells break down glucose to produce energy, which is stored as ATP. There are a few stages in this process, like glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain. Oxygen is a key player in the third stage, I think. Without oxygen, the process can't complete, and that's why we need to breathe.

Looking at the options:

Option A says oxygen maintains cell temperature. Hmm, I don't think that's right. I remember that during cellular respiration, some energy is released as heat, but I don't think oxygen's role is specifically to maintain temperature.

Option B mentions producing alcohol. Oh, wait, that's fermentation, right? And fermentation happens when there's no oxygen. So that's the opposite situation. So B is probably wrong.

Option C is about producing carbon dioxide. Well, carbon dioxide is a byproduct of cellular respiration, but is oxygen used to produce it? Or is it more that oxygen is a necessary component for the process that leads to CO2? So I think the statement in C is correct in a way, but maybe not the best answer.

Option D says oxygen is solely responsible for brain activity. That doesn't sound right. I mean, the brain uses a lot of oxygen, but saying it's solely responsible is probably an overstatement.

Option E is about synthesizing proteins. I don't think oxygen is directly involved in protein synthesis. That process more involves amino acids, RNA, ribosomes, etc.

Option F says oxygen converts glucose directly into energy without processes. That can't be right because cellular respiration has several steps, and it's a metabolic process. So F is incorrect.

Option G states oxygen is necessary for cellular respiration. That fits with what I was thinking earlier. Oxygen is a reactant in the electron transport chain, which is a part of aerobic respiration. Without it, the process can't proceed efficiently.

Option H is about photosynthesis. Wait, photosynthesis is done by plants, algae, and some bacteria. It's the process where they make glucose using sunlight, CO2, and H2O. Humans don't do photosynthesis, so H isn't relevant here.

Option I says oxygen breaks down nutrients in digestion. No, that's more about digestive enzymes and acids in the stomach, not oxygen directly.

Option J talks about oxygen as a lubricant. That doesn't make sense. Lubrication is more about fluids and substances like synovial fluid in joints, not oxygen.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be G: Oxygen is necessary for the process of cellular respiration.

The correct answer is G: Oxygen is necessary for the process of cellular respiration.

Answer: G
