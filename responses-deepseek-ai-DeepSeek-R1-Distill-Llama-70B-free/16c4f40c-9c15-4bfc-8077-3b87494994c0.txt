Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about the dissociation of HI into hydrogen and iodine. Hmm, the problem says that the equilibrium constant Kc is 21 at a certain temperature. I remember that Kc is calculated using the concentrations of the products and reactants at equilibrium.

The question is asking for the molar concentration of iodine vapor when 15 grams of HI is introduced into a 12.0-liter flask and allowed to reach equilibrium. Right, so I think I need to set up an ICE table for this. ICE stands for Initial, Change, Equilibrium. That's the standard approach for these kinds of problems.

First, I need to find out the initial concentration of HI. They gave the mass as 15 grams. The molar mass of HI... Let's think. Hydrogen is about 1 g/mol and iodine is around 127 g/mol. So together that's 128 g/mol. 

So moles of HI would be mass divided by molar mass. 15 grams divided by 128 g/mol. Let me calculate that: 15 / 128 is approximately 0.1172 moles. Since the volume is 12 liters, the concentration is moles over volume. So 0.1172 moles / 12 L = about 0.00977 M. Wait, but maybe I should be more precise with the calculation.

Wait, wait, 15 divided by 128 is exactly 15/128. Let me compute that. 128 into 15. 128 * 0.1 is 12.8. So 15-12.8 is 2.2. 2.2 /128 is 0.0171875. So adding up, 0.1 + 0.0171875 = 0.1171875 moles. Then divided by 12 L gives 0.0097656 M, approximately 0.0097656 M.

So initial concentration of HI is 0.0097656 M. The initial concentrations of H2 and I2 are zero because no products are present initially.

Now, the dissociation reaction is HI ⇌ H2 + I2. So for every mole of HI that dissociates, it produces one mole of H2 and one mole of I2. So the change would be -x for HI, and +x for each product.

So the equilibrium concentrations would be [HI] = 0.0097656 - x, [H2] = x, [I2] = x.

Wait, but the problem is that Kc is given as 21. So let's write the equilibrium expression. 

Kc = ([H2][I2]) / [HI] 

Plugging in the equilibrium concentrations: (x * x) / (0.0097656 - x) = 21.

So that becomes x² / (0.0097656 - x) = 21.

Hmm, that leads to a quadratic equation. Let's rearrange it:

x² = 21 * (0.0097656 - x)
x² = 0.2051076 - 21x
Bring all terms to one side:
x² +21x -0.2051076 =0.

Wait, wait, no. Let me check. 

Wait, expanding 21*(0.0097656 -x) is 0.2051076 -21x. So moving everything to left, x² +21x -0.2051076 = 0.

But wait, that can't be right because the quadratic term is positive, and the equation would have a positive solution. Let me think about whether I made a mistake in setting up the equation.

Wait, wait. The original setup: Kc = x²/(0.0097656 - x) =21. So x² =21*(0.0097656 -x). So x² =21*(0.0097656) -21x. So x² +21x - (21 * 0.0097656) =0.

Compute 21 * 0.0097656. Let's see: 0.0097656 *20 is 0.195312, plus 0.0097656 is 0.2050776. So about 0.2050776.

So the equation is x² +21x -0.2050776 =0.

Wait, but using the quadratic formula, x = [-b ± sqrt(b² +4ac)]/(2a). Because the equation is ax² +bx +c=0. In this case, a=1, b=21, c= -0.2050776.

So discriminant D = b² -4ac. Wait, no, because the equation is x² +21x -0.2050776=0, so a=1, b=21, c= -0.2050776. So D= (21)^2 -4*1*(-0.2050776) = 441 + 0.8203104 = 441.8203104.

Square root of D is sqrt(441.8203104). Let me compute that. Well, sqrt(441) is 21, and sqrt(441.8203) is a bit more, maybe 21.02 or something. Let's see, 21.02 squared is (21 +0.02)^2 =21² +2*21*0.02 +0.02²=441 +0.84 +0.0004=441.8404. Hmm, but D is 441.8203, which is a bit less than that. So maybe 21.02 is a little high, perhaps 21.01? Let's compute 21.01^2: 21^2=441, 2*21*0.01=0.42, 0.01^2=0.0001. So 441 +0.42 +0.0001=441.4201. Hmm, wait no, 21.01^2 is 21^2 + 2*21*0.01 +0.01^2 =441 +0.42 +0.0001=441.4201. But our D is 441.8203, which is higher than 441.42, so the square root should be between 21.01 and 21.02.

Wait, maybe I should just compute it numerically.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to proceed with the quadratic formula.

So x = [-21 ± sqrt(441.8203)] / 2.

Since concentrations can't be negative, we'll take the positive root.

So sqrt(441.8203)= approx 21.02 (as before, maybe 21.016 or something, but perhaps I can compute it more accurately).

Alternatively, perhaps I can use an approximate method. Let me see: 21^2=441, so 21.01^2=441.42 (as before). 21.01^2=441.42, D is 441.8203.

So the difference is 441.8203 -441.42=0.4003. So how much more beyond 21.01 do we need to go to get an additional 0.4003 in the square.

Let me model it as (21.01 + delta)^2 =441.8203. Expanding, 21.01² +2*21.01*delta + delta²=441.8203.

We know 21.01²=441.4201, so 441.4201 +42.02*delta +delta²=441.8203.

Subtracting, 42.02 *delta + delta²=0.4002. Since delta will be small, delta squared is negligible, so approx 42.02*delta≈0.4002 → delta≈0.4002/42.02 ≈0.00952.

So sqrt(D)≈21.01 +0.00952=21.01952.

So x= [ -21 +21.01952 ] / 2 = (0.01952)/2=0.00976 M.

Wait, so x is approximately 0.00976 M. That would be the concentration of I2, same as H2.

Wait, but let me double-check. Let's plug x back into the Kc expression to see if it makes sense.

So [HI] at equilibrium is (0.0097656 - x) = 0.0097656 -0.00976 ≈0.0000056 M. That's a very small number, almost negligible.

So Kc should be (x^2)/[HI] = (0.00976^2)/(0.0000056) ≈ (0.0000953)/(0.0000056) ≈ 17. So wait, but Kc is supposed to be 21. Hmm, so my approximation might be a bit off.

Maybe I should use a more precise method. Alternatively, perhaps the assumption that x is much smaller than the initial concentration isn't valid here. Oh wait, wait a second. The initial concentration of HI is about 0.00976 M, and the change is x. But if x is around 0.00976, that would mean that HI is almost completely dissociated. Because 0.00976 is almost equal to the initial concentration of HI, so [HI] becomes 0.0000056, which is very small.

Wait, but let's think about this. If Kc is 21, which is quite large, that suggests that the reaction favors products, so HI would dissociate significantly. So my initial assumption that x is much smaller than initial concentration might not hold. So perhaps I should not make the assumption and should solve the quadratic accurately.

Let me go back to the quadratic equation: x² +21x -0.2050776=0.

Using the quadratic formula:

x = [-21 ± sqrt(21² +4*1*0.2050776)] / (2*1).

Wait, wait, the equation is x² +21x -0.2050776=0. So a=1, b=21, c=-0.2050776. So discriminant D= b² -4ac =21² -4*1*(-0.2050776) =441 +0.8203104=441.8203104.

So sqrt(D)=sqrt(441.8203104)=21.0195 (as before).

So x = [-21 +21.0195]/2 = (0.0195)/2=0.00975 M.

Wait, that's the same result as before. So the concentration of I2 is 0.00975 M, which is approximately 0.00975 mol/L.

But wait, looking at the answer options, option B is 2.1 mol/L, which is way too big. Option C is 4.58, which is even bigger. Option H is 0.015, which is bigger than our x. So maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait a minute, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial setup. Let me double-check.

Wait, the reaction is HI ⇌ H2 + I2. So Kc = [H2][I2]/[HI] = x²/(0.0097656 -x) =21.

But wait, maybe the initial concentration of HI is higher than I thought. Let me recalculate the moles of HI.

15 grams of HI. The molar mass of HI is 1.008 (H) + 126.904 (I), so approximately 127.912 g/mol.

So moles of HI = 15 /127.912 ≈0.1172 moles. Then concentration is 0.1172 /12=0.009766 M. So that part was correct.

Hmm, but when I plug in x as 0.00975, [HI] becomes 0.0000056 M, which is 5.6e-6 M. Then Kc would be (0.00975)^2 /5.6e-6 ≈ (9.5e-5)/5.6e-6 ≈17, which is less than 21. So perhaps x is higher than 0.00975.

Wait, maybe I should not have approximated and instead solve the quadratic more accurately. Let me try using more precise numbers.

Let me compute the quadratic formula again more precisely.

x = [ -21 + sqrt(441.8203104) ] / 2.

Wait, sqrt(441.8203104) is approximately 21.0195, as before.

So x= ( -21 +21.0195 ) /2 = 0.0195/2 =0.00975 M.

But wait, when I plug x=0.00975 into Kc, I get Kc= (0.00975)^2 / (0.009766 -0.00975) = (0.00009506) / (0.000016) ≈5.953, which is way below 21. So something's wrong here.

Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me compute that denominator again.

Wait, 0.009766 -0.00975 = 0.000016 M. So [HI]=0.000016.

Then (0.00975)^2 = approx 0.00009506.

So 0.00009506 /0.000016 = approx 5.953. That's way lower than Kc=21, so that can't be right.

Hmm, so perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equation. Wait, maybe I should have considered that the molarity is lower because the volume is 12 liters. Alternatively, perhaps I should have made the assumption that x is small compared to the initial concentration, but in this case, that doesn't hold because Kc is large.

Wait, the correct approach when Kc is large is to assume that the reaction goes almost to completion. So in this case, HI would dissociate almost completely. So the initial concentration is 0.009766 M. Let's say that x is approximately equal to 0.009766. But then, [HI] would be 0.009766 - x ≈0. So I can't ignore x in the denominator. So I need to solve the equation accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I should let s be the amount that dissociates, so:

Initial: [HI] = 0.009766, [H2]=0, [I2]=0.

Change: [HI] decreases by s, [H2]=s, [I2]=s.

Equilibrium: [HI] = 0.009766 -s, [H2]=s, [I2]=s.

So Kc= (s^2)/(0.009766 -s) =21.

So s^2 =21*(0.009766 -s) → s^2 =0.205206 -21s → s^2 +21s -0.205206=0.

Solving this quadratic equation:

s = [-21 ± sqrt(21^2 +4*1*0.205206)] /2.

Compute discriminant D=441 +0.820824=441.820824.

sqrt(D)=21.0195 (approx).

So s= [ -21 +21.0195 ] /2 =0.0195/2=0.00975 M.

Wait, but as before, this leads to Kc= (0.00975)^2 / (0.009766-0.00975)=0.00009506 /0.000016≈5.95, which is less than 21, so that can't be right.

Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake in the setup. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that when Kc is large, the amount of HI that remains is negligible, so 0.009766 -s ≈s, but that might not be the case.

Wait, another approach: when Kc is large, we can assume that s is approximately equal to the initial concentration. But let's check. The initial [HI] is 0.009766. If s is approximately 0.009766, then [HI] is 0.009766 -s ≈0. So the expression becomes s² / 0. But that's undefined, which suggests that s is close to 0.009766, but not exactly.

Wait, perhaps I should use the approximation and adjust. Let me let s =0.009766 - y, where y is small. Then, [HI] = y, and [H2] = [I2]=0.009766 - y ≈0.009766.

So Kc= [H2][I2]/[HI] ≈ (0.009766)^2 / y =21.

So y≈ (0.009766)^2 /21 ≈ (9.53e-5)/21 ≈4.536e-6.

So s=0.009766 - y ≈0.009766 -0.000004536≈0.0097615.

So [I2]=s≈0.0097615 M. That would make Kc= (0.0097615)^2 / (4.536e-6) ≈ (9.52e-5)/4.536e-6≈21, which fits.

So the concentration of I2 is approximately 0.00976 M, which is 0.00976 mol/L.

Looking at the options, let's see. Option E is 0.00687, option B is 2.1, option H is 0.015. Wait, none of these match 0.00976. Oh wait, option F is 9.76e-3, which is 0.00976 M. So that would be option F.

Wait, but let me check. Option F is 9.76 × 10^-3 M, which is 0.00976 M. So that's our answer. So the correct option is F.
</think>

To solve the problem, we start by calculating the initial concentration of HI. The molar mass of HI is approximately 127.91 g/mol. Given 15 grams of HI, the number of moles is:

\[
\text{Moles of HI} = \frac{15}{127.91} \approx 0.1172 \, \text{moles}.
\]

The volume of the flask is 12.0 L, so the initial concentration of HI is:

\[
[HI]_{\text{initial}} = \frac{0.1172}{12.0} \approx 0.009766 \, \text{M}.
\]

The dissociation reaction is:

\[
HI \, \rightleftharpoons \, H_2 + I_2.
\]

Using an ICE table, the equilibrium concentrations are:

- \([HI] = 0.009766 - x\),
- \([H_2] = x\),
- \([I_2] = x\).

The equilibrium constant expression is:

\[
K_c = \frac{[H_2][I_2]}{[HI]} = \frac{x^2}{0.009766 -
