Question:

Jones is arrested for driving under the influence of a controlled substance, marijuana. The prosecution wishes to introduce a videotape from a pot party Jones left just before his arrest. The recording shows Jones exhaling a giant cloud of smoke and stating, "that's really great weed, man." Jones testifies on his own behalf, "I'm an honest person. I absolutely did not drive erratically." On cross-examination, the prosecutor asks, "Isn't it true you lied in your divorce trial last year?" If Jones' attorney objects, the court will likely hold the prosecutor's question is

Options:

A: Admissible because the question goes to Jones' credibility as a witness.
B: Admissible, as it relates to the case at hand.
C: Admissible, so long as the prosecutor produces a certified copy of the conviction.
D: Admissible, because it showcases Jones' character.
E: Not admissible, because specific instances of conduct cannot be proved with extrinsic evidence.
F: Not admissible, as it is considered hearsay.
G: Admissible, because it demonstrates Jones' dishonesty.
H: Not admissible because it is irrelevant.
I: Not admissible, because it is prejudicial to the defendant.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically dealing with cross-examination and the admissibility of certain questions. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is about Jones being arrested for driving under the influence of marijuana. The prosecution wants to introduce a videotape from a pot party Jones attended just before his arrest. The video shows him exhaling smoke and making a statement about the weed. Then, Jones testifies on his own behalf, claiming he's honest and didn't drive erratically.

On cross-examination, the prosecutor asks if Jones lied in his divorce trial last year. The defense attorney objects, and the question is whether this is admissible.

I remember that when a witness testifies, their credibility can be attacked on cross-examination. One of the ways to do this is by asking about prior convictions or specific instances of conduct that show dishonesty. But wait, there's a rule about this. I think it's Federal Rule of Evidence 608, which deals with the credibility of a witness.

So, under FRE 608(b), specific instances of a witness's conduct cannot be proved by extrinsic evidence. That means the prosecutor can ask about the conduct on cross-examination but can't bring in other evidence (like documents or other witnesses) to prove it. So, if the prosecutor asks the question, Jones can deny it, and the prosecutor can't present evidence to show that Jones actually lied in his divorce trial.

In this question, the prosecutor is asking about a specific instance of conduct (lying in the divorce trial). But there's no mention of a conviction, just an allegation. So, the question is about whether the question itself is admissible, not whether extrinsic evidence is being used.

Wait, the options mention things like whether extrinsic evidence is needed or not. Option E says it's not admissible because specific instances can't be proved with extrinsic evidence. But in this case, the prosecutor is just asking the question; they're not introducing extrinsic evidence. So, the question itself is allowed under 608(b), right? Because 608(b) allows the question on cross-examination but prohibits extrinsic evidence to prove it.

Wait, no. Let me clarify. FRE 608(b) says that specific instances of conduct cannot be proved by extrinsic evidence. So, you can ask the question on cross-examination, but you can't bring in other evidence to prove it. So, the question is admissible because it's about credibility, but extrinsic evidence isn't allowed.

Looking back at the options:

A: Admissible because it goes to credibility. That's true because it's about honesty.

B: Admissible as it relates to the case. Hmm, not sure. The case is about DUI, so past lying might not relate directly.

C: Admissible if prosecutor produces a certified copy. That's about extrinsic evidence, which isn't allowed here. So C is incorrect.

D: Admissible because it's about character. Wait, but 608(b) is about specific conduct, not character traits. So it's more about credibility through specific acts.

E: Not admissible because specific instances can't be proved with extrinsic evidence. Wait, but the question is about asking, not introducing evidence. So E is talking about extrinsic evidence, which isn't the issue here. So the question itself is allowed.

F: Not admissible as hearsay. The question is not offered for the truth of the matter; it's to impeach credibility. So hearsay isn't the issue here.

G: Admissible because it shows dishonesty. That aligns with 608(b), which allows asking about specific dishonest acts.

H: Not admissible because irrelevant. No, it's relevant to credibility.

I: Not admissible because it's prejudicial. While it might be prejudicial, the rule allows it unless the court finds it's more prejudicial than probative.

So back to the question. The prosecutor is asking about a specific instance of conduct (lying in a prior trial) to attack credibility. Under FRE 608(b), that's allowed on cross-examination. So the question is admissible because it goes to credibility.

Looking at the options, A and G seem to suggest it's admissible. But wait, what's the exact rule? 608(b) says you can't prove the conduct with extrinsic evidence. So the question is allowed, but you can't introduce evidence to prove it. So the question is admissible.

Wait, but looking at the answer options, option E says it's not admissible because specific instances can't be proved with extrinsic evidence. But the question is about the admissibility of the question, not the evidence. So the question should be allowed, making options A or G correct.

Wait, but the options might be tricky. Another angle: whether the specific act can be inquired into. FRE 608(b) allows the examiner to ask about the specific conduct, regardless of whether it resulted in a conviction. So the question is proper.

So, the correct answer should be that the question is admissible because it goes to credibility. So option A or G.

Wait, but option G says it's admissible because it demonstrates dishonesty. That's correct, but so does option A, which says it's about credibility.

Wait, but I think option E is a trap. Because the rule says you can't bring in extrinsic evidence, but the question is about the question being asked, not about evidence. So the question is allowed. So the correct answer is that it's admissible, which would be options A, B, C, D, or G.

Wait, but the question is whether the court will hold the prosecutor's question is admissible. So the question is admissible because it's about credibility, so option A. But wait, option E says it's not admissible because extrinsic evidence can't be used, but the question is about the question, not the evidence. So the question is allowed.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the issue. Let me think again. The rule is that specific instances of conduct (like lying in a prior trial) can be asked on cross-examination to attack credibility, but you can't bring in evidence (like a transcript from the divorce trial) to prove that the witness lied. So the question is allowed, making the prosecutor's question admissible.

So the correct answer is that the question is admissible because it goes to credibility. So the answer would be A. But another angle: is the specific instance too remote? The question is about a divorce trial last year. I think the time isn't a bar here.

Wait, another point: FRE 608(b) says that specific instances can be inquired into on cross-examination but can't be proved by extrinsic evidence. So the question is permissible. So the answer should be admissible, so options A, B, C, D, G.

Looking at the options:

A: Admissible because question goes to credibility. Correct, because it's about honesty.

G: Admissible because it shows dishonesty. Also correct.

Wait, but both A and G seem correct. Hmm. Wait, what's the difference? Option A is about credibility in general, G is about showing dishonesty. I think both are correct, but perhaps A is broader.

Wait, but the question is whether the court will hold the question is admissible. So the reasoning is that it's allowed under 608(b) for credibility, so A is correct.

Wait, but let me check the options again. Option E says not admissible because specific instances can't be proved with extrinsic evidence. But the question is about the admissibility of the question, not the evidence. So E is about evidence, not the question. So E is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct answer is A: Admissible because the question goes to Jones' credibility as a witness.
</think>

The question revolves around the admissibility of a prosecutor's inquiry into whether Jones lied during his divorce trial, which is being used to attack Jones' credibility on cross-examination. Under Federal Rule of Evidence 608(b), specific instances of a witness's conduct can be inquired into on cross-examination to challenge credibility, but such conduct cannot be proven through extrinsic evidence. Here, the prosecutor's question is about a specific instance of alleged dishonesty (lying in a prior trial), which is permissible under the rule.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Correct. The question is admissible because it goes to Jones' credibility as a witness, which is a proper purpose under FRE 608(b).
- **B**: Incorrect. The question does not relate directly to the case at hand (DUI), but rather to Jones' credibility.
- **C**: Incorrect. The admissibility of the question does not depend on producing a certified copy of a conviction, as the question itself is allowed under FRE 608(b).
- **D**: Incorrect. The question is not about Jones' character but rather about his credibility through specific conduct.
- **E**: Incorrect. This option confuses the issue by focusing on extrinsic evidence, which is not at play here. The question itself is admissible.
- **F**: Incorrect. The question is not hearsay because it is not offered for the truth of the matter asserted but to impeach credibility.
- **G**: Also correct. The question is admissible because it demonstrates dishonesty, which aligns with FRE 608(b).
- **H**: Incorrect. The question is relevant to Jones' credibility, making it admissible.
- **I**: Incorrect. While the question may be prejudicial, it is still admissible under FRE 608(b).

Between **A** and **G**, both are correct, but **A** is broader and more directly addresses the admissibility of the question based on credibility. Therefore, the best answer is:

**A: Admissible because the question goes to Jones' credibility as a witness.**
