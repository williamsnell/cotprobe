Question:

Fernandez is planning to attend an auction of the assets of Cross & Black, one of his major competitors who is liquidating. In the conduct of the auction, which of the following rules applies?

Options:

A: Such a sale is without reserve unless the goods are explicitly put up with reserve.
B: A bidder may retract his bid at any time until the falling of the hammer.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this auction question. Let me think. The question is about what rule applies when Fernandez is attending an auction of Cross & Black's assets. They're liquidating, so it's probably an auction without reserve, but I'm not sure.

The options are A through D. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A: Such a sale is without reserve unless the goods are explicitly put up with reserve. Hmm. I remember that in auctions, if it's without reserve, the item must be sold to the highest bidder. But I think the default is that sales are with reserve unless stated otherwise. Wait, no, I think it's the opposite. If the auction is without reserve, the auctioneer has to sell to the highest bidder regardless of the price. But is that the default? Or does the auctioneer have the right to withdraw the item unless it's specifically without reserve?

Option B: A bidder may retract his bid at any time until the falling of the hammer. I think that's not right. I remember something about a bidder not being able to retract once the auction has started. Or maybe they can, but perhaps it's subject to certain rules. Or maybe it's the auctioneer who can withdraw the item, not the bidder retracting.

Option C: The retraction of a bid by a bidder revives the previous bid. I'm not too sure about this. If someone retracts their bid, does it mean the next highest bid stands? I think that's the case. Like, if the current highest bidder pulls out, the next one in line is considered. So maybe this is correct, but I'm not certain if it's one of the rules for this particular scenario.

Option D: If the auction is without reserve, the auctioneer can withdraw the article at any time prior to the fall of the hammer. Wait, if it's without reserve, doesn't that mean the auctioneer can't withdraw it? Because without reserve means they have to sell it. So I think this is incorrect. The auctioneer can only withdraw if it's with reserve. So option D is probably wrong.

Let me go back to option A. If the auction is without reserve unless explicitly stated otherwise, that would mean that most auctions are with reserve. But I thought the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) says that when an auction is conducted, it's without reserve unless specified. Wait, no, I think it's the other way around. The auction is with reserve unless the auctioneer states it's without reserve. Because normally, the seller (here, Cross & Black) would want to have the option to withdraw if the bidding isn't high enough.

So if the auction is without reserve, the auctioneer can't withdraw the item. So looking at the options, option D says that in an auction without reserve, the auctioneer can withdraw. That can't be right because without reserve means they have to sell it. So D is wrong.

So which option is correct? Let's think again.

Option A says the sale is without reserve unless the goods are explicitly put up with reserve. Wait no, that would mean most sales are without reserve, which doesn't seem right. I think the default is that the auction is with reserve, so the auctioneer can withdraw unless stated otherwise. So option A would be incorrect because it says the opposite.

Option B: Bidder can retract any time until the hammer falls. I think that's not correct. Once the auction starts, I believe a bidder can't retract their bid without consequences. Or maybe they can, but it's not a rule that applies here. I'm not sure about this one.

Option C: Retraction revives the previous bid. That makes sense. If the highest bidder pulls out, the next highest is considered. So if this is a general rule, then perhaps C is correct.

Wait, but the question is about which rule applies in the conduct of the auction. So which of these is a correct rule.

Let me try to remember. Under the UCC, when goods are put up for auction, the sale is with reserve unless the auctioneer indicates that it's without reserve. So the default is with reserve, meaning the seller can withdraw the goods if not satisfied with the bids.

So looking at option A, it says the sale is without reserve unless explicitly with reserve. That would mean the opposite of the UCC rule. So A is incorrect.

So the correct rules would be: 

- Auctions are with reserve unless stated otherwise (so A is wrong).
- The auctioneer can withdraw the item if it's with reserve, which is the default.
- If a bidder retracts, the previous bid may be considered.

Wait, but the question is about which rule applies in the auction. Let's look at the options again.

Option D: If without reserve, auctioneer can withdraw. That's wrong because without reserve means they can't.

Option B: Bidder can retract any time until the hammer. I think that's not allowed. Once you bid, you're bound until the hammer falls. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Retraction revives previous bid. That seems correct. Because if the current highest bidder withdraws, the next one is back on.

So perhaps C is the correct answer.

Wait, but wait. The question is about the rule that applies in the conduct of the auction. So what are the general rules.

Another approach: in an auction with reserve, the auctioneer can withdraw the item if the bids are not satisfactory. So the auction is with reserve unless without reserve is announced.

So for option D, it's incorrect because if the auction is without reserve, the auctioneer cannot withdraw.

So the correct answer must be either C or A.

Wait, maybe the question is about which option is a correct rule, regardless of whether the auction is with or without reserve.

So let's think again.

Option A: Sale is without reserve unless explicitly with reserve. As per UCC, the default is with reserve. So A is incorrect.

Option B: Bidder can retract at any time. No, I think a bidder can't retract once the auction has started. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Retraction revives previous bid. Yes, that's correct. If the highest bidder retracts, the next highest becomes the current bid.

Option D: Without reserve, auctioneer can withdraw. No, because without reserve means they can't.

So the correct answer is option C.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure. In the auction, if a bidder retracts, does the previous bid stand? I think so. So the correct answer is C.

To determine the correct rule that applies in the conduct of the auction, let us analyze each option:

- **Option A**: "Such a sale is without reserve unless the goods are explicitly put up with reserve." This is incorrect because, under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), the default rule is that auctions are conducted *with reserve* unless the auctioneer explicitly states that the sale is without reserve. Therefore, this statement contradicts the default rule.

- **Option B**: "A bidder may retract his bid at any time until the falling of the hammer." This is also incorrect. Once a bid is made, the bidder is generally bound by it and cannot retract it without consequences. Retraction is not typically allowed after the auction has started.

- **Option C**: "The retraction of a bid by a bidder revives the previous bid." This is correct. If the highest bidder retracts their bid, the next highest bid becomes the current bid. This is a standard rule in auction proceedings.

- **Option D**: "If the auction is without reserve, the auctioneer can withdraw the article at any time prior to the fall of the hammer." This is incorrect. If the auction is explicitly conducted without reserve, the auctioneer is obligated to sell the item to the highest bidder and cannot withdraw it.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is **Option C**, as it accurately reflects a rule that applies in the conduct of an auction.
