Okay, so I have this car rental problem to solve. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to this, so I might take it slow and make sure I understand each part.

The question is asking about the cost of renting a compact car for 2 days and 4 hours, and driving 364 miles. The car rental schedule has different rates, so I need to figure out which ones apply here.

First, looking at the schedule, there are different car types: Compact, Standard, and Luxury. The problem is about Compact, so I'll focus there.

The Compact car rates are as follows:

- Rate per Day: $12.00
- Rate per Week: $60.00
- Extra Hours: $2.75 per hour over 24
- Mileage: $0.14 per mile, gas included.

Also, there's a minimum charge which is the 24-hour rate. Insurance is extra: Collision at $1.20 per day and Liability at $1.20 per day. But wait, the problem doesn't mention insurance, so maybe it's not included in the cost here. The question is only about the rental cost, so maybe I can ignore insurance unless it's a mandatory charge. Hmm, the problem statement doesn't specify whether insurance is included or not, so I'll proceed without adding it unless I have to. Maybe I'll check that later.

So, the rental duration is 2 days and 4 hours. Let me convert that into days and hours to apply the rates. 

One day is 24 hours, so 2 days would be 48 hours. Adding 4 hours makes it 52 hours in total. 

Now, the car rental has different charges based on duration. The rates are per day (which I think is a 24-hour period) and an hourly rate for extra hours beyond that. So, for the first 24 hours, it's the daily rate, and any time beyond that is charged at the hourly rate.

Wait, but the schedule says "Rate per Day" and "Rate for Extra Hours" as $2.75 per hour over 24. So, for every hour beyond the initial 24-hour period, they charge $2.75. 

So, let's calculate the time charges first.

Total time rented: 2 days and 4 hours = 52 hours.

The first 24 hours: that's 1 day. So, the first day is $12.00.

Then, we have 52 - 24 = 28 hours remaining. Wait, no, because 2 days would be 48 hours. So the initial 24 hours is day one. Then, the next 24 hours is day two. Wait, but the total is 52 hours, which is 2 days (48 hours) plus 4 hours. So, the first 24 hours: $12. The next 24 hours (day 2) would be another $12, right? Then, the remaining 4 hours would be extra, charged at $2.75 per hour.

So, time charges would be:

- Day 1: $12.00
- Day 2: $12.00
- Extra 4 hours: 4 * $2.75 = $11.00

Wait, but wait a minute. Alternatively, maybe the first 24 hours is considered as one day, and any additional time beyond that, even if it's another full day, is charged as extra hours. Or is each day beyond the first 24 hours charged as a full day? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the "Rate per Day" is $12.00. So, for each full day (24 hours), it's $12. But if you go beyond a full day, the extra hours are charged at $2.75 per hour beyond 24. So, for example, if you rent for 30 hours, that's 1 day (24h) + 6h extra, so 6 * $2.75.

So in our case, 52 hours total.

First 24h: $12.

Remaining 28 hours: 28 hours beyond the first 24. Wait, no, no. Because after the first 24, the next 24 would be a second day, but perhaps the 2 days are charged at $12 each, and any hours beyond that are extra.

Wait, perhaps another approach is better. Let's think in terms of days and hours beyond the full days.

The total time is 52 hours. 

Each day is 24 hours. So, how many full days are in 52 hours?

52 /24 is approximately 2.1667 days. So, two full days (48 hours) and 4 extra hours.

So, the charges would be:

- 2 days at $12 each: 2 * $12 = $24.

- 4 extra hours: 4 * $2.75 = $11.

So, total time charges: $24 + $11 = $35.

Wait, but wait, another way is that the first day is 24h at $12, and any time beyond that is charged per hour. So 52h would be:

- 24h: $12.

- Remaining 28h: 28 * $2.75 = $77.

But that would make the time charges $12 + $77 = $89, which seems high. But that can't be right because the options don't go that high. So perhaps the initial approach is correct: that each full day beyond the first is charged at the daily rate, and any partial days are charged by the hour.

Wait, the problem states "Rate per Day" and "Rate for Extra Hours" as $2.75 per hour over 24. So perhaps it's structured as follows: The minimum is the 24-hour rate (so at least one day's charge). For any time beyond 24 hours, each additional hour beyond the initial 24 is charged at $2.75, regardless of how many full days beyond that. So, for 52 hours, the charge would be:

- 24h: $12.

- 52 -24 = 28h extra: 28 * $2.75.

Wait, 28 * 2.75: let's compute that.

2.75 * 28: 2.75 * 20 = 55, 2.75 *8=22, so total 77. So $12 + $77 = $89 for time charges. But looking at the options, none of them are that high except maybe option G is 125, but that's including mileage. Hmm, but 89 is way higher than the options given. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the rate structure.

Wait, perhaps the "Rate per Day" is for each 24-hour period, and any time beyond that within the same day is charged as extra hours. So for each full day (24h), it's $12. Then, any extra hours beyond the full days are charged at $2.75 per hour.

So for 52 hours:

Number of full days: 52 /24 = 2 full days (48h) and 4h extra.

So, time charges: 2 * $12 = $24.

Plus 4h * $2.75 = $11.

Total time charges: $24 + $11 = $35.

That makes more sense. So the time charges are $35.

Wait, but another point: the minimum charge is the 24-hour rate, which is $12. So even if you rent for less than 24 hours, you still get charged for a full day. But in this case, we have more than 24, so that's fine.

Next, the mileage charge. The car is driven 364 miles. The mileage rate is $0.14 per mile. So:

364 miles * $0.14/mile.

Let me compute that. 364 * 0.14.

Let me compute 364 * 0.1 = 36.4, and 364 * 0.04 = 14.56. So total is 36.4 +14.56 = 50.96.

So mileage charge is $50.96.

Now, adding the time and mileage charges: $35 + $50.96 = $85.96. Hmm, looking at the options, I see option C is $84.96, F is $86.40, J is $93.16. So $85.96 isn't an option. Did I make a mistake in calculations?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the mileage. Let me recalculate 364 * 0.14.

Alternatively, 364 * 0.14:

Break it down: 300 * 0.14 = 42, 64 * 0.14 = 8.96. So 42 +8.96=50.96. That's correct.

So time is $35, mileage $50.96, total $85.96.

Wait, but none of the options match. So perhaps I made a mistake in the time charges.

Let me re-examine the time calculation. The total time is 2 days and 4 hours, which is 52 hours.

Alternatively, perhaps the "Rate per Day" is applied to each 24-hour period, and any part of the next day is considered an extra day. Wait, but the extra hours are charged per hour beyond 24. So for 52 hours, the first 24h is $12, then the next 24h is another day, so another $12, making it $24 for 48h, and then 4h extra at $2.75 each, which is $11. So total time is $35, as before.

So that would make the total time $35, mileage $50.96: total $85.96.

But the options don't have that exact amount. Wait, perhaps I'm missing the insurance. The problem mentions insurance: Collision $1.20 per day and Liability $1.20 per day. So insurance per day is $2.40.

Wait, but does the problem include insurance in the cost? The question says "what is the cost of renting...", but it's not clear whether insurance is included. The options may or may not include it. Let's check.

So, if insurance is included, then for each day, we have to add $2.40.

In our case, the rental period is 2 days and 4 hours. How is the insurance charged? "per day or any part thereof". So, each day or part of a day counts as a day.

So, for 2 days and 4 hours, the days would be calculated as follows: the first 24h is day 1. The next 24h is day 2. The remaining 4h is part of day 3, so that's another day. So total of 3 days.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The insurance is charged per day or any part thereof. So, any portion of a day beyond the full days counts as an additional day.

So, for 52 hours:

The first 24h: day 1.

The next 24h: day 2.

The remaining 4h: that's part of day 3, so that's an additional day.

So, total insurance days: 3.

Each day's insurance is $1.20 collision + $1.20 liability, so $2.40 per day.

So, 3 days * $2.40 = $7.20.

So, adding that to the previous total:

Time: $35

Mileage: $50.96

Insurance: $7.20

Total: 35 +50.96 =85.96 +7.20=93.16.

Looking at the options, option J is $93.16.

But wait, the problem says "renting... for 2 days and 4 hours." So perhaps the insurance is only charged for the days the car is rented, which is 2 full days plus any part of the third day. So, 3 days' insurance.

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the insurance is only for the days the car is rented, so 2 days and 4 hours. So, 2 full days and a part of the third day, so 3 days in total for insurance.

So that brings the total to $35 + $50.96 + $7.20 = $93.16, which is option J.

But wait, the problem didn't specify whether insurance is included. The car rental schedule mentions insurance costs, but the question is about the rental cost. So perhaps the insurance is an additional cost, but the problem may not require it. Let me check the question again.

The question is: "What is the cost of renting a compact car for 2 days and 4 hours, and driving it 364 miles?" The options are given, and the insurance is listed in the schedule as an extra.

So perhaps the problem expects us to include insurance. Because the question is about the total cost, which would include any mandatory charges. Alternatively, maybe the insurance is optional, but the problem doesn't say, so perhaps we can assume that it's included.

Wait, but the problem statement doesn't specify whether to include insurance or not. Hmm, this is a bit confusing.

If I include insurance, the total is $93.16 (option J). If I don't include it, the total is $85.96, which isn't an option. So perhaps the correct approach is to include the insurance.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the time charges. Let me think again about the time charges.

Wait, perhaps the "rate per day" is applied to each 24-hour period, and any time beyond that is charged as extra hours. So for 52 hours, that's 2 days (48h) at $12 each, plus 4h at $2.75.

But wait, wait, perhaps the 2 days are 48h, so 52h is 2 days plus 4h. So, time charges: 2*$12 = $24 for the days, plus 4*$2.75 = $11. So, $35. That's correct.

Mileage: 364 * 0.14 = $50.96.

So, without insurance, it's $85.96, which isn't an option. So perhaps the insurance is included, making it $93.16, which is option J.

But another possibility is that the insurance is charged per day or any part thereof, so for 2 days and 4 hours, that's 3 days of insurance, which adds $7.20, making the total $85.96 +7.20=93.16.

So, the correct answer would be option J, $93.16.

Wait, but looking at the options, option J is $93.16. So that's the one.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the "minimum charge" is the 24-hour rate, so even if you rent for less than a day, you pay for a day. But in this case, it's 52 hours, which is more than 2 days, so that's fine.

Alternatively, perhaps the "rate per day" is a 24-hour period, so each 24h block is a day. So 52h is two full days (48h) and 4h extra. So, 2 days at $12 each, plus 4h at $2.75. That's $24 + $11 = $35. Mileage is $50.96.

So $85.96, but no option matches. So the only way to reach an option is to include the insurance, making the total $93.16, option J.

To determine the cost of renting a compact car for 2 days and 4 hours, and driving 364 miles, we analyze the given rates and charges:

### Time Charges
- **Rate per Day**: $12.00 for each 24-hour period.
- **Extra Hours**: $2.75 per hour for any time beyond 24 hours.

The total rental duration is **52 hours**:
1. **First 24 hours**: Charged at the daily rate of $12.00.
2. **Next 24 hours**: Charged at the daily rate of $12.00.
3. **Remaining 4 hours**: Charged at the extra hourly rate of $2.75 per hour.

Thus, the time charges are:
\[
\text{Time Charges} = (2 \times 12.00) + (4 \times 2.75) = 24.00 + 11.00 = 35.00 \, \text{dollars}.
\]

### Mileage Charges
- **Rate per Mile**: $0.14 per mile.

For **364 miles**, the mileage charge is:
\[
\text{Mileage Charges} = 364 \times 0.14 = 50.96 \, \text{dollars}.
\]

### Insurance Charges
- **Collision Insurance**: $1.20 per day or any part thereof.
- **Liability Insurance**: $1.20 per day or any part thereof.

The rental duration is **2 days and 4 hours**, which is treated as **3 days** for insurance purposes (since any part of a day counts as a full day). The total insurance charge is:
\[
\text{Insurance Charges} = 3 \times (1.20 + 1.20) = 3 \times 2.40 = 7.20 \, \text{dollars}.
\]

### Total Cost
Adding up all the charges:
\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Time Charges} + \text{Mileage Charges} + \text{Insurance Charges} = 35.00 + 50.96 + 7.20 = 93.16 \, \text{dollars}.
\]

### Final Answer
The total cost of renting the compact car is **$93.16**, which corresponds to **option J**.
