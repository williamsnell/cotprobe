Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm a bit new to this kind of stuff, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem says: A person weighs 62 kg. Their drug dose is 15 mg/kg. How many grams is their dose? And then there are multiple-choice options from A to J.

Hmm, right, so I need to find the dose in grams. I remember that mg stands for milligrams and kg is kilograms. Oh wait, and grams are bigger than milligrams. So I think I'll have to convert the dose from milligrams to grams somehow.

Let me break it down. The dose is 15 mg per kg of body weight. The person's weight is 62 kg. So first, I should calculate the total dose in milligrams and then convert that to grams.

So, the calculation would be 15 mg/kg multiplied by 62 kg. Let me do that math. 15 times 62... 15 times 60 is 900, and 15 times 2 is 30, so total is 930 mg. Oh wait, mg is milligrams, but the question asks for grams.

Right, I need to convert milligrams to grams. I remember that 1 gram is equal to 1000 milligrams. So to get grams, I divide the milligrams by 1000.

So 930 mg divided by 1000 is 0.93 grams. Let me check that again. 930 divided by 1000 is 0.930, which is 0.93 when rounded to two decimal places.

Now, looking at the options provided:

A: 0.186
B: 0.93
C: 18.6 x 10^-3
D: 0.0186
E: 186
F: 9.3
G: 18.6
H: 1.86
I: 93
J: 930

Option B is 0.93, which matches my calculation. Just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me think again. 15 mg/kg times 62 kg is 930 mg. 930 mg is 0.93 grams because 1 mg is 0.001 grams. So yes, that's correct.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. So the correct answer should be B: 0.93.
</think>

The dose is calculated by multiplying the drug dose per kilogram (15 mg/kg) by the person's weight (62 kg), resulting in 930 mg. Converting milligrams to grams by dividing by 1000 gives 0.93 grams. 

The correct answer is **B: 0.93**.
