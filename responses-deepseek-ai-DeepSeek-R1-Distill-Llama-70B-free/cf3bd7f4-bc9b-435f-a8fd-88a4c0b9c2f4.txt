Question:

A football player sued a football team for breach of contract. He was a star player for the team before suffering a serious hip injury. Although the player attempted to continue playing for the team, he failed a physical examination and was cut from the team roster. After failing his physical, the team discontinued making contract payments to the player as per the terms of his employment contract. In his lawsuit, the player claimed that he was physically fit to continue playing but that he was cut from the team because they wanted to stop making contract payments. At trial, the team called its physician, an orthopedist, to testify that the player's hip injury was, in fact, career-threatening and, in his opinion, sufficiently serious to warrant failing his physical. The team physician stated during his testimony that his diagnosis was based, in part, upon an examination of the player's x-rays and review of an MRI test conducted by another doctor. Neither the x-rays nor the MRI test results have been admitted into evidence. In all likelihood, the team physician's testimony should be

Options:

A: inadmissible, because the team physician is not a radiologist capable of interpreting MRI results.
B: admissible, if the football player confirms that the physician's diagnosis was shared with him.
C: admissible, provided that the other doctor testifies as to the validity of the MRI test results.
D: admissible, provided that the team physician has been practicing for more than 10 years.
E: inadmissible, because the team physician's opinion was not based in part upon his own firsthand observation of the player's physical condition.
F: inadmissible, because neither the x-rays nor the MRI test results had been admitted into evidence at the time he formulated his opinion.
G: admissible, only if the x-rays and MRI test results are presented during the trial.
H: admissible, provided the team physician based his opinion on data reasonably relied upon by other orthopedic physicians in the field.
I: inadmissible, as the team physician has a possible bias towards the football team.
J: inadmissible, because the team physician should have conducted the MRI test himself.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically dealing with expert testimony and the admissibility of certain evidence. Let me try to unpack this step by step.

The scenario is about a football player suing his team for breach of contract. The player was cut from the team after failing a physical, and the team stopped paying him. The player claims he was fit, but the team says his hip injury was career-threatening. At trial, the team's physician, an orthopedist, testifies that the injury was serious enough to fail the physical. His diagnosis was based on x-rays and an MRI done by another doctor. Neither the x-rays nor the MRI has been admitted into evidence yet.

The question is whether the physician's testimony is admissible. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that expert testimony is allowed under certain conditions. Experts can testify based on facts or data in the case, which may be made known during the trial. But there's a rule about the foundation for such testimony. I think it's Federal Rule of Evidence 703, which says that an expert may base an opinion on facts or data in the case that the expert has been made aware of or personally observed. Importantly, the underlying data doesn't have to be admissible itself if it's the type of data that's reasonably relied upon by experts in the field.

So in this case, the orthopedist is using x-rays and MRI results from another doctor. Those specific documents haven't been admitted into evidence. But the question is whether the physician can still testify based on them.

I recall that under FRE 703, the expert doesn't need the underlying data to be admitted as long as it's the kind of information that others in the field would rely on. So even if the x-rays and MRI aren't in evidence, the expert can still use them as the basis for his opinion if that's a standard practice.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's inadmissible because the physician isn't a radiologist. But the issue isn't about his specialty; it's about the basis of his testimony. Orthopedists can interpret x-rays and MRIs as part of their practice, so A is probably not correct.

Option B talks about the player confirming the diagnosis was shared. I don't think that affects admissibility; the player's confirmation isn't required for the expert's testimony to be based on those tests.

Option C says the other doctor must testify about the MRI. That might be necessary for the MRI to be admitted as evidence, but the expert can still rely on it for his opinion without the other doctor testifying, as long as it's reliable.

Option D mentions practicing for over 10 years. I don't think the length of practice affects admissibility here. It might go to the weight of his testimony, but not its admissibility.

Option E says the testimony is inadmissible because the opinion wasn't based on firsthand observation. But the physician did examine the player, so that's not the case. Plus, experts can rely on data they haven't personally observed.

Option F argues that since the x-rays and MRI weren't admitted before he formed his opinion, his testimony is inadmissible. But under FRE 703, the data doesn't have to be admitted into evidence for the expert to rely on it. So F is incorrect.

Option G says the testimony is admissible only if the x-rays and MRI are presented during trial. But the expert can testify without the underlying data being admitted, as long as the data is of a type reasonably relied upon. So G is not correct.

Option H states that the testimony is admissible if the physician based his opinion on data that other orthopedic physicians reasonably rely on. That aligns with what I was thinking earlier. Since orthopedists typically rely on x-rays and MRI results, this option seems correct.

Option I suggests bias makes the testimony inadmissible. Bias goes to the credibility, not admissibility, so I is incorrect.

Option J says the physician should have done the MRI himself. That's not necessary; experts can rely on tests done by others.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be H.

The admissibility of the team physician's testimony hinges on whether it meets the standards for expert testimony under Federal Rule of Evidence 703. This rule allows experts to base their opinions on facts or data that are not necessarily admitted into evidence, provided such data is of the type reasonably relied upon by experts in the field. In this case, the orthopedist based his opinion on x-rays and MRI results, which are standard diagnostic tools in his field. The fact that these specific documents have not been admitted into evidence does not render his testimony inadmissible, as long as the data he relied on is the type that orthopedists would reasonably depend on.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. The physician's specialty as an orthopedist, not a radiologist, does not bar him from interpreting x-rays and MRI results.
- **B**: Incorrect. The player's confirmation of the diagnosis is irrelevant to the admissibility of the testimony.
- **C**: Incorrect. The other doctor's testimony about the MRI is unnecessary for the admissibility of the physician's opinion.
- **D**: Incorrect. The length of the physician's practice does not affect admissibility.
- **E**: Incorrect. The physician's opinion was based on his examination of the player and reliance on standard diagnostic tools.
- **F**: Incorrect. Under FRE 703, the underlying data does not need to be admitted into evidence for the expert's opinion to be admissible.
- **G**: Incorrect. The testimony does not require the x-rays and MRI to be presented during the trial for it to be admissible.
- **H**: Correct. The testimony is admissible if the physician based his opinion on data reasonably relied upon by orthopedists.
- **I**: Incorrect. Bias affects credibility, not admissibility.
- **J**: Incorrect. The physician does not need to have conducted the MRI himself to rely on its results.

Thus, the correct answer is **H**, as it aligns with the standards for expert testimony under FRE 703. 

Answer: H
