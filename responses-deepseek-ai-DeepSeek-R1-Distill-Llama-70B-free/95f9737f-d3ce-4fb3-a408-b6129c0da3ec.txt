Okay, so I've got this question here about ethical guidelines in psychology, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it carefully.

The question is about Alice A., who has a master's degree in clinical psychology but isn't licensed. She's been hired by a community mental health clinic to administer several standard psychological tests to adult clients. The question is whether this is acceptable according to ethical guidelines.

The options are A through J, each giving a different scenario about whether it's acceptable or not, and under what conditions.

Hmm, I remember from my studies that licensing is a big deal in psychology. Licensed psychologists have gone through certain requirements, like a doctorate, supervised experience, and passing exams. But what about someone with just a master's degree?

I think that in many places, you don't need a doctoral degree to administer tests, but you do need proper training and supervision. Like, maybe a master's level person can do testing under the supervision of a licensed psychologist.

Wait, the question says she's administering standard psychological tests. So she's not diagnosing or treating, just giving the tests. Does that require a license? Or is that something that can be done under supervision?

I recall that the APA ethical guidelines talk about scope of practice and supervision. If someone isn't licensed, they can still perform certain tasks as long as they're supervised by someone who is licensed and qualified.

Looking at the options:

Option D says it's unacceptable because she's not licensed. But I'm not sure. If she's supervised, maybe it's okay.

Option E says it's acceptable if a clinical psychologist supervises her. That sounds plausible.

Option A says a co-sign is enough. I'm not sure if co-signing is sufficient, or if supervision is needed.

Option B says it's unacceptable because she doesn't have a doctoral degree. But I don't think a doctoral degree is always required for administering tests. A master's might be sufficient with the right training.

Option C mentions a professional counselor supervising. But does a counselor have the authority to supervise psychological testing? I think it's more about the supervisor being a licensed psychologist.

Option F is similar to B, focusing on PhD, which I don't think is the main issue here.

Option G talks about pursuing licensure. I'm not sure if that affects the current situation.

Option H is about specialization in testing. Maybe not necessary if she's properly trained.

Option I is about liability insurance. That's a legal aspect, but the question is about ethical guidelines, so maybe not the main point.

Option J is about additional training and certification. She already has a master's, so maybe she's qualified, but perhaps she needs supervision.

So putting it together: The key points are her not being licensed, but having a master's. The ethical guidelines probably allow her to administer tests under supervision of a licensed psychologist. So the correct answer would be E.

The question revolves around whether Alice A., who has a master's degree in clinical psychology but is not licensed, can ethically administer psychological tests under the ethical guidelines. The key consideration is that while licensure is important, it is not necessarily required for administering tests if proper supervision is in place. Ethical guidelines typically allow individuals with appropriate training, such as a master's degree, to perform tasks like administering standard psychological tests under the supervision of a licensed psychologist. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option D** is incorrect because lack of licensure does not automatically make it unacceptable if she is supervised.
- **Option E** is correct because it aligns with ethical guidelines that permit such activities under the supervision of a licensed clinical psychologist.
- Other options either focus on irrelevant factors (e.g., doctoral degree, liability insurance) or do not address the necessity of supervision by a licensed psychologist.

Thus, the correct answer is **E: acceptable as long as a professional clinical psychologist supervises Alice’s activities.**
