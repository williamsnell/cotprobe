Okay, so I've got this question about statistics here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's asking. The question is about a skewed smooth distribution with a tail extended to the left. I need to find out which statistic has the highest value among the options given.

Hmm, first, I should probably remember what a skewed distribution looks like. Skewness refers to the asymmetry of the probability distribution. If the tail is extended to the left, that means it's negatively skewed, right? Wait, no, wait. I think I might have that backwards. Let me think. If the tail is on the left, that means the higher values are on the right, so the distribution is negatively skewed. Or is it positive? Oh wait, I think when the tail is to the left, the skew is positive because the tail is on the lower end. Wait, no. I'm getting confused.

Wait, no, skewness is determined by the direction of the tail. So if the distribution has a longer tail on the left side, that's negative skew because the bulk of the data is on the right. Alternatively, I think negative skew means the tail is on the left. Wait, no, maybe the opposite. Let me clarify: Positive skew means the tail is on the right (so the data is spread out towards higher values), making the mean higher than the median. Negative skew is when the tail is on the left, so the mean is lower than the median.

Wait, maybe I should think about the measures of central tendency. In a negatively skewed distribution (tail left), the mean is less than the median, which is less than the mode. Because the tail pulls the mean down. So the order would be mode > median > mean. So the mode is the highest, median next, and mean the lowest among these three.

But the question is about which statistic has the highest value. So the options include mean, median, mode, and others like variance, standard deviation, etc.

Wait, but the question is about the statistic with the highest value. So, let's look at the options. The options are A: median, H: mean, I: mode, and others like variance, standard deviation, etc.

In a left-tailed (negatively skewed) distribution, the mode is the highest point. So the mode would be higher than the median, which in turn is higher than the mean. So among the options, the mode (I) would be the highest. But wait, the question is about which statistic is the highest. So the mode is the highest value among measures of central tendency.

But what about the other options? Like variance (E), standard deviation (G), range (F), etc. These are measures of spread, not central tendency. So their values are not directly comparable to means or medians.

Wait, the question says "the statistic with the highest value." So, we need to compare all the options. For example, standard deviation is a measure of spread, which can be higher than any central tendency measure depending on the data.

Wait, but in a distribution, which statistic is typically the highest? For instance, the range is the difference between max and min. If the data has a high range, that could be very large. But the question is about a skewed distribution, so the range could be large, but how does that compare to other statistics?

Wait, but the question is phrased as "the statistic with the highest value is the..." So, for example, the mean could be 5, the median 6, the mode 7, the range could be 10, the variance 4, standard deviation 2, etc. So the range might be the highest, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the standard deviation and variance are calculated based on the mean. So if the mean is lower than the median and mode, the standard deviation could be a significant value, but perhaps not necessarily higher than the range.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think again. The question is about a left-skewed distribution. So, in such a distribution, the mean is less than the median, which is less than the mode. So the mode is the highest among these three.

But the question is which statistic is the highest. So, for example, the mean is one value, the median another, the mode another, the range is another, etc. So which of these is the highest.

Wait, but the range is the maximum value minus the minimum value. If the distribution has a long tail to the left, the minimum could be very low, making the range large. So the range could be a high value, perhaps higher than the mode.

But the question is phrased as "the statistic with the highest value is the". So, in a left-tailed distribution, which of the given statistics would have the highest value.

Wait, perhaps the mean is lower, but what about the variance and standard deviation? They measure spread, so in a distribution with a long tail, the variance and standard deviation could be higher than in a symmetric distribution.

But let's consider the options:

Option F is the range. Option E is variance, G is standard deviation. Option I is mode.

So which is the highest? The range is a raw difference, while variance is squared units, but standard deviation is in the same units as the data.

Wait, but in terms of magnitude, the range could be larger than the standard deviation. For example, suppose data ranges from 0 to 10, the range is 10. The standard deviation could be, say, 2. So the range is higher.

But the question is in a left-tailed distribution, so the range would be determined by the lowest value and the highest. The highest might not be extremely high because the tail is on the left. Wait, no, the tail is on the left, meaning the lower end is extended. So the minimum could be very low, but the maximum might be not as high as the maximum in a right-tailed distribution.

Wait, but in a left-tailed distribution, the maximum would be on the right. So, the maximum could be higher than the mean, but the minimum could be much lower than the mean. So the range (max - min) could be quite large, perhaps larger than the mode, which is just a data point.

But without specific numbers, it's hard to say, but the question is about which statistic is the highest. So, in a left-tailed distribution, the mode is the highest among the central tendency measures, but the range could be larger than any central tendency measure.

Wait, but the question is in a smooth distribution. Smooth, so it's continuous. So the mode might not be the highest point if it's a peak, but the maximum value in the data could be higher than the mode's value.

Alternatively, in a smooth distribution, perhaps the maximum is the highest point, but the mode is the peak of the distribution.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about the options given. The options include the mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, range, etc.

In a left-skewed distribution, the mean is lower than the median, which is lower than the mode. So among mean, median, and mode, the mode is the highest.

But the question is about all the options. So, for example, the range could be higher than the mode. Because the range is the difference between max and min, which could be very large, especially with a long tail. So, if the data goes down to a very low minimum, the range could be larger than the mode's value.

Wait, but the mode is a specific value in the data, whereas the range is the difference. So, for example, if the mode is 50, and the range is 100, then the range is higher. But the question is asking which statistic has the highest value. So if the range is 100, that's higher than the mode's value of 50.

So the highest statistic would be the range.

Alternatively, the variance is the squared deviation, so it's always positive, but it's in squared units, so it's not directly comparable to the data's units.

Wait, but the question doesn't specify units, so perhaps the range is the highest. But I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, let me think again. The question is about which statistic has the highest value. Let's consider each option:

A: median - a value in the middle of the data.

B: interquartile range - difference between Q3 and Q1.

C: geometric mean - another average, but usually less than arithmetic mean.

D: quartile deviation - same as interquartile range, I think.

E: variance - squared units.

F: range - max - min.

G: standard deviation - square root of variance, in data units.

H: mean - the average.

I: mode - the most frequent value.

J: harmonic mean - another type of average, lower than geometric.

In a left-skewed distribution, the mean is less than the median, which is less than the mode. So the mode is higher than the median and mean.

But the range is the difference between the highest and lowest values. If the distribution has a long left tail, the minimum could be very low, making the range large.

So, for example, suppose the data ranges from -100 to 50. The range is 150. The mode might be 40, the median 30, mean 20. So in this case, the range (150) is the highest statistic.

So in this scenario, the range (option F) is the highest.

Wait, but in the options, option F is the range. So the answer would be F.

But wait, I'm getting a bit tangled. Let me try to structure it.

In a negatively skewed (left-tailed) distribution:

- Mode > Median > Mean.

So among the measures of central tendency, the mode is the highest.

However, the question is about all statistics, including measures of spread.

The range is a measure of spread, calculated as max - min.

In a left-tailed distribution, the min could be much lower than the mean, making the range potentially much larger than the mode's value.

For example:

Data: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, -100.

Here, the mode might be 50 (just as an example), but the range is 100 - (-100) = 200, which is much higher than the mode's value of 50.

So in this case, the range is the highest statistic.

Thus, the answer would be F: range.

Wait, but the question says "the statistic with the highest value". So if the range is 200, and the mode is 50, then the range is the highest.

Therefore, the correct answer is F: range.

In a negatively skewed (left-tailed) distribution, the tail extends to the left, meaning the data is spread out toward the lower end. This affects the relative values of various statistics:

1. **Central Tendency Measures**:  
   - The mode is the highest among the measures of central tendency because it represents the most frequent value, and in a left-tailed distribution, it is greater than the median, which in turn is greater than the mean.  
   - The order is: **mode > median > mean**.

2. **Measures of Spread**:  
   - The range, calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum values, can be very large in a left-tailed distribution because the minimum value can be significantly lower due to the extended tail.  
   - Other measures of spread, such as variance and standard deviation, are in different units (squared units for variance and the same units as the data for standard deviation) and are not directly comparable to the range.

3. **Comparison of Statistics**:  
   - While the mode is the highest among the measures of central tendency, the range is a measure of spread and can have a much larger value than the mode, especially in a left-tailed distribution with a long tail.  
   - For example, if the data ranges from -100 to 50, the range is 150, which is likely much larger than the mode's value.

Given the question asks for the statistic with the highest value, the range (option F) is the correct answer because it can be significantly larger than the mode or any other statistic in a left-tailed distribution.

**Answer: F**
