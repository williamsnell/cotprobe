Question:

A truck driver was assigned to drive a huge tractor- trailer loaded with logs. The logs were being sold by a lumber company, which had loaded the tractor- trailer. After four hours of steady driving, the truck driver stopped at a lounge and consumed five bottles of beer. He left the tavern in an intoxicated condition and then drove off to make his final delivery. As he came to the top of a steep incline in the highway and started his descent, an 11-year-old girl suddenly darted out into the road directly in front of him. The truck driver slammed on his powerful air brakes and swerved sharply to the left to avoid hitting her, but the girl was struck by the tractor- trailer and was seriously injured. The girl's parents, on behalf of their daughter, assert a claim against the lumber company to recover damages for the girl's injuries. At trial, which of the following is LEAST likely to be admissible?

Options:

A: Evidence that the truck driver completed a state-approved alcohol education program, if the driver claims that he was not intoxicated.
B: Evidence that the truck driver's reputation for driving is poor, if the lumber company and truck driver argue that the latter was not negligent.
C: Evidence that the lumber company carried liability insurance on the tractor-trailer, if an investigator for the lumber company's insurance company testified for the lumber company that they deny ownership of the truck.
D: Evidence that the girl had darted into the road in front of vehicles before, if the parents argue that she was frightened by the truck.
E: Evidence that the truck driver had a previous conviction for a DUI five years ago.
F: Evidence of the girl's school records, if her parents argue that she was a cautious child.
G: Evidence that the lumber company carried liability insurance on the tractor-trailer, if the lumber company argues that the truck driver was an independent contractor.
H: Evidence that the truck driver was on his phone at the time of the accident, if the lumber company argues that the driver was distracted.
I: Evidence that the truck driver pleaded guilty to a criminal charge of DUI arising from this incident.
J: Evidence that the lumber company had previously been fined for overloading their trucks, if the lumber company argues that the truck was not overloaded.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about evidence admissibility in a trial. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on evidence law, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is about a truck driver who was delivering logs for a lumber company. He stopped at a lounge, drank five beers, then drove again. An 11-year-old girl darted in front of him, he tried to avoid her but she was hit. Now, the girl's parents are suing the lumber company. At trial, which of the options is least likely to be admissible?

The options are from A to J. I need to figure out which one is least likely to be admitted as evidence.

First, I should recall the basic rules of evidence. Things like relevance, hearsay, character evidence, and the exceptions. Also, things like prior convictions, evidence of insurance, and so on.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Evidence that the truck driver completed a state-approved alcohol education program, if the driver claims he wasn't intoxicated. I think this might be admissible. It's a fact that could show he took steps to address drinking, which might support his claim of not being intoxicated. But wait, does it? Or is it more about his current state? Maybe it's relevant to his credibility on whether he was intoxicated at the time of the accident.

Option B: Evidence that the truck driver's reputation for driving is poor, if the company and driver argue he wasn't negligent. Reputation evidence is generally admissible for character traits, but I think it's limited. Like, you can use specific instances of conduct if they're relevant, but reputation might be allowed under certain circumstances. Wait, but for a civil case, when a party's character is at issue, maybe it's allowed. Or perhaps here, since they're arguing he wasn't negligent, evidence of his poor reputation as a driver could be relevant to show he's prone to negligence. I'm not sure, but I'll keep this in mind.

Option C: Evidence that the lumber company had liability insurance on the tractor-trailer, if an investigator for their insurance company testified that they deny ownership. Hmm, usually evidence of liability insurance is inadmissible because it might prejudice the jury into thinking the defendant has deep pockets. But there's an exception when the existence of insurance is a genuine issue in the case. Here, the company's investigator is denying ownership, so perhaps the insurance evidence is relevant to show that the company does own the truck (since they have insurance on it), which would make them liable. So maybe this is admissible under the exception.

Option D: Evidence that the girl had darted into the road before, if the parents argue she was frightened by the truck. So, the parents are saying the girl was scared, implying perhaps she acted reasonably. But the defense might want to show that she had a habit of darting into the road, indicating she was prone to such behavior regardless. This would be relevant to her credibility or to show that her actions were a habit, making the accident more her fault. So this evidence would probably be admissible.

Option E: Evidence that the truck driver had a previous DUI conviction five years ago. Prior convictions are generally admissible to attack the credibility of a witness, but wait, the driver is a party here. But also, in a civil case, if the driver's history is relevant to show a pattern of behavior, like being prone to driving under the influence, it might be admissible. But there's a rule against admitting old convictions if they're too remote. Five years isn't that old, but I think for impeachment purposes, it's allowed if it's a crime of dishonesty or a felony. DUI is a crime, so maybe it's admissible to show he has a history, making it more likely he was intoxicated this time.

Option F: Evidence of the girl's school records, if her parents argue she was cautious. School records are generally confidential, but under the Federal Rules, they might be admissible if relevant. If the parents claim she's cautious, the defense might want to introduce evidence that she's not, like if she's been known to be impulsive. But school records could be protected under FERPA, but in a civil trial, maybe they can be obtained with a subpoena. Alternatively, maybe specific instances of her behavior from the records could be used, but perhaps not the entire records. Not sure if this is admissible, but I'll think more on this.

Option G: Evidence that the lumber company had liability insurance on the tractor-trailer, if the company argues the driver was an independent contractor. Again, usually insurance is inadmissible, but if the company is claiming the driver was an independent contractor (thus, not their employee, so not vicariously liable), then the fact that they have insurance on the tractor-trailer might indicate that they have control over it, implying an employer-employee relationship. So perhaps this is admissible to rebut the independent contractor argument.

Option H: Evidence that the truck driver was on his phone at the time of the accident, if the company argues he was distracted. This seems relevant. If the company is saying he was distracted, evidence that he was on his phone would support that, making it admissible. But wait, the company is arguing he was distracted, so the plaintiffs might introduce this evidence to show he was negligent. So yes, this would be admissible.

Option I: Evidence that the truck driver pleaded guilty to a DUI arising from this incident. A guilty plea is an admission, which is admissible. It's a statement by a party opponent, so it's an exception to hearsay. So this would be admissible against the driver and possibly against the company if they're vicariously liable.

Option J: Evidence that the lumber company had been previously fined for overloading trucks, if they argue the truck wasn't overloaded. This seems like it's about the company's history. Prior fines could be admissible as evidence of a pattern or practice, showing that the company has a tendency to overload, making it more likely they did it this time. So this would be relevant and admissible.

Now, the question is which is least likely to be admissible. Let's go back through each.

Option B: Reputation evidence about the driver's poor driving reputation. Generally, reputation evidence is admissible for certain purposes. In a civil case, when a person's character is at issue, reputation evidence is allowed. Here, if the defense is that the driver wasn't negligent, the plaintiff might try to show that the driver has a poor reputation as a driver, which would make his negligence more probable. So I think this is admissible.

Option F: School records about the girl being cautious. If the parents argue she's cautious, the defense might want to show she's not. But school records are typically confidential and protected. However, in litigation, they can sometimes be subpoenaed. But even if they are, the question is whether the specific records are relevant. If the records contain information about her behavior, like being impulsive, then parts of them might be admissible. But I'm not sure if the entire school records would be admissible. Maybe only specific instances. So this might be inadmissible if the records are being offered as a whole without relevance.

Wait, but the option says "evidence of the girl's school records". So perhaps the defense is trying to introduce her school records to show she wasn't cautious. If the records are not relevant, or if they're protected, then they might not be admissible. Alternatively, maybe under the Federal Rules, they could be admissible if they're relevant and not otherwise protected. But I'm a bit fuzzy on this.

Alternatively, let's think about the other options. Option C is about insurance evidence, which is usually inadmissible except when it's relevant to ownership. Here, the company is denying ownership, so the insurance evidence would be relevant to show they do own it, making it admissible under the exception.

Option F, if the girl's school records are being offered to show she's cautious, but maybe the records don't have any information about that. Or maybe they're too broad. It's possible that school records would be considered irrelevant or inadmissible because they don't directly relate to her tendency to be cautious or not. Or maybe the school records are protected under privacy laws, making them inadmissible unless there's a specific waiver.

Wait, but in a trial, parties can subpoena records if they're relevant. So perhaps the school records could be subpoenaed, but the court might require that only relevant parts are admitted. So if, for example, the school records have grades and attendance but nothing about behavior, then they're not relevant. But if the records include, say, incident reports where she was caught darting into the road before, then that would be relevant.

But the option says "if her parents argue that she was a cautious child." So maybe the school records are being offered to contradict that. But if the records don't have any information about her behavior regarding caution, then they're not relevant. So introducing the entire school records would be too broad and not relevant, making them inadmissible. Alternatively, if the records are being used to show specific instances of her behavior, but as reputation evidence, that's different.

Alternatively, maybe it's more about the privacy of the records. I'm not sure, but I think that school records are generally protected, and without a specific showing of relevance, they might not be admissible. So perhaps option F is the least likely to be admissible.

Wait, but another angle: in a civil case, the plaintiff's character is not at issue unless they put it in issue. Here, the parents are arguing that the girl was cautious, so the defense might be allowed to rebut that by showing she's not. But how? They could use specific instances of her behavior, but not necessarily her entire school records. So perhaps the school records are not the right way to do this, making option F inadmissible.

Alternatively, maybe the school records are admissible if they contain relevant information, but if they don't, then they're not. But the option doesn't specify what's in the records, just that they're being offered as evidence. So, in that case, it's possible that the court would exclude them as irrelevant or too broad.

So, considering all the options, the one that stands out as least likely to be admissible is Option B? No, wait, Option B is about the driver's reputation. I think that's admissible because it's about his driving habits. The least likely is probably Option F, because school records are protected and may not be relevant unless specific parts are used.

Wait, another thought: Option C. The lumber company's insurance. Normally, evidence of insurance is inadmissible under FRE 411, but there's an exception when the insurance's existence is a fact at issue. Here, the company is denying ownership, so the fact that they have insurance on the tractor-trailer could show they own it. Thus, it's admissible under the exception. So Option C is admissible.

So, going back, the least likely is probably Option F, because school records are protected, and without specific relevance, they're not admissible. Alternatively, Option B is about the driver's reputation, which is admissible.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think about each option again quickly.

The question is which is LEAST likely to be admissible.

Option A: The driver completed an alcohol program. If he claims he wasn't intoxicated, this might be relevant to show he's addressed his drinking, but I'm not sure if it's admissible. It could be considered character evidence, which is generally not admissible except in specific cases. But this is more about his qualifications or efforts, but not directly about his state at the time. Maybe it's not relevant, making it inadmissible. Hmm, but he's claiming he wasn't intoxicated, so perhaps this evidence is offered to support his claim, implying he's responsible and addressed his drinking, so it's relevant. Not sure, but I'm leaning towards it being admissible.

Option B: The driver's reputation is poor. This is about his character as a driver, which is relevant to whether he was negligent. So it's admissible.

Option F: School records to show she's cautious. If the records don't contain info about her being cautious, then they're irrelevant. Or perhaps they're protected, making them inadmissible. So this might be the least likely.

Option G: Insurance on the truck when the company argues he's an independent contractor. The insurance shows ownership, so it's relevant, making it admissible.

Option I: DUI guilty plea. Admissible as an admission.

So, putting it all together, the least likely is Option F.
</think>

To determine which evidence is least likely to be admissible, we analyze each option under the rules of evidence, focusing on relevance, hearsay, character evidence, and specific exceptions.

### Option A:
Evidence that the truck driver completed a state-approved alcohol education program is relevant if the driver claims he was not intoxicated. It could support his claim by showing he addressed his drinking habits. This is likely admissible.

### Option B:
Evidence of the truck driver's poor reputation as a driver is admissible if the defense argues he was not negligent. Reputation evidence is allowed to challenge or support a party's character when relevant to the case. This is likely admissible.

### Option C:
Evidence that the lumber company carried liability insurance on the tractor-trailer is generally inadmissible under FRE 411, but there is an exception when the existence of insurance is a genuine issue in the case. Here, the company denies ownership, so the insurance evidence is relevant to establish ownership. This is likely admissible.

### Option D:
Evidence that the girl had darted into the road before is relevant to rebut the argument that she was cautious. It shows a pattern of behavior, making it admissible.

### Option E:
A previous DUI conviction is admissible to show a pattern of behavior and to attack the driver's credibility. This is likely admissible.

### Option F:
Evidence of the girl's school records is problematic. School records are typically protected under privacy laws, and their admissibility depends on relevance. If the records do not contain specific information about her behavior or caution, they are irrelevant. Without a clear connection to the issue of her cautiousness, they are unlikely to be admissible.

### Option G:
Evidence of the lumber company's liability insurance on the tractor-trailer is admissible if it rebuts the argument that the driver was an independent contractor. This evidence is relevant to show the company's control over the truck. This is likely admissible.

### Option H:
Evidence that the truck driver was on his phone at the time of the accident is relevant to show distraction and negligence. This is likely admissible.

### Option I:
A guilty plea to a DUI charge arising from the incident is an admission by a party opponent and is admissible under the rules of evidence. This is likely admissible.

### Option J:
Evidence of the lumber company's prior fines for overloading trucks is relevant to show a pattern or practice, making it admissible if the company argues the truck was not overloaded. This is likely admissible.

### Conclusion:
Option F is the least likely to be admissible because school records are protected, and without specific relevance to the girl's cautiousness, they are unlikely to be admitted.
