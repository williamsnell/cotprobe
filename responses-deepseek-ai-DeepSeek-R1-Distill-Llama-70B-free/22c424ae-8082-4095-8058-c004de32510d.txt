Question:

A manager's competitor sent a defamatory letter to the manager accusing him of professional incompetence and calling him one of the worst businessmen in town. It was addressed to the manager. He read it, put it in a private drawer, and did not read it again. Later, he tried to sue the competitor for defamation as a result of the letter. Will the court likely grant the defendant's motion to dismiss, and on what grounds? Base your answer on the common law definition of defamation.

B: Yes, it will dismiss on the grounds that the manager did not suffer any actual harm or damage as a result of the letter.
C: No, it will not dismiss because the manager has the right to sue for emotional damages.
D: No, it will not dismiss because the letter constitutes malicious intent.
E: Yes, it will dismiss on the basis that the language is not damaging to the manager's reputation.
F: Yes, it will dismiss because the competitor has freedom of speech.
G: No, it will not dismiss because the competitor intentionally sent the letter to harm the manager's reputation.
H: Yes, it will dismiss on the basis that the publication is made to the manager alone.
I: No, it will not dismiss because the circumstances show that all of the elements of defamation are all present.
J: Yes, it will dismiss on the grounds that the letter does not specifically mention the manager's profession.

Okay, so I've got this question about defamation, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

The scenario is that a manager's competitor sent a defamatory letter. The letter accuses the manager of professional incompetence and calls him one of the worst businessmen in town. The manager read it, put it in a private drawer, and didn't show it to anyone else. Now, he's trying to sue for defamation, and the question is whether the court will grant the defendant's motion to dismiss, and on what grounds.

I remember that defamation has certain elements. From what I've studied, under common law, defamation requires that the statement be defamatory, published to a third party, cause harm, and meet other criteria depending on the situation, like whether it's slander or libel.

Wait, but waitâ€”the letter was addressed to the manager and only read by him. So, the publication aspect is key here. Because in defamation, especially slander, the statement needs to be communicated to a third party. If the defamatory statement was only seen by the plaintiff, then there's no publication. Because publication is an essential element.

So in this case, the manager read the letter, but no one else did. He didn't show it to anyone. So the competitor didn't publish it to anyone else; it was only sent directly to the manager, who kept it to himself. 

Under common law, for slander (which is spoken defamation), the statement usually requires publication to a third party, and without that, the plaintiff typically can't bring a case unless it falls under one of the exceptions, like if the statement relates to the plaintiff's profession. But wait, there's an exception when the statement is about business or profession, and if it's known to be false, it can be actionable without proof of special damages. But that's more about whether damages are presumed, not the publication part.

Wait, no, the key here is publication. The statement has to be communicated to someone else besides the plaintiff for it to be actionable as defamation. Because if only the plaintiff reads it, then there's no harm to reputation since no third party knows. So the manager can't claim defamation because the letter wasn't published to others.

Looking at the options, option H says the court will dismiss because the publication was made to the manager alone. That seems to fit because without publication to a third party, the defamation claim fails.

Wait, but what about libel? Because a letter is written, so that's libel. Libel is generally more permanent than slander. But the same rule applies that the statement must be published to a third party. So even if it's libel, if only the plaintiff saw it, there's no publication, so the case can be dismissed.

So the ground for dismissal would be that there's no publication. Which matches option H.

So the answer should be H.

The court will likely grant the defendant's motion to dismiss because the defamatory letter was only addressed to and read by the manager, with no third-party publication. Publication to a third party is a required element of defamation under common law, and its absence here undermines the claim.
