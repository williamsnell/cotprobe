Question:

There are 20 students in Mr. Clark's fourth-grade class. There are 5 times as many students in the entire fourth grade as there are in Mr. Clark's class. Which equation can be used to determine the number of students, n, in the entire fourth grade?

Options:

A: 20x5=n
B: n=5/20
C: 5xn= 20
D: 20+5=n
E: n=20-5
F: 5+20=n
G: 20/n=5
H: 5n=20

Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me read it again.

Mr. Clark's fourth-grade class has 20 students. The entire fourth grade has 5 times as many students as his class. I need to find an equation to determine the total number of students, n, in the entire fourth grade.

Hmm, so Mr. Clark's class is just one part of the fourth grade. The whole grade has more students. The problem says the entire grade is 5 times Mr. Clark's class. So if his class has 20, then the whole grade has 5 times that.

Wait, so it's like n equals 5 multiplied by the number in his class. His class is 20, so n should be 5 times 20. That makes sense because 5 times more would mean adding four more sets of 20, right? So 20 plus 20 four times, but that's the same as 20 multiplied by 5.

Let me look at the options. Option A is 20x5=n. Oh wait, that's exactly what I was thinking. Because 20 times 5 gives the total number. So that should be the equation.

Wait, let me check the other options just to be sure. Option B is n=5/20, which is 0.25. That doesn't make sense because we're looking for a larger number than 20. Option C is 5xn=20. That would mean n is 4, which is even smaller, so that's not right.

Option D is 20+5=n, so n=25. But 25 isn't five times 20. Five times 20 is 100, so that's way off. Option E is n=20-5=15, which is even less, so no.

Option F is 5+20=n, which is 25 again. Same issue as D. Option G is 20/n=5. If I solve for n, that would be n=20/5=4. Nope, that's not right.

Option H is 5n=20. Solving for n gives 4, which is wrong. So yeah, the correct one must be option A: 20x5=n.

The problem states that Mr. Clark's class has 20 students and the entire fourth grade has 5 times as many students. To find the total number of students, n, in the fourth grade, we multiply the number of students in Mr. Clark's class by 5. This gives the equation:

**n = 20 Ã— 5**

Among the options provided, the correct equation is:

A: 20x5=n

All other options either result in incorrect values or do not represent the relationship described in the problem.

Answer: A
