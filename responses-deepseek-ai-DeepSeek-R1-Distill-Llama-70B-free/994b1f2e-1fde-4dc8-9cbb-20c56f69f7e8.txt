Okay, so I have this problem here about calculating the diameter of an iron pipe. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on fluid mechanics, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the problem says the pipe is 10,000 feet long, and oil is flowing at 8.93 cubic feet per second (cfs). The head loss is 75 feet-pound per pound. They also give the kinematic viscosity (v) as 0.0001 ft²/s and the roughness (epsilon) as 0.00015 ft. I need to find the diameter from the options given.

Wait, head loss. Oh right, head loss in a pipe is usually calculated using some form of the Darcy-Weisbach equation. The formula is h_f = (f * L * v²) / (2gD), where f is the friction factor. But wait, the units here might be tricky because sometimes people use different forms depending on units. Oh, but I think the formula I remember is h_f = (f L v²)/(2gD). Or wait, maybe it's h_f = (f L (Q/(A))²)/(2gD). Because velocity v is Q/A, but maybe I should express it in terms of flow rate.

Wait, let me clarify. The Darcy-Weisbach equation is h_f = (f * L * V²) / (2gD), where V is the average velocity. But V is also equal to Q/A, where Q is the volumetric flow rate (which is 8.93 cfs here), and A is the cross-sectional area of the pipe.

So, substituting V with Q/A, h_f becomes (f L (Q/(A))²) / (2gD). But A is π D² /4, so substituting A, we get (f L (Q/(π D²/4))²) / (2gD). Let me square that term: (Q/(π D²/4))² = (16 Q²) / (π² D^4). So putting it all together, h_f = (f L (16 Q²) ) / (2gD * π² D^4). Wait, let's see the denominator. It's 2gD multiplied by the denominator from A squared, right? So the denominator would be 2gD * (π² D^4 / 16), because A squared is (π D²/4)^2 = π² D^4 /16. So h_f becomes (f L * 16 Q²) / (2 g D * π² D^4 /16). Wait, no, I think I made a mistake in substitution. Let me try again.

Wait, perhaps it's better to express V in terms of Q and A. So V = Q/A = Q/(π D²/4) = 4 Q/(π D²). Then V^2 is (16 Q²)/(π² D^4). So substituting into h_f: h_f = (f L * (16 Q^2)/(π² D^4)) ) / (2gD). Simplify the denominator: 2gD. So h_f = (f L 16 Q²) / (2gD * π² D^4) )

Wait, let me factor that correctly. So numerator is f * L * 16 Q². Denominator is 2 g D * π² D^4. So that's 2 g π² D^5. So h_f = (16 f L Q²) / (2 g π² D^5). Simplify 16/2 to 8: so h_f = (8 f L Q²) / (g π² D^5).

Hmm, but this is getting a bit complicated. Alternatively, maybe I should use the formula in terms of Q. Alternatively, I might be overcomplicating. Let me think about the units. Wait, the head loss is given as 75 ft-lb/lb, which is 75 ft (since ft-lb/lb simplifies to ft because lb cancels out). So h_f =75 ft.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look up the Darcy-Weisbach equation again. Alternatively, I remember that for laminar flow, the friction factor f is 16/Re, and for turbulent, it's more complicated, perhaps using the Colebrook-White equation. But I'm not sure if the flow is laminar or turbulent here.

Wait, the Reynolds number Re is (V D)/v. But V is Q/A, which is 4Q/(π D²). So Re = (4 Q/(π D²)) * D / v = (4 Q)/(π D v).

Hmm, but since I don't know D yet, perhaps I can't compute Re directly. But given the values, maybe I can assume it's in the turbulent region, so I should use the Colebrook equation for f.

The Colebrook equation is 1/sqrt(f) = 2 log(e/(e* D)) + 1.20* something. Wait, no, the correct form is 1/sqrt(f) = 2 log( (ε)/(3.7 D) ) + 1.20, but I might be mixing it up. Alternatively, the formula is 1/√f = 2 log( (D/(2 ε)) ) + something. Wait, perhaps it's better expressed as:

1/√f = 2 log( (D/(2 ε)) ) + 1.14, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, maybe it's 1/√f = 2 log( (D/(ε)) /3.7 ), or something along those lines. I'm getting a bit confused here. Wait, perhaps I should look up the exact form.

Wait, no, I can't look it up, but I think the Colebrook-White equation is expressed as:

1/√f = 2 log( (D/(2 ε)) ) + 1.14

Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, it's 1/√f = 2 log( (ε/(3.7 D)) ) + 1.0, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

1/√f = 2 log( (k_s)/(3.7 D H)} ) + something. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up terms. Alternatively, perhaps the correct form is:

1/√f = 2 log( (D/(2 ε)) ) + 1.14

Wait, I think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should proceed with the Darcy equation and express f in terms of Re and the relative roughness.

Wait, another approach: since we have the head loss, we can write the Darcy equation as h_f = f (L/D) (V^2)/(2g). So h_f = (f L V²) / (2g D). Then, solving for f: f = (2 g D h_f) / (L V²). But I can express V as Q/A, which is Q/(π D²/4) = 4 Q/(π D²). So V = 4 Q/(π D²).

Substituting V into the equation:

f = (2 g D h_f) / (L ( (4 Q)/(π D^2) )^2 )

Simplify the denominator: (4 Q/(π D²))^2 = 16 Q²/(π² D^4). So denominator becomes L * 16 Q²/(π² D^4).

So f = (2 g D h_f * π² D^4) ) / (L * 16 Q² )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

f = (2 g D h_f π² D^4) ) / (16 L Q^2 )

Which can be written as:

f = (2 g π² D^5 h_f ) ) / (16 L Q^2 )

Simplify 2/16 to 1/8:

f = (g π² D^5 h_f ) / (8 L Q^2 )

Hmm, but I'm not sure if this is getting me anywhere. Wait, perhaps I can rearrange the Darcy equation to solve for D.

Alternatively, maybe using the formula for head loss in terms of Q, D, etc.

Wait, I think another approach is better. Let's consider that for incompressible flow, the Darcy-Weisbach equation can be written as:

h_f = (f L Q^2) / ( (2 g D^5) (π²/4) ) )

Wait, perhaps a more straightforward formula is:

h_f = (f L Q^2) / ( (π²/4) (2 g D^5) ) )

Wait, maybe I should write it as h_f = (f L Q^2) / ( (π² * 2 g D^5)/4 ) )

Which would make h_f = (4 f L Q^2) / (π² 2 g D^5 )

Simplify 4/2 to 2: h_f = (2 f L Q^2) / (π² g D^5 )

Then, solving for D^5:

D^5 = (2 f L Q^2) / (π² g h_f )

Thus, D = [ (2 f L Q^2) / (π² g h_f ) ]^(1/5)

But I still don't know f, the friction factor. So I need another equation involving f.

The friction factor f can be found using the Colebrook equation, which relates f to the Reynolds number Re and the relative roughness (ε/D).

The Colebrook equation is:

1/√f = 2 log( (D/(2 ε)) ) + 1.14

Wait, no, perhaps I got the form wrong. Alternatively, it's:

1/√f = 2 log( (D/(ε)) / (3.7) ) ) + 1.0

Wait, perhaps it's better to express it correctly. The correct form of the Colebrook equation is:

1/√f = 2 log( (D/(2 ε)) ) + 1.14

But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, another version I've seen is:

1/√f = 2 log( (ε)/(3.7 D) ) + 1.0

Hmm, perhaps I should think again. Let me try to get the correct form.

Wait, the correct form of the Colebrook-White equation is:

1/√f = 2 log( (D/(2 ε)) ) + 1.14

Wait, no, I think that's the wrong way around. Let me think: when the pipe is smooth (ε approaches 0), the friction factor should approach the smooth pipe (laminar or turbulent smooth). For smooth pipes, in turbulent flow, the friction factor is given by the Blasius formula: f = 0.316/Re^(1/4) for Re between 4e3 and 1e5.

Wait, but if I don't know Re, perhaps I need to make an assumption. Alternatively, maybe I can assume that the flow is turbulent, and then use the Colebrook equation to find f in terms of Re and ε/D.

Wait, another approach: the Reynolds number Re = V D / v. Since V = Q/A = 4 Q/(π D²), then Re = (4 Q D)/(π D² v) ) = (4 Q)/(π D v).

We can write Re = (4 Q) / (π D v )

Hmm, but without knowing D, I can't compute Re directly. So perhaps I should make an iterative approach. Let me outline the steps:

1. Assume a value for D.
2. Compute Re using Re = (4 Q)/(π D v )
3. Compute the relative roughness (ε/D).
4. Use the Colebrook equation to compute f.
5. Plug f into the Darcy equation and compute h_f.
6. Compare computed h_f to the given 75 ft. Adjust D and repeat.

But this might take a while without a calculator, especially since I'm just thinking through it. Alternatively, maybe I can find an expression that allows me to solve for D without iteration.

Wait, perhaps I can combine the equations. Let's write down all the equations.

We have:

h_f = (f L Q^2) / ( (2 g D^5) (π^2/4) )

Wait, maybe rearranging:

h_f = (f L Q^2) * 4 / (2 g D^5 π^2 )

Which simplifies to h_f = (2 f L Q^2) / (g D^5 π² )

From this, solving for D^5:

D^5 = (2 f L Q^2) / (g h_f π² )

So D = [ (2 f L Q^2) / (g h_f π² ) ]^(1/5 )

But f depends on Re and ε/D, which complicates things.

Wait, perhaps I can express f in terms of Re and then substitute Re in terms of D.

Wait, from the Colebrook equation, f can be expressed in terms of Re and (ε/D).

But without knowing D, it's tricky. Let me think about the Colebrook equation again. The equation is:

1/√f = 2 log( (D/(2 ε)) ) + 1.14

But wait, no, the correct form is:

1/√f = 2 log( (D/(2 ε)) ) + 1.14

Wait, maybe that's correct. Alternatively, perhaps it's:

1/√f = 2 log( (D/(ε)) )/(2 π) ) + something. Hmm, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to write the correct form.

After a quick thought, the correct Colebrook equation is:

1/√f = 2 log( (D/(2 ε)) ) + 1.14

Wait, perhaps that's the correct form. Let me proceed with that.

So, 1/√f = 2 log(D/(2 ε)) + 1.14

Let me compute (D/(2 ε)) as (D)/(2 * 0.00015 ft) ) = D/(0.0003 ft). But without knowing D, I can't compute this term yet.

Wait, but perhaps I can express D in terms of f from the Darcy equation, then substitute into the Colebrook equation. That would give me an equation in f only, which I can solve numerically.

But this seems complicated without a calculator. Let me see if I can make some approximations.

Alternatively, perhaps I can assume that the flow is in the fully rough zone, where friction factor f depends only on the relative roughness. But I'm not sure if that's applicable here. For fully rough flow, f is given by f = (1/4) log( (ε)/(3.7 D) ) )^2, but I'm not certain.

Wait, no, for fully rough flow, the friction factor is given by the Nikuradse's formula: f = (1/(4 log( (ε)/(3.7 D) )))^2 *something. Alternatively, perhaps it's f ≈ (1/ (2 log( (D)/(2 ε)) ))^2 ), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the flow isn't in the fully rough zone. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should first calculate the Reynolds number assuming a certain diameter to see if the flow is laminar or turbulent.

But without knowing D, it's a bit of a dead end. Let me think: perhaps I can make a first guess for D, compute Re, and see if it's laminar or turbulent.

Wait, for oil, which is more viscous than water. Let me see: the given v is 0.0001 ft²/s. Let me recall that for water, v is about 1e-5 ft²/s at room temperature. So oil is more viscous, with v ten times higher, so Re will be lower.

Wait, let me pick a D from the options to make a rough calculation. Let's pick option E:21.6 inches. Let me convert that to feet: 21.6/12 = 1.8 ft. So D=1.8 ft.

Then, compute Re: Re = (4 Q)/(π D v ) = (4 * 8.93 cfs ) / ( π * 1.8 ft * 0.0001 ft²/s )

Compute numerator: 4 * 8.93 = 35.72.

Denominator: π *1.8 *0.0001 = approx 0.5655 *0.0001 = 0.00005655.

So Re = 35.72 / 0.00005655 ≈ 35.72 / 5.655e-5 ≈ 632,000.

That's a high Reynolds number, so the flow is turbulent.

So, in this case, the Colebrook equation applies.

So, let's proceed with that.

Now, using the Darcy equation:

h_f = (f L Q^2) / ( (2 g D^5) (π^2/4) )

Wait, perhaps it's easier to write the Darcy equation as:

h_f = (f L V^2) / (2g D )

And V = Q/A = Q/( (π D^2)/4 ) = 4 Q/(π D^2 )

So V^2 = (16 Q^2)/(π^2 D^4 )

Substituting into Darcy:

h_f = (f L * 16 Q^2 ) / ( 2 g D * π^2 D^4 )

Which simplifies to h_f = (8 f L Q^2 ) / ( g π^2 D^5 )

Solving for D^5:

D^5 = (8 f L Q^2 ) / ( g π^2 h_f )

Thus,

D = [ (8 f L Q^2 ) / ( g π^2 h_f ) ]^(1/5 )

Now, plug in the known values.

Given:

h_f =75 ft,

L=10,000 ft,

Q=8.93 cfs,

g=32.2 ft/s²,

v=0.0001 ft²/s,

ε=0.00015 ft.

So,

D = [ (8 f *10,000 * (8.93)^2 ) / (32.2 * π^2 *75 ) ]^(1/5 )

Compute the numerator and denominator:

Compute 8 f *10,000: 8 *10,000 = 80,000, so 80,000 f.

Multiply by (8.93)^2: 8.93^2 = approx 79.7. So 80,000 f *79.7 = 6,376,000 f.

Denominator: 32.2 * π² *75.

Compute π² ≈9.8696.
