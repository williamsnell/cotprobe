Okay, so I've got this math problem here: multiply -8 by -4. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when you multiply two negative numbers, the result is positive. But wait, why is that? Let me try to recall.

Oh right, the rules for multiplying negatives go like this: positive times positive is positive, negative times negative is positive, and negative times positive is negative. So in this case, since both numbers are negative, the product should be positive.

Wait, so the question is -8 multiplied by -4. Let me do the actual multiplication first without worrying about the signs. 8 times 4 is 32. So the absolute values give me 32. Now, because both are negative, the result is positive. So that would make it 32.

Looking at the options, option I is 32. Let me check the other options to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Option B is 16, which is half of 32. Did I do the multiplication correctly? 8 times 4 is definitely 32, so that's right. So the positive version is 32, which is option I.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of it on the number line. If I have a debt of 8 and it increases by a debt of 4 each time, how much do I have after four times? Wait, that might be a bit confusing. Alternatively, think of temperature: if it's -8 degrees and it drops by 4 degrees each hour, after two hours, it would be -16, but that's addition, not multiplication. Hmm, maybe that's not the best way.

Another way to remember is using the phrase "negative times negative is positive". So two negatives make a positive. So yeah, the product is positive 32.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up the numbers. -8 times -4. Yeah, 8*4 is 32, and both negatives cancel out to positive. So the answer is 32, which is option I.

The product of −8 and −4 is calculated by first multiplying their absolute values: 8 × 4 = 32. Since both numbers are negative, the result is positive. Therefore, the product is 32, which corresponds to option I.

Answer: I
