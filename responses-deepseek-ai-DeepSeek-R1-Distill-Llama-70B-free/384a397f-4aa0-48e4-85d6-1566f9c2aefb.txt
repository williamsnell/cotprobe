Okay, so I'm trying to solve this probability problem. Let me read it again to understand what's being asked.

The bakery has a mean daily demand of 2,500 loaves with a standard deviation of 225. Every morning, they bake 3,000 loaves. I need to find the probability that they'll run out of bread today. Oh wait, running out means the demand exceeds the supply they baked, right?

So, the key here is that the demand is normally distributed. That's important because I can use Z-scores and the standard normal distribution table to find probabilities.

Let me think about the variables:

- Mean (μ) = 2500
- Standard deviation (σ) = 225
- Baked amount = 3000

We need the probability that demand (X) is greater than 3000. So, P(X > 3000).

Since the demand is normally distributed, I'll convert 3000 into a Z-score. The formula for Z is Z = (X - μ) / σ.

Plugging in the numbers:

Z = (3000 - 2500) / 225 = 500 / 225 ≈ 2.2222.

Wait, let me check that division. 225 times 2 is 450, and 500-450 is 50. So 50/225 is 2/9, which is approximately 0.2222. So yes, Z is about 2.2222.

Now, I need to find the probability that Z is greater than 2.2222. In the standard normal distribution, this is the area to the right of Z=2.22.

I remember that the Z-table gives the area to the left of Z, so P(Z < 2.22) is the value I can look up, and then I subtract that from 1 to get the area to the right.

Looking up Z=2.22 in the Z-table. Let's see... For Z=2.22, the table might give me around 0.987. But I should be precise. Let me think—standard tables usually have Z values up to two decimal places. So maybe 2.22 corresponds to 0.9873 or something. Wait, another thought: 2.22 is between 2.2 and 2.3.

Looking at Z=2.2, the cumulative probability is about 0.9772. Z=2.22 is a bit higher. Let me see: I think for Z=2.22, it's 0.9873. Hmm, but maybe I'm mixing numbers up. Alternatively, I can use a calculator or a more precise method, but since I'm doing this mentally, let's approximate.

Alternatively, if I recall the 68-95-99.7 rule, 2 standard deviations cover about 95% of the data, and 3 standard deviations cover 99.7%. So 2.22 is a little beyond 2, which is 95%, so maybe around 98.7% or so.

Wait, another approach: the value of Z=2.22. So the area to the left is about 0.987, so the area to the right is 1 - 0.987 = 0.013. So about 1.3% chance. Looking at the options, D is 0.0132, which seems close.

But wait, let me make sure. I might have made a mistake in the Z calculation. Let me double-check:

X is 3000. μ is 2500. So 3000 - 2500 = 500. Divided by 225 gives 500/225. Let's calculate that again. 225 times 2 is 450, so 500-450 is 50. So 50/225 is 0.2222. So yes, Z is about 2.2222.

Alternatively, perhaps using a more accurate Z-table or a calculator. For Z=2.22, let me think. Let me see, the exact value from a table: for Z=2.22, the cumulative probability is approximately 0.9873. So the area beyond is 1 - 0.9873 = 0.0127, which is about 0.0127. But looking at the options, option D is 0.0132, which is very close.

Wait, another thought. Maybe I should use a calculator for the exact value of the Z-score. Because 2.2222 could be more precisely calculated. Alternatively, perhaps the exact value is 2.2222, which is 20/9. But I think that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps using interpolation. For Z=2.22, the exact value from a table might give a more precise number.

Wait, perhaps I should use the Z-table with more decimal places. For example, Z=2.22 is 0.9873, and Z=2.23 is about 0.9877. So the exact probability would be around 0.9873, leading to 1 - 0.9873 = 0.0127. But the option D is 0.0132, which is close but not exactly matching. Hmm.

Wait another thought: perhaps I made a mistake in the Z calculation. Let me recalculate:

X = 3000, μ=2500, σ=225.

Z = (3000 - 2500) / 225 = 500 / 225.

Calculating 500 ÷ 225:

225 × 2 = 450. 500 - 450 = 50. So 50/225 = 0.22222... So 2.22222.

So Z = 2.2222.

Looking this up in a standard normal table. Let me see:

For Z=2.22, the value is 0.9873.

Wait, I think that's correct.

So the probability that X > 3000 is 1 - 0.9873 = 0.0127.

Looking at the options, D is 0.0132, which is 0.0132. That's very close but not exactly the same as 0.0127.

Wait, perhaps I should check whether the Z-value is 2.22 or more precisely, perhaps 2.2222. Let me check with a calculator.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact Z is 2.2222, but the table gives for Z=2.22 as 0.9873 and Z=2.23 as 0.9877. So for 2.2222, which is 2.22 + 0.0022, perhaps the cumulative probability is approximately 0.9873 + (0.0022 * (0.9877-0.9873))/0.01. Wait, no. Wait, the difference between Z=2.22 and Z=2.23 is 0.0004 (0.9877 - 0.9873). So per 0.01 increment in Z, the cumulative increases by 0.0004.

So for Z=2.22 + 0.0022, which is 0.2222 of the way from 2.22 to 2.23, the cumulative probability would be 0.9873 + (0.2222 * 0.0004). Wait, no, that's not right. Because the increment is 0.01, and each 0.01 adds 0.0004. So for 0.0022, it's 0.0004 * (0.0022 / 0.01) = 0.000088. So the cumulative would be approximately 0.9873 + 0.000088 ≈ 0.987388.

So the cumulative probability for Z=2.2222 is approximately 0.987388. Therefore, the probability that X > 3000 is 1 - 0.987388 ≈ 0.012612, which is approximately 0.0126. 

Looking at the options, D is 0.0132, which is 0.0132. That's very close. But none of the options exactly match 0.0126. Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

D: 0.0132

Hmm, perhaps the exact calculation using a calculator would give a slightly different value. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the precise Z-table values. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Z calculation.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps I should use the continuity correction since the demand is discrete (loaves are whole numbers), but in this case, the demand is treated as a continuous variable, so maybe the continuity correction isn't necessary here. Or perhaps it is. Wait, but the question says the demand is normally distributed, which is continuous, so perhaps continuity correction isn't needed.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the bakery having exactly 3000 loaves. So the probability of running out is when demand is strictly greater than 3000. So we're looking for P(X ≥ 3001), but since X is continuous, it's the same as P(X > 3000).

So perhaps the initial approach is correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the Z value is calculated correctly, but I'm misapplying the Z-table. Let me think. The Z-table gives P(Z ≤ z), so for Z=2.22, it's 0.9873, so P(Z > 2.22) is 1 - 0.9873 = 0.0127, which is approximately 0.0127. So the closest option is D: 0.0132.

Alternatively, perhaps the exact value using a calculator for Z=2.2222 is 0.0129, which would be close to D's 0.0132.

Wait, perhaps using a calculator, let me compute the exact value of P(Z > 2.2222). Using the formula for standard normal distribution, the probability can be found using the error function, but I don't remember the exact steps. Alternatively, I can use a calculator or software. But since I can't do that right now, I'll proceed with the approximation.

So, I think the correct answer is D: 0.0132.

To determine the probability that the bakery will run out of bread today, we need to calculate the probability that the demand exceeds the baked amount of 3,000 loaves. The demand is normally distributed with a mean (μ) of 2,500 loaves and a standard deviation (σ) of 225 loaves. 

### Step 1: Convert the baked amount to a Z-score
The Z-score is calculated using the formula:

\[
Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}
\]

Here, \(X = 3000\), \(\mu = 2500\), and \(\sigma = 225\). Substituting these values:

\[
Z = \frac{3000 - 2500}{225} = \frac{500}{225} \approx 2.2222
\]

### Step 2: Interpret the Z-score
The Z-score of 2.2222 indicates how many standard deviations the baked amount (3,000 loaves) is above the mean demand (2,500 loaves). Since the demand is normally distributed, we can use the standard normal distribution table to find the probability that the demand exceeds 3,000 loaves.

### Step 3: Find the probability
The standard normal distribution table provides the cumulative probability \(P(Z \leq z)\), which is the area to the left of the Z-score. For \(Z = 2.22\), the cumulative probability is approximately 0.9873. To find the probability that the demand exceeds 3,000 loaves, we calculate:

\[
P(X > 3000) = P(Z > 2.2222) = 1 - P(Z \leq 2.2222) = 1 - 0.9873 = 0.0127
\]

### Step 4: Match the closest option
The calculated probability (\(0.0127\)) is closest to option D (\(0.0132\)). This represents a 1.32% chance that the bakery will run out of bread today.

### Final Answer:
D: 0.0132
