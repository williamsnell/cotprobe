Question:

A neighborhood homeowners' association hired a security company to provide an armed guard to patrol the neighborhood. One evening, the guard saw a young man stealing a rake that a homeowner in the neighborhood had left outside in his yard. The guard ran toward the young man. Seeing the guard, the young man dropped the rake and began to flee. Believing that the young man was about to escape, the guard pulled out his gun and fired a shot at the young man. The bullet struck the young man in the arm. If the young man asserts a claim against the security company for damages for his injuries, the young man will

Options:

A: prevail, because the guard did not give a warning that he had a gun and was about to shoot.
B: not prevail, because the homeowner's association approved the use of force in such situations.
C: prevail, because the guard should have called the police instead of taking matters into his own hands.
D: not prevail, because the guard acted within his rights to protect property within the neighborhood.
E: prevail, because the guard used unreasonable force to protect the homeowner's property.
F: not prevail, because the young man was engaged in theft when he was shot.
G: not prevail, because the injury was a result of the young man's own criminal activity.
H: not prevail, because the young man was trespassing on the homeowner's property.

Okay, so I've got this question here about a security guard shooting someone who was stealing a rake. Hmm, I need to figure out whether the young man can successfully sue the security company for his injuries. Let's break this down step by step.

First, the scenario: A neighborhood hired a security company with an armed guard. The guard sees a young man stealing a rake left outside. The guard runs towards him, the young man drops the rake and flees. The guard, thinking he's about to escape, shoots him in the arm. Now, the young man is suing the security company.

I think the main issue here is the use of force by the guard. Specifically, was the guard justified in using deadly force in this situation? Because if he wasn't, then the security company might be liable.

I remember that in tort law, the use of force is generally allowed when it's reasonable and necessary. For security personnel or law enforcement, they can use force to prevent a crime, but there are limits. Especially regarding deadly force. I think deadly force is only permissible when there's an imminent threat of serious harm or death.

In this case, the guard shot someone who was stealing a rake. Theft is a property crime, not a violent one. The young man was fleeing after dropping the rake, so he wasn't posing an immediate threat to anyone's safety. He wasn't armed, as far as we know, and wasn't threatening the guard or anyone else.

So, the guard might have used excessive force. Firing a gun at someone just for stealing and trying to run away doesn't seem proportionate. The guard's duty is to protect property, but not at the cost of using deadly force when it's not necessary.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the guard didn't give a warning. I'm not sure if a warning is required in every situation, but it's probably a factor. If the guard didn't warn, maybe that's part of why the force was unreasonable.

Option B says the HOA approved the use of force. But even if they did, that doesn't necessarily make it legal. The guard's actions have to comply with the law regardless of what the HOA says.

Option C suggests the guard should have called the police. That makes sense because police are trained to handle such situations, and the guard's role might not include using deadly force for minor crimes.

Option D says the guard acted within his rights to protect property. But I don't think you can shoot someone for stealing a rake; that's not a situation where deadly force is justified.

Option E states the guard used unreasonable force. That aligns with what I was thinking earlier. Since the threat wasn't imminent or severe, the force was unreasonable.

Option F says the young man was engaged in theft, so he can't prevail. But the issue is whether the response was appropriate. Theft doesn't automatically justify being shot.

Option G talks about the injury being due to his own criminal activity. But again, that's about the cause, not whether the guard's action was lawful.

Option H mentions trespassing. The young man was on the homeowner's property without permission, but again, does that justify shooting him? Trespassing is a minor offense, and deadly force isn't usually allowed unless there's a threat to safety.

So, putting it all together, the guard used unreasonable force because the young man wasn't posing a threat that would justify deadly force. Therefore, the young man would prevail in his claim against the security company.

Looking back at the options, E seems correct because it's about unreasonable force to protect property. But wait, another angle: the guard was acting in the scope of his employment, so the company could be vicariously liable if the guard was negligent or used excessive force.

Alternatively, I should make sure if the guard's actions meet the standard for excessive force. In many jurisdictions, security guards aren't given the same latitude as police officers. So even if a police officer might have certain privileges, a security guard might not.

I think the key point is that the guard used deadly force in response to a non-violent felony (theft). The law typically requires that deadly force only be used when there's a risk of serious bodily harm, which wasn't the case here. So the young man could argue that the force was excessive and that the guard and the security company are liable.

So the correct answer should be E: prevail, because the guard used unreasonable force to protect property.

The question revolves around whether a security guard's use of deadly force against a young man stealing a rake was justified, and whether the young man can successfully sue the security company for his injuries. The key issue is whether the guard's actions constituted reasonable or excessive force.

The guard shot the young man while he was fleeing after dropping the rake. Theft is a property crime, and the young man was not posing an imminent threat of serious harm or death. Deadly force is generally only permissible when there is an immediate threat to safety, which was not present here. The guard's actions, therefore, likely constitute unreasonable force, as shooting someone for stealing a rake and fleeing is disproportionate to the threat posed.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: While a warning might be a factor, the lack of one does not solely determine the reasonableness of the force used.
- **B**: The HOA's approval does not legalize the guard's actions if they exceed lawful limits.
- **C**: Suggesting the guard should have called the police is valid, but the core issue is the unreasonableness of using deadly force.
- **D**: The guard was not within his rights to use deadly force for a non-violent property crime.
- **E**: This correctly identifies that the guard used unreasonable force, as the situation did not justify deadly force.
- **F**: Engagement in theft does not justify the use of deadly force unless there is an imminent threat.
- **G**: The injury's cause does not negate the guard's liability if the force used was unlawful.
- **H**: Trespassing, like theft, does not justify deadly force without an imminent threat.

The guard's use of deadly force was unreasonable, as the young man posed no immediate threat of serious harm. Therefore, the young man would prevail in his claim against the security company.

**Answer: E**
