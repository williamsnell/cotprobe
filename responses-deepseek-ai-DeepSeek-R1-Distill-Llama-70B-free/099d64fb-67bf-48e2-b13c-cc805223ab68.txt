Okay, so I'm trying to find the area between two functions, f(x) and g(x), from x=1 to x=3. The functions are f(x) = x² -4x +10 and g(x) =4x -x². Hmm, I remember that to find the area between two curves, I need to integrate the top function minus the bottom function over the interval.

First, I should figure out which function is on top in the given interval. Maybe I can find where they intersect to make sure. So set f(x) equal to g(x):

x² -4x +10 =4x -x²

Let me bring all terms to one side. Add x² to both sides and subtract 4x:

x² + x² -4x -4x +10 = 0 → 2x² -8x +10 =0.

Divide everything by 2: x² -4x +5 =0. Let's compute the discriminant: b²-4ac = 16 -20 = -4. Oh, so no real roots. That means the two functions don't cross each other between 1 and 3, or anywhere else. So one function is always above the other in that interval.

Wait, but which one is on top? Maybe I can pick a point between 1 and 3, say x=2, and plug into both functions.

f(2) = (4) -8 +10 = 6.

g(2)=8 -4=4. So at x=2, f(x) is higher. So f(x) is the top function and g(x) is the bottom.

So the area should be the integral from 1 to 3 of [f(x) - g(x)] dx.

Let me compute f(x) - g(x):

(x² -4x +10) - (4x -x²) = x² -4x +10 -4x +x² = 2x² -8x +10.

So the integral becomes ∫ from 1 to3 of (2x² -8x +10) dx.

Let me integrate term by term:

The integral of 2x² is (2/3)x³.

Integral of -8x is -4x².

Integral of 10 is 10x.

So the antiderivative is (2/3)x³ -4x² +10x.

Now evaluate this from 1 to 3.

Compute at x=3:

(2/3)*(27) -4*(9) +10*3 → (54/3) -36 +30 → 18 -36 +30 = 12.

Compute at x=1:

(2/3)*(1) -4*(1) +10*(1) → (2/3) -4 +10 → (2/3) +6 = 20/3 ≈6.6667.

Subtract the lower limit from the upper: 12 - (20/3) = (36/3 -20/3) = 16/3 ≈5.333.

Wait, but looking at the options, option G is 5.333. So that's the answer.

But wait, did I do everything right? Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I should recompute the antiderivatives and calculations.

Antiderivative F(x) = (2/3)x³ -4x² +10x.

At x=3:

2/3 *27 = 18.

-4*(9)= -36.

10*3=30.

18 -36 +30 = 12. Correct.

At x=1:

2/3 *1 = 2/3.

-4*(1) =-4.

10*1=10.

So 2/3 -4 +10 = 2/3 +6 = 20/3.

So 12 -20/3 = (36/3 -20/3) =16/3, which is 5 and 1/3, so 5.333. So yeah, option G.

To find the area of the region between the graphs of \( f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 10 \) and \( g(x) = 4x - x^2 \) over the interval \( 1 \leq x \leq 3 \), we first determine which function is on top. By evaluating both functions at \( x = 2 \), we find \( f(2) = 6 \) and \( g(2) = 4 \), indicating that \( f(x) \) is above \( g(x) \) in this interval. Thus, the area is given by the integral of \( f(x) - g(x) \) from \( x = 1 \) to \( x = 3 \).

The difference \( f(x) - g(x) \) is:

\[
f(x) - g(x) = (x^2 - 4x + 10) - (4x - x^2) = 2x^2 - 8x + 10.
\]

The area is then:

\[
\text{Area} = \int_1^3 (2x^2 - 8x + 10) \, dx.
\]

The antiderivative of \( 2x^2 - 8x + 10 \) is:

\[
F(x) = \frac{2}{3}x^3 - 4x^2 + 10x.
\]

Evaluating \( F(x) \) at the bounds:

- At \( x = 3 \):  
\[
F(3) = \frac{2}{3}(27) - 4(9) + 10(3) = 18 - 36 + 30 = 12.
\]

- At \( x = 1 \):  
\[
F(1) = \frac{2}{3}(1) - 4(1) + 10(1) = \frac{2}{3} - 4 + 10 = \frac{20}{3}.
\]

The area is the difference:

\[
\text{Area} = F(3) - F(1) = 12 - \frac{20}{3} = \frac{36}{3} - \frac{20}{3} = \frac{16}{3} \approx 5.333.
\]

Thus, the area of the region is approximately \( 5.333 \), corresponding to option **G**.
