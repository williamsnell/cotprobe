Okay, so I've got this problem here about removing water from an air-water mixture. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on diffusion, but let's see if I can work through this.

The question says the mixture is 35% water by volume. So that means the concentration of water is pretty high. Then, this mixture diffuses into a still air section that's 0.2 inches long. After that, the water is completely removed by absorption, and at the absorption plane, the concentration is negligible. The system is at 1 atm and 59°C.

I remember that diffusion rate can be calculated using Fick's Law. Fick's Law is something like the diffusion flux is proportional to the concentration gradient. The formula I think is J = -D * (dc/dx), where J is the flux, D is the diffusion coefficient, and dc/dx is the concentration gradient.

Wait, but I also need to consider the units here. The options are in lb-mole per ft² per hour. So I need to make sure the units work out right.

First, I need to find the diffusion coefficient for water in air. I don't remember the exact value, but I think at around 60°C, it's in the range of 0.25 to 0.3 cm²/s. Let me think, maybe it's approximately 0.28 cm²/s at 59°C. I'll use D = 0.28 cm²/s for now.

But wait, the units for D need to be in the right system. Since the answer choices are in lb-mole/ft²-hr, I should probably convert D to ft²/hr. Let me check the conversion factors.

1 cm is 0.01 meters, which is 0.03314 feet. So 1 cm² is (0.03314 ft)^2 = 0.001098 ft². And since 1 second is 1/3600 hours, 1 cm²/s is 0.001098 ft²/(1/3600) hr. So that's 0.001098 *3600 ft²/hr. Let me calculate that: 0.001098 *3600 = approx 3.9528 ft²/hr.

Wait wait, no. Wait, D is in cm²/s, so 0.28 cm²/s. So 0.28 * (0.001098 ft²/cm²) * (3600 s/hr) = 0.28 * 3.9528 ft²/hr.

Let me compute that: 0.28 * 3.9528 ≈ 1.1068 ft²/hr. So D ≈ 1.1068 ft²/hr.

Wait, maybe I should double-check that calculation. Let me compute 0.28 cm²/s to ft²/hr.

1 cm = 0.03314 ft, so 1 cm² = (0.03314)^2 = 0.001098 ft².

So 0.28 cm²/s = 0.28 * 0.001098 ft²/s.

Multiply by seconds per hour: 0.28 * 0.001098 * 3600.

0.28 * 0.001098 is approx 0.00030784. Multiply by 3600 gives 0.00030784 * 3600 ≈ 1.108.

So D ≈ 1.108 ft²/hr. Got it.

Next, I need to find the concentration gradient. The concentration is 35% water by volume. I think I need to find the molar concentration, which is moles per volume.

Wait, the ideal gas law might be useful here. PV = nRT. So n/V = P/(RT). At 1 atm and 59°C (which is 332.15 K), R is the gas constant.

But wait, R is 10.7316 psi-ft³/(lb-mole·R). Wait no, more accurately, R is 10.7316 (lbf·ft³)/(lb-mole·R) when pressure is in psf. Or perhaps I should use R in different units.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the molar concentration in lb-mole per ft³. Let me think.

Atmospheric pressure is 1 atm = 14.696 psi. Since 1 psi is 144 psfg (pounds per square foot gauge), 14.696 psi is 14.696 * 144 psfg = 2116.64 psfg.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to use R in units that match. Let me recall R is 10.7316 (ft·lbf)/(lb-mole·R). So units-wise, for n/V (lb-mole/ft³), since P is in psf (lb/ft²), R is (ft·lbf)/(lb-mole·R)), so P/(R*T) would give (lb/ft²) * (lb-mole·R)/(ft·lbf)) * (1/R) ) → let me think.

Wait, maybe I should better write the units:

P is in lb/ft² (since 1 atm is 14.7 psi, which is about 2116 lb/ft²).

R is 10.7316 (ft·lbf)/(lb-mole·R). Wait, but temperature is in Rankine, so 59°C is 59 + 273.15 = 332.15 K, which is 332.15 * 9/5 = 598.67 R.

So, n/V = P/(R*T) → units: (lb/ft²) / [ (ft·lbf/(lb-mole·R)) * R ) ]

Because R is in (ft·lbf)/(lb-mole·R), when multiplied by T in R, it's (ft·lbf)/(lb-mole).

So denominator becomes (ft·lbf)/(lb-mole)).

So n/V → (lb/ft²) / (ft·lbf/lb-mole) ) → (lb/ft²) * (lb-mole * ft)/(lbf) )

Wait, but lb and lbf are different. I think 1 lbf = 1 lb·g, but perhaps I need to account for that. Wait, maybe I should use unit conversion factors.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute molar concentration in moles per m³ and then convert to lb-mole per ft³.

Wait, perhaps another approach. The molar concentration of water in air can be found using the ideal gas law.

At 1 atm, 59°C (332 K), the molar volume of an ideal gas is RT/P.

But R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K). So V = (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K) * 332 K / 1 atm ≈ 27.3 L/mol.

Wait, that's the volume per mole. So concentration is 1/27.3 mol/L. But that's molar concentration in mol/L.

Wait, but the problem states that the mixture is 35% water by volume. So the mole fraction of water is 0.35, assuming ideal behavior.

Wait, but wait, if the volume is 35% water, then mole fraction is 0.35 because for ideal gases, volume fraction equals mole fraction.

So the mole fraction y_water = 0.35.

So the concentration of water is y_water * (P/(R*T)).

Wait, perhaps I should compute the molar concentration (n/V) as (P/(R*T)) * y_water.

Wait, but earlier, I was getting confused with units. Let me try again.

Compute n/V in lb-mole per ft³.

R is 10.7316 ft·lbf/(lb-mole·R). So:

n/V = (P) / (R*T) → P is in lb/ft², R is in ft·lbf/(lb-mole·R), T in Rankine.

So:

n/V = (2116 lb/ft²) / (10.7316 ft·lbf/(lb-mole·R) * 598.67 R)

Wait, 10.7316 * 598.67 ≈ 10.7316 * 600 ≈ 6440 (approx). Let me compute exactly: 598.67 *10.7316 = ?

598.67 *10 =5986.7, 598.67 *0.7316 ≈ 438. So total ≈ 5986.7 + 438 = 6424.7.

So denominator is 6424.7 ft·lbf/(lb-mole).

P is 2116 lb/ft².

So n/V = 2116 / 6424.7 → approximately 0.329 lb-mole/ft³.

Wait, but units: (lb/ft²) / (ft·lbf/(lb-mole)) ) → (lb/ft²) * (lb-mole·ft)/(lbf) )

Wait, lb and lbf are different. 1 lbf = 32.174 lb·ft/(lb_mole·R), but I'm getting confused here. Maybe I should instead use the fact that 1 lbf = 1 lb net force, but perhaps in the unit conversion, we can consider that.

Alternatively, perhaps I should better compute n/V in mol/m³ and then convert to lb-mole/ft³.

Wait, using R as 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K, and T = 332 K.

n/V = P/(R*T) → (1 atm) / (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K * 332 K) → 1/(27.28 L/mol) → approx 0.03667 mol/L.

Since 1 L is 0.0353147 ft³, so 1 mol/L = 28.31685 mol/m³. Wait, no, 1 L = 0.001 m³, so 1 mol/L = 1000 mol/m³.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute in SI units first.

n/V (mol/m³) = (P) / (R*T), where P is in Pascals, R is 8.314 J/mol·K, T in K.

P = 1 atm = 101325 Pa.

So n/V = 101325 / (8.314 * 332.15) → Let me compute denominator: 8.314 * 332 ≈ 2760.

So 101325 / 2760 ≈ 36.7 mol/m³.

Wait, that's 36.7 moles per cubic meter.

But wait, that's the total molar concentration of the gas (air plus water). Since water is 35% by volume, the water concentration is 0.35 * 36.7 ≈ 12.845 mol/m³.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Wait, no, in ideal gases, the partial pressure is proportional to mole fraction. So if the volume fraction is 35%, then the mole fraction is 0.35, so the concentration of water is 0.35 * n/V_total.

So if n/V_total is 36.7 mol/m³, then water is 0.35 * 36.7 ≈ 12.845 mol/m³.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe another approach: The molar concentration of water is equal to (y_water * P)/(R*T), where y_water is the mole fraction.

But perhaps it's easier to work in lb-mole units. Let me try again.

Compute n_water/V in lb-mole/ft³.

Using R = 10.7316 ft·lbf/(lb-mole·R). So units:

n/V = (P) / (R*T) → P in lb/ft², R in ft·lbf/(lb-mole·R), T in R.

So n/V = (2116 lb/ft²) / (10.7316 ft·lbf/(lb-mole·R) * 598.67 R)

Wait, 10.7316 * 598.67 ≈ 6424.7 ft·lbf/(lb-mole).

So n/V = 2116 / 6424.7 → Approximately 0.329 lb-mole/ft³.

But that's the total molar concentration. Since water is 35% by volume, which equals mole fraction, so n_water/V = 0.35 * 0.329 ≈ 0.1152 lb-mole/ft³.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Because 0.35 of the moles are water. So maybe I should compute n_water/V = 0.35 * (P/(R*T)).

Wait, P/(R*T) is the total molar concentration, so 0.329 lb-mole/ft³. Then 0.35 * 0.329 ≈ 0.11515 lb-mole/ft³.

Wait, but earlier when I computed in SI units, I got around 12.8 mol/m³, which is roughly 12.8 * 0.001055 = approx 0.0135 lb-mole/m³. Wait, no, 1 lb-mole is 453.592 moles, so 12.8 mol/m³ is 12.8 / 453.592 ≈ 0.0282 lb-mole/m³. But 1 m³ is 35.3147 ft³, so 0.0282 lb-mole/m³ * 35.3147 ft³/m³ → ≈ 1.0 lb-mole/ft³. Hmm, that doesn't match the 0.115 lb-mole/ft³ from the previous method. Something's wrong here.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused between molar concentrations. Let me think again.

In the first approach, using R in lb units:

n/V = P/(R*T) = (2116 lb/ft²) / (10.7316 ft·lbf/(lb-mole·R) * 598.67 R)

The R in denominator has units (ft·lbf/(lb-mole·R)), multiplied by T in R, gives (ft·lbf/(lb-mole)). So n/V is (lb/ft²) / (ft·lbf/(lb-mole))).

Wait, the units would be (lb/ft²) * (lb-mole * ft)/(lbf) ). But lbf is a force unit, lb is mass.

I think I'm getting stuck here. Maybe it's better to convert the molar concentration from SI units to lb-mole/ft³.

Earlier, I had n_water/V = 12.845 mol/m³. Let me compute that in lb-mole per ft³.

1 lb-mole is 453.592 mol, so 12.845 mol/m³ = 12.845 / 453.592 ≈ 0.0283 lb-mole/m³.

Since 1 m³ = 35.3147 ft³, 0.0283 lb-mole/m³ = 0.0283 * 35.3147 ≈ 1.0 lb-mole/ft³.

Wait, that's way higher than the 0.115 I calculated earlier. There's a discrepancy here. I must be making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the SI calculation. Let me recompute the SI part.

Compute n_water/V in mol/m³.

P = 101325 Pa, R = 8.314 J/mol·K, T = 332 K.

n/V = P/(R*T) = 101325 / (8.314 * 332) → 8.314 * 332 ≈ 2762.

So 101325 / 2762 ≈ 36.7 mol/m³.

But this is the total concentration; water is 35% of that, so 0.35 * 36.7 ≈ 12.845 mol/m³.

Now, converting to lb-mole/ft³:

12.845 mol/m³ = 12.845 / 453.592 ≈ 0.0283 lb-mole/m³.

1 m³ is 35.3147 ft³, so 0.0283 lb-mole/m³ * 35.3147 ft³/m³ → 1.0 lb-mole/ft³.

Wait, so that's about 1.0 lb-mole/ft³ of water.

But when I used the other approach, I got 0.115 lb-mole/ft³. That can't be right. I must have messed up the mole fraction part.

Wait, no, in the first approach, I think I calculated the total molar concentration as 0.329 lb-mole/ft³, then multiplied by 0.35, getting 0.115. But that can't be right because in SI units, I'm getting 1.0 lb-mole/ft³. So I must have made a mistake in the first approach.

Ah, maybe I got the pressure wrong. Wait, 1 atm is 14.7 psi, which is 14.7 lb/in². Wait, but 1 psi is 144 lb/ft² (since 1 ft =12 in, so 12^2=144). So 14.7 psi = 14.7 * 144 lb/ft² = 2116.8 lb/ft². That part I think is correct.

Wait, but in the first approach, I did P/(R*T) → 2116 / (10.7316 * 598.67) → 2116 / 6424 ≈ 0.329 lb-mole/ft³. But according to the SI approach, it should be about 36.7 mol/m³ ≈ 1.0 lb-mole/ft³. So why is there such a big difference?

Ah! Wait, in the first approach, P is in lb/ft², but R is in ft·lbf/(lb-mole·R), and T is in Rankine.

Wait, perhaps I should double-check the units. Let me write them out:

n/V units should be lb-mole/ft³.

P is in lb/ft².

R is in (ft·lbf)/(lb-mole·R).

T is in R.

So n/V = (lb/ft²) / [ (ft·lbf/(lb-mole·R)) * R ) ]

So the R in denominator and numerator cancels. So units:

(lb/ft²) / (ft·lbf/(lb-mole)) → (lb/ft²) * (lb-mole * ft)/(lbf) )

But lbf is a force, which is lb·g where g is acceleration. Hmm, perhaps I'm missing a conversion factor here. I think I need to account for the fact that lbf = lb·g, where g is 32.174 ft/s².

So 1 lbf = 1 lb * 32.174 ft/s².

So in the denominator, ft·lbf becomes ft * lb * ft/s².

Wait, the unit becomes
