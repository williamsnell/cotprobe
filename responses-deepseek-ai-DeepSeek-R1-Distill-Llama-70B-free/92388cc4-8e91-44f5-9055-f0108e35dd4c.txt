Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Alright, let's read it again.

The question is about projectile motion. It's asking at what angle to the horizontal an ideal projectile should be launched so that its horizontal displacement (the range) is equal to its maximum vertical displacement. Hmm, okay, I've studied projectile motion before, so I remember some formulas, but I'm a bit rusty, so I'll have to think carefully.

Let me break this down. In projectile motion, when you launch something at an angle θ, its trajectory is a parabola. The horizontal displacement is called the range, and the maximum vertical displacement is the maximum height it reaches.

So the problem is asking for the angle θ where the range R is equal to the maximum height H. So R = H. I need to find θ such that this condition holds.

I remember the formulas for range and maximum height. Let me jot them down to keep things clear.

The range R of a projectile is given by R = (v² sin(2θ)) / g, where v is the initial speed and g is the acceleration due to gravity. Oh wait, wait, wait. No, I think I might be mixing that up. Let me think again. Oh right, no, the formula is correct. R = (v² sin(2θ))/g. But wait, that's when the projectile lands at the same vertical level from which it was launched, which I think is the case here because the problem doesn't mention any difference in height.

And the maximum height H is given by H = (v² sin²θ)/(2g). Yeah, I remember that.

So the problem states that R = H, so I can set those two expressions equal to each other.

So (v² sin(2θ))/g = (v² sin²θ)/(2g). 

Wait, since both denominators have g, and v² is in both, I can divide both sides by v²/g to simplify. Let's do that.

Dividing both sides by (v²/g) gives: sin(2θ) = (sin²θ)/2.

Now I can write sin(2θ) as 2 sinθ cosθ. So substituting that in:

2 sinθ cosθ = (sin²θ)/2.

Hmm, let's write that down:

2 sinθ cosθ = (sin²θ) / 2.

I can multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator:

4 sinθ cosθ = sin²θ.

Now, let's rearrange terms to bring everything to one side:

4 sinθ cosθ - sin²θ = 0.

Factor out sinθ:

sinθ (4 cosθ - sinθ) = 0.

So, either sinθ = 0 or 4 cosθ - sinθ = 0.

But sinθ = 0 would imply θ = 0°, which makes sense because if you launch it horizontally, the range is zero and the maximum height is also zero. But that's a trivial solution, and I don't think it's the one they're looking for because other angles might satisfy the condition. So let's consider the other equation: 4 cosθ - sinθ = 0.

So 4 cosθ = sinθ.

Divide both sides by cosθ (assuming cosθ ≠ 0, which it isn't here because if cosθ was zero, sinθ would be 1, which would make 4*0 = 1, which isn't true, so that's fine.)

So we get 4 = sinθ / cosθ, which is tanθ. So tanθ = 4.

So θ = arctan(4). Let me calculate arctan(4) to get an idea of the angle. I know that arctan(1) is 45°, arctan(√3) is 60°, and arctan(4) is a bit more than 75°, because tan(75°) is about 3.732, and tan(76°) is around 4, so approximately 76 degrees or so. But looking at the options, I don't see 76°, but let's check the options given.

Looking back at the options:

A: tan–1 4

B: 60°

C: cos–1 (1/g) → Wait, but 1/g is a number. Wait, no, g is 9.8 m/s², so 1/g is about 0.102, and cos inverse of that would be near 84°, but that's a different approach.

Wait, but the options are given, so let's see. Option A is tan inverse 4, which is the angle we found. So option A is the answer.

Wait, but I should make sure I didn't make any mistakes in the algebra. Let me go through the steps again.

We started with R = H:

(v² sin 2θ)/g = (v² sin²θ)/(2g)

Divide both sides by (v²/g):

sin 2θ = (sin²θ)/2

Expressed as 2 sinθ cosθ = (sin²θ)/2

Multiply both sides by 2:

4 sinθ cosθ = sin²θ

Bring everything to one side:

4 sinθ cosθ - sin²θ = 0

Factor:

sinθ (4 cosθ - sinθ) = 0

So either sinθ=0 (θ=0°, trivial) or 4 cosθ = sinθ → tanθ=4, so θ= arctan(4), which is option A.

Wait, but let me think again. Did I make a mistake in setting R=H?

Wait, because sometimes when dealing with range and maximum height, the expressions might involve different terms, but in this case, I think I used the correct ones.

Wait, wait. Let me just double-check the range formula. The standard range formula for a projectile launched from ground level is R = (v² sin 2θ)/g. And maximum height is H = (v² sin²θ)/(2g). So yes, that seems correct.

So plugging those into R=H, we get the equation that leads to tanθ=4, so θ= arctan(4), which is option A.

So looking at the options:

A: tan⁻¹4 → correct.

B: 60°, which is tan⁻¹(√3) ≈ 1.732, so no.

H: cos⁻¹4 → but cosine inverse is only defined between -1 and 1, and 4 is outside that range, so that's impossible. So H is invalid.

Same with E: sin⁻¹4 → also invalid because sine can't be more than 1.

So the only valid option that matches our result is A: tan⁻¹4.

To determine the angle θ at which an ideal projectile should be launched so that its horizontal displacement (range) is equal to its maximum vertical displacement (maximum height), we start by equating the expressions for range \( R \) and maximum height \( H \).

The range of a projectile is given by:

\[
R = \frac{v^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g}
\]

The maximum height is given by:

\[
H = \frac{v^2 \sin^2(\theta)}{2g}
\]

Setting \( R = H \), we have:

\[
\frac{v^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g} = \frac{v^2 \sin^2(\theta)}{2g}
\]

Simplifying by canceling \( v^2/g \) from both sides:

\[
\sin(2\theta) = \frac{\sin^2(\theta)}{2}
\]

Using the double-angle identity \( \sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta) \), the equation becomes:

\[
2 \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta) = \frac{\sin^2(\theta)}{2}
\]

Multiplying through by 2:

\[
4 \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta) = \sin^2(\theta)
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
4 \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta) - \sin^2(\theta) = 0
\]

Factoring out \( \sin(\theta) \):

\[
\sin(\theta) (4 \cos(\theta) - \sin(\theta)) = 0
\]

This gives two possibilities:

1. \( \sin(\theta) = 0 \), which implies \( \theta = 0^\circ \) (a trivial solution where the projectile does not leave the ground).
2. \( 4 \cos(\theta) - \sin(\theta) = 0 \), which simplifies to \( \tan(\theta) = 4 \).

Thus, \( \theta = \tan^{-1}(4) \). Calculating \( \tan^{-1}(4) \) gives an angle slightly greater than 75°, but the exact value is not required since the question asks for the form of the answer.

Now, analyzing the options:

- **A: \( \tan^{-1}(4) \)** — This matches the derived result.
- **B: \( 60^\circ \)** — Incorrect, as \( \tan(60^\circ) = \sqrt{3} \), not 4.
- **C: \( \cos^{-1}(1/g) \)** — Invalid, as \( 1/g \) is not dimensionless, and \( \cos^{-1} \) requires an argument between -1 and 1.
- **D: \( 45^\circ \)** — Incorrect, as \( \tan(45^\circ) = 1 \), not 4.
- **E: \( \sin^{-1}(4) \)** — Invalid, as \( \sin^{-1} \) requires an argument between -1 and 1.
- **F: \( 90^\circ \)** — Incorrect, as \( \tan(90^\circ) \) is undefined.
- **G: \( \tan^{-1}(1/g) \)** — Incorrect, as \( 1/g \) is not relevant to the solution.
- **H: \( \cos^{-1}(4) \)** — Invalid, as \( \cos^{-1} \) requires an argument between -1 and 1.
- **I: \( \sin^{-1}(1/g) \)** — Invalid, as \( \sin^{-1} \) requires an argument between -1 and 1.
- **J: \( 30^\circ \)** — Incorrect, as \( \tan(30^\circ) = \sqrt{3}/3 \), not 4.

The correct answer is **A: \( \tan^{-1}(4) \)**.
