Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about Hume's attack on natural law. I'm a bit rusty on my philosophy, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that David Hume was a Scottish philosopher known for his empiricist approach. He's famous for his skepticism, especially regarding metaphysics and things beyond what we can observe. So, his arguments often relate to observation and evidence.

Natural law theory, as I understand it, posits that there's a moral law inherent in nature, discoverable through reason, and applicable to all humans. Thinkers like Aquinas and Locke have written about it. Natural law is supposed to be universal and unchanging.

Hume's critique likely challenges this idea. I recall something about Hume's is-ought problem, which states that you can't derive an 'ought' (a moral statement) from an 'is' (a factual statement). So, just because something is a certain way doesn't mean it ought to be that way. If natural law is based on observations of human nature or the world, Hume might argue that it's a mistake to derive moral principles from such observations.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: No universal agreement on natural law. I'm not sure if Hume's main point was about agreement. He might have thought people agree, but his issue was more about the basis of that agreement.

Option B: Natural law is arbitrary. Maybe, but I think it's more about the lack of empirical basis.

Option C: Doesn't apply to all cultures. Hume did discuss cultural variations in morality, but I'm not sure if that's his main attack on natural law itself.

Option D: Backward-looking. Not sure what that means here. Maybe referring to tradition, but I don't recall Hume focusing on that.

Option E: No social contract. That's more related to his views on political obligation. Hume did critique the idea of an explicit social contract, but is that his attack on natural law? Maybe not directly.

Option F: Can't objectively know right or wrong. Hume was a moral skeptic, but natural law is supposed to be knowable. So maybe, but I think his point was more about deriving it from nature.

Option G: Outdated concept. Doesn't seem like Hume's style; more a modern critique.

Option H: Not based on empirical evidence. This rings a bell. Hume emphasized empiricism, so if natural law isn't derived from observation, he'd attack it. Natural law is often seen as a priori, so Hume might argue it's not based on evidence.

Option I: Fails to protect the state. Doesn't sound like Hume's concern. He was more into ethics and epistemology.

Option J: Doesn't consider individual rights. Not sure, but I don't think that's his main point against natural law.

So, putting it together: Hume's empiricist approach would lead him to argue that natural law isn't based on empirical evidence. Therefore, option H seems correct.

Hume's attack on natural law is rooted in his empiricist philosophy, which emphasizes that knowledge must come from observation and experience. Natural law, often considered a universal and a priori concept, does not align with this empirical approach. Hume would argue that natural law lacks an evidence-based foundation, making it unsuitable as a moral framework. Among the options provided, the one that best captures this critique is:

H: Natural law is not based on empirical evidence.

Answer: H
