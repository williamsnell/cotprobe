Okay, let's try to figure out this channel capacity problem. So, the question is about an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel, which I remember is a common model in information theory. The setup is that the output Y is equal to X plus Z, where Z is a Gaussian noise with mean 0 and variance 1. Also, Z is independent of X. The expected output power is constrained such that E[Y]^2 is less than or equal to 2. We need to find the channel capacity in bits.

Hmm, wait, I think the expected output power is usually E[Y²], not (E[Y])². Because power is the expectation of the square of the signal. So maybe that's a typo in the question. Oh, but the question says E(Y)^2 ≤ 2. That would be the square of the expected value, not the expectation of the square. That's a bit tricky because usually, the power is the expectation of the square. Let me think about this.

Wait, maybe the question is correct, and it's E[Y]^2 ≤ 2. But then, since Y = X + Z, E[Y] would be E[X] + E[Z]. Since Z is N(0,1), E[Z] is 0. So E[Y] is E[X]. So E[Y]^2 is (E[X])² ≤ 2. So the mean of X squared is at most 2. But wait, X is the input, so perhaps we have a mean constraint on X?

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because in AWGN channels, the capacity is usually calculated with a power constraint on X. Like E[X²] ≤ P. But in this case, the constraint is on E[Y]^2, which is (E[X])^2 ≤ 2. So the mean of X is bounded by sqrt(2) in absolute value.

But wait, the capacity of an AWGN channel is given by (1/2) log(1 + SNR), where SNR is the signal-to-noise ratio. But the SNR here would be (E[X²])/(variance of Z). Oh wait, no. Because here, the output power is constrained. Wait, maybe I'm mixing input and output. Let me think again.

Y = X + Z, and Z has variance 1, so the noise power is 1. The output power would be E[Y²] = E[(X + Z)^2] = E[X²] + 2 E[X]E[Z] + E[Z²]. Since E[Z] is zero (because it's N(0,1)), this simplifies to E[X²] + 1. So the output power is E[X²] + 1.

But the problem states that E(Y)^2 ≤ 2. Wait, that's (E[Y])² ≤ 2, not E[Y²] ≤ 2. So that's different. So E[Y] is E[X] because E[Z] is zero. So (E[X])² ≤ 2. So E[X] can be at most sqrt(2) or as low as -sqrt(2).

But for the channel capacity, I think we need to consider the average power of X, which is E[X²], not the square of the mean. Because when calculating SNR, it's the signal power over the noise power. So the SNR here would be E[X²]/1, assuming that E[X²] is the signal power.

But wait, the constraint given is on the mean of Y, not on the power of X. So in this case, the input X must have E[X]^2 ≤ 2. So E[X] can be up to sqrt(2), but that doesn't directly constrain E[X²], which is the variance plus the square of the mean.

Wait a minute, X is a random variable. So Var(X) = E[X²] - (E[X])². So E[X²] = Var(X) + (E[X])². Since (E[X])² is at most 2, E[X²] is at least something, but I'm not sure if that's the right approach.

Wait, but in the AWGN channel, the capacity is achieved when the input X is Gaussian with mean zero. Because any non-zero mean would result in a higher E[X²] for the same E[X], but maybe that's not the case here. Wait, if the constraint is on (E[X])², then perhaps the optimal X has a mean of zero. Because if you have a non-zero mean, you're using some of your "power" on the mean, which might not be efficient.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to have a mean of zero to maximize the variance, thus maximizing E[X²], because the more power you have, the higher the SNR, leading to higher capacity.

Wait, but the constraint is (E[X])^2 ≤ 2, so if E[X] is zero, then that condition is satisfied, and E[X²] can be as large as possible. Wait, no, because if E[X] is zero, then E[X²] is just the variance. But without a constraint on E[X²], then the variance could be anything. But that can't be right. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the constraint.

Wait, let me re-read the question. It says, "expected output power constraint P=2". Oh, wait, maybe I misread that. It says P=2, which probably refers to the output power, E[Y²] ≤ 2. Because in the AWGN channel, the output power is often the constraint. So perhaps the question meant E[Y²] ≤ 2, but the wording was E(Y)^2. Hmm, that would make more sense.

Because if the output power is E[Y²] = E[X²] + 1 ≤ 2, then E[X²] ≤ 1. So the input power is constrained to 1.

If that's the case, then the SNR would be E[X²]/E[Z²] = 1/1 = 1. So the channel capacity would be (1/2) log(1 + 1) = (1/2) log(2) ≈ 0.5 bits per channel use.

Wait, but the options include 0.5 as option F, but let me check the options again. Yes, option F is 0.5.

But wait, the question says E(Y)^2 ≤ 2. So if that's (E[Y])^2 ≤ 2, then E[X]^2 ≤ 2, as E[Y] = E[X]. So that's different.

So if E[X]^2 ≤ 2, then the mean of X can be up to sqrt(2). But how does that affect the capacity?

Wait, in the AWGN channel, the capacity is achieved when the input X is Gaussian with zero mean. Because a non-zero mean could be used to send information, but it's not efficient in terms of power.

Alternatively, maybe the input distribution is Gaussian with some mean μ, and variance σ². Then, the output Y would have mean μ and variance σ² + 1.

But the constraint is E[Y]^2 = μ² ≤ 2, so μ can be up to sqrt(2). So the maximum μ is sqrt(2), but would that be the optimal for capacity?

Wait, capacity is about mutual information, so perhaps a non-zero mean could allow a higher rate. Or maybe not, because mutual information depends on the distribution and how much Y can vary.

Wait, mutual information I(X;Y) is given by h(Y) - h(Y|X). For the AWGN channel, when X is Gaussian with mean μ and variance σ², and Y = X + Z with Z ~ N(0,1), then Y is also Gaussian with mean μ and variance σ² + 1.

So h(Y) is (1/2) log(2πe(σ² + 1)).

h(Y|X) is the conditional entropy, which for AWGN is h(Z) = (1/2) log(2πe(1)).

So the mutual information is (1/2) log((σ² + 1)/(1)) ) = (1/2) log(1 + σ²).

Wait, but what about the mean μ? It seems that the mutual information doesn't depend on μ because the variance is what's important. Because when you have Y = X + Z, and X has mean μ, the distribution of Y is just shifted by μ, but the variance remains the same. So when you compute h(Y), it's (1/2) log(2πe(σ² + 1)), which is the same regardless of μ. Similarly, h(Y|X) is the same because the noise is additive and independent.

So in that case, the mutual information I(X;Y) is (1/2) log(1 + σ²), which depends only on the variance of X, not the mean.

So to maximize the mutual information, we want to maximize σ², the variance of X. But what's the constraint on σ²?

From the constraint, we have E[Y]^2 = μ² ≤ 2. So μ can be at most sqrt(2) in absolute value. But how does that relate to σ²?

We know that E[X] = μ, and Var(X) = E[X²] - (E[X])² = σ². So E[X²] = σ² + μ².

Wait, but without a constraint on E[X²], the variance can be as large as possible, which would make the mutual information as large as possible. But that can't be right because channel capacity would be unbounded otherwise, which isn't the case.

Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption. Because the problem states that the expected output power is constrained. Oh wait, earlier I thought it might be E[Y²] ≤ 2, but the question says E(Y)^2 ≤ 2.

So if the constraint is E[Y]^2 = μ² ≤ 2, then the maximum μ is sqrt(2). But without a constraint on the variance of X, the channel capacity would be unbounded as σ² can be increased indefinitely, leading to higher mutual information. But that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the constraint is on E[Y²], but the question says E(Y)^2. Let me re-examine the question.

The question says: "expected output power constraint P=2. Thus Y = X + Z, Z ~ N(0, 1), Z is independent of X, and E(Y)^2 ≤ 2."

Wait, that's confusing. The "expected output power" should be E[Y²], not (E[Y])². So perhaps it's a typo in the question. Because the expected output power is E[Y²], which would make sense as a constraint. But the way it's written is E(Y)^2.

So if I proceed under the assumption that the intended constraint is E[Y²] ≤ 2, then the solution would be as I thought earlier. Let me see.

If E[Y²] = E[X² + 2XZ + Z²] = E[X²] + 2E[X]E[Z] + E[Z²] = E[X²] + 0 + 1 = E[X²] + 1 ≤ 2.

So E[X²] ≤ 1.

Then, the SNR is E[X²]/E[Z²] = 1/1 = 1.

So the capacity is (1/2) log(1 + 1) = 0.5 bits per channel use. So the answer would be F: 0.5.

But wait, if the constraint is E(Y)^2 ≤ 2, which is (E[Y])² ≤ 2, then E[X]^2 ≤ 2, so E[X] can be up to sqrt(2). But then, what about the variance of X?

In that case, the variance of X is E[X²] - (E[X])². So E[X²] = Var(X) + (E[X])².

But without any constraint on E[X²], the variance can be as large as possible, making the channel capacity unbounded, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps that's not the correct interpretation.

Alternatively, maybe the intended constraint is on E[Y²], and the question has a typo. So I think the correct approach is to assume that E[Y²] ≤ 2, leading to E[X²] ≤ 1, and thus channel capacity of 0.5 bits.

Looking back at the options, F is 0.5. So the answer should be F.

The problem involves an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel where the output is given by \( Y = X + Z \), with \( Z \sim N(0, 1) \) being independent of \( X \). The constraint is \( E(Y)^2 \leq 2 \), and the goal is to determine the channel capacity in bits.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Understanding the Constraint**:  
   The phrase "expected output power" typically refers to \( E[Y^2] \), which is the average power of the output signal. However, the problem explicitly states \( E(Y)^2 \leq 2 \), which is the square of the expected value of \( Y \). Since \( Y = X + Z \) and \( E[Z] = 0 \), this simplifies to \( (E[X])^2 \leq 2 \). Thus, \( E[X] \) is constrained to \( |E[X]| \leq \sqrt{2} \).

2. **Channel Capacity of AWGN**:  
   The capacity of an AWGN channel is generally given by:
   \[
   C = \frac{1}{2} \log(1 + \text{SNR}),
   \]
   where \( \text{SNR} = \frac{E[X^2]}{E[Z^2]} \). Here, \( E[Z^2] = 1 \), so \( \text{SNR} = E[X^2] \).

3. **Interpreting the Constraint**:  
   If the constraint were \( E[Y^2] \leq 2 \), it would imply \( E[X^2] + 1 \leq 2 \), leading to \( E[X^2] \leq 1 \). In this case, the SNR would be \( 1 \), and the channel capacity would be:
   \[
   C = \frac{1}{2} \log(1 + 1) = \frac{1}{2} \log(2) = 0.5 \, \text{bits}.
   \]

4. **Resolution of Ambiguity**:  
   The problem explicitly states \( E(Y)^2 \leq 2 \), which constrains \( E[X] \) rather than \( E[X^2] \). However, without a direct constraint on \( E[X^2] \), the variance of \( X \) (and thus the SNR) could theoretically be unbounded, leading to an unbounded channel capacity. This interpretation does not align with the practical context of the problem. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume the intended constraint was \( E[Y^2] \leq 2 \), which leads to a well-defined solution.

5. **Final Answer**:  
   Assuming \( E[Y^2] \leq 2 \), the channel capacity is \( 0.5 \, \text{bits} \), corresponding to option **F**.

### Conclusion:
The channel capacity of the AWGN channel under the given constraints is \( 0.5 \, \text{bits} \).
