Okay, so I have this economics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let me try to understand what's being asked. The question is about calculating the total of withdrawals from the economic income-expenditure circuit. Hmm, I remember that in economics, the circular flow model shows how money circulates between households and businesses. Withdrawals are the leaks from this circuit, like savings, taxes, and imports. But wait, the question gives me the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) and the income tax rate, so I think it's focusing on personal taxes and savings as the main withdrawals here.

The MPC is 0.90, which means that out of every additional dollar people receive, they spend 90 cents and save 10 cents. So the marginal propensity to save (MPS) would be 1 - MPC, which is 0.10. But wait, no, because MPS is the fraction saved, which is 0.10 here. But then there's also the income tax rate, which is 0.26. So taxes are another withdrawal.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. So total withdrawals would be the sum of taxes and savings. But how do I calculate each of these?

Let me think. For a given level of income (which I think is the total output given here), the total consumption can be calculated if I know the MPC. But wait, actually, the MPC is the fraction of additional income spent. But for total consumption, I think the formula is C = C0 + MPC*(Y - T), where C0 is autonomous consumption and T is taxes. But wait, no, because I'm trying to find withdrawals, which include taxes and savings.

Alternatively, maybe I should approach it differently. Withdrawals would be equal to savings plus taxes. Savings are calculated as MPS times income after taxes, I think. Because people save out of their disposable income. Or is it before taxes? Wait, no, taxes are deducted first. So disposable income is Y*(1 - tax rate), and savings would be MPS times that disposable income.

Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up concepts. Let me clarify: The income-expenditure model. In equilibrium, Y = C + I + G + (X - M), but that's more about aggregate demand. But for the withdrawals, I think it's about the factors that take money out of the circular flow. So, for each household, their income (Y) is spent on consumption (C), taxed as T, and saved (S). So Y = C + S + T. Therefore, withdrawals S + T would be Y - C.

But I'm given MPC and the tax rate. So maybe I can express C in terms of Y. Let's think about the consumption function. The consumption function is usually written as C = C0 + MPC*(Y - T), where Y is disposable income. But wait, no, sometimes it's written as C = MPC*(Y - T) + C0, which is the same thing. But without knowing C0, how can I proceed? Because the question doesn't give me any information about autonomous consumption.

Wait, perhaps the question is assuming that C0 is zero, or that we're looking at induced consumption only. But that's a big assumption. Alternatively, maybe we can model it differently.

Wait, the question is about the total withdrawals, which are savings plus taxes. So W = S + T.

Savings (S) is equal to Y - C - T. Because Y = C + S + T. So S = Y - C - T.

But I can also express C in terms of Y and T. The MPC is the fraction of disposable income that's consumed. Disposable income is Y - T. So C = MPC*(Y - T). So substituting that into the savings equation:

S = Y - [MPC*(Y - T)] - T.

Let me expand that: S = Y - MPC*(Y - T) - T.

But the tax is T, which is a function of income. The tax rate is given as 0.26, so T = 0.26*Y. Because it's an income tax.

So substituting T = 0.26 Y into the equation:

S = Y - MPC*(Y - 0.26Y) - 0.26Y.

Simplify within the brackets: Y - 0.26Y is 0.74Y.

So S = Y - MPC*(0.74 Y) - 0.26 Y.

Now, MPC is 0.90, so substituting:

S = Y - 0.90*(0.74 Y) - 0.26 Y.

Let me calculate 0.90 * 0.74. 0.9 * 0.74 = 0.666.

So S = Y - 0.666 Y - 0.26 Y.

Combine like terms: Y (1 - 0.666 - 0.26) = Y*(1 - 0.926) = Y*(0.074). So S = 0.074 Y.

Wait, that can't be right. Because 0.9*(0.74) is 0.666, then 0.666+0.26 is 0.926. So 1 - 0.926 is 0.074.

So S = 0.074 Y.

Now, the total withdrawals W are S + T. T is 0.26 Y, and S is 0.074 Y.

So W = 0.26 Y + 0.074 Y = 0.334 Y.

Oh, so the total withdrawal is 0.334 times the total output (Y). So for each level of Y given, I can compute W as 0.334 * Y.

Let me check the given Y values: 1,100; 1,050; 1,000; 950; 900 billion.

Wait the question says to calculate the total of withdrawals for each of these levels, but looking at the options, each option is a single value. Hmm, perhaps the question is to find W for each Y, but the options only give a single answer, so maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Alternatively, perhaps the question is why this calculation is important, but the main task is to compute W.

Wait, the actual question is: Calculate the total of withdrawals from the economic income-expenditure circuit, when given MPC and tax rate, for the following levels of Y. But the options are single values. Maybe the question is to find the total for each of these Y values, but the options are multiple, but the way the question is phrased, perhaps it's to calculate for each Y, but the options are just the possible values for one of them. Alternatively, perhaps it's asking for the total of all these withdrawals across all Y levels, but that doesn't make much sense.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me reread the question. It says, calculate the total of withdrawals when given MPC is 0.90 and tax rate 0.26 for the following levels of Y: 1100, 1050, etc. Then it asks why this is important.

But the options are single values, each in billions. So perhaps I'm supposed to compute W for each Y, but then the options don't list multiple answers. Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: maybe the question is to find W for each Y, and the options are possible values for each. But since the question is asking for the total of withdrawals, and each Y would give a different W, perhaps the question is to compute W for each Y, but the answer options are single values, so perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is to calculate the total withdrawals across all the given Y levels. But that would sum them all up, but that's not standard. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the total in general, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in computing W as 0.334 Y. Let me double-check the steps.

We have W = S + T.

S is savings, which is Y - C - T.

C is consumption, which is MPC*(Y - T).

So C = 0.90*(Y - T).

And T is 0.26 Y.

So substituting T into C:

C = 0.90*(Y - 0.26 Y) = 0.90*(0.74 Y) = 0.666 Y.

So C = 0.666 Y.

Then S = Y - C - T = Y - 0.666 Y - 0.26 Y = Y*(1 - 0.666 - 0.26) = Y*(0.074), as before.

So W = S + T = 0.074 Y + 0.26 Y = 0.334 Y.

So W = 0.334 Y.

So for each Y, W is 33.4% of Y.

Looking at the options, let's compute 0.334 times each Y and see which option matches.

Compute for each Y:

1,100 billion * 0.334 = ?

Let me calculate: 1,100 * 0.334.

1,000 * 0.334 = 334.

100 * 0.334 = 33.4.

So 334 + 33.4 = 367.4.

But that's not one of the options. Wait, looking at the options, option H is 334.0. Option D is 362.1. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me check the calculations again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the W formula. Let me go back.

Wait, another approach: The withdrawal W is equal to S + T.

But S is the savings, which is (1 - MPC) * (Y - T), because savings are a fraction of disposable income.

So S = MPS * (Y - T) = 0.10 * (Y - 0.26 Y) = 0.10 * 0.74 Y = 0.074 Y.

T is 0.26 Y.

So W = 0.074 Y + 0.26 Y = 0.334 Y.

So for Y = 1,100: 1,100 * 0.334 = 367.4 billion.

But none of the options match that. Wait, let me look at the options again.

Options are:

A: 320.4

B:317.3

C:405

D:362.1

E:246

F:289.5

G:300.6

H:334

I:275.8

J:350.7

Hmm, so 367.4 isn't present. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe I'm supposed to compute the total withdrawals for each Y and then sum them all, but that seems unlikely. Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait the question says, "the total of withdrawals from the economic income-expenditure circuit, when it is given that... for the following levels of total output." So maybe the question is asking for the total withdrawal across all these Y levels. But that would require adding up 0.334 * each Y and summing them. But the options are single values, so that can't be.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is to calculate W for each Y, but the options only give one value, so perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check the MPC and tax rate.

MPC is 0.90, tax rate is 0.26.

So T = 0.26 Y.

Disposable income is Y - T = Y (1 - 0.26) = 0.74 Y.

Consumption C is MPC * disposable income = 0.90 * 0.74 Y = 0.666 Y.

Savings S is disposable income - consumption, which is 0.74 Y - 0.666 Y = 0.074 Y.

So W = T + S = 0.26 Y + 0.074 Y = 0.334 Y.

So W = 0.334 Y.

Wait, maybe the question is asking for the total of all possible withdrawals across all Y levels. Let's sum 0.334 * each Y:

Y values: 1100, 1050, 1000, 950, 900.

Sum of Y's:

1100 + 1050 = 2150

+1000 = 3150

+950 = 4100

+900 = 5000.

So sum of Y is 5000 billion.

Then W_total = 0.334 * 5000 = 1,670 billion. But none of the options are close to this, so that can't be it.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the average of the withdrawals for each Y. Let's compute W for each Y and then average them.

Compute W for each Y:

Y=1,100: 0.334 * 1100 = 367.4

Y=1,050: 0.334 * 1050 = 350.7

Y=1,000: 0.334 * 1000 = 334.0

Y=950: 0.334 * 950 = 317.3

Y=900: 0.334 * 900 = 300.6

Looking at the options, I see that option H is 334.0, which is the W when Y is 1,000 billion. Option J is 350.7, which is when Y is 1,050. Option B is 317.3 (Y=950), and option G is 300.6 (Y=900).

But the question is why is this calculation important. Hmm. Maybe the question is to calculate W at equilibrium or something else, but I'm getting stuck.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the concept of withdrawals. Let me think again. Withdrawals from the circular flow include savings, taxes, and imports. But in this problem, perhaps we're only considering savings and taxes as withdrawals, assuming imports are zero or not considered. So W = S + T.

But I've already calculated that W = 0.334 Y. So for each Y, W is 0.334 times Y.

Looking back at the options, the only matching number is when Y is 1,000 billion: 334.0, which is option H.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the total of all withdrawals across all Y levels. But that's 367.4 + 350.7 + 334.0 + 317.3 + 300.6 = let's add them:

367.4 + 350.7 = 718.1

718.1 + 334 = 1052.1

1052.1 + 317.3 = 1369.4

1369.4 + 300.6 = 1670. So 1,670 billion, which isn't an option.

Wait, perhaps the question is only asking for one Y value, like the middle one (1,000), giving W=334.0, which is option H.

But why then the question lists multiple Y levels? Unless it's a trick question where the calculation is the same for each, but no, each Y gives a different W.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the total withdrawals when Y is at a certain level, but the options don't match the calculation I did for Y=1,100. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me try recalculating W for Y=1,100.

0.334 * 1100 = ?

Well, 0.3 * 1100 = 330.

0.034 * 1100 = 37.4.

So 330 + 37.4 = 367.4, which is not an option. So perhaps the approach is wrong.

Wait, perhaps another approach is needed. Maybe the question is asking about the government's withdrawals, which would be taxes, or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for total withdrawals as (1 - MPC) * Y + MPC * T, but I'm not sure.

Wait another approach: The total withdrawals are equal to the sum of savings and taxes. Savings can be calculated as (1 - MPC) * (Y - T), and taxes as T.

So W = (1 - MPC)*(Y - T) + T.

But T is 0.26 Y.

So substituting:

W = (0.10) * (Y - 0.26 Y) + 0.26 Y.

Y - 0.26 Y is 0.74 Y.

So W = 0.10 * 0.74 Y + 0.26 Y.

Which is 0.074 Y + 0.26 Y = 0.334 Y, same as before.

So same result. So perhaps the answer is 0.334 times each Y, but the options don't include 367.4, which would be for Y=1,100.

Wait, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate something else. Maybe the total withdrawals across all Y levels, but that gives 1,670, which isn't an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is actually asking for the total injection, which would be equal to withdrawals, but that's a different concept.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the balanced budget level, but that's when T = G, but the question doesn't mention government spending.

Wait, perhaps the question is about why this calculation is important. The answer would relate to understanding the leakages from the circular flow, which affect aggregate demand and thus equilibrium income. But the question is asking for the total withdrawals, which is the main calculation.

But the options are specific values, so perhaps I'm missing something. Let's recheck the math.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating 0.334 * 1,100. Let me compute it more accurately.

0.334 * 1,100.

0.3 * 1,100 = 330.

0.03 * 1,100 = 33.

0.004 * 1,100 = 4.4.

So 330 + 33 = 363 + 4.4 = 367.4. Correct.

But none of the options match that. Looking at the options, option D is 362.1, which is close. But why is that?

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the W formula. Let me try another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the tax is a fixed amount, not a percentage. But the question says the income tax rate is 0.26, so it's a percentage.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Let me think again.

Total withdrawals W = S + T.

S is savings, which is (Y - T - C).

C is consumption, which is MPC*(Y - T).

So C = 0.9*(Y - T).

But T is 0.26 Y.

So C = 0.9*(Y - 0.26 Y) = 0.9*(0.74 Y) = 0.666 Y.

Thus, S = Y - T - C = Y - 0.26 Y - 0.666
