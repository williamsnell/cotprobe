Question:

A well-known Washington newspaper columnist was researching the background of a lawyer who had been nominated to become attorney general of the United States and was awaiting confirmation by the U. S. Senate. One of the columnist's eager young apprentices concocted a plan that he hoped would enable him to gain the columnist's favor. Late one evening, without telling anyone, the apprentice broke into the lawyer's private office and copied several letters pertaining to "dirty tricks" perpetrated by the lawyer during the most recent presidential campaign. When the apprentice presented the columnist with the fruits of his diligent research, the columnist was quite impressed and immediately printed excerpts from the material. If the lawyer asserts a claim against the columnist for invasion of right to privacy, the plaintiff will most likely

Options:

A: prevail, because the information was obtained illegally.
B: prevail, because the publication was not newsworthy.
C: prevail, because the apprentice's action was an unlawful invasion of private facts.
D: prevail, because the apprentice acted on behalf of the columnist, making him liable.
E: not prevail, because the apprentice acted independently and without the knowledge or direction of the columnist.
F: not prevail, because the columnist was not involved in the burglary and did not conspire with the apprentice with respect to the burglary.
G: not prevail, because the information was of public interest and its publication served a greater public good.
H: not prevail, because the lawyer was a public figure and therefore his actions are subject to public scrutiny.
I: prevail, because the publication of private letters is an infringement on personal rights.
J: not prevail, because what the columnist printed was true, thus establishing there was no "false light. "

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about privacy law and whether a columnist can be held liable for invasion of privacy. Let me try to break this down step by step.

Alright, the scenario is about a Washington newspaper columnist who's researching a lawyer nominated for attorney general. An apprentice of the columnist breaks into the lawyer's office, copies some letters about "dirty tricks" during the presidential campaign, and gives them to the columnist. The columnist then publishes excerpts. Now, the lawyer is suing the columnist for invasion of privacy. The question is whether the lawyer will prevail.

First, I need to remember what invasion of privacy entails. I think invasion of privacy can take a few forms, like intrusion upon seclusion, public disclosure of a private fact, or false light publicity. But in this case, the issue seems to be about how the information was obtained and whether the publication is protected.

The apprentice broke into the office, which is illegal. But the columnist wasn't involved in the burglary. So, the question is about whether the columnist can be held liable for using information obtained illegally by someone else.

I remember something about the Supreme Court case called New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, which deals with defamation and public officials. But I'm not sure if that applies here. Wait, maybe it's more about the Privacy Protection Act or the First Amendment protections for the press.

Another case that comes to mind is Bartnicki v. Vopper. In that case, a radio host aired a taped conversation that was illegally recorded by someone else. The Supreme Court ruled that the radio host wasn't liable because the information was of public concern and they didn't participate in the illegal recording. So, the First Amendment protected them.

So, applying that here, the columnist didn't break into the office. The apprentice did it without the columnist's knowledge. The information was about the lawyer's involvement in dirty tricks in a presidential campaign, which seems like it's of public interest, especially since the lawyer is nominated for a high public office like attorney general.

Therefore, the columnist's publication would likely be protected under the First Amendment because the information is newsworthy and of public concern, even though it was obtained illegally by a third party without the columnist's involvement.

Looking at the options, option G says the lawyer won't prevail because the info was of public interest and served a greater good. Option H says the lawyer is a public figure, so his actions are scrutinized. Option F says the columnist didn't conspire or was involved in the burglary. Option E says the apprentice acted independently.

But the key point is that the information's newsworthiness and public interest protect the columnist, even if the info was obtained illegally by someone else. So, the correct answer should be G or H.

Wait, but public figures have a higher bar in defamation cases, but this is about privacy. For public figures, their private facts might be subject to scrutiny if they're relevant to their public role. So, if the lawyer is a public figure, his privacy might be more limited, especially regarding actions taken in a public campaign context.

So, maybe H is the right answer because the lawyer is a public figure, making his actions subject to public scrutiny. Alternatively, G focuses on public interest and greater good.

Wait, but H says the lawyer is a public figure, so his actions are subject to scrutiny. That would mean the columnist can publish without liability because the lawyer's privacy isn't as protected.

Alternatively, G says it's about public interest, which might apply even if the person isn't a public figure.

In this scenario, the lawyer is nominated for a high public office, so he's definitely a public figure. Therefore, H might be the reason the columnist isn't liable.

Wait, but the question is about invasion of privacy, not defamation. So, even for public figures, there's a privacy tort. But the First Amendment might still protect the publication if it's newsworthy.

In the case I mentioned, Bartnicki v. Vopper, the court held that the press could publish information of public concern obtained from an illegal source, as long as they weren't involved in the illegality.

So, the key factors here are:

1. The information is of public concern (dirty tricks in a campaign, lawyer nominated for AG).
2. The columnist didn't participate in the illegal act (the break-in).
3. Therefore, the First Amendment protects the publication.

So, looking at the options:

Option G: Not prevail because the info was of public interest and served a greater public good. This aligns with Bartnicki.

Option H: Not prevail because the lawyer is a public figure. That's another angle, but I think the stronger reasoning is the public interest in the information.

Option F: Not prevail because the columnist wasn't involved in the burglary. That's also a point, but the key is the First Amendment protection regardless of the source, as long as the info is newsworthy.

So, the best answer is probably G, but H is also a possibility.

Wait, but the question is about invasion of privacy, specifically. The public figure status affects defamation, but for privacy, it's about whether the matter is of public concern and whether it's a private fact that's non-newsworthy.

So, if the information is about the lawyer's role in dirty tricks during the campaign and he's up for a public office, that's highly newsworthy. Therefore, the columnist's publication is protected.

So, the correct answer would be G: not prevail because the information was of public interest and served a greater public good.

The scenario involves a columnist who published excerpts from letters obtained by an apprentice who broke into a lawyer's office. The lawyer, nominated for attorney general, is suing for invasion of privacy. The key issue is whether the columnist can be held liable for publishing information obtained illegally by a third party.

Invasion of privacy can involve public disclosure of private facts, but the First Amendment protects the publication of information of public concern if the publisher was not involved in the illegal act. The Supreme Court case *Bartnicki v. Vopper* established that the press can publish such information if it is newsworthy and the publisher did not participate in the illegality.

Here, the information pertains to "dirty tricks" in a presidential campaign, which is of significant public interest, especially since the lawyer is a public figure nominated for a high office. The columnist did not participate in the break-in, and the publication serves a greater public good by informing the public about the lawyer's actions. Therefore, the First Amendment protects the columnist.

Option G correctly reflects this reasoning, as the information's public interest and the greater public good outweigh the privacy concerns. Other options, such as H, focus on the lawyer's public figure status, but the stronger basis for the columnist's protection is the newsworthiness and public interest in the information.

**Answer:** G
