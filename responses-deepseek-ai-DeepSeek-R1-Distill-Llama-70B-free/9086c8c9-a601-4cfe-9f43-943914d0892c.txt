Question:

A gas main carrying natural gas and laid in a corrosive soil ultimately reaches the point where it develops small leaks that increase as time goes on. Assume the cost per mile of main is $8,000, that no gas is lost for the first 15 years of life, and that a main has zero net salvage value whenever retired. Assume also that the mile of main loses $60 worth of gas in the 16th year of life and that the cost of lost gas increases $60 every year thereafter. Interest or minimum attractive return is at 7%. Compare the equivalent uniform annual cost over the life of a main retired after 20 years with the equivalent uniform annual cost over the life of the main retired after 25 years.

Options:

A: The total annual cost of the 25-year line is substantially lower than that of the 20-year line due to reduced leak repair costs
B: The total annual cost of the 20-year line is equal to that of the 25-year line when including the cost of gas loss
C: The total annual cost of the 25-year line is equal to that of the 20-year line
D: The total annual cost of the 20-year line is lower than that of the 25-year line when factoring in technological improvements in leak detection
E: The total annual cost of the 20-year line is lower than that of the 25-year line
F: The total annual cost of the 25-year line is higher than that of the 20-year line due to higher cumulative gas loss
G: The total annual cost of the 25-year line is lower than that of the 20-year line
H: The total annual cost of the 20-year line is higher than that of the 25-year line due to increased maintenance costs
I: The total annual cost of the 25-year line is higher than that of the 20-year line
J: The total annual cost of the 25-year line is slightly higher than that of the 20-year line due to escalating gas prices

Okay, so I've got this problem here about gas mains and their costs over time. Hmm, let me try to break it down. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember something about equivalent uniform annual costs and present worth. 

So the question says that a gas main is laid in corrosive soil and starts leaking over time. The cost per mile is $8,000. For the first 15 years, no gas is lost. After that, starting in year 16, it loses $60 worth of gas, and this loss increases by $60 each subsequent year. The interest rate is 7%, and the main has zero salvage value when retired.

We need to compare the equivalent uniform annual costs for retiring the main after 20 years versus 25 years. So, I think I need to calculate the EUAC for both scenarios and then see which one is lower or higher.

Wait, EUAC stands for Equivalent Uniform Annual Cost. Right, it's the average annual cost when considering the time value of money. The formula for EUAC is usually the present worth multiplied by the capital recovery factor.

First, let's outline the cash flows. The initial cost is $8,000, which happens at time zero. Then, for years 1-15, no gas is lost, so no costs there. Starting year 16, the cost is $60, then $120 in year 17, $180 in year 18, and so on. So it's an arithmetic progression starting at year 16.

But wait, the retirement is either at 20 or 25 years. So for the 20-year scenario, the gas loss occurs from year 16 to 20. That's 5 years. For the 25-year scenario, it's from 16 to 25, which is 10 years.

I think I should calculate the present worth of the gas losses for each scenario and then add the initial cost. Then, convert that present worth into an EUAC.

Let me start with the 20-year case. The initial cost is $8,000. The gas loss starts in year 16. So the gas loss each year is:

Year 16: $60
Year 17: $120
Year 18: $180
Year 19: $240
Year 20: $300

Wait, wait, no, the loss increases by $60 each year after the 16th. So year 16 is 60, year 17 is 120, year 18 is 180, year 19 is 240, year 20 is 300. So for 5 years, that's an arithmetic series where the first term a1 is 60, common difference d is 60, number of terms n is 5.

The present worth of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula:

PW = A * (P/A, i, n) + (d * (P/G, i, n))

Wait, I think the formula for the present worth of an arithmetic gradient is:

PW = (A - A1) * (P/A, i, n) + A1 * (P/G, i, n)

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, I can model it as an ordinary annuity with an increasing payment. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to calculate each year's loss, bring them to present value, and sum them up. But that might take more time.

Alternatively, I can use the formula for the present worth of an arithmetic progression. The formula is:

PW = (A1 * (1 + i) * n - A1 - i * d) / (i^2) ) * (P/A, i, n) )

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again.

The series of gas losses is an arithmetic progression starting at year 16. So for the 20-year case, it's 5 terms starting at 60, increasing by 60 each year.

So the series is 60, 120, 180, 240, 300 in years 16 to 20.

To find the present worth, I need to discount each of these back to year 0.

Alternatively, I can find the present worth at year 15 and then discount it back 15 years.

Wait, maybe it's easier to model the entire series. Let me see.

The present worth of the gas losses for 20 years:

Each year's loss is 60*(n), where n starts at 1 in year 16.

Wait, year 16: 60*1, year 17:60*2,..., year 20:60*5.

So the total gas loss in present worth is the sum from t=16 to 20 of 60*(t-15) / (1+i)^(t).

Alternatively, I can factor this as 60 * sum from k=1 to 5 of k / (1+i)^(15 +k).

Hmm, that might be a bit tedious, but perhaps manageable.

Alternatively, I can use the formula for the present worth of an arithmetic series.

The formula for the present worth of an arithmetic series starting at period 1 (as opposed to starting later) is:

PW = A1 * (P/A, i, n) + d * (P/G, i, n)

Where:
A1 = first payment
d = common difference
n = number of periods.

But in this case, the series starts at period 16. So I need to adjust for the delay. So the present worth would be the present worth of the series starting at period 16, which is the same as the present worth at period 15 multiplied by (P/A, i, 15).

Wait, no. The series starts at period 16, so to discount it back to period 0, it's each term divided by (1+i)^t where t is 16,17,...,20.

Alternatively, I can calculate the present worth of the series as of period 15, then discount that back 15 years.

So, the series from period 16 to 20 is 5 terms. As of period 15, the series is 60, 120, 180, 240, 300.

Wait no, wait, in period 16, the loss is 60, which is one period after period 15. So as of period 15, the first term is 60/(1+i)^1, the next is 120/(1+i)^2, etc.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to calculate the present worth at period 15 and then multiply by (1+i)^(-15).

So, considering the series from period 16 to 20: 5 terms, first term A =60, common difference d=60, i=7% or 0.07.

The present worth at period 15 would be:

PW_15 = 60*(P/A,7%,5) + 60*(P/G,7%,5)

Wait, wait, no, the formula for the present worth of an arithmetic gradient starting with A1 and increasing by G each period is:

PW = A1*(P/A, i, n) + G*(P/G, i, n)

Wait, no, perhaps it's better to use the formula:

PW = (A1 + (A1 + (n-1)G)) * n / (2) * (1/(1+i)^n) ??? Hmm, no, that's the future value approach.

Alternatively, the present worth of an arithmetic series can be found using:

PW = (A1*(P/A, i, n)) + (G*(P/G, i, n))

Where A1 is the first term, G is the gradient, and n the number of terms.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact formula, perhaps I should just compute each term's present value and sum them.

So for the 20-year case, the gas losses occur in years 16-20.

Compute each loss, discount to present:

Year 16: 60 / (1.07)^16
Year 17: 120 / (1.07)^17
Year 18: 180 / (1.07)^18
Year 19: 240 / (1.07)^19
Year 20: 300 / (1.07)^20

Sum all these to get the present worth of gas losses for 20 years.

Similarly, for the 25-year case, the losses run from year 16 to 25, so 10 years. Each year's loss is 60*(year-15).

So for year 16:60, 17:120,...,25:60*(25-15)=600.

So compute each of these 10 terms, discount each, sum to get present worth.

Once I have the present worth of the gas losses, I add the initial cost ($8,000) to get the total present worth for each case.

Then, to get the EUAC, I multiply the total present worth by the capital recovery factor (CRF) for the respective period (20 or 25 years).

Wait, no. Wait, the EUAC is calculated as (PW) * (A/P, i, n), where n is the period. So for each case, n is 20 and 25 respectively.

Wait, no, the period is the life of the main. So when the main is retired after 20 years, the EUAC would be over 20 years, and same for 25.

So for each case:

PW_total = 8,000 + PW_gas_losses

EUAC = PW_total * (A/P, 7%, n)

Where n is 20 or 25.

I think that's the approach.

But calculating each term individually might take some time. Maybe I can find a formula to compute the sum more efficiently.

Alternatively, perhaps I can model the gas losses as a delayed arithmetic gradient.

The gas losses start at year 16, so they're delayed for 15 years. An arithmetic gradient starting at year 16 can be seen as a series with first term A1=60, gradient G=60, delayed for 15 years.

The present worth of such a series would be:

PW = (P/A, 7%,5) *60 + (P/G,7%,5)*60) * (P/A,7%,15)^{-1}

Wait, no, perhaps the present worth is (PW of the gradient series) multiplied by (1/(1+i)^15).

So, first compute the present worth of the 5-term (for 20 years) arithmetic gradient starting at year 16.

PW_5 = 60*(P/A,7%,5) + 60*(P/G,7%,5)

Then, discount this back 15 years: PW_total_gas = PW_5 * (1/(1.07)^15)

Wait, but wait, the (1/(1.07)^15) is the same as (P/F,7%,15). So yes, that's correct.

Similarly, for the 25-year case, the gradient series is 10 terms, starting at 60 with G=60.

So PW_10 = 60*(P/A,7%,10) + 60*(P/G,7%,10)

Then, discount this back 15 years: PW_total_gas_25 = PW_10 * (P/F,7%,15)

Once I have PW_total_gas for each case, add the initial $8,000 investment to get the total present worth.

Then, compute EUAC for 20 and 25 years.

Let me try to compute these step by step.

First, I'll need the (P/A), (P/G), and (P/F) factors for 7% interest.

I can look up these factors or compute them.

Compute for 20-year case:

n=5 years for the gradient,

Compute (P/A,7%,5):

P/A = [1 - (1+i)^-n ] / i = [1 - 1/(1.07)^5]/0.07

Similarly, (P/G,7%,5) is [1/(i) * [1 - (1+i)^-n ] - [1 - (1+i)^-n ]/i^2 ] Wait, perhaps better to compute using the formula:

(P/G, i, n) = [1/i^2] * [1 - (1+i)^-n (1 + i*n) ]

Wait, maybe it's easier to look up the standard factors.

Alternatively, compute them step by step.

Let me compute (P/A,7%,5):

(1.07)^5 ≈ 1.40255

So 1/(1.07)^5 ≈ 0.71378

[1 - 0.71378]/0.07 ≈ (0.28622)/0.07 ≈ 4.0889

So (P/A,7%,5) ≈ 4.0889

Similarly, (P/G,7%,5):

The formula is (P/G, i, n) = (1/i) [ (1 - (1+i)^-n ) - i * n * (1+i)^-n ) ]

Plugging in i=0.07, n=5:

(1/0.07) [ (1 - 0.71378) - 0.07 *5 * 0.71378 ]

= (1/0.07) [ 0.28622 - 0.07*5*0.71378 ]

Compute the second term: 0.07*5=0.35; 0.35*0.71378≈0.24982

So 0.28622 - 0.24982 ≈ 0.0364

Multiply by 1/0.07: 0.0364 /0.07 ≈ 0.5200

So (P/G,7%,5) ≈ 0.5200

So, PW_5 (gas losses for 20 years) is:

60 * 4.0889 + 60 * 0.5200

= 60*(4.0889 + 0.52) = 60*(4.6089) ≈ 276.534

Now, discount this back 15 years.

(P/F,7%,15) = 1/(1.07)^15 ≈ 1/(2.1969) ≈ 0.4556

So PW_total_gas_20 = 276.534 * 0.4556 ≈ 125.93

Now, add the initial cost of $8,000: PW_total_20 = 8000 + 125.93 ≈ 8125.93

Now, compute EUAC_20 using (A/P,7%,20).

(A/P,7%,20) = [i*(1+i)^n]/[(1+i)^n -1] = 0.07*(1.07)^20 / [(1.07)^20 -1]

Compute (1.07)^20 ≈ 3.0690

So numerator: 0.07 *3.0690 ≈ 0.21483

Denominator: 3.0690 -1 = 2.0690

So (A/P,7%,20) ≈ 0.21483 / 2.0690 ≈ 0.1038 or 10.38%

So EUAC_20 = PW_total_20 * 0.1038 ≈ 8125.93 * 0.1038 ≈ 843.33 dollars per year.

Wait, that seems a bit low. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the (P/G) calculation. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the present worth of the gas losses more accurately.

Alternatively, maybe the initial approach is correct, but let me proceed and compute the 25-year case to see.

For 25-year case:

n=10 years of gas loss (years 16-25).

Compute (P/A,7%,10) and (P/G,7%,10).

Compute (P/A,7%,10):

(1.07)^10 ≈ 1.9671

1/(1.07)^10 ≈ 0.5083

[1 - 0.5083]/0.07 ≈ 0.4917 /0.07 ≈ 7.024

So (P/A,7%,10)=7.024

Compute (P/G,7%,10):

Using formula: (1/i) [ (1 - (1+i)^-n ) - i *n*(1+i)^-n ]

i=0.07, n=10.

= (1/0.07)[ (1 - 0.5083) - 0.07*10 *0.5083 ]

= (1/0.07)[0.4917 - 0.0356*0.5083 ]

Wait, 0.07*10=0.7, so 0.7*0.5083≈0.3563

So 0.4917 - 0.3563 = 0.1354

Multiply by 1/0.07: 0.1354/0.07 ≈ 1.934

So (P/G,7%,10)=1.934

Thus, PW_10 =60 *7.024 +60 *1.934

=60*(7.024 +1.934)=60*(8.958)=537.48

Now, discount back 15 years: 1/(1.07)^15≈0.4556

PW_total_gas_25=537.48 * 0.4556≈245.02

Add initial cost: PW_total_25=8000 +245.02≈8245.02

Now, compute EUAC_25 using (A/P,7%,25).

Compute (A/P,7%,25) = 0.07*(1.07)^25 / [(1.07)^25 -1]

(1.07)^25 ≈ 5.4163

Numerator: 0.07 *5.4163≈0.3791

Denominator:5.4163 -1=4.4163

So (A/P)≈0.3791/4.4163≈0.0858 or 8.58%

So EUAC_25=8245.02 *0.0858≈707.16 dollars per year.

Wait a minute, so for 20 years, the EUAC is about $843, and for 25 years, it's about $707. So the 25-year EUAC is lower.

Wait, but that can't be right because the 25-year case has more years of gas loss, which increases the present worth of the losses, but spreads the initial cost over more years. Hmm.

Wait, let me think again. The 25-year case has a higher present worth of gas losses because the losses go on for 10 years instead of 5. But when calculating EUAC, which spreads the cost over more years, the annual cost might be lower.

Wait, in the 20-year case, the total present worth is 8125.93, leading to an EUAC of about 843.

In the 25-year case, the total present worth is 8245.02, which is actually less than 8125? No, wait, 8245 is higher than 8125
