Okay, so I've got this question about constitutive moral luck, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my philosophy terms, but let me think this through.

First, I remember that moral luck is a concept in ethics. It's about how our moral judgments can be influenced by factors that are beyond our control. There are different types of moral luck, like resultant, causal, and constitutive. 

Constitutive moral luck, if I recall correctly, has to do with the kind of person we are. It's about the traits or characteristics that make us who we are, which in turn affect our moral worth. So, it's like, if someone is naturally kind, that's a part of their moral character, but it's due to factors they can't control, like their upbringing or genetics.

The question is asking for an example of bad constitutive moral luck. So, we're looking for a situation where someone's inherent traits lead to a negative moral judgment, but these traits aren't entirely their fault because they're part of who they are.

Looking at the options:

A: Person who donates to charity regularly. That's a positive trait, so probably not bad luck.

C: Lived in Nazi Germany in 1940. Wait, that's more about the environment they're in. That might relate to circumstantial luck, where the circumstances (like living under a regime) affect their moral actions.

D: Person who drives drunk and hits a child. That's a resultant moral luck situation. The drunk driving is the action, and the bad outcome (hitting a child) makes it worse morally. But this is more about the consequences rather than inherent traits.

F: Naturally kind and generous. Again, positive, so not bad.

G: Lived in the US in the 1960s. That's circumstantial again, maybe about the social context, like the civil rights movement. Doesn't directly relate to personal traits.

I: By nature envious and ungenerous. Oh, this seems like a negative trait that's part of their constitution. So, if someone is naturally envious, that's part of who they are, and that would contribute to negative moral judgments. This fits constitutive moral luck because it's about their inherent character.

J: Lives in a peaceful, affluent country. That's circumstantial again, not about their personal traits.

So, the correct answer should be option I. It's an example where a person's inherent, natural traits lead to a negative moral assessment, which is constitutive moral luck.

The correct answer is:

I: a person who is by nature envious and ungenerous.

This option exemplifies bad constitutive moral luck because it describes inherent traits that lead to negative moral judgment, which are beyond the individual's control.

Answer: I
