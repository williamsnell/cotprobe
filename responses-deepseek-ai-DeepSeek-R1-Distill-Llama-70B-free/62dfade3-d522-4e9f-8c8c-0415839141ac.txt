Okay, so I have this chemistry problem to solve, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these molality calculations. But I'll take it step by step.

Alright, the question is asking for the molality of a solution where 49 grams of H2SO4 is dissolved in 250 grams of water. I remember that molality is moles of solute per kilogram of solvent. So, I need to find out how many moles of sulfuric acid I have and then divide that by the mass of the water in kilograms. Let me break this down.

First, I need the molar mass of H2SO4. The formula is H2SO4, which means two hydrogens, one sulfur, and four oxygens. So, calculating the molar mass: Hydrogen is about 1 g/mol each, so 2*1 = 2. Sulfur is 32.07 g/mol, and each oxygen is 16.00 g/mol, so 4*16 = 64. Adding those together: 2 + 32.07 + 64 = 98.07 g/mol. So the molar mass is approximately 98 g/mol, which matches what the problem stated.

Next, I have 49 grams of H2SO4. To find the number of moles, I divide the mass by the molar mass. So moles = 49 g / 98 g/mol. Let me compute that. 49 divided by 98 is 0.5. So that's 0.5 moles of H2SO4.

Wait, but sulfuric acid is a diprotic acid, right? So each molecule can donate two protons. But wait, no, wait a second. Oh, right, in molality calculations, we're only concerned with the number of moles of the solute, not how it dissociates. So whether it's diprotic or not doesn't matter here because molality is just about the solute particles before dissociation. So I don't need to multiply by 2 or anything. So it's just 0.5 moles of H2SO4.

Now, the solvent is water. The mass of the solvent is given as 250 grams. I need to convert that to kilograms because molality uses kg. So 250 grams is 0.25 kg. Wait, no, wait, 1000 grams is 1 kg. So 250 grams is 0.25 kg, right? Wait, wait, no, 250 grams is a quarter of a kilogram? Oh wait, no, wait. 1 kg is 1000 g, so 250 g is 0.25 kg? No, wait, 250 is a quarter of 1000, so yes, 0.25 kg. Hmm.

Wait, no, no, wait. 250 grams is 0.25 kg? Let me double-check. 1 kg is 1000 g. So 250 divided by 1000 is 0.25. Yes, that's correct.

So now, molality (m) is moles of solute divided by kg of solvent. So m = 0.5 moles / 0.25 kg. Let me compute that. 0.5 divided by 0.25 is 2. So the molality is 2.0 moles per kg.

Looking at the options, option A is 2.0 moles/kg, so that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait a minute. Oh, wait, no, because H2SO4 is a strong acid, but in terms of molality, it doesn't matter. The question is only about the concentration, not the dissociation. So no, no, I was right the first time. So yes, the answer is 2.0 mol/kg, which is option A.

To determine the molality of the solution, we start by calculating the number of moles of H₂SO₄. The molar mass of H₂SO₄ is given as 98 g/mol. The mass of H₂SO₄ is 49 g, so the number of moles is:

\[
\text{Moles of H₂SO₄} = \frac{\text{Mass of H₂SO₄}}{\text{Molar Mass of H₂SO₄}} = \frac{49}{98} = 0.5 \, \text{moles}.
\]

Next, the mass of the solvent (water) is 250 g, which is converted to kilograms:

\[
\text{Mass of solvent in kg} = \frac{250}{1000} = 0.25 \, \text{kg}.
\]

Molality (\(m\)) is defined as the number of moles of solute per kilogram of solvent:

\[
m = \frac{\text{Moles of H₂SO₄}}{\text{Mass of solvent in kg}} = \frac{0.5}{0.25} = 2.0 \, \text{moles/kg}.
\]

Thus, the molality of the solution is 2.0 moles/kg. The correct answer is:

A: 2.0 moles/kg
