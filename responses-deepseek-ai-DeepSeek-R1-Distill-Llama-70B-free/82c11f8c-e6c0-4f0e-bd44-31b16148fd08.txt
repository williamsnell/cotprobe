Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this genetics problem about cystic fibrosis incidence in different populations and their offspring. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disorder. That means both copies of the gene need to be defective for the disease to manifest. So, each parent must contribute a defective allele for the child to have the disease.

The problem states that in Caucasians, the incidence is about 1 in 2,000 births. Among nonwhites, it's 1 in 250,000. I need to find the incidence when Caucasians and nonwhites mate, and then when their offspring mate randomly among themselves.

Let me break it down. 

First part: Caucasians and nonwhites mating. 

I think I should find the carrier rates in each population. For a recessive disease, the incidence (q²) is given. So I can find q, the frequency of the recessive allele.

For Caucasians:
Incidence is 1/2000. So q² = 1/2000 → q = sqrt(1/2000). Let me calculate that. The square root of 1/2000 is approximately 0.02236. So q ≈ 2.236%.

For nonwhites:
Incidence is 1/250,000. So q²=1/250000 → q= 1/sqrt(250000). Let's compute that. The square root of 250000 is 500, so 1/500=0.002, so q = 0.2%.

Wait, wait. Wait, 1/250,000 is 0.000004. Square root of that is approx 0.002, which is 0.2%. So yes.

So in the Caucasian population, the allele frequency is about 2.236%, and in nonwhites, 0.2%.

When a Caucasian and a nonwhite mate, what's the chance their child has CF?

Each parent contributes one allele. The Caucasian parent has a 2.236% chance of passing the recessive allele, and the nonwhite a 0.2% chance. Since the child needs two recessive alleles, one from each parent.

Wait no, wait. Wait, no. Because each parent gives one allele. So the child would get one from each. So for the child to have CF, they must get two recessive alleles. But each parent is giving one allele each. So for the child to have CF, both parents must pass the recessive allele.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, if the father is from a population where the allele frequency is q1, and the mother from q2, then the probability that the child gets two recessive alleles is q1 * q2.

Wait, no, wait. No. Because each parent gives one allele. So the child gets one allele from each parent. So the chance that each parent gives the recessive allele is q for each. So the chance of the child being affected is q_Caucasian * q_nonwhite.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because each parent is likely not affected themselves. Because the incidence is low. So the parents are probably carriers or not.

Wait, but the question is about matings between Caucasians and nonwhites. So each parent is from one group.

Wait, but the parents are from the two different populations. So the Caucasian parent's genotype is likely not affected but could be a carrier. Same with nonwhite.

But for an autosomal recessive disease, the parents must each carry at least one recessive allele to have an affected child. But considering that the incidence is low, the chance that each is a carrier is higher than being affected.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to model this.

Let me consider that in a population with incidence q², the allele frequency q is sqrt(incidence). Because q² = incidence.

So for the Caucasian population, q1 = sqrt(1/2000) ≈ 0.02236 (~2.24%). For nonwhites, q2 = sqrt(1/250000) ≈ 0.002 (~0.2%).

When a Caucasian and a nonwhite mate, what's the probability that their child has CF?

The child must inherit two recessive alleles: one from each parent. So the chance is q1 * q2.

Wait, no. Because each parent can only contribute one allele. So the child will have a 50% chance of getting the recessive allele from each parent, but only if the parent is a carrier.

Wait, no. Wait, wait. The parents are from populations with certain allele frequencies.

Wait, perhaps I should model each parent's genotype. But that could get complicated. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to find the carrier rate in each population and then compute the probability that both parents are carriers.

Wait, but if the parents are from the two different groups, the chance that they each carry the recessive allele and pass it on.

Alternatively, the chance that the father (Caucasian) is a carrier is 2q1 (since for a recessive disease, the carrier frequency is 2q, when the disease is rare), and similarly for the nonwhite mother, 2q2.

Wait, but is that correct? Let me think. For a disease with allele frequency q, the Hardy-Weinberg equation gives genotype frequencies as p² (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q² (homozygous recessive). So the carrier frequency is 2pq ≈ 2q when p is approximately 1 (since q is small).

So in the Caucasian population, the carrier rate is approximately 2q1 = 2*(0.02236) ≈ 4.47%. Similarly, in nonwhites, 2q2 ≈ 0.4%.

But wait, the parents are mating between the groups. So the chance that the father is a carrier is about 4.47%, and the mother's chance is 0.4% (since only nonwhite). Wait, no, wait. Wait, the nonwhite's carrier rate is 0.4%, so the chance the nonwhite parent is a carrier is 0.4%? Or is it the allele frequency?

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, the probability that a Caucasian is a carrier is 2q1, and a nonwhite is 2q2.

So the chance that both are carriers is (2q1) * (2q2) = 4 q1 q2.

But wait, no. Because each parent is from a different population. So the father is from the Caucasian group, so he has a 2q1 chance of being a carrier. The mother is from nonwhite, so 2q2. So the chance they both are carriers is (2q1) * (2q2) = 4 q1 q2.

Then, if both are carriers, the chance that they each pass the recessive allele is 25% (since each has a 50% chance to pass it, so 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25).

Wait, but wait. Wait, no. Because each parent is a carrier, meaning they have one dominant and one recessive allele. So when they mate, the chance that they each pass the recessive allele is 0.5 for each. So the chance the child gets two recessive alleles is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.

Therefore, the total probability that their child has CF is (probability both parents are carriers) * (probability child gets both recessive alleles) = (2q1 * 2q2) * (1/4) = q1 q2.

Wait, let me see: (2q1)(2q2) is 4 q1 q2. Multiply by 1/4 (the chance each gives the recessive allele), so 4 q1 q2 * 1/4 = q1 q2.

So the incidence would be q1 * q2.

So q1 is sqrt(1/2000) ≈ 0.02236, q2 is sqrt(1/250000) ≈ 0.002.

Multiply them: 0.02236 * 0.002 = 0.00004472.

So the incidence would be 0.00004472, which is 4.472e-5.

To find 1/incidence, that's approximately 1 / 0.00004472 ≈ 22355. So roughly 1 in 22,355.

Wait, but looking at the options, none of them have 22,000 as the first part. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option I: 1 in 22,000; 1 in 6,700.

Wait, 22,355 is close to 22,000, so option I's first part is 1/22,000. Hmm. So that's the first part.

Wait, but wait. Wait, I'm not so sure. Let me re-calculate.

q1 is 1/2000's square root: 1/2000 is 0.0005. Square root of 0.0005 is approximately 0.02236. Correct.

q2 is 1/250000's square root. 1/250000 is 0.000004. Square root is 0.002. Correct.

So q1*q2= 0.02236 * 0.002 = 0.00004472. So 0.00004472 is 4.472e-5.

1 divided by 0.00004472 is approximately 22355. So 1 in 22,355, which is about 1 in 22,000. So the first part would be around 22,000, which matches option I's first part.

But wait, option I gives 1 in 22,000 for the first part, and 1 in 6,700 for the second. Hmm. Let me proceed to the second part.

Second part: the offspring of these matings mate randomly among themselves. What's the incidence?

So the initial cross is between a Caucasian and a nonwhite. Let's model the allele frequencies in their offspring.

Each child gets one allele from the Caucasian parent and one from the nonwhite parent.

Wait, no. No, each parent may or may not carry the recessive allele. Wait, but in the first part, we're considering the incidence when Caucasians and nonwhites mate. But for the second part, the children of such matings are now a new population, and they mate among themselves.

Wait, perhaps the approach is to calculate the allele frequency in the hybrid population first.

Let me think: when a Caucasian and a nonwhite mate, their child will have a certain allele frequency. But wait, each child gets one allele from each parent. So the chance that the child has the recessive allele from the Caucasian parent is q1, and from the nonwhite parent is q2. So the child is more likely to have the recessive allele if the parents are carriers.

Wait, no. Wait, perhaps I should model the allele frequency in the F1 generation.

Wait, perhaps each F1 individual has a certain probability of having the recessive allele. Let me think.

If the parents are from two populations with allele frequencies q1 and q2, then each child will have an allele from each parent. So the chance that a child has the recessive allele is q1 (from the Caucasian) and q2 (from nonwhite). Wait, no, each child gets one allele from each parent, so the genotype would be Aa, where A is the dominant allele and a is recessive. Or AA if both are dominant, or aa if both are recessive.

Wait, no, that's more about genotype, but perhaps I'm complicating things. Alternatively, the allele frequency in the F1 population would be the average of the two parents' allele frequencies.

Wait, but allele frequencies in the offspring would be (q1 + q2)/2. Because each parent contributes either q1 or q2.

Wait, no. Wait, the allele frequency in the F1 would be the average of the allele frequencies of the two parents. So for example, if population A has allele frequency q_A, and population B q_B, then the F1 would have q_F1 = (q_A + q_B)/2.

Wait, but that's only if the parents are randomly mating and each contributes an allele. So for each gamete, the chance of carrying the recessive allele is q_A from one parent, and q_B from the other. So the F1's allele frequency is (q_A + q_B)/2.

So in this case, q1 is 0.02236, q2 is 0.002. So q_F1 = (0.02236 + 0.002)/2 = 0.02436 / 2 = 0.01218, approximately 1.218%.

So the allele frequency in the F1 population is approximately 1.218%.

Now, when these F1 individuals mate randomly among themselves, what is the incidence of CF in their offspring?

Well, it's a Hardy-Weinberg scenario. The incidence (q_F1)^2.

So q_F1 is 0.01218, so (0.01218)^2 ≈ 0.0001487.

So the incidence is approximately 0.0001487, which is 1/6740, roughly. Because 1/6740 is about 0.0001485.

Wait, 1/6740 is approximately 0.0001485. So 0.0001487 is about 1 in 6739, which is approximately 1 in 6,700.

Looking back at the options, option I's second part is 1 in 6,700. So that matches.

So the first incidence is about 1/22,000, and the second about 1/6,700.

So the correct answer should be option I: 1 in 22,000; 1 in 6,700.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations.

Wait, the first part: the incidence is q1*q2. q1 is 0.02236, q2 is 0.002. So 0.02236 * 0.002 = 0.00004472. So 1/22355 ≈ 4.47e-5. So 1 in ~22,355, which is approximately 22,000. So option I's first part is correct.

Second part: allele frequency in F1 is (0.02236 + 0.002)/2 = 0.01218. Squared is 0.0001487, which is 1/6740, which rounds to 1/6700, so 6,700. So the second part is correct.

So the correct option is I.
</think>

To solve the problem, we analyze the incidence of cystic fibrosis (CF), an autosomal recessive disorder, in two populations: Caucasians and nonwhites. The incidence in Caucasians is 1 in 2,000 births, and in nonwhites, it is 1 in 250,000 births. The goal is to determine the incidence among offspring of matings between Caucasians and nonwhites and then among the offspring of these matings when they mate randomly.

### Part 1: Incidence among matings between Caucasians and nonwhites
For an autosomal recessive disease, the incidence in a population is given by \( q^2 \), where \( q \) is the frequency of the recessive allele. 

1. **Caucasian population**:  
   Incidence \( = \frac{1}{2000} \), so \( q_1 = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2000}} \approx 0.02236 \) (2.236%).  

2. **Nonwhite population**:  
   Incidence \( = \frac{1}{250,000} \), so \( q_2 = \sqrt{\frac{1}{250,000}} \approx 0.002 \) (0.2%).  

When a Caucasian and a nonwhite mate, the probability that their child has CF is the product of the probabilities of each parent passing the recessive allele:  
\[
\text{Incidence} = q_1 \cdot q_2 = 0.02236 \cdot 0.002 = 0.00004472
\]  
This corresponds to approximately \( \frac{1}{22,355} \), which is closest to \( \frac{1}{22,000} \).

### Part 2: Incidence among offspring mating randomly
The offspring of Caucasians and nonwhites form a new population (F1 generation). The allele frequency of the recessive allele in this population is the average of the allele frequencies from the two parent populations:  
\[
q_{\text{F1}} = \frac{q_1 + q_2}{2} = \frac{0.02236 + 0.002}{2} = 0.01218 \text{ (1.218%).}
\]  
When these offspring mate randomly, the incidence of CF in their offspring is given by \( q_{\text{F1}}^2 \):  
\[
\text{Incidence} = (0.01218)^2 \approx 0.0001487
\]  
This corresponds to approximately \( \frac{1}{6,740} \), which is closest to \( \frac{1}{6,700} \).

### Final Answer
The incidence among matings between Caucasians and nonwhites is approximately \( \frac{1}{22,000} \), and among their offspring mating randomly, it is approximately \( \frac{1}{6,700} \). The correct option is:

**I: 1 in 22,000 births; 1 in 6,700 births**
