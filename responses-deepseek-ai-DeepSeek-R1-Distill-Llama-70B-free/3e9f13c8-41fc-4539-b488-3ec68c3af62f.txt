Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a projectile. Hmm, I need to find the speed at impact when it's fired with an initial speed of 200 m/s at an angle of elevation of 60 degrees. Alright, let me think about what I remember from projectile motion.

Wait, projectile motion... Oh right, when a projectile is launched, it has two components of velocity: horizontal and vertical. The horizontal component is v0 * cos(theta), and the vertical is v0 * sin(theta). So the initial speed is 200 m/s at 60 degrees.

So first, let me break down the initial velocity into components. The horizontal part would be 200 * cos(60°), which is 200 * 0.5, so that's 100 m/s. The vertical part is 200 * sin(60°), and sin(60) is about 0.866, so 200 * 0.866 is approximately 173.2 m/s.

Now, when the projectile is in motion, the horizontal velocity stays the same because there's no air resistance (assuming it's negligible). But the vertical velocity changes due to gravity. Oh wait, when the projectile hits the ground, it comes back down, so the vertical displacement is zero if we're considering the same elevation. So the time of flight would depend on the vertical motion.

Wait, no, actually, the time to reach the maximum height and then come back down. But wait, the impact is when it lands, right? So the time taken to go up and come back down. Hmm, but maybe there's a smarter way to find the final velocity without calculating the time.

I remember that for projectile motion, the kinetic energy at launch and impact are related, but only if we consider whether air resistance is present or not. Since the problem doesn't mention air resistance, I can probably ignore it, meaning mechanical energy is conserved. Oh wait, but that's only if the path is symmetric. Actually, no, if the projectile lands at the same elevation from which it was launched, then the speed at impact is the same as the initial speed. Oh wait, that can't be right because the initial speed is 200 m/s, which is option F, but I don't see 200 as an option in the given options. Wait, no, let me check the options again.

Looking at the options: option F is 200 m/s. So if that's the case, the speed at impact would be the same as the initial speed because it lands at the same height. But wait, is that the case here?

Wait, wait, the problem says "impact", which I'm assuming is when it hits the ground, which is the same elevation. So if that's true, then the speed would be the same as the initial speed, so 200 m/s, which is option F. But wait, that seems too straightforward. Am I missing something?

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering the vertical component only. No, the speed is the magnitude of the velocity vector, which includes both horizontal and vertical components. So at impact, the horizontal velocity remains 100 m/s, and the vertical velocity would be same as the initial upward but negative, because it's coming down.

Wait a second, the vertical component when it lands would have the same magnitude as when it was launched but in the opposite direction. So the vertical velocity when it hits the ground is -v0y, which is -173.2 m/s. So the speed is sqrt((100)^2 + (173.2)^2). Let me calculate that.

100 squared is 10,000. 173.2 squared is approximately (170^2 is 28900, and 3.2^2 is 10.24, and cross term 2*170*3.2=1088, so total approx 28900 + 1088 +10.24=29998.24). Wait, wait, that's for 173.2. So 100^2 + (173.2)^2 = 10,000 + 29998.24 = 40998.24. The square root of that is sqrt(40998.24) ≈ 202.47 m/s.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options. The closest option is B (225), which is higher. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, maybe I should think about it using energy conservation. The initial kinetic energy is (1/2)mv_initial². When it hits the ground, assuming no energy loss, the kinetic energy would be the same, so the speed would be the same. So that brings me back to 200 m/s as the speed at impact. But that would mean the answer is F.

But in reality, when you fire a projectile straight up, it comes down with the same speed. But when fired at an angle, the horizontal component remains, so the impact speed is higher than the initial vertical component. Wait, but that's only if the projectile lands at a different elevation. Wait no, if it lands at the same elevation, the speed is the same as the initial speed.

So perhaps the correct answer is F, 200 m/s. But wait, another thought: maybe the question is considering only the vertical component, but that doesn't make sense because speed is the magnitude of the vector sum.

Wait, let me think again. If the projectile is launched and returns to the same elevation, its speed should be the same as initial because the kinetic energy is conserved (assuming no air resistance). So that would mean the speed is 200 m/s, which is option F.

But earlier, I did the calculation for the components and got around 202.47 m/s, which isn't 200. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in that part. Let me recheck the calculation.

The horizontal velocity is 100 m/s. The vertical velocity when it impacts should be the same magnitude as the initial vertical component but negative. So v_y = -173.2 m/s. So the speed is sqrt(100^2 + (173.2)^2). Let me compute that more accurately.

100^2 = 10,000.

173.2^2: 173 * 173 is (170+3)^2 = 170² + 2*170*3 +3²= 28900 + 1020 +9= 29929. Then 0.2^2 is 0.04, so (173.2)^2 = (173 + 0.2)^2 = 173^2 + 2*173*0.2 + 0.2^2 = 29929 + 69.2 + 0.04= 300,  let's see, 29929 +69.2 is 300, so 29929+69.2=300, so 29929 +69.2=300, no, wait 29929 +69.2 is 300, that can't be. Wait 29929 + 69.2 = 29929 + 69 = 300, no, 29929 + 60=29989, plus 9.2 is 300, 29989 +9.2=300, so 300, so wait, 29929 +69.2=300, so 300, so 300, so 300. So 173.2 squared is 300, approximately? Wait, but 173.2 squared is actually (200 - 26.8)^2, but maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, I can calculate 173.2 * 173.2.

Let me compute 173.2 * 173.2.

Let's break it into (170 + 3.2) * (170 + 3.2) = 170² + 2*170*3.2 + 3.2².

170²=28900.

2*170*3.2=340 *3.2=1088.

3.2²=10.24.

Adding them up: 28900 + 1088=29988 +10.24=29998.24.

So 173.2 squared is 29998.24.

So 100^2 + 173.2^2 = 10,000 + 29,998.24 = 39,998.24.

Square root of 39,998.24: let's see, 200^2 is 40,000. So sqrt(39,998.24) is just a bit less than 200. Because 200^2 is 40,000, so 39,998.24 is 1.76 less than 40,000. So sqrt(39998.24)= 199.96 m/s, approximately 200 m/s.

Ah, that's why the speed is 200 m/s. So the initial calculation was a bit confusing, but it turns out to be approximately 200 m/s. So the correct answer is F: 200 m/s.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me think again. The initial speed is 200 m/s. The projectile is fired at 60 degrees. So when it lands, the speed is the same as when it was fired because the vertical component is reversed, but the magnitude remains same. So the speed is 200 m/s.

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer should be F.

To determine the speed at impact of a projectile fired with an initial speed of $200 \, \mathrm{m/s}$ at an angle of elevation of $60^\circ$, we analyze the motion using the principles of projectile dynamics.

1. **Breaking Down the Initial Velocity**:  
   The initial velocity can be resolved into horizontal and vertical components:  
   - Horizontal velocity: $v_{0x} = v_0 \cos(60^\circ) = 200 \cdot 0.5 = 100 \, \mathrm{m/s}$.  
   - Vertical velocity: $v_{0y} = v_0 \sin(60^\circ) = 200 \cdot \sqrt{3}/2 \approx 173.2 \, \mathrm{m/s}$.  

2. **Horizontal and Vertical Motion**:  
   - The horizontal velocity remains constant throughout the motion because there is no air resistance.  
   - The vertical velocity changes due to gravity. When the projectile returns to the same elevation from which it was launched, the vertical velocity at impact will have the same magnitude as the initial vertical velocity but in the opposite direction ($-v_{0y}$).  

3. **Speed at Impact**:  
   The speed at impact is the magnitude of the resultant velocity vector, which includes both horizontal and vertical components:  
   \[
   v = \sqrt{v_{x}^2 + v_{y}^2}.
   \]  
   Substituting the values:  
   \[
   v = \sqrt{100^2 + 173.2^2}.
   \]  
   - $100^2 = 10,000$.  
   - $173.2^2 \approx 29,998.24$.  
   - $v = \sqrt{10,000 + 29,998.24} = \sqrt{39,998.24} \approx 199.96 \, \mathrm{m/s}$.  

4. **Energy Conservation Insight**:  
   Since the projectile returns to the same elevation and air resistance is neglected, the total mechanical energy (and thus the speed) at impact is the same as the initial speed. This confirms that the speed at impact is approximately $200 \, \mathrm{m/s}$.  

Thus, the speed at impact is **200 m/s**, which corresponds to option **F**.
