Question:

Describe the structural theory of language acquisition. Define generative grammar.

Options:

A: The structural theory of language acquisition maintains that language acquisition is an innate capacity and humans are governed by certain innate principles. Generative grammar is the set of rules that determine how the language is structured.
B: Generative grammar is a dictionary of all the words in a language
C: Language acquisition depends entirely on social interaction without any innate mechanisms
D: Generative grammar is the restrictive rules of a language
E: Language acquisition is a learned behavior
F: The structural theory posits that language is learned through conditioning and reinforcement, and generative grammar is the catalog of phrases used in daily communication
G: Language acquisition is solely a product of direct instruction and imitation
H: Language acquisition is not correlated with motor development
I: Generative grammar refers to the universal ability to create an infinite number of sentences using a finite set of elements
J: The structural theory suggests that language acquisition is primarily influenced by environmental factors

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about language acquisition theories and generative grammar. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

The question asks to describe the structural theory of language acquisition and define generative grammar. The options are from A to J. Let me recall what I know about these topics.

First, structural theory. I remember that there are different theories about how humans acquire language. One of them is the behaviorist approach, which suggests that language is learned through environment, like conditioning and reinforcement. But wait, the question is about the structural theory. Oh right, structuralism in linguistics focuses on the underlying structure of language, but I'm not sure if that's the same as the structural theory of acquisition.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Another key figure is Noam Chomsky, who proposed that language acquisition is innate. His theory is often referred to as the nativist approach. So the structural theory here might be referring to Chomsky's ideas. Because Chomsky's generative grammar is a big part of this. So the structural theory would posit that humans have an innate capacity for language, governed by certain principles.

Now, generative grammar. From what I remember, generative grammar is a concept developed by Chomsky. It refers to the idea that the human brain has an innate capacity to generate an infinite number of sentences from a finite set of rules and elements. So it's about the ability to create new sentences, not just memorize them. That's the essence of generative grammar.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the structural theory maintains that acquisition is an innate capacity with certain innate principles, and generative grammar is the set of rules determining language structure. That sounds right because it aligns with Chomsky's ideas. So A could be correct.

Option B says generative grammar is a dictionary of words. No, that's not right. It's about sentence formation, not a list of words.

Option C claims acquisition depends entirely on social interaction without innate mechanisms. That's more like the empiricist view, maybe the behaviorist approach, not structural theory.

Option D: Generative grammar as restrictive rules. Hmm, perhaps, but I think the key is it's a set of rules that allow for generating sentences, so maybe D is partially correct but I'm not sure.

Option E: Acquisition is learned behavior. That's the opposite of innate, so probably not.

Option F: Structural theory through conditioning, generative grammar as phrases. No, that sounds more like behaviorist theory, not structural. Plus, generative grammar isn't just a catalog of phrases.

Option G: Acquisition solely from instruction and imitation. That's too narrow; Chomsky's theory says it's innate, so this doesn't fit.

Option H: Acquisition not linked to motor development. I don't think that's relevant here; the question is about structural theory and generative grammar.

Option I: Generative grammar is the ability to create infinite sentences from finite elements. Yes, that's exactly what I was thinking. So this part is correct, but does it match the structural theory part?

Wait, the question asks to describe both the structural theory and define generative grammar. So the correct answer should cover both parts accurately.

Looking back at option A: It says the structural theory is about innate capacity and generative grammar as the set of rules. That seems correct.

Option I only defines generative grammar correctly but doesn't mention the structural theory, so it might not be the answer since the question asks to describe both.

Wait, the question says to select the option that does both: describe the structural theory and define generative grammar.

So option A does both. It says the structural theory is about innate capacity, and generative grammar is the set of rules determining structure. That fits with Chomsky's theory.

Option I only defines generative grammar correctly but doesn't talk about the structural theory, so it's not the right choice for the entire question.

Therefore, the correct answer should be A.
</think>

The correct answer is:

A: The structural theory of language acquisition maintains that language acquisition is an innate capacity and humans are governed by certain innate principles. Generative grammar is the set of rules that determine how the language is structured.

This option accurately describes both the structural theory, which aligns with Chomsky's nativist approach emphasizing innate capacities, and defines generative grammar as the set of rules enabling the generation of sentences.

Answer: A
