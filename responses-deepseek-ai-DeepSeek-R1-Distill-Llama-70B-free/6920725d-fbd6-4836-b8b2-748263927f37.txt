Okay, so I've got this problem here about water evaporation and vapor pressure. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. 

The question says there's a vessel with 1.15 grams of liquid H₂O in equilibrium with water vapor at 30°C. The vapor pressure at that temperature is 31.82 torr. They're asking what volume increase is needed for all the water to evaporate. 

First, I remember that when a liquid and its vapor are in equilibrium, the vapor exerts a certain pressure. To find out how much volume is needed for the liquid to evaporate completely, I think we can use the ideal gas law. Because the vapor is acting like an ideal gas here, right?

So, the steps I need to take are probably:

1. Find the number of moles of water present. Since it's 1.15 grams, I can use the molar mass of H₂O. The molar mass is 18 g/mol, because H is about 1 each and O is 16. So 1.15 g divided by 18 g/mol gives me the moles.

Let me calculate that: 1.15 / 18 = approximately 0.0639 moles.

Wait, actually, wait: 1.15 divided by 18. Let me see: 18 times 0.06 is 1.08, so 0.0639 is right. So n ≈ 0.0639 mol.

2. Next, I need to find the volume that this amount of water vapor would occupy at 30°C, which is 303.15 K (since 30 + 273.15). The pressure is given as 31.82 torr. 

Wait, but the ideal gas law uses pressure in atmospheres. So I should convert that. I remember that 1 atm is 760 torr. So 31.82 torr is 31.82 / 760 atm.

Let me compute that: 31.82 / 760. Let's see, 760 divided by 30 is about 25.3, so 31.82 is roughly 760/25.3 ≈ 0.04198 atm. Hmm, wait, actually, wait: 31.82 ÷ 760 = ?

Let me compute 31.82 ÷ 760. 

So 760 goes into 31.82 how many times? 760 * 0.04 is 30.4. 31.82 -30.4 is 1.42. So 0.04 plus (1.42 /760) = approximately 0.04 + 0.001868 = 0.041868 atm. So about 0.04187 atm.

3. Now, using PV = nRT. We can solve for V. 

R is the gas constant, which is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K.

So V = (n R T) / P.

Plugging in the numbers:

n = 0.0639 mol,

R = 0.0821,

T = 303.15 K,

P = 0.04187 atm.

So V = (0.0639 * 0.0821 * 303.15) / 0.04187.

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, multiply n and R: 0.0639 * 0.0821 = let's see, 0.06 * 0.08 is 0.0048, and then the extra decimals. 0.0639 *0.08 is 0.005112, but 0.0821 is a bit more. Let me compute it more accurately.

0.0639 * 0.0821:

Multiply 639 * 821, then account for the decimals. 639 *800 is 511200, 639 *21=13419. So 524,619. So 0.0639 is 6.39e-2, and 0.0821 is 8.21e-2. So 6.39e-2 *8.21e-2 = (6.39 *8.21) * 1e-4.

6 *8 is 48. 6 *0.21 is 1.26. 0.39 *8 is 3.12. 0.39 *0.21 is about 0.0819. So adding up:

48 +1.26 +3.12 +0.0819 = approximately 52.4619. So 52.4619e-4 = 0.00524619 L·atm/mol·K? Wait, no, wait. Wait, actually, the units for R are L·atm/mol·K, so when you multiply n (mol) by R (L·atm/mol·K) and T (K), you get L·atm.

Wait, but no, R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K, so when you multiply n*R*T, the units are (mol)*(L·atm/mol·K)*K = L·atm. Then divide by P (atm), so V is in L.

So, n*R*T = 0.0639 * 0.0821 * 303.15.

Let me compute that:

0.0639 * 0.0821 = let's compute 0.06 *0.08 = 0.0048. 0.0639 is 0.06 + 0.0039.

Compute 0.0039 *0.0821 = 0.000320. So 0.0048 + 0.000320 is 0.00512.

Wait, but perhaps a better way is to compute 0.0639 *0.0821.

0.0639 * 0.08 = 0.005112.

0.0639 * 0.0021 = 0.00013419.

Adding those gives 0.005112 + 0.00013419 = 0.00524619.

So n*R = 0.00524619.

Now multiply by T=303.15 K:

nRT = 0.00524619 * 303.15 = ?

Let me compute 0.005 * 300 = 1.5.

0.00524619 *303.15 = ?

Alternatively, break it down:

0.00524619 * 300 = 1.573857.

0.00524619 * 3.15 = ?

0.00524619 *3 = 0.01573857.

0.00524619 *0.15 = 0.0007869285.

So adding those: 0.01573857 + 0.0007869285 = 0.0165255.

So total nRT = 1.573857 + 0.0165255 = approx 1.59038 L·atm.

Then, V = (nRT) / P = 1.59038 / 0.04187.

Compute 1.59038 / 0.04187.

Hmm, let's see. 0.04187 is approximately 0.04, and 1.59 /0.04 is about 39.75, but let's compute more accurately.

Let me compute 1.59038 ÷ 0.04187:

Perhaps 0.04187 goes into 1.59038 how many times?

0.04187 * 38 = let's see:

0.04187 * 30 = 1.2561

0.04187 *8= 0.33496.

Adding them: 1.2561 + 0.33496 = 1.59106.

Oh, that's very close to 1.59038. So 38 times 0.04187 is 1.59106, which is just a bit more than 1.59038. So approximately 37.99 times. So V ≈ 38 L.

Wait, but wait, 38 *0.04187 = 1.591. So 1.59038 is 38 minus a tiny bit. So the volume is approximately 37.99 L, which is about 38 L.

Looking at the options, the closest one is H: 37.9 L. So the answer must be H.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might have made a mistake.

Wait, n was calculated as 1.15 g /18g/mol = 0.0639 mol. Correct.

Convert 31.82 torr to atm: 31.82 /760 = 0.04187 atm. Correct.

R is 0.0821, T is 303.15.

nRT is 0.0639 *0.0821 *303.15.

As I computed, that product is approximately 1.59038 L·atm.

Divide by P=0.04187 atm gives V≈38 L.

So the volume needed is about 38 liters. The options have H as 37.9 L, which matches. So the correct answer is H.

To determine the volume increase necessary for all the water to evaporate, we use the ideal gas law:

\[
PV = nRT \quad \text{or} \quad V = \frac{nRT}{P}
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the number of moles of water
The mass of water is given as \(1.15 \, \mathrm{g}\), and the molar mass of \(\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}\) is \(18 \, \mathrm{g/mol}\). Thus:

\[
n = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{molar mass}} = \frac{1.15}{18} \approx 0.0639 \, \mathrm{mol}
\]

### Step 2: Convert vapor pressure to atm
The vapor pressure of water at \(30^\circ \mathrm{C}\) is \(31.82 \, \mathrm{torr}\). Since \(1 \, \mathrm{atm} = 760 \, \mathrm{torr}\):

\[
P = \frac{31.82}{760} \approx 0.04187 \, \mathrm{atm}
\]

### Step 3: Use the ideal gas law to calculate the volume
The temperature is \(T = 30^\circ \mathrm{C} = 303.15 \, \mathrm{K}\), and the gas constant is \(R = 0.0821 \, \mathrm{L \cdot atm / (mol \cdot K)}\). Substituting into the ideal gas law:

\[
V = \frac{nRT}{P}
\]

\[
V = \frac{(0.0639)(0.0821)(303.15)}{0.04187}
\]

First, calculate \(nRT\):

\[
nRT = (0.0639)(0.0821)(303.15) \approx 1.59038 \, \mathrm{L \cdot atm}
\]

Now divide by \(P\):

\[
V = \frac{1.59038}{0.04187} \approx 38 \, \mathrm{L}
\]

### Step 4: Match the closest option
The calculated volume is approximately \(38 \, \mathrm{L}\), which corresponds to option **H: 37.9 L**.
