Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the tax rate for a town. Let's see, I need to find the tax rate in dollars per $100 of assessed valuation. Hmm, I remember that tax rates are usually calculated by dividing the total amount needed by the total assessed value, then multiplying by 100 to get it per $100.

The town's total assessed valuation is $6,250,000. They need $360,000 for education and $115,000 for health and welfare. So the total amount they need is the sum of these two, right? Let me add those up: 360,000 plus 115,000. That should be 475,000. Wait, no, wait, 360k plus 100k is 460k, plus 15k makes 475k. Yeah, so $475,000 total.

Now, the tax rate is calculated by taking the total tax required divided by the total assessed value, then multiplied by 100. So the formula is (Total Tax / Assessed Value) * 100. Let me plug in the numbers: 475,000 divided by 6,250,000.

Wait, let me do that division. 475,000 รท 6,250,000. Hmm, maybe I can simplify this. Let's see, both numerator and denominator can be divided by 25,000. Wait, 6,250,000 divided by 25,000 is 250. And 475,000 divided by 25,000 is 19. So now it's 19/250. What's that as a decimal? Let's see, 250 times 0.076 is 19. Because 0.07 * 250 is 17.5, and 0.076 *250 is 19. So that's 0.076.

But wait, I think I made a mistake in the division. Let me check again. Alternatively, I can think in terms of fractions. 475,000 divided by 6,250,000. Let me write this as 475/6250. Wait, because I can divide numerator and denominator by 1000 to make it easier. So 475 รท 6250.

Hmm, 6250 times 0.076 is 475. Because 6250 * 0.07 is 437.5, and 6250 * 0.006 is 37.5. 437.5 +37.5 is 475. So yes, 0.076. So that's 7.6% or $7.60 per $100.

Looking at the options, option E is $7.60 per $100. That should be the correct answer.

The town's total required funds are $475,000 ($360,000 for education + $115,000 for health and welfare). The tax rate is calculated as:

\[
\text{Tax Rate} = \left( \frac{\$475,000}{\$6,250,000} \right) \times 100 = 7.60\% = \$7.60 \text{ per } \$100.
\]

The correct answer is **E: $7.60 per $100**.
