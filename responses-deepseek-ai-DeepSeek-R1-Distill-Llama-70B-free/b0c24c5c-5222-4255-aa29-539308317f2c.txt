Okay, so I have this accounting question here about lease capitalization and how it affects the accountant's report. Let me try to think through this step by step.

Alright, the scenario is that during a review of a nonissuer's financial statements, the accountant found that some leases should be capitalized but aren't. And these leases are material, meaning they're significant enough to affect the financials. Management doesn't want to capitalize them, so the accountant has to modify the standard review report. The question is asking what the accountant should do in this situation.

First, I remember that reviews are different from audits. In a review, the accountant provides limited assurance, checking whether the financials are plausible and comply with the framework, like GAAP. So the accountant isn't required to find all issues, just to check for any material modifications needed.

Now, the problem is that the leases aren't capitalized, which is a GAAP violation. Since the issue is material, it's a significant problem. The accountant needs to decide how to report this. 

I think about the types of opinions or reports possible. For an audit, if there's a GAAP departure, the auditor might issue an adverse opinion or a disclaimer. But this is a review, so the options might be different.

In a review, if the accountant becomes aware of a material departure from GAAP, they should consider whether the financial statements are materially correct. If management refuses to correct it, the accountant should modify the report.

The standard review report typically includes an opinion that the financial statements are in accordance with GAAP. But if there's a material issue, the accountant can't give that unmodified opinion.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A: Declare that the financial statements are not in accordance with GAAP. That sounds like an adverse opinion, but in a review, do they use the same terms? I'm not sure, but I think reviews don't typically issue opinions like audits do. They might add emphasis or modify the report differently.

Option B: Issue an unmodified opinion with an emphasis of matter paragraph. No, because the issue is material, so the opinion should be modified. An unmodified opinion wouldn't address the problem adequately.

Option C: Disclose the departure from GAAP in a separate paragraph. That sounds plausible. In a review report, if there's a material departure, the accountant might add an emphasis of matter or a separate paragraph explaining the issue. Alternatively, they might withdraw from the engagement, but that's not one of the options here.

Option D: Refuse to issue a report until the leases are capitalized. I don't think that's correct. The accountant can issue a report even if there's a disagreement, but they might have to modify it. Refusing to issue isn't the right approach unless it's a severe issue, but I'm not sure.

Option E: State that the financial statements are free from material misstatement. No, because there is a material misstatement due to the leases. So this can't be correct.

Option F: Issue a disclaimer of opinion due to the departure from GAAP. Disclaimer is usually when the accountant can't form an opinion, maybe due to lack of evidence. But here, the issue is known, so a disclaimer might not fit. It's more about scope limitations.

Option G: Issue an adverse opinion because of the departure from GAAP. Adverse opinions are for when the financials are materially misstated, and the auditor has substantial doubt. But again, is this a review or an audit? In a review, I don't think they issue opinions like adverse or disclaimer. Reviews are less in scope, so maybe they don't have the same options. So this might not be the right choice.

Option H: Emphasize that the financial statements are for limited use only. I don't think that's standard. Reports don't usually state that unless for specific purposes, like when using a different framework.

Option I: Express limited assurance on the entity's financial statements. Wait, no, because the issue is that there's a material problem, so the limited assurance can't be given as usual. The accountant would have to modify the report, perhaps adding a paragraph about the departure.

Option J: Express no assurance of any kind on the entity's financial statements. That sounds like a disclaimer, but again, I'm not sure if that applies here.

Wait, let's think again. In a review engagement, when the accountant is aware of a material departure from the applicable financial reporting framework (like GAAP), what should they do? According to SSARS, the accountant should consider whether to add a paragraph to the report discussing the departure. They might also withdraw if the issue is so severe that the financial statements are misleading.

So the correct approach would be to modify the report by adding a separate paragraph that discloses the departure from GAAP. So looking back, option C says: Disclose the departure from GAAP in a separate paragraph of the accountant's report. That sounds correct.

Wait, but I'm a bit fuzzy on whether in a review, the accountant can still express limited assurance or if they have to refuse. Let me recall: In a review, if there's a material departure, the accountant should add an emphasis-of-matter paragraph, not withdraw. They would still express limited assurance but note the departure.

Alternatively, if the issue is so severe that the accountant can't even form a conclusion, they might disclaim, but that's for when they can't perform the procedures, not when there's a known GAAP issue.

So the correct answer would be to add a separate paragraph, which is option C.

In a review engagement, when the accountant identifies a material departure from GAAP, such as the failure to capitalize leases, the appropriate course of action is to modify the standard review report. Specifically, the accountant should disclose the departure from GAAP in a separate paragraph of the report. This approach aligns with the requirements of SSARS, which allow the accountant to add an emphasis-of-matter paragraph to highlight the issue while still expressing limited assurance on the financial statements. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. Declaring that the financial statements are not in accordance with GAAP is more akin to an adverse opinion, which is typically associated with audits, not reviews.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. An unmodified opinion with an emphasis-of-matter paragraph is not appropriate because the issue is material and requires a more significant modification.
- **Option C**: Correct. Disclosing the departure from GAAP in a separate paragraph is the appropriate action, as it highlights the material issue while maintaining limited assurance.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Refusing to issue a report is not necessary, as the accountant can modify the report to address the issue.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The financial statements are not free from material misstatement due to the failure to capitalize the leases.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. A disclaimer of opinion is typically used when the accountant cannot form an opinion, not when a known departure from GAAP exists.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. An adverse opinion is not issued in a review engagement; it is associated with audits.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The financial statements are not inherently for limited use only because of this issue.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. While limited assurance is expressed in a review, the report must be modified to disclose the material departure.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. Expressing no assurance is not appropriate, as the accountant can still provide limited assurance with a modified report.

Thus, the correct answer is to disclose the departure from GAAP in a separate paragraph of the accountant's report.
