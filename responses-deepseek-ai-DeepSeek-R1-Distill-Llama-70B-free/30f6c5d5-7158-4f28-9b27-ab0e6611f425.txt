Question:

What will happen to transfer earnings and economic rent if landhas only a single use?

Options:

A: The price of the land is entirely made up of transfer earnings.
B: Economic rent remains constant while transfer earnings fluctuate with market demands.

F: Transfer earnings decrease and economic rent increases.
G: Both transfer earnings and economic rent are zero.
H: Transfer earnings increase and economic rent decreases.
I: Economic rent increases to the point where it constitutes the majority, but not all, of the land price, with the remainder being transfer earnings.
J: Transfer earnings are constant, and economic rent decreases to zero.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this economics question about transfer earnings and economic rent when land has only a single use. Hmm, let's break this down step by step. 

First, I remember that transfer earnings and economic rent are concepts related to the price of land. Transfer earnings refer to the amount that the owner of a factor (like land) receives over what they would get in their next best alternative use. So, if land can be used for multiple purposes, the transfer earnings would be the extra beyond what it would earn in the alternative use.

Economic rent, on the other hand, is the excess payment beyond what is required to keep the resource in its current use. It's the income that doesn't correspond to any input's marginal productivity. For land, economic rent arises because of its scarcity and the demand for it, especially in a particular use.

Now, the question says the land has only a single use. That must mean there's no alternative use for that land. So, the next best alternative is non-existent or zero. So, transfer earnings are calculated as the current earnings minus the next best alternative. If the next best alternative is zero, then the transfer earnings would be zero because there's nothing to subtract. So, the entire price of the land would be economic rent.

Wait, let me make sure. Transfer earnings are the part that could be bid away by alternative uses. If there's only one use, then all of the earnings are due to that specific use, so there's no excess that could be transferred elsewhere. Therefore, economic rent would be the entire amount, and transfer earnings would be zero.

Looking at the options, option C says that transfer earnings are zero and the price is entirely economic rent. That matches what I was thinking. Let me check the other options to be sure.

Option A says the price is entirely transfer earnings. That can't be right because if there's no alternative, transfer earnings should be zero. Option B says economic rent is constant while transfer fluctuates, but with a single use, I don't think there's fluctuation in transfer. Option D suggests both increase proportionally, which doesn't fit. E says they vary inversely, but if one is zero, the other would be the whole, so maybe, but I think it's more about one being zero. F says transfer decreases and rent increases, but I think transfer would be zero. G says both are zero, which doesn't make sense because land has value. H says transfer increases and rent decreases, which is opposite. I says rent is majority but not all; no, if no alternative, all is rent. J says transfer is constant, but that's not the case here.

So I'm pretty confident that option C is correct.

When land has only a single use, there is no alternative use to consider, meaning transfer earnings, which represent the excess over the next best alternative, become zero. As a result, the entire price of the land is made up of economic rent, which arises from the land's scarcity and demand for its specific use.

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The price of the land is not entirely transfer earnings; transfer earnings are zero.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. Transfer earnings do not fluctuate because there are no alternatives.
- **Option C**: Correct. Transfer earnings are zero, and the price of the land is entirely economic rent.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. Both do not increase proportionally; transfer earnings are zero.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. Transfer earnings and economic rent do not vary inversely; transfer earnings are zero.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. Transfer earnings do not decrease; they are zero.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. Both are not zero; the price consists entirely of economic rent.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. Transfer earnings do not increase; they are zero.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. Economic rent is not just the majority; it constitutes the entire price.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. Transfer earnings are not constant; they are zero.

The correct answer is **C**.
