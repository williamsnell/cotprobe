Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about econometrics, specifically about OLS estimation in a simultaneous system. Hmm, I remember that simultaneous systems involve multiple equations, often where some variables are endogenous, meaning they're determined within the system. 

The question is asking what happens when we apply OLS to each equation separately. I think OLS is the ordinary least squares method, which is typically used for estimating single equations. But in a simultaneous system, like when using a system of equations (such as supply and demand), each equation might have dependent variables that are functions of each other or of other endogenous variables. 

Wait, I remember something about identification and simultaneity bias. Oh right, when there's a simultaneous system, using OLS on each equation individually can lead to biased and inconsistent estimates. Because the error terms might be correlated across equations, and the explanatory variables might be endogenous, which violates the OLS assumption that all explanatory variables are exogenous. 

So if you apply OLS to each equation separately, the estimates are biased. Also, since the bias doesn't go away as the sample size increases, the estimates are inconsistent. So that means the estimates aren't just wrong; they don't get better with more data. 

Efficiency is another concept. OLS is efficient when the errors are uncorrelated and have constant variance (homoskedastic), but in this case, because of the simultaneity, OLS isn't efficient either. But the question isn't directly asking about efficiency, but about the properties of the estimates.

Looking at the options:

A: Biased, inconsistent, inefficientâ€”this sounds right because OLS would have all these issues. But wait, wait. I think OLS is unbiased if there's no simultaneity, but with simultaneity, it's biased and inconsistent. Oh, right, the presence of simultaneity introduces bias and inconsistency. So OLS is biased and inconsistent, and also not efficient because of the correlation between equations.

But wait, the question is about applying OLS separately to each equation in a system. So for each equation, say equation 1, you have dependent variable y1 and some X's. But if some X's are endogenous, then OLS on each equation is biased and inconsistent.

So which options match that?

Option A says biased, inconsistent, inefficient. Option H says consistent but inefficient. But no, OLS in this case isn't consistent because of the simultaneity. So H is incorrect.

Option J says biased and inconsistent, but not mentioning inefficient. Wait, the question is about what the resulting estimates will be. The options are about the properties.

So the correct answer would be that the estimates are biased and inconsistent, and OLS is inefficient in this case as well. So the estimates are both biased and inconsistent, and inefficient. So looking back at the options, option A says all three: biased, inconsistent, inefficient. So that's the answer.

Wait, but I might be mixing some concepts here. Another point: when you have a system of equations, OLS applied equation by equation is called the single-equation approach. It's known to be inconsistent because of the simultaneity bias. So the estimates are biased and their variance isn't the smallest possible, making them inefficient as well.

So putting it all together, the correct choice should be option A: Biased, inconsistent, and inefficient.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. I think in some contexts, like when there's no simultaneity, OLS is unbiased and consistent. But in the case of a simultaneous system, OLS on each equation is both biased and inconsistent. So which option fits that?

Looking at the options again:

Option A: Biased, inconsistent, and inefficient.

Option J: Biased and inconsistent.

Wait, the question asks, the estimates will be... So the options are about the properties of the OLS estimates when applied to each equation in the system. So, are the estimates biased and inconsistent, and also inefficient?

I think OLS is inefficient in this context because the errors across equations may be correlated, and OLS doesn't account for that, leading to less efficient estimates. So that would make option A correct.

Alternatively, maybe the inefficiency refers to not achieving the Cramer-Rao lower bound, which would be the case here. So yes, option A.
</think>

When applying OLS to each equation in a simultaneous system, the estimates are problematic due to the nature of the system. Simultaneous systems often involve endogenous variables, where some explanatory variables are determined within the system. This leads to simultaneity bias because the error terms across equations may be correlated, and the explanatory variables may not be strictly exogenous. As a result, OLS estimates become biased and inconsistent, as the bias does not diminish with larger sample sizes.

Additionally, OLS is inefficient in this context because it does not account for the correlation between error terms across equations, leading to less precise estimates. Therefore, the estimates are not only biased and inconsistent but also inefficient.

Among the options provided:

- **Option A**: Biased, inconsistent, and inefficient. This correctly describes the properties of OLS estimates when applied to each equation in a simultaneous system.
- **Option J**: Biased and inconsistent. While this is partially correct, it does not account for the inefficiency of the estimates.

Thus, the correct answer is **Option A**, as it fully captures the issues with OLS in this context.
