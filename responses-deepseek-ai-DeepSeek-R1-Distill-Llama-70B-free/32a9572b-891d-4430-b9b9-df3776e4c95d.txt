Okay, so I've got this logic problem here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about translating an English sentence into predicate logic. The sentence given is: "Leroy is bad only if DJ Khaled shouts his name." Hmm, I remember that "only if" can be a bit tricky in logic. Let me think about what that means.

First, I need to parse the sentence. The structure is "A is bad only if B." From what I recall, "A only if B" translates to B → A in logic. Wait, no, actually, I think it's the other way around. Because "only if" can be a bit confusing. Let me make sure.

In logic, "P only if Q" is the same as Q → P. Because if Q doesn't hold, then P can't hold. So, the original statement is "Leroy is bad only if DJ Khaled shouts his name." Let me assign some variables to make it clearer.

Let me define:
- Let L(x) represent "x is Leroy." But wait, in predicate logic, we usually have predicates with variables. Alternatively, maybe we can treat Leroy as a constant, but the options here have predicates with variables, like Bx, Sy, etc. So perhaps the predicates are defined differently.

Wait, looking at the options, I see things like Bl, Sy, Bx, etc. Maybe each letter represents a predicate. Let me try to figure out what each predicate stands for.

Looking at the options:

A: Sy ≡ Bl
B: Sy ⊃ Bl
C: Bx ⊃ Sy
D: Bl ⊃ Sk
E: Bx ≡ Sy
F: Sk ⊃ By
G: Sk ⊃ Bx
H: Sk ≡ Bl
I: By ≡ Sk
J: Bl ≡ Sk

Hmm, so each of these is a statement involving predicates. Let's assume that:

- Bl means "Leroy is bad." Or wait, maybe Bx is "x is bad." Similarly, Sy could be "DJ Khaled shouts y's name," or maybe it's "DJ Khaled shouts x's name." Wait, but the original statement is about Leroy and DJ Khaled.

Wait, perhaps the predicates are defined as:

- B(x): x is bad.

- S(x): DJ Khaled shouts x's name.

So, Leroy is a specific individual, perhaps represented by a constant, say l. So "Leroy is bad" would be B(l). "DJ Khaled shouts Leroy's name" would be S(l).

But the original statement is "Leroy is bad only if DJ Khaled shouts his name." So in logic, as I thought earlier, "A only if B" translates to B → A, or A → B? Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Wait, no. Let me think again. "A only if B" means that for A to be true, B must be true. So if A is true, then B must be true. That would be A → B. But wait, no. Because "only if" is a necessary condition. So "A only if B" means that B is a necessary condition for A. So A can only be true if B is true. So the logical form is A → B. Because if A is true, B must be true.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure. Let me think of an example. Suppose I say, "I will go to the party only if I finish my work." That means if I go to the party (A), then I have finished my work (B). So A → B.

So applying that to the problem, "Leroy is bad only if DJ Khaled shouts his name." So if Leroy is bad (A), then DJ Khaled shouts his name (B). So A → B.

Now, translating that into the predicates. Let me clarify:

A is "Leroy is bad," which would be B(l), assuming l is Leroy.

B is "DJ Khaled shouts Leroy's name," which would be S(l).

So the statement is B(l) → S(l).

But looking at the options, I don't see any that directly match this. The options all have variables, like Bx, Sy, etc., without constants. So perhaps the problem is using variables, and Leroy is represented by x.

Wait, perhaps the translation is more general. Let me think again. The original statement is about Leroy specifically, but the options use variables, so maybe it's a universal statement. But the question is about translating the specific statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are using different predicates. Let me try to map this.

Wait, perhaps Bl represents "Leroy is bad," and Sy represents "DJ Khaled shouts Leroy's name." But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe Bl is a predicate where l is the subject. Hmm, but the options are written as, for example, B: Sy ⊃ Bl.

Wait, perhaps each option is a statement, and we need to pick the correct implication.

Wait, the original statement is "Leroy is bad only if DJ Khaled shouts his name." So in logic, that's B(l) → S(l). So looking for an option that says Bl implies something. But the options don't have l as the subject. Wait, perhaps Bl is "Leroy is bad," and Sy is "DJ Khaled shouts his name." So the implication would be Bl → Sy. But looking at the options, option B is Sy ⊃ Bl, which is the converse. Option D is Bl ⊃ Sk. Wait, Sk? That's a different predicate. Maybe Sk is "DJ Khaled shouts someone's name." Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me try to parse the sentence again. The sentence is "Leroy is bad only if DJ Khaled shouts his name." So in logical terms, that's "If Leroy is bad, then DJ Khaled shouts his name." So B(l) → S(l).

Looking at the options, none of them directly match B(l) → S(l). But perhaps the options are using a different notation. Let me check the options again.

Option B: Sy ⊃ Bl. That would mean "If DJ Khaled shouts his name, then Leroy is bad." Wait, that's the opposite of what we need. So that's not correct.

Option D: Bl ⊃ Sk. So Bl is "Leroy is bad," and Sk is "DJ Khaled shouts k's name." Wait, but that would be more like "If Leroy is bad, then DJ Khaled shouts k's name." But k is a variable here, so that might not be correct unless k refers to Leroy. Hmm, maybe not.

Wait, perhaps the correct translation is Bl → Sy, where Bl is "Leroy is bad" and Sy is "DJ Khaled shouts Yeroy's name." But I don't see that option. Let me check the options again.

Wait, looking at the options, I see option B is Sy → Bl, which is the opposite. Option D is Bl → Sk. Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is Bl → Sy, but that's not present.

Wait, maybe the options are using different letters. Let me think: Maybe Bl represents "Leroy is bad," and Sy represents "DJ Khaled shouts his name." So the correct implication would be Bl → Sy. But none of the options seem to have that.

Wait, looking again, option B is Sy → Bl. That would mean "If DJ Khaled shouts his name, then Leroy is bad," which is the converse of what we want.

Option D is Bl → Sk. If Sk is "DJ Khaled shouts someone's name," then Bl → Sk would mean "If Leroy is bad, then DJ Khaled shouts someone's name." But the original statement is more specific; it's about shouting Leroy's name. So that might not be exact, but perhaps that's the closest we have.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D: Bl ⊃ Sk.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think again about the original statement. "Leroy is bad only if DJ Khaled shouts his name." So the structure is A only if B, which translates to B → A. Wait, wait, no, earlier I thought it was A → B. Wait, I'm getting confused again.

Wait, let me clarify. In logic, "A only if B" is equivalent to "If A then B," which is A → B. So if Leroy is bad (A), then DJ Khaled shouts his name (B). So A → B is Bl → Sy, assuming Sy is "DJ Khaled shouts his name."

But looking at the options, I don't see Bl → Sy. Let me check the options again.

Option B is Sy → Bl, which is B → A. That's the converse, so that's not correct.

Option D is Bl → Sk. So if Bl is "Leroy is bad," Sk might be "DJ Khaled shouts k's name." But in the original statement, it's specifically Leroy's name, so Sk would need to be about Leroy. Unless Sk is a general statement, but that might not be precise.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct option is D: Bl ⊃ Sk, assuming that Sk represents "DJ Khaled shouts Leroy's name." But I'm not certain about the notation.

Wait, maybe I'm misinterpreting the predicates. Let me consider the variables. Maybe x is Leroy. So Bx would be "x is bad," and Sy would be "DJ Khaled shouts y's name." Hmm, but that complicates things.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B: Sy → Bl. But that would mean "If DJ Khaled shouts his name, then Leroy is bad," which is the converse of what we need.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me try to approach it differently. The original statement is "Leroy is bad only if DJ Khaled shouts his name." So the only way Leroy can be bad is if DJ Khaled shouts his name. So being bad implies that the shouting happened. So B(l) → S(l).

Looking at the options, the correct implication would be Bl → Sy, but I don't see that option. So perhaps the closest is option D, Bl → Sk. But I'm not sure if Sk is the right predicate.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is option B: Sy → Bl, but that's the opposite. I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I should look up the standard translation of "only if." According to logic, "P only if Q" is P → Q. So in this case, P is "Leroy is bad," and Q is "DJ Khaled shouts his name." So P → Q, which is Bl → Sy.

But none of the options have Bl → Sy. Wait, looking again, option B is Sy → Bl. That's the opposite. So perhaps the correct option isn't present, but that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assigning the predicates. Maybe Bl is "DJ Khaled shouts his name," and Sy is "Leroy is bad." That would change things. Let me check the options again.

If Bl is "DJ Khaled shouts his name," and Sy is "Leroy is bad," then the original statement "Leroy is bad only if DJ Khaled shouts his name" would be Sy → Bl, which is option B. So option B would be correct.

Wait, but that would mean that Bl is "DJ Khaled shouts his name," and Sy is "Leroy is bad." So the implication would be Sy → Bl, which is option B.

Hmm, that makes sense. So the correct answer would be option B: Sy ⊃ Bl.

Wait, but earlier I thought that "A only if B" translates to A → B. So if A is "Leroy is bad" (Sy) and B is "DJ Khaled shouts his name" (Bl), then it's Sy → Bl, which is option B.

Yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer is option B.

The question requires translating the English sentence "Leroy is bad only if DJ Khaled shouts his name" into predicate logic. To analyze this, we first recognize that "A only if B" is logically equivalent to "If A, then B" (A → B). Here, "A" corresponds to "Leroy is bad," and "B" corresponds to "DJ Khaled shouts his name."

To represent this in predicate logic, we need to assign predicates to the components of the sentence. Let us assume:
- **Bl**: "Leroy is bad."
- **Sy**: "DJ Khaled shouts his name."

The logical translation of "Leroy is bad only if DJ Khaled shouts his name" is therefore **Bl → Sy**.

Now, examining the options:
- **Option A**: Sy ≡ Bl (equivalence, not implication; incorrect).
- **Option B**: Sy ⊃ Bl (converse of the required implication; incorrect).
- **Option C**: Bx ⊃ Sy (introduces a variable x, which is unnecessary; incorrect).
- **Option D**: Bl ⊃ Sk (introduces Sk, which is undefined in this context; incorrect).
- **Option E**: Bx ≡ Sy (equivalence with an unnecessary variable; incorrect).
- **Option F**: Sk ⊃ By (introduces undefined predicates; incorrect).
- **Option G**: Sk ⊃ Bx (introduces undefined predicates; incorrect).
- **Option H**: Sk ≡ Bl (equivalence with undefined predicates; incorrect).
- **Option I**: By ≡ Sk (equivalence with undefined predicates; incorrect).
- **Option J**: Bl ≡ Sk (equivalence with undefined predicates; incorrect).

None of the options directly match **Bl → Sy**, but **Option B (Sy ⊃ Bl)** represents the converse of the required implication. Since this is the closest available option, it is selected as the answer.

Answer: B
