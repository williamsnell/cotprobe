Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about comparative and absolute advantage. Hmm, I remember that absolute advantage is when a country can produce a good more efficiently than another, while comparative advantage is about the opportunity cost of producing goods. Let me think this through.

The question is asking which statement is NOT correct. The options are A through D.

Option A says, "One can have comparative advantage in producing both goods." Wait, no, I think that's not possible. Because for two goods, each country will have a comparative advantage in one, right? Like, if Country A has a lower opportunity cost in producing x, Country B must have it in y. So you can't have a comparative advantage in both. So A is incorrect, meaning the statement is wrong, so the answer might be A.

Option B: "One can have both an absolute advantage and a comparative advantage in producing x." I think that's possible. Like if a country is better at making x than another in absolute terms, and also has a lower opportunity cost, then yes, they can have both. So B is correct.

Option C: "One can have absolute advantage and no comparative advantage in producing x." Oh yeah, that makes sense. Imagine a country that's really good at making x, but even better at making y. So their absolute advantage is in x, but their comparative advantage would be in y. So yes, C is correct.

Option D: "One can have comparative advantage and no absolute advantage in producing x." That's definitely possible. Like, a country might not be the best at making x, but because their opportunity cost is lower, they have a comparative advantage. So D is correct.

So the incorrect statement is A because you can't have a comparative advantage in both goods. So the answer should be A.

The incorrect statement is A because a country cannot have a comparative advantage in producing both goods when there are only two goods. 

Answer: A
