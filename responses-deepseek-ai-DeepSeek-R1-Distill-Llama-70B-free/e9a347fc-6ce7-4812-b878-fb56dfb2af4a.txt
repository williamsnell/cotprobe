Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the minimum escape speed from Earth for a spacecraft. Hmm, escape velocity, right? I remember that the escape velocity is the speed needed to break free from a planet's gravitational pull without further propulsion. But wait, the question says the spacecraft is in orbit 200 km above Earth in a circular orbit. Oh, so it's asking for the escape speed from that specific point, not from the Earth's surface.

Wait, no. Wait, the escape velocity is usually calculated from the surface, but if the spacecraft is already in orbit, maybe the question is a bit different. Or maybe it's just asking for the escape velocity from Earth, regardless of current position. I'm a bit confused. Let me think.

The formula for escape velocity is v_escape = sqrt(2 * G * M / r), where G is the gravitational constant, M is Earth's mass, and r is the distance from the center of the Earth. But wait, if the spacecraft is in orbit, maybe the escape velocity from that orbit is different? Or is the question just using that as a setup and actually asking for Earth's escape velocity in general?

Wait, the question says "calculate the minimum escape speed from Earth." So regardless of where the spacecraft is, the escape velocity from Earth's surface is usually about 11.2 km/s. But the options don't have anything near that. The highest option is 6.42 km/s. So maybe the question is about the escape velocity from the spacecraft's current location, which is 200 km above Earth.

Oh, right! Because escape velocity depends on the distance from the center of the mass. So if the spacecraft is at a higher altitude, the escape velocity would be lower than 11.2 km/s.

Right, so first I need to find the escape velocity at that altitude. Let's break this down.

First, Earth's radius is about 6,371 km. So the distance from the center, r, is 6371 km + 200 km = 6571 km, which is 6,571,000 meters.

Wait, but wait a second. Alternatively, maybe the question is actually asking for the escape velocity from Earth, but considering that the spacecraft is already in orbit. No, I think I should proceed with the escape velocity at that altitude.

Wait, the escape velocity formula is sqrt(2 * G * M / r). Alternatively, another approach is to think about the kinetic and potential energy. The escape velocity is when the kinetic energy equals the gravitational potential energy (with a factor because potential energy is negative). So (1/2)mv² = G*M*m / r. Oh wait, no, the potential energy is -G*M*m/r, so when the kinetic equals the magnitude, you get (1/2)mv² = G*M*m/r. So v = sqrt(2 G M / r).

Yes, that's correct.

So I need to compute that. Let's plug in the numbers.

But wait, what is the value of G and M? G is 6.674×10^-11 N·m²/kg². M for Earth is about 5.972×10^24 kg.

So let me compute 2 * G * M / r.

But wait, r is 6,571,000 meters.

Wait, but perhaps there's a simpler way. I remember that at the Earth's surface, the escape velocity is about 11.2 km/s. Since escape velocity varies with the square root of (1/r), perhaps I can find the ratio.

Wait, but the formula is v = sqrt(2GM/r). So if I calculate it for r = 6,371 km, I get 11.2 km/s. For r = 6,571 km, that's a bit larger, so the escape velocity would be a bit lower.

So let me compute the ratio. Let me compute (r_new / r_surface) = (6571 km) / (6371 km) ≈ 1.0313. So the square root of (1/1.0313) ≈ sqrt(0.97) ≈ 0.985. So v_escape_new ≈ 11.2 km/s * 0.985 ≈ around 11.03 km/s? Wait, that doesn't make sense because the options are way lower. Wait, perhaps I'm getting something wrong here.

Wait no, that approach is wrong because the escape velocity from the surface is 11.2 km/s, but the escape velocity from a higher orbit is lower. Wait, but the options given are much lower than that. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in considering the correct formula.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing escape velocity with orbital velocity. Because the spacecraft is in a circular orbit, so its current speed is the orbital velocity. The escape velocity is higher than that. Because to escape, you need to have more speed.

Wait, the orbital velocity v_orb is sqrt(G*M/r). So the escape velocity is sqrt(2) times that. So v_escape = sqrt(2) * v_orb.

So if the spacecraft is in orbit, its current speed is v_orb, and to escape, it needs an additional delta-v of (sqrt(2)-1) * v_orb. Or perhaps the question is asking for the escape velocity from that point, which would be sqrt(2) * v_orb.

Wait, but the question says "minimum escape speed from Earth." So perhaps it's asking about the escape velocity from Earth, regardless of the current position. But the presence of the spacecraft in orbit might be a red herring.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is actually about the escape velocity at that altitude, which would be lower than 11.2 km/s.

Let me calculate it properly.

Compute v_escape at r = 6,571 km.

So r = 6,571,000 meters.

Compute 2 * G * M / r.

G = 6.674e-11 m³/(kg s²)
M = 5.972e24 kg

2*G*M = 2 * 6.674e-11 * 5.972e24.

Calculate that:

6.674e-11 * 5.972e24 = approx 6.674 *5.972 = approx 40 (6*6=36, 0.674*5.972~4.02, so total 40.02) but in exponents: 1e-11 *1e24 = 1e13. So 40e13 = 4e14.

Wait, let me compute more accurately:

6.674e-11 *5.972e24 = 6.674 *5.972 = let's compute:

6 *5.972=35.832
0.674 *5.972≈4.023
Total ≈35.832 +4.023≈39.855
Multiply by 1e-11 *1e24 → 1e13.

So 39.855e13 → 3.9855e14 m³/s².

Multiply by 2: 2 * 3.9855e14 =7.971e14 m³/s².

Then divide by r: 6,571e3 meters.

So 7.971e14 / 6.571e6 = approx (7.971 /6.571) * 1e8.

Compute 7.971 /6.571 → approximately 1.212.

So 1.212e8 m²/s².

Then take sqrt of that: sqrt(1.212e8) m/s.

What's sqrt(1.212e8)? So sqrt(1.212) is approx 1.1, and sqrt(1e8)=1e4=10,000. So 1.1e4 m/s = 11,000 m/s, which is 11.0 km/s.

Wait, that's the same as the escape velocity from Earth's surface. That can't be right because we're at a higher altitude. So I must have made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps.

Wait, 2GM is 2*6.674e-11 *5.972e24 = let me compute that again.

6.674e-11 *5.972e24 = 6.674 *5.972 = ~39.85 as before. So 39.85e13 (since 1e-11 *1e24=1e13). Multiply by 2 gives 79.7e13 = 7.97e14.

Then, 7.97e14 divided by 6,571e3 meters. So 6,571,000 meters is 6.571e6 meters.

So 7.97e14 /6.571e6 = (7.97/6.571) *1e8.

Compute 7.97 ÷6.571 → approximately 1.212.

So 1.212e8 m²/s² → 1.212e8 = 121,200,000.

Now take the square root of that. Let's compute sqrt(121,200,000).

Well, sqrt(1.212e8) = sqrt(1.212)*1e4.

sqrt(1.212) is approximately 1.1 (since 1.1^2 =1.21), so 1.1 *1e4 =11,000 m/s, which is 11 km/s.

Wait, that's the same as Earth's surface. That can't be right. Because when you're further away from Earth, the escape velocity should be lower.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the value of r. Oh wait! Because 200 km above Earth's surface, but Earth's radius is about 6,371 km. So 6371 +200 =6571 km, which is 6,571,000 meters. So the calculation was correct.

Hmm, but that gives the same escape velocity as from Earth's surface. That can't be. Because when you're farther from Earth, the escape velocity decreases. So what's wrong here?

Wait a second, perhaps I should double-check the formula. Oh wait, the escape velocity formula is sqrt(2 G M / r), yes. So if r increases, the escape velocity decreases. So why is it coming out the same?

Wait, perhaps because the Earth's mass includes its radius. Wait, no. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of 2GM divided by r.

Wait another approach: compute the escape velocity at Earth's surface and then adjust for the increased r.

At Earth's surface, escape velocity v0 = 11.2 km/s. Now, when you go up by 200 km, the new r is R = 6371 + 200 =6571 km.

So v_escape_new = v0 * sqrt(R_surface / R_new).

Because v_escape is proportional to sqrt(1/r). So v_escape_new = 11.2 * sqrt(6371/6571).

Compute 6371 /6571 ≈ 0.9695. The square root of that is about 0.9847.

So v_escape_new ≈ 11.2 * 0.9847 ≈ 11.03 km/s.

But that's still around 11 km/s, which doesn't match the answer options. The options go up to 6.42 km/s.

Wait, this is confusing. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me re-read the question.

Question: A spacecraft is placed in orbit 200 km above Earth in a circular orbit. Calculate the minimum escape speed from Earth.

Wait, perhaps the question is not asking for the escape velocity from Earth, but the escape velocity from the orbit. Or perhaps it's a trick question. Because when you're already in orbit, the escape velocity from Earth would be the same as from the surface, but perhaps that's not correct.

Wait, no. The escape velocity depends on your distance from the center of the Earth. So from a higher orbit, the escape velocity is lower than from the surface. So the calculation I did earlier should give a slightly lower value than 11.2 km/s, but still around 11 km/s, which is not an option.

Wait, but the options are all lower, like 6 km/s. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach.

Wait another thought: perhaps the question is asking about the speed needed to escape from the Earth's gravitational pull as viewed from the spacecraft's position, but considering that the spacecraft is already moving in orbit. Hmm, no, escape velocity is a function of position, not of the object's current speed.

Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the escape velocity from Earth, but considering that the spacecraft is in a low Earth orbit, but perhaps I'm supposed to compute it differently.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually about the escape velocity from Earth, but using the radius including the 200 km altitude.

Wait, but earlier calculation gives about 11 km/s, which is not among the options. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually referring to the orbital speed, not the escape speed. Because the orbital speed at 200 km altitude is in the ballpark of the options given.

Wait, let me think. The orbital speed v_orb is sqrt(G M / r).

For Earth's surface, r=6.371e6 m. So v_orb_surface = sqrt( (6.67e-11 *5.97e24) /6.37e6 ). Let me compute that roughly.

6.67e-11 *5.97e24 = approx 3.986e14 m³/s².

Divide by 6.37e6 m: 3.986e14 /6.37e6 ≈6.26e7 m²/s².

Square root is sqrt(6.26e7) ≈7.92e3 m/s =7.92 km/s, which is the orbital speed at Earth's surface, which is correct.

At 200 km altitude, r=6,571,000 m.

So GM=3.986e14 m³/s².

v_orb = sqrt(3.986e14 /6.571e6) = sqrt(6.066e7) ≈7.79 km/s.

So about 7.79 km/s.

But the question is about escape speed, which is sqrt(2) times that, so sqrt(2)*7.79≈11.0 km/s again.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that the escape velocity from the Earth is independent of the position, which is not correct, but perhaps the question is simply asking for the standard escape velocity from Earth's surface, but the options don't include that.

Wait, looking at the options: A is 6.42 km/s. That's close to sqrt( (G M ) / (r) ) at 200 km, but that's the orbital speed, not escape. So 7.79 km/s is the orbital speed, but the escape is higher.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is about the escape velocity from the solar system, but that's another matter.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of r. Wait, 200 km above Earth's surface. So Earth's average radius is about 6,371 km, so total r is 6,371 +200=6,571 km. Wait, but 6,571 kilometers is 6,571,000 meters.

Wait, perhaps I should recalculate the escape velocity correctly.

v_escape = sqrt( (2 * G * M) / r )

Plugging in the numbers:

G =6.674e-11 m³/(kg s²)
M=5.972e24 kg
r=6,571,000 m

Compute numerator: 2 *6.674e-11 *5.972e24

6.674e-11 *5.972e24 = let's compute 6.674 *5.972.

6 *5.972=35.832
0.674 *5.972≈4.023
Total≈35.832 +4.023=39.855.

So 39.855e13 (since 1e-11 *1e24=1e13)

Multiply by 2: 79.71e13 =7.971e14.

Denominator:6,571,000 m=6.571e6 m.

So 7.971e14 /6.571e6 = (7.971 /6.571 ) *1e8.

Compute 7.971 ÷6.571:

6.571 *1.2=7.8852 → which is close to 7.971. So 1.2 approximately.

So 1.2 *1e8 =1.2e8 m²/s².

Take square root: sqrt(1.2e8)=sqrt(1.2)*1e4= approx 1.0954 *1e4=10,954 m/s=10.95 km/s.

Hmm, so about 10.95 km/s, which is close to the standard 11.2 km/s, but a bit lower, as expected. But none of the options are near that.

Wait, but the options don't go that high. The highest option is A:6.42 km/s. So I must have misunderstood the question.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the escape velocity from the Moon? No, the question says from Earth.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the question is actually asking about the escape velocity from Earth's gravitational influence, which would be the same as from Earth's surface. But that doesn't make sense because the options don't include it.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the escape velocity from the Earth-Moon system or something else. No, the question is clear.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the speed needed to escape from Earth's gravity into the solar system, which is the same as Earth's escape velocity regardless of altitude, but that doesn't change with altitude.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Let me think again.

Wait, the formula for escape velocity is v = sqrt(2 G M / r). So when you're at a higher altitude, r is bigger, so v is smaller. So for r=6,571 km, v should be lower than 11.2 km/s, but my earlier calculation gives about 10.95 km/s, which is still higher than any option.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the speed relative to the spacecraft, which is already in orbit. No, escape velocity is a property of the location, not relative to a moving frame.

Wait, perhaps the question is actually about the speed needed to escape Earth from that orbit, but considering that the spacecraft is moving in the opposite direction. No, that doesn't make sense because escape velocity is the minimum speed needed regardless of direction.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the escape velocity from the solar system at that point, but that's more complicated and not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm miscalculating the value of r. Let me recheck.

Wait, 200 km above Earth's surface: Earth's radius is about 6371 km, so r=6371 +200=
