Okay, so I need to figure out which schedule of reinforcement applies to Soledad answering every email her friend sends. Hmm, let's think about what each of these terms means.

I remember that schedules of reinforcement are about how often a behavior is reinforced. There are a few main types like continuous, fixed ratio, variable ratio, fixed interval, and variable interval. Oh, and then there's stuff like positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, extinction, punishment, etc. But wait, the question is specifically about the schedule, so maybe I should focus on those.

So Soledad answers every email. That means every time her friend sends an email, she gets a response. So every response is reinforced immediately. In operant conditioning terms, when a behavior is reinforced every time it occurs, that's a continuous reinforcement schedule. 

Wait, but what's the difference between continuous and other schedules? Continuous reinforcement is when every instance of the behavior is followed by a reinforcement. Like, if you press a lever and every time you get a reward, that's continuous. On the other hand, fixed ratio is when you get a reward after a certain number of responses, like every fifth email or something. Variable ratio is unpredictable, like gambling where you don't know when the next reward is coming.

So in this case, since Soledad answers every email, it's continuous. So the schedule is continuous reinforcement. Looking at the options, option B is continuous. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but wait. The question mentions that she answers every email her friend sends. So the friend's sending is the behavior, and Soledad's response is the reinforcement? Or is it the other way around? Hmm, maybe I need to clarify. Wait, in this context, Soledad is the one performing the behaviorâ€”answering the emails. Every time she does that, she probably gets some kind of positive response, like a reply or a thank you. So her action (answering) is being reinforced every time. Therefore, it's a continuous schedule because every response is reinforced.

Alternatively, maybe the friend is the one sending emails and Soledad is reinforcing that by replying each time. But the question says Soledad is the one answering. So the reinforcement is for her action of answering. So yes, every time she answers, she gets something positive (like a response), making it continuous.

So the correct answer is B: continuous.

The question asks which schedule of reinforcement applies to Soledad, who answers every email her friend sends. To determine this, we analyze the scenario: every time Soledad answers an email, she receives a response, which acts as a reinforcement. This pattern aligns with continuous reinforcement, where every instance of the behavior (answering an email) is immediately followed by a reinforcement (receiving a reply). 

Other schedules, such as fixed ratio or variable ratio, involve reinforcement after a set number of responses or at unpredictable intervals, respectively. Since Soledad's behavior is reinforced every time, the correct schedule is continuous reinforcement.

Answer: B
