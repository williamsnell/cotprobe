Okay, so I've got this statistics problem here about rainfall distribution. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The problem says that the rainfall per month in a certain city follows a normal distribution. The mean is six inches, and the standard deviation is 1.6 inches. The question is asking for the highest amount of rainfall that would still place this month among the 10% driest months. 

Hmm, right. So, in a normal distribution, data is symmetric around the mean. The driest months would be on the lower end of the distribution. Since it's the 10% driest, I think that means we're looking for the value where 10% of the data is below it, and 90% is above. So that value would be the 10th percentile.

Wait, wait. Let me make sure. The 10th percentile is the value where 10% of the data is less than or equal to that value. So yes, if we're looking for the cutoff for the 10% driest, that would be the 10th percentile. 

So the formula to find the percentile in a normal distribution is z = (X - μ) / σ, but wait, actually, I think I need to reverse that. Because I have the percentile and need to find X. So first, I find the z-score corresponding to the 10th percentile, then plug into X = μ + z*σ.

Right. So the z-score for the 10th percentile is needed. I remember that the z-table gives the area to the left of the z-score. So for 10%, the area is 0.10. 

I think the z-score for 10% is around -1.28. Let me think. Oh wait, I'm pretty sure the z-score for 10% is approximately -1.28. Yeah, because for 90%, the z is about 1.28, so the 10th is the negative of that.

So plugging into the formula: X = μ + z*σ. The mean μ is 6 inches, and σ is 1.6 inches. So X = 6 + (-1.28)(1.6).

Calculating that: -1.28 * 1.6. Let's see. 1.28 * 1.6. 1 times 1.6 is 1.6, 0.28*1.6 is 0.448. So total is 2.048. So with the negative, it's -2.048. 

So X is 6 - 2.048 = 3.952 inches. Wait, but looking at the options, let's see. Option D is 3.37, H is 3.95. So 3.952 is approximately 3.95, which matches option H.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps. Did I get the right percentile? The 10% driest would be the 10th percentile, which is the lower end. So yeah, z is negative, which makes sense.

Alternatively, maybe I should use a more precise z-value. Let me think about the exact value. The 10th percentile's z-score is the value where P(Z <= z) = 0.10. Looking it up, the exact z-score is approximately -1.28155. So using that would give a more precise value.

Calculating X again: -1.28155 * 1.6 = approximately -2.053. So X = 6 - 2.053 = 3.947 inches. Which is about 3.95. So still, option H is 3.95, which would be the correct answer.

Looking at the options, H is 3.95. So that must be the right choice.

The problem involves determining the highest amount of rainfall that would place the month among the 10% driest months in a city where rainfall is normally distributed with a mean of 6 inches and a standard deviation of 1.6 inches. This corresponds to finding the 10th percentile of the distribution.

To solve this, the z-score for the 10th percentile is needed. The z-score is approximately -1.28 (or more precisely, -1.28155). Using the formula for the percentile in a normal distribution:

\[
X = \mu + z \cdot \sigma
\]

where \( \mu = 6 \), \( \sigma = 1.6 \), and \( z = -1.28 \), the calculation becomes:

\[
X = 6 + (-1.28)(1.6) = 6 - 2.048 = 3.952 \, \text{inches}.
\]

This value rounds to approximately 3.95 inches. Among the given options, the closest match is **3.95 inches**, which corresponds to option H.

Answer: H
