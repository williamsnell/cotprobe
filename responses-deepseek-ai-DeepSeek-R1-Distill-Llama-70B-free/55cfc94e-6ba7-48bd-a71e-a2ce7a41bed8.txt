Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I need to figure out which set of integers is arranged from least to greatest. Hmm, let's see. The options are labeled A through J, and each option has a sequence of five integers. My goal is to check each option and see which one is correctly ordered from the smallest number to the largest.

Wait, what does least to greatest mean again? Oh right, it's arranging numbers starting from the smallest (most negative or lowest positive) to the largest positive. So I need to look at each option and see if the numbers are in that order.

Let me go through each option one by one. Maybe I'll list the numbers in each and then sort them mentally to see if they match the order given.

Starting with option A: 11, −9, 7, −6, −3. Let's see, the numbers here are 11, -9, 7, -6, -3. The smallest should be -9, then -6, then -3, then 7, and largest 11. But the sequence here starts with 11, which is the largest. So this isn't correct. So A is out.

Option B: 7, 11, −6, −3, −9. Let's list them: 7, 11, -6, -3, -9. Wait, the order here starts positive, then jumps to -6, which is smaller than 7. But the correct order should go from negative to positive. So this seems mixed up. The numbers are 7, 11, then negatives. That doesn't make sense because the negatives are smaller than positives. So B is incorrect.

Option C: −3, 7, −9, −6, 11. Let's see: -3, 7, -9, -6, 11. Hmm, starting with -3, which is correct, but then it goes to 7. Wait, but after -3, the next number should be the next larger negative, which would be -6 and -9. Wait, actually, no. Wait, negatives are smaller than positives. So after the negatives come the positives. So the order should be: first the negatives in order from smallest to largest (like -9, -6, -3), then the positives in order (7, 11). So looking at C: -3 is first, which is bigger than -6 and -9. So that's not correct. So C is wrong.

Option D: −6, −3, 7, 11, −9. Let's break it down: -6, -3, 7, 11, -9. Wait, after 11 comes -9, which is smaller than 11. So the order breaks there. The last number should be the largest, which is 11, but here it's followed by -9, which is way smaller. So D is incorrect.

Option E: −9, −3, 7, 11, −6. The numbers are -9, -3, 7, 11, -6. Wait, after 11 comes -6, which is smaller. So the order isn't maintained. So E is wrong.

Option F: −3, −6, 7, 11, –9. Wait, the numbers are -3, -6, 7, 11, -9. Wait, -3 comes before -6, but -6 is smaller than -3, so that's incorrect. The negatives should be ordered from smallest to largest, which would be -6, then -3. So F starts with -3, which is larger than -6, so F is wrong.

Option G: −9, 7, −6, −3, 11. So the sequence is -9 (good, smallest), then 7. Wait, but there are more negatives after that. So after -9, the next should be the next smallest, which is -6, then -3, then 7, then 11. But G has after -9, it's 7, which skips the other negatives. So that's not correct. G is incorrect.

Option H: −9, −6, −3, 7, 11. Let's see: starts with -9, which is the smallest. Next is -6, which is larger than -9. Then -3, which is larger than -6. Then 7, which is positive and larger than -3. Then 11, which is larger than 7. So this looks correct. Each number is larger than the previous, so H is in order from least to greatest.

Wait, but I should check the remaining options just to be sure, in case I made a mistake.

Option I: 11, 7, −3, −6, −9. So starts with 11 (largest), then 7 (smaller), then -3, then -6, then -9. So this is in descending order, not ascending. So I is wrong.

Option J: 7, −9, −6, −3, 11. The sequence is 7, then -9 (which is smaller), then -6 (which is larger than -9), then -3 (larger than -6), then 11 (larger than -3). Wait, but the first number is 7, which is positive, but there are negatives after that, which are smaller. So the order is incorrect because it starts with a positive then goes to a smaller negative. So J is wrong.

So the only option that correctly orders the integers from least to greatest is option H: −9, −6, −3, 7, 11.

The correct answer is option H, as it is the only sequence where the integers are arranged in ascending order from least to greatest.
