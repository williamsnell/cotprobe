Answer:
    <think>

Okay, so I've got this equation to solve: 6x² -7x -20 = 0. Hmm, quadratic equations. I remember there are a few methods to solve them, like factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. Let me think about which one would work best here.

First, I'll check if I can factor it easily. The standard form is ax² + bx + c = 0. So here, a is 6, b is -7, and c is -20. To factor it, I'm looking for two numbers that multiply to a*c, which is 6*(-20) = -120. And those two numbers should add up to b, which is -7.

Wait, let's see. So I need two numbers that multiply to -120 and add to -7. Hmm. Let's think: 15 and -8? 15*(-8) is -120, and 15 + (-8) is 7. Oh wait, but I need them to add up to -7. So maybe -15 and 8? Because -15 +8 is -7. Yeah, that works.

So these numbers are -15 and 8. Now I can split the middle term using these. So the equation becomes:

6x² -15x +8x -20 = 0.

Now I can group the first two and last two terms:

(6x² -15x) + (8x -20) = 0.

Factor out the common factors in each group. From the first group, 3x is common:

3x(2x -5) +4(2x -5) = 0.

Wait, 8x-20, factoring 4 gives 4(2x-5). Right. So both groups have (2x -5) as a factor. So factor that out:

(2x -5)(3x +4) = 0.

So setting each factor equal to zero:

2x -5 =0 → 2x=5 → x=5/2.

3x +4=0 →3x=-4 →x= -4/3.

So the solutions are x=5/2 and x= -4/3.

Now looking at the options provided. Let me check each option:

Option A: 5/2, 4/3 → No, because one is positive 4/3, but I have negative.

Option B: -5/3, 4/2 → 4/2 is 2, but our solutions are 5/2 and -4/3.

Option C:5/3, -4/2 → -4/2 is -2, not matching.

Option D: 2, -10 → No, those aren't the solutions.

Option E:4, -5 → Nope.

Option F:-5/2,4/3 → No, signs are opposite for one.

Option G:-5/6,4/5→ No.

Option H:5/2, -4/3 → Yes, this matches our solutions.

Option I:5,4→ No.

Option J:5, -4→ No.

So the correct answer should be option H.

To solve the quadratic equation \(6x^2 - 7x - 20 = 0\), we can factor it. The equation is in the form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\), where \(a = 6\), \(b = -7\), and \(c = -20\). Factoring involves finding two numbers that multiply to \(a \cdot c = 6 \cdot (-20) = -120\) and add up to \(b = -7\). These numbers are \(-15\) and \(8\). 

Rewriting the equation by splitting the middle term:

\[
6x^2 - 15x + 8x - 20 = 0.
\]

Grouping the terms:

\[
(6x^2 - 15x) + (8x - 20) = 0.
\]

Factoring out the common factors in each group:

\[
3x(2x - 5) + 4(2x - 5) = 0.
\]

Factoring out the common binomial factor \((2x - 5)\):

\[
(2x - 5)(3x + 4) = 0.
\]

Setting each factor equal to zero gives the solutions:

\[
2x - 5 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \frac{5}{2},
\]
\[
3x + 4 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = -\frac{4}{3}.
\]

Thus, the solutions are \(x = \frac{5}{2}\) and \(x = -\frac{4}{3}\). Comparing these with the given options, the correct choice is:

**H: \(\frac{5}{2}, -\frac{4}{3}\)**.
