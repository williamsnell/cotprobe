Okay, so I've got this problem here about dividend return and investment. Hmm, let me read it again. The dividend return per annum is $900, and that's an annual return of 6 percent. I need to find out how much was invested. 

Wait, dividend return is the money you get each year from an investment, right? And the percentage here is 6%. So I think I can model this with a simple equation. 

I remember that the dividend is calculated as a percentage of the investment. So if the investment is P, then the dividend would be P multiplied by the rate (which is 6% here). And that equals $900. 

So the equation would be: 900 = P * 6%. Oh wait, 6% as a decimal is 0.06. So 900 = P * 0.06.

To find P, I need to rearrange this. So P = 900 / 0.06. Let me calculate that. 

900 divided by 0.06. Hmm, let's see. 900 divided by 0.06 is the same as 900 multiplied by (100/6) because dividing by a decimal can be tricky. So 100 divided by 6 is approximately 16.6667. So 900 * 16.6667. Let me compute that step by step.

900 times 16 is 14,400. And 900 times 0.6667 is about 600. So adding them together, 14,400 + 600 equals 15,000. Oh wait, that's easy. So P is $15,000.

Wait, let me double-check. 15,000 multiplied by 6% should be 900. Yes, because 1% of 15,000 is 150, so 6% is 150 * 6 = 900. That makes sense.

Looking back at the options, option I is $15,000. So the answer should be I.

To determine the amount invested, we know that the annual dividend return is $900, which represents a 6% return on the investment. Let the investment be denoted as \( P \). The relationship can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Dividend} = P \times \text{Rate}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
900 = P \times 0.06
\]

To solve for \( P \), divide both sides by 0.06:

\[
P = \frac{900}{0.06} = 15,000
\]

Thus, the investment amount is $15,000. Comparing this result with the provided options, the correct answer is:

**I: $15,000.00**
