Question:

While undergoing a routine plastic surgery procedure, a patient died on the operating table. The patient's husband is suing the plastic surgeon alleging malpractice. Two years later, at trial, the defense called another doctor as an expert witness. The expert witness testified that the patient's death was a freak accident and that the surgeon's performance met the highest standards for medical care. On cross-examination, the plaintiff's attorney brings out the fact that, one week before trial, the expert witness and the surgeon signed an agreement to become partners in an outpatient plastic surgery clinic. The plaintiff's attorney suggests that the expert's testimony was awfully convenient and likely motivated by his desire to maintain a good relationship with the defendant. The defendant then calls another surgeon at the hospital as a witness. He is asked to tell the jury about a conversation he had with the expert inunediately following the patient's death. The witness stated that "the expert told me the patient's death was a textbook example of a freak accident and there was nothing anyone could have done to prevent it. "On objection to this testimony, defendant's attorney seeks a ruling on the admissibility of this question and answer. The trial judge should

Options:

A: overrule the objection, because a witness's veracity may be rehabilitated by a prior consistent statement.
B: sustain the objection, because the testimony is hearsay.
C: sustain the objection, because a prior consistent statement cannot be used to rehabilitate a witness's testimony.
D: overrule the objection, because the expert's statement is a statement against interest.
E: overrule the objection, because the statement supports the expert witness's credibility.
F: sustain the objection, because the statement is speculation and not based on factual evidence.
G: sustain the objection, because the statement is prejudicial and may unfairly influence the jury.
H: overrule the objection, because the statement was made immediately after the incident, making it a present sense impression and therefore not hearsay.
I: sustain the objection, because the witness's statement is unrelated to the case at hand.
J: overrule the objection, because the expert's statement is an exception to the hearsay rule as it was made in the course of his professional duty.

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this evidence question. Let me read through the scenario again and break it down step by step.

So, the situation is a trial where a patient died during plastic surgery, and the husband is suing for malpractice. The defense called an expert witness who testified that the surgeon met the highest standards and the death was a freak accident. On cross-examination, it came out that the expert and the surgeon are going to be partners in a clinic, which suggests a potential bias. The plaintiff's attorney is implying that the expert's testimony is motivated by this relationship.

Then, the defendant calls another surgeon as a witness. This surgeon testifies about a conversation he had with the expert right after the patient's death. He says the expert told him that it was a freak accident and nothing could have been done. The plaintiff's attorney objects, and we need to determine if this testimony is admissible.

The question is about the admissibility of this statement. The options are about hearsay, prior consistent statements, and other exceptions.

First, I need to recall the rules about hearsay and exceptions. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. If the statement is hearsay, it's generally inadmissible unless an exception applies.

In this case, the defense is offering the expert's prior statement to another surgeon. The purpose seems to be to show that the expert consistently said it was a freak accident, which would support his credibility, especially after the cross-examination about potential bias.

Wait, but when can prior consistent statements be used? I remember that prior consistent statements can be used to rehabilitate a witness's credibility if the witness has been impeached. But there are specific rules about this. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, a prior consistent statement can be used if it's offered to rebut a charge of recent fabrication or bias. But the statement must be one that the witness made at a time when they had no motive to lie.

In this scenario, the expert's prior statement was made before any potential bias (like the partnership) would have existed. Wait, noâ€”the expert and the surgeon became partners a week before the trial. So the prior statement was right after the incident, which was two years before the trial. So the expert's statement to the other surgeon was made way before the partnership agreement. Therefore, the statement was made at a time when there's no apparent motive to lie because the partnership hadn't happened yet.

So, the expert's credibility was attacked on cross by suggesting he's biased because of the upcoming partnership. The defense is trying to show that the expert's opinion was consistent before any such bias could have existed. That would fit the rule for using prior consistent statements to rebut a charge of bias or recent fabrication.

But wait, I also remember that prior consistent statements are generally not admissible unless they fall under an exception. Oh, but wait, under FRE 801(d)(1)(B), a statement is not hearsay if it's a prior statement by a witness who testifies and is subject to cross-examination, and it's consistent with the witness's testimony and offered to rebut a charge of recent fabrication or bias.

So in this case, the expert is the witness who testified, and the prior statement is consistent with his testimony. It's being offered to rebut the suggestion that his testimony was biased because of the partnership. Since the prior statement was made before any such bias could have occurred, it's admissible under 801(d)(1)(B) as a prior consistent statement that's not hearsay.

Wait, but the options don't all directly reference this. Let me look at the options again.

Option A says the objection is overruled because a witness's veracity may be rehabilitated by a prior consistent statement. But I thought prior consistent statements are allowed only under specific conditions, like rebutting bias, and that they are non-hearsay under the exception.

Option B is about hearsay, but if the statement is admissible under 801(d)(1)(B), then it's not hearsay.

Option C says prior consistent statements can't be used to rehabilitate, which would be incorrect if the statement fits the exception.

Option H says overrule because it's a present sense impression, which is another hearsay exception. But the statement was made immediately after the incident, which might qualify as a present sense impression under FRE 803(1) or (2). However, the primary issue here is using it to rebut bias, so the prior consistent statement exception is more directly applicable.

So, the correct reason would be that the prior statement is non-hearsay under 801(d)(1)(B), so the objection should be overruled. Looking at the options, which one matches this reasoning.

Option A suggests overruling because prior consistent statements can rehabilitate. That's correct in this context because the statement is admissible to rebut bias.

Wait, but let me double-check: FRE 613 allows for extrinsic evidence of a prior consistent statement to rebut a charge of bias, but only if the statement was made before the alleged bias arose. So in this case, the prior statement was made two years before the partnership, so it's admissible as extrinsic evidence.

But wait, the prior statement is being introduced through another witness, the surgeon who had the conversation. So it's extrinsic evidence of the expert's prior consistent statement.

FRE 613(b) says that if the statement is consistent with the witness's testimony and is offered to rebut a charge that the witness's testimony was biased or had a motive to lie, then extrinsic evidence of the statement is admissible despite the hearsay rule.

So the statement is hearsay, but it's admissible under FRE 613 as an exception. Alternatively, under 801(d)(1)(B), the statement is not hearsay if it's a prior consistent statement made by the witness while testifying and subject to cross, and it's offered to rebut a charge of bias.

Wait, but in this scenario, the prior statement is being offered by another witness, not the expert himself. So the expert is the declarant, and the other surgeon is the witness testifying about the statement. So it's extrinsic evidence, which would fall under FRE 613(b), not 801(d)(1)(B), because 801(d)(1)(B) applies when the witness themselves testify about their prior statement.

So, the defense is offering the statement through another witness, which is extrinsic evidence. Therefore, it's admissible under FRE 613(b) as a prior consistent statement to rebut bias.

But wait, the options don't directly reference FRE 613. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: overrule because prior consistent statement can rehabilitate. That's correct if it's admissible under 613.

Option B: sustain as hearsay. But if it's admissible under an exception, it's not hearsay.

Option H: present sense impression. Maybe, but that's a different exception.

So, the statement is hearsay unless an exception applies. The applicable exception here is FRE 613(b), which allows the use of the prior consistent statement to rebut the charge of bias. Since the prior statement was made before the alleged bias (partnership), it's admissible.

So the trial judge should overrule the objection because the testimony is admissible as a prior consistent statement under FRE 613(b).

Looking back at the options, option A says that veracity may be rehabilitated by a prior consistent statement, which is correct. Option H is about present sense impression, which might also apply, but the more precise reason is the prior consistent statement exception.

So the correct answer should be A, because the prior consistent statement is allowed to rehabilitate the expert's credibility after the bias was suggested.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused now. If the statement is being offered through another witness, does that affect anything? Because 801(d)(1)(B) requires the witness to testify about their own prior statement, but in this case, it's another witness testifying about the expert's prior statement.

Ah, right. So 801(d)(1)(B) wouldn't apply because that's for the same witness's prior statement. Here, the declarant is the expert, and the witness is the other surgeon. So it's extrinsic evidence, which falls under FRE 613(b). So the statement is hearsay, but it's admissible under the exception in 613(b).

In that case, the testimony is not hearsay because 613(b) allows it as an exception. Wait, noâ€”613(b) allows extrinsic evidence to be used, but the prior statement is still hearsay unless another exception applies. Wait, no, under 613(b), the prior consistent statement is admissible despite hearsay because it's used for a specific purpose (to rebut bias), but I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Alternatively, perhaps the statement is non-hearsay under 801(d)(1)(A) if it's a prior inconsistent statement, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, maybe it's admissible as a statement against interest, but that doesn't fit.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think that the prior statement is hearsay, but it's admissible under the exception for prior consistent statements to rebut bias under FRE 613(b). Therefore, the objection should be overruled.

Looking at the options, option A is about prior consistent statements being used to rehabilitate, which aligns with this reasoning. So the judge should overrule the objection, making option A correct.
</think>

The question revolves around the admissibility of a prior statement made by an expert witness that is introduced through another witness to rebut allegations of bias. The expert witness testified that the patient's death was a freak accident, but on cross-examination, it was revealed that the expert and the defendant surgeon were set to become partners, suggesting potential bias. The defense then called another surgeon who testified about a conversation with the expert immediately after the patient's death, where the expert made similar statements about the incident being a freak accident.

The key issue is whether this testimony is admissible. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE), hearsay is generally inadmissible unless an exception applies. The defense is offering the expert's prior statement to rebut the suggestion of bias, which is a valid purpose under FRE 613(b). This rule allows extrinsic evidence of a prior consistent statement to rebut a charge of bias, provided the statement was made before the alleged bias arose. Here, the expert's prior statement was made two years before the partnership agreement, satisfying this requirement.

While FRE 801(d)(1)(B) allows prior consistent statements to be admitted as non-hearsay if they are made by the witness themselves, this case involves extrinsic evidence (testimony from another witness about the expert's prior statement). Thus, FRE 613(b) is the applicable rule, as it permits the use of such evidence to rebut bias. The testimony is therefore admissible, and the trial judge should overrule the objection.

Among the options provided, the correct answer is:

**A: overrule the objection, because a witness's veracity may be rehabilitated by a prior consistent statement.**

This aligns with the reasoning that the prior consistent statement is admissible to rebut the charge of bias under FRE 613(b).
