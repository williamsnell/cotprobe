Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question is about a nucleus emitting a gamma ray and its recoil energy after that emission. Hmm, I remember that when a particle emits radiation, there's some recoil effect because of conservation of momentum. Oh right, like when a gun fires a bullet, the gun recoils backward.

So the nucleus was initially at rest. It emits a gamma ray, which has energy E_gamma. I need to find the recoil energy of the nucleus after emitting this gamma ray. The options are given from A to J, with various formulas.

Wait, I think this involves the concept of momentum conservation. Since the nucleus was at rest, the total momentum before emission is zero. After emission, the nucleus moves in one direction, and the gamma ray (photon) moves in the opposite direction. So their momenta must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

Photons have energy E = pc, where p is the momentum and c is the speed of light. So the momentum of the photon is p = E_gamma / c. But wait, isn't that the case? Because for photons, energy E equals pc, right, since they have zero mass and move at speed c.

So the nucleus must have a momentum equal and opposite to that of the photon. Let me denote the nucleus's momentum as P. Then P = -E_gamma/(c), but since we're interested in the magnitude, I can just take P = E_gamma/(c).

Now, the nucleus's kinetic energy (its recoil energy) is given by its kinetic energy, which is (P^2)/(2M), because for non-relativistic speeds, kinetic energy is (p²)/(2m). Wait, but M here is the mass of the nucleus, which is much larger than the photon, so maybe non-relativistic is a safe assumption.

So putting it all together. The momentum of the nucleus P is E_gamma/(c). So the kinetic energy K is ( (E_gamma/(c))^2 ) / (2M ). Let me write that as K = E_gamma²/(2 M c²). 

Wait, let me double-check the units to make sure. Energy squared divided by mass times c squared. Hmm, E has units of joules (kg m²/s²). So E² is kg² m^4/s^4. 2M c² is kg (m²/s²). So K would have units (kg² m^4/s^4) / (kg m²/s²) ) = kg m²/s², which is energy. That makes sense.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one matches E_gamma squared divided by (2 M c squared). Let me scan the options:

Option A: E^2/(4 M c²) → No, denominator is 4 instead of 2.

Option B: 2 E²/(M c²) → No, that's 2 E² over M c², which would make it twice as big as my answer.

Option C: E/(M c²) → That's linear in E, but I have E squared.

Option D: 3 E²/(2 M c²) → Coefficient 3/2, no.

Option E: E/(4 M c²) → Again, linear and small.

Option F: E/(2 M c²) → Still linear.

Option G: 4 E²/(M c²) → Bigger, no.

Option H: E²/(M c²) → Close, but no factor of 1/2.

Option I: E²/(2 M c²) → Oh, that's exactly what I have. So option I is the one.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Did I mix up anything? Oh, another thought: sometimes in these problems, you use relativistic equations. But since the nucleus is heavy and the photon's energy is probably small compared to the rest mass energy, non-relativistic should be fine. So I think my approach is correct.

Another check: the recoil energy should be small when M is large, which makes sense. So if E_gamma is fixed, a heavier nucleus has less recoil energy, which matches K being inversely proportional to M.

So I'm confident the answer is option I.

To determine the recoil energy of the nucleus after emitting a gamma ray, we apply the principle of momentum conservation. Initially, the nucleus is at rest, so the total momentum is zero. After emission, the nucleus recoils with momentum \( P \), and the gamma ray (photon) moves in the opposite direction with momentum \( p = \frac{E_\gamma}{c} \). By conservation of momentum, the magnitudes of the momenta are equal: \( P = \frac{E_\gamma}{c} \).

The recoil energy of the nucleus is its kinetic energy, which is given by \( K = \frac{P^2}{2M} \) for non-relativistic motion. Substituting \( P = \frac{E_\gamma}{c} \), the recoil energy becomes:

\[
K = \frac{\left(\frac{E_\gamma}{c}\right)^2}{2M} = \frac{E_\gamma^2}{2Mc^2}.
\]

This matches option I. The other options are incorrect because they either have the wrong coefficient, the wrong dependence on \( E_\gamma \), or incorrect units.
