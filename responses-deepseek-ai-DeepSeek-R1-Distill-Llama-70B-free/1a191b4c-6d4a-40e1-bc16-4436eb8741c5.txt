Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about what Singer says regarding international corporations dealing with corrupt dictators. The options are A through J, and I need to figure out which one is correct.

First, I remember that Singer is a philosopher known for his ethical arguments, especially concerning global poverty and the responsibilities of individuals and corporations. I think he's written about how companies that engage with corrupt regimes are contributing to injustice.

Looking at the options, let me go through each one to see which fits.

Option A: accomplices in the dictator's crimes. That makes sense because if a company knowingly does business with a corrupt dictator, they're enabling their actions. So they're like accomplices.

Option B: people who knowingly buy stolen goods. That's about receiving stolen goods, which is a crime. But in this context, it's more about the corporations aiding the dictators' actions rather than directly buying stolen goods. Not sure if this fits exactly.

Option C: thieves who steal from the poor. Hmm, not sure. The corporations might be exploiting resources, but are they the ones stealing directly? Maybe, but I'm not certain if Singer exactly says that.

Option D: merchants who sell harmful products. That could be about selling things like weapons, but I'm not sure if Singer's point is about the products themselves or the act of supporting dictators.

Option E: war profiteers exploiting conflict. That's a possibility. If the corporations are dealing with dictators in a conflict zone, they might be profiting from the war, which is similar to being war profiteers.

Option F: prostitutes who knowingly spread disease. That seems unrelated. Prostitutes spreading disease is a public health issue, not directly about corporate dealings with dictators.

Option G: bystanders who ignore injustice. No, because the question says they're dealing with the dictators, so they're actively involved, not just bystanders.

Option H: politicians who accept bribes. That's about individuals taking bribes, not corporations dealing with dictators.

Option I: all of the above. Well, that would mean all the options are correct, but I don't think that's the case because some options don't fit as well as others.

Option J: murderers of those who witness crimes. That seems too extreme and specific. I don't recall Singer making that comparison.

Now, thinking back to Singer's arguments, especially in his book "The Life You Can Save," he discusses how individuals and corporations have a moral obligation to help those in need and avoid contributing to harm. When corporations deal with corrupt dictators, they're enabling oppression and human rights violations. So they're more like accomplices in the dictators' crimes, which is Option A.

But wait, I also remember Singer talking about how such dealings can perpetuate poverty and injustice, which might align with being accomplices. But could there be another comparison he makes?

Alternatively, in some of his lectures or other works, Singer might compare them to people who buy stolen goods. Because if a dictator steals resources from their country, and a corporation buys those resources, they're knowingly dealing in stolen goods. So that would align with Option B.

Wait, I'm a bit confused now. Is the correct answer A or B?

Let me think again. The question is asking what the corporations are akin to. If they're dealing with corrupt dictators, they're supporting their regime, making them accomplices. But if the dictators are stealing resources, then the corporations buying those resources are like fences who buy stolen goods.

So which comparison does Singer use? I think in the context of resource extraction, Singer might argue that the corporations are complicit in the theft, making them like people who buy stolen goods. But I'm not 100% sure.

Alternatively, maybe Singer uses both comparisons, but the question is asking which one. Since the options are separate, I need to pick the best fit.

Wait, the question says "according to Singer," so I should recall his exact argument. I think in his book, he indeed compares them to people who buy stolen goods because the dictators have ill-gotten gains, and the corporations are profiting from that. So that would make Option B correct.

But I'm getting a bit tangled here. Or maybe he uses the accomplice analogy. I'm a bit unsure, but I'll have to make a choice based on what I think is more accurate.

The correct answer is A: accomplices in the dictator's crimes.
