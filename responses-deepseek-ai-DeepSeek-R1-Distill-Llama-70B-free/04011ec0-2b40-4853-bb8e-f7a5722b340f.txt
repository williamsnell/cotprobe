Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again carefully. The question is about the limit superior of a sequence of exponentially distributed random variables divided by the logarithm of n. Specifically, they're asking for P(lim sup X_n / log n = 1) as n approaches infinity. Hmm, okay.

So, I remember that the exponential distribution has the parameter lambda, which in this case is 1. So each X_n is independent and has the pdf f(x) = e^{-x} for x >= 0. Now, the lim sup is involved. Lim sup, right, that's the limit superior. So, lim sup of a sequence is the supremum of the set of all limit points of the sequence. Another way to think about it is that for every epsilon > 0, lim sup a_n <= M + epsilon for infinitely many n. But I might be getting that part a bit confused.

Wait, the question is about the probability that the lim sup of X_n / log n equals exactly 1. So, when we talk about lim sup, we're looking for the behavior as n becomes very large. I think there's a theorem related to the lim sup of random variables, maybe something like the Borel-Cantelli lemma or results on extreme value theory.

I recall that for a sequence of independent random variables, the lim sup can sometimes be determined using their tail probabilities. Since the X_n are exponential, their tail probabilities are easy to write down. The CDF for X_n is 1 - e^{-x}, so the probability that X_n > x is e^{-x}.

So, let's consider the events where X_n / log n is greater than some value. If we're looking for lim sup X_n / log n = 1, that suggests that for infinitely many n, X_n / log n is close to 1, and for the rest, it's not exceeding 1. Or wait, maybe it's about the lim sup being exactly 1, so the sequence X_n / log n doesn't go above 1 infinitely often, but gets as close to 1 as needed infinitely often.

I think I remember something about the lim sup a_n = c if two conditions are met: 1) a_n <= c eventually (i.e., for all sufficiently large n), and 2) a_n >= c infinitely often. So, for our case, lim sup X_n / log n = 1 would mean that X_n / log n <=1 for all n beyond some point, and X_n / log n >=1 infinitely often.

Wait, but that might not be exactly right. Because lim sup is the supremum of all the limit points, which in this case, if the lim sup is 1, then 1 is the largest accumulation point. So, the sequence X_n / log n would get arbitrarily close to 1 infinitely often, but not exceed 1 infinitely often (or maybe it does, but the lim sup is still 1). Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of the events where X_n / log n > 1 + epsilon and X_n / log n < 1 - epsilon. So, for lim sup X_n / log n =1, we'd need that for any epsilon>0, X_n / log n >1 - epsilon infinitely often, and X_n / log n <=1 + epsilon eventually.

Wait, I think I'm mixing up the definition. Let me try to recall: For lim sup a_n = c, the necessary and sufficient condition is that for every epsilon>0, a_n > c - epsilon infinitely often, and a_n <= c + epsilon eventually.

So, in our case, lim sup X_n / log n = 1 implies that for any epsilon>0, X_n / log n > 1 - epsilon infinitely often, and X_n / log n <=1 + epsilon eventually.

But wait, for the lim sup to be exactly 1, perhaps we need that X_n / log n doesn't exceed 1 too much beyond a certain point, but also gets close to 1 infinitely often.

But the problem is about the probability that lim sup X_n / log n equals 1. So, what's the chance that the lim sup is exactly 1?

Alternatively, I think that in general, for independent exponentially distributed variables, the lim sup of X_n / log n is a known result. Wait, I think that the lim sup of X_n / log n is almost surely 1. Because for each n, the probability that X_n >= log n + log log n tends to zero, but the Borel-Cantelli lemma would say that if the sum of probabilities diverges, then the lim sup is at least that.

Wait, let me think again. The exponential distribution's tail is P(X_n > x) = e^{-x}. So, if we set x = log n + log log n, then P(X_n > x) = e^{-(log n + log log n)} = 1/(n log n). The sum over n of 1/(n log n) diverges, right? Because the integral of 1/(x log x) dx from 2 to infinity is log log x, which goes to infinity. So, by the second Borel-Cantelli lemma, since the events are independent, the lim sup of X_n / log n is at least (log n + log log n)/log n = 1 + (log log n)/log n, which tends to 1 as n increases. So, the lim sup would be at least 1 almost surely.

Wait, but when we take the lim sup, perhaps the actual value is 1 because any higher value would have a converging series. So, let me try to make this precise.

Suppose that for any epsilon > 0, we look at the events A_n = {X_n >= (1 + epsilon) log n}. The probability P(A_n) = e^{-(1 + epsilon) log n} = n^{-(1 + epsilon)}. The sum over n of n^{-(1 + epsilon)} converges because 1 + epsilon > 1. So, by Borel-Cantelli, the probability that A_n occurs infinitely often is zero. Therefore, with probability 1, X_n < (1 + epsilon) log n for all sufficiently large n. So, lim sup X_n / log n <= 1 + epsilon. Since epsilon is arbitrary, lim sup X_n / log n <=1.

But earlier, I thought that for x = log n, P(X_n > log n) = 1/n. Sum of 1/n diverges, so infinitely many X_n > log n. So, lim sup X_n / log n >=1. So, combining both results, lim sup X_n / log n =1 almost surely.

Therefore, the probability that lim sup X_n / log n =1 is 1. So, the answer should be B: 1.0.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because sometimes with lim sup, you have to be careful about the exact conditions.

Wait, let's see. For each epsilon>0, P(X_n >= (1 - epsilon) log n) = e^{-(1 - epsilon) log n} = n^{-(1 - epsilon)}. So, the sum of P(X_n >= (1 - epsilon) log n) is sum n^{-(1 - epsilon)}. If 1 - epsilon <1, which it is for epsilon <1, then 1 - epsilon <1, so the exponent is less than 1, so the sum diverges. So, by Borel-Cantelli, since the X_n are independent, the event that X_n >= (1 - epsilon) log n occurs infinitely often. Thus, lim sup X_n / log n >= (1 - epsilon). Since this is true for any epsilon>0, lim sup X_n / log n >=1.

Earlier, we saw that lim sup X_n / log n <=1 because for any epsilon>0, X_n < (1 + epsilon) log n eventually. So, combining both, lim sup X_n / log n =1 almost surely.

Thus, the probability is 1, which is option B.

The problem involves determining the probability that the limit superior of the sequence \( X_n / \log n \) equals 1, where \( X_n \) are independent and identically distributed exponential random variables with parameter 1. The key steps to solve this are as follows:

1. **Understanding the Lim Sup**: The lim sup of a sequence is the supremum of all its limit points. For \( \limsup_{n \to \infty} X_n / \log n = 1 \), it means:
   - For any \( \epsilon > 0 \), \( X_n / \log n \geq 1 - \epsilon \) infinitely often.
   - For any \( \epsilon > 0 \), \( X_n / \log n \leq 1 + \epsilon \) eventually.

2. **Tail Probabilities of \( X_n \)**: The exponential distribution has the property \( P(X_n > x) = e^{-x} \). Using this, we analyze the events:
   - \( P(X_n \geq (1 + \epsilon) \log n) = e^{-(1 + \epsilon) \log n} = n^{-(1 + \epsilon)} \). The series \( \sum n^{-(1 + \epsilon)} \) converges because \( 1 + \epsilon > 1 \). By the Borel-Cantelli lemma, \( X_n / \log n \leq 1 + \epsilon \) eventually, almost surely.
   - \( P(X_n \geq (1 - \epsilon) \log n) = e^{-(1 - \epsilon) \log n} = n^{-(1 - \epsilon)} \). The series \( \sum n^{-(1 - \epsilon)} \) diverges because \( 1 - \epsilon < 1 \). By the Borel-Cantelli lemma, \( X_n / \log n \geq 1 - \epsilon \) infinitely often, almost surely.

3. **Combining Results**: From the above, we conclude:
   - \( \limsup_{n \to \infty} X_n / \log n \leq 1 \) almost surely.
   - \( \limsup_{n \to \infty} X_n / \log n \geq 1 \) almost surely.
   - Therefore, \( \limsup_{n \to \infty} X_n / \log n = 1 \) almost surely.

4. **Conclusion**: Since the lim sup equals 1 with probability 1, the probability \( P(\limsup_{n \to \infty} X_n / \log n = 1) = 1 \).

The correct answer is **B: 1.0**.
