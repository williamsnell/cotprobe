Question:

In 1981, a devoted conservationist, was the owner of a 100-acre tract of undeveloped land. In that year, the conservationist conveyed the tract "to my nephew in fee simple, provided, however, that the grantee agrees that neither he nor his heirs or assigns shall ever use the property for any commercial purpose. If any portion of said tract is used for other than residential purposes, then the grantor or his successors in interest may re-enter as of the grantor's former estate. " This deed was properly recorded. The nephew died intestate in 1999, survived by his wife. The conservationist died in 2002, survived by his two daughters, his only heirs. During the period between 1981 and 2007, the spreading development from a nearby city began to engulf the tract. Though still undeveloped, the tract became surrounded by office buildings, shopping malls, and other commercial edifices. In 2009, the wife executed and delivered to a developer a fee simple conveyance of the tract, which the developer immediately recorded. The deed did not contain any reference to the restriction noted above. After the developer acquired title to the tract, he commenced construction of a hotel complex on a portion of the tract that bordered an apartment building. The applicable recording statute in effect in this jurisdiction provides, in part, "No deed or other instrument in writing, not recorded in accordance with this statute, shall affect the title or rights to, in any real estate, or any devisee or purchaser in good faith, without knowledge of the existence of such unrecorded instruments. "If one of the daughters brings suit to enjoin the developer from constructing the hotel, the plaintiff will most likely

Options:

A: lose, because the developer was a bona fide purchaser for value without notice of the restriction.
B: win, because either daughter has the right of re-entry for condition broken.
C: win, because the restriction on commercial use was recorded and thus the developer should have been aware of it.
D: lose, because a common development scheme had been established for the entire tract.
E: win, because either daughter's right to the tract vested immediately upon the developer's construction of the hotel complex.
F: lose, because the restriction was not included in the deed from the wife to the developer.
G: lose, because the wife had the right to sell the property without any restrictions.
H: win, because the developer violated the deed's prohibition against commercial use.
I: win, because the daughters, as the conservationist's only heirs, received a valid possibility of reverter from their father.
J: lose, because the restriction on the use of the property is unenforceable.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about property law, specifically dealing with deeds, restrictions, and recording statutes. Hmm, let's try to break this down step by step.

First, let me read the question carefully. So, in 1981, a conservationist conveyed a 100-acre tract to his nephew in fee simple, but with a condition. The condition is that neither the nephew nor his heirs or assigns can use the property for any commercial purpose. If they do, the grantor (the conservationist) or his successors can re-enter and take back the estate. The deed was properly recorded.

Then, the nephew died intestate in 1999, survived by his wife. The conservationist died in 2002, leaving two daughters as his only heirs. Between 1981 and 2007, the area around the tract became developed with office buildings and shopping malls. But the tract itself remained undeveloped.

In 2009, the wife sold the tract to a developer via a fee simple conveyance. The deed didn't mention the restriction, and the developer recorded it immediately. Now, the developer is building a hotel on part of the tract. The question is about whether one of the daughters can successfully sue to stop the developer.

The recording statute in the jurisdiction says that unrecorded deeds don't affect the title or rights of a bona fide purchaser in good faith without knowledge of the unrecorded instrument.

So, the options are about whether the daughter wins or loses, and why.

I think the key issues here are whether the restriction is enforceable against the developer, considering the recording statute and whether the developer is a bona fide purchaser.

Let me recall some property law concepts. A fee simple determinable or with a condition subsequent can create a future interest, like a right of re-entry. The original grantor here created a condition subsequent, giving the right to re-enter if the property is used commercially.

Now, the recording act. The type of statute matters. If it's a notice, race, or race-notice statute. The given statute says that unrecorded instruments don't affect a purchaser in good faith without knowledge. So, it's a notice-type statute because it protects purchasers without knowledge, regardless of when they record.

So, when the nephew's wife sold to the developer, the developer would be protected if they were a bona fide purchaser without notice of the restriction.

Wait, but the original deed was recorded in 1981. So, when the developer took the property in 2009, would they have had constructive notice of the restriction because it was recorded?

But here's the thing: the deed from the nephew's wife to the developer didn't include the restriction. So, when the developer records, does their deed reference the prior restriction? Or does the original deed's recording suffice to put them on notice?

Wait, no. The original deed was from the conservationist to the nephew, which included the restriction. So, that deed was recorded. So, when the developer takes the property from the wife, they would have done a title search and found that original deed, which includes the restriction. Therefore, the developer would have had constructive notice of the restriction because it's in the chain of title.

Wait, but let me think. The chain of title would show the conservationist conveying to the nephew with the restriction. So, any subsequent purchaser would be expected to find that. Therefore, the developer would have had constructive notice because the restriction was recorded.

But then, the developer's deed from the wife didn't mention the restriction. Does that matter? I think not, because the restriction is in the original deed, so it's a burden that runs with the land. Subsequent deeds don't need to restate it for it to be enforceable.

So, if the developer had done a proper title search, they would have found the original deed's restriction. Therefore, they had constructive notice, meaning they can't claim bona fide purchaser status without knowledge.

Wait, but if the developer didn't actually know about it, but should have known because it was recorded, then under a notice statute, they are charged with knowledge. So, they can't be a bona fide purchaser without notice.

Therefore, the restriction would still be enforceable against the developer, and the daughters, as successors to the conservationist's right of re-entry, could enforce it.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the developer was a bona fide purchaser without notice. But if the restriction was recorded, the developer had constructive notice, so A is incorrect.

Option B says the daughter wins because of the right of re-entry for condition broken. That seems possible.

Option C says the restriction was recorded, so the developer should have known. That also seems correct.

Option E says the daughter's right vested upon the developer's construction. That's about when the right becomes possessory, which might be true, but the main issue is the enforceability against the developer.

Option I talks about a possibility of reverter. Wait, the original grant was in fee simple subject to a condition subsequent, which gives a right of re-entry, not a possibility of reverter. So I might be incorrect.

So, between B and C. Let me think: the key is whether the developer had notice. Since the original deed was recorded, the developer is charged with knowledge, so the restriction is enforceable. Therefore, the daughters can enforce the right of re-entry because the condition was breached.

So, option B says they win because either daughter has the right of re-entry for condition broken. That seems right.

Alternatively, option C says the restriction was recorded, so developer should have been aware. That's also correct reasoning. So which option is better?

The question is about who has the right to enforce. The original grant gave the right to the grantor or his successors. The conservationist's successors are his daughters. So they have the right to enforce the condition.

So, option B is about the right of re-entry, which the daughters have. Option C is about the developer's notice. Both could be correct, but the better answer is probably B because it addresses the right of enforcement, while C might be a correct statement but perhaps not the reason for the outcome.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. If the developer had constructive notice, then the restriction is enforceable against them. So the daughters can enforce it because the restriction was properly recorded, and the developer can't claim bona fide purchaser status without notice.

So option C says they win because the restriction was recorded, so the developer should have known. That would make the developer bound by the restriction.

Alternatively, option B says they win because of the right of re-entry.

I think both B and C could be correct in their reasoning, but perhaps the key is whether the restriction is enforceable against a subsequent purchaser.

Wait, in this case, the developer is a purchaser from the wife. The wife's ownership came from the nephew, who had the fee simple with the restriction. So the wife's title was subject to the restriction. When she sold to the developer, the developer takes subject to the restriction if they had notice.

So, since the restriction was recorded, the developer had constructive notice. Therefore, the restriction is enforceable, and the daughters can enforce it.

So, the correct reasoning is that the restriction was recorded, so the developer is bound, making option C correct.

Wait, but option B is about the right of re-entry. So, the daughters have that right, which is correct. So both B and C seem correct. Hmm.

Wait, let me think about it. The daughters are the ones bringing the suit. They have the right of re-entry because the condition was breached. The question is whether they can enforce it against the developer.

So, the developer, having constructive notice, is bound by the restriction. Therefore, the daughters can enforce the right of re-entry.

So, the correct answer would be option B, because it's about the right of re-entry, which is the cause of action here.

Wait, but another possibility is that the right of re-entry is a future interest held by the grantor's successors. So when the condition is breached, the holder of that future interest can exercise it.

So, the daughters, as successors, can enforce the right. So, option B would be correct.

Alternatively, option C's reasoning is also correct—developer had notice—so the outcome is the same. But the question is phrased as whether the daughters win, so the basis is their right.

Hmm, perhaps the better answer is option B because it directly addresses the right of enforcement, whereas option C is about the developer's notice, which is a factor but perhaps not the primary reason for the outcome.

Wait, but I'm a bit torn here. Let me think about the elements. For the daughters to prevail, they need to show that (1) the restriction is enforceable, and (2) they have the right to enforce it.

So, the developer being bound by the restriction is key. So, if the developer had constructive notice, they are bound. Therefore, option C's reasoning is that the developer should have known, making the restriction enforceable.

But option B says the daughters have the right to re-enter because the condition was broken. That's also correct.

Wait, perhaps both options B and C are correct in their reasoning, but the answer depends on which is the best fit.

Looking at the options again:

A: lose because developer is bona fide without notice. Unlikely, because the restriction was recorded.

B: win because right of re-entry. Correct.

C: win because restriction was recorded, developer should have known.

E: win because right vested upon construction. That seems more about when the right becomes exercisable, which might be true, but not the main issue.

I think the correct answer is B. Because the daughters have the right to enforce the condition subsequent, which was breached. The fact that the developer had notice (option C) is a factor, but the primary reason for the victory is the existence of the right of re-entry.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because the developer's status as a bona fide purchaser is crucial. If the developer didn't have notice, they might prevail. But since the restriction was recorded, they had constructive notice, so they can't be a bona fide purchaser without notice. Therefore, the restriction is enforceable against them.

So, the daughters can enforce the right of re-entry because the condition was breached, and the developer is bound by the restriction.

So, the correct answer would be B or C.

Wait, perhaps the answer is B. Because the question is about the daughters' right, not just the developer's notice.

Alternatively, in some jurisdictions, when a condition subsequent is breached, the right of re-entry must be affirmatively exercised, often through a legal action. So the daughters would need to take action to enforce it.

But given the options, I think the best answer is B: win because either daughter has the right of re-entry for condition broken.

Wait, but looking back, the original deed says "the grantor or his successors in interest may re-enter." So the daughters, as successors, have that right.

So, I think the correct answer is B.

The question revolves around a property law dispute involving a restrictive covenant and the enforceability of a right of re-entry against a subsequent purchaser. In 1981, the conservationist conveyed the property to his nephew in fee simple, subject to a condition that the property could not be used for commercial purposes. The deed was properly recorded, creating a condition subsequent and granting the conservationist and his successors the right of re-entry if the condition was violated. The nephew died intestate, and his wife later sold the property to a developer in 2009. The developer began constructing a hotel, breaching the restriction. The jurisdiction's recording statute protects bona fide purchasers in good faith without knowledge of unrecorded instruments, but the original deed with the restriction was recorded, placing the developer on constructive notice.

Key analysis of the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The developer cannot claim bona fide purchaser status without notice because the restriction was recorded in 1981. Constructive notice applies, and the developer should have been aware of the restriction upon a proper title search.

- **Option B**: Correct. The daughters, as successors to the conservationist, hold the right of re-entry. The condition subsequent was breached when the developer began commercial use, and the daughters can enforce this right.

- **Option C**: Plausible but less precise. While it is true that the restriction was recorded and the developer should have known about it, the primary reason for the daughters' victory is their right of re-entry based on the breach of the condition subsequent.

- **Option D**: Incorrect. There is no evidence of a common development scheme established for the tract.

- **Option E**: Incorrect. The daughters' right to enforce the restriction does not vest upon the developer's construction; it exists by virtue of the original deed and the breach of the condition.

- **Option F**: Incorrect. The omission of the restriction in the deed from the wife to the developer does not negate its enforceability, as the restriction was already part of the chain of title.

- **Option G**: Incorrect. The wife's title was subject to the restriction, and she could not convey unrestricted title to the developer.

- **Option H**: Incorrect. While the developer violated the prohibition against commercial use, this option does not address the enforceability of the restriction or the daughters' right of re-entry.

- **Option I**: Incorrect. The original conveyance created a right of re-entry, not a possibility of reverter.

- **Option J**: Incorrect. The restriction is enforceable as it was properly recorded and constitutes a valid condition subsequent.

The best answer is **Option B**, as it directly addresses the daughters' right of re-entry, which is the primary basis for their ability to enforce the restriction against the developer.

**Answer: B**
