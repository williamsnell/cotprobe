Okay, so I have this question about Lassa and Ebola viruses and their origins. I'm a bit rusty on my virology, but let me think through this.

First, I remember that both Lassa and Ebola are hemorrhagic fever viruses. They're pretty deadly and are considered emerging viruses in West Africa. The question is about their origin, so I need to figure out their natural reservoirs.

I think I've heard something about Ebola originating from bats. Yeah, I'm pretty sure that fruit bats are the natural host for Ebola. They carry the virus without getting sick themselves. As for Lassa, I believe it's different. I recall that Lassa fever is transmitted through contact with infected rodents, specifically the multimammate mouse. So the virus is maintained in the rodent population.

Looking at the options, the question gives two viruses, so I need an option that covers both. Let me check the choices again:

A: Reptiles — I don't think either virus comes from reptiles.
B: Birds — No, I don't remember birds being linked to these.
C: Primates — Well, Ebola can be transmitted to primates, but they're not the origin. The bats are.
D: Humans — Definitely not the origin, as they're zoonotic.
E: Cattle — I don't think so. Maybe some other viruses, but not these.
F: Amphibians — No connection that I recall.
G: Insects — Some viruses come from insects, like mosquitoes, but not these two.
H: Pigs — I don't think pigs are the natural hosts for either.

Wait, but the options are for both Lassa and Ebola. Since Lassa comes from rodents (which are mammals) and Ebola from bats (also mammals), the closest option would be H: Pigs? No, that doesn't fit. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me think again.

Oh wait, the options don't have 'rodents' as an option. So looking at the given choices, the possible answer would be based on the category. Both bats and rodents are mammals. But none of the options directly say mammals. Let me look again.

The options are:

A: Reptiles
B: Birds
C: Primates
D: Humans
E: Cattle
F: Amphibians
G: Insects
H: Pigs

Hmm, none of these are bats or rodents. Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe it's asking about what they infect, not their origin. No, the question is about their origin.

Wait, maybe the question is considering their emergence in humans. But that's not the origin; it's about where they come from in nature. So the natural reservoir.

So for Lassa, it's the multimammate mouse (rodent), and for Ebola, fruit bats. So the origin is rodents and bats, both of which are mammals. But the options don't include mammals in general. So looking at the options, C is primates. No, because bats are not primates. Primates are like monkeys and apes. So maybe the answer is C? But that doesn't fit because bats are not primates.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The question says both Lassa and Ebola are emergent in W. Africa, what's their origin. So their natural hosts.

Since the options don't have 'bats' or 'rodents', maybe the closest is 'mammals', but that's not an option. So perhaps the answer is C: Primates? But no, because that's not correct.

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me check what I know again. Lassa virus is carried by Mastomys rodents. Ebola's natural reservoir is fruit bats, like from the Pteropodidae family. So, both are mammals, but the options don't have a mammal category except for C (primates), E (cattle), H (pigs), etc.

Wait, perhaps the answer is C: Primates. But no, because bats are not primates. So maybe the answer isn't listed, but that can't be the case because it's a multiple-choice question.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is G: Insects, but that's not correct because neither comes from insects.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake. Let me think again. Oh wait, maybe the question is referring to the origin as in the animal from which they first infected humans. But no, the natural reservoir is the origin.

Wait, another thought: The question says "their origin", meaning where they come from, so the natural host. Since both viruses have mammalian origins, but the options don't have a mammal category. So perhaps the answer is C: Primates, but that's incorrect because the natural hosts are bats and rodents.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to when the viruses emerge in humans, but that's not about their origin.

Wait, maybe I should look for the answer based on common knowledge. I've heard that Ebola is linked to bats, and Lassa to rodents. So the origin is mammals, but in the options, the closest would be C: Primates? No.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think of the answer options again. The options are A through H, and the answer is one of them. So perhaps the intended answer is C: Primates, but that's not correct. Or maybe H: Pigs? No, pigs aren't the reservoir for either.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that can't be. So perhaps I'm wrong about the origins.

Wait, another angle: Maybe the viruses originated in humans. But no, both are zoonotic, meaning they come from animals.

Wait, maybe the answer is G: Insects. But no, these are not insect-borne viruses. They're transmitted through contact with infected animals or their waste.

Hmm, perhaps the answer is C: Primates. But I thought bats and rodents are the hosts. Wait, perhaps the question is considering that both viruses can infect primates, including humans, but their origin is elsewhere.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should just go with what I know. Lassa comes from rodents (so mammals), and Ebola from bats (also mammals). So the origin is mammals, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is C: Primates, but that's incorrect because bats are not primates. Alternatively, I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the answer is H: Pigs. No, pigs aren't the natural hosts for either.

Wait, maybe the question is referring to the intermediate hosts. For example, in some cases, Ebola might be transmitted through apes or monkeys to humans, but the natural reservoir is still bats.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to conclude. Since both viruses have mammalian origins, but the options don't include that, perhaps the intended answer is C: Primates. But that's not accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is G: Insects, but that's wrong. So maybe I'm wrong and the answer is C.

Wait, no, I think another approach: Maybe the answer is C: Primates because both can infect primates, but that's not their origin. I'm stuck.

Wait, I think I'll go with C: Primates, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is H: Pigs, but no.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the origin is non-human primates for Ebola, but no, it's bats. So I'm back to square one.

I think I need to make an educated guess. Since both have mammalian origins, but the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is C: Primates. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is G: Insects, but that's incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is C: Primates, but I'm not confident. Maybe I should think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm wrong about the origin of Lassa. Wait, Lassa is from rodents, which are mammals. Ebola from bats, which are mammals. So both have mammalian origins. But the options don't have mammals as a choice. So perhaps the answer is C: Primates because that's the closest, but that's not accurate.

Wait, maybe the answer is H: Pigs. No, pigs aren't the natural hosts.

I think I'm stuck, but I have to choose. Based on what I know, the origin is mammals, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the intended answer is C: Primates, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the answer is G: Insects, but that's wrong.

Wait, perhaps the answer is C: Primates, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and the answer is C.

Wait, another way: Let's think about each virus. Lassa is from rodents (mammals), Ebola from bats (mammals). So both are mammals, but the options don't have that. So perhaps the answer is C: Primates, but that's not correct. Alternatively, maybe the answer is G: Insects, but that's wrong.

Wait, maybe I'm wrong and the answer is H: Pigs. No, I don't think so.

Hmm, perhaps the answer is C: Primates. I'll go with that, but I'm not sure.

The question asks about the origin of Lassa and Ebola viruses in West Africa. Both viruses are zoonotic, meaning they originate from animal reservoirs before potentially infecting humans. Lassa fever is maintained in the multimammate mouse (a rodent), while Ebola is linked to fruit bats as its natural reservoir. Both bats and rodents are mammals, but the provided answer options do not include "mammals" as a category. 

Analyzing the options:
- **A: Reptiles** and **F: Amphibians**: Neither virus is associated with these groups.
- **B: Birds** and **G: Insects**: These are not linked to the origin of either virus.
- **D: Humans**: Incorrect, as both viruses are zoonotic and originate from animals.
- **E: Cattle** and **H: Pigs**: These are not the natural reservoirs for either virus.
- **C: Primates**: While Ebola can infect primates (including humans and non-human primates), its natural reservoir is bats, not primates. Similarly, Lassa fever originates from rodents, not primates.

Given the options, none accurately reflect the true origins of these viruses. However, based on the closest available choice, **C: Primates** might be the intended answer, even though it is not entirely accurate.

Answer: C
