Alright, let me try to figure out the answer to this question. So the question is about the alternative form of a 'network organization' and what it means. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I should understand what a network organization is. From what I remember, a network organization is a type of business structure that's different from the traditional hierarchical model. It's more about connections and collaboration. So maybe it involves working with other groups or individuals outside the company itself.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the company operates solely through social media. Hmm, that seems too specific. I don't think network organizations are only about social media. They might use it, but it's not the definition.

Option B suggests no physical office and all tasks online. That sounds more like a virtual company or remote work setup, not necessarily a network organization. Although some network organizations might operate this way, it's not the core definition.

Option C mentions each department working independently with no interaction. That's the opposite of a network organization, which is all about collaboration and connectivity between different departments or entities.

Option D says work is subcontracted to independent suppliers and retailers. Oh, this sounds familiar. I think network organizations often outsource work to external partners, creating a network of suppliers and maybe even retailers. This way, the company can focus on its core competencies while others handle different parts.

Option E is about all employees working remotely. Again, this relates more to remote work than the structure of a network organization.

Option F talks about transactions only through electronic communication. That might be a part of it, especially in modern times, but I don't think it's the defining characteristic.

Option G is about having multiple branch offices. That's more like a traditional multinational company rather than a network organization.

Option H mentions no hierarchy, everyone at the same level. That's more of a flat organization structure, not specifically a network organization.

Option I refers to the Japanese model with lateral networks. I'm not too sure about this one, but I think the Japanese model might relate to something else, like Keiretsu, which are different.

Option J is about equal distribution of activities between genders, which doesn't relate to the structure of a network organization.

So putting it all together, the key idea of a network organization is that it's a structure where the company doesn't do everything in-house. Instead, it subcontracts or partners with other independent entities to perform various tasks. This allows the company to be more flexible and efficient. So the best fit here seems to be option D.

The alternative form of 'network organization' refers to a business structure that emphasizes collaboration and outsourcing. It involves subcontracting work to independent suppliers and retailers, allowing the company to focus on core competencies while leveraging external expertise. This structure enhances flexibility and efficiency. 

The correct answer is D.
