Okay, so I've got this question about Thomas Pogge's arguments, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the question is about what duties people in wealthy countries have towards the global poor, according to Pogge. The options are from A to J, and I need to choose the right one.

I remember that Pogge is a philosopher who focuses on global justice and human rights. His work often discusses how wealthy nations contribute to poverty in developing countries, not just through inaction but through their actions and policies. So, the key here is understanding the type of duties he argues we have.

The question states that because we've directly caused harm, Pogge argues for very stringent duties. So, it's about the nature of these duties. Let's think about the different types of duties mentioned in the options.

Option A: Libertarian duties. Libertarians usually emphasize negative rights, like freedom from interference. They focus on non-aggression and property rights. I'm not sure if Pogge aligns with that because his arguments are more about positive obligations to help.

Option B: Positive duties. Positive duties involve actively doing something, like providing aid or assistance. Since Pogge talks about how we've caused harm, maybe this is about taking positive actions to rectify that harm. But I'm not entirely certain yet.

Option C: Duty-free. That doesn't make sense. If we've caused harm, we can't be duty-free. So I can eliminate this option.

Option D: Liberal duties. Liberal here might refer to classical liberalism, which is more about individual freedoms and limited government intervention. Not sure if that's exactly what Pogge is arguing for.

Option E: Consequentialist duties. Consequentialism is about actions being right if they lead to the best outcomes. While Pogge might consider consequences, I think his argument is more rooted in rights and duties rather than purely consequentialist reasoning.

Option F: Conservative duties. Conservatives often prioritize tradition and stability. I don't think Pogge's arguments align directly with conservative ideologies in this context.

Option G: Negative duties. Negative duties are about not causing harm or not interfering. If we've directly caused harm, negative duties would imply stopping the harmful actions, but I'm not sure if that's the focus here. Pogge might argue for more than just stopping harm; perhaps also repairing or providing aid.

Option H: Utilitarian duties. Utilitarianism focuses on maximizing overall utility. While Pogge's approach might have some utility considerations, I don't think he's a strict utilitarian. His focus is more on justice and rights.

Option I: Human rights duties. This sounds promising. Pogge is known for his work on human rights and how our actions violate the rights of the global poor. He argues that we have duties based on human rights to address the harm we've caused.

Option J: Egalitarian duties. Egalitarianism emphasizes equality. While Pogge does discuss global inequality, his main argument is about the violation of human rights rather than solely on achieving equality.

So, putting it together: Pogge argues that we have stringent duties because of the harm we've caused, which relates to human rights. Therefore, the correct answer should be I: human rights duties towards the global poor.

The question revolves around Thomas Pogge's argument that individuals in wealthy countries have stringent duties towards the global poor due to the harm they have directly caused. Pogge's work emphasizes human rights violations resulting from the actions and policies of wealthy nations. Among the options, "human rights duties" aligns most closely with Pogge's focus on addressing harm through the lens of human rights obligations.

Answer: I
