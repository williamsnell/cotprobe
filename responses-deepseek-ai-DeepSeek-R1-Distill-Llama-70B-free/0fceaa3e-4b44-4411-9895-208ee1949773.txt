Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. So the question is about finding the expected value E(X) and the variance Var(X) of a random variable X. The probabilities for each outcome are given in a table. Let me write down what I know.

The table gives me the possible values of X and their corresponding probabilities. Let me list them out:

- X = 0 with probability 8/27
- X = 1 with probability 12/27
- X = 2 with probability 6/27
- X = 3 with probability 1/27

Wait, let me make sure I got that right. Yeah, those are the four possible outcomes and their probabilities. Now, I need to compute E(X) and Var(X) using these values.

First, I'll tackle the expected value, E(X). I remember that the expected value is calculated by multiplying each outcome by its probability and then summing all those products. So the formula is E(X) = Σ [x_i * P(X = x_i)].

Let me compute each term:

1. For X=0: 0 * (8/27) = 0
2. For X=1: 1 * (12/27) = 12/27
3. For X=2: 2 * (6/27) = 12/27
4. For X=3: 3 * (1/27) = 3/27

Now I'll add these up:

0 + 12/27 + 12/27 + 3/27 = (12 + 12 +3)/27 = 27/27 = 1.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, 12 +12 is 24, plus 3 is 27. So 27/27 is 1. So E(X) is 1? Hmm, but looking at the options, option D says E(X)=1. I'll note that down.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations. Because 12/27 is 4/9, 6/27 is 2/9, and 1/27 is 1/27.

Wait, X=0: 0*(8/27) is 0. X=1: 1*(12/27) is 12/27. X=2: 2*(6/27) is 12/27. X=3: 3*(1/27) is 3/27. So 12 + 12 is 24, plus 3 is 27. 27/27 is 1. So yes, E(X) is 1.

Now onto the variance, Var(X). I remember that variance is calculated as E(X²) - [E(X)]².

So I need to compute E(X²) first. E(X²) is Σ [x_i² * P(X = x_i)].

Let me compute each term:

1. X=0: 0² * 8/27 = 0
2. X=1: 1² *12/27 = 12/27
3. X=2: 2² *6/27 = 4*(6/27) = 24/27
4. X=3: 3² *1/27 =9/27

Now sum these up:

0 + 12/27 +24/27 +9/27 = (12 +24 +9)/27 = 45/27 = 5/3.

Wait, 45 divided by 27 is 5/3 because 27 goes into 45 once with 18 left, 18 is 2/3 of 27. So 1 and 2/3, which is 5/3. So E(X²) is 5/3.

Now, Var(X) = E(X²) - [E(X)]² = (5/3) - (1)^2 = 5/3 -1 = 2/3.

So Var(X) is 2/3.

Wait, but looking back at the options, option D says E(X)=1 and Var(X)=2/3. So that's the one that fits.

Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me recalculate E(X²):

X² values:

0² =0 → 0 *8/27=0
1²=1 →1 *12/27=12/27
2²=4 →4 *6/27=24/27
3²=9 →9 *1/27=9/27

Adding them: 0 +12 +24 +9 =45 →45/27=5/3. Correct.

E(X)=1, so [E(X)]²=1.

5/3 -1 = (5 -3)/3 = 2/3. Correct.

So the correct option is D: E(X)=1, Var(X)=2/3.

To compute the expected value \( E(X) \) and the variance \( \text{Var}(X) \) of the random variable \( X \), we use the given probability distribution:

\[
\begin{array}{c|c}
x_i & \text{Pr}(X = x_i) \\
\hline
0 & \frac{8}{27} \\
1 & \frac{12}{27} \\
2 & \frac{6}{27} \\
3 & \frac{1}{27} \\
\end{array}
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( E(X) \)
The expected value \( E(X) \) is calculated as:
\[
E(X) = \sum [x_i \cdot \text{Pr}(X = x_i)]
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
E(X) = (0 \cdot \frac{8}{27}) + (1 \cdot \frac{12}{27}) + (2 \cdot \frac{6}{27}) + (3 \cdot \frac{1}{27})
\]
\[
E(X) = 0 + \frac{12}{27} + \frac{12}{27} + \frac{3}{27} = \frac{27}{27} = 1
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( E(X^2) \)
The variance requires \( E(X^2) \), which is calculated as:
\[
E(X^2) = \sum [x_i^2 \cdot \text{Pr}(X = x_i)]
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
E(X^2) = (0^2 \cdot \frac{8}{27}) + (1^2 \cdot \frac{12}{27}) + (2^2 \cdot \frac{6}{27}) + (3^2 \cdot \frac{1}{27})
\]
\[
E(X^2) = 0 + \frac{12}{27} + \frac{24}{27} + \frac{9}{27} = \frac{45}{27} = \frac{5}{3}
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \text{Var}(X) \)
The variance is given by:
\[
\text{Var}(X) = E(X^2) - [E(X)]^2
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Var}(X) = \frac{5}{3} - (1)^2 = \frac{5}{3} - 1 = \frac{2}{3}
\]

### Final Answer
The expected value is \( E(X) = 1 \), and the variance is \( \text{Var}(X) = \frac{2}{3} \). Comparing these results with the options, the correct choice is:

**D: \( E(X) = 1 \), \( \text{Var}(X) = \frac{2}{3} \)**
