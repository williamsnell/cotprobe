Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to find the right answer. Let's see what it's about. The question is about the ratio of toucans to parrots in a zoo. The zoo has 15 toucans and 60 parrots. I remember that ratios compare two numbers, showing how much of one thing there is compared to another.

So, the first thing I should do is identify the numbers given. Toucans are 15, and parrots are 60. The ratio we're looking for is toucans to parrots, which means I should put the number of toucans first and parrots second.

Wait, ratio of toucans to parrots is 15:60. But ratios are usually simplified, right? So I need to find a way to reduce this ratio to its simplest form. To simplify, I should find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 15 and 60. 

Let me think, the factors of 15 are 1, 3, 5, 15. For 60, the factors include 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60. The common factors are 1,3,5,15. The biggest one is 15. So dividing both numbers by 15 should give me the simplified ratio.

15 divided by 15 is 1, and 60 divided by 15 is 4. So the simplified ratio is 1:4. That means for every toucan, there are four parrots. 

Now, looking at the options provided. Let me go through them one by one.

Option A is 1:03. Hmm, that doesn't look right because 03 is just 3, so it's 1:3. But our simplified ratio is 1:4, so A is not it.

Option B is 60:15. Wait, that's the reverse of the original numbers. The question asks for toucans to parrots, which is 15:60, not the other way around. Plus, this ratio isn't simplified either. So B is incorrect.

Option C is 4:01. Oh, that's 4:1. Again, seems reversed. If it were parrots to toucans, maybe, but the question isn't asking that. So C is wrong.

Option D is 1:04. Oh, that's 1:4. That's exactly what I got after simplifying. This looks promising. But let me check the other options just to be sure.

Option E is 3:01, which is 3:1. Not matching our ratio. Option F is 15:60. That's the original ratio before simplifying. So F is the same as the numbers given, not the simplified version. The question doesn't specify if it needs to be simplified, but usually, ratios are presented in their simplest form, so D is better than F.

Option G is 5:04, which is 5:4. Doesn't match. Option H is 1:05, which is 1:5. Not right. Option I is 4:05, which is 4:5. Nope. Option J is 5:01, which is 5:1. Not matching.

So the correct simplified ratio is 1:4, which is option D.

The ratio of toucans to parrots is calculated by comparing the number of toucans (15) to the number of parrots (60). To simplify the ratio 15:60, we divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is 15. This results in the simplified ratio 1:4. Among the given options, D (1:04) correctly represents this simplified ratio.

Answer: D
