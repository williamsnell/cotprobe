Okay, so I have this graph problem to solve. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question is about finding the shortest path from node 2 to node 10 in an undirected graph. The edges are given as E = {<2,6>, <2,8>, <2,5>, <6,5>, <5,8>, <6,10>, <10,8>}.

First, I need to visualize or perhaps draw the graph to understand the connections. Let's list out all the edges:

- Node 2 is connected to 6, 8, and 5.
- Node 6 is connected to 2, 5, 10.
- Node 5 is connected to 2, 6, 8.
- Node 8 is connected to 2, 5, 10.
- Node 10 is connected to 6 and 8.

So, the goal is to find the shortest path from 2 to 10. The shortest path would be the one with the least number of edges. Since all edges are undirected and have the same weight (which I assume is 1), the path with the fewest nodes is the shortest.

Let me list all possible paths from 2 to 10 and then pick the shortest one.

Starting from node 2:
- From 2, possible next nodes are 6,8,5.

Let's explore each possibility.

Option 1: 2 -> 6
From 6, connected nodes are 2,5,10. So from 6, moving to 10 would be a direct connection. So the path is 2-6-10. That's two edges, so path length is 2. But wait, wait—no, the path length is the number of edges. So 2 edges mean 3 nodes. Let me see the options if this is present.

Option 2: 2 -> 8
From 8, connected to 2,5,10. So from 8, can go directly to 10. So the path is 2-8-10. Also two edges, so same length as the first option.

Option 3: 2 ->5
From 5, connected to 2,6,8. So from 5, let's see where to go. Let's try each:

5->6: Then from 6, can go to 10. So path is 2-5-6-10. That's three edges, so longer than the first two options.

5->8: Then from 8, go to 10. So path is 2-5-8-10. Also three edges.

So the shortest paths are 2-6-10 and 2-8-10, each with two edges. But wait, looking at the answer options, do these paths exist?

Looking at the options:

Option E is [2,6,8,10], which is three edges. Option F is [2,8,10], which is two edges. Option G is [2,6,10], which is two edges. Option C is [2,6,5,10], which is three edges.

So the possible shortest paths are G and F.

Wait, but in the options, G is [2,6,10], and F is [2,8,10]. Are both of these present in the options?

Yes. So which one is correct? Or wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that both are possible.

Wait, let me check the edges again. The edges are:

Edges from 2: 6,8,5.

Edges from 6: connected to 10, yes. So 2->6->10 is a valid path of length 2.

Edges from 8: connected to 10, yes. So 2->8->10 is a valid path of length 2.

So both G and F options are possible, each with length 2. But the question is to choose the shortest path.

Wait, but the options may not have both. Let me look again.

Looking at the options given:

Option F: [2,8,10]

Option G: [2,6,10]

So both are present. So why the options have two different choices for the shortest path?

Wait, the answer options are A to J. Let me check the options again:

Options:

A: [2,8,5,10] → 3 edges.

B: [2,5,6,8,10] → 4 edges.

C: [2,6,5,10] → 3 edges.

D: [2,5,6,10] → 3 edges.

E: [2,6,8,10] → 3 edges.

F: [2,8,10] → 2 edges.

G: [2,6,10] → 2 edges.

H: [2,5,8,10] →3 edges.

I: [2,10] → Wait, but is 2 connected directly to 10? Looking at the edges given: no. The edges are <2,6>, <2,8>, <2,5>. So 2 is not directly connected to 10. So option I is invalid.

So the shortest paths are F and G. But the options only have F and G as possible two-edge paths.

Wait, but the problem says "the shortest path". If there are multiple shortest paths, which one is correct? Or perhaps I've made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the way the graph is built. Let me try to represent the graph as adjacency lists.

Adjacency list:

2: [6,8,5]

6: [2,5,10]

8: [2,5,10]

5: [2,6,8]

10: [6,8]

So from 2, neighbors are 6, 8,5.

So possible first steps:

2->6: then from 6, can go to 10. So path 2-6-10.

2->8: from 8, can go to 10. So 2-8-10.

2->5: then from 5, can go to 6 or 8. If we go to 6, then 6 to 10. So 2-5-6-10 (3 edges). Similarly, 2-5-8-10 (3 edges).

So the two shortest paths are 2-6-10 and 2-8-10, each with two edges.

Looking back at the options, both F and G are present. So why are the options designed that way? Maybe the question expects one correct answer. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming both are correct. Let me check the edges again.

Edge between 2 and 10? No, the edges given are E = {<2,6>, <2,8>, <2,5>, <6,5>, <5,8>, <6,10>, <10,8>}.

So 2 is not connected to 10, so option I is invalid.

So possible options for the shortest path are F and G.

Wait, but the options in the problem are A to J. So looking again:

Options:

A: [2,8,5,10] → 3 edges.

B: [2,5,6,8,10] →4.

C: [2,6,5,10] →3.

D: [2,5,6,10] →3.

E: [2,6,8,10] →3.

F: [2,8,10] →2.

G: [2,6,10] →2.

H: [2,5,8,10] →3.

I: [2,10] → invalid.

J: [2,8,5,6,10] →4.

So both F and G are correct as they have two edges. But the options don't have both as correct. So perhaps the correct answer is either F or G.

But wait, the way the question is phrased is, "what is the shortest path from node 2 to node 10? Represent the path as a list." So if there are multiple shortest paths, any of them would be correct. But the problem is that the options list each possible path, so perhaps the correct answer is either F or G.

Looking at the options, both F and G are in the list.

So perhaps the correct answer is both F and G. But the user is expecting one option to choose.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the adjacency list. Let me recheck.

Edges:

<2,6> → 2 connected to 6.

<2,8> → 2 connected to 8.

<2,5> → 2 connected to 5.

<6,5> →6 connected to5.

<5,8> →5 connected to8.

<6,10> →6 connected to10.

<10,8> →10 connected to8.

So 10 is connected to 6 and 8.

So from 2, you can go to 6 then 10, or 8 then 10.

So both are valid, shortest paths.

But the options only have F and G as possible two-edge paths. So which one is correct?

Looking at the options, the answer must be either F or G.

Wait, but the options are given as possible choices, so perhaps the intended answer is F or G, depending on the graph structure.

Wait, maybe I should count the number of nodes. The path [2,6,10] is 3 nodes, which is two edges. Same for [2,8,10].

So the possible correct options are F and G.

But the problem says "the shortest path". If both are equally short, then perhaps both are correct. But the user expects one answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me see the options again.

Looking at the options, option F is [2,8,10], which is two edges.

Option G is [2,6,10], two edges.

So both are correct, but the question probably expects one answer. So perhaps I made a mistake in the adjacency list.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the edge weights are not all the same. But the question says it's an undirected graph, and doesn't mention edge weights, so I assume each edge has the same weight of 1.

So the conclusion is that the shortest path has two edges, and the possible paths are 2-6-10 and 2-8-10.

Looking back at the options, both F and G exist, but the options are mutually exclusive. So perhaps the intended answer is option F or G.

Wait, but perhaps the problem considers the order of the nodes or the way they're listed. Let me think again.

Wait, the problem may have the correct answer as either F or G. But looking at the options, perhaps I should see which one is listed first or something. Alternatively, perhaps one of them isn't a valid path.

Wait, no, both are valid. So perhaps I should look for another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use BFS to find the shortest path.

Let's perform BFS starting from node 2.

Initialize a queue with node 2. Mark node 2 as visited.

Queue: [2]

Level 1:

Dequeue 2. Enqueue all its neighbors that haven't been visited: 6,8,5.

Mark them as visited.

Queue: [6,8,5]

Level 2:

Dequeue 6. Its neighbors are 2 (visited),5,10. So enqueue 5 and 10.

Wait, but 5 is already in the queue. So when we process 6, we enqueue 10.

So now, queue becomes [8,5,10].

When we reach 10 in the queue, we stop, as it's the target.

So the path from 2 to 10 is via 6, so the path is 2-6-10.

Alternatively, when processing 8 from the queue, which comes after 6, processing 8 would enqueue 5 (already in queue) and 10. So 10 would be reached via 8 as well.

Wait, but in BFS, the first occurrence of the target is the shortest path.

So in the BFS, when we process 6, we reach 10, so the path is 2-6-10. Then when processing 8, 10 is already visited, so we don't process it again.

So the BFS gives us the shortest path as 2-6-10.

Wait, but wait, the BFS queue processes nodes in the order they are enqueued. So when processing 6, we enqueue 10. Then, when processing 8, we also get 10, but since 10 is already visited, we don't enqueue it again.

But the path through 6 is found first, but the path through 8 has the same length. So both are valid shortest paths.

Hmm. So perhaps both F and G are correct, but in the options, both are presented.

Wait, but looking back at the options, the answer options are A to J, and each is a single choice. So perhaps the correct answer is either F or G, but the options may have only one correct. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is F.

Wait, let's think differently. Maybe the edges are directed, but the problem states it's an undirected graph, so that shouldn't matter.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm making a mistake in the BFS. Let me retrace.

BFS steps:

Start with 2.

Queue: [2], visited: {2}.

Process 2: enqueue 6, 8,5.

Now queue: [6,8,5], visited: 2,6,8,5.

Process 6: look at its neighbors. 2 is visited. 5 is visited. 10 is unvisited. So enqueue 10.

Now, since 10 is the target, the path is 2->6->10.

So BFS finds this path first, so that's the shortest path.

But wait, processing 8 after 6 would also reach 10, but with the same number of steps.

So both 2-6-10 and 2-8-10 are shortest paths.

But the problem is to choose from the given options, so both F and G are possible. But the options don't allow selecting multiple choices, so perhaps the intended answer is one of them.

Looking at the options, perhaps the correct answer is F: [2,8,10] and G: [2,6,10].

Wait, but the options given are A to J. So perhaps the correct answer is both F and G are correct, but the options only have one correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer to be the lex smallest path, but that's not a standard approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the answer in the options. Let me see what the options include.

Looking again, option F is [2,8,10], which is correct.

Option G is [2,6,10], which is also correct.

So both are correct, but the options only have each as a single option. So perhaps the correct answer is either F or G, but the user expects one.

Wait, perhaps I should count the number of options. The options are:

A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J.

So the correct options are F and G.

But the problem asks to choose from A to J, so perhaps the intended answer is one of them, maybe F or G.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F, because in BFS the first path found is 2-6-10, but in the queue, 6 is processed before 8, so 2-6-10 is the first found.

Wait, no, processing 6 first, so 2-6-10 is the first path found. So the answer would be G: [2,6,10].

But I'm a bit confused because both are correct.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is G, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the answer in the options provided.

Wait, let me list the options again.

The options are:

A: [2,8,5,10]

B: [2,5,6,8,10]

C: [2,6,5,10]

D: [2,5,6,10]

E: [2,6,8,10]

F: [2,8,10]

G: [2,6,10]

H: [2,5,8,10]

I: [2,10]

J: [2,8,5,6,10]

So both F and G are options. But according to BFS, the first path found is G.

But perhaps the question expects any of the shortest paths, but the options have both, so the correct answer would be either F or G.

Wait, but the options are to choose one. So perhaps the correct answer is F and G are both correct, but the options only allow one selection. So perhaps I need to choose between them.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F or G, but the problem expects the one with the smallest node numbers.

Wait, but that's not a standard approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I should look for the answer in the adjacency list.

Wait, perhaps it's better to list all possible paths and their lengths.

Possible paths from 2 to 10 with their lengths:

1. 2-6-10 → length 2.

2. 2-8-10 → length 2.

3. 2-5-6-10 → length 3.

4. 2-5-8-10 → length 3.

5. 2-6-5-10 → same as 3.

6. 2-8-5-10 → same as 4.

So the shortest paths are the first two.

So the correct options are F and G.

But the problem expects one answer.

Wait, perhaps the intended answer is G, as it's listed before F in the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is F.

But I'm not sure. Maybe the correct answer is F: [2,8,10].

Wait, but in the BFS, the first path found is 2-6-10, so G is the first shortest path found.

So perhaps the intended answer is G.

But I'm a bit stuck here. Since both are correct, but the options list both, perhaps the correct answer is either F or G.

Wait, perhaps I should think differently. Let me see what the options include.

Looking again, option F is [2,8,10], which is two edges.

Option G is [2,6,10], two edges.

So both are correct. But the question expects one answer.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the graph structure. Let me recheck.

Edges:

<2,6>, <2,8>, <2,5>, <6,5>, <5,8>, <6,10>, <10,8>.

So 6 is connected to 10, and 8 is connected to 10. So both 2-6-10 and 2-
