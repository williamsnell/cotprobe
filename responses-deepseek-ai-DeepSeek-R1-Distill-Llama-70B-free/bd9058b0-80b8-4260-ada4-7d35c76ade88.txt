Okay, so I've got this problem here about determining the molecular weight of a gas. Hmm, I remember from my chemistry class that molecular weight is calculated using the ideal gas law. The formula we usually use is PV = nRT, right? But wait, molecular weight is the molar mass, so I think I'll need to find the number of moles first and then use the grams to get the molar mass.

Let me read the problem again. It says 4.50 grams of the gas occupies 4.0 liters at 950 torr and 182°C. Oh wait, the temperature is in Celsius, so I need to convert that to Kelvin. Oh right, Kelvin is Celsius plus 273.15. So 182 + 273.15 equals... let's see, 182 + 273 is 455, plus 0.15 makes 455.15 K. I'll just round that to 455 K for simplicity.

The pressure is given in torr, but the gas constant R is given in liter-atm per mole per Kelvin. So I need to convert torr to atm. I remember that 1 atm is 760 torr. So 950 torr divided by 760 equals... let's calculate that. 950 / 760 is approximately 1.250 torr. Wait, no, wait. 760 torr is 1 atm. So 950 torr is 950 / 760 atm. Let me compute that. 950 divided by 760. Let's see: 760 times 1.25 is 950, right? Because 760 * 1 = 760, 760 * 0.25 is 190, so 760 + 190 is 950. Oh right, so 950 torr is 1.25 atm.

So now I have P as 1.25 atm, V is 4.0 liters, T is 455 K. R is 0.082 L·atm/(mol·K). I need to find n, the number of moles, because the molar mass M is mass (grams) divided by moles (n). So first, find n using PV = nRT.

Rearranging the formula, n = PV/(RT). Plugging in the numbers: (1.25 atm * 4.0 L) / (0.082 L·atm/mol·K * 455 K). Let me compute the numerator and denominator step by step.

Numerator: 1.25 * 4.0 = 5.0 atm·L.

Denominator: 0.082 * 455. Let's calculate that. 0.08 * 455 is... 0.08 * 400 = 32, 0.08 * 55 = 4.4, so 36.4. But since it's 0.082, it's a bit more. Let me compute 455 * 0.082.

455 * 0.08 is 36.4. 455 * 0.002 is 0.91. So adding them together, 36.4 + 0.91 = 37.31. So denominator is 37.31 (units would be L·atm/mol).

So n = 5.0 / 37.31. Let me compute that. 5 divided by 37.31. Hmm, 37.31 * 0.134 is about 5. Because 37 * 0.13 is 4.81, and 0.004*37 is 0.148, so 4.81 + 0.148 = 4.958. Close enough. So n ≈ 0.134 moles.

Wait, let me check that calculation again. 37.31 * 0.134. Let me do it more accurately.

37.31 * 0.1 = 3.731.

37.31 * 0.03 = 1.1193.

37.31 * 0.004 = 0.14924.

Adding those together: 3.731 + 1.1193 = 4.8503. Plus 0.14924 gives 5.0 (approximately). So yes, n ≈ 0.134 mol.

Now, the mass is 4.50 grams. So the molar mass M is mass divided by moles: 4.50 g / 0.134 mol. Let me compute that. 4.5 / 0.134. Hmm, 0.134 is about 1/7.463. So 4.5 * 7.463. Let me compute 4 * 7.463 = 29.852. 0.5 *7.463=3.7315. Sum is 29.852 +3.7315=33.5835. So approximately 33.58 g/mol.

Wait, but wait, I think I might have made a mistake in calculating n. Let me double-check the numbers.

Wait, the denominator was 37.31, and the numerator is 5. So 5 /37.31 is approximately 0.1342 mol. Then, 4.50 / 0.1342 is about 33.5.

But looking at the options, the choices are:

A: 28.1
B:35.2
C:36.5
D:26.4
E:27.3
F:31.9
G:32.2
H:29.8
I:30.5
J:34.7

Hmm, my calculation gave me around 33.5, but the options don't have that. The closest would be option J:34.7 or B:35.2, but wait, maybe I made a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, maybe I messed up the pressure conversion. Let me recheck that.

Pressure is 950 torr. Since standard atm is 760 torr, so 950 /760 = ?

950 /760: Let me compute. 760 *1 is 760, 760*1.25 is 950. Oh wait, yes, 1.25 atm. So that part is correct.

Wait, maybe the temperature? 182°C is 455.15 K, which I approximated as 455 K. That's correct.

So PV = 1.25 atm *4.0 L =5.0 atm·L.

RT =0.082 *455 = let me compute that again more accurately.

0.082 *455:

Break it down, 400 *0.082 = 32.8.

55 *0.082 = 4.51.

So 32.8 +4.51 =37.31. So RT is 37.31. So n=5/37.31= 0.1342 mol.

Molar mass M=4.50 /0.1342.

Let me compute that more accurately.

4.50 /0.1342 = ?

Let me compute 0.1342 *33 = 4.4286.

0.1342 *33.5= 33 *0.1342=4.4286, plus 0.5 *0.1342=0.0671. So total 4.4957. That's very close to 4.50.

So 0.1342 *33.5=4.4957. So 4.50 is 4.50 -4.4957=0.0043 more.

So 0.0043 /0.1342 is approximately 0.032, so 33.5 +0.032=33.532.

So M≈33.53 g/mol.

But none of the options are close to 33.5. So I must have made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, the options don't have 33.5, so perhaps I did a miscalculation earlier.

Wait, perhaps I should carry more precise numbers.

Let me recalculate n precisely.

n = PV/(RT) = (1.25 atm *4.0 L) / (0.082 L·atm/mol·K * 455.15 K)

Compute denominator: 0.082 *455.15.

Let me compute 455 *0.082.

455 *0.08 = 36.4.

455 *0.002=0.91.

So 36.4 + 0.91=37.31. But since the temperature is 455.15, it's 455.15 *0.082.

Wait, 455.15 - 455 =0.15, so 0.15 *0.082=0.0123. So denominator is 37.31 +0.0123=37.3223.

So denominator is 37.3223.

n =5 /37.3223.

Let me compute 5 /37.3223.

37.3223 *0.134=?

37 *0.134=4.958.

0.3223 *0.134= approx 0.04315.

So total 4.958 +0.04315=5.00115. So 0.134 is the correct value for n.

So n=0.134 mol.

Then M=4.50 /0.134 = ?

Let me compute 4.50 /0.134.

Let me consider 0.134 *33 =4.422.

Difference: 4.50 -4.422=0.078.

Now, 0.078 /0.134= approx 0.582.

So total M=33 +0.582=33.582 g/mol.

So about 33.58, which is approximately 33.6 g/mol.

But the options don't have that. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of n. Let me try a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps using the ideal gas law to find moles and then molar mass is the way, but maybe I messed up the pressure unit conversion.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the pressure was converted incorrectly. Let me recheck.

950 torr to atm: since 1 atm=760 torr, so 950 /760 = ?

950 ÷760 =1.250.

Yes, that's correct.

Hmm. So perhaps I should look at the options again. Wait, the options are A to J. Let me look at option J:34.7. Could it be that I miscalculated something?

Wait, perhaps I should check my calculation using a calculator approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects to use a different value for R. Oh wait, the problem gives R as 0.082 L·atm/mol·K, which is correct, so that shouldn't be an issue.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the number of significant figures. Let me see.

Given data: 4.50 g (3 sig figs), 4.0 L (2 sig figs), 950 torr (3 sig figs?), 182°C (3 sig figs). So perhaps the least number is 2, but maybe the calculation requires 3.

Wait, but in my calculation, I ended up with 33.5 g/mol, which is not among the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in setting up the equation.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe I used the wrong formula. Oh wait, the formula is correct, n=PV/(RT), then M=mass/n.

Wait, perhaps the units for R were different, but no, the given R is 0.082 L·atm/mol·K, which matches the units I used.

Wait, perhaps I should try re-doing the calculation with more precise numbers.

Compute n:

n = (1.25 atm *4.0 L) / (0.082 L·atm/mol·K * 455.15 K)

n =5 / (0.082 *455.15)

Compute denominator: 0.082 *455.15.

Let me compute this accurately.

0.082 * 455.15:

First compute 455 *0.082.

455 *0.08 =36.4.

455 *0.002=0.91.

So 36.4 +0.91=37.31.

Then, 0.15 *0.082=0.0123.

So total denominator is 37.31 +0.0123=37.3223.

So n=5 /37.3223 = approximately 0.1342 mol.

Then, M=4.50 g /0.1342 mol = approx 33.53 g/mol.

Hmm, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I made a mistake in pressure.

Wait, wait. Oh! Wait a second. I think I made a mistake in the pressure unit. Because 1 atm is 760 torr, so 950 torr is 950/760 atm. Let me compute that accurately.

950 ÷760 = 1.250.

Wait, 760 *1.25=950, yes. So that's correct.

Hmm, perhaps I should consider the significant figures. The volume is given as 4.0 L, which is two sig figs. So maybe the final answer should be reported to two sig figs, which would make it 34 g/mol. But the options don't have that either.

Wait, let me check the problem again. Oh, wait! The question says 'molecular weight of a gas', which is the same as molar mass, so yeah, I'm correct in using grams per mole.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of R*T. Let me compute 0.082 *455.15.

Let me compute 0.082 *455.15.

Compute 455 *0.082:

455 *0.08 =36.4.

455 *0.002=0.91.

So 36.4 +0.91=37.31.

Then, 0.15 *0.082=0.0123.

So total is 37.31 +0.0123=37.3223.

So yes, denominator is 37.3223.

n=5/37.3223=0.1342 mol.

M=4.50 / 0.1342 =33.53 g/mol.

Hmm, but none of the options are around 33.5. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering the units.

Wait another thought: Did I confuse grams with kilograms? No, because the given mass is in grams, and R is in terms of liters, which is compatible with grams when using the correct gas constant.

Wait, perhaps the given R is actually 0.0821 instead of 0.082? Let me check the problem statement. It says R=0.082, so that's correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute n more accurately. Let's do a precise division of 5 by 37.3223.

37.3223 × 0.134 = ?

Let me compute 37.3223 ×0.134:

37.3223 *0.1 =3.73223

37.3223 *0.03=1.119669

37.3223 *0.004=0.1492892

Adding these: 3.73223 +1.119669 =4.8519, plus 0.1492892 =5.0011892.

So 37.3223 ×0.134=5.0011892, which is just over 5. So 5 ÷37.3223 is 0.134 approximately.

Wait, but maybe I should consider more decimal places.

Let me compute 5 ÷37.3223 using long division.

37.3223 ) 5.000000

37.3223 goes into 50 once (because 37.3223*1=37.3223), subtract from 50: 50-37.3223=12.6777.

Bring down a zero: 126.777.

37.3223 goes into 126.777 three times (3 *37.3223=111.9669). Subtract: 126.777-111.9669=14.8101.

Bring down a zero:148.101.

37.3223 goes into 148.101 three times (3*37.3223=111.9669). Subtract:148.101-111.9669=36.1341.

Bring down a zero:361.341.

37.3223 goes into 361.341 about 9 times (9*37.3223=335.9007). Subtract:361.341-335.9007=25.4403.

Bring down a zero:254.403.

37.3223 goes into 254.403 about 6 times (6*37.3223=223.9338). Subtract:254.403-223.9338=30.4692.

Bring down a zero:304.692.

37.3223 goes into 304.692 about 8 times (8*37.3223=298.5784). Subtract:304.692-298.5784=6.1136.

Bring down a zero:61.136.

37.3223 goes into 61.136 once (1*37.3223=37.3223). Subtract:61.136-37.3223=23.8137.

Bring down a zero:238.137.

37.3223 goes into 238.137 about 6 times (6*37.3223=223.9338). Subtract:238.137-223.9338=14.2032.

So far, the value is 0.134136...

Wait, so n≈0.134136 mol.

Then M=4.50 g /0.134136 mol = ?

Let me compute that.

4.50 ÷0.134136.

Let me write it as 4500 mg ÷0.134136 mol.

But perhaps it's easier to compute 4.50 /0.134136.

Compute:

0.134136 *33 =4.426488.

4.50 -4.426488 =0.073512.

Now, 0.073512 /0.134136 = approximately 0.548.

So M≈33 +0.548=33.548 g/mol.

Still around 33.55, which isn't in the options.

Hmm, maybe I need to check if I copied the problem correctly. Let me re-read the question.

Wait, the question says 4.50 g occupies 4.0 liters at 950 torr and 182°C. R is 0.082. Did I miss any numbers? No, that's correct.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the pressure. Let me think again: 950 torr is how many atm?

950 divided by 760.

Let me compute 760 ×1.25=950. So yes, 950 torr is 1.25 atm.

Wait, perhaps the problem expects the use of 22.4 L/mol somewhere? No, that's only at STP, which is different conditions.

Hmm, perhaps the mistake is in the formula used. Let me think: Alternatively, the molar mass can be found via (mass) * R * T /
