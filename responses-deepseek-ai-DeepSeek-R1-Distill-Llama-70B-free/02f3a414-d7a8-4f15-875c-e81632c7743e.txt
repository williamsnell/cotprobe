Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Alright, the problem is about compressing ethane gas in a three-stage reciprocating compressor. The flow rate is 200 cubic feet per minute at standard conditions. The initial pressure is 11 psia, and it's being compressed up to 1000 psia. The mechanical efficiency is 85%, and they're using cooling water in the intercoolers and aftercooler to bring the gas back to 70°F each time. They're using 20 gallons per minute of water, and I need to find the change in temperature of the water and the power required to drive the compressor.

Hmm, okay, so the first part is about the temperature change of the water. The second part is about calculating the power needed, which I think relates to the work done in compressing the gas, considering the mechanical efficiency.

Let me break it down. I think the key here is to calculate the heat removed by the cooling water and then use that to find the temperature change. Also, the work done on the gas will relate to the power required.

Wait, but the gas is being compressed in three stages with intercooling. So each stage will compress the gas partway, and then it's cooled back to the initial temperature before the next stage. That makes sense because cooling between stages reduces the work needed and prevents overheating.

First, I need to find the temperature change of the water. For that, I think I should calculate the total heat removed from the gas during compression and intercooling, and then equate that to the heat absorbed by the water.

But wait, the gas is being compressed in three stages. So each stage will have some compression, followed by cooling. So the heat from each stage's compression is removed by the water. Plus, after the final compression stage, there's an aftercooler.

So the total heat removed would be the sum of the heat from each intercooler plus the aftercooler.

But to calculate the heat, I think I need to find the work done in each stage and relate that to the heat transfer.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider the entire process from 11 psia to 1000 psia, but since it's done in stages, each stage has an ideal compression to an intermediate pressure, and the gas is cooled between stages.

Wait, perhaps I should first determine the intermediate pressures for each stage. Since it's a three-stage compressor, the compression ratio per stage would be the nth root of the total compression ratio, where n is the number of stages. So n=3 here.

The total compression ratio is 1000 psia / 11 psia. Let me calculate that. 1000 divided by 11 is approximately 90.91. So the cube root of 90.91 is about 4.49. So each stage would have a compression ratio of roughly 4.5.

Wait, but sometimes for multistage compression with intercooling, each stage's compression ratio is the same, so the overall is the product of each stage's ratio. So with three stages, each stage has a ratio of (1000/11)^(1/3) ≈ 4.49.

So each stage would compress the gas by approximately 4.49 times the inlet pressure.

Now, for each stage, the process is isentropic compression followed by cooling back to the initial temperature. So each stage's work can be calculated using the specific heat at constant pressure (Cp) and the temperature change during compression.

Wait, but for an isentropic process, the work can be calculated using the formula for compressor work, which for a gas with constant specific heats is:

W = T1 * (Cp / (J * (γ-1))) * ( (P2/P1)^((γ-1)/γ) - 1 )

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Alternatively, the enthalpy change can be used. For an ideal gas, the work per stage is the enthalpy change, which is Cp*(T2 - T1), but since it's isentropic, T2 would be higher.

Wait, but since the compression is isentropic, the temperature after compression (before cooling) can be found using the relation:

T2 = T1 * (P2 / P1)^((γ-1)/γ)

And then, since the gas is cooled back to T1 after each stage, the heat removed in each intercooler is the enthalpy change from T2 back to T1, which is Cp * (T2 - T1) per pound-mole.

Wait, but since we have three stages, each stage contributes some heat that's removed.

So for each stage, the heat removed would be Cp * (T2 - T1) multiplied by the number of moles.

But wait, the ethane flow rate is given in cubic feet per minute at standard conditions. I think standard conditions are 60°F and 14.7 psia, but perhaps for this problem, we can assume standard conditions to be 70°F and 11 psia? Hmm, perhaps not. Wait, the initial temperature is 70°F, so maybe that's the ambient temperature.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the number of moles per minute of ethane.

The flow rate is 200 cubic feet per minute at standard temperature and pressure, but wait, standard could be 60°F and 14.7 psia. Alternatively, perhaps the given conditions are 70°F and 11 psia. Hmm, the problem says the ethane is at 70°F, so the initial state is 11 psia and 70°F.

Wait, but standard cubic feet usually refers to 60°F and 14.7 psia. So to find the number of moles per minute, I can use the ideal gas equation.

PV = nRT

So n = PV/(RT)

But I need to make sure the units are consistent. Let's see, P is in psia, V in cubic feet, T in absolute degrees (Rankine), and R is the gas constant.

Wait, R for ethane can be calculated as R = 10.7316 psia·ft³/(lb-mol·R). Wait, no, the universal gas constant R is 10.7316 (psia·ft³)/(lb-mol·R), but I think I might have that wrong. Wait, the standard R is 10.7316 psi·ft³/(lb-mol·R). So yes, that's correct.

So, let's compute n for the ethane.

Given that V is 200 ft³/min, P is 11 psia, T is 70°F, which is 70 + 459.67 = 529.67 R.

So n = (P * V) / (R * T)

Plugging in the values:

n = (11 psia * 200 ft³/min) / (10.7316 psia·ft³/(lb-mol·R) * 529.67 R)

Calculate denominator: 10.7316 * 529.67 ≈ 10.7316 * 500 is about 5365.8, but precise calculation:

10.7316 * 529.67:

Let me compute 10 * 529.67 = 5296.7
0.7316 * 529.67 ≈ 0.7 * 529.67 = 370.77, 0.0316*529.67 ≈ 16.72 → total ≈ 370.77+16.72=387.49
So total denominator ≈ 5296.7 + 387.49 = 5684.19

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, wait: 10.7316 * 529.67 = ?

Well, 10 * 529.67 is 5296.7, 0.7 * 529.67 is 370.769, 0.0316 * 529.67 is approximately 16.72. So adding those:

5296.7 + 370.769 = 5667.469 + 16.72 ≈ 5684.189.

So denominator is 5684.189.

Numerator is 11 * 200 = 2200.

So n = 2200 / 5684.189 ≈ 0.387 lb-mol/min.

Wait, that seems low, but okay.

So each minute, 0.387 lb-mol of ethane is being compressed.

Now, for each stage, the compression ratio is about 4.49. So the first stage goes from 11 psia to 11 * 4.49 ≈ 49.39 psia.

The second stage from 49.39 to 49.39 * 4.49 ≈ 221.7 psia.

Third stage from 221.7 to 221.7 *4.49 ≈ 1000 psia. Hmm, 4.49^3 is 4.49 *4.49=20.16, 20.16*4.49≈90.5. Wait, 11 *90.5 is 995.5, close to 1000, so that's correct.

So each stage has a compression ratio of approximately 4.49.

Now, for each stage, the temperature after isentropic compression would be T2 = T1 * (P2/P1)^((γ-1)/γ)

Given γ is 1.22 for ethane.

So (γ-1)/γ = (0.22)/1.22 ≈ 0.1803.

So for each stage, T2 = T1 * (4.49)^0.1803

T1 is 70°F = 530 R (since 70 + 459.67 = 529.67, approx 530 R).

Compute (4.49)^0.1803.

Let me compute ln(4.49) ≈ 1.504

Multiply by 0.1803: 1.504 * 0.1803 ≈ 0.271.

Exponentiate: e^0.271 ≈ 1.311.

So T2 ≈ 530 R * 1.311 ≈ 530 *1.311 ≈ 695.1 R.

Then, after the intercooler, the gas is cooled back to 530 R, so the heat removed per stage is Cp * (T2 - T1) per lb-mol, multiplied by the number of lb-mol per minute.

Cp is given as 13.3 BTU/(lb-mol·R).

So per stage, the heat removed is 13.3 * (695.1 - 530) = 13.3 * 165.1 ≈ let's compute that.

13 *165=2145, 0.3*165=49.5 → 2194.5? Wait, no, wait: 13.3 *165.1 = ?

13 * 165.1 = 2146.3, 0.3 *165.1=49.53 → total 2146.3 +49.53=2195.83 BTU per lb-mol.

Wait, but wait, the units: per lb-mol, so per lb-mol, each stage removes 2195.83 BTU.

But we have 0.387 lb-mol per minute, so per stage, the heat removed is 0.387 * 2195.83 ≈ let's compute that.

0.3 *2195.83 ≈ 659, 0.08 *2195.83≈175.7, 0.007 *2195.83≈15.37. Sum: 659+175.7=834.7 +15.37=850.07 BTU/min per stage.

Wait, but each stage does that. So three stages would have 3 *850.07 ≈2550.2 BTU/min.

But wait, no, perhaps not exactly, because each stage's inlet pressure is higher, so the temperature rise might be slightly different, but since each stage has the same compression ratio, I think the T2 will be the same each time. So each stage adds the same heat, so yes, 3 stages, so 3 times.

Wait, no, wait. The first stage's inlet is 11 psia, and outlet is 49.39 psia. The second stage's inlet is 49.39 psia, so when you compress it by 4.49, the absolute pressure becomes higher, but the ratio is the same, so the temperature rise per stage is same.

So each stage contributes the same heat to be removed. So 3 stages, each removing about 850.07 BTU/min. So total heat removed is 3*850.07 ≈2550.2 BTU/min.

Wait, but wait, after the third stage, the gas is compressed to 1000 psia, and then goes through an aftercooler, which brings it back to 70°F. So the temperature after the third stage's compression is again T2 =530 R * (4.49)^0.1803 ≈695.1 R, as before. So the heat removed in the aftercooler is the same as in each intercooler, so that's another 850.07 BTU/min.

Wait, but wait, the aftercooler is after the third stage. So the total heat removal would be 3 intercoolers and one aftercooler? Or is the aftercooler considered as one of the stages?

Wait, the problem says it's a three-stage compressor with intercoolers and aftercooler. So each of the three stages has an intercooler, and then there's an aftercooler. Wait, no, perhaps each stage's discharge is cooled, so three intercoolers, and then after the final stage, an aftercooler. Wait, no, probably each interstage has an intercooler, so three intercoolers, and the aftercooler is the same as the third intercooler? Hmm, perhaps I need to clarify.

Wait, perhaps the three intercoolers are between the stages, and the aftercooler is after the third stage. So maybe four coolers in total. But I'm not sure. Hmm, the problem says "intercoolers and aftercooler," so perhaps three intercoolers (after each stage) and one aftercooler, making four, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, three stages with intercooling (so three intercoolers) and then a final aftercooler, making four coolers. But the way the problem is worded is a bit ambiguous.

Wait, wait, perhaps the three-stage compressor has three intercoolers, and then the aftercooler is the same as the third intercooler. Or maybe the aftercooler is an additional cooler. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think: each stage is compressed and then cooled back to 70°F. So for each of the three stages, the gas is cooled, meaning three intercoolers. Then, after the third stage, the gas is sent to the aftercooler to cool it again, but wait, no, because after each stage it's already cooled. So perhaps the aftercooler is only used once, after the last stage. Wait, but the problem says that after each stage, the gas is cooled back to 70°F, so intercoolers after each stage, and then the aftercooler after the last stage, which would be redundant unless the final discharge is further cooled. But the problem states that the compressed gas is brought to 70°F, so perhaps the aftercooler brings it to 70°F after the last stage.

Wait, perhaps each intercooler brings the gas back to 70°F, and the aftercooler does the same. So in that case, each stage's discharge is cooled from T2 to T1=70°F, so perhaps four coolers are involved. Hmm, maybe I'm getting this wrong. Alternatively, perhaps the three intercoolers are after each of the three stages, and the aftercooler is the same as the third intercooler.

Wait, perhaps for the purpose of this problem, each stage's heat removal is considered, so three stages, each contributing heat, making three times the heat removal. But then, the aftercooler would add another instance. But I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps the total heat to be removed is the sum of the heat from each compression stage, which is three, and then the aftercooler, which is another, making four. But that doesn't make sense because each stage is followed by cooling.

Wait, perhaps the aftercooler is included in the intercoolers. So for three stages, each has an intercooler, so three heat removals. So the total heat removal would be three times what I calculated earlier. So 3 * 850 ≈2550 BTU/min.

But wait, perhaps I should include the aftercooler as well, making it four, but that might complicate things. Let me re-read the problem statement.

The problem says: "Cooling water is used in the intercoolers and aftercooler to bring the compressed gas to 70°F." So the intercoolers are between stages, and the aftercooler is after the final stage. So each stage, including the third, has an intercooler, and then an aftercooler, but perhaps the aftercooler is the same as the third intercooler's function. Or perhaps it's in addition.

Wait, no, perhaps each intercooler is between stages, so three intercoolers for three stages, and then the aftercooler is after the third stage. So that would make four coolers. Hmm, but that complicates the calculation, because the third stage's discharge is at 1000 psia, and then the aftercooler would cool it again, but why?

Wait, perhaps the aftercooler is part of the system, so the gas is compressed in three stages, each followed by an intercooler, and then after the third stage, it goes through an aftercooler. So that's four cooling steps. But that doesn't make much sense because after the third intercooler, the gas is already at 70°F. Wait, perhaps the aftercooler is used to cool it further? No, the problem says that the gas is brought to 70°F in all cases. So perhaps the aftercooler is the same as the third intercooler, and the total heat removal is three times.

Alternatively, perhaps the aftercooler is an additional step beyond the third stage, but that would require knowing the final temperature. Wait, no, the problem states that the gas is brought to 70°F after each compression, so perhaps each stage's discharge is cooled to 70°F, making three heat removals, each equal in magnitude. So the total heat removed would be three times the per-stage heat removal.

Wait, but when I calculated per stage, the heat removed was about 850 BTU/min, so three stages would be 2550 BTU/min.

But then what about the aftercooler? Wait, perhaps the aftercooler is not needed because the third intercooler already brings it to 70°F. So maybe the total heat removal is just
