Okay, so I have this probability problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. It says, if I roll 5 standard 6-sided dice and multiply the numbers on each face, what's the probability that the result is a composite number? The options are given from A to J.

Hmm, okay, so first, I need to understand what a composite number is. I remember that a composite number is a positive integer that has at least one positive divisor other than 1 and itself. So, numbers like 4, 6, 8, etc., are composite. But numbers like 2, 3, 5 are primes, and 1 is neither prime nor composite.

Wait, the question is about the product of five dice. So each die can show a number between 1 and 6, and we multiply all five together. We need to find the probability that this product is a composite number.

Probability is usually calculated as the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, first, I should find the total number of possible outcomes when rolling five dice. Each die has 6 possibilities, so for five dice, it's 6^5. Let me calculate that. 6*6=36, 36*6=216, 216*6=1296, 1296*6=7776. So, total outcomes are 7776.

Now, the favorable outcomes are the cases where the product is a composite number. But sometimes, it's easier to calculate the probability of the complement event and subtract it from 1. The complement here would be the product not being composite, meaning it's either 1 or a prime number.

Wait, but wait. When is the product not composite? Well, the product can be 1 if all dice show 1. Because 1*1*1*1*1=1. Also, the product could be a prime number. How can the product of five dice be a prime? Because primes have only two factors, 1 and themselves.

So, for the product to be a prime number, exactly one of the dice must show a prime number (like 2,3,5), and all the others must show 1. Because if more than one die shows a number greater than 1, then the product would have more factors, making it composite. Also, if a die shows a 4, 6, etc., those are composite themselves, so their inclusion would make the product composite.

So, let's break this down. The cases where the product is not composite are:

1. All dice show 1: product is 1.
2. Exactly one die shows a prime (2,3,5), and the rest show 1: product is a prime.

So, I need to calculate the number of outcomes for these two cases and sum them, then subtract from the total to find the number of favorable (composite) outcomes.

First case: all dice are 1. There's only 1 outcome here.

Second case: exactly one die shows a prime, others show 1. How many ways can this happen?

Each die could be the one showing the prime. There are 5 dice, so 5 choices for which die shows the prime. For that one die, the possible primes are 2,3,5. So 3 options. The other four dice must show 1, so only 1 option each.

So the number of outcomes here is 5 (choices of die) * 3 (primes) * 1^4 (the rest) = 5*3=15.

Wait, but wait. Are there any other cases where the product is a prime? Let's think. Suppose two dice are primes, but that would make the product a product of two primes, which is composite. So no, the only way to get a prime product is when exactly one die is a prime and the rest are 1.

So the total non-composite products are 1 (from case 1) +15 (from case 2) =16 outcomes.

Therefore, the number of outcomes where the product is composite is total outcomes minus non-composite, which is 7776 -16=7760.

Wait, wait, wait. Wait a minute. Let me double-check this because I might have made a mistake. Let me recount the non-composite cases.

Case 1: all ones. Only 1 outcome.

Case 2: exactly one die shows a prime (2,3,5), others are 1. So 5 dice *3 primes =15. So yes, 16 total non-composite.

So the number of favorable (composite) outcomes is 7776-16=7760.

Then the probability is 7760 /7776. Let's simplify that fraction.

Divide numerator and denominator by 8: 7760/8 = 970, 7776/8=972. So 970/972. Hmm, wait, can we simplify further? Let's see. 970 and 972 have a common factor of 2: 485/486.

So the probability is 485/486.

Looking at the options, option J is 485/486.

Wait, but wait. Let me make sure I didn't miss any other cases where the product is not composite. For example, what if one of the dice is a 1 and others are primes? No, because if more than one die is a prime, the product is composite. Because, say, 2 and 3: 2*3=6, which is composite. So only when exactly one die is a prime and the others are 1, the product is prime.

Wait, but wait another thing. What about the die showing a 1 and another showing a 1. No, that's still 1. Only when all are 1, product is 1.

Wait, another thing: the product can also be 1 even if some dice are 1 but others are not. Wait, no. Because 1 multiplied by anything else is that anything else. So, if at least one die isn't 1, then the product can't be 1. So the only way the product is 1 is when all dice are 1. That's correct.

So, the non-composite products are 1 and the primes. So 16 outcomes.

Therefore, the probability of composite is 1 - (16/7776) = (7776-16)/7776 =7760/7776 = 485/486.

Looking back at the options, option J is 485/486, which matches.

To determine the probability that the product of rolling five standard 6-sided dice is a composite number, we first calculate the total number of possible outcomes. Each die has 6 faces, so for five dice, the total number of outcomes is:

\[
6^5 = 7776
\]

Next, we identify the cases where the product is **not** a composite number. A composite number has more than two positive divisors, so the product is either:

1. **1**: This occurs only when all five dice show 1. There is exactly 1 such outcome.
2. **A prime number**: For the product to be a prime number, exactly one die must show a prime number (2, 3, or 5), and the remaining four dice must show 1. There are 5 choices for which die shows the prime and 3 possible prime numbers (2, 3, 5). Thus, the number of such outcomes is:

\[
5 \times 3 = 15
\]

Adding these, the total number of non-composite outcomes is:

\[
1 + 15 = 16
\]

The number of outcomes where the product is composite is therefore:

\[
7776 - 16 = 7760
\]

The probability of the product being composite is:

\[
\frac{7760}{7776}
\]

Simplifying this fraction by dividing the numerator and denominator by 16:

\[
\frac{7760}{7776} = \frac{485}{486}
\]

Thus, the probability that the result is a composite number is:

\[
\boxed{J}
\]
