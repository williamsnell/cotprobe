Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about strategies to reduce aggressiveness in children. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which strategy would probably be least effective. The options are A through D. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Social skills training. I remember that social skills training teaches kids how to interact better, like sharing, cooperation, and communication. That should help reduce aggression because they learn to resolve conflicts without fighting. So this is probably an effective strategy, not the least effective.

Option B: Encouraging competitive sports and games. Wait, competitive sports are all about winning, right? Sometimes they can bring out aggression because kids might get frustrated or want to win at all costs. I think that might actually increase aggression rather than reduce it. Or does it depend on how it's structured? Maybe some studies say that competitive sports can sometimes lead to more aggression because of the emphasis on victory. So this might not be effective, possibly even counterproductive.

Option C: Exposure to a nonaggressive model. That sounds like a Bandura-style social learning approach. If kids see someone else acting non-aggressively and being reinforced for it, they might imitate that behavior. So exposure to a model who solves problems without aggression should help reduce it. That's probably effective, so not the least.

Option D: Opportunities for catharsis. Catharsis is the idea that expressing pent-up emotions, like anger, can reduce them. So maybe through play or talking about their feelings. But wait, I think some research suggests that catharsis might not work as intended. For example, playing aggressive video games might actually increase aggression because it's just rehearsing those behaviors. But if it's a constructive way, like talking or physical activity that isn't aggressive, maybe it helps. Hmm, I'm a bit confused on this point. Or maybe catharsis in the sense of letting it all out isn't effective. I think the catharsis hypothesis has been debated, and some studies say it doesn't reduce aggression. So maybe this isn't an effective strategy.

Wait, so the question is about which is least effective. So which one is the worst option.

Option B, encouraging competitive sports. If competitive sports make kids more aggressive, then this strategy would actually make things worse. So it's the least effective.

Option D, catharsis: If it's about letting out aggression, maybe it's not helpful. Like hitting a pillow might just practice hitting. So maybe that's not effective either. So which is worse between B and D?

Alternatively, maybe some studies say that competitive sports can sometimes reduce aggression if they teach teamwork and rules. But I'm not too sure. I think generally, promoting competition might not be the best way to reduce aggression.

So putting it together, the strategies that are likely effective are A and C. The least effective would be either B or D.

But the question is about which is least effective. I think B is worse because it encourages competition, which can promote winning at any cost, possibly leading to more aggression. D might not be effective either, but perhaps it's not as directly promoting aggression as B does.

So the least effective strategy is B: encouraging competitive sports and games.

The least effective strategy for reducing aggressiveness in children is likely **encouraging competitive sports and games**. Competitive environments often emphasize winning, which can foster frustration and aggression rather than reducing it. While social skills training (A) and exposure to nonaggressive models (C) are effective in teaching positive behaviors, and opportunities for catharsis (D) may have mixed results, competitive sports stand out as potentially counterproductive due to their focus on competition over cooperation. 

Answer: B
