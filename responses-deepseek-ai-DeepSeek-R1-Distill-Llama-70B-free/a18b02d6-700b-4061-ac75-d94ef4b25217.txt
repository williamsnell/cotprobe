Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question in front of me, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's see what the question is asking. The question is, "Which of the following statements is true?" and there are options from A to I.

Alright, let me start by going through each option one by one and evaluate them.

Option A: The demand for loanable funds consists of savers. Hmm. Wait, I remember that in economics, the loanable funds market is where savers and investors interact. Savers are suppliers because they save money, and investors are demanders because they borrow to invest. So if the demand for loanable funds is from investors, then A is incorrect because it says the demand consists of savers. So A is wrong.

Option B: Real GDP is the sum of the money supply and the velocity of money. Wait, I think the formula is something like MV = PQ, where M is money supply, V is velocity, P is price level, and Q is real GDP. So Real GDP would be (M*V)/P, not the sum. So B is incorrect.

Option C: The supply of loanable funds is solely determined by the central bank's policies. No, that doesn't sound right. The supply of loanable funds comes from savers, like households, and also from the central bank through monetary policy, but it's not solely determined by them. For example, when people save more, the supply increases. So C is false.

Option D: Dollars earned today have more purchasing power than dollars earned a year from today. Oh, I think this is about the time value of money. A dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future because of its potential earning capacity. So if you have a dollar now, you can invest it and have more in a year. So yes, D sounds correct. Wait, but I need to think about inflation. If there's inflation, then today's dollar can buy more than a future dollar which may be worth less. So that supports D as well. So D is correct.

Option E: The velocity of money is the speed at which the stock market indices change. No, velocity of money refers to how often each unit of money is used in transactions over a period. It's not related to stock market changes. So E is wrong.

Option F: The demand for loanable funds is entirely driven by government borrowing. No, the demand comes from both private investors (like businesses wanting to invest) and governments. So it's not entirely driven by government borrowing. F is incorrect.

Option G: Purchasing power parity ensures that dollars have the same value across all time periods. Purchasing power parity (PPP) is about exchange rates between countries, ensuring that goods have the same price in different currencies. It's more about spatial differences, not across time periods. So G is incorrect.

Option H: The supply of loanable funds consists of investors. Wait, no. Investors are the ones demanding funds. The supply comes from savers, like households and maybe central banks. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Inflation rates are inversely proportional to the velocity of money at all times. Hmm, from the equation MV = PQ, if M increases and V is constant, then P (price level) increases, leading to inflation. But V can vary. So if V increases, it can lead to higher inflation. So I don't think they are inversely proportional. Maybe when V goes up, inflation could go up, so they are directly related? So I is incorrect.

So after going through all options, the correct answer is D.

The correct answer is D. Dollars earned today have more purchasing power than dollars earned a year from today because of the time value of money and potential earning capacity, supported by considerations of inflation.

Answer: D
