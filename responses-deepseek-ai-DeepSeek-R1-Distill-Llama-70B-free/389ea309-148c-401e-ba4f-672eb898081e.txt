Question:

A state highway runs through the center of a city's business district. As the highway passes through this business district, there is a stretch where the highway is too narrow to satisfS' the safety standards for state roadways. Along this narrow stretch and on opposite sides of the street are located two businesses. Situated on the east side of the street is a bar and grill; directly across the street on the west side is a lounge. In order to comply with state highway regulations, the state highway department, acting pursuant to state statute, ordered the city to prohibit parking on one side of the highway within the business district. The city council convened a special meeting to determine whether parking should be prohibited on the east or west side of the street. During the meeting, the council was unable to resolve the issue. Finally, the city council president decided the only fair way to resolve the matter was to flip a coin. After the coin flip, the city prohibited parking at all times on the west side of the highway. On account of this decision, parking in front of the lounge was permanently prohibited. This caused the lounge to suffer a substantial decline in business because of the unavailability of on-street parking. As a consequence, the owner of the lounge brought suit for declarative relief against the city alleging that the parking ban on his side of the street was unconstitutional. In all likelihood, will the plaintiff be successful in this cause of action?

Options:

A: No, because as a governmental entity, the city enjoys immunity from such suits under the Eleventh Amendment.
B: No, because the city was acting in accordance with state highway safety regulations.
C: Yes, because the action of the city violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
D: No, because the city's action was reasonable.
E: Yes, because the city council failed to consider the economic impact of their decision on the lounge.
F: No, because the city council president's decision to flip a coin was arbitrary and capricious.
G: No, because the state highway department's order supersedes any claim by the lounge owner.
H: Yes, because the prohibition of parking constitutes a taking of property without just compensation.
I: Yes, because the city council's decision unfairly targeted businesses on the west side of the street.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question. Let me start by reading through the problem carefully.

So, there's a state highway that goes through a city's business district. The part where it's narrow doesn't meet safety standards, so the state highway department tells the city to prohibit parking on one side. The city council can't decide which side, so they flip a coin and choose the west side. This affects a lounge owner who sues, claiming it's unconstitutional.

The question is whether the plaintiff (the lounge owner) will win. So, I need to think about the legal issues here.

First, I remember that when the government takes action that affects businesses, they have to consider things like due process and equal protection under the Constitution. The Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause says that states can't deny any person equal protection of the laws.

In this case, the city chose one side over the other arbitrarily by flipping a coin. The bar and grill is on the east, and the lounge on the west. They both are similar businesses, but the parking ban was applied only to one side. So, the lounge owner might argue that this was unequal treatment.

I'm thinking about whether the city's action was reasonable. The city had a legitimate reason—complying with state highway safety standards. But the method they used to choose which side was arbitrary. Arbitrariness can sometimes lead to constitutional issues, especially if it's not based on rational reasoning.

I recall that in cases where the government's action affects fundamental rights or when a classification is based on a suspect category, the court applies strict scrutiny. But here, it's about economic interests, so rational basis might apply. However, even under rational basis, the law must be rationally related to a legitimate government interest.

Flipping a coin doesn't seem rational. It's random and doesn't consider any relevant factors. So, the city's decision might be seen as arbitrary and not based on a rational reason, which could mean it violates equal protection because similarly situated businesses are treated differently without a good reason.

Looking at the options:

A: No, because of Eleventh Amendment immunity. Wait, the Eleventh Amendment deals with state immunity from lawsuits in federal court, but the suit is against the city, which is a municipal entity. Plus, the question is about constitutionality, so maybe this isn't the right answer.

B: No, because the city was following state regulations. The state's order required prohibiting parking, but the choice of side was the city's. The city's method might be the issue, so B might not be correct.

C: Yes, because it violated equal protection. This seems possible because the decision was arbitrary and treated similar businesses unequally.

D: No, because the action was reasonable. But flipping a coin doesn't seem reasonable. So D might not be the right choice.

E: Yes, because they didn't consider economic impact. While considering economic impact is a factor, the main legal issue is equal protection, not failure to consider impact. So E might not be the best answer.

F: No, because the coin flip was arbitrary and capricious. This is a possibility. Arbitrary and capricious is more of an administrative law concept, like under the APA, but in constitutional terms, it's about equal protection.

G: No, because the state's order supersedes. The state ordered to prohibit parking, but the choice of side was the city's. So the state's order doesn't necessarily make the city's action immune.

H: Yes, because it's a taking without compensation. Prohibiting parking might be a regulatory action. For it to be a taking, it would have to go beyond regulation and actually take property, which might not be the case here. So H is less likely.

I: Yes, because it targeted west side businesses. This is similar to C, but I think equal protection (C) is a better fit.

So, putting it all together, the city's arbitrary decision to flip a coin led to unequal treatment of similarly situated businesses. This violates the Equal Protection Clause, so option C is the correct answer.
</think>

The city's decision to prohibit parking on one side of the highway was made by flipping a coin, which is an arbitrary method that does not provide a rational basis for the choice. This arbitrary decision resulted in unequal treatment of similarly situated businesses—the bar and grill on the east side and the lounge on the west side. Under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, such arbitrary and unequal treatment is unconstitutional because it lacks a rational relationship to a legitimate government interest. Therefore, the plaintiff is likely to succeed in their claim.

Answer: C
