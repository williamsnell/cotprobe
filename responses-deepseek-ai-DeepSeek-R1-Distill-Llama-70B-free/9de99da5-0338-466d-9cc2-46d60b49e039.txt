Question:

This question refers to the following information.
I am of opinion that the principal and true profession of the Courtier ought to be that of arms; which I would have him follow actively above all else, and be known among others as bold and strong, and loyal to whomsoever he serves. . . .
I would have him well built and shapely of limb, and would have him show strength and lightness and suppleness, and know all bodily exercises that befit a man of war; whereof I think the first should be to handle every sort of weapon well on foot and on horse, to understand the advantages of each, and especially to be familiar with those weapons that are ordinarily used among gentlemen. . . .
Our Courtier then will be esteemed excellent and will attain grace in everything, particularly in speaking. . . .
I would have him more than passably accomplished in letters, at least in those studies that are called the humanities, and conversant not only with the Latin language but with the Greek, for the sake of the many different things that have been admirably written therein. Let him be well versed in the poets, and not less in the orators and historians, and also proficient in writing verse and prose, especially in this vulgar [vernacular] tongue of ours. . . .
You must know that I am not content with the Courtier unless he be also a musician and unless, besides understanding and being able to read notes, he can play upon divers instruments. . . .
I wish our Courtier to guard against getting the name of a liar or a boaster, which sometimes befalls even those who do not deserve it.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which skill Castiglione recommends for a courtier that would be valued the least by a European gentleman at the end of the 20th century. Let's break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the passage from Castiglione's Book of the Courtier. He lists several qualities and skills that an ideal courtier should have. The options given are A through J, each representing a different skill or trait.

Castiglione mentions that the courtier's principal profession should be arms, so he should be skilled in handling weapons on foot and horse. That's option A and I. He also values being well-built and strong, which is option J. Additionally, he should be accomplished in letters, knowing Latin and Greek, and be familiar with poets, orators, and historians. That's options B, F, and H. Musical proficiency is another key point, which is option E. Being loyal, bold, and strong is G. Guarding against being a liar or boaster is C. And being strong and attractive is D.

Now, the question is about which of these would be least valued in the late 20th century. Let's consider each option in the context of modern values.

In the 16th century, martial skills were crucial because noblemen often had to fight. But by the end of the 20th century, society had changed a lot. Most European gentlemen wouldn't need to handle weapons as part of their daily life or professional duties. So skills like handling weapons on foot and horse (A and I) might be less relevant.

However, other skills like being multilingual (B), well-read in literature (F, H), or musical (E) are still highly valued today. Traits like loyalty (G), honesty (C), and physical fitness (D, J) also remain important.

So the least valued would probably be the martial skills, specifically handling weapons. Looking at the options, both A and I relate to weapons. Option A says "every sort of weapon well on foot and on horse," while I is "expertise with many kinds of weapons." So both are similar, but the question asks for the least valued. I think in modern times, being proficient with various weapons isn't as important as it was in the Renaissance. Other skills like languages, honesty, and cultural knowledge are more applicable.

Wait, but looking again, option A specifically mentions handling weapons on foot and on horse. That seems more specialized and less likely to be needed today. Option I is broader, about many kinds of weapons, but even that might be less relevant. So which one is the correct answer?

The question asks which would be valued least, so perhaps the more specific and outdated skill. Handling weapons on horseback isn't something modern gentlemen would need, so option A might be the least valued. Alternatively, option I is about expertise with many weapons, which might also be less relevant, but perhaps more so than A.

Wait, but the options are A and I. The question is about the least valued, so I think the specific martial skill of handling weapons on foot and horse would be less applicable today than, say, just knowing how to use weapons in general. But perhaps even knowing many kinds of weapons isn't as relevant. Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, looking back, the passage says the principal profession is arms, so handling weapons is a big part. But in modern times, that's not a primary skill for gentlemen. So which option between A and I is the better answer? The question is phrased as which skill would be valued least, so the specific one about handling on foot and horse (A) might be more outdated. Alternatively, perhaps the broader expertise (I) is still somewhat valued, like in hobbies or sports, but handling on horseback is less so.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is A because it's more specific to a bygone era, while I is more general. So I think the answer is A.

The question asks which skill recommended by Castiglione for a courtier would be valued least by a European gentleman at the end of the 20th century. Castiglione emphasizes martial skills, such as handling weapons on foot and on horse, as central to the courtier's role. However, by the late 20th century, societal changes made such skills less relevant. While other skills like language proficiency, literacy, and honesty remain valuable, martial skills like handling weapons on foot and on horse (option A) are more specific to the Renaissance context and less applicable in modern times. Therefore, this skill would be the least valued.

Answer: A
