Okay, so I have this problem where Jackson and Co. are buying electric blankets for $18.75 each, and they want a markup of 40% on the cost. I need to find the selling price. Hmm, let me think about how markup works.

Wait, markup is usually based on the cost price, right? So if the cost is $18.75 and they want a 40% markup, that means they're adding 40% of the cost to the cost itself to get the selling price. So the formula should be selling price = cost + (markup percentage * cost). 

Alternatively, I remember that markup can also be calculated as selling price = cost * (1 + markup percentage). Oh right, because 40% markup means you're multiplying the cost by 1.4. Let me do the math.

So $18.75 multiplied by 1.4. Let me calculate that. Let's see, 18.75 times 1 is 18.75, and 18.75 times 0.4 is... well, 18.75 * 0.4. Let me break it down. 10 * 0.4 is 4, 8 * 0.4 is 3.2, 0.75 * 0.4 is 0.3. So adding those: 4 + 3.2 is 7.2, plus 0.3 is 7.5. So 18.75 + 7.5 equals 26.25. So the selling price should be $26.25.

Looking at the options, option G is $26.25. So that's the answer. Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Did I confuse markup with margin? Wait, markup is on cost, so yes, 40% of 18.75 is indeed 7.5, added to get 26.25. Yep, that makes sense.

The selling price is calculated by applying a 40% markup to the cost price of $18.75. Using the formula for markup:

\[
\text{Selling Price} = \text{Cost} \times (1 + \text{Markup Percentage})
\]

\[
\text{Selling Price} = 18.75 \times 1.4 = 26.25
\]

Thus, the selling price is $26.25, which corresponds to option G.
