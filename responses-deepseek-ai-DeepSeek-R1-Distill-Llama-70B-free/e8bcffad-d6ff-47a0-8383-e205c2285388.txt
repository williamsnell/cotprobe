Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the average density of a rod. Hmm, let's see. The rod is 8 meters long, and the linear density is given by 12 divided by the square root of (x plus 1) kg/m. Oh right, linear density is like how mass per unit length varies along the rod. To find the average density, I remember that I need to integrate the linear density over the length of the rod and then divide by the total length.

Wait, so the formula for average density (average linear density) should be (1/L) times the integral from 0 to L of the density function dx. Right, because density varies with position, so we have to average it over the entire length.

So here, L is 8 meters. The density function is 12 / sqrt(x + 1). So I need to compute the integral of 12/(sqrt(x+1)) dx from x=0 to x=8, then divide by 8.

Let me think about integrating 12/(sqrt(x+1)). Oh, right, the integral of 1/sqrt(x) is 2*sqrt(x) + C. So if I have 12 times that integral, it should be straightforward.

Wait, let's write this step by step. The integral from 0 to 8 of 12/(sqrt(x+1)) dx. Let me make a substitution to make it easier. Let u = x + 1, then du = dx. So when x is 0, u is 1, and when x is 8, u is 9.

So the integral becomes 12 * integral from u=1 to u=9 of 1/sqrt(u) du. The integral of 1/sqrt(u) is 2*sqrt(u). So evaluating from 1 to 9:

12 * [2*sqrt(9) - 2*sqrt(1)] = 12 * [2*3 - 2*1] = 12 * [6-2] = 12 *4 =48.

Wait wait, that doesn't sound right. Wait, because 2*sqrt(9) is 6, 2*sqrt(1) is 2, so 6-2 is 4, multiplied by 12 gives 48. So the total mass is 48 kg? Or wait, no, wait. Wait, no. Wait, linear density is kg/m, so the integral gives kg because integrating kg/m over m gives kg. So that's the total mass. But average density is total mass divided by total length.

So average density is total mass (48 kg) divided by length (8 m) = 6 kg/m.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the integral. Let me compute it again. The integral of 1/sqrt(x+1) dx from 0 to8.

Let me change variable: let u = x+1, so x= u-1, du=dx. When x=0, u=1; x=8, u=9.

Integral becomes âˆ«(u=1 to 9) [12 / sqrt(u)] du.

Which is 12 * [2 sqrt(u)] from 1 to9.

So 12 * [2*(3) - 2*(1)] = 12*(6-2)=12*4=48.

Total mass is 48 kg. Length is 8m. So average density is 48/8=6 kg/m.

Looking back at the options, option I is 6 kg/m. So the answer should be I.

To find the average density of the rod, we start by noting that the linear density is given as \( \frac{12}{\sqrt{x+1}} \, \mathrm{kg/m} \), where \( x \) is measured in meters from one end of the rod. The rod is 8 meters long. The average density is calculated by integrating the linear density over the length of the rod and then dividing by the total length.

The formula for average density is:

\[
\text{Average Density} = \frac{1}{L} \int_0^L \rho(x) \, dx
\]

Here, \( L = 8 \, \mathrm{m} \) and \( \rho(x) = \frac{12}{\sqrt{x+1}} \). Substituting these values, we compute:

\[
\text{Average Density} = \frac{1}{8} \int_0^8 \frac{12}{\sqrt{x+1}} \, dx
\]

To evaluate the integral, we use the substitution \( u = x + 1 \), so \( du = dx \). When \( x = 0 \), \( u = 1 \), and when \( x = 8 \), \( u = 9 \). The integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^8 \frac{12}{\sqrt{x+1}} \, dx = 12 \int_1^9 \frac{1}{\sqrt{u}} \, du
\]

The integral of \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{u}} \) is \( 2\sqrt{u} \). Evaluating this from \( u = 1 \) to \( u = 9 \):

\[
12 \left[ 2\sqrt{u} \right]_1^9 = 12 \left[ 2\sqrt{9} - 2\sqrt{1} \right] = 12 \left[ 6 - 2 \right] = 12 \cdot 4 = 48
\]

This result represents the total mass of the rod. To find the average density, divide the total mass by the length of the rod:

\[
\text{Average Density} = \frac{48}{8} = 6 \, \mathrm{kg/m}
\]

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**I: 6 kg/m**
