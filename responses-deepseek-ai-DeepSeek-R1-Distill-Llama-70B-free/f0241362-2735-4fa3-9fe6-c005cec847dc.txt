Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the molar weight of a protein based on osmotic pressure. Hmm, I remember that osmotic pressure is related to molarity, right? Oh wait, the formula is π = iMRT. Yeah, something like that. Let me think.

So the given data is: mass of protein is 3.85 grams, volume is 250 ml, osmotic pressure π is 10.4 mm Hg, and temperature is 30°C. Oh wait, temperature in Kelvin would be 30 + 273.15, which is 303.15 K. Right.

I need to find the molar weight, so the formula rearranged would be M = (π * V) / (n * R * T). Wait, but n is moles, which is mass divided by molar weight. Wait, no, let me think again.

Another approach: Osmotic pressure π is equal to (n/V)RT, where n is moles of solute. So to find n/V, which is molarity, it's π/(RT). Once I have that, molarity is moles per liter. Then, since I have the mass, I can find the molar weight.

Let me break it down step by step.

First, calculate π in the correct units. The given π is 10.4 mm Hg. I think standard pressure is in atmospheres. Oh right, 1 atm is about 760 mm Hg. So 10.4 mm Hg is 10.4 / 760 atm. Let me calculate that. 10.4 divided by 760. Let's see, 10.4 /760 is... 760 is 76*10, so 10.4 is 0.01368 atm. Wait, 10.4 divided by 760: 760/10 is 76, so 10.4 /760 = 0.01368 atm.

Next, R is the gas constant. I think R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K.

Temperature T is 30°C, which is 303.15 K.

So π = iMRT. Since it's a protein, which I assume doesn't dissociate much, i is probably 1, so we can ignore it.

So M = π/(RT). Let's plug in the numbers.

M = (0.01368 atm) / (0.0821 L·atm/mol·K * 303.15 K)

Calculating the denominator: 0.0821 * 303.15. Let's compute that.

0.0821 * 300 is 24.63, and 0.0821 * 3.15 is about 0.2589. So total is approx 24.63 + 0.2589 = 24.8889.

So denominator is about 24.8889. Then M = 0.01368 / 24.8889.

Let me compute that. 0.01368 / 24.8889 ≈ 0.00055 mol/L. Wait, that seems really low, but maybe that's correct because proteins are large.

Wait, but wait a second. The volume given is 250 ml, which is 0.25 liters. So the solution is 0.25 L. So the number of moles in the solution is Molarity * Volume = 0.00055 mol/L * 0.25 L = 0.0001375 mol.

Wait, but the mass of the protein is 3.85 grams. So molar weight M is mass divided by moles: 3.85 g / 0.0001375 mol.

Let me calculate that. 3.85 / 0.0001375. Hmm, let's see. 3.85 / 0.0001375 = 3.85 / (1.375e-4) )= 3.85 * (1e4/1.375) )= 3.85 * 72.727... ≈ 279.55 g/mol.

Wait, so around 280 grams per mole. Let me check the options. Option A is 27900 g/mol. Oh wait, wait, wait! I think I made a mistake. I must have messed up the calculation somewhere.

Wait, let me recalculate the Molarity step. Hmm, π = iMRT → M = π/(iRT).

Wait, π is 10.4 mm Hg. Oh wait, wait, wait, I think I messed up the conversion. Because 1 atm is 760 mm Hg, so 10.4 mm Hg is 10.4 /760 atm = 0.013684 atm.

So M = (0.013684 atm) / (0.0821 * 303.15) → let me compute the denominator again.

0.0821 * 303.15 = let's compute it exact: 303.15 * 0.0821.

303 * 0.08 = 24.24, 0.0821 is 0.08 +0.0021.

303.15 * 0.0021 = 0.636915. So 24.24 + (303.15 *0.0021)= 24.24 + 0.636915=24.876915.

So denominator is approximately 24.8769.

So M = 0.013684 / 24.8769 ≈ 0.00055 mol/L, same as before.

Then, number of moles is M * V → V is 0.25 L, so 0.00055 * 0.25 = 0.0001375 mol.

Mass is 3.85 grams, so molar weight = 3.85 / 0.0001375 → let's compute that.

3.85 divided by 0.0001375.

3.85 / 0.0001375 = 3.85 / (1.375e-4) ) = (3.85 * 1e4) / 1.375.

3.85 * 1e4 = 38500.

38500 / 1.375 → Let's compute that.

1.375 is 11/8, so 38500 * (8/11) = (38500 *8)/11.

38500 *8 = 308000.

308000 /11 → 308000 ÷11 is approximately 27909.09... So about 27909 g/mol.

Looking at the options, option A is 27900, which is the closest. So the answer should be A: 27900 g/mol.

Wait, but wait a second. I think I may have made a mistake in the calculation. Let me double-check.

Wait, 3.85 grams divided by moles (0.0001375) is indeed the molar mass.

3.85 / 0.0001375 = 3.85 / 0.0001375 = 3.85 * (1 / 0.0001375) = 3.85 * approx 7272.73.

Wait, 1/0.0001375 = 1 ÷ 0.0001375 = 7272.727 approximately.

So 3.85 *7272.727 = let's compute that.

3 *7272.727 is 21818.18, and 0.85 *7272.727 is about 6183.167. Summing gives 21818.18 +6183.167= 279,  21818 +6183 is 28001? Wait, wait, no, 21818 +6183 is 28001? Wait, 21818+6183: 21818+6000=27818, plus 183 is 279,  21818+6183=28001? Wait, 21818+6000=27818, plus 183 makes 27818+183=28001. Hmm, but wait, 7272.727 *3.85 = ?

Let me compute 7272.727 *3 = 21818.181.

7272.727 *0.85 = let's see, 7272.727 *0.8 is 5818.1816, and 7272.727 *0.05 is 363.63635. So 5818.1816 +363.63635=6181.81795.

Adding to 21818.181 gives 21818.181 +6181.81795=28000.  So yes, approximately 28000 g/mol.

So option A is 27900, which is very close. So the correct answer should be A.

To determine the molar weight of the protein, we use the relationship between osmotic pressure and molarity, given by the formula:

\[
\pi = iMRT
\]

Where:
- \(\pi\) is the osmotic pressure,
- \(i\) is the van't Hoff factor (assumed to be 1 for this protein),
- \(M\) is the molarity (\(n/V\)),
- \(R\) is the gas constant (\(0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)}\)),
- \(T\) is the temperature in Kelvin.

### Step 1: Convert osmotic pressure to atm
The given osmotic pressure is \(10.4 \, \text{mm Hg}\). Since \(1 \, \text{atm} = 760 \, \text{mm Hg}\), we convert:

\[
\pi = \frac{10.4}{760} \, \text{atm} = 0.01368 \, \text{atm}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate molarity (\(M\))
Rearranging the formula for molarity:

\[
M = \frac{\pi}{RT}.
\]

Substitute the values:
- \(\pi = 0.01368 \, \text{atm}\),
- \(R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)}\),
- \(T = 30^\circ \text{C} + 273.15 = 303.15 \, \text{K}\).

\[
M = \frac{0.01368}{0.0821 \times 303.15}.
\]

First, calculate the denominator:

\[
0.0821 \times 303.15 = 24.8889.
\]

Now, calculate \(M\):

\[
M = \frac{0.01368}{24.8889} \approx 0.00055 \, \text{mol/L}.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate moles of solute (\(n\))
The volume of the solution is \(250 \, \text{mL} = 0.25 \, \text{L}\). The number of moles is:

\[
n = M \times V = 0.00055 \times 0.25 = 0.0001375 \, \text{mol}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculate molar weight (\(M_w\))
The mass of the protein is \(3.85 \, \text{g}\). The molar weight is:

\[
M_w = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{moles}} = \frac{3.85}{0.0001375}.
\]

Perform the division:

\[
M_w = 3.85 \div 0.0001375 = 27,909.09 \, \text{g/mol}.
\]

### Step 5: Match with the closest option
The calculated molar weight is approximately \(27,909 \, \text{g/mol}\), which is closest to option **A: 27,900 g/mol**.
