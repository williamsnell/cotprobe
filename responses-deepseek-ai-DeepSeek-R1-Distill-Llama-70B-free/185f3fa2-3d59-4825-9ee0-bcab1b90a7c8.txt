Question:

A defendant was convicted of assault of a federal officer and imprisoned in a federal penitentiary. While in prison, federal authorities began investigating the murder of the defendant's 11-year- old stepdaughter who was murdered two years earlier. Believing that the defendant was responsible for this killing, federal agents decided to plant an informant at the prison to befriend the defendant and possibly obtain evidence about the crime. In accord with this plan, the federal agents hired a paid informant and placed him in the prison as a fellow inmate, masquerading as an organized crime figure. The informant soon befriended the defendant and learned that he was being threatened by other inmates because of a rumor that he had killed a child. The informant then raised the subject in several conversations, but the defendant repeatedly denied any such involvement. After the defendant started receiving tough treatment from other inmates because of the rumor, the informant offered to protect the defendant but told him, "You have to tell me the truth about what really happened you know, if you want me to help you. " Believing that the informant would protect him from the other inmates, the defendant then admitted to the informant that he had driven his stepdaughter to the desert where he killed her. Based upon this confession, the defendant was then indicted for the first-degree murder of his stepdaughter. Prior to trial, the defendant moves to suppress the statement given to the informant. Should the defendant's motion be granted?

Options:

A: Yes, because the informant was acting as an agent of the government in a deceptive manner.
B: No, because under the totality of circumstances, the informant's conduct was not inherently coercive.
C: Yes, because the informant was a false friend, and the defendant was tricked into making the confession.
D: No, because the confession was made to a fellow inmate, not to a law enforcement official.
E: Yes, because the defendant was not read his Miranda rights before confessing to the informant.
F: Yes, because the confession was coerced by the threat of physical violence, absent protection from the informant that motivated the defendant to confess.
G: No, because the defendant was not under direct questioning by law enforcement at the time of the confession.
H: No, because the confession was voluntary.
I: No, because the defendant was already convicted of a crime and thus lost his right to avoid self-incrimination.
J: No, because the defendant's safety in prison was not the responsibility of the informant.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here about whether a defendant's motion to suppress a confession should be granted. Hmm, let me try to break this down.

Alright, the defendant was convicted of assaulting a federal officer and is in a federal prison. Then, federal agents started investigating the murder of his 11-year-old stepdaughter who was killed two years earlier. They thought he did it. So, they planted an informant in the prison to befriend him and get evidence. The informant posed as an organized crime figure. 

The informant became friends with the defendant and found out that other inmates were threatening him because of rumors he killed a child. The informant brought up the subject in conversations, but the defendant denied it. Then, when the defendant was getting tough treatment, the informant offered to protect him but said, "You have to tell me the truth about what really happened if you want me to help you." The defendant then confessed to the informant, saying he drove his stepdaughter to the desert and killed her. Now, he's indicted for first-degree murder and moves to suppress the statement.

So, the question is whether the motion should be granted. The options are A through J.

I remember that Miranda rights come into play when a person is in custody and being interrogated. But here, the defendant was talking to an informant, not a law enforcement officer. So Miranda might not apply because the informant isn't a state actor in that direct questioning sense. Wait, but the informant was acting on behalf of the government, so maybe it's a different situation.

Another angle is the voluntariness of the confession. If the confession was coerced, it would be inadmissible. The informant offered protection in exchange for the truth. The defendant felt threatened by other inmates, so he might have felt pressured to confess to get the informant's protection. That could be seen as coercive.

But I think the courts have held that using informants doesn't necessarily make a confession involuntary if the informant isn't directly threatening or using coercive tactics beyond what's inherent in the situation. Like, in Hoffa v. United States, the Supreme Court said that the use of an informant doesn't violate the Fourth Amendment or the Sixth Amendment unless there's some kind of coercion or intrusion.

In this case, the informant didn't directly threaten the defendant beyond offering protection. The defendant was already under threat from other inmates because of the rumor. So the informant's offer of protection might not add enough coercion to make the confession involuntary. The court might look at the totality of the circumstances.

Wait, but the defendant was in a prison environment, which is inherently coercive. The threat of violence from other inmates could make him more susceptible to pressure. But the informant's offer was to protect him, which might be seen as a benefit. So, does that make the confession voluntary or not?

I think the key issue is whether the government's actions created a situation where the defendant's will was overborne. If the informant was just offering protection without making threats, maybe it's not coercive. But the fact that the government placed the informant there to trick him might be deceptive, but deception alone doesn't necessarily make a confession inadmissible unless it's so coercive that it violates due process.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Yes, because the informant was an agent of the government acting deceptively. But I think deception isn't enough on its own.

Option B: No, because under totality of circumstances, not inherently coercive. That might be the case.

Option C: Yes, because the informant was a false friend. But again, being a false friend doesn't automatically make it coercive.

Option D: No, because it was a fellow inmate. But the informant was a government agent, so that might not matter.

Option E: Yes, because Miranda rights weren't read. But since the informant isn't a law enforcement officer, Miranda doesn't apply here.

Option F: Yes, because coercion from threat of violence. The informant's offer could be seen as a form of pressure, but it's more about the existing threats from other inmates. Maybe the defendant felt he had no choice but to confess to get protection. That could be coercion.

Option G: No, because not direct questioning by law enforcement. That's true, but the government's informant might still have been acting in a way that constitutes interrogation.

Option H: No, because the confession was voluntary. It depends on whether the circumstances made it voluntary or not.

Option I: No, because he was already convicted. But the right against self-incrimination applies regardless of prior convictions.

Option J: No, because the informant wasn't responsible for his safety. That doesn't directly address the voluntariness.

So, thinking through, the main points are whether the confession was voluntary and whether Miranda applies. Since Miranda doesn't apply because it's an informant, the issue is voluntariness. The government's actions through the informant could be seen as creating a situation of coercion, especially since the defendant was under threat and the offer of protection was conditioned on telling the truth. But courts often look at whether the government's actions were the proximate cause of the coercion. Here, the informant didn't threaten him beyond offering protection, which might not be enough to make it involuntary.

Wait, but in some cases, offering protection in exchange for information can be seen as a form of inducement. If the defendant reasonably believed that without the confession, he wouldn't get protection and would be harmed, that could make the confession not voluntary.

But I'm not sure. The Supreme Court has held that police activity that creates a coercive situation can lead to suppression, but here the government's agent didn't directly threaten; they just offered help. So maybe it's not coercive enough.

Therefore, the motion might not be granted because the confession was voluntary under the totality of circumstances. So the answer would be B or H.

Looking at the options, option B says no because under the totality, it's not inherently coercive. Option H says no because it's voluntary.

I think the better answer is B because it's about the totality of circumstances not being coercive. Alternatively, H could be correct because it's about voluntariness.

Wait, but the informant's offer of protection in exchange for the confession could be seen as an inducement. However, courts have held that such inducements don't necessarily make a confession involuntary unless they are so great as to overbear the will. In this case, the offer of protection from prison violence might be significant, but it's not clear if it's enough to make the confession involuntary.

I think the correct answer is B: No, because under the totality of circumstances, the conduct wasn't inherently coercive.

The question revolves around whether the defendant's confession to an informant should be suppressed. The defendant, while in prison, was befriended by an informant posing as an organized crime figure. The informant, acting on behalf of federal agents, offered protection from other inmates in exchange for the truth about the murder. The defendant confessed, and the issue is whether this confession was voluntary or coerced.

Key considerations include:

1. **Miranda Rights**: Miranda warnings are not required because the informant is not a law enforcement officer directly interrogating the defendant. Thus, the absence of Miranda warnings does not render the confession inadmissible.

2. **Voluntariness**: The critical issue is whether the confession was voluntary. Courts examine the totality of circumstances to determine if government actions created a coercive environment. Here, the informant offered protection in exchange for the truth, but this did not involve direct threats or overt coercion. The defendant was already facing threats from other inmates due to rumors, but the informant’s offer of protection does not inherently rise to the level of coercion that would render the confession involuntary.

3. **Government Deception**: While the informant was deceptive in posing as a fellow inmate, deception alone does not make a confession inadmissible unless it creates a coercive environment. In this case, the informant’s actions were not inherently coercive.

4. **Totality of Circumstances**: Under the totality of circumstances, the informant’s conduct—offering protection in exchange for information—does not constitute coercion. The defendant’s confession, while potentially influenced by the desire for safety, was not compelled by overtly coercive government actions.

Given these considerations, the confession was voluntary under the totality of circumstances, and the motion to suppress should not be granted.
