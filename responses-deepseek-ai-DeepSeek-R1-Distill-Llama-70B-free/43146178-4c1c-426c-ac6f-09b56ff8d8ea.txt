Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with entropy and ideal gas mixtures. But I'll take it step by step.

The problem is about an ideal gas mixture of oxygen and nitrogen. The conditions are given, and there are two parts: part (a) asks for the entropy of the mixture, and part (b) is about changes when cooling the mixture. The options are labeled A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, let's understand the problem setup. The mixture has 1 mole of oxygen and I think the question says 1 mole of nitrogen. Wait, no, looking again: "1 mole of oxygen and moles of nitrogen"—wait, that can't be right. Oh, maybe it's a typo. Looking again, the question says "1 mole of oxygen and moles of nitrogen"—hmm, probably it's 1 mole each. Or maybe I'm missing something. Wait, the question says "1 mole of oxygen and moles of nitrogen." Hmm, that seems ambiguous. Oh wait, maybe it's 1 mole of each. Because sometimes when the number is not specified, it's considered similar. Alternatively, perhaps it's 1 mole of O2 and another number. Wait, the original question might have a typo. Let me read it again: "An ideal gas mixture consists of 1 mole of oxygen and moles of nitrogen at 90°F and 13.5psia." Hmm, maybe it's 1 mole each? Or maybe the nitrogen is a different number, but I think perhaps it's 1 mole each. Or maybe I should check the units. Alternatively, perhaps the nitrogen is 1 mole as well, making a total of 2 moles. I'll proceed under that assumption unless something else comes up.

Wait, looking at the options, the entropy values are around 7 to 10 Btu/°R. Considering each gas contributes, maybe each is 1 mole.

So, for part (a), we need to compute the entropy of the mixture when each gas's datum state is zero at 14.7 psia and 0°F.

I remember that for ideal gases, the entropy change can be calculated using the formula:

ΔS = n Cp ln(T2/T1) - n R ln(P2/P1)

But wait, actually, the formula for the entropy change when changing from a reference state (where S=0) is:

S = n [ Cp ln(T/T_ref) - R ln(P/P_ref) ] + S_ref

But since S_ref is zero, that's the formula.

Wait, but wait, the entropy of an ideal gas can be considered as the sum of two contributions: one due to temperature change and another due to pressure change, relative to the datum state.

Wait, but I think for each gas in the mixture, the entropy is calculated as if it exists at the mixture's temperature and pressure, but considering it as a pure gas. Because in a mixture, each gas behaves as if it's in its partial pressure.

So for each constituent, the entropy is calculated based on its partial pressure.

Wait, the general formula for the entropy of an ideal gas in a mixture is:

S = n [ C_p^o ln(T/T_ref) - R ln(P_i / P_ref) ]

Where P_i is the partial pressure of the gas in the mixture.

So for each gas:

S = n [ Cp ln(T/T_ref) - R ln(P_i / P_ref) ]

But wait, wait. Another approach is to compute the entropy as if the gas went from the reference state (T_ref, P_ref) to the mixture's T and its partial pressure P_i.

Alternatively, another formula I've seen is:

s = s^o (T) - R ln(P / P_ref)

But that's for the specific entropy. Hmm.

Wait, the entropy change for an ideal gas can be calculated as:

ΔS = n Cp ln(T2 / T1) - n R ln(P2 / P1)

But when the initial state is the reference state (T_ref, P_ref), then S = n [ Cp ln(T/T_ref) ) - R ln(P/P_ref) ]

But wait, is that correct? Because the entropy change formula is:

ΔS = n Cp ln(T2/T1) - n R ln(P2/P1)

If the initial state is T_ref and P_ref, then yes, S_final = n Cp ln(T_final/T_ref) - n R ln(P_final/P_ref)

But wait, for the mixture, each gas's pressure is its partial pressure, not the total pressure. So for each component, the relevant pressure is P_i = (n_i / n_total) * P_total.

Wait, no. The partial pressure P_i is given by mole fraction * total pressure.

So for each gas, P_i = y_i * P_total, where y_i is the mole fraction.

So for the entropy calculation of each gas, we use the partial pressure as P_i.

So let me proceed.

Given:

Mixture: 1 mole O2, 1 mole N2 (assuming that, but I'm not 100% sure). Let me proceed with that for now.

So n_total = 2 moles.

T = 90°F. Convert to absolute temperature. Since entropy calculations use absolute temperature, I'll convert to Rankine.

T_initial = 90°F = 90 + 459.67 = 549.67 °R.

P = 13.5 psia.

The reference state is 14.7 psia and 0°F (459.67 °R).

So for each gas:

Compute S = n [ Cp ln(T/T_ref) - R ln(P_i / P_ref) ]

Wait, but which heat capacity? Because the formula uses Cp when pressure is constant. Alternatively, some sources use Cv, but I think when the process involves changing pressure at constant pressure, Cp is used.

Wait, no, the entropy change formula is:

ΔS = n Cp ln(T2/T1) - n R ln(P2/P1)

Because for ideal gases, the entropy change when changing T and P is given by that expression, regardless of the process. So yes, Cp is used.

So for each gas, the entropy is:

S = n [ Cp ln(T/T_ref) - R ln(P_i / P_ref) ]

Because the initial state is (T_ref, P_ref), and the final state is (T, P_i).

Wait, but wait: for each gas, the pressure in the mixture is its partial pressure. So for each component, the relevant pressure is P_i = (n_i / n_total) * P_total.

Given that, for each gas:

P_i = (n_i / n_total) * P.

So for O2 and N2, each is 1 mole, so n_i is 1, n_total is 2. So each P_i = (1/2) * 13.5 psia = 6.75 psia.

Wait, no, wait: the mole fraction y_i is n_i / n_total. So for each, y_O2 = y_N2 = 0.5.

So P_i for O2 is y_O2 * P_total = 0.5 * 13.5 = 6.75 psia.

Same for N2.

So for each gas, P_i is 6.75 psia.

So now, for each gas:

Compute S = n [ Cp ln(T / T_ref) - R ln(P_i / P_ref) ]

n is 1 mole for each.

T is 549.67 °R.

T_ref is 0°F = 459.67 °R.

P_ref is 14.7 psia.

So for O2:

Cp is given as 7.01 Btu/lbmol·°R. Wait, but wait! Wait, the units. Because in the problem statement, the options are in Btu/°R. So the entropy will be in Btu/°R.

But wait, since R is in (psia·ft³)/(lbmol·°R), but maybe I need to convert units. Hmm.

Wait, the gas constant R for air is about 53.35 ft·lbf/(lbmol·°R), but when using Btu units, 1 Btu is about 778 ft·lbf.

Wait, but perhaps it's easier to use R in units that match the given heat capacities.

Let me think. The entropy formula is:

S = n [ Cp ln(T/Tr) - R ln(Pi / Pr) ]

But the units must be consistent. Since Cp is given in Btu/lbmol·°R, and entropy is Btu/°R, R must be in Btu/(lbmol·°R) as well.

Wait, what's the value of R in Btu units? Let's see.

The universal gas constant R is 10.7316 psia·ft³/(lbmol·K). But since we're using °R, K and °R are the same in size.

But to convert R into Btu/(lbmol·°R), since 1 Btu is about 778.169 ft·lbf.

So 1 psia·ft³ is 1 lbf·ft² * ft³? Wait, psia is lbf per square inch. So:

1 psia = 1 lbf/in².

1 ft³ = 12³ in³ = 1728 in³.

So 1 psia·ft³ = 1 lbf/in² * 1728 in³ = 1728 lbf·in = 1728/12 lbf·ft = 144 lbf·ft.

So 1 psia·ft³ = 144 ft·lbf.

Then R is 10.7316 psia·ft³/(lbmol·°R) = 10.7316 * 144 ft·lbf/(lbmol·°R).

10.7316 *144 = let's calculate that.

10 *144 = 1440; 0.7316 *144 ≈ 105.5. So total is ~1545.5 ft·lbf/(lbmol·°R).

Convert that to Btu: 1 Btu = 778.169 ft·lbf.

So R = 1545.5 / 778.169 ≈ 1.984 Btu/(lbmol·°R).

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the calculation.

10.7316 psia·ft³/(lbmol·°R) * (144 ft·lbf/psia·ft³) ) = 10.7316 *144 ft·lbf/(lbmol·°R).

10.7316 * 144:

10 * 144 = 1440.

0.7316 * 144 = let's compute 0.7 *144=100.8; 0.0316*144≈4.556; total ≈105.36.

So total R ≈1440 +105.36 = 1545.36 ft·lbf/(lbmol·°R).

Convert to Btu: 1545.36 /778.169 ≈1.984 Btu/(lbmol·°R).

So R ≈1.984 Btu/(lbmol·°R).

So, for each gas, the entropy is:

S = n [ Cp ln(T/Tr) - R ln(Pi/Pr) ]

Where:

n = 1 lbmol for each.

Cp: for O2, Cp is 7.01 Btu/(lbmol·°R).

For N2, Cp is 6.96 Btu/(lbmol·°R).

T = 549.67 °R.

Tr = 459.67 °R.

Pi =6.75 psia.

Pr =14.7 psia.

So for O2:

S_O2 = 1 * [7.01 * ln(549.67/459.67) - 1.984 * ln(6.75/14.7) ]

Compute each term.

First term: ln(549.67/459.67) = ln(1.195) ≈0.179.

So 7.01 *0.179 ≈1.256 Btu/°R.

Second term: ln(6.75/14.7) = ln(0.4587)≈-0.787.

So 1.984 * (-0.787)= -1.568.

So S_O2 =1.256 - (-1.568)? Wait no, the formula is Cp ln(T/Tref) minus R ln(Pi/Pref). So:

S_O2 = 1 * [ (7.01 * 0.179) - (1.984 * (-0.787)) ]

Wait, wait, no:

Wait, the term is - R ln(Pi/Pr). So for O2:

= 7.01 * ln(T/Tr) - R * ln(Pi/Pr)

So 7.01 * 0.179 = 1.256.

R * ln(6.75/14.7) = 1.984 * ln(0.4587) ≈1.984 * (-0.787) ≈-1.563.

So the second term is negative: - (1.984 * (-0.787)) becomes +1.563.

Wait, no, the formula is [Cp ln(T) - R ln(P)]. So the overall term is 1.256 - (-1.563) = 1.256 + 1.563 = 2.819 Btu/°R.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Wait, let me recompute.

Let me compute the two terms step by step.

Term1: 7.01 * ln(549.67/459.67).

549.67 /459.67 = 1.195.

ln(1.195)=approx 0.179.

7.01 *0.179=1.256.

Term2: R * ln(6.75/14.7).

6.75/14.7 =0.4587.

ln(0.4587)=approx -0.787.

So term2:1.984 * (-0.787)= -1.563.

So the entropy S= term1 - term2?

Wait, no. The formula is:

S = n [ Cp ln(T/Tr) - R ln(Pi/Pr) ]

So for O2, it's [7.01 * 0.179 ] - [1.984 * (-0.787) ] = 1.256 - (-1.563) = 1.256 + 1.563 = 2.819.

So S_O2 is 2.819 Btu/°R.

Similarly, for N2:

Cp=6.96.

Term1:6.96 * ln(1.195)=6.96 *0.179≈1.246.

Term2:1.984 * ln(0.4587)=1.984*(-0.787)= -1.563.

So S_N2= [1.246 ] - [ -1.563 ] = 1.246 +1.563=2.809.

So total entropy S_total = S_O2 + S_N2 ≈2.819 +2.809=5.628 Btu/°R.

Wait, but looking at the options, the entropy values are around 7, 8, etc. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the partial pressure.

Wait, the problem states that the mixture is at 13.5 psia, and each gas has its own partial pressure. But wait, when calculating entropy for each gas, do we use the partial pressure or the total pressure? Oh wait, no, each gas's partial pressure is what matters, correct.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I should calculate entropy using the ideal gas law, considering each gas's own pressure and volume. Because in a mixture, each gas expands to fill the volume, so each has its own pressure.

Wait, but the formula I used should account for that via the partial pressure.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation steps.

Let me double-check the math.

Calculations for O2:

Term1: 7.01 * ln(549.67/459.67).

549.67 /459.67 = 1.195.

ln(1.195)=approx 0.179.

7.01 *0.179=1.256.

Term2: R * ln(6.75/14.7).

6.75/14.7=0.4587.

ln(0.4587)= -0.787.

1.984 * (-0.787)= -1.563.

So S_O2=1.256 - (-1.563)=1.256 +1.563=2.819.

Same for N2:

Term1:6.96 *0.179=1.246.

Term2: same as O2, so S_N2=1.246 +1.563=2.809.

Total S=5.628 Btu/°R.

But the options start at 5.04 (option I) up to 10.04 (option G). So 5.628 isn't matching any. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, perhaps the moles are different. Maybe the problem has 2 moles of O2 and 1 mole of N2, or something else. Let me re-read the question.

The question says: "1 mole of oxygen and moles of nitrogen." So perhaps it's 1 mole O2 and 'moles' undefined, but since it's a multiple choice, maybe the number is 1 mole each, but perhaps the initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, perhaps it's 1 mole O2 and 1 mole N2. So that's 2 moles total, which is what I thought.

Wait, could the mistake be that I used Cp instead of Cv? Because entropy calculations can sometimes use Cv when considering volume changes, but the formula I used is correct for when the process is at constant pressure. Wait, the entropy formula ΔS = n Cp ln(T2/T1) - n R ln(P2/P1) is correct for any process, not necessarily at constant pressure.

Wait, no, the formula is correct regardless. So that's probably not the issue.

Another thought: perhaps I should have used the total pressure instead of partial pressure. Let me think. No, because each gas in the mixture contributes its own partial pressure.

Wait, another approach: perhaps the entropy for each gas is calculated based on the total pressure, not partial. Because sometimes when the mixture is considered, each gas is at the total pressure. But that doesn't make sense because the presence of other gases affects the partial pressure.

Alternatively, perhaps the entropy should consider the change from the reference state to the mixture's T and P, but since each gas is in a mixture, their partial pressures are lower than the total. So I think my initial approach is correct.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps I made an error in the value of R. Let me double-check R in Btu units.

R is 10.731
