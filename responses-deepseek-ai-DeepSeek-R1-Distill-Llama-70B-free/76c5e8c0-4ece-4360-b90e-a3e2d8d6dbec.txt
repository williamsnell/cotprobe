Okay, so I have this problem here about calculating the activation energy of a reaction using the Arrhenius equation. Hmm, the question gives me two different temperatures and their corresponding times for the reaction to be 20% complete. I remember that the Arrhenius equation relates the rate constant k to temperature and activation energy. But wait, how does the time factor into this?

Oh right, when a reaction is 20% complete, that means 80% of the reactants are remaining. Assuming it's a first-order reaction, the rate constant k is related to the time by the equation ln([A]0/[A]) = kt. Since both cases are 20% complete, [A]0/[A] is the same for both, so the ratio of the rate constants would be the inverse of the ratio of the times. Because time is inversely proportional to k when the extent is the same.

So the two temperatures are 300 K and 340 K, with times 12.6 min and 3.20 min, respectively. Let me convert those times to the same units. Wait, since they're both in minutes, I can just use the ratio as is.

The Arrhenius equation is k = A * exp(-Ea/(R T)). Taking the ratio of the two rate constants would give me (k2/k1) = exp( (Ea/R) (1/T1 - 1/T2) )) / ?

Wait, no. Let's think again. If T2 is higher than T1, then k2 should be larger than k1 because the reaction is faster. So the ratio k2/k1 is equal to exp( [Ea/R] (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) ). Or is it (1/T2 - 1/T1)? Because when T increases, 1/T decreases. So Ea/R would be multiplied by (1/T1 - 1/T2), which is positive since T2 > T1.

Wait, let me write it down. From the Arrhenius equation, ln(k) = ln(A) - (Ea/(R T)). So for two different temperatures and rate constants:

ln(k2/k1) = (Ea/R) (1/T1 - 1/T2) ) / (because 1/T1 is larger than 1/T2 when T2 > T1).

Wait, no, let's subtract the two equations. ln(k2) - ln(k1) = (Ea/R)(1/T1 - 1/T2). So ln(k2/k1) equals (Ea/R)(1/T1 - 1/T2). Oh, but 1/T1 is bigger than 1/T2, so the right-hand side is positive, which makes sense because k2 > k1.

Now, since k is inversely proportional to time when the reaction is 20% complete, the rate constant is proportional to 1/t. So k2/k1 = t1/t2. Because if it takes less time, the rate is higher.

Wait, let me clarify. For the same extent of reaction, say 20% complete, the time taken would be t = (1/k) * ln([A]0/[A]). Since [A]0/[A] is the same in both cases, t is inversely proportional to k. So k2/k1 = t1/t2.

So substituting, ln(k2/k1) = ln(t1/t2) = (Ea/R)(1/T1 - 1/T2).

So Ea can be calculated as [ln(t1/t2) * R] / (1/T1 - 1/T2).

Wait, let me plug in the numbers.

t1 is 12.6 min, t2 is 3.20 min. So the ratio t1/t2 is 12.6 / 3.20. Let me calculate that: 12.6 divided by 3.2 is... 3.9375 approximately.

So ln(3.9375) is about... let me think. ln(4) is about 1.386, so 3.9375 is just a bit less than 4. Let's compute it. Let me calculate ln(3.9375). Hmm, maybe using a calculator would help, but since I can't, I'll approximate. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute it more accurately. Let's see: 3.9375 is 63/16. Maybe using the Taylor series or another approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can remember that ln(3.8) is about 1.335, and ln(3.9) is about 1.361. Wait, maybe I should just calculate it as accurately as possible.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps I can use the exact value. Let me compute 12.6 / 3.20 = 3.9375. So ln(3.9375) = 1.378. Let me double-check that. Let me think: e^1.378 is approximately e^1.3 is about 3.669, and e^1.378 is higher. Wait, e^1 is 2.718, e^1.6 is about 4.95. Hmm, perhaps I should just accept that I need to compute this value.

Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed with the variables and plug in the numbers step by step.

So Ea = [ln(t1/t2) * R] / (1/T1 - 1/T2).

Wait, but in the equation, it's ln(k2/k1) = (Ea/R)(1/T1 - 1/T2). But since k2/k1 = t1/t2, then ln(t1/t2) = (Ea/R)(1/T1 - 1/T2).

So Ea = [ ln(t1/t2) * R ] / (1/T1 - 1/T2 )

Wait, but wait: the denominator is (1/T1 - 1/T2). Let me compute that.

T1 is 300 K, T2 is 340 K.

1/300 = 0.003333..., 1/340≈0.00294118.

So 1/300 - 1/340 = (340 - 300) / (300 * 340) )= 40 / (102000) ) = 40/(102000) = 1/2550 ≈ 0.00039216.

So 1/T1 -1/T2 = (T2 - T1)/(T1 T2). Because 1/a -1/b= (b -a)/(ab).

So in this case, 1/300 - 1/340 = (340-300)/(300 *340) )=40/(102000)=1/2550≈0.00039216.

Now, the numerator is ln(3.9375) multiplied by R.

R is the gas constant, which is 8.314 J/mol·K.

So ln(3.9375) is approximately 1.378.

So the numerator is 1.378 * 8.314 ≈ 11.46 J/mol.

Denominator is 0.00039216 K⁻¹.

So Ea = 11.46 / 0.00039216 = let's compute that.

11.46 / 0.00039216 ≈ approximately 29200 J/mol, which is 29.2 kJ/mol.

Wait, but let me compute it more accurately.

Wait, 0.00039216 is approximately 3.9216e-4.

So 11.46 / 3.9216e-4 = ?

Let me compute 11.46 / 0.00039216.

Let me write it as 11.46 / 0.00039216 = (11.46 * 1e4) ) / (0.39216) )= 114600 / 0.39216.

Let me compute 114600 divided by 0.39216.

Hmm, 0.39216 * 292 = 0.39216 * 290 = let's see: 0.39216 * 300 is 117.648, so 0.39216 *290 is 117.648 - (0.39216 *10)= 117.648 - 3.9216= 113.7264.

Wait, but 0.39216 *292: 292 is 290 +2. So 113.7264 + (0.39216 *2) = 113.7264 + 0.78432 = 114.51072.

So 0.39216 *292= 114.51072.

But our numerator is 114600, so 114600 /0.39216 = approximately 292 * 1e4 / ?

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 114600 / 0.39216.

Let me compute 0.39216 * 292 = approximately 114.51, as I did before.

So 114600 is 1146 * 100. So 0.39216 * 292 = 114.51072, so 292 * (1000) would be 292,000.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a miscalculation here. Alternatively, perhaps I should compute 114600 / 0.39216.

Let me compute 114600 ÷ 0.39216.

Let me express this as (114600 * 10000 ) / 39216.

Wait, 114600 * 10000 = 1,146,000,000.

Divide that by 39216: 1,146,000,000 / 39,216.

Let me compute 39,216 * 29,000 = ?

39,216 * 20,000 = 783,120,000.

39,216 *9,000 = 352,944,000.

So 783,120,000 +352,944,000 = 1,136,064,000.

Which is close to 1,146,000,000.

The difference is 1,146,000,000 -1,136,064,000 = 9,936,000.

So 39,216 * x = 9,936,000.

x = 9,936,000 / 39,216 ≈ let's see, 39,216 * 253 = ?

39,216 * 250 = 9,804,000. 39,216 *3=117,648. So 9,804,000 +117,648=9,921,648. That's close to 9,936,000. The difference is 9,936,000 -9,921,648 = 14,352.

So 14,352 /39,216 ≈ 0.366.

So x ≈ 253.366.

So total is 29,000 +253.366 ≈29,253.366.

So 29,253. So Ea is approximately 29,253 J/mol, which is about 29.25 kJ/mol.

Looking at the options, option I is 29.06 kJ, option J is 31.88 kJ, option E is 27.00, etc.

Wait, but I approximated ln(3.9375) as 1.378. Let me check the exact value of ln(3.9375).

Using a calculator, ln(3.9375) is approximately 1.3782.

So the calculation seems correct.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me recheck the formula.

Ea = [ ln(t1/t2) * R ] / (1/T1 - 1/T2 )

Wait, but wait: 1/T1 is 1/300, 1/T2 is 1/340. So 1/T1 -1/T2 is positive, as I had before.

So Ea is positive, which makes sense.

Wait, but let me recheck the calculation for the denominator.

1/300 = 0.0033333..., 1/340 ≈0.002941176.

So 0.0033333 - 0.002941176 = 0.00039216, which is correct.

So the denominator is 0.00039216.

The numerator was ln(12.6/3.20)= ln(3.9375)=1.3782, multiplied by R=8.314.

So 1.3782 *8.314 = let's compute that accurately.

1.3 *8=10.4, 0.0782*8=0.6256, so 10.4 + 0.6256=11.0256. Wait, that's just for 1.378*8. But R is 8.314.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 1.3782 *8.314.

Let me compute 1 *8.314 =8.314.

0.3 *8.314=2.4942.

0.07 *8.314=0.582.

0.0082 *8.314≈0.0681788.

Adding them up: 8.314 +2.4942=10.8082; +0.582=11.3902; +0.0681788≈11.4584.

So approximately 11.4584 J/mol.

Then Ea is 11.4584 / 0.00039216 = 29200 J/mol, which is 29.2 kJ/mol.

Looking at the options, the closest is option I:29.06 kJ.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere. Because 29.2 is close to 29.06, but maybe I missed a decimal point.

Wait, perhaps I should re-calculate the ratio t1/t2.

t1 is 12.6 min, t2 is3.20 min.

12.6 /3.2 = (126/32) )= (63/16) )=3.9375. Correct.

So ln(3.9375)=1.3782.

So 1.3782 *8.314=11.458 J/mol.

Denominator is 0.00039216.

So 11.458 /0.00039216 = ?

Let me compute 11.458 ÷ 0.00039216.

Which is same as 11458 ÷ 3.9216 ≈.

Let me compute 3.9216 × 2920 = ?

3.9216 *2920.

3 *2920=8760.

0.9216 *2920: 0.9*2920=2628, 0.0216*2920≈63.072. So total 2628+63.072=2691.072.

So 3.9216 *2920=8760 +2691.072=11451.072.

Which is close to 11458. So 2920 + (6.928/3.9216) ) ≈2920 +1.767=2921.767.

So 2921.767 ≈2922.

So Ea is approximately 2922 * (8.314 / 1000) ? Wait no, because the previous calculation gives Ea in J/mol.

Wait, no, wait: 11.458 J/(mol·K) * (1 / 0.00039216 K⁻¹) )= 11.458 / 0.00039216 J/mol.

Wait, 11.458 /0.00039216 = 29200 J/mol =29.2 kJ/mol.

Hmm, but the closest option is I:29.06, but my calculation gives about 29.2. Let me check if I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, another approach: perhaps using the Arrhenius equation in terms of the rate constants.

Wait, but I derived the formula correctly: ln(k2/k1)= (Ea/R)(1/T1 -1/T2).

And since k is inversely proportional to time when the conversion is the same, k2/k1 = t1/t2.

So the formula I used should be correct.

Wait, but perhaps I should use the reciprocal. Because t1 = (ln(5)/k1), t2=(ln(5)/k2), assuming 20% conversion is ln(5) because [A]0/[A]=5/4?

Wait, wait a second. Let me think again. For a first-order reaction, the time to reach a certain conversion is t = (1/k) ln([A]0/[A]). For 20% reaction, [A] is 80% of [A]0, so [A]0/[A] = 1/(1 - 0.2) = 1/0.8 = 1.25. So ln(1.25) ≈ 0.2231.

So t = (ln(1.25))/k.

So k = ln(1.25)/t.

Thus, k2/k1 = t1/(t2 * (ln(1.25)/ln(1.25)) )) )= t1/t2.

So the earlier approach is correct.

So then, why the answer is not matching exactly? Because the options may round differently. Let's compute more accurately.

Let me compute ln(12.6/3.20) precisely.

12.6 ÷3.20 =3.9375.

ln(3.9375)=1.3782133 approximately.

R=8.314 J/mol·K.

So 1.3782133 *8.314 = let's compute this accurately.

1.3782133 *8 =11.025709.

1.3782133 *0.314= let's compute 1.3782133 *0.3=0.413464, plus 1.3782133 *.014=0.019295.

So 0.413464 +0.019295=0.432759.

So total 11.025709 +0.432759=11.458468 J/mol.

Denominator: (1/300 -1/340) = (340-300)/(300*340) )=40/(102000)=1/2550=0.0003921568627.

So Ea=11.458468 /0.0003921568627 = ?

Compute 11.458468 ÷0.0003921568627.

Which is the same as 11458.468 ÷3.921568627 = approx.

Let me compute 3.921568627 ×2920 = ?

3.921568627 *2920.

Calculate 3.921568627 *2920:

3 *2920=8760.

0.921568627 *2920.

Compute 0.9 *2920=2628.

0.021568627 *2920 ≈62.999.

So 2628 +62.999≈2690.999.

So 3.921568627 *2920=8760 +2690.999≈11450.999.

So 3.921568627 *2920≈11451.

We have 11458.468, so the difference is 7.468.

So 7
