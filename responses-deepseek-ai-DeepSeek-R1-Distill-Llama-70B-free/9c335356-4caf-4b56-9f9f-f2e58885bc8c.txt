Question:

Which of the following statements is NOT correct about apoptosis?

Options:

A: Apoptosis, a special type of cell division, requires multiple cell signaling.
B: The fact that apoptosis is widespread across several kingdoms is evidence that it evolved early in the evolution of eukaryotes.
C: Apoptosis plays a crucial role in the development of fingers in embryonic development.
D: Apoptosis prevents an aging and dying cell from damaging neighboring cells.

Okay, so I've got this question about apoptosis, and I'm a bit new to the topic, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which statement is NOT correct about apoptosis. The options are A through D. Let me go through each one.

First, I remember that apoptosis is programmed cell death, not cell division. Oh wait, option A says it's a special type of cell division. That doesn't sound right. Cell division is mitosis or meiosis, right? So A might be incorrect.

Option B: Apoptosis being widespread across kingdoms as evidence it evolved early. I think apoptosis is a eukaryotic process. Since it's found in many eukaryotes, it probably evolved early on. That makes sense, so B is correct.

Option C: Crucial role in developing fingers. I've heard that during embryonic development, apoptosis sculpts tissues. For example, in the formation of fingers, the tissue between them dies, so the fingers separate. So C is correct.

Option D: Prevents aging or dying cells from damaging others. Yes, apoptosis helps remove cells that are old or damaged. If they weren't removed, they could cause problems like cancer or inflammation. So D is correct.

So the incorrect statement is A because apoptosis isn't a type of cell division. It's the oppositeâ€”cell death.

The incorrect statement is:

A: Apoptosis, a special type of cell division, requires multiple cell signaling.

Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death, not a type of cell division. It involves a series of cellular signals leading to the organized death of cells, which is distinct from processes like mitosis or meiosis. Therefore, option A is NOT correct.

Answer: A
