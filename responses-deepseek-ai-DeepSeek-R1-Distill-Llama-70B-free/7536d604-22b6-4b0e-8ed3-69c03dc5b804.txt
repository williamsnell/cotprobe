Okay, so I have this physics problem to solve about an electron in a rectangular well. Hmm, I remember that a rectangular well is a potential well where the potential is zero inside a certain region and some higher value outside. The depth here is 20.0 eV, which I think means the potential outside the well is 20 eV higher than the inside.

The question says the lowest energy level lies 3.00 eV above the bottom of the well. So the ground state energy is 3 eV. I need to find the width of the well.

I recall that for a particle in a one-dimensional box (which is what a rectangular well is), the energy levels are given by the equation E_n = (n² h²) / (8 m L²), where h is Planck's constant, m is the mass of the electron, and L is the width of the well. But wait, I think I should check the exact formula.

Wait, no, wait. That formula is for a particle in a box where the potential inside is zero and outside is infinite. But in this case, the well is finite because the depth is 20 eV. So the particle isn't confined infinitely, which means the wavefunction can tunnel into the barriers, right? Oh wait, but for the finite well, the solutions are different. So maybe I should think about that.

When the well is finite, the allowed energy levels are found by solving a transcendental equation. For the ground state (n=1), the equation involves the tangent function. Oh right, the equation is something like tan(θ) = something... Let me think. The equation for the even and odd solutions—I think for the ground state, which is the lowest energy, it's the first solution.

Wait, let's get this straight. For a finite square well, the solutions are found by considering the wavefunction inside and outside the well. Inside the well, the solution is a combination of sine and cosine, and outside, it's an exponential decay. The boundary conditions require the wavefunction and its derivative to be continuous at the edges.

So the condition for the allowed energies comes out to something like tan(θ) = sqrt((V0 - E)/E), where θ is some variable involving the width and the wavevector. Or wait, maybe it's the other way around. Let me try to write down the equation correctly.

The standard approach is to have two regions: inside the well (where the potential is zero) and outside (where the potential is V0). Inside, the solution is oscillatory, so the wavefunction is sinusoidal. Outside, it's exponential.

The energy E is measured from the bottom of the well, so the depth of the well is V0 = 20 eV. The ground state energy is E = 3 eV, which is much less than V0, so the electron is bound.

The equation that comes from matching the boundary conditions at x = L/2 (assuming the well is symmetric from -L/2 to L/2) is:

tan(θ) = sqrt( (V0 - E)/(E) )

Wait no, wait, I think it's:

tan(θ) = sqrt( (V0 - E ) / E )

Wait, maybe no. Let me think again. Let me define the variables properly.

Inside the well (region I), the wavevector k1 is sqrt(2mE)/(ħ²). Wait no, the general form is k = sqrt(2m(E - V))/ħ². So inside the well, where V=0, k1 = sqrt(2mE)/ħ.

Outside the well (region II), the wavevector k2 would be sqrt(2m(V0 - E))/ħ. Because E < V0, so V0 - E is positive.

The boundary conditions at x = L/2 give the equation:

tan(k1 L/2) = (k2)/(k1)

Wait, or is it (k1)/(k2)? Let me think. Oh right, the condition comes from the continuity of the derivative, but depending on whether it's even or odd solution, but for the ground state, it's symmetric, so perhaps it's the even solution. But maybe I should just focus on the general approach.

Wait, but the equation for the allowed energies when E < V0 is:

tan(θ) = sqrt( (V0 - E) / E ) * (something), but I'm getting a bit mixed up. Alternatively, the equation is:

tan(θ) = sqrt( (V0 - E) / E ) * (m L^2) something... Hmm, maybe it's better to look at the standard equation.

Wait, I think the correct equation is:

tan(θ) = sqrt( (V0 - E) / E )

where θ = (L/2) * sqrt(2mE/ħ²). Wait, no, wait—θ is the product of k1 times L/2.

Because k1 is sqrt(2mE/ħ²), so θ = (L/2) * sqrt(2mE/ħ²).

So putting it together, the equation is:

tan(θ) = sqrt( (V0 - E) / E ) * (m * (ħ^2) )^(something... Wait, perhaps I'm complicating things. Let me think about the equation again.

Wait, the correct equation for the finite square well at the ground state (even solution) is:

tan(θ) = sqrt( (V0 - E) / E )

where θ = (L/2) * sqrt(2mE/ħ²).

So given that E is 3 eV, V0 is 20 eV, we can plug in and solve for L.

Wait, but how do I compute θ from that? Because θ is part of the equation. Hmm.

So let me write the equation as tan(theta) = sqrt( (20 - 3)/3 ) = sqrt(17/3) ≈ sqrt(5.6667) ≈ 2.3805.

So tan(theta) ≈ 2.3805.

But theta is (L/(2ħ)) * sqrt(2 m E).

Wait, let me compute this step by step.

Let me first compute the numerical values.

Given:
E = 3.00 eV
V0 = 20.0 eV
We need to compute L.

We have:

theta = (L/2) * sqrt(2mE) / ħ.

Wait, the units are a bit tricky here. Let me make sure I use the correct constants.

First, let's convert energies to joules because the constants are in SI units.

E = 3.00 eV = 3.00 * 1.60218e-19 J ≈ 4.8065e-19 J.

V0 = 20.0 eV = 20 * 1.60218e-19 ≈ 3.204e-18 J.

The mass of the electron m = 9.10938e-31 kg.

Planck's constant ħ = h/(2π) ≈ 1.05457e-34 J·s.

But let me compute theta first.

The equation is tan(theta) = sqrt( (V0 - E)/E ) = sqrt(17/3) ≈ 2.3805.

So theta = arctan(2.3805). Let me compute that.

Arctan(2.3805) is approximately... Let me think, tan(67 degrees) is about 2.355, and tan(68) is around 2.475. So 2.3805 is between 67 and 68 degrees. Let's compute it more accurately.

Using a calculator, perhaps, but since I can't, I'll approximate. Let's say it's about 67.3 degrees or 1.174 radians. Wait, wait, wait—no, 67 degrees is about 1.169 radians. Let me think.

Wait, 60 degrees is π/3 ≈ 1.047 rad. 67 degrees is 67 * π/180 ≈ 1.169 rad. 67.3 degrees would be a bit more. Let me compute it more precisely.

Wait, but perhaps I should use the small angle approximation or a better approach. Alternatively, I can use a calculator-like approach mentally.

But perhaps it's easier to compute theta in radians.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find theta as arctan(2.3805) ≈ 1.209 radians. Wait, because tan(1.209) ≈ ?

Wait, I recall that tan(1.2) is about 2.572, which is higher than 2.3805. So 1.2 radians is about 68.7 degrees, which is higher than the angle we need. Let me try 1.18 radians.

tan(1.18) ≈ let's see: 1.18 rad is approximately 67.7 degrees.

Compute tan(1.18):

We can use the approximation method.

We know that tan(1.169) = tan(67 degrees) ≈ 2.3559.

tan(1.18) = ?

The derivative of tan(x) is sec²(x). So between x=1.169 (67 degrees) and x=1.18, the change is 0.011 radians.

At x=1.169, tan(x)=2.3559. The derivative at that point is 1 + tan²(x) = 1 + (2.3559)^2 ≈ 1 + 5.550 ≈ 6.550. So for a small delta_x=0.011, the approximate tan(x+delta_x) ≈ 2.3559 + (6.550)(0.011) ≈ 2.3559 + 0.072 ≈ 2.4279.

But we have tan(theta)=2.3805, which is between 2.3559 and 2.4279. The delta from 2.3559 to 2.3805 is 0.0246. The slope is 6.55 per 0.011 delta_x. So delta_x ≈ 0.011 * (0.0246) / (6.55 * 0.011) ) -> Hmm, perhaps it's easier to compute the fraction.

The desired tan is 2.3805. Between x=1.169 (tan=2.3559) and x=1.18 (tan≈2.4279). The difference between 2.4279 and 2.3559 is about 0.072 over 0.011 radians. So for 2.3805, the delta from 2.3559 is 0.0246.

So fraction = 0.0246 / 0.072 = 0.3417. So delta_x ≈ 0.011 * 0.3417 ≈ 0.00376. So x ≈ 1.169 + 0.00376 ≈ 1.17276 radians. Approximately 1.173 radians.

So theta ≈ 1.173 radians.

Now, theta is given by (L/(2)) * sqrt(2mE)/ħ.

So, theta = (L/(2)) * sqrt(2 m E) / ħ.

We can solve for L:

L = 2 theta ħ / sqrt(2 m E).

Plugging in the numbers:

theta ≈ 1.173 rad.

Now compute each term:

Compute sqrt(2 m E):

m = 9.10938e-31 kg.

E = 3 eV = 4.8065e-19 J.

So 2 m E = 2 * 9.10938e-31 kg * 4.8065e-19 J.

Wait, J is kg m²/s², so 2 m E has units kg² m²/s² ?

Wait, 2 m E = 2 * 9.10938e-31 kg * 4.8065e-19 J.

But let me compute it numerically:

2 * 9.10938e-31 = 1.821876e-30.

Multiply by 4.8065e-19 → 1.821876e-30 * 4.8065e-19 = ?

1.821876e-30 * 4.8065e-19 = approx 8.75e-49 kg·J.

Wait, but J is kg m²/s², so kg·J is kg² m²/s².

But when taking the square root, sqrt(2 m E) will have units sqrt(kg² m²/s²) ) → kg m/s, which is the unit of momentum. So the units make sense.

But let me compute the numerical value:

2 m E = 2 * 9.10938e-31 kg * 4.8065e-19 J = 1.821876e-30 kg * 4.8065e-19 J = 8.754e-49 kg·J.

Wait, but 1.821876e-30 * 4.8065e-19 = Let's compute 1.821876e-30 * 4.8065e-19.

Multiply 1.821876 * 4.8065 ≈ around 8.75 (since 1.8 *4.8=8.64), so approximately 8.75e-30-19= 8.75e-49.

So sqrt(2 m E) = sqrt(8.75e-49) = sqrt(8.75) * 1e-24.5.

sqrt(8.75)= approximately 2.958.

Wait, 2.958^2 = 8.75.

So sqrt(8.75e-49) = 2.958e-24.5 kg m/s.

Wait, 1e-24.5 is the same as 1e-24 * sqrt(1e-1) )= 1e-24.5 ≈ 3.16e-25.

So 2.958e-24.5 → approx 2.958 * 3.16e-25 → 9.35e-25 kg m/s.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute it using exponents properly.

Wait, 8.75e-49 is 8.75 x 10^-49.

The square root is sqrt(8.75) x 10^(-49/2) = 2.958 x 10^-24.5.

But 10^-24.5 is 10^(-24) * 10^(-0.5) )= 10^-24 * 0.3162. So 2.958 * 0.3162 ≈ 0.936. So sqrt(2 m E) ≈ 0.936e-24 kg m/s.

Wait, that's 9.36e-25 kg m/s.

Wait, perhaps I should do exact calculation:

sqrt(8.75e-49) = sqrt(8.75) * 1e-24.5.

sqrt(8.75)= approx 2.958.

1e-24.5 = 1e-24 * 1e-0.5 = 1e-24 * 0.3162 ≈ 3.162e-25.

So 2.958 * 3.162e-25 ≈ 9.35e-25 kg m/s.

So sqrt(2 m E)= 9.35e-25 kg m/s.

Now, Planck's constant ħ is 1.05457e-34 J·s.

So now, putting into the equation for L:

L = 2 * theta * ħ / sqrt(2 m E).

Plugging in the numbers:

theta ≈ 1.173 rad.

So 2 * theta ≈ 2.346 rad.

So numerator: 2.346 * ħ = 2.346 * 1.05457e-34 ≈ 2.346 * 1.05457e-34.

Compute 2.346 * 1.05457 ≈ 2.346 * 1.05 ≈ 2.463. So approximately 2.463e-34 J·s.

Denominator: sqrt(2 m E)= 9.35e-25 kg m/s.

So L ≈ (2.463e-34) / (9.35e-25) meters.

Compute this division:

2.463e-34 / 9.35e-25 = (2.463 / 9.35) ) * 1e-9.

2.463 /9.35 ≈ 0.2635.

So 0.2635e-9 meters = 0.2635 nm.

Looking at the options, option H is 0.264 nm. So that's very close.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made some approximations that could affect the result.

Let me recalculate some steps more accurately.

First, the exact value of sqrt(2 m E):

m = 9.10938356e-31 kg.

E = 3 eV = 3 * 1.602176634e-19 J = 4.806530e-19 J.

So 2 m E = 2 *9.10938356e-31 *4.806530e-19.

Calculate 2 *9.10938356e-31 = 1.8218767e-30.

Multiply by 4.806530e-19: 1.8218767e-30 *4.806530e-19 = let's compute 1.8218767 *4.806530 = approx 8.75, but exact?

1.8218767 *4.806530:

Compute 1.8 *4.8 = 8.64.

1.8 *0.0653 = 0.1175.

0.0218767 *4.8 = approx 0.1049.

0.0218767 *0.0653≈ approx 0.001427.

Adding up: 8.64 +0.1175 +0.1049 +0.001427 ≈ 8.64 + 0.2238 ≈ 8.8638.

So 1.8218767e-30 *4.806530e-19 = 8.8638e-49.

So sqrt(8.8638e-49) = sqrt(8.8638) * 1e-24.5.

sqrt(8.8638)= approx 2.976.

Because 2.976^2 = 8.856, which is close to 8.8638.

So sqrt(8.8638e-49) = 2.976e-24.5.

As before, 1e-24.5 = 3.1623e-25.

So 2.976 *3.1623e-25 → 2.976 *3.1623 ≈9.406, so 9.406e-25 kg m/s.

So sqrt(2 m E)= 9.406e-25
