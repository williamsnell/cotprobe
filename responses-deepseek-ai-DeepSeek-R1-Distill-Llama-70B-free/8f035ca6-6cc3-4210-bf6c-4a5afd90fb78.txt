Okay, so I have this question about personnel selection and the term "adverse impact." Hmm, I remember that adverse impact has something to do with discrimination in hiring practices, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact definition. Let me think this through.

From what I recall, adverse impact is when a hiring process unintentionally discriminates against a protected group. It's not necessarily intentional, but the effect is that certain groups are negatively impacted. So it's about the outcomes, not the intent.

I think the concept relates to the four-fifths rule or something like 80%. Oh right, if a protected group is hired at a rate less than 80% of the most successful group, that's when adverse impact is considered. So the group with the highest selection rate is the benchmark, and others are compared to that.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the total process results in equal results for all groups. That doesn't sound right because adverse impact implies unequal results.

Option B: A group covered by law is hired at more than 80% of the best group. Wait, that's actually the opposite. If they're above 80%, that's okay, right? Because it's less than 80% that's problematic.

Option C mentions adverse conditions, but I think it's more about the statistical outcome, not the conditions themselves.

Option D talks about a non-covered group being hired higher. But adverse impact is about protected groups, so this doesn't fit.

Option E: A covered group is hired at less than 80% of the best group. That sounds exactly like the four-fifths rule I was thinking of. So this could be the correct answer.

Option F is about a non-covered group being below 80%. But again, adverse impact focuses on protected groups, so this probably isn't it.

Option G says the process results in unequal results for groups covered by law. That's a bit vague. Adverse impact is a specific kind of unequal result, so maybe G is correct, but I think E is more precise.

Option H and J talk about interviews being adverse or favorable. I don't think the term adverse impact specifically refers to the interview process itself, just the overall outcome.

So, putting it together: Adverse impact occurs when a protected group's hiring rate is less than 80% of the highest group. So the correct answer should be option E.

The term "adverse impact" in personnel selection refers to a situation where a hiring process unintentionally discriminates against a protected group, resulting in unequal outcomes. Specifically, it occurs when the hiring rate of a protected group is less than 80% of the hiring rate of the group with the highest selection rate. This is often referred to as the four-fifths rule. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** suggests equal results for all groups, which contradicts the concept of adverse impact.  
- **Option B** describes a hiring rate above 80%, which does not indicate adverse impact.  
- **Option C** refers to adverse conditions, but adverse impact is about statistical outcomes, not conditions.  
- **Option D** involves a non-protected group, which is irrelevant to adverse impact.  
- **Option E** correctly describes adverse impact as a hiring rate for a protected group below 80% of the best-performing group.  
- **Option F** pertains to a non-protected group, which is not the focus of adverse impact.  
- **Option G** mentions unequal results but is less precise than Option E.  
- **Options H and J** focus on interviews, which is not the definition of adverse impact.  

Thus, the correct answer is **Option E**.
