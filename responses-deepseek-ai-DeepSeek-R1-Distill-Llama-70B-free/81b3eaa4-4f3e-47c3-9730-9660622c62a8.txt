Okay, so I've got this question here about how many children between the ages of 5-14 worked globally as of 2012. The options are A through J, with numbers ranging from 5 million up to 1 billion. Hmm, I need to figure this out.

I remember learning that child labor is a significant issue in many parts of the world. But I'm not exactly sure about the exact numbers. Let me think about what I know. I think the International Labour Organization (ILO) reports on these statistics. They probably had a study around 2012.

Wait, I recall that in the past, the number was around 150-200 million children involved in child labor. But wait, the question specifies the age range as 5-14. So maybe it's a bit different. I think the ILO defines child labor as work that deprives children of their childhood, their potential, and their dignity, and that's harmful to their physical and mental development.

I think the number was somewhere around 150 million. Let me see. Another thought: sometimes the numbers are split into different categories, like hazardous work versus any economic activity. Oh right, the ILO might have different categories. For example, in 2012, the number of children in child labor aged 5-14 was about 150 million, but when you include all ages up to 17, it's higher.

Wait, no, I think the 150 million figure includes children aged 5-14. Or was it 168 million? I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact number. Alternatively, I remember that the global estimate for child labor in 2012 was 168 million. But that might include all children under 18, not just 5-14.

Wait, the question is specifically about ages 5-14. So if the total under 18 was 168 million, maybe a portion of that is 5-14. But I think that the majority of child laborers are in that 5-14 age group. Alternatively, perhaps the number is 100 million. No, that seems low.

Wait, I think I might have read that as of 2012, there were approximately 150 million children aged 5-14 engaged in child labor. So looking at the options, option D is 150 million, which would be the correct answer. Alternatively, some sources might say 168 million, but that's probably the total including older teens.

So the answer should be D: 150 million.

The correct answer is D: 150 million.
