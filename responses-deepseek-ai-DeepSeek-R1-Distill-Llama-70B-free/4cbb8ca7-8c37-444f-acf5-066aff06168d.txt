Okay, so I have this problem here about Chesa making soup. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

Last year, Chesa made 32 one-cup servings of soup. This year, she's making two times that amount. The question is asking how many gallons she'll make this year. The options are from A to J with different numbers.

Hmm, wait. The problem is about converting servings to gallons, I think. Because 32 one-cup servings is a volume, but we need to find gallons. 

So first, I should figure out how much soup she made last year in cups. She made 32 servings, each one cup. So 32 cups total. That makes sense.

But wait, the question is about this year. She's making two times last year's amount. So this year, she's making 2 * 32 cups. Let me calculate that. 2 times 32 is 64 cups. So 64 cups of soup this year.

Now, the tricky part is converting cups to gallons. I remember that in the US measurement system, there are 16 cups in a gallon. So I need to figure out how many gallons 64 cups is.

To convert cups to gallons, I think I divide the number of cups by 16. So 64 divided by 16. Let's see, 16 times 4 is 64. So 64 cups is equal to 4 gallons.

Wait, let me double-check that. 1 gallon is 16 cups. So 4 gallons would be 4 * 16, which is 64 cups. Yep, that matches. So this year, she's making 4 gallons.

Looking back at the options, option D is 4. So the answer should be D.

To determine how many gallons of soup Chesa will make this year, we start by calculating the total volume of soup she made last year and then scale it up.

1. **Last Year's Soup Volume**: Chesa made 32 one-cup servings, so the total volume last year was \( 32 \, \text{cups} \).

2. **This Year's Soup Volume**: She is making two times last year's amount, so this year's volume is:
   \[
   2 \times 32 \, \text{cups} = 64 \, \text{cups}.
   \]

3. **Conversion to Gallons**: Since there are \( 16 \, \text{cups} \) in a gallon, we convert cups to gallons by dividing:
   \[
   \frac{64 \, \text{cups}}{16 \, \text{cups per gallon}} = 4 \, \text{gallons}.
   \]

Thus, Chesa will make \( 4 \, \text{gallons} \) of soup this year. The correct answer is **D**.
