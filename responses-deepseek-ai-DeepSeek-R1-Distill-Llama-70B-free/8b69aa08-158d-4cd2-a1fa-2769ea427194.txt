Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this insurance question. Let me read it again. The question is asking about how much a collision insurance policy would pay in two different scenarios. 

The first part is about a $100 deductible policy and an accident repair bill of $89.90. The second part is a $50 deductible policy with a repair bill of $76.40. I need to find out how much the insurance would pay in each case and then choose the correct option from the given choices.

Alright, I remember that a deductible is the amount the policyholder has to pay out of pocket before the insurance kicks in. So the insurance pays the amount after subtracting the deductible, but only if the repair cost is higher than the deductible. If the repair cost is less than the deductible, the insurance doesn't pay anything because the deductible hasn't been met yet.

Let's tackle the first scenario: a $100 deductible and an $89.90 repair bill. Since $89.90 is less than $100, the deductible isn't met. So the insurance wouldn't pay anything here. That means the insurance pays $0 in the first case.

Now the second scenario: a $50 deductible and a $76.40 repair bill. Here, the repair cost is higher than the deductible. So the insurance would cover the difference. That would be $76.40 minus $50, which equals $26.40. So the insurance pays $26.40 in the second case.

Putting it together, the first payment is $0 and the second is $26.40. Now I need to look at the options to see which one matches this.

Looking at the options:

A: $0 and $26.40 → This matches what I calculated.
B: $10.10 and $0 → Doesn't fit.
C: $0 and $76.40 → Second part is wrong.
D: Both over → No.
E: Both lower.
F: Both deductibles paid, no.
G: First is $10.10, no.
H: Second is $50, but I thought it's $26.40.
I: Second is $50, no.
J: Second is $0, no.

So the correct answer should be option A. Wait, but let me double-check. 

Wait, another thought: Insurance policies usually don't pay when the repair is less than the deductible. So yes, first case $0.

Second case: 76.40 minus 50 is 26.40. So yes, $26.40.

Looking back, option A is the only one that has $0 and $26.40. So I think the answer is A.

The question involves determining how much a collision insurance policy would pay in two scenarios. 

1. **First Scenario**: A $100 deductible policy with an $89.90 repair bill. Since the repair cost ($89.90) is less than the deductible ($100), the insurance does not pay anything. Thus, the payment is $0.

2. **Second Scenario**: A $50 deductible policy with a $76.40 repair bill. Here, the repair cost ($76.40) exceeds the deductible ($50). The insurance pays the difference, which is $76.40 - $50 = $26.40.

The correct option is **A: $0 and $26.40**, as it matches the calculated payments.
