Alright, so I've got this problem here about Finkel Company and a draft they accepted. Hmm, okay, I remember from my accounting classes that a draft is like a type of bill of exchange. So Finkel accepted a 90-day after sight draft for $850 on May 10. Then it was discounted on July 1 at 5%. There's also a bank fee of 1/4 percent. I need to find the proceeds.

Wait, let me break it down. So the draft is after sight, which means the bank will start counting the days from when they accept it, right? So the maturity date would be 90 days after May 10. Let me calculate that. May has 31 days, so from May 10 to May 31 is 21 days. Then adding 90 days: June is 30, so 21+30 = 51, then 90-51=39 days left in July. So the due date would be July 9th? Wait, May 10 plus 90 days. Let me count: May 10 to May 31 is 21 days. Then June has 30, that's 51, then July has 31. 51 plus 39 is 90. So the 39th day in July is July 9th? Or is it the 8th? Wait, no, because May 10 is day 0, then day 1 is May 11, so adding 90 days would make it July 9th. So the draft matures on July 9th.

But the draft was discounted on July 1. Oh, okay, so before the maturity date. So the bank is discounting it, which means they're paying Finkel the present value, and the difference is the interest plus fees.

The discount rate is 5%, and the bank charges a collection fee of 1/4 percent. So I think the proceeds Finkel gets would be the face value minus the discount and the fee.

Wait, how does the discounting work? The formula for the discount is usually face value multiplied by the rate multiplied by the time. Time being the number of days from the discount date to maturity, divided by 360 or 365. I think in this context, it's probably 360 days for simple interest calculations.

So first, I need to calculate the number of days between July 1 and July 9. That's 8 days. Because July 1 to July 9 is 8 days later (since July 1 is day 0, then 2nd is 1, up to 9th being 8 days). Wait, no: from July 1 to July 9 is 8 days. Because 1 to 2 is +1, so 1-9 is 8 days.

So time is 8/360 years.

The discount would be $850 * 5% * (8/360). Let me calculate that: 850 * 0.05 = 42.5; 42.5 * (8/360) = 42.5 * 0.022222... ≈ 0.944444... So about $0.94 discount.

Then the collection fee is 1/4 percent of the face value. 1/4 percent is 0.25%, so 850 * 0.0025 = 2.125.

Wait, but wait. The collection fee is a flat fee, right? So the total deductions would be the discount plus the fee. So total deductions are 0.94 + 2.125 = approximately $3.065.

So the proceeds would be 850 - 3.065 = $846.935, which is about $846.94. Looking at the options, D is $846.51. Hmm, but maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me check the numbers again.

Alternatively, perhaps the discount is computed differently. Let me recalculate the discount accurately.

The discount is (face value) * (rate) * (time). Time is 8 days. So 8/360 = 0.022222...

So 850 * 0.05 * (8/360) = 850 * 0.05 = 42.5. Then 42.5 * (8/360) = 42.5 * 0.0222222 = let me compute 42.5 * 0.02 = 0.85, and 42.5 * 0.002222 ≈ 0.094444. So total 0.85 + 0.094444 = 0.944444, so $0.9444.

The collection fee is 0.25% of 850. So 850 * 0.0025 = 2.125.

So total deductions: 0.9444 + 2.125 = 3.0694. So proceeds are 850 - 3.0694 = 846.9306. So approximately $846.93.

Looking at the options, option D is $846.51, which is close but not exact. Did I do something wrong?

Wait, perhaps the time is calculated as 8 days, but maybe the formula uses 360 days, so perhaps the discount is 850 * 0.05 * (8/360). Alternatively, perhaps the discount is (850 * 5%) * (8/360). Wait, that's the same as what I did. Maybe the bank uses 365 days? Let me check that.

If using 365 days, time would be 8/365 ≈ 0.021918. So 850 * 0.05 =42.5, times 0.021918 is about 42.5 * 0.021918 ≈ 0.9323. So discount ≈ $0.9323.

Then the collection fee is 2.125. So total deductions: 0.9323 +2.125 ≈ 3.0573. So proceeds: 850 -3.0573= 846.9427, approximately $846.94. Still, the closest option is D: $846.51.

Hmm, but perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the collection fee is applied after the discount, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the collection fee is applied to the discounted amount. Let me think. The problem says the bank charges a 1/4% collection fee. I'm assuming that's a fee on the face value, but perhaps it's on the discounted amount.

Wait, perhaps the order is: first compute the discount, then subtract the collection fee. Or maybe it's the other way around. Let me consider both possibilities.

Option 1: Deductions are discount + collection fee on face value.

Proceeds = 850 - discount - collection fee.

Which is what I did earlier: 850 - (discount) - (collection fee). That gives 846.93.

Option 2: Perhaps the collection fee is applied to the discounted amount. So the discount is taken first, then the fee is applied on the discounted amount.

Wait, that would be (850 - discount) * (1 - collection fee rate). Let me try that.

Discount is 0.9444. So 850 -0.9444 = 849.0556. Then the collection fee is 0.25% on this amount. So 849.0556 * 0.0025 = approx 2.1226. So total deductions: 0.9444 +2.1226 ≈ 3.067. So 850 -3.067 = 846.933, same as before. So perhaps that's not the issue.

Alternatively, maybe the collection fee is 0.25% of the amount after discount. So it's (discount) + (collection fee on discounted amount). Let me compute.

Discount is 0.9444. So the discounted amount is 850 - 0.9444 =849.0556. Then the collection fee is 849.0556 *0.0025 =approx 2.1226. So total deductions: 0.9444 +2.1226=3.067. So again, proceeds are 850-3.067=846.933. So same result.

Hmm, the options don't have 846.93. The closest is D:846.51, which is about 0.42 less. So perhaps I made a mistake in the number of days.

Wait, the draft was accepted on May 10, and discounted on July 1. How many days is that?

May 10 to July 1. Let's count the days:

May 10 to May 31: 21 days (since May has 31 days, 31-10=21, but including the 10th? Wait, no. May 10 is the starting day, so from May 11 to May 31 is 21 days.

June has 30 days. So from May 11 to June 30 is 21 +30 =51 days. Then July 1 is the next day, so total days from May 10 to July 1 is 51 +1 =52 days. So the time from July 1 to maturity is 90 days total, but how many days remain.

Wait wait, wait a second. The draft is 90 days after sight. So when the bank accepts it on May 10, the maturity is 90 days later, which is August 8th? Because May 10 +90 days. Let me recount: May 10 is day 0. May has 31 days. So May 10 +20 days is May 30 (since May 10 is day 0, 10 May, 11 May is day 1, so up to 31 May is day 21). So 31 May is day 21. Then adding 90 days: 90-21=69 days remaining.

June has 30 days, so 69 -30=39 days into July. So July 9th is the 39th day of July (since July 1 is day 1). So the maturity is July 9th.

So the draft was discounted on July 1, which is 8 days before maturity (July 1 to July 9 is 8 days). So the discount period is 8 days. So the time factor is 8/360 or 8/365.

Wait, earlier I thought the days between July 1 and July 9 is 8 days. But wait, July 1 is day 0, so from July 1 to July 9 is 8 days (July 2 is day 1, up to July 9 is day 8). So yes, 8 days.

So the discount is 850 * 0.05 * (8/360) = 850 * 0.05 =42.5; 42.5 * (8/360) = 42.5 * 0.022222 ≈0.9444.

Then the collection fee is 850 * 0.0025 =2.125.

So 0.9444 +2.125 =3.0694. Subtract from 850: 850-3.0694=846.9306.

But the options don't have this exact amount. The closest is D:846.51, which is about 0.42 less. Hmm, maybe I'm making a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the discount is calculated on the present value, not the face value. Let me think. The discount formula is face value multiplied by rate multiplied by time. So that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe the discount is applied first, and then the collection fee is applied on the discounted amount. Let's try that.

Discount: 850 * 0.05 * (8/360) =0.9444. So discounted amount is 850 -0.9444=849.0556.

Then collection fee is 849.0556 * 0.0025= approx 2.1226. So total deductions: 0.9444 +2.1226=3.067. So 850 -3.067=846.933.

Same result. So why is option D at 846.51? Maybe the time is calculated differently. For example, perhaps the days are 9 instead of 8? Let me recalculate.

If the time is 9 days, then discount is 850 *0.05 * (9/360)=850*0.05=42.5; 42.5*(9/360)=42.5*0.025=1.0625. So discount is $1.0625.

Collection fee is 2.125. So total deductions: 1.0625 +2.125=3.1875. Proceeds:850-3.1875=846.8125. That's about 846.81. Still, option D is 846.51.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the time is calculated as 10 days. Let me check. If from July 1 to July 9 is 8 days, or 9 days.

Wait, July 1 is the day the draft is discounted. So the time until maturity is 8 days, as before. So why is the answer not matching exactly?

Wait, perhaps the collection fee is calculated differently. Let me recheck the collection fee.

The collection fee is (1/4)% which is 0.25%. So 0.25% of $850 is 850 *0.0025=2.125. That's correct.

Wait, maybe the order is different. Maybe the collection fee is applied first, then the discount. Let me try that.

Collection fee: 850 *0.0025=2.125. So 850 -2.125=847.875.

Then discount on 847.875: 847.875 *0.05 * (8/360) =?

Compute 847.875 *0.05=42.39375. Then multiply by 8/360: 42.39375 * (8/360) = 42.39375 *0.022222≈0.9407.

So total deductions: 2.125 +0.9407=3.0657. So proceeds=850-3.0657=846.9343. Same as before.

Hmm, no difference. So why is the option D at 846.51, which is lower?

Alternatively, perhaps the discount rate is applied to the face value, but the time is the number of days from the date of discounting to maturity, which is 8 days, but the formula uses 360 days. So 8/360 is correct.

Wait, let me compute the discount again.

Discount = 850 *0.05*(8/360) =850 *0.05=42.5. 42.5*(8/360)= (42.5*8)/360=340/360=0.9444. So discount is $0.9444.

Then collection fee is 850 *0.0025= $2.125.

Total deductions: 0.9444+2.125=3.0694. So proceeds=850 -3.0694=846.9306.

So $846.93, but the options don't have this. So perhaps I'm miscalculating the days.

Wait, maybe the days from July 1 to July 9 is 9 days, not 8. Because July 1 is day 0, July 2 is day 1, up to July 9 is day 8. So 8 days, correct. So why is the answer D:846.51?

Wait, perhaps the interest is calculated using 360 days, but the days are counted as 8 days, but the discount is (850 * 5%) for those 8 days. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation uses exact days but the rate is applied as simple interest.

Wait, perhaps the formula is: discount = face value × rate × (time in days / 360). So that's correct.

Wait, maybe the problem is that the collection fee is applied to the discounted amount, not the face value. Let me see.

Proceeds after discount: 850 - discount.

Discount is 850 * 0.05 * (8/360) =0.9444. So proceeds before fee: 849.0556.

Then collection fee is 849.0556 *0.0025=2.1226.

So total proceeds: 849.0556 -2.1226=846.933. Same as before.

Hmm, same result.

Wait, perhaps the question is using 365 days for the calculation. Let me try that.

Discount =850 *0.05*(8/365)=850*0.05=42.5. 42.5*(8/365)= 42.5 *0.021918≈0.9323. So discount is approx $0.9323.

Collection fee is 2.125. So total deductions: 0.9323 +2.125=3.0573. Proceeds:850-3.0573=846.9427.

Still around 846.94. So none of the options match exactly. But the closest is D: $846.51. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the days calculation.

Wait, perhaps the time from May 10 to July 1 is 52 days, and the total term is 90 days, so the remaining days are 90-52=38 days. But no, because the term is after sight, so the 90 days starts on May 10, so the maturity is August 8th.

Wait wait, wait a second. I think I messed up the maturity date earlier. Let's recalculate the maturity date correctly.

If the draft is after sight for 90 days, and it's accepted on May 10, the maturity date is 90 days after May 10. So May has 31 days, so from May 10, adding 90 days.

May 10 to May 31: 21 days (since 31-10=21, but including the 10th? No, because May 10 is the start, so 21 days brings us to May 31. So 90-21=69 days left.

June has 30 days, so 69-30=39 days into July. So July 9th is the 39th day (July 1 is day 1, so July 9 is day 39). So the maturity is July 9.

So from July 1 (date of discounting) to July 9: that's 8 days. So 8 days is correct.

Wait, perhaps the discounting is done on July 1, so the time is 8 days. But perhaps the days are counted as 9 because it includes both the start and end dates? No, usually, in these calculations, the end date is not included. So if you have a maturity on July 9, the time from July 1 to July 9 is 8 days.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck. Maybe there's another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is treating the 90-day period as starting from the date of discounting. No, that can't be right. The draft is accepted on May 10, so the term is 90
