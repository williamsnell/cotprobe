Okay, so I have this question about defining culture and understanding what Benedict meant by cultural relativity. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my anthropology terms, but let me think this through.

First, the question is asking two things: to define culture and explain Benedict's cultural relativity. But looking at the options, it seems the main focus is on the second part about Benedict. So maybe the first part is just context.

I remember that Benedict was an anthropologist, part of the Boasian school, right? She wrote "Patterns of Culture." Cultural relativity is a concept where you don't judge other cultures by your own standards. So it's about understanding a culture on its own terms.

Let me go through the options one by one.

Option A: Cultural relativity is comparing practices without bias. That sounds a bit like what I'm thinking, but I'm not sure if that's the exact definition. It's more about not judging, rather than just comparing.

Option B: Believes own culture is superior. No, that's the opposite. That's ethnocentrism, not relativity.

Option C: Economic system for cultural goods. Doesn't sound right. That's more economics or maybe material culture, not Benedict's idea.

Option D: Culture is inherited genetically. No, culture is learned, not genetic. So that's not it.

Option E: Study of cultural differences. That's more like comparative anthropology, but not specifically relativity.

Option F: Behavior understood within its cultural context. Yeah, this rings a bell. Cultural relativity is about evaluating behaviors within their own culture, not imposing your own values.

Option G: Adaptation to environment. That's more like cultural adaptation or maybe Darwinian concepts, not relativity.

Option H: Study of culture transmission via language/symbols. That's more about how culture is passed on, not the theory of relativity.

Option I: All cultures are equal. While related, cultural relativity doesn't necessarily say all are equal, just that they shouldn't be judged by another's standards. So it's more about perspective than equality.

Option J: Adopting foreign elements. Thatâ€™s acculturation or diffusion, not relativity.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be F. Cultural relativity is the belief that behavior must be understood within its cultural context.

The correct answer is F: Cultural relativity is the belief that human behavior can only be understood and evaluated within the context of its cultural environment.
