Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question in front of me. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my cardiology, but I'll try to think it through.

The patient is a 47-year-old man who comes to the emergency department with sudden onset of shortness of breath, chest pain, and sweating. These symptoms started two hours ago, and he's never had anything like this before. His history includes hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide, which is a diuretic. He's a heavy smokerâ€”1 pack a day for 30 years, so that's a significant smoking history.

Looking at the vital signs: pulse is 110/min, which is tachycardic. Respirations are 24/min, also a bit elevated. Blood pressure is 110/50 mmHg. That diastolic number is quite low, so the pulse pressure is high. High pulse pressure can be a sign of aortic regurgitation, I remember that.

Physical exam findings: a grade 3/6 diastolic blowing murmur heard over the left sternal border, radiating to the right. Diastolic murmurs are often associated with aortic or pulmonary valve issues. The description makes me think of aortic regurgitation because the murmur is blowing and diastolic. In aortic regurgitation, the murmur is typically heard best at the left sternal border, maybe even radiating to the right. Also, the femoral pulses are decreased bilaterally. That's interesting because in aortic regurgitation, you might see increased pulse pressure and bounding pulses, but decreased femoral pulses... Hmm, maybe it's something else. Or perhaps it's related to another issue.

The ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). LVH can be due to hypertension or valvular issues like aortic stenosis or regurgitation. His BP is 110/50, so not extremely high now, but he does have a history of hypertension.

Now, the question is asking for the most likely diagnosis. Let's go through the options.

Option A: Acute myocardial infarction. He's presenting with chest pain and sweating, which can be signs of MI. But his ECG shows LVH, not necessarily signs of ischemia unless we have more info. Also, the murmur is diastolic, which isn't typical for MI unless there's a mechanical complication like papillary muscle rupture, which would cause mitral regurgitation (systolic murmur). So not sure, but maybe not the first choice.

Option B: Congestive heart failure. Could present with shortness of breath, but the acute onset and the murmur might point more towards a valvular issue. CHF can have murmurs, but the description here is more specific.

Option C: Angina pectoris. Unstable angina could cause chest pain, but it usually doesn't cause a diastolic murmur. Plus, the other symptoms like murmur and decreased femoral pulses might not fit. So probably not.

Option D: Aortic dissection. A classic presentation is sudden, severe chest pain, often tearing in nature. The patient's chest pain is severe, and aortic dissection can cause aortic regurgitation if it involves the aortic valve. Also, decreased femoral pulses could be due to involvement of the descending aorta, leading to compromised blood flow to the lower extremities. However, the presence of a diastolic murmur suggests aortic regurgitation, which could be due to dissection. So this is a possibility.

Option E: Mitral valve prolapse. That usually causes a systolic click and a late systolic murmur. Doesn't fit the diastolic murmur here. So probably not.

Option F: Esophageal rupture. That's more about GI symptoms, maybe chest pain after vomiting, but it doesn't explain the murmur or the decreased femoral pulses. So unlikely.

Option G: Hypertensive crisis. He does have a history of hypertension, but his current BP is 110/50, which isn't that high. A hypertensive crisis typically has much higher BP, so maybe not the primary issue here.

Option H: Thoracic aortic aneurysm. If it's ruptured, it could present similarly to dissection. But again, the murmur is pointing towards a valve issue. An aneurysm without dissection might not cause the murmur unless it's affecting the aortic root, which would lead to regurgitation.

Option I: Pulmonary embolism. Presents with sudden shortness of breath, chest pain, and tachycardia. But it doesn't typically cause diastolic murmurs. The murmur in PE is more likely to be due to increased flow through the pulmonary valve, maybe causing a systolic ejection murmur. Plus, decreased femoral pulses are more about aortic issues, not PE.

Option J: Aortic stenosis. Aortic stenosis causes a systolic ejection murmur, not diastolic. So that's not matching the physical exam.

Going back to the options, the key points are the diastolic blowing murmur and the decreased femoral pulses. A diastolic murmur suggests aortic regurgitation. But why would femoral pulses be decreased? In aortic regurgitation, you might expect increased pulse pressure and bounding pulses. Wait, but in this case, the femoral pulses are decreased. That doesn't quite fit with aortic regurgitation alone.

Wait, what if it's aortic dissection? If the dissection involves the ascending aorta, it can cause aortic regurgitation (leading to the diastolic murmur). The dissection could also extend to the descending aorta, leading to impaired blood flow to the lower extremities, hence decreased femoral pulses. That would explain all the findings: the chest pain (from dissection), the diastolic murmur (from aortic regurgitation), and the decreased femoral pulses (from aortic involvement below the level of the dissection).

So the most likely diagnosis is aortic dissection. Looking back at the options, that's option D.

Alternatively, could it be something else? Let's think about acute myocardial infarction. If the MI led to a papillary muscle rupture, you'd get a new systolic murmur, not diastolic. So that's not matching.

Another thought: the patient has been on hydrochlorothiazide, which is a diuretic, so maybe dehydration? But that wouldn't explain the murmur or the chest pain.

Wait, the blood pressure is 110/50, which is a wide pulse pressure? Wait, no, 110-50 is 60, which is normal. Wait, no. Wait, in aortic regurgitation, the pulse pressure is high, meaning a wide difference between systolic and diastolic. Here, the diastolic is low, so 110-50 is 60, which is a high pulse pressure. Oh, so that fits with aortic regurgitation. But then why the decreased femoral pulses?

Hmm. Oh, wait, if the patient has aortic regurgitation, you would expect bounding peripheral pulses, like in a water-hammer pulse. So decreased femoral pulses don't fit. Unless there's another issue. Like a dissection causing decreased flow in the lower extremities.

Putting it all together, the most likely scenario is an aortic dissection that has caused aortic regurgitation, leading to the diastolic murmur. The dissection has compromised blood flow to the femoral arteries, causing decreased pulses. The chest pain is classic for dissection, and the ECG shows LVH, which is consistent with long-standing hypertension, a risk factor for aortic dissection.

So the answer should be D: Aortic dissection.

The patient is a 47-year-old man presenting with sudden onset of shortness of breath, chest pain, and sweating. His history includes hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide and heavy smoking (1 pack/day for 30 years). Vital signs reveal tachycardia (110/min), tachypnea (24/min), and a blood pressure of 110/50 mmHg, indicating a high pulse pressure. Physical examination shows a grade 3/6 diastolic blowing murmur over the left sternal border, radiating to the right, and decreased femoral pulses bilaterally. The ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH).

The diastolic blowing murmur is characteristic of aortic regurgitation, which can be caused by aortic dissection involving the aortic root. The high pulse pressure (110/50 mmHg) further supports aortic regurgitation. However, the decreased femoral pulses are unusual for isolated aortic regurgitation, as it typically presents with bounding peripheral pulses. This discrepancy suggests another underlying issue, such as aortic dissection, which can impair blood flow to the lower extremities if the dissection involves the descending aorta.

Aortic dissection is also consistent with the sudden, severe chest pain and the patient's risk factors, including hypertension and smoking. The dissection could lead to aortic regurgitation by involving the aortic valve, explaining the diastolic murmur. The ECG showing LVH aligns with the patient's history of hypertension, a known risk factor for aortic dissection.

Other options are less likely:  
- **Acute myocardial infarction (A)**: Typically presents with a systolic murmur if there is a mechanical complication, not a diastolic murmur.  
- **Congestive heart failure (B)**: Unlikely given the acute onset and specific findings of a diastolic murmur.  
- **Angina pectoris (C)**: Does not explain the diastolic murmur or decreased femoral pulses.  
- **Mitral valve prolapse (E)**: Causes a systolic click and late systolic murmur, not a diastolic murmur.  
- **Esophageal rupture (F)**: Presents with GI symptoms and does not explain the murmur or decreased femoral pulses.  
- **Hypertensive crisis (G)**: The patient's blood pressure is not excessively high, and this does not explain the murmur.  
- **Thoracic aortic aneurysm (H)**: Less likely without evidence of rupture or involvement of the aortic root.  
- **Pulmonary embolism (I)**: Typically presents with a systolic ejection murmur, not a diastolic murmur.  
- **Aortic stenosis (J)**: Causes a systolic ejection murmur, not a diastolic murmur.

The most likely diagnosis is **aortic dissection**, as it explains the sudden chest pain, diastolic murmur (due to aortic regurgitation), decreased femoral pulses, and the patient's risk factors.
