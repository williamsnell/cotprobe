B: The pollsters are 95% confident that the true proportion is between 38% and 48%.
C: Five percent of the students refused to participate in the poll.
D: The poll's results could be 5% higher or lower due to random chance.
E: Five percent of the students surveyed did not understand the question.
F: There is a 5% chance that the results of the poll are completely inaccurate.

H: It is likely that the true proportion of high school students afraid to go to school is between 38% and 48%.
I: The poll's results are 5% away from the true proportion.

Okay, so I've got this question about a poll's margin of error. I'm a bit fuzzy on statistics, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question says that a May 1999 poll reported 43% of high school students feared going to school, and this poll had a margin of error of 5%. I need to figure out what that means.

I remember that margin of error is related to confidence intervals. So, the margin of error is like the range around the sample proportion where the true population proportion is likely to be. But wait, how does that work exactly?

Let me think. When you take a sample, say a poll of students, you get a sample proportion, which is 43% here. But the actual proportion in the whole population (all high school students) might be a bit different. The margin of error tells us how much we expect this sample result to vary from the true value.

I think the margin of error is usually calculated using the standard error and a critical value from a distribution, often the Z distribution for large samples. So, the formula for the margin of error (ME) is something like ME = Z * (sqrt(p*(1-p)/n)), where p is the sample proportion and n is the sample size.

But the question is asking what a 5% margin of error means. So, the key here is understanding what the margin of error represents in terms of confidence. I believe that a 5% margin of error typically corresponds to a 95% confidence interval. Because in statistics, the common confidence levels are 90%, 95%, and 99%, and each has a corresponding Z score. For 95%, the Z is about 1.96.

Wait, but how does the confidence interval work? If the margin of error is 5%, then the confidence interval would be the sample proportion plus or minus that margin. So 43% plus or minus 5% gives a range of 38% to 48%. And the 95% confidence means that if we were to take many samples, 95% of them would have a proportion within this range around the true proportion.

So, looking at the options, I need to find the one that correctly describes this. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: There's a 0.05 probability the result is wrong. Hmm, no, that's not right. The 0.05 is the significance level, which is related to the confidence level but not the probability that the result is in error. The margin of error isn't about the probability of the result being wrong; it's about the range of likely true values.

Option B: Pollsters are 95% confident the true proportion is between 38% and 48%. This sounds correct because the margin of error is 5%, so adding and subtracting 5 from 43 gives 38-48, and that's the 95% confidence interval. So this looks like a good option.

Option C: 5% refused to participate. No, that's about non-response bias, not the margin of error. The margin of error deals with sampling error, not participation rates.

Option D: Results could be 5% higher or lower due to chance. This is somewhat correct but maybe not precise. The range is 5% on either side, so higher or lower by up to 5. But does it mean the results themselves have a 5% chance? Or is it about the interval? I think the wording is a bit off. It's not that the results themselves have a 5% chance, but that the true value lies within that range with 95% confidence.

Option E: 5% didn't understand. No, that's about question comprehension, not the statistical margin.

Option F: 5% chance the results are completely wrong. No, that's not what margin of error means. It's not about the entire result being wrong, but a range around the estimate.

Option G: Only 5% gave valid responses. No, that's about data quality, not the statistical error margin.

Option H: It's likely the true proportion is between 38-48. This is similar to option B, because 95% confidence implies that it's likely. So H says it's likely, which is a bit more general. But I think B is more precise because it mentions the 95% confidence.

Option I: Results are 5% away from the true proportion. That's a bit misleading. It's not that the results are exactly 5% off, but that the true value is within 5% of the estimate, with 95% confidence.

Option J: 38-48% surveyed expressed fear. No, because the 38-48 is the interval for the true proportion, not the sample surveyed. The sample was 43%, and the interval is about the population.

So, now I'm deciding between B and H. Option B says the pollsters are 95% confident that the true proportion is in that range. H says it's likely. Which is more accurate?

The margin of error is typically part of a confidence interval, which is a range of values within which we expect the true value to lie, based on our confidence level. So, when they say 5% margin of error, it's usually for a 95% confidence level. So option B is the precise statement, whereas H is a bit more vague. But wait, the question is asking what the 5% margin of error means. So, the best description is that the true proportion lies between 38 and 48 with 95% confidence, which is option B.

Wait, but in the options, H says "it is likely that the true proportion..." which is a bit more of a layman's terms. But in statistical terms, the precise answer is B because it connects the 95% confidence with the interval.

So I think the correct answer is B.

The question asks about the meaning of a 5% margin of error in a poll where 43% of high school students expressed fear about going to school. The margin of error is a statistical concept that represents the range around the sample proportion within which the true population proportion is likely to lie. Typically, a 5% margin of error corresponds to a 95% confidence interval, meaning that if many samples were taken, 95% of them would yield proportions within this range.

Analyzing the options:

- **A** is incorrect because the margin of error is not the probability that the result is in error but rather the range of likely values for the true proportion.
- **B** is correct because it accurately states that the pollsters are 95% confident the true proportion is between 38% and 48%, which aligns with the definition of a 5% margin of error.
- **C, E, G, and J** are unrelated to the margin of error and instead describe issues like non-response, comprehension, data quality, or misinterpretation of the sample results.
- **D** is somewhat correct but imprecise, as it suggests the results themselves have a 5% chance of varying, rather than the true proportion lying within a range.
- **F** is incorrect because it misrepresents the margin of error as a 5% chance of the results being completely inaccurate.
- **H** is close, as it states that the true proportion is likely between 38% and 48%, but it is less precise than **B**, which explicitly mentions the 95% confidence level.
- **I** is misleading because it implies the results are exactly 5% away from the true proportion, which is not the correct interpretation.

The best answer is **B**, as it provides the most accurate and precise description of what a 5% margin of error means in this context.

**Answer: B**
