Question:

An automobile battery produces a potential difference (or "voltage") of 12 volts between its terminals. (It really consists of six 2 volt batteries following one after the other.) A headlightbulb is to be connected directly across the terminals of the battery and dissipate 40 watts of joule heat. What current will it draw and what must its resistance be?

Options:

A: 3.0 amps, 4 ohms
B: 2.8 amps, 3.2 ohms
C: 3.75 amps, 3.2 ohms
D: 4 amps, 3 ohms
E: 3.33 amps, 3.6 ohms
F: 5 amps, 2.4 ohms
G: 4.5 amps, 2.67 ohms
H: 2.2 amps, 5.45 ohms
I: 2.5 amps, 4.8 ohms
J: 3.5 amps, 4 ohms

Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about an automobile battery and a headlight bulb. Let me try to work through it step by step. Hmm, the battery is 12 volts, right? And the bulb is connected directly across the terminals, so it's using the full 12V.

The question is asking two things: what current will the bulb draw, and what must its resistance be. Oh, and they give the power dissipated as 40 watts. So I think I need to use the power formulas here.

Wait, power in electricity... I remember that power (P) is related to voltage (V) and current (I) by the formula P = V * I. And also, another formula relates power to current and resistance: P = I² * R. Oh, right, and Ohm's law says V = I * R.

So first, maybe I can find the current using the first formula. The power is 40 W, voltage 12 V. So rearranging P=VI, I = P/V. Let me calculate that: I = 40 /12. What's 40 divided by 12? That's 3 and 1/3, which is approximately 3.333... amps. So like 3.33 amps.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me see. Option E is 3.33 amps and 3.6 ohms. Option D is 4 amps, 3 ohms. Hmm, but wait, maybe I should find the resistance next.

So using Ohm's law, V=IR. Once I have I, I can find R. Or alternatively, using the other power formula: P = V² / R. Because I know P and V, so R = V² / P.

Let's try that. R = (12 V)^2 / 40 W. 12 squared is 144. 144 divided by 40 is... 3.6 ohms. Oh, that matches option E, which has 3.6 ohms.

Wait, so putting it together, the current is 40 /12 = 3.333... A, and resistance is 3.6 ohms. So option E: 3.33 amps,3.6 ohms.

Let me double-check. If the bulb has a resistance of 3.6 ohms at 12 volts, the current is 12/3.6 = 3.333... A. Power is I² R: (3.333)^2 *3.6 ≈ (11.11)*3.6 ≈ 40 W. Yep, that makes sense. So option E is correct.

To solve the problem, we start by using the relationship between power, voltage, and current: 

\[
P = V \cdot I \quad \Rightarrow \quad I = \frac{P}{V}
\]

Given \( P = 40 \, \text{W} \) and \( V = 12 \, \text{V} \), the current is:

\[
I = \frac{40}{12} = 3.333\ldots \, \text{A} \, \text{(or approximately 3.33 A)}.
\]

Next, we use Ohm's law to find the resistance:

\[
V = I \cdot R \quad \Rightarrow \quad R = \frac{V}{I}
\]

Substituting \( V = 12 \, \text{V} \) and \( I = 3.333 \, \text{A} \):

\[
R = \frac{12}{3.333} \approx 3.6 \, \Omega.
\]

Thus, the headlight bulb draws a current of approximately \( 3.33 \, \text{A} \) and has a resistance of \( 3.6 \, \Omega \). Comparing these values to the options provided, the correct answer is:

**E: 3.33 amps, 3.6 ohms.**
