Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. The question is about calculating the change in specific entropy of 1 lbm of air when it's compressed from one state to another. The initial state is 14 psia and 60°F, and the final state is 84 psia and 460°F. The options are given from A to J, and I need to pick the right one.

Hmm, I remember that entropy change can be calculated using the formula for an ideal gas. The formula I think is Δs = Cp ln(T2/T1) - R ln(P2/P1), where Cp is the specific heat at constant pressure, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in absolute units, like Rankine.

Wait, right, because entropy is a state function, the change only depends on the initial and final states, not the path. So I can use the ideal gas equations here since air can be considered an ideal gas for many engineering applications.

First, I need to convert the temperatures from Fahrenheit to Rankine. To convert, I add 459.67 to the Fahrenheit temperature. So T1 is 60 + 459.67 = 519.67 °R, and T2 is 460 + 459.67 = 919.67 °R.

Next, the pressures are given in psia. I think for the entropy formula, the pressure ratio is what matters, so I can use psia directly since the ratio will be unitless. So P1 is 14 psia, P2 is 84 psia. The ratio P2/P1 is 84/14 = 6.

Now, I need Cp and R for air. I remember that for air, the specific heat at constant pressure, Cp, is about 0.24 BTU/lbm·°R. Wait, wait, no, maybe it's 0.24 in BTU per pound mass per Rankine? Or is that per mole? No, wait, no, I'm pretty sure it's 0.24 BTU/lbm·°R. And the gas constant R for air is about 53.35 ft·lbf/lbm·°R, but wait, how does that convert to BTU units?

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think. The gas constant R for air is 53.35 ft·lbf/lbm·R. But since 1 BTU is 778 ft·lbf, so R in terms of BTU would be 53.35 / 778 ≈ 0.0686 BTU/lbm·R. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. So 1 BTU equals approximately 778 foot-pounds-force. So yes, R would be 53.35 / 778. Let me calculate that: 53.35 ÷ 778 ≈ 0.0686 BTU/lbm·R.

So now, putting it all into the formula. Δs = Cp ln(T2/T1) - R ln(P2/P1). Plugging in the values:

Cp is 0.24, T2 is 919.67, T1 is 519.67. So T2/T1 is 919.67 / 519.67 ≈ 1.77. The natural log of 1.77 is... Hmm, I think ln(1.77) is about 0.57. Let me check: ln(1.6) is about 0.47, ln(1.8) is about 0.587. So 1.77 is close to 1.8, maybe around 0.57.

Then, the first term is 0.24 * 0.57 ≈ 0.1368.

The second term is R * ln(P2/P1). R is 0.0686, and ln(6) is about 1.792. So 0.0686 * 1.792 ≈ 0.123.

So the entropy change is 0.1368 - 0.123 ≈ 0.0138 BTU/°R. Wait, but looking at the options, the closest one is H: 0.01416, which is about 0.0142. That's really close to my calculation of 0.0138, which I approximated. Maybe a more precise calculation would get exactly to 0.01416.

Wait, perhaps I made some approximations. Let me redo the calculations more accurately.

First, T2 = 460°F = 460 + 459.67 = 919.67 °R.

T1 = 60°F = 60 + 459.67 = 519.67 °R.

T2/T1 is 919.67 / 519.67 ≈ Let me compute that exactly. 919.67 divided by 519.67. Let me compute 519.67 × 1.77: 519.67 * 1.7 is 883.139, 519.67*0.07=36.3769, so 883.139 +36.3769=919.5159. Very close to 919.67, so T2/T1 is approximately 1.77.

So ln(1.77) is let me compute more accurately. Using calculator-like steps: ln(1.77) ≈ 0.570.

Then Cp is 0.24, so 0.24 * 0.570 = 0.1368.

Now, P2/P1 is 84/14=6. So ln(6)=1.791759.

R is 53.35 ft·lbf/lbm·R. To convert to BTU/lbm·R: since 1 BTU=778.169 ft·lbf, R = 53.35 / 778.169 ≈ Let's calculate this accurately.

53.35 ÷ 778.169: Let me compute 53.35 ÷ 778.169. 778.169 × 0.0686 ≈ 53.35. Let me check: 778 × 0.0686 = 778 * 0.06 = 46.68; 778 * 0.0086 ≈ 6.69. So 46.68 + 6.69 = 53.37, which is very close to 53.35. So R ≈ 0.0686 BTU/lbm·R.

So R * ln(6) = 0.0686 * 1.791759 ≈ Let's compute that.

0.0686 * 1.791759. Let's do 0.0686 * 1.79 = 0.0686 *1=0.0686, 0.0686 *0.79=0.0542. So total 0.0686 + 0.0542=0.1228.

So the entropy change is 0.1368 - 0.1228 = 0.014 BTU/°R.

Looking at the options, option H is 0.01416, which is really close. So that must be the correct answer.

To calculate the change in specific entropy of 1 lbm of air when it is compressed from 14 psia, 60°F to 84 psia, and 460°F, we use the formula for entropy change of an ideal gas:

\[
\Delta s = C_p \ln\left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right) - R \ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)
\]

### Step 1: Convert temperatures to Rankine
- Initial temperature: \( T_1 = 60 + 459.67 = 519.67 \, ^\circ\text{R} \)
- Final temperature: \( T_2 = 460 + 459.67 = 919.67 \, ^\circ\text{R} \)

### Step 2: Calculate the temperature ratio
\[
\frac{T_2}{T_1} = \frac{919.67}{519.67} \approx 1.77
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the pressure ratio
\[
\frac{P_2}{P_1} = \frac{84}{14} = 6
\]

### Step 4: Use thermodynamic properties of air
- Specific heat at constant pressure: \( C_p = 0.24 \, \text{BTU/lbm} \cdot ^\circ\text{R} \)
- Gas constant for air: \( R = \frac{53.35}{778.169} \approx 0.0686 \, \text{BTU/lbm} \cdot ^\circ\text{R} \)

### Step 5: Compute entropy change
1. First term: \( C_p \ln\left(\frac{T_2}{T_1}\right) = 0.24 \ln(1.77) \)
   - \( \ln(1.77) \approx 0.570 \)
   - \( 0.24 \times 0.570 = 0.1368 \, \text{BTU/}^\circ\text{R} \)

2. Second term: \( R \ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right) = 0.0686 \ln(6) \)
   - \( \ln(6) \approx 1.792 \)
   - \( 0.0686 \times 1.792 \approx 0.1228 \, \text{BTU/}^\circ\text{R} \)

3. Entropy change:
\[
\Delta s = 0.1368 - 0.1228 = 0.014 \, \text{BTU/}^\circ\text{R}
\]

### Step 6: Match the closest option
The calculated entropy change \( \Delta s \approx 0.014 \, \text{BTU/}^\circ\text{R} \) is closest to option **H: 0.01416**.
