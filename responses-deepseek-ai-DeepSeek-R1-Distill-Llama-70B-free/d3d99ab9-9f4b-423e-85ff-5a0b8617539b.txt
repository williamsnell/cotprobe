Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The question involves the decomposition of SO2Cl2 into SO2 and Cl2. The reaction is given as SO2Cl2 → SO2 + Cl2. The problem states that the half-life of this reaction is 8.0 minutes. The question is asking, how much time will it take for the concentration of SO2Cl2 to reduce to 1.0% of its original value.

Hmm, I remember that the half-life is the time it takes for the concentration of a substance to reduce by half. But wait, the exact number of half-lives needed to get to 1% might be tricky. Let me think about this.

So, the formula for radioactive decay (and I think chemical reactions with a half-life work the same way) is N(t) = N0 * (1/2)^(t / t_half). Here, N(t) is the remaining quantity after time t, N0 is the initial quantity, and t_half is the half-life.

In this case, N(t) is 1% of N0, which is 0.01 times N0. So we can set up the equation:

0.01 = (1/2)^(t / 8)

I need to solve for t. Let's take the natural logarithm of both sides to get rid of the exponent. Wait, but taking log base 2 might be easier here, but natural log is more familiar.

Taking natural logs:

ln(0.01) = (t / 8) * ln(1/2)

I know that ln(1/2) is approximately -0.6931. Let me plug in the numbers.

ln(0.01) is ln(1/100) which is -4.6052.

So,

-4.6052 = (t / 8) * (-0.6931)

Let me rearrange this. Multiply both sides by 8:

-4.6052 * 8 = t * (-0.6931)

Calculating the left side: 4.6052 *8 is about 36.8416, but since it's negative, it's -36.8416.

So,

-36.8416 = -0.6931 * t

Divide both sides by -0.6931:

t = (-36.8416) / (-0.6931) ≈ 53.06 minutes.

Wait, so approximately 53 minutes. Looking at the options, option F is 53 minutes. So that's the answer.

But wait, let me make sure. Another way to think about it: Each half-life reduces the concentration by half. So, how many half-lives does it take to get to 1%?

Starting at 100%, after 1 half-life (8 mins) → 50%
After 2 → 25%
3 → 12.5%
4 → 6.25%
5 → 3.125%
6 → 1.5625%
Wait, that's 6 half-lives. 6 *8=48 mins. But that would bring it down to ~1.56%, which is more than 1%. So maybe I need to go a bit further.

Wait, but the formula is more precise. So with 6 half-lives, it's 1.56%, and the question is when it's 1%. So maybe a little more than 6 half-lives. Let's see: 6 half-lives is 48 mins, and 53 is 6.625 half-lives (53/8=6.625). So 1/(2^6.625) is 1/(2^6 * 2^0.625) = 1/(64 * 1.542) ≈ 1/98.928, which is approximately 1.01%, which is very close to 1%. So yes, about 53 minutes.

Therefore, the correct answer should be F: 53 minutes.

To determine the time required for the concentration of SO₂Cl₂ to reduce to 1.0% of its original value, we use the half-life formula:

\[
N(t) = N_0 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\frac{t}{t_{\text{half}}}}
\]

Here:
- \( N(t) = 0.01 \cdot N_0 \) (since 1.0% of the original concentration remains),
- \( t_{\text{half}} = 8.0 \, \text{minutes} \).

Substituting into the equation:

\[
0.01 = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{\frac{t}{8}}
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
\ln(0.01) = \frac{t}{8} \cdot \ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)
\]

Using \(\ln(0.01) = -4.6052\) and \(\ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = -0.6931\):

\[
-4.6052 = \frac{t}{8} \cdot (-0.6931)
\]

Rearranging:

\[
t = \frac{-4.6052}{-0.6931} \cdot 8 \approx 53.06 \, \text{minutes}.
\]

Thus, the time required for the concentration of SO₂Cl₂ to reduce to 1.0% is approximately **53 minutes**. This matches option **F**.
