Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The problem says: There's a solid sphere with a moment of inertia of 0.06 kg·m². It's spinning freely around an axis through its center at an angular speed of 20 rad/s. We need to bring it to rest by applying a friction force of 2.0 N to the outer surface. The distance from the center where the force is applied is 0.30 m. The question is asking how much time it'll take for the sphere to come to rest. The options are from A to J, with various times given.

Hmm, okay, so this is a rotational motion problem involving torque and angular acceleration. I remember that torque causes angular acceleration, and friction is providing that torque here. Since the sphere is spinning freely, when we apply this friction force, it'll slow it down until it stops.

First, I think I need to find the angular acceleration caused by the frictional torque. Once I have that, I can figure out how long it takes to go from the initial angular velocity to zero.

Let me jot down the given values:

Moment of inertia, I = 0.06 kg·m².
Initial angular velocity, ω_initial = 20 rad/s.
Friction force, F = 2.0 N.
Radius, r = 0.30 m.
I know that torque τ is equal to I times angular acceleration α (τ = Iα). But torque is also equal to the force multiplied by the radius (τ = Fr). So combining these, Fr = Iα. That means α = Fr / I.

Wait, but wait. The friction force is causing a torque which is trying to slow down the rotation. So the angular acceleration here would be a deceleration, meaning it's negative in sign if we take the initial rotation as positive. But since we're dealing with magnitudes for time, maybe the sign won't matter much here.

So let me compute the torque first. Torque τ = F * r = 2.0 N * 0.30 m = 0.6 N·m.

Then, using τ = Iα, solving for α gives α = τ / I = 0.6 / 0.06. Let me do that division. 0.6 divided by 0.06 is 10. So α is 10 rad/s². But since it's slowing down, the angular acceleration is negative, so α = -10 rad/s².

Now, I need to find the time it takes to go from ω_initial = 20 rad/s to ω_final = 0. The kinematic equation for rotational motion that applies here is ω_final = ω_initial + α * t. Because it's uniformly accelerated (or decelerated) motion.

Plugging in the known values: 0 = 20 + (-10) * t. So 0 = 20 -10t. Let's solve for t. Adding 10t to both sides gives 10t = 20. So t = 20 / 10 = 2 seconds.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through the steps again.

Torque τ = Fr = 2 * 0.3 = 0.6 Nm. Then α = τ/I = 0.6 / 0.06 = 10 rad/s². But since it's deceleration, α is -10. The equation ω_final = ω_initial + α*t. So 0 = 20 + (-10)*t → 10t=20 → t=2 seconds.

Looking at the options, option D is 2 s. So that's probably the correct answer.

Wait, but let me double-check. Another way to calculate it is using the work-energy principle, but that might be more complicated. Alternatively, using the rotational kinematic equations. The time taken to decelerate from ω to 0 under constant α is t = (ω_initial)/|α|.

So ω_initial is 20 rad/s, α is 10 rad/s². So t = 20 /10 = 2 s. Yep, same result.

I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. So the answer should be D.

To determine how long it takes for the solid sphere to come to rest, we analyze the situation using rotational dynamics. The sphere has a moment of inertia \( I = 0.06 \, \text{kg·m}^2 \), an initial angular velocity \( \omega_{\text{initial}} = 20 \, \text{rad/s} \), and a frictional force \( F = 2.0 \, \text{N} \) applied at a distance \( r = 0.30 \, \text{m} \) from the center. The goal is to calculate the time \( t \) it takes for the sphere to slow to a stop.

### Step 1: Calculate the torque
The torque \( \tau \) caused by the frictional force is given by:
\[
\tau = F \cdot r = 2.0 \, \text{N} \cdot 0.30 \, \text{m} = 0.6 \, \text{N·m}.
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the angular acceleration
Using the relationship \( \tau = I \alpha \), the angular acceleration \( \alpha \) is:
\[
\alpha = \frac{\tau}{I} = \frac{0.6 \, \text{N·m}}{0.06 \, \text{kg·m}^2} = 10 \, \text{rad/s}^2.
\]
Since the frictional force opposes the motion, the angular acceleration is negative:
\[
\alpha = -10 \, \text{rad/s}^2.
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the time to stop
Using the kinematic equation for rotational motion:
\[
\omega_{\text{final}} = \omega_{\text{initial}} + \alpha \cdot t,
\]
where \( \omega_{\text{final}} = 0 \, \text{rad/s} \), \( \omega_{\text{initial}} = 20 \, \text{rad/s} \), and \( \alpha = -10 \, \text{rad/s}^2 \), we solve for \( t \):
\[
0 = 20 + (-10) \cdot t \implies 10 \cdot t = 20 \implies t = \frac{20}{10} = 2 \, \text{s}.
\]

### Final Answer
The time it takes for the sphere to come to rest is **2 seconds**, which corresponds to option **D**.
