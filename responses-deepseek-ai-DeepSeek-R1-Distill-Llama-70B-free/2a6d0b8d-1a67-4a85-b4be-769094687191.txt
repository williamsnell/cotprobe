Okay, so I have this problem about a right triangle, and I need to find its area. Let's see what the question says. The hypotenuse is 10 inches, and one angle is 45 degrees. Hmm, right triangle with one angle 45 degrees. Oh wait, right triangles have one 90 degree angle, so the other two must add up to 90. If one is 45, then the other must also be 45. So this is a 45-45-90 triangle, which makes it an isosceles right triangle. That means both legs are equal in length.

I remember that in a 45-45-90 triangle, the legs are of equal length, and the hypotenuse is leg * sqrt(2). So the formula is hypotenuse = leg * sqrt(2). So if I let the legs be length 'a', then 10 = a * sqrt(2). To find 'a', I can divide both sides by sqrt(2). So a = 10 / sqrt(2). But wait, sometimes people rationalize the denominator. So that would be a = (10 * sqrt(2)) / 2, which simplifies to 5 * sqrt(2). Okay, so each leg is 5√2 inches long.

Now, the area of a triangle is (base * height) / 2. In a right triangle, the two legs serve as base and height. Since both legs are equal, the area would be (5√2 * 5√2) / 2. Let me compute that. 5√2 times 5√2 is 25 * (√2)^2. √2 squared is 2, so 25 * 2 is 50. Then divide by 2, so 50 / 2 is 25. So the area is 25 square inches.

Wait, let me double-check. Another way to think about it: the legs are both 5√2, so when I multiply them, it's (5√2)^2, which is 25 * 2, which is 50. Then divide by 2 for the area, so 25. Yep, that seems right.

Looking at the options, option G is 25. So I think the answer is G.

The problem involves a right triangle with a hypotenuse of 10 inches and one angle measuring \(45^\circ\). Since the triangle is a right triangle, the other non-right angle must also be \(45^\circ\), making it an isosceles right triangle (45-45-90 triangle). In such a triangle, the legs are equal, and the hypotenuse is related to the legs by the formula:

\[
\text{hypotenuse} = \text{leg} \cdot \sqrt{2}.
\]

Let the length of each leg be \(a\). Substituting the hypotenuse value:

\[
10 = a \cdot \sqrt{2}.
\]

Solving for \(a\):

\[
a = \frac{10}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{10 \cdot \sqrt{2}}{2} = 5\sqrt{2}.
\]

The area of a right triangle is given by:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \text{base} \cdot \text{height}.
\]

Here, both the base and height are equal to \(5\sqrt{2}\). Substituting these values:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot (5\sqrt{2}) \cdot (5\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 25 \cdot 2 = 25.
\]

Thus, the area of the triangle is 25 square inches. The correct answer is:

G: 25.
