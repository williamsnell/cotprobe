Alright, I'm trying to figure out how the government supported banks through the formation of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). So, the question is asking about the role of the FDIC in backing the banks. 

I remember that during the Great Depression, there were a lot of bank failures, which led to people losing their savings. This caused panic and runs on the banks because people were afraid their money wasn't safe. So, the government stepped in to restore confidence in the banking system.

The FDIC was created as part of the New Deal policies. The main idea was to insure deposits so that people wouldn't rush to withdraw their money. If deposits were insured, people would feel safer keeping their money in banks, which would prevent more bank failures.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one matches this. Option A talks about increasing taxes on banks. I don't think that's right because increasing taxes would probably hurt banks, not help them. The government is trying to support, not burden them.

Option B is about guaranteeing loans. That sounds more like what the Federal Reserve or other agencies might do, but I'm not sure if that's the FDIC's role. The FDIC is more about deposit insurance.

Option C mentions capping interest rates. That sounds like a regulation to protect borrowers, but again, not directly related to insuring deposits.

Option D is financial grants to banks. I'm not sure if the FDIC gave grants. I think they provided insurance instead of direct financial aid.

Option E is taking over all private banks. That would be nationalization, which I don't think happened. The FDIC was about insurance, not taking over.

Option F says insuring only commercial accounts. No, I think the FDIC insured personal accounts too, not just business ones.

Option G: Protecting all bank deposits with government insurance. That sounds right. The FDIC insured deposits up to a certain amount, so if a bank failed, depositors wouldn't lose their money.

Option H allows unlimited borrowing at zero interest. That might be a central bank function, like the Fed, but not the FDIC's role.

Option I is a one-time bailout. The FDIC wasn't a one-time thing; it's an ongoing insurance program.

Option J is investing in bank stocks. That doesn't sound like what the FDIC did. They insured deposits, not invested in banks.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be G: By protecting all bank deposits with government insurance.
