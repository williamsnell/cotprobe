Okay, so I've got this problem here about the normalized power of a periodic signal. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on some of these concepts, but let me try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the question says the total normalized power is S, which is the sum from n=-infinity to n=+infinity of V_n multiplied by V_n conjugate. So S is the sum of |V_n| squared for all n. Got it. And V_n is given as [1/(|n|)] multiplied by e^(-j arctan(n/2)) for n = ±1, ±2, etc. Oh wait, so V_n is zero when n=0 because 1/|n| would be undefined there. So that term isn't included in the sum.

The problem is asking for the ratio of the normalized power of the second harmonic to the first harmonic. Right, harmonics are the integer multiples of the fundamental frequency, so the first harmonic is n=1, second is n=2, and so on.

So I need to find the power at n=1 and n=2, then take their ratio.

Power for each harmonic, I think, is just |V_n|^2. Because each term in the sum S is |V_n|², so each harmonic's power is that term.

So let's compute |V_1|² and |V_2|².

V_n is [1/|n|] * e^{-j arctan(n/2)}. The magnitude of V_n would be just 1/|n|, because the exponential has a magnitude of 1. So |V_n| is 1/|n|, so |V_n|² is 1/(n²). Because |n| squared is n², regardless of the sign.

Wait, because n can be positive or negative, but since we're squaring, it doesn't matter. So |V_n|² is 1/n².

So for the first harmonic (n=1), the power is 1/1² = 1.

For the second harmonic (n=2), the power is 1/2² = 1/4.

Wait, but wait a second. Because the problem defines V_n for n = ±1, ±2, etc. So each n and -n have the same V_n magnitude, right? Because |V_n| is 1/|n| regardless of whether n is positive or negative. So when we're looking at a particular harmonic, say the first harmonic, does that include both n=1 and n=-1?

Hmm, right. Because in the Fourier series, the coefficients for positive and negative n are complex conjugates, and when you take their magnitudes squared, they contribute the same amount. So each harmonic (like first, second) actually corresponds to two terms in the Fourier series—n=1 and n=-1, n=2 and n=-2, etc.

Wait, no, wait. The way the problem is phrased, the sum is over all n from -infty to +infty, including n=0. But V_0 is zero, so it doesn't contribute. So each harmonic includes the n and -n terms. So for the first harmonic, n=1 and n=-1, each have V_n as 1/1 * e^{-j arctan(1/2)} and 1/1 * e^{-j arctan(-1/2)}. But when you take the magnitude squared, each of these terms contributes |V_1|² and |V_{-1}|², which are both (1/1)^2 = 1. So each harmonic (first, second) has two terms contributing to the power.

Wait no, wait. No, hold on. The question is about the normalized power of each harmonic. So the first harmonic refers to n=1 and n=-1, and the second harmonic refers to n=2 and n=-2.

Wait, but no, in Fourier series, each harmonic is typically a pair of terms—like n and -n. So when someone refers to the first harmonic, they might be talking about the sum of n=1 and n=-1 contributions. But in this problem, when they say "normalized power (first harmonic)", I think each individual n contributes to that harmonic. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, the problem defines the normalized power S as the sum over all n of |V_n|². Since each V_n is for a specific n, each term is |V_n|². So each n is a separate term. So the first harmonic would be for n=1, the second for n=2, etc. But wait, n can be positive and negative. So the first harmonic is n=1 and n=-1, but each is a separate term. So when the question refers to the 'first harmonic' power, does it mean the sum of n=1 and n=-1? Or is each n considered a separate harmonic? Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous.

Wait, let's read the question again. It says, "the normalized power (second harmonic)" and "normalized power (first harmonic)". So the first harmonic is n=1, the second is n=2. So each n corresponds to a harmonic. But wait, no. In Fourier series, the harmonic refers to the frequency: the first harmonic is the fundamental frequency (n=1), the second is twice that (n=2), etc. But each term in the Fourier series for n and -n are at the same frequency (but with opposite phase). So each harmonic (first, second) corresponds to two terms in the sum, n and -n.

But in this problem, each V_n is defined for each integer n (including negative), so each n is a separate term. So the first harmonic (n=1) and (n=-1) would each have their own power. But the way the question is phrased, it's asking for the ratio between the second harmonic's power and the first's. So perhaps each harmonic refers to a specific n, like n=1 is the first, n=2 is the second, and their negative counterparts are perhaps considered as part of those harmonics.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's think about the terms. For each n, |V_n|² is 1/(n²). So, for n=1, |V_1|² is 1, for n=2, it's 1/4. But when considering harmonics, the first harmonic would include both n=1 and n=-1, each contributing 1, so the total power for the first harmonic would be 1 + 1 = 2. Similarly, the second harmonic (n=2 and n=-2) would each contribute 1/4, so their sum is 1/2. Then the ratio would be (1/2) / (2) = 1/4, which is 0.25. Looking at the options, that's option I: 0.25.

But wait, the question might be considering each n as a separate harmonic. Like, the first harmonic is n=1, the second is n=2, so their powers are 1 and 1/4, ratio is 1/4 (0.25). Alternatively, if the first harmonic includes both n=1 and n=-1, then their sum is 2, and the second includes n=2 and n=-2, sum 0.5. So the ratio would be 0.5/2=0.25 as well. Hmm, so either way, the ratio is 0.25. So the correct answer would be I: 0.25.

Wait, but let me double-check. The power for each harmonic (n and -n) is 2*(1/n²). So first harmonic: 2*(1/1²)=2. Second harmonic: 2*(1/2²)=0.5. So ratio is 0.5/2=0.25. So that makes sense.

So the ratio is 0.25, which is option I.

To calculate the ratio of the normalized power of the second harmonic to the first harmonic, we start by noting that the normalized power for each harmonic is proportional to \( |V_n|^2 \), where \( V_n = \frac{1}{|n|} e^{-j \arctan(n/2)} \). The magnitude of \( V_n \) is \( \frac{1}{|n|} \), so \( |V_n|^2 = \frac{1}{n^2} \).

For the first harmonic (\( n = \pm 1 \)), the total power is the sum of contributions from \( n = 1 \) and \( n = -1 \), which is:

\[
|V_1|^2 + |V_{-1}|^2 = \frac{1}{1^2} + \frac{1}{1^2} = 1 + 1 = 2.
\]

For the second harmonic (\( n = \pm 2 \)), the total power is the sum of contributions from \( n = 2 \) and \( n = -2 \), which is:

\[
|V_2|^2 + |V_{-2}|^2 = \frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{1}{2^2} = \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

The ratio of the normalized power of the second harmonic to the first harmonic is:

\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{Power (second harmonic)}}{\text{Power (first harmonic)}} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{2} = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25.
\]

Thus, the correct answer is:

**I: 0.25**
