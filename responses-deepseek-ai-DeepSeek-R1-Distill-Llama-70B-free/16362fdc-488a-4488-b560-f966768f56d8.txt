Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find (y, y), which I think is the inner product of y with itself. The vector y is given as a column vector with three components. Let me make sure I understand what each part means.

First, the vector y is:
y = [ -1 + i, 2, 3 - i ]^T. So the components are complex numbers. To find the inner product, I remember that the inner product of a vector with itself is the sum of the squares of the magnitudes of each component. Alternatively, it's the sum of each component multiplied by its complex conjugate.

Wait, right, because for complex numbers, when you take the inner product, you have to take the complex conjugate of one of the vectors. Since (y, y) is the same as the conjugate transpose of y multiplied by y, each component will be multiplied by its conjugate.

So let me break it down step by step.

The first component of y is (-1 + i). Its complex conjugate is (-1 - i). So when I multiply them: (-1 + i)(-1 - i). Let's compute that.

Multiplying (-1 + i)(-1 - i):
= (-1)(-1) + (-1)(-i) + (i)(-1) + (i)(-i)
= 1 + i - i - i²
Wait, i squared is -1, so:
= 1 + 0 (since i -i is 0) - (-1) 
= 1 +1 = 2.

Okay, so the first term is 2.

The second component is 2, which is a real number. Its complex conjugate is itself. So 2 * 2 =4.

The third component is (3 - i). Conjugate is (3 + i). Multiply them: (3 -i)(3 +i) = 3² - (i)² =9 - (-1) =10.

Wait, wait, let me compute it manually to be sure:
(3 -i)(3 +i) = 3*3 +3*i -i*3 -i*i
=9 +3i -3i -i²
The 3i and -3i cancel out, leaving 9 - (-1) =10. Yep, that's correct.

So adding all the terms together: 2 +4 +10 =16.

Wait, but looking at the options, option J is 16. So that should be the answer.

Wait, did I do that right? Let me double-check each term.

First term again: (-1 +i) times (-1 -i). Using (a + b)(a -b) formula, which is a² - b². But wait, no, because a is (-1) and b is i. So [(-1)^2] - (i)^2 =1 - (-1)=2. Correct.

Second term: 2 *2=4. Correct.

Third term: (3)^2 - (i)^2=9-(-1)=10. Correct.

So sum is 2+4=6, 6+10=16. So answer is J, 16.

To find $(\mathbf{y}, \mathbf{y})$, we compute the inner product of the vector $\mathbf{y}$ with itself. The vector $\mathbf{y}$ is given as:

\[
\mathbf{y} = \begin{pmatrix} -1 + i \\ 2 \\ 3 - i \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The inner product $(\mathbf{y}, \mathbf{y})$ is calculated as the sum of the squared magnitudes of the components of $\mathbf{y}$. For complex numbers, this involves multiplying each component by its complex conjugate.

1. **First component**: $(-1 + i)(-1 - i)$  
   Using the formula $(a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2$, where $a = -1$ and $b = i$:  
   \[
   (-1)^2 - (i)^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2.
   \]

2. **Second component**: $2 \cdot 2 = 4.$  

3. **Third component**: $(3 - i)(3 + i)$  
   Again, using $(a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2$, where $a = 3$ and $b = i$:  
   \[
   3^2 - (i)^2 = 9 - (-1) = 10.
   \]

Adding these results together:  
\[
2 + 4 + 10 = 16.
\]

Thus, the value of $(\mathbf{y}, \mathbf{y})$ is 16. From the given options, the correct answer is:

J: 16.
