Okay, so I have this question about when the United States last won an Olympic gold medal in men's ice hockey. Hmm, I'm not super sure about the exact year, but I think I remember some key moments in Olympic hockey history. Let me try to piece this together.

I know that the US has had some significant victories. The most famous one I can think of is the "Miracle on Ice" during the Cold War. That was when the US team, which was mostly amateur and collegiate players, beat the heavily favored Soviet Union team. I believe that was in 1980. Oh wait, the question is asking for the last time they won gold, so that might not be the most recent.

Wait, but after that, I'm not sure if the US men's team has won gold again. I think the Soviet Union dominated for a while, and then other teams like Canada, Sweden, Finland, etc., have been strong competitors.

Let me think about more recent Olympics. In the 2000s, I remember the women's US hockey team winning gold, but not sure about the men. Oh, but wait, the men's team might have had some medals. For instance, I think in the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, the US men's team won silver, losing to Canada in the final. But that's silver, not gold.

What about after that? In 2006, I think the US didn't do as well. In 2010, they had a good run but again, I think they lost to Canada in the final, getting silver. Then in 2014, they didn't win gold either. So, maybe the US hasn't won gold since 1980?

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because I thought the US won gold more recently. Or was that in another event? Oh, no, I think I'm mixing up the women's and men's teams. The women's team has won gold multiple times, but the men's team hasn't since 1980.

So, looking at the options, the years given are A: 2000, B:2004, C:2008, D:1992, E:2012, F:1996, G:1976, H:1984, I:1988, J:1980.

Wait, I think J is 1980, which matches what I thought about the Miracle on Ice. But I'm trying to remember if the US men's team has won gold since then. I don't recall any gold medals for them in the 90s or 2000s. They've had some silver and bronze medals, but not gold.

So putting it all together, the last time the US men's hockey team won gold was in 1980, which would be option J.

The United States men's ice hockey team last won an Olympic gold medal in 1980, during the "Miracle on Ice." Since then, they have not secured another gold medal, with their most recent successes being silver medals in 2002 and 2010. Therefore, the correct answer is:

J: 1980

Answer: J
