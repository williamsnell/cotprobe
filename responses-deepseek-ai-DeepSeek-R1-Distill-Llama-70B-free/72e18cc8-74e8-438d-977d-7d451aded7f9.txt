Question:

One afternoon a motorist was driving her car when she struck a pedestrian who entered the intersection. The pedestrian was seriously injured in the accident and sued the motorist to recover damages for personal injuries. There were no witnesses to the accident. The motorist claims that the traffic light was green at the time she entered the intersection. The pedestrian now has amnesia and cannot remember how the accident occurred. At trial, the pedestrian's attorney calls a witness to testify. The witness proposes to testify that she was in the emergency room at the hospital when the pedestrian was brought in following the accident. The witness further testifies that while the pedestrian was being treated for his injuries, the nurse asked him, "How did you get hurt?" The pedestrian replied, "The car ran the red light and struck me as I was walking through the intersection. "Upon objection, this evidence is

Options:

A: admissible as a present sense impression.
B: inadmissible, because it is hearsay not within any recognized exception.
C: inadmissible, because the witness was eavesdropping on a confidential communication between the pedestrian and a hospital representative.
D: admissible, as it is a declaration against interest.
E: inadmissible, because it is a statement made after the event.
F: inadmissible, because the pedestrian's response was prompted by the nurse's question.
G: inadmissible, because the pedestrian cannot remember the incident.
H: admissible, as it is a statement of past or present mental, emotional, or physical condition.
I: admissible as a statement under stress or excitement.

Okay, so I've got this evidence question here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is about.

The scenario is a car accident where a motorist hit a pedestrian. The pedestrian is suing for damages. There were no witnesses, so that's a bit tricky. The motorist says the light was green when she entered the intersection. But the pedestrian has amnesia and can't remember what happened. Now, in court, the pedestrian's attorney calls a witness who was in the emergency room when the pedestrian was brought in. This witness testifies that while the pedestrian was being treated, a nurse asked him how he got hurt. The pedestrian replied, "The car ran the red light and struck me as I was walking through the intersection." 

The question is about whether this testimony is admissible or not, and the options are A through I. 

So I think the issue here is hearsay. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, right? And hearsay is generally inadmissible unless there's an exception.

The pedestrian's statement is being offered to show that the car ran the red light, which would make the motorist at fault. But since the pedestrian can't remember, he can't testify himself, so they're using this statement he made in the ER.

The options mention various exceptions. Let's go through them. 

Option A says it's admissible as a present sense impression. Present sense impression is when a statement describes an event made while the declarant is perceiving it or immediately thereafter. But here, the statement was made in the hospital after the accident. How much time passed? The question doesn't specify, but being in the ER would probably be a bit after the accident, so maybe not immediate enough. I'm not sure if it fits present sense impression.

Option B says it's inadmissible because it's hearsay not within any exception. If none of the exceptions apply, this would be the case. But I think some exception might apply.

Option C is about confidential communications. But the conversation was in the ER, and the witness overheard it. Unless it's a privileged communication, but I don't think that applies here. The nurse is asking, and the witness is just present. So maybe C isn't the right reason.

Option D is declaration against interest. That applies when the statement is against the declarant's interest at the time it was made. Here, the pedestrian is saying the car ran a red light. But that's not against his interest; it's actually in his interest to say that because he's suing the motorist. So D doesn't apply.

Option E says it's inadmissible because it's made after the event. But all hearsay exceptions allow statements made after the event, as long as they fit an exception. So E doesn't seem right.

Option F says it's inadmissible because the pedestrian's response was prompted by the nurse's question. I'm not sure if that matters. The issue is whether it's hearsay and if an exception applies, not whether it was prompted.

Option G says it's inadmissible because the pedestrian can't remember. But the statement was made when he could remember, right after the accident, before the amnesia. So his current inability to remember doesn't affect the admissibility of the prior statement.

Option H says it's admissible as a statement of past or present mental, emotional, or physical condition. That's under FRE 803(3). For this exception, the statement must be about the declarant's then state of mind. Here, the pedestrian is explaining how he got hurt, which is more about the event than his current feelings or thoughts. So maybe H isn't the right fit.

Option I says it's admissible as a statement under stress or excitement. That's the excited utterance exception under FRE 803(2). An excited utterance is a statement made in the heat of the moment, under the stress of a startling event. So if the pedestrian was in the ER being treated, perhaps he was still under the stress of the accident when he made the statement. That could qualify as an excited utterance.

Wait, but how much time had passed? If it was right after the accident, maybe he was still excited. But if it was a while later, maybe not. The question doesn't specify the time, but being in the ER suggests it's shortly after arrival, which is probably soon after the accident. So it might fit.

Alternatively, present sense impression (A) requires the statement to be made while perceiving the event or immediately after. If he was in the ER, perhaps the time had passed, but maybe it was still close enough.

I'm trying to remember the differences between excited utterance and present sense impression. Excited utterance is about the stress of the event, while present sense is about the timing relative to the event.

Another thought: the statement here is about the cause of the injury, which is the event itself. So excited utterance might apply because the pedestrian was under the stress of the accident when he made the statement.

Alternatively, maybe the statement is admissible under the medical diagnosis exception. But that exception usually applies to statements made for medical diagnosis or treatment. The pedestrian's statement here is explaining how he got hurt, which is relevant to treatment. So under FRE 803(4), statements made for medical diagnosis are admissible.

Wait, but I think the medical diagnosis exception covers statements made to medical personnel for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment. Here, the pedestrian was being treated, and the nurse asked him how he got hurt. So his statement was in response to that, which would be for medical purposes. So that would make it admissible under 803(4). 

But let's look back at the options. None of the options mention the medical diagnosis exception. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options, the one about present sense impression (A), excited utterance (I), and others. So if the correct exception is medical diagnosis, but that's not an option, then perhaps that's not the intended answer.

Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the exceptions. Let me think again. The medical diagnosis exception (FRE 803(4)) allows statements made for the purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment. Here, the pedestrian was being treated, and the nurse's question was part of that treatment. So his statement would be admissible under that exception.

But looking at the options, I don't see an option that matches that. So perhaps the intended answer is either excited utterance or present sense impression.

Alternatively, maybe the statement is not hearsay. But no, it's an out-of-court statement offered for the truth, so it's hearsay.

Wait, another thought: the statement is being offered by the pedestrian's attorney. The pedestrian is the plaintiff, so his statement would generally be admissible under a hearsay exception if it fits any. 

If it's an excited utterance, then it's admissible under 803(2). So option I says it's admissible as a statement under stress or excitement. That would fit.

Alternatively, the medical diagnosis exception would make it admissible, but if that's not an option, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, looking again, option I is present as an option, so that's possible.

Alternatively, maybe the statement is admissible as a present sense impression. That's option A. But I think excited utterance is more applicable here because the statement was made under stress.

So putting it all together, the correct answer would be I: admissible as a statement under stress or excitement.

Wait, but another possibility is that the statement is barred because the pedestrian can't remember, but I don't think that affects the admissibility. The statement was made when he could remember, so it's still admissible.

So I think the correct answer is I.

The question revolves around the admissibility of a statement made by the pedestrian in the emergency room after a car accident. The pedestrian's statement, "The car ran the red light and struck me as I was walking through the intersection," is being offered by the pedestrian's attorney to prove the motorist's fault. The issue is whether this statement qualifies under a hearsay exception.

### Key Analysis of the Options:

1. **Option A (Present Sense Impression)**: This exception applies when a statement describes an event made while the declarant is perceiving it or immediately thereafter. However, the statement was made in the ER, which likely occurred after the immediate perception of the event. Thus, this option is less applicable.

2. **Option B (Inadmissible Hearsay)**: This would apply if no hearsay exception fits. However, several exceptions could potentially apply, so this option is unlikely.

3. **Option C (Confidential Communication)**: This is inapplicable because there is no indication that the conversation in the ER was confidential or privileged.

4. **Option D (Declaration Against Interest)**: This exception applies when the statement is against the declarant's interest at the time it was made. Here, the pedestrian's statement is in his interest (supporting his lawsuit), so this exception does not apply.

5. **Option E (Statement Made After the Event)**: Hearsay exceptions often apply to statements made after the event, as long as they meet specific criteria. This option does not provide a valid basis for exclusion.

6. **Option F (Prompted by a Question)**: The fact that the pedestrian's statement was prompted by the nurse's question does not determine its admissibility. The focus is on whether it fits a hearsay exception.

7. **Option G (Pedestrian's Amnesia)**: The pedestrian's current inability to remember the incident does not affect the admissibility of the statement, as it was made when he could remember.

8. **Option H (Statement of Mental, Emotional, or Physical Condition)**: This exception under FRE 803(3) applies to statements about the declarant's state of mind. Here, the pedestrian's statement explains the cause of his injuries, not his mental or emotional state, so this exception does not apply.

9. **Option I (Statement Under Stress or Excitement)**: This exception under FRE 803(2) applies to statements made under the stress of a startling event. The pedestrian, likely still under the stress of the accident, made the statement in the ER. This makes it admissible as an excited utterance.

### Conclusion:
The pedestrian's statement is admissible as a statement made under stress or excitement, fitting the excited utterance exception. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**I: admissible as a statement under stress or excitement.**
