Okay, so I have this problem where I'm mixing ice and water, and I need to find the final temperature when they reach equilibrium. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

Alright, the setup is: 40 grams of ice at 0°C and 100 grams of water at 60°C. The ice will probably melt, right? Because the water is warmer than the ice. So the heat from the water will melt the ice, and then both will reach some equilibrium temperature.

Wait, but wait. I remember that when ice melts, it absorbs heat without changing temperature until all the ice is melted. Then, any remaining heat will raise the temperature of the resulting water. But I'm not sure if all the ice will melt here. Maybe only some of it melts, and the final temperature stays at 0°C. Or maybe all the ice melts, and the final temp is higher.

So first, I should calculate how much heat is required to melt the ice. The heat of fusion is given as 80 cal/g. So for 40g of ice, the heat needed is 40g * 80 cal/g = 3200 cal.

Then, I need to find out how much heat the water can give off when cooling down. The water is at 60°C, and when it cools, it loses heat. The specific heat is 1 cal/g°C, so the formula is mass * specific heat * change in temperature (ΔT).

But wait, the water could cool down to 0°C, which would be a ΔT of 60°C. Let me calculate that. The heat released by the water would be 100g * 1 cal/g°C * 60°C = 6000 cal. Oh, that's more than the 3200 cal needed to melt the ice. So all the ice can melt, and there's still some heat left over.

So after melting the ice, the remaining heat from the water (6000 - 3200 = 2800 cal) will be used to raise the temperature of the melted ice (now water) and the original water.

Wait, no, no. Because the ice is at 0°C, the melted water is also at 0°C. The original water was at 60°C, but after giving up some heat, its temperature drops. So the system will reach a final temperature somewhere above 0°C.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this more systematically.

First, calculate the heat required to melt all the ice: Q1 = m_ice * L = 40g * 80 cal/g = 3200 cal.

Next, calculate how much heat the water can provide when cooling to 0°C: Q2 = m_water * c * (T_initial - T_final) = 100g * 1 cal/g°C * (60°C - 0°C) = 6000 cal.

Since Q2 (6000) is more than Q1 (3200), all the ice melts, and there's remaining heat: 6000 - 3200 = 2800 cal. This remaining heat will raise the temperature of the entire mass of water (ice melted plus original water) from 0°C to some final temp T.

The total mass of water after melting is 40g + 100g = 140g.

So the heat used to raise the temperature is Q3 = m_total * c * (T - 0) = 140g * 1 * T = 140T cal.

This Q3 must be equal to the remaining heat, 2800 cal.

So 140T = 2800 → T = 2800 / 140 = 20°C.

So the final temperature should be 20°C, which is option C.

Wait, but let me double-check. Because when the ice melts, the 40g becomes water at 0°C, and the 100g of water was originally at 60°C.

After melting, the 100g cools down, and the 40g warms up.

But the way I calculated, the remaining heat after melting (2800 cal) is used to heat 140g from 0 to 20°C. That seems correct.

Alternatively, I could model it using heat lost equals heat gained.

Heat lost by the original water: m_water * c * (T_initial - T_final) → 100 * 1 * (60 - T).

Heat gained by ice: melting (m_ice * L) + heating the melted water (m_ice * c * (T - 0)).

So equation:

Heat lost = heat gained.

100*(60 - T) = 40*80 + 40*(T -0).

Let me calculate that.

Left side: 100*(60-T) = 6000 - 100T.

Right side: 40*80 = 3200 + 40T.

So equation:

6000 - 100T = 3200 + 40T.

Bring variables to one side: 6000 - 3200 = 100T +40T → 2800 = 140T → T=20°C.

Same result.

So the answer is C: 20°C.

To determine the final temperature after equilibrium is established, we analyze the heat exchange between the ice and the water. The system involves 40 g of ice at 0°C and 100 g of water at 60°C. The heat of fusion of ice is 80 cal/g, and the specific heat capacity of water is 1 cal/g°C.

1. **Heat required to melt the ice**:  
   The heat required to melt 40 g of ice is:  
   \[
   Q_1 = m_{\text{ice}} \cdot L = 40 \, \text{g} \cdot 80 \, \text{cal/g} = 3200 \, \text{cal}.
   \]

2. **Heat released by the water as it cools to 0°C**:  
   The water cools from 60°C to 0°C, releasing heat:  
   \[
   Q_2 = m_{\text{water}} \cdot c \cdot \Delta T = 100 \, \text{g} \cdot 1 \, \text{cal/g°C} \cdot (60°C - 0°C) = 6000 \, \text{cal}.
   \]

   Since \( Q_2 > Q_1 \), all the ice melts, and there is remaining heat:  
   \[
   Q_{\text{remaining}} = Q_2 - Q_1 = 6000 \, \text{cal} - 3200 \, \text{cal} = 2800 \, \text{cal}.
   \]

3. **Heating the resulting water**:  
   After the ice melts, the system consists of 140 g of water (40 g from melted ice + 100 g of original water). The remaining heat (\( Q_{\text{remaining}} = 2800 \, \text{cal} \)) is used to raise the temperature of this water from 0°C to the final temperature \( T \):  
   \[
   Q_3 = m_{\text{total}} \cdot c \cdot T = 140 \, \text{g} \cdot 1 \, \text{cal/g°C} \cdot T = 140T \, \text{cal}.
   \]

   Equating \( Q_3 \) to \( Q_{\text{remaining}} \):  
   \[
   140T = 2800 \implies T = \frac{2800}{140} = 20°C.
   \]

Thus, the final temperature of the system after equilibrium is established is **20°C**.
