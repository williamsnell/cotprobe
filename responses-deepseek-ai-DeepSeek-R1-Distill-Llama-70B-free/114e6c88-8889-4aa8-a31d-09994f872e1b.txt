Okay, so I have this problem here that I'm trying to solve. The question is about finding when a vertical tangent line occurs for a given curve. The equation is x³ + xy - y² = 10. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that a vertical tangent line occurs where the slope of the tangent is undefined, which happens when the derivative dy/dx is infinite. Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of implicit differentiation because the equation isn't solved for y.

Let me start by differentiating both sides with respect to x. So, the original equation is x³ + xy - y² = 10. Taking the derivative of each term:

The derivative of x³ is 3x². Then for the xy term, I'll use the product rule. The product rule says d/dx (xy) = x dy/dx + y. Next, the derivative of -y² is -2y dy/dx. And the derivative of 10 is 0.

So putting it all together:

3x² + x dy/dx + y - 2y dy/dx = 0.

Now, I need to solve for dy/dx. Let's collect the terms with dy/dx:

dy/dx (x - 2y) + 3x² + y = 0.

So, moving the other terms to the other side:

dy/dx (x - 2y) = -3x² - y.

Then, dy/dx = (-3x² - y)/(x - 2y).

But wait, for a vertical tangent, dy/dx is undefined. That would mean the denominator is zero, right? So the denominator (x - 2y) must be zero, but the numerator shouldn't be zero at the same time because that would make it indeterminate. So, set the denominator equal to zero:

x - 2y = 0 → x = 2y.

So, now I can substitute x = 2y back into the original equation to find the possible points where the tangent is vertical.

Substitute x = 2y into x³ + xy - y² = 10.

So, (2y)^3 + (2y)(y) - y² = 10.

Calculating each term:

(2y)^3 is 8y³.

(2y)(y) is 2y².

So the equation becomes:

8y³ + 2y² - y² = 10 → 8y³ + y² =10.

Simplify that:

8y³ + y² -10 = 0.

Hmm, now I have a cubic equation in y. I'm not sure how to solve this easily. Maybe I can try to find real roots numerically. Let's see.

Let me try plugging in some values for y to see if I can get close to zero.

Let's try y=1: 8(1) +1 -10 → 8+1-10= -1. So f(1)=-1.

y=1.2: 8*(1.728) + (1.44) -10 → let's compute that.

1.2^3 is 1.728, times 8 is 13.824. 1.2² is 1.44. So 13.824 +1.44 =15.264 → 15.264-10=5.264. So f(1.2)=5.264.

Wait, but wait, wait, the equation is 8y³ + y² =10, so at y=1, it's 8+1=9, which is less than 10, so 9 <10 → f(1)= -1.

At y=1.2, 8*(1.728) =13.824, plus 1.44 → 15.264. 15.264-10=5.264, so positive.

So between y=1 and y=1.2, the function crosses zero.

I can do a linear approximation or use the Newton-Raphson method.

Let me try the Newton-Raphson method. Let me denote f(y)=8y³ + y² -10.

We know that f(1)= -1, f(1.2)=5.264.

I can pick y0=1.1 as a starting point.

f(1.1) = 8*(1.331) + 1.21 -10 → 10.648 +1.21=11.858 → 11.858-10=1.858.

So f(1.1)=1.858.

Wait, wait, wait: 1.1^3 is 1.331. 8*1.331 is 10.648. 1.1² is 1.21. So 10.648 +1.21=11.858. Subtract 10 → 1.858.

So f(1.1)=1.858, which is positive. So between 1 and 1.1, the function goes from -1 to +1.858. Wait no, wait, at y=1, f(y)= -1, at y=1.1, f(y)=+1.858, so the root is between 1 and 1.1.

Wait, but earlier I thought y=1 gives f(y)= -1, y=1.2 gives f=5.264. So to get a better approximation, let's compute f(1.05):

1.05^3 = 1.157625. 8*1.157625≈9.261. 1.05²=1.1025. So 9.261 +1.1025=10.3635. 10.3635-10=0.3635. So f(1.05)=0.3635.

Now, f(1)= -1, f(1.05)=0.3635. So the root is between 1 and 1.05.

Let me take y1=1.0: f= -1.

y2=1.05 → f=0.3635.

The change in y is 0.05, and the change in f is 1.3635 (from -1 to +0.3635, which is a total change of 1.3635 over 0.05 in y).

We can estimate where f=0. Let me compute the fraction between y=1 and 1.05 where f=0.

Let me let y =1 + t*(0.05), where t is between 0 and 1.

At t, f(y)= -1 + t*(1.3635) =0.

So:

-1 +1.3635 t =0 → t=1/1.3635 ≈0.7333.

So the root is approximately at y=1 + 0.7333*(0.05)=1 + 0.036666≈1.036666.

So y ≈1.0367.

Then x=2y → x≈2.0733.

Looking at the options, option A is 2.074, D is 2.096, E is -2.074, F is -2.096.

So the closest match is option A: 2.074.

Wait, but wait, let me check my calculations again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Wait, when I computed f(1.05), I think I might have a mistake. Let me recalculate.

f(y) =8y³ + y² -10.

At y=1.05:

y^3 = (1.05)^3 = 1.157625.

8 * 1.157625 =9.261.

y²=1.1025.

So 9.261 +1.1025=10.3635.

10.3635-10=0.3635, so f=0.3635. That's correct.

Now, using Newton-Raphson:

We can take y0=1.05, f(y0)=0.3635.

Compute the derivative f’(y) =24y² +2y.

At y=1.05: f’=24*(1.1025) + 2*(1.05)= 24*1.1025=26.46, 2*1.05=2.1 → total 28.56.

The Newton-Raphson update is y1 = y0 -f(y0)/f’(y0).

So y1=1.05 - (0.3635)/(28.56).

0.3635/28.56 ≈0.0127.

So y1=1.05 -0.0127=1.0373.

Compute f(1.0373):

y=1.0373.

y^3 = (1.0373)^3. Let me compute 1.0373^3:

Approximate, perhaps using (1 + a)^3=1 +3a +3a² +a^3.

a=0.0373. So:

1.0373^3 ≈1 + 3*(0.0373) + 3*(0.0373)^2 + (0.0373)^3.

3*(0.0373)=0.1119.

3*(0.0373)^2=3*(0.001391)=0.004173.

(0.0373)^3≈0.000052.

Sum: 1 +0.1119=1.1119 +0.004173=1.116073 +0.000052=1.116125.

So y^3≈1.1161.

Then 8y³≈8*1.1161≈8.9288.

y²= (1.0373)^2= approx 1.0758.

So f(y)=8y³ + y² -10 →8.9288 +1.0758 -10 → (8.9288+1.0758)=9.0046 → 9.0046-10= -0.9954. Wait, that can't be right because earlier at y=1.0373, which is just a bit below 1.05, f(y) was positive. Did I miscalculate?

Wait, perhaps I should calculate more accurately.

Wait, y=1.0373.

Compute y^3:

1.0373 *1.0373 = (using calculator steps)

Let me compute 1.0373 *1.0373.

1.0373 *1.0373:

1 *1.0373 =1.0373.

0.0373*1.0373.

Wait, perhaps I should compute 1.0373^2.

= (1 + 0.0373)^2 =1 + 2*(0.0373) + (0.0373)^2 =1 + 0.0746 + 0.001391=1.075991.

Then, y^3= y^2 * y =1.075991 *1.0373.

Compute 1.075991 *1.0373.

Let me compute 1.075991 *1.0373:

First, 1 *1.0373=1.0373.

0.075991 *1.0373: Let's compute 0.07 *1.0373=0.072711.

0.005991 *1.0373≈0.006227.

So total: 0.072711 +0.006227=0.078938.

So y^3=1.0373 +0.078938=1.116238.

So 8y^3≈8 *1.116238≈8.9299.

y²=1.075991.

So f(y)=8.9299 +1.075991=9.00589.

9.00589-10= -0.99411.

Wait, but earlier at y=1.05, f(y)=0.3635. So how come at y=1.0373, f(y) is negative? That suggests that perhaps my earlier assumption that the root is between 1 and 1.05 is correct, but the function crosses zero there.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, wait, at y=1, f(y)=8*(1)^3 +1^2 -10=8+1-10= -1.

At y=1.0373, f(y)=8*(1.116238) + (1.0373)^2 -10.

Wait, 8*(1.116238)=8.929904.

(1.0373)^2=1.075991.

Adding them: 8.929904 +1.075991=10.005895.

10.005895 -10=0.005895. So f(y)=0.005895.

Wait, that's positive. So that's very close to zero.

So, using the Newton-Raphson method, with y0=1.0373, f(y0)=0.005895.

Compute f'(y0)=24y0² + 2y0.

y0=1.0373.

y0²=1.075991.

24*1.075991=25.92349.

2y0=2.0746.

So f’(y0)=25.92349 + 2.0746=27.99809≈28.

So the next iteration is y1= y0 - f(y0)/f’(y0)=1.0373 - (0.005895)/28 ≈1.0373 - 0.0002105=1.0370895.

Compute f(y1)=8y1³ + y1² -10.

Compute y1=1.0370895.

y1^2 = (1.0370895)^2 = let's compute:

1.0370895 *1.0370895.

We can compute this as (1 + 0.0370895)^2=1 + 2*(0.0370895) + (0.0370895)^2.

2*(0.0370895)=0.074179.

(0.0370895)^2≈0.001376.

So y1²≈1 +0.074179 +0.001376=1.075555.

y1^3= y1^2 * y1=1.075555 *1.0370895.

Compute 1.075555 *1.0370895 ≈.

Let me compute 1 *1.0370895=1.0370895.

0.075555 *1.0370895≈0.075555 *1=0.075555, 0.075555*0.0370895≈0.002805.

So total ≈0.075555 +0.002805=0.07836.

So y1^3≈1.0370895 +0.07836≈1.11545.

So 8y1^3≈8*1.11545≈8.9236.

Then, 8y1³ + y1² ≈8.9236 +1.075555=9.999155.

Subtract 10: 9.999155-10≈-0.000845.

So f(y1)= -0.000845.

Wait, so now we have y1=1.0370895, f(y1)=~ -0.000845.

So now, f(y1) is negative, whereas at y=1.0373, f(y) was positive. So the root is somewhere between y=1.0370895 and y=1.0373.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should instead use linear approximation between y=1.0370895 (f=-0.000845) and y=1.0373 (f=0.005895).

The difference in y is 1.0373 -1.0370895=0.0002105.

The difference in f is 0.005895 - (-0.000845)=0.00674.

We want to find the y where f=0, starting from y=1.0370895.

So the fraction is 0.000845 / 0.00674 ≈0.000845 /0.00674≈0.1254.

So y ≈1.0370895 + 0.1254*(0.0002105) ≈1.0370895 + 0.0000264≈1.0371159.

So y≈1.037116.

So x=2y≈2.07423, which is approximately 2.074.

Looking back at the options, option A is 2.074, which matches this value.

So the correct answer should be option A.
</think>

To determine when the curve \( x^3 + xy - y^2 = 10 \) has a vertical tangent line, we start by finding the derivative \( \frac{dy}{dx} \) using implicit differentiation. Differentiating both sides with respect to \( x \), we get:

\[
3x^2 + x \frac{dy}{dx} + y - 2y \frac{dy}{dx} = 0.
\]

Rearranging to solve for \( \frac{dy}{dx} \), we find:

\[
\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{-3x^2 - y}{x - 2y}.
\]

A vertical tangent occurs when \( \frac{dy}{dx} \) is undefined, which happens when the denominator \( x - 2y = 0 \). This implies \( x = 2y \). Substituting \( x = 2y \) into the original equation \( x^3 + xy - y^2 = 10 \), we get:

\[
(2y)^3 + (2y)(y) - y^2 = 10.
\]

Simplifying:

\[
8y^3 + 2y^2 - y^2 = 10 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 8y^3 + y^2 - 10 = 0.
\]

This is a cubic equation in \( y \). To solve it numerically, we test values of \( y \) and refine our approximation. For example:

- At \( y = 1 \), \( f(y) = 8(1)^3 + (1)^2 - 10 = -1 \).
- At \( y = 1.2 \), \( f(y) = 8(1.2)^3 + (1.2)^2 - 10 = 5.264 \).

The root lies between \( y = 1 \) and \( y = 1.2 \). Using the Newton-Raphson method, we refine the approximation:

1. Starting with \( y_0 = 1.05 \), we compute \( f(y_0) = 8(1.05)^3 +
