Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here about calculating the weight of sulfuric acid in a solution. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step.

Alright, the question says: Calculate the weight in grams of sulfuric acid in 2.00 liters of a 0.100 molar solution. The molecular weight (MW) of H₂SO₄ is given as 98.1. And there are multiple-choice options to choose from.

Wait, I remember that molarity is moles per liter. So molarity (M) is moles of solute divided by liters of solution. The formula is M = moles/L. So if I have the molarity and the volume, I can find the moles, right?

Right, so the solution is 0.100 M and the volume is 2.00 liters. Let me calculate the moles first. Moles = Molarity × Volume. So that's 0.100 moles/liter × 2.00 liters. Let me do that math: 0.1 * 2 = 0.2 moles of H₂SO₄.

Wait, wait. Oh, right, sulfuric acid is H₂SO₄, so each mole is one mole of the acid. So 0.2 moles in total. Now, to find the mass, I need to multiply the moles by the molar mass. Molar mass is given as 98.1 g/mol. So mass = moles × molar mass.

Calculating that: 0.2 moles × 98.1 g/mol. Let me do the multiplication. Hmm, 0.2 times 98 is 19.6, and 0.2 times 0.1 is 0.02, so adding them gives 19.62 grams. Wait, but wait, the options don't have 19.62 exactly. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options: Option E is 19.6 g. That's very close to my calculation. So that must be the right answer.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Moles: 0.1 M * 2 L = 0.2 moles. Mass is 0.2 * 98.1 = 19.62 g. Oh, but 98.1 is precise to three significant figures, and the volume and molarity are given to three and three sig figs as well. So 19.62 would round to 19.6 grams, which matches option E.

So I think the correct answer is E.

To calculate the weight of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) in 2.00 liters of a 0.100 molar solution, we start by determining the number of moles of H₂SO₄. Molarity (M) is defined as moles of solute per liter of solution, so:

\[
\text{Moles of H₂SO₄} = \text{Molarity} \times \text{Volume} = 0.100 \, \text{mol/L} \times 2.00 \, \text{L} = 0.200 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Next, we calculate the mass of H₂SO₄ using its molar mass (98.1 g/mol):

\[
\text{Mass of H₂SO₄} = \text{Moles} \times \text{Molar Mass} = 0.200 \, \text{mol} \times 98.1 \, \text{g/mol} = 19.62 \, \text{g}.
\]

Rounding to three significant figures (consistent with the given data), the mass is 19.6 g. Comparing this result to the provided options, the correct answer is:

**E: 19.6 g**

Answer: E
