Question:

A group of scientists wanted to estimate the proportion of geese returning to the same site for the next breeding season. Suppose they decided to increase the sample size from 200 to 2,000. How will this affect the distribution of the sample proportion?

Options:

A: The shape of the distribution of the sample proportion will change significantly.
B: There will be no noticeable change in the distribution of the sample proportion.
C: The distribution of the sample proportion will become more uniform.
D: The distribution of the sample proportion will become skewed.
E: The distribution of the sample proportion will be more spread out.
F: The distribution of the sample proportion will more closely resemble the binomial distribution.
G: The distribution of the sample proportion will be less spread out.
H: The spread of the distribution of the sample proportion will remain unaffected.

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this statistics question about sample proportions. Let's see what the question says. 

So, the question is about a group of scientists estimating the proportion of geese returning to the same breeding site. They increased their sample size from 200 to 2000, and we need to determine how this affects the distribution of the sample proportion.

Hmm, I remember that when dealing with sample proportions, the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) comes into play. The CLT says that as the sample size increases, the distribution of the sample proportion becomes more normal, regardless of the population distribution. But wait, the question isn't directly about the shape becoming more normal, though that's part of it.

The options given are A through H. Let me think about each.

Option A says the shape changes significantly. Well, increasing the sample size does make the distribution approach normal, so if the original sample size was 200, which is already a decent size, moving to 2000 might make it even more normal. But 200 is probably already leading to a roughly normal distribution. So maybe the change in shape isn't that big, making A less likely.

Option B: No noticeable change. That doesn't seem right because increasing sample size does affect the distribution, especially in terms of spread.

Option C: More uniform. I'm not sure. Uniform distribution is a flat one, but the sample proportion's distribution becomes more bell-shaped (normal), so C doesn't seem right.

Option D: More skewed. No, larger samples tend to reduce skewness as they approach normality. So D is probably incorrect.

Option E: More spread out. Wait, spread refers to variance. I think the variance of the sampling distribution decreases with larger n. Because the standard error is sqrt(p(1-p)/n), so as n increases, standard error decreases. So the spread becomes less. So E is wrong.

Option F: More like binomial. Well, the sample proportion is based on counts from a binomial distribution (successes and failures). But as n increases, and if p isn't too extreme, the binomial approximates a normal distribution. So the distribution of the sample proportion (which is a scaled binomial) becomes more normal. So F might not be correct because the distribution is moving away from binomial towards normal.

Option G: Less spread out. This aligns with what I thought earlier. Larger sample size reduces standard error, making the distribution tighter around the mean. So G seems correct.

Option H: Spread remains same. No, because as n increases, spread decreases. So H is wrong.

Wait, but what about the shape? The question is about the distribution's properties. The main effect of increasing n is that the distribution becomes more normal (so shape changes) and the spread (standard deviation) decreases.

Looking back at the options, the question is about how the distribution of the sample proportion is affected. So the shape becomes more normal (so maybe A is incorrect if the shape was already mostly normal with n=200), but the spread definitely decreases.

Looking at the options, G says the distribution becomes less spread out, which is correct. So the correct answer should be G.

Wait, but the original sample size was 200; would that already give a roughly normal distribution? For the CLT, n >30 is often a rule of thumb. So with n=200, it's already quite normal. So increasing to 2000 would make the distribution even more normal, but the main change is in the spread, not the shape.

So the question is, which option correctly captures that?

Looking at the options, the question is about the distribution's properties. The key here is understanding that as sample size increases, the standard error decreases, leading to a less spread out distribution. So the spread (variance) decreases, meaning the distribution is more concentrated around the true proportion.

So the correct answer should be G: The distribution will be less spread out.

When estimating the proportion of geese returning to the same breeding site, the scientists increased their sample size from 200 to 2,000. This change affects the distribution of the sample proportion in two key ways: 

1. **Shape**: The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that as the sample size increases, the distribution of the sample proportion becomes more normal, regardless of the population distribution. With a sample size of 200, the distribution is already approximately normal, so increasing the sample size to 2,000 will not significantly alter the shape of the distribution.

2. **Spread**: The spread of the distribution, measured by the standard error, decreases as the sample size increases. The standard error is given by \( \sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} \), where \( n \) is the sample size. As \( n \) increases, the standard error decreases, making the distribution less spread out and more concentrated around the true proportion.

Given these considerations, the correct answer is that the distribution of the sample proportion will be less spread out.

Answer: G
