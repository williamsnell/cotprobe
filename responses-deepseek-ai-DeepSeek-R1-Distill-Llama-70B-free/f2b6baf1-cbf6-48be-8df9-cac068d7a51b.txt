Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about critical legal theory, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me start by recalling what I know about critical legal studies.

From what I remember, critical legal theorists are skeptical about the notion that law is objective or neutral. They often argue that law isn't just about abstract principles but is influenced by social and economic factors. So, I think they would agree that law reflects economic power, which would make option C something they accept, not reject.

The question asks which proposition critical legal theorists would reject. So I need to find the statement that goes against their views.

Option B is "Law is determinate." Determinate means that the law has clear, fixed meanings, and each case can be decided in only one correct way. Critical legal theorists, I believe, argue against this. They say that the law is indeterminate, meaning that legal texts can be interpreted in multiple ways, and outcomes are not predetermined. So they would reject the idea that law is determinate. That makes option B a likely candidate.

Option D says "Law is politics." I think critical legal theorists do say that law is political, as it's shaped by power dynamics and political interests. So they wouldn't reject that; in fact, they might agree. So D is not the answer.

Option A is "Law is unstable." Since they argue that law isn't fixed and can be interpreted in various ways, they might agree that it's unstable. So A isn't the proposition they'd reject.

Option E, "Law is a social construct," aligns with their views because they see law as being shaped by society and power structures. So E is something they accept.

Putting it together, the proposition they would reject is B: Law is determinate. So the answer should be B.

The critical legal theorists reject the idea that the law is determinate because they argue that legal interpretations are not fixed and can vary based on social and political contexts.

Answer: B
