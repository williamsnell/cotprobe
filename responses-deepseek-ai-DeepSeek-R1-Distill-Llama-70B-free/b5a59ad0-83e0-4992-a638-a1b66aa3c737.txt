Okay, so I have this problem about cyclic groups, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it. The question is about finding the number of elements in the cyclic subgroup of Z_30 generated by 25. The options are given from A to J, and I need to choose the correct one.

First, I remember that Z_n refers to the integers modulo n under addition. So Z_30 would be the set {0, 1, 2, ..., 29} with addition modulo 30. A cyclic subgroup generated by an element g is like all the multiples of g modulo 30. So the subgroup generated by 25 would be {25, 25+25, 25+25+25, ...} mod 30.

Wait, so each element in the subgroup is like k*25 mod 30 for some integer k. But how many distinct elements are there before it starts repeating? That must be the order of 25 in Z_30. Oh right, the order of an element g in a group is the smallest positive integer m such that m*g ≡ 0 mod n.

So I need to find the smallest m where 25m ≡ 0 mod 30. Let me write that as 25m is a multiple of 30. To find m, I can think about the least common multiple or maybe use the formula involving the greatest common divisor (gcd).

I remember that the order of an element g in Z_n is n divided by the gcd of g and n. So the order here would be 30 / gcd(25,30). Let me compute the gcd of 25 and 30.

The factors of 25 are 1,5,25. The factors of 30 are 1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30. So the greatest common divisor is 5. Therefore, the order of 25 in Z_30 is 30/5 = 6. So the cyclic subgroup generated by 25 has 6 elements.

Looking at the options, option I is 6. So the answer should be I.

Wait, let me double-check. Let's list the elements. Starting with 25:

1*25 =25 mod30=25
2*25=50 mod30=20
3*25=75 mod30=75-2*30=15
4*25=100 mod30=100-3*30=10
5*25=125 mod30=125-4*30=5
6*25=150 mod30=0.

So the elements are 25,20,15,10,5,0. That's six elements. Yep, so the order is indeed 6. So the correct choice is I.

The cyclic subgroup of \( \mathbb{Z}_{30} \) generated by 25 consists of all multiples of 25 modulo 30. To determine the number of elements in this subgroup, we calculate the order of 25 in \( \mathbb{Z}_{30} \). The order of an element \( g \) in \( \mathbb{Z}_n \) is given by \( \frac{n}{\gcd(g, n)} \).

1. Compute \( \gcd(25, 30) \):  
   The divisors of 25 are \( \{1, 5, 25\} \), and the divisors of 30 are \( \{1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30\} \). The greatest common divisor is \( 5 \).

2. Calculate the order:  
   The order of 25 is \( \frac{30}{5} = 6 \).

3. Verify by listing the elements:  
   The elements of the subgroup are \( \{25, 20, 15, 10, 5, 0\} \), which confirms there are 6 distinct elements.

Thus, the number of elements in the cyclic subgroup is 6. The correct answer is:

I: 6
