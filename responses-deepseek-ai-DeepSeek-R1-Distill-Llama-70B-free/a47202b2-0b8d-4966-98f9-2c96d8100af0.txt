Okay, I'm trying to figure out this math problem. Hmm, let me read it again. So, the question is about finding the area of a square. The sides of the square are the same length as the radius of a circle. And the circle has a circumference of 12π units. Alright, so I need to connect the circumference of the circle to the radius, and then use that radius as the side of the square to find its area.

Wait, I remember that the circumference of a circle is given by the formula C = 2πr, where r is the radius. So if the circumference is 12π, I can set up the equation like this: 12π = 2πr. To find r, I should divide both sides by 2π. Let me do that.

12π divided by 2π is 6. So the radius of the circle is 6 units. That makes sense because the π cancels out, leaving 12/2 which is 6.

Now, the square has sides equal to this radius. So each side of the square is 6 units long. The area of a square is calculated by side length squared. So the area should be 6 squared, which is 36.

Let me double-check that. If the side is 6, then 6 times 6 is 36. Yeah, that sounds right. So the area of the square is 36 square units.

Looking at the options, option C is 36. So the correct answer should be C.

The problem requires finding the area of a square whose side length is equal to the radius of a circle with a circumference of \(12\pi\) units. 

1. **Calculate the radius of the circle**:  
   The circumference \(C\) of a circle is given by \(C = 2\pi r\). Setting \(C = 12\pi\), we solve for \(r\):  
   \[
   12\pi = 2\pi r \implies r = \frac{12\pi}{2\pi} = 6
   \]  
   Thus, the radius of the circle is 6 units.

2. **Determine the side length of the square**:  
   The side of the square is equal to the radius of the circle, so the side length of the square is also 6 units.

3. **Calculate the area of the square**:  
   The area \(A\) of a square is given by \(A = \text{side}^2\). Substituting the side length:  
   \[
   A = 6^2 = 36
   \]

Therefore, the area of the square is 36 square units. The correct answer is **C: 36**.
