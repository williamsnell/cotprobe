Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about peas. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my Punnett squares, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question is about finding the fraction of offspring that are homozygous recessive for all three gene pairs. The cross given is GgDdww × GgddWw. The traits are tall (D) dominant over dwarf (d), yellow (G) dominant over green (g), and round (W) dominant over wrinkled (w). 

Wait, wait. So each gene pair is independent, right? Because in peas, the traits are usually determined by genes on different chromosomes, so they assort independently. So I can calculate each gene's probability separately and then multiply them together.

Let me break it down gene by gene.

First gene pair: Gg × Gg. So each parent can produce which gametes? G and g, each with 50% chance. So for the Gg × Gg cross, the possible offspring are GG (25%), Gg (50%), and gg (25%). Oh wait, but wait, the question is about homozygous recessive. So for each gene, the homozygous recessive would be gg, dd, and ww.

Wait, wait, the parents are GgDdww and GgddWw. So let me check each gene:

1. G gene: Both parents are Gg. So when they mate, the possible genotypes for G are GG, Gg, or gg. So the chance of a child being gg is 25%.

2. D gene: The parents are Dd and dd. So one parent is Dd, which produces D and d gametes, each 50%. The other parent is dd, which can only give d. So the possible combinations are Dd (50%) and dd (50%). So the chance of being dd is 50%.

Wait, but wait the parents are GgDdww and GgddWw. So the D gene in the first parent is Dd, and the second parent is dd. So the cross for D is Dd × dd. So the gametes from Dd are D and d, each 50%, and from dd are d and d. So the possible offspring are Dd (50%) and dd (50%). So for the D gene, the chance of dd is 50%.

3. W gene: The parents are ww and Ww. So the first parent can only give w gametes. The second parent, Ww, can give W or w, each 50%. So possible offspring are Ww (50%) and ww (50%). So the chance of being ww is 50%.

Wait wait, no. Wait the first parent is ww. So they can only contribute w. The other parent is Ww, so they can give W or w. So the cross is ww (ww) × Ww (Ww). So the possible offspring for the W gene are wW (which is Ww) and ww. So each has 50% chance. Therefore, the chance of being ww (homozygous recessive) is 50%.

Wait, no. Because when you cross ww (homozygous recessive) with Ww (heterozygous), the offspring are 50% ww (homozygous recessive) and 50% Ww (heterozygous). So yes, 50% chance for ww.

But wait, the parents are ww and Ww. So the first parent gives w, the second gives either W or w. So the children would be either Ww or ww, each 50% chance. So the chance of ww is 50%.

So for each gene, the probability of the offspring being homozygous recessive is:

G gene: 25% (gg)
D gene: 50% (dd)
W gene: 50% (ww)

Since all three must be homozygous recessive, I need to multiply the probabilities.

So 0.25 (for G) × 0.5 (for D) × 0.5 (for W) = 0.25 × 0.25 = 0.0625.

Wait, 0.25 × 0.5 is 0.125, and then 0.125 × 0.5 is 0.0625. Oh wait, no, wait 0.25 * 0.5 = 0.125, then 0.125 * 0.5 is 0.0625. Which is 1/16.

Wait, but wait wait. Let me double-check the calculations.

G: both parents Gg. So for each, the chance of passing g is 50%. So the chance that both parents pass g is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25. So yes, 25% chance for gg.

D: parents are Dd and dd. So for D, as I said, the chance of being dd is 50%.

W: parents are ww and Ww. So chance of ww is 50%.

So the combined probability is 0.25 × 0.5 × 0.5 = 0.0625, which is 1/16.

Looking at the options, option E is 1/16.

To determine the fraction of offspring that are homozygous recessive in all gene pairs from the cross \( GgDdww \times GgddWw \), we analyze each gene pair independently and then combine the probabilities.

### Gene 1: \( G \) (Yellow/Green)
- Both parents are \( Gg \).
- The possible offspring genotypes are \( GG \) (25%), \( Gg \) (50%), and \( gg \) (25%).
- The probability of being homozygous recessive (\( gg \)) is \( \frac{1}{4} \).

### Gene 2: \( D \) (Tall/Dwarf)
- The parents are \( Dd \) and \( dd \).
- The possible offspring genotypes are \( Dd \) (50%) and \( dd \) (50%).
- The probability of being homozygous recessive (\( dd \)) is \( \frac{1}{2} \).

### Gene 3: \( W \) (Round/Wrinkled)
- The parents are \( ww \) and \( Ww \).
- The possible offspring genotypes are \( Ww \) (50%) and \( ww \) (50%).
- The probability of being homozygous recessive (\( ww \)) is \( \frac{1}{2} \).

### Combined Probability
Since the traits are independently inherited, the probability of being homozygous recessive for all three gene pairs is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{16}.
\]

Thus, the fraction of offspring that are homozygous recessive in all gene pairs is \( \frac{1}{16} \).
