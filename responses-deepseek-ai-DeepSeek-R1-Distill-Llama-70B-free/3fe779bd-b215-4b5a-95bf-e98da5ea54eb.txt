Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the Social Security Act of 1935 and the percentage of Americans who were in favor of it back then. The options are from A to J, each with different percentages. I need to figure out the correct answer.

First, I remember that the Social Security Act was a major part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. It was enacted to provide financial assistance to the elderly, the unemployed, and other vulnerable populations. But I'm not exactly sure about the public opinion at the time.

I think about historical context. The 1930s were the Great Depression era, so a lot of people were struggling. There would have been a lot of support for any program that offered relief. But I also recall that not everyone was on board. Some people thought it was too much government intervention, others worried about the costs and the constitutionality.

Wait, I remember reading somewhere that when Social Security was introduced, it had significant public support. Maybe around 60% or higher. But I'm not certain. I think the exact figure might be tricky without specific knowledge.

I also consider that the Social Security Act was quite popular because it addressed immediate needs. It provided old-age pensions, which were desperately needed. So, maybe the support was more than half, perhaps around 60-70%. But I'm not sure if it was as high as 80% or 90%.

Looking at the options, the choices are 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%. I'm trying to eliminate the extremes. 100% is impossible because there's always some opposition. 20%, 30%, 40%, 50% seem too low given the context. People were desperate, so support was probably higher.

Between 60%, 70%, 80%, and 90%. I think 60% is a commonly cited figure for support of such major legislation. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe it was higher because it was part of the New Deal which was broadly popular.

Wait, another thought: the initial Social Security Act had a broad base of support, but there were also criticisms from certain groups, like business owners who didn't want to pay taxes for it. So maybe the support wasn't in the 80s or 90s, but more like 60-70%.

I think I've heard that about two-thirds of the population supported it. Two-thirds is about 66%, which would be closest to 70%, but maybe the question rounds to 60%? Or maybe the exact figure is 60%.

Alternatively, perhaps the support was higher, like 80%. I'm not sure. I'm trying to recall if there were any specific polls from that time. I think Gallup didn't exist back then, but maybe some other polling data.

Wait, another angle: the Social Security Act was passed in 1935, and it was a significant shift in government policy. It's possible that a large majority supported it because of the economic hardship. So maybe the support was around 80% or higher.

But I'm not confident. I think the most commonly cited figure I've heard is around 60%, so option C is 60%. Alternatively, maybe it's higher.

Wait, maybe I should think about the political opposition. The Act was part of the New Deal, which was controversial. But the general public was in favor. I think the support was around 60-70%, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, perhaps the support was as high as 90%, but that seems too high. I think 60% is more plausible.

So, I'm leaning towards option C: 60% or option I:70%. But I'm not sure which.

Wait, maybe I should think about when the law was passed. The Social Security Act was signed into law in August 1935. The public had been through the Depression, and there was a lot of support for government intervention to help people.

I think the correct answer is around 60%, so option C. But another part of me thinks it's higher, maybe 70% or 80%.

Alternatively, I recall that when Social Security was being debated, there was opposition from groups like the American Medical Association against other parts of the New Deal, but for Social Security, the support was strong. Maybe around 80%?

I'm a bit stuck. Let me think of another approach. I'll try to remember any specific percentages. I think a common figure is that about two-thirds of the population supported Social Security when it was introduced. Two-thirds is about 66.6%, which would be closest to 70%, but maybe the options don't have 66%, so 60% or 70%.

Looking back at the options, C is 60%, I is 70%. So which is more accurate? I'm not exactly sure, but I think 60% might be the more commonly cited figure, perhaps because it was a significant majority but not overwhelming.

Alternatively, I've read that when Social Security was passed, it had the support of about 80% of the public. That would make option G:80% the correct answer. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another thought: the Social Security Act was part of the second New Deal, which was more progressive. It had strong public support because people saw it as necessary. So maybe the support was higher than 60%, like 80%.

But without a clear memory, it's hard. I think I'll go with option C:60% as a safer estimate, but I'm not entirely sure.

The Social Security Act of 1935 was a significant component of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, introduced during the Great Depression when public support for government intervention was high. The Act aimed to provide financial assistance to the elderly, unemployed, and other vulnerable populations, addressing the dire economic conditions of the time.

While there was some opposition, particularly from business interests concerned about taxes and government overreach, the general public was largely in favor. Historical context suggests that the Act enjoyed substantial public support, likely due to its focus on relief during a period of widespread hardship.

Considering the options provided, extreme percentages like 20%, 30%, 40%, and 100% are unlikely. Similarly, 50% seems too low given the desperation of the times. The more plausible figures are 60%, 70%, 80%, or 90%. Two-thirds (approximately 66.6%) is often cited as the level of support, which aligns closely with 70%. However, 60% is also a commonly referenced figure and may be the more conservative estimate.

Given the historical context and the need to choose the most reasonable answer, 60% seems a plausible and frequently cited estimate of public support for the Social Security Act in 1935.
