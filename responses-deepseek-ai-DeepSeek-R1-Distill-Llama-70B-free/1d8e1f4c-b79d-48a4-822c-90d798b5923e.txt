Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about work-related accidents and the characteristics of people who have them. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's see what the question says.

The question is asking which option is true about persons who have work-related accidents. The options are A through H, each making a different claim. I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that workplace accidents can be influenced by various factors, including age, stress levels, job satisfaction, and other personal characteristics. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: They are more likely to have had job promotions. I'm not sure about this. If someone is promoted, maybe they're more experienced, but does that relate to accidents? Maybe not. Or wait, promotions could mean more responsibilities, which might increase stress, but I don't know if that leads to accidents. I'm not certain about A.

Option B: They have fewer responsibilities. I don't think that's right. People with fewer responsibilities might be less experienced or in entry-level positions. But I'm not sure if that makes them more accident-prone. Maybe it's the opposite because more responsibility could mean more stress or more complex tasks, which might increase accident risk.

Option C: They are less likely to have had promotions. Hmm, if they haven't been promoted, maybe they're in lower positions. But I'm not sure how promotions relate to accidents. I don't have a strong opinion on this one.

Option D: They are younger. I think I've heard that younger workers might have more accidents. Maybe because they're less experienced or more prone to taking risks. That sounds plausible. Younger people might not have the same level of safety awareness as older, more experienced workers. So D could be a contender.

Option E: They've had more recent life stress. Stress can definitely affect someone's focus and judgment. If someone is stressed, they might be more distracted at work, leading to accidents. I remember reading that stress is a factor in workplace injuries. So E seems like a strong possibility.

Option F: They are more physically fit. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If someone is more fit, they might be less likely to have accidents because they're in better shape. Or maybe in jobs that require more physical fitness, there's more risk of injury. But I'm not sure. I don't think F is correct because it's counterintuitive. More fit people might actually have fewer accidents, but I'm not certain.

Option G: They are less intelligent. That seems like a stereotype. I don't think intelligence directly correlates with accidents. It might depend more on other factors like training or attention to safety protocols. So I probably don't agree with G.

Option H: They take more sick leave. Well, if someone has an accident, they might need more time off to recover, so they'd take sick leave. But does having an accident mean they take more sick leave in general, or is it just after the accident? The question is about people who have accidents tending to do something. So if they have more accidents, they might use more sick leave. H could be a possibility, but I'm not sure if it's the best answer compared to others.

Now, I need to think about which factors are most strongly linked to workplace accidents. I remember that stress is a significant factor. People under stress might be more distracted, leading to accidents. So option E seems correct. Also, younger workers (option D) are more likely to have accidents, but I'm not sure if that's the best choice here.

Let me try to rank the options. The question is about what people who have work accidents tend to do or have. So which option is a known risk factor.

I think life stress (option E) is a known contributor. High stress can impair cognitive functions, leading to more mistakes and accidents. So E seems like the right answer.

Wait, but what about option H? If someone has an accident, they might take sick leave, but does that mean they are more likely to take sick leave in general? Or is it just after the accident? The question is about people who have accidents, so perhaps H is a result rather than a cause. The question is about their tendencies before the accident. So H might not be the correct answer because it's about after the accident.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is E: have had more recent life stress than accident-free workers.

The question asks about the characteristics of persons who have work-related accidents. Each option is analyzed as follows:

- **Option A**: Suggests that individuals with accidents are more likely to have had promotions. This is unlikely, as promotions may not directly correlate with accident risk.
- **Option B**: Proposes that they have fewer responsibilities, but this is also questionable, as responsibilities may not be a direct indicator of accident propensity.
- **Option C**: States that they are less likely to have had promotions, but this is not strongly supported by logic or evidence.
- **Option D**: Suggests that they are younger, which is plausible, as younger workers might be less experienced or more prone to risk-taking.
- **Option E**: Indicates that they have had more recent life stress, which is a strong contender, as stress can impair focus and judgment, leading to accidents.
- **Option F**: Claims they are more physically fit, which seems counterintuitive, as better physical fitness might reduce accident risk.
- **Option G**: Suggests they are less intelligent, which is not supported and seems like a stereotype.
- **Option H**: States that they take more sick leave, which could be a result of accidents rather than a pre-existing tendency.

Among these, **Option E** stands out as the most plausible answer, as life stress is a known risk factor for workplace accidents. Stress can lead to distraction and impaired decision-making, increasing the likelihood of accidents. While younger workers (Option D) might also be at higher risk, the question focuses on tendencies, and stress is a more direct contributor.

Answer: E
