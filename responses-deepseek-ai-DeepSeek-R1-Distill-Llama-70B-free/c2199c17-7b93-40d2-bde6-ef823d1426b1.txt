Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about oligopoly characteristics, and I need to figure out which option is not a characteristic. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that oligopoly is a market structure with a few firms. So, looking at the options, option D says "Few firms," which definitely fits because oligopoly means exactly that—so D is a characteristic, not the answer.

Next, option A: P = MC. I think in perfect competition, firms set price equal to marginal cost because they're price takers. But in oligopoly, since firms have more market power, they might not necessarily do this. Wait, or do they? I'm a bit confused here. I think oligopolies can sometimes set prices where marginal revenue equals marginal cost, but whether price equals MC depends on the situation. Maybe in some models, but I'm not sure if that's a defining characteristic. I'll have to come back to this.

Option B is non-price competition. Oligopolies often engage in advertising, brand differentiation, etc., rather than just cutting prices. So B is definitely a characteristic of oligopoly. So B is not the answer.

Option C: Price-maker. Oligopolies have some pricing power because there are few firms, so they can influence prices. So C is a characteristic—so not the answer.

Option E: Strong barriers to entry. Yes, oligopolies typically have high barriers to entry, making it hard for new firms to join. So E is a characteristic.

Option F: Perfect knowledge. Hmm, I don't think oligopolies have perfect knowledge. Perfect knowledge is more like in perfect competition where everyone knows everything. In oligopoly, firms might have imperfect information about each other's strategies. So F might be the answer because it's not a characteristic.

Option G: Homogeneous product. Wait, some oligopolies have homogeneous products, like in certain commodity markets, but others have differentiated products. So is this a universal characteristic? Or is it that sometimes they have homogeneous, sometimes not. But the question is about which is NOT a characteristic. So if some oligopolies have homogeneous products, then it's a possible characteristic. But if others don't, then it's not a necessary characteristic. Hmm, but I'm not sure. 

Option H: Limited competition. Since there are few firms, competition is limited, so H is a characteristic.

So going back, the question is which is NOT a characteristic. So the options that are not characteristics are either F or G, perhaps.

Wait, in perfect competition, all firms are price takers, so P=MC. In oligopolies, firms are price-makers, so they might set prices where MR=MC, not necessarily P=MC. So for option A, P=MC, that's more of a perfect competition trait, not oligopoly. So A might be the answer.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Because in some oligopoly models, like the kinked demand curve model, firms might set prices where MR=MC, but not necessarily P=MC. So P=MC isn't a standard characteristic of oligopoly.

So now I'm thinking between options A and F.

Wait, in the question, the options are about which is not a characteristic. So if A is P=MC, is that a characteristic? Probably not, because oligopolies set their own prices, not necessarily where P=MC. So A is not a characteristic.

But wait, let me think again. In a monopoly, the firm sets MR=MC, but P is greater than MC. In oligopoly, same thing—so P isn't equal to MC. So A would not be a characteristic of oligopoly.

So the options not a characteristic: F is perfect knowledge, which is not a trait. Because in oligopoly, knowledge isn't perfect. So F is not a characteristic, so F would be the answer.

Wait, but earlier I thought about option G. Do oligopolies have homogeneous products? It depends. Some do, like in certain industries where the product is the same, but many have differentiated products. So G is not a universal characteristic, but the question is which is not a characteristic. So if the question is about which is not a characteristic, maybe G is not necessarily present, but the question is phrased as which is not a characteristic—so which one is not generally true.

Wait, the question is: which of the following is NOT a characteristic of oligopoly.

So, looking at each option:

A: P=MC. Not a characteristic, since oligopolies don't set P=MC.

B: Non-price competition. Yes, a characteristic.

C: Price-maker. Yes.

D: Few firms. Yes.

E: Strong barriers. Yes.

F: Perfect knowledge. No, because that's more of perfect competition.

G: Homogeneous product. Sometimes, but not always. So it's not a defining characteristic.

H: Limited competition. Yes.

So the options not characteristics are A, F, and G.

Wait, the options given are from A to H, and the correct answer is one of them.

The question asks which is not a characteristic.

So, which of these is not a characteristic. Let's go through each:

A: P=MC. In oligopoly, price is set above MC because firms have market power. So P=MC isn't true. So A is not a characteristic.

F: Perfect knowledge. Oligopoly firms don't have perfect knowledge, so F is not a characteristic.

G: Homogeneous product. Some oligopolies have this, some don't. So it's not a necessary characteristic.

So the question is which is NOT a characteristic. So all three (A, F, G) could be possible, but the options only have one correct answer.

Looking back at the options, which one is definitely not a characteristic.

I think the standard answer is that in oligopoly, there's imperfect knowledge, so F (Perfect knowledge) is not a characteristic. So F is the answer.

Alternatively, maybe A is also not a characteristic, but I'm a bit torn.

Wait, I'm a bit confused about whether P=MC happens in oligopoly. In perfect competition, yes. In oligopoly, no. So A is not a characteristic.

But in the options, both A and F are possible answers. So perhaps I need to evaluate the options again.

Wait, the question is which is not a characteristic. So the correct answer should be the option that is not true about oligopolies.

Looking at the answer options, the correct answer is F: Perfect knowledge. Because oligopolies operate under imperfect knowledge; they don't have perfect information about each other's actions or market conditions. So F is not a characteristic.

So the answer would be F.

Wait, but I've also thought that A is not a characteristic. So I'm a bit confused. Let me try to recall what each term means.

In oligopoly, each firm is a price maker, so they set prices, but they don't set P=MC. Instead, they set where MR=MC, which is generally below the demand curve, so P is above MC. So P=MC is not a characteristic of oligopoly. So A is not a characteristic.

Looking at the options, the question is which is not a characteristic. So the correct answer could be either A or F.

Wait, but in the options, the possible answers are A to H. The correct answer, according to what I know, is that oligopolies do not have perfect knowledge, so F is not a characteristic. Also, P=MC is not a characteristic, so A is not a characteristic.

Hmm, but the question has only one correct answer. So perhaps I'm mistaken.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is F. Because in oligopolies, firms have limited knowledge about each other's strategies and actions, which leads to things like game theory scenarios. So perfect knowledge is not a characteristic.

So in that case, the answer is F.

Alternatively, another approach: which of these is a characteristic of perfect competition and not oligopoly?

A: P=MC. That's perfect competition.

F: Perfect knowledge is also a characteristic of perfect competition.

So in the question, which is not a characteristic of oligopoly, so both A and F are not. But the options only have one correct answer.

Wait, but the options given are A through H, and the correct answer is among them. So perhaps the intended answer is F, because perfect knowledge isn't an oligopoly trait.

Wait, the options are:

A: P = MC.

B: Non-price competition.

C: Price-maker.

D: Few firms.

E: Strong barriers to entry.

F: Perfect knowledge.

G: Homogeneous product.

H: Limited competition.

So the answer options are A to H, but the correct answer is one of them.

So, the question is which is NOT a characteristic. So, in an oligopoly, do firms have perfect knowledge? No, so F is not a characteristic. So F is the correct answer.

Alternatively, A is also not a characteristic because P=MC is for perfect competition. So maybe the correct answer is A or F.

Wait, perhaps I should think about each option.

Option A: P=MC. In oligopoly, because firms have market power, they set prices above MC. So P is not equal to MC, so A is not a characteristic.

Option F: Perfect knowledge. Oligopolies don't have perfect knowledge, so F is not a characteristic.

So both A and F are not characteristics, but the options only have one correct answer. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the options.

Wait, maybe the question is referring to "characteristic" as in "a usual feature," so which one is definitely not a feature.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that oligopolies can sometimes have P=MC if the market is competitive, but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, in the kinked demand model, the price might not adjust much, but P isn't necessarily equal to MC.

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. But in standard economic theory, I think both A and F are not characteristics. But since each question has only one correct answer, perhaps the intended answer is F.

Wait, looking at the options again, the question is about which is not a characteristic. So the answer would be F: Perfect knowledge, because oligopolies don't have it.

So I think the correct answer is F.

To determine which option is not a characteristic of oligopoly, let's analyze each option:

- **A: P = MC**  
  In oligopoly, firms are price-makers and set prices where marginal revenue (MR) equals marginal cost (MC), not necessarily where price (P) equals MC. This is more characteristic of perfect competition. Therefore, P = MC is not a characteristic of oligopoly.

- **B: Non-price competition**  
  Oligopolies often engage in non-price competition, such as advertising and product differentiation, to compete with rivals. This is a characteristic of oligopoly.

- **C: Price-maker**  
  Oligopolies have pricing power and are price-makers, as they can influence market prices. This is a characteristic of oligopoly.

- **D: Few firms**  
  Oligopoly is defined by the presence of a small number of firms. This is a characteristic of oligopoly.

- **E: Strong barriers to entry**  
  Oligopolies typically have strong barriers to entry, making it difficult for new firms to join the market. This is a characteristic of oligopoly.

- **F: Perfect knowledge**  
  Oligopolies operate under imperfect knowledge, as firms do not have full information about each other's strategies or market conditions. Perfect knowledge is a characteristic of perfect competition, not oligopoly.

- **G: Homogeneous product**  
  Some oligopolies have homogeneous products, but many have differentiated products. While this can be a characteristic in certain cases, it is not a defining feature of oligopoly.

- **H: Limited competition**  
  With few firms in the market, competition is limited in oligopoly. This is a characteristic of oligopoly.

From this analysis, both **A (P = MC)** and **F (Perfect knowledge)** are not characteristics of oligopoly. However, since the question asks for a single correct answer, **F (Perfect knowledge)** is the most appropriate choice, as perfect knowledge is explicitly a characteristic of perfect competition and not oligopoly.

**Answer: F**
