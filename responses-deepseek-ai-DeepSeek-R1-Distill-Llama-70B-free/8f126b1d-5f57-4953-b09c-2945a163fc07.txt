Okay, so I've got this question about Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Hmm, I remember that Maslow's theory is all about different levels of human needs, arranged in a pyramid. The lower levels are more basic, and the higher ones are more about personal growth.

The question is asking about esteem needs and which need must be at least partially met before moving on to the next. So, I think the hierarchy goes from the bottom up as: physiological, safety, love/belonging, esteem, and then self-actualization. So, after esteem comes self-actualization.

Wait, but the question is phrased a bit differently. It says that esteem needs must be at least partially met before one is prompted to satisfy something else. So, what comes after esteem? Oh right, self-actualization. So the next level is self-actualization.

Looking at the options, option A is self-actualization. So I think the answer is A.

Wait, but let me make sure. Maslow's hierarchy goes like this:

1. Physiological (basic needs like food, water)
2. Safety (security, protection)
3. Love and belonging (relationships, social)
4. Esteem (respect, recognition, confidence)
5. Self-actualization (personal growth, realizing potential)

So the progression is that once the lower needs are met, you move up. So to pursue self-actualization, you need to have the esteem needs met at least partially. So yes, the answer should be A: self-actualization needs.

The question asks which need must be partially met before moving to the next according to Maslow's hierarchy. Maslow's hierarchy progresses from physiological needs at the base to self-actualization at the top. Esteem needs are the fourth level, followed by self-actualization. Therefore, self-actualization is the next need after esteem.

Answer: A
