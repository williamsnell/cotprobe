Alright, so I have this question about John Glenn and which military branch he served in as a pilot. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on my history, but I remember he was an astronaut, one of the first Americans in space. But the question is about his military service before that.

I think John Glenn was a Marine. Wait, no, maybe it was the Navy? Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think. I recall that a lot of the early astronauts came from a military background, especially the Navy and Air Force. Glenn was part of the Mercury Seven, right? Those were the first seven astronauts selected by NASA.

Wait, I think John Glenn was a Marine Corps pilot. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me try to break it down. The Mercury Seven included people like Alan Shepard, Gus Grissom, and John Glenn. I believe Alan Shepard was a Navy pilot, so that's different. Gus Grissom was in the Air Force, I think.

So if Glenn wasn't in the Navy, perhaps he was in the Marines. Or maybe the Air Force? No, I think the Air Force was more for someone else. Wait, another thought: Glenn served in both World War II and the Korean War. I remember reading that he was a fighter pilot in Korea. The Marines have a lot of fighter pilots, right? So that would make sense.

But wait, I'm not 100% certain. Let me try to recall any other clues. After his NASA career, didn't he become a politician? Yes, he was a U.S. Senator from Ohio. But that's not directly relevant here.

Okay, so options are the Marines (C) or maybe the Air Force (D). Wait, another angle: the military branches. The Air Force was established after World War II, so during the Korean War, which was in the early 50s, the Air Force was already active. So if Glenn was a pilot in the Korean War, could he have been in the Air Force? Or was he in the Marines?

I'm trying to remember specific details. I think that John Glenn flew F-86 Sabre jets in Korea. The F-86 was a prominent Air Force fighter during the Korean War. But wait, the Marines also had their own aircraft. Or perhaps it was the Navy's planes.

Wait, no, the F-86 was primarily an Air Force plane. So if he flew that, maybe he was in the Air Force. But I thought he was a Marine. Hmm, this is confusing.

Alternatively, I remember that John Glenn was a Marine Corps aviator. He served in both WWII and Korea as a Marine pilot. So perhaps the correct answer is the Marines, which is option C.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Another approach: looking up the answer in my mind. I think I read that John Glenn was a colonel in the Marine Corps when he retired. So that would mean he was in the Marines. So the answer should be C: Marines.

But wait, let me double-check. I might be mixing up details with other astronauts. For example, Alan Shepard was a Navy test pilot. John Glenn, on the other hand, was a Marine. So yes, I think C is the correct answer.
