Alright, so I've got this question about ethical relativism and human rights. Hmm, I need to figure out which of the given options is the strongest argument against ethical relativism's hostility to human rights. Let's break this down.

First, I should remember what ethical relativism is. From what I know, ethical relativism is the idea that moral judgments are relative to cultural norms. So, what's right or wrong depends on the culture, and there's no universal standard. That's why relativists might be hostile to human rights, because human rights imply a universal set of standards that apply to everyone, regardless of culture.

The question is asking which of these theories or concepts provides the strongest argument against that hostility. So, the correct answer should be a theory that supports the idea of universal moral standards or human rights.

Let's look at the options:

A: Cognitivism. Cognitivism is the belief that moral statements can be true or false, like facts. It's a meta-ethical view. I'm not sure how directly this opposes relativism regarding human rights. Maybe because if moral statements can be true, then some universal rights could be true, but I'm not certain if this is the strongest argument.

B: Social Contract Theory. This theory suggests that moral and political obligations are based on a contract between individuals. Thinkers like Locke or Rawls come to mind. Social contract theory can support human rights because it's about the rules a society agrees upon, which could include universal rights. But does it directly counter relativism's cultural dependency? Maybe, but I'm not sure it's the strongest.

C: Utilitarianism. Utilitarianism is about maximizing overall happiness or utility. It's more of a consequentialist theory. While it can support human rights if they lead to greater utility, it's not necessarily a direct argument against relativism's rejection of universals. Relativists might argue that utility varies by culture, so this might not be the strongest.

D: Empiricism. Empiricism is the idea that knowledge comes from experience and observation. I'm not sure how this directly ties into the argument against relativism. It's more about how we know things rather than the moral framework.

E: Nihilism. Nihilism is the belief that life lacks inherent meaning or value. That seems more extreme and might actually support relativism rather than oppose it, or at least not provide a basis for human rights.

F: Positivism. Positivism holds that valid knowledge comes from science and observation. Legal positivism, for example, says laws are human-made. But again, this might not directly counter relativism's stance on human rights, unless it's about the existence of laws, but I don't see a strong link.

G: Rationalism. Rationalism emphasizes the role of reason in knowledge and ethics. If human rights can be derived from reason, that would argue against cultural relativism. For example, Kantian ethics is based on reason and would support universal moral laws. So rationalism could argue that some rights are universal because they're based on reason, not culture.

H: Communitarianism. This focuses on community and the common good. It might emphasize local norms over universal rights, which could actually align with relativism, so it might not be the answer.

I: Existentialism. Existentialism is about individual freedom and choice. It doesn't directly provide a basis for universal human rights, so probably not the answer.

J: Deontological Ethics. Deontological ethics focuses on duties and rules, like Kant's categorical imperative. It argues that certain actions are inherently right or wrong, regardless of consequences. This would support universal human rights because these rights are based on moral duties that apply to everyone, not just cultural norms. So this seems like a strong argument against relativism.

Now, comparing the options, both G (Rationalism) and J (Deontological Ethics) seem relevant. Rationalism provides a basis for universal principles through reason, while deontological ethics provides specific moral rules that are universal.

But which is the stronger argument? Deontological ethics directly posits that certain rights are based on moral duties, which are universal. Rationalism supports the idea that reason can derive universal principles, which would include human rights. Both are strong, but I think deontological ethics might be more specific in its opposition to relativism because it's about moral rules, while rationalism is more about the method (reason) to arrive at those rules.

Wait, but the question is about the strongest argument against ethical relativism's hostility to human rights. So, the argument would be that human rights are based on universal moral principles, not cultural norms. Deontological ethics, which is about duties and rights, would directly argue for the existence of universal rights. So J might be the answer.

Alternatively, Social Contract Theory (B) also posits that certain rights are agreed upon, but that's more about societal agreements rather than universal moral laws. So maybe J is better.

Another angle: Ethical relativism says moral judgments are relative to culture. The strongest counter would be a theory that asserts the existence of objective, universal moral truths. Deontological ethics does that by asserting that certain duties and rights are universal, regardless of culture.

So I think the answer is J: Deontological Ethics.

The strongest argument against ethical relativism's hostility to human rights is **Deontological Ethics**. Ethical relativism posits that moral judgments are relative to cultural norms, which can lead to a rejection of universal human rights. Deontological ethics, however, asserts that certain rights and duties are inherently universal and based on moral principles, such as Kant's categorical imperative, which applies to all individuals regardless of cultural context. This directly challenges relativism by grounding human rights in objective moral rules rather than cultural variability.

Answer: J
