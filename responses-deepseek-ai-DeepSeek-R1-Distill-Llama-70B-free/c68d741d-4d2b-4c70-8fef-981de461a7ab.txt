Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about the Tiwanaku culture and which other culture eclipsed their influence, specifically to the north and west. Hmm, I remember that Tiwanaku was a pre-Columbian civilization in the Andean region, located around present-day Bolivia. They were known for their impressive stone structures and were a major power in the region, especially around 300 to 1000 AD.

The question is asking which culture took over their influence, more towards the north and west. I think the options include various cultures like Olmec, Maya, Aztec, Inca, and others. Wait, I need to think about the timeline and the geographical locations of these cultures.

Tiwanaku's influence began to decline around the 11th century, I believe. After that, other cultures rose in the area. One of the major civilizations that came after Tiwanaku was the Inca Empire, but I'm not sure if the Inca directly eclipsed Tiwanaku's influence. The Inca Empire was much later, though, like from the 13th to 16th century.

Wait, there's another group called the Wari. I think they were a Middle Horizon culture, flourishing around 500 to 1000 AD. Their capital was near modern-day Ayacucho, Peru. The Wari are known for their expansion and influence over other regions. They expanded into areas that were previously under Tiwanaku's control, maybe absorbing some of their territories.

So, the Tiwanaku was in the south, around Lake Titicaca, and the Wari were more to the north and west of them. So the Wari culture would have eclipsed Tiwanaku's influence in those regions.

Looking at the options, option J is Wari. So the answer should be J.

The Tiwanaku civilization, located near Lake Titicaca, was a significant power in the Andean region from around 300 to 1000 AD. As their influence declined around the 11th century, the Wari culture emerged as a dominant force, expanding from their capital near Ayacucho, Peru, and absorbing territories previously under Tiwanaku's control. The Wari were situated to the north and west of Tiwanaku, making them the culture that eclipsed Tiwanaku's influence in those areas.

Answer: J
