Question:

A company is interested in comparing the mean sales revenue per salesperson at two different locations. The manager takes a random sample of 10 salespeople from each location independently and records the sales revenue generated by each person during the last four weeks. He decides to use a t-test to compare the mean sales revenue at the two locations. Which of the following assumptions is necessary for the validity of the t-test?

Options:

A: The population of the sales records at each location is not normally distributed.
B: The population of the sales records at each location is normally distributed.
C: The sample size at both locations is less than 30
D: The population standard deviations at both locations are equal.
E: The sales revenue is measured on an interval or ratio scale.
F: The population of the sales records at each location follows a uniform distribution.
G: The population standard deviations at both locations are not equal.
H: The population standard deviations at both locations are known.
I: The population mean sales revenue at both locations are not equal.
J: The population mean sales revenue at both locations are equal.

Okay, so I have this statistics question here about t-tests. Let me think through it step by step. The question is about a company comparing mean sales revenue per salesperson at two locations. They took random samples from each location, 10 salespeople each, and the manager wants to use a t-test to compare the means.

The question asks which assumption is necessary for the validity of the t-test. The options are from A to J. I remember that t-tests have certain assumptions, especially regarding the populations from which the samples are drawn.

First, I should recall what kind of t-test this is. Since they're comparing two independent samples (from two different locations), it's an independent samples t-test. Now, the key assumptions for an independent t-test are that the data in each group is normally distributed, and the variances (or standard deviations) of the two populations are equal. Also, the samples should be randomly selected, which they are in this case.

Wait, but I think there's an alternative when the variances aren't equal. Oh right, that's when you use Welch's t-test instead of the standard t-test which assumes equal variances. So the standard t-test assumes equal variances, but if they aren't equal, you have to adjust.

Looking at the options, option D says the population standard deviations are equal. So that would be an assumption for the standard t-test. Option G says they are not equal, which would be when you don't use the standard t-test. So D is an assumption for the t-test's validity here.

Another assumption is normality. The populations should be normally distributed. Option B states that, so that's another necessary assumption.

Wait, but the question is about the necessary assumptions, so it's possible more than one option is correct, but in the options provided, each is a separate choice. The question asks which is necessary, so perhaps the correct answer includes both B and D. But looking at the options, each is a single choice.

Wait, the question is about which assumption is necessary, not all. So perhaps each option is a possible choice. So the question is which one of them is necessary.

Wait, another thought: when using a t-test, especially the independent samples t-test, the two main assumptions are normality and homogeneity of variances. If the sample sizes are small, the normality assumption becomes more important. Since here the sample size is 10 each, which is small, the assumption of normality is crucial because the Central Limit Theorem might not kick in as strongly.

So which of the options covers that? Option B says the population is normally distributed. So that's necessary.

But wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The t-test requires:

1. The dependent variable is interval/ratio data. That's usually a given, but in this case, sales revenue is definitely ratio data, so E is probably true but isn't one of the main assumptions being tested here.

2. Independence of observations: Samples are taken independently, so that's satisfied.

3. Normality: Populations should be normally distributed. So B is an assumption.

4. Homogeneity of variances (equal variances across populations) if using the standard t-test. So D is another assumption.

But the question is about which is necessary for the t-test's validity. So both B and D are necessary. But the options are individual choices.

Wait, the question is giving options A to J, each a possible correct answer. So which of these is an assumption needed?

Looking back, the question is phrased: "Which of the following assumptions is necessary for the validity of the t-test?"

So it's possible that more than one is correct, but the way the options are presented, each is a separate option.

Wait, the options are:

A: Population not normally distributed → No, because t-test assumes normality.

B: Population normally distributed → Yes.

C: Sample size <30 → Not necessarily; t-tests can be used with larger samples, but small samples require more careful checking of assumptions.

D: Population SDs equal → For the standard t-test, yes.

E: Data is interval/ratio → Correct, but usually, this is a given, not an assumption being tested.

F: Uniform distribution → No, t-test doesn't assume that.

G: SDs not equal → No, that's when you can't assume homogeneity.

H: SDs known → No, t-test uses sample SDs, not population (z-test uses known SDs).

I: Population means not equal → No, because the t-test is to determine if they are equal or not. It's not an assumption; it's what you're testing.

J: Population means equal → No, same as I.

So the necessary assumptions are B and D, but each is a separate option. The question is asking which of the options is necessary, so both B and D are correct. But since it's multiple-choice with single answers, perhaps the question expects both B and D to be correct assumptions, but the options are presented individually.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering whether the test is a pooled variance t-test or Welch's. If the variances are equal (D), then the pooled variance is used. If not, Welch's. But the question says he's using a t-test, which could be either, but traditionally, the standard t-test assumes equal variances.

So the required assumptions would be normality (B) and equal variances (D).

But the question gives options, so which one is among the choices. The question is which is necessary, so perhaps both B and D are correct, but the options don't have "both B and D", so perhaps the question is looking for one of them.

Wait, looking back, the question is which is necessary, so both are necessary. But the options are each single letters.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is either B or D. But looking at the options, each is a separate choice. So perhaps the intended answer is B and D, but since the options are individual, maybe the question expects two correct answers. But the way the question is phrased, it's a single choice.

Wait, perhaps in the context of the question, the assumption that the populations are normally distributed is more critical, especially with small sample sizes. But the t-test also requires that the variances are equal unless using Welch's.

Alternatively, maybe the question is considering whether it's a one-sample or two-sample test. But in this case, it's two-sample.

Wait, the question says, "compare the mean sales revenue at two different locations." So it's a two-sample t-test.

In that case, the two main assumptions are:

1. Each sample comes from a normally distributed population in terms of the dependent variable.

2. The variances of the two populations are equal (homogeneity of variance).

So both B and D are assumptions.

But the options don't have a combination, so perhaps the correct answer is both B and D, but the options don't allow that. So maybe the question is only looking for one of them, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering whether to use a pooled variance or not. If the sample sizes are equal, sometimes the homogeneity assumption is considered less critical, but that's not the case here.

Wait, the sample size is 10 each, which is small, so both assumptions (normality and equal variances) are important.

But the question is which of the following is necessary. So looking at the options, both B and D are necessary.

But the options don't have a choice that includes both, so perhaps the correct answer is B and D.

But the way the question is structured, the answer is to pick one letter. So maybe the intended correct answer is B and D, but in the options, perhaps the question expects B as the answer, because without normality, the t-test isn't valid even if variances are unequal. Or perhaps it's the other way around.

Alternatively, maybe the question is mixing up some concepts. Wait, no—the t-test's validity hinges on both normality and homogeneity when using the pooled variance version.

So perhaps the correct answer is option B and D. But since each is a separate option, perhaps the question is looking for both, but the options don't allow that. Therefore, the question might have intended that both are correct, but in the provided options, each is a single choice.

Wait, but the options list each as individual, so perhaps the question expects both, but the answer must be one of the letters. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is B and D, but since I can only choose one, I'm a bit stuck.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only testing one of the assumptions. Let me think again. The question is about the necessary assumptions for the t-test's validity.

So, in the context of the problem, the two key assumptions are:

- The populations are normally distributed (B is correct).

- The population variances are equal (D is correct).

But the options are each single choices. So perhaps the question is looking for both, but since that's not an option, maybe the intended answer is B, because without normality, the t-test results are not reliable, especially with small samples.

Wait, but equal variances are also important. If the variances are unequal, you can't use the pooled variance t-test. So both are necessary.

Hmm. I think I might have to pick the best answer possible. Among the options, both B and D are correct, but perhaps the question expects both.

Wait, but looking back, perhaps the question is only asking for one of the assumptions, not all. So, perhaps the answer is B and D.

But the options don't include a combination. Oh wait, the options are A through J, each a single statement. So the correct answer must be either B or D.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering that the t-test requires the data to be from a normal distribution, making B the correct answer.

Alternatively, when the population variances are unknown and equal, the t-test uses the pooled variance estimate, so D is necessary.

I'm a bit torn, but I think both are necessary. However, in the context of multiple-choice questions, the answer is likely B and D. But since each is a separate option, perhaps the intended answer is B and D, but the question allows only one choice.

Wait, perhaps the intended answer is B. Because without normality, even with equal variances, the t-test isn't valid. Alternatively, without equal variances, you can't use the standard t-test, but you can use Welch's.

Wait, but in the question, the manager decides to use a t-test. It doesn't specify which type. So if the manager is using the standard t-test (assuming equal variances), then D is an assumption. If using Welch's, then D isn't assumed.

But the question is about the assumptions necessary for the t-test's validity, implying the standard t-test. So D is necessary.

Wait, but in that case, the answer would be both B and D, but again, each is a separate option.

This is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to list each option:

A: Population not normally distributed. → Incorrect, t-test assumes normality.

B: Population normally distributed. → Correct.

C: Sample size <30. → Not necessarily an assumption. It's about when the CLT might apply, but for t-test, sample size isn't an assumption per se; it's about whether to use t or z.

D: Population SDs equal. → Correct for standard t-test.

E: Interval/ratio. → Correct, but usually a given, not an assumption being tested.

F: Uniform distribution. → Incorrect.

G: SDs not equal. → Incorrect for standard t-test.

H: SDs known. → Incorrect, t-test uses sample SDs.

I: Means not equal. → Not an assumption.

J: Means equal. → Not an assumption.

So the necessary assumptions are B and D.

But the options are separate, so perhaps the question expects both. However, the options don't have a 'both B and D' choice. So perhaps the intended answer is B and D, but we have to choose the best possible.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that the t-test requires the data to be normally distributed, so the answer is B. Alternatively, it could require equal variances, making D the answer.

I think I remember that for the independent t-test, the two main assumptions are normality and homogeneity of variance.

So in the given options, both B and D are necessary. But since it's multiple-choice with single answers, perhaps the intended answer includes both, but the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps the question is only testing one of the assumptions. Let me think again—what is the most critical assumption for the t-test?

I think both are critical, but without knowing which the question focuses on, perhaps the answer is B.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is a bit of a trick because the sample size is small (10 each), so the normality assumption is even more important. So the answer would be B.

Alternatively, the question might have intended D as the answer, considering that in the t-test, homogeneity of variance is an assumption when using the pooled variance method.

Hmm. I'm a bit stuck, but I think the most accurate answer is that both B and D are necessary. However, since that's not an option, I have to choose between them.

Wait, perhaps looking up the standard assumptions for the independent t-test: They are that each sample is drawn from a normally distributed population, and the populations have equal variances.

So both B and D are necessary.

But the options don't have a combined choice, so perhaps the correct answer is both B and D, but since each is an option, perhaps the question expects both. However, the way the question is phrased, I have to choose the best possible.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is only testing for one of them. In that case, perhaps the answer is B, because normality is a fundamental assumption, and without it, the t-test can't be applied regardless of variance.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D, because the question mentions using a t-test, implying the standard t-test which requires equal variances.

I'm a bit conflicted, but I'll go with B and D being the correct assumptions. However, the options don't allow selecting multiple, so perhaps the intended answer is B and D, but since I can't choose both, I'll have to pick one.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering that the t-test requires the data to be on an interval or ratio scale (E). But that's more of a requirement for the mean to be meaningful, not specifically for the t-test's validity beyond that.

So, considering all this, I think the correct answer is both B and D, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is B and D. Therefore, I think I should select both, but since I can't, I'll have to pick one.

Wait, perhaps the question is only testing one of them. I think the most commonly tested assumption is normality, so the answer is B.

Alternatively, the question might be testing the equal variances, making D the answer.

I think I'll have to make a decision. Given that, I'll say the answer is B and D, but since I can't choose both, I'll go with B and D as the correct assumptions. But the options are individual, so perhaps the intended answer is B and D. But in the context of the question, perhaps it's B.

Wait, another approach: The question asks which assumption is necessary. So each of B and D is necessary, so the correct answer would include both. But since the options don't have that, perhaps the intended answer is B.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the two-sample t-test with pooled variances, which requires D. So perhaps the answer is D.

I'm getting a bit stuck, but I think the correct answer is that both B and D are necessary, but since I can't choose both, I'll have to pick one. I think the question expects both, but perhaps in the options, the intended answer is B and D. But I can't choose both, so I'll have to select the best possible.

Wait, considering that the sample size is 10, which is small, the assumption of normality is more crucial. So the answer is B.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is more about the variance assumption, making D the answer.

I think I need to make a choice here. I'll go with B as the necessary assumption because normality is a fundamental requirement for the t-test, especially with small samples.

The question involves a company comparing the mean sales revenue per salesperson at two locations using a t-test. The manager takes random samples of 10 salespeople from each location and uses a t-test to compare the means. The question asks which assumption is necessary for the validity of the t-test.

To determine the correct answer, we need to consider the assumptions of an independent samples t-test. The two key assumptions are:

1. **Normality**: The data in each population should be normally distributed. This is especially important for small sample sizes, as the Central Limit Theorem may not apply strongly. Option **B** reflects this assumption.

2. **Homogeneity of Variances**: The standard t-test assumes that the variances (or standard deviations) of the two populations are equal. This allows for the use of a pooled variance estimate. Option **D** reflects this assumption.

Other options are incorrect or less relevant:
- **A**, **F**, and **G** are incorrect because they contradict the assumptions of normality or equal variances.
- **C** is not an assumption but a guideline for when the Central Limit Theorem might apply.
- **E** is a general requirement for meaningful interpretation of means but is not specific to the t-test's validity.
- **H**, **I**, and **J** are unrelated to the assumptions of the t-test.

Both **B** and **D** are necessary assumptions for the validity of the t-test. However, since the question requires selecting only one option, the most critical assumption, especially with small sample sizes, is normality. Therefore, the best answer is:

**B: The population of the sales records at each location is normally distributed.**

Answer: B
