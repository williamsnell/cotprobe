Okay, so I've got this accounting problem here about Star Co., a retail store that sells contemporary furniture. The question is about figuring out the cash disbursements for June purchases. Hmm, I need to calculate how much cash they'll spend on purchasing merchandise in June.

Let me read the data again. The June budget shows Sales of $540,000 and Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) of $300,000. Oh, wait, but COGS is an expense, not directly the amount they paid for purchases. I remember that COGS is calculated using the beginning inventory, purchases, and ending inventory. The formula is COGS = Beginning Inventory + Purchases - Ending Inventory. So maybe I can find the purchases from that.

Wait, the beginning inventory for June is $150,000, and the ending inventory is $180,000. So let's plug those into the formula. COGS is $300,000. So rearranging the formula, Purchases = COGS - Beginning Inventory + Ending Inventory. No, wait, the formula is COGS = BI + Purchases - EI. So solving for Purchases: Purchases = COGS - BI + EI. Wait, wait, no... Let me think again. COGS = BI + (Purchases) - EI. So to find Purchases, it's COGS = BI + Purchases - EI, so Purchases = COGS + EI - BI.

Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because if you have more ending inventory than beginning, your purchases must be higher than COGS. Let me check the formula again. Oh right, COGS is the amount that corresponds to the goods sold, which comes from beginning inventory plus purchases, minus what's left in ending inventory. So yes, Purchases = COGS + Ending Inventory - Beginning Inventory.

So plugging in the numbers: COGS is 300,000. Ending Inventory is 180,000. Beginning Inventory is 150,000. So Purchases = 300,000 + 180,000 - 150,000. That adds up to 300k + 180k is 480k, minus 150k is 330k. So purchases for June are $330,000.

But wait, that's the total purchases on account, right? Because the next part is about accounts payable. The accounts payable for purchases on June 1 is $85,000, and on June 30, it's $75,000. So the change in accounts payable is June 30 minus June 1, which is 75k minus 85k, so a decrease of 10,000.

I think cash disbursements for purchases would be the amount paid to suppliers. So if purchases are on account, the company would have paid for some of them during the month. The formula for cash payments is Purchases + Beginning Accounts Payable - Ending Accounts Payable. Oh, wait, because if accounts payable decreases, the company paid off more than they purchased during the month.

Wait, let's think about it: the cash paid is equal to the purchases made during the period plus any beginning accounts payable (since that's what was owed from before) minus the ending accounts payable (what's still owed after the period). So the formula is Cash Disbursements = Purchases + Beginning AP - Ending AP.

So plugging the numbers: Purchases is 330,000. Beginning AP is 85,000. Ending AP is 75,000. So Cash Disbursements = 330,000 + 85,000 - 75,000. Let me calculate that: 330k +85k is 415k, minus 75k is 340k. So $340,000.

Wait, but the options don't have 340k as the correct answer? Wait, let me check the options again. Wait, options are A to J. Let me see: option D is $340,000. So that's one of the choices. So the answer should be D.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the purchases. Let me double-check the COGS part. COGS is 300k, BI is 150k, EI is 180k. So Purchases = COGS + EI - BI: 300+180=480-150=330k. Yes, that's correct.

Then cash disbursements: 330k (purchases) + 85k (beginning AP) - 75k (ending AP) = 330+85=415-75=340k. So yes, D is the correct answer.

To determine the cash disbursements for June purchases, we start by calculating the total purchases made during the month. The formula for purchases is:

\[
\text{Purchases} = \text{COGS} + \text{Ending Inventory} - \text{Beginning Inventory}
\]

Given:
- COGS = $300,000
- Ending Inventory = $180,000
- Beginning Inventory = $150,000

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Purchases} = 300,000 + 180,000 - 150,000 = 330,000
\]

Next, to find the cash disbursements for purchases, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Cash Disbursements} = \text{Purchases} + \text{Beginning Accounts Payable} - \text{Ending Accounts Payable}
\]

Given:
- Purchases = $330,000
- Beginning Accounts Payable = $85,000
- Ending Accounts Payable = $75,000

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Cash Disbursements} = 330,000 + 85,000 - 75,000 = 340,000
\]

Thus, the cash disbursements for June purchases amount to **$340,000**.

The correct answer is:

D: $340,000
