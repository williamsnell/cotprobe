Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's read it again carefully.

The question says that a parallel beam of light with a radiant energy density of 6.4 × 10^4 J/m³ is incident on a plane mirror. They're asking for two things: a) the momentum acting upon the mirror and b) the force exerted during 5 seconds of illumination. The options are from A to J.

Hmm. I remember that when light hits a mirror, it exerts a force because the photons carry momentum. I think the key here is to relate the energy density of the light to its momentum and then find the force.

Wait, so radiant energy density is the energy per unit volume that the light has. But I'm a bit fuzzy on exactly how to get from that to momentum. I recall that the momentum p of a photon is related to its energy E by p = E/c, where c is the speed of light. Oh wait, but that's for a single photon. Since we're dealing with a beam, maybe we need to consider the total energy and how that translates into momentum.

Right, the energy density here is given as 6.4e4 J/m³. So, energy per unit volume. If the light is moving in a particular direction, the momentum density would be energy per (volume * c), because p = E/c. So the momentum per unit volume is (6.4e4 J/m³) / c.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. The energy of a photon is E = h f, and the momentum p = h f / c = E/c. So each photon's momentum is E/c. So for a given energy, the total momentum should be the energy divided by c times the number of photons. But since the energy density is given, maybe we can find the total energy in a certain volume and then find the momentum.

Alternatively, I've heard that the momentum of light can be considered as p = U/c, where U is the energy density. Or wait, actually, when light is incident on a surface, the momentum transfer depends on whether it's being absorbed or reflected. If it's a mirror, the light is reflected, so the momentum change is twice that of the incoming light.

Wait, right! When a photon hits a mirror and reflects, its direction reverses, so the change in momentum is 2p. So the momentum transferred to the mirror is twice the momentum of the incoming light.

So, for part a), we're to find the momentum acting upon the mirror. But wait, the problem states that the beam is incident—so I think we have to consider the momentum per unit time or something else. Hmm, no, the question is asking for the momentum acting upon the mirror, which I think refers to the total momentum change during the time the light is on. Or wait, maybe it's the momentum per second, but no, part a) is just the momentum, part b) is the force over 5 seconds.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's clarify:

The problem says: a) the momentum acting upon the mirror. I think that would be the total momentum delivered to the mirror. Since the light is illuminating it for 5 seconds, the total momentum would be impulse, which is force multiplied by time. But wait, part a) is asking for momentum, part b) for force. Alternatively, maybe part a) is the momentum per second, but that would be the same as the force.

Wait, no. Momentum is impulse, which is force multiplied by time. So for part a), perhaps they're asking for the total momentum transferred during the 5 seconds, which would be the impulse. Or maybe a) is the instantaneous momentum, but I think in context, since they're giving a time, part a) is the impulse, which is F*t.

But I'm a bit confused. Let me think about the terms. The problem says: a) the momentum acting upon the mirror. Hmm. Momentum is a property of moving objects, so the total momentum transferred would be the impulse. So I think part a) is the total change in momentum, which is the impulse, equal to the average force multiplied by time.

But perhaps I should approach this step by step.

First, the energy density U is given as 6.4e4 J/m³.

I think the beam is a parallel beam, which probably means it's a plane wave, and perhaps we can assume the area is such that the volume is being considered. Wait, but without knowing the area or the volume, it's unclear. Hmm. Wait, maybe the beam's power is related.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the power. Power is energy per unit time (P = dE/dt). But the problem gives energy density, which is energy per unit volume.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. The beam has energy density U = 6.4e4 J/m³. Let's think about the energy passing through a certain area per second. Because the speed of light is c, the energy per unit area per unit time (power per area) is U * c. Because, think of it as energy per volume times speed (volume per second) gives energy per area per second.

Wait, that makes sense. So the power per unit area (intensity) I is U * c. So I = U c = 6.4e4 J/m³ * 3e8 m/s = 1.92e13 W/m². But wait, that's an extremely high intensity. Wait, 6.4e4 times 3e8 is 1.92e13, yes. But that seems way too high—normal laser intensities are much lower. But maybe the problem is just using these numbers.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let me think again. Energy density U is in J/m³. The energy passing through a unit area per unit time is I = U * c. Yes, because in one second, a volume of c * 1 m² (since c is m/s) would pass through, so energy is U * (c * 1 m² * 1 s) ) / m³ → U*c* (m² s) / m³ → U c (J/m). Wait, no, that's not right. Let me correct.

Wait, think about the units: U is J/m³. If we have a beam with area A m², then in time dt, the volume of the beam passing through is A * c * dt (since length is c*dt). So the energy in that volume is U * A c dt. So power P = dE/dt = U A c.

So the intensity I is P/A = U c. So I = U c.

So yes, I = U c. So the intensity is 6.4e4 * 3e8 = 1.92e13 W/m². That's a very high intensity, but perhaps it's correct for the problem.

Now, the momentum carried by the light. The momentum p of a photon is E/c. So for the beam, the momentum per second (which would be the force) would be (I * A) / c * 2. Wait, why 2? Because when light reflects off a mirror, each photon's momentum changes by 2p. So the change in momentum per photon is 2p. So the total force is the rate of momentum transfer.

Wait, but perhaps I should approach it more carefully.

The power P is energy per unit time (dE/dt). The momentum of light is p = E/c. So the momentum per unit time is P/(c) = dE/dt / c = (dE/dt) * (1/c). But wait, actually, when the light is reflected, the momentum change is 2p per photon. So each photon contributes 2p = 2E/c. Therefore, the total force F is the rate of change of momentum, which is 2P/(c).

Wait, because for each photon, the change is 2p, so per unit time, the force is 2 (P/c), because P is dE/dt, and each E gives a p of E/c, so 2P/(c) would be the force.

Wait, let me think again. The energy per unit time is P. Each unit of energy carries p = E/c. But upon reflection, the momentum imparted to the mirror is 2p, because the photon's direction reverses, so the change is 2p.

So, for each second, the energy is P, and the total momentum delivered is (P * 2 ) / c.

So F = 2 P / c.

But P is equal to U c A, as found earlier. So substituting:

F = 2 (U c A) / c = 2 U A.

Wait, that simplifies to F = 2 U A. So the force is twice the energy density times area.

Wait, but wait, what's A here? Because in the problem, they don't specify the area. Hmm. Oh, wait, perhaps the question is considering it per unit area? Or maybe the energy density is for a unit volume, and the beam's cross-section is 1 m²? I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the energy density is given, and the beam is a parallel beam, so perhaps we can model it as a certain volume. But without knowing the area, I'm stuck. Wait, maybe the question is considering the momentum per unit area or something like that. Hmm.

Wait, another approach. Since the beam is parallel, perhaps we can think in terms of flux. The energy density is U, and the speed of propagation is c, so the energy flow per unit area (intensity) is U c. So I = U c.

The momentum per photon is p = E/c. For N photons, the total momentum is N p = (N E)/c. But the energy is U times volume. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps for part a), the momentum acting on the mirror is the total momentum delivered during the time t, which would be the impulse. Since impulse is F * t, and F is 2 I / c, where I is the intensity. So F = 2 I / c.

Then, the impulse J (momentum) is F * t = (2 I / c) * t.

But I is U c, so substituting:

J = (2 (U c) / c ) * t = 2 U t.

Wait, but wait, J would be 2 U t. So, in this case, a) is the momentum, which would be 2 U t.

Wait, but what's U? U is energy density (J/m³). Hmm. But in our equation, J is 2 U t, but U is J/m³. That would give units of J s/m³, which isn't kg m/s. That doesn't make sense. So I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the expression for F. Let's go back.

The correct formula for the force exerted by light on a surface is F = (2 I) / c, where I is the intensity. Because each photon's momentum is p = E/c, and upon reflection, it's 2p, so the rate of momentum transfer is 2 (I) / c.

But I is in W/m² (Watts per square meter), which is J/(s m²). So F would be (2 J/(s m²)) / (m/s) ) → (2 J/(s m²)) * s/m → 2 J/(m³). Hmm, that doesn't give units of force (which is N = kg m/s²). So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of energy density U. Since I = U c, then F = 2 I / c = 2 U c / c = 2 U.

So F = 2 U. But U is J/m³. Force is N, which is kg m/s². So again, the units don't match. So I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the relationship between energy density and momentum density. The momentum density (momentum per unit volume) would be p_vol = U / c. Because for each photon, p = E/c, and U is energy per volume.

So p_vol = U / c. Then, when the light is reflected, the momentum change is 2 p_vol.

So the force, which is the rate of change of momentum, would be 2 p_vol times the volume flow rate.

Wait, the volume flow rate is area times speed. So for a given area A, the volume per second is A * c.

So F = 2 (U / c) * (A c) ) → F = 2 U A.

Wait, so F = 2 U A. So the force depends on the area A of the beam. But the problem doesn't give us the area. So I'm stuck again.

Hmm. Maybe the problem is assuming that the entire energy density is being used, but without knowing the area, we can't find a numerical value. So perhaps I'm missing something else.

Wait, perhaps the problem is considering the beam's power per unit area, but the question doesn't specify that. Alternatively, maybe the beam is considered to have unit area, but that's an assumption.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of energy. The energy in the beam is U times volume. Let's say the beam is of area A and during time t, the length l of the beam that passes is c t. So the volume is A c t. So the total energy E is U * A c t.

Now, the momentum per photon is E/c. So the total momentum without reflection would be E/c. But upon reflection, it's 2 E/c. So the total momentum delivered is 2 E/(c).

Substituting E = U A c t, so 2 (U A c t) / c = 2 U A t.

So the total momentum is 2 U A t. Now, the force is the rate of change of momentum, which is 2 U A.

Wait, but again, without knowing A, the area, we can't compute a numerical value. So I must be misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the question is considering the energy density as the energy per unit volume, and the beam is a plane wave, so the area is 1 m². But that's an assumption. Alternatively, perhaps they're using a different approach.

Alternatively, I remember that the radiation pressure (force per unit area) is given by P = U / c. But wait, no, that's for the momentum transfer when the light is absorbed. When reflected, it's 2 U / c. So the radiation pressure is F/A = 2 U / c.

Wait, that sounds more promising.

So the radiation pressure P is force per unit area, F/A = 2 U / c.

So if that's the case, then for part a), the momentum would be related to the impulse, which is F * t.

Wait, but again, without knowing the area, how can we compute F?

Wait, maybe the problem is giving U as energy density, and perhaps the beam is considered as a unit volume. But that doesn't make much sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the entire beam's energy, but without knowing the area or time, it's impossible. Unless I'm misinterpreting the question.

Wait, looking back: the problem is part a) the momentum acting upon the mirror, and part b) the force during 5 seconds.

Hmm. Maybe part a) is asking for the momentum per second, which would be the force. But that doesn't make sense because a) is about momentum, which is kg m/s, and b) is force, which is N.

Wait, perhaps part a) is the total momentum transferred during the 5 seconds, which would be impulse, which is F * t. So if I can find F, then a) is F * t, and b) is F.

So first, find F.

So F = 2 U A.

But without A, how can we proceed? Unless the beam is considered to have a certain area. Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that the beam is a point, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, perhaps the problem is using the relation that the momentum delivered per second (force) is 2 U c. Wait, let's think about units.

U is J/m³. c is m/s. So 2 U c is (J/m³)(m/s) ) = J/(m² s). Hmm, which is W/m², which is intensity. So that can't be the force.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the relation between energy density, momentum, and force.

Let me try a different approach. The momentum of light is p = E/c. The rate of energy delivery is P = dE/dt. So the rate of momentum delivery (force) is d(p)/dt = (dE/dt)/c = P / c.

But when the light is reflected, the momentum change is twice that, so F = 2 P / c.

So F = 2 (dE/dt) / c.

But dE/dt is power, which is I * A, where I is intensity, and A is area.

But without knowing A, I can't find F. Hmm.

Wait, but the problem gives the energy density U, not intensity. So perhaps I can relate U to P.

Wait, the intensity I is equal to U c. So U = I/(c).

So substituting into F = 2 (I A) / c.

But I is U c, so F = 2 (U c A)/c = 2 U A.

Again, same problem.

Wait, but perhaps there's another way. If the beam is a parallel beam, perhaps the area is such that the product U A is equal to the power divided by c. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is treating the energy density as the energy per unit time per unit area, but that's not right because energy density is per unit volume.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's see the options given. The options are for momentum and force, and they involve numbers like 1e-4, etc. So perhaps we can compute using the given U and time.

Wait, the only given time is 5 seconds, which is part of part b). So perhaps part a) is the momentum per second, meaning force, but that can't be because part a) is asking for momentum.

Wait, perhaps part a) is the momentum transferred, which would be F * t.

Wait, but without knowing F, I can't compute that yet.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the energy density U as the energy per unit area, not per volume, but that would be intensity, which is different.

Wait, perhaps the beam is considered to have a cross-sectional area of 1 m². That would make the calculations easier, but I'm not sure if that's a valid assumption.

Assuming A = 1 m², then F = 2 U A = 2 * 6.4e4
