Okay, so I've got this question about the Vedas, which are ancient Indian texts. The question is asking about three names: Ghosa, Apala, and Lopamurda. I remember that the Vedas are the oldest layer of Sanskrit literature and are considered sacred in Hinduism.

The question gives options about what these women are known for. The options are female dancers, poets, goddesses, rulers, artisans, physicians, princesses, saints, or warriors. I need to figure out which category these names fall into.

I think the Vedas include hymns and other compositions. I've heard that some women contributed to the Vedas. Maybe these names are of women who composed some of the hymns. So perhaps they are female poets? That would make sense because the Vedas are full of verses and hymns, and some were composed by rishikas, which are female sages or poets.

Wait, what else could they be? Maybe they're goddesses, but I don't recall specific names like Ghosa or Apala as major deities. Lopamudra rings a bell as a name, but I'm not sure if she's a goddess or a sage. I think she was a woman who contributed to Vedic literature, so that would align with being a poet.

Looking at the options, option B is female poets. That seems to fit because they are mentioned in the early Vedas as contributing to the hymns. So I'm leaning towards B as the correct answer.
