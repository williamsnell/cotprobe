Okay, so I've got this problem about minimizing the cost of a cylindrical container. Hmm, let's see. The container's volume is fixed at 10 cubic feet. The top and bottom are made of a material that costs $2 per square foot, and the side is cheaper at $1.50 per square foot. I need to find the dimensions (radius and height) that minimize the total cost.

Alright, I remember from calculus that optimization problems like this often involve taking derivatives and finding minima. So first, I should probably set up the problem with the right equations.

Let me start by recalling the formulas for the volume and surface areas of a cylinder. The volume V is πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height. The surface area for the top and bottom is 2πr² because each has an area of πr². The lateral surface area (the side) is 2πrh.

The costs are different for the top/bottom and the side. So the total cost C will be the sum of the cost for the top and bottom plus the cost for the side. Let me write that as:

C = (Cost per sq ft for top/bottom) * (Area of top and bottom) + (Cost per sq ft for side) * (Area of side)

Plugging in the numbers, that's:

C = 2 * (2πr²) + 1.5 * (2πrh)

Wait, wait. Wait, no. Wait, actually, no. Wait, the top and bottom each have an area of πr², so together that's 2πr². The side is 2πrh. So the cost for top/bottom is 2 * (2πr²)? No, wait no. Let me think again. Oh wait, no. The cost per square foot is $2 for top and bottom. So the area is 2πr², so the cost is 2 * (2πr²)? No, wait, no. Wait, no. No, the cost is 2 dollars per square foot times the area. So the area is 2πr², so cost is 2*(2πr²)? Wait, no! No, wait. No, the area is 2πr², and each square foot costs $2, so the cost is 2 * (2πr²)? Wait no, no. Wait, the cost is 2 per square foot. So for the top and bottom, the total area is 2πr², so the cost is 2 * (2πr²) ? No, wait, that's not right. Let me correct this.

Wait, no. No. The cost for top and bottom is 2 (dollars/sq ft) multiplied by their total area, which is 2πr². So that's 2*(2πr²) = 4πr²? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait, the cost is 2 per square foot. So each square foot of top and bottom costs $2. So the total cost for top and bottom is 2 * (2πr²) ? No, wait, no. Wait, the area is 2πr², so the cost is 2 * (2πr²) = 4πr²? Wait, no, that's not correct. Let's think again. If each square foot costs $2, then the cost is 2 * (area). The area is 2πr², so 2 * 2πr² = 4πr². Okay, so that's correct.

Then the side's cost is 1.5 per square foot, and the area is 2πrh, so the cost is 1.5 * 2πrh = 3πrh.

So total cost C = 4πr² + 3πrh.

But wait, the volume is fixed at 10 cubic feet. So V = πr²h = 10. So I can express h in terms of r, perhaps. Let me solve for h: h = 10/(πr²).

Substituting this into the cost equation, to express C in terms of r only.

So C = 4πr² + 3πr*(10/(πr²)).

Simplify that. Let's compute each term.

The first term is 4πr².

The second term: 3πr*(10/(πr²)) = (3πr * 10) / (πr²) ) = (30πr) / (πr²) ) → The π cancels, r cancels one power from denominator, so 30/(r).

So C = 4πr² + 30/(r).

Now, to find the minimum cost, I need to take the derivative of C with respect to r, set it to zero, and solve for r.

Compute dC/dr: 

dC/dr = d/dr [4πr² + 30 r^(-1) ]

Which is 8πr - 30 r^(-2) → 8πr - 30/(r²).

Set this equal to zero:

8πr - 30/(r²) = 0.

Let me move terms around:

8πr = 30/(r²)

Multiply both sides by r²:

8πr^3 = 30.

Then, r^3 = 30/(8π) → r^3 = (15)/(4π).

So r = cube root of (15/(4π)).

Let me compute that. Let's see, 15 divided by 4 is 3.75. So 3.75 divided by π is approximately 3.75/3.1416 ≈ 1.1938. So r ≈ cube root of 1.1938. Let me compute cube root of 1.1938. I know that 1^3 is 1, 1.05^3 is about 1.1576, 1.06^3 is about 1.1910. Wait, 1.06^3: 1.06 *1.06 = 1.1236, then *1.06 is about 1.1236 *1.06 ≈ 1.191. So 1.06^3 ≈ 1.191, which is close to 1.1938. So r ≈ 1.06 feet.

So r ≈ 1.061 feet, which is one of the options. Let me check the options. Option A says radius is approximately 1.061 feet, height is 2.828 feet. Let me compute h using r ≈1.061.

h = 10/(πr²). Let's compute r^2: (1.061)^2 ≈ 1.125. So π*1.125 ≈ 3.534. So 10/3.534 ≈ 2.828 feet. So that's option A.

Wait, but I should also check if this is a minimum. I can do the second derivative test. Compute the second derivative of C with respect to r:

d²C/dr² = 8π + 60/(r^3). Since r is positive, the second derivative is positive, which means the function is concave upward here, so it's a minimum.

So the correct dimensions are r ≈1.061 feet and h ≈2.828 feet, which is option A.

Looking at the options, option A is exactly that. So the answer should be A.

To minimize the total cost of the cylindrical container, we start by defining the cost function. The total cost \( C \) includes the cost of the top and bottom (at \$2 per square foot) and the cost of the side (at \$1.50 per square foot). The volume of the cylinder is fixed at 10 cubic feet, which gives the constraint \( V = \pi r^2 h = 10 \).

### Step 1: Express the cost in terms of \( r \) and \( h \)
- The area of the top and bottom is \( 2\pi r^2 \), so their cost is \( 2 \cdot (2\pi r^2) = 4\pi r^2 \).
- The area of the side is \( 2\pi r h \), so its cost is \( 1.5 \cdot (2\pi r h) = 3\pi r h \).
- The total cost is:
  \[
  C = 4\pi r^2 + 3\pi r h
  \]

### Step 2: Use the volume constraint to express \( h \) in terms of \( r \)
From \( \pi r^2 h = 10 \), we solve for \( h \):
\[
h = \frac{10}{\pi r^2}
\]

Substitute \( h \) into the cost function:
\[
C = 4\pi r^2 + 3\pi r \cdot \frac{10}{\pi r^2}
\]
Simplify:
\[
C = 4\pi r^2 + \frac{30}{r}
\]

### Step 3: Find the minimum cost by taking the derivative of \( C \) with respect to \( r \)
Take the derivative of \( C \) with respect to \( r \):
\[
\frac{dC}{dr} = 8\pi r - \frac{30}{r^2}
\]

Set \( \frac{dC}{dr} = 0 \) to find the critical points:
\[
8\pi r - \frac{30}{r^2} = 0
\]
\[
8\pi r = \frac{30}{r^2}
\]
Multiply through by \( r^2 \):
\[
8\pi r^3 = 30
\]
Solve for \( r \):
\[
r^3 = \frac{30}{8\pi} = \frac{15}{4\pi}
\]
\[
r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{15}{4\pi}}
\]

Approximating \( \pi \approx 3.1416 \):
\[
r = \sqrt[3]{\frac{15}{4 \cdot 3.1416}} = \sqrt[3]{\frac{15}{12.5664}} = \sqrt[3]{1.1938} \approx 1.061 \, \text{feet}
\]

### Step 4: Find \( h \) using the value of \( r \)
Substitute \( r \approx 1.061 \) into \( h = \frac{10}{\pi r^2} \):
\[
r^2 \approx (1.061)^2 \approx 1.125
\]
\[
h = \frac{10}{\pi \cdot 1.125} = \frac{10}{3.534} \approx 2.828 \, \text{feet}
\]

### Step 5: Verify that this is a minimum
The second derivative of \( C \) with respect to \( r \) is:
\[
\frac{d^2C}{dr^2} = 8\pi + \frac{60}{r^3}
\]
Since \( r > 0 \), \( \frac{d^2C}{dr^2} > 0 \), confirming that the function is concave upward and this critical point corresponds to a minimum.

### Final Answer
The dimensions that minimize the total cost are:
- Radius \( r \approx 1.061 \, \text{feet} \)
- Height \( h \approx 2.828 \, \text{feet} \)

This matches **Option A**.
