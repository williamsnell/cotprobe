Okay, so I have this question about calculating the beta of a stock. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I remember that beta is a measure of a stock's volatility in relation to the market. Let me think about the formula. 

I think beta is calculated using the covariance between the stock and the market, divided by the variance of the market index. Or wait, was it the covariance divided by the standard deviation squared? Oh right, variance is the square of the standard deviation, so beta equals covariance divided by the market's variance.

So the question gives me the covariance as 88. The standard deviations are 19% for Stock A and 14% for the market index. Wait, but for beta, the denominator is the variance of the market, which is (market's standard deviation squared). So I need to square the 14% to get the variance.

Let me calculate that. 14% is 0.14. Squaring that gives 0.14 * 0.14 = 0.0196. So the market variance is 0.0196.

Now, the covariance is 88, so beta is 88 divided by 0.0196. Let me compute that. 88 divided by 0.0196. Let me do the division. Hmm, 0.0196 times 4 is about 0.0784, so 88 / 0.0196 = let me see, 88 / 0.0196 = around 4496? Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, wait a second. Maybe I'm getting the units wrong. Oh wait, the covariance is given in percentage terms, or are those standard deviations percentages? Wait, the standard deviations are percentages, but covariance is in (percentage squared) terms. 

Wait, no, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me clarify. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. So if the market's standard deviation is 14%, its variance is (0.14)^2 = 0.0196, which is in (percentage squared) terms. Similarly, covariance is given as 88, but I'm not sure if that's in percentage squared or decimal. Oh wait, the problem states that the covariance is 88, and the standard deviations are 19% and 14%. So probably, 88 is in decimal terms, but the standard deviations are percentages. That is, 19% is 0.19, and 14% is 0.14.

Wait, no. Wait, if the standard deviations are 19% and 14%, that's 0.19 and 0.14. But the covariance is 88, which is a number without the percent sign. So perhaps the units are consistent as decimals. So covariance is 88 (unit-less, or in decimal terms), market standard deviation is 0.14.

So beta is covariance divided by (market std dev squared). So 88 / (0.14^2). Let me compute 0.14 squared. 0.14 * 0.14 = 0.0196. So 88 / 0.0196. Let me compute that. 

Let me think: 88 divided by 0.0196. Let me see, 0.0196 times 4 is 0.0784. 0.0196 times 4500 is 0.0196 * 4500 = let's see, 0.02 *4500 is 90, so subtract 0.0004 *4500=1.8, so 88.2. Oh wait, 0.0196 * 4500 = 88.2. But 88 is slightly less than 88.2, so 4500 times 0.0196 is 88.2, so 88 / 0.0196 is slightly less than 4500. Wait, that can't be right because beta is usually a number around 1, maybe higher or lower, but 4500 is way too high. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe I mixed up the units. Oh wait, perhaps the covariance is in percentages as well. So 88%? Or maybe the standard deviations are given in percentages, and the covariance is in the same percentage terms. So if covariance is 88, and the standard deviations are 19 and 14, then perhaps we need to calculate beta as covariance divided by (market std dev squared), but all in percentage terms.

Wait, but units matter. Let's think: covariance is measured in the product of the standard deviations. So Cov(A, M) = β * σ_M^2. So β = Cov(A, M) / (σ_M^2).

If the covariance is 88, and σ_M is 14% (0.14), then σ_M squared is 0.14^2 = 0.0196.

So β = 88 / 0.0196 = let me compute that. 0.0196 is approximately 0.02. 88 / 0.02 is 4400. But wait, that's a beta of 4400? That can't be right. Beta is usually around 1 for the market. So I must have messed up the units somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the covariance is given as 88 in decimal terms, but the standard deviations are percentages. That would make the units inconsistent. Because covariance is in (units of A and units of M). If A is in % and M is in %, then covariance is in %^2. Hmm, but then if I'm using standard deviations in %, then when I compute beta, I have Cov(A,M) in %^2 divided by (σ_M^2 in %^2), which would make beta unitless, as it should be.

So let's try that again. Cov(A,M)=88%, which would be 0.88 in decimal? Or wait, maybe the 88 is in decimal. I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the standard deviations are in decimals, so 19% is 0.19, 14% is 0.14. Then covariance is 88 * (0.01)^2, because percentages. So 0.88 * 0.0001 = 0.000088. Hmm, that seems too small.

Wait, maybe I should just proceed with the numbers as given. Let's take the covariance as 88, and the standard deviations as 19 and 14.

Wait, but in the formula for beta, only the market's standard deviation is used. So:

β = Cov(A, M) / (σ_M^2)

Given:
Cov(A, M) = 88
σ_M = 14 → σ_M^2 = 14^2 = 196

So β = 88 / 196 = let me compute that. 88 divided by 196. Well, 196 × 0.45 is 88.2. Oh wait, 0.45 *196= 88.2. So 88 is approximately 0.449, which is about 0.45. So beta is approximately 0.45.

Looking at the options, option J is 0.45. So the answer should be J.

Wait, but wait a second. If the standard deviations are in percentages, like 19% is 0.19, 14% is 0.14, then the calculation would be:

Cov(A,M) = 88 → but are these percentages? Let me think. If the covariance is 88, and σ_M is 0.14 (14%), then β is 88 / (0.14)^2 = 88 / 0.0196 ≈ 4494.89. That can't be right because beta is usually not that high. So perhaps the initial approach was correct when I treated the numbers as not percentages. So perhaps the standard deviations are 19 and 14 as absolute numbers, not percentages.

Wait, the question says their standard deviations are respectively 19% and 14%. So σ_A =19% (0.19), σ_M=14% (0.14). Then, the covariance is given as 88. Wait, but covariance would have units of (percentage^2), right? Because covariance is in the product of the standard deviations. So if the covariance is 88, that would be 88 (percentage squared), which is 88*(%)^2. So to convert that into decimal, 88*(0.01)^2 = 0.000088 (assuming that 88 is in percentage squared terms).

Wait, that would make the calculation as β = Cov(A,M) / (σ_M^2) = 0.000088 / (0.14^2) = 0.000088 / 0.0196 ≈ 0.00449. That's way too low, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps the original assumption was wrong, and the covariance is in decimal, not percentage.

Alternatively, perhaps the numbers are all in decimal. So Cov(A,M)=0.88, σ_M=0.14, so σ_M^2=0.0196. Then β = 0.88 / 0.0196 ≈ 44.9, which is way too high.

I'm getting really confused. Let me try to think differently. Maybe the units are in percentages, but the calculations are done in percentages, so that the beta is unitless.

So Cov(A, M) is 88 (in %²), σ_M is 14% (so 14). Then σ_M squared is 14²=196 (%²). So β = 88 / 196 = 0.449, approximately 0.45, which matches option J.

Yes, this makes sense. Because when you compute covariance in %², and variance in %², the beta is unitless. So 88 / (14^2) = 88/196=0.449, which is approximately 0.45. So the correct answer is J: 0.45.

To calculate the beta of Stock A, we use the formula:

\[
\beta = \frac{\text{Cov}(A, M)}{\sigma_M^2}
\]

where:
- \(\text{Cov}(A, M)\) is the covariance between Stock A and the market index, given as 88.
- \(\sigma_M\) is the standard deviation of the market index, given as 14% (or 0.14 in decimal form).

### Step 1: Calculate \(\sigma_M^2\)
The variance of the market index is:

\[
\sigma_M^2 = (0.14)^2 = 0.0196
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \(\beta\)
Substitute the values into the formula:

\[
\beta = \frac{\text{Cov}(A, M)}{\sigma_M^2} = \frac{88}{0.0196}
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\beta \approx 4494.89
\]

This result is unreasonably high, suggesting a potential issue with the interpretation of units. Reassessing, if the covariance (88) and standard deviations (19% and 14%) are expressed in percentage terms, the units are consistent, and the calculation proceeds as follows:

\[
\sigma_M^2 = (14)^2 = 196 \quad \text{(in percentage squared)}
\]

\[
\beta = \frac{\text{Cov}(A, M)}{\sigma_M^2} = \frac{88}{196} \approx 0.449
\]

This simplifies to approximately:

\[
\beta \approx 0.45
\]

### Conclusion
The beta of Stock A is approximately 0.45, which corresponds to option **J**.
