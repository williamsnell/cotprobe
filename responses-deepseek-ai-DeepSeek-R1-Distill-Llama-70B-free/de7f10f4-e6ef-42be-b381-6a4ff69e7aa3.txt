Okay, so I've got this problem about heat loss in a pipe. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through step by step. Alright, the question is about a stainless steel pipe with certain dimensions, covered with insulation, and we need to find the rate of heat loss per foot of the pipe.

The pipe has an inside diameter of 3 inches and an outside diameter of 3.5 inches. Oh wait, so I guess the wall thickness is the difference in radius, right? Because radius is half of diameter. So the inside radius r1 is 1.5 inches, and the outside radius r2 is 1.75 inches. But wait, the insulation is 0.5 inches thick. So the outer radius of the insulation would be 1.75 + 0.5 = 2.25 inches? Because the insulation is over the pipe, so it adds to the radius.

The fluid inside the pipe is at 400°F, and the outside air is at 75°F. The conductivities are given: the pipe's k is 30 Btu/hr-ft-°F, and the insulation's k is 0.12 Btu/hr-ft-°F. Also, the inner and outer surface conductances (h) are 50 and 5 Btu/hr-ft²-°F, respectively.

Wait, I remember that for heat transfer through a cylinder, we have to consider both conduction through the pipe wall and the insulation, and convection at the surfaces. So the total heat transfer would be the sum of the resistances in series.

Oh right! The formula for heat loss per unit length (Q) is Q = (T_infinity1 - T_infinity2) / (R_total), where R_total is the sum of all thermal resistances.

So let me break it down into steps.

First, I think the process is:

1. Calculate the thermal resistances for each part: inside convection, conduction through the pipe, conduction through the insulation, and outside convection.

Wait a minute, no. Wait, the pipe is made of two layers: the metal (stainless steel) and the insulation (asbestos). So the conduction would be through the metal first, then through the insulation. Or wait, no. Wait, the pipe is metal, and then it's covered with insulation. So the heat flows from the fluid, through the inner convection (h_i), then conducts through the metal pipe (k_metal), then conducts through the insulation (k_insulation), and then through the outer convection (h_o). So the resistances are in series, and each has its own formula.

The formula for each resistance is as follows:

- For convection (inside and outside), R_conv = 1/(h*A), where A is the surface area. But wait, since this is per foot length, the area for the inner conv is 2*pi*r1*L, and for outer conv, 2*pi*r3*L, where r3 is the outer radius after insulation.

Wait, but since we're finding Q per foot, L is 1 ft. So maybe I can calculate each resistance per foot.

Alternatively, since Q is per foot, L is 1, so we can ignore it in the area terms, but I'm not sure.

Wait, the thermal resistance for convection is R_conv = 1/(h * A), where A is the area. For a cylinder, A = 2 * pi * r * L. Since L is 1, A = 2 pi r.

So for each step, the resistances are:

R1 (inside convection) = 1/(h1 * A1) = 1/(50 * 2 * pi * r1 * 1). Because h1 is 50, and A1 is 2 pi r1 * L. Since L is 1, it's 2 pi r1.

Similarly, R2 (conduction through pipe) is ln(r2 / r1) / (k_pipe * 2 * pi * L). Again, since L=1, it's ln(r2/r1)/(k_pipe * 2 pi).

Wait, no. The conduction resistance for a cylinder is R_cond = ln(ro/ri) / (2 pi k L). So when L is 1, it's ln(r2/r1)/(2 pi k_metal).

Then, R3 is the conduction through the insulation. So that's ln(r3/r2)/(2 pi k_insulation). Because the insulation is from r2 (pipe's outer radius) to r3 (insulation's outer radius). Oh wait, wait, the insulation is 0.5 inches thick. So r3 = r2 + insulation thickness. So r2 is 1.75 inches, and add 0.5 inches, so r3 = 2.25 inches.

Wait, but all these radii are in inches. Since the problem is in feet, I should convert inches to feet. Because 1 inch is 1/12 feet.

So let me convert all radii to feet:

r1 = 1.5 inches = 1.5 / 12 ft = 0.125 ft.

r2 = 1.75 inches = 1.75 / 12 ≈ 0.1458333 ft.

r3 = 2.25 inches = 2.25 / 12 = 0.1875 ft.

Now, let me compute each resistance.

R1: Inside convection resistance.

h1 = 50 Btu/hr-ft²-°F.

A1 = 2 * pi * r1 * 1 = 2 * pi * 0.125 = 0.25 pi ≈ 0.7854 ft².

So R1 = 1/(h1 * A1) = 1/(50 * 0.7854) ≈ 1/(39.27) ≈ 0.02546 hr-ft²/°F.

Wait, because R is in (hr·ft²·°F)/Btu, since the unit of h is Btu/(hr·ft²·°F). So 1/h would be (hr·ft²·°F)/Btu.

Wait, no, let me double-check the units. The resistance R has units of (°F·hr·ft²)/Btu. Because Q is Btu/hr, so Q = (T1 - T2)/R, so R must be (T·hr·ft²)/Btu.

Yes. So R1 is 1/(h1 * A1), so the units are (hr·ft²·°F)/Btu.

Wait, but let me not get stuck on that, since the calculation will come out in the right terms.

So R1 = 1/(50 * 0.7854) ≈ 0.02546 (hr·ft²·°F)/Btu.

R2: Conduction through the pipe.

k_pipe = 30 Btu/(hr·ft·°F).

The formula is ln(r2/r1)/(2 * pi * k_pipe * L). Since L=1, it's ln(r2/r1)/(2 pi k_pipe).

r2/r1 = (0.1458333)/(0.125) = 1.1666667.

So ln(1.1666667) ≈ 0.15415.

Thus, R2 = 0.15415 / (2 * pi * 30) ≈ 0.15415 / (188.4956) ≈ 0.000817 (hr·ft²·°F)/Btu.

R3: Conduction through insulation.

k_insulation = 0.12 Btu/(hr·ft·°F).

r3/r2 = 0.1875 / 0.1458333 = 1.2857143.

ln(1.2857143) ≈ 0.25132.

So R3 = 0.25132 / (2 * pi * 0.12) ≈ 0.25132 / (0.75398) ≈ 0.3333 (hr·ft²·°F)/Btu.

R4: Outside convection resistance.

h_o =5 Btu/(hr·ft²·°F).

A3 = 2 * pi * r3 * 1 = 2 * pi * 0.1875 ≈ 1.1781 ft².

R4 = 1/(h_o * A3) = 1/(5 * 1.1781) ≈ 1/(5.8905) ≈ 0.1697 (hr·ft²·°F)/Btu.

Now, sum all the resistances:

R_total = R1 + R2 + R3 + R4.

Let me compute each:

R1 ≈ 0.02546

R2 ≈ 0.000817

R3 ≈ 0.3333

R4 ≈ 0.1697

Adding them up:

0.02546 + 0.000817 ≈ 0.026277

0.026277 + 0.3333 ≈ 0.3596

0.3596 + 0.1697 ≈ 0.5293 (hr·ft²·°F)/Btu.

Wait, that can't be right. Because when I add R1, R2, R3, R4, I get 0.0255 + 0.0008= 0.0263; plus 0.3333 = 0.3596; plus 0.1697= 0.5293.

So R_total ≈ 0.5293 (hr·ft²·°F)/Btu.

The temperature difference is T_infinity1 - T_infinity2 = 400 -75 = 325 °F.

So Q = (T1 - T2) / R_total = 325 / 0.5293 ≈ 614.45 Btu/hr-ft.

Looking at the options, option I is 615 Btu/hr-ft. So that's the closest answer.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Let me recalculate each part.

First, R1: 1/(50 * 2 pi r1).

r1=0.125 ft.

So 2 pi r1 = 0.25 pi ≈ 0.7854 ft².

50 * 0.7854 ≈ 39.27.

1/39.27≈0.02546. That's correct.

R2: ln(1.75/12 / 1.5/12 )= ln(1.75/1.5) = ln(1.1666667)≈0.15415.

Divide by (2 pi *30) = 60 pi ≈ 188.4955.

0.15415 / 188.4955≈0.000817. Correct.

R3: r3=2.25/12=0.1875 ft.

r3/r2=0.1875/0.1458333≈1.285714. ln≈0.2513.

Denominator: 2 pi *0.12=0.24 pi≈0.75398.

0.2513/0.75398≈0.3333. Correct.

R4: 2 pi r3=2 pi *0.1875≈1.1781 ft².

h_o=5, so 5 *1.1781≈5.8905.

1/5.8905≈0.1697. Correct.

Sum R1+R2=0.02546+0.000817≈0.02628.

+R3=0.02628+0.3333≈0.3596.

+R4=0.3596+0.1697≈0.5293.

So Q=325 /0.5293≈614.45, which is about 615, so option I.

To determine the rate of heat loss per foot length of the pipe, we analyze the thermal resistances in series, which include convection at the inner surface, conduction through the pipe wall, conduction through the insulation, and convection at the outer surface. The formula for heat loss is:

\[
Q = \frac{T_{\text{in}} - T_{\text{out}}}{R_{\text{total}}}
\]

where \( R_{\text{total}} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + R_4 \), and each resistance is calculated as follows:

1. **Inner convection resistance (\( R_1 \))**:
   \[
   R_1 = \frac{1}{h_1 A_1}, \quad A_1 = 2 \pi r_1
   \]
   Substituting \( h_1 = 50 \, \text{Btu/hr-ft}^2\text{-°F} \) and \( r_1 = 0.125 \, \text{ft} \):
   \[
   R_1 = \frac{1}{50 \cdot 2 \pi \cdot 0.125} = \frac{1}{39.27} \approx 0.02546 \, \text{hr-ft}^2\text{-°F/Btu}.
   \]

2. **Conduction through the pipe wall (\( R_2 \))**:
   \[
   R_2 = \frac{\ln(r_2 / r_1)}{2 \pi k_{\text{pipe}}}
   \]
   Substituting \( r_2 = 0.1458333 \, \text{ft} \), \( r_1 = 0.125 \, \text{ft} \), and \( k_{\text{pipe}} = 30 \, \text{Btu/hr-ft-°F} \):
   \[
   R_2 = \frac{\ln(1.16667)}{2 \pi \cdot 30} = \frac{0.15415}{188.4956} \approx 0.000817 \, \text{hr-ft}^2\text{-°F/Btu}.
   \]

3. **Conduction through the insulation (\( R_3 \))**:
   \[
   R_3 = \frac{\ln(r_3 / r_2)}{2 \pi k_{\text{insulation}}}
   \]
   Substituting \( r_3 = 0.1875 \, \text{ft} \), \( r_2 = 0.1458333 \, \text{ft} \), and \( k_{\text{insulation}} = 0.12 \, \text{Btu/hr-ft-°F} \):
   \[
   R_3 = \frac{\ln(1.28571)}{2 \pi \cdot 0.12} = \frac{0.25132}{0.75398} \approx 0.3333 \, \text{hr-ft}^2\text{-°F/Btu}.
   \]

4. **Outer convection resistance (\( R_4 \))**:
   \[
   R_4 = \frac{1}{h_2 A_3}, \quad A_3 = 2 \pi r_3
   \]
   Substituting \( h_2 = 5 \, \text{Btu/hr-ft}^2\text{-°F} \) and \( r_3 = 0.1875 \, \text{ft} \):
   \[
   R_4 = \frac{1}{5 \cdot 2 \pi \cdot 0.1875} = \frac{1}{5.8905} \approx 0.1697 \, \text{hr-ft}^2\text{-°F/Btu}.
   \]

**Total resistance**:
\[
R_{\text{total}} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + R_4 = 0.02546 + 0.000817 + 0.3333 + 0.1697 \approx 0.5293 \, \text{hr-ft}^2\text{-°F/Btu}.
\]

**Heat loss per foot**:
\[
Q = \frac{T_{\text{in}} - T_{\text{out}}}{R_{\text{total}}} = \frac{400 - 75}{0.5293} \approx 614.45 \, \text{Btu/hr-ft}.
\]

The closest option is **615 Btu/hr-ft**, which corresponds to **option I**.
