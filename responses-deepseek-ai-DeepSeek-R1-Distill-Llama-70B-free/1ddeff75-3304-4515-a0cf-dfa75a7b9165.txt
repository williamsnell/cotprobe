Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about lenses and focal lengths. Hmm, I remember that the focal length of a lens depends on the refractive index of the surrounding medium. Let me think about this.

The question is asking for the ratio of the focal lengths of a glass lens in water compared to in air. The refractive indices are given as 1.5 for glass and 1.33 for water. I think I should use the lensmaker's equation here. Oh right, the lensmaker's formula relates the focal length to the refractive indices.

Wait, the lensmaker's equation is 1/f = (n₂ - n₁) * (1/R₁ - 1/R₂), right? Or wait, no, maybe I got that wrong. Let me get it straight. Oh yeah, the formula is 1/f = (n_rel - 1) * (1/R₁ - 1/R₂), where n_rel is the relative refractive index of the lens material compared to the surrounding medium.

So when the lens is in air, the surrounding medium is air, which has a refractive index of about 1. So n_rel for air would be 1.5 / 1 = 1.5. When the lens is submerged in water, the surrounding medium is water with n=1.33. So n_rel becomes 1.5 / 1.33.

Wait, but the formula uses n_rel minus 1. So for air, (1.5 - 1) = 0.5. For water, (1.5/1.33 - 1) would be (approx 1.125 -1)= 0.125. 

So the focal length f is inversely proportional to (n_rel -1). Because if that term is bigger, the focal length is smaller. So when the lens is in air, (n_rel -1) is 0.5, and in water, it's 0.125. 

So the ratio f_water / f_air would be (0.5) / (0.125) = 4. But wait, wait a second. Because 1/f is proportional to (n_rel -1), so f is inversely proportional. So f_water / f_air = (n_air -1)/(n_water -1). Wait no, let me think again. Because 1/f ∝ (n_rel -1), so f ∝ 1/(n_rel -1). 

So when in air, n_rel is 1.5. So (n_rel -1) is 0.5. So f_air is proportional to 1/0.5 = 2. When in water, n_rel is 1.5/1.33 ≈ 1.125. So (n_rel -1) is 0.125. So f_water is proportional to 1/0.125 = 8. 

So the ratio f_water : f_air is 8:2, which simplifies to 4:1. So f_water is four times f_air. Wait, but wait, the focal length in water would be longer because the lens is less converging when surrounded by a medium with higher refractive index. Because in water, the relative refractive index is lower, so the bending of light is less, so the focal length increases.

So the ratio is f_water / f_air = ( (n_air -1) ) / ( (n_water -1) )? Wait, maybe I should approach it more systematically.

Let's denote the lensmaker's equation in the two cases.

In air: 1/f_air = (n_glass - 1) * (1/R₁ - 1/R₂)
In water: 1/f_water = (n_glass - n_water) * (1/R₁ - 1/R₂) ?

Wait, no. Wait, the lensmaker's formula when the lens is surrounded by a medium other than air uses the relative refractive index. So the formula is 1/f = (n_rel - 1) * (1/R₁ - 1/R₂), where n_rel is n_lens / n_medium.

So in air, n_medium is 1, so n_rel is 1.5. So 1/f_air = (1.5 -1) * (1/R₁ - 1/R₂) → 0.5*(shape factor).

In water, n_medium is 1.33. So n_rel is 1.5 / 1.33 ≈ 1.125. So 1/f_water = (1.125 -1) * (shape factor) → 0.125*(shape factor).

So the shape factor (1/R₁ -1/R₂) is the same in both cases because it's the same lens. So let me denote the shape factor as K. So:

1/f_air = 0.5 * K → f_air = 2/(K)
1/f_water = 0.125 * K → f_water = 8/(K)

So the ratio f_water / f_air = (8/K) / (2/K) )= 8/2 =4.

Wait, but wait, the question asks for the ratio of focal lengths of the glass lens in water to that in air. So f_water / f_air =4. So the ratio is 4:1. Looking at the options, option E is 4.5, which isn't 4. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me recheck the calculations.

n_rel in air: 1.5, so (n_rel -1)=0.5.

n_rel in water: 1.5/1.33 ≈ 1.125, so (n_rel -1)=0.125.

So 1/f ∝ (n_rel -1) → f inversely proportional to (n_rel -1).

So f_air = 1/(0.5 K) = 2/K.

f_water = 1/(0.125 K) = 8/K.

Ratio f_water/f_air = (8/K)/(2/K)=4.

So 4. But let me look at the options. Option E is 4.5, which is 9/2. Option I is 3.91, which is about 4. So none of the options is exactly 4. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, maybe I should consider the sign in the lensmaker's equation, but I think that doesn't affect the ratio because the lens is the same (same shape, same R's) so the focal length would have the same sign in both cases. So the ratio should still be positive.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately 1.5/1.33.

Let me compute 1.5 /1.33 precisely.

1.33 is approximately 4/3 (since 4/3≈1.3333). So 1.5 is 3/2.

So (3/2) / (4/3) ) = (3/2)*(3/4) )= 9/8 =1.125. So yes, correct.

So 1.5/1.33=1.125 exactly as 9/8. So (n_rel -1) is 1/8=0.125.

So the ratio of 1/f_air to 1/f_water is (0.5)/(0.125) =4.

Wait, 1/f_air / 1/f_water = (0.5 K) / (0.125 K) )=4 → f_water =4 * f_air.

Wait, no, wait. 1/f_air = 0.5 K → f_air = 2/(K).

1/f_water=0.125 K → f_water =8/(K).

So f_water =4 * f_air. So the ratio f_water/f_air is 4. So the answer should be 4.

But looking at the options, I don't see 4. So maybe I made a mistake in the approach. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: The focal length in a medium depends on the relative refractive index. So f = (n_rel -1)^-1 * (some constant). So f_water = f_air * ( (n_air -1)/(n_water -1) )

Wait no, because f_air is when surrounded by air, so n_air=1.

Wait, let me think in terms of relative refractive indices.

In air: relative index is 1.5. So (1.5 -1)=0.5.

In water: relative index is 1.5/1.33≈1.125. So (1.125-1)=0.125.

So the ratio is (0.5)/(0.125)=4. So f_water is 4 times f_air.

But the question is asking for the ratio of the focal lengths in water to air, so 4. Since the options don't have 4, maybe I did something wrong.

Wait, perhaps the lensmaker's formula is 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 -1/R2). So when the medium is not air, it's (n/n_medium -1).

Wait, no, the formula is 1/f = (n_medium_surrounded / n_lens - 1) * ... Wait, no. I'm getting confused now. Let me check the correct formula.

Wait, the correct lensmaker's equation when the lens is immersed in a medium with refractive index n_medium is:

1/f = ( (n_lens / n_medium ) - 1 ) * ( 1/R₁ - 1/R₂ )

Yes, that's correct.

So in air, n_medium =1, so (n_lens/1 -1 )=1.5-1=0.5.

In water, n_medium=1.33, so (1.5/1.33 -1 )= (1.5/1.33) is approximately 1.125, minus 1 is 0.125.

So 1/f_air = 0.5 * K, where K is (1/R1 -1/R2).

1/f_water=0.125 * K.

So f_air = 1/(0.5 K) = 2/K.

f_water=1/(0.125 K)=8/K.

So ratio f_water/f_air= (8/K)/(2/K)=4.

Hmm. So the ratio is 4, but none of the options is exactly 4. The options are:

A:2.5

B:0.89

C:2.23

D:2.75

E:4.5

F:0.75

G:1.11

H:1.5

I:3.91

J:1.33

Wait, option I is 3.91, which is approximately 4. But not exactly. Did I compute 1.5/1.33 correctly?

Wait, 1.5 /1.33 is approximately 1.125, but exact value is 1.5 ÷ (4/3) )= (3/2) * (3/4)=9/8=1.125.

So 1.125-1=0.125. So 0.5 /0.125=4. So the ratio is 4.

Hmm, perhaps the question is asking for the inverse? Like f_air/f_water? No, the question says "ratio of the focal lengths of a glass lens in water and in air", which is f_water / f_air.

But none of the options is 4. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait another thought: Maybe I should consider the lens formula differently. Like, focal length in medium m is given by f_m = f_air * ( (n_m -1)/(n_glass -n_m) )? No, I think that's not correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the lensmaker's equation when in medium m is:

1/f_m = (n_glass - n_m) * (1/R1 - 1/R2) / n_m.

Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me look up the lensmaker's equation for a lens in a medium.

Wait (pretending to recall), the correct formula is 1/f = (n_lens/n_medium - 1) * (1/R1 - 1/R2).

So that's what I used earlier.

So 1/f_air = (1.5/1 -1) * K = 0.5 K.

1/f_water = (1.5/1.33 -1) * K ≈ (1.125 -1) K =0.125 K.

So f_air = 2/(K), f_water=8/(K). Ratio f_water/f_air=4.

Hmm. So either the options are wrong or I made a mistake. But wait, let me check the options again. Oh, option E is 4.5, which is larger than 4. So perhaps I made a calculation error.

Wait, perhaps 1.5 divided by 1.33 is not exactly 1.125. Let me compute it more accurately.

1.33 is 133/100, so 1.5 is 3/2. So 3/2 divided by 1.33 is 3/2 * 100/133 = (300)/(266) ≈ 1.128.

So 1.128 -1=0.128.

So 0.5 / 0.128 = approximately 3.906, which is about 3.91. Which is option I.

Ah, that must be it. So the correct ratio is approximately 3.91. So the answer is option I.

To determine the ratio of the focal lengths of a glass lens in water and in air, we use the lensmaker's equation. The focal length \( f \) of a lens depends on the relative refractive index of the lens material compared to the surrounding medium. The lensmaker's equation is:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = (n_{\text{rel}} - 1) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2}\right),
\]

where \( n_{\text{rel}} = \frac{n_{\text{lens}}}{n_{\text{medium}}} \). The term \( \left(\frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2}\right) \) is constant for a given lens.

### Step 1: Focal length in air
In air, the refractive index of the medium is \( n_{\text{medium}} = 1 \), so:
\[
n_{\text{rel, air}} = \frac{n_{\text{glass}}}{n_{\text{air}}} = \frac{1.5}{1} = 1.5.
\]
Thus:
\[
\frac{1}{f_{\text{air}}} = (1.5 - 1) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2}\right) = 0.5 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2}\right).
\]

### Step 2: Focal length in water
In water, the refractive index of the medium is \( n_{\text{medium}} = 1.33 \), so:
\[
n_{\text{rel, water}} = \frac{n_{\text{glass}}}{n_{\text{water}}} = \frac{1.5}{1.33} \approx 1.128.
\]
Thus:
\[
\frac{1}{f_{\text{water}}} = (1.128 - 1) \cdot \left(\frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2}\right) = 0.128 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2}\right).
\]

### Step 3: Ratio of focal lengths
The ratio of the focal lengths in water and air is:
\[
\frac{f_{\text{water}}}{f_{\text{air}}} = \frac{\frac{1}{0.128 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2}\right)}}{\frac{1}{0.5 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{R_1} - \frac{1}{R_2}\right)}} = \frac{0.5}{0.128} \approx 3.91.
\]

### Final Answer
The ratio of the focal lengths of the glass lens in water to that in air is approximately **3.91**, which corresponds to option **I**.
