Okay, I've got this problem in front of me about heat loss in a pipe with insulation. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again carefully.

So, there's a stainless steel pipe with an inner diameter of 6 inches and an outer diameter of 6.5 inches. The thermal conductivity (k) of the steel is 26 Btu/hr-ft-°F. It's insulated with a material that's 3.5 inches thick, and the insulation's k is 0.04 Btu/hr-ft-°F. The inner surface of the pipe is at 500°F, and the outer surface of the insulation is at 150°F. I need to find the rate of heat loss per foot of pipe and the temperature at the interface between the pipe and the insulation.

Wait, right, this is a problem involving heat transfer through cylindrical walls. I remember that the heat transfer through a cylinder can be calculated using the formula for radial heat transfer in cylindrical coordinates. The formula is Q = (2πkL(T1 - T2))/ln(r2/r1), where Q is the heat transfer rate, k is thermal conductivity, L is the length, T1 and T2 are the temperatures, and r1 and r2 are the radii.

But wait, since there are two materials here—the steel pipe and the insulation—the problem is a series of two thermal resistances. So I should model it as two resistances in series: the steel pipe and the insulation. The total heat transfer would be the same through both, so I can calculate the heat loss using the combined thermal resistances.

Let me think about the steps. First, I need to find the radii of the inner and outer surfaces of the steel pipe and the outer radius including the insulation.

Wait, the pipe's inner diameter is 6 inches, so radius r1 is 3 inches. The outer diameter of the pipe is 6.5 inches, so r2 is 3.25 inches. Then the insulation adds another layer; its thickness is 3.5 inches. So the outer radius of the insulation is r3 = 3.25 + 3.5 = 6.75 inches. Oh wait, maybe I should convert inches to feet because the units for k are in feet. So 3 inches is 0.25 ft, 3.25 inches is about 0.2708 ft, and 6.75 inches is 0.5625 ft. Wait, maybe I should just keep everything in inches for calculations and then convert at the end. Maybe that would be easier for now.

Alternatively, since the formula uses the ratio of radii, maybe the units will cancel out as long as they're consistent. Let me think about the thermal resistances.

The thermal resistance for a cylinder is R = ln(r2/r1) / (2πkL). So for the steel part, R1 = ln(r2_steel / r1_steel) / (2πk_steel * L). Similarly, for the insulation, R2 = ln(r3_insulation / r2_steel) / (2πk_insulation * L).

Wait, no. Let me clarify. The steel has inner radius r1 and outer radius r2. The insulation is outside the steel, so its inner radius is the same as the steel's outer radius (r2), and its outer radius is r3 = r2 + insulation thickness.

So the steel's R is ln(r2/r1)/(2πk1 L), and the insulation's R is ln(r3/r2)/(2πk2 L). The total R is R1 + R2.

The overall heat transfer Q is (T1 - T3) / (R1 + R2), where T1 is the inner surface temp (500°F) and T3 is the outer insulation surface temp (150°F). Wait, no, wait. No, T1 is the inside of the steel pipe (500 F), T2 is the outer surface of the steel (which is the inner surface of the insulation), and T3 is the outer surface of the insulation (150 F). But since the problem asks for the temperature at the interface (between steel and insulation, which is T2), I'll need to calculate that as well.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to compute the heat transfer rate first using the overall thermal resistance, then find the interface temperature using the individual resistances.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Compute R1 (steel) and R2 (insulation).
2. Total R = R1 + R2.
3. Q = (T1 - T3) / R_total.
4. Then, using Q, compute T2 = T1 - Q * R1.

Wait, but I can also compute the heat flux through each material and set them equal, but perhaps the series resistance approach is better.

Let me get the numbers straight.

First, I need to compute radii in consistent units. Let me convert everything to feet because the thermal conductivity is given in ft units.

Inner radius of steel (r1): 6 in / 2 = 3 inches → 3/12 = 0.25 ft.

Outer radius of steel (r2): 6.5 in / 2 = 3.25 in → 3.25/12 ≈ 0.2708 ft.

Insulation outer radius (r3): 3.25 in + 3.5 in = 6.75 in → 6.75/12 = 0.5625 ft.

So, R1 (steel) = ln(r2/r1) / (2πk1 L) → ln(0.2708/0.25) / (2π*26*L).

Similarly, R2 (insulation) = ln(r3/r2) / (2πk2 L) → ln(0.5625/0.2708) / (2π*0.04*L).

Wait, but in the denominator, it's 2πkL, so R = (ln(r2/r1))/(2πkL).

Wait, no, correct formula is R = ln(r2/r1) / (2πkL).

Yes.

So let me compute R1 and R2.

Compute R1: ln(0.2708/0.25) → 0.2708 / 0.25 = 1.0832. ln(1.0832) is approximately 0.0800.

So R1 = 0.08 / (2 * π * 26 * L).

Compute the denominator: 2 * π * 26 ≈ 163.3628.

So R1 ≈ 0.08 / 163.3628 → approximately 0.000489 per foot.

Wait, no, because L is in the denominator, the units are per foot.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the numerical value in terms of 1/L.

Wait, maybe it's better to calculate R1 and R2 per foot, so L=1 ft.

So let's compute R1 per foot.

R1 = ln(r2/r1) / (2πk1) → ln(0.2708/0.25) / (2π*26).

Compute ln(1.0832) ≈ 0.0800.

So R1 ≈ 0.08 / (2 * π * 26) → 0.08 / (163.3628) ≈ 0.0004899 (hr·°F·ft)/Btu.

Similarly, compute R2.

r3/r2 = 0.5625 / 0.2708 ≈ 2.078.

ln(2.078) ≈ 0.732.

So R2 = 0.732 / (2π*0.04) → 0.732 / (0.2513) ≈ 2.915 (hr·°F·ft)/Btu.

Wait, wait, let me compute 2π*0.04 = 0.2513.

So 0.732 / 0.2513 ≈ 2.915.

So R_total = R1 + R2 ≈ 0.0004899 + 2.915 ≈ 2.9155 (hr·°F·ft)/Btu.

Now, the heat transfer rate Q is (T1 - T3) / R_total.

T1 is 500°F, T3 is 150°F. So ΔT = 350°F.

So Q = 350 / 2.9155 ≈ 120.06 Btu/hr per foot of pipe.

Wait, let me compute that more accurately. 350 divided by 2.9155.

Hmm, 2.9155 * 120 = 349.86, which is just under 350. So 120.06 is correct.

Wait the options have 120.28, 130.28, etc. So my calculated Q is approximately 120.06, which would round to 120.06. Looking at the options, option G says 120.28, but let me double-check my calculations because perhaps I approximated some values.

Wait, perhaps I was too quick with my calculations. Let me recalculate R1 and R2 more precisely.

Compute R1:

r1 = 0.25 ft, r2 = 0.2708 ft.

r2/r1 = 0.2708 / 0.25 = 1.0832.

ln(1.0832) = Let me compute it accurately.

Using a calculator: ln(1.0832) ≈ 0.07978.

So R1 = 0.07978 / (2 * π * 26).

2 * π ≈ 6.2832, so 6.2832 * 26 ≈ 163.363.

So R1 = 0.07978 / 163.363 ≈ 0.0004885 hr·°F·ft/Btu.

Now R2:

r2 = 0.2708 ft, r3 = 0.5625 ft.

r3/r2 = 0.5625 / 0.2708 ≈ 2.0789.

ln(2.0789) = Let's compute that accurately.

ln(2) is 0.6931, ln(e)=1, so ln(2.0789) is higher than 0.6931. Let me compute it:

2.0789: Let me use a calculator function. Alternatively, I know that ln(2) ≈ 0.6931, ln(2.079) is approximately 0.732.

Wait, perhaps using a calculator would be better. Let me think: 2.079.

Wait, e^0.73 is about e^0.7=2.0138, e^0.73=approx 2.079. So yes, ln(2.079) ≈ 0.73.

So R2 = ln(2.079) / (2 * π * 0.04).

Compute denominator: 2 * π * 0.04 = 0.251327.

So R2 = 0.73 / 0.251327 ≈ 2.906.

So R_total = R1 + R2 ≈ 0.0004885 + 2.906 ≈ 2.9065.

Wait, wait, earlier I had R2≈2.915, now it's 2.906. Hmm, perhaps more accurate is 2.9065.

Now, Q = (500 - 150) / 2.9065 → 350 / 2.9065 ≈ let's compute that.

2.9065 * 120 = 349. (Because 2.9065 * 120 = 349. )

350 - 349 = 1 left. So 350 / 2.9065 = 120 + (1 / 2.9065) ≈ 120 + 0.344 ≈ 120.344 Btu/hr per foot.

Wait, but wait, 2.9065 * 120.344 = 350.

Wait, 2.9065 * 120 = 349. 2.9065 * 0.344 ≈ let's compute 2.9065 * 0.3 = 0.87195, 2.9065 * 0.044 ≈ 0.1279; total ≈ 0.9998. So 120.344 * 2.9065 ≈ 350. So Q is approximately 120.344 Btu/hr-ft.

Looking at the options, option G is 120.28, which is close. But wait, perhaps my approximations are causing some discrepancy. Let me compute more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should carry out the division more precisely.

Compute 350 / 2.9065:

Let me write it as 350 ÷ 2.9065.

2.9065 * 120 = 349. (As 120 * 2.9065 = 349. ) So 350 - 349 = 1.

So 1/2.9065 ≈ 0.344.

So Q ≈ 120.344 Btu/hr per foot.

Looking at the options, the closest is option G: 120.28 Btu/hr-ft. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the calculations again for R2.

Wait, R2 = ln(r3/r2) / (2πk2).

r3/r2 = 0.5625 / 0.2708 ≈ 2.0789.

ln(2.0789) → maybe a more precise value.

Using calculator: ln(2.0789) = approximately 0.732.

Wait, wait, actually, 2.0789: Let me use a more precise method. Let me compute e^0.73: e^0.7 is 2.0138, e^0.73 is e^(0.7+0.03) = e^0.7 * e^0.03 ≈ 2.0138 * 1.03045 ≈ 2.076. So 0.73 corresponds to e^0.73≈2.076, which is a bit less than 2.0789. So perhaps ln(2.0789) is about 0.7305.

Let me compute 0.7305 * 2.9065:

Wait, no, I think the precise value isn't drastically different, perhaps around 0.732.

Wait, perhaps I should use exact values:

Let me calculate ln(2.0789) precisely. Since I don't have a calculator here, maybe I can use a Taylor expansion or interpolation. Alternatively, perhaps I can accept the approximation as 0.732 for now.

So R2 = 0.732 / (2π*0.04) → 0.732 / 0.251327 ≈ 2.915.

Wait, if I take R2 as 2.915, then R_total is R1 + R2 = 0.0004885 + 2.915 ≈ 2.9155.

So Q = 350 / 2.9155 ≈ 350 / 2.9155.

Compute 2.9155 * 120 = 350 (since 2.9155 * 120 = 350 - 0.0006, negligible). So Q is about 120.0 Btu/hr-ft.

Wait, but if R_total is approximately 2.9155, then 350 / 2.9155 ≈ 120.0.

Hmm, but earlier I thought it was 120.344. Maybe because I should carry more decimal points.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the radii.

Wait, let me recalculate the radii in feet correctly.

Inner radius of steel: 6 inches → 0.5 ft? Wait no, wait: 6 inches is half a foot, so 0.5 ft. Wait wait no, 6 inches is 0.5 ft, so radius is 3 inches → 0.25 ft. Correct.

Outer radius of steel: 6.5 inches → 6.5/12 = 0.541666... ft? Wait wait no, wait the diameter is 6.5 inches, so radius is 3.25 inches → 3.25/12 ≈ 0.2708 ft. Correct.

Insulation outer radius: 3.25 inches + 3.5 inches = 6.75 inches → 6.75/12 = 0.5625 ft. Correct.

So the ratios are correct.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the exact value of ln(r3/r2):

r3/r2 = 0.5625 / 0.2708 ≈ 2.0789.

Compute ln(2.0789):

I can compute it as ln(2) + ln(1.03945) → because 2.0789 = 2 * 1.03945.

ln(2) ≈ 0.693147.

ln(1.03945) ≈ using Taylor series: ln(1+x) ≈ x - x^2/2 + x^3/3..., for x=0.03945.

x=0.03945.

ln(1.03945) ≈ 0.03945 - (0.03945)^2 / 2 + (0.03945)^3 / 3.

Compute each term:

0.03945 → 0.03945.

(0.03945)^2 = approx 0.001555, so 0.001555/2 ≈ 0.0007775.

(0.03945)^3 ≈ approx (0.03945)*(0.001555) ≈ 0.0000613, divided by 3 → 0.0000204.

So ln(1.03945) ≈ 0.03945 - 0.0007775 + 0.0000204 ≈ 0.03869.

So ln(2.0789) ≈ 0.693147 + 0.03869 ≈ 0.731837.

So R2 = 0.731837 / (2π * 0.04).

2π*0.04 = 0.251327.

So R2 = 0.731837 / 0.251327 ≈ let me compute that:

0.731837 ÷ 0.251327.

Let me compute 0.251327 * 2.91 = 0.251327 * 2 = 0.50265, 0.251327 * 0.91 = approx 0.2286. So 0.50265 + 0.2286 ≈ 0.73125. So 2.91 would give about 0.73125, which is just below 0.731837. So 2.91 + (0.731837 - 0.73125)/0.251327.

Difference is 0.000587. 0.000587 / 0.251327 ≈ 0.002336.

So R2 ≈ 2.91 + 0.0023 ≈ 2.9123.

So R_total = R1 + R2 = 0.0004885 +
