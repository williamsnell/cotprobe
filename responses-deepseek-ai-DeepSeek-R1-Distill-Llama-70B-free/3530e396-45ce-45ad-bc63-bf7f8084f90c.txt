Okay, so I've got this logic problem to solve. Hmm, let's see. The question involves translating a formula into a natural English sentence using a given key. The formula is (A ∨ ~E) ≡ (D • ~B). The key assigns each letter to a specific action.

First, I need to understand what the formula means. The formula uses logical operators: ∨ is OR, ~ is NOT, and • is AND. The ≡ symbol means equivalence, so both sides must be true or both must be false.

Let me break it down. The left side is (A ∨ ~E), which translates to "Either Marina reads a Percy Jackson book (A) or Ashleigh does not stop by (~E)". The right side is (D • ~B), which is "Russell makes dinner (D) and Izzy does not play Minecraft (~B)".

So the formula as a whole is saying that "Either A or ~E" is equivalent to "D and ~B". In logical terms, that means whenever the left side is true, the right side must also be true, and vice versa.

Now, I need to translate this into a natural English sentence. The question is about necessary and sufficient conditions. I remember that in logic, if P ≡ Q, then P is a necessary and sufficient condition for Q. So here, (A ∨ ~E) is equivalent to (D • ~B), meaning each is a necessary and sufficient condition for the other.

Wait, but I'm looking at the options, and I need to see which one correctly captures this. Let me look through the options.

Option A: "Either Marina reading a Percy Jackson book or Ashleigh not stopping by is a necessary condition for both Russell not making dinner and Izzy not playing Minecraft." Hmm, the necessary condition part is correct because the left side must be true for the right to be true. But wait, the right side is D and ~B, which is Russell makes dinner and Izzy doesn't play Minecraft. So the necessary condition here would be for both D and ~B. But option A says it's necessary for "Russell not making dinner", which is ~D. That's the opposite. So A is incorrect.

Option B: "Either Marina reads a Percy Jackson book or Ashleigh does not stop by just in case both Russell makes dinner and Izzy doesn't play Minecraft." I'm not sure about "just in case". I think it might be trying to say that the left side is equivalent to the right. But the wording is a bit unclear. Maybe "just in case" implies a conditional, but I'm not certain. I'll come back to this.

Option C: "Marina reads a Percy Jackson book or Ashleigh doesn't stop by only if Russell doesn't make dinner and Izzy plays Minecraft." Wait, "only if" usually indicates a necessary condition. So "P only if Q" means P → Q. But our formula is P ≡ Q, which is stronger. So this might not capture the equivalence correctly. Also, the right side here is ~D and B, which doesn't match our formula's right side (D and ~B). So C is wrong.

Option D: "Marina reads a Percy Jackson book unless Ashleigh stops by if, and only if, both Russell makes dinner and Izzy doesn't play Minecraft." "Unless" is similar to "if not", so "A unless E" is E → A. But the formula is A∨~E, which is equivalent to ~E∨A, so the same as A unless E. But the second part is "if and only if (D and ~B)". So the statement becomes (A unless E) ↔ (D and ~B). That seems to align with the formula. So D might be correct. But I need to check other options.

Option E: "Marina reads a Percy Jackson book or Ashleigh does not stop by only when Russell is making dinner and Izzy is not playing Minecraft." "Only when" suggests that the left side happens only when the right side is true, which would mean the left is true → the right is true. But since the formula is an equivalence, it's a two-way implication. So E might not capture both directions. So E is probably not correct.

Option F: "Either Marina reads a Percy Jackson book or Ashleigh doesn't stop by whenever Russell makes dinner and Izzy doesn't play Minecraft." "Whenever" suggests that when the right side is true, the left is true. But again, it's a one-way implication, not the equivalence. So F is incorrect.

Option G: "Marina reading a Percy Jackson book or Ashleigh not stopping by is a necessary condition for Russell not making dinner and Izzy playing Minecraft." Necessary condition means that for the right to be true, the left must be true. The right here is ~D and B, which doesn't match our formula's right side (D and ~B). So G is wrong.

Option H: "Either Marina reading a Percy Jackson book or Ashleigh not stopping by is a necessary and sufficient condition for Russell making dinner and Izzy playing Minecraft." Here, the condition is for (D and B), but our formula's right side is (D and ~B). So H is incorrect.

Option I: "Either Marina reading a Percy Jackson book or Ashleigh not stopping by is a necessary condition for both Russell making dinner and Izzy not playing Minecraft." This says the left is a necessary condition for (D and ~B), which aligns with our formula. Because (A ∨ ~E) must be true for (D and ~B) to be true. But since the formula is an equivalence, both are necessary and sufficient for each other. So I is only stating it as a necessary condition, but not the sufficient part. So maybe I is incorrect because it's missing the 'sufficient' part.

Option J: "Either Marina reading a Percy Jackson book or Ashleigh not stopping by is a necessary and sufficient condition for Russell not making dinner and Izzy playing Minecraft." Again, the right side here is ~D and B, which doesn't match our formula's right side (D and ~B). So J is wrong.

Wait, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine. The formula is (A ∨ ~E) ≡ (D • ~B). So each side implies the other. So (A ∨ ~E) is true exactly when (D and ~B) is true. So (A ∨ ~E) is a necessary and sufficient condition for (D and ~B). But looking at the options, none seem to directly state this except perhaps option D.

Wait, option D says: "Marina reads a Percy Jackson book unless Ashleigh stops by if, and only if, both Russell makes dinner and Izzy doesn't play Minecraft." So "A unless E" is the same as "if E then A", which is E → A, which is equivalent to ~E ∨ A, which is exactly the left side of the formula. Then, the "if and only if" part connects it to (D and ~B). So the entire statement is (A unless E) ↔ (D and ~B), which matches the formula. So D is correct.

Wait, but earlier I thought about option I, which says it's a necessary condition. But option D captures the equivalence, so it's both necessary and sufficient. So D must be the correct answer.

To solve the problem, we need to translate the logical formula \((A \lor \neg E) \equiv (D \cdot \neg B)\) into a natural English sentence using the provided key. The formula states that "Either Marina reads a Percy Jackson book or Ashleigh does not stop by" is equivalent to "Russell makes dinner and Izzy does not play Minecraft." This equivalence means that each side is both a necessary and sufficient condition for the other.

### Key Analysis of the Options:
1. **Option A**: Incorrect. It states that the left side is a necessary condition for "Russell not making dinner," which contradicts the formula since the right side is "Russell makes dinner."
2. **Option B**: Unclear. The phrase "just in case" is ambiguous and does not clearly capture the equivalence relationship.
3. **Option C**: Incorrect. It introduces "only if," which implies a one-way implication, and the right side does not match the formula.
4. **Option D**: Correct. It states that "Marina reads a Percy Jackson book unless Ashleigh stops by if, and only if, both Russell makes dinner and Izzy doesn't play Minecraft." This captures the equivalence relationship, as "A unless E" is equivalent to \(A \lor \neg E\), and "if and only if" ensures the two-way implication.
5. **Option E**: Incorrect. "Only when" suggests a one-way implication, not the equivalence required by the formula.
6. **Option F**: Incorrect. "Whenever" also implies a one-way implication, not the equivalence.
7. **Option G**: Incorrect. It refers to "Russell not making dinner," which contradicts the formula.
8. **Option H**: Incorrect. It refers to "Izzy playing Minecraft," which contradicts the formula.
9. **Option I**: Incorrect. It only states that the left side is a necessary condition, missing the "sufficient" part of the equivalence.
10. **Option J**: Incorrect. It refers to "Russell not making dinner," which contradicts the formula.

### Conclusion:
Option D is the correct answer because it accurately captures the equivalence relationship between the two sides of the formula.
