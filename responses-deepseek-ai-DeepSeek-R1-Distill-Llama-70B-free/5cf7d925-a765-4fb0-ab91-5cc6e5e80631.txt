Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the rotation of the plane of polarization of light when it passes through a glass tubing that's wound with copper wire carrying a current. Hmm, I remember this has something to do with the Faraday effect, right? Because I think the Faraday effect is when a magnetic field causes the plane of polarization to rotate as light passes through a material.

Alright, the question gives me some parameters. The glass tubing is 25 cm long, which is the path length the light travels through. The diameter is 1 cm, but I'm not sure if that matters here. The tubing is wound with 250 turns of enameled copper wire along its entire length. So, the wire is wrapped around the glass, creating a solenoid-like setup, I suppose.

The Verdet constant is given as 0.05 (minute of angle) per (oersted-cm). Wait, so the unit is (minute of angle)/(Oe·cm). And the current through the wire is 5 amperes. I need to find the rotation of the light's polarization plane.

So, the formula I remember is that the rotation angle θ is equal to the Verdet constant V multiplied by the magnetic field B and the length L of the material. So θ = V * B * L. But I need to make sure all the units are compatible.

First, let's figure out the magnetic field B inside the solenoid. The formula for the magnetic field inside a solenoid is B = μ₀ * (N/L_sol), where N is the number of turns, I is the current, and L_sol is the length of the solenoid. Oh wait, no, the formula is B = μ₀ * n * I, where n is the number of turns per unit length. So n is N divided by L, where L is the length of the solenoid.

Wait, the solenoid here is the glass tubing, which is 25 cm long. So the number of turns N is 250, and the length L is 25 cm or 0.25 meters. So n = N/L = 250 / 0.25 = 1000 turns per meter. Then, B = μ₀ * n * I. μ₀ is 4π x 10^-7 T·m/A.

Let me plug in the numbers. I is 5 A. So B = 4πe-7 * 1000 * 5.

Calculating that: 4 * π is about 12.566. 12.566e-7 * 1000 is 12.566e-4. Multiply by 5: 62.83e-4, which is 6.283e-3 Tesla. So about 0.006283 T. Wait, but units are important here. Let me make sure.

Wait, the Verdet constant is given in units of (minute of angle) per (Oe·cm). I know that 1 Tesla is 10^4 Gauss, and 1 Oersted (Oe) is equal to (1 Tesla)/(4π) * (1/(1e4)), wait, no, wait. Let me think. Oh wait, in cgs units, the magnetic field B is measured in Gauss, and the magnetic field H is measured in Oersteds. The relation is B = μ₀ H, but wait, in SI units, B is in Tesla, and H is in A/m. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, Oersted is the unit of magnetic field H. So to get B in Tesla, I need to use B = μ₀ H. But wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe in cgs units, B (in Gauss) is equal to H (in Oersteds) multiplied by 4π. Hmm. Let me clarify.

In the cgs system, the unit of B is Gauss (G), and H is in Oersted (Oe). The relationship is B = H * 4π × 1e-4, because 1 Tesla = 10^4 Gauss, and 1 Oersted is 1e3/(4π) Ampere per meter? Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this. Alternatively, perhaps I should convert the B from Tesla to Gauss and then to Oersteds.

Wait, the Verdet constant is given in terms of Oersted, so I need B in Oersteds. Let's think again.

Alternatively, the solenoid's B is given by B = μ₀ n I. But μ₀ is 4π x 1e-7 T·m/A. So B in Tesla is 4πe-7 * n * I.

But the Verdet constant uses Oersteds, so I need to convert B from Tesla to Oersteds. Because 1 Tesla is 1e4 Gauss, and 1 Oersted is approximately 1 Gauss/cm? No, wait, 1 Oersted is a unit of magnetic field strength H, and in the cgs system, B (in Gauss) equals H (in Oersteds) multiplied by 4π. Wait, maybe it's better to look up the conversion.

Wait, I think that 1 Tesla = 10^4 Gauss. And 1 Oersted is 1 Gauss/(4π). So to convert Tesla to Oersteds, I can do:

1 T = 10^4 G.

So B in Tesla is 6.283e-3 T. Multiply by 1e4 to get Gauss: 6.283e-3 * 1e4 = 62.83 Gauss.

Then, since 1 Oersted is 1 Gauss/(4π), so B in Oersteds is 62.83 / (4π) ≈ 62.83 / 12.566 ≈ 5.0 Oe.

Wait, wait, let me check that. So 1 Oersted = (1 Gauss) * (1/(4π))^{-1}?

No, wait, no. I think the relation is B (G) = μ₀ H (Oe) * 4π × 1e-4.

Wait, perhaps more accurately, the formula is B (in Gauss) = μ₀ (in cgs units) * H (in Oersteds) * 4π × 1e-4? No, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, since the problem gives the Verdet constant in (min of angle)/(Oe·cm), perhaps I can find B in Oersteds directly, so I don't have to convert it.

Wait, but the B from the solenoid is in Tesla. So perhaps I can convert that to Oersteds.

Wait, perhaps it's better to recall that 1 Tesla equals 10^4 Gauss, and 1 Oersted equals 1 Gauss/(4π). So 1 Oersted = 1e-4 Tesla * (1/(4π)).

Wait, no. Let me think again. Let me look up the exact conversion from Tesla to Oersted.

Wait, after a quick search in my memory, I recall that 1 Tesla = 10,000 Gauss, and 1 Oersted is approximately 0.025 Tesla. No, wait, no, that can't be. Because if 1 T is 10^4 Gauss, and 1 Oersted is 1 Gauss × (some factor).

Wait, perhaps this is the correct relation: 1 Oersted = 1 Gauss / (4π × 1e-3) ). No, that's getting more confusing. Alternatively, I think the correct formula is B (in Tesla) = (H in Oersteds) × (μ₀ / (4π)).

Wait, in SI units, B = μ₀ H, where μ₀ is 4πe-7 H/m. So if H is in A/m, B is in Tesla.

But in cgs units, B is in Gauss, H is in Oersteds. The relation is B = 4π × 1e-4 × H. So B (Gauss) = 4π × 1e-4 × H (Oe). Therefore, H (Oe) = B (Gauss) / (4π × 1e-4).

Wait, but I think I'm getting stuck here. Let's try to proceed step by step.

So, the B from the solenoid is 6.283e-3 T. Let's convert this to Gauss. Since 1 T = 1e4 Gauss, so 6.283e-3 T = 6.283e-3 * 1e4 Gauss = 62.83 Gauss.

Now, since 1 Oersted = (1 Gauss) * (1/(4π)) × (1 / something), maybe I should find H in Oersteds.

Wait, the formula in cgs units is B = μ₀ H, but μ₀ in cgs is 4π × 1e-3 (I think). So, perhaps B (G) = (4π × 1e-3) × H (Oe).

So rearranging, H (Oe) = B (G) / (4π × 1e-3).

So for B = 62.83 Gauss:

H = 62.83 / (4 * π * 1e-3).

Calculating the denominator: 4π is about 12.566, multiplied by 1e-3 is 0.012566.

So H = 62.83 / 0.012566 ≈ 5000 Oersteds? That can't be right because 62.83 Gauss is 6.283e-2 Tesla, and 1 Oersted is 1e-3 Tesla, so 62.83 Gauss is 62.83 / 1e4 = 0.006283 T, which is about 6.283 Oersteds. Oh wait, maybe I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, I think I'm mixing up the units. Let me try a different approach.

Wait, I recall that 1 Oersted equals 1e-3 Tesla. So if B is 6.283e-3 T, that's 6.283 Oersteds.

Wait, that makes sense. So B in Oersteds is approximately 6.283 Oe.

So now the rotation angle θ is V * B * L.

Wait, the Verdet constant is 0.05 (minute of angle) per (Oe·cm). So the units are (arcmin)/(Oe·cm).

So V = 0.05 (arcmin)/(Oe·cm).

The length L is 25 cm.

So θ = 0.05 * 6.283 * 25.

Let me compute that.

First, 0.05 * 6.283 = approx 0.31415.

Then, 0.31415 * 25 = approx 7.854 arcminutes.

Wait, but the answer options are in degrees, so I need to convert arcminutes to degrees. Since 1 degree = 60 arcminutes, 7.854 arcminutes is 7.854 / 60 degrees.

7.854 / 60 = 0.1309 degrees.

Wait, that's about 0.13 degrees. Looking at the options, option G is 1.2 degrees, option E is 1.0, option C is 0.5, option J is 0.8. Wait, but 0.13 is close to 0.1, but the options don't have that. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me double-check my steps.

First, the number of turns N is 250, over a length L of 25 cm (0.25 m). So n = N / L = 250 / 0.25 = 1000 turns/m. So that's correct.

Then, B = μ₀ * n * I. So μ₀ is 4πe-7 T·m/A.

So B = 4πe-7 * 1000 * 5 = 4πe-7 * 5000 = 4π * 5e-4.

Wait, 4 * π is about 12.566, so 12.566e-4 = 0.0012566 T.

Wait, wait, I think I messed up earlier. Let's recalculate B.

n = 250 turns / 0.25 m = 1000 turns/m.

I =5 A.

B = μ₀ * n * I = 4πe-7 T·m/A * 1000 m^-1 * 5 A.

So 4πe-7 * 1000 = 4πe-4, then multiplied by 5 gives 2e-3 * π Tesla.

Wait, 4πe-7 * 1000 = 4πe-4, because 1e-7 * 1e3 = 1e-4.

So 4πe-4 * 5 = 20πe-4 = 2πe-3 T.

So B ≈ 2 * 3.1416e-3 T = 6.283e-3 T. That's correct.

Now, to convert B from Tesla to Oersteds.

Wait, 1 Tesla = 1e4 Gauss, and 1 Oersted = 1 Gauss/(4π). So 1 Tesla = 1e4 Gauss = 1e4 * (4π Oersted) )^{-1}.

Wait, perhaps a better approach: 1 Oersted = 1 Gauss / (4π × 1e-3), because in the cgs system, B (G) = μ₀ H, and μ₀ is 4π × 1e-3 (G·cm/A).

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me check online in my mind: 1 Tesla is equal to 10,000 Gauss, and 1 Oersted is equal to 1 Gauss/(4π × 1e-3). So 1 Oersted = 1e3 / (4π) Tesla.

Wait, no. Let me think, 1 Oersted = (1 Gauss) / (4π × 1e-3). So 1 Oersted = 1 / (4πe-3) Gauss^{-1}? No, perhaps I should approach it differently.

Alternatively, let me recall that 1 Oersted equals 1e-3 Tesla divided by (4π). Hmm, no, that doesn't seem right.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to know that 1 Oersted equals approximately 0.025 Tesla. Wait, no, that can't be because 0.025 T is 250 Gauss, and 1 Oersted is 1 Gauss/(4π), so 250 Gauss would be 250/(4π) Oersteds, which is about 19.9 Oersteds. Hmm, that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm just confusing myself, and the correct approach is to accept that 1 Tesla equals 1e4 Gauss, and 1 Oersted is 1 Gauss divided by (4π × 1e-3). So 1 Oersted = (1 Gauss) / (4π × 1e-3) Tesla.

Wait, no, wait. Let's think of it in terms of B and H. In SI units, B (Tesla) = μ₀ H (A/m), where μ₀ is 4πe-7 H/m.

In cgs units, B (Gauss) = 4π × 1e-3 × H (Oersted). So, H (Oe) = B (G) / (4π × 1e-3).

So, given that B in Tesla is 6.283e-3 T, converting to Gauss: 6.283e-3 T * 1e4 G/T = 62.83 G.

Then, H (Oe) = 62.83 G / (4π × 1e-3) = 62.83 / (0.012566) ≈ 5000 Oersteds. Wait, that's a huge number, which can't be right. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting the formula wrong. Maybe in cgs units, B (G) = 4π × 1e-3 × H (Oe). So H (Oe) = B (G) / (4π × 1e-3).

So, for B = 62.83 G:

H = 62.83 / (4π × 1e-3) = 62.83 / 0.012566 ≈ 5000 Oe. That seems way too high, so I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait, maybe my initial approach was correct. Let's think again: the Verdet constant is given in (minute of angle)/(Oe·cm). So to use it, I need B in Oersteds, L in cm.

But perhaps the initial calculation of B in Oersteds is wrong. Let me try an alternative approach without unit conversion.

In the solenoid, B is given by B = μ₀ n I, where μ₀ is 4πe-7 T·m/A, n is 1000 m^-1, I is 5 A.

So B = 4πe-7 * 1000 * 5 = 4πe-7 * 5000 = 4π * 5e-4 = 20πe-4 = 0.002 π Tesla.

Wait, 4πe-7 * 1e3 = 4πe-4, times 5 is 2e-3 π Tesla. So B ≈ 6.283e-3 T.

Now, to convert to Oersteds, since 1 T = 1e4 Gauss, and 1 Oersted = 1 Gauss/(4π × 1e-3) (from the cgs relation B = 4π ×1e-3 H), so H in Oersteds is B (G)/ (4π × 1e-3).

So B = 6.283e-3 T = 62.83 Gauss.

H = 62.83 / (4π × 1e-3) = 62.83 / 0.012566 ≈ 5000 Oersteds.

Wait, that's 5e3 Oersteds, which seems way too high. But that can't be correct because the Verdet constant would then give an enormous rotation, which isn't the case here. So I'm definitely making a mistake in the unit conversion.

Alternatively, perhaps the mistake is in the assumption that B is in Oersteds. Maybe the magnetic field inside the solenoid is given in Tesla, and I need to convert that to Oer
