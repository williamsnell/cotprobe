Alright, so I have this math problem here: I need to find the range of the function y = 5 + 3 * sin(π – x). And then choose the correct option from A to J. Okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, I know that the sine function, sin(θ), usually has a range of [-1, 1]. But here it's multiplied by 3, so that would scale it. So 3 * sin(θ) would have a range of [-3, 3]. Got that part.

Now, the function inside the sine is (π – x). I remember from trigonometry that sin(π – x) is equal to sin(x). Wait, is that right? Let me think. Oh yeah, because sine is symmetric around π/2. So sin(π – x) = sin(x). That simplifies things because the argument inside the sine doesn't affect the range—it just shifts the graph, but the range remains the same. So sin(π – x) is just sin(x), which still ranges from -1 to 1.

So replacing sin(π – x) with sin(x), the function becomes y = 5 + 3 * sin(x). Now, since sin(x) ranges from -1 to 1, multiplying by 3 gives us 3 * sin(x) ranging from -3 to 3. Adding 5 to that shifts the entire range up by 5.

Let me calculate the minimum and maximum values. The minimum occurs when 3 * sin(x) is at its lowest, which is -3. So 5 + (-3) = 2. The maximum is when 3 * sin(x) is at its highest, which is 3. So 5 + 3 = 8. Therefore, the range of y is from 2 to 8.

Now looking at the options, I need to find which one matches 2 ≤ y ≤ 8. Let's see:

Option C says 2 ≤ y ≤ 8. That's exactly what I got. Let me double-check the other options to make sure I didn't pick the wrong one. Option A is -1 to 9, which is wider than my result. Option B is -5 to 5, which seems too narrow and doesn't match. Option D is -3 to 3, but that's just the range of 3*sin(x) without the +5. Option E is 3 to 9, which starts higher than my minimum. Option F is -2 to 10, which is way off. Option G is 0 to 6, too low. Option H is -2 to 8, which includes values below 2. Option I is 0 to 10, nope. Option J is 1 to 7, which doesn’t match either.

So the correct answer must be Option C.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. The function is y = 5 + 3*sin(π - x). Since sin(π - x) equals sin(x), the range calculation holds. Yep, everything checks out. Definitely, the range is from 2 to 8.

The function given is \( y = 5 + 3 \cdot \sin(\pi - x) \). To determine its range, we start by analyzing the sine term. The sine function, \( \sin(\theta) \), has a range of \([-1, 1]\). When multiplied by 3, the term \( 3 \cdot \sin(\pi - x) \) will have a range of \([-3, 3]\). 

Next, we note that \( \sin(\pi - x) = \sin(x) \), so the function simplifies to \( y = 5 + 3 \cdot \sin(x) \). Since \( \sin(x) \) also ranges from \(-1\) to \( 1 \), the term \( 3 \cdot \sin(x) \) ranges from \(-3\) to \( 3 \). Adding 5 shifts this range, resulting in \( y \) ranging from \( 5 - 3 = 2 \) to \( 5 + 3 = 8 \). 

Thus, the range of the function is \( 2 \leq y \leq 8 \), which corresponds to **Option C**.
