Okay, so I've got this transformer problem to solve, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me read the question again.

The problem is about a short-circuit test on a transformer and determining its regulation for a specific load. The given data includes the transformer's rating, test results, and the load conditions. The options are multiple-choice, so I need to compute and find which option matches.

First, let me list the given data:

- Transformer rating: 15 kVA, 2400/240 volts, 60 Hz.
- Short-circuit test results: 6.25 A, 131 V, 214 W.
- Load condition: 0.8 lagging power factor.

The goal is to find the regulation using the approximate equivalent circuit.

Hmm, I remember that the regulation of a transformer is the difference between the no-load voltage and the full-load voltage, expressed as a percentage of the no-load voltage. But I think in this case, since we're given short-circuit test data, we'll use that to find the equivalent circuit parameters and then calculate the regulation under the given load.

I think the approximate equivalent circuit neglects the magnetizing current and uses the series impedance (which includes resistance and leakage reactance). So, the steps might involve:

1. Finding the equivalent resistance (R_eq) and leakage reactance (X_eq) from the short-circuit test.
2. Using these to calculate the voltage drop under the given load.
3. Calculating the regulation based on this voltage drop.

Wait, but in the short-circuit test, the secondary is shorted, so the primary voltage is Vsc, and the primary current is Isc. The power input during the test is Psc, which gives us the equivalent resistance.

Right, the formulas I remember are:

R_eq = Psc / (Isc)^2
X_eq = sqrt( (Vsc)^2 - (Isc * R_eq)^2 )

But wait, since it's a short circuit, Vsc is the voltage applied on the primary when the secondary is shorted, which causes a current Isc. The power Psc is equal to I_sc * V_sc, but wait no, that's not right. Wait, power is V * I, but in this case, the power is the input power during short circuit, which is P_sc = V_sc * I_sc. Alternatively, since the equivalent circuit during short circuit is just R_eq, the power is I_sc^2 * R_eq. So P_sc = I_sc^2 R_eq, which means R_eq = P_sc / (I_sc)^2.

Yes, that makes sense. So first, let's calculate R_eq.

Given:
Psc = 214 W,
Isc = 6.25 A.

So R_eq = 214 / (6.25)^2.

Let me compute that. 6.25 squared is 39.0625. So 214 divided by 39.0625. Let me do this division.

39.0625 * 5 = 195.3125. 214 - 195.3125 = 18.6875. So 5 + (18.6875 / 39.0625) = 5 + 0.478 ≈ 5.478. But wait, 5 * 39.0625 is 195.3125, which is less than 214. Let me compute 214 / 39.0625.

Alternatively, I can compute it as 214 ÷ 39.0625. 39.0625 × 5 = 195.3125. Subtracting 195.3125 from 214 gives 18.6875. Now, 18.6875 ÷ 39.0625 = 0.478. So R_eq ≈ 5.478 ohms.

Wait, but that's the resistance on the primary side. But in the transformer, the voltage and current ratings are different on each side, so when calculating the load regulation, I might need to adjust for the turns ratio.

Wait, the transformer's rating is 2400/240 volts, so the turns ratio a is 2400/240 = 10. So a = 10.

But in the equivalent circuit, the resistance and reactance are referred to the primary or secondary side. I think since the short-circuit test is done on the primary side, with the secondary shorted, the R_eq and X_eq we calculate are on the primary side.

But I'm not entirely sure, so I'll have to think. Alternatively, sometimes the equivalent circuit is referred to the secondary side, but perhaps for the regulation calculation, I can work with the primary side values.

Wait, but the load is connected on the secondary side, so maybe I should refer the equivalent circuit to the secondary side. Hmm, maybe I should adjust R_eq and X_eq to the secondary side before proceeding.

Wait, the regulation is (V_no_load - V_full_load) / V_no_load * 100%. But using the equivalent circuit, the voltage drop is calculated as I_load * (R_eq + jX_eq), and that's subtracted from the no-load voltage to get the full-load voltage.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the load current, its power factor, and calculate the voltage drop in the equivalent impedance.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to work with the per-unit values or to adjust for the transformer's turns ratio.

Let me outline the steps more clearly.

Step 1: Find R_eq and X_eq from the short-circuit test.

Given:
Vsc = 131 V (applied to primary),
Isc = 6.25 A (primary current),
Psc = 214 W.

Using R_eq = Psc / (Isc)^2.

So R_eq = 214 / (6.25)^2 = 214 / 39.0625 ≈ 5.478 ohms. So approximately 5.48 ohms.

Then, X_eq can be found using the formula: X_eq = sqrt( (Vsc)^2 - (Isc * R_eq)^2 )

So Vsc is 131 V, Isc is 6.25 A, R_eq is 5.48 Ω.

Compute Isc * R_eq: 6.25 * 5.48 ≈ 34.25 V.

Then (Vsc)^2 = (131)^2 = 17161.

(Isc R_eq)^2 = (34.25)^2 ≈ 1173.06.

So X_eq = sqrt(17161 - 1173.06) = sqrt(15987.94) ≈ 126.44 ohms.

So R_eq ≈ 5.48 Ω, X_eq ≈ 126.44 Ω.

Now, since the transformer has a turns ratio a = Np / Ns = 2400 / 240 = 10.

Wait, but the equivalent impedance values are on the primary side. So when the load is on the secondary side, the equivalent impedance as seen from the secondary would be R_eq / a² and X_eq / a².

Wait, no. Wait, the equivalent resistance and reactance on the secondary side would be R_eq_secondary = R_eq_primary / a², and similarly for X_eq_secondary = X_eq_primary / a².

Because when you refer impedance to the other side, the impedance scales by 1/a², where a is the turns ratio (primary/secondary).

So, let me compute R_eq_secondary and X_eq_secondary.

R_eq_secondary = 5.48 / (10)^2 = 5.48 / 100 = 0.0548 Ω.

X_eq_secondary = 126.44 / 100 = 1.2644 Ω.

Now, the load is 15 kVA, which is the rated apparent power. The load has a power factor of 0.8 lagging, so it's an inductive load.

We need to find the regulation when the load is 15 kVA at 0.8 PF lagging.

Wait, but the full load current on the secondary would be I_fl = S / V_secondary.

S is 15,000 VA, V_secondary is 240 V.

So I_fl = 15000 / 240 ≈ 62.5 A.

Wait, but the short-circuit test gave us a primary current of 6.25 A, and since the turns ratio is 10, the secondary current would be 6.25 * 10 = 62.5 A, which matches the full-load current. So that makes sense because the short-circuit test essentially gives us the full-load current when the secondary is shorted.

So the full-load current on the secondary is 62.5 A, which flows through the equivalent impedance, causing a voltage drop.

So the voltage drop in the equivalent circuit is I_fl * (R_eq_secondary + j X_eq_secondary * power factor angle).

Wait, but since the load has a power factor of 0.8 lagging, the current is lagging the voltage by an angle θ, where cosθ = 0.8, so θ ≈ 36.87 degrees.

In the approximate equivalent circuit, the voltage drop is mainly due to the load current flowing through the series impedance. The series impedance is R_eq_secondary + j X_eq_secondary.

But because the load's power factor is 0.8 lagging, the impedance's effect on voltage drop can be considered using the phase angle.

Wait, perhaps it's better to compute the voltage drop as I_fl multiplied by the impedance, considering the power factor.

Alternatively, the voltage drop can be found using the formula:

Vd = I_fl * (R_eq_secondary * cosθ + X_eq_secondary * sinθ )

But wait, since the load is lagging, the current is lagging the voltage, so the impedance's effect would have a component in phase with the voltage and a component leading or lagging.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model this as the voltage drop components. Let me think in terms of phasors.

The load current I_fl is at an angle of θ = arccos(0.8) ≈ 36.87 degrees behind the voltage. The impedance has resistance R and reactance X, so the impedance phasor is R + jX. But since the load is lagging, the current is in a certain direction relative to the voltage.

Wait, maybe it's better to compute the voltage drop as the product of the current and the impedance, and then find the magnitude of this drop.

The impedance on the secondary side is Z_eq_secondary = R_eq_secondary + j X_eq_secondary.

So |Z_eq_secondary| = sqrt(R_eq_secondary^2 + X_eq_secondary^2).

So compute that:

R_eq_secondary = 0.0548 Ω,

X_eq_secondary = 1.2644 Ω.

So |Z_eq_secondary| = sqrt(0.0548^2 + 1.2644^2) ≈ sqrt(0.003 + 1.6) ≈ sqrt(1.603) ≈ 1.267 Ω.

Wait, but maybe that's not the right approach because the voltage drop depends on the angle between the current and the impedance.

Alternatively, the voltage drop can be calculated using the formula:

Vd = I_fl * Z_eq_secondary * cosθ + I_fl * Z_eq_secondary * sinθ * j.

But since we're dealing with magnitude for regulation, perhaps we can find the actual voltage drop considering the power factor.

Wait, another approach is to compute the equivalent resistance and reactance as seen by the load current. Since the power factor is 0.8, the impedance can be considered as having a resistance part and a reactance part in relation to the load.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the voltage drop as I² R + I² X tanθ, but I'm not sure that's accurate.

Wait, another approach is to calculate the voltage drop using the formula:

Vd = I_fl * (R_eq_secondary * cosθ + X_eq_secondary * sinθ )

Where θ is the angle of the load current, which is 36.87 degrees since cosθ = 0.8.

So let's compute that.

I_fl = 62.5 A,

R_eq_secondary = 0.0548 Ω,

X_eq_secondary = 1.2644 Ω,

cosθ = 0.8,

sinθ ≈ 0.6 (since θ ≈ 36.87 degrees).

So Vd = 62.5 * (0.0548 * 0.8 + 1.2644 * 0.6 )

Compute each part:

0.0548 * 0.8 = 0.04384,

1.2644 * 0.6 ≈ 0.75864.

Sum: 0.04384 + 0.75864 ≈ 0.80248.

Multiply by I_fl: 62.5 * 0.80248 ≈ 50.155 V.

So the voltage drop is approximately 50.155 volts on the secondary side.

Now, the no-load voltage (V2) is 240 V, as given.

The full-load voltage (V2_fl) will be V2 minus the voltage drop, so 240 - 50.155 ≈ 189.845 V.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, in the equivalent circuit, the voltage drop is the voltage across the series impedance (R_eq + j X_eq). So when the load is applied, the secondary voltage is V2 = E_secondary (no-load voltage) minus the voltage drop across the series impedance.

Wait, no. Wait, the no-load voltage is when there's no current, so the voltage on the secondary is E_secondary. When the load is applied, the voltage at the load terminals is E_secondary minus the voltage drop I_fl * (R_eq_secondary + j X_eq_secondary ). But since we're dealing with magnitudes for regulation, perhaps we can compute the magnitude of the voltage drop and subtract it from the no-load voltage.

Alternatively, perhaps the voltage drop is the component in phase with the load current's voltage. Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing.

Wait, another approach is to calculate the regulation as (Vd) / V2 * 100%, where Vd is the voltage drop.

Wait, but the voltage drop in the equivalent circuit is I_fl * R_eq_secondary for the resistance part, and I_fl * X_eq_secondary for the reactance part, but since the load has a power factor, the effective voltage drop is a combination of these two, considering the phase angle.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is:

Vd = I_fl * R_eq_secondary * cosθ + I_fl * X_eq_secondary * sinθ

Wait, but that's assuming that the current is lagging, so the reactance would cause a voltage drop that's in phase with the voltage but adding to the resistance drop. Alternatively, maybe it's more accurate to model the voltage drop as the phasor sum of IR and IX.

But perhaps to find the magnitude of the voltage drop, it's better to calculate |Vd| = I_fl * sqrt( (R_eq_secondary)^2 + (X_eq_secondary)^2 ) * cos(theta - phi), where phi is the impedance angle.

Alternatively, perhaps since the load's power factor is 0.8, the impedance can be considered as having a certain relation between resistance and reactance. Wait, maybe I should find the equivalent impedance as seen by the load.

Wait, perhaps the voltage drop can be considered as the product of current and the impedance, but adjusted for the power factor.

Wait, maybe another approach is to compute the total impedance Z = R_eq_secondary + j X_eq_secondary. The magnitude of Z is sqrt(0.0548^2 + 1.2644^2) ≈ sqrt(0.003 + 1.600) ≈ 1.267 ohms.

The load current is I_fl = 62.5 A, so the voltage drop magnitude is 62.5 * 1.267 ≈ 79.1875 V.

Wait, but that's the magnitude of the voltage drop, but considering the power factor, perhaps it's not the entire voltage drop that affects the regulation. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up here.

Wait, I think I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try a different approach.

In the approximate equivalent circuit, the voltage regulation is given by:

Regulation (%) = (I_fl * (R_eq_secondary * cosθ + X_eq_secondary * sinθ )) / V2 ) * 100%

So Vd = I_fl * (R_eq_secondary * cosθ + X_eq_secondary * sinθ )

As I calculated earlier, this gives Vd ≈ 50.155 V.

So the full-load voltage on the secondary would be V2_fl = V2 - Vd = 240 - 50.155 ≈ 189.845 V.

Then, the regulation is (V2 - V2_fl) / V2 * 100% = (50.155 / 240) * 100% ≈ 20.898%.

Wait, but that's way higher than any of the options given, which are all below 8%. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, wait. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the voltage drop as the product of the current and the impedance, but with the impedance adjusted by the power factor.

Wait, another thought: since the power factor is 0.8, the resistance and reactance contributions can be weighted accordingly.

Wait, perhaps the formula for voltage regulation using the approximate circuit is:

Vd = I² R_eq_secondary + I² X_eq_secondary * tanθ

But I'm not sure. Alternatively, I might have mixed up the turns ratio somewhere.

Wait, going back, perhaps I should not adjust R_eq and X_eq to the secondary side, but instead keep them on the primary side and calculate the voltage drop accordingly.

Wait, let me re-express everything in terms of primary side.

The turns ratio a = 10.

The load on the secondary is 15 kVA, 240 V, so the current on the secondary is I2 = 15,000 / 240 = 62.5 A.

The primary current I1 is I2 / a = 62.5 / 10 = 6.25 A.

Wait, that's the same current as the short-circuit test. So perhaps the voltage drop on the primary side is I1 times the series impedance (R_eq_primary + j X_eq_primary ), and this voltage drop is then reflected on the secondary side by multiplying by the turns ratio.

Wait, that might make more sense. Let me try that approach.

So, on the primary side, the series impedance is R_eq_primary = 5.48 Ω, X_eq_primary = 126.44 Ω.

The primary current under full load is I1 = 6.25 A.

The voltage drop on the primary side is Vd_primary = I1 * (R_eq_primary * cosθ + X_eq_primary * sinθ )

Wait, but θ is the angle of the load current relative to the primary voltage. Since the load is lagging by θ ≈ 36.87 degrees.

So Vd_primary = 6.25 * (5.48 * 0.8 + 126.44 * 0.6 )

Compute each term:

5.48 * 0.8 = 4.384,

126.44 * 0.6 = 75.864.

Sum: 4.384 + 75.
