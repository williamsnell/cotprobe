Okay, so I've got this problem about bond pricing, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what the question is asking.

The problem states that there's a 3-year bond with a par value of 100 and an annual coupon payment of 6%. I need to find its price given the spot rates for 1, 2, and 3 years. The spot rates are 3%, 4%, and 5%, respectively.

Hmm, I remember that spot rates are the interest rates for zero-coupon bonds, meaning each spot rate applies to a bond that pays its face value at maturity with no coupon payments in between. So, to price a coupon-paying bond, I should discount each coupon payment and the face value separately using these spot rates.

Wait, right. The formula for the price of a bond is the sum of each cash flow divided by (1 + spot rate)^time. So each year's coupon and the final principal are discounted at their respective spot rates.

Let me break it down. The bond pays 6% annually on a par value of 100, so each coupon payment is 6 dollars each year. So the cash flows are:

- Year 1: $6
- Year 2: $6
- Year 3: $106 (because it's the last year, so it includes the par value)

Wait no, wait. Wait, the last payment is 6 + 100 = 106? Oh, no, wait: The coupon is 6% of 100, which is 6 each year. So yes, each year you get 6, and in year 3, you also get the 100 back. So the cash flows are 6, 6, 106.

Now, I need to discount each of these cash flows back to present value using the corresponding spot rates.

So:

PV of Year 1 cash flow: 6 / (1 + 0.03)^1
PV of Year 2 cash flow: 6 / (1 + 0.04)^2
PV of Year 3 cash flow: 106 / (1 + 0.05)^3

Wait, but wait. I'm a bit confused about the spot rates. The 1-year spot rate is 3%, so that's used for the first year. The 2-year spot rate is 4%, so that's for the second cash flow. The 3-year spot rate is 5% for the third cash flow. That makes sense.

So let me calculate each part.

First, the Year 1 PV: 6 divided by 1.03. Let me compute that. 6 / 1.03 = approximately 5.8256. Let me double-check: 1.03 times 5.8256 is about 6.

Second, the Year 2 PV: 6 divided by (1.04)^2. So 1.04 squared is 1.0816. So 6 / 1.0816 is approximately 5.545.

Wait, let me calculate that more accurately. 6 divided by 1.0816. Let's see: 1.0816 * 5.54 = 5.54 * 1 =5.54, 5.54 *0.08=0.4432, 5.54 *0.0016=0.008864. So adding those, 5.54 +0.4432=5.9832 +0.008864=5.992064. Hmm, that's close to 6. So maybe 5.545 is about right. Wait, maybe using a calculator would be better, but since I can't, I'll proceed with approximate values.

Third, the Year 3 PV: 106 divided by (1.05)^3. Let me compute 1.05^3. 1.05 *1.05=1.1025; 1.1025 *1.05 is approximately 1.157625. So 106 / 1.157625. Let's see, 1.157625 times 90 is about 104.186, so that's too low. 91: 1.157625 *91: 91 *1=91, 91 *0.157625≈14.354. So total ≈105.354. Which is close to 106. So 91 would give about 105.35, so 91.5 would be a bit more. Let me try 91.5: 1.157625 *91.5 = ?

Wait, but maybe I'm overcomplicating. Alternatively, 106 / 1.157625 ≈ let's see.

Well, 1.157625 *90 = 104.18625. So 106 is 1.81375 more than that. So, 90 + (1.81375 / 1.157625) ≈ 90 + approx 1.566. So about 91.566? So approximately 91.57.

Wait, no, that's not right because when I multiply 1.157625 by 91.566, I should get around 106. Let me check:

1.157625 * 91 = 1.157625 *90 = 104.18625, plus 1.157625 = 105.343875. So 91 gives 105.343875, which is less than 106. The difference is 0.656125.

So how much more? Each additional 0.01 in the multiplier adds 1.157625 *0.01=0.01157625.

So 0.656125 / 0.01157625 ≈ 56.66. So 0.5666 of a percent. So approximately 91.5666. So about 91.57.

So the present value of the year 3 cash flow is approximately 91.57.

Now, summing all three present values:

Year 1: ~5.8256

Year 2: ~5.545

Year 3: ~91.57

Adding them together: 5.8256 +5.545 = 11.3706 +91.57 = 102.9406.

Wait, that's approximately 102.94. But wait, let me check my calculations again because sometimes approximations can lead to errors.

Wait, maybe I should compute each part more precisely.

Let me compute each term accurately.

First term: 6/(1.03) = 6 ÷ 1.03. Let's compute this:

1.03 × 5 = 5.15 → 5 ×1.03=5.15. Subtract 5.15 from 6: 0.85 remains. Bring down a zero: 8.5.

1.03 × 0.8 = 0.824 → 0.824. Subtract from 8.5 → 8.5 - 0.824 = 7.676. Next digit: bring down zero → 76.76.

1.03 × 7 → 7.21. 7.21 is less than 76.76. 7 ×1.03=7.21. So 7.

So 5.8, and then 7, so 5.87 so far. Wait, perhaps using calculator would be better, but since I can't, perhaps I can note that 1.03 *5.8256 is exactly 6.

So 6/1.03 = 5.8256 exactly.

Second term: 6/(1.04)^2. So 1.04^2 is 1.0816. So 6/1.0816.

Let me compute 6 ÷ 1.0816.

Let me see: 1.0816 × 5 =5.408 → 5 ×1.0816=5.408.

Subtract from 6: 6-5.408=0.592.

So that's 5. Now, we have 0.592. Bring down a zero → 5.920.

How many times does 1.0816 go into 5.920? Let's see, 1.0816 ×5 =5.408. So 5 times. 5.408 subtracted from 5.920 leaves 0.512.

Bring down zero →5.120.

How many times does 1.0816 go into 5.120? Let's see, 1.0816 ×4=4.3264. 5.120 -4.3264=0.7936.

Bring down zero →7.936.

1.0816 ×7=7.5712. 7.936-7.5712=0.3648.

Bring down zero →3.648.

1.0816 ×3=3.2448. Subtract: 3.648-3.2448=0.4032.

So putting it all together: 5.5 (from 5.5 so far) → 5.545? Wait, no. Wait, the first digit after decimal: we had 5, then 5, then 4, etc. So 5.545 approximately.

Wait, but perhaps using a more precise approach, maybe using a formula.

Alternatively, perhaps it's 6 / 1.0816 ≈ 5.545.

Third term: 106/(1.05)^3. We already calculated that 1.05^3 is 1.157625.

So 106/1.157625. Let's compute this.

Compute 1.157625 ×91 = 105.343875, as before. So 91 gives 105.343875, which is less than 106 by 0.656125.

So the remaining is 0.656125. How much more do we need to add to 91 to cover this?

Each 0.01 increase in the multiplier adds 1.157625 ×0.01 = 0.01157625 to the product.

So 0.656125 / 0.01157625 ≈ 56.66.

So, 0.5666. So the total is 91 + 0.5666 ≈91.5666.

So, 106/1.157625 ≈91.5666.

Now, adding all three present values:

Year 1: 5.8256

Year 2: 5.545 (approximately)

Year 3: 91.5666

Total ≈5.8256 +5.545 +91.5666.

Let me compute this step by step.

5.8256 +5.545 = 11.3706.

11.3706 +91.5666 = 102.9372.

So approximately 102.94.

Looking at the options, I see that option J is 102.95. That's very close to my calculation. So the answer should be J.

Wait, but let me check to make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.

Wait, perhaps I should compute each term more accurately.

First term: 6/(1.03) = 5.8256 (exact).

Second term: 6/(1.0816) → let's compute this more precisely.

1.0816 ×5 =5.408, as before.

So 5.408 is 5 ×1.0816.

So 6 -5.408 =0.592.

Bring down a zero →5.920.

Now, 1.0816 ×5 =5.408 → 5.920 -5.408=0.512. So that's 5 after the decimal: 5.5.

Bring down zero →5.120.

How many times does 1.0816 go into 5.120? Let's see: 1.0816 ×4=4.3264. 5.120-4.3264=0.7936.

So that's 4 after the decimal, making it 5.54.

Bring down zero →7.936.

1.0816 ×7=7.5712. 7.936-7.5712=0.3648.

So that's 7, making it 5.547.

Bring down zero →3.648.

1.0816 ×3=3.2448. 3.648-3.2448=0.4032.

So that's 3, making it 5.5473.

So up to this point, it's 5.5473. So approximately 5.5473.

Third term: 91.5666.

So adding all together:

5.8256 +5.5473 =11.3729.

11.3729 +91.5666=102.9395, which is approximately 102.94.

So the total is approximately 102.94, which matches option J: 102.95. There's a slight difference due to rounding, but the closest answer is J.

To determine the price of a 3-year bond with a par value of 100, an annual coupon payment of 6%, and given spot rates of 3%, 4%, and 5% for years 1, 2, and 3 respectively, we calculate the present value of each cash flow and sum them up.

The bond's cash flows are:
- Year 1: $6 (coupon payment)
- Year 2: $6 (coupon payment)
- Year 3: $106 (coupon payment + par value)

The present value of each cash flow is calculated using the formula:

\[
PV = \frac{\text{Cash Flow}}{(1 + \text{Spot Rate})^{\text{Time}}}
\]

1. **Year 1 Cash Flow ($6):**
   \[
   PV_1 = \frac{6}{(1 + 0.03)^1} = \frac{6}{1.03} \approx 5.8256
   \]

2. **Year 2 Cash Flow ($6):**
   \[
   PV_2 = \frac{6}{(1 + 0.04)^2} = \frac{6}{1.0816} \approx 5.545
   \]

3. **Year 3 Cash Flow ($106):**
   \[
   PV_3 = \frac{106}{(1 + 0.05)^3} = \frac{106}{1.157625} \approx 91.5666
   \]

Summing these present values gives the bond's price:

\[
\text{Price} = PV_1 + PV_2 + PV_3 = 5.8256 + 5.545 + 91.5666 \approx 102.9372
\]

This value rounds to approximately 102.94. Among the given options, the closest match is **102.95**, which corresponds to option **J**.
