Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating monthly payments and the true annual interest rate for two different flat rate charges. Hmm, let me think. So, the principal is $500, and it's being repaid over 12 months with equal installments. The charges are 3% and 5% flat rates.

Wait, flat rate usually means that the interest is calculated as a simple interest on the original principal. So for part (a), the charge is 3% of $500. Let me calculate that. 3% of 500 is 0.03 * 500 = $15. So the total interest is $15, making the total amount to repay $515.

Since it's being repaid in 12 equal installments, the monthly payment would be total amount divided by 12. So 515 /12. Let me do that division. 515 divided by 12 is approximately 42.9167, which I can round to about $42.92 per month.

Now for part (b), the charge is 5%. So 5% of 500 is 0.05 *500 = $25. Total amount becomes 525. Divide by 12, that's 525 /12 = 43.75. So monthly payment is $43.75.

But wait, the question also asks for the true annual interest rate. That's the effective annual rate, which is different from the flat rate. The flat rate is just the total interest, but the effective rate considers the time value of money because each payment reduces the principal over time.

To find the true annual rate, I think I need to use the concept of the internal rate of return (IRR) for the loan. The formula for the monthly payment (PMT) is related to the principal (P), the periodic interest rate (r), and the number of periods (n). The formula is PMT = P * r / (1 - (1 + r)^-n). But since we're looking for the effective annual rate, we'll have to find the rate that makes the present value of all payments equal to the principal.

Alternatively, since the monthly payment is known, I can set up an equation where the present value of the 12 monthly payments equals the principal. Let's denote the monthly interest rate as i. So the present value PV is 500 = PMT * [1 - (1 + i)^-12 ] / i.

Wait, let me clarify. For part (a), the monthly payment is $42.92. So 500 = 42.92 * sum of (1/(1+i)^n) for n=1 to 12. The sum is the present value annuity factor.

I think I can use the present value of an ordinary annuity formula: PV = PMT * [(1 - (1 + i)^-n ) / i ]. So solving for i would give the monthly interest rate, and then multiply by 12 to get the annual rate.

But solving this equation for i requires trial and error or using a financial calculator. Since I don't have a calculator here, I'll have to estimate.

Let me take part (a) first. PMT is 42.92. So:

500 = 42.92 * [ (1 - (1 + i)^-12 ) / i ]

I need to find i such that this holds. Let me make a guess for i. Let's try i=0.004 (0.4% monthly). Then the denominator is 0.004. The numerator inside the brackets is (1 - 1/(1.004)^12 ). Let's compute (1.004)^12. 1.004^12 is approximately 1.048. So 1 - 1/1.048 is about 0.456. Then 0.456 / 0.004 is 114. So 42.92 * 114 = 42.92 * 100 is 4292, 42.92 *14 is about 601. So 4292 +601=4893. But wait, that's way bigger than 500. Hmm, that can't be right. Wait, no, I'm getting confused. Wait, no, 42.92 * (0.456/0.004) would be 42.92 * 114 = 4891.68. But that's way larger than 500. So I must have made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, no. The present value factor is [ (1 - (1 + i)^-n ) / i ], which is multiplied by PMT to get PV. So for i=0.004, [ (1 - 1.004^-12 ) / 0.004 ].

Wait, 1.004^12 is approx 1.048, so 1/(1.048)=0.954, so 1 - 0.954=0.046. So 0.046 / 0.004 is 11.5. So 42.92 *11.5 is about 493. That's close to 500. So i is a little higher than 0.004.

Wait, let's try i=0.0045 (0.45% monthly). Then (1.0045)^12. Let me compute this step by step.

(1.0045)^1 =1.0045
^2=1.009025
^3≈1.01358
^4≈1.01823
^5≈1.02294
^6≈1.02768...
Wait, maybe a better approach is to use the formula: (1 + i)^n = e^(n * ln(1+i)).

ln(1.0045)≈0.004494. Multiply by 12: 0.053928. e^0.053928≈1.0555. So (1.0045)^12≈1.0555. So 1/(1.0555)=0.947. So 1 - 0.947=0.053. Then 0.053 / 0.0045≈11.777. So PV factor is ~11.777. Then 42.92 *11.777≈42.92 *11=472.12; 42.92 *0.777≈33.35. Total≈505.47. That's a bit higher than 500. So the PV is 505.47 when i=0.45%. Since we need PV=500, we need a slightly higher i to reduce the present value.

Wait, higher i would make the denominator smaller, so the overall factor smaller. Let me try i=0.0048 (0.48%). Let's compute (1.0048)^12.

ln(1.0048)=approx 0.004796. Multiply by 12: 0.057552. e^0.057552≈1.0592. So (1.0048)^12≈1.0592. So 1/(1.0592)=≈0.944. So 1-0.944=0.056. 0.056 /0.0048≈11.6667. So 42.92 *11.6667≈42.92*(11 + 2/3)= approx 42.92*11=472.12 + 42.92*(2/3)=28.61 → total≈500.73. Wait, that's very close to 500. So the present value is 500.73 at i=0.48%. We need PV=500, which is a bit lower, so perhaps i is a little higher.

Wait, maybe i=0.48%, which gives PV=500.73, which is a bit over 500. So let me try i=0.485% (0.00485).

Compute (1.00485)^12.

ln(1.00485)=approx 0.00485*0.9999≈0.00485. Multiply by12: 0.0582. e^0.0582≈1.0601. So 1/(1.0601)=0.9435. 1 -0.9435=0.0565. 0.0565 / 0.00485≈11.642. So 42.92 *11.642≈42.92 *11=472.12; 42.92 *0.642≈27.56. Total≈499.68. That's very close to 500. So i≈0.485% per month.

So the monthly rate is approximately 0.485%, so the annual rate is 0.485% *12=5.82%. Rounded to the nearest tenth, that's 5.8% or 5.8%. But wait, let me double-check because these small differences can affect the rounding.

Wait, 0.485% *12=5.82%, which is 5.8% when rounded to the nearest tenth.

Wait, but when I calculated for i=0.0048 (0.48%), the PV was 500.73, which is a bit higher than 500. So perhaps I need a slightly higher i to bring the PV down to 500. Let's try i=0.00485 (0.485%).

We saw that at i=0.485%, the PV is approximately 499.68, which is just below 500. So the correct i is between 0.48% and 0.485%. Let me try i=0.483%.

Compute (1.00483)^12.

ln(1.00483)=approx 0.00483. *12=0.05796. e^0.05796≈1.0597. Wait, no, wait: e^0.05796 is approx 1.0597? Let me think again. e^0.05 is about 1.05127; e^0.06 is about 1.0618. So 0.05796 is 0.058, which is between 0.05 and 0.06. So e^0.058≈approx 1.0595.

So (1.00483)^12≈1.0595. So 1/1.0595≈0.944. 1-0.944=0.056. 0.056 /0.00483≈11.607. So 42.92 *11.607≈42.92 *11=472.12; 42.92 *0.607≈26.05. Total≈498.17, which is below 500. Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Maybe I should use linear interpolation between i=0.48% (PV=500.73) and i=0.485% (PV=499.68). The difference in PV is 500.73 -499.68=1.05 when i increases by 0.005% (from 0.48 to 0.485% is 0.005%). We need to find the i where PV=500 is between i=0.48% (500.73) and i=0.481%.

Wait, perhaps I can approximate it as follows: Let’s define i as 0.48% + x, where x is a small increment to reach PV=500. The PV at i=0.48% is 500.73. At i=0.48% + x, the PV decreases by (500.73 -500)=0.73 as x increases. The change in PV with respect to i can be approximated using the derivative, but perhaps a simpler approach is to estimate how much x is needed to reduce the PV by 0.73.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the present value of an annuity:

PV = PMT * [ (1 - (1 + i)^-n ) / i ]

We can rearrange this to solve for i, but it's nonlinear, so it's tricky without a calculator. Alternatively, perhaps I can use an approximate formula or iterative method.

But perhaps a better approach is to use the rule of 78 or something else. Wait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should instead use an approximate effective interest rate formula. The effective annual rate (EAR) when payments are made monthly can be calculated using the formula:

EAR = (1 + i)^12 - 1,

where i is the monthly interest rate.

But I'm trying to find i such that the present value of the payments equals the principal. So let's make a better approach. Since I can't compute it exactly, maybe I can use the options given to see which one aligns.

Looking at the options, option B says for 3% flat rate, the monthly payment is $42.92 and the true annual rate is 5.5%. Option J has a lower rate. Option H has 5% rate. Wait, let's see.

Wait, I calculated the monthly payment for 3% as $42.92, which matches option B for part (a). Now, the true annual rate for part (a) would be around 5.8%, but the options for part (a) in B say 5.5%. Hmm. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the true annual rate. Let me try another approach. The monthly payment is $515 /12 = $42.92 (wait, no, wait: 3% of 500 is 15, so total 515, divided by 12 is 42.92). Correct.

The true annual rate is the rate that when applied to the principal, with each payment reducing the balance, gives the same monthly payment. So it's the internal rate of return.

Alternatively, using the formula for the effective interest rate when payments are made each month:

The effective rate can be approximated by the formula:

EAR ≈ (2 * n * i) / (n + (n-1) * i),

where n is the number of payments, and i is the periodic interest rate. But I'm not sure if that's the right formula here.

Alternatively, perhaps the effective annual rate can be found by:

EAR = (1 + r)^12 -1,

where r is the monthly rate. So I need to find r such that the present value of the payments is 500.

Wait, let me try an example. Let's say the true monthly rate is 0.485%, so annual is 5.82%. But looking at the options, option E for part (a) has a true rate of 6.5%, which is higher. Option B says 5.5%.

Wait, perhaps I should see what the options suggest. Let's look at the options.

Option B: Monthly payments $42.92 at 3% and $43.75 at 5%; True annual rates 5.5% and 9.2%.

Option J: payments 42.92 and 43.75, rates 4.5% and 8.2%.

Wait, but earlier my calculation for part (a) gave a true rate of approximately 5.8%, but none of the options have that. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula for the effective annual rate when the interest is simple. Wait, no, the flat rate is simple interest, but the true rate is the effective rate considering the repayments.

Wait, another approach: the total interest is $15 in part (a), but the true interest is calculated based on the average outstanding balance. The average balance over the year would be (500 + 0) / 2 = 250, because each payment reduces the principal. So the true interest would be 15 / 250 = 0.06, which is 6%. But that's an approximation. However, the options don't have exactly 6%, but option E for part (a) has 6.5%, and option C has 6.8%.

Wait, this method gives 6% as the approximate true rate. So the options might have something near that.

Wait, but perhaps a better way is to compute the true annual rate by finding the internal rate of return of the loan.

The IRR is the rate that makes the NPV of all cash flows zero. The initial outlay is $500, and then 12 monthly payments of $42.92.

So the equation is:

500 = 42.92/(1+r)^1 + 42.92/(1+r)^2 + ... +42.92/(1+r)^12.

We need to find r, the monthly interest rate, then multiply by 12 to get the annual rate.

To solve this without a calculator, perhaps I can estimate.

If r is 0.5%, then the present value factor for 12 periods is:

sum = [1 - (1.005)^-12 ] / 0.005.

Calculate (1.005)^12: approx 1.0617. So 1/1.0617 ≈ 0.9417. 1 -0.9417=0.0583. 0.0583/0.005≈11.6667. So sum≈11.6667. Then PV=42.92 *11.6667≈500. So that would mean r=0.5% per month, giving an annual rate of 6%. But earlier approximation gave 6%, but when I tried i=0.48%, I got a PV close to 500.

Wait, wait, perhaps I was overcomplicating it. Let me try r=0.5% per month:

Each payment is $42.92.

The present value would be 42.92 * [ (1 - 1/(1.005)^12 ) / 0.005 ].

As above, [ (1 - 1/1.0617 ) /0.005 ] = (0.0583)/0.005 =11.6667.

So 42.92 *11.6667≈500. So that's exactly matching. So r=0.5% per month, so annual rate is 6.0%.

But wait, earlier when I used i=0.48%, I got a PV of 500.73, which is a bit higher than 500, suggesting that the interest rate is a bit lower than 0.5%. Hmm, perhaps I need to recalculate.

Wait, at r=0.5% per month, the PV is exactly 500, which is the principal. So the true annual rate is 0.5% *12=6.0%, which would round to 6.0%.

Looking back at the options, which ones have a true annual rate near 6% for the 3% flat rate?

Option C: 6.8% at 3%, which is higher. Option E:6.5% at 3%. Option B:5.5%. Hmm, none have exactly 6.0. So perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect. Because the flat rate is 3%, so the interest is 15, and the payments are 42.92. Let me compute the total interest paid over the
