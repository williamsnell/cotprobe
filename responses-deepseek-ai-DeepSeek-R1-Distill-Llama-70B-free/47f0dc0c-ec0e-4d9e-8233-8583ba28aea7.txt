Question:

While on vacation, two friends went scuba diving in the ocean. Each of them was equipped with a spear gun, which they planned to use to kill tuna. As they were swimming, both men saw what appeared to be a large fin entangled in a nearby coral reef. Simultaneously, they shot their spear guns at the projecting wing-like figure. Unbeknownst to either of the friends, it was not a fish but rather another scuba diver. The victim was struck and slightly wounded by one of the spears. The victim asserts a claim for damages against the two friends. At trial, the judge should instruct the jury to rule

Options:

A: against both defendants jointly unless one of them proves that he did not shoot the spear that struck the victim.
B: against each defendant for one-half of the amount of damages, because they both acted independently and not jointly.
C: in favor of both defendants if no evidence is presented showing who actually shot the spear that injured the victim.
D: against each defendant for one-half of the amount of damages, because they both shot their spear guns simultaneously.
E: in favor of the victim, as both defendants acted recklessly in a situation that required caution.
F: against the defendant who cannot prove he did not shoot the spear, while the other defendant is exempt from damages.
G: against each defendant for one-third of the amount of damages, with the remaining one-third to be determined by the jury.
H: in favor of both defendants if the victim cannot prove beyond a reasonable doubt who shot the spear that injured him.
I: against both defendants for the full amount of damages, as they were both responsible for the situation.

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about tort law, specifically dealing with joint liability in a negligence case. Let me think through this step by step.

Alright, the scenario is that two friends went scuba diving and each had a spear gun to kill tuna. They saw something that looked like a large fin stuck in coral and both shot their spears at the same time. But it turned out it wasn't a fish, it was another diver. One spear hit and slightly wounded the victim. Now, the victim is suing both friends.

The question is about what the judge should instruct the jury regarding liability. The options are from A to I.

So, I remember that in torts, when two or more defendants cause harm, especially in a situation where their actions are considered joint, they can be held jointly and severally liable. This means each defendant can be held responsible for the entire amount of damages. But wait, this is usually when they act in concert or their actions are so intertwined that it's impossible to tell who did what.

In this case, both shot their spears at the same time, aiming at what they thought was a tuna. They acted independently but simultaneously. Each of them might have been negligent in not ensuring that their target was actually a fish and not a person. So each of their actions could be considered negligent.

The key here is that the harm was caused by one of the spears, but it's unknown which one. So the problem is about causation and how it applies when multiple actors are involved.

I think this relates to the concept of alternative liability. When two or more defendants commit tortious acts and the harm is caused by one of them, but it's not possible to determine which one, the court can hold both liable. This is based on the idea that each had the capacity to cause the harm, so they are each responsible.

So in such cases, the burden shifts to the defendants to prove that they were not the one who caused the harm. If they can't, then both are liable. So the plaintiff only needs to prove that one of the defendants caused the harm, without needing to prove which one.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the jury should rule against both unless one proves they didn't shoot the spear. That sounds like shifting the burden to the defendants, which aligns with alternative liability. So this could be correct.

Option B says each is liable for half. But that's more like several liability, where each is only responsible for their portion. But in joint liability, each can be held for the full amount.

Option C says both are favored if no evidence shows who shot. Wait, no, if there's no evidence, the burden is on the defendant, so this doesn't seem right. The plaintiff doesn't have to prove which one did it.

Option D says each pays half because they shot at the same time. Again, that's not joint liability.

Option E says in favor of the victim because both acted recklessly. Well, the issue is more about causation and liability, not just recklessness.

Option F says against one who can't prove they didn't shoot. So only one is liable, which doesn't fit the alternative liability where both are liable unless they can prove innocence.

Option G splits the damages into thirds, which doesn't fit standard joint liability.

Option H says in favor of defendants if the victim can't prove beyond a reasonable doubt. But this is a civil case, so the standard is preponderance of evidence, not beyond a reasonable doubt. Also, the victim doesn't need to prove which one did it.

Option I says both are liable for the full amount. That sounds like joint and several liability, which is correct if they're acting in a way where their actions are considered together.

Wait, but in this scenario, each acted independently. So are they considered acting in concert? Or is it a situation where each is independently negligent, but it's impossible to tell whose act caused the harm.

So in the case of alternative liability, where each defendant's action could have caused the harm, but it's not possible to tell which, both are held liable. So the plaintiff can recover the full amount from either defendant.

So looking back, option A says against both unless one proves they didn't shoot. That's the correct approach because the burden is on the defendants to show they didn't cause the harm. If they can't, both are liable.

Option I says against both for the full amount. That's also a possibility, but in some cases, each defendant is jointly liable, meaning the plaintiff can choose to recover from either or both.

Wait, but in this question, the spear wounded the victim, but it's not clear who's spear it was. So the victim can sue both, and each is liable for the full amount, but the victim can only recover once, not twice. So the instruction should be that both are liable unless they can prove they didn't do it.

So option A says the jury should rule against both unless one proves they didn't shoot. That's correct because it shifts the burden to the defendants.

Wait, but let me double-check. In some jurisdictions, when two defendants act negligently and it's impossible to determine who caused the harm, each can be held fully liable. So the plaintiff can recover the entire amount from either defendant. So the instruction would be that both are liable unless they can prove they didn't cause it.

So the correct answer would be A, I think.

But wait, another thought. Option I says against both for full damages. So that's the joint and several liability approach. But the alternative liability approach is when each could have caused the harm, so both are liable. So the instruction would be that both are liable unless they can show they didn't do it.

So yes, option A reflects that.

The question revolves around the liability of two defendants who simultaneously shot spear guns at what they believed to be a fish, but it turned out to be another diver who was wounded. The key issue is determining how the jury should be instructed regarding liability, particularly in a scenario where it is impossible to identify which defendant caused the harm.

In tort law, when multiple defendants act in a way that their actions could have caused the harm, but it is impossible to determine which one actually did so, the doctrine of alternative liability applies. Under this doctrine, both defendants can be held jointly and severally liable for the harm unless one of them can prove that they did not cause the injury. This shifts the burden of proof to the defendants to show that they were not the ones responsible for the harm.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: This aligns with the doctrine of alternative liability. It correctly states that the jury should rule against both defendants unless one of them can prove they did not shoot the spear that caused the harm. This is the correct approach.
- **Option B**: This suggests several liability, where each defendant is only responsible for half of the damages. This does not align with the doctrine of joint and several liability, which holds each defendant fully responsible for the harm.
- **Option C**: This incorrectly states that the defendants should be favored if no evidence identifies who caused the harm. The burden of proof is on the defendants, not the plaintiff, to show which one caused the harm.
- **Option D**: Similar to Option B, this divides liability equally, which does not reflect the principles of joint and several liability.
- **Option E**: While recklessness may be a factor, the question focuses on causation and liability, not just the defendants' reckless behavior.
- **Option F**: This suggests liability for only one defendant, which does not reflect the joint and several liability principle.
- **Option G**: This introduces an arbitrary division of liability, which is not consistent with the doctrine of alternative liability.
- **Option H**: This incorrectly applies a criminal standard of proof ("beyond a reasonable doubt") to a civil case, where the standard is "preponderance of the evidence."
- **Option I**: While this reflects joint and several liability, it does not account for the possibility that one defendant may prove they did not cause the harm, which is addressed in Option A.

The correct instruction is that both defendants are liable unless one of them can prove they did not shoot the spear that caused the harm. This is best reflected in **Option A**.

**Answer: A**
