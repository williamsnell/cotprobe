Okay, so I've got this physics problem about the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom. Hmm, I remember the Bohr model is an early model where the electron orbits the proton in circular paths with quantized radii. The question is asking for the speed of the electron in the smallest allowed orbit.

Wait, the problem gives a0 as 52.92 pm. Oh right, a0 is the Bohr radius. So the smallest orbit would be when n=1, right? Because in Bohr's model, the radius is quantized as r_n = n² * a0, so for n=1, r is a0.

I think the formula for the speed of the electron in the nth orbit is something like v_n = (e²)/(2ε₀h) * (1/n), but wait, maybe I should recall it differently. Another approach: the centripetal force is provided by the Coulomb force. So mv²/r = (k e²)/r². Rearranging that gives v² = (k e²)/(m r). Taking square root, v = sqrt( (k e²)/(m r) ).

Oh right, and in the Bohr model, the angular momentum is quantized as m v r = n ħ. Wait, I think that's another formula I could use. Maybe I can get the speed from that, but perhaps using the Coulomb approach is more straightforward.

Let me see, I'll need the constants: e is the elementary charge, m is the electron mass, k is Coulomb's constant.

Wait, let me jot down the known constants:

- e (elementary charge) = 1.602 x 10^-19 C
- m (electron mass) = 9.109 x 10^-31 kg
- k (Coulomb's constant) = 8.988 x 10^9 N·m²/C²
- a0 (Bohr radius) = 52.92 pm = 52.92e-12 meters

So the radius r is a0, which is 52.92e-12 m.

So plugging into v = sqrt( (k e²)/(m r) )

Let me compute the numerator and denominator step by step.

Compute e squared: (1.602e-19 C)^2 = (approx) 2.566e-38 C².

Multiply by k: 8.988e9 N·m²/C² * 2.566e-38 C² = let's see. 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = 8.988 * 2.566 is roughly 23.06, and 10^9 * 1e-38 is 1e-29. So 23.06e-29 = 2.306e-28.

Then divide by m * r: m is 9.109e-31 kg, r is 52.92e-12 m. So denominator is 9.109e-31 * 52.92e-12 = multiply the numbers: 9.109 *52.92 is about 482.5, and exponents: 1e-31 *1e-12 = 1e-43. So denominator is 482.5e-43 = 4.825e-41.

So v squared is (2.306e-28) / (4.825e-41) = (2.306 / 4.825) ) * 1e13.

Wait 2.306 /4.825 is approximately 0.477. So 0.477e13 is 4.77e12. So v squared is 4.77e12 m²/s². Taking square root, v is sqrt(4.77e12) = approx 6.91e6 m/s. Wait, that can't be right because I thought the speed is about 2 million m/s. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait let me recalculate more accurately. Maybe I messed up the exponents.

Let me redo the calculation step by step.

Compute e²: (1.602e-19)^2 = (1.602)^2 *1e-38. 1.602 squared is about 2.566, so 2.566e-38 C².

Multiply by k: 8.988e9 * 2.566e-38 = (8.988 *2.566) is approximately 23.06, and exponents 1e9 *1e-38 =1e-29. So 23.06e-29 = 2.306e-28.

Denominator: m * r = 9.109e-31 kg * 52.92e-12 m. Multiply 9.109 *52.92 = Let's calculate that: 9 *50 is 450, but more accurately: 9.109 *52.92.

Let me compute 9 *52.92 = 476.28, 0.109 *52.92 is about 5.77. So total is approximately 476.28 +5.77 = 482.05. So 482.05e-43 kg·m. Because 1e-31 *1e-12 is 1e-43.

So denominator is 4.8205e-41 kg·m.

So numerator is 2.306e-28, denominator 4.8205e-41.

2.306e-28 /4.8205e-41 = (2.306 /4.8205 ) * 1e13.

2.306 /4.8205 is approximately 0.478.

So 0.478e13 = 4.78e12 m²/s².

v = sqrt(4.78e12) ≈ let's see. sqrt(4.78e12) = sqrt(4.78) *1e6. sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(4.78) is about 2.19. So 2.19e6 m/s.

Looking at the options, option J is 2.19e6 m/s. Option A is 2.29e6, close but not exact. So perhaps I made a small error in the approximation.

Wait wait, perhaps I should calculate more precisely. Let me be exact with the numbers.

Let me compute e²:

e = 1.602176634e-19 C (exact value now), so e^2 = (1.602176634e-19)^2 = approximately 2.56696968e-38 C².

k = 8.9875517879e9 N·m²/C².

Calculate k*e²: 8.9875517879e9 * 2.56696968e-38.

8.9875517879e9 ≈ 8.98755e9.

8.98755e9 * 2.56696968e-38 = ?

Multiply 8.98755 * 2.56696968 = Let's compute that:

8 * 2.56697 is about 20.5358.

0.98755 *2.56697 ≈ approx 2.536.

Wait, more accurately:

2.56696968 *8.9875517879 = ?

2.56696968 *8 =20.53575844.

2.56696968 *0.9875517879 ≈ 2.534 (exact calculation would be better, but perhaps it's sufficient to proceed).

So approx 20.5358 +2.534 ≈23.07. So 23.07e(9-38) → 23.07e-29 = 2.307e-28.

Denominator: m is 9.1093837015e-31 kg. r is 52.92e-12 m.

m*r =9.1093837015e-31 *52.92e-12 = 9.1093837015 *52.92 *1e-43.

Compute 9.1093837015 *52.92:

9 *52.92 =476.28.

0.1093837015 *52.92 ≈ 5.79 (approx).

So 476.28 +5.79 =482.07. So 482.07e-43 →4.8207e-41.

So numerator is 2.307e-28, denominator 4.8207e-41.

So 2.307e-28 /4.8207e-41 = (2.307 /4.8207) ) * 1e13.

2.307 /4.8207 = let's compute that. 4.8207 *0.478 = approx 2.303. Close to 2.307. So 0.478 approx.

So 0.478 *1e13 =4.78e12 m²/s².

v= sqrt(4.78e12) = sqrt(4.78) *1e6.

sqrt(4) is 2, sqrt(5) is about 2.236. So 4.78 is closer to 4.84 which is (2.2)^2=4.84. Wait wait, 2.19^2 is (approx) 4.7961. Because 2.19*2.19= 4.7961.

So sqrt(4.78) ≈2.19.

So v≈2.19e6 m/s.

Looking at the options, option J is 2.19e6 m/s. So the correct answer should be J.

Wait but let me double-check because sometimes factors come in. Oh wait, perhaps I should remember that in the Bohr model, the speed is given by v_n = (e²)/(2 ε0 h) * (1/n), but maybe I should use that formula as another approach.

Alternatively, using the formula v = α c / n, where α is the fine-structure constant and c is speed of light. Wait, α is approximately 1/137, and c is 3e8 m/s.

So for n=1, v = (1/137)*3e8 ≈ 2.19e6 m/s. Which matches what I got earlier.

So yes, the correct answer is J.

To determine the speed of the electron in the smallest allowed orbit of the Bohr model, we use the formula derived from the balance of centripetal and Coulomb forces:

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{k e^2}{m r}}
\]

where:
- \( k = 8.9875517879 \times 10^9 \, \mathrm{N \cdot m^2 / C^2} \) (Coulomb's constant),
- \( e = 1.602176634 \times 10^{-19} \, \mathrm{C} \) (elementary charge),
- \( m = 9.1093837015 \times 10^{-31} \, \mathrm{kg} \) (electron mass),
- \( r = a_0 = 52.92 \, \mathrm{pm} = 52.92 \times 10^{-12} \, \mathrm{m} \) (Bohr radius).

### Step 1: Compute \( e^2 \)
\[
e^2 = (1.602176634 \times 10^{-19})^2 = 2.56696968 \times 10^{-38} \, \mathrm{C^2}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( k e^2 \)
\[
k e^2 = (8.9875517879 \times 10^9) \times (2.56696968 \times 10^{-38}) = 2.307 \times 10^{-28} \, \mathrm{N \cdot m^2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( m r \)
\[
m r = (9.1093837015 \times 10^{-31}) \times (52.92 \times 10^{-12}) = 4.8207 \times 10^{-41} \, \mathrm{kg \cdot m}.
\]

### Step 4: Compute \( v^2 \)
\[
v^2 = \frac{k e^2}{m r} = \frac{2.307 \times 10^{-28}}{4.8207 \times 10^{-41}} = 4.78 \times 10^{12} \, \mathrm{m^2 / s^2}.
\]

### Step 5: Compute \( v \)
\[
v = \sqrt{4.78 \times 10^{12}} = \sqrt{4.78} \times 10^6 \approx 2.19 \times 10^6 \, \mathrm{m/s}.
\]

### Final Answer
The speed of the electron in the smallest allowed orbit is approximately \( 2.19 \times 10^6 \, \mathrm{m/s} \), which corresponds to **option J**.
