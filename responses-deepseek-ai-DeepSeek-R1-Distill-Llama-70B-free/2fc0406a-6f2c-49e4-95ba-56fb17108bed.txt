Okay, I need to figure out the generators of the additive cyclic group Z. Hmm, let me start by recalling what a cyclic group is. A cyclic group is a group that can be generated by a single element. That means every element in the group can be written as some power (or multiple, in the case of addition) of that generator.

Wait, but wait. Z is the group of all integers under addition, right? So it's an infinite cyclic group. I remember that in additive notation, the operation is addition, so the 'powers' are multiples. So the generator would be an element such that its multiples generate the entire group.

So what's a generator of Z? Well, in additive groups, the generator is usually an element that can reach every other element by adding it to itself repeatedly. For Z, the simplest choice is 1 because adding 1 repeatedly gives you all integers. Similarly, -1 would also work because you can get all integers by adding -1 multiple times (which is like subtracting 1 each time).

Looking at the options, I see options A, D, I, J, etc. Let me check each. Option A is [1, -1]. So that's two elements. Wait, but isn't a generator just a single element? Or can it be a set of elements that together generate the group?

Oh, right! The question is about the generators, which could be a generating set. But wait, in the case of a cyclic group, the entire group can be generated by a single element. So the generating set could consist of just one element. But do any of the options have a single element that's a generator?

Wait, looking again. The options are presented as lists. For example, option A is [1, -1]. So it's a set containing 1 and -1. But since 1 alone can generate Z, maybe a set containing just 1 would be the minimal generating set. But I don't see any option with [1] alone. Let me look at the options.

Option A: [1, -1] â€” contains both 1 and -1. But since 1 and -1 can each individually generate Z, maybe either is sufficient, but do they need both? Or is the question looking for all possible generators?

Wait, the question is phrased as "what are the generators", so perhaps it's looking for all elements that can generate Z. So any element that is 1 or -1, or any integer that's relatively prime to the order of the group. But wait, Z is infinite, so every element except 0 has infinite order. So any non-zero integer can generate a subgroup, but only 1 and -1 generate the entire group Z. Because, for example, 2 generates 2Z, which is a proper subgroup of Z.

Ah, so the generators of Z as a group are exactly the elements 1 and -1. Because they're the only elements whose multiples (under addition) give all integers. Any other integer k besides 1 and -1 would only generate multiples of k, which is a proper subgroup.

Wait, but wait. Let me think. Let's say we have an element k where k is 2. The subgroup generated by 2 is {..., -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, ...}, which is 2Z. That's not the entire group Z. So yes, only 1 and -1 can generate the entire group.

So looking at the options, which option includes both 1 and -1? Option A is [1, -1], option D is [-1, 1], which is the same as A. But wait, are options A and D the same? Because order doesn't matter in a set. So both A and D are the same set, just written in reverse order.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Options are labeled A to J. Let me list them:

A: [1, -1]

D: [-1, 1]

Ah, so both A and D have the same elements, just different order. So in that case, both are correct? But the options are separate, so perhaps only one is listed as a possible correct answer.

Wait, the question is a multiple-choice, so only one option is correct. Let me make sure.

Wait, the question is phrased as "what are the generators of the additive cyclic group Z?" So the generators are 1 and -1. So the correct answer would be the option that includes both 1 and -1.

Looking at the options, that's option A and option D. But wait, I need to check the options again. Let me look:

Option A: [1, -1]

Option D: [-1, 1]

So they are the same set. But the options are presented as separate choices. Oh wait, perhaps there's a mistake. Because in a multiple-choice question, each option is unique. So I must have misread. Let me check again.

Wait, the user presented the options as:

Options:

A: [1, -1]

B: [1, 0]

C: [0, 2]

D: [-1, 1]

E: [0, 1]

F: [2, 0]

G: [0, -1]

H: [3, -3]

I: [2, -2]

J: [1, 2]

So A is [1,-1], D is [-1,1]. So they are same. Hmm, but this is impossible for a multiple-choice question. So perhaps the correct answer is either A or D, but the question expects only one. Maybe the intended answer is A.

Wait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the question is referring to a generating set, and any set that includes 1 or -1 would suffice. But actually, in group theory, a generating set can be a single element (1) or multiple elements, but in this case, both 1 and -1 generate the group on their own. So any generating set must include at least one of them, but if the set includes both, it's more than necessary.

But the question is phrased as "what are the generators", so perhaps it's looking for all possible generators. Since 1 and -1 are both generators, the set containing both would be the correct answer.

Wait, but wait. The additive cyclic group Z is cyclic of infinite order, so it's isomorphic to the integers. The generators are the elements of infinite order, which in this case are all integers except 0. Wait no, wait. No, that's not correct. Because if you take any integer k not equal to 0, the subgroup it generates is kZ. But only when |k|=1 does k generate the entire group. So, for example, 1 generates Z, 2 generates 2Z, etc. So only 1 and -1 generate the entire group Z.

So the generators of Z are 1 and -1.

Looking at the options, which option includes both 1 and -1? Options A and D. But since it's a multiple-choice question with options A to J, only one option can be correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me think again. Oh wait, perhaps the question is asking for a generating set, which could be either one element (like 1) or a set of elements whose combinations generate the group.

But the options don't have an option with just [1], do they? Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

E: [0,1]

So 0 and 1. But 0 is the identity element, which when added any number of times doesn't change the element. So adding 1 multiple times gives all integers. So including 0 is unnecessary, but the set [0,1] would generate Z because 1 can generate Z on its own. So option E is a generating set as well, but it's not minimal.

Wait, but the question is about the generators of Z. So the generators are the elements that can generate the group. So the minimal generating set is just {1} or {-1}.

But none of the options have [1] alone. Option E has [0,1], which is more than necessary.

Hmm, that complicates things. So perhaps the correct answer is A or D. But according to the options, A and D are the same sets, just written in different orders. That can't be right. So maybe the question has a typo, but assuming it's correct, perhaps the answer is A.

Wait, but the question is phrased as "what are the generators", which could imply the set of all generators. The generators (as elements) are 1 and -1. So the generating set would be {1, -1}.

So the correct option is A or D. But since both are same, perhaps the intended answer is A.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is considering the generators as a set containing both 1 and -1, so the correct option is A.

So the answer should be A.

The additive cyclic group \( \mathbb{Z} \) consists of all integers under addition. A cyclic group is one that can be generated by a single element, and for \( \mathbb{Z} \), the generators are the elements whose multiples (under addition) produce all integers. The only such elements are \( 1 \) and \( -1 \), as any other integer \( k \) would generate a proper subgroup \( k\mathbb{Z} \), not the entire group \( \mathbb{Z} \).

The question asks for the generators of \( \mathbb{Z} \), and the correct generating set is \( \{1, -1\} \). Among the options provided:

- **Option A**: \( [1, -1] \) is correct because it includes both \( 1 \) and \( -1 \), which together generate \( \mathbb{Z} \).
- **Option D**: \( [-1, 1] \) is also correct, as it is the same set as \( \{1, -1\} \), just written in reverse order.

However, since the question is a multiple-choice question with unique options, only one answer can be selected. Assuming no error in the question, the intended answer is **Option A**.

Answer: A
