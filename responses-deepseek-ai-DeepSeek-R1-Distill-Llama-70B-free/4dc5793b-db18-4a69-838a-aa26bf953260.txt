Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the original name of the Apple Macintosh XL computer. Let me think. I remember that Apple had a computer called the Lisa, which was one of their earlier models before the Macintosh. The Lisa was known for being one of the first with a graphical user interface, but it was pretty expensive and didn't sell as well as they hoped.

Wait, I think Apple later rebranded the Lisa. They might have upgraded it and released it under the Macintosh line. Oh right, the Lisa 2 was a thing. But the question is about the Macintosh XL. So maybe the Macintosh XL was actually a rebranded Lisa.

I remember that after the original Lisa, Apple introduced the Lisa 2, which had some improvements. Then, in 1985, Apple decided to market the Lisa 2 as the Macintosh XL. So the Macintosh XL was essentially the Lisa 2 with Macintosh software. That makes sense because Apple was trying to transition their product line to the Macintosh name, which was becoming more popular.

Looking at the options, option G is Lisa 2, and option J is Lisa XL. Wait, the Macintosh XL was previously known as the Lisa 2. So the original name before it was rebranded as Macintosh XL would be Lisa 2. So the answer would be G: Lisa 2.

Alternatively, I'm a bit confused because I've also heard the term Lisa XL before. Maybe the Lisa 2 was sometimes referred to as the Lisa XL? Or perhaps the Macintosh XL was called the Lisa XL internally. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but I think the correct original name before it became Macintosh XL was Lisa 2.

So among the options, G is Lisa 2, which is the correct original name.
