This question refers to the following information.
"MAHATMA GANDHI'S MESSAGE.
REMAIN NON-VIOLENT
The following message was sent by Mahatma Gandhi from Waltair:â€”
Maulana Mohamed AH was arrested at Waltair under sections 107 and 108 to be called upon to give security, to be of good behaviour for one year. The place and date of trial is unknown.
The Begum Saheba and Mr. Hayat were permitted to see him after arrest.
He and I were going to address a meeting outside the station. He was arrested. I continued going to the meeting and addressed them. There is no cause for sorrow, but every cause for congratulation. There should be no hartal. Perfect peace and calmness should be observed. I regard the arrest as a prelude to Swaraj and the redress of the Khilafat and the Punjab wrongs, if we can remain non-violent. Retain Hindu-Muslim Unity despite the madness of some Moplahs, and fulfil the Swadeshi programme.
I hope every Indian, man or woman, will completely boycott foreign cloth and take up spinning or weaving during every spare minute.
By striving like the Maulana, be insistent on religious and national rights.
Let us earn imprisonment. I am conscious of the Maulana's innocence and I am sure the imprisonment of the innocent will enable the nation to reach the cherished goal."
Mohandas Gandhi, The Pilgrims' March, 1921

Okay, I'm trying to answer this question about Mahatma Gandhi's message and its influence. Let me read the question carefully.

The question gives a passage from Gandhi where he emphasizes remaining non-violent. He mentions that the arrest of Maulana Mohamed AH is a prelude to Swaraj, which I remember is self-rule or independence. He also talks about the Khilafat and Punjab wrongs, which I think were significant issues in India at the time, maybe related to British rule. He encourages people to stay calm, no hartal (which is a strike or shutdown), and to focus on non-violent methods. He also mentions boycotting foreign cloth and spinning, which I know is part of the Swadeshi movement to promote self-reliance.

The question is asking which historical development was most likely inspired by his instructions to remain nonviolent. The options are A through D.

Looking at the options:

A: Zionist movement leading to Israel. I know the Zionist movement was more about Jewish nationalism and the creation of Israel. I don't recall Gandhi's methods being a major influence there. Also, the Zionist movement involved some armed conflict, so maybe not non-violent.

B: Independence movements in Southeast Asia. I think many Southeast Asian countries were inspired by Gandhi's non-violent resistance. Countries like Indonesia or Myanmar might have used similar tactics against colonial powers, but I'm not too sure. I remember that India's independence inspired others, but I'm not certain about Southeast Asia specifically.

C: Civil rights movement in the US. This is a strong possibility. I know Martin Luther King Jr. was heavily influenced by Gandhi's non-violent methods. The civil rights movement used sit-ins, marches, and other non-violent protests to challenge segregation and discrimination. So this seems like a direct inspiration.

D: Communist movement in Cuba. The Cuban revolution was led by figures like Fidel Castro and Che Guevara, which was an armed struggle. This doesn't align with Gandhi's non-violence, so probably not.

So the options narrow down to B and C. Now, the question is about the fourth paragraph. Let me check that again. The fourth paragraph is where he says, "I regard the arrest as a prelude to Swaraj and the redress of the Khilafat and Punjab wrongs, if we can remain non-violent." So he's tying non-violence to achieving their goals.

Now, the civil rights movement in the US was indeed inspired by Gandhi. Leaders like MLK studied his methods and applied them in their struggle. That makes sense. On the other hand, while Gandhi's ideas might have influenced some movements in Southeast Asia, I'm not as certain about that being the primary answer here.

Wait, but the question is about the fourth paragraph's instruction. The fourth paragraph is about non-violence leading to Swaraj and other rights. So which movement was inspired by this particular message?

I think the civil rights movement in the US was a big one. So the answer would be option C.

The question asks which historical development was most likely inspired by Mahatma Gandhi's instruction to remain non-violent, as indicated in the fourth paragraph of his message. Gandhi's emphasis on non-violence was a cornerstone of his philosophy and played a significant role in inspiring movements globally. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: The Zionist movement was primarily focused on Jewish nationalism and the creation of Israel, involving armed conflict at times. It does not align with Gandhi's non-violent methods.
- **Option B**: While Gandhi's ideas may have influenced some independence movements in Southeast Asia, the connection is less direct compared to other movements.
- **Option C**: The civil rights movement in the United States, led by figures like Martin Luther King Jr., was heavily influenced by Gandhi's non-violent resistance. King explicitly studied and applied Gandhi's methods in the struggle against segregation and discrimination, making this a strong candidate.
- **Option D**: The communist movement in Cuba, led by Fidel Castro and Che Guevara, involved armed struggle and does not align with Gandhi's non-violent philosophy.

Given the direct inspiration of Gandhi's non-violent methods on the civil rights movement in the U.S., the most likely answer is **C**.

Answer: C
