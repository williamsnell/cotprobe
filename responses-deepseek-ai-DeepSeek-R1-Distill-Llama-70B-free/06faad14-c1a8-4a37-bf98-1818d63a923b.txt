Okay, so I've got this Laplace transform problem to solve. The function given is F(s) = (2s² - 4) / [(s - 2)(s + 1)(s - 3)]. I need to find its inverse Laplace transform, which means I have to break it down into partial fractions and then match each term to known Laplace transforms.

Hmm, let me remember how partial fraction decomposition works. Since the denominator factors are all linear and distinct, I can express F(s) as A/(s-2) + B/(s+1) + C/(s-3). So, I'll set up the equation:

(2s² - 4) / [(s-2)(s+1)(s-3)] = A/(s-2) + B/(s+1) + C/(s-3)

To find A, B, and C, I'll multiply both sides by the denominator to eliminate the fractions. That gives me:

2s² - 4 = A(s+1)(s-3) + B(s-2)(s-3) + C(s-2)(s+1)

Now, I can find each constant by plugging in suitable values of s. Let's see:

1. Let s = 2: Then, the equation becomes 2*(2)^2 -4 = A(2+1)(2-3). So 8-4= A*(3)(-1) → 4 = -3A → A = -4/3.

2. Let s = -1: Plugging in, 2*(-1)^2 -4 = B(-1-2)(-1-3) → 2*1 -4 = B*(-3)(-4) → (2-4)=12B → -2=12B → B = -2/12 = -1/6.

3. Let s =3: 2*(3)^2 -4 = C(3-2)(3+1) → 18-4 = C*(1)(4) → 14=4C → C=14/4 =7/2.

So now I have A=-4/3, B=-1/6, C=7/2.

So F(s) can be written as:

(-4/3)/(s-2) + (-1/6)/(s+1) + (7/2)/(s-3)

Wait, wait. Let me check the signs. The denominators are (s-2), (s+1), (s-3). So when writing each term:

A/(s-2) → (-4/3)/(s-2) → which is (-4/3) * 1/(s-2)

Similarly for B and C.

Now, the inverse Laplace transform of 1/(s-a) is e^{at} u(t), where u(t) is the unit step function. Assuming we're considering t ≥ 0, u(t) is 1.

So taking the inverse Laplace term by term:

- (-4/3) * e^{2t} → because 1/(s-2) → e^{2t}
- (-1/6) * e^{-t} → because 1/(s+1) =1/(s - (-1)) → e^{-t}
- (7/2) * e^{3t} → because 1/(s-3) → e^{3t}

Putting it all together:

f(t) = (-4/3)e^{2t} - (1/6)e^{-t} + (7/2)e^{3t}

Now, let me look at the options. Let's scan through them:

Option B: [(-4)/3]e^2t - (1/6)e^-t - (7/2)e^3t → No, because the last term is negative.

Option E: [(-4)/3]e^2t + (1/6)e^t - (7/2)e^3t → Second term is e^t, not e^-t. So wrong.

Option F: [(-4)/3]e^2t - (1/6)e^-t + (7/2)e^3t → Yes, this matches.

Option H: [(-4)/3]e^2t - (1/6)e^t + (7/2)e^3t → Second term is e^t, not e^-t.

So the correct option is F.

To find the inverse Laplace transform of \( F(s) = \frac{2s^2 - 4}{(s - 2)(s + 1)(s - 3)} \), we perform partial fraction decomposition. The function can be expressed as:

\[
F(s) = \frac{A}{s - 2} + \frac{B}{s + 1} + \frac{C}{s - 3}
\]

Multiplying through by the denominator \((s - 2)(s + 1)(s - 3)\) and solving for \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) by substituting suitable values of \(s\):

1. Let \(s = 2\):  
   \[
   2(2)^2 - 4 = A(2 + 1)(2 - 3) \implies 4 = -3A \implies A = -\frac{4}{3}
   \]

2. Let \(s = -1\):  
   \[
   2(-1)^2 - 4 = B(-1 - 2)(-1 - 3) \implies -2 = 12B \implies B = -\frac{1}{6}
   \]

3. Let \(s = 3\):  
   \[
   2(3)^2 - 4 = C(3 - 2)(3 + 1) \implies 14 = 4C \implies C = \frac{7}{2}
   \]

Thus, the partial fraction decomposition is:

\[
F(s) = \frac{-\frac{4}{3}}{s - 2} + \frac{-\frac{1}{6}}{s + 1} + \frac{\frac{7}{2}}{s - 3}
\]

Taking the inverse Laplace transform term by term:

- \(\frac{-\frac{4}{3}}{s - 2} \implies -\frac{4}{3}e^{2t}\)
- \(\frac{-\frac{1}{6}}{s + 1} \implies -\frac{1}{6}e^{-t}\)
- \(\frac{\frac{7}{2}}{s - 3} \implies \frac{7}{2}e^{3t}\)

Combining these, the inverse Laplace transform is:

\[
f(t) = -\frac{4}{3}e^{2t} - \frac{1}{6}e^{-t} + \frac{7}{2}e^{3t}
\]

Comparing with the options, the correct match is:

**Option F: \( f(t) = -\frac{4}{3}e^{2t} - \frac{1}{6}e^{-t} + \frac{7}{2}e^{3t} \)**.
