Okay, so I've got this problem about pressure changes in a tank when the temperature increases. Hmm, I think it's related to gas laws. Let me try to remember what I learned in class.

The problem says the initial pressure is 640 mm of Hg at 23°C. Then the temperature rises to 48°C, and we need to find the new pressure. Oh right, this sounds like Charles's Law or Gay-Lussac's Law. Wait, Gay-Lussac's Law deals with pressure and temperature changes when volume is constant, right? Because the tank's volume isn't changing, so the pressure should change with temperature.

Gay-Lussac's Law is P1/T1 = P2/T2, but wait, I think the temperatures need to be in Kelvin. Oh yeah, because gas laws require absolute temperatures. So I'll have to convert Celsius to Kelvin.

Let me jot down the given values. P1 is 640 mm Hg. T1 is 23°C, which is 23 + 273.15 = 296.15 K. T2 is 48°C, so 48 + 273.15 = 321.15 K.

So applying the formula: P2 = P1 * (T2 / T1). Plugging in the numbers: P2 = 640 * (321.15 / 296.15).

Let me calculate that. First, what's 321.15 divided by 296.15? Let's approximate. Let me see, 321 / 296 is about 1.0848. Wait, wait, maybe a more precise calculation.

321.15 divided by 296.15 equals approximately 1.0848. So then 640 multiplied by 1.0848.

640 * 1 is 640, 640 * 0.08 is 51.2, and 640 * 0.0048 is about 3.072. Adding those together: 640 + 51.2 = 691.2, plus 3.072 is 694.272. So around 694 mm Hg.

Looking at the options, option A is 694 mm of Hg. That must be the answer. But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Wait, another way to calculate the ratio: 321.15 / 296.15. Let me compute this accurately. 296.15 times 1.08 is 296.15 * 1 = 296.15, 296.15 * 0.08 = 23.692. So 296.15 + 23.692 = 319.842, which is close to 321.15. Hmm, so maybe the ratio is a little higher than 1.08. Let me compute 321.15 / 296.15.

Let me do it step by step. 321.15 ÷ 296.15. Let's see: 296.15 * 1.08 is 319.842. The difference is 321.15 - 319.842 = 1.308. So how much more than 1.08 is that?

So 1.308 / 296.15 ≈ 0.004415. So the ratio is approximately 1.084415. So about 1.0844.

So 640 * 1.0844. Let's compute that. 640 * 1 =640. 640 * 0.08=51.2. 640 * 0.0044=2.816. So 640 +51.2=691.2, plus 2.816 is 694.016. So approximately 694.0 mm Hg.

Yes, so the correct answer is A: 694 mm of Hg.

To solve the problem, we use Gay-Lussac's Law, which states that \( \frac{P_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2}{T_2} \), where \( P \) is pressure and \( T \) is temperature in Kelvin. The tank's volume is constant, so this law applies. 

### Given:
- Initial pressure, \( P_1 = 640 \, \text{mm Hg} \)
- Initial temperature, \( T_1 = 23^\circ \text{C} = 23 + 273.15 = 296.15 \, \text{K} \)
- Final temperature, \( T_2 = 48^\circ \text{C} = 48 + 273.15 = 321.15 \, \text{K} \)

### Step 1: Rearrange Gay-Lussac's Law to solve for \( P_2 \):
\[
P_2 = P_1 \cdot \frac{T_2}{T_1}
\]

### Step 2: Substitute the values:
\[
P_2 = 640 \cdot \frac{321.15}{296.15}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the ratio \( \frac{T_2}{T_1} \):
\[
\frac{321.15}{296.15} \approx 1.0844
\]

### Step 4: Multiply to find \( P_2 \):
\[
P_2 = 640 \cdot 1.0844 \approx 694.0 \, \text{mm Hg}
\]

### Final Answer:
The pressure in the tank after the temperature increase is approximately **694 mm of Hg**, which corresponds to option **A**.
