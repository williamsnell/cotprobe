Okay, so I've got this communication systems problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem gives me a signal h(t) = 10 cos(10^6 t + 200 sin 500t). I need to determine three things: the bandwidth (BW) of h(t), the modulating signal m(t) if h(t) is an FM signal, and m(t) if it's a phase-modulated wave. The options are from A to J.

First, I remember that in communication systems, signals can be modulated in different ways, like amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), and phase modulation (PM). Each has its own characteristics and formulas.

Looking at h(t), it's written in terms of cosine, which usually represents the carrier wave. The general form for an FM or PM signal is something like cos(ω_c t + β m(t)), where ω_c is the carrier frequency, and β is some modulation index. Wait, but for FM, the expression inside the cosine is θ(t) = ω_c t + β ∫m(t) dt, right? Or is that for PM? Hmm, I'm a bit confused here.

Wait, no. Let me think again. For phase modulation, the phase is directly proportional to the modulating signal. So the general form is:

s(t) = A cos(ω_c t + φ(t)) 

where φ(t) = k_p m(t). So the phase is directly the modulating signal multiplied by a constant k_p.

For frequency modulation, the phase is the integral of the modulating signal. So it's:

s(t) = A cos(ω_c t + ∫ m(t) dt + φ_0 )

Wait, no, more accurately, for FM, the instantaneous frequency is the derivative of the phase. So the phase would be the integral of the modulating signal multiplied by some factor. Let me get the exact expressions right.

FM: The carrier is varied in frequency according to the modulating signal. So the time-varying phase is given by θ(t) = ω_c t + β ∫ m(t) dt. Wait, or is the phase θ(t) = ω_c t + β m(t)? No, I think FM involves the integral because frequency is the derivative of phase. So if m(t) is the modulating signal, the instantaneous frequency is ω_c + β m(t). So integrating that, the phase would be ∫ (ω_c + β m(t)) dt = ω_c t + β ∫ m(t) dt. So θ(t) = ω_c t + β ∫ m(t) dt. So in the cosine, the argument is θ(t).

Similarly, for PM, the phase is directly proportional to m(t), so θ(t) = ω_c t + β m(t) + φ_0, maybe, but I'll ignore the initial phase φ_0.

So looking back at h(t), it's 10 cos(10^6 t + 200 sin 500t). So the argument is (10^6 t) + (200 sin 500t). Hmm. So comparing to FM and PM:

For FM: θ(t) = ω_c t + β ∫ m(t) dt → So the varying part is ∫ m(t) dt. So in h(t), the varying part is 200 sin(500t). So if it's FM, then 200 sin(500t) should be the integral of m(t) multiplied by some β. But wait, that would mean that m(t) is the derivative of 200 sin(500t), which is 200*500 cos(500t). But wait, that doesn't seem to match the answer options, or maybe it does? Let me check the options later.

Wait, but alternatively, suppose h(t) is a PM signal. Then the varying term is directly proportional to m(t). So 200 sin(500t) would be equal to β m(t). So m(t) would be (200/β) sin(500t). But without knowing β, I can't say exactly, but maybe the options will give me a clue.

Wait, but the problem states that h(t) is an FM signal in part b) and a PM in part c). So for each part, I have to consider h(t) as FM and PM respectively.

Wait, but in the given h(t), the phase term is 10^6 t + 200 sin(500t). So the varying part is 200 sin(500t). So if it's FM, then the varying part is proportional to the integral of m(t), and if it's PM, it's proportional to m(t) directly.

So for part a), the bandwidth. Hmm. For FM signals, the bandwidth is determined by the maximum frequency deviation and the maximum frequency of the modulating signal. The formula for FM bandwidth is BW = 2(Δf + f_m), where Δf is the maximum frequency deviation, and f_m is the highest frequency in m(t). But wait, isn't it more accurately given by the Carson's rule? Carson's rule states that the bandwidth is approximately 2(β + 1) times the bandwidth of the modulating signal. Or sometimes it's 2Δf_max + 2f_m, where f_m is the highest frequency in m(t). Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the maximum and minimum frequencies.

Wait, let's get this straight. For FM, the carrier frequency is ω_c, and the modulating signal causes the frequency to vary. The maximum frequency deviation is Δf. So the highest frequency would be ω_c + 2πΔf, and the lowest would be ω_c - 2πΔf. So the bandwidth is (ω_c + 2πΔf) - (ω_c - 2πΔf) ) = 4πΔf. But wait, that would be the range from the lowest to highest frequency. But wait, in communication systems, the bandwidth is usually the range occupied by the signal, so for an FM signal, the BW is roughly twice the sum of the maximum frequency deviation and the highest frequency component of the modulating signal. So BW = 2(Δf + f_m). Or maybe it's 2(Δf + W), where W is the bandwidth of m(t). Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, the formula I remember is BW = 2(β W + W), where W is the bandwidth of m(t), and β is the modulation index. But β is Δf / f_m, I think. Hmm. 

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the specific case given. The given h(t) is 10 cos(10^6 t + 200 sin500t). If we're treating this as an FM signal, then the argument inside the cosine is the time-varying phase. So for FM, the phase is θ(t) = ω_c t + β ∫ m(t) dt. Comparing to h(t), the phase is 10^6 t + 200 sin500t.

Wait, so 200 sin500t would be β times the integral of m(t). Let me write this as:

200 sin(500t) = β ∫ m(t) dt

So taking derivative on both sides:

d/dt [200 sin(500t)] = β m(t)

200 * 500 cos(500t) = β m(t)

So m(t) = (200 * 500 / β) cos(500t)

Hmm, but I don't know β. But maybe I can find β from the original expression. Wait, in FM, the modulation index is β = Δf / f_m, where Δf is the maximum frequency deviation, and f_m is the highest frequency component in m(t).

Wait, but maybe the 200 factor is β times something. Let me think again.

Wait, the standard form for an FM signal is:

s(t) = A cos(ω_c t + β ∫ m(t) dt )

So in our case, the varying phase term is 200 sin500t. So that would be β ∫ m(t) dt = 200 sin500t. 

Taking the derivative, β m(t) = 200 * 500 cos500t → m(t) = (200 * 500 / β) cos500t.

But without knowing β, I can't directly get m(t). Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps the amplitude of the sine term in the phase is β times the amplitude of the integral of m(t). Wait, maybe I'm complicating this. Let me think about the options.

Looking at the options, let's see. For part b), the modulating signal for FM is either 2 sin500t, cos500t, sin1000t, etc. So if m(t) is a cosine function, then perhaps the integral of m(t) is a sine function. Wait, yes. So if m(t) is cos500t, then ∫ m(t) dt would be (1/500) sin500t.

So in the phase term for FM, we have β ∫ m(t) dt. So if that equals 200 sin500t, then β*(1/500) sin500t = 200 sin500t → β*(1/500) = 200 → β = 200 * 500 = 1e5. Wait, 200 * 500 is 100,000. So β is 1e5.

But that's a very high modulation index. Does that make sense? Wait, but in the options, the modulating signal for FM in option D is cos500t. So let's check that.

If m(t) is cos500t, then ∫ m(t) dt = (1/500) sin500t. So β times that would be (β/500) sin500t. Comparing to the given phase term, which is 200 sin500t, so (β/500) = 200 → β = 200 * 500 = 100,000. So that would make β=1e5, which is a very high modulation index, but possible.

So then the modulating signal for FM would be m(t) = cos500t, which is option D or F or others. Let me check the options.

Looking at the options:

Option D: BW ~64 kHz, FM m(t)=cos500t, PM m(t)=sin500t.

Option F: BW ~32 kHz, FM m(t)=cos500t, PM m(t)=sin500t.

Hmm. So if m(t) is cos500t, then for FM, the modulating signal would be that.

Now, for the bandwidth of the FM signal. The formula for FM bandwidth is approximately 2(Δf + W), where W is the bandwidth of the modulating signal. Wait, but what's W here?

Wait, the modulating signal is m(t) = cos500t, which is a single frequency at 500 Hz. So W, the bandwidth, would be zero, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing terms. The bandwidth of the modulating signal when it's a single sinusoid is considered as 2f_m, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the highest frequency component in m(t) is 500 Hz, so f_m =500 Hz.

Wait, but in any case, for an FM signal with a single tone modulating signal, the bandwidth is 2*(β +1)*f_m. Or wait, Carson's rule says that the bandwidth is approximately 2Δf + 2f_m. Because Δf is the maximum frequency deviation, and f_m is the maximum frequency in the modulating signal.

Wait, but in our case, let's compute Δf. Since the modulating signal is m(t) = cos500t, and the modulation index β is Δf / f_m. Wait, β is the ratio of the maximum frequency deviation to the modulating frequency. So Δf = β * f_m.

So in our case, f_m is 500 Hz, and β is 1e5. So Δf = 1e5 *500 Hz = 5e7 Hz, which is 50 MHz. That's a huge frequency deviation. Then the bandwidth would be 2*(Δf + f_m) = 2*(50e6 + 500) ≈ 100e6 Hz=100 MHz. But looking at the options, none of them have 100 MHz as the bandwidth. So I must be making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the modulation index. Let's go back. The phase term for FM is θ(t) = ω_c t + β ∫ m(t) dt. The maximum value of ∫ m(t) dt occurs when m(t) is at its peak. Since m(t) is cos500t, its integral is (1/500) sin500t, which has a maximum amplitude of 1/500. So β times that would be (β/500). So the maximum phase deviation is (β/500). But in our case, the phase term is 200 sin500t, so the maximum phase deviation is 200. So β/500 = 200 → β=100,000. 

But for FM, the modulation index is β_fm = Δf / f_m. So Δf = β_fm * f_m. So Δf = 1e5 *500 Hz = 5e7 Hz=50 MHz. So the maximum frequency deviation is 50 MHz. 

Then the bandwidth of the FM signal is 2*(Δf + f_m) = 2*(50e6 +500) ≈100e6 Hz=100 MHz. But none of the options have 100 MHz as the bandwidth. Wait, looking at the options:

Option B: Bandwidth ~32 MHz.

Option E: BW ~32 MHz.

Option I: BW ~1 MHz.

Hmmm. So maybe I'm using the wrong approach. Alternatively, perhaps the signal is a narrowband FM, but that's when the modulation index is small, which it's not in this case.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the Carson's rule, which says that the bandwidth is approximately 2(β +1)*f_m. But if β is 1e5 and f_m is 500 Hz, then that would give BW=2*(1e5 +1)*500 ≈ 2e5 *500 =1e8 Hz=100 MHz, same as before.

But none of the options have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the modulation. Maybe the given h(t) is a phase-modulated signal, not FM. Let me try that.

If h(t) is phase-modulated, then the varying term in the phase is directly proportional to m(t). So 200 sin500t = β m(t). So m(t) = (200/β) sin500t. But without knowing β, I can't find m(t) exactly, but perhaps from the options, m(t) would be sin500t, so 200/β would be the amplitude. But in the options, for PM, m(t) is either sin500t or cos500t.

Wait, let's check the options again. Option D says for PM, m(t) is sin500t. Option F says for PM, m(t) is sin500t as well. Option A says PM is 2 cos500t.

Wait, but let's first think about the bandwidth for each case.

If h(t) is an FM signal, the BW is 100 MHz as I computed earlier, but that's not an option. So maybe the question is considering something else, perhaps I've misread the problem.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the bandwidth differently. The given h(t) is 10 cos(1e6 t + 200 sin500t). So the carrier frequency is 1e6 Hz, which is 1 MHz. The modulating signal inside is 200 sin500t. So for FM, the maximum frequency deviation Δf is 200 * 500 / (2π)? Wait, no, wait. Wait, in FM, the maximum frequency deviation is given by the maximum change in the argument of the cosine. Wait, the phase is varying as 200 sin500t. The instantaneous frequency is the derivative of the phase with respect to time. So the instantaneous frequency ω(t) is 1e6 + d/dt [200 sin500t] = 1e6 + 200*500 cos500t = 1e6 + 1e5 cos500t. So the maximum frequency is 1e6 +1e5=1.1e6 rad/s? Wait, no, wait. Wait, 1e6 is in radians per second because it's ω=2πf. Wait no, 1e6 t is in radians, so f_c is 1e6/(2π) Hz.

Wait, I'm getting confused between angular frequency and Hz. Let me clarify.

The general form of the carrier is cos(ω_c t + ... ), where ω_c is the angular frequency, which is 2π f_c. So in h(t), the carrier term is 1e6 t, so ω_c =1e6 rad/s. Therefore, f_c = ω_c/(2π) ≈ 159.15 kHz.

Now, the varying part is 200 sin500t. So the instantaneous frequency is the derivative of the entire phase. So ω(t) = d/dt [1e6 t + 200 sin500t] = 1e6 + 200*500 cos500t = 1e6 + 1e5 cos500t.

So the maximum frequency deviation is 1e5 rad/s, which is about 1e5/(2π) ≈15.915 kHz. So Δf =15.915 kHz.

Now, the modulating signal is at 500 Hz, so f_m=500 Hz.

Using Carson's rule, the bandwidth BW is 2*(Δf + f_m). But wait, that would be 2*(15.915e3 + 0.5e3) = 2*(16.415e3)≈32.83 kHz. So approximately 32.8 kHz, which is close to 32 kHz. So the bandwidth would be about 32 kHz. Looking at the options, let's see which ones have a BW of 32 kHz.

Looking at the options:

Option F: BW ~32 kHz, FM modulating signal is cos500t, PM is sin500t.

Option H: BW ~32 kHz, FM modulating signal is sin500t, PM is cos500t.

Option D: BW ~64 kHz, so that's double.

Option B, E, I, J: BW in MHz, which seems too high.

So based on this, the correct BW is approximately 32 kHz.

So part a) is 32 kHz, which matches options F, H, and others.

Now, part b) asks for the modulating signal if h(t) is FM. From earlier, we found that for FM, m(t) is cos500t, because the integral of cos500t is (1/500) sin500t, and when multiplied by β, gives the 200 sin500t term.

Wait
