Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about criminal law, specifically about the crime of solicitation. I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking which of the options does not apply to solicitation. The options are A through E, and I need to figure out which one is incorrect regarding solicitation.

First, I'll try to recall what I know about solicitation. From what I remember, solicitation is when someone tries to get another person to commit a crime. It's like asking or encouraging someone to do something illegal. But I think the exact elements might vary by jurisdiction, so I should keep that in mind.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Withdrawal is generally not a defense. Hmm, I think in some crimes, if you withdraw before the crime happens, you might have a defense. For example, in conspiracy, if you withdraw before the crime is committed, you might not be liable. But does that apply to solicitation? I'm not too sure. Maybe for solicitation, even if you take it back, the act of soliciting has already happened, so withdrawal doesn't help. So A might be correct, meaning it applies to solicitation, so it's not the answer we're looking for.

Option B: It is an agreement between two or more to commit a crime. Wait, that sounds more like conspiracy. Conspiracy requires an agreement between two or more people to commit a crime. Solicitation is just one person asking another to commit a crime, not necessarily an agreement. So B might not apply to solicitation. That could be the answer, but I need to check the others.

Option C: It is not considered a crime in some jurisdictions. I think that's true. Laws vary, and some places might not criminalize solicitation, especially for certain types of crimes. For example, maybe in some jurisdictions, solicitation to commit a misdemeanor isn't a crime, but for felonies it is. So C applies, meaning it's a correct statement about solicitation, so not the answer.

Option D: It is solicitation of another to commit a felony. I believe that in many places, solicitation to commit a felony is a crime, but maybe for misdemeanors, it's not. So D would apply, making it a correct statement, so not the answer.

Option E: No act is needed other than the solicitation. That makes sense because solicitation is about the attempt or the asking. You don't need the other person to actually commit the crime; the act of soliciting is enough. So E applies, correct statement, not the answer.

So the question is which does NOT apply. Based on this, Option B seems incorrect because solicitation doesn't require an agreement between two or more. That's more like conspiracy. So the answer should be B.

The question asks which option does not apply to the crime of solicitation. Solicitation involves one person asking another to commit a crime, and it does not require an agreement between parties. Conspiracy, not solicitation, involves an agreement. Therefore, the correct answer is:

B

Answer: B
