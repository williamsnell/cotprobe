Okay, so I've got this calculus problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I don't remember all the steps perfectly, but I'll try to think it through. The question is about finding the Laplacian of a function u, which is given as the arctangent of y over x. So u = arctan(y/x). The Laplacian is the sum of the second partial derivatives with respect to x and y. I remember that the Laplacian of a function is a fundamental concept in various areas of physics, like electromagnetism and fluid dynamics.

First, I need to find the second partial derivatives of u with respect to x and y. Let me break it down step by step. 

Starting with the first partial derivative of u with respect to x. Since u is arctan(y/x), I think I should use the derivative of arctan(z) where z is a function of x and y. The derivative of arctan(z) with respect to z is 1/(1 + z²). So applying the chain rule, the partial derivative with respect to x would be (1/(1 + (y/x)^2)) multiplied by the derivative of (y/x) with respect to x.

Wait, (y/x) is the argument. So let me compute that. The derivative of (y/x) with respect to x is (0 * x - y * 1)/x², which simplifies to -y/x². So putting it all together, the first partial derivative ∂u/∂x is [1/(1 + (y²/x²))] * (-y/x²).

Simplify this expression. 1 + (y²/x²) is (x² + y²)/x², so the reciprocal would be x²/(x² + y²). So substituting back, ∂u/∂x becomes (x²/(x² + y²)) * (-y/x²) ) which simplifies to -y/(x² + y²).

Now, I need the second partial derivative. So take the derivative of ∂u/∂x with respect to x again. So ∂²u/∂x² is the derivative of (-y/(x² + y²)) with respect to x.

Let me compute that. Let me denote the denominator as D = x² + y². So the function is -y/D. The derivative of this with respect to x is (0 * D - (-y) * 2x) / D². Wait, no, because the derivative of D with respect to x is 2x. So applying the quotient rule: [0 * D - (-y) * (2x)] / D². Wait, no, perhaps I should think it again.

Wait, the function is -y/D. So the derivative is [-y * d/dx (1/D)] because -y is a constant with respect to x. So d/dx (1/D) is -D^(-2) * dD/dx. dD/dx is 2x. So putting it together: (-y) * [ - (2x) / D² ] = (2xy) / D². So ∂²u/∂x² is (2xy)/(x² + y²)^2.

Wait, let me make sure. Let's compute it step by step. Let f(x) = -y/(x² + y²). Then f'(x) is [0*(x² + y²) - (-y)*(2x)] / (x² + y²)^2. That is, [0 + 2xy] / (denominator squared). So yes, ∂²u/∂x² is 2xy/(x² + y²)^2.

Now, moving on to the partial derivative with respect to y. So first, compute ∂u/∂y. Again, u is arctan(y/x), so the derivative of arctan(z) is 1/(1 + z²) times dz/dy. Here, z is y/x, so dz/dy is 1/x. So ∂u/∂y is [1/(1 + (y/x)^2)] * (1/x).

Simplify this. 1 + (y^2/x^2) is (x² + y²)/x², so reciprocal is x²/(x² + y²). So substituting, ∂u/∂y becomes [x²/(x² + y²)] * (1/x) )= x/(x² + y²).

Now, take the second partial derivative with respect to y. So ∂²u/∂y² is the derivative of [x/(x² + y²)] with respect to y.

Again, using the quotient rule. Let me denote D = x² + y². The function is x/D. So derivative is (0 * D - x * dD/dy) / D². dD/dy is 2y. So this becomes (-x * 2y) / D² = (-2xy)/(x² + y²)^2.

Wait, let me double-check. f(y) = x/(x² + y²). So f'(y) is [0*(x² + y²) - x*(2y)] / (x² + y²)^2. So yes, that's (-2xy)/(x² + y²)^2. So ∂²u/∂y² is (-2xy)/(x² + y²)^2.

Now, the Laplacian is the sum of ∂²u/∂x² and ∂²u/∂y². So adding them together:

∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y² = [2xy/(x² + y²)^2] + [(-2xy)/(x² + y²)^2] = (2xy - 2xy)/(x² + y²)^2) = 0.

Wait, that can't be right. Because I thought the Laplacian of arctan(y/x) might be something else. But according to this, it's zero. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me see. Another approach: Maybe I can recall that the Laplacian in polar coordinates might be easier for this function. Because arctan(y/x) is the θ in polar coordinates. So u = θ.

In polar coordinates, the Laplacian is (1/r²)(d²u/dr²) + (1/r)(du/dr) + (1/r²)(d²u/dθ²). But θ is a function of r and θ, but in this case, u=θ. So let's compute the Laplacian of u=θ.

Compute each term:

d²u/dr² = 0 because u doesn't depend on r.

du/dr = 0 for the same reason.

d²u/dθ² = 0 because the second derivative of θ with respect to θ is zero.

So the Laplacian would be zero. But wait, that's in polar coordinates. However, in Cartesian coordinates, does this hold? Wait, no, because the transformation from Cartesian to polar affects the Laplacian operator. Wait, but the function u=θ in polar coordinates, its Laplacian in Cartesian should be the same as in polar? Because the Laplacian is a scalar operator, so it should represent the same physical quantity regardless of coordinate system.

Wait, but I thought that for harmonic functions, the Laplacian is zero. But is arctan(y/x) a harmonic function? Because that's what this seems to suggest.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about whether u=arctan(y/x) satisfies Laplace's equation. Let me think. If I'm not mistaken, in two dimensions, the function arctan(y/x) is harmonic except at the origin, because its Laplacian is zero everywhere except at (0,0), where it's singular.

Wait, but according to my earlier calculations, the Laplacian in Cartesian coordinates was zero. So that would mean the correct answer is 0.0, which is option D.

But wait, in that case, what's the catch? Because the Laplacian of θ in polar is zero only when considering the appropriate terms. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the Cartesian calculation.

Wait, let me recheck the derivatives.

First, ∂u/∂x was -y/(x² + y²). Then ∂²u/∂x² is 2xy/(x² + y²)^2. Correct.

∂u/∂y was x/(x² + y²). Then ∂²u/∂y² is (-2xy)/(x² + y²)^2. So when adding ∂²u/∂x² + ∂²u/∂y², it's (2xy - 2xy)/(x² + y²)^2 = 0.

So according to this, the Laplacian is zero. So the answer should be D: 0.0.

But wait, I seem to remember that the Laplacian of arctan(y/x) is not zero. Or am I confusing it with something else? Let me think about the Laplacian in polar coordinates again.

In polar coordinates, u = θ. So let's compute the Laplacian of u in polar coordinates. The Laplacian operator in polar coordinates is (1/r)(d/dr)(r du/dr) + (1/r²) d²u/dθ².

So for u=θ, du/dr = 0, since θ is independent of r. So the first term is zero. The second term is (1/r²) times d²θ/dθ², which is zero. So yes, the Laplacian is zero in polar, which suggests that it's zero in Cartesian as well.

So the Laplacian of u is zero, making the correct answer D: 0.0.

I think I'm confident now. So the answer is D.

To solve the problem, we need to compute the Laplacian of the function \( u = \arctan\left(\frac{y}{x}\right) \), which is defined as:

\[
\nabla^2 u = \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2}.
\]

### Step 1: Compute \( \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \)
Using the chain rule, the first partial derivative of \( u \) with respect to \( x \) is:

\[
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac{1}{1 + \left(\frac{y}{x}\right)^2} \cdot \left(-\frac{y}{x^2}\right).
\]

Simplifying \( 1 + \left(\frac{y}{x}\right)^2 = \frac{x^2 + y^2}{x^2} \), we get:

\[
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac{x^2}{x^2 + y^2} \cdot \left(-\frac{y}{x^2}\right) = -\frac{y}{x^2 + y^2}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \( \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} \)
Taking the derivative of \( \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = -\frac{y}{x^2 + y^2} \) with respect to \( x \), we apply the quotient rule:

\[
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} = \frac{0 \cdot (x^2 + y^2) - (-y) \cdot 2x}{(x^2 + y^2)^2} = \frac{2xy}{(x^2 + y^2)^2}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute \( \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} \)
Using the chain rule, the first partial derivative of \( u \) with respect to \( y \) is:

\[
\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = \frac{1}{1 + \left(\frac{y}{x}\right)^2} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{x}\right).
\]

Simplifying \( 1 + \left(\frac{y}{x}\right)^2 = \frac{x^2 + y^2}{x^2} \), we get:

\[
\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = \frac{x^2}{x^2 + y^2} \cdot \frac{1}{x} = \frac{x}{x^2 + y^2}.
\]

### Step 4: Compute \( \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} \)
Taking the derivative of \( \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = \frac{x}{x^2 + y^2} \) with respect to \( y \), we apply the quotient rule:

\[
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} = \frac{0 \cdot (x^2 + y^2) - x \cdot 2y}{(x^2 + y^2)^2} = -\frac{2xy}{(x^2 + y^2)^2}.
\]

### Step 5: Compute the Laplacian
The Laplacian is the sum of the second partial derivatives:

\[
\nabla^2 u = \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} = \frac{2xy}{(x^2 + y^2)^2} + \left(-\frac{2xy}{(x^2 + y^2)^2}\right).
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\nabla^2 u = \frac{2xy - 2xy}{(x^2 + y^2)^2} = 0.
\]

### Conclusion
The Laplacian of \( u = \arctan\left(\frac{y}{x}\right) \) is zero. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**D: 0.0**
