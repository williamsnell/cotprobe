Alright, so I've got this question about a famous line from the existentialist play 'No Exit'. The question is asking what hell is according to that play. The options are from A to J.

Okay, I remember that 'No Exit' is a play by Jean-Paul Sartre. Sartre was a big name in existentialism, so I'm pretty sure the concept of hell here is more philosophical than the traditional religious view.

In the play, the main characters are stuck in a room together. I think the setup is that they're in some kind of afterlife situation, but it's not the typical hell with fire and brimstone. Instead, the hell is more about their interaction with each other.

Wait, there's a famous line from the play. I think it's something like "Hell is other people." Yeah, that rings a bell. So the idea is that being trapped with others, having to deal with their judgments and company, is a form of torment. So hell isn't a place but more about the presence of others.

Looking at the options, option E is "other people". That must be the correct answer. Let me double-check the other options to be sure.

Option A is fire and brimstone, which is the traditional view but not what Sartre is saying here. Option C says a state of mind, which is somewhat related but not as specific. Option J is oneself, but I think the quote is about others, not oneself. Option F is eternal loneliness, but in the play, they're together, so it's the oppositeâ€”hell is having others around, not being alone.

So yeah, the answer should be E.

The correct answer is based on the famous line from Jean-Paul Sartre's play 'No Exit', which states, "Hell is other people." This reflects the existentialist idea that the presence of others and their judgments can be a form of torment.

E: other people

Answer: E
