Okay, so I've got this problem here about a watch's list price and net price, and I need to find the percentage discount. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. 

Alright, the list price is $300, and the net price is $174. So the discount must be the difference between the list and net price, right? Because the discount is what's taken off the original price to get the net price. 

Let me calculate that first. The list price is 300, so subtracting the net price of 174 from that should give me the discount amount. Let me do the math: 300 minus 174. Hmm, 300 minus 170 is 130, and then minus 4 more is 126. So the discount is $126.

Now, to find the percentage discount, I think I need to compare the discount amount to the original list price. So that would be (discount / list price) * 100 to get the percentage. 

Plugging in the numbers, that's 126 divided by 300. Let me calculate that. 126 divided by 300. Well, 300 divided by 3 is 100, so 126 divided by 3 is 42. So 42 divided by 100 is 0.42. Wait, no, wait. Wait, 126/300. Let me think again. 300 goes into 126 zero times, but maybe I should simplify the fraction. 

Alternatively, I can divide both numerator and denominator by 6. 126 รท6 is 21, and 300 รท6 is 50. So 21/50 is 0.42. Oh, right, so 0.42 times 100 gives 42%. So the discount is 42%.

Looking at the options, option B is 42%, so that should be the correct answer. 

Wait, did I do everything right? Let me double-check. The discount is list minus net: 300 - 174 = 126. Then (126 / 300)*100 = 42%. Yeah, that makes sense. So yeah, option B is correct.

The discount amount is calculated as the difference between the list price and the net price:  
\[
\text{Discount} = \$300 - \$174 = \$126
\]  
To find the percentage discount, divide the discount by the list price and multiply by 100:  
\[
\text{Percentage Discount} = \left(\frac{\$126}{\$300}\right) \times 100 = 42\%
\]  
Thus, the correct answer is **B: 42%**.
