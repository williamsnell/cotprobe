Question:

What is meant by the term tonus, or tone?

Options:

A: Tonus refers to the electrical activity in the brain during relaxation.
B: Tonus refers to the maximum force a muscle can exert in a single effort.
C: Tonus refers to the flexibility and range of motion in joints and muscles.
D: Tonus refers to the state of complete relaxation in skeletal muscles.
E: Tonus refers to the involuntary contraction of smooth muscles in the digestive tract.
F: Tonus refers to the state of sustained partial contraction present in skeletal muscles as long as the nerves to the muscle are intact.
G: Tonus refers to the rhythmic contraction and relaxation of the heart muscle.
H: Tonus refers to the capacity of muscles to respond to stimuli without conscious effort.
I: Tonus refers to the state of partial contraction in skeletal muscles when the nerves to the muscle are severed.
J: Tonus refers to the state of full contraction in skeletal muscles.

Okay, so I've got this question about tonus or tone, and I need to figure out what it means. Let me start by recalling what I know about muscles and their states.

I remember that muscles have different states of contraction. There's the term "tonus" which I think is related to a constant state, not the maximum contraction. So, when a muscle is at rest, it's not completely relaxed. Instead, it maintains a certain level of tension. I think this is called muscle tone or tonus.

Looking at the options, let's go one by one.

Option A: Tonus refers to electrical activity in the brain during relaxation. Hmm, no, that doesn't seem right. Tonus is about muscles, not brain activity. So I can eliminate A.

Option B: Maximum force a muscle can exert. That sounds more like the definition of muscle strength or perhaps maximum contraction, not tonus. So B is probably not correct.

Option C: Flexibility and range of motion... I think flexibility is more about how much a joint can move, not directly about muscle contraction states. So C doesn't seem right.

Option D: State of complete relaxation. Wait, no. If muscles are completely relaxed, that's the opposite of tonus. Because tonus is a partial contraction. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Involuntary contraction of smooth muscles in the digestive tract. Oh, like the muscles in the intestines. I think that's more about peristalsis or smooth muscle activity, not tonus. So E is not the right choice.

Option F: Sustained partial contraction in skeletal muscles as long as nerves are intact. That sounds familiar. I remember that skeletal muscles have a resting tone, which is a low-level contraction. And that's maintained when the nerves are functioning. So F might be the correct answer.

Option G: Rhythmic contraction and relaxation of the heart. That's just the heartbeat, not related to tonus. So G is out.

Option H: Capacity to respond without conscious effort. That sounds more like reflexes or smooth muscle, not tonus. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Partial contraction when nerves are severed. Wait, if nerves are cut, can muscles still have tone? I think without nerve supply, muscles lose their tone and become flaccid. So I is the opposite of F. So I is wrong.

Option J: State of full contraction. That's like a cramp or tetanus, not tonus. So J is incorrect.

Putting it all together, the correct answer should be F.

The term "tonus" refers to the state of sustained partial contraction present in skeletal muscles as long as the nerves to the muscle are intact. This is the correct definition among the options provided.

Answer: F
