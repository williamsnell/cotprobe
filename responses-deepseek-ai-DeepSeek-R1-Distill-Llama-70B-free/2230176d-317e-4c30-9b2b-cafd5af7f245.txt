Okay, so I've got this question about the nephron and specifically the descending loop of Henle. Hmm, I remember that the nephron is the functional unit of the kidney, responsible for filtering waste and excess substances from the blood. The loop of Henle is part of this process, right?

Wait, the question is about the permeability of the descending loop. I think the loop of Henle has two parts: the descending limb and the ascending limb. Each part has different permeabilities. I remember that the descending loop is mainly involved in water reabsorption. Oh right, because as the filtrate moves through the loop, water is reabsorbed, which concentrates the urine.

So the descending loop is permeable to water and maybe some ions. But wait, which ions? I think ions like sodium and chloride are reabsorbed more in the ascending loop. The descending loop's main job is letting water pass through. Oh, but what about urea? I'm a bit fuzzy on that. 

Wait, I think the descending loop is impermeable to urea. Because urea's reabsorption happens more in the collecting duct, and the loop of Henle, especially the descending part, doesn't let much urea through. So the loop allows water to leave, which makes the filtrate more concentrated as it goes deeper into the medulla.

So the options are A to J. Let me look. The question is, which of these substances is the descending loop permeable to. The options include H+, Ca2+, Protein, Mg2+, Glucose, H2O, Na+, K+, Cl-, Urea.

I know that glucose is usually reabsorbed in the proximal convoluted tubule, so the loop doesn't deal with that. Proteins are generally too big to pass through, except in cases of kidney damage, but the loop probably doesn't allow them. 

Sodium and chloride are handled in the ascending loop, especially the thick segment. So the descending loop isn't very permeable to Na+ or Cl-; their reabsorption is more active there. 

What about ions like H+ or K+? I'm not sure. I think some ion transport might happen in different parts. The descending loop's main permeability is water. Oh, but wait, there's also urea. Wait, I'm getting confused. Urea can be reabsorbed in the collecting ducts, but is the loop permeable to it? Or is that part impermeable?

Wait, I think the descending loop is impermeable to urea. So urea isn't reabsorbed here. 

So the main thing the descending loop allows is water. So the correct answer should be H2O, which is option F. Let me check the options again. Option F is H2O. So the answer should be F.

The descending loop of Henle in the nephron is primarily involved in water reabsorption, a process that concentrates the filtrate as it moves through the medulla. Among the substances listed, the descending loop is permeable to water (H₂O). It is impermeable to urea, glucose, proteins, and most ions such as Na⁺, Cl⁻, K⁺, H⁺, Ca²⁺, and Mg²⁺, as these are either reabsorbed in other parts of the nephron or not significantly permeable in this segment.

The correct answer is **F: H₂O**.

Answer: F
