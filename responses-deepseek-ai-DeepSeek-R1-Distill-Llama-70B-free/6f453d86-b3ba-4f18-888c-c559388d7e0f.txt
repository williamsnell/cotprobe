Okay, so I have this problem about calculating the mass of water vapor in a room. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that relative humidity and vapor pressure are involved here. 

The room's volume is 400 m³, and the temperature is 27°C. The relative humidity is 60%. I think relative humidity is the ratio of the actual water vapor pressure to the saturated vapor pressure at that temperature. So first, I probably need to find the saturated vapor pressure at 27°C.

Wait, what's the saturated vapor pressure at 27°C? I don't remember the exact value, but maybe I can use the ideal gas law somehow. Oh wait, there's a table for this. Let me try to recall. At 25°C, I think it's about 3.17 kPa, but 27 is a bit higher. Maybe around 3.5 kPa? Or wait, maybe I should use more precise data. Alternatively, I can calculate it using the Antoine equation, but that might get complicated. I think for this problem, they expect me to know or approximate the saturation pressure.

Alternatively, maybe I can look up or use standard psychrometric tables. Let me think, at 27°C, the saturation vapor pressure (P_sat) is approximately 3.65 kPa. Okay, so if the relative humidity (RH) is 60%, then the actual vapor pressure (P) is RH times P_sat. So P = 0.6 * 3.65 kPa. Let me calculate that. 0.6 * 3.65 is 2.19 kPa. So P = 2.19 kPa.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact P_sat at 27°C. Let me try to confirm. Oh wait, maybe I can use the formula for saturated vapor pressure. Another approach: the saturation pressure can be calculated using the equation P_sat = exp( (T/(T + 238.3)) * 34.3 - 42.3 ) where T is in Celsius? Or wait, perhaps it's the Antoine equation. The Antoine equation for water is usually something like log10(P) = A - B/(T + C), where A, B, C are constants. For water, in the range of 1 to 100°C, I think A is 8.14019, B is 1810.94, and C is 244.485. So P_sat in mmHg. Let me calculate that.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Since the temperature is 27°C, perhaps I should look for P_sat at 30°C? No, 27 is close to 25, which I think has a P_sat of about 3.17 kPa. Let me think again. Maybe I can use an approximate value.

Alternatively, maybe I should proceed with the calculation using the ideal gas law. The mass of water vapor can be found by determining the number of moles of water in the air and then converting that to mass.

So the steps I think are: 

1. Find the saturated vapor pressure at 27°C (P_sat).
2. Multiply by RH to get the actual vapor pressure (P).
3. Use the ideal gas law to find the number of moles of water vapor, n = PV/(RT).
4. Multiply by the molar mass of water (18 g/mol) to get the mass.

Wait, but what are the units here? The room volume is in m³, which is 400 m³. Pressure should be in Pascals, I think.

Let me get into the calculations step by step.

First, find P_sat at 27°C. From tables, at 25°C, P_sat is about 3.16987 kPa. At 30°C, it's 4.2425 kPa. So at 27°C, it's somewhere in between. Maybe I can interpolate. The difference between 25 and 30 is 5°C, and P_sat goes from ~3.17 to ~4.24. So per degree, that's (4.24 - 3.17)/5 = 0.274 per degree C. So for 2 degrees above 25, 27°C, P_sat would be 3.17 + 2 * 0.274 = 3.17 + 0.548 = 3.718 kPa. Hmm, but maybe that's a rough estimate. Alternatively, perhaps I can use more precise data. Alternatively, just use 3.65 kPa as an approximate value. Let me check with the Antoine equation.

Using the Antoine equation for water in the range 1-100°C, the equation is:

log10(P) = 8.14019 - (1810.94)/(T + 244.485)

Wait, wait, no, maybe that's for mmHg. Let me confirm the units. The Antoine equation gives P in mmHg, so I'll have to convert to kPa afterward.

So for T = 27°C,

log10(P_mmHg) = 8.14019 - (1810.94)/(27 + 244.485)

Calculate denominator: 27 + 244.485 = 271.485

So 1810.94 / 271.485 ≈ let's see, 1810.94 ÷ 271.485 ≈ 6.668.

So log10(P) ≈ 8.14019 - 6.668 ≈ 1.472.

So P_mmHg = 10^1.472 ≈ 10^1.472. Let me calculate that. 10^0.472 is about 2.97, so 10^1.472 is about 29.7 mmHg.

Convert that to kPa: 29.7 mmHg * (101.325 kPa / 760 mmHg) = 29.7 * (101.325/760) ≈ 29.7 * 0.1333 ≈ 3.96 kPa.

Wait, so P_sat at 27°C is approximately 3.96 kPa. Hmm, that's a bit higher than my earlier interpolation. Well, let's proceed with that.

So P_sat = 3.96 kPa at 27°C.

Then, the actual vapor pressure P is 60% of that, so 0.6 * 3.96 = 2.376 kPa.

Now, using the ideal gas law, PV = nRT.

We need to find n, the number of moles of water vapor. R is the gas constant, which is 8.314 J/(mol·K). But wait, let's check the units.

P is in kPa, V is in m³. So to use R as 8.314, which is in J/(mol·K), the pressure needs to be in Pa (since 1 J = 1 Pa·m³).

So converting P = 2.376 kPa to Pa: 2376 Pa.

Volume V is 400 m³.

Temperature T is 27°C, which is 300.15 K.

So n = (P V) / (R T) = (2376 Pa * 400 m³) / (8.314 J/mol·K * 300.15 K)

Calculate numerator: 2376 * 400 = 950,400 Pa·m³ (which is 950,400 J, since 1 Pa·m³ = 1 J).

Denominator: 8.314 * 300.15 ≈ 8.314 * 300 = 2494.2, approximately 2494.2 J/mol.

So n ≈ 950400 / 2494.2 ≈ let's see, 950400 ÷ 2500 is 380.16, but since denominator is 2494.2, it's slightly higher. Let me compute it more accurately.

2494.2 * 380 = ?

2494.2 * 380 = 2494.2 * (300 + 80) = 748260 + 199,536 = 947,796.

But 950400 is 2,604 higher than 947,796. So 380 + (2604 / 2494.2) ≈ 380 + 1.044 ≈ 381.044 moles.

So n ≈ 381.044 mol.

Now, the molar mass of water is 18.015 g/mol, so mass m = n * 18.015 g = 381.044 * 18.015 g.

Let me calculate that: 381 * 18 = 6,858 g. But let's be precise.

381.044 * 18.015 = ?

Let me compute 380 * 18.015 = 6,845.7 g.

Plus 1.044 * 18.015 ≈ 18.8 g. So total is approx 6,845.7 + 18.8 = 6,864.5 g, which is about 6.8645 kg.

Wait, that's roughly 6.86 kg.

Looking at the options, the closest is option A:6.2 kg or H:5.6 kg, D:7.0 kg.

Wait, but my calculation gives about 6.86 kg, but the options don't have that. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, let me double-check the steps.

First, Antoine equation: I used log10(P) = 8.14019 - (1810.94)/(T + 244.485). For T=27°C, that's 27 + 244.485 = 271.485. 1810.94 / 271.485 = approx 6.668. So log10(P) = 8.14019 - 6.668 = 1.472. So P = 10^1.472 mmHg. 10^1.472 is around 29.7 mmHg. Convert to kPa: 29.7 mmHg * (101.325 /760) = 29.7 * 0.1333 ≈ 3.96 kPa. So P_sat is correct.

Then, RH is 60%, so P = 0.6 * 3.96 = 2.376 kPa. That's correct.

Then, P is 2376 Pa, V =400 m³.

n = (2376 * 400) / (8.314 * 300.15). Let me compute 2376*400=950400. 8.314 * 300.15= 2494.149. So 950400 / 2494.149 ≈ 381.05 moles.

Molar mass of H2O is 18.015 g/mol. So 381.05 * 18.015 = let's compute that:

18 * 381.05 = 6,858.9

0.015 * 381.05 ≈ 5.7158

Total: 6,858.9 +5.7158≈6,864.615 grams → 6.8646 kg.

So approximately 6.86 kg.

Looking at the options, the closest is A:6.2 kg, D:7.0 kg. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the Antoine equation. Alternatively, maybe I should have used a different value for P_sat.

Wait, maybe the P_sat at 27°C is actually lower than 3.96 kPa. Let me check another source or think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the relative humidity is provided, and I can use the psychrometric chart or another approach.

Wait, another approach: the mass of water vapor can be calculated using the specific humidity, which is the mass of water per mass of dry air. But maybe that's more complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the density of water vapor in air and then find the mass.

Wait, the specific gas constant for water vapor is Rv = R / M, where R is 8.314 J/mol·K, and M is molar mass of water (0.018015 kg/mol). So Rv = 8.314 / 0.018015 ≈ 461.5 J/kg·K.

Wait, but perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

Wait, another formula: the mass of water vapor can be found by m = (P * V * M) / (R * T), where M is molar mass, R is gas constant.

Wait, that's essentially the same as the ideal gas approach I did earlier.

Hmm, so perhaps my calculation is correct and the options might not include the exact value. Or perhaps I made a mistake in the Antoine calculation.

Wait, if I use a different P_sat, say 3.65 kPa, then P = 0.6 *3.65 = 2.19 kPa.

Let me recalculate with P=2.19 kPa (2190 Pa).

n = (2190 * 400) / (8.314 * 300.15)

2190 *400= 876000.

8.314 * 300.15≈2494.149.

n = 876000 /2494.149 ≈ approximately 351.4 moles.

Mass m=351.4 *18.015= 351.4*18=6315.2 + 351.4*0.015≈5.271 → 6320.47 g → 6.32 kg.

Hmm, that's about 6.32 kg, which is closer to option A (6.2 kg), but still not exact.

Wait, maybe using a more precise P_sat value would help. Let me look for the exact saturation pressure at 27°C. Maybe I can find it from a table.

Upon checking, at 27°C, the saturation pressure is approximately 3.60 kPa. Let me use that value.

So P_sat = 3.60 kPa. Then, P = 0.6 *3.60 = 2.16 kPa.

Now, P=2160 Pa. V=400 m³.

n = (2160 *400)/(8.314*300.15) = 864000 / 2494.149 ≈ 346.43 moles.

Mass m=346.43 *18.015=?

346 *18=6216, 0.43*18≈7.74 → 6223.74 g. Plus 346.43 *0.015=5.196 → total m≈6223.74 +5.196=6228.936 g =6.2289 kg.

So approximately 6.23 kg. The closest option is A:6.2 kg.

Wait, but when I used P_sat=3.96 kPa, I got around 6.86 kg, which isn't in the options. But when using P_sat=3.60 kPa, I get about 6.23 kg, which is close to option A:6.2 kg.

But I'm a bit confused because when I calculated using the Antoine equation, I got P_sat=3.96 kPa. Maybe the exact value is lower, perhaps 3.60 kPa. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the Antoine equation.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the saturation pressure from another source. For example, at 25°C, it's 3.169 kPa, and at 30°C, it's 4.242 kPa. So linearly, 27°C is 2/5 of the way from 25 to 30. So the increase is (4.242 -3.169)=1.073 kPa over 5 degrees. So per degree, 0.2146 kPa. So for 2 degrees, 0.429 kPa. So P_sat=3.169 +0.429=3.598 kPa. So about 3.60 kPa, which aligns with the value I just used.

So using P_sat=3.60 kPa, the calculation gives m≈6.23 kg, which is option A:6.2 kg.

But wait, the options have option D:7.0 kg. Hmm. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate with P_sat=3.60 kPa.

So P=0.6 *3.60 = 2.16 kPa = 2160 Pa.

n= (2160 *400)/(8.314 *300.15) = (864000) / (2494.149) ≈ 346.43 mol.

Mass is 346.43 * 18.015 g/mol.

Compute 346 *18 = 6,228 g.

0.43 *18=7.74 g.

So 6,228 +7.74=6,235.74 g from the integer part.

Then, 346.43 * 0.015 g/mol = 5.19645 g.

So total mass is 6,235.74 +5.19645 ≈6,240.936 grams, which is 6.24 kg.

Hmm, so approximately 6.24 kg. The options are A:6.2 kg, which is very close. Alternatively, perhaps the options rounded to one decimal place, so 6.2 kg is correct.

But wait, another approach: perhaps using the specific humidity equation. Specific humidity (w) is 0.622 * (P_v / P_atm), where P_v is the vapor pressure and P_atm is atmospheric pressure (101.325 kPa).

Wait, no, specific humidity is defined as the mass of water vapor per mass of dry air, and is given by w = (0.622 P_v)/P. But perhaps that's more complicated.

Alternatively, the formula for mass of water vapor can be written as m = (P_v * V * M) / (R * T), where M is molar mass.

Wait, another approach: the mass can be found by m = (P * V) / (R_specific * T), where R_specific is the specific gas constant for water vapor.

R_specific for water vapor is R / M = 8.314 / 0.018015 ≈ 461.5 J/kg·K.

So m = (P * V) / (R_specific * T).

So P = 2160 Pa, V=400 m³, T=300.15 K, R_specific=461.5 J/kg·K.

Compute m: (2160 *400) / (461.5 * 300.15) → 864000 / (138,447.95) ≈ 6.24 kg.

Same result as before. So about 6.24 kg, which is closest to option A:6.2 kg.

But wait, the options have option D:7.0 kg. Could I have missed a factor somewhere? Let me check the units again.

Wait, R is 8.314 J/mol·K, M is 0.018015 kg/mol.

So in the formula m = (P*V*M)/(R*T), P must be in Pa, V in m³, R in J/mol·K, T in K.

Yes, that's correct. So m = (2160 *400 * 0.018
