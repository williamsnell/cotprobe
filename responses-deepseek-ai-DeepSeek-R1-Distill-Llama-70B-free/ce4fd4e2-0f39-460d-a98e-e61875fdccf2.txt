Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about an object viewed through a plate of glass with plane parallel faces. The glass has a refractive index of 1.5. The object appears to be five-sixths of an inch nearer than it really is. I need to find out how thick the glass is.

Hmm, I remember that when light passes through a medium like glass, it bends, which can cause objects to appear shifted. I think this is related to the concept of apparent depth. Oh right, when you look at an object through a medium, the object's position seems different because of the refraction.

Wait, the formula for apparent depth is something like the real depth divided by the refractive index, but I'm not sure. Or is it the other way around? No, wait, when you have a medium, the apparent depth is less than the real depth. Because light bends away from the normal when entering a denser medium. So the formula should be apparent depth equals real depth divided by n. Or is it multiplied?

Wait, let me think. Suppose you have an object at a certain depth in water (n=1.33). When you look straight down, it appears shallower. The formula I remember is that the apparent depth (d') is equal to the real depth (d) divided by n. So d' = d / n. But wait, that would make the apparent depth smaller than the real one. But in this case, the object appears nearer, which means the apparent depth is less than the real depth. So that fits.

Wait, no, wait. The question says the object appears five-sixths of an inch nearer. So the difference between the real position and the apparent position is 5/6 inch. So if the real depth is d, the apparent depth is d minus 5/6. Or wait, maybe the apparent depth is d' = d - 5/6. Or perhaps it's the other way around.

Wait, let me get this straight. Suppose the object is at a real depth d behind the glass. When viewed through the glass, it appears at a depth d'. The difference is d - d' = 5/6 inch. Because the object appears nearer, so d' is less than d by 5/6. So d - d' = 5/6.

Wait, but the formula for the apparent depth when looking through a medium is d' = (d) / n. Is that correct? So d' = d / n, so the real depth is d = n * d'. But wait, that might not be the case here because the glass has two surfaces. Oh wait, the glass is a plate with two plane parallel faces. So the situation is that the object is viewed through a glass plate of thickness t. So the light passes into the glass and then exits.

Wait, wait. There's a formula for the apparent position when looking through a glass slab. I think it's that the shift in position is given by t * (1 - 1/n), where t is the thickness. Because when the light enters the glass, it's refracted, causing an apparent shift. So the formula for the shift is delta = t (1 - 1/n). That makes sense because if n is large, the shift would be smaller.

So the problem states that the shift (delta) is 5/6 inch. So we can set up the equation: delta = t (1 - 1/n). Plugging in the numbers, we have:

5/6 = t (1 - 1/1.5)

Let me compute 1 - 1/1.5. 1.5 is 3/2, so 1/(3/2) is 2/3. So 1 - 2/3 is 1/3. So the equation becomes:

5/6 = t * (1/3)

To solve for t, multiply both sides by 3:

t = (5/6) * 3 = 5/2 = 2.5 inches.

Wait, that would make the thickness 2.5 inches. Let me check the options. Option F is 2.5 inches.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the formula. I'm a bit confused about the derivation. So when you have a glass plate of thickness t, the light enters the glass and is displaced. The displacement is t times (1 - cos(theta)), but when looking perpendicular (normal incidence), theta is zero, so cos(theta) is 1. That would give zero displacement, which can't be right. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait another approach. The apparent depth when looking through a medium is given by d' = d_real / n. But that's when the object is in the medium. But in this case, the object is behind the glass. So the light goes through the glass, which causes a shift.

Wait, maybe I should think about the lateral shift when a beam of light passes through a parallel plate. The formula for the lateral shift (s) is given by s = t sin(theta)(1 - cos(theta))/n, but at normal incidence, theta is zero, so sin(theta) is zero. So that would make s zero. That can't be right because the problem says there's a shift.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing the concepts here. Let me think differently. When an object is viewed through a glass plate, the image is formed due to the refraction at both surfaces. The first surface (air-glass) and the second surface (glass-air). The overall effect is that the image appears shifted.

I remember that the formula for the shift (delta) is delta = t (n - 1)/n, but I'm not sure. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Alternatively, I've heard that the apparent shift is t*(1 - 1/n). Let me think about the derivation.

Suppose the glass has thickness t. The object is at a distance d behind the glass (so beyond the second surface). The light coming from the object enters the glass, slowing down, and then exits. The path of the light causes the image to shift.

Wait, another approach: the real depth is t, but the apparent depth is t/n. So the difference would be t - t/n = t (1 - 1/n). But wait, no—because the object is not inside the glass but behind it. So the object is at some real distance beyond the glass. Hmm, maybe that's complicating it.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is delta = t (1 - 1/n). So in this problem, delta is 5/6 inch. So we can solve for t.

So plugging in:

5/6 = t (1 - 1.5) → wait, 1 - 1/1.5 is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3. So:

5/6 = t * (1/3)

Multiply both sides by 3:

t = (5/6) * 3 = 15/6 = 2.5 inches.

So the thickness would be 2.5 inches, which is option F.
</think>

To determine the thickness of the glass plate, we use the formula for the apparent shift in position when viewing an object through a medium. The shift, denoted as \( \Delta \), is given by:

\[
\Delta = t \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right)
\]

where:
- \( t \) is the thickness of the glass,
- \( n \) is the refractive index of the glass,
- \( \Delta \) is the apparent shift in position.

The problem states that the shift (\( \Delta \)) is \( \frac{5}{6} \) inch, and the refractive index (\( n \)) of the glass is 1.5. Substituting these values into the equation:

\[
\frac{5}{6} = t \left( 1 - \frac{1}{1.5} \right)
\]

First, calculate \( 1 - \frac{1}{1.5} \):
\[
1 - \frac{1}{1.5} = 1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Now substitute this back into the equation:
\[
\frac{5}{6} = t \cdot \frac{1}{3}
\]

Solve for \( t \) by multiplying both sides by 3:
\[
t = \frac{5}{6} \cdot 3 = \frac{15}{6} = 2.5 \, \text{inches}
\]

Thus, the thickness of the glass is 2.5 inches. Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**F: 2.5 inches**
