Question:

A teachers union, a nongovernmental entity, seeks to picket the local city school board for its decision to require higher certification for instructors who wish to teach in the gifted and talented classes in elementary school. After a few days of picketing, the school board seeks a temporary injunction in the state court to restrain further picketing of the school board. The school board insists that the teachers union has violated Section 101 of the city's picketing ordinance. Section 101 reads as follows:"Section 101. No picketing shall be permitted inside of, or on any sidewalk or street immediately adjacent or contiguous to public elementary and secondary schools without express permission of the mayor. Applications for such permission shall be filed at least three days before such picketing is intended to begin and shall state the purpose, place, and time of the proposed picketing. "The court will most likely

Options:

A: deny relief, because the ordinance does not clearly define what constitutes as "immediately adjacent or contiguous."
B: deny relief, because the teachers union has the right to peaceful protest.
C: deny relief, because the picketing ordinancewas unconstitutional on its face.
D: grant relief, because the ordinance isconstitutional.
E: grant relief, because the ordinance is necessary for the maintenance of peace and order around schools.
F: grant relief, because the picketing disrupted the operation of the school.
G: deny relief, because the ordinance does notprovide procedural due process.
H: deny relief, because the ordinance infringes on the union's right to freedom of speech.
I: grant relief, because the teachers union did not receive permission from the mayor.

Okay, so I've got this legal question here about a teachers union picketing a school board and the school board trying to get a temporary injunction based on a city ordinance. Hmm, I need to figure out what the court would do. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the situation: The teachers union is picketing because the school board required higher certification for teachers in gifted classes. They've been picketing for a few days, and now the school board wants a court to stop them using Section 101 of the picketing ordinance.

Looking at Section 101, it says no picketing is allowed near public schools without the mayor's permission. They have to apply three days in advance, stating purpose, place, and time. So the union didn't get permission, I assume, since the question says they just started picketing.

The issue here is probably about the constitutionality of the ordinance. I remember that laws restricting picketing or protests usually have to balance free speech rights against public safety or other government interests.

So, the key points are: is the ordinance constitutional? If it is, the court might grant relief. If not, they'll deny it.

What makes an ordinance unconstitutional in this context? Well, if it's a prior restraint on free speech, that's a big issue. Prior restraints are generally not allowed unless they meet strict scrutiny. The Supreme Court has dealt with cases where the government requires permits for public speech, like in Murdock v. Pennsylvania or Watchtower v. Stratton, where permit requirements were struck down as unconstitutional because they allowed the government too much discretion.

Section 101 requires permission from the mayor, which is a prior restraint. The mayor's permission could be subjective, and the ordinance doesn't provide clear standards on how permission is granted or denied. That might make it unconstitutional because it gives too much discretion to the mayor, potentially leading to content-based restrictions.

Also, the ordinance requires applications three days in advance. That could be seen as an unreasonable restriction on spontaneous speech, which is protected. In some cases, like in Cox v. New Hampshire, a permit system was upheld if it was content-neutral and necessary for public order, but if the system allows for too much administrative discretion, it might not pass muster.

So, the teachers union's picketing is a form of peaceful protest, which is protected under the First Amendment. The school board is trying to stop it based on an ordinance that might infringe on free speech rights because it requires prior permission without clear guidelines.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the ordinance isn't clear about "immediately adjacent," but I don't think that's the main issue here. The bigger problem is prior restraint and free speech.

Option B says the union has the right to peaceful protest, which is true, but it's more about whether the ordinance is an unconstitutional restriction.

Option C says the ordinance is unconstitutional on its face. That seems possible because it's a prior restraint with too much discretion.

Option D says the ordinance is constitutional, but I think that's less likely because of the prior restraint issue.

Option E says it's necessary for peace, but again, prior restraint might not be justified just for that.

Option F says picketing disrupted school operations, but the question doesn't specify that; it's more about the location and permit.

Option G talks about procedural due process, which might be a stretch here. The issue is more about free speech than due process.

Option H says the ordinance infringes on free speech. This is possible, but it's more about whether the ordinance is facially invalid or not.

Option I says the union didn't get permission, so the injunction should be granted. But if the ordinance is unconstitutional, then not getting permission wouldn't matter.

So, the court would likely deny relief because the ordinance is unconstitutional as a prior restraint on free speech. So options C or H are in play. But wait, the question is about whether the court will grant or deny the injunction.

If the ordinance is unconstitutional, the court would deny relief. So the options are B, C, G, H.

But the main issue is the prior restraint. In Murdock v. Pennsylvania, the court struck down a permit fee because it was a tax on free speech. Similarly, in Watchtower, the court said that requiring a permit for door-to-door advocacy was unconstitutional because it allowed too much discretion and was a prior restraint.

So Section 101 is a prior restraint because it requires permission, which could be denied arbitrarily. Thus, the ordinance is unconstitutional on its face, making option C correct.

Wait, but some might argue that the requirement is content-neutral and necessary for public safety. But the problem is the lack of clear standards, making it a facial challenge. So the court would likely find the ordinance unconstitutional, thus denying relief to the school board.

The question revolves around the constitutionality of Section 101 of the city's picketing ordinance, which requires prior permission from the mayor to picket near schools. The teachers union did not obtain such permission, and the school board seeks an injunction to stop the picketing. The key issue is whether the ordinance violates the First Amendment by imposing an unconstitutional prior restraint on free speech.

Section 101 mandates that picketing near schools requires advance permission from the mayor, with applications submitted three days in advance. This constitutes a prior restraint on speech, which is generally disfavored under the First Amendment unless it meets strict scrutiny. The ordinance's requirement of mayoral permission introduces subjective discretion, potentially allowing content-based restrictions. Additionally, the three-day notice requirement could impede spontaneous speech, further raising constitutional concerns.

Relevant case law, such as *Watchtower v. Stratton*, establishes that permit requirements for speech activities are unconstitutional if they grant excessive discretion to government officials or impose unreasonable restrictions. While some permit systems are upheld if they are content-neutral and necessary for public order (e.g., *Cox v. New Hampshire*), Section 101 likely fails these standards due to its lack of clear guidelines and potential for arbitrary enforcement.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The ambiguity of "immediately adjacent or contiguous" is not the central issue; the focus is on the ordinance's constitutionality as a prior restraint.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. While peaceful protest is protected, the issue is whether the ordinance's restrictions are lawful.
- **Option C**: Correct. The ordinance is unconstitutional on its face due to its status as a prior restraint with insufficient safeguards against arbitrary enforcement.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The ordinance is unlikely to be deemed constitutional because it imposes an unconstitutional prior restraint.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The need for peace does not justify an unconstitutional prior restraint.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. There is no evidence the picketing disrupted school operations.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The issue is free speech, not procedural due process.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. While the ordinance infringes on free speech, the specific reason is its facial unconstitutionality as a prior restraint.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The union's lack of permission is irrelevant if the ordinance is unconstitutional.

The court is most likely to deny relief because Section 101 is unconstitutional on its face as an impermissible prior restraint on free speech.
