Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about the term 'medicalization.' I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. 

The question asks which statement best describes the process of medicalization. I remember that medicalization has something to do with how certain issues are framed as medical problems, but I need to recall the exact definition.

Let me go through each option one by one. 

Option A says medicalization is when a health issue is considered an economic problem. Wait, no, that sounds more like economization. Medicalization should be the opposite, making things medical rather than economic. So A doesn't seem right.

Option B states that medicalization occurs when social issues are increasingly seen and responded to as medical problems. That rings a bell. I think medicalization refers to taking issues that were once considered social or cultural and turning them into medical matters. So B fits my initial understanding.

Option C says an issue is medicalized when dismissed as a security threat and deemed a medical issue. That doesn't sound right. Medicalization isn't about replacing security concerns but about framing non-medical issues as medical. So C is probably incorrect.

Option D suggests that medicalization is when an issue is no longer a health concern but a cultural matter. Wait, that seems opposite. Medicalization would make something a health issue, not take it away. So D is likely wrong.

Option E talks about security dialogue using medical language. That might relate to securitization, where issues are framed as security threats. But the question is about medicalization, so E doesn't fit.

Option F refers to a medical issue becoming a legal one. That would be legalization, not medicalization. So F is out.

Option G describes turning a social issue into a security issue. Again, that's more about securitization, not medicalization. So G isn't the answer.

Option H says medicalization is when a health issue becomes securitized. No, securitization is a different concept where something is framed as a security threat. Medicalization is about medical framing, so H is incorrect.

Option I mentions shifting from security to education. That doesn't relate to medicalization. It's about changing domains, but not to medical. So I is wrong.

Option J is about interpreting political issues in medical terms. That could be part of medicalization, but I think the broader concept is about social issues being medicalized. So B seems more comprehensive than J.

Putting it all together, B looks like the correct answer because it directly ties social issues being treated as medical problems, which aligns with what I remember about medicalization.

The correct answer is:

B: The perceived 'medicalization' of societies occurs when social issues are increasingly considered and responded to as medical problems.
