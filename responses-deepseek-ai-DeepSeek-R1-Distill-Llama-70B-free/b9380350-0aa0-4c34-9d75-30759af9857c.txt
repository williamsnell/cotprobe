Okay, so I'm trying to solve this chemistry problem, and honestly, I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

So, the scenario is: a chemist dissolves methyl alcohol in n-octane and adds this to excess methylmagnesium iodide in n-butyl ether. A gas is evolved, and it's collected at STP, occupying 1.04 cc. The question is asking what the gas is and how many grams of methyl alcohol were present. The options are A to J, each pairing a gas with a mass of methyl alcohol.

Hmm, I remember that methylmagnesium iodide is a Grignard reagent. Grignard reagents usually react with alcohols, but wait, in what way? Oh right, Grignard reagents react with alcohols to produce alkanes. Wait, no, actually, wait. No, Grignard reagents are strong bases, so when they react with alcohols, which are acidic compared to alkanes, they deprotonate them. But that's when the alcohol is in an aqueous solution, right?

Wait, no, in this case, the Grignard is in an ether solvent. Oh, but the setup is that the methyl alcohol is added to excess Grignard. So I think the Grignard would react with the alcohol. But wait, no, that's not right. Wait, Grignard reagents react with carbonyl groups, like ketones, aldehydes, esters, etc. But methyl alcohol is an alcohol, not a carbonyl compound. So maybe I'm mixing things up.

Wait, perhaps the Grignard is in excess, so it's a two-step reaction. Oh wait, methyl alcohol (methanol) would react with the Grignard reagent. Let me think about the reaction. Grignard reagents react with alcohols in a way? Hmm.

Wait, another thought: Grignard reagents are strong nucleophiles and bases. When they react with alcohols, which are proton donors, the Grignard (like CH3MgI) would deprotonate the alcohol. So methanol (CH3OH) has an -OH group. The Grignard would abstract a proton, producing CH3O- and CH4 (methane), maybe.

Wait, wait. Let me think about the reaction. Methanol (CH3OH) has a proton. The Grignard reagent (CH3MgI) is a strong base. So it would take that proton. The reaction should be:

CH3OH + CH3MgI → CH3O^- MgI^+ + CH4↑ 

So the products would be methane gas and the magnesium salt of the methoxide ion. Because when the Grignard abstracts the proton, the oxygen becomes negatively charged, and the MgI would pair with it. And the other part would be the methane.

So the gas evolved is methane. That would mean that the gas is CH4, so looking at the options, the first part of the answer should be methane. Let's look at the options.

Looking at options, B, D, I, and J have methane as the gas. Now, the second part is the mass of methyl alcohol.

So the volume of the gas is 1.04 cc at STP. I remember that at STP, one mole of gas occupies 22.4 liters. But wait, wait, STP conditions vary. The standard pressure is 1 atm, and temperature is 273 K (0°C). So 22.4 L per mole.

But wait, 1.04 cc is 1.04 mL, which is 0.00104 liters. So how many moles of CH4 is that?

Moles = volume (L) / 22.4 L/mol.

So 0.00104 / 22.4 = let's calculate that.

0.00104 / 22.4 = 4.64e-5 moles of CH4.

But each mole of CH4 corresponds to one mole of CH3OH, because the reaction is 1:1. Because each molecule of methanol gives one molecule of methane.

So moles of CH3OH = 4.64e-5 mol.

Now, the molar mass of methanol is 32.04 g/mol (CH3OH: C=12, H3=3, O=16, H=1 → 12+3+16+1=32 g/mol).

So mass = moles × molar mass = 4.64e-5 mol × 32.04 g/mol.

Let me compute that.

4.64e-5 × 32.04 = ?

Well, 4.64e-5 is 0.0000464. 0.0000464 × 32.04.

32 × 0.0000464 = 0.0014848.

0.04 × 0.0000464 = 0.000001856.

Wait, actually, 32.04 is 32 + 0.04. So 0.0000464 × 32 = 0.0014848, and 0.0000464 × 0.04 = 0.000001856.

Adding those: 0.0014848 + 0.000001856 = 0.001486656 grams.

Which is approximately 1.486656e-3 grams, or 1.49e-3 grams, but let's see the options.

Looking again, the options are:

A: H2, 1.48e-3 g

B: CH4, 0.74e-3

C: H2, 2.96e-3

D: CH4, 3.00e-3

I: CH4, 1.48e-3

So the calculation gives about 1.486e-3 grams, which is approximately 1.49e-3, but the closest option is I: CH4, 1.48e-3 grams.

Wait, but wait another thing. Let me double-check the molar mass.

Methanol is CH3OH, which is 12 (C) + 4*(1) [since CH3OH has four H: three in CH3 and one in OH? Or wait, CH3OH: C=12, H=4, O=16. So molar mass is 12 + 4 + 16 = 32 g/mol.

Yes, that's correct. So yes, 4.64e-5 mol × 32 g/mol = 1.4848e-3 grams.

Looking at the options, option I is Methane and 1.48e-3 grams. Option B is 0.74e-3, which is about half. So why?

Wait, did I make a mistake in the stoichiometry? Let me think again. The reaction is CH3OH + CH3MgI → CH3O^- MgI^+ + CH4↑.

So each mole of CH3OH gives one mole of CH4. So yes, the moles are the same. So the calculation seems correct.

Another possibility: Did I compute the volume correctly? The volume is 1.04 cc, which I took as 1.04 mL = 0.00104 L.

Yes, because 1 L = 1000 mL, so 1.04 mL is 0.00104 L.

So the moles of CH4 would be 0.00104 L / 22.4 L/mol = approx 4.64e-5 mol.

So everything seems correct. Then the mass is 1.48e-3 grams, so option I.

But wait, looking at the options:

Option I: Methane, 1.48e-3 grams.

Yes, that's the answer. So the correct option is I.

The question involves the reaction of methyl alcohol (methanol, CH₃OH) with excess methylmagnesium iodide (a Grignard reagent) in n-butyl ether. Grignard reagents are strong bases and react with alcohols by deprotonating them. The reaction is as follows:

\[
\text{CH₃OH} + \text{CH₃MgI} \rightarrow \text{CH₃O}^- \text{MgI}^+ + \text{CH₄} \uparrow
\]

This reaction produces methane gas (CH₄) and the magnesium salt of methoxide (CH₃O⁻MgI⁺). The gas evolved is therefore methane.

The volume of methane collected at STP is 1.04 cc (or 1.04 mL), which is equivalent to 0.00104 L. At STP, 1 mole of gas occupies 22.4 L, so the number of moles of methane is:

\[
\text{Moles of CH₄} = \frac{\text{Volume (L)}}{22.4 \, \text{L/mol}} = \frac{0.00104}{22.4} = 4.64 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{mol}
\]

Since the reaction is 1:1 between methanol and methane, the number of moles of methanol is also \( 4.64 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{mol} \). The molar mass of methanol (CH₃OH) is:

\[
\text{Molar mass of CH₃OH} = 12 + 4(1) + 16 = 32 \, \text{g/mol}
\]

The mass of methanol is then:

\[
\text{Mass of CH₃OH} = \text{Moles} \times \text{Molar mass} = (4.64 \times 10^{-5}) \times 32 = 1.4848 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{g}
\]

This value is approximately \( 1.48 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{g} \), which matches the mass of methanol in option I. Additionally, the gas is confirmed to be methane, as stated in option I.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**I: Methane, 1.48 × 10⁻³ grams of methyl alcohol**

Answer: I
