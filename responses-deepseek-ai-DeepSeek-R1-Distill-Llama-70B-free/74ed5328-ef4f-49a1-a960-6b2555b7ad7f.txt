The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

"Hard" water contains small amounts of the salts calcium bicarbonate (Ca(HCO_3)_2) and calcium sulfate (CaSO_4, molecular weight = 136 g/mole). These react with soap before it has a chance to lather, which is responsible for its cleansing ability. Ca(HCO_3)_2 is removed by boiling to form insoluble CaCO_3. CaSO_4, is removed by reaction with washing soda (Na_2 CO_3, molecular weight = 106 g/mole) according to the following equation: CaSO_4 + Na_2 CO_3 \rightarrow CaCO_3 + Na_2 SO_4. If the rivers surrounding New York City have a CaSO_4 concentration of 1.8 × 10^-3 g/liter, how much Na_2 CO_3 is required to "soften" (remove CaSO_4) the water consumed by the city in one day (about 6.8 × 10^9 liters)?

Options:

A: 8 tons
B: 35 tons
C: 25 tons
D: 12 tons
E: 50 tons
F: 30 tons
G: 15 tons
H: 20 tons
I: 5 tons
J: 10 tons

Okay, I'm trying to figure out how much washing soda (Na2CO3) is needed to soften the water for New York City in one day. The problem gives me the concentration of calcium sulfate (CaSO4) in the river water, which is 1.8 × 10^-3 grams per liter. The city uses about 6.8 × 10^9 liters daily. 

First, I think I need to calculate the total amount of CaSO4 in all the water used in a day. So, I'll multiply the concentration by the volume. Let me write that down:

Total CaSO4 = 1.8e-3 g/L * 6.8e9 L.

Hmm, let me compute that. 1.8e-3 is 0.0018. Multiplying by 6.8e9 (which is 6,800,000,000) gives:

0.0018 * 6.8e9 = 1.8 * 6.8 * 1e6. 

Wait, 1.8 * 6.8 is around 12.24. So 12.24e6 grams, which is 12,240,000 grams. To convert that to kilograms, divide by 1000: 12,240 kg. But wait, that's 12,240 kg, which is 12.24 metric tons. But wait, wait, no, wait: the problem mentions that the molecular weights are given, so perhaps I need to do a molar calculation.

Oh right, because the reaction between CaSO4 and Na2CO3 is 1:1, right? So the moles of CaSO4 will determine the moles of Na2CO3 needed.

So, first, find moles of CaSO4. The molecular weight of CaSO4 is given as 136 g/mol.

So moles CaSO4 = total mass CaSO4 / molar mass.

Total mass is 12,240,000 grams, so 12,240,000 g / 136 g/mol.

Let me compute that. 12,240,000 divided by 136.

Hmm, 12,240,000 / 136. Let me see: 136 * 90,000 is 12,240,000 (since 136 * 90,000 = 136 * 9e4 = 1.224e7, which is 12,240,000). Oh wait, wait, no. Let me double-check. 136 * 90,000 = 136 * 9e4. 136 * 9 is 1224, so 1224e4 is 12,240,000. So that means the moles of CaSO4 is 90,000 moles.

Since the reaction is 1:1, moles of Na2CO3 needed is also 90,000 moles.

Now, the molar mass of Na2CO3 is 106 g/mol. So total mass needed is moles * molar mass.

90,000 mol * 106 g/mol = 9,540,000 grams. Convert grams to metric tons (since 1 metric ton is 1e6 grams):

9,540,000 g = 9,540 kg = 9.54 metric tons.

Wait, but that's about 9.5 tons. But looking at the options, the closest is option J (10 tons) or maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, let's recalculate the initial numbers more precisely.

First step: total mass of CaSO4.

Concentration = 1.8e-3 g/L = 0.0018 g/L.

Volume = 6.8e9 L.

Mass = 0.0018 * 6.8e9 = (0.0018) * (6.8e9) = 1.8e-3 * 6.8e9 = (1.8 * 6.8) * 1e6.

1.8 * 6.8: 1*6.8=6.8, 0.8*6.8=5.44. So 6.8 +5.44=12.24. So 12.24e6 grams = 12,240,000 grams. Correct.

Molar mass CaSO4 is 136 g/mol. So moles = 12,240,000 / 136.

12,240,000 / 136 = Let's compute this.

Divide both numerator and denominator by 8: 12,240,000 /8 = 1,530,000; 136/8=17.

So 1,530,000 / 17 = approx 90,000 (since 17 * 90,000 = 1,530,000). So yes, 90,000 moles.

Molar mass Na2CO3 is 106 g/mol: 90,000 * 106 = 9,540,000 grams = 9,540 kg = 9.54 tons.

But the options don't have 9.54. The options are in whole numbers. Let's see the options again.

Options are A:8, B:35, C:25, D:12, E:50, F:30, G:15, H:20, I:5, J:10.

Hmm, 9.54 is closest to 10, which is option J. So why isn't that the answer? But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, perhaps the units were mixed up. Let me check the initial steps again.

Wait, perhaps the volume is 6.8e9 liters, that's 6.8 billion liters.

But wait, the concentration is 1.8e-3 g per liter. So multiplying gives grams. Correct.

Wait, perhaps I missed something else. Maybe the stoichiometry isn't 1:1?

Looking back at the equation: CaSO4 + Na2CO3 → CaCO3 + Na2SO4.

Yes, it's 1:1 ratio. So moles of Na2CO3 needed equals moles of CaSO4.

Hmm. So according to my calculation, the needed Na2CO3 is 9.54 tons, which is approximately 10 tons, which would be option J.

But wait, the options don't have 10 as the first option. Looking back: option J is 10 tons.

Wait, but another thought: the question asks for the answer in tons, but what kind of tons? In the US, a ton is 2000 pounds, which is about 907,000 grams (0.907 megagrams). So a metric ton is 1e6 grams, and a US ton is approximately 0.907 metric tons.

Wait, but the options are given in "tons", but I'm not certain whether it's metric tons or US tons. If the question uses "tons" as metric tons, then 9.54 would be about 9.5 metric tons, so the closest option is J (10 tons). But if it's US tons, then 9.54 metric tons is about 10.5 US tons, which would round to 10 or 11. But the options don't have 11. So perhaps the answer is 10 tons, which is option J.

Wait, but I'm seeing that another approach might have a mistake. Let me try another way.

Another approach: compute moles.

Moles CaSO4 = (1.8e-3 g/L) * (6.8e9 L) / 136 g/mol.

So 1.8e-3 *6.8e9 = 1.8 *6.8 * 1e6 (since 1e-3 *1e9=1e6). 1.8*6.8=12.24.

So 12.24e6 /136 = 12,240,000 /136 = 90,000 moles.

So moles of Na2CO3 needed is 90,000.

Mass of Na2CO3 = 90,000 mol *106 g/mol = 9,540,000 grams.

Convert grams to metric tons: 9,540,000 grams = 9.54 metric tons.

So the closest option is J:10 tons.

But wait, the options include 10 tons as option J, but another thought: perhaps the initial concentration was 1.8e-3 g/L, but perhaps I should have considered the molarity. Wait, no, the way I did it was correct because I computed the total grams first.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of 1.8e-3 *6.8e9.

Wait, 1.8e-3 is 0.0018.

0.0018 *6.8e9 = 0.0018 *6,800,000,000.

Let me compute that: 0.0018 *6.8e9.

= (0.0018) * (6.8e9)

= 1.8e-3 *6.8e9 = (1.8 *6.8) * 1e6.

1.8 *6.8 = let's compute:

6 *1.8 =10.8; 0.8*1.8=1.44 → total 12.24. So 12.24e6 grams.

Yes, that's correct.

So the calculation seems accurate, leading to approximately 9.54 metric tons. The closest option is J:10 tons.

But wait, I'm now looking at the options again, and option H is 20 tons, which is double what I got. Did I miss a factor of 2 somewhere?

Wait, let me review the reaction equation again: CaSO4 + Na2CO3 → CaCO3 + Na2SO4. The stoichiometry is 1:1, so I don't think I missed a factor of 2.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the amount of Na2CO3 in tons? Because 9.54 is about 9.5, but perhaps the options are in short tons (US tons). Let me check.

Wait, 1 metric ton = 1000 kg = 1e6 grams.

1 US ton = 2000 pounds. 1 pound is about 453.592 grams. So 2000 *453.592 = 907,184 grams. So 1 US ton ≈ 907,184 grams.

So 9,540,000 grams is how many US tons?

9,540,000 g / 907,184 g/ton ≈ 10.51 US tons.

So approximately 10.5 US tons. The options don't have 10.5, but option J is 10 tons. So perhaps the answer is J. But wait, another thought: perhaps the problem uses the term "tons" as metric tons, which is 9.54, so again, 10 is the closest.

Alternatively, perhaps I messed up the initial units. Another way to think: perhaps the concentration is 1.8e-3 molar? No, the problem says 1.8e-3 g/liter.

Wait, perhaps the initial step should have been to find the moles per liter first, then multiply by the volume.

So moles per liter of CaSO4 = (1.8e-3 g/L) / (136 g/mol) = (0.0018 /136) mol/L.

Compute that: 0.0018 /136 ≈ 1.3235e-5 mol/L.

Then total moles = 1.3235e-5 mol/L *6.8e9 L = (1.3235e-5) *6.8e9.

Multiply 1.3235e-5 by 6.8e9: 1.3235 *6.8 = approx 9. So 9e4 (since 1e-5 *1e9=1e4). So 9e4 mol → 90,000 mol. Same as before.

So same result. So 90,000 mol Na2CO3 needed. Multiply by molar mass 106 → 9,540,000 grams = 9.54 metric tons.

So again, the answer should be about 10 metric tons, which is option J.

Wait, but the available options are:

A:8 tons

B:35 tons

C:25 tons

D:12 tons

E:50 tons

F:30 tons

G:15 tons

H:20 tons

I:5 tons

J:10 tons

So the correct answer would be J:10 tons.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because another way to approach it is to compute moles, then grams, then tons.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the mass of Na2CO3.

Wait, let me compute 90,000 mol * 106 g/mol.

90,000 *100 =9,000,000.

90,000 *6=540,000. So total 9,540,000 grams. Correct.

So 9,540,000 grams is 9.54 metric tons.

Hmm. So perhaps the correct answer is J:10 tons.

To determine how much washing soda (Na₂CO₃) is required to soften the water consumed by New York City in one day, we start by calculating the total mass of calcium sulfate (CaSO₄) in the water. The concentration of CaSO₄ is given as \(1.8 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{g/L}\), and the daily water consumption is \(6.8 \times 10^9 \, \text{L}\). 

### Step 1: Calculate the total mass of CaSO₄
\[
\text{Mass of CaSO₄} = \text{Concentration} \times \text{Volume} = (1.8 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{g/L}) \times (6.8 \times 10^9 \, \text{L})
\]
\[
\text{Mass of CaSO₄} = 1.8 \times 6.8 \times 10^6 = 12.24 \times 10^6 \, \text{g} = 12,240,000 \, \text{g}
\]

### Step 2: Convert the mass of CaSO₄ to moles
The molar mass of CaSO₄ is \(136 \, \text{g/mol}\). The number of moles of CaSO₄ is:
\[
\text{Moles of CaSO₄} = \frac{\text{Mass of CaSO₄}}{\text{Molar Mass of CaSO₄}} = \frac{12,240,000 \, \text{g}}{136 \, \text{g/mol}} = 90,000 \, \text{mol}
\]

### Step 3: Determine the moles of Na₂CO₃ required
From the reaction equation:
\[
\text{CaSO₄} + \text{Na₂CO₃} \rightarrow \text{CaCO₃} + \text{Na₂SO₄}
\]
The stoichiometry is 1:1, meaning 1 mole of Na₂CO₃ is required for every mole of CaSO₄. Therefore, the moles of Na₂CO₃ needed are also \(90,000 \, \text{mol}\).

### Step 4: Convert moles of Na₂CO₃ to mass
The molar mass of Na₂CO₃ is \(106 \, \text{g/mol}\). The total mass of Na₂CO₃ required is:
\[
\text{Mass of Na₂CO₃} = \text{Moles of Na₂CO₃} \times \text{Molar Mass of Na₂CO₃} = (90,000 \, \text{mol}) \times (106 \, \text{g/mol}) = 9,540,000 \, \text{g}
\]

### Step 5: Convert mass to metric tons
\[
\text{Mass of Na₂CO₃} = 9,540,000 \, \text{g} = 9,540 \, \text{kg} = 9.54 \, \text{metric tons}
\]

### Step 6: Match the result to the closest option
The calculated value of \(9.54 \, \text{metric tons}\) is closest to \(10 \, \text{tons}\), which corresponds to option **J**.
