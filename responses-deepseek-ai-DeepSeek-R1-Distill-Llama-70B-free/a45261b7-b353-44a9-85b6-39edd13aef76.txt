Okay, so I have this question here about finding the mass of a single carbon-12 atom when the atomic weight is exactly 12 amu. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

Wait, I remember that the atomic weight is given in atomic mass units (amu), and 1 mole of any substance has Avogadro's number of particles. Oh right, Avogadro's number is about 6.022 × 10^23 particles/mol. So if I can relate the atomic weight to grams, I can find the mass per atom.

Carbon-12's atomic weight is 12 amu, which means one mole of carbon-12 atoms has a mass of 12 grams. Because atomic weight in grams per mole is the same as the atomic mass in amu. So, 12 g/mol.

Now, to find the mass of one atom, I need to divide the molar mass by Avogadro's number. So the calculation would be mass per atom = (12 g/mol) / (6.022 × 10^23 atoms/mol).

Let me do the math. 12 divided by 6.022e23. Let's approximate. 6 times 2 is 12, so 12/6 is 2. But wait, 6.022 is a bit more than 6, so the result will be a little less than 2e-23 g. Let me compute it more accurately.

12 divided by 6.022 is approximately 1.994. So 1.994 × 10^-23 grams per atom. Looking at the options, I don't see 1.994, but option I is 2.5e-23, which is higher, and option A is 1.5e-23, which is lower. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I should compute it more precisely. Let's calculate 12 / 6.022e23:

6.022e23 is 6.022 × 10^23. So 12 / 6.022 = approximately 1.994, so 1.994e-23 grams per atom.

Looking at the options, none of them say 1.994e-23. Wait, checking the options again: the given options are A-J. Let me read them carefully.

A: 1.5 × 10^-23 g/atom

B: 1.2 ×10^-23

C: 2.0 ×10^-23

D: 3.0 ×10^-23

E: 2.7 ×10^-23

F: 2.2 ×10^-23

G:3.5

H:1.8

I:2.5

J:1.0

Hmm, so the closest is option C, which is 2.0 ×10^-23. But wait, my calculation is 1.994e-23, which is just under 2.0. So perhaps the answer is option C, 2.0e-23. But why isn't there an option closer to 1.99? Let me double-check.

Wait, maybe I should express it as 12/(6.022e23) = (12/6.022) ×1e-23.

12 divided by 6.022 equals approximately 1.994, so 1.994e-23. That's about 2.0e-23 when rounded to two significant figures, which would make option C correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a step. Wait, the molar mass is 12 g/mol, so each mole is 12 grams. Each mole has 6.022e23 atoms. So per atom, it's 12 / 6.022e23.

Yes, that's correct. So 12/(6.022e23) is approximately 1.99e-23 grams per atom, which is closest to 2.0e-23, so option C.

But wait, looking again, option I is 2.5e-23, which is 0.5 higher. Hmmm, why isn't there a closer option? Oh, maybe I miscalculated the division.

Wait, let me compute 12 / 6.022 more accurately.

6.022 * 2 = 12.044, which is just over 12. So 6.022 * 1.994 = let me compute 6 * 1.994 is 11.964, 0.022*1.994 is about 0.0439, so total is approximately 12.008. Hmm, so 6.022 * 1.994 ≈ 12.008, which is just a bit over 12. So 12/6.022 would be approximately 1.994. So 1.994e-23 grams per atom.

Looking at the options, the closest is option C, which is 2.0e-23.

Wait, but option I is 2.5e-23. Could I have made a mistake in the calculation?

Alternatively, maybe the question expects me to use a different value for Avogadro's number. Sometimes, people approximate Avogadro's number as 6e23, which would make the calculation 12/(6e23) = 2e-23 g/atom exactly, which would make option C correct.

Ah, that makes sense. If we use 6e23 as Avogadro's number, then 12/6e23 is exactly 2e-23 grams per atom. So the answer would be option C.

But wait, in reality, Avogadro's number is 6.022e23, so the exact value is about 1.99e-23, but if the question is expecting an approximate value, option C is correct.

So I think the correct answer is option C: 2.0 × 10^-23 g/atom.

To determine the mass of a single carbon-12 atom, we start with the given atomic weight of carbon-12, which is 12 amu. By definition, 1 mole of carbon-12 weighs 12 grams. Using Avogadro's number, \( 6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{atoms/mol} \), the mass of a single atom can be calculated as:

\[
\text{Mass per atom} = \frac{\text{Molar mass}}{\text{Avogadro's number}} = \frac{12 \, \text{g/mol}}{6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{atoms/mol}}
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\frac{12}{6.022} \approx 1.994 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{g/atom}
\]

This value is approximately \( 1.994 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{g/atom} \), which is very close to \( 2.0 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{g/atom} \). Among the given options, the closest match is option C: \( 2.0 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{g/atom} \).

Thus, the correct answer is:

**C: \( 2.0 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{g/atom} \)**
