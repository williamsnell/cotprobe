Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

The teeth of different species of vertebrates are special-ized in a variety of ways and may be quite unlike those of man in number , structure, arrangement, and function. Give examples .

Options:

A: Snakes have thin, sharp teeth for capturing prey; carnivorous mammals like cats and dogs have pointed teeth for cutting and shearing; herbivorous animals like cows and horses have large, flat teeth for breaking up plant cell walls.
B: Fish have teeth adapted for chewing and grinding similar to humans
C: Only carnivorous animals have specialized teeth
D: Snakes have large, flat teeth for grinding food
E: Birds have well-developed teeth for tearing meat
F: Insectivorous mammals have large, flat teeth for grinding plants
G: Rodents have fangs for injecting venom into prey
H: All vertebrates have the same number of teeth
I: Amphibians have teeth specialized for filter-feeding like some whales
J: All vertebrates have similarly structured teeth

Okay, I need to answer this multiple-choice question about the specialization of teeth in different vertebrates. Let me read the question again carefully.

The question says that vertebrates have teeth specialized in various ways, differing in number, structure, arrangement, and function. I'm supposed to give examples. The options are from A to J.

I remember that different animals have teeth adapted to their diets. For example, carnivores have sharp, pointed teeth for tearing flesh, while herbivores have broad, flat teeth for grinding plants. Let me go through each option.

Option A says snakes have thin, sharp teeth for capturing prey, which makes sense because snakes often don't chew but grab and swallow. Carnivorous mammals like cats and dogs have canines for cutting and shearing, which I know is true. Herbivores like cows have molars for grinding, so this option seems correct.

Option B says fish have teeth similar to humans for chewing and grinding. Wait, I thought most fish don't chew much; they gulp food. Some might have teeth, but not necessarily for grinding like humans. So B might be incorrect.

Option C claims only carnivorous animals have specialized teeth. That's not right because herbivores and others have specialized teeth too. So C is wrong.

Option D says snakes have large, flat teeth. No, I remember snakes have more pointed teeth, not flat. So D is incorrect.

Option E states birds have well-developed teeth. But birds typically don't have teeth; they have beaks. So E is wrong.

Option F: Insectivorous mammals have large, flat teeth for grinding plants. Wait, insectivores mainly eat insects. Some might have specialized teeth, but grinding plants sounds more like herbivores. So F might be incorrect.

Option G: Rodents have fangs. No, rodents like mice have incisors, not fangs. Fangs are more common in snakes or venomous animals. So G is wrong.

Option H says all vertebrates have the same number of teeth. No, that's not true. For example, humans have 32, while some sharks have hundreds. So H is incorrect.

Option I: Amphibians have teeth for filter-feeding like whales. Wait, whales have baleen, not teeth, for filter-feeding. Amphibians, like frogs, have small teeth for catching prey, not filtering. So I is wrong.

Option J: All vertebrates have similarly structured teeth. Definitely not, since the question states they vary. So J is wrong.

So the correct answer must be A. It correctly describes snakes with sharp teeth, carnivorous mammals with canines, and herbivores with flat teeth.

The correct answer is A because it accurately describes the specialized teeth of snakes, carnivorous mammals, and herbivorous animals, aligning with the diversity in vertebrate dental structures.

Answer: A
