Okay, so I have this physics question here about an electron moving in a magnetic field. Hmm, I remember that when a charged particle moves through a magnetic field, it experiences a force called the Lorentz force. The direction of this force depends on the charge of the particle and the direction of the magnetic field.

Wait, the question says the electron is moving upwards in the plane of the page, and the magnetic field is directed into the page. Oh right, I need to find out the direction of the circular motion and the radius of the path.

So, I think the right-hand rule applies here, but wait, the electron is negatively charged. Right-hand rule is for positive charges. So maybe I should use the left-hand rule instead. Or another way is to use the right-hand rule but remember to reverse the direction because the charge is negative.

Let me visualize this. The electron is moving upwards, and the magnetic field is into the page. So, using the right-hand rule: point my fingers in the direction of the velocity (up), then bend them into the direction of the magnetic field (which is into the page, so the palm faces down). Wait, no, the right-hand rule is when you point your thumb in the direction of velocity (for positive charge), and fingers in the magnetic field direction. Then the palm pushes in the direction of the force. But since the electron is negative, the force direction will be opposite.

So, for a positive charge, the force would be to the left or right? Let's think. Velocity is up, B is into the page. The cross product of v (up) and B (into) would be in the direction determined by the right-hand rule. The formula is F = q(v × B). So for positive charge, it'd be to the right? Wait, let me think again. The right-hand rule: if the thumb points up (v), fingers into the page (B), then the palm faces in the direction of F for positive charge. Wait, no, the cross product of v (up) and B (into) would be... Let me break it down. The magnetic field is into the page — which is the -z direction if the page is xy. Velocity is up, which is the +y direction. The cross product of y cross (-z) is what?

Wait, the cross product order matters. The formula is F = q (v × B). So when you have v in +y and B in -z, the cross product y × (-z) is -(y × z). Y × z is x, because y cross z is +x. So y × (-z) is -x. So the direction is -x, which is to the left. But wait, for a positive charge, the force would be in -x direction. But the electron is negative, so the force direction is opposite, so it would be in +x direction, to the right? Or wait, no. Wait, maybe I made a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe I should think about the initial force direction. The electron is moving upward, and the magnetic field is into the page. The magnetic force will act perpendicular to both. So, using Fleming's left-hand rule for negative charges? Or wait, Fleming's right-hand for motors is for positive charges.

Wait, maybe I'm making this more complicated. Let's think in terms of vectors. The velocity vector is upward, so let's say in the positive y-direction. The magnetic field is into the page, which is the negative z-direction. So the force F is given by F = q*(v × B). Let me plug in the vectors.

So, v is in +y, B is in -z. So v × B is y × (-z) = -(y × z). y × z is +x, so this becomes -x. So the cross product is (-x). So F is q*(-x). Since the electron's charge is negative (q = -e), F becomes (-e)*(-x) = e*x. So the force is in the +x direction, which is to the right.

Wait, but that's the initial force. Since the force is perpendicular to the velocity, it will cause the electron to move in a circular path. The direction of the circular motion would be determined by the initial force. So if the initial force is to the right, the electron starts curving to the right. So the circular motion would be clockwise or counterclockwise?

Hmm, if you imagine looking from above, the initial velocity is up, and the force is to the right. So the electron is being pushed to the right, so it starts to move in a circle. So looking from above, when the force is to the right, the motion would be clockwise. Because if something is moving up and gets a push to the right, it starts turning right, which from above would be a clockwise rotation.

Wait, but wait another moment. Let me think about the direction again. Because if the initial velocity is upward, and the force is making it move to the right, the next position would be a bit to the right and up. Wait, maybe that makes it turn right, which would be clockwise.

Alternatively, let's imagine being above the page. Velocity is up, force is right. So the electron is moving up, and being pushed right. So it's like the electron is at the top of a circle, moving up, and the force is to the right. So the circular motion would be clockwise. Because as it moves, the force makes it curve right, which would make the circle go clockwise.

So the electron starts moving up, then the force pushes it to the right, then as it moves to the right, the force direction changes. Wait, no, the force is always perpendicular. So once it starts moving right, the velocity is right, and the force would be down, because v is right and B is into the page. So the force would be F = q*(v × B). So v is right (x), B is into (-z). So v × B is x × (-z) = -(x × z) = -( -y ) = y. So the force is y direction, which is up. But wait, for an electron, the force is opposite of that.

Wait, no, perhaps I'm getting confused with the direction. Let me recalculate. Using F = q(v × B). When the electron is moving to the right (v in +x), B is into (-z). So v × B is x × (-z) = -(x × z) = - ( -y ) = y. So F is q*y. Since q is negative, F is -y. So the force is downward. So the force changes direction as the velocity changes, always pointing toward the center — which is what causes circular motion. So the center of the circle is to the left because the initial force was to the right. Hmm, perhaps I should draw a diagram.

Wait, but the initial force is to the right, so the center of the circle is in that direction. So if the electron starts moving up, with a force to the right, the circular path would have its center to the right. So from above, the motion would be clockwise because the electron is moving up, then forced right, then down, then left, and back up — that's a clockwise circle.

So the direction is clockwise. Now, what about the radius?

The radius of the circular path for a charged particle in a magnetic field is given by r = mv/(qB). Because the magnetic force provides the centripetal force: qvB = mv²/r → r = mv/(qB).

Wait, but since the charge here is negative, does that affect the radius formula? No, because the radius depends on the magnitude of the charge. The formula uses the absolute value. So the radius is (mass * velocity) divided by (charge magnitude * B).

In this case, the mass is m, velocity is v, charge is e (since q = | -e | = e), and B is B.

So r = mv/(eB).

Looking at the options, let's see. The possible options are A to J.

Option E says clockwise rotation, radius mv/(eB). Option B is counterclockwise with radius mv/(eB). So direction is key here.

Wait, earlier I thought the direction was clockwise because the initial force was to the right, leading the electron into a clockwise circle. So the correct option should have clockwise and radius mv/(eB).

Looking through options:

E: Clockwise rotation; radius mv/(eB). That's option E.

Another option: F — same direction but radius mv*eB. No, that's not right.

So the answer is E.

When an electron moves through a magnetic field, it experiences a force known as the Lorentz force, given by **F = q(v × B)**. The direction of this force depends on the charge of the particle and the relative directions of its velocity and the magnetic field. For an electron, which has a negative charge, the force direction is opposite to that predicted by the right-hand rule.

In this scenario, the electron is moving upward in the plane of the page, and the magnetic field is directed into the page. Using the right-hand rule for a positive charge, the force would initially point to the left. However, since the electron is negatively charged, the force direction is reversed, and the initial force points to the right. This force acts as the centripetal force, causing the electron to move in a circular path.

The radius of the circular motion is determined by the equation **r = mv/(qB)**, where:
- \( m \) is the mass of the electron,
- \( v \) is its velocity,
- \( q \) is the magnitude of its charge (\( e \)),
- \( B \) is the magnetic field strength.

Substituting the given values, the radius of the electron's path is \( r = mv/(eB) \).

As for the direction of the circular motion, the initial force to the right causes the electron to begin curving in a clockwise direction when viewed from above. Thus, the electron undergoes clockwise circular motion with a radius of \( mv/(eB) \).

From the provided options, the correct choice is:

**E: Clockwise rotation; radius of path = mv/(eB)**.

Answer: E
