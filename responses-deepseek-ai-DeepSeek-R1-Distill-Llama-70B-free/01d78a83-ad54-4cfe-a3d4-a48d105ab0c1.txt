Okay, so I've got this problem here about finding the molecular weight of sugar using osmotic pressure. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the problem says that a sugar solution was made by dissolving 9.0 grams of sugar in 500 grams of water. The temperature is 27°C, and the osmotic pressure is 2.46 atm. I need to find the molecular weight of the sugar from the given options.

Wait, osmotic pressure... I remember there's a formula that relates osmotic pressure to concentration. Oh right! The formula is π = iMRT. Where π is the osmotic pressure, i is the van't Hoff factor, M is the molarity, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

Wait, but wait. For sugars, which are nonelectrolytes, the van't Hoff factor i is 1 because they don't dissociate in solution. So i equals 1 here. That simplifies things a bit.

So the formula becomes π = MRT. But wait, M is molarity, which is moles per liter. Oh, but I have grams of sugar and grams of water. So I think I should calculate the number of moles of sugar and then find the molarity.

Let me jot down the steps:

1. Calculate moles of sugar using molecular weight (Mw). Moles = mass / Mw. But since I don't know Mw yet, that's the unknown. Hmm, maybe I can rearrange the formula to solve for Mw.

2. Find the volume of the solution to get molarity. Wait, but the solution's volume isn't directly given. Oh wait, I have 500 grams of water. Assuming the volume is approximately equal to the water's volume because sugar might contribute a small amount. But that's an approximation. Alternatively, perhaps the solution's volume is close to 500 mL since 500 g water is roughly 0.5 liters (since 1 g/mL is water's density). So maybe the volume is about 500 mL + a bit from the sugar, but perhaps negligible? Or maybe I should calculate it more accurately.

Wait, but maybe I can approach it by using the formula and solving for Mw directly.

Let me think. The osmotic pressure equation is π = (n/V)RT, because M = n/V, and i=1. So π = (n/V)RT.

n is moles of sugar, which is mass / Mw. So n = 9.0 g / Mw.

V is the volume in liters. Wait, but I have 500 g of water. The volume of water is 500 mL, but when sugar dissolves, the volume might change a bit. But perhaps for dilute solutions, the volume is approximately the volume of water. So V ≈ 0.5 L.

Wait, but let me check. So the solution is 9g sugar in 500g water. 9g sugar is like 9/342 = ~0.0263 moles (if Mw is 342). Then concentration is 0.0263 / 0.5 L = 0.0526 M. But wait, the osmotic pressure given is 2.46 atm. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the formula in terms of mass and volume.

So, let's write the formula again:

π = (n/V) RT

n = mass of solute / Mw = 9.0 g / Mw.

V is the volume in liters. But the mass of the solvent is 500g, so volume ≈ 500 mL = 0.5 L. That's an assumption, but maybe it's okay for this problem.

So, substituting:

2.46 atm = (9.0 / Mw) / 0.5 L * R * T

Wait, let me plug in the numbers correctly. R is the gas constant. Which value of R should I use? Since pressure is in atm, R is 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K).

Temperature is 27°C, which is 300 K (since 27 + 273 = 300).

So putting it all together:

2.46 = (9.0 / Mw) / 0.5 * 0.0821 * 300

Let me compute the right-hand side step by step.

First, compute (9.0 / Mw) / 0.5 → that's (9.0) / (0.5 Mw) ) → 18 / Mw.

Then, multiply by 0.0821 and 300:

18/Mw * 0.0821 * 300.

Compute 0.0821 * 300 first. 0.0821 * 300 = 24.63.

So now, 18/Mw * 24.63 = (18 *24.63)/ Mw.

Compute 18 *24.63: 18 *24 is 432, 18*0.63=11.34 → total 443.34.

So 443.34 / Mw.

So equation is:

2.46 = 443.34 / Mw.

Solving for Mw: Mw = 443.34 / 2.46.

Let me compute that. 443.34 ÷ 2.46.

Hmm, let's see. 2.46 * 180 = 442.8. Because 2.46 * 100=246, 2.46*80=196.8 → 246+196.8=442.8.

Wait, 2.46 * 180 = 442.8.

So 443.34 is a bit more, so Mw ≈ 180. So 443.34 / 2.46 ≈ 180.2.

Looking at the options, option A is 180 g/mol. So the answer should be A.

But wait, let me double-check the calculation because sometimes I might have made a mistake.

Wait, let me recompute 0.0821 * 300. 0.0821 * 300: 0.08*300=24, 0.0021*300=0.63. So total 24.63. That's correct.

Then 9.0 grams / Mw, divided by 0.5 L → (9/Mw) / 0.5 = 18/Mw.

Multiply by 24.63: 18 *24.63 = let's compute 18 *24 = 432, 18 *0.63= 11.34 → 443.34.

So 443.34/Mw = 2.46 atm → Mw=443.34/2.46 ≈ 180.2 g/mol.

So that's option A.

Wait, but why is the option B 342? Oh, 342 is the molar mass of sucrose. But perhaps the problem is about glucose, which is 180. Or maybe it's a different sugar. So the correct answer would be 180, which is option A.

To determine the molecular weight (Mw) of the sugar, we use the osmotic pressure formula:

\[
\pi = \frac{n}{V} RT
\]

Where:
- \( \pi = 2.46 \, \text{atm} \) (osmotic pressure),
- \( n = \frac{\text{mass of solute}}{\text{Mw}} = \frac{9.0 \, \text{g}}{\text{Mw}} \) (moles of solute),
- \( V = 0.5 \, \text{L} \) (volume of the solution, approximated as the volume of water, since 500 g of water is approximately 500 mL or 0.5 L),
- \( R = 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \) (gas constant),
- \( T = 27^\circ \text{C} + 273 = 300 \, \text{K} \) (temperature in Kelvin).

Substituting the values into the formula:

\[
2.46 = \frac{\frac{9.0}{\text{Mw}}}{0.5} \cdot 0.0821 \cdot 300
\]

Simplify step by step:
1. \( \frac{\frac{9.0}{\text{Mw}}}{0.5} = \frac{18}{\text{Mw}} \),
2. Multiply by \( 0.0821 \cdot 300 = 24.63 \):  
   \[
   \frac{18}{\text{Mw}} \cdot 24.63 = \frac{443.34}{\text{Mw}}
   \],
3. Set equal to \( 2.46 \):  
   \[
   2.46 = \frac{443.34}{\text{Mw}}
   \],
4. Solve for \( \text{Mw} \):  
   \[
   \text{Mw} = \frac{443.34}{2.46} \approx 180.2 \, \text{g/mol}.
   \]

Thus, the molecular weight of the sugar is approximately \( 180 \, \text{g/mol} \), which corresponds to option A. While 342 g/mol (option B) is the molar mass of sucrose, the calculation here suggests the sugar in question has a molar mass closer to 180 g/mol, likely glucose.
