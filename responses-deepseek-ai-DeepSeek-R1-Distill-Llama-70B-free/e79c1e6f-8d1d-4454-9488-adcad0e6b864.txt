Question:

A permanent resident alien applied for a position as a state trooper. A state trooper is a member of the state police force, a law enforcement body that exercises broad police authority throughout the state. The position of state trooper is filled on the basis of competitive examinations taken by all of the applicants. After the resident alien applied for the position, the state authorities refused him permission to take the qualifying examination. The state authorities based their refusal on state statute, which provided:"No person shall become a member of the state police unless he/she shall be a citizen of the United States. "Thus, under this provision, as a prerequisite to becoming a member of the state police, an alien must relinquish his foreign citizenship and become a citizen. In an opinion upholding the validity of the statute, the State Attorney General noted that since police officers fall within the category of important non-elective officials who participate directly in the execution of broad public policy, only citizens of the United States should be qualified to apply for such positions. "At the time the resident alien applied for a position as a state trooper, he was a citizen of a foreign country and not currently eligible for citizenship. As a result of a federal statute, Congress has imposed a five-year residency requirement for the attainment of citizenship. Under this federal law, an alien must reside in this country for a period of five years as a prerequisite before applying for citizenship. At this time, the resident alien had only lawfully been residing in the United States for two years, and thus would not be eligible to apply for naturalization until three years later. If the resident alien brings suit in federal court challenging the constitutionality of the state statute limiting the membership of its state police force to citizens of the United States, the court will most likely declare the statute

Options:

A: constitutional, because citizenship bears a rational relationship to the special demands of the police function.
B: unconstitutional, because it constitutes a violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
C: constitutional, as it falls under the state's right to regulate its own law enforcement bodies.
D: unconstitutional, as it infringes on the resident alien's right to seek employment.
E: unconstitutional, because it constitutes a violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
F: unconstitutional, because it is an unfair restriction on the resident alien's opportunity for employment.
G: constitutional, because the statute is within the state's plenary power to regulate the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens.
H: unconstitutional, because it violates the resident alien's rights under the Fifth Amendment.
I: constitutional, because the statute does not specifically discriminate against any particular nationality or ethnicity.

Alright, so I've got this question about constitutional law, specifically dealing with the rights of resident aliens and state statutes. Hmm, let me try to break it down.

Okay, the situation is a permanent resident alien applied to be a state trooper. The state refused to let him take the exam because of a state statute that requires all state police members to be U.S. citizens. The statute says no one can join unless they're a citizen, so the alien has to give up his foreign citizenship and become a citizen here. 

The state's Attorney General defended the statute by saying police officers are important officials who carry out public policy, so only citizens should qualify. The alien here is a citizen of another country and isn't eligible for U.S. citizenship yet because of a five-year residency requirementâ€”he's only been here two years.

Now, the question is if the alien sues in federal court, what would the court likely decide about the statute's constitutionality.

I remember that the Supreme Court has dealt with cases where states restrict certain public positions to citizens. One case that comes to mind is Sugarman v. Dougall, where the Court struck down a law requiring civil service employees to be citizens. The Court held that such restrictions violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment because citizenship requirements often disproportionately affect aliens, and the state must show a compelling interest to justify such discrimination.

Wait, but what about law enforcement? Police officers have significant authority, so maybe the state has a stronger argument there. I think in the case of Bernal v. Fainter, the Court upheld a Texas law requiring notaries public to be citizens. But wait, no, actually in that case, the Court held that the law violated equal protection because being a notary didn't involve enough governmental responsibility to justify the citizenship requirement.

Another case, Foley v. Connelie, dealt with police officers. In that case, the Supreme Court upheld a New York law requiring police officers to be citizens. The Court reasoned that law enforcement officers are involved in functions that are central to the state's responsibility for the safety of its citizens, so the citizenship requirement was justified.

Wait, so in Foley, the Court said that because police officers are involved in the execution of public policy and broad public authority, the state's interest in ensuring their loyalty and commitment to the U.S. was sufficient to justify the citizenship requirement.

So applying that here, the state's statute would likely be upheld as constitutional because it relates to a position that's integral to public safety and policy execution. Therefore, the court would probably find the statute constitutional.

Looking at the options:

Option A says it's constitutional because citizenship relates to the special demands of police work. That aligns with the Foley reasoning.

Option B says it's unconstitutional under Equal Protection. But in Foley, the Court allowed it, so B might not be correct.

Option C talks about the state's right to regulate law enforcement. That's a possible angle, but the more precise reasoning is about the nature of the job.

Option G mentions the state's plenary power over health, safety, and welfare. That's a broad statement but might not directly address the issue.

So I think the correct answer is A.

The question revolves around the constitutionality of a state statute requiring state troopers to be U.S. citizens, challenged by a permanent resident alien. The state justifies the requirement based on the significant role of police officers in executing public policy and ensuring safety. Relevant case law includes *Foley v. Connelie*, where the Supreme Court upheld a citizenship requirement for police officers, reasoning that their role in public safety and policy execution justifies such a restriction. This aligns with the state's argument here. While other cases like *Sugarman v. Dougall* struck down broader citizenship requirements, the unique responsibilities of law enforcement officers make this case distinct. Therefore, the statute is likely constitutional due to the rational relationship between citizenship and the demands of the police function.
