Okay, so I have this physics problem here about electric fields and charges. Let me try to break it down. Hmm, I remember that electric field due to a point charge is given by E = kq / r², where k is Coulomb's constant, q is the charge, and r is the distance from the charge.

The setup is that there's a charge -q1 at the origin on the x-axis. So the point is (0,0). Then, another charge of -4q1 is placed somewhere on the x-axis, and we need to find where to place it so that the net electric field is zero at x=2.0 mm.

Wait, net electric field zero at x=2 mm. So I need to find the position of the second charge so that the fields from both charges at x=2 mm cancel each other out.

Let me visualize the scenario. The first charge is at x=0, and the second charge is somewhere else on the x-axis, let's say at position x=d. We need to find d such that E_total at x=2 mm is zero.

Since both charges are negative, their electric fields will be in the same direction if they are on the same side, but opposite if they are on opposite sides. Hmm, but wait, the direction depends on where the test point is relative to the charges.

Wait, the test point is at x=2 mm. So where can the second charge be? Let me consider possibilities. If the second charge is placed to the left of the origin, then the field from that charge at x=2 mm would be pointing to the left. The field from the first charge (at origin) at x=2 mm is pointing to the left as well because it's negative. So if both fields are to the left, they can't cancel each other. So maybe the second charge should be placed to the right of the test point.

Wait, no. Because if the second charge is to the right of x=2 mm, then its field at x=2 mm would be pointing to the right (since negative charges create fields pointing towards them). The first charge is at origin, so its field at 2 mm points to the left (since charge is negative). So if the second charge is to the right of 2 mm, then E1 (from origin) is left, E2 (from second charge) is right. So they can cancel each other if their magnitudes are equal.

Alternatively, if the second charge is placed between the origin and the test point (so between 0 and 2 mm), then the field from the second charge at 2 mm would point to the left (since it's negative and the test point is to the right of it). So both E1 and E2 would be pointing left, making the total field stronger in that direction, which can't be zero. So that's not the case.

So the second charge must be placed to the right of the test point. So at some d > 2 mm.

Wait, but let me think again. No, if the second charge is placed at d > 2 mm, then the field from the second charge at 2 mm would point to the right because the charge is negative, so the field direction is towards it. But the field from the origin (q1) at 2 mm is pointing to the left because it's negative. So E1 (origin) is left, E2 (second charge) is right.

So for the net field to be zero, E1 must equal E2 in magnitude but opposite in direction. So E1 = E2.

So let's write the equations.

E1 is the field from the first charge at x=2 mm.

E1 = k*(-q1) / (2 mm)^2. Wait, no, the magnitude is k q / r². Direction is left because the charge is negative.

E2 is the field from the second charge at x=2 mm. The second charge is at d mm. So the distance between the second charge and the test point is (d - 2) mm, since d is greater than 2.

E2 = k*(4 q1) / (d-2)^2. Wait, no, the second charge is -4 q1, so the magnitude is 4 q1. Direction is to the right (since the test point is to the left of the second charge, so the field points towards the charge, which is to the right).

So E1 to the left, E2 to the right. So E1 = E2 in magnitude.

So set their magnitudes equal:

k q1 / (2)^2 = k*(4 q1) / (d-2)^2.

Wait, let me plug in the numbers correctly. The first charge is -q1, and the second is -4q1, but the magnitude for E is just the absolute value, so:

E1 = k * q1 / (2 mm)^2

E2 = k * (4 q1) / (d - 2 mm)^2

Wait, but wait, the distance for E2 is (d - 2), but d is in mm. So maybe I should convert everything to meters later, but for now, let's just keep it in mm.

Wait, but the units should be consistent. Actually, when calculating in E = k q / r², r should be in meters, but since all terms are in mm, perhaps I can just keep the ratios. Let me see.

Wait, let me write the equation without the constants. Since k and q1 are present in both terms, they will cancel out.

So,

q1 / (2)^2 = (4 q1) / (d - 2)^2.

Wait, but wait, no, the charges are different. The first charge is q1, the second is 4 q1, but both are negative. So the magnitudes are q1 and 4 q1.

So the equation is:

(q1) / (2^2) = (4 q1) / (d-2)^2.

Yes, because E1 (from -q1) is k q1 / (2)^2 to the left, E2 (from -4 q1) is k (4 q1) / (d-2)^2 to the right.

Setting E1 = E2 in magnitude:

(q1)/(4) = (4 q1)/(d-2)^2.

Now, I can cancel q1 from both sides (since q1 is non-zero).

1/4 = 4 / (d-2)^2

Multiply both sides by (d-2)^2:

(d-2)^2 * (1/4) = 4

Multiply both sides by 4:

(d-2)^2 = 16

Take square root:

d - 2 = 4 or d - 2 = -4.

So d = 6 mm or d = -2 mm.

But wait, earlier we reasoned that the second charge must be to the right of the test point (x=2 mm). So d must be greater than 2 mm. So d =6 mm is acceptable, d=-2 mm is not, because that's to the left of the origin, which would cause both fields to point in the same direction (to the left), making cancellation impossible.

So the correct position is d =6 mm, which is option F.

Wait, the options are A to J. Let me see the options again.

Option F is 6.0 mm. So the answer is F.

To solve the problem, we analyze the electric fields produced by the two charges at the test point located at \( x = 2.0 \, \mathrm{mm} \). The first charge, \( -q_1 \), is at the origin (\( x = 0 \)), and the second charge, \( -4q_1 \), is placed at an unknown position \( x = d \) on the \( x \)-axis. The goal is to find \( d \) such that the net electric field at \( x = 2.0 \, \mathrm{mm} \) is zero.

### Key Observations:
1. The electric field due to a point charge is given by \( E = \frac{kq}{r^2} \), where \( k \) is Coulomb's constant, \( q \) is the charge, and \( r \) is the distance from the charge to the point of interest.
2. Since both charges are negative, the electric field they produce at the test point will point toward the respective charges.
3. For the net electric field to be zero at \( x = 2.0 \, \mathrm{mm} \), the magnitudes of the fields from the two charges must be equal, and their directions must oppose each other.

### Analysis:
- The field from the first charge (\( -q_1 \)) at \( x = 2.0 \, \mathrm{mm} \) is:
  \[
  E_1 = \frac{k q_1}{(2.0)^2} = \frac{k q_1}{4.0}.
  \]
  This field points to the left (toward the origin).

- The field from the second charge (\( -4q_1 \)) at \( x = 2.0 \, \mathrm{mm} \) depends on its position \( d \). The distance between the second charge and the test point is \( |d - 2.0| \). The field is:
  \[
  E_2 = \frac{k (4q_1)}{(d - 2.0)^2}.
  \]
  This field points to the right (toward the second charge if \( d > 2.0 \)).

- For the fields to cancel, their magnitudes must be equal:
  \[
  \frac{k q_1}{4.0} = \frac{k (4q_1)}{(d - 2.0)^2}.
  \]

### Solving for \( d \):
1. Cancel \( k q_1 \) from both sides:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4.0} = \frac{4}{(d - 2.0)^2}.
   \]

2. Multiply through by \( (d - 2.0)^2 \):
   \[
   (d - 2.0)^2 \cdot \frac{1}{4.0} = 4.
   \]

3. Simplify:
   \[
   (d - 2.0)^2 = 16.
   \]

4. Take the square root:
   \[
   d - 2.0 = \pm 4.0.
   \]

5. Solve for \( d \):
   \[
   d = 6.0 \, \mathrm{mm} \quad \text{or} \quad d = -2.0 \, \mathrm{mm}.
   \]

### Final Consideration:
- If \( d = -2.0 \, \mathrm{mm} \), the second charge would be to the left of the origin. In this case, both fields would point to the left, making cancellation impossible.
- If \( d = 6.0 \, \mathrm{mm} \), the second charge is to the right of the test point. The field from the first charge points to the left, and the field from the second charge points to the right, allowing for cancellation.

Thus, the correct position for the second charge is \( d = 6.0 \, \mathrm{mm} \).

### Answer:
F
