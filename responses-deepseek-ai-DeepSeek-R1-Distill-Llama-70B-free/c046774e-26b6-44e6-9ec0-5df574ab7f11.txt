Okay, so I've got this accounting problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let's take it step by step. 

The problem says that Jones House Furnishings bought some items from Howard Hardware. The total list price is $165.06, but they got discounts of 8% and 5%, bringing the net price down to $144.27. Now, they need to pay this amount, and there are discount terms of (3/10) and (n/60). 

The questions are: 
(a) How much will Jones pay if they pay on August 12?
(b) What if they pay on August 14?

So first, I need to understand what these discount terms mean. I remember that terms like (3/10) mean that if you pay within 10 days, you get a 3% discount. But wait, the way it's written here is (3/10) and (n/60). Hmm, I think this is probably (3/10, n/60), which is a common way to write payment terms. So it's 3% discount if paid within 10 days, and then net due in 60 days if you don't take the discount.

Wait, but the way the problem states it is "discount terms of (3/10) and (n/60)". Oh, maybe it's 3% for 10 days and something else for 60. But I think more likely, the terms are 3% discount if paid within 10 days, otherwise the full amount is due in 60 days. So n here might be the normal rate, but perhaps it's just a placeholder. Hmm, but in the problem, the net price is $144.27, so maybe the discounts are already applied, and now the payment terms apply on this net amount.

Wait, the list price was $165.06, and after discounts of 8% and 5%, they got to $144.27. Let me check that calculation. So 8% of 165.06 is 0.08 *165.06 = 13.2048. 5% is 0.05*165.06=8.253. Adding those two discounts gives 13.2048 +8.253=21.4578. So the total discount is approximately $21.46, which when subtracted from $165.06 gives about $143.60. But wait, the problem says it's $144.27. Hmm, maybe I'm miscalculating. Wait, perhaps the discounts are applied one after the other. Let me think: 8% off first, then 5% off the discounted amount. So 165.06 * 0.92 = let's see, 165.06 *0.92: 165 *0.92 is 151.8, plus 0.06*0.92=0.0552, so total 151.8552. Then 5% off that: 151.8552 *0.95 = let's calculate that. 151.8552 *0.95: 151.8552 - (151.8552 *0.05). 0.05 of 151.8552 is 7.59276, so 151.8552-7.59276=144.26244, which rounds to $144.26 or $144.27. So that's correct. So the net price is $144.27.

Now, the payment terms are (3/10) and (n/60). I think that's 3% discount if paid within 10 days, or net in 60 days. So if Jones pays within 10 days, they take an additional 3% off the net amount. Otherwise, they pay the full net amount within 60 days.

So the first part (a) is asking what happens if they pay on August 12. Let's see when the invoice is dated. Oh, the invoice is from August 3. So August 3 is the invoice date. So the 10-day period would be from August 3 to August 13 (since the 10th day is August 13, as days are counted inclusively). Wait, no, let me think: if the invoice is on the 3rd, then day 1 is the 4th, day 2 is 5th, ..., day 10 is August 13. So August 12 is the 9th day. So if they pay on the 12th, which is within the 10-day window, they can take the 3% discount.

So for part (a), the payment date is August 12, which is within 10 days of August 3. So they get a 3% discount on the net amount of $144.27. So the calculation is 144.27 * (1 - 0.03) = 144.27 * 0.97. Let's compute that. 

Let me calculate 144.27 * 0.97. Hmm, 144 *0.97 is (140*0.97)+(4*0.97) = 135.8 + 3.88 = 139.68. Then 0.27 *0.97 is 0.2619. So total is 139.68 + 0.2619 = 139.9419, which is approximately $139.94.

So part (a) is $139.94.

Now part (b) is if they pay on August 14. Let's see, August 3 is day 0, so August 14 is 11 days later. So that's beyond the 10-day window. So they don't get the 3% discount, so they have to pay the full net amount of $144.27. But wait, the terms are (3/10, n/60), which I think is 3% discount if paid within 10 days, else payment is due in 60 days. So if they don't pay within 10 days, they don't get the discount, and have to pay the full $144.27 by day 60. But in this question, part (b) is asking what the payment would be if made on August 14, which is 11 days after the invoice date, so they don't qualify for the discount. So they pay the full $144.27.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check the options. Option I is $139.94 and $144.27. That would match part (a) as $139.94 and part (b) as $144.27. So that's option I.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recheck the calculation for part (a). 3% of 144.27 is 4.3281. So 144.27 -4.3281 = 139.9419, which is $139.94. Correct.

So the answers are (a) $139.94 and (b) $144.27. Looking at the options, that's option I: $139.94 and $144.27.

To solve the problem, we start by understanding the payment terms and the discounts applied. The invoice date is August 3, and the net price after discounts is $144.27. The payment terms are (3/10, n/60), which means a 3% discount is available if payment is made within 10 days; otherwise, the full amount is due within 60 days.

### Part (a): Payment on August 12
- August 12 is within the 10-day discount period (August 3 to August 13). Therefore, Jones Furnishings is eligible for the 3% discount on the net price of $144.27.
- The discount amount is calculated as:  
  \[
  144.27 \times 0.03 = 4.3281
  \]
- Subtracting the discount from the net price:  
  \[
  144.27 - 4.3281 = 139.9419 \approx 139.94
  \]
- Thus, the payment on August 12 is **$139.94**.

### Part (b): Payment on August 14
- August 14 is outside the 10-day discount period, so no discount is applied. Jones Furnishings must pay the full net price of $144.27.
- Therefore, the payment on August 14 is **$144.27**.

### Final Answer
The payment amounts are:
- (a) $139.94 if paid on August 12.
- (b) $144.27 if paid on August 14.

From the given options, the correct choice is **I: $139.94 and $144.27**.
