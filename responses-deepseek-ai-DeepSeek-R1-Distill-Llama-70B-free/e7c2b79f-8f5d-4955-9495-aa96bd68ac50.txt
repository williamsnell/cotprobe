Question:

An athlete hoped to sign a contract with a professional baseball team to play baseball. He had succeeded in arranging for a tryout at the baseball team's training facilities in a neighboring state. Short on funds and needing a way to get to the training facilities, the athlete approached his friend and said, "If you will drive me to and from the baseball team's training facilities for my tryout and pay for our housing and meal expenses during our stay, I will assign to you 10 percent of my first-year earnings. " The friend agreed and drove the athlete to the training facilities. After the tryout, the baseball team offered the athlete a contract to play baseball for the team at $100,000 per year. When the friend asked when he would be receiving his 10 percent, the athlete replied that $10,000 was much more than the friend deserved and he would pay the friend $1,000 for his efforts. The friend then filed suit to enforce the assignment. If the court holds the assignment unenforceable, the most applicable legal principle would be

Options:

A: the assignment was not in writing, therefore it is not enforceable.
B: a purported assignment of a right expected to arise under a contract not in existence operates only as a promise to assign the right when it arises and as a power to enforce it.
C: the assignment was not fair and reasonable, therefore it can be revoked.
D: the athlete was under duress when making the assignment, rendering it unenforceable.
E: the assignment is unenforceable because the athlete's contract with the baseball team prohibited any assignment of earnings.
F: the friend did not provide a valuable consideration in return for the assignment.
G: an assignment of a right expected to arise from a future event is enforceable once the event occurs.
H: a contract to make a future assignment of a right is not a validly enforceable assignment.
I: the friend did not detrimentally rely on the assignment prior to the attempted revocation of the assignment by the athlete.
J: a gratuitous assignment is revocable, and the right of the assignee is terminated by the assignor's subsequent revocation.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this law question, and I need to think it through carefully. Let me start by reading the question again and breaking it down.

So, the situation is about an athlete and his friend. The athlete wants to try out for a baseball team but doesn't have enough money. He asks his friend to drive him to and from the training facilities and cover their housing and meal expenses. In exchange, the athlete offers to assign 10% of his first-year earnings to the friend. The friend agrees and drives him. Then, the athlete gets a contract for $100k a year. When the friend asks for his 10% ($10k), the athlete only offers $1k, so the friend sues to enforce the assignment.

The question is about why the court might find the assignment unenforceable. The options are from A to J, each presenting a different legal principle.

First, I remember that assignments of future rights can be tricky. I think that when you assign a right that hasn't come into existence yet, it's not automatically enforceable. There's something about how such assignments are treated as a promise to assign once the right arises, rather than a present transfer.

Looking at the options, option B says: "a purported assignment of a right expected to arise under a contract not in existence operates only as a promise to assign the right when it arises and as a power to enforce it." That sounds familiar. So if the assignment is of a future right, it's just a promise, not an immediate transfer. So the friend might not have an enforceable assignment yet.

Option F says the friend didn't provide consideration. Wait, the friend did drive and pay expenses. That seems like consideration. So F might not be the right answer.

Option J talks about gratuitous assignments being revocable. But here, the athlete was getting something (transportation and expenses), so it's not a gift. So J might not apply.

Option A is about not being in writing. I think some assignments require writing under the Statute of Frauds, like assignments of contracts for personal services. But I'm not sure if this particular assignment would fall under that. Also, the question doesn't mention anything about a writing, so maybe A isn't the main issue here.

Option B seems more about the timing of the assignment. Since the contract with the team didn't exist when the assignment was made, it's a future right. So the assignment would only be a promise to assign once the right exists. But if that's the case, would the friend be able to enforce it? Or does the assignor still have the right to revoke it before the contract is made?

Wait, there's a concept that an assignment of future rights is enforceable once the right comes into existence, but maybe it's treated as a promise to assign, not an immediate transfer. So when the right arises (the contract), the assignment should take effect. But I'm a bit confused here.

Alternatively, I remember that a contract to assign future rights is not the same as an immediate assignment. So maybe the athlete didn't actually assign the right yet; he just promised to do so in the future. If that's the case, the friend can't enforce it unless there's consideration for the promise. Wait, but the friend did provide consideration by driving him and paying expenses. So maybe the promise is enforceable as part of the contract.

Wait, the initial agreement was an exchange: friend provides services and expenses in return for 10% of the earnings. So that's a current contract where the athlete is promising to assign a portion of his future earnings as consideration. So I think that such an assignment, when the right comes into being, becomes enforceable.

But then why would the court hold it unenforceable? Maybe because the assignment was of a right expected to arise under a future contract, which wasn't in existence yet. So the assignment is only a promise, and the friend can't enforce it unless the athlete actually assigns it once the contract is made. But the athlete backed out, so the friend can't force it.

Wait, but the athlete actually got the contract. So the future right did come into existence. So under option B, the assignment would operate as a promise to assign once it arises. But does that mean it's enforceable now?

Alternatively, perhaps the assignment is treated as a present transfer of a future right, but I think that's possible. So I'm a bit stuck here.

Let me think about the options again. Option B says it's only a promise to assign, not an actual assignment. So the friend can't enforce it as an assignment but might have a claim for breach of contract if the athlete didn't assign. But in this case, the friend is trying to enforce the assignment, not suing for breach.

Another angle: some jurisdictions require consideration for an assignment. The friend provided consideration, so the assignment should be valid. So F is probably not the issue.

Option J says that a gratuitous assignment is revocable. But this wasn't a gift; the athlete received something, so J doesn't apply.

Option B seems to suggest that the assignment is merely a promise, not an actual transfer. So if the court holds it unenforceable as an assignment, the reason would be that it's just a promise, and the friend can't enforce the assignment itself. Instead, the friend would have to sue for breach of that promise, which is a different claim.

Wait, but the friend is suing to enforce the assignment, not for breach of contract. So if the assignment isn't valid, the court can't enforce it as an assignment. Therefore, the applicable principle would be option B.

So the answer should be B.

The question revolves around the enforceability of an assignment of future earnings. The athlete promised his friend 10% of his first-year earnings in exchange for transportation and expenses related to a tryout. When the athlete later refused to pay the agreed amount, the friend sued to enforce the assignment. The issue is determining why the court might find the assignment unenforceable.

Key points to consider:

1. **Future Rights Assignment**: The assignment was made before the athlete had a contract with the baseball team. Under the law, an assignment of a right expected to arise under a future contract is generally treated as a promise to assign the right once it materializes, rather than a present transfer of the right.

2. **Option B Analysis**: Option B states that such an assignment operates only as a promise to assign the right when it arises and as a power to enforce it. This aligns with the principle that assignments of future rights are not immediately enforceable but rather constitute a commitment to assign once the right comes into existence.

3. **Consideration**: The friend provided consideration by driving the athlete and covering expenses, so the lack of consideration is not the issue here. Thus, Option F is not applicable.

4. **Gratuitous Assignment**: The assignment was not gratuitous, as the athlete received something in exchange. Therefore, Option J, which pertains to revocable gratuitous assignments, does not apply.

5. **Writing Requirement**: While some assignments require a writing under the Statute of Frauds, the question does not indicate that this was the basis for unenforceability. Hence, Option A is unlikely to be the correct answer.

6. **Enforceability as a Promise**: The assignment is enforceable as a promise to assign once the right arises, but the friend is suing to enforce the assignment itself. If the court holds the assignment unenforceable, it is because the assignment was merely a promise, not a present transfer of rights.

Based on this analysis, the most applicable legal principle is that the assignment was a promise to assign future rights, not an immediately enforceable transfer. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**B: a purported assignment of a right expected to arise under a contract not in existence operates only as a promise to assign the right when it arises and as a power to enforce it.**

Answer: B
