Okay, so I have this question about the real exchange rate, and I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but let's try to work through it step by step. 

Alright, the question is about calculating the real exchange rate between the Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) and the US Dollar (USD) from 2010 to 2019. Hmm, I remember that the real exchange rate takes into account the nominal exchange rate adjusted for inflation differentials between the two countries. 

Let me jot down the given data. In 2010, the exchange rate was IDR 15,000 per USD. Both countries had a consumer price index (CPI) of 100. Then, in 2019, the nominal exchange rate changed to IDR 14,000 per USD. Indonesia's CPI rose to 105, which means their inflation was 5%. The US CPI went up to 110, so their inflation was 10%. 

Wait, so the formula for the real exchange rate, if I recall correctly, is the nominal exchange rate multiplied by the ratio of the foreign country's CPI to the domestic country's CPI. Or is it the other way around? Oh right, the real exchange rate formula is:

Real Exchange Rate = Nominal Exchange Rate × (Foreign CPI / Domestic CPI)

But wait, sometimes I get confused about which country is considered 'foreign' in this context. Let me think: since we're looking at the exchange rate from Indonesia's perspective, the domestic country is Indonesia, and the foreign is the US. So the formula should be:

Real Exchange Rate (IDR/USD) = Nominal Exchange Rate (IDR/USD) × (CPI_US / CPI_ID)

Wait, that doesn't sound right. Because if the US CPI increases more than Indonesia's, the real exchange rate should reflect changes in purchasing power. Let me make sure.

Alternatively, another approach is to use the formula:

Real Exchange Rate = Nominal Exchange Rate × (Domestic CPI / Foreign CPI)

Wait, I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me clarify. The real exchange rate shows the ratio of the price of foreign goods to domestic goods. So if domestic prices (Indonesia) rise more than foreign (US), the real exchange rate should depreciate, meaning more IDR per USD in real terms. Or wait, no, higher domestic inflation would mean the real exchange rate increases? Hmm.

Alternatively, another way to compute it is:

Real Exchange Rate = (Nominal Exchange Rate × Domestic CPI) / Foreign CPI

Wait, that might make more sense. Let's think: the nominal exchange rate is IDR per USD. Multiplying by the domestic CPI (Indonesia's) and then dividing by the foreign CPI (US) would adjust for the inflation in both countries.

Wait, let's see. The general formula is:

Real Exchange Rate = Nominal Exchange Rate × (Price Level of Foreign Country / Price Level of Domestic Country)

And since CPI is a measure of the price level, we can use CPI values. So, the formula would be:

Real Exchange Rate = Nominal Exchange Rate × (CPI_US / CPI_ID)

Wait, but that would mean if the US CPI increases more, the real exchange rate increases. Let me think in terms of example: suppose the nominal exchange rate stays the same, but the US has higher inflation. That would mean that USD can buy more in their own country because their prices are higher, so in real terms, each USD is stronger. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Anyway, let's proceed with the data given.

In 2019, the nominal exchange rate is IDR14,000/USD.

Indonesia's CPI in 2019 is 105 (up from 100 in 2010), and the US CPI is 110 (up from 100 as well). So the change in CPI for both countries is:

CPI_ID_2019 = 105
CPI_US_2019 = 110

Wait, but the formula for real exchange rate can also be calculated using the ratio of the current CPI to the base year. Since 2010 is the base year with CPI=100 for both, the formula would adjust for the inflation that happened between then and 2019.

So, the real exchange rate (RER) can be calculated as:

RER = Nominal Exchange Rate × (CPI_US / CPI_ID)

Wait, let me plug in the numbers. 

RER = 14,000 × (110 / 105)

Wait, 110/105 is approximately 1.047619. So multiplying that by 14,000 gives:

14,000 × 1.047619 ≈ 14,666.67.

Looking at the options, option F is 14,666.67. So is that the correct answer?

Wait, but I should make sure I applied the correct formula. Another way to think about it: the real exchange rate is the nominal rate adjusted for inflation. So, if inflation in the US was higher, the USD should depreciate in real terms. Wait, because higher inflation in the US would mean that each USD can buy fewer goods, so in real terms, you need more USD to buy the same as before, but since we're quoting IDR per USD, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternative approach: The real exchange rate can also be thought of as:

RER = (Nominal Exchange Rate × Domestic CPI) / Foreign CPI

Wait, wait. Let's think: the nominal exchange rate is E = IDR/USD. Domestic CPI is Indonesia's, foreign is US.

So RER = E × (CPI_ID / CPI_US)

Wait, that would make sense because if domestic prices (Indonesia) go up more than foreign, the real exchange rate increases (more IDR per USD in real terms). Let's compute that.

E = 14,000
CPI_ID = 105
CPI_US = 110

So RER = 14,000 × (105 / 110) = 14,000 × 0.954545 ≈ 13,363.64.

Wait, but that gives a different answer, around 13,363.64, which isn't one of the options. Hmm, that's confusing. Let me double-check.

Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. I think the correct formula is RER = (Nominal Exchange Rate × Foreign CPI) / Domestic CPI.

Because, the idea is that the real exchange rate adjusts for the price changes in both countries. So, if the foreign country (US) has higher inflation, their goods are more expensive, so in real terms, you need more of your currency to buy the same amount of foreign goods.

So, using that formula:

RER = (E × CPI_US) / CPI_ID

Plugging in the numbers:

E = 14,000
CPI_US = 110
CPI_ID = 105

RER = (14,000 × 110) / 105 = (1,540,000) / 105 ≈ 14,666.67.

Which brings us back to option F, 14,666.67.

Wait, but earlier when I thought about it another way, I got a different result. So which formula is correct?

I think the confusion arises from how the real exchange rate is defined. It depends on perspective. The real exchange rate can be expressed as units of domestic currency per unit of foreign currency, adjusted for inflation.

The formula I think is correct is:

RER = Nominal Exchange Rate × (Foreign Price Level / Domestic Price Level)

Since the price levels are measured by CPI, which is the consumer price index.

So, RER = E × (CPI_US / CPI_ID)

Wait, but in this case, that would be 14,000 × (110/105) ≈14,666.67, which is option F.

Wait, but another source I recall says that the real exchange rate is calculated as:

RER = (Nominal Exchange Rate × Domestic CPI) / Foreign CPI

Wait, that would give 14,000 × (105/110) ≈13,636.36, which is close to option G (13,888.89) but not exact.

Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up the formula. Let me think of it this way: The real exchange rate measures the number of units of real domestic goods that can be obtained for one unit of foreign goods. So, if inflation is higher in the foreign country, each unit of foreign currency (USD) buys less foreign goods, so the real exchange rate (in terms of IDR per USD) would increase.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is RER = (Nominal Exchange Rate) × (Domestic CPI / Foreign CPI). Let me try that.

So, RER = 14,000 × (105 / 110) = 14,000 × 0.954545 ≈ 13,363.64, which doesn't match any option exactly. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think about it differently. The real exchange rate can be calculated as:

RER = Nominal Exchange Rate × (CPI_base_year_foreign / CPI_current_year_foreign) × (CPI_current_year_domestic / CPI_base_year_domestic)

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right.

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is:

RER = (Nominal Exchange Rate × CPI_domestic) / CPI_foreign

Because, suppose both countries have the same inflation, then RER remains the same as the nominal. If domestic inflation is higher, RER increases (more IDR per USD in real terms), which makes sense because domestically, things are more expensive.

Wait, in our case, Indonesia's inflation is 5%, US is 10%. So higher in US. So the RER should increase, meaning more IDR per USD, right?

Because if the US has higher inflation, the same USD can buy fewer goods, so in real terms, each USD is weaker. So in real terms, the exchange rate should be higher than nominal.

Wait, the nominal exchange rate in 2019 is 14,000, which is stronger (fewer IDR per USD) than 2010's 15,000. But the real exchange rate might actually be higher or lower depending on inflation.

Wait, let me try to compute using the formula RER = Nominal × (Domestic CPI / Foreign CPI).

So, RER = 14,000 × (105 / 110) ≈ 14,000 × 0.9545 ≈ 13,363.64.

Hmm, that's lower than the nominal rate, which was 14,000. But since the US had higher inflation, shouldn't the real exchange rate be higher? Because the USD is weaker in real terms.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is RER = Nominal × (Foreign CPI / Domestic CPI). Because if foreign prices go up more, the real exchange rate increases.

So in that case, RER = 14,000 × (110/105) ≈ 14,666.67.

Which is option F. So that's matching what I got earlier.

But I'm getting a bit stuck on which formula is correct. Let me try to find another way to think about it.

The real exchange rate is often defined as:

RER = (Nominal Exchange Rate × Price Level of Foreign) / Price Level of Domestic

Where Price Level is CPI.

So in this case, RER = (14,000 × 110) / 105.

Calculating that: 14,000 * 110 = 1,540,000; divided by 105 gives approximately 14,666.67.

So that's option F.

Alternatively, sometimes the real exchange rate is expressed as foreign goods per domestic goods. So it's (E × P*) / P, where P* is foreign price level, P is domestic. So that would give the same result.

I think I'm confident now that the correct approach is to multiply the nominal exchange rate by the ratio of the foreign CPI to the domestic CPI. So the real exchange rate is 14,666.67, which is option F.
</think>

To calculate the real exchange rate (RER), we use the formula:

\[
\text{RER} = \text{Nominal Exchange Rate} \times \left(\frac{\text{Foreign CPI}}{\text{Domestic CPI}}\right)
\]

### Given Data:
- **Nominal Exchange Rate (2019)**: IDR 14,000/USD
- **Indonesia's CPI (2019)**: 105
- **US CPI (2019)**: 110

### Calculation:
Substitute the values into the formula:

\[
\text{RER} = 14,000 \times \left(\frac{110}{105}\right)
\]

First, calculate the ratio:

\[
\frac{110}{105} \approx 1.047619
\]

Then multiply by the nominal exchange rate:

\[
\text{RER} = 14,000 \times 1.047619 \approx 14,666.67
\]

### Conclusion:
The real exchange rate is approximately **14,666.67**, which corresponds to **Option F**.
