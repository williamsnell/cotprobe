Question:

A husband and his passenger were killed in an auto collision involving a defendant. The husband's wife now brings an action to recover damages for loss of society and companionship. The wife testified that she and her husband had a close relationship and that they were happily married for over 15 years. Then on cross-examination, defendant's counsel asked her if she "was aware of the affair that her husband was having with his passenger?"The wife's attorney immediately objected to this question. The judge should rule that the question is

Options:

A: objectionable, because it is irrelevant to the case at hand.
B: unobjectionable, because it could potentially influence the jury's perception of the wife's claim.
C: objectionable, because it could be seen as an attempt to tarnish the reputation of the deceased.
D: objectionable, because it was highly prejudicial.
E: unobjectionable, because it was relevant on the issue of negligence.
F: unobjectionable, because plaintiff's knowledge of such an affair was probative of the value to be placed on her loss.
G: objectionable, because the question is beyond the scope of direct examination.
H: objectionable, because it infringes on the privacy of the deceased.
I: unobjectionable, because it provides a potential motive for the accident.

Alright, so I've got this multiple-choice question about evidence law, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let's break it down step by step.

The scenario is that a husband and his passenger were killed in a car accident. The wife is suing to recover damages for loss of society and companionship. She testified that they had a close, happy marriage of over 15 years. On cross-examination, the defense attorney asks if she knew about her husband's affair with the passenger. Her attorney objects, and the question is whether the judge should allow it.

The options are A through I, each giving a different reason for why the question is objectionable or unobjectionable.

First, I need to recall the rules of evidence, particularly regarding relevancy, character evidence, and what's allowed on cross-examination.

So, the wife is claiming loss of companionship and society. The defense brings up an affair. My initial thought is that the affair might be irrelevant because it doesn't directly relate to the cause of the accident or the wife's claim. Unless it's relevant to some issue in the case, it might be inadmissible.

But wait, could it be relevant to the damages? Damages here are about the loss of companionship. If the affair shows that the marriage wasn't as happy as the wife claims, maybe it affects the damages. So, if the affair is true, and the wife knew about it, that could impact how much the jury values her loss because maybe their relationship wasn't as strong.

However, evidence about a person's character is generally not admissible unless it's directly relevant. For a victim in a wrongful death case, their character is usually protected. Unless the plaintiff's own credibility is at issue, introducing such evidence might be problematic.

In this case, the wife testified about their close relationship. The defense might argue that the affair contradicts that, so it's relevant to her credibility. But I'm not sure if that's the right approach. The affair would go to the weight of the marriage, which relates to the damages she's claiming.

Wait, but there's another angle. The passenger was in the car with the husband. If the affair was with the passenger, maybe it's relevant to the circumstances of the accident. Like, maybe the affair led to some action that caused the accident, but that's speculative. The question is about the wife's knowledge, not about the accident's cause.

So, the question is on cross-examination. The scope of cross is generally limited to the matters raised on direct. The wife testified about their relationship, so the defense can ask about that. But does that include asking about an affair?

Another point is that the affair could be considered character evidence about the deceased, which is usually inadmissible unless it's directly relevant. Since the plaintiff is claiming loss of companionship, perhaps the quality of the relationship is relevant. If the husband was having an affair, it might indicate that the marriage wasn't as strong as the wife claims, thus affecting the damages.

But wait, I remember that in some cases, evidence of a spouse's infidelity is inadmissible because it's more prejudicial than probative. The probative value here is whether the affair affects the damages, but the risk of unfair prejudice might outweigh that.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the question is objectionable because irrelevant. If the affair isn't relevant to the case, then it's objectionable. But if it's relevant to the damages, then A might not be correct.

Option B says it's unobjectionable because it could influence the jury's perception of the wife's claim. That sounds plausible because it goes to the heart of her damages.

Option C says it's objectionable as an attempt to tarnish the deceased's reputation. That's a possible reason, but the issue is more about relevance and prejudice.

Option D says it's objectionable because highly prejudicial. That could be, but the court might find it relevant enough.

Option E suggests it's relevant to negligence. I don't see how the affair would relate to the accident's cause, so E is probably wrong.

Option F says it's unobjectionable because the plaintiff's knowledge affects the loss's value. If the wife knew, maybe the loss isn't as significant, but if she didn't, maybe it's more. But does the affair itself affect the value? Or is it the knowledge?

Option G is about scope of direct. The wife talked about their marriage, so cross can cover that. G doesn't seem right.

Option H is about privacy of the deceased. There's a privacy interest, but in court cases, sometimes that's outweighed by relevance.

Option I suggests it provides a motive for the accident. That seems like a stretch. The affair might not directly cause the accident unless, say, the passenger was distracting the driver, but that's not indicated here.

So, the key issue is whether the affair is relevant to the damages. If the wife's claim is based on the strength of their relationship, then evidence that their relationship was troubled (like an affair) could be relevant. However, such evidence might also be considered highly prejudicial because it attacks the deceased's character.

But wait, in a wrongful death case, the plaintiff's damages are based on their loss. If the marriage was troubled, perhaps the loss isn't as great. So, evidence of the affair could be relevant to the damages.

But is the question about the wife's knowledge of the affair? Or is it about the affair itself? The question is whether she was aware. So, if she wasn't aware, maybe the affair still existed, but her knowledge isn't directly about the relationship's quality. Hmm, but if she was aware, it could mean the marriage was troubled, impacting her loss.

Alternatively, the existence of the affair, regardless of her knowledge, could be relevant. But the question is phrased as whether she knew, which makes me think it's about her credibility. If she claims they were happily married, but she knew about the affair, that could impeach her credibility.

Wait, but the affair's existence might be irrelevant if the wife didn't know. Or, if she did know, it affects the damages. It's a bit tricky.

Another angle: In some jurisdictions, evidence of specific instances of conduct can't be used to prove character but can be used for other purposes, like to show motive or to rebut a claim of a happy marriage.

So, the question is whether the affair is admissible to challenge the wife's testimony about their close relationship. If so, then it's relevant and admissible.

But I've also read that courts are cautious about admitting evidence of a deceased person's affairs because it's prejudicial and the deceased can't defend themselves. So, even if relevant, it might be excluded as more prejudicial than probative under Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence.

Putting it all together, the question is whether the judge should allow the defense to ask about the affair. The options suggest that some think it's objectionable because it's irrelevant or prejudicial, while others think it's relevant to the damages.

Option F says it's unobjectionable because plaintiff's knowledge is probative of the loss's value. That makes sense because if she knew, the loss might be less. So, F could be a possible answer.

But wait, if the affair is a fact, whether she knew or not, the existence of the affair could affect the damages. But the question is about her knowledge, which might go more to her credibility.

Alternatively, the knowledge isn't directly about the affair's impact on the marriage but about her credibility. So, if she denied knowing, it could impeach her, but if she didn't know, maybe it doesn't affect the damages.

I'm a bit torn. On one hand, the affair might be relevant to the damages. On the other, it's potentially prejudicial.

Looking at the options again, option F seems to suggest that the knowledge is probative of the loss's value. So, if the wife knew about the affair, perhaps the jury would think her loss is less because the marriage was troubled. So, it's relevant to the damages she's claiming.

Alternatively, option A says it's irrelevant. But if it's about the quality of the marriage, which she testified about, it's relevant.

So, I'm leaning towards F being correct. But another thought: the affair is about the deceased's character, and usually, in civil cases, a person's character is not admissible unless it's directly at issue. Here, the issue is the value of the wife's loss, so perhaps the character evidence is admissible for that purpose.

Wait, but the question is about the wife's knowledge. So, if she knew, it affects her loss. If she didn't, maybe the affair still existed, but she didn't know, so her loss is genuine. So, the knowledge is probative.

In that case, option F would be correct because it's about the value of her loss.

But another angle: introducing evidence of the affair could be so prejudicial that it outweighs its probative value. So even if relevant, it's excluded under Rule 403.

But the question is whether the judge should rule it objectionable. If the question is relevant, the objection would be overruled unless it's too prejudicial.

I'm not sure. Some courts might allow it, others might not.

Looking at the answer options:

Option A: Objectionable as irrelevant. If the affair is relevant to the damages, A is wrong.

Option B: Unobjectionable, could influence jury's perception. That's possible, but it's a bit vague.

Option C: Objectionable as attempt to tarnish deceased's reputation. That's a possibility, but the reason might be more about relevance.

Option D: Objectionable as highly prejudicial. Maybe, but only if the prejudice outweighs the probative value.

Option F: Unobjectionable because plaintiff's knowledge is probative of the loss's value. This seems correct because if she knew, it might reduce the damages.

Alternatively, the question is about whether she knew, not about the affair itself. So, if she didn't know, the affair still existed, but her knowledge might not change the fact. Hmm, perhaps not.

Wait, maybe the affair is irrelevant because the measure of damages is the loss to the plaintiff, not the deceased's actions. Unless the affair directly affects the plaintiff's loss, it's irrelevant. But the plaintiff testified about their close relationship, so the defense can challenge that.

So, the affair is relevant to contradict the plaintiff's testimony about the quality of the marriage, which affects the damages. Therefore, the question is relevant, and the objection should be overruled.

So, the answer would be F: unobjectionable because plaintiff's knowledge is probative of the value of her loss.

But wait, another thought: the knowledge of the affair might not directly relate to the value of the loss. The existence of the affair, regardless of her knowledge, would be more relevant. So, maybe the question should be about whether the affair occurred, not whether she knew.

But the question is phrased as whether she was aware. So, perhaps it's about her credibility. If she claims a happy marriage but knew about the affair, that would impeach her testimony.

Alternatively, if she didn't know, maybe the affair wasn't affecting their relationship, so it's not relevant.

This is getting a bit complicated. I'm thinking that the correct answer is F because the knowledge is probative of the value of the loss. So, the question is unobjectionable.

But I'm not entirely confident. Another possibility is that the affair is irrelevant because it doesn't relate to the cause of the accident or the wife's claim beyond trying to besmirch the husband's character, which is inadmissible. So option A could be correct.

Wait, but the wife's claim is about loss of companionship, so the quality of the marriage is directly relevant. Therefore, evidence that contradicts her testimony about the marriage's quality is relevant and admissible.

So, the question should be allowed. Therefore, the correct answer is F.
</think>

The question revolves around whether the defense's inquiry into the wife's knowledge of her husband's alleged affair is admissible in a case where the wife is seeking damages for loss of society and companionship. The analysis hinges on the rules of evidence, particularly relevance, prejudice, and the scope of cross-examination.

The wife testified about the close and happy nature of her marriage, which is directly relevant to her claim for damages. The defense's question about the affair challenges the quality of the marriage, potentially undermining the wife's testimony and the value of her loss. This makes the question relevant to the case, as it could impact the jury's perception of the damages.

However, introducing evidence of the deceased's affair raises concerns about prejudice and the deceased's reputation. Courts are often cautious about admitting such evidence unless it is directly probative of an issue in the case. Here, the question is framed to ask about the wife's knowledge of the affair, which could impeach her credibility if she claims the marriage was happy despite knowing about the affair. This makes the question relevant to the damages calculation, as the wife's knowledge could influence the perceived value of her loss.

Option F is the most appropriate answer because it aligns with the idea that the wife's knowledge of the affair is probative of the value of her loss. While other options raise valid concerns about relevance, prejudice, or the deceased's reputation, the question is ultimately admissible because it challenges the wife's testimony about the marriage's quality, which is central to her claim.

Answer: F
