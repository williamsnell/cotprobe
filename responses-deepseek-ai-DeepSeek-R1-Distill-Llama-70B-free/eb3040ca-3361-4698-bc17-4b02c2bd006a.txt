Question:

A woman joined a web site to get her credit reports. The site required creation of an account before she could enter. On that form, a notice appeared in bold letters: "TERMS AND CONDITIONS: This is a Contract. By creating an account, you agree to and accept the terms and conditions for use of this website." She did not access the terms, which she could have done by clicking a conspicuous link. She started an account and paid $50 for a credit report. For the next 6 months, her credit card was automatically billed $50, without notice, except that she received email notice that the report was available at the site. The terms and conditions provided that she authorized the charges, unless she notified the company otherwise in advance. Which party will likely prevail on the issue of whether she was bound to pay for the 6 months until she canceled?

Options:

A: The company will prevail because the provision notifying her of the contract is in bold and the contract is easily accessible.
B: The woman will prevail because terms and conditions have been ruled to be contracts of adhesion that are largely unenforceable.
C: The woman will prevail because the terms and conditions, or important parts, must be described on the 'create an account' page, which was not done here.
D: The company will prevail because the woman failed to cancel her subscription and thus implicitly agreed to the terms.
E: The woman will prevail because she did not explicitly agree to the recurring charges.
F: The woman will prevail because she was not given explicit notice of the recurring charges.
G: The company will prevail because the woman did not cancel her subscription and thus accepted the terms.
H: The woman will prevail because the terms were not explicitly stated before she made the initial payment.

Okay, so I need to figure out this legal question about contract terms and whether the woman is bound to pay for six months. Let me break it down step by step.

The scenario is that a woman signed up for a website to get her credit reports. To create an account, she had to agree to the terms and conditions, which were in bold and had a link she could click. She didn't read them but proceeded to create the account and paid $50. Then, for the next six months, she was automatically billed $50 each month without any additional notice, except emails that her report was available. The terms she agreed to allowed these charges unless she canceled in advance.

The question is whether she's bound to pay for those six months until she canceled.

Hmm, I remember that contract law generally requires mutual assent, meaning both parties agree to the terms. In cases where terms are presented in a way that's not immediately visible, like in a link, it's often called a "browsewrap" agreement. But if the terms are in a place that's conspicuous, courts might enforce them.

So here, the terms were in bold on the account creation page, and there was a link. She didn't click the link, but the notice was conspicuous. I think this makes it a clickwrap agreement because she had to take an affirmative action (like checking a box) to agree, even though she didn't read them. Wait, no, the question doesn't mention a checkbox, just that she created the account after seeing the bold terms. So maybe it's a browsewrap, but the terms were prominently displayed.

In cases like this, courts have sometimes found that if the terms are sufficiently conspicuous, the user is bound, even if they didn't read them. For example, in the case of Nguyen v. Barnes & Noble, the court held that browsewrap agreements require the terms to be conspicuous and that the user has a reasonable opportunity to view them.

In this problem, the terms were in bold and had a link. She could have clicked to read but didn't. So the company might argue that she had constructive knowledge of the terms because they were made available to her in a conspicuous manner.

Looking at the options:

A: The company will prevail because the provision was in bold and easily accessible. That sounds plausible because the terms were conspicuous.

B: She'll win because terms are contracts of adhesion. But that's more about take-it-or-leave-it contracts. Even if so, if the terms are properly presented, they can be enforceable.

C: She'll win because terms must be on the create account page. But here, the terms were accessible via a link, but the main point is whether they were sufficiently presented. Courts don't require all terms to be on the same page as long as they're accessible and conspicuous.

D: Company because she didn't cancel. That's about the terms themselves, not whether she agreed to them in the first place.

E: She didn't explicitly agree to recurring charges. But the terms were part of the agreement she accepted when creating the account, so it's about whether the terms are enforceable.

F: She wins because no explicit notice of recurring charges. But the terms, which she agreed to, included that. So notice might not be required if the terms were properly presented.

G: Company because she didn't cancel. Again, more about the terms after agreement, not formation.

H: She wins because terms weren't stated before payment. But the terms were presented at the time of account creation, which was before the first payment.

So the key issue is whether she was bound by the terms because she had the opportunity to read them, even though she didn't. If the presentation was sufficient, then she's bound. The fact that the terms were in bold and the link was there likely makes it enforceable, so the company would prevail.

Looking at the options, A seems to fit because it's about the terms being in bold and accessible. So the company can enforce the recurring charges as per the terms she agreed to when creating the account.

The woman is likely bound by the terms and conditions because they were presented in a conspicuous mannerâ€”highlighted in bold with a link for easy access. Courts generally enforce such terms when they are sufficiently prominent, even if the user does not read them. This aligns with the principle that constructive knowledge of the terms can be inferred when they are readily available. Therefore, the company will prevail.
