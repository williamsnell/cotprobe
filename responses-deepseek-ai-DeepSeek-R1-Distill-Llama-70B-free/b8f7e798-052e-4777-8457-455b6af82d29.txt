Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A man entered into a franchise contract with a company to operate a fast-food restaurant in a city. The company's national headquarters is located in another state. After the contract was executed, the man leased a store in a shopping center where he planned to open his restaurant. City public officials, however, refused to grant the man the necessary food vendor's license despite the fact that he could prove that his restaurant complied with all provisions of the municipal licensing ordinance. Section 1287 of the city food vending ordinance provides, in part, that "a food vendor's license shall be issued to any applicant who properly complies with all of the health requirements of this ordinance. " After the man's application for a food vendor's license was rejected, he requested a hearing to establish his qualifications. City officials refused this request and also declined to give any reason for his license denial. Which of the following is the strongest constitutional argument that the man may use to challenge the refusal of the city officials to grant him a food vendor's license?

Options:

A: The city action infringes on his right to property without just compensation.
B: The city action is a violation of his First Amendment rights.
C: The city action is a breach of his Fourth Amendment rights.
D: The city action denies him the right to work under the Thirteenth Amendment.
E: The city action violates his right to fair trial.
F: The city action constitutes an undue burden on the potential interstate commerce between the man and his out-of-state franchisor.
G: The city action denies him procedural due process.
H: The city action is an infringement on his right to equal protection under the law.
I: The city action impairs the obligation of the man's contract with the franchising company and his rental agreement with the shopping mall.
J: The city action denies him substantive due process by arbitrarily regulating economic activity.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about constitutional law, and I need to figure out the strongest argument the man can make against the city's refusal to grant him a food vendor's license. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let me read the scenario carefully. The man entered into a franchise contract with a company based in another state. He leased a store and applied for a food vendor's license, but the city officials refused him even though he complied with all the ordinance provisions. The ordinance, section 1287, says that a license shall be issued to any applicant who meets all the health requirements. So, the city is supposed to issue the license if he meets the criteria, but they didn't, and they also refused a hearing and didn't give any reason.

Now, the question is asking which constitutional argument is the strongest. The options are A through J, each pointing to a different constitutional issue.

I need to think about each option and see which one applies best here.

Option A: Right to property without just compensation. That's about the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment. If the government takes your property for public use without paying, that's a problem. But here, he's being denied a license, which is more of a Due Process issue, not a taking. So maybe not A.

Option B: First Amendment rights. The First Amendment covers free speech, religion, etc. I don't see a direct link here. He's not being silenced or restricted in speech, so B might not be it.

Option C: Fourth Amendment. That's about unreasonable searches and seizures. Again, not directly applicable here. The issue is about a license denial, not a search or seizure.

Option D: Thirteenth Amendment. That's about slavery and involuntary servitude. The right to work isn't directly under the 13th Amendment. It's more about freedom from compelled labor, so D doesn't fit.

Option E: Right to a fair trial. That's more about criminal proceedings. He's not being tried; he's being denied a license. So E might not apply unless it's about procedural due process.

Option F: Interstate commerce. The city's action could affect interstate commerce if the franchisor is out of state. The commerce clause might be at play, but I'm not sure if that's the strongest argument here. It could be a possible angle, but I'm not certain yet.

Option G: Procedural due process. This is about the process before denying life, liberty, or property. The city refused a hearing and didn't give reasons. If he has a right to the license upon complying, then the city can't deny it without due process. So G seems relevant.

Option H: Equal protection. This would require that he's being treated differently from others without a rational basis. But the facts don't mention others being treated differently, so maybe not H unless he can show discrimination.

Option I: Contract clause. The Contracts Clause in Article I, Section 10, prohibits states from impairing contracts. But the city isn't a party to his franchise or lease contracts, so their action might not be directly impairing the contracts. I'm not sure if that's a strong argument here.

Option J: Substantive due process. This is about the arbitrary exercise of power without a rational basis. If the city is denying the license arbitrarily despite compliance, it might violate substantive due process. But courts are usually wary of substantive due process claims unless there's a fundamental right at stake.

Now, considering all options, G and J are the top contenders. Procedural due process (G) would involve the right to a hearing and a reason for denial. Since the ordinance says the license "shall" be issued upon compliance, the man might have a legitimate claim of entitlement. If the city is denying without any reason and without a hearing, they're violating procedural due process.

Substantive due process (J) would argue that the denial is arbitrary and without rational basis, but without more facts on why they denied it, procedural might be stronger here.

Wait, the man did request a hearing, and the city refused. So the issue is both the refusal to give a reason and the refusal to provide a hearing. That points to a procedural due process violation because he wasn't given the opportunity to be heard or to know why he was denied.

So the strongest argument would be G: Procedural due process. The city's action denied him the license without a hearing, which is a procedural issue.

Another angle: The ordinance says the license "shall" be issued if he complies. So the city doesn't have discretion; it's a ministerial act. If that's the case, the man has a right to the license, and the city's denial without reason or hearing would be a procedural due process violation.

Yes, I think G is the right answer.

The strongest constitutional argument the man can make is that the city's refusal to grant him a food vendor's license and its denial of a hearing violate his right to procedural due process. The city ordinance explicitly states that a license "shall" be issued to any applicant who complies with all health requirements, indicating that the issuance is not discretionary but rather a ministerial act. By refusing the license without providing a reason or a hearing, the city deprived the man of his entitlement to the license and the opportunity to challenge the denial, thereby violating procedural due process under the Due Process Clause of the Constitution.

Answer: G
