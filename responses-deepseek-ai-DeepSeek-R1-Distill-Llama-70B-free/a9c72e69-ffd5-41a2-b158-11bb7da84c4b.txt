Okay, so I have this physics problem here about an automobile accelerating from rest. Hmm, let me try to work through this step by step. 

The problem says the automobile has a mass of 50 slugs. Oh wait, slugs are the unit of mass in the imperial system, right? So 50 slugs is the m. The question is about finding the velocity after 10 seconds and the distance covered in that time. 

The force acting on it is given by F = F0 - kt. F0 is 200 lb, k is 10 lb/s, and t is time in seconds. So the force is a linear function of time that decreases as time increases. Interesting. 

I remember from Newton's second law that F = ma. Since F is given as a function of time, I can probably set that equal to ma and integrate to find velocity and position. 

First, let me note down the given values:
- Mass (m) = 50 slugs
- F0 = 200 lb
- k = 10 lb/s
- Time (t) = 10 sec

So F(t) = 200 - 10t lb.

Since F = ma, then a(t) = F(t)/m. So a(t) = (200 -10t)/50. Let me compute that. 200/50 is 4, and 10t divided by 50 is 0.2t. So a(t) = 4 - 0.2t ft/s². Wait, because acceleration is in ft/s², right? Because F in lb, m in slugs, so a is ft/s².

Now, velocity is the integral of acceleration with respect to time. The initial velocity is zero because it starts from rest. So I can integrate a(t) from 0 to 10 seconds.

v(t) = ∫ a(t) dt = ∫ (4 - 0.2t) dt from 0 to 10.

Integrating term by term:
Integral of 4 dt is 4t.
Integral of 0.2t dt is 0.2*(t²/2) = 0.1 t².

So v(t) = [4t - 0.1 t²] evaluated from 0 to 10.

At t=10: 4*10 =40. 0.1*(10)^2 = 0.1*100=10. So 40-10=30 ft/s. Wait, that's the velocity at 10 seconds. But wait, let me think again. Wait, 0.2t is subtracted, so integrating gives 4t minus 0.1t². So yeah, at t=10, 40 minus 10 is 30. But wait, that seems low. Let me check my integration again.

Wait, ∫ (4 - 0.2t) dt from 0 to 10. The antiderivative is 4t - (0.2/2) t², which is 4t - 0.1 t^2. Evaluated at 10, that's 4*10=40, 0.1*100=10. So 40-10=30. So velocity is 30 ft/s? But looking at the options, I don't see 30 as a velocity. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, wait a minute. Did I mix up something else? Oh wait, perhaps I messed up the units, or perhaps I should compute the integral correctly. Alternatively, maybe I should express F in terms that make sense.

Wait, another approach: since F = m a, then a(t) = (F0 - kt)/m. So with F0=200, k=10, m=50.

So a(t) is (200 -10t)/50. 200/50=4, and 10t/50=0.2t. So a(t)=4 -0.2t ft/s². So that part seems correct.

Then integrating a(t) from 0 to 10 gives v(10)=∫0^10 (4-0.2t) dt.

So yeah, 4t - 0.1 t² evaluated from 0 to 10. At 10: 4*10=40, 0.1*(10^2)=10. So 40-10=30 ft/s. So velocity is 30 ft/s.

Wait, but none of the options have 30 ft/s as the velocity. Hmmm. That suggests I made a mistake somewhere. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I should compute the impulse, which is the integral of F(t) over time. Because impulse equals change in momentum, and since the car starts from rest, the impulse would be m*v.

Wait, let's compute the impulse. Impulse J is ∫ F(t) dt from 0 to 10.

F(t)=200-10t. So J = ∫0^10 (200 -10t) dt.

Compute that: integral of 200 is 200t, integral of 10t is 5t². So J = [200*10 -5*(10)^2] - [0 -0] = 2000 -500 = 1500 lb·s.

Impulse J equals m*v, because initial momentum is zero. So m*v= J → v= J/m. So J is 1500 lb·s, m=50 slugs. So v=1500/50=30 ft/s. So same result as before.

But the options don't have 30 ft/s. So perhaps I did something wrong in the setup.

Wait, maybe I should compute displacement as the integral of velocity. So let me try that.

v(t) = ∫ a(t) dt + initial velocity. Initial velocity is zero.

We found v(t) =4t -0.1 t². So to find displacement, s = ∫0^10 v(t) dt = ∫0^10 (4t -0.1 t²) dt.

Compute that integral. Integral of 4t is 2t². Integral of 0.1 t² is (0.1/3) t^3 = (1/30) t^3.

So s = [2t² - (1/30) t^3] from 0 to 10.

At t=10: 2*(100) =200. (1/30)*1000=1000/30≈33.333.

So s=200 - 33.333≈166.666... feet.

Wait, so displacement is approximately 166.666 feet, which is 500/3 or 166 2/3 ft. And velocity is 30 ft/s. So looking for an option that has velocity 30 (but none) and displacement 166 2/3. Wait, the options are for velocity and distance. Looking at the options:

Option J: 166 (2/3) f. Wait, maybe that's the displacement. But what about the velocity? Hmm, but earlier I thought the velocity was 30. So perhaps I made a mistake in the velocity calculation. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the velocity isn't 30. Let's see. If F(t)=200 -10t, then when t=10, F is 200-100=100 lb. So the force is positive but decreasing over time.

Wait, another idea: perhaps I should compute acceleration correctly. Let me check the units again. Force is in pounds, mass in slugs. Because in the imperial system, 1 slug = 1 lb·s²/ft. So a in ft/s² is F (lb) divided by mass (slug). So a = F/m → (lb)/(slug) = (lb·s²/ft) / (slug) → but wait, I'm getting confused with the units.

Wait, let me think: 1 slug is defined as 1 lb·s²/ft. So when you divide F (lb) by m (slug), you get (lb)/(lb·s²/ft) ) = ft/s². So that's correct. So a(t) is (200 -10t)/50 =4 -0.2t ft/s². Correct.

So integrating a(t) from 0 to 10 gives v(t)=4t -0.1 t². At t=10, v=4*10 -0.1*(100)=40-10=30 ft/s. So that part is correct.

So the velocity is 30 ft/s, but the options don't have that. Let me look again at the options. Wait, the options are A-J. Let me read them again.

Option A: 120 ft/s, 1000 ft

B: 200 f (maybe ft/s, but seems incomplete)

C: 130 ft/s, 900 ft

D: 180 f (similar to B)

E: 175, 1150

F:145, 1100

G: 150 f

H:190,950

I:160,1200

J: 166 (2/3) f (so maybe 166.666 ft/s? Or is the first number ft/s, second distance?)

Wait, the question asks for velocity and distance. So each option is velocity first, then distance. So option J is velocity 166 2/3 ft/s? But that's higher than what I got. Wait, but my calculation said 30 ft/s. That's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Oh wait, perhaps the force is applied only for as long as it's positive? So when does F(t) become zero?

F(t) =200 -10t. Setting F=0: 200 -10t=0 → t=20 seconds. So during the first 10 seconds, the force is always positive, so the acceleration is positive but decreasing. So integrating up to 10 seconds is correct.

So why am I getting a velocity of 30 ft/s but the options don't have that? Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the integration. Let me check again.

Wait, the acceleration function is a(t)=4-0.2t. Let me compute the definite integral from 0 to 10:

∫a dt from 0 to10 = [4t -0.1 t²] from 0 to10.

So at 10, 4*10=40, 0.1*10^2=10. So 40-10=30. So yes, velocity is 30 ft/s.

So the only option that has 30 ft/s would be if any option lists 30, but looking at the options, none have it. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the problem is that I forgot to include the units correctly. Let me double-check.

Wait, the mass is 50 slugs. F=ma, so a=F/m. So a=(200 -10t)/50. That's correct.

Hmm, maybe I should compute the velocity using the equations of motion. Since the acceleration is changing with time, perhaps I can't use the constant acceleration equations. Wait, but integrating gives the correct approach, which I did.

Alternatively, perhaps the initial setup is wrong. Wait, is the force equation correct? The problem says sumF equals F0 -kt. So yes, F(t) =200 -10t lb.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that I'm using the wrong value for g in the imperial system? Wait, no, because in this case, since we're using slugs and lb, the units are consistent without needing to multiply by g. So that shouldn't be an issue.

Wait, perhaps the question is asking for the distance in miles or something else, but no, the options are in ft.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of the displacement. Let me recompute that.

Displacement s is the integral of velocity from 0 to10. Velocity is v(t)=4t-0.1t².

So s=∫0^10 (4t -0.1 t²) dt.

Integrate term by term.

Integral of 4t is 2t².

Integral of 0.1 t² is (0.1/3) t^3 = (1/30) t^3.

So s = [2t² - (1/30)t³] from 0 to10.

At t=10: 2*(100) =200. (1/30)*1000=1000/30≈33.333.

So s=200 -33.333=166.666... feet, which is 500/3 ft, or about 166.666 ft.

Wait, so displacement is 500/3 ft, which is approximately 166.666 ft.

Looking back at the options, option J is 166 (2/3) f. So that's 166.666 ft. But what about the velocity?

Wait, the velocity I calculated is 30 ft/s, but none of the options have that. So something's wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the integration for velocity. Let me compute the integral again.

v(t)=∫0^10 a(t) dt = ∫0^10 (4−0.2t) dt.

4t from 0 to10 is 40. The integral of 0.2t is 0.1 t². Evaluated at 10, that's 10. So 40−10=30. So v=30 ft/s.

But the options don't have that. So perhaps I'm missing something. Did I read the question correctly? Oh wait, the problem says "the last 10 seconds," but perhaps it's a typo and it's "the first 10 seconds." No, the question says "during the first 10 sec," so that's correct.

Wait, another possibility: perhaps the force is F= F0 - kt until t=10, but if the force becomes zero before t=10, we have to adjust. But earlier, I calculated when F=0, t=20. So in the first 10 seconds, the force is positive. So no, that's not the issue.

Wait, maybe I should recompute the impulse. Impulse J is the area under F(t) from t=0 to10.

F(t) is 200 -10t. So the graph is a straight line starting at 200 lb and decreasing to 100 lb at t=10. So the area is a trapezoid with bases 200 and 100, height 10. So area = (200+100)/2 *10=1500 lb·s.

Impulse J=1500 lb·s. Since J=Δp= mΔv, and initial velocity is zero, so v= J/m=1500/50=30 ft/s. So same result.

Wait, but let me think about the displacement again. I found 166.666 ft. So option J's second part is 166 2/3 ft, which matches. But the first part, the velocity, is 30 ft/s, but no option lists that.

Wait, looking at the options again. Option J says 166 (2/3) f. Wait, maybe the first number is the velocity, but 166 is way higher than 30. That doesn't make sense. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem setup.

Wait, maybe the mass is 50 lb instead of 50 slugs. No, the problem says 50 slugs. Because if it was 50 lb, which is a force, not a mass.

Alternatively, maybe I should have converted the force into different units. Wait, no, because in the imperial system with slugs, F=ma works without conversion factors.

Wait, another idea: Maybe I should compute the average force and then compute velocity. The average force would be (F_initial + F_final)/2.

F_initial at t=0 is 200 lb, F_final at t=10 is 200 -100=100 lb.

Average F = (200+100)/2=150 lb.

Then average acceleration a_avg = F_avg/m=150/50=3 ft/s².

Velocity after 10s would be a_avg *t=3 *10=30 ft/s. Same result. So that's correct.

But again, the options don't have 30 ft/s. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.

Wait, the question asks for the velocity at the end of 10 seconds and the distance covered in that time. So I have v=30 ft/s, s=166.666 ft. So looking for an option where velocity is 30 and distance is 166.666 ft.

Looking at the options, I don't see any that combine those. So perhaps I did something wrong.

Wait, perhaps the question is in the wrong unit system. Let me double-check the given data. The options are in ft/s and ft, which is consistent with imperial units.

Wait, another thought: Did I make a mistake in the integral of acceleration? Let's see:

a(t) =4 -0.2t.

Integral from 0 to10: ∫4 dt=4t, ∫0.2t dt=0.1 t².

So v(t)=4t -0.1 t². At t=10, 4*10=40, 0.1*100=10. So 30 ft/s. Correct.

Wait, maybe the problem wants the average velocity, but no, average velocity would be total displacement over time: 166.666/10=16.666 ft/s, which doesn't help.

Hmm, perhaps I should look for the option where the displacement is 166 2/3, which is option J, but the velocity in option J isn't 30. So maybe I made a mistake in the displacement calculation.

Wait, let me compute the displacement again.

s=∫v dt from 0 to10. v(t)=4t -0.1 t².

So ∫v dt=2t² - (0.1/3) t³.

At t=10: 2*100=200, (0.1/3)*1000≈33.333.

So s=200 -33.333=166.666 ft. Correct.

So the displacement is 166 2/3 ft, which matches option J's second value. But the velocity is 30 ft/s, which isn't listed as an option. So this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I should check if there's any calculation mistake elsewhere. Let me recompute the integral of a(t).

Wait, a(t)=4 -0.2t. So the integral is 4t -0.1 t². At t=10, 40 -10=30. So velocity is 30 ft/s.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the acceleration becomes zero before 10 seconds, but no, as F(t)=0 at t=20, so up to 10, F is positive.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the distance using v^2 = u^2 + 2 a s, but that's for constant acceleration. Since
