Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A teenage male was on trial on charges of illegally entering an owner's property and stealing a car. The witness can only confirm for the prosecution that a car was stolen, the model and type of car, and that it was missing from the property on a certain date. The defense asks witness "isn't it possible that my client did not steal the car, that someone else did it, and that the police are lying about the charges against him? The prosecution objected to the question. Will the court likely sustain the objection?

Options:

A: No, as it is essential for the defense to create reasonable doubt in the minds of the jury.
B: Yes, because the question is not directly related to the charges against the defendant.
C: Yes, because this is an objectionable question based on pure speculation.
D: No, because the defense is merely suggesting a possibility, not stating it as fact.
E: No, because the defense has the right to question every aspect of the prosecution's case.
F: Yes, because it is not permissible to question the credibility of the police without substantial supporting evidence.
G: No, questioning about the possibility of other perpetrators, or about police misconduct, is always permissible.
H: No, because the witness may know something that he is not revealing and for that reason, a cross-examiner is given wide latitude in questioning.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question. Let me break it down step by step. 

The scenario is about a trial where a teenage male is charged with illegally entering someone's property and stealing a car. The witness for the prosecution can only confirm that a car was stolen, the model and type, and that it was missing on a certain date. So, the witness doesn't have direct evidence linking the defendant to the crime, just that the car was stolen.

Now, the defense is asking the witness a question: "Isn't it possible that my client did not steal the car, that someone else did it, and that the police are lying about the charges against him?" The prosecution objects to this question, and we need to determine if the court will sustain (uphold) that objection.

The options are from A to H. I need to think about the rules of evidence and trial procedure here. 

First, I remember that in cross-examination, the defense attorney can ask questions to challenge the prosecution's case. They can suggest alternative theories, like someone else committing the crime, to create reasonable doubt. So, asking if someone else could have done it seems permissible because it's trying to show that the defendant isn't necessarily guilty.

But the question also includes an accusation that the police are lying. That part might be problematic. I think there's a rule against making unfounded accusations, especially about police misconduct, without some basis. If the defense has no evidence that the police are lying, then that part of the question might be objectionable.

So the question combines two parts: suggesting another perpetrator and alleging police dishonesty. The first part is probably okay because it's a common defense strategy. The second part about police lying might not be, unless there's evidence to support it.

Wait, but the question is phrased as a possibility. It's not stating that the police are lying, just asking if it's possible. So maybe that's allowed as a speculative question to create doubt.

I recall that in cross-examination, attorneys are given some latitude. They can ask questions that suggest possibilities, even if they're speculative, as long as they're not completely unfounded. But if the question implies a fact not in evidence, like police lying without any basis, the court might sustain an objection.

So, the question here includes two possibilities: another thief and police lying. If the defense has no evidence of police misconduct, then bringing that up could be improper. The witness can't testify about police credibility unless there's a basis for it.

Therefore, the objection would likely be sustained because the question includes an unfounded accusation about the police lying. The first part about another person might be okay, but the second part could be seen as improper speculation without evidence.

Looking at the options:

A: No, essential for defense to create doubt. This might apply to the first part, but the second part is the issue.

B: Yes, not directly related. Well, it's related to the charges because it suggests another scenario.

C: Yes, objectionable as pure speculation. The police lying part is speculative without evidence.

D: No, suggesting possibility. If it's just a possibility, maybe allowed, but the police part is tricky.

E: No, right to question every aspect. But there are limits, especially on unfounded accusations.

F: Yes, can't question police credibility without evidence. This seems relevant.

G: No, always permissible. No, because some parts might not be permissible.

H: No, wide latitude. But again, the police part might be beyond that.

So, the likely correct answer is C or F. 

Option C says it's based on pure speculation. The question is speculative about the police lying since there's no evidence provided. Option F says it's not permissible to question police credibility without evidence, which also fits.

Between C and F, I think F is more precise because it's about questioning police credibility without evidence, making the question improper. So the court would sustain the objection because the defense is implying police misconduct without basis.

The question posed by the defense combines two elements: suggesting that someone else could have stolen the car and implying that the police are lying about the charges. While suggesting an alternative perpetrator is a permissible defense strategy to create reasonable doubt, the second part of the question—accusing the police of lying—raises concerns. 

Under the rules of evidence, attorneys are allowed wide latitude in cross-examination, but they cannot make unfounded accusations, especially about police misconduct, without some basis in evidence. Since there is no indication that the defense has evidence to support the claim that the police are lying, this part of the question could be deemed improper speculation. 

Option C states that the question is objectionable because it is based on pure speculation, which applies to the police lying part of the question. Option F emphasizes that questioning the credibility of the police without substantial evidence is impermissible. Between these, Option F is more precise because it directly addresses the issue of questioning police credibility without evidence, making the question improper.

Answer: F
