Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the period of revolution for two double stars that each have the same mass as the sun, and they're separated by 4 light years. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my orbital mechanics, but I think I can work through this.

Alright, I remember that when two objects orbit a common center of mass, their motion can be described using Kepler's laws or Newton's form of the gravitational force. Since both stars have the same mass as the sun, I can probably simplify the problem a bit.

Wait, Kepler's third law relates the orbital period to the size of the orbit and the masses involved. The formula I remember is P² = (4π²/G(M1 + M2)) * a³, where a is the semi-major axis. But wait, in this case, since the stars are orbiting their common center of mass, the distance each star is from the center is the same because their masses are equal. So the separation between them is 4 light years, which would be twice the semi-major axis for each star's orbit, right? Or wait, no, maybe not. Let me think again.

Wait, no. The separation is the distance between the two stars, so each star's orbit has a radius of half that, assuming equal mass. So the semi-major axis 'a' in the formula would be the total separation divided by 2. So a = 4 light years / 2 = 2 light years.

But wait, I'm getting confused here. When using Kepler's third law in the context of a two-body system, I think the formula actually uses the sum of the semi-major axes of both orbits. Oh wait, no, the formula uses the cube of the semi-major axis of their mutual orbit, which is the separation between them. Or maybe it's the sum of the individual semi-major axes. Hmm. I'm getting a bit stuck.

Let me try to clarify. The correct form of Kepler's third law when considering two bodies orbiting each other is P² = (4π² * a³) / (G(M1 + M2)), where 'a' is the semi-major axis of their orbit around each other. So in this case, 'a' is the separation between the two stars, which is 4 light years. Because each star's orbit is around the center of mass, and since their masses are equal, each orbits at a distance of 2 light years from the center. But the formula uses the sum, which in this case, since they're orbiting each other, 'a' is the total separation.

Wait no, I think I was mixing it up. Let me get this right. The formula for the orbital period of two bodies around their common center of mass is P² = (4π² * (d)³) / (G(M1 + M2)), where d is the separation between the two bodies. So yes, d is 4 light years.

So plugging in the numbers:

M1 and M2 are both the mass of the sun, so M1 + M2 = 2 * solar mass.

But wait, I need to make sure all my units are consistent. Using SI units would be a pain because the distances and masses are huge, so maybe it's better to use astronomical units and years. But I'm not sure if that's the easiest approach.

Alternatively, I remember there's a version of Kepler's third law where when you use AU, solar masses, and years, the formula simplifies. The standard form is P² = a³ / (M1 + M2), but I think that's when a is in AU, P in years, and masses in solar units. Wait, no, that's not exactly right. Let me think again.

Wait, the exact formula is P² = (4π² * a³) / (G(M1 + M2)). But when a is in meters, P in seconds, and masses in kg, it's a bit messy. Alternatively, using the version where a is in AU, P in years, and masses in solar masses, I think the formula becomes P² = a³ / (M1 + M2). Wait, no, that doesn't seem right because the formula would have different dimensions otherwise.

Wait, let me check the correct form. I think the correct version when using AU, years, and solar masses is P² = a³ / (M1 + M2). But wait, no—Kepler's third law in the case of objects orbiting the sun (where the sun's mass is much larger than the planet's mass) is P² = a³ when a is in AU and P in years. But in a binary system where both masses are significant, it's P² = a³ / (M1 + M2) when using those units. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps I should proceed with the formula.

Wait, another approach: Let's use SI units. Let's calculate everything in meters, kilograms, and seconds.

So, the separation d is 4 light years. Let's convert that to meters. A light year is the distance light travels in a year. The speed of light is approximately 3 x 10^8 m/s. The number of seconds in a year is about 3.15 x 10^7 s (since 365 days * 24 hours * 3600 seconds). So one light year is (3e8 m/s) * (3.15e7 s) ≈ 9.45e15 meters. So 4 light years is 4 * 9.45e15 = 3.78e16 meters.

The masses M1 and M2 are each the mass of the sun, which is about 1.9885 x 10^30 kg. So M1 + M2 = 2 * 1.9885e30 = 3.977e30 kg.

G is the gravitational constant, 6.6743e-11 m³ kg^-1 s^-2.

Now, applying the formula P² = (4π² * d³) / (G(M1 + M2)).

So plugging in the numbers:

d = 3.78e16 m.

Compute d³: (3.78e16)^3 = Let's compute that. 3.78^3 is approximately 3.78 * 3.78 = ~14.28, then *3.78 again: ~14.28 *3.78 ≈ 54. So in terms of exponents, (1e16)^3 is 1e48, so d³ ≈ 54e48 = 5.4e49 m³.

Now, compute numerator: 4 * π² * 5.4e49.

4 * (approx 9.87) = ~39.48.

39.48 * 5.4e49 = Let's compute 39.48 *5.4 first. 39 *5 is 195, 0.48*5=2.4, 39*0.4=15.6, 0.48*0.4=0.192. Wait, maybe better to compute 39.48 *5.4:

39.48 *5 = 197.4

39.48 *0.4 = 15.792

So total is 197.4 + 15.792 = 213.192.

So numerator is approximately 2.13192e51 m³.

Denominator: G(M1 + M2) = 6.6743e-11 * 3.977e30.

Multiply 6.6743e-11 by 3.977e30:

6.6743 *3.977 ≈ let's calculate that. 6 *4 is 24, but more accurately:

6.6743 *3.977:

6 * 3.977 = 23.862

0.6743 *3.977 ≈ approx 2.68.

So total approx 23.862 + 2.68 = 26.542.

So 26.542e( -11 +30 ) = 26.542e19 = 2.6542e20.

So denominator is 2.6542e20.

Now, P² = numerator / denominator = (2.13192e51) / (2.6542e20) = (2.13192 / 2.6542) * 1e(51-20) = approx 0.803 * 1e31 = 8.03e30.

So P² = 8.03e30 → P = sqrt(8.03e30) seconds.

Compute sqrt(8.03e30): sqrt(8.03) is approx 2.836, and sqrt(1e30) is 1e15. So P ≈ 2.836e15 seconds.

Now, convert seconds to years.

We know that 1 year is about 3.154e7 seconds, so P in years is 2.836e15 / 3.154e7 = approx (2.836 /3.154 )e(15-7) → approx 0.899e8 → 8.99e7 years, roughly 9e7 years.

Wait, but looking at the options, option E is 9e7, and option J is 8e7. Hmm, but my calculation gave approx 9e7, so perhaps option E.

But wait, I approximated a lot during calculations, so maybe I should check more accurately.

Let me recalculate some steps to be more precise.

First, let's recompute d in meters. 1 light year is 9.4607e15 meters, so 4 ly is 4 * 9.4607e15 = 3.7843e16 m.

d³ = (3.7843e16)^3 = (3.7843)^3 * (1e16)^3 = let me compute 3.7843^3.

3.7843 *3.7843: Let's compute that.

3 *3 =9, 3*.7843=2.3529, .7843*3=2.3529, .7843*.7843≈0.614.

So, 3.7843^2 ≈ (3 + 0.7843)^2 = 3^2 + 2*3*0.7843 + (0.7843)^2 = 9 + 4.702 + 0.614 ≈ 14.316.

So, 3.7843^3 = 3.7843 * 14.316 ≈ Let's compute that.

3 *14.316 = 42.948
0.7843 *14.316 ≈ approx 11.22.

So total ≈42.948 +11.22=54.168.

So d³ ≈54.168e48 =5.4168e49 m³.

Now, numerator:4π² *5.4168e49.

4π² ≈4*(9.8696)≈39.4784.

So 39.4784 *5.4168e49 = Let's compute 39.4784 *5.4168.

39 *5=195, 39*0.4168≈16.245, 0.4784*5≈2.392, 0.4784*0.4168≈0.1996.

Wait, perhaps better to compute 39.4784 *5.4168.

Let me do it step by step.

39.4784 *5 = 197.392

39.4784 *0.4 = 15.79136

39.4784 *0.0168 = approx 0.664.

So total≈197.392 +15.79136=213.18336 +0.664=213.84736.

So numerator≈213.84736e49 =2.13847e51 m³.

Denominator: G*(M1+M2)=6.6743e-11 *3.977e30.

Compute 6.6743 *3.977 = ?

6 *3.977=23.862

0.6743*3.977: Let's compute 0.6*3.977=2.386, 0.0743*3.977≈0.295. So total≈2.681. So total 23.862 +2.681=26.543.

So denominator=26.543e19 (since 6.6743e-11 *3.977e30= (6.6743*3.977) *1e( -11 +30 )=26.543e19=2.6543e20.

So P²=2.13847e51 /2.6543e20 = (2.13847/2.6543) *1e31.

2.13847 /2.6543 ≈ approx 0.805.

So P²=0.805e31 =8.05e30 → P= sqrt(8.05e30) seconds.

sqrt(8.05e30)=sqrt(8.05)*1e15. sqrt(8.05)=approx 2.839. So P≈2.839e15 seconds.

Convert seconds to years: 1 year≈3.154e7 seconds.

So P=2.839e15 /3.154e7 ≈ (2.839 /3.154) *1e8.

2.839 /3.154≈0.899 → 0.899e8=8.99e7 years ≈9e7 years.

Looking back at the options, option E is 9e7 years. So the answer should be E.

Wait, but earlier I thought maybe J (8e7), but the calculation here points to 9e7, which is option E.

To determine the period of revolution for two double stars of the same mass as the sun, separated by 4 light years, we use Kepler's third law in its generalized form for a two-body system:

\[
P^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 a^3}{G(M_1 + M_2)}
\]

Here:
- \(a\) is the separation between the two stars, which is 4 light years.
- \(M_1\) and \(M_2\) are the masses of the two stars, each equal to the mass of the sun (\(M_\odot = 1.9885 \times 10^{30} \, \mathrm{kg}\)).
- \(G\) is the gravitational constant (\(6.6743 \times 10^{-11} \, \mathrm{m^3 \, kg^{-1} \, s^{-2}}\)).

### Step 1: Convert the separation to meters
1 light year is approximately \(9.4607 \times 10^{15} \, \mathrm{m}\). Therefore, 4 light years is:

\[
a = 4 \times 9.4607 \times 10^{15} = 3.7843 \times 10^{16} \, \mathrm{m}.
\]

### Step 2: Compute \(a^3\)
\[
a^3 = (3.7843 \times 10^{16})^3 = 5.4168 \times 10^{49} \, \mathrm{m^3}.
\]

### Step 3: Compute the numerator \(4\pi^2 a^3\)
\[
4\pi^2 \approx 39.4784, \quad \text{so} \quad 4\pi^2 a^3 = 39.4784 \times 5.4168 \times 10^{49} = 2.13847 \times 10^{51} \, \mathrm{m^3}.
\]

### Step 4: Compute the denominator \(G(M_1 + M_2)\)
\[
M_1 + M_2 = 2 \times 1.9885 \times 10^{30} = 3.977 \times 10^{30} \, \mathrm{kg}.
\]
\[
G(M_1 + M_2) = 6.6743 \times 10^{-11} \times 3.977 \times 10^{30} = 2.6543 \times 10^{20} \, \mathrm{m^3 \, s^{-2}}.
\]

### Step 5: Compute \(P^2\)
\[
P^2 = \frac{2.13847 \times 10^{51}}{2.6543 \times 10^{20}} = 8.05 \times 10^{30} \, \mathrm{s^2}.
\]

### Step 6: Compute \(P\)
\[
P = \sqrt{8.05 \times 10^{30}} \approx 2.839 \times 10^{15} \, \mathrm{s}.
\]

### Step 7: Convert \(P\) to years
1 year is approximately \(3.154 \times 10^7 \, \mathrm{s}\), so:

\[
P = \frac{2.839 \times 10^{15}}{3.154 \times 10^7} \approx 8.99 \times 10^7 \, \mathrm{years}.
\]

### Final Answer
The period of revolution is approximately \(9 \times 10^7 \, \mathrm{years}\), which corresponds to **option E**.
