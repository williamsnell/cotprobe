Okay, so I have this question here about Dr. Donham's Senior View, and I'm supposed to figure out the correct answer. Let me try to remember what I learned in the chapter. The question is asking about factors important for a long life, and the options are A through I.

Dr. Donham mentioned mental stimulation, exercise, diet, and another factor. I remember that he talked about lifestyle factors contributing to longevity. So the four things he listed... I think the first three are mental stimulation, exercise, and diet. The question is about the fourth.

Wait, I think he might have emphasized the importance of social connections or relationships. Like, having a good social network. But looking at the options, I don't see "social connections" as an option. Let me check the options again.

The options are A: Avoiding stress, B: Owning a pet, C: Moderate amounts of alcohol, D: Living in warm climate, E: Good genes, F: Wealth, G: High caffeine, H: High protein, I: Regular travel.

Hmm. None of these directly say social connections, but maybe one of them relates. Owning a pet could be related because pets provide companionship, which is a form of social interaction. So maybe B is the answer?

Wait, another thought. I think Dr. Donham might have mentioned something about avoiding stress. Stress is a big factor in health, and managing it can contribute to longevity. So option A is avoiding stress. That could be the fourth factor.

Alternatively, maybe he talked about moderate alcohol consumption. I recall some studies suggesting that moderate drinking, like red wine, might have health benefits. So option C could be it.

Or perhaps good genes, E, because genetics play a role in longevity. But the question is about factors, which implies controllable lifestyle choices, not genetic factors. So E might not be the answer.

Owning a pet, B, is a possibility because pets can reduce stress and provide companionship, which supports mental health. But I'm not sure if that's what he specifically mentioned.

Wait, I also remember that in some studies, having a sense of purpose or being part of a community is important. But again, that's not one of the options.

Another angle: the question is from a Senior View, so maybe Dr. Donham was talking about things seniors can do. Mental stimulation, exercise, diet, and perhaps avoiding stress, which is a common issue as people age.

So between A, B, C. Let me think. If I recall correctly, the four points he made were mental stimulation, exercise, diet, and avoiding stress. So the answer would be A: Avoiding stress.

Alternatively, maybe it's moderate alcohol. I'm a bit confused because I'm trying to remember if he included that as a factor. Or perhaps it's social engagement, but that's not an option. So maybe the answer is A.

Wait, I think I remember the exact points. He listed mental stimulation, exercise, diet, and avoiding stress. So the fourth factor is avoiding stress. So the answer is A.

The question asks about the fourth factor Dr. Donham mentioned as important for a long life, in addition to mental stimulation, exercise, and diet. After considering the options, the most likely answer is avoiding stress, as it aligns with the emphasis on managing stress for longevity. 

Answer: A
