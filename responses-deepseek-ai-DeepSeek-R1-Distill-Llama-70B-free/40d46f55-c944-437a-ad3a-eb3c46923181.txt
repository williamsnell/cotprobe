The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Assume all gases are perfect unless stated otherwise. Note that 1 atm = 1.013 25 bar. Unless otherwise stated, thermochemical data are for 298.15 K. The constant-volume heat capacity of a gas can be measured by observing the decrease in temperature when it expands adiabatically and reversibly. If the decrease in pressure is also measured, we can use it to infer the value of $\gamma=C_p / C_V$ and hence, by combining the two values, deduce the constant-pressure heat capacity. A fluorocarbon gas was allowed to expand reversibly and adiabatically to twice its volume; as a result, the temperature fell from $298.15 \mathrm{~K}$ to $248.44 \mathrm{~K}$ and its pressure fell from $202.94 \mathrm{kPa}$ to $81.840 \mathrm{kPa}$. Evaluate $C_p$.

Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm trying to figure out how to solve it. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question is about a fluorocarbon gas expanding reversibly and adiabatically to twice its volume. As a result, the temperature drops from 298.15 K to 248.44 K, and the pressure drops from 202.94 kPa to 81.840 kPa. I need to evaluate the constant-pressure heat capacity, Cp, of the gas. The options are given as A to J, each with a different value.

Hmm, I remember that for an ideal gas undergoing a reversible adiabatic expansion, certain relations hold. The key equations I think are the ones relating temperature, volume, and pressure in such a process.

Wait, for an adiabatic process (Q=0), the first law tells us that ΔU = -W. And since it's reversible, we can use those specific equations. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact relations. Oh right, for an ideal gas, the internal energy depends only on temperature, so any change in temperature reflects a change in internal energy.

I think the important equations here are:

1. For an adiabatic process: TV^(γ-1) = constant
2. Alternatively, PV^γ = constant

But wait, maybe I should use the relation involving temperature and pressure changes. I'm not sure. Also, I remember that for an ideal gas, the relation between Cp and Cv is Cp = γCv, where γ is the heat capacity ratio (Cp/Cv). So if I can find γ, I can find Cp if I know Cv, or vice versa.

Wait, but the question mentions that by measuring the temperature drop and the pressure drop, we can find γ and then Cp. So perhaps I don't need to know Cv beforehand.

Let me think about the process. The gas expands adiabatically and reversibly. So, the initial state is (T1, P1, V1), and the final state is (T2, P2, V2). And we know that V2 = 2 V1, since it's expanding to twice its volume.

I think the key equations for this scenario are:

(T2 / T1) = (V1 / V2)^(γ-1)
and
(P2 / P1) = (V1 / V2)^γ

Wait, because for an adiabatic process, the relation between T and V is T1^(γ-1) P1^(-γ+1) = T2^(γ-1) P2^(-γ+1), but maybe it's easier to use the direct ratios.

Alternatively, I can relate the temperatures and volumes using the adiabatic condition. Since the volume doubles, V2 = 2 V1. So the ratio V1/V2 is 1/2.

So, (T2/T1) = (1/2)^(γ-1)

Similarly, (P2/P1) = (1/2)^γ

But I have both T and P changes, so maybe I can calculate γ in two ways and check for consistency, or perhaps find it from one and verify with the other.

Let me compute the temperatures and pressures first.

T1 = 298.15 K
T2 = 248.44 K
So T2/T1 = 248.44 / 298.15 ≈ let me calculate that. Let's see, 248.44 divided by 298.15.

Hmm, 298.15 is approximately 298.15 ≈ 300. Let's compute it more accurately:

248.44 / 298.15 ≈ 0.8333. Because 298 * 0.833 is about 248 (since 300 * 0.833 is 250). So approx 5/6 maybe? Because 5/6 is roughly 0.8333.

Wait 5/6 is 0.833333..., so that could be a hint. So T2/T1 = 5/6.

So, (T2/T1) = (V1/V2)^(γ-1) → (5/6) = (1/2)^(γ-1)

Similarly, P1 is 202.94 kPa, P2 is 81.840 kPa.

P2/P1 = 81.840 / 202.94 ≈ let's compute this. 81.84 is approximately 82, and 202.94 is about 203.

82 / 203 ≈ 0.404. Let me calculate more accurately.

81.840 / 202.94 = Let's compute 81840 / 202940. Wait, perhaps better to use calculator steps.

202.94 * 0.4 = 81.176 → 0.4 gives 81.176, which is close to 81.84. So 0.4 plus a bit.

The difference is 81.84 - 81.176 = 0.664. So 0.664 / 202.94 ≈ 0.00327, so total P2/P1 ≈ 0.40327, approximately 0.4033.

So P2/P1 ≈ 0.4033.

Now, from the adiabatic relations:

(T2/T1) = (V1/V2)^(γ-1) → (5/6) = (1/2)^(γ-1)

Similarly,

(P2/P1) = (V1/V2)^γ → 0.4033 = (1/2)^γ

Hmm, so now I can solve for γ from either equation and see if they are consistent.

Let me take the pressure ratio first.

Take natural logs on both sides:

ln(P2/P1) = γ * ln(V1/V2)

V1/V2 is 1/2, so ln(1/2) is -ln(2) ≈ -0.6931.

So, ln(0.4033) ≈ I'll compute that. Let me think: ln(0.5) is about -0.6931, and 0.4033 is less than 0.5, so ln(0.4033) is lower. Let's compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps use exact calculation.

ln(0.4033) = ?

We know that e^(-0.9) ≈ 0.4066, which is close to 0.4033.

Wait, e^(-0.9) ≈ 0.4066. So, ln(0.4066) ≈ -0.9.

So ln(0.4033) is a little lower. Let's compute it.

Let me compute 0.4033.

We can use the approximation ln(x) ≈ (x-1) - (x-1)^2/2 + (x-1)^3/3 - ... but perhaps it's easier to use linear approximation between known points.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to just proceed with the equations.

So, taking the pressure ratio:

ln(0.4033) = γ * ln(1/2)

Which is ln(0.4033) = γ (-0.6931)

So:

γ = [ln(0.4033)] / (-0.6931)

Compute ln(0.4033):

I'll use a calculator approximation. Let me recall that ln(0.4) is about -0.916291. Since 0.4033 is a bit higher than 0.4, the ln would be a bit higher (less negative).

Let me compute it more accurately.

The exact value isn't critical because the problem should have an exact solution based on the given data, but perhaps I can compute it numerically.

Wait, perhaps using the relation between the two equations to solve for γ.

Another approach: Let's denote x = V2/V1 = 2. So V2=2 V1, so V1/V2 = 1/2.

We have:

(T2/T1) = (1/2)^(γ-1) → equation 1

(P2/P1) = (1/2)^γ → equation 2

Taking the ratio of equation 1 to equation 2's (γ-1)/γ power? Hmm, perhaps it's better to take logarithms of both.

Alternatively, let me take equation 1 and write it as:

ln(T2/T1) = (γ-1) * ln(1/2)

Equation 2:

ln(P2/P1) = γ * ln(1/2)

So, let's compute the two left-hand sides.

Compute ln(T2/T1):

T2=248.44, T1=298.15.

T2/T1 = 248.44 / 298.15 ≈ 0.8333 → 5/6 ≈ 0.8333.

ln(5/6) = ln(5) - ln(6) ≈ 1.6094 - 1.7918 ≈ -0.1824.

So, equation 1 becomes:

-0.1824 = (γ - 1) * (-0.6931)

Divide both sides by -0.6931:

(γ - 1) = (-0.1824)/(-0.6931) ≈ 0.1824 / 0.6931 ≈ 0.263.

So, γ ≈ 1 + 0.263 ≈ 1.263.

Now, equation 2:

ln(P2/P1) = ln(0.4033) ≈ let's compute this accurately.

As I thought earlier, 0.4033 is approximately e^(-0.91) since e^(-0.9)=0.4066, which is close. Let me compute ln(0.4033).

Another approach: Let me calculate the actual value.

Let me recall that ln(0.4) ≈ -0.916291, ln(0.41) is about -0.89431, ln(0.4033) is between those.

Let me compute 0.4033.

Let me do a linear approximation. Let me take x=0.4, ln(x) = -0.916291.

At x=0.40, the derivative of ln(x) is 1/x = 2.5.

So, for a small change δx, ln(x+δx) ≈ ln(x) + δx/(x).

So, 0.4033 is 0.4 + 0.0033.

So, ln(0.4033) ≈ ln(0.4) + (0.0033)/0.4 → -0.916291 + 0.00825 ≈ -0.908041.

Wait, but that doesn't make sense because at x=0.41, ln(0.41) is about -0.8943, which is higher than ln(0.4). So perhaps a better approach is to use a more accurate method.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the exact value using a calculator, but since I don't have one, I'll proceed with the approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute from equation 2.

Equation 2: ln(P2/P1) = γ * ln(1/2)

So, ln(0.4033) = γ * (-0.6931)

From equation 1, we found γ ≈ 1.263.

So, let me plug that into equation 2 to see if it holds.

Compute RHS: 1.263 * (-0.6931) ≈ -0.877.

But the LHS is ln(0.4033) ≈ -0.908.

Hmm, these aren't matching exactly, suggesting that perhaps the approximation from equation 1 is leading to a γ that doesn't satisfy equation 2. So perhaps I should solve for γ more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I can create a system of equations. Let me denote:

Equation 1: ln(T2/T1) = (γ - 1) * ln(1/2) → equation A

Equation 2: ln(P2/P1) = γ * ln(1/2) → equation B

I can write equation A as:

ln(T2/T1) = (γ -1) * ln(V1/V2) → since V2=2V1, V1/V2=1/2.

Similarly, equation B is:

ln(P2/P1) = γ * ln(V1/V2)

So, let me compute the values:

ln(T2/T1) = ln(248.44/298.15) ≈ ln(0.8333) ≈ -0.1823

ln(P2/P1) = ln(81.840/202.94) ≈ ln(0.4033) ≈ let's say approximately -0.908.

Wait, perhaps I can compute it more accurately. Let me think: 81.84 / 202.94 = 0.4033. Let me compute ln(0.4033).

I can use the Taylor series expansion around a point where I know the value. Let me take x=0.4, where ln(0.4)=-0.916291.

The derivative of ln(x) at x=0.4 is 1/0.4=2.5.

So, for x=0.4033, which is 0.4 + 0.0033, the ln(x) ≈ ln(0.4) + 2.5*(0.0033) → -0.916291 + 0.00825 = -0.908041.

So, ln(0.4033) ≈ -0.908041.

So, equation B becomes:

-0.908041 = γ * (-0.6931)

Thus, γ = (-0.908041) / (-0.6931) ≈ 1.309.

Wait, that's a different value than what I got from equation A (γ≈1.263). Hmm, but these should be the same γ. So perhaps there's a mistake in my approach.

Wait, perhaps I should set up the equations correctly.

Let me write equation A and equation B again.

Equation A: ln(T2/T1) = (γ -1) * ln(V1/V2)

Equation B: ln(P2/P1) = γ * ln(V1/V2)

Let me write them with actual numbers.

Equation A: -0.1823 = (γ -1) * (-0.6931)

Equation B: -0.9080 = γ * (-0.6931)

From equation B:

γ = (-0.9080) / (-0.6931) ≈ 1.309.

Wait, but that would mean from equation A:

-0.1823 = (1.309 -1) * (-0.6931) → (0.309)(-0.6931) = -0.2143, which does not equal -0.1823.

So there's a discrepancy here. That suggests that perhaps the initial assumption that the process is adiabatic and reversible for an ideal gas is leading to inconsistent γ values. That can't be right, so perhaps I'm making a mistake in the setup.

Wait, maybe the problem isn't with the equations but with the way I'm applying them. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the relation between T and P for an adiabatic process.

Wait, another approach: the relation between T and P in an adiabatic process for an ideal gas is:

(T2 / T1) = (P2 / P1)^( (γ-1)/γ )

So, let me write that equation.

(T2/T1) = (P2/P1)^( (γ -1)/γ )

Taking the natural log:

ln(T2/T1) = [(γ -1)/γ] * ln(P2/P1)

I can plug in the known values.

Compute ln(T2/T1) = ln(248.44/298.15) ≈ ln(0.8333) ≈ -0.1823.

ln(P2/P1) = ln(81.840/202.94) ≈ ln(0.4033) ≈ -0.9080.

So,

-0.1823 = [(γ -1)/γ] * (-0.9080)

Let me write this as:

[(γ -1)/γ] = (-0.1823) / (-0.9080) ≈ 0.2007.

So,

(γ -1)/γ ≈ 0.2007

Multiply both sides by γ:

γ -1 = 0.2007 γ

Bring terms together:

γ - 0.2007 γ = 1 → 0.7993 γ = 1 → γ ≈ 1 / 0.7993 ≈ 1.251.

Hmm, so γ ≈ 1.251 from this equation. Let me see if this is consistent with the previous equations.

Wait, from equation B earlier, when I used P ratio, I got γ≈1.309, but that led to inconsistency. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to use this equation which combines T and P changes.

So, from the combined equation, I get γ≈1.251.

Let me check with equation A and B.

Equation A: ln(T2/T1) = (γ-1) * ln(V1/V2)

So, (γ-1) = [ln(T2/T1)] / ln(V1/V2) → [ (-0.1823) ] / (-0.6931) ≈ 0.263.

So, γ-1=0.263 → γ=1.263.

Wait, but that's inconsistent with the 1.251 from the combined equation. Hmm, so perhaps I made a calculation error.

Wait, let me recompute the combined equation.

(T2/T1) = (P2/P1)^( (γ-1)/γ )

So,

(248.44/298.15) = (81.840/202.94)^( (γ-1)/γ )

Compute the left side: 248.44 / 298.15 ≈ 0.8333.

Right side base: 81.840 / 202.94 ≈ 0.4033.

So:

0.8333 = 0.4033^[(γ-1)/γ]

Take natural logs:

ln(0.8333) = [(γ-1)/γ] * ln(0.4033)

Compute each term:

ln(0.8333) ≈ -0.1823

ln(0.4033) ≈ -0.9080

So,

-0.1823 = [(γ-1)/γ] * (-0.9080)

Multiply both sides by (-1):

0.1823 = [(γ-1)/γ] * 0.9080

So,

[(γ-1)/γ] = 0.1823 / 0.9080 ≈ 0.2007

Thus,

(γ -1)/γ = 0.2007 → γ -1 = 0.2007 γ → γ - 0.2007 γ = 1 →
