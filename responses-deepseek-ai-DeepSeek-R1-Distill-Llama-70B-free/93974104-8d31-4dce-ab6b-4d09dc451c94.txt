Question:

A manufacturer of motor oil is interested in testing the effects of a newly developed additive on the lifespan of an engine. Twenty-five different engine types are selected at random and each one is tested using oil with the additive and oil without the additive. What type of analysis will yield the most useful information?

Options:

A: Independent samples t-test for population proportions
B: Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
C: One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
D: Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA)
E: Paired t-test for population proportions
F: Independent samples comparison of population proportions
G: Matched pairs comparison of population proportions
H: Chi-square test for independence
I: Matched pairs comparison of population means
J: Independent samples comparison of population means

Okay, so I've got this statistics question to tackle. Let me read it carefully and think through what's going on here.

The question is about a motor oil manufacturer testing a new additive's effect on engine lifespan. They've selected 25 different engine types. Each engine is tested with oil that has the additive and without it. I need to figure out what type of analysis would give the most useful info here.

Hmm, so each engine is tested twice—once with additive, once without. That makes me think it's a paired setup because the same subject (engine) is being used in both conditions. So this isn't an independent sample where different groups are used for each condition.

Let me go through the options one by one. 

Option A: Independent samples t-test for population proportions. Wait, t-tests are usually for means, not proportions. Unless it's a proportion like success rates, but here we're looking at lifespan, which is a continuous variable, not a proportion. So maybe not A.

Option B: Two-way ANOVA. That's used when you have two independent variables. For example, if we had different engine types and different additives. But here, the additive is the same across all engines, so maybe not two-way. Unless engine type is another variable, but the question is about the additive's effect, not comparing engine types.

Option C: One-way ANOVA. That would compare three or more groups. But here, we have two conditions (with and without additive) for each engine. So one-way might not fit unless we're looking at more than two groups, which we aren't. So probably not C.

Option D: Repeated measures ANOVA. That's used when the same subjects are measured multiple times. Oh wait, that's exactly our case. Each engine is tested twice—once with additive, once without. So this seems like a possible candidate.

Option E: Paired t-test for proportions. Again, t-test is for means, and paired for same subjects. But if the data is proportions, maybe. But lifespan is a mean variable. So probably not E.

Option F: Independent samples comparison of proportions. Again, proportions don't fit here. Lifespan is a mean.

Option G: Matched pairs comparison of population proportions. Same issue as E and F. Proportions don't fit, and it's about means.

Option H: Chi-square test. That's for categorical data, like counting successes or failures. Lifespan is continuous, so not H.

Option I: Matched pairs comparison of population means. Oh wait, that sounds a lot like a paired t-test. Because each engine's mean lifespan is being compared between two conditions. So this would be the right analysis if we're looking at two related samples.

Option J: Independent samples comparison of means. That would be if different engines are used for each condition. But here, each engine is used in both, so they're not independent samples. So J is out.

Wait, so what's the difference between D and I? D is repeated measures ANOVA, which can handle multiple measurements. In this case, each engine is measured twice, so that's two levels. But ANOVA is typically used when comparing means across three or more groups. Wait, no—if there are only two measurements, isn't that more like a paired t-test?

Wait, in this case, the question is about the effect of the additive on the lifespan. So for each engine, you have two data points: lifespan with additive and without. So the appropriate test would be a paired t-test, which is option I. Because it's comparing two related samples' means.

Alternatively, if they had done more than two conditions (like different concentrations of additive), then repeated measures ANOVA might come into play. But here, it's just two conditions, so paired t-test makes sense.

So looking back, the options are I and D. The question is whether it's a paired t-test (I) or repeated measures ANOVA (D). Since there are only two conditions, the paired t-test is the correct choice, which is option I. Repeated measures ANOVA is more for when you have three or more measurements for each subject.

The question involves testing the effect of a newly developed additive on engine lifespan. Twenty-five different engine types are tested with oil containing the additive and without it. Since each engine is tested under both conditions, the data represents paired observations. The goal is to determine the most appropriate statistical analysis for this scenario.

- **Option A**: Independent samples t-test for population proportions is not suitable because the data involves continuous variables (lifespan) rather than proportions.  
- **Option B**: Two-way ANOVA is used when there are two independent variables, which is not the case here. The focus is solely on the additive's effect, not on comparing engine types.  
- **Option C**: One-way ANOVA is used to compare means across three or more groups, but here there are only two conditions (with and without the additive).  
- **Option D**: Repeated measures ANOVA is appropriate when the same subjects are measured multiple times. While this applies to the engines being tested twice, repeated measures ANOVA is typically used for three or more measurements, not just two.  
- **Option E**: Paired t-test for population proportions is incorrect because the data involves means, not proportions.  
- **Option F**: Independent samples comparison of proportions is unsuitable because the data is not about proportions.  
- **Option G**: Matched pairs comparison of population proportions is also incorrect because the data involves means, not proportions.  
- **Option H**: Chi-square test for independence is used for categorical data, which does not apply here since lifespan is a continuous variable.  
- **Option I**: Matched pairs comparison of population means is appropriate because it involves comparing the means of two related samples (lifespan with and without the additive for the same engines). This corresponds to a paired t-test.  
- **Option J**: Independent samples comparison of population means is incorrect because the samples are not independent; the same engines are used in both conditions.  

Given that there are only two conditions and the data involves paired observations, the most appropriate analysis is a paired t-test, which corresponds to **Option I**. While repeated measures ANOVA (Option D) could theoretically apply, it is more suited for scenarios with three or more measurements.
