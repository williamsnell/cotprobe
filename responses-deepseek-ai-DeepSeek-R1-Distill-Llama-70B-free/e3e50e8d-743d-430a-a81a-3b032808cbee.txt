Okay, so I've got this audit question here about interim audit procedures and what to do when unexpected errors are found. Hmm. Let's try to think through this step by step.

The question is about accounts receivable. During an interim audit, they found numerous unexpected errors, which caused a change in the risk assessment. So, the auditor's risk assessment has gone up, right? Because more errors mean higher risk that the financial statements might be misstated.

The options are A through H. I need to figure out which is the best response.

First, I remember that when the auditor's risk assessment increases, they need to adjust their audit procedures to get more evidence. They might need to do more testing or change the nature of their tests.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Send negative AR confirmations instead of positive. Wait, positive confirmations ask the customer to reply, negative just ask them to respond only if there's a discrepancy. If the risk is higher, maybe they want more reliable evidence, so positive might be better. Not sure yet.

Option B: Use more experienced team members for year-end testing. That makes sense because if the risk is higher, having more experienced people could help in doing a better job in testing. But is this the most appropriate response?

Option C: Ignore the errors if not material. No, because even if not material now, the errors indicate a higher risk, so ignoring isn't right. Plus, materiality can change as more errors are found.

Option D: Use less experienced. That doesn't make sense if the risk is higher. Less experienced might miss things, so this is probably wrong.

Option E: Decrease sampling. Wait, if more errors were found, maybe the initial sample wasn't sufficient. Decreasing sampling might mean testing more items, which could help. Or maybe increasing sample size. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe they should use a different approach than sampling, but I'm not certain.

Option F: Perform fewer procedures. No, higher risk should mean more procedures, not fewer. So F is probably incorrect.

Option G: Move detailed analytical procedures from interim to year-end. Hmm, analytical procedures are usually done in interim to identify risks. If they find errors, maybe they need more detailed procedures at year-end. But moving them might not address the issue. Or perhaps they should do more at year-end regardless. Not sure.

Option H: Increase the dollar threshold for vouching. That would mean they check fewer invoices, which seems counterintuitive if the risk is higher. So H might not be the right choice.

So, considering all of this, when the auditor finds more errors in interim, they would likely increase the extent of testing at year-end. So, maybe using more experienced people (B) would help, as they can perform more thorough tests. Alternatively, maybe increasing the sample size or using different methods.

Wait, another thought: when the risk assessment changes, the auditor might adjust the nature, timing, and extent of procedures. So, perhaps they need to do more detailed work at year-end. One way is to have more experienced people do the testing, as they can handle more complex or judgmental areas. So B could be a good option.

Alternatively, maybe they should perform more substantive procedures, like more confirmations or tests. Option A suggests using negative confirmations, but if the risk is higher, positive might be better because they get a response. But the question is about the response to the errors found in interim. So maybe instead of just sending confirmations, they should do something else.

Wait, another point: the initial audit plan might have been based on a lower risk assessment. Now that the risk is higher, the auditor needs to gather more evidence. So, perhaps they should increase the extent of testing. That could mean more transactions are tested, which might involve more sampling or different methods.

Looking back at the options, option E says decrease the use of sampling. If they decrease sampling, does that mean they test more? Or do they test less? Wait, if you use less sampling, you might be testing more items individually, which could increase the work. Alternatively, maybe they switch from sampling to a more comprehensive approach. So if the risk is higher, they might test more transactions outside of just a sample, which would support option E.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: when the auditor's assessment of risk increases, they would likely increase the sufficiency of evidence. So, more testing, perhaps more detailed, more transactions, and maybe more experienced staff to ensure the testing is done properly.

So, between options B and E. Option B is about using more experienced team members, which could help in doing a better job. Option E is about decreasing the use of sampling, which might mean more extensive testing.

Wait, what's the usual approach when risk increases? The auditor would likely increase the extent of testing. If they were using sampling, maybe they would take a larger sample, or perhaps test specific items that are higher risk. Decreasing the use of sampling could mean moving away from statistical sampling to more judgmental selection, but that might not necessarily increase the number of items tested. Alternatively, maybe they just test more items, whether through sampling or not.

Alternatively, another thought: if in the interim they found errors, perhaps the initial sampling was insufficient. So, at year-end, they might need to do more detailed testing, perhaps by increasing the sample size. But the question is about which response is most appropriate given the change in risk assessment.

Another point: when the risk increases, the auditor may decide to perform more substantive procedures at year-end rather than relying on interim work. So, perhaps they would do more detailed work, like more confirmations, more vouching, etc.

Looking again, option A is about changing from positive to negative confirmations. Positive is more reliable because you get a response. Negative is less reliable. If the risk is higher, the auditor might prefer positive confirmations. So, option A is suggesting to switch to negative, which seems counterintuitive. So A is probably not the answer.

So, going back, the options are B and E. Which is better?

Option B: Use more experienced team members. This makes sense because more experienced auditors can handle more complex areas, assess risks better, and perform more effective tests.

Option E: Decrease the use of sampling. Decreasing sampling might mean testing more transactions, which could be good, but I'm not sure if this is the most appropriate response. It depends on what the sampling was for. If the initial sampling was part of the interim, maybe they need to test more at year-end.

Wait, another point: if the interim procedures found errors, the auditor might decide to increase the scope of their year-end audit. That could involve not just relying on sampling but perhaps testing all high-value items or using more detailed tests. So, perhaps they decrease the use of sampling and test more items, or perhaps they increase the sample size.

But the question is about the most appropriate response. So, which option reflects an increase in the extent or nature of testing.

Option B is about the team's experience, which affects the quality of the testing, but not necessarily the quantity.

Option E is about using less sampling, which could mean more extensive testing beyond the sample.

Alternatively, the correct answer might be B because more experienced auditors can better assess the risks and perform the necessary procedures.

Wait, I think I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to recall what the auditing standards say. When the auditor's risk assessment increases, they should modify their audit plan. This can include changing the timing, nature, or extent of procedures.

In this case, since the errors were found in the interim, the auditor may decide that the initial procedures were insufficient. Therefore, at year-end, they might do more detailed testing, perhaps by increasing the sample size, or using more experienced staff to perform more thorough testing.

So, option B says to use more experienced team members. That would make sense because more experienced auditors can better handle the complexities and assess the risks more accurately. It also allows for more effective testing, which is needed when the risk assessment increases.

Alternatively, option E suggests decreasing the use of sampling, which might mean testing more transactions outside of the sample. But I'm not entirely sure if that's the best approach here.

I think the key here is that when the risk assessment changes, the auditor needs to adjust the extent of testing. Using more experienced staff would allow for more effective and thorough testing, which is a common response to higher risk. So, the correct answer is probably B.

When performing interim audit procedures for accounts receivable, the discovery of numerous unexpected errors indicates a higher risk of material misstatement in the financial statements. This necessitates an appropriate adjustment to the audit plan to address the increased risk. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Switching to negative confirmations is less reliable than positive confirmations, as it does not ensure a response from customers. Given the higher risk, this would not be appropriate.  
- **Option B**: Using more experienced audit team members for year-end testing is a reasonable response, as their expertise can help identify and address complex issues more effectively.  
- **Option C**: Ignoring the errors is incorrect, as the increased risk warrants further investigation, regardless of materiality.  
- **Option D**: Using less experienced team members would be counterproductive, as higher risk requires more skilled auditors.  
- **Option E**: Decreasing the use of sampling might imply testing more transactions, but the question does not explicitly suggest that sampling was the issue.  
- **Option F**: Performing fewer procedures contradicts the need for more thorough testing in response to higher risk.  
- **Option G**: Moving analytical procedures from interim to year-end does not directly address the increased risk identified during interim testing.  
- **Option H**: Increasing the dollar threshold for vouching would reduce the number of invoices tested, which is inappropriate when risk is higher.

The most appropriate response is **Option B**, as using more experienced team members ensures that the year-end testing is conducted more effectively and thoroughly, addressing the increased risk assessment.
