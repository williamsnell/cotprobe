Okay, so I've got this question about graph theory and the complexity of certain problems. Let me try to break it down.

The question is about two problems, P1 and P2, involving finding paths between two vertices in a connected, undirected graph. P1 is to find the shortest simple path, and P2 is the longest simple path. I need to determine the correct statement about their solvability in polynomial time.

Hmm. I remember that finding the shortest path is a classic problem. Algorithms like Dijkstra's or BFS (for unweighted graphs) can do this efficiently, right? So for P1, since these algorithms run in polynomial time, P1 can be solved in polynomial time.

Now, P2 is about finding the longest simple path. Oh wait, I think the longest path problem is a lot harder. From what I recall, it's actually NP-hard. Because the problem of finding the longest simple path is similar to the Hamiltonian path problem, which is known to be NP-complete. So if the graph has weights, especially if they can be positive or negative, the problem becomes computationally intensive. Since the question is about simple paths (no cycles), and finding the longest one, I believe that's computationally intractable for large graphs. So P2 is not solvable in polynomial time; it's at least NP-hard, so no known polynomial-time algorithms exist for it.

Looking at the options:

Option J says P1 can be solved in poly time and P2 is not. That sounds correct. Let's check the other options to be sure.

Option A: Both are not solvable in poly time. No, because P1 is solvable.

Option B: Both can be solved. No, P2 can't.

Options C and E: They say P2 can be solved, which is wrong.

Options D and I: They state P2 is solvable, which is incorrect.

Option G: P1 is solvable, but says P2 isn't known. But wait, isn't P2 known to be NP-hard? So we do know P2 isn't solvable in poly time.

So the correct option should be J: P1 can be solved in poly time, and P2 cannot.

The question involves two problems, P1 and P2, related to finding paths in a connected, undirected graph. P1 is the problem of finding a shortest simple path between two vertices, while P2 is the problem of finding a longest simple path. The task is to determine which statement about their solvability in polynomial time is correct.

For P1, algorithms like Dijkstra's or BFS can find the shortest simple path efficiently, and these algorithms run in polynomial time. Therefore, P1 can be solved in polynomial time.

For P2, the longest simple path problem is known to be NP-hard. This is because it is closely related to the Hamiltonian path problem, which is NP-complete. As a result, no polynomial-time algorithms are known to exist for solving P2 in general graphs.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. P1 can be solved in polynomial time.
- **B**: Incorrect. P2 cannot be solved in polynomial time.
- **C, E**: Incorrect. P2 cannot be solved in polynomial time.
- **D, I**: Incorrect. P2 is not solvable in polynomial time.
- **G**: Incorrect. It is known that P2 is not solvable in polynomial time.
- **H**: Incorrect. P1 is known to be solvable in polynomial time.
- **J**: Correct. P1 can be solved in polynomial time, and P2 cannot.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**J: P1 can be solved in polynomial time and P2 is known to not be solvable in polynomial time.**
