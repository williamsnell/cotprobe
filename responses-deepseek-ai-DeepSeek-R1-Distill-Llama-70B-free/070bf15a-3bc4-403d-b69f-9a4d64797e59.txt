Okay, so I've got this psychology question here about learned helplessness. Hmm, I remember that learned helplessness is a concept I came across in my psychology class. Let me think. I think it was related to experiments where animals were subjected to some kind of aversive stimuli they couldn't escape, like electric shocks. After a while, they just stopped trying to avoid the shocks because they felt they couldn't do anything about it. So they became helpless.

Wait, what theory does this connect to? I'm trying to remember. Oh right, learned helplessness is part of the behavioral theories. But which one exactly? Let me think about the options given.

The question asks what learned helplessness is an example of. The options are A through J. Let's go through them.

Option A: Cognitive dissonance. That's when there's a conflict between beliefs and behaviors, leading to discomfort. I don't think that's related here.

Option B: Positive reinforcement. That's when a behavior is followed by a pleasing consequence, making it more likely to occur. Not sure if that's the case here.

Option C: Classical conditioning. That's Pavlov's dogs, right? Associating stimuli with responses. Learned helplessness doesn't seem to fit because it's more about behavior and consequences.

Option D: Intrinsic motivation. That's when you do something because it's rewarding in itself, not for external rewards. I don't see the connection.

Option E: Observational learning. That's learning by watching others, like Bandura's Bobo doll experiment. Not directly related to helplessness.

Option F: Modeling. Similar to observational learning, it's about imitating behavior. Doesn't fit here.

Option G: Expectation. That's about anticipating outcomes. Maybe, but I'm not sure if that's the main concept here.

Option H: Operant conditioning. Oh wait, operant conditioning is about behavior being modified by its consequences, like rewards or punishments. Learned helplessness is more about when a behavior doesn't lead to an escape from punishment, so the behavior stops. That sounds like operant conditioning because it's about the consequences of actions.

Option I: Negative reinforcement. That's when a behavior is strengthened by removing an unpleasant stimulus. But in learned helplessness, the aversive stimulus isn't removed, so the behavior stops, leading to helplessness. So maybe not negative reinforcement.

Option J: Social learning. That's a broader theory that includes observing and imitating, so maybe not directly the cause here.

So putting it together, learned helplessness is when an organism learns that its behavior doesn't affect the outcome, so it becomes passive. This seems related to operant conditioning because it's about the effectiveness of behavior in altering the environment. If the behavior (trying to escape) doesn't work, the organism stops trying, which is a change in behavior based on its consequences.

Wait, but isn't learned helplessness also tied to Seligman's work and the concept of learned helplessness leading to depression? Yes, but that still falls under behavioral theories.

So the correct answer should be H: operant conditioning.

Learned helplessness is a concept that arises when an organism learns that its behavior does not influence the outcome of an aversive situation, leading to passivity and a lack of effort to change the situation. This phenomenon is rooted in behavioral psychology and specifically relates to operant conditioning, which studies how behavior is modified by its consequences. In the case of learned helplessness, the absence of a positive outcome (e.g., escaping a stimulus) results in the behavior ceasing, as the organism learns that its actions are ineffective. This aligns with operant conditioning principles, where behavior is shaped by the presence or absence of desired outcomes.

The other options, such as cognitive dissonance, classical conditioning, and social learning, do not directly explain the mechanism behind learned helplessness. Therefore, the correct answer is:

H: operant conditioning

Answer: H
