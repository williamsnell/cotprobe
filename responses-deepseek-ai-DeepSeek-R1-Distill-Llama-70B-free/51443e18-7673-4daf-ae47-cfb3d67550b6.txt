Okay, so I've got this group theory question here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I'll try to think it through step by step. The question has two statements about groups, and I need to determine if they're true or false.

Statement 1 says that in a group, (ab)^{-2} equals b^{-2}a^{-2}. Hmm. I remember that in a group, the inverse of a product is the product of the inverses in reverse order. So generally, (ab)^{-1} = b^{-1}a^{-1}. So for the inverse squared, maybe it's like applying that rule twice. Let's see: (ab)^{-2} would be ((ab)^{-1})^2, right? Which would be (b^{-1}a^{-1}) squared. Wait, but how does that work when you square it?

In a non-abelian group, a and b might not commute, so (b^{-1}a^{-1})^2 isn't necessarily b^{-2}a^{-2}. Let me think: (b^{-1}a^{-1})(b^{-1}a^{-1}) = b^{-1}a^{-1}b^{-1}a^{-1}. Since the group is non-abelian, a^{-1} and b^{-1} might not commute. So this product would be b^{-1}(a^{-1}b^{-1})a^{-1}. But wait, a^{-1}b^{-1} is (ba)^{-1}, right? So maybe it's b^{-1}(ba)^{-1}a^{-1} = b^{-1}a^{-1}b^{-1}a^{-1}. That doesn't look like b^{-2}a^{-2}, unless a and b commute. So in general, Statement 1 would only hold if the group is abelian. Therefore, Statement 1 is not true in all groups, only in abelian ones.

Now, Statement 2 says that in a group, (ab)^n equals a^n b^n. I remember that in general, this is only true if a and b commute, which is again the case for abelian groups. In non-abelian groups, the expansion of (ab)^n would involve a more complicated expression because each multiplication introduces a new term. For example, (ab)^2 is abab, which isn't the same as a^2 b^2 unless ab=ba, meaning they commute. So Statement 2 is also only true in abelian groups, not in all groups.

Wait, but wait. The question is about whether these statements are true in a group. So if the group isn't necessarily abelian, then both statements are false in general. Because in non-abelian groups, (ab)^{-2} isn't b^{-2}a^{-2}, as shown earlier, and (ab)^n isn't a^n b^n either. So both statements are false in general.

Looking at the options, option C says both are false. Option A says Statement 1 is false and Statement 2 is true, which can't be right because Statement 2 isn't always true. Option E says Statement 1 is false for all groups (which is correct) and Statement 2 is true only for some groups (which is also correct). Hmm, wait, but the options are about the statements being true or false as given.

Wait, the options are a bit tricky. Let me read them again. The options are A through J, each making a claim about the two statements.

Option C says False, False. So both statements are false in general. That would be correct because in non-abelian groups, both don't hold. But what about abelian groups? In abelian groups, both statements would hold because a and b commute. So in abelian groups, both statements are true, but the question is about whether they hold in any group.

Wait, the question says, "In a group", so it's about whether they are always true in every group. So if a statement is sometimes true and sometimes false depending on the group, then the statement is false as a general rule.

So Statement 1 is (ab)^{-2}=b^{-2}a^{-2}. This isn't true in non-abelian groups, so it's false in general. Statement 2 is (ab)^n =a^n b^n, which is false in non-abelian groups, so it's also false in general.

So both statements are false in general. Therefore, the correct answer is option C: False, False.

Wait, but let me make sure. Let me think of specific examples. Take the symmetric group S3, which is non-abelian. Let a and b be two elements that don't commute. Let's say a is (1 2 3) and b is (1 2). Then ab would be (1 2 3)(1 2) = (1 3 2), and ba would be (1 2)(1 2 3) = (2 3). So ab is (1 3 2), which has order 3, and ba is (2 3), which has order 2.

Now, let's compute (ab)^2 and see if it's equal to a^2 b^2. ab is (1 3 2), so (ab)^2 is (1 3 2)^2 = (1 2 3). a^2 is (1 2 3)^2 = (1 3 2), and b^2 is (1 2)^2 = identity. So a^2 b^2 would be (1 3 2) * identity = (1 3 2). But (ab)^2 is (1 2 3), which is different from a^2 b^2. So Statement 2 is false here.

Similarly, looking at Statement 1: (ab)^{-2} should equal b^{-2} a^{-2}. Let's compute each side. (ab) is (1 3 2), so (ab)^{-1} is (1 2 3), and (ab)^{-2} is (1 2 3)^2 = (1 3 2). On the other side, b^{-2} is (since b is (1 2)) the identity, because b^2 is e. a^{-2} is (1 2 3)^{-2} = (1 3 2)^2 = (1 2 3). So b^{-2} a^{-2} is e * (1 2 3) = (1 2 3). But (ab)^{-2} is (1 3 2), which isn't equal to (1 2 3). So Statement 1 is also false in this group.

Thus, both statements are not true in general, so both are false. So the correct answer is option C: False, False.

To analyze the given statements about groups, let us evaluate each one carefully:

### Statement 1: In a group, \((ab)^{-2} = b^{-2}a^{-2}\)
- In a group, the inverse of a product is given by \((ab)^{-1} = b^{-1}a^{-1}\). Squaring both sides, we get \((ab)^{-2} = (b^{-1}a^{-1})^2 = b^{-1}a^{-1}b^{-1}a^{-1}\).
- In non-abelian groups, where elements do not necessarily commute, \(a^{-1}\) and \(b^{-1}\) may not commute. Thus, \((ab)^{-2} \neq b^{-2}a^{-2}\) in general.
- This statement holds only in abelian groups, where all elements commute. However, since the question asks about "a group" in general, this statement is **false**.

### Statement 2: In a group, \((ab)^n = a^n b^n\)
- Expanding \((ab)^n\) in a non-abelian group involves terms like \(abab\ldots ab\), which simplifies only if \(a\) and \(b\) commute. In general, \((ab)^n \neq a^n b^n\) unless the group is abelian.
- For example, in the symmetric group \(S_3\), taking \(a = (123)\) and \(b = (12)\), we find that \((ab)^2 \neq a^2 b^2\), demonstrating that this statement is **false** in non-abelian groups.
- Like Statement 1, this statement holds only in abelian groups. Since the question asks about "a group" in general, this statement is also **false**.

### Conclusion
Both statements are false in general because they do not hold in non-abelian groups. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C: False, False**
