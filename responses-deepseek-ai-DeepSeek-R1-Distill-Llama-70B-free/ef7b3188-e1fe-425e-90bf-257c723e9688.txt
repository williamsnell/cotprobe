Okay, so I've got this question about Alice, a 14-year-old who thinks everyone is staring at her because of a blemish on her forehead. The question is asking which concept from Elkind (1967) explains this belief. The options are A through J, but I remember that the main ones related to this are probably A, C, E, or something else.

I think Elkind discussed some specific concepts related to adolescent egocentrism. Wait, he talked about two main aspects: the personal fable and the imaginary audience. Let me try to remember what each means.

The personal fable is when adolescents believe they're unique and their experiences are special, leading to feelings of invulnerability. Like thinking they can't die or that their problems are worse than others. But in this case, Alice isn't talking about being unique or invulnerable, she's thinking everyone is looking at her. So maybe that's not the personal fable.

Then there's the imaginary audience. Oh right, that's when teens believe that other people are constantly watching and evaluating them. So they imagine an audience for their actions and appearance. That sounds exactly like what Alice is experiencing. She thinks everyone is focused on her blemish, so she's imagining an audience judging her.

Wait, but what about egocentrism? Egocentrism is a Piaget term, part of the formal operational stage, where adolescents have difficulty seeing things from others' perspectives. But isn't that more about cognitive development in problem-solving rather than social beliefs? So maybe it's not C.

So putting it together, the correct answer should be E: the imaginary audience.

The question revolves around Alice, a 14-year-old who believes everyone is staring at her due to a blemish on her forehead. According to Elkind (1967), this behavior is linked to specific cognitive and social developmental concepts. The key options to consider are:

- **Personal fable (A):** Involves adolescents believing their experiences are unique and they are invulnerable, which doesn't fit Alice's situation.
- **Imaginary audience (E):** Refers to the belief that others are constantly watching and judging them, which aligns perfectly with Alice's concern about being stared at.
- **Egocentrism (C):** A broader cognitive concept where individuals struggle to see others' perspectives, but it doesn't specifically address the social judgment aspect.

Alice's belief matches the "imaginary audience" concept, as she imagines others are focused on her appearance. 

Answer: E
