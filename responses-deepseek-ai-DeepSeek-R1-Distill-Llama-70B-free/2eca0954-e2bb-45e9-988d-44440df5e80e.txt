Okay, so I have this economics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The government decides to increase both government spending and taxes by the same amount, keeping the budget balanced. The MPC is 0.75. I need to determine the policy direction, expenditure multiplier, and tax multiplier from the given options.

Hmm, I remember that when the government increases spending and taxes equally, it's a bit different from when they change either one alone. So, I think this is a balanced budget situation where spending and taxes go up by the same amount.

First, I need to figure out if this is expansionary or contractionary. Wait, expansionary policies are meant to stimulate the economy, increasing output and employment, while contractionary do the opposite.

When the government increases spending, that's expansionary because it directly adds to aggregate demand. But raising taxes could be contractionary because it takes money away from consumers, reducing their spending. But since both are increased by the same amount, I need to see which effect is stronger.

I remember that the expenditure multiplier is different from the tax multiplier. Oh right, the expenditure multiplier is 1/(1 - MPC) and the tax multiplier is -MPC/(1 - MPC). Wait, no, wait. Let me think again.

Wait, the expenditure multiplier (when government spending increases) is 1/(1 - MPC). The tax multiplier (when taxes increase) is the negative of MPC/(1 - MPC). Because when taxes go up, disposable income decreases, leading to less consumption.

So, the expenditure multiplier is larger in magnitude than the tax multiplier because the denominator is the same but the numerator for the expenditure multiplier is 1, while for taxes it's MPC. Since MPC is 0.75, the expenditure multiplier would be 1/(1 - 0.75) = 1/0.25 = 4. The tax multiplier would be -0.75/(1 - 0.75) = -0.75/0.25 = -3.

Wait, so when the government increases spending by, say, $100, the total increase in GDP would be $400 (because 100 *4). But when taxes increase by $100, the decrease would be 100 * (-3) = -300. So when both happen by the same amount, what's the net effect?

Let me think. If G increases by ΔG and T increases by ΔT, and ΔG = ΔT. So the change in equilibrium income (Y) would be the expenditure multiplier times ΔG plus the tax multiplier times ΔT. But since ΔG = ΔT = let's say Δ, this becomes (4Δ) + (-3Δ) = Δ(4 -3) = Δ. So the net effect is an increase in Y by Δ. So that suggests it's expansionary.

Wait, but that seems a bit counterintuitive. Because if you raise taxes and spending equally, the net effect is positive? Hmm, maybe because government spending has a larger multiplier effect than taxes. Because when the government spends, it directly adds to demand, whereas higher taxes reduce consumer spending but the effect isn't as strong as the spending increase.

So the policy direction should be expansionary because the net effect is positive. So the policy is expansionary.

Now, looking at the options, I need to find which option says expansionary, with expenditure multiplier 4 and tax multiplier -3.

Wait, the expenditure multiplier is 4 and tax multiplier is -3. Looking back at the options:

Option I: expansionary, 4, -3.

Other options: let me check. Option B is expansionary, 4, 3. No, because tax multiplier would be -3, not 3. So Option I seems right.

Wait, let me double-check the formulas. Expenditure multiplier is 1/(1 - MPC) → 1/(0.25) =4. Tax multiplier is (-MPC)/(1 - MPC) → (-0.75)/0.25= -3. So yes, that's correct.

So the policy is expansionary because the overall effect is positive. So the correct answer should be expansionary, with those multipliers.

Looking back at the options, Option I says expansionary, expenditure multiplier 4, tax multiplier -3. So that's the correct choice.

The government increases both government spending and taxes by the same amount, maintaining a balanced budget, with an MPC of 0.75. To determine the policy direction, expenditure multiplier, and tax multiplier:

1. **Policy Direction**:  
   - Increasing government spending is expansionary because it directly boosts aggregate demand.  
   - Increasing taxes is contractionary because it reduces disposable income and consumer spending.  
   - However, the expenditure multiplier (4) is larger in magnitude than the tax multiplier (-3), so the net effect is expansionary.

2. **Expenditure Multiplier**:  
   The formula for the expenditure multiplier is:  
   \[
   \text{Expenditure Multiplier} = \frac{1}{1 - \text{MPC}} = \frac{1}{1 - 0.75} = 4
   \]

3. **Tax Multiplier**:  
   The formula for the tax multiplier is:  
   \[
   \text{Tax Multiplier} = -\frac{\text{MPC}}{1 - \text{MPC}} = -\frac{0.75}{1 - 0.75} = -3
   \]

4. **Net Effect**:  
   When government spending and taxes increase by the same amount, the net effect on equilibrium income is:  
   \[
   \Delta Y = (4 \cdot \Delta G) + (-3 \cdot \Delta T) = \Delta G (4 - 3) = \Delta G
   \]  
   This positive net effect confirms the policy is expansionary.

From the options, the correct choice is **Option I**: expansionary, expenditure multiplier = 4, tax multiplier = -3.
