Okay, so I have this biology question here about the medulla oblongata. Hmm, I remember that the medulla is part of the brainstem. Let me think. The brainstem has three main parts: midbrain, pons, and medulla. The medulla is the lowest part, connecting the pons to the spinal cord.

What does the medulla do? I think it's responsible for controlling some of the automatic functions of the body. Like breathing, heart rate, blood pressure. Oh right, it regulates vital functions that we don't consciously control. So if someone's medulla is destroyed, those functions would be affected.

The question says a person sustained major injuries that destroyed the medulla. So what happens then? Well, if the medulla can't regulate breathing, the person would stop breathing. If you can't breathe, you can't get oxygen to the brain and other vital organs. Without oxygen, the brain would quickly lose function, leading to death.

Wait, but let me think about the options. The options are A through J. Let me go through them:

A: Difficulty swallowing. Swallowing is controlled by the medulla too, I believe. So that's possible, but is that the immediate cause?

B: Paralyzed. The medulla is part of the brainstem, but motor functions are more related to the spinal cord and other parts. Wait, the medulla does have control over some cranial nerves. But paralysis... maybe, but I'm not certain.

C: Hearing loss. Hearing is managed by the auditory nerve and parts of the temporal lobe. Unless the injury affects those areas, hearing might not be affected. The medulla's destruction wouldn't directly cause hearing loss.

D: Fall into a coma. A coma is a deep unconscious state. If the brainstem is damaged, that can cause a coma, but wait, the medulla is part of the brainstem. So if it's destroyed, that could lead to a coma, but if the vital functions stop, maybe death comes first.

E: Lose sense of smell. The olfactory system is in the forebrain, so medulla damage wouldn't affect that.

F: Speech impairment. Speech is controlled by areas like Broca's area in the frontal lobe. Unless the injury affects those areas, speech wouldn't be impacted. But wait, the medulla does have some cranial nerves, like the ones for swallowing and maybe some involved in speech. But severe speech impairment... I'm not too sure.

G: Memory loss. Memory is usually associated with the hippocampus and temporal lobe. Medulla damage wouldn't cause memory issues.

H: Blindness. Vision is handled by the occipital lobe and the optic nerves. Medulla destruction doesn't affect vision.

I: Die. Since the medulla controls breathing, heart rate, etc., destruction would lead to failure of these functions. So yes, the person would die. 

J: Lose sense of touch. Touch is processed in the parietal lobe. Unless the spinal cord is damaged, which carries touch signals, but the medulla is part of the brainstem. Maybe if the spinal cord is severed, but the question is about medulla destruction.

So putting it together, if the medulla is destroyed, the person would stop breathing and their heart would stop. Without these, they can't survive. So the immediate cause would be death. So the correct answer would be I: die.

Wait, but option D is fall into a coma. Could a coma happen before death? Well, I think if the brainstem is damaged, a person can become comatose. But if the medulla is destroyed, the vital functions would cease, leading to death rather than a coma. Because a coma is when the brain isn't functioning but the body might still be alive with life support. But in this case, the body's autonomic functions are gone, so death is immediate.

So the answer should be I.

The medulla oblongata is a critical part of the brainstem responsible for controlling vital automatic functions such as breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure. If the medulla is destroyed, these functions cease, leading to respiratory and cardiac arrest, which result in death. While other options like difficulty swallowing (A) or falling into a coma (D) could theoretically occur, the immediate and most severe consequence of medulla destruction is the loss of vital functions, making death the correct answer.

Answer: I
