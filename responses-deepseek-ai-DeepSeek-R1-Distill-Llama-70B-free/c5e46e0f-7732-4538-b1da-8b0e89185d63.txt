Okay, so I have this question about John Rawls and the Priority of the Other Person (POP) principle. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on Rawls, but I'll try to think it through. Let's see... Rawls is known for his theory of justice, right? Specifically, "Justice as Fairness." And in that, he introduces the idea of the original position where people make decisions behind a veil of ignorance.

Wait, the question is about what the POP would opt for regarding 'social primary goods.' Social primary goods are things like rights, liberties, opportunities, income, wealth, and the social bases of self-respect. Rawls argues that rational individuals in the original position would prioritize these goods to ensure that the worst-off in society are as well-off as possible. This is the maximin principle, I think.

The options are A through D. Let's go through each one.

Option A: POP will choose wealth over a compassionate society. That doesn't sound right because Rawls isn't about just accumulating wealth. He's more concerned with ensuring fairness and equality, especially for the least advantaged.

Option B: POP will choose equality over power. This rings a bell. Rawls does prioritize equality, but he allows for inequalities only if they benefit the least advantaged. So maybe the POP would prefer equality, but not absolute equality, just fair distribution.

Option C: POP will be unselfish. I'm not sure. Rawls' theory is based on rational self-interest, but within the constraints of fairness. So being unselfish might not be the right term. The POP is more about mutual advantage under fair conditions.

Option D: POP will choose to protect the disabled. While protecting vulnerable groups is important, I don't recall Rawls specifically saying that the POP's main focus is on the disabled. It's more about the worst-off in general, which could include the disabled, but not exclusively.

So, putting it together, the POP is likely to choose principles that maximize the minimum level of primary goods. This would mean ensuring that inequalities are arranged to benefit the least advantaged. So, they would prioritize equality in a way that still allows for social and economic benefits for all. 

Between options B and D, B seems more aligned because it's about choosing equality, which is a broader principle that covers more than just protecting a specific group. Protecting the disabled is part of that, but not the entire picture.

Wait, but does option B say "equality over power"? I think Rawls' first principle is about equal basic liberties, and the second about fair equality of opportunity and the difference principle. So equality is a key aspect. Therefore, option B might be correct.

The question concerns John Rawls' theory of justice, specifically what the Priority of the Other Person (POP) would choose regarding 'social primary goods.' Rawls, in his theory of "Justice as Fairness," argues that individuals in the original position, behind a veil of ignorance, would prioritize principles that maximize the minimum level of primary goods for the least advantaged. This aligns with the maximin principle and the idea that inequalities are justifiable only if they benefit the worst-off.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** suggests the POP would choose wealth over a compassionate society, which contradicts Rawls' emphasis on fairness and equality rather than mere wealth accumulation.
- **Option B** states the POP would choose equality over power. This aligns with Rawls' prioritization of equality, particularly in his first principle of equal basic liberties and his second principle's focus on fair equality of opportunity and the difference principle.
- **Option C** claims the POP would be unselfish, but Rawls' framework is rooted in rational self-interest constrained by fairness, making "unselfishness" an inaccurate characterization.
- **Option D** suggests the POP would choose to protect the disabled. While protecting vulnerable groups is important, Rawls' focus is broader, encompassing the worst-off in general rather than specific groups like the disabled.

Given this analysis, **Option B** best reflects Rawls' principles, as the POP would prioritize equality over power to ensure fairness and justice for all.

Answer: B
