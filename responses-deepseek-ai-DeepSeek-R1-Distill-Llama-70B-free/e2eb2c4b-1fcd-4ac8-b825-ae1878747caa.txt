Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem to solve, and honestly, I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these concepts. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem is about the entropy change during the solidification of copper. Copper normally solidifies at 1356 K, but it can be supercooled to 1120 K, where it starts solidifying spontaneously. I need to find the entropy change for this solidification at 1120 K.

The data provided includes the heat capacities of liquid and solid copper, and the enthalpy change (ΔH°) for the process. Let me jot down the given data:

- Cp for liquid Cu (Cu(l)): 7.50 cal/(deg·mol)
- Cp for solid Cu (Cu(s)): 5.41 + 1.50e-3*T cal/(deg·mol)
- ΔH° = -3100 cal (I think this is the enthalpy change of fusion when it solidifies)

Wait, the reaction is Cu(l) ⇌ Cu(s), so the enthalpy change is for the solidification. Since it's exothermic, the ΔH is negative, which makes sense.

Entropy change (ΔS) for a phase transition at a specific temperature is given by ΔS = ΔH / T. But wait, that's only true when the process is at the equilibrium temperature, like the melting point. Oh right, because at the melting point (1356 K), the process is reversible, so ΔG is zero, and ΔS = ΔH_fus / T_fus.

But in this case, the solidification is happening at a lower temperature (1120 K). So I can't directly use that formula. Hmm, because when a substance solidifies below its melting point, the process is spontaneous, but the entropy change calculation might be a bit more involved.

Wait, maybe I should think about the entropy change for the process from the liquid at 1120 K to solid at 1120 K. To find ΔS, I might need to calculate the entropy change in two steps: first cooling the liquid from its melting point (1356 K) to 1120 K, then solidifying it, and perhaps considering any entropy change for the solid from 1120 K to 1356 K? Or maybe not. Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, maybe I can model the process as the entropy change when the liquid at 1120 K turns into solid at 1120 K. The overall entropy change would be the sum of the entropy change as the liquid cools down to 1120 K and then solidifies, but wait, the liquid is already at 1120 K, right? Or do I need to calculate the entropy change from the liquid at 1356 K to solid at 1120 K?

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the entropy change of the universe for the process, but since the question is about the system's entropy change, I need to think differently.

Wait, the entropy change of the system (Cu) when it solidifies at 1120 K. So the process is Cu(l) at 1120 K → Cu(s) at 1120 K.

To compute this, perhaps I can calculate the entropy change for the process using the enthalpy change at 1120 K, but I need to find the correct way to calculate ΔH at that temperature because ΔH° is given at the melting point (1356 K).

Ah, right! Because the given ΔH° is the enthalpy change at the transition temperature (1356 K), but when the process occurs at a different temperature (1120 K), we have to adjust for the heat capacities to find the actual ΔH at 1120 K.

So, the plan is:

1. Calculate the enthalpy change (ΔH) for the solidification process at 1120 K.
2. Use this ΔH and the temperature (1120 K) to find the entropy change ΔS = ΔH / T.

But wait, how do I calculate ΔH at 1120 K? Because the given ΔH is at 1356 K. So I need to account for the heat released or absorbed when cooling the liquid from 1356 K to 1120 K, and then the heat released when solidifying at 1120 K.

Wait, the overall process is: liquid at 1356 K → solid at 1120 K. Or perhaps, the process is at 1120 K, so we have liquid at 1120 K → solid at 1120 K.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the liquid is cooled from 1356 K to 1120 K, and then solidifies. Alternatively, maybe it's better to model the process as the solidification happening at 1120 K, so the enthalpy change at that temperature would be different.

Let me think: The enthalpy change at 1120 K (ΔH_T) can be calculated using the heat capacities of the liquid and solid phases.

The formula for ΔH at a different temperature T is:

ΔH_T = ΔH° + ∫(T_initial to T) [Cp(liquid) - Cp(solid)] dT

Wait, no. Because ΔH for the process Cu(l) → Cu(s) at T is given by:

ΔH_T = ΔH° (at T_m) + ∫(T_m to T) [Cp(liquid) - Cp(solid)] dT'

Wait, yes, because when you go from T_m (melting point) to a lower temperature T, you have to account for the heat released or absorbed in cooling the liquid and warming the solid.

Wait, no, let me think again. At T_m, the enthalpy change is ΔH_fus (which is negative, as fusion is melting, and solidification is the reverse). So for solidification at T_m, ΔH = -ΔH_fus.

Wait, the problem says ΔH° = -3100 cal. So that's the enthalpy change for solidification at T_m.

But when the solidification occurs at a lower temperature, T, the enthalpy change ΔH_T will be different.

So to compute ΔH_T, I can use Kirchhoff's law:

ΔH_T = ΔH° + ∫(T_m to T) [ Cp(liquid) - Cp(solid) ] dT

Wait, but wait, because when the temperature changes, the heat capacities affect the enthalpy change. So, the formula is:

ΔH at T = ΔH at T_m + (H_liquid at T - H_liquid at T_m) - (H_solid at T - H_solid at T_m)

But since the process is going from liquid at T_m to solid at T, perhaps it's better to write:

ΔH_T = H(solid, T) - H(liquid, T)

But H(solid, T) = H(solid, T_m) + ∫(T_m to T) Cp(solid) dT

Similarly, H(liquid, T) = H(liquid, T_m) + ∫(T_m to T) Cp(liquid) dT

Wait, but wait, if the temperature is lower than T_m, like 1120 K is less than 1356 K, then we're cooling the liquid from T_m to T, and then solidifying it.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to compute the enthalpy change for the process:

Cu(l) at T → Cu(s) at T.

The enthalpy change for this process would be:

ΔH = [H(solid at T) - H(liquid at T)]

But H(solid at T) can be expressed as H(solid at T_m) + ∫(T_m to T) Cp(solid) dT

Similarly, H(liquid at T) = H(liquid at T_m) + ∫(T_m to T) Cp(liquid) dT

So ΔH = [H(solid at T_m) - H(liquid at T_m)] + ∫(T_m to T) [Cp(solid) - Cp(liquid)] dT

But wait, H(solid at T_m) - H(liquid at T_m) is the negative of ΔH_fus, because ΔH_fus = H(liquid at T_m) - H(solid at T_m). Since solidification is the reverse, that term is -ΔH_fus.

Wait, the given ΔH° is -3100 cal, which is the enthalpy change for solidification at T_m. So that's H(solid at T_m) - H(liquid at T_m) = ΔH° = -3100 cal.

So putting it all together, ΔH at T is:

ΔH_T = ΔH° + ∫(T_m to T) [Cp(solid) - Cp(liquid)] dT'

Wait, let me make sure. The integral is from T_m (higher temperature) down to T (lower), so the temperature is decreasing. So T' goes from T_m to T, which is a lower value.

So, the integral becomes negative because T decreases.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to reverse the limits and adjust the sign:

ΔH_T = ΔH° + ∫(T to T_m) [Cp(liquid) - Cp(solid)] (-dT') → becomes + ∫(T to T_m) [Cp(liquid) - Cp(solid)] dT'

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me just write the equation correctly.

ΔH_T = ΔH° + ∫(T_m to T) [Cp(liquid) - Cp(solid)] dT

Wait no, because:

ΔH_T = [H(solid at T) - H(liquid at T)] = [H(solid at T_m) + ∫(T_m to T) Cp(solid) dT ] - [H(liquid at T_m) + ∫(T_m to T) Cp(liquid) dT ]

Which simplifies to:

[H(solid at T_m) - H(liquid at T_m)] + ∫(T_m to T) [Cp(solid) - Cp(liquid)] dT

Which is ΔH° + ∫(T_m to T) [Cp(solid) - Cp(liquid)] dT

Wait, but I think I had it the other way around earlier. Let me double-check.

The formula for ΔH at T is:

ΔH_T = ΔH° + ∫(T_initial to T_final) Cp dT

But in this case, T_initial is T_m, and T_final is T. So for the liquid, cooling from T_m to T, the change is ∫(T_m to T) Cp(liquid) dT, but since it's cooling, the enthalpy of the liquid decreases, so it's a negative contribution. Similarly, the solid is being warmed from T_m to T, but wait no, the solid is formed at T, so perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait no, perhaps the correct way is to consider that the liquid is cooling from T_m to T, which releases heat, and then the solid is at T. So the total enthalpy change for the process is the enthalpy of solid at T minus the enthalpy of liquid at T.

Which brings me back to:

ΔH_T = [H(solid, T) - H(liquid, T)] = [H(solid, T_m) + ∫(T_m to T) Cp(solid) dT ] - [H(liquid, T_m) + ∫(T_m to T) Cp(liquid) dT ]

So that becomes:

[H(solid, T_m) - H(liquid, T_m)] + ∫(T_m to T) [Cp(solid) - Cp(liquid)] dT

Which is ΔH° + ∫(T_m to T) [Cp(solid) - Cp(liquid)] dT

Wait, but since T < T_m, the integral from T_m to T is negative. So let me compute that integral.

Given:

Cp(solid) = 5.41 + 1.50e-3 * T cal/(deg·mol)
Cp(liquid) = 7.50 cal/(deg·mol)

So Cp(solid) - Cp(liquid) = (5.41 + 0.0015 T) - 7.50 = (-2.09) + 0.0015 T

The integral from T_m (1356 K) to T (1120 K) of [Cp(solid) - Cp(liquid)] dT.

Which is ∫ (from 1356 to 1120) [ (-2.09) + 0.0015 T ] dT

Let me compute this integral.

The integral of a linear function a + bT is aT + (b/2) T².

So the integral from 1356 to 1120 is:

[ (-2.09)*T + 0.0015/2 * T² ] evaluated at 1120 minus the same at 1356.

Compute each part:

At T = 1120:

Term1 = (-2.09) * 1120 = let's compute that.

2.09 * 1120: 2 * 1120 = 2240, 0.09*1120=100.8 → 2240 + 100.8 = 2340.8 → so -2340.8 cal/mol.

Term2 = 0.00075 * (1120)^2 → 0.00075 * (1254400) → 0.00075 * 1,254,400 = 942 cal/mol.

Wait wait, no, 0.0015/2 = 0.00075, correct.

So term2 at 1120: 0.00075 * (1120)^2 = 0.00075 * 1254400 = 942 cal/mol.

So total at 1120: (-2340.8) + 942 = (-1398.8) cal/mol.

At T = 1356:

Term1 = (-2.09)*1356 = let's compute:

2 * 1356 = 2712, 0.09 *1356=122.04 → 2712 + 122.04=2834.04 → so term1 is -2834.04 cal/mol.

Term2 = 0.00075 * (1356)^2.

Compute 1356^2: 1356 * 1356. Let me compute 1300^2=1,690,000. 56^2=3136. 2*1300*56=145,600. So 1,690,000 +145,600 + 3,136 = 1,690,000 + 145,600 is 1,835,600 + 3,136 is 1,838,736. So (1356)^2 = 1,838,736.

Multiply by 0.00075: 1,838,736 * 0.00075 = 1378.552 cal/mol.

So term2 at 1356 is 1378.552 cal/mol.

So total at 1356: (-2834.04) + 1378.552 = (-1455.488) cal/mol.

Now, the integral is [value at 1120] - [value at 1356] → (-1398.8) - (-1455.488) = (-1398.8 + 1455.488) = 56.688 cal/mol.

Wait, wait, no. The integral is from 1356 to 1120, so it's [value at 1120] - [value at 1356], which is (-1398.8) - (-1455.488) = 56.688 cal/mol.

So the integral is +56.688 cal/mol.

Now, ΔH_T = ΔH° + integral → ΔH° is -3100 cal/mol.

So ΔH_T = (-3100) + 56.688 = (-3043.312) cal/mol.

Wait, that seems a bit off. Wait, did I make a calculation mistake in the integral?

Let me double-check the integral calculation.

First, the function inside the integral is (-2.09) + 0.0015 T.

Integral from 1356 to 1120 of (-2.09 + 0.0015 T) dT.

Antiderivative is (-2.09)T + (0.0015/2) T^2 = (-2.09 T) + 0.00075 T².

At T=1120:
-2.09 * 1120 = -2340.8
0.00075 * (1120)^2 = 0.00075 * 1254400 = 942
So sum is (-2340.8 + 942) = -1398.8

At T=1356:
-2.09 * 1356 = let's compute:

2.09 * 1000 = 2090
2.09 * 356 = Let's see: 2.09 * 300=627, 2.09 *56= 117.04 → 627+117.04=744.04 → 2090 +744.04=2834.04 → so -2834.04
0.00075 * (1356)^2 = 0.00075 * 1,838,736 = 1378.552
So sum is (-2834.04 + 1378.552) = (-1455.488)

So the integral is (value at 1120) - (value at 1356) = (-1398.8) - (-1455.488) = 56.688 cal/mol.

Yes, that's correct. So ΔH_T is (-3100) + 56.688 = -3043.312 cal/mol.

Wait, but wait, I'm getting a more negative ΔH_T than ΔH°, which makes sense because at lower temperatures, the enthalpy change for solidification should be more negative (more exothermic), since the liquid is supercooled and releases more heat when solidifying.

Now, the entropy change ΔS is ΔH_T divided by T, but wait, is that correct?

Wait, entropy change for the process at temperature T is ΔS = ΔH_T / T.

But wait, in this case, the process is Cu(l) at T → Cu(s) at T. So the entropy change is ΔS = [S(solid) - S(liquid)] at T.

But another approach: for a process at constant temperature, the entropy change is ΔS = q_rev / T. But in this case, the process is happening at T, so it's a spontaneous process, so it's not reversible. Hmm, but perhaps it's still valid to compute ΔS as the entropy change of the universe, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the problem asks for
