Okay, so I've got this question about the Durbin-Watson statistic and its relation to the first-order autocorrelation coefficient. Hmm, I remember that the Durbin-Watson (DW) statistic is used to detect the presence of autocorrelation in the residuals from a regression analysis. But wait, how exactly does it relate to the autocorrelation coefficient?

I think the DW statistic measures the autocorrelation in the error terms, specifically the first-order. If the DW is close to zero, what does that mean? I recall that the DW statistic ranges from 0 to 4. When DW is around 2, it means there's no autocorrelation. If it's significantly less than 2, there's positive autocorrelation, and if it's significantly more than 2, negative autocorrelation.

Wait, wait. Let me get this straight. The formula for the DW statistic is something like 2(1 - ρ), where ρ is the first-order autocorrelation coefficient. Oh right, because the DW is approximately equal to 2 times (1 minus the first-order autocorrelation). So if DW is near zero, that would imply that 2(1 - ρ) is near zero. Let me solve for ρ in that case. 

So, 2(1 - ρ) ≈ 0 → 1 - ρ ≈ 0 → ρ ≈ 1. Oh wait, so the autocorrelation coefficient would be close to 1. But wait, that's positive one. So the first-order autocorrelation coefficient is near +1 when DW is close to zero.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me make sure. The DW statistic is calculated as [Σ(e_t - e_{t-1})²] / [Σe_t²]. Another way to think about it is that when errors are positively autocorrelated, the changes between successive errors are small, so the numerator is small, making the DW statistic small. Conversely, if errors are negatively autocorrelated, the changes are large, so the numerator is larger, making DW larger than 2.

Wait no, when autocorrelation is positive, the residuals tend to cluster, so the differences between consecutive residuals are small. So the numerator would be small, leading to a small DW statistic. So when DW is close to zero, it suggests strong positive autocorrelation, meaning the autocorrelation coefficient (ρ) is close to +1.

So looking at the options, the question is about when the DW is close to zero, what is the autocorrelation coefficient. The options are:

A: Close to either minus one or plus one. Hmm, no, because if DW is near 0, it's positive autocorrelation, so ρ should be near +1, not either.

C: Close to minus one. No, that's negative.

D: Close to zero. No, that would imply no autocorrelation, which would make DW around 2.

J: Close to plus one. Yes, that's what I thought.

Wait, but the formula I thought was DW ≈ 2(1 - ρ). So if DW is close to 0, 0 ≈ 2(1 - ρ) → 1 - ρ ≈ 0 → ρ ≈ 1. So yes, J.

Wait another thought: what if I'm mixing up the exact formula? Let me think again. The exact relationship is that for large samples, the DW statistic is approximately equal to 2(1 - ρ), where ρ is the first-order autocorrelation. So when ρ is 1, 2(1-1)=0, so DW is 0. When ρ is -1, 2(1 - (-1))=4, so DW would be 4.

So if DW is close to zero, ρ is close to 1. So the answer should be J, close to plus one.

The Durbin-Watson (DW) statistic is used to detect autocorrelation in the residuals of a regression analysis. It is approximately related to the first-order autocorrelation coefficient (ρ) by the formula:

\[
DW \approx 2(1 - \rho)
\]

When the DW statistic is close to zero, solving the equation \( 2(1 - \rho) \approx 0 \) gives \( \rho \approx 1 \). This indicates strong positive autocorrelation, as a ρ value close to +1 means successive residuals are highly correlated in the same direction.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. A DW close to zero specifically implies strong positive autocorrelation, not either positive or negative.
- **C**: Incorrect. A ρ close to -1 would correspond to a DW close to 4, not zero.
- **D**: Incorrect. A ρ close to zero would imply no autocorrelation, which corresponds to a DW close to 2.
- **J**: Correct. A DW close to zero indicates a ρ close to +1, reflecting strong positive autocorrelation.

Thus, when the DW statistic is close to zero, the first-order autocorrelation coefficient is close to +1.
