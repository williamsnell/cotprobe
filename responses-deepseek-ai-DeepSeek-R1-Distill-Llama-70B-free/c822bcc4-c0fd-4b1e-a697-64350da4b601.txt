Okay, so I have this economics question here about fiscal policy and its impact on real output in the short run. Hmm, I need to figure out when a change in government spending will have a greater effect. Let's break this down.

The question is asking about the factors that influence the effectiveness of government spending as a fiscal policy tool. I remember that fiscal policy works through government spending and taxation to influence aggregate demand. So, when the government increases spending, it should boost aggregate demand, which in turn affects real output.

I think about the multiplier effect here. The size of the multiplier determines how much real output changes in response to a change in spending. The formula for the multiplier, if I recall correctly, is 1 divided by (1 minus the marginal propensity to consume, or MPC). So, multiplier = 1/(1 - MPC). 

Wait, that's right. So if the MPC is higher, the denominator gets smaller, making the multiplier larger. That means each dollar of government spending leads to a bigger increase in aggregate demand because people spend a larger portion of additional income. Conversely, if MPC is low, the multiplier is smaller, so the effect is less pronounced.

Looking at the options, option D says the marginal propensity to consume is larger. That would mean a bigger multiplier, so a change in government spending would have a greater impact. That makes sense because if people spend more, the effect ripples through the economy more.

Option C is the opposite, where MPC is lower. That would result in a smaller multiplier, so the impact wouldn't be as great. So C is not the right answer.

Other options: Let's see. Option B says lower velocity of money. Velocity is about how often money is spent, but I'm not sure how that directly ties to government spending's impact. Maybe in monetary policy contexts, but here the focus is on fiscal policy, so maybe B isn't relevant here.

Option A is about expansionary fiscal policy. Well, whether the policy is expansionary or not, the question is about the magnitude of impact, not the direction. So whether it's expansionary or contractionary, the effect's size depends on the multiplier factors. So A might not be the right choice.

Options E, F, G: Exchange rate, trade balance, and inflation. These factors might affect the overall economy but aren't directly related to the size of the multiplier effect from government spending. For example, a higher exchange rate might affect net exports, but that's a different channel, not the direct impact of government spending on real output through the multiplier.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be D: the marginal propensity to consume is larger. Because a higher MPC leads to a larger multiplier, making the change in government spending have a greater short-run impact on real output.

A change in government spending will have a greater short-run impact on real output when the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is larger. This is because the MPC determines the size of the multiplier effect. The multiplier formula is:

\[
\text{Multiplier} = \frac{1}{1 - \text{MPC}}
\]

When the MPC is larger, the denominator decreases, making the multiplier larger. A larger multiplier means that each dollar of government spending leads to a greater increase in aggregate demand, as people spend a larger portion of additional income. This amplifies the impact of government spending on real output.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Whether fiscal policy is expansionary affects the direction of the impact, not its magnitude. This is irrelevant to the question.
- **B**: The velocity of money relates to monetary policy, not the direct impact of government spending on real output.
- **C**: A lower MPC would result in a smaller multiplier, reducing the impact of government spending.
- **D**: A larger MPC increases the multiplier, leading to a greater impact of government spending on real output. This is correct.
- **E, F, G**: Exchange rate, trade balance, and inflation rate are not directly related to the multiplier effect of government spending.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**D**
