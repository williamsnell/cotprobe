Okay, so I've got this physics problem about a heat pump and its coefficient of performance. Hmm, I remember that heat pumps are like refrigerators but in reverse, right? Instead of taking heat out of a system, they put heat into a system—like heating a house by taking heat from outside.

The problem gives me the COP as 7.0. Wait, COP can be defined in a couple of ways. Oh right, for a heat pump, COP is usually the heat delivered (q2) divided by the work done (w). But wait, the problem statement says COP is given as - (q1 / w). Oh wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me think.

Wait, the COP for a heat pump can be expressed as COP = q2 / w. But sometimes, in some contexts, especially when considering the definition in terms of the refrigerator, it's COP = q1 / w, where q1 is the heat extracted from the cold reservoir. But in a heat pump, the main goal is to deliver heat to the hot reservoir (the house), so the COP is q2/w.

But the question here says that COP is defined as -(q1/w) = T1/(T2 - T1). Wait, why the negative sign? Oh, right, because when you're considering the first law of thermodynamics, q1 is heat leaving the system (the cold reservoir), so maybe it's taken as negative. So COP here is (q1 / w) but with a negative sign, which would make sense if q1 is positive when heat is being pumped in.

Wait, maybe I'm getting this mixed up. Let me write down the formula. The COP as given is COP = -(q1/w) = T1/(T2 - T1) =7.0. Oh, so COP is both equal to -(q1/w) and T1/(T2-T1). And that's equal to 7.0.

Wait, no. Maybe the formula is COP = T1/(T2 - T1), right? Because I think the standard formula for COP of a heat pump is COP = T_hot / (T_hot - T_cold). Or wait, wait—no, for a refrigerator, COP is T_cold/(T_hot - T_cold). For heat pumps, which are just refrigerators in reverse, the COP is T_hot/(T_hot - T_cold). So in this case, T2 is the higher temperature, so COP = T2/(T2 - T1). But wait, the problem says COP is T1/(T2-T1) =7. So maybe I got it wrong.

Wait, maybe I should think again. The COP when the heat pump is operating is q2/w. Since the heat pump takes heat from the cold reservoir (q1) and dumps heat q2 into the hot reservoir, the first law says q2 = q1 + w. So q2 = q1 + w → q2/w = (q1/w) + 1.

But the problem says COP = - (q1/w) = [T1/(T2 - T1)] =7. So that would imply that -q1/w =7 → q1/w = -7. Hmm, but that can't be right because q1 is positive as heat taken from the cold reservoir, and work is positive when done on the system. Wait, maybe the signs are important here. Let me clarify.

In the case of a heat pump, the system absorbs heat q1 from the cold reservoir (outdoors), and releases heat q2 to the hot reservoir (house). The work w is done on the system. So the first law is q2 = q1 + w.

Then, COP (heat pump) is q2/w. So that's what we need to find in the problem—q2/w.

But according to the given COP, they say COP = -(q1/w) = T1/(T2-T1) =7. So from that, -(q1/w)=7 → q1/w = -7. But q1 is positive (heat taken from cold), w is positive (work done on system), so q1/w is positive. Hmm, that's a contradiction. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the definition.

Wait, perhaps the COP is given as (q2/w) = T2/(T2 - T1). Because that's the standard formula. Let me think. If T2 is the higher temperature, then T2 > T1, so denominator is positive. So for COP, if it's T2/(T2-T1), that's correct. But the problem says COP is T1/(T2-T1) =7. So using that, perhaps I can find T1/(T2-T1)=7 → T1 =7(T2-T1) → T1=7T2 -7T1 → 8T1=7T2 → T2= (8/7)T1.

Wait, but COP is supposed to be q2/w, which is also T2/(T2-T1). So let me compute that.

Given that T1/(T2-T1)=7 → T2-T1= T1/7 → T2= T1 + (T1)/7 = (8/7) T1.

Now, COP as q2/w is T2/(T2-T1) → (8/7 T1) / (T1/7) )= (8/7)/(1/7) )= 8/7 *7/1= 8.

Wait that's 8. So then q2/w would be 8. Looking at the options, option H is 8.0.

Wait but wait, let me double-check. Because if the COP is given as (q2/w)= T2/(T2-T1), and from the problem, the given COP is ( - q1/w )= T1/(T2-T1)=7. So:

So in this problem, they have COP defined as -q1/w = T1/(T2-T1)=7.

But normally, COP for heat pump is q2/w = T2/(T2-T1). So in this problem, we're given that the COP (as defined here) is 7, which equals T1/(T2-T1). So first, I can find T2 in terms of T1.

T1/(T2-T1) =7 → T2-T1 = T1/7 → T2 = T1 + T1/7 = (8 T1)/7.

Then, the actual COP as q2/w is T2/(T2-T1) = (8 T1/7) / (T1/7) ) → 8.

So the ratio q2/w is 8. So the answer should be H:8.0.

The problem involves a heat pump with a coefficient of performance (COP) defined as:

\[
\text{COP} = -\frac{q_1}{w} = \frac{T_1}{T_2 - T_1} = 7.0
\]

Here, \(q_1\) is the heat extracted from the cold reservoir (outdoors), \(w\) is the work done on the system, \(T_1\) is the temperature of the cold reservoir, and \(T_2\) is the temperature of the hot reservoir (house). The goal is to calculate the ratio \(\frac{q_2}{w}\), where \(q_2\) is the heat delivered to the hot reservoir.

### Key Analysis:
1. From the given definition of COP:
   \[
   \frac{T_1}{T_2 - T_1} = 7.0
   \]
   Rearranging:
   \[
   T_2 - T_1 = \frac{T_1}{7}
   \]
   \[
   T_2 = T_1 + \frac{T_1}{7} = \frac{8T_1}{7}
   \]

2. The standard definition of COP for a heat pump is:
   \[
   \text{COP} = \frac{q_2}{w} = \frac{T_2}{T_2 - T_1}
   \]
   Substituting \(T_2 = \frac{8T_1}{7}\) and \(T_2 - T_1 = \frac{T_1}{7}\):
   \[
   \frac{q_2}{w} = \frac{\frac{8T_1}{7}}{\frac{T_1}{7}} = 8
   \]

Thus, the ratio \(\frac{q_2}{w}\) is 8.0.

### Final Answer:
H: 8.0
