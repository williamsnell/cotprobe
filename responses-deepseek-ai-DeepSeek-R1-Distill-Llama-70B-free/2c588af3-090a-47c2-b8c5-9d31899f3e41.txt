Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it's about. The question is about finding the mole fraction of H2SO4 in a 7.0 molar solution. The solution has a density of 1.39 g/ml. Hmm, mole fraction, right.

Wait, mole fraction is the ratio of the moles of a component to the total moles in the solution. So for H2SO4, it would be moles of H2SO4 divided by (moles H2SO4 + moles water), I think.

The solution is 7.0 molar, which means 7.0 moles of H2SO4 per liter of solution. But wait, wait, molarity is moles per liter of solution, right. So the volume is 1 liter.

But to find mole fraction, I need to know the moles of both the solute and the solvent. The solvent here is water, I guess. So I need to find out how many moles of water are present.

Wait, but how do I find the moles of water? I know the density, which is 1.39 g/ml. So, for 1 liter of solution, what's the mass? Let me calculate that.

Density is mass/volume, so mass = density × volume. Volume is 1 liter, which is 1000 ml. So mass = 1.39 g/ml * 1000 ml = 1390 grams. So the solution has a mass of 1390 grams.

But this 1390 grams is the total mass of both H2SO4 and water. So I can find the mass of each component.

First, the moles of H2SO4: molarity is 7.0 mol/L, so 7.0 moles in 1 liter. The molar mass of H2SO4 is... let's see. H is 1, so 2*1=2. S is 32. O is 16 each, so 4*16=64. So 2 +32 +64 = 98 g/mol.

So mass of H2SO4 is moles × molar mass = 7.0 mol * 98 g/mol = 686 grams.

So the mass of water would be total mass minus mass of H2SO4. 1390 g - 686 g = 704 grams.

Now, the moles of water. Molar mass of H2O is 18 g/mol. So moles H2O = 704 g / 18 g/mol ≈ 39.11 moles.

So now, total moles in solution = moles H2SO4 + moles H2O = 7.0 + 39.11 ≈ 46.11 moles.

Mole fraction of H2SO4 is 7.0 / 46.11 ≈ 0.1518 or about 0.15.

Looking at the options, option C is 0.15. So the answer should be C.

To determine the mole fraction of H\(_2\)SO\(_4\) in a 7.0 molar solution with a density of 1.39 g/ml, we proceed as follows:

1. **Calculate the total mass of the solution**:  
   The solution has a density of 1.39 g/ml, and since 1 liter = 1000 ml, the total mass of the solution is:  
   \[
   \text{Mass} = \text{Density} \times \text{Volume} = 1.39 \, \text{g/ml} \times 1000 \, \text{ml} = 1390 \, \text{g}.
   \]

2. **Determine the mass of H\(_2\)SO\(_4\)**:  
   The molarity of the solution is 7.0 M, meaning there are 7.0 moles of H\(_2\)SO\(_4\) per liter of solution. The molar mass of H\(_2\)SO\(_4\) is:  
   \[
   \text{Molar mass of H}_2\text{SO}_4 = 2(1) + 32 + 4(16) = 98 \, \text{g/mol}.
   \]  
   Therefore, the mass of H\(_2\)SO\(_4\) is:  
   \[
   \text{Mass of H}_2\text{SO}_4 = 7.0 \, \text{mol} \times 98 \, \text{g/mol} = 686 \, \text{g}.
   \]

3. **Determine the mass of water (solvent)**:  
   The total mass of the solution is the sum of the masses of H\(_2\)SO\(_4\) and water. Thus, the mass of water is:  
   \[
   \text{Mass of water} = 1390 \, \text{g} - 686 \, \text{g} = 704 \, \text{g}.
   \]

4. **Calculate the moles of water**:  
   The molar mass of water is 18 g/mol. Therefore, the moles of water are:  
   \[
   \text{Moles of water} = \frac{\text{Mass of water}}{\text{Molar mass of water}} = \frac{704 \, \text{g}}{18 \, \text{g/mol}} \approx 39.11 \, \text{mol}.
   \]

5. **Calculate the mole fraction of H\(_2\)SO\(_4\)**:  
   The mole fraction is the ratio of the moles of H\(_2\)SO\(_4\) to the total moles in the solution:  
   \[
   \text{Mole fraction of H}_2\text{SO}_4 = \frac{\text{Moles of H}_2\text{SO}_4}{\text{Moles of H}_2\text{SO}_4 + \text{Moles of water}} = \frac{7.0}{7.0 + 39.11} \approx 0.1518.
   \]

   Rounding to two significant figures, the mole fraction is approximately 0.15.

Thus, the correct answer is **C: 0.15**.
