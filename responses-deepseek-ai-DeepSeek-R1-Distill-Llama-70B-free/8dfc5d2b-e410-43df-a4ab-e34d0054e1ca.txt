Question:

A state is the only state that imposes a tax on the extraction of pitchblende. This black-colored mineral consists of massive uraninite and contains radium, which is the chief ore-mineral source of uranium. Minute quantities of plutonium are also found in pitchblende. This is particularly significant because plutonium undergoes slow disintegration with the emission of a helium nucleus to form uranium 235, and that is fissionable with slow neutrons to yield atomic energy. As such, pitchblende is vital to the economy of the entire country. Congress has recently enacted a statute forbidding any state from imposing a tax on the extraction of pitchblende. Because pitchblende is not mined in any other state, this federal legislation affects only the state. Thus, in practice, this federal law only limits the taxing power of the state. In light of the Constitution and this federal law, the state extraction tax on pitchblende is most likely

Options:

A: valid, because Congress does not have the authority to interfere with the taxing policies of a state.
B: invalid, because the Constitution grants Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce, which includes the extraction of resources.
C: valid, because the state has the right to impose taxes on resources, regardless of federal legislation.
D: valid, because Congress does not have the power to regulate state taxation.
E: valid, because Congress may not enact a law that places one state on an unequal footing with other states.
F: invalid, because Congress has the power to regulate all forms of energy production.
G: invalid, because when Congress exercises its plenary power over interstate commerce, the supremacy clause voids inconsistent state action.
H: invalid, because Congress may use its general welfare power to prohibit state legislation that it deems harmful to the nation as a whole.
I: valid, because the state has the right to tax resources found within its borders.
J: invalid, because the state cannot tax a resource that is vital to the national economy.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about constitutional law, specifically dealing with the relationship between state taxation and federal power. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

The question is about whether a state's tax on extracting pitchblende is valid after Congress passed a law forbidding such a tax. Pitchblende is a mineral that's crucial for uranium, which is used in atomic energy. The state in question is the only one that imposes this tax, and Congress's new law only affects them.

I remember that under the Constitution, the federal government has certain powers that can override state laws, especially when it comes to interstate commerce or national interests. The Supremacy Clause comes into play here, which says federal law is the highest, so if there's a conflict, federal law wins.

Looking at the options:

Option A says the tax is valid because Congress can't interfere with state taxing policies. But wait, I think Congress does have the power to regulate things that affect interstate commerce. So if the extraction of pitchblende is part of a national or interstate commerce matter, Congress might have the authority to step in.

Option B suggests the tax is invalid because Congress can regulate interstate commerce, including resource extraction. That sounds plausible because even though the mineral is only mined in one state, it's part of a larger commerce stream, especially since it's vital for energy production which can have national implications.

Option C claims the state can impose taxes regardless of federal law. That doesn't seem right because the Supremacy Clause would make the federal law take precedence if it's within Congress's powers.

Option D argues Congress can't regulate state taxation. But I think when federal power is properly exercised, like under the Commerce Clause, they can affect state actions that interfere with that power.

Option E says the tax is valid because Congress can't single out a state. But I'm not sure about that. The law here applies to all states, but since only one state does it, the effect is on that state. I don't think that makes the federal law unconstitutional because it's not singling out; it's just that only one state is affected.

Option F says the tax is invalid because Congress controls energy production. I'm not certain about this. While energy can be part of interstate commerce, I'm not sure if Congress's power extends that directly unless tied to commerce.

Option G states the tax is invalid because of the Supremacy Clause and Congress's plenary power over interstate commerce. That makes sense. If Congress is acting within their commerce power, the state law must yield.

Option H claims Congress used the general welfare power to prohibit the tax. I don't think the general welfare clause typically allows Congress to prohibit state laws directly unless it's tied to spending or something else. So this might not be the right reasoning.

Option I says the state can tax resources within its borders. But if the federal law is based on a constitutional power, like commerce, then the state's right doesn't override it.

Option J argues the tax is invalid because the resource is vital to the national economy. That seems related to the Commerce Clause. If the resource affects national economic interests, Congress can regulate.

So putting it together, the key here is whether Congress has the authority to regulate the extraction of pitchblende under the Commerce Clause. Since pitchblende is used for uranium and energy, which are part of interstate commerce and national importance, Congress likely has the power. Therefore, the federal law would preempt the state tax.

Looking at the options, B and G seem the strongest. Option B says it's invalid under the Commerce Clause, and G says it's invalid because of the Supremacy Clause when Congress uses its commerce power. Both are similar, but G specifically mentions the Supremacy Clause and plenary power over commerce, which is a more precise reason.

Wait, but the question is about the validity of the state tax after the federal law. So if the federal law is constitutional, the state tax is invalid. So the correct answer would be either B or G.

Alternatively, thinking about relevant case law, like McCulloch v. Maryland, where the Supreme Court held that the federal government's powers, especially under the Necessary and Proper Clause, allow it to exercise authority that preempts state actions. Also, in cases where the state tax affects interstate commerce, the federal government can regulate.

So, the best answer seems to be G: invalid because Congress's exercise of interstate commerce power, coupled with the Supremacy Clause, voids the state's tax.

The question revolves around whether a state's tax on the extraction of pitchblende is valid after Congress enacted a law prohibiting such a tax. Pitchblende is a mineral critical for uranium production, which is vital for national energy and atomic energy. The analysis hinges on the Constitution's Supremacy Clause and Congress's powers, particularly under the Commerce Clause.

Key considerations include:

1. **Congress's Authority Under the Commerce Clause**: Congress has the power to regulate activities that substantially affect interstate commerce. Since pitchblende is essential for uranium and energy production, which have national implications, Congress likely has the authority to regulate its extraction.

2. **Supremacy Clause**: Federal law takes precedence over conflicting state laws when Congress acts within its constitutional powers. If Congress's prohibition on the tax is a valid exercise of its Commerce Clause power, the state tax must yield.

3. **Evaluation of Options**:
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. Congress can interfere with state taxing policies if it acts under a constitutional power like the Commerce Clause.
   - **Option B**: Plausible. Congress's regulation of interstate commerce includes resource extraction with national significance.
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. Federal law supersedes state law under the Supremacy Clause when Congress acts within its powers.
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. Congress can regulate state actions that interfere with its constitutional powers, such as interstate commerce.
   - **Option E**: Unlikely. The federal law applies uniformly, even if only one state is affected, so it does not single out the state unconstitutionally.
   - **Option F**: Less likely. While energy production may involve interstate commerce, this option does not directly tie Congress's action to the Commerce Clause.
   - **Option G**: Strongest. This option correctly identifies that Congress's plenary power over interstate commerce, combined with the Supremacy Clause, invalidates the state tax.
   - **Option H**: Incorrect. The general welfare power does not typically allow Congress to prohibit state laws directly unless tied to spending or other specific powers.
   - **Option I**: Incorrect. State taxing authority is secondary to federal law when Congress acts within its constitutional powers.
   - **Option J**: Plausible but less precise. While the resource's national importance is relevant, the correct reasoning is rooted in the Commerce Clause and Supremacy Clause.

The best answer is **Option G**, as it accurately reflects that the state tax is invalid because Congress's exercise of its interstate commerce power, coupled with the Supremacy Clause, preempts the state's action.

**Answer: G**
