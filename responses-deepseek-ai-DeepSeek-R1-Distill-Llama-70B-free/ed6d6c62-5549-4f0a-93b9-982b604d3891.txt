Okay, let's see. I've got this problem here about George Henderson's salary. Hmm, so he worked 46 hours last week. The question is about calculating his gross earnings. I remember that usually, the standard work week is 40 hours, and anything beyond that is considered overtime. Oh wait, the problem says the standard is 40 hours, so that's correct.

So George's pay has two parts: the base rate and overtime. The base rate is $3.00 per hour. But wait, for overtime, it's time and a half. Time and a half means you get 1.5 times your regular pay, right? So for any hours beyond 40, he gets 1.5 * 3 dollars.

Let me break it down. First, calculate the regular pay for 40 hours. That's 40 hours times $3.00 per hour. 40 * 3 is 120. So that's $120.00 for the regular hours.

Now, the overtime. He worked 46 hours in total. So subtract the 40 regular hours: 46 - 40 = 6 hours of overtime. For each of those 6 hours, he gets 1.5 times the base rate. So 6 * (3 * 1.5). Let me compute that. 3 times 1.5 is 4.5 dollars per hour for overtime. So 6 * 4.5 is... let me see, 6 times 4 is 24, and 6 times 0.5 is 3, so total 27. So the overtime pay is $27.00.

Now, add the regular pay and the overtime pay together. 120 + 27 is 147. So George's gross earnings should be $147.00.

Wait, let me double-check. 40 hours at $3 is 120, 6 hours at 4.5 is 27, total 147. Yep, that seems right. So looking at the options, option A is $147.00. So the answer should be A.

To calculate George Henderson's gross earnings, we break his pay into regular hours and overtime. The standard work week is 40 hours, and any hours beyond that are considered overtime. 

1. **Regular Pay**: George earns $3.00 per hour for the first 40 hours.  
   \[
   40 \, \text{hours} \times \$3.00/\text{hour} = \$120.00
   \]

2. **Overtime Pay**: For the 6 hours worked beyond 40, George earns time and a half, which is \(1.5 \times \$3.00 = \$4.50\) per hour.  
   \[
   6 \, \text{hours} \times \$4.50/\text{hour} = \$27.00
   \]

3. **Total Gross Earnings**: Add the regular pay and overtime pay together.  
   \[
   \$120.00 + \$27.00 = \$147.00
   \]

Thus, George's gross earnings last week were \$147.00. The correct answer is **A**.
