Answer:
    <think>


To determine the value of \( p \) in the equation \( 24 = 2p \), we can solve for \( p \) by isolating it on one side of the equation.

Starting with:
\[
24 = 2p
\]

Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for \( p \):
\[
\frac{24}{2} = \frac{2p}{2}
\]
\[
12 = p
\]

Thus, the value of \( p \) is 12.

From the given options:
- **A**: \( p = 24 \) → Incorrect
- **B**: \( p = 6 \) → Incorrect
- **C**: \( p = 14 \) → Incorrect
- **D**: \( p = 16 \) → Incorrect
- **E**: \( p = 8 \) → Incorrect
- **F**: \( p = 10 \) → Incorrect
- **G**: \( p = 18 \) → Incorrect
- **H**: \( p = 12 \) → Correct
- **I**: \( p = 20 \) → Incorrect
- **J**: \( p = 4 \) → Incorrect

The correct answer is **H**.
