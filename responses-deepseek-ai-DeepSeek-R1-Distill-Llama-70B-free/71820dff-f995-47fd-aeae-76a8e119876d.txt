Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal coalition and why it was electorally successful in the 1930s. I'm a bit rusty on my U.S. history, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking which option was a significant reason for the success of the New Deal coalition. The options are A to H, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that the New Deal was Roosevelt's response to the Great Depression. It included a bunch of programs and policies aimed at relief, recovery, and reform. The coalition that supported him was a big part of his electoral success, so I need to think about who was part of that coalition.

Option A: A strong anti-war stance during World War II. Wait, but the New Deal was in the 1930s, before the U.S. entered WWII. So this might not be relevant. Plus, the anti-war stance was more of an isolationist thing before Pearl Harbor, but I don't think that's tied directly to the New Deal's success.

Option B: Focus on mobilizing young voters. I'm not sure about this. I remember the New Deal had programs like the Civilian Conservation Corps which targeted young men, but was that a major reason for electoral success? Maybe, but I'm not certain. I think the coalition was broader than just young voters.

Option C: Commitment to ending racial segregation. Hmm, the New Deal did some things for African Americans, but I don't think it was about ending segregation. In fact, Roosevelt's administration had some issues with race, like not supporting anti-lynching laws as much as they could have. So this might not be accurate.

Option D: Major shift of African American voters from Republican to Democratic Party. Oh, right! I remember that African Americans traditionally voted Republican after the Civil War because of Abraham Lincoln. But during the Great Depression, many switched to the Democratic Party because of the New Deal's relief programs and Roosevelt's wife Eleanor's advocacy. So this shift was significant and contributed to the coalition's strength.

Option E: Endorsement of prominent business leaders. I think business leaders were actually pretty critical of the New Deal. Many saw it as too much government intervention and were against it. So this probably isn't correct.

Option F: Bipartisan approach to legislation. I'm not sure. While some Republicans might have supported parts of the New Deal, the main support was from Democrats. The coalition itself was more about bringing together various groups under the Democratic umbrella rather than being bipartisan.

Option G: Alliance with the Republican Party. No, that doesn't make sense. The New Deal was a Democratic initiative, so creating an alliance with the opposing party doesn't seem right.

Option H: Focus on reducing government intervention. That's the opposite of the New Deal. The New Deal was all about increasing government intervention to address the Depression, so this can't be correct.

Putting it all together, the most significant reason seems to be option D, the shift of African American voters to the Democratic Party. This shift was a key part of building the New Deal coalition, which included various groups like labor unions, farmers, and urban voters, and helped Roosevelt win elections.

The New Deal coalition's electoral success in the 1930s can be attributed to several factors, but one significant reason was the major shift of African American voters from the Republican to the Democratic Party. Historically, African Americans had supported the Republican Party since the Civil War, but the economic relief and social programs of the New Deal, along with advocacy from figures like Eleanor Roosevelt, drew them to the Democratic Party. This shift was crucial in strengthening the coalition and contributing to Roosevelt's electoral victories.

Answer: D
