Okay, so I've got this problem about the Cool Hand Luke Corporation using the dollar-value LIFO method. Hmm, I remember LIFO stands for Last-In, First-Out, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details of the dollar-value LIFO specifically. Let me think.

The question gives me the ending inventory for each year from 1969 to 1974 and the corresponding price-level indices. The base year is 1969 with an index of 100. I need to compute the current ending inventory cost for 1974 using dollar-value LIFO.

Wait, dollar-value LIFO adjusts the inventory costs for inflation, right? So each year, you calculate the real increase in inventory, adjusting for price changes. The method involves layers, where each year's layer is the change in inventory in real terms.

I think the process involves calculating the inventory in base year dollars and then converting them back using the price index. So each year, the change in inventory is multiplied by the current year's price index divided by the base year's index to get the LIFO cost.

Let me outline the steps to approach this:

1. **Understand the data:**
   The inventory and price indices from 1969 to 1974 are given. The base year is 1969, so the LIFO layers will be calculated relative to this.

2. **Calculate the change in inventory each year in base dollars.**
   For each year, the change is the current year's inventory minus the previous year's. But since we're using LIFO, we have to consider each year's contribution as a layer.

3. **Convert each year's inventory change into base year dollars.**
   Since the price index changes, each year's change is multiplied by (current index / base index). Wait, no, actually, to get the base year equivalent, you would divide by the current index. Wait, no, I'm getting confused here.

Wait, the formula for the LIFO value is typically the base inventory plus the sum of each year's (change in inventory) multiplied by (current year's index / base index). Or is it the other way around?

Wait, no. Let me think again. In dollar-value LIFO, each layer is the change in inventory (in current dollars) converted to base year dollars. So you take the change in inventory, which is in current dollars, and then divide by the current price index (relative to base) to get it into base year dollars. Then, when you sum all layers, you convert the total back to current dollars by multiplying by the current year's price index.

So the steps are:

- For each year, compute the change in inventory (current dollars).
- Convert each change to base year dollars by dividing by (current year's index / base index).
- Sum these base year dollar changes to get the total LIFO inventory in base dollars.
- Then, for the current year (1974), convert this total back to current dollars by multiplying by the 1974 index.

Wait, but I think I might have this reversed. Let me check with an example. Suppose in 1970, the price index is 96. So if I have an increase in inventory of $X in 1970 dollars, how much is that in 1969 dollars? It would be X / (96/100) = X * (100/96) ≈ X * 1.04167.

Wait, no, that can't be right because if prices are lower (index 96 < 100), then more units can be bought, so the dollar amount in base year would be higher. So yes, to get base year dollars, you divide by (current index / 100). Or equivalently, multiply by (100 / current index).

So for each year, the change in inventory (current dollars) is converted to base dollars by multiplying by (100 / price index).

So the formula for each layer is:

Layer = (Current Year Inventory - Previous Year Inventory) * (100 / Current Year Index)

Wait, but that's only if the current year's inventory is higher than the previous. If it's lower, you might have a negative layer, which would mean LIFO liquidation.

Wait, but in dollar-value LIFO, the layers are added when the inventory increases beyond previous levels, adjusting for inflation. So let's proceed.

The base year is 1969, with inventory $16,400. So that's the initial layer.

Then, for each subsequent year (1970 to 1974), calculate the change in inventory from the prior year.

Let me list the data:

Year    End Inventory ($)   Price Index
1969        16,400               100
1970        16,200               96
1971        20,900               104
1972        26,400               110
1973        24,035               115
1974        26,568               108

Wait, but in 1970, the inventory decreased from 1969. So the change is 16,200 - 16,400 = -200. So that's a negative change, which in LIFO might indicate a liquidation of a layer. But wait, in dollar-value LIFO, you don't subtract from the base layer. Instead, you can only add new layers when the inventory increases beyond previous levels in real terms.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The LIFO method values inventory at the prices of the most recent periods. In dollar-value LIFO, each layer is the incremental increase in inventory (in real terms) for each year, adjusted to base year dollars.

So each year, the change in real inventory is calculated and added as a layer.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the change in inventory for each year, convert it to base year dollars, and then if it's positive, add it as a new layer. If it's negative, subtract from the previous layers.

But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me try to compute each year step by step.

Starting with 1969: Inventory is $16,400. Since it's the base year, the LIFO cost is $16,400.

1970: End inventory is $16,200. So the change from 1969 is 16,200 - 16,400 = -200.

But in LIFO, a decrease would mean that we're liquidating part of the base layer. So the 1970 layer would be -200. But how does that translate into base year dollars?

Wait, but the price index for 1970 is 96. So to express this change in base year terms, we take the change (-200) and multiply by (100/96). So -200 * (100/96) ≈ -200 * 1.04167 ≈ -208.33.

Wait, but that would mean the layer is a negative value. So the LIFO inventory after 1970 would be 16,400 (base) + (-208.33) = 16,191.67 in base year dollars.

But wait, the actual ending inventory in 1970 is $16,200. Let me see if I'm doing this correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the real inventory levels each year in base dollars and see if each year's inventory exceeds the previous in real terms, thus adding a new layer.

Wait, another approach is:

Each year, compute the inventory in base year dollars. Then, compare to the previous year's base dollar inventory to see if there's an increase, which would form a new layer.

So:

- 1969: $16,400 / (100/100) = $16,400. Base layer.

- 1970: $16,200 / (96/100) = 16,200 * (100/96) ≈ 16,200 * 1.0416667 ≈ 16,875.

Wait, that's higher than 16,400. So the real inventory increased. So the change is 16,875 - 16,400 = 475. So layer for 1970 is +475. So total LIFO inventory in base dollars is 16,400 + 475 = 16,875.

Wait, but that's not matching with the initial thought. Because in 1970, the nominal inventory decreased, but in real terms, it increased because prices decreased.

Wait, maybe I'm confusing. Let me think: when prices decrease, the same nominal amount buys more in real terms. So when the price index decreases, the real inventory increases.

So, in 1970, the price index is 96, which is lower than 100. So $16,200 in 1970 is equivalent to $16,200 * (100/96) ≈ $16,875 in 1969 dollars.

Since this is higher than the 1969 base of $16,400, the company has added to its inventory in real terms. So this would create a new layer. The layer is the increase in real terms: 16,875 - 16,400 = 475.

So the LIFO cost after 1970 would be:

Base layer: 16,400 (from 1969)

Plus 1970 layer: 475

Total in base dollars: 16,875.

Then, in 1971, the nominal inventory is $20,900. The price index is 104.

So real inventory is 20,900 / (104/100) = 20,900 * (100/104) ≈ 20,900 * 0.9615 ≈ 20,096.15.

Compare to previous real inventory of 16,875. The change is 20,096.15 - 16,875 = 3,221.15. So this is a new layer in 1971.

Total LIFO in base dollars: 16,400 + 475 + 3,221.15 ≈ 20,096.15.

Wait, but wait: 16,400 + 475 is 16,875. Adding 3,221.15 gives 20,096.15. So that's correct.

In 1972: Nominal inventory is $26,400. Price index 110.

Real inventory: 26,400 / (110/100) = 26,400 * (100/110) ≈ 24,000.

Previous real inventory was 20,096.15, so the change is 24,000 - 20,096.15 ≈ 3,903.85. So another layer in 1972.

Total LIFO in base: 24,000.

1973: Nominal inventory is $24,035. Price index 115.

Real inventory: 24,035 / (115/100) = 24,035 * (100/115) ≈ 24,035 * 0.86957 ≈ 20,900.

Wait, previous real inventory was 24,000. So real inventory decreased. So this indicates a liquidation of a layer.

So the change is 20,900 - 24,000 = -3,100.

So the 1973 layer is -3,100. So total LIFO in base is 24,000 - 3,100 = 20,900.

Then, 1974: Nominal inventory is $26,568. Price index 108.

Real inventory: 26,568 / (108/100) = 26,568 * (100/108) ≈ 26,568 * 0.9259 ≈ 24,600.

Previous real inventory was 20,900. So change is 24,600 - 20,900 = 3,700. So this is a new layer in 1974.

So the total LIFO in base dollars is 20,900 + 3,700 = 24,600.

Wait, but how does this relate to the current cost? Because we're to compute the 1974 ending inventory in dollar-value LIFO cost.

Wait, no. Because in dollar-value LIFO, the total layers in base dollars are then converted back to current dollars using the current year's price index.

Wait, no, the total LIFO inventory is the sum of all layers in base dollars, and then multiplied by the current price index to get the current dollar LIFO value.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Alternatively, each layer is in base dollars, and when calculating the LIFO cost, each layer is multiplied by the current price index.

Alternatively, perhaps each layer is kept in base dollars, and the total is the sum of all layers, which is then multiplied by the current price index to get the current LIFO value.

Wait, but in this case, the total LIFO in base dollars after 1974 is 24,600. So to get the current dollar amount (1974 dollars), multiply by (108/100) → 24,600 * 1.08 = 26,568.

Wait, but that's the same as the nominal inventory. That can't be right because the options don't have that. Or wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake.

Wait, another approach: Each layer is the change in real inventory, and to get the current LIFO cost, each layer is multiplied by the current price index.

So let me list each layer with its year and the price index when it was added.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try another way.

Compute the real inventory each year and track the layers.

1969: Real = 16,400 (base layer).

1970: Real = 16,875. So layer = 475 (16,875 - 16,400). This layer is valued at 1970 prices, but in base dollars.

Wait, no. The layers are all in base dollars, and when you want to express the total inventory in current dollars, you multiply the total base layers by the current price index.

So after each year, you add the layers in base dollars, and then the total is multiplied by the current year's index to get the LIFO cost.

Wait, so in 1974, the total base layers are 24,600 (as calculated earlier). Multiply that by the 1974 price index of 108 → 24,600 * 108 / 100 = 24,600 * 1.08 = 26,568.

But wait, that's the same as the nominal inventory of 1974, which is $26,568. So that would suggest that the LIFO cost is the same as the current cost, but that can't be right because in 1973, there was a liquidation.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Let me try another approach.

Alternatively, each layer is converted to current dollars at the time of the layer. Then, the total LIFO cost is the sum of all layers converted to current dollars.

Wait, perhaps the layers are as follows:

1969: $16,400 (base layer, in 1969 dollars). To get current (1974) dollars, multiply by (108/100) → 16,400 * 1.08 = 17,712.

1970: The layer in base dollars is 475. So in 1974 dollars, 475 * 1.08 = 513.

1971: Layer is 3,221.15. In 1974: 3,221.15 * 1.08 ≈ 3,477.04.

1972: Layer is 3,903.85. In 1974: 3,903.85 * 1.08 ≈ 4,215.15.

1973: Layer is -3,100. So in 1974: -3,100 * 1.08 = -3,348.

1974: Layer is 3,700. Since it's the current year, it's already in 1974 dollars? Or wait, no. The layer is in base dollars, so 3,700 * 1.08 = 3,996.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me try to compute each layer's value in 1974 dollars.

Wait, perhaps each layer is multiplied by the current year's index over the layer's year index. Hmm, no, that might not be right.

Wait, another approach: The layers in base dollars are as follows:

- 1969: 16,400
- 1970: +475
- 1971: +3,221.15
- 1972: +3,903.85
- 1973: -3,100
- 1974: +3,700

Wait, but in 1973, the real inventory decreased, so the layer is negative, meaning we're using up part of the previous layers.

Wait, but in LIFO, you can't go below the base layer. So perhaps the 1973 layer reduces the total layers, but not below the base.

Wait, perhaps I should sum all the layers:

16,400 + 475 + 3,221.15 + 3,903.85 - 3,100 + 3,700.

Let me compute that step by step.

16,400 + 475 = 16,875

16,875 + 3,221.15 = 20,096.15

20,096.15 + 3,903.85 = 24,000

24,000 -3,100 = 20,900

20,900 +3,700 = 24,600.

So the total layers in base dollars sum up to 24,600.

Now, to get the LIFO cost in 1974 dollars, I multiply this by the 1974 price index (108) divided by the base index (100).

So 24,600 * (108/100) = 24,600 * 1.08 = 26,568.

Wait, but that's the same as the given 1974 ending inventory. So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, but the question is asking to change the current ending inventory cost to dollar-value LIFO. So perhaps the current cost is the 1974 nominal inventory, and we have to compute what the LIFO value would be, which in this case is 26,568. But that's the same as the current cost. But that doesn't make sense because in 1973, the real inventory decreased, leading to a lower LIFO cost.

Wait, maybe I'm making a mistake in the way I'm calculating the layers. Let me try a different approach.

The correct formula for dollar-value LIFO is:

LIFO Inventory = Base Inventory * (Current Index / Base Index) + sum over each year [(Change in Real Inventory) * (Current Index / Base Index)]

Wait, no, that's not right. Another source I recall says that each layer is converted to the current year's dollars.

Wait, perhaps I should compute each layer in the year it was added and then adjust each layer to current year's dollars.

Let me try that.

Compute each layer as the change in real inventory (base year dollars) for each year, then multiply each layer by the 1974 price index to get their 1974 dollar values.

Wait, let me attempt that:

1969 Layer:

Change in real inventory: 16,400 (since it's the base year).

1970 Layer:

Change in real inventory: 475.

1971 Layer: 3,221.15

1972 Layer: 3,903.85

1973 Layer: -3,100

1974 Layer:
