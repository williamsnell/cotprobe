Alright, so I have this problem about Brownian motion, and I'm supposed to find the conditional probability density function (PDF) of W(s) given W(t) and then determine the mean and variance. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that a standard Brownian motion, W(t), has some key properties. It starts at zero, has independent increments, and each increment is normally distributed. Also, for any times t and s where t > s, W(t) - W(s) is independent of W(s).

The problem states that 0 < s < t. Here, s is 1/2 and t is 1. So we're looking at W(1/2) given that W(1) = 2.

I think I need to model this as a conditional distribution. Since Brownian motion is Gaussian, the conditional distribution should also be normal. So the conditional PDF of W(s) given W(t) should be a normal distribution with some mean and variance that I need to find.

Let me denote W(s) as X and W(t) as Y for simplicity. So we have X = W(1/2) and Y = W(1). We're looking for the distribution of X given Y=2.

I remember that for jointly normal variables, the conditional distribution is given by:

E[X | Y = y] = E[X] + Cov(X, Y) * (y - E[Y]) / Var(Y)

And the variance is:

Var(X | Y = y) = Var(X) - Cov(X, Y)^2 / Var(Y)

Wait, no, I think I might have that mixed up. Let me think again. Oh right, the formula for the conditional variance is Var(X) - [Cov(X,Y)]Â² / Var(Y). But wait, no, that's for the variance of the estimator in regression. Maybe I should think in terms of the properties of Brownian motion.

Alternatively, since W(t) is a Gaussian process, we can model W(s) and W(t) as jointly normal variables. Their covariance is the minimum of their times. So Cov(W(s), W(t)) = s, because s < t.

The variance of W(s) is s, and the variance of W(t) is t. So Var(X) = s = 1/2, Var(Y) = t = 1. The covariance Cov(X,Y) = s, which is 1/2.

So for the conditional expectation E[X | Y = y], it's E[X] + Cov(X,Y)/(Var(Y)) * (y - E[Y]).

But since Brownian motion has mean zero, E[X] = 0 and E[Y] = 0. So this simplifies to (Cov(X,Y)/Var(Y)) * y.

Plugging in the numbers, Cov(X,Y) is 1/2, Var(Y) is 1. So E[X|Y=2] = (1/2 / 1) * 2 = 1.

Wait, that's 1. So the mean is 1.0.

Wait, but let me double-check. Alternatively, I remember that in Brownian motion, given W(t) = a, the conditional distribution of W(s) is normal with mean (s/t) * a and variance s(1 - s/t). Because the increments are independent, so knowing W(t) constrains W(s) proportionally.

So applying that formula, here s = 1/2, t=1, a=2. So the mean is (1/2 /1)*2 = 1. The variance is (1/2)*(1 - (1/2)/1) = (1/2)*(1 - 1/2) = (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4.

So that would give a mean of 1 and variance 1/4. Looking at the options, option J is [1, 0.25], which matches this.

Wait, but I should make sure I'm not mixing up the formulas. Another approach: Since W(t) = W(s) + (W(t) - W(s)). The increment from s to t, which is W(t) - W(s), is independent of W(s), and has variance (t - s) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

So given that W(t) = 2, we can write W(s) + (W(t) - W(s)) = 2. Let me denote Z = W(t) - W(s), which is N(0, 0.5) and independent of W(s). So W(s) = 2 - Z.

But since Z is independent, the distribution of W(s) given W(t)=2 would be... Wait, no, because W(s) is part of the equation. Alternatively, perhaps using the joint distribution.

Let me think again. The joint distribution of W(s) and W(t) is a bivariate normal with mean vector (0,0), and covariance matrix:

Var(W(s)) = s = 0.5,

Var(W(t)) = t = 1,

Cov(W(s), W(t)) = s = 0.5.

So the covariance matrix is:

[ 0.5    0.5 ]

[ 0.5    1 ]

The conditional distribution of W(s) given W(t) = y is normal with:

Mean = E[W(s)|W(t)=y] = (Cov(W(s), W(t)) / Var(W(t))) * y

Which is (0.5 / 1) * y = 0.5 y.

In our case, y=2, so mean is 0.5 * 2 = 1.

The variance is Var(W(s)) - (Cov(W(s), W(t)))^2 / Var(W(t)) = 0.5 - (0.5)^2 / 1 = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25.

So the mean is 1, variance is 0.25. Looking back at the options, option J is [1.0, 0.25], which matches.

So the answer should be option J.

To solve the problem, we need to find the conditional PDF of \( W(s = 1/2) \) given \( W(t = 1) = 2 \) for a standard Brownian motion \( W(t) \). Since Brownian motion is a Gaussian process, the conditional distribution will also be normal. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Properties of Brownian Motion**:  
   - \( W(s) \) and \( W(t) \) are jointly normal with mean vector \((0, 0)\).  
   - \( \text{Var}(W(s)) = s = 0.5 \), \( \text{Var}(W(t)) = t = 1 \), and \( \text{Cov}(W(s), W(t)) = \min(s, t) = s = 0.5 \).  

2. **Conditional Mean**:  
   The conditional mean of \( W(s) \) given \( W(t) = 2 \) is:  
   \[
   E[W(s) | W(t) = 2] = \frac{\text{Cov}(W(s), W(t))}{\text{Var}(W(t))} \cdot 2 = \frac{0.5}{1} \cdot 2 = 1.
   \]

3. **Conditional Variance**:  
   The conditional variance of \( W(s) \) given \( W(t) = 2 \) is:  
   \[
   \text{Var}(W(s) | W(t) = 2) = \text{Var}(W(s)) - \frac{\text{Cov}(W(s), W(t))^2}{\text{Var}(W(t))} = 0.5 - \frac{(0.5)^2}{1} = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25.
   \]

Thus, the conditional distribution of \( W(s = 1/2) \) given \( W(t = 1) = 2 \) is normal with mean \( 1.0 \) and variance \( 0.25 \). Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**[1.0, 0.25]**
