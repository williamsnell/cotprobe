Okay, so I have this finance problem in front of me, and I need to figure out how much I need to invest in these bonds to get a certain annual income from interest. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

The question says: How much must be invested in $1,000 5% bonds to have an annual income from interest of $3,000 if the bonds sell at 74(7/8)? There's also a brokerage fee of $5 per bond. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the right one.

Alright, let's start by understanding each part of the problem.

First, the bonds are $1,000 each, and they have a 5% interest rate. So each bond pays 5% of $1,000 annually. Let me calculate that. 5% of 1,000 is 50 dollars. So each bond gives $50 a year in interest.

Now, the goal is to have an annual income of $3,000 from the interest. So I need to find out how many bonds I need to buy so that their total interest equals $3,000. 

If each bond gives $50, then the number of bonds needed would be 3000 divided by 50. Let me do that math: 3000 / 50 = 60. So I need 60 bonds.

Wait, but I also have to consider the cost of each bond. The bonds are selling at 74(7/8). Hmm, I remember that bond prices can be a bit tricky. 74(7/8) is the same as 74.875, right? Because 7/8 of a dollar is 0.875. So each bond is priced at $74.875 per $100 of face value? Or wait, wait. Wait, wait, no, the bond is $1,000 face value, so the price is 74.875% of $1,000. So the cost per bond is 74.875 multiplied by $1,000, but wait, no, that's not right. Wait, no, the price is 74.875 dollars per 100 dollars of face value. Oh wait, no, that's not correct either.

Wait, let me clarify. Bonds are usually quoted as a percentage of their face value. So if a bond with a face value of $1,000 is selling at 74.875, that means you're paying 74.875% of $1,000 for each bond. So 74.875% of $1,000 is 748.75 dollars per bond. So each bond costs $748.75.

Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Because 74.875 as a price would be per $100 face value, so for a $1,000 face value, it's 74.875 times 10, which is 748.75 dollars. Yes, that's correct. So each bond costs $748.75.

But wait, there's also a brokerage fee of $5 per bond. So each bond's total cost is 748.75 + 5 = $753.75.

Now, I need to buy 60 bonds. So the total investment would be 60 multiplied by 753.75.

Let me calculate that. 60 times 700 is 42,000. 60 times 53.75 is 60 * 50 = 3,000, 60 * 3.75 = 225. So 3,000 + 225 = 3,225. So total is 42,000 + 3,225 = 45,225.

Looking at the options, option C is $45,225. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations. Each bond's price is 74.875% of $1,000, which is 748.75. Plus $5 fee makes it 753.75 per bond. 60 bonds would cost 60 * 753.75. Let me compute 753.75 * 60. 

753.75 * 60: Let me break it down. 700 * 60 = 42,000. 50*60=3,000, 3.75*60=225. So 42,000 + 3,000 = 45,000, plus 225 makes 45,225. Yep, that's correct.

So the correct answer is C: $45,225.

To determine how much must be invested in $1,000 5% bonds to achieve an annual interest income of $3,000, we proceed as follows:

1. **Interest per bond**: Each bond has a face value of $1,000 and a 5% annual interest rate. Thus, the interest per bond is:  
   \[
   \$1,000 \times 5\% = \$50 \text{ per bond annually.}
   \]

2. **Number of bonds needed**: To achieve an annual interest income of $3,000, the number of bonds required is:  
   \[
   \frac{\$3,000}{\$50} = 60 \text{ bonds.}
   \]

3. **Price per bond**: The bonds are selling at 74(7/8), which is equivalent to 74.875% of their face value. For a $1,000 bond, the price is:  
   \[
   \$1,000 \times 74.875\% = \$748.75.
   \]

4. **Total cost per bond**: Including the brokerage fee of $5 per bond, the total cost per bond becomes:  
   \[
   \$748.75 + \$5 = \$753.75.
   \]

5. **Total investment**: For 60 bonds, the total investment is:  
   \[
   60 \times \$753.75 = \$45,225.
   \]

Thus, the total amount that must be invested is **$45,225**, which corresponds to option **C**.
