Question:

Which of the following statements is NOT correct about apoptosis?

Options:

A: Apoptosis, a special type of cell division, requires multiple cell signaling.
B: The fact that apoptosis is widespread across several kingdoms is evidence that it evolved early in the evolution of eukaryotes.
C: Apoptosis plays a crucial role in the development of fingers in embryonic development.
D: Apoptosis prevents an aging and dying cell from damaging neighboring cells.

Okay, so I've got this question about apoptosis, and I need to figure out which statement is incorrect. Let me think about what I remember about apoptosis.

Apoptosis is programmed cell death, right? It's a process where cells die in a controlled manner. I remember it's important for development and maintaining health. For example, in embryos, apoptosis helps shape structures. Oh, like when fingers form—between the fingers, the tissue dies so the fingers separate. So option C says apoptosis is crucial for finger development, which sounds correct.

Option D: Apoptosis prevents aging or dying cells from harming neighbors. That makes sense because if a cell is damaged or old, it can become harmful, maybe even cancerous. Apoptosis removes them, so D seems correct.

Option B says apoptosis is widespread across kingdoms and that suggests it evolved early in eukaryotes. Hmm, I thought apoptosis is a eukaryotic process. Prokaryotes don't do apoptosis as far as I know. But wait, the question says 'kingdoms'—like fungi, plants, animals. So if it's in many eukaryotic kingdoms, it's probably an ancient trait. So B sounds correct.

Option A: Apoptosis is a special type of cell division requiring multiple signals. Wait, apoptosis is cell death, not division. Cell division is mitosis or meiosis. So A is incorrect because it's calling apoptosis a type of cell division. That can't be right. Cell signaling is involved, but it's about cell death, not division.

Apoptosis is a process of programmed cell death, not cell division. It plays a crucial role in development, such as the formation of fingers during embryonic development (C is correct). It also prevents damaged or aging cells from harming neighboring cells (D is correct). The widespread presence of apoptosis across eukaryotic kingdoms suggests it evolved early (B is correct). However, apoptosis is not a type of cell division, making option A incorrect.

Answer: A
