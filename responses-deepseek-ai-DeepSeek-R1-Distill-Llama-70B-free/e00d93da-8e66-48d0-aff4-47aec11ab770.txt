The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A 2.0 L flask holds 0.40 g of helium gas. If the helium is evacuated into a larger container while the temperature is held constant, what will the effect on the entropy of the helium be?

Options:

A: It will increase as the gas molecules will be more dispersed in the larger flask.
B: It will remain constant as the helium is simply transferred to a larger container.
C: It will remain constant because the volume of the flask does not affect entropy.
D: It will remain constant as the number of helium molecules does not change.
E: It will increase as the temperature is held constant.
F: It will decrease as the pressure of the gas will decrease in the larger flask.
G: It will decrease as there will be fewer collisions between the helium molecules in the larger flask.
H: It will decrease as the gas will be more ordered in the larger flask.
I: It will decrease because the molecules will collide with the sides of the larger flask less often than they did in the smaller flask.
J: It will increase because the molecules will collide with the sides of the larger flask more often than they did in the smaller flask.

Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics question here about entropy when helium gas is moved to a larger container. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down.

The question says: A 2.0 L flask holds 0.40 g of helium. The helium is evacuated into a larger container while keeping the temperature constant. What happens to the entropy of the helium?

Hmm, I remember that entropy is a measure of disorder in a system. So when a gas expands into a larger volume, the molecules have more space to move around, which should increase the disorder. But wait, let me think about the variables involved here.

The process is isothermal, so the temperature doesn't change. For an ideal gas, when temperature is constant, the change in entropy can be calculated using the formula ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1), where V2 is the larger volume. Since V2 > V1, ln(V2/V1) is positive, so entropy increases.

Wait, but I should make sure. The formula for entropy change when volume changes is ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1) when temperature is constant. So as the volume increases, entropy increases. That makes sense because the gas molecules are more dispersed, leading to higher entropy.

But let me look at the options. Option A says entropy increases because the gas is more dispersed. That aligns with what I was thinking. Option B says it remains constant because it's just moved. But no, because volume change affects entropy even if it's the same amount of gas.

Option E says entropy increases because temperature is constant. Wait, temperature being constant is a condition, but the reason is the volume increase, not the temperature. So E might not be the best choice.

Options F, G, H, I, J are about pressure, collisions, order. I think those are distractors. For example, when volume increases, pressure decreases, but that's a side effect. The main thing is the volume increase leading to more possible microstates, hence higher entropy.

So yes, the correct answer should be A. Because moving the gas to a larger container increases the volume, which increases entropy as the molecules are more dispersed.

When helium gas is transferred from a 2.0 L flask to a larger container under isothermal conditions, the entropy of the helium increases. This is because entropy is a measure of disorder, and as the gas expands into a larger volume, the molecules become more dispersed, occupying a greater number of available microstates. The formula for entropy change, ΔS = nR ln(V2/V1), confirms this: since V2 > V1, the logarithmic term is positive, leading to an increase in entropy.

Analyzing the options:

- **A** correctly states that entropy increases due to the gas molecules being more dispersed in the larger container.
- **B, C, D** incorrectly claim entropy remains constant, which is not true because entropy depends on volume when temperature is constant.
- **E** mentions temperature being constant but does not address the volume change, making it less precise.
- **F, G, H, I, J** focus on pressure or collisions, which are secondary effects and not the primary reason for the entropy change.

Thus, the correct answer is **A**.
