Question:

One aspect of Marxian economics is that some of the pre-dictions of Marx were proven wrong. As a result of this, some radical economists have only adopted the tools of Marxian analysis, without necessarily accepting Marx's con-clusions . In the nineteenth century, other Marxists became 'revisionists'. Explain briefly what distinguishes a re-visionist from a Marxist.

Options:

A: Revisionists maintain that capitalism will naturally evolve into socialism without any intervention
B: Revisionists support the idea of a permanent dictatorship of the proletariat as the path to socialism
C: Revisionists focus on individual enlightenment and moral reform as the means to achieve socialism
D: Revisionists argue for immediate abolition of the state to achieve socialism
E: Revisionists believe in gradual evolution towards socialism through political action and trade unionism, rejecting violent class struggle.
F: Revisionists emphasize the importance of international trade as a primary tool for achieving socialism
G: Revisionists adhere strictly to Marx's labor theory of value
H: Revisionists reject the concept of class struggle entirely and believe in maintaining the status quo
I: Revisionists fully accept Marx's theories and predictions
J: Revisionists believe in achieving socialism through violent revolution

Okay, so I've got this question about Marxian economics and revisionists versus Marxists. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through.

The question says that some radical economists use Marxian tools but don't accept all his conclusions. Then it mentions 19th-century Marxists who became revisionists, and asks what distinguishes a revisionist from a Marxist.

From what I remember, Marx's original ideas included the idea of a proletarian revolution, where the working class would rise up and overthrow the capitalist system, leading to a socialist society and eventually communism. So Marxists would support this idea of a violent or revolutionary change.

But then there were people like Eduard Bernstein, right? He was a Marxist theorist who proposed some changes to Marx's ideas, which made him a revisionist. Bernstein thought that socialism could be achieved through gradual, peaceful means rather than revolution. He believed in working within the existing political system, using democratic methods, trade unions, and political action to bring about change. So revisionists don't think a violent revolution is necessary.

Looking at the options now:

Option A: Revisionists think capitalism evolves into socialism naturally. Hmm, that sounds a bit like what Bernstein said, but I think he emphasized the need for political action, not just natural evolution. So maybe this isn't the best fit.

Option B: Supports permanent dictatorship of the proletariat. That doesn't sound right because I think that's more aligned with Marxist-Leninist ideas, not revisionists. Revisionists probably reject that.

Option C: Focus on individual enlightenment and moral reform. I don't recall revisionists focusing on that. That sounds more like utopian socialism, not revisionism.

Option D: Abolish the state immediately. That's more anarchist or maybe Marxist (since Marx said the state would wither away), but I think revisionists didn't push for immediate state abolition.

Option E: Gradual evolution through political action and trade unionism, rejecting violent struggle. This fits with Bernstein's ideas. So E seems correct.

Option F: International trade as a tool. Not sure about that. I don't think that's the main point of revisionism.

Option G: Strictly adhere to Marx's labor theory. Revisionists probably deviated from some of Marx's theories, so G is unlikely.

Option H: Reject class struggle. No, revisionists still believed in class struggle but thought it could be resolved through peaceful means, so H is wrong.

Option I: Fully accept Marx's theories. No, revisionists are the ones who revised, so I is incorrect.

Option J: Achieve through violent revolution. That's the opposite; revisionists didn't support that, so J is wrong.

So, putting it all together, the correct answer should be E.

The correct answer is:

E: Revisionists believe in gradual evolution towards socialism through political action and trade unionism, rejecting violent class struggle.

This choice aligns with the ideas of figures like Eduard Bernstein, who advocated for peaceful, democratic means to achieve socialism rather than a violent revolution. 

Answer: E
