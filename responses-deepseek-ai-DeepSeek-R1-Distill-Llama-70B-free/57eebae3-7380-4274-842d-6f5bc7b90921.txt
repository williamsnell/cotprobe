Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Discuss the role of a stimulus that elicits a behavior pattern.

Options:

A: Stimuli can only elicit a response if they are intense
B: Stimuli intensity directly affects the animal's motivation
C: Stimuli have no influence on an animal's behavior
D: Stimuli serve as a universal language, eliciting the same behavior patterns across different species.
E: Stimuli, referred to as sign stimuli, elicit specific responses from an animal. The intensity of the stimuli necessary to evoke a behavior pattern is inversely proportional to the animal's motivation to perform that behavior.
F: Stimuli are only effective if they are novel and unfamiliar to the animal.
G: Stimuli that elicit behavior patterns are only visual; other sensory modalities do not trigger responses.
H: Stimuli are passive elements in the environment and require the animal to interpret them before eliciting a behavior pattern.
I: The animal's motivation to perform a behavior has no impact on how stimuli affect behavior patterns.
J: Stimuli must be paired with a reward to elicit any behavior pattern.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this multiple-choice question about the role of a stimulus in eliciting a behavior pattern. Let's break it down step by step.

The question is asking about the role of a stimulus. I remember that stimuli are things in the environment that can cause a reaction or response. In the context of animal behavior, I think about how certain signals or cues make animals do specific things.

Looking at the options, I'll go through each one to see which makes the most sense.

Option A says stimuli can only elicit a response if they are intense. Hmm, that doesn't sound right. I remember learning about something called sign stimuli, which are specific cues that trigger a response. Intensity might matter, but I don't think it's the only factor. So A might not be correct.

Option B states that the intensity of stimuli directly affects the animal's motivation. Wait, I think it's actually the other way around. If an animal is highly motivated, maybe a less intense stimulus is needed. So maybe B is incorrect because it says intensity directly affects motivation, not the other way.

Option C claims that stimuli have no influence on behavior. That can't be right because without stimuli, many behaviors wouldn't happen. Like, a bird won't build a nest without some trigger, so C is probably wrong.

Option D suggests stimuli are universal across species. No, that doesn't make sense. Different species have different behaviors triggered by different things. For example, a red belly in a stickleback fish signals aggression, but that wouldn't mean the same to another species. So D is incorrect.

Option E says stimuli, called sign stimuli, elicit specific responses. It also mentions that the intensity needed is inversely proportional to the animal's motivation. Oh wait, I remember this concept. A sign stimulus is a specific cue that triggers a behavior. And if the animal is really motivated, even a weak stimulus might be enough. So if motivation is high, less intense stimulus is needed. That matches what E is saying. This sounds correct.

Option F says stimuli must be novel. I don't think that's true. Animals can respond to familiar stimuli repeatedly. Like a dog hearing its owner call every day. So F is wrong.

Option G claims that only visual stimuli work. No, animals use all kinds of senses. For example, sounds, smells, touch, etc., all can trigger behaviors. So G is incorrect.

Option H states that stimuli are passive and require interpretation. Well, yes, the animal does need to perceive and interpret the stimulus. But I'm not sure if this is the best answer compared to E, which directly addresses the relationship between stimulus intensity and motivation.

Option I says motivation doesn't affect how stimuli influence behavior. That's the opposite of what I think. Motivation does play a role. If an animal is more motivated, the stimulus doesn't need to be as strong. So I is wrong.

Option J claims that stimuli must be paired with a reward. That's more about learning and conditioning, like Pavlov's dogs. But not all stimuli require a reward; some are innate. Like a bird building a nest doesn't need a reward to respond to the stimulus. So J is incorrect.

So putting it all together, the correct answer seems to be E. It correctly describes sign stimuli and the inverse relationship between stimulus intensity and the animal's motivation.

The correct answer is E. Stimuli, referred to as sign stimuli, elicit specific responses from an animal. The intensity of the stimuli necessary to evoke a behavior pattern is inversely proportional to the animal's motivation to perform that behavior.
