Question:

The molar absorptivity of phytochome (a light-sensitive pigment thought to control the process of flowering in plants) is 76,000. What will be the absorbance of a 5.0 × 10^-6 molar aqueous solution of phytochome if the pathlength of the cell is 1.0 cm?

Options:

A: 0.76
B: 1.90
C: 0.0076
D: 0.57
E: 0.19
F: 1.52
G: 7.60
H: 0.38
I: 3.04
J: 0.095

Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the absorbance of a phytochrome solution. Hmm, I remember that absorbance is related to molar absorptivity, concentration, and path length. Oh right, Beer-Lambert Law! The formula is A = ε * c * l, right?

Wait, let me make sure I have the variables right. ε is the molar absorptivity, which is given as 76,000. The concentration c is 5.0 × 10^-6 molar. And the path length l is 1.0 cm. Oh wait, but sometimes I've seen the formula with l in meters, but I think in this case, since it's cm, we don't need to convert because the units should work out as is.

So plugging the numbers in: A = 76,000 * 5.0e-6 * 1.0. Let me calculate that. 76,000 times 5e-6. Let's see, 76,000 is 7.6e4. So 7.6e4 *5e-6 = (7.6 *5) * (1e4 * 1e-6) = 38 * 1e-2. Because 1e4 *1e-6 is 1e-2. So 38 * 0.01 is 0.38. Then multiply by the path length, which is 1, so it stays 0.38.

Looking at the options, option H is 0.38. So the answer should be H. But wait, let me double-check my calculations to be safe. 76,000 times 5e-6 is 0.38. Yep, that's correct. So I think H is the right choice.

To calculate the absorbance of the phytochrome solution, we use the Beer-Lambert Law: 

\[
A = \varepsilon \cdot c \cdot l
\]

Where:
- \(\varepsilon = 76,000 \, \text{M}^{-1}\text{cm}^{-1}\) (molar absorptivity),
- \(c = 5.0 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{M}\) (concentration),
- \(l = 1.0 \, \text{cm}\) (path length).

Substituting the values:

\[
A = 76,000 \cdot 5.0 \times 10^{-6} \cdot 1.0
\]

First, calculate \(76,000 \cdot 5.0 \times 10^{-6}\):

\[
76,000 = 7.6 \times 10^4, \quad 7.6 \times 10^4 \cdot 5.0 \times 10^{-6} = 38 \times 10^{-2} = 0.38
\]

Thus, \(A = 0.38\). Comparing this result with the options, the correct answer is:

**H: 0.38**
