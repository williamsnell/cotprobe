Question:

A 50-year-old woman comes to the office for the first time because of recurrent abdominal pain. Review of her extensive medical chart, which she has brought with her, discloses that she has a long history of varying physical symptoms. Definitive causes for these symptoms have not been found despite extensive diagnostic studies, consultations with many physicians, and several surgical explorations. She gives dramatic and exaggerated descriptions of her present and past symptoms, and she makes conflicting statements about her history. She has been hospitalized at least 23 times since age 18 years. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

Options:

A: Somatic symptom disorder
B: Generalized anxiety disorder
C: Dependent personality disorder
D: Borderline personality disorder
E: Munchausen syndrome
F: Conversion disorder
G: Schizophrenia
H: Occult medical disorder
I: Narcissistic personality disorder
J: Histrionic personality disorder

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about a patient's symptoms and I'm supposed to figure out the diagnosis. Let me read the question carefully.

The patient is a 50-year-old woman with recurrent abdominal pain. She's come to the office for the first time. Her chart shows a long history of varying physical symptoms, but no definitive causes found despite extensive tests, consultations, and surgeries. She gives dramatic and exaggerated descriptions, makes conflicting statements, and has been hospitalized 23 times since age 18.

Hmm. I remember that when patients have a lot of physical symptoms without a clear medical cause, it could be something like somatic symptom disorder. But wait, there's more here. She's had many hospitalizations, lots of tests, and even surgeries. And she's giving dramatic descriptions. That makes me think of factitious disorder, maybe Munchausen syndrome.

Munchausen syndrome is when a person fakes or exaggerates symptoms to gain attention and sympathy, often leading to multiple hospitalizations and procedures. In this case, she's had 23 hospitalizations, which is a lot. Also, she's making conflicting statements and giving exaggerated descriptions, which fits the pattern of someone fabricating symptoms.

Wait, but what about somatic symptom disorder? That's when someone has one or more chronic physical symptoms that cause distress, and they can't be explained by a medical condition. But in somatic symptom disorder, the person isn't necessarily fabricating the symptoms; they might genuinely believe they're ill, but there's no clear cause. Here, the fact that she's making conflicting statements and the symptoms are so varied makes me lean more towards factitious disorder.

Another possibility could be histrionic personality disorder. People with this have excessive emotionality, but that's more about their emotional expression and need for attention, rather than fabricating illnesses. They might have dramatic behavior, but not necessarily create false medical histories.

Wait, Munchausen's is a type of factitious disorder, where the person falsifies medical history to gain the role of a patient. So the key here is the extensive medical workups without findings and the fabrication.

So the options are E: Munchausen syndrome, and maybe A: Somatic symptom disorder. Or perhaps E is the better fit because of the fabrication aspect.

Let me look at the options again. Option E is Munchausen, which is a factitious disorder. The description fits because she's had multiple hospitalizations, no causes found, and she's making up symptoms. So I think the answer is E.

The patient is a 50-year-old woman with a history of recurrent abdominal pain, numerous physical symptoms without a clear medical cause, and extensive diagnostic workups that have yielded no definitive findings. She has been hospitalized 23 times since age 18, provides dramatic and exaggerated descriptions of her symptoms, and makes conflicting statements about her history. This pattern suggests she is fabricating or exaggerating her symptoms to gain attention and sympathy, which aligns with the characteristics of Munchausen syndrome, a type of factitious disorder.

While somatic symptom disorder involves chronic physical symptoms that cause distress, it does not typically involve fabrication or the extensive medical manipulation seen here. Histrionic personality disorder, though marked by dramatic behavior, does not specifically involve fabricating illnesses. The key distinguishing factor is the patient's apparent fabrication of symptoms and her history of multiple hospitalizations without medical findings, making Munchausen syndrome the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: E
