Okay, so I have this problem where a salesman sold 927 brushes one week and 1,059 the next. I need to find the percentage increase. Hmm, percentage increase, right. I remember that percentage increase is calculated by taking the difference between the new and original numbers, dividing by the original, and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage.

Wait, let me make sure I get the steps right. So first, find the increase in the number of brushes sold. That would be the next week's sales minus the first week's. So 1,059 minus 927. Let me do that subtraction. 1,059 - 927 is... let's see, 927 plus 100 is 1027, plus 30 is 1057, wait no, that's not right. Wait, 927 plus 132 is 1059? Because 927 + 100 is 1027, plus 32 is 1059. Oh wait, no, because 927 + 132 is 1059. So the increase is 132 brushes.

So the increase is 132. Now, to find the percentage increase, I divide this increase by the original number. The original number is the first week's sales, which is 927. So 132 divided by 927. Hmm, let me calculate that.

Wait, 132 divided by 927. Let me see. Maybe I can simplify this fraction. Both numbers are divisible by 3. 132 ÷3 is 44, and 927 ÷3 is 309. So now it's 44/309. Can I simplify this more? Let me check. 44 and 309. 44 is 4*11, 309 divided by 11 is 28.09, which isn't a whole number. So maybe that's as simple as it gets.

So 44 divided by 309 equals approximately... Let me compute this. 44 ÷ 309. Well, 309 goes into 44 zero times. So 0., and then 440 divided by 309. 309 *1 is 309, subtract from 440 gives 131. Bring down a zero: 1310. 309 *4 is 1236. So 4. 1310 - 1236 is 74. Bring down a zero: 740. 309 *2 is 618. Subtract: 740-618=122. Bring down a zero: 1220. 309 *3 is 927. 1220-927=293. Bring down a zero: 2930. 309*9 is 2781. 2930-2781=149. Hmm, this is getting a bit tedious, but I think the division is approximately 0.14239 or something like that.

Wait, let me double-check. Maybe using a calculator approach. 44/309: Let's see, 309 × 0.14 is 43.26. Oh wait, 0.14 * 309 is 43.26. But 44 is a bit more than that. So 0.14 gives 43.26, so 44-43.26 is 0.74. So 0.74/309 is approximately 0.0024. So 0.14 + 0.0024 is about 0.1424. So approximately 0.1424, which is 14.24% when multiplied by 100.

Looking at the options, option I is 14.239%, which is really close. But wait, let me make sure. Did I make any mistakes in the calculation?

Wait, wait, let me redo that because maybe I miscalculated earlier steps. So the increase is 1,059 - 927. Let me recalculate that. 1,059 minus 927. 927 + 132 = 1059, right? So yes, increase is 132. So 132/927.

Wait, perhaps there's a better way to compute this. Let's think in terms of fractions. 132/927. Let me see if I can write this as a decimal. 927 goes into 132 how many times? It's less than 1, so 0. So 927 into 1320 (adding a decimal and a zero) is 1 time (927), subtract gives 393. Bring down another zero: 3930. How many times does 927 go into 3930? Let's see, 927 *4 is 3,708. 927*4=3708. 3930-3708=222. Bring down another zero: 2220. 927*2=1854. 2220-1854=366. Bring down a zero: 3660. 927*3=2781. 3660-2781=879. Bring down a zero: 8790. 927*9=8343. 8790-8343=447. Bring down a zero: 4470. 927*4=3708. 4470-3708=762. Hmm, this is getting repetitive. Maybe I can see a pattern.

Wait, but earlier when I did 44/309, I got approximately 0.1424, which is 14.24%. So looking back at the options, option I is 14.239%, which is very close. But I'm not sure if I did the division correctly.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using another method. Let's think: 927 times 1.14 equals... Well, 927 * 1 = 927, 927 *0.14 is 927*(0.1 +0.04) = 92.7 + 37.08 = 129.78. So 927 + 129.78 = 1056.78. Wait, that's very close to 1059. So 1.14 times 927 is 1056.78. The actual next week's sales are 1059, which is 2.22 higher than 1056.78. So perhaps the percentage is a little more than 14%. Because 1.14 gives 1056.78, and we're at 1059, which is 2.22 higher. So let's see, 2.22 divided by 927. 2.22/927 is approximately 0.0024, so total is 0.1424, which is 14.24%, which aligns with the earlier calculation.

Looking at the options, option I is 14.239%, which is almost exactly 14.24%. So that would be the correct answer. Wait, but option E is 17.3%, which is higher. Did I make a mistake in the division?

Alternatively, maybe I should approach this differently. Let's calculate 132 divided by 927. So 132 ÷ 927 equals approximately 0.14239. Multiply by 100 gives 14.239%. So yes, that's option I.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes percentage increase can be tricky. Let me make sure I didn't reverse the numbers. The formula is ((New - Original) / Original) × 100. So yes, (1059 - 927) is 132, divided by 927. Yep, that's correct.

So the correct answer should be option I: 14.239%. But wait, looking at the options, option I is 14.239%, which is exactly what I calculated. So I think that's the answer.

To determine the percentage increase in the number of brushes sold, we use the formula for percentage increase:

\[
\text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{New Value} - \text{Original Value}}{\text{Original Value}} \right) \times 100
\]

Here, the original value is 927 (brushes sold in the first week), and the new value is 1,059 (brushes sold in the second week). The increase is:

\[
1,059 - 927 = 132
\]

Next, divide the increase by the original value:

\[
\frac{132}{927} \approx 0.1424
\]

Convert this to a percentage by multiplying by 100:

\[
0.1424 \times 100 \approx 14.24\%
\]

This closely matches option I, which is **14.239%**. After verifying the calculations and ensuring no errors in the division or formula application, the correct answer is:

**I: 14.239%**
