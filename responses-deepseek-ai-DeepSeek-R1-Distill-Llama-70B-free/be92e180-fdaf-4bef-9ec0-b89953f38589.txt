Question:

Of the several ways in which the supersonic transport (SST) acts as a pollutant, one is by the elimination of carbon dioxide (CO_2). During normal flight, CO_2 is released at a temperature of about 627°C and at a press-ure of 0.41 atm at an estimated rate of 6.6 × 10^4 kg per hour. To what volume does this amount of gas correspond?

Options:

A: 2.7 × 10^7 liters
B: 2.7 × 10^9 liters
C: 1.5 × 10^8 liters
D: 1.2 × 10^7 liters
E: 2.7 × 10^5 liters
F: 5.5 × 10^8 liters
G: 2.7 × 10^8 liters
H: 2.7 × 10^6 liters
I: 3.2 × 10^9 liters
J: 8.0 × 10^6 liters

Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the volume of CO2 released by an SST. Hmm, let me think about what I know. I remember from chemistry that the ideal gas law is PV = nRT. Oh wait, right, P is pressure, V is volume, n is moles, R is the gas constant, and T is temperature.

The problem gives me the mass of CO2 released. So first, I think I need to convert that mass into moles. The molar mass of CO2 is carbon (12 g/mol) plus two oxygens (16 each), so 12 + 2*16 = 44 g/mol. 

The mass given is 6.6e4 kg per hour. Oh wait, kg. I need to convert that to grams. Oh right, 1 kg is 1000 grams, so 6.6e4 kg is 6.6e7 grams. To find moles, divide by molar mass. So 6.6e7 g / 44 g/mol. Let me calculate that: 6.6e7 divided by 44 is approximately 1.5e6 moles. Wait, wait, 44 times 1.5e6 is 66e6, which is 6.6e7, yes that's correct.

Next, the ideal gas law. I need to find V. So rearranging PV = nRT to solve for V: V = nRT/P.

But wait, the temperature is given in Celsius. Oh right, I have to convert that to Kelvin. So 627°C plus 273 is 900 K.

The pressure is 0.41 atm. I remember R is 0.0821 L·atm/mol·K. So plugging in the numbers: n is 1.5e6 mol, R is 0.0821, T is 900 K, P is 0.41 atm.

Calculating numerator first: 1.5e6 * 0.0821 * 900. Let's break it down. 1.5e6 times 0.0821 is... 1.5 * 0.0821 = 0.12315, so 0.12315e6. Then multiply by 900. Hmm, 0.12315e6 is 123150. Multiply by 900: 123150 *900 = 110,835,000. Wait, 123,150 times 900 is actually 123150 *9 * 100. 123150 *9 is 1,108,350, so times 100 is 110,835,000. So the numerator is 1.10835e8.

Then divide by P, which is 0.41 atm. So 1.10835e8 / 0.41. Let's compute that. 1.10835e8 divided by 0.4 is approximately 2.77e8, but since it's 0.41, maybe a bit less. Let's see, 0.41 * 2.7e8 = 0.41*270,000,000 = 110,700,000. Hmm, which is close to our numerator. So 1.10835e8 / 0.41 is approximately 2.7e8 liters.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check the calculations because I might have made a mistake. Let me recalculate n. The mass is 6.6e4 kg, which is 6.6e7 grams. Divided by 44 gives 1.5e6 moles. Correct.

Then, V = (1.5e6) * (0.0821) * (900) / 0.41.

Let me compute each part step by step. 

0.0821 * 900 = 73.89. 

1.5e6 * 73.89 = 1.5e6 *7.389e1 = 1.5 *7.389 = 11.0835, so 11.0835e7 (because 1e6 *1e1 =1e7). Wait, 1.5e6 *73.89 = 1.5e6*(70 +3.89) → 1.5e6*70 = 1.05e8, and 1.5e6*3.89≈5.835e6. So total is ≈1.05e8 + 5.835e6 = 110,835,000 which is 1.10835e8 L·atm/mol.

Divide by 0.41 atm: 1.10835e8 / 0.41 = approximately 2.7e8 liters. 

Looking at the options, option G is 2.7e8 liters. So that's probably the correct answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the initial steps. Oh, right, units! The R value I used is correct for L-atm. Yes, so the volume comes out in liters. So yes, option G is 2.7e8 L.

To determine the volume of CO₂ released by the SST, we use the ideal gas law:

\[
PV = nRT \quad \text{or rearranged as} \quad V = \frac{nRT}{P}
\]

### Step 1: Convert the mass of CO₂ to moles
The molar mass of CO₂ is calculated as:

\[
\text{Molar mass of CO}_2 = 12 + (2 \times 16) = 44 \, \text{g/mol}
\]

The mass of CO₂ released is \(6.6 \times 10^4 \, \text{kg/h}\), which is equivalent to \(6.6 \times 10^7 \, \text{g/h}\). Converting this to moles:

\[
n = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{molar mass}} = \frac{6.6 \times 10^7}{44} = 1.5 \times 10^6 \, \text{mol}
\]

### Step 2: Convert temperature to Kelvin
The temperature is given as \(627^\circ \text{C}\). Converting to Kelvin:

\[
T = 627 + 273 = 900 \, \text{K}
\]

### Step 3: Apply the ideal gas law
The pressure is \(P = 0.41 \, \text{atm}\), and the gas constant \(R\) is \(0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)}\). Substituting into the equation:

\[
V = \frac{nRT}{P} = \frac{(1.5 \times 10^6)(0.0821)(900)}{0.41}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
nRT = (1.5 \times 10^6)(0.0821)(900) = 1.10835 \times 10^8 \, \text{L·atm}
\]

Now divide by \(P\):

\[
V = \frac{1.10835 \times 10^8}{0.41} = 2.7 \times 10^8 \, \text{L}
\]

### Final Answer
The volume of CO₂ released corresponds to \(2.7 \times 10^8 \, \text{L}\). Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**G: \(2.7 \times 10^8 \, \text{L}\)**
