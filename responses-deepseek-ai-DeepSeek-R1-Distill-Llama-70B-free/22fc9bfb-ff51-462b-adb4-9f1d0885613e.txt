Question:

A 65-year-old man who is quadriplegic as a result of multiple sclerosis is hospitalized for treatment of left lower lobe pneumonia. His temperature is 38.1°C (100.5°F), pulse is 95/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg. He appears malnourished. Rhonchi are heard at the left lower lobe of the lung on auscultation. Examination of the heart, lymph nodes, abdomen, and extremities shows no abnormalities. There is a 1-cm area of erythema over the sacrum with intact skin and no induration. Neurologic examination shows quadriparesis. Test of the stool for occult blood is negative. Which of the following is the most effective intervention for this patient's skin lesion?

Options:

A: Topical antibiotic ointment
B: Radiation therapy
C: Antifungal treatment
D: Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy
E: Corticosteroid cream application
F: Use of wet to dry dressings
G: Surgical debridement
H: Frequent turning
I: Cryotherapy
J: Whirlpool therapy

Okay, so I've got this question here about a patient with multiple sclerosis who is quadriplegic and hospitalized for pneumonia. The question is about the most effective intervention for his skin lesion. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I'll read the scenario again. The patient is a 65-year-old man who's quadriplegic due to multiple sclerosis. He's in the hospital for left lower lobe pneumonia. His vital signs are a bit elevated—temperature 38.1°C, pulse 95, respirations 12, and BP 120/80. He looks malnourished. On exam, there's erythema over the sacrum, 1 cm area, with intact skin and no induration. The stool test is negative for occult blood, so no GI bleeding.

So, the skin lesion is erythema on the sacrum. Intact skin means no open wound, no breakage. No induration suggests it's not a deep tissue injury yet. But erythema can be the start of a pressure ulcer, especially in someone who's quadriplegic and likely immobile.

Quadriplegic patients are at high risk for pressure ulcers because they can't move around. Pressure sores usually start with erythema, and if not addressed, can progress to more severe stages. So the key here is prevention, right?

The options given are A through J. Let me go through them.

Option A: Topical antibiotic ointment. That's usually for open wounds or infections. Since the skin is intact, maybe not the first line here.

Option B: Radiation therapy. That's for cancer treatment. Not relevant here.

Option C: Antifungal treatment. He has erythema, but unless there's a fungal infection, this isn't indicated.

Option D: Broad-spectrum antibiotics. Again, unless there's an infection, which isn't indicated here. The erythema might just be from pressure, not infection.

Option E: Corticosteroid cream. Could be used for inflammation, but steroids can sometimes weaken the skin, which might not be ideal if it's a pressure area.

Option F: Wet to dry dressings. Those are for wounds, especially to promote debridement. But the skin is intact, so dressings might not be necessary yet.

Option G: Surgical debridement. That's for advanced ulcers with dead tissue. Not applicable here since the skin is intact.

Option H: Frequent turning. Oh, that makes sense. Turning the patient regularly relieves pressure on areas prone to sores. Since he's quadriplegic, he can't move himself, so caregivers need to turn him regularly.

Option I: Cryotherapy. That's freezing, used for things like warts or certain skin lesions. Not relevant here.

Option J: Whirlpool therapy. That's usually for wound cleaning and promoting healing in more advanced cases.

So the skin lesion is early-stage, just erythema. The best intervention is to prevent it from progressing. Frequent turning redistributes pressure, reducing the risk of the area developing into a full-blown pressure ulcer. That's definitely the most effective intervention here.

The patient is a 65-year-old quadriplegic man with multiple sclerosis, hospitalized for pneumonia. He has a 1-cm area of erythema over the sacrum with intact skin and no induration. This lesion is likely an early sign of a pressure-related skin injury, given his immobility. The most effective intervention is to prevent progression by redistributing pressure through frequent turning. This approach addresses the root cause of the issue and aligns with best practices for pressure ulcer prevention.

H: Frequent turning. 

Answer: H
