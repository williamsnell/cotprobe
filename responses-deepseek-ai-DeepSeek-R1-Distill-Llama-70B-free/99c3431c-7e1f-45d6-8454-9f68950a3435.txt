Okay, so I've got this problem here about a factory wanting to buy a machine. Let me try to break it down. The machine costs $600,000, and it's supposed to reduce production costs by $200,000 each year. They want a 20% rate of return on this investment. The question is asking for the minimum life the machine must have to assure this rate of return.

Hmm, I think this is a discounted cash flow problem. I remember that when evaluating investments, we often calculate the payback period or use the net present value method. Since they're talking about a desired rate of return, I think the NPV method is more appropriate here because it considers the time value of money.

So, the formula for NPV is the sum of the present value of each cash flow minus the initial investment. The cash flows here are the savings each year, which is $200,000 annually. The initial outlay is $600,000. We need to find the minimum number of years (n) where the NPV is at least zero, ensuring the 20% rate of return.

The NPV formula for this scenario would be:

NPV = -600,000 + 200,000/(1+0.20)^1 + 200,000/(1+0.20)^2 + ... + 200,000/(1+0.20)^n

We need to find the smallest n where NPV is >= 0.

Alternatively, since each cash flow is the same each year, this is an annuity. So I can use the present value of an annuity formula. The formula for the present value (PV) of an annuity is PV = PMT * [1 - (1 + r)^-n ] / r.

Setting the PV equal to the initial investment:

600,000 = 200,000 * [1 - (1 + 0.20)^-n ] / 0.20

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the present value of the savings should equal the cost. So maybe:

200,000 * [1 - (1.20)^-n ] / 0.20 = 600,000

Let me rearrange this equation to solve for n.

Multiply both sides by 0.20:

200,000 * [1 - (1.20)^-n ] = 600,000 * 0.20

200,000 [1 - (1.20)^-n ] = 120,000

Divide both sides by 200,000:

1 - (1.20)^-n = 120,000 / 200,000

1 - (1.20)^-n = 0.6

So, (1.20)^-n = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4

Hmm, I can take the natural log of both sides to solve for n.

Take ln on both sides:

ln( (1.20)^-n ) = ln(0.4)

Which is -n ln(1.20) = ln(0.4)

So, n = - ln(0.4) / ln(1.20)

Let me calculate that. 

First, ln(0.4) is approximately... Let me think, ln(0.5) is about -0.6931, and 0.4 is a bit lower. Maybe around -0.9163. And ln(1.20) is about 0.1823.

So, n ≈ - (-0.9163) / 0.1823 ≈ 0.9163 / 0.1823 ≈ 5.03 years.

So n is approximately 5.03 years. Since the machine can't operate a fraction of a year in this context, we'd round up to the next whole number, which is 6 years. But wait, wait a second. Because the present value is calculated at the end of each year. So if at 5 years, the NPV isn't yet positive, it would need to go to 6 years.

Wait, but let me think again. Let's compute the NPV at 5 years and see if it's positive or not.

The present value factor for each year would be:

Year 1: 1/(1.2) = 0.8333
Year 2: 1/(1.2)^2 ≈ 0.6944
Year 3: 1/(1.2)^3 ≈ 0.5787
Year 4: 1/(1.2)^4 ≈ 0.4823
Year 5: 1/(1.2)^5 ≈ 0.4019

So the sum of these factors for 5 years is:

0.8333 + 0.6944 = 1.5277
Plus 0.5787 → 2.1064
Plus 0.4823 → 2.5887
Plus 0.4019 → 2.9906

So the total present value of 5 annual $200k savings is 200,000 * 2.9906 ≈ 200,000 * 3 ≈ 600,000, but more precisely 200,000 * 2.9906 = 598,120.

So the NPV is initial cost of 600k minus 598,120 → which is about -1,880. So it's still negative after 5 years.

At 6 years: Add another year's factor.

Year 6: 1/(1.2)^6 ≈ 0.3349

So sum becomes 2.9906 + 0.3349 ≈ 3.3255

Then, 200,000 * 3.3255 = 665,100.

NPV is 665,100 - 600,000 = 65,100, which is positive.

So the NPV crosses zero between year 5 and 6. So the minimum life is just over 5 years. Because at exactly 5 years, it's still slightly negative.

Looking at the options, option D says "slightly greater than 5 years", which would be the correct answer. Option H is exactly 5 years, which isn't enough. Option C is between 5 and 6, which is correct in a way, but D is more precise.

Wait, but let me check the options again.

The options are:

A: between 4 and 5

B: more than 7

C: between 5 and 6

D: slightly greater than 5

E: exactly 6

H: exactly 5

I: more than 6

So the calculated n is about 5.03 years, so just a bit over 5. So the minimum life is 5.03, which is just over 5. So the answer should be D.

But wait, another thought: when you have the NPV at 5 years being slightly negative, you need a little more than 5 years for the NPV to turn positive. So the machine must operate for just a little over 5 years.

So the correct answer is D.

To determine the minimum life the machine must have to assure a 20% rate of return, we use the net present value (NPV) method. The machine costs $600,000 and reduces production costs by $200,000 annually. The NPV formula for this scenario is:

\[
\text{NPV} = -600,000 + \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{200,000}{(1+0.20)^t}
\]

The present value of an annuity formula is applied to calculate the present value of the annual savings:

\[
\text{PV} = 200,000 \times \frac{1 - (1+0.20)^{-n}}{0.20}
\]

Setting the present value of savings equal to the initial cost:

\[
600,000 = 200,000 \times \frac{1 - (1.20)^{-n}}{0.20}
\]

Rearranging and solving for \( n \):

\[
1 - (1.20)^{-n} = 0.6 \quad \Rightarrow \quad (1.20)^{-n} = 0.4
\]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[
-n \ln(1.20) = \ln(0.4) \quad \Rightarrow \quad n = \frac{-\ln(0.4)}{\ln(1.20)}
\]

Using approximate values:

\[
\ln(0.4) \approx -0.9163, \quad \ln(1.20) \approx 0.1823
\]

\[
n \approx \frac{0.9163}{0.1823} \approx 5.03 \, \text{years}
\]

This means the machine must operate for slightly more than 5 years to ensure the desired rate of return. Calculating the NPV at 5 years confirms it is still slightly negative, while at 6 years, it becomes positive. Therefore, the minimum life is just over 5 years.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect, as the required life is greater than 5 years.
- **B**: Incorrect, as the life does not need to exceed 7 years.
- **C**: Incorrect, as the life is not between 5 and 6 years but slightly greater than 5.
- **D**: Correct, as the life is slightly greater than 5 years.
- **E**: Incorrect, as the life does not need to be exactly 6 years.
- **H**: Incorrect, as 5 years is insufficient.
- **I**: Incorrect, as the life does not need to exceed 6 years.
- **J**: Incorrect, as the life is greater than 5 years.

The correct answer is:

**D: slightly greater than 5 years**
