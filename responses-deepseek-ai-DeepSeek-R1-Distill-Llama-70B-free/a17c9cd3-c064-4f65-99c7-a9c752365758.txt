Question:

Connie Computer decided to purchase a $1,000 laptop computer to use during law school. When she went into Computer Retailer Inc., the salesperson also sold her a 5-year service agreement for $1,200 for a total price of $2,200. Nine months later, the laptop stopped working and Computer Retailer refused to perform on their service agreement. If Connie sues Computer Retailer, the trial court will likely find for

Options:

A: Connie, under the common law because the predominate purpose for which the parties contracted was the sale of goods.
B: Connie, under the UCC only if the predominate reason for entering into the contract was for the goods portion of the contract.
C: Connie, under the UCC unless the predominate purpose of the agreement was for the service agreement portion of the contract.
D: Computer Retailer, if the court determines that the predominate purpose of the agreement is determined by intent and not the relative dollars assigned to the computer and the service agreement.

Okay, so I've got this question about contract law, specifically dealing with the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) and common law. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: Connie buys a laptop for $1,000 and a 5-year service agreement for $1,200, totaling $2,200. Nine months later, the laptop breaks, and the retailer refuses to honor the service agreement. Connie sues, and we need to determine who the trial court will likely rule for.

The question is about whether the contract falls under the UCC or common law. I remember that the UCC applies to the sale of goods, while common law applies to services or real estate contracts. But when a contract involves both goods and services, it can get tricky.

So, the key here is determining whether the predominant purpose of the contract was for goods or services. If it's goods, UCC applies; if services, common law applies.

Looking at the options:

Option A says Connie wins under common law because the predominant purpose was the sale of goods. Wait, but if the predominant purpose is goods, then UCC applies, not common law. So A might be incorrect because it's applying the wrong law.

Option B says Connie wins under UCC only if the predominant reason was for goods. That makes sense because UCC would apply if goods were the main focus. But wait, the service agreement is a service, so maybe it's about which part is predominant.

Option C says Connie wins under UCC unless the predominant purpose was the service agreement. Hmm. So if the main purpose was services, then UCC wouldn't apply. But the laptop is goods, and the service is a service. So which is more important here?

Option D says Computer Retailer wins if the court determines intent, not the dollar amounts. So maybe the court looks at what the parties intended, not just the price. But I think the UCC focuses on the predominant purpose, which can sometimes be determined by factors like which is more significant, not just the money.

Wait, the contract has two parts: a laptop (goods) and a service agreement (services). The total is $2,200, with the service being more expensive ($1,200 vs $1,000). So numerically, the service is more costly. But the question is about the predominant purpose.

In some cases, the courts look at which part is predominant in terms of the contract's overall purpose. If the service agreement is for the laptop, maybe the goods are the primary focus, and the service is incidental. Alternatively, if the service is a significant part, it could be considered predominant.

I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact test. I think the UCC applies when the predominant purpose is the sale of goods. If the service is just an add-on, then the whole contract is under the UCC. But if the service is the main thing, then common law applies.

In this case, Connie is buying a laptop and a service agreement. The laptop is a one-time sale, while the service is over five years. The service is more expensive than the laptop. So maybe the court would see the service as the predominant part, applying common law.

But I thought that when goods and services are mixed, the UCC applies if the goods are the main focus. So if the service is tied to the goods (like a warranty or service for the laptop), maybe the UCC still applies because it's part of the same transaction.

Wait, I remember something about the "predominant purpose" test. Courts look at the primary intent of the parties. So if the main reason was to buy the laptop, even if the service costs more, it might still fall under UCC.

Alternatively, some courts might look at the allocation of consideration. Here, the service is $1,200, which is more than the $1,000 laptop. So maybe the predominant purpose is services, thus common law applies.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me think about the options again.

Option C says Connie wins under UCC unless the predominant purpose was the service. So if the service is predominant, UCC doesn't apply. Otherwise, it does.

If the court finds that the main purpose was the laptop (goods), then UCC applies. If it's the service, then common law applies.

In this scenario, the service is more expensive, so maybe the predominant purpose is the service. Then, common law would apply, and the outcome would depend on whether the service agreement is considered a service contract.

But wait, the question is about whether Connie can sue under the UCC. If the contract is governed by the UCC, Connie can enforce the service agreement as part of the goods contract. If it's under common law, maybe the service agreement is a separate contract, and the retailer might have more defenses.

Alternatively, if the service agreement is considered a warranty or maintenance agreement, it's part of the sale of goods, so UCC applies regardless of the price.

I'm a bit confused. Let me recall: The UCC applies to the sale of goods and their related services. For example, when you buy a product with a warranty, the whole contract is under the UCC. But when the services are the main purpose, like hiring a consultant, then common law applies.

In this case, the service agreement is tied to the laptop. So maybe the UCC applies because the predominant purpose is the sale of the laptop, and the service is an add-on.

Looking back at the options:

Option C: Connie wins under UCC unless the predominant purpose was the service agreement.

So if the court decides the predominant purpose was the service, then UCC doesn't apply, and the outcome might favor the retailer. Otherwise, Connie wins under UCC.

But the question is about which option is correct. I think the correct approach is that if the service is the predominant purpose, then common law applies, otherwise UCC.

So the correct answer would be C, because it says Connie wins under UCC unless the predominant purpose was the service.

Alternatively, looking at the options, I think the UCC would apply if the goods are the predominant factor, regardless of price. So in this case, even though the service is more expensive, the laptop is the primary item, so UCC applies.

Wait, but the price might influence the predominant purpose determination. If the service is twice as expensive, maybe the court sees it as the main purpose.

I'm torn between whether the court uses the price or the nature of the goods. I think the predominant purpose is determined by the nature of the transaction, not just the price. So buying a laptop with a service agreement is predominantly for goods.

So the correct option would be C: Connie wins under UCC unless the predominant purpose was the service.

So the trial court will likely find for Connie under the UCC unless the predominant purpose was the service agreement. So the answer is C.

The question revolves around whether the contract between Connie and Computer Retailer falls under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) or common law. The UCC applies to the sale of goods, while common law applies to services. When a contract involves both goods and services, the "predominant purpose" test is used to determine which law applies. If the predominant purpose is the sale of goods, the UCC applies; if it is services, common law applies.

In this case, Connie purchased a laptop (goods) for $1,000 and a 5-year service agreement (services) for $1,200, totaling $2,200. The service agreement is more expensive, but it is tied to the laptop. Courts often look at the nature of the transaction rather than just the price to determine the predominant purpose. If the service agreement is considered incidental to the sale of the laptop, the UCC would apply. However, if the service agreement is deemed the primary focus, common law would apply.

Option C correctly states that Connie will win under the UCC unless the predominant purpose of the agreement was the service agreement. This aligns with the test for determining which law applies, as the court would need to assess whether the service agreement or the laptop was the main focus of the contract.

Answer: C
