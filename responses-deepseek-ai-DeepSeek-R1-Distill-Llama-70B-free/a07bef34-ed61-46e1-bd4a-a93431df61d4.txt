Okay, so I've got this question here about determining the maturity date of a 60-day note that's dated March 15. Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy on how to calculate this, but I'll try to work through it step by step.

First, I remember that when calculating the maturity date, I need to count each month's days correctly, including any days in March beyond the 15th. Since the note is for 60 days, I'll start by adding 60 days to March 15.

Let me break it down. March has 31 days, right? So from March 15, how many days are left in March? That would be 31 minus 15, which is 16 days. Wait, no, because including the 15th, it's 16 days until the end of March. Wait, no, wait. If it's March 15, then the next day is March 16, and the month ends on March 31. So from March 15 to March 31 is 16 days (including the 15th? Or not? Hmm, maybe I should think of it as starting on the 15th, so the days remaining would be March 16 to March 31, which is 16 days. Or maybe it's 16 days including March 15. I'm a bit confused here.)

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to count the days in March after the 15th. So March 15 is the starting point, and the next day is March 16. So from March 16 to March 31, that's 16 days. So if the note is for 60 days, and the first 16 days in March get us to the end of the month, that leaves 60 - 16 = 44 days left to add in April.

So after March, we go to April. April has 30 days, right? So adding 30 days in April would bring us to April 30. But wait, we have 44 days left after March. So 30 days in April would take us to April 30, but we still have 44 - 30 = 14 days left to add in May.

So after April 30, adding 14 days would bring us to May 14. So the maturity date would be May 14. But wait, I'm not sure if I should include the starting date or not. Because when you issue a note on March 15, does the 15th count as day 0 or day 1? I think the 15th is day 0, and the next day is day 1. So when counting 60 days, day 60 would be the maturity date.

Wait, let's try another approach. Let's count March 15 as day 0. Then day 1 is March 16. So 60 days later would be 60 days after March 15.

Alternatively, perhaps a better method is to add 60 days to March 15.

March has 31 days, so from March 15, adding the days in March: 31 - 15 = 16 days left in March. So 16 days bring us to March 31. Then, subtract those 16 days from 60, leaving 44 days.

Now, add those 44 days into April. April has 30 days, so adding 30 days brings us to April 30. Subtract 30 from 44, leaving 14 days.

So now, add 14 days into May. May has 31 days, so 14 days into May would be May 14. So the maturity date is May 14.

Looking at the options, option I is May 14. So the correct answer should be I.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes when calculating due dates, like in some business contexts, the end of the month might be handled differently. For example, if adding days would take you beyond the last day of a month, you just go to the last day. But in this case, since 14 days in May is straightforward, May 14 is correct.

Wait, let me double-check. March 15 plus 60 days.

March: 15 to 31 is 17 days (including the 15th? Or 16 days if starting from the 16th). Hmm, perhaps I should recount.

Wait, if March 15 is day 0, then March 16 is day 1. So from March 15 to March 31 is 16 days (since 31-15=16). So 16 days bring us to March 31 as day 16. Then, 60 - 16 = 44 days remaining.

April has 30 days, so adding 30 days brings us to April 30 as day 46 (16+30=46). Then, 60-46=14 days left. So 14 days into May: May 14. So yes, option I is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps a calendar method would help. Let's list the days:

March 15 (day 0)
March 16: 1
...
March 31: 16

Then April 1:17, and so on, up to April 30: 16+30=46.

So from April 30 (day 46), adding 14 days: May 1 is day 47, May 2:48,... May 14 is day 60.

Yes, so the maturity date is May 14, which is option I.

To determine the maturity date of a 60-day note dated March 15, we start by counting the days remaining in March after March 15. March has 31 days, so from March 16 to March 31, there are 16 days. Subtracting these 16 days from the 60-day term leaves 44 days remaining.

Next, we move to April, which has 30 days. Adding these 30 days to the 16 days already accounted for brings us to April 30, with 14 days remaining (60 - 16 - 30 = 14).

Finally, we add the remaining 14 days to May 1, which brings us to May 14. Therefore, the maturity date of the note is May 14.

From the given options, the correct answer is:

I: May 14

Answer: I
