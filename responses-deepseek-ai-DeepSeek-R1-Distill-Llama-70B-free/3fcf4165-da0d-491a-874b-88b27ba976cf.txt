Question:

An art collector attended a party on March 15. At the party, the art collector was describing his collection to a woman in attendance. When the art collector described a painting by a well-known artist, the woman indicated she might like to buy that painting. The art collector said, "I'll sell you the painting for $10,000. I'll give you 30 days to decide whether you want the painting. " On March 25, the art collector wrote to the woman and stated that the offer of March 15 was withdrawn. The woman received the March 25 letter on March 26. On March 27, the woman wrote the art collector the following letter:"Please be advised that I hereby accept your offer of March 15. " The art collector received this letter on March28. Thereafter, the art collector and the woman engaged in several telephone discussions. On April 10, the woman, in a telephone conversation, told the art collector that she would pay $15,000 if the painting was delivered on or before April 15. The art collector agreed to deliver the painting for $15,000. On April 15, the art collector tendered the painting, but the woman refused to pay more than $10,000. If the art collector asserts a claim against the woman for breach of contract, which of the following is the most accurate statement?

Options:

A: An enforceable contract does not exist between the parties, because of mutual mistake of fact.
B: There is no enforceable contract, because the woman did not accept the initial offer in writing.
C: The art collector is obligated to sell the woman the painting for $10,000, because the woman, as offeree, had the right to accept the initial offer within the 30-day period.
D: The art collector is obligated to sell the painting for $10,000 as the woman accepted the original offer before it was revoked.
E: The woman is obligated to pay the art collector $10,000, because the art collector did not properly revoke the initial offer.
F: Since the parties entered into a subsequent modification, the woman is obligated to pay the art collector $15,000 for the painting.
G: The woman is not obligated to pay any amount, because the initial offer was not legally binding.
H: The woman is obligated to pay $15,000, because she agreed to this price during their telephone conversation on April 10.
I: The woman is obligated to pay $15,000 as the new agreement made on April 10 supersedes the initial offer.
J: Since the art collector, as offeror, had the power to revoke the original offer before acceptance, the woman is obligated under the terms of their April 10 agreement.

Okay, so I have this contract law question to tackle. Let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my contract law, but I'll try to remember the key points.

The scenario is about an art collector and a woman at a party. The collector offers to sell a painting for $10,000 with a 30-day decision period. Let me note the timeline:

- March 15: Offer made. 30 days means acceptance must be by April 14 (since March has 31 days, so 15th +30 is April 14).
- March 25: Collector sends a letter withdrawing the offer.
- March 26: Woman receives the withdrawal letter.
- March 27: Woman writes to accept the March 15 offer.
- March 28: Collector receives the acceptance.

Then, they talk on the phone on April 10. The woman offers $15,000 if delivered by April 15. Collector agrees. But on April 15, she refuses to pay more than $10k.

The question is about whether there's a contract and who's in breach.

First, I need to figure out if a contract was formed between the collector and the woman. Let's think about the offer, acceptance, revocation, etc.

1. **Offer and Revocation:**
   The collector made an offer on March 15 with a 30-day period. Generally, an offer can be revoked unless it's an option contract (which requires consideration) or under the firm offer rule (like under UCC for merchants with a signed writing). Here, there's no indication of consideration for an option, so the collector can revoke the offer any time before acceptance.

   The collector sent a revocation on March 25, which the woman got on March 26. Then she tried to accept on March 27. But once the revocation is effective, any subsequent acceptance would be too late.

   Wait, but when does revocation become effective? I think it's when the offeree receives it. So the revocation was received on March 26. Her acceptance was on March 27, which is after the revocation. So her acceptance was too late. Therefore, no contract based on the original offer.

2. **Subsequent Agreement:**
   After that, they had phone discussions. On April 10, they agreed on $15k if delivered by April 15. The collector agreed. So this looks like a new offer from the woman to pay $15k, which the collector accepted. So this would be a new contract.

3. **Performance and Breach:**
   On April 15, the collector delivers, but the woman refuses to pay more than $10k. So she's breaching the April 10 agreement. But wait, does the original offer have any bearing here?

   Alternatively, did they form a new contract on April 10? If so, the woman is obligated to pay $15k. But wait, let me double-check.

Other points to consider:

- **Option Contracts:** The initial offer was open for 30 days, but without consideration, it's not an option. So the collector could revoke it anytime before acceptance, which he did on March 25.

- **Acceptance After Revocation:** The woman tried to accept after the revocation, which wouldn't be valid. So the original offer is off the table.

- **New Agreement:** The April 10 agreement is a new contract. Both parties agreed to the new terms. So the woman is bound to pay $15k.

Looking at the options:

Option F: Since the parties entered into a subsequent modification, the woman is obligated to pay $15k.

Option I: The new agreement supersedes the initial offer.

Option H: She agreed to $15k, so she must pay that.

Wait, but in contract law, for a modification to be enforceable, usually both parties must agree, and there must be consideration unless under certain exceptions (like UCC ยง 2-209). Here, the modification was done by mutual agreement, so it's likely binding.

So the correct answer would be that the woman is obligated to pay $15k because they entered into a new agreement.

Looking at the options, F says that the subsequent modification means she owes $15k. I think that's correct. Alternatively, option H says she's obligated because she agreed during the call. But I think the correct reasoning is that they modified the contract, so F is more accurate.

Wait, but let me read the options again.

Option F: "Since the parties entered into a subsequent modification, the woman is obligated to pay the art collector $15,000 for the painting."

Option I: "The woman is obligated to pay $15,000 as the new agreement made on April 10 supersedes the initial offer."

Hmm, I'm a bit confused now. The initial offer was revoked, so the new agreement is a separate contract, not a modification of the initial one. So maybe it's a new contract, not a modification. So I is saying the new agreement supersedes the initial offer, so she's bound by the $15k.

Wait, but the initial offer was revoked. So the only existing contract after that is the April 10 agreement. So the woman's obligation arises from that new contract.

So both F and I suggest she owes $15k, but for slightly different reasons.

Wait, F says it's a subsequent modification, which implies that the original contract was modified. But if the original was revoked, maybe it's a new contract. So I think I is more accurate because the new agreement is separate and supersedes the initial offer.

But I'm a bit confused between F and I.

Alternatively, what about option J? It says since the collector revoked the offer before acceptance, the woman is obligated under the April 10 terms. That makes sense because the original offer was revoked, so no contract there, but the new agreement is valid.

Wait, let me think again. The initial offer was revoked on March 25, before the woman accepted. So her March 27 acceptance was ineffective. So no contract from the initial offer. Then, on April 10, they made a new contract for $15k. So the woman is bound by that.

So in the options, F and I are about the new agreement. But the question is whether it's a modification or a new contract.

Since the original offer was revoked, the new agreement isn't a modification but a new offer and acceptance. So the correct reasoning is that the parties entered into a new contract on April 10, so the woman is obligated under that. So F says "subsequent modification", which might not be accurate. I says the new agreement supersedes, which is correct.

So the correct answer would be F or I. Alternatively, H says she's obligated because she agreed during the phone call. H is also a possible option.

Wait, but H says she agreed to the price, which is correct, but it's about the formation of the contract. So the answer is F, I, or H.

Wait, the options are:

F: The parties entered into a subsequent modification.

I: The new agreement supersedes the initial offer.

H: She agreed to $15k during the call.

I think the correct answer is F or I. But the initial offer was revoked, so the new agreement is a new contract, not a modification. So I think the correct option is I.

Wait, but option I says "as the new agreement made on April 10 supersedes the initial offer." That seems correct because the initial offer was revoked, and the new agreement is a separate contract.

Alternatively, option F says it's a modification, which might not be the case.

So I think the correct answer is I.

Wait, but let me double-check. The initial offer was revoked, so the new agreement is a separate contract, not a modification. So the woman is bound by the new contract for $15k. So options F and I are about the new agreement. Since it's a new contract, option I is more accurate.

So the answer should be F or I. I'm a bit stuck here.

Wait, the question is about which statement is the most accurate. Let's review the options again.

Option F: Subsequent modification, so woman must pay $15k.

Option I: New agreement supersedes initial offer.

Option H: She agreed to $15k, so she must pay.

I think the best answer is F because the parties did agree to a modification after the initial offer was revoked, which was replaced by the new terms. But wait, the initial offer was revoked, so the original contract didn't exist, so the new terms are a new contract, not a modification.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The correct reasoning is that the original offer was revoked, so no contract from that. The new agreement is a separate contract for $15k, so the woman is bound to pay that. So the answer is F or I.

Alternatively, option J says the woman is obligated under the April 10 agreement because the collector revoked the original offer. That makes sense because the original was revoked, no contract there, but the new agreement stands.

So option J says: Since the art collector, as offeror, had the power to revoke the original offer before acceptance, the woman is obligated under the terms of their April 10 agreement.

Yes, that seems accurate. So J is the correct answer.

Wait, but earlier I thought J was about the revocation and the new agreement. So J is correct because the original offer was revoked, so no contract there, but the new agreement on April 10 is valid. So the woman is bound by that.

So the correct answer is J. Because the collector revoked the offer before acceptance, so no original contract. But then they made a new agreement, so she's obligated under that.

Looking back at the options:

Option J: Since the art collector, as offeror, had the power to revoke the original offer before acceptance, the woman is obligated under the terms of their April 10 agreement.

Yes, that's correct.

The scenario involves an art collector and a woman negotiating the sale of a painting. The key events and legal principles are as follows:

1. **Initial Offer and Revocation**:  
   - On March 15, the art collector made an offer to sell the painting for $10,000, giving the woman 30 days to accept.  
   - On March 25, the collector revoked the offer, which the woman received on March 26.  
   - The woman attempted to accept the original offer on March 27, but since the revocation was already effective, her acceptance was too late. Therefore, no contract was formed based on the original offer.

2. **Subsequent Agreement**:  
   - On April 10, the parties orally agreed to a new terms: the woman would pay $15,000 if the painting was delivered by April 15.  
   - This constitutes a new contract, as the original offer had been revoked and replaced by mutually agreed-upon terms.

3. **Breach of Contract**:  
   - On April 15, the collector delivered the painting, but the woman refused to pay more than $10,000, breaching the new agreement.  

4. **Analysis of Options**:  
   - **Option A**: Incorrect. There is no mutual mistake of fact.  
   - **Option B**: Incorrect. The womanโs acceptance of the original offer was invalid due to revocation, not because of a lack of writing.  
   - **Option C**: Incorrect. The womanโs acceptance of the original offer was too late, as the offer had already been revoked.  
   - **Option D**: Incorrect. The original offer was revoked before acceptance, so no contract exists based on those terms.  
   - **Option E**: Incorrect. The revocation was properly effected before acceptance.  
   - **Option F**: Incorrect. The April 10 agreement is not a modification of the original contract but a new contract.  
   - **Option G**: Incorrect. The April 10 agreement is legally binding.  
   - **Option H**: Incorrect. While the woman agreed to $15,000, the reasoning does not address the revocation of the original offer.  
   - **Option I**: Incorrect. The April 10 agreement is a new contract, not a modification of the original offer.  
   - **Option J**: Correct. The collector properly revoked the original offer, and the woman is obligated under the terms of the new agreement formed on April 10.

The most accurate statement is that the woman is obligated under the terms of the April 10 agreement because the original offer was revoked before acceptance, and the new agreement constitutes a valid contract.
