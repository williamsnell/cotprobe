Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here about the change in entropy of hydrogen gas when the piston is withdrawn isothermally. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem states that the hydrogen is confined in a cylinder with a piston. The cross-sectional area of the piston is 5 cm². The initial conditions are at room temperature, 25°C, which I know is 298 K in Kelvin. The pressure is 2 atm, and the volume is 500 cm³.

The question is asking for the change in entropy when the piston is withdrawn isothermally through a length of 100 cm. So, this is an isothermal process, meaning the temperature stays constant throughout.

I remember that for an isothermal process, the change in entropy (ΔS) can be calculated using the formula ΔS = nR ln(Vf / Vi), where n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant, and Vf and Vi are the final and initial volumes, respectively. Alternatively, since PV = nRT, another formula involving pressure can be used: ΔS = nR ln(Pi / Pf). Because in isothermal processes, the change in entropy depends on volume or pressure changes.

Wait, but in this case, since the process is isothermal and reversible, I think either formula should work. But maybe it's easier to stick with volumes because the pressure might change, but the problem gives me the initial pressure and volume, so maybe I can find the number of moles first.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I need to find n or if there's another way. Let me think again. Since ΔS is being sought, and the process is isothermal, the formula is definitely ΔS = nR ln(Vf / Vi). But I don't know n. Alternatively, since n = (PV)/(RT), I can express ΔS in terms of pressure and volume changes.

Wait, but perhaps I can express the entropy change in terms of the initial and final pressures or volumes without knowing n. Let me think about the formula again. Oh, right! Another version of the entropy change formula for an ideal gas during an isothermal process is ΔS = nR ln(Vf / Vi) = nR ln(Pi / Pf). But since I don't have the final pressure, maybe using the volume change is better.

So first, I need to find the final volume after the piston is moved. The piston is moved a length of 100 cm. The cross-sectional area is 5 cm². So the additional volume would be the area multiplied by the length moved. Let me calculate that.

Area (A) = 5 cm². Length (d) moved = 100 cm. So the change in volume ΔV = A * d = 5 cm² * 100 cm = 500 cm³. Wait, but initial volume is 500 cm³, so the final volume Vf = Vi + ΔV = 500 + 500 = 1000 cm³.

So Vi is 500 cm³, Vf is 1000 cm³. So the ratio Vf/Vi is 2. So ln(2) is about 0.693.

But wait, I think I should use the formula ΔS = nR ln(Vf / Vi). But I don't know n, the number of moles. Oh, but I can find n from the initial conditions using the ideal gas law.

Initial conditions: P = 2 atm, V = 500 cm³, T = 25°C = 298 K.

Wait, but I need to convert the units correctly because the gas constant R is usually in J/(mol·K), which uses volume in m³, pressure in Pascals.

Let me see. The initial volume is 500 cm³. Since 1 m³ is 1e6 cm³ (because 1 m = 100 cm, so (100 cm)^3 = 1e6 cm³). So 500 cm³ = 500 / 1e6 m³ = 5e-4 m³.

The pressure is 2 atm. One atm is 101325 Pascals. So 2 atm is 2 * 101325 = 202650 Pa.

The temperature is 298 K.

So using PV = nRT, n = (PV)/(RT) = (202650 Pa * 5e-4 m³) / (8.314 J/mol·K * 298 K).

Let me compute that. Let's calculate numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator: 202650 * 5e-4 = 202650 * 0.0005 = let's see, 202650 * 5e-4 = (202650 * 5) / 1000 = 1013250 / 1000 = 1013.25 J (since Pa·m³ is equivalent to J).

Denominator: 8.314 * 298 ≈ 8.314 * 300 = 2494.2, but wait, 298 is 2 less than 300. So 8.314 * 298 = 8.314*(300-2) = 8.314*300 - 8.314*2 = 2494.2 - 16.628 = 2477.572 J/mol.

So n = 1013.25 J / 2477.572 J/mol ≈ 0.409 moles.

Wait that seems a bit low, but let's proceed.

So now, ΔS = n R ln(Vf / Vi) = 0.409 * 8.314 * ln(1000 / 500) = 0.409 * 8.314 * ln(2).

Compute ln(2) ≈ 0.693.

So 0.409 * 8.314 ≈ Let me compute 0.4 *8.314=3.3256, and 0.009*8.314=0.0749, so total ≈ 3.3256 +0.0749=3.4005.

Then multiply by 0.693: 3.4005 * 0.693 ≈ Let me compute that.

3 * 0.693 = 2.079, 0.4005 *0.693≈0.2775. So total ≈ 2.079 + 0.2775≈2.3565 J/K.

Wait, but the options are all around 0.3 to 0.9 J/K. So 2.35 J/K isn't an option, which suggests I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, wait a minute. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the volume change. Let me double-check.

The piston is moved 100 cm, and the cross-sectional area is 5 cm². So the change in volume is area times length, yes. So 5 cm² * 100 cm = 500 cm³. So initial volume is 500 cm³, so final is 1000 cm³. So that part is correct.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units when calculating n. Let's recheck the n calculation.

n = (P V) / (R T). But I think I might have messed up the units for pressure or volume. Let me use another approach.

Alternatively, using R = 8.314 J/mol·K, but maybe using R = 8.314 J/(mol·K) and pressure in Pa, volume in m³.

Wait, yes, I did that correctly. So 2 atm is 202650 Pa.

Wait, wait, but 500 cm³ is 0.5 liters. Oh, wait, wait! 500 cm³ is 0.5 liters, and 1 liter is 0.001 m³. So 500 cm³ is 0.0005 m³, which I correctly converted earlier.

So n = (202650 * 0.0005) / (8.314 * 298) = (101.325) / (2477.572) ≈ 0.0409 moles.

Wait, wait, 202650 * 0.0005 is 101.325, yes. So 101.325 / 2477.572 ≈ 0.0409 moles. Oh wait! I think I made a mistake in the n calculation earlier. Earlier I thought that 202650 *5e-4 is 1013.25 J, but that's incorrect. Wait, 202,650 * 0.0005 is 101.325 J, not 1013.25 J. Oh, I see. So n = 101.325 / (8.314 *298) = 101.325 / 2477.57 ≈ 0.0409 moles.

Ah, okay that's where I went wrong. So n is approximately 0.0409 moles.

Now, let's recalculate ΔS.

ΔS = n R ln(Vf / Vi)

n = 0.0409 mol, R = 8.314 J/mol·K, ln(2) ≈ 0.693.

So ΔS = 0.0409 * 8.314 * 0.693.

Compute 0.0409 *8.314 first.

0.04 *8.314 = 0.33256, 0.0009*8.314=0.0074826, so total ≈0.33256 +0.0074826=0.34004.

Multiply by 0.693: 0.34004 *0.693 ≈ 0.2357 J/K.

Wait, that's approximately 0.236 J/K. Looking at the options, H is 0.24, which is close. But let me check the calculation more accurately.

Wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately:

n = 101.325 / (8.314 *298) = let me compute 8.314 *298.

8.314 *298: 8 *298 = 2384, 0.314 *298 ≈ 93.772. So total ≈ 2384 +93.772≈2477.772.

So n = 101.325 /2477.772 ≈ 0.0409 mol.

Now, ΔS = n R ln(Vf/Vi) = 0.0409 *8.314 * ln(2).

Compute 0.0409 *8.314 first.

0.04 *8.314 = 0.33256.

0.0009 *8.314=0.0074826.

So 0.0409 *8.314= 0.33256 +0.0074826≈ 0.3400426.

Multiply by ln(2)=0.693147:

0.3400426 * 0.693147 ≈ Let's compute:

0.3 * 0.693147 = 0.2079441.

0.04 *0.693147= 0.027726.

0.0000426 *0.693147≈ 0.0000295.

Adding them together: 0.2079441 + 0.027726 = 0.2356701 + 0.0000295≈0.2357 J/K.

So approximately 0.2357 J/K. The closest option is H: 0.24 JK^-1.

But wait, let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I should have used the pressure approach because the volume approach might have a mistake. Wait, no, because for isothermal processes, the change in entropy can be calculated using either volume or pressure, since ΔS = nR ln(Vf/Vi) = nR ln(Pi/Pf).

Alternatively, let's compute using pressure. Let's see if it gives the same result.

Initial pressure Pi = 2 atm.

Final pressure Pf: Since the volume doubles (from 500 to 1000 cm³) and temperature is constant, from PV = nRT, P is inversely proportional to V. So Pf = Pi * Vi / Vf = 2 atm * (500/1000) = 1 atm.

So ΔS = nR ln(Pi/Pf) = nR ln(2/1) = nR ln(2), which is the same as before.

Wait, so yes, same result.

Wait, but I'm getting approximately 0.2357 J/K, which is 0.236 J/K. The option H is 0.24 JK^-1, which is very close. So the answer would be H.

But wait, let me recheck the n calculation with more exact numbers to ensure I didn't make any error.

n = (P V) / (R T) = (2 atm * 500 cm³) / (R * 298 K).

Wait, 500 cm³ is 0.5 liters. 2 atm * 0.5 L = 1 L·atm. I remember that 1 L·atm is approximately 101.325 J, but that's not necessary here.

But let me compute it using more precise numbers.

n = (2 atm * 500 cm³) / (R * 298 K).

But n = (P V)/(R T) → units need to be compatible. Let me use R = 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K).

Wait, 8.314 J/(mol·K) is the same as 8.314 (Pa·m³)/(mol·K), but 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) is another common value for R.

So with R = 0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K), let me recalculate.

P = 2 atm, V = 500 cm³ = 0.5 L, T =298 K.

n = (2 atm * 0.5 L) / (0.0821 L·atm/(mol·K) * 298 K) = (1 L·atm) / (24.4858 L·atm/mol) ≈ 0.0409 moles.

Same as before. So n is correct.

Thus, ΔS ≈ 0.0409 *8.314 *0.693 ≈ 0.235 J/K, which is approximately 0.24 J/K.

So the correct answer is H: 0.24 JK^-1.

To determine the change in entropy of the hydrogen gas during the isothermal process, we use the formula for entropy change of an ideal gas:

\[
\Delta S = nR \ln\left(\frac{V_f}{V_i}\right)
\]

### Step 1: Calculate the final volume
The piston is withdrawn a distance of 100 cm, and the cross-sectional area of the piston is 5 cm². The additional volume created is:

\[
\Delta V = \text{Area} \times \text{Length} = 5 \, \text{cm}^2 \times 100 \, \text{cm} = 500 \, \text{cm}^3
\]

The initial volume is \( V_i = 500 \, \text{cm}^3 \), so the final volume is:

\[
V_f = V_i + \Delta V = 500 \, \text{cm}^3 + 500 \, \text{cm}^3 = 1000 \, \text{cm}^3
\]

Thus, the volume ratio is:

\[
\frac{V_f}{V_i} = \frac{1000}{500} = 2
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of moles of gas
Using the ideal gas law \( PV = nRT \), we solve for \( n \), the number of moles. The given pressure is \( P = 2 \, \text{atm} \), the temperature is \( T = 298 \, \text{K} \), and the initial volume is \( V = 500 \, \text{cm}^3 = 0.5 \, \text{L} \). The gas constant \( R \) is \( 0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)} \). Substituting:

\[
n = \frac{PV}{RT} = \frac{(2 \, \text{atm})(0.5 \, \text{L})}{(0.0821 \, \text{L·atm/(mol·K)})(298 \, \text{K})}
\]

\[
n = \frac{1 \, \text{L·atm}}{24.4858 \, \text{L·atm/mol}} \approx 0.0409 \, \text{mol}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the entropy change
Substitute \( n = 0.0409 \, \text{mol} \), \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J/(mol·K)} \), and \( \ln(2) \approx 0.693 \) into the entropy formula:

\[
\Delta S = nR \ln\left(\frac{V_f}{V_i}\right)
\]

\[
\Delta S = (0.0409 \, \text{mol})(8.314 \, \text{J/(mol·K)})(0.693)
\]

First, calculate \( nR \):

\[
nR = (0.0409)(8.314) \approx 0.340 \, \text{J/K}
\]

Now multiply by \( \ln(2) \):

\[
\Delta S = (0.340 \, \text{J/K})(0.693) \approx 0.235 \, \text{J/K}
\]

### Step 4: Match the result to the closest option
The calculated entropy change is approximately \( 0.235 \, \text{J/K} \), which is closest to option **H: 0.24 JK\(^{-1}\)**.
