Okay, so I've got this question about birth control methods in the U.S., specifically for married couples. Hmm, I need to figure out which one is the most common. The options are A through J, each a different method.

Let me start by recalling what I know about birth control methods. I remember that the most common methods vary by country and demographic factors. In the U.S., I think the pill is widely used, but I'm not sure if that's the top for married couples.

Looking at the options, I see the pill isn't listed here. Wait, the options are A to J. Let me check each option:

A: Contraceptive sponge – I don't think that's very common. It's less effective and not as popular as other methods.

B: Diaphragm – It's a barrier method, but I don't think it's the most used among married people.

C: Cervical cap – Even less common than the diaphragm, I believe.

D: Abstinence – That's not really a method people use long-term, especially after marriage.

E: Emergency contraception – That's for after unprotected sex, so not a primary method.

F: Birth control patch – It's a hormonal method, similar to the pill but not as popular.

G: Sterilization – This includes things like vasectomy or tubal ligation. I think this is a common method for people who are certain they don't want more children. Married couples, especially those with children, might opt for this as a permanent solution.

H: IUD – Intrauterine devices are becoming more popular, I've heard. They're long-lasting and have high efficacy. I think they're widely used, especially among women who have had children.

I: Rhythm method – Also known as natural family planning. It's not very effective and I don't think many people rely on it as their main method.

J: Birth control implant – Like Nexplanon, which is effective but not as commonly used as other methods.

So, between G and H. I'm trying to remember statistics. I think that in the U.S., among married couples, sterilization is the most common method. Because once they've had children, they might choose a permanent solution. IUDs are popular but maybe not the top choice yet.

Wait, I recall that according to some surveys, the pill is the most common among all women, but for married couples, especially older ones, sterilization is higher. Because the pill is more for younger women who might still be planning families.

So the options here don't include the pill, so among the given options, G: Sterilization is likely the answer.
