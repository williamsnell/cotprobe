Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm a bit new to series, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The problem is to evaluate the series S, which is given as 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + ... and so on. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, I remember that series can sometimes be summed up if they're geometric. Let me think, a geometric series has each term multiplied by a common ratio, right? So I need to check if this series fits that pattern.

Looking at the terms: the first term is 1/2. The next term is 1/4, which is (1/2) * (1/2). Then 1/8 is (1/4) * (1/2), and so on. Oh, so each term is half of the previous term. That means the common ratio r is 1/2.

I think the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series is S = a / (1 - r), where a is the first term and r is the common ratio, but only if |r| < 1. In this case, r is 1/2, which is less than 1, so the formula should work.

So plugging in the values, a is 1/2 and r is 1/2. So S becomes (1/2) divided by (1 - 1/2). Let me compute the denominator first: 1 minus 1/2 is 1/2. So now it's (1/2) divided by (1/2). Dividing fractions is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal, so (1/2) * (2/1) equals 1. 

Wait, that would make S equal to 1. Looking at the options, option I is 1. So the answer should be I. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The series starts at 1/2 and each time it's multiplied by 1/2. So yes, it's a geometric series with a = 1/2 and r = 1/2. The formula applies because r is positive and less than 1. So sum is 1. Yep, I think that's correct.

The given series 

$$
S = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{16} + \cdots
$$

is a geometric series where each term is multiplied by a common ratio \( r = \frac{1}{2} \). The first term \( a \) is \( \frac{1}{2} \). For an infinite geometric series with \( |r| < 1 \), the sum is given by:

$$
S = \frac{a}{1 - r}.
$$

Substituting \( a = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( r = \frac{1}{2} \):

$$
S = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{1}{2}} = 1.
$$

Thus, the sum of the series is 1. The correct answer is:

I: 1
