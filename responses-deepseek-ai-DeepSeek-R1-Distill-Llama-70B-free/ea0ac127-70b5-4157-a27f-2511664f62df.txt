Okay, so I have this Doppler shift question in front of me. I'm a bit rusty on the topic, but let me try to think it through. The question is asking in which situation there's no perceived Doppler shift. So I need to remember what causes a Doppler shift and when it doesn't occur.

Doppler shift happens when there's a relative motion between the source of the sound and the detector. Like when a source is moving towards you, the pitch sounds higher, and when it's moving away, the pitch is lower. Also, if the observer is moving towards a stationary source, they perceive a higher pitch.

So the question is looking for a scenario where the Doppler shift doesn't happen. That would mean the perceived frequency is the same as the source frequency. So when is that the case?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Both source and detector are rotating around a common axis. Hmm. Wait, if they're rotating together, maybe their relative speeds are the same? Like, if they're on a merry-go-round moving at the same speed in the same direction, perhaps the distance between them isn't changing. So no Doppler shift. Or maybe it's like if they're moving in a circular path but maintaining the same position relative to each other. I'm not entirely sure about this one, but it's a possibility.

Option B: Detector moves towards a stationary source. That should cause a Doppler shift. The detector approaching would hear a higher pitch. So this can't be the correct answer.

Option C: Both moving in the same direction. Wait, if they're moving in the same direction, but what about their speeds? Suppose both are moving at the same speed. Then the relative speed between them is zero. So no Doppler shift. Or if the source is moving away but the detector is moving away at the same speed, then no shift. Alternatively, if one is faster than the other, then there would be a shift.

Wait, the option says "both travel in the same direction." So whether they're moving at the same speed or different. If same speed, no shift. If different, then there would be. So the option doesn't specify same speed, so it's possible that they could be moving at same speed, making this a possible correct scenario. Alternatively, if they're moving at different speeds, there would be a shift. So this option could be a possible correct answer if it's the case where their relative speeds result in no change.

Option D: Source moves away from stationary detector. That definitely causes a Doppler shift. The pitch would be lower. So not the correct answer.

Option E: Both move in opposite directions, moving away from each other. So both are moving away, increasing the distance. That would lower the frequency, causing a Doppler shift. So this isn't the scenario with no shift.

Option F: Source moves toward stationary detector. That's the classic Doppler effect situation, so definitely a shift. Not the answer.

Option G: Source and detector move opposite directions, source moving towards detector. Wait, if they're moving towards each other, that increases the relative speed, causing a higher pitch. So there's a Doppler shift. Not the correct scenario.

Option H: Detector moves away from stationary source. Then the detector would perceive a lower pitch. So Doppler shift occurs. Not the correct answer.

So now let's think again about the possible correct options. The question is which situation allows for NO Doppler shift.

So let's go back:

Option A: Both rotating around a common axis. Suppose they're moving in a circular path, same speed, same direction. Then their relative positions don't change in terms of moving towards or away. So maybe the distance between them doesn't change, so no Doppler shift. But wait, in circular motion, even if they're rotating together, the direction of motion relative to the line between them might change. Hmm. Wait, but if they're on the same circular path and rotating at the same angular speed, the distance between them remains the same. So no relative movement towards or away, so no Doppler shift. So this could be a correct scenario.

Option C: Both moving in same direction. If they're moving at the same speed, then the relative speed is zero. So if the source emits a wave, the detector moving at the same speed as the source would perceive the same frequency. So in that case, no Doppler shift.

Wait, but the option says "both travel in the same direction." So it's possible that they're moving at same speed, leading to no shift. So both options A and C could be correct, but the question is multiple-choice, so only one option is correct.

Wait, the question is which of the following situations is possible to have no shift. So any scenario where the relative speed is zero.

So for option C, if both are moving in same direction at same speed, then no shift. If the speeds are different, then shift. So option C is possible to have no shift, but it's not guaranteed. The question is asking in which situation it's possible, so option C could be a correct answer.

Similarly, option A's scenario could result in no shift if they're moving in a way that their relative speed towards each other is zero.

Wait, but in option A, both are rotating around a common axis. Let's think about two people on a merry-go-round, facing each other as it spins. The distance between them doesn't change, so as the platform rotates, each is moving in a circle. But their velocity vectors are changing direction, but relative to each other, their speeds towards or away depend on their positions.

Wait, but for two objects moving in perfect circles with same angular velocity, same radius, same direction, their relative positions might not change, so the line between them doesn't experience any change in length. So no Doppler shift.

So in that case, option A would have no Doppler shift.

But wait, in circular motion, even if they're moving in circles with same angular velocity, their velocities are tangential. So the direction of their velocity relative to each other changes, but the component along the line connecting them (the line of sight) would vary. Hmm, maybe that's more complicated.

Alternatively, if two objects are moving in a circle with same center, same radius, and same angular speed, but same direction, then their velocity vectors are always tangent to the circle. The line connecting them rotates, but the rate at which they approach or recede from each other would vary.

Wait, perhaps when they're moving in a circle, their relative velocity in the direction of the line connecting them changes over time. So perhaps at some points they are moving towards each other, at others moving away. But perhaps if the rotation is such that their relative motion along the line of sight is zero on average, maybe no net Doppler shift?

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on this. Maybe I should focus on the simpler option C.

So for option C, when both are moving in the same direction but at same speed. For example, a source and detector moving to the right at same speed. So the source emits a wave at speed v_sound relative to the medium (let's say air). The detector is moving along with the source at same speed, so the waves would reach it at the same frequency as when both are stationary.

So in that case, no Doppler shift.

Thus, option C is a possible scenario where there's no Doppler shift.

Wait, but the question is about "possible that there's no perceived Doppler shift." So any scenario where it's possible. So if the option allows for a situation where the shift is zero, then that's a correct answer.

So for option C, if both are moving in same direction at same speed, then no shift. So option C is a possible scenario.

Now, looking back at the options, the correct answer would be either A or C.

But wait, the question is which situation makes it possible to have no Doppler shift.

So for option A, both rotating around a common axis. Let me think of an example. Imagine two people sitting on a rotating platform, facing each other. The platform rotates around its center. Both are moving in circles. So from the perspective of each, the other is moving in a circle as well.

But from the source's frame, the detector is moving, and vice versa. So the Doppler effect would depend on their relative velocities.

Wait, in such a scenario, the Doppler shift would depend on the component of their velocities along the line connecting them. For instance, at the point when they're moving directly towards each other, that component would cause a Doppler shift. But when moving away, another shift. So overall, the Doppler shift would vary periodically, unless the rotation is such that their relative velocity along the line of sight is zero.

Wait, but if the two are diametrically opposite on the rotating platform, and the platform rotates at a certain speed, then their velocity vectors are opposite. At any given moment, their velocities relative to each other would change. It's possible that when they are moving towards each other, the detector would perceive a higher pitch, and when moving away, a lower pitch. So overall, the average would be no shift? Or would it vary over time?

Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe it's easier to think of the Doppler shift formula.

The general Doppler shift formula when both source and observer are moving is:

f' = f * (v + vo) / (v - vs)

Where v is the speed of sound, vo is the observer's speed towards the source, vs is the source's speed towards the observer.

So for Doppler shift to be zero, f' must equal f. So,

(v + vo)/(v - vs) = 1

Which implies v + vo = v - vs → vo = -vs.

So the observer's speed towards the source must equal the source's speed away from the observer. So if the observer is moving towards the source at speed u, and the source is moving away at speed u, then the Doppler shift is zero.

Wait, no, because vo is the speed of the observer towards the source, and vs is the speed of the source towards the observer. So if the source is moving away, vs is negative.

Let me clarify. Let me define the directions. Let's say the source is moving with speed vs (positive if moving towards the observer, negative if moving away). Similarly, the observer's speed vo is positive if moving towards the source, negative if moving away.

So the condition for no Doppler shift is:

(v + vo) / (v - vs) = 1

So,

v + vo = v - vs → vo = - vs

Which means the observer's speed towards the source equals the source's speed away from the observer.

So for example, if the source is moving away at speed u, and the observer is moving towards the source at speed u, then vo = u (since observer moving towards), vs = -u (source moving away). So vo = - vs → vo = u, vs = -u. So condition holds, no Doppler shift.

So in this scenario, the source is moving away at u, observer moving towards at u. So their relative motion is zero in terms of approach.

So in the options, any situation where vo = -vs would result in no Doppler shift.

Looking back at the options:

Option C: Both source and detector travel in same direction.

So let's say, both moving to the right. The source emits sound, the detector is moving.

If the source is moving to the right at speed vs, and the detector is moving to the right at speed vo. So in this scenario, if the source and detector are moving at same speed (vo = vs), then relative to each other, their speeds are zero. So no Doppler shift. Because the source moving to the right, and the detector moving to the right at same speed would perceive the same frequency.

Wait, but according to the formula, what would happen?

If the source is moving at vs (say, to the right), and the detector is moving at vo (to the right), then the Doppler shift formula would be:

If the source is moving away from the detector (since both are moving in same direction but same speed), then vs is negative (since it's moving away). So vs = -u, and vo = u (since moving towards the source). Wait, no, if the source is moving to the right, and the observer is moving to the right, then the source's movement relative to the observer depends on their speeds.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let's clarify.

If both are moving in same direction, at same speed. So the source emits a wave at speed v in the medium. The source is moving at speed vs, the observer at vo. So the Doppler formula when the source is moving and the observer is moving is:

f' = f (v + vo) / (v - vs)

If both are moving to the right at same speed, say vs = vo = u (u positive to the right), then:

f' = f (v + u) / (v - u)

Which is higher than f. So that implies a Doppler shift.

Wait, but wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the signs.

In the standard Doppler formula, the source moving towards the observer has vs positive, and the observer moving towards the source has vo positive.

So in our case, both are moving in the same direction. Let's say the source is moving to the right at speed vs, and the observer is moving to the right at speed vo.

So the source's movement relative to the medium is vs to the right, and the observer's movement is vo to the right.

So for the Doppler shift:

f' = f (v + vo) / (v - vs)

But in this case, if the source is moving away from the observer (since both moving same direction), then the denominator becomes (v - vs), and if vs is in same direction as the sound, which is usually considered as positive when moving towards the observer.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting tangled up in sign conventions. Let me think about it differently. When the source and observer are moving in the same direction, their relative speed is (vo - vs). If the observer is moving faster than the source, then the observer is catching up, which would cause a higher frequency. If the source is moving faster, it's moving away, causing a lower frequency.

Wait, but in the case where both move at same speed, the relative speed is zero. So the observed frequency would be same as emitted.

Wait, perhaps in that case, when both are moving at same speed in same direction, the Doppler shift is zero. Because the source emits the wave at speed v, but since the medium is moving with them (assuming the medium, like air, is moving along), wait no, the medium is stationary unless there's wind.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating things. Let's consider the medium (air) as stationary.

If the source is moving to the right at speed u, and the detector is moving to the right at speed u. So both are moving at same speed in same direction.

The source emits a wave. The wave speed in the medium is v. From the medium's frame, the source emits waves at speed v, but since it's moving, the waves in front are compressed and behind are stretched.

But the detector is moving at same speed as the source. So for the detector, the relative speed of the wave would be v (since it's moving at same speed as the source). So the frequency would be same as emitted.

Wait, but that's only if the source is stationary relative to the medium. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Alternatively, when the source is moving at speed u to the right, the emitted frequency is perceived by a stationary observer as f' = f (v) / (v - u). Because the source is moving away.

But if the detector is also moving to the right at speed u, then the formula becomes f_observed = f (v + u) / (v - u).

Wait, that would be higher than the emitted frequency. So in that case, there would be a Doppler shift.

But earlier reasoning suggested that if their speeds are same, there's no shift.

Hmm, this is confusing. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me think of an example.

Imagine the source is emitting at frequency f. The source is moving to the right at speed u. The medium is stationary.

A detector moving to the right at speed u would have a velocity vo = u (to the right).

So applying the formula:

f' = f (v + vo) / (v - vs)

Where vs is the source's speed towards the observer.

Wait, in this case, the source is moving to the right, same as the detector. So the source's movement relative to the medium is vs = u (to the right), which is away from the detector (since the detector is also moving to the right). So vs is positive in the denominator as (v - vs), but since the source is moving away, vs would be positive? Wait, I'm getting confused with the signs.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is:

If the source is moving away from the detector, vs is positive in the denominator (v - vs), leading to a lower frequency.

If the source is moving towards the detector, vs is negative, leading to higher frequency.

Similarly, if the detector is moving towards the source, vo is positive in the numerator (v + vo), increasing the frequency.

So in our scenario where both are moving to the right at speed u.

The source is moving away from the detector, so vs is positive (since moving away), so denominator is (v - u).

The detector is moving towards the source? No, because both are moving in same direction. So the detector is moving away from the source as well. So the detector's movement is away from the source, so vo would be negative in the formula.

Wait, no. Wait, if the source is moving to the right, and the detector is also moving to the right, then from the source's perspective, the detector is moving away. So the detector's speed relative to the source is (u_detector - u_source) = 0, because same speed. So the relative speed is zero.

Wait, but in the Doppler formula, the velocities are relative to the medium.

So in the medium's frame:

Source moving at u to the right.

Detector moving at u to the right.

So when the source emits a wave, the wavefronts are emitted at speed v in the medium. The source is moving, so the wavefronts in front are closer together (higher frequency) if moving towards, or stretched (lower frequency) if moving away.

The detector, moving at u to the right, would intercept these wavefronts.

So the time between wavefronts as experienced by the detector is:

The wave speed relative to the detector is v - u (since the detector is moving towards the wave at u, but the wave is moving at v. Wait, no. If the wave is moving to the right at v, and the detector is moving to the right at u, then relative to the detector, the wave's speed is v - u. So the time between crests is 1/(f' ) = (1/f) * (v - u)/(v + u) ? Not sure.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to compute using the Doppler formula.

The source is moving
