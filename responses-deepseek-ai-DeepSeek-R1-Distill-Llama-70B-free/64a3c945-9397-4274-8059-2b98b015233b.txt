Okay, so I'm looking at this differential equation problem, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm still getting the hang of these. But let's try to break it down step by step.

The problem is an initial value problem for a second-order linear homogeneous differential equation. The equation is y'' +5y' +6y = 0, with initial conditions y(0)=2 and y'(0)=β, where β is positive. The question is asking for the smallest value of β such that y_m (I think y_m here refers to the maximum value of y) is at least 4. So I need to find the minimum β where the maximum of y(t) is 4 or more.

First, I remember that for linear homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients, we can solve them by finding the characteristic equation. The characteristic equation for this DE would be r² + 5r +6 = 0. Let me solve that real quick.

The quadratic formula gives r = [-5 ± sqrt(25 - 24)] / 2. Since 25-24 is 1, the square root is 1. So r = (-5 ±1)/2. That gives r = (-5+1)/2 = -2, and r = (-5-1)/2 = -3. So the two real roots are -2 and -3.

Since the roots are real and distinct, the general solution is y(t) = C1*e^(-2t) + C2*e^(-3t), where C1 and C2 are constants determined by the initial conditions.

Now, applying the initial conditions. At t=0, y(0)=2. Plugging t=0 into the general solution:

y(0) = C1*e^(0) + C2*e^(0) = C1 + C2 = 2. So equation (1): C1 + C2 = 2.

Next, find y'(t). Differentiating y(t), y' = -2C1*e^(-2t) -3C2*e^(-3t). At t=0, y'(0)=β:

y'(0) = -2C1 -3C2 = β. So equation (2): -2C1 -3C2 = β.

Now, we have a system of two equations:

1) C1 + C2 = 2

2) -2C1 -3C2 = β

I can solve this system for C1 and C2 in terms of β. Let me solve equation 1 for C1: C1 = 2 - C2. Substitute into equation 2:

-2*(2 - C2) -3C2 = β

Expanding: -4 + 2C2 -3C2 = β → -4 - C2 = β → So C2 = - (β +4).

Wait, wait, let me double-check that. Because when I substitute C1=2 - C2 into equation 2:

-2*(2 - C2) = -4 + 2C2. Then subtract 3C2: -4 + 2C2 -3C2 = -4 - C2. So equation 2 becomes -4 - C2 = β. So C2 = -4 - β.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me redo that substitution:

Equation 2 after substitution: -2*(2 - C2) -3C2 = β → (-4 + 2C2) -3C2 = β → -4 - C2 = β → So rearranging, C2 = -4 - β.

Hmm, that seems a bit odd because if β is positive, then C2 becomes more negative. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the algebra. Wait, maybe I did. Let's go through it again.

Equation 1: C1 + C2 =2 → C1 = 2 - C2.

Equation 2: -2C1 -3C2 = β.

Substitute C1: -2*(2 - C2) -3C2 = β → (-4 + 2C2) -3C2 → -4 - C2 = β.

Yes, that's correct. So C2 = - (β +4).

Wait, but plugging this back into equation 1: C1 = 2 - C2 → 2 - (-β -4) = 2 + β +4 = β +6.

So C1 = β +6 and C2 = - (β +4).

So the solution becomes y(t) = (β +6)e^(-2t) + [ - (β +4) ] e^(-3t).

Simplify that: y(t) = (β +6)e^(-2t) - (β +4)e^(-3t).

Now, the problem wants the maximum value of y(t), y_m, to be at least 4. So I need to find the smallest β>0 such that the maximum of y(t) is ≥4.

To find the maximum of y(t), I think I need to find where the derivative y’(t) equals zero. Because the maximum occurs where the slope is zero.

Wait, but y(t) is a combination of decaying exponentials, so the maximum would occur either at t=0 or at some t>0 where y’(t)=0.

Wait, let's think about the behavior. At t=0, y(0)=2. As t increases, each exponential term decays, but the coefficients might cause y(t) to first increase before decreasing. So the maximum could be at t=0 or at a critical point where y’(t)=0.

Wait, but the initial value y(0)=2, and we need y_m ≥4. So the maximum must occur at some t>0 because 2 is less than 4.

So to find when y(t) reaches 4, we need to find t such that y(t)=4 and y’(t)=0 at that point. Because that's where the maximum occurs.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to find the critical points by setting y’(t)=0 and then find y at that point, set it equal to 4, and solve for β.

Wait, that makes sense. So let's compute y’(t) and set it to zero.

We have y(t) = (β +6)e^(-2t) - (β +4)e^(-3t).

Compute y’(t):

y’(t) = -2(β +6)e^(-2t) + 3(β +4)e^(-3t).

Set y’(t) = 0:

-2(β +6)e^(-2t) + 3(β +4)e^(-3t) = 0.

Let me rearrange this:

3(β +4)e^(-3t) = 2(β +6)e^(-2t).

Divide both sides by e^(-3t):

3(β +4) = 2(β +6) e^(t).

Because e^(-2t)/e^(-3t) = e^(t).

So, 3(β +4) = 2(β +6) e^(t).

Let me solve for t:

e^(t) = [3(β +4)] / [2(β +6)].

Taking natural log on both sides:

t = ln[ (3(β +4)) / (2(β +6)) ) ].

Wait, but the argument of the logarithm must be positive. Since β>0, let's check if (3(β+4))/(2(β+6)) is positive. Both numerator and denominator are positive because β>0, so β+4 and β+6 are positive. So yes, the logarithm is defined.

So the critical point is at t = ln[ (3(β +4))/(2(β +6)) ].

Now, plug this t back into y(t) to find y at this critical point.

y(t) = (β +6)e^(-2t) - (β +4)e^(-3t).

But since at this t, we have e^(t) = 3(β+4)/(2(β+6)), let's compute e^(-2t) and e^(-3t).

e^(-2t) = [e^(t)]^(-2) = [3(β+4)/(2(β+6))]^(-2) = [2(β+6)/(3(β+4))]^2.

Similarly, e^(-3t) = [e^(t)]^(-3) = [3(β+4)/(2(β+6))]^(-3) = [2(β+6)/(3(β+4))]^3.

So substituting into y(t):

y(t) = (β +6) * [2(β+6)/(3(β+4))]^2 - (β +4) * [2(β+6)/(3(β+4))]^3.

Let me factor this expression to simplify.

Let me denote k = [2(β+6)]/[3(β+4)].

Then, y(t) = (β +6) * k² - (β +4) * k³.

Let me compute this:

Compute each term:

First term: (β +6) * k².

Second term: - (β +4) * k^3.

So y(t) = (β +6)k² - (β +4)k^3.

Factor out k²:

y(t) = k² [ (β +6) - (β +4)k ].

Now, substitute k = [2(β+6)]/[3(β+4)].

So,

y(t) = [ [2(β+6)]/[3(β+4)] ]^2 * [ (β +6) - (β +4)* [2(β+6)]/[3(β+4)] ) ].

Hmm, this is getting a bit messy. Let me compute step by step.

First, compute k²:

k² = [2(β+6)/(3(β+4))]^2 = 4(β+6)^2 / [9(β+4)^2].

Then, compute the term inside the brackets:

(β +6) - (β +4)* [2(β+6)/(3(β+4))] ).

Let me compute this:

= (β+6) - [2(β+6)(β+4)]/[3(β+4)].

Simplify the second term: [2(β+6)(β+4)]/[3(β+4)] = [2(β+6)/3] (since (β+4) cancels out).

So the term becomes:

= (β+6) - [2(β+6)/3].

Factor out (β+6):

= (β+6) [1 - 2/3] = (β+6)(1/3) = (β+6)/3.

So now, putting it all together:

y(t) = [4(β+6)^2 / (9(β+4)^2)] * [ (β+6)/3 ].

Multiply these together:

= [4(β+6)^2 * (β+6)] / [9(β+4)^2 * 3].

Simplify denominator: 9*3=27.

And numerator: 4*(β+6)^3.

So,

y(t) = [4 (β+6)^3 ] / [27 (β+4)^2 ].

We set this equal to 4 because we want the maximum y_m to be at least 4. So:

4 (β+6)^3 / [27 (β+4)^2 ] = 4.

We can divide both sides by 4:

(β+6)^3 / [27 (β+4)^2 ] = 1.

Multiply both sides by 27 (β+4)^2:

(β+6)^3 = 27 (β+4)^2.

Let me expand both sides.

First, expand (β+6)^3:

= β^3 + 18β^2 + 108β + 216.

And 27(β+4)^2:

= 27*(β^2 +8β +16) = 27β^2 +216β +432.

So the equation is:

β^3 +18β^2 +108β +216 = 27β^2 +216β +432.

Bring all terms to the left side:

β^3 +18β^2 +108β +216 -27β^2 -216β -432 = 0.

Combine like terms:

β^3 + (18β^2 -27β^2) + (108β -216β) + (216 -432) =0.

So,

β^3 -9β^2 -108β -216 =0.

Hmm, that's a cubic equation. Need to solve for β>0.

Let me write it as β³ -9β² -108β -216 =0.

I can try to factor this. Maybe using rational root theorem. Possible rational roots are factors of 216 divided by factors of 1. So possible roots include ±1, ±2, ±3, etc.

Let me test β=6:

6³ -9*(6)^2 -108*6 -216 = 216 - 324 -648 -216.

Wait: 216-324 is -108, minus 648 is -756, minus 216 is -972. Not zero.

Try β= -2:

(-2)^3 -9*(-2)^2 -108*(-2) -216 = -8 -36 +216 -216 = (-8-36)= -44 + (216-216)=0. So -44 +0= -44 ≠0.

Try β= 12:

12³=1728, 9*12²=9*144=1296, 108*12=1296, 216.

So 1728 -1296 -1296 -216.

Compute step by step:

1728 -1296 = 432.

432 -1296 = -864.

-864 -216 = -1080 ≠0.

Hmm, maybe β= -3:

(-3)^3 -9*(-3)^2 -108*(-3) -216 = -27 -81 +324 -216.

Compute: -27-81= -108 +324=216 -216=0.

Oh, so β= -3 is a root. So we can factor (β +3) from the cubic.

Using polynomial division or synthetic division:

Divide β³ -9β² -108β -216 by (β +3).

Using synthetic division:

-3 | 1  -9  -108  -216

Multiply -3 *1 = -3. Add to -9: -12.

-3 * (-12)=36. Add to -108: -72.

-3*(-72)=216. Add to -216: 0.

So the cubic factors as (β +3)(β² -12β -72).

Now set each factor to zero. So β +3=0 → β=-3, which we can ignore since β>0.

Then, β² -12β -72=0.

Use quadratic formula: β = [12 ± sqrt(144 + 288)] / 2.

Because sqrt(144 + 4*1*72) → sqrt(144 +288)=sqrt(432)=sqrt(16*27)=4*sqrt(27)=4*3*sqrt(3)=12√3.

Wait, let me compute sqrt(432). 432=16*27, so sqrt(16*27)=4*3√3=12√3. So sqrt(432)=12√3.

So β = [12 ±12√3 ] /2 = 6 ±6√3.

Since β>0, we take the positive root: 6 +6√3.

Compute 6√3 ≈6*1.732≈10.392, so 6+10.392≈16.392.

Wait, but looking at the options, option B is 16.3923, which matches this.

Wait, but let me make sure. Because we set y(t) =4 at the critical point, which is the maximum. So the smallest β where y_m=4 is β=6 +6√3≈16.3923, which is option B.

But wait, let me just make sure I didn't make a mistake in the algebra when expanding the cubic equation.

Wait, the equation after moving all terms to left was:

β³ -9β² -108β -216=0.

Factored as (β+3)(β²-12β-72)=0.

Yes, because (β+3)(β²-12β-72) = β³ -12β² -72β +3β² -36β -216 = β³ -9β² -108β -216. So correct.

Thus, solutions are β=-3, and [12 ±sqrt(144 +288)]/2 = [12 ±sqrt(432)]/2 = [12 ±12√3]/2=6 ±6√3.

So positive solution is 6+6√3≈6+10.392≈16.392, which is option B.

To solve the initial value problem 

$$
y'' + 5y' + 6y = 0, \quad y(0) = 2, \quad y'(0) = \beta,
$$

we first find the general solution of the differential equation. The characteristic equation is 

$$
r^2 + 5r + 6 = 0,
$$

which has roots \( r = -2 \) and \( r = -3 \). Thus, the general solution is 

$$
y(t) = C_1 e^{-2t} + C_2 e^{-3t}.
$$

Applying the initial conditions, we solve for \( C_1 \) and \( C_2 \). From \( y(0) = 2 \), we get:

$$
C_1 + C_2 = 2. \tag{1}
$$

From \( y'(0) = \beta \), we compute \( y'(t) = -2C_1 e^{-2t} - 3C_2 e^{-3t} \), so:

$$
-2C_1 - 3C_2 = \beta. \tag{2}
$$

Solving this system, we find:

$$
C_1 = \beta + 6, \quad C_2 = -(\beta + 4).
$$

Thus, the solution is:

$$
y(t) = (\beta + 6)e^{-2t} - (\beta + 4)e^{-3t}.
$$

To determine the maximum value of \( y(t) \), we find the critical points by setting \( y'(t)
