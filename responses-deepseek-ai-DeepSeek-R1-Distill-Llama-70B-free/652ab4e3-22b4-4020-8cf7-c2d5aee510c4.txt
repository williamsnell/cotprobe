Question:

In a certain animal species, four alleles (a^+, a^1, a^2 and a^3) have a locus on chromosome 1. Another series of alleles (b^+, b^1 and b^2) have their locus on chromosome 2. Theoretically, how many genotypes are possible with respect to these two allelic series?

Options:

A: 120 possible genotypes
B: 24 possible genotypes
C: 30 possible genotypes
D: 60 possible genotypes
E: 72 possible genotypes
F: 108 possible genotypes
G: 12 possible genotypes
H: 90 possible genotypes
I: 48 possible genotypes
J: 36 possible genotypes

Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again to make sure I understand.

The question is about the number of possible genotypes in an animal species with two different allelic series. The first series is on chromosome 1 and has four alleles: a^+, a^1, a^2, and a^3. The second series is on chromosome 2 with three alleles: b^+, b^1, and b^2. They're asking for the theoretical number of possible genotypes considering both series.

Hmm. I remember that each genotype is determined by the combination of alleles at each locus. Since these are two different chromosomes, the loci are independent, so I can calculate the combinations separately and then multiply them.

Wait, right, the number of possible genotypes for each locus is calculated by considering how many alleles there are, and then figuring out how many different ways they can combine. Since each individual has two alleles per locus (one from each parent), the number of possible genotypes for each locus is the number of possible pairs, including homozygous and heterozygous cases.

So for the a-series on chromosome 1: there are 4 alleles. The number of possible genotypes here would be the number of combinations of these alleles taken two at a time. But wait, wait—because each genotype is a pair, and the order doesn't matter (like a^+ a^1 is the same as a^1 a^+), so it's a combination, not a permutation.

The formula for combinations is n(n+1)/2, where n is the number of alleles. Because for each allele, it can pair with every other, including itself. So let's compute that.

For a: n=4. So 4 * (4 +1)/2 = 4*5/2=10. So 10 possible genotypes for the a locus.

Now for the b-series on chromosome 2: three alleles. Using the same method. n=3, so 3*(3+1)/2 = 3*4/2=6. So 6 possible genotypes for the b locus.

Since these are independent (they're on different chromosomes), the total number of possible genotypes is the product of the two. So 10 * 6 = 60.

Wait, but let me think again. Wait, no, wait. Oh wait, no, each locus's possible alleles are independent, so you multiply the number of possibilities for each locus.

Wait, but the question is about the number of possible genotypes with respect to these two allelic series. So each genotype is a combination of the a genotype and the b genotype.

So if there are 10 possibilities for a and 6 for b, the total is 10*6=60.

Looking at the options, option D is 60. So the answer should be D.

To determine the number of possible genotypes for the given animal species, we analyze the two allelic series independently and then combine the results.

1. **For the a-series (chromosome 1):**  
   There are 4 alleles (a⁺, a¹, a², a³). The number of possible genotypes is calculated using the combination formula for pairs of alleles:  
   \[
   \text{Number of genotypes} = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
   \]  
   where \(n = 4\). Substituting,  
   \[
   \frac{4(4+1)}{2} = \frac{4 \cdot 5}{2} = 10
   \]  
   Thus, there are 10 possible genotypes for the a-series.

2. **For the b-series (chromosome 2):**  
   There are 3 alleles (b⁺, b¹, b²). Using the same formula:  
   \[
   \text{Number of genotypes} = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
   \]  
   where \(n = 3\). Substituting,  
   \[
   \frac{3(3+1)}{2} = \frac{3 \cdot 4}{2} = 6
   \]  
   Thus, there are 6 possible genotypes for the b-series.

3. **Total number of genotypes:**  
   Since the two loci are on different chromosomes, the genotypes are independent. The total number of possible genotypes is the product of the genotypes for each series:  
   \[
   10 \cdot 6 = 60
   \]

Therefore, the total number of possible genotypes is **60**, which corresponds to option **D**.
