Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the horsepower, torque, and efficiency of a shunt motor. Hmm, I remember that shunt motors have some specific characteristics, but I'm not entirely sure how to approach the calculations here. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the given data is:
- I_l = 19.8 amperes (I think this is the line current)
- E_l = 230 volts (probably the line voltage)
- Balance reading = 12 lbs. Corrected for zero reading. I'm not entirely sure what that means, but I think it relates to the torque measurement.
- Brake arm = 2 ft. Oh right, the brake arm is the distance from the center of the shaft to where the force is applied. So torque is force times this distance.
- Speed = 1100 r/min (rotations per minute)

I need to find horsepower, torque, and efficiency.

Let me recall the formulas I need. 

Horsepower (hp) is calculated using the formula:
hp = (Torque * Speed) / 5252

Torque in a motor is usually calculated from the force applied and the brake arm. Since the balance reading is 12 lbs., I think that's the force. So torque would be force multiplied by the brake arm. Wait, but I have to make sure the units are correct. Brake arm is in feet, so torque would be in lb-ft.

So torque T = Force * Brake arm. Force is 12 lbs, arm is 2 ft, so T = 12 * 2 = 24 lb-ft. Hmm, that seems straightforward.

Now for horsepower. Using the formula: hp = (24 lb-ft * 1100 rpm) / 5252. Let me compute that.

Wait, 24 * 1100 is 26,400. Divided by 5252. Let me calculate that. 26,400 / 5252 ≈ 5.03 hp. So around 5.03 hp.

Next, efficiency. Efficiency is the ratio of output power to input power, expressed as a percentage. So I need to find both the output power and the input power.

Output power is the mechanical power, which is the horsepower multiplied by 746 watts per hp. But wait, since we already have hp, perhaps it's easier to calculate it in watts and then compare.

Wait, line voltage is 230V, line current is 19.8A. So the input power is V * I. So 230 *19.8 = let's see. 200*19.8=3960, 30*19.8=594, total is 4554 watts.

The output power is the mechanical power. The horsepower is about 5.03 hp. Since 1 hp is 746 watts, output power is 5.03 *746 ≈ let's calculate that.

5 *746=3730, 0.03*746=22.38, so total is 3730 +22.38=3752.38 watts.

Efficiency η = (output power / input power) *100. So 3752.38 /4554 *100.

Let me compute that. 3752.38 /4554 ≈ 0.824, so 82.4% efficiency.

Putting it all together: 5.03 hp, 24 lb-ft torque, 82.4% efficiency.

Now looking at the options, let's see. Option I says 5.03 hp, 24 lb-ft, 82.4%. Option A says 6.03 hp but that's higher than what I got. Option E has 5.03 hp, 24 lb-ft, but 80.4% efficiency, which is lower than my calculation. Option I matches exactly.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Torque: 12 lbs *2 ft =24 lb-ft. That's correct.

Horsepower: (24 *1100)/5252 = let's compute 24*1100=26400. 26400/5252. Let me compute 5252 *5=26260. 26400-26260=140. So 5 + 140/5252 ≈5.0266, which is about 5.03 hp. Correct.

Efficiency: Input is 230 *19.8 = 4554 W. Output is 5.03 *746 ≈3752 W. 3752/4554 = approximately 0.824, which is 82.4%. So yes, option I matches all these values.

To calculate the horsepower, torque, and efficiency of the shunt motor, the following data is provided:

- **Line current (Iₗ):** 19.8 A  
- **Line voltage (Eₗ):** 230 V  
- **Balance reading:** 12 lbs (force applied)  
- **Brake arm:** 2 ft  
- **Speed:** 1100 r/min  

### Step 1: Torque Calculation  
Torque is calculated using the formula:  
\[
T = \text{Force} \times \text{Brake arm}
\]  
Substituting the values:  
\[
T = 12 \, \text{lbs} \times 2 \, \text{ft} = 24 \, \text{lb-ft}
\]  

### Step 2: Horsepower Calculation  
Horsepower is calculated using the formula:  
\[
\text{hp} = \frac{T \times \text{Speed}}{5252}
\]  
Substituting the values:  
\[
\text{hp} = \frac{24 \, \text{lb-ft} \times 1100 \, \text{r/min}}{5252} \approx 5.03 \, \text{hp}
\]  

### Step 3: Efficiency Calculation  
Efficiency is the ratio of output power to input power, expressed as a percentage:  
\[
\eta = \left( \frac{\text{Output power}}{\text{Input power}} \right) \times 100
\]  
- **Input power:**  
\[
P_{\text{in}} = Eₗ \times Iₗ = 230 \, \text{V} \times 19.8 \, \text{A} = 4554 \, \text{W}
\]  
- **Output power:**  
\[
P_{\text{out}} = \text{hp} \times 746 = 5.03 \, \text{hp} \times 746 \, \text{W/hp} \approx 3752 \, \text{W}
\]  
- **Efficiency:**  
\[
\eta = \frac{3752}{4554} \times 100 \approx 82.4\%
\]  

### Final Results  
- **Horsepower:** 5.03 hp  
- **Torque:** 24 lb-ft  
- **Efficiency:** 82.4%  

### Correct Option  
The correct option that matches these values is:  
**I: 5.03 hp, 24 lb-ft, 82.4%**
