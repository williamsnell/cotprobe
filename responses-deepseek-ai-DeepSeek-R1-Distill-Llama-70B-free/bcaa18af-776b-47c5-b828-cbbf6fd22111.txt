Okay, so I've got this question about whether a certain set F is sequentially compact. The set F is defined as all functions F(x) which are integrals from 0 to x of f(t) dt, where f is in M. And M is the set of bounded functions in C[0,1]. Hmm. I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down.

First, I need to remember what sequential compactness means. If I recall correctly, a set is sequentially compact if every sequence in the set has a convergent subsequence that also lies within the set. So the question is whether F is sequentially compact.

Now, F is a set of functions where each function is an integral of some f in M. M consists of all bounded continuous functions on [0,1], right? So each F(x) is the integral of a bounded function. Since f is bounded, say |f(t)| ≤ M for all t, then F(x) is Lipschitz continuous with constant M. Because the integral's derivative is f(x), so the slope can't be steeper than M. That means all functions in F are Lipschitz continuous with some constant, but I'm not sure if they all share the same Lipschitz constant or if each can have different M's. Wait, since f is any bounded function, each F could have a different bound. So maybe the Lipschitz constants are not uniform across F.

Wait, but for Arzelà-Ascoli theorem, we need equicontinuity and uniform boundedness. Oh wait, Arzelà-Ascoli is about sequences in C[0,1] being compact if they're equicontinuous and uniformly bounded. So how does that apply here? Let me think.

Each F(x) is absolutely continuous because it's an integral of an f that's at least in L^1, but since f is continuous, F is in C^1. So F is smooth. But what about the set F? Are the functions in F uniformly bounded and equicontinuous?

Uniform boundedness: Let's see. For each F in F, F(0)=0, and F(1) is the integral from 0 to 1 of f(t) dt. Since f is bounded by some M (which can vary per f), the integral could be up to M*1 = M. So |F(x)| ≤ M for all x in [0,1]. But wait, each F could have a different M, so the set F isn't necessarily uniformly bounded because the bounds can vary for each function. Unless... If M is the set of bounded functions, each f has its own sup, but we're considering F as the set of all such integrals. So the F's might not be bounded uniformly. That could be a problem for Arzelà-Ascoli.

Wait, but the sup of F(x) for each F is the integral of f from 0 to 1, which is at most the sup of |f| times 1. So each F is bounded by the sup of |f|, which is finite, but each F can have a different bound. So the set F isn't uniformly bounded. That's a problem because Arzelà-Ascoli requires uniform boundedness.

What about equicontinuity? Equicontinuity means that for every epsilon >0, there's a delta>0 such that for all x,y in [0,1], |x - y| < delta implies |F(x) - F(y)| < epsilon for all F in F. Since each F is differentiable (because F' = f, which is continuous), the derivative is f, which is bounded, but each F could have a different bound on the derivative. So the Lipschitz constants aren't uniform. For example, if f_n(t) = n, which is a constant function, but wait, no, f has to be in C[0,1], so it's continuous, but can have very high sup. Wait, no, M is the set of bounded functions. Oh wait, no: M is the set of bounded functions, so each f in M has sup |f(t)| < infinity, but that doesn't mean they're uniformly bounded across all f. So each F(x) is Lipschitz with constant equal to the sup of |f| for that particular f, but different F's can have different Lipschitz constants. So the family F isn't equicontinuous because the moduli of continuity aren't uniform across all functions in F.

Therefore, Arzelà-Ascoli's conditions aren't satisfied because F isn't uniformly bounded (each F can have a different bound) and isn't equicontinuous (different Lipschitz constants). So F isn't compact in the sup norm, and thus not sequentially compact either.

Wait, but wait. Wait a minute, maybe I made a mistake here. Because the set M is the set of bounded functions, but when we take F(x) as the integral of f, maybe F is actually a subset of some space where it's compact. Alternatively, perhaps M is a subset of C[0,1], which is the space of continuous functions, and F is a linear operator on M. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe F is bounded in the sup norm and equicontinuous. Wait, let me think again. Suppose all f in M are bounded by some M. Then F(x) would be bounded by M, and F' (x) = f(x), so |F(x) - F(y)| ≤ M |x - y|, which would make them Lipschitz with constant M, hence equicontinuous. But if the bound on f varies, then each F could have a different Lipschitz constant. So if the Lipschitz constants are not uniform, then equicontinuity fails.

Wait, the question says M is the set of bounded functions, but each f can have a different bound. So the set F is { integral of f | f is bounded and continuous on [0,1] }. So F consists of all absolutely continuous functions on [0,1] whose derivatives are bounded (since f is bounded), but the bounds can vary.

So, is F a sequentially compact set? I think not, because you can have a sequence of functions in F where the derivatives are getting larger and larger. For example, take f_n(t) = n for t in [0,1/n], and 0 otherwise. Wait, but f_n must be continuous. Oh, because M is the set of bounded functions in C[0,1], so f_n must be continuous. Hmm, I can't just take a step function. Maybe take f_n(t) = n for t in [0,1], but that's not possible because it's unbounded. Wait, no, because M is the set of bounded functions. So each f_n must be bounded, but perhaps their sup norms are increasing.

Wait, perhaps I can take f_n(t) = n * sin(n pi t), which is continuous and bounded by n. Then F_n(x) = integral from 0 to x of f_n(t) dt. The integral of sin(n pi t) from 0 to x is [ -cos(n pi t)/(n pi) ) ] from 0 to x, which is (cos(n pi x) - 1)/(n pi). So F_n(x) = [ cos(n pi x) - 1 ] / (n pi ). As n increases, F_n(x) tends to zero for each x because of the 1/n factor. So F_n converges pointwise to zero. But does it converge uniformly? Let's check the sup norm. The maximum of |F_n(x)| occurs where cos(n pi x) is -1, so the maximum is ( -1 -1 )/(n pi ) = -2/(n pi ), so absolute value is 2/(n pi ), which goes to zero as n increases. So F_n converges uniformly to zero. So in this case, the sequence F_n has a convergent subsequence (itself) converging to zero.

Wait, but that's just one example. I need to think if every sequence in F has a convergent subsequence in F.

Alternatively, perhaps F is not sequentially compact because, for example, we can find a sequence where the derivatives (f_n) are getting wilder and wilder, but their integrals don't settle down.

Wait, another example: Let f_n(t) = sin(n^2 t). These are bounded by 1, so each f_n is in M. Then F_n(x) = integral from 0 to x of sin(n^2 t) dt. The integral is [ -cos(n^2 x) / (n^2) ) + 1/(n^2) ]. So F_n(x) = (1 - cos(n^2 x)) / (n^2 ). As n increases, F_n(x) tends to zero uniformly because 1 - cos(n^2 x) is bounded by 2, so F_n(x) is bounded by 2/(n^2 ), which goes to zero. So again, F_n converges to zero.

Hmm, maybe I'm not choosing the right example. Let's think differently. Suppose I take f_n(t) = n * t (1 - t), which is a continuous function on [0,1], and its maximum is n/4 when t=1/2. So f_n is in M, and its sup is n/4, which goes to infinity as n increases. Then F_n(x) = integral from 0 to x of n t (1 - t) dt. Let's compute that:

Integral of n t (1 - t) dt from 0 to x is n ∫ t - t^2 dt = n [ (t^2)/2 - (t^3)/3 ] from 0 to x = n [ x²/2 - x³/3 ].

So F_n(x) = n (x²/2 - x³/3 ). Let's see what happens as n increases. The function F_n(x) is a polynomial scaled by n. The maximum of F_n occurs where the derivative is zero. The derivative F_n’(x) = n (x - x² ). Setting to zero, x=0 or x=1. So at x=1, F_n(1)=n (1/2 - 1/3 )=n (1/6 ). So F_n(1) =n/6, which goes to infinity as n increases. So F_n(x) is a function whose maximum value grows without bound as n increases. So the sequence F_n is not bounded in the sup norm, meaning it can't have a convergent subsequence in C[0,1], because their sup norms are blowing up. Thus, this sequence F_n doesn't have a convergent subsequence in F, implying that F is not sequentially compact.

Wait, but wait: The set F is defined as the set of all F(x) = integral from 0 to x of f(t) dt where f is in M. So F is a subset of C^1[0,1]. But as shown, there exists a sequence F_n in F such that the sup norm of F_n tends to infinity. Therefore, F is not bounded in C[0,1], so it's not a compact set. Thus, it's not sequentially compact either.

So the answer to the first question is no, F is not sequentially compact. So the first part of the answer is 0.

Now, the second part asks which theorem can be used to prove this. The options are Arzelà-Ascoli, Riesz representation, Banach fixed point, or none.

We initially thought about Arzelà-Ascoli, but realized that F isn't uniformly bounded or equicontinuous, so Arzelà-Ascoli doesn't apply. Alternatively, maybe another approach, but the question is which theorem can be used to prove whether F is compact.

Wait, but since F is not compact, perhaps the Arzelà-Ascoli isn't applicable. So the correct choice would be 'none of the above' because neither Arzelà-Ascoli nor the others apply to show compactness. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, but Arzelà-Ascoli is used to determine compactness in C[0,1]. So if F isn't uniformly bounded or equicontinuous, then by Arzelà-Ascoli, F is not compact. So perhaps the answer is that F is not compact, and this can be shown using Arzelà-Ascoli's theorem (by showing the conditions fail). So the second part's answer would be 1 (Arzelà-Ascoli). 

But wait, in the problem statement, the set F is defined as F(x) = integral from 0 to x of f(t) dt where f is in M. So F is a set of functions, and to check its compactness, we can use Arzelà-Ascoli. Since F isn't uniformly bounded nor equicontinuous, then by Arzelà-Ascoli, it's not compact. So the answer would be [0,1], which is option D.

Wait, but earlier I thought that each F is bounded by the sup of f, but each F can have a different sup. So the set F is not uniformly bounded, and not equicontinuous. So Arzelà-Ascoli tells us that F is not compact, so we can use that theorem to prove it's not compact. So the second part's answer is 1 (Arzelà-Ascoli).

Therefore, the two answers are [0,1], which is option D.

To determine whether the set \( F = \{ F(x) = \int_0^x f(t) \, dt \mid f \in M \} \), where \( M \) is the set of bounded functions in \( C[0,1] \), is sequentially compact, we analyze the properties of \( F \) in the context of the Arzelà-Ascoli theorem. 

### Key Analysis:
1. **Sequential Compactness and Arzelà-Ascoli Theorem**:
   - A set of functions is sequentially compact if every sequence within the set has a convergent subsequence that also lies within the set.
   - The Arzelà-Ascoli theorem states that a subset of \( C[0,1] \) is compact (and hence sequentially compact) if and only if it is uniformly bounded and equicontinuous.

2. **Uniform Boundedness**:
   - Each \( F(x) = \int_0^x f(t) \, dt \) is bounded because \( f \) is bounded. However, the bound on \( F(x) \) depends on the bound of \( f \), and since \( f \) can have different bounds for different functions, \( F \) is not uniformly bounded across all its elements.

3. **Equicontinuity**:
   - Equicontinuity requires that for every \( \epsilon > 0 \), there exists a \( \delta > 0 \) such that \( |x - y| < \delta \) implies \( |F(x) - F(y)| < \epsilon \) for all \( F \in F \). Since \( F'(x) = f(x) \), and \( f \) can have different bounds, the Lipschitz constants for \( F \) are not uniform. Thus, \( F \) is not equicontinuous.

4. **Conclusion on Compactness**:
   - Since \( F \) is neither uniformly bounded nor equicontinuous, the Arzelà-Ascoli theorem implies that \( F \) is not compact. Therefore, \( F \) is not sequentially compact.

5. **Relevance of Other Theorems**:
   - The Riesz representation theorem and the Banach fixed point theorem are not directly applicable to determining the sequential compactness of \( F \). Thus, "none of the above" does not apply, as the Arzelà-Ascoli theorem is sufficient to analyze the compactness of \( F \).

### Final Answer:
The set \( F \) is not sequentially compact, and this can be shown using the Arzelà-Ascoli theorem. Therefore, the answers are:

\[
[0, 1]
\]

This corresponds to option **D**.
