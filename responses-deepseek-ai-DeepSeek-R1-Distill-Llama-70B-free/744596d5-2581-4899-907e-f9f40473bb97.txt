Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The teacher buys some folders—red and blue. I need to find out the total number and which option is closest.

Alright, the problem says 5 boxes of red folders, each with 36 folders. And 6 boxes of blue folders, each with 32. So I guess I need to calculate the total for each color and then add them together.

Let me start with the red folders. There are 5 boxes, each with 36. So 5 multiplied by 36. Hmm, what's 5 times 36? Well, 5 times 30 is 150, and 5 times 6 is 30, so adding those gives 180. So red folders total 180.

Now the blue ones. 6 boxes with 32 each. So 6 times 32. Let's see, 6 times 30 is 180, and 6 times 2 is 12. So 180 plus 12 is 192. So blue folders are 192.

Wait, but wait, let me double-check. 32 times 6. Yeah, 32+32 is 64 for two boxes, so 64 times 3 is 192. Yep, that's correct.

Now I need to add the red and blue totals together. So 180 plus 192. Let me add 180 + 190 first, which is 370, and then add the remaining 2, making it 372. So the total number of folders is 372.

Now I look at the options. The options are A:460, B:340, C:500, D:520, E:600, F:440, G:275, H:550, I:420, J:380.

Wait, the options don't have 372. So I need to find which is closest. Let's see, 372 is between 340 and 380, but closer to 380 maybe? Or maybe 360s? Let's check the options again.

Wait, the options are A:460, B:340, C:500, D:520, E:600, F:440, G:275, H:550, I:420, J:380.

Hmm, 372 is 372. Let's see the options: 340 is B, which is 32 away. 380 is J, which is 8 away. So 372 is closer to 380 than to 340. So the closest option would be J:380.

Wait, but wait, maybe I should check my calculations again to be sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's recalculate.

Red: 5 boxes ×36 = 180. Blue:6×32=192. Total 180+192=372. Yep, that seems right.

So the options are looking for the closest number. 372 is 8 less than 380, which is option J. Alternatively, 372 is 28 more than 340 (B), but that's a bigger difference. So yes, J is the closest.

The teacher buys 5 boxes of red folders (36 each) and 6 boxes of blue folders (32 each). Calculating the totals:

- Red folders: \(5 \times 36 = 180\)
- Blue folders: \(6 \times 32 = 192\)
- Total folders: \(180 + 192 = 372\)

The closest option to 372 is **380**, which corresponds to option J.
