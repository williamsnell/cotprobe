Question:

After being severely beaten and sustaining a gunshot wound to the abdomen, a 42-year-old woman undergoes resection of a perforated small bowel. During the operation, plastic reconstruction of facial fractures, and open reduction and internal fixation of the left femur are also done. Thirty-six hours postoperatively, she is awake but not completely alert. She is receiving intravenous morphine via a patient-controlled pump. She says that she needs the morphine to treat her pain, but she is worried that she is becoming addicted. She has no history of substance use disorder. She drinks one to two glasses of wine weekly. Which of the following initial actions by the physician is most appropriate?

Options:

A: Advise her to drink more wine to help with the pain
B: Maintain the morphine, but periodically administer intravenous naloxone
C: Switch the patient to oral acetaminophen as soon as she can take medication orally
D: Recommend a consultation with a psychiatrist to address her fears of addiction
E: Suggest biofeedback therapy to control pain
F: Switch the patient to intramuscular lorazepam
G: Reassure the patient that her chance of becoming addicted to narcotics is minuscule
H: Administer methadone as an alternative to morphine
I: Increase the dose of morphine to relieve her anxiety
J: Encourage the patient to endure the pain without medication to prevent addiction

Okay, so I've got this medical question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read it carefully. 

The scenario is about a 42-year-old woman who's been through a lot. She was severely beaten, had a gunshot wound to the abdomen, and underwent several surgeriesâ€”resection of a perforated small bowel, facial fracture reconstruction, and fixation of her left femur. Now, 36 hours after the operation, she's awake but not completely alert. She's on IV morphine via a patient-controlled pump. She's worried about getting addicted to morphine because she's using it for pain, but she doesn't have a history of substance use disorder. She drinks a little wine each week, so she's not a heavy user.

The question is asking what the physician should do initially. The options are A to J, each suggesting a different action.

Hmm, so the main issue here is her concern about addiction. She's using morphine as prescribed for acute postoperative pain, but she's worried. I remember that in medical settings, especially post-surgery, addiction rates are low, especially in patients without a prior history of substance abuse. So her risk is probably very low.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Advise more wine. That doesn't seem right. Alcohol isn't a good alternative for pain management, especially in a hospital setting. Plus, she's already using morphine, so adding more alcohol could be risky.

Option B: Maintain morphine and give naloxone periodically. Wait, naloxone is an opioid antagonist. But she's on morphine for pain. Giving naloxone would reverse the effects of morphine, which would be counterproductive because she needs pain relief. So that's probably not a good idea.

Option C: Switch to oral acetaminophen as soon as possible. Acetaminophen is less potent than morphine. She's just had major surgeries, so her pain is probably severe. Switching too early might leave her in pain, which isn't good. Plus, she's not even taking oral meds yet, so that might not be feasible.

Option D: Consult a psychiatrist. Her fear is about addiction. While it's a psychological concern, is a psychiatrist necessary right away? Maybe, but I think reassuring her might be the first step before involving another specialist.

Option E: Suggest biofeedback. That's a non-pharmacological approach, but she's in acute pain post-op. Biofeedback might help, but it's probably not the immediate solution. She needs effective pain management now.

Option F: Switch to IM lorazepam. Lorazepam is a benzodiazepine, used for anxiety. It doesn't treat pain, so that's not appropriate here. Plus, mixing it with morphine could cause respiratory issues.

Option G: Reassure her that the chance of addiction is minuscule. This makes sense. She has no history of substance abuse, and she's using it as directed for acute pain. Studies show that the risk is very low in such cases, so reassuring her would address her fears without changing her treatment unnecessarily.

Option H: Administer methadone. Methadone is another opioid, but it's usually for chronic pain or opioid maintenance. She's in acute pain, so methadone isn't the first choice here.

Option I: Increase morphine dose to relieve anxiety. Wait, morphine is for pain, not anxiety. If she's anxious, maybe an anxiolytic would be better, but increasing the opioid could cause more side effects and doesn't address the root cause of her anxiety, which is fear of addiction.

Option J: Encourage enduring pain without meds. That's unethical. Pain management is important for recovery. Allowing her to suffer would hinder healing and increase stress.

So putting it all together, the best initial action is to reassure her. Her fear is understandable, but the risk is low. So option G seems correct.

The patient is a 42-year-old woman recovering from major surgeries, including resection of a perforated small bowel, facial fracture reconstruction, and femur fixation. She is receiving intravenous morphine via a patient-controlled pump for acute postoperative pain but expresses concern about becoming addicted, despite having no history of substance use disorder and only occasional alcohol use. The physician must address her concerns while ensuring effective pain management.

- **Option A** (advise more wine) is inappropriate, as alcohol is not a suitable alternative for pain management in this setting.  
- **Option B** (maintain morphine with periodic naloxone) is counterproductive, as naloxone would reverse morphine's effects, undermining pain relief.  
- **Option C** (switch to oral acetaminophen) is premature, as her pain is likely severe and acetaminophen is less potent than morphine.  
- **Option D** (recommend a psychiatrist) may be unnecessary initially, as her concerns can likely be addressed with reassurance.  
- **Option E** (biofeedback therapy) is not an immediate solution for acute pain.  
- **Option F** (switch to lorazepam) is inappropriate, as it does not address pain and could complicate her treatment.  
- **Option G** (reassure her about the low risk of addiction) is the most appropriate initial response, as her risk of addiction is minuscule given her lack of substance use history and the acute setting.  
- **Option H** (methadone) is not indicated for acute pain.  
- **Option I** (increase morphine for anxiety) is misguided, as morphine is for pain, not anxiety.  
- **Option J** (encourage enduring pain) is unethical and harmful to her recovery.  

The best initial action is to reassure the patient that her risk of addiction is very low, addressing her fears without altering her effective pain management.
