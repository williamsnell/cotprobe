Question:

The secondarily altricial condition of modern human babies may have been an evolutionary solution, in that:

Options:

A: it resulted in babies being born with fully formed teeth.
B: it allowed for subsequent growth of the brain, since bipedalism had resulted in a narrowed birth canal in the female pelvis.
C: it led to an increase in the size of the newborn's head, allowing for a larger brain.
D: the brain size of hominids had not grown for more than a million years, making it difficult for babies to walk.
E: it allowed babies to be born with an instinctive ability to swim.
F: it allowed for an earlier development of language skills in babies.
G: it allowed for bipedalism and independence from the mother at an earlier age.
H: it allowed for growth of the brain to nearly adult size prior to birth, since bipedalism had resulted in a wider birth canal in the female pelvis.
I: it allowed for the development of advanced motor skills at an earlier age.
J: it led to an increase in the gestation period allowing for the brain to fully develop before birth.

Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about the evolutionary reason behind the secondarily altricial condition of human babies. Let me think this through step by step.

First, I need to understand what "secondarily altricial" means. From what I remember, altricial refers to animals that are born in a relatively immature state and require extensive parental care. Humans are secondarily altricial, meaning this trait evolved later, as opposed to being present from the very beginning.

The question is asking why this condition was an evolutionary solution. So I'm looking for a reason that explains how this trait provided a survival advantage.

Let me go through the options one by one.

Option A: It resulted in babies being born with fully formed teeth. I don't think that's right. Human babies are born without teeth, and their first teeth start coming in months later. So A is probably incorrect.

Option B: Allowed for subsequent growth of the brain because bipedalism narrowed the birth canal. Hmm, this sounds familiar. I remember that bipedalism changed the female pelvis structure, making the birth canal narrower. If the baby's brain is too big at birth, it might not pass through. So being born altricial allows the brain to continue growing after birth. That makes sense because human brains develop a lot postnatally.

Option C: Led to a larger head at birth for a bigger brain. Wait, no, because a larger head would have more difficulty passing through the birth canal. So this seems contradictory. The baby's head is relatively large, but maybe not as large as if it were born more developed. So C might not be the right choice.

Option D: Brain size hadn't grown for a million years, making it hard for babies to walk. That doesn't seem right. Brain size in hominids was increasing, not stagnant. Plus, walking and brain size are related, but I don't think this is the reason for altriciality. So D is probably wrong.

Option E: Allowed babies to swim instinctively. I don't recall any major theories linking human altriciality to swimming abilities. This seems unrelated. E might not be correct.

Option F: Earlier development of language skills. I think language skills develop after birth as the brain grows, but I'm not sure how altriciality directly caused that. Also, the question is about why it was an evolutionary solution, not about the outcomes after birth. So F might not be the best choice.

Option G: Allowed bipedalism and earlier independence. Wait, being altricial means babies are more dependent, not independent. So G seems contradictory. Human babies are quite dependent, so this doesn't fit.

Option H: Brain growth to adult size before birth due to wider birth canal. No, because bipedalism actually narrowed the birth canal. So H is incorrect because it states the opposite.

Option I: Earlier development of motor skills. Again, altricial animals are less developed at birth, so motor skills would develop later, not earlier. So I is incorrect.

Option J: Longer gestation for brain development before birth. Wait, but if the brain couldn't develop fully before birth because of the narrow pelvis, being altricial allows it to finish developing after birth. So J might not be right because it suggests the brain develops before birth, which might not be possible.

Putting it all together, the key idea is that bipedalism led to a narrower pelvis, so babies have to be born earlier in their development. This allows the brain to continue growing after birth without the constraints of the birth canal. So the correct answer should explain that.

Looking back at option B, it says it allowed for subsequent growth of the brain because bipedalism narrowed the birth canal. That fits perfectly. So the answer should be B.

The secondarily altricial condition of modern human babies refers to their birth in a relatively immature state, requiring extensive parental care. This trait evolved as an evolutionary solution to challenges posed by bipedalism. Bipedalism led to structural changes in the female pelvis, narrowing the birth canal. If human babies were born with fully developed brains, their large head size would make passing through the birth canal difficult. The altricial condition allows babies to be born with a smaller head size, enabling them to pass through the narrowed birth canal, while their brains continue to grow and develop after birth. This explains why the correct answer is:

B: it allowed for subsequent growth of the brain, since bipedalism had resulted in a narrowed birth canal in the female pelvis.

Answer: B
