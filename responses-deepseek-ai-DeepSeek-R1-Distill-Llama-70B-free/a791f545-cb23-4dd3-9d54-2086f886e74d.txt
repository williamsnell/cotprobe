Question:

Police were conducting a house-to-house search for an escaped convict. During the search, a police officer went to a home and rang the doorbell. When a teenage male opened the door, the police officer told him that a convict had escaped and asked if he had seen anyone suspicious in the neighborhood. The teenager said he hadn't but then asked the police officer to come inside to ensure the house was safe. The police officer entered the home and proceeded to look around. When he went into the kitchen, the police officer noticed a bag containing white powder on the counter. Suspecting that the bag contained narcotics, the police officer questioned the teenager as to its contents. The teenager said he didn't live in the house and had never seen it before. The police officer confiscated the bag and took the teenager to the station house for questioning, at which time it was determined that the teenager had escaped from a psychiatric hospital and had broken into the home earlier in the day. Furthermore, the results of a police lab test found that the bag contained heroin. As a result, the police issued an arrest warrant for the owner of the home. He was apprehended and charged with possession of heroin. The homeowner's attorney has filed a motion to suppress, claiming that the heroin confiscated by the police was unlawfully obtained. The motion should be

Options:

A: denied, because the teenager gave consent for the police officer to enter and search the home.
B: denied, because the police officer reasonably believed that he had permission to enter the dwelling and reasonably believed that the teenager was competent to give consent.
C: granted, because the teenager did not have an ownership or shared occupancy interest in the premises.
D: denied, because the police officer reasonably believed that he had permission to enter the dwelling.
E: denied, because the police officer was invited into the home by the teenager.
F: granted, because the police officer did not have a warrant to search the house.
G: granted, because the police officer did not have probable cause to search the house.
H: denied, because the police officer suspected that the bag contained narcotics.
I: granted, because the homeowner was not present during the search.
J: granted, because the teenager did not have the authority to consent to a search of the house.

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about a legal scenario involving police search and seizure. I'm a bit rusty on my Fourth Amendment stuff, but let me think through this step by step.

So, the situation is that police are searching for an escaped convict. They go to a home, and a teenage male answers. The officer tells him about the convict and asks if he's seen anyone suspicious. The teen says no, then invites the officer inside to check if the house is safe. The officer enters, looks around, finds a bag of white powder in the kitchen, questions the teen, confiscates the bag, and takes the teen in. Later, they find out the teen had escaped from a psychiatric hospital and broke into the home. The bag tests positive for heroin, so they charge the homeowner.

The homeowner's attorney is moving to suppress the evidence, saying it was unlawfully obtained. The question is whether the motion should be granted or denied.

I remember that for a search to be legal without a warrant, there needs to be consent. But consent has to be given by someone with the authority to do so. Who can consent? Generally, the owner or someone with a possessory interest in the premises. Also, the person giving consent must have the right to be present at the place being searched.

In this case, the person who let the officer in is a teenager who doesn't live there and had broken in. So, he's a trespasser. Therefore, he doesn't have the authority to consent to a search of the home. Because he didn't own the place or have permission to be there, his consent is invalid.

Wait, but some might argue that the officer reasonably believed the teen had authority. But the facts say the teen told the officer he didn't live there when questioned about the bag. So, the officer might not have known that at the time of entry, but when he found the bag, the teen admitted he didn't live there. But the entry itself was based on the teen's invitation. If the teen had no authority to let the officer in, then the entry was unlawful, making any evidence found inadmissible.

So, the key issue is whether the consent was valid. If the person consenting lacks authority, the search is invalid, and the evidence should be suppressed.

Looking at the options:

Option C says the motion should be granted because the teen didn't have ownership or shared occupancy. That seems correct.

Option J also says granted because the teen didn't have authority to consent. That's similar to C.

Wait, what's the difference between C and J? Let me read the options again.

Option C: Granted, because the teenager did not have an ownership or shared occupancy interest.

Option J: Granted, because the teenager did not have the authority to consent.

Hmm. Both seem correct, but I think the precise reasoning is about authority. So maybe J is the better answer because it's about the authority to consent.

Wait, but what about the officer's reasonable belief? If the officer didn't know the teen was a trespasser, maybe he thought the teen lived there. But in this case, the teen told the officer he didn't live there when questioned about the bag, which was after the officer had already entered. So when the officer entered, he might have reasonably believed the teen was a resident because the teen opened the door and invited him in. But if the teen didn't have authority, does the officer's reasonable belief matter?

I think the case law here is that if the officer has a reasonable belief that the person consenting has authority, then the consent is valid even if it later turns out they didn't. But in this case, when the officer entered, the teen said he didn't live there only after the officer found the bag. So the officer entered based on the teen's invitation, but at the time, the officer didn't know the teen wasn't a resident.

Wait, the initial invitation was when the teen opened the door and asked the officer to come in to check the house's safety. The officer didn't know he was a trespasser until later. So the officer's belief that the teen had authority was reasonable at the time of entry. But the teen didn't actually have authority, so does that make the consent invalid regardless of the officer's belief?

I'm a bit confused here. I remember the case of Illinois v. Rodriguez, where the Supreme Court held that the crucial factor is whether the officer reasonably believed that the person had authority to consent. If the officer's belief was reasonable, the evidence isn't suppressed, even if the person actually lacked authority.

In this case, the officer might have reasonably believed the teen lived there because the teen opened the door and invited him in. Unless there were obvious signs that the teen was a trespasser, which isn't indicated here, the officer's belief would be reasonable.

Wait, but the correct answer would depend on whether the officer's reasonable belief is sufficient. If so, then the consent was valid, and the motion to suppress would be denied. But if the teen didn't have authority, regardless of the officer's belief, then the consent is invalid.

So, which is it? I think under Rodriguez, the officer's reasonable belief is what matters. So if the officer had no reason to doubt the teen's authority, the search is valid.

In this scenario, the officer went to the home, the teen opened the door, and invited him in. There's no indication the officer knew or should have known the teen didn't live there. So the officer's entry based on consent would be valid, making the search lawful.

If that's the case, then the motion to suppress would be denied. Let me look at the options again.

Option B: Denied because the officer reasonably believed he had permission and the teen was competent to consent.

Option D: Denied because the officer reasonably believed he had permission.

Option E: Denied because the teen invited him.

Option C and J suggest granting because of lack of authority.

So, if the officer's reasonable belief is enough, then the correct answer is B, D, or E. But I think the key point is whether the officer's belief that the teen had authority was reasonable.

In this case, since the teen opened the door and invited the officer in, it's reasonable to believe he had authority. So the consent was valid, and the search was lawful. Therefore, the motion to suppress should be denied.

Wait, but the teen was a trespasser and didn't live there. So his consent was invalid, but the officer didn't know that. So under Rodriguez, the evidence would still be admissible because the officer's belief was reasonable.

Therefore, the correct answer would be B or D. Let me check the options.

Option B says the officer reasonably believed he had permission and the teen was competent. Competency might relate to the teen's age, but the question doesn't indicate the teen's age as an issue beyond being a teenager. So maybe B is stretching it with the competency part. Alternatively, D says the officer reasonably believed he had permission, which is sufficient.

So, I think the correct answer is B or D. But wait, in Rodriguez, the Court emphasized the apparent authority, not the actual authority. So if the officer had no reason to question the teen's authority, the consent is valid.

Therefore, the motion to suppress should be denied. So looking at the options, B and D are possibilities.

Option B: Denied because the officer reasonably believed he had permission and the teen was competent.

But does the teen's competency matter here? The teenager is old enough to answer the door and give consent. Unless he's mentally incapacitated, which isn't indicated, his competency isn't in question. The issue is his authority, not competency.

So perhaps the better option is B because it mentions both permission and competency, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe D is better because it only addresses the permission aspect.

Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is B because it covers both the belief in permission and the teen's competency to consent.

Wait, but the scenario doesn't mention anything about the teen's mental state except that he escaped from a psychiatric hospital. But that's only revealed later. At the time of the search, the officer didn't know that. So the officer had no reason to doubt the teen's competency. Therefore, the officer's reasonable belief that the teen was competent and had authority is sufficient.

So, option B seems to cover both aspects, which aligns with the Rodriguez standard.

Therefore, the motion should be denied, so the correct answer is B.

The scenario involves a police officer entering a home after being invited by a teenager who later turned out to be a trespasser. The officer found heroin in the kitchen, leading to the homeowner's arrest. The homeowner's attorney filed a motion to suppress, arguing that the evidence was unlawfully obtained. The key issue is whether the teenager's consent to enter and search the home was valid under the Fourth Amendment.

For consent to be valid, the person giving consent must have authority over the premises, such as an ownership or possessory interest. Additionally, the officer's reasonable belief in the person's authority is critical, as established by *Illinois v. Rodriguez*. In this case, the teenager lacked authority because he was a trespasser, but the officer had no reason to doubt the teenager's authority at the time of entry. The teenager opened the door, invited the officer in, and there were no obvious signs of trespassing. Therefore, the officer's reasonable belief that the teenager had authority to consent makes the search lawful under *Rodriguez*.

Option B is the most accurate because it addresses both the officer's reasonable belief in the teenager's permission and the teenager's competency to consent. While the teenager lacked actual authority, the officer's belief was reasonable based on the circumstances.

ANSWER: B
