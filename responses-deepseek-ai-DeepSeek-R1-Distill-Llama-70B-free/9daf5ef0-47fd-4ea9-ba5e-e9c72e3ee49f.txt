Okay, so I've got this math problem here about Albert Morgan who sells C.B. radios. The question is asking how much he earned this week. Hmm, let's see. I remember that commission means he gets a percentage of his sales as his earnings. Oh right, he works on a straight 5% commission basis. So I think that means he gets 5% of whatever he sells.

His sales this week were $3,500. So I need to calculate 5% of $3,500. Wait, how do I do that again? Oh yeah, percentage calculations. To find a percentage of a number, you multiply the percentage (as a decimal) by the number. So 5% is 0.05 in decimal form.

Let me write that down. 5% of $3,500 is 0.05 * 3500. Let me do the multiplication. 0.05 times 3500. Hmm, 0.05 is the same as 5 cents on the dollar, so for every $100, he'd get $5. But let's compute it properly.

3500 times 0.05. Let's break it down. 3500 divided by 100 is 35, and 35 multiplied by 5 is 175. So 0.05 * 3500 equals $175. So Albert earned $175 this week.

Looking back at the options, option D is $175.00. So the correct answer should be D.
