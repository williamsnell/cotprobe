Okay, so I have this problem about gasoline expansion and I need to figure it out. Let me think through it step by step.

The setup is that there's a 20-gallon gas tank filled exactly to the top at 0°F. Then the car is parked in a garage that's 70°F. I need to find out how much gasoline is lost due to expansion when the temperature rises. The coefficient of volume expansion for gasoline is given as 0.0012 per degree Celsius.

Hmm, right. So thermal expansion, volume expansion. I remember that the formula for volume expansion is ΔV = βV ΔT, where β is the coefficient, V is the original volume, and ΔT is the change in temperature.

Wait, but the temperatures here are in Fahrenheit, right? 0°F to 70°F. So I need to convert that temperature change to Celsius because the β is given per °C.

How do I convert Fahrenheit to Celsius for the temperature change? Oh right, the size of a degree Celsius is the same as a degree Fahrenheit in terms of temperature intervals, but the starting points are different. So a change of 1°F is equivalent to a change of 1°C in terms of size, but I need to convert the actual numerical value.

Wait, wait. No, that's not correct. The temperature change in Celsius isn't the same as Fahrenheit. Let's think: the conversion formula between °C and °F is C = (F - 32) * 5/9. But when it comes to a temperature change (ΔT), the conversion is different. Because a change of 1°F is equivalent to a change of 5/9 °C. So if ΔT in Fahrenheit is 70-0 =70°F, then in Celsius that's 70 * (5/9) °C. Let me calculate that.

70 multiplied by 5 is 350, divided by 9 is approximately 38.888... So about 38.89°C change.

Wait, wait, no. Wait a minute. Because when you're converting a temperature difference, like ΔT in °F to ΔT in °C, you multiply by 5/9. Because the size of a degree Celsius is bigger than Fahrenheit. So yes, 70°F change is 70*(5/9) ≈38.89°C.

So ΔT is approximately 38.89°C.

Now, the original volume V is 20 gallons. The coefficient β is 0.0012 per °C.

So the change in volume ΔV is β * V * ΔT.

Plugging in the numbers: 0.0012 * 20 * 38.89.

Let me calculate that. 0.0012 * 20 is 0.024. Multiply that by 38.89.

0.024 * 38.89 = Let's see. 0.024 * 40 is 0.96, but since it's 38.89, which is 1.11 less than 40. So 0.024 * (-1.11) is about -0.02664. So 0.96 - 0.02664 = 0.93336.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 0.024 * 38.89. Maybe better to calculate it directly.

38.89 * 0.024. Let's break it down:

38.89 * 0.02 = 0.7778

38.89 * 0.004 = 0.15556

Add them together: 0.7778 + 0.15556 = 0.93336 gallons.

So the volume increases by approximately 0.93336 gallons.

Wait, but the tank is filled exactly to the top. So when the gasoline expands, it will overflow. So the amount lost is this ΔV, right? Because the tank can't expand, so the excess is spilled.

So the gasoline lost is about 0.933 gallons. Looking at the options, let's see. Option G is .94 gal, which is very close. Option H is .80, which is lower. So the closest would be G.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check the ΔT. Because another approach is to convert the initial and final temperatures to Celsius and then find the difference.

Wait, initial temp is 0°F. Converting to Celsius: (0-32)*5/9 = (-32)*5/9 = -160/9 ≈-17.78°C.

Final temp is 70°F. Convert to Celsius: (70-32)*5/9 =38*5/9= 190/9 ≈21.11°C.

So ΔT is 21.11 - (-17.78) = 38.89°C. Okay, same as before. So that's correct.

So the calculation is correct. The expansion is about 0.933 gallons. So the answer should be G: 0.94 gal.

Wait, but let me make sure the formula is correct. ΔV = β V ΔT. Yes, that's right for volume expansion.

Another thing: gasoline expands more than the tank, so the excess is the loss. So yes, the loss is ΔV, which is 0.933, so 0.94 gallons. So option G.

To determine how much gasoline is lost due to expansion, we use the formula for thermal volume expansion:

\[
\Delta V = \beta V \Delta T
\]

Where:
- \( \beta = 0.0012 \, /^{\circ}C \) (coefficient of volume expansion of gasoline),
- \( V = 20 \, \text{gallons} \) (initial volume of gasoline),
- \( \Delta T \) is the temperature change in \( ^{\circ}C \).

### Step 1: Convert temperature change to Celsius
The temperature changes from \( 0^\circ F \) to \( 70^\circ F \). To convert this to Celsius:
\[
\Delta T = (70 - 0) \times \frac{5}{9} = 70 \times \frac{5}{9} \approx 38.89 \, ^{\circ}C
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the volume expansion
Using the formula:
\[
\Delta V = \beta V \Delta T = 0.0012 \times 20 \times 38.89
\]

First, calculate \( 0.0012 \times 20 = 0.024 \). Then:
\[
0.024 \times 38.89 \approx 0.93336 \, \text{gallons}
\]

### Step 3: Interpret the result
The gasoline tank is filled to the top, so the expanded volume overflows. The amount of gasoline lost is approximately \( 0.93336 \, \text{gallons} \), which rounds to \( 0.94 \, \text{gallons} \).

### Final Answer:
The closest option to the calculated value is **G: 0.94 gal**.
