Okay, so I have this problem about radiocarbon dating, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The sample is bristle cone pine wood, aged 7,000 ±100 years based on counting growth rings. But the activity given is 6.6 disintegrations per minute per gram of carbon. I need to find the exact age using radiochemical evidence. The options are from A to J.

Hmm, I remember that radiocarbon dating measures the decay of carbon-14. The standard method uses the fact that C-14 has a half-life of about 5,730 years. So, the activity is related to how much C-14 is left.

Wait, the formula I think is A = A0 * (1/2)^(t / t_half). Where A is the current activity, A0 is the initial activity, t is the time elapsed, and t_half is the half-life.

But wait, what's the initial activity? I think for living organisms, the initial activity is the same as the activity of the atmosphere when they were alive. So A0 is the activity in 1950, which is the standard. But what's that value?

Oh right, the standard is about 14 disintegrations per minute per gram of carbon. So A0 is 14 dpm/g.

So the problem gives A as 6.6 dpm/g. We can plug into the formula.

Let me rearrange the formula to solve for t. Taking natural logs on both sides: ln(A/A0) = -t / t_half. So t = -t_half * ln(A/A0).

Plugging in the numbers: A is 6.6, A0 is 14. So A/A0 is 6.6/14. Let me calculate that.

6.6 divided by 14 is approximately 0.4714.

So ln(0.4714) is... I think ln(0.5) is about -0.6931. Since 0.4714 is less than 0.5, the ln will be more negative. Let me calculate it more accurately.

Wait, 0.4714 is about e^(-0.753) maybe? Let me see: e^-0.75 is about 0.472, right? So ln(0.4714) ≈ -0.753.

So t = -5730 * (-0.753) = 5730 * 0.753.

Calculating that: 5730 * 0.75 is 4297.5, and 5730 * 0.003 is 17.19. So total is 4297.5 +17.19 = 4314.69 years.

Wait, that can't be right because the options don't have a 4,300-year-old option. Wait, did I mix up something?

Wait, the sample's age by rings is 7,000 ±100 years. So according to the rings, it's about 7,000 years old, but the radiocarbon date is different. Hmm, but my calculation gave around 4,300 years. That doesn't make sense because the options don't have that. So maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, perhaps I should have used the decay constant instead. The decay constant λ is ln(2)/t_half. So λ = 0.693 / 5730 ≈ 0.00012097 per year.

Then, the formula is N = N0 * e^(-λt). But activity A is proportional to N, so A = A0 * e^(-λt). So same as before.

Alternatively, I think I might have messed up the formula. Let me double-check.

Wait, another approach: The activity is A = A0 * (1/2)^(t/t_half). So t = t_half * log2(A0/A).

Wait, yes, because ln(1/2) is -0.693, but log base 2 of (A/A0) would be log2(6.6/14) = log2(0.4714). Since 2^-1 is 0.5, and 0.4714 is less than 0.5, so it's about -1.09. Because 2^-1.09 ≈ 0.4714.

So t = 5730 * 1.09 ≈ 5730 * 1 =5730, 5730 *0.09=516. So total is 6246 years.

Wait, but that's about 6,246 years. Let me check the options: option B is 6,225; D is 6,600. Hmm, maybe I should calculate more accurately.

Wait, let me calculate log2(6.6/14) more precisely. 6.6/14 is 0.4714. Let me compute log base 2 of 0.4714.

I know that 2^-1 = 0.5, which is 0.5. So 0.4714 is a little less than 0.5, so the exponent would be a little less than -1. Let me compute it.

Using natural log: ln(0.4714) ≈ -0.753. So log2(0.4714) = ln(0.4714) / ln(2) ≈ (-0.753)/0.6931 ≈ -1.086.

So t = 5730 * 1.086 ≈ 5730 * 1.08 = 5730 + (5730 *0.08) =5730 + 458.4=6188.4. Then 0.006 more: 5730 * 0.006 =34.38. So total t≈6188.4 +34.38≈6222.78 years.

So approximately 6,223 years. Looking at the options, option B is 6,225. That's very close.

Wait, but the sample's age is 7,000 years by tree rings. So why is the radiocarbon date about 6,225? That's a difference of about 775 years. But I thought that tree ring dating (dendrochronology) is more accurate. I guess this might be a problem with radiocarbon calibration, considering that the atmospheric C-14 levels have varied over time.

But the question asks to calculate the exact age from radiochemical evidence, not considering calibration. So the calculation is about 6,225, which is option B.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the formula should be t = (ln(A/A0)) / (ln(0.5)) * 5730. Let me compute that.

ln(0.4714) is -0.753. ln(0.5) is -0.693. So t = (-0.753) / (-0.693) ) *5730.

0.753 / 0.693 is approximately 1.0858. So 1.0858 *5730 ≈5730*1.08=6188.4 as before. So same result.

So the correct answer should be around 6,225, which is option B.

To calculate the exact age of the bristle cone pine wood sample from radiochemical evidence, we use the formula for radiocarbon dating:

\[
A = A_0 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{t / t_{\text{half}}}
\]

Where:
- \( A \) is the current activity (\( 6.6 \, \text{dpm/g} \)),
- \( A_0 \) is the initial activity (\( 14 \, \text{dpm/g} \), the standard atmospheric value),
- \( t_{\text{half}} \) is the half-life of carbon-14 (\( 5,730 \, \text{years} \)),
- \( t \) is the age of the sample.

Rearranging the formula to solve for \( t \):

\[
t = t_{\text{half}} \cdot \log_2\left(\frac{A_0}{A}\right)
\]

First, calculate the ratio \( \frac{A_0}{A} \):

\[
\frac{A_0}{A} = \frac{14}{6.6} \approx 2.121
\]

Next, compute \( \log_2(2.121) \). Using the relationship \( \log_2(x) = \frac{\ln(x)}{\ln(2)} \):

\[
\ln(2.121) \approx 0.753, \quad \ln(2) \approx 0.693
\]

\[
\log_2(2.121) = \frac{0.753}{0.693} \approx 1.086
\]

Now, calculate \( t \):

\[
t = 5,730 \cdot 1.086 \approx 6,223 \, \text{years}
\]

This result is very close to option **B: 6,225 years old**. While the sample's age from tree ring counting is \( 7,000 \pm 100 \, \text{years} \), the question specifically asks for the age based on radiochemical evidence, which does not account for calibration corrections. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**B: 6,225 years old**
