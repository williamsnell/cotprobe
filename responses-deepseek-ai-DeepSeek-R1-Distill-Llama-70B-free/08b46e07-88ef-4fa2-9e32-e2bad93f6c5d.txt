Question:

This question refers to the following information.
"I travelled thence to 'Aden, the port of Yemen, on the coast of the ocean. It is surrounded by mountains and can be approached from one side only; it has no crops, trees, or water, but has reservoirs in which rainwater is collected. The Arabs often cut off the inhabitants from their supply of drinking-water until the they buy them off with money and pieces of cloth. It is an exceedingly hot place. It is the port of the Indians, and to it come large vessels from Kinbayat [Cambay], Kawlam [Quilon], Calicut and many other Malabar ports [on the south-west coast of India]. There are Indian merchants living there, as well as Egyptian merchants. Its inhabitants are all either merchants, porters, or fishermen. Some of the merchants are immensely rich, so rich that sometimes a single merchant is sole owner of a large ship with all it contains, and this is a subject of ostentation and rivalry amongst them. In spite of that they are pious, humble, upright, and generous in character, treat strangers well, give liberally to devotees, and pay in full the tithes due to God."
Ibn Battuta, ca. 1325â€“1354 C.E.

Okay, so I've got this history question in front of me, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's break it down step by step. 

The question is about Ibn Battuta's journal entry regarding Aden. The key here is to understand what led to the economic system he described. From the text, Aden is a port city in Yemen, described as a major hub for trade with India and other regions. The city's economy seems to be based on trade, with merchants, porters, and fishermen as the main inhabitants. There are mentions of large vessels coming from various Indian ports, indicating that Aden is a significant stop in trade routes.

Now, the question is asking which factor directly led to this economic system. The options are A through J, each suggesting a different influence. 

Let me go through each option:

A: Influence of religious institutions. The journal does mention that the people are pious and pay tithes, but does that directly lead to the economic system? Maybe indirectly by shaping their social behavior, but I'm not sure it's the main driver of the trade-based economy.

B: Competition with European trade networks. The time period is around the 14th century. I know that during this time, European trade networks were just beginning to expand, especially with the Mediterranean. But Aden's trade seems more focused on the Indian Ocean and connections to India and Egypt. So maybe competition with Europeans isn't the main factor here. Plus, the text doesn't mention Europeans at all.

C: Invasion by neighboring territories. The passage doesn't talk about any invasions affecting Aden's economy. It's more about the natural setup of the port and trade activities.

D: Discovery of new trade routes. Well, Aden is an established port. The journal is from the 14th century, and trade routes in the Indian Ocean had been in place for a long time before that. So maybe not new routes, but perhaps the existing ones are the reason.

E: Meteorological phenomena. Aden is described as exceedingly hot with no water, relying on rainwater. Weather might affect how the city operates, but does it directly lead to the economic system? Maybe the lack of resources made trade essential, but I'm not sure if that's the main cause.

F: Presence of highly developed port cities. Aden itself is a port city, but this option is a bit circular. The question is about what led to its economic system, not the characteristics of the city itself.

G: Government policies promoting trade. The text doesn't mention any specific policies or governance structures. It focuses more on the merchants and the setup of the port.

H: Introduction of new crops. There's no mention of agriculture being a significant part of Aden's economy. In fact, it says there are no crops or trees because of the lack of water, so this doesn't seem relevant.

I: Technological advancements in shipbuilding. The journal mentions large vessels from various ports. Better ships could facilitate more trade, making Aden an important hub. This seems like a strong possibility because improved shipbuilding would allow for more extensive and efficient trade routes.

J: Military campaigns. There's no indication of military actions driving the economy here. The focus is more on trade and merchants.

Putting it all together, the economic system is based on trade, which relies heavily on the ability to transport goods across the seas. If there were technological advancements in shipbuilding, that would make trade more feasible, leading to the development of Aden as a major port. So option I seems like the most direct cause.

Wait, but option D is about new trade routes. I'm a bit confused between D and I. The journal doesn't specify that new routes were discovered, but it does say that Aden is the port for Indian trade, which implies established routes. So maybe it's not about new routes but the ability to use existing ones more effectively, which would point to shipbuilding technology.

Yes, I think I'm more confident now that I is the correct answer.

The economic system described in Ibn Battuta's journal is centered around Aden as a major trade hub, with merchants, porters, and fishermen driving the economy. The key factor directly leading to this system is the ability to facilitate extensive and efficient trade, which relies heavily on advancements in shipbuilding technology. These advancements would have enabled the construction of larger and more capable vessels, allowing for increased trade volume and connectivity with regions like India and Egypt. While other factors like the presence of port cities or government policies might have played a role, the journal emphasizes the importance of large vessels from various ports, making technological advancements in shipbuilding the most direct cause.
