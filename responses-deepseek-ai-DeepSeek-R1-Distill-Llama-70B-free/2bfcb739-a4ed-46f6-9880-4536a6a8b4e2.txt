Question:

Define a hormone. How would you go about proving that a particular gland is responsible for a specific function?

Options:

A: A hormone is a type of organ
B: A hormone is a type of tissue
C: A hormone is an electrical signal sent through the nervous system to communicate between different parts of the body.
D: A hormone is a mineral that is involved in maintaining the balance of water in the body.
E: A hormone is a chemical substance synthesized by a specific organ or tissue and secreted directly into the blood.
F: A hormone is a structural protein that makes up the components of muscles and tissues.
G: A hormone is a digestive enzyme that breaks down food in the stomach and intestines.
H: A hormone is a type of vitamin that the body needs in small amounts to function properly.
I: A hormone is a type of cell
J: A hormone is a biological molecule that remains within the organ it is produced in and affects only that specific organ.

Okay, so I have this question about hormones and how to prove a gland's function. Let's break it down.

First, I need to define what a hormone is. I remember from biology that hormones are chemicals. They're like messengers in the body. So looking at the options, I can eliminate some. Option A says a hormone is an organâ€”that's not right. Organs are like the heart or liver. Option B is a tissue, which is also incorrect. Tissues are groups of cells, but hormones are individual chemicals.

Option C mentions electrical signals and the nervous system. Oh wait, that's more about neurotransmitters, not hormones. Hormones are part of the endocrine system, which uses blood to transport them, not electrical signals through nerves. So C is out.

Option D talks about minerals and water balance. That sounds more like electrolytes, such as sodium or potassium, not hormones. So D isn't right either.

Option E says a hormone is a chemical made by an organ or tissue and secreted into the blood. That rings a bell. I think that's the correct definition. Hormones are indeed chemicals, like insulin or adrenaline, made by glands (which are organs) and released into the bloodstream to affect other parts.

Option F describes structural proteins for muscles. That's like actin or myosin, not hormones. So F is incorrect.

Option G refers to digestive enzymes. Enzymes like amylase or lipase break down food, which is a different system. So G is wrong.

Option H is about vitamins. Vitamins are nutrients, not hormones. So H isn't it.

Option I says a hormone is a cell type. No, hormones are produced by cells, but they themselves are molecules, not cells. So I is wrong.

Option J claims hormones stay within the organ and affect only that organ. That's not right because hormones travel through the blood to reach target organs or cells elsewhere in the body. So J is incorrect.

So the first part of the question is best answered by option E.

Now the second part: proving a gland is responsible for a specific function. How would I approach that? I think it involves experiments where you remove the gland and see if the function is lost, then maybe add back the hormone to see if it restores the function.

For example, if I think the thyroid gland controls metabolism, I could remove the thyroid from an animal and observe if metabolism slows down. Then, administering thyroid hormones should bring metabolism back to normal if the gland is indeed responsible.

Alternatively, another method is to observe the effects when the gland is present versus when it's not. Or maybe using radioactive tracers to see where the hormone goes and what it affects.

So the steps would be something like:
1. Remove or disable the gland.
2. Observe any changes in function.
3. Administer the suspected hormone and see if the function returns.
4. Confirm that the hormone is coming from the gland.

I think this is similar to the classic experiments done with insulin and the pancreas. Scientists removed the pancreas and observed the effects, then isolated insulin and administered it to see the changes.

So putting it all together, the correct answer for the definition is E, and the method to prove the gland's function would involve these experimental steps.

To answer the question:

1. **Definition of a hormone**: A hormone is a chemical substance synthesized by a specific organ or tissue and secreted directly into the blood. This is correctly described by option **E**.

2. **Proving a gland is responsible for a specific function**: This can be done through experimental methods such as:
   - Removing the gland and observing the loss of function.
   - Administering the suspected hormone to see if the function is restored.
   - Using techniques like radioactive tracers to track the hormone's effects.

The correct answer is **E**.

Answer: E
