Okay, so I've got this problem here about John Backus paying back a loan to the Third National Bank. The question is asking me to find out how much he borrowed initially. Let's see, the payment he's making is $342.65 on July 1, and the interest is $17.25. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on these kinds of problems, but I'll try to think it through.

So, I remember that when you borrow money, the amount you pay back includes both the principal (the amount you borrowed) and the interest. So the total payment is principal plus interest. So in this case, John is paying $342.65, which is the total of the principal and the interest of $17.25. So I think the formula would be: Total Payment = Principal + Interest.

Wait, let me make sure. So if the interest is $17.25, then the principal (the amount he borrowed) must be the total payment minus the interest. So, Principal = Total Payment - Interest.

Let me plug in the numbers. The total payment is $342.65, and the interest is $17.25. So subtracting those, 342.65 minus 17.25. Let me calculate that. 342.65 minus 17.25. Well, 342.65 minus 17 is 325.65, and then minus 0.25 more would be 325.40. So the principal would be $325.40.

Looking at the options, I see option J is $325.40. So that must be the correct answer. Wait, but let me double-check in case I made a mistake. Sometimes I mix up which way to calculate it. So the interest is the amount paid on top of the principal. So yes, the principal is the amount borrowed before interest. So John paid back the principal plus the interest, so subtracting the interest from the total gives the principal.

Another way to think about it: If he borrowed $325.40 and the interest is $17.25, adding them together gives 325.40 +17.25 = 342.65, which matches the payment he made. So yes, that makes sense. So the correct answer should be J.

The amount John Backus borrowed is calculated by subtracting the interest from the total payment. Using the formula:

\[
\text{Principal} = \text{Total Payment} - \text{Interest}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\text{Principal} = \$342.65 - \$17.25 = \$325.40
\]

This matches option J. 

Answer: J
