Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about finding the mechanical equivalent of heat, which is the value of J. Hmm, I remember that J is the number of joules equivalent to one calorie. The problem gives me a bunch of data from an experiment, and I need to calculate J using that data. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I think I should recall the formula that relates all these quantities. The basic idea is that the electrical energy provided to the coil is converted into heat, which then raises the temperature of the water and the calorimeter. So the electrical energy should equal the heat gained by the water plus the heat gained by the calorimeter.

The formula for heat is Q = mcΔT, right? Where m is mass, c is specific heat, and ΔT is the change in temperature. Since there are two things heating up (water and calorimeter), I'll calculate each separately and then add them together.

Wait, but wait, the calorimeter's specific heat is given in cal/(gm°C), and the water's specific heat is probably 1 cal/(gm°C) because that's standard, right? So for the water, Q_water = m_water * c_water * ΔT. And for the calorimeter, Q_calorimeter = m_calorimeter * c_calorimeter * ΔT. Then total heat Q_total is Q_water + Q_calorimeter.

But wait, the electrical energy is in joules, and the heat is in calories. So I'll need to convert one to the other, which is where J comes in. Because J is the number of joules per calorie, so the total electrical energy in joules will be equal to the total heat in calories multiplied by J. So E = Q_total * J.

Wait, let me make sure. Electrical energy E is power multiplied by time. Power is voltage squared divided by resistance. So E = (V^2 / R) * t. But time is in minutes, so I need to convert that to seconds because the SI unit of time is seconds. Oh right, because 1 Watt is 1 Joule per second.

So let's jot down all the given values:

Resistance R = 55 ohms
Voltage V = 110 volts
Mass of water m_water = 153 gm
Mass of calorimeter m_cal = 60 gm
Specific heat of calorimeter c_cal = 0.10 cal/(gm°C)
Time t = 1.25 min → convert to seconds. 1 min is 60 sec, so 1.25 *60 =75 seconds.
Initial temp T_initial =10.0°C
Final temp T_final=35.0°C
So ΔT = 35 -10 =25°C.

Now, calculate E, the electrical energy:

E = (V² / R) * t
V squared is 110^2 = 12100. Divided by R=55 → 12100/55 = 220. Then multiply by time t=75 sec → 220 *75 = 16500 joules. So E =16500 J.

Now calculate the heat absorbed. The water's specific heat is 1 cal/(gm°C), so Q_water =153 gm *1 cal/(gm°C) *25°C = 153*25 = 3825 cal.

The calorimeter's Q is mass * c_cal * ΔT → 60 gm *0.10 cal/(gm°C) *25°C → 60 *0.1=6, 6 *25=150 cal.

So total heat Q_total =3825 +150 = 3975 cal.

Wait, but wait, is that right? So the electrical energy in joules equals the heat in calories times J. So E = Q_total * J → 16500 J =3975 cal * J. So solving for J, J=16500 /3975.

Wait, let me compute that. 16500 divided by 3975. Let's see, 3975 *4 =15900. 16500 minus 15900 is 600. 600 divided by 3975 is about 0.151. So 4.151 approximately. So J≈4.15 J/cal.

Looking at the options, option I is 4.15. So the answer should be I.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere.

Electrical energy: V^2/R = 110^2 /55 → (12100)/55 = 220. Yes. Time in seconds is 75. So 220 *75=16500 J. Correct.

Heat from water: 153g *25°C *1 = 3825 cal. Heat from calorimeter:60g *0.1 *25=150 cal. Total 3975 cal. Correct.

So J = 16500 /3975 = let me compute that exactly. 3975 x4 is 15900. 16500-15900=600. 600/3975 → 600 ÷ 3975 = 0.15105. So J=4.15105, approximately 4.15 J/cal. So option I is correct.

To determine the value of \( J \) (the mechanical equivalent of heat), we equate the electrical energy provided to the system to the total heat absorbed by the water and the calorimeter. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Calculate the electrical energy (\( E \))**:  
   The electrical energy is given by \( E = \frac{V^2}{R} \cdot t \).  
   - Voltage (\( V \)) = 110 V, Resistance (\( R \)) = 55 \(\Omega\), Time (\( t \)) = 1.25 min = 75 s.  
   - \( E = \frac{110^2}{55} \cdot 75 = 220 \cdot 75 = 16500 \, \text{J} \).

2. **Calculate the heat absorbed by the water (\( Q_{\text{water}} \))**:  
   The heat absorbed by the water is \( Q_{\text{water}} = m_{\text{water}} \cdot c_{\text{water}} \cdot \Delta T \).  
   - Mass of water (\( m_{\text{water}} \)) = 153 g, Specific heat of water (\( c_{\text{water}} \)) = 1 \(\text{cal/(g°C)}\), Temperature change (\( \Delta T \)) = 35.0°C - 10.0°C = 25.0°C.  
   - \( Q_{\text{water}} = 153 \cdot 1 \cdot 25 = 3825 \, \text{cal} \).

3. **Calculate the heat absorbed by the calorimeter (\( Q_{\text{calorimeter}} \))**:  
   The heat absorbed by the calorimeter is \( Q_{\text{calorimeter}} = m_{\text{calorimeter}} \cdot c_{\text{calorimeter}} \cdot \Delta T \).  
   - Mass of calorimeter (\( m_{\text{calorimeter}} \)) = 60 g, Specific heat of calorimeter (\( c_{\text{calorimeter}} \)) = 0.10 \(\text{cal/(g°C)}\), Temperature change (\( \Delta T \)) = 25.0°C.  
   - \( Q_{\text{calorimeter}} = 60 \cdot 0.10 \cdot 25 = 150 \, \text{cal} \).

4. **Calculate the total heat (\( Q_{\text{total}} \))**:  
   The total heat is the sum of the heat absorbed by the water and the calorimeter:  
   - \( Q_{\text{total}} = Q_{\text{water}} + Q_{\text{calorimeter}} = 3825 + 150 = 3975 \, \text{cal} \).

5. **Relate electrical energy to heat and solve for \( J \)**:  
   The electrical energy in joules equals the total heat in calories multiplied by \( J \):  
   - \( E = Q_{\text{total}} \cdot J \).  
   - \( J = \frac{E}{Q_{\text{total}}} = \frac{16500}{3975} \approx 4.15 \, \text{J/cal} \).

Thus, the value of \( J \) is approximately **4.15 Joules/cal**, which corresponds to option **I**.
