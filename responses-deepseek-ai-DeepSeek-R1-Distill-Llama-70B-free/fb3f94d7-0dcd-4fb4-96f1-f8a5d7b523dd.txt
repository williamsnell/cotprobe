Okay, so I have this physics problem here about polarization using glass plates. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but let me try to work through it.

The question says that ordinary light is incident on a pile of eight glass plates at the polarizing angle. Each plate has a refractive index, n, of 1.75. I need to find the percentage polarization of the transmitted light. The options are from A to J.

Wait, okay, I remember that when unpolarized light hits a polarizing medium like a glass plate at the polarizing angle (also known as Brewster's angle), part of the light gets polarized. But when multiple plates are used, each one further polarizes the light, right?

So, the idea is that each plate acts as a polarizer. The formula I think is something like the intensity after each plate depends on the polarization from the previous one. Oh wait, Malus' Law! But wait, I think it's a bit different for each polarizer. Oh right, when you have multiple polarizers, the total effect is cumulative, but each subsequent polarizer can't increase the polarization beyond 100%, so each plate contributes to increasing the polarization percentage.

Wait, no, maybe it's about the transmission through each plate. Since each plate reflects some light and transmits some, but since it's at the polarizing angle, the reflected light is completely polarized, but the transmitted light isn't. Or wait, no, when light hits at Brewster's angle, the reflected light is 100% polarized (perpendicular to the plane of incidence, I think), but the transmitted light is partially polarized?

Wait, I think I might be mixing things up. Let me clarify. At Brewster's angle, the reflected light is 100% polarized with the electric field perpendicular to the plane of incidence. The transmitted light, however, is still partially polarized. But wait, wait—when unpolarized light is incident at Brewster's angle, the reflected light is entirely s-polarized, and the transmitted light is a mixture of s and p, but with more p-polarized light. Or is it the other way around?

Hmm, perhaps I should think in terms of the transmitted light after each plate. Each plate would only allow a certain percentage of the light to pass through, and each subsequent plate would further polarize it.

Wait, another approach. I remember that the polarization after passing through N plates can be calculated using the formula: ( (n^2)/(n^2 + 1) )^N multiplied by 100% to get the percentage. Wait, does that sound right?

Wait, no, maybe it's (n^2)/(n^2 +1) for each plate. Because at Brewster's angle, the reflectance for the s-polarized light is zero, and the transmitted intensity for the p-polarized is maximum. Wait, wait, let me try to remember the formula for the transmitted intensity.

The transmitted light through a single plate at Brewster's angle: The fraction of the intensity that is polarized is given by (n^2)/(n^2 +1), but wait, no. Wait, the polarization P is given by (I_p - I_s)/(I_p + I_s), but when you have a pile of plates, each one acts as a polarizer, and the overall effect is the product of each individual polarization.

Wait, perhaps each plate contributes a factor to the polarization. So each plate increases the polarization by a certain factor. So for each plate, the transmitted light's polarization is multiplied by (n^2)/(n^2 +1), or maybe (n^2 -1)/(n^2 +1)? Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, let me try to think step by step. The initial light is unpolarized, so it's 50% s and 50% p. When it hits the first plate at Brewster's angle, the transmitted light has more p-polarized component. The fraction of p-polarized light after the first plate would be (something).

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should look for the formula for the polarization after multiple plates.

Oh wait, I think the polarization after each plate is given by (n^2)/(n^2 +1) for each additional plate. So with N plates, the polarization is (n²/(n² + 1))^N multiplied by 100%.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because if n is large, each plate would contribute a higher polarization. But for n=1.75, n² is 3.0625, so (3.0625)/(3.0625 +1 ) = 3.0625/4.0625 ≈ 0.7535, so about 75% per plate? But that doesn't make sense because each plate can't contribute 75% polarization if the initial is 0% (unpolarized).

Wait, maybe the correct approach is to model each plate as a partial polarizer. The first plate polarizes the light to a certain degree, then each subsequent plate further increases the polarization.

Another approach: The polarization P after N plates is given by P = 1 - (1/(n² +1))^{N}.

Wait, I'm not so sure. Alternatively, the transmitted light after each plate is partially polarized. The formula for the degree of polarization after each plate in a pile is (n² -1)/(n² +1).

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Let me try to find the correct formula.

Wait, I remember that for each plate, the transmitted light's polarization increases. The formula for the polarization after N plates is (n² -1)/(n² +1) raised to the power N. Wait, but that can't be right because (n² -1)/(n² +1) for n=1.75 would be (3.0625 -1)/(3.0625 +1) = 2.0625/4.0625 ≈ 0.5078, so about 50.78% per plate. That would mean each plate contributes about 50% polarization. But that doesn't make sense because the first plate should give higher polarization.

Wait, alternatively, perhaps the polarization after each plate is given by (n²)/(n² +1), so each plate multiplies the polarization by that factor.

Wait, let me think again. When you have a pile of plates, each at Brewster's angle, the transmitted light becomes more polarized. The formula for the degree of polarization after N plates is (n² -1)^2N/(n² +1)^{2N}.

Wait, that's something I remember. Because each plate contributes a factor of (n² -1)/(n² +1) for both the front and back surfaces, so squared for each plate. Then for N plates, it's [(n² -1)/(n² +1)]^{2N}.

Wait, that sounds familiar. Let me check. Each plate has two surfaces, so the transmitted light goes through two refractions. So for each plate, the polarization factor is squared.

So for each plate, the factor is [(n² -1)/(n² +1)]².

Wait, no, wait. For a single surface, the reflection coefficient for p-polarized light is zero at Brewster's angle, so no reflection for p. The reflection for s-polarized is ( (n -1)/(n +1) )². Wait, but we're considering transmission, not reflection.

Wait, perhaps the transmitted light through each plate has the s and p components multiplied by certain factors. So for each plate, the s-component is multiplied by (2n)/(n +1)², and the p-component is multiplied by (2)/(n +1)². Wait, I'm not sure.

Alternatively, for a single plate, when light is incident at Brewster's angle, the transmitted light has s and p components. The p-component is transmitted without any loss (since reflection is zero), while the s-component is transmitted with some loss. The intensity of the transmitted s-polarized light is (2n)/(n +1)^2 times the incident intensity, and the p-polarized light is (2)/(n +1)^2 times the incident?

Wait, maybe that's not right. Let me think about the Fresnel equations. At Brewster's angle, the reflection coefficient for p-polarized light is zero. So all the p-polarized light is transmitted. For s-polarized light, the reflection coefficient is (n -1)/(n +1), but wait, no, the reflection coefficient for s is ( (n * sin(theta) ) - cos(theta) ) / ( ... ), but at Brewster's angle, theta_B = arctan(n), so sin(theta_B) = n / sqrt(1 +n²), cos(theta_B) = 1/sqrt(1 +n²). So the reflection coefficient for s is ( (n^2 -1) )/( (n^2 +1) ), or maybe ( (n^2 -1) )/( (sqrt(n^2 +1) + n)^2 )? Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this.

Wait, maybe I should just look up the standard formula for percentage polarization after N plates. Oh wait, but I can't do that right now. Hmm.

Wait, I think the correct approach is that each plate contributes a factor of (n²)/(n² +1) to the polarization. So for each plate, the polarization is multiplied by this factor.

Wait, no, that doesn't seem right. Let's think about it. The first plate takes unpolarized light and polarizes it. The degree of polarization after the first plate is (n² -1)/(n² +1). Then each subsequent plate increases the polarization.

Alternatively, the formula might be (n^2 -1)/(n^2 +1) raised to the number of plates.

Wait, for n=1.75, n^2 = 3.0625. So (3.0625-1)/(3.0625+1) = 2.0625/4.0625 ≈ 0.5078, so about 50.78% polarization per plate. But that doesn't make sense because with 8 plates, 0.5078^8 would be a very small number.

Wait, that can't be right. Maybe the formula is different. Another approach: The polarization after each plate is given by (1 - (1/(n^2 +1))^{number of plates}). Wait, no, that doesn't sound familiar either.

Wait, I think the correct formula is that each plate increases the polarization by a factor of (n²)/(n² +1). So the percentage polarization after N plates is (n²/(n² +1))^N multiplied by 100%.

But wait, n=1.75, n²=3.0625. So 3.0625/(3.0625 +1 )= 3.0625/4.0625 ≈ 0.7535. So 0.7535^8? Let's compute that.

0.7535^2 ≈ 0.568. ^4 would be ≈ 0.568^2 ≈ 0.323. ^8 would be ≈ 0.104. So 10.4% polarization. But that can't be right because the options are way higher. So that approach must be incorrect.

Hmm. Alternatively, perhaps each plate contributes a factor of (n² -1)/(n² +1), but that's about 0.5078 per plate. So (0.5078)^8 is about 0.5078^2=0.258, ^4=0.0667, ^8=0.00444, which is 0.444%, which is way too low. So that can't be right either.

Wait, perhaps the problem is about the transmitted light through multiple plates, each at Brewster's angle. And each plate only allows p-polarized light to pass through, but with some attenuation.

Wait, maybe I should model the intensity after each plate. Let's say the initial intensity is I_0, with equal parts s and p (so I_s = I_p = I_0/2).

After passing through the first plate at Brewster's angle, the reflected light is 100% s-polarized, but we're considering the transmitted light. So for the transmitted light, the s-component is transmitted with some factor, and the p-component is transmitted without loss.

Wait, no, at Brewster's angle, the reflection is zero for p-polarized light, so all p-polarized light is transmitted. But the s-polarized light does get reflected and transmitted. Wait, wait, no, for the transmitted light, the s-polarized component is transmitted but with some transmission coefficient.

Wait, no, the reflection at Brewster's angle is zero for p-polarized, so all p-polarized light is transmitted. For s-polarized light, the reflection is non-zero, so the transmitted s-polarized light is I_s * T, where T is the transmission coefficient.

But what is the transmission coefficient for s-polarized light at Brewster's angle? Hmm. The transmission coefficient for s-polarized light is given by T_s = (2 n)/( (n + 1)^2 ). For p-polarized, T_p = 1, since reflection is zero.

So initial I_s = I_0/2, I_p = I_0/2.

After first plate: I_s1 = (I0/2) * T_s, I_p1 = (I0/2) * T_p = I0/2.

So the total transmitted intensity is I_s1 + I_p1 = (I0/2)(T_s + 1).

The degree of polarization is (I_p - I_s)/(I_p + I_s). So after first plate, it's (I_p1 - I_s1)/(I_p1 + I_s1) = [ (I0/2) - (I0/2 T_s) ] / [ (I0/2)(1 + T_s) ) ].

Simplifying, numerator: (I0/2)(1 - T_s), denominator: (I0/2)(1 + T_s).

So polarization P = (1 - T_s)/(1 + T_s).

But T_s for s at Brewster's angle is (2n)/(n+1)^2.

Wait, let me plug that in.

T_s = 2n/(n+1)^2.

So 1 - T_s = 1 - 2n/(n+1)^2 = [ (n+1)^2 - 2n ] / (n+1)^2 ) = (n² + 2n +1 - 2n ) / (n+1)^2 ) = (n² +1)/(n+1)^2.

Similarly, 1 + T_s = 1 + 2n/(n+1)^2 = [ (n+1)^2 + 2n ] / (n+1)^2 ) = (n² + 2n +1 + 2n ) / (n+1)^2 ) = (n² +4n +1)/(n+1)^2?

Wait, wait, let me compute that again.

Wait, 1 = (n+1)^2 / (n+1)^2.

So 1 + T_s = [ (n+1)^2 + 2n ] / (n+1)^2.

(n+1)^2 is n² + 2n +1. Adding 2n gives n² +4n +1. So numerator is n² +4n +1.

Wait, but that doesn't factor nicely. Hmm.

So P after first plate is [ (n² +1) / (n+1)^2 ) ] / [ (n² +4n +1) / (n+1)^2 ) ] = (n² +1)/(n² +4n +1).

But wait, let me compute this for n=1.75.

n=1.75, n²=3.0625.

n² +1 = 4.0625.

n² +4n +1 = 3.0625 + 7 +1 = 11.0625.

So P = 4.0625 / 11.0625 ≈ 0.367, so about 36.7%.

Wait, that's after the first plate. So each subsequent plate would do the same thing, but now the light is partially polarized.

Hmm, but this seems complicated because each plate after the first would have different transmission coefficients based on the current polarization state.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a simpler formula for multiple plates. I think the formula for the polarization after N plates is (n² -1)/(n² +1) raised to the power N. But wait, let's compute that.

n=1.75, n²=3.0625.

(n² -1)=2.0625.

(n² +1)=4.0625.

So (2.0625/4.0625) = approx 0.5078.

Raised to the 8th power: 0.5078^8.

Let me compute that.

0.5078^2 ≈ 0.258.

^4: 0.258^2 ≈ 0.0666.

^8: 0.0666^2 ≈ 0.00443, so 0.443%.

But that's way lower than any of the options. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe the polarization after N plates is 1 - (1/(n² +1))^(N/2).

Wait, that's just a guess. Let me try N=8.

So 1/(n² +1) = 1/4.0625 ≈ 0.2462.

0.2462^(4) would be 0.2462^2=0.0605, squared again is ~0.00366. So 1 - 0.00366 ≈ 0.9963, or 99.63%, which is not an option either.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think again.

When you pass through a stack of N plates, each at Brewster's angle, the transmitted light's polarization increases. The formula for the degree of polarization P is given by:

P = 1 - (1/(n² +1))^{N}.

Wait, let's try N=8.

1/(n² +1) = 1/4.0625 ≈ 0.24615.

0.24615^8 ≈ ?

Compute 0.246^2=0.060516.

0.0605^2= ~0.00366.

0.00366^2= ~0.0000134.

So 1 - 0.0000134 ≈ 0.9999866, which is 99.99866%. But the options don't include 100% except J is 95%, which is lower. So that can't be right.

Wait, perhaps the formula is P =
