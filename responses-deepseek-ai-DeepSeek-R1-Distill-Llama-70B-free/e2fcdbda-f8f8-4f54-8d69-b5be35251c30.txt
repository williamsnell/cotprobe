Question:

In order to calculate the cationic and anionic mobilities of the potassium (K^+) and chloride ions (Cl^-) in a .05 normal solution at 25°C, the moving boundary technique was used to first determine t_+, the cationic transport number.

Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. Hmm, it's about calculating cationic and anionic mobilities using the moving boundary technique. I remember that the moving boundary method is used to determine the transport numbers of ions in an electrolyte solution.

So the question gives me a solution of 0.05 normal (which I think means 0.05 M for each ion because KCl dissociates into K+ and Cl-). The cell has a cross-sectional area of 1 cm². A current of 0.007 A was applied for 1 hour, and the boundary moved 2.56 cm. The molar conductivity (λ) is given as 136.0 cm² mol⁻¹ Ω⁻¹.

I need to find the mobilities μ+ and μ- for K+ and Cl- respectively.

Wait, I remember that the transport number t+ is the fraction of the current carried by the cations. So t+ = (μ+)/(μ+ + μ-). Because the total conductivity is the sum of the individual ion conductivities.

But how do I calculate t+ first? Oh right, using the moving boundary method. The formula for the transport number is t+ = (Ccat * v * A * t)/(I * M), where Ccat is the concentration of the cation, v is the velocity, A is the area, t is time, I is current, and M is molarity? Or wait, maybe the formula is t+ = (distance moved * cross-sectional area * concentration)/(current * time). 

Wait, another approach: The transport number can be calculated using t+ = (u+)/(u+ + u-), but I think in the moving boundary method, the distance the boundary moves is related to the velocity of the ions, which depends on their mobility.

Oh yeah, the velocity v of the ion is given by v = (μ * E), where E is the electric field. The electric field E can be calculated as E = V/L, but wait, I'm not sure about the exact steps here.

Alternatively, I think the formula for the transport number t+ is given by the equation:

t+ = (distance moved × cross-sectional area × concentration) / (current × time)

Wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Let me think again. The cationic transport number t+ is the ratio of the cation mobility to the total mobility (μ+ + μ-). So t+ = μ+/(μ+ + μ-).

Another thought: the equivalent conductivity Λ is given by the sum of the individual ion conductivities. So Λ = λ+ + λ- = (μ+ + μ-) * z, where z is the charge (but for 1:1 electrolyte, z=1, so Λ = μ+ + μ-.

Wait, molar conductivity λ is given as 136 cm² mol⁻¹ Ω⁻¹. Since it's a 1:1 electrolyte, λ = λ+ + λ- = μ+ + μ- because λ = μ*z, and z is 1 here.

So, total molar conductivity λ = μ+ + μ- = 136 cm² mol⁻¹ Ω⁻¹.

But I need to find each μ. For that, I need t+, because μ+ = t+ * λ.

So the plan is:

1. Calculate t+ using the moving boundary data.
2. Then μ+ = t+ * λ.
3. Then μ- = λ - μ+.

So step 1: finding t+.

The formula for t+ using moving boundary is:

t+ = (C * v * A * t) / (I * t)

Wait, no, I think the formula is t+ = (C * d * A) / (I * t), where d is the distance the boundary moved.

Hmm, wait, I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me look up the formula. Oh wait, in an exam setting I can't, but I'll have to think. So in the moving boundary method, the distance moved by the boundary is related to the velocity of the ions. The velocity is μ * E. The electric field E can be found from E = I/(A * κ), where κ is the conductivity? Or maybe E = V/L, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the formula for the transport number is t+ = (u+)/(u+ + u-) = (v+ * C+) / (v+ * C+ + v- * C- ), but in a solution where the concentration of cations and anions are equal (like KCl), C+ = C- = 0.05 N. So t+ simplifies to (v+) / (v+ + v- ), and since v = μ * E, and E is same for both, t+ = μ+ / (μ+ + μ-).

So to find t+, I need the ratio of the mobilities. But how?

Wait, another approach. The distance moved by the boundary, d, is equal to the velocity of the cation times time. Because the boundary moves at the velocity of the slower ion (but I'm not sure about that). Alternatively, for a 1:1 electrolyte, the boundary moves at the velocity of the cation, which is μ+ * E.

So d = v+ * t. So v+ = d / t.

But E is the electric field. E can be found from Ohm's law: V = I * R. Also, conductivity κ = 1 / R. Wait, but R is the resistance, which is related to the cell's dimensions.

Wait, the solution's conductivity κ is given by the molar conductivity multiplied by the concentration. Because κ = Λ * c, where c is in mol/m³. Wait, but the given λ is molar conductivity at a certain concentration, but here we have 0.05 N solution.

Wait, let's compute the conductivity κ. Since λ is 136 cm² mol⁻¹ Ω⁻¹, and the concentration c is 0.05 mol/dm³ (because 0.05 N for 1:1 electrolyte is same as 0.05 M), so κ = λ * c = 136 cm² mol⁻¹ Ω⁻¹ * 0.05 mol/dm³. But units need to be consistent.

Wait, 1 S (Siemens) is equivalent to 1 Ω⁻¹. So cm² mol⁻¹ Ω⁻¹ is same as cm² mol⁻¹ S.

So κ = 136 cm² mol⁻¹ S⁻¹ * 0.05 mol/dm³. But 1 dm³ is 1000 cm³, so 1 mol/dm³ = 1000 mol/cm³. So 0.05 mol/dm³ = 0.05 * 1000 mol/cm³ = 50 mol/cm³.

Wait, but 136 cm² mol⁻¹ S⁻¹ * 0.05 mol/dm³ → because 0.05 mol/dm³ = 0.00005 mol/cm³ (since 1 dm³ = 1e3 cm³), so 0.05 / 1e3 = 0.00005 mol/cm³.

So κ = 136 * 0.00005 = 0.0068 S/cm.

Wait, but that seems low. Let me recalculate:

Wait 0.05 N is 0.05 equivalents per liter. For KCl, which is 1:1, that's 0.05 M. So concentration c = 0.05 mol/L = 0.05 mmol/cm³ (since 1 L = 1000 cm³, so 0.05 mol/L = 0.00005 mol/cm³, which is 0.05 mmol/cm³).

Wait, let me get the units straight. Molar conductivity λ is in cm² mol⁻¹ S⁻¹.

Conductivity κ is (unit: S/cm) = λ (cm² mol⁻¹ S⁻¹) * c (mol/cm³) → because (cm²/(mol·S)) * (mol/cm³) ) = S/cm.

So c is 0.05 mol/dm³ → which is 0.05 / 0.001 = 50 mol/m³, but wait, no—1 dm³ is 1 liter, so 0.05 mol/dm³ is 0.05 M, which is 0.05 mol/L. To convert to mol/cm³, divide by 1000 (since 1 L = 1000 cm³):

c = 0.05 mol/L = 0.05 / 1000 mol/cm³ = 0.00005 mol/cm³.

So κ = λ * c = 136 (cm²/(mol·S)) * 0.00005 (mol/cm³) ) → let's compute:

136 * 0.00005 = 0.0068 S/cm.

So κ = 0.0068 S/cm.

Now, the cell's cross-sectional area is 1 cm², and the length between electrodes is L. Wait, but we don't know L. Hmm.

Alternatively, the electric field E is calculated as E = I / (κ * A), where I is current, A is area, and κ is conductivity.

Wait, because E = (V) / L, and V = I * R, and R = 1/(κ * A/L) ) → so V = I * (1/(κ * A/L)) ) → V = I * L/(κ A). So E = V/L = I/(κ A).

Yes, that makes sense. So E = I/(κ A).

Given I=0.007 A, κ=0.0068 S/cm, A=1 cm².

So E = 0.007 / (0.0068 * 1) → 0.007 / 0.0068 ≈ 1.02941 V/cm.

Wait, but 0.007 / 0.0068 is approximately 1.029, yes.

Now, the velocity of the cation v+ is μ+ * E. Because v = μ * E.

The distance d moved by the boundary is v+ * t.

t is 1 hour = 3600 seconds.

So d = μ+ * E * t.

Solving for μ+:

μ+ = d / (E * t).

But wait, d is given as 2.56 cm.

So plug in the numbers:

μ+ = (2.56 cm) / (1.02941 V/cm * 3600 s).

Wait, let's compute that.

First, calculate the denominator: 1.02941 V/cm * 3600 s = 1.02941 * 3600 ≈ 3705.3 V·s/cm.

So μ+ = 2.56 / 3705.3 ≈ 0.000691 m²/(V·s). Because 1 cm = 0.01 m, so 2.56 cm = 0.0256 m, but wait no—wait, the units:

Wait, d is in cm, E is in V/cm, t in seconds.

So units of μ+ would be cm/( (V/cm) * s ) ) → cm²/(V s).

But since 1 m²/(V s) = 1e4 cm²/(V s), because 1 m² = (100 cm)^2 = 1e4 cm².

Wait, let's correct the calculation.

Wait, let's compute E in V/m.

Because 1 V/cm = 100 V/m.

So E = 1.02941 V/cm → 102.941 V/m.

Now, d = 2.56 cm = 0.0256 m.

t = 3600 s.

So μ+ = d / (E * t) → 0.0256 m / (102.941 V/m * 3600 s)

Compute denominator: 102.941 * 3600 ≈ 370,  let's see: 100*3600=360,000. 2.941*3600≈10,586. So total approx 370,586 V·s/m.

Wait, but 102.941 *3600 = ?

Compute 100 * 3600 = 360,000.

2.941 * 3600 = let's compute:

2 * 3600 =7200.

0.941 * 3600 = approx 3387.6.

Total 7200 + 3387.6= 10587.6.

So total E*t = 360,000 + 10,587.6 = 370,587.6 ≈ 3.705876e5 V·s/m.

So μ+ = 0.0256 / 3.705876e5 → let's compute.

0.0256 / 370,587.6 → approximately 6.91e-8 m²/(V s).

Because 0.0256 / 370588 ≈ 6.91e-8.

So μ+ ≈ 6.91e-8 m²/(V s).

Now, since the total molar conductivity is λ = μ+ + μ- = 136 cm² mol⁻¹ S⁻¹.

Wait, but wait, λ has units of cm² mol⁻¹ S⁻¹, and μ has units of m²/(V s). But since S is equivalent to (A/V), so μ's unit m²/(V s) is the same as m²/(A s·V/A )? Hmm, maybe I'm getting stuck on unit conversion here.

Wait, perhaps I should convert λ from cm²/(mol·S) to m²/(mol·S) to match μ's units.

Wait, 1 cm² = 1e-4 m². So 136 cm²/(mol·S) = 136e-4 m²/(mol·S) = 0.0136 m²/(mol·S).

But S is Siemens, which is A/V. So λ in m²/(mol·A/V) → m²·V/(mol·A). Hmm, not sure if that's helpful.

Wait, remember that μ (mobility) has units of m²/(V·s). So the sum μ+ + μ- = λ, but I need to make sure the units match.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Because I thought λ = μ+ + μ-, but λ is in cm² mol⁻¹ S⁻¹. Wait, no, λ is molar conductivity, which is given as the conductivity per mole. So for 1:1 electrolyte, λ = λ+ + λ- = (μ+ + μ-) * z, where z is the charge. Since z=1, λ = μ+ + μ-.

But wait, the units:

λ is in S·cm²·mol⁻¹.

Wait, no, the unit of molar conductivity is S·m²·mol⁻¹, but in this problem, it's given as 136.0 cm² mol⁻¹ Ω⁻¹. Oh wait, same as S·cm²/mol.

So let's convert λ from cm²/(mol·Ω) to m²/(mol·Ω), since 1 cm² = 1e-4 m².

So λ = 136 cm²/(mol·Ω) = 136e-4 m²/(mol·Ω) = 0.0136 m²/(mol·Ω).

But wait, since 1 S = 1 Ω⁻¹, so 1 Ω = 1 S⁻¹. So 1 m²/(mol·Ω) is same as m²·S/(mol).

So, λ = 0.0136 m²·S/(mol).

But the mobility μ is in m²/(V·s). And since S = A/V, so 1 S = 1 A/V. So m²/(V·s) is same as m²·S/(A·s).

Wait, perhaps it's better to find the relation between μ and λ.

I think the correct relation is λ = μ * z * F, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, since μ is mobility, which is (m²/s)/(V/m), so m²/(V·s).

Wait, let me think about the relation between molar conductivity and mobility.

The molar conductivity is the conductivity per mole, so for each ion, λ = (z * F * μ) / (1000), where F is Faraday's constant (96485 C/mol), but I'm probably mixing things up.

Wait, the equivalent conductivity Λ is given by Λ = F * (μ+ + μ- ), but I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, the molar conductivity λ is equal to the sum of the individual ion conductivities. So λ = λ+ + λ-.

Each ion's conductivity is given by λ+ = μ+ * z+ * F, but wait, z is the charge, F is Faraday's constant. But for KCl, z+ and z- are both 1.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let's think again.

The molar conductivity λ is given as 136 cm² mol⁻¹ Ω⁻¹.

We have to have λ = μ+ + μ-.

Wait, but μ is in m²/(V·s), and λ is in cm²/(mol·Ω). So we need to convert λ into the same units as μ.

Wait, 1 cm² = 1e-4 m². 1 Ω is 1 V/A. So:

λ in m²/(mol·V·A) → Wait, no, let's redo the units.

Alternatively, perhaps I should convert the molar conductivity into S·m²/(mol), since λ is given in cm²/(mol·Ω) → which is same as S·cm²/(mol) → since 1 S = 1 Ω⁻¹.

So 136 cm²/(mol·Ω) = 136 S·cm²/mol = 136 * (1e-4 m²) * S / mol → 0.0136 S·m²/mol.

But S is A/V, so 0.0136 A·m²/(V·mol).

Now, the mobility μ is in m²/(V·s). So how does λ relate to μ?

Wait, perhaps the molar conductivity is the sum of the products of each ion's mobility, charge, and Faraday's constant, divided by 1000 (for conversion).

Wait, I think the correct formula is λ = (μ+ * z+ * F) + (μ- * z- * F) ) / 1000.

Because for each ion, the conductivity is μ * z * c, where c is concentration. But in molar conductivity, c is 1 mol/m³, so the molar conductivity would be μ * z * F / 1000, since F is 96485 C/mol, and the units would need to be adjusted.

Wait, perhaps I should look for the relation between
