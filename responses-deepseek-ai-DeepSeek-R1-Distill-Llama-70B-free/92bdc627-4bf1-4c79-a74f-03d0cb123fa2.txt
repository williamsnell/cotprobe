Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about candies and their traditional flavors. The question is asking which candy is traditionally fruit-flavored. The options are from A to J, each being a different candy. Hmm, I need to figure this out step by step.

Let me start by recalling what each of these candies typically tastes like. I'm not super familiar with all of them, but I can think through each one.

Option A: Kit Kat. I know Kit Kat is a chocolate bar with a crispy wafer inside. The main flavor is chocolate, so probably not fruit-flavored.

Option B: M&M's. These are chocolate candies with a colorful candy coating. The standard flavors are chocolate, peanut, maybe almond, but I don't think they're fruit-flavored traditionally. They have other varieties now, like tropical, but that's not the traditional.

Option C: Almond Joy. I remember this one has coconut and an almond, covered in chocolate. So the main flavors are coconut and maybe almond, not fruit like orange or cherry.

Option D: Junior Mints. These are small rectangular mints, right? They have a peppermint flavor, so that's not fruit.

Option E: Skittles. Oh, Skittles! They're those chewy candies with different fruit flavors. I think they come in orange, grape, lemon, lime, etc. So this seems like a strong candidate for the answer.

Option F: Milky Way. This is a chocolate bar with nougat and caramel. The flavor is more on the sweet and chocolatey side, not fruit.

Option G: Snickers. Another chocolate bar, this one with peanuts, caramel, and nougat. Definitely not fruit-flavored.

Option H: Butterfinger. This is a candy bar with a crispy, peanut butter-flavored center covered in chocolate. Not fruit.

Option I: Hershey's Chocolate Bar. That's just plain milk chocolate, no fruit involved.

Option J: Reese's Pieces. These are peanut butter candies, like small rounds with peanut butter centers. Not fruit-flavored.

So, putting it all together, the only candy in the list that's traditionally fruit-flavored is Skittles, which is option E. All the others are either chocolate-based, nut-flavored, or minty. So I should choose E as the correct answer.
