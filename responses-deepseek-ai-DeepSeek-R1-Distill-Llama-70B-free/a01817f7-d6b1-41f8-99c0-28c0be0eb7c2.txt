Alright, so I've got this problem here where I need to find the inverse Laplace transform of a function F(s). The function is given as F(s) = (3s + 1) / [(s - 1)(s² + 1)]. Hmm, okay, I remember that the inverse Laplace transform can be found by breaking down the function into partial fractions and then matching each term to known Laplace transforms.

First, I think I should decompose F(s) into simpler fractions. The denominator factors are (s - 1) and (s² + 1), so I can write it as:

F(s) = A / (s - 1) + (Bs + C) / (s² + 1)

Where A, B, and C are constants I need to find. To find these constants, I'll multiply both sides by the denominator (s - 1)(s² + 1) to get rid of the fractions:

3s + 1 = A(s² + 1) + (Bs + C)(s - 1)

Now I'll expand the right-hand side:

A(s² + 1) = A s² + A
(Bs + C)(s - 1) = B s² - B s + C s - C

Combine like terms:

(A + B) s² + (C - B) s + (A - C)

So now, the equation becomes:

3s + 1 = (A + B) s² + (C - B) s + (A - C)

Since this must hold for all s, the coefficients of corresponding powers of s must be equal on both sides. Let's set up equations by matching coefficients:

1. Coefficient of s²: A + B = 0
2. Coefficient of s: C - B = 3
3. Constant term: A - C = 1

Now I'll solve this system of equations.

From equation 1: A = -B

From equation 3: A - C = 1. Substitute A = -B into this:
-B - C = 1 → -(B + C) = 1 → B + C = -1

From equation 2: C - B = 3 → C = B + 3

Substitute C = B + 3 into B + C = -1:
B + (B + 3) = -1 → 2B + 3 = -1 → 2B = -4 → B = -2

Now, since A = -B → A = 2

And C = B + 3 → C = -2 + 3 = 1

So, the partial fractions are:

F(s) = 2 / (s - 1) + (-2s + 1) / (s² + 1)

Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let me double-check. The partial fraction decomposition was:

F(s) = A / (s - 1) + (Bs + C) / (s² + 1)

We found A = 2, B = -2, C = 1. So:

F(s) = 2 / (s - 1) + (-2s + 1) / (s² + 1)

But I think I can split the second term further:

(-2s + 1) / (s² + 1) = -2s / (s² + 1) + 1 / (s² + 1)

Now, I recall the standard Laplace transforms:

- L^{-1} {1 / (s - a)} = e^{at}
- L^{-1} {s / (s² + a²)} = cos(at)
- L^{-1} {a / (s² + a²)} = sin(at)

Applying this to each term:

- The first term: 2 / (s - 1) → 2 e^{t}
- The second term: -2s / (s² + 1) → -2 cos(t)
- The third term: 1 / (s² + 1) → sin(t)

So combining these:

f(t) = 2 e^{t} - 2 cos(t) + sin(t)

Wait, let me check the options. Looking at option G: 2e^t - 2 cos t + sin t. That matches what I got. So the answer should be G.

But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the partial fractions:

3s + 1 = A(s² + 1) + (Bs + C)(s - 1)

Expanding:

A s² + A + B s² - B s + C s - C

Combine like terms:

(A + B) s² + (C - B) s + (A - C)

Set equal to 3s + 1:

A + B = 0 → A = -B

C - B = 3

A - C = 1

Solving as before: A=2, B=-2, C=1

So F(s) = 2/(s-1) + (-2s +1)/(s²+1)

Breaking down (-2s +1)/(s²+1) gives -2s/(s²+1) + 1/(s²+1)

Inverse transforms: 2e^t - 2cos(t) + sin(t)

Yes, that seems correct. So the correct option is G.

To determine the inverse Laplace transform of \( F(s) = \frac{3s + 1}{(s - 1)(s^2 + 1)} \), we first decompose \( F(s) \) into partial fractions:

\[
F(s) = \frac{A}{s - 1} + \frac{Bs + C}{s^2 + 1}
\]

Multiplying through by the denominator \((s - 1)(s^2 + 1)\), we get:

\[
3s + 1 = A(s^2 + 1) + (Bs + C)(s - 1)
\]

Expanding and combining like terms:

\[
3s + 1 = (A + B)s^2 + (C - B)s + (A - C)
\]

Matching coefficients of \( s^2 \), \( s \), and the constant term:

1. \( A + B = 0 \)
2. \( C - B = 3 \)
3. \( A - C = 1 \)

Solving this system:

- From \( A + B = 0 \), we get \( A = -B \).
- Substituting \( A = -B \) into \( A - C = 1 \), we get \( -B - C = 1 \), or \( B + C = -1 \).
- From \( C - B = 3 \), we get \( C = B + 3 \).
- Substituting \( C = B + 3 \) into \( B + C = -1 \), we get \( B + (B + 3) = -1 \), so \( 2B = -4 \), and \( B = -2 \).
- Using \( A = -B \), we find \( A = 2 \).
- Using \( C = B + 3 \), we find \( C = 1 \).

Thus, the partial fraction decomposition is:

\[
F(s) = \frac{2}{s - 1} + \frac{-2s + 1}{s^2 + 1}
\]

Breaking this into simpler terms:

\[
F(s) = \frac{2}{s - 1} - \frac{2s}{s^2 + 1} + \frac{1}{s^2 + 1}
\]

Now, taking the inverse Laplace transform term by term:

1. \( \mathcal{L}^{-1} \left\{ \frac{2}{s - 1} \right\} = 2e^t \)
2. \( \mathcal{L}^{-1} \left\{ -\frac{2s}{s^2 + 1} \right\} = -2\cos(t) \)
3. \( \mathcal{L}^{-1} \left\{ \frac{1}{s^2 + 1} \right\} = \sin(t) \)

Combining these results:

\[
f(t) = 2e^t - 2\cos(t) + \sin(t)
\]

Comparing this with the given options, the correct answer is:

**G: \( 2e^t - 2\cos t + \sin t \)**
