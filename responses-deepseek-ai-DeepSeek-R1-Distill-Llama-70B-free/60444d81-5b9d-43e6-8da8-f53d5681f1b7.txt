Okay, so I have this physics problem here about radio astronomy and rotational constants. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

Alright, the question says that there are these interstellar clouds emitting photons observed with a certain frequency. The transition is from j=1 to j=0, and I need to find the rotational constant B. The given frequency is 1.158 × 10^11 Hz.

Wait, I remember that in rotational spectroscopy, the energy levels are quantized. The energy for a rotational state j is given by E_j = B * j * (j + 1), where B is the rotational constant. Oh right, and when a transition happens from a higher energy state to a lower one, a photon is emitted with a frequency corresponding to the energy difference.

So the transition is from j=1 to j=0. I think the energy difference ΔE would be E_1 - E_0. Let's compute that. E_1 is B * 1 * (1 + 1) = 2B. E_0 is B * 0 * (0 + 1) = 0. So the difference is 2B - 0 = 2B.

The photon's energy is related to its frequency by Planck's equation, E_photon = h * ν. But wait, the energy difference is also equal to h times the frequency of the emitted photon. So ΔE = h * ν.

Substituting in, 2B = h * ν. But wait, I'm a bit confused here. No, wait, the frequency of the photon should match the energy difference divided by h. So ν = ΔE / h. Oh wait, but I think in some cases, especially rotational transitions, the selection rule is Δj = ±1, so for j=1 to j=0, that's allowed.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit mixed up. Let me think again. The energy levels are E_j = B j (j+1). The transition is j=1 → j=0. So the emitted photon's frequency ν is given by (E_1 - E_0)/h. So that's (2B - 0)/h = 2B/h. So ν = 2B/h.

Wait, but wait another thing. I'm trying to remember the exact formula. Another approach: the rotational constant B is related to the moment of inertia. The energy levels are E_j = (ħ² / (2I)) j(j+1), where I is the moment of inertia. And the rotational constant B is defined as ħ²/(2I), so E_j = B j(j+1). That part I got right.

So the transition from j=1 to j=0 emits a photon with energy E_photon = E_1 - E_0 = 2B. So E_photon = 2B.

But E_photon is also hν. So 2B = h ν. Therefore, B = (h ν) / 2.

Wait, but wait, let me make sure. Because sometimes I've seen the formula written as the frequency being 2B. Let me check. Oh wait, another formula: the transition frequency is (E_upper - E_lower)/h. E_upper is j=1, E_lower is j=0. So E_upper - E_lower = 2B. So ν = (2B)/h.

So solving for B: B = (ν h) / 2.

Hold on, but what's the value of h? Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 × 10^-34 J·s.

But wait, the given ν is 1.158 × 10^11 Hz. So plugging in the numbers:

B = (1.158e11 Hz * 6.626e-34 J·s) / 2.

Wait, but wait. Let me compute that. Let me calculate this step by step.

First, multiply ν and h: 1.158e11 * 6.626e-34.

1.158e11 is 1.158 × 1e11, 6.626e-34 is 6.626 × 1e-34.

Multiplying 1.158 and 6.626 gives approximately 7.676 (since 1.158 *6 is 6.948, 1.158 *0.626≈0.725, total around 7.673).

Then, the exponents: 1e11 * 1e-34 = 1e-23.

So 7.673e-23 J·s·Hz? Wait, Hz is 1/s, so J·s * 1/s would be J.

Wait, no, let me think again. ν is in Hz, which is 1/s. h is J·s. So hν would be (J·s)(1/s) )= J. So E_photon is hν, which is in Joules.

But wait, I'm trying to find B in terms of frequency units. But B is in energy terms, but sometimes it's expressed in cm^-1 or Hz.

Wait, perhaps I confused the units. Alternatively, maybe there's a more straightforward approach using the relationship between rotational constant and the emitted frequency.

Wait another angle: the rotational constant B can also be expressed in terms of frequency as B = (h / (8π² c)) * something. Hmm, maybe that's complicating things.

Wait, perhaps I should use wavenumbers. The rotational constant B is often expressed in cm^-1. The relation between energy and wavenumbers is E = h c σ, where σ is the wavenumber (cm^-1). So E_j = B j(j+1) = h c σ_j.

But in this problem, we're given the frequency ν, which relates to the energy via E = h ν. So E = h ν = h c σ → σ = ν / c.

So combining these, E_j = h c σ = h c (ν / c) ) = h ν. Wait, that's redundant.

Wait, maybe it's better to just stick to the initial approach.

So going back, from the transition j=1 to j=0, the emitted photon has frequency ν. So the energy difference is E = 2B (since E_1=2B, E_0=0). So 2B = h ν → B = (h ν) / 2.

But wait, plugging in the numbers:

h = 6.626e-34 J·s
ν = 1.158e11 Hz.

So B = (6.626e-34 * 1.158e11) / 2.

Calculate 6.626e-34 * 1.158e11 first.

6.626 * 1.158 is approximately:

6 * 1.158 = 6.948, 0.626 *1.158 ≈ 0.725. Total ≈7.673.

So 7.673e-34+11 = 7.673e-23. Then divide by 2: 7.673e-23 / 2 = 3.8365e-23 J.

But wait, the rotational constant B is usually expressed in terms of frequency units. Because 1 Hz is 1/s, but B is often in cm^-1 or sometimes in MHz or GHz.

Wait, perhaps I should express B in terms of frequency, since the options are all in Hz. So perhaps I need to find B in Hz.

Wait, another approach: The rotational constant B is defined such that E_j = h B j(j+1). So E_j = h B j(j+1).

So when j=1, E_1 = h B (1)(2) = 2 h B.

The energy difference between j=1 and j=0 is E_1 - E_0 = 2 h B - 0 = 2 h B.

But this energy difference is also equal to h ν, since the photon's energy is h ν.

So 2 h B = h ν → 2 B = ν → B = ν / 2.

Wait wait, that's a much simpler approach. Oh! Because if E_j = h B j(j+1), then E_1 = 2 h B.

The transition from j=1 to j=0 emits a photon of energy E_photon = E_1 - E_0 = 2 h B.

And E_photon = h ν. So 2 h B = h ν → 2 B = ν → B = ν / 2.

So that's much simpler. So B is just half the observed frequency.

Given ν is 1.158 × 10^11 Hz.

So B = 1.158e11 / 2 = 5.79e10 Hz.

Wait, but let me compute that accurately.

1.158e11 / 2 = (1.158 / 2) × 1e11.

1.158 / 2 = 0.579.

So 0.579e11 Hz = 5.79e10 Hz.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see which one matches this.

Options:

A: 2.636 × 1e11

B:4.636e11

C:1.636e11

D:7.636e11

E:2.079e11

F:3.158e11

G:6.636e11

H:1.158e10

I:5.636e10

J:3.636e11

Wait, our result is 5.79e10 Hz. Looking at the options, option I is 5.636e10. That's close but not exact. Hmm. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Wait, let me double-check the calculation.

We have B = ν / 2 = (1.158e11 Hz) / 2 = 5.79e10 Hz.

Looking at the options, I find option I is 5.636e10. Hmm, that's 5.636, which is lower than 5.79. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe I messed up the energy levels. Let me think again.

Wait, the rotational energy levels are given by E_j = B j (j+1). So for j=1, E_1 = B * 1 * 2 = 2B.

But when the molecule drops from j=1 to j=0, it emits a photon with energy E = E_1 - E_0 = 2B.

But also, E = h ν. So 2B = h ν → B = h ν / 2.

Wait, but that's what I did earlier, which gives 5.79e10 Hz. But none of the options exactly match that. The closest is option I:5.636e10.

But wait, perhaps I should compute more accurately. Let's do the exact calculation.

Compute h * ν: 6.62607015e-34 J·s * 1.158e11 Hz.

But wait, since I'm looking for B in terms of frequency, perhaps I should use the relation B = ν / 2, but maybe I got the formula wrong.

Wait, maybe the formula is B = ν / (2). So 1.158e11 / 2 = 5.79e10 Hz. But is this correct?

Alternatively, perhaps the formula is ν = 2B → B = ν/2. So yes, same result.

But perhaps I should re-express B in terms of cm^-1. Because sometimes B is given in wavenumbers (cm^-1), and then converted to frequency.

Wait, maybe I missed a factor of c, the speed of light. Because energy can be in terms of wavenumbers (which involve 1/λ, and λ is related to c/ν).

Wait, let's think in terms of spectroscopy.

The energy levels are E_j = B j(j+1), where B is a constant with units of energy. But in spectroscopy, B is often expressed in cm^-1, which is 1/λ (wavenumber).

The relation between energy E and wavenumber σ is E = h c σ. So in terms of wavenumbers, E_j = h c σ_j = h c B' j (j+1), where B' is B in cm^-1. Hmm, this might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct formula linking the frequency ν to the rotational constant B is ν = (2 B)/h. Wait, earlier I had ν = 2B/h, but that's not correct because B is in energy units. So perhaps I messed up the units earlier.

Wait, let's clarify: the rotational constant B is defined such that E_j = B j(j+1). So E_j has units of energy (Joules). So when I write ν = (E_1 - E_0)/h → ν = (2B)/h.

So since E = h ν → 2B = h ν → ν = 2B / h.

So solving for B: B = (h ν) / 2.

But h is in J·s, ν in Hz (1/s), so B would have units of J.

But maybe the question expects B in terms of Hz. Because the options are all in Hz.

So let me compute B in Hz.

Wait, if I have B in Joules, I can convert it to frequency using E = h ν → ν = E / h.

Wait, perhaps not. Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to express B in terms of frequency directly.

Wait, perhaps I should think that the rotational constant B is defined in terms of the frequency of the transition. So for the j=1 → j=0 transition, the frequency is ν = 2B. So B = ν/2.

Which would make B = (1.158e11 Hz)/2 = 5.79e10 Hz.

But looking at the options, option I is 5.636e10 Hz. Hmm, which is 5.636 ×1e10 =5.636e10.

But my calculation gives 5.79e10, which is not exactly any of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait, another thought. In rotational spectroscopy, the selection rule is Δj=±1, and the transition frequency is given by ν = (2 j + 1) B, where j is the higher state.

Wait, that might be a different approach. Let me check.

Wait, if the transition is from j to j-1, then the frequency is ν = [E_j - E_{j-1}]/h.

E_j = B j(j+1)
E_{j-1} = B (j-1) j

So difference ΔE = B [j(j+1) - (j-1)j ] = B [j² +j - (j² -j) ] = B [2j].

So ΔE = 2j B.

Then ν = (2j B) / h.

Wait, but in this case, j is the initial state. If the transition is from j=1 to j=0, then j=1.

So ν = (2 *1 * B) / h → ν = (2B)/h.

So solving for B: B = (h ν) / 2.

Which brings me back to the earlier calculation.

So B = (6.626e-34 J·s * 1.158e11 Hz) / 2.

Calculating that:

6.626e-34 * 1.158e11 = let me compute 6.626 * 1.158 first.

6 * 1.158 = 6.948
0.626 *1.158 = let's compute 0.6 *1.158=0.6948, 0.026*1.158≈0.0301. So total ≈0.6948 +0.0301=0.7249.

So total 6.948 + 0.7249=7.6729.

So 7.6729e-34+11=7.6729e-23 J.

Divide by 2: 3.83645e-23 J.

But the options are all in Hz. So I think I made a mistake in the units. Because B is in Joules, but the options are in Hz.

Wait, I need to convert Joules to Hz. Because 1 Hz is 1/s, and E=h ν → ν = E/h.

So if I have B in Joules, to get it in Hz, I divide by h.

So B (in Hz) = (3.83645e-23 J ) / (6.626e-34 J·s) )

Wait, because h is 6.626e-34 J·s. So dividing J by J·s gives 1/s = Hz.

So 3.83645e-23 / 6.626e-34 = let's compute that.

3.83645e-23 /6.626e-34 = (3.83645 / 6.626 ) * 1e11.

3.83645 / 6.626 ≈ 0.579.

So 0.579e11 Hz = 5.79e10 Hz.

Again, same result. But looking at the options, the closest is option I:5.636e10 Hz.

Hmm, perhaps the given data uses a different value for Planck's constant? Let me think. Maybe the exact value isn't 6.626e-34 but an approximation like 6.63e-34.

Compute with h=6.63e-34.

So B = (6.63e-34 * 1.158e11) / 2.

6.63 * 1.158 = let me calculate. 6 *1.158=6.948, 0.63 *1.158= approx 0.63*1=0.63 and 0.63*0.158=0.099. So 0.63 +0.099=0.729. So 6.948 +0.729=7.677.

So 7.677e-34+11=7.677e-23. Divide by 2:3.8385e-23 J.

Then, to get B in Hz:

3.8385e-23 /6.63e-34 = (3.8385 /6.63 )e11.

3.8385 /6.63 ≈ 0.5787.

So 0.5787e11 =5.787e10 Hz.

Still, that's approximately 5.787e10, which is about 5.79e10. But the options don't have that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the approach.

Wait, maybe the formula isn't B= ν/2. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: I remember that the spacing between adjacent lines in rotational spectroscopy is 2B in frequency terms. Because
