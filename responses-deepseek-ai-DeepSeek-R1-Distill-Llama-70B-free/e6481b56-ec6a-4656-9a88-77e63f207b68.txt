Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating Mary O' Grady's gross earnings for the week. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step. I'm a bit new to payroll calculations, so I need to be careful.

First, the problem says Mary worked 44 hours during a regular Monday-Friday week. Her regular rate is $3.10 an hour. I remember that in many jobs, if you work over 40 hours in a week, the extra is overtime, usually paid at time and a half. So for the regular week, she worked 44 hours. That means 40 are regular hours and 4 are overtime.

Wait, but the problem also mentions she worked on Saturday and Sunday. Oh right, because weekends might have different pay rates. Let me make sure I get all the details right.

Her pay structure is as follows:
- Time and a half for all hours over 40 during the regular week.
- Time and a half for all Saturday work.
- Double time for Sunday work.

So I need to calculate each part separately and then add them all up.

Let me start with the regular week. She worked 44 hours. So 40 hours at regular pay, and 4 hours at time and a half.

Regular pay for 40 hours: 40 * $3.10. Let me calculate that. 40 * 3 is 120, and 40 * 0.10 is 4, so total $124.

Overtime for 4 hours: Time and a half means 1.5 times her regular rate. So 4 * (3.10 * 1.5). Let's compute 3.10 * 1.5 first. 3 * 1.5 is 4.5, and 0.10 *1.5 is 0.15, so 4.65 per hour. Then 4 * 4.65 is... 4 *4 is 16, 4 *0.65 is 2.6, so total 18.6. So $18.60 for overtime.

So total for the regular week is 124 + 18.6 = $142.60.

Now for Saturday. She worked 4 and a half hours. The problem says all Saturday work is paid at time and a half. So each hour on Saturday is 3.10 * 1.5. As before, that's 4.65 per hour.

So 4.5 hours * 4.65. Let's calculate that. 4 hours would be 4 *4.65 = 18.60, and 0.5 hours is 2.325. Adding them together: 18.60 + 2.325 = 20.925. So approximately $20.93 for Saturday.

Then Sunday, she worked 3 hours and it's double time. Double time means twice her regular rate, so 3.10 * 2 = $6.20 per hour. 3 hours *6.20 = 18.60. So $18.60 for Sunday.

Wait, let me double-check these calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Regular week:
40h *3.10 = 124.00
4h * (3.10 *1.5) = 4h *4.65 = 18.60
Total: 142.60

Saturday:
4.5h *4.65 = 20.925 → 20.93 (I think it's okay to round to two decimal places since it's money)

Sunday:
3h *6.20 = 18.60

Now add all these together: 142.60 + 20.93 + 18.60.

Let me add step by step. 142.60 +20.93 = 163.53. Then 163.53 +18.60 = 182.13.

Wait, so the total would be $182.13. Let me look at the options. Option D is $182.13. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Did I account for all the hours correctly?

Regular week: 44 hours → 40 regular, 4 OT. Correct.

Saturday: 4.5 hours, all at time and a half. Correct.

Sunday: 3 hours, double time. Correct.

Calculations:

Regular pay: 40 *3.10 = 124.

OT: 4 * (3.10 * 1.5) = 4*4.65=18.6 → total regular week: 142.6.

Sat:4.5 *4.65=20.925 → 20.93.

Sun:3*6.20=18.60.

Total: 142.6 +20.93=163.53 +18.6=182.13.

Yes, that seems right. So the answer should be D.

Mary O' Grady's gross earnings for the week are calculated as follows:

1. **Regular Week (Monday-Friday):**
   - She worked 44 hours, with the first 40 hours paid at the regular rate of $3.10/hour.
   - Regular pay: \( 40 \times 3.10 = 124.00 \).
   - Overtime for 4 hours (time and a half): \( 4 \times (3.10 \times 1.5) = 4 \times 4.65 = 18.60 \).
   - Total for the regular week: \( 124.00 + 18.60 = 142.60 \).

2. **Saturday:**
   - She worked 4.5 hours, all paid at time and a half.
   - Pay rate: \( 3.10 \times 1.5 = 4.65 \).
   - Total for Saturday: \( 4.5 \times 4.65 = 20.93 \).

3. **Sunday:**
   - She worked 3 hours, all paid at double time.
   - Pay rate: \( 3.10 \times 2 = 6.20 \).
   - Total for Sunday: \( 3 \times 6.20 = 18.60 \).

4. **Total Gross Earnings:**
   - Sum of all components: \( 142.60 + 20.93 + 18.60 = 182.13 \).

Thus, Mary's gross earnings for the week are **$182.13**.

The correct answer is **D**.
