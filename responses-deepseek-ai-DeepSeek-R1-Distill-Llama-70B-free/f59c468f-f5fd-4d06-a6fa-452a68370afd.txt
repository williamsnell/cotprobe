C: It is located at -20 and is to the left of point A on the numberline.
D: It is located at -25 and is to the left of point A on the numberline.
E: It is located at -30 and is to the left of point A on the numberline.
F: It is located at -15 and is to the left of point A on the numberline.
G: It is located at -20 and is to the right of point A on the numberline.
H: It is located at -15 and is to the right of point A on the numberline.
I: It is located at -25 and is to the right of point A on the numberline.

Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says that Point A and Point B are on a number line. Point A is at -20. Point B is 5 less than Point A. I need to determine which statement about Point B is true, choosing from options A to J.

Hmm, wait. Let me make sure I understand. So Point B is 5 less than Point A. Point A is at -20. So if B is 5 less than A, I subtract 5 from A's position, right?

Wait, no. Wait, the wording is crucial here. "Point B is 5 less than point A." So that would mean B is A minus 5. Because if A is a certain value, subtracting 5 gives a smaller value. But wait, in terms of number lines, smaller numbers are to the left, and larger to the right.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. So Point A is at -20. If Point B is 5 less than A, that means B is at A's position minus 5. So, mathematically, B = A - 5. So substituting A as -20, B would be -20 -5 = -25. So Point B is at -25.

Now, where is that in relation to Point A? On a number line, as numbers increase, you move to the right. So -25 is to the left of -20 because it's a smaller number. So Point B is at -25, which is to the left of Point A.

Now I need to look at the options and see which one matches this.

Looking at the options:

Option D: It is located at -25 and is to the left of point A on the numberline. That fits what I found.

Let me double-check the other options just to be sure. Option E says -30 and left, which would be even further left, but that's if you subtract 10, not 5. Option I says -25 but to the right, which can't be because -25 is less than -20. So D is correct.

The correct answer is D. Point B is located at -25, which is 5 units to the left of Point A (-20) on the number line.

Answer: D
