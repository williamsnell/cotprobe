Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again.

The question says: The group velocity of light in a certain substance is found to vary inversely with wavelength. How does the index of refraction vary with wavelength? And then there are 10 options provided.

Hmm, right. I remember that group velocity is related to the speed of light in a medium, and the index of refraction comes into play here. Let me think about the relationships between these quantities.

So, the group velocity (v_g) is the derivative of the angular frequency with respect to the wave number, but I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here. Wait, another approach: I think the group velocity is related to the phase velocity. Oh right, the phase velocity v is c/n, where n is the refractive index. But group velocity is a bit different.

Wait, I remember that for non-dispersive media, group velocity equals phase velocity, but in general, it's different. Oh, but maybe in this problem, we can assume some relationship. Alternatively, maybe I should recall that group velocity v_g is equal to c divided by the derivative of n with respect to the wavelength. Or was it the derivative of the wave number? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting a bit confused here.

Wait, another approach. Let me think about the basic formulas. The phase velocity v_p is given by v_p = c/n. And the group velocity v_g is given by v_g = dω/dk, where ω is angular frequency and k is wave number. But since ω = 2πf and k = 2π/λ, I think there's a way to relate these.

Wait, another formula I remember is that v_g = v_p (1 + (λ/n)(dn/dλ))^-1. Or maybe it's v_g = v_p [1 + (λ dn/dλ)]^-1. Hmm. But I'm not entirely confident about that formula.

Wait, maybe it's better to start from Maxwell's equations and the relation of group velocity. Oh, wait, group velocity is also given by the derivative of the angular frequency with respect to the wave number: v_g = dω/dk. But in a medium, the wave number k is (nω)/c, I think. Or wait, k = (2πn)/λ, but λ is the wavelength in vacuum. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express the group velocity in terms of the refractive index. Let me try to find how v_g relates to n.

Wait, another formula comes to mind: v_g = c/(n + λ dn/dλ). Yeah, I think that's correct. So, group velocity v_g is equal to the speed of light in vacuum divided by (n plus the derivative of n with respect to λ multiplied by λ). Or wait, is it (n + λ dn/dλ) or something else? Let me make sure.

I think it's v_g = c / (n + λ dn/dλ). So, v_g = c / (n + λ dn/dλ). Okay, that sounds right.

Now, the problem states that the group velocity varies inversely with the wavelength. So, v_g is inversely proportional to λ. That means v_g = k / λ, where k is some constant.

So, substituting this into the equation for v_g:

k / λ = c / (n + λ dn/dλ)

Wait, but we can write this as:

n + λ dn/dλ = c λ / k

Hmm, but I'm not sure about the exact expression here. Let me think again. Maybe it's better to write it as v_g proportional to 1/λ. So, v_g = C/λ, where C is a constant.

So, substituting into v_g = c/(n + λ dn/dλ):

C/λ = c/(n + λ dn/dλ)

Wait, but perhaps it's better to write it as an equation:

v_g = C / λ, where C is a constant.

So,

C/λ = c/(n + λ dn/dλ)

Rearranging terms:

n + λ dn/dλ = c λ / C

Hmm, but I don't know the value of C, but perhaps it's better to look for a differential equation in terms of n and λ.

Let me rewrite the equation:

n + λ dn/dλ = (c/C) λ

Let me set (c/C) as another constant, say K. So,

n + λ dn/dλ = K λ

This is a differential equation. Let me write it as:

λ dn/dλ + n = K λ

Hmm, that's a first-order linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) for n as a function of λ. Let's try to solve this ODE.

The standard form for a linear ODE is:

dn/dλ + P(λ) n = Q(λ)

Let me rearrange the equation:

λ dn/dλ = (K λ - n )

Divide both sides by λ:

dn/dλ = K - n/λ

Let me rewrite it:

dn/dλ + (1/λ) n = K

Yes, now it's in the standard linear form. So P(λ) = 1/λ, and Q(λ) = K.

The integrating factor (IF) is exp( ∫ P(λ) dλ ) = exp( ∫ (1/λ) dλ ) = exp( ln λ ) = λ.

Multiply both sides by the IF (λ):

λ dn/dλ + n = K λ

Wait, but that's the same as the original equation. Alternatively, perhaps I should proceed correctly.

Wait, the standard method says that after finding the IF, multiply both sides by it.

So, after multiplying:

λ dn/dλ + n = K λ

The left side is the derivative of (n * IF) with respect to λ. Because d/dλ (n * λ) = λ dn/dλ + n.

So,

d/dλ (n λ) = K λ

Integrate both sides:

n λ = ∫ K λ dλ + constant

Integrate:

n λ = (K/2) λ² + C

Then, solve for n:

n = (K/2) λ + C / λ

Hmm, so n is equal to (K/2)λ plus some constant divided by λ.

Wait, but the question is about how n varies with λ. Let me think about this solution.

n = (K/2) λ + C / λ

So, n is a linear combination of λ and 1/λ. But looking at the options, none of them seem to directly match this form. Let me see the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option A: n = λ/(a + b λ²)
Option B: n = λ²/(a + b)
Option C: n = λ/(a - b λ²)
Option D: n = (a + b)/λ
Option E: n = a λ² - b/λ
Option F: n = (a λ²)/(1 + b λ)
Option G: n = (a - b λ)/λ²
Option H: n = 1/(a λ + b λ³)
Option I: n = 1/(a + b λ²)
Option J: n = a + b λ

Hmm. None of these options exactly match n = (K/2) λ + C/λ. So perhaps I made a mistake in my approach.

Wait another thought: Maybe I should have considered the relation between group velocity and refractive index differently. Let me reconsider.

Another approach: The group velocity v_g is the derivative of the frequency with respect to the wave number, v_g = dω/dk.

In a medium, the wave number k is given by k = n k_0, where k_0 = 2π/λ is the vacuum wave number. And ω is related to the frequency f by ω = 2πf.

In vacuum, c = λ f, so f = c/λ. In a medium, the phase velocity v_p is c/n, and the frequency remains the same as in vacuum, so f = v_p / λ_medium? Wait, no, wait. The frequency doesn't change when light enters a medium; only the wavelength and speed change. So, f = v_p * n / λ, maybe? Hmm, perhaps I'm getting a bit tangled here.

Wait, perhaps it's better to express ω in terms of k and n. Since in a medium, the relation between ω and k is ω = v_p * k, where v_p is the phase velocity. But v_p is c/n, so ω = (c/n) k.

But k in the medium is n k_0, where k_0 is the vacuum wave number. Wait, so k = 2π n / λ. Hmm, perhaps that's the case.

Wait, let me clarify. The wave number in the medium is k = n k_0, where k_0 = 2π/λ_0, and λ_0 is the wavelength in vacuum. So, k = n (2π/λ_0) ).

But since λ_0 = λ/n (because λ = λ_0 / n), then substituting back, k = 2π n / (λ_0) ) = 2π n^2 / λ.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating things here. Let me try to connect ω and k.

In a medium, ω = v_p * k. And v_p = c/n, so ω = (c/n) k.

But k is related to the wavelength in the medium, which is λ = λ_0 / n. So, k = 2π / λ = 2π n / λ_0. So, substituting into ω:

ω = (c/n) * (2π n / λ_0) ) = (2π c) / λ_0.

Which makes sense because the frequency doesn't depend on the medium. So, ω is the same as in vacuum, which is correct.

Wait, but how does this help me find the group velocity? Because group velocity is dω/dk.

So, let's compute dω/dk.

We have ω = (c/n) k.

But if n is a function of λ, and λ is related to k, perhaps we can write n as a function of k.

Wait, but k = 2π / λ. So, λ = 2π /k.

But n could be a function of λ, which is a function of k. So, n = n(λ(k)).

Wait, perhaps it's easier to express n as a function of k.

So, ω = (c/n) k.

Then, dω/dk = c [ (1/n) + k (-1/n²) dn/dk ) ]

Hmm, because d/dk [ (c/n) k ] is c [ (1/n) + k (-1/n²) dn/dk ) ].

So,

v_g = dω/dk = c [ (1/n) - (k/n²) dn/dk ]

But the problem states that v_g is proportional to 1/λ. Since λ = 2π /k, then 1/λ = k/(2π). So, v_g is proportional to k. So, v_g = C * k, where C is a constant.

Thus,

c [ (1/n) - (k /n²) dn/dk ] = C k

Divide both sides by c:

(1/n) - (k /n²) dn/dk = (C/c) k

Hmm, perhaps I can write (C/c) as another constant, say K.

So,

(1/n) - (k /n²) dn/dk = K k

Let me rearrange terms:

- (k/n²) dn/dk = K k - 1/n

Multiply both sides by -n²/k:

dn/dk = [ (1/n) - K k ] * (n²/k )

Simplify:

dn/dk = (n^2/k) (1/n - K k )

= (n^2/k) * (1/(n) - K k )

= (n^2/k) * [ (1 - K k n ) / n ]

Wait, that seems a bit messy. Let me compute it step by step.

Wait, [1/n - K k ] = (1 - K k n)/n.

So,

dn/dk = (n^2 /k ) * (1 - K k n ) / n )

= (n^2 /k ) * (1 - K k n ) / n

= (n /k ) * (1 - K k n )

= (n/k)(1 - K k n )

Hmm, not sure if this is getting me anywhere. Perhaps I should consider a substitution.

Alternatively, maybe using a different approach. Let's think about the relation between group velocity and refractive index again.

Wait, another formula I found earlier was v_g = c / (n + λ dn/dλ ). So, if v_g is proportional to 1/λ, then:

v_g = C / λ.

So,

C / λ = c / (n + λ dn/dλ )

Rearranging:

n + λ dn/dλ = c λ / C

Let me define C' = c/C, so:

n + λ dn/dλ = C' λ

This is the same ODE as before. So, solving this ODE should give me the dependence of n on λ.

As before, the solution was:

n = (C' / 2) λ + D / λ,

where D is the constant of integration.

Hmm, but looking at the options, none of them directly match this form. So perhaps I should consider a possible simplification.

Wait, in the solution, n is a sum of terms proportional to λ and 1/λ. Let me see if any option can match this.

Looking at the options:

Option I: n = 1/(a + b λ^2 )

Hmm, if I have n proportional to 1/(something with λ^2), perhaps that's not directly matching.

Option J: n = a + b λ. That's linear in λ.

Option A: n = λ/(a + b λ^2 ). So, n is λ divided by (a + b λ²).

Hmm, perhaps I can manipulate the solution I found to see if it can be expressed in terms of one of these options.

Wait, the solution I have is:

n = (K/2) λ + D / λ.

But none of the options have both λ and 1/λ terms. So perhaps I made a mistake in the setup.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the group velocity varies inversely with wavelength. So, v_g = C / λ, with C being a constant.

Wait, but from v_g = c/(n + λ dn/dλ ), substituting:

C/λ = c/(n + λ dn/dλ )

Which gives:

n + λ dn/dλ = c λ / C.

Let me denote K = c/C, so:

n + λ dn/dλ = K λ.

This is a first-order linear ODE, which I solved earlier, getting n = (K/2) λ + D/λ.

Hmm, perhaps in the problem, the dependence is different, such that one term dominates, or perhaps the solution can be manipulated to fit into one of the given options.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the problem is considering a specific form. Let's try to assume that n is proportional to 1/(a + b λ² ), as in option I.

Let me suppose n = 1/(a + b λ² ). Then, what would be the group velocity?

Compute v_g using v_g = c/(n + λ dn/dλ ).

First, compute dn/dλ:

dn/dλ = d/dλ [1/(a + b λ^2)] = (-1)(2b λ)/(a + b λ^2 )^2.

So, λ dn/dλ = (-2b λ^2 )/(a + b λ^2 )^2.

Then, n + λ dn/dλ = [1/(a + b λ^2 ) ] + [ (-2b λ^2 )/(a + b λ^2 )^2 )

= [ (a + b λ^2) - 2b λ^2 ] / (a + b λ^2 )^2

= [a - b λ^2 ] / (a + b λ^2 )^2

So,

v_g = c / [ (a - b λ^2 ) / (a + b λ^2 )^2 ) ]

= c (a + b λ^2 )^2 / (a - b λ^2 )

Hmm, but according to the problem, v_g is proportional to 1/λ. So,

v_g = C / λ.

So, we have:

c (a + b λ^2 )^2 / (a - b λ^2 ) = C / λ.

Hmm, but this would require that (a + b λ^2 )^2 / (a - b λ^2 ) is proportional to 1/λ. Let me see if that's possible.

Wait, but 1/λ is λ^(-1), while the left side is a function of λ^2. So, unless this function somehow reduces to a term involving 1/λ, which doesn't seem likely. So perhaps option I is not the solution.

Let me try another option. Let's try option I: n = 1/(a + b λ^2 )

Wait, I just did that, but the result didn't fit. Hmm.

Another approach: Let's suppose that n is proportional to 1/(something). Let's try option A: n = λ / (a + b λ^2 ).

Compute v_g = c/(n + λ dn/dλ )

First, compute dn/dλ:

n = λ/(a + b λ^2 )

So, dn/dλ = [ (1)(a + b λ^2 ) - λ (2b λ) ] / (a + b λ^2 )^2

= [ a + b λ^2 - 2b λ^2 ] / (a + b λ^2 )^2

= [ a - b λ^2 ] / (a + b λ^2 )^2

Then, λ dn/dλ = [ a - b λ^2 ] * λ / (a + b λ^2 )^2

Now, n + λ dn/dλ = [ λ/(a + b λ^2 ) ] + [ λ (a - b λ^2 ) / (a + b λ^2 )^2 ]

Let me write both terms with a common denominator:

= [ λ (a + b λ^2 ) + λ (a - b λ^2 ) ] / (a + b λ^2 )^2

= [ λ a + λ b λ^2 + λ a - λ b λ^2 ] / (a + b λ^2 )^2

Simplify numerator:

λ a + λ a + (λ b λ^2 - λ b
