Okay, so I've got this accounting question in front of me, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read it again.

The question is about Cooley Co. and their unrealized gain on a debt investment classified as available-for-sale. The gain is $100,000, and the corporate tax rate is 25%. I need to figure out how much of this gain affects their net income and other comprehensive income for the year.

Hmm, right. I remember that investments can be classified into different categories, like trading, available-for-sale, and held-to-maturity. Available-for-sale is the one where the investment isn't intended to be held until maturity, but also isn't actively traded for short-term gains. So, I think the accounting treatment is that unrealized gains and losses are recorded, but not directly into net income. Instead, they go into other comprehensive income.

Wait, but wait. How does tax come into play here? Because even though the gain is unrealized, sometimes taxes might be affected. Oh right! For available-for-sale securities, the unrealized gains and losses are reported in other comprehensive income, and these are considered after-tax amounts. Because the company hasn't actually sold the investment, so the tax impact is deferred.

So, the process is that the company would recognize the gain, but since it's unrealized, it goes to OCI. But they also have to account for the tax effect. So the gain is $100,000, and the tax rate is 25%, so the tax would be $25,000. But wait, how does that affect the amounts?

I think the logic here is that the gain is unrealized, so it's not part of net income. Instead, the entire $100,000 gain is recorded as an unrealized gain in OCI, but because taxes would be owed when the gain is realized, the current tax impact is recognized. So, the net effect in OCI is the gain minus the tax, which would be $75,000. But wait, no, wait—unrealized gains on available-for-sale are recorded net of tax in OCI.

Wait, no, actually, let me get this straight. The initial gain is $100k. Since it's unavailable for sale, the gain is not realized, so net income doesn't include it. But for comprehensive income, the gain is recognized, but it's adjusted for the tax effect. So the company would debit the investment account for $100k, credit an unrealized gain account for $100k. But then, because taxes are deferred, they have to do something about the tax impact.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of journal entries. So for an available-for-sale security, when the value increases, you record:

Debt Investment (asset) increases by $100k.

Unrealized Gain-Loss (which is in OCI) increases by $100k.

But then, because of taxes, you also have to record the tax liability. So, the tax expense is $25k (25% of 100k). But wait, since this is a deferred tax liability, because the gain is unrealized, the tax hasn't been paid yet. So the company would recognize the tax expense in net income, but also a deferred tax liability on the balance sheet.

Wait, no—wait, for available-for-sale, the unrealized gains are included in OCI, which is after-tax. So the gain is $100k, the tax on that is $25k, so the net amount in OCI is $75k, and the tax expense is $25k, which affects net income.

Wait, no, I'm getting mixed up. Let's think again.

When an available-for-sale investment has an unrealized gain, the gain is added to comprehensive income, but after considering the tax effect. So the total gain is $100k, and the tax on that is $25k. So the net gain in OCI is $75k.

So, the net income is not affected by the gain because it's unrealized. The tax expense for the period would include the tax on realized gains, but since this is unrealized, the tax is deferred, so it's part of the deferred tax liability.

Wait, but how does that affect net income? Oh, right, the company's net income is only affected by realized gains and losses, not the unrealized ones. So the net income wouldn't include the $100k gain, but the other comprehensive income would include the after-tax gain.

So the breakdown would be: Net income is $0 (since the gain is unrealized and not part of net income), and other comprehensive income is $75k (because $100k gain minus 25% tax, which is $25k, so 75k net). Wait, but wait, is that correct? Or is the other comprehensive income the full $100k, but then the tax is also accounted for in the comprehensive income?

Wait, no, other comprehensive income includes the after-tax effect. So the $100k gain is before tax, and then the tax is $25k, so the net after-tax is $75k, which goes to OCI.

So, the net income is zero because the gain is unrealized. The other comprehensive income is $75,000. Hmm, but looking at the options, I don't see an option with 0 and 75k.

Wait, the options are:

Option H: $0 $75000.

Is that correct? So in that case, the correct answer would be H?

Wait, but let me make sure. Because sometimes, the treatment might be different. For instance, for available-for-sale, the unrealized gains go to OCI, and the tax effect is calculated and recorded as a deferred tax asset or liability. So perhaps the tax is considered in the OCI as well.

Wait, another approach: The unrealized gain is $100k. The company must recognize this gain as part of comprehensive income. However, because taxes are based on realized gains, the company must also recognize a deferred tax liability.

So, the company would make the following entries:

1. Increase the investment account by $100k (Debit).
2. Credit Unrealized Gain (OCI) for $100k.
3. Since the gain will be taxable when realized, a deferred tax liability of $25k (25% of 100k) is created.
4. Debit Tax Expense for $25k, and credit Deferred Tax Liability for $25k.

Wait, but that would mean that the tax expense is $25k, which would reduce net income. So net income would have a tax expense of $25k, but that's on the realized gains, not on the unrealized.

Wait, no, because the $25k is deferred, it doesn't impact net income. Or does it?

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me think about the tax treatment. Unrealized gains on available-for-sale are recognized in OCI, and the tax impact is also recognized in OCI, but as a deferred tax.

Alternatively, the tax is considered a deferred tax item. So the $100k gain is in OCI before tax, and the tax is $25k, which is a deferred tax, so the net in OCI is $75k.

So, in terms of comprehensive income, which includes net income and OCI, the net income doesn't include the gain, and the OCI includes $75k. But wait, no, comprehensive income includes the net income plus the OCI items. But in this case, the net income is unaffected by the gain, because it's unrealized.

Wait, no, the net income would have a tax expense of $25k because of the deferred tax liability, but that's not correct because the gain hasn't been realized yet. So the tax hasn't been paid; it's only a deferred liability.

Wait, perhaps the tax doesn't affect net income. Let's think again.

The unrealized gain on an available-for-sale security is recorded as a credit to Unrealized Gain-Loss in OCI. Then, the tax effect is recognized as a deferred tax liability. So, the journal entry would be:

Debit Investment (Available-for-Sale) $100,000

Credit Unrealized Gain-Loss (OCI) $100,000

Then, for the tax effect:

Debit Deferred Tax Asset or Credit Deferred Tax Liability? Hmm.

Wait, since the gain is unrealized, when the company eventually sells the investment for a gain, they'll have to pay taxes on that gain. So the deferred tax liability represents the taxes that will be owed in the future.

So the entry would be:

Debit Deferred Tax Liability $25,000

Credit Income Tax Expense $25,000

Wait, no, wait. The tax expense would be on the income statement, but this is a deferred tax item. So perhaps the correct entry is:

Debit Deferred Tax Liability $25,000

Credit Income Tax Expense (Deferred) $25,000

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think of it in terms of comprehensive income.

The comprehensive income is calculated as net income plus other comprehensive income. In this case, the $100k gain is part of OCI, but after tax.

So the net income is not affected by the gain, because it's unrealized. The tax expense in net income is zero because the gain is unrealized. The $100k gain is in OCI, but the tax is 25% of that, so $25k. So the net amount in OCI is $75k. 

Wait, but is the tax considered an expense in net income? Or is it considered as part of the OCI adjustment?

I think the tax is considered as part of OCI. So the net income is unaffected, and the OCI is $75k.

So looking at the options, which option has Net income 0 and OCI 75k?

Looking back, option H is $0 and $75000. So the correct answer would be H.

But wait, another thought: Maybe the entire $100k is in OCI, and the tax is treated as a deferred tax liability which is reported on the balance sheet, but doesn't affect the income statement or comprehensive income. Hmm, that doesn't seem right because the tax effect should reduce the net gain in OCI.

Wait, no, I think the correct approach is that the gain is $100k, and the tax is $25k, so the net gain in OCI is $75k. So yes, option H.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing up the treatment. Let me recall: For available-for-sale securities, any unrealized gains and losses are reported in OCI, net of taxes. So the company's comprehensive income includes the after-tax effect of the gain, not the pre-tax.

So, the gain is $100k, tax is $25k, so after-tax is $75k, which goes to OCI. The net income doesn't include the gain, so it's zero.

So the correct answer is H: $0 and $75000.
</think>

During the current year, Cooley Co. had an unrealized gain of $100,000 on a debt investment classified as available-for-sale, with a corporate tax rate of 25%. For available-for-sale securities, unrealized gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income (OCI), not net income, and the tax impact is deferred. The tax effect of the gain is calculated as $25,000 (25% of $100,000). 

The $100,000 gain is reduced by the tax effect, resulting in a net after-tax gain of $75,000, which is reported in OCI. Since the gain is unrealized, it does not affect net income. Therefore, net income remains $0, and the OCI is $75,000.

The correct answer is:

H: $0 $75000

Answer: H
