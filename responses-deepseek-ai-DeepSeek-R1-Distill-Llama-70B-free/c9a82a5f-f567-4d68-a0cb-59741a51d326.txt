Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the photoelectric effect. Hmm, I remember that the photoelectric effect involves electrons being ejected from a metal when light shines on it. The key idea is that the energy of the incoming photons has to be greater than the work function of the metal for electrons to be emitted. Oh wait, the work function is the minimum energy needed to eject an electron.

The problem gives me magnesium with a work function phi of 3.7 eV. And the ultraviolet light has a frequency of 1.5 × 10^15 sec^-1. I need to find the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons.

I think the formula I need is the photoelectric equation: the energy of the photon (E) equals the work function (phi) plus the maximum kinetic energy (K_max) of the electrons. So E = phi + K_max. Rearranging that, K_max = E - phi.

Wait, how do I find the energy of the photon from the frequency? Oh right, the energy E is given by E = h * f, where h is Planck's constant. I remember h is approximately 6.626 × 10^-34 J·s. But wait, since the frequency here is given in 1e15 per second, I should calculate that.

Let me compute E first. So f is 1.5e15 Hz. So E = h*f. Plugging in the numbers: 6.626e-34 J·s * 1.5e15 1/s. Let's do that multiplication. 

6.626e-34 * 1.5e15 = (6.626 *1.5) * 1e( -34 +15 ) = 9.939e-19 J. Because 6.626 times 1.5 is about 9.939.

Wait, but I need to convert that energy from joules to electron volts because the work function is given in eV. I remember that 1 eV is 1.602e-19 J. So to convert E from J to eV, I divide by 1.602e-19 J/eV.

So E (eV) = 9.939e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV. Let me calculate that. 9.939 / 1.602 is approximately ... let's see, 1.602 times 6 is about 9.612. So 9.939 - 9.612 is 0.327. So 6 + 0.327/1.602 ≈ 6.2 eV. Hmm, wait, let me check. 1.602 * 6.2 equals 9.9364. Oh wait, wait, 1.602 *6=9.612, 1.602 * 0.2= 0.3204. So 9.612 +0.3204=9.9324. So 9.939e-19 J is approximately 6.2 eV. Let me compute it more accurately.

Wait 9.939 /1.602 = let's compute this. 1.602 *6=9.612. Subtract: 9.939-9.612=0.327. So 0.327 /1.602 = approx 0.204. So total is 6.204 eV, approximately 6.2 eV.

Wait wait, wait, wait. Let me compute this more accurately. Let me do 9.939e-19 J /1.602e-19 J/eV. The exponents cancel, so 9.939 /1.602 = ?

So 1.602 times 6 is 9.612. So 9.939 -9.612=0.327. So 0.327 divided by 1.602 is approximately 0.204. So about 6.204 eV. Let's say approximately 6.2 eV.

Wait, but wait, I'm pretty sure that 1.5e15 Hz is in the ultraviolet range. Because visible light is about 4e14 to 8e14 Hz, so 1.5e15 is higher, which makes sense for UV.

So the photon energy E is approximately 6.2 eV. The work function phi is 3.7 eV. So the maximum kinetic energy K_max is E - phi. So 6.2 eV -3.7 eV = 2.5 eV.

Looking at the options, option J is 2.5 eV. So the answer should be J.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistake.

Calculating E again: h=6.626e-34 J·s. f=1.5e15 1/s. So E = h*f =6.626e-34 *1.5e15 = (6.626 *1.5) *1e-19 = 9.939e-19 J.

Convert to eV: 9.939e-19 J / 1.602e-19 J/eV = 9.939 /1.602 ≈6.205 eV.

So K_max =6.205 -3.7=2.505 eV, which is approximately 2.5 eV. So option J is correct.

To determine the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons ejected from magnesium when irradiated by ultraviolet light, we use the photoelectric equation:

\[
E = \phi + K_{\text{max}}
\]

Where:
- \(E\) is the energy of the incoming photon,
- \(\phi\) is the work function of magnesium (\(3.7 \, \text{eV}\)),
- \(K_{\text{max}}\) is the maximum kinetic energy of the ejected electrons.

The energy of the photon is calculated using the relation \(E = h \cdot f\), where \(h\) is Planck's constant (\(6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J·s}\)) and \(f\) is the frequency of the light (\(1.5 \times 10^{15} \, \text{Hz}\)):

\[
E = (6.626 \times 10^{-34}) \cdot (1.5 \times 10^{15}) = 9.939 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}.
\]

To convert this energy into electron volts (eV), we divide by the conversion factor \(1 \, \text{eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{J}\):

\[
E = \frac{9.939 \times 10^{-19}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.2 \, \text{eV}.
\]

Now, substituting into the photoelectric equation to find \(K_{\text{max}}\):

\[
K_{\text{max}} = E - \phi = 6.2 \, \text{eV} - 3.7 \, \text{eV} = 2.5 \, \text{eV}.
\]

Thus, the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons is approximately \(2.5 \, \text{eV}\), which corresponds to option **J**.
