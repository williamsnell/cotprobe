Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about calculating the lowest natural frequency for an automobile engine spring. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

Alright, the problem gives me some details. The spring is made of spring steel, has 10 active coils, a mean diameter of 3.5 inches, and a wire diameter of 0.20 inches. I need to find the natural frequency, and the options are given from A to J.

Wait, right. The natural frequency of a spring-mass system is given by a specific formula, isn't it? I think it's something like f equals some constants divided by the square root of a term involving mass. Oh wait, but wait, for a spring, maybe it's different. Oh right, for a helical spring, the natural frequency formula involves the wire diameter, the mean diameter, the number of coils, and maybe some material properties.

Wait, the formula I remember is f = (1/(2π)) * sqrt(k/m), where k is the spring constant and m is the mass. But wait, in this problem, I don't have the mass. Oh wait, maybe I'm supposed to calculate the spring constant k using the given spring parameters, and then perhaps assume the mass is the mass of the spring itself, or maybe the formula for the natural frequency of the spring without an added mass? Hmm, I'm a bit confused.

Wait no, I think for a helical compression spring, the formula for natural frequency (when considering it as a spring-mass system, where the mass is the mass of the spring) is given by f = (1/(2π)) * sqrt((Gd^4)/(8nD^3m)), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe there's a more straightforward formula.

Wait, I think I might have gotten this reversed. Another approach: the natural frequency (in Hz) of a spring is given by f = (1/(2π)) * sqrt(k/m). But without the mass m, perhaps the question is assuming the mass of the spring itself. Alternatively, maybe the formula is different for the spring's natural frequency when it's considered as a system. Hmm.

Alternatively, I recall that for a helical spring, the shear modulus G is involved. The formula for the spring constant k is k = (G * d^4) / (8 * n * D^3), where d is wire diameter, D is the mean diameter, and n is the number of active coils.

But wait, to find the natural frequency, I probably need to calculate k first and then use the formula f = (1/(2π)) * sqrt(k/m). But without knowing the mass m, I'm stuck. Unless the problem provides a standard value for the mass, but I don't see that in the question.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the question is referring to the natural frequency of the spring when it's considered as a beam, like a cantilever or something. But that doesn't quite fit. Alternatively, maybe the formula for the natural frequency of a helical spring is f = (1/2π) * sqrt(k/m). But again, without m, I can't proceed.

Wait, maybe the question is using a different approach. Oh, perhaps the formula for the natural frequency of a spring is f = (1/2π) * sqrt((G * d^4) / (8 * n * D³ * m)). But again, without the mass, I can't compute this. Unless m is the mass per unit length or something else.

Wait, perhaps the question is assuming that the mass m is the mass of the spring. But then I need to find the mass, which would require knowing the density of the spring steel. Do I know that? Hmm, spring steel's density is around 8000 kg/m³, I think. Or wait, steel's density is about 7850 kg/m³. Let me check that assumption.

Wait, if I can calculate the mass of the spring, then I can plug it into the formula. So, the mass m of the spring would be the volume of the wire times the density. The wire is a cylinder, so the volume is the length of the wire times the cross-sectional area.

The length of the wire can be found from the number of coils and the mean diameter. So each coil has a circumference of π*D, right? So for n coils, the length L is L = π * D * n. 

So D is 3.5 inches, which I should convert to meters. Oh wait, but wait, the wire diameter is given in inches too. So perhaps I should work in inches and then convert units as needed, but that might get messy. Alternatively, convert all measurements to SI units.

Let me list the given data:

n = 10 active coils.

Mean diameter D = 3.5 inches = 0.0889 meters (since 1 inch is 0.0254 m).

Wire diameter d = 0.20 inches = 0.00508 meters.

Material: spring steel. So modulus of rigidity G for steel is about 80 GPa, or 80e9 Pa.

Density ρ for steel is 7850 kg/m³.

So first, calculate the spring constant k.

The formula for k is k = (G * d^4) / (8 * n * D^3).

Plugging in the numbers:

G = 80e9 Pa,

d = 0.00508 m,

n = 10,

D = 0.0889 m.

Calculating numerator: G * d^4 = 80e9 * (0.00508)^4.

Let me compute (0.00508)^4 first. 0.00508 is 5.08e-3.

(5.08e-3)^4 = (5.08)^4 * (1e-3)^4 = approx 5.08^4 is 5.08 *5.08=25.8, 25.8 *25.8≈665.6. So 665.6e-12, which is 6.656e-10.

Wait wait, let me compute more accurately:

5.08^1 =5.08

5.08^2=5.08*5.08=25.8064.

5.08^3=25.8064 *5.08. Let's compute 25 *5=125, 0.8064*5≈4.032, 25*0.08=2, 0.8064*0.08≈0.0645. So adding up, 125+4.032+2+0.0645≈131.0965. Wait, perhaps I should just use a calculator approach.

Alternatively, 5.08^4 = (5.08²)² = (25.8064)^2.

25.8064 squared: 25^2=625, 0.8064^2≈0.6499, and the cross terms: 2*25*0.8064=40.32. So 625 +40.32 +0.6499≈665.9699.

So (5.08e-3)^4 = 665.9699e-12 = 6.659699e-10 m^4.

So G*d^4 =80e9 Pa *6.6597e-10 m^4 = 80e9 *6.6597e-10.

Compute 80e9 =8e10, 8e10 *6.6597e-10 = 8 *6.6597e0 = 53.2776.

So numerator is ~53.2776.

Denominator:8 *n *D^3.

8 *10=80.

D^3= (0.0889 m)^3.

0.0889^3: Let's compute 0.08^3=0.000512, 0.09^3=0.000729. 0.0889 is close to 0.089, so 0.089^3 = approx 0.000705.

Wait, more accurately: 0.0889 *0.0889 =0.007905, then *0.0889: 0.007905 *0.0889 ≈ 0.000703 m³.

So denominator:80 *0.000703 =0.05624.

So k=53.2776 /0.05624 ≈ (53.2776 /0.05624) ≈ let's compute 53.2776 ÷ 0.05624.

Well, 0.05624 is approximately 5.624e-2.

53.2776 /0.05624 ≈ 53.2776 /0.05624 ≈ let's see, 53 /0.05 is 1060. But more accurately:

0.05624 * 947 ≈ let's see, 0.05624 * 900 = 50.616, 0.05624*47≈2.643, total 53.259. So 947 gives 53.259, which is very close to 53.2776.

So k≈947 N/m.

Wait, let me make sure. 53.2776 divided by 0.05624 is approximately 947 N/m.

Okay, now I have k. Next, I need the mass m to find the natural frequency. The formula is f = (1/(2π)) * sqrt(k/m).

But I don't have m. Hmm. Unless the question expects me to use the mass of the spring itself. Let me think.

The mass of the spring is the volume of the wire multiplied by the density. The wire is a cylinder, so volume V = π*(d/2)^2 * length L.

Wait, the length L is the length of the wire, which for a spring is the number of coils times the circumference of each coil. Each coil's circumference is π*D, so L = n * π * D.

So L =10 * π *0.0889 m.

Compute L: 10 * π ≈31.4159, 31.4159 *0.0889 ≈2.796 m.

Wait, 0.0889 m is about 3.5 inches, so 10 coils would give a wire length of 10 * π*3.5 inches. But I think I converted D correctly to meters.

So L≈2.796 meters.

Then, the volume V = π*(d/2)^2 * L.

d =0.00508 m, so radius is d/2=0.00254 m.

Area A=π*(0.00254)^2 ≈3.1416*(6.45e-6) ≈2.026e-5 m².

Volume V = A * L =2.026e-5 *2.796 ≈5.66e-5 m³.

Then mass m = V * density =5.66e-5 m³ *7850 kg/m³ ≈0.444 kg.

So m≈0.444 kg.

Now, putting it into the natural frequency formula:

f = (1/(2π)) * sqrt(k/m) = (1/(2π)) * sqrt(947 /0.444).

Compute 947/0.444 ≈2131.53.

sqrt(2131.53)≈46.16.

So f≈46.16/(2π)≈46.16/6.283≈7.35 Hz.

Wait, but the options given don't have 7 Hz. Hmm, that's confusing. Maybe I made a mistake in calculations.

Wait, let me double-check the calculations.

Wait, first, calculating k: G*d^4/(8*n*D^3).

G was 80e9 Pa, d=0.00508 m, D=0.0889 m, n=10.

Compute d^4: (0.00508)^4.

Let me calculate 0.00508^2 = (5.08e-3)^2 = 25.8064e-6.

Then (5.08e-3)^4 = (25.8064e-6)^2 = approx 6.66e-9 m^4.

Wait wait, no: 25.8064e-6 squared is (25.8064)^2 * (1e-6)^2 = 665.97 * 1e-12 = 6.6597e-10 m^4.

So G*d^4=80e9 *6.6597e-10 =80e9 *6.6597e-10 = 80 *6.6597e-1 = 5.32776e0 =53.2776 N·m².

Denominator:8*n*D^3 =8*10*(0.0889)^3.

0.0889^3 =0.0889 *0.0889 *0.0889.

Compute 0.0889 *0.0889 first: 0.00790521.

Then 0.00790521 *0.0889 ≈0.000703 m³.

Multiply by 8*10:80 *0.000703=0.05624 m³.

So k=53.2776 /0.05624 ≈947 N/m.

That seems correct.

Then m: volume of wire is π*(d/2)^2 * L.

L=10*pi*D=10*pi*0.0889≈2.796 m.

Radius d/2=0.00254 m. Area=pi*(0.00254)^2≈3.1416*(6.45e-6)≈2.026e-5 m².

Volume V=2.026e-5 *2.796≈5.66e-5 m³.

Density rho=7850 kg/m³.

m=5.66e-5 *7850≈0.444 kg.

So k/m=947/0.444≈2131 s^-2.

sqrt(2131)= approx 46.16 rad/s.

f=1/(2pi) *46.16≈7.35 Hz.

But none of the options are near 7. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption.

Wait the question is about the natural frequency of the engine spring. Maybe I should have considered the spring's natural frequency without the mass, but that doesn't make sense because frequency depends on mass. Alternatively, perhaps the formula I used is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the formula for the natural frequency isn't using the spring's own mass, but rather the formula is for a spring-mass system where m is the mass attached to the spring. But the problem doesn't specify a mass, so perhaps I'm supposed to use a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe the formula for the natural frequency of a spring is f = (1/2π) * sqrt(k/m), but k is the spring constant, and m is the mass attached. But without m, perhaps the question expects a different formula.

Wait, I think I might have mixed up the formula. Let me look up the correct formula for the natural frequency of a helical spring.

Wait, another approach: The natural frequency (fn) of a helical spring can be calculated using the formula:

fn = (1/(2π)) * sqrt( (Gd^4)/(8nD^3m) )

But this requires m, which I don't have. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is expressed differently.

Wait, maybe I should use the formula for the natural frequency of a spring without an added mass. But I don't recall that being a standard approach. Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the mass m is the mass of the vehicle's engine, but that's not given either.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the mass of the spring. Perhaps the problem doesn't require the mass, and I should use a different formula that doesn't involve mass, but I can't recall such a formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula for the natural frequency of a helical spring is given by:

f = (1/2π) * sqrt( (G * d^4) / (8 * n * D^3 * I) )

Where I is the moment of inertia. But I don't think that's correct. Alternatively, maybe it's a different formula for the transverse natural frequency, treating the spring as a beam.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to think of another approach. Maybe the question is using the formula for the natural frequency in terms of the spring index and other factors.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the formula for the natural frequency of a spring is:

f = (1/(2π)) * sqrt( (k) / m )

But again, without m, I can't compute it. But perhaps the question is using the spring's own mass as m, which I calculated as 0.444 kg, leading to f ≈7.35 Hz. But that's not an option here.

Wait the options are 12,15,17, etc. So 7 Hz isn't present, so I must have made a mistake.

Alternative approach: Perhaps I should use the formula for the natural frequency of a spring in another way, maybe considering the shear modulus and the geometry without involving mass.

Wait, I think I found another formula for the natural frequency of a helical spring:

f = (1/(2π)) * sqrt( (G * d^4) / (8 * n * D^3 * m) )

But I still don't have m. So perhaps the question expects me to use a standard mass for the engine, but that's not specified.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm confusing the formula. Maybe the natural frequency of a spring is given by:

f = (1/(2π)) * sqrt( (k) / (m) )

But again, without m, I can't proceed. So this approach is stuck.

Wait, perhaps the question is referring to the resonant frequency when the spring is considered as a cantilever beam. The formula for the fundamental natural frequency of a cantilever beam is:

f = (1/(2π)) * sqrt( (3EI)/(m L^3) )

But E is the modulus of elasticity, I is the moment of inertia, m is mass per unit length, and L is length.

But that's a different scenario, and I don't know if that's applicable here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the shear stress and then find the natural frequency based on that, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should try to compute the period of vibration and then take reciprocal to get frequency. But without knowing mass, I don't think that's feasible.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of the spring constant k. Let me double-check.

k = (G * d^4) / (8 * n * D^3 )

G =80e9 Pa,

d=0.00508 m,

n=10,

D=0.0889 m.

Compute d^4: (0.00508)^4.

Let me compute (0.00508)^2 = 0.0000258064.

Then (0.
