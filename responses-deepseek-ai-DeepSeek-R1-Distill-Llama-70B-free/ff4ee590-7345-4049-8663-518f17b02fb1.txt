Okay, so I've got this question about quantization error and mean-square error. Hmm, I'm a bit new to this topic, but let me try to think it through.

The question is asking me to determine the mean-square quantization error when the error is equally likely to be anywhere between -S/2 and +S/2, where S is the step size. The options are various fractions of S squared.

Wait, I remember that mean-square error (MSE) is like the average of the square of the error values. Since the error is uniformly distributed, I think I need to calculate the average of e² over the interval from -S/2 to S/2.

So, the formula for mean-square error when the error is uniformly distributed should be the integral of e squared times the probability density function (pdf) over that interval. Since the error is equally likely, the pdf is constant. 

What's the pdf here? For a uniform distribution between a and b, the pdf is 1/(b-a). In this case, a is -S/2 and b is S/2, so the range is S. Therefore, the pdf is 1/S.

So the MSE would be the integral from -S/2 to S/2 of (e^2) * (1/S) de. Let me set that up: (1/S) * ∫(e²) de from -S/2 to S/2.

Wait, integrating e squared. The integral of e² is (e^3)/3, evaluated from -S/2 to S/2. Let me compute that.

So substituting S/2: ( (S/2)^3 ) /3. And substituting -S/2: ( (-S/2)^3 ) /3. Wait, but when I subtract, I have to do [ (S/2)^3 /3 - ( (-S/2)^3 )/3 ].

But wait, (-S/2)^3 is negative because it's an odd power. So let's compute each part:

(S/2)^3 = S³/(8)
Similarly, (-S/2)^3 = -S³/(8)

So when we subtract: [ (S³/8)/3 ) ] - [ (-S³/8)/3 ) ] = (S³/(24)) - (-S³/24) )= S³/(24) + S³/(24) = S³/(12).

So the integral becomes (1/S) * (S³ /12) ) because I have to multiply by 1/S.

So (1/S) * S³/12 = S²/12.

Wait, that gives me S squared over twelve. So looking at the options, option B is S²/12.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes I heard the formula is S²/12 for uniformly distributed error. But I should make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes.

Let me go through the integral again. The function is e squared, which is even, so integrating from -a to a is twice the integral from 0 to a.

So alternatively, I can compute 2 * integral from 0 to S/2 of e² (1/S) de.

Integral of e² de is e^3/3. Evaluated from 0 to S/2 gives ( (S/2)^3 ) /3 = S³/(24).

Multiply by 2: 2*(S³/(24*S)) )? Wait, no, the 1/S is multiplied. Wait, perhaps I should recompute.

Wait, the integral is (1/S) * ∫ (-S/2 to S/2) e² de.

Which is (1/S) * [ ( (S/2)^3 /3 ) - ( (-S/2)^3 /3 ) ) ]

Which is (1/S) * [ (S³/24) - ( - S³/24 ) ] = (1/S) * ( S³/12 ) ) = S²/12. Yeah, same as before.

So the mean square error is S squared over twelve. So the correct answer is option B.

To determine the mean-square quantization error (MSE) during the quantization of a signal, we assume the error is uniformly distributed between \(-S/2\) and \(+S/2\), where \(S\) is the step size. The MSE is calculated as the average of the square of the error values over this interval.

For a uniform distribution, the probability density function (pdf) is constant and given by:

\[
\text{pdf} = \frac{1}{b-a} = \frac{1}{S},
\]

where \(a = -S/2\) and \(b = S/2\). The MSE is then expressed as:

\[
\text{MSE} = \int_{-S/2}^{S/2} e^2 \cdot \text{pdf} \, de = \frac{1}{S} \int_{-S/2}^{S/2} e^2 \, de.
\]

The integral of \(e^2\) is \(\frac{e^3}{3}\). Evaluating this from \(-S/2\) to \(S/2\):

\[
\int_{-S/2}^{S/2} e^2 \, de = \left[ \frac{e^3}{3} \right]_{-S/2}^{S/2} = \frac{(S/2)^3}{3} - \frac{(-S/2)^3}{3}.
\]

Since \((-S/2)^3 = -S^3/8\), this simplifies to:

\[
\int_{-S/2}^{S/2} e^2 \, de = \frac{S^3}{24} - \left(-\frac{S^3}{24}\right) = \frac{S^3}{12}.
\]

Substituting this result back into the MSE formula:

\[
\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{S} \cdot \frac{S^3}{12} = \frac{S^2}{12}.
\]

Thus, the mean-square quantization error is \(S^2/12\), which corresponds to option **B**.
