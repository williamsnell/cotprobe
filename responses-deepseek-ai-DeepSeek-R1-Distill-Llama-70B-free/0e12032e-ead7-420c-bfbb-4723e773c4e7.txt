Question:

A housing corporation owned farmland and prepared a development plan to divide the land into 100 lots and create a residential community on the farmland tract. The Declaration of Covenants created the community association, as an administrative entity, to which the residential community lot owners would pay dues, and which would administer and enforce the regulations and restrictions recited among the covenants. One of the restrictions set forth in the Declaration of Covenants provides that the lots be used only for single-family residences, and that no trade, commerce, or business may be conducted in any single-family residence. The Declaration of Covenants gives the community association the right to assign all of its rights, powers, titles, easements, and estates granted to it under the Declaration of Covenants. The community association assigned "all the rights, powers, titles, easements, and estates granted to or conferred upon it by the Declaration of Covenants" to a municipal corporation, the city. The community association was then terminated. A chef, the owner of lot 18 in the residential development, proposes to convert his single-family dwelling into a massage parlor. The city asserts an action against the chef to recover money damages. Which of the following is the best argument for the chef?

Options:

A: The restraint on alienation of his land is invalid.
B: The Declaration of Covenants is unenforceable because it is overly restrictive.
C: The Declaration of Covenants does not explicitly prohibit the conversion of single-family dwellings into businesses.
D: The chef has the right to use his property as he sees fit, regardless of the Declaration of Covenants.
E: The benefit is in gross; hence, the burden cannot run.
F: The chef was not aware of the Declaration of Covenants when he bought the property.
G: The assignment of rights to the city was invalid because the community association was terminated.
H: The burden is in gross; hence, the benefit cannot run.
I: The city is not in privity of estate with community association.

Okay, so I've got this question about real covenants and property law. Hmm, let's try to break it down. 

The situation is that a housing corporation owns some farmland and decides to develop it into 100 residential lots. They create a Declaration of Covenants which sets up a community association. The association is supposed to manage the enforcement of the covenants. One of the key restrictions is that each lot can only be used for single-family residences, and no businesses are allowed. 

So the chef owns lot 18 and wants to turn his house into a massage parlor. The city is suing him to stop that. The question is about the chef's best argument against this action.

I remember that for a covenant to run with the land, certain criteria must be met. There's the requirement that the covenant must "touch and concern" the land. Also, the original parties must have intended it to run, and it has to be in writing, usually recorded.

In this case, the community association assigned all its rights to the city. Now, the city is trying to enforce the covenant. So the issue is whether the city has the right to enforce this covenant after the assignment.

I think about the types of covenants. There are real covenants and equitable servitudes. Real covenants require horizontal privity (original parties must be in a mutual estate) and vertical privity (succession of interest). Equitable servitudes can be enforced regardless of privity if certain conditions are met.

Wait, but the assignment here is from the community association to the city. The community association was created by the Declaration, so it's the original party. When they assign their rights, does that transfer properly?

I remember that when a covenant is in gross, it doesn't run with the land because it's a personal right. But if it's a covenant that runs with the land, it can be assigned. But wait, the problem says the community association was terminated after assigning the rights. So does that affect the assignment?

Wait, there's a concept about whether the party enforcing the covenant is in privity with the original covenantee. The city, as the assignee, would need to have some kind of privity. But the community association and the city might not be in privity because the association is terminated. Or maybe the city is taking as an assignee, which might be okay.

Another point: the Declaration says the association can assign all its rights. So the assignment was valid. But when the association is terminated, does that make the assignment ineffective? Or does the termination happen after the assignment, so the city already has the rights?

Wait, the problem says the association assigned the rights and then was terminated. So the termination happened after the assignment. So the city already has the rights. Therefore, termination of the association wouldn't affect the city's rights.

Hmm, but I'm not sure. Maybe the termination affects whether the city can enforce it. Alternatively, perhaps the city isn't the right kind of entity to hold such a covenant. 

Wait, another angle: the benefit and burden of a covenant. For a covenant to run, the benefit must run with the land. If the benefit is in gross, meaning it's personal to the covenantee, then it can't run. But if it's appurtenant, it benefits the land.

Here, the community association's covenants are for the benefit of all lot owners. So each lot owner gets the benefit. When the association assigns the right to the city, the question is whether the city has the benefit. If the benefit is in gross, meaning it's not tied to any land, then the burden can't run. Wait, no, the burden is on the chef's land, so if the benefit is in gross, the city might not have standing.

Wait, but the city is a municipal corporation. They might not have a direct interest in the land. So if the benefit of the covenant was intended for the lot owners, assigning it to the city, which isn't a lot owner, might mean that the city doesn't have the benefit appurtenant to any land. So the benefit would be in gross. 

I'm a bit confused. Let me think: when a covenant is appurtenant, it benefits the land, so the covenantee must own land that is benefited. If the city doesn't own any land in the development, then the benefit is in gross. So the city can't enforce the covenant because it's in gross, meaning it's a personal right, not attached to land.

Wait, but the original covenant was for the benefit of all lot owners. So when the association assigns to the city, does the city step into the shoes of the association? Or does it matter that the city isn't a lot owner?

I think the key point is that the benefit of the covenant runs with the land. If the association's assignment to the city makes the city the holder of that benefit, but if the city doesn't have any land that's appurtenant (i.e., the city doesn't own a lot in the development), then the benefit is in gross. Because the benefit isn't attached to any specific parcel of land that the city owns. So the burden can't run because the benefit isn't appurtenant.

So the chef's argument would be that the benefit is in gross, hence the burden cannot run. Looking at the options, option E says "The benefit is in gross; hence, the burden cannot run." That sounds right.

Alternatively, option I says the city isn't in privity of estate with the community association. Privity might not be the main issue here. The issue is whether the benefit is appurtenant or in gross.

So the best argument would be E.

The question revolves around the enforceability of a covenant restricting the use of residential lots to single-family homes and prohibiting business activities. The community association, tasked with enforcing these covenants, assigned its rights to the city before being terminated. The chef, a lot owner, proposes to convert his residence into a massage parlor, and the city seeks to enforce the covenant. The chef's best argument hinges on whether the city has the legal right to enforce the covenant after the assignment.

For a covenant to be enforceable, the benefit of the covenant must "run with the land." This requires the benefit to be appurtenant (attached to land) rather than in gross (a personal right). Here, the original covenant was intended to benefit all lot owners, making it appurtenant. However, when the community association assigned its rights to the city, the city, as a municipal corporation, does not own any land in the development. Without owning land that directly benefits from the covenant, the benefit becomes in gross for the city. Since the burden of the covenant cannot run if the benefit is in gross, the city lacks standing to enforce the covenant.

Among the options provided, the best argument for the chef is that the benefit is in gross, and hence, the burden cannot run. This aligns with option E.

E: The benefit is in gross; hence, the burden cannot run.
