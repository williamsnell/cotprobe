Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm supposed to find the sum of a few numbers and then write it in standard form. Let me read the question again to make sure I get all the details right.

The problem says: An office building has 300,000 plus 5,000 plus 600 plus 10 square feet of floor space. I need to find the total square footage and then pick the correct option from A to J.

Alright, so the numbers to add are 300,000, 5,000, 600, and 10. Let me write them down:

300,000
+ 5,000
+ 600
+ 10
_________

Hmm, I think I can add them step by step. Maybe I'll start from the largest number and work my way down. So first, 300,000 plus 5,000. Let me do that: 300,000 + 5,000 is 305,000. That makes sense because adding five thousand to three hundred thousand just increases it by five, making it 305,000.

Now, the next number is 600. So I add that to 305,000. Let's see: 305,000 + 600. Well, 305,000 plus 600 is like adding 0.6 thousand. So that would be 305,600. Wait, no, wait. 305,000 plus 600 is 305,600? Wait, no, that doesn't sound right. Because 305,000 plus 600 is just 305,600. Yeah, that's correct.

Wait, no, wait a minute. Because 305,000 plus 600 is 305,600. Because 600 is six hundred, so adding that to 305,000 brings it up by 600. So yes, 305,600.

Now, the last number is 10. So I add 10 to 305,600. That's straightforward: 305,600 + 10 equals 305,610. So the total floor space is 305,610 square feet.

Now, I need to present this number in standard form. Wait, standard form usually refers to writing the number without commas, just the digits with the correct places. But sometimes, people use standard form to mean the number with commas as thousand separators. Let me think. In the context of multiple-choice options, the answer choices have commas, so probably the standard form here includes the commas.

Looking at the options:

Option A: 3,561 → That's way too small.
Option B: 30,561,000 → That's over 30 million, way bigger than our sum.
Option C: 30,561 → Still too small.
Option D: 35,610,000 → Again, way too big.
Option E: 3,056,100 → That's over three million, which is more than our sum.
Option F: 300,561 → Oh, wait, that's 300 thousand plus. Our sum is 305,610, so this is less than that.
Option G: 305,61 → Hmm, that's only 305,61, which is 30561, which is way too small.
Option H: 305,610 → That matches exactly what I calculated.
Option I: 35,610 → That's 35 thousand, which is much smaller.

So the correct answer must be option H: 305,610.

Wait, but let me double-check my addition to be sure I didn't make a mistake. So 300,000 + 5,000 is 305,000. Then adding 600 gives 305,600, and adding 10 gives 305,610. Yep, that's correct.

The total floor space is calculated by adding the given numbers:

300,000  
+ 5,000  
+ 600  
+ 10  
= 305,610  

In standard form with commas, the number is written as **305,610**, which corresponds to option H.

Answer: H
