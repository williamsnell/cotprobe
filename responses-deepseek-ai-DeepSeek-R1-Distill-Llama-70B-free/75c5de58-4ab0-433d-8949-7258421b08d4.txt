Question:

Using a marginal utility approach, explain why air, so vitally important to the maintenance of life, is free.

Options:

A: Air is free because it regenerates itself too quickly to be priced.
B: Air is free because it can't be packaged and sold
C: Air is free because it's abundant
D: Air is free because its marginal utility remains constant, regardless of consumption.
E: Air is free because its marginal utility is zero, it is not a scarce good.
F: Air is free because the cost of production is zero.
G: Air is free because no one owns it
H: Air is free because the technology to control its distribution does not exist.
I: Air is free because it is impossible to measure its utility.
J: Air is free because it is a fundamental human right.

Okay, so I have this economics question about why air is free using the marginal utility approach. Hmm, marginal utility is about the additional satisfaction a person gets from consuming one more unit of a good. So, I remember that in economics, things are priced based on their marginal utility. If something has high marginal utility, people are willing to pay more for it.

Wait, but why is air free then? Air is super important because we need it to breathe. Without it, we can't live. So why isn't it priced?

Let me think about the options. The question gives options from A to J. I need to pick the correct one based on marginal utility.

Option A says air is free because it regenerates quickly. I'm not sure about that. I mean, air does get replenished naturally, but that might not directly relate to marginal utility. Maybe it's more about supply being abundant.

Option B: Can't be packaged and sold. Well, actually, oxygen is sold in tanks for medical use or welding. So that can't be the reason. Plus, the question is about air in general, not just packaging.

Option C: Air is free because it's abundant. That makes sense. If something is abundant, the supply is more than enough to meet demand. So each additional unit (marginal) doesn't add much value because there's so much of it. So marginal utility would be low, even zero, making it free.

Option D: Marginal utility remains constant. No, that doesn't sound right. If you're suffocating, the next breath has high utility. But when you have plenty, each breath's utility decreases. So marginal utility decreases with consumption.

Option E: Marginal utility is zero, not scarce. Wait, air is scarce in the sense that we can't live without it, but in terms of economics, scarce goods are those where needs exceed availability. Wait, but in normal circumstances, air is so plentiful that it's not scarce. So maybe its marginal utility is zero because the next unit doesn't add any satisfaction. But wait, when you need air, the first units are very valuable. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Option F: Cost of production is zero. Air isn't produced, so the cost is zero. That might be a reason, but does that tie into marginal utility? I think marginal utility is more about consumer demand rather than production cost.

Option G: No one owns it. That's more about property rights. If it's a public good, it's not owned, so it's free. But the question is about marginal utility, so maybe this isn't the right approach.

Option H: Technology doesn't exist to control distribution. Well, that's not true. We can control air distribution in specific contexts, like oxygen tanks. But in general, it's everywhere so controlling it isn't feasible. But again, this is more about supply than marginal utility.

Option I: Can't measure utility. No, we can measure how much someone needs air, but that's not why it's free.

Option J: Fundamental human right. That's a rights-based reason, not an economic one. The question is about marginal utility, so this isn't the answer.

So, back to the main point. Marginal utility approach says that the price of a good is determined by its marginal utility. If the marginal utility is zero, people won't pay for it. So, if air is so abundant that each additional unit doesn't add any utility, then the price is zero. So, why is the marginal utility zero?

Because in most situations, air is so plentiful that the next breath doesn't add any extra satisfaction. You have all you need, so the marginal utility is zero. Hence, it's free. So that would point towards option E or C.

Wait, option E says "its marginal utility is zero, it is not a scarce good." So, because it's not scarce, the marginal utility is zero. But is that correct? Actually, when something is non-scarce, the marginal utility diminishes to zero. So, yes, that fits.

Option C says it's abundant. Abundance leads to zero marginal utility, making it free. So both C and E seem related. But the question is about the marginal utility approach. So, the reason is that the marginal utility is zero, which makes it not scarce in economic terms. So, option E is more directly tied to marginal utility.

Wait, but another thought: in economics, scarcity is about when needs exceed availability. But air is so abundant that it's not scarce. So, because it's a free good, not an economic good. Economic goods are scarce. Non-economic goods are those where supply is more than demand, so they have zero price.

So, using marginal utility, the marginal utility of air is zero beyond a certain point because we have more than enough. So the price is zero. So, option E says "its marginal utility is zero, it is not a scarce good." That seems correct.

Wait, but option C says "because it's abundant." Which is true, but the reasoning is through abundance leading to zero marginal utility. So the correct answer from the options would be E.

Wait, let me double-check. If a good is abundant, its marginal utility is zero, making it free. So the reasoning is that because air's marginal utility is zero (because it's abundant), it's free. So the correct option would be E.

Wait, but option C says "abundant" as the reason. So the question is which is the better answer. The question is using the marginal utility approach. So the correct answer should focus on marginal utility, not just abundance.

So, the answer should be E: Air is free because its marginal utility is zero, it is not a scarce good.

Alternatively, another way: because the marginal utility of air is zero, it's not considered a scarce good, so it's free.

So, the correct answer is E.

Using a marginal utility approach, the price of a good is determined by its marginal utility, which is the additional satisfaction a consumer gains from one more unit of the product. Air, despite being vital for survival, is free because its marginal utility is effectively zero in most situations. This is due to its overwhelming abundance; in normal circumstances, the supply of air far exceeds demand, making each additional unit of air provide no additional satisfaction to consumers. As a result, air is not considered a scarce good in economic terms, and its price is zero.

Option E correctly captures this reasoning by stating that air is free because its marginal utility is zero, and it is not a scarce good. While abundance (Option C) is a related concept, the question specifically asks for an explanation based on marginal utility, making Option E the most precise answer.

Answer: E
