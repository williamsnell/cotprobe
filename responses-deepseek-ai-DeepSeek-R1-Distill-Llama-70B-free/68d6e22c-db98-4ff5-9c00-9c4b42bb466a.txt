Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about voting behavior in the United States, and I need to figure out which statement doesn't accurately describe it. Let me go through each option step by step.

First, I'll read the question again: Which statement does NOT accurately describe voting behavior? The options are A through D.

Starting with option A: "Registered voters between the ages of 35 and 45 are more likely to vote than those under 21." I remember that younger voters, especially those under 21 (like 18-20), tend to have lower voter turnout compared to older groups. Middle-aged voters, like 35-45, usually participate more because they might have more stable lives, families, and perhaps more awareness of issues affecting them. So A sounds accurate.

Option B: "A registered voter who has attained his or her GED is less likely to vote than a high school dropout." Wait, that seems off. I think higher education levels are associated with higher voter turnout. High school dropouts probably vote less than those who have a high school diploma or equivalent. So someone with a GED (which is equivalent) should be more likely to vote than a dropout. So B is saying the opposite, which would make it inaccurate.

Option C: "Registered voters are more likely to vote in general elections than in primary elections." That's something I've heard before. General elections, especially for president, have higher turnout than primary elections. Primaries are usually for party nominations and don't draw as many voters. So C is accurate.

Option D: "More women than men have voted in every presidential election since 1980." I recall that women have been voting at higher rates than men in recent decades. Since 1980, women's turnout has surpassed men's in each presidential election. So D is correct.

So the incorrect statement is B because it claims that GED holders are less likely to vote than dropouts, which contradicts the usual trend where more education (or equivalent) leads to higher voter participation.

The statement that does NOT accurately describe voting behavior in the United States is:

**B: A registered voter who has attained his or her General Educational Development (GED) is less likely to vote than a high school dropout.**

This is incorrect because individuals with a GED typically have higher voter turnout rates compared to high school dropouts, as educational attainment is positively correlated with voting likelihood.

Answer: B
