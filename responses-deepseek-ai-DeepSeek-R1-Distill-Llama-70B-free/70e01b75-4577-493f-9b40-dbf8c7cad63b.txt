Okay, so I've got this problem about determining the spacing of the (111) planes in CsBr, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let me see what I remember from my solid state chemistry class.

First, I think CsBr has a particular crystal structure. I remember that CsBr has a body-centered cubic (BCC) structure, but wait, no, isn't that CsCl? Hmm. Wait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Oh right! CsCl has a BCC structure, whereas CsBr and other similar salts might have a different structure. Or wait, maybe they're both BCC? No, I think for CsBr, the structure is actually face-centered cubic (FCC) or maybe simple cubic? I'm getting a bit mixed up here. Wait, no, I think the correct structure for CsBr is a face-centered cubic lattice. Or is it body-centered? I'm not 100% sure. Maybe I should double-check that in my notes.

Wait, another approach: the problem gives me the lattice parameter 'a' as 7.28 Å. So if I can figure out the structure, I can find the d-spacing for the (111) planes.

I remember that the d-spacing formula is given by the Miller-Bravais law: 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/a², but wait, that's only for simple cubic structures, right? Or is it for any cubic system? Oh wait, no, the formula for cubic systems is 1/d² = (h² + k² + l²)/(a²), but that's for simple cubic. If it's BCC or FCC, does that affect anything? Oh wait, no, because the Miller indices are based on the lattice parameters, which for cubic systems are all equal, so the formula holds regardless of whether it's BCC or FCC. So perhaps I don't need to worry about the exact structure beyond knowing the lattice parameter.

Wait, no, wait. The structure affects the possible reflections because of the structure factor. But for the d-spacing calculation, maybe the structure doesn't matter. Because d-spacing is a function of the Miller indices and the lattice parameter. So perhaps regardless of whether it's BCC or FCC, the calculation for the (111) planes would be the same as long as the lattice parameter 'a' is given.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should focus on the formula. So the formula for interplanar spacing in a cubic crystal is d = a / sqrt(h² + k² + l²). That's right. So for (111) planes, h=1, k=1, l=1. So substituting, d would be a divided by the square root of (1+1+1) = sqrt(3). So d = a / sqrt(3).

Given that a is 7.28 Å, let me compute that. So sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732. So 7.28 divided by 1.732. Let me calculate that: 7.28 / 1.732 ≈ 4.20 Å. So the d-spacing would be approximately 4.20 Å.

Looking at the options, option E is 4.20 Å, so that's the answer. But wait, I'm a bit confused about the structure again. Does the structure affect this calculation? Because in some structures, like BCC, the (111) planes might not be allowed due to extinction rules, but no, wait, extinction rules affect whether a reflection is observed, not the d-spacing itself. So the d-spacing calculation is purely based on the formula, regardless of the structure's allowed reflections.

So I think I'm confident that the correct answer is E: 4.20 Å.

To determine the spacing of the (111) planes in CsBr, we use the formula for interplanar spacing in a cubic crystal:

\[
d = \frac{a}{\sqrt{h^2 + k^2 + l^2}}
\]

Here, \(a = 7.28 \, \text{Å}\) is the lattice parameter, and for the (111) planes, the Miller indices are \(h = 1\), \(k = 1\), and \(l = 1\). Substituting these values:

\[
d = \frac{7.28}{\sqrt{1^2 + 1^2 + 1^2}} = \frac{7.28}{\sqrt{3}}
\]

The square root of 3 is approximately \(1.732\), so:

\[
d = \frac{7.28}{1.732} \approx 4.20 \, \text{Å}
\]

The structure of CsBr does not affect the calculation of \(d\)-spacing, as the formula depends only on the lattice parameter and the Miller indices. Therefore, the spacing of the (111) planes is approximately \(4.20 \, \text{Å}\).

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**E: 4.20 Å**
