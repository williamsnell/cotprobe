Okay, so I've got this genetics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again.

The question gives me two DNA strands: strand1 and strand2. Strand1 is the transcription template for the mRNA, which I remember means it's the strand that's complementary to the mRNA. So the mRNA is synthesized based on strand1.

The sequences are:
strand1: A T G C G C T A C G G C AAT
strand2: T A C G C G A T G C C G TTA

Wait, wait. I'm a bit confused. So in DNA, the strands are complementary. Strand1 is the template, so mRNA is made complementary to strand1, meaning that the mRNA sequence is the same as strand2, except that T is replaced by U in RNA.

But wait, no. Because DNA has strand1 and strand2. strand1 is the template, so mRNA is built based on that. So mRNA is complementary to strand1 and same as strand2, but with U instead of T.

Wait, no. Let me think. DNA strands are antiparallel and complementary. strand1 is 5' to 3', and strand2 is 3' to 5', or vice versa? Wait, the mRNA is synthesized in the 5' to 3' direction, so the template strand is read 3' to 5', and the mRNA is built as 5' to 3', complementary to the template.

So, for example, if the template strand is strand1, then mRNA is built as complementary to strand1.

But wait, looking at the given strands, I need to figure out the direction. Hmm, the question doesn't specify the direction, so I assume that the way it's written is 5' to 3'. So for strand1, the sequence is written from 5' to 3' as: A T G C G C T A C G G C AAT.

Wait, that seems a bit long. Let me count the letters. strand1: A T G C G C T A C G G C AAT. Wait, that's 13 characters. Let me recount: A (1), T(2), G(3), C(4), G(5), C(6), T(7), A(8), C(9), G(10), G(11), C(12), A(13), A(14), T(15). Oh wait, maybe I miswrote it. The actual question says:

strand1: A T G C G C T A C G G C AAT

Wait, maybe it's written as a sequence of bases, perhaps split into groups. Oh, maybe it's written as groups of 3 for codons or something. So perhaps it's ATG CGC TAC GGC AAT. Hmm, that makes more sense. So 5' ATG CGC TAC GGC AAT 3'. So strand1 is the template, and the mRNA will be complementary to that.

Wait, but mRNA is synthesized in the 5' to 3' direction, so the mRNA will be complementary to the template strand, which is strand1. So mRNA will have the same sequence as strand2, except that T's are replaced with U's.

Wait, I'm getting a bit tangled here. Let me think again. DNA has two strands: one is the template (strand1), and the other is the coding strand (strand2). The mRNA is synthesized using the template strand, so the mRNA sequence is complementary to strand1 and identical to strand2, except with U instead of T.

So, for example, if strand1 is 5' ATG CGC TAC ... 3', then the mRNA will be 5' AUG CGC UAC ... 3', but wait, no. Wait, no, strand1 is the template, so the mRNA is built as complementary to strand1. So if strand1's first three bases are ATG, then the mRNA's first codon would be CAT? Wait no, no.

Wait, the mRNA is built as complementary to the template strand, which is strand1. So for example, if strand1 has a sequence ATG, then the mRNA would have CAT complementary to it. But wait, no, because the mRNA is built in the 5' to 3' direction, so the mRNA is 5' sequence that is complementary to strand1's 3' to 5' sequence.

Wait, perhaps I should write out the strands. Let's say strand1 is the template, so the mRNA is made complementary to it. So if strand1 is 5' A T G C G C T A C G G C AAT 3', then the mRNA will be 5' [complementary bases] 3'. But since mRNA is built 5' to 3', the mRNA sequence would be the same as strand2, but with T replaced by U.

Wait, but strand2 is the complementary strand to strand1. So if strand1 is 5' ATGCGCTACGGCAAT 3', then strand2 would be 3' TACGCGATGCCATT 5'. So the mRNA, which is complementary to strand1, would be 5' UAACGCCAGTCAT 3'? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, perhaps I should write it step by step.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to write down the DNA sequences.

strand1: 5' A T G C G C T A C G G C A A T 3' (template strand)
strand2: 3' T A C G C G A T G C C G T T A 5' (coding strand)

Wait, but no. Because in DNA, the two strands are complementary and antiparallel. So if strand1 is 5' to 3', then strand2 is 3' to 5'.

But in this question, strand1 is the template, so the mRNA is built complementary to strand1. So the mRNA sequence would be the same as strand2, except that T's are replaced with U's.

Wait, strand2 is the coding strand. So mRNA is same as strand2, but with U instead of T.

So let me write down the DNA sequences.

strand1 (template): 5' ATGCGCTACGGCAAT 3'
strand2 (coding): 3' TACGCGATGCCATT 5'

Wait no, that can't be right. Because the two strands are complementary and antiparallel. So the correct way is: if strand1 is 5' ATG ... 3', then strand2 would be 3' TAC ... 5'.

So the coding strand is strand2, which runs 5' to 3' as the complement of strand1.

Wait, maybe the way the strands are presented is that they are both written 5' to 3'. No, that's not possible because DNA strands are antiparallel. So if strand1 is written 5' to 3', then strand2 must be written 3' to 5'.

Wait, perhaps the question lists the strands as strand1 and strand2, both written 5' to 3', but complementary. So for example:

strand1: 5' A T G C G C T A C G G C A A T 3'
strand2: 5' T A C G C G A T G C C G T T A 3'

Wait, but that can't be because they are supposed to be complementary. Let me check:

strand1: A T G C G C T A C G G C A A T
strand2: T A C G C G A T G C C G T T A

Wait, let's see: position by position. strand1 first base is A, strand2 first base T. So in the same position, but complementary.

Wait, no. Because if they are both written 5' to 3', then they can't be complementary in the same direction. Because DNA strands are antiparallel. So I think the correct way is that if strand1 is 5' to 3', strand2 is 3' to 5' and complementary.

So for example:

strand1 (5' to 3'): A T G C G C T A C G G C A A T
strand2 (3' to 5'): T A C G C G A T G C C G T T A

But in the question, the way they are written is:

strand1: A T G C G C T A C G G C AAT
strand2: T A C G C G A T G C C G TTA

Wait, maybe I can write out the sequences properly.

strand1: 5' A T G C G C T A C G G C A A T 3'
strand2: 3' T A C G C G A T G C C G T T A 5'

So the mRNA is synthesized using strand1 as the template. So the mRNA sequence would be complementary to strand1, but since mRNA is synthesized 5' to 3', the mRNA will be same as strand2, but with T replaced by U.

Wait, no. Because if strand1 is the template, the mRNA is built as complementary to strand1. So the mRNA sequence is the same as strand2, but with T→U.

Wait, strand2 is 3' T A C G C G A T G C C G T T A 5', but mRNA is 5' to 3', so the mRNA would be 5' UAACGCCAGTCAT... Hmm, maybe let me do this step by step.

Let me write out the mRNA sequence.

The mRNA is built complementary to strand1. So if strand1 is 5' A T G C G C T A C G G C A A T 3', then the mRNA would be 5' UAACGCCAU GGCATT 3'? Wait, no, because mRNA is built in the 5' to 3' direction, complementary to the template (strand1), which is in 3' to 5' direction when read as the template.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me think of the process: during transcription, RNA polymerase reads the template strand (strand1) in the 3' to 5' direction and builds the mRNA in the 5' to 3' direction. So the mRNA sequence will be the same as the coding strand (strand2), with T replaced by U.

Wait, yes, that makes sense. So the mRNA is the same as strand2, but with T→U.

So strand2 is given as T A C G C G A T G C C G T T A, but wait, I'm not sure about the exact sequence. Wait, the given strand2 is T A C G C G A T G C C G TTA. Oh wait, perhaps it's written as TACGCGATGCCGTTA.

Wait, perhaps I should split the DNA into codons for easier handling.

Wait, but in any case, the mRNA will be complementary to strand1, which is the template.

So the mRNA sequence is the same as strand2, except with T replaced by U.

So let's write down strand2 as a DNA strand: T A C G C G A T G C C G T T A.

Wait, if I write that as 5' → 3', then the mRNA would be 5' UAACGCCAU GGCATT? Maybe I'm complicating it.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to take the given strand2 sequence and replace T with U to get the mRNA.

Wait, given that, let's look at the strand2 sequence. The question says:

strand2 is T A C G C G A T G C C G TTA.

Wait, perhaps it's written as groups: TAC GCG ATG CCG TTA.

Wait, that would make it easier to convert into mRNA. So mRNA would be the same as strand2, with T→U, so: UAC GCG AUC CGU UUA.

Wait, but wait, no. Because mRNA is built based on the template. Another approach is to find the mRNA sequence by writing the complement of strand1, which is the same as strand2, then replace T with U.

So, let's write out the strand1 and its complement (strand2).

strand1: A T G C G C T A C G G C A A T
So, the mRNA would be complementary, so U A C G C G A U G C C G U U A.

Wait, that's a bit messy. Let me write it in DNA terms first.

strand1 (template): A T G C G C T A C G G C A A T (5'→3')
So the mRNA would be complementary to this, so in DNA terms it would be T A C G C G A T G C C G T T A (since DNA is complementary), but mRNA uses U instead of T, so the mRNA would be UA C G C G A U G C C G U U A.

Wait, but this is getting a bit tangled. Let me try to write the mRNA as 5' to 3': the mRNA is the complement of strand1, so it's the same as strand2 but with U instead of T.

Wait, strand2 is the coding strand, which is complementary to strand1, so the mRNA is the same as strand2 but with T→U.

So let's write strand2 as 5'→3': T A C G C G A T G C C G T T A.

So the mRNA would be 5' UA C G C G A U G C C G U U A 3'.

Wait, no, because mRNA is built in the 5'→3' direction. So if strand2 is 5' T A C G C G A T G C C G T T A 3', then the mRNA would be the same but with T→U: 5' U A C G C G A U G C C G U U A 3'.

Wait, but wait, that would make the mRNA sequence UA C G C G A U G C C G U U A, but I'm not sure if I'm grouping correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps I should write out the mRNA sequence as the complement of strand1, replacing T with U.

strand1: 5' A T G C G C T A C G G C A A T 3'
So the complement is 3' T A C G C G A T G C C G T T A 5'.

But mRNA is 5' to 3', so the mRNA is 5' A U A C G C C G T A G C G A T 3'? Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the actual process. The mRNA is synthesized from the template strand (strand1), so the mRNA will be complementary to strand1, but with U instead of T.

So, let's take each base of strand1 and write the complementary mRNA base.

strand1: A T G C G C T A C G G C A A T
complement: T A C G C G A T G C C G T T A

Wait, but mRNA is built in 5'→3' direction, so the mRNA is the same as the complement of strand1, but in 5'→3' orientation.

Wait, I'm getting myself confused again. Let me try another approach. Let's write the DNA strands as they are.

strand1 (template): 5' ATGCGCTACGGCAAT 3' (I'm grouping into 3-letter codons for easier reading)
strand2 (coding): 3' TACGCGATGCCATT 5'

But mRNA is 5' to 3', so the mRNA will be same as strand2, but with U replacing T, and 5'→3' orientation.

So if strand2 is 3' TAC GCG ATG CCG TTA 5', then the mRNA will be 5' UA C GCG AUC CGU UUA 3'.

Wait, but that would be the reverse complement. Hmm, perhaps I should reverse the complement.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to write the mRNA as the same as strand2, but with U instead of T.

Wait, let's see: strand2 is T A C G C G A T G C C G T T A.

So mRNA would be U A C G C G A U G C C G U U A.

Wait, but mRNA is read in 5'→3' direction. So the mRNA sequence would be 5' UA C G C G A U G C C G U U A 3'.

Wait, but that's 15 bases, so 5 codons.

So the mRNA codons would be UAC, GCG, AUC, GGU, UUA.

Wait, let me check:

mRNA: U A C | G C G | A U C | G G U | U U A.

So the codons are UAC, GCG, AUC, GGU, UUA.

Now, I need to find the corresponding tRNA anticodons and the amino acids.

So for each codon:

1. UAC: the anticodon is complementary, so AUR (I think tRNA anticodons are written 5' to 3', complementary to the codon). So UAC → anticodon would be AUG (since RNA pairs: mRNA UAC pairs with tRNA AUG).

Wait, wait. The tRNA anticodon is complementary to the mRNA codon. So for UAC, the anticodon is AUR (where R is the modified base, but in this case, we can just think of it as AUG).

Wait, no. Let me think: mRNA codon is 5' U A C 3', so the tRNA anticodon is 3' A U G 5', which is written as 5' G A U 3'.

Wait, but tRNA anticodons are written 5' to 3', so the anticodon for UAC would be GAU.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me recall: mRNA codon is in 5'→3' direction. The tRNA anticodon is in 3'→5' direction, so it's written as 5'→3' as the complement.

So, for the codon UAC (5' U A C 3'), the anticodon is 3' A U G 5', which is written as 5' G A U 3' (since we write it 5' to 3').

Wait, no, wait: the tRNA's anticodon is complementary to the mRNA codon. So mRNA codon is UAC (5'→3'), so the tRNA anticodon is 3' AUG 5', which when written 5'→3' is GAU.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify: the anticodon is complementary to the codon. If the codon is UAC, then the anticodon is AUG (since U pairs with A, A pairs with U, C pairs with G). So the tRNA anticodon is AUG.

Wait, but I think I'm mixing up
