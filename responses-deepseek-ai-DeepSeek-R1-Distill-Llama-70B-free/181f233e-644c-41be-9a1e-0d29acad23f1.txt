Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about telescopes. Hmm, let me think. I've studied optics before, so maybe I can figure this out.

Alright, the question says a beam of parallel rays, parallel to the axis, falls on the objective of a telescope. The telescope uses a Ramsden eyepiece and is adjusted so the final image is at infinity. Oh wait, I remember that when the image is at infinity, the eyepiece is set so that the intermediate image is at its focal point. That makes the eyepiece act like a magnifying glass or something.

The given data: the objective has a focal length of 30.00 cm. The eyepiece's common focal length is 6.0 cm each. Wait, the eyepiece is made of two lenses, right? In Ramsden design, the eyepiece has a field lens and an eye lens, each with focal lengths f1 and f2. But I think for a Ramsden eyepiece, the common focal length refers to the combined focal length, maybe. Or each lens has a focal length of 6 cm. Wait, I'm a bit confused here. Let me clarify.

Wait, the question says the common focal length of each of the lenses of the eyepiece is 6.0 cm. Oh, so each lens in the eyepiece (field and eye lens) has a focal length of 6 cm. So the eyepiece is made of two lenses, each with f=6 cm. But wait, in a Ramsden eyepiece, the two lenses are positioned in a specific way, right? The field lens is placed between the objective and the eye lens. The separation is such that the eye lens is one focal length beyond the field lens. But I'm not sure if that matters here.

The problem is asking for the diameter of the beam of light emerging from the telescope. The diameter of the objective is 3.0 cm. Hmm, I think the beam diameter relates to the magnification and the objective's size.

Wait, the telescope is set up so the image is at infinity. That usually means the eyepiece is focused at infinity, so the intermediate image is formed at the focus of the eyepiece. So the objective forms an image at the focal point of the eyepiece.

So the telescope is in normal adjustment for astronomical observing. The magnification comes into play here. Wait, but the question isn't about magnification, it's about the beam diameter.

I remember that the exit pupil is the image of the objective formed by the eyepiece. So the size of the exit pupil determines the maximum diameter of the beam that can enter the eye. The exit pupil's diameter is related to the objective's size and the magnification of the telescope.

Wait, the formula I think is that the exit pupil diameter D_exit is equal to (D_objective) / (magnification). Or maybe the other way around. Let me think. The magnification M is the ratio of the focal lengths: M = f_objective / f_eyepiece.

Wait, no, for telescopes, the magnification is given by M = f_obj / f_eyepiece. So if the eyepiece has a shorter focal length, the magnification is higher.

Wait, but the eyepiece is a combination of two lenses. Oh wait, the eyepiece's effective focal length is the focal length of the combination. So for a Ramsden eyepiece, the two lenses are separated by a certain distance. The effective focal length of the eyepiece is given by 1/f_eyepiece = 1/f1 + 1/f2, but wait, no, that's for a two-lens system in certain configurations. Wait, no, for a Ramsden eyepiece, the two lenses are in a specific arrangement. Let me think: the field lens and the eye lens. The effective focal length for the eyepiece would be f_eye = (f1 * f2) / (f1 + f2 + d), where d is the separation, but maybe in this problem, each lens has a focal length of 6 cm, so perhaps the eyepiece's overall focal length is different? Wait, no, the question says the common focal length of each of the lenses is 6.0 cm. So each lens has f=6 cm.

Wait, but in the Ramsden eyepiece, the two lenses are placed a certain distance apart. The field lens is placed so that the intermediate image is formed just inside its focal length, perhaps. But I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should think differently.

Wait, perhaps the telescope formula applies. The magnification M is f_objective / f_eyepiece. But what's the eyepiece's focal length? Each of its lenses is 6 cm. But the eyepiece is a combination of two lenses, so the effective focal length would be less than either. Wait, no, maybe in this problem, the eyepiece's focal length is 6 cm. Because sometimes, the eyepiece's focal length is given as the effective one. Hmm, the question states that the common focal length of each of the eyepiece's lenses is 6.0 cm. So perhaps the eyepiece's focal length is 6 cm. But I'm not entirely sure, but for the sake of moving forward, I'll proceed under that assumption.

Wait, no, wait. Another approach: the eyepiece is a diverging lens arrangement? No, no, both are converging. Because in a telescope setup, the eyepiece is usually a converging lens in the case of a Galilean telescope, but for a Keplerian (which uses two convex lenses), both are converging. So the eyepiece's effective focal length would be less than each individual lens. Wait, but each lens here is 6 cm. So if the eyepiece's focal length is 6 cm, then the magnification is 30 / 6 = 5x.

Wait, but if each lens is 6 cm, perhaps the eyepiece's focal length is 3 cm? Because when you have two lenses in a certain arrangement, the effective focal length is different. Alternatively, perhaps the eyepiece's focal length is 6 cm. I'm getting a bit stuck here.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the exit pupil. The exit pupil diameter is equal to the objective's diameter divided by the magnification. So D_exit = D_obj / M.

But wait, the exit pupil is also equal to (D_eyepiece) * (f_obj / (f_obj + f_eyepiece))), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, I think the exit pupil's diameter is given by (D_objective) / M.

So if I can compute the magnification, I can find the exit pupil diameter.

Wait, but the problem is about the diameter of the beam emerging. The exit pupil is that diameter. So that's what we're looking for.

So, first, compute M = f_obj / f_eyepiece.

But wait, what is f_eyepiece here? If each lens of the eyepiece has 6 cm focal length, what is the eyepiece's effective focal length?

Wait, the eyepiece is a two-lens system. For a Keplerian eyepiece (which uses two convex lenses), the effective focal length is given by:

1/f_e = 1/f1 + 1/f2 - d/(f1 f2), where d is the separation between the lenses. But in a Ramsden eyepiece, the separation is such that the field lens is placed one focal length beyond the objective's focal point. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused here.

Alternatively, perhaps the eyepiece's effective focal length is given by (f1 * f2) / (f1 + f2 + d), but without knowing d, I can't compute it. Wait, but the problem gives the common focal length of each lens as 6 cm but doesn't provide the separation. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something obvious.

Wait, perhaps the problem is assuming that the eyepiece's focal length is 6 cm, treating it as a single lens. Because the problem says the "common focal length of each of the lenses of the eyepiece is 6.0 cm." So maybe the eyepiece's effective focal length is 6 cm. Because each of its lenses is 6 cm, but arranged in a way that the overall is 6 cm. That's a bit confusing, but perhaps that's the assumption to make.

So if f_eyepiece is 6 cm, then the magnification M is 30 cm / 6 cm = 5x.

Then, the exit pupil diameter D_exit = D_objective / M = 3 cm / 5 = 0.6 cm. Wait, that's 6 mm, which seems small. But the options don't have 0.6 cm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, wait, maybe I got the formula wrong. Because I remember that the diameter of the exit pupil is D_objective * (f_eyepiece / f_objective). Wait, no, that might be the entrance pupil. Or perhaps I should think about the angular magnification and how it affects the beam.

Alternatively, perhaps the beam emerging from the eyepiece is determined by the eyepiece's focal length and the size of the image formed by the objective.

Wait, when the image is at infinity, the eyepiece is focused such that the image formed by the objective is at the focus of the eyepiece. So the objective forms an image at F_e (f_eyepiece) distance from the eyepiece.

Wait, no, the eyepiece's focal length is f_e. So the image formed by the objective is at the focal point of the eyepiece. So the distance between the objective and eyepiece would be f_obj + f_e.

But how does this relate to the diameter of the beam?

Hmm, maybe the beam diameter is determined by the eyepiece's lens. The eyepiece has a certain diameter, but the problem doesn't give that. Wait, but the diameter of the objective is 3 cm. The beam entering the telescope is parallel, so the objective focuses it to a point at its focal length, 30 cm away. Then the eyepiece, with f_e =6 cm, forms an image at infinity from that point.

Wait, in this configuration, the beam emerging from the eyepiece would be parallel, and its diameter would be determined by the size of the eyepiece's lens. But we don't know the diameter of the eyepiece. Hmm, that's a problem.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the magnification and how the beam expands. So the beam comes in with diameter D=3 cm. The magnification is M = f_obj / f_e =30/6=5. So the beam's diameter would be magnified by M, but since the image is at infinity, maybe the beam's diameter relates inversely to the magnification.

Wait, no, when the image is at infinity, the rays are parallel. So the diameter of the beam emerging would be determined by the eyepiece's aperture. But without knowing that, I'm stuck.

Wait, perhaps the diameter of the beam is the same as the diameter of the eyepiece's eye lens. But since we don't know that, maybe it's related to the objective's size and the magnification.

Wait, another approach: The diameter of the exit pupil is D_exit = (D_objective) * (f_e / f_obj) ). So that would be 3 cm * (6 /30) )= 0.6 cm. But again, that's 6 mm, which is smaller than the options given.

Wait, but the question is about the diameter of the beam emerging, not the exit pupil. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing concepts here.

Wait, the exit pupil is the diameter of the light beam that can enter the observer's eye. But the question is about the beam's diameter emerging from the telescope. Maybe that's the same as the exit pupil. But in that case, 0.6 cm is not among the options.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the calculation. Let me double-check.

If the eyepiece's focal length is 6 cm, and the objective is 30 cm, then M = 30/6=5.

Exit pupil diameter D_exit = D_objective / M = 3 cm /5 =0.6 cm.

But the options don't have 0.6 cm. So perhaps my assumption about the eyepiece focal length is wrong.

Wait, perhaps the eyepiece's focal length is not 6 cm. Because the eyepiece is composed of two lenses, each with 6 cm focal length. So maybe the eyepiece's effective focal length is different.

Wait, for a two-lens eyepiece, the effective focal length is approximately f = f1 * f2 / (f1 + f2 + d), where d is the separation between the two lenses. But in a Ramsden eyepiece, the separation d is chosen so that the field lens is placed at a certain position relative to the eye lens.

Wait, I think in a Ramsden eyepiece, the separation between the two lenses is (f1 - f2), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the separation is such that the combined focal length is (f1 * f2) / (f1 + f2). Wait, that's the formula for a lens combination where the lenses are in contact. So if two lenses each of 6 cm are combined without separation (d=0), the combined focal length is 1/(1/6 + 1/6) )= 1/(2/6)= 3 cm. So the eyepiece's effective focal length would be 3 cm.

Wait, that changes things. So if the eyepiece's focal length is 3 cm, then the magnification M = f_obj / f_e = 30 /3 =10.

Then, the exit pupil diameter D_exit = D_obj / M =3 /10=0.3 cm. That's even smaller, but again not matching the options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something here. Wait, maybe the eyepiece's focal length is the sum of the two lenses' focal lengths. So 6 +6=12 cm. Then M=30/12=2.5. D_exit=3/2.5=1.2 cm. Still not matching.

Wait, perhaps the eyepiece's focal length is 6 cm because each lens is 6 cm and they are arranged in a way that their combined focal length is 6 cm. But I'm not sure how that would work.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the eyepiece's focal length as 6 cm, and the magnification is 5x, leading to D_exit=0.6 cm. But that's not in the options.

Wait, but the question is about the diameter of the beam emerging, not necessarily the exit pupil. So maybe I should think about how the beam is focused.

Wait, when the image is at infinity, the rays leaving the eyepiece are parallel. So the beam would have the same diameter as the eyepiece's lens. But without knowing the eyepiece's diameter, perhaps we can relate it to the objective's size.

Wait, another approach: the beam entering the telescope has a diameter equal to the objective's diameter, 3 cm. The eyepiece, with a focal length f_e, will produce an exit beam with diameter D = (f_e / f_obj) * D_objective.

Wait, that would be D = (6 /30) *3 = 0.6 cm. Again, same result, which doesn't match any option.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the telescope formula again. The magnification M is given by f_obj / f_e. So M = 30 /6 =5.

The exit pupil is D_objective / M = 3/5=0.6 cm. But perhaps the actual beam diameter is larger.

Wait, maybe the beam's diameter is determined by the eyepiece's field of view. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the angular size.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think differently. The problem gives the diameter of the objective as 3 cm. The objective's focal length is 30 cm. So the F-number is 30/3=10.

When the image is at infinity, the eyepiece forms an image at infinity, so the light rays leaving the eyepiece are parallel. The diameter of the emerging beam would be determined by the eyepiece's aperture and the magnification.

Alternatively, perhaps the diameter of the beam is the same as the objective's diameter multiplied by the ratio of the eyepiece's focal length to the objective's.

Wait, D_beam = D_objective * (f_e / f_obj) = 3 * (6/30) )= 0.6 cm. Again, same result.

But the options don't have 0.6 cm. So maybe I'm missing a key point here.

Wait, perhaps the eyepiece's focal length isn't 6 cm. Because the eyepiece is made of two lenses, each of 6 cm, perhaps the effective focal length is 4 cm. Wait, where did I get that? Because for a two-lens system in contact, the combined focal length is (f1 * f2)/(f1 +f2)= (6*6)/(6+6)=36/12=3 cm. So then f_e=3 cm.

Then M=30/3=10.

D_exit=3/10=0.3 cm. Still not matching.

Alternatively, perhaps the eyepiece's focal length is 12 cm. So M=30/12=2.5. D_exit=3/2.5=1.2 cm.

Not matching. So perhaps the initial assumptions about the eyepiece's focal length are incorrect.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the eyepiece's focal length is 6 cm, so M=5. Then the diameter of the exit pupil is 3/5=0.6 cm. But the question isn't about the exit pupil, perhaps it's about the actual beam emerging.

Wait, perhaps the diameter of the beam is the same as the diameter of the eyepiece's eye lens. But if the eyepiece's eye lens has a focal length of 6 cm, what's its diameter? Without knowing, maybe it's related to the objective's size.

Alternatively, perhaps the beam's diameter is determined by the focal lengths. The beam leaving the eyepiece is parallel and has a diameter determined by the ratio of the focal lengths.

Wait, maybe the diameter of the beam is (D_objective) * (f_e / f_obj). So 3 * (6/30)=0.6 cm.

Still the same issue.

Wait, looking at the options, none is 0.6 cm. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps the beam diameter is the same as the eyepiece's lens diameter, which is determined by the objective's size and the magnification.
