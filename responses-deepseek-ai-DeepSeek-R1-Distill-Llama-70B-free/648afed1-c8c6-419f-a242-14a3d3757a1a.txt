Okay, so I have this question about androgyny in Bern's research. Hmm, I remember that Sandra Bem did some work on gender roles. Let me try to think this through.

The question is asking what androgyny means according to Bem's research. I think Bem's theory is about gender roles and how people can have traits from both masculine and feminine categories. So, androgyny in her work probably refers to having both types of characteristics.

Looking at the options: 

Option A says it's a psychological disorder. No, I don't think that's right. Androgyny isn't a disorder; it's more about a blend of traits.

Option B is about sociological trends. That's more about society changing, not individual characteristics, so probably not.

Option C says having neither sex's characteristics. Wait, no, androgyny is about having both, not neither. So C is incorrect.

Option D is about fashion. That's a different context, not psychological research.

Option E is a biological term. Yeah, like plants with both reproductive organs, but Bem's work is psychological, so E isn't it.

Option F says having characteristics of both sexes. That sounds right. Bem's androgyny is when someone has both masculine and feminine traits.

Option G is about clothing style again. Not relevant here.

Option H is absence of gender identity. No, androgyny is about a mix, not absence.

Option I describes a gender-neutral personality. Maybe, but I think it's more about having both rather than being neutral.

Option J is genetics, which doesn't fit Bem's psychological focus.

So the correct answer should be F. Bem's androgyny refers to individuals having traits of both sexes.

The correct answer is based on understanding that Sandra Bem's research on androgyny focuses on individuals possessing both masculine and feminine traits. This concept differs from other definitions, such as biological terms or fashion styles, and instead pertains to psychological gender roles.

Answer: F
