The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A teenage male was on trial on charges of illegally entering an owner's property and stealing a car. The witness can only confirm for the prosecution that a car was stolen, the model and type of car, and that it was missing from the property on a certain date. The defense asks witness "isn't it possible that my client did not steal the car, that someone else did it, and that the police are lying about the charges against him? The prosecution objected to the question. Will the court likely sustain the objection?

Options:

A: No, as it is essential for the defense to create reasonable doubt in the minds of the jury.
B: Yes, because the question is not directly related to the charges against the defendant.
C: Yes, because this is an objectionable question based on pure speculation.
D: No, because the defense is merely suggesting a possibility, not stating it as fact.
E: No, because the defense has the right to question every aspect of the prosecution's case.
F: Yes, because it is not permissible to question the credibility of the police without substantial supporting evidence.
G: No, questioning about the possibility of other perpetrators, or about police misconduct, is always permissible.
H: No, because the witness may know something that he is not revealing and for that reason, a cross-examiner is given wide latitude in questioning.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about a legal scenario, and I need to figure out the correct answer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about a trial where a teenage male is charged with illegally entering property and stealing a car. The witness for the prosecution can only confirm that a car was stolen, the model and type, and that it was missing on a certain date. Now, the defense is asking the witness a specific question: "Isn't it possible that my client did not steal the car, that someone else did it, and that the police are lying about the charges against him?" The prosecution objected to this, and the question is whether the court will sustain that objection.

First, I need to understand what's happening here. The defense is trying to create reasonable doubt by suggesting alternative scenarios. In this case, they're suggesting that someone else stole the car and that the police are lying. The prosecution objects, so the court has to decide if the question is allowable.

I remember that in cross-examination, the defense has the right to challenge the prosecution's case. One of the key elements is creating reasonable doubt, which is the defense's burden. So the defense might ask questions that suggest other possibilities to undermine the prosecution's evidence.

But wait, there's a line between suggesting possibilities and making statements that aren't based on evidence. The question here includes two parts: first, that someone else stole the car, and second, that the police are lying about the charges.

I think the first part is okay because it's a common tactic to suggest other potential perpetrators. It's about creating doubt that the defendant was the one who committed the crime. But the second part about the police lying might be problematic. I'm trying to recall if there's a rule about accusing witnesses or the police without a basis. There's something about not being able to impeach a witness's credibility without a proper foundation.

Oh right, in court, you can't just throw out accusations without evidence. So if the defense is suggesting the police are lying, they need some basis for that. If there's no evidence presented that the police are dishonest or that they've lied in this case, then the question might be considered improper because it's speculative.

Looking at the options:

Option A says no because it's essential for the defense to create reasonable doubt. That makes sense because the defense needs to challenge the case, but the question includes an accusation against the police without basis.

Option B says yes because the question isn't directly related to the charges. But the question is about the theft, so it is related. So B might not be the right reason.

Option C says yes because it's based on pure speculation. That rings a bell. The part about the police lying could be speculative if there's no evidence supporting that claim.

Option D says no because the defense is just suggesting a possibility. But courts can limit questions that are speculative or without foundation.

Option E says no because the defense can question every aspect, but that's not entirely true. There are limits on what can be asked, especially regarding speculation.

Option F says yes because you can't question police credibility without evidence. This seems relevant because the question includes an accusation against the police. So if there's no evidence the police are lying, the question is improper.

Option G says no, because it's always permissible to ask about other perpetrators or police misconduct. But I think it's not always permissible; there needs to be a basis.

Option H says no because the witness might know something. But the witness only testified about the car being stolen, not about the police's credibility.

So putting it together, the question includes an accusation against the police without evidence. Therefore, the objection would likely be sustained because the question is based on speculation or lacks foundation. So the correct answer would be either C or F.

Wait, what's the difference between C and F? C says it's based on pure speculation, which applies to both parts of the question. F specifically mentions questioning police credibility without evidence, which is part of the question.

I think the key issue here is the accusation against the police. So the objection would be sustained because the defense is implying police misconduct without evidence. So the answer would be F.

Alternatively, if the question was only about another person stealing the car, it might be acceptable. But adding the police lying makes it improper. So the court would sustain the objection because the question includes an unfounded accusation.

So looking back at the options, F says yes because it's not permissible to question police credibility without evidence. That fits here. So the answer is F.

The question revolves around whether the defense's inquiry is permissible when it suggests both that someone else stole the car and that the police are lying. The defense's right to create reasonable doubt is crucial, but courts require that such questioning must be based on evidence or proper foundation. The issue arises with the second part of the question, which accuses the police of lying without any supporting evidence. This makes the question speculative and impermissible under legal standards. Therefore, the court is likely to sustain the prosecution's objection because it is not permissible to question the credibility of the police without substantial supporting evidence.

The correct answer is:

F: Yes, because it is not permissible to question the credibility of the police without substantial supporting evidence.

Answer: F
