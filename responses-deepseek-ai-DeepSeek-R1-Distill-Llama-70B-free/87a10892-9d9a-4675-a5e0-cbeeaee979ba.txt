Question:

Euglena is a common green flagellate protozoan found in fresh water ponds. Describe briefly the method of locomotion, nutrition, and asexual reproduction in this organism.

Options:

A: Euglena moves by contracting its body, carries on heterotrophic nutrition, and reproduces asexually through fragmentation.
B: Euglena moves by flagellum, carries on autotrophic nutrition and can switch to heterotrophic when necessary, and reproduces asexually through cytokinesis.
C: Euglena moves by pseudopodia, carries on heterotrophic nutrition, and reproduces sexually.
D: Euglena moves by flagellum, carries on autotrophic nutrition but cannot shift to heterotrophic, and reproduces asexually through budding.
E: Euglena moves by flagellum, carries on chemosynthetic nutrition, and reproduces asexually through sporulation.
F: Euglena moves by undulating its flagellum, carries on autotrophic nutrition but can shift to heterotrophic under darkness, and reproduces asexually through longitudinal binary fission.
G: Euglena moves by jet propulsion, carries on autotrophic nutrition, and reproduces asexually through multiple fission.
H: Euglena moves by cilia, carries on autotrophic nutrition but can shift to heterotrophic under light, and reproduces asexually through binary fission.
I: Euglena moves by gliding along surfaces, carries on autotrophic nutrition but can shift to heterotrophic in the absence of light, and reproduces asexually through budding.
J: Euglena moves by flagellum, carries on mixotrophic nutrition, and reproduces asexually through longitudinal binary fission and sporulation.

Okay, so I have this question about Euglena, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let's start by recalling what I know about Euglena.

Euglena is a type of protozoan, right? They're found in freshwater ponds. I remember they're flagellates, which probably means they have a flagellum for movement. So their locomotion method should involve a flagellum. Looking at the options, I can eliminate any that say they move by pseudopodia, cilia, gliding, or body contraction. That leaves options B, D, E, F, J.

Next, nutrition. Euglena has chloroplasts, so they can perform photosynthesis. That's autotrophic nutrition. But wait, I think they can also take in food from their environment when light isn't available, which would make them mixotrophic. So their nutrition isn't strictly autotrophic, but can switch to heterotrophic when necessary. Let's look at the options again. Option B says they can switch to heterotrophic when necessary. Option F says they can shift to heterotrophic under darkness. Option J mentions mixotrophic nutrition, which I think is when they can do both autotrophic and heterotrophic. Hmm, so B, F, J are possibilities.

Now, reproduction. Euglena reproduces asexually, I believe through binary fission. They split into two. Let's see the options. Option B says reproduces through cytokinesis, which is a general term for cell division, which includes binary fission. Option F says longitudinal binary fission, which sounds correct because I think Euglena splits lengthwise. Option J mentions longitudinal binary fission and sporulation. I'm not sure about sporulation in Euglena. I thought they just do binary fission, so maybe J is incorrect there.

So putting it all together: movement by flagellum, nutrition is autotrophic but can switch to heterotrophic, and reproduction via longitudinal binary fission.

Looking at the options:

Option F: moves by undulating the flagellum, autotrophic but can shift under darkness, longitudinal binary fission. That sounds right.

Option B: uses cytokinesis, which includes binary fission, but doesn't specify longitudinal. Also, the nutrition part says can switch when necessary, which is correct. But I'm not sure if B's reproduction is correct.

Wait, I think Euglena's asexual reproduction is specifically by longitudinal binary fission. So option F's description of reproduction is more precise. So F might be the correct choice.

Other options:

Option J says mixotrophic, which I think is correct for nutrition, but the reproduction includes sporulation, which I don't think Euglena does. So J is probably wrong.

So the method of locomotion is by flagellum, nutrition is primarily autotrophic but heterotrophic when needed, and reproduction is asexual through longitudinal binary fission. So the correct answer should be F.

Euglena is a green flagellate protozoan found in freshwater ponds. It moves using a flagellum, specifically by undulating it. Its nutrition is primarily autotrophic due to the presence of chloroplasts, but it can switch to heterotrophic nutrition under conditions like darkness. Asexual reproduction occurs through longitudinal binary fission, where the cell splits lengthwise into two. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option F** correctly describes the locomotion (undulating flagellum), nutrition (autotrophic with the ability to shift to heterotrophic under darkness), and reproduction (longitudinal binary fission). 
- Other options either describe incorrect methods of locomotion, nutrition, or reproduction. For example, **Option J** mentions mixotrophic nutrition and sporulation, but Euglena does not reproduce via sporulation. 

Thus, the most accurate answer is:

**F: Euglena moves by undulating its flagellum, carries on autotrophic nutrition but can shift to heterotrophic under darkness, and reproduces asexually through longitudinal binary fission.**

Answer: F
