Question:

Landowner's property was landlocked. He had to go to court to ask the court to compel the adjacent landowner to give him an easement of necessity for ingress and egress to the highway. The court granted the easement of necessity to Landowner. Over a decade later, another access route to the highway opened up through public improvements. The adjacent landowner sued to stop Landowner from continuing to use his land for ingress and egress. What will the court most likely rule in this case?

Options:

A: The easement is terminated because it cannot exceed five years in length, without being formally renewed by both parties.
B: The easement is terminated because the landowner did not pay for its use.
C: The easement continues because it was granted by the court.
D: The holder of the easement has a right to insist on its uninterrupted continuance.
E: The easement should be modified, not terminated, because the new route may not always be available.
F: The equities favor the termination of the easement where another route is available.
G: The court will most likely rule in favor of the landowner as he has used the easement for over a decade.
H: The easement will continue until the holder of the easement chooses to release it.
I: The easement continues because its purpose of access to the property still exists.

Okay, I'm trying to figure out this easement question. So, from what I understand, an easement is a right to use someone else's land for a specific purpose. In this case, the landowner got an easement of necessity because his property was landlocked, meaning he had no other way to access the highway.

Easements of necessity are usually granted when it's absolutely necessary for the landowner to have access, like when a property is landlocked. They're often implied by law because of the necessity, but sometimes they have to go to court to get them, which is what happened here.

The court granted the easement, so the landowner has been using it for over a decade. Now, a new access route has opened up through public improvements, so the adjacent landowner is suing to stop the original easement use.

I remember that easements can be terminated under certain conditions. One way is if the purpose of the easement no longer exists. Another way is if the easement is abandoned by the holder. Also, sometimes if the circumstances change in a way that makes the easement unnecessary, it might be terminated.

So, the key here is that a new access route is available. The original easement was granted because there was no other way to access the highway. Now that there's another route, does that mean the easement is no longer necessary?

I think the general rule is that if the necessity that created the easement ends, the easement can be terminated. So, if the landowner now has another way to access the highway, the easement might no longer be needed, and thus it could be terminated.

Looking at the options, option I says the easement continues because its purpose still exists. But wait, the purpose was to get access to the highway. Now that there's another access, maybe the purpose is fulfilled without the easement. So I would think that option I is not correct.

Option F says the equities favor termination because another route is available. That makes sense because the adjacent landowner shouldn't be burdened if there's another way for the landowner to access the highway. It's about fairness and balancing the interests.

Option C says the easement continues because it was granted by the court. But courts can change their decisions if circumstances change. So just because it was court-ordered doesn't mean it can't be terminated later.

Option E suggests modifying instead of terminating. But if the new route is a viable alternative, maybe termination is more appropriate.

Option D says the holder can insist on continuing the easement. But I think that's only as long as the easement is still necessary. Once it's not needed, the holder can't just keep it just because they want to.

Option F seems the most plausible. The court would consider that the necessity has ended, so the easement should be terminated because there's another access now available.

The court will most likely rule in favor of terminating the easement because the necessity that originally justified it no longer exists due to the availability of a new access route. 

F: The equities favor the termination of the easement where another route is available.

Answer: F
