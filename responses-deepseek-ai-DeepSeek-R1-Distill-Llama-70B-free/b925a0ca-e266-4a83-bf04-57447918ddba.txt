Okay, so I have this problem here about rounding population numbers. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the population of Louisiana was 4,530,000 when rounded to the nearest 10,000 in 2010. I need to pick which of the given options could be the actual population before rounding.

Hmm, rounding to the nearest 10,000 means that the actual number is somewhere in a range around 4,530,000. Wait, how does rounding work exactly? Oh right, when you round to a certain place, you look at the digit below that place. So for 10,000, we're looking at the hundreds place, I think. Wait, no, the places go units, tens, hundreds, thousands, ten thousands, etc. So the nearest 10,000 would look at the thousands digit. So if the thousands digit is 5 or higher, you round up, otherwise you round down.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Let's break it down. The number we have is 4,530,000. That's four million five hundred thirty thousand. So if we're rounding to the nearest 10,000, the actual number must be in the range that would round to 4,530,000.

So what's the range around 4,530,000 when considering the nearest 10,000? Well, 10,000 is a big step. So the lower bound would be halfway between 4,520,000 and 4,530,000, and the upper bound would be halfway between 4,530,000 and 4,540,000.

Wait, no. Wait, when rounding to the nearest 10,000, the midpoint is 5,000 above and below the base. So the actual number would have to be from 4,525,000 up to but not including 4,535,000. Because 4,525,000 is the lower half (since 4,520,000 + 5,000 is 4,525,000) and 4,535,000 is the upper half (4,530,000 +5,000). So any number from 4,525,000 up to but less than 4,535,000 would round to 4,530,000.

Let me make sure I have this right. So any number starting at 4,525,000 (inclusive) up to 4,535,000 (exclusive) would round to 4,530,000 when rounded to the nearest 10,000.

Now, let's look at the options given:

A: 4,524,491 → Wait, that's 4,524,491 which is less than 4,525,000. So that's below the lower bound. So when rounded, it would go to 4,520,000, right? Because 4,524,491 is only 4,491 above 4,520,000, which is less than 5,000. So option A wouldn't round to 4,530,000.

B: 4,500,321 → That's way below 4,525,000. It's 4,500k, so it would round to 4,500,000. Not the right option.

C: 4,533,372 → Let's see, this is 4,533,372. Comparing to our range: it's above 4,525,000 and below 4,535,000. So that's within the range. So this could be a possible actual population.

D: 4,535,343 → Oh, wait, that's 4,535,343. Which is just above 4,535,000. Oh, but our upper limit is 4,535,000 exclusive. So anything at 4,535,000 and above would round up to 4,540,000. So this number would round to 4,540,000, not 4,530,000. So D is out.

E: 4,537,129 → That's way higher than 4,535,000. So same as D, it would round to 4,540,000. Not the right answer.

F: 4,536,498 → Also above 4,535,000, so same as D and E. Rounds to 4,540k.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. The options are A through F. So the only option within the range is C. So the correct answer should be C.

Wait but let me check the numbers again. Let's calculate the exact value to see where each option falls.

The rounded value is 4,530,000. So the actual value has to be >=4,525,000 and <4,535,000.

Looking at each option:

A: 4,524,491 → 4,524,491 is less than 4,525,000. So that's in the lower bracket, so it would round down to 4,520,000.

B:4,500,321 → way lower, rounds to 4,500,000.

C:4,533,372 → 4,533,372 is between 4,525k and 4,535k. So yes, this would round to 4,530,000.

D:4,535,343 → 4,535,343 is just over 4,535,000 (which is the upper limit). So that would round to 4,540,000.

E and F are even higher, so same as D.

So the correct answer is option C.

To determine which number could be the actual population of Louisiana in 2010, we need to understand the range of values that round to 4,530,000 when rounded to the nearest 10,000. Rounding to the nearest 10,000 means the actual population must fall within the range:

\[
4,525,000 \leq \text{Actual Population} < 4,535,000
\]

This range includes all numbers from 4,525,000 (inclusive) up to, but not including, 4,535,000. Any number within this range would round to 4,530,000.

Now, let's evaluate each option:

- **A: 4,524,491**  
  This is less than 4,525,000, so it would round to 4,520,000, not 4,530,000.  

- **B: 4,500,321**  
  This is far below 4,525,000 and would round to 4,500,000.  

- **C: 4,533,372**  
  This is within the range of 4,525,000 to 4,535,000, so it would round to 4,530,000.  

- **D: 4,535,343**  
  This is greater than or equal to 4,535,000, so it would round to 4,540,000.  

- **E: 4,537,129**  
  This is also greater than or equal to 4,535,000, so it would round to 4,540,000.  

- **F: 4,536,498**  
  This is greater than or equal to 4,535,000, so it would round to 4,540,000.  

The only option that falls within the required range is **C: 4,533,372**. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**C**
