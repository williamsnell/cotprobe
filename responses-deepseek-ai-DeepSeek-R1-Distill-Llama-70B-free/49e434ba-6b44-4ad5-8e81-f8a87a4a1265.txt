Okay, so I've got this economics question here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again. The question says that consumers expect the price of corn to be lower in the near future, and at the same time, the prices of seed corn and fertilizer are falling. I'm supposed to determine what happens to the equilibrium price and quantity.

Hmm, let's break this down. I think I should approach this by considering both the demand and supply sides of the corn market. Right, because equilibrium is where the two curves intersect.

First, the consumers expect corn prices to drop. So, as consumers, if they think corn will be cheaper later, they might buy less now. That would affect the demand for corn. So, the demand curve would shift. If people expect prices to fall, they'll wait to buy, so the current demand decreases. That means the demand curve shifts to the left.

On the other hand, the supply side is affected by the prices of inputs. Seed corn and fertilizer are inputs for corn production. If their prices fall, it becomes cheaper for farmers to produce corn. Lower production costs should encourage farmers to produce more. So, the supply curve shifts to the right because at every price level, they are willing and able to supply more corn.

Now, putting these two together: demand shifts left (decreased demand) and supply shifts right (increased supply). How does that affect equilibrium price and quantity?

I remember that when demand decreases and supply increases, the equilibrium price definitely falls. Because both shifts push the price down. But what about the quantity? The effect on quantity isn't so straightforward. The decrease in demand tends to lower the quantity, while the increase in supply tends to raise it. So the net effect on quantity isn't clear—it could go either way depending on which shift is stronger. But since the question is asking about what's indeterminate, I think the quantity becomes indeterminate because we don't know which effect is bigger.

Wait, but let me think again. The changes in the supply and demand would affect the equilibrium. Since the price is determined by both shifts, but the quantity depends on the magnitude. So, the equilibrium price would fall because both shifts contribute to lowering it. But the quantity could increase or decrease.

So, looking at the options, the equilibrium price will fall, and the equilibrium quantity is indeterminate. Let me check the options:

A: Price rises, quantity indeterminate. No, because both shifts lower price.
B: Price falls, quantity indeterminate. That fits what I thought.
C: Price indeterminate, quantity rises. No, because price is definitely falling.
D: Price indeterminate, quantity falls. Also no.

So the correct answer should be B. But wait, wait. Let me make sure I'm not mixing up cause and effect.

Wait, the consumer's expectation that corn prices will be lower in the future—does that affect demand now? Yes, because if they expect it to be cheaper later, they'll buy less now, shifting demand left. And the input costs affect supply—lower input costs mean more production, shifting supply right.

Yes, so both shifts cause the price to drop. But the quantity could go up or down, depending on the relative shifts. So the quantity is indeterminate, but the price definitely falls.

So option B: The equilibrium price will fall while the equilibrium quantity is indeterminate.

The question involves analyzing the effects of consumer expectations and changes in input prices on the equilibrium price and quantity of corn. Consumers expecting lower corn prices in the future will likely reduce their current demand, shifting the demand curve to the left. Simultaneously, falling prices of seed corn and fertilizer lower production costs, encouraging farmers to produce more, shifting the supply curve to the right.

When demand decreases and supply increases, the equilibrium price will fall because both shifts push the price downward. However, the effect on equilibrium quantity is indeterminate because the decrease in demand tends to lower quantity, while the increase in supply tends to raise it. The net effect on quantity depends on the relative magnitudes of these shifts, which are not specified in the question.

Thus, the equilibrium price will fall, and the equilibrium quantity is indeterminate.

Answer: B
