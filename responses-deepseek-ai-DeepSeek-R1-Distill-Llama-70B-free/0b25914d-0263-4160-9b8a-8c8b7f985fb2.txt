Okay, let's try to work through this problem. So it's about a rotating mirror experiment to measure the speed of light. Hmm, I remember that in these experiments, a beam of light is split into two paths, one going towards a rotating mirror and the other towards a stationary mirror. When the mirror rotates, it changes the angle at which the reflected light returns, and by measuring that, you can calculate the speed of light.

Wait, the setup here is that there's a rotating mirror on Mt. Wilson and a return mirror on Mt. San Antonia, which is 35377 meters away. Oh wait, no, actually, I think the rotating mirror is on Mt. Wilson, and the return mirror is on Mt. San Antonia. So the distance between them is 35377 meters each way. So the total distance the light travels is twice that, right? Because it goes to the mirror and comes back.

So the distance one way is 35377 m. So round trip would be 70754 meters.

Now, the mirror is rotating at a speed of 530 rotations per second. No shift in the light source is obtained. Hmm, what does that mean? Oh, I think when the mirror rotates, the angle of the returning light changes unless the speed is just right. If there's no shift, maybe that means that the light going out and the light coming back are in sync with the mirror's rotation.

Wait, I remember that in these experiments, for each rotation, the mirror's position changes, so the light that's returning has to catch up with the mirror's new position. So the time it takes for the light to make the round trip must be an integer multiple of the time it takes the mirror to make one full rotation. Because if the light comes back exactly when the mirror has completed a rotation, the beam would return to the source without any deflection.

So, let's think about the time. The time for the light to go to the mirror and back is t = (2d)/c, where d is the one-way distance, and c is the speed of light.

The mirror makes one rotation in T = 1/f seconds, where f is the rotational frequency (in Hz, which is rotations per second). So f is 530 rps, so T = 1/530 seconds.

Since there's no shift, the time for the light's round trip must be an integer multiple of T. Let's say it's equal to T times some integer n. But wait, n is probably 1 in this case because if n is higher, the speed would be different. Maybe the first order case is when t = T.

So setting t = T: (2d)/c = T = 1/f.

Solving for c: c = 2d * f.

So plugging in the numbers: d = 35377 m, f=530 Hz.

So 2 * 35377 = 70754. Multiply by 530: 70754 * 530.

Let me calculate that. 70754 * 500 is 35,377,000. 70754 *30 is 2,122,620. So total is 35,377,000 + 2,122,620 = 37,499,620 m/s.

Wait, that's 3.749962 ×10^7 m/s. But wait, that can't be right because the speed of light is about 3e8 m/s. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, 70754 *530. Let's compute it properly.

70754 * 530:

First, 70754 * 500 = 35,377,000.

Then 70754 *30= 2,122,620.

Adding them gives 35,377,000 + 2,122,620 = 37,499,620 m/s.

Wait, that's 3.749962e7 m/s, which is approximately 3.75e7 m/s. But that's way too slow; the speed of light is about 3e8 m/s. So I must have messed up the calculation somewhere.

Wait, maybe I missed a decimal place. Let's see: 35377 meters is 3.5377e4 meters. So 2d is 7.0754e4 meters. Multiply by 530 gives 7.0754e4 * 5.3e2 = 7.0754 *5.3 *1e6 = (approx) 37.5 *1e6 = 3.75e7 m/s. Same result.

Hmm, that can't be right because the speed of light is about 3e8 m/s. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, perhaps the mirror's rotation frequency is in revolutions per second, but each revolution causes the mirror to shift by a certain angle. Wait, maybe each face corresponds to a certain number of rotations.

Wait, the mirror is an 8-faced mirror. Oh! Wait, when a multi-faced mirror rotates, each face reflects the light in a slightly different direction. So perhaps for each rotation, the light hits a different face. So the angle changes with each reflection.

Wait, in the experiment, the light is split into two beams. One goes to the rotating mirror, and the other to a stationary mirror. Upon returning, the beams interfere. When the rotating mirror's speed is such that the path difference causes a shift in the interference pattern.

In the case where there's no shift, it means that the time taken for the light to go to the rotating mirror and back is exactly equal to the time it takes the mirror to rotate by an integer number of faces. So perhaps for each face, the mirror turns 1/8th of a rotation.

Wait, wait, no. Let me think again. The mirror has 8 faces, so each face is at 45 degrees from the next (since 360/8=45). So for each rotation, each face comes into position every 1/8th of a rotation period.

Wait, but actually, when the mirror makes one full rotation (360 degrees), each of the 8 faces takes a turn. So the time between each face being in the same position is T=1/f seconds per full rotation. So each face comes up every T/8 time.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to think about the time that the mirror's surface changes. When the mirror rotates, the angle of the reflected light changes. For the light to return to the same point, the time the light takes to make the round trip must be equal to the time it takes for the mirror to rotate by an angle that would cause the reflection to come back to the source.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model it using the formula that when the light returns, the mirror has rotated by θ degrees, which is equal to 2θ because the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection. So the mirror's surface must have rotated by 2θ during the time the light was away.

Wait, maybe another approach. The basic idea is that when the light hits the rotating mirror, it reflects back. But because the mirror is rotating, the angle at which it reflects changes. So for the light to return to the source, the mirror must have rotated by a certain angle during the time the light was traveling.

Wait, perhaps the formula is c = 2d * f * (n) / (m), where n is the number of rotations and m is the number of faces. Wait, I'm getting a bit confused.

Alternatively, I've read that the formula for the speed of light in such an experiment is c = 2d * f * (n) * (360 degrees), but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula is derived as such: the time taken for light to make the round trip is t = 2d / c. During this time, the mirror rotates through an angle θ = 2π f t radians. For the light to return to the source, the mirror must have rotated by an integer multiple of 2π/n radians, where n is the number of faces. Because each face is a flat, and after each face, the direction would shift.

Wait, so for an 8-faced mirror, each face corresponds to a rotation of 2π/8 = π/4 radians. So the mirror must rotate by an integer multiple of π/4 during the time t. Because if it's any other angle, the light would come back at a different angle, causing a shift.

So, in the case of no shift, the mirror's rotation during time t is exactly k*(2π/8), where k is an integer (like 1,2,3...). So θ = 2π f t = k*(2π/8).

Canceling 2π from both sides: f t = k/(8).

But t is the round trip time, which is 2d/c. So f*(2d/c) = k/8.

Solving for c: c = (2 d f *8)/k.

Since k must be an integer, the smallest k is 1. So c = (16 d f)/k.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's correct. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the correct condition is that the time taken by light to go and return is t = (2d)/c. In that time, the mirror rotates by an angle θ = (angular velocity) * t. Angular velocity ω is 2π f, since f is rotations per second.

So θ = 2π f * (2d/c).

For the light to return without any shift, this angle θ must be an integer multiple of the angle between two adjacent faces. Since it's an 8-faced mirror, each face is at 45 degrees, which is π/4 radians.

So θ = 2π f (2d/c) = m*(2π/8), where m is an integer.

Simplify both sides by dividing by 2π:

f*(2d/c) = m/(8).

So,

2d f / c = m/8

Multiply both sides by c:

2d f = (m c)/8

Then,

c = (16 d f) / m

Now, m is an integer. The smallest possible integer is 1.

So,

c = 16 * d * f.

Wait, but that would give a much higher speed than the actual speed of light. Let me plug in the numbers.

d is 35377 meters, f is 530 Hz.

So,

c = 16 * 35377 m * 530 1/s.

Compute 35377 *530 first.

Let me compute 35,377 * 530.

35,377 * 500 = 17,688,500.

35,377 *30 = 1,061,310.

Adding them: 17,688,500 + 1,061,310 = 18,749,810.

Now multiply by 16:

18,749,810 * 16 = ?

Let me compute that step by step.

18,749,810 * 10 = 187,498,100.

18,749,810 *6= 112,498,860.

Add them: 187,498,100 + 112,498,860 = 299,996,960 m/s.

Wait, that's approximately 3.0e8 m/s, which is exactly the speed of light. But wait, the actual speed is approximately 2.998e8 m/s, so this is about right.

So the calculation gives c ≈ 3.0e8 m/s.

Looking at the options, option B is 3.00 ×10^8 m/sec. So the correct answer should be B.

To calculate the speed of light in the rotating mirror experiment, we use the relationship between the round-trip time of the light and the rotation of the mirror. The key formula is:

\[
c = \frac{16 \cdot d \cdot f}{m}
\]

where:
- \( c \) is the speed of light,
- \( d = 35377 \, \text{m} \) is the one-way distance to the mirror,
- \( f = 530 \, \text{Hz} \) is the rotational frequency of the mirror,
- \( m \) is an integer representing the order of the interference (for no shift, we take \( m = 1 \)).

### Step 1: Calculate \( c \)
Substituting the values:
\[
c = \frac{16 \cdot 35377 \cdot 530}{1}
\]

First, calculate \( 35377 \cdot 530 \):
\[
35377 \cdot 530 = 18,749,810 \, \text{m/s}
\]

Now multiply by 16:
\[
c = 16 \cdot 18,749,810 = 299,996,960 \, \text{m/s}
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
c \approx 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s}
\]

### Step 2: Match with the options
The calculated value of \( c \) matches option **B: \( 3.00 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)**, which is consistent with the known speed of light.
