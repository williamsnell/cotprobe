Okay, so I've got this problem here about the Smart Calculator Corp. and their costs. I'm supposed to find the variable and fixed costs based on the given data. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

Alright, I remember from my economics class that total costs are made up of fixed costs and variable costs. The formula is something like Total Cost (TC) = Fixed Cost (FC) + (Variable Cost per unit × Quantity). So, TC = FC + VC × Q.

The problem gives me two different production levels and their corresponding total costs. The first scenario is producing 700 calculators with total costs of $15,700. The second is producing 1,000 calculators for $16,000. I need to find the variable cost per calculator and the fixed cost.

Wait, I think I can set up two equations here. Let me write them down.

For the first case:
TC1 = FC + VC × Q1
15,700 = FC + VC × 700

For the second case:
TC2 = FC + VC × Q2
16,000 = FC + VC × 1000

Now I have two equations with two unknowns: FC and VC. I can solve this system of equations to find their values.

Hmm, how should I solve this? I think subtracting the first equation from the second might help eliminate FC. Let me try that.

Subtract equation 1 from equation 2:
16,000 - 15,700 = (FC + VC×1000) - (FC + VC×700)
300 = VC × (1000 - 700)
300 = VC × 300

Oh, so solving for VC, I'll divide both sides by 300:
VC = 300 / 300
VC = 1.

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, no, 300 divided by 300 is 1. So the variable cost per calculator is $1. That seems manageable.

Now that I know VC is $1, I can plug it back into one of the equations to find FC. Let's take the first equation:

15,700 = FC + (1 × 700)
15,700 = FC + 700
So FC = 15,700 - 700 = 15,000.

So the fixed cost is $15,000 and the variable cost per calculator is $1. Let me check the second equation to make sure.

Using equation 2:
16,000 = 15,000 + (1 × 1000)
16,000 = 15,000 + 1000 → 16,000 = 16,000. That checks out.

So the variable cost is $1 per calculator and fixed cost is $15,000. Now I need to look at the options to find which one matches.

Looking at the options:

Option B says Variable $1, Fixed $15,000. That matches what I found.

Wait, but let me double-check the other options just to be sure. Option I has variable $2 and fixed $15,000, which isn't what I got. Option J has higher variable costs. Option E has higher VC. So yes, option B is the correct one.
</think>

To determine the variable and fixed costs for the Smart Calculator Corp., we use the total cost formula:

\[
\text{Total Cost (TC)} = \text{Fixed Cost (FC)} + \text{Variable Cost (VC)} \times \text{Quantity (Q)}
\]

The problem provides two scenarios:
1. When \( Q = 700 \), \( \text{TC} = \$15,700 \)
2. When \( Q = 1,000 \), \( \text{TC} = \$16,000 \)

This gives us two equations:
\[
15,700 = FC + VC \times 700 \quad \text{(1)}
\]
\[
16,000 = FC + VC \times 1,000 \quad \text{(2)}
\]

Subtracting equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate \( FC \):
\[
16,000 - 15,700 = (FC + VC \times 1,000) - (FC + VC \times 700)
\]
\[
300 = VC \times (1,000 - 700)
\]
\[
300 = VC \times 300
\]
\[
VC = \frac{300}{300} = 1
\]

Thus, the variable cost per calculator is \( VC = \$1 \).

Substituting \( VC = \$1 \) into equation (1) to find \( FC \):
\[
15,700 = FC + 1 \times 700
\]
\[
FC = 15,700 - 700 = 15,000
\]

The fixed cost is \( FC = \$15,000 \).

To verify, substitute \( VC = \$1 \) and \( FC = \$15,000 \) into equation (2):
\[
16,000 = 15,000 + 1 \times 1,000
\]
\[
16,000 = 16,000
\]

This confirms the solution is correct. Therefore, the variable cost is \( \$1 \) per calculator, and the fixed cost is \( \$15,000 \).

From the options, **Option B** matches these values.
