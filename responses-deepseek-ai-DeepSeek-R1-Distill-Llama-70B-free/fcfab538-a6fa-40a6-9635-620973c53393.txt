Question:

A woman who was three months pregnant enrolled in a pre-natal and post-natal exercise program at the local gymnasium. The contract signed by the woman was to last for one year and called upon the woman to pay $2,000 in quarterly payments of $500. The contract also specified that all fees were non-refundable. Upon signing the contract, the woman made her first payment of $500 and started classes the next day. The woman attended classes on a regular basis for the next three months. At the end of the three-month period, the woman was involved in an automobile accident. Although she was not seriously injured, her doctor advised the woman that she needed complete rest. Her doctor told her to avoid strenuous activity and advised her to discontinue her pre-natal exercise classes. One week later, the woman received a billing notice from the gymnasium, indicating that her second installment payment of $500 was past due. She immediately telephoned the manager of the gymnasium and informed him that she would not be attending any further classes because of her accident. Also, the woman said she did not feel obligated to make any additional payments. Which of the following most accurately describes the woman's duty to pay the gymnasium the second installment fee of $500?

Options:

A: It would not be excused, because the woman did not negotiate a clause in the contract that would allow for cancellation in the event of a health emergency.
B: It would not be excused, because the woman voluntarily entered into the contract knowing that it was non-refundable.
C: It would be excused, because the essential purpose of the contract was frustrated.
D: It would not be excused, because the woman's inability to attend the classes does not affect the gymnasium's ability to provide them.
E: It would be excused, because the accident was an unforeseen event that made it impossible for her to continue the classes.
F: It would be excused, because the woman's health conditions changed due to no fault of her own.
G: It would not be excused, because the contract stipulated that no fees would be refundable.
H: It would be not excused, because her covenant to make the installment payment is also enforceable as a condition precedent.
I: It would be excused, because of impossibility of performance.
J: It would not be excused, as the gymnasium offered services that the woman could no longer use due to personal reasons.

Okay, so I have this question about contract law, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand all the details.

So, there's a woman who is three months pregnant and enrolls in a pre-natal and post-natal exercise program at a gym. The contract is for one year, and she has to pay $2,000 in quarterly payments of $500 each. The contract says all fees are non-refundable. She made the first payment and started classes the next day. She went for three months, then had a car accident. Her doctor told her to rest and stop the classes. A week later, the gym sent a bill for the second $500, and she said she wouldn't pay because she can't attend anymore.

The question is about whether she's obligated to pay the second installment. The options are from A to J. I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, contract law... I remember that contracts can be discharged under certain circumstances. Let me think about the possible doctrines here: impossibility, frustration, impracticability, or maybe breach of contract.

Impossibility of performance is when completing the contract becomes impossible due to unforeseen events. But I think that's more when the subject matter is destroyed or something. Like if you rent a venue and it burns down, making the event impossible.

Frustration of purpose is when the main reason for the contract no longer exists. The purpose was defeated, but the thing can still technically be done. For example, if someone rents a room for a parade, but the parade is canceled. They can still use the room, but the purpose was to watch the parade, so the contract might be discharged.

In this case, the woman can't attend classes because her doctor told her not to. So, the purpose was for her to attend the exercise classes. But the gym can still offer the classes; they're just not useful to her anymore. So, maybe frustration of purpose applies.

Alternatively, is there an implied condition or a failure of consideration? The gym didn't fail to provide the service; it's just that she can't use it. So, failure of consideration might not apply here.

The contract says fees are non-refundable, so the gym is holding her to that. But in contract law, such clauses might not hold up if there's a valid reason for discharge.

Let me look at the options again.

Option C: Excused because the essential purpose was frustrated. That sounds like frustration of purpose. That might be the case here because the main reason she entered the contract was to attend the classes, which she can no longer do.

Option E: Excused because the accident was unforeseen and made it impossible. Wait, but impossibility is more about physical impossibility. She isn't physically unable to pay; she's just unable to attend classes. So maybe E is about impossibility, but that might not fit.

Option I: Excused because of impossibility of performance. No, because she can still pay; it's just that she can't use the service. So impossibility isn't the right doctrine here.

Option D: Not excused because the gym can still offer classes. So, the gym's ability to provide isn't affected. That sounds correct because frustration of purpose doesn't discharge the contract if the service can still be provided. Wait, but I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the traditional rule is that frustration of purpose doesn't discharge the contract unless it's a mutual, principal purpose. The Restatement (Second) of Contracts ยง 6.2 says that a contract may be discharged if the purpose underlying the contract is destroyed, and that was a principal reason for the contract, and the failure is without fault of either party.

In this case, the woman's purpose was to attend the classes, which is the main reason she entered the contract. The gym's purpose was to provide classes for payment. But since the gym can still offer the classes, maybe the frustration isn't mutual. So, perhaps the discharge doesn't apply, and she's still on the hook.

Wait, but the contract is for a service she can no longer use. So, under the UCC, for goods, there's an excuse if the purpose is frustrated. But this is a service contract, which is under common law.

I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think about the options again.

Option C says it's excused because the essential purpose was frustrated. If that's the case, then she doesn't have to pay. But I'm not sure if that's the correct doctrine here.

Option A says it's not excused because she didn't negotiate a cancellation clause. But contract law doesn't require a clause; it's about the legal doctrines.

Option B: She knew it was non-refundable. So, maybe she's bound because she agreed to it. But if a legal excuse applies, the non-refundable clause might not hold.

Option D: Not excused because the gym can still provide the classes. So, the gym isn't affected. That's a point against frustration.

Option F: Excused because her health changed without fault. Maybe this is about impracticability or personal incapacity. But I think personal incapacity (like illness) can sometimes be a reason, but courts are reluctant to apply it unless it's a personal service contract where the individual's performance is key. Here, it's a gym class, which isn't dependent on her personal performance.

Option G: Not excused because the contract says no refunds. But such clauses don't always hold if there's a legal justification.

Option H: Not excused because her payment is a condition. So, the gym can enforce it as a condition. I think installment payments are usually considered, but if there's a discharge, that might change.

Option J: Not excused because the gym offered services she can't use. So, it's her problem. But that seems harsh.

So, what's the correct approach here.

In contract law, the non-refundable fee may be seen as liquidated damages. But if the woman can argue frustration of purpose, she might not have to pay. Alternatively, the gym might argue that they can still provide the service, so she's still liable.

I think the key is whether the frustration of purpose applies. But I'm not sure if that applies here because the gym's ability isn't affected. Therefore, the discharge might not be available, and she might still have to pay.

Alternatively, the non-refundable clause is enforceable, so she has to pay regardless.

Wait, but the contract is for a year, and she's paid one installment. If she can't continue, does the contract allow her to cancel? Or is she in breach?

If the contract is viewed as a service that she can no longer use, but the gym isn't at fault, she might still be liable for the payments because the gym can't be expected to refund.

So, looking back at the options:

Option C suggests excused because of frustration. But I think that's not applicable here because the gym can still perform.

Option D says not excused because the gym can still provide classes. So, she's still on the hook.

Option G says not excused because the contract says no refunds. So, she has to pay.

But contract law sometimes allows exceptions even if the contract says otherwise, especially if the failure isn't her fault.

Wait, but in this case, the contract is for a service that she can no longer use. But the gym isn't refusing to provide the service; she's refusing to take it. So, maybe she's in anticipatory breach, and the gym can enforce the contract.

Alternatively, if she can prove that the purpose was frustrated, she might not have to pay.

I'm a bit torn between options C and D. Let's think about case law. In the case of a service that's no longer needed due to unforeseen circumstances, like health issues, courts might find that the purpose was frustrated. So, she might be excused.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: the contract was for a year, she used it for three months. The payments are quarterly, so she's paid for the first quarter, and the next is due. Since she can't continue, maybe the future payments can be excused.

Wait, but the payments are non-refundable, so perhaps the gym keeps the $500 she already paid, and she doesn't have to pay more. Or does she still owe the rest?

Alternatively, the contract might be considered as entire, not severable. So, she's obligated for the full amount.

But I'm not certain. Let me think about the options again.

Option E: Excused because the accident made it impossible. But impossibility is more about physical impossibility, which isn't the case here. She can't attend, but she can pay.

Option F: Excused because her health changed through no fault. This might relate to impracticability, but generally, personal circumstances don't usually excuse performance unless it's a personal service contract.

So, perhaps Option C is the better choice, frustration of purpose. But I'm not 100% sure.

Alternatively, the fact that she can't attend due to medical reasons might fall under a different doctrine. Maybe it's a supervening impracticability, but that's more for when performance becomes much harder or more expensive, not impossibility.

Wait, in the Restatement, impracticability is when the performance becomes unreasonably difficult or expensive. Here, she can't perform because of her health, but she's the one unable to perform, not the gym. So, perhaps that doesn't apply.

I think I'm going in circles. Let me try to make a decision.

The contract says all fees are non-refundable. So, she can't get her money back. But does that mean she still has to pay the remaining installments?

If she breaches the contract by not paying, the gym can sue her for the money. But if she has a valid defense, like frustration, she might not have to pay.

In the case of pre-natal classes, the purpose is for her to attend. If she can't attend anymore, the purpose is frustrated, so she might be excused from further payments.

So, looking at the options, Option C says it's excused because the essential purpose was frustrated.

Alternatively, Option E says because of an unforeseen event making it impossible. But I think that's more about impossibility, which doesn't apply here.

So, I think the correct answer is C.
</think>

The question revolves around whether the woman is excused from paying the second installment of $500 for a pre-natal and post-natal exercise program after her doctor advised her to discontinue the classes due to a car accident. The contract specifies that all fees are non-refundable, but the woman argues she should not be obligated to pay further due to her inability to attend.

Key considerations include the doctrines of frustration of purpose and impossibility of performance. Frustration of purpose applies when the principal reason for entering the contract is destroyed, making the contract's purpose impossible to fulfill. In this case, the woman's primary purpose was to attend the classes, which she can no longer do. However, the gym can still provide the classes, which weakens the argument for frustration of purpose.

Impossibility of performance typically applies when completion of the contract becomes physically or legally impossible. Here, the woman is not physically unable to pay, so impossibility does not apply. The non-refundable clause in the contract further complicates the issue, as such clauses are generally enforceable unless a valid legal defense, such as frustration of purpose, applies.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option C**: Suggests the woman is excused because the essential purpose of the contract was frustrated. This aligns with the doctrine of frustration of purpose, as the woman's inability to attend classes undermines the main reason she entered the contract.
- **Option D**: Argues she is not excused because the gym can still provide the classes. While this is true, the focus is on the woman's inability to use the service, which could still support frustration of purpose.
- **Option E**: Suggests excusal due to an unforeseen event making performance impossible. However, impossibility of performance is not the correct doctrine here, as the woman can still pay.
- **Option G**: Emphasizes the non-refundable clause, but such clauses may not hold if a valid legal defense applies, such as frustration of purpose.

Given the circumstances, the doctrine of frustration of purpose appears to provide the strongest basis for excusing the woman's obligation to pay the second installment. The non-refundable clause does not necessarily override this defense in cases where the contract's purpose is fundamentally undermined.
