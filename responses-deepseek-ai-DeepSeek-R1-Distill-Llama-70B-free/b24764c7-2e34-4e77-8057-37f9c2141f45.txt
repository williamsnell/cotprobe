Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit new to electric fields and charges. Let me try to work through it step by step. 

The question is about a charged particle that creates an electric field of 2.0 N/C at a point 50 cm away. They want to find the magnitude of the particle's charge, and there are several options to choose from. 

Hmm, right, I remember something about electric fields being related to charges. Oh yeah, Coulomb's Law! Or wait, maybe it's the formula for the electric field due to a point charge. I think the formula is E equals k times q divided by r squared. E is the electric field, k is Coulomb's constant, q is the charge, and r is the distance from the charge.

So the formula should be E = k * |q| / r². So we need to solve for q here. Let me write that down. 

E is given as 2.0 N/C. The distance r is 50 cm, which I should convert to meters because the standard unit is meters. Oh right, 50 cm is 0.5 meters. 

Coulomb's constant k is 8.99e9 N·m²/C², I think. Or sometimes approximated as 9e9 for simplicity. But maybe I should use the exact value for more precision here. 

Plugging the values into the formula: 2.0 = (8.99e9) * q / (0.5)². Wait, let me compute the denominator first. 0.5 squared is 0.25, right? So the equation becomes 2.0 = (8.99e9 * q) / 0.25. 

Wait, actually, no, I think I mixed that up. Because 0.5 squared is 0.25, so in the denominator, it's 0.25. So to solve for q, I can rearrange the formula. 

Starting from E = k q / r², solving for q gives q = E * r² / k. 

So plugging in the numbers: E is 2.0, r is 0.5 m. So r squared is 0.25. 

So q = 2.0 * 0.25 / (8.99e9). Wait, let's compute that step by step. 

2.0 multiplied by 0.25 is 0.5. So 0.5 divided by 8.99e9. 

Hmm, 0.5 / 8.99e9 equals approximately... Let's compute that. 

Wait, 8.99 times 1e9 is 8,990,000,000. So 0.5 divided by 8.99e9 is the same as (0.5 / 8.99) * 1e-9. 

0.5 divided by 8.99... Let me calculate that. 8.99 is approximately 9, so 0.5 /9 is about 0.055555... So 0.0555... multiplied by 1e-9 gives 5.555...e-11 C. 

Wait, but wait, 0.5 divided by 8.99 is a bit more precise. Let me compute that more accurately. 

8.99 goes into 0.5 how many times? Well, 8.99 is almost 9, so 0.5/8.99 is approximately 0.0556, but a bit more. Let me do the exact division. 

0.5 /8.99 = ?

Well, 8.99 * 0.05 is 0.4495. 0.05 is 5e-2. 0.05 *8.99=0.4495. Subtract that from 0.5: 0.5 -0.4495 = 0.0505 left. 

Now, 8.99 * x = 0.0505, where x is the next decimal. Let me compute 0.0505 /8.99. Approximately 0.005617, because 8.99 * 0.0056 is around 0.0503. So adding that, the total is 0.0556 approximately. 

So q is about 0.0556e-9 C. Or 5.56e-11 C. 

Wait, 1e-12 is a picocoulomb (pC). So 5.56e-11 C is 55.6 pC. 

Looking at the options, let's see. Option I is 56 pC, which is very close. Or perhaps I made a miscalculation somewhere. Let me check my steps again. 

Wait, let me redo the calculation more accurately. 

E = 2.0 N/C, r = 0.5 m. So r squared is 0.25 m². 

q = E * r² / k = 2.0 * 0.25 / (8.99e9). 

Calculate numerator: 2 * 0.25 = 0.5. 

So 0.5 / 8.99e9 = (0.5 / 8.99) * 1e-9. 

0.5 /8.99 is approximately 0.0556. So 0.0556e-9 C is 55.6e-12 C, which is 55.6 pC. 

Looking at the options, option I is 56 pC, which is really close. So that's probably the correct answer. 

Wait, but I'm not sure if I used the correct units. Let me double-check. Electric field E is in N/C, which is correct. The distance in meters, correct. Coulomb's constant is in N·m²/C², so everything should unit out correctly. 

Alternatively, maybe I should compute it with more exactness. Let's compute 0.5 /8.99. 

Using a calculator-like approach:

8.99 * 0.0556 = ?

8.99 * 0.05 = 0.4495
8.99 * 0.005 = 0.04495
8.99 * 0.0006=0.005394
Adding 0.4495 +0.04495=0.49445 +0.005394=0.499844. So 8.99 *0.0556= approximately 0.4998, which is just under 0.5. So 0.0556 gives 0.4998, meaning that 0.5/8.99 is approximately 0.0556. 

So 5.56e-11 C is 55.6 pC. So the closest option is I:56 pC. 

But wait, let me check the options again. The options are A:72pC, B:80, C:65, D:100, E:90, F:27, G:45, H:49, I:56, J:38. 

So option I is 56, which is very close. So the correct answer should be I. 

Wait, but wait, I think I made a mistake in the initial formula. Let me think again. The formula E = k q / r², so solving for q: q = E * r² /k. 

Yes, that's correct. So plugging in the numbers correctly. 

Another thing to check: Did I convert 50 cm correctly to 0.5 m? Yes, because 50 cm is half a meter. 

Alternatively, maybe using k as 9e9 for approximation. Let me see what that gives. 

If I use k=9e9, then q = 2.0 * 0.25 / 9e9. 

0.5 /9e9 = (0.5 /9 ) * 1e-9 = approx 0.05555e-9 = 55.55e-12 C =55.55 pC. So that's the same as before, leading to about 55.5 pC, which is 56 pC when rounded. 

So yeah, option I is correct. 

Wait, but wait another thing. Did I mix up electric field direction or something? No, the magnitude is asked, so the direction doesn't matter here. 

So putting it all together, the charge is approximately 56 picocoulombs. So the correct answer is I.

To determine the magnitude of the particle's charge, we use the formula for the electric field due to a point charge:

\[
E = \frac{k \cdot |q|}{r^2}
\]

Rearranging to solve for \( q \):

\[
q = \frac{E \cdot r^2}{k}
\]

### Given:
- \( E = 2.0 \, \mathrm{N/C} \)
- \( r = 50 \, \mathrm{cm} = 0.5 \, \mathrm{m} \)
- \( k = 8.99 \times 10^9 \, \mathrm{N \cdot m^2 / C^2} \)

### Calculation:
1. Compute \( r^2 \):
   \[
   r^2 = (0.5)^2 = 0.25 \, \mathrm{m^2}
   \]

2. Substitute values into the formula for \( q \):
   \[
   q = \frac{2.0 \cdot 0.25}{8.99 \times 10^9}
   \]

3. Compute the numerator:
   \[
   2.0 \cdot 0.25 = 0.5
   \]

4. Divide by \( k \):
   \[
   q = \frac{0.5}{8.99 \times 10^9} \approx 5.56 \times 10^{-11} \, \mathrm{C}
   \]

5. Convert to picocoulombs (\( 1 \, \mathrm{pC} = 10^{-12} \, \mathrm{C} \)):
   \[
   q \approx 55.6 \, \mathrm{pC}
   \]

### Final Answer:
The closest option to \( 55.6 \, \mathrm{pC} \) is **56 pC**, which corresponds to **option I**.
