Question:

Two narrow slits are illuminated with red light of wavelength $694.3 \mathrm{~nm}$ from a laser, producing a set of evenly placed bright bands on a screen located $3.00 \mathrm{~m}$ beyond the slits. If the distance between the bands is $1.50 \mathrm{~cm}$, then what is the distance between the slits?

A: 0.300mm
B: 0.250mm
C: 0.150mm
D: 0.220mm
E: 0.100mm
F: 0.200mm
G: 0.120mm
H: 0.089mm
I: 0.175mm
J:  0.139mm

Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me about the interference of light through two slits. Hmm, I remember that when light passes through two slits, it creates an interference pattern on a screen. The bright bands are called maxima, right?

The problem says the light used is red laser light with a wavelength of 694.3 nm. I think I need to convert that to meters because the other units are in meters and centimeters. So, 694.3 nm is 694.3e-9 meters. Let me note that: λ = 694.3e-9 m.

The screen is 3.00 meters away from the slits. That's the distance 'L' in the formulas I remember. The distance between the bright bands is given as 1.50 cm. Wait, that's the separation between adjacent maxima, so that's the 'delta y' or 'y' in the equations. So delta y is 0.015 meters.

I remember the formula for the distance between maxima in a double-slit interference pattern: delta y = (lambda * L) / d. Here, d is the distance between the two slits, which is what we're trying to find. So I need to rearrange the formula to solve for d.

Rearranging, d = (lambda * L) / delta y. Okay, that makes sense. Let me plug in the numbers. 

Lambda is 694.3e-9 m, L is 3.00 m, and delta y is 0.015 m. So d = (694.3e-9 m * 3.00 m) / 0.015 m.

Wait, let me compute that step by step. Multiply 694.3e-9 by 3 first. 694.3 times 3 is 2082.9, so 2082.9e-9 m². Then divide by 0.015 m. So 2082.9e-9 / 0.015 equals... let me calculate that.

Wait, 2082.9e-9 is 2.0829e-6. Dividing by 0.015 is the same as multiplying by 1/0.015, which is approximately 66.6667. So 2.0829e-6 * 66.6667.

Let me compute 2.0829 * 66.6667. 2 * 66.6667 is about 133.333. 0.0829 * 66.6667 is approximately 5.52. So total is about 138.85. Then multiply by 1e-6 to get 138.85e-6 meters, which is 0.13885 mm.

Wait, looking at the options, option J is 0.139mm. That's really close. So the answer should be J.

But wait, let me double-check my calculation to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me compute 694.3e-9 *3 = 2082.9e-9 m². Then 2082.9e-9 divided by 0.015 equals...

Wait, 2082.9e-9 / 0.015 = (2082.9 / 0.015) * 1e-9. 2082.9 / 0.015 is 2082.9 * (1/0.015) = 2082.9 * 66.666... 

Calculating 2082.9 * 66.666... Let me approximate. 2000 * 66.666 is 133,333. 82.9 * 66.666 is around 82.9 * 66 = 5,471.4 and 82.9 * 0.666 is ~55.24. So total around 5,471 +55 = 5,526. So 133,333 +5,526 is 138,859. So 138,859e-9 meters is 0.000138859 meters, which is 0.138859 mm. So approximately 0.139 mm, which is option J.

I think that's correct. So the answer is J.

To determine the distance between the slits, we use the formula for the distance between adjacent maxima in a double-slit interference pattern:

\[
\Delta y = \frac{\lambda L}{d}
\]

Rearranging to solve for \(d\), the distance between the slits:

\[
d = \frac{\lambda L}{\Delta y}
\]

### Given:
- Wavelength of light: \(\lambda = 694.3 \, \text{nm} = 694.3 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}\)
- Distance to the screen: \(L = 3.00 \, \text{m}\)
- Distance between adjacent maxima: \(\Delta y = 1.50 \, \text{cm} = 0.0150 \, \text{m}\)

### Calculation:
Substitute the values into the formula:

\[
d = \frac{(694.3 \times 10^{-9}) (3.00)}{0.0150}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
(694.3 \times 10^{-9}) \times 3.00 = 2082.9 \times 10^{-9} = 2.0829 \times 10^{-6}
\]

Now divide by \(0.0150\):

\[
d = \frac{2.0829 \times 10^{-6}}{0.0150} = 0.13885 \, \text{mm}
\]

### Final Answer:
The calculated distance between the slits is approximately \(0.139 \, \text{mm}\), which matches option **J**.
