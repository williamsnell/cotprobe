Question:

Two lists, list1 and list2, contain the names of books found in two different collections. A librarian wants to create newList, which will contain the names of all books found in either list, in alphabetical order, with duplicate entries removed.

 For example, if 1istl contains
 ["Macbeth", "Frankenstein", "Jane Eyre"]
 and 1ist2 contains
 ["Frankenstein", "Dracula, "Macbeth", "Hamlet"],
 then newList will contain
 ["Dracula", "Frankenstein", "Hamlet", "Jane Eyre", "Macbeth"].

 The following procedures are available to create newList.
 Procedure
 Explanation
 Sort (list)
 Sorts list in alphabetical order and returns the resulting list.
 Combine (listl, list2)
 Creates a new list consisting of the entries from
 list1 followed by the entries from list2. The resulting list is returned.
 RemoveDuplicates (list)
 Iterates through list. If any two or more entries have the same value, the duplicate entries are removed so that any entry appears at most once. The resulting list is returned.

 Which of the following code segments will correctly create newList?

Options:

A: newList ← Combine (list1, list2)
B: listl ← Sort (listl)
 list2 ← Sort (list2)
 newList ← Combine (listl, list2)
 newList ← RemoveDuplicates (newList)
C: newList ← Combine (listl, list2)
 newList ← Sort (newList)
 newList ← RemoveDup1icates (newList)
D: list1 ← RemoveDuplicates (list1)
E: listl ← RemoveDuplicates (listl)
 list2 ← RemoveDuplicates (list2)
 newList ← Combine (listl, 1ist2)
 newList ← Sort (newList)
F: newList ← Sort (list1)
G: list1 ← Sort (list1)
H: listl ← RemoveDuplicates (listl)
 listl ← Sort (listl)
 list2 ← RemoveDuplicates (list2)
 1ist2 ← Sort (list2)
 newList ← Combine (listl, list2)

Okay, so I've got this problem about creating a new list of books by combining two existing lists. The goal is to have newList contain all the books from both lists, sorted alphabetically, and without any duplicates. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the librarian wants to avoid duplicates. So, the combined list should have each book only once, even if it's present in both list1 and list2. Then, the final list needs to be sorted alphabetically.

Looking at the procedures available: Sort, Combine, and RemoveDuplicates. I need to figure out the right order to apply these.

Let me look at the options one by one.

Option A: Combine list1 and list2. But that's it. So if there are duplicates in either list, they'll be present in the combined list, and the list isn't sorted. So this won't work because it doesn't remove duplicates or sort.

Option B: Sorts both lists individually, then combines them and removes duplicates. Wait, but if you sort each list first, combining them would just put them together in order. Then removing duplicates would handle any overlaps. But after combining, the whole list might not be in order because the two sorted lists could have overlapping elements. For example, if list1 ends with 'Dracula' and list2 starts with 'Frankenstein', combining them would have Dracula followed by Frankenstein, which is correct. But wait, maybe because they're each sorted, the combined list would also be sorted, but I'm not sure. Let's think: if list1 is [A, C, E] and list2 is [B, D], combining gives [A,C,E,B,D]. Then when you sort, it becomes [A,B,C,D,E]. But in option B, after combining, you remove duplicates but don't sort again. So the final newList might not be in order because the combined lists were each sorted but their combination might not be. So this approach might miss the overall sort. So B might not work.

Option C: Combine the two lists first, then sort, then remove duplicates. That makes sense. Because when you combine, you get all elements, but with possible duplicates. Then sorting puts them in order, but duplicates are still there. Then removing duplicates ensures each book is once. Wait, but does the RemoveDuplicates procedure keep the first occurrence and remove the rest, or does it leave any? The example given in the problem has the two lists each with Frankenstein and Macbeth. After combining, those duplicates would be present, and then RemoveDuplicates would leave just one of each. So after combining, sorting, and then removing duplicates, the list should be correct. So option C looks good.

Option D: Only removes duplicates from list1, then doesn't do anything else. So that's not enough. The newList isn't created, so D is wrong.

Option E: Removes duplicates from each list, then combines and sorts. Let's see. For example, if list1 has ["Macbeth", "Frankenstein", "Jane Eyre"], and list2 has ["Frankenstein", "Dracula", "Macbeth", "Hamlet"], removing duplicates from each would still leave each list with unique entries. Then combining would give all unique entries from both, but the order isn't sorted yet. So after combining, you sort, which would arrange everything alphabetically. That should work too. So E seems like a valid option.

Wait, what's the difference between C and E? Let me think. In C, you combine first, which includes all elements, including duplicates, then sort, then remove duplicates. In E, you first remove duplicates in each list, then combine, which has no duplicates, and then sort. Both approaches should end up with the same result, but let's check.

In the example, list1 and list2 each have Frankenstein and Macbeth. So combining without removing duplicates first would have those duplicates, then sorting would have them in order, then removing duplicates would leave one each. In E, each list is first deduped, so combining would have each book once, but the order after combine isn't sorted, so sorting is needed. So E's approach should also work.

Wait, but what about the Combine procedure? The Combine function just appends list2 to list1. So if list1 is ["A", "C"] and list2 is ["B", "D"], Combine gives ["A","C","B","D"]. Then when you sort, it becomes ["A","B","C","D"]. So E's approach would work.

But looking at the options, which one is correct?

Wait, looking back at the options, option E says:

list1 ← RemoveDuplicates(list1)

list2 ← RemoveDuplicates(list2)

newList ← Combine(list1, list2)

newList ← Sort(newList)

Yes, that would work. Because after combining the two deduped lists, you have all unique entries, but their order is list1 followed by list2, which may not be sorted. So sorting newList would arrange them correctly.

So both options C and E seem correct, but wait, let me read the options again.

Option C: Combine first, then sort, then remove duplicates.

In the example, combining list1 and list2 would give ["Macbeth", "Frankenstein", "Jane Eyre", "Frankenstein", "Dracula", "Macbeth", "Hamlet"]. Then sorting would arrange them alphabetically, but the duplicates are still present. So after sorting, you have ["Dracula", "Frankenstein", "Frankenstein", "Hamlet", "Jane Eyre", "Macbeth", "Macbeth"]. Then RemoveDuplicates would make it ["Dracula", "Frankenstein", "Hamlet", "Jane Eyre", "Macbeth"], which is correct.

So option C works.

Option E: After deduping each list, combining gives ["Macbeth", "Frankenstein", "Jane Eyre", "Frankenstein", "Dracula", "Macbeth", "Hamlet"]? Wait no, because after RemoveDuplicates on each list, list1 becomes ["Macbeth", "Frankenstein", "Jane Eyre"], and list2 becomes ["Frankenstein", "Dracula", "Macbeth", "Hamlet"]—no, wait no, because RemoveDuplicates on list2 would remove duplicates within list2. Wait, in the example, list2 is ["Frankenstein", "Dracula, "Macbeth", "Hamlet"], which I think is a typo, but assuming list2 is ["Frankenstein", "Dracula", "Macbeth", "Hamlet"], then it has no duplicates, so RemoveDuplicates does nothing. So when you combine, you get ["Macbeth", "Frankenstein", "Jane Eyre", "Frankenstein", "Dracula", "Macbeth", "Hamlet"]. Wait, no, because after deduping, list1 and list2 are each deduped, so when you combine, the combined list would have all unique entries except for any that are in both lists. For example, if list1 has "Frankenstein" once, and list2 also has "Frankenstein" once, then the combined list would have "Frankenstein" twice. So then you sort the combined list, which would have "Frankenstein" appearing twice in order, but then you don't remove duplicates again. Wait, no. In option E, after combining, you only sort, but you don't remove duplicates again. So the combined list would have duplicates where the same book is present in both list1 and list2. So that would be a problem.

Wait, no. Because in option E, after combining, you sort and don't remove duplicates again. So if the combined list has duplicates from the two lists, like "Frankenstein" once in list1 and once in list2, the combined list will have two "Frankenstein" entries. Then when you sort, they'll be adjacent, but without removing duplicates again, the newList will have duplicates. So option E would not remove those duplicates, leading to an incorrect newList.

Wait, because in option E, after combining, you only sort, but don't remove duplicates. So the duplicates from the two lists would remain. So E's approach would result in duplicates if both lists have the same book. So E is incorrect.

Wait, wait. Let me re-examine option E. The steps are:

1. Remove duplicates from list1.

2. Remove duplicates from list2.

3. Combine list1 and list2 into newList.

4. Sort newList.

So in the example, after step 1 and 2, list1 is ["Macbeth", "Frankenstein", "Jane Eyre"], list2 is ["Frankenstein", "Dracula", "Macbeth", "Hamlet"]. Combining them would give ["Macbeth", "Frankenstein", "Jane Eyre", "Frankenstein", "Dracula", "Macbeth", "Hamlet"]. Then when you sort, it becomes ["Dracula", "Frankenstein", "Frankenstein", "Hamlet", "Jane Eyre", "Macbeth", "Macbeth"]. But since you don't remove duplicates again in E, the newList would have duplicates. So the final newList would have two Frankenstein and two Macbeth entries. But the correct newList should have each book once. So option E doesn't handle the case where the same book is in both lists. So E is incorrect.

Ah, so only option C handles that. Because in option C, you combine first, which includes duplicates from both lists, then sort, then remove duplicates, which removes any duplicates, whether from the same list or across lists.

So the correct approach is to combine first, then sort, then remove duplicates. So option C.
</think>

To create `newList` containing all unique books from `list1` and `list2`, sorted alphabetically, the correct approach involves the following steps:

1. **Combine the two lists**: This ensures all books from both lists are included in `newList`.
2. **Sort the combined list**: This arranges the books in alphabetical order.
3. **Remove duplicates**: This ensures each book appears only once in the final list.

### Analysis of Options:
- **Option A**: Only combines the lists without sorting or removing duplicates. This does not meet the requirements.
- **Option B**: Sorts each list individually, combines them, and removes duplicates. However, sorting the lists individually does not guarantee the combined list is in alphabetical order. This approach is incorrect.
- **Option C**: Combines the lists first, sorts the combined list, and then removes duplicates. This ensures all books are included, sorted, and duplicates are removed. This approach is correct.
- **Option D**: Only removes duplicates from `list1` and does not create `newList`. This is insufficient.
- **Option E**: Removes duplicates from each list individually, combines the lists, and sorts the result. However, duplicates that exist across the two lists (e.g., a book in both `list1` and `list2`) will remain in the final list because duplicates are not removed after combining. This approach is incorrect.
- **Option F**: Tries to sort `list1` directly, which does not create `newList` or address duplicates. This is incorrect.
- **Option G**: Sorts `list1` but does not create `newList` or address duplicates. This is incorrect.
- **Option H**: Removes duplicates and sorts each list individually, then combines them. However, the combined list may not be in alphabetical order, and duplicates across the two lists are not removed. This approach is incorrect.

### Conclusion:
The only correct approach is **Option C**, as it combines the lists, sorts the combined list, and removes duplicates to produce the desired `newList`.
