Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about abdominal masses, and I need to figure out which statement is true. Let's go through each option one by one. 

First, I'll try to remember what I know about abdominal masses and their characteristics. An abdominal mass is a palpable enlargement in the abdomen, and its characteristics can help in diagnosing the cause.

Option A: An indentible mass is caused by fecal loading of the colon. Hmm, I think an indentible mass means you can push into it and it's soft, like it gives way. Fecal loading would make sense here because stool is soft and can be indented. But I'm not 100% sure if that's the only cause. Maybe other soft tissues could do that too, but this might be correct.

Option B: A non-tender mass is always indicative of a benign tumor. Wait, that doesn't sound right. I remember that malignant tumors can sometimes be non-tender too, especially if they're not causing any immediate irritation or obstruction. So B is probably false.

Option C: A hard mass is always a symptom of colorectal cancer. No, that can't be right. There are other causes of hard masses, like other cancers or even some non-cancerous conditions. So C is false.

Option D: An enlarged kidney is dull to percussion. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Percussion over the abdomen... If the kidney is enlarged, like in polycystic kidney disease, the area might feel dull because it's solid. But I'm not certain. I think that solid organs would produce a dull sound, whereas hollow organs with gas would produce a tympanic sound. So D could be correct.

Option E: A movable mass is a definite sign of a hernia. No, a hernia is usually a protrusion and might not always be a mass. Plus, there are other movable masses, like some tumors or cysts. So E is false.

Option F: A large mass arising out of the pelvis which disappears following urethral catheterization is caused by an ovarian cyst. Wait, why would a urethral catheterization affect an ovarian cyst? Oh, maybe because it's related to the bladder. If the mass is actually a distended bladder, catheterizing would relieve it. So the mass disappears after draining urine, which suggests it was a full bladder, not an ovarian cyst. So F is incorrect.

Option G: A mass that changes size is always due to a bladder infection. No, a bladder infection might cause discomfort, but a changing mass could be something else, like a urinary retention where the bladder gets bigger as it fills. Or maybe a cyst that fluctuates. So G is false.

Option H: A mass that disappears after eating is caused by a stomach ulcer. Wait, stomach ulcers are more about pain than a mass. Maybe if the stomach is distended, like with gas, eating could cause it to change. Or perhaps it's a different organ. Not sure about this one. I don't think H is correct.

Option I: A pulsatile mass is always due to an aortic aneurysm. Pulsatile means it's pulsing with the heartbeat. The most common cause is an abdominal aortic aneurysm, but could there be others? Maybe like a pulsatile liver in heart failure, but that's less common. So I might think I is correct, but I'm not certain. Because the question is which is true, maybe I isn't always true, so it's false.

Option J: A painful mass is always a symptom of gallstones. No, gallstones can cause pain, but so can other conditions like appendicitis, kidney stones, or an inflamed mass like an abscess. So J is incorrect.

Re-evaluating the options. Let's go back to A. Fecal loading in the colon would cause a mass that's indentable. So A seems plausible. D was about an enlarged kidney being dull to percussion. I think that's correct because a solid organ would produce a dull sound. So D could be the correct answer.

Wait, what's the actual answer? Let me think again. So the question is which statement is true.

Option D: An enlarged kidney is dull to percussion. Yes, because when you percuss over a solid organ, the sound is dull. So when the kidney is enlarged, it's palpable and would cause dullness. So D is correct.

Alternatively, option A: Fecal loading causing an indentible mass. I'm pretty sure that's correct too. Because a mass of stool is soft and indentable.

Wait, but what's the specific characteristic of a fecal mass? I think fecal loading can cause a mass in the colon, which is usually in the left lower quadrant, and it's soft and indentable. So A is correct.

Hmm, but the options can't have two correct answers. Let me read the options again.

The question is, which is true about an abdominal mass.

Option D: An enlarged kidney is dull to percussion. That's about the percussion note, not the mass's consistency. So D is correct if the kidney being enlarged would make that area dull.

Option A: Indentible mass caused by fecal loading. So if the mass is indentable, that suggests it's soft, which fits with feces. So A is correct.

Which one is true? Because both A and D are possible. Let me think of the answer choices.

Wait, the options are presented as A-J. So the correct answer must be either A or D.

Alternatively, I might have made a mistake. Let me think again.

Dullness to percussion is typically associated with solid organs or fluid-filled structures. A distended bladder is dull, as is an enlarged liver or kidney. So D is correct.

But what about A: Fecal loading causing an indentible mass. That sounds correct too. Because stool is soft and can be indented.

Wait, but another possibility is that a fecal mass is in the colon, which is in the abdomen, so when you press, it's soft. So yes, A is correct.

So now I'm confused between A and D. Let me think if any of these options are textbook facts.

I remember that a common cause of a soft, indentable abdominal mass is fecal impaction, especially in the sigmoid colon. So A is correct.

On the other hand, an enlarged kidney, like in polycystic kidney disease, would have a solid mass that's dull on percussion. So D is correct.

Wait, but the options are about which statement is true. So both A and D could be true, but looking at the options, only one can be correct.

Wait, the question says "which of the following is true", so only one option is correct.

Let me check all the other options again quickly.

B: Non-tender mass is always benign. No, because some malignancies don't cause pain.

C: Hard mass is always colorectal cancer. No, other cancers can present as hard masses.

E: Movable mass is hernia. No, other masses can move.

F: Mass disappears after catheterization is ovarian cyst. No, it's more likely a bladder issue.

G: Changing size is bladder infection. No, more likely related to bladder filling.

H: Disappears after eating is stomach ulcer. Not really, stomach ulcer doesn't typically cause a mass.

I: Pulsatile is aortic aneurysm, which is usually true, but not always.

J: Painful mass is gallstones. No, could be appendicitis.

So, between A and D.

The question is which is true.

So either A or D.

Another approach: look for the fact.

An indentible mass is caused by faecal loading of the colon.

Yes, that's a known fact. Fecal masses are soft and indentable.

An enlarged kidney is dull to percussion. Also correct because solid organs produce dull sounds.

Wait, but in the question, all options are about the abdominal mass. So in option D, the mass is the enlarged kidney. So when you percuss over it, it's dull.

So both A and D are correct statements. But the options only give one correct answer.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again.

Wait, the options are A through J, each with a different statement, only one is correct.

So perhaps I need to pick between A and D.

Which one is more likely to be correct?

In medical textbooks, a fecal mass is a classic example of a soft, indentable abdominal mass. So A is correct.

D is also correct because an enlarged kidney (like in hydronephrosis or polycystic) would be solid and thus dull on percussion.

Wait, but looking for the answer, which is more likely to be presented as correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D because the other options have issues.

Wait, another thought: option F. A large mass arising out of the pelvis which disappears following urethral catheterization. That sounds like a distended bladder. Because when you catheterize, you drain the urine, the mass (bladder) disappears. So F's statement says it's caused by an ovarian cyst. That's incorrect. The correct cause is a distended bladder, not an ovarian cyst. So F is wrong.

So, going back, perhaps D and A are both correct. But in the options given, the correct answer is... perhaps D.

Wait, let me check the options again.

The question is asking which is true about an abdominal mass.

Option D: An enlarged kidney is dull to percussion. That is correct.

Option A: An indentible mass is caused by faecal loading. Also correct.

Hmm.

Wait, but perhaps the question is which statement is true, and maybe only one option is correct.

Wait, perhaps I should think of what each option says.

Option F says a mass that disappears after catheterization is caused by an ovarian cyst. That's wrong, it's a bladder.

So F is wrong.

So which is the correct statement?

I think both A and D are correct statements, but in the options, perhaps only one is present.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D: An enlarged kidney is dull to percussion.

But I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think of which is more likely to be the correct answer.

In the options, I think D is correct because dullness on percussion indicates a solid organ, like an enlarged kidney. So D is true.

Wait, but A is also correct. So perhaps the correct answer is A and D. But the options don't have that.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think about each option's validity.

Option A: Indentible mass caused by fecal loading. True.

Option D: Enlarged kidney is dull to percussion. Also true.

But since the question is multiple choice, only one option is correct.

Wait, perhaps the intended correct answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps I should think about the given options and the usual exam questions.

In exams, I've seen that a soft, indentable mass is often due to fecal impaction. So A is correct.

But D is also a correct fact.

Wait, perhaps the answer is A and D, but since only one can be chosen, perhaps the intended answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in one of the options.

Wait, looking for the answer, I think the intended correct answer is D: An enlarged kidney is dull to percussion.

Because when you percuss over a solid organ like kidney, it's dull. So that's correct.

But A is also correct, but perhaps it's a trick. For example, perhaps a fecal mass in the colon is a mass, but perhaps the cause is more related to constipation. So I'm not sure.

Wait, but the question is about which statement is true. So if both A and D are true, but the options only have one correct, perhaps the answer is D.

But I think the correct answer is D and A. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is D.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is A: An indentible mass is caused by faecal loading of the colon. This is a classic sign.

But I'm getting really stuck. Let me look up my notes.

Upon reviewing, a soft, indentable abdominal mass is often caused by a fecal impaction, especially in the sigmoid colon. So A is correct.

An enlarged kidney, such as in polycystic kidney disease, would present as a solid mass that is dull to percussion. So D is also correct.

Wait, but the options are A-J, and only one can be correct. So perhaps the intended answer is D.

Alternatively, perhaps I should choose the best possible answer.

Wait, looking back, the question is about "true" statements.

So if I have to pick, I think both A and D are correct, but perhaps the intended answer is D.

Wait, I'm not making progress. Let me think about the other options.

Option I: A pulsatile mass is always due to an aortic aneurysm. While a pulsatile mass is suggestive, it's not always an aneurysm. It could be a pulsatile liver in heart failure, but that's less common. So I is not necessarily true.

Option F: The mass disappearing after catheterization is due to a full bladder, not an ovarian cyst. So F is wrong.

So, between A and D, I think both are correct, but in the given options, perhaps only D is correct. Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, the question says "which is true about an abdominal mass." So each option is making a statement about a mass.

Option D: An enlarged kidney is dull to percussion. The kidney being enlarged would be a mass that is dull on percussion. So that's correct.

Option A: An indentible mass is caused by fecal loading. That's also correct.

But in the options, perhaps only one is correct. So I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps the intended correct answer is A. Because the other options have more errors.

Alternatively, perhaps I should pick A as the correct answer.

Alright, I'm going to make a decision. I think the correct answer is A: An indentible mass is caused by faecal loading of the colon.

But wait, I also think D is correct. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D. Because the question is about the percussion note, and that's a classic sign of a solid organ.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D because it's more directly related to the physical examination finding.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is D.

I think I'll have to go with D as the correct answer.
</think>

To determine which statement is true about an abdominal mass, each option was analyzed as follows:

- **Option A**: An indentible mass is caused by fecal loading of the colon. This is correct because fecal loading can result in a soft, indentable mass, particularly in the sigmoid colon.

- **Option B**: A non-tender mass is always indicative of a benign tumor. This is false because malignant tumors can also be non-tender.

- **Option C**: A hard mass is always a symptom of colorectal cancer. This is false because hard masses can be caused by other conditions, such as other cancers or non-cancerous diseases.

- **Option D**: An enlarged kidney is dull to percussion. This is correct because solid organs like an enlarged kidney produce a dull sound on percussion.

- **Option E**: A movable mass is a definite sign of a hernia. This is false because movable masses can also be caused by other conditions, such as cysts or tumors.

- **Option F**: A large mass arising out of the pelvis which disappears following urethral catheterization is caused by an ovarian cyst. This is false because such a mass is more likely due to a distended bladder.

- **Option G**: A mass that changes size is always due to a bladder infection. This is false because a changing mass could also be related to urinary retention or other conditions.

- **Option H**: A mass that disappears after eating is caused by a stomach ulcer. This is false because stomach ulcers typically cause pain rather than a disappearing mass.

- **Option I**: A pulsatile mass is always due to an aortic aneurysm. This is false because, while pulsatile masses are often associated with aortic aneurysms, they can also occur in other conditions, such as a pulsatile liver in heart failure.

- **Option J**: A painful mass is always a symptom of gallstones. This is false because painful masses can be caused by other conditions, such as appendicitis or abscesses.

Both **Option A** and **Option D** are correct statements. However, since only one answer can be selected, **Option D** is chosen as it is more directly related to a specific physical examination finding (dullness to percussion) and is a classic sign of an enlarged kidney.
