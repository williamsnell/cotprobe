Okay, so I've got this physics problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not too confident with gravitational force calculations, especially when it comes to extended objects. But let's take it step by step.

So the question is about a uniformly solid sphere of mass M and radius R that's fixed at a distance h above a thin infinite sheet. The sheet has a mass density rho_s (mass per area). The question is asking, what force does the sphere exert on the sheet? The options are from A to J, each with different expressions involving rho_s, G, M, and sometimes R or h.

Hmm, I remember that Newton's law of gravitation gives the force between two point masses, but here we have a sphere and an infinite sheet, which are not point masses. So I need to think about how to model this situation.

Wait, the sphere is solid and uniform, so maybe I can treat it as a point mass when considering the gravitational field it produces at a distance. But wait, the sheet is thin and infinite, so I should probably model the gravitational field of the sphere at the location of the sheet.

Wait, but the force on the sheet due to the sphere would be the sheet's mass times the gravitational acceleration caused by the sphere at the sheet's location. Oh wait, but the sheet is infinitely thin, so it's like a two-dimensional plane. Also, the sheet is infinite in extent, so we can probably model this using some integration.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The sphere creates a gravitational field, and the sheet is in that field. So each infinitesimal piece of the sheet will feel a force due to the sphere. Since the sheet is infinite, the total force would be the integral over the entire sheet.

But wait, the sphere is at a distance h from the sheet. So the distance from the sphere's center to any point on the sheet is at least h, but points farther away would be at a greater distance. Hmm, but wait, the sheet is infinitely large, so integrating over all the points on the sheet might not be straightforward.

Wait, maybe there's a smarter way. I remember that for an infinite sheet of mass, the gravitational field it produces can be found using Gauss's law, and it turns out to be uniform, right? But here, it's the opposite situation: the sphere is creating a gravitational field that acts on the sheet.

So, the sphere's gravitational field at a distance r is given by Newton's law: the acceleration is G*M / r². But wait, because the sheet is a two-dimensional object, perhaps we model the force per unit area.

Alternatively, think of the sheet as a collection of infinitesimal mass elements. Each tiny mass dm on the sheet will experience a gravitational force from the sphere. So the total force on the sheet is the sum (integral) of all these forces.

Wait, let's model this. The sphere is at a height h above the sheet. Let me imagine the sheet lying on the xy-plane, and the sphere is at (0,0,h). The sheet has a surface mass density rho_s (mass per area). So, for a small area element dA on the sheet, the mass is dm = rho_s * dA.

The force on this mass element due to the sphere would be F = G * (M * dm) / r², where r is the distance between the sphere and the mass element. But since the sheet is infinite, r varies depending on where the mass element is. Wait, but the distance from the sphere to a point on the sheet is sqrt(x² + y² + h²), where x and y are coordinates on the sheet.

So the force on each dm is directed towards the sphere. Since the sphere is directly above the point (0,0,0) on the sheet, the force on a mass element at (x,y,0) will be in the direction of the vector from (x,y,0) to (0,0,h), which is (-x, -y, h). So the force vector would have components in x, y, and z directions.

Wait, but when we integrate over the entire sheet, the x and y components will cancel out due to symmetry. Because for every (x,y), there's a (-x,y), (x,-y), etc., which would lead their forces to cancel in the x and y directions. So the only component that remains is the z-component, which is the direction perpendicular to the sheet (the vertical direction).

So the total force on the sheet is the integral over the entire sheet of the z-component of the gravitational force on each dm.

Let me set up the integral. The z-component of the force on dm is F_z = G*M*dm / r² * (h/r), because the unit vector in the direction from the mass element to the sphere has a z-component of h/r, where r = sqrt(x² + y² + h²).

So F_z = G*M*rho_s dA * h / r^3.

But wait, because the sheet is in the xy-plane, and the sphere is at (0,0,h), the distance r is sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + h^2), as I said. So, the integral becomes:

F = ∫ (G M rho_s h) / (x² + y² + h²)^(3/2) ) * dA

Now, the challenge is to compute this integral over the entire sheet. Since the sheet is infinite, this integral extends to infinity in x and y.

Hmm, how to evaluate this. I think polar coordinates would be easier because of the symmetry. Let me switch to polar coordinates where x = r' cosθ, y = r' sinθ, and r' is the radial distance from the origin on the sheet. So, dA = r' dr' dθ.

Then, the denominator becomes (r'^2 + h^2)^(3/2). So the integral becomes:

F = G M rho_s h ∫∫ [1/(r'^2 + h^2)^(3/2)] r' dr' dθ

The integral over θ is from 0 to 2π, and the integral over r' is from 0 to infinity.

So the θ integral is straightforward: ∫0^{2π} dθ = 2π.

So F = G M rho_s h * 2π ∫0^∞ [ r' / (r'^2 + h^2)^(3/2) ] dr'

Now, let me focus on evaluating the radial integral:

I = ∫0^∞ [ r' / (r'^2 + h^2)^(3/2) ] dr'

Let me make a substitution. Let u = r'^2 + h^2, then du/dr' = 2r', so (du) = 2r' dr', which implies r' dr' = du/2.

Wait, when r' = 0, u = h^2. When r' approaches infinity, u approaches infinity.

So substituting, the integral becomes:

I = ∫_{u = h^2}^{u = ∞} [ 1 / u^(3/2) ] * (du/2)

= (1/2) ∫_{h^2}^∞ u^(-3/2) du

The integral of u^(-3/2) is [ u^(-1/2) ) / (-1/2) ) ] + C = -2 u^(-1/2) + C.

So evaluating from h^2 to ∞:

At ∞, u^(-1/2) is 0. At h^2, it's 1/h.

So I = (1/2) [ 0 - (-2*(1/h)) ) ] = (1/2)(2/h) ) = 1/h.

So the radial integral I = 1/h.

Putting it all back together:

F = G M rho_s h * 2π * (1/h )

Simplify: the h cancels out.

So F = 2 π G M rho_s.

Wait, but let me check the steps again. Did I make any mistake in substitution?

Wait, when I did substitution for I, I set u = r'^2 + h^2. Then du = 2 r' dr', so r' dr' = du/2.

So the integral becomes ∫ [r' dr'] / (u^(3/2)) ) = ∫ (du/2) / (u^(3/2)) )

Which is (1/2) ∫ u^(-3/2) du from u = h^2 to ∞.

Yes, that's correct.

So the integral evaluates to (1/2) [ (-2) u^(-1/2) ] from h^2 to ∞.

At ∞, it's 0. At h^2, it's (-2)(1/h). So:

(1/2) [ 0 - (-2/h) ) ] = (1/2)(2/h) ) = 1/h.

So yes, I is correct.

So then F = G M rho_s h * 2π * (1/h) ) = 2 π G M rho_s.

Looking back at the options:

Option E is 2π rho_s G M.

Yes, that's the expression I got. So the correct answer should be option E.

But wait, let me double-check the setup. The force on the sheet is the integral of the gravitational force on each mass element. Since the sheet is infinite, the integration covers all of space except near the sphere, but wait, no, the sphere's position is at a finite height h above the sheet. So the calculation as done is correct.

Wait, but wait another thing. The force on the sheet is the total force due to the sphere. Alternatively, could there be another approach using Gauss's law for gravity? Because the sheet is infinite, perhaps the field from the sphere at the sheet's location can be considered uniform in some way. But no, the field from a sphere varies with distance, so that approach might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, think of the sheet as a two-dimensional plane, and compute the gravitational force per unit area, then multiply by the area. But since the sheet is infinite, that would give an infinite force unless the force per unit area goes to zero appropriately.

Wait, but the force per unit area on the sheet would be F/A, where F is finite, but A is infinite. Hmm, maybe not the best approach.

But in our initial approach, the integral gave a finite result, 2π G M rho_s, which is option E.

So I think that's correct.

To determine the force with which the sphere attracts the sheet, we analyze the gravitational interaction between the sphere and the infinite sheet. The sphere has mass \( M \), and the sheet has a surface mass density \( \rho_s \). The sphere is located at a height \( h \) above the sheet.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Gravitational Force on a Mass Element**:  
   Each infinitesimal mass element \( dm = \rho_s \, dA \) on the sheet experiences a gravitational force due to the sphere. The force magnitude is given by Newton's law of gravitation:  
   \[
   dF = \frac{G M \, dm}{r^2},
   \]  
   where \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + h^2} \) is the distance between the sphere and the mass element at coordinates \( (x, y, 0) \) on the sheet.

2. **Force Component in the Vertical Direction**:  
   The force on each mass element has components in the \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) directions. Due to symmetry, the \( x \)- and \( y \)-components cancel out over the entire sheet. Only the \( z \)-component (perpendicular to the sheet) contributes to the total force. The \( z \)-component of the force is:  
   \[
   dF_z = \frac{G M \rho_s \, h}{r^3} \, dA.
   \]

3. **Integral Over the Infinite Sheet**:  
   The total force on the sheet is obtained by integrating \( dF_z \) over the entire sheet. Switching to polar coordinates \( (r', \theta) \) on the sheet, where \( r' \) is the radial distance from the projection of the sphere onto the sheet, the distance becomes \( r = \sqrt{r'^2 + h^2} \), and \( dA = r' \, dr' \, d\theta \). The integral is:  
   \[
   F = \int_0^{2\pi} \int_0^\infty \frac{G M \rho_s h}{(r'^2 + h^2)^{3/2}} \, r' \, dr' \, d\theta.
   \]

4. **Evaluating the Integral**:  
   - The angular integral \( \int_0^{2\pi} d\theta = 2\pi \).  
   - The radial integral is:  
     \[
     \int_0^\infty \frac{r'}{(r'^2 + h^2)^{3/2}} \, dr'.
     \]  
     Using the substitution \( u = r'^2 + h^2 \), \( du = 2r' \, dr' \), the radial integral evaluates to \( 1/h \).

   Combining these results, the total force is:  
   \[
   F = G M \rho_s h \cdot 2\pi \cdot \frac{1}{h} = 2\pi G M \rho_s.
   \]

5. **Matching with Options**:  
   The result \( F = 2\pi G M \rho_s \) matches **Option E**.

### Final Answer:
**E**
