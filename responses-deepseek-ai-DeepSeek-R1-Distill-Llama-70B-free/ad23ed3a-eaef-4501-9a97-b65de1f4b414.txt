Okay, so I have this genetics problem here about blood types in a mountain village. Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step. I remember that blood types are determined by the ABO system, which involves three alleles: A, B, and O. The frequencies given are for each allele, right?

The problem states that the frequencies are A = 0.95, B = 0.04, and O = 0.01. Wait, but wait a second, because usually, the sum of allele frequencies should be 1, right? Let me check: 0.95 + 0.04 is 0.99, plus 0.01 makes 1. Oh, okay, that adds up. So that's correct.

The total population is 424 individuals. I'm supposed to find the number of people with each blood type: O, A, B, and AB. I think blood types are determined by the combination of the alleles. So, O is when both alleles are O (OO), A is AA or AO, B is BB or BO, and AB is when you have one A and one B allele.

Wait, but wait, I should think about the Hardy-Weinberg principle here. Oh right, because the population is isolated, it's probably in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, so I can use the p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1 formula. But wait, in this case, we have three alleles, so it's a bit more complicated than the typical two-allele case.

Oh, right. For three alleles (A, B, O), the Hardy-Weinberg equations expand. Let me remember how that works. Each allele's frequency is p for A, q for B, and r for O. So p = 0.95, q = 0.04, r = 0.01.

The possible genotypes and their frequencies would be:

- O O: r^2 → (0.01)^2 = 0.0001
- A O: 2pr → 2*(0.95)*(0.01) = 0.019
- B O: 2qr → 2*(0.04)*(0.01) = 0.0008
- A A: p^2 → (0.95)^2 = 0.9025
- A B: 2pq → 2*(0.95)*(0.04) = 0.076
- B B: q^2 → (0.04)^2 = 0.0016

Wait, but blood types are determined by the phenotypes, not the genotypes. So, blood type O is OO only. Blood type A includes AA and AO. Blood type B includes BB and BO. Blood type AB includes AB only. So, let me calculate the frequencies for each blood type.

So, calculating:

- O blood type: OO → r^2 = 0.0001 → 0.01% → 424 * 0.0001 = 0.0424 → about 0 people. Wait, but 0.0424, which is less than 1. So maybe 0?

Wait, but maybe I should calculate each genotype and then sum them for the blood types.

Let me go through each possible genotype and their frequencies, then sum as necessary.

Calculating each genotype's frequency:

1. OO: r² = (0.01)^2 = 0.0001 → 424 * 0.0001 = 0.0424 → approximately 0 people. But since you can't have a fraction of a person, I'd have to round, but maybe the numbers in the options have it as 0, 1, etc.

2. AO: 2pr = 2*(0.95)(0.01) = 0.019 → 424 * 0.019 = let's compute 424 * 0.019. 424 * 0.02 is 8.48, so subtract 424 * 0.001 (0.424) → 8.48 - 0.424 = 8.056 → so approximately 8 people. But wait, AO contributes to A blood type. So the A blood type includes both AA and AO.

3. AA: p² = 0.95^2 = 0.9025 → 424 * 0.9025 = let's compute that. 400 * 0.9 is 360, 24 * 0.9 is 21.6, so 360+21.6 = 381.6 → but wait, 0.9025 is 0.9 + 0.0025, so 424 * 0.9 is 381.6 and 424 * 0.0025 is 1.06. So total is 381.6 + 1.06 = 382.66 → approximately 383 people.

4. AB: 2pq = 2*(0.95)(0.04) = 0.076 → 424 * 0.076 → let's calculate 400 *0.076 = 30.4, 24*0.076 = approx 1.824 → total 30.4 +1.824 =32.224 → approx 32 people.

5. BB: q² = (0.04)^2 = 0.0016 → 424 * 0.0016 = 0.6784 → approximately 0.6784, so 0 or 1 person. But let's hold that thought.

6. BO: 2qr = 2*(0.04)(0.01) = 0.0008 → 424 * 0.0008 = 0.3392 → about 0 people.

Wait, but adding all these up, let's see:

OO: 0.0424 → 0
AO: ~8.056 → 8
AA: ~382.66 → 383
AB: ~32.224 →32
BB: ~0.6784 →1 (since can't have 0.6 person, perhaps rounded up)
BO: ~0.3392 →0

Wait, but the sum of all these would be:

0 (OO) +8 (AO) +383 (AA) +32 (AB) +1 (BB) +0 (BO) = 424? Let me check: 0+8=8, +383=391, +32=423, +1=424. Oh, yes, that adds up.

Wait, but wait: the blood types are:

- O: only OO → 0 people.
- A: AA and AO → 383 +8 = 391 people.
- B: BB and BO →1 +0 =1 person.
- AB: AB →32 people.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see which option matches this.

Looking at the options:

Option B: O=1, A=391, B=0, AB=32 → Hmm, O is 1, but according to our calculation, O is 0. But maybe I made a mistake in rounding.

Wait, let me recalculate the numbers more precisely, perhaps I missed something.

Let me compute each genotype more accurately.

1. OO: 424 * (0.01)^2 = 424 * 0.0001 = 0.0424 → which is 0 when rounded down. So O blood type is 0.

2. AO: 2pr → 424 * 2*0.95*0.01 = 424 * 0.019 = let's compute 424 * 0.019:

Compute 424 * 0.01 = 4.24 → 424 * 0.009 = ?

Compute 424 * 0.009:

Well, 424 * 9 = 3816 → 424 * 0.009 = 3.816 → so 4.24 +3.816 = 8.056 → AO is 8.056 → 8 people.

3. AA: 424 * 0.95² = 424 * 0.9025 → let's compute 424 * 0.9 = 381.6, 424 *0.0025=1.06 → total 382.66 → 383.

4. AB: 424 * 2pq → 2 *0.95*0.04=0.076 → 424 *0.076 = 32.224 → 32.

5. BB: 424 * 0.04² = 424 * 0.0016 = 0.6784 → 0.6784 → 0.6784 → 0 when rounded down, but sometimes in such cases, it might round up to 1.

6. BO: 424 * 2*0.04*0.01 = 424 * 0.0008 = 0.3392 → 0.

Wait, but if BB is 0.6784, which is 0 when rounded down to the nearest whole number. So B blood type (BB + BO) is 0.6784 (BB) + 0.3392 (BO) = 1.0176, which is approximately 1 person.

But wait, if BB is 0.6784, which is 0 when rounded down, but BO is 0.3392, which is 0 as well. So when summed, B blood type would be 0.6784 + 0.3392 =1.0176 → approximately 1 person. So B blood type is 1 person.

Wait, but when I first calculated the sum of all genotypes, it came to 424, but let me double-check:

OO: 0 → 0

AO:8 →8

AA:383 →383

AB:32 →32

BB:1 →1 (since 0.6784 rounds to 1?)

BO:0 →0

Wait, but 0+8+383+32+1+0 = 424? 8+383 is 391, +32 is 423, +1 is 424. So yes.

So, the blood types are:

O: 0 (from OO)

A: AA (383) + AO (8) = 391

B: BB (1) + BO (0) =1

AB: AB (32) →32.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see any option that exactly matches this. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option B: O=1, A=391, B=0, AB=32 → O is 1, but our calculation says O is 0.

Option C: O=0, A=392, B=1, AB=31 → Hmm, A is 392, but I have 391.

Option G: O=3, A=390, B=10, AB=21 → Not matching.

Option H: O=0, A=391, B=1, AB=32 → Oh wait, that's exactly what I have. Let me check option H.

Option H says:

O=0, A=391, B=1, AB=32. So that matches my calculation exactly. So the correct answer should be option H.

But wait, let me check the given options again. Because sometimes there might be a miscalculation. Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation for the AB blood type. Let me double-check that.

AB is 2pq, where p is 0.95 and q is 0.04. So 2*0.95*0.04 = 0.076. 424 *0.076 = 32.224 → 32 when rounded down.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see option H as having AB=32. Let me look again.

Wait, the options are:

Option H: O = 0, A = 391, B = 1, AB = 32.

Yes, that's what I have.

Looking back at the options given:

Option B: O=1, A=391, B=0, AB=32 → O is 1.

Option H: O=0, A=391, B=1, AB=32 → which matches my calculation.

Wait, but the options provided in the problem are from A to J. Let me make sure I'm looking at the correct options.

Wait, let me list all options again:

Option A: O=2, A=387, B=15, AB=20.

Option B: O=1, A=391, B=0, AB=32.

Option C: O=0, A=392, B=1, AB=31.

Option D: O=7, A=382, B=20, AB=15.

Option E: O=6, A=388, B=18, AB=12.

Option F: O=4, A=380, B=17, AB=23.

Option G: O=3, A=390, B=10, AB=21.

Option H: O=0, A=391, B=1, AB=32.

Option I: O=5, A=385, B=16, AB=18.

Option J: O=0, A=389, B=2, AB=33.

Ah, so Option H is exactly what I calculated. So the correct answer should be H.

Wait, but looking back at the calculation, perhaps I should re-express the blood types correctly.

Wait, another way to approach this is to calculate the phenotype frequencies directly.

Phenotype O is OO only: r² → 0.01² = 0.0001 → 424 *0.0001 → 0.0424 → 0.

Phenotype A is AA + AO → p² + 2pr → (0.95)^2 + 2*0.95*0.01 → 0.9025 + 0.019 = 0.9215 → 424 *0.9215 → let me compute 424 *0.9 = 381.6, 424 *0.0215 = approx 9.106 → total 381.6 +9.106 = 390.706 → approx 391. So, 391 people. That matches.

Phenotype B is BB + BO → q² + 2qr → (0.04)^2 + 2*(0.04)(0.01) → 0.0016 + 0.0008 = 0.0024 → 424 *0.0024 = 1.0176 → approx 1 person.

Phenotype AB is 2pq → 2*(0.95)(0.04) =0.076 → 424 *0.076 = 32.224 → 32 people.

So that all adds up correctly. Thus, the correct option is H.

To solve the problem, we use the Hardy-Weinberg principle to calculate the number of individuals with each blood type (O, A, B, AB) in the population. The allele frequencies are given as \( p = 0.95 \) (A), \( q = 0.04 \) (B), and \( r = 0.01 \) (O). The total population is 424 individuals.

### Step 1: Calculate genotype frequencies
Using the Hardy-Weinberg equations for three alleles, the genotype frequencies are:

1. **OO (O blood type):** \( r^2 = (0.01)^2 = 0.0001 \)  
   Number of individuals: \( 424 \times 0.0001 = 0.0424 \), rounded to **0**.

2. **AO (A blood type):** \( 2pr = 2 \times 0.95 \times 0.01 = 0.019 \)  
   Number of individuals: \( 424 \times 0.019 = 8.056 \), rounded to **8**.

3. **AA (A blood type):** \( p^2 = (0.95)^2 = 0.9025 \)  
   Number of individuals: \( 424 \times 0.9025 = 382.66 \), rounded to **383**.

4. **AB (AB blood type):** \( 2pq = 2 \times 0.95 \times 0.04 = 0.076 \)  
   Number of individuals: \( 424 \times 0.076 = 32.224 \), rounded to **32**.

5. **BB (B blood type):** \( q^2 = (0.04)^2 = 0.0016 \)  
   Number of individuals: \( 424 \times 0.0016 = 0.6784 \), rounded to **1**.

6. **BO (B blood type):** \( 2qr = 2 \times 0.04 \times 0.01 = 0.0008 \)  
   Number of individuals: \( 424 \times 0.0008 = 0.3392 \), rounded to **0**.

### Step 2: Sum genotype frequencies for each blood type
- **O blood type:** OO only = \( 0 \).
- **A blood type:** AA + AO = \( 383 + 8 = 391 \).
- **B blood type:** BB + BO = \( 1 + 0 = 1 \).
- **AB blood type:** AB only = \( 32 \).

### Step 3: Verify the total
The total number of individuals is \( 0 + 391 + 1 + 32 = 424 \), which matches the given population size.

### Step 4: Match with the options
From the calculations:
- O = 0, A = 391, B = 1, AB = 32.

This matches **Option H**.

Answer: H
