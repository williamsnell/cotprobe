Okay, I'm trying to solve this math problem, but I'm a bit confused. Let me read it again and think through it step by step.

So, Grady rides his bike 60% faster than his little brother Noah. That means Grady's speed is more than Noah's. I think if Noah's speed is, say, N miles per hour, then Grady's speed would be N plus 60% of N. Wait, 60% faster than Noah, so that's N + 0.6N, which equals 1.6N. Yeah, that sounds right.

The problem says that Grady rides 12 miles further than Noah in two hours. Hmm, so in two hours, the distance each covers depends on their speeds. Distance is speed multiplied by time, right? So for Noah, distance would be N * 2, and for Grady, it's 1.6N * 2.

The difference in their distances is 12 miles. So Grady's distance minus Noah's distance equals 12. Let me write that out:

1.6N * 2 - N * 2 = 12

Let me compute that. Let's factor out the 2:

2*(1.6N - N) = 12

What's 1.6N minus N? That should be 0.6N. So:

2*(0.6N) = 12

Which simplifies to 1.2N = 12.

Wait, if 1.2N equals 12, then N would be 12 divided by 1.2. Let me calculate that. 12 divided by 1.2. Hmm, 1.2 times 10 is 12, right? So 12 / 1.2 = 10. So N is 10 mph.

Let me double-check. If Noah rides at 10 mph, then Grady rides at 1.6 *10 = 16 mph. In two hours, Noah goes 20 miles, and Grady goes 32 miles. The difference is 32 -20 = 12 miles. Yep, that matches the problem statement.

So the answer should be 10 mph, which is option I.

To solve the problem, let's denote Noah's speed as \( N \) miles per hour. Since Grady rides 60% faster than Noah, Grady's speed is \( 1.6N \) miles per hour. 

The distance each person travels in two hours is given by their speed multiplied by time. Therefore, Noah travels \( 2N \) miles, and Grady travels \( 2 \times 1.6N = 3.2N \) miles. The problem states that Grady rides 12 miles further than Noah in this time, so we can write the equation:

\[
3.2N - 2N = 12
\]

Simplifying:

\[
1.2N = 12
\]

Solving for \( N \):

\[
N = \frac{12}{1.2} = 10
\]

Thus, Noah rides at a speed of 10 miles per hour. Verifying, if Noah's speed is 10 mph, Grady's speed is \( 1.6 \times 10 = 16 \) mph. In two hours, Noah travels \( 2 \times 10 = 20 \) miles, and Grady travels \( 2 \times 16 = 32 \) miles. The difference is \( 32 - 20 = 12 \) miles, which matches the problem statement.

The correct answer is **I: 10**.
