Okay, so I need to tackle this logic problem. Let me start by understanding what's being asked. The question is about constructing a truth table for a given argument and then determining if the argument is valid or not. If it's invalid, I have to find a counterexample from the options provided.

The argument given is:
Q ≡ R
~(S ∨ Q) / R

Wait, I'm not exactly sure about the notation here. Let me parse it. The first line is Q if and only if R, which is written as Q ≡ R. The second line seems to be a conclusion, but the way it's written is a bit confusing. Oh, I think the argument is presented in a way where the premises are given, and the conclusion is derived. So the structure is:

Premise 1: Q ≡ R
Premise 2: ~(S ∨ Q)
Conclusion: R

So the argument is: If Q is equivalent to R, and it's not the case that S or Q is true, then R must be true. I need to determine whether this argument is valid.

To do this, I'll construct a truth table for all the propositions involved: Q, S, R. Then, I'll compute the truth values for each premise and the conclusion, and see if there's any row where the premises are true, but the conclusion is false. If such a row exists, the argument is invalid, and that row provides a counterexample.

Let's outline the steps:

1. Determine all possible truth values for Q, S, R.
2. For each combination, compute the truth value of Premise 1 (Q ≡ R).
3. Compute the truth value of Premise 2 (~(S ∨ Q)).
4. Compute the truth value of the conclusion (R).
5. Check each row where both premises are true. If in any such row the conclusion is false, the argument is invalid, and that row is a counterexample.

Now, since there are three variables, Q, S, R, there are 2^3 = 8 possible combinations.

Let me list them:

1. Q=T, S=T, R=T
2. Q=T, S=T, R=F
3. Q=T, S=F, R=T
4. Q=T, S=F, R=F
5. Q=F, S=T, R=T
6. Q=F, S=T, R=F
7. Q=F, S=F, R=T
8. Q=F, S=F, R=F

Now, for each row, compute the premises and conclusion.

Starting with row 1:
Q=T, S=T, R=T
Premise 1: Q≡R = T≡T = T
Premise 2: ~(S∨Q) = ~(T∨T) = ~T = F
Conclusion: R = T
So both premises: T and F → overall premises are F (since both need to be true for the argument to hold). So this row is not a case where premises are true.

Row 2:
Q=T, S=T, R=F
Premise1: T≡F=F
Premise2: ~(T∨T)=~T=F
Conclusion: F
Premises are F and F, so no.

Row3:
Q=T, S=F, R=T
Prem1: T≡T=T
Prem2: ~(F∨T)=~T=F
Conclusion: T
Premises: T and F → F. Not a case.

Row4:
Q=T, S=F, R=F
Prem1: T≡F=F
Prem2: ~(F∨T)=~T=F
Conclusion:F
Premises: F and F → F.

Row5:
Q=F, S=T, R=T
Prem1: F≡T=F
Prem2: ~(T∨F)=~T=F
Conclusion: T
Premises: F and F → F.

Row6:
Q=F, S=T, R=F
Prem1: F≡F=T
Prem2: ~(T∨F)=~T=F
Conclusion: F
So premises: T (Prem1) and F (Prem2) → overall F.

Row7:
Q=F, S=F, R=T
Prem1: F≡T=F
Prem2: ~(F∨F)=~F=T
Conclusion: T
So Prem1 is F, Prem2 is T. So premises are F and T → F. Not a case where both premises are true.

Row8:
Q=F, S=F, R=F
Prem1: F≡F=T
Prem2: ~(F∨F)=~F=T
Conclusion: F
So here, both premises are T. But the conclusion is F. So this is a case where both premises are true, but the conclusion is false. Therefore, the argument is invalid, and this row is a counterexample.

Wait, that's row 8. Let me double-check my calculations for row8.

Q=F, S=F, R=F.

Premise1: Q ≡ R → F ≡ F → T.

Premise2: ~(S ∨ Q) → S=F, Q=F → S∨Q=F. So ~F=T.

Conclusion: R is F.

So yes, premises are both true, conclusion is false. So this is a counterexample.

Now, looking at the options, which option presents this situation as a counterexample.

Looking back at the options:

Option A: Invalid. Counterexample when Q, S, and R are false.

Yes, that's exactly row 8. So option A is a correct counterexample.

Wait, but let me make sure there's no other counterexamples. Are there any other rows where both premises are true, and conclusion is false?

Looking through the rows:

Row8 is the only one where both premises are true, and conclusion is false. So that's the only counterexample.

So the argument is invalid, and the counterexample is when Q, S, R are all false, which is option A.
</think>

To determine the validity of the argument, we construct a truth table for the propositions Q, S, and R. The argument is as follows:

1. **Premise 1**: \( Q \equiv R \)
2. **Premise 2**: \( \neg (S \lor Q) \)
3. **Conclusion**: \( R \)

We evaluate the truth values of the premises and the conclusion for all possible combinations of Q, S, and R. There are \( 2^3 = 8 \) possible combinations:

| Q | S | R | \( Q \equiv R \) | \( \neg (S \lor Q) \) | Conclusion (R) | Premises True? | Conclusion True? |
|---|---|---|----------------|-----------------------|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| T | T | T | T              | F                     | T              | F             | T              |
| T | T | F | F              | F                     | F              | F             | F              |
| T | F | T | T              | F                     | T              | F             | T              |
| T | F | F | F              | F                     | F              | F             | F              |
| F | T | T | F              | F                     | T              | F             | T              |
| F | T | F | T              | F                     | F              | F             | F              |
| F | F | T | F              | T                     | T              | F             | T              |
| F | F | F | T              | T                     | F              | T             | F              |

### Analysis:
- The argument is valid if, in every row where both premises are true, the conclusion is also true.
- From the table, the only row where both premises are true is row 8: \( Q = F, S = F, R = F \). However, in this row, the conclusion \( R = F \) is false.
- Since there exists at least one row where the premises are true but the conclusion is false, the argument is **invalid**.
- The counterexample is when \( Q = F, S = F, R = F \), which corresponds to **Option A**.
