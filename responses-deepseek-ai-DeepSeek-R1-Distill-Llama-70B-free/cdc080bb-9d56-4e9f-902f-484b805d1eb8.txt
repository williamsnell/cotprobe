Okay, so I've got this question about orbital resonance and which of the options are not caused by it. Hmm. Let me think about what I remember from my astronomy class.

Orbital resonance, if I'm not mistaken, is when two objects orbiting the same body have periods that are in a ratio of small integers. Like 2:1 or 3:2. This can lead to gravitational interactions that affect their orbits. So, things like gaps in planetary rings or the distribution of asteroids can be influenced by this.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Gaps in Saturn's rings. I remember that Saturn's rings have gaps, some of which are caused by moons. The Cassini Division is one of them. But I think some gaps are due to orbital resonance. Like maybe the Mimas and Enceladus resonances create gaps. So A might be caused by resonance.

Option B: Kirkwood Gaps. I've heard that these are regions in the asteroid belt where there are fewer asteroids. They are at specific distances from the Sun where orbital periods would be in resonance with Jupiter's period, like 3:1 or 2:1. So these gaps are definitely due to orbital resonance. So B is caused by it.

Option C: The Cassini Division. That's a big gap in Saturn's rings. I think this is caused by the moon Mimas. The resonance here is 2:1 between the moon's orbit and the ring particles. So particles at that distance would be tugged by Mimas, creating the gap. So C is caused by resonance.

Option D: 2:3 ratio of Neptune and Pluto. Wait, isn't that the other way around? I thought Pluto has a 3:2 resonance with Neptune. So their orbital periods are in a 3:2 ratio. This resonance helps stabilize Pluto's orbit, keeping it in a safe distance from Neptune. So D is definitely due to orbital resonance.

Option E: Breaking of small Jovian moons to form ring materials. Hmm, I'm not so sure about this. I know that some moons can break apart if they're too close to the planet and get tidally disrupted. But is that because of orbital resonance? Or is it more about tidal forces? I think resonance affects the stability of orbits, leading to moons being ejected or perhaps colliding, but the actual breaking apart due to tidal forces might not be directly caused by orbital resonance. So E might not be caused by resonance.

Wait, but maybe orbital resonance can lead to moons being in certain orbits where they experience more perturbations, making them more likely to break apart. Alternatively, the rings themselves are formed from moons that were destroyed, perhaps because their orbits became unstable due to resonance. Or maybe E is more about tidal forces causing the moons to break up. I'm a bit fuzzy on this point.

So from what I remember, orbital resonance explains the gaps in rings (A and C), Kirkwood gaps (B), and Pluto's orbit (D). The breaking of moons into rings is probably more about tidal disruption or collisions rather than orbital resonance. So E is not caused by orbital resonance.

Orbital resonance occurs when two orbiting objects have periods in a ratio of small integers, leading to gravitational interactions that can shape their orbits and surrounding structures. Letâ€™s analyze the options:

- **A: Gaps in Saturn's rings** - These gaps are often caused by orbital resonance with Saturn's moons. For example, the Mimas-Enceladus resonance contributes to certain gaps. Thus, this is caused by orbital resonance.

- **B: Kirkwood Gaps** - These are regions in the asteroid belt where fewer asteroids are found. They occur at distances where orbital periods are in resonance with Jupiter's, such as 3:1 or 2:1. This is a clear result of orbital resonance.

- **C: The Cassini Division** - This prominent gap in Saturn's rings is caused by the 2:1 orbital resonance with the moon Mimas. Particles in this region are perturbed by Mimas, creating the gap. Therefore, this is caused by orbital resonance.

- **D: 2:3 periodic ratio of Neptune:Pluto** - Pluto's orbit is stabilized by a 3:2 orbital resonance with Neptune, meaning for every two orbits Pluto makes, Neptune completes three. This is a classic example of orbital resonance.

- **E: Breaking of small Jovian moons to form ring materials** - The destruction of moons to form ring material is primarily due to tidal forces or collisions, not orbital resonance. While resonance can destabilize orbits, the actual breaking apart of moons is not directly caused by it.

Based on this analysis, the option that is NOT caused by orbital resonance is **E**.

Answer: E
