Okay, so I'm trying to solve this accounting problem about profit sharing between two partners, A1 and Bob. Let me read the question again carefully.

A1 invested $70,000 and Bob $90,000. The profits and losses are shared in a way where each partner gets 8% interest on their investment and then half of the remaining balance. The business made a $10,000 profit. I need to find out each partner's share from the options given.

Hmm, I think I should break this down step by step. First, calculate each partner's 8% interest on their investment. Then, the remaining profit is split equally between them.

So, starting with A1's 8% interest. 8% of $70,000. Let's calculate that. 70,000 times 0.08 is... 70,000 * 0.08 = $5,600. Okay, so A1 gets $5,600 as interest.

Bob's investment is $90,000, so 8% of that is 90,000 * 0.08 = $7,200. So Bob gets $7,200 as interest.

Now, adding these together, that's $5,600 + $7,200 = $12,800. But wait, the total profit is only $10,000. That can't be right because the interest alone exceeds the profit. That can't happen because if the profit is only $10k, you can't pay more than that in interest.

Wait, maybe I misunderstood the profit-sharing arrangement. Let me read the question again. It says each partner receives 8% interest on their investment and 1/2 of the balance. Oh, so the 8% is taken first, and then the remaining profit is split equally. But wait, let me make sure.

Another interpretation: The total profit is $10,000. First, each partner gets 8% on their investment, but only from the profit. Wait, no, that can't be because the interest is a return on their investment, which is separate from the profit.

Wait, perhaps the 8% is calculated on their investment before any profit is considered. But the total profit is $10,000. So the total interest is 8% of their investments, which may or may not come out of the profit.

Wait, but if the total interest is more than the profit, that's a problem. Let me compute the total interest first.

A1: $70,000 * 8% = $5,600.

Bob: $90,000 * 8% = $7,200.

So total interest is $5,600 + $7,200 = $12,800.

But the total profit is only $10,000, which is less than $12,800. That doesn't make sense because you can't distribute more than the profit exists. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the profit-sharing arrangement.

Wait another thought: Maybe the 8% is applied to the profit, not the investment. But that doesn't make much sense because 8% interest on investment would logically be based on their capital.

Alternatively, perhaps the profit is distributed as follows: each partner gets their 8% interest, and then any remaining profit is split 50-50.

So let's try that. Total profit is $10,000.

First, calculate the total interest: A1's 8% is $5,600, Bob's is $7,200, totaling $12,800. But since the profit is only $10k, there's a problem here. Because $12,800 is more than $10k, so they can't pay that much in interest.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the 8% is a minimum, and the remaining profit is split. Or perhaps the 8% is applied to the profit, but that seems less likely.

Wait, perhaps the profit is distributed by first giving each partner 8% on their investment, and then the remaining profit is split equally between them.

But the total interest is $12,800, which is more than $10k, so that can't be. So maybe only the profit is distributed as: each gets 8% on their investment from the profit, but that's impossible because 8% of their investments is more than the profit.

Wait, perhaps the profit is $10,000, and the partners are entitled to 8% interest on their investment, but that comes out of the profit. So perhaps the profit is split into two parts: 8% on their investments, and then the remainder split equally.

But the total interest needed is $12,800, which is more than the $10k profit. That would mean a loss, but the question states that the business earned a $10k profit, so that's not possible. So maybe I've misinterpreted the sharing arrangement.

Wait, perhaps the profit is first allocated to pay each partner 8% on their investment, and if there's any profit left after that, it's split equally. But in this case, the 8% total would be $12,800, which is more than the $10k profit. So that can't happen because you can't pay more than the profit available.

So perhaps the 8% is applied to each partner's share of the profit, not their investment. Wait, that might make more sense. Let me think again.

Alternative approach: The profit is $10,000. The partners split this profit such that each gets 8% of the profit as their share, plus half of the remaining profit. No, that doesn't make sense because 8% of the profit would be small.

Wait, perhaps the 8% is on their respective investments, but only up to the amount of profit. So for A1, the interest is 8% of $70k, which is $5,600. But since the total profit is $10k, we can't give more than that. So perhaps A1 gets $5,600 and Bob gets $4,400 (because 5,600 +4,400 =10k). But that's assuming that the interest is paid proportionally. Alternatively, maybe Bob only gets 8% on his investment, up to the remaining profit after A1 takes his share.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is:

Total profit = $10,000.

Each partner gets 8% on their investment, but since the total of 8% exceeds the profit, each gets a proportion of their interest based on the profit.

Wait, let's try this.

Total 8% interest = $5,600 (A1) + $7,200 (Bob) = $12,800.

But profit is $10,000, so the ratio of profit to total interest is 10,000 / 12,800 = approx 0.78125 or 25/32.

So each partner gets their 8% interest multiplied by (10,000 / 12,800).

So A1's share would be 5,600 * (10,000 /12,800) = 5,600 * (25/32) = let's compute that.

25/32 = 0.78125.

5,600 * 0.78125 = 4,375.

And Bob's share would be 7,200 * 0.78125 = 5,625.

Wait, but 4,375 +5,625 =10,000, which works. So each partner's interest is scaled down proportionally because the total interest exceeds the profit.

But then, after that, the question mentions that each partner receives 8% interest and half of the balance. Wait, maybe I'm not considering the second part correctly.

Wait, perhaps the profit is allocated as follows: first, each partner gets 8% on their investment. Then, any remaining profit is split equally (50-50) between them.

But in this case, the total interest is 12,800, which is more than the profit. So perhaps the interest cannot be fully paid, so they only get a portion of their 8% interest, and then split the remaining profit.

Wait, but that's getting complicated. Let me think again.

Alternative approach:

Profit = $10,000.

Each partner is to receive:

- 8% on their investment.

- Plus half of the remaining profit after the 8% is allocated.

Wait, but let me compute it step by step.

First, calculate 8% for each partner.

A1: 70,000 *8% =5,600.

Bob:90,000 *8% =7,200.

Total interest needed:12,800.

But profit is only 10,000, so they can't pay the full 8% to both. So perhaps the 8% is adjusted.

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to compute each partner's share as 8% of their investment, but if the total exceeds the profit, then each gets their proportion.

But the question says "each partner receives 8% interest on his investment and 1/2 of the balance." So maybe it's that each gets 8% of their investment, and then the rest is split 50/50.

Wait, but 8% of their investment is more than the total profit, so that's impossible. So perhaps the 8% is applied to the profit.

Wait, perhaps the 8% is on the profit, not the investment. Let me try that.

Total profit is $10,000.

Each partner gets 8% of the profit as their interest, and then the remaining is split equally.

Wait, 8% of the profit is $800 each. So A1 and Bob each get $800 from the profit as interest. Then, the remaining profit is $10,000 - (800+800)= $8,400. They split this equally, so each gets $4,200.

So A1's total share: 800 +4,200=5,000.

Bob's:800 +4,200=5,000.

But looking at the options, none of them have both at 5k. So perhaps that's not the right approach.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try another way.

Each partner's profit share is calculated as:

- 8% of their own investment.

- Plus half of the remaining profit after all 8% interests are paid.

Wait, but the 8% interests sum to more than the profit. So perhaps the remaining profit after paying the 8% is negative, which doesn't make sense. So maybe the approach is different.

Alternatively, perhaps the profit is first allocated to pay each partner's 8% interest, and then the remaining is split equally.

But again, the 8% interests sum to $12,800, while the profit is $10k. So the remaining would be negative, which is impossible. So perhaps the 8% is only applied to the profit, but that doesn't align with the question's wording.

Wait, maybe the 8% is applied to each partner's share of the profit. So for each partner, their share is 8% of the profit plus half of the remaining profit.

Wait, that seems off. Let me think differently.

Let me try to model it mathematically. Let me denote the total profit as P = $10,000.

Each partner's share S_A1 and S_Bob.

According to the problem:

S_A1 = 0.08 * A1_investment + 0.5*(P - (0.08*A1_investment + 0.08*Bob_investment))

Wait, no, that can't be right because if the 8% interests sum to more than P, then the remaining would be negative.

Alternatively, perhaps the profit is split such that each partner gets 8% on their own investment, and then any remaining profit is split equally.

But if the total 8% exceeds the profit, perhaps each partner gets a proportion of their 8% based on the profit.

So the ratio would be P / (0.08*A1 + 0.08*Bob) = 10,000 / 12,800 = 0.78125.

So each partner's 8% is multiplied by 0.78125.

Thus:

A1's 8%:5,600 *0.78125=4,375.

Bob's 8%:7,200 *0.78125=5,625.

Then, the remaining profit after this is 10,000 - (4,375 +5,625) = 0. So there's nothing left to split. So each partner's total share is their reduced 8%.

But wait, the question says each receives 8% interest and half of the balance. But if the balance after paying the 8% is zero, then they don't get anything else.

So A1's share is $4,375 and Bob's is $5,625, but looking at the options, none match this.

Wait, perhaps I'm making a mistake in my approach. Let me try another angle.

Another possible interpretation: Each partner's profit share consists of two parts: 8% of their investment, plus half of the remaining profit after all partners have received their 8% interest.

But total 8% is 12,800, which is more than the 10k profit. So in that case, the "balance" would be negative, which doesn't make sense. So perhaps the approach is that the 8% is only applied to the profit, not the investment.

Wait, that would make more sense. Let's try that.

Total profit is $10,000.

Each partner gets 8% of the profit as their interest: 0.08 *10,000=800.

So A1 gets $800, Bob gets $800.

Remaining profit: 10,000 - (800+800) =8,400.

They split this remaining 8,400 equally, so each gets 4,200.

So A1's total share:800 +4,200=5,000.

Bob's:800 +4,200=5,000.

But looking at the options, none have both at 5k. So this approach must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps the 8% is on their own investment, but the remaining profit is split based on their investment ratio.

Wait, perhaps the profit is allocated as follows:

Each partner gets 8% on their investment, but since the total is more than the profit, the profit is divided proportionally based on their investment.

So the total investment is 70k +90k=160k.

A1's share of profit would be (70/160)*10,000=4,375.

Bob's share: (90/160)*10,000=5,625.

But then where does the 8% come in?

Wait, perhaps the 8% is a minimum, and any profit beyond that is split based on their investment.

Wait, but the question says each partner receives 8% interest on their investment and half of the balance.

Maybe the structure is:

Each partner gets 8% of their investment as a priority, and then the remaining profit is split equally.

But when the 8% total exceeds the profit, the 8% can't be fully paid, so the profit is divided proportionally based on their investment.

Hmm, perhaps the correct way is to compute each partner's share as 8% of their investment, and then any remaining profit is split 50-50.

But since the 8% total is 12,800 and profit is 10k, the remaining after 8% is -2,800, which isn't possible. So perhaps the 8% is not a guarantee, and the profit is split based on their investment ratio, with each getting 8% as part of their share.

Wait, maybe the profit is split in a way that each partner's share is 8% of their investment plus half of the remaining profit. But let's model it.

Let me denote:

Profit = 10,000.

A1's share = 0.08*70,000 + 0.5*(10,000 - 0.08*70,000 -0.08*90,000)

Wait, that can't be right because 0.08*70k +0.08*90k=12,800>10k.

So the remaining would be negative, which doesn't make sense.

Alternative approach: The profit is split so that each partner gets 8% on their investment, and then the rest is split equally. But since the 8% exceeds the profit, perhaps each partner's share is their investment's proportion of the profit, which would be (70/160)*10,000=4,375 for A1, and (90/160)*10,000=5,625 for Bob. But this ignores the 8% part.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me look for another angle.

Perhaps the profit is divided such that each partner's share is 8% of their investment, and the remainder is split equally. But when the 8% exceeds the profit, the profit is split proportionally based on their investment.

So, for A1, the maximum they can get is 70/160 of the profit, which is 4,375.

Similarly, Bob gets 5,625.

But in the options, the closest is option J: A1 $4k, Bob $6k. But that's not matching. Or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the profit is distributed by first paying each partner 8% on their investment, and then the remaining is split 50-50. But if the 8% total is more than the profit, then each partner's 8% is scaled down proportionally.

So, the total 8% is 12,800. Profit is 10,000. So the scaling factor is 10,000 /12,800 = 25/32 ≈0.78125.

So each partner's 8% is multiplied by 25/32.

A1:5,600 *25/32= (5,600 /32)=175 *25=4,375.

Bob:7,200 *25/32= (7,200 /32)=225 *25=5,625.

Now, the remaining profit is 10,000 - (4,375+5,625) =0. So no remaining balance to split. Thus, each partner's share is just their scaled 8%: A1 gets 4,375, Bob 5,625.

Looking at the options, none have these exact numbers. So perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 5600 and 7200. That's 8% each, which sums to 12,800, which is more than 10k.

B:4200 and5800. Sum to 10k.

C:3500 and4500.

D:2800 and3600.

E:3800 and5200.

F:4800 and6400.

G:4500 and6500.

H:3000 and4000.

I:3600 and5400.

J:4000 and6000.

Hmm, none have 4375 and5625. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Alternative approach: Maybe each partner's share is calculated as 8% of their investment, and then the remaining profit is
