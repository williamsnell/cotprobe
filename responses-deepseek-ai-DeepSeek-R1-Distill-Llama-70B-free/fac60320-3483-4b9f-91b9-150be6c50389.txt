Question:

A man placed the following advertisement in his local newspaper:"Public Auction Sale . . . without reserve December 7, 10:00 a. m. 110 Walnut St. , City, StateEntire furnishings of home must go: antiques, piano, pool table, appliances, tables, stereo system, etc. "On the morning of December 7, a group of approximately 20 people showed up at the man's home. The first item the man put up for bid was an antique Baldwin grand piano. The man announced that the bidding would be "without reserve" and said, "What's the opening bid on this beautiful Baldwin grand piano?" A woman opened the bidding with $100. The man then commented, "This piano is worth at least $5,000. What other bids am I offered?" When the man did not receive any other bids, he informed the woman that he would not accept $100 and was removing the piano from the sale. If the woman asserts an action against the man for breach of contract, the woman will most likely

Options:

A: prevail, because the auctioneer asked for other bids after the woman's opening bid, validating her bid.
B: prevail, because whether or not the auction is "without reserve," goods cannot be withdrawn after the auctioneer calls for bids.
C: not prevail, because at an auction "without reserve," the auctioneer may withdraw goods until he announces completion of the sale.
D: not prevail, because the auctioneer did not formally accept the woman's bid before withdrawing the piano.
E: not prevail, because at an auction "without reserve," the auctioneer invites offers, which he may accept or reject.
F: prevail, because the auctioneer stated that the piano is worth at least $5,000, implying a minimum bid.
G: not prevail, because the auctioneer has the discretion to withdraw any item from an auction.
H: prevail, because goods put up at an auction "without reserve" may not be withdrawn.
I: prevail, because the auction was advertised as "without reserve," meaning all items must be sold to the highest bidder.
J: not prevail, because the auctioneer has the right to reject any bid he considers too low.

Okay, so I've got this question about an auction gone wrong, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the scenario: A man advertised a public auction sale without reserve. On the day of the auction, a group showed up, and he put up an antique piano for bidding. He announced it's without reserve and asked for an opening bid. A woman bid $100. He said the piano was worth at least $5,000 and asked for other bids, but when none came, he refused the $100 and took the piano off the sale. Now, the woman is suing for breach of contract. The question is, will she win?

I remember that in auctions, the term "without reserve" usually means that the item will be sold to the highest bidder, no matter how low the bid is. But wait, I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact rules. Let me think. Typically, when an auction is without reserve, the seller can't withdraw the item once bidding starts unless there's some condition I'm forgetting.

So the man didn't accept the $100 bid and took the piano away. The woman is claiming breach of contract. I need to determine if the man had the right to do that.

I think the key here is understanding the difference between "with reserve" and "without reserve" auctions. In a "with reserve" auction, the seller can set a minimum price (reserve price) and can withdraw the item if it doesn't reach that price. But without reserve, the item must be sold to the highest bidder, even if it's lower than the seller's expectation.

Wait, but does that mean the seller can't withdraw it once the bidding starts? I think so. So if the auction is without reserve, once the auctioneer starts taking bids, the seller can't just pull the item back. The highest bid, even if it's low, should be accepted.

In this case, the man put the piano up for bid, asked for an opening bid, and the woman gave $100. He then tried to get higher bids but didn't get any. So the only bid was $100. If the auction is without reserve, he should have to accept that bid, right? But he didn't; he withdrew the piano.

So the woman's argument is that there was a contract. When the auctioneer solicits bids, and a bidder makes an offer, and the auctioneer doesn't withdraw the item before the bid is made, the bidder can hold the seller to the sale.

Looking at the options:

Option A says she'll prevail because the auctioneer asked for other bids after her opening, validating her bid. That seems to suggest that her bid was valid once he asked for others.

Option B says she'll prevail because goods can't be withdrawn after the auctioneer calls for bids, regardless of reserve. Hmm, but without reserve is a specific term. Maybe B is more about any auction, but without reserve is a specific rule.

Option C says she won't prevail because in without reserve auctions, the auctioneer can withdraw until sale is completed. Wait, that doesn't sound right. I thought without reserve meant the seller must sell, so withdrawal isn't allowed once bidding starts.

Option D says she won't prevail because he didn't accept the bid before withdrawing. But I think the acceptance in an auction comes when the auctioneer hits the hammer or says "sold." So if he didn't accept, maybe it's not a contract yet. But without reserve might change that.

Option E says she won't prevail because without reserve means the auctioneer can accept or reject offers. That doesn't sound right because without reserve implies the highest bid must be accepted.

Option F says she'll win because he stated the piano's worth, implying a minimum bid. But he didn't set a reserve; he just commented on its value. So that might not count as a reserve price.

Option G says she won't because the auctioneer can withdraw any item. But again, without reserve might prevent that.

Option H says she'll win because without reserve means items can't be withdrawn. That sounds correct.

Option I says she'll win because without reserve means all items must go to the highest bidder. That aligns with what I was thinking.

Option J says she won't because the auctioneer can reject any bid too low. But without reserve, I think he can't do that.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Without reserve means the seller can't set a minimum; the highest bid, even if low, must be accepted. So once the bidding starts, the seller can't withdraw the item. Therefore, the man shouldn't have been able to withdraw the piano after the woman bid.

So looking at the options, options H and I both suggest she'll prevail because of without reserve. Option H says goods can't be withdrawn; I says all items must be sold to highest bidder.

Wait, but in reality, the auctioneer can still withdraw the item before the sale is completed, even in a without reserve auction. Or is that only in with reserve? I'm getting a bit tangled here.

I think that in a without reserve auction, the auctioneer can still withdraw the goods if there are no bids or if the bidding doesn't meet a certain level, but once there's a bid, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the auctioneer can withdraw the item at any time before the hammer falls, regardless of the reserve.

Wait, another angle: when the auction is without reserve, the seller is obliged to sell to the highest bidder, but the auctioneer might still have the discretion to withdraw if no bids meet certain expectations, but in this case, there was a bid. So maybe the man couldn't withdraw once the woman bid, even if it's low.

So looking at the options, I think option C says that at without reserve, the auctioneer can withdraw until sale is completed. That would mean the man could withdraw the piano, so the woman wouldn't prevail.

But earlier I thought that without reserve means he can't withdraw once bidding starts. So which is correct?

I think the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) has something about this. Under UCC ยง 2-328, an auction sale "without reserve" means that the goods will be sold to the highest bidder, and the seller can't withdraw the goods unless no bid is made. So if a bid is made, the seller must accept it.

Wait, but if the auction is without reserve, the seller can't withdraw the goods once bidding starts, unless there's no bid. So in this case, the woman bid, so the seller couldn't withdraw it.

So the man shouldn't have been able to withdraw the piano. Therefore, the woman would prevail because the auction was without reserve, and he couldn't withdraw once there was a bid.

Looking back at the options, option C says she won't prevail because the auctioneer can withdraw until sale is completed, but according to UCC, that's not correct. So option C is wrong.

Option H says she'll prevail because without reserve, goods can't be withdrawn. That sounds correct.

Option I says she'll prevail because without reserve means all items must be sold to the highest bidder. That also sounds correct.

Wait, but what's the difference between H and I? H says goods can't be withdrawn, I says must be sold to highest. Both seem correct, but perhaps H is more specific about the withdrawal, while I is about the sale.

In the scenario, the man withdrew the piano after the woman's bid, so the issue is whether he could withdraw it. So H would be the correct option because it's about withdrawal.

Alternatively, option I is about the sale to the highest bidder, which she was, so that's also correct.

Wait, but the advertisement said "without reserve," which implies that the items must be sold. So both H and I could apply.

Wait, but let me think about the specific rule. The UCC says that in a without reserve auction, the seller cannot withdraw the goods after the auction has begun, except if no bid is made. So once a bid is made, the seller must sell to the highest bidder.

So the woman made a bid, so the man couldn't withdraw the piano. Therefore, the woman can enforce the sale, making the man liable for breach.

So looking at the options:

Option H: prevail, because goods put up at auction without reserve may not be withdrawn.

Option I: prevail, because auction was advertised as without reserve, meaning all items must be sold to the highest bidder.

Which one is more accurate? H is about withdrawal, I is about sale to highest. Since the man withdrew, H would directly address that he couldn't withdraw.

But wait, another point: in an auction without reserve, the auctioneer may still have the discretion to withdraw the goods until the completion of the sale, unless a bid has been made. So if a bid is made, then the auctioneer can't withdraw.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts. Let me try to find the correct rule. Under UCC 2-328(3), when an auction is without reserve, the seller is bound to sell to the highest bidder. However, the auctioneer may still have the right to withdraw the goods if no bid is made, but once a bid is made, the auctioneer can't withdraw.

So in this case, since the woman made a bid, the man couldn't withdraw the piano. Therefore, the woman would prevail.

Looking at the options, option H says she'll prevail because goods can't be withdrawn. Option I says she'll prevail because all items must be sold to highest.

So both H and I seem correct, but perhaps I is more about the outcome of the sale, while H is about the withdrawal.

Wait, but the man didn't sell to the highest bidder; he withdrew the item. So the issue is about withdrawal, not about accepting the highest bid. Therefore, the correct reasoning is that without reserve, the items can't be withdrawn once bidding starts.

Thus, the correct answer would be H.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option C says she won't prevail because the auctioneer can withdraw until sale is completed. That would contradict the UCC rule if the UCC says that once a bid is made, withdrawal isn't allowed.

I think the correct answer is H: prevail, because goods put up at an auction without reserve may not be withdrawn.

But wait, another thought: the auctioneer can withdraw the goods until the sale is completed, but once there is a bid, the auctioneer must accept it. So perhaps the auctioneer can withdraw only if no bid is received.

In this case, the woman made a bid, so the man couldn't withdraw. So option C is incorrect because it says the auctioneer can withdraw until sale is completed, but that's only if no bids are made.

So the correct answer is H: she'll prevail because goods can't be withdrawn.

Wait, but some sources say that in without reserve auctions, the seller can still withdraw the item if the bidding is too low, but I'm not sure. Maybe that's only in with reserve.

Alternatively, perhaps without reserve means that the auctioneer can't set a reserve, but can still accept or reject bids. But that doesn't make sense because without reserve should mean the highest bid must be accepted.

I'm a bit confused now. Let me try to summarize:

- Without reserve: auction must result in a sale to the highest bidder. Once bidding starts, seller can't withdraw.

- With reserve: seller can set a minimum and withdraw if not met.

In this case, without reserve, so once the woman bid, the seller can't withdraw. So the woman's bid should stand.

Therefore, the man breached the contract by not accepting her bid, so she would prevail.

Looking at the options, the correct ones would be H or I.

Option H: prevail because goods can't be withdrawn.

Option I: prevail because all items must be sold to highest bidder.

I think both are correct, but perhaps the more precise reason is H, as it directly addresses withdrawal.

Alternatively, some sources might say that without reserve allows the auctioneer to withdraw until the sale is completed, but I think that's not correct once a bid is made.

Wait, another angle: the advertisement was "without reserve," which is a notification to bidders that the sale is without reserve. So when the auctioneer starts the bidding, the seller is bound to sell to the highest bidder, and can't withdraw.

Therefore, the woman's bid was the only one, and the man had to accept it. So she should prevail.

So the answer is H.

The question revolves around an auction advertised as "without reserve," where the seller refused to accept the only bid received and withdrew the item. The key issue is whether the seller had the right to withdraw the item after bidding had commenced.

Under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) ยง 2-328(3), an auction "without reserve" means the seller is obligated to sell the item to the highest bidder. Once bidding begins, the seller cannot withdraw the item unless no bids are made. In this case, the woman made a bid of $100, so the seller could not lawfully withdraw the piano. By doing so, the seller breached the contract formed when the woman submitted her bid.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. The auctioneer's request for other bids does not validate the woman's bid; the issue is the seller's withdrawal after a bid was made.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. While goods cannot be withdrawn after the auctioneer calls for bids, this is not specific to "without reserve" auctions.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. At a "without reserve" auction, the auctioneer cannot withdraw goods once a bid is made.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. The auctioneer's failure to formally accept the bid does not negate the obligation to sell when a bid is made at a "without reserve" auction.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. At a "without reserve" auction, the auctioneer does not have the discretion to reject the highest bid.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The seller's comment on the piano's value does not imply a reserve price.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The auctioneer's discretion to withdraw items applies only to "with reserve" auctions.
- **Option H**: Correct. At a "without reserve" auction, goods cannot be withdrawn once bidding has started.
- **Option I**: Also correct but less precise. While it is true that items must be sold to the highest bidder, the specific issue here is the withdrawal of the item after a bid was made.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. The auctioneer cannot reject a bid at a "without reserve" auction once it is the highest bid.

The most precise answer is **Option H**, as it directly addresses the prohibition on withdrawing goods after bidding has commenced in a "without reserve" auction.

Answer: H
