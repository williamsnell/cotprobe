Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm a bit confused, but I'll try to work through it step by step. The question is asking, "What is the square root of 81 squared?" And there are multiple-choice options from A to J.

Hmm, let's break it down. First, I need to understand what "81 squared" means. Squaring a number means multiplying it by itself. So 81 squared is 81 times 81. Wait, but I don't think I need to calculate that right away because the question is about the square root of that result.

Wait, the square root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number. So if I take the square root of 81 squared, it should bring me back to 81, right? Because (square root of (81^2)) is 81. But wait, isn't that always the case? Like, the square root of x squared is x, assuming x is positive, which 81 definitely is.

But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing something. Sometimes in math, especially with exponents, there are some gotchas. Oh, right! When you take the square root of a square, you technically get the absolute value. But since 81 is positive, the square root of 81 squared is just 81. So the answer should be 81, which is option I.

Wait, but let me look at the options again. Option J is 9. Oh, wait a second! Maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Let me read it again. It says, "the square root of 81 squared." So that's sqrt(81^2). Which is 81, because 81^2 is 6561, and the square root of 6561 is 81. So the correct answer should be I:81.

But wait, another thought. Sometimes people get confused between square roots and exponents. Let me think. If I have sqrt(81), that's 9. And if I square 9, that's 81. So in this case, the question is about the square root of 81 squared, which is sqrt(81^2)=81.

Alternatively, maybe the question is a bit of a trick. Let me see the options again. Option A is 9 squared, which is 81. Option I is 81, which is what I thought. So the correct answer should be I:81.

But wait, why is option J there as 9? Because 81's square root is 9. So if the question was "the square root of 81," then J would be correct. But it's the square root of 81 squared. So yeah, I'm confident it's I:81.

The question asks for the square root of 81 squared. To solve this, we recognize that squaring a number and then taking its square root returns the original number. Specifically, \( \sqrt{81^2} = 81 \). Among the options provided, the correct answer is **I: 81**.

Answer: I
