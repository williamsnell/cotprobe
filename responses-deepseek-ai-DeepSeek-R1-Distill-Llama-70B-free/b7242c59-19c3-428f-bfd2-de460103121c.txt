Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about some markings on mud-bricks from Huaca del Sol. I'm a bit rusty on my archaeology, but let me think this through.

First, let's break down the question. It's asking about the purpose of the markings found on the mud-bricks of Huaca del Sol. The options are A through D, and I need to figure out which one is most likely correct.

I remember that Huacas were ceremonial centers in ancient Peru, especially associated with the Inca civilization. Huaca del Sol, which translates to "Temple of the Sun," was probably an important religious site. Now, the question is about the markings on the bricks used to build this structure.

Option A suggests these are instructions for the builders written by engineers. I'm not sure about this. If they were instructions, they might be more complex or standardized. Plus, I don't recall the Inca having a written language. They used quipus for record-keeping, which were knotted strings, not written scripts. So if there were written instructions, maybe it's less likely.

Option B says they're random scratches without meaning. That seems possible. Sometimes markings on bricks could just be accidental or not part of a formal system. But I think in many ancient structures, especially ceremonial ones, the markings often have some significance, so I'm not sure if B is correct.

Option C proposes that the markings identify the local group that made them. This rings a bell. I've heard that in some ancient cultures, including Inca, workers or different groups would mark their bricks with symbols to indicate which group contributed. It was a way of tracking labor contributions or taking pride in their work. So this makes sense as a possibility.

Option D suggests simple arithmetic by carpenters. Again, considering the Inca didn't have a written language, arithmetic in the form of script seems unlikely. They might have used quipus for numerical records, but not written on bricks. So D doesn't seem right.

Thinking back, the Inca Empire didn't leave behind written records because they didn't have a writing system. Their records were oral or via quipus. So any markings on bricks wouldn't be a written script, which rules out A and D. Between B and C, I think C is more plausible because it's common in many cultures to have markers indicating the group or origin of the materials.

So, putting it all together, the answer should be C: intended to identify the local group that had produced them.

The markings found on the mud-bricks of Huaca del Sol are most likely intended to identify the local group that produced them. This aligns with practices in many ancient cultures, including the Inca, where such markings served to track labor contributions or signify group identity. The Inca lacked a written language, making options involving written instructions or arithmetic unlikely. Random scratches are possible but less probable given the ceremonial context of Huaca del Sol. Thus, the most plausible answer is:

C
