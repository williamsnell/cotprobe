Question:

A super market has two cans of the same brand of tuna fish. The 7(1 / 2) ounce can sells for 57 cents, and the 8(1 / 4) ounce can sells for 64 cents. Which can is the better buy?

Options:

A: None of the cans
B: The first can
C: The second can is better by 7 cents per ounce
D: The second can is better by 5 cents per ounce
E: The second can is better only when buying in bulk
F: The first can is better by 10 cents per ounce
G: The second can
H: Both cans are better buys on alternate days
I: Both cans are the same
J: The first can is better when considering nutritional value

Okay, so I've got this problem here about two cans of tuna fish, and I need to figure out which one is the better buy. Let me see... The question gives me the sizes and prices of both cans. 

First, I should probably calculate the price per ounce for each can. That way, I can compare them directly and see which one is cheaper per unit of tuna. 

The first can is 7 and a half ounces, which I think is 7.5 ounces. It sells for 57 cents. So to find the price per ounce, I'll divide 57 by 7.5. Let me do that math... 57 divided by 7.5. Hmm, 7.5 times 7 is 52.5, and 7.5 times 7.6 would be 57, right? Wait, because 7.5 * 7 = 52.5, so 57 - 52.5 is 4.5. Then 4.5 divided by 7.5 is 0.6. So adding that to 7, it's 7.6 cents per ounce. So 57 / 7.5 equals 7.6 cents per ounce. 

Now the second can is 8 and a quarter ounces, which is 8.25 ounces, and it sells for 64 cents. So I'll do the same thing: 64 divided by 8.25. Let me think about this. 8.25 times 7 is 57.75, and 8.25 times 7.8 is 64.35, which is a bit over. So maybe 7.76? Wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately. 

Alternatively, I can multiply numerator and denominator by 4 to make it easier. Because 8.25 is the same as 33/4, so 64 divided by (33/4) is 64 * (4/33) = (64*4)/33 = 256/33. Let me compute that. 33 times 7 is 231, subtract that from 256 gives 25. So 7 and 25/33, which is approximately 7.7575... So around 7.76 cents per ounce.

Wait, so the first can is 7.6 cents per ounce, and the second is about 7.76. That means the first can is cheaper per ounce. So the first can is a better buy because it costs less per ounce.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's redo the first can: 57 cents for 7.5 ounces. 57 divided by 7.5. Oh wait, 7.5 times 7 is 52.5, and 57 minus 52.5 is 4.5. So 4.5 is 0.6 of 7.5 (since 7.5 * 0.6 = 4.5). So yes, 7.6 cents per ounce. 

Second can: 64 / 8.25. Let me write this as a fraction: 64/8.25. Multiply numerator and denominator by 100 to eliminate decimals: 6400 / 825. Simplify this fraction by dividing numerator and denominator by 25: 256 / 33. So 256 divided by 33 is approximately 7.7575, which is about 7.76 cents per ounce.

So the first can is cheaper per ounce. Therefore, the first can (7.5 oz for 57 cents) is the better buy.

Now looking at the options, let's see. The options are A through J. 

Option B says the first can. Option C says the second is better by 7 cents per ounce. Wait, but according to my calculations, the first can is cheaper. So the second can is more expensive, so it's not better. So options C and D are incorrect because they say the second can is better, which isn't the case. 

Option B is correct, but let me check other options. Option G says the second can. No, that's wrong. Option I says both are the same, which isn't true. Option F says the first can is better by 10 cents per ounce. Wait, the first is 7.6, second 7.76, so the difference is about 0.16 cents per ounce. So F is incorrect because it's not 10 cents difference. 

So the correct answer should be option B: The first can. 

Wait, but let me look at the options again. Option B is "The first can." So that's the choice. So the answer is option B.

To determine which can of tuna is the better buy, we calculate the price per ounce for each can.

1. **First can**:  
   - Size: 7.5 ounces  
   - Price: 57 cents  
   - Price per ounce: \( \frac{57}{7.5} = 7.6 \) cents per ounce  

2. **Second can**:  
   - Size: 8.25 ounces  
   - Price: 64 cents  
   - Price per ounce: \( \frac{64}{8.25} \approx 7.76 \) cents per ounce  

Comparing the two, the first can has a lower price per ounce (7.6 cents vs. 7.76 cents). Therefore, the first can is the better buy.  

Analyzing the options:  
- **Option B** correctly states that the first can is the better buy.  
- Other options either incorrectly claim the second can is better or misstate the price difference.  

Thus, the correct answer is **B**.
