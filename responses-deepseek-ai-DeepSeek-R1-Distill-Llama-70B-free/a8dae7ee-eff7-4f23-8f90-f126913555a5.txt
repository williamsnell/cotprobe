Okay, so I've got this baseball trivia question here, and I need to figure out the correct answer. The question is asking which famous baseball figure was acquitted at a court-martial for insubordination. The options are A through J, each a different baseball personality.

First, I should probably go through each option one by one and think about what I know about each of them. Maybe that'll help me remember any details about their military service or legal issues.

Starting with option A: Babe Ruth. He's one of the most iconic players, known as "The Sultan of Swat." I don't recall anything about him being in a court-martial. He was a larger-than-life figure, but I think his issues were more with his weight and personal life rather than military insubordination.

Option B: Ty Cobb. He was a fierce competitor and had a reputation for being rough, both on and off the field. I remember he was involved in some controversial incidents, including a fight where he attacked a spectator. But was he in the military? I think during World War I, he served, but did he get court-martialed? I'm not sure. I'll have to think more about this one.

Option C: Hank Aaron. He's famous for breaking Babe Ruth's home run record. I don't think he had any military issues. He was more known for his baseball career and the challenges he faced with racism during his time.

Option D: Willie Mays. Another all-time great, known as "The Say Hey Kid." He did serve in the military, I believe in the Army during the Korean War. But was he ever court-martialed? I don't remember anything like that. He was more known for his baseball prowess.

Option E: Joe DiMaggio. A legendary player with the Yankees, known for his hitting streak. He served in the military during World War II, but I don't think he had any disciplinary issues. He was more of a hero figure.

Option F: Abner Doubleday. Wait, he's often credited with inventing baseball, though that's actually a myth. But he was a real person, a Civil War general. If he was involved in a court-martial, maybe for insubordination, but I'm not sure. I think he was a career military officer, but I don't recall any specific incidents where he was acquitted.

Option G: Ted Williams. He was a Hall of Fame hitter, also served in the military, I think in both WWII and Korea. He was a fighter pilot. But was he court-martialed? I don't remember anything like that. He had a distinguished military career.

Option H: Jackie Robinson. He broke the color barrier in baseball. Before his MLB career, he was in the Army during WWII. Oh wait, I think he did face a court-martial. Let me think. From what I remember, Jackie Robinson was court-martialed for refusing to give up his seat on a bus, similar to Rosa Parks, but this was in 1944, before Parks' famous act. He was acquitted, though, because the charges were dropped. So that fits the question.

Option I: Billy Martin. He was a player and later a manager known for his fiery personality. I don't think he had a military court-martial. His issues were more with his temper and managing style.

Option J: Mickey Mantle. Another Yankees legend, but I don't recall him having any military issues. He served, but I don't think he was court-martialed.

So putting it all together, the key points are: a baseball figure who was acquitted in a court-martial for insubordination. From what I remember, Jackie Robinson faced a court-martial during his time in the Army for not moving to the back of a bus, which was a segregation issue. He was indeed acquitted because they couldn't proceed with the charges, possibly due to the circumstances or support he received.

So the correct answer should be H: Jackie Robinson.

The correct answer is H: Jackie Robinson. Jackie Robinson was acquitted at a court-martial for insubordination after refusing to give up his seat on a segregated bus in 1944, an act that preceded Rosa Parks' famous protest. 

Answer: H
