Okay, so I have this physics problem here about pressure in a car tire changing with temperature. Hmm, I remember that pressure and temperature are related in gases, probably through the ideal gas law. Let me think.

The problem says the gauge pressure in winter is 30 psi at 32°F. Then in summer, the temperature rises to 122°F, and we need to find the new gauge pressure. Oh wait, the volume doesn't change and no air leaks, so the amount of gas is constant. So this must be a case where we can apply Gay-Lussac's Law, which deals with pressure and temperature when volume is constant.

Gay-Lussac's Law is P1/T1 = P2/T2, right? But wait, I think temperature has to be in Kelvin for this to work. Oh right, because temperature in the ideal gas law is absolute. So I need to convert Fahrenheit to Kelvin.

How do I convert Fahrenheit to Kelvin? Let me recall. First, convert to Celsius, then add 273.15. The formula is K = (°F - 32) × 5/9 + 273.15. 

So for winter: 32°F. Converting that to Celsius is (32-32)*5/9 = 0°C. Then 0 + 273.15 = 273.15 K.

For summer: 122°F. Let's calculate that. Subtract 32: 122-32=90. Multiply by 5/9: 90*(5/9)=50°C. Then add 273.15: 50 + 273.15 = 323.15 K.

Wait, but the pressure given is gauge pressure. Gauge pressure is the pressure above atmospheric. Oh right, so the absolute pressure would be gauge pressure plus atmospheric pressure. Oh, right! Because the ideal gas law uses absolute pressure, not gauge.

So the initial pressure P1 is 30 psi gauge. Atmospheric pressure is about 14.7 psi at sea level. So P1 absolute is 30 + 14.7 = 44.7 psia.

P2 will be the new absolute pressure. Then after finding P2, we subtract atmospheric pressure to get the gauge pressure again.

So applying Gay-Lussac's Law: (P1 / T1) = (P2 / T2). Rearranged, P2 = P1 * (T2 / T1).

Plugging in the numbers: P1 is 44.7 psia, T1 273.15 K, T2 323.15 K.

So P2 = 44.7 * (323.15 / 273.15). Let me calculate that.

First, compute the ratio 323.15 / 273.15. Let me do that division. Hmm, 273.15 times 1.18 is approximately 323. So let me compute 323.15 divided by 273.15.

323.15 / 273.15 = 1.183 approximately.

So P2 = 44.7 * 1.183 ≈ let's calculate that. 44.7 * 1.18 would be around 44.7 *1=44.7, 44.7 *0.18≈8.05. So total about 52.75. But wait, more accurately:

44.7 * 1.183 = ?

Let me do it step by step. 44.7 *1 =44.7. 44.7 *0.1=4.47. 44.7 *0.08=3.576. 44.7 *0.003=0.1341.

Adding those up: 44.7 +4.47=49.17; +3.576=52.746; +0.1341≈52.88. So about 52.88 psia.

Now subtract atmospheric pressure to get gauge pressure: 52.88 -14.7 =38.18 psi. Hmm, so approximately 38.18 psig.

Looking at the options, option H is 38.2 psig. So that's the closest.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I approximated too much. Let's compute 323.15 / 273.15 more accurately.

323.15 divided by 273.15.

Let me compute 273.15 * 1.18 = 273.15 *1=273.15, 273.15 *0.18=49.167. So 273.15+49.167=322.317. So 1.18 gives about 322.317, which is just a bit less than 323.15. The difference is 323.15 -322.317=0.833.

So let's find how much more than 1.18 it is. 0.833 / 273.15 ≈ approx 0.003. So the ratio is approximately 1.183.

So P2 =44.7 *1.183 = let's compute more accurately.

44.7 * 1.183.

Compute 44.7 *1=44.7.

44.7 *0.1 =4.47.

44.7 *0.08 = 3.576.

44.7 *0.003=0.1341.

Adding these: 44.7 +4.47=49.17; +3.576=52.746; +0.1341=52.8801.

So P2 is 52.8801 psia.

Subtract 14.7 to get gauge: 52.8801 -14.7=38.1801, so 38.18 psig.

Looking back at the options, option H is 38.2 psig. So the correct answer is H.

To solve the problem, we apply Gay-Lussac's Law, which states that pressure and temperature are directly proportional when volume is constant. The relationship is given by:

\[
\frac{P_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2}{T_2}
\]

Here, \(P_1\) and \(T_1\) are the initial pressure and temperature, and \(P_2\) and \(T_2\) are the final pressure and temperature. However, the ideal gas law requires absolute pressure and absolute temperature. 

### Step 1: Convert temperatures to Kelvin
The initial temperature is \(32^\circ \text{F}\), which converts to Celsius as:
\[
T_1 = (32 - 32) \times \frac{5}{9} + 273.15 = 273.15 \, \text{K}.
\]
The final temperature is \(122^\circ \text{F}\), which converts to Celsius as:
\[
T_2 = (122 - 32) \times \frac{5}{9} + 273.15 = 323.15 \, \text{K}.
\]

### Step 2: Convert gauge pressure to absolute pressure
The initial gauge pressure is \(30 \, \text{psig}\). Adding atmospheric pressure (\(14.7 \, \text{psia}\)) gives the initial absolute pressure:
\[
P_1 = 30 + 14.7 = 44.7 \, \text{psia}.
\]

### Step 3: Apply Gay-Lussac's Law
Using the formula:
\[
P_2 = P_1 \cdot \frac{T_2}{T_1},
\]
we calculate:
\[
P_2 = 44.7 \cdot \frac{323.15}{273.15}.
\]
The temperature ratio is approximately:
\[
\frac{323.15}{273.15} \approx 1.183.
\]
Thus:
\[
P_2 = 44.7 \cdot 1.183 \approx 52.88 \, \text{psia}.
\]

### Step 4: Convert back to gauge pressure
Subtract atmospheric pressure to find the final gauge pressure:
\[
P_2 = 52.88 - 14.7 = 38.18 \, \text{psig}.
\]

### Step 5: Match the closest option
The closest option to \(38.18 \, \text{psig}\) is \(38.2 \, \text{psig}\), which corresponds to **Option H**.
