Question:

A physician is conducting a retrospective review of a trial involving the use of Drug X in patients with a specific disease. It is known that Drug X is associated with an increased probability of cancer in patients who use the drug. A total of 600 individuals with a specific disease were included in the trial. Of the participants, 200 individuals received Drug X and 400 individuals did not receive it. One hundred individuals who received Drug X died of a particular type of cancer and 100 individuals who did not receive the drug died of the same type of cancer. Based on these data, which of the following is the relative risk of death from this type of cancer in individuals who take Drug X as compared with individuals who do not take Drug X?

Options:

A: Individuals who take Drug X have two times the risk of dying from this type of cancer
B: Individuals who take Drug X have four times the risk of dying from this type of cancer
C: Individuals who take Drug X have three times the risk of dying from this type of cancer
D: Individuals who take Drug X have six times the risk of dying from this type of cancer
E: Individuals who do not take Drug X have three times the risk of dying from this type of cancer
F: Individuals who take Drug X have half the risk of dying from this type of cancer
G: Individuals who take Drug X have an equal risk of dying from this type of cancer
H: Individuals who do not take Drug X have two times the risk of dying from this type of cancer
I: Individuals who take Drug X have five times the risk of dying from this type of cancer
J: Individuals who take Drug X have zero risk of dying from this type of cancer

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this relative risk question. Hmm, let's see. I remember that relative risk is the ratio of the probability of an event occurring in the exposed group versus the non-exposed group. So in this case, the exposed group is the people who took Drug X, and the non-exposed are those who didn't.

The question says that 600 individuals were in the trial. Out of them, 200 received Drug X and 400 didn't. Then, 100 from the Drug X group died of a particular cancer, and 100 from the non-Drug X group also died of the same cancer.

Wait, so I need to calculate the risk in each group first. Risk is the number of events divided by the total in the group. So for the Drug X group, it's the number who died (100) divided by the total in that group (200). Let me compute that: 100/200 = 0.5, which is 50% risk.

For the non-Drug X group, it's 100 deaths out of 400. So 100/400 is 0.25, which is 25% risk.

Now, relative risk is the risk in the exposed group divided by the risk in the non-exposed. So that's 0.5 / 0.25. Let me do that division: 0.5 divided by 0.25 is 2. So the relative risk is 2.

Looking back at the options, option A says individuals who take Drug X have two times the risk. Yeah, that matches. So the answer should be A.

Wait, did I get that right? Let me double-check. Drug X group: 100 dead out of 200, so 50%. Non-Drug: 100/400 is 25%. RR is 50/25 = 2. So yes, option A is correct.

The relative risk of death from cancer in individuals taking Drug X compared to those not taking it is calculated by dividing the risk in the exposed group by the risk in the non-exposed group. 

- **Drug X group**: 100 deaths out of 200 individuals → Risk = 100/200 = 0.5 (50%).
- **Non-Drug X group**: 100 deaths out of 400 individuals → Risk = 100/400 = 0.25 (25%).
- **Relative Risk (RR)** = Risk in Drug X group / Risk in Non-Drug X group = 0.5 / 0.25 = 2.

Thus, individuals who take Drug X have two times the risk of dying from this type of cancer.
