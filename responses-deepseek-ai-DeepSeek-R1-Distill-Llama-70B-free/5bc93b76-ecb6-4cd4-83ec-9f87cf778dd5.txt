Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let me read it again: "In how many ways can 5 students be selected from a group of 6 students?" And there are multiple choice options from A to J.

Hmm, I remember this has something to do with combinations because the order of selection doesn't matter when picking students. When you're choosing a group where the order isn't important, like selecting team members, it's a combination problem, not a permutation.

So the formula for combinations is n choose k, which is n! / (k!(n-k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number you want to choose. In this case, n is 6 and k is 5.

Let me calculate that. Plugging in the numbers: 6! / (5! * (6-5)!). Wait, 6! is 720, 5! is 120, and (6-5)! is 1! which is 1. So that would be 720 / (120 * 1) = 720 / 120 = 6. So the answer should be 6 ways. 

But wait, let me double-check. Alternatively, when you choose 5 out of 6, it's the same as leaving out one. So how many ways can you leave out one? Well, there are 6 students, so you can leave out any one of them. That would give 6 possible groups. Yep, that makes sense.

Looking at the options, option F is 6. So I think that's the correct answer.

The problem asks for the number of ways to select 5 students from a group of 6. This is a combination problem since the order of selection doesn't matter. Using the combination formula:

\[
\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
\]

Here, \( n = 6 \) and \( k = 5 \), so:

\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{720}{120 \cdot 1} = 6
\]

Thus, there are 6 ways to select the students. Option F corresponds to 6.
