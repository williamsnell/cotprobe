Okay, so I've got this question about consequentialist theories and Dershowitz's view on justifying terrorism. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think it through.

First, the question is asking what kind of consequentialist theory Dershowitz thinks can justify terrorism in extreme cases. The options are from A to J, each representing different ethical theories.

I remember that consequentialist theories are those where the morality of an action is determined by its outcomes. The main two I know are Act Utilitarianism and Rule Utilitarianism. Act Utilitarianism says that an action is right if it produces the greatest good for the greatest number in that specific situation. Rule Utilitarianism, on the other hand, focuses on following rules that, when generally followed, lead to the best outcomes.

Now, the question mentions Dershowitz. I think he's a legal scholar, maybe Alan Dershowitz? I recall he's written about the ethics of terrorism and torture. From what I remember, he's argued that in very extreme cases, like the 'ticking time bomb' scenario, certain actions that are normally wrong might be justified if they prevent a greater evil.

Wait, so if we're talking about justifying actions based on their consequences in specific situations, that sounds like Act Utilitarianism. Because it's about the consequences of that particular act, not about following a general rule.

Rule Utilitarianism would be more about whether the action conforms to a rule that, if universally followed, would maximize utility. But in extreme cases where breaking the rule leads to a better outcome, Act Utilitarianism would allow that.

So looking at the options, F is Act Utilitarianism and G is Rule Utilitarianism. The question is about justifying terrorism in particular cases, which suggests looking at individual actions rather than general rules.

Therefore, the answer should be F: Act Utilitarianism.

The question asks which consequentialist theory Dershowitz believes can justify terrorism in extreme cases. Consequentialist theories focus on the outcomes of actions, with Act and Rule Utilitarianism being key variants. Act Utilitarianism evaluates actions based on their specific consequences, while Rule Utilitarianism considers adherence to rules that maximize overall utility.

Dershowitz, likely referring to Alan Dershowitz, has argued that in extreme scenarios, actions like terrorism might be justified if they prevent greater harm. This aligns with Act Utilitarianism, which assesses each action's consequences individually rather than adhering to general rules. Therefore, the correct answer is Act Utilitarianism.

Answer: F
