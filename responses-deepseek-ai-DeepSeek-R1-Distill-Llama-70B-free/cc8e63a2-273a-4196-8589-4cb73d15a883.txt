Question:

After reviewing the end-user computing (EUC) policy of an organization, an internal auditor audits the actuarial function and notices that some minimum control requirements are missing. Which of the following is a risk of using potentially incorrect enduser developed files?

Options:

A: Inaccurate EUC files lead to flawed strategic planning.

C: EUC systems are not compatible with other systems in the organization.
D: Management has to dedicate more resources to maintain EUC systems.
E: Management receives limited information for decision making due to a lack of flexibility in EUC files.
F: EUC files become obsolete quickly, requiring frequent updates.
G: Management experiences difficulty in tracking changes made to files in EUC systems.
H: Management is unable to respond to competitive pressures quickly.
I: Management places the same degree of reliance on the files as they do on files generated from mainframe systems.

Okay, so I have this question about end-user computing (EUC) policies and the risks associated with incorrect end-user developed files. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this topic, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the question says that an internal auditor is reviewing the EUC policy and found some missing minimum control requirements. The risk here is about using potentially incorrect end-user developed files. I need to pick the correct option from A to J.

First, I should understand what EUC is. From what I remember, EUC refers to systems or applications developed by end-users, often using tools like spreadsheets, databases, or other software. These are usually created to support specific business functions without relying on the central IT department.

So the problem is that some minimum controls are missing. Controls in EUC are important to ensure that these systems are accurate, reliable, and secure. If controls are missing, there could be various risks.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Inaccurate EUC files lead to flawed strategic planning. That makes sense because if the data is wrong, decisions based on it would be bad. But I'm not sure if this is the most direct risk mentioned in the question.

Option B: Management incurs additional costs because tasks take more time. Maybe, but it's more about efficiency rather than incorrect files' risks.

Option C: EUC systems are incompatible with other systems. That's a possible issue, but not directly related to incorrect files causing a specific risk.

Option D: More resources to maintain EUC systems. Again, more about maintenance effort than incorrect files leading to a problem.

Option E: Limited information for decision-making due to lack of flexibility. Not sure how this ties directly to incorrect files.

Option F: Files become obsolete quickly. That's about updates, not incorrect data.

Option G: Difficulty tracking changes. If controls are missing, version control could be an issue, leading to incorrect files. This seems relevant.

Option H: Can't respond to competitive pressures quickly. More about agility, which might be a secondary effect.

Option I: Management places the same reliance on EUC files as mainframe. Oh, wait, if EUC files are incorrect but management trusts them as much as reliable mainframe systems, that could lead to using wrong data for decisions. That's a risk.

Option J: EUC lacks security, risking unauthorized access. That's a security risk, but the question is about incorrect files, not unauthorized access.

So the question is about the risk of incorrect EUC files. The key here is that if these files are incorrect but management doesn't know, they might use them as if they were correct.

Option I says management relies on them the same as mainframe systems. Mainframe systems usually have more controls and are more reliable. So if EUC files are wrong but used with the same trust, decisions could be flawed.

Alternatively, Option A says the files lead to flawed strategic planning. That's also a possible consequence.

Wait, the question is about the risk of using potentially incorrect files. So it's about the consequence of their inaccuracy.

Option A is about the outcome (flawed planning) because of inaccuracy. Option I is about the misplaced trust leading to using bad data as if it's good.

Which is the more direct risk? The question says the risk is because the files are potentially incorrect. So the risk is that decisions are based on wrong data, leading to bad outcomes.

Alternatively, option I's risk is that management trusts them equally, leading to the same issue.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn. Let me think again.

If the EUC files are incorrect but management doesn't realize it, they might make wrong decisions. So the immediate risk is that the information is wrong, leading to flawed planning (Option A) or other decisions.

But Option I is about relying on them as if they were correct, which would make the impact worse. So perhaps both A and I are correct, but the question asks for the risk of using incorrect files.

Wait, the question is which is a risk of using potentially incorrect EUC files. So the risk is that management might be using incorrect data without knowing, leading to bad decisions.

So Option A is about the consequence of inaccuracy. Option I is about the fact that they trust EUC as much as mainframe, which might be a separate risk.

Alternatively, perhaps the risk is that when management doesn't have proper controls, they can't track changes, leading to incorrect files (but that's more of a control issue, not the risk of using incorrect files).

Wait, the question is about the risk of using incorrect files, not the cause. So the risk is the impact of having incorrect data.

So the answer is either A or I.

In my notes, I remember that one of the key risks of EUC is that management may place undue reliance on them, assuming they're as reliable as formal systems. So if the EUC files are incorrect, but management uses them with the same confidence, that's a big risk.

So Option I would be the correct answer because it points out that management's reliance is misplaced, leading to using incorrect data in decisions.

Wait, but the question says the risk is because the files are incorrect. So the direct risk is that decisions are flawed, which is Option A. Or is it that management trusts them, making the incorrect data impactful?

I think the more direct risk is that the information is wrong, so Option A. But I'm a bit confused.

Alternatively, if the files are incorrect and management doesn't know, they might use them as if correct, leading to wrong decisions. So Option I's point is that management treats EUC files as reliable as mainframe, so the risk is that they're using bad data without knowing.

Hmm, perhaps the answer is A.

Wait, I think in the context of internal control, the risk is that management doesn't realize the EUC files are wrong, so they use them, leading to bad decisions. So the risk is the inaccuracy leading to flawed planning, which is Option A.

Alternatively, if management's degree of reliance is the same, then they might not have done proper validation, leading to using incorrect data.

I'm a bit stuck between A and I. But I think the correct answer is A: Inaccurate EUC files lead to flawed strategic planning.

Wait, but another thought: the question mentions that some minimum control requirements are missing. So without proper controls, the EUC files might be incorrect, and management might not be aware. So when they use these files for strategic planning, the data is wrong, leading to flawed strategies. So that would be Option A.

Yes, I think that's the case. So the answer is A.

The question revolves around the risks associated with using potentially incorrect end-user developed files (EUC files) when minimum control requirements are missing. EUC files are often created by end-users to support specific business functions, but without proper controls, their accuracy and reliability can be compromised. The key risk lies in the potential consequences of using incorrect or unreliable data for decision-making.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Inaccurate EUC files leading to flawed strategic planning is a direct consequence of using incorrect data. If the files are wrong, decisions based on them will likely be flawed, making this a strong candidate.
- **Option I**: Management placing the same degree of reliance on EUC files as on mainframe systems highlights a risk of misplaced trust. However, this is more about the perception of reliability rather than the direct impact of incorrect files.

The question specifically asks about the risk of using potentially incorrect EUC files. While Option I addresses the issue of trust, the more direct and immediate risk is the impact of inaccurate data on decision-making, which is best captured by Option A. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**A: Inaccurate EUC files lead to flawed strategic planning.**
