Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about a steel rod under stress. Hmm, let me try to think through this step by step. I'm a bit rusty on my mechanics of materials, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the problem says there's a steel rod that's 2.0 meters long. Its cross-sectional area is 0.30 cm². Oh wait, I remember that stress is related to force and area, and strain has to do with the elongation over the original length. Oh right, and Young's modulus comes into play here, which I think is the modulus of elasticity for the material.

So the setup is that the rod is hung from one end, and a 550-kg milling machine is hung from the other end. I need to find the stress, strain, and elongation. The question gives options from A to J, but I don't know which ones correspond to which values. Oh wait, the problem mentions the unit for the answer is in mm. So the elongation is probably the last part, and the options are for that.

Wait, no, the question asks for stress, strain, and elongation, but the options are labeled A to J without specifying which part. Hmm, maybe I need to calculate each and see which option matches one of them. Or perhaps the question is asking for the elongation in mm. Let me read the question again.

Ah, the question says "determine the stress on the rod and the resulting strain and elongation. (Unit: mm)". Oh, so the unit is mm for the elongation part. But the question is a multiple-choice, so I guess each option is a possible value for one of the three parts. Hmm, but the options don't specify, so perhaps I'm to calculate each and then pick the one that matches the correct answer. Or maybe the question is only about the elongation. Wait, the way the question is phrased isn't entirely clear, but given that the options are single values, perhaps the question is about the elongation in mm. Let me proceed.

So, first, I'll calculate the stress. Stress is force divided by area. The force here is the weight of the milling machine. Since mass is 550 kg, the force is mass times gravity. I'll use g as 9.8 m/s².

So, force F = m * g = 550 kg * 9.8 m/s². Let me compute that: 550 * 9.8. Hmm, 500*9.8 is 4900, and 50*9.8 is 490, so total is 5390 N. So F is 5390 Newtons.

The cross-sectional area A is 0.30 cm². Wait, I need to convert that to m² because the units for stress are in Pascals, which are N/m². So 1 cm² is (0.01 m)^2 = 1e-4 m². So 0.30 cm² is 0.30 * 1e-4 m² = 3e-5 m².

So stress σ = F/A = 5390 N / 3e-5 m². Let me compute that: 5390 / 3e-5. Hmm, 5390 divided by 3 is approximately 1796.666..., so 1796.666... divided by 1e-5 is 179,666.666... Pascals. So about 179,666.67 Pa. Or approximately 1.8e5 Pa.

Wait, but I'm not sure if I did that correctly. Let me double-check. Oh, wait, 3e-5 is 0.00003. So 5390 divided by 0.00003. Let me compute 5390 / 0.00003. 5390 divided by 3 is 1796.666..., so 1796.666... divided by 0.00001 (since 0.00003 is 3 times 0.00001) would be 179,666.666... So yes, same as before. So σ ≈ 179,666.67 Pa.

Wait, maybe I should write that as 1.796666...e5 Pa, which is approximately 1.8e5 Pa. Hmm, but the options don't seem to have anything like that. Wait, looking at the options, they are all in the 1 to 4 range. So perhaps I'm miscalculating something. Oh wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the units somewhere.

Wait, let me go back. The cross-sectional area is 0.30 cm². So 0.30 cm² is 0.30 * (1e-2 m)^2. Because 1 cm is 0.01 m, so squared is 1e-4 m². So 0.30 * 1e-4 = 3e-5 m². So that part seems correct.

Hmm, maybe I should calculate the stress in a different unit. Oh wait, perhaps the problem expects the stress in MPa (mega pascals), which is common for steel. So 179,666.67 Pa is 0.179666... MPa. Hmm, that doesn't seem right either because steel's Young's modulus is around 200 GPa. Wait, that would make sense. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me check the calculation again. F = 550 kg * 9.8 m/s² = 550 * 9.8. Let me compute that accurately. 550 * 9 = 4950, 550 * 0.8 = 440, so total is 5390 N. That's correct.

Area is 0.30 cm² = 0.30 * (1e-2 m)^2 = 0.30 * 1e-4 m² = 3e-5 m². So F/A is 5390 / 3e-5. Let me compute that as 5390 / 0.00003. So 5390 divided by 0.00003. Let me see, 0.00003 times 100,000 is 3, so 5390 / 0.00003 = (5390 / 3) * 100,000. 5390 divided by 3 is approximately 1796.666..., so 1796.666... * 100,000 = 179,666,666.666... Pa. Wait, that can't be right because that's 179.666... MPa.

Oh wait, wait! I think I messed up the calculation. Let me do it properly.

5390 N divided by 3e-5 m². Let me write it as 5390 / 3e-5.

So 3e-5 is 0.00003. So 5390 / 0.00003 = ?

Let me write it as (5390 / 3) * (1 / 0.00001) ) because 0.00003 = 3 * 0.00001.

So 5390 / 3 is about 1796.666... Then, 1 / 0.00001 is 100,000. So 1796.666... * 100,000 = 179,666,666.666... Pa. Which is 179.666... MPa.

Wait, that's way higher than what I initially thought. So stress is about 179.67 MPa.

But wait, steel's yield strength is typically around 250 MPa or so, so this seems plausible. So that's the stress.

Next, strain. Strain is stress divided by Young's modulus. I remember that Young's modulus for steel is about 200 GPa, or 200e9 Pa. So let me confirm. Yes, steel's Young's modulus is approximately 200 GPa, which is 200,000,000,000 Pa.

So strain ε = σ / E = 179,666,666.67 Pa / 200,000,000,000 Pa.

Let me compute that. 179,666,666.67 / 200,000,000,000.

Hmm, let me write both in scientific notation. 179,666,666.67 is approximately 1.796666667e8. So 1.796666667e8 / 2e11.

That's (1.796666667 / 2) * 1e-3 = 0.8983333335 * 1e-3 = 8.983333335e-4.

So strain is approximately 0.0008983, or 0.08983% strain.

Now, the elongation. Elongation ΔL = ε * L, where L is the original length.

The rod is 2.0 m long. So ΔL = 0.0008983 * 2.0 m = 0.0017966 m, which is 1.7966 mm. So approximately 1.8 mm.

Looking back at the options, option I is 1.8. So the answer would be I: 1.8 mm.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. Because I might have made a mistake in the stress calculation.

Wait, another way to compute ΔL is using ΔL = (F * L) / (A * E). Let me try that.

F is 550 kg * 9.8 = 5390 N.

L is 2.0 m.

A is 0.30 cm² = 3e-5 m².

E is 200e9 Pa.

So ΔL = (5390 N * 2.0 m) / (3e-5 m² * 200e9 Pa) )

Compute numerator: 5390 * 2 = 10,780 N·m.

Denominator: 3e-5 * 2e11 = 3e-5 * 2e11 = 6e6.

So ΔL = 10,780 / 6e6 = 10,780 / 6,000,000.

Let me compute that: 10,780 ÷ 6,000,000 ≈ 0.001797 mm? Wait, no, wait, 10,780 divided by 6,000,000 is 0.001797 meters? No, wait, no, because the units: N·m is in the numerator, denominator is m²·Pa, which is N/m² * m², so units of Pa*m² = N/m² * m² = N/m, but wait, maybe I should focus on the numbers.

Wait, 10,780 divided by 6,000,000 equals approximately 0.001797 meters, which is 1.797 mm. So that's consistent with my earlier calculation of approximately 1.7966 mm. So around 1.8 mm.

So the elongation is about 1.8 mm. Looking at the options, option I is 1.8, so the correct answer is I.

To solve the problem, we calculate the stress, strain, and elongation of the steel rod under the given conditions.

### 1. **Stress Calculation**
Stress is given by the formula:

\[
\sigma = \frac{F}{A}
\]

- The force \( F \) is the weight of the milling machine:  
  \[
  F = m \cdot g = 550 \, \text{kg} \cdot 9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2 = 5390 \, \text{N}
  \]

- The cross-sectional area \( A \) is given as \( 0.30 \, \text{cm}^2 \). Converting to \( \text{m}^2 \):  
  \[
  A = 0.30 \, \text{cm}^2 = 0.30 \cdot (10^{-2} \, \text{m})^2 = 3 \cdot 10^{-5} \, \text{m}^2
  \]

- Substituting into the formula for stress:  
  \[
  \sigma = \frac{5390 \, \text{N}}{3 \cdot 10^{-5} \, \text{m}^2} = 179,666,666.67 \, \text{Pa} = 179.67 \, \text{MPa}
  \]

### 2. **Strain Calculation**
Strain is calculated using Hooke's Law:

\[
\varepsilon = \frac{\sigma}{E}
\]

- The Young's modulus \( E \) for steel is approximately \( 200 \, \text{GPa} = 200 \cdot 10^9 \, \text{Pa} \).

- Substituting the values:  
  \[
  \varepsilon = \frac{179,666,666.67 \, \text{Pa}}{200 \cdot 10^9 \, \text{Pa}} = 0.0008983
  \]

Thus, the strain is approximately \( 0.0008983 \) or \( 0.08983\% \).

### 3. **Elongation Calculation**
Elongation is given by:

\[
\Delta L = \varepsilon \cdot L
\]

- The original length of the rod is \( L = 2.0 \, \text{m} \).

- Substituting the values:  
  \[
  \Delta L = 0.0008983 \cdot 2.0 \, \text{m} = 0.0017966 \, \text{m} = 1.7966 \, \text{mm}
  \]

Thus, the elongation is approximately \( 1.8 \, \text{mm} \).

### Final Answer
The elongation of the rod is \( 1.8 \, \text{mm} \), which corresponds to option **I**.
