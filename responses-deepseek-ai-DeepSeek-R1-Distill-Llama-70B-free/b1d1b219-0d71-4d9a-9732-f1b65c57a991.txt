Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about how many people exercise regularly. The question is asking me to pick the correct option from A to J. Let me think this through step by step.

First, I need to understand the question properly. It says, "Current estimates of how many people exercise on a regular basis suggest that _____ do." So I'm supposed to fill in the blank with the correct percentage. The options are various percentages, some giving exact figures, others ranges.

I remember that exercise rates can vary a lot depending on the country, culture, and other factors. But the question is general, so it's probably referring to a global average or perhaps a specific country like the US, which is often a common context in such questions.

I think in many countries, especially developed ones, a significant portion of the population doesn't exercise regularly. I've heard statistics before that only a minority actually meet the recommended levels of physical activity. For example, I remember reading that in the US, less than half of adults meet the aerobic exercise guidelines, and even fewer meet the muscle-strengthening ones.

Wait, but some studies might say around 30-40% exercise regularly. So that would be less than 50%. Let me think. If the options include "less than 50%", that would be option J. But I should consider all options carefully.

Looking at the options again:
A: More than 90% → That seems too high. I don't think that many people exercise regularly.
B: Less than 10% → That seems too low. Maybe in some very inactive populations, but not the general estimate.
C: More than 50% → If it's more than half, that would mean a lot, but I'm not sure if that's accurate.
D: Less than 80% → Well, that's a broad range. It's probably true, but I'm looking for a more precise answer.
E: Exactly 50% → Unlikely, since exact figures are rare in such estimates.
F: More than 75% → That also seems high.
G: Less than 70% → This would include a lot of possibilities, but again, maybe not as precise.
H: Less than 25% → That might be too low unless in very specific circumstances.
I: More than 80% → Definitely too high.
J: Less than 50% → This seems plausible based on what I remember.

Wait, but some sources might say that about 30-40% of people exercise regularly. So that would be less than 50%, which would make option J correct. Alternatively, if it's around 45%, it's still less than 50%.

I'm trying to recall any specific data points. For instance, the World Health Organization (WHO) reports that about 31% of adults worldwide are physically inactive. But wait, does that mean they don't exercise at all? Or does it mean they don't meet the recommended levels?

Wait, maybe I'm mixing up inactivity with regular exercise. Because someone could be active but not meet the recommended levels. So if 31% are inactive, then the rest are active to some degree. But regular exercise might be a stricter measure.

Alternatively, in the US, the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) has reported that only about 23% of adults meet the guidelines for both aerobic and muscle-strengthening activities. So that's even lower, around 23%, which is less than 25% (option H). But that's if they meet both guidelines. If considering just any regular exercise, maybe it's higher.

Wait, but the question is about exercising on a regular basis, not necessarily meeting specific guidelines. So perhaps the number is higher than 23%. Maybe around 40-50% of people exercise regularly, but not necessarily meeting the full recommendations.

Hmm, this is getting a bit confusing. Let me try to think of other sources. I've heard that in many countries, less than half the population exercises regularly. For example, a survey might show that about 45% of people exercise a few times a week. That would still fall under "less than 50%", so option J.

Alternatively, if the estimate is that a majority don't exercise regularly, then "less than 50%" makes sense. So the correct answer would be J: Less than 50%.

Wait, but I'm a bit unsure because sometimes people might overreport their exercise habits in surveys. So actual numbers might be lower. But I think the general consensus is that less than half of the population exercises regularly.

So I'm leaning towards option J as the correct answer.

The question asks for the estimated percentage of people who exercise regularly. Based on various sources, including data from the WHO and CDC, it appears that less than 50% of the population exercises regularly. While some studies suggest around 30-40% of people exercise, this still falls under the "less than 50%" category. Therefore, the correct answer is:

J: Less than 50%

Answer: J
