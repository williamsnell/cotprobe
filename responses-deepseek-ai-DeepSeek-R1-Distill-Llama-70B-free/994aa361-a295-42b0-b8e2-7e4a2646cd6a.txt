Okay, so I've got this question here about computing the area of a triangle using Heron's formula. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me start by recalling what Heron's formula says.

From what I remember, Heron's formula allows you to find the area of a triangle when you know all three sides. The formula involves something called the semi-perimeter. Oh right, the semi-perimeter is half of the perimeter of the triangle. So first, I need to calculate that.

The semi-perimeter (s) is (a + b + c)/2, where a, b, c are the lengths of the sides. Once I have s, the area is the square root of s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c). That formula is a bit tricky, but I think that's right.

Looking at the question, it asks for statement functions. So I need to define two functions here. The first function S(A,B,C) should calculate the semi-perimeter. The second function AREA should compute the area using Heron's formula.

Let me look at the options. Each option has two parts: one for S and one for AREA. I'll go through them one by one.

Option A: S(A,B,C) is SQRT((A+B+C)/2). Wait, no. The semi-perimeter isn't the square root of anything. It's just (A+B+C)/2. So this S function is wrong because it's taking the square root. So A is incorrect.

Option B: S(A,B,C) is (A+B+C)/2. That's correct for the semi-perimeter. Then the AREA function is SQRT(X*(X+A)*(X+B)*(X+C)). Wait, that doesn't look right. Because in Heron's formula, it's s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c). So in this case, X is s, right? So the terms should be (X - A), (X - B), (X - C). But this option has (X+A), etc., which would be adding, not subtracting. That can't be right because s-a would be (s - a), not s + a. So B is wrong.

Option C: S(A,B,C) is (A+B+C). That's the perimeter, not the semi-perimeter. So S is wrong here. Therefore, C is incorrect.

Option D: S(A,B,C) is (A+B - C)/2. Hmm, that's not right either. The semi-perimeter is (A+B+C)/2. So D's S function is wrong. So D is out.

Option E: S(A,B,C) is (A² + B² + C²)/2. Wait, that's not the perimeter. That formula looks like it's from something else, maybe related to vectors or the Pythagorean theorem, but not for the semi-perimeter. So E's S is wrong.

Option F: S is 0.5*(A+B+C), which is correct. Then the AREA function is SQRT(X*(X-A)*(X-B)*(X-C)). That fits with Heron's formula because X is s, so s*(s-A)*(s-B)*(s-C) under the square root. So F looks correct so far. Let me check the other options just in case.

Option G: AREA is A*B*C. No, that's not Heron's formula. That's more like volume, but for a triangle, Heron's formula is different. So G is wrong.

Option H: S is (A+B+C)/3. That's not the semi-perimeter; that's more like an average. So H is incorrect.

Option I: S is correct, (A+B+C)/2. Then the AREA function is X divided by the product of (X-A), (X-B), (X-C). That doesn't fit Heron's formula at all. Heron's formula is the square root of the product, not a division. So I is wrong.

Option J: S is A+B+C, which is the perimeter, not the semi-perimeter. So J is incorrect.

So, the correct option is F. It correctly calculates the semi-perimeter as (A+B+C)/2 and then uses Heron's formula correctly in the AREA function with the square root of X*(X-A)*(X-B)*(X-C).
</think>

To compute the area of a triangle using Heron's formula, we first calculate the semi-perimeter \( S \), which is given by:

\[
S(A, B, C) = \frac{A + B + C}{2}
\]

Then, the area \( \text{AREA} \) is calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{AREA}(A, B, C, X) = \sqrt{X \cdot (X - A) \cdot (X - B) \cdot (X - C)}
\]

where \( X \) is the semi-perimeter \( S \). 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: The \( S \) function incorrectly includes a square root, so it is wrong.  
- **Option B**: The \( S \) function is correct, but the \( \text{AREA} \) function incorrectly adds \( A, B, C \) instead of subtracting them, so it is wrong.  
- **Option C**: The \( S \) function calculates the perimeter, not the semi-perimeter, so it is wrong.  
- **Option D**: The \( S \) function is incorrect, as it does not represent the semi-perimeter.  
- **Option E**: The \( S \) function is incorrect and unrelated to the semi-perimeter.  
- **Option F**: The \( S \) function is correct, and the \( \text{AREA} \) function matches Heron's formula, so this is correct.  
- **Option G**: The \( \text{AREA} \) function is incorrect, as it does not follow Heron's formula.  
- **Option H**: The \( S \) function is incorrect, as it calculates an average instead of the semi-perimeter.  
- **Option I**: The \( \text{AREA} \) function is incorrect, as it divides instead of taking the square root of the product.  
- **Option J**: The \( S \) function calculates the perimeter, not the semi-perimeter, so it is wrong.  

The correct answer is **F**, as it accurately implements Heron's formula.

Answer: F
