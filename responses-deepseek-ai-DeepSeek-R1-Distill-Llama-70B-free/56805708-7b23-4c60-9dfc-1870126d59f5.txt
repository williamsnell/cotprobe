Question:

A retiree owned a building in a city. Several years ago, an artist, in a signed writing, entered a three- year lease agreement with the retiree. The artist agreed to pay $800 monthly rent for the third-floor apartment in the retiree's building. The original three-year term had long since expired, but the artist has continued to pay his rent, and the retiree continued to accept it. The building became infested with rats after a restaurant was opened in the adjacent building. The artist could not tolerate the rats and served notice on the retiree that he was moving to another city and has not been heard from since. At common law, what remedy was available to the retiree before she accepted the first rental payment after the end of the initial three-year period?

Options:

A: Recovery of double the rent prorated on a monthly basis for the number of months the artist was on the premises beyond the three- year period.
B: Sue the artist for damages due to the infestation of rats.
C: Recovery of the difference between the lease price and the fair market value of the leasehold for a year.
D: Eviction of the artist for non-payment of rent.
E: Require that the artist move out immediately or be held responsible for three years' rent.
F: Seek a court order to compel the artist to continue the lease for another three years.
G: Require the artist to pay for the extermination of the rats.
H: Terminate the lease agreement without any further obligations.
I: Recovery of triple the rent prorated on a monthly basis for the number of months the artist was on the premises beyond the three- year period.

Okay, so I have this legal question here about landlord-tenant law, specifically at common law. Let me think through it step by step. 

The scenario is: A retiree owns a building and leased the third-floor apartment to an artist. The lease was for three years, and it's in writing, signed by both parties. The artist agreed to pay $800 a month. Now, the three-year term has expired, but the artist stayed on and continued paying rent, which the retiree accepted. Then, a problem arose with rats because a new restaurant opened next door. The artist couldn't handle the rats, so he gave notice that he's moving to another city and hasn't been heard from since.

The question is about what remedy was available to the retiree before she accepted the first rental payment after the initial three-year period. The options are from A to I.

First, I need to understand the legal situation here. The original lease was for three years, which has ended. But both parties continued the arrangementâ€”artist paid rent, and the retiree accepted it. So what kind of tenancy does this create?

Under common law, when a lease expires and the tenant continues to occupy the premises with the landlord's consent, it typically becomes a tenancy at will or a tenancy at sufferance. But wait, if the tenant continues to pay rent and the landlord accepts it, that usually creates a tenancy at will, which can be terminated by either party at any time. Alternatively, it might be a month-to-month tenancy, depending on the jurisdiction, but the general idea is that it's a periodic tenancy.

Wait, but the original lease was for three years, so when it expired, and the artist stayed on, paying month to month, that's probably a month-to-month tenancy under common law. Because the parties continued the arrangement, even without a new lease, the payment and acceptance of rent imply a new agreement, typically month-to-month.

Now, the question is about the remedy available to the retiree before she accepted the first payment after the three-year period. So before she accepted that first payment, what could she have done?

Wait, the initial lease ended, and the artist stayed. The retiree accepted rent after the lease ended. So when the lease ended, the artist became a month-to-month tenant. But the retiree had options at that point.

Wait, but the question is about before she accepted the first rental payment after the lease ended. So the lease was over, and the artist was still there. At that point, the retiree had two choices: either accept the rent, which would create a new month-to-month tenancy, or refuse to accept the rent and treat the artist as a tenant at sufferance, leading to eviction.

But the question is about the remedy available to the retiree before she accepted that first payment. So if she didn't accept the payment, she could have considered the lease ended and the artist as a holdover tenant. Alternatively, she could have accepted the payment, which would create a new tenancy.

Wait, but the question is about what she could do before accepting the first payment. So before she accepted the first rent after the lease expired, her options were to either accept the rent, thereby creating a month-to-month tenancy, or to refuse it and start eviction proceedings.

But the question is about the remedy available at that point. So if she didn't accept the rent, the artist would be a tenant at sufferance, and she could evict him. Alternatively, if she accepted the rent, they'd have a month-to-month tenancy, which either party could terminate with proper notice.

But the question is asking what remedy was available before she accepted the first rent. So she could have chosen not to accept the rent and instead terminate the tenancy.

Wait, but the options given don't directly address that. Let me look at the options again.

Option A: Recovery of double the rent prorated monthly beyond the three years.

Option B: Sue for damages due to rats.

Option C: Recovery of the difference between lease price and FMV for a year.

Option D: Eviction for non-payment.

Option E: Require artist to move out immediately or pay three years' rent.

Option F: Court order to compel the artist for another three years.

Option G: Artist pays for extermination.

Option H: Terminate lease without obligations.

Option I: Triple the rent prorated monthly beyond three years.

Hmm. The key here is that after the lease ended, the artist became a tenant at will or month-to-month. But before she accepted the rent, she could have considered the tenancy terminated and sought eviction.

Wait, but in common law, if a tenant holds over after the lease ends, the landlord can treat them as a tenant at sufferance and evict them, but if the landlord accepts rent, it's usually considered as consenting to a new tenancy.

So before accepting the first payment, the retiree could have chosen to not accept the rent and instead terminate the tenancy. If she didn't accept the rent, she could evict the artist as a holdover tenant.

Wait, but the question is about the remedy available before she accepted the first payment. So the options would include eviction, but I'm not sure.

Looking at the options, let me think.

Option E says require the artist to move out immediately or be held responsible for three years' rent. That doesn't sound right because the lease was only for three years, and it had already expired. So holding him for another three years would be a new lease, which he didn't agree to.

Option D: Eviction for non-payment. But the artist was paying, so that's not applicable.

Option H: Terminate the lease without further obligations. Well, the lease had already ended, so terminating it again might not make sense. But perhaps she could terminate the holdover tenancy.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that before accepting the rent, the landlord could have treated the tenant as holding over and sought eviction. Once she accepts the rent, a new tenancy is created.

So the remedy before accepting the rent would have been to evict the artist as a tenant at sufferance.

Looking at the options, option D is eviction for non-payment, but that's not the case here. The artist was paying, so that's not applicable.

Alternatively, is there an option about eviction without cause? Because at common law, a landlord can evict a month-to-month tenant without cause by giving proper notice.

Wait, but before she accepted the first payment, the artist was a tenant at sufferance. So she could have started eviction without accepting the rent.

But I don't see an option that directly states that. Let me re-examine the options.

Option E says require the artist to move out immediately or be held responsible for three years' rent. That sounds like it's about a new lease, but the original was three years, so maybe not.

Option H says terminate the lease without further obligations. But the lease had already ended, so perhaps this refers to terminating the holdover.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is E. Because when a tenant holds over, the landlord can either accept the holdover as a new tenancy (by accepting rent) or can elect to treat it as a tenancy at sufferance and evict. Alternatively, in some jurisdictions, if a tenant holds over, the landlord can elect to have the lease renewed for another term (e.g., another year if it was a yearly tenancy), but that's more under the option to renew, which isn't the case here.

Wait, the original lease was for three years, so if the tenant holds over, the landlord might have the option to consider it a new lease for another three years. But that's not common law; I think that's under some statutes or specific situations. At common law, a holdover after a fixed term usually leads to a tenancy at will or periodic tenancy.

Wait, but the problem says the lease was for three years, and after that, the artist continued to pay monthly, which the retiree accepted. So by accepting the rent, the landlord has created a month-to-month tenancy. But the question is about before she accepted the first payment. So before that point, the artist was a tenant at sufferance, and she could have evicted him without accepting the rent.

So the available remedy was to evict him because he was holding over without a new agreement. So looking at the options, which option allows her to evict him? Option D is eviction for non-payment, which is not the case here because he was paying. Option E says require him to move out immediately or be responsible for three years' rent. That seems like it's about a new lease, which isn't applicable here because the original lease had ended.

Wait, another angle: At common law, if a tenant holds over after the lease term, the landlord can choose to either:

1. Evict the tenant as a tenant at sufferance, or

2. Treat the tenant as a tenant for a new term, typically the same length as the original lease's term if the original was for a year or more. Wait, that's an important point. If the original lease was for a term longer than a year, then under common law, if the tenant holds over, the landlord can elect to have the lease renewed for another term of the same duration (three years in this case) or evict.

So in this case, the original lease was for three years, so if the tenant holds over, the landlord can choose to either:

- Evict the tenant (as a tenant at sufferance), or 

- Treat the holdover as a new lease for another three years.

So if the landlord doesn't want the tenant to stay, she can evict. But if she accepts rent, it might imply agreement to a new lease or a periodic tenancy.

So before she accepted the first payment, she could have chosen to require the artist to leave, or to hold him to a new three-year lease.

Wait, but the options don't have that. Let me look again.

Option E: Require the artist to move out immediately or be held responsible for three years' rent. That sounds like it's giving the choice: either move out or be liable for another three years. That aligns with the landlord's option to either evict or renew the lease for another term.

So if the tenant holds over, the landlord can choose to have them on a new three-year lease or evict them. So the remedy available would be to require the artist to either vacate or be bound for another three years.

So the correct answer would be E.

Wait, but another thought: At common law, after a lease for a term exceeding one year, a holdover could be treated as a renewal for the same term. So the landlord can hold the tenant to another three-year lease. Therefore, the landlord could require the artist to either leave or be bound for another three years, making the artist liable for the entire three years' rent if he refuses to stay.

So the correct remedy before accepting the rent would be option E: require the artist to move out immediately or be held responsible for three years' rent.

At common law, when a tenant holds over after the expiration of a lease, the landlord has two primary options: 

1. **Evict the tenant as a tenant at sufferance**, or  
2. **Treat the holdover as a renewal of the lease for another term of the same duration as the original lease** (in this case, three years). 

In this scenario, the original lease was for three years, and after its expiration, the artist continued to occupy the premises. Before the retiree accepted the first rental payment after the lease ended, she could have chosen to either evict the artist or require him to be bound by a new three-year lease. 

Option **E** aligns with this principle, as it reflects the landlord's ability to require the tenant to either vacate the premises immediately or remain liable for the full term of another three years. This remedy is consistent with the common law rule that a holdover after a lease term can be treated as a renewal for the same duration if the landlord so chooses.

The other options are incorrect because:  
- **A, C, I**: These involve calculations of rent or damages that are not directly relevant to the specific remedy available before accepting the first payment.  
- **B, G**: These pertain to issues related to the rat infestation, which are not the focus of the question.  
- **D**: Eviction for non-payment is inapplicable, as the artist was paying rent.  
- **F**: Compelling the artist to continue the lease for another three years is not a remedy the landlord can unilaterally impose without the tenant's agreement.  
- **H**: Terminating the lease without further obligations is misleading, as the lease had already expired, and the artist's holdover created a new legal situation.  

Thus, the correct answer is **E**, as it accurately reflects the landlord's remedy under common law before accepting the first rental payment after the lease expired.

Answer: E
