Okay, so I've got this statistics problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's see... The question is about the mass of chicken eggs, which are normally distributed. The mean is 45 grams, and the standard deviation is 4 grams. They're asking for the mass that would be the 25th percentile.

Hmm, right. Percentiles are points in a distribution where a certain percentage of observations fall below that point. So the 25th percentile means that 25% of the eggs are lighter than this mass, and 75% are heavier. Since it's a normal distribution, I can probably use the properties of the normal curve to solve this.

Wait, in a normal distribution, the mean is at the 50th percentile. So the 25th percentile should be to the left of the mean. That makes sense because lower values are on the left side of the bell curve.

I remember that percentiles can be found using z-scores. The z-score tells us how many standard deviations away from the mean a particular value is. For percentiles, we need the z-score corresponding to the 25th percentile.

Oh right, the z-score for the 25th percentile is a standard value. I think it's around -0.67. Wait, let me double-check that. Because the 50th percentile is a z of 0, and for 25%, it's the first quartile. Oh yeah, I think the z-score is approximately -0.6745. Sometimes it's rounded to -0.67 or -0.68.

So once I have the z-score, I can use the formula to find the corresponding x value. The formula is x = μ + z * σ. Here, μ is the mean (45g), z is the z-score, and σ is the standard deviation (4g).

Let me plug in the numbers. So x = 45 + (-0.6745)*4. Let's calculate that. 

First, multiply -0.6745 by 4. Hmm, 0.6745 *4 is about 2.698. So with the negative sign, it's -2.698. Now add that to 45. So 45 -2.698 equals 42.302 grams.

Wait, looking at the options, let's see. The options are A to J, with various decimals. Let me list them again:

A: 42.8 g  
B: 42.7 g  
C: 42.5 g  
D: 42.0 g  
E: 42.3 g  
F: 42.6 g  
G: 42.2 g  
H: 42.1 g  
I: 42.4 g  
J: 41.9 g  

I calculated 42.302 grams. So that's approximately 42.3 g. Looking at the options, option E is 42.3 g. So that should be the answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I'm not making any mistakes. Did I correctly find the z-score for the 25th percentile? Because sometimes people get confused between the lower and upper percentiles.

The z-score table for percentiles: for the 25th percentile, it's the value below which 25% of the data falls. So the z-score is indeed negative. Comparing to the standard normal distribution table, the closest z for 25% is about -0.6745. So that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects using a different method, like linear interpolation in the z-table? But I don't think that's necessary here because it's a standard percentile.

Alternatively, maybe I should use more precise z-scores. Let me check using a calculator or a more precise table. Oh, the exact z-score for 25th percentile is around -0.6745. So using that, x = 45 + (-0.6745)(4) = 45 - 2.698 = 42.302, which rounds to 42.3 g.

Looking back at the options, option E is 42.3, so that's matching.

Wait, but why are there so many options so close to each other? Like, 42.3 is option E, and others are nearby, like I is 42.4, G is 42.2. So my calculation must be precise.

Let me double-check the calculation. 0.6745 *4 is 2.698. So 45 minus 2.698 is 42.302, which is 42.302 grams. Rounded to one decimal place, that'd be 42.3. So yes, E is correct.

I think that's solid. So the answer should be E.

To determine the mass of the egg that corresponds to the 25th percentile, we start by recognizing that the masses are normally distributed with a mean (μ) of 45 g and a standard deviation (σ) of 4 g. The 25th percentile is the value below which 25% of the data falls, and in a normal distribution, this corresponds to a specific z-score.

The z-score for the 25th percentile is approximately **-0.6745**. Using the formula for converting a z-score to the corresponding value in the distribution:

\[
x = \mu + z \cdot \sigma
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
x = 45 + (-0.6745) \cdot 4
\]

First, calculate the product:

\[
-0.6745 \cdot 4 = -2.698
\]

Then, add this to the mean:

\[
x = 45 - 2.698 = 42.302 \, \text{g}
\]

Rounding to one decimal place, the value is **42.3 g**. Comparing this result to the provided options:

- **A: 42.8 g**
- **B: 42.7 g**
- **C: 42.5 g**
- **D: 42.0 g**
- **E: 42.3 g**
- **F: 42.6 g**
- **G: 42.2 g**
- **H: 42.1 g**
- **I: 42.4 g**
- **J: 41.9 g**

The closest match is **E: 42.3 g**. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**E**
