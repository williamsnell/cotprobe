Okay, so I've got this transformer problem in front of me. Hmm, let's see what I'm supposed to do here. The question is about calculating the efficiency of a transformer under a specific load condition. Right, efficiency for a full kVA, 0.8 power-factor load.

Wait, let me jot down what I know. The transformer is 2300 volts, 60 cycles. The parameters given are r1 = 1.28 ohms, r2 = 0.0467 ohms, x1 = 4.24 ohms, and x2 = 0.162 ohms. Then there are two test conditions: no-load and short-circuit.

No-load test: voltage impressed on the low-voltage winding is 2300 V, current In is 3.57 A, power Pn is 2140 watts. Short-circuit test: high-voltage winding is shorted, low-voltage has 48.4 V, current Isc is 132.6 A, power Psc is 1934 W. Both tests were done at 25°C, so the DC resistances are measured at that temperature.

Efficiency for a full kVA load at 0.8 PF. So I need to find the efficiency when the transformer is operating at full load with a power factor of 0.8.

Efficiency is usually calculated as (output power)/(input power) * 100%. But for transformers, we can also compute it using the formula: η = (kVA * 0.8 * V2²) / (kVA * 0.8 * V2² + W_total), where W_total is the total losses. Wait, but wait, maybe another approach is better here.

I remember that in transformers, the efficiency is highest when the variable (or copper) losses equal the core (iron) losses. But in this case, we're calculating at a specific load, so perhaps I should find the losses at that load.

Wait, but I think the standard approach for efficiency calculation is to determine the losses from the no-load and short-circuit tests.

So, no-load test gives us the core losses (iron losses). Because when there's no load, the current drawn is just the magnetizing current, and the power consumed is due to the core losses. So P_n (no-load power) is equal to the core losses, which is 2140 watts here. Hmm, wait, that seems high because 2140 watts is a lot for core loss. Wait, no, wait, no, the no-load power is P0 = V1 * I0 * cos(theta), but I think in the no-load condition, the current is very small, so the power is mainly the core loss. So, P0 is the core loss, which is 2140 W.

Then, the short-circuit test gives us the copper losses. Because when you short the secondary, the primary draws a current that's about equal to the full load current. The power measured in the short-circuit test is the copper loss in the windings. So Psc is the total copper loss at that current.

Wait, but wait, the short-circuit test is done at a lower voltage, 48.4 V, but the current is 132.6 A, so the power is 1934 W. So, the copper loss at that current is 1934 W.

But wait, that current is the full load current? Because when you short the secondary, the current should be the rated current, assuming the voltage applied is adjusted to allow that. Let me think: the transformer's rated current can be found from the short-circuit test. Because in the short-circuit test, the current is the rated current when the voltage is such that the impedance drop equals the applied voltage.

Wait, but perhaps I should find the rated current first. Let me think: the short-circuit test is done on the low-voltage side, with the high-voltage side shorted. So the current Isc is 132.6 A, which should be the rated current of the high-voltage side, because when the secondary is shorted, the primary draws the full load current.

Wait, no, wait. The transformer is a 2300-volt unit, but I'm not sure which side is which. Wait, the problem says when the high-voltage winding is shorted, and 48.4 volts are impressed on the low-voltage winding. So which side is which? Let me clarify.

Wait, the problem says that in the no-load test, 2300 volts are impressed on the low-voltage winding. So, that would imply that the low-voltage (primary?) is being excited, and the high-voltage (secondary) is open.

Wait, but typically, the low-voltage is the primary. So when the high-voltage is shorted, the low-voltage is the primary. So during the short-circuit test, the primary (low-voltage) is connected to 48.4 V, and the secondary (high-voltage) is shorted, leading to a current of 132.6 A.

Wait, but in that case, 48.4 V is applied to the primary (low-voltage side) to cause full-load current in the secondary. But wait, the current in the primary during the short-circuit test would be related to the turns ratio.

Hmm, perhaps I should calculate the turns ratio first.

Turns ratio a is N1/N2. Since the transformer's voltage rating is 2300 volts on one side, but I'm not sure which is primary and secondary. Wait, the no-load test is done with 2300 volts on the low-voltage winding, so the low-voltage winding must be the primary. So N1 is the low-voltage winding, N2 the high-voltage. So the turns ratio a = N1/N2 = V1/V2. Wait, no, actually, a is usually defined as V1/V2, but if V1 is the primary, then a would be N1/N2.

Wait, perhaps I'm complicating things. Let me think: in the short-circuit test, the primary is connected to 48.4 V, and the secondary is shorted. The current is 132.6 A in the primary, or is it in the secondary? Wait, when the secondary is shorted, the current in the primary is the same as the current in the secondary, because the same current flows through both windings, considering ideal transformer. So, in the short-circuit test, the current in the primary is Isc = 132.6 A, and the secondary current is the same as the primary, but perhaps scaled by the turns ratio? No, wait, the current ratio is inverse of the turns ratio.

Wait, let me clarify. The primary is the low-voltage side, so when the secondary is shorted, the primary current is Isc = 132.6 A. So the primary current is 132.6 A, which would correspond to the secondary current being a * Isc, where a is N1/N2. Because in an ideal transformer, I2 = I1 * (N1/N2). So, the secondary current would be a * I1. But I don't know a yet.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the turns ratio a. Since the no-load test is done with V1 = 2300 V on the primary (low-voltage), and the secondary is open. So the voltage on the secondary would be V2 = a * V1, where a = N2/N1. Wait, no, the turns ratio a is usually defined as a = V2/V1 = N2/N1. So, if V1 is 2300 V, and the transformer's secondary is high voltage, but we don't have the V2 value. Hmm, that's a problem. Wait, perhaps the transformer's rated voltage on the secondary (high voltage) is 2300 V? Or is the 2300 V on the low-voltage side?

Wait, the question says it's a 2300-volt 60-cycle power transformer. The no-load test is with 2300 volts on the low-voltage winding. So the low-voltage (primary) is 2300 V, and the high-voltage (secondary) would be higher? Or is 2300 V the primary, and the secondary is higher. Hmm, but without knowing the secondary voltage, I'm a bit stuck. Wait, perhaps I can find the secondary voltage from the short-circuit test.

Wait, no, perhaps I don't need to. Let me think about what I'm trying to find. The efficiency at full kVA load, 0.8 PF. So perhaps I can find the full load kVA, but wait, I don't know the secondary voltage, so maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the rated current on the secondary. Because the short-circuit test gives me the full load current on the primary. Let me think: in the short-circuit test, the primary is connected to a voltage Vsc, which is 48.4 V, and the current is Isc = 132.6 A. So this current is the primary's full load current? Because when the secondary is shorted, the primary current is at its maximum, which would be the rated current.

So, assuming that 132.6 A is the rated current of the primary (low-voltage side), then the primary's rated current is 132.6 A. The primary's rated voltage is 2300 V, so the rated kVA would be V1 * I1 = 2300 V * 132.6 A. Let me calculate that: 2300 * 132.6 = let's see, 2300 * 100 is 230,000, 2300*30=69,000, 2300*2.6=5,980. So total is 230,000 + 69,000 = 299,000 + 5,980 = 304,980 VA. So 304.98 kVA. So, the transformer is rated for approximately 305 kVA. Hmm, but the question says "for a full kVA load", so perhaps the full load is 1 kVA, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I read it wrong. Oh, wait, the question says "a full kVA, 0.8 power-factor load", so perhaps it's a load of 1 kVA, but that seems too small. Or perhaps the transformer's full load is 1 kVA? But no, that can't be right because earlier calculations show it's about 305 kVA.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me think again. The short-circuit test yields the full load current, which is 132.6 A on the primary. So the primary's full load current is 132.6 A. The primary voltage is 2300 V, so the VA rating is 2300 * 132.6 = 304,980 VA or 304.98 kVA. So the transformer is rated for about 305 kVA.

The question is about the efficiency at full kVA load, so 305 kVA, 0.8 PF. So I need to calculate the efficiency at that load.

Efficiency η is given by (output power)/(input power). Output power is the load power, which is kVA * PF. So 305 kVA * 0.8 = 244 kW. The input power is the output power plus the losses. The losses consist of the core loss (Pcore) and the copper loss (Pcu).

The core loss Pcore is the no-load power, which is given as 2140 W. So that's 2.14 kW.

The copper loss at full load is determined from the short-circuit test. The short-circuit test's power is 1934 W, which is the copper loss when the current is 132.6 A. Wait, but is that the copper loss at full load? Because in the short-circuit test, the current is the full load current, so the copper loss is I² R, where R is the equivalent resistance. So if the total copper loss at full load is 1934 W, then at full load, Pcu = 1934 W.

Wait, but wait, the short-circuit test measures the copper losses in both windings. So Psc = I1² R1 + I2² R2. But I1 is the primary current, I2 is the secondary current. But since it's a short circuit, the impedance is the main factor. Alternatively, sometimes the short-circuit test gives the total copper loss as Psc = I1² (R1 + a² R2), where a is the turns ratio. But perhaps I'm overcomplicating.

Wait, let's think differently. The short-circuit test gives the copper losses at the test current. So the copper loss at full load current is Psc = 1934 W. So in the short-circuit test, the current is 132.6 A, which is the full load current. So the copper loss at full load is 1934 W. So that's 1.934 kW.

Wait, but wait, Psc is 1934 W, but that's the power input during the short-circuit test. That power is equal to the copper losses in both windings. So Psc = Pcu_primary + Pcu_secondary = I1² R1 + I2² R2.

But since the transformer is under short circuit, I2 = I1 * a, where a is the turns ratio. So I2 = a * I1.

Alternatively, the equivalent resistance referred to the primary is R_eq = R1 + a² R2, so Psc = I1² R_eq.

But perhaps I don't need to go into that because the problem gives Psc directly as 1934 W, which is the total copper loss at 132.6 A. So, at full load current (132.6 A), the copper loss is 1934 W.

So the total losses at full load would be Pcore + Pcu = 2140 W + 1934 W = 4074 W, which is 4.074 kW.

The output power is 305 kVA * 0.8 = 244 kW.

The input power is output + losses = 244 kW + 4.074 kW = 248.074 kW.

So efficiency η = (244 / 248.074) * 100%.

Let me compute that. 244 / 248.074 ≈ 0.9835, so 98.35%.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options given. Let me check the options again. The options are A:97.8, B:99.5, C:96.7, D:95.0, E:95.5, F:99.1, G:94.8, H:97.3, I:93.2, J:98.2.

Hmm, 98.35 is closest to option J:98.2 or F:99.1, but perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation.

Wait, maybe I miscalculated the output and input power.

Wait, let me double-check. The output power is 305 kVA * 0.8 PF = 244 kW. Correct.

The losses: Pcore = 2140 W = 2.14 kW. Pcu = 1934 W = 1.934 kW. So total losses 2.14 + 1.934 = 4.074 kW.

Input power is 244 + 4.074 = 248.074 kW.

Efficiency is (244 / 248.074) *100 = approx 98.35%.

Looking at the options, J is 98.2%, which is close but not exact. So perhaps I made a mistake in assuming that the Psc is the copper loss at full load. Let me think again.

Wait, the Psc is the power measured during the short-circuit test, which is at a lower voltage than the rated voltage. So maybe the current during the test is not the full load current.

Wait, wait, when you perform a short-circuit test, the voltage applied is lower than the rated voltage, but the current that flows is the full load current. So in this case, the short-circuit test was done at 48.4 V on the primary, and the current was 132.6 A, which is the full load current. So the copper loss is indeed 1934 W at full load.

Wait, but perhaps I'm supposed to calculate the copper loss using the short-circuit data in a different way. Let's think about the short-circuit test.

In the short-circuit test, the power input is equal to the copper losses, assuming that the core loss is negligible because the voltage is low. So, Psc = I1² R1 + I2² R2. But R1 and R2 are given. Wait, the problem gives us r1 and r2, which are DC resistances.

Wait, but in the short-circuit test, the AC resistance would be a bit higher than DC due to the skin effect, but the problem states that the temperature during the test is 25°C, same as when the DC resistances were measured. So perhaps we can assume that the AC resistances are approximately equal to the DC resistances at that temperature.

So, perhaps the copper losses can also be calculated using the formula Pcu = I1² R1 + I2² R2, which should equal Psc. Let me check that.

Given that during the short-circuit test, I1 = 132.6 A.

R1 is 1.28 ohms, so I1² R1 = (132.6)^2 * 1.28.

Wait, let's compute that:

132.6 squared: 132^2 is 17,424, plus 0.6^2 which is 0.36, and 2*132*0.6=158.4, so total 17,424 + 158.4 + 0.36 = 17,582.76.

So 17,582.76 * 1.28 = let's compute:

17,582.76 * 1 = 17,582.76
17,582.76 * 0.28 = approx 4,923.17
Total = 22,505.93 W, which is 22.506 kW.

That's way higher than the Psc of 1,934 W. So I must have done something wrong here.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because if I compute the copper loss as I1² (R1 + a² R2), where a is the turns ratio, but I don't know a yet.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the turns ratio first. Because during the no-load test, the voltage on the low-voltage (primary) is 2300 V, and the secondary is open. So the induced voltage in the secondary would be V2 = a * V1, where a = N2/N1. But since the secondary is open, we don't measure V2, but in the short-circuit test, we can find a.

Wait, in the short-circuit test, the primary is connected to
