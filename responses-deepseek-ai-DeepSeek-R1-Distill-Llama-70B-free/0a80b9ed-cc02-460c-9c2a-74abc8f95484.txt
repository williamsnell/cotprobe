Options:

Okay, so I have this question about a slippery-slope argument and when it's considered fallacious. Hmm, I remember that a slippery-slope argument is a type of logical fallacy where someone suggests that a relatively small first step will lead to a chain of related events culminating in some significant effect. The fallacy occurs when the chain of events isn't actually supported by evidence or when the probability of each step is not established.

The question is asking under what condition this type of argument is fallacious. The options are from A to J. Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A says there's good reason to think that one action leads to another undesirable action. Wait, if there's a good reason, then the argument might not be fallacious. Because a valid slippery-slope argument would have a logical connection. So maybe A isn't the correct answer.

Option B: based on logical progression. If it's logical, then it's not fallacious. So B probably isn't the answer.

Option C: more than two possible results. I'm not sure. The number of possible results might not directly determine if it's fallacious. It's more about the justification of the chain.

Option D: based on cause and effect. That sounds similar to a logical progression. If each effect leads to the next cause, maybe it's not fallacious. So D might not be the right choice.

Option E: grounded in established facts. If it's based on facts, then the argument is stronger and not fallacious. So E isn't the answer.

Option F: based on a hypothetical situation. Slippery-slope often uses hypotheticals, but that alone doesn't make it fallacious. It's the lack of evidence that's the problem.

Option G: no good reason to think the action leads to another undesirable action. Oh, this sounds right. If there's no good reason, the argument is fallacious because it's just scaremongering without basis.

Option H: only two possible results. I don't think the number of results determines fallaciousness. It's more about the evidence supporting the link.

Option I: significant evidence supports the pattern. If there's evidence, then the argument isn't fallacious. So I isn't the answer.

Option J: it's hypothetical. Similar to F, being hypothetical doesn't automatically make it fallacious. It's the lack of justification that matters.

Putting it all together, the slippery-slope is fallacious when there's no good reason to believe the first action leads to the bad outcome. So the correct answer is G.

The slippery-slope argument is fallacious when there is no good reason to believe that one action will inevitably lead to another undesirable action. This lack of justification makes the argument a fallacy, as it relies on unfounded fears rather than evidence or logical connections.

Answer: G
