Question:

Suppose the market price for corn drops from $1,00per bushel to $.75 per bushel. In reaction to this, the farmers decide to sell one third less corn to the market. Has the supply of corn to the market decrease?

Options:

A: The supply of corn to the market has increased.
B: No, the supply of corn to the market has not decreased.
C: Yes, the supply of corn to the market has decreased.
D: The supply of corn to the market remained the same.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this economics question about supply. Let me read it again carefully. The question says that the market price of corn drops from $1.00 per bushel to $0.75 per bushel. In response, farmers decide to sell one third less corn to the market. The question is asking whether the supply of corn to the market has decreased.

Hmm, I remember that supply refers to the quantity of a good that producers are willing and able to sell at a given price level. But wait, isn't supply more about the relationship between price and quantity supplied, as shown by the supply curve?

So, when the price drops, what happens? Normally, according to the law of supply, if the price of a good decreases, the quantity supplied decreases because producers are less incentivized to produce as much. But wait, in this question, the price change is causing the farmers to sell less. So their quantity supplied is decreasing.

Wait, but the question is about whether the supply has decreased. Or is it about the quantity supplied? Because sometimes people confuse supply and quantity supplied. Supply is the whole schedule, while quantity supplied is the specific amount at a certain price.

So when the price drops, the quantity supplied decreases along the supply curve. But the supply curve itself (the function) doesn't shift unless other factors change, like production costs, technology, or expectations. In this case, the change is in the price causing a movement along the curve, not a shift.

Wait, but the question says the farmers decide to sell a third less. So maybe they're reducing the quantity they bring to the market. So if they were selling, say, 300 bushels before, now they're selling 200. That's a decrease in quantity supplied.

But the question is about whether the supply has decreased. So is this a shift of the supply curve, or just a movement along it? Because if the supply curve shifts, that would mean the supply has changed. But if they're just selling less because the price dropped, that's a movement along the existing supply curve.

So the supply itself (the curve) hasn't changed. It's just that at the lower price, less is supplied. So the quantity supplied has decreased, but the supply hasn't.

Wait, but the way the question is phrased: "Has the supply of corn to the market decreased?" So if the farmers are selling one third less, meaning they're bringing less to market, isn't that a decrease in quantity supplied, not supply.

So the correct answer would be that the quantity supplied has decreased, but the supply (the curve) hasn't. So the supply hasn't decreased.

Looking at the options: Option B says "No, the supply has not decreased." Option C says yes. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but some might confuse this. Because when the price drops, the quantity supplied decreases, but supply is about the whole relationship. So the supply curve remains the same; only the quantity has changed.

Yes, so the supply hasn't decreased; the quantity supplied has. So the correct answer is B: No, the supply has not decreased.

The question examines the distinction between supply and quantity supplied. Supply refers to the entire schedule of quantities producers are willing to sell at various prices, while quantity supplied is the specific amount sold at a given price. When the price of corn drops, farmers sell one third less, indicating a decrease in quantity supplied. However, this change represents a movement along the existing supply curve, not a shift in the supply curve itself. Since the supply curve remains unchanged, the supply of corn has not decreased.

Answer: B
