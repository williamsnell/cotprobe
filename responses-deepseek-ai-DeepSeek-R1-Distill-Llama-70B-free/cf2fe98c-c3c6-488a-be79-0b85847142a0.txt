Okay, so I've got this question about linear algebra, specifically dealing with linear independence and the dimension of a vector space. I'm a bit rusty on these concepts, but let me try to work through it step by step.

The question has two statements, and I need to determine if each is true or false. Then, based on that, select the correct option from A to J.

Let me start by recalling some key concepts. 

First, linear independence. A set of vectors is linearly independent if none of them can be written as a linear combination of the others. In R², if I have two vectors, they are linearly independent if they are not scalar multiples of each other. But wait, the statement says "any set of two vectors in R² is linearly independent." That doesn't sound right. Because if I have two vectors that are parallel (like one is a scalar multiple of the other), then they would be linearly dependent. So for example, if I have vectors (1,0) and (2,0), these are clearly on the same line, so they're dependent. So statement 1 is false. 

Now, moving on to statement 2: If V is the span of vectors v1 through vk, and the set {v1,...,vk} is linearly independent, then the dimension of V is k. Hmm. I remember that the dimension of a vector space is the maximum number of linearly independent vectors in that space. Also, the span of these vectors is the space they generate. So if I have k vectors that are linearly independent, then they form a basis for their span. And the number of vectors in a basis is the dimension. So yes, in this case, dim(V) should be k. So statement 2 is true.

Putting it together: Statement 1 is false, statement 2 is true. Looking at the options, option C is False, True. So the answer should be C.

Statement 1 claims that any set of two vectors in \( \mathbb{R}^2 \) is linearly independent. This is false because if the two vectors are scalar multiples of each other (i.e., parallel), they are linearly dependent. 

Statement 2 asserts that if \( V = \text{span}(v_1, \dots, v_k) \) and \( \{v_1, \dots, v_k\} \) is linearly independent, then \( \dim(V) = k \). This is true because a set of linearly independent vectors spanning a space forms a basis, and the number of basis vectors equals the dimension of the space.

Thus, Statement 1 is false, and Statement 2 is true. The correct option is:

C: False, True

Answer: C
