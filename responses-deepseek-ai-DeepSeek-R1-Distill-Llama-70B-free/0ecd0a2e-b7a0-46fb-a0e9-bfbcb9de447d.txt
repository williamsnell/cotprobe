Question:

One of the most frequent findings of studies on human beings with “split brains” is that

Options:

A: The right hemisphere is predominantly concerned with verbal information
B: The right hemisphere is predominantly concerned with numeric information
C: aside from the long-known localization of speech functions, the two hemispheres appear to be essentially equivalent as information processors
D: certain kinds of visuospatial tasks are performed beer by the right hemisphere than by the left
E: The two hemispheres appear to have a competitive relationship in information processing
F: the right hemisphere provides backup for the left in some tasks but excels the left in none
G: The left hemisphere is predominantly concerned with handling the body's motor skills
H: The left hemisphere provides backup for the right in some tasks but excels the right in none
I: The left hemisphere predominantly handles emotional processing
J: Both hemispheres are specialized in processing musical information

Okay, I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about split-brain studies. Hmm, I remember from my psychology class that split-brain refers to individuals who have had their corpus callosum severed, which is the main connection between the two hemispheres of the brain. This procedure is usually done to treat severe epilepsy.

So the question is asking about one of the most frequent findings from these studies. The options are from A to J, and I need to pick the correct one.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A says the right hemisphere handles verbal information. Wait, no, I think it's the opposite. The left hemisphere is usually specialized for language and verbal tasks. So A is probably wrong.

Option B claims the right hemisphere is for numeric info. Again, I thought the left handles numbers as part of its language and logic processing, so B might not be right either.

Option C suggests that aside from speech, both hemispheres are equivalent. I don't think that's correct because split-brain studies showed distinct specializations beyond just speech. So C is likely incorrect.

Option D states that the right hemisphere is better at visuospatial tasks. That rings a bell. I remember that the right hemisphere is more involved in spatial abilities, like recognizing faces or understanding spatial relationships. So D sounds right, but I'll keep going through the options to be sure.

Option E says the hemispheres have a competitive relationship. I'm not sure about this. I think they usually work together, but in split-brain patients, they can't communicate, leading to some conflicts in behavior, like the famous cases where a patient's hands act independently. But is this a frequent finding? Maybe, but I'm not certain.

Option F claims the right hemisphere only provides backup and doesn't excel. That doesn't sound right because studies show each hemisphere has its strengths. So F is probably wrong.

Option G says the left handles motor skills. Wait, no, motor skills are usually controlled by the opposite hemisphere. Like, the left hemisphere controls the right side of the body and vice versa. But handling motor skills in general—maybe it's more about coordination. I'm a bit fuzzy on this point.

Option H suggests the left provides backup but doesn't excel. That doesn't seem right because the left is known for language and other functions.

Option I says the left handles emotional processing. No, I think the right hemisphere is more involved in emotions and emotional processing. So I is incorrect.

Option J claims both hemispheres are specialized in music. I'm not too sure, but I think the right hemisphere is more involved in processing music, so J might not be correct.

So, going back, the most frequent finding is that each hemisphere has specialized functions. The left is for language, logic, and the right for spatial and visual tasks. So the question is about what's frequently found. I remember Roger Sperry's work showing that when the hemispheres are separated, each can handle different types of information without the other knowing. So for visuospatial tasks, the right hemisphere is better, which aligns with option D.

Wait, but what about option E? Some studies show competition, but is that the most frequent finding? I think the main finding is the specialization, not competition. So I think D is the correct answer.

The most frequent finding from studies on individuals with "split brains" is that the two hemispheres of the brain have distinct specialized functions. The left hemisphere is primarily responsible for language, verbal information, and logical processing, while the right hemisphere excels in visuospatial tasks, such as recognizing faces and understanding spatial relationships. This specialization was a key discovery in the work of researchers like Roger Sperry, who demonstrated that when the hemispheres are disconnected, each can process certain types of information independently.

Analyzing the options:

- **A, B, C, F, G, H, I, J**: These options are incorrect because they either misattribute functions (e.g., verbal or numeric processing to the right hemisphere) or oversimplify the hemispheres' roles.
- **D**: Correct. The right hemisphere's superiority in visuospatial tasks is a well-documented finding.
- **E**: While hemispheric competition can occur in split-brain patients, it is not the most frequent or primary finding.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**D: Certain kinds of visuospatial tasks are performed better by the right hemisphere than by the left.**

Answer: D
