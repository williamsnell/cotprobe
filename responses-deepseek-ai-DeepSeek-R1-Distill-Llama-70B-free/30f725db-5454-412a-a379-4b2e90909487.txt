Okay, so I have this question about the metabolic fates of alpha-D-glucose, right? And I'm supposed to figure out which process is more efficient based on the standard free energy changes. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my biochemistry, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, the two reactions given are:

Reaction (a): alpha-D-glucose → 2 ethanol + 2 CO2
Reaction (b): 6 O2 + alpha-D-glucose → 6 CO2 + 6 H2O

I remember that the standard free energy change (ΔG°) tells us about the spontaneity and efficiency of a reaction. A more negative ΔG° means the reaction is more spontaneous and, in this context, probably more efficient in terms of energy utilization.

The problem gives me the ΔG°f (standard free energy of formation) for each compound. I think ΔG°f is the change when a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states. So for each reaction, I need to calculate the overall ΔG° by using these values.

Let me jot down the given data:

ΔG°f (kcal/mol):
- CO2(g): -94.26
- H2O(l): -56.69
- Ethanol (1M): -43.39
- α-D-glucose: -219.22

Wait, I think the formula is ΔG° reaction = sum (ΔG°f products) - sum (ΔG°f reactants). But wait, I have to remember the stoichiometric coefficients.

For reaction (a):
Products are 2 ethanol and 2 CO2. Reactants are 1 glucose.
So ΔG°a = [2*(ΔG°f ethanol) + 2*(ΔG°f CO2)] - [1*(ΔG°f glucose)].

Plugging in the numbers:
ΔG°a = [2*(-43.39) + 2*(-94.26)] - (-219.22)
Let me calculate each part.

2*(-43.39) = -86.78
2*(-94.26) = -188.52
So products sum to (-86.78) + (-188.52) = -275.3

Then subtract the reactants: -275.3 - (-219.22) = -275.3 + 219.22 = -56.08 kcal/mol.

Wait, wait! Because ΔG°f for glucose is -219.22. So when you subtract the reactants, which is just glucose, it's - (1 * -219.22) = +219.22.

Wait, no, the formula is sum(products) - sum(reactants). So:

sum(products) = 2*(-43.39) + 2*(-94.26) = (-86.78) + (-188.52) = -275.3
sum(reactants) = 1*(-219.22) = -219.22
ΔG°a = (-275.3) - (-219.22) = -275.3 + 219.22 = -56.08 kcal/mol.

Wait, that gives ΔG°a as -56.08 kcal/mol. Oh, but wait, because I think I might have made a mistake with the signs. Because the standard free energy of formation is for each compound from elements. So when a reaction uses a compound, it's the reverse of formation. Hmm.

Wait, no, the standard approach is correct. For ΔG° reaction, it's sum of products' ΔG°f minus sum of reactants' ΔG°f. So for reaction (a), it's correct as done.

Now reaction (b):

6 O2 + glucose → 6 CO2 + 6 H2O

So the products are 6 CO2 and 6 H2O. Reactants are 6 O2 and 1 glucose.

ΔG°b = [6*(ΔG°f CO2) + 6*(ΔG°f H2O)] - [6*(ΔG°f O2) + 1*(ΔG°f glucose)]

But wait, what's the ΔG°f of O2? I think O2 is an element in its standard state, so ΔG°f is zero.

So ΔG°b = [6*(-94.26) + 6*(-56.69)] - [0 + (-219.22)]

Calculating each part:

6*(-94.26) = -565.56
6*(-56.69) = -340.14
Sum products: -565.56 -340.14 = -905.7

Sum reactants: 0 + (-219.22) = -219.22

ΔG°b = (-905.7) - (-219.22) = -905.7 + 219.22 = -686.48 kcal/mol.

Wait, that's a big number. So reaction (b) has a ΔG° of -686.48, and reaction (a) is -56.08.

But wait, wait, the question is about which process is more efficient. Efficiency in terms of energy utilization would relate to how much energy is released, I think. Because a more negative ΔG° means more energy is released, so the cell can utilize that energy more.

So reaction (b) releases a lot more energy than reaction (a). So reaction (b) is more efficient. That's probably the correct answer.

So the options are:

A: Neither is efficient.

B: Reaction (a)

C: Both equal.

D: Reaction (b)

So the correct choice is D.

To determine which process represents the more efficient utilization of α-D-glucose, we calculate the standard free energy change (ΔG°) for each reaction using the formula:

\[
\Delta G^\circ_{\text{reaction}} = \sum \Delta G^\circ_f (\text{products}) - \sum \Delta G^\circ_f (\text{reactants})
\]

### Reaction (a):  
\[
\alpha\text{-D-glucose} \rightarrow 2 \text{ethanol} + 2 \text{CO}_2  
\]

Using the given data:  
- ΔG°f (ethanol) = -43.39 kcal/mol  
- ΔG°f (CO₂) = -94.26 kcal/mol  
- ΔG°f (α-D-glucose) = -219.22 kcal/mol  

\[
\Delta G^\circ_a = [2(-43.39) + 2(-94.26)] - [1(-219.22)]
\]
\[
\Delta G^\circ_a = [-86.78 - 188.52] - [-219.22]  
\]
\[
\Delta G^\circ_a = -275.3 + 219.22 = -56.08 \, \text{kcal/mol}
\]

### Reaction (b):  
\[
6 \text{O}_2 + \alpha\text{-D-glucose} \rightarrow 6 \text{CO}_2 + 6 \text{H}_2\text{O}  
\]

Using the given data:  
- ΔG°f (CO₂) = -94.26 kcal/mol  
- ΔG°f (H₂O) = -56.69 kcal/mol  
- ΔG°f (O₂) = 0 kcal/mol (element in standard state)  
- ΔG°f (α-D-glucose) = -219.22 kcal/mol  

\[
\Delta G^\circ_b = [6(-94.26) + 6(-56.69)] - [6(0) + 1(-219.22)]
\]
\[
\Delta G^\circ_b = [-565.56 - 340.14] - [-219.22]  
\]
\[
\Delta G^\circ_b = -905.7 + 219.22 = -686.48 \, \text{kcal/mol}
\]

### Comparison:  
- Reaction (a) has a ΔG° of -56.08 kcal/mol.  
- Reaction (b) has a ΔG° of -686.48 kcal/mol.  

A more negative ΔG° indicates a more spontaneous and energy-efficient reaction. Since reaction (b) releases significantly more energy than reaction (a), it represents the more efficient utilization of α-D-glucose.

### Evaluation of Options:  
- **A:** Incorrect. Both reactions are efficient, but one is more so than the other.  
- **B:** Incorrect. Reaction (a) is less efficient than reaction (b).  
- **C:** Incorrect. The reactions are not equally efficient.  
- **D:** Correct. Reaction (b) is more efficient.
