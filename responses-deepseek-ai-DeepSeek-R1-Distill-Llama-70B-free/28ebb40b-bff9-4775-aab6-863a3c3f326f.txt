Okay, so I've got this question about Baxter and his environmental claims. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to break it down.

The question says that Baxter has a "very general way" of stating what we should strive for environmentally, and it's asking what assumption underlies that approach. The options are A through J, and I need to pick the correct one.

First, I remember that Baxter is associated with some sort of environmental philosophy. Wait, wasn't he a legal scholar who wrote about environmental ethics? Oh right, William Baxter, maybe from a reading in environmental law or ethics. I think his approach was quite anthropocentric, meaning human-centered.

So, if Baxter's approach is anthropocentric, that suggests that humans are the central consideration. That would mean that environmental policies should focus on human satisfaction and well-being. So, looking at the options, let's go through them.

Option A: We have unlimited resources. That doesn't sound right. I don't think Baxter would assume that; in fact, environmental issues often stem from limited resources.

Option B: Human satisfaction is the only measure of environmental success. This seems to align with what I was thinking. If it's anthropocentric, then yes, human satisfaction would be the main or only measure.

Option C: We can measure incremental units of human satisfaction. That sounds a bit more specific. I'm not sure if Baxter's approach requires precise measurement or just that human satisfaction is the goal. Maybe this isn't the assumption.

Option D: Precisely predict environmental impacts. That seems too strong. I don't think any approach assumes we can predict everything precisely.

Option E: Environment is solely a human construct. I'm not sure. Baxter's view is human-centered, but does that mean the environment exists only as a human concept? That might be more of a social construct theory, not necessarily Baxter's.

Option F: All living organisms have equal value. No, that's more of a biocentric or ecocentric view, which would contrast with Baxter's anthropocentrism.

Option G: All of the above. No way, because some options don't fit.

Option H: God-like control over the environment. That sounds like the "control of nature" idea, but I don't think Baxter's assumption is about control but rather about prioritizing humans.

Option I: Nonhuman animals have no value. That's too extreme. Anthropocentric doesn't mean other species have no value; it's just that humans are the primary consideration.

Option J: Preservation is governments' sole responsibility. I don't think Baxter's approach is about who is responsible, but rather the goal.

So, putting it together, the assumption would be that human satisfaction is the only measure. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but option C is about measuring satisfaction. If his approach is very general, maybe he doesn't get into specifics of measurement. So B is about the measure being human satisfaction, which fits better than C.

The question revolves around Baxter's "very general way" of stating environmental goals and the assumptions underlying it. Baxter, known for an anthropocentric approach, prioritizes human satisfaction and well-being as the central focus. This means environmental success is measured by human satisfaction. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A** assumes unlimited resources, which isn't plausible.
- **B** aligns with anthropocentrism, focusing solely on human satisfaction.
- **C** suggests measurability, which may be too specific for Baxter's general approach.
- **D** implies precise predictions, which is unrealistic.
- **E** suggests the environment is solely a human construct, not necessarily Baxter's view.
- **F** promotes equal value for all organisms, contradicting anthropocentrism.
- **G** is incorrect as not all options fit.
- **H** implies god-like control, not Baxter's focus.
- **I** is too extreme, as anthropocentrism doesn't negate other species' value entirely.
- **J** focuses on responsibility, not the goal.

Thus, the correct assumption is that human satisfaction is the only measure of success.

Answer: B
