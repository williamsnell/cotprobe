Okay, so I've got this problem here about calculating the effective rate for 18% compounded quarterly. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my finance formulas, but I'll try to think it through.

Alright, let's start by recalling what effective annual rate means. I remember that when interest is compounded more than once a year, the effective annual rate (EAR) is higher than the nominal rate because of the compounding effect. The formula I think is something like EAR = (1 + (r/n))^n - 1, where r is the nominal rate and n is the number of compounding periods.

So in this case, the nominal rate is 18%, which is 0.18 as a decimal. It's compounded quarterly, so n would be 4. Plugging those into the formula should give me the effective rate.

Wait, let me write that down step by step. The formula is (1 + r/n) raised to the power of n, minus one. So, r is 0.18, n is 4. So each quarter, the rate is 0.18/4, which is 0.045. So each compounding period, the factor is 1.045.

Now, I need to calculate (1.045)^4. Let me think how to compute that. Maybe I can compute it step by step:

1.045 squared is 1.045 * 1.045. Let's compute that. 1 *1 is 1, 1*0.045 is 0.045, 0.045*1 is 0.045, and 0.045*0.045 is about 0.002025. Adding those up: 1 + 0.045 + 0.045 + 0.002025 equals 1.092025. So 1.045 squared is approximately 1.092025.

Now, I need to square that result again because (1.045)^4 is (1.045^2)^2. So 1.092025 squared. Let me compute that. 

1.092025 * 1.092025. Hmm, perhaps I should break this down. Let's compute 1.09 *1.09 first. 1.09 squared is 1.1881. But wait, the actual number is 1.092025, which is a bit higher.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for squaring a number. (a + b)^2 = a² + 2ab + b². Let me let a=1.09, b=0.002025.

So a² is 1.1881. 2ab is 2 *1.09 *0.002025. Let me compute that: 1.09 *0.002025 is approximately 0.00220725. Multiply by 2: ~0.0044145.

Then b² is (0.002025)^2, which is approximately 0.0000041.

Adding them all together: 1.1881 + 0.0044145 = 1.1925145, plus 0.0000041 gives 1.1925186.

So (1.045)^4 ≈ 1.1925186. 

Now, subtract 1 from this to get the EAR. So 1.1925186 minus 1 is 0.1925186. So as a decimal, that's approximately 0.1925 or 19.25%.

Looking at the options provided:

A: 0.2075 → 20.75%
B: 0.2025 → 20.25%
C: 0.1775 → 17.75%
D: 0.1650 → 16.5%
E: 0.1725 →17.25%
F:0.2100 →21%
G:0.1925 →19.25%
H:0.1850 →18.5%
I:0.1999 →~20%
J:0.1825 →18.25%

So option G is 0.1925, which matches the calculation. So the answer should be G.

To calculate the effective annual rate (EAR) for an 18% nominal rate compounded quarterly, we use the formula:

\[
EAR = \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^n - 1
\]

Here, \( r = 0.18 \) (the nominal rate) and \( n = 4 \) (the number of compounding periods). Substituting these values:

\[
EAR = \left(1 + \frac{0.18}{4}\right)^4 - 1 = (1.045)^4 - 1
\]

First, calculate \( (1.045)^4 \). Breaking it down:

1. \( 1.045^2 = 1.045 \times 1.045 = 1.092025 \)
2. \( (1.092025)^2 = 1.092025 \times 1.092025 \approx 1.1925186 \)

Thus, \( (1.045)^4 \approx 1.1925186 \). Subtracting 1 gives:

\[
EAR = 1.1925186 - 1 = 0.1925186
\]

This rounds to approximately 0.1925, or 19.25%. Comparing this result to the provided options:

- **A: 0.2075** → 20.75% (too high)
- **B: 0.2025** → 20.25% (too high)
- **C: 0.1775** → 17.75% (too low)
- **D: 0.1650** → 16.5% (too low)
- **E: 0.1725** → 17.25% (too low)
- **F: 0.2100** → 21% (too high)
- **G: 0.1925** → 19.25% (matches the calculation)
- **H: 0.1850** → 18.5% (too low)
- **I: 0.1999** → ~20% (too high)
- **J: 0.1825** → 18.25% (too low)

The correct answer is **G: 0.1925**.
