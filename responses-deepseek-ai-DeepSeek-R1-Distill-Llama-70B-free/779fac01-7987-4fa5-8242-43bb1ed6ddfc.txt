Question:

A homeowner resides downhill from a metal fabrication facility. She has sued both the owner of the facility and the supplier of a solvent used at the facility. She contends that contaminants, consisting mostly of the solvent, were released into the ground at the facility and have migrated and continue to migrate to her property, contaminating the soil, the groundwater, and her well. She alleges various acts of negligence on the part of the facility owner in causing the release of the contaminants into the ground. She also alleges that employees of the solvent supplier were negligent in frequently the solvent supplier were negligent in frequently spilling some of the solvent onto the ground while filling a rooftop tank at the facility. The solvent supplier has moved for summary judgment, arguing that if there was any contamination, the facility owner and the supplier independently contributed indeterminate amounts to the contamination and that therefore the homeowner cannot show how much damage each has inflicted on her. There is no evidence that the facility owner and the solvent supplier acted in concert. Should the court grant the summary judgment motion?

Options:

A: No, because the solvent supplier should have taken precautions to prevent spills.
B: No, because the solvent supplier is directly responsible for the contamination.
C: Yes, because the solvent supplier can't be held accountable for the negligence of the facility owner.
D: Yes, because there is no basis for allocating damages against the solvent supplier. damages against the solvent supplier.
E: Yes, because the negligence of the facility owner is the primary cause of contamination.
F: No, because the solvent supplier is vicariously liable for damage inflicted by the facility owner.
G: Yes, because there is no evidence that the facility owner and the solvent supplier acted in concert.
H: Yes, because the homeowner does not have substantial proof of contamination.
I: No, because concurrent tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable for an indivisible injury.
J: No, because the solvent supplier and the facility owner are both responsible for the contamination, regardless of the amount each contributed.

Okay, I'm trying to tackle this multiple-choice question about tort law, specifically dealing with negligence and joint liability. Let's break it down step by step.

So, the scenario is that a homeowner is suing both the owner of a metal fabrication facility and the supplier of a solvent used there. She claims that contaminants, mostly the solvent, were released at the facility, migrated to her property, and contaminated her soil, groundwater, and well. She's alleging negligence on both parties' parts.

The facility owner's negligence is straightforwardâ€”she says they were negligent in releasing contaminants. But the solvent supplier's employees were also negligent in spilling some solvent while filling a rooftop tank. Now, the solvent supplier has moved for summary judgment, arguing that if there was contamination, both the facility owner and supplier contributed, but it's impossible to determine how much each is responsible for. There's no evidence they acted together, so the supplier says the homeowner can't prove how much damage each caused.

The question is whether the court should grant the summary judgment motion. The options are from A to J.

I remember that in tort law, when two or more tortfeasors cause an injury that can't be divided, they can be held jointly and severally liable. This is under the theory of joint and several liability, which means each defendant can be held responsible for the entire harm. But this applies when the harm is indivisible, meaning you can't separate the contributions of each tortfeasor.

In this case, the contamination is from both the facility's operations and the supplier's spills. The homeowner is claiming that the solvent migrated, causing her harm. The key point is whether the harm is indivisible. If it's impossible to determine each party's exact contribution, then joint and several liability applies, and each can be held fully responsible.

The supplier argues that because the contamination could have come from both, and there's no way to allocate damages, the homeowner can't prove causation against them specifically. But under joint and several liability, the plaintiff doesn't need to prove exact amounts if the harm is indivisible. Each defendant can be held liable for the entire damage.

So looking at the options:

Option I says: No, because concurrent tortfeasors are jointly and severally liable for an indivisible injury. That aligns with my reasoning. The homeowner doesn't need to allocate the exact damage each caused if the injury is indivisible.

Option J says both are responsible regardless of the amount, which also touches on joint liability, but I think I is more precise because it mentions concurrent tortfeasors and indivisible injury.

Looking at the other options, like A and B, they focus on the supplier's direct responsibility, but the main issue is about apportionment and joint liability.

So the correct answer should be I.
</think>

The court should not grant the solvent supplier's motion for summary judgment. Under the doctrine of joint and several liability, when concurrent tortfeasors cause an indivisible injury, each can be held responsible for the entire harm, regardless of the exact contribution of each. The homeowner's contamination claim is indivisible, making the supplier and facility owner jointly liable. Therefore, the supplier cannot escape liability by arguing the impossibility of allocating damages.

I

The answer is I.
