Okay, so I have this question about boiling points at high altitude. Hmm, I remember that atmospheric pressure affects the boiling point of water. At higher altitudes, the atmospheric pressure is lower, right?

The question says the altitude is 4000 meters, and the pressure is about 0.605 atm. I need to find the boiling point of water under these conditions. I think the boiling point decreases as pressure decreases. So, I should figure out what the boiling point is at 0.605 atm.

Wait, I remember that at standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm), water boils at 100°C. But when the pressure is lower, it boils at a lower temperature. I'm trying to recall if there's a formula or a table that relates pressure to boiling points. 

Oh right, there's something called the Clausius-Clapeyron equation which relates vapor pressure and temperature, but I'm not sure about the exact application. Maybe I can use an approximation or remember some common values.

I remember that at higher altitudes, like in mountainous regions, water boils at a lower temperature. For example, I think at around 2000 meters, it's maybe in the mid-90s Celsius. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, lower pressure should lower the boiling point. So higher altitude, lower pressure, lower boiling point.

Wait, I think the boiling point of water at 0.5 atm is somewhere around 81°C. Wait, but the pressure here is 0.605 atm, which is higher than 0.5 atm. So the boiling point should be higher than 81°C, but lower than 100°C.

I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Maybe I should use the formula for boiling point elevation or something. Or maybe use the Antoine equation, but I don't remember the exact coefficients.

Alternatively, maybe I can use an approximation method. Let's see, the normal boiling point is 100°C at 1 atm. The pressure is 0.605 atm, so about 60.5% of the standard pressure. So I'm guessing the boiling point would be lower than 100, but by how much?

I've heard that every 300 meters of altitude roughly lowers the boiling point by about 1°C. So 4000 meters is about 13 times 300, so 13°C less than 100°C. Wait, that would make it 87°C. Hmm, but I'm not sure if that's accurate because I think the relationship isn't linear. The decrease in boiling point is more pronounced at higher altitudes because the pressure drops more rapidly.

Wait another approach: maybe I can use the formula for boiling point at a given pressure. I think the formula is:

log(P2/P1) = (ΔHvap/R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2)

But wait, I'm not sure about the exact values. Alternatively, maybe I can use the ideal gas law, but that might be complicated without knowing the specific heat of vaporization. 

Alternatively, I can look for an approximate table in my mind. I think that at 0.5 atm, the boiling point is around 81°C. So 0.605 atm is higher than 0.5 atm, so the boiling point should be higher than 81. Let's say at 0.6 atm, it's maybe around 85-89°C?

Wait I've heard that at around 6300 meters, the pressure is about 0.3 atm, and the boiling point is around 70°C. So at 4000 meters, which is lower, the pressure is higher, so the boiling point is higher than 70°C.

Wait another approach: I'll try to recall some specific values. I think that at 0.5 atm, it's 81°C. So for each 0.1 atm, how much does the boiling point change? Maybe not linear, but let's see.

Between 0.5 and 1 atm, pressure increases by 0.5 atm. The boiling point goes from 81 to 100, so 19°C increase over 0.5 atm. So per 0.1 atm, that's about 3.8°C. So 0.605 atm is 0.105 atm above 0.5. So 0.105 * 3.8 ≈ 0.4°C. So 81 + 0.4 ≈ 81.4°C? Wait, that doesn't make sense because 0.6 is closer to 0.5 than 1.

Wait maybe that approach isn't correct. Let me think differently. Maybe I can use the equation for the boiling point using the vapor pressure.

The vapor pressure of water at various temperatures can be approximated by the Antoine equation:

log(P) = A - (B/(T + C))

Where P is the pressure in mmHg, and T is in °C. The constants A, B, C are specific to the substance. For water, I think the Antoine constants are A=8.14019, B=1810.94, C=244.485.

So, rearranging the equation to solve for T when P is known. But wait, here P is given in atm, so I'll need to convert that to mmHg.

Wait, 1 atm is 760 mmHg. So 0.605 atm is 0.605 * 760 = let's calculate that.

0.6 *760 = 456; 0.005*760=3.8; so 456+3.8=459.8 mmHg. About 460 mmHg.

So I need to find T where log(460) = 8.14019 - (1810.94/(T + 244.485)).

Let me plug this into the equation.

log(460) ≈ 2.6628.

So,

2.6628 = 8.14019 - (1810.94 / (T + 244.485)).

Subtract 8.14019 from both sides:

2.6628 - 8.14019 = - (1810.94/(T+244.485)).

-5.4774 = - (1810.94/(T+244.485)).

Multiply both sides by -1:

5.4774 = 1810.94 / (T + 244.485).

Now solve for T:

T + 244.485 = 1810.94 / 5.4774 ≈ 1810.94 / 5.4774 ≈ let's calculate that.

Hmm, 5.4774 * 330 = 5.4774*300=1643.22; 5.4774*30=164.322 → total 1807.542. That's close to 1810.94.

So 330 + (1810.94 - 1807.542)/5.4774 ≈ 330 + (3.398)/5.4774 ≈ 330 + 0.62 ≈ 330.62.

So T + 244.485 ≈ 330.62 → T ≈ 330.62 - 244.485 ≈ 86.135°C.

So the boiling point would be approximately 86.1°C. Looking at the options, option C is 86.2, which is very close. So I think the answer is C.

To determine the boiling point of water at an altitude of 4000 meters, where the atmospheric pressure is 0.605 atm, we use the relationship between pressure and boiling point. At standard atmospheric pressure (1 atm), water boils at 100°C, but as pressure decreases, the boiling point also decreases.

The Antoine equation is used to approximate the vapor pressure of water at different temperatures:

\[
\log(P) = A - \frac{B}{T + C}
\]

Where:
- \(P\) is the pressure in mmHg,
- \(T\) is the temperature in °C,
- \(A = 8.14019\), \(B = 1810.94\), and \(C = 244.485\) are constants for water.

First, convert the given pressure from atm to mmHg:
\[
0.605 \, \text{atm} \times 760 \, \text{mmHg/atm} = 459.8 \, \text{mmHg}.
\]

Substitute \(P = 459.8 \, \text{mmHg}\) into the Antoine equation:
\[
\log(459.8) \approx 2.6628 = 8.14019 - \frac{1810.94}{T + 244.485}.
\]

Rearranging the equation:
\[
2.6628 - 8.14019 = -\frac{1810.94}{T + 244.485},
\]
\[
-5.4774 = -\frac{1810.94}{T + 244.485}.
\]

Multiply through by \(-1\):
\[
5.4774 = \frac{1810.94}{T + 244.485}.
\]

Solve for \(T\):
\[
T + 244.485 = \frac{1810.94}{5.4774} \approx 330.62,
\]
\[
T = 330.62 - 244.485 \approx 86.135 \, \text{°C}.
\]

Thus, the boiling point of water at 0.605 atm is approximately 86.1°C. Among the given options, the closest value is **86.2°C**, corresponding to option C.
