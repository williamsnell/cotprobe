Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about the four-day compressed workweek. The question is asking what the best conclusion is regarding its effects. I remember that some studies have looked into shorter workweeks and their impacts on productivity and employee attitudes. 

From what I recall, when companies have tried a four-day workweek, like in some experiments I've heard about, productivity didn't necessarily drop. In fact, sometimes it stayed the same or even improved because people were more focused during their working hours. Maybe they had more rest, so they were more efficient when they were working. 

As for attitudes, I think employees generally liked the four-day schedule. People probably felt they had a better work-life balance, which would make them happier and more satisfied with their jobs. That makes sense because having an extra day off can reduce stress and allow more time for personal things, which would improve overall job attitudes.

Looking at the options, I need to find the one that says positive effects on both productivity and attitudes, or maybe one where at least one is positive without the other being negative. Let me go through the options:

Option J says long-lasting positive effects on both. That sounds plausible because if the initial studies showed positive results, they might last over time as employees adapt well to the new schedule.

Option E says positive productivity but little impact on attitudes. But I thought attitudes were positively affected.

Option D is positive on attitudes but no impact on productivity. I don't think that's right because I remember productivity was maintained or improved.

Option J seems to fit because it's positive on both and long-lasting. But wait, do the studies show that it's long-lasting? Maybe the question is about the best conclusion, not necessarily the longest-term effect.

Alternatively, the question might not specify the duration, so maybe the best conclusion is that there are positive effects on attitudes and productivity, but it's not specified if they're long-lasting. Oh wait, looking at the options, J is about long-lasting effects on both.

Hmm, but did the studies show that the effects were long-term? I'm not entirely sure, but I think the general consensus from some well-known trials, like the one in Iceland, showed that productivity remained the same or improved, and worker well-being increased. They continued the policy, so maybe the effects were lasting.

So the best conclusion would be that it has positive effects on both, and perhaps they last. So option J would be the correct answer.

The best conclusion is that the four-day compressed workweek has long-lasting positive effects on both attitudes and productivity.
