Question:

A plaintiff sued a utility company that owns a reservoir that is open to the public for recreation pursuant to a license from a federal agency. The plaintiff was severely injured in the reservoir when he dove from a boat into what he thought was deep water and hit an unmarked submerged island. The plaintiff alleges that the company was negligent in failing to mark the submerged island. At trial, the plaintiff has called an engineer and qualified him as plaintiff has called an engineer and qualified him as an expert in managing reservoirs. Which of the following opinions by the plaintiff's expert is the court most likely to admit?

Options:

A: "The plaintiff could have avoided the accident if he was more cautious."
B: "The plaintiff was not contributorily negligent."
C: "The accident probably occurred in the manner shown by this computer-animated film I made."
D: "The company's negligence is a result of poor management."
E: "The company could have marked the island in a day and at a cost of $300."
F: "The company was required by federal law to mark the island."
G: "The federal agency is responsible for this accident."
H: "The company is responsible for all accidents in the reservoir."
I: "The company was not required by federal law to mark the island."

Okay, so I've got this question about evidence law and expert testimony. Hmm, I need to figure out which opinion from the plaintiff's expert is most likely to be admitted in court. Let me think through this step by step.

First, the scenario: A plaintiff sued a utility company that owns a reservoir open to the public for recreation. The plaintiff was injured when he dove into what he thought was deep water but hit an unmarked submerged island. He claims the company was negligent for not marking the island. At trial, the plaintiff called an engineer who's an expert in managing reservoirs.

The question is about which expert opinion is admissible. The options are A through I, each with different statements. I remember that expert opinions must be based on reliable principles and methods, and the expert must apply them properly to the facts of the case. Also, experts can't testify on legal conclusions, like whether someone was negligent, because that's for the jury to decide.

Looking at the options:

Option A: "The plaintiff could have avoided the accident if he was more cautious." This seems like it's about the plaintiff's own negligence or contributory negligence. But I think that's a legal conclusion because it's about whether the plaintiff was at fault. Experts usually can't testify on that, so probably inadmissible.

Option B: "The plaintiff was not contributorily negligent." Again, this is a legal conclusion. The expert can describe what a reasonable person would do, but stating whether someone was contributorily negligent is for the court to decide. So this is likely inadmissible.

Option C: "The accident probably occurred in the manner shown by this computer-animated film." I'm not sure. If the animation is based on the expert's analysis and reliable data, it could be admissible. But does the expert's testimony about the animation's manner go beyond their expertise? Or is it acceptable as a visual aid explaining their opinion? Maybe this is admissible, but I'm not certain.

Option D: "The company's negligence is a result of poor management." This is a bit tricky. It might be seen as a legal conclusion because it's stating that the company was negligent, which is the ultimate issue. However, sometimes experts can opine on negligence if it's within their expertise. Wait, no, I think that's not right. Experts can't give opinions on legal conclusions, so this might be excluded.

Option E: "The company could have marked the island in a day and at a cost of $300." This sounds like it's about the feasibility of marking the island. As an expert in reservoir management, he can testify about the practicality, time, and cost, which are relevant to whether the company should have done it. This seems admissible because it's a factual opinion based on his expertise.

Option F: "The company was required by federal law to mark the island." This is a legal opinion. Experts can't testify about legal requirements unless it's within a recognized field, but generally, whether a law requires something is a legal question for the court. So this is probably inadmissible.

Option G: "The federal agency is responsible for this accident." Again, this is assigning legal responsibility, which is a conclusion for the jury. Experts can't testify on who is responsible, so this is out.

Option H: "The company is responsible for all accidents in the reservoir." Definitely a legal conclusion and too broad. Not admissible.

Option I: "The company was not required by federal law to mark the island." Also a legal conclusion. The expert can't testify on legal requirements unless it's part of their expertise in a way that's acceptable, but generally, this is for the court to decide. So inadmissible.

So narrowing it down, the options that seem admissible are C and E. Option C is about the manner of the accident shown in a film. If the expert can explain that the animation accurately depicts their opinion based on the facts, it might be allowed as a demonstrative aid. But sometimes courts are cautious about animations because they can be persuasive. However, if the expert's opinion is that the accident happened in that manner, it could be allowed.

Option E is about feasibility—time and cost to mark the island. This is a factual statement that helps the jury understand if the company's failure was reasonable. Since the expert is qualified in reservoir management, he can speak to standard practices and the practicality of marking the island.

Wait, but can the expert give an opinion on the cost and time? I think so, as that's within their technical knowledge. It helps in assessing whether the company's failure to mark was negligent.

So between C and E, which is more likely to be admitted. The question is about which opinion the court is most likely to admit. Opinions on ultimate issues (like negligence) are sometimes excluded, but expert opinions on underlying facts that lead to the conclusion are allowed.

Option E doesn't state a legal conclusion; it's about feasibility. So E is more likely to be admitted.

Wait, but what about option C? If the animation is based on the expert's analysis, it's a visual aid to explain his opinion. Courts allow experts to use such aids to illustrate their points, provided they are based on reliable methods. So the expert's statement that the accident probably occurred as shown in the animation would be their opinion on how the accident happened, which is within their expertise.

But then again, sometimes the use of animations can be considered prejudicial or misleading, so the court might exclude them. But the question is about the opinion, not the admission of the animation itself. The expert's opinion that the accident happened in that manner is admissible, assuming the animation is properly authenticated and based on reliable data.

Hmm, this is a bit confusing. Let me think about the rules again. Under FRE 702, expert opinions must be based on sufficient facts, reliable principles, and the expert must apply them reliably.

Option E is a factual statement about the company's ability to mark the island quickly and cheaply. That's relevant to the negligence claim—whether the company should have taken that precaution. The expert's opinion on that would be admissible.

Option C is about the manner of the accident, which is a factual issue. So the expert's opinion on that is also admissible, assuming the animation is a proper demonstrative exhibit.

But the question is which opinion is the court most likely to admit. Both E and C could be admissible, but maybe E is more straightforward as a factual statement. C's admissibility might depend more on the foundation of the animation, which isn't detailed here.

So perhaps the answer is E. But wait, the options are separate opinions. The expert is testifying about each statement. So which one is more likely to be admitted.

Another angle: Option E's statement is about the time and cost to mark the island. It's a factual opinion that doesn't reach a legal conclusion. It's about the feasibility, which is relevant. So that's likely admissible.

Option C's statement is about the accident's manner, which is also a factual matter. So both could be admissible, but the question is which is more likely.

Wait, another point: The plaintiff's expert can testify about the standard of care. If the standard requires marking submerged islands, the expert can say that. But in this case, option E is about how quickly and cheaply it could be done, which supports the argument that the company should have done it. So E seems more directly relevant and less likely to be excluded.

Therefore, I think option E is the correct answer.

To determine which opinion from the plaintiff's expert is most likely to be admitted, it is essential to analyze each option under the rules of evidence, particularly focusing on the admissibility of expert testimony. Expert opinions must be based on reliable principles and methods, and the expert must apply them properly to the facts of the case. Additionally, experts generally cannot testify on legal conclusions, as those are reserved for the court or jury.

### Analysis of Each Option:

- **Option A**: "The plaintiff could have avoided the accident if he was more cautious."  
  This statement addresses the plaintiff's potential contributory negligence, which is a legal conclusion. Experts are generally barred from testifying on legal conclusions, making this opinion inadmissible.

- **Option B**: "The plaintiff was not contributorily negligent."  
  Similar to Option A, this is a legal conclusion about contributory negligence. Such determinations are for the court or jury, not the expert, so this opinion is likely inadmissible.

- **Option C**: "The accident probably occurred in the manner shown by this computer-animated film I made."  
  This opinion could be admissible if the animation is based on reliable data and methods. However, the admissibility of the animation itself might depend on additional foundational requirements, such as authentication and reliability. While the expert's opinion on the manner of the accident is within their expertise, the use of the animation might raise concerns about prejudice or misleading nature.

- **Option D**: "The company's negligence is a result of poor management."  
  This statement appears to be a legal conclusion, as it directly attributes negligence to the company. Experts are typically not allowed to testify on ultimate legal issues like negligence, making this opinion likely inadmissible.

- **Option E**: "The company could have marked the island in a day and at a cost of $300."  
  This is a factual statement about the feasibility of marking the island, which is relevant to the negligence claim. As an expert in reservoir management, the witness can testify about the practicality, time, and cost of such measures. This opinion does not reach a legal conclusion and is based on the expert's technical knowledge, making it admissible.

- **Option F**: "The company was required by federal law to mark the island."  
  This is a legal opinion about a regulatory requirement. Whether a law requires a specific action is a question for the court, not the expert, so this opinion is likely inadmissible.

- **Option G**: "The federal agency is responsible for this accident."  
  This assigns legal responsibility, which is a conclusion for the jury. Experts cannot testify on who is responsible, making this opinion inadmissible.

- **Option H**: "The company is responsible for all accidents in the reservoir."  
  This is a broad legal conclusion about liability. Such statements are inappropriate for expert testimony and are inadmissible.

- **Option I**: "The company was not required by federal law to mark the island."  
  Similar to Option F, this is a legal opinion about regulatory requirements. It is a question for the court, not the expert, so this opinion is likely inadmissible.

### Conclusion:
Option E is the most likely to be admitted because it is a factual statement about the feasibility of marking the island, which is relevant to the negligence claim and within the expert's technical knowledge. While Option C could also be admissible, its reliance on a computer-animated film introduces additional foundational requirements that are not detailed in the question. Therefore, Option E is the stronger choice.
