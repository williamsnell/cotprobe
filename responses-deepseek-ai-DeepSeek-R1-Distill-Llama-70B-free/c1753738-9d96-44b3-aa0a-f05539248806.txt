Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the missing mass of a fluorine isotope, right? Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Alright, let's see. The question is about finding the missing mass when the atomic weight is given, and the masses of a proton, neutron, and electron are provided. Oh wait, I remember something about binding energy and mass defect. Oh right, the mass defect is the difference between the sum of the individual protons, neutrons, and electrons and the actual atomic mass. That missing mass is the mass defect, which gets converted into binding energy.

So, let's break down the problem. The isotope in question is ^19_9F. So, the atomic number is 9, which means it has 9 protons. Fluorine has 9 protons normally, right? So the number of neutrons would be the mass number minus protons. The mass number is 19, so 19 - 9 = 10 neutrons. So the nucleus has 9 protons and 10 neutrons.

Wait, but fluorine is a neutral atom, so the number of electrons should equal the number of protons, which is 9. So I need to account for the mass of 9 electrons as well.

Now, the atomic weight given is 18.9984 amu. I think that's the actual measured mass of the atom, including electrons and the nucleus.

So, each proton has a mass of 1.00728 amu, each neutron is 1.00867, and each electron is 0.000549. 

So, the total mass if all particles were separate would be:

protons: 9 * 1.00728
neutrons: 10 * 1.00867
electrons: 9 * 0.000549

Then the sum of these three would be the theoretical mass, and the difference between this sum and the actual atomic weight is the mass defect.

Wait, let me make sure. The actual atomic mass is the measured mass of the atom, which includes electrons. So the expected mass without binding would be (protons + neutrons) * their masses plus electrons.

Wait, or wait: the nucleus is protons and neutrons. Electrons are in the atom, so the atomic mass includes the electrons. So the calculation should be: (mass of protons + neutrons) + (mass of electrons) minus the atomic mass equals the mass defect? Or wait, I might have it the other way around.

Wait, maybe it's:

Theoretical mass = (protons * m_p) + (neutrons * m_n) + (electrons * m_e)
Actual mass = atomic weight
Mass defect = Theoretical mass - Actual mass

Yes, because when the nucleus forms, some mass is lost as binding energy, so the actual mass is less than the sum. Oh wait, no, wait a second. Wait, the sum of individual masses of protons, neutrons, and electrons is more than the actual atomic mass. So the mass defect is the sum minus the atomic mass.

Wait, no, wait. The atomic mass includes the electrons. So the sum of protons, neutrons, and electrons would be the theoretical mass. But in reality, the atomic mass is less because the binding energy (mass defect) is the missing mass that's converted into energy.

So the mass defect (missing mass) should be:

mass_defect = (sum of protons, neutrons, electrons) - actual atomic weight.

But wait, let me think again. The actual atomic mass is the mass of the atom, which includes the electrons. The sum of the protons, neutrons, and electrons is the mass if all were separate. But when the nucleus forms, mass is lost. So the mass of the nucleus is (protons + neutrons) - (mass defect of nucleus), but when considering the entire atom, the electrons are part of the atomic mass. Hmm, maybe I should approach it step by step.

Alternatively, perhaps the mass defect is calculated as:

mass_defect = (Z*m_p + N*m_n + Z*m_e) - M_atomic

Where Z is number of protons, N is number of neutrons, and M_atomic is the atomic weight given.

So in this case, Z =9, N=10.

So let me compute each part step by step.

First, calculate Z*m_p: 9 * 1.00728 = let me compute 9 * 1.00728.

1.00728 * 9: 1.00728 *10 is 10.0728, minus 1.00728 gives 9.06552 amu.

Next, N * m_n: 10 * 1.00867 = 10.0867 amu.

Then, electrons: Z * m_e = 9 * 0.000549 = 0.004941 amu.

So sum all three: 9.06552 + 10.0867 = 19.15222 + 0.004941 = 19.157161 amu.

The atomic weight is 18.9984 amu.

So mass defect is 19.157161 - 18.9984 = let's compute that.

19.157161 - 18.9984 = 0.158761 amu.

Looking at the options, option D is 0.1588, which is very close to what I got. So the answer should be D.

To calculate the missing mass (mass defect) of the fluorine isotope (^19_9F), we start by determining the theoretical mass of the atom if its protons, neutrons, and electrons were separate. The isotope has 9 protons, 10 neutrons, and 9 electrons. Using the given masses:

- Mass of a proton: \( m_p = 1.00728 \, \text{amu} \)
- Mass of a neutron: \( m_n = 1.00867 \, \text{amu} \)
- Mass of an electron: \( m_e = 0.000549 \, \text{amu} \)

The theoretical mass is calculated as:

\[
\text{Theoretical mass} = (Z \cdot m_p) + (N \cdot m_n) + (Z \cdot m_e)
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Theoretical mass} = (9 \cdot 1.00728) + (10 \cdot 1.00867) + (9 \cdot 0.000549)
\]

1. \( 9 \cdot 1.00728 = 9.06552 \, \text{amu} \)
2. \( 10 \cdot 1.00867 = 10.0867 \, \text{amu} \)
3. \( 9 \cdot 0.000549 = 0.004941 \, \text{amu} \)

Adding these together:

\[
\text{Theoretical mass} = 9.06552 + 10.0867 + 0.004941 = 19.157161 \, \text{amu}
\]

The actual atomic weight of the isotope is given as \( 18.9984 \, \text{amu} \). The mass defect is the difference between the theoretical mass and the actual atomic weight:

\[
\text{Mass defect} = \text{Theoretical mass} - \text{Actual atomic weight}
\]

\[
\text{Mass defect} = 19.157161 - 18.9984 = 0.158761 \, \text{amu}
\]

Comparing this result to the provided options, the closest value is \( 0.1588 \, \text{amu} \), which corresponds to option D.
