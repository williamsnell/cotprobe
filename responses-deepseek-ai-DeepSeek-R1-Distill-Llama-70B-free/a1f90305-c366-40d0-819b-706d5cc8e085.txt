Okay, so I've got this limit problem to solve: the limit as n approaches infinity of (n!)^(1/n) divided by n. Hmm, I remember that factorials grow really fast, but I'm not exactly sure how to approach this. Let me think through it step by step.

First, I know that Stirling's approximation might be useful here. Stirling's formula approximates n! for large n. The formula is n! ≈ sqrt(2πn) * (n/e)^n. So maybe I can substitute that into the expression.

Let me rewrite the limit using Stirling's approximation. The expression is (n!)^(1/n) / n. Substituting Stirling's formula, that becomes [sqrt(2πn) * (n/e)^n]^(1/n) divided by n.

Breaking that down, the nth root of sqrt(2πn) would be (2πn)^(1/(2n)). And the nth root of (n/e)^n is just n/e. So putting it together, the numerator becomes (2πn)^(1/(2n)) * (n/e). Then we divide that by n.

Wait, so let me write that out: [(2πn)^(1/(2n)) * (n/e)] / n. Simplifying that, the n's in the numerator and denominator would cancel out, leaving (2πn)^(1/(2n)) / e.

Now I have to evaluate the limit of this as n approaches infinity. Let's look at (2πn)^(1/(2n)). Taking the natural log of this term might help. Let me call that term A: A = (2πn)^(1/(2n)). Taking ln(A) gives (1/(2n)) * ln(2πn). 

As n approaches infinity, ln(2πn) grows, but it's divided by 2n, which goes to zero. So the whole expression ln(A) tends to zero. That means A tends to e^0, which is 1. So the limit of A as n approaches infinity is 1.

Putting it all together, the expression simplifies to (1) / e. So the limit is 1/e. Wait, 1/e is approximately 0.367879441. Looking at the options, option D is 0.367879441, which matches.

I think that's right, but let me double-check. Alternatively, I could take the natural logarithm of the original expression and then find the limit. Let me try that approach to confirm.

Let’s denote the original expression as L = (n!)^(1/n) / n. Taking ln(L) gives (1/n) ln(n!) - ln(n). Using Stirling's approximation again, ln(n!) ≈ n ln n - n + (1/2) ln(2πn). So substituting that in, we have:

ln(L) ≈ [ (n ln n - n + (1/2) ln(2πn)) / n ] - ln(n)
= [ln n - 1 + (ln(2πn))/(2n)] - ln n
= -1 + (ln(2πn))/(2n)

As n approaches infinity, the term (ln(2πn))/(2n) goes to zero because the denominator grows much faster than the numerator. So ln(L) approaches -1. Therefore, L approaches e^(-1) = 1/e ≈ 0.367879441. Yep, same result.

So the correct answer should be option D.

To evaluate the limit of \((n!)^{1/n}/n\) as \(n\) approaches infinity, we can use Stirling's approximation for \(n!\), which is:

\[
n! \approx \sqrt{2\pi n} \left(\frac{n}{e}\right)^n
\]

Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{(n!)^{1/n}}{n} \approx \frac{\left(\sqrt{2\pi n} \left(\frac{n}{e}\right)^n\right)^{1/n}}{n}
\]

Breaking this down:

1. The \(n\)-th root of \(\sqrt{2\pi n}\) is \((2\pi n)^{1/(2n)}\).
2. The \(n\)-th root of \(\left(\frac{n}{e}\right)^n\) is \(\frac{n}{e}\).

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{(2\pi n)^{1/(2n)} \cdot \frac{n}{e}}{n} = \frac{(2\pi n)^{1/(2n)}}{e}
\]

Now, consider the term \((2\pi n)^{1/(2n)}\). Taking the natural logarithm:

\[
\ln\left((2\pi n)^{1/(2n)}\right) = \frac{\ln(2\pi n)}{2n}
\]

As \(n \to \infty\), \(\ln(2\pi n)\) grows logarithmically, but it is divided by \(2n\), which grows linearly. Therefore, \(\frac{\ln(2\pi n)}{2n} \to 0\), and \((2\pi n)^{1/(2n)} \to e^0 = 1\).

This leaves the expression as:

\[
\frac{1}{e}
\]

The value of \(1/e\) is approximately \(0.367879441\). Comparing this to the options, the correct answer is:

**D: 0.367879441**
