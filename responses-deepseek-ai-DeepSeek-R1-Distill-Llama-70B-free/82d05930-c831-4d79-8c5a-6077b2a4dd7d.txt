Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this question about an enlarged submandibular salivary gland. Let me start by recalling what I know about the submandibular gland and how it's examined.

The submandibular gland is one of the major salivary glands. I remember that it's located under the mandible, which is the lower jawbone. So, it's in the submandibular triangle, I think. Now, when this gland becomes enlarged, like in cases of inflammation, infection, or maybe a tumor, it should be palpable, right? 

Palpable means it can be felt by touch. Now, the question is whether it's palpable intraorally (inside the mouth) or extraorally (outside the mouth on the neck area). Hmm. Let me visualize where this gland is. The submandibular gland is beneath the jaw, so from the outside, you can feel it by pressing just below the jawline. Intraorally, I think the gland is located near the floor of the mouth. So if it's enlarged, you might be able to feel it both inside and outside the mouth.

Wait, but how does that work? Let me think. If the gland is swollen, it can cause a bulge in the neck area, which would be extraoral. But since it's attached near the floor of the mouth, it might also cause a swelling that's noticeable when you examine inside the mouth. So both areas would allow palpation.

Looking at the options, option B says it's palpable both intra- and extraorally. Option G says only extraorally. I'm not sure, but I think the gland is large enough that both areas would be affected. 

Wait, another thought: sometimes, intraoral examination might be limited because of the mouth's structures. The submandibular gland is located under the mylohyoid muscle. When it's enlarged, it can push up into the floor of the mouth, making it palpable intraorally. So from the inside, you can press the floor of the mouth and feel the enlargement, and from the outside, under the jaw, you can feel the swelling too. So both should be possible.

So looking at the options, option B says both, which seems correct. Other options: like G says only extraorally. But I think it's both. So the answer should be B.

Wait, but another thought: perhaps the gland is more easily palpable extraorally. Maybe the intraoral part isn't as accessible. But I remember that during intraoral exams, the submandibular gland area is checked by palpating the floor of the mouth. So if it's enlarged, you can feel it there. So yes, both.

I think the correct answer is B.

The submandibular salivary gland is located beneath the mandible and can be palpated both intraorally and extraorally when enlarged. Intraorally, it may cause a bulge in the floor of the mouth, while extraorally, it can be felt as a swelling under the jawline. Therefore, an enlarged submandibular gland is expected to be palpable in both locations.

Answer: B
