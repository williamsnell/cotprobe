Question:

Bill, a single man, owned pasture land in Deerwoods, Florida, which he leased to a tenant. He also owned a condominium in Miami, which he held for investment. In his will, he devised the pasture land to his son Tommy and the condominium to his daughter Julie. All other assets would pass equally to Tommy and Julie. Bill met Kathy and married her after she executed a valid prenuptial agreement relinquishing all rights she might otherwise enjoy by marrying Bill. On their Miami honeymoon they drove by the condominium and Kathy declared she'd love to live there. Bill was so happy with Kathy that after the honeymoon he signed and delivered to Kathy a deed conveying the condominium to himself and Kathy as an estate by the entirety and made plans to live in the condominium as soon as the tenant vacated. Bill died the next day. How are the foregoing assets distributed?

Options:

A: Kathy gets the condominium, but because Bill had originally indicated his intent to devise equally to his children, Tommy and Julie will split the remaining estate.
B: Julie receives the condominium due to her father's original will, Tommy gets the pasture land, and the rest of the estate is split between Tommy and Julie.
C: Kathy gets the condominium due to the deed, Tommy gets the pasture land, and the rest of the estate is split evenly between Tommy, Julie, and Kathy.
D: Kathy, as the surviving spouse, gets the entire estate regardless of the prenuptial agreement.
E: Tommy and Julie split all assets equally, as the prenuptial agreement nullifies any changes made after the marriage.
F: Regardless of the prenuptial agreement, Kathy is a pretermitted spouse. Since Bill leaves surviving lineal descendants who are not Kathy's, Kathy receives 50% of the estate, Tommy gets the pasture land, and Tommy and Julie split the residue of the estate.
G: Kathy gets the condominium regardless of the prenuptial agreement, Tommy takes the pasture land and Tommy and Julie split the rest of the estate.
H: Tommy receives the pasture land, Julie gets the condominium, and the rest of the estate is split between Tommy and Julie, as Kathy signed a prenuptial agreement.
I: Tommy gets the pasture land, Kathy gets the condominium due to her husband's last wish, and the remaining estate is split between Tommy, Julie, and Kathy.
J: Due to Kathy's prenuptial agreement, Tommy receives the pasture land, Julie gets the condominium and Tommy and Julie split the rest of the estate.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about the distribution of Bill's assets after his death. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I remember that when someone dies, their assets are distributed according to their will, but also considering any legal claims others might have, like a spouse. So Bill was married to Kathy, and they had a prenuptial agreement. I think prenups can affect what the spouse inherits, but I'm not exactly sure how.

Bill had two main assets: pasture land and a condominium. He had a will that left the pasture land to his son Tommy and the condo to his daughter Julie. The rest of his assets were to be split equally between Tommy and Julie. So originally, without any changes, that's how it would go.

But then Bill met Kathy and married her after she signed a prenup. After the honeymoon, Bill gave Kathy a deed making the condo theirs as an estate by the entirety. This means they both owned it together, right? So when one dies, the other gets the entire property.

Wait, but what about the will? Bill's will said the condo goes to Julie. But if he later conveyed it to himself and Kathy as tenants by the entirety, then the will might not affect that because it's a transfer during his lifetime. So the deed would override the will, right? Because once he transferred it, it's no longer part of his estate to devise in the will.

So Kathy would get the condo because of the deed. But what about the pasture land? The will says it goes to Tommy, and there's no indication that Bill transferred that, so Tommy still gets the pasture land.

Now, the rest of the assets. The will says the rest goes equally to Tommy and Julie. But wait, after Bill married Kathy, does she have any claim on the estate beyond what the prenup says? The prenup was valid, so Kathy gave up any rights she might have had as a spouse. That probably includes any elective share or intestate succession rights. But does it affect the deed he gave her?

Hmm, the deed was a gift during their marriage, so that's a separate issue from the will and the prenup. The prenup probably can't take away what's already been given through the deed because that's a completed gift. So Kathy still gets the condo.

Now, the residue of the estate—what's left after the specific gifts—are split equally between Tommy and Julie. Since the pasture land and condo were specific gifts, the residue would be all other assets. But does Kathy get anything from the residue? Probably not, because the prenup says she relinquishes her rights. So the residue goes to Tommy and Julie equally.

Putting it all together: Kathy gets the condo, Tommy gets the pasture land, and the rest is split between Tommy and Julie. Looking at the options, option G says exactly that. So I think the answer is G.

The correct distribution of Bill's assets is determined by analyzing the legal implications of the events described:

1. **Condominium**: Bill conveyed the condominium to himself and Kathy as an estate by the entirety before his death. This was a valid inter vivos transfer, meaning the condominium is no longer part of Bill's estate and passes entirely to Kathy upon his death. The prenuptial agreement does not affect this transfer because it was a completed gift.

2. **Pasture Land**: Bill's will devised the pasture land to Tommy, and there is no indication that this asset was transferred during Bill's lifetime. Therefore, Tommy inherits the pasture land as per the will.

3. **Residue of the Estate**: The will states that all other assets are to be split equally between Tommy and Julie. Kathy, as Bill's spouse, signed a valid prenuptial agreement relinquishing her rights to Bill's estate. As a result, Kathy does not inherit any portion of the residue, which is divided equally between Tommy and Julie.

Thus, Kathy receives the condominium, Tommy receives the pasture land, and the remaining assets are split equally between Tommy and Julie.
