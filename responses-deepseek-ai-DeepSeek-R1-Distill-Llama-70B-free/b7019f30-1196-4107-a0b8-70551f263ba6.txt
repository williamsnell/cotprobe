Okay, so I've got this problem to solve about calculating the storage requirement for a video. Hmm, let's see. The video is one hour long, color, in YUV format. The frame resolution is 1920x1080, and it uses a 4:2:2 color subsampling. Each component is 8 bits, and the frame rate is 30 frames per second. I need to find the storage in gigabytes, with three significant figures.

Alright, let me break this down. I'm a bit rusty on video encoding, but I'll try to remember. YUV color space separates luminance (Y) from chrominance (UV). The 4:2:2 subsampling means that for each 2x2 block of pixels, there are 2 U and 2 V samples. So, the chroma components are subsampled horizontally but not vertically.

First, I think I should calculate the number of pixels per frame. The resolution is 1920x1080, so total pixels are 1920 * 1080. Let me compute that. 1920 times 1000 is 1,920,000, and 1920*80 is 153,600. So 1,920,000 + 153,600 = 2,073,600 pixels per frame.

Now, for the YUV 4:2:2 format. Each frame has Y, U, and V components. Since it's 4:2:2, the U and V have half the horizontal resolution of Y. So, for the Y component, it's 1920 x 1080. For U and V, it's 1920/2 x 1080 each. So U and V each have 960 x 1080 pixels.

Calculating each component's size per frame:

Y component: 1920 * 1080 = 2,073,600 pixels.
U component: 960 * 1080 = 1,036,800 pixels.
V component: same as U, 1,036,800 pixels.

Each pixel is 8 bits, so each component's bits per frame would be:

Y: 2,073,600 * 8 = 16,588,800 bits.
U: 1,036,800 * 8 = 8,294,400 bits.
V: same as U, 8,294,400 bits.

Adding them together for the total per frame:

16,588,800 + 8,294,400 + 8,294,400 = let's see, 16.5888e6 + 8.2944e6 * 2.

16.5888e6 + 16.5888e6 = 33.1776e6 bits per frame. Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, 16.5888 + 8.2944 +8.2944 = 33.1776 million bits per frame.

Wait, 33.1776e6 bits is equal to 4,147,200 bytes per frame because 1 byte is 8 bits. So 33,177,600 bits divided by 8 is 4,147,200 bytes.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to calculate the total bytes per frame first. Since each component's size in bytes would be (pixels * bits) / 8.

So Y: (1920*1080 *8)/8 = 1920*1080 = 2,073,600 bytes.
U: (960*1080 *8)/8 = 960*1080 = 1,036,800 bytes.
V: same as U, 1,036,800 bytes.

Total per frame: 2,073,600 + 1,036,800 + 1,036,800 = 4,147,200 bytes per frame. Yep, same as before.

Now, the video is 30 frames per second. So per second, the data rate is 4,147,200 bytes/frame * 30 frames/s = let's compute that.

4,147,200 *30 = 124,416,000 bytes per second.

There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so total bytes per hour would be 124,416,000 * 3600 bytes.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 30 frames per second, so for one hour (3600 seconds), total frames are 30 *3600 = 108,000 frames.

So total bytes would be 4,147,200 bytes/frame * 108,000 frames.

Let me compute that.

First, 4,147,200 * 100,000 = 414,720,000,000 bytes.

Then, 4,147,200 * 8,000 = let's see. 4,147,200 *8=33,177,600, so multiplying by 1000: 33,177,600,000 bytes.

Adding those together: 414,720,000,000 + 33,177,600,000 = 447,897,600,000 bytes.

Wait, wait, that can't be right. Because 4,147,200 *108,000 = 4,147,200 * (100,000 +8,000) = 414,720,000,000 + 33,177,600,000 = 447,897,600,000 bytes.

Now, convert bytes to gigabytes. 1 GB is 1e9 bytes (since 1GB = 10^9 bytes, right? Or is it 2^30 which is approx 1.07e9? But usually, in data storage, it's 1 GB = 1e9 bytes).

So 447,897,600,000 bytes ÷ 1e9 = 447.8976 GB.

But wait, looking at the options, the highest is A:600, I:525, etc. So 447.8976 is about 448 GB.

Looking at the options, option G is 450, which is close.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because I might have made an error.

Wait, 1920x1080 is 2,073,600 pixels for Y. Then U and V are 960x1080 each, so 1,036,800 each.

So per frame:

Y: 2,073,600 *8 bits = 16,588,800 bits.

U: 1,036,800 *8 = 8,294,400 bits.

Same for V.

Total bits per frame: 16,588,800 + 8,294,400 *2 = 16,588,800 + 16,588,800 = 33,177,600 bits per frame.

So bits per frame: 33,177,600 bits.

Convert to bytes: 33,177,600 /8 = 4,147,200 bytes per frame.

Frames per second:30.

So per second: 4,147,200 *30 = 124,416,000 bytes/s.

In one hour (3600 seconds): 124,416,000 *3600 = ?

Let me compute this:

124,416,000 * 3600 = ?

Compute 124,416,000 * 3,600.

Wait, 124,416,000 * 3,600 = 124,416,000 * (3.6e3) )= 124,416,000 *3.6e3.

Wait, 124,416,000 * 3,600 = 124,416,000 *3.6 *1e3 = let's compute 124,416,000 *3.6 first.

124,416,000 *3 = 373,248,000.

124,416,000 *0.6 = 74,649,600.

So 373,248,000 +74,649,600=447,897,600.

Then multiply by 1e3 (since 3.6e3 is 3600), so 447,897,600,000 bytes.

Which is 447.8976e9 bytes, which is 447.8976 GB.

Rounded to three significant figures, that's 448 GB. But none of the options are exactly 448. The closest option is G:450.

Wait, but let me check if I made a mistake in the YUV 4:2:2 calculation. Another way to think about YUV 4:2:2 is that for each 2x2 block, you have 4 Y, 2 U, and 2 V. So the total samples per 2x2 block are 4Y + 2U + 2V = 8 samples.

In terms of bits, each sample is 8 bits. So per 2x2 block, it's 8 *8=64 bits.

Now, the total number of 2x2 blocks in a 1920x1080 frame is (1920/2) * (1080/2) )= 960 * 540 = 518,400 blocks.

Each block has 64 bits, so total bits per frame: 518,400 *64 = let's compute that.

518,400 *64 = ?

518,400 *60=31,104,000.

518,400 *4=2,073,600.

Total: 31,104,000 + 2,073,600 =33,177,600 bits.

Same as before. So that's consistent. So per frame, 33,177,600 bits, which is 4,147,200 bytes.

So my initial calculation seems correct.

Therefore, the total storage is approximately 447.8976 GB, which is 448 GB when rounded to three significant figures (since the fourth digit is 9, which rounds up the third digit 7 to 8).

Looking at the options, the closest is G:450, but wait, the options given are:

A:600

B:490

C:417

D:320

E:375

F:500

G:450

H:350

I:525

J:275

So 448 is not exactly listed, but perhaps I made a miscalculation. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects a different approach.

Wait, perhaps the chroma subsampling is 4:2:2 which reduces the data differently. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the storage is calculated as Y being full resolution, and U and V being half in each dimension. So Y is 1920x1080, U is 1920x1080 but subsampled by 2 in the horizontal direction, so 1920/2 x 1080 for U and V. Wait, no, 4:2:2 means that for every 2x2 pixels, you have 2 U and 2 V. So U and V are each 960 x 1080.

So that's correct as before.

Wait, perhaps the frame rate is 30 per second, so 30 *3600= 108,000 frames.

Each frame is 4,147,200 bytes. So 108,000 *4,147,200 = ?

Let me compute that.

4,147,200 *108,000 = ?

We can write 4,147,200 = approx 4.1472e6.

4.1472e6 * 1.08e5 = 4.1472 *1.08 * 1e11.

4.1472 *1.08: let's compute that.

4 *1.08 =4.32.

0.1472 *1.08: 0.1472*1=0.1472, 0.1472*0.08=0.011776. So total 0.158976.

So 4.32 + 0.158976=4.478976.

So 4.478976e11 bytes.

Convert to gigabytes: 4.478976e11 /1e9 = 447.8976 GB, same as before.

So 447.9 GB, which is approximately 448 GB. But the options don't have 448. The closest is G:450.

Wait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the way bits and bytes are calculated again.

Wait, Y is 1920x1080x8 bits.

U is 960x1080x8 bits.

V is 960x1080x8 bits.

So total bits per frame: (1920*1080 + 960*1080*2) *8.

Alternatively, compute as (1920*1080) + 2*(960*1080) ) *8.

Alternatively, factor 1080 out.

Wait, 1920 + 2*(960) = 1920 + 1920 = 3840.

So 1080 * 3840 *8 ?

Wait, no, because Y is 1920*1080, and each of U and V are 960*1080.

So for each component:

Y: 1920 *1080 = 2,073,600 pixels.

U:960 *1080=1,036,800.

V: same as U.

So per frame, the total pixels are 2,073,600 + 1,036,800 +1,036,800 = 4,147,200 pixels.

Each pixel is 8 bits. So 4,147,200 *8 = 33,177,600 bits per frame.

Which is 4,147,200 bytes per frame.

Yes, so that's correct.

So 4,147,200 bytes/frame * 30 frames/s = 124,416,000 bytes/s.

Multiply by 3600 seconds: 124,416,000 *3600.

Let me compute 124,416,000 * 3600.

Well, 124,416,000 * 3,600 = (124,416,000 * 3) * 1,200.

Wait, 124,416,000 *3 = 373,248,000.

373,248,000 * 1,200 = ?

373,248,000 *1,000 = 373,248,000,000.

373,248,000 *200 =74,649,600,000.

Total: 373,248,000,000 +74,649,600,000 =447,897,600,000 bytes.

Which is 447.8976e9 bytes, so 447.8976 GB.

Rounding to three significant figures, that's 448 GB.

But the options don't have 448. The closest is G:450, which is 450 GB.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the frame count. Let me double-check.

One hour is 60 minutes, 60*60=3600 seconds.

At 30 frames per second, total frames are 30 * 3600 = 108,000 frames.

Yes.

Each frame is 4,147,200 bytes.

Multiply: 108,000 *4,147,200.

Wait, 100,000 frames would be 414,720,000,000 bytes.

8,000 frames would be 8,000 *4,147,200 = 33,177,600,000 bytes.

414,720,000,000 +33,177,600,000 =447,897,600,000 bytes.

Same as before.

So I'm confident the correct value is approximately 448 GB, but the options don't include that. So perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, looking back, perhaps the question is in YUV format, but maybe it's considering YUV 4:2:2 where each component is stored with a certain bit depth.

Alternatively, perhaps I should have considered that in 4:2:2, the U and V each have half the horizontal resolution, but same vertical, so for each line, the U and V are halved.

Wait, perhaps the total data per frame is (1920 *1080) *8 for Y, plus (1920/2 *1080)*8 for U, and same for V.

Wait, that's exactly what I did. So yes.

Alternatively, perhaps the storage is calculated differently, like using megabytes instead of gigabytes, but no, the question asks for Gbytes.

Wait, maybe I'm using 1 GB as 1e9 bytes. What if the question expects 1 GB as 1024^3 bytes? Let me check.

If 1 GB is 1024^3 = 1,073,741,824 bytes.

So, 447,897,600,000 bytes divided by 1,073,741,824.

Compute 447,897,600,000 /1,073,741,824 ≈ ?

Well, 447,897,600,000 ÷ 1,073,741,824.

Let me compute approximately.

1,073,741,824 ≈ 1.07e9.

So 447.8976e9 /1.07e9 ≈ 418.5.

So about 418.5 GB, which would be approximately 419 GB. But looking at the options, option C is 417, which is close.

Wait, but this would depend on whether the storage uses SI units (1 GB =1e9) or binary units (1 GB=1024^3). The question says Gbytes, which usually implies 1e9, but sometimes people use it differently.

Hmm, the initial calculation gives 447.9 GB (using 1e9). But if using 1.07e9 per GB, it's about 418 GB. So option C is 417, which is close.

Wait, but I'm getting conflicting possibilities here. So which one is correct? The question says 'in Gbytes (3 sig. fig.)'.

In data storage, manufacturers often use 1 MB = 1e6 bytes, 1 GB =1e9 bytes. So in that case, 447.8976 GB is correct.

But perhaps the question expects the other approach. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of bits to bytes.

Wait, another approach: sometimes, the data rate is calculated in bits, then divided by 8 to get bytes. Let me try that.

Total bits per second: 33,177,600 bits/frame *30 frames/s = 997,328,000 bits/s.

Convert to bytes: 997,328,000 /8 =124,416,000 bytes/s.

In an hour (3600 s), that's 124,416,000 *3600 =447,897,600,000 bytes, same as before.

So same result.

So I think the correct answer is approximately 448 GB, but the options don't have that. The closest is G:450.

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake in the calculation, such as using 25 frames per second instead of 30. Let me see.

If frame rate was 25 fps, then frames per hour would be 25*3600=90,000.

90,000 *4,147,200 = 373,248,000,000 bytes.

373.248e9 bytes =373.248 GB. Closest option is H:350, but that's not matching.

Alternatively, maybe the color
