Okay, I need to figure out which BASIC program correctly converts inches into feet and inches. Let's start by understanding the problem. The task is to write a program that takes a number of inches and converts it into feet and remaining inches. So for any given value I, we should calculate how many whole feet (F) there are and the leftover inches (I1).

Looking at the options, each one has a similar structure but with different calculations for F and I1. I'll go through each option step by step.

Option A:
- Line 20: F = INT(I/12). That makes sense because there are 12 inches in a foot. So F is the number of feet.
- Line 30: I1 = I - (F+1)*12. Wait, if I subtract (F+1)*12, that would actually give a negative number because F is the integer division. For example, if I=14, F=1. So I1=14-2*12= -10, which is wrong. So this option is incorrect.

Option B:
- Line 20: F = INT((I+6)/12). Hmm, adding 6 before dividing. Maybe this is to handle some rounding, but I'm not sure. Let's test with I=14: (14+6)=20, 20/12 is 1.666, INT gives 1. So F=1. Then I1 =14 - (1-1)*12=14. That would print 14 inches as 1 foot and 14 inches, which is 2 feet and 2 inches. That's wrong because 14 inches is 1 foot 2 inches. So this isn't correct.

Option C:
- Line 20: F = INT(I/15). Wait, why 15? That doesn't make sense because feet and inches are based on 12. So this is definitely wrong. For example, I=12, F=0, I1=12, which would incorrectly print 0 feet and 12 inches instead of 1 foot 0 inches.

Option D:
- Line 20: F = I/12. This would give a float, but we need the integer part. So for I=14, F=1.166, but in BASIC, without INT, it might not automatically take the integer part. Also, line 30: I1 = I - F*10. Wait, why 10? Should be 12. So this is incorrect because it's subtracting 10*F instead of 12*F. For I=14, F=1.166, I1=14 -1.666*10=14-16.66= negative, which is wrong.

Option E:
- Line 20: F=INT(I/10). Again, 10 instead of 12. So for I=12, F=1 (since 12/10 is 1.2, INT gives 1), but that's wrong because 12 inches is 1 foot. Wait, no, because F is supposed to be 1, so that part seems correct. But wait, I=12, F=1. Then I1=12 -1*10=2. So it would print 12 inches as 1 foot and 2 inches, which is wrong. Because 12 inches is exactly 1 foot, 0 inches. So this option is incorrect.

Option F:
- The code is a bit messed up with \O symbols, which might be typos. Line 20: F=INT(I/12), correct. Line 30: I1 = I - F*12. That's correct. Line 40 prints correctly. So this seems right, but the line numbers and syntax might have issues because of the \O symbols. Not sure if that's a typo in the option, but assuming it's a mistake, the logic is correct. But I'm not sure if this is a valid BASIC syntax because of the line numbers like 1\O, which might not be recognized. So maybe this isn't the intended correct answer.

Option G:
- Line 20: F=INT(I*12), which is wrong. Multiplying I by 12 would give a huge number. For I=14, F would be 168, which is way off. So definitely wrong.

Option H:
- Line 20: F=(I MOD 12). Wait, MOD gives the remainder. So F would be the remainder when I is divided by 12, which is the inches part, not the feet. For I=14, F=2, which is wrong because F should be 1. Then I1 = I - F =12, which is correct for inches, but F is wrong. So this option is incorrect.

Option I:
- Line 20: F=INT(I/12), correct. Line 30: I1=F*12 - I. Wait, that's I1 = 12F - I. Let's test I=14. F=1, I1=12-14=-2. That's negative, which is wrong. So this option is incorrect.

Option J:
- Line 20: F=I/12. So F is a float. Let's say I=14, F=1.166. Line 30: I1=I - F*12. So 14 - (1.166*12)=14-14=0. So I1=0. Then the print would say 14 inches = 1.166 feet and 0 inches. But F is not an integer. So the output would be incorrect because feet should be an integer. So this option is wrong.

So the correct logic should be:
- F = INT(I / 12)
- I1 = I - F * 12

Looking back, option F does this correctly, but the line numbers have \O which might be typos. Alternatively, maybe option A was close but had (F+1)*12 which was wrong. So perhaps option F is the intended correct answer, assuming the \O are just formatting issues and the code runs correctly.

Wait, looking again, option F's line 30 is I-F*12. So yes, correct. But the line numbers are 1\O, 2\O, etc. which might not be valid, but perhaps it's a typo in the question and the correct logic is there. Alternatively, perhaps option F isn't valid because of syntax errors, making it not the correct answer.

Wait, perhaps I missed an option. Let me recheck. Oh wait, option F has line 30 as I - F extasteriskcentered12. The '*' is probably a typo, but if it's I - F*12, then correct. But the line numbers have \O, which might mean it's line 10, 20, etc. Maybe it's a typo in the question, and the code is correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option F, but I'm not sure because of the syntax. Alternatively, perhaps the correct option isn't present, but looking again, option F seems correct in logic except for possible typos.

Wait, another thought: in option B, let's test with I=9 inches. F=INT((9+6)/12)=INT(15/12)=1. I1=9 - (1-1)*12=9-0=9. So it prints 9 inches as 1 foot and 9 inches, which is wrong because 9 inches is 0 feet and 9 inches. So option B is wrong.

Another test: I=86 inches. Correct conversion is 7 feet 2 inches (7*12=84, 86-84=2).

Looking at option F (if it's correct in logic), let's see:

F=INT(86/12)=7. I1=86 -7*12=86-84=2. So correct.

But in option F, line 30 is I - F*12, which is correct.

So the correct program should be option F, assuming the syntax errors are typos. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option F.

Wait, but looking at the options again, option F has code like 1\O, 2\O, etc., which might not be valid line numbers. So perhaps the answer is none of them, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is option F, but the line numbers are written as 1O, 2O, etc., which could be line 10, 20, etc. Maybe the \O is a typo, and it's meant to be 10, 20. So if line 10 is 1O, which is 10, then the code is correct.

So, after all this, I think option F is the correct answer.

To determine which BASIC program correctly converts inches to feet and inches, we need to ensure the program calculates the number of feet (F) and remaining inches (I1) accurately. The correct approach is:

1. **Calculate F**: Divide the total inches (I) by 12 and take the integer part using `INT(I/12)`.
2. **Calculate I1**: Subtract the total inches equivalent of F from I, i.e., `I1 = I - F*12`.
3. **Print the result**: Display the conversion in the format "I INCHES = F FEET I1 INCHES".

### Analysis of Each Option:

- **Option A**:  
  - Line 30: `I1 = I - (F+1)*12` is incorrect because it subtracts an extra 12 inches, leading to negative values for I1.  
  - **Incorrect**.

- **Option B**:  
  - Line 20: `F = INT((I+6)/12)` adds 6 inches before dividing, which is unnecessary and leads to incorrect results.  
  - **Incorrect**.

- **Option C**:  
  - Line 20: `F = INT(I/15)` uses 15 instead of 12, which is invalid for converting inches to feet.  
  - **Incorrect**.

- **Option D**:  
  - Line 20: `F = I/12` does not take the integer part, and line 30 subtracts `F*10` instead of `F*12`, which is incorrect.  
  - **Incorrect**.

- **Option E**:  
  - Line 20: `F = INT(I/10)` uses 10 instead of 12, which is invalid.  
  - **Incorrect**.

- **Option F**:  
  - Line 20: `F = INT(I/12)` correctly calculates the number of feet.  
  - Line 30: `I1 = I - F*12` correctly calculates the remaining inches.  
  - The logic is correct, but the line numbers (e.g., `1\O`, `2\O`) appear to have typos. Assuming these are valid line numbers (e.g., 10, 20), the program works.  
  - **Correct (assuming typos are resolved)**.

- **Option G**:  
  - Line 20: `F = INT(I*12)` multiplies I by 12, which is incorrect.  
  - **Incorrect**.

- **Option H**:  
  - Line 20: `F = (I MOD 12)` calculates the remainder instead of the number of feet.  
  - **Incorrect**.

- **Option I**:  
  - Line 30: `I1 = F*12 - I` subtracts I from `F*12`, which can result in negative values for I1.  
  - **Incorrect**.

- **Option J**:  
  - Line 20: `F = I/12` does not take the integer part, and line 30 subtracts `F*12` from I, which can result in incorrect floating-point values for F.  
  - **Incorrect**.

### Conclusion:
Option F is the only choice with the correct logic for converting inches to feet and inches, assuming the line numbers are valid (e.g., 10, 20, etc.) and the `\O` symbols are typos.
