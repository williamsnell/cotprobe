Okay, so I have this chemistry problem here about calculating the enthalpy change for the dissociation of HCl gas in water. Hmm, let me think through this step by step.

The reaction given is HCl(g) → H⁺(aq) + Cl⁻(aq). I remember that the enthalpy change of a reaction, ΔH°, is calculated using the heats of formation of the products and reactants. The formula I think is ΔH° = Σ ΔHf°(products) - Σ ΔHf°(reactants). Right, because it's the heat released or absorbed when forming products from reactants.

So the data provided are the heats of formation at 77°F. Let me jot those down:

HCl(g): ΔHf = -87.54 Btu/mole
H⁺(aq): ΔHf = 0 Btu/mole
Cl⁻(aq): ΔHf = -158.8 Btu/mole

Wait, wait. But wait, wait. Oh yeah, because in the reaction, HCl is the reactant, and H+ and Cl- are the products. So the reactant side is just HCl, which has a ΔHf of -87.54. The products are H+ and Cl-.

So applying the formula: ΔH° = [ΔHf(H⁺) + ΔHf(Cl⁻)] - [ΔHf(HCl)].

Plugging in the numbers: [0 + (-158.8)] - [(-87.54)]. 

Calculating that: (-158.8) - (-87.54) is the same as -158.8 + 87.54. Let me do the math. 158.8 minus 87.54 is 71.26, but since it's negative 158.8 plus 87.54, that's -71.26.

Wait, wait, no. Wait, because the calculation is (-158.8) - (-87.54) equals -158.8 + 87.54. Let me compute that. 158.8 minus 87.54 is 71.26, so the result is negative 71.26. So ΔH° is -71.26 Btu.

Looking at the options, option H is -71.26 Btu. So the answer should be H.

Wait, but let me double-check. Sometimes I get confused with the signs. The products are H+ and Cl-. Their formation enthalpies are 0 and -158.8. The reactant is HCl at -87.54.

So sum of products' ΔHf: 0 + (-158.8) = -158.8.

Sum of reactants' ΔHf: just HCl at -87.54.

So ΔH° = (-158.8) - (-87.54) = -158.8 + 87.54 = -71.26. Yep, that's correct. So the answer is H.

To calculate the enthalpy change (ΔH°) for the dissociation of gaseous hydrochloric acid in water, we use the formula:

\[
\Delta H^\circ = \Sigma \Delta H_f^\circ (\text{products}) - \Sigma \Delta H_f^\circ (\text{reactants})
\]

The reaction is:

\[
\text{HCl(g)} \rightarrow \text{H}^+(aq) + \text{Cl}^-(aq)
\]

The given heats of formation are:

- **HCl(g):** ΔHf = -87.54 Btu/mole  
- **H⁺(aq):** ΔHf = 0 Btu/mole  
- **Cl⁻(aq):** ΔHf = -158.8 Btu/mole  

Applying the formula:

1. **Sum of ΔHf° for products**:  
   \[
   \Delta H_f^\circ (\text{H}^+) + \Delta H_f^\circ (\text{Cl}^-) = 0 + (-158.8) = -158.8 \, \text{Btu}
   \]

2. **Sum of ΔHf° for reactants**:  
   \[
   \Delta H_f^\circ (\text{HCl}) = -87.54 \, \text{Btu}
   \]

3. **Calculate ΔH°**:  
   \[
   \Delta H^\circ = (-158.8) - (-87.54) = -158.8 + 87.54 = -71.26 \, \text{Btu}
   \]

Thus, the enthalpy change for the reaction is **-71.26 Btu**, which corresponds to option **H**.
