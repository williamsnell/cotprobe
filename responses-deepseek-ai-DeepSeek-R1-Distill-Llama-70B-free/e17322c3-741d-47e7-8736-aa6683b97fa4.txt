Question:

What roles does glucose play in cellmetabolism ?

Options:

A: Glucose is used to create cell membranes and is not involved in energy storage
B: Glucose is converted directly into nucleic acids for cell replication
C: Glucose serves only as a secondary energy source when fats and proteins are not available
D: Glucose cannot be stored in cells
E: Glucose is the primary source of energy for plant cells, but not for animal cells
F: Glucose serves as the primary source of energy for all cells, can be converted to glycogen for storage, and can be converted into fat for later use.
G: Glucose can only be converted into protein for cell structure
H: Glucose is only stored in the form of fat
I: Glucose is only used for energy production
J: Glucose is exclusively used to synthesize amino acids and proteins

Okay, so I have this question about glucose's roles in cell metabolism, and I need to pick the right answer from options A to J. Hmm, I remember that glucose is a pretty important molecule for cells. Let me think about what I know.

First, glucose is a sugar, right? And it's a primary energy source for cells. I think cells break it down to produce ATP, which is energy. Oh wait, that's through cellular respiration. So glucose is the main energy source. But wait, what about plants and animals? Oh, right, both use glucose. Plants make it through photosynthesis, and animals get it from food.

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one. Option A says glucose is used to create cell membranes. Wait, cell membranes are made of phospholipids and proteins, not glucose. So A is wrong.

Option B: Converted directly into nucleic acids. Nucleic acids like DNA and RNA are made of nucleotides, which include sugars, but glucose isn't directly converted into them. They use different sugars like deoxyribose and ribose. So B is incorrect.

Option C: Glucose is a secondary energy source. No, I think glucose is the primary source. Cells prefer glucose, and when it's low, they switch to fats. So C is wrong.

Option D: Glucose can't be stored. That's not right. In animals, glucose is stored as glycogen in the liver and muscles. Plants store it as starch. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Primary for plants but not animals. No, both use glucose as primary energy. So E is wrong.

Option F: Glucose is primary energy for all cells, converted to glycogen for storage, and into fat. That sounds right. Wait, glycogen is the storage form in animals, and if there's excess glucose, it can be converted to fat. So F seems correct.

Option G: Only converted to protein. No, glucose is mainly for energy and some storage, not directly into proteins. G is wrong.

Option H: Only stored as fat. No, because glycogen is another form. H is incorrect.

Option I: Only used for energy. Well, glucose can also be stored as glycogen or converted to fat, so I is wrong.

Option J: Only for amino acids and proteins. No, that's not right. Glucose isn't directly used for proteins. J is wrong.

So the correct answer should be F.

The correct answer is:

**F: Glucose serves as the primary source of energy for all cells, can be converted to glycogen for storage, and can be converted into fat for later use.**

This option accurately reflects the roles of glucose in cell metabolism. Glucose is the primary energy source for both plant and animal cells, and it can be stored as glycogen in animals or starch in plants. Excess glucose is converted into fat for long-term energy storage. The other options either misrepresent glucose's role or omit key aspects of its metabolism.

Answer: F
