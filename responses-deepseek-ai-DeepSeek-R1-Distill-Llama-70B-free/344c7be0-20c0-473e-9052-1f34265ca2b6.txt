Okay, so Kelly has a mystery number, and it's a factor of 38. I need to figure out which of the given options could be her number. Hmm, factors are numbers that divide into another without leaving a remainder. So I should probably list all the factors of 38 first.

Let me think, 38 is an even number, so I know 2 is a factor because it's divisible by 2. 38 divided by 2 is 19. Oh wait, 19 is a prime number, right? So the factors of 38 are 1, 2, 19, and 38. 

Now looking at the options provided: A is 15, B is 7, C is 8, D is 4, E is 5, F is 10, G is 6, H is 3, I is 12, J is 2. From my list, the factors are 1, 2, 19, 38. So checking the options, J is 2, which is in the factors. Are there any others? Let me double-check each option.

Option A: 15. Does 15 divide 38? 15 times 2 is 30, which is less than 38, and 15 times 3 is 45, which is too big. So no, 15 isn't a factor.

Option B: 7. 7 times 5 is 35, and 7 times 6 is 42. So 7 doesn't divide into 38 evenly.

Option C:8. 8 times 4 is 32, 8 times 5 is 40. So no, 8 isn't a factor.

Option D:4. 4 times 9 is 36, 4 times 10 is 40. So no, 4 doesn't divide 38 exactly.

Option E:5. 5 times 7 is 35, 5 times 8 is 40. So 5 isn't a factor either.

Option F:10. 10 times 3 is 30, 10 times 4 is 40. Nope, doesn't work.

Option G:6. 6 times 6 is 36, 6 times 7 is 42. So no.

Option H:3. Let me see, 3 times 12 is 36, 3 times 13 is 39. So 3 isn't a factor.

Option I:12. 12 times 3 is 36, 12 times 4 is 48. So no.

Option J:2. Yes, 2 is definitely a factor because 38 divided by 2 is 19. So J is the correct answer.

The factors of 38 are 1, 2, 19, and 38. Among the given options, only 2 (option J) is a factor of 38. 

Answer: J
