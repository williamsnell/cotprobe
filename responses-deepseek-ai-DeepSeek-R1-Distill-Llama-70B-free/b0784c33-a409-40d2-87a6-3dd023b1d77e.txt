Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this problem about determining the force required to raise a load using a power screw. Hmm, I remember that power screws are used in machinery to convert rotational motion into linear motion, like in a press or a jack. The question gives me a bunch of parameters, and I need to calculate the operating force.

Let me list out what's given:

- Load (W) = 3100 lbs
- Screw: 2.5 inches, triple threaded, square
- Collar: outer diameter 4.5 in, inner diameter 3.0 in
- Pitch (p) of thread = 0.5 in
- Operating force applied at radius (R) = 38 inches
- Coefficient of friction (μ) for both collar and threads is 0.2

Wait, so the screw is triple threaded. That means the number of threads (n) is 3, right? Because each thread is like a start, so having three threads increases the lead. Oh wait, lead is the distance the screw advances per revolution. For a square thread, the lead would be n times the pitch. Since the pitch is 0.5 in, the lead (L) is 3 * 0.5 = 1.5 inches.

But wait, for the torque calculations, I think the lead is important. Because torque relates to the force times the radius, but also depends on the thread's properties.

Wait, the formula for the torque required to raise the load on a power screw is T = (W * (d/2) * μ_mean) / (cos α) + (W * p * μ) / (π * d * n) )... No, maybe I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

I remember that the torque needed has two components: one due to the collar friction and another due to the thread friction.

So, the total torque T is the sum of the torque from the collar (T_collar) and the torque from the screw threads (T_threads).

So, T = T_collar + T_threads.

Each of these can be calculated separately.

Starting with the collar: The collar is a rotating member, so the frictional torque is μ times the normal force times the radius at which it's acting. Wait, no, the frictional torque is μ times the normal force times the radius of the collar's contact point.

Wait, the collar's normal force is the load W, right? Because the load is being supported by the collar. So the normal force N-collar is W.

The radius for the collar's friction is the average radius of the collar. But wait, the collar has an inner and outer diameter. So the inner diameter is 3.0 in, outer 4.5 in. So the radii are 1.5 and 2.25 inches. But for the friction torque, I think we use the mean radius. Or maybe the outside radius because the collar's contact is on the outside? Or perhaps the inside? Wait, I'm a bit confused.

Wait, the collar is fixed, and the screw rotates inside it. So the friction occurs between the screw and the collar. So the diameter of the screw that's in contact with the collar is the inner diameter of the collar, which is 3.0 inches. So the radius (r_collar) is 1.5 inches. So the torque due to collar friction is T_collar = μ * W * r_collar.

Wait, no, wait a second. The torque is the frictional force times the radius. The frictional force is μ times the normal force. So T_collar = μ * W * r_collar.

But wait, sometimes the formula I've seen writes it as T_collar = μ * W * D_collar / 2, where D_collar is the diameter. So that would be μ * W * (D_collar_inner / 2). Hmm. Yeah, that makes sense.

So for the collar, D_collar_inner is 3 in, so radius is 1.5 in. So T_collar = μ * W * r_collar = 0.2 * 3100 lbs * 1.5 in.

Let me do that calculation. 0.2 * 3100 = 620, then 620 * 1.5 = 930 in-lbs. Wait, but torque is in some unit. The problem is, the operating force is applied at a radius of 38 inches, so the torque will be in inch-pounds, and we'll need to relate the operating force (which is a force) to the torque.

But wait, the operating force is the force applied tangentially at radius R, so T_operating = F * R. Because torque is force times the lever arm.

So the total torque needed is T_total = T_collar + T_threads.

I need to find T_threads as well. For the screw threads, the frictional torque arises from the screw's own thread friction. The formula I remember is T_threads = (W * μ * p) / (π * d) ), but I'm not sure about the exact formula.

Wait, another approach: The torque due to the thread friction can be found by considering the lead, the pitch, and the angle of the thread. Alternatively, I think the torque due to the screw thread friction is given by T_threads = (W * μ * d) / (2 * cos α), but I might be mixing things up.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the concept of the equivalent frictional torque for the thread. For a screw thread, the torque required to overcome friction is given by T = (W * μ * r) / (cos α), where r is the radius at which the friction acts, and alpha is the thread angle. But I'm not entirely confident.

Alternatively, I remember a formula: T = (μ * W * d) / (2 * (1 + μ cot α)) ), but that seems a bit more complex.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to model the screw as a inclined plane. The screw thread can be considered as a series of inclined planes wrapped around the screw. The lead is the distance advanced per revolution, and the pitch is the distance between adjacent threads.

Wait, for a square thread, the thread angle is such that tan α = (pitch)/(π*d). Because the lead for a single thread is p, but since it's triple threaded, the lead L is n*p, which is 3*0.5=1.5 in. So for a single thread, p=0.5, but for this screw, the lead is 1.5 inches.

Wait, but the formula for the thread angle α is tan α = (lead)/(π*d), where d is the nominal diameter of the screw.

Wait, but what is the nominal diameter here? The screw's major diameter (the outer diameter) is the same as the inner diameter of the collar, right? Because the collar's inner diameter is 3.0 in, so the screw's major diameter is 3.0 in, making the radius r = 1.5 in.

So tan α = lead / (π * d) = 1.5 / (π * 3) = 1.5/(9.4248) ≈ 0.159. So α ≈ arctan(0.159) ≈ 9 degrees or so. But since the coefficient of friction is given, maybe we can find the torque without explicitly calculating α.

Wait, perhaps I should use the formula for torque due to thread friction, which is T_threads = (μ * W * r) / cos α, where r is the screw's radius, and α is the thread angle.

But since α is small, cos α is approximately 1, but that might not be precise enough. Alternatively, perhaps a different approach.

Wait, another formula I found in my notes is the torque required to overcome friction in the threads is T = (μ * W * d) / (2 * (1 + μ cot α)) ), but I'm not sure if that's applicable here. Alternatively, perhaps the torque can be calculated based on the mean diameter of the screw.

Wait, maybe a better way is to compute the torque due to the thread friction as T = (μ * W * d) / (2 * sin(α/2)) ), but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, I think the torque due to the thread friction can be determined by considering the helix angle of the thread. For a square thread, the helix angle is given by tan θ = (lead)/(π*d). So θ = arctan( (1.5) / (π * 3) ) = arctan(1.5/(9.4248)) ≈ arctan(0.159) ≈ 9 degrees.

Then, the torque due to thread friction is T = (μ * W * r) / (cos θ), where r is the radius of the screw.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck on the exact formula. Maybe I should refer to the standard formula for the torque required in a power screw.

After some thinking, I remember that the torque due to the screw thread friction is given by T = (μ * W * d) / (2 * cos α), where d is the nominal diameter, and α is the thread angle.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Let me think of it differently. The torque needed to overcome friction in the threads can be calculated using the formula:

T = (μ * W * p) / (π * d)

Wait, because the pitch is the distance per thread, and there are n threads, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, the torque due to the thread friction is T = (μ * W * (p / (π * d)) ) * (1 / sin α) )... Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck.

Wait, perhaps I should find the torque due to the thread friction as T = (μ * W * r) / (cos α), where r is the radius of the screw, and α is the angle of the thread.

Since α is small, cos α is approximately 1, so T ≈ μ * W * r.

Wait, but that can't be right because then T would be 0.2 * 3100 * 1.5 = 930 in-lbs, which is the same as the collar torque. That seems high, but let's proceed.

Alternatively, perhaps another approach. The torque required due to the threads is T = (W * μ * d) / (2 * cos α) ), where d is the diameter.

But again, without knowing the exact formula, I'm a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for a standard formula.

Wait, perhaps I can find the torque due to the threads using the formula:

T = (μ * W * r) / (1 - μ * tan θ)

Wait, I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the torque is related to the lead and the coefficient of friction.

Wait, another thought: The torque required to raise the load is also influenced by the mechanical advantage of the screw. The ideal torque without friction would be T_ideal = (W * p) / (π * d), where p is the pitch. But since we have friction, we need to add the torque losses due to friction.

Wait, the ideal torque (without any friction) is when you have T_ideal = (W * d) / (2 * L), where L is the lead. Because the lead is the distance moved per revolution, so each revolution does work W * L. The torque is F * R, but F is W for a screw, so T_ideal = W * (d/2) / (L / (2π)) )? Hmm, I might be mixing up terms.

Alternatively, perhaps the torque without friction is T_ideal = (W * d) / (2 * lead) * efficiency. But I'm not making progress here.

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula that includes both collar friction and thread friction. The total torque T is the sum of the torque from the collar and the torque from the threads.

I think the formula for T is:

T = [ (μ * W * D_collar_inner / 2 ) ] + [ (μ * W * p) / (π * D_screw) ) ]

Wait, that makes sense because:

- The first term is the torque from the collar, which is μ * W * (D_collar_inner/2). Because D_collar_inner is the diameter of the screw, so radius is D/2.

- The second term is the torque from the thread friction. The frictional force on the threads is μ * W, and the moment arm is p/(π D_screw), because for each thread, the pitch relates to the circumference.

Wait, no. Wait, the pitch is the distance between threads, but the circumference is π * D_screw. So the ratio p/(π D_screw) would be the fraction of the circumference that's the pitch. Not sure if that's correct.

Alternatively, the torque due to the threads is (μ * W) * (p / (2 * π)), because the pitch is the lead per thread, and for a single thread, the lead is p. So the mean diameter is D_screw, so the circumference is π D_screw. The pitch would correspond to a fraction of that circumference, so the effective lever arm for the torque would be p/(2 π) * D_screw/2 ?

Hmm, perhaps. Let me try.

So, torque due to threads would be (μ * W) * (p * D_screw) / (2 * π * 2) )? Not sure.

Wait, another approach: The friction force on the thread is f = μ * W. The torque is f multiplied by the distance from the center, which is the radius. But the friction acts along the thread's surface. The thread's helix can be unwrapped into a straight line, and the effective lever arm for the friction would be the radius times tan(theta), where theta is the thread angle.

Wait, maybe the torque due to thread friction is f * r * tan(theta), but I'm not certain.

Wait, perhaps the torque due to thread friction is (μ * W) * (r / cos(theta)), where theta is the thread angle, and r is the radius. Since theta is small, cos(theta) is approximately 1, so torque ≈ μ * W * r.

So then T_threads ≈ μ * W * r. So with μ=0.2, W=3100, r=1.5 in, that would be 0.2 * 3100 * 1.5 = 930 in-lbs.

So then the total torque T = T_collar + T_threads = 930 + 930 = 1860 in-lbs.

But wait, that seems very high. Because the collar alone is 930, and the threads another 930, making 1860 in-lbs.

But then, the operating force F is applied at a radius R of 38 inches. So the torque provided by the operating force is F * R.

So F = T_total / R.

So F = 1860 in-lbs / 38 in = approximately 48.947 lbs.

Wait, but that's not matching any of the options given. The options are in the 55 to 100 range. So I must have made a mistake.

Hmm, perhaps I calculated the torque incorrectly.

Wait, let me go back. Maybe I mixed up the collar's inner diameter with the screw's diameter.

Wait, the collar has an inner diameter of 3.0 in, so the screw's major diameter is 3.0 in. So the radius is 1.5 in. So T_collar = μ * W * r_collar = 0.2 * 3100 * 1.5 = 930 in-lbs.

T_threads: I'm not confident about that 930 figure. Maybe the thread torque is much smaller.

Wait, perhaps the correct formula for T_threads is (μ * W * p) / (π * D_screw). So p=0.5 in, D_screw=3.0 in.

So T_threads = (0.2 * 3100 * 0.5) / (π * 3) ) 

Let me compute that: numerator is 0.2 *3100 =620, 620 *0.5=310. Denominator is π *3≈9.4248. So 310 /9.4248 ≈32.88 in-lbs.

So T_threads ≈32.88 in-lbs.

Then T_total = T_collar + T_threads =930 +32.88≈962.88 in-lbs.

Then F = T_total / R = 962.88 /38 ≈25.33 lbs. Still not matching any options.

Wait, but that's way too low. The options are like 55-100 lbs. So I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I got the formula wrong. Let me think again. Maybe the torque due to the screw threads is calculated using the lead instead of the pitch.

Because lead is the distance the screw moves per revolution, which for triple threads is 1.5 inches.

So perhaps the correct formula for T_threads is (μ * W * lead) / (2 * π).

Wait, let me try that. Lead L=1.5 in.

T_threads = (μ * W * L ) / (2 * π ) = (0.2 * 3100 *1.5 ) / (6.2832) 

Calculate numerator: 0.2*3100=620, 620*1.5=930.

930 /6.2832≈148 in-lbs.

So T_threads≈148 in-lbs.

So T_total = T_collar + T_threads =930 +148=1078 in-lbs.

Then F = 1078 /38 ≈28.31 lbs. Still not matching options.

Hmm, perhaps I'm using the wrong approach. Maybe I should model the screw as an inclined plane and compute the torque accordingly.

The formula for torque when considering friction is T = F * R, where F is the force applied, and R is the radius where the force is applied.

But to find F, we need to relate it to the torque required.

Alternatively, maybe the total torque is the sum of the torque due to the collar and the torque due to the thread friction.

Wait, let me think about the torque due to the thread friction more carefully. The frictional force on the threads is f = μ * W. This force acts at a certain distance from the center of the screw, which is the radius of the screw (1.5 inches). So the torque due to this friction is f * r = μ * W * r.

So T_threads = μ * W * r =0.2 *3100 *1.5=930 in-lbs.

So T_collar is also 930 in-lbs, so T_total=1860 in-lbs.

Then F = T_total / R =1860 /38 ≈48.95 lbs.

But none of the options are around 49. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in how I'm calculating T_collar.

Wait, maybe the collar's frictional torque is calculated differently. Maybe the radius is not the screw's radius, but the
