Okay, so I've got this problem here about Teddy's Auto Parts renting a warehouse. I need to figure out the total cost for occupancy for one year. Hmm, let's see. The lease says they have to pay an annual rent of $2 per square foot, plus taxes and insurance. 

Alright, let's break this down. The warehouse is 62,500 square feet, so the rent would be 62,500 multiplied by $2. Let me calculate that: 62,500 times 2 is 125,000. So the base rent is $125,000 a year.

But wait, there's more. There are taxes and insurance to add. The taxes are $12,000 a year, and the insurance is $400. So I need to add those two to the base rent. Let's add them up: 12,000 plus 400 equals 12,400. 

Now, I add that to the base rent. So the total cost is the base rent plus taxes and insurance. That's 125,000 plus 12,400. Let me do that math: 125,000 + 12,400 equals 137,400. 

Looking at the options, I see option I is $137,400. So the answer must be I.

The total occupancy cost is calculated by adding the annual rent, taxes, and insurance. 

1. **Annual Rent**:  
   Warehouse size = 62,500 square feet.  
   Rent per square foot = $2.  
   Annual rent = 62,500 Ã— $2 = $125,000.

2. **Taxes and Insurance**:  
   Taxes = $12,000/year.  
   Insurance = $400/year.  
   Total taxes and insurance = $12,000 + $400 = $12,400.

3. **Total Cost**:  
   Total cost = Annual rent + Taxes and insurance.  
   Total cost = $125,000 + $12,400 = $137,400.

The correct answer is **I**.
