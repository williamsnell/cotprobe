Okay, so I have this problem: I need to find how many real roots the polynomial 2x^5 + 8x - 7 has. The options are from A to J, with various numbers. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my calculus, but I remember something about the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra and maybe using derivatives to find the number of real roots.

Wait, wait, let's think. The polynomial is of degree 5, right? So the highest power is x^5. According to the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, a degree n polynomial has exactly n roots in the complex plane, counting multiplicities. But the question is about real roots. So the number of real roots can't exceed 5, and the rest would be complex.

But how do I find the number of real roots? I remember that Descartes' Rule of Signs can give the maximum number of positive and negative real roots. Let me try that. 

Looking at the polynomial 2x^5 +8x -7. The coefficients are 2, 0, 0, 0, 8, -7. Wait, wait, no, the polynomial is 2x^5 +8x -7, so the coefficients are 2 for x^5, then 0 for x^4, x^3, x^2, 8 for x, and -7 as the constant term.

Descartes' Rule says that the number of positive real roots is either equal to the number of sign changes in the sequence of coefficients or less than that by an even number. Let's count the sign changes here. The coefficients go 2 (positive), then 0s don't count, then 8 (positive), then -7 (negative). Wait, so between 8 and -7, there's one sign change. So according to Descartes, there is exactly 1 positive real root. Because 1 minus an even number can't be negative, so only 1 positive root.

Now, for the negative real roots. To apply Descartes, I substitute x with -x in the polynomial and see the sign changes. Let's do that:

2(-x)^5 +8(-x) -7 = -2x^5 -8x -7.

Wait, the polynomial becomes -2x^5 -8x -7. So the coefficients are -2, 0, 0, 0, -8, -7. Now, counting sign changes: from -2 to next non-zero is -8, same sign. Then from -8 to -7, same sign. So no sign changes. So according to Descartes, zero negative real roots.

So from Descartes' Rule, we have exactly 1 positive real root and 0 negative real roots. So total real roots would be 1. But wait, could there be more? Because sometimes Descartes gives the maximum but the actual could be less, but wait no, in this case, since the number of sign changes is 1, it must be exactly 1 positive root.

But wait, maybe I should double-check using calculus. Let's compute the derivative to see the behavior of the function.

The function is f(x) = 2x^5 +8x -7.

The derivative f’(x) = 10x^4 +8.

Since x^4 is always non-negative, 10x^4 is >=0, adding 8 makes f’(x) >=8, which is always positive. So the function is strictly increasing everywhere. That means the function can cross the x-axis only once. Because if it's always increasing, it can't turn around and cross again.

So that confirms that there's exactly one real root. Because a strictly increasing function will go from negative infinity to positive infinity, crossing the x-axis exactly once if it does so at all. 

Wait, but does it cross? Let me check the limits. As x approaches positive infinity, 2x^5 dominates, so f(x) approaches positive infinity. As x approaches negative infinity, 2x^5 (since 5 is odd) approaches negative infinity. So the function goes from -inf to +inf, and since it's strictly increasing, it must cross the x-axis exactly once. So yes, one real root.

So the correct answer is J: One.
</think>

To determine the number of real roots of the polynomial \( f(x) = 2x^5 + 8x - 7 \), we can use a combination of Descartes' Rule of Signs and calculus.

### Step 1: Apply Descartes' Rule of Signs
1. **Positive real roots**: The coefficients of \( f(x) \) are \( 2, 0, 0, 0, 8, -7 \). There is 1 sign change (from \( +8 \) to \( -7 \)), so there is exactly 1 positive real root.
2. **Negative real roots**: Substitute \( x \) with \( -x \) to get \( f(-x) = -2x^5 - 8x - 7 \). The coefficients are \( -2, 0, 0, 0, -8, -7 \), and there are no sign changes. Thus, there are 0 negative real roots.

From Descartes' Rule, the polynomial has exactly 1 real root.

### Step 2: Confirm with Calculus
The derivative of \( f(x) \) is \( f'(x) = 10x^4 + 8 \). Since \( x^4 \geq 0 \), \( f'(x) \geq 8 \), which is always positive. This means \( f(x) \) is strictly increasing everywhere.

A strictly increasing function can cross the x-axis at most once. Additionally:
- As \( x \to \infty \), \( f(x) \to \infty \) (dominated by \( 2x^5 \)).
- As \( x \to -\infty \), \( f(x) \to -\infty \) (since the leading term \( 2x^5 \) is odd).

Thus, \( f(x) \) must cross the x-axis exactly once, confirming that there is exactly 1 real root.

### Final Answer
The polynomial \( 2x^5 + 8x - 7 \) has exactly one real root.

J: One
