Okay, so I've got this problem here about two libraries and the number of books they have. The question is asking me to estimate how many more books the Mills Library has than the Springvale Library. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I'll look at the numbers given. Mills has 1,007,199 books, and Springvale has 907,082. I need to find the difference between these two numbers. But the question says to estimate, so I don't need to calculate the exact difference. That means I can round the numbers to make the subtraction easier.

Let me write down the numbers to visualize them better. Mills: 1,007,199 and Springvale: 907,082. Hmm, okay, so both are in the millions, but Mills has a bit more. Wait, no, actually, wait. Mills is just over a million, and Springvale is about 900 thousand. So the difference is going to be around 100,000 books, I think.

But to get a better estimate, I'll round each number. For Mills, 1,007,199 is very close to 1,000,000. Maybe I can round it up to 1,010,000 for easier calculation. As for Springvale, 907,082 is nearly 910,000, so I'll round that down to 900,000. Wait, no. Actually, if I'm estimating, maybe I should round both to the nearest hundred thousand to make it simple.

So, Mills is approximately 1,000,000 and Springvale is approximately 900,000. Subtracting those gives me 100,000. But wait, let me check the exact numbers again because sometimes the digits after the rounding point can change the estimate a bit.

Mills: 1,007,199. Breaking it down, that's 1 million plus 7 thousand plus 199. So it's 1,007,199. Springvale is 907,082, which is 900 thousand plus 7 thousand and 82. So when I subtract, it's (1,000,000 + 7,199) minus (900,000 + 7,082). Let me compute this step by step.

Subtracting the millions: 1,000,000 - 900,000 = 100,000. Now the smaller parts: 7,199 - 7,082. Let's compute that. 7,199 minus 7,000 is 199, and then subtract 82 more. So 199 -82 = 117. So the total difference is 100,000 + 117 = 100,117 books.

Wait, but the options don't have 100,117. Let me look at the options again. The options are A:200k, B:20k, C:120k, D:10k, E:70k, F:90k, G:100k, H:50k, I:8k, J:80k.

So the exact difference is about 100,117, which is closest to option G:100,000. But wait, maybe I should consider that when estimating, sometimes the numbers are rounded differently. For example, if I round Mills to 1,000,000 and Springvale to 907,000, then the difference is 93,000. Oh wait, no, wait: 1,007,199 is 7,199 above 1,000,000, and 907,082 is 7,082 above 900,000. So when I subtract, it's (1,000,000 +7,199) - (900,000 +7,082) = (1,000,000 -900,000) + (7,199 -7,082) = 100,000 + 117 =100,117. So yeah, that's right.

But the options include 100k (G), which is the closest. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects me to round each number to the nearest hundred thousand, which would be 1,000,000 and 900,000, giving a difference of 100,000. So G is the correct answer.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes, when the numbers are close to the rounding points, you have to decide whether to round up or down. Mills is 1,007k, which is just 7k over a million, so maybe it's better to round it to 1,000,000. Springvale is 907k, which is just 7k over 900k, so I can also round that to 900,000. So again, the difference estimate is 100k.

Therefore, the best estimate is 100,000 books, which is option G.

To estimate how many more books the Mills Library has than the Springvale Library, we start with the given numbers: Mills has 1,007,199 books, and Springvale has 907,082 books. The goal is to find the difference between these two numbers.

First, we round the numbers to simplify the calculation:
- Mills Library: 1,007,199 is approximately 1,000,000.
- Springvale Library: 907,082 is approximately 900,000.

Subtracting these rounded values gives:
\[
1,000,000 - 900,000 = 100,000
\]

To refine the estimate, we consider the exact difference:
\[
1,007,199 - 907,082 = 100,117
\]

This exact difference is very close to 100,000. Among the provided options, the closest match is **100,000 books**.

Thus, the best estimate is **G: 100,000 books**.
