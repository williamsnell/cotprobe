Question:

Alice has 8 buckets. Each bucket has t tennis balls in it. There are a total of 56 tennis balls in the buckets. Which number sentence shows how to find, t, the number of tennis balls in each bucket?

Options:

A: 56 - t = 8
B: t ÷ 8 = 56
C: t + 8 = 56
D: 8 × t = 56
E: 8 + t = 56
F: t - 8 = 56
G: 8 ÷ t = 56
H: 56 + t = 8

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this math problem here. Let me read it carefully. Alice has 8 buckets, and each bucket has t tennis balls. The total number of tennis balls is 56. I need to find which number sentence correctly represents how to find t, the number of tennis balls in each bucket.

Hmm, let's break it down. So there are 8 buckets, each with the same number of tennis balls, which is t. The total is 56. I think this is a multiplication problem because when you have equal groups, you multiply the number of groups by the number in each group to get the total.

So, if each bucket has t balls and there are 8 buckets, then the total should be 8 multiplied by t. In equation form, that would be 8 * t = 56. So I'm looking for an option that shows 8 multiplied by t equals 56.

Looking at the options now:

Option A: 56 - t = 8. That doesn't make sense because subtracting t from 56 wouldn't give 8. That would mean t is 48, but let me check—no, that's not the right approach here.

Option B: t ÷ 8 = 56. Wait, if you divide t by 8 and get 56, then t would be 56 * 8, which is 448. But that's way more than the total given. So that's not right.

Option C: t + 8 = 56. Oh, adding t and 8 gives 56. So t would be 48. But wait, that would mean if each bucket has 48 balls, 8 buckets would have 384 balls, which is way more than 56. So that's wrong.

Option D: 8 × t = 56. Yes, this looks right. Because 8 times t equals 56, so solving for t would give t=7. That makes sense because 8 buckets with 7 balls each is 56 total.

Option E: 8 + t = 56. This is similar to option C. Solving gives t=48, which as I thought earlier, leads to a much larger total than 56. So no.

Option F: t - 8 = 56. That would mean t is 64, which again, way too high. So not correct.

Option G: 8 ÷ t = 56. Dividing 8 by t to get 56 would mean t is 8/56 = 1/7, which doesn't make sense because you can't have a fraction of a ball in each bucket in this context. So that's wrong.

Option H: 56 + t = 8. Adding t to 56 gives 8, which would mean t is -48. Negative tennis balls don't exist, so this is impossible.

So the correct equation is 8 multiplied by t equals 56, which is option D.

The correct number sentence is 8 × t = 56, which corresponds to option D.
