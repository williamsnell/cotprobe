Okay, so I need to figure out the annual interest rate Mrs. Reynolds paid for her carpeting purchase. Let's see, she bought $450 worth of carpeting with an easy payment plan. The plan requires a $70 down payment, and the balance is paid in 12 monthly payments of $35 each. 

First, I should understand the total cost she's paying. The down payment is $70, and then there are 12 payments of $35. So the total amount she's paying overall is 70 plus (12 times 35). Let me calculate that: 12 times 35 is 420, plus 70 is 490. So she's paying $490 in total for a $450 carpet.

Wait, but the question is about the interest rate. So I think I need to calculate the interest she's paying and then find the annual rate. The total paid is $490, and the price of the carpet is $450. So the extra $40 must be the interest. Hmm, but wait, is it that simple? Because she paid $70 down, so the amount she financed is 450 minus 70, which is 380 dollars. 

So she's borrowing $380, and she's paying back 12 monthly payments of $35 each, which totals 35 *12 = 420. So the interest she's paying is 420 - 380 = $40. So she's paying $40 interest on a principal of $380 over a year. 

But wait, calculating the interest rate. The interest is $40 on $380. So the interest rate would be 40 / 380. Let me compute that. 40 divided by 380 equals approximately 0.10526, which is about 10.526%. But wait, that's the simple interest rate over one year. However, because she's paying in monthly installments, maybe I should consider the effective interest rate using the amortization method or something like that.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is expecting me to calculate the interest as a percentage of the principal. Let me think again. The principal is $380. She pays 12 monthly payments of $35 each. So each payment is part principal and part interest. But since the payments are equal, it's an installment loan, and the interest is calculated differently.

Wait, but maybe the question is simpler. The total payment is $490 for a $450 item, so the total interest is $40. But when calculating the interest rate, it's based on the financed amount. So the interest is $40 on $380, which is 40/380 = 10.526% per year. But that doesn't match any of the options given. The options start at 15% and go up, so maybe I'm missing something.

Wait a minute, perhaps I'm not considering the time value of money correctly. Because she doesn't pay all $380 upfront but over 12 months. So the actual interest might be higher because the payments are made monthly. Hmm, this is getting a bit complicated.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate the APR using the formula for installment loans. The APR can be calculated using the formula:

APR = (2 * n * I) / (P * (n +1))

Wait, I'm not sure if that's the right formula. Alternatively, another approach is to recognize that this is a simple interest loan, but the payments are made in installments. Each payment includes both principal and interest.

Let me try to break down the payments. The amount financed is $380, and each monthly payment is $35. Let's compute the interest for each period.

But maybe that's too time-consuming. Alternatively, I can use the formula for the interest rate in installment loans.

The formula for the monthly payment (PMT) on an installment loan is:

PMT = (P * r) / (1 - (1 + r)^-n)

Where:
PMT is the monthly payment,
P is the principal amount,
r is the monthly interest rate,
n is the number of payments.

We can rearrange this to solve for r. But since I don't have the value of r, I'll need to compute it iteratively or use an approximation method.

Given that:
PMT = $35
P = $380
n = 12

We can plug these into the formula and solve for r.

So, 35 = (380 * r) / (1 - (1 + r)^-12 )

Hmm, let's try to compute this. Let me rearrange the equation:

35 * (1 - (1 + r)^-12 ) = 380 * r

Divide both sides by 380:

(35/380) * (1 - (1 + r)^-12 ) = r

35/380 is approximately 0.092105.

So 0.092105 * [1 - (1 + r)^-12 ] = r

This looks like it's going to require trial and error. Let's make an initial guess for r.

Let me try r = 0.015 (1.5% per month). Then:

1 + r = 1.015
(1.015)^-12 ≈ 0.8874
1 - 0.8874 = 0.1126

Left side: 0.092105 * 0.1126 ≈ 0.01039

Compare to r (0.015). 0.01039 < 0.015, so the left side is less than r. So the actual r must be lower than 0.015.

Wait, no. Because if at r=0.015, LHS is 0.01039, which is less than 0.015. So we need a smaller r.

Wait, but perhaps I should think again. Let me try r=0.01 (1%).

(1.01)^-12 ≈ 0.8874? Wait, no, (1.01)^12 is approximately 1.1268, so (1.01)^-12 ≈ 0.8874.

Wait, same as before. So at r=0.01:

LHS = 0.092105 * (1 - 0.8874) = 0.092105 * 0.1126 ≈ 0.01039

Which is higher than r=0.01 (0.01). So the equation at r=0.01 is 0.01039 = 0.01 → 0.01039 > 0.01, so we need to find where LHS equals r.

Wait, perhaps we can set up the equation to solve for r numerically.

Let me make a table of possible r values.

Let me try r=0.009 (0.9% per month):

(1.009)^-12 ≈ 1/(1.009)^12. Let me compute that.

(1.009)^12 ≈ e^(12 * ln(1.009)).

ln(1.009) ≈ 0.00895, so 12*0.00895 ≈ 0.1074. e^0.1074 ≈ 1.1137. So (1.009)^12 ≈ 1.1137 → (1.009)^-12 ≈ 1/1.1137 ≈ 0.8976.

So 1 - 0.8976 = 0.1024.

LHS: 0.092105 * 0.1024 ≈ 0.00943.

Compare to r=0.009: 0.00943 > 0.009 → So LHS > r, which means we need a larger r.

Wait, because we have 0.00943 = 0.009 → difference is 0.00043. So perhaps try r=0.0095.

r=0.0095:

(1.0095)^12 ≈ ?

Alternatively, perhaps I can approximate it. Let's compute (1.0095)^12:

Each month's rate is 0.95%, so after 12 months, it's (1.0095)^12.

Using the formula for compound interest:

Approximate using the rule that (1 + r)^n ≈ e^(n*r) when r is small.

So ln(1.0095) ≈ 0.00945. So 12 * 0.00945 = 0.1134. e^0.1134 ≈ 1.120.

So (1.0095)^12 ≈ 1.120 → (1.0095)^-12 ≈ 1/1.120 ≈ 0.8929.

1 - 0.8929 = 0.1071.

LHS: 0.092105 * 0.1071 ≈ 0.00986.

Compare to r=0.0095: 0.00986 > 0.0095 → So LHS > r. So we need a higher r.

Wait, but when r increases, (1 + r)^-12 decreases, so 1 - (1 + r)^-12 increases, so LHS increases as r increases. So when we have LHS higher than r, maybe we need a higher r. Wait, let's think again.

Wait, when r increases, (1 + r)^-12 decreases → 1 - (1 + r)^-12 increases → So the term [1 - (1 + r)^-12 ] increases, which makes LHS (0.092105 * [ ]) increase. So as r increases, LHS increases.

Wait, but the right side is r. So the equation is 0.092105*(1 - v) = r, where v is (1 + r)^-12.

We can plot this function. Let's try r=0.01 (1%):

v = (1.01)^-12 ≈ 0.8874 → 1 - v = 0.1126 → LHS = 0.092105 * 0.1126 ≈ 0.01039 → equation becomes 0.01039 = 0.01 → LHS > r.

At r=0.01, LHS=0.01039 > 0.01 → So we need to increase r to make LHS equal to r. Because as r increases, LHS increases. Wait, but that can't be right because we have 0.01039 > 0.01. So perhaps I'm getting this wrong.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider that at r=0.01, LHS is 0.01039, which is higher than r=0.01. So the equation is LHS = r, so if for r=0.01, LHS is 0.01039, which is higher than 0.01, we need a lower r, because at lower r, LHS is lower.

Wait, let me correct. At a lower r, the (1 + r)^-12 is higher, so 1 - (1 + r)^-12 is lower, so LHS is lower. So perhaps I should try lower r.

Wait, let's try r=0.008:

(1.008)^12 → ln(1.008)≈0.007968 → 12 * 0.007968≈0.0956 → e^0.0956≈1.100 → (1.008)^12≈1.100 → (1.008)^-12≈0.9091.

So 1 - 0.9091 = 0.0909.

LHS: 0.092105 * 0.0909 ≈ 0.00837.

Compare to r=0.008: 0.00837 < 0.008 → So LHS < r. So we need r between 0.008 and 0.009.

At r=0.0085 (0.85%):

(1.0085)^12 → let me approximate.

ln(1.0085)≈0.00847 → 12 * 0.00847≈0.1016 → e^0.1016≈1.1068 → (1.0085)^12≈1.1068 → (1.0085)^-12≈0.897.

1 - 0.897 = 0.103.

LHS: 0.092105 * 0.103 ≈ 0.00948.

Compare to r=0.0085: 0.00948 > 0.0085 → So LHS > r. So the actual r is between 0.008 and 0.0085.

Let me try r=0.00825 (0.825%).

Compute (1.00825)^12:

ln(1.00825)≈0.00818 → 12 * 0.00818≈0.0982 → e^0.0982≈1.103.

So (1.00825)^12≈1.103 → (1.00825)^-12≈0.905.

1 - 0.905 = 0.095.

LHS: 0.092105 * 0.095 ≈ 0.00875.

Compare to r=0.00825: 0.00875 < 0.00825? No, 0.00875 is 0.875%, which is higher than 0.825% (r=0.00825). Wait, no, 0.00875 is 0.875%, which is higher than 0.00825 (0.825%). So LHS is 0.00875 > r=0.00825 → So we need a higher r.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

We have the equation: 0.092105 * [1 - (1 + r)^-12 ] = r.

We're trying to find r where this holds.

Let me make a table:

r | (1+r)^-12 | 1 - (1+r)^-12 | LHS=0.092105 * (last column)
0.008 → 0.9091 → 0.0909 → 0.00837 → 0.00837 < 0.008 → LHS < r
0.0085 → 0.897 → 0.103 → 0.00948 → 0.00948 > 0.0085 → LHS > r
0.00825 → Let's compute more accurately.

Wait, perhaps using linear interpolation between r=0.008 and r=0.0085.

At r=0.008, LHS=0.00837 < 0.008 → difference is 0.008 - 0.00837 = -0.00037.

At r=0.0085, LHS=0.00948 > 0.0085 → 0.00948 - 0.0085 = +0.00098.

We need LHS = r. So we can set up the equation between these two points.

The difference in r is 0.0005 (from 0.008 to 0.0085).

The change in (LHS - r) is from -0.00037 to +0.00098, which is a change of 0.00135 over 0.0005 increase in r.

We need to find the r where LHS - r = 0. So starting from r=0.008, where LHS - r = -0.00037.

We need to cover 0.00037 to reach zero. The rate of change is 0.00135 per 0.0005 r.

So the fraction is 0.00037 / 0.00135 ≈ 0.274.

So r ≈ 0.008 + 0.274 * 0.0005 ≈ 0.008 + 0.000137 ≈ 0.008137 or 0.8137%.

But wait, that's the monthly rate. So the annual rate would be 0.008137 * 12 ≈ 0.09766 or 9.766%. But that's lower than any of the options provided (the lowest option is 15%). So this can't be right. Am I making a mistake here?

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question. Maybe the interest isn't calculated as I thought. Let me go back.

The total amount she paid is $490 for a $450 item. So the total interest is $40. But perhaps the way the interest is calculated is as a flat rate, not considering the time value.

Wait, if the interest is $40 on the principal of $450, then the interest rate would be (40/450)*100 ≈ 8.89%. But that's still lower than the options given.

Alternatively, maybe the interest is calculated on the amount financed, which is 450 -70 = 380. So 40/380 ≈ 10.526%. But again, that's about 10.5%, which doesn't match the options.

Wait, perhaps the interest is calculated differently, maybe with each payment including interest on the remaining balance, which would make the effective APR higher.

Wait, let me try another approach. Let's calculate the total interest paid, then determine the APR.

Total amount paid: 70 + (35 *12) = 70 + 420 = 490.

Total interest: 490 - 450 = 40.

But the amount financed is 450 -70 = 380.

So the interest is $40 on $380 over 12 months.

If it's simple interest, then the rate would be (40 / 380) / 1 = 10.526% per annum.

But the options don't include 10.5%. So perhaps it's not simple interest. Maybe it's add-on interest, where the interest is calculated on the initial principal and added to the principal, making the total amount due 380 + (380 * rate) = 420, so 420 = 380 (1 + rate). So rate = (420/380) -1 = 0.10526 or 10.526% per annum. But again, the options don't have this.

Hmm, maybe the APR is higher because the payments are made monthly, so the effective interest rate is higher. Let's think about that.

The effective APR can be calculated using the formula:

APR = (2 * n * I) / (P * (n +1))

Where:
n = number of payments =12
I = total interest =40
P= principal=380

So APR = (2 *12 *40) / (380 *13) → (960)/(4940) ≈ 0.1943 or 19.43%.

Wait, that's approximately 19.4%, which matches option J:19.4%. But let me double-check the formula.

Wait, the formula I used is for the APR when payments are made every period. Alternatively, the formula is:

APR = (Total Interest * 2 * number of periods) / (Principal * (number of periods +1))

So plugging in:

APR = (40 * 2 *12) / (380 *13) = (960) / (4940) ≈ 0.1943 → 19.43%.

So that's about 19.4%, which is option J.
