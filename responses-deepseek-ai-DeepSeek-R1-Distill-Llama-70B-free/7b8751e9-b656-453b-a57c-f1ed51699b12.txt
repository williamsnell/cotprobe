Okay, so I've got this question here about finding out how much I need to deposit annually at a 6% interest rate over ten years to end up with $300,000. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my finance formulas, but I'll try to think this through.

Alright, I remember that when dealing with future values of regular payments, it's related to something called an annuity. Specifically, an ordinary annuity where payments are made at the end of each period. The formula for the future value of an ordinary annuity, I think, is FV = PMT × [(1 + r)^n - 1]/r. Let me make sure I got that right. FV is the future value, PMT is the annual payment, r is the interest rate per period, and n is the number of periods.

So in this case, the FV we want is $300,000. The rate is 6%, which is 0.06 as a decimal. The number of years is 10, so n would be 10. I need to find PMT.

Plugging the numbers into the formula: 300,000 = PMT × [(1 + 0.06)^10 - 1]/0.06.

Wait, let me calculate the denominator part first. (1.06)^10. I think 1.06 to the power of 10 is approximately 1.7908. Let me double-check that. Let me compute it step by step. 

1.06^1 = 1.06
1.06^2 = 1.1236
1.06^3 ≈ 1.1910
1.06^4 ≈ 1.2625
1.06^5 ≈ 1.3382
1.06^6 ≈ 1.4185
1.06^7 ≈ 1.5036
1.06^8 ≈ 1.5937
1.06^9 ≈ 1.6890
1.06^10 ≈ 1.7908. Yeah, that’s right.

So, (1.7908 - 1) is 0.7908. Then, divide that by 0.06. 0.7908 / 0.06 = let's see, 0.06 times 13 is 0.78, so 0.7908/0.06 is about 13.168. So the denominator part is approximately 13.168.

So now, the equation is 300,000 = PMT × 13.168. To find PMT, I divide both sides by 13.168. 

So PMT = 300,000 / 13.168. Let me compute that. 300,000 divided by 13.168. Hmm. Let me do this division step by step. 

13.168 goes into 300,000 how many times? Let me approximate. 13 times 22,000 is 286,000 (since 13*22=286). So 13.168 * 22,760 would be close. Let me calculate 13.168 * 22,760.

Wait, 22,760 * 13,168. Wait, maybe I should do this differently. Alternatively, 300,000 /13.168 ≈ 22,761. Because 13.168 × 22,761 equals approximately 300,000. Let me check: 13.168 × 20,000 is 263,360. Then, 13.168 ×2,761 is about 36,340 (since 13.168 *2,000=26,336 and 13.168 *700=9,217.6, so 26,336+9,217.6=35,553.6. Then 13.168*61=804. So 35,553.6 + 804 = 36,357.6). So 263,360 +36,357.6=299,717.6. That's very close to 300,000. So PMT is approximately $22,761.

Looking at the options, option A is $22,761. So the answer should be A.

Wait, but let me think again. Did I mix up the formula? Let me make sure I used the correct one. Oh wait, another thought: The formula I used is for ordinary annuity (payments at end of period). But in some cases, people use the present value or other formulas. Wait, no, the question is about future value, so yes, the formula I used applies.

Alternatively, maybe I should check using another approach. The present value of an annuity formula is different, but here it's about future value, so I think I'm correct.

So yes, the correct answer is A: $22,761.

To determine the annual deposit required to yield $300,000 at 6% interest over ten years, we use the future value of an ordinary annuity formula:

\[
FV = PMT \times \frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r}
\]

Where:
- \( FV = 300,000 \) (desired future value),
- \( r = 0.06 \) (annual interest rate),
- \( n = 10 \) (number of years),
- \( PMT \) is the annual payment to be calculated.

First, calculate \( (1 + 0.06)^{10} \), which equals approximately \( 1.7908 \). Then, subtract 1 to get \( 0.7908 \), and divide by \( 0.06 \), resulting in \( 13.168 \). This represents the factor by which the annual payment grows over ten years.

Next, solve for \( PMT \):

\[
PMT = \frac{300,000}{13.168} \approx 22,761
\]

Thus, the annual deposit required is approximately $22,761, which corresponds to option A.
