Okay, so I've got this car rental problem to solve. Let me read through it carefully to make sure I understand everything. The question is asking about the cost of renting a compact car for 2 days and 4 hours, and driving 364 miles. There's a rate schedule provided, so I need to parse that correctly.

First, I'll look at the schedule. It's divided into sections: Local and One-Way Car Rate per Day, Rate per Week, and Rate for Extra Hours. The compact car's details are under each of these categories.

So the compact car has a daily rate of $12.00 per day. Wait, but what about the extra hours? The problem mentions 2 days and 4 hours. I think I need to calculate the cost for the time first, then the mileage.

The minimum charge is the 24-hour rate, which I think means that even if you rent for less than a day, you get charged for a full day. But in this case, the rental is 2 days and 4 hours. Let me think: each day is 24 hours, so 2 days would be 48 hours. Adding 4 more hours makes it 52 hours total.

Wait, or maybe the initial approach is to consider the days and then the extra hours beyond that. So perhaps the first two days are each a full day, and then the extra 4 hours are charged separately.

Looking at the rate for extra hours, it's $2.75 per hour over 24. Wait, no, actually, the way it's written is a bit confusing. Let me recheck: "Rate for Extra Hours: $2.75 per hour over 24". So if you go beyond 24 hours in a day, you get charged extra per hour. Or maybe it's per each extra hour beyond the daily rate.

Wait, perhaps the structure is that each day is up to 24 hours, and any hours beyond that within the same day are charged extra. But in this case, the total rental is 2 days and 4 hours. Wait, that's 52 hours total. Alternatively, perhaps it's 2 full days (48 hours) plus an extra 4 hours beyond that. So for the time, the calculation would be:

Each full day is $12.00. So 2 days would be 2 * $12 = $24. Then, the extra 4 hours would be 4 * $2.75. Let me compute that: 4 * 2.75 is $11. So time cost is $24 + $11 = $35.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused. The way the schedule is written is a bit ambiguous. Let's re-examine the schedule:

The "Rate per Day" is $12.00 per day for compact. Then, "Rate for Extra Hours" is $2.75 per hour over 24. So perhaps each day is 24 hours, and any hours beyond that are extra. So if someone rents for, say, 25 hours, they would be charged for one day plus one extra hour.

But in our case, the total rental period is 2 days and 4 hours. So that's 2 days (48 hours) plus 4 hours, totaling 52 hours. So the initial 48 hours would be 2 days, each at $12, so 2 * 12 = $24. The extra 4 hours beyond the 48 would be charged at $2.75 each, so 4 * 2.75 = $11. So the total time cost is $24 + $11 = $35.

Alternatively, perhaps each day is 24 hours, and any partial day beyond that is charged as extra hours. So for each 24-hour period, you get charged a day rate, and anything beyond that within the same 24-hour period is extra.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the 2 days and 4 hours is 2 full days plus 4 hours, which is 52 hours. So 2 days would be 2 * $12 = $24. The remaining 4 hours are extra, so 4 * $2.75 = $11. So total time cost is $35.

Next, the mileage. The compact car's rate is $0.14 per mile, and gas is included. So for 364 miles, the cost would be 364 * 0.14.

Let me compute that. 364 * 0.14. Let me break it down: 300 * 0.14 = $42, 64 * 0.14 = $8.96. So total is $42 + $8.96 = $50.96.

Wait, wait, 364 * 0.14: 364 * 0.1 is 36.4, 364 * 0.04 is 14.56. So 36.4 +14.56=50.96. Yep, that's correct.

So total mileage cost is $50.96.

Now, adding the time cost and mileage: $35 + $50.96 = $85.96.

Wait, but I think I'm forgetting something. The insurance. Oh right, the insurance is $1.20 per day for collision and $1.20 per day for liability. So per day, that's $2.40. But wait, it's per day or any part thereof. So each day or any part of a day counts as a day for insurance.

But the rental period is 2 days and 4 hours. So that's 2 full days plus 4 hours, which is part of a third day. So insurance would be charged for 3 days. Because any part of a day counts as a full day.

Wait, no. Let me think again. The total duration is 2 days and 4 hours. So the first two days are full days, and the extra 4 hours would be part of a third day. So for insurance, it's charged per day or any part thereof. So each day or part of a day counts as a day.

So for 2 days and 4 hours, that's 2 full days plus 4 hours. So the 4 hours would count as an additional day for insurance. So total of 3 days of insurance.

So insurance cost is 3 days * ($1.20 collision + $1.20 liability) = 3 * $2.40 = $7.20.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me double-check the insurance charges. The problem states: "INSURANCE: (per day or any part thereof): Collision, $1.20; Liability, $1.20". So each day or any part of a day adds both collision and liability. So each day is $2.40.

But the total time is 2 days and 4 hours. The first two days are full days, so that's 2 days. The 4 hours is part of a third day, so that's an additional day. So 3 days in total for insurance. So 3 * $2.40 = $7.20.

So adding that to the previous total of $85.96, the total cost becomes $85.96 + $7.20 = $93.16.

Wait, but let me check the options. The options are A through J, with J being $93.16. So that would be option J.

Wait, but perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the time cost. Let me re-examine that part. The problem says 2 days and 4 hours. So that's 2 days plus 4 hours. Now, the rate per day is $12, but if you go over 24 hours, you get charged extra hours.

Wait, perhaps the way it's structured is that each full day is 24 hours, and any hours beyond a day are extra. So for each 24-hour period, you get the day rate, and beyond that, it's extra.

So 2 days would be 48 hours. The extra 4 hours would be beyond that. So the time cost is 2 * $12 = $24 for the days, plus 4 * $2.75 = $11 for the extra hours. So that part is correct.

So adding everything up: time ($35) + mileage ($50.96) + insurance ($7.20) = $35 + $50.96 = $85.96 + $7.20 = $93.16.

So the answer should be J: $93.16.

To calculate the cost of renting a compact car for 2 days and 4 hours, and driving 364 miles, we need to break down the costs into time, mileage, and insurance.

### Time Cost:
- The rental period is 2 days and 4 hours, which totals 52 hours.
- The first 48 hours (2 days) are charged at the daily rate of $12.00 per day:
  \[
  2 \times 12 = 24 \, \text{dollars}.
  \]
- The remaining 4 hours are charged at the extra hourly rate of $2.75 per hour:
  \[
  4 \times 2.75 = 11 \, \text{dollars}.
  \]
- Total time cost:
  \[
  24 + 11 = 35 \, \text{dollars}.
  \]

### Mileage Cost:
- The car is driven 364 miles, and the mileage rate is $0.14 per mile:
  \[
  364 \times 0.14 = 50.96 \, \text{dollars}.
  \]

### Insurance Cost:
- Insurance is charged at $1.20 per day for collision and $1.20 per day for liability, totaling $2.40 per day.
- The rental period is 2 days and 4 hours. Since any part of a day is considered a full day, the 4 hours count as an additional day. Thus, the total number of days for insurance is 3:
  \[
  3 \times 2.40 = 7.20 \, \text{dollars}.
  \]

### Total Cost:
- Adding up the time, mileage, and insurance costs:
  \[
  35 + 50.96 + 7.20 = 93.16 \, \text{dollars}.
  \]

### Final Answer:
The total cost of renting the compact car is **$93.16**, which corresponds to option **J**.
