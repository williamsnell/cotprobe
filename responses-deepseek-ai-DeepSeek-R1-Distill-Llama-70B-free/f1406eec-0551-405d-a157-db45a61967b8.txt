Okay, so I've got this question about the maximum efficiency of a steam engine. Hmm, I remember that efficiency in engines is related to thermodynamics, probably something to do with the Carnot cycle. Let me think.

The question gives me the input steam temperature and the exhaust temperature. Oh right, the maximum efficiency is the Carnot efficiency, which depends on the temperatures of the hot and cold reservoirs. The formula for that is (1 - T_cold / T_hot), but wait, I think those temperatures need to be in Kelvin, not Celsius.

So the input steam is 175°C. To convert that to Kelvin, I add 273.15. Let me calculate: 175 + 273.15 is 448.15 K. And the exhaust is 75°C, so adding 273.15 gives me 348.15 K.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the Carnot efficiency uses the absolute temperatures. So the formula is (T_hot - T_cold) / T_hot, but wait, no, the correct formula is (1 - (T_cold / T_hot)), right? Because efficiency is 1 minus the ratio of the cold to hot temperatures in Kelvin.

So plugging in the numbers: T_hot is 448.15 K and T_cold is 348.15 K. So T_cold divided by T_hot is 348.15 / 448.15. Let me compute that. Hmm, 348 divided by 448. Let me approximate. Well, 348 is about 0.775 times 448, because 448 times 0.7 is 313.6, and 0.07 times 448 is about 31.36, so 0.77 would be around 344.16. Close to 348, so approximately 0.777 or so.

Wait, let me compute it more accurately. 348.15 / 448.15. Let me see, 448.15 times 0.777 is about 348. So maybe 0.777.

So 1 - 0.777 is 0.223, which is 22.3% efficiency. Looking at the options, option G is 22.3%. So the answer should be G.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me make sure I didn't mess up the temperatures. Oh wait, the hot reservoir is where heat is input, so that's the higher temperature, 175°C, which is 448 K. The cold reservoir is the exhaust at 75°C, which is 348 K. So yes, the setup is correct.

Another way to compute 348.15/448.15. Let me do it step by step. 348.15 divided by 448.15.

Let me compute 348.15 ÷ 448.15:

Well, 448.15 goes into 348.15 how many times? Less than one, obviously. Let me compute 348.15 / 448.15 ≈ 0.777.

So 1 - 0.777 = 0.223, which is 22.3%. So yes, option G is correct.

The maximum efficiency of a steam engine is determined by the Carnot efficiency formula:

\[
\text{Efficiency} = 1 - \frac{T_{\text{cold}}}{T_{\text{hot}}}
\]

where \(T_{\text{hot}}\) and \(T_{\text{cold}}\) are the absolute temperatures of the hot and cold reservoirs in Kelvin. 

1. Convert the given temperatures to Kelvin:
   - Input steam temperature: \(175^\circ \text{C} + 273.15 = 448.15 \, \text{K}\)
   - Exhaust temperature: \(75^\circ \text{C} + 273.15 = 348.15 \, \text{K}\)

2. Apply the Carnot efficiency formula:
   \[
   \text{Efficiency} = 1 - \frac{348.15}{448.15}
   \]

3. Calculate the ratio:
   \[
   \frac{348.15}{448.15} \approx 0.777
   \]

4. Subtract from 1:
   \[
   1 - 0.777 = 0.223 \, \text{or} \, 22.3\%
   \]

Thus, the maximum efficiency of the steam engine is **22.3%**, which corresponds to option **G**.
