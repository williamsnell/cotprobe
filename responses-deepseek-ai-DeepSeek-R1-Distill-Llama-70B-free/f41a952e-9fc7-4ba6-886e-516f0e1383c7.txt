Okay, so I've got this question here about converting temperature ranges from Fahrenheit to Celsius. Hmm, I remember that Fahrenheit and Celsius have different scales, so the size of a degree differs between them. The question says that the temperature extremes in New York over 50 years differ by 116 Fahrenheit degrees, and I need to express this range in Celsius.

Wait, right, when converting a temperature range (like a difference) from Fahrenheit to Celsius, the formula is different from converting a specific temperature. Oh yeah, I think the formula for converting a range is (°C) = (°F - 32) × 5/9, but wait, no, wait. No, that's for a specific temperature. Oh wait, no, no, wait. Oh wait, no, I think for a range, it's just the difference, so the 32 offset doesn't matter because it's a difference. So the conversion factor is 5/9.

Wait, let me think again. When you have a temperature range (like a change or a difference), the formula is: °C difference = (°F difference) × 5/9. Because the 32 degrees offset cancels out. So for example, a change of 1°F is a change of 5/9 °C. So if the range is 116°F, then the Celsius range is 116 multiplied by 5/9.

Wait, let me do the calculation. 116 times 5 is 580, then divided by 9. Let me compute that. 580 divided by 9. Hmm, 9*64 is 576 (since 9*60=540, 9*4=36, 540+36=576). So 580-576 is 4. So 64 and 4/9, which is approximately 64.444... So about 64.4°C.

Now looking at the options: the options are A to J, but I need to see which one is approximately 64.4. Let's look:

Option H is 64.5 C°, which is very close to 64.444. So the correct answer should be H.

Wait, but wait a minute, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check the calculation. 116 * 5 = 580. 580 divided by 9. Let's do that division step by step. 9 × 64 is 576. 580-576 is 4. So 4/9 is about 0.444. So 64.444... So 64.444°C, which would round to 64.4°C. The closest option is H: 64.5°C. Wait, but why? 64.444 is closer to 64.4 than 64.5. So why is option H 64.5? Oh wait, perhaps I should check if I did the calculation correctly.

Wait another thought: 116 × 5 is indeed 580. 580 divided by 9. Let me compute 580 ÷ 9.

9 × 64 = 576 as before. So 580 - 576 = 4. So it's 64 and 4/9, which is 64.444..., so approximately 64.4°C. None of the options have 64.4. So perhaps the options are rounded to one decimal place. Let me check the options again.

Looking back at the options:

A:58.7
B:60.0
C:52.3
D:48.9
E:80.0
F:76.4
G:70.2
H:64.5
I:62.0
J:55.6

So H is 64.5, which is the closest to 64.444. Wait, but maybe I should have kept more decimal places. Let me compute 4/9 exactly. 4 divided by 9 is 0.444444..., so 64.444... So when rounded to one decimal place, it's 64.4. But the option H is 64.5, which is a tenth higher. Hmm, perhaps the calculation is correct but the options have rounded it up.

Wait another approach: perhaps I made a mistake in the formula. Wait, some sources say that when converting a temperature difference from Fahrenheit to Celsius, you use (F2 - F1) × 5/9. So yes, exactly what I did. So 116 × 5/9 is the correct approach.

So 116 × 5 = 580, 580 ÷ 9 ≈ 64.444°C, which would be approximately 64.4°C, but the option is 64.5, which is H.

So the correct answer should be H: 64.5 C°.

To convert the temperature range from Fahrenheit to Celsius, we use the formula for converting a temperature difference: 

\[
\text{°C} = \text{°F} \times \frac{5}{9}
\]

Here, the range in Fahrenheit is 116°F. Applying the formula:

\[
\text{°C} = 116 \times \frac{5}{9}
\]

First, calculate \(116 \times 5 = 580\). Then divide by 9:

\[
\frac{580}{9} \approx 64.444\ldots
\]

This value is approximately \(64.4 \, \text{°C}\) when rounded to one decimal place. However, the closest option provided is \(64.5 \, \text{°C}\), which corresponds to option H.

Thus, the correct answer is:

H: 64.5 C°

H
