Okay, so I have this question about branding strategies, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's see what it says. The question is about a strategy once called a multibrand policy, where each product is branded independently. I need to pick the correct term from the options.

Hmm, I remember that branding strategies can be a bit confusing. There's family branding where all products share the same brand name, like how Heinz has ketchup, beans, etc., all under Heinz. Then there's individual branding, where each product has its own unique brand, right? So if a company has multiple products each with their own brand, that's individual branding.

Wait, the question mentions "multibrand policy," which I think refers to having multiple brands. So in this case, each product is a separate brand. That makes sense because if you have a multibrand approach, you're not using one main brand for everything.

Looking at the options, let's go through them. Option A is multi-product branding. I'm not too sure about that term. It might refer to having multiple products, but I don't think that's the same as each having their own brand.

Option B is sub-branding. Sub-branding is when you have a main brand and then sub-brands under it, like Toyota has Lexus as a sub-brand. So that's not each product being independent.

Option C is mixed branding. I think that's when a company uses a mix of family branding and individual branding. Maybe some products share the main brand, others don't.

Option D is family branding, which is the opposite of what the question is asking. Family branding uses one brand for all products.

Option E is corporate brands, which refers to the company's overall brand identity, not necessarily each product.

Option F is individual branding. That sounds exactly like what the question describes. Each product has its own brand, independent of others.

Option G is co-branding, which is when two brands collaborate on a product, like a partnership.

Option H is private labels, which are store brands or generic brands, not related to each product having its own brand.

Option I is masterbrand, which I think is another term for the main brand that everything falls under, similar to family branding.

Option J is brand extension, which is when a brand creates a new product under the same name, like adding a new flavor to an existing product line.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be F: Individual branding. Because each product is branded separately, which fits the multibrand policy description.

The correct answer is F: Individual branding. This strategy involves each product being branded independently, fitting the description of a multibrand policy where each product has its own unique brand identity.
