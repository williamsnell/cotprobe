Okay, so I've got this equation here: x^4 + 2x^3 + x = 10. Hmm, I remember that when dealing with polynomial equations, there are some properties related to the roots, like Vieta's formulas. Oh right, Vieta's formulas relate the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots.

Wait, the equation given isn't in standard form. The standard form for a polynomial is when all terms are on one side and it's set equal to zero. So I need to rearrange this equation. Let me subtract 10 from both sides to get it into the correct form.

So, x^4 + 2x^3 + x - 10 = 0. Yeah, that looks right. Now, this is a fourth-degree polynomial, which means there are four roots, real or complex. The question is about the sum of these roots.

I remember that for a general polynomial equation of the form a_n x^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_0 = 0, the sum of the roots is -a_{n-1}/a_n. Oh wait, right! So in this case, the leading coefficient a_4 is 1 (since the x^4 term is just 1x^4), and the coefficient of x^3 is 2.

So applying Vieta's formula, the sum of the roots should be -2/1, which is -2.0. Wait, but the question is about using the Newton-Raphson method. Hmm. Wait, Newton-Raphson is a method for finding roots, not directly for summing them. So why is the question asking about the sum using Newton-Raphson?

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh, perhaps the question is a bit tricky. It says, "using Newton-Raphson method," but I think that might be a red herring. Because Newton-Raphson is used to find individual roots, but the sum of all roots can be found via Vieta's formula without needing to compute each root.

So maybe the mention of Newton-Raphson is just extra information, and the correct approach is to use Vieta's formula. So the sum is -2.0, right? Let me check the options.

Looking at the options, option E is -2.0. So the answer should be E.

I think that's it. Sometimes questions try to throw you off with extra details, but knowing the theory helps.

The given equation is \( x^4 + 2x^3 + x = 10 \). To analyze the sum of its roots, it is first rewritten in standard polynomial form as \( x^4 + 2x^3 + x - 10 = 0 \). This is a fourth-degree polynomial, meaning it has four roots (real or complex).

Using Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of a polynomial \( a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \dots + a_0 = 0 \) is given by \( -\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n} \). Here, the leading coefficient \( a_4 = 1 \) and the coefficient of \( x^3 \) is \( a_3 = 2 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots is:

\[
-\frac{a_3}{a_4} = -\frac{2}{1} = -2.0
\]

The mention of the Newton-Raphson method in the question is unnecessary for determining the sum of the roots, as Vieta's formula provides the result directly. Among the given options, the correct answer is:

E: -2.0
