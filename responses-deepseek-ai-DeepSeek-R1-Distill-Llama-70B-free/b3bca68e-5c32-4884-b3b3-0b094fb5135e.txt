Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about when police can make arrests without a warrant. I'm a bit rusty on my criminal procedure, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking which option is not a circumstance where an arrest can be made without a warrant. Let me remember the rules about warrantless arrests.

From what I recall, generally, a warrant is required for arrests, but there are exceptions. The main exceptions are:

1. If a felony is committed in the officer's presence.
2. If a misdemeanor is committed in the officer's presence, especially if it's a breach of the peace.
3. If the officer has probable cause to believe a felony has been committed and that the person did it, even if the felony wasn't in their presence.
4. Exigent circumstances, like hot pursuit, but that's more about entering a home without a warrant.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Officer arrests for a misdemeanor not breaching the peace and not in their presence. Wait, I think misdemeanors require the offense to be committed in the officer's presence. So if it's not in their presence, they can't arrest without a warrant. Unless it's a breach of peace. So this might be incorrect.

Option B: Officer must have probable cause for a felony and that the person did it. That sounds right. I think that's one of the exceptions. So B is a valid circumstance, meaning it's not the answer.

Option C: Arrest for a misdemeanor in their presence without evidence. Wait, but if it's in their presence, maybe they don't need evidence beyond their own observation. So this might be allowed. But I'm a bit confused here. Maybe they can arrest based on what they see, even without other evidence. So C could be a valid situation, meaning it's not the answer.

Option D: Arrest for a misdemeanor that hasn't occurred yet. That sounds like it's about preventing future crimes. I don't think police can arrest someone for something that hasn't happened. They might be able to detain briefly, but not arrest without a warrant. So D might be the incorrect circumstance, making it the answer.

Option E: Arrest for a felony regardless of presence. Wait, no. For felonies, if not in presence, they need probable cause. So if the felony wasn't in their presence, they can still arrest if they have probable cause. So E is a valid circumstance, so not the answer.

Option F: Arrest if suspected to commit a felony in the future. That sounds like pre-crime, which isn't allowed. Police can't arrest someone just because they think they might commit a crime. They need probable cause that a crime has been committed. So F is not a valid circumstance, so it's a possible answer.

Option G: Misdemeanor occurred, officer believes the person did it. So if the misdemeanor happened (maybe not in their presence?), can they arrest without a warrant? I thought misdemeanors require the officer to have witnessed it, unless it's a breach of peace. So if it's not in their presence, maybe they can't arrest without a warrant. So G would be an invalid circumstance, making it the answer.

Option H: Misdemeanor breach of peace in presence. That's definitely allowed. So H is valid, not the answer.

Option I: Arrest based on an unverified tip. I think an unverified tip might not be enough for probable cause. So without a warrant, that might not be allowed. So I could be a possible answer.

Option J: Felony in presence. Yes, that's definitely allowed. So J is valid, not the answer.

Wait, the question is which is NOT a valid circumstance. So I need to find the option that's invalid.

Looking back:

Option A: Misdemeanor not breach of peace, not in presence. I think this is invalid because without a warrant, you can't arrest for a misdemeanor unless it's in your presence. So A is not a valid circumstance.

Option D: Arrest for future misdemeanor. That's not allowed. Arrests are for crimes already committed. So D is invalid.

Option F: Future felony. Not allowed. So F is invalid.

Option G: Misdemeanor occurred, but not in presence. So without a warrant, can't arrest unless it's a breach of peace. So G is invalid.

Option I: Unverified tip. Probably not enough for probable cause. So I is invalid.

Wait, but the options are about which is NOT a circumstance where an arrest can be made without a warrant. So which of these is not allowed.

I think the key points are:

- Misdemeanors: must be in presence, unless breach of peace.
- Felonies: can be arrested without warrant if probable cause, even if not in presence.
- Future crimes: can't arrest without a warrant.
- Tips: need probable cause, an unverified tip might not be enough.

So looking at each option:

A: Misdemeanor not breach of peace, not in presence. So officer can't arrest without a warrant. So this scenario is NOT allowed, making A the correct answer if the question is which is not allowed.

Wait, the question is which is NOT one of the circumstances where arrest can be made without a warrant. So the incorrect option is the one that's not allowed.

Wait, let me restate the options.

The question is: which is not a circumstance where an arrest may be made without a warrant.

So the correct answer is the option that describes a situation where an arrest cannot be made without a warrant.

Looking again:

Option D: Suspected of committing a misdemeanor that has not yet occurred. So that's a future crime. Police can't arrest someone for a crime that hasn't happened yet. So D is not allowed, making it the correct answer.

Option F: Suspected of committing a future felony. Similarly, this is not allowed. So F is also not allowed.

Wait, but the options could have multiple incorrect ones, but the question is which is not a circumstance. So among the options, which one is not allowed.

Wait, among the options, the question is which is NOT one of the circumstances where arrest without a warrant is allowed. So which option is an invalid situation.

So let's go through each option:

A: Officer may arrest for a misdemeanor that is not a breach of peace and committed out of arresting party's presence. Wait, if it's a misdemeanor not in presence and not breach of peace, can they arrest without a warrant? I think no. They need a warrant unless it's in presence or breach of peace.

So A is not allowed, making it the correct answer.

But wait, another option: D says the misdemeanor hasn't occurred yet. So that's even worse because the crime hasn't happened. So D is definitely not allowed.

So which one is the answer?

The question gives options A through J. The correct answer is the one that is not allowed.

So let's think again.

Arrest without warrant is allowed when:

- Felony, with probable cause, whether in presence or not.

- Misdemeanor, if in presence and breach of peace, or just in presence (depending on state law; some require breach, others don't).

- Exigent circumstances, but that's a separate category.

So, looking at the options:

Option A: Misdemeanor not in presence and not breach. So can't arrest without warrant. So A is not allowed.

Option D: Misdemeanor hasn't occurred at all. So no, can't arrest.

Option F: Future felony. No.

Option I: Unverified tip, maybe no probable cause.

So the question is which is not a circumstance.

Looking back at the options:

The question is which is not one of the allowed circumstances.

So the options that describe not allowed are A, D, F, G, I.

Wait, but I think the correct answer is A, D, F, or I.

Wait, the options:

Option D: Suspected of a misdemeanor that hasn't happened yet. That's not allowed. So D is invalid.

Option F: Suspected future felony. Also invalid.

Option I: Arrest based on unverified tip. If the tip doesn't provide probable cause, then it's invalid. But if the tip is reliable, maybe it's okay. But the option says 'unverified source', so perhaps not enough for probable cause. So I is invalid.

Option A: Misdemeanor not in presence and not breach of peace. So without a warrant, can't arrest. So A is invalid.

So the question is to pick the option that is not allowed.

But looking at the answer options, the correct answer is F, D, A, I.

But wait, the options given:

The question is which is NOT one of the circumstances.

So which option is an invalid arrest without a warrant.

Wait, perhaps the answer is F: An officer may arrest if he suspects a person will commit a felony in the future. That's not allowed because you can't arrest someone for a future crime unless under specific pre-crime statutes, which generally don't exist. So F is not a valid circumstance.

Similarly, D says arrest for a misdemeanor that hasn't occurred yet. That's also not allowed.

So in the options, both D and F are not allowed. But I have to choose from the given options.

Wait, looking back at the possible options, the correct answer would be either D or F, but perhaps the answer is F.

Wait, the question asks which is NOT one of the circumstances where an arrest may be made without a warrant.

So the correct answer is the option that is not a valid exception.

So which option is not a valid exception.

Looking at the options again:

Option F: Suspected future felony. Not allowed.

Option D: Suspected future misdemeanor. Not allowed.

Option A: Misdemeanor not in presence and not breach of peace. So without a warrant, can the officer make the arrest? I think no, because for misdemeanors, the arrest without a warrant generally requires the offense to be committed in the officer's presence, unless it's a breach of peace. So A is not allowed.

So the options A, D, F, and I are not allowed.

But the question is, which of the options is not a circumstance. So only one of the options is correct.

Wait, I think I'm getting confused. Let me try to find the correct answer.

Looking up the rules for warrantless arrests:

1. For felonies, an officer can arrest without a warrant if they have probable cause to believe a felony has been committed and the person did it, regardless of whether the felony was in their presence.

2. For misdemeanors, the officer must have probable cause and the misdemeanor must be committed in their presence (or, in some jurisdictions, if it's a breach of the peace even if not in presence).

3. Exigent circumstances (like hot pursuit) allow warrantless arrests.

4. Preventive arrest for future crimes isn't allowed without a warrant, unless under specific statutes which are rare.

So, looking at the options:

Option A: Misdemeanor not in presence and not breach. So not allowed. So A is not a valid circumstance.

Option D: Future misdemeanor. Not allowed.

Option F: Future felony. Not allowed.

Option I: Unverified tip. If it's an unverified source, the officer might not have probable cause. So without probable cause, arrest isn't allowed. So I is invalid.

So the question is which is not a valid circumstance. So the correct answer would be either A, D, F, or I.

Wait, the question is which is NOT a circumstance. So which one is not allowed.

The options that are allowed are:

B: Must have probable cause for a felony. Yes, allowed.

C: Misdemeanor in presence without evidence. Wait, if the officer sees it, that's evidence. So C is allowed.

H: Misdemeanor breach of peace in presence. Allowed.

J: Felony in presence. Allowed.

So among the options, the invalid ones are A, D, F, I.

But the question is which is not a circumstance, so the answer must be one of them.

Looking back at the options, the options are:

A: Can't arrest without warrant because misdemeanor not in presence and not breach.

B: Valid.

C: Valid, because in presence.

D: Invalid because future crime.

E: Valid because felony and probable cause.

F: Invalid because future felony.

G: Misdemeanor occurred, officer believes person did it. But if it's not in presence, and not breach, then can't arrest without warrant. So G is invalid.

H: Valid.

I: Invalid because unverified tip may not establish probable cause.

J: Valid.

So the possible answers are A, D, F, G, I.

But the question asks which is NOT a circumstance, so the correct answer is one of them.

Looking at the options provided, I think the correct answer is either F or D.

Wait, the question is which is not one of the circumstances where an arrest without a warrant is allowed.

So the correct answer must be the option that describes a situation where an arrest without a warrant is not permitted.

In the options:

Option F says an officer may arrest if he suspects a person will commit a felony in the future. That's not allowed because you can't arrest someone for a future crime without a warrant (and usually, even with a warrant, it's not allowed unless specific circumstances).

Similarly, Option D is about a future misdemeanor, which is also not allowed.

But looking at the answer choices, each option is a statement that may or may not be correct.

Wait, I think the answer is F. Because arrest based on future conduct isn't allowed without a warrant.

But I'm a bit torn between F and D.

Wait, but in the options, the answer is F because F is about a future felony, which is not allowed. Similarly, D is about a future misdemeanor, which is also not allowed.

But let me think about the answer options again. The question is which is NOT a circumstance where an arrest may be made without a warrant.

So for example, if an officer arrests someone for a future crime, that's not allowed. So both D and F are not allowed.

But the options only give one correct answer. So perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, looking back at the options:

Option I: An officer may arrest a person based on a tip from an unverified source.

That would depend on whether the tip provides probable cause. If it's an unverified source, maybe it doesn't. So I is not a valid circumstance because without probable cause, the arrest is invalid.

So perhaps I is the answer.

Wait, but the other options:

Option F: Suspecting someone will commit a felony in the future. That's not probable cause that a crime has been committed, but rather anticipation of a future crime. So F is not allowed.

Option D: Suspecting a misdemeanor hasn't occurred yet. So that's also not allowed.

But I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should think about what each option says.

Wait, the question is which is NOT a circumstance where an arrest can be made without a warrant.

So, for example, if the officer can't make an arrest in that situation without a warrant, then it's the correct answer.

Option F: Arresting someone because you think they'll commit a felony. That's not allowed without a warrant because it's a future crime.

Option I: Arresting based on an unverified tip. If the tip doesn't provide probable cause, then it's not allowed. But if the tip is from a reliable source, maybe it's okay. The option says 'unverified', so perhaps not enough.

But in any case, which of these is the correct answer.

I think the intended answer is F, as arresting for a future crime is not allowed. But I'm not entirely certain.

Wait, another approach: looking for the most clearly incorrect option.

Option D: Suspected of committing a misdemeanor that hasn't occurred yet. That's impossible because the crime hasn't happened. So the officer can't have probable cause because there's no crime. So D is not a valid circumstance.

Similarly, Option F: Suspected of future felony. Also not allowed.

But perhaps the answer is D.

Wait, but the question is asking which is not a circumstance. So the correct answer is the one that's not allowed.

I think the answer is F, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, D.

Wait, perhaps I should look for which option is not a recognized exception.

The recognized exceptions are:

1. Felony with probable cause.

2. Misdemeanor in presence.

3. Breach of peace misdemeanor.

4. Exigent circumstances.

Options not covered are future crimes and unverified tips.

So the answer is either F or D.

Wait, but some sources say that a warrantless arrest is allowed for a felony if the officer has probable cause, regardless of presence. But for misdemeanors, it's presence or breach of peace.

So going back to the options:

The question is which is not a circumstance.

So, among the options, option F is about future crimes, which is not allowed. So F is the correct answer.

Wait, but in the initial problem, the options are labeled A through J, and the user is to select the correct one.

So the correct answer is F.
</think>

To determine which option is not a valid circumstance for making an arrest without a warrant, we analyze each option based on the legal exceptions to the warrant requirement. Generally, arrests without a warrant are allowed in the following situations:

1. **Felony**: An officer may arrest without a warrant if they have probable cause to believe a felony has been committed and that the person did it, regardless of whether the felony was committed in their presence.
2. **Misdemeanor**: An officer may arrest without a warrant if the misdemeanor is committed in their presence. Some jurisdictions also allow arrest for misdemeanors that constitute a breach of the peace, even if not in the officer's presence.
3. **Exigent Circumstances**: This includes situations like hot pursuit, but this is not relevant to the options provided.

With these principles in mind, we evaluate each option:

- **Option A**: An officer may arrest for a misdemeanor that is not a breach of peace and committed out of the arresting party's presence.  
  - **Analysis**: This is not allowed because misdemeanors not committed in the officer's presence and not involving a breach of peace require a warrant.  
  - **Conclusion**: Invalid circumstance.

- **Option B**: An officer must have probable cause that a felony has occurred and that the arrested person committed it.  
  - **Analysis**: This is a valid circumstance for a warrantless arrest.  
  - **Conclusion**: Valid circumstance.

- **Option C**: An officer may arrest for a misdemeanor committed in their presence without any evidence.  
  - **Analysis**: This is allowed because the officer's observation of the misdemeanor in progress constitutes sufficient basis for arrest.  
  - **Conclusion**: Valid circumstance.

- **Option D**: An officer may arrest a person if they are suspected of committing a misdemeanor that has not yet occurred.  
  - **Analysis**: This is not allowed because arrests cannot be made for future crimes.  
  - **Conclusion**: Invalid circumstance.

- **Option E**: An officer may arrest a person if they have committed a felony, regardless of the officer's presence during the crime.  
  - **Analysis**: This is allowed if the officer has probable cause.  
  - **Conclusion**: Valid circumstance.

- **Option F**: An officer
