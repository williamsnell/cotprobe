Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about heritability in fruit flies. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's think it through.

The question says that the mean number of abdominal bristles in a population is 38. Then, they selected flies that had an average of 42.8 bristles to breed the next generation. The F1 generation ended up with a mean of 40.6 bristles. We need to find the heritability of this trait.

Wait, what's heritability again? Oh right, heritability estimates the degree to which variation in a trait is due to genetic factors. It's usually calculated as the ratio of the variance of the trait due to genetics over the total variance.

But wait, there's also something about selective breeding and the response to selection. Oh yeah, I remember the breeder's equation. It says that the response to selection (R) is equal to the heritability (h²) multiplied by the selection differential (S). So R = h² * S.

So, the selection differential S is the difference between the mean of the selected parents and the mean of the original population. Let me calculate that. The original mean is 38, selected parents are 42.8. So S = 42.8 - 38 = 4.8.

The response R is the difference between the F1 generation mean and the original population mean. F1 is 40.6, original is 38. So R = 40.6 - 38 = 2.6.

Now, using R = h² * S. We can rearrange that to h² = R / S. Plugging the numbers in: h² = 2.6 / 4.8.

Let me compute that. 2.6 divided by 4.8. Hmm, 4.8 goes into 2.6 how many times? Let me see, 4.8 * 0.5 is 2.4. So 0.5 is 2.4, and we have 0.2 left (2.6-2.4=0.2). 0.2 is 4.8 * 0.041666... So total is approx 0.541666. So about 0.54.

Looking at the options, option G is 0.54. So that should be the answer.

Wait, but wait a second. Heritability is the proportion of the variation due to genetics. But in the breeder's equation, the response is due to the additive genetic variance. So if the heritability is 0.54, that means 54% of the variation is genetic.

Alternatively, did I get R right? The F1 mean is 40.6, which is higher than the original 38. So yes, R is 2.6. And S is 4.8. So yes, 2.6/4.8 is 0.54. So the answer should be G.

To calculate the heritability of the trait, we use the breeder's equation:  

\[
R = h^2 \cdot S
\]

Where:  
- \( R \) is the response to selection, calculated as the difference between the mean of the \( F_1 \) generation and the original population.  
- \( S \) is the selection differential, calculated as the difference between the mean of the selected parents and the original population.  
- \( h^2 \) is the heritability.  

### Step 1: Calculate \( S \) (Selection Differential)  
\[
S = \text{Mean of selected parents} - \text{Original population mean} = 42.8 - 38 = 4.8
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( R \) (Response to Selection)  
\[
R = \text{Mean of } F_1 \text{ generation} - \text{Original population mean} = 40.6 - 38 = 2.6
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( h^2 \) (Heritability)  
Rearranging the breeder's equation:  
\[
h^2 = \frac{R}{S}
\]

Substitute the values:  
\[
h^2 = \frac{2.6}{4.8} \approx 0.54
\]

### Final Answer  
The heritability of the trait is approximately **0.54**, which corresponds to option **G**.
