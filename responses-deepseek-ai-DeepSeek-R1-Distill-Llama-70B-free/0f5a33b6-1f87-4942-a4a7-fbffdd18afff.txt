Okay, so I've got this question about the prevailing notions before Lyell and Darwin. Hmm, I remember that Lyell was a geologist and Darwin was a biologist, right? They both contributed a lot to the fields of evolution and the age of the Earth.

Wait, the question is asking about what people believed before their time. So I think before Lyell, most people thought the Earth was pretty young, maybe a few thousand years old. I remember something about Ussher calculating the Earth's age based on the Bible, getting around 4004 BC or something like that. So that's a few thousand years, not millions or billions.

And about populations—like species and such. Before Darwin, the common belief was probably that species don't change. Like, they're fixed, created as they are. So the idea of evolution, where species change over time, wasn't widely accepted. So populations are unchanging.

Putting that together, the Earth was seen as young (a few thousand years) and species were static, not evolving. So looking at the options:

Option D says Earth is a few thousand years old and populations are unchanging. That fits.

Wait, but let me double-check. Lyell's work was about uniformitarianism, which suggested the Earth was much older, shaped by gradual processes. So before Lyell, the Earth was thought to be younger. And before Darwin, the fixity of species was the norm—so no gradual changes. So yes, D makes sense.

The prevailing notion before the time of Lyell and Darwin was that the Earth was relatively young, typically believed to be a few thousand years old, based on interpretations like those of Archbishop Ussher. Additionally, it was widely accepted that species were fixed and unchanging, with no concept of gradual evolution. This aligns with Option D.

Answer: D
