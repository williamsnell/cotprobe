Okay, so I've got this question about the vibrational partition function of Br2. The vibrational wavenumber is given as 323.2 cm^-1. I need to find out at what temperature the explicit value of the partition function is within 5% of the approximate formula's value.

Hmm, I remember that the vibrational partition function (q_vib) can be calculated using the formula for a quantum harmonic oscillator. The exact formula is q = 1/(1 - e^(-βhcν)), where β is 1/(kT), h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and ν is the wavenumber. But wait, there's also an approximate formula, right? Oh yeah, when the thermal energy (kT) is much larger than the energy spacing (hcν), the vibrational modes can be treated classically, so the partition function approximates to kT/(hcν). But that's only valid at high temperatures.

So the problem is comparing the exact value with this approximate value and finding when they're within 5%. I think the plan is to set up the ratio of the exact q to the approximate q and find when that ratio is between 0.95 and 1.05.

Let me write down the exact and approximate formulas.

Exact: q_exact = 1/(1 - e^(-x)), where x = hcν/(kT). Wait, no, because β is 1/(kT), so x would be hcν * β = hcν/(kT). So x = (hcν)/(kT).

Approximate: q_approx = (kT)/(hcν) * (1/(1 - e^(-x))) ). Wait, no. Wait, the high-temperature limit is when x is small. So when x is small, e^(-x) ≈ 1 - x + x²/2 - ... So 1/(1 - e^(-x)) ≈ (1/(x)) (1/(1 - (1 -x + x²/2)) )) → (1/(x))(1/(x - x²/2)) ) ≈ 1/(x) (1 + x/2) when x is small. But that's getting more complicated.

Wait, I think the approximate formula for the vibrational partition function in the high-temperature limit is q_approx = kT/(h c ν). Because when the energy is much less than kT, each vibrational mode contributes a term like kT/(h c ν), right? So when x is small (high T), the exact q is approximately q_approx multiplied by a correction factor. Let me think:

q_exact = 1/(1 - e^(-x)) 

At high T, x is small. So e^(-x) ≈ 1 - x + x²/2. So 1 - e^(-x) ≈ x (1 - x/2). Therefore, q_exact ≈ 1/(x (1 - x/2)) ) = (1/x) (1 + x/2 + (x/2)^2 + ... ) ≈ (1/x)(1 + x/2) using the first two terms.

Wait, but the approximate formula is q_approx = (kT)/(h c ν) = 1/x. So q_exact / q_approx ≈ 1 + x/2. So the ratio is 1 + x/2. So the condition is that (q_exact - q_approx)/q_approx ≤ 5%, which would mean (x/2) ≤ 0.05 → x ≤ 0.1.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. Because the approximate formula is q_approx = 1/x. So the exact q is 1/(1 - e^(-x)) = 1/(e^{-x/2} (e^{x/2} - e^{-x/2})/2 )) ??? No, perhaps expanding differently.

Alternatively, using the expansion for small x:

1/(1 - e^{-x}) ≈ (1/x) * (1 + x/2 + x²/12 + ... )

So q_exact ≈ (1/x)(1 + x/2 + x²/12 )

So when we take the ratio q_exact / q_approx, which is (1 + x/2 + x²/12 ), and set this ratio to be within 5% of 1. So 0.95 ≤ 1/(1 - e^{-x}) / (1/x) ) ≤ 1.05.

Wait, no. Wait, q_approx is 1/x, so the ratio is (1/(1 - e^{-x})) / (1/x) ) = x/(1 - e^{-x}).

Wait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the approach is to compute the exact q and the approximate q, take their ratio, set it to 1.05 and find T.

Alternatively, perhaps I should work with the exact and approximate expressions.

Let me define x = h c ν/(k T). Then, the exact q is 1/(1 - e^{-x} ), and the approximate q is (k T)/(h c ν) ) = 1/x.

So the ratio q_exact / q_approx = (1/(1 - e^{-x})) * x → x / (1 - e^{-x} )

We set this ratio to be 1.05 (since 5% higher than the approximate). So:

x / (1 - e^{-x}) = 1.05

We need to solve for x in this equation.

Let me denote y = x. So equation becomes y/(1 - e^{-y}) = 1.05.

Let me solve for y.

Compute 1 - e^{-y} = y / 1.05.

So e^{-y} = 1 - y/1.05 = (1.05 - y)/1.05.

Take natural logarithm on both sides:

-y = ln( (1.05 - y)/1.05 )

Multiply both sides by -1:

y = - ln( (1.05 - y)/1.05 )

Simplify the argument of ln:

(1.05 - y)/1.05 = 1 - y/1.05.

So:

y = - ln(1 - y/1.05 )

Hmm, this is a transcendental equation. I might need to solve it numerically.

Let me make an initial guess. Let me try y=0.1.

Compute RHS: -ln(1 - 0.1/1.05) = -ln( (1.05 - 0.1)/1.05 ) = -ln(0.95/1.05 ) → Wait, no, 1.05 - y is 1.05 - 0.1 = 0.95. So 0.95 / 1.05 is 0.90476.

So ln(0.90476) is about -0.100. So RHS is 0.100. So y=0.1 gives RHS=0.1; so 0.1=0.1, which seems to fit. Wait, but let me check:

y=0.1:

Left side: y=0.1.

Right side: -ln(1 - 0.1/1.05 ) = -ln(1 - 0.095238 ) ≈ -ln(0.904762) ≈ 0.10017.

So that's approximately 0.10017 ≈ 0.1. So y=0.1 is a solution.

So when x=0.1, the ratio is 1.05. So the condition is met when x=0.1.

So x = (h c ν) / (k T ) = 0.1 → T = (h c ν) / (0.1 k )

Now I need to compute T using the given ν.

ν is 323.2 cm^-1. Let's convert that to m^-1: 323.2 cm^-1 = 3232 m^-1.

But actually, I remember that in spectroscopy, wavenumbers are often in cm^-1, and the product hc is often known in cm·K units with appropriate constants.

Wait, the value of hc in cm·K is approximately 1.4388 cm·K. Because h=6.626e-34 J·s, c=3e8 m/s, k=1.38e-23 J/K.

Wait, let me compute hc in terms of cm·K:

h = 6.62607015e-34 J·s

c = 299792458 m/s = 2.99792458e10 cm/s

k = 1.380649e-23 J/K

So hc = (6.626e-34 J·s) * (2.9979e10 cm/s) )= (6.626e-34)(2.9979e10) = approx 1.986e-23 J·cm.

Then, hc/k = (1.986e-23 J·cm) / (1.380649e-23 J/K) ) ≈ 1.4388 cm·K.

So hc/(k) ≈ 1.4388 cm·K.

So ν is given in cm^-1, so:

x = (hc ν) / (k T) ) = (1.4388 cm·K * ν cm^-1 ) / T ) → (1.4388 * ν ) / T.

Wait, because ν is in cm^-1, so cm·K * cm^-1 = K. So x = (1.4388 * ν ) / T.

So our condition is x = 0.1 → T = (1.4388 * ν ) / x.

ν is 323.2 cm^-1, x=0.1.

So T = (1.4388 * 323.2 ) / 0.1 → compute that.

Compute 1.4388 * 323.2:

1.4388 * 300 = 431.64, 1.4388 * 23.2 ≈ let's compute 1.4388 *20=28.776, 1.4388 *3.2≈4.60 → total about 28.776+4.60=33.376. So total approx 431.64 +33.376=465.016.

So 465.016 divided by 0.1 is 4650.16 K.

Looking at the options, option I is 5000 K, option H is 5500, G is 4000, F is 4500, J is 3000. The closest is 4500 (F) or 5000 (I). Wait, but I got approximately 4650 K, which is between 4500 and 5000.

But perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me compute more accurately.

Compute 1.4388 * 323.2:

323.2 * 1 = 323.2

323.2 * 0.4 = 129.28 → 323.2 +129.28 =452.48

323.2 *0.03 = 9.696 → 452.48 +9.696=462.176

323.2 *0.0088= let's compute 323.2 *0.008=2.5856, 323.2 *0.0008=0.25856 → total 2.5856+0.25856=2.84416. So 462.176 + 2.84416=465.02016.

So 465.02016 / 0.1 = 4650.2016 K.

So approximately 4650 K. Looking back at the options:

The options are: A:7000, B:2500, C:3500, D:6000, E:2000, F:4500, G:4000, H:5500, I:5000, J:3000.

So 4650 is closest to option F (4500) or option I (5000). Wait, 4650 is 150 above 4500, and 350 below 5000. Hmm, but perhaps the exact value is a bit higher.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the initial assumption. Let me double-check.

Wait, the condition is that the exact q is within 5% of the approximate q. That is, |q_exact - q_approx| / q_approx ≤ 0.05.

Wait, but earlier I set q_exact / q_approx = 1.05, which would correspond to q_exact being 5% higher than q_approx. So that's one scenario. Alternatively, it could also be 5% lower, but I think in this case, for x < something, the q_exact is higher than q_approx, because when x approaches 0, q_exact approaches q_approx from above.

Wait, when x is very small, q_exact is 1/(1 - e^{-x}) ≈ 1/(x (1 - x/2)) ) ≈ (1/x)(1 + x/2). So q_exact is about (1/x) (1 + x/2), which is q_approx (1/x) multiplied by (1 + x/2). So q_exact is higher than q_approx by a factor of (1 + x/2), which for small x, is about 5% when x is about 0.1. So when x=0.1, the ratio is 1.05.

Therefore, the temperature T at which x=0.1 is the point where the exact q is 5% higher than the approximate. So solving for T gives us around 4650 K.

Looking at the options, 4500 K is option F, 5000 is I. So 4650 is closer to 4500 (only 150 off) than 5000 (350 off). But maybe in the actual calculation, the exact T is just over 4500, so perhaps the intended answer is F:4500 K.

Wait, but another thing: perhaps I should have considered the relative error. Wait, when x is 0.1, the ratio is 1.05, which is 5% higher. So the question is, when the value is within 5% of the approximate value. So the exact q can be either 5% higher or 5% lower than the approximate. So perhaps the lower end would correspond to x being higher than 0.1, but that's when the ratio is less than 1.

Wait, let me think again. The approximate q is 1/x. The exact q is 1/(1 - e^{-x} ), which is always greater than 1/x for x>0 because e^{-x} is positive, so denominator is less than x, making the overall fraction larger.

So q_exact is always larger than q_approx. So the ratio q_exact/q_approx is always greater than 1. So when the problem says the value is within 5% of the approximate, it must be that q_exact ≤ 1.05 q_approx. Because q_exact can't be lower than q_approx.

So the condition is q_exact ≤ 1.05 q_approx. So when the ratio is 1.05, that's the point where it's exactly 5% higher. So for lower x (higher T), the ratio approaches 1. So the temperature we found (4650 K) is when the exact q is 5% higher than the approximate. At higher temperatures, the exact q approaches the approximate value from above.

So the temperature where q_exact is within 5% of q_approx would be when x ≤ 0.1, which corresponds to T ≥ 4650 K. So the question is, at what temperature is the value within 5% of the approximate value. So the point where the two are within 5% is when T is above 4650 K.

Looking at the options, the closest higher temperature is 5000 K (option I). Wait, but 4650 is below 5000, so perhaps the intended answer is 5000 K. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects selecting the temperature where it's 5% below, but that's not possible because q_exact is always higher.

Wait, perhaps I should check for the case when the exact q is 5% less than the approximate. But that's impossible because q_exact is always larger than q_approx for x>0.

So the only condition is when q_exact ≤ 1.05 q_approx.

So the temperature where x=0.1 is about 4650 K. So the options don't have this exact value, but the next higher option is 5000 K (option I). Alternatively, the closest option is 4500 K (option F), but 4500 is lower than 4650, so at 4500 K, x would be higher than 0.1, making the ratio higher than 1.05, which is beyond the 5% limit.

Wait, let me compute T for x=0.1 accurately.

Wait, the calculation was T = (1.4388 cm·K * 323.2 cm^-1) / x.

So 1.4388 * 323.2 = let me compute precisely.

1.4388 * 300 = 431.64

1.4388 * 23.2 = let's compute 1.4388 *20=28.776, 1.4388 *3.2=4.60416. So 28.776 +4.60416=33.38016.

So total is 431.64 +33.38016=465.02016.

So 465.02016 / 0.1 = 4650.2016 K.

So the temperature is approximately 4650 K. The options don't have this, so the closest higher option is 5000 K (option I) and the closest lower is 4500 K (option F). But which one is within 5%?

Wait, the question is, at what temperature is the value within 5% of the approximate. So when T equals 4650 K, the exact is 5% higher. So at higher temperatures, the exact value approaches the approximate value, so the difference becomes less than 5%. Therefore, any T higher than 4650 K would make the exact q within 5% of the approximate.

Looking at the options, the next higher T is 5000 K. So at 5000 K, the exact q is within 5% of the approximate.

Wait, but the options don't have 4650, so perhaps the intended answer is 5000 K, option I.

Wait, but let me check the alternative approach. Maybe the question is referring to when the exact q is within 5% of the approximate, which can be either higher or lower. But since exact is always higher, it's only the upper limit that matters.

Alternatively, perhaps I got the condition reversed. Wait, the approximate formula is for high temperatures, so as T increases, the approximation becomes better. So the temperature where the exact and approximate are within 5% is when T is high enough, which would be around 4650 K. So the options
