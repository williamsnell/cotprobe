Question:

Discuss cognitive development during adolescence as describedby Piaget.

Options:

A: The stage of formal operations begins at about the age of 11 when the child begins to think abstractly, hypothetically, and idealistically.
B: Cognitive development peaks in early adolescence and declines thereafter.
C: Cognitive development during adolescence is marked by a return to sensory-motor thinking.
D: Cognitive development begins in adolescence.
E: Cognitive development ends with the stage of formal operations.
F: Adolescents revert to egocentric thinking patterns that are typical of early childhood.
G: The stage of formal operations is only reached by a minority of individuals, with most never advancing beyond concrete operations.
H: The stage of formal operations is achieved by all individuals by the age of 8.
I: Cognitive development is characterized by the ability to deal with concrete situations.
J: Adolescents primarily focus on developing practical skills rather than abstract thinking.

Okay, I need to answer this multiple-choice question about Piaget's theory of cognitive development during adolescence. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that Jean Piaget proposed a theory of cognitive development that includes four stages. The stages are: sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational. Each stage builds on the previous one and occurs at a specific age range.

The question is specifically about adolescence. From what I recall, Piaget's formal operational stage is the last stage and typically begins around adolescence. So that would be around age 11 or 12. During this stage, adolescents develop the ability to think abstractly, reason logically, and consider hypothetical situations. They can also think about abstract concepts and develop theories.

Looking at the options now:

Option A says the stage of formal operations begins around 11 and involves abstract, hypothetical, and idealistic thinking. That matches what I remember. So A seems correct.

Option B claims cognitive development peaks in early adolescence and declines. I don't think that's right. Piaget's stages are about progression, not decline. So B is incorrect.

Option C suggests a return to sensory-motor thinking. No, that's the first stage in infancy. Adolescents are in the formal operational stage, so C is wrong.

Option D states cognitive development begins in adolescence. No, development starts much earlier, with the first stage in infancy. So D is incorrect.

Option E says cognitive development ends with formal operations. Yes, that's the last stage according to Piaget, so E is correct in that sense, but the question is about what describes development during adolescence, which is the beginning of formal operations, not the end. But wait, the option says "ends with", which is accurate but doesn't directly answer the question. Hmm, the question is about what happens during adolescence. So perhaps E is not the best answer.

Option F talks about reverting to egocentric thinking. Egocentrism is a part of the preoperational stage, not adolescence. So F is incorrect.

Option G claims only a minority reach formal operations. I think Piaget believed that not everyone reaches this stage, but the question is about when it begins. So G might be a possible correct point, but the question is about the description during adolescence, not about how many reach it.

Option H says formal operations are achieved by all by age 8. No, age 8 is when concrete operations typically start. Formal operations begin later, around 11-12. So H is wrong.

Option I says it's about concrete situations. That's the concrete operational stage, which is before adolescence. So I is incorrect.

Option J says adolescents focus on practical skills. No, during formal operations, they develop abstract thinking, not just practical skills. So J is wrong.

So the correct answer should be A. It accurately describes the onset of the formal operations stage in adolescence, characterized by abstract, hypothetical, and idealistic thinking.

The correct answer is **A**. According to Piaget, the stage of formal operations begins in adolescence, around age 11, and is marked by the ability to think abstractly, hypothetically, and idealistically.

Answer: A
