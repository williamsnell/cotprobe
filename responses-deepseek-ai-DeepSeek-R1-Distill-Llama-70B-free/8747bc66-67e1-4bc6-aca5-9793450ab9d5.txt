Okay, so I've got this problem here about Armco Truck Rental Co. and Mr. Williams renting a truck. I need to figure out the total cost he paid. Let me read through the question again to make sure I get all the details right.

Alright, Armco charges $32 per day, $0.22 per mile, and $0.55 per gallon of gasoline. Oh, and there's an additional charge for hours beyond a day, which is $2.75 per hour. Mr. Williams rented the truck for 2 days and 3 hours. He drove 320 miles and used 30 gallons of gas. I need to calculate the total cost.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, I'll tackle each component separately and then add them all up at the end.

Starting with the daily rental charge. The company charges $32 per day. Mr. Williams rented it for 2 days. So that would be 2 * $32. Let me calculate that. 2 * 32 is 64. So that's $64 so far.

Next, the additional hours. He rented for 2 days and 3 hours. Wait, the 2 days are the full days, and the 3 hours are extra. So the daily rate is probably for 24 hours? I think that's a standard assumption unless stated otherwise. So each day is 24 hours, so 2 days would be 48 hours. He used 2 days and 3 hours, which is 51 hours total. But maybe the additional hours are charged beyond the daily rate. Wait, the way it's worded, "charges $32 per day, additional hours a day are charged at $2.75 per hour." Hmm, perhaps each day is a certain number of hours, and anything beyond that is extra. Wait, perhaps the $32 per day includes a certain number of hours, like 8 hours, and anything beyond that each day is extra. But the question doesn't specify that. Alternatively, maybe it's $32 per each 24 hours, and any hours beyond that are charged as additional. Wait, I think I need to clarify this.

Alternatively, perhaps the $32 per day is a base rate, and any hours beyond a certain number in a day are extra. Let me think. If he rented for 2 days and 3 hours, that would be 2 full days plus 3 hours. So each day's charge is $32, and the 3 extra hours are charged at $2.75 each. So that would be 3 * $2.75. Let me calculate that. 3 times 2.75 is 8.25. So the additional hours cost $8.25.

Wait, but does "additional hours a day" mean per day? Like, if you have more than a certain number of hours in a day, you get charged extra. For example, maybe each day comes with, say, 8 hours, and beyond that, it's extra. But the problem doesn't specify that, so I think my initial approach is correct. He was charged for 2 days at $32 each, which is $64, and 3 additional hours at $2.75 each, which is $8.25, so total for the time is 64 + 8.25 = $72.25.

Wait, but another way: maybe the total time is 2 days and 3 hours, which is 51 hours. If the daily rate is $32 per 24 hours, then for 51 hours, that would be 2 days (48 hours) plus 3 hours. So the 3 hours would be the extra. So yes, that seems to fit. So the time charges are $32*2 = 64, plus 3*2.75 = 8.25, totaling 72.25. That makes sense.

Next, the mileage. He drove 320 miles, and the charge is $0.22 per mile. So 320 * 0.22. Let me compute that. 320 * 0.2 is 64, and 320 * 0.02 is 6.4, so 64 + 6.4 is 70.4. So the mileage cost is $70.40.

Then, the gasoline. He used 30 gallons at $0.55 per gallon. So 30 * 0.55. Let me calculate: 30 * 0.5 is 15, and 30 * 0.05 is 1.5, so 15 + 1.5 = 16.5. So the gasoline cost is $16.50.

Now, adding all these components together: time ($72.25), mileage ($70.40), and gas ($16.50).

Adding them up step by step. 72.25 + 70.40 is 142.65. Then 142.65 +16.50 is 159.15.

Wait, wait, let me check my calculations again. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere. So:

Time: 2 days at $32 = 64. 3 hours at $2.75 each: 3 * 2.75 is 8.25. So total time is 64 + 8.25 = 72.25. That seems correct.

Mileage: 320 * 0.22. Let me compute that again. 320 * 0.2 is 64, 320 * 0.02 is 6.4, sum is 70.4. Correct.

Gas: 30 * 0.55. 30 * 0.5 is 15, 30 * 0.05 is 1.5, sum 16.5. Correct.

Now sum all: 72.25 (time) +70.4 (mileage) = 142.65. Then +16.5 (gas) is 159.15. So total is $159.15.

Looking at the options, option J is $159.15. So the answer should be J.

The total cost for Mr. Williams' truck rental is calculated by breaking down the charges into three components: daily rental, additional hours, mileage, and gasoline.

1. **Daily Rental**:  
   Mr. Williams rented the truck for 2 days at $32 per day.  
   \[
   2 \times 32 = 64 \, \text{dollars}.
   \]

2. **Additional Hours**:  
   He was charged $2.75 per hour for 3 additional hours beyond the 2 days.  
   \[
   3 \times 2.75 = 8.25 \, \text{dollars}.
   \]

3. **Mileage**:  
   The truck was driven 320 miles at $0.22 per mile.  
   \[
   320 \times 0.22 = 70.40 \, \text{dollars}.
   \]

4. **Gasoline**:  
   He used 30 gallons of gasoline at $0.55 per gallon.  
   \[
   30 \times 0.55 = 16.50 \, \text{dollars}.
   \]

Adding all these components together:  
\[
64 + 8.25 + 70.40 + 16.50 = 159.15 \, \text{dollars}.
\]

Thus, the total cost is **$159.15**, which corresponds to option **J**.
