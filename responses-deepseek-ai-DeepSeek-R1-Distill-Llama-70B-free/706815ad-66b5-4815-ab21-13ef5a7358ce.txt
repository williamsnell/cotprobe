Okay, so I've got this problem about calculating the markup percentage for a CB radio. Let me try to work through it step by step. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I think I can figure it out.

Alright, the radio sells for $89.95, and the store pays $65.05 for each. I need to find the percent markup based on the cost and also based on the selling price. Hmm, right, markup can be calculated in two ways: one using the cost as the base and the other using the selling price.

First, I think I should find the difference between the selling price and the cost. The selling price is $89.95, and the cost is $65.05. So subtracting the cost from the selling price: 89.95 - 65.05 = ... let me calculate that. 89.95 minus 65 is 24.95, but since it's 65.05, I subtract 0.05 more, so 24.90. Wait, wait, no, maybe I should do it more carefully.

Let me write it out:
89.95
-65.05
--------
So, 5 from 95 is 0, then 9 from 5? Hmm, maybe borrowing. 9 (after borrowing) becomes 19. 19-5 is 14. Then, 8 becomes 8 after borrowing. 8 -6 is 2. So, 24.90. Yeah, that's correct. So the markup amount is $24.90.

Now, for the markup based on cost: the formula is (Markup / Cost) * 100%. So the markup is $24.90, cost is $65.05. So 24.90 divided by 65.05 equals... let me compute that.

Hmm, 65.05 times 0.38 is approximately 24.74 (since 65 * 0.38 is 24.7). Wait, 65.05 * 0.3828: let me calculate 65.05 * 0.38. 65 *0.38 is 24.7, 0.05*0.38 is 0.019, so total 24.719. So 24.719 is roughly 24.90? Close, maybe a little more. Alternatively, let me do 24.90 /65.05.

Calculating 24.90 ÷65.05. Let me see, 65.05 goes into 24.90 how many times. Since 65 is bigger than 24, it's less than 1. So 24.90 /65.05 ≈ 0.3828, which is 38.28%. So the markup based on cost is 38.28%.

Now, the second part is markup based on selling price. The formula here is (Markup / Selling Price) *100%. So that's 24.90 divided by 89.95.

Let me compute 24.90 /89.95. Hmm, 90 divided by 90 is 1, so 24.9 is roughly a third of 74.85 (since 74.85 is 0.8333 of 90). Wait, maybe another approach. Let me think, 89.95 is approximately 90. 24.90 is approximately 25. So 25/90 is about 0.2777, which is 27.77%. So the exact value would be a bit less because 89.95 is slightly less than 90 and 24.90 is slightly less than 25.

Let me compute it more accurately. 24.90 ÷89.95. Let me see, 89.95 * x =24.90. So x=24.90 /89.95.

Let me do the division step by step. 24.90 ÷89.95. Hmm, 8995 goes into 24900 how many times. Wait, maybe it's easier to think of both numbers multiplied by 100 to eliminate decimals: 2490 / 8995.

Hmm, let's see. 8995 * 0.27 = ?

8995 *0.2 =1799
8995 *0.07=629.65
So 0.27 gives 1799 +629.65=2428.65. Hmm, 2428.65 is less than 2490. The difference is 2490-2428.65=61.35.

So now, how much more to add. 8995 * x =61.35.

x=61.35/8995 ≈0.00682.

So total x is 0.27 + 0.00682≈0.2768, which is 27.68%.

So the markup based on selling price is approximately 27.68%.

Looking back at the options, option A is 38.28%, 27.68%. So that's the one that matches both calculations.

Wait, let me double-check. Oh, another way: 24.90 divided by 89.95.

If I compute 24.90 /89.95:

Well, 89.95 is approximately 90, so 24.90/90 is 0.27666..., which is about 27.67%, so 27.68% when rounded to two decimal places.

Yes, that matches. So the two percentages are 38.28% and 27.68%, which is option A.

To determine the percent markup based on the cost and the selling price, we start by calculating the markup amount:

\[
\text{Markup} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost} = 89.95 - 65.05 = 24.90
\]

### Markup Based on Cost:
The formula for markup based on cost is:

\[
\text{Markup \% (Cost)} = \left( \frac{\text{Markup}}{\text{Cost}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Markup \% (Cost)} = \left( \frac{24.90}{65.05} \right) \times 100 \approx 38.28\%
\]

### Markup Based on Selling Price:
The formula for markup based on selling price is:

\[
\text{Markup \% (Selling Price)} = \left( \frac{\text{Markup}}{\text{Selling Price}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Markup \% (Selling Price)} = \left( \frac{24.90}{89.95} \right) \times 100 \approx 27.68\%
\]

### Final Answer:
The markup based on cost is approximately **38.28%**, and the markup based on selling price is approximately **27.68%**. Comparing these values with the options provided, the correct choice is:

**A: 38.28%, 27.68%**
