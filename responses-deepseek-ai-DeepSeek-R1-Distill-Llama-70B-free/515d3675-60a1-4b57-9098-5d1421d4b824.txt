Okay, so I have this physics problem here about magnets and poles. Hmm, I remember that magnets have two poles, north and south, and opposite poles attract each other while same poles repel. The problem says that a magnetic south pole with a strength of 15 units is placed 10 cm away from another pole, and it experiences a repulsion of 300 dynes. I need to find out the nature (north or south) and the strength of the second pole from the given options.

Wait, so since the force is a repulsion, that means both poles must be the same type. Because opposite poles attract, same repel. So if the first pole is south, the second must also be south. Or wait, wait—wait, no, no. Wait, if it's a repulsion, then the two poles are the same. So if the first is south, the second must be south as well. Because same poles repel.

But wait, let me double-check that. Yeah, same poles repel, opposite attract. Right.

Now, the problem gives me the strength of one pole, the first one. So the formula for the force between two magnetic poles is F = k * (m1 * m2) / r². I think that's right. Where F is the force, k is Coulomb's constant for magnetism, m1 and m2 are the strengths of the poles, and r is the distance between them.

Wait, but the distance is given in centimeters. Oh, right, I think I need to convert that to meters because usually in these formulas, the unit is meters. So 10 cm is 0.1 meters.

Wait, let me jot down the given values:

m1 = 15 units (south pole)
r = 10 cm = 0.1 m
F = 300 dynes.

Wait, and what's Coulomb's constant for magnetism? I think it's 1 in CGS units when using dynes and units of pole strength. Because in CGS, F is dynes, distance in cm, and units of m in 'pole strength units'. So F = (m1 * m2) / r². Because k is 1. So that's convenient.

So the formula here simplifies to F = (m1 * m2) / r².

We can solve for m2, since we know F, m1, and r.

Plugging in the numbers:

300 = (15 * m2) / (0.1)^2.

Wait, 0.1 squared is 0.01.

So 300 = (15 m2) / 0.01.

Multiply both sides by 0.01:

300 * 0.01 = 15 m2.

3 = 15 m2.

So m2 = 3 / 15 = 0.2? Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, no, wait, 300 * 0.01 is 3, right? So 3 = 15 m2 → m2 = 3/15 = 0.2 units? That's way too small. But the options don't have 0.2. So I must have made a mistake in the calculation.

Wait, let me recalculate. Let me write it step by step. F = (m1 * m2) / r².

We're solving for m2:

m2 = (F * r²) / m1.

So F is 300, r is 0.1 m, m1 is 15.

r squared is 0.01.

So m2 = (300 * 0.01) / 15.

Calculate numerator: 300 * 0.01 is 3.

So 3 divided by 15 is 0.2. Hmm, that's 0.2 units.

But looking at the options, the possible strengths are 500, 1000, 1500, etc. None of them are 0.2. So I must have messed up somewhere.

Wait a minute, perhaps I forgot to convert the distance correctly. Wait, the formula uses meters or centimeters? Oh wait, in CGS units, r is in centimeters. Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. Coulomb's law in magnetism uses the same units as Coulomb's law in electricity. In CGS, the unit of force is dynes, distance in centimeters, and charges (or poles) in appropriate units.

Wait, but I thought the formula is F = k * m1 m2 / r², where k is in CGS units. Let me check: in CGS, the formula for magnetic poles is F = (m1 m2) / r², where F is in dynes, m in units of pole strength, and r in centimeters. So in that case, r is 10 cm, not 0.1 m.

Oh! So I think I made a mistake earlier by converting to meters. So let's correct that.

So r is 10 cm, so r squared is 10^2 = 100 cm².

So F equals (m1 m2) / r².

So 300 = (15 * m2) / 100.

Multiply both sides by 100: 300 * 100 = 15 m2 → 30,000 = 15 m2 → m2 = 2000 units.

Ah, okay, that makes more sense. So the second pole has a strength of 2000 units.

Now, since the force is repulsion, the second pole must be the same as the first. The first is a south pole, so the second is also south. So looking for a south pole with 2000 units.

Looking at the options:

Option D: South pole, 2000 units.

Option J: South pole, 3000.

So option D is 2000, which is what I got.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations again.

Given F = 300, m1 =15, r=10 cm.

So m2 = (F * r²) / m1.

So 300 * 10^2 = 300 * 100 = 30,000.

30,000 divided by 15 is 2000. Yes, correct.

So the second pole is south, 2000 units. So option D.

To solve the problem, we use the formula for the force between two magnetic poles:

\[
F = \frac{m_1 \cdot m_2}{r^2}
\]

where:
- \( F \) is the force in dynes,
- \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) are the strengths of the two poles,
- \( r \) is the distance between the poles in centimeters.

### Step 1: Identify the given values
- \( m_1 = 15 \, \text{units} \) (south pole),
- \( F = 300 \, \text{dynes} \),
- \( r = 10 \, \text{cm} \).

### Step 2: Rearrange the formula to solve for \( m_2 \)
\[
m_2 = \frac{F \cdot r^2}{m_1}
\]

### Step 3: Plug in the values
\[
m_2 = \frac{300 \cdot 10^2}{15}
\]

First, calculate \( r^2 \):
\[
r^2 = 10^2 = 100
\]

Now calculate the numerator:
\[
F \cdot r^2 = 300 \cdot 100 = 30,000
\]

Finally, divide by \( m_1 \):
\[
m_2 = \frac{30,000}{15} = 2000
\]

Thus, the strength of the second pole is \( 2000 \, \text{units} \).

### Step 4: Determine the nature of the second pole
The problem states that the force is a repulsion. Since opposite poles attract and same poles repel, the second pole must be the same type as the first pole, which is a south pole.

### Step 5: Match the result with the options
From the calculations, the second pole is a **south pole with a strength of 2000 units**, which corresponds to **Option D**.
