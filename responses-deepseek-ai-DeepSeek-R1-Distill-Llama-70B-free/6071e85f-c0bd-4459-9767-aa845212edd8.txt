Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question is asking.

The problem gives me three probabilities: P(E) is 0.32, P(F) is 0.15, and P(E ∩ F) is 0.048. I need to figure out the relationship between events E and F. The options talk about whether they're independent, mutually exclusive, dependent, etc. Hmm, right, I remember some key concepts from my notes.

First, I should recall what mutually exclusive means. If two events are mutually exclusive, they can't happen at the same time. So the probability of both happening, P(E ∩ F), should be zero. But in this case, it's given as 0.048, which is not zero. So that rules out mutual exclusivity. So any options that say E and F are mutually exclusive must be wrong. Let me look at the options quickly.

Looking at the options: Option A says mutually exclusive but not independent. But wait, since P(E ∩ F) is not zero, they can't be mutually exclusive. So A is out. Option B also says mutually exclusive, so B is wrong. Option E says dependent and mutually exclusive. No, mutual exclusivity is already out. Option F says independent and mutually exclusive. Again, mutual exclusivity is gone. So any options left that don't involve mutual exclusivity are more likely correct.

Next, I need to check for independence. Two events are independent if the probability of both occurring is equal to the product of their individual probabilities. So I should calculate P(E) * P(F) and see if it equals P(E ∩ F).

P(E) is 0.32, P(F) is 0.15. So multiplying them together: 0.32 * 0.15. Let's do that math. 0.3 times 0.1 is 0.03, 0.3 * 0.05 is 0.015, so adding those for 0.32 * 0.15: wait no, 0.32 * 0.15. Let me compute it correctly. 32 times 15 is 480, and since each has two decimal places, it's 0.048. Oh wait, that's exactly the same as P(E ∩ F), which is 0.048. So that means P(E ∩ F) equals P(E) * P(F), which implies that E and F are independent events.

But wait, earlier I thought mutual exclusivity was out because P(E ∩ F) isn't zero. So now I have that the events are independent. So which options are left?

Looking again:

Option D: dependent but not mutually exclusive. No, because they are independent. So D is incorrect.

Option G: neither independent nor mutually exclusive. No, because they are independent. So G is wrong.

Option H: independent but not mutually exclusive. That fits because P(E ∩ F) is not zero, so they can happen together, so not mutually exclusive, but they are independent.

Option I: neither dependent nor mutually exclusive. No, because they are independent, which is a form of dependence? Wait, no. Wait, if two events are independent, they are not dependent. Wait, I'm getting confused.

Wait, in probability, 'dependent' and 'independent' are opposites. So if E and F are independent, they are not dependent. So option H says they are independent and not mutually exclusive, which would be correct.

Option C: independent and their probabilities are equal. No, because P(E) is 0.32 and P(F) is 0.15. They're not equal. So C is wrong.

Option J: both independent and mutually exclusive. But mutual exclusivity is out, so J is wrong.

So the correct option should be H: independent but not mutually exclusive.

To determine the relationship between events \( E \) and \( F \), we analyze the given probabilities: \( P(E) = 0.32 \), \( P(F) = 0.15 \), and \( P(E \cap F) = 0.048 \).

1. **Mutual Exclusivity**: If two events are mutually exclusive, the probability of both occurring together, \( P(E \cap F) \), must be zero. Since \( P(E \cap F) = 0.048 \), which is not zero, the events are **not mutually exclusive**. This eliminates options A, B, E, F, and J.

2. **Independence**: Two events are independent if \( P(E \cap F) = P(E) \cdot P(F) \). Calculating \( P(E) \cdot P(F) \):
   \[
   P(E) \cdot P(F) = 0.32 \cdot 0.15 = 0.048
   \]
   Since \( P(E \cap F) = 0.048 \), which matches \( P(E) \cdot P(F) \), the events are **independent**.

3. **Final Assessment**: The events are independent and not mutually exclusive. This aligns with option H.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**H: The events \( E \) and \( F \) are independent but not mutually exclusive.**
