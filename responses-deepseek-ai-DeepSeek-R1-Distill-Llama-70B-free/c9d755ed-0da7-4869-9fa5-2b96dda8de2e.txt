Question:

A study is conducted to assess the effectiveness of a new drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. A total of 1000 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are enrolled. Patients are randomly assigned to receive the new drug or standard treatment. The alpha and beta values for calculating probability are 0.05 and 0.20, respectively. Results show that the new drug is significantly better than standard treatment. If this study had been performed in a population of only 500 patients, which of the following would have been most likely to increase?

Options:

A: Chance of a type II error
B: Chance of a false positive result
C: Size of the study population
D: Power of the study
E: Sensitivity of the study
F: Specificity of the study
G: Chance of a false negative result
H: Probability of the alpha value
I: Chance of a type I error

Okay, so I have this question about a clinical study and statistics. Hmm, I need to figure out the right answer. Let me read the question carefully.

The study is about a new drug for type 2 diabetes. They enrolled 1000 patients, randomly assigned to either the new drug or standard treatment. The alpha is 0.05 and beta is 0.20. The results showed the new drug is significantly better. Now, the question is, if the study was done with only 500 patients, what would most likely increase?

The options are A to I. Let me think about what each option means. 

First, I remember that in statistics, alpha is the probability of a Type I error, which is rejecting the null hypothesis when it's actually true. So alpha is the false positive rate. Beta is the probability of a Type II error, which is failing to reject the null when it's false. So beta is the false negative rate.

Power of a study is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it's false. Power is 1 - beta. So if beta is 0.20, power is 0.80 or 80%.

Now, the question says the study had 1000 patients and found the drug effective. If they used only 500, what would happen?

I think sample size affects the power of the study. A larger sample size increases power because you can detect smaller effects. So with a smaller sample (500 instead of 1000), the power would decrease. Wait, but the question is what would increase. So if power decreases, that might relate to the Type II error increasing.

Wait, what's the relationship between sample size and Type II errors? Type II error is failing to detect a difference when there is one. If the study has lower power (because of smaller sample size), it's less able to detect the effect, so the chance of Type II error (beta) increases. So the chance of a Type II error would be higher.

Looking at the options, option A is chance of Type II error. Option G is chance of false negative, which is the same as Type II error. So both A and G are about Type II error.

Wait, but the question is what would increase when the sample size is halved. Originally, the study found the drug better, which suggests that with 1000 patients, they had enough power (80% power). If they used 500, the power would drop. So the probability of Type II error (beta) would increase from 0.20 to something higher. Because beta is the probability of Type II error when the null is false.

So in this case, the chance of a Type II error (failing to find the drug effective when it actually is) would increase. So in the 500-patient study, the chance of Type II error would be higher. So the chance of a false negative result would increase. So looking at the options, A is chance of Type II error and G is chance of false negative. Those are the same thing, but looking at the options, both A and G are present. Wait, no, wait. Let me check the options.

Looking back:

A: Chance of a type II error

G: Chance of a false negative result

So, they're the same. So either A or G would be correct. But the options are listed as separate choices. So perhaps in the options, the correct answer is A.

Wait, but the question is about what would increase when the sample size is reduced. The original study had sufficient power (80%) to detect the effect, meaning a Type II error of 20%. If the sample size decreases, the power decreases, so Type II error increases. So the chance of Type II error (A) would increase. So A is correct.

Wait, but another point: the original study showed significance, so in the smaller study, perhaps they might not detect significance as often. So the probability of a Type II error (failing to detect the effect) would be higher. So the chance of Type II error increases.

Another option is B: chance of false positive. But false positive is Type I error, which is alpha. Alpha is set by the researcher, so it's 0.05 regardless of sample size. So B is not correct.

So the correct answer is A: Chance of a Type II error. Wait, but earlier I thought G is also the same. Let me check the options again.

Looking at the options:

A: Chance of a type II error.

G: Chance of a false negative result.

Yes, they both refer to the same thing. So the answer would be either A or G, but I have to see which is in the options.

Wait, the options are separate. So the question is, which would be most likely to increase.

So when sample size decreases, the power decreases, so the probability of Type II error (beta) increases. So both A and G are correct? But that can't be.

Wait, no. Let me double-check what each option says.

Option A is the chance of a Type II error, which is beta. Option G is the chance of a false negative, which is also beta. So both would be correct. But in the given options, there's both A and G. Hmm, but I think in the options, perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, but the question is about when the sample size is decreased, which is what's happening here. So when the sample size decreases, the power (which is 1 - beta) decreases, so beta increases.

So the chance of a Type II error (option A) increases, and the chance of a false negative (option G) also increases.

Wait, but the options A and G are both present. How? Because the question asks which would be most likely to increase. So perhaps both A and G are correct.

But looking at the answer options, perhaps only one is correct. Let me think again. Wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake.

In the original study with 1000 patients, they found the drug effective. So that means they correctly rejected the null hypothesis. If the sample size was 500, perhaps the effect would be harder to detect, so they might not have found significance. So the chance of a Type II error (failing to reject when they should) would increase.

So yes, in a smaller sample, Type II errors are more likely.

So the correct answer is A: Chance of a type II error.

But wait, the options are:

A: Chance of a type II error

G: Chance of a false negative result.

Wait, both are Type II errors. So why are they separate options? Because the question is probably testing understanding of the terms. So perhaps the correct answer is A, or maybe G.

Wait, perhaps I should think about the definitions again. Type II error is a false negative. So if the study has a smaller sample, the chance of a Type II error (false negative) increases.

So in that case, both A and G are correct. But the options are separate. So perhaps both are correct, but the options are structured so that only one is.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The question is what would increase when the sample size is reduced. The power decreases, so the chance of Type II error increases.

So the correct answer is A: Chance of a type II error.

Wait, but the question says the study found the new drug significantly better. If you have a smaller sample, you might not have enough power to detect the effect, so you might not find significance. So in that case, the Type II error (failing to detect when there is an effect) would increase.

So the correct answer is A.

When the sample size of a study is reduced, the power of the study decreases. Power is the probability of correctly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is false, and it is calculated as \(1 - \beta\), where \(\beta\) is the probability of a Type II error. A Type II error occurs when a study fails to detect an effect that is actually present, which is also known as a false negative result.

In this scenario, the original study with 1000 patients had sufficient power (80%, as \(\beta = 0.20\)) to detect the effectiveness of the new drug. However, if the sample size is halved to 500 patients, the power of the study would decrease, making it harder to detect the effect. As a result, the probability of a Type II error (\(\beta\)) would increase, meaning the chance of failing to detect the drug's effectiveness when it is truly effective would rise.

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Chance of a type II error** — This is correct because reducing the sample size increases the likelihood of a Type II error.
- **B: Chance of a false positive result** — This is incorrect because the false positive rate (\(\alpha\)) is set by the researcher (0.05 in this case) and is independent of sample size.
- **C: Size of the study population** — This is incorrect because the study population is being reduced, not increased.
- **D: Power of the study** — This is incorrect because power decreases with a smaller sample size.
- **E: Sensitivity of the study** — This is incorrect because sensitivity (the ability to detect true positives) decreases with reduced sample size.
- **F: Specificity of the study** — This is incorrect because specificity (the ability to detect true negatives) is not directly affected by sample size.
- **G: Chance of a false negative result** — This is correct because a false negative result is synonymous with a Type II error, and the chance of this increases with a smaller sample size.
- **H: Probability of the alpha value** — This is incorrect because \(\alpha\) is fixed at 0.05 and is not affected by sample size.
- **I: Chance of a type I error** — This is incorrect because the Type I error rate (\(\alpha\)) is fixed and independent of sample size.

Both **A** and **G** are correct because they refer to the same concept: the increased likelihood of a Type II error (or false negative result) when the sample size is reduced. However, since the question asks for the most likely increase and the options are structured as separate choices, the best answer is:

**A: Chance of a type II error**
