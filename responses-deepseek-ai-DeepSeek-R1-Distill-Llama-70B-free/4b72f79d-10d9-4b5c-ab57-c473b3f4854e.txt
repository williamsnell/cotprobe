Question:

A law school advertised in various law journals for a legal ethics and jurisprudence professor. Although a number of lawyers applied for the position, one of the applicants submitted a particularly impressive resume. The dean of faculty for the law school immediately wrote to the applicant to offer him the position. In the letter, the dean offered to employ the applicant for the upcoming academic year, which started on August 15, at a salary of $75,000. The letter also listed the employment terms and conditions, one of which stated that professors are entitled to five paid sick days during the year. The dean included a detailed employment contract containing all these terms, for the applicant's signature. After the applicant received this letter, he replied by mail, requesting a salary of $85,000 and sick leave of 10 days. Upon receipt of the applicant's letter, the dean telephoned the applicant and told him that the law school followed the American Bar Association guidelines with respect to salary and sick leave for its professors. The applicant acquiesced on the salary question, but insisted that his sick leave be extended to 10 days. The dean replied, "Let's not permit a minor issue to stand in the way of your coming to teach at our law school. In the event you require more than 5 sick days, I promise that the matter will be taken care of to your benefit. " The applicant informed the dean that he would sign the contract and forward it to the dean, which he promptly did. The applicant began teaching at the law school on August 15. Three months later, the applicant was out sick for five days with laryngitis. The applicant did not miss another school day until Monday, March 8, when he fell ill with food poisoning. This illness kept him home for five additional sick days. The applicant returned to work on March 15. When the applicant received his salary check at the end of the week, his check did not include payment for the previous week (from March 8 to March 12). Accompanying the check was a statement that read:"Salary payment for period from Monday, March 1 through Friday, March 19 with pro rata deduction to reflect five teaching days missed during said period. "When the applicant received his check, he immediately confronted the dean and requested full payment for the week of March 8 through 12. The dean responded, "I'm sorry, but there is absolutely nothing I can do about it. "The applicant asserted a claim against the law school for breach of contract. The applicant offers to introduce evidence that during his telephone conversation with dean of faculty, the dean promised, if necessary, to provide him with additional sick days. The most accurate statement concerning the dean's oral promise would be that

Options:

A: parol evidence is admissible to show that the parties assented to their written contract only as a partial integration of their complete contract.
B: parol evidence is admissible to prove the written contract was a mistake.
C: parol evidence is admissible to show the dean's personal guarantee of additional sick days.
D: parol evidence is admissible to show that the written contract was void due to lack of consideration.
E: parol evidence is inadmissible to prove any oral agreements made prior to the signing of the written contract.
F: parol evidence is admissible to show that the applicant misunderstood the terms of the contract.
G: parol evidence is admissible to prove the dean coerced the applicant into signing the contract.
H: parol evidence is admissible to show that the written contract is not enforceable, because of undue influence or fraud.
I: parol evidence is inadmissible to prove contemporaneous oral agreements that vary or contradict the terms of a written contract.

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this contract law question. Let me read through it carefully. 

The situation is about a law school hiring a professor. The dean offers the job with certain terms, including a salary and five sick days. The applicant negotiates a bit, asking for a higher salary and more sick days. The dean agrees to the salary as per ABA guidelines but only offers five sick days. However, the dean verbally promises that if the applicant needs more sick days, it'll be taken care of. The applicant then signs the contract and starts working. Later, when he uses more than five sick days, the school doesn't pay him for those extra days. He sues, claiming breach of contract, and wants to introduce evidence of the dean's oral promise.

The question is about the admissibility of that oral promise as parol evidence. The options are about what the dean's promise means in terms of parol evidence rules.

I remember that the parol evidence rule generally says that when a written contract is intended to be the final and complete agreement (integration), prior or contemporaneous oral agreements that contradict or vary the written terms are not admissible. This is to prevent parties from introducing oral statements that could alter the written contract, ensuring reliability and preventing disputes.

In this case, the written contract includes five sick days. The oral promise was about additional days being taken care of. So the applicant is trying to use this promise to say that the contract should have more sick days paid.

I think the key here is whether the written contract was fully integrated. If it's a complete integration, any prior or contemporaneous oral agreements that contradict it are inadmissible. But if it's only partially integrated, then parol evidence could be used for other terms.

Looking at the options:

Option A says parol evidence can show partial integration. That would mean the written contract isn't the entire agreement, so other terms could be considered. But I'm not sure if that's the case here because the contract seems comprehensive.

Option B talks about mistake. There's no indication that the contract was mistaken, so probably not.

Option C suggests it's a personal guarantee. The dean's promise might be seen as a personal promise, not part of the contract. But if the promise was about the contract terms, maybe it's not just a personal guarantee.

Option D is about lack of consideration. Not relevant here; the contract has consideration.

Option E says parol evidence is inadmissible for prior oral agreements. That's the general rule if the written contract is fully integrated.

Option F is about misunderstanding. The rule usually doesn't allow parol evidence for misunderstandings unless it's about fraud or mistake.

Option G is coercion. There's no indication the applicant was coerced, so probably not.

Option H is undue influence or fraud. Again, no evidence of that in the scenario.

Option I says parol evidence can't be used to vary terms, which aligns with the parol evidence rule when there's a fully integrated contract.

So, the written contract included the five sick days. The oral promise by the dean was about additional days, which contradicts the written term. Since the contract is likely a full integration, the parol evidence rule would bar the introduction of the oral promise to vary the terms.

Wait, but the applicant might argue that the contract wasn't fully integrated because the dean's promise was contemporaneous. But I think the parol evidence rule applies to contemporaneous agreements that contradict the written terms. So the answer would be that parol evidence is inadmissible to vary the terms, making option I correct.

Alternatively, if the contract wasn't fully integrated, option A could apply. But the contract seems to include detailed terms, so likely full integration.

So the correct answer is probably I.

The question revolves around the admissibility of parol evidence regarding an oral promise made by the dean to the applicant. The dean's promise to "take care of" additional sick days beyond the five specified in the written contract is central to the issue. Under the parol evidence rule, when a written contract is intended as a complete and final agreement (full integration), prior or contemporaneous oral agreements that contradict or vary the written terms are generally inadmissible. 

In this case, the written contract explicitly states five paid sick days, and the dean's oral promise about additional sick days directly contradicts this term. Since the contract appears to be fully integrated, the parol evidence rule would bar the introduction of the oral promise to alter the written terms. Therefore, the most accurate statement is that parol evidence is inadmissible to prove contemporaneous oral agreements that vary or contradict the terms of a written contract.
