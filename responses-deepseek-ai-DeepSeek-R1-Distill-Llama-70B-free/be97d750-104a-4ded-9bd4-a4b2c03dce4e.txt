Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about coffee consumption in the United States. The question is asking how many cups of coffee were consumed in the past week as of 2013. The options are from A to J, each with different numbers.

Hmm, I'm not exactly sure about the exact figures, but I remember hearing some stats about coffee consumption. I think the US is a big coffee-drinking country. Let me try to recall. I remember that the average American drinks around 2-3 cups of coffee a day. But wait, that's per person, right? But how many people are we talking about?

The US population as of 2013 was around 313 million people. If the average is about 2.5 cups per day, then per week that would be 2.5 * 7 = 17.5 cups per person. Multiply that by 313 million people... that's a huge number. Let me do the math. 17.5 cups/week * 313 million people. 17.5 * 313 is... let's see, 17 * 313 is 5,321 and 0.5*313 is 156.5, so total 5,321 + 156.5 = 5,477.5 million cups per week. Wait, that's 5.4775 billion cups per week. So looking at the options, option J is 5 billion, which is close. But wait, did I make a mistake in my calculation?

Wait, maybe my average per person is off. Maybe it's not 2.5 cups a day. I think I've heard that the average is around 2.1 cups per day for coffee drinkers, but not everyone drinks coffee daily. So maybe the per capita consumption is a bit lower. Let me think again. Suppose 60% of adults drink coffee daily, and the average is 2.5 cups. So 0.6 * 2.5 = 1.5 cups per person per day in the population. Then per week, that's 1.5 *7 =10.5 cups per week. Multiply by 313 million: 10.5 * 313 million = 3,286.5 million cups, which is about 3.2865 billion. Oh, that's around 3.3 billion, which would be close to option B (3 billion) or option E (6 billion). Wait, that doesn't add up because 3.3 is closer to B but I thought earlier I got 5.4 billion.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look for another approach. I remember that the total coffee consumption in the US is often cited as around 400 million cups per day. If that's the case, then per week it's 400 million *7 = 2.8 billion cups. So that's about 2.8 billion, which would be closest to option B (3 billion) or option H (4 billion). But I'm not sure where I got the 400 million figure from.

Alternatively, I've heard that the US consumes about 1.3 cups of coffee per person per day. So 1.3 *7 =9.1 cups per week per person. Multiply by 313 million: 9.1 *313 million = let's see, 9 *313 is 2,817 million, 0.1 *313 is 31.3 million, total 2,848.3 million, so approximately 2.8 billion cups per week. That again points towards option B (3 billion) or maybe H (4 billion), but 2.8 is closer to 3.

Wait, another angle: I think the NCA (National Coffee Association) releases data on coffee consumption. From what I remember, in 2013, the average daily consumption was around 2.1 cups per person for coffee drinkers, but not everyone drinks coffee. So let's say about 60% of adults drink coffee daily. So 0.6 * 2.1 =1.26 cups per person per day. Multiply by 7 days: 8.82 cups per week. Then 8.82 * 313 million people is approximately 2,759 million cups, which is about 2.76 billion. So again, around 2.8 billion, which is close to 3 billion, option B.

But wait, another thought: sometimes the numbers are reported as total cups, not per person. I think I've heard that the US consumes about 400 million cups of coffee every day. So 400 million *7 =2.8 billion per week. That's consistent with what I calculated before. So 2.8 billion is close to option B (3 billion) and option H (4 billion). But 2.8 is closer to 3.

Wait, looking back at the options: option B is 3 billion, option H is 4 billion. So 2.8 is closer to 3, which would be option B.

But wait, I'm a bit unsure because I remember seeing a statistic that the US consumes around 5 billion cups per week, which would be option J (5 billion). How does that fit in?

Alternatively, maybe the 400 million cups per day is the total, so 400 million *7 =2.8 billion per week, which would be option B.

But I'm now a bit confused because different sources might report different numbers. Let me try to think of other factors. Maybe some sources include both at-home and away-from-home consumption, others might not. Or perhaps the numbers are higher if they include all age groups, not just adults.

Wait, I think the 400 million cups per day figure comes from the NCA's 2013 report. So 400 million per day *7=2.8 billion per week. That would make option B (3 billion) the closest.

Alternatively, maybe I'm mixing up the numbers with something else. For example, tea consumption is higher, but coffee is significant.

I think I've made a mistake earlier when I calculated based on per person consumption. Let me try that again. If the US has about 313 million people, and if each person consumes, say, 2 cups a week, that's 626 million cups per week, which is way lower than the options given. So that approach must be wrong.

Wait, no, that can't be right because 2 cups per week would be too low. The correct approach is to find the total cups, not per person.

Wait, perhaps I need to look for the total number of cups consumed in the US per week. I think I've read that the US consumes about 1.3 cups of coffee per person per day. So 1.3 *7=9.1 cups per week. Multiply by 313 million people: 9.1 *313 = approx 2,850 million, so 2.85 billion cups per week. That's close to 3 billion, option B.

So based on that, the answer should be option B: 3 billion cups per week.

Wait, but earlier I thought about 400 million cups per day, which is 2.8 billion per week—again, close to 3 billion.

Alternatively, if it's 500 million cups per day, that would be 3.5 billion per week, which would be closer to option J:5 billion, but that's a stretch.

Wait, I think I'm getting this wrong. Let me try a different approach. Let's say the average American drinks about 2 cups per day. 2 cups/day *7 days =14 cups/week per person. Multiply by 313 million: 14 *313 =4,382 million cups per week, which is 4.382 billion. That would be close to option H:4 billion, but I'm not sure if that's accurate.

Wait, maybe the correct figure is 1.3 cups per day per person. So 1.3 *7=9.1 cups/week. 9.1 *313 million = let's calculate that.

313 million is 313,000,000.

9.1 * 313,000,000 = ?

Let me compute 9 *313,000,000 = 2,817,000,000.

0.1 *313,000,000 =31,300,000.

Total is 2,817,000,000 +31,300,000 =2,848,300,000 cups per week, which is about 2.848 billion. So that's about 2.8 billion, which is close to 3 billion, option B.

But I'm a bit confused because I've heard higher numbers before. Wait, maybe the 1.3 cups per person per day is an underestimate. Let me check another angle. If the total is 2.8 billion cups per week, that would mean each person in the US (including children) drinks about 2.8 billion /313 million = approx 8.95 cups per week, which is about 1.27 cups per day. That seems plausible.

So I think option B (3 billion) is the correct answer.

The question asks how many cups of coffee were consumed in the United States in the past week as of 2013. To determine the correct answer, several approaches were considered:

1. **Per Person Consumption**: It was estimated that the average American drinks around 1.3 cups of coffee per day. Multiplying this by 7 days gives approximately 9.1 cups per week per person. For a population of 313 million, this results in roughly 2.85 billion cups per week.

2. **Total Daily Consumption**: Another approach considered the total daily consumption, with a figure of 400 million cups per day. Multiplying this by 7 days yields approximately 2.8 billion cups per week.

3. **Comparison of Options**: The calculated values of 2.8–2.85 billion cups per week align closely with option B (3 billion cups per week). Other options, such as 5 billion or 4 billion, were considered but found to be less consistent with the calculations.

Based on these considerations, the most accurate answer is **option B: 3 billion cups per week**.
