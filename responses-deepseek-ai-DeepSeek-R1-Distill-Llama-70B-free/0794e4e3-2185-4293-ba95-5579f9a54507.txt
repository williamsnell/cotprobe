Okay, so I have this biology question about fertilization results, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what I remember from my classes.

The question is asking what the results of fertilization are, with options from A to J. I'll try to break it down.

Fertilization is when a sperm and an egg cell combine. I remember that this process does a couple of key things. First, it restores the diploid state. Human cells are typically diploid, meaning they have two sets of chromosomes (one from each parent). But the sperm and egg are haploid, each with one set. When they combine, the resulting cell, the zygote, has two sets again. So that's diploid restoration.

Then, after fertilization, the zygote starts to divide. This division is called cleavage, right? It's a series of mitotic divisions without much growth, just splitting into more cells. So initiation of zygote cleavage is another result.

Sex determination also happens at fertilization. The sex of the baby depends on whether the sperm contributed an X or Y chromosome. So the moment the sperm meets the egg determines if it's a boy or girl.

Species variation comes into play because fertilization usually involves the union of two different gametes (sperm and egg). This mixing of genetic material increases genetic diversity. Wait, but option F says "species variation," which I think refers to the variation within the species due to genetic recombination. So that's another point.

Looking at the options, option F says: Restoration of diploid state, initiation of zygote cleavage, sex determination, and species variation. That seems to cover all the points I thought of.

Wait, let me think about the other options to make sure. 

Option A: Creation of new cells. Well, fertilization itself doesn't create new cells yet. The zygote is the first cell, and cleavage comes after. So maybe A is part of the process but not the immediate result.

Option B: Initiation of meiosis in the zygote. No, meiosis occurs in the production of gametes, not in the zygote. The zygote undergoes mitosis.

Option C: Production of energy. That doesn't sound right. Fertilization isn't primarily about energy production.

Option D: Immediate growth into a fetus. No, that's way later. After cleavage comes the embryo, then later it becomes a fetus.

Option E: Formation of identical twins every time. No, identical twins happen when a zygote splits, but it's not a guaranteed result of fertilization.

Option G: Decrease in genetic diversity. No, fertilization usually increases diversity because of the mixing of genes.

Option H: Duplication of DNA without variation. No, because crossing over and different gametes lead to variations.

Option I: Initiation of mitosis. Well, the zygote will start mitosis soon (cleavage), so maybe that's covered in F's "initiation of zygote cleavage."

Option J: Conversion of somatic into germ cells. That doesn't happen. Fertilization involves germ cells (sperm and egg) fusing, not somatic cells converting.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be option F.

The results of fertilization include the restoration of the diploid state, as the fusion of a haploid sperm and egg results in a diploid zygote. This event also initiates zygote cleavage, a series of mitotic divisions that begin the development of the embryo. Additionally, fertilization determines the sex of the offspring, as the sperm contributes either an X or Y chromosome. Lastly, fertilization contributes to species variation by mixing genetic material from the two parents, increasing genetic diversity.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Incorrect. Fertilization creates the zygote, but new cells are formed later through cleavage.
- **B**: Incorrect. Meiosis occurs in gamete formation, not in the zygote.
- **C**: Incorrect. Fertilization is not about energy production.
- **D**: Incorrect. Growth into a fetus occurs much later in development.
- **E**: Incorrect. Identical twins are not a guaranteed result of fertilization.
- **F**: Correct. Covers diploid restoration, zygote cleavage, sex determination, and species variation.
- **G**: Incorrect. Fertilization increases genetic diversity.
- **H**: Incorrect. Genetic variation is introduced during fertilization.
- **I**: Incorrect. While mitosis begins after fertilization, this is part of zygote cleavage.
- **J**: Incorrect. Fertilization involves germ cells, not somatic cells.

Thus, the correct answer is:

**Answer: F**
