The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A farmer purchased a new pickup truck from a local automobile dealership. A few weeks later, the farmer was using the truck to haul a load of supplies to his farm. As he drove down a small hill toward an intersection with a stop sign, he applied the brakes, but they failed to work, and the truck did not slow down. The farmer could not stop for the stop sign. He saw a pedestrian crossing the street at the intersection and tried to steer around him, but was unable to do so. The pickup truck struck the pedestrian and seriously injured him. If the injured pedestrian asserts a negligence claim against the auto dealership that sold the truck to the farmer, and if it is conclusively proven that the brake failure resulted from a manufacturing defect in the car, will the pedestrian prevail?

Options:

A: No, because the pedestrian was not a purchaser or user of the truck.
B: Yes, if the manufacturing company had issued a recall for the defect.
C: No, if the farmer was speeding and therefore could not stop in time.
D: Yes, if the defect could have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable care by the auto dealer.
E: No, if the pedestrian was crossing the street illegally.
F: No, if the farmer was negligent in being unable to steer around and avoid hitting the pedestrian.
G: Yes, if the auto dealer was aware of the defect but did not inform the farmer.
H: No, because the farmer should have had the truck inspected before using it for heavy duty work.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this negligence question. Let me start by reading it carefully.

The scenario is that a farmer bought a new pickup truck from a dealership. A few weeks later, he was driving it down a hill, hauling supplies. He applied the brakes, but they failed, so the truck didn't slow down. He couldn't stop for a stop sign ahead. He saw a pedestrian crossing and tried to steer around him but couldn't, so the truck hit the pedestrian, causing serious injury.

Now, the pedestrian is suing the auto dealership for negligence. It's proven that the brake failure was due to a manufacturing defect.

The question is, will the pedestrian prevail? The options are A through H.

First, I remember that negligence requires four elements: duty, breach, causation, and damages. So the pedestrian needs to show that the dealership owed a duty, breached it, which caused the injury, and there were damages.

The dealership sold the truck, which had a manufacturing defect. So the brake failure was due to this defect, which the manufacturer is responsible for. But the lawsuit is against the dealership, not the manufacturer. So what's the dealership's liability here?

I'm thinking about product liability. Typically, the manufacturer, distributor, and seller can all be held strictly liable for product defects under strict liability theory. But this question is about negligence, not strict liability.

In negligence, a seller or dealer might be liable if they knew or should have known about the defect. So if the dealer didn't know about the defect and had no reason to know, maybe they aren't liable. But if they should have discovered it through reasonable care, then maybe they are.

Looking at the options:

Option D says "Yes, if the defect could have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable care by the auto dealer." That seems to align with the idea that the dealer had a duty to inspect or know about the defect. If they should have found it, then they breached their duty.

Option G says "Yes, if the auto dealer was aware of the defect but did not inform the farmer." That's about actual knowledge, which is a higher bar. But the question says it's proven the defect was from manufacturing, not that the dealer knew.

Option A says "No, because the pedestrian was not a purchaser or user." But in product liability, the duty extends to foreseeable users, so the pedestrian, as a third party, could still sue. So A might not be correct.

Option B is about a recall. If the manufacturer issued a recall, maybe the dealer should have known. But the question doesn't mention a recall, so this might be irrelevant unless it's a condition.

Option C talks about the farmer speeding. That's a possible defense, but the question is about the dealership's liability, not the farmer's. So even if the farmer was negligent, the dealership's own negligence could still make them liable.

Option E says no if the pedestrian was crossing illegally. That's about the pedestrian's own actions, but contributory negligence would depend on the jurisdiction. However, many places use comparative negligence, but I don't think that directly affects the dealer's liability for the defect.

Option F is about the farmer's negligence in steering. Again, that's about the farmer, not the dealer. So that wouldn't absolve the dealer.

Option H suggests the farmer should have inspected. That's about the farmer's possible negligence, but not the dealer's.

So back to the main point: the dealer's duty. If the defect was present when the truck was sold, and the dealer failed to discover it when they should have (exercised reasonable care), then the dealer could be negligent.

So the correct answer would depend on whether the dealer could have discovered the defect with reasonable care. If they could, then they breached their duty. Hence, option D seems correct.

Wait, but in strict liability, the seller can be liable even without fault, but this question is about negligence. So the dealer's negligence would be in not discovering the defect that they could have with reasonable care.

So yes, if the defect could have been discovered through reasonable care, then the dealer is liable. So the pedestrian would prevail in that case, making D the correct answer.

To determine whether the pedestrian will prevail in a negligence claim against the auto dealership, we must analyze the elements of negligence: duty, breach, causation, and damages. The dealership, as a seller, has a duty to ensure that the products they sell are safe for their intended use. A breach of this duty occurs if the dealership fails to exercise reasonable care in discovering defects that could pose a risk to users.

The question specifies that the brake failure was due to a manufacturing defect. Under negligence law, the dealership could be held liable if it is shown that the defect could have been discovered through the exercise of reasonable care. This means that if a reasonable inspection or investigation by the dealership would have uncovered the defect, the dealership may have breached its duty of care.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** is incorrect because the duty of care extends to foreseeable users of the product, including third parties like the pedestrian.
- **Option B** is irrelevant unless a recall is proven, which is not stated in the question.
- **Option C** and **Option F** focus on the farmer's actions, which do not absolve the dealership of its own potential negligence.
- **Option E** concerns the pedestrian's actions, which may affect contributory negligence but does not negate the dealership's duty.
- **Option G** requires actual knowledge of the defect, which is a higher standard than what is required for negligence.
- **Option H** shifts blame to the farmer but does not address the dealership's duty to exercise reasonable care.

The correct answer hinges on whether the dealership could have discovered the defect through reasonable care. If so, the dealership breached its duty, making **Option D** the correct choice.
