The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

A woman owned land in fee simple absolute. The woman conveyed the land to a friend "for life," and when the friend died the land was to go to the woman's neighbor "and her heirs." The neighbor died and in her duly probated will devised her entire estate to a local charity. If she had died intestate, her daughter would have been her only heir. One year after the neighbor died, her daughter executed a quitclaim deed conveying any interest she might have in the land to the woman's friend. The common law Rule Against Perpetuities is unmodified in the jurisdiction. There are no other applicable statutes. Who has what interest in the land?

Options:

A: The friend has a life estate and the woman has a reversion, because the neighbor's remainder was void under the Rule Against Perpetuities.
B: The friend has a fee simple absolute, because his life estate merged with the remainder conveyed to him by the daughter.
C: The friend has a life estate and the charity has a contingent remainder, because the neighbor's interest was devisable and her will transferred her entire estate.
D: The friend has a fee simple absolute, because the quitclaim deed from the daughter transferred any interest she might have had in the land.
E: The friend has a life estate and the daughter has a contingent remainder, because the deed from the woman created an interest in the neighbor's heirs.
F: The friend has a life estate and the daughter has a vested remainder, because the deed from the woman created an interest in the neighbor's heirs.
G: The friend has a life estate and the woman's neighbor has a vested remainder, because the deed from the woman created an interest in the neighbor.
H: The friend has a life estate and the charity has a vested remainder, because the neighbor's interest was devisable.
I: The friend has a life estate and the local charity has a contingent remainder, because the neighbor's will transferred her entire estate.
J: The friend has a life estate and the woman's neighbor has a contingent remainder, because the neighbor's will devised her entire estate to a local charity.

Okay, so I'm trying to tackle this property law question, and honestly, it's a bit confusing, but I'll try to break it down step by step. Let me start by reading the question carefully.

So, the setup is that a woman owns land in fee simple absolute. She conveys it to her friend "for life," and upon the friend's death, the land is supposed to go to the woman's neighbor "and her heirs." Then, the neighbor dies, and in her will, she leaves her entire estate to a local charity. If she had died intestate, her daughter would have been her only heir. After the neighbor dies, her daughter executes a quitclaim deed conveying any interest she might have in the land to the woman's friend. The jurisdiction follows the common law Rule Against Perpetuities without any modifications or other statutes.

The question is asking who has what interest in the land.

I need to figure out the interests each party has. Let's start by analyzing the conveyance.

The woman conveys the land to her friend for life. That means the friend has a life estate. The next part says when the friend dies, the land goes to the neighbor and her heirs. So that sounds like the neighbor is getting a future interest. But what kind?

I think that when you convey land to someone for life, then to another and their heirs, the second part is a remainder. Specifically, since it's to the neighbor and her heirs, it's a vested remainder in fee simple. Because when the friend dies, the neighbor (or her heirs) takes it immediately. So the neighbor has a vested remainder.

But wait, the neighbor died. So what happens to her remainder? Well, the neighbor's vested remainder becomes part of her estate. She can devise it in her will. So in her will, she gave her entire estate to the charity. So the charity would take the remainder, right? So the charity has a vested remainder.

But wait, the neighbor died. The friend is still alive because the conveyance is for the friend's life. So the current interests are the friend's life estate, and the charity's vested remainder.

But then, the daughter of the neighbor executed a quitclaim deed to the friend, conveying any interest she might have. Wait, why would the daughter have any interest? Because if the neighbor had died intestate, the daughter would have been her only heir. But the neighbor died testate, devising everything to charity. So the daughter doesn't have any interest because the neighbor's will took effect. So the daughter's quitclaim deed wouldn't transfer anything because she had nothing to convey.

So the interests are: friend has a life estate, charity has a vested remainder in fee simple.

But wait, is there any issue with the Rule Against Perpetuities? Let's think. The original conveyance was to the friend for life, then to the neighbor and her heirs. So the neighbor's remainder is a vested remainder because it's not subject to any condition; it's just to follow the friend's death. So it's a vested remainder and not subject to the Rule Against Perpetuities because it's certain to vest, if at all, within a life in being plus 21 years. The measuring life would be the friend, so when the friend dies, the remainder vests. So no RAP issue.

Wait, but the problem says that the neighbor died, and the daughter executed a quitclaim deed to the friend. So maybe the daughter thought she had an interest, but she doesn't. So the friend's life estate continues, and upon his death, the land goes to the charity.

Looking at the options:

Option C: Friend has life estate, charity has contingent remainder. No, because the remainder was vested when the neighbor took it.

Option H: Friend has life estate, charity has vested remainder.

Yes, that seems correct. Let me check the options again.

Option H says: The friend has a life estate and the charity has a vested remainder, because the neighbor's interest was devisable.

Yes, that fits.

Wait, but let me look again. The options are:

H: friend life estate, charity vested remainder.

Yes, that's what I concluded.

But wait, what about the quitclaim deed from the daughter? Does that affect anything? The daughter had no interest because the neighbor's will gave everything to charity. So the daughter's deed is irrelevant; she had nothing to convey. So the friend's life estate remains, and the charity holds the vested remainder.

So the correct answer is option H.
</think>

The woman conveyed the land to her friend for life, giving the friend a life estate. The remaining interest was conveyed to the neighbor and her heirs, creating a vested remainder in fee simple for the neighbor. When the neighbor died, her vested remainder passed to her estate and was devised to the charity through her will. The daughter, who would have been the heir if the neighbor had died intestate, had no interest to convey because the neighbor's will effectively transferred the entire estate to the charity. The quitclaim deed from the daughter to the friend is irrelevant, as the daughter had no interest to transfer.

The Rule Against Perpetuities is not implicated here because the neighbor's vested remainder was certain to vest, if at all, within the lifetime of the friend, who is a life in being. Therefore, the friend holds a life estate, and the charity holds a vested remainder in fee simple.

The correct answer is:

H: The friend has a life estate and the charity has a vested remainder, because the neighbor's interest was devisable.

Answer: H
