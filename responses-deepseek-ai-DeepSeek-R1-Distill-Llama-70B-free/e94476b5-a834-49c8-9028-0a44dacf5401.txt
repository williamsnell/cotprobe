Question:

Grey's Truck Rental Service currently charges $180 per week for the use of one of their moving trucks. Presently, Ms. Grey is renting out an average of 200 trucks per week. She estimates there will be a drop in demand of 1 truck per week if she raises the rental price by $1 a truck. What is the price that will maximize revenues?

Options:

A: $210
B: $180
C: $200
D: $220
E: $205
F: $230
G: $215
H: $190
I: $195
J: $175

Okay, so I've got this problem here about Grey's Truck Rental Service, and I'm supposed to figure out the price that will maximize their revenues. Hmm, let's see. I remember from my economics class that revenue is basically the product of price and quantity sold. So, Revenue = Price × Quantity.

The problem says that currently, they charge $180 per week and rent out an average of 200 trucks each week. Now, Ms. Grey is thinking about raising the price, but she expects that for every dollar she increases the price, the demand will drop by one truck per week. My goal is to find the price that maximizes their revenue.

Alright, so I need to model this situation mathematically. Let's think about how price and quantity relate here. Let me denote the price as P and the quantity as Q. Currently, P is $180, and Q is 200.

If she raises the price by $x, then the new price becomes P_new = 180 + x. But for each $1 increase, the quantity demanded drops by 1 truck. So, the new quantity Q_new would be 200 - x. Because for every x dollars she adds, she loses x trucks in rentals.

Now, revenue R is P_new multiplied by Q_new. So,

R = (180 + x) * (200 - x)

I need to find the value of x that maximizes R. To do that, I should expand this equation and then find its maximum point, probably by finding the vertex of the parabola since this is a quadratic equation.

Expanding the equation:

R = 180*200 + 180*(-x) + x*200 + x*(-x)
Wait, that might not be the quickest way. Let me calculate it step by step.

R = (180 + x) * (200 - x)
Multiply them out:

180*200 = 36,000
180*(-x) = -180x
x*200 = 200x
x*(-x) = -x²

So adding all these terms together:

R = 36,000 - 180x + 200x - x²
Combine like terms:

-180x + 200x = 20x

So R = 36,000 + 20x - x²

Which can be rewritten as:

R = -x² + 20x + 36,000

This is a quadratic equation in the form of R = ax² + bx + c. Here, a is -1, b is 20, and c is 36,000. The graph of this equation is a downward-opening parabola, so the maximum point is at the vertex.

The vertex of a parabola given by ax² + bx + c is at x = -b/(2a). Let me plug in the values:

x = -20 / (2*(-1)) = -20 / (-2) = 10.

So x is 10. This means that the price should be increased by $10 to maximize revenue.

Wait, wait. The original price was $180. So adding $10 would make the new price $190.

Wait, but looking back at the options, let me check if $190 is one of them. Let me look at the options again. The options are A:210, B:180, C:200, D:220, E:205, F:230, G:215, H:190, I:195, J:175.

Yes, option H is $190. So the correct answer should be H.

But wait, did I make a mistake? Let me double-check my calculations. I used x as the increase in price, which leads to a decrease in quantity by x. So R = (180 + x)(200 - x). Expanded correctly, R = -x² + 20x + 36,000. The vertex is at x = -b/(2a) = -20/(2*(-1)) = 10. So x is 10, so the price is 180+10=190.

Yes, that seems correct. So the answer is H: $190.

To determine the price that maximizes revenue for Grey's Truck Rental Service, we start by defining the relationship between price and quantity. Currently, the price \( P \) is $180, and the quantity \( Q \) is 200 trucks per week. If the price is increased by $\( x \), the new price becomes \( P_{\text{new}} = 180 + x \), and the quantity demanded decreases to \( Q_{\text{new}} = 200 - x \).

Revenue \( R \) is the product of price and quantity:

\[
R = (180 + x)(200 - x)
\]

Expanding this equation:

\[
R = 180 \cdot 200 + 180 \cdot (-x) + x \cdot 200 + x \cdot (-x)
\]

\[
R = 36,000 - 180x + 200x - x^2
\]

Combining like terms:

\[
R = -x^2 + 20x + 36,000
\]

This is a quadratic equation in the form \( R = ax^2 + bx + c \), where \( a = -1 \), \( b = 20 \), and \( c = 36,000 \). The maximum revenue occurs at the vertex of the parabola, which is given by:

\[
x = -\frac{b}{2a}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
x = -\frac{20}{2(-1)} = -\frac{20}{-2} = 10
\]

Thus, the price should be increased by $10. The new price is:

\[
P_{\text{new}} = 180 + 10 = 190
\]

Checking the options, $190 corresponds to option H. Therefore, the price that maximizes revenue is **$190**.
