Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let me read it carefully. The question is about events where groups of sellers meet collectively to attract buyers. Hmm, I need to pick the correct option from A to J.

Alright, let me go through each option one by one. 

Option A is Direct mail campaigns. That's when companies send letters or emails directly to potential customers. But that doesn't involve groups of sellers meeting, so probably not A.

Option B is Teleconferencing. That's like online meetings, maybe for sales or discussions, but again, it's not a physical event where sellers gather to meet buyers. So B doesn't seem right.

Option C is Sales promotions. Sales promotions are activities like discounts, free samples, or contests to boost sales. They can happen in various places, but they don't specifically involve groups of sellers meeting together. So I don't think C is the answer.

Option D is Public relations activities. PR is about managing the company's image through media, press releases, etc. It's more about communication than sellers meeting together. So D is probably not it.

Option E is Press conference. That's when a company invites media to make announcements. It's a specific event, but it's not about multiple sellers gathering to attract buyers. So E isn't the right choice.

Option F is Mass media advertising. That's using TV, radio, internet ads to reach a large audience. It's about broadcasting messages, not sellers meeting together. So F doesn't fit.

Option G is Product launches. Launch events are when a new product is introduced to the market. Sometimes they might have multiple companies, but the primary purpose is to launch a product, not necessarily for multiple sellers to meet buyers collectively. So G might not be it.

Option H is Market research. That's gathering data about customers and markets. It doesn't involve sellers meeting; it's more about data collection. So H is out.

Option I is Exhibitions. Exhibitions, like trade shows or fairs, are events where multiple sellers gather to display their products to attract buyers. That sounds exactly like what the question is describing. So I is looking like a strong candidate.

Option J is Social media campaigns. Those are online marketing efforts through platforms like Facebook or Twitter. It's not about physical meetings of sellers, so J isn't the right answer.

Wait, let me think again. The key part of the question is "groups of sellers meet collectively with the key purpose of attracting buyers." So exhibitions fit because they're events where many sellers (exhibitors) come together to showcase their products to potential buyers. Yes, that makes sense.

So the correct answer should be I: Exhibitions.

The correct answer is I: Exhibitions. These events bring together multiple sellers to showcase their products and attract buyers.
