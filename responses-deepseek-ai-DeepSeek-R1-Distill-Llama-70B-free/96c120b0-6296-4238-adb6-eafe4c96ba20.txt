Okay, so I need to figure out which option is inadmissible to prove the insured's correct date of birth. The question is about evidence admissibility, probably under rules of evidence. Let me think about each option.

The issue is the insured's date of birth. The plaintiff is suing an insurance company, so the insurance company might be contesting the age, maybe regarding policy terms or payout amounts.

First, I remember that certain documents are considered self-authenticating or have exceptions to the hearsay rule. Birth certificates, for example, fall under public records and are admissible. So option F is a photocopy of the birth certificate—probably admissible.

Hospital birth records are also public records, so D should be admissible. Similarly, school records (I) are likely admissible as business records.

Driver's licenses (E) are official documents, so they should be okay. Social media posts (C) could be hearsay but might qualify under some exception, like a statement of personal knowledge if the insured posted it themselves. Or maybe it's nonhearsay if it's not being offered for the truth but just to show the person celebrated on that day. Hmm, not sure about that one yet.

Option A is a diary entry from the mother. Diaries are typically hearsay unless they fall under a hearsay exception, like present-sense impressions or personal knowledge. But wait, isn't there a specific rule about family history or personal records? Oh right, under FRE 803(5), a family history or personal record might be admissible if it's a record concerning the family made by a family member. So the mother's diary could be admissible as a family record exception.

Option B is a family bible with birth date inscribed. Family Bibles are a classic example. Under common law, entries in family Bibles were admissible as an exception to hearsay. But I think the Federal Rules may not automatically allow them anymore unless they qualify under another exception, like 803(5) or 803(6) as a business record. Wait, no, family Bibles are more under the family records exception. So I think they are still admissible.

Option G is a family portrait with ages engraved. That seems a bit odd. The engraved ages would be statements about their ages at the time of the portrait. But how would that help in proving the birth date? Unless it's a portrait from near the time of birth. But even then, the age would be current, not the birth date. Also, the engraved ages would be hearsay unless an exception applies. I'm not sure about this one. Maybe it's inadmissible because it's a statement offered to prove the birth date, and there's no exception that covers it. Alternatively, maybe it's nonhearsay because it's just a statement of ages at the time, but that might not directly prove the birth date.

Option H is a letter from a childhood friend recalling shared birthdays. That's hearsay because it's an out-of-court statement offered for the truth. The friend's memory might be based on personal knowledge, but unless it falls under an exception, it's inadmissible. I don't think there's an exception that would apply here. So H might be inadmissible.

Option J is a sworn affidavit from the brother. Affidavits are sworn statements, so they can be admissible if they're based on personal knowledge and not hearsay. Since the brother is verifying the birth date, it's likely admissible.

So now, looking back at the options, the question is which one is inadmissible. Let me go through each:

A: Diary entry—probably admissible under family records exception.
B: Family bible—admissible.
C: Social media post—maybe admissible as nonhearsay or under some exception, but I'm not certain. If it's the insured's own post, maybe it's an admission under FRE 801(d)(2). Since the insured is the declarant, and it's being offered against them, it's an opposing party's statement, which is nonhearsay. So C is admissible.
D: Hospital record—yes, public record.
E: Driver's license—yes, official record.
F: Birth certificate copy—yes.
G: Family portrait with engraved ages. This is tricky. The portrait itself is not hearsay, but the engraving is a statement. If it's offered for the truth of the ages, then it's hearsay. Unless it's a business record or falls under another exception. But I don't think so. So G would be hearsay and not covered by an exception. So G is inadmissible.
H: Letter from friend—this is hearsay, no exception, so inadmissible.
I: School record—business record, admissible.
J: Affidavit—admissible.

The question asks which is inadmissible. So both G and H might be inadmissible. But looking at the options, the question gives options A to J, and I need to pick one.

The question is about which is inadmissible. So if both G and H are inadmissible, but the options have to choose one.

Wait, but the diary entry (A) is made by the mother, a family member, so it's admissible under 803(5). The family bible (B) is also admissible under 803(5).

The social media post (C) is admissible as a party admission. The friend's letter (H) is hearsay without exception, so inadmissible. The portrait (G) is hearsay, but perhaps it's not being offered for the truth. Wait, the engraved ages could be considered factual statements, so they would be hearsay. Unless they're not. Alternatively, maybe the portrait is real evidence, but the engraving is still hearsay.

So the options that are inadmissible are G and H. But the question is which is one of them.

Wait, looking at the options again. The question asks which is inadmissible if offered to prove the insured's correct date of birth.

Option G is a family portrait with the ages engraved. So the engraving likely includes the insured's age at the time, but not the birth date. So even if it were admissible, it might not directly prove the birth date. But the question is about admissibility, not relevance. So assuming it's relevant, but is it admissible?

Alternatively, maybe the portrait's engraving is hearsay, so inadmissible. So G is inadmissible.

Option H is a letter from a friend recalling birthdays. That's hearsay, so inadmissible.

So the question has ten options, and the correct answer is either G or H.

Wait, let me think again. Are there any exceptions that apply to H? The friend's letter is an out-of-court statement, so hearsay. Unless it's a present-sense impression or excited utterance, but that's unlikely. So H is inadmissible.

So in the options, both G and H are inadmissible. Wait, but the options are A-J, so perhaps only one is correct.

Wait, looking back at the possible options. The answer choices are A to J, and the question states "which of the following is inadmissible".

Another angle: The social media post (C) might be self-authenticating under FRE 902(13) for electronic records, but maybe not. Or it could be hearsay. If it's the insured's own statement, it's an admission, so it's nonhearsay under 801(d)(2)(A). So C is admissible.

So among the options, H is a letter from a friend, hearsay, no exception—so inadmissible. G is a portrait with engraved ages, which is a statement, hearsay, no exception—so inadmissible.

But the question asks for one answer. So perhaps the intended answer is G or H.

Wait, perhaps the family portrait (G) doesn't qualify as a hearsay exception. The engraving is a statement of fact, so it's hearsay. Unless it's a business record, but a portrait isn't a business record. So G is inadmissible.

Option H is the friend's letter, which is hearsay and inadmissible.

So the question is which option is inadmissible. The correct answer is either G or H.

Wait, but the question is about which is "inadmissible if offered to prove the insured's correct date of birth."

The portrait's engraved ages don't directly state the birth date; they state the age at the time of the portrait. So even if the portrait was taken, say, in 1990, and the age is 5, you can calculate the birth year as 1985. But that's a bit indirect. But the main issue is whether it's admissible as evidence.

So the engraving is hearsay. Unless it's a business record, which it's not. So G is inadmissible.

Option H is also inadmissible, but perhaps it's more clearly inadmissible because it's a specific statement about the birth date.

Wait, but if H is a letter from a friend recalling shared birthdays, it's their memory. But without any exception, it's inadmissible.

So the question is which of these is inadmissible. The options are G and H.

Looking back, the options given are:

A: Diary entry—probably admissible.

B: Family bible—admissible.

C: Social media post—admissible as admission.

D: Hospital record—admissible.

E: Driver's license—admissible.

F: Birth certificate—admissible.

G: Family portrait with ages—maybe inadmissible.

H: Friend's letter—likely inadmissible.

I: School record—admissible.

J: Brother's affidavit—admissible.

So the question is which is inadmissible. So among the options, G and H are inadmissible.

But the options are A-J, so perhaps the answer is G or H.

Wait, the question is part of a multiple-choice with only one correct answer. So I must choose between G and H.

Another approach: Which option is more likely to be considered inadmissible?

The family portrait with engraved ages (G) might be considered for the limited purpose of the age at that time, but without the birth date, it's not directly relevant. However, the main issue is admissibility. The engraving is hearsay, so inadmissible.

The friend's letter (H) is also hearsay, so inadmissible.

So which one is the correct answer?

The question asks which is inadmissible. So both G and H are inadmissible, but perhaps only one is among the options.

Wait, the options are labeled A-J, so perhaps the answer is G.

Alternatively, perhaps G is not hearsay. Maybe the portrait is real evidence, and the engraving is a fact. But I don't think so; the engraving is a statement of fact, hence hearsay.

Wait, another thought: The portrait's engraving might be admissible as a business record if it's made in the regular course of business. But a family portrait isn't a business record. So G is hearsay and inadmissible.

Similarly, H is hearsay and inadmissible.

But in the options, only one is correct. So perhaps the intended answer is G, but I'm not entirely sure.

Alternatively, perhaps G is not being offered for the truth of the ages, but just to show that the family had a portrait. But no, the question states it's offered to prove the insured's birth date, so the engraved ages are for their truth.

I think both G and H are inadmissible, but since the options are single-choice, perhaps the intended answer is G.

Wait, but looking back, the family portrait (G) has the ages engraved, but if it's from the time when the insured was a child, say, the portrait was made when the insured was 10, that would mean birth year is current year minus 10. But to get the exact date, you might need more info. So it's not directly proving the birth date, but perhaps the year. But the question is about the correct date, so exactness might matter. However, the admissibility is about whether it can be used for that purpose.

Alternatively, perhaps the family portrait is irrelevant because it doesn't provide the exact date, but that's a different issue. The question is about admissibility, not relevance.

So I think both G and H are inadmissible. But perhaps in the context of the exam question, the answer is G.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think of another approach. Which of these options is not admissible.

Option F is a photocopy of the birth certificate. That's admissible under public records.

Option B is a family bible, which is admissible under hearsay exception for family records.

Option A is a diary entry from the mother, admissible as a family record.

Option C is a social media post, which is an admission by a party opponent, so nonhearsay.

Option D is a hospital record, public record.

Option E is driver's license, official record.

Option I is school record, business record.

Option J is an affidavit, which is admissible as a sworn statement.

So that leaves G and H as the possible inadmissible options.

Between G and H, which is more likely to be inadmissible.

The friend's letter (H) is clearly hearsay with no exception, so inadmissible.

The family portrait (G) is hearsay but perhaps might be considered nonhearsay if it's a statement of the photographer, but that's a stretch. Generally, it's hearsay.

So perhaps both are inadmissible, but the options have only one correct answer. Looking back at the question, the options are A-J, so the answer must be one of them.

Wait, perhaps G is not hearsay. The engraving on the portrait is not a statement being offered for its truth. Wait, no, the engraving is "with the ages of the family members," which implies it's stating their ages, which would be for the truth of that matter. So it's hearsay.

So I think the answer is G or H. But in the options, perhaps H is more clearly inadmissible.

Alternatively, perhaps the family portrait is admissible as a photograph under FRE 901, but the engraving is hearsay. So the image is real evidence, but the engraving's content is hearsay.

So the engraving is hearsay and inadmissible. Thus, G is inadmissible.

Alternatively, the portrait as a whole is admissible to show the family, but the engraved ages would be hearsay.

In that case, the answer would be G.

But I'm a bit torn. Another way: the friend's letter is more clearly hearsay and not subject to any exception. So H is inadmissible.

Wait, but in the options, the question is which is inadmissible. So perhaps the intended answer is G.

Alternatively, the correct answer is H.

Hmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to recall any specific rules.

Under FRE 803, the exceptions include:

- Present sense impressions (803(1))
- Excited utterances (803(2))
- Records of regularly conducted activity (803(6))
- Family records (803(5)): A record concerning the family made by a family member, which would include diary entries (A), family Bibles (B), and perhaps the portrait's engraving (G). But wait, the portrait is a physical object, not a record. So the engraving on the portrait may not fall under the family records exception because it's not a "record" but an engraving on an object. So maybe G is inadmissible.

In that case, G would be hearsay without an exception, making it inadmissible. Option H is also hearsay without exception, making it inadmissible.

But again, the question asks for one answer. So perhaps the intended answer is G, but I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, the answer is H.

Wait, another approach: The family portrait is a physical object. The engraving is part of the object, not a document. So under FRE 901, it's authenticated as a photograph, but the engraving's content is hearsay. So the engraving's content (the ages) would be hearsay unless an exception applies. Since it's not a document, it doesn't fall under family records or business records. So G is inadmissible.

The friend's letter (H) is a document, hearsay, no exception—so inadmissible.

So the answer could be either G or H, but the question expects one answer.

Wait, the question asks which is inadmissible. So perhaps both are, but in the options, only one is correct.

Looking back, the options are:

G: A family portrait engraved with the ages.

H: A letter from the insured's childhood friend recalling shared birthdays.

So the answer is either G or H.

But I think the friend's letter is more clearly inadmissible because it's a statement from someone else without any exception, whereas the portrait's engraving might have a weaker argument for admissibility, but it's still hearsay.

Wait, but the friend's letter is more directly about the birth date, while the portrait is about ages. So perhaps the portrait is less relevant, but the question is about admissibility, not relevance.

I think I'm overcomplicating this. The answer is likely G or H.

Wait, perhaps the friend's letter is inadmissible, so the answer is H.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: Which of these is not admissible under any exception.

The friend's letter (H) is hearsay and doesn't fall under any exception. The portrait's engraving (G) is hearsay, but perhaps under the family records exception, it's admissible. Wait, no, because the portrait isn't a "record" made by a family member; it's an engraving on a photo. So G is inadmissible.

So the answer is G.

Wait, but the family portrait was created by someone, perhaps a family member. If the engraving was done by a family member, then perhaps it's a family record under 803(5). So G could be admissible.

But I'm not sure. The family portrait is a physical object, not a document. So the engraving might not qualify as a "record" under 803(5). Therefore, G is inadmissible.

So I think the answer is G.
</think>

To determine which option is inadmissible if offered to prove the insured's correct date of birth, we must analyze each option under the rules of evidence, particularly focusing on hearsay and its exceptions.

### Analysis of Each Option:

1. **Option A: A diary entry from the insured's mother noting the day of the insured's birth.**  
   Diary entries fall under the hearsay exception for family records (FRE 803(5)) if they concern family history and are made by a family member. This is admissible.

2. **Option B: A family bible with the insured's birth date inscribed on the cover.**  
   Family Bibles are a classic example of records admissible under the family records exception (FRE 803(5)). This is admissible.

3. **Option C: A social
