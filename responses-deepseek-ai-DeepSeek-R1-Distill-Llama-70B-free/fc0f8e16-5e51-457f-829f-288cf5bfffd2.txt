Question:

What is the principle of diminishing marginal returns?

Options:

A: A rule that describes how, after a certain level of performance, additional input does not yield any output
B: A point beyond which the output attributable to each additional unit of factor input will become less and less.
C: An economic principle that suggests a constant decrease in output with each additional input
D: An economic theory that predicts unlimited growth
E: The phenomenon where output increases exponentially with each additional input
F: The principle stating that output increases linearly with input
G: The idea that each unit of input improves the quality of output, regardless of how much is already being produced
H: The concept that each additional input doubles the output
I: The belief that each additional unit of input decreases the total cost of production
J: A process where increasing amounts of input lead to proportional increases in output

Okay, so I have this question about the principle of diminishing marginal returns, and I need to pick the right answer from options A to J. Hmm, I remember that this concept is related to economics, specifically production and how inputs affect outputs. Let me think about what I learned.

Diminishing marginal returns, if I recall correctly, is about what happens when you add more of a variable input, like labor, to a fixed input, like capital or machinery. At first, adding more workers might increase output, but after a certain point, each additional worker adds less to the total output. So, the marginal return, which is the additional output per additional unit of input, starts to decrease.

Wait, but how does that translate into the options here? Let me look at each option one by one.

Option A says it's a rule where after a certain performance level, additional input doesn't yield output. That sounds a bit like diminishing returns, but I'm not sure. It says no output, which might be too extreme. I think in reality, the output per input just decreases, not that it stops entirely.

Option B mentions a point beyond which each additional unit of factor input leads to less and less output. That sounds more accurate. It's about the output per unit of input decreasing beyond a certain point. So B could be the right choice.

Option C says it's a constant decrease in output with each additional input. That doesn't sound right because diminishing marginal returns is about the marginal output (the extra output) decreasing, not the total output necessarily. Also, it might not be a constant decrease, just a trend towards lower increases.

Option D is about unlimited growth, which is the opposite of diminishing returns. So D is probably wrong.

Option E suggests output increases exponentially. That's more like increasing returns, so E is incorrect.

Option F talks about linear increases in output with input. That's the standard proportionality, not the diminishing part. So F is not right.

Option G is about input improving quality, not quantity. Diminishing returns is about quantity of output, so G is off-topic.

Option H says each input doubles output. That's way off because doubling would mean increasing returns, not diminishing.

Option I mentions decreasing total cost with more input. That's more about economies of scale, not the same as diminishing returns. So I is probably not it.

Option J states that increasing inputs lead to proportional increases. That sounds like a linear relationship again, so J is incorrect.

So putting it all together, the correct answer should be option B. It correctly describes that beyond a certain point, each additional unit of input results in less additional output. The key here is that the marginal returns (the extra output per unit input) diminish after a certain level.

The principle of diminishing marginal returns is an economic concept that describes how, after a certain point, each additional unit of input results in a smaller increase in output. This means the marginal output per unit of input decreases beyond that point.

- **Option A**: Incorrect. It suggests that additional input yields no output, which is too extreme.
- **Option B**: Correct. It accurately describes the point beyond which additional inputs lead to less and less output.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. It implies a constant decrease in total output, which is not the case.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. It refers to unlimited growth, the opposite of diminishing returns.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. It describes exponential output increases, not diminishing returns.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. It refers to linear output increases, not diminishing returns.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. It focuses on quality, not quantity of output.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. It suggests output doubles with each input, indicating increasing returns.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. It refers to decreasing total costs, not output.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. It describes proportional output increases, not diminishing returns.

The correct answer is **B**.

B
