Question:

A permanent resident alien applied for a position as a state trooper. A state trooper is a member of the state police force, a law enforcement body that exercises broad police authority throughout the state. The position of state trooper is filled on the basis of competitive examinations taken by all of the applicants. After the resident alien applied for the position, the state authorities refused him permission to take the qualifying examination. The state authorities based their refusal on state statute, which provided:"No person shall become a member of the state police unless he/she shall be a citizen of the United States. "Thus, under this provision, as a prerequisite to becoming a member of the state police, an alien must relinquish his foreign citizenship and become a citizen. In an opinion upholding the validity of the statute, the State Attorney General noted that since police officers fall within the category of important non-elective officials who participate directly in the execution of broad public policy, only citizens of the United States should be qualified to apply for such positions. "At the time the resident alien applied for a position as a state trooper, he was a citizen of a foreign country and not currently eligible for citizenship. As a result of a federal statute, Congress has imposed a five-year residency requirement for the attainment of citizenship. Under this federal law, an alien must reside in this country for a period of five years as a prerequisite before applying for citizenship. At this time, the resident alien had only lawfully been residing in the United States for two years, and thus would not be eligible to apply for naturalization until three years later. If the resident alien brings suit in federal court challenging the constitutionality of the state statute limiting the membership of its state police force to citizens of the United States, the court will most likely declare the statute

Options:

A: constitutional, because citizenship bears a rational relationship to the special demands of the police function.
B: unconstitutional, because it constitutes a violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
C: constitutional, as it falls under the state's right to regulate its own law enforcement bodies.
D: unconstitutional, as it infringes on the resident alien's right to seek employment.
E: unconstitutional, because it constitutes a violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.
F: constitutional, because the resident alien does not yet meet the federal requirements for citizenship.
G: unconstitutional, because it is an unfair restriction on the resident alien's opportunity for employment.
H: constitutional, because the statute is within the state's plenary power to regulate the health, safety, and welfare of its citizens.
I: unconstitutional, because it violates the resident alien's rights under the Fifth Amendment.
J: constitutional, because the statute does not specifically discriminate against any particular nationality or ethnicity.

Okay, so I've got this question about constitutional law, specifically dealing with citizenship requirements for state troopers. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The scenario is that a permanent resident alien applied to be a state trooper, but was denied the chance to take the qualifying exam because of a state statute. The statute says you have to be a U.S. citizen to join the state police. The State Attorney General defended this by saying police officers are important officials involved in executing public policy, so only citizens should qualify.

Now, the alien is suing in federal court, claiming the statute is unconstitutional. I need to figure out whether the court would find the statute constitutional or not.

First, I remember that the Supreme Court has dealt with cases where states require citizenship for certain public jobs. I think the key here is the balance between the state's interest and the individual's rights, particularly under the Equal Protection Clause.

In the past, the Court has held that requiring citizenship for certain government positions is constitutional if it's rationally related to the duties of the job. For example, in Foley v. Connelie (1977), the Court upheld a New York law requiring police officers to be citizens. The reasoning was that law enforcement officers have a role in enforcing the laws and maintaining public order, which are functions closely tied to citizenship.

But wait, there's also the case of Bernal v. Fainter (1984), where the Court struck down a Texas law requiring notaries public to be citizens. The Court said that the state didn't show a significant state interest that could not be served by hiring non-citizens. So it's not a blanket ruleâ€”each case depends on the specific duties of the position.

In this question, state troopers are part of the state police force with broad authority. That sounds similar to the role in Foley. So the state's argument that police officers are involved in executing broad public policy seems relevant.

The statute in question requires citizenship as a prerequisite, and the resident alien can't apply for citizenship yet due to federal residency requirements. But the issue isn't about his eligibility for citizenship; it's about the state's right to require it for the job.

I think the court would analyze this under the Equal Protection Clause. The resident alien is a lawful permanent resident, so he's a person within the state's jurisdiction. Equal Protection applies to aliens in many contexts, but states can sometimes treat citizens and non-citizens differently if there's a rational basis.

The state's argument is that police officers are important officials who execute public policy, so only citizens should hold those positions. The Attorney General's opinion aligns with that reasoning.

In Foley, the Court found that citizenship was a legitimate requirement for police because their role involves a high level of responsibility in enforcing laws and maintaining order. So applying that same logic here, the state statute would likely be upheld.

Looking at the options:

A: Constitutional, rational relationship. This seems to align with Foley's reasoning.

B: Unconstitutional under Equal Protection. But I think the state's rationale would satisfy rational basis.

C: Constitutional, state's right. While states do have authority, the issue is whether the requirement is constitutional, not just state's rights.

D: Unconstitutional, infringes on employment. But the Court allows some restrictions based on citizenship.

E: Due process violation. I don't think due process is the main issue here; it's more Equal Protection.

F: Constitutional, because alien isn't yet a citizen. But the issue is the state requiring citizenship, not the federal naturalization process.

G: Unconstitutional, unfair restriction. Again, the Court has allowed such restrictions in certain jobs.

H: Constitutional, state's plenary power. While states have police powers, the question is about the specific citizenship requirement.

I: Fifth Amendment violation. The Fifth doesn't apply here as much as the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection.

J: Constitutional, no specific discrimination. That's true, but the issue is whether the classification is permissible.

So I think the correct answer is A: constitutional because citizenship bears a rational relationship to the police function. This aligns with the reasoning in Foley v. Connelie.

The question revolves around whether a state statute requiring U.S. citizenship as a prerequisite for becoming a state trooper is constitutional. The resident alien was denied the opportunity to take the qualifying examination based on this statute, and the state defended the requirement by emphasizing the critical role of police officers in executing public policy.

The analysis hinges on the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and relevant Supreme Court precedents. In *Foley v. Connelie (1977)*, the Court upheld a New York law requiring police officers to be citizens, reasoning that the role of law enforcement officers in maintaining public order and enforcing laws justifies such a requirement. This decision suggests that citizenship requirements for certain government positions are constitutional if they are rationally related to the duties of the job.

In contrast, *Bernal v. Fainter (1984)* struck down a Texas law requiring notaries public to be citizens, as the state failed to demonstrate a significant interest that could not be served by non-citizens. However, the role of state troopers, with their broad police authority, aligns more closely with the rationale in *Foley*.

The state's argument that police officers are important officials executing public policy supports the constitutionality of the statute. The court would likely find that the requirement bears a rational relationship to the special demands of the police function, consistent with *Foley*. While the resident alien's inability to apply for citizenship due to federal residency requirements is noted, the issue is not about eligibility for citizenship but the state's right to impose the requirement for the position.

Analyzing the options:

- **A** is correct because the statute is constitutional under the reasoning that citizenship is rationally related to the duties of state troopers.
- **B** is incorrect because the statute does not violate the Equal Protection Clause; the state's rationale satisfies the rational basis test.
- **C**, while true about state authority, does not directly address the constitutionality of the citizenship requirement.
- **D**, **E**, **G**, and **I** are incorrect because the statute does not infringe on employment rights, due process, or Fifth Amendment rights in this context.
- **F** is irrelevant because the issue is the state's requirement, not the federal naturalization process.
- **H** and **J** are less precise, as the key issue is the rational relationship between citizenship and the police function.

Thus, the court would most likely declare the statute constitutional.
