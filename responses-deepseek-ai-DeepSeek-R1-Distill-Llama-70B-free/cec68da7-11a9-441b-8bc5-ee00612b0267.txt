Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the order of growth of a function T(n). The definition is given as T(1) = 7, and for n ≥ 1, T(n+1) = 3n + T(n). Hmm, I think this is a recurrence relation, and I remember that these often require some kind of expansion or pattern finding to solve.

Let me start by writing out the first few terms to see if I can spot a pattern. 

T(1) is given as 7.

T(2) = 3*1 + T(1) = 3 +7 = 10.

T(3) = 3*2 + T(2) = 6 +10 =16.

T(4) = 3*3 + T(3) =9+16=25.

T(5)=3*4 +25=12+25=37.

Wait, let's see the numbers: 7, 10,16,25,37... I'm trying to see if this looks familiar. It seems each term is increasing by 3*(n-1), right? Because each step adds 3 times (n-1) to the previous T(n).

But maybe I should represent T(n) in terms of a sum. Since it's a recursive function where each step adds 3k for k from 1 to n-1. Let me think about how to express T(n).

So T(n) = T(n-1) + 3*(n-1). And since T(1)=7, this is like a sum starting from 1 up to n-1 of 3k, plus the initial 7.

So T(n) = 7 + sum_{k=1 to n-1} 3k.

Wait, wait. Wait, when n=2, the sum is 3*1=3 → 7+3=10, which matches T(2)=10. For n=3, sum is 3*(1+2)=9 → 7+9=16, yes, that's correct. So yes, T(n) =7 + 3 * sum_{k=1 to n-1} k.

The sum from k=1 to m of k is m(m+1)/2. So substituting m = n-1, sum = (n-1)n/2.

So T(n) =7 +3*(n-1)n/2.

Simplify that: 3*(n^2 -n)/2 +7 = (3n² -3n)/2 +7.

Combine terms: (3n² -3n +14)/2.

Wait, let me check my algebra. 3*(n-1)*n/2 is (3n(n-1))/2. So yes, 3n² -3n over 2. Then adding 7, which is 14/2, gives (3n² -3n +14)/2.

Now, to find the order of growth, I can ignore constants and lower-order terms. So the dominant term is (3n²)/2, which is Θ(n²). 

Wait, but looking at the options, J is Θ(n²), but let me double-check. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the sum.

Wait, the initial condition is T(1)=7. Let me reindex the sum correctly. Because T(n) is built from T(1) plus the sum of 3k for k from 1 to n-1. So yes, that's correct.

So the expression I derived is T(n) = (3n² -3n +14)/2. The dominant term as n grows is 3n²/2, so T(n) is proportional to n squared. So the growth is Θ(n²), which is option J.

But wait, perhaps the problem is more complex. Let me think again. Another approach is to solve the recurrence relation using standard techniques. The recurrence is T(n+1) = T(n) + 3n. This is a linear recurrence, and we can express it as T(n) - T(n-1) = 3(n-1). 

The homogeneous solution is when the difference is zero, which is a constant. But since the nonhomogeneous term is 3n, which is linear, perhaps the particular solution is quadratic. Let me assume T(n) = an² + bn + c.

Then T(n+1) = a(n+1)^2 + b(n+1)+c = a(n² +2n +1) + bn +b +c= a n² + (2a + b) n + (a + b + c).

The recurrence is T(n+1) - T(n) =3n.

Calculating LHS: [a n² + (2a + b)n + (a + b + c)] - [a(n-1)^2 + b(n-1) +c] 

Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, the difference T(n) - T(n-1) = 3(n-1). Let me write that.

T(n) = a n² + bn + c.

T(n-1) = a(n-1)^2 + b(n-1) +c = a(n² -2n +1) + bn -b +c = a n² + (-2a +b) n + (a -b +c).

So T(n) - T(n-1) = [a n² + bn + c] - [a n² + (-2a +b) n + (a -b +c)].

Simplify:

= (a n² -a n²) + [bn - (-2a +b)n ] + [c - (a -b +c)].

= 0 + [bn +2a n -b n ] + [c -a +b -c].

= (2a n) + (-a + b).

According to the recurrence, T(n) - T(n-1) =3(n-1) =3n -3.

So:

2a n + (-a + b) =3n -3.

Equate coefficients:

2a=3 → a=3/2.

And -a +b = -3 → substituting a=3/2: -3/2 +b =-3 → b= -3 +3/2 = -3/2.

What about c? It's not determined by these equations because the difference T(n) - T(n-1) doesn't involve c. So c can be any constant, but it's determined by the initial condition.

So the general solution is T(n) = (3/2)n² - (3/2) n +c.

Now apply initial condition T(1)=7.

T(1)= (3/2)(1) - (3/2)(1) +c = 0 +c =7 → c=7.

So T(n)= (3/2)n² - (3/2)n +7.

Which can be written as (3n² -3n +14)/2, which matches what I had earlier.

So as n grows, the dominant term is (3/2)n². So T(n) is Θ(n²), which is option J.

To determine the order of growth of \( T(n) \), we start with the given recurrence relation:

\[
T(1) = 7, \quad T(n+1) = T(n) + 3n \quad \text{for } n \geq 1.
\]

### Step 1: Expand the recurrence
The recurrence can be expanded as:

\[
T(n) = T(n-1) + 3(n-1).
\]

Starting from \( T(1) = 7 \), we can write:

\[
T(n) = 7 + \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} 3k.
\]

### Step 2: Simplify the sum
The sum of the first \( m \) integers is \( \sum_{k=1}^m k = \frac{m(m+1)}{2} \). Substituting \( m = n-1 \), we get:

\[
\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} k = \frac{(n-1)n}{2}.
\]

Thus:

\[
T(n) = 7 + 3 \cdot \frac{(n-1)n}{2} = 7 + \frac{3n^2 - 3n}{2}.
\]

### Step 3: Combine terms
Combining terms gives:

\[
T(n) = \frac{3n^2 - 3n + 14}{2}.
\]

### Step 4: Analyze the order of growth
To determine the order of growth, we focus on the dominant term as \( n \to \infty \). The dominant term in \( T(n) \) is \( \frac{3n^2}{2} \), which grows proportionally to \( n^2 \). Therefore, \( T(n) \) is \( \Theta(n^2) \).

### Step 5: Verify with the recurrence relation
The recurrence relation \( T(n+1) = T(n) + 3n \) is linear, and solving it confirms that \( T(n) \) grows quadratically. The derived expression \( T(n) = \frac{3n^2 - 3n + 14}{2} \) matches this behavior.

### Final Answer
The order of growth of \( T(n) \) is \( \Theta(n^2) \), which corresponds to **option J**.
