Okay, so I have this genetics question in front of me, and I need to figure out which condition shows anticipation in paternal transmission. Hmm, I remember that anticipation has something to do with the symptoms getting worse or appearing earlier as the disorder is passed to the next generation. Oh right, it's often linked to trinucleotide repeat disorders. 

The question is specifically about paternal transmission, so I think the effect might be more pronounced when the father passes it on. Let me look at the options one by one.

Option A is Cystic Fibrosis. I think that's an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. I don't recall it being associated with anticipation. So probably not A.

Option B: Alzheimer's. There are different types, some familial. I remember that the early-onset form can be autosomal dominant, but I don't think it's typically associated with anticipation. More about age-related onset. So B might not be the answer.

Option C: Huntington's disease. Oh yeah, Huntington's is a classic example of anticipation. It's caused by an expansion of CAG repeats in the Huntingtin gene. And I think paternal transmission is more commonly associated with larger expansions, leading to earlier onset in children. So this could be the answer.

Option D: Parkinson's. Most cases are sporadic, but some have genetic components. I don't think it's known for anticipation. More about late-onset and various genetic factors. So probably not D.

Option E: Sickle Cell Anemia. That's an autosomal recessive blood disorder. No relation to anticipation. So E is out.

Option F: Fragile X syndrome. This is another trinucleotide repeat disorder, specifically CGG repeats in the FMR1 gene. It's an X-linked condition. I think anticipation can occur, especially when the permutation carrier (like a mother with a premutation) passes it on. But wait, the question is about paternal transmission. Do fathers pass it on with anticipation? Hmm, I'm a bit fuzzy here. Because Fragile X is on the X, fathers can only pass the Y to sons, so daughters get the X from dad. So if a father has the full mutation, his daughters will definitely get it. But if he has a premutation, his daughter might get a larger expansion. But I'm not sure if paternal transmission is the main case of anticipation here or if it's more about the maternal side. I'll have to think more about this.

Option G: Marfan syndrome. Autosomal dominant, caused by FBN1 mutations. It doesn't have anticipation as a feature. So G is unlikely.

Option H: Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. X-linked recessive. It's about dystrophin mutations. No anticipation here. So H is out.

Option I: Down syndrome. It's a chromosomal abnormality (trisomy 21), not related to anticipation. So I's not it.

Option J: Hemophilia A. X-linked recessive. No anticipation involved. So J is out.

So I'm down to C and F. I know Huntington's shows anticipation, especially paternal. In Huntington's, the expanded CAG repeat tends to get longer when passed from the father, leading to earlier symptoms in the next generation. For Fragile X, I think anticipation is more about the premutation carriers, usually mothers, where the risk of expansion increases as the mother's own cells vary. But for fathers, if they have the full mutation, they can only pass it to daughters, and in the case of Fragile X, sons would get the Y, so they wouldn't get it. So maybe anticipation in paternal transmission is more significant in Huntington's.

Wait, another point. In Fragile X, the premutation can expand when passed maternally. So when a mother with a premutation has children, each child has a higher risk of the full mutation. But since fathers can't pass the X to their sons, the anticipation might not be as prominent in paternal transmission. So perhaps Huntington's is the better answer here.

So the correct answer is C: Huntington disease.

Anticipation refers to the phenomenon where symptoms of a genetic disorder become more severe or appear earlier as it is passed to subsequent generations. This is often observed in trinucleotide repeat disorders. The question focuses on anticipation in paternal transmission, so the analysis of each option is as follows:

- **A: Cystic Fibrosis**  
  This is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. It is not associated with anticipation.  

- **B: Alzheimer's Disease**  
  While there are familial forms of Alzheimer's, it is primarily age-related and not typically linked to anticipation.  

- **C: Huntington Disease**  
  Huntington's is a classic example of anticipation. It is caused by an expansion of CAG repeats in the Huntingtin gene. Paternal transmission is particularly associated with larger expansions, leading to earlier onset in offspring. This makes it a strong candidate.  

- **D: Parkinson's Disease**  
  Most cases are sporadic, and while there are genetic components, it is not known for anticipation.  

- **E: Sickle Cell Anemia**  
  An autosomal recessive blood disorder with no relation to anticipation.  

- **F: Fragile X Syndrome**  
  This is an X-linked trinucleotide repeat disorder (CGG repeats in the FMR1 gene). While anticipation can occur, it is more commonly associated with maternal transmission, where premutation carriers may pass on expanded alleles. Paternal transmission is less likely to show anticipation.  

- **G: Marfan Syndrome**  
  An autosomal dominant disorder caused by FBN1 mutations. It does not feature anticipation.  

- **H: Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy**  
  An X-linked recessive disorder caused by dystrophin mutations. No anticipation is involved.  

- **I: Down Syndrome**  
  A chromosomal abnormality (trisomy 21) unrelated to anticipation.  

- **J: Hemophilia A**  
  An X-linked recessive disorder with no association with anticipation.  

Based on this analysis, **Huntington Disease (C)** is the correct answer, as it is a well-documented example of anticipation, particularly in paternal transmission.
