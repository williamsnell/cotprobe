Question:

A man died in 1985. His will devised his estate in a Midwestern state to his son and daughter "to share and share alike as tenants in common. "At the time of their father's death, the daughter lived in a different part of the Midwestern state (in which the estate was located) while the son resided in a state in the Southwest. After the funeral, the daughter returned to her own residence, but the son decided to occupy the estate. He put his name on the mailbox and has paid the taxes and maintenance expenses. The daughter has been generally aware of this, but because she cared little about the estate, the daughter has never pressed her brother about the property. Since 1985, the daughter has not paid any rent or other compensation to her brother, nor has he requested such payment. In January 2010, a series of disputes arose between the son and daughter for the first time concerning their respective rights to the estate. The state in which the property is located recognizes the usual common law types of cotenancies and there is no applicable legislation on the subject. Now, the son claims the entire fee simple absolute title to the estate and brings an action against his sister to quiet title in himself. If the Midwestern states in which the property is located has an ordinary 20-year adverse possession statute, judgment should be for whom?

Options:

A: The son, because he has paid the taxes and maintenance expenses since 1985.
B: The son, because the acts of the parties indicate the sister's intention to renounce her ownership rights to the estate.
C: The daughter, because there is no evidence that her brother has performed sufficient acts to constitute an ouster.
D: The daughter, because the brother did not take any legal action to claim the property until 2010.
E: Both, because they were given the estate "to share and share alike as tenants in common."
F: The son, because during the past 25 years, the son has exercised the type of occupancy ordinarily considered sufficient to satisfy adverse possession requirements.
G: The daughter, because the brother did not request any rent or other compensation for the past 25 years.
H: The son, because the daughter has not shown any interest in the property.
I: The daughter, because one cotenant cannot acquire title by adverse possession against another.
J: The son, because he has lived in the property for more than 20 years.

Okay, so I have this legal question about property law, specifically dealing with tenancy in common and adverse possession. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the facts: A man died in 1985, and his will left his estate to his son and daughter as tenants in common. That means they each own an undivided half-interest in the property. At the time, the daughter lived in a different part of the same Midwestern state, while the son was in the Southwest. After the funeral, the daughter went back to her place, but the son decided to live on the estate. He put his name on the mailbox, paid taxes, and handled maintenance. The daughter knew about this but didn't care much, so she never asked for rent or anything. Neither did the son ask her for any compensation. Now, in 2010, they had a dispute, and the son is claiming the entire fee simple title, suing to quiet title.

The question is about who wins. The state has a 20-year adverse possession statute and follows common law cotenancies.

So, the key issues here are tenancy in common and whether adverse possession applies between cotenants.

I remember that tenants in common each own a share, and unless there's an ouster, one tenant can't claim adverse possession against another. An ouster is when one tenant excludes the others in a way that's clear and hostile. Without an ouster, the possession is considered permissive, and the other tenant's interest isn't affected.

In this case, the son lived there, paid taxes, etc., but the daughter never objected. However, she was aware but didn't press the issue. Did the son's actions amount to an ouster? I think an ouster requires some clear act showing the intent to exclude the other tenant. Just living there and paying the expenses might not be enough unless he actively prevented her from using the property or claimed it as his own.

Wait, the son put his name on the mailbox. That might be a sign, but without more, like telling her she can't come there or refusing her entry, it's not necessarily an ouster. Also, the daughter didn't pay rent, but that doesn't mean she abandoned her interest; she just didn't enforce it.

So, under common law, a cotenant can't acquire title through adverse possession unless there's an ouster. Since there's no evidence the son excluded her or that she abandoned her share, adverse possession doesn't apply here.

Looking at the answer choices, option I says that one cotenant can't acquire title by adverse possession against another. That seems correct. Option C mentions no ouster, which is also relevant because without ouster, possession isn't adverse. But option I is more directly on point about cotenants and adverse possession.

Options F and J talk about the time period. The son has been there over 20 years, which meets the statutory period, but if ouster isn't established, the time doesn't matter. So those options are incorrect.

Options A and B are about paying taxes or renouncing rights. Paying expenses doesn't transfer ownership, and the daughter's inaction doesn't mean she renounced her rights. So those are out.

Options D and G talk about the daughter's actions or lack thereof. D says because the brother didn't act until 2010, but that's not relevant. G says because no rent was paid, but as cotenants, rent isn't required unless they agree to it.

E is about both having the estate, but the son is claiming the entire title, so that's not right.

H says the daughter didn't show interest, but she's a cotenant and doesn't need to. Unless ousted, her interest remains.

So the correct answer should be I: The daughter, because one cotenant cannot acquire title by adverse possession against another.
</think>

The correct answer is based on the principle that in a tenancy in common, one cotenant cannot acquire title by adverse possession against another unless there is a clear ouster. Here, the son's actions, such as living on the property and paying expenses, do not constitute an ouster without evidence of excluding the daughter or her abandoning her interest. Therefore, the daughter retains her share.
