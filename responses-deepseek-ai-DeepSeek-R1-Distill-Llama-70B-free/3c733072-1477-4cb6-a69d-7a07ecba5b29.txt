Question:

Which statement about the beak size of finches on the island of Daphne Major during prolonged drought is true?

Options:

A: Each bird's beak size increased due to the abundance of food during the drought.
B: Each bird developed a deeper, stronger beak as the drought persisted.
C: Each bird's beak became weaker and narrower as the drought persisted.
D: Each bird evolved a deeper, stronger beak as the drought persisted.
E: Each bird's survival was not influenced by the depth and strength of its beak during the drought.
F: Each bird that survived the drought produced only offspring with deeper, stronger beaks than seen in the previous generation.
G: Each bird's beak size did not change during the drought.
H: Each bird's survival was strongly influenced by the depth and strength of its beak as the drought persisted.
I: Each bird's survival was only influenced by its ability to find water during the drought, not the size of its beak.
J: Each bird that survived the drought produced offspring with the same beak size as seen in the previous generation.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about finches on Daphne Major, and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. Let's think through this.

I remember learning about the Galapagos finches and how their beak sizes changed, especially during times when the environment was tough, like a drought. So the question is specifically about what happens to their beak size during a prolonged drought.

The options are A through J. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A says each bird's beak increased because of abundant food. Wait, during a drought, I don't think there's abundant food. Droughts usually mean less food, so that doesn't make sense. Plus, beak size increasing in each bird individually? I thought beak size changes are due to natural selection over generations, not each bird changing.

Option B: Each bird developed a deeper, stronger beak as the drought went on. Hmm, does each bird physically change their beak? I don't think so. I recall that the changes are evolutionary, so it's the population that changes over time, not individual birds. So B might not be right.

Option C: Beaks became weaker and narrower. That seems opposite of what I remember. During droughts, plants with tougher seeds are more common, so birds with stronger beaks can crack them. So weaker beaks would be a disadvantage, so C is probably not correct.

Option D: Each bird evolved a deeper beak. No, evolution doesn't happen to each bird. It's the population as a whole that evolves. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Survival wasn't influenced by beak depth and strength. No, I think the opposite is true. The beak's characteristics are crucial for survival during droughts because the available food changes. So E is wrong.

Option F: Survivors produce only offspring with deeper beaks. Well, natural selection leads to more of the advantageous traits in the next generation, but it's not that each survivor only has deeper-beaked offspring. There's variation, but selection makes those traits more common. So F might not be the best choice.

Option G: Beak size didn't change. No, that contradicts what I know. The drought affects selection pressures, so beak size should change in the population.

Option H: Survival was strongly influenced by beak depth and strength. Yes, this rings a bell. Birds with beaks better suited to the available food (like tougher seeds) during drought were more likely to survive. So H sounds correct.

Option I: Survival only influenced by finding water, not beak size. That doesn't seem right. Water is important, but access to food is also crucial, and the beak's role in eating is key. So I is probably incorrect.

Option J: Survivors' offspring have the same beak size. No, because natural selection would lead to the next generation having more of the advantageous traits, so J is wrong.

Putting it all together, the correct answer should be H. Because during drought, the survival of each bird was indeed influenced by their beak's depth and strength. The birds with stronger, deeper beaks could eat the tougher seeds that were available, increasing their chances of survival.

The correct answer is H. During a prolonged drought on Daphne Major, the survival of finches was strongly influenced by the depth and strength of their beaks. Birds with deeper, stronger beaks were better adapted to the tougher seeds that became the primary food source during the drought, giving them a survival advantage. This aligns with the evolutionary mechanism of natural selection, where environmental pressures favor specific traits in a population over time.

Answer: H
