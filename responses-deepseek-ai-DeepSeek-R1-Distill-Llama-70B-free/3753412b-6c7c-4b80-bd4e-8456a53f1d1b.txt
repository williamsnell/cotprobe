Okay, so I've got this question here about a corporation's income before taxes. Let me see if I can figure this out. The question says that ABC Corporation had a net income of $1,000,000 in 1976, and they pay 50% taxes. I need to find out what their income was before taxes.

Hmm, I remember that net income is the profit after all expenses, including taxes, have been deducted. So if a company makes money before taxes, then they pay taxes on that, and what's left is the net income. So the formula should be something like Net Income = Income Before Taxes - Taxes.

Wait, but taxes are calculated on the income before taxes, right? So it's more accurate to say that Net Income = Income Before Taxes * (1 - tax rate). Oh right, because the tax is a percentage of the pre-tax income.

So in this case, the tax rate is 50%, which is 0.5. The net income is $1,000,000. So I can rearrange the formula to find the pre-tax income. Let's see, if Net Income = PreTax * (1 - tax rate), then PreTax = Net Income / (1 - tax rate).

Plugging in the numbers: PreTax = 1,000,000 / (1 - 0.5). 1 - 0.5 is 0.5. So 1,000,000 divided by 0.5 is 2,000,000. Oh wait, so the income before taxes would be $2 million.

Looking at the options, option C is $2,000,000. That should be the correct answer.

Wait a second, just to double-check. If the pre-tax income is $2 million, and the tax rate is 50%, then taxes would be $1 million. Subtracting that from $2 million gives $1 million net income, which matches the question. Yep, that makes sense.

To determine ABC Corporation's income before taxes, we use the relationship between net income and pre-tax income. The formula is:

\[
\text{Net Income} = \text{Income Before Taxes} \times (1 - \text{tax rate})
\]

Given that the net income is $1,000,000 and the tax rate is 50% (or 0.5), we rearrange the formula to solve for the pre-tax income:

\[
\text{Income Before Taxes} = \frac{\text{Net Income}}{1 - \text{tax rate}} = \frac{1,000,000}{1 - 0.5} = \frac{1,000,000}{0.5} = 2,000,000
\]

Thus, the income before taxes is $2,000,000. Verifying, if the pre-tax income is $2,000,000 and the tax rate is 50%, the taxes would be $1,000,000, leaving a net income of $1,000,000, which matches the question.

The correct answer is:

**C: $2,000,000**
