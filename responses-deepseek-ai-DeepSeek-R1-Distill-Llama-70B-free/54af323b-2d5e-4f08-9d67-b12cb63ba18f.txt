Okay, so I have this question about reaction time differences between younger and older adults. The question is asking, what happens when older adults do a certain activityâ€”specifically, what reduces the reaction time difference. The options are A through F, and I need to pick the correct one.

Hmm, reaction time generally slows down as people age. I remember that physical exercise, especially aerobic, can have various benefits for the brain. Aerobic exercise gets the heart rate up, which increases blood flow to the brain. That might help maintain or improve cognitive functions, including reaction time.

Let me think about each option. Option A is regular aerobic exercise. That sounds plausible because I've heard that exercise is good for the brain. It promotes neurogenesis and improves executive functions. So maybe this would help older adults have faster reaction times, closing the gap with younger people.

Option B is lifting weights regularly. Weight training is good for muscle strength and overall health, but does it specifically help with reaction time? I'm not too sure. Maybe it's more about physical strength than cognitive speed.

Option C is reading every day. Reading is mentally stimulating, which can help keep the mind sharp. But does it directly impact reaction time? I'm not certain. It might help with cognitive functions like memory and understanding, but reaction time is more about speed and neural processing.

Option D is consuming large quantities of vitamins. Vitamins are important for overall health, but taking a lot of them doesn't necessarily target reaction time. Unless someone is deficient, but the question doesn't specify that. Plus, excessive vitamins can sometimes be harmful.

Option E is a high protein diet. Protein is essential for the body, but again, does it directly affect reaction time? I know that the brain uses glucose as fuel, but protein's role in quick neural responses isn't clear to me. Maybe it's more about muscle repair than cognitive speed.

Option F is taking regular afternoon naps. Napping can help with alertness and memory consolidation, which might make someone feel more alert. But does that translate to faster reaction times? Maybe a bit, but I'm not sure if it's the most effective way compared to exercise.

So, putting this together, the best bet seems to be aerobic exercise. It's known to enhance cardiovascular health, which in turn benefits the brain. Improved blood flow can make neural connections more efficient, leading to quicker reaction times. Therefore, option A is probably the correct answer.

The reaction time difference between younger and older adults is reduced when older adults practice regular aerobic exercise. Aerobic exercise enhances cardiovascular health, improving blood flow to the brain, which supports cognitive functions and neural efficiency, thereby reducing the reaction time gap.
