Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about relativistic momentum. Hmm, I remember that in relativity, the energy and momentum equations are different from the classical ones. Let me think about what I know.

The question says that the total energy of a particle is equal to twice its rest energy. Oh right, the rest energy is mc², right? So if the total energy E is twice that, then E = 2mc².

Wait, and I need to find the relativistic momentum. I remember the formula that relates energy, momentum, and mass. Oh right, it's E squared equals (pc) squared plus (mc²) squared. So E² = (pc)² + (mc²)².

Since E is 2mc², plugging that into the equation gives (2mc²)² = (pc)² + (mc²)². Let me write that out: 4m²c⁴ = p²c² + m²c⁴.

Hmm, I need to solve for p. Let's subtract m²c⁴ from both sides: 4m²c⁴ - m²c⁴ = p²c². That simplifies to 3m²c⁴ = p²c². 

Wait, let me make sure I did that right. Oh yeah, 4 minus 1 is 3, so yes, 3m²c⁴ equals p squared times c squared. So to solve for p², I divide both sides by c². That gives p² = (3m²c⁴) / c². Simplifying, that's 3m²c². 

Taking the square root of both sides, p equals sqrt(3) m c. Wait, sqrt(3) is 3^(1/2), so p = (3^(1/2)) mc. Let me check the options. Oh, option D says (3^(1/2)) mc, so that must be the right answer.

Wait, let me double-check the steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So starting from E=2mc², plug into E²=(pc)^2+(mc²)^2. Yes, that gives 4m²c^4 = p²c² + m²c^4. Subtracting, 3m²c^4=p²c². Dividing by c² gives p²=3m²c². Square root gives p= sqrt(3) mc. Yep, that's correct.

To determine the relativistic momentum of a particle when its total energy is twice its rest energy, we start with the relativistic energy-momentum relation:

\[
E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2
\]

The total energy \(E\) is given as \(2mc^2\), where \(mc^2\) is the rest energy. Substituting \(E = 2mc^2\) into the equation:

\[
(2mc^2)^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2
\]

Simplifying:

\[
4m^2c^4 = (pc)^2 + m^2c^4
\]

Subtracting \(m^2c^4\) from both sides:

\[
3m^2c^4 = (pc)^2
\]

Dividing through by \(c^2\):

\[
p^2 = 3m^2c^2
\]

Taking the square root:

\[
p = \sqrt{3}mc
\]

Thus, the relativistic momentum is \((3^{1/2})mc\). Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**D: \((3^{1/2})mc\)**
