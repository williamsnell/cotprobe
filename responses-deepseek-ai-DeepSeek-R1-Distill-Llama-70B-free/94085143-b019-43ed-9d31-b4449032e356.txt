Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this question about Italians' views on free media in 2019. The question is asking what percentage of Italians said it's very important to have free media without government censorship. The options are from A to J, with percentages ranging from 25% to 99%.

First, I remember that in many European countries, especially those with a history of political changes, the importance of free media is usually quite high. Italy has had its share of political issues, including media ownership concentration, especially with figures like Silvio Berlusconi who owned a lot of media outlets. So people might be sensitive about government censorship.

I think about surveys like those from Pew Research or similar organizations that track public opinion on such issues. I seem to recall that in some European countries, around 70-80% of people consider free media important. But Italy might have a different number.

Wait, I think in a Pew survey around that time, they asked about the importance of free media. For example, in some Western European countries, support was high. Maybe for Italy specifically, it was a bit lower than the highest options but still quite significant.

Looking at the options, the higher percentages are like 75% (F), 71% (E), 86% (G), 90% (I), 99% (D). Those seem quite high. I'm trying to remember if Italy's percentage was in the 70s or 80s.

Another angle: sometimes, the percentage can vary based on how the question is phrased. "Very important" might be a higher threshold than just "important." So maybe the number isn't as high as the 90s but still a solid majority.

I think I read somewhere that in Italy, around 71% of people said free media is very important. That would correspond to option E. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it's higher, like 86% (G), but I'm leaning towards the 70s.

Wait, another thought: if the question is from 2019, perhaps there were specific events in Italy that year affecting media perceptions. But I can't recall any major events that would drastically change the numbers that year.

Also, considering the options, 71% (E) and 75% (F) are close. If I'm trying to remember, which one was it? I think the exact figure I remember was 71%, so option E.

But wait, I'm a bit confused because sometimes the numbers can be higher. Let me think again. Maybe it was higher, like 86% as in option G. Hmm. I'm a bit torn here.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm mixing it up with another country's data. For example, in Germany, the percentage might be higher, but Italy's could be lower. But I'm not certain.

Wait, I think I read that Italy's support for free media was around 71%, so option E. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, if I'm wrong, maybe it's 86% (G). But without more specific information, I'll have to go with my initial thought.

The question asks about the percentage of Italians who considered free media very important in 2019. Considering Italy's history and sensitivity towards media censorship, the figure is likely high but not excessively so. While options like 86% (G) or 75% (F) are plausible, the recollection of a Pew survey suggests the figure was around 71%, aligning with option E. This seems reasonable given the context and the phrasing of "very important."

Answer: E
