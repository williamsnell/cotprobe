Okay, so I'm trying to answer this multiple-choice question about the VAR approach compared to full structural models. Let me think through each point carefully.

The question is asking which of the statements (i) to (iv) are advantages of VAR models. I remember that VAR stands for Vector Autoregressive model. From what I've studied, VAR models are a type of multivariate time series model. They're different from structural models, which are more theory-driven and have equations with restrictions based on economic theory.

Let's go through each statement one by one.

Statement i) says that VARs receive strong motivation from financial and economic theory. Hmm. I'm a bit fuzzy on this. Structural models are definitely built on strong theoretical foundations because they're based on economic theories. VARs, on the other hand, are more data-driven and don't impose as much structure. So I don't think VARs get strong motivation from theory; instead, they're more about capturing patterns in the data without assuming much about the underlying relationships. So statement i) is probably false.

Statement ii) claims that VARs in their reduced forms can be used easily to produce time-series forecasts. Yes, I remember that one of the main uses of VAR models is forecasting. Since they model each variable as a function of lagged values of themselves and other variables, they're straightforward to use for generating forecasts, especially in the reduced form where you don't have the complications of structural equations. So ii) is correct.

Statement iii) says VAR models are typically highly parsimonious. Parsimonious means using few parameters, right? VAR models usually include multiple lags and multiple variables, so the number of parameters can get large. Unless the model is very restricted, like with only a few variables and short lags, they might not be parsimonious. So iii) is probably incorrect.

Statement iv) states that OLS can be applied separately to each equation in a reduced form VAR. Yes, I think this is true. In a reduced form VAR, each equation is estimated independently using OLS. Since each equation is a linear regression of a variable on its own lags and the lags of others, you can estimate each one separately. So iv) is correct.

So, let's recap:

i) False. VARs aren't strongly theory-motivated.

ii) True. They are good for forecasting.

iii) False. Not typically parsimonious.

iv) True. OLS per equation is doable.

So the correct statements are ii) and iv). Now, looking at the options:

The options are A through J. Let me check each:

Option G says (ii) and (iv) only. That's exactly what we have. So the answer should be G.

The correct answer is G, as statements ii) and iv) are accurate advantages of the VAR approach.
