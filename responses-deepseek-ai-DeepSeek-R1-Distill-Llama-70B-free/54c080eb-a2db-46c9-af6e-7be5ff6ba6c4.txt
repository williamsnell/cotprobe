Okay, so I've got this physics problem here. Let me try to think through it step by step. The question is about power and work done when dragging an object. Hmm, I remember that power and work are related to force and motion.

Alright, the problem states that a constant horizontal force of 10 N is applied to drag an object across a rough surface at a constant speed of 5 m/s. They're asking for the power being expended and the work done in 30 minutes. The options are from A to J, each with different values.

First, I think about power. I remember that power is the rate at which work is done, and the formula is P = F * v, where F is force and v is velocity, but only when the force is applied in the direction of motion. Oh wait, right, because if the angle between force and velocity isn't zero, you have to consider the cosine of that angle. But here, the force is horizontal and the motion is horizontal, so the angle is zero. Cosine of zero is 1, so it's just F multiplied by v.

So the force here is 10 N, and the velocity is 5 m/s. Let's calculate that. 10 times 5 is 50. So the power should be 50 watts. That narrows down the options to those with 50 W. Let me check which options that is.

Looking at the options, options A, D, G have 50 W. So the power part is 50 W.

Next, the work done in 30 minutes. Wait, work is force times distance, right? So W = F * d. But I don't have distance directly. I have time and velocity.

Oh, right, because distance equals velocity multiplied by time. So first, I need to find the distance the object is moved in 30 minutes. But wait, time needs to be in seconds because velocity is in m/s. Let me convert 30 minutes to seconds.

30 minutes is 30 * 60 = 1800 seconds. Okay, so the distance d = 5 m/s * 1800 s = 9000 meters. Wait, that's 9 kilometers? That seems a lot, but okay, let's proceed.

So the work done is F * d. F is 10 N, d is 9000 m. So 10 * 9000 = 90,000 joules. Wait, but the options are in watt-hours. Oh right, because power is in watts and time is in hours sometimes.

Wait, 1 watt-hour is equal to 3600 joules because 1 watt is 1 joule per second, so 1 W-hr = 3600 J. So to convert 90,000 J to watt-hours, I divide by 3600.

90,000 / 3600 is 25. Because 3600 * 25 is 90,000. So 25 watt-hours.

Wait, but let me make sure. 30 minutes is 0.5 hours. Power is 50 W. So another approach is that work (in joules) is power multiplied by time in seconds. So 50 W * 1800 s = 90,000 J, which is the same as before. Then, converting that to watt-hours: 90,000 J / 3600 J per W-hr = 25 W-hr.

But wait some of the options don't have 25. Looking back, option G says 50 W and 25 W-hr. So that's one of the choices.

Alternatively, some might think in terms of power multiplied by time in hours. So 50 W * 0.5 hours = 25 W-hr. Yep, same result.

So the power is 50 W, the work is 25 W-hr. Looking at the options, that's option G.

Wait, but let me double-check the options. Option A is 50 W and 15 W-hr. No, that's not right. D is 50 W and 90 W-hr. That's way too big. G is 50 W and 25, which matches. So the answer should be G.

To determine the power and work done, we start with the formula for power:

\[
P = F \cdot v
\]

Here, the force \( F = 10 \, \text{N} \) and the velocity \( v = 5 \, \text{m/s} \). Substituting these values:

\[
P = 10 \cdot 5 = 50 \, \text{W}
\]

This matches the power value in options A, D, and G. Next, we calculate the work done in 30 minutes. Work is given by:

\[
W = F \cdot d
\]

The distance \( d \) can be calculated using \( d = v \cdot t \). Converting 30 minutes to seconds:

\[
t = 30 \cdot 60 = 1800 \, \text{s}
\]

Thus, the distance is:

\[
d = 5 \cdot 1800 = 9000 \, \text{m}
\]

Now, substituting \( F = 10 \, \text{N} \) and \( d = 9000 \, \text{m} \):

\[
W = 10 \cdot 9000 = 90,000 \, \text{J}
\]

To convert this to watt-hours (1 W-hr = 3600 J):

\[
W = \frac{90,000}{3600} = 25 \, \text{W-hr}
\]

Thus, the power is \( 50 \, \text{W} \) and the work done is \( 25 \, \text{W-hr} \). Comparing with the options, this corresponds to **option G**.
