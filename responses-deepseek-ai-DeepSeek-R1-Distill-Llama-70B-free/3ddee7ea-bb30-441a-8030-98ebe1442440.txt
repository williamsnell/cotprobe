Okay, so I've got this optics problem here about thin lenses and their refracting powers. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's see if I can work through it.

Alright, the question states that the principal refracting powers are +4 and -5 diopters. Wait, principal powers are along the principal meridians, right? So the lens is probably astigmatic since the two principal powers are different. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait. Wait, thin lenses can be either converging or diverging, but if the principal powers are different, then the lens must be astigmatic. Oh wait, no, wait. Wait, no, wait, sorry, I'm getting confused. Thin lenses, when they're spherical, have the same power in all meridians, right? So if the principal powers are different, then the lens must be astigmatic, meaning it's not spherical, like a cylindrical lens or something. So that's the case here.

So the problem says that the refracting power in an oblique normal section is +2 diopters. I remember that in such cases, the lens has different powers in different meridians because of the astigmatism. So the idea is that in any normal section (a plane that includes the optical axis), the power varies depending on the angle of the section relative to the principal meridians.

Wait, what's a normal section again? Oh right, a normal section is a plane that passes through the optical axis of the lens. So for an astigmatic lens, there are two principal meridians (perpendicular to each other) where the power is maximum and minimum. Any other normal section would have a power somewhere between these two.

So, given that the principal powers are +4 and -5 D, I think the maximum power is +4 D and the minimum is -5 D. Now, the problem says that in an oblique normal section (so a normal section that's not aligned with either principal meridian), the power is +2 D. We're asked to find two things: the power in the normal section that's perpendicular to this oblique one, and the angle between the +2 D section and the +4 D section.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me get this straight. So in any normal section, the power can be found using the formula: F = F1*cos²θ + F2*sin²θ, where F1 and F2 are the principal powers, and θ is the angle between the section and the principal meridian with power F1.

So in this problem, F1 is +4 D and F2 is -5 D. So let me denote θ as the angle between the oblique section (which has F=+2 D) and the +4 D principal meridian.

So we can set up the equation: 2 = 4*cos²θ + (-5)*sin²θ.

Hmm, let me compute that. Let's compute this equation.

Wait, cos²θ is (1 + cos2θ)/2 and sin²θ is (1 - cos2θ)/2. Alternatively, perhaps I can express this in terms of cos(2θ) because that might make things easier.

Wait, another approach: Let's write the equation as:

2 = 4 cos²θ -5 sin²θ.

We can express this using the identity cos²θ = 1 - sin²θ, but perhaps a better approach is to use the double-angle identity.

Alternatively, let's rewrite the equation as:

4 cos²θ -5 sin²θ = 2.

We can express this as:

(4)(cos²θ) + (-5)(sin²θ) = 2.

Let me think about how to solve for θ here. Maybe express everything in terms of cos(2θ).

We know that cos(2θ) = cos²θ - sin²θ, so cos²θ = (1 + cos2θ)/2 and sin²θ = (1 - cos2θ)/2.

Substituting into the equation:

4*( (1 + cos2θ)/2 ) -5*( (1 - cos2θ)/2 ) = 2.

Simplify each term:

4*(1 + cos2θ)/2 = 2*(1 + cos2θ) = 2 + 2 cos2θ.

-5*(1 - cos2θ)/2 = (-5/2)*(1 - cos2θ) = (-5/2) + (5/2) cos2θ.

So adding these together:

2 + 2cos2θ -5/2 + (5/2)cos2θ = 2.

Combine like terms:

2 - 5/2 = (4/2 -5/2) = (-1/2).

And for the cos2θ terms: 2cos2θ + (5/2)cos2θ = (4/2 +5/2) cos2θ = (9/2) cos2θ.

So equation becomes:

(-1/2) + (9/2) cos2θ = 2.

Now, add 1/2 to both sides:

(9/2) cos2θ = 2 + 1/2 = 5/2.

Multiply both sides by 2/9:

cos2θ = (5/2) * (2/9) ) = 5/9.

So cos2θ = 5/9.

Thus, 2θ = arccos(5/9).

Let me compute that. Hmm, arccos(5/9) is approximately... Well, let me think. 5/9 is approximately 0.5556. The arccos of 0.5556 is about 56 degrees (since cos(60°) is 0.5, so 56 is a bit more than that). Let me compute it more accurately.

Using a calculator: cos⁻¹(5/9) ≈ 56.25 degrees.

Wait, but wait, cos(56 degrees) is approximately 0.5592, which is about 5/9 ≈ 0.5556. So 2θ ≈ 56.25 degrees, so θ ≈ 28.125 degrees.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check. Alternatively, perhaps using more precise calculation.

But maybe I should move on and see if this is correct.

Wait, the question asks for two things: first, the power in the normal section that's perpendicular to the first oblique section, and second, the angle between the +2 D section and the +4 D section.

So, first, the power in the perpendicular section. Since the two sections are perpendicular, the angles would add up to 90 degrees, so the other section would be at θ + 90 degrees relative to the +4 D principal meridian.

Wait, no. Wait, let me think. The first section is at angle θ relative to the +4 D meridian. The second section is perpendicular to this first section, so the angle between the two sections is 90 degrees. Therefore, the angle of the second section relative to the +4 D meridian would be θ + 90 degrees.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of the sum of the angles. Alternatively, perhaps the other section is at θ + 90 degrees from the first principal meridian.

Wait, but perhaps a better approach is to model the two sections as being perpendicular. So, since the first section is at angle θ from the +4 D meridian, the second section would be at θ + 90 degrees. Alternatively, perhaps it's at some other angle that makes the two sections perpendicular.

Wait, but perhaps another approach is to note that the two sections are perpendicular, so the angles they make with the principal meridians would add such that the sum of their angles is 90 degrees. Wait, no, that's not necessarily correct. Because each section can be at any angle relative to the principal meridians, but being perpendicular as sections would mean that the planes are perpendicular, so their angles relative to the principal meridian would differ by 90 degrees.

Wait, perhaps it's easier to model the two sections as being perpendicular, so the angles θ1 and θ2 that each makes with the +4 D principal meridian would satisfy θ2 = θ1 + 90 degrees.

But perhaps a better approach is to realize that the two normal sections are perpendicular, so the sum of their angles with the principal meridian would be 90 degrees? Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, perhaps the two sections are separated by 90 degrees in their orientation.

Wait, perhaps another way to approach this is that the two sections are perpendicular, so the product of their slopes would be -1 if they were lines, but since they're planes, their dihedral angle is 90 degrees.

But perhaps I should think in terms of the refracting power in the second section, which is perpendicular to the first oblique section. So, since the first section is at angle θ to the +4 D meridian, the second section would be at θ + 90 degrees.

Alternatively, perhaps the angle between the two sections is 90 degrees, so the angle of the second section relative to the +4 D meridian would be θ + 90 degrees.

Wait, but perhaps this isn't the right approach. Let me think again.

Wait, in any case, for the second section, which is perpendicular to the first, I can model its angle as θ + 90 degrees from the +4 D principal meridian.

So, the power in the second section would be F' = 4 cos²(θ + 90) + (-5) sin²(θ + 90).

But wait, cos(θ + 90) is equal to -sinθ, and sin(θ + 90) is equal to cosθ. So:

F' = 4*(-sinθ)^2 + (-5)*(cosθ)^2
= 4 sin²θ -5 cos²θ.

Hmm, but we can express this in terms of F from the first equation.

Wait, from the first equation, we had F = 4 cos²θ -5 sin²θ = 2.

So, F' = 4 sin²θ -5 cos²θ.

Hmm, alternatively, perhaps we can find F' in terms of F.

Wait, let me see. Let's compute F + F':

F + F' = (4 cos²θ -5 sin²θ) + (4 sin²θ -5 cos²θ)
= (4 cos²θ -5 cos²θ) + (-5 sin²θ +4 sin²θ)
= (-cos²θ) + (-sin²θ)
= - (cos²θ + sin²θ)
= -1.

So, F + F' = -1.

We know that F is +2 D, so 2 + F' = -1 → F' = -3 D.

Wait, that's a neat result. So the power in the perpendicular section is -3 D.

Wait, but let me confirm that. Because if F is +2, then F' would be -3, as 2 + (-3) = -1.

So that seems correct.

Wait, but wait, let me check the calculation again.

Compute F + F':

F =4 cos²θ -5 sin²θ.

F' =4 sin²θ -5 cos²θ.

Adding them: 4 cos²θ -5 sin²θ +4 sin²θ -5 cos²θ.

Grouping terms:

cos²θ (4 -5) + sin²θ (-5 +4) → (-1) cos²θ + (-1) sin²θ → - (cos²θ + sin²θ) → -1.

Yes, correct. So F + F' = -1. So if F is 2, then F' = -3 D.

Wait, but let me make sure that this method is correct. Because the two sections are perpendicular, so perhaps this relation holds. So that's one part answered.

So the power in the perpendicular section is -3 D. Now, looking at the options, let's see which options have the first part as -3 D.

Looking at the options:

Option J: -3dptrs, 28° 7' 32''

So that's a possible candidate.

Other options don't have -3 as the first part except J.

Wait, but wait. Let me think again. So the first part is the power in the perpendicular section, which is -3 D.

Now, the second part is the angle of inclination of the +2 D section relative to the +4 D section, which is θ.

Earlier, we found that 2θ ≈ 56.25 degrees, so θ ≈ 28.125 degrees. Let's convert that into degrees, minutes, and seconds.

0.125 degrees is 0.125 * 60 = 7.5 minutes. 0.5 minutes is 30 seconds. So 7.5 minutes is 7 minutes and 30 seconds.

So θ ≈ 28 degrees, 7 minutes, 30 seconds. Approximately 28°7'30''.

Looking at the options, option J has 28°7'32'', which is very close to our calculation. So that must be the correct option.

Wait, but let me double-check the angle calculation because sometimes when dealing with trigonometric equations, there can be more than one solution in the 0-180 range.

We had cos2θ = 5/9, so 2θ could be in the first or fourth quadrant. But since 2θ is the angle whose cosine is positive (5/9 is positive), so 2θ must be in the first or fourth quadrants. But since θ is the angle between the section and the principal meridian, it's between 0 and 90 degrees, so 2θ is between 0 and 180 degrees. So 2θ can be either arccos(5/9) or 360° - arccos(5/9), but since we're dealing within 0 to 180, the other possibility is in the fourth quadrant, which might not apply here. So the acute angle is the correct one.

So, 2θ ≈ 56.25 degrees, so θ ≈ 28.125 degrees, which is 28 degrees and 7.5 minutes, which is 28°7'30''. The closest option is J, which is 28°7'32'', so that's very close.

Thus, the correct answer should be option J: -3dptrs, 28°7'32''.

The problem involves an astigmatic thin lens with principal refracting powers of +4 D and -5 D. A normal section (a plane containing the optical axis) is given to have a refracting power of +2 D. The task is to determine the refracting power in a normal section perpendicular to this oblique section and the angle of inclination of the +2 D section relative to the +4 D principal meridian.

### Key Analysis:
1. **Refracting Power in Perpendicular Section**:
   Using the relationship for refracting powers in perpendicular sections of an astigmatic lens:
   \[
   F + F' = -1
   \]
   where \( F = +2 \, \text{D} \) is the power in the oblique section, and \( F' \) is the power in the perpendicular section. Solving:
   \[
   F' = -1 - F = -1 - (+2) = -3 \, \text{D}.
   \]

2. **Angle of Inclination**:
   The refracting power in a normal section is given by:
   \[
   F = F_1 \cos^2\theta + F_2 \sin^2\theta,
   \]
   where \( F_1 = +4 \, \text{D} \), \( F_2 = -5 \, \text{D} \), and \( \theta \) is the angle between the oblique section and the principal meridian with \( F_1 = +4 \, \text{D} \). Substituting \( F = +2 \, \text{D} \):
   \[
   2 = 4 \cos^2\theta - 5 \sin^2\theta.
   \]
   Using trigonometric identities, this simplifies to:
   \[
   \cos(2\theta) = \frac{5}{9}.
   \]
   Solving for \( 2\theta \):
   \[
   2\theta = \arccos\left(\frac{5}{9}\right) \approx 56.25^\circ.
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   \theta = \frac{56.25^\circ}{2} \approx 28.125^\circ.
   \]
   Converting \( 0.125^\circ \) to minutes and seconds:
   \[
   0.125^\circ \times 60 = 7.5' \quad \text{and} \quad 0.5' \times 60 = 30''.
   \]
   Therefore, \( \theta \approx 28^\circ 7' 30'' \), which closely matches the value \( 28^\circ 7' 32'' \) provided in the options.

### Final Answer:
The refracting power in the perpendicular section is \( -3 \, \text{D} \), and the angle of inclination is approximately \( 28^\circ 7' 32'' \). The correct option is:

**J: -3dptrs, 28° 7' 32''**
