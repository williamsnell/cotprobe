Okay, so I have this chemistry problem in front of me. It's about electrochemistry, specifically dealing with cell potentials and calculating the pH of a solution. Hmm, I remember that cell potential, E, relates to the concentrations of the ions involved through the Nernst equation. Let me try to break this down.

The cell notation given is H₂(1 atm) | HCl | AgCl | Ag. Wait, so this is a hydrogen electrode on the left and a silver-silver chloride electrode on the right. I think the hydrogen electrode is the anode, and the silver is the cathode. Or wait, what's the standard E° for this cell? Oh, the problem says E° is 0.2220 V at 298 K. But the measured E is 0.396 V, which is higher than the standard. So that must mean the cell is under non-standard conditions, and the Nernst equation will help here.

I recall the Nernst equation is E = E° - (RT/nF) ln Q, but sometimes it's written with a log, like E = E° - (0.0592/n) log Q at 25°C. Wait, the temperature is 298 K, which is about 25°C, so I can use the 0.0592 V per log approximation.

But wait, what's the cell reaction here? Let me think. The anode is where oxidation happens. For the hydrogen electrode, oxidation would be H₂ → 2H⁺ + 2e⁻. Right. And the cathode is where reduction occurs. The AgCl electrode probably involves AgCl(s) + e⁻ → Ag(s) + Cl⁻. So for each AgCl, one electron is gained. Since the anode produces two electrons, the cathode reaction must happen twice. So overall, the cell reaction would be:

H₂ + 2 AgCl → 2 H⁺ + 2 Cl⁻ + 2 Ag.

Wait, is that right? Let me check. The anode: H₂ → 2H⁺ + 2e⁻. The cathode: 2 AgCl + 2e⁻ → 2 Ag + 2 Cl⁻. So combining them, it's H₂ + 2 AgCl → 2 H⁺ + 2 Cl⁻ + 2 Ag. So the net ionic equation is H₂ + 2 AgCl → 2 H+ + 2 Cl⁻ + 2 Ag.

So in terms of concentrations, the reaction quotient Q would be [H+]² [Cl⁻]^2 divided by (P_H2) (assuming AgCl is a solid and doesn't contribute). Since P_H2 is 1 atm, it's omitted from Q, so Q = [H+]^2 [Cl⁻]^2.

Wait, but wait. In this setup, the HCl solution is the electrolyte. So [H+] is from HCl, which is a strong acid, so it dissociates completely. So [H+] = [Cl⁻] = concentration of HCl, let's call it c. So [H+] = c, [Cl⁻] = c. Therefore, Q = (c)^2 * (c)^2 = c^4.

So Q = c^4. Wait, but let's think again. The cell reaction produces H+ and Cl⁻ from H₂ and AgCl. So the products are in the solution. So the concentrations of H+ and Cl⁻ are increasing as the reaction proceeds. But in this case, the HCl solution is the source, so [H+] and [Cl⁻] are from HCl.

Wait, but wait another thing. The standard cell potential is given as 0.2220 V. The standard conditions would imply that all concentrations are 1 M, and H₂ is at 1 atm. So when the cell is operating under standard conditions, E is 0.222 V. But here, the measured E is higher (0.396 V), so the cell is producing more voltage than standard. That suggests that the reaction is more spontaneous under these conditions. So the reaction quotient Q must be less than K, meaning the reaction is proceeding forward more, so E is higher.

Wait, the Nernst equation is E = E° - (0.0592/n) log Q. Or is it plus? Wait, no, the equation is E = E° - ( (RT)/(nF) ) * ln Q. But when using log, it's divided by (n) and multiplied by 0.0592, but with a negative sign. So when E is higher than E°, that would mean that (E° - E) is negative, so the term with log Q must be negative. Let me get this straight.

Let me write the Nernst equation properly. For the reaction as written:
E = E° - (0.0592 V / n) * log Q.

Here, n is the number of electrons transferred. In the overall reaction, how many electrons are involved? The anode releases 2e⁻, and the cathode accepts 2e⁻ (since two AgCl are reduced, each needing one e⁻). So n=2.

So E = 0.2220 V - (0.0592/2) * log Q.

But wait, the measured E is 0.396 V. So plugging in:

0.396 = 0.2220 - (0.0296) * log Q.

Wait, no, that can't be right. Because 0.222 is less than 0.396, so when I subtract (something) from 0.222, I get a higher value? That doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I have the sign wrong. Let me think again.

The Nernst equation can also be written as E = E° + ( (0.0592 V)/n ) * log ( reaction quotient under nonstandard conditions ), but I might be mixing up the terms. Wait, I think I should write the cell potential in terms of the cathode minus the anode.

Wait, perhaps I should approach this differently. Let me determine the cell reaction and then write the Nernst equation correctly.

The cell is H₂ (g) | H+ (from HCl) || AgCl | Ag.

Wait, no, the cell is written as H₂ | HCl | AgCl | Ag. So this is a concentration cell? Or not exactly. Let me think about the two half-cells.

The hydrogen electrode is H₂ gas bubbling through a solution of H+ (from HCl), so it's the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) if the H+ is 1 M. But in this case, the H+ is from HCl, which is at a certain concentration, so it's not standard. The other half-cell is the Ag/AgCl electrode, which is in contact with Cl⁻ from the HCl solution as well.

Wait, but AgCl is Ag+ and Cl⁻. So the Ag/AgCl electrode's potential depends on the Cl⁻ concentration. So maybe the two half-cells are both in the same solution (HCl), so it's a cell where both electrodes are in contact with the same solution. But that would make it a concentration cell, but I'm not sure.

Wait, but the cell notation is H2(1 atm) | HCl | AgCl | Ag. So the left side is hydrogen gas in HCl solution, and the right side is AgCl and Ag in the same solution. So the HCl solution is the electrolyte for both half-cells. So the two electrodes are in the same solution, meaning that the H+ and Cl⁻ concentrations are the same in both half-cells. Hmm, that's a bit tricky.

In the hydrogen electrode, the reaction is H+ + e⁻ → ½ H₂ (reduction), but since it's acting as the anode in this cell, the reverse is happening: oxidation. So H₂ → 2 H+ + 2 e⁻.

For the Ag/AgCl electrode, the reaction is AgCl + e⁻ → Ag + Cl⁻ (reduction). Since Ag is a solid, and AgCl is also a solid, the concentration of Cl⁻ affects the potential here.

In this setup, since both electrodes are in the same solution, the H+ and Cl⁻ concentrations are the same for both.

So the cell reaction would be: H₂ + 2 AgCl → 2 H+ + 2 Cl⁻ + 2 Ag.

Wait, but considering that the H+ and Cl⁻ are products, but since they're in solution, their concentrations will affect the cell potential.

So the Nernst equation for the cell would be E = E°cell - ( (0.0592 V)/n ) * log Q.

n here is the number of electrons transferred. For the hydrogen electrode, each H₂ releases 2 e⁻, and each AgCl accepts 1 e⁻, so for two AgCl, 2 e⁻ are accepted. So n=2.

So the reaction quotient Q is [H+]^2 [Cl⁻]^2 divided by (P_H2 * [AgCl]^2), but AgCl is a solid, so it's activity is 1. P_H2 is 1 atm, so it's also 1. So Q = [H+]^2 [Cl⁻]^2.

But wait, [H+] and [Cl⁻] are both from HCl. Since HCl is a strong acid, [H+] = [Cl⁻] = c, where c is the concentration of HCl. So Q = (c)^2 * (c)^2 = c^4.

So Q = c^4.

Now, plugging into the Nernst equation:

E = E° - (0.0592 / 2) * log (c^4 )

Which simplifies to:

E = E° - (0.0296) * 4 * log c

Because log(c^4) = 4 log c.

So E = 0.2220 V - (0.1184) * log c.

But wait, in the problem, the measured E is 0.396 V. So:

0.396 = 0.2220 - 0.1184 * log c.

Wait, that can't be right. Let's compute the right-hand side. 0.2220 minus 0.1184 times log c equals 0.396. Let me rearrange:

0.396 - 0.2220 = -0.1184 * log c.

0.174 = -0.1184 * log c.

Divide both sides by -0.1184:

log c = 0.174 / (-0.1184) ≈ -1.47.

So log c ≈ -1.47. Therefore, c = 10^(-1.47) ≈ 10^(-1.47) is about 0.034. Wait, 10^(-1) is 0.1, 10^(-1.5) is about 0.0316. So 10^(-1.47) is around 0.034.

Wait, but wait. Let me double-check the setup. Because I'm getting log c = negative number, so c is less than 1. But if the cell potential is higher than standard, what does that mean about the reaction? Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign in the Nernst equation. Let me think again. The correct Nernst equation is E = E° - (0.0592/n) log Q. So in our case:

E = 0.2220 - (0.0592/2) * log Q.

But the way I defined Q, it's [H+]² [Cl⁻]^2. So when c is less than 1, Q would be less than 1, making log Q negative. Then (0.0592/2) * log Q would be negative, so E would be E° minus a negative, which is E° plus a positive. That would make E larger than E°, which is what we have here (0.396 > 0.222). So that makes sense.

So, continuing with the calculation:

log c = (0.2220 - 0.396) / ( (0.0592/2) * 4 )

Wait, wait, perhaps I messed up the equation earlier. Let me write it again.

E = E° - (0.0592/n) * log Q.

Q is [H+]^2 [Cl⁻]^2 = (c^2)(c^2) = c^4.

So log Q = log(c^4) = 4 log c.

So,

E = 0.2220 - (0.0592/2) * (4 log c )

Simplify that:

0.0592/2 is 0.0296. Multiply by 4, we get 0.1184.

So,

E = 0.2220 - 0.1184 * log c.

We have E = 0.396 V.

So,

0.396 = 0.2220 - 0.1184 * log c.

Rearranging:

0.396 - 0.2220 = -0.1184 * log c.

0.174 = -0.1184 * log c.

So,

log c = -0.174 / 0.1184 ≈ -1.47.

So log c ≈ -1.47 → c ≈ 10^(-1.47) ≈ 0.034.

Wait, but c is the concentration of HCl, which is a strong acid. So [H+] = 0.034 M. Then pH would be -log(0.034).

Calculating pH:

-log(0.034) = log(1/0.034) ≈ log(29.41) ≈ 1.47.

Wait, that would make pH ≈ 1.47, which is option B or F or I. Let me check the options.

Looking back, the options are:

A:4.47, B:1.47, C:3.47, D:0.74, E:2.74, F:1.75, G:0.47, H:3.74, I:2.47, J:1.74.

So 1.47 is option B.

Wait, but wait a minute. I think I made a mistake in the calculation of log c. Let me recalculate.

log c = -1.47 → c = 10^(-1.47) = 10^(-1) * 10^(-0.47) ≈ 0.1 * 0.34 ≈ 0.034.

So [H+] = 0.034 M. So pH = -log(0.034).

Let me compute that more accurately. Log(3.4e-2) = log(3.4) + (-2). Log(3.4) is about 0.5315. So pH = 2 - 0.5315 ≈ 1.4685, which is approximately 1.47.

So the pH is 1.47, which is option B.

Wait, but wait another thing. Did I account for the correct number of electrons? The overall reaction has 2 electrons (from H₂ to 2AgCl). So n=2, which I used correctly.

Another check: when E is higher than E°, the reaction is more spontaneous, which suggests that the products are more favored. Products are H+ and Cl⁻, so higher concentrations of H+ and Cl⁻ would lower E, not increase it. Hmm, wait, that seems contradictory.

Wait, no. Let's think: under standard conditions, E is 0.222 V. If E increases, it suggests that the cell is producing a higher voltage, meaning that the forward reaction is more favorable. So the reaction quotient Q must be less than K, which under standard conditions would be when Q=1.

Wait, but in the Nernst equation, when E > E°, it implies that the cell is more spontaneous, so the reaction is proceeding forward. So Q must be less than K. But in standard conditions, Q is 1 (since concentrations are 1M). So for Q < 1, that would mean the reaction is proceeding forward, which increases E. So if Q is less than 1, log Q is negative, which makes the ( - (0.0592/n) log Q ) term positive, thus E = E° + positive term. So that's correct.

So in our case, the calculated Q is c^4 = (0.034)^4 ≈ (3.4e-2)^4 ≈ (3.4)^4 * 1e-8. 3.4^2 is about 11.56, so 3.4^4 is about (11.56)^2 ≈ 133.6, so 133.6e-8 → 1.336e-6. So Q is about 1.336e-6, which is much less than 1, which aligns with E being higher than E°.

So the calculation seems correct. Therefore, the pH is approximately 1.47, which is option B.

To determine the pH of the HCl solution, we analyze the given electrochemical cell:

**Cell notation:**  
H₂(1 atm) | HCl | AgCl | Ag  

**Given data:**  
- Standard cell potential: \( E^\circ = 0.2220 \, \text{V} \)  
- Measured cell potential: \( E = 0.396 \, \text{V} \)  
- Temperature: \( 298 \, \text{K} \)  

### Step 1: Write the cell reaction
The hydrogen electrode (anode) undergoes oxidation:  
\[
\text{H₂} \rightarrow 2\text{H⁺} + 2\text{e⁻}
\]  
The silver-silver chloride electrode (cathode) undergoes reduction:  
\[
2\text{AgCl} + 2\text{e⁻} \rightarrow 2\text{Ag} + 2\text{Cl⁻}
\]  
Combining these, the overall reaction is:  
\[
\text{H₂} + 2\text{AgCl} \rightarrow 2\text{H⁺} + 2\text{Cl⁻} + 2\text{Ag}
\]

### Step 2: Define the reaction quotient \( Q \)
The reaction quotient is based on the concentrations of \(\text{H⁺}\) and \(\text{Cl⁻}\), which are equal since HCl is a strong acid. Let the concentration of HCl be \( c \). Then:  
\[
[\text{H⁺}] = [\text{Cl⁻}] = c
\]  
The reaction quotient is:  
\[
Q =
