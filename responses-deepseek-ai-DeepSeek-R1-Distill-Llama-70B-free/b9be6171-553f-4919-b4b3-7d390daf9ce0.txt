Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure it out. Let's see what it's asking. Erin made 12 pints of juice, and she drinks 3 cups each day. The question is, how many days will it take her to drink all the juice? Hmm.

Wait, I remember that pints and cups are units of measurement, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact conversions. I think there's a way to convert pints to cups so that the units match. Oh right, I think 1 pint is equal to 2 cups. Yeah, that sounds right. So if Erin has 12 pints, how many cups is that?

Let me write that down. 12 pints multiplied by 2 cups per pint. So 12 * 2 equals 24 cups. Oh wait, wait, no, that can't be right. Because 1 pint is 2 cups, so 12 pints would be 12 times 2, which is 24 cups. Yeah, that makes sense.

Now, Erin drinks 3 cups each day. So to find out how many days she'll take to finish all the juice, I need to divide the total number of cups by the amount she drinks each day. So that's 24 cups divided by 3 cups per day. 

Let me do the division. 24 divided by 3 equals 8. So that would mean she takes 8 days to drink all the juice. 

Wait, but let me double-check the units to make sure I didn't make a mistake. She starts with pints, converts to cups correctly, right? 1 pint is 2 cups, so 12 pints are 24 cups. She drinks 3 cups a day. 24 divided by 3 is 8. Yeah, that seems correct.

So looking at the options, H is 8 days. So the answer should be H.

To determine how many days Erin will take to drink all the juice, we first convert pints to cups. Since 1 pint equals 2 cups, 12 pints is:

\[
12 \text{ pints} \times 2 \text{ cups/pint} = 24 \text{ cups}
\]

Erin drinks 3 cups of juice each day. The number of days she will take to finish 24 cups is:

\[
24 \text{ cups} \div 3 \text{ cups/day} = 8 \text{ days}
\]

Thus, the correct answer is **H: 8 days**.
