Okay, so I've got this question about polymer molecular weights. Hmm, I need to find the number average (Mn) and weight average (Mw) molecular weights. Let me think about what each of these means.

Alright, I remember that the number average molecular weight is calculated as the sum of the mole fractions multiplied by their respective molecular weights. Wait, no, wait. Oh right, Mn is calculated as (sum of (mole fraction * molecular weight)) but wait, no, actually, I think it's the reciprocal of the sum of (mole fraction divided by molecular weight). Or is it the other way around? Wait, no, Mn is (sum (N_i * M_i)) / (sum N_i), which in terms of mole fractions. Since mole fraction is X_i = N_i / N_total, then Mn = sum(X_i * M_i). Oh wait, no! Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me be careful.

Wait, no, Mn is the number average, which is (sum (N_i * M_i)) / (sum N_i). Since N_i is the number of moles, for each component, N_i = X_i * n_total, where X_i is mole fraction and n_total is total moles. So it's (sum (X_i * n_total * M_i)) / (sum (X_i * n_total)) ). The n_total cancels out, so Mn = sum(X_i * M_i). Oh, wait, no! Wait, no, no. Wait, that would be the mole average, but I think I'm mixing up.

Wait, no, Mn is the average molecular weight based on the number of molecules. So for each molecule, its M_i contributes, so the formula is sum(X_i * M_i) because X_i is the fraction of molecules with M_i. Oh wait, no, that's the correct formula for Mn. So yeah, Mn = X1*M1 + X2*M2.

Then, for Mw, the weight average, it's a bit different. Mw is calculated as sum( (mass fraction) * M_i ). But mass fraction is (moles of i * M_i) divided by total mass. So Mw = sum( (X_i * M_i) * M_i ) / sum( X_i * M_i ). Wait, because each component contributes (X_i * M_i) as their mass fraction. So Mw is (sum (X_i * M_i^2)) / (sum (X_i * M_i))).

Wait, no. Let me get this straight. The weight average is given by Mw = (sum (w_i * M_i)) / (sum w_i), where w_i is the weight fraction of each component. But weight fraction is (n_i * M_i) / (sum (n_j * M_j)). So substituting, Mw becomes (sum ( (n_i M_i) / sum(n_j M_j) ) * M_i )) / (sum ( (n_i M_i) / sum(n_j M_j) )) ). Oh wait, that's complicated. Alternatively, since X_i is n_i / n_total, then the mass fraction w_i is (n_i M_i) / (n_total sum X_j M_j). So w_i = (X_i M_i) / (sum X_j M_j). Then Mw is sum(w_i M_i) = sum( (X_i M_i)/(sum X_j M_j) ) * M_i ). So that's sum( (X_i M_i^2) ) / (sum X_j M_j ). So Mw is (X1 M1² + X2 M2²) / (X1 M1 + X2 M2).

Wait, so in this problem, X1 is 0.5 and X2 is 0.5. M1 is 1e5, M2 is 2e5.

So for Mn:

Mn = X1*M1 + X2*M2 = 0.5 *1e5 + 0.5 *2e5 = 0.5*(1e5 + 2e5) = 0.5 * 3e5 = 1.5e5 = 150,000 g/mol.

For Mw, it's (X1 M1² + X2 M2²) / (X1 M1 + X2 M2). Let's compute numerator and denominator.

Denominator is same as Mn, which is 1.5e5.

Numerator: 0.5*(1e5)^2 + 0.5*(2e5)^2 = 0.5*(1e10 +4e10) = 0.5 *5e10 = 2.5e10.

So Mw = 2.5e10 / 1.5e5 = (2.5e10) / (1.5e5) = (2.5/1.5) * 1e5 = (5/3) *1e5 ≈ 1.666...e5 = 166,666... g/mol.

So Mn is 150,000, Mw is approximately 166,666.

Wait, looking at the options, let's check which has Mn=150k and Mw=166k.

Looking at the options:

Option E: Mn=150k, Mw=1.5e5? No, that's 150k for both? No.

Option D: Mn=150k, Mw=2e5.

Option B: Mn=150k, Mw=1.67e5. Wait, 1.67e5 is 167,000. So that's 1.67 times 1e5, which is 167,000. So B would have Mn=150k, Mw=1.67e5.

Wait, 1.67e5 is 167,000, which is what I calculated.

So the correct answer should be option E? Wait no, looking back:

Wait, options:

Option E: Mn=150k, Mw=1.5e5? No, 1.5e5 is 150,000, which is the same as Mn. That doesn't make sense because Mw is always greater than or equal to Mn.

Option B: Mn=150k, Mw=1.67e5. Oh wait, 1.67e5 is 167,000. So that makes sense.

So the correct Mn is 150,000 and Mw is approximately 166,666, which is 1.67e5.

Looking at the options, option B is Mn=150k and Mw=1.67e5. So the correct answer is option B.

To calculate the number average molecular weight (\(M_n\)) and the weight average molecular weight (\(M_w\)) for the given polymer sample, the following formulas are used:

1. **Number Average Molecular Weight (\(M_n\))**:  
   \[
   M_n = \sum (X_i \cdot M_i)
   \]  
   where \(X_i\) is the mole fraction and \(M_i\) is the molecular weight of each component.

2. **Weight Average Molecular Weight (\(M_w\))**:  
   \[
   M_w = \frac{\sum (X_i \cdot M_i^2)}{\sum (X_i \cdot M_i)}
   \]  

### Given Data:
- Component 1: \(X_1 = 0.5\), \(M_1 = 100,000 \, \text{g/mol}\)  
- Component 2: \(X_2 = 0.5\), \(M_2 = 200,000 \, \text{g/mol}\)  

### Calculation of \(M_n\):
\[
M_n = (X_1 \cdot M_1) + (X_2 \cdot M_2)
\]
\[
M_n = (0.5 \cdot 100,000) + (0.5 \cdot 200,000)
\]
\[
M_n = 50,000 + 100,000 = 150,000 \, \text{g/mol}
\]

### Calculation of \(M_w\):
First, calculate the numerator and denominator:  
- Numerator:  
\[
\sum (X_i \cdot M_i^2) = (0.5 \cdot 100,000^2) + (0.5 \cdot 200,000^2)
\]
\[
= (0.5 \cdot 10^{10}) + (0.5 \cdot 4 \cdot 10^{10}) = 0.5 \cdot 10^{10} + 2.0 \cdot 10^{10} = 2.5 \cdot 10^{10}
\]

- Denominator:  
\[
\sum (X_i \cdot M_i) = 150,000 \, \text{g/mol} \, (\text{from } M_n \text{ calculation})
\]

Now, calculate \(M_w\):  
\[
M_w = \frac{\sum (X_i \cdot M_i^2)}{\sum (X_i \cdot M_i)} = \frac{2.5 \cdot 10^{10}}{150,000}
\]
\[
M_w = \frac{2.5 \cdot 10^{10}}{1.5 \cdot 10^5} = \frac{2.5}{1.5} \cdot 10^5 = 1.67 \cdot 10^5 \, \text{g/mol}
\]

### Final Results:
- \(M_n = 150,000 \, \text{g/mol}\)  
- \(M_w = 1.67 \cdot 10^5 \, \text{g/mol}\)  

### Matching with Options:
The correct option is **B**, which states:  
\(M_n = 150,000 \, \text{g/mol}, M_w = 1.67 \cdot 10^5 \, \text{g/mol}\).

Answer: B
