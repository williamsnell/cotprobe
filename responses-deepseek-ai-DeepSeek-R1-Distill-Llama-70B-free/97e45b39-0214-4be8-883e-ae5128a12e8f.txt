Okay, so I've got this question about federalism and I'm trying to figure out the right answer. I'm a bit new to political science terms, so I'll take it step by step.

The question is asking which option best defines federalism. The options are from A to J. I remember that federalism has something to do with how power is divided in a country, but I'm not exactly sure of the specifics.

Let me think about what I've heard before. Federalism, as I recall, is a system where power isn't just held by one central government but is shared with smaller units, like states or provinces. So it's the opposite of a unitary system where the national government holds all the power. 

Looking at the options now:

Option A says the national government controls all subnational units. That sounds more like a unitary system, not federalism. So A is probably not the correct answer.

Option B is the division of a country's power into national and subnational units. Hmm, that fits with what I was thinking. Federalism divides power so both levels have their own areas of authority.

Option C says power is primarily held by subnational units. Wait, isn't that more like confederation? In a confederation, the subnational units have more power. Federalism is more about sharing, so C doesn't sound right.

Option D talks about dividing power among political parties. That doesn't seem related. It's more about how different parties might share power, but that's not what federalism is about. So D is out.

Option E is about dividing national power into different branches, like executive, legislative, etc. That's separation of powers, a different concept. So E isn't the answer.

Option F is accumulation of all power in one unit. That's definitely not federalism. It's the opposite, maybe authoritarian or something.

Option G mentions a political and religious leader being the same. That sounds like a theocracy, so not relevant here.

Option H is sharing power with international organizations. I don't think that's federalism. Maybe international cooperation, but not the same.

Option I is power concentrated in a small group. That's more like oligarchy, not federalism.

Option J is transferring power from national to subnational. That's decentralization, which can be a part of federalism, but I'm not sure if it's the best definition.

Wait, so going back. Federalism is about dividing power between national and subnational. So B says the division into national and subnational units. J says transferring power, which might be part of it, but B seems more accurate as a definition.

So the best answer should be B. I think that's the correct choice.

The best definition of federalism is the division of a country's power into national and subnational units. This reflects the essence of federalism, where authority is shared between central and local governments, distinct from systems where power is concentrated or transferred. 

Answer: B
