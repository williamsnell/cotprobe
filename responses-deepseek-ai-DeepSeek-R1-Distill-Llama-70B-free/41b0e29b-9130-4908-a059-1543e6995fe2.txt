Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question with three parts, a, b, and c, each having two subparts. I'll need to tackle each part step by step. Let me start with part a.

Part a is about laminar flow between two parallel plates. The velocity profile is given by u = u_m [1 - (b²/B²)], where u_m is the centerline velocity, B is half the spacing between the plates, and b is the distance from the center plane.

First, question (1): What is the average velocity in terms of u_m? I remember that the average velocity for a laminar flow between plates can be found by integrating the velocity profile over the area and dividing by the area. Since the flow is symmetric, I can consider from 0 to B and double it, but wait, actually, the equation is given as a function of b, which ranges from -B to B, but perhaps it's easier to think in terms of y from 0 to 2B. Hmm, but maybe it's better to set up the integral properly.

Wait, the velocity profile is u = u_m [1 - (b²/B²)]. So, to find the average velocity V_avg, I can integrate u across the area and divide by the area. The area is (2B * W), where W is the width (since it's between two plates, the length in the other dimension is W, but since we're dealing with velocity per unit width, maybe W cancels out).

So, V_avg = (1/(2B)) * ∫(from b=-B to B) u db. Because for flow between plates, the distance from the center plane is b, so the total height is 2B.

Wait, but integrating from -B to B, the function is even, because (b²) is even. So I can compute 2 * ∫ (from 0 to B) u db and then divide by 2B.

So, let me compute the integral:

∫ u db from 0 to B is u_m ∫ [1 - (b²/B²)] db.

Integrating term by term:

∫ 1 db = b evaluated from 0 to B → B.

∫ (b²/B²) db = (1/B²) * (b^3/3) evaluated from 0 to B → (1/B²)(B^3/3) = B/3.

So the integral from 0 to B is u_m [B - (B/3)] = u_m (2B/3).

Then, the average velocity becomes (1/(2B)) * 2 * (u_m (2B/3)) ) → because the 2 comes from the symmetry.

Wait, wait, let me retrace. The total area is 2B * width. The integral of u over the area is ∫ u db * width. So average velocity is [ ∫ u db * W ] / (2B * W) ) → [ ∫ u db ] / (2B).

But since u is symmetric, the integral from -B to B is 2 times the integral from 0 to B. So:

V_avg = (2 ∫0^B u db ) / (2B) ) → [ ∫0^B u db ] / B.

Which is [u_m (2B/3)] / B = (2 u_m)/3. So V_avg = (2/3) u_m.

Wait, wait, no: The integral from 0 to B is u_m (2B/3), as I calculated before. Then, when I take [ ∫0^B u db ] / B, that's (2B/3 u_m) / B = 2/3 u_m. So V_avg is (2/3) u_m.

So question (1) for part a is (2/3) u_m.

Now, part (2) of a: the momentum correction factor beta. The formula for beta is the ratio of the momentum flux to the momentum flux if the flow were at uniform velocity V_avg. So beta = (1/A) ∫ (u^2) dA / V_avg^2.

So, beta = [ ∫ (u^2) dA ] / (A V_avg^2).

Since the velocity profile is u = u_m [1 - (b²/B²)], then u^2 = u_m^2 [1 - (b²/B²)]^2.

The area A is 2B*W (area between the plates), but when integrating, perhaps we can model it as integrating over the width W (unit width) and from b = -B to B.

But for simplicity, since we can compute per unit width, perhaps we can model it as a 2B height.

Let me compute the integral of u^2 over the area. Per unit width:

∫ (u^2) db from b = -B to B = 2 ∫0^B u^2 db (since it's even function).

So, ∫ u^2 db from 0 to B is u_m^2 ∫ [1 - 2(b²/B²) + (b^4/B^4)] db.

Integrate term by term:

∫1 db = B.

∫ (b²/B²) db = (1/B²) * (b^3/3) evaluated from 0 to B → B/3.

Similarly, ∫ (b^4/B^4) db = (1/B^4)(b^5/5) from 0 to B → B/5.

Putting it all together:

∫ u^2 db = u_m^2 [ B - 2*(B/3) + (B/5) ) ].

Compute the coefficients:

B [1 - 2/3 + 1/5 ].

Let me compute 1 - 2/3 = 1/3. Then 1/3 + 1/5 = (5 + 3)/15 = 8/15.

So, ∫ u^2 db from 0 to B → u_m^2 B (8/15).

Then, the total integral over the area (from -B to B) is 2 * u_m^2 B (8/15) = (16 u_m^2 B)/15.

Wait, wait, no: the integral from 0 to B is u_m^2 * B*(8/15) → because 1 - 2/3 + 1/5 = 8/15.

But when you integrate from -B to B, you double this, so 2 * [u_m^2 * B*(8/15)] = (16 u_m^2 B)/15.

Wait, no, no, the integral from -B to B is 2 * integral from 0 to B, so yes, that's correct.

So the numerator in beta is (16 u_m^2 B/15) per unit width. The area A is 2B (for unit width, since W=1, area = 2B*1).

So beta is [ (16 u_m^2 B/15) ] / [ (2B) * (V_avg)^2 ) ].

We know V_avg is (2/3) u_m, so V_avg^2 is (4/9) u_m^2.

So substituting:

beta = [ (16 u_m^2 B/15) ] / [ 2B * (4/9 u_m^2) ) ].

Simplify:

The B and u_m^2 terms cancel out.

So: (16/15) / ( 2 * (4/9) ) → (16/15) / (8/9) ) = (16/15) * (9/8) ) = (16 *9) / (15*8) ) = (144)/(120) = 1.2.

So beta is 1.20.

So for part a, the average velocity is (2/3) u_m and beta is 1.20.

Looking back at the options, I need to find which option matches this for part a. Let's look at the options:

Option E: (a) Average velocity = (2/3) u_m, beta = 1.20.

Yes, that's correct for part a.

Now, moving on to part b.

Part b is about turbulent flow in a circular tube. The velocity profile is given as u = u_m (y/R)^{1/7} = u_m [1 - (r/R)]^{1/7}, where u_m is the centerline velocity, R is the radius, and y is the distance from the wall (r = R - y).

Wait, so y is the distance from the wall, so when r = R, y = 0, and when r = 0, y = R.

So the velocity at the center (r=0) is u_m (R/R)^{1/7} = u_m, as expected.

First, question (1): What is the average velocity in terms of u_m?

The average velocity for pipe flow is the integral of the velocity over the area divided by the area.

In polar coordinates, the area element is dA = 2π r dr (since circumference is 2πr and thickness dr). Wait, but wait: since the velocity is given as a function of r, with r being the radial distance from the center, perhaps it's better to express u in terms of r.

Wait, the velocity is given as u = u_m (y/R)^{1/7}, where y is the distance from the wall, so y = R - r. So u = u_m [ (R - r)/R ]^{1/7} = u_m (1 - r/R )^{1/7}.

So, to find the average velocity, integrate u over the area and divide by the area.

The area of the pipe is π R².

So, V_avg = (1/(π R²)) ∫ (from r=0 to R) u(r) * 2π r dr.

So, V_avg = (2π / π R²) ∫0^R u(r) r dr → (2/(R²)) ∫0^R u(r) r dr.

Substituting u(r) = u_m (1 - r/R)^{1/7}.

So,

V_avg = (2 u_m / R²) ∫0^R (1 - r/R)^{1/7} r dr.

Let me make a substitution: let x = r/R → r = x R → dr = R dx.

When r=0, x=0; r=R, x=1.

So,

V_avg = (2 u_m / R²) ∫0^1 [ (1 - x)^{1/7} ] * (x R) * R dx.

Simplify:

= (2 u_m / R²) * R^2 ∫0^1 x (1 - x)^{1/7} dx.

R^2 cancels with 1/R^2 → 2 u_m ∫0^1 x (1 - x)^{1/7} dx.

Now, the integral ∫ x (1 - x)^{n} dx from 0 to 1 is a Beta function. The integral of x (1 - x)^n dx from 0 to 1 is B(2, n+1) ) = Γ(2) Γ(n+1)/Γ(2 + n +1).

But Γ(2) = 1! = 1, Γ(n+1) = n!, and Γ(2 + n +1 ) = (n+2)!.

Alternatively, using substitution, but perhaps I can compute it as a Beta function.

Wait, more directly, the integral ∫0^1 x (1-x)^{1/7} dx can be expressed using Beta function as B(2, 1/7 +1) ) = B(2, 8/7).

The Beta function B(a,b) = Γ(a)Γ(b)/Γ(a+b).

So, B(2,8/7) = Γ(2)Γ(8/7)/Γ(2 +8/7) = Γ(2)Γ(8/7)/Γ(22/7).

But Γ(2) = 1! = 1.

And Γ(8/7) is approximately ... well, perhaps I should compute this integral numerically.

Alternatively, I can compute it using the formula for the Beta function in terms of factorials, but since 8/7 is not an integer, that might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, perhaps using substitution: Let t = 1 - x → dt = -dx. When x=0, t=1; x=1, t=0.

So, the integral becomes ∫1^0 (1 - t) t^{1/7} (-dt) → ∫0^1 (1 - t) t^{1/7} dt.

Which is ∫0^1 t^{1/7} (1 - t) dt = ∫0^1 t^{1/7} - t^{8/7} dt.

So,

= [ t^{(1/7 +1)} / (1/7 +1) ) ] from 0 to 1 - [ t^{(8/7 +1)} / (8/7 +1) ) ] from 0 to 1.

Compute each term:

First term: (7/8) t^{8/7} evaluated from 0 to 1 → 7/8 (1 - 0) = 7/8.

Second term: (7/15) t^{15/7} evaluated from 0 to 1 →7/15 (1 -0 )=7/15.

So, the integral is 7/8 -7/15 = (105/120 - 56/120) )=49/120.

So, the integral is 49/120.

Thus, V_avg = 2 u_m * (49/120) ) = (98/120) u_m = (49/60) u_m.

So, V_avg is (49/60) u_m.

That's part (1) of part b.

Now, part (2): the momentum flux factor beta.

Beta is defined as the ratio of the momentum flux to the momentum flux assuming uniform velocity V_avg.

So, beta = (1/A) ∫ u^2 dA / (V_avg)^2.

In this case, A is the area of the pipe, π R^2.

So, beta = [ ∫ u^2 dA ] / (A (V_avg)^2 ).

Compute ∫ u^2 dA.

Again, using polar coordinates.

u(r) = u_m (1 - r/R )^{1/7}.

So, u^2 = u_m^2 (1 - r/R )^{2/7}.

The area element dA = 2 π r dr.

So,

∫ u^2 dA = ∫0^R [u_m^2 (1 - r/R )^{2/7} ] 2 π r dr.

= 2 π u_m^2 ∫0^R r (1 - r/R )^{2/7} dr.

Again, substituting x = r/R → r = x R → dr = R dx.

So,

= 2 π u_m^2 ∫0^1 (x R) (1 - x )^{2/7} R dx.

= 2 π u_m^2 R² ∫0^1 x (1 - x )^{2/7} dx.

Now, compute the integral ∫0^1 x (1 - x )^{2/7} dx.

Again, using substitution t = 1 - x → x = 1 - t, dx = -dt. Limits from t=1 to t=0.

So, integral becomes ∫1^0 (1 - t) t^{2/7} (-dt) → ∫0^1 (1 - t) t^{2/7} dt.

= ∫0^1 t^{2/7} - t^{9/7} dt.

Compute each term:

∫ t^{2/7} dt = [ t^{(2/7 +1)} / (2/7 +1) ) ] from 0 to1 → (7/9) t^{9/7} ] from 0 to1 →7/9.

∫ t^{9/7} dt = [ t^{(9/7 +1)} / (9/7 +1) ) ] from 0 to1 → (7/16) t^{16/7} ] →7/16.

So, the integral is 7/9 -7/16 = (112/144 - 63/144 )=49/144.

So, ∫ u^2 dA = 2 π u_m^2 R² (49/144).

Now, the area A is π R².

So, beta = [ 2 π u_m^2 R² (49/144) ] / [ π R² (V_avg)^2 ].

Simplify:

The π R² terms cancel, leaving beta = [ 2 u_m^2 (49/144) ] / (V_avg^2 ).

We know V_avg is (49/60) u_m → V_avg^2 = (49²)/(60²) u_m^2.

So,

beta = [ 2 * 49/144 * u_m^2 ] / [ (49²)/(60²) u_m^2 ) ]

Simplify:

The u_m^2 cancels.

beta = (2 *49 * 60² ) / (144 *49² )

Simplify numerator and denominator:

49 cancels, so:

= (2 * 60² ) / (144 *49 )

= (2 * 3600) / (144 *49 )

Calculate numerator: 2*3600=7200.

Denominator:144 *49=7056.

So, beta=7200/7056 ≈ 1.020408.

So approximately 1.0204.

Looking at the options, part b beta is approximately 1.020. Let me check the options:

Looking at part b's beta in the options:

Option E: beta =1.020.

Yes, that's correct.

So for part b, average velocity is (49/60) u_m and beta is approximately 1.020.

Now, part c: Velocity measurements in equal increments of (r/R)^2, representing equal area increments. The velocities are given as 18.2, 16.8, 14.9, 12.75, 10.9, 9.4, 7.9, 6.5, 5.6, and 4.5 m/s.

There are 10 points, which suggests 10 equal area increments, so each ring represents an equal fraction of the total area. Since the area increases with (r/R)^2, each increment in
