Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about protons in the LHC collider. Hmm, I remember that the LHC uses protons in a collider setup, but the question is about a fixed-target experiment. I need to find the available center-of-mass energy in GeV.

Wait, what's the difference between collider and fixed-target? Oh right, in a collider, both protons are moving towards each other with high energy. In fixed-target, one proton is stationary, and the other hits it. So the energy calculations are different.

The given energy per proton is 7.0 TeV. That's a lot! I think I need to convert that to a more manageable unit, maybe GeV. Oh wait, 1 TeV is 1000 GeV, so 7 TeV is 7000 GeV each.

But wait, no, the question says it's 7.0 TeV protons. So each proton has a kinetic energy? Or is it their total energy? I think in particle physics, when they say beam energy, it's the kinetic energy. But sometimes people refer to the total energy as well. Hmm, the problem isn't entirely clear, but I'll proceed with the assumption that it's the total energy, but I might need to double-check that.

In a fixed-target setup, the center-of-mass energy (sqrt(s)) is calculated differently than in a collider. For a collider, it's sqrt(2 * E1 * E2 * (1 + cos theta)), but when theta is 180 degrees (head-on), cos theta is -1, so it becomes sqrt(2 * E1 * E2 * 0) which doesn't make sense. Wait, no, wait. No, in a collider where both protons have energy E, the center-of-mass energy is sqrt(4 E^2) because each has energy E, so s = (E + E)^2 = (2E)^2, so sqrt(s) is 2E. But wait, only if they're moving in opposite directions. So for collider, the COM energy is 2E if each proton has energy E. 

But in fixed-target, one is at rest, so the target proton's energy is its rest mass energy, which is about 0.938 GeV (since a proton's mass is roughly 938 MeV). The projectile has energy E. So the total energy squared s is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. But since the target is at rest, p2 is zero. So s = (E + m_p c^2)^2 - (p c)^2, where p is the projectile's momentum. 

Wait, for the projectile, E^2 = (pc)^2 + (m c^2)^2. So p c = sqrt(E^2 - (m c^2)^2).

So substituting back, s = (E + m c^2)^2 - (sqrt(E^2 - m^2 c^4))^2 / c^2 * c^2. Oh, the units are getting a bit tangled here. Let me think in natural units where c=1. Then:

s = (E + m)^2 - (E^2 - m^2) = E² + 2 E m + m² - E² + m² = 2 E m + 2 m².

Wait, so that's (E + m)^2 - (E² - m²) because the momentum term is sqrt(E² -m²), so when squared, it's E² - m². So expanding:

(E + m)^2 = E² + 2Em + m².

Subtract (E² - m²) gives:

E² + 2Em + m² - E² + m² = 2Em + 2m² = 2m(E + m).

So sqrt(s) would be sqrt(2m(E + m)).

Wait, but wait, in natural units, m is in GeV/c², and E is in GeV. So let's plug in the numbers.

The projectile proton has energy E = 7 TeV = 7000 GeV. The target is at rest, so its energy is m_p c² = 0.938 GeV.

So m = 0.938 GeV/c². E =7000 GeV.

So the COM energy squared is s = 2 * m * (E + m). Let me compute that.

s = 2 * 0.938 GeV * (7000 + 0.938) GeV.

Wait, because m is in GeV/c² and E is in GeV, but when multiplied, the units would be GeV^2. But wait, because in natural units, c=1, so E and mass are in the same units when c is accounted for.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of units without c. Let me make sure.

Alternative approach: in particle physics, the center-of-mass energy when a projectile of energy E strikes a stationary target of mass m is given by:

sqrt(s) = sqrt(2 * m * E + 2 m^2 )

Because s = (E + m)^2 - p^2 = (E +m)^2 - (E^2 - m^2) ) = 2 m E + 2 m².

So sqrt(s) = sqrt(2 m (E + m)).

Wait, but E is the kinetic energy or the total energy? Oh, this is a crucial point. Because sometimes, E is given as kinetic energy (K), and sometimes as total energy (which is K + m c²).

In the problem, it says the protons are produced with 7.0 TeV. I think in accelerator physics, when they say a beam has a certain energy, it's usually the kinetic energy. So the total energy E_total = K + m c².

Wait, but let me think again. The LHC's proton beams are each 7 TeV, meaning each has a total energy (kinetic + rest) of 7 TeV. So the rest energy is 0.938 GeV, so the kinetic energy K is 7e3 GeV - 0.938 GeV ≈ 6999.062 GeV.

Wait, but for the purposes of calculating the COM energy, perhaps using the total energy is correct. Because in the formula, E is the total energy of the projectile.

Wait, let me clarify: when a projectile has energy E, which includes its rest mass, then the target at rest has energy m. So in the formula, yes, E is the total energy of the projectile.

So in our case, E = 7 TeV =7000 GeV. m = 0.938 GeV.

So s = 2 * 0.938 GeV * (7000 GeV + 0.938 GeV) = 2 * 0.938 *7000.938 GeV².

Let me compute that.

7000.938 is approximately 7000.938 ≈ 7000.94 GeV.

So 2 * 0.938 *7000.94 = approx 2 * 0.938 *7000.

Wait, 0.938 *7000 = 6566. So 2 *6566 = ~13132 GeV².

So sqrt(13132 GeV²) is sqrt(13132) GeV. Let's compute sqrt(13132).

What's sqrt(13132)? Let's think. 114 squared is 12996 (because 100²=10000, 110²=12100, 114²= (110+4)^2=110² + 2*110*4 +4²= 12100 +880 +16=12996.

So 114²=12996, 115²=13225.

Our value is 13132, which is between 114² (12996) and 115² (13225).

Compute 13132-12996=136. So 114 + 136/(2*114 +1) ≈ 114 + 136/(229)= approx 114 + ~0.594. So approx 114.594 GeV.

Wait, the options are: A:200, B:114.5, etc. So option B is 114.5, which is close to our calculation.

Wait, but wait, I may have messed up the formula. Because when I computed s, I used E as the total energy (7000 GeV), but perhaps I should use the kinetic energy instead.

Let me reevaluate.

If E is the kinetic energy (K), then the total energy is E_total = K + m c². So in that case, the formula would have E = K + m.

Wait, let me make this clear. The formula is sqrt(s) = sqrt(2 m (E + m)), where E is the total energy of the projectile, including rest mass. So if the given 7.0 TeV is the kinetic energy, then E_total = 7e3 GeV + 0.938 GeV ≈7000.938 GeV.

But if the 7.0 TeV is the total energy, then E is 7000 GeV.

Wait, the problem states that the protons are produced at 7.0 TeV. I think in high-energy physics, when they refer to the beam energy, it's the kinetic energy. So E_total would be K + m c², so 7e3 GeV is K, and m c² is 0.938 GeV. So E_total =7000.938 GeV.

Wait no, that doesn't make sense. Because 7 TeV is way larger than the rest mass. So in that case, K is 7e3 GeV, E_total is 7e3 + 0.938 ≈7e3 GeV. But for the purposes of calculation, the difference is negligible. So using E =7e3 GeV in the formula would give a result very close to using E=7000.938 GeV.

So my earlier calculation of approx 114.59 GeV, which is option B:114.5 GeV.

Wait, but let me recompute s precisely.

s = 2 * m * (E + m)

m =0.938 GeV

E =7000 GeV (assuming that 7TeV is the total energy)

So s= 2 * 0.938 * (7000 +0.938) = 2 *0.938 *7000.938.

Compute 7000.938 *0.938:

7000 *0.938 = 7000*(9/10 * 0.838?) Wait, 0.938 is approximately 0.9 +0.038.

7000 *0.9=6300.

7000 *0.038=266.

So 6300 +266=6566.

Then 0.938 *0.938 is ~0.88.

So 7000.938 *0.938≈6566 +0.88=6566.88 GeV.

Multiply by 2: 6566.88 *2=13133.76 GeV².

So sqrt(13133.76)= approx 114.58 GeV.

Looking at the options, option B is 114.5, which is very close. So the correct answer should be B.

But wait, another thought: when the target is at rest, the COM energy is given by sqrt(2 m E_lab), where E_lab is the kinetic energy of the projectile. Or is it the total energy?

Wait, I think I might have mixed up the formula. Let me double-check the formula for fixed-target experiments.

The center-of-mass energy squared, s, is (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c + p2 c)^2. Since the target is at rest, p2=0, and E2 = m c².

Projectile: E1 = kinetic energy + m c² = K + m c². Its momentum p1 is sqrt( (E1)^2 - (m c²)^2 ) / c.

So s = (E1 + E2)^2 - (p1 c)^2.

Substituting E2 = m c², and p1 c = sqrt(E1^2 - (m c²)^2 ), we have:

s = (E1 + m c²)^2 - (E1^2 - m² c^4 )

Expanding (E1 + m c²)^2: E1² + 2 E1 m c² + m² c^4.

Subtract (E1^2 - m² c^4 ): E1² + 2 E1 m c² + m² c^4 - E1^2 + m² c^4.

Simplify: 2 E1 m c² + 2 m² c^4 = 2 m c² (E1 + m c²).

So s = 2 m c² (E1 + m c²).

Taking square root: sqrt(s) = sqrt( 2 m c² (E1 + m c²) ) / c²? Wait, units might be getting me confused. Maybe better to work in natural units where c=1.

In natural units, c=1, so E1 is in GeV, m is in GeV/c², but since c=1, m is GeV.

Wait, no. Natural units: c=1, ħ=1. Mass m is in GeV/c², but when c=1, mass is GeV.

Wait, perhaps I should just stick to the formula in natural units.

So s = 2 m (E + m ), where E is the total energy in GeV, m is mass in GeV.

So sqrt(s) = sqrt(2 m (E + m )).

In our case, E =7 TeV =7000 GeV. m=0.938 GeV.

So s=2 *0.938*(7000 +0.938) =2 *0.938 *7000.938.

As I calculated earlier, this is about 13133.76 GeV², so sqrt(s) ≈114.58 GeV.

Which matches option B:114.5.

So the correct answer should be B.

To determine the available center-of-mass energy in a fixed-target experiment where 7.0-TeV protons collide with stationary protons, we use the formula for the center-of-mass energy squared, \( s \), in natural units (\( c = 1 \)):

\[
s = 2m(E + m),
\]

where:
- \( m \) is the rest mass of the proton, approximately \( 0.938 \, \text{GeV} \),
- \( E \) is the total energy of the moving proton, which is given as \( 7.0 \, \text{TeV} = 7000 \, \text{GeV} \).

Substituting the values:
\[
s = 2 \cdot 0.938 \cdot (7000 + 0.938).
\]

First, calculate \( 7000 + 0.938 = 7000.938 \). Then:
\[
s = 2 \cdot 0.938 \cdot 7000.938 \approx 2 \cdot 0.938 \cdot 7000 = 13132 \, \text{GeV}^2.
\]

Taking the square root:
\[
\sqrt{s} = \sqrt{13132} \approx 114.59 \, \text{GeV}.
\]

This value is very close to option **B: 114.5 GeV**. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**B: 114.5**
