Okay, so I've got this physics problem in front of me. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, the question is about a copper penny and the charges it contains. I remember that copper atoms have protons in the nucleus and electrons orbiting around. The problem says that the penny weighs 3.1 grams. Oh wait, and it contains equal amounts of positive and negative electricity. So I'm supposed to find the magnitude of these charges, q.

Let me read the data again. Each copper atom has a positive nuclear charge of 4.6 × 10^-18 C. And the negative electronic charge is the same in magnitude. Oh, right, because for each proton, there's an electron with the same charge but opposite sign. Copper's molar mass is given as 64 g/mol. 

So my plan is:

1. Calculate the number of moles in the penny. Since the penny's mass is 3.1 grams, I can divide by the molar mass to get moles.
2. Use Avogadro's number to find the number of atoms.
3. Multiply the number of atoms by the charge per atom to get the total charge.

Wait, but each atom has a positive and a negative charge. Since the problem says the amounts are equal, does that mean I should calculate just one of them? Like, the positive charge is equal to the negative, so the magnitude q is the same for both.

Let me start with the first step. Moles = mass / molar mass. So 3.1 grams divided by 64 g/mol. Let me calculate that. 3.1 / 64 is approximately 0.0484375 moles.

Then, number of atoms is moles multiplied by Avogadro's number, which is about 6.022e23 atoms/mol. So 0.0484375 * 6.022e23 = let me compute that. 0.0484375 * 6.022e23. Hmm, 0.0484375 is 48.4375e-3, so 48.4375e-3 * 6.022e23 = (48.4375 * 6.022) * 1e20. Let's approximate 48 *6 is 288, so maybe around 290e20? Wait, exact calculation: 48.4375 *6.022 = let's see, 48 *6=288, 0.4375 *6=2.625, so 290.625. So 290.625e20 atoms. Or 2.90625e22 atoms. Wait, no, 48.4375e-3 is 4.84375e-2. So 4.84375e-2 *6.022e23 = 4.84375 *6.022 * 1e21. 4.84375 *6.022 is approximately 29.16, so 29.16e21, which is 2.916e22 atoms. So about 2.916e22 atoms.

Each atom has a positive charge of 4.6e-18 C. So total positive charge is number of atoms multiplied by 4.6e-18 C. So 2.916e22 * 4.6e-18. Let's compute that. Multiply 2.916 by 4.6. 2.916 *4 is 11.664, 2.916 *0.6 is 1.7496. So total is 13.4136. Then the exponents: 1e22 *1e-18 = 1e4. So 13.4136e4 C. Wait, 13.4136e4 is 1.34136e5 C. Hmm, but looking at the options, option H is 1.3e5 C. That looks close. But wait, let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, I think I might have messed up the number of atoms. Let me recalculate that. Moles = 3.1 g / 64 g/mol = approximately 0.0484375 mol. Avogadro's number is 6.022e23, so number of atoms is 0.0484375 * 6.022e23. 

0.0484375 is the same as 484375/1e7, but maybe better to compute directly.

0.0484375 * 6.022e23 = let's compute 0.0484375 *6.022 = 

0.0484375 *6 = 0.290625

0.0484375 *0.022 = 0.001046875

Adding them: 0.290625 + 0.001046875 = 0.291671875

So 0.291671875e23 atoms. Because 6.022e23 is multiplied by 0.0484375, so 0.291671875e23 = 2.91671875e22 atoms.

Now, each atom has a charge of 4.6e-18 C. So total charge q is 2.9167e22 *4.6e-18.

Let me compute 2.9167e22 *4.6e-18:

Multiply 2.9167 *4.6: 2.9 *4.6 is about 13.34, 0.0167*4.6≈0.076, so 13.416. Then exponents: 1e22 *1e-18 =1e4. So 13.416e4 C = 1.3416e5 C. Which is approximately 1.34e5 C.

Looking at the options, option H is 1.3 ×10^5 C. That seems to match.

Wait, but wait a second. Let me think again. The penny has equal amounts of positive and negative charge. So the positive charge is q, the negative is also q. But the question is asking for the magnitude of these charges. So calculating the positive charge gives me q, which is 1.34e5 C. But looking at the options, option H is 1.3e5. That's one of the choices.

But wait, let me check the options again. Option H is 1.3e5 C, which matches. But wait, another thought: the charge per atom is 4.6e-18 C. Each atom contributes one positive and one negative charge? Or is that the nuclear charge, and the electronic charge is the same magnitude?

Wait the problem states: each copper atom has a positive nuclear charge of 4.6e-18 C and a negative electronic charge of equal magnitude. So each atom contributes a net charge of zero, but the total positive charge in the penny is the sum of all the positive charges, and similarly for the negative charges. Since the amounts are equal, the magnitude q is the same for both.

So when I calculate the positive charge, that's the q, and the negative is the same. So the magnitude is correct as 1.3e5 C.

Looking back at the options, option H is 1.3 ×10^5 C which is 1.3e5. So that's the right answer.

Wait, but let me check my calculation again because sometimes I might have messed up the exponents. Let me compute 2.9167e22 *4.6e-18.

2.9167e22 is 2.9167 × 1e22.

4.6e-18 is 4.6 ×1e-18.

Multiply the coefficients: 2.9167 *4.6 = let's compute this accurately.

2.9167 *4 = 11.6668

2.9167 *0.6 = 1.75002

Adding them: 11.6668 +1.75002=13.41682.

Then, exponents: 1e22 *1e-18=1e4.

So 13.41682e4 C → which is 1.341682e5 C. So approximately 1.34e5 C, which is 1.3e5 when rounded to two significant figures, matching option H.

Wait, but wait. The initial mass was 3.1 grams, which is two significant figures. So our final answer should also have two significant figures. 1.3e5 has two, so that's correct.

So the correct answer should be option H.

To determine the magnitude of the charges in a copper penny, we start by calculating the number of moles of copper in the penny. The mass of the penny is given as 3.1 g, and the molar mass of copper is 64 g/mol. Using the formula:

\[
\text{Moles of copper} = \frac{\text{Mass}}{\text{Molar mass}} = \frac{3.1}{64} \approx 0.0484375 \, \text{mol}.
\]

Next, we calculate the number of copper atoms in the penny using Avogadro's number (\(6.022 \times 10^{23} \, \text{atoms/mol}\)):

\[
\text{Number of atoms} = \text{Moles} \times \text{Avogadro's number} = 0.0484375 \times 6.022 \times 10^{23} \approx 2.916 \times 10^{22} \, \text{atoms}.
\]

Each copper atom has a positive nuclear charge of \(4.6 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{C}\). Therefore, the total positive charge in the penny is:

\[
q_{\text{total}} = \text{Number of atoms} \times \text{Charge per atom} = 2.916 \times 10^{22} \times 4.6 \times 10^{-18}.
\]

First, multiply the coefficients:

\[
2.916 \times 4.6 \approx 13.416.
\]

Then, add the exponents:

\[
10^{22} \times 10^{-18} = 10^{4}.
\]

Thus:

\[
q_{\text{total}} \approx 13.416 \times 10^{4} = 1.3416 \times 10^{5} \, \text{C}.
\]

Rounding to two significant figures (consistent with the given data), we get:

\[
q_{\text{total}} \approx 1.3 \times 10^{5} \, \text{C}.
\]

From the options provided, the closest match is:

**H: \(1.3 \times 10^{5} \, \text{C}\)**.

Therefore, the magnitude of the charges is:

**H: \(1.3 \times 10^{5} \, \text{C}\)**.

Answer: H
