Okay, so I have this problem about heat transfer across an air space in a wall. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to think it through.

The question gives me the emissivity of both surfaces as 0.90. Oh right, emissivity is a measure of how well a surface radiates energy. Both inner and outer surfaces have the same emissivity here.

The wall is 6 inches thick and 9 feet high. Wait, but the question asks about the heat transfer rate per square foot, so maybe the height doesn't matter for the area? Or wait, no, the area for a vertical wall would be based on height and width, but since we're looking for per square foot, perhaps the specific dimensions beyond thickness might not directly affect the calculation beyond knowing it's vertical.

The surface temperatures are given: inner at 95°F and outer at 125°F. Wait, wait, no, wait. The inner wall surface is at 95°F, and the outer is at 125°F. Or is it the other way around? Because usually, heat flows from higher to lower temperature. So if the outer surface is hotter, that might mean the heat is moving outward. But in a wall, the inside might be cooler than the outside, like in a heated building where the outside is colder. Wait, but in this case, the inner surface is 95°F and the outer is 125°F. So the outer is hotter. So heat would flow inward. But wait, that's the opposite of usual. Unless maybe the wall is in a situation where the outside is warmer, like in summer cooling, and the inside is cooler. So heat would transfer from outside to inside through the wall.

But for the calculation, maybe it's about radiative heat transfer between the two surfaces. Because when you have an air space, like a cavity between two walls, heat transfer can occur via radiation and conduction/convection. But in this problem, I think we're only considering radiation because the emissivity is given, and the question is about the emissivity of the surfaces.

Wait, but the problem says "determine the total heat transfer rate across the air space." So maybe both radiation and conduction are considered. But I'm not sure. The question's options are all in the range of about 20 to 65 Btu/hr-ft², which is a pretty big range, but I'm trying to remember the formulas.

I think the formula for radiative heat transfer between two surfaces is given by the Stefan-Boltzmann law, modified by emissivity and the geometry. The formula is Q = σ * ε * A * (T1^4 - T2^4) / (1/ε1 + 1/ε2 - 1). Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, for two parallel surfaces, each with emissivity ε, the effective emissivity is (ε1 * ε2)/(1 + ε1 + ε2 - ε1*ε2), but I might be mixing things up.

Wait, let me think again. The net radiative heat flux between two surfaces facing each other (like in this case) can be calculated by:

q = (σ * (T1^4 - T2^4)) / (1/ε1 + 1/ε2 - 1)

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, another approach is to model it as each surface emits radiation, and the net transfer is the difference.

Wait, Stefan-Boltzmann law is Q = σ ε A (T^4), but when you have two surfaces, you have to account for both emitting and absorbing.

Alternatively, the formula I might be remembering is q = (σ (T1^4 - T2^4)) / ( (1/ε1) + (1/ε2) - 1 ) )

Wait, perhaps that's correct. Because each surface's emissivity affects how much they emit and absorb.

So in this case, ε1 and ε2 are both 0.90. So substituting, the denominator becomes 1/0.9 + 1/0.9 -1.

Calculating that: 1/0.9 is approximately 1.1111. So 1.1111 + 1.1111 = 2.2222. Subtract 1, gives 1.2222.

So denominator is approx 1.2222.

Then, the numerator is σ*(T1^4 - T2^4).

Wait, but the temperatures are given in Fahrenheit. Oh right, I need to convert them to absolute temperatures, either Kelvin or Rankine, because the Stefan-Boltzmann law uses absolute temperatures.

So T1 is 95°F. To convert to Rankine: T(°R) = T(°F) + 459.67.

So T1 = 95 + 459.67 = 554.67 R.

T2 is 125°F. So T2 = 125 + 459.67 = 584.67 R.

Wait, but wait, which one is T1 and which is T2? The inner surface is at 95°F (T1=554.67 R), outer at 125°F (T2=584.67 R). So T2 is higher than T1. So the heat transfer should be from outer to inner, but since the wall's outer surface is hotter, heat is moving inward.

So the formula would be q = σ (T2^4 - T1^4) / denominator.

Wait, no, because if T2 > T1, then T2^4 > T1^4, so the heat would transfer from 2 to 1, which is from the outer to inner surface.

But let's get back to the calculation.

Compute T1^4 and T2^4.

But wait, maybe it's easier to compute (T2^4 - T1^4).

But wait, doing exact calculations with these numbers might be tedious, but perhaps I can compute the difference.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute each term.

σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, which is approximately 0.1714 ×10^-8 Btu/hr-ft²-°R^4.

Wait, yes, I think that's right. So σ = 0.1714e-8 Btu/(hr·ft²·°R⁴)

So putting it all together:

q = (σ * (T2^4 - T1^4)) / ( (1/ε1) + (1/ε2) -1 )

So let's compute T2^4 and T1^4.

T1 = 554.67 R, T2=584.67 R.

Compute T1^4:

554.67^4. Hmm, let's compute step by step.

554.67 squared is approximately 554.67^2.

554.67 * 554.67 = Let's compute 550^2 = 302500.

But 554.67 is 550 +4.67.

(550 +4.67)^2 = 550² + 2*550*4.67 + (4.67)².

550²=302500.

2*550*4.67=1100*4.67= 5,137.

4.67²≈ 21.8.

So total is 302500 + 5137 + 21.8≈ 307,658.8.

Now, T1^2= approx 307,658.8 R².

Then, T1^4 is (T1^2)^2 = (307,658.8)^2.

Wait, that's a huge number. Maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps using a calculator approach, but since I can't do that, perhaps I can find the approximate values.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute T2^4 - T1^4 as (T2² + T1²)(T2² - T1²) = (T2^2 + T1^2)(T2 - T1)(T2 + T1)).

But that might not save much time. Alternatively, perhaps I can compute (T2^4 - T1^4) as (T2 - T1)(T2 + T1)(T2² + T1²).

Wait, but let's see:

Compute T2 - T1 = 584.67 - 554.67 = 30 R.

T2 + T1 = 584.67 +554.67=1139.34 R.

Now, compute T2² and T1².

Wait, T1 is 554.67, T2 is 584.67.

T1²=554.67^2= approx 307,658. As before.

T2²=584.67^2.

Again, 580^2=336,400.

584.67 is 580 +4.67.

So (580 +4.67)^2 =580^2 + 2*580*4.67 +4.67^2.

580^2=336,400.

2*580*4.67= 1160 *4.67≈ 5,421.2.

4.67²≈21.8.

So total T2²≈336400 +5421.2 +21.8≈341,843 R².

So T2²= ~341,843 R².

So T2^2 + T1^2= 307,658.8 + 341,843≈ 649,501.8 R².

So now, (T2^4 - T1^4)= (30) * (1139.34) * (649,501.8).

Wait, let's compute each part.

First, 30 * 1139.34 = 34,180.2.

Then, 34,180.2 * 649,501.8.

That's a huge number. Let me approximate.

34,180.2 * 649,501.8 ≈ 34,000 * 650,000.

Which is 34e4 * 650e3 = 34 * 650 * 1e7 = 22,100 * 1e7 = 2.21e12.

But wait, let me be more precise.

Wait, 34,180 * 649,501.8 = ?

Approximating, 34,180 ≈34.18e3, 649,501.8≈649.5e3.

So 34.18e3 * 649.5e3 = 34.18 * 649.5 * 1e6.

Compute 34.18 * 649.5:

First, 34 * 650 = 22,100. But let's do it more accurately.

34.18 * 649.5 = ?

Compute 34 *649.5= 34*(600+49.5)=34*600=20,400; 34*49.5=1,683. So total 22,083.

Then, 0.18 * 649.5≈116.91.

So total ≈22,083 + 116.91≈22,199.91.

So approximately 22,200 * 1e6 = 2.22e13.

Wait, no, wait, because 34.18e3 * 649.5e3 = (34.18 * 649.5) * 1e6.

Which is approx 22,200 * 1e6 = 2.22e10.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused with the exponents. Let me think again.

Wait, 34.18e3 is 34,180, and 649.5e3 is 649,500. So when you multiply them, you get 34,180 * 649,500.

Which is 34,180 * 649,500 = ?

But perhaps it's easier to compute as (3.418e4) * (6.495e5) )= 3.418 *6.495 * 1e9.

3.418 *6.495 ≈ Let's compute that.

3*6=18, 3*0.495=1.485, 0.418*6=2.508, 0.418*0.495≈0.206.

Hmm, perhaps alternatively, 3.418 *6.495:

3.418 *6=20.508.

3.418 *0.495: Let's compute 3.418 *0.4=1.367, 3.418 *0.095≈0.324. So total 1.367 +0.324=1.691.

So total 20.508 +1.691=22.199.

So 22.199 * 1e9 =2.2199e10.

So (T2^4 - T1^4) ≈2.2199e10 R^4.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 2.22e13, but that must have been a mistake in the exponent. So it's about 2.22e10 R^4.

Now, the denominator is 1.2222, as computed before.

So putting it all together:

q = σ * (T2^4 - T1^4) / denominator.

σ=0.1714e-8 Btu/(hr·ft²·°R^4).

So,

q = 0.1714e-8 * (2.22e10) / 1.2222.

Compute numerator: 0.1714e-8 * 2.22e10 = 

0.1714e-8 *2.22e10 = 0.1714 *2.22 * 1e2.

Because 1e-8 *1e10=1e2.

So 0.1714 *2.22 ≈0.380.

So 0.380 *1e2=38.0.

Then, divide by 1.2222: 38.0 /1.2222 ≈31.08.

So q≈31.08 Btu/hr-ft².

Looking at the options, the closest is option B:30.46, option F:35.46, option A:45.46.

Wait, 31 is closest to 30.46 (option B) but wait, perhaps my approximation is off.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating (T2^4 - T1^4). Let me recheck.

Wait, perhaps I should compute T1 and T2 in Rankine correctly.

Wait, 95°F to Rankine is 95 +459.67=554.67 R.

125°F is 125+459.67=584.67 R.

So, correct.

Then, T2^4 - T1^4= (584.67^4 -554.67^4).

But perhaps a better approach is to compute each T to the fourth power.

Alternatively, perhaps using the formula:

(T2^4 - T1^4) = (T2 - T1)(T2 + T1)(T2² + T1²).

We have:

T2-T1=30 R.

T2+T1=1139.34 R.

T2²=584.67²= approx 584.67 *584.67.

Wait, 580^2=336,400. 584.67 is 580+4.67.

As before, 584.67^2≈341,843 R².

Similarly, 554.67^2≈307,659 R².

So T2² + T1²= 307,659 +341,843=649,502 R².

So,

(T2^4 - T1^4)=30 *1139.34 *649,502.

Wait, that's 30 *1139.34=34,180.2.

34,180.2 *649,502= ?

Well, that's 34,180 *649,502.

Wait, that's a big number, but perhaps it's approximately 34,180 *650,000 = ?

34,180 *650,000 = 34,180 *6.5e5 = ?

34,180 *6.5 = 222,170.

So 222,170 *1e5 =2.2217e10.

So (T2^4 - T1^4)=2.2217e10.

Then, σ=0.1714e-8.

So,

q= (0.1714e-8) * (2.2217e10) /1.2222.

Compute numerator: 0.1714e-8 *2.2217e10.

Multiply the coefficients: 0.1714 *2.2217≈0.380.

Multiply the exponents: 1e-8 *1e10=1e2.

So product is 0.380 *1e2=38.0.

Divide by 1.2222: 38.0 /1.2222 ≈31.09 Btu/hr-ft².

Hmm, the options don't have exactly 31.09. So perhaps I made a mistake in my calculation steps.

Let me think again. Alternatively, perhaps the formula is different. Maybe I should have used the formula for two surfaces with emissivity ε:

q = σ ε (T1^4 - T2^4) / (1 - ε)

Wait, no, that's for a single surface emitting to a surrounding. But in this case, it's two surfaces facing each other, so the formula is different.

Wait, another approach: The net heat transfer between two surfaces is given by:

Q = (σ A (T1^4 - T2^4)) / (1/ε1 + 1/ε2 - 1)

Which is what I used before.

But perhaps I made a mistake in the denominator.

Wait, with ε1=ε2=0.9,

Denominator = 1/0.9 + 1/0.9 -1 = (1.1111 +1.1111) -1 =2.2222-1=1.2222.

Yes, that's correct.

So the calculation seems right, leading to around 31 Btu/hr-ft².

Looking at the options, option B is 30.46, which is the closest. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the calculation of (T2^4 - T1^4).

Alternatively, perhaps the emissivity formula is different. Maybe it's (ε1 ε2)/(1 - ε1 ε2 + ε1 + ε2) )

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused about the correct formula here. Maybe I should double-check the formula for radiative heat transfer between two parallel surfaces.

Upon reviewing, the correct formula for the heat flux between two surfaces is:

q = (σ (T1^4 - T2^4)) / ( (1/ε1) + (1/ε2) - 1 )

Which is what I used. So the calculation seems correct.

Wait, but perhaps the temperatures were mixed up. Because in the problem statement, the inner surface is at 95°F and the outer at 125°F. So the
