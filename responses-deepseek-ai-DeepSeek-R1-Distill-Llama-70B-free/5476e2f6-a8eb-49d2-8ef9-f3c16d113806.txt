Question:

You are in your laboratory late one night, working with eight separate containers holding the flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum. Three of the containers hold beetles homozygous for ebony bodies. The remaining five containers hold beetles homozygous for red bodies. Suddenly, the lights in your lab go out. You decide to remove your beetles to another lab so you can continue your work. If you can carry only one container at a time, what is the probability that the first container you select in the darkness contains homozygous ebony beetles and the second container contains homozygous red?

Options:

A: 0.438
B: 0.178
C: 0.358
D: 0.125
E: 0.375
F: 0.268
G: 0.525
H: 0.488
I: 0.225

Okay, so I've got this probability problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand it correctly.

So, the setup is there are eight containers in the lab. Three of them have beetles that are homozygous for ebony bodies, and the remaining five have beetles homozygous for red. The lights go out, and I need to move the beetles. I can carry only one container at a time. The question is asking for the probability that the first container I pick contains homozygous ebony beetles and the second container I pick contains homozygous red.

Hmm. So, I need to calculate the probability of two events happening in sequence: first selecting an ebony container and then a red one.

Let me think about probabilities. Probability is generally the number of favorable outcomes over the total possible outcomes. Since I'm picking without replacement (because I can't carry two containers at the same time, so I must have moved the first before picking the second), each event affects the next.

So, for the first pick, the total number of containers is 8. Out of these, 3 are ebony. So the probability of picking an ebony first is 3/8.

Now, assuming the first pick was ebony, there are now 7 containers left. Because we started with 5 red containers, and we didn't take any red yet, so 5 red and 2 ebony left. So the number of red containers is 5, and total is 7.

So the probability of picking a red container second is 5/7.

To find the combined probability of both events happening in sequence, I multiply the probabilities of each individual event. So that's (3/8) * (5/7).

Let me calculate that. 3 divided by 8 is 0.375, and 5 divided by 7 is approximately 0.7142857. Multiplying them together: 0.375 * 0.7142857.

Let me do the math. 0.375 * 0.7142857 equals... Well, 0.375 is 3/8, and 5/7 is approximately 0.714. So 3 * 5 =15, 8 *7=56. So 15/56. Let me compute that: 15 divided by 56 is approximately 0.26785714.

Wait, let me check that calculation. 56 goes into 15 zero times. 56 goes into 150 two times (2*56=112), subtracting 112 from 150 gives 38. Bring down the next 0: 380. 56*6=336, so 6, which gives 380-336=44. Bring down a zero: 440. 56*7=392, so 7, 440-392=48. Bring down zero: 480. 56*8=448. So subtracting, 480-448=32. Next digit: 56 into 320 is 5 times (5*56=280), remainder 40. Hmm, so the decimal is approximately 0.267857...

Looking at the answer options, option F is 0.268. That's very close to 0.2678, so that must be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in calculating the probabilities. The first pick is 3/8 for ebony. Then, after removing one ebony, there are 2 left, so the remaining for red would indeed be 5 out of 7. So yes, 3/8 times 5/7 is correct.

Another way to look at it: the number of favorable outcomes for the first event is 3, the second is 5. The total number of possible outcomes for the first pick is 8, and for the second pick, 7. So the total number of favorable two-pick sequences is 3 *5 =15. The total possible two-pick sequences are 8 *7 =56. So 15/56 is approximately 0.2678, which is 0.268 when rounded to three decimal places.

Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be option F: 0.268.

The problem involves calculating the probability of selecting a container with homozygous ebony beetles first and then a container with homozygous red beetles, given that there are 8 containers total (3 ebony and 5 red). Since the selection is without replacement, the probabilities for each event depend on the previous outcome.

1. **First selection (ebony):** There are 3 ebony containers out of 8 total, so the probability is:

   \[
   P(\text{ebony first}) = \frac{3}{8}
   \]

2. **Second selection (red):** After removing one ebony container, there are 7 containers left (2 ebony and 5 red). The probability of selecting a red container is:

   \[
   P(\text{red second}) = \frac{5}{7}
   \]

3. **Combined probability:** To find the probability of both events occurring in sequence, multiply the probabilities of each event:

   \[
   P(\text{ebony first and red second}) = \frac{3}{8} \times \frac{5}{7} = \frac{15}{56}
   \]

4. **Numerical calculation:** Converting \(\frac{15}{56}\) to a decimal gives approximately \(0.267857\), which rounds to \(0.268\).

Thus, the probability that the first container selected contains homozygous ebony beetles and the second contains homozygous red beetles is **0.268**.

The correct answer is **F: 0.268**.
