Question:

Discuss Murray's theory of motivation and what influence it had on McClelland's development of the Achievement Motivation model.

Options:

A: McClelland's model was influenced by Hull's theory of survival instincts
B: McClelland's model expanded on Murray's theory by introducing the idea that motivation is primarily driven by social comparison, which wasn't a focus in Murray's work.
C: Murray's theory had no influence on McClelland's model
D: McClelland's model was a direct copy of Murray's ideas
E: McClelland's Achievement Motivation model was influenced by Murray's theory of motivation that human behavior is a reflection of individual needs and motives, and that anything leading to positive affect produces approach behavior and anything leading to negative affect produces avoidance behavior.
F: McClelland's Achievement Motivation model was influenced by Murray's emphasis on psychosocial stages of development, which is not actually a part of Murray's theory.
G: McClelland's model disregarded Murray's focus on individual needs and instead proposed that environmental factors are the only determinants of human motivation.
H: McClelland's model was based on the premise that motivation is solely a product of external rewards and punishments, without any influence from Murray's theory.
I: McClelland's model was influenced by Murray's hierarchy of needs, which is a confusion with Maslow's theory, not Murray's.
J: Murray's theory suggested that motivation is derived from subconscious sexual and aggressive drives, which McClelland incorporated directly into his model.

Okay, so I have this question about Murray's theory of motivation and how it influenced McClelland's Achievement Motivation model. Hmm, I remember reading a bit about these theories before, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me try to think this through.

First, who was Murray? I think he was a psychologist who talked about human needs and motives. His theory probably outlined different needs that drive human behavior. I remember something about needs like achievement, power, and affiliation. Oh right, Murray's theory was about a list of psychogenic needs, like the need for achievement, which McClelland later focused on.

Wait, McClelland's model is the Achievement Motivation theory. From what I recall, he built upon Murray's work. So the question is about how exactly. The options are A through J, so I need to pick the correct influence.

Looking at the options:

Option A says McClelland was influenced by Hull's survival instincts. I don't think that's right because Hull's theory was more about drive reduction, like physiological needs, not the specific achievement motivation.

Option B says McClelland introduced social comparison as a primary motivator, which wasn't in Murray's work. I'm not sure about that. I think Murray's work was more about individual needs rather than comparing with others. But I'm not certain if McClelland focused on social comparison.

Option C claims no influence, which I doubt because I remember McClelland building on Murray's needs, especially the achievement need.

Option D says it's a direct copy, which doesn't sound right. Theories usually expand, not copy directly.

Option E states that McClelland was influenced by Murray's idea that behavior reflects individual needs and that positive affect leads to approach, negative to avoidance. That sounds plausible. Murray did talk about how needs guide behavior towards positive outcomes and away from negative ones.

Option F mentions psychosocial stages, but I think that's Erik Erikson's work, not Murray's. So F is probably incorrect.

Option G says McClelland focused only on environmental factors, ignoring individual needs. No, because McClelland's model is about internal motives like achievement, so G doesn't make sense.

Option H suggests external rewards only, which sounds more like Skinner's operant conditioning, not McClelland's model which is about internal drives.

Option I says McClelland used Murray's hierarchy, but wait, wasn't the hierarchy of needs Maslow's theory? So I might be confusing Murray with Maslow here. So I is probably wrong.

Option J claims Murray's theory was about subconscious sexual and aggressive drives. That sounds more like Freud. Murray's needs were more about various psychogenic needs, not just sexual/aggressive ones, so J is incorrect.

So, going back. The correct option is probably E, because it correctly connects McClelland's model to Murray's emphasis on individual needs and the approach-avoidance based on affect. McClelland took the achievement need from Murray and expanded upon it, talking about how people with a high need for achievement are motivated to succeed because they seek the positive feelings associated with success and avoid the negative feelings of failure.

So, the answer should be E.

E: McClelland's Achievement Motivation model was influenced by Murray's theory of motivation that human behavior is a reflection of individual needs and motives, and that anything leading to positive affect produces approach behavior and anything leading to negative affect produces avoidance behavior.

Answer: E
