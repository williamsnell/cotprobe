Okay, so I've got this question about peak flow meters and what they record. Hmm, I remember that peak flow meters are used in respiratory medicine, probably for conditions like asthma. Let me think about what they measure.

I think peak flow measures how fast a person can exhale air. But wait, is it the average or the peak? Oh right, peak flow is the maximum speed, so it's the highest rate. So it's not an average, but the highest achieved during expiration.

Looking at the options, let me go through them one by one. 

Option A: amount of air inhaled. No, that's more like tidal volume or maybe inspiratory capacity. Peak flow is about exhaling.

Option B: total lung capacity. That's all the air the lungs can hold. But peak flow is about the rate, not the volume. So B isn't right.

Option C: lowest rate of air expelled. No, that doesn't make sense. It should be the highest, not the lowest.

Option D: oxygen saturation. That's measured with a pulse oximeter, not a peak flow meter. So D is out.

Option E: average rate. No, peak is the maximum, not average.

Option F: forced vital capacity. FVC is the total volume exhaled after maximal inhalation. So that's a volume measurement, not a flow rate. So F isn't it.

Option G: volume remaining after forced expiration. That would be residual volume, I think. So not G.

Option H: forced expiratory volume. FEV is a measure, like FEV1 is the volume exhaled in one second. But that's a specific volume over time, not the peak flow rate. So H is different.

Option I: highest rate expelled. Yes, that sounds exactly like what peak flow measures. So I is a contender.

Option J: rate of inhalation. That's more like inspiratory flow rate, but peak flow is about exhaling.

So the correct answer should be I. Wait, what's the difference between forced expiratory volume and peak flow? FEV is volume over time, like liters per second for a specific second. Peak flow is the maximum flow achieved during forced expiration, usually in liters per minute.

So the question is about the highest rate of air expelled, which is option I.

Peak flow meters measure the maximum speed of air exhaled from the lungs, which corresponds to the highest rate of air expelled through an open mouth. This is distinct from other measurements like total lung capacity, oxygen saturation, or average flow rates. Among the options provided, the correct answer is the one that describes the highest rate of air expulsion, which is option I.
