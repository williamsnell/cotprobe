Okay, so I've got this problem about a resistor and energy dissipation. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. The resistor is 4 ohms, and the current through it is given by i(t) = sin(πt). They want the energy dissipated at t=1,2,3,4,5,6 seconds, and E(0) is 0.

Wait, energy dissipated in a resistor... Oh right, the formula for power is P = I² R, and energy is the integral of power over time. So the energy E(t) would be the integral from 0 to t of i(τ)² R dτ.

So first, I need to compute the integral of [sin²(πτ)] * 4 dτ from 0 to each time t.

Wait, the integral of sin²(aτ) dτ. I remember there's a trigonometric identity to simplify sin squared. Oh yeah, sin²(x) = (1 - cos(2x))/2. That should make the integral easier.

Let me rewrite the integrand. So [sin²(πτ)] becomes (1 - cos(2πτ))/2. Then multiply by 4, so the integrand becomes 4*(1 - cos(2πτ))/2 = 2*(1 - cos(2πτ)).

So now the integral from 0 to t of 2*(1 - cos(2πτ)) dτ.

Let's split that into two integrals: 2 times integral of 1 dτ minus 2 times integral of cos(2πτ) dτ, all evaluated from 0 to t.

The first integral of 1 dτ is τ. The second integral is (1/(2π)) sin(2πτ), because the integral of cos(ax) is (1/a) sin(ax). 

Putting it together, the integral becomes 2[τ - (1/(2π)) sin(2πτ)] evaluated from 0 to t.

So evaluating from 0 to t, it's 2[ t - (1/(2π)) sin(2πt) ) ] minus 2[ 0 - (1/(2π)) sin(0) ) ].

But sin(0) is zero, so the second part is zero. So E(t) = 2 [ t - (1/(2π)) sin(2πt) ].

Wait, let me double-check that. Oh wait, no, the integral is 2*(τ - (1/(2π)) sin(2πτ)) from 0 to t. So at t, it's 2*(t - (1/(2π)) sin(2πt)), and at 0, it's 2*(0 - 0) = 0. So yes, E(t) = 2t - (2/(2π)) sin(2πt) = 2t - (1/π) sin(2πt).

Wait, but wait, no—let me recast that correctly. The integral is 2 times [τ - (1/(2π)) sin(2πτ)] evaluated at t minus at 0. So E(t) = 2*(t - (1/(2π)) sin(2πt)) - 2*(0 - 0) ) = 2t - (2*(1/(2π))) sin(2πt) → 2t - (1/π) sin(2πt).

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the algebra. Let's see:

Integral of 2*(1 - cos(2πτ)) dτ = 2 * [ ∫1 dτ - ∫cos(2πτ) dτ ] 

= 2 * [ τ - (1/(2π)) sin(2πτ) ) ] + C.

So yes, when evaluated from 0 to t, it's 2 [ (t - (1/(2π)) sin(2πt)) - (0 - 0) ) ] = 2t - (2*(1/(2π))) sin(2πt) ) = 2t - (1/π) sin(2πt).

Wait, but wait a second! Wait, 2*(1/(2π)) is 1/π. So yes, correct.

So E(t) = 2t - (1/π) sin(2πt).

So now, I need to compute E(t) for t=1,2,3,4,5,6.

But wait, what's sin(2πt) for integer t? Because t is 1,2,3... Let's think. Sin(2π*1) is sin(2π) = 0. Similarly, for any integer t, sin(2πt) is zero because 2πt is a multiple of 2π, and sine of any multiple of 2π is zero. So the second term, (1/π) sin(2πt), becomes zero for integer t.

Therefore, for t=1,2,3,4,5,6, E(t) = 2t - 0 = 2t.

So E(1) = 2(1) = 2 J.

E(2)=4 J.

E(3)=6 J.

E(4)=8 J.

E(5)=10 J.

E(6)=12 J.

Wait, but looking at the options, let's see which one matches. Let's look at the options:

Option E says: E(1)=2J, E(2)=4J, E(3)=6J, E(4)=8J, E(5)=10J, E(6)=12J.

Yes, that's exactly what I got.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's go through the steps again.

The current is i(t) = sin(πt). The power p(t) = i² R = sin²(πt) *4.

Energy is the integral of power from 0 to t.

We applied the identity sin² x = (1 - cos(2x))/2, which gives 4*(1 - cos(2πt))/2 = 2(1 - cos(2πt)).

So the integral becomes ∫0^t 2(1 - cos(2πτ)) dτ = 2 [ τ - (1/(2π)) sin(2πτ) ] from 0 to t.

At τ = t, it's 2 [ t - (1/(2π)) sin(2πt) ].

At τ=0, it's 2 [0 - 0 ]=0.

So E(t) = 2t - (1/π) sin(2πt).

But when t is integer, sin(2πt) = 0, so E(t) = 2t.

Thus, the energy values are 2,4,6,8,10,12 Joules for t=1 to 6.

Looking at the options, option E matches exactly.

To determine the energy dissipated in the resistor at specific times, we start with the current \( i(t) = \sin(\pi t) \) and the resistor value \( R = 4 \, \Omega \). The power dissipated in the resistor is given by \( p(t) = i^2(t) R \), and the energy dissipated is the integral of power over time:

\[
E(t) = \int_0^t p(\tau) \, d\tau = \int_0^t \sin^2(\pi \tau) \cdot 4 \, d\tau.
\]

Using the trigonometric identity \( \sin^2(x) = \frac{1 - \cos(2x)}{2} \), the integrand becomes:

\[
\sin^2(\pi \tau) \cdot 4 = 4 \cdot \frac{1 - \cos(2\pi \tau)}{2} = 2 \cdot (1 - \cos(2\pi \tau)).
\]

Thus, the energy becomes:

\[
E(t) = \int_0^t 2 \cdot (1 - \cos(2\pi \tau)) \, d\tau.
\]

Splitting the integral:

\[
E(t) = 2 \int_0^t 1 \, d\tau - 2 \int_0^t \cos(2\pi \tau) \, d\tau.
\]

The first term evaluates to \( 2t \), and the second term involves the integral of \( \cos(2\pi \tau) \), which is \( \frac{\sin(2\pi \tau)}{2\pi} \). Therefore:

\[
E(t) = 2t - \frac{2}{2\pi} \sin(2\pi t) = 2t - \frac{1}{\pi} \sin(2\pi t).
\]

For integer values of \( t \), \( \sin(2\pi t) = 0 \), so the energy simplifies to:

\[
E(t) = 2t.
\]

Now, calculating \( E(t) \) for \( t = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \):

\[
\begin{aligned}
E(1) &= 2(1) = 2 \, \text{J}, \\
E(2) &= 2(2) = 4 \, \text{J}, \\
E(3) &= 2(3) = 6 \, \text{J}, \\
E(4) &= 2(4) = 8 \, \text{J}, \\
E(5) &= 2(5) = 10 \, \text{J}, \\
E(6) &= 2(6) = 12 \, \text{J}.
\end{aligned}
\]

Comparing these results with the options provided, the correct choice is:

**E: \( E(1) = 2 \, \text{J}, E(2) = 4 \, \text{J}, E(3) = 6 \, \text{J}, E(4) = 8 \, \text{J}, E(5) = 10 \, \text{J}, E(6) = 12 \, \text{J} \).**
