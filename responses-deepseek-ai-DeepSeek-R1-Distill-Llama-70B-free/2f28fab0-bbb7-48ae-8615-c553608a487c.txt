Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about holidays and their dates. I need to figure out which holiday isn't tied to a specific date. Let me think through each option one by one.

First, I'll list out all the options:

A: Thanksgiving
B: Memorial Day
C: Valentine's Day
D: Independence Day
E: New Year's Day
F: Halloween
G: Easter
H: Christmas
I: Labor Day
J: St. Patrick's Day

I need to remember which of these have fixed dates and which don't. Let's go through each.

A: Thanksgiving. I think in the US, Thanksgiving is on the fourth Thursday of November every year. So the date changes each year but it's always that Thursday.

B: Memorial Day. That's the last Monday in May. So again, the exact date changes, but it's the same day of the week each year.

C: Valentine's Day. That's always February 14th, right? So fixed date.

D: Independence Day. July 4th, definitely a fixed date.

E: New Year's Day. January 1st, fixed.

F: Halloween. October 31st, so fixed.

G: Easter. Hmm, Easter is a bit tricky. I remember it's a moveable feast because it's based on the lunar calendar. It's the first Sunday after the full moon following the vernal equinox. So the date varies each year, not fixed.

H: Christmas. December 25th every year, fixed.

I: Labor Day. First Monday in September, so the date changes but it's the same day of the week.

J: St. Patrick's Day. That's March 17th, fixed.

So the question is asking which is not attached to a specific date. So the ones that don't have a fixed date are A, B, G, and I. Wait, but the question is which one is NOT attached, so looking for a holiday that doesn't have a fixed date.

Wait, the options are A to J, and the question is which is not attached to a specific date. So the correct answer would be the one whose date varies, like Easter.

Looking back, G is Easter. So the answer should be G.

The correct answer is G: Easter, as it is a moveable feast and not tied to a specific date.

G
