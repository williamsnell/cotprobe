Okay, so I have this question about Peter Singer's main argument, specifically the second premise. The premise is: "If it is in your power to prevent something bad from happening, without sacrificing anything nearly as important, it is wrong not to do so." The question is asking which phrase in this premise is deliberately left vague. The options are from A to J, each corresponding to a part of the sentence.

Hmm, I remember that Singer's argument is about our moral obligation to help others, like in his famous "drowning child" analogy. The second premise here seems to outline a duty based on our ability to prevent harm without significant sacrifice.

So the question is about which part is vague. Vagueness in philosophical premises often leaves room for interpretation, which can be important for applying the principle in various situations. Let me break down the sentence.

Looking at each option:

A: "it is in" – Not sure, seems more like a grammatical part.
B: "in your power" – This could be a point. What exactly constitutes being within one's power? It's a bit subjective, but I'm not certain if this is the most vague part.
C: "prevent" – The word prevent is clear in meaning, I think.
D: "If it is" – Again, grammatical, part of the condition.
E: "it is wrong" – This is a moral judgment, but the premise is stating it as a given, not vague.
F: "not to do so" – Seems clear, just the negation of the action.
G: "nearly as important" – This phrase stands out. What counts as 'nearly as important'? It's a comparison, but without specific criteria, it's quite vague. Different people might have different opinions on what's important enough.
H: "from happening" – Clear, part of the action.
I: "something bad" – This is a bit vague. 'Bad' can vary widely. But wait, the question is about which is deliberately left vague. I think 'something bad' is indeed vague, but let me think deeper.
J: "without sacrificing" – This is about the cost, but the next part is 'anything nearly as important', which ties into option G.

So the premise is setting up a condition where if you can prevent something bad without sacrificing something nearly as important, then it's wrong not to act. The key vague part here is 'nearly as important' because it's a relative term. What one person finds important might differ from another, and there's no clear measure provided. It leaves room for debate and application in various contexts.

Wait, but option I is 'something bad'. That's also vague. So which one is it? The premise says "something bad", which is a general term. But Singer's argument might rely on the idea that we can recognize bad things when we see them, even if the term is a bit broad. The more critical vague part is probably the 'nearly as important' because it's a comparative and leaves the extent of sacrifice open.

So between G and I. The question is about the second premise. Let me recall Singer's work. The premise is more about the balance between the sacrifice and the importance. So the phrase "nearly as important" is the part that's left vague because it doesn't specify how much importance is considered 'nearly as'—it's relative and context-dependent.

The second premise in Singer's argument is: "If it is in your power to prevent something bad from happening, without sacrificing anything nearly as important, it is wrong not to do so." The phrase deliberately left vague is "nearly as important." This phrase is subjective and context-dependent, as it does not provide specific criteria for determining what qualifies as "nearly as important." Its vagueness allows for interpretation and application in various situations.

Answer: G
