Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about the just-noticeable difference, or JND. I'm a bit rusty on my psychology, but I'll try to think it through step by step.

The question is asking what the detection of a JND depends on. The options are A to D. Let me try to remember what JND is all about. From what I recall, JND is the smallest difference in a stimulus that a person can detect. Like, if you have a certain weight, the JND would be the minimal amount you can add or remove and still notice the difference.

Wait, but I think there's a difference between absolute threshold and difference threshold. Absolute threshold is the minimum intensity where a stimulus can be detected, like the faintest sound you can hear. Difference threshold, which I think is the same as JND, is the smallest change in a stimulus that a person can notice. So when you already have a stimulus, how much do you need to change it before someone notices.

So the question is about detecting a JND. I think that detecting a JND depends on the intensity of the original stimulus and the change. Like, if you have a light, the JND would be how much brighter or dimmer it needs to be for someone to notice. So it's about comparing the new stimulus to the existing one.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Presence of a "no stimulus" control and the sensitivity of the equipment. Hmm, not sure. I thought JND is more about the subject's perception than the equipment. Plus, "no stimulus" control might relate to absolute threshold, not difference.

Option B: Initial determination of absolute threshold and variation of difference threshold. Wait, no. Absolute threshold is a separate concept. JND is about the difference, so maybe this isn't right. Or maybe it's related, but I think the main factor is the current stimulus's intensity.

Option C: Frequency of the existing stimulus and presence of other sensory modalities. Frequency might matter, but I don't think it's the main factor for JND. Also, other sensory modalities don't directly impact the JND of the stimulus in question. Like, if you're focusing on hearing, having another sense (like touch) might not affect it much.

Option D: Intensity of the new stimulus and that of the already present. This sounds right. Because JND is the difference between two stimuli. So you have an existing stimulus, and the new one is just enough different to be noticed.

Wait, but wait. I remember something about Weber's Law. It states that the JND is proportional to the intensity of the original stimulus. So the bigger the original stimulus, the bigger the JND. Like, if you have a certain weight, the JND is a percentage of that weight. So for example, if you can lift 10kg, the JND might be 0.5kg, so you need to add at least that to notice. But if it's 20kg, the JND would be 1kg. So the ratio is constant.

So Weber's law says JND is a function of the original stimulus's intensity. So when you have a new stimulus (let's say, a slightly different weight), you can detect the difference based on the original's intensity. So the detection of JND depends on the intensity of both the new and the existing stimulus.

So looking back at the options, option D says the intensity of the new and the existing. That makes sense.

But wait, what about option B? It says initial absolute threshold and variation of the difference threshold. Hmm. No, because absolute threshold is about detecting presence vs absence, not the difference. So I think B is wrong.

So the correct answer should be D.

The just-noticeable difference (JND) refers to the smallest change in a stimulus that a person can detect. It is closely related to Weber's Law, which states that the JND is proportional to the intensity of the original stimulus. This means that the ability to detect a JND depends on comparing the intensity of the new stimulus to the intensity of the existing stimulus. 

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** mentions a "no stimulus" control and equipment sensitivity, which is more relevant to absolute threshold (detecting the presence or absence of a stimulus) rather than JND.
- **Option B** refers to absolute threshold and variation of difference threshold, but JND focuses on the difference between stimuli, not the absolute detection of a stimulus.
- **Option C** discusses frequency and sensory modalities, which are not central to the detection of JND.
- **Option D** correctly identifies that JND depends on the intensity of the new stimulus and the intensity of the already present stimulus, aligning with Weber's Law.

Thus, the detection of a JND is best explained by Option D.
