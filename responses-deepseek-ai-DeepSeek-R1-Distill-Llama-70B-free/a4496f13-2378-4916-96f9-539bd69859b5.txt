Okay, so I've got this problem about a flywheel's rotational kinetic energy. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me try to work through it step by step.

Alright, the flywheel has a mass of 30 kg, right? And the radius of gyration is 2 meters. Oh wait, radius of gyration... that's the measure of how the mass is distributed relative to the axis of rotation. So it's like the equivalent distance of the mass from the center, I think.

The flywheel is turning at 2.4 revolutions per second. I remember that rotational kinetic energy depends on the moment of inertia and the angular velocity. The formula, I think, is KE = ½ I ω². Right, because it's similar to linear kinetic energy (½ mv²), but for rotation.

So first, I need to find the moment of inertia (I). The formula for the moment of inertia when given the radius of gyration (k) is I = m * k². Oh yeah, because for some objects, like a solid cylinder, the radius of gyration is related to the radius. But here, since the radius of gyration is given directly, I can use I = m*k².

Plugging the numbers in: I = 30 kg * (2 m)². So 2 squared is 4, 30 times 4 is 120 kg·m². Got that.

Next, I need the angular velocity (ω) in radians per second. The problem gives it in revolutions per second. I remember that 1 revolution is 2π radians. So 2.4 rev/sec is 2.4 * 2π rad/s. Let me calculate that: 2.4 times 2 is 4.8, so 4.8π rad/s. Alternatively, 4.8π is approximately 15.0796 rad/s, but maybe I'll keep it symbolic for exactness until the end.

Now, plug everything into the KE formula. KE = ½ * I * ω². Substituting the numbers: ½ * 120 * (4.8π)². Let me compute each part step by step.

First, (4.8π) squared. Let's compute that: (4.8)^2 is 23.04, and π squared is π², so (4.8π)^2 = 23.04 * π².

Alternatively, 4.8 * 4.8 is 23.04, so (4.8π)^2 = 23.04 * π².

So now, KE = 0.5 * 120 * 23.04 * π².

Let me compute 0.5 * 120 first. That's 60. So now it's 60 * 23.04 * π².

60 times 23.04 is... let's see. 60 * 20 is 1200, 60 * 3.04 is 182.4. So 1200 + 182.4 is 1382.4. So 60 * 23.04 = 1382.4.

So now, KE = 1382.4 * π².

Wait, wait, no, wait. Wait a second, because I think I might have made a mistake there. Let me double-check. 4.8 is the revolutions per second converted to rad/s? No, wait, original calculation: 2.4 rev/s times 2π is 4.8π rad/s. So that's correct. So (4.8π)^2 is 23.04 * π². So then, ½ * 120 is 60, correct. 60 * 23.04 is 1382.4, yes. So 1382.4 * π².

Wait, but wait another thing. Oh wait, no, because (4.8π)^2 is 23.04 * π². So when I multiply all the factors, it's 60 * (23.04 * π²) = 60 * 23.04 * π². So that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the numerical value instead of carrying π². Maybe that's easier for getting the exact number.

Let me compute π as approximately 3.1416. So π squared is about 9.8696.

So 23.04 * 9.8696 = let's calculate that. 23 * 9.8696 is approximately 227. so, 23 * 9.8696: 20*9.8696=197.392, 3*9.8696=29.6088; sum is 197.392 +29.6088=226.999, approximately 227. Then, 0.04 *9.8696 is about 0.3948. So total is 227 +0.3948=227.3948. So approximately 227.3948.

So now, 60 * 227.3948 = let's compute that. 60 * 200 =12,000; 60 *27.3948= 1,643.688. Adding them together: 12,000 +1,643.688 = 13,643.688 Joules.

Wait, but let me check the options. Looking back at the options given:

A: 15432.98
B:16789.45
C:10321.56
D:9000
E:14832.12
F:11075.88
G:13643.74
H:12233.22
I:12500
J:20000.

So my approximate calculation gives me around 13,643.688, which matches option G:13643.74. Hmm, but wait, let me double-check calculations for any possible errors.

Wait, perhaps I messed up a step. Let me go back.

Let me recompute (4.8π)^2:

4.8 squared is 23.04, and π squared is about 9.8696. So 23.04 * 9.8696 = let me compute more accurately.

23.04 * 9.8696.

Let me compute 23 * 9.8696 = 227. so 23 *9.8696= 227.0008. Then, 0.04 *9.8696= 0.394784. So total is 227.0008 + 0.394784= 227.395584.

Then, 60 * 227.395584 = 13,643.735 J. Which is approximately 13,643.74, which is option G.

But wait, let me think again. Because another approach would be to compute ω squared as (2.4 rev/s converted to rad/s)^2, and then compute I.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the moment of inertia correctly. I = m * k². m=30 kg, k=2 m. So I = 30 * 4 = 120 kg·m². That's correct.

ω is 2.4 rev/s. Each rev is 2π rad, so ω = 2.4 * 2π = 4.8π rad/s. Squared is (4.8π)^2 = 23.04 π².

So KE = 0.5 * I * ω² = 0.5 * 120 * 23.04 π².

0.5 *120 is 60. 60 *23.04 is 1382.4. Then multiplied by π².

Wait, wait, perhaps I can compute 1382.4 * π². So π² is ~9.8696. 1382.4 *9.8696.

Let me compute that:

1382.4 *9.8696.

Let me break it down:

1382.4 * 9 = 12441.6

1382.4 * 0.8 = 1105.92

1382.4 *0.0696 = Let's compute 1382.4 * 0.07 = approx 96.768. But more accurately, 0.0696 is 0.07 - 0.0004.

So 1382.4 *0.07 = 96.768

1382.4 *0.0004 = 0.55296

So subtracting: 96.768 -0.55296=96.21504.

Now sum all the parts: 12441.6 + 1105.92 = 13547.52 +96.21504 = 13643.735 J, which is ~13643.74 J. So option G.

But wait, let me think again. Did I make any mistake in the calculation steps?

Another approach: use all variables step by step.

1. I = m * k² = 30 kg * (2 m)^2 = 30 *4 =120 kg·m².

2. ω = 2.4 rev/s * 2π rad/rev = 4.8π rad/s.

3. KE = ½ * I * ω² = 0.5 *120 * (4.8π)^2.

Compute (4.8π)^2:

4.8^2=23.04.

π^2=9.8696.

So 23.04 *9.8696 = 227.395584.

Now, 0.5*120=60.

60 *227.395584= 60 *227.395584.

60 * 227 = 13620.

60 * 0.395584=23.73504.

Total: 13620 +23.73504 =13643.735 Joules. So about 13643.74 J, which is option G.

So I think the correct answer is G.

To calculate the rotational kinetic energy of the flywheel, we use the formula:

\[
KE = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2
\]

### Step 1: Determine the moment of inertia
The moment of inertia \(I\) is given by \(I = m k^2\), where \(m\) is the mass and \(k\) is the radius of gyration. Substituting the given values:

\[
I = 30 \, \text{kg} \times (2 \, \text{m})^2 = 30 \times 4 = 120 \, \text{kg·m}^2
\]

### Step 2: Convert angular velocity to radians per second
The flywheel's rotational speed is \(2.4 \, \text{rev/s}\). Since \(1 \, \text{rev} = 2\pi \, \text{rad}\), the angular velocity \(\omega\) in radians per second is:

\[
\omega = 2.4 \times 2\pi = 4.8\pi \, \text{rad/s}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \(\omega^2\)
Squaring the angular velocity:

\[
\omega^2 = (4.8\pi)^2 = (4.8)^2 \times \pi^2 = 23.04 \times \pi^2
\]

Using \(\pi^2 \approx 9.8696\):

\[
\omega^2 = 23.04 \times 9.8696 \approx 227.3956 \, \text{rad}^2/\text{s}^2
\]

### Step 4: Compute the rotational kinetic energy
Substitute \(I = 120 \, \text{kg·m}^2\) and \(\omega^2 = 227.3956 \, \text{rad}^2/\text{s}^2\) into the formula for \(KE\):

\[
KE = \frac{1}{2} \times 120 \times 227.3956
\]

First, calculate \(\frac{1}{2} \times 120\):

\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 120 = 60
\]

Now multiply by \(\omega^2\):

\[
KE = 60 \times 227.3956 \approx 13643.74 \, \text{J}
\]

### Final Answer
The rotational kinetic energy of the flywheel is approximately **13,643.74 Joules**, which corresponds to option **G**.
