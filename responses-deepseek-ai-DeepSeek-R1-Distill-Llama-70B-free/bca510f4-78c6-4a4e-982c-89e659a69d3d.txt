Okay, so I've got this question about earnings per share, and I'm a bit new to this, but I'll try to work through it step by step. Let's see what the question says.

Velco Corporation shows a profit to common shareholders of $5,250. They have 1,250 shares outstanding. I need to find the earnings per share. The options are from A to J, and I have to pick the right one.

Hmm, I remember that earnings per share (EPS) is a common metric used in finance. It tells you how much profit a company makes for each share of stock. The formula, if I recall correctly, is EPS equals net income divided by the number of shares outstanding. But wait, I should make sure I'm using the right values here.

The question mentions profit to common shareholders, which I think is the same as net income available to common shareholders. So that's the numerator in the equation. So the net income here is $5,250.

The denominator is the number of shares outstanding. It says 1,250 shares. So I just divide 5,250 by 1,250. Let me do that calculation.

Let me write it out: 5,250 รท 1,250. Let me think, 1,250 times 4 is 5,000. So 5,250 minus 5,000 is 250. So that's 4 and then 250/1,250. 250 is one-fifth of 1,250, so 0.2. So 4.2. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see a 4.2 immediately. Let me check the options again.

Options are A:6, B:4, C:5.25, D:5, E:2.5, F:3.5, G:4.5, H:3, I:7, J:4.2. Oh, there is a J:4.20. So that's the answer. But wait, wait a second. Did I do the calculation right?

Wait, another way to think about it: 1,250 times 4 is 5,000. 5,250 is 250 more. 250 divided by 1,250 is 0.2. So 4.2 total. So the EPS is $4.20 per share, which matches option J.

But wait, sometimes companies have preferred stock. Oh wait, the question says profit to common shareholders, so I think that's after any preferred dividends have been subtracted. So the net income I'm using is correct because it's the profit going to common shareholders. So the calculation should be correct.

So the answer should be J: $4.20.

To calculate Velco Corporation's earnings per share (EPS), we use the formula:

\[
\text{EPS} = \frac{\text{Net Income to Common Shareholders}}{\text{Number of Shares Outstanding}}
\]

From the question:
- Net Income to Common Shareholders = $5,250
- Number of Shares Outstanding = 1,250

Performing the calculation:

\[
\text{EPS} = \frac{5,250}{1,250} = 4.20
\]

Thus, Velco's earnings per share is $4.20, which corresponds to option J.
