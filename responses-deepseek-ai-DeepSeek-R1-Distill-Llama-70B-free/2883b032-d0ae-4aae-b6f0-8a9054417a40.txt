Answer:
    <think>
<think>
Okay, so I've got this question about Berkeley and his views on heat and cold. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on philosophy, but I'll try to think it through.

I remember that Berkeley was an idealist, right? He believed that things like objects and qualities don't exist independently of perception. So, for him, everything is about perception and the mind.

Wait, the question is specifically about heat and cold. I think Berkeley argued that these are sensations. Like, when we feel heat or cold, it's not that the objects themselves have these qualities inherently, but rather that our minds perceive them as such.

So, looking at the options:

Option C says "only sensations existing in our minds." That sounds right because Berkeley would say that heat and cold are just our subjective experiences, not properties of the physical world existing on their own.

Option A says they're elements of nature that don't exist independently. That's a bit confusing. I think Berkeley would say they don't exist outside the mind, so maybe that's related, but the phrasing isn't as precise as option C.

Option F is about sensations existing outside our minds. No, that's the opposite of what Berkeley thought. He believed they exist only in the mind.

Option I mentions types of energy. I don't think that's right because energy is a physical concept, and Berkeley would see heat and cold as mental experiences.

So, putting it all together, I think the correct answer is C.

Berkeley, an idealist philosopher, argued that heat and cold are not independent physical properties but are instead sensations that exist solely in the mind. This aligns with option C, which states that they are "only sensations existing in our minds."

Answer: C
