Question:

Solve the equation −6x = −36. Check your answer.

Options:

A: 42
B: 30
C: -42
D: -36
E: 1 over 216
F: 216
G: 1 over 6
H: 0
I: -6
J: 6

Answer:
    <think>


To solve the equation \(-6x = -36\), follow these steps:

1. **Isolate the variable \(x\):**
   To isolate \(x\), divide both sides of the equation by \(-6\):
   \[
   x = \frac{-36}{-6}
   \]

2. **Simplify the equation:**
   When you divide two negative numbers, the result is positive:
   \[
   x = 6
   \]

3. **Verify the solution:**
   Substitute \(x = 6\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   -6(6) = -36
   \]
   \[
   -36 = -36 \quad \text{(True)}
   \]

Thus, the solution to the equation is \(x = 6\).

From the given options, the correct answer is **J: 6**.
