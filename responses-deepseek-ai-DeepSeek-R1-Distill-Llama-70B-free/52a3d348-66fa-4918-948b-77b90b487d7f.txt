Alright, I'm trying to figure out the answer to this multiple-choice question about the Treaty of Versailles. Let me start by recalling what I know about the Treaty and its reception in the United States.

The Treaty of Versailles was signed in 1919, ending World War I. It's famous for the War Guilt Clause, which placed blame on Germany, and for the establishment of the League of Nations, which was Woodrow Wilson's idea for maintaining international peace. But I remember that the US Senate didn't ratify the treaty. Why was that?

I think there were several reasons, but the main one was opposition to the League of Nations. Some senators were against the US joining the League because they feared it would lead to increased American involvement in European affairs. They wanted to maintain US isolationism. So, the Senate didn't approve the treaty because of disagreements over the League's provisions.

Now, looking at the options provided:

Option A: The US Senate approved it without any reservations. No, that's incorrect because I remember the Senate did reject it.

Option B: Rejected because it treated Germany too leniently. I don't think so. The treaty was actually pretty harsh on Germany, which led to resentment and contributed to WWII. So this doesn't fit.

Option C: Rejected because it required increased American involvement. Yes, this rings a bell. Opponents, especially Republicans like Henry Cabot Lodge, didn't want the US to be bound by the League's decisions, fearing it would drag the US into more European conflicts.

Option D: Approved with reservations on the League. Wait, no. The Senate didn't approve it at all. They had reservations, but the treaty wasn't approved because of those. So D is incorrect.

Option E: Approved because decreased involvement. No, the opposite happened. The treaty might have required more involvement through the League.

Option F: Approved with reservations on Eastern Europe. Again, the main issue was the League, not Eastern Europe divisions, so F isn't right.

Option G: Voted down because no impartial neutrality. That doesn't make sense. The quote in the question was from Wilson's neutrality declaration before the US entered WWI, not related to the Treaty's content.

Option H: Unanimous approval. No, definitely not, since it was controversial.

Option I: Rejected because it didn't address neutrality. I don't think neutrality was the issue. The focus was on the League and US involvement.

Option J: Never voted on. No, I'm pretty sure it was voted on and failed to pass.

So the correct answer seems to be Option C: The United States Senate rejected it because it required increased American involvement in European affairs.

The correct answer is C. The United States Senate rejected the Treaty of Versailles primarily due to concerns that it would require increased American involvement in European affairs, particularly through the League of Nations, which many senators opposed.

Answer: C
