Question:

One year ago, while driving through an intersection, the defendant's car collided with the plaintiff's car. The plaintiff sued, claiming that the defendant ran a red light. In her case-in-chief, the plaintiff testified that immediately after the accident, a bystander, who was a local resident, screamed at the defendant, "You jerk. . . you drove through the red light. " In his case-in-chief, the defendant now calls a police accident investigator to testify that the plaintiff told him that she "didn't see the color of the light when she entered the intersection because she was dialing a number on her cell phone. "The investigator's testimony should be

Options:

A: admitted, because the plaintiff's statement to the investigator is a prior inconsistent statement.
B: excluded, because the plaintiff's statement to the investigator is hearsay.
C: admitted, because the plaintiff's cell phone use is relevant to the issue of negligence.
D: excluded, because the investigator's testimony is second-hand information and therefore unreliable.
E: admitted, because the accident investigator gathered the information in the course of his official duties.
F: admitted, because the plaintiff's inconsistent statement has bearing on her credibility.
G: admitted, because it is a statement against interest and therefore an exception to the hearsay rule.
H: excluded, because the statement was not made under oath and therefore may not be truthful.
I: excluded, because the defendant did not have the opportunity to cross-examine the plaintiff at the time she made the statement.

Okay, so I've got this evidence question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's going on.

So, the scenario is about a car accident that happened a year ago. The defendant and plaintiff collided at an intersection. The plaintiff sued, saying the defendant ran a red light. In her case, the plaintiff testified that right after the accident, a bystander yelled at the defendant, "You jerk... you drove through the red light." Now, the defendant is presenting his case and wants to call a police accident investigator to testify. The investigator will say that the plaintiff told him she didn't see the color of the light because she was on her cell phone.

The question is about whether this investigator's testimony should be admitted or excluded, and why.

Hmm. So the options are A through J. Let's break this down.

First, I remember that hearsay is a big issue here. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. So the plaintiff's statement to the investigator is being offered to show she didn't see the light, which would undermine her claim that the defendant ran a red light.

But wait, the plaintiff made this statement to the investigator during the investigation. So is that hearsay? Well, if the statement is being offered for the truth (that she didn't see the light), then yes, it's hearsay. But there are exceptions.

I also recall that prior inconsistent statements can sometimes be used. But wait, prior inconsistent statements are admissible if they were made under oath, like in a deposition or previous testimony. Here, the plaintiff's statement to the investigator wasn't under oath, so maybe it doesn't qualify as a prior inconsistent statement exception.

Alternatively, could it be admissible under another hearsay exception? For example, statements against interest. But the plaintiff's statement here is about her own conduct—dialing a number on her cell phone. That could be relevant to her negligence. Wait, but is it against her interest? If she was on the phone, maybe that means she was distracted, contributing to the accident. So maybe her statement is against her interest because it could show she was negligent, making her partially or fully responsible.

Wait, but the statement against interest exception applies when the declarant's statement is so against their interest at the time it was made that a reasonable person would make it only if they believed it was true. So if the plaintiff said she was dialing and didn't see the light, that could subject her to liability, so it's against her interest. That might make it admissible under that exception.

But another angle: the defendant is using the statement to impeach the plaintiff's credibility. The plaintiff testified that the bystander said the defendant ran the red light, implying she might have seen or at least believed the defendant was at fault. But her statement to the investigator suggests she wasn't paying attention, which could affect her credibility as a witness. So maybe it's admissible for impeachment purposes.

Wait, but impeachment via prior inconsistent statements usually requires that the statement was made under oath. Since this was a statement to an investigator, not under oath, it wouldn't qualify as a prior inconsistent statement for impeachment. Unless... wait, maybe under the FRE, there's another way.

Alternatively, could it be non-hearsay? Because if the statement is offered not for the truth, but just to show that she made the statement, maybe for some other purpose. But in this case, the defendant is offering it to show that she didn't see the light, so it's for the truth, which brings it back to hearsay.

So if it's hearsay and no exception applies, it's inadmissible. But if it falls under an exception, like statement against interest, then it's admissible.

Wait, the plaintiff's statement is about her own conduct, which could subject her to civil liability. So that would make it a statement against interest. Therefore, under FRE 804(b)(3), it's admissible as an exception to hearsay.

Wait, but the statement is being used by the defendant against the plaintiff. The plaintiff is the declarant. So the statement is against her interest because it suggests she was negligent, which would affect her claim. So yes, it's a statement against interest.

So the options are looking at this. Let's check the options:

Option A: Admitted as prior inconsistent statement. But prior inconsistent statements not under oath aren't admissible as substantive evidence, only for impeachment if the witness is given a chance to explain, but here it's the defendant's case, so maybe not.

Option B: Excluded as hearsay. But if it's a statement against interest, it wouldn't be excluded.

Option C: Admitted because her cell phone use is relevant to negligence. That's true, but the issue is whether it's hearsay.

Option F: Admitted because the inconsistent statement affects credibility. But again, prior inconsistent statements not under oath can't be used substantively, only for impeachment if the proper foundation is laid. But in this case, the defendant is offering it in his case, so maybe it's allowed.

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

The key is whether the statement is hearsay. If it is, but falls under an exception, it's admissible.

The statement by the plaintiff to the investigator is offered for the truth—that she didn't see the light. So it's hearsay. Now, is there an exception?

Statement against interest: FRE 804(b)(3). The statement must be against the declarant's interest at the time it was made. Here, the plaintiff's admission that she was on her phone and didn't see the light could be against her interest because it suggests she was negligent, which would impact her lawsuit. So yes, it's a statement against interest.

Therefore, it's admissible under that exception. So the answer would be G.

Wait, but another thought: the plaintiff is the party opponent here. So under the rule, statements offered by a party against an opposing party can sometimes be admissible under the admission by a party exception. Wait, is this a statement by the plaintiff, who is a party, so it's an admission by a party opponent. So under FRE 801(d)(2), a statement is not hearsay if it's offered against a party and was made by the party's agent or the party himself. So the plaintiff's own statement is an admission by a party opponent, so it's not hearsay at all.

Oh, wait! I think I complicated it with the statement against interest, but actually, it's simpler. The plaintiff's own statement is an admission by a party opponent, so it's non-hearsay. So it doesn't need an exception. Therefore, the testimony should be admitted because it's not hearsay.

But wait, let me confirm. FRE 801(d)(2)(A) says that a statement is not hearsay if it is the opposing party's statement. So the plaintiff's statement to the investigator is her own statement, so it's an admission by a party opponent. Therefore, it's admissible as non-hearsay.

So in that case, the correct option would be A, which says it's admitted as a prior inconsistent statement, but wait, no—because prior inconsistent statements are only admissible as non-hearsay if they were made under oath. But here, the statement to the investigator wasn't under oath. So if it's an admission by a party opponent, it's non-hearsay regardless.

So looking at the options, option A says it's a prior inconsistent statement. But that's not the correct reasoning because prior inconsistent statements not under oath are only usable for impeachment, not as substantive evidence. But if it's an admission, it's substantive evidence.

Wait, so the correct reasoning would be that it's an admission by a party opponent, making it non-hearsay. So which option aligns with that?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Admitted as prior inconsistent statement. But that's not correct because prior inconsistent statements not under oath can't be used substantively.

Option F: Admitted because it's inconsistent and bears on credibility. But again, that's impeachment, not substantive.

Option C: Admitted because cell phone use is relevant. That's about relevance, but doesn't address hearsay.

Option G: Admitted as statement against interest. But if it's an admission by a party opponent, it's non-hearsay, making G incorrect.

So the correct answer would be that the statement is an admission by a party opponent, so it's not hearsay. Looking at the options, I don't see an option that explicitly says that. Wait, let me check the options again.

Option A: Prior inconsistent statement. Not correct because of the oath issue.

Option B: Excluded as hearsay. No, because it's an admission.

Option C: Admitted because relevant to negligence. Correct in result, but the reasoning is about hearsay.

Wait, maybe none of the options state it's an admission. Let me read the options again.

Ah, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the options:

Option A: admitted, prior inconsistent statement. But prior inconsistent statements not under oath are only for impeachment, not as substantive evidence. So in the defendant's case-in-chief, using it as substantive evidence would require it to be non-hearsay.

Option F: admitted because bearing on credibility. That's about impeachment, which would only allow the statement to attack her credibility, not as substantive evidence. But the defendant is using it to show she didn't see the light, which is substantive.

So, perhaps the better approach is to realize that the statement is non-hearsay because it's an admission by a party opponent. But looking at the options, perhaps option C is the closest, but it's about relevance, not hearsay.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is A. Because the plaintiff's statement is a prior inconsistent statement, but I thought prior inconsistent statements must be under oath. Wait, no—prior inconsistent statements are admissible as substantive evidence only if they were made under oath. Since this wasn't under oath, it can't be used as a prior inconsistent statement for substantive purposes. So option A would be incorrect.

Therefore, the correct reasoning is that the statement is an admission by a party opponent, making it non-hearsay. But none of the options directly address that. Wait, perhaps option F is about credibility, but that's impeachment, not substantive.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. The plaintiff made a statement to the investigator that she didn't see the light. The defendant wants to offer this statement through the investigator.

The statement is an admission by a party opponent, so it's non-hearsay. Therefore, it's admissible. So which option says that? Looking at the options, none explicitly say that. So perhaps the answer is C: admitted because cell phone use is relevant. But that's not addressing the hearsay issue.

Wait, perhaps the statement is non-hearsay, so the correct option is A, B, C, etc. Let me see.

Option G says it's a statement against interest. But if it's an admission by a party opponent, it's non-hearsay, so G isn't the right reasoning.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to approach this differently.

The defendant is calling the investigator to testify about what the plaintiff said. The plaintiff's statement is being offered to prove that she didn't see the light, which would mean she can't reliably claim the defendant ran a red light.

This is hearsay unless an exception applies. The possible exceptions are:

1. Admission by a party opponent (FRE 801(d)(2)): Yes, because the plaintiff is the opposing party, and this is her own statement. Therefore, it's non-hearsay.

So the testimony should be admitted because it's non-hearsay. So which option matches that?

Looking at the options:

Option A: Prior inconsistent statement. Incorrect reasoning.

Option B: Excluded as hearsay. No, because it's non-hearsay.

Option C: Admitted, relevant to negligence. Correct in result, but doesn't address hearsay.

Option F: Admitted because bearing on credibility. That's impeachment, but the statement is being used substantively.

So perhaps the best option is C, but I'm not sure because the key issue is hearsay.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is F because it's about credibility, but that would be impeachment, which doesn't allow substantive use.

Wait, but if it's non-hearsay, then it's admissible for its truth, regardless of other considerations. So the correct answer should be that it's admitted because it's an admission by a party opponent, but none of the options state that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the options again:

Option A: admitted, prior inconsistent statement. But prior inconsistent statement requires oath.

Option F: admitted because bearing on credibility. That's for impeachment, but the statement is being used for its truth.

So perhaps the correct answer is F, but that doesn't seem right because it's about impeachment, not substantive.

Wait, I'm getting more confused. Maybe I should think about what the options say.

Option C: admitted because cell phone use is relevant to negligence. Yes, that's true, but that doesn't address hearsay. So the statement could be relevant, but if it's hearsay, it's excluded unless an exception applies.

Option G: Statement against interest. But as an admission by a party opponent, it's non-hearsay, making G incorrect.

Wait, perhaps the answer is A, but that requires the prior statement to be under oath, which it's not. So A is incorrect.

Alternatively, the answer is F, but again, that's about impeachment.

Wait, perhaps the statement is non-hearsay, so the correct option is C. Because the statement is about her cell phone use, which is relevant to her negligence. But the hearsay issue is addressed because it's an admission.

But none of the options mention that. So perhaps the intended answer is F because it's about credibility, but that's incorrect reasoning.

Alternatively, maybe the statement is hearsay, but admissible under statement against interest.

Wait, if the statement is against her interest, then it's admissible under 804(b)(3). So option G would be correct.

But earlier I thought it's an admission, making it non-hearsay. I'm torn between these two.

Wait, let me clarify:

Admission by a party opponent is under 801(d)(2), making it non-hearsay.

Statement against interest is 804(b)(3), which is an exception to hearsay.

So both could apply, but since it's the plaintiff's own statement, it's an admission, so non-hearsay.

Therefore, the testimony should be admitted because it's non-hearsay. But none of the options state that, so perhaps the closest is option C, which says it's admitted because relevant to negligence. But that doesn't address the hearsay point.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Since the statement is an admission, it's not hearsay, so it's admissible. Therefore, the correct option is C, but that's not directly addressing hearsay.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is A, but that's prior inconsistent statement, which requires oath.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing that the statement is being used in the defendant's case-in-chief, so it's not being used for impeachment. Therefore, the only way it can come in is if it's non-hearsay or falls under an exception.

Thus, the correct answer is that it's admissible as an admission by a party opponent, making it non-hearsay. But looking at the options, none state that. So perhaps the intended answer is F, but that's about credibility, which isn't the case here.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think of what the bar exam would expect.

In this scenario, the plaintiff's statement to the investigator is an out-of-court statement offered for the truth. So it's hearsay unless an exception applies.

Possible exceptions: prior inconsistent statement (but needs oath), statement against interest, or admission by party opponent.

Since the plaintiff is the party opponent, her statement is an admission, making it non-hearsay. Therefore, it's admissible.

Looking at the options, the only one that mentions admissibility is option A, C, F, G.

Option A is prior inconsistent statement, which is incorrect because it wasn't under oath.

Option G is statement against interest, which would be correct if it's hearsay but falls under that exception. However, since it's non-hearsay, G isn't the right reason.

Wait, but if the statement is non-hearsay, then the reason for admission isn't because of an exception, but because it's not hearsay at all.

So perhaps the correct answer is C: admitted because her cell phone use is relevant. But that doesn't address hearsay.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is F: admitted because it's inconsistent and affects credibility. But that's impeachment, not substantive.

Wait, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for the correct answer elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F, but I'm not confident.

Alternatively, I think the correct answer is A, but prior inconsistent statements not under oath can't be used as substantive evidence. So perhaps the correct answer is C, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the correct answer is F because the statement is inconsistent and bears on her credibility, so it's admissible for impeachment purposes. But in the defendant's case-in-chief, can he use it for impeachment? Or is it only the plaintiff who can be impeached during her testimony.

Wait, during the plaintiff's case, she testified. The defendant's case is now, and he's presenting evidence. So he can introduce evidence to contradict her testimony. So the investigator's testimony about her statement would be to show that she didn't see the light, which contradicts her earlier testimony about the bystander's statement implying the defendant ran the light.

But the issue is whether the statement is hearsay. If it's non-hearsay, then it's admissible. So the correct answer is that it's admitted because it's an admission by a party opponent, making it non-hearsay. But none of the options say that. So perhaps the intended answer is F, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the answer is F: admitted because the inconsistent statement has bearing on her credibility. But that's impeachment, which would allow the statement to be used to attack her credibility, but not as substantive evidence. But in this case, the defendant is using it as substantive evidence to show she didn't see the light, which would make it hearsay unless it's an admission.

I think I'm going in circles. Let me try to conclude.

The statement is non-hearsay because it's an admission by a party opponent. Therefore, it's admissible. Looking at the options, none directly state that, but perhaps the closest is option C: admitted because relevant to negligence. However, the real reason is that it's non-hearsay, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is F, but that's about impeachment.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is G: statement against interest. But I think it's better to go with the admission by party opponent reasoning, making it non-hearsay. Since none of the options mention that, perhaps the intended
