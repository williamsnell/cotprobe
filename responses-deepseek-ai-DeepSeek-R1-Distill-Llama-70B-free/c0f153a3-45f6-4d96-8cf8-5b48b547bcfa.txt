Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a train picking up water. Hmm, let's see what it's asking. The train is moving at 60 mph and picks up 15,000 pounds of water over 400 yards. I need to find the force and horsepower required. The options are from A to J.

Wait, right, force and power. So I remember that power is related to force and velocity. The formula for power is P = F * v, where F is force and v is velocity. But wait, I think the units might matter here because everything is given in different units.

First, let me note down the given values. The speed is 60 mph. But force is usually in pounds (which is a unit of force here, I think), and distance is in yards. Oh, and the mass of water is 15,000 lb. Wait, but pounds can be mass or force, so I need to be careful. Oh, right, in the context of the problem, 15,000 lb is the weight of water, so that's a force. But wait, no, wait. Water's weight is mass times gravity, so 15,000 lb is the force. But wait, no, maybe not. Sometimes in such problems, lb can refer to mass, but in contexts where weight is concerned, lb is the force. Hmm, confusing.

Wait, but the question says the train is picking up water, so maybe the 15,000 lb is the mass. Or is it the weight? Oh, I think in the US system, when they say pounds without specifying, it's usually weight. So 15,000 lb would be the weight, which is a force.

So the weight of the water is 15,000 lb. The train picks this up over a distance of 400 yards, moving at 60 mph.

I think the force required is the rate at which the weight is being picked up. Wait, but force is mass times acceleration, but here, the train is moving at a constant speed. So maybe it's more about the work done and the power.

Wait, power is work done over time. So the work done would be the force times the distance. But the force here would be the weight of the water, so maybe F is 15,000 lb? No, wait, no, because the water is being picked up over a distance, so perhaps the force is the weight per unit distance. Hmm, maybe not.

Let me think again. The train is moving forward, and as it does so, it's taking in water. The water's weight is 15,000 lb, which happened over 400 yards. So the force exerted by the train would be related to the rate at which it's lifting the water. But wait, the train is moving horizontally, so maybe the force is the component in the direction of motion. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the rate of doing work.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the power first. Power is energy per unit time. The energy here is the work done against the weight of the water. So Work = Force * distance. But the force here is the weight of the water, 15,000 lb, but that doesn't make sense because the distance is 400 yards, and that's the distance over which the water is picked up as the train moves. Wait, no, the water is being lifted, but the movement is horizontal. So perhaps the work is the weight times the vertical distance lifted. But wait, the trough is between the rails, so the water is being scooped up as the train moves forward. So maybe the vertical distance is negligible? Or perhaps the problem is considering the horizontal force.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try another approach. The power needed would be the force times velocity. So P = F * v. I need to find F and then compute P.

Wait, but what is F here? The force required to pick up the water. So the water is being accelerated from rest to the speed of the train. But wait, the train is moving at a constant speed, so maybe the force is related to the rate of mass being accelerated.

Oh, right! This is similar to the concept of the force required to accelerate a fluid. So the mass flow rate would be the mass per unit time. The force would then be the mass flow rate times the velocity (because F = dp/dt, and p=mv, so dp/dt = m' * v, where m' is dm/dt).

Wait, that makes sense. So F = (dm/dt) * v.

But wait, the units might need to be consistent. Let me think about the units here.

First, let's find the mass flow rate. The mass being picked up is 15,000 lb. Wait, but wait, 15,000 lb is the weight, right? Because lb is a unit of force (weight), not mass. So to find the mass, I would need to divide by the acceleration due to gravity. Oh, but in the English system, weight W = m * g, so m = W / g. But g is 32 ft/s².

Wait, but wait, sometimes in these problems, especially in engineering contexts, they might treat lb-mass as lbm and lb-force as lbf. But the problem says 15,000 lb of water, so I think that's the weight, so W = 15,000 lbf.

So mass m = W / g = 15,000 lb / 32 ft/s². But wait, units would then be lb·s²/ft, which isn't standard. Hmm, perhaps I should convert the units carefully.

Alternatively, perhaps I can work with the given data without getting into mass. Let me try another approach.

The train is moving at 60 mph. Let me convert that to feet per second because the distance is in yards, and 1 yard is 3 feet.

60 mph: there are 5280 feet in a mile and 3600 seconds in an hour.

So 60 mph = 60 * 5280 ft / 3600 s = (60 * 5280) / 3600.

Calculating that: 60/3600 = 1/60. 5280 * (1/60) = 88 ft/s. So the speed is 88 ft/s.

Wait, wait, 60 mph is 88 ft/s, yes. Because 60 * 1.46667 = 88.

Now, the distance over which the water is picked up is 400 yards. That's 400 * 3 = 1200 feet.

The time taken to cover 1200 feet at 88 ft/s is t = distance / speed = 1200 / 88 ≈ 13.636 seconds.

So in 13.636 seconds, the train picks up 15,000 lb of water. Wait, but is that the weight or the mass? If 15,000 lb is weight, then the mass would be m = W / g = 15,000 / 32 lb·s²/ft.

Wait, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Since the problem asks for force and horsepower, let's think in terms of force.

The force needed is the rate of change of momentum. Since the water is being accelerated from rest to the speed of the train, the force F is given by F = (m_dot) * v, where m_dot is the mass flow rate.

So m_dot is the mass per unit time. The mass here is the weight divided by g, so m = 15,000 lb / 32 ft/s² = 468.75 lb·s²/ft.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the weight is 15,000 lb-force, so the mass is m = W / g = 15000 / 32 = 468.75 slugs. Because 1 slug is 1 lb·s²/ft.

So the mass flow rate would be mass per unit time. The time taken is 13.636 seconds.

So m_dot = mass / time = 468.75 slugs / 13.636 s ≈ 34.34 slug/s.

Then F = m_dot * v = 34.34 slug/s * 88 ft/s = 34.34 *88 ≈ 3020 lbf.

Wait, that's about 3020 lb of force. Looking at the options, option F is 3025 lbw and 484 hp, so that's close.

Now for the horsepower. Power P = F * v. So P = 3025 lb * 88 ft/s.

But wait, horsepower has units of 550 ft·lbf/s. So let's compute this.

P = (3025 lb) * (88 ft/s) = 266,  3025 *88 = let me calculate that.

3025 * 80 = 242,000; 3025 *8=24,200 → total 266,200 ft·lb/s.

Now, to convert to horsepower: 1 hp = 550 ft·lb/s.

So P = 266200 / 550 ≈ 484 hp.

So the force is approximately 3025 lb and the power is 484 hp. Looking at the options, that's option F: 3025lbw and 484 hp.

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations because sometimes factors can be tricky. Let me make sure.

First, confirming the speed: 60 mph = 88 ft/s. Correct.

Distance: 400 yards = 1200 feet. Time is 1200 /88 ≈13.6364 seconds.

Mass of water: 15000 lb (weight) → mass m=15000/32 ≈468.75 slugs.

Mass flow rate m_dot = 468.75 /13.6364 ≈34.34 slugs/s.

Force F = m_dot * velocity =34.34 *88≈3020 lb. Close to 3025, which is option F.

Power P=3025 lb *88 ft/s=266,200 ft·lb/s. Divided by 550 gives ≈484 hp.

Yes, that matches option F.

To solve the problem, we analyze the force and power required for the train to pick up 15,000 lb of water over a distance of 400 yards while traveling at a constant speed of 60 mph. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Convert the train's speed to feet per second**:  
   \[
   60 \, \text{mph} = 60 \times \frac{5280 \, \text{ft}}{3600 \, \text{s}} = 88 \, \text{ft/s}.
   \]

2. **Convert the distance to feet**:  
   \[
   400 \, \text{yards} = 400 \times 3 = 1200 \, \text{ft}.
   \]

3. **Calculate the time to travel 1200 feet**:  
   \[
   t = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} = \frac{1200 \, \text{ft}}{88 \, \text{ft/s}} \approx 13.636 \, \text{s}.
   \]

4. **Determine the mass flow rate**:  
   The weight of the water is 15,000 lb, and its mass is calculated as:  
   \[
   m = \frac{\text{weight}}{g} = \frac{15,000 \, \text{lbf}}{32 \, \text{ft/s}^2} \approx 468.75 \, \text{slugs}.
   \]  
   The mass flow rate is:  
   \[
   \dot{m} = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{time}} = \frac{468.75 \, \text{slugs}}{13.636 \, \text{s}} \approx 34.34 \, \text{slugs/s}.
   \]

5. **Calculate the force**:  
   The force required to accelerate the water to the train's speed is:  
   \[
   F = \dot{m} \cdot v = 34.34 \, \text{slugs/s} \cdot 88 \, \text{ft/s} \approx 3020 \, \text{lbf}.
   \]  
   This is close to 3025 lbf, as given in option F.

6. **Calculate the power**:  
   Power is the product of force and velocity:  
   \[
   P = F \cdot v = 3025 \, \text{lbf} \cdot 88 \, \text{ft/s} = 266,200 \, \text{ft·lbf/s}.
   \]  
   Convert to horsepower (1 hp = 550 ft·lbf/s):  
   \[
   P = \frac{266,200}{550} \approx 484 \, \text{hp}.
   \]

Thus, the force is approximately 3025 lbf, and the power is approximately 484 hp, which matches option F.

**Answer: F**
