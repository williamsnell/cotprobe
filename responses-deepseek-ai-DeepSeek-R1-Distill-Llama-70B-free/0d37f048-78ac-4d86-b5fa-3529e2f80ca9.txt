Question:

A landlord was the owner of a vacant warehouse. On May 1, the landlord leased the warehouse to the tenant for a term of five years with a renewable option. The leasehold agreement provided in part:"The tenant hereby acknowledges that certain areas of the leased premises are in a state of disrepair and unsafe for the conduct of business. Nonetheless, the tenant agrees to assume full responsibility for the necessary repairs. Furthermore, the tenant agrees to indemnify the landlord for any loss resulting from the condition of the said premises. "Under the terms of the lease, the landlord delivered possession of the warehouse to the tenant on May 2. On that date, an employee of the tenant was working in the warehouse. He was moving some equipment into the warehouse when a section of the ceiling collapsed and fell on him. At the time the landlord and the tenant entered into their lease, only the landlord was aware that the ceiling was defective and needed to be repaired. Although the landlord could have remedied the defect before delivering possession to the tenant, the landlord didn't perform any repair work on the ceiling. The employee initiated suit against the landlord to recover damages resulting from his injury. There are no applicable statutes. If the employee prevails it will be because a

C: tenant cannot waive the implied warranty of commercial habitability.
D: landlord is absolved of all responsibilities once a lease agreement is signed.
E: landlord's failure to repair the defect is not relevant to the case.
F: covenant to indemnify by a tenant in favor of a land owner is against public policy.

Okay, so I've got this question about landlord-tenant law and premises liability. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

The landlord owns a vacant warehouse and leases it to a tenant for five years with a renewable option. The lease agreement says that the tenant acknowledges some areas are in disrepair and unsafe. The tenant agrees to take full responsibility for repairs and also to indemnify the landlord for any losses from the premises' condition. 

On May 2, the landlord delivers possession, and the tenant's employee gets injured when a ceiling collapses. The landlord knew about the defective ceiling but didn't fix it before handing over possession. The employee is suing the landlord.

I need to figure out why the employee would win. Let's think about the legal principles here.

First, I remember that landlords generally have a duty to ensure the premises are safe at the time of leasing. But there's also the concept of the implied warranty of habitability, but I think that mainly applies to residential leases. This is a commercial lease, so maybe different rules apply.

If the tenant agrees to take the place as-is and do repairs, does that mean the landlord is off the hook? Not necessarily. Landlords can't always shift all responsibility to the tenant, especially for latent defects they know about. Because the landlord was aware of the ceiling issue and didn't fix it, that might create liability.

Looking at the lease terms: the tenant acknowledges the disrepair and assumes responsibility for repairs, also agreeing to indemnify the landlord. But I think that a landlord can't contract out of all liability, especially for known dangers. The tenant might not be able to indemnify the landlord against the landlord's own negligence.

So, the question is whether the lease can shift the duty of care. I recall that a landlord's duty to third parties (like the tenant's employees) can't be shifted via the lease. The landlord still has a duty of care towards those who might be on the property, even after transferring possession.

Wait, but the tenant is responsible for the premises once they take possession. So, if the tenant takes possession and the landlord has no control, the landlord might not be liable. But in this case, the defect was known to the landlord before possession. So maybe the landlord had a duty to disclose or fix known dangers before handing over.

Another angle: the lease might try to have the tenant take on all responsibility, but the law might say that such a contract can't override the landlord's duty of care to third parties. So, even if the tenant agrees, the landlord could still be liable for injuries caused by known defects.

Looking at the answer options:

Option A says a landowner's duty to third parties can't be shifted to a tenant by lease terms. That seems right because the landlord can't avoid liability that way, especially for known dangers.

Option B says the tenant is responsible once possession is transferred. That might be true in some cases, but the landlord could still be liable if they knew about the defect.

Option C is about the warranty of habitability, which I think applies more to residential, so probably not relevant here.

Option F says the indemnity covenant is against public policy. I'm not sure about that. Some courts might enforce it if it's not against policy, but it depends on the situation.

Option J says the tenant's acknowledgment absolves the landlord. But if the landlord knew and didn't fix it, that acknowledgment might not be enough to absolve them.

So, putting it together, the employee would win because the landlord's duty to third parties can't be shifted via the lease. So the correct answer is A.

The case revolves around a landlord-tenant dispute where the landlord leased a warehouse with known defects to the tenant, who acknowledged the disrepair and assumed responsibility for repairs and indemnification. The landlord delivered possession, and shortly after, the tenant's employee was injured when a defective ceiling collapsed. The landlord knew about the defect but did not remedy it. The question is whether the landlord can be held liable despite the lease terms.

Key legal principles include the landlord's duty to ensure the premises are safe at the time of leasing and the inability to contract out of liability for known defects. While the tenant assumed responsibility for repairs, the landlord's duty of care to third parties, such as the tenant's employee, generally cannot be shifted through lease terms. The landlord's knowledge of the defect and failure to address it create potential liability, as the lease agreement cannot absolve the landlord of this responsibility.

Analyzing the options:

- **A** is correct because a landlord's duty of care to third parties cannot be shifted to the tenant via lease terms, especially for known defects.
- **B** is incorrect because the tenant's responsibility for the property does not absolve the landlord of liability for known defects existing at the time of leasing.
- **C** is irrelevant, as the implied warranty of habitability primarily applies to residential leases.
- **D** is incorrect because signing a lease does not absolve the landlord of all responsibilities, particularly for known defects.
- **E** is incorrect because the landlord's failure to repair is directly relevant to the case.
- **F** is incorrect because the indemnity covenant is not necessarily against public policy in this context.
- **G** is incorrect because the tenant's employee is protected under general premises liability principles.
- **H** is incorrect because strict liability does not automatically apply to landowners for injuries on their property.
- **I** is incorrect because the landlord's duty of care cannot be transferred to the tenant.
- **J** is incorrect because the tenant's acknowledgment does not absolve the landlord of liability for known defects.

The correct answer is **A**, as the landlord's duty of care to third parties cannot be shifted to the tenant through the lease terms.
