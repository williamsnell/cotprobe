Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Alright, let's see what it's about. The question is about gas volumes under different conditions, so I think it involves the gas laws. 

So the problem says: A chemist has a gas under a pressure of 33.3 atm, and it occupies 30 liters at 273 degrees Celsius. But he needs the gas under standard conditions. The question is, what's the volume then?

Hmm, standard conditions. I remember that standard temperature and pressure (STP) is usually 0 degrees Celsius and 1 atm. Oh wait, wait, sometimes it's 1 atm and 273 K, which is 0°C. So yeah, that's right.

So the given conditions are P1 = 33.3 atm, V1 = 30 L, T1 = 273°C. Wait, wait, wait. Oh no, wait, 273°C? That's not right. Because 273 Kelvin is 0°C. So 273°C is way higher. Wait, that can't be right. Because 273°C is like a really high temperature, much higher than room temp. Maybe the question has a typo? Because 273 K is 0°C, so maybe the question meant 273 K. Oh but the question says 273°C. Hmm, that's confusing. Well, I think I should go with what's written, unless I can be sure it's a typo. But perhaps the question intended 273 K. Let me think.

Wait, let's read the problem again. It says the gas is at 273°C. Oh wait, no, 273°C is a very high temperature. So perhaps it's a mistake. Because 273 K is 0°C, which is a common temperature in gas law problems. Maybe the question meant 273 K. But the problem says 273°C. Hmm, this is a bit of a problem because the two temperatures are vastly different. 

Wait, but let's proceed as per the given data. So T1 is 273°C, which is equal to 546 K (because 273 + 273 is 546). Because to convert Celsius to Kelvin, you add 273. So 273°C is 546 K. 

The standard conditions are P2 = 1 atm, T2 = 273 K (which is 0°C). 

Since the amount of gas is constant, we can use the combined gas law: (P1 V1)/T1 = (P2 V2)/T2. We need to find V2.

So plugging in the numbers:

P1 = 33.3 atm, V1 = 30 L, T1 = 546 K,

P2 = 1 atm, T2 = 273 K.

So (33.3 * 30) / 546 = (1 * V2) / 273.

Let me compute the left side first. 33.3 times 30 is 999. Then, 999 / 546. Let me compute that.

Wait, 546 times 1.83 is... let me see. 546 * 1.8 is 982.8, and 546*1.83 is 546*(1.8 +0.03) = 982.8 + 16.38= 999.18. Oh wait, that's close to 999. So 999/546 is approximately 1.83. So 1.83 = V2 / 273.

So V2 = 1.83 * 273. Let me compute that. 273 * 1.8 is 491.4, and 273 * 0.03 is 8.19. So 491.4 +8.19 = 499.59 liters. So approximately 500 liters. Looking at the options, option B is 499.5 l, which is very close. So the answer should be B.

But wait, perhaps I should do the exact calculation without approximation. Let's do that.

(33.3 * 30 * 273) / (546 * 1) = V2.

Compute numerator: 33.3 *30 = 999, 999 *273 = let's compute 1000*273=273000 -1*273=272727. So 272727.

Denominator: 546.

So V2 = 272727 / 546. Let me compute that.

Dividing 272727 by 546:

546 * 500 = 273000. Oh wait, 546 *500 is 273000. But our numerator is 272727, which is 273 less than 273000. So 500 - (273/546) = 500 - 0.5 = 499.5. So V2 is 499.5 liters.

Yep, that's exactly option B. So the answer is B.

To solve the problem, we use the combined gas law:

\[
\frac{P_1 V_1}{T_1} = \frac{P_2 V_2}{T_2}
\]

Given:
- Initial pressure, \( P_1 = 33.3 \, \text{atm} \)
- Initial volume, \( V_1 = 30 \, \text{L} \)
- Initial temperature, \( T_1 = 273^\circ \text{C} = 546 \, \text{K} \)
- Standard pressure, \( P_2 = 1 \, \text{atm} \)
- Standard temperature, \( T_2 = 273 \, \text{K} \)

We need to find \( V_2 \), the volume under standard conditions. Rearranging the equation:

\[
V_2 = \frac{P_1 V_1 T_2}{P_2 T_1}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
V_2 = \frac{(33.3)(30)(273)}{(1)(546)}
\]

First, calculate the numerator:

\[
33.3 \times 30 = 999, \quad 999 \times 273 = 272,727
\]

Now divide by the denominator:

\[
V_2 = \frac{272,727}{546} = 499.5 \, \text{L}
\]

Thus, the volume of the gas under standard conditions is approximately **499.5 liters**. The closest option is:

**B: 499.5 L**
