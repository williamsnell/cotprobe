Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question here about quality improvement and internal failure costs. Hmm, I need to figure out the right answer. Let's see what the question says.

The question is asking which technique effectively measures improvements in product quality as a result of internal failure costs. The options are A through J. 

Wait, internal failure costs... what's that again? I remember from my studies that quality costs are categorized into prevention, appraisal, and failure costs. Failure costs are further divided into internal and external. Internal failure costs are the costs incurred when defects are found before the product reaches the customer, like during production or inspection. External failure costs are after the product is sold, like repairs or warranties.

So the question is about measuring improvements in product quality due to reductions in internal failure costs. So, which technique would show that? Let's look at the options.

Option A: Inspection of in-process goods. That's more about appraisal costs, not measuring improvements. Inspecting during production might help find defects, but it's part of the process, not the result.

Option B: Monitoring customer complaints. Oh, that's external failure costs because it's after the product is sold. So this measures external issues, not internal.

Option C: Measuring time to manufacture. That's about efficiency, maybe, but not directly about quality or failure costs.

Option D: Comparing sales data. Sales could be affected by quality, but it's more of a market response. Doesn't directly measure internal quality improvements.

Option E: Counting products produced. That's about volume, not quality.

Option F: Checking raw materials used. That's more about material costs, perhaps waste, but not directly failure costs.

Option G: Tracking warranty expenses. Warranty is related to external failure costs because it's after the sale, like when customers make claims. So this isn't internal.

Option H: Evaluating employee performance. That's about HR or productivity, not directly measuring product quality improvements.

Option I: Tracking the number of products reworked. Reworking products happens when defects are found internally, so this is an internal failure cost. If this number decreases, it shows quality improvement because fewer products are defective and need rework.

Option J: Recording products returned. Returns are external failure costs because the product was sold and then returned by the customer. So J is about external issues.

So the question is about internal failure costs. The relevant metrics would be things like defects found before the product leaves the factory. Reworking products (I) and maybe scrap are internal. So the correct answer would be I, tracking the number of products reworked.

Wait, but another thought: internal failure costs also include scrap and rework. So if a company reduces the number of products that need rework, that's an improvement. So option I would effectively measure that. Similarly, if they track defects (though defects might not be an option here), but in the given options, I is the best fit.

So the answer should be I.

The correct answer is I. Tracking the number of products reworked is an effective way to measure improvements in product quality resulting from reductions in internal failure costs, as rework occurs when defects are identified and corrected internally before the product reaches the customer.
