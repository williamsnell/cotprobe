Question:

A very drunk man was sitting in a bar drinking. A businessman customer came and sat beside him. They did not know each other. The businessman had slightly grazed against the drunk man's body. "Man, are you trying to kill me or something?'' said the very drunk man. The businessman did not think anything of it, since he had barely grazed the drunkard. The drunk continued to bully the businessman, calling him made-up names, and saying things that were nonsensical to the businessman and to others at the bar who were listening to the drunk's boisterous and irrational rants. The drunk then took a gun out of his pocket and shot the businessman, killing him. At trial, the defense argued that the man could not form the specific intent to premeditate for first degree murder. Which of the following crimes is the defendant most likely guilty of under these facts?

Options:

A: Involuntary Manslaughter
B: Second Degree Murder
C: Voluntary Manslaughter
D: Aggravated Assault
E: Justifiable Homicide
F: First Degree Murder
G: Negligent Homicide
H: Self-Defense
I: Attempted Murder
J: Felony Murder

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about criminal law, specifically homicide. Let me try to unpack the scenario and figure out the correct answer.

Alright, the situation is about a drunk man in a bar. A businessman sits next to him, and they don't know each other. The businessman slightly grazes against the drunk man. The drunk gets upset, says something threatening, but the businessman doesn't think much of it because the contact was minor. Then the drunk starts bullying him, calling him names, saying nonsensical things. People around are listening, so it's a bit of a scene. Then the drunk pulls out a gun and shoots the businessman, killing him.

At trial, the defense is arguing that the man couldn't form the specific intent to premeditate for first-degree murder. So the question is, what crime is the defendant most likely guilty of?

Let me think about the different types of homicide. First, I remember that murder can be first-degree or second-degree. First-degree typically requires premeditation and deliberation, which means the killer thought it through and planned it. Second-degree murder is more about intentional killing without premeditation or in the heat of passion with adequate provocation.

Wait, but here the defense is saying he couldn't form the specific intent. So if he's very drunk, does that affect his ability to premeditate? I think voluntary intoxication can negate specific intent. So for first-degree murder, which requires premeditation and deliberation, if he was too drunk to form that intent, he can't be guilty of first-degree murder.

So then, what's the next possible charge? Second-degree murder is intentional murder without premeditation. But wait, does the defendant have the intent to kill? The scenario says he took out a gun and shot the man. So that's an intentional act. But second-degree murder might still apply if it's intentional but without premeditation.

Alternatively, if the killing was done in the heat of passion due to adequate provocation, it might be voluntary manslaughter. But in this case, the provocation seems slight—the businessman just grazed him. I don't think that's sufficient legal provocation to reduce it to manslaughter. Because for heat of passion, the provocation must be something that would cause a reasonable person to act rashly. A slight graze and some name-calling might not meet that standard.

Another angle: felony murder. But felony murder typically applies when a death occurs during the commission of a felony. The underlying felony here would have to be something like robbery or burglary, which doesn't seem to fit because the guy was just sitting in a bar and shot someone. Unless the act of shooting is part of another felony, but I don't think that's the case here. So probably not felony murder.

What about involuntary manslaughter? That's when the death is caused by recklessness or criminal negligence. But here, the defendant intentionally shot the victim, so it's an intentional act, making involuntary manslaughter unlikely.

So, putting it together: the defense argues he couldn't premeditate, so first-degree murder is out. The act was intentional, so it's murder but second-degree. Unless there's another factor.

Wait, could this be voluntary manslaughter? I thought that required heat of passion with adequate provocation. But the provocation here seems minimal—a slight touch and some verbal abuse. Courts usually require more substantial provocation, like an assault or something that would provoke a reasonable person to lose self-control. So maybe it's not enough for voluntary manslaughter.

Therefore, the most likely charge is second-degree murder because it was intentional but without the premeditation needed for first-degree. So the answer would be option B: Second Degree Murder.

Alternatively, if the intoxication is so severe that he couldn't even form the intent to kill, maybe it's a different charge. But the scenario says he took out the gun and shot the man. So he had the intent to shoot, which is enough for an intentional killing. So second-degree murder fits.

So I think the answer is B.

The scenario involves a drunk man who, after a minor graze from a businessman, engages in verbal abuse and eventually shoots and kills the businessman. The defense argues that the defendant could not form the specific intent to premeditate, which is required for first-degree murder. 

Key considerations include:

1. **First-Degree Murder**: Requires premeditation and deliberation. Voluntary intoxication can negate the ability to form specific intent, making first-degree murder unlikely here.

2. **Second-Degree Murder**: Involves intentional killing without premeditation. The defendant’s act of shooting the victim was intentional, fitting this category.

3. **Voluntary Manslaughter**: Requires killing in the heat of passion due to adequate provocation. The minor graze and verbal abuse likely do not meet the legal standard for adequate provocation.

4. **Involuntary Manslaughter**: Applies to reckless or negligent acts. The intentional act of shooting makes this inapplicable.

5. **Felony Murder**: Typically requires a death during the commission of a felony. No underlying felony is evident in this scenario.

Given the intentional nature of the shooting and the inability to establish premeditation, the most appropriate charge is second-degree murder.

**Answer: B**
