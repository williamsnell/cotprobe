Okay, let's see. I need to figure out how much Maria spends on lunch during a 5-day work week. So, the problem says she spends $9 each day. Hmm, that's straightforward. 

Alright, so each day is $9, and she works 5 days. So I think I need to multiply 9 by 5 to get the total. Let me do that calculation. 9 times 5 is... 45? Wait, yeah, 9*5 is 45. So that would be $45 in total for the week.

Now looking at the options, let me check each one. Option A is $35, which is 5*7, so that's not right. Option B is $50, which is 5*10, but she spends $9 daily. Option C is $60, that's 5*12, which is way too high. Option D is $59, that's almost 60, but that's 5*11.90 or something, which doesn't make sense here. Option E is $30, which is 5*6, not enough. Option F is $49, that's 7*7, but no, that's not relevant. Option G is $45, which matches what I calculated. Then there's H, I, J—those are higher or lower but don't fit 45. So the correct answer should be G.

The correct answer is G: $45.
