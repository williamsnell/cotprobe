If the speed of a neutron is given by $v_{\mathrm{n}}=\left(3 k_{\mathrm{B}} T / m\right)^{1 / 2}$, where $m$ is the mass of a neutron, then what temperature is needed so that the neutrons have a de Broglie wavelength of $50 \mathrm{pm}$ ?

Okay, so I'm trying to solve this physics problem about neutron diffraction. Hmm, the question is about finding the temperature needed for neutrons to have a specific de Broglie wavelength. Let me think through this step by step.

First, I remember that the de Broglie wavelength is given by lambda equals h over mv. Oh right, lambda = h/(m*v), where h is Planck's constant, m is the mass of the neutron, and v is its velocity. But wait, the problem gives me a formula for the velocity of the neutron: v_n = sqrt(3k_B*T/m). So I can probably substitute that into the de Broglie equation.

So the plan is to combine these two equations. Let me write them down:

lambda = h / (m * v)
and
v = sqrt(3 k_B T / m)

Substituting v into the first equation, I get lambda = h / (m * sqrt(3 k_B T / m)). Hmm, let me simplify that. The m in the denominator and the m under the square root might cancel out a bit. Let's see.

Breaking it down: The denominator is m multiplied by sqrt(3k_B T/m). Let me write that as m * sqrt(3k_B T) / sqrt(m). So that's m times sqrt(3k_B T) divided by sqrt(m). 

Wait, m divided by sqrt(m) is sqrt(m) because m^(1) / m^(1/2) = m^(1 - 1/2) = m^(1/2) = sqrt(m). So the denominator becomes sqrt(m) * sqrt(3k_B T). 

Wait, maybe I should approach this algebraically. Let me square the equation to make it easier. Let's square both sides of the velocity equation:

v^2 = (3 k_B T) / m

So v = sqrt(3 k_B T / m)

Now substitute into lambda = h/(m v):

lambda = h/(m * sqrt(3 k_B T/m)) )

Let me factor out the m terms. The denominator has m multiplied by sqrt(3kBT/m). So m is m^(1) and sqrt(m) is m^(1/2). So in the denominator, m * sqrt(... which includes m^(-1/2)), so overall, m * m^(-1/2) = m^(1/2). So the denominator becomes sqrt(m) * sqrt(3k_B T).

Wait, perhaps a better approach is to manipulate the expression. Let's see:

lambda = h/(m v) = h/( m * sqrt(3 k_B T / m) )

Let me write this as h divided by [ m * sqrt(3 k_B T) / sqrt(m) ) ]

Which is h divided by [ sqrt(m^2) * sqrt(3 k_B T) ) / sqrt(m) ) ]

Wait, that's getting a bit messy. Let me try another approach. Let me write the denominator as m * sqrt(3k_B T/m) ) = sqrt(m^2) * sqrt(3k_B T/m) ) 

Hmm, perhaps I can combine the terms under a single square root. Let me think: m * sqrt(a) where a is 3k_B T/m. So m * sqrt(3k_B T/m) equals sqrt(m^2 * 3k_B T/m ). Because m * sqrt(b) = sqrt(m^2 * b). So that's sqrt( (m^2)(3k_B T / m) ) ) = sqrt( m * 3 k_B T ). 

Wait, that's correct. Because m^2 times (3k_B T /m) is m*(3k_B T). So the denominator becomes sqrt(3 m k_B T). 

So now lambda = h / sqrt(3 m k_B T)

Let me rewrite that equation:

lambda = h / sqrt(3 m k_B T)

I can rearrange this to solve for T. Let's square both sides to eliminate the square root:

lambda^2 = h^2 / (3 m k_B T)

Then, multiply both sides by 3 m k_B T:

lambda^2 * 3 m k_B T = h^2

Now, solve for T:

T = h^2 / (3 m k_B lambda^2 )

Okay, so I have an expression for T in terms of known constants and the given lambda.

Now, I need to plug in the numbers. Let me collect all the constants.

Planck's constant h is approximately 6.626 x 10^-34 J·s.

Mass of a neutron m is about 1.675 x 10^-27 kg.

Boltzmann's constant k_B is 1.381 x 10^-23 J/K.

The given lambda is 50 pm, which is 50 x 10^-12 meters.

So let's plug these into the equation for T.

T = (h^2) / (3 * m * k_B * lambda^2 )

Let's compute each part step by step.

First, compute h squared:

h^2 = (6.626e-34)^2 ≈ let's compute that.

6.626 squared is approx 43.9, and 1e-68. So 43.9e-68 = 4.39e-67.

Wait, 6.626^2 is 6 *6 is 36, 6*0.626 is about 3.756, 0.626^2 is 0.391. Hmm, wait, no, wait. Let me calculate it correctly.

6.626 * 6.626:

6 *6=36, 6 *0.626=3.756, 0.626*6=3.756, 0.626^2=0.391.

Wait, perhaps a better way: 6.626^2 = (6 + 0.626)^2 = 6^2 + 2*6*0.626 + 0.626^2 = 36 + 7.512 + 0.391 ≈ 36 + 7.903 = 43.903.

So h^2 = (6.626e-34)^2 = (6.626)^2 x (1e-34)^2 = 43.903 x 1e-68 = 4.3903e-67 J²·s².

Next, 3 * m: m is 1.675e-27 kg. So 3 * 1.675e-27 = 5.025e-27 kg.

k_B is 1.381e-23 J/K.

lambda is 50e-12 m, so lambda squared is (50e-12)^2 = 2500e-24 = 2.5e-21 m².

Now, putting it all together:

T = h² / (3 m k_B lambda² ) = (4.3903e-67) / (5.025e-27 * 1.381e-23 * 2.5e-21 )

Let me compute the denominator step by step.

First, multiply 5.025e-27 kg by 1.381e-23 J/K:

5.025e-27 * 1.381e-23 = let's compute 5.025 *1.381. 5*1.381=6.905, 0.025 *1.381=0.034525. So total is approximately 6.9395. Then exponents: 1e-27 * 1e-23 = 1e-50. So 6.9395e-50.

Now, multiply this by lambda squared, which is 2.5e-21 m²:

6.9395e-50 * 2.5e-21 = 6.9395 * 2.5 = approx 17.34875, and exponents: 1e-50 *1e-21=1e-71. So denominator is 17.34875e-71 = 1.734875e-70.

So now T = 4.3903e-67 / 1.734875e-70

Dividing these numbers: 4.3903e-67 / 1.734875e-70 = (4.3903 / 1.734875) * 1e3.

Compute 4.3903 / 1.734875.

Let me approximate this division.

1.734875 * 2.5 = approx 4.337. Hmm, 1.734875 *2.53 = ?

Wait, 1.734875 * 2 = 3.46975. 1.734875 *0.5 = 0.8674375. So 2.5 is 3.46975 + 0.8674375 = 4.3371875.

Which is a bit less than 4.3903. The difference is 4.3903 -4.3371875 = 0.0531125.

So 0.0531125 / 1.734875 ≈ approximately 0.0306.

So total is 2.5 + 0.0306 ≈ 2.5306.

So T ≈ 2.5306 * 1e3 = 2530.6 K.

Looking at the options, the closest is option G: 2500 K. But wait, let me check my calculations again because I might have approximated too much.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute it more accurately.

Let me recalculate some steps.

Calculating h squared: 6.626e-34 squared is (6.626)^2 = 43.903, so 43.903e-68 → 4.3903e-67.

Denominator: 3 * m = 5.025e-27 kg.

k_B is 1.381e-23 J/K.

lambda squared is (50e-12)^2 = 2.5e-20 m²? Wait, wait, wait a second. Wait, 50 pm is 50e-12 meters. Squared is (50e-12)^2 = 2500e-24 = 2.5e-21 m². Oh wait, earlier I had 2.5e-21. So that part was correct.

So denominator is 5.025e-27 * 1.381e-23 = let me compute that more precisely.

5.025e-27 * 1.381e-23 = 5.025 *1.381 = let's compute exactly:

5 *1.381 = 6.905

0.025 *1.381 = 0.034525

Total 6.905 + 0.034525 = 6.939525.

So 6.939525e-50.

Multiply by lambda squared, 2.5e-21:

6.939525e-50 * 2.5e-21 = (6.939525 *2.5) e^(-50-21) → 17.3488125e-71 → 1.73488125e-70.

Now, T = 4.3903e-67 / 1.73488125e-70.

4.3903e-67 / 1.73488125e-70 = (4.3903 / 1.73488125) * 1e3.

Compute 4.3903 / 1.73488125.

Let me do this division more accurately.

1.73488125 × 2.53 = ?

2 ×1.73488125 = 3.4697625

0.53 ×1.73488125 = let's compute:

0.5 ×1.73488125 = 0.867440625

0.03 ×1.73488125= 0.05204624375

Total for 0.53: 0.867440625 + 0.05204624375 = 0.91948686875.

So 2.53 gives 3.4697625 + 0.91948686875 = 4.38924936875.

Which is very close to 4.3903. The difference is 4.3903 -4.38924936875 = 0.00105063125.

So 0.00105063125 / 1.73488125 ≈ approximately 0.000605.

So T ≈ (2.53 + 0.000605) * 1e3 → ≈2.530605e3 → approx 2530.6 K.

Looking back at the options, option G is 2500 K, and option I is 3000 K. 2530 is closer to 2500 than to 3000.

Wait, but perhaps I made a miscalculation in the denominator's exponent. Let me double-check the exponents.

Denominator calculation:

(3 m k_B lambda²) 

3 m =5.025e-27 kg

k_B =1.381e-23 J/K

lambda² = (50e-12 m)^2 = 2500e-24 m² = 2.5e-21 m².

So the denominator is 5.025e-27 *1.381e-23 *2.5e-21.

Compute 5.025e-27 * 1.381e-23 = (5.025*1.381) e^(-27-23)= 6.9395e-50.

Then multiply by 2.5e-21: 6.9395e-50 * 2.5e-21 = 17.34875e-71 = 1.734875e-70.

So denominator is 1.734875e-70.

So T = 4.3903e-67 / 1.734875e-70 = (4.3903 / 1.734875 ) * 1e3.

As before, this is about 2530 K.

Looking at the options, there's option G:2500K, option I:3000K.

Wait, but perhaps I should check using more precise calculations.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, let me check the initial formula. The problem says v_n = sqrt(3k_B T/m). So that's correct.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes in thermal physics, the average speed is given as sqrt(3k_B T /m), which is correct. So the substitution into lambda is correct.

So the calculation seems right, leading to T ≈2530 K. The closest option is G:2500 K.

But wait, let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of h squared.

h is 6.626e-34 J·s. So h squared is (6.626e-34)^2 = (6.626)^2 * (1e-68) = 43.9e-68 = 4.39e-67. That's correct.

Denominator: 3 m k_B lambda^2.

Wait, another point: did I include all the correct exponents?

3 m =5.025e-27 kg.

k_B=1.381e-23 J/K.

lambda squared is (50e-12 m)^2 = 2500e-24 m² = 2.5e-21 m².

So multiplying all together: 5.025e-27 *1.381e-23 = (5.025 *1.381) *1e-50 → 6.9395e-50.

Multiply by 2.5e-21: 6.9395e-50 *2.5e-21 = 17.34875e-71 =1.734875e-70.

So that's correct.

So T = 4.39e-67 /1.734875e-70 = (4.39 /1.734875) * 1e3.

4.39 /1.734875 = approximately 2.53.

So T≈2530 K.

Looking at the options, option G is 2500 K, which is the closest. But wait, none of the options is exactly 2500 except option G, which is 2500. So that's the answer.

Wait, but the options are:

A:2000, B:1500, C:5000, D:4500, E:3500, F:1000, G:2500, H:4000, I:3000, J:600.

So 2500 is option G. So the correct answer should be G.

To determine the temperature required for neutrons to have a de Broglie wavelength of \( \lambda = 50 \, \mathrm{pm} \), we start by combining the de Broglie wavelength formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{h}{m v}
\]

with the given expression for the neutron velocity:

\[
v = \sqrt{\frac{3 k_B T}{m}}
\]

Substituting \( v \) into the de Broglie equation gives:

\[
\lambda = \frac{h}{m \sqrt{\frac{3 k_B T}{m}}}
\]

Simplifying:

\[
\lambda = \frac{h}{\sqrt{3 m k_B T}}
\]

Rearranging for \( T \):

\[
T = \frac{h^2}{3 m k_B \lambda^2}
\]

Now, substituting the known constants:

- Planck's constant: \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \mathrm{J \cdot s} \)
- Neutron mass: \( m = 1.675 \times 10^{-27} \, \mathrm{kg} \)
- Boltzmann constant: \( k_B = 1.381 \times 10^{-23} \, \mathrm{J/K} \)
- Wavelength: \( \lambda = 50 \, \mathrm{pm} = 50 \times 10^{-12} \, \mathrm{m} \)

First, calculate \( h^2 \):

\[
h^2 = (6.626 \times 10^{-34})^2 = 4.39 \times 10^{-67} \, \mathrm{J^2 \cdot s^2}
\]

Next, calculate \( \lambda^2 \):

\[
\lambda^2 = (50 \times 10^{-12})^2 = 2.5 \times 10^{-21} \, \mathrm{m^2}
\]

Now, calculate the denominator:

\[
3 m k_B \lambda^2 = 3 \times (1.675 \times 10^{-27}) \times (1.381 \times 10^{-23}) \times (2.5 \times 10^{-21})
\]

First, compute \( 3 \times 1.675 \times 10^{-27} \):

\[
3 \times 1.675 \times 10^{-27} = 5.025 \
