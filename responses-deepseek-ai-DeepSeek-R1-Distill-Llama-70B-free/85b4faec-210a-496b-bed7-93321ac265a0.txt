Okay, so I've got this economics question here about taxes and their effect on the economy in the long run. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to work through it step by step.

The question says that taxes are cut in an economy that's already in equilibrium at full employment. I need to figure out what happens in the long run. The options are A through J, each with different outcomes on real output and the price level.

Wait, so the economy is at full employment. That probably means it's operating at its maximum potential, right? So, in the short run, cutting taxes might increase aggregate demand because people have more disposable income. They spend more, which could cause inflation if the economy can't produce more. But wait, this is about the long run, not the short run.

In the long run, things are different. The economy can adjust—like, the labor market can adjust, and production can change. If the economy is already at full employment, then cutting taxes might not actually increase real output because there's no more slack. So, any increase in aggregate demand (from the tax cut) would cause inflation instead of more production.

Wait, but taxes affect both aggregate demand and aggregate supply. Oh wait, no—taxes can affect both. For example, cutting taxes increases disposable income, which boosts AD. But in the long run, if the economy is at full employment, the AS is vertical, meaning that any increase in AD beyond that point just leads to higher prices, not more output.

So, in the long run, cutting taxes when the economy is at full employment would cause the price level to rise, but real output (which is at full employment) wouldn't change. Because the economy can't produce more than its potential; so any extra demand just causes inflation.

Let me think again. If the economy is at full employment, the long-run aggregate supply curve is vertical. So, any shift in aggregate demand (like from a tax cut) would move the equilibrium along the vertical AS curve, but real output remains the same, and the price level increases.

So the tax cut would cause the price level to rise, but real output stays the same. So, the correct answer would be one where real output doesn't change, but the price level increases.

Looking at the options: Let's see.

Option G says "raise the price level." So, that would be correct if real output isn't affected. What's the option that says price level rises and real output is unchanged?

Wait, let me check each option.

Option A: No effect on price, raise real output. No, because at full employment, output can't increase.

Option B: Lower real output without affecting price. No, that doesn't fit.

Option C: Lower price level. No, because cutting taxes would increase AD, leading to higher prices.

Option D: No effect on either. No, because AD does affect price level when AS is vertical.

Option E: Raise real output and lower price. No, because output can't rise.

Option F: Lower real output and lower price. No, that's opposite.

Option G: Raise price level. That's correct, but does it say anything about real output? Oh, the option is just "raise the price level." But in the question, the possible options might have more specific answers.

Wait, looking back, the options are: each option describes the effect on real output and the price level.

So, let me re-read the question. The question asks, in the long run, the tax cut will... So, what's the effect on real output and the price level.

So, in the long run, when the economy is at full employment (long-run equilibrium), cutting taxes will increase AD. Because people have more money, so they spend more. But since the economy can't produce more (full employment), the only effect is on prices. So, the price level increases, and real output remains the same.

So, the correct answer should be that real output doesn't change, and the price level rises. Let's look at the options again.

Looking at the options:

Option G: raise the price level. But this option doesn't mention real output. Wait, no, all the options describe both real output and price level. Let me check: the options are phrased as "have no effect on the price level but raise real output", etc.

Wait, no, each option describes both aspects. For example, option G says "raise the price level." Wait, no, looking again:

Wait, the options are:

A: no price effect, raise output.

B: lower output, no price.

C: lower price.

D: no effect on either.

E: raise output, lower price.

F: lower output, lower price.

G: raise price.

Wait, no, looking at the options again, let me reread correctly.

Ah, I see that in the options, each one describes both variables. Let me list them properly.

Option A: have no effect on the price level but raise real output.

So, price level same, output up.

Option B: lower real output without affecting the price level.

Output down, price same.

Option C: lower the price level. (So, real output not specified? Or does each option cover both? Wait, the way the options are phrased, each option describes the effect on both variables.

Wait, perhaps I should read each option's full text.

Looking again:

Option A: have no effect on the price level but raise real output.

So, price level doesn't change, output up.

Option B: lower real output without affecting the price level.

Output down, price same.

Option C: lower the price level.

Wait, perhaps the options are not all two-variables. No, that can't be, because the question is about the effect on both.

Wait, perhaps the options describe the two variables.

Wait, perhaps I misread the options. Let me read all of them carefully.

The options:

A: have no effect on the price level but raise real output.

B: lower real output without affecting the price level.

C: lower the price level.

D: have no effect on real output or the price level.

E: raise real output and lower the price level.

F: lower real output and lower the price level.

G: raise the price level.

H: raise real output without affecting the price level.

I: raise real output and raise the price level.

J: lower real output and raise the price level.

Wait, so options C and G only mention one variable. Hmm. But the question is about both. So that's a bit confusing. Maybe the options implicitly say that the other variable remains the same unless stated otherwise.

Alternatively, perhaps the options are more accurately phrased. Let me think.

In the long run, after a tax cut when the economy is at full employment, real output remains the same (since we're at full employment, so AS can't increase), and the price level increases because AD has shifted right, but supply can't respond, so prices go up.

So, the correct outcome is that real output stays the same and the price level rises.

Looking at the options, which one matches that?

Option G says raise the price level. But what about real output? Because the option doesn't say anything about it, perhaps implying that it's unaffected.

Alternatively, option I and J talk about both variables. Let's check.

Option I: raise real output and raise the price level. So, output up and price up. That can't be right because at full employment, output can't increase.

Option J: lower real output and raise the price level. Output down, which also doesn't fit because output was at full employment.

Option D: no effect on real output or the price level. No, because price level does increase.

Option G: raise the price level. So, real output remains the same, price level up.

But wait, does option G imply that real output remains the same? Because the option doesn't state anything about real output, only the price level. But the question is about both. So perhaps I need to pick an option that says real output is unchanged and price level rises.

Looking back, none of the options explicitly say that. Wait, perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, another approach: think about the AS/AD model.

In the long run, the AS curve is vertical at the potential output (full employment). So, when you cut taxes, aggregate demand increases (shifts to the right). But since AS is vertical, the new equilibrium is at the same level of real output, but a higher price level.

So, real output doesn't change; price level increases.

Now, looking at the options, which one says that real output is unchanged and price level rises.

Looking again:

Option G: raise the price level.

Does that mean real output remains the same? So yes, because the option doesn't mention any change in output.

Wait, but the options are a bit ambiguous. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option I, but that would suggest output increases, which isn't the case.

Alternatively, perhaps none of the options perfectly fit, but the closest is option G: raise the price level.

But wait, let me check if I'm missing any option. Let me go through each:

Option A: output up, price same → No.

Option B: output down, price same → No.

Option C: price down → No.

Option D: no effect on either → No.

Option E: output up, price down → No.

Option F: output down, price down → No.

Option G: price up → So, output same, price up.

Option H: output up, price same → No.

Option I: output up, price up → No.

Option J: output down, price up → No.

So, the correct answer is option G: raise the price level.

But wait, are any other options more accurate? Because the question is about the effect on both variables, but G only specifies the price level. Hmm.

Wait another thought: perhaps when the tax is cut, it affects aggregate demand, but in the long run, the price level adjusts, and output remains the same. So, the correct answer is that the price level rises, and output remains the same.

So, in the options, the best fit is option G: raise the price level.

But wait, another angle: taxes can affect both AD and AS. Wait, for example, a tax cut could affect supply if it's a tax on production. But the question just says "taxes are cut"—so perhaps it's income taxes, which affect AD, not AS.

But in the long run, AS is vertical, so AD shifts only affect price.

So, the conclusion is that price level rises, output same.

So, the answer is G.
</think>

When taxes are cut in an economy that is already in equilibrium at full employment, the long-run effects can be analyzed using the aggregate demand and supply (AD-AS) framework. At full employment, the long-run aggregate supply (LRAS) curve is vertical, meaning that real output is fixed at the economy's potential output. 

Cutting taxes increases disposable income, which shifts the aggregate demand (AD) curve to the right. However, since the economy is already at full employment, the vertical LRAS curve prevents real output from increasing. Instead, the shift in AD leads to an increase in the price level, as higher demand chases a fixed level of output.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: "Have no effect on the price level but raise real output." Incorrect, as real output cannot increase at full employment, and the price level will rise due to higher AD.
- **Option B**: "Lower real output without affecting the price level." Incorrect, as real output remains at full employment, and the price level rises.
- **Option C**: "Lower the price level." Incorrect, as the price level rises, not falls.
- **Option D**: "Have no effect on real output or the price level." Incorrect, as the price level is affected.
- **Option E**: "Raise real output and lower the price level." Incorrect, as real output cannot increase, and the price level rises.
- **Option F**: "Lower real output and lower the price level." Incorrect, as real output remains unchanged, and the price level rises.
- **Option G**: "Raise the price level." Correct, as the price level rises while real output remains unchanged.
- **Option H**: "Raise real output without affecting the price level." Incorrect, as real output cannot increase.
- **Option I**: "Raise real output and raise the price level." Incorrect, as real output cannot increase.
- **Option J**: "Lower real output and raise the price level." Incorrect, as real output remains unchanged.

The correct answer is **Option G**, as the price level rises while real output remains at full employment.
