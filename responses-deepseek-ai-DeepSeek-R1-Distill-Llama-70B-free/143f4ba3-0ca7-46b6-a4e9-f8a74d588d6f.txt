Okay, so I've got this motor problem to solve. Let me read through it again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The question says that the armature resistance is 0.1 ohms. When connected to a 110-volt mains, the armature takes 20 amps and runs at 1200 rpm. Then, the question is asking for the speed when the armature current increases to 50 amps, with the field increased by 10%. The options are from A to J, each with different rpm values.

Hmm, I think this is related to the operation of a DC motor. I remember that in DC motors, the speed is related to the armature voltage and the field current. The basic formula is something like speed (N) is proportional to (V - IaRa) divided by φ, where V is the applied voltage, Ia is armature current, Ra is armature resistance, and φ is the flux per pole. Oh wait, but in some cases, if the field is changed, the flux changes, which affects the speed.

Wait, so for a shunt motor, the flux is proportional to the field current. If the field is increased by 10%, that would mean the flux increases by 10% as well. Or wait, maybe it's that the field current is increased by 10%, leading to a higher flux. But how does that affect the speed?

I remember that the speed of a DC motor can be approximated by N = (V - IaRa) * (1 / φ) * K, where K is some constant. Or maybe it's N = (V - IaRa) / (k * φ), where k is another constant. Alternatively, the exact formula might be more detailed, but for this problem, perhaps I can find the ratio of speeds.

Wait, let me think. The two cases are:

1. Initial case: V1 = 110 V, Ia1 = 20 A, Ra = 0.1 ohms, N1 = 1200 rpm.
2. Second case: V2 = 110 V, Ia2 = 50 A, Ra same, field increased by 10%, so flux φ2 = 1.1 * φ1.

I need to find N2.

Assuming that in both cases, the motor is operating under the same conditions except for the changes mentioned. So let me model the speed equation.

The speed of a DC motor is given by N = (V - IaRa) / (kφ), where k is a constant that includes the motor's construction details. So for the same motor, k remains the same.

So for the first case: N1 = (V - Ia1 * Ra) / (k φ1) = 1200 rpm.

For the second case: N2 = (V - Ia2 * Ra) / (k φ2).

But φ2 = 1.1 φ1, so substituting that in:

N2 = (V - Ia2 Ra) / (k * 1.1 φ1).

I can write the ratio N2/N1 as [(V - Ia2 Ra)/(k 1.1 φ1)] / [ (V - Ia1 Ra)/(k φ1) ) ].

Simplifying, the k and φ1 cancel out, so:

N2/N1 = [ (V - Ia2 Ra) / 1.1 ] / (V - Ia1 Ra )

So let's compute each term.

First, calculate V - Ia1 Ra:

V is 110 V, Ia1 is 20 A, Ra is 0.1 ohms.

So 20 * 0.1 = 2 volts. So 110 - 2 = 108 volts.

Then, V - Ia2 Ra is 110 - (50 * 0.1) = 110 - 5 = 105 volts.

So plugging into the ratio:

N2/N1 = (105 / 1.1) / 108.

Wait, no, let me correct that. The numerator in the N2 equation is (105) divided by 1.1, because the denominator is 1.1. Then, that's divided by 108.

Wait, alternatively, N2 = [ (105) / (1.1) ] * (1/108) ) * N1.

Wait, no, the ratio N2/N1 is [ (105) / (1.1 * 108) ) ].

Wait, perhaps I should compute it step by step.

Compute numerator: (V - Ia2 Ra) = 110 - (50 * 0.1) = 110 - 5 = 105 V.

Denominator part for N2: k * 1.1 φ1.

So N2 = 105 / (k * 1.1 φ1 )

N1 is 1200 = 108 / (k φ1 )

So N2 = (105) / (1.1) * (1/(k φ1 )) 

But from N1 = 108/(k φ1 ) = 1200, so 1/(k φ1 ) = 1200 / 108.

Thus, N2 = (105 / 1.1) * (1200/108 )

Let's compute that.

105 / 1.1 = 95.4545...

Then, 1200 / 108 = 11.1111...

So 95.4545 * 11.1111 ≈ let's compute that.

95.4545 * 11 is approximately 1049.9995, which is roughly 1050. But wait, 1200/108 is approximately 11.1111, which is 100/9.

Wait, perhaps using fractions would be more accurate.

105 / 1.1 = 105 * (10/11) ) = (1050)/11 = 95.4545...

(1050/11) * (1200/108) → 1200/108 simplifies to 100/9 (since 1200 ÷12=100, 108 ÷12=9).

So, (1050/11) * (100/9) = (1050 * 100) / (99) → 105000 / 99.

Let's compute that:

99 * 1060 = 99 * 1000=99000, 99*60=5940 → 99000+5940=104,940.

105,000 - 104,940 = 60.

So 105000 ÷ 99 = 1060 + 60/99 → 1060 + 20/33 ≈ 1060.606.

So N2 ≈ 1060.606 rpm. Looking at the options, option D is 1061 rpm, which is very close. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors.

Wait, another approach: compute 105 / 1.1 first.

105 ÷ 1.1: 1.1 * 95 = 104.5, so 95 gives 104.5. The remainder is 0.5. 0.5 / 1.1 ≈ 0.4545. So total is approximately 95.4545.

Multiply by (1200 / 108):

1200 ÷ 108 = 11.1111.

So 95.4545 * 11.1111.

Compute 95 * 11 = 1045, 0.4545 * 11 ≈ 5. So total is approx 1050. But wait, this might not be exact. Alternatively, perhaps using exact fractions.

Wait, 105 / 1.1 is 105 * 10 / 11 = 1050 / 11.

Then, 1050/11 * 1200/108.

Simplify 1200/108: divide numerator and denominator by 12 → 100/9.

So 1050/11 * 100/9 = (1050 * 100) / (99) = 105000 / 99.

Divide 105000 by 99:

99 × 1060 = 99 × 1000=99,000; 99 × 60=5,940 → total 104,940.

105,000 - 104,940 = 60.

So 60/99 = 20/33 ≈ 0.606.

So 1060 + 0.606 ≈ 1060.606 rpm.

Looking back at the options, option D is 1061 rpm, which is very close. So the answer should be D.

Wait, but let me double-check the initial assumptions. Does the field increasing by 10% directly lead to a 10% increase in flux? Well, in a DC shunt motor, the flux is proportional to the field current. If the field resistance is changed, then the field current changes. But in this problem, the field is increased by 10%. Wait, does that mean that the field current is increased by 10%? Or is it the field voltage?

Wait, the question says "with the field increased 10 percent." I think that refers to the field current because the field is part of the shunt circuit, and if the field is increased by 10%, that would mean that the field current is 10% higher. Alternatively, if V is the same, then increasing the field current would require a lower field resistance.

Wait, but in this problem, when the field is increased by 10%, perhaps that refers to the field current. So if the initial field current is I_sh1, then I_sh2 = 1.1 I_sh1. Since the field resistance R_sh is the same (as nothing is mentioned about changing it), then the field voltage would have to change. Wait, but the supply voltage is the same (110 V). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps the flux is directly proportional to the field current, so if the field current increases by 10%, the flux increases by 10%, which is what I assumed earlier. So that part seems correct.

Wait, but wait another thing: in the first case, the field current is determined by the supply voltage divided by the shunt resistance. V_sh = 110 V. So I_sh1 = V_sh / R_sh.

In the second case, if the field is increased by 10%, perhaps that means that R_sh is changed such that I_sh2 = 1.1 I_sh1. So R_sh2 = V_sh / I_sh2 = 110 / (1.1 I_sh1) ) = (110 / I_sh1) ) / 1.1 = R_sh1 / 1.1. So R_sh decreases to 0.909 times the original R_sh to allow a higher current.

But I don't think the problem gives any details about the shunt resistance, so perhaps the way I approached it earlier is correct: flux increases by 10%, so φ2 = 1.1 φ1.

So that part of the calculation should be correct.

Another thing to consider: when the armature current increases, does that affect the flux? Well, in a shunt motor, the field is on the shunt circuit, and the armature current is separate. So the armature current doesn't directly affect the field flux, assuming that the shunt field is powered separately and the field current is controlled. So the only change in flux is due to the deliberate 10% increase.

So, going back, the calculation of N2 as approximately 1060.6 rpm, which matches option D: 1061 rpm.

So I think the correct answer is D.

To determine the speed of the motor when the armature current increases to 50 A and the field is increased by 10%, we analyze the problem using the DC motor speed equation:

\[
N = \frac{V - I_a R_a}{k \phi}
\]

where:
- \( N \) is the speed,
- \( V \) is the applied voltage,
- \( I_a \) is the armature current,
- \( R_a \) is the armature resistance,
- \( \phi \) is the flux per pole,
- \( k \) is a constant.

### Step 1: Initial Case
In the first case:
- \( V_1 = 110 \, \text{V} \),
- \( I_{a1} = 20 \, \text{A} \),
- \( R_a = 0.1 \, \Omega \),
- \( N_1 = 1200 \, \text{rpm} \).

The induced voltage in the armature is:

\[
V - I_a R_a = 110 - (20 \times 0.1) = 110 - 2 = 108 \, \text{V}.
\]

Thus, the speed equation becomes:

\[
N_1 = \frac{108}{k \phi_1} = 1200 \, \text{rpm}.
\]

### Step 2: Second Case
In the second case:
- \( V_2 = 110 \, \text{V} \),
- \( I_{a2} = 50 \, \text{A} \),
- \( \phi_2 = 1.1 \phi_1 \) (since the field is increased by 10%).

The induced voltage in the armature is:

\[
V - I_a R_a = 110 - (50 \times 0.1) = 110 - 5 = 105 \, \text{V}.
\]

The speed equation becomes:

\[
N_2 = \frac{105}{k \phi_2} = \frac{105}{k (1.1 \phi_1)}.
\]

### Step 3: Speed Ratio
To find \( N_2 \), we use the ratio of the two speeds:

\[
\frac{N_2}{N_1} = \frac{\frac{105}{k (1.1 \phi_1)}}{\frac{108}{k \phi_1}} = \frac{105}{1.1 \times 108}.
\]

Simplify:

\[
N_2 = N_1 \times \frac{105}{1.1 \times 108}.
\]

Substitute \( N_1 = 1200 \, \text{rpm} \):

\[
N_2 = 1200 \times \frac{105}{1.1 \times 108}.
\]

### Step 4: Calculation
First, calculate the denominator:

\[
1.1 \times 108 = 118.8.
\]

Then, calculate the ratio:

\[
\frac{105}{118.8} \approx 0.884.
\]

Finally, calculate \( N_2 \):

\[
N_2 = 1200 \times 0.884 \approx 1061 \, \text{rpm}.
\]

### Final Answer
The speed of the motor when the armature current is 50 A and the field is increased by 10% is approximately **1061 rpm**.
