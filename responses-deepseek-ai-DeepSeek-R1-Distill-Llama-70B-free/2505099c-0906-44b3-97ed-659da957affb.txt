Okay, so I have this problem about a plumber's pay for a 50-hour workweek. Let me try to break it down step by step. Hmm, the question says the plumber is paid $4.50 per hour for up to 40 hours. And then, for any hours beyond 40, he gets 1 and 3/4 times his regular pay. I need to calculate his total pay for 50 hours.

Wait, let me make sure I understand the overtime part. 1 and 3/4 times... So that's like one full pay plus three-quarters more. So if his regular pay is $4.50, the overtime rate would be 4.50 multiplied by 1.75. Let me calculate that. 4.50 * 1.75. Hmm, 4 * 1.75 is 7, and 0.50 * 1.75 is 0.875. So together, 7.875. So the overtime rate is $7.875 per hour.

Wait, no, wait. No, wait. Because 1 and 3/4 is the same as 1.75 times the regular rate. So yes, that calculation is correct. So for each hour beyond 40, he gets 7.875 dollars.

Now, he worked 50 hours. So the first 40 are regular pay, and the remaining 10 are overtime. Let me calculate each part.

Regular pay: 40 hours * 4.50. Let's see, 40 times 4 is 160, and 40 times 0.50 is 20, so total 180. So 40 *4.50 is $180.00.

Overtime pay: 10 hours * 7.875. Let me compute that. 10 times 7 is 70, 10 times 0.875 is 8.75. So 70 +8.75 is 78.75. So $78.75 for overtime.

Now total pay is regular plus overtime: 180 +78.75 = 258.75. Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see 258.75. Let me check the options again. Oh wait, option D is $258.80. Hmm, that's very close. Did I make a calculation error?

Wait, let me double-check my calculations.

Regular pay: 40 *4.50. 4.50 *40. Well, 4 *40 is 160, 0.5*40 is 20. 160+20=180. That seems right.

Overtime: 10 hours *7.875. Let me compute 7.875 *10. Well, 7*10=70, 0.875*10=8.75. 70+8.75=78.75. So 78.75.

Adding them together: 180 +78.75=258.75. So the total is 258.75, but the options don't have that exact number. The closest is D: 258.80. Wait a second, perhaps I miscalculated the overtime rate.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the overtime rate again. The problem states "1(3/4) time", which is 1.75 times the regular pay. So 4.50 *1.75. Let me compute that more accurately.

4.50 * 1.75. Let me break it down: 4.50 *1 is 4.50. 4.50 * 0.75 is 3.375. Adding those together gives 4.50 +3.375=7.875. So that's correct. So each overtime hour is 7.875.

Wait, but 7.875 multiplied by 10 is 78.75. So 180+78.75=258.75. So the exact total is 258.75. But the options given don't have that. They have D as 258.80, which is 5 cents more. Hmm, maybe I made a small mistake in the multiplication.

Wait, wait, perhaps I should calculate 7.875 *10 again. 7.875 *10 is 78.75, that's correct. So perhaps the options are rounded or there's a typo. Alternatively, maybe I misinterpreted the question.

Wait, let me read the problem again. The plumber is paid $4.50 per hour up to 40 hours, and 1(3/4) times for work in excess of 40. So that's correct. So 1.75 times the regular rate for overtime. So, 4.50 *1.75 is indeed 7.875.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the number of overtime hours. He worked 50 hours, so 50-40=10. So 10 hours of overtime. Correct. So 10 *7.875=78.75. So 78.75.

So 180 +78.75 =258.75. So the correct answer should be 258.75, but the options don't have that. The closest is D:258.80. Hmm, perhaps it's a rounding difference. Or maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the overtime rate is calculated differently. Wait, sometimes overtime is 1.5 times, but the question says 1 and 3/4, which is 1.75, so that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that 1.75 times might be 1.75 times the regular pay, which is 4.50 *1.75=7.875. No, that's correct.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the regular pay is $4.50, and overtime is 1.75 times that. So perhaps I should compute 40*4.50 =180, and 10* (4.50 *1.75) =10 *7.875=78.75. So 258.75.

Wait, maybe I'll check the options again. Let me see the options:

A:238.80

B:218.80

C:208.80

D:258.80

E:248.80

F:278.80

G:298.80

H:225.00

I:268.80

J:288.80

So D is 258.80, which is 5 cents more than 258.75. Maybe the problem expects us to round to the nearest cent, but 0.75 is exact. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation is done with more precise steps. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I should compute it as 4.5 *40 =180, and 4.5 *1.75=7.875. Then 7.875 *10=78.75. So 180+78.75=258.75. So the exact total is 258.75, but the option is 258.80. That's a 5 cent difference. Maybe the problem expects rounding, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the overtime rate.

Wait, another approach: Maybe the problem defines 1(3/4) as 1.75 times the regular rate, but perhaps it's 4.5 plus half of 4.5, but that would be 1.5 times. Wait, no, 1 and 3/4 is 1.75, so that's correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the 1.75 applies to the total time, but that doesn't make sense. No, the wording says 1(3/4) time for work in excess of 40 hours, so it's 1.75 times the regular rate.

Wait, maybe I should recalculate 40*4.50. 40*4 is 160, 40*0.5 is 20. So 180. Correct.

10*7.875: 7*10=70, 0.875*10=8.75. 70+8.75=78.75.

Total 180+78.75=258.75.

Hmm. So perhaps the intended answer is D:258.80, which is 5 cents off. Maybe it's a typo in the options, or perhaps I made a miscalculation. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses a different pay rate.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the question meant that the plumber is paid $4.50 for each hour, and for overtime, it's 1.75 times that, so maybe 4.50 * 1.75. Alternatively, perhaps the overtime is computed as 4.50 *1.5, which would be 6.75 per hour. Wait, but the question says 1 and 3/4, which is 1.75 times.

Wait, maybe I should try recalculating using 1.75 as a fraction.

1 and 3/4 is 7/4. So 4.50 *7/4 = (4.50 *7)/4.

4.50 *7 =31.50. Divided by 4 is 7.875. So that's correct.

So 10 hours of overtime would be 7.875 *10 =78.75.

So I'm confident that 258.75 is the correct total. But the option is 258.80. Maybe the problem expects rounding to the nearest cent, but 0.75 is exact. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses 1.75 as a multiplier after some other consideration. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is in the initial pay calculation. Let me think: 50 hours, but perhaps the first 40 are regular, and the next 10 are at 1.75 times. So 40*4.50=180, 10* (4.50 *1.75)=78.75. Total 258.75.

Wait, perhaps the options have a typo, and the correct answer isn't present. But looking at the options, D is 258.80, which is very close. Alternatively, perhaps the problem uses 4.5 as a weekly rate, but that doesn't make sense.

Wait, maybe I should consider that 4.50 is in a different currency or there's tax involved, but the question doesn't mention that.

Alternatively, perhaps the overtime rate is computed differently, like 4.50 plus 3/4 of 4.50. Wait, 3/4 of 4.50 is 3.375, so 4.50 +3.375=7.875. So same result.

Wait, perhaps I should check if any of the other options could be correct if I made a mistake. Let's see, what if I thought that the overtime rate is 1.5 times instead of 1.75? Then 4.50 *1.5=6.75. 10 hours would be 67.50. Adding to 180 gives 247.50, which isn't an option either.

Alternatively, maybe I added wrong. Let me add 180 and 78.75 again. 180 plus 78 is 258, then plus 0.75 makes 258.75. Yes, that's correct.

Wait, perhaps the answer options are in a different order. Let me check the options again. The options are A through J. The options are:

A:238.80

B:218.80

C:208.80

D:258.80

E:248.80

F:278.80

G:298.80

H:225.00

I:268.80

J:288.80

So D is 258.80, which is 0.05 more than 258.75. Maybe the problem expects us to round up, but I'm not sure why. Alternatively, perhaps the initial pay rate was intended to be $4.505 or something, but that's unlikely.

Wait, another angle: perhaps the plumber is paid $4.50 per hour, and for overtime, it's 1.75 times the total hours beyond 40, but that doesn't make sense.

Alternatively, perhaps the 50-hour workweek includes some other considerations, but the problem doesn't mention any.

Hmm. Well, I think the correct total is 258.75, but the closest option is D:258.80. So perhaps that's the intended answer. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the overtime rate.

Wait, wait, another thought: perhaps the problem uses 1 and 3/4 time as in, for each hour of overtime, the plumber gets 1.75 hours of pay. But that's the same as 1.75 times the regular rate, so same result.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem meant that the overtime is 1.75 times the total pay, but that would be different. Let me see: if the regular pay is 40*4.50=180, and the overtime is 10 hours at 1.75 times 4.50, which is 7.875, so 78.75. So same as before.

So I think I've double-checked all the possible angles, and I still end up with 258.75. But since that's not an option, I'll have to choose the closest one, which is D:258.80. Maybe the problem rounded up the cents.

To calculate the plumber's pay for a 50-hour workweek, we need to consider the regular pay for the first 40 hours and the overtime pay for the remaining 10 hours. The regular pay rate is $4.50 per hour, and the overtime rate is 1.75 times the regular rate, which equals $7.875 per hour.

1. **Regular Pay**:  
   For the first 40 hours, the pay is calculated as:  
   \[
   40 \, \text{hours} \times 4.50 \, \text{\$/hour} = 180.00 \, \text{\$}
   \]

2. **Overtime Pay**:  
   For the 10 hours worked beyond 40, the pay is calculated as:  
   \[
   10 \, \text{hours} \times 7.875 \, \text{\$/hour} = 78.75 \, \text{\$}
   \]

3. **Total Pay**:  
   Adding the regular pay and overtime pay together gives:  
   \[
   180.00 + 78.75 = 258.75 \, \text{\$}
   \]

The exact total pay is $258.75. However, the closest option provided in the question is **$258.80**, which is 5 cents more than the calculated total. This slight discrepancy may be due to rounding or a minor error in the options.

Thus, the best answer from the given options is:

**D: $258.80**
