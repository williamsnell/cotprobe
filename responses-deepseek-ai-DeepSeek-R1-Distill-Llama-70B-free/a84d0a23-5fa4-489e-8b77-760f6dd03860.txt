Okay, so I need to figure out which option satisfies tertiary prevention in a school setting. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on prevention levels, but I'll try to remember.

Wait, prevention levels are primary, secondary, and tertiary, right? Primary is about preventing problems before they occur—like promoting healthy habits to avoid diseases. Secondary is early detection and treatment, so things like screenings to catch issues early. Tertiary is about managing and reducing the impact of existing issues, helping people recover or adapt so they don't get worse.

The question is about tertiary prevention in schools. So looking at the options, I need to find something that targets students who already have a problem, helping them manage or recover.

Let me go through each option one by one.

Option A: Large-group programs for self-esteem. That sounds more like primary prevention, trying to build self-esteem to prevent issues from arising.

Option B: Mandatory health screenings. That's definitely secondary—catching health problems early.

Option C: School-wide campaigns for healthy eating. Again, primary, promoting good habits.

Option D: Small-group counseling for students affected by divorce. Divorce can cause emotional issues. If they're in the initial stages, maybe this is tertiary because it's helping them cope with an existing problem.

Option E: Teacher-parent meetings. That's more about monitoring progress, perhaps early intervention or support, but not specifically tertiary.

Option F: Individual counseling after institutional care. That sounds like tertiary because the student has already been through something serious and needs help re-integrating or dealing with the aftermath.

Option G: Career guidance. That's more about development and planning, so primary prevention.

Option H: Seminars on drug abuse dangers. Primary again, trying to prevent drug use before it starts.

Option I: Anti-bullying programs. These are usually primary, aiming to prevent bullying from happening in the first place.

Option J: PE classes. Definitely primary, promoting physical health.

Wait, so which is tertiary? The key is that tertiary deals with existing, ongoing issues. So options D and F are candidates.

D is small-group counseling for students affected by initial stages of divorce. That seems like tertiary because the students are already experiencing the issue and need help managing it.

F is individual counseling for students resuming after institutional care. That's also tertiary because the student has already been through a significant event and needs support upon return.

Wait, but the question is about tertiary prevention. So which one fits better?

Tertiary prevention aims to reduce the impact of an ongoing illness or injury that has lasting effects. So it's about managing and helping the individual recover as much as possible.

In option F, the student is resuming from institutional care, which suggests they've had a serious issue, maybe mental health or behavioral, and now need support to reintegrate. That's tertiary.

Option D is for students in the initial stages of divorce. Divorce is an event that can cause emotional issues, and providing counseling early on might be secondary prevention—catching and addressing the problem early before it becomes more severe. Or maybe it's tertiary if the issue is ongoing.

Hmm, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Tertiary is for established problems. If the students are in the initial stages, maybe it's secondary, but if the problem is ongoing, like dealing with the aftermath, it's tertiary.

Alternatively, perhaps D is tertiary because it's about helping students already affected. The initial stages might mean the problem is just starting, so addressing it early would be secondary. But sometimes, tertiary can include interventions that help manage ongoing issues, even if they're in early stages.

Wait, the key is that tertiary is for those who already have the condition, focusing on reducing complications and improving quality of life.

So in D, students affected by divorce are already dealing with the issue, so the counseling is to help manage and reduce its impact. That would be tertiary.

Similarly, F is about students resuming after institutional care—they've been through something serious and need help reintegrating, which is tertiary.

So both D and F could fit, but I need to pick from the options. Let me check the answer options again.

Looking back at the options, the correct answer might be F. Because institutional care implies that the students have experienced something significant, like mental health issues, and now require support upon returning. That's more clearly tertiary.

Alternatively, maybe D is correct. Wait, the question asks for tertiary prevention. So which is it?

Another approach: primary prevention is about preventing the problem, secondary is early detection and treatment, tertiary is managing and rehabilitation.

Option F is about individual counseling, which is targeted at specific students with specific issues, which fits tertiary.

Option D is small group, but it's about initial stages—maybe that's secondary.

Wait, but the timing isn't the only factor. If the problem is already present, tertiary applies. So if a student is affected by divorce, which is an ongoing issue, the counseling is to help them manage it, so that's tertiary.

So maybe both D and F are tertiary. But looking at the options, only one is correct.

Wait, looking up examples might help. Tertiary prevention in schools often involves interventions for students already exhibiting problems. For example, counseling students who are having behavioral issues because of family problems.

So, in this case, option F is individual counseling for students resuming from institutional care. That's clearly tertiary because they've had significant issues needing care and now need support to reintegrate.

But option D is small-group counseling for those affected by initial stages of divorce. That's more about early intervention, which might be secondary or tertiary depending on the context.

I'm a bit torn, but I think the correct answer is F. Or perhaps D.

Wait, perhaps the key is that tertiary prevention is aimed at reducing the impact of an already occurring condition. So both D and F could fit, but the question is which one is more clearly tertiary.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is D because it's providing support to manage the effects of divorce on the students, which is tertiary.

But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I should look for the most specific example.

Institutional care suggests that the student had a severe problem that required removal from their home, so upon return, they need intensive support. That's definitely tertiary.

So I'm leaning towards F being the correct answer.

Tertiary prevention focuses on managing and reducing the impact of existing issues, helping individuals recover or adapt to ongoing problems. In a school setting, this involves interventions targeting students who are already experiencing specific challenges.

- **Option A**: Large-group programs for self-esteem development are more about primary prevention, aiming to prevent issues before they arise.
- **Option B**: Mandatory health screenings are secondary prevention, focusing on early detection of health problems.
- **Option C**: School-wide campaigns promoting healthy eating habits are primary prevention, encouraging healthy behaviors.
- **Option D**: Small-group counseling for students affected by the initial stages of divorce could be seen as tertiary prevention, as it helps students manage the emotional impact of an ongoing issue. However, it might also align with secondary prevention if the focus is on early intervention.
- **Option E**: Regular teacher-parent meetings are more about monitoring progress and providing general support, not specifically tertiary prevention.
- **Option F**: Individual counseling for students resuming from institutional care is clearly tertiary prevention. These students have already experienced significant challenges and require targeted support to reintegrate and recover.
- **Option G**: Career guidance is a form of primary prevention, focusing on development and planning for the future.
- **Option H**: Seminars on the dangers of drug and alcohol abuse are primary prevention, aiming to prevent substance use before it starts.
- **Option I**: School-wide anti-bullying programs are primarily preventive, aiming to stop bullying from occurring.
- **Option J**: Physical education classes are primary prevention, promoting physical health.

Between **D** and **F**, both could fit the definition of tertiary prevention. However, **F** is the most specific and clear example of tertiary prevention, as it involves targeted support for students who have experienced significant challenges and require help to reintegrate and recover.

Answer: F
