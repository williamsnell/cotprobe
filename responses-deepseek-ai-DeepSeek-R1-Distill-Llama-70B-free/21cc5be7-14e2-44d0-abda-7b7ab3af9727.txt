Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to this math problem. The question is asking me to estimate 999 minus 103 and determine between which two numbers the difference falls. The options are given from A to J, each with different ranges. 

Let me start by thinking about how to approach this. I know that subtraction can sometimes be tricky, especially with larger numbers, so maybe I can simplify it. One method I remember is rounding the numbers to make the calculation easier. 

So, 999 is just one less than 1000, right? So if I round 999 up to 1000, that's a good approximation. Then, looking at 103, that's just a bit more than 100. Rounding 103 down to 100 would make the subtraction simpler. 

Now, subtracting these rounded numbers: 1000 minus 100 equals 900. But wait, I need to remember that I rounded both numbers. Rounding 999 up and 103 down might have affected the result a little. So the actual difference might be a bit different from 900.

Let me think about how much the rounding changed the original numbers. 999 was rounded up by 1 (because 999 +1 =1000), and 103 was rounded down by 3 (because 103 -3 =100). So the total effect of rounding is that I added 1 to the minuend (the first number) and subtracted 3 from the subtrahend (the second number). 

In subtraction, when you round both numbers, the overall effect on the result can be calculated. Let me see: when you increase the minuend by 1, the result increases by 1. When you decrease the subtrahend by 3, the result increases by another 3. So together, the estimated result is 900, but the actual result would be 900 minus these adjustments. Wait, no, wait. Because I rounded up the minuend and down the subtrahend, both changes would make the result larger. So the actual difference should be a bit less than 900 because 999 is a little less than 1000, and 103 is a little more than 100.

Wait, no, wait again. Let me clarify. Let's say the original problem is 999 minus 103. When I rounded 999 to 1000 (which is +1) and 103 to 100 (which is -3), the estimated result is 900. But the actual calculation is (1000 -1) - (100 +3). So that's 999 -103 = 896.

Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me compute it exactly: 999 minus 103. Let me do the subtraction step by step. 

999 minus 100 is 899. Then, since 103 is 3 more than 100, I need to subtract another 3. So 899 minus 3 equals 896. So the actual difference is 896.

Now, looking at the options, I need to see which range 896 falls into. The options are:

A: 500-700 → too low
B: 200-400 → too low
C: 700-900 → 896 is just above 900, so it's just above this range
D: 1,300-1,500 → way too high
E: 800-1,000 → 896 is within this range (since 800 <896<1000)
F: 900-1,100 → 896 is just below 900, so it's just outside
G: 400-600 → too low
H: 100-300 → too low
I: 600-800 → too low
J: 1,000-1,200 → too high

Wait, but E is 800 to 1,000. 896 is within that range because 800 < 896 < 1000. So the correct option should be E.

Alternatively, another approach: estimating without exact calculation. 999 is approximately 1000, and 103 is approximately 100. So 1000-100 is 900. But the exact answer is 896, which is very close to 900. So the difference is just under 900. Now, looking at the options, E is 800-1000, which includes 896. F is 900-1100, but 896 is just below 900, so it's not in F. So the correct answer must be E.

I think I might have gotten confused earlier when considering the rounding adjustments, but the exact calculation shows it's 896, which is in E's range.

To estimate \(999 - 103\), we can simplify the calculation by rounding the numbers. Rounding 999 up to 1000 and 103 down to 100 gives \(1000 - 100 = 900\). However, this is an approximation. 

To find the exact difference, we calculate \(999 - 103\). Breaking it down:

- \(999 - 100 = 899\), and since 103 is 3 more than 100, we subtract an additional 3:
- \(899 - 3 = 896\).

Thus, the exact difference is 896. Now, we determine which range this value falls into:

- **A: 500-700** → Too low.
- **B: 200-400** → Too low.
- **C: 700-900** → 896 is just above this range.
- **D: 1,300-1,500** → Too high.
- **E: 800-1,000** → 896 falls within this range.
- **F: 900-1,100** → 896 is just below this range.
- **G: 400-600** → Too low.
- **H: 100-300** → Too low.
- **I: 600-800** → Too low.
- **J: 1,000-1,200** → Too high.

The correct range is **E: 800-1,000**, as 896 is within this range.
