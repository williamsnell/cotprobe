Okay, so I've got this thermodynamics problem here, and I'm a bit new to this, so I need to think it through carefully. Let me read the question again to make sure I understand what's being asked.

The problem gives me two reactions, (1) and (2), with their respective ΔrH° values. Then, I need to find the ΔrU° for reaction (3). The reactions are all involving gases, and the data is at 298.15 K. Also, it says to assume gases are perfect unless stated otherwise.

So, reaction (3) is 4 HCl(g) + O2(g) → 2 Cl2(g) + 2 H2O(g). I need to calculate the change in internal energy (ΔrU°) for this reaction.

Hmm, I remember that ΔU is related to ΔH by the equation ΔU = ΔH - Δ(n_gas)RT, because ΔH = ΔU + Δ(n_gas)RT. Wait, actually, let me get this right. The formula is ΔH = ΔU + Δ(n)RT, where Δ(n) is the change in moles of gas. So, ΔU = ΔH - Δ(n)RT.

But wait, in this problem, I don't have ΔH for reaction (3) yet. So first, I probably need to find ΔrH° for reaction (3) using reactions (1) and (2), and then calculate ΔrU° from that.

Right, so I should start by determining ΔrH° for reaction (3). To do that, I'll need to manipulate reactions (1) and (2) to get the desired reaction (3).

Let me write down the given reactions:

Reaction (1): H2(g) + Cl2(g) → 2 HCl(g), ΔrH1 = -184.62 kJ/mol⁻¹.

Reaction (2): 2 H2(g) + O2(g) → 2 H2O(g), ΔrH2 = -483.64 kJ/mol⁻¹.

I need to get reaction (3): 4 HCl + O2 → 2 Cl2 + 2 H2O.

Let me see how to combine reactions (1) and (2) to get reaction (3). Let me try to write reaction (3) as a combination of (1) and (2) and their reverses.

Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to break it down. Let me think about the steps.

Let me reverse reaction (1). So, reversed reaction (1) would be:

2 HCl → H2 + Cl2, and ΔrH would be +184.62 kJ/mol⁻¹ (since reversing the reaction changes the sign of ΔH).

Now, if I multiply reaction (1) by 2, I get:

2 H2 + 2 Cl2 → 4 HCl, ΔrH = 2*(-184.62) = -369.24 kJ/mol⁻¹.

Wait, but maybe that's not the right approach. Let me think again. Let me see what reaction (3) is doing.

In reaction (3), 4 HCl is reacting with O2 to produce 2 Cl2 and 2 H2O. So, perhaps I can break it down into steps where HCl is decomposing into H2 and Cl2, and then those H2 and O2 form H2O. But I'm not sure if that's the best way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write reaction (3) as the sum of some multiple of reaction (1) and reaction (2), or their reverses.

Wait, to form reaction (3), perhaps I can proceed as follows:

Let me see. Reaction (3) is:

4 HCl + O2 → 2 Cl2 + 2 H2O.

Let me break it into two parts. First, the decomposition of 4 HCl into 2 H2 and 2 Cl2, and then the reaction of 2 H2 with O2 to form 2 H2O.

So, step 1: 4 HCl → 2 H2 + 2 Cl2.

This is 2 times reaction (1) reversed. Because reaction (1) is H2 + Cl2 → 2 HCl, so reversing it would be 2 HCl → H2 + Cl2, and ΔH would be +184.62 kJ/mol.

So, 4 HCl → 2 H2 + 2 Cl2 would be 2 times that reversed reaction. So ΔH for step 1 would be 2*(+184.62) = +369.24 kJ.

Step 2: Then, the 2 H2 and O2 would form 2 H2O. Looking at reaction (2), that's exactly what it does: 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O, with ΔH of -483.64 kJ.

Wait, but then putting it all together, reaction (3) would be the sum of these two steps:

Step 1: 4 HCl → 2 H2 + 2 Cl2, ΔH1 = +369.24 kJ.

Step 2: 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O, ΔH2 = -483.64 kJ.

Adding these together:

4 HCl + O2 → 2 Cl2 + 2 H2O.

Yes, that's exactly reaction (3). So the total ΔrH for reaction (3) is 369.24 + (-483.64) = -114.4 kJ/mol⁻¹. Wait, let me calculate that again.

369.24 - 483.64 = -114.4 kJ/mol⁻¹.

Wait, but that doesn't match any of the options given. Hmm. Let me check the options again.

Wait, the options are from A to J, and the values are like -150, -200, etc. So perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let me try another way.

Let me write reaction (3) as:

4 HCl + O2 → 2 Cl2 + 2 H2O.

Let me see how I can express this using reactions (1) and (2).

If I take reaction (1): H2 + Cl2 → 2 HCl, ΔH1 = -184.62.

If I reverse reaction (1), I get 2 HCl → H2 + Cl2, ΔH = +184.62.

Now, if I multiply that by 2, I get 4 HCl → 2 H2 + 2 Cl2, ΔH = 2*(+184.62) = +369.24.

That's the first part. Now, what about the second part of reaction (3)?

In reaction (3), after 4 HCl → 2 H2 + 2 Cl2, the next step is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. That's exactly reaction (2): 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O, ΔH2 = -483.64.

So adding these two steps:

4 HCl → 2 H2 + 2 Cl2, ΔH = +369.24.

2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O, ΔH = -483.64.

Adding these gives:

4 HCl + O2 → 2 Cl2 + 2 H2O, ΔrH = (369.24 - 483.64) = -114.4 kJ/mol⁻¹.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see -114.4. Hmm. Did I do something wrong?

Wait a second, perhaps I made a mistake in the stoichiometry. Let me check again.

Wait, in reaction (3), the products are 2 Cl2 and 2 H2O. So, when I add the two steps:

After step 1, I have 2 H2 and 2 Cl2 as products. Then, step 2 uses 2 H2 and O2 to make 2 H2O. So when adding, the 2 H2 cancels out, and O2 is a reactant, so the equation becomes 4 HCl + O2 → 2 Cl2 + 2 H2O, which is correct.

So the total ΔH is 369.24 - 483.64 = -114.4 kJ/mol⁻¹. But none of the options match this. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the sign again. Oh wait, perhaps I should have considered that when reversing reaction (1), I'm using the reverse so the HCl is on the reactant side. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe there's another approach. Let me think about writing reaction (3) as the sum of reactions (1) and (2), multiplied by some factors.

Wait, another approach: Let me see the target equation again: 4 HCl + O2 → 2 Cl2 + 2 H2O.

I can think of this as (Cl2 + 2 H2O) being formed from (4 HCl + O2).

Wait, maybe I can consider that reaction (3) can be broken into two parts: the decomposition of HCl into H2 and Cl2, then the H2 reacting with O2 to form H2O.

Alternatively, perhaps I should try using Hess's Law by manipulating the given reactions.

Let me think about using reaction (1) and reaction (2) in such a way that when added, they give reaction (3). Let me assign variables a and b to the multipliers for reactions (1) and (2), respectively.

The idea is to find a and b such that:

a*(reaction 1) + b*(reaction 2) = reaction (3).

Let me write each reaction with their stoichiometric coefficients.

Reaction (1): 1 H2 + 1 Cl2 → 2 HCl.

Reaction (2): 2 H2 + 1 O2 → 2 H2O.

Reaction (3): 4 HCl + 1 O2 → 2 Cl2 + 2 H2O.

Let me write the equations in terms of their chemical species:

For H2: a*(1) + b*(2) = 0 (since reaction (3) has no H2 on either side except as reactants and products).

Wait, perhaps it's better to set up equations comparing the coefficients on both sides.

Wait, this might get a bit complicated. Let me think. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the number of moles of each substance.

Let me write the equations:

Looking at reaction (3): 

Reactants: 4 HCl, 1 O2.

Products: 2 Cl2, 2 H2O.

So, let's see what each reaction contributes.

Let me try to express reaction (3) in terms of reactions (1) and (2).

If I reverse reaction (1), I get 2 HCl → H2 + Cl2. Let me call this reaction (1r).

If I multiply reaction (1r) by 2, I get 4 HCl → 2 H2 + 2 Cl2. Let's call this reaction (1r×2).

Now, reaction (2) is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. Let's keep that as is.

Now, adding (1r×2) and reaction (2):

4 HCl + O2 → 2 Cl2 + 2 H2O.

Which is exactly reaction (3). So, yes, that's correct.

So, the ΔrH for reaction (3) is the sum of ΔrH for (1r×2) and reaction (2).

ΔrH for (1r×2) is 2*(+184.62) = +369.24 kJ/mol.

ΔrH for reaction (2) is -483.64 kJ/mol.

Adding together: 369.24 - 483.64 = -114.4 kJ/mol.

Hmm, but that's not matching any of the options. So I must have made a mistake somewhere.

Wait, let's check the calculations again.

Wait, reaction (1) has ΔH of -184.62 kJ/mol for 1 mole of H2 reacting. So, reversing it gives +184.62 for 2 moles of HCl producing 1 mole of H2 and Cl2. So 2 moles HCl → 1 H2 + 1 Cl2, ΔH = +184.62.

Then, to get 4 moles HCl → 2 H2 + 2 Cl2, I multiply by 2, so ΔH becomes 2*(+184.62) = +369.24 kJ.

Then, reaction (2) is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O, ΔH = -483.64 kJ.

So, adding them: 369.24 + (-483.64) = -114.4 kJ.

But the options don't have -114.4. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign when reversing reaction (1). Let me double-check.

Reaction (1) is H2 + Cl2 → 2 HCl, ΔH = -184.62.

Reverse reaction (1) would be 2 HCl → H2 + Cl2, ΔH = +184.62.

Yes, that's correct. So, 2 HCl → H2 + Cl2, ΔH +184.62.

Then, to get 4 HCl → 2 H2 + 2 Cl2, I multiply by 2, so 4 HCl → 2 H2 + 2 Cl2, ΔH = 2*(+184.62) = +369.24.

Then, reaction (2) is 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O, ΔH = -483.64.

So, when we add them:

4 HCl + O2 → 2 Cl2 + 2 H2O.

ΔrH = 369.24 - 483.64 = -114.4 kJ.

But looking at the options, I don't see -114.4. So perhaps I did a mistake in the approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that reaction (3) has O2 as a reactant, so I need to adjust for that.

Wait, another approach: Let me consider the formation of HCl and H2O.

Alternatively, perhaps I should calculate ΔrU directly without going through ΔrH.

Wait, but no, I think the correct approach is to first find ΔrH for reaction (3), then calculate ΔrU from that.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the manipulation of the reactions. Let me try a different way.

Let me write the target equation (3) again: 4 HCl + O2 → 2 Cl2 + 2 H2O.

I can think of this as (2 Cl2 + 2 H2O) being formed from (4 HCl + O2).

Alternatively, perhaps I can express this as:

- Decompose 4 HCl into 2 H2 and 2 Cl2: 4 HCl → 2 H2 + 2 Cl2. This is 2 times the reverse of reaction (1). So, 2*(reverse reaction 1).

- Then, use 2 H2 and O2 to form 2 H2O: 2 H2 + O2 → 2 H2O. That's reaction (2).

So, adding these two steps, I get 4 HCl + O2 → 2 Cl2 + 2 H2O, which is reaction (3).

So, the ΔH for reaction (3) is [2*(+184.62)] + [(-483.64)] = +369.24 -483.64 = -114.4 kJ.

But this still doesn't match any of the options. Hmm. Maybe I should check the problem statement again to see if I made any mistake there.

Wait, perhaps I miscalculated the sum. 369.24 minus 483.64.

Wait, 369.24 minus 483.64: 483.64 - 369.24 is 114.4, so 369.24 - 483.64 is -114.4. So that's correct.

But the options don't have -114.4. Hmm. So perhaps there's an error in the way I'm combining the reactions.

Wait, another possibility: Maybe I should consider that when reversing reaction (1), I'm getting 2 HCl → H2 + Cl2, and that's correct. So, 4 HCl → 2 H2 + 2 Cl2, which requires 2 moles of reaction (1 reversed), hence 2*(+184.62) = +369.24.

Wait, but perhaps I should consider that reaction (3) produces 2 Cl2, which might involve twice as much as reaction (1) would produce. Hmm, maybe not, since I'm already multiplying by 2.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the way I'm combining the reactions. Let me try an alternative approach using Hess's Law.

Let me write the desired reaction (3) as a combination of reactions (1) and (2).

Reaction (3): 4 HCl + O2 → 2 Cl2 + 2 H2O.

I can think of this as:

a*(reaction 1) + b*(reaction 2) = reaction (3).

Let me write the equations for each species.

For HCl: In reaction (1), 2 HCl are produced. In reaction (3), 4 HCl are consumed. So, in terms of reaction (1), perhaps a is negative.

Similarly, for H2: In reaction (1), 1 H2 is consumed, in reaction (2), 2 H2 are consumed. In reaction (3), no H2 on either side except as part of the steps.

Wait, perhaps it's better to set up a system of equations.

Let me consider each species:

HCl: In reaction (1), 2 moles are produced. So, a*(2) = 4 moles consumed in reaction (3). So, 2a = -4 → a = -2.

Cl2: In reaction (1), 1 mole is consumed, so a*(-1) is the contribution from reaction (1). In reaction (3), 2 moles are produced. So, from reaction (1): a*(-1) + ... Wait, maybe I'm complicating this.

Alternatively, perhaps let's consider the number of moles of each substance in the reactions.

Let me define the multipliers a and b for reactions (1) and (2), respectively.

The overall reaction will be a*(reaction 1) + b*(reaction 2) = reaction (3).

Writing in terms of moles:

For H2:

Reaction (1) has 1 mole H2 on reactant side. So, a*(1) H2 consumed.

Reaction (2) has 2 moles H2 consumed. So, b*(2) H
