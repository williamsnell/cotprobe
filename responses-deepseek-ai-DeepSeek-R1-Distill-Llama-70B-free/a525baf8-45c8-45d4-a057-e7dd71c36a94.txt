Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out. Let's read it again: In a set of 20 positive integers, at least how many pairs of numbers have a difference that's a multiple of 10? The options are A through J, with various numbers.

Hmm, I remember something about this from my classes. Oh right, it's probably related to the pigeonhole principle. The pigeonhole principle says that if you have more pigeons than holes, at least one hole must contain more than one pigeon. So how does that apply here?

Wait, the question is about differences being multiples of 10. So when two numbers have a difference divisible by 10, that means they're congruent modulo 10. Because if a - b is a multiple of 10, then a â‰¡ b mod 10.

So each number can be categorized by its remainder when divided by 10. The possible remainders are 0 through 9, right? So there are 10 possible remainders, or 10 "holes" as per the pigeonhole principle.

Now, we have 20 numbers (the pigeons) and 10 remainders (the holes). According to the pigeonhole principle, if you have n items and m containers, and n > m, then at least one container has more than one item. Specifically, the minimum number in a container would be the ceiling of n/m. Here, 20 divided by 10 is exactly 2, so each remainder must have at least two numbers.

Wait, that means each remainder category has at least two numbers. Because 20 numbers divided into 10 remainders gives exactly 2 per remainder. So each remainder has exactly two numbers. But wait, that's when it's evenly distributed. The question is about the minimum number of pairs that have a difference that's a multiple of 10.

So for each remainder category, the number of pairs is the combination of the numbers in that category taken 2 at a time. Since each has exactly two numbers, the number of pairs per remainder is C(2,2) = 1. And since there are 10 remainders, the total number of such pairs is 10 * 1 = 10.

But wait, that's if each remainder has exactly two numbers. But the question says "at least how many pairs". So is 10 the minimum, or could it be more?

Hmm, no, because if the numbers are distributed as evenly as possible, with exactly two in each remainder, that gives exactly 10 pairs. If the distribution is uneven, like some remainders have more than two numbers, then the number of pairs would increase. But the question is asking for the minimum number of pairs, so the scenario where the distribution is as even as possible gives the minimal number of pairs.

Wait, no, wait. Let me think again. If I have 20 numbers and 10 remainders, and I want to minimize the number of pairs with the same remainder, I should spread the numbers as evenly as possible across the remainders. Because if I put more than two in a remainder, that would create more pairs. So the minimal occurs when each remainder has exactly two numbers, leading to 10 pairs.

So the answer should be 10, which is option B.

Wait, but let me double-check an example. Suppose all 20 numbers are in the same remainder, like all mod 10 equal to 5. Then the number of pairs would be C(20,2) = 190, which is way more than 10. But that's the maximum, not the minimum. The minimum is when the numbers are spread out as much as possible, which gives exactly 10 pairs.

Another example: if you have 3 remainders with 2 numbers each, and the rest with 2, but wait, no, 10 remainders, each with 2 numbers. So 10 pairs in total.

So yeah, I think the answer is B:10.

To determine the minimum number of pairs of numbers in a set of 20 positive integers that have a difference which is a multiple of 10, we can use the pigeonhole principle. 

When two numbers have a difference that is a multiple of 10, they are congruent modulo 10. This means they share the same remainder when divided by 10. The possible remainders when dividing by 10 are 0 through 9, giving us 10 "remainder categories."

With 20 numbers (the "pigeons") and 10 remainder categories (the "holes"), the pigeonhole principle tells us that each remainder category must contain at least 2 numbers. Specifically, since 20 divided by 10 equals 2, the numbers can be evenly distributed such that each remainder category has exactly 2 numbers.

For each remainder category, the number of pairs of numbers is given by the combination formula \( \binom{2}{2} = 1 \). Since there are 10 remainder categories, the total number of such pairs is \( 10 \times 1 = 10 \).

This calculation assumes the most even distribution of numbers across the remainder categories, which minimizes the number of pairs with differences that are multiples of 10. If the distribution were uneven, with some categories having more than 2 numbers, the number of pairs would increase. Therefore, the minimum number of pairs is 10.

The correct answer is **B: 10**.
