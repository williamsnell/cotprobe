Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about a rhombus FGHJ. The diagonals intersect at point K. They tell me that the measure of angle FJH is 82 degrees, and I need to find the measure of angle KHJ. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this.

First, I remember that in a rhombus, all sides are equal, and the opposite angles are equal. Also, the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles. Wait, no, wait. Do they bisect each other at right angles? Or do they just bisect each other? I think they bisect each other at right angles because the diagonals are perpendicular in a rhombus. Yeah, that's right. So, the diagonals cut each other exactly in half, and they form four right angles where they intersect.

Now, the diagonals intersect at K. So, point K is the midpoint of both diagonals. That means each half of the diagonals is equal in length.

Given that m∠FJH is 82 degrees. Let me try to draw this out mentally. Rhombus FGHJ. So, the vertices are F, G, H, J. The diagonals are FG and HJ, or wait, no. Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals connect opposite vertices. So, if the rhombus is FGHJ, then the diagonals would be FH and GJ. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again.

Wait, the rhombus is FGHJ, so the vertices are connected as F to G, G to H, H to J, J to F. So, the sides are FG, GH, HJ, and JF. The diagonals would connect F to H and G to J. So, diagonal FH and diagonal GJ intersect at point K.

So, angle FJH is the angle at vertex J, between sides FJ and JH. Oh wait, no. Wait, FJH is angle at J, formed by points F, J, H. So that's angle at J, between FJ and JH. Since it's a rhombus, all sides are equal, so FJ equals JH. Wait, no, JH is a side, and FJ is another side. So, in a rhombus, each angle's adjacent angles are supplementary. So, if one angle is 82 degrees, the adjacent angle would be 98 degrees, since 180 - 82 = 98.

Wait, but I'm not sure if that's directly relevant here. Let me get back to the problem. We need to find m∠KHJ. So, angle at point H, between points K, H, and J.

Wait, point K is the intersection of the diagonals. So, angle KHJ is the angle at H, formed by points K, H, and J. So, that's the angle between diagonal KH and side HJ.

I think I should probably draw the rhombus to visualize this better. Let me imagine it: rhombus FGHJ with diagonals FH and GJ intersecting at K. So, K is the midpoint of both diagonals.

Now, in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect the angles. So, each diagonal splits the vertex angles into two equal parts. So, if angle FJH is 82 degrees at point J, then the diagonal from J (which is JH and JF?)... Wait, no. Wait, the diagonals are FH and GJ. So, the diagonal from J would be GJ, connecting J to G.

Wait, maybe I should clarify the structure. Let's label the rhombus FGHJ, so the vertices are F, G, H, J in order. So, sides are FG, GH, HJ, JF. Diagonals are FG and HJ? No, that can't be right because FG is a side. Oh wait no, diagonals connect non-consecutive vertices. So, in rhombus FGHJ, the diagonals would be FG (connecting F to G) and HJ (connecting H to J). Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because in a rhombus, the diagonals are the lines connecting opposite vertices. So the diagonals are F to H and G to J.

So, in rhombus FGHJ, the diagonals are FH and GJ, intersecting at K. So, point K is where these two diagonals cross each other.

Given that angle FJH is 82 degrees. So, angle at J, between F and H.

Wait, angle FJH is at point J, formed by the sides FJ and JH. But in the rhombus, FJ and JH are adjacent sides. So, that angle is one of the angles of the rhombus. So, the measure of that angle is 82 degrees.

Since the rhombus has opposite angles equal, the opposite angle would also be 82 degrees, and the other two angles would be 180 - 82 = 98 degrees each.

Now, the diagonals of a rhombus bisect these angles. So, the diagonal from J, which is JG, would split the 82-degree angle at J into two equal parts. Wait, no, the diagonal is GJ, connecting G to J. So, the diagonal GJ would split angle FJH into two equal angles of 41 degrees each (since 82 divided by 2 is 41). But wait, is that correct? Because in a rhombus, the diagonals bisect the vertex angles. So yes, each angle at the vertex is split into two equal parts by the diagonal.

So, in this case, angle FJH is 82 degrees, so when diagonal GJ is drawn from J to G, it splits angle FJH into two angles of 41 degrees each.

But wait, I'm trying to find angle KHJ. So, angle at H between K and J.

Hmm. Let me think about triangle KHJ. Points K, H, J. So, point K is the intersection of the diagonals. So, in the rhombus, the diagonals intersect at K, which is the midpoint of both diagonals. Also, the diagonals in a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors of each other, meaning they intersect at right angles.

Wait, so the diagonals are perpendicular. So, the angle between the two diagonals is 90 degrees.

Wait, but how does that help me find angle KHJ?

Let me try to model this. Since K is the midpoint of both diagonals, and the diagonals are perpendicular, each of the four triangles formed by the intersection is a right-angled triangle.

In rhombus FGHJ, the diagonals FH and GJ intersect at K, forming four right triangles: FKG, KHJ, GKH, and HJF. Wait, maybe I should think of it as four right-angled triangles, each with legs equal to half of each diagonal.

So, in triangle KHJ, we have a right angle at K because the diagonals are perpendicular. So, triangle KHJ is a right-angled triangle with right angle at K.

Wait, but angle KHJ is the angle at H in triangle KHJ. So, in triangle KHJ, angle at H is one angle, angle at K is 90 degrees, and angle at J is another.

But I need to find the measure of angle KHJ, which is at point H.

Wait, maybe I can find some sides or use trigonometric ratios here. Alternatively, perhaps there's a way to relate the angles using properties of the rhombus.

Let me think about the angles at each point. Since angle FJH is 82 degrees, and the diagonal GJ splits it into two angles of 41 degrees each. So, at point J, the two angles formed by the diagonal GJ are each 41 degrees.

Now, considering triangle JHK. Wait, no, point K is on the other diagonal, FH. So, perhaps I should look at the triangle formed by points K, H, and J.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to consider the angles around point K. Since the diagonals are perpendicular, each of the four angles around K is 90 degrees.

Wait, but how does that help me find angle KHJ?

Alternatively, maybe I can look at triangle HJG. Wait, no, perhaps another approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the fact that in the rhombus, adjacent angles are supplementary. So, if one angle is 82 degrees, the adjacent angle is 98 degrees.

But I'm trying to find angle KHJ, which is an angle inside the rhombus but not one of the main angles. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can find the measures of the angles at point H. Let me think: At point H, the rhombus has two angles. One is at the vertex H, which would be 98 degrees if the adjacent angle at J is 82 degrees. Wait, no, because in a rhombus, opposite angles are equal. So, if angle at J is 82 degrees, the angle at H would also be 82 degrees? Or is it the opposite?

Wait, wait, no. Wait, in a rhombus, opposite angles are equal, and adjacent angles are supplementary. So, if angle FJH (at J) is 82 degrees, then the opposite angle at G would also be 82 degrees. Then the other two angles, at F and H, would each be 98 degrees, since 180 - 82 = 98.

Wait, is that correct? Let me confirm. In a rhombus, opposite angles are equal, and adjacent angles are supplementary. So, if one angle is 82, the opposite is also 82, and the other two are 98 each.

So, angle at J is 82 degrees, angle at H is 98 degrees.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the angle at J is 82 degrees. So the opposite angle, which would be angle at H? Or is it the other way around?

Wait, in rhombus FGHJ, the vertices are F, G, H, J. So, the opposite vertices are F and H, G and J. So, the angles at F and H are opposite, and angles at G and J are opposite. So, if angle at J is 82 degrees, then angle at G is also 82 degrees, and angles at F and H are 98 degrees each.

So, at point H, the angle is 98 degrees.

Now, at point H, the sides are GH and HJ. The diagonal FH connects F to H, and the other diagonal GJ connects G to J.

So, when diagonals intersect at K, they create angles around point K.

Wait, perhaps I should consider triangle KHJ. In triangle KHJ, we have points K, H, J.

We know that the diagonals are perpendicular, so angle at K is 90 degrees.

We can perhaps find the other angles in this triangle.

But to find angle at H, which is angle KHJ, we might need more information about the sides or other angles.

Alternatively, maybe we can consider the properties of the diagonals. In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Also, each diagonal bisects the angles at their respective vertices.

Wait, so the diagonal GJ bisects angle at J, which is 82 degrees, into two angles of 41 degrees each. So, angle GJH is 41 degrees.

Wait, but point K is the intersection point, so maybe in triangle KHJ, we can find angle at J.

Wait, no, in triangle KHJ, the points are K, H, J. So, angle at J would be the angle between JH and JK. But I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the measure of angle KHJ by considering the triangle and using some trigonometric ratios.

Wait, let's think about triangle KHJ. Since the diagonals intersect at K and are perpendicular, triangle KHJ is a right-angled triangle at K. So, angle at K is 90 degrees.

So, in triangle KHJ, angles at H and J must add up to 90 degrees because the total sum is 180 degrees.

If I can find either angle at H or J in this triangle, I can find the other.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find the measure of angle at J in triangle KHJ.

Wait, in the rhombus, the diagonal GJ bisects angle at J into two 41-degree angles. So, from point J, the diagonal GJ creates two angles of 41 degrees each.

But GJ is one of the diagonals, so it's split into two equal parts by point K.

Wait, but in triangle KHJ, angle at J would be the same as the angle between side HJ and diagonal JK. Hmm, maybe not directly.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the triangle formed by points H, J, and K.

Since K is the midpoint of the diagonals, and the diagonals are perpendicular, maybe the sides of the triangle can be related.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that in the rhombus, the diagonals create four congruent right-angled triangles.

Wait, in a rhombus, the diagonals divide it into four congruent right triangles. So, each of the four triangles formed by the intersection of the diagonals is congruent.

Wait, is that correct? Or are they only congruent in pairs?

Hmm, I think they are congruent in pairs. For example, triangles FKG and HJF would be congruent, and triangles FKJ and GHK would be congruent, but maybe not all four being congruent.

Wait, but in any case, each of the four triangles is a right-angled triangle, with legs equal to half the lengths of the diagonals.

But perhaps I'm overcomplicating things. Let me try a different approach.

Since angle FJH is 82 degrees, and the diagonal GJ bisects it into two angles of 41 degrees each, then angle GJH is 41 degrees.

Wait, angle GJH is the angle at J between GJ and JH. But in triangle KHJ, angle at J is between HJ and JK. Hmm, maybe not directly related.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider triangle HJK. Wait, triangle HJK is a right-angled triangle at K because the diagonals are perpendicular.

So, in triangle HJK, angle at K is 90 degrees, angle at J is 41 degrees, so angle at H would be 49 degrees because 180 - 90 - 41 = 49.

Wait, is that correct? Wait, if angle at J is 41 degrees, then angle at H would be 49 degrees, making angle KHJ 49 degrees. But I'm not sure if angle at J is 41 degrees in triangle HJK.

Wait, let me clarify. The diagonal GJ splits angle FJH (82 degrees) into two 41-degree angles. So, angle GJH is 41 degrees, which is at point J between GJ and JH.

In triangle HJK, the points are H, J, K. So, in this triangle, the angle at J is between HJ and JK. But GJ is a diagonal, so JK is part of that diagonal. Wait, no. Wait, K is the intersection point, so JK is the segment from J to K along diagonal GJ. So, in triangle HJK, the angle at J is between HJ (side of the rhombus) and JK (part of diagonal GJ). So, that angle is the same as angle GJH, which is 41 degrees.

Therefore, in triangle HJK, angle at J is 41 degrees, angle at K is 90 degrees, so angle at H (which is angle KHJ) is 180 - 90 - 41 = 49 degrees.

So, the measure of angle KHJ is 49 degrees, which corresponds to option E.

In the rhombus FGHJ, the diagonals FH and GJ intersect at point K, which is the midpoint of both diagonals. The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, forming four right-angled triangles within the rhombus. 

Given that \( m\angle FJH = 82^\circ \), this angle is one of the vertex angles of the rhombus at point J. In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect the vertex angles into two equal parts. Therefore, the diagonal GJ splits \( \angle FJH \) into two angles of \( 41^\circ \) each. 

In triangle KHJ, which is a right-angled triangle at K (since the diagonals are perpendicular), the angle at J is \( 41^\circ \). The sum of angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \), so the remaining angle at H (which is \( \angle KHJ \)) can be calculated as:

\[
m\angle KHJ = 180^\circ - 90^\circ - 41^\circ = 49^\circ
\]

Thus, the measure of \( \angle KHJ \) is \( 49^\circ \).

E: 49
