The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

What is an EPSP? What is an IPSP? How do they affect a nerve cell's excitability?

Options:

A: EPSP and IPSP are types of nerve cells.
B: Both EPSP and IPSP reduce the likelihood of a nerve cell reaching threshold and firing an action potential.
C: EPSP and IPSP are neurotransmitters released by glial cells that do not directly affect nerve cells.
D: EPSP refers to a nerve cell's energy production surge, while IPSP refers to its energy conservation state.
E: EPSP is an inhibitory postsynaptic potential and IPSP is an excitatory postsynaptic potential.
F: An EPSP is a permanent change in nerve cell excitability, while an IPSP is a temporary change that lasts only a few seconds.
G: An EPSP is an excitatory postsynaptic potential making a nerve cell more likely to fire and an IPSP is an inhibitory post synaptic potential making it less likely to fire.
H: EPSP is a protein that enhances nerve growth, and IPSP is a molecule that prevents nerve growth.
I: EPSP increases a nerve cell's excitability by decreasing its membrane potential, while IPSP decreases excitability by increasing the membrane potential.
J: EPSP and IPSP do not affect a nerve cell's excitability.

Okay, so I have this question about EPSP and IPSP, and I'm a bit rusty on my neuroscience, but I'll try to think it through. I remember that these have something to do with how neurons communicate and affect each other's firing.

Wait, EPSP stands for excitatory postsynaptic potential, right? And IPSP is inhibitory postsynaptic potential. I think they're related to the potentials in the postsynaptic neuron after it receives signals from another neuron.

So, when a neuron receives a signal, it can either get excited or inhibited. Excitatory signals make it more likely to fire an action potential, while inhibitory make it less likely. So EPSPs would be when the postsynaptic neuron's membrane potential becomes more positive, moving towards the threshold. That makes sense because if the membrane potential is more positive, it's closer to firing. IPSPs would do the opposite, making the membrane more negative, moving away from the threshold, so the neuron is less likely to fire.

Looking at the options:

Option A: Says they're types of nerve cells. No, they're potentials, not cells.

Option B: Both reduce likelihood. No, because EPSP increases the likelihood.

Option C: Neurotransmitters from glial cells. No, neurotransmitters are released by neurons, and these are potentials, not chemicals.

Option D: Energy production? No, that doesn't fit what I know about EPSP and IPSP.

Option E: EPSP as inhibitory, IPSP as excitatory. That's the opposite of what I remember, so E is wrong.

Option F: Permanent vs temporary change. I think both are temporary, as they're changes in membrane potential over time, so F is incorrect.

Option G: EPSP makes more likely, IPSP less likely. This sounds right based on what I was thinking.

Option H: Proteins affecting growth. No, they're electrical potentials, not proteins or growth factors.

Option I: It says EPSP increases excitability by decreasing membrane potential. Wait, no. Excitability is about how likely the neuron is to fire. If the membrane potential becomes more positive (like from -70mV to -60mV), that's a decrease in negativity, so the membrane potential is actually increasing. Wait, no, because the resting potential is negative. So EPSP makes the cell's membrane potential less negative (more positive), moving towards threshold. So I think option I is incorrect because it says EPSP decreases membrane potential. Wait, membrane potential is usually negative. So a decrease would make it more negative, which would be inhibitory. So I is wrong.

Option J: They don't affect excitability, which is wrong because they do.

So the correct answer should be G.

The correct answer is:

G: An EPSP is an excitatory postsynaptic potential making a nerve cell more likely to fire and an IPSP is an inhibitory postsynaptic potential making it less likely to fire.

Answer: G
