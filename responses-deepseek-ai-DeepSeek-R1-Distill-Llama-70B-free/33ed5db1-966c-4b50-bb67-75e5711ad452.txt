Okay, so I've got this problem here about heat transfer from a copper plate. Hmm, let's see. The question is asking for the initial rate of heat transfer when the plate is taken out of a furnace and placed in air. The plate is 2 feet high, and the air is at 70°F with atmospheric pressure, 14.7 psia. The plate was at 220°F.

Wait, I remember that when an object is much hotter than its surroundings, the initial heat transfer is dominated by radiation and convection. But since it's a vertical plate, maybe natural convection is the main factor here. Oh right, convection involves the movement of fluid (like air) over the surface, which transfers heat away.

So I think I need to calculate the convective heat transfer. The formula I remember is Q = h * A * ΔT, where h is the convective heat transfer coefficient, A is the area, and ΔT is the temperature difference. But wait, wait, the question is about the rate, so it's probably per unit area, so the answer would be in terms of Btu/hr-ft², which matches the options given.

But wait, actually, the question says "initial rate of heat transfer," so that would be the heat flux, which is Q/A, so the units are correct as provided.

So the main thing I need is the convection heat transfer coefficient (h) for air flowing over a vertical plate. But how do I find that? Oh right, it's determined by the Nusselt number, which depends on the Grashof number and Prandtl number.

The Grashof number (Gr) is given by Gr = (g * β * ΔT * L^3) / ν², where g is acceleration due to gravity, β is the volume expansion coefficient, ΔT is the temperature difference, and L is the characteristic length (here, the height of the plate). The Prandtl number (Pr) is a property of the fluid, so for air, it's about 0.7.

Once I have Gr and Pr, I can find the Nusselt number (Nu) using the appropriate correlation for natural convection on a vertical plate. The correlation I remember is Nu = 0.67 * (Gr * Pr)^(1/4) for laminar flow, which applies when Gr * Pr is less than 1e9 or so.

Wait, but let me make sure. I think the formula is Nu = (Gr * Pr)^n, where n is about 0.25 for laminar. So yeah, that's probably the one.

But wait, maybe I should check the units and properties. Let me list out the knowns:

- Plate height, L = 2 ft = 0.6096 meters (but maybe working in inches is better? Or maybe using English units with appropriate conversions.)
Wait, air properties are probably needed at the film temperature. The film temperature is the average of the plate temperature and the ambient air temperature. So T_plate = 220°F, T_ambient = 70°F. Film temp T_film = (220 +70)/2 = 145°F. Converting to absolute temperatures: 220°F is about 680 R, 70°F is 530 R, so film temp is (680 + 530)/2 = 605 R? Wait, wait, actually, when working with air properties, we usually use Fahrenheit but convert to Rankine for calculations. So 145°F is 145 + 459.67 = 604.67 R.

So at T_film = 604.67 R, I need the properties of air. Let me list them:

- Thermal conductivity, k: I remember that at around 600 R, k for air is about 0.015 Btu/hr-ft-°F.
Wait, I think the exact value is 0.01486 or something close. Let me think, maybe 0.015 is a good approximation.
- Dynamic viscosity, μ: At 600 R, μ is about 1.33 x 10^-5 lbm/(ft·hr).
- Prandtl number, Pr: For air, it's approximately 0.7, and it doesn't vary much with temperature.
- Volume expansion coefficient, β: Since β = 1/T (in absolute units), where T is in Rankine. So β = 1/604.67 ≈ 0.001654 (1/R).

Gravity g is 32.174 ft/s².

Now, let's calculate Gr and Pr.

Gr = (g * β * ΔT * L^3) / ν²

Wait, but I need the kinematic viscosity ν. Because ν = μ / ρ. Oh wait, right. Alternatively, since Gr can be written in terms of μ, but it's easier to compute ν.

Wait, but actually, for air, I might remember the kinematic viscosity at certain temperatures. Let me think. At 70°F (ambient), ν is about 0.00016 ft²/s. But since the film temperature is 145°F, the ν would be higher. Let me see, perhaps I can use the value at the film temperature.

Alternatively, maybe I should compute ν from μ and the density. Because μ is known, and density ρ can be found from the ideal gas law.

Ideal gas law: PV = nRT → for air, R is 1716 ft·lbf/(lbmol·R). But wait, maybe it's easier to compute using density.

At standard conditions (14.7 psia and 70°F), air density is about 0.076 lbm/ft³. But since the film temperature is higher, the density would be lower. Because density is inversely proportional to absolute temperature.

So at T_film = 604.67 R, the density ρ = (P / R_specific * T). R_specific for air is 1716 ft·lbf/(lbmol·R) divided by molecular weight. Wait, wait, maybe I should think in terms of specific gas constant. For air, the specific gas constant R is 1716 / 28.97 ≈ 59.02 ft·lbf/(lbm·R).

So density ρ = P / (R * T). P is 14.7 psia, which is 14.7 lbf/in². Let's convert to consistent units.

Wait, 14.7 psi is 14.7 * 144 psf = 2116.8 lbf/ft². So,

ρ = 2116.8 / (59.02 * 604.67) 

Let me calculate the denominator: 59.02 * 604.67 ≈ 59 * 600 = 35400, but more accurately, 59.02 * 604.67 = let's compute:

59.02 * 600 = 35412, 59.02 * 4.67 ≈ 59 *4.67 ≈ 275. So total ≈ 35412 + 275 = 35687.

So ρ ≈ 2116.8 / 35687 ≈ approximately 0.0593 lbm/ft³.

Then, ν = μ / ρ. μ is 1.33e-5 lbm/(ft·hr). Wait, units are a bit tricky here. Let me convert μ to lbm/(ft·s) because ν is in ft²/s.

Wait, 1 hour is 3600 seconds, so 1.33e-5 lbm/(ft·hr) = 1.33e-5 / 3600 ≈ 3.69e-9 lbm/(ft·s).

So ν = μ / ρ = (3.69e-9 lbm/(ft·s)) / (0.0593 lbm/ft³) → 3.69e-9 / 0.0593 ≈ 6.22e-8 ft²/s.

Wait, but wait, that seems really low. Because at 70°F, ν for air is about 0.00016 ft²/s. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the unit conversion for μ.

Wait, maybe I should double-check the calculation. Let's start over:

μ at 604.67 R: I think the value is around 1.33e-5 lbm/(ft·hr). Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up the units. Another approach: at 70°F (530 R), μ for air is about 1.26e-5 lbm/(ft·hr). At higher temps, μ increases. So perhaps at 145°F (604.67 R), μ is around 1.33e-5 lbm/(ft·hr).

Wait, but perhaps it's better to take the μ in lbm/(ft·s), so 1.33e-5 lbm/(ft·hr) = 1.33e-5 / 3600 ≈ 3.69e-9 lbm/(ft·s). So yes, that's correct.

So ν = μ / ρ = 3.69e-9 / 0.0593 ≈ 6.22e-8 ft²/s. Hmm, but that seems lower than expected. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating density.

Wait, the specific gas constant R for air is 1716 ft·lbf/(lbmol·R) divided by molecular weight (28.97 lbm/lbmol) → 1716 / 28.97 ≈ 59.02 ft·lbf/(lbm·R). So that's correct.

So P is 14.7 psi(a) = 14.7 lbf/in². To convert to lbf/ft², multiply by 144 in²/ft² → 14.7 * 144 = 2116.8 lbf/ft².

So ρ = P/(R*T) = 2116.8 / (59.02 * 604.67) → let me compute denominator: 59.02 * 604.67. Let me do this more accurately.

59.02 * 600 = 35412, 59.02 * 4.67 = let's compute 59 *4=236, 59*0.67≈39.53 → total ≈ 275.53. So 35412 + 275.53 = 35687.53.

So 2116.8 / 35687.53 ≈ 0.0593 lbm/ft³.

So ν = 3.69e-9 / 0.0593 → let's compute that:

3.69e-9 / 0.0593 → approximately 6.22e-8 ft²/s.

Wait a moment, that's 6.22e-8 ft²/s. At 70°F, ν is about 0.00016 ft²/s, which is 1.6e-4 ft²/s. So 6e-8 is way smaller. That doesn't make sense. Oh wait, because 145°F is higher than 70°F, so ν should be higher than 1.6e-4. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in units again.

Alternatively, maybe I should look up the kinematic viscosity of air at 145°F. Alternatively, perhaps I should use an approximate value.

Wait, I think the kinematic viscosity of air at 100°F is about 0.000208 ft²/s, and at 200°F, it's around 0.000313 ft²/s. So at 145°F, it's about 0.00024 ft²/s. That would make more sense.

Wait, so perhaps I should use ν ≈ 0.00024 ft²/s for the film temperature of 145°F.

Alternatively, maybe I should use exact calculations. Let me see. Let's compute Pr and Gr correctly.

But perhaps using the approximate ν of 0.00024 ft²/s is better than the 6e-8 I got earlier. Because that calculation must have a mistake. Maybe I messed up the unit conversion for μ.

Wait, let's double-check the calculation of μ. So μ is given as 1.33e-5 lbm/(ft·hr). Let's convert that to lbm/(ft·s): 1.33e-5 / 3600 ≈ 3.69e-9 lbm/(ft·s). Hmm, that's correct.

But the density I found was 0.0593 lbm/ft³, which would make ν = 3.69e-9 / 0.0593 ≈ 6.22e-8 ft²/s, which is 0.0000000622 ft²/s, which is way too low. That can't be right.

Wait, no, that can't be. Because 0.0593 lbm/ft³ is the density of air at 145°F and 14.7 psia? Wait, no, wait, that's the density, correct. Because at higher temperatures, the density decreases.

Wait, but if the kinematic viscosity is ν = μ/(rho), and μ increases with temperature, and rho decreases, so ν increases. So perhaps the correct ν is higher than at 70°F.

Wait, but I'm getting a very low value. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation of rho. Let me recalculate.

Compute rho again: rho = P/(R*T).

P = 14.7 psia = 14.7 * 144 psf = 2116.8 lb/ft².

R = 1716/(28.97) ≈ 59.02 ft·lbf/(lbm·R).

T = 604.67 R.

So rho = 2116.8 / (59.02 * 604.67) → compute denominator:

59.02 * 600 = 35412, 59.02 *4.67 ≈ 275.5.

Total denominator ≈ 35412 +275.5 = 35687.5.

So rho = 2116.8 / 35687.5 ≈ 0.0593 lbm/ft³.

Yes, that's correct.

So with μ = 1.33e-5 lbm/(ft·hr) → 3.69e-9 lbm/(ft·s).

So ν = 3.69e-9 / 0.0593 → 6.22e-8 ft²/s.

Wait, but 6.22e-8 ft²/s is 0.0000000622 ft²/s, which is way lower than the expected 0.00024 ft²/s. So where's the mistake here?

Ah, wait! Oh no, I think I messed up the units for μ. Because when I look up μ for air, it's usually in centipoise. Wait, 1 centipoise is 0.0001 poise. And 1 poise is 1 dyne·s/cm². But in English units, perhaps μ is given in lbm/(ft·s) or lbm/(ft·hr).

Wait, I think I might have confused the units. Let me check the value of μ for air at 145°F.

I found a table that says at 100°F, μ is about 1.26e-5 lbm/(ft·hr), and at 200°F, it's about 1.55e-5 lbm/(ft·hr). So at 145°F, μ would be roughly 1.4e-5 lbm/(ft·hr).

So let me take μ = 1.4e-5 lbm/(ft·hr) → 1.4e-5 / 3600 ≈ 3.89e-9 lbm/(ft·s).

Then, ν = μ / rho = 3.89e-9 / 0.0593 → approximately 6.56e-8 ft²/s → 0.0000000656 ft²/s.

Wait, that's even worse. So I'm getting ν way too low, which can't be right. So perhaps I'm making a mistake in the calculation of rho.

Wait, perhaps I should compute rho using the ideal gas law correctly. Let's see, the ideal gas law is PV = mRT, where m is mass, R is specific gas constant.

Alternatively, the density rho = (P M) / (R T), where M is molecular weight.

But wait, no, for specific gas constant, R_specific = R_universal / M.

So R_universal is 1716 ft·lbf/(lbmol·R), and M for air is 28.97 lbm/lbmol.

So R_specific = 1716 / 28.97 ≈ 59.02 ft·lbf/(lbm·R).

So rho = P / (R_specific * T).

But wait, in this equation, P must be in lbf/ft², R_specific in ft·lbf/(lbm·R), and T in R.

So, yes, P is 14.7 psi → 14.7 * 144 = 2116.8 lbf/ft².

So rho = 2116.8 / (59.02 * 604.67) → as before, 0.0593 lbm/ft³.

Hmm, so that's correct.

But wait, perhaps I should instead use the kinematic viscosity in ft²/s at 145°F is around 0.00024 ft²/s, as I thought earlier. Then, perhaps it's better to proceed with that value, assuming that the exact calculation is getting too bogged down.

Alternatively, perhaps I can find Grashof number without calculating ν from μ and rho, but using a known ν. Let's proceed with ν = 0.00024 ft²/s.

So, Gr = (g * β * ΔT * L^3) / ν².

Compute each term:

g = 32.174 ft/s².

β = 1 / T_film (in R) → 1 / 604.67 ≈ 0.001654 1/R.

ΔT = T_plate - T_ambient = 220 - 70 = 150°F. But since β is in 1/R, we need ΔT in R. So 150°F = 150 + 459.67 = 609.67 R.

Wait, no, wait: the temperature difference in Gr is (Ts - T_inf) in absolute units, so yes, 609.67 R.

Wait, no, wait again. ΔT is just the difference, so it's 220°F - 70°F = 150°F, which is 150 * 9/5 = 270 K? Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, no, in absolute terms, it's (220 + 459.67) - (70 + 459.67) = 150 R. So ΔT = 150 R.

Wait, no, wait. Let me clarify: Grashof number uses the temperature difference in absolute terms, so ΔT = Ts - T_inf = 220°F - 70°F = 150°F. But 150°F in R is 150 + 459.67 = 609.67 R.

Wait, no,
