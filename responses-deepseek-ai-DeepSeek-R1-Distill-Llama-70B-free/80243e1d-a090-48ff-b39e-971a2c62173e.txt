Question:

Letâ€™s assume that the 10-year annual return for the S&P 500 (market portfolio) is 10%, while the average annual return on Treasury bills (a good proxy for the risk-free rate) is 5%. The standard deviation is 15% over a 10-year period. Whats the market Sharpe Ratio?

Options:

A: 1.50
B: 1.00
C: 0.20
D: 0.25
E: 0.50
F: 1.25
G: 0.75
H: 0.33
I: 2.00
J: 0.60

Okay, so I've got this question about the Sharpe Ratio and I need to figure it out. Hmm, what's the Sharpe Ratio again? I remember it's a measure of risk-adjusted return. Oh right, it tells you how much excess return you're getting for the extra volatility you endure by holding a riskier asset compared to a risk-free asset.

The formula, I think, is (Return of the Portfolio - Risk-Free Rate) divided by the Standard Deviation of the Portfolio's Excess Return. So Sharpe Ratio = (Market Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Standard Deviation.

Let me look at the numbers given. The S&P 500, which is the market portfolio here, has a 10-year annual return of 10%. The risk-free rate is the Treasury bill rate, averaging 5% annually. The standard deviation is 15% over the same period.

So plugging those numbers in: (10% - 5%) equals 5%. That's the numerator. The denominator is 15%. So 5 divided by 15 is 0.333... which is approximately 0.33.

Looking at the options, H is 0.33. So that should be the right answer. Wait, let me double-check the formula to make sure I didn't mix up anything. Oh yeah, it's excess return over standard deviation. Yep, that's correct.

I think I'm confident here. The answer should be H.

The Sharpe Ratio is calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Sharpe Ratio} = \frac{\text{Market Return} - \text{Risk-Free Rate}}{\text{Standard Deviation}}
\]

Given:
- Market Return = 10%
- Risk-Free Rate = 5%
- Standard Deviation = 15%

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Sharpe Ratio} = \frac{10\% - 5\%}{15\%} = \frac{5\%}{15\%} \approx 0.33
\]

From the options provided, the closest match is **H: 0.33**.

Answer: H
