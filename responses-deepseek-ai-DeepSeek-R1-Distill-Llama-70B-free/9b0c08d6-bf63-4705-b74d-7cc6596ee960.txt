Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question here about reducing bias in sample surveys. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on my statistics, but let me think through this.

The question is asking which option is least likely to reduce bias. So I need to remember what each of these methods does regarding bias.

Starting with the options:

Option A: Conducting the survey multiple times. I think this might help with reliability, making sure results are consistent. But does it reduce bias? Maybe not directly. Like, if you have the same biased sample each time, doing it multiple times wouldn't fix the bias.

Option B: Using a large, diverse population for sampling. Oh, right, a larger sample usually reduces sampling error and makes the sample more representative, which cuts down bias. Diverse population ensures different groups are included, so that's good for reducing bias.

Option C: Following up with non-respondents. Yeah, this makes sense. If some people don't respond, they might be different from those who do, leading to non-response bias. Following up can increase response rates and reduce that bias.

Option D: Ensuring anonymity. People might answer more honestly if they're anonymous, which reduces social desirability bias. So this definitely helps.

Option E: Selecting samples randomly. Random sampling is a big one because it avoids selection bias. If you don't pick randomly, you might choose people who are not representative.

Option F: Asking neutral questions. Neutral wording ensures that the questions don't influence responses in a particular direction, which avoids bias in the data collected.

Option G: Stratified sampling instead of simple random. Stratified sampling can reduce bias by ensuring that subgroups are represented proportionally. It can make the sample more representative, thus reducing bias.

Option H: Increasing sample size. Larger samples tend to have less variability, so they reduce sampling error and make estimates more precise, which relates to bias as well because a larger size often leads to a more representative sample.

Option I: Including a wide range of questions. Hmm, not sure. Maybe this could cause respondent fatigue, leading to lower response rates or less thoughtful answers. But does it reduce bias? I'm not certain. It might not directly address bias issues.

Option J: Using a non-random sampling method. Oh, definitely. Non-random methods like convenience sampling introduce more bias because the sample isn't representative of the population.

Wait, the question is which is least likely to reduce bias. So looking for the option that doesn't help much or might even increase bias.

Option I: Including many questions. I don't think it's directly related to reducing bias. It could have other effects, but maybe it doesn't address the main sources of bias like selection or response bias. So this might be the least likely.

Alternatively, Option A: Conducting the survey multiple times. Does that help with bias? Maybe not directly. It could help with seeing trends over time or testing reliability, but each survey's bias is independent. So if the first survey is biased, repeating it won't fix that.

So which is least likely? The question is about reducing bias, not reliability or variability.

Looking back:

The options that directly tackle bias are B, C, D, E, F, G, H, J. J is actually bad because non-random increases bias. So J is the worst option, but the question is which is least likely to reduce bias, so which option doesn't help.

Wait, the question is which is least likely to reduce bias. So which one is not effective in reducing bias.

So, options that don't help reduce bias:

Option I: Including a wide range of questions. Maybe it doesn't help with bias. Or perhaps it could introduce more bias if some questions are sensitive, leading to non-response. But I'm not certain.

Alternatively, option A: Conducting the survey multiple times. Suppose you do multiple surveys, each with the same biased method. That wouldn't reduce bias. For example, if each survey uses convenience sampling, doing it many times doesn't make it unbiased. So A doesn't reduce the bias inherent in each survey.

So now I'm considering which is worse, A or I.

The question is which is least likely to reduce bias. So which action doesn't contribute much to reducing bias.

Option I: Adding more questions might not affect bias. It could even cause more problems, but the option is about reducing bias. So including a wide range of questions doesn't directly address any bias issues. It's more about content than methodology.

So between I and A, which is less likely to reduce bias.

If a survey is conducted multiple times but each time uses a biased sample, then multiple times won't help. But perhaps if you conduct it once with a biased sample, and then again with a different method, but that's not what the option says. The option just says conducting it multiple times, without specifying changes. So, if the same methodology is used each time, the bias remains.

But the question is about the least likely to reduce bias. So which action doesn't help in reducing it.

Alternatively, increasing sample size (H) does help reduce bias because a larger sample is more representative.

So, looking again, the worst options in terms of not reducing bias are I and A.

Wait, the question is about which is least likely to reduce bias. So, which of the options doesn't contribute to reducing bias.

Including a wide range of questions (I) doesn't directly address any sources of bias. It might make the survey longer, which could affect response rates, but that's more about non-response bias. But the option doesn't imply anything about the questions affecting bias.

Alternatively, conducting the survey multiple times (A) might allow for testing changes over time but doesn't address the bias within each survey.

So, perhaps the least effective is option I because it doesn't target any bias reduction strategies. Or maybe option A.

Wait, another approach: think about bias in survey design. Common sources include selection bias (who is chosen), non-response bias (who responds), and measurement bias (how questions are asked).

Options that tackle these:

- E (random selection) reduces selection bias.
- C (follow-up) reduces non-response.
- F (neutral questions) reduces measurement bias.
- D (anonymity) also reduces measurement bias.
- B (diverse sampling frame) ensures better representation, reducing selection bias.
- G (stratified sampling) reduces selection bias by ensuring subgroups are included.
- H (large sample) reduces sampling error and makes bias less likely as sample is more representative.
- J (non-random is bad, increases bias)

A: Multiple times. Perhaps if each survey is independent but has the same bias, but the option doesn't say anything about the method. So, maybe conducting multiple surveys without addressing the bias doesn't reduce it. So A isn't helpful.

I: Including many questions. Not directly related to bias. Unless the questions are about diverse topics, but that's not the same as reducing bias.

So the least likely to reduce bias is I: Including a wide range of questions. Or perhaps A.

Wait, the question is about which is least likely to reduce bias. So which option doesn't help reduce bias.

Another angle: which option does not address any of the main sources of bias.

Including a wide range of questions (I) doesn't address sample selection, non-response, or question bias. So it's least likely to reduce bias.

Alternatively, conducting the survey multiple times (A) might not address the underlying bias, but it's about reliability, not bias.

So the answer would be I or A.

Wait, the options are from A to J, and the options given as possible answers are A-J, and the correct answer is one of them.

In the options, the question is which is least likely to reduce bias.

Which options are known to reduce bias:

- B: large diverse sample → reduces sampling bias.
- C: follow-up → reduces non-response.
- D: anonymity → reduces social desirability bias.
- E: random sampling → reduces selection bias.
- F: neutral questions → reduces measurement bias.
- G: stratified sampling → reduces selection bias.
- H: larger sample → reduces sampling error and bias.
- J: non-random → increases bias.

A: multiple times → not directly related to bias unless each survey is done to compare.

So, the options that do reduce bias are B, C, D, E, F, G, H. J increases bias, so it's not the answer. The question is which is least likely to reduce bias, so the worst option among those that are supposed to help.

Wait, no. The question is, which is least likely to reduce bias. So which of the options doesn't help in reducing bias.

So, the option that doesn't address bias.

Looking at the options, I think option I: including a wide range of questions. This doesn't directly address any source of bias. It might even lead to more problems, but the question is about reducing bias. So this is the least likely to help.

Alternatively, option A: conducting multiple times. If each survey has the same bias, then multiple surveys won't reduce the overall bias. So A doesn't help.

Wait, but perhaps doing multiple surveys allows you to average out some biases? Not sure. Maybe, but the option doesn't specify that they're using different methods each time.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn between A and I.

But, considering that including a wide range of questions doesn't directly tackle any specific bias issue, I think that's the answer.

So the answer is I.
</think>

To determine which option is least likely to reduce bias in a sample survey, it is important to evaluate how each option addresses sources of bias such as selection bias, non-response bias, and measurement bias.

- **Option A (Conducting the survey multiple times):** While this may improve reliability by identifying consistent trends, it does not directly reduce bias unless the methodology is adjusted to address bias in each iteration. If the same biased method is used repeatedly, bias remains.

- **Option B (Using a large, diverse population for sampling):** A large and diverse population reduces sampling error and ensures representation, directly reducing bias.

- **Option C (Following up with non-respondents):** This reduces non-response bias by increasing the likelihood of representative responses.

- **Option D (Ensuring anonymity):** Anonymity reduces social desirability bias, encouraging honest responses.

- **Option E (Selecting samples randomly):** Random sampling eliminates selection bias by ensuring every individual has an equal chance of being selected.

- **Option F (Asking questions in a neutral manner):** Neutral phrasing reduces measurement bias by avoiding influence on respondents' answers.

- **Option G (Using stratified random sampling):** This method ensures proportional representation of subgroups, reducing selection bias.

- **Option H (Increasing the sample size):** A larger sample reduces sampling error and increases representativeness, indirectly reducing bias.

- **Option I (Including a wide range of questions):** While this may provide more data, it does not directly address any specific source of bias. It could potentially introduce issues like respondent fatigue but does not inherently reduce bias.

- **Option J (Using a non-random sampling method):** Non-random sampling increases selection bias and is not effective for reducing bias.

The least likely options to reduce bias are **A** and **I**. However, **I (Including a wide range of questions)** does not directly address any specific source of bias, making it the least effective option for reducing bias.
