Okay, so I've got this transformer problem here, and I'm a bit nervous because I'm not super confident with all the transformer calculations. But I'll try to take it step by step.

Alright, the problem is about a transformer that's being used as an autotransformer. Let's read the question again to make sure I get all the details.

The transformer is rated at 10 kVA, 440/110 volts, 60 Hz, single-phase. Its efficiency is 97.5% at a rated load of unity power factor. The full-load copper loss is 150 watts, and the core loss is 100 watts. We need to find two things: part (a) is the kVA rating as a 550/440-volt autotransformer, and part (b) is the efficiency when supplying full load at 80% lagging power factor.

Wait, so the transformer is being reconfigured as an autotransformer. I remember that an autotransformer is a type where a single winding is used as both the primary and secondary, with a tap point. So part of the winding is common to both the primary and secondary circuits.

First, I think I need to find the kVA rating when it's used as an autotransformer with the new voltage ratings of 550/440 volts. Then, for part (b), calculate the efficiency under different conditions.

Let me start with part (a). 

In the original setup, the transformer is a step-down type, I think, because 440 is primary and 110 is secondary. But when used as an autotransformer, the configuration might change.

Wait, in an autotransformer, the voltage rating is the difference between the primary and secondary. Hmm, no, wait. The autotransformer has one voltage across the entire winding and another across a portion. So for a 550/440 volt autotransformer, I'm guessing that 550 is the primary (higher) voltage, and 440 is the secondary (lower), but the autotransformer uses a part of the winding. Or maybe the other way around. Wait, no, the primary would be the higher voltage, so 550 is primary, 440 is secondary. But wait, sometimes the autotransformer can be step-up or step-down, depending on the connection. Hmm.

Wait, I think the key here is to find the kVA rating when connected as an autotransformer. So the original transformer has a certain kVA rating when used as a normal transformer, but when connected as an autotransformer, the kVA rating changes based on how much of the winding is used.

Wait, the original transformer has a rating of 10 kVA. So when it's used as a normal step-down transformer, it can handle 10 kVA. But as an autotransformer, the same transformer might have a higher kVA rating because the autotransformer effectively uses more of the winding for the same voltage difference.

I remember that for an autotransformer, the rating is determined by the product of the current in the common winding and the voltage difference. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula.

Wait, the formula for the kVA of an autotransformer is similar to a regular transformer, but I think the way the voltage is applied changes. The kVA is V * I, where V is the voltage across the autotransformer, and I is the current.

Wait, let's think about the original transformer. It's a 440/110 transformer, so the primary is 440 V, secondary 110 V, with a 10 kVA rating. So the primary current is 10,000 VA / 440 V ≈ 22.727 amps. The secondary current is 10,000 / 110 ≈ 90.91 amps.

But when it's used as an autotransformer, the voltage is different. The new voltage is 550/440. So the autotransformer must have a primary voltage of 550 V, and the secondary is 440 V. Wait, but how does this relate to the original transformer's windings?

I think I need to find how much of the original winding is used in the autotransformer configuration. Autotransformers use a portion of the winding as the secondary.

Wait, the original transformer has a primary of 440 V and a secondary of 110 V. But as an autotransformer, the primary would be higher than the secondary. So 550 V as primary, 440 as secondary. The difference is 110 V, which would be the voltage across the portion of the winding used as the secondary in the autotransformer.

Wait, because the original transformer's secondary is 110 V, which is the same as the 550-440=110 V difference. So in the autotransformer setup, the 110 V part is used as the 'series' part.

In an autotransformer, the kVA rating is determined by the voltage and the current. The voltage is the difference between the primary and secondary, which is 110 V here. But wait, no, the primary is 550, and the secondary is 440, so the difference is 110 V.

Wait, the autotransformer uses part of the winding. So in the original transformer, the 110 V is the secondary. So when used as an autotransformer, the 110 V part is the portion that's tapped, and the rest (440 V) is the other part.

Wait, maybe I should think about the ratio. The autotransformer voltage ratio is (550)/(440) = 1.25. So the ratio is 5:4, meaning that 4/5 of the winding is used as the common part, and 1/5 as the other.

Wait, no, in an autotransformer, the primary is across the entire winding, and the secondary is across a portion. Alternatively, sometimes it's that the primary is across a portion, and the secondary uses the entire winding as well as a portion.

Wait, perhaps I should find the ratio of the autotransformer. Let's denote the primary voltage as V1 = 550 V, and the secondary as V2 = 440 V. The voltage difference is V1 - V2 = 110 V.

In the original transformer, the secondary voltage is 110 V when the primary is 440 V. So in the autotransformer, the 110 V portion would correspond to a certain number of turns.

Wait, the turns ratio in the original transformer was 440:110, which is 4:1. So the primary has 4 times as many turns as the secondary.

In the autotransformer setup, since the voltage difference is 110 V (same as the original secondary), the number of turns used for this part would be the same as the original secondary, which is 1 part. The total turns in the autotransformer would then be 4 parts (from the original primary) plus 1 part (from the original secondary), making 5 parts total.

Wait, no. Wait, the original primary was 4 parts (440 V), each part being 110 V. So each part is 110 V, so 4 parts are 440 V. Now, in the autotransformer setup, the primary is 550 V, and the secondary is 440 V. So the difference is 110 V. So the 110 V part would correspond to one part (as each part is 110 V). So the autotransformer uses 1 part for the lower voltage section, and the total would be 5 parts (since 4 parts are 440 V), but wait, I'm getting confused.

Alternatively, perhaps the autotransformer uses the same winding, but in a different configuration. So the original transformer has a primary of 440 V (which is 4 times 110 V) and a secondary of 110 V. So when it's used as an autotransformer, perhaps the 110 V is across a portion, and the rest is part of the primary.

Wait, perhaps I should calculate the kVA using the formula for an autotransformer. The kVA as an autotransformer can be found if I know the voltage and the current.

Wait, the autotransformer's kVA is given by V1 * I1, where I1 is the primary current, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the kVA is the same as the product of the voltage difference and the current through the winding.

Wait, in the original transformer, the full-load current on the primary side is 10,000 VA / 440 V ≈ 22.727 A. And the secondary current is 10,000 /110 ≈ 90.909 A.

But in the autotransformer setup, the current would flow differently. Let's think about it.

In an autotransformer, the primary current flows through part of the winding, and the secondary current through another part. But I'm getting stuck here.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to find the maximum kVA the transformer can handle as an autotransformer. Since the original transformer has a 10 kVA rating, but when connected as an autotransformer, the kVA would be higher because the same currents and voltages are used but in a different configuration.

Wait, I remember that the kVA of an autotransformer can be higher than that of a regular transformer using the same windings because the autotransformer only uses a portion of the winding for part of the voltage. So the formula for the kVA in an autotransformer is (V1 - V2) * I, where I is the current in the common winding.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think again.

The original transformer has a primary voltage of 440 V, secondary 110 V, and a kVA of 10.

As an autotransformer, the primary is 550 V, and the secondary is 440 V. So the voltage difference is 110 V, which is the same as the original secondary voltage.

So the autotransformer would have a turns ratio of (550/440) : 1, which is 5:4.

Wait, the turns ratio for an autotransformer is a bit different. The ratio is (n1)/(n2), where n1 is the number of turns on the primary side (which includes the common part) and n2 is the number of turns on the secondary side (the tapped part).

So for the autotransformer, the voltage per turn is the same as the original transformer. In the original transformer, the primary is 440 V, so each turn is 440 / total_turns_primary. But wait, perhaps the voltage per turn is 110 V / number_of_turns_secondary.

Wait, perhaps I should compute the number of turns. Let's let N1 be the primary turns in the original transformer, N2 the secondary. So, V1 = 440 V = N1 * V_per_turn, and V2 = 110 V = N2 * V_per_turn. So N1/N2 = 4, since 440/110=4.

So N1 = 4 N2.

In the autotransformer setup, the primary voltage is 550 V, which is across (N1 + N2') turns, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the autotransformer uses N1 turns for the higher voltage, and a portion for the lower.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to find the maximum current the transformer can handle in the autotransformer configuration.

In the original transformer, the full-load current on the primary side is 10,000 /440 ≈22.727 A. On the secondary side, it's 90.909 A.

But in the autotransformer setup, the current through the windings will depend on the voltage and the load.

Wait, the autotransformer's kVA can be calculated using the formula:

kVA = V * I,

where V is the voltage difference (550 -440 =110 V), and I is the current that the transformer can handle without exceeding its original current ratings.

Wait, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the kVA of the autotransformer would be (V1 * I1), but I1 in the autotransformer is different.

Wait, perhaps I should think about how much current the transformer can supply as an autotransformer. In the original setup, the primary current is 22.727 A. So if the autotransformer's primary is 550 V, and the primary current is still limited to 22.727 A (since the winding can't handle more), then the kVA would be 550 V * 22.727 A = 12.5 kVA. But that doesn't seem right because I thought the kVA would be higher.

Wait, perhaps that's not correct because as an autotransformer, the current through the common winding would be higher. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should calculate the kVA based on the fact that the same copper losses apply but at different currents. Alternatively, perhaps the maximum current is determined by the original secondary current.

Wait, the original secondary can handle up to 90.909 A. So if in the autotransformer, the current through that part is 90.909 A, then the kVA would be 110 V * 90.909 A ≈10 kVA. But that seems lower than expected.

Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me think about the transformer's original characteristics.

The original transformer's kVA is 10, with a primary voltage of 440 and secondary 110. So the primary current is 10,000 /440 ≈22.727 A, and secondary current is 10,000 /110 ≈90.909 A.

Full-load copper loss is 150 W. Core loss is 100 W.

Efficiency at full load and unity PF is 97.5%. So that's correct because efficiency is (output)/(input) = (10,000 - losses)/ (10,000 + losses). Wait, actually, efficiency is output / (output + losses). Because input is output plus losses.

Wait, the formula for efficiency is:

Efficiency (%) = (Output Power / (Output Power + Losses)) * 100.

At full load, output is 10,000 W (since PF is 1, so VA * PF = W). The losses are 150 W (copper) + 100 W (core) = 250 W.

So efficiency = (10,000) / (10,000 + 250) = 10,000/10,250 ≈ 0.9756 or 97.56%. Which matches the given 97.5%, close enough.

Now, when it's used as an autotransformer, the kVA rating changes. Let's think about how much current it can handle.

In the autotransformer, the voltage difference is 110 V. So the current that this part can handle is the same as the original secondary's current, which is 90.909 A. So the kVA would be 110 V * 90.909 A ≈10 kVA. But that's the same as before, which doesn't make sense because an autotransformer should have a higher kVA.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the way the autotransformer uses the windings. Let me try a different approach.

The autotransformer's kVA is determined by the product of the voltage and the current through the series winding. The series winding is the part with the 110 V. So the maximum current is determined by the original secondary's current capacity, which is 90.909 A. So the kVA would be 110 V * 90.909 A ≈10 kVA. But this seems to contradict what I thought earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps the kVA is higher because the autotransformer uses more of the transformer's capacity.

Wait, another approach: The kVA rating of the autotransformer can be found by considering the maximum possible current through the windings without exceeding the original transformer's current limits.

In the original transformer, the primary can handle up to 22.727 A before it's overloaded, and the secondary can handle up to 90.909 A.

In the autotransformer configuration, the current through the common winding (the 440 V part) would be the same as the secondary current in the original setup, which is 90.909 A. Because when it's used as an autotransformer, the 440 V is the common part, so the current through that part is determined by the load.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting mixed up. Let me try to think about the current flows.

In an autotransformer, the primary current flows through the entire winding, and the secondary current flows through a portion. Alternatively, the primary is the sum of the two, and the secondary is the difference.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to find the maximum current the autotransformer can supply.

In the autotransformer setup, the primary voltage is 550 V, and the secondary is 440 V. The difference is 110 V, which is applied across the series winding (which was the original secondary). The current in the series winding is the same as the load current on the secondary side.

So the maximum current that the series winding can handle is 90.909 A (from the original secondary's rating). Therefore, the kVA of the autotransformer would be 110 V * 90.909 A ≈10 kVA. But that seems the same as before, which can't be right.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. The original transformer's primary can handle 22.727 A, and the secondary 90.909 A. So when used as an autotransformer, the current through the common part (the 440 V part) is determined by the load. So the maximum current through the series part is 90.909 A, which would mean the kVA is 110 V * 90.909 A ≈10 kVA, but that doesn't change anything.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let me find another way.

The kVA of the autotransformer can be calculated using the formula:

kVA = (V1 * I1),

where V1 is the primary voltage (550 V), and I1 is the current in the primary.

But the primary current can't exceed the original primary's current rating, which is 22.727 A. So 550 V * 22.727 A ≈12.5 kVA.

But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach. Alternatively, perhaps the kVA as an autotransformer is higher because the same transformer can handle more load when connected as an autotransformer.

Wait, another approach: The kVA of an autotransformer is given by the formula:

kVA = (N1 / (N1 - N2)) ) * original kVA,

where N1 and N2 are the turns ratios. But I'm not certain about this formula.

Wait, in the original transformer, N1/N2 = 4, since 440/110=4.

In the autotransformer setup, the turns ratio is (N1 + N2)/N2 = 5/1? Because the primary is N
