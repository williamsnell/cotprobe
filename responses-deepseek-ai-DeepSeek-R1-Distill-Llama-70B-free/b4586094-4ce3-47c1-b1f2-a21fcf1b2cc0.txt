Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about economics, specifically on the concept of derived demand. I'm a bit rusty on my economics terms, but I'll try to think it through.

The question is asking, "What is a derived demand?" with options from A to J. I remember that derived demand isn't something I've studied in depth, but I recall it has something to do with the demand for one product being dependent on another product's demand.

Let me start by breaking down the term. "Derived" means it's coming from something else. So, derived demand probably comes from the demand for another product. I think it's when the demand for a good or service isn't for its own sake but because it's needed for another purpose.

Wait, I remember an example from when I was studying. Like, demand for tires isn't just because people want tires, but because they have cars. So the demand for tires is derived from the demand for cars. So if more cars are sold, more tires are needed. That makes sense.

Looking at the options now. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A: A demand caused by changes in weather. Hmm, like umbrellas when it rains? But that's more about factors affecting demand, not necessarily derived from another product's demand.

Option B: Directly proportional to supply. That sounds more like the law of supply, where quantity supplied increases as price increases, but that's not about derived demand.

Option C: Influenced by demographic changes. That's a factor that shifts demand curves, but not the definition of derived demand.

Option D: Demand decreases when product demand increases. That doesn't quite fit. Maybe it's talking about inverse relationships, but not sure how that ties to derived.

Option E: Creates new products. That sounds more like innovation, not derived demand.

Option F: Luxury items. That's a type of goods, not related to derived demand.

Option G: Demand due to complementary relationship. Oh, wait, complementary goods are products used together. Like, if demand for coffee goes up, demand for sugar might too. But wait, is that derived demand?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Derived demand is when the demand for a good is because it's used to produce another good. So, for example, steel is demanded because it's used in making cars. So the demand for steel is derived from the demand for cars.

Another example might be labor. The demand for workers in a factory comes from the demand for the products they make. So, if more people buy the product, the factory needs more workers, increasing the demand for labor.

So derived demand is when one product's demand is based on the demand for another product. So the correct definition should be that it's derived from the demand of a final product.

Looking back at the options, option I says, "A demand which is derived from the demand for a final product." That sounds right. Because the initial demand for the final product (like cars) leads to derived demand for components (like tires or steel).

Option G says it's due to a complementary relationship. While complementary goods do affect each other's demand, that's more about how one product's demand affects another. But derived demand is more specific, often relating to production inputs. Though I'm a bit fuzzy on the distinction.

Wait, another thought. Complementary goods are like peanut butter and jelly. When you buy more of one, you buy more of the other. But derived demand is about inputs used in production. So G might not be the best fit. For example, tires are inputs into the production of cars, so their demand is derived.

So looking at the options again:

Option G: Complementary relationship. That's more about consumer goods that go together.

Option I: Derived from demand for a final product. That aligns with the production input example.

So I think the correct answer is option I.

Derived demand refers to the demand for a product that arises because it is needed to produce another product. For example, the demand for steel is derived from the demand for cars, as steel is a key input in car manufacturing. This type of demand is not for the product's own sake but because it is required to satisfy the demand for a final product.

Analyzing the options:

- **A**: Refers to demand influenced by weather, which is unrelated to derived demand.
- **B**: Discusses proportionality to supply, which is more about supply dynamics.
- **C**: Involves demographic changes, a factor that shifts demand but doesn't define derived demand.
- **D**: Suggests an inverse relationship between demand and product demand, which doesn't fit.
- **E**: Talks about creating new products, which is about innovation, not derived demand.
- **F**: Refers to luxury goods, a category of goods, not derived demand.
- **G**: Mentions complementary products, which affect each other's demand but isn't the specific definition of derived demand.
- **H**: Refers to demand independent of others, the opposite of derived demand.
- **I**: Correctly defines derived demand as arising from the demand for a final product.
- **J**: Refers to substitutes, which is a different concept.

The correct answer is **I**, as it accurately captures the essence of derived demand being linked to the demand for a final product.
