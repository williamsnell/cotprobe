Okay, so I have this economics question to tackle, and I want to make sure I understand it correctly. Let me read it again.

The question is about my aunt who runs a small firm from her home making apple pies. She hires some friends to help her. The question is asking which situation would most likely increase her demand for labor. The options are from A to J.

Hmm, right. So, the key here is understanding what factors affect a firm's demand for labor. I remember from my economics class that the demand for labor, also known as labor demand, is derived from the demand for the goods and services the firm produces. So if the demand for the final product increases, the firm will likely hire more workers to produce more.

Let's break down the factors that influence labor demand. The main ones are:

1. **Product Demand**: If the demand for the firm's product increases, the firm will need more labor to produce more.
2. **Technology**: Changes in technology can affect how much labor is needed. For example, if machinery becomes more efficient, maybe less labor is needed, and vice versa.
3. **Wage Rates**: If wages go up, the firm might hire fewer workers because labor becomes more expensive. If wages go down, they might hire more.
4. **Prices of Other Inputs**: Like materials or capital. If the cost of other inputs changes, it could affect how much labor is needed. For example, if the price of a key material drops, production might increase, leading to more labor demand.

Now, looking at the options one by one:

**Option A: The government introduces a new tax on apple pie sales.**
- A tax on sales would likely reduce the demand for apple pies because it makes them more expensive for consumers. If people buy fewer pies, my aunt would need fewer workers, not more. So this would decrease labor demand, not increase it.

**Option B: The price of apple peelers/corers rises.**
- Apple peelers are probably a capital good used in production. If their price increases, the cost of producing pies goes up. This could lead to lower production levels, meaning less need for labor. So this might decrease labor demand, but I'm not 100% sure. It depends on how much the price affects production.

**Option C: The price of apples falls.**
- Apples are a key input in making pies. If the price of apples decreases, the cost of producing each pie goes down. This can make production more economical, possibly leading to increased production. If my aunt produces more pies, she might need to hire more workers. So this could increase her demand for labor.

**Option D: There is a sale on ovens.**
- Ovens are a capital good. If their price temporarily drops (a sale), my aunt might invest in more ovens, which could increase her capacity. More ovens could mean she can produce more pies, so she might hire more workers. But wait, sales are temporary. Does that affect her long-term labor demand? Maybe not as much as a permanent change. But it's a possibility.

**Option E: A new study reveals that apples increase your risk of cancer.**
- This would likely reduce the demand for apple pies because consumers might be scared. Lower demand for pies means less production and lower need for labor. So this would decrease labor demand.

**Option F: Your aunt’s friends start their own apple pie business.**
- If her friends start their own businesses, they might not be available to work for her anymore. So she might have to hire more workers to replace them, but wait, does that increase her demand for labor? Or does it affect the supply of labor? Because her existing workers are leaving, she might need to hire more, but that's more about the supply side. Or perhaps she can't find enough workers, which could limit her production. Hmm, not sure. But I think this would affect the supply of labor available to her, not necessarily the demand for labor. Her demand is about how many workers she wants to hire based on her production needs.

**Option G: A popular celebrity endorses a different brand of apple pie.**
- This would likely shift consumer demand away from my aunt's pies to the endorsed brand. So her sales would drop, leading her to produce less and hire fewer workers. So this decreases labor demand.

**Option H: A popular TV show features a segment on how to make apple pies at home.**
- If more people make pies at home, they might buy fewer from my aunt. This would reduce her sales, leading to lower production and less need for labor. So this would decrease labor demand.

**Option I: Your aunt decides to switch from apple pies to pumpkin pies.**
- Changing the product could affect demand. If pumpkin pies are more popular or if she can sell them at a better price, maybe her production increases. But if she switches, she might need different skills or the same number of workers, depending on the production process. Not sure if this directly increases labor demand. It depends on whether the new product requires more labor per unit than before.

**Option J: Your aunt’s friends gossip all day, slowing their dough-making process.**
- This would decrease productivity. If each worker is less productive, she might need to hire more workers to maintain the same level of production. But wait, that's assuming she wants to keep production the same. Alternatively, if productivity drops, she might produce less, so she could reduce the number of workers. Hmm, but the question is about her demand for labor. If the existing workers are less productive, she might need more workers to produce the same quantity. So this could increase her demand for labor.

Wait, let me think again. Labor demand is based on the marginal revenue product (MRP) of labor. If workers are less productive, their MRP decreases, so she would hire fewer workers. Because each additional worker contributes less to revenue. So Option J would actually decrease her demand for labor.

So now, reviewing the options again, the ones that could increase labor demand are C, D, and perhaps I.

Option C: Price of apples falls. Lower input costs could increase production, leading to higher labor demand.

Option D: Sale on ovens. More ovens could mean higher production capacity, leading to more hiring. But a sale is temporary, so maybe it's a short-term increase, but the question doesn't specify time frame.

Option I: Switching to pumpkin pies. If pumpkin pies are more labor-intensive, then yes. But if not, maybe not. It's uncertain without more info.

So between C and D. Which is more likely to increase demand for labor.

If the price of apples (a key input) falls, the marginal cost of producing each pie decreases. This makes production more profitable, so she can produce more, which requires more labor.

A sale on ovens would lower the cost of capital, but ovens are a fixed cost. Unless the sale makes her decide to expand production because she can now buy more ovens cheaper, leading to higher output and more labor needed.

But typically, labor demand is more directly affected by changes in variable costs rather than fixed costs. Apples are a variable input (she uses more apples as she makes more pies), whereas ovens are fixed (she might buy more, but each oven can produce a certain number of pies).

Wait, but if she buys more ovens because they're on sale, her capacity increases. So she can produce more pies, which would require more labor. So in that case, D could also lead to increased labor demand.

Alternatively, if the price of apples falls, her variable costs decrease, making each additional pie more profitable. So she increases production, needing more workers.

So which effect is stronger? A decrease in variable input costs (apples) would directly reduce marginal cost, leading to higher production and thus higher labor demand. A sale on ovens (capital) might lead to more investment in capital, which could either increase or decrease labor depending on whether it's labor-saving or not. But ovens are necessary for production, so more ovens could allow for more production, hence more labor.

But I'm not sure. Let me think of an example. Suppose she has 2 ovens and can produce 100 pies a week, needing 5 workers. If she buys 2 more ovens on sale, she might now be able to produce 200 pies, needing 10 workers. So yes, that would double her labor demand.

But the sale is temporary. If the price of ovens is lower now, she might invest in more, leading to higher production. So D could increase labor demand.

But which is more likely the correct answer, C or D?

The question is about which situation increases her demand for labor. So I think C is a more direct cause because lower input prices directly affect marginal cost and lead to higher production, thus higher labor demand.

Option C: The price of apples falls. This reduces her cost per pie, so she can produce more, leading to higher demand for labor.

Option D: The sale on ovens is a capital investment. If she buys more ovens, she can expand production, but this depends on her expectations of future demand. If she thinks demand is high enough, she'll invest. But the question doesn't mention anything about demand for pies increasing, so perhaps the sale itself isn't directly tied to increased demand for labor unless she decides to expand because of it.

So I think C is the better answer.

To determine which situation would most likely increase your aunt's demand for labor, it is important to analyze how each option affects the factors influencing labor demand, such as the demand for the final product, input costs, technology, and productivity. Here's the analysis of each option:

- **Option A**: A new tax on apple pie sales would increase the cost to consumers, reducing demand for pies. Lower demand for pies would decrease production and, consequently, the demand for labor. This would not increase labor demand.

- **Option B**: A rise in the price of apple peelers/corers would increase production costs. Higher costs could lead to reduced production and lower demand for labor. This would not increase labor demand.

- **Option C**: A fall in the price of apples, a key input, would reduce the marginal cost of producing pies. Lower production costs make producing additional pies more profitable, leading to increased production and, therefore, higher demand for labor. This is a strong candidate for increasing labor demand.

- **Option D**: A sale on ovens would lower the cost of capital. If your aunt invests in more ovens, her production capacity could increase, leading to higher output and potentially more labor demand. However, this depends on her expectations of future demand, and the question does not specify an increase in demand for pies. While possible, this is less directly tied to labor demand compared to Option C.

- **Option E**: A study linking apples to cancer would reduce consumer demand for apple pies. Lower demand for pies would decrease production and labor demand. This would not increase labor demand.

- **Option F**: If her friends start their own businesses, the supply of labor available to your aunt might decrease. However, this affects the supply of labor rather than the demand for labor. It does not necessarily increase her demand for labor.

- **Option G**: A celebrity endorsing a different brand would shift consumer demand away from your aunt's pies. Lower demand for her pies would reduce production and labor demand. This would not increase labor demand.

- **Option H**: A TV show featuring homemade apple pies could reduce demand for store-bought pies, including your aunt's. Lower demand would decrease production and labor demand. This would not increase labor demand.

- **Option I**: Switching from apple pies to pumpkin pies could affect labor demand depending on the production requirements of pumpkin pies. However, the question does not provide enough information to conclude that this would increase labor demand.

- **Option J**: If workers are less productive due to gossiping, their marginal revenue product would decrease, leading to lower demand for labor. This would not increase labor demand.

Between the options, **Option C** is the most direct and likely cause of increased labor demand. A fall in the price of apples reduces production costs, making it more profitable to produce additional pies, which would require more workers. While Option D could also increase labor demand, it is less directly tied to labor demand and depends on assumptions about future production expansion.

**Answer: C**
