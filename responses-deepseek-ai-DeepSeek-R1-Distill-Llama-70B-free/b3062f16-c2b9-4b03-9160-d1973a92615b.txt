Okay, I'm trying to solve this triangle problem. Let me read it again to make sure I understand. 

So, we have triangle ABC, and the sides are given as AB = 9x - 1, CB = 5x - 0.5, and AC = 4x + 1. Oh wait, and it says AC equals CB. Hmm, so AC = CB. That must mean that the lengths of sides AC and CB are equal. So in triangle ABC, sides AC and CB are equal, so it's an isosceles triangle with those two sides being equal. 

Wait, but in a triangle, the sides opposite equal angles are equal. So if AC is equal to CB, then the angles opposite those sides would be equal. But maybe I don't need that for this problem. Let me focus on what's given. 

So, the question is to find the measure of AB. AB is given as 9x -1. So to find AB, I need to find the value of x first. Because once I know x, I can plug it into the expression for AB. 

But how do I find x? Well, the problem states that AC equals CB. So I can set the expressions for AC and CB equal to each other and solve for x. 

So AC is 4x +1 and CB is 5x -0.5. Setting them equal:

4x + 1 = 5x - 0.5

Now I'll solve for x. Let me subtract 4x from both sides:

4x +1 -4x = 5x -0.5 -4x
Which simplifies to:
1 = x - 0.5

Then I'll add 0.5 to both sides to solve for x:

1 + 0.5 = x
1.5 = x

So x is 1.5. Now, I can plug this value back into the expression for AB to find its measure. 

AB is 9x -1. Substituting x = 1.5:

AB = 9*(1.5) - 1

Let me calculate 9 times 1.5. Well, 9 * 1 is 9, and 9 * 0.5 is 4.5, so together 13.5. Then subtract 1, so 13.5 - 1 = 12.5.

Wait, but looking at the options, let me check. The options are A to J. Let me look: 

A:15, B:12.5, C:10.5, D:10, E:16, F:11, G:13.5, H:9.5, I:14, J:8.

So 12.5 is option B. So the measure of AB is 12.5.

Wait a second, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So AC is 4x+1 and CB is 5x-0.5. Setting them equal:

4x +1 = 5x -0.5

Subtract 4x: 1 = x - 0.5

Add 0.5: 1.5 = x. That seems correct.

Then AB is 9x -1. So 9*(1.5) is 13.5, minus 1 is 12.5. Yep, that's correct.

So the answer should be B:12.5.

To solve the problem, we start by noting that in triangle ABC, sides AC and CB are equal, making it an isosceles triangle. The given expressions for the sides are:

- \( AB = 9x - 1 \)
- \( CB = 5x - 0.5 \)
- \( AC = 4x + 1 \)

Since \( AC = CB \), we set their expressions equal to each other:

\[
4x + 1 = 5x - 0.5
\]

Solving for \( x \):

1. Subtract \( 4x \) from both sides:
   \[
   1 = x - 0.5
   \]
2. Add \( 0.5 \) to both sides:
   \[
   x = 1.5
   \]

Now, substitute \( x = 1.5 \) into the expression for \( AB \):

\[
AB = 9x - 1 = 9(1.5) - 1 = 13.5 - 1 = 12.5
\]

Thus, the measure of \( AB \) is 12.5, which corresponds to option **B**.
