Question:

Draw one card at random from a standard deck of cards. The sample space $S$ is the collection of the 52 cards. Assume that the probability set function assigns $1 / 52$ to each of the 52 outcomes. Let
$$
\begin{aligned}
A & =\{x: x \text { is a jack, queen, or king }\}, \\
B & =\{x: x \text { is a } 9,10, \text { or jack and } x \text { is red }\}, \\
C & =\{x: x \text { is a club }\}, \\
D & =\{x: x \text { is a diamond, a heart, or a spade }\} .
\end{aligned}
$$
Find $P(A)$

Options:

A: $\frac{14}{52}$
B: $\frac{12}{52}$
C: $\frac{13}{52}$
D: $\frac{15}{52}$
E: $\frac{10}{52}$
F: $\frac{7}{52}$
G: $\frac{11}{52}$
H: $\frac{9}{52}$
I: $\frac{8}{52}$
J: $\frac{16}{52}$

Okay, so I have this probability problem here, and I need to find P(A), which is the probability of event A occurring. Let me see what the problem says.

Alright, the sample space S consists of all 52 cards in a standard deck. Each outcome has an equal probability, so each card has a 1/52 chance. Got that.

Now, the events are defined as:

A is the set of all cards that are a Jack, Queen, or King. So I need to count how many such cards there are.

B is about 9, 10, or Jack and being red. But I don't need to worry about B for this question since the question is only about A.

C is about clubs, and D is about diamonds, hearts, or spades. Again, not relevant for finding P(A).

So focusing on A: how many cards are Jacks, Queens, or Kings in a deck?

I remember that in a standard deck, each suit has 13 cards. The face cards are Jack, Queen, King, and Ace. Wait, no, sometimes Ace is considered separately. But in this case, A is only Jack, Queen, King. So each suit has 3 such cards.

There are 4 suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades. So each suit contributes 3 cards to event A. So 3 cards per suit times 4 suits = 12 cards total.

Wait, wait. Let me double-check. Each suit has Jack, Queen, Kingâ€”so that's 3 per suit. 4 suits would make 3*4=12. So A has 12 cards.

Therefore, the probability P(A) is the number of favorable outcomes over the total number of possible outcomes. That's 12/52. 

Looking at the options, option B is 12/52. So the correct answer should be B.

To determine \( P(A) \), we analyze event \( A \), which is defined as the set of all cards that are a Jack, Queen, or King. In a standard deck of 52 cards, each suit (hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades) contains 3 such face cards: one Jack, one Queen, and one King. Since there are 4 suits, the total number of favorable outcomes is:

\[
3 \, \text{face cards per suit} \times 4 \, \text{suits} = 12 \, \text{face cards}.
\]

The probability \( P(A) \) is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:

\[
P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{12}{52}.
\]

From the given options, the correct answer is:

**B: \(\frac{12}{52}\)**.
