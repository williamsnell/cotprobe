The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Landowner's property was landlocked. He had to go to court to ask the court to compel the adjacent landowner to give him an easement of necessity for ingress and egress to the highway. The court granted the easement of necessity to Landowner. Over a decade later, another access route to the highway opened up through public improvements. The adjacent landowner sued to stop Landowner from continuing to use his land for ingress and egress. What will the court most likely rule in this case?

Options:

A: The easement is terminated because it cannot exceed five years in length, without being formally renewed by both parties.
B: The easement is terminated because the landowner did not pay for its use.
C: The easement continues because it was granted by the court.
D: The holder of the easement has a right to insist on its uninterrupted continuance.
E: The easement should be modified, not terminated, because the new route may not always be available.
F: The equities favor the termination of the easement where another route is available.
G: The court will most likely rule in favor of the landowner as he has used the easement for over a decade.
H: The easement will continue until the holder of the easement chooses to release it.
I: The easement continues because its purpose of access to the property still exists.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this easement question. Let me start by understanding what the question is about. 

So, there's a landowner whose property is landlocked, meaning it doesn't have direct access to a public road or highway. He went to court and got an easement of necessity from the adjacent landowner. An easement of necessity is typically granted when it's the only way to access the land, so it's usually implied or court-ordered when a property is landlocked.

The easement was granted over a decade ago, and now a new public access route has opened up. The adjacent landowner is suing to stop the landowner from using the easement anymore. The question is, what will the court decide?

First, I need to recall the law regarding easements of necessity. From what I remember, an easement of necessity is based on necessity at the time it's created. So if the necessity no longer exists, the easement might be terminated.

Wait, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me think. Easements can be terminated if the purpose for which they were created no longer exists. For example, if the easement was for access to a well and the well runs dry, the easement might end. Similarly, if another access route becomes available, maybe that affects the necessity.

In this case, a new public improvement provides another access route. So the original necessity might no longer exist because the landowner can now use this new route. But is that enough to terminate the easement?

Looking at the options, let's go through them one by one.

Option A says the easement can't exceed five years without renewal. I don't think that's a general rule. Easements can be perpetual unless specified otherwise, so A seems unlikely.

Option B suggests termination because the landowner didn't pay. But the question doesn't mention payment being an issue, so B doesn't seem relevant here.

Option C says the easement continues because it was court-ordered. But court-granted easements can still be terminated if the conditions change, like the necessity ending. So I'm not sure C is correct.

Option D states the holder can insist on its continuance. That might be true in some cases, but if the necessity is gone, maybe not. I'm not certain.

Option E suggests modifying, not terminating, because the new route might not always be available. That's possible, but the question is about termination, not modification. Also, the new route is a public improvement, which is likely more reliable.

Option F says the equities favor termination because another route is available. This sounds plausible because if there's another way, it's fair to the adjacent landowner to stop the easement.

Option G says the court will rule for the landowner because he used it for over a decade. But the duration of use doesn't necessarily mean it can't be terminated if the necessity ends.

Option H claims the easement continues until the holder releases it. That doesn't sound right because easements can be terminated by change in necessity regardless of the holder's action.

Option I states the easement continues because the purpose of access still exists. Wait, but the purpose was access. Now there's another access point, so the original easement's necessity is gone. Therefore, the purpose (access) is still served, but through a different means. So maybe I is incorrect.

Wait, but the purpose of the easement was to provide access where none existed. If another access is available, the necessity ends. So the easement can be terminated because the necessity no longer exists. So the adjacent landowner might win.

Looking back at the options, F says the equities favor termination because another route is available. That makes sense. Courts consider the equities, and if another access is available, it's equitable to end the burden on the adjacent landowner.

I think the correct answer is F. But wait, another thought: sometimes, even if another route exists, the easement might not automatically terminate unless it's explicitly based on necessity. Since this was an easement of necessity, it's tied to the necessity. Once the necessity ends, the easement can be terminated.

So the court would likely side with the adjacent landowner, terminating the easement because the necessity no longer exists. Therefore, the answer is F.

The question revolves around whether an easement of necessity, granted to a landowner to access a highway, can be terminated when a new public access route becomes available. An easement of necessity is typically granted when a property is landlocked, and there is no other way to access it. However, if the necessity ceases to exist—such as when an alternative access route is created—the easement may be terminated.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A** is incorrect because there is no rule limiting easements to five years unless explicitly stated.
- **Option B** is irrelevant since the question does not raise payment as an issue.
- **Option C** is incorrect because court-granted easements can still be terminated if the underlying necessity no longer exists.
- **Option D** is unlikely because the holder’s right to continuance depends on the ongoing necessity, which has ended.
- **Option E** suggests modification rather than termination, but the question focuses on termination, and the new public route is likely reliable.
- **Option F** is plausible because the availability of another route makes it equitable to terminate the easement, relieving the burden on the adjacent landowner.
- **Option G** is incorrect because the duration of use does not override the cessation of necessity.
- **Option H** is incorrect because easements can be terminated due to changed circumstances, regardless of the holder’s actions.
- **Option I** is incorrect because the original necessity (access) is now met through the new route, so the easement is no longer necessary.

The most likely ruling is that the court will terminate the easement because the necessity no longer exists, and the equities favor the adjacent landowner now that an alternative access route is available.
