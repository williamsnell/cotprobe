Okay, so I have this question about reinforcement schedules in psychology. I'm a bit rusty on this, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

The question is about an ice cream parlor where you get a stamp on your card each time you buy something. Once you've purchased ten items, you get the next one free. So the question is asking which reinforcement schedule this scenario describes.

Alright, reinforcement schedules are part of operant conditioning, which I remember involves rewards and punishments to modify behavior. The main types are continuous, fixed-ratio, variable-ratio, fixed-interval, variable-interval, and so on.

Hmm. The key here is to figure out what kind of schedule is being used. The customer gets a free item after ten purchases. So the free item is the reinforcement, right?

Let me break it down. So for every ten ice creams bought, the next one is free. That means the customer has to purchase ten to get one free. So the ratio here is 10:1. Every tenth purchase gives a reward.

Wait, I think ratio schedules are based on the number of responses, whereas interval schedules are based on time. So here, it's about the number of purchases, so ratio makes sense.

Now, ratio can be fixed or variable. Fixed-ratio is when the reward comes after a set number of responses. Like, every ten purchases, you get a reward. That seems to fit here because it's a consistent ten-to-one ratio.

On the other hand, variable-ratio would mean the number varies each time, like gambling where you don't know when you'll hit the jackpot. But in this case, it's always ten, so fixed.

So putting it together, the reinforcement schedule here is fixed-ratio. The correct option would be E: Fixed-ratio.

Wait, let me double-check. Continuous reinforcement is every response, which is not the case here. Fixed-interval is like getting a reward after a certain time period, like every two hours. So that's not it either. Variable-interval would be rewards at unpredictable time intervals, which doesn't fit.

So yes, the answer should be E.

The question involves determining the reinforcement schedule used by an ice cream parlor where customers receive a free item after purchasing ten items. This scenario describes a fixed-ratio schedule because the reinforcement (free item) is provided after a consistent and predictable number of responses (ten purchases). Fixed-ratio schedules are characterized by a set ratio of responses to rewards, which aligns with the "buy ten, get one free" policy. Other schedules, such as variable-ratio, fixed-interval, or continuous reinforcement, do not fit this scenario because they involve unpredictable ratios, time-based intervals, or rewards for every response, respectively. Therefore, the correct answer is:

E: Fixed-ratio
