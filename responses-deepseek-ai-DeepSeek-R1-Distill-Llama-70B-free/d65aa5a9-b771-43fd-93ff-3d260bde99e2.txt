Okay, so I've got this logic question here, and I need to figure out the right answer. Let me try to break it down step by step.

The question is about identifying a fallacy in an argument. The statement given is: "We must assume that he is a Communist, because he says that he is not, and we know that Communists are taught always to deny party membership." The options are A through D, each representing different logical fallacies.

First, I need to understand what each of these fallacies means. Let me recall them:

A: Argument from Ignorance (Argumentum ad Ignorantiam) – This is when someone assumes something is true because it hasn't been proven false, or vice versa. Like saying, "There's no proof that UFOs aren't real, so they must be real."

B: Affirming the Consequent – This is a type of logical fallacy where the argument takes the form: If P then Q. Q is true, therefore P is true. For example, "If it's raining, the ground is wet. The ground is wet, so it must be raining." But maybe someone spilled water, so it's not necessarily raining.

C: Denying the Antecedent – This fallacy occurs when the argument is If P then Q, and someone concludes that if not P, then not Q. Example: "If I study, I'll pass. I didn't study, so I won't pass." But maybe they could pass without studying.

D: Begging the Question (Petitio Principii) – This is when the argument assumes the truth of the conclusion it's trying to prove. It's like saying, "God exists because the Bible says so, and the Bible is true because it's the word of God."

Now, looking at the statement in the question: The argument is that the person must be a Communist because he denies being one, and Communists are taught to deny membership. So, the structure seems to be: If someone is a Communist, they deny being a member. He denies being a Communist, so he must be one.

Wait, but that doesn't directly fit any of the standard forms. Let me think again. The argument is using the denial as evidence of membership, based on the premise that Communists deny it. So, the argument is: All Communists deny being Communists. He denies being a Communist, therefore he is a Communist.

In logical terms, let's represent this. Let P be "He is a Communist" and Q be "He denies being a Communist." So the premise is P → Q (If he is a Communist, then he denies it). The argument then observes Q (he denies it) and concludes P (he is a Communist). So the structure is P → Q, Q therefore P. 

Wait, that's actually the Affirming the Consequent fallacy. Because the argument starts with P→Q and then from Q concludes P. That's not logically valid. Because just because P implies Q, Q doesn't necessarily imply P. There could be other reasons why Q is true.

So the fallacy here is Affirming the Consequent, which would be option B. But wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing things up.

Alternatively, another approach: The argument assumes that only Communists deny being Communists. But what if non-Communists also deny being Communists? Then the denial doesn't necessarily mean they're Communists. But the given reasoning is assuming that denial implies membership, which is based on the premise that Communists deny it. So the argument is using the fact that they deny it as proof they are Communists, which might be circular.

Wait, could this be Begging the Question? Because the conclusion is that he is a Communist, and the premise is that Communists deny it. But the argument uses the denial as evidence, assuming that only Communists would deny. But maybe that's not necessarily the case. Hmm, perhaps not. Because the premise doesn't assume he's a Communist; it's about the behavior of Communists.

Wait, no, Begging the Question would be if the argument assumes what it's trying to prove. For example, if the argument starts by assuming he's a Communist to explain why he's denying it. But in this case, the argument is using the denial as evidence, based on the premise about Communist behavior. So maybe it's not Begging the Question.

Alternatively, maybe it's an Argument from Ignorance. Because it's assuming that since he's denying it (and we have no evidence he is), he must be. But I'm not sure that's the case here.

Wait, another angle: The argument's structure is:

Premise 1: All Communists deny being Communists.
Premise 2: He denies being a Communist.
Conclusion: Therefore, he is a Communist.

This is a deductive argument, but it's logically invalid because it's committing the fallacy of Affirming the Consequent. Because in a conditional statement, if P implies Q, you can't infer P from Q unless you have a biconditional (if and only if). So, the argument is P → Q, Q is true, so P is true. That's the Affirming the Consequent fallacy.

So the correct answer should be B: Affirming the Consequent.

The question involves identifying the logical fallacy in the argument: "We must assume that he is a Communist, because he says that he is not, and we know that Communists are taught always to deny party membership." 

To analyze this, we break down the argument:

1. **Premise 1**: If someone is a Communist (P), they deny being a Communist (Q). This can be represented logically as \( P \rightarrow Q \).
2. **Premise 2**: He denies being a Communist (\( Q \) is true).
3. **Conclusion**: Therefore, he is a Communist (\( P \) is true).

The argument assumes that because \( P \rightarrow Q \) is true and \( Q \) is observed, \( P \) must also be true. This is a classic example of the **Affirming the Consequent** fallacy. In logic, \( P \rightarrow Q \) does not allow us to infer \( P \) from \( Q \) unless the statement is biconditional (i.e., \( P \) if and only if \( Q \)). Since the argument does not establish that only Communists deny being Communists, it is invalid to conclude that he is a Communist solely based on his denial.

Other options are less fitting:
- **Argument from Ignorance** involves assuming something is true because it has not been proven false, which is not the case here.
- **Denying the Antecedent** involves rejecting the premise of a conditional statement, which does not apply to this structure.
- **Begging the Question** involves assuming the truth of the conclusion one is trying to prove, but this argument does not explicitly assume he is a Communist to prove it.

Thus, the fallacy in the argument is **Affirming the Consequent**.
