Question:

Ann owns a tract of land. On August 1,2005, Ann sells to Hunter and Willa, a husband and wife, an undivided one-half interest in this land for $100,000 (the entire consideration being paid by Hunter). The deed to Hunter and Willa reads as follows: "To Hunger and Willa and their heirs as tenants by the entirety, and not as joint tenants, and not as tenants in common. "On August 1, 2006, Ann sells her remaining interest in the tract of land to Hunter and Brandon, his brother, for $125,000 (Hunter pays $80,000 of the purchase price, and Brandon pays the balance). The deed to Hunter and Brandon provides: "To Hunter and Brandon and their heirs as joint tenants and not as tenants in common. "On August 1, 2007, Hunter, Willa, and Brandon die in a common disaster, and as a consequence, the order of their deaths cannot be established by proof. Hunter's will and Willa's will devise whatever interest in the land in question that is subject to disposition by their wills to their son. Thus, the son owns

Okay, so I have this question about property ownership and what happens when people die. Hmm, let me try to break it down step by step.

First, Ann owns a tract of land. On August 1, 2005, she sells an undivided half interest to Hunter and Willa, who are husband and wife. The deed says they own it as tenants by the entirety, not joint tenants or tenants in common. Oh right, tenants by the entirety is a form of ownership that's only for married couples, and they own the property together as a single unit. So each of them doesn't own a separate share; it's more like they both own the whole thing together.

Then, on August 1, 2006, Ann sells her remaining half interest to Hunter and Brandon, his brother. The deed here says they are joint tenants, not tenants in common. Joint tenants have equal shares, with the right of survivorship. So if one dies, the other gets their share.

Now, the tricky part is when all three—Hunter, Willa, and Brandon—die in a common disaster on August 1, 2007. The order of their deaths can't be established. So we don't know who died first.

I need to figure out what each person owned at the time of their death and how that affects what the son inherits.

Let me outline what each person had:

1. From the first sale (2005), Hunter and Willa own an undivided 1/2 interest as tenants by the entirety. So together, they have half the land. Each of them doesn't individually own a specific part; they own it as a whole.

2. From the second sale (2006), Hunter and Brandon own the other half as joint tenants. So each of them owns 25% of the entire land as joint tenants? Wait, wait. No, because the entire tract is 100%, and the first sale was half, so the second sale is the other half. So the joint tenancy is for the remaining 50% between Hunter and Brandon. So each has a 25% interest in the entire land as joint tenants.

Wait, no. Because when you have joint tenants, each has an equal share. So if the entire tract is split into half, and the second sale is of the other half to Hunter and Brandon as joint tenants, each owns 25% of the entire tract (since each has half of the 50% interest). So Hunter has 25% as joint tenant with Brandon, and Willa, through the tenancy by the entirety, owns the other 50% together with Hunter.

Wait, but wait—tenancy by the entirety is for the first 50%. So in that first sale, the 50% is owned by Hunter and Willa as tenants by the entirety. So they each don't have a specific percentage, but together own 50%. Then, the second sale is another 50% to Hunter and Brandon as joint tenants. So each of them (Hunter and Brandon) own 25% of the entire tract as joint tenants.

So, at the time of their deaths in 2007, what do they each have?

Hunter has two interests:

- 50% as a tenant by the entirety with Willa.
- 25% as a joint tenant with Brandon.

Wait, but when Hunter and Brandon are joint tenants, each has a 50% interest in that particular 50% portion. So the second sale transfers 50% to Hunter and Brandon as joint tenants. So each of them has an equal share in that 50%, so 25% each of the entire tract.

Wait, no. Because if you have a 50% interest and it's held as joint tenants between two people, each owns 25% of the entire tract. Because 50% divided by two is 25% each.

So, putting it all together:

- The first 50% (from 2005) is owned by Hunter and Willa as tenants by the entirety. So together, they have that 50%, but individually, they don't have a specific percentage. If one dies, the other gets the entire 50%.

- The second 50% (from 2006) is owned by Hunter and Brandon as joint tenants, each with 25% of the entire tract.

Now, all three die. The order is unknown. So we have to consider the possible scenarios.

First, let's think about the 50% tenancy by the entirety (Hunter and Willa). If one spouse dies, the survivor gets the entire 50%. But if they both die, and it's not known who died first, the law usually presumes that the older person died first. But the question doesn't mention their ages. Hmm, maybe that's a point. But without that info, perhaps we consider that if they died simultaneously, their interests pass to each other. Wait, but if both die, then what happens?

Wait, in a tenancy by the entirety, if both spouses die in a common disaster, the survivor is determined by the order of death. If the order can't be determined, each is considered to have predeceased the other. So in that case, each spouse's interest passes to their respective estates, which would go according to their wills.

Wait, that's a bit confusing. So if both spouses die and it's unclear who died first, the law treats them as having died at the same time. For the tenancy by the entirety, this would result in each spouse's interest passing to their own estate. So each of their 50% would go to their respective heirs.

But wait, in a tenancy by the entirety, each spouse is considered to own the entire property. So when one dies, the other gets it all. But if both die, and it's not known who died first, the law has to make a decision. I think in such cases, each is deemed to have survived the other for the purpose of their own estate. So the 50% tenancy would be split into their individual estates. So each would have a 25% interest (half of the 50%) going to their estate. Wait, not sure. Alternatively, maybe each is considered to have died first, so each gets the other's share, but that can't happen.

Wait, perhaps in this situation, the tenancy by the entirety would convert into a tenancy in common between their estates. So the 50% would be split equally between their estates. So each estate would get 25% of the entire tract.

But I'm not entirely certain. Alternatively, maybe the entire 50% would pass to each of their estates. But that can't be right because that would duplicate.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is that upon the simultaneous deaths, the tenancy by the entirety would end, and each spouse's share would pass according to their will. But in a tenancy by the entirety, each spouse owns the entirety, so upon simultaneous death, each spouse is treated as owning the entirety, so each would have their entire 50% passing to their estate.

Wait, no, that can't be. Because the 50% is a single undivided interest. It can't be split into two 50% interests.

Hmm, perhaps the way to look at it is that each spouse has a right of survivorship. If they die together, then the property goes to their respective estates. So the 50% tenancy by the entirety would be divided equally between their estates. So each estate would get 25% of the entire tract.

So, from the tenancy by the entirety, each spouse's estate would receive 25%.

Now, moving on to the joint tenancy between Hunter and Brandon. Each owned 25% of the entire tract as joint tenants. If one dies, the other gets their share. But if both die, and the order isn't known, then it's similar to the tenancy by the entirety situation.

In joint tenancy, if two joint tenants die in a common disaster, the property is split between their estates, each getting half of the joint tenancy interest. So the 50% that was held in joint tenancy between Hunter and Brandon would be split. Each of their estates would get 25% of the entire tract.

Wait, no. Because the joint tenancy was for the 50% interest. So if both die, it's treated as each having died first, so each would take the other's share. But if the order can't be determined, then the joint tenancy becomes a tenancy in common, each owning half of the 50% interest. So each estate would get 25% of the entire tract.

Wait, but in joint tenancy, the right of survivorship applies. If both die, and the order is unknown, the law typically splits the property equally between the two estates. So the 50% joint tenancy would be split into two 25% interests, each going to the respective estates.

So, for the joint tenancy part: each estate (Hunter's and Brandon's) gets 25% of the entire tract.

Now, let's tally up what each person's estate gets.

Hunter's estate:

- From the tenancy by the entirety: 25% (as his estate gets half of the 50% interest).
- From the joint tenancy: 25% (his share of the 50% joint tenancy, which upon his death, would go to his estate because Brandon also died, so the right of survivorship can't apply).

Wait, no. Wait, in the joint tenancy, if both Hunter and Brandon die, then each of their shares would go to their estates. So the 50% is split, each estate gets 25%.

So, Hunter's estate gets 25% from the tenancy by the entirety (as each estate gets 25%, because the tenancy by the entirety was 50%, split between the two estates) and 25% from the joint tenancy (his half of the 50% joint tenancy).

So total for Hunter's estate: 25% + 25% = 50%.

Brandon's estate:

- From the joint tenancy: 25% (his half of the 50%).

But what about Brandon's interest? Wait, Brandon isn't married to Willa, so he doesn't have any interest in the tenancy by the entirety. He only has the joint tenancy with Hunter.

So Brandon's estate gets 25% from the joint tenancy.

Willa's estate:

- From the tenancy by the entirety: 25% (as her estate gets half of the 50%).

So, Willa's estate gets 25%.

Now, what about the son? The son is the beneficiary of both Hunter's and Willa's wills.

So, the son would receive whatever interest is in Hunter's estate and Willa's estate.

Hunter's estate has 50% (25% +25%) and Willa's estate has 25%.

So the son would get 50% +25% =75%?

Wait, but wait. Let me re-express this.

After the deaths:

- The tenancy by the entirety (50%) is split into 25% to Hunter's estate and 25% to Willa's estate.

- The joint tenancy (50%) is split into 25% to Hunter's estate and 25% to Brandon's estate.

So, the entire tract is now owned as follows:

Hunter's estate: 25% (from tenancy by entirety) +25% (from joint tenancy) =50%

Willa's estate:25% (from tenancy by entirety)

Brandon's estate:25% (from joint tenancy)

So, the son is the beneficiary of Hunter's will and Willa's will. So the son would get:

From Hunter's estate:50%

From Willa's estate:25%

So total 75%.

Wait, but wait, the question says that the son owns whatever interest is subject to disposition by their wills. So that would be the interests that were in their estates.

So the son would have 50% +25%=75%.

Wait, but looking at the options, I don't see a 75% option. Let me check the options again.

Options:

A: 1/4 (25%)

B:1/2 (50%)

C:1/3 (~33%)

D:5/6 (~83%)

E: Entire

F: None

G:1/5 (20%)

H: 3/4 (75%)

I:3/5 (60%)

J:2/3 (~66.6%)

So option H is 3/4, which is 75%.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Let me reconstruct:

Ann sells half to Hunter and Willa as tenants by entirety. So together, they have 50% of the land.

Then, the other half is sold to Hunter and Brandon as joint tenants. So each has 25% in that half (so 25% each of the entire tract).

So, upon the deaths:

1. Tenancy by entirety (50%):

Since Hunter and Willa die together, their estates each get 25% of the entire tract.

2. Joint tenancy (50%):

Hunter and Brandon die together, so their estates each get 25% of the entire tract.

So Hunter's estate gets 25% (from tenancy by entirety) +25% (from joint tenancy) =50%.

Willa's estate gets 25% (from tenancy by entirety).

Brandon's estate gets 25% (from joint tenancy).

The son inherits from Hunter's estate (50%) and Willa's estate (25%). So 75% total.

So answer H, undivided three-quarters interest.

Wait, but let me think again. Because when Hunter and Brandon are joint tenants, each has a 25% interest. Upon their simultaneous death, each estate would get 25%. So that's correct.

Yes, so the son gets 50% (Hunter's estate) and 25% (Willa's estate), totaling 75%. So the correct answer is H.
</think>

Ann initially owns a tract of land. On August 1, 2005, she sells an undivided 50% interest to Hunter and Willa, a married couple, as tenants by the entirety. This means they together own the 50% interest as a single unit, with no individual shares. On August 1, 2006, Ann sells the remaining 50% interest to Hunter and Brandon, his brother, as joint tenants with the right of survivorship. As joint tenants, Hunter and Brandon each own a 25% interest in the entire tract.

On August 1, 2007, Hunter, Willa, and Brandon die in a common disaster, and the order of their deaths cannot be established. The following rules apply:

1. **Tenancy by the Entirety (50% interest):**  
   Hunter and Willa own this 50% interest together. If both spouses die in a common disaster and the order of death cannot be determined, the law treats each as having predeceased the other. As a result, the 50% interest is split equally between their estates, with each estate receiving 25% of the entire tract.

2. **Joint Tenancy (50% interest):**  
   Hunter and Brandon own this 50% interest as joint tenants. If both joint tenants die in a common disaster and the order of death cannot be determined, the joint tenancy is severed, and the 50% interest is split equally between their estates. Each estate receives 25% of the entire tract.

After these deaths, the ownership of the tract is as follows:

- **Hunter's Estate:** Receives 25% from the tenancy by the entirety and 25% from the joint tenancy, totaling 50%.
- **Willa's Estate:** Receives 25% from the tenancy by the entirety.
- **Brandon's Estate:** Receives 25% from the joint tenancy.

The son is the beneficiary of both Hunter's and Willa's wills. Therefore, the son inherits the interests from Hunter's estate (50%) and Willa's estate (25%), resulting in a total ownership of 75% of the tract.

The correct answer is:

**H: an undivided three-quarters interest in the land.**
