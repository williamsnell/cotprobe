Okay, so I've got this math problem here that I need to solve. Let me read it again to make sure I understand it properly. 

John is playing a game where he has to place the symbols plus, times, and minus between four numbers: 2, 4, 6, and 8. He must use each symbol exactly once, and he can't use parentheses or rearrange the numbers. The goal is to get the highest possible number. The options are given from A to J, and I need to figure out which one is the correct answer.

Hmm, so the setup is 2 _ 4 _ 6 _ 8. John has to place +, ×, and - in those blanks, each used once. So I need to try all possible combinations of these operations to see which gives the highest result.

Wait, but there are three operations and three blanks, so the number of possible permutations is 3! which is 6. So I need to evaluate all six possible ways to insert the symbols and calculate the results, then pick the highest one.

Let me list out all the possible permutations of the operations. The operations are plus, times, minus. So the permutations are:

1. +, ×, -
2. +, -, ×
3. ×, +, -
4. ×, -, +
5. -, +, ×
6. -, ×, +

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of all possible orders. Alternatively, perhaps it's easier to consider each position and which operator can go there, but considering that each operator is used exactly once. So each permutation is a unique order of the three operators.

Now, for each permutation, I'll apply the operations in order and compute the result. Let me go through each case.

First permutation: +, ×, -

So the expression becomes 2 + 4 × 6 - 8.

Wait, wait a second. Wait, in math operations, multiplication comes before addition and subtraction. So I have to follow the order of operations, right? So for any expression, I do the multiplication first, then addition and subtraction from left to right.

So let's compute 2 + 4 × 6 - 8.

First, 4 × 6 is 24. So now it's 2 + 24 - 8. Then 2 + 24 is 26, minus 8 is 18. So that's 18.

Second permutation: +, -, ×

Expression: 2 + 4 - 6 × 8.

Again, multiplication first. 6 ×8 is 48. So 2 +4 is 6, minus 48. 6 -48 is -42. That's worse, so not the maximum.

Third permutation: ×, +, -

Expression: 2 ×4 +6 -8.

Compute 2×4 first, which is 8. Then 8 +6 is 14, minus 8 is 6. So 6, which is lower than 18.

Fourth permutation: ×, -, +

Expression: 2 ×4 -6 +8.

Compute 2×4 is 8. Then 8-6 is 2, plus 8 is 10. So 10, still lower than 18.

Fifth permutation: -, +, ×

Expression: 2 -4 +6 ×8.

Multiplication first: 6×8=48. Then 2-4 is -2, plus 48 is 46. Oh, that's higher than 18. So 46 is a candidate.

Sixth permutation: -, ×, +

Expression: 2 -4 ×6 +8.

Wait, let's compute that. First, 4×6 is 24. So 2 -24 is -22, plus 8 is -14. That's worse.

Wait, but wait a minute. Did I consider all permutations correctly? Let me double-check.

Wait, in the fifth permutation, the expression is 2 -4 +6 ×8. So 6×8 is 48. Then 2-4 is -2, plus 48 is 46. So that's correct.

Now, are there any other permutations? Wait, I think I've covered all 6. So the results I got are:

1. 18

2. -42

3. 6

4. 10

5. 46

6. -14

So the highest among these is 46. But wait, the options given include 46 as option F, but perhaps I made a mistake because I remember seeing higher numbers in the options. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps I missed some permutations or there's a way to get a higher number. Let me try another approach. Maybe I can try different operator placements to maximize the result.

Wait, perhaps I should consider that multiplication can lead to higher numbers, so placing multiplication in a position that affects larger numbers would help. For example, if I can multiply 6 and 8 together, that's 48, which is a big number. Then if I can add that to something else, that's good.

So let's see. Let me think about the possible operator placements again.

Option 1: 2 +4 ×6 -8 → as before, 2 +24 -8= 18.

Option 2: 2 +4 -6 ×8 → 2+4=6; 6×8=48; 6-48=-42.

Option 3: 2×4 +6 -8 → 8+6=14; 14-8=6.

Option 4: 2×4 -6 +8 → 8-6=2; 2+8=10.

Option 5: 2 -4 +6×8 → (-2)+48=46.

Option 6: 2 -4×6 +8 → 2-24= -22; -22+8=-14.

Hmm, that's the same as before. So the maximum from these is 46, which is option F. But wait, looking at the options, E is 99, which is higher. So perhaps I missed some possibilities. Maybe I didn't consider all operator placements correctly.

Wait, no, because each operator is used exactly once. So I have to use each of +, ×, and - once in the three blanks. So I have to arrange them in some order. So perhaps I made a mistake in considering the permutations.

Wait, let me try a different approach. Maybe I can calculate the possible expressions in a different way. Let me list all possible operator orders again, but maybe I missed one.

Wait, the operators are +, ×, -, so the possible permutations are 6 in total. Let me make sure I considered all of them.

1. +, ×, - → 2+4×6-8=18

2. +, -, × → 2+4-6×8= (2+4)=6; 6-48=-42

3. ×, +, - → 2×4+6-8=8+6=14; 14-8=6

4. ×, -, + → 2×4-6+8=8-6=2; 2+8=10

5. -, +, × → 2-4+6×8= (-2)+48=46

6. -, ×, + → 2-4×6+8= 2-24= -22; -22+8=-14

Wait, that's all 6. So the maximum is 46. So the answer should be F:46.

But wait, let me check the problem again to make sure I didn't misread. Oh wait, the problem says that John must use each symbol exactly once. So that's correct, each of +, ×, and - once.

Wait, but in the options, E is 99. So perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe there's a way to arrange the operators that I didn't consider.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe I can have the multiplication in a different place. For example, maybe I can have 2 +4 × (6 -8). Wait, no, because he can't use parentheses. So operations are done from left to right, with multiplication taking precedence.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I can arrange the operations so that a larger number is multiplied. Let me think about 4 ×6 ×8, but wait, I can't do that because I have to use each operator exactly once.

Wait, but I'm allowed only one multiplication, one addition, and one subtraction. So perhaps I can arrange it so that a larger multiplication happens later.

Wait, let's think about this expression: 2 +4 ×6 -8. That's 2 +24 -8=18.

What if the multiplication is between 6 and 8, but then how? Let me see. For example, if the operators are arranged as -, ×, +, then the expression is 2 -4 ×6 +8. Oh, that's 2-24+8=-14. Not good.

Alternatively, the operators as ×, +, -: 2×4+6-8=8+6=14-8=6.

Hmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Wait, let me try another approach. Let's compute all possible operator permutations again, but perhaps I made a mistake in calculation.

1. +, ×, -: 2 + (4×6) -8 → 2+24=26-8=18.

2. +, -, ×: 2 +4 - (6×8) → 6 -48= -42.

Wait, no, 2+4 is 6, minus 48 is -42.

3. ×, +, -: (2×4)+6 -8 →8+6=14-8=6.

4. ×, -, +: 2×4 -6 +8 →8-6=2+8=10.

5. -, +, ×: 2 -4 + (6×8) →-2 +48=46.

6. -, ×, +: 2 - (4×6) +8 →2-24= -22 +8= -14.

Hmm. So the maximum is 46. So the answer is F:46.

But wait, the options given include C:100 and E:99, which are higher than 46. So perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe I can find a way to get a higher number.

Wait, maybe I'm allowed to use only two operators? No, the problem says each symbol exactly once, so +, ×, and -, each used once. So three operators in three blanks.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the expression is 2 op1 4 op2 6 op3 8, and the operations are in some order that allows for a larger number.

Wait, let me consider another approach. Let's list all possible operator permutations and calculate each result again, perhaps I made an error in one of them.

1. op1 = +, op2 = ×, op3 = -

Expression: 2+4×6-8.

Calculate: 4×6=24. Then 2+24=26. 26-8=18.

2. op1=+, op2=-, op3=×

Expression: 2+4-6×8.

Calculate: 6×8=48. Then 2+4=6. 6-48= -42.

3. op1=×, op2=+, op3=-

Expression: 2×4+6-8.

Calculate: 2×4=8. 8+6=14. 14-8=6.

4. op1=×, op2=-, op3=+

Expression: 2×4-6+8.

Compute 2×4=8. 8-6=2. 2+8=10.

5. op1=-, op2=+, op3=×

Expression: 2-4+6×8.

Compute 6×8=48. 2-4=-2. -2+48=46.

6. op1=-, op2=×, op3=+

Expression: 2-4×6+8.

Compute 4×6=24. 2-24=-22. -22+8=-14.

So the maximum is 46, which is option F. So unless I made a mistake, that's the highest possible. But wait, perhaps I missed a permutation where the multiplication is between 4 and 6, and then adding 2 and 8 in a way that gives a higher result.

Wait, let's think: if I have 2 +4 ×6 -8, that's 18.

Alternatively, 2 ×4 +6 -8 is 6.

Wait, but another possibility: what if the multiplication is between 6 and 8, but then what's the rest. For example, 2 -4 +6×8=46, which is what I have.

Alternatively, if I have 2 + (4 -6) ×8, but that would require parentheses, which John can't use.

So without parentheses, the operations are evaluated left to right, with multiplication done before addition and subtraction.

So perhaps I've considered all possibilities correctly.

Wait, but let me think again. Another possible permutation: op1=×, op2=-, op3=+.

That's 2×4-6+8=8-6=2+8=10.

No, that's lower.

Alternatively, op1=+, op2=×, op3=-: 2+4×6-8=18.

Wait, another thought: what if I have 2 +4 × (6 -8), but again, that's using parentheses, which isn't allowed.

So, in that case, I can't do that. So the expression is evaluated as 2 + (4×6) -8=18.

So, after going through all possibilities, the highest I can get is 46, which is option F.

Wait, but option E is 99. How could that happen? Let me see if I can find a way to get 99. Let me think differently.

Wait, perhaps I'm allowed to use the operators in a way that I haven't considered. For example, if I have 2 op1 4 op2 6 op3 8.

Wait, another thought: perhaps op1 is ×, op2 is ×, but no, because each symbol must be used exactly once.

Wait, no, because each of +, ×, and - must be used once. So I can't use × twice.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the order of operations. Let me double-check.

In the fifth permutation, the expression is 2 -4 +6×8.

So the multiplication is done first: 6×8=48.

Then the expression becomes 2 -4 +48.

But since addition and subtraction are left to right, it's (2 -4) +48= (-2)+48=46.

Yes, that's correct.

Wait, but what if the operators were arranged as op1=+, op2=-, op3=×, which would give 2+4-6×8=-42.

No, that's worse.

Alternatively, op1=×, op2=-, op3=+, which is 2×4-6+8=8-6+8=10.

Wait, no, that's 8-6=2, then 2+8=10.

Wait, perhaps I can find a way to have a larger multiplication. Let me think: if I have 4 ×6=24, then maybe adding that to 8 and 2.

Wait, but the operators are placed between the numbers, so the expression would be 2 +4 ×6 -8=18, as before.

Alternatively, 2 ×4=8, then 8+6=14, 14-8=6.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe the problem allows me to have a two-digit number? Like, 24 or 48 or something. Wait, but no, the numbers are fixed as 2,4,6,8, so I can't change that. So the only way is to apply the operations between them.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the order of operations can be changed by the way I place the operators, but with the constraints of left to right and multiplication first.

Wait, let me try op1=+, op2=×, op3=-.

Expression: 2+4×6-8.

Compute 4×6=24.

Then 2+24=26.

26-8=18.

Alternatively, if I could have 2+ (4× (6-8)), but that's parentheses, which isn't allowed.

Wait, perhaps I could have 2 +4 × (6-8), but again, that's parentheses. So no.

Hmm, I'm stuck. So according to all possible permutations, the highest is 46, which is option F. But the options include higher numbers. So perhaps I'm missing a permutation.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the possible operator orders.

Wait, there are 3! =6 permutations. Let me list them again:

1. +, ×, - → 2+4×6-8=18.

2. +, -, × → 2+4-6×8= -42.

3. ×, +, - → 2×4+6-8=6.

4. ×, -, + → 2×4-6+8=10.

5. -, +, × → 2-4+6×8=46.

6. -, ×, + → 2-4×6+8=-14.

So that's all of them. So the maximum is 46.

Wait, but perhaps I can find another way. Let me try to think if there's any way to get a higher number.

Wait, what if I have 2 - (4-6) ×8? But that would require parentheses, which isn't allowed.

Alternatively, 2 -4×6 +8=2-24+8=-14.

No, that's worse.

Wait, unless I can arrange the operators in a way that the subtraction comes after a larger multiplication. But I don't see how without parentheses.

Wait, perhaps I can have 2 +4 ×6 -8=18, but that's lower than 46.

Hmm, I think I've exhausted all possibilities. So the highest possible number is 46, which is option F.

Wait, but the options include C:100 and E:99. So perhaps I made a mistake in the problem statement. Wait, let me read the question again.

Wait, the question says that John must put the symbols +, ×, and - in the blanks, using each exactly once. The numbers are 2, 4, 6, 8.

So the expression is 2 _ 4 _ 6 _ 8.

Wait, perhaps I can find a way to have a higher number by placing the multiplication in a different position.

Wait, let's think about 2 +4 ×6 -8. We've done that. It's 18.

Wait,
