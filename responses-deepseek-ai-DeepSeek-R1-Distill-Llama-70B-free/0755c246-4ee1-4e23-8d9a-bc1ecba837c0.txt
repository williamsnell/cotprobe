Question:

A 27-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 3-year history of chronic diarrhea and intermittent, crampy, lower abdominal pain. The pain is usually relieved with defecation and does not occur at night or interfere with sleep. She says she is frustrated by her symptoms and has stopped traveling because of her frequent, urgent need to use the bathroom. She has no history of serious illness and takes no medications. Her temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 70/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg. The lower abdomen is mildly tender to palpation; there is no rebound tenderness or guarding. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. Results of laboratory studies are within the reference ranges. Test of the stool for occult blood is negative. Antigliadin antibodies are not present. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacotherapy?

Options:

A: Fluoxetine
B: Lorazepam
C: Nortriptyline
D: Paroxetine
E: Nefazodone
F: Venlafaxine
G: Zolpidem
H: Sertraline
I: Phenelzine
J: Trazodone

Okay, so I've got this question here about a 27-year-old woman with chronic diarrhea and abdominal pain. Let me try to break this down. She's had symptoms for three years, which are pretty persistent. The symptoms include chronic diarrhea and intermittent, crampy lower abdominal pain. The pain is usually relieved when she defecates, and it doesn't happen at night or interfere with her sleep. That's a bit specific.

She's frustrated and has stopped traveling because of the urgency to use the bathroom. She doesn't have a history of serious illnesses and isn't taking any medications. Her vital signs are all normal—temperature, pulse, respirations, and blood pressure are within normal ranges. On physical exam, her lower abdomen is mildly tender but no rebound tenderness or guarding, which makes me think it's not something acute like appendicitis or a perforation.

Lab studies are normal, stool occult blood is negative, and antigliadin antibodies are not present. Antigliadin antibodies are associated with celiac disease, so that's probably ruled out. So, the differential diagnosis here—since she has chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain that's relieved by defecation, and normal labs—I'm thinking maybe Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), specifically IBS-D (diarrhea-predominant).

Now, the question is about the most appropriate pharmacotherapy. The options are all antidepressants, which is interesting. I remember that some antidepressants are used off-label for treating IBS, especially when there are symptoms like pain or when the patient is experiencing a lot of stress or anxiety that might be exacerbating the condition.

Looking at the options:

A: Fluoxetine — an SSRI. SSRIs can sometimes be used for IBS, especially when there's a component of depression or anxiety. But I also recall that some SSRIs can have GI side effects. Wait, fluoxetine is actually known to sometimes cause diarrhea as a side effect because it can have a prokinetic effect. So maybe that's not the best choice here since the patient already has diarrhea.

B: Lorazepam — a benzodiazepine. These are anxiolytics. They might help with anxiety but don't directly address the IBS symptoms. Also, they can be habit-forming, so probably not a first-line treatment for IBS.

C: Nortriptyline — a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). TCAs are sometimes used for chronic pain and can help with the abdominal pain in IBS. They also have a constipating effect, which might be beneficial for someone with diarrhea-predominant IBS. So this could be a good option.

D: Paroxetine — another SSRI. Similar to fluoxetine, but I think paroxetine might actually be more likely to cause constipation, as it has more anticholinergic effects. Wait, but if the patient has diarrhea, using a medication that causes constipation might help. However, I'm not sure if that's the primary approach. Also, the patient doesn't have a diagnosed mood disorder, so using an SSRI might not be the first choice unless she's experiencing anxiety or depression alongside.

E: Nefazodone — an atypical antidepressant. Not sure about its GI effects. It's more commonly associated with liver issues, I think. Probably not the go-to here.

F: Venlafaxine — an SNRI (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor). These can sometimes be used for chronic pain but I'm not certain about their use in IBS specifically. They might help with both pain and mood, but again, not sure if it's the best fit here.

G: Zolpidem — a hypnotic used for insomnia. Doesn't seem relevant for IBS treatment.

H: Sertraline — another SSRI. Like fluoxetine, it can cause GI issues, maybe diarrhea. So similar to option A, maybe not the best choice.

I: Phenelzine — an MAOI (monoamine oxidase inhibitor). These are older antidepressants with a lot of side effects and dietary restrictions. Definitely not a first-line treatment for IBS.

J: Trazodone — another atypical antidepressant, often used for sleep. It has some serotonin activity. Not sure about its role in IBS, but again, doesn't seem like a primary treatment.

So, thinking back, the patient likely has IBS-D, given the chronic nature, relief with defecation, no nocturnal symptoms, normal labs, and no blood in stool. Antidepressants are sometimes used for IBS, especially for the pain component. TCAs like nortriptyline (option C) are often used off-label for IBS because they can help with pain and may have a constipating effect, which can be beneficial in diarrhea-predominant cases.

Wait, but another thought: sometimes SSRIs are used in IBS, especially if the patient has comorbid anxiety or depression. But in this case, the patient doesn't have a history of serious illness, and the question doesn't mention mood symptoms. So maybe the better option is a TCA because of the constipating effect.

Alternatively, if the patient's condition is more anxiety-related, an SSRI might be better. But her main issues are the physical symptoms of IBS. So perhaps nortriptyline is the way to go.

Looking at the options again, the other possible choice could be a different SSRI. For example, some studies suggest that SSRIs can be helpful in IBS, particularly when there's a component of diarrhea. Wait, am I mixing this up? I think that for IBS-D, TCAs are more likely to be used, especially for pain and to slow bowel movements. So nortriptyline (option C) would be the choice.

Another point: the patient's pain is crampy and relieved by defecation, which is classic for IBS. Since she's had this for three years and it's affecting her life, she needs an effective treatment. TCAs are often used in lower doses for IBS than for depression, focusing on their analgesic effects rather than mood elevation.

So the most appropriate pharmacotherapy would be nortriptyline, option C.

The patient is a 27-year-old woman with a 3-year history of chronic diarrhea and intermittent, crampy lower abdominal pain, which is relieved by defecation and does not occur at night. She has no history of serious illness, takes no medications, and her laboratory studies, including stool occult blood and antigliadin antibodies, are normal. These findings suggest a diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea predominance (IBS-D). The question asks for the most appropriate pharmacotherapy.

The options provided are primarily antidepressants, which are often used off-label for IBS, particularly for managing pain and bowel habits. Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) like nortriptyline are commonly used in IBS due to their analgesic properties and their ability to slow intestinal motility, which can be beneficial for diarrhea-predominant symptoms. While SSRIs like fluoxetine or paroxetine may also be considered, they can sometimes exacerbate diarrhea or have variable effects on bowel habits. Other options, such as benzodiazepines (e.g., lorazepam) or atypical antidepressants (e.g., trazodone), are less appropriate as first-line treatments for IBS-D.

Given the patient's symptoms and the need to address both pain and diarrhea, nortriptyline (option C) is the most appropriate choice due to its established use in IBS for pain relief and its constipating effect, which can help mitigate diarrhea.

Answer: C
