Question:

Connie Computer decided to purchase a $1,000 laptop computer to use during law school. When she went into Computer Retailer Inc., the salesperson also sold her a 5-year service agreement for $1,200 for a total price of $2,200. Nine months later, the laptop stopped working and Computer Retailer refused to perform on their service agreement. If Connie sues Computer Retailer, the trial court will likely find for

Options:

A: Computer Retailer, under the UCC unless the predominate reason for entering into the contract was for the service portion of the contract.
B: Connie, under the UCC unless the predominate purpose of the agreement was for the service agreement portion of the contract.
C: Connie, under the common law unless the predominate reason for entering into the contract was for the service portion of the contract.
D: Computer Retailer, only if the court determines that the predominate purpose of the contract was for the goods portion of the contract.
E: Connie, under the common law because the predominate purpose for which the parties contracted was the sale of goods.
F: Computer Retailer, if the court determines that the predominate purpose of the agreement is determined by intent and not the relative dollars assigned to the computer and the service agreement.
G: Connie, under the UCC only if the predominate reason for entering into the contract was for the goods portion of the contract.
H: Computer Retailer, under the common law if the court determines that the predominate purpose of the agreement was for the service agreement portion of the contract.
I: Connie, if the court determines that the predominate purpose of the agreement is determined by the relative dollars assigned to the computer and the service agreement.
J: Computer Retailer, if the court determines that the service agreement was not a significant part of the contract.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out this legal question about contracts and which law applies. Let me think through this step by step.

The question involves Connie buying a laptop and a service agreement. The total was $2,200, with the laptop being $1,000 and the service $1,200. Later, the laptop breaks, and the retailer refuses to honor the service agreement. She's suing, so we need to determine who the court will likely rule for.

I remember that contracts can be governed by either the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) or common law, depending on whether the contract is primarily for goods or services. The UCC applies to the sale of goods, while common law typically applies to services or if the predominant purpose isn't goods.

So, the key here is determining whether the contract is mainly for goods or services. The price might give a hint—$1,000 for goods and $1,200 for services. But I think the court looks at the predominant purpose, not just the price. 

In cases where it's a mixed contract (both goods and services), the court decides which part is predominant. If it's mainly for goods, UCC applies. If it's mainly for services, common law applies.

The UCC has specific rules about service contracts. Wait, no—wait, the UCC is for goods. So if the main purpose is goods, UCC applies. Otherwise, common law.

So, Connie bought a laptop (goods) and a service agreement (services). The question is, which is predominant? The laptop is $1k, service is $1.2k. So the service is more expensive. But I'm not sure if the price is the only factor. Sometimes, courts look at the primary intent of the parties. Why did she buy both? She bought the laptop to use it, and the service agreement is to cover repairs or replacements. The service is ancillary to the goods because she's using the laptop. So maybe the predominant purpose is the goods.

Wait, but the service agreement was sold as a separate contract. Or was it part of the same transaction? The question says she bought the laptop and a service agreement for a total of $2,200. So it's a single contract that includes both goods and services.

Under the UCC, if the predominant purpose is goods, the whole contract is governed by UCC. If it's services, then common law applies.

So, the court will look at whether the main reason she entered into the contract was for the laptop (goods) or the service. In this case, she's a law student buying a laptop to use, so the laptop is the main purpose. The service agreement is just an add-on, even though it's more expensive. Because the laptop is a necessity for her, whereas the service is just an extra to protect her investment.

Alternatively, some courts might look at which is more expensive, but I think the predominant purpose based on the nature of the items is more important. So the contract is primarily a goods contract, so UCC applies.

If the contract is under UCC, then the service agreement would fall under the UCC's rules. But wait, service agreements might be considered a service contract, but when sold with goods, the UCC could still apply if it's part of the same contract.

Wait, but the question is about whether the service agreement is part of the goods contract. If the service agreement is considered a service, then maybe the UCC doesn't cover it unless it's part of the goods sale.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. So, if the contract's predominant purpose is goods, the UCC applies to the entire contract, including the service part. If it's services, then common law applies.

In this case, the laptop is a good, but the service is a service. Since she's buying both, but the main reason is the laptop, the UCC applies. So the service agreement would be part of the UCC contract.

Wait, but the UCC mainly deals with goods. So maybe the service part is not covered by the UCC. Or perhaps when the service is part of the same contract, the UCC applies. I'm a bit fuzzy on that.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer depends on whether the court deems the contract as predominantly goods or services. Since the laptop is a good, and the service is related to it, the contract is for goods, so UCC applies.

So if the contract is under UCC, and the service agreement is part of the goods contract, then Connie can sue under the UCC. The retailer's refusal to perform the service agreement would be a breach of contract under the UCC.

Looking at the options, the UCC applies if the predominant purpose is goods. So the correct answer would be that Connie wins unless the predominant purpose was services.

Looking at the options:

Option B says Connie wins under UCC unless the predominant purpose was service.

Option G says Connie wins under UCC only if the predominant reason was goods.

Wait, no. Let me look again.

Option B: Connie, under the UCC unless the predominant purpose was service.

Option G: Connie under UCC only if predominant reason was goods.

Wait, but the UCC applies when the predominant purpose is goods. So if the court finds that the predominant purpose was goods, then UCC applies, and Connie can recover. If the predominant purpose was services, then common law applies.

But which of the options reflects this?

Option B says Connie wins under UCC unless predominant was service. So if the predominant was service, then maybe the contract is governed by common law. But I'm not sure if that affects the outcome.

Wait, but if the contract is governed by common law, then the service agreement would be a service contract. But in this case, the service agreement is part of the same contract as the goods.

Alternatively, perhaps the court would determine which law applies, and if it's UCC, the service part is covered.

But the question is, when Connie sues, the trial court will likely find for whom.

So, the UCC applies when the contract is predominantly for goods. If that's the case, then the service agreement would be part of the UCC contract, and the retailer's breach would be under UCC.

So the correct option would have Connie winning under UCC if the contract is predominantly goods.

Looking back, option B says Connie wins under UCC unless the predominant purpose was service. So that makes sense.

Alternatively, option G says Connie wins under UCC only if predominant reason was goods. So if the predominant is goods, then she wins under UCC. If not, then maybe she doesn't.

Wait, but the question is about whether the trial court would find for Connie or the retailer.

If the predominant purpose is goods, then the UCC applies, and the service agreement is part of the goods contract. So the retailer's refusal to perform the service agreement is a breach, so Connie would win.

So the question is, which option says that Connie wins under UCC unless the predominant purpose was service.

Looking at option B: Connie, under the UCC unless the predominant purpose was service.

Yes, that seems right. So if the contract is predominantly for goods (laptop), UCC applies, and she wins. If it's predominantly service, then perhaps common law applies, but then maybe the outcome is different.

Wait, but what if the contract is governed by common law? Then, the service agreement would be a service contract, and perhaps the retailer's obligations are different. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the answer is option B because it correctly states that under UCC, Connie wins unless the predominant purpose is service.

So the trial court would likely find for Connie unless the contract was mainly for services.

I think that's the correct approach.

The question revolves around whether the contract between Connie and Computer Retailer is governed by the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) or common law. The UCC applies to contracts where the predominant purpose is the sale of goods, while common law applies when the predominant purpose is services. In this case, Connie purchased a laptop (a good) for $1,000 and a 5-year service agreement for $1,200, totaling $2,200. Although the service agreement is more expensive, the court is likely to focus on the predominant purpose of the contract rather than the price.

The laptop is essential for Connie's use as a law student, suggesting that the primary intent of the contract was to acquire the laptop, with the service agreement being ancillary. Therefore, the contract is likely considered a goods contract under the UCC. Under the UCC, the service agreement would fall within the scope of the goods contract, and Computer Retailer's refusal to perform the service agreement would constitute a breach of contract. Consequently, the trial court would likely rule in favor of Connie under the UCC unless the predominant purpose of the contract was deemed to be the service agreement.

Among the options, **Option B** correctly states that Connie will prevail under the UCC unless the predominant purpose of the agreement was the service portion of the contract.
