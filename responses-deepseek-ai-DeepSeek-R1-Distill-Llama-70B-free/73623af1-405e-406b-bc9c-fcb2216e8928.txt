Okay, I have this problem about joint density functions and cumulative distribution functions. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let's try to think it through.

So the question says that the joint density function f(x, y, z) is equal to e^-(x+y+z) for x, y, z greater than 0. I need to find the cumulative distribution function F(x, y, z) for X, Y, and Z.

Wait, right, the cumulative distribution function (CDF) for multiple variables is the probability that all of them are less than or equal to their respective values. So F(x, y, z) = P(X ≤ x, Y ≤ y, Z ≤ z). To find this, I have to integrate the joint density function over the region where each variable is from 0 up to x, y, z respectively.

So the CDF would be the triple integral of f(u, v, w) du dv dw, with u from 0 to x, v from 0 to y, and w from 0 to z.

Let me set that up. The integral becomes ∫ from 0 to x ∫ from 0 to y ∫ from 0 to z e^-(u+v+w) dw dv du.

Hmm, wait, the order of integration doesn't matter because the integrand is separable. So maybe I can compute each integral one by one.

Let me first compute the innermost integral with respect to w. So ∫ from 0 to z e^-(u+v+w) dw. Let me treat u and v as constants here. So this becomes e^-(u+v) * ∫ from 0 to z e^-w dw.

The integral of e^-w dw is -e^-w, evaluated from 0 to z. So that's (-e^-z) - (-e^0) = 1 - e^-z. So the inner integral is e^-(u+v) (1 - e^-z).

Now, the middle integral is with respect to v. So ∫ from 0 to y e^-(u+v) (1 - e^-z) dv. Wait, (1 - e^-z) is a constant with respect to v, so I can factor that out.

So it's (1 - e^-z) * e^-u ∫ from 0 to y e^-v dv. The integral of e^-v is again -e^-v, from 0 to y. So that's (1 - e^-y).

Putting it all together, after the middle integral, we have (1 - e^-z)(1 - e^-y) e^-u. Now, the outermost integral is with respect to u from 0 to x.

So ∫ from 0 to x e^-u (1 - e^-y)(1 - e^-z) du. Again, (1 - e^-y)(1 - e^-z) are constants, so factor them out. The integral becomes (1 - e^-y)(1 - e^-z) ∫ from 0 to x e^-u du.

The integral of e^-u is -e^-u, evaluated from 0 to x. So that's (1 - e^-x). Multiply all the terms together.

So the CDF F(x, y, z) is (1 - e^-x)(1 - e^-y)(1 - e^-z). Let me check the options. Option F is exactly that: (1 - e^-x)(1 - e^-y)(1 - e^-z) for x, y, z > 0. So that should be the correct answer.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. The joint PDF is e^-(x+y+z) without any coefficients, which suggests that the variables are independent. Because the joint PDF factors into the product of functions each depending on a single variable. So if X, Y, Z are independent, their CDFs would multiply. So each marginal CDF would be 1 - e^-t for t >0, and since they're independent, the joint CDF is the product. So yes, that makes sense.

Looking back at the options: Option F is exactly the product of (1 - e^-x)(1 - e^-y)(1 - e^-z). So that's the right choice.

To find the cumulative distribution function \( F(x, y, z) \) of the random variables \( X, Y, Z \), we start with the given joint density function:

\[
f(x, y, z) = e^{-(x+y+z)} \quad \text{for } x, y, z > 0.
\]

The cumulative distribution function (CDF) is defined as:

\[
F(x, y, z) = P(X \leq x, Y \leq y, Z \leq z).
\]

To compute this, we integrate the joint density function over the region where \( 0 \leq u \leq x \), \( 0 \leq v \leq y \), and \( 0 \leq w \leq z \):

\[
F(x, y, z) = \int_0^x \int_0^y \int_0^z e^{-(u+v+w)} \, dw \, dv \, du.
\]

### Step 1: Integrate with respect to \( w \)
The innermost integral is:

\[
\int_0^z e^{-(u+v+w)} \, dw = e^{-(u+v)} \int_0^z e^{-w} \, dw.
\]

The integral of \( e^{-w} \) is \( -e^{-w} \), so:

\[
\int_0^z e^{-w} \, dw = 1 - e^{-z}.
\]

Thus, the result of the first integral is:

\[
e^{-(u+v)} (1 - e^{-z}).
\]

### Step 2: Integrate with respect to \( v \)
The middle integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^y e^{-(u+v)} (1 - e^{-z}) \, dv = (1 - e^{-z}) e^{-u} \int_0^y e^{-v} \, dv.
\]

Again, the integral of \( e^{-v} \) is \( -e^{-v} \), so:

\[
\int_0^y e^{-v} \, dv = 1 - e^{-y}.
\]

Thus, the result of the second integral is:

\[
(1 - e^{-z})(1 - e^{-y}) e^{-u}.
\]

### Step 3: Integrate with respect to \( u \)
The outermost integral becomes:

\[
\int_0^x (1 - e^{-z})(1 - e^{-y}) e^{-u} \, du = (1 - e^{-z})(1 - e^{-y}) \int_0^x e^{-u} \, du.
\]

The integral of \( e^{-u} \) is \( -e^{-u} \), so:

\[
\int_0^x e^{-u} \, du = 1 - e^{-x}.
\]

Thus, the final result for the CDF is:

\[
F(x, y, z) = (1 - e^{-x})(1 - e^{-y})(1 - e^{-z}).
\]

### Correct Option
From the given options, the correct choice is:

**F: \( (1 - e^{-x})(1 - e^{-y})(1 - e^{-z}) \) for \( x, y, z > 0 \).**
