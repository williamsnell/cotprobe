Okay, so I've got this physics problem about mirrors, and I'm a bit rusty on the concepts, but I'll try to think it through. Let me read the question again.

An object is placed 10 cm in front of a diverging mirror. The image appears 2 cm behind the mirror. I need to find the focal length of the mirror. The options are various fractions and negative numbers, so I know sign conventions are going to matter here.

Hmm, I remember that mirrors have something to do with the focal point. Oh right, diverging mirrors have a virtual focal point behind the mirror. So the focal length should be negative, I think. Wait, sign conventions in optics can be a bit confusing. Let me get this straight.

The mirror equation is 1/f = 1/do + 1/di, where do is the object distance, di is the image distance, and f is the focal length. I think for mirrors, the object distance is positive when it's in front of the mirror. So here, the object is placed 10 cm in front, so do = +10 cm.

The image is 2 cm behind the mirror, which I believe is considered a negative image distance because it's on the same side as the object (for diverging mirrors, images are virtual and located behind the mirror). Wait, no, wait. Wait, conventions might vary. Let me think: in the standard convention, for mirrors, the object distance is positive if it's in front (real object). The image distance is positive if it's in front (real image) and negative if behind (virtual image). So for a diverging mirror, which always produces virtual images, the image distance is negative. So in this case, di is -2 cm.

Wait, no, wait. No, because the image is behind the mirror, so di would be negative. Because the real images are in front, virtual behind. So yes, di = -2 cm.

So plugging into the mirror equation:

1/f = 1/do + 1/di
1/f = 1/10 + 1/(-2)
Wait, 1/10 is 0.1, 1/(-2) is -0.5. So 0.1 - 0.5 = -0.4.

So 1/f = -0.4, which is -2/5. Therefore, f = 1 / (-0.4) = -2.5 cm, which is the same as -5/2 cm.

Wait, but looking at the options, option D is -5/2 cm. So yeah, that's the answer.

Wait, but I should double-check. Maybe I got the signs wrong. Let me think again.

The formula is 1/f = 1/do + 1/di.

do is positive because the object is real and in front. di is negative because image is virtual and behind.

So do = +10 cm, di = -2 cm.

Compute 1/10 + (1/-2) = 0.1 - 0.5 = -0.4.

So 1/f = -0.4 â†’ f = -1/(0.4) = -2.5 cm. Which is -5/2 cm. So yes, option D.

Wait, but another thought: wait, for diverging mirrors, the focal length is considered negative in the standard convention. So yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, some sources might use different conventions. Oh wait, wait! No, wait another thing. Wait, for diverging mirrors, the focal point is behind the mirror, so f is negative. So in our calculation, f is negative, which matches the options.

So yeah, I'm confident it's option D.

To solve the problem, we use the mirror equation:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{d_o} + \frac{1}{d_i}
\]

Here:
- \( d_o = +10 \, \text{cm} \) (object distance is positive because the object is in front of the mirror),
- \( d_i = -2 \, \text{cm} \) (image distance is negative because the image is virtual and behind the mirror),
- \( f \) is the focal length of the mirror.

Substituting the values into the equation:

\[
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{10} + \frac{1}{-2}
\]

\[
\frac{1}{f} = 0.1 - 0.5 = -0.4
\]

\[
f = \frac{1}{-0.4} = -2.5 \, \text{cm}
\]

Thus, the focal length of the mirror is \(-2.5 \, \text{cm}\), which is equivalent to \(-\frac{5}{2} \, \text{cm}\). Comparing this result with the options provided, the correct answer is:

**D: \(-\frac{5}{2} \, \text{cm}\)**.

The negative sign indicates that the mirror is diverging, as expected.
