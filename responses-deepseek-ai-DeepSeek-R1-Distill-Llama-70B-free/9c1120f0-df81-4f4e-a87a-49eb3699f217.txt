Okay, so I've got this economics problem here, and I'm trying to wrap my head around it. Let me read it again carefully.

The question says that a firm hires labor for $15 each and sells its products for $3 each. The marginal product (MP) of the 3rd worker is 10. I need to figure out which statement is the most true from the options provided.

Hmm, I remember that in economics, firms make decisions based on marginal analysis, specifically comparing marginal revenue product (MRP) with marginal cost (MC). The goal is to maximize profits.

So, the MRP is the additional revenue a firm earns from hiring an additional worker. It's calculated as MP multiplied by the price of the product. On the other hand, the marginal cost (MC) is the additional cost of hiring that worker, which in this case is $15.

Wait, let's break it down. The firm's selling price is $3 per unit. The MP of the 3rd worker is 10 units. So, MRP for the 3rd worker would be MP * Price = 10 * 3 = $30. The MC is $15. Comparing the two, MRP is $30, which is greater than MC of $15. So, the firm should hire this worker because they're adding more to revenue than the cost.

But wait, the question is about what the firm should do next. So, when a firm is producing where MRP equals MC, it's maximizing profit. If the current MRP is higher than MC, the firm should keep hiring more workers until MRP equals MC.

Wait, in this case, the MRP is $30, and the MC is $15. So the firm is getting more revenue from the 3rd worker than the cost. Therefore, the firm should hire more workers beyond the 3rd because each additional worker is adding more profit.

Wait, but let me think again. The MP of the 3rd worker is 10. So, if the firm is currently at 3 workers, and the 3rd worker's MRP is higher than MC, then the firm isn't yet at the optimal point. The optimal point is where MRP equals MC. So, the firm should hire more workers until the MRP of the next worker equals $15.

Wait, but if the MRP of the 3rd worker is $30, which is higher than $15, then adding a 4th worker would bring in more profit as long as their MRP is above $15. So, the firm would continue hiring until the MRP drops to $15.

But the question is, given that the 3rd worker's MP is 10, what should the firm do? The MRP is $30, which is higher than the wage ($15), so the firm is better off hiring more workers. Because each additional worker (up to the point where MRP=MC) adds to profit.

Looking at the options, I need to find which one suggests hiring more labor because the MRP is higher than MC.

Wait, the options are about MRPL. Oh, wait, maybe I misread that. Wait, the options mention MRPL. Hmm, MRPL isn't a standard term I remember. Wait, perhaps it's a typo and should be MRP? Or maybe it's MPL, which is marginal product of labor. Or perhaps it's MRPL meaning marginal revenue product of labor? Because MRP is the same as MRPL.

Wait, the question says "which of the following statements would be the most true?" The options talk about MRPL. So I should think in terms of MRPL. So, MRPL is MRP, which is MP times price.

So, for the 3rd worker, MRPL is 10 * 3 = 30, as I calculated earlier. The firm's wage rate is $15, which is the MC of labor.

In profit maximization, the firm hires until MRPL equals the wage rate. So, when MRPL > wage, the firm should hire more. When MRPL < wage, it should hire less.

In this case, MRPL is 30, which is greater than 15, so the firm should hire more workers. By hiring more, the MP of the next workers might decrease due to diminishing returns. So, each additional worker beyond 3 would have lower MP, thus lower MRPL, until MRPL reaches 15.

So, what happens when the firm hires more workers? The MRPL of those additional workers will decrease because of diminishing marginal returns, bringing MRPL down until it equals MC.

Which option suggests that the firm should hire more labor so that MRPL decreases? Let's check the options.

Option B says: The firm should hire more labor so that the MRPL will decrease.

Option H says: The firm should hire more labor so that the MRPL will increase.

Wait, no, if the firm hires more labor, the next worker's MP would be lower, leading to lower MRPL. So, option B is correct: hiring more leads to MRPL decreasing.

Wait, but let me make sure. Because each additional worker beyond 3 would have a lower MP, thus lower MRPL. So, by hiring more, the MRPL of the marginal worker decreases. So, the firm should hire more labor, causing MRPL to decrease until it equals the wage rate.

So, the correct action is to hire more labor because the current MRPL is higher than the wage. So, the correct statement is option B.

Wait, let me look at the options again.

Option A: Maintain current labor, MRPL remains constant. Not correct, because if you don't change labor, MRPL doesn't change, but you're not maximizing profit.

Option B: Hire more, MRPL decreases. Correct.

Option C: Hire less, MRPL increases. That's the opposite of what's needed.

Option D: Increase price so MRPL decreases. Changing price might affect, but the question is about labor hiring.

Option E: Increase price so MRPL increases. Hmm, if price increases, MRPL would increase for all workers, which would lead to hiring even more. But the question doesn't suggest changing prices; it's about labor.

Option F: Hire less so MRPL decreases. No, hiring less would cause MRPL to increase because you're moving to the left on the production function, so MP might increase.

Wait, the MP is the slope of the production function. If you have more workers, MP initially increases, reaches a maximum, then decreases (diminishing returns). Wait, no, MP typically increases up to a point and then decreases as more workers are added. So, if you have 3 workers, and MP is 10, adding more would cause MP to decrease, so MRPL would decrease.

So, if you hire more, MRPL goes down. So, option B is correct.

The firm hires labor for $15 each and sells its product for $3 each. The marginal product (MP) of the 3rd worker is 10 units. To determine the optimal course of action, we calculate the marginal revenue product of labor (MRPL) for the 3rd worker, which is:

\[
\text{MRPL} = \text{MP} \times \text{Price} = 10 \times 3 = \$30
\]

The marginal cost (MC) of hiring labor is $15. Since MRPL (\$30) is greater than MC (\$15), the firm is not yet at the profit-maximizing level of labor. To maximize profits, the firm should continue hiring additional workers until MRPL equals MC. As more workers are hired, the law of diminishing marginal returns will cause MP to decrease, and consequently, MRPL will also decrease.

Among the options provided, the correct statement is that the firm should hire more labor so that the MRPL will decrease. This aligns with the principle of profit maximization, where the firm hires labor until MRPL equals MC.
