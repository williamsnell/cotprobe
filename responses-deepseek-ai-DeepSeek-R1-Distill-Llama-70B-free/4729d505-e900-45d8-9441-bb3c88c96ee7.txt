Okay, so I have this question where Mr. Smith wants to find out how much interest he'll get from $300 at a 3% annual compound rate over three years. Hmm, I remember that compound interest is when you earn interest on both the initial principal and the accumulated interest from previous periods. So the formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt), where A is the amount after time t, P is principal, r is rate, n is the number of times interest is compounded per year, and t is time in years.

In this case, the problem says it's compounded annually, so n should be 1. Let me plug in the numbers. P is $300, r is 3% which is 0.03, t is 3 years. So the formula becomes A = 300(1 + 0.03/1)^(1*3). 

Calculating the inside first: 0.03 divided by 1 is 0.03. Adding 1 gives 1.03. Now, raising that to the power of 3. Hmm, I should compute 1.03^3. I think 1.03 times 1.03 is 1.0609, and then multiplying that by another 1.03. Let's do that step by step. So 1.0609 * 1.03. 

Wait, maybe I should calculate it more accurately. Let me compute 1.03^3. 

First, 1.03 * 1.03 is 1.0609. Then, 1.0609 * 1.03. Let me do that multiplication. 

1.0609 * 1.03: 
- 1.0609 * 1 = 1.0609
- 1.0609 * 0.03 = 0.031827
Adding those together: 1.0609 + 0.031827 = 1.092727. So 1.03^3 is approximately 1.092727.

Now, multiply that by the principal, 300. So 300 * 1.092727. Let's compute that. 

300 * 1.092727 equals... 300 times 1 is 300, 300 times 0.092727 is 27.8181. So adding them together, 300 + 27.8181 = 327.8181. 

So the total amount after three years is approximately $327.82. Wait, but the question is asking for the interest received, not the total amount. So the interest is the amount minus the principal. That would be 327.82 - 300 = $27.82. 

Looking at the options, option C is $27.82. So the correct answer should be C. 

Wait a second, let me double-check my calculation. Did I compute 1.03^3 correctly? Let me recalculate that. 

1.03 * 1.03 is 1.0609. Then 1.0609 * 1.03. Let's compute it as (1.0609 * 1) + (1.0609 * 0.03). 

1.0609 * 0.03 is 0.031827. So 1.0609 + 0.031827 equals 1.092727. Yep, that's correct. 

Then 300 * 1.092727. Let me compute that again. 300 * 1 is 300. 300 * 0.092727 is 27.8181. So total is 327.8181, so the interest is 27.8181, which rounds to $27.82. So yes, option C.

To calculate the interest Mr. Smith will receive on $300 at an annual compound rate of 3% over three years, we use the compound interest formula:

\[
A = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}
\]

Where:
- \( P = 300 \) (principal),
- \( r = 0.03 \) (annual interest rate),
- \( n = 1 \) (compounded annually),
- \( t = 3 \) (time in years).

Substituting the values:

\[
A = 300 \left(1 + \frac{0.03}{1}\right)^{1 \cdot 3} = 300 \left(1.03\right)^3
\]

First, calculate \( 1.03^3 \):
\[
1.03 \times 1.03 = 1.0609, \quad 1.0609 \times 1.03 = 1.092727
\]

Now, calculate the total amount \( A \):
\[
A = 300 \times 1.092727 = 327.8181
\]

The total interest received is:
\[
\text{Interest} = A - P = 327.8181 - 300 = 27.8181 \approx 27.82
\]

Thus, the interest Mr. Smith will receive is approximately **$27.82**, which corresponds to option **C**.
