Okay, so I have this problem about property taxes in Centerville, and I need to find the market value of a property. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step. 

First, the information given: the tax rate is 11 and a half percent. Wait, 11 and a half percent is the same as 11.5%, right? So that's the tax rate. Then, a tax of $1,794 was paid. Oh, and the assessment rate is 30%. I need to find the market value.

Wait, I remember that property taxes are usually calculated based on the assessed value, and the assessed value is a percentage of the market value. So the formula I think is: Tax = (Tax Rate) * (Assessed Value). And Assessed Value is (Assessment Rate) * (Market Value). So putting it together, Tax = Tax Rate * (Assessment Rate * Market Value).

So, the given tax is $1,794. The tax rate is 11.5%, which is 0.115 in decimal. The assessment rate is 30%, so 0.3. 

Let me write the formula again: Tax = (Tax Rate) * (Assessment Rate * Market Value). So rearranging this to find Market Value, it would be Market Value = Tax / (Tax Rate * Assessment Rate).

Plugging in the numbers: Market Value = 1794 / (0.115 * 0.3). Let me calculate the denominator first. 0.115 multiplied by 0.3. Hmm, 0.115 * 0.3 is 0.0345. So the denominator is 0.0345.

So Market Value = 1794 / 0.0345. Let me do this division. 1794 divided by 0.0345. Hmm, maybe I can make this easier by converting 0.0345 into a fraction or something. Alternatively, I can multiply numerator and denominator by 10000 to get rid of the decimals, but maybe that's too complicated.

Alternatively, let me think about it numerically. Let's see, 0.0345 is the same as 3.45% or 3.45 per 100. So 1794 divided by 0.0345. Let me use a calculator approach.

Wait, 1794 divided by 0.0345. Let's see: 0.0345 times 50,000 is 1725. Because 0.0345 * 10000 is 345, so times 50 is 17,250. Wait, wait, no, 0.0345 * 50,000 = (0.0345 * 10000) *5 = 345 *5=1725. Oh wait, but 1725 is less than 1794. So 50,000 would give 1725, which is 69 less than 1794. So how much more? 69 divided by 0.0345. Let's see, 69 / 0.0345. Hmm, 0.0345 * 2000 is 69. So 50,000 +2000=52,000. So 52,000 would give 0.0345 *52,000=1794. So the market value is $52,000.

Wait, but let me make sure. So tax is 11.5% of assessed value. Assessed value is 30% of market. So tax is 11.5% *30% of market. So 0.115 *0.3 is 0.0345, as before. So yes, tax is 3.45% of market value. So 1794 is 3.45% of market value, so market value is 1794 /0.0345=52,000.

Looking at the options, option I is $52,000. So the answer should be I.

To determine the market value of the property, we start by understanding the relationship between tax, tax rate, assessment rate, and market value. The formula is:

\[
\text{Tax} = \text{Tax Rate} \times (\text{Assessment Rate} \times \text{Market Value})
\]

Rearranging to solve for Market Value:

\[
\text{Market Value} = \frac{\text{Tax}}{\text{Tax Rate} \times \text{Assessment Rate}}
\]

Given:
- Tax = $1,794
- Tax Rate = 11.5% = 0.115
- Assessment Rate = 30% = 0.3

Substitute the values into the formula:

\[
\text{Market Value} = \frac{1,794}{0.115 \times 0.3}
\]

First, calculate the denominator:

\[
0.115 \times 0.3 = 0.0345
\]

Now divide:

\[
\text{Market Value} = \frac{1,794}{0.0345} = 52,000
\]

Thus, the market value of the property is **$52,000**, which corresponds to option I.
