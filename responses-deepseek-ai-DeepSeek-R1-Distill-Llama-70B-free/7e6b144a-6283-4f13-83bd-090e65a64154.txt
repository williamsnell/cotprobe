Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about court cases where one private party is suing another. I'm a bit rusty on my legal system, but let's try to work through this.

The question is asking which statement is true about such cases. The options are A through J. Let me go through each option one by one.

First, let me understand what kind of cases we're talking about. When a private party sues another, that's usually a civil case, right? Like, if someone sues for breach of contract or personal injury, that's a civil matter. So it's not a criminal case because criminal cases are usually the state or government prosecuting someone.

Now, looking at the options:

Option A: They are always resolved through arbitration, not court trials. Hmm, I don't think that's true. While arbitration is an option, especially if there's a contract clause about it, not all private disputes go through arbitration. Many still go to court if the parties can't agree or prefer litigation.

Option B: They are always tried in the Supreme Court. No, that doesn't make sense. The Supreme Court is the highest court and usually hears appeals on constitutional issues or federal laws. Most private cases start in lower courts, like state or federal district courts, not the Supreme Court.

Option C: They are tried in juvenile court. Juvenile court deals with cases involving minors, like delinquency or child welfare. So if it's a private party suing another, unless it's a family law issue involving minors, it's not juvenile court. So probably not C.

Option D: They are tried in international court. International courts handle cases between countries or international disputes. Unless the private parties are from different countries and the case has international implications, they wouldn't go to international court. So D seems unlikely.

Option E: The federal court system has exclusive jurisdiction over them. I don't think so. Federal courts handle cases involving federal laws or diversity jurisdiction (where parties are from different states and the amount in controversy is high). But many private cases are state matters, like contract disputes under state law, so state courts handle those. So E isn't correct.

Option F: The state court system has exclusive jurisdiction over them. Wait, no. Because some cases can go to federal court if they involve federal issues. So state courts don't have exclusive jurisdiction; it's shared in some areas. So F isn't right either.

Option G: They are exclusively tried in appellate court. No, appellate courts hear appeals from lower courts. The initial trial is in a trial court, not appellate. So G is incorrect.

Option H: The military court system has exclusive jurisdiction over them. Military courts handle cases involving military personnel. Unless the private parties are in the military, this wouldn't apply. So H is probably wrong.

Option I: They are tried in civil court. Yes, civil court is where private parties sue each other for things like contracts, torts, etc. So I looks correct.

Option J: They are tried in criminal court. No, criminal court is for crimes against the state, not private disputes. So J is wrong.

Wait, but let me double-check. So the question is about cases where private parties sue each other. So civil court is definitely where those cases go. So the correct answer should be I.

Let me make sure I'm not mixing anything up. Civil courts handle disputes between individuals or organizations, seeking remedies like damages or injunctions. Criminal courts deal with prosecution by the state. So yes, I is correct.

The correct answer is:

I: They are tried in civil court.

This is because cases where one private party sues another typically fall under civil law, dealing with disputes such as contracts, torts, and property issues. Civil courts are the appropriate venue for such matters, as opposed to criminal, juvenile, or other specialized courts.

Answer: I
