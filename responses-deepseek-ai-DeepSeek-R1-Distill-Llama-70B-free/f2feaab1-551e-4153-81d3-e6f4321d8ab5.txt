Okay, so I've got this physics problem here about the refracting power of a concave mirror when it's in contact with different mediums. Hmm, I remember that refracting power is related to the focal length, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me think.

Wait, refracting power, or diopters, is the reciprocal of the focal length in meters. Right, so the formula is D = 1/f, where f is in meters. But wait, that's for lenses, right? Or is it the same for mirrors? Oh wait, mirrors have a different approach. Oh right, for mirrors, the focal length is related to the radius of curvature. The focal length f is R/2, where R is the radius. So for a concave mirror, which is converging, the focal length is positive.

So if the radius here is 20 cm, that's 0.2 meters. So f = 0.2 / 2 = 0.1 meters. So in air, the refracting power would be 1/0.1 = 10 diopters. Oh wait, but wait a second. Is that right when the mirror is in different mediums? Because mirrors work by reflection, right? So does the refractive index of the surrounding medium affect the mirror's focal length?

Wait, no, because mirrors reflect based on the law of reflection. The change in medium affects refraction, but mirrors are about reflection. Oh wait, but wait again. The problem says "refracting power of a concave mirror". Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused between mirrors and lenses. Because for a lens, the diopter depends on the refractive index and the shape. But a mirror's focal length is independent of the surrounding medium, right? Because reflection doesn't depend on it. So the focal length should remain the same whether it's in air or water.

Wait, but the question is about refracting power. Oh, wait no, wait. Wait, a mirror doesn't have a refracting power in the same way a lens does. Because mirrors work through reflection, not refraction. So maybe the question is actually about a lens, but it says mirror. Hmm, that's confusing. Or maybe the term is being used differently.

Wait, perhaps the question is using "refracting power" as the power of the mirror. But in optics, mirrors have a reflective power, and the power is defined as 1/f, similar to lenses. So for a mirror, regardless of the medium, the focal length is R/2, so the power is 2/R. But wait, let me check the units.

The radius R is 20 cm, which is 0.2 meters. So f = 0.2 / 2 = 0.1 m. So the power D is 1/0.1 = 10 diopters in air. But then in water, does that change? Wait, no, because the mirror's focal length depends on the reflection, which doesn't involve the medium's refractive index. So the focal length remains the same, so the power remains the same.

Wait, but none of the options have the same value in both (a) and (b). So I must have made a mistake here. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the question. Perhaps it's not a mirror but a lens. Because for a lens made of a certain material, the refractive index affects its focal length. So, let me think again. If it's a concave lens, but that's diverging. Wait, the question says concave mirror, so I'm back to square one.

Wait, another angle. Maybe the problem is about a spherical interface, but that's more about refraction. Alternatively, perhaps the mirror is acting as part of a lens setup. No, the question is about the mirror itself.

Wait, another thought: refractive power could be in terms of the mirror's ability to reflect, but I don't think that's standard terminology. Alternatively, perhaps the mirror is being considered as an element in a medium, and the power is calculated based on the medium's refractive index. But mirrors don't have a refractive power in that way.

Wait, perhaps the question is incorrect, and it's actually about a lens. Let me think about that. If it's a concave lens, made of a material with refractive index n, then the lensmaker's formula applies. But the question is about a mirror, so I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps the mirror is submerged in a medium, and the question is about how that affects its focal length. But how? Because for a mirror, the reflection depends on the interface between two media. So wait, if the mirror is in a medium, like water, then part of the reflection occurs at the interface between the mirror's material and water. Wait, but typically, mirrors are made with a reflective coating on the back, so the reflection is from the coating, and the medium in front shouldn't affect the focal length. So the focal length remains R/2 regardless of the medium.

But according to that, the power D would be the same in both cases, which is 10 diopters. Looking at the options, option H is 10 diopters in air, 13.33 in water. But that suggests it's higher in water, which contradicts my conclusion. So perhaps my assumption is wrong.

Wait, maybe the mirror is acting as a lens in some way. Alternatively, perhaps the question is a trick, because the mirror's focal length doesn't change, so the power remains the same. But none of the options have the same value for both (a) and (b), except none of the options seem to do that. So perhaps I've made a mistake in my earlier reasoning.

Wait, another approach. Maybe the mirror is part of an optical system where the medium affects the overall power. For example, if the mirror is in a medium, perhaps the calculation uses the medium's refractive index. But how?

The formula for the power of a mirror is D = 2/R, where R is the radius in meters, but wait, no. Wait, the focal length is R/2, so D = 1/(R/(2)) ) = 2/(R in meters). So for R=0.2 m, D = 2/(0.2) =10 diopters.

But wait, maybe when the mirror is in a medium, the radius of curvature is effectively changed by the medium's refractive index. No, the radius is a physical property. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is treating the mirror as a lens with a certain refractive index. But that doesn't make sense, because mirrors are metallic and don't have a refractive index in the same way.

Wait, I'm getting stuck. Let me think again. For a mirror, the focal length is R/2, regardless of the medium. So the power should be the same in air and water. So the answer would be 10 diopters in both cases. But looking at the options, the closest is option H, which is 10 in air and 13.33 in water. So that's not the same.

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the mirror's power with a lens. Let me think about a lens. For a lens, the power depends on the refractive index of the material and the surrounding medium. The lensmaker's formula is 1/f = (n_lens - n_medium)(1/R1 - 1/R2), where R1 and R2 are the radii of curvature.

But the question is about a concave mirror, so perhaps the mirror is treated as a lens with a certain configuration. So if the mirror is considered as a spherical surface, perhaps the calculation is similar to a plano-concave lens.

Wait, if the mirror is in a medium, acting as a plano-concave lens, then perhaps the focal length is affected.

Wait, let's model the mirror as a plano-concave lens. For a plano-concave lens, one side is flat (R2 = infinity), and the other has radius R. So the lensmaker's equation becomes 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1), because 1/R2 is zero. But wait, R is negative for a plano-concave lens (since it's concave on the first surface and flat on the second). So R1 would be negative. Let me get the signs right.

Wait, in the lensmaker's formula, the signs of the radii depend on the direction. For a plano-concave lens, the radius R1 (the first surface) is negative because it's concave when looking from the incoming medium. Alternatively, I might have that backwards.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to think that for a plano-concave lens, the first radius R1 is negative, and the second radius R2 is positive infinity. So 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2). So 1/R2 is zero, so 1/f = (n-1)(1/R1). But R1 is negative because it's concave. So 1/f = (n-1)(1/(-R)) = -(n-1)/R.

Wait, but focal length for a lens is positive for converging. A plano-concave lens made of a material with higher index than the surrounding medium is diverging, so its focal length is negative. Hmm.

Wait, but in this case, the mirror is concave, but perhaps the setup treats the mirror as a lens. So in this case, when the mirror is in a medium, the effective focal length changes based on the surrounding medium.

Wait, perhaps the question is not about a mirror but about a lens. Because I'm getting confused. Let me try to proceed under the assumption that the question is actually about a concave lens, perhaps mistakenly called a mirror.

So assuming it's a concave lens with radius R = 20 cm (so 0.2 m). The question is, what is the power in air (n=1) and in water (n=1.33). Wait, no, the surrounding medium is water, and the lens material has a certain refractive index. But the problem doesn't state the lens material's index. Hmm, that complicates things.

Wait, perhaps the lens is made of the surrounding medium, which doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, maybe the lens has a refractive index higher than the surrounding medium. But the problem states n=1 and n=1.33 for the two cases, but I'm not sure which is the lens and which is the medium.

Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the mirror's reflecting surface as an interface between two media. So when the mirror is in air, the reflection is from the interface between glass (or metal) and air. When it's in water, it's between the mirror material and water.

But how does that affect the focal length? Well, the focal length of a mirror is determined by its radius, which is a physical property. So regardless of the medium in front of it, the radius remains the same, so the focal length remains R/2, and thus the power remains the same, 10 diopters.

But again, the options don't have the same value for both (a) and (b). So perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, perhaps the question is about the mirror's reflecting power in terms of its ability to reflect, but that doesn't relate to diopters. Diopters are a measure of refractive power, not reflective.

Alternatively, maybe the question intended to ask about a lens, and I'm overcomplicating it. Let me consider that possibility.

If it's a lens, then the lensmaker's formula applies. Let's say the lens is made of a material with refractive index n, and it's placed in a medium with refractive index n_medium.

Wait, no, the standard lensmaker's formula uses the lens material's refractive index relative to the surrounding medium. So when the lens is in a medium other than air, the effective (n_lens - n_medium) changes.

Wait, but the problem states n=1 for air and n=1.33 for water. Maybe it's the surrounding medium, and the lens is made of a material with a higher refractive index.

Wait, the problem says "the reflecting surface is in contact with" the medium. Hmm, perhaps it's not a lens but a spherical mirror whose back is filled with a medium. No, that wouldn't make sense because mirrors don't have a back in that way. They have a reflective coating on the back surface.

Alternatively, perhaps the mirror is acting as a lens in some way, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the question is about a plano-concave lens where the radius is 20 cm. So let's try that approach.

Assuming it's a plano-concave lens, then the lensmaker's equation in a medium would be:

1/f = (n_lens/n_medium - 1) * (1/R1)

Because for a plano-concave lens, R2 is infinity, so 1/R2 is 0. And R1 is negative because the lens is concave on the first surface.

Wait, but the sign conventions can be tricky. Let me think: For a plano-concave lens, the first radius R1 is negative because it's concave towards the incoming light. So the formula becomes:

1/f = (n_rel - 1) * ( -1/R )

Where n_rel is n_lens / n_medium.

But then f would be negative, indicating a diverging lens.

Wait, let's plug in numbers. Let's say the lens is made of glass with n_lens = 1.5, and when in air (n_medium =1), then n_rel = 1.5.

So 1/f = (1.5 -1) * (-1/R) = 0.5 * (-1/0.2) = -2.5 m^-1.

So f = -0.4 m. So the power D = 1/f = -2.5 diopters. But that's for a lens. But the question is about a mirror, so I'm not sure.

Wait, but the problem states that the mirror is in contact with air and water. So perhaps the mirror is acting as a lens, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, perhaps the mirror's curvature creates a situation where the surrounding medium affects the focal length.

At this point, I'm stuck. Let's try to think differently. The question is giving options where the power changes between air and water. So perhaps the correct approach is to model the mirror as a lens, calculate the power in each medium, and see which option matches.

But without knowing the lens material's refractive index, that's impossible. Wait, maybe the mirror's material has a refractive index, and when it's in a medium, it's as if it's a lens with that material.

Wait, perhaps the mirror is treated as a spherical interface between two media. So when the mirror is in air, the interface is between (say) glass (n=1.5) and air (n=1). When it's in water, it's between glass and water (n=1.33). But for a spherical mirror, the focal length is R/2, but if it's acting as a refracting surface, the focal length would be different.

Wait, perhaps the question is about a spherical interface, not a mirror. Because a spherical mirror would have its focal length determined by reflection, not refraction.

Wait, maybe the confusion comes from the term "refracting power". So perhaps the question is actually about a lens, not a mirror. Let me approach it as a lens.

Assume it's a biconcave lens with radius R = 20 cm. But no, the question says concave mirror, so perhaps it's plano-concave.

Wait, let's model it as a plano-concave lens. So the lensmaker's formula is:

1/f = (n - 1) * [1/R1 - 1/R2]

But for plano-concave, R2 is infinity, so 1/R2 is zero. R1 is the radius of curvature of the concave surface. Since it's concave, R1 is negative in the lensmaker's formula.

So 1/f = (n -1) * (1/R1) → 1/f = (n-1)(-1/R) because R1 = -R (R is positive, as given).

So 1/f = -(n-1)/R

So f = - R/(n-1)

The power D is 1/f, so D = -(n-1)/R

Wait, but R is in meters. Let me compute for R = 0.2 m.

In air, n_medium is 1, but wait, no: the formula uses the lens material's refractive index. Wait, wait, perhaps the formula is 1/f = (n_lens/n_medium -1) * (1/R1 - 1/R2)

So if the lens is made of a material with n_lens, and it's in a medium n_medium.

Wait, that makes more sense. So in air, n_medium =1, and the lens has n_lens = n. But the problem doesn't give n_lens. Hmm.

Wait, the problem says "the reflecting surface is in contact with air (n=1) and water (n=1.33)". So perhaps the mirror is acting as a lens with n_lens = 1 in air and 1.33 in water, which doesn't make sense because the mirror's material would have a fixed n.

I'm getting more confused. Another approach: perhaps the mirror's surface is considered as part of a lens. So when in air, the effective part of the lens has a certain focal length, and when in water, it's different.

Alternatively, perhaps the mirror is a glass slab with a concave surface, and when placed in different media, it acts as a lens. For example, in air, the glass has n=1.33, and in water, it's n=1.33 as well. So the (n_lens/n_medium) would be 1.33/1=1.33 in air, and 1.33/1.33=1 in water.

Wait, that could make sense. So the lens would have different powers in each medium.

So let's model this as a plano-concave lens made of glass (n=1.33) placed in air and then in water.

So in air (n_medium =1, n_lens=1.33):

1/f_air = (1.33/1 -1) * (1/R1 - 1/R2 )

R1 is the radius of the concave surface. Plano on the other side, so R2 = infinity. R1 is negative because it's concave towards the incoming light.

So 1/f_air = (0.33) * (1/(-0.2) - 0 ) → 0.33 * (-5) = -1.65 m^-1.

So f_air = -1/1.65 ≈ -0.606 m. So the power D_air = 1/f_air ≈ -1.65 diopters.

Wait, but that's negative, meaning diver
