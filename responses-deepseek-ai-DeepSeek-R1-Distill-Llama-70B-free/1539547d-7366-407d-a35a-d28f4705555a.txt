Question:

Use indirect truth tables to determine whether the following argument is valid. If the argument is invalid, choose an option which presents a counterexample. (There may be other counterexamples as well.)
E ⊃ (F ∨ ~G)
F ⊃ (~E ∨ ~G) / ~(E ≡ F)

Options:

A: Invalid. Counterexample when E is true, F is false and G is true
B: Valid
C: Invalid. Counterexample when E and G are true and F is false
D: Valid. No counterexample found
E: Invalid. Counterexample when E is false, F is true and G is false
F: Invalid. Counterexample when F and G are true and E is false
G: Invalid. Counterexample when E and F are true and G is false

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether this argument is valid using indirect truth tables. The argument has two premises and a conclusion. Let's break it down.

The premises are:
1. E ⊃ (F ∨ ~G)
2. F ⊃ (~E ∨ ~G)

And the conclusion is:
~(E ≡ F)

Hmm, so I remember that in logic, an argument is valid if whenever all the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. If I can find a situation where all premises are true but the conclusion is false, then the argument is invalid, and that situation would be a counterexample.

So the conclusion is ~(E ≡ F), which means E and F are not equivalent. E ≡ F is true when E and F have the same truth value, so the negation would be when E and F have opposite truth values. So the conclusion is asserting that E and F are not the same.

Wait, so the conclusion is true when E is true and F is false, or E is false and F is true.

Now, I need to check if the argument is valid. Let's think about how to approach this. An indirect truth table involves assuming that the premises are all true and the conclusion is false, and seeing if such a scenario is possible.

So if the conclusion is false, that would mean E ≡ F is true. So E and F have the same truth value. So either both E and F are true, or both are false.

So I'll check both possibilities where E and F are the same, and see if the premises can still hold. If yes, then that's a counterexample because the premises are true but the conclusion is false.

Let's consider the case where E and F are both true (E=T, F=T). Let's see what this implies for the premises.

First premise: E ⊃ (F ∨ ~G). If E is true, then F ∨ ~G must be true. Since F is true, F ∨ ~G is true regardless of G. So the first premise holds.

Second premise: F ⊃ (~E ∨ ~G). F is true, so ~E ∨ ~G must be true. But E is true, so ~E is false. Therefore, ~G must be true, which means G is false.

So in this scenario where E=T, F=T, G=F, both premises are true. But since E and F are both true, E ≡ F is true, so the conclusion (which is the negation) is false. That means the argument would be invalid because we have a case where premises are true, but the conclusion is false.

Wait, but let me check another scenario where E and F are both false. E=F=false.

First premise: E is false, so E ⊃ anything is automatically true. So the first premise holds regardless.

Second premise: F is false, so F ⊃ whatever is also automatically true. So the second premise holds as well.

In this case, E and F are both false, so E ≡ F is true, making the conclusion false again. So in both cases where E and F are the same, the premises can hold, making the conclusion false.

Therefore, the argument is invalid because there exists a counterexample where E and F are both true and G is false.

Wait, but the options given don't have that exact scenario. Let me look at the options again.

Option G says: Invalid. Counterexample when E and F are true and G is false.

Yes, that's exactly the scenario I considered. So the correct answer should be option G.

Alternatively, another possible counterexample is when E and F are both false. But looking at the options, that scenario isn't presented.

So the correct choice is option G.

To determine the validity of the argument using indirect truth tables, we analyze whether there exists a scenario where all premises are true, but the conclusion is false. The argument is:

1. **Premises**:
   - \( E \supset (F \lor \neg G) \)
   - \( F \supset (\neg E \lor \neg G) \)

2. **Conclusion**:
   - \( \neg (E \equiv F) \), which asserts that \( E \) and \( F \) are not equivalent. This means \( E \) and \( F \) must have opposite truth values.

To invalidate the argument, we assume the conclusion is false, i.e., \( E \equiv F \) is true. This happens in two cases:
- **Case 1**: \( E = \text{true}, F = \text{true} \)
  - First premise: \( E \supset (F \lor \neg G) \) is true because \( F = \text{true} \), making \( F \lor \neg G \) true regardless of \( G \).
  - Second premise: \( F \supset (\neg E \lor \neg G) \) requires \( \neg E \lor \neg G \) to be true. Since \( E = \text{true} \), \( \neg E = \text{false} \), so \( \neg G \) must be true, implying \( G = \text{false} \).
  - Here, both premises are true, but \( E \equiv F \) is true, making the conclusion \( \neg (E \equiv F) \) false. This is a valid counterexample.

- **Case 2**: \( E = \text{false}, F = \text{false} \)
  - First premise: \( E \supset (F \lor \neg G) \) is automatically true because \( E = \text{false} \).
  - Second premise: \( F \supset (\neg E \lor \neg G) \) is also automatically true because \( F = \text{false} \).
  - Again, both premises are true, but \( E \equiv F \) is true, making the conclusion false. This is another valid counterexample.

From the given options, **Option G** corresponds to the counterexample where \( E = \text{true}, F = \text{true}, G = \text{false} \). This demonstrates that the argument is invalid.

**Answer: G**
