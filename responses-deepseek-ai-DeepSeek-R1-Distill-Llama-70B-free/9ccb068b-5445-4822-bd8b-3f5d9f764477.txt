Question:

A man, his brother and his friend all discuss murdering the man's neighbor because the neighbor took some shots at the man's dog but he missed. They agree on a plan. They decided on strychnine poisoning, which the friend told them how to get and they went and got it. When they asked the friend to go forward in poisoning the victim, he refused, saying, "I'm was only here for planning and advice, but I never intended to commit murder." The man and his brother took the poison to a meeting with the neighbor, but he wouldn't drink. They were caught and arrested. The statute requires an overt act for criminal conspiracy. Which of the following most accurately states the criminal responsibility of each of the three men?

Options:

A: The man and his brother are guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder, and the friend is guilty of criminal conspiracy.
B: The man, his brother, and the friend are all guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder.
C: The man and his brother have committed criminal conspiracy and attempted murder.
D: The friend is guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder, but the man and his brother are not guilty.
E: The man and his brother are guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder, but the friend is guilty of nothing.
F: The friend is guilty of conspiracy, but not the man and his brother.
G: The man and his brother are guilty of conspiracy, while the friend is guilty of attempted murder.
H: The man and his brother are guilty of conspiracy but not attempted murder.
I: Only the man is guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder, while his brother and the friend are not guilty.
J: The man and his brother are guilty of attempted murder, but not conspiracy.

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about criminal conspiracy and attempted murder. Hmm, let me try to break this down. I'm a bit rusty on criminal law, but I'll give it a shot.

Alright, the scenario is that a man, his brother, and his friend are discussing murdering the man's neighbor. The neighbor shot at the man's dog but missed. So, they agree on a plan to use strychnine poisoning. The friend tells them how to get it, and they go get the poison. But when asked to actually poison the neighbor, the friend refuses, saying he was only there for planning and advice and never intended to commit murder.

Then, the man and his brother take the poison to a meeting with the neighbor, but the neighbor won't drink it. They get caught and arrested. The statute requires an overt act for criminal conspiracy.

The question is about the criminal responsibility of each of the three men. So, the options are A through J.

First, I need to recall the elements of conspiracy and attempted murder.

Conspiracy generally requires an agreement between two or more people to commit a crime, with the intent to carry it out, and an overt act in furtherance of that agreement. The overt act doesn't have to be the crime itself, just some act that shows the conspiracy is moving forward.

Attempted murder would require the specific intent to kill and a substantial step towards that goal. The act must be more than just preparation; it has to be something that shows a firm commitment to the crime.

In this case, all three initially agreed to the plan. The friend provided information on how to get strychnine, and they all went to get it. So, that's an overt act—acquiring the poison. However, the friend later refuses to go through with the actual poisoning, saying he didn't intend to commit murder.

Wait, but does the friend's initial participation count? He was part of the planning and provided material assistance by telling them where to get the poison. So, even if he later backed out, his initial actions could still make him part of the conspiracy, right?

But wait, when the friend refused, did he withdraw from the conspiracy? I think withdrawal can be a defense if done before the commission of any overt act. But in this case, they had already obtained the poison, which is an overt act. So, if he withdrew after the overt act, he's still liable for conspiracy.

So, each of the three agreed to the plan, and they took an overt act by getting the poison. So, all three are part of the conspiracy. But wait, the friend said he didn't intend to commit murder, only to plan and advise. Hmm, does that affect the conspiracy?

Conspiracy requires the intent to agree to commit the crime. If the friend never intended to go through with it, maybe he didn't have the specific intent. But wait, he participated in the planning and provided the means. So, maybe he's still guilty because he agreed to the conspiracy with the intent that the crime be committed, even if he didn't want to be the one to do it.

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The friend said he was only there for planning and advice, and didn't intend to commit murder. So, when they asked him to actually poison the victim, he refused. Does that mean he never had the intent to commit the crime, or just didn't want to perform the act himself?

In conspiracy, the intent required is the intent to agree to the commission of the crime. So, if the friend agreed to the plan with the intent that the others would carry it out, then he's part of the conspiracy. His refusal to perform the act doesn't negate the conspiracy because the overt act (getting the poison) had already been done.

So, all three would be guilty of conspiracy because they agreed and took an overt act. But what about attempted murder?

Attempted murder requires the specific intent to kill and a substantial step toward it. The man and his brother took the poison to the meeting and tried to get the neighbor to drink it. That's a substantial step, so they would be guilty of attempted murder. But the friend didn't take that step. He only provided the poison and planning. So, he didn't take the substantial step beyond the conspiracy. Therefore, he's guilty of conspiracy but not attempted murder.

Wait, but the friend helped them get the poison, which is the overt act for the conspiracy. But for attempted murder, the friend didn't take any steps beyond that. So, the man and brother are guilty of both conspiracy and attempted murder. The friend is guilty only of conspiracy.

Looking at the options, option A says: The man and his brother are guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder, and the friend is guilty of criminal conspiracy. That seems to fit.

Option E says the man and brother are guilty of both, and the friend guilty of nothing. But that can't be right because the friend was part of the conspiracy.

Option B says all three are guilty of both, which doesn't fit because the friend didn't attempt the murder.

So, the correct answer should be A.

The question revolves around the criminal responsibility of three individuals—a man, his brother, and their friend—under the doctrines of conspiracy and attempted murder. Conspiracy requires an agreement between two or more individuals to commit a crime, intent to carry it out, and an overt act in furtherance of the agreement. Attempted murder requires specific intent to kill and a substantial step toward that goal.

In this scenario, all three individuals agreed to a plan to murder the neighbor using strychnine poisoning. The friend provided information on how to obtain the poison, and the group acquired it, which constitutes an overt act for conspiracy. However, the friend later refused to participate in the actual poisoning, claiming he only intended to provide planning and advice. Despite his refusal, his earlier participation in the planning and the overt act of obtaining the poison makes him guilty of conspiracy.

The man and his brother, however, went further by taking the poison to the neighbor and attempting to get him to drink it. This constitutes a substantial step toward committing murder, making them guilty of both conspiracy and attempted murder. The friend, on the other hand, did not take any steps beyond the initial planning and the overt act of obtaining the poison, so he is not guilty of attempted murder.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Correct. The man and his brother are guilty of both conspiracy and attempted murder, while the friend is guilty only of conspiracy.
- **Option B**: Incorrect. The friend is not guilty of attempted murder, as he did not take a substantial step toward the crime.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The friend is guilty of conspiracy due to his participation in the planning and the overt act of obtaining the poison.

Thus, the most accurate answer is:

**A: The man and his brother are guilty of conspiracy and attempted murder, and the friend is guilty of criminal conspiracy.**
