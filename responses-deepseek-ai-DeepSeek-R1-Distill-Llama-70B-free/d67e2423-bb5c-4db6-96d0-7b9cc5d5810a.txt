Okay, so I've got this algebra problem to simplify: (5x + 3) minus 2 times (2x - 4). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that simplifying expressions involves distributing and combining like terms.

First, I'll write down the original expression again to make sure I have it right: (5x + 3) - 2(2x - 4). Wait, the minus sign before the 2 is important. I need to distribute that -2 across both terms inside the parentheses. 

Let me start by distributing the -2. So, -2 times 2x would be -4x, right? And then -2 times -4. Oh wait, a negative times a negative is a positive. So that should be +8. 

So after distributing, the expression becomes 5x + 3 - 4x + 8. Wait, let me make sure I did that correctly. The first part is (5x +3), then subtracting 2*(2x-4) becomes -4x +8. So yes, combining those, it's 5x +3 -4x +8.

Now I'll combine like terms. The terms with x are 5x and -4x. 5x minus 4x is x. Then the constants are 3 and 8. 3 plus 8 is 11. So putting those together, it's x + 11. 

Hmm, let me check the options. Option B is x +11, so that's probably the correct answer. But wait, let me double-check my steps because sometimes I might make a mistake in signs. 

Original expression: (5x +3) -2(2x-4). Distribute the -2: 5x +3 -4x +8. Combine 5x-4x to get x, and 3+8 is 11. Yep, that's correct. So the simplified form is x +11, which is option B.

To simplify the expression \((5x + 3) - 2(2x - 4)\), follow these steps:

1. **Distribute the \(-2\):**  
   \[
   (5x + 3) - 2(2x - 4) = 5x + 3 - 4x + 8
   \]

2. **Combine like terms:**  
   - Combine \(5x\) and \(-4x\):  
     \[
     5x - 4x = x
     \]
   - Combine \(3\) and \(8\):  
     \[
     3 + 8 = 11
     \]

3. **Write the simplified expression:**  
   \[
   x + 11
   \]

From the given options, the correct answer is **B: \(x + 11\)**.
