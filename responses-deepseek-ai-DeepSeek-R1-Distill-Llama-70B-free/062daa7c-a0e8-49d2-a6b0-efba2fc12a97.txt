Question:

What prevents the stomach from being digested by itsown secretions?

Options:

A: A thick layer of fat surrounds the stomach, providing protection from digestive acids.
B: Special bacteria in the stomach neutralize all digestive enzymes.
C: The stomach lining secretes an alkaline substance that counteracts the acid and prevents digestion.
D: The lining of the stomach secretes only hydrochloric acid and gastric juice.
E: The mucus layer, the permeability of the membranes and the continual replacement of the cells comprising the lining all help protect the underlying tissues from the action of proteolytic enzymes of the stomach and duodenum.
F: The stomach is coated with a layer of strong antibiotics that kill digestive enzymes.
G: The stomach lining is replaced every 10 to 15 days.
H: The stomach has a high permeability to hydrogen ions.
I: The stomach has a unique pH that prevents enzymes from being active.
J: Digestive enzymes in the stomach are only activated by food, so they do not attack the stomach lining.

Okay, so I've got this biology question here about the stomach and why it doesn't get digested by its own secretions. Hmm, interesting. I remember from my classes that the stomach produces a lot of acid and enzymes to break down food, but the stomach lining must have some protection against that. Otherwise, it'd digest itself, right?

Let me think about the options. Option A says a thick layer of fat protects the stomach. Wait, fat is more about insulation and energy storage. I don't think the stomach has a fat layer like that. Plus, if it did, it wouldn't directly prevent the acid from affecting the stomach lining. So A is probably not the right answer.

Option B suggests special bacteria neutralize the enzymes. But wait, the stomach is really acidic, right? I thought most bacteria can't survive there. And I don't remember anything about bacteria neutralizing enzymes in the stomach. So B might not be correct.

Option C says the stomach lining secretes an alkaline substance to counteract acid. I recall that the stomach lining does produce mucus, which is alkaline. This mucus creates a protective barrier. So C sounds plausible, but wait, I think there's more to it than just the alkaline substance. Maybe other factors too.

Option D claims the lining only secretes HCl and gastric juice. That doesn't make sense because if that's all, the stomach would digest itself. So D is probably incorrect.

Option E mentions a mucus layer, cell membrane permeability, and cell replacement. Oh, right, the stomach lining has a thick mucus layer that protects it. Also, the cells are rapidly replaced because they wear out quickly, which makes sense. And maybe the cell membranes don't allow the enzymes to penetrate. So E seems like a good candidate.

Option F talks about antibiotics killing enzymes. I don't think the stomach uses antibiotics. Plus, antibiotics target bacteria, not enzymes. So F is probably wrong.

Option G says the stomach lining is replaced every 10-15 days. I think that's true because the cells in the stomach lining have a high turnover rate. But is that the main reason? It's part of the reason, but maybe not the complete answer. Maybe it's part of a combination of factors, like in E.

Option H says the stomach is highly permeable to hydrogen ions. Wait, the stomach lining should be impermeable to H+ ions to prevent them from damaging the underlying tissue. So H might be incorrect because high permeability would allow H+ through, which is bad.

Option I claims the stomach has a unique pH preventing enzyme activity. But the stomach's pH is very acidic, which is perfect for enzyme activity. So I think this is the opposite of what actually happens. Unless the enzymes are inactive at that pH, but no, gastric enzymes like pepsin work best in acidic conditions.

Option J states that enzymes are only activated by food, so they don't attack the lining. But wait, enzymes like pepsin are produced in an inactive form called pepsinogen and get activated by HCl in the stomach. So if there's no food, they might still be present. But the lining's protection isn't because they're inactive when there's no food, but because of the protective layers. So J doesn't seem right.

So putting it all together, the stomach's protection involves multiple factors: the mucus layer, the tight junctions in the epithelial cells (permeability), and the quick cell turnover. So option E seems correct because it includes all these aspects.

The stomach's ability to avoid being digested by its own secretions involves multiple protective mechanisms. The stomach lining secretes a thick mucus layer that acts as a physical barrier against digestive acids and enzymes. Additionally, the epithelial cells of the stomach lining have tight junctions that prevent the permeation of hydrogen ions and digestive enzymes. Furthermore, the stomach lining cells are continually replaced due to their high turnover rate, ensuring that damaged cells are rapidly removed and replaced. These combined factors—mucus layer, membrane impermeability, and cell replacement—work together to protect the stomach from self-digestion.

Option E correctly identifies all these mechanisms, making it the most accurate answer.

Answer: E
