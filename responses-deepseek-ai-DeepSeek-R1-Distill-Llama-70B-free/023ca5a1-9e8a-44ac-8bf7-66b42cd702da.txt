Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about flexitime and its effects on organizations, based on a meta-analysis by Baltes and colleagues from 1999. Hmm, I need to figure out which option is the correct answer.

First, I should recall what flexitime is. Flexitime, or flexible working hours, allows employees to choose their start and end times, usually within a set framework. It's supposed to offer more work-life balance. So the question is asking which of the listed factors would benefit the most from implementing flexitime.

The options are: job stress, communication, productivity, overall job satisfaction, self-rated performance, absenteeism, employee turnover, company profitability, teamwork.

I remember that studies on flexible work arrangements often show positive effects on certain aspects. Let's break down each option.

A: Job stress. Flexible hours might reduce stress because employees can manage their personal life better. That seems plausible.

B: Communication within the organization. I'm not sure about this. If people have different schedules, maybe it could make communication a bit harder unless they have good systems in place. But I don't think flexitime's main benefit is here.

C: Productivity. Some studies suggest that flexible hours can increase productivity because employees can work when they're most effective. But it might vary depending on the job type.

D: Overall job satisfaction. Yes, this rings a bell. When employees have more control over their time, they tend to be more satisfied with their jobs. I think this is a strong candidate.

E: Self-rated performance. Employees might feel they perform better, but I'm not sure if flexitime directly impacts their actual performance ratings as much as their satisfaction.

F: Absenteeism. Flexitime might reduce absenteeism because employees can take care of personal matters without needing to take a whole day off. That makes sense.

G: Employee turnover. Satisfied employees are less likely to leave, so if flexitime increases job satisfaction, it would reduce turnover. But is that the greatest effect?

H: Company profitability. This would depend on multiple factors, including productivity and employee retention. It's possible, but maybe not the most direct impact.

I: Teamwork. If people are on different schedules, teamwork might be a bit more challenging. Unless the team is remote or uses good communication tools, but I don't think this is the main benefit.

So, the options I'm considering are A, C, D, F, G.

Let me think about which effect is the strongest. I've read that flexitime is linked to higher job satisfaction. For example, when employees can balance work and personal life better, they're happier overall in their jobs. So D could be the answer.

But wait, I should also consider absenteeism. Flexitime can give employees the flexibility to handle personal appointments without taking a sick day. That would reduce absenteeism. So F is also a possibility.

Which one is the greatest beneficial effect? The question is about a meta-analysis, which aggregates many studies. Meta-analyses often find that some effects are more consistent than others.

I think job satisfaction (D) is a common outcome measured in such studies, and flexible hours are often cited as improving satisfaction. Absenteeism reduction is also a factor, but maybe the effect on satisfaction is stronger or more consistent.

Alternatively, maybe the effect on turnover is significant. If people are happier, they stay longer. So G could be a contender, but the question is about the greatest effect.

Hmm, I'm a bit torn between D, F, and G. But from what I remember, job satisfaction is one of the primary outcomes that flexitime affects positively.

Wait, another angle: the question says "the greatest beneficial effects". So which effect is largest in magnitude? Maybe job satisfaction is the most directly impacted.

Alternatively, maybe it's absenteeism. If people have more flexibility, they can avoid taking days off, so absenteeism would drop more noticeably.

I'm a bit confused. Let me try to recall any specific studies or findings. I remember a study where flexible work arrangements were linked to lower turnover intentions, but the effect on job satisfaction was also significant.

Wait, the Baltes meta-analysis specifically. I think their work found that flexitime had a significant positive effect on job satisfaction. Maybe that's the case.

So, putting it all together, the answer is D: overall job satisfaction.

The question asks about the greatest beneficial effects of instituting flexitime in an organization, based on a meta-analysis by Baltes and colleagues (1999). Flexitime, or flexible working hours, is designed to improve work-life balance and has been studied for its impact on various organizational outcomes. 

Analyzing the options:

- **A: Job stress** - Flexitime could reduce stress by allowing better personal time management, but this is not its primary benefit.
- **B: Communication within the organization** - Flexitime might complicate communication if schedules vary, so this is unlikely to be the main benefit.
- **C: Productivity** - While flexibility can increase productivity for some, this effect can vary depending on the job type and individual differences.
- **D: Overall job satisfaction** - This is a strong candidate, as studies consistently show that flexitime improves job satisfaction by giving employees more control over their time.
- **E: Self-rated performance** - While employees might feel they perform better, this is not as directly tied to flexitime as job satisfaction.
- **F: Absenteeism** - Flexitime can reduce absenteeism by allowing employees to handle personal matters without taking full days off, but this may not be the strongest effect.
- **G: Employee turnover** - Satisfied employees are less likely to leave, but this is a secondary effect of improved job satisfaction.
- **H: Company profitability** - This depends on multiple factors and is not the most direct impact of flexitime.
- **I: Teamwork** - Flexitime might pose challenges for teamwork unless communication systems are strong, so this is unlikely to be a primary benefit.

The meta-analysis by Baltes and colleagues (1999) is most likely to highlight **overall job satisfaction** as the greatest beneficial effect, as this is a consistent and direct outcome of implementing flexitime. While absenteeism and employee turnover may also improve, the effect on job satisfaction is typically the most pronounced and widely documented.
