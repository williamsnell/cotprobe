Question:

A previously healthy 27-year-old nulligravid woman comes to the emergency department because of a 2-day history of moderate-to-severe pain and swelling of the left labia. She is sexually active and uses condoms inconsistently. Her temperature is 37.2°C (99°F), pulse is 92/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 115/75 mm Hg. Pelvic examination shows a 4 x 3-cm, tender, fluctuant mass medial to the left labium majus compromising the introital opening. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Options:

A: Administration of intravenous vancomycin
B: Incision and drainage
C: Administration of intravenous ceftriaxone
D: Administration of intravenous metronidazole
E: Observation and re-evaluation in 24 hours
F: Administration of oral antibiotics
G: Administration of intravenous penicillin G
H: Ultrasound-guided needle aspiration of the mass
I: Initiation of antiviral therapy
J: Surgical excision of the mass

Okay, so I've got this medical question here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let's see what the scenario is.

The patient is a 27-year-old woman who's nulligravid, which means she hasn't been pregnant before. She comes to the emergency department with a 2-day history of moderate-to-severe pain and swelling in her left labia. She's sexually active and uses condoms inconsistently, so her sexual history might be relevant here.

Looking at her vital signs: temperature is 37.2°C, which is just a bit above normal, but not a high fever. Her pulse is 92, which is slightly elevated, respirations 18, and blood pressure 115/75. Nothing too out of the ordinary there, but I remember that signs of infection might not always present with high fever, especially early on.

The pelvic exam shows a 4x3 cm tender, fluctuant mass medial to the left labium majus, and it's compromising the introital opening. So, the mass is near the entrance of the vagina, which could cause some obstruction or discomfort. The fact that it's fluctuant makes me think it's a fluid-filled structure, maybe an abscess or cyst.

I'm trying to think about the possible causes here. She's sexually active with inconsistent condom use, so STIs are a consideration. However, her symptoms are localized to a mass, which makes me think of a Bartholin gland abscess or cyst. Bartholin glands are located on each side of the vaginal opening and can sometimes become blocked, leading to abscess formation. They can become infected, often with bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, or sometimes STIs like gonorrhea or chlamydia.

Bartholin abscesses typically present as painful, swollen masses that can grow quite large. They can cause significant discomfort and may interfere with walking or sitting. The treatment usually involves drainage because antibiotics alone might not resolve the abscess quickly, especially if it's large.

Looking at the options, let's go through them:

A: Administer IV vancomycin. Vancomycin is used for Gram-positive infections, like MRSA. But unless we know the cause, this might be jumping the gun.

B: Incision and drainage. That's a common treatment for abscesses, especially if they're large and fluctuant. It would relieve the pressure and pain, and also allow for culture to identify the bacteria.

C: IV ceftriaxone. Ceftriaxone is a cephalosporin, broad-spectrum. It's often used for gonorrhea. But again, if there's an abscess, antibiotics alone may not be sufficient.

D: IV metronidazole. That's for anaerobic infections, like bacterial vaginosis or trichomonas. Not sure if that's the main issue here.

E: Observation and re-evaluation. Probably not the best choice since she's in significant pain and the mass is large.

F: Oral antibiotics. Maybe, but again, the presence of an abscess might need drainage first.

G: IV penicillin G. That's for syphilis or other infections, but not sure if that's the case here.

H: Ultrasound-guided needle aspiration. Aspiration might be done, but sometimes incision and drainage is more effective, especially for larger abscesses.

I: Antiviral therapy. That would be for herpes or other viral infections. The presentation here doesn't strongly suggest that.

J: Surgical excision. That might be an option for recurrent Bartholin cysts, but initial management is usually drainage.

So, considering all this, the most appropriate next step is likely incision and drainage of the abscess. This would provide immediate relief, and a sample can be sent for culture to guide antibiotic therapy. She might also need antibiotics post-procedure, but the primary step is drainage.

I should also think about whether she needs to be admitted or can be treated as an outpatient. Since the abscess is large (4x3 cm) and causing significant symptoms, drainage in the ED or under anesthesia might be necessary. Sometimes, if the abscess is too big or the patient can't tolerate the procedure, they might need to be admitted, but often it's done in the ED with local anesthesia.

So the answer should be B: Incision and drainage.

The patient is a 27-year-old nulligravid woman presenting with a 2-day history of pain and swelling in the left labia. She is sexually active with inconsistent condom use, raising the possibility of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). However, the physical examination reveals a 4x3 cm tender, fluctuant mass medial to the left labium majus, which is compromising the introital opening. This presentation is most consistent with a Bartholin gland abscess, a common condition where the Bartholin gland becomes blocked and infected, often with bacteria such as *Staphylococcus aureus*, *Escherichia coli*, or less commonly, STI pathogens like *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* or *Chlamydia trachomatis*.

Bartholin abscesses typically require prompt treatment to relieve pain and prevent further complications. Incision and drainage (I&D) is the standard of care for large, fluctuant abscesses, as it provides immediate relief and allows for bacterial culture to guide antibiotic therapy. While antibiotics may be necessary post-procedure, they alone are insufficient to resolve a large abscess.

Among the options provided:

- **A, C, D, F, G**: These involve antibiotics, which are not the primary treatment for a large, fluctuant abscess.
- **E**: Observation is inappropriate given the patient's pain and the size of the abscess.
- **H**: Ultrasound-guided needle aspiration may be less effective for large abscesses compared to I&D.
- **I, J**: Antiviral therapy and surgical excision are not indicated in this acute setting.

Thus, the most appropriate next step is **incision and drainage** of the abscess.

Answer: B
