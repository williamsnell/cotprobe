Question:

Which statement about protein digestion and absorption is most correct?


Options:

A: The products of protein digestion may be absorbed as free amino acids or as di- or tripeptides
B: Protein digestion and absorption does not involve any brush-border enzymes.
C: Protein digestion only takes place in the stomach
D: The products of digestion of dietary protein by luminal and brush-border enzymes are only absorbed by one of the 14 different amino acid transporters
E: Gastric digestion of all proteins is equally efficient because of the grinding action of the antrum
F: Gastric zymogenic (chief) cells produce and secrete amylase, this initiates the process of protein digestion
G: Gastric zymogenic (chief) cells produce and secrete chymotrypsin, elastase and carboxypeptidase A and this initiates the process of protein digestion
H: Gastric digestion of all proteins is less efficient due to the grinding action of the antrum
I: All products of dietary protein digestion are absorbed by the same amino acid transporter
J: The products of protein digestion are only absorbed as di- or tripeptides

Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about protein digestion and absorption. Hmm, I remember from my biology classes that proteins are broken down into smaller units like amino acids, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact details. Let me think through each option carefully.

The question is asking which statement is the most correct about protein digestion and absorption. Let's go through the options one by one.

Option A: The products of protein digestion may be absorbed as free amino acids or as di- or tripeptides. I think this is correct. I remember that some amino acids are absorbed as single units, but sometimes they're in pairs or triplets. The small intestine uses different transport mechanisms for these. So A could be a good candidate.

Option B: Protein digestion and absorption doesn't involve any brush-border enzymes. Wait, I thought brush-border enzymes are part of the small intestine's microvilli. These enzymes break down larger molecules into smaller ones right before absorption. So if B says no brush-border enzymes are involved, that's probably wrong because there are enzymes like aminopeptidases in the brush border that help digest proteins.

Option C: Protein digestion only takes place in the stomach. No, that's not right. The stomach starts the digestion with pepsin, but most of the protein digestion happens in the small intestine with enzymes like trypsin and chymotrypsin from the pancreas, plus the brush-border enzymes.

Option D: The products are only absorbed by one of the 14 amino acid transporters. No, I think each transporter is specific for certain amino acids. There are multiple transporters, maybe 14, each handling different types, so this would mean each product uses a different one. So D would be incorrect because it says only one is used.

Option E: Gastric digestion of all proteins is equally efficient because of the antrum grinding. Wait, the antrum is part of the stomach, involved in mixing, but I don't think it grinds all proteins equally. Some proteins might be more resistant, so E doesn't sound right.

Option F: Gastric chief cells produce amylase, initiating protein digestion. Amylase is for carbs, right? Chief cells produce pepsinogen, which becomes pepsin in the stomach. So F is wrong because it's amylase instead.

Option G: Chief cells produce chymotrypsin, etc. No, those enzymes are from the pancreas, not the stomach. Chief cells in the stomach make pepsin. So G is incorrect.

Option H: Gastric digestion is less efficient because of the antrum. I'm not sure about this. The antrum's grinding action probably helps, but I'm not certain how efficient it is. The statement says digestion is less efficient, which doesn't ring a bell. I think H is probably wrong.

Option I: All products use the same transporter. No, because there are multiple transporters for different amino acids. I remember that there are specific carriers, so I is incorrect.

Option J: Products are only absorbed as di/tripeptides. I thought some are absorbed as amino acids and others as the peptides, so J is wrong because it says only.

So, circling back, the correct answer is probably A. It correctly states that absorption can be as free amino acids or as di/tripeptides. That makes sense because I remember small peptides being taken in by specific transporters and then broken down into amino acids inside the cells before entering the bloodstream.

The correct answer is **A**. 

- **Option A** is correct because the products of protein digestion can be absorbed as free amino acids or as di- or tripeptides. This aligns with the known mechanisms of protein absorption in the small intestine, where both free amino acids and small peptides are absorbed via specific transporters.

- **Option B** is incorrect because brush-border enzymes, such as aminopeptidases, play a role in protein digestion by breaking down peptides into amino acids at the intestinal surface.

- **Option C** is incorrect because protein digestion begins in the stomach with pepsin but is primarily completed in the small intestine by pancreatic enzymes and brush-border enzymes.

- **Option D** is incorrect because there are multiple amino acid transporters, each specific to different types of amino acids, rather than a single transporter being responsible for all absorption.

- **Option E** is incorrect because not all proteins are equally susceptible to gastric digestion; some are more resistant to pepsin.

- **Option F** is incorrect because chief cells produce pepsinogen, not amylase, and amylase is involved in carbohydrate digestion.

- **Option G** is incorrect because chymotrypsin, elastase, and carboxypeptidase A are pancreatic enzymes, not products of gastric chief cells.

- **Option H** is incorrect because the antrum's grinding action facilitates gastric digestion rather than making it less efficient.

- **Option I** is incorrect because multiple transporters are involved in amino acid absorption, not a single one.

- **Option J** is incorrect because absorption occurs as both free amino acids and small peptides, not exclusively as di- or tripeptides.

Thus, the most correct statement is **A**.
