Answer the following multiple choice question, selecting from the answer A through to J. After thinking, reply directly with your answer. 

The last character of your response must be the letter you have chosen.

Question:

Both food and air pass through the pharynx. Explain how these are channeled into the proper tubes so that the food goes into the stomach and the air goes to the lungs.

Options:

A: Air is directed into the lungs by the bronchial sphincter, while food is funneled into the esophagus by the esophageal sphincter
B: When we swallow, the larynx moves up so that the glottis is closed by the epiglottis and the food or liquid passes into the esophagus behind the trachea. Breathing ceases momentarily during swallowing.
C: A flap called the tracheal flap opens and closes to direct food and air into the correct tubes
D: Food and air passages are controlled by a series of muscular valves that open and close in response to swallowing
E: The tongue pushes food into the esophagus, while a muscular reflex diverts air into the trachea
F: The nasal passage contracts to prevent food from entering the lungs while swallowing
G: The diaphragm adjusts its position to guide food and air into the esophagus or trachea, respectively
H: The larynx contracts to direct food and air into the appropriate tubes
I: Food and air are directed by the uvula into the appropriate tubes
J: Food and air are separated by cilia in the pharynx

Okay, so I need to figure out this biology question about how food and air are directed into the right tubes. Hmm, I remember that the pharynx is a shared pathway for both the digestive and respiratory systems. So when we swallow, both food and air pass through there, but obviously, they need to go different ways.

Wait, the question is asking how they are channeled correctly. I think when you swallow, there's a mechanism that prevents food from going into the trachea and instead directs it to the esophagus. Oh right, the epiglottis! I remember it's like a flap that covers the opening to the trachea when you swallow.

So when you swallow, the larynx moves up. The epiglottis, which is attached to the larynx, then closes the glottis, which is the opening into the trachea. That way, food can't get in there and instead goes down the esophagus behind the trachea. Also, during this action, breathing stops momentarily because the airway is blocked. That makes sense because you can't breathe and swallow at the same time.

Looking at the options, option B says exactly that. It mentions the larynx moving up, the glottis closing with the epiglottis, and breathing stopping. So that's probably the correct answer.

Wait, let me check the other options to be sure. Option A talks about bronchial and esophageal sphincters. I'm not sure about a bronchial sphincter; maybe that's not right. Option C mentions a tracheal flap, which I don't think is the term used here. It's the epiglottis, not a tracheal flap.

Option D says it's controlled by muscular valves. That sounds a bit off because the main structure involved is the epiglottis, which is a flap, not a series of valves. Option E suggests the tongue pushes food into the esophagus. While the tongue does help move food, it's not the main mechanism for directing it into the esophagus.

Option F talks about the nasal passage contracting. No, that's not it. The nasal passages are separate from this process. Option G involves the diaphragm, but the diaphragm is more about breathing and separating the chest and abdominal cavities, not directing food and air during swallowing.

Option H says the larynx contracts, but it's more accurate that the larynx moves upward, causing the epiglottis to close the glottis. Option I refers to the uvula, which I think is involved in preventing food from entering the nasal cavity, not the trachea. And option J mentions cilia separating them, which doesn't seem right because cilia are more for moving mucus in the respiratory tract.

The correct answer is **B**. When swallowing, the larynx moves upward, causing the epiglottis to close the glottis, which prevents food from entering the trachea and directs it into the esophagus. During this process, breathing momentarily ceases. Other options either misidentify the structures involved or describe incorrect mechanisms.

Answer: B
