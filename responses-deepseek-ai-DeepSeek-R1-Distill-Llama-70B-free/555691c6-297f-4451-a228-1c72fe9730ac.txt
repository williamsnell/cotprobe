Okay, so I've got this chemistry problem here, and I'm trying to figure it out step by step. Let me read it again: We've got a mixture of 0.36 moles of aluminum and 0.36 moles of oxygen, and when they're ignited, they form aluminum oxide. The reaction is 4Al + 3O2 → 2Al2O3. The question is asking how many moles of Al2O3 can be formed, and which substance is in excess, along with how much.

Hmm, I remember this is a stoichiometry problem. So I think I need to find out which reactant is the limiting reagent because that will determine how much product is formed. The limiting reagent is the one that runs out first, so the other would be in excess.

First, I should write down the balanced equation again: 4Al + 3O2 → 2Al2O3. So the mole ratio of Al to O2 is 4:3. That means for every 4 moles of Al, we need 3 moles of O2.

The given moles are both 0.36. So Al is 0.36 and O2 is 0.36. Let's see, how much of each would react completely.

Let me calculate how much O2 is needed to react with all the Al. So if I have 0.36 moles of Al, how much O2 do I need? Using the ratio, for 4 moles Al, 3 moles O2. So moles O2 needed = (3/4) * moles Al.

So that's (3/4) * 0.36 = 0.27 moles of O2. But wait, do I have that much O2? I have exactly 0.36 moles of O2. So 0.27 is less than 0.36. So O2 is in excess, and Al is the limiting reagent because it will run out first.

Wait, no, wait. Alternatively, maybe I should see how much Al is needed for the O2. Let me do that as a check. So for 3 moles of O2, you need 4 moles of Al. So moles Al needed = (4/3) * moles O2. So (4/3)*0.36 = 0.48 moles of Al. But I only have 0.36 moles of Al. So Al is less than what's needed to react with all the O2. So yes, Al is the limiting reactant.

So the reaction will stop once all the Al is consumed.

Now, let's find out how much Al2O3 is produced. From the equation, 4 moles Al produce 2 moles Al2O3. So the mole ratio is 4:2, which simplifies to 2:1. So for every mole of Al consumed, half a mole of Al2O3 is formed.

So moles of Al2O3 = (2/4) * moles of Al that reacted. Since all 0.36 moles of Al react, that's (2/4)*0.36 = 0.18 moles of Al2O3.

Now, what's left of the O2? Since O2 was in excess. Let me calculate how much O2 was consumed.

The reaction uses 3 moles O2 for every 4 moles Al. So O2 consumed = (3/4)*0.36 = 0.27 moles. So initial O2 was 0.36, so subtract 0.27 gives 0.09 moles O2 remaining.

So the product is 0.18 moles Al2O3, with 0.09 moles O2 left, which is in excess.

Looking at the options, option B says 0.18 moles of Al2O3 and 0.09 moles O2 in excess. Option C says 0.18 Al2O3 and 0.18 Al in excess, which doesn't make sense because Al is the limiting reactant, so it's all used up. Option E says no excess, which is incorrect. So the correct answer should be option B.

To determine how many moles of Al₂O₃ can be formed and identify the excess reactant, we analyze the reaction:

**Reaction:**  
\[ 4\text{Al} + 3\text{O}_2 \rightarrow 2\text{Al}_2\text{O}_3 \]

### Step 1: Identify the limiting reagent
- **Mole ratio of Al to O₂:** From the balanced equation, 4 moles of Al react with 3 moles of O₂.  
- **Moles of O₂ needed to react with 0.36 moles of Al:**  
  \[
  \text{Moles of O}_2 = \frac{3}{4} \times 0.36 = 0.27 \, \text{moles}.
  \]  
  Since 0.27 moles of O₂ are required and 0.36 moles of O₂ are available, O₂ is in excess, and Al is the limiting reagent.

### Step 2: Calculate moles of Al₂O₃ formed
- From the balanced equation, 4 moles of Al produce 2 moles of Al₂O₃.  
- **Moles of Al₂O₃ formed:**  
  \[
  \text{Moles of Al}_2\text{O}_3 = \frac{2}{4} \times 0.36 = 0.18 \, \text{moles}.
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate excess O₂
- **Moles of O₂ consumed:**  
  \[
  \text{Moles of O}_2 = \frac{3}{4} \times 0.36 = 0.27 \, \text{moles}.
  \]  
- **Excess O₂:**  
  \[
  \text{Excess O}_2 = 0.36 - 0.27 = 0.09 \, \text{moles}.
  \]

### Final Answer
- **Moles of Al₂O₃ formed:** 0.18 moles.  
- **Excess reactant:** 0.09 moles of O₂.

### Correct Option
**B: 0.18 moles of Al₂O₃, 0.09 moles of O₂ in excess.**
