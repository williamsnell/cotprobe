Okay, so I'm trying to figure out the right diagnosis for this patient. Let's see. The patient is a 22-year-old man who was brought in by his father. Over the past six weeks, he's quit his job as a restaurant manager, become withdrawn, and spends most of his time in his room watching TV. He also reports receiving messages from aliens through the TV.

Hmm, so the key points here are his social withdrawal, quitting his job, and the delusion about messages from aliens. I remember that in DSM-IV, certain diagnoses require specific symptoms and durations.

First, let's think about Schizophrenia. Schizophrenia requires at least six months of symptoms, including at least one month of active-phase symptoms like delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech, etc. But this patient has only been symptomatic for six weeks, which is less than six months. So maybe it's not schizophrenia yet. But I also remember that the DSM-IV has a specifier for the duration; like, if it's longer than a month but less than six months, perhaps it's Schizophreniform Disorder.

Wait, yes, Schizophreniform Disorder is when the symptoms meet the criteria for schizophrenia but last between one month and six months. So that's an option here. The patient has had symptoms for six weeks, which is more than a month. So that fits.

Another option could be Brief Reactive Psychosis. I think that's when the psychotic symptoms last for less than a month, usually in response to a stressful event. But this patient's symptoms have been going on for six weeks, which is longer than a month, so Brief Reactive Psychosis might not fit.

Paranoid Personality Disorder is characterized by a long-standing pattern of distrust and suspiciousness, but I don't think it includes psychotic symptoms like delusions. So that's probably not it.

Bipolar Disorder? Well, if he had manic episodes, but the info doesn't mention any mood episodes, just withdrawal and delusions. So probably not.

Major Depressive Disorder could have psychotic features, but the primary symptoms here are more about psychosis and social withdrawal rather than depressed mood or loss of interest in activities. Although the social withdrawal could be part of depression, the presence of delusions makes me think more towards a psychotic disorder.

Dissociative Identity Disorder involves multiple identities, which isn't mentioned here. Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder is about obsessions and compulsions, which isn't the case here. Antisocial Personality Disorder is about disregard for others' rights, which doesn't fit either.

So putting it all together, the patient has delusions (receiving messages from aliens) and significant social/occupational dysfunction, with the symptoms lasting six weeks. That points towards Schizophreniform Disorder, which is option E.

Wait, but could it be Schizophrenia? No, because the duration is less than six months. So the correct answer would be E, Schizophreniform Disorder.

The patient is a 22-year-old man presenting with a six-week history of social withdrawal, quitting his job, and delusions of receiving messages from aliens through the TV. The key considerations are the duration of symptoms and the presence of psychotic features. Schizophrenia requires at least six months of symptoms, which is not met here. Schizophreniform Disorder fits as it involves symptoms meeting schizophrenia criteria but lasting between one month and six months. Brief Reactive Psychosis is ruled out because the symptoms exceed one month. Other options like Paranoid Personality Disorder, Bipolar Disorder, and Major Depressive Disorder do not align with the primary psychotic symptoms described. 

The most appropriate diagnosis is Schizophreniform Disorder.
