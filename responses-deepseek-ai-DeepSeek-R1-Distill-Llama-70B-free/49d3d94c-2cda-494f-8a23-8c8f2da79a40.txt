Okay, so I have this question about holograms and how changing the wavelength of light affects the reconstructed image. Hmm, let me try to think through this. 

I remember that holography involves recording the interference pattern of light waves. When you make a hologram, you split a laser into two beams: the object beam and the reference beam. They interfere, and that interference pattern is recorded on the hologram.

Now, when reconstructing the image, you shine the reference beam (or similar) through the hologram. The light diffracts off the hologram's pattern, recreating the original object wave. This should produce both a real image and a virtual image, but I think the position of these images depends on the wavelength used during reconstruction.

The question says the hologram was made with 600 nm (orange) light and then viewed with 500 nm (green) light. I need to find how the image distances change. 

Wait, I think the key here is the relationship between the wavelength and the image distance. I remember something about the image distance being proportional to the wavelength. Oh right, because the interference pattern's spacing (the fringes) is determined by the wavelength. So when you change the wavelength, the way the light diffracts changes, altering the image position.

I think the formula relates the original wavelength (λ1) and the new wavelength (λ2) to the image distances. If d1 is the original image distance and d2 is the new one, then d2 = d1 * (λ2 / λ1). Or wait, maybe it's the ratio of λ2 to λ1 multiplied by d1.

Wait, no, another thought. I recall that when the reconstruction wavelength is shorter, the image might move closer or farther. Let me think about diffraction. The diffraction angle depends on the wavelength. So if λ decreases (from 600 to 500 nm), the diffraction angle would decrease, meaning the image might be formed at a different position.

In the original setup, the object distance is, say, do. When you use the same wavelength, the image is at do, maybe? Or wait, perhaps the image distance depends on the wavelength ratio. 

Wait, maybe the image distance when reconstructed with a different wavelength is given by (λ2 / λ1) times the original image distance. So if the original was made with λ1=600 nm, and we're using λ2=500 nm, then the image distance d2 = d1 * (500/600) = (5/6) d1.

But wait, what's the original image distance? When you create the hologram, the image is reconstructed at the same distance as the object was during recording. So if the object was at distance do, the image would form at do when using the same wavelength. But when you change the wavelength, it's scaled by λ2/λ1.

So in this case, the image distance would be (500/600)*do, which is (5/6) do. So the reconstructed image distance is 5/6 times the object distance.

Looking at the options, option F says (5/6) the object distance. Option I is 5/4, which would be if we used a longer wavelength. So when λ2 is smaller than λ1, the image distance is shorter than the original. So the correct answer should be F.

When a hologram is created with light of wavelength \( \lambda_1 = 600 \, \text{nm} \) and reconstructed with light of wavelength \( \lambda_2 = 500 \, \text{nm} \), the image distance changes due to the dependence of diffraction on the wavelength. The relationship between the image distances is given by:

\[
d_2 = d_1 \cdot \frac{\lambda_2}{\lambda_1}
\]

Here, \( d_1 \) is the original image distance (equal to the object distance during recording), and \( d_2 \) is the new image distance. Substituting the values:

\[
d_2 = d_1 \cdot \frac{500}{600} = d_1 \cdot \frac{5}{6}
\]

Thus, the reconstructed image distance is \( \frac{5}{6} \) times the object distance. This corresponds to option **F**.
