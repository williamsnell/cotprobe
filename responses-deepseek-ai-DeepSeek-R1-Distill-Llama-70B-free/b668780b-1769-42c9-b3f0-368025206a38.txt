Question:

As part of an externship program conducted by his law school, a law student went to work for a lawyer as a clerk. After six months, the lawyer was very impressed with the law student's work. He called the law student into his office and told him, "I know you were only to work for me for six months in exchange for credit in your law school extemship program. However, I'd like you to stay on as a clerk. I'll pay you $25 an hour for any work you do for me between now and the bar exam. In addition, if you put in a minimum of 10 hours per week during that time, I promise to hire you full-time as an associate when you pass the bar exam. " The attorney then reduced this agreement to writing, which both he and the law student signed. The law student continued to work for the lawyer throughout the rest of his law school career and while he was studying for the bar exam. During that time, the law student always worked a minimum of 10 hours per week. While the law student was awaiting the results of the bar exam, his uncle passed away and left him a large apartment building. The law student decided he did not want to practice law but wanted to spend all of his time managing the apartment building. He told his roommate, a fellow law student who was awaiting his bar results, about his plans and told the roommate he would assign to the roommate the right to be hired by the lawyer as an associate, in exchange for $100. The roommate paid the $100 to the law student, who then executed a written assignment of the right to be hired by the lawyer as an associate. The roommate passed the bar exam, but the lawyer refused to hire him as an associate. Which of the following is the most accurate statement regarding the legal effect of this assignment?

Options:

A: The lawyer would be required to recognize the validity of the assignment, because the roommate passed the bar exam and is therefore qualified.
B: The lawyer would not be required to recognize the validity of the assignment, because neither the rights nor the duties under a personal service contract are properly assignable.
C: The lawyer would not be required to recognize the validity of the assignment, because the original contract was between the lawyer and the law student, not the roommate.
D: The lawyer would be required to recognize the validity of the assignment, but would be entitled to demand adequate assurances of performance from the roommate as to the latter's willingness and professional capacity to perform satisfactory work.
E: The lawyer would be required to recognize the validity of the assignment, but only if the roommate can prove he is capable of performing the duties of an associate.
F: The lawyer would not be required to recognize the validity of the assignment, because the original agreement was not intended to be assignable.
G: The lawyer would not be required to recognize the validity of the assignment, because the assignment was made in exchange for money, altering the original terms of the agreement.
H: The lawyer would be required to recognize the validity of the assignment, but would be entitled to demand adequate assurances of performance from the roommate as to the latter's willingness and financial capacity to perform satisfactory work.
I: The lawyer would not be required to recognize the validity of the assignment of rights, because a contract to make a future assignment of a right is not an assignment.
J: The lawyer would be required to recognize the validity of the assignment so that the roommate would be entitled to be hired as an associate.

Okay, so I've got this contracts question here, and I need to figure it out step by step. Let's start by understanding the scenario.

So, there's a law student who was clerking for a lawyer as part of an externship program. The lawyer was impressed and offered him a deal: stay on as a clerk getting paid $25 an hour, and if he works at least 10 hours a week until the bar exam, the lawyer will hire him full-time as an associate once he passes the bar. They put this agreement in writing and both signed it. The student worked the required hours, so he fulfilled his end.

But then, the student inherits an apartment building and decides he doesn't want to practice law. He tells his roommate, who's also a law student, about this and offers to assign his right to be hired by the lawyer for $100. The roommate pays, and they execute a written assignment. Now, the roommate passes the bar, but the lawyer refuses to hire him. The question is about the legal effect of this assignment.

The options are A through J, each giving a different outcome. I need to determine which is correct.

First, I remember that contract rights can generally be assigned unless there's a specific reason they can't. So, what are the exceptions? One big exception is personal service contracts. If the contract involves personal services, the duties can't be assigned because it's based on the individual's unique skills or relationship. But here, the lawyer is promising a future position as an associate, not the current clerking job. So is this a personal service contract?

Wait, the original agreement was for the student to work as a clerk, which is a form of personal service. But the promise to hire as an associate is a future position. So, the right that's being assigned is the right to be hired in the future, not the current clerking services.

So, the question is whether the right to future employment can be assigned. I think that such a right is considered a contractual right, and unless the contract prohibits assignment, it's assignable. But wait, is future employment considered a personal service contract?

Hmm. Personal service contracts are where the services are based on the individual's unique abilities or talents. If the lawyer agreed to hire the student because of the student's specific qualities, then assigning that right might not be allowed because the lawyer might not want to hire someone else. But if the agreement is more about the offer to hire upon certain conditions (like passing the bar and working hours), maybe it's not a personal service contract.

Another angle: the original agreement was between the lawyer and the student. The student is assigning his right to the roommate. So, the lawyer's obligation is to hire the student upon passing the bar, but the student is assigning that right. So, the roommate steps into the student's shoes.

Wait, but can the lawyer refuse? Because the lawyer didn't agree to the assignment. So, the issue is whether the assignment is valid.

I recall that the UCC (Uniform Commercial Code) allows for assignment unless it's prohibited. But this is a service contract, so maybe common law applies. At common law, most contract rights are assignable unless:

1. The contract prohibits assignment.
2. The rights are personal and cannot be transferred because they depend on the individual's unique skills or relationship (like a famous singer can't assign their performance obligation).
3. Assigning would materially change the duty or risk of the obligor (the lawyer here).

In this case, the lawyer's promise was to hire the student upon passing the bar. That's a future position, but it's not clear if it's based on personal abilities. The student worked for the lawyer and proved himself, but the assignment is to the roommate who is a fellow law student. The roommate is presumably similarly qualified, having passed the bar. So maybe the assignment is permissible.

But wait, the original agreement was based on the student's work for six months and then additional hours. The roommate didn't work those hours; the original student did. So, the lawyer's obligation arises because the student fulfilled the conditions. The student's right is the benefit of that obligation, which is the offer to hire upon passing the bar. So, the student is assigning that right, not the duty to work.

So, is the right to be hired assignable? Or is it a personal right that can't be assigned because it's based on the student's performance?

I think that the right to be hired is a benefit that can be assigned unless it's a personal service contract. The initial clerking was personal service, but the future employment is a separate promise. The question is whether that promise is assignable.

Another point: the assignment was of the right to be hired. The lawyer's obligation is to hire the student. If the student assigns that right, the roommate is stepping into the student's place. But the lawyer might argue that the contract was intended for the student, and they don't have to accept someone else.

But under contract law, unless the contract specifies that it's non-assignable, the right can be assigned. So, unless the agreement between the lawyer and student prohibits assignment, the assignment should be valid.

Looking at the options:

Option B says the assignment is invalid because neither the rights nor duties under a personal service contract are assignable. But is the right to future employment a personal service contract? I think the duty to work is a personal service, but the right to be hired is a different matter. Alternatively, maybe the promise to hire is part of the same personal service contract.

Alternatively, the original agreement was for the student to work and then get the job offer. So the right to the job offer is tied to the student's personal services. So assigning that might not be allowed because it's part of a personal service contract.

Wait, but the assignment is of the right to the job, not the duty to perform services. So, the student's duty was to work, which he did. Now, the right is the lawyer's obligation to hire upon passing the bar. So, can that right be assigned?

I think that the right to receive a job offer is a separate right from the duty to perform services. So, it's assignable unless the contract prohibits it. Since there's no mention of the contract prohibiting assignment, it should be assignable.

But option B says neither the rights nor duties under a personal service contract are assignable. If this is a personal service contract, then the rights (to be hired) can't be assigned. But I'm not sure if the right is part of a personal service contract.

Another angle: the contract's subject matter. If the lawyer was hiring the student based on his unique qualities, then the promise to hire in the future is a personal one. So, the assignment would not be valid because the lawyer doesn't want to hire someone else.

Wait, but the roommate is a fellow law student who also passed the bar. Maybe he's equally qualified. So, maybe the assignment is acceptable. But the lawyer's obligation is to hire the student, not the roommate. So, unless the contract allows for substitution, the lawyer can refuse.

Alternatively, the assignment is of a right, not a duty. So, the lawyer's obligation is to the student. If the student assigns his right to the roommate, the lawyer must now recognize the roommate as having that right.

But if the original contract was a personal service contract, then perhaps the right is not assignable. Because the lawyer's obligation was to hire the student, not someone else.

Hmm. I think that the key is whether the right is assignable. In this scenario, the right to be hired is a benefit that the student earned by fulfilling the conditions. Assigning that benefit may not be allowed if it's part of a personal service contract.

So looking at the options, option B says that the assignment is invalid because neither rights nor duties under a personal service contract are assignable. But wait, the duty to perform services (the clerking) is a personal service, but the right to be hired is a separate right. So, the right might still be assignable unless it's part of the same personal service contract.

Wait, the original agreement was for the student to work as a clerk, and in exchange, the lawyer would hire him as an associate. So, the consideration was the clerking work. The promise to hire is consideration for that work. So, the right to be hired is tied to the personal services rendered by the student. Therefore, it's part of a personal service contract, making it non-assignable.

So, under that reasoning, option B would be correct because the right arises from a personal service contract and thus is not assignable.

Wait, but other sources say that the right to receive money or a benefit can be assigned, even if the original contract was for personal services. For example, a contract to paint a house: the painter can assign the right to payment, even though the duty to paint is personal. So, the duty is personal, but the right to payment can be assigned.

Similarly, in this case, the duty of the student to perform clerking is personal, but the right to be hired as an associate is a separate benefit that might be assignable.

Wait, but the right to be hired is a promise of future employment, which is more like a contractual right that isn't necessarily tied to personal services once the initial consideration (the clerking) has been performed. So, perhaps that right can be assigned.

Alternatively, the lawyer might argue that the entire agreement is a personal service contract, so the right to be hired is part of that and can't be assigned.

I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me think about the options again.

Option A: Lawyer must recognize assignment because roommate is qualified. But the question is about assignability, not qualification.

Option B: Assignment invalid because personal service contract. Maybe.

Option C: Lawyer doesn't have to recognize because original contract was with student. But that's not the issue; the issue is about assignment, not privity.

Option D: Lawyer must recognize, but can demand assurances. That could be if the assignment is valid but the lawyer has concerns about the roommate's ability.

Option E: Must recognize only if roommate can prove capability. But the assignment is about the right, not the duty.

Option F: Assignment invalid because not intended to be assignable. Unless the contract says so, it's generally assignable.

Option G: Assignment invalid because exchanged money. That doesn't make sense; assignments can be for consideration.

Option H: Lawyer must recognize, but demand financial assurances. Not sure why financial capacity matters.

Option I: Assignment invalid because it's a future assignment. But the assignment was of an existing right, not a future one.

Option J: Lawyer must recognize, so roommate is entitled. But if the assignment is invalid, this wouldn't hold.

So, going back, the key is whether the right to be hired as an associate is assignable. If it's part of a personal service contract, then it's not assignable. But if it's a separate right, then it is.

I think that the right to be hired is a benefit that's separate from the personal services already rendered. Since the student already fulfilled the clerking requirement, the promise to hire is a contractual right that can be assigned. So, the assignment should be valid, making the lawyer have to recognize it, unless there's another reason.

Wait, but the lawyer's obligation is to hire the student, not the roommate. So, if the student assigns the right, the lawyer's obligation would shift to the roommate. But if the contract was based on the student's personal qualities, the lawyer might have a right to refuse.

Alternatively, maybe the contract is viewed as a personal service contract, so the right is not assignable. So, option B would be correct.

I'm a bit torn between B and D. If the assignment is valid, the lawyer must recognize it, but perhaps can demand assurances. But if the assignment is invalid because it's a personal service contract, the lawyer doesn't have to recognize it.

I think the correct answer is B: the assignment is invalid because it's a personal service contract, so neither rights nor duties can be assigned. But wait, duties can't be assigned without consent, but rights can be unless it's a personal service contract.

Wait, another thought: The original agreement includes both the current clerking (personal service) and the future employment (a promise). The right being assigned is the future employment, which may not be a personal service right because it's a separate obligation. So, perhaps the right is assignable, making option B incorrect.

In that case, the assignment would be valid. So, the lawyer would have to recognize it. But wait, the lawyer's promise was to hire the student, so the lawyer might argue that the assignment is not permissible because the contract was for the student's personal services.

I'm getting more confused. Let me try to recall the rules. Generally, a right under a contract can be assigned unless:

- The contract prohibits assignment.
- The right is a personal, non-transferable right (like a contract for personal services where performance depends on the individual's unique abilities).
- Assignment would materially change the risk or duties of the obligor.

In this case, the right is to be hired as an associate. If the lawyer's obligation is to hire the student because of the student's specific qualities, then assigning that right to someone else (the roommate) might not be allowed because it changes the lawyer's obligation. The lawyer might not want to hire someone else, even if they're qualified.

But the roommate is a fellow law student who passed the bar, so perhaps the lawyer can't refuse based on qualifications. However, the assignment would force the lawyer to hire someone they didn't initially agree to, which could be against their will, especially if they had specific reasons for wanting the original student.

So, perhaps the right is not assignable because it's part of a personal service contract. Therefore, the lawyer doesn't have to recognize the assignment. That would make option B correct.

Alternatively, if the right to be hired is considered a separate benefit, then the assignment is valid. So, the lawyer would have to accept the roommate, but perhaps the lawyer can demand that the roommate prove they can perform adequately. That would be option D.

Wait, but option B says neither rights nor duties are assignable. But the assignment here is only of the right, not the duty. So, the roommate isn't taking on the duty to work as a clerk; he's just taking the right to be hired as an associate.

So, in that case, the assignment of the right might still be valid unless it's part of a personal service contract. Therefore, the correct answer might be that the assignment is valid, but the lawyer can demand assurances that the roommate is capable.

Looking at the options, option D says the lawyer must recognize the assignment but can demand adequate assurances of performance regarding the roommate's willingness and professional capacity.

Hmm, that makes sense. The assignment is valid, so the lawyer must accept the roommate, but the lawyer can ask the roommate to show he's capable of doing the job. So, the lawyer can't just refuse outright but can verify the roommate's qualifications.

Wait, but the roommate already passed the bar, so maybe that's sufficient. But the option says the lawyer is entitled to demand assurances. So, perhaps the correct answer is D.

But earlier I thought B might be correct. I'm a bit stuck.

Wait, the key here is whether the right is assignable. If it's part of a personal service contract, then it's not assignable. But if it's a separate right, then it is.

I think the original agreement was for the student's personal services as a clerk, and the promise to hire as an associate was consideration for those services. Therefore, the right to be hired is tied to the personal services, making it non-assignable. So, option B would be correct.

But I'm not entirely sure. Another approach: look for the correct rule.

Under common law, the general rule is that contract rights are assignable unless:

1. The assignment is prohibited by the contract.
2. The contract involves personal services, and the right is not transferable because the obligor (lawyer) has a substantial interest in having the original obligee (student) perform.
3. Assignment would materially change the risk or duties.

In this case, the right is the lawyer's promise to hire upon passing the bar. The duty to perform (clerking) was already done by the student. The right is the future employment. So, the right is a benefit that doesn't depend on the student's continued personal services. Therefore, it's assignable.

So, the lawyer would have to recognize the assignment. But the lawyer can demand that the roommate prove he's capable, as in option D.

Wait, but the assignment is of the right to be hired. The lawyer's duty is to hire the student upon certain conditions. If the student assigns that right, the lawyer's duty shifts to the roommate. So, the lawyer must hire the roommate, provided he meets the conditions.

But the conditions were that the student worked 10 hours a week. The roommate didn't do that; the student did. So, the condition was fulfilled by the student, so the lawyer's obligation is to hire the student. The student can't assign that obligation, but he can assign the right to the benefit (the job offer).

Wait, but the job offer is to the student. So, the lawyer is obligated to offer the job to the student, not the roommate. The student can assign the right to receive the offer, so the roommate would have the right to demand the offer. But the offer is for employment, which is a personal service. The lawyer can't be forced to hire someone else unless the contract allows it.

Hmm, I'm getting myself confused again.

Another angle: the assignment is of the right to be hired as an associate. The lawyer's obligation is to hire the student. Assigning that right would mean the lawyer must hire the roommate instead. But the lawyer might argue that the contract was for the student's services, and the future employment is part of that personal arrangement.

But the assignment is only transferring the benefit, not the burden. So, the student's duty was to work, which he did. The right is the lawyer's promise to hire upon passing the bar. So, the student can assign that right to the roommate, making the lawyer's obligation to hire the roommate.

But in the context of personal service contracts, the right to receive a job offer is part of the personal service arrangement. So, it's not assignable.

I think I'm overcomplicating. The correct answer is likely B because the original agreement was a personal service contract, and thus the right is not assignable.

So, I'll go with option B.
</think>

The scenario involves a law student who entered into an agreement with a lawyer to work as a clerk in exchange for a promise of future employment as an associate upon passing the bar exam. The student later assigned his right to be hired as an associate to his roommate for $100. The question is whether this assignment is valid and enforceable.

Key points of analysis:

1. **Nature of the Agreement**: The original agreement included both the student's clerking work (a form of personal service) and the lawyer's promise to hire the student as an associate in the future. The right to future employment is the benefit being assigned.

2. **Assignability of Contractual Rights**: Generally, contractual rights are assignable unless:
   - The contract prohibits assignment.
   - The right is personal and depends on the unique abilities or relationship of the original parties.
   - Assignment would materially change the obligor's duties or risks.

3. **Personal Service Contracts**: Personal service contracts are based on the unique skills or qualities of the
