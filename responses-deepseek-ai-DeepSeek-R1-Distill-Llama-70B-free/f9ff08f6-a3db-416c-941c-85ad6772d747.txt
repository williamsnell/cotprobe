Okay, so I've got this multiple-choice question about who said that "Jurisprudence is the eye of law." The options are A through J, each representing a different legal scholar or philosopher. I'm a bit rusty on my jurisprudence, but let me try to work through this.

First, I'll try to remember what each of these thinkers is known for. Let's go through them one by one.

Option A is Pound. Roscoe Pound was an American jurist who talked a lot about sociological jurisprudence. I think he emphasized the importance of law in society and how it adapts to social needs. But I'm not sure if he's the one who used that specific phrase.

Option B is Austin. John Austin was a key figure in legal positivism. He's known for defining law as the command of a sovereign, backed by sanctions. I don't recall him using the "eye of law" metaphor, though.

Option C is Savigny. Friedrich Carl von Savigny was a German jurist associated with the historical school of jurisprudence. He focused on law as a product of the people's spirit and history. Not sure about the quote here.

Option D is Hart. H.L.A. Hart was a British legal philosopher known for "The Concept of Law." He talked about law as a system of rules, primary and secondary. Doesn't ring a bell with this particular phrase.

Option E is Bentham. Jeremy Bentham was a utilitarian and the founder of modern legal positivism. He's famous for the phrase "the greatest happiness for the greatest number." Not sure about the eye quote.

Option F is Dworkin. Ronald Dworkin was a contemporary legal philosopher who argued against legal positivism, emphasizing that law is more than just rules—it includes principles. Not sure about this one either.

Option G is Blackstone. William Blackstone wrote "Commentaries on the Laws of England," which was a comprehensive overview of English law. He structured his work in a way that was very influential. Now, the phrase "eye of law" sounds like it could be from someone in the more classical or foundational legal texts. Blackstone's Commentaries are foundational, but did he use that exact phrase?

Option H is Laski. Harold Laski was a political theorist who wrote about pluralism and the state. I don't think he's associated with that quote.

Option I is Kelsen. Hans Kelsen was an Austrian jurist known for the pure theory of law, which posits that law is a hierarchical system of norms. Not sure about the quote.

Option J is Maine. Henry Maine was a British jurist and historian who wrote about the movement from status to contract in societies. He's known for "Ancient Law," but I don't remember him saying that.

Wait, I'm trying to think if any of these are known for using metaphors about the eye. The phrase "eye of law" suggests something that gives insight or perspective into the law. Maybe someone who wrote about the structure or purpose of jurisprudence.

I'm starting to lean towards Blackstone. His Commentaries were so influential, and he organized his work in a way that provided a clear view of the law. The "eye" could symbolize insight or perspective, which a commentary would provide.

Alternatively, could it be someone else? Maybe Savigny, because he was part of the historical school and had a particular view of law's development. But I'm not certain.

Wait, another approach: the phrase "eye of the law" might be a translation from another language. For example, Savigny wrote in German, so maybe the original quote was in German and translated as "eye of law." But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps it's from an older source. Blackstone's work is in English, so maybe he used that phrase. I'm trying to recall if he had any metaphors about the eye. His Commentaries were meant to make the law accessible, so maybe he referred to jurisprudence as the eye that sees through the law.

Another thought: the "eye" could refer to the lens through which law is viewed. So jurisprudence, being the philosophy or theory of law, would provide that lens. So who is known for that perspective?

I'm starting to think that the answer might be G: Blackstone. Because he's so foundational, and the phrase sounds like something he might say in his Commentaries. Alternatively, I'm not certain, but among the options, Blackstone seems plausible.

Wait, another angle: sometimes in legal history, the term "eye of the law" refers to the role of the judge or the court as the interpreter. But that's more about applying the law rather than jurisprudence itself.

Alternatively, perhaps it's Maine, who talked about the progression of legal thought. But I can't recall the exact phrase.

I'm going to go with G: Blackstone. I think he's the most likely to have used a phrase like that in his Commentaries.

The question asks who said that "Jurisprudence is the eye of law." To determine the answer, I analyzed the options provided, considering the contributions and writings of each legal scholar and philosopher. 

- **Pound (A)**: Known for sociological jurisprudence, but no clear connection to the phrase.  
- **Austin (B)**: A legal positivist who defined law as a sovereign's command, not linked to the metaphor.  
- **Savigny (C)**: Associated with the historical school, but the phrase doesn't align with his known works.  
- **Hart (D)**: Focused on law as a system of rules, but no evidence of using this phrase.  
- **Bentham (E)**: A utilitarian, famous for "the greatest happiness for the greatest number," not the eye metaphor.  
- **Dworkin (F)**: Emphasized law as including principles, but no connection to the phrase.  
- **Blackstone (G)**: Wrote foundational "Commentaries on the Laws of England," which provided a clear view of the law. The phrase "eye of law" could symbolize the insight his work offered.  
- **Laski (H)**: A political theorist, not associated with this quote.  
- **Kelsen (I)**: Known for the pure theory of law, but no link to the phrase.  
- **Maine (J)**: Discussed legal evolution, but no evidence of using the phrase.  

Given the analysis, Blackstone's influential work and the metaphorical significance of "eye of law" as a lens for understanding jurisprudence make him the most plausible choice.
