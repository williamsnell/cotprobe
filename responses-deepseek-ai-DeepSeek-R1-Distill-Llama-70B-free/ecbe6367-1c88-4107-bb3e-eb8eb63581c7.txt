Okay, so I've got this problem here about a brass rod carrying a current, and I need to find the dissipated power per centimeter of length. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that power dissipation in a conductor is related to the current density and the material's conductivity. Oh right, the formula for power dissipation per unit volume is J squared divided by sigma, where sigma is the conductivity. So P = J² / sigma. But wait, I need to find the power per unit length, so I'll probably have to integrate this over the cross-sectional area.

The problem gives me J as a function of r, the radial distance from the center. J = 0.01 e^(pi r) sin(omega t + pi r) A/cm². Hmm, that's a bit tricky because it's varying with r. Oh wait, but when calculating the instantaneous power, the sine squared term would come in. Also, since power is the average over time, maybe the time average of sin squared is 1/2. So for the average power, I can take the square of the amplitude and multiply by 1/2.

Wait, let me think again. The instantaneous power is J·E. Oh, but E is related to J by sigma, E = J / sigma. Oh wait, no, wait. Ohm's law in point form is J = sigma E. So E = J / sigma. So the power dissipated per unit volume is J · E = J² / sigma. Right, so the instantaneous power is J² / sigma. For the average power, since J is sinusoidal, the average would be half of the peak value squared.

So I need to find the average power per unit volume, then integrate that over the volume to get the power per unit length.

The rod is a cylinder with radius 2.1 cm. So the cross-sectional area is pi r², but since the current density J varies with r, I need to integrate J squared over the area.

Wait, J is given as 0.01 e^{pi r} sin(omega t + pi r). So the amplitude of J is 0.01 e^{pi r}. But wait, r is in cm, right? Because the problem states r is the distance in centimeters from the center.

So the power per unit volume at a distance r is (J_rms)^2 / sigma. Since J is sinusoidal, J_rms is J_peak / sqrt(2). But wait, the average power is (J_peak^2 / 2) / sigma.

So the average power per unit volume is (0.01^2 e^{2 pi r} sin^2(...)) / (2 sigma). But sin^2 averages to 1/2 over a full cycle, so when taking the time average, the power becomes ( (0.01 e^{pi r})^2 ) / (2 sigma) ) * (1/2) ?

Wait no, wait. Let me clarify. The instantaneous power is J^2 / sigma. The time average would be (1/(2π)) ∫ J^2 dt over a full period. Since J is sinusoidal, the square would give a sine squared term, which averages to 1/2. So the average power per unit volume is (J_peak)^2 / (2 sigma) * 1/2? Or is it (J_peak^2)/ (2 sigma) multiplied by 1/2?

Wait, no. Let me think again. J(t) = J0 sin(wt + phi), so J^2 = J0² sin²(...). The average of sin² over a period is 1/2. So the average power per unit volume is (J0²) / (2 sigma) ) * (1/2)? Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, no: the average of J^2 is (J0^2 / 2), so the average power density is (J0^2 / 2) / sigma.

Wait, no, the power density is J·E, but E is J/sigma. So J·E = J²/sigma. So the average would be (J0² / 2) / sigma. Because J² averages to J0²/2.

So the average power per unit volume is (J0^2) / (2 sigma). So in this case, J0 is 0.01 e^{pi r}, so J0 squared is (0.0001) e^{2 pi r}.

So the average power per unit volume is (0.0001 e^{2 pi r}) / (2 sigma).

But wait, sigma is given as 1.57e5 mhos/cm. Oh wait, mhos is siemens, which is S. So sigma is 1.57e5 S/cm. But I should convert units to make sure everything is consistent. Wait, power is in watts (W), which is volts·amperes (V·A). But since we're dealing with per unit volume, perhaps the units for sigma need to be in S/cm.

Wait, but wait: let me think in terms of units. Let me make sure I handle the units correctly.

But perhaps for calculation, it's easier to convert all units to SI units.

Wait, but the problem asks for the answer in micro watts per cm. So maybe it's easier to keep everything in cm units, but J is in A/cm², sigma in S/cm.

Wait, the unit of power is W = J/s. Power per unit volume is W/m³, but here we're looking for power per cm length. So perhaps it's better to calculate in terms of cm.

But let me try to proceed.

The power per unit volume is (J0²)/(2 sigma). So for each r, the power per unit volume is ( (0.01 e^{pi r})^2 ) / (2 * sigma ).

Then, to find the total power per unit length, I need to integrate this over the cross-sectional area. Since the rod is circular, I'll use polar coordinates. The area element dA is 2 pi r dr, where r is the radial distance from the center, ranging from 0 to 2.1 cm.

So the total power per unit length P is the integral from r=0 to r=2.1 cm of [ (0.01 e^{pi r})^2 / (2 sigma) ) ] * 2 pi r dr.

Wait, let's write that out:

P = ∫ (from 0 to R) [ (0.01 e^{pi r})^2 / (2 sigma) ) ] * (2 pi r) dr

Where R is 2.1 cm.

Simplify the constants:

(0.01)^2 = 1e-4.

So,

P = (1e-4) / (2 sigma) ) * 2 pi ∫ (e^{2 pi r}) * r dr from 0 to R.

Wait, the 2 in the numerator (from 2 pi r dr) and the denominator (2 sigma) would cancel each other.

So,

P = (1e-4) / sigma ) * pi ∫ (e^{2 pi r} * r ) dr from 0 to R.

Now, sigma is 1.57e5 S/cm. Let me plug that in:

sigma = 1.57e5 S/cm.

So,

P = (1e-4) / (1.57e5) ) * pi ∫ (e^{2 pi r} * r ) dr from 0 to 2.1.

Hmm, let me compute the constants first.

(1e-4) / (1.57e5) = 1e-4 / 1.57e5 = (1 / 1.57) ) * 1e-9 = approx 0.6368e-9 = 6.368e-10.

Wait, 1 / 1.57 is approximately 0.6368.

So 1e-4 / 1.57e5 = (1e-4) / (1.57e5) = (1 / 1.57) ) * 1e-4 / 1e5 ) = 0.6368 * 1e-9 = 6.368e-10.

So P ≈ 6.368e-10 * pi * ∫ e^{2 pi r} r dr from 0 to 2.1.

Now, the integral ∫ r e^{a r} dr from 0 to b is a standard integral. The antiderivative is (e^{a r} (a r - 1 )) / a² + C. Let me verify:

The integral of r e^{a r} dr is e^{a r} (r/a - 1/a²) ) + C.

Wait, let me differentiate e^{a r} (r/a - 1/a²):

d/dr [ e^{a r} (r/a - 1/a²) ) ]

= e^{a r} * a (r/a - 1/a²) ) + e^{a r} (1/a )

= e^{a r} [ a*(r/a) - a*(1/a²) + 1/a ]

= e^{a r} [ r - (1/a) + 1/a ]

= e^{a r} r.

Yes, correct. So the integral is e^{a r} (r/a - 1/a²) evaluated from 0 to b.

So in our case, a = 2 pi.

The definite integral from 0 to R is:

[e^{2 pi R} ( R/(2 pi) - 1/( (2 pi)^2 )) ) ] - [e^{0} ( 0/(2 pi) - 1/( (2 pi)^2 )) ) ]

Simplify:

= e^{2 pi R} [ R/(2 pi) - 1/(4 pi²) ) ] - [ 1 * ( 0 - 1/(4 pi²) ) ]

= e^{2 pi R} [ R/(2 pi) - 1/(4 pi²) ) ] + 1/(4 pi² )

So that's the integral value.

Now, plugging in R = 2.1 cm.

So let me compute each term.

First, compute 2 pi R: 2 * pi * 2.1 ≈ 6.2832 * 2.1 ≈ 13.19472.

e^{13.19472} is a huge number. Let me see:

Wait, e^13 is approximately 442413, e^0.19472 is about e^0.19 ≈ 1.208. So e^13.19472 ≈ 442413 * 1.208 ≈ around 534,300.

But perhaps I can keep it symbolic for now.

So the integral is:

e^{13.19472} [ (2.1)/(2 pi) - 1/(4 pi²) ) ] + 1/(4 pi² )

Compute the terms inside the brackets:

(2.1)/(2 pi) = (2.1)/(6.2832) ≈ 0.334.

1/(4 pi^2) = 1/(4 * 9.8696) ≈ 1/39.478 ≈ 0.0253.

So the term inside is 0.334 - 0.0253 = 0.3087.

So the first part is e^{13.19472} * 0.3087.

The second term is 0.0253.

So the integral is approximately 0.3087 * e^{13.19472} + 0.0253.

But wait, e^{13.19472} is about 534,300. So 0.3087 * 534,300 ≈ 0.3087 * 5e5 ≈ 1.5435e5 (since 0.3 *5e5 is 15e4, 0.0087 *5e5 ≈ 4350, so total ≈ 154,350).

Adding the second term 0.0253 gives about 154,350.0253, which is approximately 1.5435e5.

Wait, but wait, that can't be right because 0.3087 * 5e5 is 154,350, yes. So the integral is about 1.5435e5.

Wait, but I'm not sure about the exact value. Maybe I should compute it more accurately.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute 2 pi R = 2 * 3.1416 * 2.1 = approx 13.1946.

e^13.1946 ≈ e^13 is about 442413, e^0.1946 is about e^0.19 is 1.208, so e^13.1946 ≈ 442413 * 1.208 ≈ 534,000.

So the first term is 534,000 * 0.3087 ≈ 534,000 * 0.3 = 160,200; 534,000 * 0.0087 ≈ 4,645.8 → total ≈ 164,845.8.

Then adding 0.0253 gives ≈ 164,845.8 + 0.0253 ≈ 164,845.8253.

Wait, but that seems a bit high. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a calculator for more precision, but since I'm working this out manually, I'll proceed with approximate values.

So the integral is approximately 1.648e5.

Wait, but let me double-check: 0.3087 * e^{13.1946}.

Compute 13.1946: Let me compute e^13.1946.

We can write 13.1946 = 13 + 0.1946.

e^13 = 442413.

e^0.1946 ≈ 1.214 (since e^0.2 ≈ 1.2214, so 0.1946 is a little less, say about 1.214).

So e^13.1946 ≈ 442413 * 1.214 ≈ let's compute 442413 * 1 = 442,413, 442,413 * 0.2 = 88,482.6, 442,413 * 0.014 = approx 442413 * 0.01 is 4,424.13, 0.004 is 1,769.25 → total 6,193.38.

So 442,413 + 88,482.6 = 530,895.6 + 6,193.38 ≈ 537,088.98.

So e^13.1946 ≈ 537,089.

So 0.3087 * 537,089 ≈ 537,089 * 0.3 = 161,126.7, 537,089 * 0.0087 ≈ 4,671.57 → total about 165,798.27.

Adding the 0.0253 gives 165,798.27 + 0.0253 ≈ 165,798.2953.

So the integral is approximately 165,798.3.

Wait, but wait, this seems really large. Did I make a mistake in the units?

Wait, J is given in A/cm², and the conductivity is in S/cm. But when I compute the integral, I'm using cm for r, so the exponential is dimensionless, the units inside are okay.

Wait, but let me think about the units again. Let me make sure the units work out for the power.

Power per unit length is in watts per centimeter (W/cm). Wait, but usually, power is in watts (Joules per second), and per unit length would be W/m or similar. But the problem specifies the answer in micro W per cm, so perhaps the units are correct.

But let me make sure the integral is correct. The integral is ∫ r e^{2 pi r} dr from 0 to 2.1 cm.

Wait, 2 pi r is 2 * 3.1416 * r, and r is in cm, so the exponent is unitless? Wait, no, because 2 pi has units of radians, which is dimensionless. So 2 pi r (cm) would have units, but wait, no—radians are just numbers, so 2 pi r is dimensionless. So the exponent is correct.

Wait, but in the integral, r is in cm, so when I compute e^{2 pi r}, r is in cm, which makes the exponent unitless because 2 pi is in rad/cm? No, wait, 2 pi is just a number, so 2 pi r (cm) would have units of cm, which can't be in the exponent. Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, no, wait—no, the exponent must be dimensionless. So 2 pi r must have units of 1/cm * cm → unitless? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, no, in the problem statement, r is in centimeters, so when the exponent is written as e^{pi r}, that would mean pi (dimensionless) multiplied by r (cm), which has units of cm. But exponents must be dimensionless. So this is a problem. Oh wait, I think I misread the problem.

Wait, looking back: the current density is given as J = 0.01 e^{pi r} sin(omega t + pi r) A/cm². But wait, pi r would have units of cm, which can't be in the exponent. So that suggests that perhaps the exponent is actually in terms of r over some length scale, maybe radius over a characteristic length, making it dimensionless.

Wait, perhaps the exponent is (pi r)/a, where a is a length. But the problem states that r is in cm, so e^{pi r} would have units if r is in cm. That can't be right. So perhaps the exponent is (pi r) / (something), but in the problem statement, it's written as e^{pi r}.

Wait, maybe the original equation is actually e^{(pi r)/r0}, where r0 is a constant. But the problem says e^{pi r}, so perhaps it's a typo, and it should be e^{(pi r)/a}, where a is given, but no, the problem doesn't state that. Alternatively, perhaps it's e^{(pi r)/R}, where R is the radius of the rod, 2.1 cm. But that's speculation.

Wait, perhaps the exponent is pi multiplied by r without any scaling, but that would make it impossible because e^{cm} is not possible. So perhaps the problem intended for r to be in units where the exponent is dimensionless, which would require r to be dimensionless, but that's not the case here. Hmm, this is confusing.

Alternatively, perhaps the exponent is e^{(pi r)/ (lambda)}, where lambda is a length scale, but the problem doesn't mention that. Alternatively, perhaps it's a typo and the exponent should be pi
