Question:

Two cars were driving within the legal speed limit as they approached an intersection. There are no traffic lights, stop signs, or warnings posted at this intersection. Both vehicles entered the intersection simultaneously and collided. In the accident, one of the drivers suffered a broken pelvis and internal injuries. Although the other driver's truck was slightly damaged, he did not suffer any physical injuries. Thereafter, the injured driver sued the city for negligence, claiming that the city failed to provide adequate warning at the intersection, which she contended was particularly dangerous and heavily traveled. At trial, the city attorney offers evidence that the intersection has been the same for 14 years, and no other accidents have occurred during that time. Upon objection by the injured driver's attorney, this evidence should be

Options:

A: excluded, because it is improper negative evidence.
B: admitted as relevant evidence of a fact of consequence to the action.
C: admitted, as it is critical for the jury to understand the history of the intersection.
D: excluded, because the dangers of unfair prejudice and confusion of the issues may tend to mislead the jury.
E: admitted, but only if the city can prove that there have been no significant changes in traffic patterns in the last 14 years.
F: excluded, because it can potentially bias the jury against the injured driver.
G: excluded, because it is irrelevant to the current accident.
H: admitted, as it shows the city's negligence in maintaining the intersection.
I: excluded, as it is not directly related to the case at hand.
J: admitted, provided that the jury is instructed about the danger of inferential negative evidence.

Okay, so I have this multiple-choice question about evidence law, specifically dealing with negligence and the admissibility of certain evidence. Let me try to break this down.

The scenario is that two cars were driving within the speed limit and collided at an intersection with no traffic lights, stop signs, or warnings. The injured driver is suing the city, claiming they failed to provide adequate warning, making the intersection dangerous. The city's attorney wants to present evidence that for 14 years, no other accidents occurred there. The injured driver's attorney objects, and I need to determine if this evidence should be admitted or excluded.

Hmm, I remember that evidence law has rules about what's relevant and what's not. The key issue here is whether the absence of prior accidents is relevant to the city's negligence. 

So, the city's argument is probably that since there were no other accidents in 14 years, the intersection isn't particularly dangerous, so their lack of warning signs wasn't negligent. The injured driver's side is likely arguing that the absence of prior accidents isn't relevant because the mere occurrence of this accident shows the danger, and past safety doesn't necessarily mean it's safe now.

Wait, in evidence law, I think about relevance. For evidence to be admissible, it must be relevant, meaning it has to make a fact of consequence more or less likely than it would be without the evidence. So, does the fact that there were no prior accidents make it less likely that the city was negligent?

I recall something about "negative evidence." This is when evidence is presented that something didn't happen in the past. For example, that no accidents occurred before. But such evidence can be problematic because it might be considered irrelevant or could be prejudicial.

I think the rule is that evidence of the absence of prior accidents can be relevant if it's probative of a particular fact. Like, if the defendant is arguing that the intersection wasn't dangerous, then showing that no one else had an accident there before could support that. But there's also a concern about whether this kind of evidence might be more prejudicial than probative, leading to unfair bias.

Wait, the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) 402 says that evidence is relevant if it has any tendency to make a fact more or less probable. But under FRE 403, even relevant evidence can be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice, confusion, etc.

So, the city's evidence is that no accidents happened for 14 years. Is this relevant? It's relevant because it goes to whether the intersection is dangerous. If no one else had an accident, maybe it's not as dangerous as the plaintiff claims. But could it be excluded under 403? Maybe, but I think such evidence is generally admissible unless it's unduly prejudicial.

Wait, but wait, I remember a concept called "negative evidence" or "absence of prior accidents." I think courts have held that evidence of no prior accidents is admissible to show that a condition is not dangerous. It's a recognized use of negative evidence. So, in this case, the city's evidence is being used to show that the intersection isn't particularly dangerous, which would undermine the plaintiff's claim that the city was negligent in not providing warnings.

But the options are about whether it's admitted or excluded. Let me look at the options:

Option A: Excluded because improper negative evidence. I don't think that's right because negative evidence can be proper if it's relevant.

Option B: Admitted as relevant. That makes sense because it goes to a fact of consequence (whether the intersection was dangerous).

Option C: Admitted for the jury to understand history. Maybe, but the key is relevance, not just background.

Option D: Excluded because of unfair prejudice. I'm not sure. If the evidence is relevant, it's usually allowed unless 403 applies. But I don't see a clear reason here why it would be so prejudicial that it's excluded.

Option E: Admitted only if no changes in traffic. That's an additional condition. I don't think the rule requires that unless it's a factor, but maybe it's a consideration for relevance.

Option F: Excluded because of bias. I don't see how it would bias the jury against the plaintiff directly. It's more about the city's defense.

Option G: Excluded as irrelevant. No, because it's relevant to the dangerousness of the intersection.

Option H: Admitted as showing city's negligence. Wait, no, the city is using it to show they weren't negligent. So H is the opposite.

Option I: Excluded, not directly related. No, it's directly related to the claim of dangerousness.

Option J: Admitted with jury instruction about inferential negative evidence. I'm not sure, but I don't recall a specific requirement for a jury instruction on this point. The evidence itself is admissible as relevant.

So, putting it together, the evidence is relevant because it speaks to the dangerousness of the intersection. Therefore, it should be admitted. Looking at the options, B says it's admitted as relevant evidence. J says it's admitted with an instruction, but I don't think that's necessary.

Wait, but I also recall that sometimes courts exclude evidence of no prior accidents because it's not very probative. For example, in products liability, evidence that no one else was injured might not be allowed because accidents can be rare but still possible. But in this case, it's about an intersection's safety, which seems more directly related.

So I think the correct answer is B: admitted as relevant evidence of a fact of consequence. Alternatively, option J says admitted with an instruction, but I don't think that's required here. The evidence is relevant on its face.

Wait, another thought: the problem is that the absence of prior accidents might be given undue weight by the jury. Like, they might think, "Well, if no one else had an accident, it's not dangerous," but maybe the accident happened because it's dangerous, and that's why the plaintiff is suing. So is the evidence more prejudicial than probative?

But in general, I think this evidence is admissible. So the answer would be B.

The question revolves around the admissibility of evidence in a negligence case where the city seeks to introduce evidence that no prior accidents occurred at the intersection for 14 years. The injured driver's attorney objects, and the task is to determine whether this evidence should be admitted or excluded.

Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, relevance is the key criterion for admissibility. Evidence is relevant if it has "any tendency to make a fact more or less probable than it would be without the evidence." Here, the absence of prior accidents is being offered to show that the intersection is not particularly dangerous, which directly pertains to the plaintiff's claim that the city was negligent in failing to provide adequate warnings.

While negative evidence (e.g., the absence of prior accidents) can sometimes raise concerns about unfair prejudice or confusion, it is generally admissible if it is probative of a fact of consequence. In this case, the evidence is relevant because it bears on the dangerousness of the intersection, which is central to the plaintiff's claim. There is no indication that the evidence is so prejudicial or confusing that it should be excluded under Rule 403.

Analyzing the options:

- **Option A**: Incorrect. Negative evidence is not inherently improper; it can be relevant in certain contexts.
- **Option B**: Correct. The evidence is relevant because it pertains to the dangerousness of the intersection, a fact of consequence in the case.
- **Option C**: Incorrect. While understanding the intersection's history may be helpful, the key issue is relevance, not merely providing background.
- **Option D**: Incorrect. There is no clear indication that the evidence would cause unfair prejudice or confusion significant enough to warrant exclusion.
- **Option E**: Incorrect. The admissibility of the evidence does not depend on proving no changes in traffic patterns unless such changes are directly relevant.
- **Option F**: Incorrect. The evidence does not inherently bias the jury against the plaintiff; it is part of the city's defense.
- **Option G**: Incorrect. The evidence is not irrelevant; it directly relates to the intersection's safety.
- **Option H**: Incorrect. The evidence is being used to defend against negligence, not to prove it.
- **Option I**: Incorrect. The evidence is directly related to the case, as it addresses the intersection's dangerousness.
- **Option J**: Incorrect. While jury instructions are important, there is no specific requirement for an instruction on inferential negative evidence in this context.

The evidence is admissible because it is relevant to the dangerousness of the intersection, a central issue in the case. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**B: admitted as relevant evidence of a fact of consequence to the action.**

Answer: B
