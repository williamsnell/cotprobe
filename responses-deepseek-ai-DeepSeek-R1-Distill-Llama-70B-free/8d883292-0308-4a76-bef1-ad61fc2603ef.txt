Okay, so I have this physics problem here about a laser beam and its size when it reaches the moon. Hmm, I'm a bit rusty on this, but let me think through it step by step.

Alright, the question says that a laser with a wavelength of 694 nm is used. The beam is expanded to a diameter of 1 meter and then collimated. I need to estimate its size at the moon, given that the moon is about 3.8e5 km away. The options are from 0.3 km to 3 km, so the answer is probably in that range.

Wait, I remember something about laser beams spreading over distance. Oh right, it's about diffraction. Laser beams tend to spread out due to diffraction, and the minimum angle they spread is determined by their wavelength and the aperture size.

The formula for the diffraction angle comes to mind. I think it's theta = 1.22 * lambda / D, where lambda is the wavelength and D is the diameter of the aperture. Oh wait, yeah, that's the formula for the angular resolution limit, but it also applies here for the beam divergence.

So theta would be the angle at which the beam spreads. Once I have theta, I can find the size of the beam at the moon by multiplying that angle (in radians) by the distance to the moon.

Let me jot down the numbers. Lambda is 694 nm. Oh wait, that's 694e-9 meters. D is 1 meter. The moon's distance is 3.8e5 km, which is 3.8e8 meters.

So theta = 1.22 * 694e-9 m / 1 m. Let me calculate that. 694e-9 is 6.94e-7. Multiply by 1.22 gives approx 8.46e-7 radians.

Wait, does that make sense? Because 1 radian is about 57 degrees, so 8.46e-7 radians is a very small angle, which makes sense for a laser.

Now, the beam's size at the moon would be the distance multiplied by theta. So size = distance * theta.

Distance is 3.8e8 meters. Size = 3.8e8 m * 8.46e-7 m. Let me do the multiplication.

3.8e8 * 8.46e-7 = (3.8 * 8.46) * 1e1. Because 1e8 * 1e-7 is 1e1 (10^1=10).

Calculate 3.8 *8.46. Let me compute that. 3.8 *8 is 30.4, 3.8 *0.46 is about 1.748. So total is around 32.148. Multiply by 10 gives 321.48 meters.

Wait, that's about 0.32 kilometers. But looking at the options, J is 0.3 km. So that would be the closest.

Wait, but wait a second. Did I mix up the formula? Because I think the formula gives the radius, but the diameter is twice that. So if the formula gives theta for the radius, then the diameter would be twice the size.

Wait no, the formula gives the angle for the first minimum, which relates to the radius of the central maximum in the far field. So when calculating the size of the beam, do I double the theta? Or just use theta as the total spread?

Wait, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The angle theta is the half-angle, meaning the beam spreads by theta on each side. So the total diameter would be 2 * theta * distance.

Wait, in that case, I should have multiplied by 2 somewhere. Let me check.

Wait no, perhaps not. The formula theta = 1.22 lambda / D gives the half-angle. So the radius at a distance L is theta * L, and the diameter is 2 theta L.

Wait, wait, no. Let me clarify. When the beam spreads, the diameter is determined by the angle. The formula gives the angle at which the first minimum occurs, which is the edge of the central spot. So the radius is theta * L, and the diameter is 2 theta L.

Wait, but in the calculation I did earlier, I got 321 meters as the size. But if that's the diameter, then the answer would be 0.32 km, which matches option J. But wait, did I calculate it correctly?

Wait, let's recalculate:

theta = 1.22 * 694e-9 / 1 = 1.22 * 694e-9 = let's compute that.

694e-9 is 0.000000694 meters.

So 1.22 * 0.000000694 = approximately 8.45e-7 radians.

Then, the moon's distance is 3.8e8 meters.

So the diameter of the beam is 2 * theta * distance.

Wait, no, theta is the half-angle. So the total diameter is 2 * (theta * distance). Because theta is the angle from the center to the edge, so the total spread is twice theta times the distance.

Wait, so size = 2 * theta * distance.

Earlier, I calculated theta * distance as 8.45e-7 * 3.8e8 = let me compute that again.

8.45e-7 * 3.8e8 = (8.45 * 3.8) * 1e1.

8.45 * 3.8: Let's compute 8*3.8=30.4, 0.45*3.8=1.71. So total is 32.11. So 32.11 * 10^1 is 321.1 meters. That's the diameter, right?

Wait, no, because theta was the half-angle. If theta is 8.45e-7 radians, then the radius is theta * distance, so the diameter is 2 * theta * distance. Wait, so I think I made a mistake earlier. Because I thought that when I calculated size = theta * distance, that was the diameter, but actually, that's the radius. So the diameter would be twice that, which would be about 642 meters, or 0.642 km.

Wait, wait, no. Let's get this straight. The angle theta is for the radius. So the radius at the distance L is theta * L. So the diameter is 2 * theta * L.

So in my calculation, theta * L was 321.1 meters, which would be the radius. So the diameter is 642.2 meters, which is 0.6422 km. Looking at the options, option I is 0.643 km, which is very close.

Wait, but why am I confused now? Because earlier I thought that the size I calculated was the diameter, but no, it's the radius.

So the correct approach is: compute theta as 1.22 * lambda / D, then the radius is theta * L, so the diameter is 2 * theta * L.

Wait, no, wait. The formula theta = 1.22 lambda/(D) gives the angle for the first minimum, which is the radius of the central maximum. So the diameter would be 2 theta. Wait, but when you project this angle over a distance L, the spot diameter is 2 theta L.

Wait, perhaps I'm mixing things up. Let me think again.

The beam's divergence angle is theta, which is 1.22 lambda / D. This angle is from the center to the edge, so the total diameter at distance L is 2 theta L.

So the correct formula is diameter = 2 * (1.22 lambda/D) * L.

So the calculation would be:

lambda = 694e-9 m

D = 1 m

theta = 1.22 * 694e-9 / 1 = 8.45e-7 radians.

diameter = 2 * theta * L.

L is 3.8e8 meters.

So diameter = 2 * 8.45e-7 * 3.8e8.

Let me compute this:

First, 8.45e-7 * 3.8e8 = (8.45 * 3.8) * 1e1.

As before, 8.45 *3.8 is ~32.11. So 32.11e1 is 321.1 meters.

Multiply by 2 gives 642.2 meters, which is 0.6422 km.

Looking at the options, option I is 0.643 km. So that's the answer.

Wait, but earlier I thought the initial calculation gave me 0.32 km, but that was without considering the factor of 2 for diameter. So the correct answer should be 0.643 km, which is option I.

So among the options:

I: 0.643 km.

Yes, that's the right choice.

To estimate the size of the laser beam at the moon, we use the concept of diffraction. The laser beam spreads due to diffraction, and the divergence angle is given by:

\[
\theta = \frac{1.22 \lambda}{D}
\]

where:
- \(\lambda = 694 \, \text{nm} = 694 \times 10^{-9} \, \text{m}\) (wavelength of the laser),
- \(D = 1 \, \text{m}\) (diameter of the laser aperture).

Substituting the values:

\[
\theta = \frac{1.22 \times 694 \times 10^{-9}}{1} = 8.45 \times 10^{-7} \, \text{radians}.
\]

The moon's distance is \(L = 3.8 \times 10^5 \, \text{km} = 3.8 \times 10^8 \, \text{m}\). The diameter of the laser beam at the moon is:

\[
\text{Diameter} = 2 \theta L
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Diameter} = 2 \times (8.45 \times 10^{-7}) \times (3.8 \times 10^8)
\]

First, calculate \(8.45 \times 10^{-7} \times 3.8 \times 10^8\):

\[
8.45 \times 3.8 = 32.11, \quad \text{so } 32.11 \times 10^1 = 321.1 \, \text{m}.
\]

Now multiply by 2 to account for the diameter:

\[
\text{Diameter} = 2 \times 321.1 = 642.2 \, \text{m} = 0.6422 \, \text{km}.
\]

Comparing this result to the options, the closest match is **I: 0.643 km**.
