Okay, so I have this problem here where Mr. Glass borrowed $250 from a finance company. He's supposed to repay it in five monthly installments. The interest is calculated at 3% a month on the first $150 and 2% a month on any amount over $150. I need to find out the total interest he's paying.

Hmm, wait, let me make sure I understand this correctly. So the total loan is $250. The interest is split: 3% per month on the first $150, and 2% per month on the amount exceeding $150. So the amount over $150 would be $100 because 250 minus 150 is 100. So each month, he's paying interest on two parts: $150 at 3% and $100 at 2%.

But wait, does the split apply each month, or is it based on the initial loan only? I think it's based on each payment because the loan amount reduces each month as he repays installments. Or maybe it's calculated on the initial amount each time. Hmm, the problem statement says "on any part of the loan over $150." So perhaps each month, the interest is calculated on the remaining balance, with the same tiers.

Wait, but the way it's phrased is a bit ambiguous. Let me read the question again. It says, "interest at 3% a month on the first $150 and 2% a month on any part of the loan over $150." So perhaps this is how the interest is calculated each month on the outstanding amount.

So each month, whatever the remaining balance is, the first $150 of it is charged 3% interest, and any amount above that is charged 2%. That makes sense because the total is $250. So initially, the first $150 is at 3%, and the remaining $100 at 2%.

But wait, when he starts repaying, each installment probably reduces the principal, so the next month's outstanding balance would be lower. So I think I need to calculate the interest each month based on the remaining balance each time.

Wait, but the problem says he repays in five monthly installments. So he makes five equal monthly payments. That suggests that each payment is the same amount, but the allocation between principal and interest changes each month.

So perhaps the total interest is the sum of the interest each month for five months.

But wait, the question is about the total interest cost, not the total amount paid. So I need to compute how much interest he pays each month and sum it up.

Let me try to model this.

Let me denote the loan amount as $250, to be repaid in 5 equal installments. Each installment is the same amount, say P. But I don't know P yet. Wait, actually, the question doesn't give the installment amount, so perhaps I don't need it. Maybe the interest is calculated each month on the remaining balance, but the way the interest is split is based on the initial tiers.

Wait, perhaps it's simpler. Maybe the interest each month is calculated as 3% on the first $150 and 2% on the amount over $150 of the current outstanding balance.

But let me think again. So the first month, the balance is $250. So the first $150 is charged 3% interest, which is 150 * 0.03 = $4.50. The remaining $100 is charged 2%, which is 100 * 0.02 = $2. So total interest for the first month is $6.50.

Then, he makes a payment. But wait, how much is each payment? Since he's repaying in five monthly installments, each payment would be part principal and part interest. Hmm, but this is getting complicated because each payment would consist of some principal and some interest. So the interest each month depends on the remaining principal after each payment.

Wait, but the problem doesn't specify whether the interest is calculated on the initial principal each month or on the remaining balance. This is a crucial point.

If the interest is calculated on the initial principal each month, then each month's interest would be the same. But that's probably not the case because typically, as you pay down the principal, the interest decreases.

Wait, the problem states: "repay the $250 in five monthly installments, with interest at 3% a month on the first $150 and 2% a month on any part of the loan over $150." Hmm, the wording is a bit unclear. It could mean that each month, the interest is calculated on the outstanding balance, with the same rate structure.

Alternatively, it could mean that the interest is calculated on the initial $150 at 3% per month, and on the initial $100 (since 250-150=100) at 2% per month, each month until it's paid off. But that seems less likely because the $100 would be paid off over time, so the interest on that part would decrease.

Wait, perhaps the interest is calculated each month on the outstanding balance, where any portion up to $150 is at 3%, and anything over is at 2%.

So let's model the first few months.

Month 1:
Outstanding: $250.
Interest calculation:
$150 * 0.03 = $4.50
$100 (since 250-150=100) *0.02 = $2.00
Total interest = $6.50
So total payment for the month would be P, which includes principal and interest. Wait, but the problem doesn't give the installment amount. So perhaps I need to calculate the interest each month based on the outstanding balance, and sum all the interests over five months.

Wait, but without knowing the payment amount, it's tricky. Because each month, part of the payment goes to interest and part to principal. So the outstanding balance reduces each month, which affects the next month's interest.

But the problem doesn't specify whether the payments are equal or not. Wait, no, it says "five monthly installments", which implies equal payments each month.

So each month, the borrower pays an equal amount, say P, which is part principal and part interest. The interest each month is calculated on the outstanding balance, split into the two tiers.

This sounds like an amortization schedule problem. So to compute the total interest, I need to calculate the interest each month for five months, considering the outstanding balance each time.

But since the problem doesn't give the payment amount P, perhaps it's assuming that the interest is calculated each month on the initial tiers. Or perhaps the interest is calculated each month on the same initial $150 and $100, regardless of payments. That would make the total interest each month the same.

Wait, that's a possibility. So each month, the interest is 3% on $150, which is $4.50, and 2% on $100, which is $2.00. So each month, the interest is $6.50.

Over five months, that would be 5 * $6.50 = $32.50. But that's not one of the options. The options are up to $30, with the highest being I: $30. So perhaps that approach is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the interest is calculated on the initial amount each month until it's paid. But that doesn't make much sense because as principal is paid down, the interest should decrease.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe the interest is calculated each month on the current outstanding balance, with the tiers applied each time.

Let me try to model this step by step.

Let's denote the initial loan as $250.

Each month, the borrower makes a payment P. Part of P goes to interest, and part to principal.

But since the payments are equal, P is the same each month.

The total amount to repay is principal plus interest. So the sum of all payments is 5P = 250 + total interest.

So 5P = 250 + I, where I is the total interest.

But without knowing P, I can't directly find I. Alternatively, perhaps we can calculate I by summing the interest each month based on the outstanding balance.

Let me try to compute the interest each month.

First, compute each month's interest and principal payment.

But to do that, I need to know the payment P. Since each payment is the same, perhaps I can find P using the present value of the loan.

Wait, the loan is an annuity. The formula for the monthly payment P on a loan is P = (Pv * r) / (1 - (1 + r)^-n), where Pv is the present value ( loan amount ), r is the monthly interest rate, and n is the number of payments.

But wait, in this case, the interest rate isn't a flat rate but a tiered rate. So each month, the interest is calculated as 3% on the first $150 of the outstanding balance and 2% on the amount over $150.

So the monthly interest isn't a single percentage of the outstanding balance, making the calculation more complicated.

Hmm, perhaps I should model each month's payment and interest step by step.

Let me attempt to outline the process.

Initial balance: $250

Each month, the interest is calculated as follows:

If the balance > $150, then the first $150 is charged 3%, and the remainder (balance - 150) is charged 2%.

So for the first month:

Balance = 250.

Interest = (150 * 0.03) + (100 * 0.02) = 4.5 + 2 = 6.5.

So total interest for month 1 is $6.5.

Then, the borrower makes a payment P. The payment consists of the interest plus principal. So P = interest + principal part.

But I don't know P yet. Alternatively, perhaps P is the same each month, so the sum of interest and principal each month is the same.

Wait, but without knowing P, perhaps I should make an assumption or find P such that after five payments, the balance is zero.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it, and the interest is calculated each month based on the initial tiers, not the remaining balance. So each month, it's 3% on $150 and 2% on $100, regardless of how much has been paid. That would make the interest each month the same: $6.50. For five months, that would be 5 * 6.5 = 32.5, but that's not one of the options. So perhaps that's not correct.

Alternatively, maybe the tiers are based on the initial loan, so the interest each month is 3% on the first $150 and 2% on the remaining $100, but only for the first month. Then, as the principal is paid down, the tiers are applied to the outstanding balance.

Wait, perhaps I should think that each month, the interest is calculated on the outstanding balance, applying the tiers.

So let's proceed step by step.

Month 1:

Outstanding balance: $250.00

Interest calculation:

First $150: 3% → 150 * 0.03 = $4.50

Remaining $100: 2% → 100 * 0.02 = $2.00

Total interest: $6.50

Payment made: P = ?

But I don't know P yet. Wait, but without knowing P, how can I proceed? Maybe I should assume that each payment is equal, so the principal paid each month increases as the interest part decreases.

Alternatively, perhaps I can calculate the payment P first. Since the loan is being repaid in five equal installments, each payment P includes part principal and part interest.

The formula for P when there's a tiered interest rate is complicated. Maybe an alternative approach is better.

Alternatively, perhaps the interest is calculated each month on the outstanding balance, and the borrower pays the interest plus some principal each month. But without knowing P, this might not be feasible.

Wait, maybe the problem is intended to be simpler. Perhaps the interest is calculated each month on the initial amounts, so the first $150 at 3% each month regardless of the payment, and the $100 at 2% each month. Then, the total interest would be calculated as:

Each month, interest is 3% of 150 plus 2% of 100, which is 4.5 + 2 = 6.5.

Over five months: 5 * 6.5 = 32.5. But this isn't one of the options, and the highest option is I: $30.

So perhaps this approach is incorrect.

Another approach: Maybe the interest tiers are applied to the initial $250, and each month's interest is based on the remaining balance, but the tiers are applied to the initial amount. So each month, the interest is calculated on the first $150 of the initial loan at 3%, and the remaining $100 at 2%, but only on the part that's still outstanding.

Wait, that's confusing. Let's think differently.

Perhaps the interest is calculated each month on the outstanding balance, with the first $150 at 3%, and anything over at 2%. So each month, the interest depends on the remaining amount.

So let's model each month:

We have to track the outstanding balance each month, calculate the interest, subtract the principal part of the payment, and proceed.

But to do that, I need to know the monthly payment P. Since the payments are equal, each P is the same. Let's find P.

The present value of an ordinary annuity formula is:

PV = P * [ (1 - (1 + r)^-n) / r ]

But in this case, the interest rate each month isn't a single rate. It's a blend based on the tiers. So this complicates things because the effective rate each month varies.

Alternatively, perhaps we can ignore the tiered interest and approximate, but that might not be accurate.

Wait, maybe the problem is simpler than I'm making it. Perhaps the interest is calculated once at the beginning, and each payment is part principal and part interest. But I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps the interest is calculated on the initial amount, and the total interest is the sum of the interest on each portion over five months.

So for the first $150, each month it's charged 3%, so over five months, that's 150 * 0.03 *5 = 150 *0.15= $22.50.

For the $100 over $150, each month it's charged 2%, so 100 *0.02 *5= $10.

So total interest is 22.50 +10= $32.50 again.

But that's not an option, so perhaps that's wrong.

Wait, another thought: perhaps the interest is calculated only on the initial $150 and $100, and each payment reduces the principal, so the interest for each tier is calculated each month on the remaining balance in that tier.

Wait, perhaps the $150 is a fixed principal portion, and the $100 is another.

Wait, maybe the initial $150 is charged 3% per month on the outstanding amount, and the $100 is charged 2% per month on its outstanding amount.

But then, each payment would first pay off the higher interest portion. Hmm, but that's only if the borrower chooses to, but the problem doesn't specify that.

Alternatively, perhaps the interest is calculated on each portion separately each month.

Wait, perhaps the total interest is calculated as follows:

Each month, 3% on the first $150 of the remaining balance, and 2% on the remaining part.

Let me try to model each month's interest and payment.

Let me attempt to build an amortization schedule for five months.

Let me define:

- Loan amount: $250

- Monthly interest calculation: first $150 at 3%, rest at 2%.

- Each month's payment is P, which is the same.

But without knowing P, perhaps I can find it by ensuring that after five payments, the balance is zero.

But this requires setting up equations.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to be simpler, and the interest is calculated each month on the entire outstanding balance, applying the tiers. So each month, the interest is computed based on the current balance, with the first $150 portion and the remainder.

So let's proceed step by step for each month.

Month 1:

Balance: $250

Interest:

$150 *0.03 = $4.50

$100 (250-150) *0.02 = $2.00

Total interest: $6.50

Payment P is made, which is interest + principal.

But P is same each month. So P = interest + principal.

Wait, but without knowing P, I can't find the principal part.

Wait, perhaps the problem assumes that each payment is entirely applied to principal after deducting the interest. So each payment P is split into interest and principal.

But without knowing P, perhaps I need to find P such that after five payments, the balance is zero.

This is getting complicated, but let's try.

Let me denote:

After each payment, the principal reduces. The interest each month depends on the current principal.

So for each month, interest is calculated as:

If principal >150, then 3% on first 150, 2% on rest.

Otherwise, if principal <=150, then 3% on the entire principal.

So let's model this.

Let me make a table for each month.

Initial principal: $250.00

Payment 1:

Interest = 150*0.03 + (250-150)*0.02 = 4.5 + 2 = 6.5

Principal payment = P - 6.5

New principal = 250 - (P -6.5) = 250 - P +6.5 = 256.5 - P

Payment 2:

If new principal >150:

Interest = 150*0.03 + (new_principal -150)*0.02

Else:

Interest = new_principal *0.03

But I don't know P, so perhaps I can set up equations for each payment.

This seems too involved without knowing P. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects a simpler approach, assuming that the interest is calculated each month on the initial $150 and $100, regardless of the payments. So each month, the interest is $4.50 + $2 = $6.50. Over five months, that's 5 *6.50 = $32.50, but that's not an option.

Alternatively, perhaps the interest is calculated only once on the initial amounts, so $150 at 3% and $100 at 2%, but that would be a total of $4.50 + $2 = $6.50, but that's for one month.

But the options don't include $6.50, and the question is about the total over five months.

Alternatively, perhaps the interest is calculated each month on the initial $150 and $100, so for each month, it's 3% on $150 and 2% on $100. So over five months, that's 5*(4.5+2) = 5*6.5=32.5. Again, not an option.

Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the interest is calculated annually, but the question says 3% a month and 2%
