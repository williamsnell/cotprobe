Okay, so I have this question about the median international income as of 2020, and I need to choose the correct answer from options A to J. Hmm, I'm a bit unsure about this, but I'll try to think it through.

First, I remember that median income refers to the middle value when all incomes are arranged in order. So half the people make more, and half make less. International median income would mean considering all countries around the world.

I think about global economics. There are a lot of countries with lower incomes, especially in developing regions. Countries like the USA and those in Western Europe have higher median incomes, but they are not the majority. Most of the world's population lives in countries with lower income levels.

Looking at the options, the choices range from $300 up to $50,000. That's a big range. I remember that in some countries, the average income is just a few thousand dollars a year. For example, I think India's average income is around $2,000 or so, but I'm not sure about the median.

Wait, but median and average can be different. The average might be skewed by high incomes in some countries, but the median is the middle point. So if half the world's population is in countries where income is lower, say around $10,000 or less, then the median would be on the lower side.

I've heard that globally, about half the world lives on less than $10,000 a year. But wait, is that the median? Or is it the average? I'm getting a bit confused. Let me think again.

I recall that the World Bank has data on global income. They might have information on median income. From what I remember, the median global income is somewhere in the lower thousands. I think it's around $3,000 to $5,000. But I'm not certain.

Wait, but looking at the options, $5,000 is option J, and $10,000 is option D. So if the median is around $5k, then J would be the answer. But I'm not 100% sure.

Alternatively, maybe it's higher. I've heard that by 2020, many countries have seen some growth. But considering the global distribution, there are a lot of people in low-income countries. So the median would still be low.

Another angle: the median income per capita globally. I've read somewhere that it's around $10,000. But that was maybe a few years back. Oh wait, that might have been the average, not the median.

Wait, if the median is the point where half the people earn less and half earn more, and considering that many countries have lower incomes, maybe the median is around $10,000. So option D.

But I'm a bit torn because I thought it was lower. Let me try to recall any specific data. I think in 2020, the global median income was estimated to be around $10,000. So that would make option D the correct answer.

Alternatively, I might be mixing up average and median. Let me think of it this way: if most people live in Asia, where incomes are lower, the median would be closer to the lower end. So perhaps $5,000 or $10,000.

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to think of some examples. The median income in the United States is around $30,000 to $40,000. But that's just the US. Globally, the majority of people are in countries with much lower incomes.

So if the median is where half the world's population is, and considering that a large portion of the global population lives in countries with incomes under $10,000, then the median would likely be lower than the US median.

Wait, but perhaps the median is actually higher than I think because some countries have higher populations but not extremely low incomes. For example, China's median income might be around $10,000. India's might be lower, maybe around $2,000. But when you take the global median, it's the middle value across all individuals, not averaged per country.

So the global median income would be the income level where half of all people worldwide have income below that and half above. If more people live in countries with lower incomes, the median would be lower.

I think I've read that the global median is around $10,000. Maybe that's the case. So the answer would be D: $10,000.

But I'm not entirely certain. Another way to think about it: the global GNI per capita is around $11,000 or so. But again, that's average, not median.

Wait, but the median might be lower. So perhaps the correct answer is J: $5,000. Or maybe D: $10,000.

I'm a bit confused now. I think I'll go with D: $10,000 as the median international income as of 2020.

The question asks for the median international income as of 2020. Median income refers to the middle value when all incomes are arranged in order, meaning half the population earns less and half earns more. Considering the global distribution, many countries have lower incomes, especially in developing regions, which pulls the median down.

Options range from $300 to $50,000. The United States and other high-income countries have median incomes around $30,000 to $40,000, but these are not representative of the global median. Most of the world's population lives in countries with lower income levels, such as India and China, where incomes are significantly lower.

The global median income is influenced by the large population in low-income countries. While the average global income might be higher due to high-income countries skewing the average, the median is lower because it represents the middle value across all individuals worldwide. Estimates suggest the global median income is around $10,000, which aligns with the idea that half the global population lives on less than this amount.

After considering the distribution of incomes and the influence of low-income countries, the most reasonable estimate for the median international income as of 2020 is $10,000.
